Introduction \n \nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) reflect ambitious development targets \nencompassing not only monetary measures of poverty, but also more comprehensive \nmeasures of development that quantify development in areas such as education, \ngender equality and health.1 By providing small scale financial services to those on \nlow incomes, microfinance is seen by many as one of the most significant of the \ninstruments to support these targets. Representing this hope, the United Nations \ndeclared 2005 the International Year of Microcredit with the goal of \u201cBuilding \nInclusive Financial Sectors to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals\u201d \n(International Year of Microcredit, n.d.).  \n \nNone the less, within the microfinance industry it is recognized that microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) that rely on aid funding will be subject to the vagaries of aid \nbudgets and will never to able to expand to the scale that will make a major change \nin poverty and related social indicators at a national level. The response has been to \nshift the focus of MFI activity from donor-driven schemes that channel subsidized \ncredit to borrowers to commercially-oriented operations charging interest rates that \ncover full costs and are thus financially self-reliant. This \u201ecommercialization of \nmicrofinance\u201f has prompted considerable debate as to how far it is compatible with \nthe original poverty reduction mission of MFIs (Montgomery and Weiss, 2005). One \ncommentator has gone so far as to refer to \u201ea battle for the soul of microfinance\u201f \n(Harford, 2008). This question cannot be answered a-priori and empirical evidence is \nneeded to clarify the extent to which there is indeed a trade-off between financial \nsustainability and achievement of the MDGs and related poverty targets. The trade- \noff can be examined in various ways. For example, one approach assesses the \nimpact on borrowers of interest rate increases that accompany the shift to a \ncommercially oriented microfinance sector (Dehejia et al, 2008 and Karlan and \nZinman, 2008). Another examines a large sample of MFIs covering a variety of \n 5 \ninstitutional forms and lending methodologies to see how far any dilution of poverty \nfocus (as proxied by loan size) can be associated with the MFI\u201fs lending \nmethodology, size or age. The authors conclude that for larger and older MFIs the \nresults are consistent with the view that \u201eas institutions mature and grow they focus \nincreasingly on clients that can absorb larger loans.\u201f (Cull et al, 2007 : 131?). This is \nnot necessarily \u201emission drift\u201f since more poor borrowers could still be served under a \ncommercial model, but it is a warning that even NGO MFIs may not be focusing \nprimarily on the very poor any more.  Conducting detailed and rigorous impact \nstudies is difficult and as one review paper has commented \u201ethirty years into the \nmicrofinance movement we have little solid evidence that it improves the lives of \nclients in a measurable way\u201f (Roodman and Murdoch 2009: 3-4). \n \nThis paper contributes to this debate by focusing on a case-study of a relatively new \ncommercially-oriented microfinance bank. It reports the analysis of survey data \ncollected in Pakistan in 2005 relating to the lending activity of the Khushhali Bank, \nthe first licensed microfinance bank in the country and one designed to operate on \ncommercial lines but with a social mission consistent with the MDGs, which in turn \nform the center-piece of the government\u201fs poverty reduction strategy (Government of \nPakistan 2003). The paper is distinct in a number of ways: it is based on a large \nnational survey of 2881 households, which is a far larger sample than is normal for \nthis type of study; it focuses on a country in which the microfinance sector is \nrelatively new and where little rigorous work has been conducted on the impact of \nmicrofinance; it applies a rigorous control group approach that addresses the main \nsources of bias; and it uses a wide range of outcome measures to capture the impact \nof lending on alternative dimensions of welfare.  \n \nII. Khushhali Bank Operations  \n \n 6 \nMicrofinance remains relatively little developed in Pakistan, although there has been \nrapid growth since 2000 starting from a low base. As of March 2008 there were \nestimated to be around 1.6 million active borrowers with an average loan size of Rs \n11,000 (less than $150) as compared with Rs 460,000 in the banking sector as a \nwhole. However, the potential market for microcredit is likely to be much larger than \nthis and the microfinance strategy of the State Bank of Pakistan targeted a total of 3 \nmillion borrowers by 2010.2 \n \n The Khushhali bank was founded in 2000 as the first initiative of the Microfinance \nDevelopment Program sponsored by the Asian Development Bank. It was an early \nversion of a commercially-oriented microfinance intervention with its share capital \ndrawn from 16 commercial banks. Whilst  operating alongside more conventional aid \nfunded MFIs, it has become the largest provider of microfinance in Pakistan, now \nproviding a range of loan products to over 360,000 active borrowers (nearly 25% of \nthe national total), whilst focusing on the core objective of operational self-sufficiency. \nIt is not a perfect case-study of a commercially oriented microfinance bank since \nalthough its objectives are commercial it has not yet achieved full financial self-\nsufficiency.  Even though its Annual Report for 2007 reports a profit before tax of \nRs156 million and a return on equity of 5%, these calculations do not net out the \neffect of the substantial interest rate subsidy from the Asian Development Bank and \nindependent estimates suggest that the operational self-sufficiency ratio is no more \nthan 80%.3 The most recent Annual Report for 2008 reports a profit after tax of Rs \n103 million but again this fails to remove the effect of any financial subsidy. Hence \nwhat we are examining is the impact of the lending of a bank that is aiming for \nfinancial viability but which is not yet operating on fully commercial lines. \n \nAs part of its social mission Khushhali targets clients who are \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cvery poor\u201d, \nbut not those who are \u201cdestitute\u201d (living off charity, or zakat) or the \u201cnon-poor\u201d, who \n 7 \nreceive enough income to pay income tax. In the sample drawn for this study in \n2005, more than 70% of the clients were below the official poverty line of the \nGovernment of Pakistan and 20% were at less than half of the caloric consumption of \nthose defined as poor.4 When data for this study was collected in 2005, the bulk of \nclients (60%) were in rural areas and roughly one-third were women, although \naccording to the bank\u201fs more recent Annual Reports both of those ratios have \ndeclined as the bank has expanded in the past few years.    \n \nAt the time of the survey the bank offered eligible clients uncollateralized micro-loans \nof Rs3,000 \u2013 Rs 30,000.5 The first loan would be between Rs 3,000-10,000 and loan \nsizes increase 20% with each cycle to a maximum of Rs 30,000.  The terms of the \nmicroloan vary between 3-12 months, to be repaid with interest on declining balances \nin equal monthly installments or in one bullet payment, depending on the purpose of \nthe loan. Loans were offered for investments in arable agriculture, in livestock or in \nmicro-enterprises to establish a new business or to purchase assets or working \ncapital for an existing business, but not for consumption. At the time of the survey in \n2005 the interest rate was 20% and the average loan per borrower was $142. This \nwas higher than that charged by other microfinance institutions and well above the \naverage lending rate of 11% reported in the IMF International Financial Statistics, \nhowever it is well below earlier estimates of the cost of borrowing from informal credit \nsources (Arif 1999).   \n \nAlthough the bank has introduced an individual scoring report to screen and classify \nclients according to the above eligibility criteria, it uses a group lending methodology \nunder which clients form groups called community organizations that can be male, \nfemale or mixed gender groups of between 3 to 25 members (usually 3-5 members in \nurban areas and 10-25 in rural) who provide personal guarantees to each other.  \n 8 \nLoans are made directly to individuals in the group, but if any one member of the \ngroup defaults then all members of that group become ineligible for loans.   \n \n \nIII. Research Methodology \n \nThe first question to be addressed in conducting any impact evaluation is: how to \nmeasure impact? Most microfinance programs are designed to encourage borrowers \nto invest their loans in their farms or microenterprises. The hope is that these \ninvestments will lead to higher profits, which will in turn lead to higher household \nincome, which will gradually lift client households out of poverty.  Microfinance may \nalso affect non-income measures of household welfare such as health, education or \nempowerment. Note that the effects of microfinance on these broader measures of \nwelfare may not be expected to be all positive. On the one-hand, households with \nmore profitable family farms or microenterprises may be able to afford textbooks for \ntheir school age children, or hire workers to help with duties previously required of \nfamily members.  On the other hand, the extra time required of household members \nin running a newly-profitable family farm or microenterprise may also lead to lower \nenrollment rates for school age children who are encouraged to skip school or drop \nout all-together in order to contribute to the business.   \n \nIn this study, we used the Khushhali Bank mandate of   \n \n\u201c\u2026providing micro-finance services to poor persons, particularly poor \nwomen for mitigating poverty and promoting social welfare and \neconomic justice through community building and social mobilization \nwith the ultimate objective of poverty alleviation.\u201d (Status and Nature \nof Business, from Khushhali Bank Annual Report 2004)  \n 9 \n \nas a guide in designing our study. Thus, we looked at what might be called \ntraditional, or at least, direct, impacts of microfinance on household business profits \nas well as broader measures of household welfare such as health, education, female \nempowerment and finally, poverty, as measured by food and non-food consumption-\nexpenditure.  \n \nTable 1 reports the summary statistics for the measures of household welfare used in \nthis study. Business profits for the different types of activities supported by Khushhali \nBank loans \u2013 agriculture and livestock farming as well as microenterprise - are \nmeasured by reported profits and sales. Consumption-expenditure, the basis for \nmeasuring official poverty statistics in Pakistan, measured as food expenditures, non-\nfood expenditures, medical expenditures and educational expenditures per child, \nindicates income effects of participation in the microfinance program. Non-income \nmeasures of household welfare are also included: the probability that children are in \nschool, absenteeism from school, the probability of seeking medical treatment if ill \nand the quality of that treatment (as measured by the degree of training of the \nprovider). Given the mandate to serve women particularly, we also looked at the \nimpacts of participation in the microfinance program on the empowerment of women, \nas measured by the extent to which female respondents in each household felt their \nopinions were taken into account in household decisions on things such as the \nchildren\u201fs upbringing (their schooling and marriage), financial matters (whether or not \nto borrow money, sell or purchase livestock, repair the home) and the female \nhousehold member\u201fs decision to work outside the home or participate in community \npolitical activities.   \n \nOnce the indicator of interest has been identified, a perfect impact evaluation needs \nto answer a counterfactual question: how does the status of participants in the \n 10 \nprogram as measured by those variables compare with how those same individuals \nwould have fared in the absence of the program? The problem with cross-sections of \ndata (observations on many individuals at a given point in time) is that at any given \npoint in time, individuals are observed to be either participants or not. Even panels of \ndata (observations on many individuals through time) are problematic since over time \nmany other things have happened to the individuals in addition to program \nparticipation and it is nearly impossible to separate out the impact of the program \nfrom all the other influences. In practice, researchers must settle for estimates of the \naverage impact of the program on a group of participants \u2013 the treatment group \u2013 \ncompared to a credible comparison group \u2013 a control group. The ideal control group \nis individuals who would have had outcomes similar to those in the treatment group if \nthe members of the treatment group had not participated in the program.  \n \nConstructing a control group comparable to the treatment group is not \nstraightforward. Participants in the program are usually different from non-\nparticipants in many ways: programs may be carefully placed in specific areas, \nparticipants within those areas may be screened for participation, and the final \ndecision on whether or not to participate is usually voluntary. To the extent that these \nfactors are known and can be measured, they can be controlled for in the empirical \nanalysis, but in most cases the placement of the program and self-selection of \nparticipants in those areas into the program are based on unobservable factors. \nThese unobservable factors lead to at least two kinds of bias in any empirical impact \nevaluation: program placement bias and self-selection bias. \n \nControlling for this bias \u2013 determining the effects of microfinance alone and \nseparating out the impact of microcredit from what would have happened to the same \nhousehold without credit \u2013 is often the most difficult part of empirical impact studies. \nWell-run microfinance institutions do not randomize either the location of their \n 11 \noperations or their selection of clients. If MFIs tend to operate in areas that have \nrelatively better or worse infrastructure such as access by roads or more or less \nactive markets, then estimates of the impacts of the program on participants do not \nmeasure the effects just of microfinance, but of these other factors as well. Even \nwithin a given village, if, as studies by Hashemi (1997), Alexander (2001) and \nColeman (2006) suggest, microfinance clients already have initial advantages over \nnon-clients, then the impact of microfinance will be overestimated if these initial \nbiases are not controlled for. Similarly, the impact of microfinance programs that \ndeliberately target relatively disadvantaged households in the areas they operate \nmay be underestimated if these biases are not controlled for.6  \n \nArmend\u00e1riz de Aghion and Morduch (2005) provide a compelling argument in favor \nof making the substantial investment required to conduct careful impact studies that \ncontrol for these potential biases: \n \nUnfortunately, this is not an esoteric concern that practitioners and \npolicymakers can safely ignore. It is not just a difference between \nobtaining \u201cvery good\u201d estimates of impacts versus \u201cperfect\u201d estimates \n\u2013 the biases can be large. In evaluating the Grameen Bank, for \nexample, Signe-Mary McKernan (2002) finds that not controlling for \nselection bias can lead to overestimation of the effect of participation \non profits by as much as 100 percent. In other cases \u2026controlling for \nthese biases reverses conclusions about impacts entirely. \n \nThere are three broad approaches that have been applied elsewhere in the \nmicrofinance literature. One is the use of a randomized study design to control for \nselection bias (Duflo and Kremer, 2005, World Bank, 2008, McKenzie, 2009). This \napproach eliminates selection bias by randomly selecting treatment (those who \n 12 \nreceive microfinance) and control (those who do not) groups from a potential \npopulation of participants. With this type of study design, the researcher can be \nassured that on average those who are exposed to the program are no different than \nthose who are not and thus that a statistically significant difference between the \ngroups\u201f outcomes can be confidently attributed to the program rather than to \nselection bias.  \n \nThis randomized approach follows that adopted in clinical drugs trials and is seen by \nmany as the best way of rigorously proving impact. A few studies applying this \napproach have been conducted or are ongoing. For example, Banerjee et al (2009) \napply the approach to the expansion of MFIs in slum areas in Hyderabad, India, \nfinding that in the short-term access to microcredit helps business start-up and to \nfund investment. However, it appears to have no impact on social indicators relating \nto female empowerment or family health or education. The qualification is that these \nare short-term effects and through higher investment future monetary and non-\nmonetary benefits may arise. The authors conclude that microfinance can be a useful \nmeans of helping the entrepreneurial poor, but it is not a miracle in the sense of \ntransforming social conditions.  Interestingly, some initial results from randomized \nwork question key tenets of the microfinance literature. For example, a study on Sri \nLanka finds far higher returns to male-headed as opposed to female-headed micro-\nenterprises (de Mel et al., 2008).  \n \nWell-designed randomized studies of this sort have the potential to rigorously \naddress all kinds of potential biases, but their overall \u201cacknowledged weakness is \nexternal validity \u2013 the ability to learn from an evaluation about how the specific \nintervention will work in other settings and at larger scales.\u201d (Ravallion, 2009: 3) One \nlimitation of small-scale randomized social experiments is that they can only estimate \npartial equilibrium treatment effects, which may differ from general equilibrium \n 13 \ntreatment effects. In the case of microfinance, this means that if, for example, \nmicrofinance is introduced on a large scale, the functioning of financial markets may \neventually be affected, thus yielding a different impact than the necessarily smaller-\nscale program introduced for the impact study. There is also the potential for \nspillovers that create external benefits, for example from treated villages or areas \nwhere microfinance operates to untreated ones it has yet to reach. There is thus the \npossibility that non-program participants may benefit indirectly from the gains of \nparticipants which will distort the impact assessment. The biggest problem for \nexternal validity of randomized studies is related to the issue of unobservable \ncharacteristics that affect both program placement and self-selection. A randomized \nstudy will include in the treatment group individuals with and without these \nunobservable characteristics to get a truly unbiased measure of impact. But when \ninterventions such as microfinance are introduced on a large scale, the participants  \ntend to have those characteristics. Thus, despite their scientific appeal, randomized \nstudies are not always the most relevant for policy makers. (Ravallion, 2009 :.2). \n \nAnother, more practical, concern in attempting to apply randomized study design is \nthat such studies require tremendous cooperation from the institutions being \nevaluated, which must be willing to allow researchers to randomize the \nimplementation of their services. Such studies are preferably longitudinal, making \nthem costly, and it can be difficult to conduct research over a period long enough for \nsome impacts to show up. Intellectual arguments aside, for these practical reasons \nthe randomization approach was not applied in this study. \n \nA simpler alternative is to identify a control group through some identifiable eligibility \nattribute. A well known study by Pitt and Khandker (1998) used land ownership. The \nauthors sample participants and non-participants of microfinance programs in a \nnumber of treatment villages where group lending programs are operating as well as \n 14 \nrandomly selected households from control villages without a program. They use \nvillage fixed effects to correct for the endogeneity of program placement and take \nadvantage of the fact that the microcredit programs impose eligibility requirements on \nparticipants (households with land holdings of more than half an acre are ineligible) \nto determine eligible and ineligible households in the control villages. Impact is \nassessed using a difference-in-difference approach between eligible and ineligible \nhouseholds and between program and non-program villages. After controlling for \nother factors, such as various household characteristics, any remaining difference is \nattributed to the microfinance programs. The difficulty with this approach is that clear \neligibility criteria for access to microfinance need to be identifiable and strictly \napplied.7  \n \nAnother approach to controlling for self-selection and placement bias is to include a \nsample of microcredit clients who have formed solidarity groups but have not yet \nreceived loans as the control group (Hulme and Mosley, 1996, Coleman, 1999 and \n2006). In this approach, participating and non-participating households are again \nsurveyed in treatment villages where the microcredit program is already operating \nand has already given loans. The controls are villages where the microcredit program \nwill operate and households from the village which have already self-selected to \nparticipate in the program but have not yet actually received loans. \n \nHulme and Mosley (1996) employed this approach in their major study of programs in \na number of countries. However, arguably their study fails to control for the major \nsource of bias \u2013 program placement bias \u2013 so part of the advantage of program \nparticipants relative to the control group may be due to unmeasured village attributes \nthat affect both the supply and demand for credit. Using the same basic approach, \nColeman (1999), addressed the placement bias issue by introducing observable \nvillage characteristics and village dummies in his study of a village banking program \n 15 \nin Thailand. Utilizing data on 455 households, including participating and non-\nparticipating households in treatment villages where a village bank is already offering \nmicrocredit, and selected future participants and non-participants in control villages \nthat have been identified to receive a village bank program but have not yet actually \nreceived funds, Coleman (1999) uses a difference-in-difference approach that \ncompares the difference between income for participants and non-participants in \nprogram villages with the same difference in the control villages, where the programs \nwere introduced later. The rationale is that the unobservable characteristics of bank \nmembers (such as entrepreneurial drive) will be shared by members who have taken \nout a loan and those who have applied but not yet received their loan. Then if other \nmeasurable household and village characteristics can be controlled for the remaining \ndifference can be attributed to the receipt of the microcredit. Chowdhury et al (2005) \nused a similar approach in an analysis of Bangladesh. \n \nThe nature of the Khushhali Bank\u201fs operations lent itself to an impact assessment \nusing the latter approach, of taking clients who had not yet accessed loans as the \ncontrol group.  In 2005 the bank was expanding rapidly into new villages and the \nnumber of active clients was increasing at a rate of approximately 20,000 clients \nevery 3 months. These were mostly rural areas of Pakistan in which there were \npreviously no formal financial services provided. Bank management and staff were \nwilling to cooperate with surveyors in identifying new villages that had just received \nthe service and within those villages identifying new clients, allowing them to be \nsurveyed in the interim between their application and the approval to get a microloan \nand the actual disbursement of the money.  \n \nConcerns about this approach to impact study design center around program \nplacement, selection, wealth effects and attrition bias. Each of these is addressed in \nour study design. From discussions with bank management, the sequence in which \n 16 \nthe bank moved into villages did not appear to be driven systematically by an \neconomic rationale, so that there is no deliberate attempt to provide services first to \nvillages with an advantageous (or disadvantageous) location due either to climate, \ngeography or infrastructure links. Hence \u201cplacement bias\u201d did not appear to be a \nfactor. However, as a check, village dummies are included in the regression models \nto account for unobserved village effects8.  Selection criteria of the bank was under \nreview, but no changes had been implemented at the time of the survey and since \nthe control group of members who had not yet borrowed was drawn from villages just \nreceiving the service, there is no reason to think that the self-selection criteria on the \npart of clients changed systematically over time, either. Thus, we have no reason to \nthink the latent characteristics of our control group of borrowers are fundamentally \ndifferent from those of the treatment group. However, significant for the external \nvalidity of this study, we do admit that these unobservable characteristics in both the \ntreatment and control group of bank members may differ from the non-member \npopulation at large. There was only a short time period - typically just a few weeks - \nbetween loan approval and disbursement and the survey was carried out during that \nbrief interval. Thus, while we recognize that a wealth effect \u2013 the fact that notification \nof approval for a loan may lead to increased household consumption even before \nactual receipt of the loan - may bias downward any impact findings using this \napproach, the short time period in question should limit this effect. Also, overall, there \nis no significant relationship between bank membership and aggregate expenditure, \nwhich also suggests that a wealth effect may not present any serious problems in \ninterpreting the results. Attrition bias \u2013 the fact that the control group of approved \nfuture borrowers includes potential future dropouts or graduates of the program, \nwhereas the treatment group of older borrowers, who have remained active, may not \n(Karlan, 2001)9 - can be ruled out here since the sample of clients analyzed here is \nunusual in that it included clients from not only active groups, but also from groups \nthat were in default, currently inactive for other reasons, or had completely dropped-\n 17 \nout of the program.10 Hence, whilst the control group of future borrowers contains \npotential drop-outs and defaulters, so does the treatment group, eliminating attrition \nbias.  \n \nIn summary, at the time of survey the Khushhali Bank was expanding rapidly into \nnew areas with many new members who had self-selected to join the Bank, but not \nyet taken out a loan. These circumstances provided a natural experiment in the form \nof a control group for whom outcomes could be compared with members who had \nalready taken out and spent a Khushhali loan. Whilst the approach involves some \nimplicit assumptions, for example on the absence of a wealth effect and on the \nunchanging nature of the unobservable characteristics of the treatment and control \ngroups, the short time periods involved lessen their significance, thus allowing a \nrelatively simple and practical means of assessing impact. \n \n \n \n \nIV. Data and Regression Framework \n \nTo conduct the empirical analysis, primary data was collected from 2,881 households \n\u2013 more than any other rigorous impact study on microfinance to date.  A stratified \nrandom sample of 1,454 Khushhali Bank clients and future clients was drawn from \n139 rural villages and 3 urban cities where the bank operates. A roughly equal \nnumber (1,427) of randomly selected non-clients from the same villages or \nsettlements were also surveyed. The survey covered 11 districts across all provinces \nin Pakistan, including Kashmir.   \n \n 18 \nAt the time the sample was drawn, the bank was operating in approximately 42 \ndistricts in Pakistan and had about 175,000 active clients, 37,000 of which were in \nthe 11 districts finally sampled.  Thus, the sample represented more than a quarter of \nthe districts served by the bank and about 4% of the clients in the selected districts, \nbut less than 1% of the total number of clients at that time.  Roughly 40% of the \nsample of client households were female clients, meaning that the female in the \nhousehold  was the Khushhali Bank program member. This slightly over-represents \nfemale clients in the sample since at the time of the survey roughly 30% of Khushhali \nclients were women. But the advantage to this slight oversampling is that it may yield \nmore robust estimates of gender issues \u2013 an important policy question for poverty \nreduction in Pakistan - in the empirical analysis.   \n \nOne quarter (732, or 25%) of the total sample, were from urban areas.  At the time of \nsampling, roughly 35% of the surveyed areas and approximately 15% of the total \npopulation of clients at that time were from urban areas.  Loans for micro-enterprises \nwere roughly one-third of the total, with the remainder divided between livestock \nrearing and arable farming, with some overlap between these two categories. In each \nhousehold, both the male and female head of household were interviewed separately \n(regardless of the gender of the borrower). Thus, data collection involved nearly \n6,000 individual surveys. As stated above, client households surveyed, both \nborrowers and those who had not yet borrowed, were predominantly poor: 70% were \nliving below the poverty line. Average household consumption expenditure per capita \nin the sample (including expenditure on food, consumer durables, heating, rent, \ntransport, health and education) was less than $40 per month in nominal terms (see \nTable 1) and average years of education for the most well educated household \nmember was less than six years for males and less than two and a half years for \nfemales (see Table 2). The Appendix gives more details on survey design and \nimplementation.  \n 19 \nInsert Table 1 \n \nInsert table 2 \n \nAs described above, the methodology involves a form of difference-in-difference \nanalysis comparing members of the bank and non-members and, within the group of \nmembers, borrowers and non-borrowers. Two sets of villages are compared \u2013 those \nwhere the Khushalli bank has already been in operation and those where it has \ndecided to operate but not yet commenced lending. Within these villages two sets of \nhouseholds are compared, those who are not members of the bank and those who \nare. Members in the \u201cold\u201d villages where the bank is already in operation will have \ntaken out loans (and hence are borrowers), whilst members in the \u201cnew\u201d villages, \nwhere bank operations have not yet commenced will have been approved for a loan, \nbut not yet received it (hence they are members but still non-borrowers). Members \nare assumed to share unobservable characteristics that will influence outcomes in \nthe absence of microcredit. However, by separating those members who have \nreceived a loan from those who have not, and controlling for household \ncharacteristics (like age, education, literacy, family size and so forth) and village fixed \neffects, the impact of microcredit alone on various outcome indicators can be \nisolated. \n \nFollowing this approach, the control group for existing borrowers is members in new \nvillages, who have not yet actually received their loan, but who are taken to share the \nunobservable characteristics of current borrowers. Impact is estimated with a single \nequation: \n \nijijijijjijij TMMVXY \uf065\uf062\uf062\uf062\uf062 \uf02b\uf02a\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d 4321                                                            (1) \n 20 \n \nwhere Yij, is a vector of impact or outcome variables, Xij is a vector of household \ncharacteristics, Vj represents village fixed effects, which control for observable and \nunobservable variables that may influence program placement, Mij is a membership \ndummy variable equal to 1 for any household that is a member of the bank and thus \nable to borrow under the program and Tij is a dummy variable for treatment, which \nreflects bank members who have already received a loan.   \n \nThus, Tij takes a value of 1 for borrower households, who have already taken out a \nloan, either currently or in the past. This excludes the control group of new bank \nmembers who have applied for and been approved to receive a loan, but have not \nyet received the funds (for those households Tij is zero). The \u201ctreatment\u201d group of \nbank member households who have already participated in the program would have \nreceived their loan sometime between one and five years ago. The most recent \nentrants to the treatment group would have received their loans one year from the \nsurvey date and successful clients would therefore have fully repaid the loan. The \noldest borrowers in the treatment group would have received their first loan as long \nas five years before the survey date, when the bank opened its first branches.  Tij \ndoes not capture the degree of borrowing, so clients who borrowed the smallest loan \nsize only once (and perhaps dropped out after that) are included in the treatment \ngroup in the same way as clients who joined the program five years earlier and who \ntook and successfully repaid several loan cycles. This aggregation of borrowers does \nnot inform us of the incremental impacts of borrowing \u2013 how much more impact \ncomes from another loan cycle or a larger loan \u2013 but since unobservable factors that \ninfluence the degree of a client\u201fs participation are also likely to influence the outcome \nvariables of interest, measuring treatment with simple participation rather than the \ndegree of participation provides the preferred estimate of impact purely from the \nmicro-lending.. \n 21 \n \nThe hypothesis tested is whether access to the microfinance program of the \nKhushhali Bank has a positive effect on the various outcome measures of welfare \ndescribed above.  Support for the hypothesis requires that the estimated coefficient \n\uf0624 on the interaction term M*T in equation (1) is statistically significant (and, in most \ncases, positive).  \n \nIn terms of outcome variables under vector Y our concern is to test for the \ncontribution of microfinance to a broad set of indicators that roughly correspond to \nthe millennium development goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger (MDG \n1), achieving universal primary education (MDG 2), promoting gender equality and \nempowering women (MDG 3) and reducing child mortality (MDG 4).  This broad \nagenda also corresponds to the goals set by the government of Pakistan for the \nbank. To this end we test for the program\u201fs impact on income variables, \nconsumption-expenditure variables, education variables, variables reflecting aspects \nof gender empowerment and health \u2013 especially child health -  variables .  \n \nTable 1 presents summary statistics on the dependent variables in vector Y.  Income \nvariables measured include the sales and profits reported for the household\u201fs income \ngenerating activities: microenterprise, livestock raising or other agricultural activities. \nThe consumption-expenditure variables include food consumption, which is the basis \nfor calculating the official poverty line in Pakistan, and thus perhaps the most direct \nindicator of the program\u201fs impact on poverty. Note that the poverty measure is thus \nan objective indicator. The survey did not attempt to ascertain subjective or \nperception measures of poverty from respondents. Educational objectives were \nmeasured by the probability of school age children being enrolled in school and \nabsenteeism from school. Including measures of gender empowerment is unusual in \na quantitative study of this type. The measures are derived from yes\/no answers to \n 22 \nquestions on whether the woman\u201fs opinion is taken into account in a series of \nhousehold decisions ranging from children\u201fs schooling, their work outside the home, \nuse of contraception to the economic activity of the family. Health impacts are \nmeasured by the probability of household members \u2013 adults and children - receiving \ntreatment for illnesses and the quality of the treatment, as measured by the training \nof the provider. The survey also collected information on whether children in the \nhousehold were vaccinated and received treatment (ORS) for diarrheal disease, \nwhich kills more than 50,000 children under the age of five in Pakistan each year \n(UNICEF-WHO, 2009 :15).   \n \nTable 2 sets out the summary statistics on the set of household characteristics used \nunder vector X in equation (1).   \n \nFor most of the empirical analysis, ordinary least squares analysis (OLS) was \napplied.  Regressions in which the outcome variable of interest was a yes\/no dummy \nvariable on qualitative information, logit estimation techniques were used. In addition \nto the aggregate results on the entire sample, heterogeneity is explored by splitting \nthe sample into urban and rural households and exploring differential effects on \nhouseholds in which the borrower was the male or female head of household. Given \nthe potential for the very poor or core poor to be left behind by microfinance, \nparticularly where, as in this case, commercial interest rates are charged, we also \ntest for whether the relationship between access to funds and the various outcome \nindicators differs for borrowers in the bottom quintile as compared with the sample \naverage. \n \nV.  Results \n \n 23 \nMonetary indicators \n \nThe first millennium development goal is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, \nwith some of the specific targets being to reduce the proportion of the population \nliving on less than $1 a day and increasing the proportion of own-account and \ncontributing family workers in total employment. The immediate objective of most \nmicro-lending -  to provide a source of financial intermediation for micro-enterprise \nand small farmers \u2013 is perhaps most directly related to these targets. Thus, we begin \nour discussion with the program\u201fs impact on monetary indicators of welfare.  \n \nTable 3a reports the impact of program participation on sales or profits of the income \ngenerating activity run by the household \u2013 livestock\/animal raising, arable agricultural \nactivities or micro-enterprise. For the full sample the impact of borrowing under the \nprogram is not evident in either sales or profits from livestock\/animal raising activities \nor for arable farming. At the time the sample was drawn, around two-thirds of loans \nwere for this type of activity. Neither is it evident for the sales or profits of \nmicroenterprises. Additional variables on number of loan cycles, size of loans and \nnumber of months since taking a loan \u2013 not reported here - are also insignificant in \nmost cases. This result suggests no income effect from taking out loans.  \n \n Insert Table 3a \n \nInsert Table 3b \n \nInsert Table 3c \n \n 24 \nIn addition to the analysis of income effects above, the impact on expenditure of \ndrawing on Khushhali bank loans is also examined. The results for four separate \nexpenditure variables are reported in table 4a. The first outcome variable, monthly \nconsumption per capita, looks at the impact of the program on caloric consumption \nas measured by consumption-expenditure on food items. The items used in \ncalculating this variable correspond as closely as possible to the items used by the \ngovernment of Pakistan in calculating the official poverty line. Separately, three other \nexpenditure outcome variables are used; monthly per capita consumption of non-\nfood items (heating, household durables, clothing, transport and so forth), monthly \nper capita expenditure on health care and annual educational expenditure per child in \nthe household.  \n  \n Insert Table 4a \n \nInsert Table 4b \n \nInsert table 4c \n \nIn general, there is no evidence of a quantitatively significant impact of program \nparticipation on poverty as indicated by consumption-expenditure. There is no \nstatistically significant relationship between program participation (M*T, or \n\u201ctreatment\u201d, in equation 1) and aggregate consumption expenditure on either food or \nnon-food expenditures. Participation in the program also has no statistically \nsignificant influence on household educational expenditures per child. Not \nsurprisingly, educational expenditures per child are determined principally by the \neducation level of the highest-educated male and female in the household.  \nNonetheless in one specific area there is evidence that borrowing under the program \nhas had an impact on expenditure. Table 4a reports a positive impact on health \n 25 \nexpenditures, as indicated by the statistically significant positive coefficient estimate \nin column 3.  Relative to the control group households borrowing under the program \ntend to have on average Rs 41 per month higher per capita expenditures on health \ncare. Although this is small in absolute terms, since the bank\u201fs program does nothing \nexplicit to encourage health awareness per se (and loans are supposed to be used \nfor investment purposes), this suggests that poor households either prefer to or need \nto use any extra income generated by micro-credit on health care rather than on \neducation or food consumption.  \n \nThese results indicate a clear lack of impact of borrowing on income and most \naspects of expenditure. The survey distinguishes between households (in both \ntreatment and control groups) in rural and urban locations (on the basis of the \nlocation of the Khushhali bank offices) with about one quarter of borrowers from \nurban areas and the remainder from rural. Since borrowers may face different \nconstraints and use the loans in different ways in rural and urban settings, the \nanalysis sub-divides the sample into urban and rural households. Tables 3b and 3c \nreport the urban and rural results respectively for income generating activities and \ntables 4b and 4c do the same for expenditure. In the analysis of sales and \nprofits,there is very little change with the exception that there is statistically weak (at \nthe 10% level) positive effect of taking out a loan on the sales of urban micro-\nenterprises (table 3b column 4). On the expenditure side, however, there is one \nsignificant notable effect, which is that in rural areas, taking out a loan is positively \nassociated with higher food expenditure (table 4c, column 1). In contrast, the positive \nimpact on household health expenditure found in the full sample does not show up in \nthe analysis of the rural and urban sub-samples. \n \nThese results are disappointing for those seeking evidence of a positive impact of \nlending by the Khushhali bank on household income. There is little evidence of a \n 26 \ndirect impact on income generation, the main intention of the bank. Considering \nbroader monetary indicators, positive impacts are found for health and food \nexpenditures, although the former result is not robust and the latter applies only to \nrural areas. These results may trouble purists who hold that microfinance should be  \ngranted for investment purposes only, not for consumption smoothing to meet short-\nterm household expenditures on food and health. A more flexible view of the role of \nmicrofinance would allow these expenditures to be considered as part of household \nfinancial planning where fungible resources are allocated in line with household \nneeds.  \n \nSocial Indicators \n \nExpenditure-based poverty measures can omit important non-monetary dimensions \nof welfare, as reflected in the millennium development goals to achieve universal \nprimary education, empower women and reduce child mortality. Tables 5 and 6 look \nat the impact of microcredit on non-monetary social indicators relating to education, \nhealth and female empowerment.  \n \nTurning first to table 5, there is little evidence of a positive impact of the program \noverall on education, Although children in Khushhali Bank member households are \nmore likely to be enrolled in school than children in non-member households, \nchildren in households already participating by taking out loans are no more likely to \nbe enrolled in school and have the same rates of absenteeism as children in \nhouseholds that are members of the bank but have not yet taken out loans.   \n \n Insert Table 5 \n \n 27 \nFor health indicators, however, in line with the expenditure results there is evidence \nthat households already participating in the program are more likely to get medical \ntreatment for their children\u201fs illnesses, and that the treatment is more likely to come \nfrom a trained medical professional, as compared with non-borrowing members (see \ntable 5 columns 6 and 7). The odds ratios from the logit regressions suggest that \nborrowing households are about one and a half times more likely to seek medical \ntreatment when their children are ill. Of those households who seek treatment for \ntheir children\u201fs illnesses, participating households are one and a half times more \nlikely than a not yet borrowing household to turn to a trained medical professional for \nthat treatment.   \n \nAs with the analysis of the monetary indicators, the sample is further divided by \nurban and rural households. The positive impact of the program on health indicators \nseems to be primarily enjoyed by rural households. For urban households no \nsignificant results are obtained for the key education and health indicators, whilst for \nrural households the results from the general sample on the greater probability of \nseeking medical treatment for children and on the use of a trained health professional \nassociated with taking out a loan are confirmed.11  \n \nFemale empowerment \n \nAn important aspect of the study design is to test whether borrowing under the \nprogram has an impact on female empowerment, as gauged through responses to \nquestions on female involvement in family decision-making, political activity and work \noutside the home. The survey asks married females between the ages of 15-40 to \ngrade answers to questions on their involvement in the various family decisions on a \nscale of 1 to 6 ranging from \u201ealways\u201f to \u201enever\u201f and answers are grouped into yes\/no \ncategories to allow the application of logit analysis. In analyzing female \n 28 \nempowerment, we explore heterogeneity in the sample across households in which \nthe bank member and borrower was male or female. These results are reported in \ntable 6. \n \n Insert Table 6 \n \nTable 6 confirms that, as expected, female Khushhali bank members are already \nmore empowered than non-members, as evidenced by the highly significant positive \nparameter estimates on the coefficient estimates on a \u201cFemale Khushhali Bank \nclient\u201d dummy in specifications looking at the role of females in decisions on number \nof children, repair of property and borrowing money. However, unexpectedly, wives \nof male bank members tend to be less empowered than women in non-member \nhouseholds in a few areas \u2013 the decision on number of children and on property \nrepair - as evidenced by the significant negative coefficient on the variable \u201cKhushhali \nBank client\u201d. After member households actually receive a loan, the wives of male \nbank clients report being more empowered in several areas (see the significantly \npositive coefficients on the variable \u201cAccessed Loans\u201d), and these positive effects \noutweigh the negative bias that apparently exists in member households. Thus \noverall, accessing a loan does appear to make a difference to the sense of \nempowerment: the negative coefficients on Khushhali Bank client in table 6 columns \n3 and 4 are smaller and less significantly significant than the positive coefficients on \nthe variable Accessed Loans. Female borrowers, however, do not report any major \nimprovement in their sense of empowerment after taking out a loan. In most \ninstances the interaction term between a female client and accessing loans is \ninsignificant.12 This lack of impact on empowerment for female borrowers as opposed \nto the wives of male borrowers may be due to their higher initial empowerment.  \nExploring heterogeneity in the sample, it again appears that rural households are \ndriving the overall results (results for the urban and rural sub-sample, respectively \n 29 \nare not re[ported but are available from the authors). Urban households do not report \nmuch impact of program participation on female empowerment, with the exception of \nfemale borrowers, who report that accessing loans brings with it significantly more \ninfluence in household decisions as to whether or not to borrow money.  \n \n These results are interesting and may merit further examination since they counter \nconclusions of some earlier studies, which found that even when borrowers are \nwomen, they do not necessarily exert influence over key family decisions.13 The \nresults here suggest that access to microfinance empowers women in the household, \neven if the woman herself is not the borrower.  \n \nImpact on the core poor \n \nThe millennium development goals are particularly concerned with the poorest \nquintile of the population \u2013 the core poor. But a common argument in the debate on \ncommercially-oriented microfinance is that it cannot reach the core poor either \nbecause they are excluded by social networks or because they are too risk averse to \nparticipate to the same degree as other borrowers. To inform this debate, we look for \nheterogeneous impacts of the program on particularly poor households by \nintroducing a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 for households in the bottom \nquintile of consumption-expenditure for the sample. This dummy is interacted with \nM*T in equation (1) and the interaction term is introduced as an additional \nexplanatory variable.  \n \nThe results are reported in tables 7 and 8 for the analysis of expenditure-\nconsumption and education and health impacts, respectively. Table 7 reports that, as \nexpected, the expenditure of this group of core poor is significantly lower for three out \nof the four (all except health care!) measures of expenditure.   Including the \n 30 \ninteraction term for the bottom quintile indicates no statistically significant differences \nin impact of borrowing to this group of very poor borrowers for expenditure, with the \nexception that borrowing under the program has a statistically weak positive impact \non educational expenditures per child for the very poor. It should be noted this is a \ndifferential effect relative to non-core borrowers and is not strong enough to offset the \ndisadvantage the core poor have due to their lower income.  \n \nInsert Table 7 \n \nInsert Table 8 \n \nIn relation to the education and health variables, as expected, the poorest \nhouseholds are less likely than the average to have their children enrolled in school \nor to have them vaccinated. However for the core poor who borrow under the \nprogram there is a positive effect on both of these probabilities that more than offsets \nthis disadvantage. Table 8 shows that for columns  1 and 7 where the core poor \naccess loans there is a significant positive coefficient estimate on the interaction \nbetween the core poor dummy and loan access, which is highly statistically \nsignificant and quantitatively larger than the negative coefficient estimates on the \ncore poor dummy.  Borrowing under the program also statistically significantly \nincreases the probability that children in core poor households receive ORS \ntreatment for diarrheal disease, a significant killer of children under 5 in Pakistan.  \n \nThere is no evidence that for income generating activities in livestock rearing, arable \nfarming or micro-enterprises there is any differential effect between core-poor \nborrowers and other borrowers.14 Thus we find no evidence the very poor borrowers \nare differentially affected in any major way relative to better-off borrowers in terms of \nmonetary measures and access to loans appears to help in terms of their educational \n 31 \nand health status. This result challenges the applicability of some earlier research \nfindings - where it has been found that it is the better-off poor who have most to gain \nfrom microfinance15\u2013 to the case of Pakistan.   \n \n \nVI. Conclusions  \n \nThe form of microfinance practiced by the Khushhali bank involves small loans \noffered over short periods and at interest rates that are high relative to those in the \nformal banking sector. It is a clear example of second generation microfinance \ninstitutions that aim for financial sustainability to avoid reliance on donor funding. A \nkey policy question is how far this commercial orientation dilutes the poverty reducing \nand welfare improving goals that are associated with the microfinance movement.  \nThis study addresses this issue empirically by linking the bank\u201fs lending activity with \nprogress on a range of indicators that are consistent with progress towards the \nMDGs that form the center-piece of the government\u201fs poverty reduction strategy.  \n \nThe empirical analysis here provides little evidence that access to the Khushhali \nBank\u201fs microcredit program has had positive impacts on monetary measures of \nwelfare on aggregate, although there is evidence that rural households participating \nin the program have higher food expenditure.  However there is no impact on \nmeasures of income generating activities, either external sales or profits, for \nmicroenterprises or agricultural activities.  \n \nIn relation to non-monetary measures, access to loans does appear associated with \na higher probability of medical treatment for children in the household and a higher \nprobability that the provider of that treatment is trained. This appears to be an explicit \n 32 \nhousehold choice not influenced by training or advice associated with the loan, but \none which is clearly in line with the Millennium Development Goal to reduce child \nmortality.  \n \nIn terms of family dynamics, wives of male bank members who take out loans report \ngreater empowerment in family decisions than wives of members who have not yet \ntaken out a loan. The Millennium Development Goal to promote gender equality and \nfemale empowerment is particularly important in South Asia and this is evidence that \nmicrofinance in Pakistan is contributing towards this goal.   \n \nFor the very poorest households \u2013 those in the bottom quintile of the sample, or at \nless than half the official poverty line \u2013 there is no special impact on monetary \nindicators, but there is evidence that the poorest households share in the \nimprovements in children\u201fs health care and even get some extra impacts. Amongst \nthe very poor, borrowing increases the likelihood that children in the household are \nvaccinated and receive treatment (ORS) for diarrheal disease, a major killer of \nchildren under five in Pakistan. It also brings educational benefits, since the poorest \nborrowers report higher than expected educational expenditures per child and higher \nrates of children\u201fs enrollment in school. Here the loan or any additional income it \ncreates appears to allow the poorest households to invest in children\u201fs health and \neducation, again helping towards important MDG targets.   \n \nOverall, we find no evidence that at the time of the survey the Khushhali bank has \nmade much progress towards the goal of stimulating self-sustaining household \nincome growth through either urban microenterprises or rural agricultural activities. \nThese results are of concern for all who view the goal of microfinance as stimulating \nsmall scale income-generating activity. The survey was conducted in 2005 only five \n 33 \nyears after the first loans were made and it is possible that cumulative income effects \nmay build up over time through frequent repeat borrowing and repayment. \n \nHowever, we do find evidence that \u2013 at least in rural areas \u2013 the bank is contributing \nto the achievement of some of the MDGs by reducing poverty, empowering women \nand improving the health of children. The poorest households are also making \nprogress on the goal of achieving universal primary education. Thus, these findings \nsuggest that, given a supportive regulatory environment, it is possible for \ncommercially-oriented microfinance banks to meet a \u201cdouble bottom line\u201d of \nsimultaneously pursuing profits and a social mission to promote development.  \n \n 34 \nAppendix : Details of Data Collection \n \n \nDesign of the survey followed international guidelines, in particular those laid out in \nthe three volume series by Grosh and Glewwe (2000) on the Living Standards and \nMeasurement Survey (LSMS).  Full details of the questionnaire are in Montgomery \n(2005). \n \ni. Survey Instrument \u2013 Questionnaire \n \nDesign of the survey instrument, the questionnaire to be used in gathering data for \nthe study, was primarily guided by the research question: what has been the impact \nof the microfinance program on household welfare?  It was decided to include a \nrelatively wide definition of welfare that includes non-economic measures of welfare \nsuch as education, health or empowerment.  \n \nCore components of the LSMS were incorporated, and the final questionnaire also \ndrew upon the AIMS-SEEP Impact Survey Tools (Assessing the Impacts of \nMicroenterprise Services - Small Enterprise Education and Promotion Network ), \nimpact assessment tools designed specifically for assessment of microfinance \ninstitutions, as well as several carefully designed questionnaires used in previous \nstudies in Pakistan.  The findings of a nationwide participatory poverty assessment \n(Government of Pakistan (2004)) were also consulted and results of focus group \ndiscussions with Khushhali Bank clients were incorporated.   \n \nLength of the questionnaire was limited to what could be reasonably delivered in a \nmaximum of one hour if all components were asked.  In the final administration, most \nquestionnaires took substantially less than one hour since very few households \nwould actually respond to all sections.  The sequence of the questionnaire was \n 35 \nguided by the LSMS, and accordingly sensitive questions on finances or \nempowerment issues were administered last.   \n \nTo increase the accuracy of the information gathered and to enable the survey to \naddress gender issues such as empowerment, both the male and female head of \nhousehold were interviewed separately for each household.  The suitability of \ndifferent components of the questionnaire for the male or female version was decided \nbased on the previous questionnaires listed above and confirmed in pre-testing.  \nThe questionnaire was prepared simultaneously in English and Urdu and then \ntranslated into two regional languages: Pushto and Sindhi.  Accuracy of the \ntranslations was checked by back translation into the original language.   \n \nii. Implementation \n \nThe survey was pre-tested on both client and non-client households and the final \nsurvey was implemented over an 8 week period after a major harvest when there \nwould be many new villages and clients just getting access to Khushhali Bank \nservices for the first time, making it easier to collect data on a suitable control group.   \n \nThe survey was carried out by an independent multinational survey company.  Male \nsurveys were conducted by male surveyors and female surveys by female surveyors.  \nSurveyors and supervisors for each team were recruited from local areas and \ninterviews were conducted in local languages.  Since many of the surveyors were \nnew, one week of classroom training on administration of surveys, and field testing of \nthe surveyors\u201f skill in both rural and urban areas were conducted.  Extra surveyors \nwere trained in the event that any surveyor had to be replaced during the training, \nfield-testing, or once the survey was underway, but that was not necessary.   \n \n 36 \niii. Quality Control \n \nSurvey teams spent 3-4 days in each village included in the survey to allow time for \nthe team supervisor to edit all completed questionnaires and back-check 15% of the \nfieldwork.  If any problems were discovered during back-checking, then 100% of that \nindividual surveyors work was checked.  An independent quality control department \nsimilarly carried out back-checking of each supervisors work.  Data processing was \nnot able to be conducted on-site due to cost considerations, and was instead done \non edited questionnaires in a centralized location.  A data program was designed to \nautomatically check the consistency of answers and in addition 10% of the data entry \nand coding was randomly back-checked.   \n 37 \nTable 1: Summary Statistics - Dependent Variables \n \nVariable Label     Obs Mean Std.Dev.

In \n2009, there were problems in the sector with one MFI failing and the extent of \noutreach shrinking. \n \n3 See Haq (2008); this estimate is higher than the operational self-sufficiency ratios \nfor other MFIs in Pakistan. \n \n4 The official poverty line is based on caloric intake and translates into approximately \n1,000 rupees per capita per month of food consumption.  Very rough calculations \nindicate that this level of caloric consumption corresponds to about 87 cents per day \non total consumption.  The authors thank Talat Anwar for raising this issue and \nproviding an updated poverty line estimate. \n \n5 This is a range of $50 -$500 at the exchange rate of approximately R60\/US dollar \nprevailing in mid 2005. \n \n 51 \n                                                                                                                                            \n6 In Pakistan, Zafar and Abid (1999) is an example of a qualitative approach to \nmicrofinance impact using focus groups and survey data from 55 households with no \ncontrol group identified. \n \n7 Morduch (1999: 1605) pointed out that the eligibility criterion of low land holdings \nwas not strictly enforced in practice. In a reworking of the results focusing on more \ndirectly comparable households, he found no impact on consumption from \nparticipation. The most recent critique of the original analysis and re-working of the \ndata is Roodman and Morduch (2009).  \n \n8 An F test that coefficient estimates on all village dummies are jointly insignificant is \nrejected at the 1% confidence level for many of the specifications, but re-running the \nregressions without village dummies yielded no qualitative difference in the results. \nThe basic results in the model without the village dummies are not reported but are \navailable from the authors.  \n \n9 Coleman (1999) does not in fact does not suffer from this problem. \n \n10 706, or roughly half of the treatment group, were currently active clients: 13% were \ninactive, 18% were members of a group where at least one in the group was in \ndefault - thus making all members ineligible to receive loans - and 16% had dropped \nout of the program. \n \n11 To avoid excessive detail these results are not given but are available from the \nauthors.  \n \n 52 \n                                                                                                                                            \n12 Where is it weakly significant (in the case of child-rearing decisions) it has an \nunexpected negative sign. \n \n13 See Goetz and Gupta (1996) for an interpretation along these lines for the use of \nmicrocredit in Bangladesh. \n \n14 The results for these income generating activities are not reported here but further \ndetails of this aspect of the study are in Montgomery (2006). It should be noted that \nin the study design the bottom quintile had to be identified ex post rather than ex ante \nin relation to program participation. This means that there is the possibility of bias \nwhere the program itself influenced who was in the bottom quintile. Given the way in \nwhich the study was organized it is not possible to control for this so that the results \nfrom this part of the analysis should be interpreted with some caution. However the \nfact that overall there seems to have been no participation effect on total or income \nconsumption weakens the risk of this bias.   \n \n15 See the surveys of Meyer (2002), Montgomery and Weiss (2005), Goldberg (2007) \nand Karlan and Murdoch (2010). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 53 \n                                                                                                                                            \nReferences  \n \nAlexander, Gwen (2001). \u201cAn Empirical Analysis of Microfinance: Who are the \nclients?\u201d  Paper presented at 2001 Northeastern Universities Development \nConsortium Conference. \n \nArif, G.M.
