Such a device uses a magnetic\ncontact to electrically inject spin polarized carriers into a\nLED structure and employs the radiative selection rules to\nrelate the degree of the circular polarization of the emitted\nlight to the injected carrier spin polarization. Ferromagnetic\nmetals are attractive as magnetic contacts in spin-LEDs due\nto their high Curie temperatures and their well-studied struc-\ntural and magnetic properties. Recently, high spin injection\nefficiencies have been achieved in devices where a conven-\ntional ferromagnetic metal such as Fe, Co, Ni and their al-\nloys were used to electrically inject spin-polarized electrons\nvia a Schottky3\u20135 or an oxide tunnel barrier6\u20139 into a semi-\nconductor LED structure.\nIn the great majority of these devices, bulk semiconduc-\ntors or quantum wells have been used as the recombination\nregion. Spin relaxation in these is mainly caused by\nmomentum\u2013dependent spin interactions that are in general\nfast because of the availability of a continuum of energy\nstates. These mechanisms should be inefficient in spin-LEDs\nbased on quantum dots \u0001QDs\u0002 due to their three-dimensional\ncarrier confinement, which results in a discrete density of\nstates. Yet, there have been few reports on electrical spin\ninjection in QD-based spin-LEDs,10\u201312 only one of which12\nused a ferromagnetic contact as injector. In the latter, a large\nmagnetic field \u0001B\u00012 T\u0002 was used to bring the Fe film mag-\nnetization out of plane \u0001hard axis\u0002 and inject electrons with\nspins along the surface normal \u0001Faraday geometry\u0002. An in-\njected spin polarization in the QDs, Pspin of 5% was mea-\nsured; importantly the polarization was insensitive to the\ntemperature and persisted to 300 K, confirming the potential\nof quantum dots as spin detectors in spin-LEDs.\nWe demonstrate here electrical spin injection from ferro-\nmagnetic Fe contacts into semiconductor LED structures\ncontaining single layers of InAs\/GaAs self-assembled quan-\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\ng.itskos@imperial.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/88\u00022\u0001\/022113\/3\/$23.00 88, 02211\nDownloaded 03 Jun 2009 to 131.227.178.130.

A 1000 nm p-doped GaAs\nbuffer \u0001p=1018 cm\u22123\u0002 was deposited at 580 \u00b0C followed by\n200 nm of a p-doped Al0.3Ga0.7As blocking layer. The intrin-\nsic \u0001i\u0002 region of the p-i-n structure consisted of 25 nm of\nundoped GaAs grown at 580 \u00b0C which was annealed for 10\nmin before the substrate temperature was reduced to 495 \u00b0C\nfor the growth of the QD layer. The QDs were formed by the\ndeposition of 2.4 ML of InAs, capped by 25 nm of undoped\nGaAs at 495 \u00b0C. The growth temperature was then raised to\n580 \u00b0C for the deposition of a 60 nm Al0.1Ga0.9As contact\nlayer. The doping profile of this layer was chosen so that it\nforms a thin triangular shaped Schottky barrier to the Fe\noverlayer. The structure was capped with a layer of Sb to\nprevent oxidation during transfer to a second molecular\nbeam epitaxy \u0001MBE\u0002 machine where after the removal of the\nSb cap a 10-nm-thick Fe contact was epitaxially grown at\n0 \u00b0C. The Fe layer was then covered by a 5 nm GaAs cap to\nprotect it from oxidation. The samples were processed into\nsurface emitting LEDs using conventional optical lithogra-\nphy, dry and wet processing steps.\nThe spin-LED cross section and the flatband diagram of\nthe device are depicted in Fig. 1. The structure consists of a\ncombination of two diodes, a Schottky formed by the\nFe\/AlGaAs\u0001n\u0002 barrier and an Al\u0001Ga\u0002As\/QDs n-i-p diode,\nconnected back to back. Under the bias conditions of Fig. 1,\nthe Schottky diode is reverse biased to allow efficient tun-\nneling of electrons from the Fe into the semiconductor while\nthe n-i-p diode is forward biased to ensure collection of in-\njected electrons and unpolarized holes from the p region, into\nthe QDs. Light emission is attributed to excitonic recombi-\nnation and occurs for bias voltages larger than 1.65 V.\nIn our samples, the magnetization of the thin Fe contact\nlies in plane due to shape anisotropy.

Redistribution subject toFigure 2 shows electroluminescence spectra in the vicin-\nity of the QD ground exciton emission at T=15 K, analyzed\nfor \u0005+ and \u0005\u2212 polarizations. The narrow linewidth\n\u0001full width at half maximum=22 meV\u0002 and long emission\nwavelength \u00011.031 eV\u0002 is a consequence of the low QD\ngrowth rate used.16 At zero applied magnetic field the \u0005+ and\n\u0005\n\u2212\ncomponents of the QD ground state exciton are almost\nequal, since there is no component of the electrons spin nor-\nmal to the surface. When a small magnetic field is applied at\n45\u00b0 to the sample normal, a nonzero spin component Sz is\ninduced that results in a measurable circular polarization of\nthe electroluminescence. The sign of the circular polarisation\n\u0001\u0005+\u0002 is consistent with injection of majority spins from the\nFe.\nThe circular polarisation Pcirc of the QD ground state\nexciton versus applied oblique \u000145\u00b0\u0002 magnetic field B is dis-\nplayed in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 \u0001black square symbols\u0002. The curve is non-\nlinear, with Pcirc rapidly increasing up to 40\u201350 mT and then\nslightly decreasing for higher B values. The slight asymme-\ntry of the data behavior between positive and negative mag-\nnetic fields is attributed to a small underestimation of the\nfield values due to limitations of the magnet calibration at\nvery low fields.

Based on the analysis of Ref. 7, a negligible tilting\nangle of less than 2\u00b0 is obtained due the small magnitude\n\u0001B\u0002100 mT\u0002 of the external magnetic field.\nBy subtracting the results of the PL control experiment\nfrom those obtained in the spin-LEDs, the circular polariza-\ntion due to spin-injection effects only is obtained \u0003Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004.\nThe curve is nonlinear and can be fitted within the frame-\nwork of the oblique Hanle effect by the Lorentzian function7\nSz\u0001B\u0002 = Soy \u00b7 \u0001TS\/\u0006\u0002 \u00b7 \u0003\u0001\u0001TS\u00022cos \u0007 sin \u0007\u0004\/\u00031 + \u0001\u0001TS\u00022\u0004 . \u00011\u0002\nHere TS is the QD ground exciton spin lifetime defined by\nthe exciton spin relaxation time \u0006S and the exciton recombi-\nnation lifetime \u0006\u0001TS\n\u22121\n=\u0006S\n\u22121+\u0006\u22121\u0002. According to the selection\nrules,14 Sz\u0001B\u0002 is simply equal to the circular polarization\nPcirc\u0001B\u0002 of the excitonic recombination in the quantum dots,\nassuming that the degeneracy of the heavy and light hole\nbands is lifted by the confinement\/strain.\nGood fits to the data are obtained using \u0003Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004 two\nsingle Lorentzians, one for positive \u0001half width B1\/2\n=24\u00b12.5 mT\u0002 and one for negative \u0001B1\/2=19\u00b11.5 mT\u0002 fields\ndue to the anisotropy mentioned earlier. Using an average\nvalue B1\/2 of 21.5\u00b12.9 mT, we derive a scaled ground state\nexciton spin lifetime g*Ts=\u0004 \/\u0003BB1\/2=510\u00b170 ps, which is\napproximately two times higher than g*Ts values obtained in\noptical Hanle measurements using quasiresonant laser\nexcitation.17,18 The enhancement could be related to the long\nwavelength emission of our QDs that ensures a large energy\ndifference between the lowest QD states and the InAs wet-\nting layer and is likely to reduce exciton spin dephasing.\nFrom the saturation value Sz max of the Hanle curve, we\nobtain an injected spin polarization from the Fe film to the\nsemiconductor, before recombination in the QDs of \b=Soy\n= \u00017.5\u00b10.7\u0002% \u00b7\u0006 \/TS. The 7.5% value is the measured steady-\nstate spin polarization in the QDs, Pspin, due to spin injection\neffects. The ratio TS \/\u0006 describes the exciton spin scattering\nin the dots and is estimated to be equal to 0.375\u00b10.05, using\nthe previously obtained value of 510 ps for g*TS, a ground\nstate exciton lifetime \u0006 of 800 ps, from time-resolved studies\nin our InAs dots19 and a g*-factor estimate of \u22121.7. A \b\nvalue of 20\u00b13.25% is then obtained; we note that a correct\nestimate of \b depends on a correct estimate of the g* factor.\nThe g* factor used was obtained from measurements on dots\nwith similar size and emission energy as ours;20 the negative\nsign is consistent with the variation of the optical polariza-\ntion with magnetic field observed in the PL control\nexperiment.\n\b values of the same order were reported in similar\nGaAs bulk-based spin-LED structures;7 this indicates that\nincorporation of the dot layer in the spin-LED structure does\nnot substantially affect the spin injection process from the\nmetal to the semiconductor.

We have measured an injected spin\npolarization Pspin in the QDs of 7.5% at low temperatures\nand obtain information on QD exciton spin dynamics \u0001half\nwidth B1\/2 and scaled ground state exciton spin lifetime\u0002.\nBased on those values, the spin injected polarization from\nthe Fe film into the semiconductor \b was estimated to be\naround 20% indicating a substantial spin loss in our spin\ndetector. Optimization of the dot layer, using, for example,\npositively charged QDs22 that exhibit larger spin relaxation\ntimes and shorter recombination times could result in im-\nproved Pspin values. The demonstrated electrical injection of\nspins at small magnetic fields \u0001\u0002100 mT\u0002 along with the\npotential for room temperature operation12 makes QD-based\nspin-LEDs promising candidates for the realization of prac-\ntical spintronic devices.\nThe authors thank W. van de Graaf and S.
