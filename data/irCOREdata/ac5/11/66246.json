We find that the new data still leave sizeable room for new-physics\ncontributions to B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing, which could be detected at the LHC.\nApril 2006\n\n1 Introduction\nOne of the most promising ways to detect the effects of new physics (NP) on B decays\nis to look for deviations of flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) processes from their\nStandard Model (SM) predictions; FCNC processes only occur at the loop-level in the SM\nand hence are particularly sensitive to NP virtual particles and interactions. A prominent\nexample that has received extensive experimental and theoretical attention is B0q\u2013B\u00af\n0\nq\nmixing (q \u2208 {d, s}), which, in the SM, is due to box diagrams with W -boson and up-\ntype quark exchange. In the language of effective field theory, these diagrams induce an\neffective Hamiltonian, which causes B0q and B\u00af\n0\nq mesons to mix and generates a \u2206B = 2\ntransition:\n\u3008B0q |H\u2206B=2eff |B\u00af0q \u3009 = 2MBqM q12 , (1)\nwhere MBq is the Bq-meson mass. Thanks to B\n0\nq\u2013B\u00af\n0\nq mixing, an initially present B\n0\nq\nstate evolves into a time-dependent linear combination of B0q and B\u00af\n0\nq flavour states. The\noscillation frequency of this phenomenon is characterized by the mass difference of the\n\u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d mass eigenstates,\n\u2206Mq \u2261M qH \u2212M qL = 2|M q12| , (2)\nand the CP-violating mixing phase\n\u03c6q = argM\nq\n12 , (3)\nwhich enters \u201cmixing-induced\u201d CP violation. The mass difference \u2206Mq can be \u2013 and has\nbeen \u2013 measured from the proper-time distribution of B0q candidates identified through\ntheir decays into (mostly) flavour-specific modes, after having been tagged as mixed or\nunmixed. The current experimental results are\n\u2206Md = (0.507\u00b1 0.004) ps\u22121 , \u2206Ms =\n[\n17.33+0.42\n\u22120.21(stat)\u00b1 0.07(syst)\n]\nps\u22121 , (4)\nwhere the value of \u2206Md is the world average quoted by the \u201cHeavy Flavour Averaging\nGroup\u201d (HFAG) [1]. Concerning \u2206Ms, only lower bounds were available for many years\nfrom the LEP experiments at CERN and SLD at SLAC [2]. Since the currently operating\ne+e\u2212 B factories run at the \u03a5(4S) resonance, which decays into Bu,d, but not into Bs\nmesons, the Bs system cannot be explored by the BaBar and Belle experiments. However,\nplenty of Bs mesons are produced at the Tevatron (and later on will be at the LHC), which\n\u2013 very recently \u2013 allowed the CDF collaboration to measure \u2206Ms with the result given\nabove [3]; the D0 collaboration has provided, also very recently, a two-sided bound on\n\u2206Ms at the 90% C.L. [4]:\n17 ps\u22121 < \u2206Ms < 21 ps\n\u22121, (5)\nwhich is compatible with the CDF measurement and corresponds to a 2.5 \u03c3 signal at\n\u2206Ms = 19 ps\n\u22121. These new results from the Tevatron have already triggered a couple of\nphenomenological papers [5]\u2013[11].\nIn the SM, M q12 is given by\nM q,SM12 =\nG2FM\n2\nW\n12\u03c02\nMBq \u03b7\u02c6\nBB\u02c6Bqf\n2\nBq(V\n\u2217\ntqVtb)\n2S0(xt) , (6)\n1\nwhere GF is Fermi\u2019s constant, MW the mass of the W boson, \u03b7\u02c6\nB = 0.552 a short-distance\nQCD correction (which is the same for the B0d and B\n0\ns systems) [12], whereas the \u201cbag\u201d\nparameter B\u02c6Bq and the decay constant fBq are non-perturbative quantities. Vtq and Vtb\nare elements of the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa (CKM) matrix [13, 14], and S0(xt \u2261\nm2t\/M\n2\nW ) = 2.35 \u00b1 0.06 with mt(mt) = (164.7 \u00b1 2.8)GeV [15] is one of the \u201cInami\u2013\nLim\u201d functions [16], describing the t-quark mass dependence of the box diagram with\ninternal t-quark exchange; the contributions of internal c and u quarks are, by virtue of\nthe Glashow\u2013Iliopoulos\u2013Maiani (GIM) mechanism [17], suppressed by (mu,c\/MW )\n2.\nThe mixing phases \u03c6q can be measured from \u201cmixing-induced\u201d CP asymmetries. In\nthe SM, one has\n\u03c6SMd = 2\u03b2 , \u03c6\nSM\ns = \u22122\u03b4\u03b3 , (7)\nwhere \u03b2 is the usual angle of the \u201cconventional\u201d unitarity triangle (UT) of the CKM\nmatrix, while \u03b4\u03b3 characterizes another unitarity triangle [18] that differs from the UT\nthrough O(\u03bb2) corrections in the Wolfenstein expansion [19].1\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility that B0q\u2013B\u00af\n0\nq mixing is modified\nby NP contributions at the tree level and\/or new particles in the loops. We shall find in\nparticular that \u2013 despite the apparently strong constraints posed by the precise measure-\nments of \u2206Mq in Eq. (4) \u2013 these results can contain potentially large NP contributions,\nwhich presently cannot be detected.\nThe outline of our paper is as follows: in Section 2, we collect the input parameters of\nour analysis and discuss the status of the relevant hadronic uncertainties. In Sections 3\nand 4, we then focus on the Bd- and Bs-meson systems, respectively, and investigate, in\na model-independent way, the size of possible NP contributions to \u2206Mq and \u03c6q in the\nlight of present and future experimental measurements and hadronic uncertainties. In\nthis analysis, we consider also a scenario for the experimental and theoretical situation\nin the year 2010, and set benchmarks for the required accuracy of the relevant hadronic\nparameters. It turns out that the situation in the Bs system is more favourable than in the\nBd system, and that still ample space for NP effects in B\n0\ns\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing is left, which could\nbe detected at the LHC. In Section 5, we complement the model-independent discussion\nof Sections 3 and 4 by analyses of two specific scenarios for NP: models with an extra Z \u2032\nboson and supersymmetry (SUSY) with an approximate alignment of quark and squark\nmasses. We summarize our conclusions in Section 6.\n2 Input Parameters and Hadronic Uncertainties\n2.1 CKM Parameters\nBefore going into the details of B0q\u2013B\u00af\n0\nq mixing and possible NP effects, let us first have\na closer look at the relevant input parameters and their uncertainties. Throughout our\nanalysis, we assume that the CKM matrix is unitary, and shall use this feature to express\nthe CKM elements entering B0q\u2013B\u00af\n0\nq mixing in terms of quantities that can be determined\n1Throughout this paper, we use the phase convention for the CKM matrix advocated by the Particle\nData Group [20], where the decay amplitudes of b\u2192 cc\u00afs processes carry essentially no CP-violating weak\nphase. Physical CP asymmetries are of course independent of the applied CKM phase convention, as\nshown explicitly in Ref. [21].\n2\nthrough tree-level processes of the SM. The key ro\u02c6le is then played by |Vcb| and |Vub|.\nThe former quantity is presently known with 2% precision from semileptonic B decays;\nin this paper we shall use the value obtained in Ref. [22] from the analysis of leptonic and\nhadronic moments in inclusive b\u2192 c\u2113\u03bd\u00af\u2113 transitions [23]:\n|Vcb| = (42.0\u00b1 0.7) \u00b7 10\u22123 ; (8)\nthis value agrees with that from exclusive decays.\nThe situation is less favourable with |Vub|: there is a 1 \u03c3 discrepancy between the\nvalues from inclusive and exclusive b\u2192 u\u2113\u03bd\u00af\u2113 transitions [1]:\n|Vub|incl = (4.4\u00b1 0.3) \u00b7 10\u22123 , |Vub|excl = (3.8\u00b1 0.6) \u00b7 10\u22123 . (9)\nThe error on |Vub|excl is dominated by the theoretical uncertainty of lattice and light-cone\nsum rule calculations of B \u2192 \u03c0 and B \u2192 \u03c1 transition form factors [24, 25], whereas for\n|Vub|incl experimental and theoretical errors are at par. We will use both results in our\nanalysis.\nWhereas any improvement of the error of |Vcb| will have only marginal impact on the\nanalysis of B mixing, a reduction of the uncertainty of |Vub| will be very relevant. As a\nbenchmark scenario for the situation in 2010, we will assume that the central value of\n|Vub|incl gets confirmed and that its uncertainty will shrink to \u00b10.2 \u00b7 10\u22123, i.e. 5%, thanks\nto better statistics and an increased precision of theoretical predictions, for instance from\nfurther developments in the dressed gluon exponentiation [26].\n2.2 Hadronic Mixing Parameters fBqB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBq\nThe next ingredient in the SM prediction for M q,SM12 are the non-perturbative matrix ele-\nments f 2BqB\u02c6Bq . These parameters have been the subject of numerous lattice calculations,\nboth quenched and unquenched, using various lattice actions and implementations of\nboth heavy and light quarks. The current front runners are unquenched calculations with\n2 and 3 dynamical quarks, respectively, and Wilson or staggered light quarks. Despite\ntremendous progress in recent years, the results still suffer from a variety of uncertain-\nties which is important to keep in mind when interpreting and using lattice results. One\nparticular difficulty in determining fBd is the chiral extrapolation needed to go to the\nphysical d-quark mass.2 Lattice calculations are usually performed at unphysically large\nu- and d-quark masses, as the simulation of dynamical fermions involves many inversions\nof the fermions\u2019 functional determinant in the path integral and is very dear in terms of\nCPU time. Therefore, an extrapolation, called the chiral extrapolation, in the light-quark\nmasses from feasible to physical masses is necessary, which is done using the functional\nform predicted by chiral perturbation theory. Based on these arguments, the chiral ex-\ntrapolation of B\u02c6Bd to the physical limit is expected to be smooth, whereas that of fBd\nis potentially prone to logarithms [28], which leads to a considerable increase in the un-\ncertainty. The most recent (unquenched) simulation by the JLQCD collaboration [29],\n2Many lattice simulations do not distinguish between u- and d-quark masses and use mu,d \u2261 (mu +\nmd)\/2. The physical value of the light-quark mass ratio is then mu,d\/ms = 0.041 \u00b1 0.003 from chiral\nperturbation theory [27].\n3\nwith non-relativistic b quarks and two flavours of dynamical light (Wilson) quarks, yields\nfBd = (0.191\u00b1 0.010+0.012\u22120.022)GeV and\nfBdB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBd\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nJLQCD\n= (0.215\u00b1 0.019+0\n\u22120.023)GeV ,\nfBsB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBs\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nJLQCD\n= (0.245\u00b1 0.021+0.003\n\u22120.002)GeV ,\n\u03beJLQCD \u2261 fBsB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBs\nfBdB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBd\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nJLQCD\n= 1.14\u00b1 0.06+0.13\n\u22120 , (10)\nwhere the first error includes uncertainties from statistics and various systematics, where-\nas the second, asymmetric error comes from the chiral extrapolation. Note that part of\nthe systematic errors cancel in the ratio \u03be. In this calculation, the ratio mu,d\/ms was\nvaried between 0.7 and 2.9.\nMore recently, (unquenched) simulations with three dynamical flavours have become\npossible using staggered quark actions. The HPQCD collaboration obtains fBd = (0.216\u00b1\n0.022)MeV [30], where a ratio of mu,d\/ms as small as 0.125 could be achieved, due to the\ngood chiral properties of the staggered action. This implies that the chiral extrapolation\nis less critical and the corresponding error much smaller. The quoted error on fBq is\nnow dominated by yet uncalculated higher-order matching terms which are needed to\nmatch the (effective theory) lattice calculations to continuum QCD. Lacking any direct\ncalculation of B\u02c6Bq with three dynamical flavours, and in view of the fact that the bag\nparameter is likely to be less sensitive to chiral extrapolation, it has been suggested to\ncombine the results of fBq from HPQCD with that of B\u02c6Bq from JLQCD, yielding [31]:\nfBdB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBd\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(HP+JL)QCD\n= (0.244\u00b1 0.026)GeV ,\nfBsB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBs\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(HP+JL)QCD\n= (0.295\u00b1 0.036)GeV ,\n\u03be(HP+JL)QCD = 1.210\n+0.047\n\u22120.035 , (11)\nwhere all errors are added in quadrature.\nAlthough we shall use both (10) and (11) in our analysis, we would like to stress that\nthe errors are likely to be optimistic. Apart from the issue of the chiral extrapolation\ndiscussed above, there is also the question of discretisation effects (JLQCD uses data\nobtained at only one lattice spacing) and the renormalisation of matrix elements (for\nlattice actions without chiral symmetry, the axial vector current is not conserved and\nfBq needs to be renormalised), which some argue should be done in a non-perturbative\nway [32]. Simulations with staggered quarks also face potential problems with unitarity,\nlocality and an odd number of flavours (see, for instance, Ref. [33]). A confirmation of the\nHPQCD results by simulations using the (theoretically better understood) Wilson action\nwith small quark masses will certainly be highly welcome.\nGiven this situation, we consider it not very likely that the errors on fBq , B\u02c6Bq and \u03be\nwill come down considerably in the near future. For our benchmark 2010 scenario, we\nhence will assume the values of hadronic parameters and uncertainties given in (11).\nWe are now well prepared for the discussion of B0q\u2013B\u00af\n0\nq mixing.\n4\n0 100 200 300\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n\u03c3q [deg]\n\u03ba\nq\nFigure 1: The dependence of \u03baq on \u03c3q for values of \u03c1q varied between 1.4 (most upper\ncurve) and 0.6 (most inner curve), in steps of 0.1.

In the presence of NP,\nthe matrix element Md12 can be written, in a model-independent way, as\nMd12 = M\nd,SM\n12\n(\n1 + \u03bade\ni\u03c3d\n)\n,\nwhere the real parameter \u03bad \u2265 0 measures the \u201cstrength\u201d of the NP contribution with\nrespect to the SM, whereas \u03c3d is a new CP-violating phase; analogous formulae apply to\nthe Bs system. The Bd mixing parameters then read\n\u2206Md = \u2206M\nSM\nd\n[\n1 + \u03bade\ni\u03c3d\n]\n, (12)\n\u03c6d = \u03c6\nSM\nd + \u03c6\nNP\nd = \u03c6\nSM\nd + arg(1 + \u03bade\ni\u03c3d) . (13)\nThe experimental result for \u2206Md and the theoretical prediction \u2206M\nSM\nd provide the fol-\nlowing constraint on \u03bad and \u03c3d:\n\u03c1d \u2261\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2206Md\u2206MSMd\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 =\n\u221a\n1 + 2\u03bad cos\u03c3d + \u03ba\n2\nd , (14)\nwhich determines, for instance, \u03bad as function of \u03c3d:\n\u03bad = \u2212 cos\u03c3d \u00b1\n\u221a\n\u03c12d \u2212 sin2 \u03c3d . (15)\nIn Fig. 1, we illustrate the corresponding contours in the \u03c3d\u2013\u03bad plane for values of \u03c1d\nbetween 0.6 and 1.4, varied in steps of 0.1. Interestingly enough, a value of \u03c1d smaller\nthan 1 imposes a constraint on the weak NP phase \u03c3d:\n\u03c0 \u2212 arcsin \u03c1d \u2264 \u03c3d \u2264 \u03c0 + arcsin \u03c1d. (16)\n5\n3.2 The SM Prediction for \u2206Md\nIn order to make use of these constraints, one needs to know the SM prediction \u2206MSMd .\nIn particular, one has to make sure that the parameters entering Md,SM12 , Eq. (6), are free\nfrom NP. This can be achieved, to very good accuracy, by expressing the relevant CKM\nfactor in \u2206MSMd in terms of parameters measured in tree-level processes. To this end, we\nuse the Wolfenstein parametrization [19], as generalized in Ref. [34], and the unitarity of\nthe CKM matrix to write\n|V \u2217tdVtb| = |Vcb|\u03bb\n\u221a\n1\u2212 2Rb cos \u03b3 +R2b . (17)\nHere the quantity Rb is given by\nRb \u2261\n(\n1\u2212 \u03bb\n2\n2\n)\n1\n\u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223VubVcb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 =\n\u221a\n\u03c1\u00af2 + \u03b7\u00af2, (18)\nwith\n\u03c1\u00af = (1\u2212 \u03bb2\/2)\u03c1 = Rb cos \u03b3, \u03b7\u00af = (1\u2212 \u03bb2\/2)\u03b7 = Rb sin \u03b3 ; (19)\nRb measures one side of the UT, and \u03b3 denotes the usual UT angle.\nAs we saw in Section 2, |Vcb| and |Vub| can be determined from semileptonic B decays,\nwhich arise at tree level in the SM and hence are very robust with respect to NP effects.\nA similar comment applies to the Wolfenstein parameter \u03bb \u2261 |Vus| [19, 34], which can\nbe determined, for instance, from K \u2192 \u03c0\u2113\u03bd\u00af\u2113 decays. Using the values of |Vcb| and |Vub|\ndiscussed in Section 2 and \u03bb = 0.225\u00b1 0.001 [35], we obtain\nRinclb = 0.45\u00b1 0.03 , Rexclb = 0.39\u00b1 0.06 , (20)\nwhere the labels \u201cincl\u201d and \u201cexcl\u201d refer to the determinations of |Vub| through inclusive\nand exclusive b\u2192 u\u2113\u03bd\u00af\u2113 transitions, respectively.\nThe angle \u03b3 can be determined in a variety of ways through CP-violating effects in pure\ntree decays of type B \u2192 D(\u2217)K(\u2217) [36]. Using the present B-factory data, the following\nresults were obtained through a combination of various methods:\n\u03b3|D(\u2217)K(\u2217) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n(62+35\u221225)\n\u25e6 (CKMfitter collaboration [37]),\n(65\u00b1 20)\u25e6 (UTfit collaboration [38]). (21)\nA more precise value for \u03b3 was obtained in Ref. [39], from the B-factory data on CP\nasymmetries in B0d \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 and B0d \u2192 \u03c0\u2212K+ decays, which receive both tree and penguin\ncontributions:\n\u03b3|\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212,\u03c0\u2212K+ = (73.9+5.8\u22126.5)\u25e6. (22)\nWithin the NP scenario of modified electroweak penguins considered in Ref. [39], (22)\nis not affected by NP effects. The central value of (22) is higher than that of (21), but\nboth results are perfectly consistent because of the large errors of the B \u2192 D(\u2217)K(\u2217)\ndeterminations. An even larger value of \u03b3 in the ballpark of 80\u25e6 was recently extracted\nfrom B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 data with the help of \u201csoft collinear effective theory\u201d (SCET) [40].\nIn our analysis, we use the UTfit value\n\u03b3 = (65\u00b1 20)\u25e6.

In\nfact, a statistical accuracy of \u03c3stat(\u03b3) \u2248 2.5\u25e6 is expected at LHCb after 5 years of taking\ndata [41].\nFor the convenience of the reader, we summarise all CKM input parameters, as well\nas their counterparts for the Bs system to be discussed in Section 4, in Tab. 1; in Tab. 2,\nwe give the input data for our 2010 scenario.\nIn Fig. 2, we illustrate the dependence of \u03c1d defined in (14) on \u03b3, Rb and fBdB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBd\n. It\nis evident that \u03c1d depends rather strongly on \u03b3 and fBdB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBd\n, but less so on Rb.

Using (13), a given value of \u03c6\nNP\nd allows\none to determine \u03bad as a function of \u03c3d with the help of the following expressions, which\nhold again in the general case q \u2208 {d, s}:\n\u03baq =\ntan\u03c6NPq\nsin \u03c3q \u2212 cos\u03c3q tan\u03c6NPq\n, (26)\nsin \u03c6NPq =\n\u03baq sin \u03c3q\u221a\n1 + 2\u03baq cos\u03c3q + \u03ba2q\n, cos \u03c6NPq =\n1 + \u03baq cos\u03c3q\u221a\n1 + 2\u03baq cos\u03c3q + \u03ba2q\n. (27)\nIn Fig. 3, we illustrate the corresponding contours for various values of \u03c6NPq . Note in\nparticular that \u03baq is bounded from below for any given value of \u03c6\nNP\nq 6= 0. The relation\nbetween the allowed values of \u03c6NPq and \u03baq is given by\n\u03c6NP,max(min)q = arg\n{\n1 + \u03baq\n(\n\u2212\u03ba2q \u00b1 i\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03ba2q\n)}\n, (28)\ni.e. for any non-zero value of \u03c6NPq , \u03baq must be larger than the minimum value plotted in\nFig. 4.\n9\nIn order to make use of these theoretically clean contours, one needs to determine the\nNP phase \u03c6NPq . As is well known, \u03c6d can be experimentally accessed in the mixing-induced\nCP asymmetry of the \u201cgolden\u201d decay B0d \u2192 J\/\u03c8KS (and similar b \u2192 cc\u00afs charmonium\nmodes) [42]. The most recent average of the B-factory data for such transitions obtained\nby HFAG is [1]\n(sin\u03c6d)cc\u00afs = 0.687\u00b1 0.032 . (29)\nIn principle, this quantity could be affected by NP contributions to both B0d\u2013B\u00af\n0\nd mixing\nand b\u2192 cc\u00afs decay amplitudes [43, 44]. A probe of the latter effects is provided by decays\nlike Bd \u2192 D\u03c00, D\u03c10, . . ., which are pure tree decays and do not receive any penguin con-\ntributions. If the neutral D mesons are observed through their decays into CP eigenstates\nD\u00b1, these decays allow an extremely clean determination of the \u201ctrue\u201d value of sin\u03c6d [45].\nA possible discrepancy with (sin \u03c6d)cc\u00afs would be attributed to NP contributions to the\nb \u2192 cc\u00afs decay amplitudes. Consequently, detailed feasibility studies for the exploration\nof Bd \u2192 D\u03c00, D\u03c10, ... modes at a super-B factory are strongly encouraged. In this paper,\nhowever, we assume that NP effects entering decay amplitudes are negligible. Eq. (13)\nthen gives the following expression:\n(sin \u03c6d)cc\u00afs \u2261 sin\u03c6d = sin(2\u03b2 + \u03c6NPd ) . (30)\nThe experimental value (29) yields the twofold solution\n\u03c6d = (43.4\u00b1 2.5)\u25e6 \u2228 (136.6\u00b1 2.5)\u25e6, (31)\nwhere the latter result is in dramatic conflict with global CKM fits and would require a\nlarge NP contribution to B0d\u2013B\u00af\n0\nd mixing [46, 47]. However, experimental information on\nthe sign of cos\u03c6d rules out a negative value of this quantity at greater than 95% C.L. [36],\nso that we are left with \u03c6d = (43.4\u00b1 2.5)\u25e6.\nThe SM prediction of the mixing phase, \u03c6SMd = 2\u03b2, Eq. (7), can easily be obtained in\nterms of the tree-level quantities Rb and \u03b3, as\nsin \u03b2 =\nRb sin \u03b3\u221a\n1\u2212 2Rb cos \u03b3 +R2b\n, cos \u03b2 =\n1\u2212Rb cos \u03b3\u221a\n1\u2212 2Rb cos \u03b3 +R2b\n. (32)\nUsing Eq. (13), the experimental value of \u03c6d can then immediately be converted into a\nresult for the NP phase \u03c6NPd , which depends on \u03b3 and Rb as illustrated in Fig. 5. It is\nevident that the dependence of \u03c6NPd on \u03b3 is very small and that Rb plays actually the key\nro\u02c6le for its determination. Hence, we have a situation complementary to that shown in\nFig. 2, where the main dependence was on \u03b3.

Although this result hinges\non the value of |Vub|incl, and hence presently is not conclusive, the underlying reason-\ning also applies to the Bs system: even a small NP phase \u03c6\nNP\ns implies considerable NP\ncontributions to the mixing matrix element Ms12.\n3.4 Combined Constraints on NP through \u2206Md and \u03c6d: 2006\nand 2010\nWe are now finally in a position to combine the constraints from both \u2206Md and \u03c6d to\nconstrain the allowed region in the \u03c3d\u2013\u03bad plane. The corresponding results are shown in\nFig. 6, demonstrating the power of the contours described in the previous subsections for\na transparent determination of \u03c3d and \u03bad. We see that a non-vanishing value of \u03c6\nNP\nd , even\nas small as \u03c6NPd \u2248 \u221210\u25e6, has a strong impact on the allowed space in the \u03c3d\u2013\u03bad plane. In\nboth scenarios with different lattice results and different values for |Vub|, the upper bounds\nof \u03bad \u223c< 2.5 on the NP contributions following from the experimental value of \u2206Md are\nreduced to \u03bad \u223c< 0.5. Values of this order of magnitude are expected, for instance, on the\nbasis of generic field-theoretical considerations [43, 47], as well as in a recently proposed\nframework for \u201cnext-to-minimal flavour violation\u201d [49, 10].\nIn order to determine \u03bad more precisely, it is mandatory to reduce the errors of \u03c1d,\nwhich come from both \u03b3 and lattice calculations. As we noted above, the value of \u03b3\ncan be determined \u2013 with impressive accuracy \u2013 at the LHC [41], whereas progress on\nthe lattice side is much harder to predict, but will hopefully be made.

In order to describe NP effects in a\nmodel-independent way, we parametrize them analogously to (12) and (13). The relevant\nCKM factor is |V \u2217tsVtb|. Using once again the unitarity of the CKM matrix and including\nnext-to-leading order terms in the Wolfenstein expansion as given in Ref. [34], we have\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223VtsVcb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 1\u2212 12 (1\u2212 2Rb cos \u03b3)\u03bb2 +O(\u03bb4). (35)\nConsequently, apart from the tiny correction in \u03bb2, the CKM factor for \u2206Ms is indepen-\ndent of \u03b3 and Rb, which is an important advantage in comparison with the Bd-meson\nsystem. The accuracy of the SM prediction of \u2206Ms is hence limited by the hadronic\nmixing parameter fBsB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBs . Using the numerical values discussed in Section 2, we obtain\n\u2206MSMs\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\nJLQCD\n= (16.1\u00b1 2.8) ps\u22121 ,\n12\n\u03ba\ns\n\u03c3s [deg]\n0 100 200 300\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n0 100 200 300\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n\u03ba\ns\n\u03c3s [deg]\nFigure 8: The allowed regions (yellow\/grey) in the \u03c3s\u2013\u03bas plane.

The values of \u03c1s, which\nis defined in analogy to (14), refer to the CDF measurement of \u2206Ms in (4). These\nnumbers are consistent with the SM case \u03c1s = 1, but suffer from significant theoretical\nuncertainties, which are much larger than the experimental errors. Nevertheless, it is\ninteresting to note that the (HP+JL)QCD result is 1.5 \u03c3 below the SM; a similar pattern\narises in (25), though at the 1 \u03c3 level. Any more precise statement about the presence or\nabsence of NP requires the reduction of theoretical uncertainties.\nIn Fig. 8, we show the constraints in the \u03c3s\u2013\u03bas plane, which can be obtained from\n\u03c1s with the help of the Bs counterpart of (15). We see that upper bounds of \u03bas \u223c< 2.5\narise from the measurement of \u2206Ms. In the case of (36), the bound on \u03c3s following\nfrom (16) would interestingly be effective, and imply 110\u25e6 \u2264 \u03c3s \u2264 250\u25e6. Consequently,\nthe CDF measurement of \u2206Ms leaves ample space for the NP parameters \u03c3s and \u03bas.\nThis situation will change significantly as soon as information about CP violation in the\nBs-meson system becomes available. We shall return to this topic in Subsection 4.3.\n4.2 Constraints on NP through \u2206Ms and \u2206Md\nIt is interesting to consider the ratio of \u2206Ms and \u2206Md, which can be written as follows:\n\u2206Ms\n\u2206Md\n=\n\u03c1s\n\u03c1d\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223VtsVtd\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2 MBs\nMBd\n\u03be2 , (37)\nwhere the hadronic SU(3)-breaking parameter \u03be is defined in Subsection 2.2. In the class\nof NP models with \u201cminimal flavour violation\u201d [50],3 which contains also the SM, we have\n\u03c1s\/\u03c1d = 1, so that (37) allows the extraction of the CKM factor |Vts\/Vtd|, and hence |Vtd|,\n3See Ref. [51] for a review, and Ref. [9] for a recent analysis addressing also the \u2206Ms measurement.\n13\n\u03b3 [deg]\n\u03c1\ns\n\/\u03c1\nd\n40 50 60 70 80 90\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n\u03b3 [deg]\n\u03c1\ns\n\/\u03c1\nd\n40 50 60 70 80 90\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nFigure 9: The dependence of \u03c1s\/\u03c1d on \u03b3 for the central values of \u2206Md,s in (4).

The advantage of this determination\nlies in the reduced theoretical uncertainty of \u03be as compared to fBdB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBd\n.\nIn this paper, however, we turn the tables and constrain the ratio \u03c1s\/\u03c1d through\n\u2206Ms\/\u2206Md. To this end, we express \u2013 in analogy to (17) \u2013 the UT side\nRt \u2261 1\n\u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223VtdVcb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 1\u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223VtdVts\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n[\n1\u2212 1\n2\n(1\u2212 2Rb cos \u03b3)\u03bb2 +O(\u03bb4)\n]\n(38)\nin terms of Rb and \u03b3:\nRt =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 2Rb cos \u03b3 +R2b , (39)\nallowing the determination of Rt through processes that are essentially unaffected by\nNP. The resulting value of Rt depends rather strongly on \u03b3, which is the main source\nof uncertainty. Another determination of Rt that is independent of \u03b3 and Rb can, in\nprinciple, be obtained from radiative decays, in particular the ratio of branching ratios\nB(B \u2192 (\u03c1, \u03c9)\u03b3)\/B(B \u2192 K\u2217\u03b3), but is presently limited by experimental statistics; see\nRef. [52] for a recent analysis.\nCombining (37) and (38), we obtain the following expression for \u03c1s\/\u03c1d:\n\u03c1s\n\u03c1d\n= \u03bb2\n[\n1\u2212 2Rb cos \u03b3 +R2b\n] [\n1 + (1\u2212 2Rb cos \u03b3)\u03bb2 +O(\u03bb4)\n] 1\n\u03be2\nMBd\nMBs\n\u2206Ms\n\u2206Md\n. (40)\nIn Fig. 9, we plot this ratio for the central values of \u2206Md and \u2206Ms in (4), as a function of\nthe UT angle \u03b3 for the values of \u03be given in (10) and (11). We find that the corresponding\ncurves are nearly independent of Rb and that \u03b3 is actually the key CKM parameter for\nthe determination of \u03c1s\/\u03c1d. The corresponding numerical values are given by:\n\u03c1s\n\u03c1d\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nJLQCD\n= 1.11+0.02\n\u22120.01(exp)\u00b1 0.35(\u03b3,Rb)+0.12\u22120.28(\u03be) ,\n\u03c1s\n\u03c1d\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n(HP+JL)QCD\n= 0.99+0.02\n\u22120.01(exp)\u00b1 0.31(\u03b3,Rb)+0.06\u22120.08(\u03be) . (41)\n14\nBecause of the large range of allowed values of \u03b3, Eq. (23), this ratio is currently not very\nstringently constrained. This situation should, however, improve significantly in the LHC\nera thanks to the impressive determination of \u03b3 to be obtained at the LHCb experiment.\nFor our 2010 scenario as specified in Tab. 2, which corresponds to the right panel of Fig. 9\nwith \u03b3 = (70\u00b1 5)\u25e6, we find:\n\u03c1s\n\u03c1d\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2010\n= 1.07\u00b1 0.09(\u03b3,Rb)+0.06\u22120.08(\u03be) = 1.07\u00b1 0.12 , (42)\nwhere we made the errors arising from the uncertainties of \u03b3 and \u03be explicit, and, in the\nlast step, added them in quadrature. Consequently, the hadronic uncertainties and those\ninduced by \u03b3 would now be of the same size, which should provide additional motivation\nfor the lattice community to reduce the error of \u03be even further. Despite the impressive\nreduction of uncertainty compared to the 2006 values in (41), the numerical value in\n(42) would still not allow a stringent test of whether \u03c1s\/\u03c1d equals one: to establish a 3 \u03c3\ndeviation from 1, central values of \u03c1s\/\u03c1d = 1.4 or 0.7 would be needed. The assumed\nuncertainty of \u03b3 of 5\u25e6 could also turn out to be too pessimistic, in which case even more\nprogress would be needed from the lattice side to match the experimental accuracy.\nThe result in (42) would not necessarily suggest that there is no physics beyond the\nSM. In fact, and as can be seen from Tab. 2, the central values of \u03c1d and \u03c1s would both\nbe smaller than one, i.e. would both deviate from the SM picture, although the hadronic\nuncertainties would again not allow us to draw definite conclusions. In order to shed\nfurther light on these possible NP contributions, the exploration of CP-violating effects\nin the Bs-meson system is essential.\n4.3 CP Violation in the Bs-System\nTo date, the CP-violating phase associated with B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing is completely uncon-\nstrained. In the SM, it is doubly Cabibbo-suppressed, and can be written as follows:\n\u03c6SMs = \u22122\u03bb2\u03b7 = \u22122\u03bb2Rb sin \u03b3 \u2248 \u22122\u25e6. (43)\nHere we used again (19) to express the Wolfenstein parameter \u03b7 in terms of Rb and \u03b3.\nBecause of the small SM phase in (43), B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing is particularly well suited to search\nfor NP effects, which may well lead to a sizeable value of \u03c6s [53, 54]. In order to test the\nSM and probe CP-violating NP contributions to B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing, the decay B\n0\ns \u2192 J\/\u03c8\u03c6,\nwhich is very accessible at the LHC [18], plays a key ro\u02c6le. Thanks to mixing-induced\nCP violation in the time-dependent angular distribution of the J\/\u03c8[\u2192 \u2113+\u2113\u2212]\u03c6[\u2192 K+K\u2212]\ndecay products, the quantity\nsin \u03c6s = sin(\u22122\u03bb2Rb sin \u03b3 + \u03c6NPs ) (44)\ncan be measured [55, 56], in analogy to the determination of sin\u03c6d through B\n0\nd \u2192 J\/\u03c8KS.\nAfter one year of data taking (which corresponds to 2 fb\u22121), LHCb expects a measure-\nment with the statistical accuracy \u03c3stat(sin \u03c6s) \u2248 0.031; adding modes such as Bs \u2192\nJ\/\u03c8\u03b7, J\/\u03c8\u03b7\u2032 and \u03b7c\u03c6, \u03c3stat(sin\u03c6s) \u2248 0.013 is expected after five years [41]. Also ATLAS\nand CMS will contribute to the measurement of sin \u03c6s, expecting uncertainties at the 0.1\nlevel after one year of data taking, which corresponds to 10 fb\u22121 [57, 58].\n15\n50 60 70 80 90\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n= 0.35Rb\nRb = 0.40\nRb = 0.45\nRb = 0.50\n\u03b3 [deg]\nsi\nn\n\u03c6\ns\nSM\n0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\nsi\nn\n\u03c6\ns\nRb\nFigure 10: sin\u03c6s for a scenario with flavour-universal NP, i.e. \u03c6\nNP\ns = \u03c6\nNP\nd , as specified in\nEq.

This scenario would be supported by (42), although\nit would not belong to the class of models with MFV, as new sources of CP violation\nwould be required. As we have seen in the previous section, the analysis of the B0d data\nfor Rinclb = 0.45 indicates a small NP phase around \u221210\u25e6 in the Bd-system. In the above\nscenario, that would imply the presence of the same phase in the Bs-system, which would\ninterfere constructively with the small SM phase and result in CP asymmetries at the level\nof \u221220%. CP-violating effects of that size can easily be detected at the LHC. This exercise\ndemonstrates again the great power of the Bs-meson system to reveal CP-violating NP\ncontributions to B0q\u2013B\u00af\n0\nq mixing. The presence of a small NP phase could actually be\nconsiderably magnified, as illustrated in Fig. 10. In specific NP scenarios, also large CP-\nviolating phases can still arise, and are in no way excluded by the CDF measurement of\n\u2206Ms in (4).\nLet us finally also discuss the impact of CP violation measurements on the allowed\nregion in the \u03c3s\u2013\u03bas plane in our 2010 scenario. To this end, we consider two cases:\ni) (sin\u03c6s)exp = \u22120.04\u00b1 0.02, in accordance with the SM;\nii) (sin\u03c6s)exp = \u22120.20\u00b1 0.02, in accordance with the NP scenario of Fig. 10.\nThe measurement of sin\u03c6s implies a twofold solution for \u03c6s and, therefore, also for \u03c6\nNP\ns .\nHowever, this ambiguity can be resolved through the determination of the sign of cos\u03c6s,\nwhich can be fixed through the strategies proposed in Ref. [55]. In Fig. 11, we show\nthe situation in the \u03c3s\u2013\u03bas plane.\n4 The dotted lines refer to negative values of cos\u03c6s.\nAssuming that these are experimentally excluded, we are left with strongly restricted\nregions, although \u03bas could still take sizeable ranges, with upper bounds \u03bas \u2248 0.5. In\nthe SM-like scenario, values of \u03c3s around 180\n\u25e6 would arise, i.e. a NP contribution with\n4The closed lines agree with those shown in the right panel of Fig. 8, as our 2010 scenario is based on\nthe (HP+JL)QCD lattice results.\n16\n0 100 200 300\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n\u03ba\ns\n\u03c3s [deg]\n\u03ba\ns\n\u03c3s [deg]\n0 100 200 300\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\nFigure 11: Combined constraints for the allowed region (yellow\/grey) in the \u03c3s\u2013\u03bas plane\nthrough \u2206Ms in (4) for the (HP+JL)QCD results (11) and CP violation measurements.\nLeft panel: the SM scenario (sin \u03c6s)exp = \u22120.04\u00b1 0.02.

However, due to the absence of new CP-violating effects, the\naccuracy of lattice results would have to be considerably improved in order to allow the\nextraction of a value of \u03bas incompatible with 0. On the other hand, a measurement of\n(sin\u03c6s)exp = \u22120.20 \u00b1 0.02 would give a NP signal at the 10 \u03c3 level, with \u03bas \u223c> 0.2 from\nEq. (28). In analogy to the discussion in Subsection 3.4, a determination of \u03bas with 10%\nuncertainty requires fBsB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBs with 5% accuracy, i.e. the corresponding error in (11) has to\nbe reduced by a factor of 2.\nSince the discussion given so far does not refer to a specific model of NP, the question\narises whether there are actually extensions of the SM that still allow large CP-violating\nNP phases in B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing.\n5 Specific Models of New Physics\nIn this section, we address the impact of the CDF measurement of \u2206Ms on two popular\nscenarios of NP, to wit\n\u2022 an extra Z \u2032 boson with flavour non-diagonal couplings;\n\u2022 generic effects in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) in the\n\u201cmass insertion approximation\u201d.\nWe would like to stress that our examples for NP scenarios should be viewed as illustrative\nrather than comprehensive and are not intended to compete with more dedicated analyses.\n5.1 Z\u2032 Gauge Boson with Non-Universal Couplings\nLet us start with the effect of an extra U(1)\u2032 gauge boson Z \u2032, which is the most simple\napplication of the model-independent method discussed in Sections 3 and 4. The existence\n17\nof a new Z \u2032 gauge boson can induce FCNC processes at tree-level if the Z \u2032 coupling to\nphysical fermions is non-diagonal. Such Z \u2032 bosons often occur, for instance, in the context\nof grand unified theories (GUTs), superstring theories, and theories with large extra\ndimensions, see, for instance, Refs. [59, 60]. In this paper, we illustrate the constraints on\nan extra Z \u2032 under the conditions that\n\u2022 the Z couplings stay flavour diagonal, i.e. Z\u2013Z \u2032 mixing is negligible and the Z does\nnot contribute to B mixing;\n\u2022 the Z \u2032 has flavour non-diagonal couplings only to left-handed quarks, which means\nthat its effect is described by only one complex parameter.\nNote that the Z \u2032 contribution to Bs mixing is related to that for hadronic, leptonic and\nsemileptonic decays in specific models where the Z \u2032 coupling to light quarks and leptons\nis known; in this paper, however, we treat the Z \u2032 in a model-independent way and assume\nits couplings to the bL and sL quark fields as independent. We only discuss the Bs-system\nand closely follow the notations of Ref. [61], where an earlier analysis of this scenario was\ngiven.\nA purely left-handed off-diagonal Z \u2032 coupling to b and s quarks gives the following\ncontribution to Ms12:\n5\nMs,Z\n\u2032\n12 =\nGF\u221a\n2\n\u03c12Le\n2i\u03c6L\n4\n3\n\u03b7\u02c6BB\u02c6Bsf\n2\nBsMBs , (46)\nwhere \u03c1Le\ni\u03c6L \u2261 (g\u2032MZ)\/(gMZ\u2032)BLsb is defined in terms of the SM UY (1) gauge coupling g,\nthe U(1)\u2032 coupling g\u2032, the respective gauge boson masses MZ,Z\u2032 and the FCNC coupling\nBLsb of the Z\n\u2032 to bL and sL. Generically, one would expect g\/g\n\u2032 = O(1), if both U(1)\ngroups have the same origin, for instance in a GUT framework, and MZ\/MZ\u2032 = O(0.1)\nfor a TeV-scale Z \u2032. If in addition the size of the Z \u2032 couplings BL is set by the quarks\u2019\nYukawa couplings, one also expects |BLsb| \u2248 |V \u2217tsVtb| and \u03c1L = O(10\u22123).\nThe impact of the CDF measurement of \u2206Ms on this model can be directly read off\nFig. 8 through the identifications\n\u03c1L \u2194 (\u03bas\/f)1\/2, \u03c6L \u2194 \u03c3s\/2 ,\nwith\nf =\n16\u03c02\u221a\n2\n1\nGFM2WS0(xt)|Vts|2\n= (3.57\u00b1 0.01) \u00b7 105 .\nPresently, values of \u03bas as large as 2.5 are still allowed, see Fig. 8, which corresponds to\n\u03c1L < 2.6 \u00b7 10\u22123 . (47)\nIf a non-zero value of the NP phase \u03c6NPs should be measured at the LHC, this value can\nbe immediately translated into a lower bound on \u03c1L, using (28).

Any more precise constraint on \u03c1L will depend on the\nprogress in lattice determinations of fBsB\u02c6\n1\/2\nBs .\nThe upper bound on \u03c1L given in Eq. (47) can be converted into a lower bound on the\nZ \u2032 mass:\n1.5TeV\n(\ng\u2032\ng\n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223B\nL\nsb\nVts\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < MZ\u2032 . (49)\nIn the scenario of (48), there is also an upper bound and the lower bound is raised:\n3 TeV\n(\ng\u2032\ng\n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223B\nL\nsb\nVts\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < MZ\u2032 < 7.5TeV\n(\ng\u2032\ng\n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223B\nL\nsb\nVts\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (50)\nWe would like to stress again that these bounds apply to a model where the Z \u2032 has flavour\nnon-diagonal couplings only to left-handed quarks. Eq. (50) can be compared to the exist-\ning lower bounds on the Z \u2032 mass from direct searches, as for instance quoted by CDF [62];\nthese limits are model-dependent, but in the ballpark of \u223c 800GeV, which is perfectly\ncompatible with (50). On the other hand, if a Z \u2032 was found in direct searches at the\nTevatron or the LHC, the bounds on \u03c1L would constrain its couplings. This is particu-\nlarly interesting in a framework with nearly family-universal couplings and illustrates the\npotential synergy between direct searches for NP and constraints from flavour physics.\nNote that (47) can also be translated into an upper bound on the branching ratio of\nBs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212, at least if the coupling of the Z \u2032 to \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 is known. The relevance of such a\nbound is not quite clear, however, since we have set the coupling of the Z \u2032 to right-handed\nfermions to 0.\n5.2 MSSM in the Mass Insertion Approximation\nLet us now discuss B mixing in supersymmetry. Whereas in the SM flavour violation\nis parametrized by the CKM matrix, in SUSY there are many more possible ways in\nwhich both lepton and quark flavours can change. This is because scalar quarks and\nleptons carry the flavour quantum numbers of their SUSY partners, which implies that\nflavour violation in the scalar sector can lead to flavour violation in the observed fermionic\nsector of the theory. The parameters controlling flavour violation in the MSSM are quite\nnumerous \u2013 there are about 100 soft SUSY breaking parameters which could give rise to\nhuge \u2013 and unobserved \u2013 flavour violation. One way to defuse this so-called SUSY flavour\nproblem is to assume that the squark (and slepton) masses are approximately aligned\nwith the quark (and lepton) masses. \u201cAlignment\u201d means that, in the basis of physical\nstates, where the fermion masses are diagonal, the scalar mass matrices are approximately\ndiagonal as well. In this case, one can treat the off-diagonal terms in the sfermion mass\nmatrices,\n(\u03b4fij)AB \u2261 (\u2206m2ij)AB\/m2f\u02dc ,\nas perturbations. Here i, j = 1, 2, 3 are family indices, A,B = L,R refers to the \u201cchiral-\nity\u201d of the sfermions6 and mf\u02dc is the average sfermion mass. This so-called mass insertion\napproximation (MIA) has been first introduced in Ref. [63], and was extensively applied\n6Sfermions are scalar particles and hence have no chirality; the labels L and R refer to the fact that\nthey are the SUSY partners of left- and right-handed quark fields, respectively.\n19\nto FCNC and CP-violating phenomena in Ref. [64]. Its strength is the fact that it is\nindependent of specific model assumptions on the values of soft SUSY-breaking parame-\nters, but its weakness is that there are many free parameters, so there is a certain loss of\npredictive power. In this paper, we do not attempt a sophisticated analysis, which will\nonly be possible once a full NLO calculation of the corresponding short-distance functions\nhas become available, which is in preparation, see Ref. [65]. Rather, we would like to il-\nlustrate the impact of the constraints from \u2206Ms on the dominant mass insertions, along\nthe lines of, for instance, Refs. [66, 8]. Bounds on mass insertions from Bd mixing have\nbeen investigated in Ref. [67].\nIn supersymmetric theories the effective Hamiltonian H\u2206B=2eff responsible for B mixing,\nsee Eq. (1), is generated by the SM box diagrams with W exchange and box diagrams\nmediated by charged Higgs, neutralino, photino, gluino and chargino exchange. For small\nvalues of tan\u03b2SUSY, which is the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two MSSM\nHiggs doublets, the Higgs contributions are suppressed by the quark masses and can\nbe neglected. Photino and neutralino diagrams are also heavily suppressed compared to\nthose from gluino and chargino exchange, due to the smallness of the electroweak couplings\ncompared to \u03b1s. The gluino contribution was calculated in Ref. [64], the chargino one\nin Ref. [68]. The analysis of Ref. [66] has shown that the chargino contributions are also\nvery small, so that the B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns transition matrix element is given, to good accuracy, by\nMs12 = M\ns,SM\n12 +M\ns,g\u02dc\n12 , (51)\nwhere Ms,SM12 and M\ns,g\u02dc\n12 indicate the SM and gluino contributions, respectively. It turns\nout that the largest contribution to Ms,g\u02dc12 comes from terms in (\u03b4\nd\n23)LL(\u03b4\nd\n23)RR, whereas\nchirality flipping LR and RL mass insertions are only poorly constrained from Bs mixing,\nbut dominantly enter b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays. The bounds on (\u03b4d23)LR and (\u03b4d23)RL posed by the\ncorresponding branching ratio have been investigated in Ref. [69], a recent update can be\nfound in Ref. [70]. As for the chirality-conserving mass insertions, the impact of the D0\nbound (5) has been studied in Refs. [6, 8]. Here we set all but one mass insertion to 0\nand restrict ourselves to bounds on (\u03b4d23)LL and the impact of a future measurement of \u03c6s\non these bounds.\nThe effective \u2206B = 2 Hamiltonian in the MSSM contains a total of eight operators\nas compared to only one in the SM. The corresponding hadronic matrix elements (bag\nparameters) have been calculated, in quenched approximation, in Ref. [71]. The evolution\nof the Wilson coefficients fromMS, the scale where the SUSY particles are integrated out,\nto mb is known to next-to-leading order [72, 67]. The expression for \u2206Ms in the MSSM\nthen depends onMS, mq\u02dc, the average sfermion mass, and mg\u02dc, the gluonino mass. We take\nmq\u02dc = 500GeV = mg\u02dc and also MS = 500GeV as illustrative values. We then obtain the\nconstraints on Re (\u03b4d23)LL and Im (\u03b4\nd\n23)LL shown in Fig. 12. The closed curves in the centre\nof the plots correspond to the allowed values of the real and imaginary part of (\u03b4d23)LL after\nthe measurement of \u2206Ms; note that the experimental value of \u2206Ms is incompatible with\nthe SM prediction at 1.5 \u03c3 level when the (HP+JL)QCD lattice data are used, Eq. (36),\nhence the origin is excluded in the right panel. The open lines correspond to constraints\nimposed by a measurement of the mixing phase \u03c6s, as explained in the caption. It is\nobvious that at present no value of \u03c6s is excluded and that the precise measurement\nof the mixing phase, expected to take place at the LHC, will considerably restrict the\nparameter space of SUSY mass insertions.\n20\nRe\n(\n\u03b4d23\n)\nLL\nIm\n( \u03b4d 2\n3\n) LL\n-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nRe\n(\n\u03b4d23\n)\nLL\nIm\n( \u03b4d 2\n3\n) LL\nFigure 12: 1 \u03c3 constraints on (\u03b4d23)LL from \u2206Ms (closed lines). Left panel: JLQCD results\n(10), right panel: (HP+JL)QCD results (11). The open lines denote constraints posed by\na measurement of \u03c6s: the curves in the upper right and lower left quadrant correspond,\nfrom bottom to top in the upper quadrant, and top to bottom in the lower quadrant, to\n\u03c6s \u2208 {0\u25e6, 36\u25e6, 72\u25e6, 108\u25e6, 144\u25e6}, whereas those in the upper left and lower right quadrant\ncorrespond to phases between \u2212180\u25e6 and 0\u25e6.\nIf SUSY is found at the LHC, and the gluino and average squark masses are measured,\nthe results from MIA analyses of flavour processes will help to constrain the soft SUSY\nbreaking terms and hence the \u2013 yet to be understood \u2013 mechanism of SUSY breaking.\nGiven the sheer number of these terms (about 100), it will be very difficult to resolve\nthe richness of SUSY breaking from direct SUSY searches alone, which will have to be\ncomplemented by constraints (or measurements) from flavour physics \u2013 which, in turn,\nwill become more expressive, once the direct searches will have provided the relevant mass\nscales.\n6 Conclusions and Outlook\nThe FCNC processes of B0d\u2013B\u00af\n0\nd and B\n0\ns\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing offer interesting probes to search for\nsignals of physics beyond the SM. Although the former phenomenon is well established\nsince many years, the latter has only just been observed at the Tevatron, thereby raising\nin particular the question of the implications for the parameter space of NP.\nThe current situation can be summarized as follows: the experimental value of the\nmass difference \u2206Md and the recently measured \u2206Ms agree with the SM. However, the\nSM predictions of these quantities suffer from large uncertainties. In particular, some lat-\ntice calculations ((HP+JL)QCD) indicate a value of \u2206MSMs that is 1.5 \u03c3 larger than the\nexperimental CDF value, whereas the JLQCD results show no such effect. A similar pat-\ntern arises at the 1 \u03c3 level in the Bd-meson system. In view of these uncertainties, values\n21\nof \u03bad,s, the strength of the NP contributions to Bd,s mixing, as large as 2.5 are still allowed\nby the experimental values of \u2206Md,s, and the new CP-violating phases \u03c3d,s are essentially\nunconstrained. Complementary information is provided by CP violation. Interestingly,\nthe impressive measurement of mixing-induced CP violation in B0d \u2192 J\/\u03c8KS (and similar\nmodes) at the B factories may indicate a small \u2013 but noticeable \u2013 CP-violating NP phase\n\u03c6NPd around \u221210\u25e6, which would have a drastic impact on the allowed region in the \u03c3d\u2013\u03bad\nplane and would result in a lower bound on \u03bad of \u2248 0.2. In any case, the experimentally\nexcluded large values of \u03c6NPd reduce the upper bound \u03bad \u2248 2.5 significantly to 0.5. On\nthe other hand, no information about \u03c6NPs is currently available, so that we are left with\nthe large range of 0 \u223c< \u03bas \u223c< 2.5.\nThe following quantities play a key ro\u02c6le for these studies: mixing:\n\u2022 The CKM parameters \u03b3 and Rb \u221d |Vub\/Vcb|, which enter the analysis of B0d\u2013B\u00af0d mix-\ning in a complementary manner. Whereas the UT angle \u03b3 is currently a significant\nsource of uncertainty for the SM prediction of \u2206Md (and \u2206Ms\/\u2206Md), Rb is crucial\nfor the detection of a NP phase \u03c6NPd . Thanks to the LHCb experiment, the situation\nfor \u03b3 will improve dramatically in the future, where we assumed \u03b3 = (70\u00b15)\u25e6 in our\n2010 benchmark scenario. Concerning Rb, the error of |Vcb| has already a marginal\nimpact. However, there is currently a 1 \u03c3 discrepancy between the inclusive and\nexclusive determinations of |Vub|, pointing towards \u03c6NPd \u2248 \u221210\u25e6 and \u03c6NPd \u2248 0\u25e6, re-\nspectively. Consequently, it is crucial to clarify this situation and to reduce the\nuncertainty of |Vub|. In our benchmark scenario, we assume that the central value of\n|Vub|incl will be confirmed, and that its uncertainty shrinks to 5% due to experimen-\ntal and theoretical progress. It is an advantage of the Bs-meson system that the SM\nanalysis of its mixing parameters is essentially unaffected by CKM uncertainties.\n\u2022 The hadronic parameters fBqB\u02c61\/2Bq , which enter the SM predictions of \u2206Mq. For a\ndetermination of \u03baq with 10% uncertainty, the errors of the (HP+JL)QCD lattice\nresults have to be reduced by a factor of 2. The hadronic uncertainties are smaller\nif one considers the ratio \u2206Ms\/\u2206Md, involving the SU(3)-breaking parameter \u03be.\nPresently, there is no indication of this ratio to deviate from its SM prediction, but\nthere is still a large uncertainty. In our 2010 benchmark scenario, the error from \u03be\nwould match that from \u03b3. Nevertheless, it will probably be challenging to detect\nNP through deviations of \u03c1s\/\u03c1d from 1. Moreover, a result in agreement with 1 does\nnot allow any conclusion about the presence or absence of NP, as \u03c1s and \u03c1d may\nboth deviate similarly from 1, except for excluding certain NP scenarios, like for\ninstance Higgs penguins enhanced by large values of tan\u03b2SUSY.\nConcerning the prospects for the search for NP through B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing at the LHC, it\nwill be very challenging if essentially no CP-violating effects will be found in B0s \u2192 J\/\u03c8\u03c6\n(and similar decays). On the other hand, as we demonstrated in our analysis, even a small\nphase \u03c6NPs \u2248 \u221210\u25e6 (inspired by the Bd data) would lead to CP asymmetries at the \u221220%\nlevel, which could be unambiguously detected after a couple of years of data taking, and\nwould not be affected by hadronic uncertainties. Conversely, the measurement of such an\nasymmetry would allow one to establish lower bounds on the strength of NP contribution\n\u2013 even if hadronic uncertainties still preclude a direct extraction of this contribution from\n\u2206Ms \u2013 and to dramatically reduce the allowed region in the NP parameter space. In fact,\n22\nthe situation may be even more promising, as specific scenarios of NP still allow large\nnew phases in B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing, also after the measurement of \u2206Ms. We have illustrated\nthis exciting feature by considering models with an extra Z \u2032 boson and SUSY scenarios\nwith an approximate alignment of quark and squark masses.\nIn essence, the lesson to be learnt from the CDF measurement of \u2206Ms is that NP\nmay actually be hiding in B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing, but is still obscured by parameter uncertainties,\nsome of which will be reduced by improved statistics at the LHC, whereas others require\ndedicated work of, in particular, lattice theorists. The smoking gun for the presence of\nNP in B0s\u2013B\u00af\n0\ns mixing will be the detection of a non-vanishing value of \u03c6\nNP\ns through CP\nviolation in B0s \u2192 J\/\u03c8\u03c6. Let us finally emphasize that the current B-factory data may\nshow \u2013 in addition to \u03c6NPd \u2248 \u221210\u25e6 \u2013 other first indications of new sources of CP violation\nthrough measurements of B0d \u2192 \u03c6KS and B \u2192 \u03c0K decays, which may point towards a\nmodified electroweak penguin sector. All these examples are yet another demonstration\nthat flavour physics is not an optional extra, but an indispensable ingredient in the pursuit\nof NP, also and in particular in the era of the LHC.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Martin Lu\u00a8scher for a discussion of the current status of lattice\ncalculations of B mixing parameters.\nReferences\n[1] E.
