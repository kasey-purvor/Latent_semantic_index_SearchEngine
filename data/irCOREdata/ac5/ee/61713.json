Introduction 28 \nSince the discovery of the radiation belts in 1958 [Van Allen et al., 1958], a lot of 29 \nprogress has been made in understanding and describing the Earth\u2019s radiation 30 \nenvironment. Scientific and operational satellite data combined with physical simulations 31 \nhave provided a great insight into the dynamics of the charged particle population and the 32 \nphysical processes involved. 33 \nOne of the most important remaining questions is the definition of the physical 34 \nprocesses responsible for the loss and acceleration of relativistic radiation belt electrons. 35 \nDuring conditions of high geomagnetic activity these processes are enhanced causing the 36 \nobserved high variability of high energy electrons especially in the outer radiation belt. 37 \nRelativistic electron fluxes will decrease if losses dominate, but if sources dominate, 38 \nrelativistic electron fluxes will increase, as is observed in approximately half of all 39 \nmoderate and intense geomagnetic storms [Reeves at al., 2003]. The electron variation 40 \ncan be of several orders of magnitude on timescales from hours to days. 41 \nSeveral processes have been proposed to be responsible for the electron energization to 42 \nMeV energies [e.g., Friedel et al., 2002; Horne, 2002]. Radial diffusion was identified 43 \nfrom the beginning as one of the most important [Falthammar, 1965, 1966]. Charged 44 \nparticles are transported inwards (towards the Earth) across magnetic field lines due to 45 \nmagnetic and electric field variations. Due to the conservation of the first adiabatic 46 \ninvariant (the particle\u2019s magnetic moment) particles moving towards regions of stronger 47 \nmagnetic field become more energetic. For equatorial particles the relationship between 48 \nthe energy of the particle and L- the distance (in Earth radii) of a magnetic field line from 49 \nthe center of the Earth at the equator [McIlwain, 1961]-  is given by: 50 \n 4\n 51 \n( ) ( ) 3202231011 *2*2 LEEELEEE +=+                   (1) 52 \n 53 \nwhere E1 and L1 are the initial energy and distance (from the center of the Earth, in Earth 54 \nradii) of the particle and E2 and L2 are the final energy and distance of the particle. E0 is 55 \nthe rest energy of the electron which is equal to 0.511 MeV. In addition, enhanced ULF 56 \nwave activity in the outer electron radiation belt has been associated with enhanced radial 57 \ndiffusion during high magnetic activity conditions [O\u2019Brien et al., 2001; Elkington et al., 58 \n1999]. 59 \nHowever, numerous recent studies have shown that radial diffusion alone cannot 60 \nexplain all the temporal and spatial flux variations observed [Reeves et al., 1998; 61 \nBrautigam and Albert, 2000; Obara et al., 2000; Miyoshi et al., 2003; Horne et al., 62 \n2003b; Green and Kivelson, 2004; Horne et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006; Fox et al., 2006; 63 \nIles et al., 2006; Miyoshi et al., 2006; Shprits et al., 2006c; Chen et al., 2007]. Brautigam 64 \nand Albert [2000] studied the October 9, 1991 storm using CRRES data. When they tried 65 \nto reproduce the measured fluxes with a simple radial diffusion physical model their 66 \nresults underestimated relativistic electron fluxes around L = 4-4.5 and the flux increase 67 \nduring the recovery phase was not well represented by the model. From the data analysis 68 \nthey also observed outward radial diffusion from L = 4-5 during the recovery phase. The 69 \nsame storm was selected by Horne et al. [2003b] who studied the electron pitch angle 70 \ndistribution and found it to be energy dependent.  71 \nMiyoshi et al. [2006] used the 4D relativistic RAM electron model [Jordanova et al., 72 \n1996, 2003; Jordanova and Miyoshi, 2005] to simulate the energetic electron dynamics 73 \n 5\nduring the October 2001 storm. Their results showed that radial diffusion, the only 74 \nmechanism included in the model for relativistic energies (E>300 keV), was not 75 \nsufficient to reproduce the observations. They concluded that an additional mechanism is 76 \nneeded to explain high energy electron enhancements during the storm\u2019s recovery phase. 77 \nReeves et al. [1998], studied the global response of relativistic radiation belt electrons 78 \nto the January 1997 magnetic cloud using data from LANL geosynchronous, GOES, 79 \nGPS, POLAR, SAMPEX and HEO and showed that fluxes increased first near L = 4 and 80 \nthen at geosynchronous orbit, at L = 6.6.    81 \nGreen and Kivelson [2004] in their study using POLAR data showed phase space 82 \ndensity expressed data as a function of L* and time for off-equatorial MeV electrons 83 \nwhere a local peak appears near L* = 4-5 during the recovery phase. Similar phase space 84 \ndensity profiles were found by Chen et al. [2006, 2007] at the equator from combining 85 \nPOLAR, LANL geosynchronous and GPS data. Developing peaks in the electron phase 86 \nspace density were also found in the region 4 < L* < 5.5 during relativistic electron flux 87 \nenhancements observed by the CRRES satellite [Iles et al., 2006]. 88 \nAll the above results indicate that radial diffusion is not the only mechanism acting on 89 \nradiation belt electrons in the outer belt and that a local source is acting which dominates 90 \nother processes in the L = 4-5 region.  91 \nMany theoretical, observational and modeling studies have shown that the most 92 \nprobable mechanism acting locally as a high energy electron source is the resonant 93 \ninteraction of electrons with whistler-mode chorus waves leading to energy diffusion of 94 \nlower energy particles to higher energy. The in situ wave-particle heating mechanism was 95 \ntheoretically discussed decades ago [Kennel and Engelmann, 1966; Kennel, 1969; Lyons, 96 \n 6\n1974] and agrees well with the scenario first proposed by Thorne et al. [1974] of 97 \nimportant energy diffusion occurring outside the plasmasphere during active geomagnetic 98 \ntimes when whistler-mode waves are present. More recently, Horne and Thorne [1998] 99 \nstudied different types of electromagnetic waves present in the magnetosphere to estimate 100 \nthe effect these waves could have on the trapped electron population. Whistler-mode 101 \nwaves in the low density environment outside the plasmasphere were found to be good 102 \ncandidates for electron acceleration to MeV energies from in situ energy diffusion of 103 \nlower energy particles. Following theoretical studies also demonstrated that cyclotron and 104 \nLandau resonances with whistler-mode chorus waves were the most probable mechanism 105 \nto produce local acceleration to MeV energies [Summers et al., 1998; Horne et al., 2003a; 106 \nGlauert and Horne, 2005].  107 \nObservational evidence for chorus-driven electron acceleration to relativistic energies 108 \nhas been mostly provided by CRRES data studies where both particle and plasma wave 109 \ndata were provided [Meredith et al., 2002a,b, 2003a].  Meredith et al. [2003a] studied 26 110 \ngeomagnetically disturbed periods and clearly showed the correlation between high levels 111 \nof lower-band chorus activity and relativistic electron enhancements in the outer radiation 112 \nbelt. Similar studies are currently being performed using POLAR particle and wave data 113 \n[Kristine Sigsbee, GEM 2007 poster and personal communication].      114 \nApart from theoretical and observational evidence for chorus-driven electron 115 \nacceleration to MeV energies, recent radiation belt 2D and 3D modeling efforts have 116 \nfocused on this topic also. Varotsou et al. [2005] presented the first results from 3D 117 \nsimulations with the Salammb\u00f4 physical model [Beutier and Boscher, 1995; Bourdarie et 118 \nal., 1996] including both radial diffusion and energy diffusion due to electron-chorus 119 \n 7\nresonant interactions. The simulations showed that when electron-chorus resonant 120 \ninteractions are included in the simulation, an initial seed population of electrons with 121 \ncharacteristic plasmasheet energy of 5 keV can be locally accelerated to MeV energies in 122 \nthe outer belt near geosynchronous orbit.    123 \nIn a two dimensional study by Albert and Young [2005] the diffusion equation was 124 \nsolved for energy and pitch angle diffusion due to chorus waves including the cross 125 \ndiffusion terms. The authors found that at L = 4.5 phase space density was strongly 126 \ndiffusing from 0.2 MeV up to a few MeV in less than a day. 127 \nRecently, Li et al. (2007) used the 2D UCLA radiation belt model, including energy 128 \nand pitch-angle diffusion at a fixed L value and showed that the net effect of electron-129 \nchorus resonant interactions- including both dayside and night side parallel propagating 130 \nchorus- is the local acceleration of relativistic electrons. The local increase of MeV fluxes 131 \nduring the recovery phase of a simulated storm persisted even after they introduced 132 \nstrong losses due to EMIC waves and plasmaspheric hiss.    133 \nIn this paper we present a more detailed study that follows the first results presented by 134 \nVarotsou et al. [2005]. We use the 3D Salammb\u00f4 code to test the effect of each process 135 \n(loss, acceleration, diffusion) on the flux and phase space density (PSD) profiles of 136 \nrelativistic electrons.  The goal of our study is to investigate how different physical 137 \nprocesses acting on the electrons influence the radiation belt dynamics. The study is 138 \nperformed for idealistic dynamic test-cases by using a physical model. The advantage of 139 \nusing a physical model is that we can \u2018turn on\u2019 or \u2018turn off\u2019 one of these processes to 140 \nidentify its effect on the radiation belt dynamics. We are not trying to reproduce satellite 141 \nobservations during a storm period at this point. More realistic simulations, using the 142 \n 8\nactual Kp variation and a boundary condition from geosynchronous measurements and 143 \nincluding high latitude chorus and EMIC waves, are being performed and will be 144 \npresented in a following paper. 145 \nThe outline of the paper is as follows. The Salammb\u00f4 3D model for radiation belt 146 \nelectrons is described in Section 2 and in Section 3 the diffusion coefficients for the 147 \nelectron-chorus interactions are presented together with the method we followed to 148 \nintroduce them into the code. The steady state and dynamic simulations are presented in 149 \nSection 4, followed by a parametric study for several key parameters in Section 5. In 150 \nSection 6 we discuss the limitations of the present study and our future goals, and in 151 \nSection 7 we summarize the results and conclusions of our study.  152 \n 153 \n2. The Salammb\u00f4 3D electron model 154 \nThe development of the Salammb\u00f4 3D code for the Earth\u2019s radiation belts started in the 155 \n1990s at ONERA in Toulouse, France and continues until today [Beutier and Boscher, 156 \n1995; Beutier et al., 1995; Bourdarie et al., 1996; Vacaresse et al., 1999; Varotsou et al., 157 \n2005; Maget et al., 2007]. There are two versions of the code, one for protons and one for 158 \nelectrons since the physical processes involved are different in each case. Beutier and 159 \nBoscher [1995] first presented the electron physical model based on a Fokker-Planck 160 \ndiffusion equation solved in the (M,J,L*) phase space, where M is the first adiabatic 161 \ninvariant, the particle\u2019s magnetic moment, J is the second adiabatic invariant related to 162 \nthe particle\u2019s bounce motion and L* is the Roederer parameter [Roederer, 1970], related 163 \nto the third adiabatic invariant \u03a6 by *2 0\n2 LB\u03c0\u03b1=\u03a6  (where \u03b1 is the Earth\u2019s mean 164 \nradius and B0 is the equatorial magnetic field magnitude at the Earth\u2019s surface). Physical 165 \n 9\nprocesses included were: radial diffusion, frictional processes by Coulomb interactions 166 \nwith plasmaspheric cold electrons, pitch angle diffusion by Coulomb interactions with 167 \natoms and molecules of the high atmosphere and pitch angle diffusion by wave-particle 168 \nresonant interactions inside the plasmasphere. This version of the code was used by 169 \nBourdarie et al. [1996] in their effort to simulate the dynamics of radiation belt electrons 170 \nduring a magnetic storm.  171 \nThe current version of the Salammb\u00f4 3D code solves the Fokker-Planck equation to 172 \nestimate electron PSD in the (E,y,L*) space, where E is the particle\u2019s kinetic energy, y is 173 \nthe sine of the particle\u2019s equatorial pitch angle, \u03b1eq, and L* is the Roederer parameter. The 174 \ndiffusion equation then translates to the following 175 \n 176 \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u2202\n\u2202\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202\nE\nfaD\nEay\nfDyyT\nyyyTL\nf\nL\nD\nL\nL\nt\nf\nEEyy\nLL 1)(\n)(\n1\n***\n* 2\n2  177 \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 f\ndt\ndEa\nEa\n1                                                                (2) 178 \n 179 \nwhere the terms on the right hand side express radial diffusion, pitch angle diffusion 180 \n(where T(y) is an auxiliary function occurring in the bounce frequency expression), 181 \nenergy diffusion (where ( ) ( )[ ] 2\/100 2EEEEEa ++= , E0 the electron rest energy) and 182 \nlosses due to friction, respectively. Radial diffusion is assumed under constant first and 183 \nsecond adiabatic invariants on one grid. Pitch angle diffusion occurs under constant 184 \nenergy and L* and energy diffusion is considered under constant pitch-angle and L* on a 185 \nsecond grid. Interpolation methods are used between the two grids. We use logarithmic 186 \ngrids in energy and L* and a uniform grid in pitch angle. No cross diffusion terms are 187 \n 10\nincluded in the current version of the code. The introduction of cross diffusion terms is a 188 \ndifficult task which is under study and development [Albert and Young, 2005]. The 189 \nmagnetic field used in Salammb\u00f4 is a dipolar, tilted and eccentric field. 190 \nThe physical processes that drive radial, pitch angle and energy diffusion in the 191 \nSalammb\u00f4 code are described in Table 1 (see also diagram in Figure 1 of Maget et al., 192 \n2007). The fourth and fifth columns indicate which calculation and which parameters 193 \nwere used for the definition of the diffusion coefficients. Note here that radial diffusion 194 \ncoefficients are different from the ones used by Varotsou et al. [2005]. 195 \nInside the plasmasphere, particles interact with hiss, VLF transmitters and lightning-196 \ngenerated whistlers. Outside the plasmasphere, particles interact with whistler-mode 197 \nchorus waves. In this paper we mainly focus on the region outside the plasmapause where 198 \nboth radial diffusion and chorus waves occur (for more details on the plasmasphere and 199 \ninner belt region refer to Beutier and Boscher [1995]). 200 \nIn addition to these diffusive processes, particle energy loss by Coulomb interactions 201 \nwith cold plasmaspheric electrons and bound electrons of atoms and molecules of the 202 \nhigh atmosphere are considered. This process is expressed by the frictional term in the 203 \ndiffusion equation (2). However, interactions with the high atmosphere don\u2019t have a 204 \nsignificant effect on outer radiation belt electron dynamics, so we will not be analyzing 205 \nthis physical process in any detail (for more details see Beutier and Boscher [1995]). 206 \nIn the code, the temporal evolution of PSD is determined by the temporal evolution of 207 \nthe coefficients introduced in the diffusion equation (2). Radial diffusion coefficients and 208 \npitch angle and energy diffusion coefficients due to chorus interactions outside the 209 \nplasmasphere are expressed as a function of geomagnetic activity through the Kp index 210 \n 11\nwhich is time dependent. Furthermore, the position of the plasmapause, which separates 211 \nthe regions where plasmaspheric waves and chorus operate, is also Kp dependent 212 \n[Carpenter and Park, 1973]. The intensity of plasmaspheric waves is considered to be 213 \nconstant (not activity dependent) in Salammb\u00f4 (see Discussion section). The expressions 214 \nused for the diffusion coefficients together with the boundary conditions and our solving 215 \nscheme of equation (2) will be described in the following Sections.  216 \n 217 \n3. Electron \u2013 chorus resonant interactions 218 \n3.1 Diffusion coefficients from PADIE 219 \nPitch angle, Dyy, and energy diffusion, DEE, coefficients for cyclotron resonant electron 220 \n- chorus interactions have been estimated from the PADIE code [Glauert and Horne, 221 \n2005]. The calculation is done using the quasi-linear assumption and is fully relativistic.  222 \nIn the calculation, distributions of wave power and wave normal angles are assumed to 223 \nbe Gaussian [e.g. Lyons, 1974]. The wave distribution is considered to peak along the 224 \nmagnetic field direction with an angular spread of 30 degrees. Landau and \u00b1 5 cyclotron 225 \nharmonic resonances are included in the calculation and waves are assumed to be 226 \nconfined near the equator at magnetic latitudes of -150 < \u03bbm < 150. The conditions and 227 \nparameters used for the calculation are the same as those used by Varotsou et al. [2005], 228 \npresented here in Table 2. These values are based on wave observations from the Plasma 229 \nWave Experiment [Anderson et al., 1992] on board the CRRES spacecraft [Glauert and 230 \nHorne, 2005]. 231 \nBounce averaged diffusion coefficients Dyy and DEE are calculated by the PADIE code 232 \nas a matrix with a constant wave amplitude of Bw = 100nT for electron plasma frequency 233 \n 12\nto electron cyclotron frequency ratio (fpe\/fce) values of 1.5, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10, electron 234 \nenergies of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 MeV, and L values of 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5, 235 \nwith a resolution of less than 1 degree equatorial pitch angle. Diffusion coefficients are 236 \nset to zero for energies E < 0.01 MeV and E > 3 MeV and for L values L < 2.5 and L > 237 \n6.5. For fpe\/fce < 1.5 and fpe\/fce > 10 diffusion coefficients are assumed constant and 238 \nequal to their values for fpe\/fce = 1.5 and fpe\/fce = 10, respectively. 239 \n 240 \n3.2 Introduction of Dyy, DEE in Salammb\u00f4  241 \nThe diffusion coefficients were related to magnetic activity by constructing a statistical 242 \nwave model where equatorial values (-150 < \u03bbm < 150) of fpe\/fce and wave intensity Bwave2 243 \nmeasured by CRRES  were parameterized for Kp < 2, 2 \u2264 Kp \u2264 4 and Kp \u2265 4 between L = 244 \n1 to 7, with a resolution of 0.1L and 1 hour in MLT [Meredith et al., 2003b]. The 245 \ncoefficient values from the matrix given by PADIE were interpolated to energy, pitch 246 \nangle and L values corresponding to the Salammb\u00f4 grid and to fpe\/fce values 247 \ncorresponding to the ones given from the statistical wave model (CRRES data). 248 \nFor a given energy, L, pitch angle and Kp, the diffusion coefficients were calculated in 249 \neach MLT bin according to fpe\/fce and Bwave2. Finally, for introduction in the Salammb\u00f4 250 \ncode, we calculated the coefficients\u2019 drift average by summing values over all MLT and 251 \ndividing by the number of MLT bins. Since electron-chorus interactions are most 252 \nefficient for low fpe\/fce and high wave intensities [Meredith et al., 2003b], they were 253 \nonly included in the model outside the plasmasphere. 254 \nAn example of the bounce and drift averaged diffusion coefficients is presented in 255 \nFigure 1 for L* = 4.8. The first column shows the energy diffusion coefficients as a 256 \n 13\nfunction of energy and equatorial pitch angle for the three different Kp categories and the 257 \nsecond column shows the same dependence for the pitch angle diffusion coefficients. 258 \nSome important conclusions can be drawn from Figure 1: a) both coefficients increase 259 \nwhen geomagnetic activity (Kp) increases, b) for high energies both coefficients obtain 260 \nhigher values at higher pitch angles, thus acceleration will be more important near the 261 \nequator and no high energy electron losses due to diffusion in the loss cone (low 262 \nequatorial pitch angle values) by chorus waves will occur, and c) pitch angle diffusion for 263 \nthe low energy particles near the loss cone will be fast, thus these particles will 264 \nexperience important losses due to the interaction with chorus waves.  265 \n 266 \n4. Test-case simulations 267 \nWe solve the diffusion equation (2), using an explicit finite difference scheme, in the E, y 268 \n(=sin\u03b1eq), L* space in a rectangular domain with 25 nodes in each direction (we chose the 269 \nnumber of nodes for a fast execution since the time step of our calculations is limited by 270 \nthe Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition [Courant et al., 1967]). The simulation domain in 271 \nSalammb\u00f4 extends for energies from 0.1 keV to 5 MeV, pitch angles from 2 degrees to 272 \n90 degrees (the lower limit for the equatorial pitch angle, under which electrons are lost 273 \nin the upper atmosphere, is calculated in the model for each L* shell- it doesn\u2019t take 274 \nvalues of less than 20) and L* shells from 1 to 8. Since electron-chorus interactions are 275 \nintroduced in the code for energies from 10 keV to 3 MeV and L* values from outside the 276 \nplasmapause to 6.5 and since our goal is to test if these interactions can lead to electron 277 \nacceleration to MeV energies, the domain of interest in this study, on which we will 278 \nfocus, is for E > 0.5 MeV and L* > 3. 279 \n 14\nThe boundary conditions we impose for the solution of the diffusion equation are the 280 \nfollowing 281 \n 282 \n                      )()( minmin EfEf bound=            0)( max =Ef  283 \n                      0)( min =eqf \u03b1                        0\/)( max =\u2202\u2202= \u03b1\u03b1 ff eq  284 \n                   0)*( min =Lf             )()*( max EfLf bound=  285 \n 286 \nwhere fbound is the outer boundary condition (only a function of electron energy) we 287 \nimpose at L* = 8, which constitutes the source of electrons in the simulation. In our 288 \ncurrent study this condition is constant with time (a time varying boundary is currently 289 \nbeing studied and will be presented in a future paper). With the above boundary 290 \nconditions we consider that: a) the lowest energy PSD- at the outer boundary- stays 291 \nconstant and there is an absence of multi-MeV energies, b) the loss cone is empty and the 292 \npitch angle particle distribution at the equator is flat, and c) losses dominate at L* = 1 and 293 \nthe source at L* = 8 is constant and given by the fbound boundary condition. 294 \nThe boundary condition at L* = 8 is defined to be a kappa distribution [Christon et al., 295 \n1991] given by the formula 296 \n 297 \n1\n0\n1\n\u2212\u2212\n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n+=\nk\nbound kE\nEAf                                (3) 298 \n 299 \nwhere we take A = 1035 MeV-3s-3, defined by examining a long period of LANL 300 \ngeosynchronous measurements, E0 = 2 keV (plasmasheet characteristic energy) , defined 301 \n 15\nby average LANL geosynchronous MPA (Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzer) data 302 \n[Joseph Borovsky private communication 2007] and k = 5, based on Christon et al. [1988, 303 \n1991]. Note here that Varotsou et al. [2005] used a kappa distribution with a 304 \ncharacteristic energy of 5 keV, considering a higher energy spectrum at the source. 305 \n  Finally, to help the reader follow the work and results presented in the following 306 \nSections we summarize in Table 3 the physical processes involved in radiation belt 307 \ndynamics outside the plasmasphere in Salammb\u00f4, together with the expressions of the 308 \ncoefficients introduced in the diffusion equation (2) and the simulation domain where 309 \neach process is included. The plasmapause position is defined by the empirical 310 \nexpression Lpp = 5.6 \u2013 0.46Kp\u2019 [Carpenter and Park, 1973], where Kp\u2019 is the highest 311 \nvalue of the Kp index during the last 24 hours of the simulation. 312 \n 313 \n4.1. Steady state 314 \nFirst we present the results obtained for a steady state of the radiation belts. There is no 315 \ndynamics and no time dependence involved here. This permits us to detect the effect 316 \nelectron-chorus interactions have on the radiation belt electrons when we include them in 317 \nour simulation scheme. In addition, the initial state for the dynamic simulation is defined 318 \nfrom the output of this steady state simulation.  319 \nIn the steady-state simulation, the diffusion equation (2) is solved for \u2202f\/\u2202t = 0. The 320 \nsteady state is defined for a certain geomagnetic activity level, i.e., for a given Kp value. 321 \nWhen we fix Kp to a constant value, radial diffusion coefficients depend only on L*, 322 \nwhile pitch angle and energy diffusion coefficients depend on energy, pitch angle and L*, 323 \nand the plasmapause is fixed to a certain L* shell. 324 \n 16\nRadiation belts are considered to initially be empty everywhere except at the outer 325 \nboundary (L* = 8) where the source is defined by equation (3). After many iterations, the 326 \nsystem reaches a steady state and the calculated phase space densities represent the state 327 \nof the radiation belts after a long period of steady conditions.  328 \nWe run the code for Kp = 1.3 to use the output as an initial state of calm conditions for 329 \nour dynamic simulation. To investigate the effect of electron-chorus resonant interactions 330 \non the electron distribution we performed one simulation including this process and one 331 \nwithout it. The results are presented in Figures 2, 3 and 5. 332 \n 333 \n4.1.1. PSD variation as a function of L shell 334 \nIn Figure 2, phase space densities are presented as a function of L* shell and iteration 335 \nnumber for a constant magnetic moment value of M = 2100 MeV\/G and for equatorial 336 \nmirroring particles (\u03b1eq = 90 degrees). The plasmapause position is marked with a white 337 \nline.  338 \nIn these type of plots, energy increases as we move inwards to lower L* shells. For M = 339 \n2100 MeV\/G, we are studying ~1 MeV electrons at L* ~ 6 and ~2 MeV electrons at L* ~ 340 \n4.5. We choose to represent results in a (M, \u03b1eq) = constant space instead of a (M, J) = 341 \nconstant space (where J is the second adiabatic invariant) because we want to be able to 342 \ndistinguish between different processes affecting the electron distribution. In addition, \u03b1eq 343 \n= constant is not that different from J = constant. 344 \nFigure 2(a) shows results when electron-chorus interactions are included in the 345 \nsimulation together with radial diffusion. First, particles are transported inwards (in the 346 \ninitially empty radiation belts) from the outer boundary by radial diffusion and then they 347 \n 17\nare accelerated by chorus waves resulting to the formation of a peak in the PSD 348 \ndistribution at L* ~ 5-6. Then, phase space density at surrounding L* shells (lower than 5 349 \nand higher than 6) increases due to radial diffusion diffusing particles away from the 350 \npeak. As a result, phase space density increases inside the plasmasphere and outside L* = 351 \n6.5, regions where electron-chorus interactions are not considered in the simulation. 352 \nIn contrast, in Figure 2(b), where results with only radial diffusion included in the 353 \nsimulation are shown, there is no peak forming in the PSD distribution in L* shell. 354 \nParticles are only diffused inwards forming a flat PSD distribution. The maximum 355 \ndifference in the PSD values between the two steady states is observed at L* = 5.5 and is 356 \nequal to two orders of magnitude. These kinds of increases have been observed at 357 \ngeosynchronous and GPS orbits [Chen et al., 2007].  358 \n 359 \n4.1.2. PSD variation as a function of equatorial pitch angle 360 \nIn Figure 3, results from the two simulations (with and without chorus waves) are 361 \npresented for comparison as a function of equatorial pitch angle for L* = 5.2 and for E = 362 \n1.7 MeV. We choose to present results with respect to energy, equatorial pitch angle and 363 \nL* values to confirm that introduction of electron-chorus interactions in a 3D particle 364 \nsimulation leads to energy diffusion, i.e., acceleration of electrons to MeV energies. 365 \nWhen electron-chorus resonant interactions are introduced in the simulation we observe 366 \nan increase in the PSD level. This increase is greater for equatorial pitch angles of 50 367 \ndegrees and higher. Flat top pitch angle distributions like this are a signature of chorus 368 \nwave acceleration and have been observed by the CRRES satellite (Horne et al., 2003b). 369 \n 18\nThe profile of the red curve (when chorus waves are included in the simulation) can be 370 \nexplained if we look at the profile of the energy and pitch angle diffusion coefficients as a 371 \nfunction of equatorial pitch angle. Both coefficients are plotted in Figure 4 for the same 372 \nparameters as in Figure 3. Energy diffusion coefficients obtain maximum and almost 373 \nsteady values for equatorial pitch angles between 60 and 90 degrees. For \u03b1eq < 60 374 \ndegrees, DEE decreases very fast with decreasing pitch angle, becoming one order of 375 \nmagnitude smaller every ~10 degrees. Pitch angle diffusion coefficients are higher in the 376 \nregion of 50-70 degrees. Their role is to diffuse equatorial particles to lower pitch angle 377 \nvalues. Thus, PSD values increase for all equatorial pitch angles (red curve in Figure 3).  378 \nIn general we conclude that the effect of introducing chorus waves in our simulations is 379 \nmost important for equatorial particles, down to a value of \u03b1eq~50 degrees. This is related 380 \nto our initial hypothesis that chorus waves are confined near the equator (see Discussion 381 \nsection). 382 \n 383 \n4.1.3. PSD variation as a function of energy 384 \nFinally, in Figure 5, results are presented as a function of energy for L* = 5.2 and for 385 \nequatorial particles (\u03b1eq=90 degrees). As in the previous figures, results from the 386 \nsimulation with electron-chorus interactions (red curve) and without (blue curve) are 387 \ncompared. When chorus waves are included, energy diffusion- by which lower energy 388 \nelectrons are accelerated to higher energies- becomes very important. Higher energy 389 \nphase space densities increase significantly, while lower energy (less than 30 keV) phase 390 \nspace densities decrease. As an example, 600 keV and 1.7 MeV electron phase space 391 \n 19\ndensities increase by more than 2 orders of magnitude while ~ 20 keV electron PSD 392 \nbecomes 2 times smaller.  393 \nIn reality we don\u2019t see low energies decreasing while higher ones increase. The 394 \ndecrease of the low energy phase space densities is an artifact of our simulations since we 395 \nare considering a constant outer source and convection is not included in the simulation. 396 \nObservations show that times of enhanced chorus activity coincide with times of 397 \nenhanced injections and substorm activity [Meredith et al., 2001, 2002a, 2003a]. Thus, 398 \nthe low energy source increases during these times. 399 \n 400 \n4.2 Dynamic simulation 401 \nDuring high geomagnetic activity conditions, variations in the trapped electron 402 \ndistribution can be important and in many cases very fast. Modeling these variations 403 \nrequires a good understanding of the physical processes involved in radiation belt- and 404 \nmagnetospheric- dynamics.  405 \nHere, the goal is to expand the study on the combined effect of radial diffusion and 406 \nelectron-chorus resonant interactions presented by Varotsou et al. [2005]. We have 407 \nsimulated a simple test-case where Kp varies step-wise from a low initial value to a 408 \nhigher one and then back to the initial one. The Kp profile for this simulation is shown in 409 \nFigure 6. We chose Kp to be initially equal to 1.3 to simulate calm conditions. This initial 410 \nstate is the steady state calculated in the previous section. Then, Kp becomes equal to 4 411 \nfor one day and finally it returns to its initial low value. Next, we will focus on the 412 \nevolution of the electron distributions from time T1 (initial state) to time T2 (state after 1 413 \nday of Kp = 4) shown in Figure 6.  414 \n 20\n 415 \n4.2.1. PSD as a function of L shell   416 \nWhen Kp increases, both radial diffusion and electron-chorus interactions are enhanced. 417 \nTo identify which process is responsible for the dynamics observed we perform three 418 \nsimulations: one where both radial diffusion and chorus interactions are included, one 419 \nwhere we \u2018turn off\u2019 radial diffusion and one where we \u2018turn off\u2019 electron-chorus 420 \ninteractions. The initial state used is the same for all simulations. The results from the 421 \nthree simulations at time T2 are plotted in Figure 7. In this figure, phase space densities 422 \nare plotted versus L* shell for equatorial particles with magnetic moment equal to 2100 423 \nMeV\/G. Also marked (vertical dashed lines) is the plasmapause position for Kp = 1.3 and 424 \nKp = 4. 425 \nWhen we \u2018turn off\u2019 radial diffusion, interactions with chorus waves are the only process 426 \nacting on radiation belt electrons outside the plasmasphere. As a result, at time T2 phase 427 \nspace densities increase significantly creating a very pronounced peak at L* = 5.7. This 428 \nincrease is confined in the region where chorus waves are defined in our simulation (Lpp 429 \n< L* < 6.5) and is maximal in the L* = 5-6 region (increase of more than 2 orders of 430 \nmagnitude).  431 \nWhen we \u2018turn off\u2019 electron-chorus interactions, radial diffusion is the only process 432 \nacting on electrons outside the plasmasphere. In this case, at time T2 phase space 433 \ndensities decrease at higher L* shells (L* > 4.5) and increase at lower L* shells. This is the 434 \nresult of particles diffusing away from the peak that already exists in the initial state. 435 \nDuring high activity conditions, enhanced outward radial diffusion from the peak- at L* ~ 436 \n5- towards higher L* results in the decrease of PSD since particles are lost at the boundary 437 \n 21\n(which stays constant in our simulation). Inward radial diffusion is weaker, but we can 438 \nsee a small increase in PSD at L* < 4.5.  439 \nFinally, when both processes are included in the simulation, the localized effect of 440 \nchorus waves is diffused by radial diffusion to all L* shells. The peak value decreases 441 \nwhile values around the peak increase. This increase is more important at higher L* shells 442 \nwhere radial diffusion is stronger, resulting at an important increase of PSD in the region 443 \nwhere chorus waves are not considered in the simulation (L* > 6.5) [Varotsou et al., 444 \n2005]. However, the most important increase in the PSD-L* distribution- more than an 445 \norder of magnitude- is observed near L* = 5-6 (E = 1-2 MeV).   446 \n 447 \n4.2.2. PSD as a function of equatorial pitch angle and energy          448 \nIn Figure 8, results from all three simulations (\u2018turning off\u2019 chorus, \u2018turning off\u2019 radial 449 \ndiffusion and including both processes) are plotted versus equatorial pitch angle at L* = 450 \n5.2 and for E = 1.7 MeV particles. At this L* we position ourselves at the peak of the 451 \nPSD distribution as shown in Figure 7 (red line). 452 \nResults agree well with those presented in Figure 7. Radial diffusion, when acting 453 \nalone, diffuses particles away from the peak in the initial PSD-L* distribution decreasing 454 \nPSD at the peak location. This process is equally strong at all equatorial pitch angles- 455 \nsince the DLL coefficients do not depend on \u03b1eq- but its effect depends also on \u2202f\/\u2202L at 456 \neach \u03b1eq value.  457 \nWhen chorus interactions is the only process acting, PSD increases by a factor of ~ 100 458 \nfor \u03b1eq > 40 degrees. Energy and pitch angle diffusion are much weaker at low equatorial 459 \npitch angles for MeV electrons (see Figure 1 and 4). 460 \n 22\nWhen both processes are taken into account, radial diffusion weakens the effect of 461 \nchorus waves for \u03b1eq > 30 degrees by diffusing particles away from the peak created by 462 \nchorus interactions. However it is obvious that chorus interactions dominate over radial 463 \ndiffusion at \u03b1eq > 30 degrees and the overall result is a net increase of electron PSD (more 464 \nthan an order of magnitude) for these pitch angle values outside the plasmasphere. 465 \nIn Figure 9, PSD is plotted versus energy (from 0.5 to 5 MeV) and equatorial pitch 466 \nangle for L* = 5.2 at times T1 and T2. Phase space densities have greatly increased at time 467 \nT2 at the MeV energy range for \u03b1eq > 30 degrees in agreement with the results presented 468 \nin Figure 8. However at lower pitch angle values no increase is observed for the MeV 469 \nparticles. To understand this behavior better we plot in Figure 10 for Kp = 4, as a function 470 \nof energy, (a) pitch angle diffusion coefficients Dyy for \u03b1eq = 85 degrees (solid line) and 471 \n\u03b1eq = 30 degrees (dash dot line) and (b) energy diffusion coefficients DEE for \u03b1eq = 90 472 \ndegrees (solid line) and \u03b1eq = 30 degrees (dash dot line).  473 \nFor \u03b1eq = 70-90 degrees we do not expect pitch angle diffusion to play an important 474 \nrole, since, as it is noted in Section 4.1, the initial pitch angle distribution at T1 is flat near 475 \nthese values. In this region, energy diffusion is principally responsible for the dynamics 476 \nobserved especially at higher energies as can be seen in Figure 10(b) for \u03b1eq = 90 degrees. 477 \nAt \u03b1eq = 30 degrees the coefficient\u2019s values are very different from those at 90 degrees. 478 \nFigure 10(b) shows that energy diffusion coefficients for high energy electrons become 479 \n103 times weaker (even more in some cases). As a result, the increase of high energy 480 \nphase space densities in Figure 9 is much weaker at \u03b1eq ~ 30 degrees than at higher ones.  481 \n 482 \n4.2.3. Fluxes 483 \n 23\nSince PSD is not a physical quantity that is measured by satellites, we show here our 484 \nresults for the dynamic test-case simulation including both radial diffusion and electron-485 \nchorus interactions as fluxes. In Figure 11, omnidirectional fluxes at the equator are 486 \nshown in an L*-time space for 1.6 MeV. The plasmapause location is shown with a green 487 \nline and the Kp variation with time is shown on the top of the figure.  488 \nOnce again we clearly observe the electron acceleration due to chorus interactions: 489 \nMeV fluxes increase in the heart of the radiation belts when activity increases. After 1 490 \nday of Kp = 4 fluxes become 24 times higher at L* = 5.7 and 15 times higher at L = 6.6. 491 \nWhen Kp recovers to its initial low value, MeV fluxes keep increasing at L* > 6 due to 492 \nradial diffusion. After the plasmapause relaxes to its initial position MeV fluxes inside 493 \nthe plasmasphere decrease slowly. 494 \n 495 \n5. Parametric study 496 \nIn Sections 3 and 4 we presented the results of simulations including chorus 497 \ninteractions in the Salammb\u00f4 3D code. The results showed clearly that a low energy seed 498 \npopulation can be locally accelerated by chorus waves to MeV energies in the heart of the 499 \nradiation belts near L* = 5. However, many of the parameters used in the simulations are 500 \nquite uncertain, thus it is important to perform a parametric study where the sensitivity of 501 \nthe results to the parameter\u2019s values can be quantified. Here we examine how results 502 \nchange if we consider different values for three of the important parameters: 1) radial 503 \ndiffusion coefficients, 2) initial state condition and 3) source condition at L* = 8.  504 \n 505 \n5.1. Radial diffusion coefficients 506 \n 24\nThe accurate definition of radial diffusion coefficients constitutes one of the most 507 \nimportant projects in radiation belt physics. Although many efforts have been made to 508 \ncalculate them empirically [Lanzerotti et al., 1970; Lanzerotti and Morgan, 1973; 509 \nHolzworth and Mozer, 1979; Brautigam and Albert, 2000; Li, 2004] and theoretically 510 \n[Falthammar, 1965, 1966; Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974; Brizard and Chan, 2001; Perry 511 \net al., 2005], there is still a lot of uncertainty concerning their dependence in L, energy, 512 \npitch angle and magnetic activity.  513 \nAs noted in previous sections, the result of the simulation performed using both radial 514 \ndiffusion and chorus interactions depends on the relative intensity of the two processes. If 515 \nradial diffusion coefficients had lower values than the ones used here [Brautigam and 516 \nAlbert, 2000] then the effect of chorus waves on the electron distribution would be even 517 \nmore important. Here we examine how results change if we consider higher radial 518 \ndiffusion coefficient values.  519 \nTo investigate the influence of the radial diffusion coefficient\u2019s uncertainty on our 520 \nresults we perform two simulations, increasing DLL by a factor of three and six, 521 \nrespectively. The results of both simulations for the steady case are plotted in Figure 522 \n12(a), together with the previous result- with the nominal Brautigam and Albert [2000] 523 \ncoefficient values. The steady case simulation is for Kp = 1.3 and for M = 2100 MeV\/G 524 \nequatorial particles. The number of iterations used is the same for all simulations. 525 \nFigure 12(a) shows that there is an important difference between the results of the three 526 \nsimulations. When higher values are used for the radial diffusion coefficients, PSD 527 \nprofiles become much more flat, or completely flat for the case where DLL is increased by 528 \n 25\na factor of 6. Radial diffusion erases almost completely the effect of chorus wave 529 \ninteractions by diffusing particles away from the peak that tends to be created.  530 \nIn Figure 12(b), results from the dynamic simulations are plotted versus L* for 2100 531 \nMeV\/G equatorial electrons. The dynamic simulation performed here is the same 532 \ndynamic test-case simulation as the one presented in Section 4.2: starting from an initial 533 \nlow activity state (steady state for Kp = 1.3) we calculate the state of the electron 534 \nradiation belts after 1 day of high magnetic activity (1 day of Kp = 4). For the simulations 535 \npresented here, the common initial state used is a flat PSD distribution which corresponds 536 \nto the steady state calculated by using six times higher DLL values. 537 \nResults after one day of Kp = 4 (time T2) are presented for the three different DLL 538 \nvalues. The first thing that we notice is that even when an initial flat distribution is used, 539 \nirrespective of the size of DLL used, the effect of chorus waves is easily distinguishable: 540 \nelectrons are locally accelerated to MeV energies and a peak forms near L* = 5.  541 \nThe differences between the three curves at time T2 are at the location of the peak and 542 \nat the level of PSD. When higher DLL values are used, the peak is less pronounced, moves 543 \ninwards in L* and is characterized by lower PSD values. In these cases radial diffusion is 544 \nmore effective in diffusing particles away from the peak that chorus interactions tend to 545 \ncreate. In addition, strong outward radial diffusion is more effective at high L* values, 546 \nthus the peak of the electron distribution is now observed at lower L* shells.  547 \n 548 \n5.2. Initial state condition 549 \nWe compare the dynamics resulting after 1 day of Kp = 4 for two different initial state 550 \nconditions as shown in Figure 13. State 1 has a flat L*-profile and State 2 has a \u2018peaked\u2019 551 \n 26\nL*-profile with higher PSD values. From the comparison between dynamic state 1 (Dyn 552 \n1) and dynamic state 2 (Dyn 2) we conclude that phase space densities increase much 553 \nfaster in the case where the flat, lower initial state is used, reaching peak values similar to 554 \nthe ones for the case where the higher peaked initial state is used. The two initial states 555 \nare different by a factor of ~115 at the peak location (L* = 5.2), however the two dynamic 556 \nstates are different by only a factor of ~ 6.  557 \nThe reason for this difference is the fact that radial diffusion will initially be much 558 \nweaker in the simulation using State 1, since \u2202f\/\u2202L = 0 for all L* values greater than L* = 559 \n5. In this case, radial diffusion will become stronger only when a peak has started 560 \nforming due to chorus waves. However, in the simulation where State 2 is used, radial 561 \ndiffusion will be strong from the beginning since significant peak in the PSD L*-profile 562 \nexists initially. 563 \n 564 \n5.3. Boundary condition 565 \nThe outer boundary condition is an important parameter in the simulation. We chose to 566 \nuse a characteristic energy of 2 keV for the plasma sheet which is the average value 567 \nmeasured at geosynchronous orbit [Joseph Borovsky, private communication 2007]. 568 \nHowever, at geosynchronous altitude- near L* = 6.6- it is also measured that this 569 \ntemperature increases when magnetic activity increases, taking values of up to 5 keV 570 \n[Joseph Borovsky, private communication 2007].  571 \nIn this Section we investigate the sensitivity of the simulation results to the boundary 572 \ncondition. For this we consider two additional boundary conditions: one expressed by a 573 \nsimilar kappa distribution with characteristic energy of 5 keV (similar to the one used in 574 \n 27\nVarotsou et al., [2005]) and one obtained empirically from CRRES measurements (used 575 \nin radial diffusion studies [Shprits and Thorne, 2004; Shprits et al., 2005; Shprits et al., 576 \n2006b]). The latter is defined by an exponential fit of the average flux measured by 577 \nCRRES at L* = 7 and it is given by the expression  578 \n 579 \n( )141.0exp10*6.8222 3 EJ \u2212=                      (4) 580 \n 581 \nWhere J is the differential flux (in cm-2sr-1MeV-1s-1) and E is the kinetic energy of the 582 \nparticle (in MeV). Differential fluxes at L* = 7 are converted into PSD and then PSD 583 \nvalues are relaxed adiabatically to L* = 8 by assuming that the particle\u2019s magnetic 584 \nmoment is conserved. This assumption is based on the fact that only radial diffusion 585 \noccurs in the L* = 7-8 region in the Salammb\u00f4 code.    586 \n Both conditions are assumed to be constant with time like the one that was used in 587 \nsimulations presented before (kappa distribution with E0 = 2 keV). By keeping the 588 \nboundary condition constant we are able to clearly identify the effect of chorus waves on 589 \nthe electron dynamics. The effect of a time dependent boundary condition is currently 590 \nbeing studied and will be presented in a future paper (see Discussion section).   591 \nThe spectra of the three source conditions at the outer boundary are shown in Figure 14. 592 \nIf a higher characteristic energy kappa distribution is considered, PSD of higher energies 593 \nincreases and thus the \u2202f\/\u2202E values become smaller. As a result, we expect energy 594 \ndiffusion to be less important for this case. The second boundary condition from CRRES 595 \ndefines lower PSD values at low energies (E < 100 keV) and higher PSD values for E = 596 \n100 keV \u2013 1 MeV, compared to those defined by the kappa distribution with E0 = 2 keV. 597 \n 28\nWe must note here that we extrapolated the CRRES spectrum for E < 153 keV since the 598 \nMEA detector only measured fluxes for energies higher than 153 keV. This may not be 599 \nthe most realistic approach but provides us with another test case to study the effect of the 600 \nboundary condition on the MeV electron dynamics. To avoid any confusion we will call 601 \nthis condition the modified CRRES boundary condition. 602 \nWe have performed the same dynamic simulation as described in Section 4.2 for both 603 \nnew boundary conditions. Results are presented in Figures 15 (a), (b) and (c) for 2100 604 \nMeV\/G equatorial electrons for all three boundaries at times T1 and T2 of the dynamic 605 \ntest-case simulation. First thing we observe is that all boundary conditions produce a 606 \nlocal peak in the PSD L*-profile at time T2 at similar locations- near L* = 5. The most 607 \nimportant difference can be noted for the case when the modified CRRES condition is 608 \nused. For this case, the increase of PSD is less important than in the other two cases, even 609 \nthough a higher energy source is defined. This is due to the fact that the energy spectrum 610 \ndefined by this condition determines lower and flatter phase space densities at energies 611 \nlower than 100 keV. As a result, the source is smaller and the energy diffusion due to 612 \nchorus wave interactions weaker. 613 \nHowever, a higher energy spectrum at the source does not affect the amount of 614 \nenergization. Differences observed between Figure 15(a) and (b) at time T2 are due to the 615 \ndifference in the initial states at time T1 (see section 5.2).  616 \n 617 \n6. Discussion  618 \n The conclusions of our study are clearly shown and supported throughout this paper, 619 \nhowever, our simulations have important limitations. One of the first and most important 620 \n 29\nassumptions that we made was that chorus waves are confined near the equator. Adding 621 \nthe effect of chorus waves at higher latitudes will affect the acceleration rate of electrons 622 \nbut also their losses since losses are mostly determined by the value of D\u03b1\u03b1 near the edge 623 \nof the loss cone [Shprits et al., 2006a]. Various observations have shown that chorus 624 \nwaves are present at higher latitudes [Tsurutani and Smith, 1977; Meredith et al., 2003b]. 625 \nMeredith et al. [2003b] used CRRES data to show that dayside chorus waves are mostly 626 \nconfined to higher latitudes (\u03bb > 15 degrees) in contrast to night side chorus which are 627 \nmostly confined near the equator. When Li et al. [2007] introduced dayside high latitude 628 \nchorus (parallel propagating only), together with night side equatorial chorus, into their 629 \n2D simulations MeV losses at high latitudes became important,  however the net result 630 \nwas still electron acceleration. 631 \nAnother limitation of our simulation is imposed by the fact that energy and pitch angle 632 \ndiffusion coefficients due to chorus interactions are limited to a certain L* space. Recent 633 \nobservations have shown that chorus wave emissions can be detected at L* shells up to 634 \nL* = 10 [Santol\u03afk et al., 2005], however in our simulations they are confined at L* < 6.5. 635 \nThis prevents us from estimating the relative power of chorus interactions and radial 636 \ndiffusion outside L* = 6.2, which is the last grid point inside L* = 6.5 in Salammb\u00f4. 637 \nIn addition, diffusion coefficients due to chorus interactions are defined for three Kp 638 \ncategories: Kp < 2, 2 \u2264 Kp < 4 and Kp \u2265 4. The first two categories are small but the third 639 \none is very broad (from 4 to 9) and it is the one that interests us the most. This broad 640 \ncategorization is due to limited statistics for Kp \u2265 4. However, radial diffusion 641 \ncoefficients continuously increase with increasing geomagnetic activity. The Kp 642 \n 30\ncategorization for the chorus wave effect makes it hard to directly compare with the 643 \nradial diffusion effect, especially if we want to simulate higher than Kp = 4 storms.      644 \nThe precision of the Kp parameterization of wave intensity and fpe\/fce using the CRRES 645 \ndata can also be questioned. In the first half of the mission, when the satellite was on the 646 \ndayside (at dawn), activity was weak, however, on the second half of the mission, when 647 \nthe satellite was on the night side (at dusk), activity was high. For this second part, chorus 648 \nactivity for low Kp values may be overestimated. In addition, as it can be seen in Figure 1 649 \nof Meredith et al. [2003b], there exists an important data gap above L* = 5 near MLT = 650 \n10. 651 \nThese limitations are also pointed out by Maget et al. [2007] when they run the 652 \nSalammb\u00f4 3D code using data assimilation techniques and found that when they included 653 \nchorus wave interactions in the scheme, fluxes were overestimated in the region inside L 654 \n= 4 as compared to the CRRES data. 655 \nMore wave observations are needed for the better definition and understanding of the 656 \nregion where chorus waves are interacting with electrons, their relation to magnetic 657 \nactivity and their propagation characteristics. Many current observational studies focus 658 \non the determination of the source and spatial distribution of chorus emissions using data 659 \nfrom POLAR [Kristine Sigsbee, private communication 2007], CLUSTER and DOUBLE 660 \nSTAR [Santol\u03afk et al., 2004, 2005]. More data will be available in the future with the 661 \nupcoming Radiation Belt Storm Probes mission. 662 \nWe also think that the dependence of radial diffusion coefficients on energy and pitch 663 \nangle need to be further investigated. In the work presented here we chose to use the 664 \ndiffusion coefficients estimated by Brautigam and Albert [2000] since these are the 665 \n 31\nvalues generally used by the radiation belt community. These coefficients depend on L-666 \nshell and magnetic activity (Kp parameter). Varotsou et al. [2005] used radial diffusion 667 \ncoefficients based on calculations by Schulz [1991] that are energy, pitch angle and L 668 \ndependent. A magnetic activity dependence was added based on a calculation using data 669 \nfrom the CRRES satellite. Magnetic radial diffusion coefficients by Schulz [1991] 670 \nbecome ~ 7 times weaker at \u03b1eq = 20 degrees compared to their equatorial values. Thus, 671 \nresults presented in this paper are similar to the ones presented by Varotsou et al. [2005] 672 \nfor equatorial mirroring particles but different results are obtained for low \u03b1eq values (not 673 \nshown in Varotsou et al. [2005]). In the case where coefficients by Schulz [1991] are 674 \nused, we don\u2019t observe the decrease at \u03b1eq < 30 degrees, as seen in Figure 8, in Section 675 \n4.2.2. Recently, Perry et al. [2005] calculated radial diffusion coefficients by 676 \nincorporating spectral characteristics of Pc5 waves into 3D simulations using the guiding 677 \ncenter approximation. They found that when a data-based, frequency and L-dependent 678 \nmodel is used for the wave power, an important decrease in radial diffusion coefficients 679 \noccurs as the mirror latitude increases from 0 degrees (equator) to 20 degrees. 680 \nFinally, we must note the absence of the cross diffusion coefficient D\u03b1E in equation (2). 681 \nThe effect of this coefficient on the final result is still a subject of discussion. The high 682 \nvalues of the coefficient as calculated by the PADIE code [Glauert and Horne, 2005]- 683 \nsometimes even higher than the energy diffusion coefficient- suggest that its effect will 684 \nbe important. A recent study by Albert and Young [2005] showed that when the cross 685 \nterm is introduced in the diffusion equation results are qualitatively similar, but for small 686 \n\u03b1eq energy diffusion is overestimated if the cross diffusion is neglected. The cross 687 \ndiffusion term is not included in any current 3D radiation belt code. 688 \n 32\nOur current priority is to validate the new code by simulating a real storm. A more 689 \nrealistic study of the radiation belt dynamics during geomagnetic storm conditions, where 690 \nthe Kp and boundary variation are taken from real data, is currently being performed and 691 \nwill be presented in a future paper.  692 \nAnother important development of our code is the introduction of higher latitude day 693 \nside chorus. As discussed above, these waves are expected to introduce MeV electron 694 \nlosses into the loss cone. 695 \nIn addition, other wave types are currently being studied for introduction in the 696 \nSalammb\u00f4 code. Recent studies have shown that enhanced EMIC waves in plasmaspheric 697 \nplumes formed during the storm\u2019s main phase (e.g., Erlandson and Ukhorskiy, 2001) can 698 \ncause strong MeV electron losses from pitch angle diffusion in the loss cone (Thorne and 699 \nKennel, 1971; Albert, 2003; Summers and Thorne, 2003). Plasmaspheric hiss is currently 700 \nincluded in the code but it is independent of geomagnetic activity. Our current goal is to 701 \nintroduce activity dependent hiss, since studies have shown that hiss is enhanced during 702 \nactive conditions [Meredith et al., 2004].  703 \nFinally, we want to underline the importance of comparing results obtained from 704 \ndifferent codes. We hope that in the future we will be able to work with other teams in 705 \ncomparing simulation results. However this has to be done with much caution since the 706 \nassumptions considered in each model are different.   707 \n 708 \n7. Conclusions  709 \nWe have run steady state and dynamic test-case simulations to study the effect of 710 \nelectron-chorus resonant interactions on the radiation belt electron dynamics. We used 711 \n 33\nthe Salammb\u00f4 3D physical model which includes radial diffusion and particle-wave 712 \ninteractions inside and outside of the plasmasphere. Simulations were performed where 713 \nboth electron-chorus interactions and radial diffusion were included in the code but we 714 \nalso run simulations with only one of the two processes included. In that way we were 715 \nable to identify the role of each of these two key physical processes on the radiation belt 716 \ndynamics. The main results of our study are the following: 717 \n1. The introduction of chorus interactions in the Salammb\u00f4 code leads to the local 718 \nacceleration of electrons to MeV energies. 719 \n2. Acceleration during dynamic test-case simulations of moderate activity conditions 720 \n(Kp = 4) is stronger at L* ~5 and for equatorial pitch angles near 90 degrees. 721 \n3. The net effect of a geomagnetic storm- the peak value and location- is defined by 722 \nthe relative power between chorus interactions and radial diffusion. 723 \n4. Simulation results are not sensitive to the high energy distribution of the source, 724 \nhowever they are sensitive to the low energy distribution (E < 100 keV).   725 \nOur results support the following scenario: during active geomagnetic periods low 726 \nenergy electrons are transported inwards from an outer source location by enhanced 727 \nconvection and radial diffusion, a fraction of them are energized locally to MeV energies 728 \nby chorus interactions. At the same time radial diffusion acts diffusing particles inwards 729 \nand outwards from the peak that tends to form in the PSD distribution. 730 \n 34\nReferences 731 \nAbel, B. and R. M.
