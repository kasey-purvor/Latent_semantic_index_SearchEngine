This article is about\nwhat is demanded of systemic psychotherapists embarking on family\nwork where a child has been diagnosed with depression. It speaks to\nthe emotions we experienced both during and after family sessions\nand what sense we have made of these in order to work effectively. A\nsystematic approach to clinical discussion among clinicians proved to\nbe the key to theory building and the interventions described. This\npaper demonstrates what happens when clinicians talk and think\ntogether about what they do. Its conclusions about working with\nchildhood depression have emerged from reflecting on the emotive\nexperience of the therapist during the therapeutic encounter.

Instead we take this\nopportunity to open up a dialogue with our professional colleagues\nabout clinical practice in a relatively unexplored area for the systemic\nfield.\nBackground to our involvement with childhood depression\nOur participation in the BIOMED outcome study based in three\nEuropean cities forms the basis of our involvement in working with\nfamilies where a child has been identified as depressed. This study\nfollowed a comparative design comparing family treatment with child\npsychotherapy and parallel parent work with children who meet the\ndiagnostic criteria for clinical depression. The design of the study\nrequired the creation of two treatment teams \u2013 one treating whole\nfamilies, the other meeting individual children with separate work\nwith parents \u2013 in each participating city. The London family therapy\nteam, of which we were part, consisted of four therapists working in\npairs, co-working together in the room or via a one-way screen. The\nclinical work of the team was supervised at monthly review meetings\nwhere video tape was shown and clinical discussion took place and, on\noccasion, by live supervision behind the one-way screen. Between us\nour team met with twelve families who were seen for a maximum of\nfourteen sessions at regular intervals. Some of the working practices,\nsuch as the fourteen-session requirement and joint work, were set out\nby the protocols of the research project. However, the frequency of\nmeetings, the development and detailed direction that the work took\nand the development of interventions grew out of our thinking\ntogether both as colleagues and as part of the wider supervision team.\nThe preoccupations of the wider research project were, in truth,\nfascinating but remote. Our concerns overlapped in respect to\nidentifying evidence of the effectiveness of our work. However, while\nour research colleagues struggled with questionnaire completion and\ndata gathering, we wrestled with the task of seeing families and\ncreating a context for change within a time limit. As such we became\npreoccupied with a number of practice issues including how we, as\ntherapists, work systemically when the problem has already been\nnamed as depression and devising the most effective way to intervene\nsystemically. We also wondered what the effect of such work would be\non us as therapists and how our own \u2018depression stories\u2019 may play\ntheir part in the therapeutic process.\n404 David Pentecost and Sue McNab\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nSome thoughts about depictions of childhood depression\nBefore presenting our experience in detail we want to share our\nresponses as systemic practitioners to working within the \u2018childhood\ndepression\u2019 frame.\nThe term \u2018Depression\u2019, it seems to us, carries the potential of\nbringing idiomatic experiences of sadness, malaise and melancholia\ninto a medicalized domain. Angold (1993) and Carroll (1984) have\nhighlighted the ill-defined nature and classification of the disorder\nwithin existing medical discourses. From the first we felt uneasy\nconceptualizing and hypothesizing around a label that seemed des-\ntined to conflict with other ideas we hold. Ideas like the \u2018taken for\ngrantedness\u2019 of labels and the ability of medical discourses to margin-\nalize the \u2018local\u2019 knowledge of patients and to medicalize people\u2019s\nexperiences. Seifer et al. (1989) and Nurcombe et al. (1998) have\nhighlighted the questionable epistemology surrounding the aetiology\nand DSM IV classifications of depression. In line with their concerns\nwe were dubious about the usefulness of \u2018illness\u2019 constructions,\nparticularly in psychologically oriented treatment domains. Illness\nconstructions often depersonalize and categorize people\u2019s experience\n\u2013 i.e. into moderate, mild, chronic depression, anadonia and so on \u2013 in\nways that we do not find clinically fruitful.\nNotwithstanding the reservations detailed above, we assume a\nmulti-systems perspective in our work which tries to take account of\nthe biological, medical and psychosocial components of depression.\nFrom biology we pay attention to the influence of a child\u2018s tempera-\nment, their genetic disposition and potential for resilience or vulner-\nability. On the medical front we try to temper our concerns over the\nethics and safety of pharmacological interventions with the knowledge\nthat for many adults, at least, medication has often proved to be a\nlifeline in managing their difficulties. When it comes to depression in\nchildren, we note the relative powerlessness of children to have their\nvoices heard. Within their family context, children often wield little\npower in relation to marital violence, family separations and continu-\ning contact with an out-of-house parent. They have little say about\ndecisions around immigration and perhaps are uncertain how to\nmanage depression or other mental or physical health problems\nin other family members. Powerlessness and hopelessness are\nconnected.\nFinally we are committed to a relational approach to understanding\nchildhood sadness. Depression gains a foothold in families over time\nKeeping company with hope and despair 405\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nthrough external events such as loss, bereavement, trauma, abuse,\nwar and conflict, and family separation. As a result, despair, hope-\nlessness and a dread of the future can get into the grain of family life \u2013\nthe monotony of greyness. We are convinced that the families we see\ncarry stories generated over time and generations which can lead to\ntwo, three or more members of the family becoming preoccupied by\nloss and hopelessness. We think depression is both \u2018individual\u2019 and\n\u2018interactional\u2019. It is influenced by and in turn influences the complex\nnetwork of interactions that make up family life. The child may be one\nof a number of family members who are in the grip of \u2018depression\u2019.\nWe often wonder if children present themselves or their families for\nhelp when the children feel the odds against change are stacked too\nhigh.\nExploring the therapeutic experience of working with childhood\ndepression\nWe have conceptualized three major and interweaving themes that\npresented themselves time after time in our therapeutic work:\n\u0001 Striking the balance between action and reflection;\n\u0001 Bearing witness to emotional pain;\n\u0001 Keeping hope alive.\nIn the sections that follow we will explore each of these themes in\ndetail. We want to show how the links between the presenting\ndifficulties, the experience of the therapeutic relationship and the\nprocess of reflection as a team led us towards these themes. Case\nmaterial will be used as illustrations.\nStriking the balance between action and reflection\nIn our experience depression in children manifests itself in diverse\nand often surprising ways. We did not always encounter the sad face of\ndepression among the young people whom we met. Many of the\nchildren we saw were angry, aggressive, defiant and impulsive and\nparents often cited conduct problems as the major factor in their\nseeking help.\nWorking with distressed and troubled children bears a close\nsimilarity to working with other life-and-death issues, such as anorexia\nnervosa, where the symptom itself cries out for attention and respect.\nIn some families children had actively self-harmed by overdose or\n406 David Pentecost and Sue McNab\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nwere risking their safety through not eating or dangerous antisocial\nbehaviours. We suspected these were driven by emotional pain but we\nnoticed that parents often presented these worries as \u2018complaints\u2019\nabout their child\u2019s behaviour expressed in a particularly static,\nmonotonous and repetitive way. Parents either felt powerless to\nhelp lift their children out of the mire, or seemed caught in cycles\nof blame and criticism. We found a preoccupation with personal loss\nand a quality of negativism in parental communication. These factors,\ntogether with a general unwillingness to take \u2018action\u2019 around safety\nissues, frequently made a subtle contribution to the escalation of risk.\nReena is a 14- year-old Asian girl who had spent the past few months in her\ndarkened room refusing to go to school due to the spots on her face. She had\ntaken a number of serious paracetamol overdoses prior to our work starting.\nThe drama of the family\u2019s life over the past few years was spread before the\ntherapists in the first meeting. Reena\u2019s older brother had died of a brain tumour\nsix years previously \u2013 a death his father felt responsible for as he had dealt his\nson blows to the head when he failed in his academic work. Reena\u2019s parents,\nSujit and Ravinda, had entered into an arranged marriage and felt locked in a\nrelationship dominated by conflict from which they could see no escape. They\nboth talked of being depressed and Sujit had just completed treatment for\nleukaemia. Furthermore one of their nephews, aged 19, had tragically hanged\nhimself a year earlier. In our initial sessions we wanted to communicate a strong\nmessage that therapy was a place where these emotional issues could be explored\nand given voice. However, each new session with the family seemed to be an\noccasion for further revelation of family tragedy that grabbed our attention.\nBetween us we began to recognize a tension in what we were each holding on to:\nthe interviewing therapist was creating opportunities to open up exploration\nabout the family\u2019s trauma while the observing therapist was very concerned\nabout the ongoing risk of self-harm to Reena. This difference in focus between\nthe therapists revealed that as a therapeutic system there was a need to find the\nbalance between the wish to explore meaning and the need to move to action.\nWe met with Sujit and Ravinda to address how they (not us) could keep the\nrisk to Reena in mind. They took time in the session to speak about the pattern of\nviolence from husband to wife. Deep emotions such as pain, shame, grief,\ndisappointment and fear were alive in the room. Our challenge again was\nholding open a space to address the conflicts in the marriage while keeping a\nwatchful eye on risk factors for Reena. Our growing hypothesis centred on\nseeing the function of Reena\u2019s depression as bringing an end to the violence in\nthe marriage. In therapy we sought on the one hand to cling to the emotional\nintensity of this new information but at the same time to maintain a focus on\nKeeping company with hope and despair 407\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nthemes of \u2018danger\u2019 and \u2018responsibility\u2019. When the point came to confront the\ncouple about their need to find their own structured steps to safeguard the safety\nof their daughter \u2013 through actively monitoring Reena\u2019s risky behaviour,\nincreasing their vigilance and stopping the couple violence \u2013 we were struck\nby their apparent readiness to take on board what they needed to do. On\nreflection we believe that the parents\u2019 growing realization that therapy is an\naccepting emotional space for both them as well as their child made them more\nable to listen to our more strident message about the need to act. Of course\nbreaking off from the emotionally charged couple material to confront risk\nposed numerous dilemmas for the therapists. Were we sufficiently in tune with\nthe cross-cultural nature of this work? Was the interventive style of our\nquestioning sensitive enough to the highly emotional state of these family\nmembers? Was the balance between reflection and action good enough? There\nwere moments when as therapists we feared that becoming directive ran the risk\nof losing the family \u2013 by this point we were pushing the parents to actively\nconsider the possibility of an inpatient admission for Reena. However, we\nfound that raising the stakes in this way actually allowed the parents the chance\nto find their own solution. Far from ending therapy the couple returned to the\nnext session explaining that they had now invited a counsellor from their own\nculture to help them with their relationship, explaining to us that while they\ncould allow us to work with their daughter, discussing their own marital\ndifficulties with people from another culture had been too shameful. Shame was\na very potent emotion for the whole family. Reena, who had refused to speak\nand had kept her hands over her face throughout so many sessions, later\nrevealed that it had been shame of the violence in her family as much as \u2018spots\u2019\nthat meant she had literally not been able to show her face in public.\nSo what do experiences like this tell us about the effect of depression\non family and therapist functioning? We think \u2018depressed\u2019 children\nmay protect the emotional needs of a vulnerable and depressed\nparent by abandoning attempts to get connected to them (the parents)\nand instead recruit into the parenting relationship a wider profes-\nsional system, whose job it becomes \u2013 through fear for the child\u2019s\nsafety \u2013 to strike a balance between the quest for meaning and the\nneed for action.\nByng-Hall (1999) talks of the need to provide a secure therapeutic\nbase by being willing and able to address the most worrying concerns\neither of the family, or of the therapeutic system early on in the work.\nThis may mean suspending exploration of meanings initially in\nsessions in favour of a more structured approach to minimize risk.\nIt may also mean having to hold back on our own urge to \u2018explore\u2019\n408 David Pentecost and Sue McNab\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nchange \u2013 as in Reena\u2019s case \u2013 so that time is given to forming this\n\u2018secure base\u2019 from which therapists can impel the parents\u2019 attention to\nhigh levels of risk and boost the executive functioning of the parents\nso that they act on plans for safety strategies. Of course the desire to\n\u2018take charge\u2019 of risk also deserves to be unpacked. As a therapy team\nwe always became more curious about those times, when we became\nincreasingly wedded to a predominantly \u2018risk management\u2019 stance in\nthe work. One hypothesis we shared was that risky situations and the\ncontagious power of depression can invite us to be more \u2018directive\u2019 in\nour approach.\nThe timing of our move from reflection\/exploration to action may\nalso be an attempt to counteract our and the family\u2019s despair, so that\nwe are being propelled into becoming more directive and author-\nitative, as if we (not the parents, grandparents) are the ones able to\nthrow out a lifeline that will pull the families and ourselves out of the\ndepths.\nA second example illustrates the tensions of sitting with despair\nrather than running towards action.\nFourteen-year-old Omar, a boy of dual parentage, was referred to the project by\nhis GP. Omar was unhappy at school, he was bright but struggling academi-\ncally, he complained of constant tiredness but could not sleep at night. He felt\nhe had few friends and saw himself as a victim of teacher and pupil bullying.\nThe main concern of Omar\u2019s mother, Anita B., was her son\u2019s verbal aggression,\nviolent mood swings, and constant protest that \u2018everyone is against me\u2019. Omar\nlived with Anita and her boyfriend Delroy and had only sporadic contact with\nhis Somali father and his father\u2019s girlfriend, despite the fact that they lived in\nan upmarket apartment only minutes away from the tough housing estate where\nOmar and and his mother lived.\nOmar\u2019s pattern of non-compliance and disruptive behaviour at home and\nschool was a source of bitter complaint and recrimination between mother and\nson, but we also heard of a three-generational familial history of loss, abuse and\nabandonment, Ms B specifically, describing an unhappy childhood character-\nized by physical and emotional abuse, multiple separations and disruptions\nthrough illness. Exploring the connections that could be made about the place\n\u2018depression\u2019 occupies in the life and history of their relationships seemed crucial.\nBut Anita\u2019s insistence that sessions focus on Omar\u2019s problem behaviour meant\nthat family meetings became a place where blame was apportioned and then\nvigorously defended. The pull to enter these battles as a referee was strong; the\nproblem-saturated descriptions made us worry that our attempts to reflect on\nwhat the sadness in the family might tell us were going to lose the family from\nKeeping company with hope and despair 409\nr 2007 The Authors.

However, withstanding the urge to be propelled into action around\nbehaviour management allowed Anita\u2019s distress to emerge in sessions. As Anita\ncries during one of the sessions the conversation moves to exploration with\nOmar of his understanding of his mother\u2019s despair.\nTherapist: Omar was saying that he has been aware that there are times when\nyou are tearful. . ..much more than in the past?\nAnita: Yeah seems to . . . as I get older . . . yeah . . .

Don\u2019t you agree?\nOmar: No!\nA: No?. . . . Oh OK. . . . [sounding hurt and irritated, which in the past\nhas been a trigger for more argument]\nT: Do you ask Mum about those feelings?

The disconnection between\nmother and son over the meaning of Anita\u2019s despair has been replaced in their\nrelationship by anger and frustration. A familiar cycle of argument and\ncriticism has become a safer way for mother and son to relate and avoids the\nexploration of the place that \u2018depression\u2019 occupies in their life together.\nTherapeutically it seemed crucial to sit with the despair and hopelessness,\nattempting to understand how the family\u2019s life \u2018with depression\u2019 is constructed.\nIn this case the \u2018pull\u2019 was to locate the problems in Omar\u2019s defiance\nand aggression. We suspect that one function that the focus upon\ndisruption serves for the family is in dragging everyone out and away\nfrom the deep well of despair that depression can open up in the\nroom. This idea has close links with our next theme.\nBearing witness to emotional pain\nFor experienced therapists like ourselves, who have grown up with\ntraditions in systemic practice that call for active and at times directive\nparticipation and conducting of sessions, forging emotional connec-\ntions with families in the grip of depression is a complex task. As\ntherapists, one of the primary tools of our trade is the use of\nlanguage and the construction of meanings and stories through\nconversations. Depression has the tendency to silence people,\ndenying them full access to the spoken word and hence to their\nstories. This can be exacerbated during adolescence when at the best\nof times self-expression \u2013 particularly with adults \u2013 is a difficult\nprocess. Building connections through language can therefore be\npainfully hard. Working with Reena meant trying to interpret her\nshrugs, nods and shakes of the head throughout the fourteen sessions\nof our work together. We had to be more creative in our work \u2013 using\ndifferent ways of communicating through writing, using the one-way\nscreen in collaborative ways and not depending solely on the spoken\nword.\nSimilarly, therapists rely on joining skills to engage emotionally\nwith clients through the subtle nuances of body language, facial\nKeeping company with hope and despair 411\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nexpressions and tone of voice. Minuchin and Fishman (1981) speak of\nthis as mimesis \u2013 the mirroring by the therapist of the client\u2019s\ninteractions and actions. However, once again, depression can render\na sufferer\u2019s affect flat, \u2018un\u2019interactional and disconnected. Hopeless-\nness and despair can feel like an impenetrable wall encircling the\nfamily which the therapist throws herself against time and time again\nin an attempt to find a foothold. Co-therapists often observed the\ntherapy as moving very slowly and at times feeling distracted or\ndisengaged. In contrast the interviewing therapist feels the therapeu-\ntic process as very active and demanding despite the long silences and\nthe client\u2019s commitment to the idea that nothing can change. There is\na wariness, a prickliness to the engagement process that makes even\nthe most experienced therapist feel de-skilled, useless and even\nfoolish. At times like these the temptation to give up and withdraw\nis strong especially when this rejection evokes a sense of failure in our\nability to connect.\nSo what has helped keep the therapists potent and connected in\nthese situations? \u2018The self \u2019 of the therapist emerged as a crucial\ncomponent influencing the ability of the therapeutic team to work\nthrough these impasses in treatment. In our conversations we re-\nturned again and again to the idea of self-reflexivity as a tool in our\njoint thinking. This relies on the opportunity to reflect on our own\nstories of loss and despair, of optimism and negativity, and the ability\nto link these crucial dynamics to our work with families. This is not\neasy to do \u2013 we too feel the stigma that is attached to these \u2018mental\nhealth\u2019 issues.\nWe found that all of us had been touched by the experience of\ndepression either ourselves or through someone close to us. A \u2018safe\u2019\ntherapeutic team allows consideration of how our own personal\nstories feed into the dilemmas described by our clients. It is a place\nwhere one can disentangle personal and professional issues. For\nexample, a sense of failure about having not been watchful enough\nin a personal context may encourage therapists to reflect on their\ntendency to privilege the importance of risk management and\ninterventive practice. Failure to keep the hope alive in a personal\nstory may encourage perseverance and stick-ability in a clinical\ncontext where the feeling is that giving up is not an option. This\nmay result in overworking, doubling one\u2019s efforts and perhaps taking\ntoo much responsibility for change. Conversely, it may promote a high\nsense of despondency and despair and freeze a therapist\u2019s creative\npossibilities.\n412 David Pentecost and Sue McNab\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nWe also recognize the importance of questioning how our own\npersonal stories might lead us into drawing back from staying with\nthe stress or the monotony of greyness, as some of our clients\nperceive their lives. We have come to see the perturbation that\nthis sets up in the therapist as an expected part of the work. There\nare a number of emotions that we have come to anticipate and\nfind useful in thinking about what is happening in the therapeutic\nprocess. These include humour, mania and depression. We see\nthese emotions as companions to the work we are doing and as\nresources in reflecting and hypothesizing about what we need to do\nnext.\nThe Talbot family had attended six out of the possible fourteen sessions that had\nbeen planned. Our colleagues who had been working with the family presented\na video extract for discussion in supervision. The clip chosen presents a\nconversation between the therapist and Mrs Talbot who is describing a\ncompulsion she has developed to steal from shops. The client reveals how the\npattern began with small items of cosmetics and has grown into more audacious\nthefts of expensive clothes, which incur greater and greater risks. The therapist\nexplores the underlying feelings which are linked to the client\u2019s unhappiness\nand despair. The shame of discovery and prosecution would be an outward\nmanifestation of her inner turmoil and stark choices she gives herself between\nincarceration or suicide. As the account of internal torment unfolds, certain\nmembers of the observing\/supervising team appear to be fascinated by details of\nwhat the client has stolen. Soon this is superseded by humorous speculations\nabout how \u2018Mrs T\u2019 gets \u2018away with it. . . . what is her technique\u2019? The\naccompanying laughter that gets hold of the group for a few moments seems\nat odds with the seriousness of the narrative the team is witness to. Fortunately\nat one point a member of the team was able to disconnect from the interaction\nand comment on the process. Subsequent reflections enabled the team to identify\nhow being witness to the client\u2019s confusion and distress was hard to bear and the\nhumour therefore provided a buffer and defence against the complex feelings\nevoked in us as observers.\nThis issue of \u2018mania\u2019 cannot be overestimated. We have come to know\nwhen we are working on the \u2018edge of life\u2019, i.e. with depression or\nanorexia, by the level of high-energy laughter that is around us. The\nuncontrollable and overexcitable nature of our responses to the work\nat times shocked us, but in conversation with colleagues working on\nthis project in other European centres, we found that this was not an\nuncommon experience.\nKeeping company with hope and despair 413\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nOne way we have spoken of using these emotional experiences\nas resources is by referring among ourselves to the idea of a\n\u2018third eye\u2019. By this we mean a process whereby in our work we\nmonitor simultaneously what is going on in the family, what is\ngoing on in the person of the therapist, but what is also going on\nwithin the therapeutic team. The third eye watches over the whole\nprocess, providing moments when different members of the team\nspeculate about where \u2018despair\u2019 is located, where hopelessness\nhas found a home. This metaphor enables us to reflect as a team\nabout the timing of our mania or our humour so that we can think\nagain about what function these emotions might have in the\ntherapeutic process.\nKeeping hope alive\nWe agree with Flaskas (2007) when she says that it is the job of\ntherapists to hold on to hope for their clients in seemingly hopeless\nsituations. Keeping hope alive is a crucial part of the work we do with\n\u2018depressed systems\u2019. But is it in any way different to the hope we try to\ninstil in other areas of our therapeutic practice? We do think that work\nwith childhood depression does present a different emotional quality\nin this regard.\nWe have had to continually monitor the extent to which we felt\ndrowned in depression ourselves, mentally overwhelmed and useless.\nAs already highlighted, we frequently found ourselves working on the\nedge between hope and desolation, at times witness to the stultifying\neffects of depression on people\u2019s lives and at other times amazed by\nfamilies\u2019 ability to take the modest flicker of optimism from a\ntherapeutic session and return next time reporting new changes\nthey have made.\nHowever, we have to be careful about resolving these polarizations\nin us by simply \u2018talking up the positives\u2019. In our experience families\ncan quickly see through these contributions if they are not grounded\nin an authentic in-session experience of hope or change. Most clients\nhave ridden the merry-go-round of false hope and are therefore\nsuspicious of those moments when we clinicians cling on to some\nenthusiasm or jollity in the session as confirmation that things are on\nthe \u2018up\u2019.\nMore often though it was the need to increase our sense of hope-\nfulness that we needed to address. Our preferred approach for this is\nbuilt around the idea that we can only be effective in therapy as long as\n414 David Pentecost and Sue McNab\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\ntwo therapists are working closely together. Co-work provides the\nopportunity for one member of the therapeutic team to become, as\nwe call it, \u2018inducted into the depressive position\u2019. Minuchin and\nFishman (1981) describe a process whereby the therapist gets\npulled into the interactional pattern of the family and thereby gains a\nunique perspective on the dynamics operating therein. We have\nfound it helpful to recognize that one member of the team may\nbecome inducted into the despair, which may show itself as frustration,\nlack of curiosity, a feeling that minimal or no change is happening.\nAs challenging fixed narratives about the futility of change is such\na crucial aspect of this work, the second member of the pair is\nneeded to occupy a role in cheering on the smallest change, positively\nconnoting family stories of entrenched behaviour and immutable\npersonalities.\nThis \u2018binocular\u2019 approach allowed us to notice and expand the\n\u2018sparkling moments\u2019 (White and Epston, 1990) during our conversa-\ntions with families. In many cases, working towards \u2018preferred\nfutures\u2019 rather than dwelling in hopeless pasts became our preferred\npath and instilled hope into the system. Setting small goals for young\npeople, who had not been in school for long periods and seeing these\nsuccessfully achieved spurred us all on. We often became \u2018cheerlea-\nders for change\u2019!\nA further aspect to keeping hope alive links to the necessity to build\ndependable and encouraging networks around the children \u2013 parti-\ncularly for those young people who were out of the formal education\nprocess. It felt essential to include the school system directly in our\nwork with families and we were fortunate enough to find very willing\nand able colleagues in teachers and support workers. Depression can\nshrink and lose some of its grip in the face of a steadfast team tackling\nthe problem.\nJohn is the middle son of divorced parents and had experienced extreme\nbullying at school for a number of years. When his father left the family, John\u2019s\nschool attendance declined dramatically and by the time he joined the project he\nhad been out of school for over a year. John is a very bright boy with many\nacademic aspirations and his lack of formal education exacerbated his\ndepression. The relationship between family and school was understandably\ndifficult and bringing these two systems closer together was part of our systemic\nwork. It did also involve the therapist visiting the school and spending some\ntime in the sixth-form common-room, from which experience she could fully\nunderstand John\u2019s reluctance in returning!\nKeeping company with hope and despair 415\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nIn considering what keeps hope alive for families and for therapists\nand how these threads interweave we began to appreciate that in\norder to provide a safe and hopeful environment for families, we had\nto pay attention to making ourselves as safe as possible in our\nsurroundings. Jones and Asen (2000) talk of the importance of having\nsome control over the work environment in a research project and for\nus this was not without its complications. We often worked late into the\nevening, in an institution that was not our primary workplace and\nwhere rooms had to be negotiated, files found and new equipment\nstruggled with. We would therefore recommend that more than \u2018good\nenough\u2019 opportunities for supervision and support be available for\nco-workers embarking on this work.\nFinding an irreverent position within the research process\nIn preparing this paper we wondered if readers would be interested\nin hearing about how the context of the Biomed study may have\ninfluenced our systemic epistemology. Cecchin\u2019s (1992) description of\nirreverence proved to be one of the mainstays of our survival kit as\ntherapists in relation to the wider study. Initially we found it hard to\npromote our own irreverence to the discourses underpinning the\nresearch method and design. This was largely because we were invited\nto join the project by a team of experienced and respected colleagues\nwho in the distant past had been our tutors. Feeling flattered, excited\nto be \u2018part of something\u2019 led to a momentary lapse in our ability to be\nirreverent or at least to give voice to it.\nEarly on we noted the process through which the systems group on\nthe project began to construct language that made us susceptible to\nthe know-ability of this \u2018out-there\u2019 entity called depression. In retro-\nspect we realize that the imperatives of the research \u2013 testing\nhypotheses, gathering a sample, thresholds and cut-offs developed\nthrough psychiatric assessment \u2013 placed a burden on our systemic\nthinking. The highest context marker for the families for the idea of\ndepression in their child was that medical colleagues had said it was so.\nThe effect of this dominant discourse on local practices was that the\nsystems group became comfortable for a while \u2013 until we drew\nattention to it \u2013 with the use of such phrases as \u2018these depressed\nfamilies\u2019, \u2018these depressed mothers\u2019 and \u2018these types of children\u2019.\nAdopting an irreverent position towards medicalization enabled us to\nhold on to more hopeful discourses about the clients\u2019 own capacity to\nget themselves better.\n416 David Pentecost and Sue McNab\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\nJones and Asen (2000) talk of an approach towards clinical work\nthat \u2018prides itself on being \u2018\u2018context-minded\u2019\u2019, which cannot continue\nto ignore the contexts of gender, poverty, inequity and power in the\nattempt to finds ways of dealing with depression\u2019. Putting depression\ninto a wider societal context can dilute a \u2018personal deficit\u2019 frame and\ninspires more hope for the possibility of change \u2013 both in clients and\nin us. We think \u2018depression\u2019 lends itself well to being externalized.\nThus we get client families to unite around a battle with the condition\nrather than with one another. We have also spoken to families about\nhow depression has become a family member \u2013 sometimes through\nthe generations \u2013 and built on family resources for giving it a more\n\u2018junior\u2019 position in the system.\nA position of \u2018authoritative doubt\u2019 (Mason, 1993) towards the\nmeaning and relevance of the concept of depression does not in our\ncase represent a lack of respect for the other epistemologies. Instead it\nfreed us up to get on and do the work we felt was important, enabling\nus to experiment, follow hunches and improvise. We see families for\nwhom stories of loss, things never being good enough, life being\nunfair, have taken a too powerful hold. If this is what depression\nis up to, so be it. But a side-effect of becoming too reverent about\nlabels like depression is conceptual inertia. Arguably, systemic\npractitioners need to use the skills they know best \u2013 questioning,\ncuriosity and serious play \u2013 to challenge depression ideas and stories\nthat remain fixed in the present. Thus we invite our families to be\nactively \u2018anti-depressant\u2019 in recognition of how this \u2018condition\u2019 is\nwrecking their lives.\nFinally, a comment about how working with childhood depression\nhas influenced our work in other clinical settings. These days we are\nmore irreverent to our own \u2018taken-for-granted\u2019 ideas about the\nmanifestation of depression. We now pay more attention to the range\nof behaviours that might signify depression. Hyperactivity, school\nrefusal, disruptive behaviour and drug and alcohol misuse are all\nareas where we may now explore the role of sadness, despair and\nhopelessness in the individual, or in the system. We have constructed\na number of questions we would ask in relation to the presenting\nproblems that can introduce an alternative perspective on sadness or\ndepression. For example:\n\u0001 \u2018If sadness had a voice in your family, what would it be saying?\u2019\n\u0001 \u2018If feeling low is also part of what you have been experiencing,\nwhat thoughts do you have about the part it may play?\u2019\nKeeping company with hope and despair 417\nr 2007 The Authors. Journal compilationr 2007 The Association for Family Therapy and Systemic Practice\n\u0001 \u2018When we meet a family where one person is as angry as this (or\nas hyper), we sometimes wonder what place unhappiness had\nwithin your family.\u2019\nConclusion\nIn this article we have presented a detailed description of our own\nexperience as therapists of working within an under-researched area\nfor systemic practice. We have tried to give an account of the key\naspects of the therapists\u2019 experience in working intensively with\nfamilies where depression has been identified as a factor. We have\ntried to show that keeping company with despair, as we have come to\nthink of this work, can have a profound influence on one\u2019s usual\npractice, thinking processes and application of systemic theory. We\nhave come to appreciate the importance of therapists\u2019 ability to hold\non to hope when all seems hopeless \u2013 for the family and for\nthemselves. We began by saying that this article was an attempt to\npromote a dialogue. We would hope that to be the case within the\nsystemic community but a broader hope would be to think about our\nideas together with our colleagues in related disciplines, for whom the\narea of childhood depression may prove a magnet for interest,\nresearch and intervention.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank our many colleagues on the Biomed Project\nboth in London, Athens and Helsinki.
