Re-\nsearch by reproductive ecologists has established that levels of\novarian function, measured as average profiles of salivary\nprogesterone and oestradiol, differ considerably within and\nbetween individuals and populations [1,2]. Detailed studies\nhave demonstrated that age [3] and acute energetic factors\nsuch as immune challenges [4], nutrition and\/or energy\nexpenditure, whether voluntarily imposed [5,6] or ecologi-\ncally determined [7\u20139], are responsible for some of this\nvariance. However, even after acute factors are accounted for,\nsignificant interpopulation differences in baseline levels of\novarian function remain evident. Energetically, nutritionally,\nor immunologically challenged populations exhibit chroni-\ncally lower profiles of reproductive steroids than their\naffluent counterparts. The question of how this variation\narises and what its functional significance may be is still\npoorly understood.\nBased on indirect evidence for an association between\nchronic energy availability and age at menarche (proxy for\nmaturation tempo) [10\u201312], and empirical data on the inverse\nrelationship between menarcheal age and levels of ovarian\nfunction [13\u201316], researchers have postulated that baseline\nvariation in ovarian function may have a developmental\norigin [17,18]. It has been proposed that variation in adult\nlevels of reproductive hormones occurs as a consequence of\ndifferences in chronic energy availability during growth and\ndevelopment which, in turn, result in diverse maturation\ntempos and the establishment of different adult physiological\nset points for regulation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013\novarian and related metabolic axes [18,19]. This hypothesis\nsits within the framework of life history theory, which posits\nthat energy, as a limited resource, needs to be allocated\nbetween maintenance, growth, and reproductive functions,\nthus generating trade-offs. The way in which such trade-offs\nare resolved is driven by natural selection to yield optimal\nallocation patterns within specific relevant constraints [20].\nIn this context, the rates of childhood growth and adolescent\nmaturation provide a bioassay of environmental quality,\nparticularly the overall level of energy above maintenance\ncosts that is likely to be available for reproduction in later life\n[18].\nThe developmental hypothesis therefore predicts that\nadverse energetic conditions during development that result\nin slow growth and delayed reproductive maturation lead to\nlower baseline levels of ovarian function and heightened\novarian sensitivity to ecological factors throughout life. Since\nlower levels of ovarian hormones are associated with a\nreduced probability of conception and implantation [21,22]\nand increased average inter-birth intervals [23], such a\nconservative reproductive strategy would optimise lifetime\nresource allocation, enhance survival, and ultimately increase\nfitness [18].\nAlthough there is strong theoretical support for the\ndevelopmental origin of interpopulation variation in ovarian\nfunction, empirical evidence is circumstantial. Here, we use a\nmigrant study as a natural experiment to evaluate the effects\nof environmental conditions on adult levels of ovarian\nhormonal function, and to assess whether there are any\ncritical windows during development, when changes in such\nconditions may have significant effects. The study compares\ngroups of women with similar genetic background who, as a\nresult of migration, spent their formative years in contrasting\nenvironments; namely, Sylhet, Bangladesh (lower living\nstandards), and London, England (higher living standards).\nSaliva samples were collected for analyses of both salivary\nprogesterone and oestradiol. We report here on results for\nsalivary progesterone and the implications of these results for\nreproductive function within the context of both life history\ntheory and for changing health risks for populations of\nmigrants to developed industrialised countries. Results for\nsalivary oestradiol are reported elsewhere [24,25].\nIn this study, we therefore tested the following hypotheses\nand predictions.\n(A) Early life conditions will influence adult baseline levels\nof progesterone. Prediction A: Women who migrated from\nBangladesh to the UK as children, second-generation UK-\nBangladeshis, and women of European descent will have\nhigher progesterone levels than Bangladeshi sedentees.\n(B) A positive change in environmental conditions will\nimpact developmental tempo and will be reflected in\nenhanced reproductive hormonal function. Prediction B:\nWomen who migrated as children will have an earlier\nmaturation and higher mean progesterone levels than women\nwho migrated as adults.\n(C) Alterations in conditions after maturation will not\nmodify hormonal set points established during development.\nPrediction C: Adult migrants will have baseline progesterone\nlevels that are comparable to Bangladeshi sedentees despite\ndifferences in current environmental conditions.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nBangladeshi migrants in London were selected as a study\npopulation because they originate from one of the poorest\nnations in the world with economic, developmental, and\nhealth indicators that differ substantially from those of the\nUK [26,27], accentuating the contrast between the pre- and\npostmigration environments and improving study design. For\ninstance, Bangladesh\u2019s per capita gross national product is\nonly 1.4% that of the UK, life expectancy for women is 25%\nshorter, and the prevalence of low birth weight is four times\nhigher than in the UK [26,27]. Ninety-five percent of\nBangladeshi migrants originate from a single geographical\nregion [28]\u2014Sylhet District\u2014and have low rates of inter-\nmarriage with other ethnic groups, thus reducing genetic\n\u2018\u2018noise\u2019\u2019 [29]. Bangladeshis in the UK are socioeconomically\nhomogeneous, share similar histories of migration [30,31],\nand constitute a multigenerational population that allows for\nrecruitment of individuals who entered Britain at different\nlife stages (infancy, childhood, and adulthood) [32,33].\nMost Bangladeshi migrants originate from relatively\naffluent, land-owning classes in Sylhet who live in solid\ndwellings, have access to good nutrition, and have low levels\nof energy expenditure [28]. They are not, therefore, com-\nparable to the rural, malnourished populations, such as those\nin Matlab thana studied by other researchers in Bangladesh\n(e.g., [34,35]). In addition, the diet of Sylheti migrants in\nLondon remains remarkably similar following migration due\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org May 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 5 | e1670814\nDevelopmental Effects on Progesterone\nto the availability of a wide range of fresh and frozen produce\nfrom Bangladesh in local shops and supermarkets [36].\nHowever, despite their relative affluence, Sylheti residents\nin Bangladesh still suffer from higher immune challenges due\nto poor sanitation, the effects of which are exacerbated by the\nlimited availability and poor quality of health care provision\n[37\u201339]. The towns and villages in which participants live lack\nappropriate sewage and waste disposal systems, have limited\nwater treatment capacity, and are subject to seasonal floods,\nresulting in an environment where infection and disease are\ncommon and potable water is scarce [40]. Thus, despite the\nfact that Bangladeshi migrants in the UK have socioeconomic\nindicators that reflect their socially disadvantaged position\nrelative to the general British population [31], the overall\ngood quality of the environment and access to health services,\nand a clean water supply in the UK, represent a radical\ndeparture from conditions in Sylhet. If nothing else, migrants\nto the UK are free from chronic exposure to infections [41];\nthis difference would be expected to translate into enhanced\ngrowth and maturation [42].\nEstimates available from cross-sectional studies confirm\nthis latter prediction. The growth of infants and children of\nSouth Asian background is comparable to the 1990 UK\ngrowth standards [43]. Similarly, data confirm a secular trend\ntoward increased height in succeeding generations, especially\nin females [44]. With respect to infant and child health, a\nstudy in East London, where the concentration of Banglade-\nshi migrants is highest, revealed that post-neonatal mortality\nrates for infants born to Bengali mothers between 1987 and\n1990 was 6.9 per 1,000 live births [45], one-tenth as high as the\nnational rates of 56 per 1,000 births for Bangladesh [26].\nThese indicators support the argument that women in the\npresent study are indeed likely to have experienced contrast-\ning environmental conditions during development, depend-\ning on their country of birth and the place in which they\nspent their childhood and adolescence.\nStudy Design\nThe effect of different formative environments on adult\nlevels of ovarian function was examined by comparing\nsalivary progesterone in five different groups\u2014three migrant\nand two reference groups. Migrant groups included (A) first-\ngeneration migrants (n \u00bc 56) who spent their infancy and\nchildhood in Bangladesh but moved to the UK as adults\n(postmenarche); (B) first-generation migrants (n\u00bc 42) born in\nBangladesh but who moved to the UK as infants or children\n(premenarche); and (C) second-generation women (n \u00bc 33)\nconceived, born, and raised in the UK whose parents had\noriginally migrated from Bangladesh. Reference groups\ncontained (4) Bangladeshi women (n \u00bc 48) born, raised, and\nresident in Bangladesh (sedentees); and (5) women of Euro-\npean descent (n \u00bc 48) living in London neighbourhoods\nsimilar to those of the Bangladeshis, whose parents, and at\nleast both grandmothers, were born in the UK.\nRecruitment Procedure\nSylhet District in northeastern Bangladesh was chosen as\nthe target area for recruitment of Bangladeshi sedentees\nbecause over 95% of migrants to the UK originate from this\nregion [28]. The majority of participants (91%) were from\nSylhet town (285,300 inhabitants), the biggest settlement in\nthe District, with fewer subjects from the villages of Barokote\nand Uttar Royghar in Golapganj thana (about 15 km\nsoutheast of Sylhet town). All women were contacted through\nnetworking and word of mouth by a team of bilingual\n(Sylheti\u2013English) research assistants.\nIn London, Bangladeshi women were contacted by bilin-\ngual workers at local schools, community centres, mosques,\nand sports centres in the boroughs of Tower Hamlets (East\nLondon) and Camden, where the London population of\nBangladeshis is primarily concentrated [46]. Women of\nEuropean descent were recruited mainly through advertise-\nments in local Camden and East London newspapers.\nParticipants\nParticipants were well nourished, healthy, regularly men-\nstruating women (i.e., never or rarely missing a menses and\nmenstrual cycles between 23 and 37 d in length) of\nreproductive age (19\u201339 y), with no clinical history of\ndiabetes, infertility, thyroid, or reproductive disorders, and\nwho were not currently (or for the past 3 mo) pregnant,\nlactating, or using steroid-based contraceptives. These cri-\nteria were designed to screen out women whose steroid levels\nwould be altered by certain pathologies, reproductive\nconditions, or exogenous hormones. Except for the occa-\nsional short visit to Bangladesh, all first-generation migrant\nwomen had lived in the UK uninterruptedly since arrival.\nSimilarly, Sylheti, second-generation Bangladeshi women and\nwomen of European descent had lived continuously in\nBangladesh or the UK, respectively. None of the participants\nwas genetically related.\nSample Collection and Hormonal Analyses\nA pilot study was first conducted to assess potential\ncontamination of saliva samples from chewing betel nut\n[47], a common practice among Bangladeshis in the UK [48].\nCollection protocols were then adjusted to ensure that betel\nchewers waited at least 1 h after chewing before expecto-\nration. Women were similarly asked not to eat, drink (other\nthan water), or brush their teeth for 1 h prior to sample\ncollection, to avoid sample contamination. Participants\ncollected daily saliva samples for the duration of a menstrual\ncycle starting on the first day of menses. Women were\nencouraged to collect samples at roughly the same time of\nday. These consisted of 5 ml of saliva collected in polystyrene\ntubes pretreated with sodium azide as a preservative to a final\nconcentration of approximately 0.1%. A sugarless spearmint-\nflavoured gum was used as salivary stimulant. This gum has\nbeen extensively tested and does not interfere with analyses\nof salivary steroids [49]. Saliva was assayed for progesterone\nusing standardised radioimmunoassay techniques [49]. Intra-\nand interassay coefficient variations were 11.6% and 14.7%,\nrespectively. Assay sensitivity was 15 pg\/ml. All data are\npresented in pg\/ml.\nAt the end of the menstrual cycle for which saliva samples\nwere collected, anthropometric measurements (height,\nweight, and skinfolds) were taken following standard proce-\ndures [50] and two questionnaires (general sociodemographic\nand food frequency) were administered on a one-to-one basis\nin either English or Bengali by a bilingual female researcher.\nA small proportion (15%) of participants in the European-\ndescent group completed their own questionnaires and\nreturned them to the researchers by surface mail. These data\nwere used to make intergroup comparisons and to evaluate\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org May 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 5 | e1670815\nDevelopmental Effects on Progesterone\nchanges in standards of living, diet, health, reproductive\npatterns, and lifestyle sequential to the migration experience.\nStatistical Analyses\nMean progesterone values for the last 14 d of the menstrual\ncycle (luteal phase) were calculated as a quantitative index of\novarian function following standard procedures [17]. Indi-\nvidual luteal progesterone indices were pooled, and averages\nper group calculated. Indices were log transformed to reduce\npositive skewness. Group differences in luteal progesterone\nindices and the effects of anthropometric and reproductive\nvariables were evaluated by standard multiple linear regres-\nsion models. Age, body mass index, height, and age at\nmenarche were entered as independent variables using\ncontinuous and simple linear terms. \u2018\u2018Group\u2019\u2019 was entered\nas a categorical variable using sedentees as the reference.\nPearson\u2019s correlation was used to examine the relationships\nbetween: (A) Age on arrival to theUKwith age atmenarche and\nsteroid levels; (B) time spent in the UK and steroid levels\namong women who migrated after puberty; and (C) steroid\nlevels with age at menarche. For the former analysis, all first\ngeneration (Bangladesh-born) women in the study were\nclassified according to whether their age on arrival was\nyounger or older than themaximum recorded age atmenarche\n(16 y). Women who arrived in the UK at ages 16 y or younger\nwere thus classified as \u2018\u2018child\u2019\u2019 migrants, whereas those who\nentered the country at older ages (.16 y) were categorised as\n\u2018\u2018adults.\u2019\u2019Bangladeshi womenwhomigrated prior tomenarche\nwere then divided into two groups according to age at\nmigration: (0\u20138 y; n\u00bc 22) and (\u00029 y; n\u00bc 17). The transition at\n8 y was chosen to approximate the growth period prior to\nadrenarche, when critical endocrinological changes occur as a\nprecursor to adolescent hormonal development [51]. Differ-\nences in luteal progesterone indices between these two\ncategories were analysed by general linearmodels. Significance\nlevel was set at p , 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed\nusing SPSS v. 10.0 (http:\/\/www.spss.com).\nResearch Ethics\nResearch protocols were approved by the Ethics Commit-\ntees of University College London Hospital, Camden;\nIslington Local Health Authority, East London; and the City\nLocal Health Authority and Sylhet Osmani Medical College,\nBangladesh. Written informed consent was obtained from all\nparticipants in the study. All data were collected and stored\nin compliance with the Data Protection Act, UK.\nResults\nMultiple linear regression models showed significant differ-\nences in luteal progesterone levels between groups (F9,178 \u00bc\n5.05, p , 0.001, standard error of the mean [SEM] \u00bc 0.32;\nadjusted R2 \u00bc 0.16) (Table 1). Average luteal progesterone\nvalues, controlling for anthropometric and reproductive\nvariables, were significantly higher in the child migrant,\nsecond-generation, and European-descent groups (75%, 81%,\nand 103%, respectively) than those for sedentees. In contrast,\nno significant differences in average progesterone indices\nbetween adult migrants and sedentees were found (Figure 1;\nTable 1). Average steroid levels and maturation age were\nnegatively correlated across groups (r\u00bc\u00030.17, p\u00bc0.02, n\u00bc198).\nFor child migrants, age at migration was significantly\ncorrelated with menarcheal age (r \u00bc 0.31, p \u00bc 0.03, n \u00bc 39).\nSimilarly, age at migration was negatively correlated with\naverage luteal progesterone values among women who\nmigrated prior to menarche (r \u00bc\u00030.28, p \u00bc 0.04, n \u00bc39), but\nwas not significantly correlated among postmenarcheal\n(adult) migrants (r \u00bc 0.16, p \u00bc 0.33, n \u00bc 46). Furthermore,\nwomen who migrated during infancy and early childhood\n(ages 0\u20138 y) had a significantly earlier age at menarche (F2,86\u00bc\n3.21, p \u00bc 0.03), were significantly taller (F2,88 \u00bc 3.7, p \u00bc 0.01),\nand had, after controlling for age, anthropometric and\nreproductive variables, higher average luteal progesterone\n(F2,81\u00bc 3.14, p\u00bc 0.04) than those who migrated at a later stage\n(including child migrants from age 9 y to menarche, and adult\nmigrants) (Figure 2).\nFinally, among women who migrated after menarche,\nlength of time spent in the UK had no significant impact\non luteal progesterone levels (r \u00bc\u00030.20, p \u00bc 0.18, n \u00bc 46).\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge this is the first study to show that adult\nreproductive steroid levels in women are influenced by\nTable 1.

Bangladeshi women who spent\ntheir childhood in Bangladesh\u2014whether sedentees or adult\nmigrants\u2014had significantly lower levels of salivary progester-\none and a slower maturational trajectory than did Banglade-\nshi women and women of European descent who grew up in\nLondon.\nFrom a life history perspective it would be adaptive to\nadjust developmental trajectories to changing levels of energy\nthat favour reproduction above basic maintenance costs. In\nthis study, progesterone profiles as well as height and\nmenarcheal age\u2014both proxies of developmental tempo\u2014\nrespond positively to improved environmental conditions\nduring childhood. These simultaneous effects suggest that\ngrowth, maturation, and ovarian function are linked to an\noverall programme of energy allocation moderated by\nassessing environmental impacts including nutrition, energy\nexpenditure, and immunological stressors, and possibly\nmediated through metabolic hormones such as insulin and\/\nor insulin-like growth factors operating either directly on the\novary, or via the hypothalamus, or both [19,52].\nThat the period of early postnatal life is critical for the\nestablishment of growth and maturation trajectories has been\nidentified in other studies [10,42]. The shift in regulatory and\nsecretory patterns in various metabolic and endocrine axes\nduring infancy, likely in coordination with neurological\ndevelopment, may mediate the observed effects of improved\nenvironmental quality on trajectories of development [53].\nEthnographic, anthropometric, and dietary data for the\nrelatively affluent Bangladeshi women who participated in\nthe study indicate that the taxing maintenance costs for the\nwomen who grew up in Sylhet, which result in lower levels of\novarian function, are not primarily linked to nutritional\nfactors and\/or heavy physical workloads as demonstrated in\nother populations [54]. Instead, the lower levels of salivary\nprogesterone are likely related to the chronic immune\nchallenges associated with high pathogen loads and infectious\nexposures [37,39,41].\nLinks between epidemiological factors and chronic energy\navailability have been widely documented. For instance,\nchronic morbidity has been shown to have a negative impact\non growth and maturation [55\u201357], even in conditions of\nadequate nutrition [58]. Furthermore, analysis of historical\ndata from four northern European countries has revealed an\nassociation between increased adult height and reduced old-\nage mortality related to a lifetime reduction of infection and\ninflammation [59]. Similarly, the secular trend towards earlier\nmaturation in humans finds its closest correlate with the\ndeclining mortality rates of the demographic transition\n(underscored by a dramatic shift in patterns of morbidity)\n[60]. Together these findings fit the prediction of life history\ntheory, namely that individuals developing in a high morbid-\nity environment would have to trade off survival at high\nenergetic costs (through the maintenance of a chronically\nstimulated immune function) for a slower developmental\ntrajectory with restricted growth, late maturation, and,\nconsequently, lower levels of ovarian function.\nIt is possible that lower levels of progesterone described\nhere in the adult and child migrant groups might be related\neither to the stress of migration, or of participation in a\nproject where saliva is collected and where there is a lack of\nfamiliarity with this procedure [61]. If this were the case, then\nwe would expect levels of progesterone to be higher among\nadult migrants who have lived in the UK for longer periods of\nFigure 1.

Sample sizes include only the cycles for which an oestradiol\nmidcycle peak and luteal progesterone rise were discernable (81%, 82%, 93%, 88%, and 94% of the original sample for SYL, ADU, CHI, 2ndGEN, and WHI\ngroups, respectively). Oestradiol values were obtained from data available for the same individual menstrual cycles. Ovulation dates were estimated\nfrom individual oestradiol data [22]. Confidence intervals are omitted for visual clarity. Sample sizes include all women for which hormonal data were\navailable and may differ from total sample sizes for other aspects of data collection.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.0040167.g001\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org May 2007 | Volume 4 | Issue 5 | e1670817\nDevelopmental Effects on Progesterone\ntime (controlling for age). However, we do not observe such a\ntrend in the data. Moreover, information collected from our\nextensive questionnaires, as well as discussions with many\nBangladeshi migrants, reveal that child migrants and second-\ngeneration women are exposed to more daily stressors than\nadult migrants. The former two groups are caught between\ntwo cultures, having been raised in the UK but still remaining\nembedded within the Bangladeshi community. Most child\nmigrants and second-generation women hold jobs but still\nhave many household tasks to complete at home. Many are\nmarried to men who were raised in Bangladesh but migrated\nto the UK to be their spouse; this often leads to family\ntensions. In our study 26% of second-generation women and\n19% of child migrants were the sole breadwinners for the\nfamily, where their first-generation husbands might not have\neither the language or technical skills to obtain and retain\nviable employment in the UK. Again, given these stresses, we\nwould expect that child migrants and second-generation\nwomen would have lower, rather than the observed higher\nlevels of progesterone compared to adult migrants who are\nnot exposed to these cultural tensions and work-related\nstresses [62].\nIt is difficult to determine how lower levels of progesterone\nmight translate into differences in fecundity and fertility. In a\nstudy undertaken in rural highland Bolivia and Chicago that\ncompared the fecundity of Aymara and US women, the\nformer were able to conceive and maintain pregnancies at\nsignificantly lower levels of salivary progesterone than the\nlatter [21,63]. However, there remain substantial differences\nin the reproductive status and behaviour of these two groups\nof women. Specifically, the Aymara are effectively a natural\nfertility population with negligible rates of contraceptive use;\nmany women in this particular study conceived following\nperiods of lactational amenorrhoea subsequent to prior\npregnancies. This is in sharp contrast to the US women from\nChicago, who were actively planning pregnancies and often\nusing behavioural strategies to optimise the possibility of\nconception (such as timing of intercourse, ovulation pre-\ndictor kits, and so forth).\nIn another study conducted among US women of European\ndescent attempting to conceive, intra- and interindividual\ncomparisons between naturally occurring conception and\nexposed nonconception cycles revealed that midfollicular\nsalivary oestradiol levels were highly correlated with the\nprobability of successful conception [22]. Similarly, salivary\nprogesterone levels during the late midluteal phase (the\npresumed time of implantation) were significantly higher in\nconception cycles than in exposed nonconception ones\n[22,64]. Similar results were obtained for urinary oestrogen\nand progesterone metabolites among Chinese women [65].\nThese findings suggest that fecundability (the monthly\nprobability of conception) would be lower among women\nwith generally lower average levels of salivary progesterone.\nLower fecundability in cycles with lower reproductive steroid\nlevels would certainly be in accordance with expectations\nfrom life history theory. To test whether these expectations\napply to the Bangladeshi population here would require\nfurther study of reproductive steroid levels during both\nconception and nonconception cycles.\nThe critical developmental phase in which improved\nconditions affect adult progesterone levels in our study of\nBangladeshi migrants occurs prior to age 8 y. As mentioned\nearlier, adrenarche occurs at approximately this age, is\nassociated with the onset of adrenal androgen production\npresaging puberty, and is a process significant in the timing\nof reproductive maturation [53]. In essence, this period may\nrepresent a last \u2018\u2018checkpoint\u2019\u2019 for women at which to assess\nenvironmental conditions and adjust developmental trajec-\ntories accordingly. Further work on adrenal androgens and\novarian steroid hormones during childhood and adolescence\nin Bangladeshi migrants and sedentees will shed more light\nFigure 2.

The findings\nreported here of a postuterine, childhood phase during which\nadult set points of salivary progesterone can be affected adds\na new dimension to the study of the aetiology and\nepidemiology of women\u2019s reproductive health in later life.\nIn addition, these results are relevant in assessing differential\npotential health risks associated with ovarian steroid hor-\nmone production that might be sequential to the migration\nexperience.\nOne such health risk is the development of breast cancer.\nOvarian steroid hormones have been identified as important\nfactors in the development and prognosis of this pathology\n[67,68]. At the cellular level, both oestradiol and progesterone\nact as potent mitogens in normal and neoplastic breast tissue\n[69]. At an epidemiological level, although the evidence for an\nassociation between high levels of progesterone and a high\nrisk of breast cancer is less consistent than it is for oestrogens,\nthere are correlational data that point to a strong positive\nrelationship between average progesterone values and breast\ncancer incidence rates [70]. Thus, we suggest that the\nsignificant increase in chronic progesterone levels among\nmigrant women documented here may result in higher breast\ncancer risk in subsequent generations of this community.\nThis projection is also substantiated by a number of other\nphysiological and behavioural changes that occur among\nSouth Asian women consequent to migration including an\nearlier menarche, earlier age at first birth, and a dramatic\nreduction in breast-feeding practices [62,71].\nFor South Asian women (a group that includes Indians,\nPakistanis, and Bangladeshis) in the UK, there is a series of\nepidemiological studies that already document a transition in\nbreast cancer incidence profiles. For example, a recent study\nin Leicester, a city with a large South Asian community,\nfound that breast cancer rates among South Asians have\nincreased over the last ten years while they have decreased in\nthe non-Asian population [72]. Moreover, there is evidence to\nsuggest that the increased risk for breast cancer is currently\nmore marked for those age groups that include a substantial\nproportion of women actually born in the UK or who\nmigrated during childhood [73]. Our data on generational\ntrends in hormonal and developmental risk factors among\nprecisely these migrant categories are congruent with these\nage cohort differentials in breast cancer incidence rates\nobserved at the epidemiological level.\nThese findings add to accumulating evidence that humans\nhave an evolved capacity to respond to chronic environ-\nmental conditions during growth that optimise resource\nallocation. This optimisation, however, may lead to specific\ndevelopmental trajectories that compromise health in later\nlife [74]. We show here that environmental conditions\nconducive to enhanced growth and maturation correlate\nwith a suite of anthropometric, endocrine, and reproductive\ncharacteristics associated with high set points of ovarian\nfunction that could ultimately increase breast cancer risk.\nThese results are pertinent not only to the Bangladeshi group\nwe studied, but to many other migrant groups and popula-\ntions in transition due to globalising forces. We believe,\ntherefore, that in the face of increasing rural to urban and\ninternational migration worldwide, our reproductive hormo-\nnal findings could have potentially broad public health\nimplications.\nSupporting Information\nAlternative Language Abstract S1.

Women\u2019s reproductive biology\u2014which includes levels of\nsex hormones at different stages of the menstrual cycle\u2014is known to\nvary greatly depending on the environment. This variation can be\nmeasured by looking at the levels of certain reproductive hormones in\nthe saliva, for example, progesterone and estradiol. The levels of these\nhormones differ greatly from individual to individual. Women who live in\nenvironments where less food is available or infections are more\ncommon, or who do more physical work seem to have lower levels of\nthese hormones compared to other women. Because these differences\nseem to persist over the long term, some researchers have suggested\nthat various factors relating to an individual\u2019s environment early in life\nhave a strong influence on later fertility. This theory is based on ideas\ndrawn from evolutionary biology and ecology. Theoretically, a woman\nwho limits her future fertility as a biological response to poor\nenvironments would eventually have greater evolutionary success than\nan individual who remains fertile in harsh conditions. Although the\nlogical basis for this idea is attractive, there is not very much evidence\nthat it is true.\nWhy Was This Study Done? In this study, the researchers wanted to\ncollect experimental evidence from human populations that would help\nthem test the hypothesis outlined above. The study performed here\nmade use of a \u2018\u2018natural experiment\u2019\u2019 resulting from widespread\nmigration of people from Bangladesh to the UK. 95% of these individuals\ncome from one particular region of Bangladesh, Sylhet. People would\nexperience extensive differences between the environments before and\nafter migration, including economic factors, access to health services,\nexposure to infectious diseases, and so on. Therefore, a comparison of\nhormone levels between individuals who had migrated at different\nperiods during their life might help to test the theory that early\nenvironmental factors affect later fertility.\nWhat Did the Researchers Do and Find? Five groups of women were\nselected and compared in this study. The groups included women who\nhad grown up in Bangladesh but moved to the UK as adults; women\nwho were born in Bangladesh but moved to the UK as children; women\nwhose parents were from Bangladesh but who were born and raised in\nthe UK; Bangladeshi women who were born and raised in Bangladesh;\nand finally a comparison group of women of European descent who\nwere born and raised in the UK. Each woman in each of the five groups\nwas asked to collect a sample of her own saliva each day for one\nmenstrual cycle. The researchers tested the saliva samples to find out the\nlevels of progesterone. The average progesterone level for the last 14\ndays of each woman\u2019s menstrual cycle (when progesterone levels are\ngenerally high) was then calculated and these values compared across\nthe five groups. In particular, the researchers looked at the relationship\nbetween the age at which an individual arrived in the UK, the time spent\nin the UK, and the progesterone levels in saliva.\nThe researchers found statistically significant differences in progesterone\nlevels between individuals who had migrated as children, second-\ngeneration migrants, and women of European descent, as compared to\nthe levels for Bangladeshi women who had never migrated and women\nwho migrated as adults. Progesterone levels for the first three groups\nwere higher than those for the Bangladeshi women who had not\nmigrated or who had migrated as adults. The age at which women\nmigrated also seemed to be linked to their progesterone levels. Amongst\nwomen who migrated before the start of menstruation, those who\nmigrated at a younger age had higher average progesterone levels.\nHowever, this relationship did not seem to hold true for women who had\nmigrated after they started menstruating.\nWhat Do These Findings Mean? This study suggests that certain\nindicators of reproductive biology, such as progesterone levels, may be\nlinked to environmental factors that an individual experiences early in\nlife. The findings support the idea that harsh environments early in\ndevelopment are associated with lower fertility later in life. However, it is\nnot clear from this study which precise environmental factors are\ninvolved; it is possible that exposure to infectious disease is important,\nbut this possibility was not specifically tested in this research study.\nFinally, it is not certain whether the lower average progesterone levels of\nthe particular groups studied would actually translate into lower fertility.\nIt is possible that although certain individuals and groups had lower\nlevels of this hormone, they may in fact have been as fertile as individuals\nwith higher levels of the hormone.\nAdditional Information.
