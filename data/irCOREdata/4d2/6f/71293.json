It shows the implications of this move in terms of\ngender prescriptions before discussing Lessing\u2019s \u2018disgust\u2019 with a particular performance of his Emilia\nGalotti. Reading this example with Lessing\u2019s treatise Laokoon and drawing on Julia Kristeva\u2019s theory\nof abjection, it argues that Lessing\u2019s struggle with the performers reveals a profound crisis in subject\nformation in the sense that the disturbing corporality of the performing body is always threatening\nsympathetic identification. The article concludes that the Dramaturgie itself constitutes an \u2018abjection\u2019\nof performance. A postscript opens up the view onto the contemporary relevance and refiguration of\nLessing\u2019s Laokoon in the Laokoon Festival in Hamburg.\nThe eighteenth-century dramatist, critic, translator and aesthetic theorist Gotthold\nEphraim Lessing sits comfortably enthroned on a pedestal in one of the main squares,\nthe Ga\u00a8nsemarkt, in Hamburg (Fig. 1). This monument to him is the only reminder\nof a barn-like theatre that once stood here and of the short-lived enterprise of the\n\u2018Hamburgische Nationaltheater\u2019 (Hamburg National Theatre) from 1767 to 1769, which\nwas the first \u2018standing\u2019 (i.e. non-touring) bourgeois theatre in Germany. Lessing had\nbeen commissioned as the in-house playwright and official critic or \u2018dramaturg\u2019 for\nthis enterprise. The other lasting \u2018monument\u2019 \u2013 which I would like to study here as\na document , however \u2013 is the resulting famous Hamburgische Dramaturgie (Hamburg\nDramaturgy) itself, a text which has been called the \u2018first book of Moses of German\ntheatre criticism\u20191 and which has led theatre historians to inscribe Lessing as the \u2018first\ndramaturg\u2019.2\nI propose to read this work in the context of a historical transition to an increasingly\ntext-oriented culture with an accelerating book market and a growing reading public\n(significantly Lessing started his own publishing company to bring out the serialized\nHamburgische Dramaturgie). The Dramaturgie occupied a crucial position in a process\nwhich increasingly forced actors to cater to a literary theatre and in which the theatre\nserved as a training ground for potential readers (bearing in mind that even around\n1800 about 80 per cent of the German population were still illiterate). Self-disciplined\nactors like Conrad Ekhof, who studied Lessing\u2019s writing on the theatre and founded\n20 ju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy\nFig. 1 Gotthold Ephraim Lessing on a pedestal in the Ga\u00a8nsemarkt in Hamburg, the site of the\nHamburgische Nationaltheater from 1767 to 1769. The monument by Fritz Schaper was erected in 1881.\n(Photo: Hans-Joachim Ju\u00a8rs.)\nGermany\u2019s first \u2018Actors\u2019 Academy\u2019, for their part tried hard to accommodate their art\nto the new requirements of being judged according to their embodiment of a script, of\nbeing physically \u2018readerly\u2019 \u2013 and criticizable. In Ekhof \u2019s concluding address to his Actors\u2019\nAcademy, he summarized the qualifications actors should bring to their profession:\nju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy 21\n\u2018namely: reading and writing; a good memory; studiousness; an untiring drive to become\never more perfect; and the strength not to become either proud through flattering praise\nor frightened through unreasonable reproach\u2019.3\nNowadays, we may (still) take such literacy for granted. Modern actor training\nassumes the actors\u2019 ability to study and memorize text, to follow written stage directions,\nas well as their willingness to be judged according to the printed play script and to\nperfect their performances in response to printed reviews. But earlier forms of actor\ntraining in Europe put more emphasis on physical agility and virtuosity, stock postures,\nand proper declamation. Acting in the age of a growing textual culture demanded\na complete reorientation. Theoretical writings on the theatre, aesthetic treatises like\nLessing\u2019s Laokoon (1766), and not least of all more elaborate stage directions were\nincreasingly trying to legislate ideal physical representations against which the actual\nperformances were measured. As I shall argue here, these ideal representations were\nprescribed according to whether or not they allowed for the spectator\u2019s subject formation\nthrough sympathetic identification with the main protagonists. In this way Lessing\nattempted to turn the \u2018gestalt\u2019 of the actor into a Lacanian mirror for the spectator,\nleaving the actor confronting the problem of trying to live up to the critic\u2019s demand.\nI shall approach the relationship between text, performance, and spectator\/reader\nby way of looking at Lessing\u2019s problematic relationship with the performing body. In\nthe first part I explore the ideological implications of the fact that Lessing\u2019s later work,\nespecially the Hamburgische Dramaturgie, despite his better intentions, eventually moves\naway from discussing actual performances. In the second part I discuss Lessing\u2019s \u2018disgust\u2019\nwith one particular performance example (reported to him by Eva Ko\u00a8nig from Vienna)\nby reading it with Lessing\u2019s Laokoon, a media-theoretical treatise which in many ways is\na companion text to the Hamburgische Dramaturgie. In my analysis I shall be drawing\non Julia Kristeva\u2019s theory of abjection, as well as recent Kristevan Lessing scholarship.\nAnd, finally, I will argue that Lessing\u2019s shift away from a discussion of performance\ncan itself be understood as a strategy of abjection designed to subdue the \u2018disgusting\u2019\nand disturbing corporeality of the actor. Rather than being just a matter of professional\ndisagreement, I will contend here that Lessing\u2019s struggle with the actors and in particular\nthe actresses reveals a more fundamental crisis in aesthetics and subject formation, in the\nsense that the excesses of the performing body remain a constant threat to the desired\nsubject formation through sympathetic identification.\nFrom actual bodies to textual bodies\nBut I am again lapsing into the critique of the play, and I wanted to talk about the\nactor.4\nMy starting point is the curious fact that in the Hamburgische Dramaturgie Lessing\nsoon moves away from discussing actual performances, despite the fact that he had\nannounced that it was to be a \u2018critical index of all plays to be performed and accompany\nevery step which art, the playwright\u2019s as much as the actor\u2019s, will take here\u2019.5 Especially the\nactor, Lessing had said, could demand strict and unbiased attention because, unlike the\nplaywright\u2019s work which can always be consulted again, \u2018the art of the actor is transitory\n22 ju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy\nin its works\u2019.6 Furthermore, the actor is described as a creative artist in his (sic!) own\nright and an absolutely vital supplement to the art of the poet: \u2018He has to think along with\nthe poet; where the poet has met with something human, he has to think for the poet.\u20197\nIn the comments themselves, however, Lessing increasingly fails to keep up with his\ncritique of the performances, his reviews increasingly lag behind the actual activity of\nthe theatre, and eventually Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgie covers only the first fourteen weeks of\nproduction out of the almost two years of existence of the Hamburg National Theatre!8\nMoreover, references to the actual performances of specific actors become increasingly\nsparse and after the twenty-fifth piece cease entirely. Of this part of the task, Lessing\nadmits in the concluding piece, \u2018I was very soon weary.\u20199 (The German word here is\n\u2018u\u00a8berdru\u00a8ssig \u2019 and implies a sense of tired disgust \u2013 a response to the actors to which I will\nreturn later).\nOne of the reasons why Lessing stops writing about performances was the resistance\nof the actors, and particularly the actresses to his critical comments. The actress Susanne\nMecour made it a condition of her contract that she should not be criticized at all,10\nwhile the chief actress of the company, Sophie Friederike Hensel, emphatically resented\nLessing\u2019s criticism of her physique in the role of Cenie. Lessing had written: \u2018The actress\nis too big for the role, I feel like I am watching a giant exercising with the gun of a cadet.\u201911\nMadame Hensel also resented a lack of critical mentions and \u2018insinuated that Lessing\npaid insufficient attention to the performances of the actors; that he walked restlessly\nabout, or stayed at the buffet while whole acts were being played, only looking now and\nthen through the open door at the parterre\u2019.12\nYet, until Lessing\u2019s confession at the very end, this tension between Lessing and the\nactors is all but hidden in the text of the Dramaturgie. What reveals it, yet at the same\ntime masks it, is a crucial shift: Lessing resorts to discussing the plays rather than their\nperformances and by a sleight-of-hand discusses dramatic characters as though they were\nperformers. So the actor, in the beginning still acknowledged as a co-producer of a play\u2019s\nmeaning, has been replaced by his or her double, the character, who is endowed with a\nvirtual, imaginary body and treated as a quasi-material being.13 What has happened is\nthat the performer who rules the visual, audible and sensory but, alas, transitory present,\nhas been rendered invisible not only by the playwright but also by the critic, both of\nwhom rule the permanence of the script.\nWithin the Dramaturgie the shift towards a discussion of plays and characters serves\nthe purpose of prescribing ideal representations which would allow for the sympathetic\nidentification of the bourgeois spectator. As I would now like to show, this has ideological\nconsequences especially for the representation of gender roles. For along with the shift\nfrom performances to plays, we can observe a semantic and functional shift in Lessing\u2019s\nuse of the terms \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018nature\u2019. While in the earlier parts the word is used to mean\nsomething like \u2018empirically studied\u2019, \u2018realistic\u2019 or \u2018easily readable\u2019, in the later parts it takes\non a more ideological connotation, which also has recourse to the early enlightenment\nmeaning of \u2018nature\u2019 as an a priori order manifesting divine reason.14\nThus, for example, when Lessing still considers performances he discusses how\nan actress playing Elisabeth in Thomas Corneille\u2019s Comte d\u2019Essex \u2013 depending on her\nju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy 23\nfigure, voice, and gaze \u2013 could only ever embody either the proud monarch or the tender\nwoman:\nElizabeth is as tender as she is proud; I willingly believe that a female heart can be both\nat once; but how an actress can represent both equally well is something I do not quite\ncomprehend. In nature itself we do not trust a proud woman to have much tenderness\nor a tender one to have much pride. We do not trust her to have it, I say, because the\nsigns of the one contradict the signs of the other.15\nLessing\u2019s semiotic argument here is that the performance of pride and tenderness would\nproduce contradictory physical signifiers and therefore would not add up to a coherent,\nunified reading \u2013 even though they may coexist \u2018in a female heart\u2019.\nBy way of discussing the physiognomy of potential actresses (Robertson speculates\nthat he has Madame Hensel and Madame Lo\u00a8wen in mind respectively16), Lessing goes\non to ask how an actress could \u2018go further than nature\u2019:\nIf she is of a majestic build, if her voice sounds fuller and more masculine, if her gaze\nis bold, her movements quick and valiant, then she will succeed very well in the proud\npassages; but how about the tender ones? Yet if her figure is less imposing, if gentleness\nreigns in her mien, a modest fire in her eyes, in her voice more euphony than emphasis,\nif in her movements there is more decency and dignity than force and spirit, then she\nwill do complete justice to the tender passages; but to the proud ones?17\nEven though the \u2018proud monarch\u2019 is still an option, Lessing already favours the \u2018tender\nwoman\u2019, the gendered portrayal, arguing also that a \u2018doubling of the male character\u2019 has\nto be avoided:\nEssex is proud, and if Elizabeth is to be proud, too, than at least she has to be proud in\na different way. If in the earl the tenderness can not but be subordinated to the pride,\nthen in the queen the tenderness has to outweigh the pride.18\nThe call for contrasting roles here seamlessly changes into a call for polarized gender\ncharacters which reflect but also produce and disseminate the newly emerging polarized\ngender roles in bourgeois society.19 Elizabeth is to be seen more in her private sphere\nof feeling rather than her public role as a monarch. And if one had the choice between\nan actress who could express \u2018the offended queen with all her threatening seriousness,\nwith all the terror of vengeful majesty\u2019 (e.g. Madame Hensel) or one who could express\nthe \u2018jealous lover, with all her injured feelings of unrequited love, with all her readiness\nto forgive the dear offender, with all her anxiety at his obstinacy, with all her woe at his\nloss\u2019 (e.g. Madame Lo\u00a8wen) then surely, Lessing concludes, one would have to go with the\nlatter actress.20 By way of a casting recommendation and censoring of certain imposing\nbodies, Lessing would thus effect a virtual rewriting of a classical tragedy of revenge and\naristocratic power into a sentimental bourgeois tragedy.\nBy the time Lessing writes about Pierre Corneille\u2019s Rodugune \u2013 in the meantime\nhaving given up writing about the performers \u2013 he uses the term \u2018natural\u2019 in an outright\nideological and normative fashion. Lessing criticizes Corneille for not letting Cleopatra\n24 ju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy\nslay her husband simply out of jealousy, for wanting to make her more \u2018sublime\u2019 by\nintroducing the motif of her ambition to hold on to the throne:\nQuite right; far more sublime and \u2013 far more unnatural. For to begin with, pride in\ngeneral is a more unnatural, more artificial vice than jealousy. Secondly the pride of a\nwoman is even more unnatural than the pride of a man. Nature equipped the female\nsex for love, not for violence; it is to awaken tenderness, not fear; only its charms are to\nrender it powerful; it should rule only through caresses and it should not desire to rule\nover more than it can enjoy.21\nThe meaning of \u2018natural\u2019 here no longer refers primarily to observable reality but to an\nabstract ideal or \u2018rule\u2019. A woman who \u2018likes ruling merely for its own sake\u2019, in whom \u2018all\ninclinations are subordinated to ambition\u2019, \u2018such a woman may once have existed, even\nmore than once\u2019, Lessing admits, \u2018but she is nevertheless an exception; and the one who\ndepicts the exception indisputably depicts the less natural\u2019. This \u2018natural\u2019 rule is anchored\nin \u2018nature\u2019 as a god-given order and biological destiny which \u2018equips\u2019 the female sex with\ncertain traits and for certain tasks (\u2018love\u2019). If Thomas Corneille\u2019s Elizabeth was a semiotic\nmonstrosity in her doubleness, then Pierre Corneille\u2019s Cleopatra is now \u2018a monster of\nher sex\u2019.22\nWhile Lessing\u2019s agenda in these examples is to dismantle the hegemony of French\nclassical tragedy and its absolutist values, the battleground for this ideological quarrel\nis often the representation and \u2018nature\u2019 of women. The price to be paid for the\nrepresentation of bourgeois values and for the possibility of the spectator\u2019s sympathetic\nidentification with the protagonists is a much more limited gender and stage role for\nwomen. And although it is no longer the performer but now the playwright who is\ndirectly held responsible for the production of meaning, the performer is indirectly\ncensored through the critique of her double, the character.\nThe Hamburgische Dramaturgie is in effect an attempt to rule the \u2018performance\ntext\u2019 (as semioticians are fond of calling the concrete staging23) from afar through the\ndramatic text and its dramaturgical interpretation. This desired subordination of the\nactor to the text is later famously captured by Diderot in the image of the great actor as\n\u2018a most ingenious puppet . . . his strings held by the poet who at each line indicates the\ntrue form he must take\u2019.24 Diderot goes on to admonish the writers: \u2018he who leaves least\nto the imagination of the great actor is the greatest poet\u2019.25 And it is not coincidental\nthat in their own plays Diderot and Lessing (who translated Diderot\u2019s early writings into\nGerman) for this purpose pioneer very precise prescriptive stage directions for the actors\u2019\ngestural and mimic play. As a study by Victoria Pfeil has shown, while Lessing\u2019s early\nplays contain fewer and more general stage directions, significantly there is a marked\nincrease in the number and specificity of stage directions in the plays published in the\ntime leading up to the Dramaturgie.26\nBut is the prescription of an ideal staging not inevitably doomed to failure? Will\nthe performer not always threaten to be \u2018too big for the role\u2019? Will the materiality\nof body and voice not inevitably exceed the dramatic text when the linguistic sign\nsystem of the literary theatre is translated into the sign system of bodies in time and\nspace? Will the performer as the double of the character not return with a vengeance?\nju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy 25\nThere are numerous indications that during and after the Hamburgische Dramaturgie\nLessing becomes increasingly disillusioned with the theatrical embodiment of plays\nby contemporary performers. He longs for a precise corporeal eloquence (\u2018ko\u00a8rperliche\nBeredsamkeit\u2019), a strictly coded art of acting as he thinks the ancient Greeks used to have\nwith their chironomia, their \u2018language of the hands\u2019, but \u2018of this whole language,\u2019 he\nwrites in the Dramaturgie,\nwe seem to have retained nothing but an inarticulate screaming, nothing but the power\nto make movements without knowing how to give these movements a fixed meaning\nand how to combine them with each other so that they are capable not only of one\nindividual sense but of a coherent meaning.27\nFive years later in 1774 he confides to his brother that his intermittent \u2018little fits of\ntheatre\u2019 were usually followed by \u2018the most extreme disgust at everything that is and is\ncalled theatre and theatrical\u2019.28 This repeatedly surfacing reaction of \u2018disgust\u2019 at theatrical\nrepresentation and its ensuing management through a process of textual transformation\nand abjection is precisely what I would now like to explore. I would like to contend\nhere that Lessing\u2019s disgust with the performers marks a profound crisis in aesthetics and\nsubject formation, in the sense that the material excess of the performing body threatens\nthe spectator\u2019s desired subject formation \u2013 a process which is at the heart of Lessing\u2019s\naesthetics of sympathy (Mitleidsa\u00a8sthetik).\nAbject bodies and disturbed sympathy\nA graphic example of a disgust arousing performance is to be found in a letter sent to\nLessing from Vienna by his fiance\u00b4e Eva Ko\u00a8nig in 1772. Complaining about the unbearably\n\u2018affected\u2019 actor Stephanie in a performance of Lessing\u2019s own Emilia Galotti she writes:\nAnd what was the last thing he did [as the prince] in your play? He opens his mouth \u2013\nwhich is huge anyway \u2013 all the way to the ears, mightily sticks out his long tongue from\nthis throat and licks the blood of the dagger with which Emilia has been stabbed. What\nmight he want to achieve with this? Arouse disgust? If that is it, then he has succeeded.29\nHow could we theorize this example \u2013 which among other things further\nproblematizes the gender politics at work in Lessing\u2019s relationship with performance? I\npropose to read this performance example with Lessing\u2019s most systematic aesthetic essay,\nLaokoon oder u\u00a8ber die Grenzen der Malerei und Poesie (Laocoo\u00a8n: An Essay on the Limits of\nPainting and Poetry, published shortly before the Dramaturgy in 1766), which is essentially\na treatise on the aesthetic rules or \u2018limits\u2019 governing the ancient Greek representation\nof the human body in different artistic media, a treatise aimed at legislating how the\nbody ought to be represented by modern artists. These aesthetic rules are intricately\nbound up with a theory of subject formation, as they articulate when the viewer, reader,\nor spectator can sympathize and identify with the represented bodies and when this is\nmade impossible by the way they are represented. Following on from recent Lessing\nscholarship by Susan Gustafson and Dorothea von Mu\u00a8cke, but unlike them attending to\nLessing in terms of performance rather than literature or literary drama, I shall focus\n26 ju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy\nFig. 2 The Laokoon group, Vatican museum, Rome. (Photo: private collection.)\non how Lessing deals with the disruptive aspects of corporeality and relate Lessing\u2019s\naesthetic and dramatic production to Jacques Lacan\u2019s theory of subject formation and\nJulia Kristeva\u2019s theory of abjection.30\nEva Ko\u00a8nig\u2019s description of Stephanie\u2019s performance with its focus on the wide-\nopen mouth is most likely deliberately evocative of Lessing\u2019s Laokoon essay, which not\nonly contains an extensive discussion of disgust but which after all proceeds from a\ncontemplation of how Laokoon\u2019s mouth is represented in the ancient Greek statue (see\nFig. 2).31 By way of looking at this statue Lessing discusses the limits of the visual arts\n(Lessing calls these \u2018painting\u2019), which are the medium for the representation of bodies\nju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy 27\nin space. Because they affect the imagination differently from linguistic representation\n(which Lessing calls \u2018poetry\u2019), the medium proper for the representation of bodies in\ntime, the visual arts have to be more restrained and adhere to the laws of beauty. Thus,\nwhile Virgil in his poetry can sing of Laokoon\u2019s \u2018terrible screaming\u2019, the sculptor does\nnot permit Laokoon\u2019s face to show the real intensity of his pain with a mouth wide open.\nThe Greeks, Lessing determines, had wisely decided that the visual arts had to be limited\nto the representation of beautiful bodies. As Susan Gustafson analyses, \u2018Lessing attempts\nto locate in the Laokoon essay a classical corporeal ideal. The body sought, like that\nviewed in Lacan\u2019s mirror stage, should evince the sense of a cohesive, structured, namely,\nSymbolic imago.\u201932 In turn this imago or \u2018ideal-I\u2019 allows the viewer to (mis)recognize his\nown cohesion in narcissistic identification.\nBy extension, these rules are also true for the art of acting and explain Lessing\u2019s\nlonging for the actor\u2019s \u2018corporeal eloquence\u2019. The art of acting, as Lessing reiterates in\nthe Hamburgische Dramaturgie, is situated in between the visual arts and poetry, it is\nboth \u2018transitory painting\u2019 and \u2018silent poetry\u2019.33 But because performance like painting is\ndirectly and immediately intuitable through the senses, live drama has to adhere more\nclosely to the rules laid down for the visual arts:\nThe reporting of someone\u2019s scream produces one impression and the scream itself\nanother. The drama, designed for living representation by the actor, might perhaps for\nthat very reason have to conform more strictly to material representation in painting. In\nit we do not merely believe that we see and hear a screaming Philoctetes, we do actually\nsee and hear him. The closer the actor approaches nature, or reality, the more our eyes\nand ears must be offended; for it is an incontrovertible fact that they are offended in\nnature itself when we perceive loud and violent expressions of pain.34\nAnd the aggressive offence (German \u2018Beleidigung\u2019) of eyes and ears is a strict impediment\nto the imagination\u2019s sympathy or pity (\u2018Mitleid\u2019) with the represented body. Only its\nbeauty can bring about \u2018Mitleid\u2019 because the latter necessarily has to be coupled with\naesthetic pleasure.\nLessing proves this by way of a mental experiment, which turns the Laokoon statue\ninto a virtual performer:\nSimply imagine Laokoon\u2019s mouth forced wide open, and then judge! Imagine him\nscreaming, and then look! From a form which inspired pity because it possessed beauty\nand pain at the same time, it has now become an ugly, repulsive figure from which we\ngladly turn away. For the sight of pain provokes distress; however, the distress should\nbe transformed, through beauty, into the tender feelings of pity.35\nAs Gustafson\u2019s analysis of this passage shows, what is precluding the viewer from\nsympathetic identification is the intrusion of what Kristeva has termed the \u2018Semiotic\u2019,\nnamely everything which escapes meaning and symbolization and evokes the messy,\nundifferentiated energies of the body:\nLessing here outlines in nuce the essential foundations of his theory of sympathy\n(subject) formation . . . He envisions the Symbolic function of the law of beauty in the\n28 ju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy\nsublimation of the Semiotic-corporeal pain, in the silencing of the Semiotic scream.\nSympathy (subject) formation requires a tempering of the Semiotic (body) by means\nof the Symbolic (law).36\nAs both Gustafson and von Mu\u00a8cke show in their respective work, the evocation of\nSemiotic corporeal content in the work of art \u2013 the evocation of the maternal, of\nhorror, imperfection, ugliness, pain, or death \u2013 is a necessary part of subject formation.\n\u2018Abjection\u2019, Kristeva says:\nis a precondition of narcissism. It is coexistent with it and causes it to be permanently\nbrittle. The more or less beautiful image in which I behold or recognize myself rests\nupon an abjection that sunders it as soon as repression, the constant watchman, is\nrelaxed.37\nBecause of this fragility of narcissistic identifications the representation of Semiotic\ncontent has to be carefully managed in such a way that the imagination can deal with\nit \u2013 either by mixing it with beauty, by a move from image to text (e.g. by describing\nLaokoon\u2019s pain instead of showing it), or by subduing it in the visual representation (e.g.\nby showing the pain in Laokoon\u2019s muscles but not in his face in order to balance beauty\nand ugliness). In the case of the \u2018thoroughly abject\u2019, however, this is not possible: the\nhorrible or the disgusting (\u2018das Abscheuliche oder das Ekelhafte\u2019) or outright screaming\ncauses a collapse of the difference between nature and imitation and leads to the real\nsensation of repulsion and a refusal to identify.38 The \u2018thoroughly abject\u2019 therefore has\nto be banished from representation altogether.\nLet me return now to our disgusting actor in Vienna\u2019s Emilia Galotti \u2013 that\n\u2018horrible\/revolting fellow, that Stephanie!\u2019 (\u2018der abscheuliche Kerl, der Stephanie!\u2019), as\nLessing calls him in his reply to Eva Ko\u00a8nig.39 Although Stephanie is not screaming, his\nwide-open mouth in its visual, graphic effect would be offensive in itself. For, as Lessing\nexplains in the Laokoon:\nThe wide-open mouth, aside from the fact that the rest of the face is thereby twisted\nand distorted in an unnatural and loathsome manner, becomes in painting a mere spot\nand in sculpture a cavity, with most repulsive effect.40\nIn the live actor the gaping mouth would be even more disturbing as it reveals a visceral\ninner reality that the outer gestalt of the actor should hide: saliva, the tongue, the abyss\nof the throat. Add to this the sight of blood which, as Lessing explains in the context\nof a different play in the Dramaturgie, must not be shown on stage: \u2018Pantomime must\nnever be pushed to the disgusting. It is good when in such cases the heated imagination\nbelieves to be seeing blood but the eyes must not really see it.\u201941\nIn order to understand the enormity of the actor\u2019s insult to Lessing\u2019s aesthetics,\nhowever, we have to look at the dramatic context in which Stephanie\u2019s gestural and\nfacial \u2018ad-libbing\u2019 takes place. Emilia Galotti, we remember, is the story of a bourgeois\ndaughter who opts for a sacrificial death at the hand of her father rather than allow\nherself to be seduced by the prince who abducted her. Gustafson\u2019s reading in her book,\nAbsent Mothers and Orphaned Fathers, suggests that Emilia Galotti is about the abjection\nju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy 29\nof the maternal Semiotic realm and the reaffirmation of the paternal Symbolic realm.\nIt is Emilia\u2019s mother, Claudia, who is responsible for Emilia\u2019s absence from the father,\nfor introducing her into urban society and houses of pleasure, and for commissioning\nthe portrait of Emilia which falls into the wrong hands and allows the prince to lay\neyes on her. The play works, as Gustafson analyses in detail, to separate Emilia\u2019s and the\nfather\u2019s self from everything associated here with the maternal body: desire, laughter,\ncharacters like the Countess Orsina who represents a massive \u2018bacchanalian feminine\nthreat\u2019 to the patriarchal-Symbolic order42 and an unarticulated screaming and verbal\nerosion that infects all characters in the play. The play\u2019s solution to escape this Semiotic\nchaos is \u2018to abject the daughter, to articulate with a knife the difference between self\n(father) and (m)other and to thus reaffirm the paternal fantasy of a virtuous daughter\nand self-purity\u2019.43\nStephanie\u2019s obscene gesture thus occurs at the very moment in the performance\nwhen the play has managed an ever-so fragile return to the Symbolic. Stephanie as\nthe prince reverses the father\u2019s victory and metaphorically enacts the \u2018consumption\u2019 of\nEmilia which her death as an \u2018intact\u2019 virgin body was meant to deny him (she died, in\nEmilia\u2019s last words, as \u2018a rose broken before the storm could defoliate it\u2019).44 His action\nof licking the blood off the dagger that just killed Emilia crudely reinvokes the whole\nSemiotic\/maternal content that had just been abjected with great effort. Emilia\u2019s \u2018warm\nblood\u2019, as Gustafson argues with Kristeva, not only \u2018represents internal desire\u2019 (Emilia\u2019s\nand by displacement her father\u2019s) but also marks her as a nascent wife and relates her to\nthe contaminating maternal realm:\nBlood is specifically that impure feminine element \u2013 menses \u2013 that is always excluded\nfrom the temple. Menstrual blood represents the \u2018frailty of the symbolic order\u2019. It evokes\nthe \u2018fear of the archaic mother\u2019 . . . Emilia\u2019s menses constitutes the most abject element\nin the play.45\nAnd it is this abject element which Stephanie\u2019s performance brings to the fore again. In\nthe form of her blood on the dagger Emilia\u2019s desire and contamination live on.\nIronically, Stephanie in this way articulates what Gustafson would see as the\nultimate truth of the play, namely that Emilia\u2019s sacrifice does not actually work to\nrepress the maternal\/Semiotic realm which returns to haunt and threaten the Symbolic.\nFinally, of course, Stephanie\u2019s uncalled for action completely detracts the spectator from\nthe sympathetic identification he is meant to undergo, namely that with the father.\nGustafson\u2019s conclusion that the Semiotic \u2018scream\/laugh pursues the paragons . . . of the\npatriarchal Symbolic order relentlessly\u201946 in the end might be especially true of the\nperformance dimension of the play.47 But this performance dimension, as I will argue\nby way of conclusion, is somewhat of a blindspot even in Gustafson\u2019s argument.\nCorporeal eloquence and gestural screaming: Lessing\u2019s abjection of performance\nWith respect to the relationship between text and performance, Gustafson maintains that\nLessing \u2018consistently concentrates on both in his Hamburgische Dramaturgie\u2019.48 In light\nof my analysis of the Dramaturgie, this statement would have to be heavily qualified:\n30 ju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy\nthe actual performance, as I have shown, constitutes a potential threat and reservoir\nfor disgust and disturbance of illusion \u2013 even physically driving Lessing out of the\ntheatre. As a discursive analogue to such physical repulsion, Lessing in the Hamburgische\nDramaturgie moves to a discussion of characters to legislate corporeal performance from\nafar, according to the laws laid down in the Laokoon. His move away from an analysis\nof actual performance, I would maintain, could itself be read as a \u2018strategy of abjection\u2019\nwhich silences the performing body and replaces it with virtual performances in the\nreader\u2019s mind.\nBy the end of the Dramaturgie, Lessing is \u2018weary of \u2019 or \u2018disgusted\u2019 with writing about\nperformances. Thus the Hamburgische Dramaturgie ends with a lament very similar to\nthe one that had once set Lessing on his reform course: \u2018We have actors but no art of\nacting. If such an art existed in former times we no longer have it; it has been lost; it\nhas to be re-invented from the beginning\u2019.49 Like the idea of a universal language, the\nidea of a universally communicable art of acting with \u2018specific rules, acknowledged by\neverybody and composed with clarity and precision\u2019, is nostalgically located in the past\nand at the same time projected into an indeterminate future.\nLaokoon\u2019s scream resurfaces in the Dramaturgie as the \u2018inarticulate screaming\u2019 of\nthe actors\u2019 gestures, which can never live up to the ideal of a transparent \u2018corporeal\neloquence\u2019. As in the Laokoon statue, the scream here \u2018represents emotion that has\nnot yet acquired (or lost) the meaning and syntax it obtains from the body\u2019.50 Rather\nthan support the dramatic text with eloquent \u2018silent play\u2019 so that it can attain perfectly\n\u2018natural\u2019 signification, the actors may entirely jeopardize the aesthetics of tragedy: As\nLessing complains, \u2018through their gestures they ruin everything. They know neither\nwhen they have to make any, nor which ones. They usually make too many and too\nunmeaningful ones\u2019.51\nThe power of the actor to evoke the realm of the Semiotic also has to do with the\ntemporality of performance. As the art of acting is located in between the visual arts and\npoetry, the performer\u2019s tempo, Lessing realizes, can decide whether the effect tends more\ntowards the \u2018graphic\u2019 effect of a painting or the successive effect of \u2018poetry\u2019:\nAs visible painting [the art of the actor] certainly has to have beauty as its highest law;\nbut as transitory painting it does not always have to give its postures that calmness\nwhich makes the ancient works of art so impressive. It may, it must at times allow itself\nthe wildness of a Tempesta, the insolence of a Bernini; in [the art of acting] this has all\nthe expressiveness that is peculiar to it without having the offensiveness that it obtains\nin the visual arts through the permanent posture. Only [acting] must not remain in it\nfor too long; only it must prepare it through the preceding movements and through\nthe following resolve it into the general tone of decency; only it must not give it all the\nstrength to which a poet can drive it in his treatment of it.52\nWhile Lessing clearly admires the way the actor can make paintings move, this passage\nwith its many qualifiers (\u2018only . . . only . . . only\u2019) clearly bears witness to the dramatist\u2019s\nanxiety about what the actor might do with the script. Unlike in the process of reading\nwhere the reader controls the speed of reading, in performance it is the performer who\ncontrols the speed of \u2018reception\u2019 and the duration of signs. As Lessing laments, the\nju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy 31\nplaywright does not have a system of notation for the timing of movement53 and is\nultimately at the mercy of the performer.\nFurthermore it is ultimately the live co-production of the performers and audience\nwho determine the process of reception and the meaning of a performed play,54 so it\ncomes as no surprise that the audience for Lessing is not to be trusted either:\nThe gallery is, of course, a great lover of everything noisy and raging, and they will\nrarely fail to respond to a good lung with loud hands. The German pit as well is still\npretty much of this taste, and there are actors who are clever enough to know how\nto take advantage of this taste. The most sleepy actor pulls himself together when he\nis meant to make his exit, suddenly raises his voice and overloads the action without\nconsidering whether the meaning of his speech really demands this heightened effort.\nOften enough it even contradicts the state in which he is meant to depart; but what is it\nto him? Enough that he has thus reminded the pit to notice him, and if it would please\nbe so good as to applaud him.55\nThe cardinal collective sin of audience and actor here is that they call attention to\nthe actor as an acting body and to themselves as bodies in the audience. Lessing\u2019s (as\nwell as Diderot\u2019s) dramaturgy, however, demands that the beholder and the actor, that\ntheatre itself can be forgotten \u2013 a forgetting that Lessing himself effects in the text of the\nHamburgische Dramaturgie by silencing the performing body.56 But will it keep quiet?\nPostscript\nSince 2001 the annual international summer theatre festival at the Kampnagel site in\nHamburg has been reinvented as the \u2018Laokoon Festival\u2019. With this title the organisers are\ndeliberately referring to Lessing\u2019s theoretical essay on the expressive powers and effects\nof different artistic media arguing that \u2018in an age when the theatre moves seemingly\nrandomly between the arts and helps itself now here now there, Lessing\u2019s Laokoon text\nraises questions that are highly topical for the development of contemporary theatre\u2019.57\nIn 2002, when the festival\u2019s theme was \u2018History and Memory in the Age of\nGlobalisation\u2019, its poster irreverently depicted the Laokoon statue on a paper plate with\nLaokoon and his sons being strangled by spaghetti instead of giant snakes (see Fig. 3).\nTo some commentators this signified the dangers of globalization. Thus Evelyn Finger\ncommented in Die Zeit :\nSpaghetti are the ties of the banal, they symbolize the ancient Greeks being threatened\nby the Italian kitchen or else the endangerment of cultural achievement through\nsatisfaction of the drives (vulgo: stuffing yourself), in any event an unstoppable\nmassification.58\nFinger went on to argue that the task of the Kampnagel festival programme was to develop\na \u2018counter programme to the noodle-fication\u2019, that is, the undifferentiated conformity of\nthe world. With this analysis of the festival poster, Die Zeit thus automatically reproduced\nthe gesture of \u2018abjection\u2019 that is embedded in Lessing\u2019s Laokoon treatise. Anything that\nthreatens the (classical, western) individual in his subject formation is to be fought off.\n32 ju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy\nFig. 3 Poster motif for the Kampnagel Summer Festival LAOKOON in 2002. (Reproduced from the title\npage of theHamburger Morgenpost festival supplement with kind permission by Kampnagel, Hamburg.)\nInstead one could suggest a more optimistic reading of the festival poster, which\ntakes account of its ironic, pastiche character. Laokoon \u2013 the statue as much as Lessing\u2019s\ntreatise \u2013 is here gleefully confronted with the messiness of the Kristevan Semiotic.\nBy being served up this image on a plate, the festival visitor is invited to indulge in\nju\u00a8rs-munby The Abjection of Performance in Lessing\u2019s Dramaturgy 33\nthe \u2018messy\u2019 pleasures of performance, which in this \u2018postdramatic\u2019 age has once again\nregained prominence and presence, having emancipated itself from the dominance of\nthe text and the pressures of mimetic representation.59 The poster could be seen to invite\na direct sensory engagement and possibly even \u2013 Brecht forbid! \u2013 a new kind of \u2018culinary\u2019\nattitude to the performances on offer. And just as Jatinder Verma states (with reference\nto the culinary revolution in Britain over the last thirty years) that \u2018the development\nof multiculturalism is being led by the stomach\u2019,60 the real-live meeting of spectators\nand performers in intercultural festivals like these, while always running the risk of\n\u2018orientalism\u2019, may ultimately invite the genuine encounter of difference and alterity and\neven hold out the challenge of \u2018embracing the other\u2019, which Verma identifies as the major\nchallenge of the twenty-first century.

Stu\u00a8ck, p. 354.\n56 There are also indications that Lessing was no longer willing to run the risk of performance with his\nlater plays. Victoria Pfeil\u2019s study of Lessing\u2019s stage directions cited earlier also found that his later plays\nshowed a drastic reduction in stage directions. See Pfeil, Lessing und die Schauspielkunst , p. 43.\nSignificantly Lessing\u2019s last play, Nathan the Wise, is called a \u2018dramatic poem\u2019. In light of the media\ndistinctions drawn in the Laokoon this would indicate that the ideal audience member for this play is\nmore of a reader\/listener than a spectator at a live performance.\n57 \u2018Warum Laokoon?\u2019, Laokoon festival supplement (in conjunction with Hamburger Morgenpost,\nHamburg, 21 August 2002), p. ii.\n58 Evelyn Finger, \u2018Spaghetti\u2019s erwu\u00a8rgen Laokoon\u2019 in Die Zeit , 36\/2000.
