Email: a.bryson@niesr.ac.uk \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn early 2007, Derek Blackadder, a Canadian labour activist, was banned from \nusing his Facebook account not once, but twice, for allegedly breaching Facebook\u2019s limit \non sending more than 1,000 messages at a time and for masking his organizational \naffiliation behind his individual profile on the site. Both \u2018rules\u2019 had been flouted before, \nwith many companies maintaining their own Facebook sites at the time of  Blackadder\u2019s \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 2 \nban. Given that the rules were subsequently relaxed, the question of why this particular \nbehaviour had drawn the attention of Facebook\u2019s administration when it did raised \nconcerns.  \nIt turns out that the ban coincided with a union organizing drive that Blackadder \nwas leading and the firm\u2019s complaints that workers were using company time to organize \nusing the social network. Blackadder was eventually reinstated following an on-line \nprotest organized by fellow union activist Eric Lee and followers of the LabourStart \nwebsite he co-founded. Yet despite the bad feelings that this episode produced amongst \nsome union activists, Blackadder has remained decidedly positive about the promise that \non-line social networks such as Facebook can bring to trade union members interested in \norganizing.1  \nDiscussion of the links between trade unions and the burgeoning growth of on-\nline technologies has, up to now, followed a well trodden path, not too dissimilar from \nthe debate surrounding the Blackadder case. In one corner are trade union advocates of \nweb-based social networking and internet labour organizing. These Web 2.0 adherents \nargue that the internet represents the future for a growing segment of workers who spend \nmore time on-line than anywhere else. Neglecting the internet, according to the pro-web \nadvocates, is one reason why union membership growth has stagnated and especially so \namongst young workers.  \nIn the opposite corner are the sceptics of internet-based organizing. They point to \nrecent cases of where the much touted revolution of user-generated web content and \nsocial networking has slammed the door shut on trade union activists. These critics are \nsupported by recent critiques of the internet\u2019s future by Zittrain and others,2 which warn \nLabor History \n 3 \nthat the openness and so-called \u2018generativity\u2019 of the web \u2013 i.e., the ability for users to \ncreate and innovate in ways that are unknown by the creators of the technologies \nthemselves -- is being severly constrained.  \nZiitrain in particular points to two disturbing trends. First, is the displacement of \nmalleable PCs with internet-centered products that are tethered and cannot be easily \nmodified by users (e..g, iPhones, Blackberry\u2019s).  Second are the new Web 2.0 platforms \n(e.g., Facebook, Google) that provide the appearance of generativity but which, unlike \nWeb 1.0, can be closely monitored and eliminated from a central source. The case of \nDerek Blackadder is just one obvious illustration of this potential \u2018lock-down\u2019.3 \nThe problem is that both the positive and negative camps essentially view the \ninternet as another medium or communication tool for trade union organising   But, there \nis another way in which the internet-union debate could be structured, and that is around \nthe attributes that have made the internet and on-line social networking, in particular, so \nhugely popular. In short, the question could be reframed around whether the attributes of \non-line social networling, rather than the technology, can be applied to union activities? \nWith over 130 million active members worldwide, Facebook is an excellent \nexample of one of the largest and fastest growing membership-based organizations in the \nworld, rivalling only major religions in scope and scale. More to the point, at the same \ntime that union membership has been falling, a new membership based institution has \nbeen able to add millions of members of all ages across the globe. How did this happen? \nAre the two events related in some way? And perhaps more importantly, can some of the \nfactors that have made internet-based social-networking so successful in attracting active \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 4 \nmembers be applied to the current union movement\u2019s need to expand its own \nmembership base?  \n It is our contention that trade unions -- especially those operating in Wagner-style \nsystems where membership is acquired by organizing individuals and individual \nworkplaces --  need to do a better job of invoking and selling the hard-to-observe aspects \nof union voice to both employers and employees if they are to achieve union membership \nrates comparable to their 1950s peaks.4 We argue that unions can learn how to market \nthese hard-to-observe benefits by studying and appropriating techniques from \ncontemporary membership-based institutions such as Facebook and other successful on-\nline networking communities. The paper derives certain insights from similar historical \nsocial trends and examines their link with union ascendancy and subsequent decline. This \nargument is distinct from current efforts by trade unions to use Facebook to reach current \nor potential members, and also dissimilar from efforts to devise on-line union rivals to \nFacebook.5 \n \nFrom Two to the Many Faces of Unionism \n \nWhat is meant by the oft used expression \u201cthe two faces of unionism\u201d? Borrowing \nheavily from Bruce Kaufman and Freeman and Medoff,6 the two faces refer to union rent \nseeking behaviour and union voice. The union wage premium and its correlates --in the \nform of improved working conditions and benefits -- constitute the rent seeking and \nmonetary advantages of union membership for workers. These same benefits, however, \nalso correspond to the costs of unionisation to the firm.7   \nLabor History \n 5 \nThe counterpoint to this rent seeking face is employee voice. The provision of an \ninstitutionalised mechanism by which labour and management can communicate and \nbargain without fear of major repercussions, is the second (not so) visible face of \nunionism. Voice -- defined here as formal two way communication between employees \nand employers -- can offer a number of benefits to a workplace.8  In the presence of \nvoice, employees are less likely to quit when work related problems arise; and managers \nare more likely to learn things about their own workplace that they may otherwise not \nhave known or, crucially, ever thought of asking. Voice can, in this instance, be of benefit \nto both parties, which is why it is typically viewed as the positive face of unionism.9 \nTo understand why unions -- in particular those in the US which are the focus of \nour analysis here -- have had such a hard time adding sufficient numbers to their \nmembership rolls, one must first recognize that there are other faces to unionism beyond \nthose listed above. These are aspects of unionism that in the parlance of consumer theory \nwould normally constitute product \u2018attributes\u2019 only fully observed after \u2018purchase.\u2019   \nThe notion of union membership as a multi-attribute good with a mix of \u2018search\u2019 \nand \u2018experience\u2019 characteristics captures this reality.10 Our characterization of union \nmembership as an experience good occurs in a context where the bulk of benefits that \naccrue to both workers and firms (such as greater tenure, more family friendly policies, \nand a safer workplace) are only accurately revealed after a union is in place.11 The fact \nthat the costs of unionization in the form of dues and wage premium are fully known up-\nfront makes union membership appear more like a search good. And indeed, if this were \nall that unionism had to offer, then any of the additional complexities brought on by \nexperiential learning would disappear.   \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 6 \nHowever, these easy-to-observe attributes do not represent the full extent of union \nbenefits, which are mostly hidden from simple search. This in turn creates risks for \nparties prior to adoption. Risky or unknown benefits prior to adoption create delay on the \npart of employees and opposition on the part of employers (which over the scale of a \nnormal lifetime can appear perpetual in many cases).  \nThere is also a well-established literature in cognitive psychology which details \nhow the anticipation of regret \u2013 brought about by uncertainty over an outcome-- is often \nthe source of procrastination and delayed action.12 In the context of union growth and \nrejuvenization, these insights explain why even willing employees may never join a \nunion (or actively organize) for reasons owing ultimately to the obstacles created by these \n\u2018hard-to-observe\u2019 benefits. Once deflated by these up-front risks, the experiential benefits \nof unionisation are often outweighed by the benefits of worker delay, costs of organizing \neffort or opposition from management. \nThese encumbrances, however, can be mitigated by the presence of an external \nrule, as exists when a government imposes a legislative \u2018standard\u2019 of some kind, For \nexample, in the absence of a common standard, the recent High Definition DVD battle  \nbetween Toshiba and Sony has prolonged the adoption and purchase of HD DVDs by \nconsumers.13 The labour market equivalent of this standard setting would be trade union \nrecognition at a national or industry level as exists in France, or statutory works council \nrules governing workplace relations as exist in much of continental Europe. \n \n \n \nLabor History \n 7 \nHistorical Precedents \nExample 1: 1940s Hollywood and the Mainstream Portrayal of Unions \n \nIf the discussion above still sounds a bit too abstract, perhaps a historical example can \nestablish the point more concretely. To do so, we need to cast our gaze back 70 years or \nso to a time when unionism was actually viewed as an important and relevant institution \nwithin the mainstream of American society. This was a time when the full assortment of \nboth easy and hard-to-observe union benefits seemed to be recognized by a large portion \nof American workers, and even, it seems, by some firms.  \nThis attitude is reflected in a number of the popular films of the day. Although \nthere is still controversy surrounding how much of the New Deal\u2019s principles actually \npermeated the films of the 1930s and 1940s and how reformist the Golden Age of \nHollywood truly was \u2013 with some like John Trumpbour14 maintaining that any \nprogressive tendencies were dwarfed by the individualist and capitalist values maintained \nby the major Studios \u2013 there is no denying that by historical standards, these films capture \nsome of the most overtly solidaristic values ever seen on US screens.15 \nOne film, in particular, highlights the level of New Deal optimism and multi-\ndimensional rationale for unionism present in America at the time. The film in question is \nThe Devil and Miss Jones, a social comedy which premiered in 1941 and with quite \nradical undertones by modern day standards.  \n The plot is deceptively simple. A cantankerous (and highly reclusive) tycoon \nnamed John P. Merrick (as portrayed by Charles Coburn) learns that agitators are trying \nto unionize the downtown department store that he owns. To thwart the organizing drive, \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 8 \nMerrick (whom no one but a handful of attendants has ever seen) goes undercover and \ntakes a menial job as a shoe clerk at his own New York department store. In the course of \ngoing undercover, however, he unexpectedly befriends fellow employee Mary Jones \n(played by Jean Arthur) and her recently fired friend Joe O'Brien (played by Robert \nCummings), a labor union organizer. Once Merrick himself is subjected to the \nhumiliating treatment afforded his employees by his very own managers, he starts to \nunderstand the origins of workplace unease. As things develop, it is Merrick who ends up \nspearheading the union drive and establishing a labour-management agreement that \npromotes the interests of his workers as much as those of himself as owner.    \n What is remarkable about the film from today\u2019s standpoint, however, is its \ndepiction of working life. In particular, the film highlights how common experiences, \nboth inside and outside the workplace, bind department store workers together and help \nto foster the preconditions for a successful organizing drive. One scene in particular \nhighlights this reality. It begins when the workers meet on the department store\u2019s rooftop \nto discuss what they can do to improve working conditions and also the strategies and \ntactics needed to set up the union. At this meeting, worried that they may be discovered, \nthey hatch a plan to meet on weekends on the Coney Island beach to solidify their plans. \nWe shall come back to this scene again, as it proves especially relevant when we describe \nthe social trends that seem to be working against unions in the US today, but which at the \ntime of the film, the 1940s, were in harmony with labour organizing and unionism. \n That the movie\u2019s theme, of a successful union organizing drive helping both \nlabour and management, was not considered so radical in its day is true for several \nreasons. America was about to enter a war and the home front demanded labour-\nLabor History \n 9 \nmanagement cooperation.  It was also a film that appeared after that decade long slump \u2013 \nthe Great Depression \u2013 that had shaken the foundations of unfettered market capitalism in \nthe US. The film also clearly followed on from the precepts of the New Deal. For these \nreasons and others like it, the film was actually quite universal in its appeal. And this is \nexactly the question of relevance for North American labour: what happened to that \nmainstream appeal, where did it go?  \n We do not need to be reminded of the perilous state of private sector trade union \nstrength in 21st century America. If a picture can tell a thousand words, this one needs \nvery little comment. Notwithstanding the individual successes of many unions and \nvictorious unionisation campaigns such as Justice for Janitors in California16 and the \norganizing of nearly all the construction service\/hospitality sector in Las Vegas by the \nService Employees International Union (SEIU), the American union movement has been \nunable to reverse a trend that began in the late 1950s. There are now fewer than ten \nworkers out of one-hundred who are organized in the United States, down from more \nthan 30 during unionization\u2019s peak in the early-to-mid 1950s. \n There are many reasons for this decline, well known to many reading this article, \nbut we prefer to cast our torch on a somewhat less quantifiable cause. If we consider \nanother picture, this time of one that is embossed on our collective conscious, we may \ncome to a better understanding of the social forces at work that may have shaped the fall. \nThe picture in question is of a beach scene with what seems like thousands if not \nhundreds of thousands of bathers literally occupying every inch of sand.  The picture was \ntaken by the American photographer Weegee in the late 1940s on Coney Island.  There is \nan insight in that picture of relevance to unions, and it is the idea that more people did the \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 10 \nsame things back in 1948 than they do in 2008. Slightly more people live in New York \ntoday than did 60 years ago,17 yet fewer of them end up doing the same thing by going to \nthe local beaches on a summer weekend. Of the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers \nwho still head to beaches on summer weekends, many scatter to the Hamptons and the \ndistant zones of the Jersey Shore. Why is this so? \n \nExample 2: The Rise and Fall of Public Swimming Pools in the US \n \n A similar social trend has been discerned in a recent book that examines the life \nand times of -- of all things -- the Public Pool in America. In the book, Contested Waters: \nA Social History of Swimming Pools in America, Jeff Wiltse traces the evolution of \nmunicipal pools in America from the late 1860s to today.  Focusing on northern cities \nlike Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Louis, Wiltse finds that pools gradually became \nhotbeds of social interaction and social change.  In his words: \u201cMunicipal swimming \npools were extraordinarily popular during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s\u2026.Cities \nthroughout the country built thousands of pools\u2014many of them larger than football \nfields\u2014and adorned them with sand beaches, concrete decks, and grassy lawns.  Tens of \nmillions of Americans flocked to these public resorts to swim, sunbathe, and socialize\u2026 \nIn 1933 an extensive survey of Americans' leisure-time activities conducted by the \nNational Recreation Association found that as many people swam frequently as went to \nthe movies frequently\u201d18. \n Otherwise stated, public swimming was as much a part of America as was going \nto the movies. From the 1920s to the 1950s, municipal pools served as centers for the \nLabor History \n 11 \ncommunity and arenas for public discourse. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of \npeople gathered at these public spaces where the contact was sustained and interactive.  \nIn short, community life was fostered at municipal pools.  The history of swimming pools \nreveals changes in the quality of social life and the extent of civic engagement in modern \nAmerica.  \n So why did this principal social activity in America largely disappear? The \nproliferation of private swimming pools after the mid-1950s, according to Wiltse, caused \na retreat from public life.  Millions of Americans abandoned public pools perhaps \nbecause they, in actuality, preferred to pursue their recreational activities within smaller \nand more socially selective communities. Instead of swimming and interacting with a \ndiverse group of people at municipal pools, private-pool owners secluded themselves into \ntheir own backyards. \u201cThe consequences have been\u201d, according to Wiltse, \u201catomized \nrecreation and diminished public discourse\u201d.19 \n \nUnionism and the Facebook Society \n \nTwo related questions arise from this discussion and our two historical examples. First, \ndid rising incomes simply reveal the true private preferences of Americans?  Or, did \npublic pools offer people an opportunity for social and community interactions, which if \nreconsidered from a contemporary perspective, would produce different results today \nversus the 1960s when the switch to the private realm occurred?  Alternatively, were the \ncommunal activities fostered by the public pool system in America up to the early 1950s \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 12 \nsimply the result of being less materially well off, or did they in fact reveal a sense of \ncommunity that Americans regret having lost? \n Whatever the answer, it is no mere coincidence that the period of union \nascendancy in America coincided with these other mass social trends. Indeed even the \nadvent of Television offers a similar example.  For example, nearly one out of two \nAmericans watched the first episode of The Honeymooners in 1955. A show, it should be \nnoted, that depicted the life and times of a lower middle-class (and presumably \nunionised) New York bus driver portrayed by that every-man actor Jackie Gleason. \nToday half of all Americans cannot be counted on to vote let alone watch a single \ntelevision program en masse \u2013 not even the Super Bowl commands a fifty percent share \nof the viewing audience today. Yet, there are more television viewers in 2008 than ever \nbefore, but fewer viewers watching any single program. Much like Weegee\u2019s Coney \nIsland photo of weekend bathers, Americans have splintered and fragmented into \nmultiple demographic groupings and \u201csocial tribes\u201d.  \nHas anything replaced these \u2018common\u2019 activities, and if so what is it? It may \nsound axiomatic, but balkanized consumer choices are partly to blame for the loss of \ncommon cultural activities. Many social historians argue that private (household) \nconsumption and commercialism became the dominant cultural ethos in late twentieth-\ncentury America, effectively wiping out all competing public cultures.20 These critics \ncharacterize Americans as passive receivers of this consumer culture created and \npopularized by marketers, movie producers, merchants, and entrepreneurs. \n Another argument with a strong family resemblance to this line of reasoning is the \nidea popularised a decade ago by Robert Putnam in his book Bowling Alone The Collapse \nLabor History \n 13 \nand Revival of American Community. But whereas Putnam identifies Television as the \nprincipal source of decline in shared common experiences and social capital, we have just \nnoted that even at the level of Television program viewing \u2013 America is doing less in \ncommon today than in the 1950s.  \n A similar concern has also been echoed about Television\u2019s successor technology, \nthe internet.21 In Republic.com, Cass Sunstein argues that while democratic engagement \ndepends on shared experiences and requires citizens to be exposed to topics and ideas that \nthey would not have otherwise chosen, the Web affords individuals an unprecedented \nability to filter out everything that they do not wish to see, hear, or read. With the advent \nof tailored web platforms that learn more and more about their users, individuals begin to \nsee a narrower scope of daily life.  For example, users of Google begin to see only the \nsports highlights that they previously watched the evening before, read only about the \nissues that interested them the last time they logged on to the computer, and ultimately \nbegin to encounter only opinions which they agree with.  \nThe remarkable ascendance of the Internet and its wealth of personalized (as \nopposed to shared) experiences, raises questions, according to Sunstein, about how likely \nthis is to lead to a more active citizenship. In his words, the difference between the \nnewspapers and broadcasters of old, is that despite their static qualities, they nevertheless \n\u201chelped create a shared culture\u201d and \u201cas their role diminishes and the customization of \nour communications universe increases, society is in danger of fragmenting, shared \ncommunities in danger of dissolving...[and] in their place will arise only louder and ever \nmore extreme echoes of our own voices, our own opinions\u201d.22 \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 14 \nSo the same troubling questions persist: How accurate are these latter-day \ncharacterizations of American society?23 Can they really account for the decline in US \nunion membership, much as they explain the fall off in other mass behaviours such as \nmovie watching, public swimming, television watching and recreational bowling? \n This is where the second part of our title contains a potential answer to these \nquestions.  Facebook is a social networking website that initially allowed people to \ncommunicate with their friends and exchange information. Once you become a member \nof Facebook, you can select to join one or more participating networks, such as an old \nhigh school, place of employment, or geographic region. It was launched in 2004 (two \nyears after Sunstein\u2019s warnings of a Balkanized internet devoid of common experience) \nand founded by Mark Zuckerberg, a former Harvard student. Initially the membership \nwas restricted to Harvard students but was subsequently expanded to other Boston area \nschools and the Ivy League schools within two months.  Many individual universities \nwere added in rapid succession over the next year. Eventually, people with any email \nfrom across the globe were eligible to join.  Networks were then initiated for some large \ncompanies. As of October 2008, the website had the largest number of registered users of \nany social networking site, with over 130 million active members worldwide expected to \npass 140 million users by the end of the year (most now coming from non-collegiate and \ninternational networks). In just one year, between 2006 and 2007, it increased its ranking \nfrom the 60th to the 7th most visited web site (it presently stands at 5th). It was also the \nnumber one site for uploading photos in the United States, ahead of public sites such as \nFlickr, with over 14.5 million photos uploaded daily. All this sounds rather impressive, \nand it is. \nLabor History \n 15 \n But it is not unprecedented. There have been similar instances of when millions of \npeople have joined a social network in a relatively short period of time. Indeed, there is \none clear historical precedent. If one ventures back to 1930s America, it is the growth in \nunion membership between 1936 and 1946 that clearly stands out and had a similar \ndiffusion curve to that of Facebook. What is it about Facebook that in an era of \ncompeting claims on time and interest grows and disperses itself within a population \npurported to do nothing in \u2018unison\u2019 anymore? \n For one thing, contrary to generic criticisms of the consumer society, Facebook \nand other social networking sites are not passive forms of consumption.  In fact, they are \nactive in demanding production and attention from their members. Since the introduction \nof a free Developers API (application programming interface) in August 2006 and then a \nFacebook programming language in 2007, the platform has enabled users with \nprogramming skills to create their own applications. In less than a year, 33,000 \napplications have been generated by users. This is in part why Time Magazine in late \n2006 chose its Person of the Year as being \u201cYOU,\u201d namely the users of the internet. This \nstands in marked contrast to its cover in 1982 where the Computer was chosen as Man of \nthe Year and seated next to the computer was an anonymous form representing a person \nwith few if any active attributes.   \n The world of information technology has quickly moved from the passive to the \nactive. Facebook is the 21st century equivalent of the public pool or 1940s Coney Island. \nUnion membership, during the high-water mark of its ascendancy in the 1940s and \n1950s, benefited from having these contemporaneous forms of common experience upon \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 16 \nwhich to piggy back. So what is preventing modern unionism from doing the same with \nFacebook\u2019s 130 plus million members?24 \n The problem is that we don\u2019t have a labour market equivalent yet to the facebook \nsociety \u2013 as we did when the union movement was closely aligned with the social trends \nof the day and each reinforced each other (e.g., union sponsored bowling leagues).25 The \nday at the beach spent by the retail workers in the movie The Devil and Miss Jones \nreinforced their solidarity at the workplace. Can a similar model be adopted by North \nAmerican labour, something which facilitates the drive for voice and better working \nconditions at work? \n At this point it should be emphasised that this is not the same as arguing that \nunions have to set up their own Facebook pages for workers. Indeed even sophisticated \nadvertisers and companies have found these virtual social spaces hostile to on-line \ntargeting.26 Rather it is about appropriating the same attributes of the Facebook \nphenomenon and applying them to the \u2018proposition\u2019 that unions offer both workers and \n(crucially) to firms as well. In this regard there are five attributes in particular that unions \ncan appeal to.  \nFirst, Facebook is simple to use and cheap to acquire without being simplistic. \nGoogle is much like this as well. That is, you can go back to Google or Facebook and \nreceive different benefits each time without having to re-learn the architecture. Second, \nthere is a common platform that allows for constant evolution but also for tailoring by \nindividuals or groups. Third, low (to non-existent) entry costs exist for Facebook \nmembers. There is no real pecuniary penalty to leaving Facebook either, which means \nyou are more likely to try it for the first time. Fourth, \u2018use-as-you go\u2019 systems, like those \nLabor History \n 17 \nadopted by Facebook, are quite appealing to new adopters, unsure of the potential \nbenefits and with fears of lock-in. Finally, strong network externalities (so-called \nbandwagon effects) are a  part of Facebook\u2019s success, whereby the greater the installed \nbase of users, the greater are the individual benefits to existing members and new \nadopters looking to join the site.  \n This list of Facebook society attributes has, we believe, some transfer to the \nproblem of acquiring more trade union members than are lost to attrition. It has been \nfound in work on British union membership decline by that \u2018loss of membership\u2019 has \nremained constant for close to 30 years in Britain.27  During that time, however, union \ndensity reached a plateau and began its steady decline. How can this be? \n The overall cause of decline was the growth in \u2018never membership\u2019.28  That is, \npersons who entered the labor market post-1980 and who increasingly never had a \nunionized job. This is a self-reinforcing trend due to many of the reasons alluded to \nearlier in our depiction of union membership; in particular, the notion of unionism as \n\u201cexperience good\u201d. Unionism imparts a number of benefits that are often hard to observe \nfrom the outside and the way into membership often has to be learned.  Hence, whatever \nthe impulse (the poor labour market conditions of the early 1980s, the anti-union \nsentiment of workplaces set up after 1960s) for the initial rise in never membership, once \nthe trend started, the social propagation mechanisms began to work against union \nmembership growth. \n \n \n \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 18 \nConclusion  \n  \n There are major challenges facing Wagner-style unionism. This is true not only in \nthe US, but anywhere that unions have to organize a workplace and convince employees \nand firms of unionism\u2019s benefits.  It becomes difficult to add new members under \ntraditional approaches especially when there is a less supportive social environment that \ndoes not readily highlight the positive attributes of unions, especially the union voice \nattributes that are otherwise hard to observe in the absence of union contact and exposure.  \nThough we have offered a characterization of a modern social phenomenon that \nmay give unions some hope of attracting millions of new members, unfortunately, we do \nnot  know what a new model of unionism, which borrows from the success of Facebook-\nstyle social networks, would look like. But we do know that it would have to start looking \nquite different from the model on offer now, with its focus on stasis rather than growth.  \nThere is also a causal ordering problem at work here. Common choices made by a \nmass of workers require common experiences, which in turn, create common \nexpectations and tastes. Increased personalised internet use, tailored consumer choice and \nproduct differentiation strategies by firms work to balkanize consumer markets. \nBalkanized consumer markets mean that we are increasingly segmented in our activities \noutside the workplace. Discussions around the water cooler become increasingly more \ndifficult. \n And fragmented consumer choices have a more profound effect than merely \nraising the cost of explaining what you do outside of work to your colleagues. They also \nchange the nature of work as well. The more segmented we become as consumers and \nLabor History \n 19 \ncitizens outside of work, the more our work loses commonality. There were once armies \nof typists and ditch diggers all doing basically the same thing. Today, however, it \nbecomes increasingly hard to find two people doing the same thing inside the workplace, \neven for workers with the same job titles. Work processes have become as specialised as \nthe products and services employees are obliged to provide. So segmented leisure, \nconsumption and working experiences no longer lend themselves to the \u2018communal \nsolutions\u2019 provided by Wagner-style collective bargaining models.  Indeed, if one looks \nat the professions in the US that have actually held their own and even added union \nmembers over the past 20 years (e.g., pilots; flight attendants; machinists; teachers; actors \nand screenwriters; journalists; and nurses) these have been professions in which \u2018output\u2019 \nhas remained fairly standard and changed much less over time than for an IT worker, \ncomputer engineer or business consultant. \n In this paper we do not end with an answer or with a ready made solution to the \nproblems faced by US trade unions. Some, such as Richard Freeman and Joel Rogers, \nhave already tried to imagine this landscape well before the advent of social networking \nsites such as Facebook, and their efforts can perhaps point the way forward.29 Instead we \nmerely indicate a direction where unions need to look in order to find a supportive social \nphenomenon upon which to latch onto and also learn from. If Facebook is the equivalent \nof the Coney Island weekend retreat, then unions need to learn about what brings \npotential members out to the 21st century beachfront. \nBryson,A, R.Gomez and P.Willman  \n \n 20 \nReferences \nBryson, Alex and Rafael Gomez. \u201cWhy Have Workers Stopped Joining Unions?\u201d British \nJournal of Industrial Relations,  Volume 43, no. 1 (March, 2005): 67-92.  \n \nBryson, A. and Gomez, R. \u201cBuying Into Union Membership\u201d, in Gospel, H. and Wood, \nS.

Thus, to the extent that this is an easy to observe characteristic for \npotential members, unions may be losing the one lure into membership that is search-based rather than \nhaving to be experienced. \n \n5Our argument is not meant to stand in opposition to the impressive efforts of on-line Labor \ngroups such as Working America <http:\/\/www.workingamerica.org>  one of the first and very effective \n\u2018virtual\u2019 union networking organizations in the US.

See, Diamond and Freeman, \u201cWill Unionism Prosper in Cyber-Space? The \nPromise of the Internet for Employee Organization\u201d; Freeman and Rogers, \u201cOpen Source Unionism: \nBeyond Exclusive Collective Bargaining\u201d; and Freeman,\u201cFrom the Webbs to the Web: The Contribution of \nthe Internet to Reviving Union Fortunes\u201d. \n \n6 See Kaufman, \u201cThe Two Faces of Unionism: Implications for Union Growth\u201d, 61-92; and \nFreeman and Medoff, What Do Unions Do? \n \n7 As with any theoretical characterization that aims at simplifying a complex reality, this is not \nquite the case. For employees, real benefits are net of subscriptions. For employers the real costs are net of \nvoice benefits plus the potential cost of voice. \n \n8 See Willman et al., \u201cThe Long Goodbye: new establishments and the fall of union voice in \nBritain\u201d, 1318-1321. \n \n9 For more on voice see Kaufman and Levine, \u201cAn Economic Analysis of Employee \nRepresentation\" who spell out a full list of \u2018voice benefits\u2019 in detail and also highlight why private sector \nfirms may under-supply voice. \n \n10 See Bryson and Gomez \u201cBuying Into Union Membership\u201d; and Gomez and Gunderson, \u201cThe \nExperience-Good Model of Union Membership.\u201d \n \n11 In David Knoke\u2019s Organizing for Collective Action: The Political Economies of Associations, \non the political economy of associations, the author  explicitly compares unions with other forms of \ncollective association. Although the idea of unions as an \u2018experience good\u2019 is never explicitly invoked, the \ncomparison embraces the experience of membership as well as the structure of organisation and processes. \n \n12 Knowles and Lynn, Resistance and Persuasion. \n \n13 It is expected now that Sony has won the next generation DVD standard battle, with its Blu-Ray \ntechnology, that faster diffusion of high-definition technology will ensue. \n \nLabor History \n 25 \n                                                                                                                                                 \n14 Trumpbour, Selling Hollywood to the World: U.S. and European Struggles for Mastery of the \nGlobal Film Industry, 1920-1950. \n \n15  May, The Big Tomorrow: Hollywood and the Politics of the American Way. \n \n16 Erickson et al., \"Justice for Janitors in Los Angeles: Lessons from Three Rounds of \nNegotiations\". \n \n17 New York City\u2019s population in the 1950 census was 7,891,957 compared to 8,008,278 in the \n2000 (the last official census). \n \n18 Wiltse, Contested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America , 25-26. \n \n19 These arguments are of course nothing new, in particular see \u201cThe Goldthorpe Affluent \nWorker\u201d studies of the 1960s < www.bola.biz\/motivation\/affluent.html>.. \n \n20 Cross, \u201cCrowds and Leisure: Thinking Comparatively Across the 20th Century.\u201d \n \n21 This, in turn, has created a recent spate of concern over increased societal loneliness as a result \nof the Internet\u2019s encroachment on social life. See Cacioppo and William\u2019s Loneliness; and Dumm\u2019s \nLoneliness as a Way of Life, both reviewed in the weekend edition of The Wall Street Journal (29-30 \nNovember 2008). \n \n22 Sunstein, Republic.com,ix-x. \n \n23 Any conjecture made about societal change risks the problem of misconstrued generalisations. \nThis problem has spawned something called Mass Observation which is a way of recording how society, in \nthis case British, has changed over time. See: http:\/\/www.massobs.org.uk\/index.htm \n \n24 The legitimacy of unions\u2019 is an argument that may also be at play here. This argument is central \nin Hannan and Freeman, \u201cThe Ecology of Organizational Mortality: American Labor Unions, 1836-1985\u201d -\n- a thesis on the ecology of unionism whereby selection rather than adaptation drives overall trends in \norganizational success. In the US, for example, the number of unions peaked before the number of \nmembers. \n \n25 The natural union parallel here is the Kerr and Siegal model of strike activity in tight \n\u2018occupational communities\u2019. It is well known in the sociology of work that for the development of an \noccupational sub-culture to occur, there needs to be intense interaction among workers both on and off the \njob. An excellent example of this can be found in Zimmer\u2019s work on female prison guards in the US.  \n \n26 Stross, \u201cBrands Struggle on Facebook\u201d, 11. \n \n27  See Bryson and Gomez, \u201cWhy Have Workers Stopped Joining Unions?\u201d, 67-72. \n \n28 Ibid.,75-85. \n \n29 See Freeman and Rogers, \u201cOpen Source Unionism: Beyond Exclusive Collective Bargaining,\u201d; \nDiamond and Freeman, \u201cWill Unionism Prosper in Cyber-Space?
