The liv-\ning world thus has a hierarchical organization as far as its composition and architecture\nare concerned (Harris, 1999). Causal interactions in biological systems, in contrast,\nmove both up and down these scales. On the level of the individual organism, mole-\ncules are synthesized in a spatiotemporal fashion as result of, and resulting in, changes\nin cell number and state, and organismal geometry and topology. On the level of the or-\nganism type, or species, boundary conditions and compositional details are propagated\nacross generations largely through the continuity of the genes. So while organisms are\nself-organizing systems, they are not entirely so. The multicomponent, multiscale, hy-\nbrid nature of living systems continues to provide novel challenges to theoretical and\nexperimental biology.\nOccupying an intermediate level of the organizational hierarchy, the cell provides\na focal plane from which one can scale upward and downward. Because the cell is\nalso the minimal unit of life, cooperation among such units is the driving principle\nof multicellular organization. The cell\u2019s central role was already recognized by those\nscientists who first came to understand that they constitute the bodies of all living\nthings. This conviction is encapsulated in a legendary phrase of Raspail: \u201cDonnez-\nmoi une v\u00e9sicule organique dou\u00e9e de vitalit\u00e9, et je vous rendrai le monde organis\u00e9\u201d1\n(Raspail, 1833).\nAlmost two centuries later Raspail\u2019s assertion remains a still-distant goal, appearing\nto confirm Kant\u2019s doubts that there would ever be a \u201cNewton of the grass blade\u201d (Kant,\n1 This phrase can be translated as: \u201cGive me an organic vesicle endowed with life and I will give you back\nthe whole of the organized world.\u201d\nxvii\nxviii Schnell et al.\n1790). Multicellular systems have proven to be very complex. Whether cells are mem-\nbers of a community or components of a tissue, they are interacting continuously with\none another and with their local environment. Cells live in an aqueous porous medium,\nwhere signaling molecules are subject to diffusion, transport and decay along the flow\npatterns generated by the movements of the cells and other structures. Cells undergo\nswitches in type and thus in biosynthetic capability and behavior. Experimental work\nover the past three decades has established connections among these phenomena, and\ntheir molecular underpinnings and correlates. Some progress has been made in un-\nderstanding multicellular developing systems at the theoretical level, that is, in the\nform of mathematical or computational models encompassing the dynamical behav-\nior of cells and molecules at realistic spatiotemporal scales. This approach, though\ncurrently less developed than the experimental ones, is nonetheless essential for an\nunderstanding of morphogenesis and cellular pattern formation. This volume provides\ndescriptions of recent research in this area using a wide range of systems and modeling\nstrategies.\nConstructing models is something of an art. Several models might be consistent\nwith the data at hand; they might even yield the same mathematical or computa-\ntional representation. The first role of a model is to test a verbal description aris-\ning from a biological hypothesis, using the language of mathematics which, unlike\nverbal reasoning, allows the outcome of complex nonlinear interactions to be pre-\ncisely computed. If the model produces the incorrect predictions, then the biological\nhypothesis is incorrect. At a minimum, modeling can refine intuition. But a rigor-\nously developed model coupled with experiments has the potential to accomplish far\nmore.\nThe most realistic models of multicellular systems require the use of subcellular\nmodels, which can take into account biochemical kinetics and cytoskeletal mechan-\nics. Such models are multiscale. When the subcellular and supercellular regimes are\ncoupled these models can be used to investigate the large-scale, often visible, patterns\nseen in tissues.\nWhether on one scale or many, then, modeling can serve two purposes. When\nthe significant details of a developmental process are known, a mathematical model\ncan be used as a surrogate for the living system, providing a way to carry out\nvirtual experiments. These have the potential advantage of being more compre-\nhensive and more rapidly performed than corresponding in vivo or in vitro tests.\nIn such cases the model can provide a proof-of-principle that the known com-\nponents are indeed sufficient to replicate important behaviors and that they in-\nteract as expected. Where important details of the developmental process are not\nknown, modeling can serve as a tool for testing hypotheses and generating pre-\ndictions. Increased understanding can arise from both approaches. Therefore we\nneed a suite of models, each designed to address specific questions (Schnell et al.,\n2007).\nIntroduction xix\nThe Volume\nThis volume arises from the Ninth Biocomplexity Workshop held at Lake Monroe,\nBloomington, Indiana in May 2006. This event was part of the Biocomplexity Insti-\ntute workshop series organized by the Biocomplexity Institute and Indiana University\nSchool of Informatics. Biocomplexity 9 was titled \u201cMultiscale modeling of multi-\ncellular systems: An interdisciplinary workshop.\u201d Participants discussed current and\nfuture theoretical and experimental problems in the study of multicellular systems.\nResearchers were brought together from many disciplines, including experimental and\ntheoretical developmental biology, applied mathematics, biophysics, engineering and\ncomputer science. In addition to containing contributions from most participants of\nBiocomplexity 9, the present volume has chapters contributed by several leaders in\nthe field who were not in attendance.\nWe have organized the volume by starting with the chapters dealing with general\nconcepts of pattern formation, a focus of much mathematical and theoretical biology\nover the last three decades (Chapters 1 and 2). Chapters 3\u20135 deal with the process of\ngastrulation, the period in embryogenesis during which cell patterns and morphologi-\ncal complexity are first established from relatively simple multicellular systems. After\ngastrulation in vertebrates, the mesoderm lying along the dorsal side of the embryo to\neither side of the notochord gives rise to the serially repeated somites. In Chapters 6\nand 7, the reader will find two contributions dealing with models of somitogenesis,\nan area that has experienced a productive confluence of theoretical and experimental\nwork. In the five chapters that follow (Chapters 8\u201312), the development of specific\nstructures and organs crucial to the formation of fully functional organisms, such as\nlungs, glands, limbs and teeth, are explored. This volume on theoretical approaches\nwould be incomplete without the introduction of new methodologies. Chapters 13\u201317\nillustrate important advances in theoretical approaches to develop more realistic mod-\nels of multicellular systems.\nIn the middle of the last century, Alan Turing showed, using a simple mathematical\nmodel, that a system of chemical reactions with stable spatially uniform dynamics in\nthe absence of diffusion, could be destabilized by diffusion so as to assume a stable\nspatially nonuniform configuration (Turing, 1952). The result was highly counterin-\ntuitive at the time, since diffusion generally evens out spatial heterogeneities. Turing\nsuggested that the chemical pattern set up by the instability could serve as a prepat-\ntern for a cellular response. The plausibility of Turing\u2019s \u201creaction\u2013diffusion\u201d model\nas a biological mechanism was reinforced when Gierer and Meinhardt presented a\nrealistic reaction\u2013diffusion system that undergoes the Turing instability and produces\na pattern. This system comprises a pair of reacting chemicals labeled activator and\ninhibitor (Gierer and Meinhard, 1972). The first activates the production of itself and\nthe second chemical; the inhibitor in turn inhibits the growth of the autocatalytic acti-\nvator. Pattern formation is possible if the activator in this system diffuses much more\nslowly than the inhibitor, and has a shorter half-life. This led to an important principle\nof pattern formation: activation at short range coupled with inhibition at long range.\nxx Schnell et al.\nThis principle has proved to have general utility in developing systems even when the\nmorphogenetic signals and means of their propagation are not literally soluble mole-\ncules and free diffusion. In Chapter 1, Hans Meinhardt shows in an elegant fashion\nhow simple activator\u2013inhibitor systems can produce cell patterns and morphogenetic\nchanges reminiscent of those observed in many areas of development and how evo-\nlution may have employed similar dynamics in different ways to generate different\nforms in different taxonomic groups.\nThe paper by David Umulis and coworkers (Chapter 2) shows that patterns can arise\nby different mechanisms. One of the major problems of pattern formation is discov-\nering the mechanisms of localized production and transport that generate positional\ninformation. During the last 30 years, molecular biologists have focused on study-\ning molecular components involved in signal transduction and gene expression in a\nnumber of model systems in developmental biology. Umulis et al. focus their atten-\ntion on two patterns in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo which have been studied\nextensively by molecular developmental biologists: these are the anterior\u2013posterior\nand dorsal\u2013ventral patterning of the embryo. They show how molecular components\nare integrated in networks, and how these networks transduce the inputs they receive\nand produce the desired patterns of gene expression. Umulis et al. discuss a number\nof different aspects of robustness in Drosophila embryonic patterning and show how\nthe models lead to new insights concerning scale-invariance in anterior\u2013posterior pat-\nterning, the role of network topology and signature in the switching network used for\ncontrol of the segment polarity genes, and the role of signaling via heterodimers in\ndorsal\u2013ventral patterning.\nThe stunning successes of molecular biology in recent decades have mainly pro-\nvided the ingredients for the complex mechanisms of morphogenesis. The challenge\nnow facing us is to understand how these entities integrate in the correct manner so\nthat the whole is greater than merely the sum of the parts. Biochemical dynamics and\ntissue mechanics must play key roles in this process. In Chapter 3, Lance Davidson\nshows that there is no single molecular mechanism that controls morphogenesis, but\nrather there is a collection of cellular processes that work together to generate the ar-\nchitecture and modulate the forces responsible for changes in tissue form. Davidson\nsummarizes the early development of the frog Xenopus laevis from a biomechanical\nperspective. He describes the cells, their behaviors and the unique microenvironments\nthey traverse during gastrulation, demonstrating the important role of tissue mechanics\nin development.\nManli Chuai and Cornelis Weijer discuss the current understanding of the mecha-\nnisms underlying the initial phases of gastrulation, in particular the formation of the\nchick primitive streak (Chapter 4). The genetic basis of anterior\u2013posterior axis de-\nvelopment, germ layer and streak formation has been studied extensively. However,\nbecause of the small size of the embryo at these stages, little attention has been paid\nto the cell movement patterns associated with gastrulation. Chuai and Weijer review\ncurrent experimental evidence of gastrulation movements and the possible cellular\nmechanisms underlying these processes. Cellular mechanisms involved in gastrulation\nIntroduction xxi\nmay include oriented cell division, cell\u2013cell intercalation, chemotactic cell movement\nin response to attractive and repulsive signals and a combination of chemotaxis and\n\u201ccontact following.\u201d Chuai and Weijer critically examine the experimental evidence\nin favor for and against these different mechanisms and outline open questions in gas-\ntrulation research. An important conclusion of their work is that mathematical models\nand computer simulations have a fundamental role to play in furthering our under-\nstanding of gastrulation, since many of the interactions between cell signaling and\nmovement are dynamic and nonlinear.\nIn Chapter 5, Timothy Newman explores a mechanism based on planar cell polarity\nto explain coordinated cell movement lateral to the primitive streak during its forma-\ntion. These complex cell movements were recently observed by the Weijer group (Cui\net al., 2005). Newman shows via computer simulations that planar cell polarity can\ngenerate large-scale cell movement resulting in two counter-rotating vortices, similar\nto those observed experimentally. The complexity of coordinated cell motion is mod-\neled with a new computational method for studying multicellular systems, known as\nthe Subcellular Element Model. This new methodology is a powerful tool for model-\ning intracellular mechanisms and adaptive cell shape changes. Newman also provides\na brief review of grid-free modeling approaches. In this volume, the readers will find\nother methods for modeling morphogenesis at the cell level, such as the Cellular\nPotts Model (Chapters 7 and 11), finite element methods (Chapter 11), agent-based\nmethods (Chapter 13) cellular automata (Chapter 14), and Monte Carlo simulations\n(Chapter 16). All these methods have helped us in understanding the important role of\nindividual cells and their interactions in modeling morphogenesis.\nIn vertebrate embryos, the anterior\u2013posterior axis segments into similar morpho-\nlogical units, known as somites, after the formation of the primitive streak. These\nsegments constitute a prepattern for the formation of the vertebrae, ribs and other as-\nsociated repetitive features of the body axis. The formation of the repeated somites is\none of the areas of developmental biology in which an interplay between experimental\nand theoretical investigations has met with great success. The idea that temporal os-\ncillations may underlie the spatial periodicity of somite organization was anticipated\nby the evolutionary morphologist William Bateson in the late 19th century (Bateson,\n1894), first made part of a specific model by the experimentalist Jonathan Cooke and\nthe mathematician Christopher Zeeman more than 80 years later (Cooke and Zee-\nman, 1976) and confirmed experimentally by the group led by Olivier Pourqui\u00e9 two\ndecades after that (Palmeirim et al., 1997). In Chapter 6, Baker et al. review and\ndiscuss a series of mathematical models motivated by newer experimental findings\nwhich account for different stages for somite formation. These models range from\nthe creation of a genetic prepattern to the mechanisms involved in generating mor-\nphological somites. In his contribution, mentioned above, Hans Meinhardt proposes\na reaction\u2013diffusion model for somite formation. The paper by Baker et al. shows\nthat the segmentation pattern can also arise from other mechanisms. As noted previ-\nously, this is a commonplace of mathematical biology\u2014several models can produce\nthe same results and make similar predictions. The challenge for theoreticians is to\nxxii Schnell et al.\nsuggest carefully designed experiments to distinguish between models, and the chal-\nlenge for the experimentalists is to design ways of doing these experiments, which\nmay help decide between alternative mechanisms.\nIn Chapter 7, James Glazier and coworkers propose a model accounting for how cell\ndetermination and subsequent differentiation may translate into somite morphology.\nThe model starts from an established prepattern of adhesive and repulsive molecules,\nwhich gives rise to the patterns of cell movement and morphological changes leading\nto segmentation. The simulations of Glazier et al. are implemented using the extended\nCellular Potts Model. In this model cells are extended domains of pixels on a lattice.\nCell interactions are described by an effective energy and fields of local concentrations\nof chemicals. The effective energy combines true energies, like cell\u2013cell adhesion, and\nterms that mimic energies, e.g., the response of a cell to a chemotactic gradient.\nThe chapter by Sharon Lubkin (Chapter 8) describes the physical forces respon-\nsible for the morphogenesis of branched ducts such as those found in glands and in\nthe lung. Developmental biologists have experimentally uncovered a great deal of in-\nformation concerning the genes and signaling pathways of branching morphogenesis.\nLubkin illustrates how development must also take into account the physical aspects of\nchange in tissue shape and form. Indeed, physics can be seen as the primary means by\nwhich alterations in molecular expression bring about such tissue changes (Forgacs\nand Newman, 2005). In her contribution, Lubkin reviews a collection of relatively\nsimply and physically justifiable models for branching morphogenesis. The models\npresented have potentially measurable parameters which can be used to quantify the\nrelative contributions of different mechanisms to morphogenesis. A challenge for ex-\nperimentalists is to develop contexts and methods within which these novel models\ncan be tested.\nIn Chapter 9, Andras Czirok and coworkers review the patterning of the primary\nvascular plexus of warm blooded vertebrates. This is a process operating on vari-\nous length scales. They show that the formation and rapid expansion of multicellular\nsprouts is a key mechanism by which endothelial cell clusters join to form an in-\nterconnected network. The work of Czirok et al. employs sophisticated microscopic\nmethods to track cells and extracellular matrix fibers over an extended area of tissue.\nOn the basis of these experimental observations, they propose a mathematical model\nof preferential attraction to elongated structures that can explain multicellular sprout-\ning during vasculogenesis. This paper is another example of the benefits of theoretical\nframeworks for the comprehension of complex experimental results and in vivo reality.\nTakashi Miura shows how mathematical models can help us understand the mech-\nanism of branching morphogenesis, with emphasis on the lung (Chapter 10). With\nclose attention to experimental findings, including those from his own laboratory, he\nreviews several models which make predictions concerning the in vitro systems. One\nof these models generates tree-like branching patterns by applying a set of simple\nrules iteratively. Models have been useful for understanding some aspects of branch-\ning morphogenesis, and they can be helpful for understanding the functional aspects\nof the bronchial tree. Miura explains how simple multiscale models can help in under-\nIntroduction xxiii\nstanding both morphological and functional aspects of the bronchial tree. In addition,\nhe shows how mathematical models can help developmental biologists with little ex-\nperience in modeling gain new insights into the dynamics of pattern formation.\nThe development of the vertebrate limb has similarities to body axis segmentation\nin that a series of repetitive elements are formed, but also resembles branching mor-\nphogenesis in that more than one spatial dimension is needed to formally characterize\nthe pattern. It is an apt developmental system for mathematical and computational\nmodeling since it has been the subject of extensive experimental studies at the molec-\nular and cellular level. In Chapter 11, Stuart Newman and coworkers describe features\nof the developing limb itself, as well as a planar culture system that utilizes isolated\nmesenchymal cells of the embryonic limb to provide a simplified in vitro model for\nchondrogenic pattern formation. They present several different kinds of models for the\nvarious patterning processes, including a Turing-type continuum \u201creactor\u2013diffusion\u201d\nmodel that generates the well-known proximodistal order of appearance of skeletal\nelements, as well as a multiscale discrete stochastic model that reproduces several\nquantitative aspects of pattern formation in vitro. Since the full in vitro developmental\nprocess has both continuous and discrete aspects, they suggest that the most satisfac-\ntory model will have a hybrid nature.\nIn Chapter 12, Isaac Salazar-Ciudad reviews still another developmental system\nthat produces repeated elements\u2014the dentition, or teeth, of vertebrates. As the author\nshows, moreover, this system brings into focus an important but neglected question\nin developmental pattern formation\u2014the interplay between the released chemical sig-\nnals termed morphogens and changing tissue geometry. It is commonly assumed that\npattern formation proceeds in a \u201cmorphostatic\u201d fashion, i.e., by the generation of spa-\ntiotemporal patterns of morphogens, followed by shape-changing tissue responses to\nthese gradients. Salazar-Ciudad shows that this is not always the case: morphogen\npatterns can be dramatically affected when generated in concert with tissue rearrange-\nments in three-dimensional-space in the form of complex developmental mechanisms\nthat the author terms \u201cmorphodynamic.\u201d Using computational models he shows that\nmorphodynamic mechanisms can predict important topographic properties of tooth\ncusp formation. Equally important, such mechanisms must dictate more complex\ngenotype\u2013phenotype relationships over the course of evolution than simpler morpho-\nstatic mechanisms.\nThe chapter by Michael Meyer-Hermann (Chapter 13) starts with an overview of\nmathematical methods in biology to model multicellular systems, paying special atten-\ntion to the current agent-based methods, their strengths and limitations. By developing\na new agent-based method, he shows that the construction of a physically well-defined\nmodeling architecture for dynamic cellular systems is essential in order to gain pre-\ndictive power. Only when the parameters of the model are observable quantities does\nthe model acquire the potential to be falsified, which is a prerequisite of any scientific\napproach. The novel method developed by Meyer-Herman is an agent-based model\nfor cell mechanics based on geometrical representations known as Delaunay triangu-\nlations and Voronoi tessellations. The methodology combines physically realistic cell\nxxiv Schnell et al.\nmechanics with a reasonable computational load. He illustrates the power of the new\nmethod with two examples, avascular tumor growth and genesis of lymphoid tissue in\ncell-flow equilibrium.\nCells can be modeled as discrete entities distributed on a two-dimensional artificial\ngrid. This type of simulation is called a cellular automaton, completed by assigning\na set of rules governing the behavior of cells. In Chapter 14, Haralambos Hatzikirou\nand Andreas Deustch use cellular automata to understand the interplay of moving\ncells in the typical heterogeneous environment of multicellular systems. This is of\ngreat importance as cells move in a complex extracellular matrix composed of fibrillar\nstructures, collagen matrices and other cells, which can affect the cell response to ex-\nternal signals. They introduce a special subtype of automaton, known as a lattice-gas\ncellular automaton, which has been widely used as a discrete model of fluid dynamics\n(Wolf-Gladrow, 2000). The extension of this automaton for investigation of cell\u2013cell\ninteractions and cell\u2013environment interactions enables the observation of the macro-\nscopic evolution of the cell population and estimation of cell dispersion speed under\ndifferent environments.\nModeling approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Cellular automata are com-\nputationally efficient, and allow a wide range of cell behaviors to be implemented;\nhowever, they are also strictly defined on a grid, which may lead to artifacts, and do\nnot easily lend themselves to analytic calculation. In Chapter 15, Ramon Grima ad-\ndresses this and other issues. Multicellular systems are complex and can be studied at\ndifferent scales. Grima discusses how mathematical models can be constructed at dif-\nferent spatial scales so as to provide insight into the fundamental biological processes\ncentral to cellular pattern formation. He concludes that the simultaneous theoretical\nand numerical analysis of models of the same biological system at different spatial\nscales provides a better understanding than a single-scale model.\nIn Chapter 16, Elijah Flenner and coworkers use a combination of experiment, the-\nory and modeling to relate measured tissue-level biophysical quantities to subcellular\nparameters. Their work concentrates on the morphogenetic process of tissue frag-\nment fusion, a phenomenon seen in many episodes of organogenesis, by following\nthe coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The time evolution of this\nprocess can be described accurately by the theory of viscous liquids. They study fu-\nsion by Monte Carlo simulations and a Cellular Particle Dynamics model equivalent\nto the Subcellular Element Model described in T. Newman\u2019s chapter. The multidisci-\nplinary approach of combining experiment, theory and modeling provides a general\nand versatile way to study multiscale problems in living systems.\nNicola Bellomo and Guido Forni look at the problem of developing a general\nmathematical theory to model multicellular systems (Chapter 17). They use the math-\nematical kinetic theory for living particles to describe complex multicellular systems\ndealing with cell expansions, cell death and immune surveillance. Kinetic modeling\ndescribes the statistical evolution of large systems of interacting particles (e.g., cells)\nwhose microscopic state includes activity, a variable related to the expression of bi-\nological function. The modeling is developed at the cellular scale, as an intermediate\nIntroduction xxv\nbetween the subcellular and macroscopic scales. Bellomo and Forni apply their new\ntheory to investigate competition between neoplastic and immune cells. This work is\nimportant in that it illustrates that while theoreticians strive to include more realistic\nbiology in their models, they must also not fail to neglect the development of mathe-\nmatical theory to underpin and justify their modeling and computational approaches.\nThe contributions collected in this volume show how major questions in develop-\nmental systems can be addressed through a multidisciplinary effort, with particular\nfocus on the importance of mathematical and computational biology. The biology of\nmulticellular systems is now among the most active areas in all of science, relating\nnot only to embryonic development, the focus of most of these contributions, but also\nreparative medicine, cancer biology and immunology. The unprecedented growth of\nthese fields and the complexity of their experimental findings require new and innov-\native theoretical frameworks for their successful comprehension and application. This\nbook is intended to serve as a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in\nthe subject.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are very grateful to James A.
