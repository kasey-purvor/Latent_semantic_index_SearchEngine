In AF, relay sim-\nply amplifies and retransmits the received signal from the\nsource by relying only on the receive channel state informa-\ntion (CSI) available at the relay. In this paper we propose\ntwo novel power allocation methods for nonregenerative co-\noperative communication, assuming as in original AF that\nonly receive CSI is available at the relay. Both methods have\nbeen designed to maximize the mutual information of the re-\nlay link: the first method by using an analytical solution and\nthe second by solving a concave optimization problem. Per-\nformance of both our methods have been compared against\ntraditional AF power allocation techniques in a MIMO envi-\nronment, and results have demonstrated the efficiency of these\nmethods in terms of mutual information and bit-error rate.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nCooperative communication has recently attracted consider-\nable research interests [1\u20136]. In a simple cooperation sce-\nnario composed of a source (S) node, a single relay (R) node\nand a destination (D) node, three main links are established,\ni.e., S-D, S-R, and R-D links. Various approaches have been\nfollowed to design cooperative communication systems, the\nmost notorious ones are decode and forward (DF) and am-\nplify and forward (AF) [1\u20133,6]. DF is a regenerative approach\nwhere the full decoding of the source message followed by the\nforwarding of the whole message to the destination node via\nthe relay node are performed. On the contrary, AF is a simple\nnonregenerative approach where the relay node amplifies and\nforwards the received signal from the S node.\nIn cooperative multi-input multi-output (MIMO) scenario,\ninstead of using the relay like a simple equal gain (EG) am-\nplifier as it is done in the original AF scheme, it can be uti-\nlized as a smart precoder, which allows mutual information\nimprovement through efficient power allocation techniques\nbased on the level of CSI available at the R node. In the\nThis work has been performed in the framework of the FP7 project\nROCKET IST-215282 STP, which is funded by the European Community.\ncase that both the CSI of the S-R and R-D links are known\nat the R node, power allocation techniques have been recently\ndeveloped [7, 8] and they have shown to greatly enhance the\nperformance of AF in terms of mutual information. However,\nthese techniques required extra complexity since they rely not\nonly on S-R link CSI as in original AF, but as well as on R-D\nlink CSI, which may not always be available. Here, we also\naim at improving the performance of AF but without requir-\ning extra CSI knowledge, as in the AF matched filter based\nrelaying (MFR) and AF minimum mean square error filtering\n(MMSEF) techniques which have been lately proposed in [8].\nIn this paper, we design two novel power allocation meth-\nods for nonregenerative cooperative MIMO system, relying\non the system model introduced in Section 2. First, in Section\n3, we propose an analytical power allocation method based on\nthe maximization of the expectation of the relay link mutual\ninformation. Then, we introduce a novel power allocation al-\ngorithm based on the maximization of the relay link mutual\ninformation considering equal eigen mode (EEM). The first\nmethod provides close-to-optimum mutual information per-\nformance but with a high implementation complexity, whereas\nthe second method is low-complexity and still outperforms\ntraditional EG and other existing power allocation techniques\nsuch as MFR and MMSEF, both in terms of mutual informa-\ntion and bit-error rate (BER), as it is reported in Section 4.\nFinally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n2. CLASSIC COOPERATIVE MIMO\nCOMMUNICATION SYSTEM MODEL\nWe consider a classic cooperative MIMO communication sys-\ntem composed of three nodes, where a S node equipped with\nn antennas cooperates with a nonregenerative R node equipped\nwith q antennas to transmit data to a D node equipped with r\nantennas, as depicted in Fig. 1.\nFor the simplicity of the introduction, we assume a half\nduplex relaying scenario with two equal duration phases as\nin [7, 8], where in the first phase the BS broadcasts the sig-\nnal x to D and R, and in the second phase only R trans-\nmits to D. During the first phase, the signal x is received as\ny0 = H0x+n0 and y1 = H1x+n1 at the D and R, respec-\ntively, where H0 \u2208 Cr\u00d7n and H1 \u2208 Cq\u00d7n characterize the\n978-1-4244-3696-5\/09\/$25.00 \u00a9 2009 IEEE 524\nSx\nH1\nn1\nR\nG\nH2\nn2\nH0\ny1\nn0\ny2\ny0\ny\nD\nFig. 1. Nonregenerative cooperative MIMO communication\nsystem model.\nMIMO channel between the S-D and S-R links, correspond-\ningly. During the second phase, the signal y1 is modified\nby using the precoding matrix G \u2208 Rq\u00d7q, then is transmit-\nted towards D and is received as y2 = H2Gy1 + n2, where\nH2 \u2208 Cr\u00d7q characterizes the MIMO channel between the R-\nD link. Moreover n0 \u2208 Cr\u00d71, n1 \u2208 Cq\u00d71 and n2 \u2208 Cr\u00d71 are\nvectors of independent zero-mean complex Gaussian noise\nentries with a variance of \u03c32. The system model of the co-\noperative MIMO communication system introduced in Fig. 1\ncan be summarized as follows\ny =\n[ y0\ny2\n]\n=\n[\nH0\nH2GH1\n]\nx+\n[\nIr 0 0\n0 H2G Ir\n]\u23a1\u23a3 n0n1\nn2\n\u23a4\u23a6 , (1)\nwith Ir is a r\u00d7r identity matrix. Consequently, the aggregate\nmutual information of the cooperative communication system\nin Fig. 1 can be expressed as [9]\nI(y;x) =\n1\n2\nlog2\n\u2223\u2223I2r +HRxH\u2020R\u22121n \u2223\u2223 , (2)\nwhere\nH =\n[\nH0\nH2GH1\n]\n,Rn =\n[\nRn0 0\n0 H2GRn1G\n\u2020H\u20202 +Rn2\n]\n,\nH\u2020 denotes the conjugate transpose of H, Rx = E\n{\nxx\u2020\n}\nis\nthe transmit signal covariance matrix, Rn0 , Rn1 and Rn2 are\nnoise covariance matrices. Notice that the factor 1\/2 in (2)\naccounts for the 2-phases transmission.\nRecently in [7], the aggregate mutual information I(y;x)\nhas been shown to be bounded as I(y0;x) + I(y2;x) \u2265\nI(y;x) \u2265 I(y2;x), where I(y0;x) is the mutual informa-\ntion of the direct link and I(y2;x) is the mutual information\nof the relay link given by\nI(y0;x) =\n1\n2\nlog2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223I2kq +H0RxH\u20200R\u22121n0 \u2223\u2223\u2223 ,\nI(y2;x) =\n1\n2\nlog2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Rn2 +H2G(Rn1 +H1RxH\u20201)G\u2020H\u20202Rn2 +H2GRn1G\u2020H\u20202\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ,\n(3)\nrespectively. Hence, the aggregate mutual information I(y;x)\ncan be increased by maximizing I(y2;x) in (3), which means\nby optimizing G at the R node, when H0 is unknown.\n3. NOVEL RELAY RECEIVE KNOWLEDGE ONLY\nPOWER ALLOCATION METHODS\nHere, we first introduce in Section 3.1 the common methods\nto design the precoding matrix G when only S-R link CSI is\navailable at the R node. Then, we introduce our novel power\nallocation methods based on the maximization of I(y2;x) in\nSections 3.2 and 3.3. In the following, we assume Rn0 =\nRn2 = \u03c3\n2Ir and Rn1 = \u03c32Iq, with \u03c3 = 1.\n3.1. Traditional AF power allocation methods\nIn original AF, the precoding matrix G design follows an EG\napproach. In other words, G is designed such that the same\namount of power is transmitted on any of the available eigen\nmode of the R-D link, and such that the total transmit power\nof the R node, i.e., P2, respects the following constraint\nPR : E{\u2016G(H1x+ n1)\u20162F } \u2264 P2, (4)\nwhere E{.}is the expectation. Consequently, in the AF EG\napproach, G can be expressed as follows\nG =\n\u221a\nP2J\n(\nE\n{\u2016 J(H1x+ n1) \u20162F})\u2212 12 , (5)\nwith J = Iq. Lately in [8], other AF based approaches de-\nnoted MFR and MMSEF have also been proposed. They\nrely on the same G matrix formulation as in (5), but where\nJ = H\u20201 and J = (P1\/n)H\n\u2020\n1\n[\nIq + (P1\/n)H1H\n\u2020\n1\n]\u22121\n, re-\nspectively, and P1 is the total transmit power of the S node.\n3.2. Analytical power allocation method\nWe propose here a novel analytical power allocation method\nto optimize G based on the expectation of I(y2;x) over H2.\nIn the case that H1 is known at the R node, H1 can be de-\ncomposed via singular valued decomposition (SVD) as H1 =\nU1\u039b\u0302\n1\n2\n1 V\n\u2020\n1 where U1 \u2208 Cq\u00d7q and V1 \u2208 Cn\u00d7n are uni-\ntary matrices, and \u039b\u03021 is a q \u00d7 n rectangular diagonal matrix.\nMoreover, we consider that Rx = (P1\/n)In. Consequently,\nI(y2;x) in (3) can be re-expressed as I(y2;x) =\n1\n2\nlog2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223Ir +H2F\u02dcF\u02dc\u2020H\u20202\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2212 12 log2 \u2223\u2223\u2223Ir +H2G\u02dcG\u02dc\u2020H\u20202\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (6)\nwhere G\u02dc=GU1=diag(\n\u221a\np2,1,\n\u221a\np2,2, . . . ,\n\u221a\np2,q) is a q \u00d7 q\ndiagonal matrix and F\u02dc= G\u02dc (Iq + (P1\/n)\u039b1). Furthermore,\n\u039b1 = \u039b\u0302\n1\n2\n1 \u039b\u0302\n1\n2 \u2020\n1 is a q \u00d7 q diagonal matrix with diagonal ele-\nments \u03bb1,i \u2208 C, which are sorted in descending order. No-\ntice that \u03bb1,i \u0007= 0 for i \u2208 [1, L1] and that \u03bb1,i = 0 for\ni \u2208 [L1 + 1, q], with L1 = min{q, n}. Recently in [10],\nwe have shown that the expression E\n{\nlog2\n\u2223\u2223Ir +H\u0394H\u2020\u2223\u2223}H\nis asymptotically equivalent to\n\u03c7(\u03b4) =\n1\nln(2)\n[\nln\n(\nrr\n\u220fq\ni=1(d0\u03b4i + 1)\ndr0\n)\n\u2212\nq\u2211\ni=1\nd0\u03b4i\nd0\u03b4i + 1\n]\n(7)\n525\nfor any H \u2208 Cr\u00d7q and large values of r and q, where \u0394 =\ndiag(\u03b4) is a q \u00d7 q diagonal matrix, \u03b4 = {\u03b41, \u03b42, . . . , \u03b4q}, and\nd0 is the only nonnegative root of the polynomial given by\nP (d)=(d\u2212 r)\nq\u220f\ni=1\n(\n1\n\u03b4i\n+ d\n)\n+ d\nq\u2211\ni=1\nq\u220f\nj=1\nj \u0002=i\n(\n1\n\u03b4j\n+ d\n)\n. (8)\nNotice that (7) is similar to (19) in [10], for n = 1, m = q,\n\u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = r, \u03c9 = 1, and \u03c5i = 1\/\u03b4i in [10]. Then by solving\nthe following concave optimization problem\nmax\np2\n1\n2\n[\n\u03c7\n(\np2(Iq + (P1\/n)\u039b1)\n)\n\u2212 \u03c7(p2)\n]\ns.t. p2,i \u2265 0;PR :\nL1\u2211\ni=1\np2,i(1 + (P1\/n)\u03bb1,i) \u2264 P2,\n(9)\nwhere p2 = {p2,1, p2,2, . . . , p2,q}, we obtain the p2,i values\nthat maximize E{I(y2;x)}H2 . The following problem can-\nnot be easily solved by applying classic concave\/convex op-\ntimization tools [11]. However, it can be solved by using a\nrecursive function as follows\nFunction 1 Imax = recurs (i,p2,Imax)\n1: if i == L1 then\n2: p2,i = 0 for all i \u2208 [L1 + 1, q];\n3: Calculate \u03ba = 12 [\u03c7 (p2(Iq + (P1\/n)\u039b1))\u2212 \u03c7(p2)];\n4: if \u03ba > Imax then\n5: Imax = \u03ba;\n6: G = diag(\u221ap2,1,\u221ap2,2, . . . ,\u221ap2,q)U\u20201;\n7: end if\n8: else\n9: for s = 0 to S do\n10: p2,i = s(P2 \u2212\n\u2211i\u22121\nk=1 p2,k)\/[(S + 1)(1 +\n(P1\/n)\u03bb1,i)];\n11: Imax = recurs (i + 1,p2,Imax);\n12: end for\n13: end if\nIn the main algorithm, prior to use the function \u201crecurs\u201d, i\nand Imax must be set to one and zero, respectively. The com-\nplexity of such an algorithm increases with q and the number\nof sample S, which is used to adjust the accuracy of the algo-\nrithm. Hence, this algorithm can be difficult to implement for\nvery large q and S values, however it can be used as an up-\nper benchmark (UB) for AF mutual information performance.\nConsequently, we develop a lower-complexity power alloca-\ntion method, which is easy to implement, in the next section.\n3.3. Equal eigen mode power allocation method\nIn our EEM power allocation method, the G matrix is de-\nsigned to maximize I(y2;x) by assuming that all eigen mode\nof H2 are equivalent. This method is a cunningly modified\nversion of the methods propose in [7, 8] for the case where\nboth S-R and R-D CSI, i.e., full CSI (FCSI), is known at the\nR node.\nIn the case of FCSI at the R node, H1 and H2 are known,\nand H2 can be decomposed via SVD as H2 = U2\u039b\u0302\n1\n2\n2 V\n\u2020\n2,\nwhere U2 \u2208 Cr\u00d7r and V2 \u2208 Cq\u00d7q are unitary matrices,\n\u039b\u03022 \u2208 Cr\u00d7q is a rectangular diagonal matrices, and \u039b2 =\n\u039b\u0302\n1\n2\n2 \u039b\u0302\n1\n2 \u2020\n2 is a r \u00d7 r diagonal matrix with diagonal elements\n\u03bb2,i \u2208 C, which are sorted in descending order as in [7].\nNotice that \u03bb2,i \u0007= 0 for i \u2208 [1, L2] and that \u03bb2,i = 0 for\ni \u2208 [L2 + 1, r], with L2 = min{r, q}. Furthermore, G =\nV2G\u02dcU\n\u2020\n1, and consequently, we can re-express (3) after some\nsimplifications as\nI(y2;x) =\n1\n2\nL\u2211\ni=1\nlog2\n(\np2,i\u03bb2,i(1 + (P1\/n)\u03bb1,i)\n1 + p2,i\u03bb2,i\n)\n, (10)\nwhere L = min{L1, L2}. In order to obtain the p2,i values\nthat maximize (10), we must then solve the following concave\noptimization problem\nmax\np2\n1\n2\nL\u2211\ni=1\nlog2\n(\np2,i\u03bb2,i(1 + (P1\/n)\u03bb1,i)\n1 + p2,i\u03bb2,i\n)\ns.t. p2,i \u2265 0;PR :\nL\u2211\ni=1\np2,i(1 + (P1\/n)\u03bb1,i) \u2264 P2,\n(11)\nThe optimum solution is obtained by using Lagrange method,\n[11], as follows\np2,i=\n[\n\u2212(2 + p1,i\u03bb1,i) +\n\u221a\n4\u03bcp1,i\u03bb1,i\u03bb2,i + (p1,i\u03bb1,i)2\n2\u03bb2,i(1 + p1,i\u03bb1,i)\n]\n+\n,\n(12)\nwhere [x]+ = max{0, x}, p1,i = (P1\/n), i \u2208 [1, L], and \u03bc is\nthe Lagrange multiplier which moves the constraints in (12)\ninto the maximization cost function PR of the optimization\nproblem. The starting point for \u03bc is\n\u03bcmin = max\ni\u2208[1,L]\n{\n1 + (P1\/n)\u03bb1,i\n(P1\/n)\u03bb1,i\u03bb2,i\n}\nand \u03bc can be updated by using the Newton-Raphson method\n[12] until \u03bc\u0002 is obtained. Let the function\nf(\u03bc) =\nL\u2211\ni=1\np2,i(\u03bc)(1 + (P1\/n)\u03bb1,i)\u2212 P2,\nwhere p2,i(\u03bc) is given in (12), then \u03bc\u0002 is chosen such that it\nfulfills the following inequality f(\u03bc\u0002) < \u000b, with \u000b \b 1.\nConcerning the case where only S-R link CSI is available\nat the R node, I(y2;x) can be expressed as in (6) with G =\nG\u02dcU\u20201 instead of G = V2G\u02dcU\n\u2020\n1 in the FCSI case. Since R\ndoes not have any information about \u03bb2,i as well as V2, in\nour approach, we assume that V2 = Iq and that all the eigen\nmodes of H2 are equal to one, i.e., \u03bb2,i = 1 for all i \u2208 [1, L2].\nAs a result, the optimization problem in (11) is converted to\n526\n5 10 15 20 25\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\nSNR1 (dB)\nM\nut\nua\nl I\nnf\nor\nm\nat\nio\nn \n(bi\nts\/\ns\/H\nz)\n \n \nEG\nMFR\nMMSEF\nEEM\nUB\nI(y; x)\nI(y2; x)\nFig. 2.

NUMERICAL RESULTS\nThe two novel power allocation methods introduced in Sec-\ntion 3, i.e., the analytical method in Section 3.2 and the EEM\nmethod in Section 3.3, are compared against the EG, MFR\nand MMSEF methods, in terms of mutual information and\nBER performance for various number of transmit\/receive an-\ntennas as well as different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) set-\ntings.\nIn our simulations, we denote SNR0 as the SNR of the\nS-D link, SNR1 as the SNR of the S-R link and SNR2 as the\nSNR of the R-D link. Moreover, we have set S = 10 for the\nanalytical UB method and we have used the Matlab function\n\u22124 \u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1 2 3 4\n10\u22126\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\nSNR0 (dB)\nBE\nR\nEEM\nEG\nMFR\nMMSEF\nFCSI\nFig. 3.

For the\nEEM method, we have set \u000b < 1.10\u22125.\nIn the BER performance evaluation, at the source, we\nrely on a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) model\nwhere the information bit sequences are encoded with an op-\ntimum half-rate systematic recursive convolutional code with\ngenerator polynomial (13,15) in octal representation. Then,\nthe interleaved coded bits are QPSK modulated and trans-\nmitted directly over transmit antennas to the other nodes. At\nthe destination an optimum maximum a posteriori (MAP) de-\ntector is used to extract transmitted information from the S\nnode. A single-tap independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d) Rayleigh fading channel is assumed between the var-\nious links, S-D, S-R, and R-D.\nIn Fig. 2, we compare the cooperative and non-cooperative\nmutual information performance of the various power alloca-\ntion methods described in Section 3, for n = q = r = 4,\nSNR0 = 0 dB and SNR2 = 10 dB. First, the results con-\nfirm that our UB method outperforms all the other methods\nand hence provides an UB for AF mutual information perfor-\nmance. Moreover, our novel EEM method performs as good\nas EG for low and medium values of SNR1 and yet far bet-\nter than EG for high SNR1 values. Our EEM method also\noutperforms MMSEF and MFR for any SNR1 values.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4, we present the cooperative BER perfor-\nmance of the various power allocation methods described in\nSection 3 as well as the FCSI method [7, 8], for n = q =\nr = 2 and n = q = r = 4, respectively, and considering\nSNR1 = 10 dB and SNR2 = 15 dB. The graphs indicate\nthat the EEM method outperforms all the other traditional\ntechniques including EG, MFR and MMSEF, when only re-\nceive CSI is available at the relay.

As a bench-\nmark, the BER performance of the FCSI method is also dis-\nplayed. This result shows the performance improvement that\nthe knowledge of the transmit CSI at the relay can bring to\nthe system, but at the cost of a higher complexity compared\nto the EEM method. Similar behaviour can be observed for\nn = q = r = 4, but with larger performance difference be-\ntween the various power allocation techniques, especially, be-\ntween the FCSI method and the receive CSI only techniques.\nIn this SNR setting, given the fact that SNR1 and SNR2 are\nfairly high in comparison with SNR0, the performance of the\ndirect communication is worse than the one of cooperative\ncommunication, and consequently, the direct communication\nperformance has not been plotted here.\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, two novel power allocation methods for non-\nregenerative cooperative MIMO communication have been\nproposed. Both these methods are based on the maximiza-\ntion of the mutual information of the relay link when only\nreceive CSI is available at the relay. The first method is an\nanalytical solution which maximizes the expectation of the\nmutual information, and it has been implemented via a high-\ncomplexity recursive algorithm. The second method is solv-\ning a concave optimization problem with a low-complexity\nof implementation. Numerical results presented in this pa-\nper have shown that both methods outperform other common\nrelay receive CSI only power allocation techniques in terms\nof mutual information and BER. In the future, novel power\nallocation techniques for the case where the transmit CSI is\nknown at the S node will be investigated.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] J. N. Laneman and G. W.
