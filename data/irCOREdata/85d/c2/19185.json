A long term need for analgesics and non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is common, with\nmany people also using non-pharmacological measures\nand complementary therapies [2,3]. However, previous\nresearch suggests that patients with arthritis commonly do\nnot take NSAIDs as prescribed; taking pain medication in\nlower doses and less frequently than recommended [4].\nAnalgesics may be more effective for people with chronic\npain when taken regularly and pre-emptively, thus\ndecreasing the peak-and-trough effect of intermittent dos-\ning. This, at least theoretically, enables more continuous\npain relief [5] and reduces the likelihood of movement\nrelated pain. Research into arthritis patients' use of pain\nkillers has traditionally focused on adherence to NSAIDs\n[6]. Methods of measuring compliance have included\nrecording proportion of medication taken [7], assaying\ndrug levels [8], self-reported adherence [9-11] and record-\ning non-adherent behaviours such as missing doses [7]. In\nchronic conditions such as arthritis analgesics may be pre-\nscribed to be taken 'as needed' especially where the sever-\nity of pain fluctuates, so we have chosen to investigate the\npattern of patients' use of pain killers rather than their\nactual adherence to prescribed regimens. In this study\n'patterns' refers to the way in which people take analgesics\non a daily basis.\nSelf-efficacy is defined as an individual's judgement of\ntheir capability to carry out a course of action required to\nachieve a desired goal [12] and in this study refers to a\npatient's perception of their ability to manage arthritis\nand its symptoms. Higher self-efficacy scores have been\nassociated with better adherence to non-analgesic medica-\ntion [13,14], lower pain intensity [15,16] and less func-\ntional impairment [17-19]. The relationship between self\nefficacy, pain and patterns of analgesic use is unclear. The\naims of this study were to explore patterns of analgesic use\namong patients attending rheumatology clinics and the\nrelationship between analgesic use, self-efficacy, pain and\ndemographic characteristics.\nMethods\nSetting & Population\nOur study was conducted in the outpatient rheumatology\nclinics of Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, which were\nprovided by 11 clinicians. The majority of patients had\nsome form of arthritis; a minority had some form of soft\ntissue musculoskeletal pain. Patients attending rheuma-\ntology clinics suffer mostly from an inflammatory arthritis\nand commonly endure skeletal pains from a variety of\ncauses, including secondary osteoarthritis and myofacial\npains [20]. We chose not to seek any further diagnostic\ninformation as we were interested in this heterogeneous\npopulation as a whole and the way these individuals\nresponded to musculoskeletal pain. The term arthritis will\nbe used in this article to describe the problems suffered by\nour study population.\nConsecutive patients with any form of arthritis or pain of\nleast 3 months duration and who were able to speak Eng-\nlish were approached. Eligible patients were given an\ninformation leaflet and those giving written consent were\nasked to complete a questionnaire. Data were collected\nover 4 weeks during February and March 2007. Patients\nwith a shorter history of arthritis were excluded because\nwe wished to study established patterns of analgesic use\nand we believed that 3 months was a reasonable period\nfor these to develop. Questionnaires were self-completed\nby 81.2% of patients. One researcher (RB) recorded the\nresponses of those unable to write either due to arthritis\naffecting their hands or ability to speak but not write Eng-\nlish.\nPatients unable to complete questionnaires during their\nvisit to the clinic were given a reply paid pre-addressed\nenvelope and asked to return it by mail. Those who had\nnot returned their questionnaire within two weeks were\nsent a reminder and a new questionnaire by mail (Figure\n1).\nPatient recruitmentFigure 1\nPatient recruitment.\n \n  Total population: 317 \nEligible: 257 \nQuestionnaires \ncompleted in clinic: 209 \nQuestionnaires \nposted: 17 \nMissed: 25 Ineligible: 35:- \n \nNo arthritis: 6 \nDiagnosed <3 months: 25 \n'LGQ\u00b6W\u0003VSHDN\u0003(QJOLVK\u001d\u0003\u0017 \n  Returned: 9 Reminded: 8 \nReturned: 0 Questionnaires \ncompleted 218 (85%) \nAgreed: 226 Declined: 31 Page 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:137 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/137Questionnaires\nDemographic data including gender, age, ethnicity (classi-\nfied according to the 2001 census) [21] and duration of\narthritis were collected. The shorter 8-item version of the\nArthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) was used to assess self-\nefficacy for managing arthritis [22]. The ASES has been\nshown to have acceptable construct and concurrent valid-\nity and test-retest reliability [22]. The short-form version\nhas been demonstrated to have good psychometric char-\nacteristics (high internal consistency [Cronbach's alpha =\n0.89] and minimal floor and ceiling effects) [17]. In order\nto make this questionnaire more understandable for Brit-\nish patients the word 'blue' in the phrase 'if you are feeling\nblue' was replaced by the word 'low'. Each question of the\nASES self-efficacy scale was answered on a scale of 1 to 10\n(1 being very uncertain - low self-efficacy; 10 being very\ncertain - high self-efficacy). The mean of the responses\ngave the self-efficacy rating. Pain was assessed by using the\nWestern Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthri-\ntis Index (WOMAC) pain sub-scale. Each of 5 questions is\nanswered on a five point Likert scale (0 = no pain to 4 =\nextreme pain), the summation of which gives the partici-\npant's pain score. The WOMAC scale is widely used and its\nvalidity and reliability have been established in rheuma-\ntoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) [23,24].\nA series of statements was used to assess patients' pattern\nof analgesic use. (Table 1) In this study the term 'analge-\nsics' included paracetamol (acetaminophen), compound\nanalgesics (including paracetamol and codeine) and\nNSAIDs. Standard measures of adherence, such as propor-\ntion of medication taken, were not used in this study for\nseveral reasons. Firstly it was our intention to investigate\nhow patients are using their analgesics, not simply if they\nwere taking a certain amount. Secondly analgesics are\noften not prescribed to be taken a certain number of times\na day but 'as needed'. Also, patients in pain may not be\nreceiving prescription analgesics or NSAIDs but may be\ntaking over the counter preparations.\nIt was our aim to investigate how patients managed their\nanalgesics in relation to their pain and related factors such\nas exercise and sleep. A recent study exploring osteoarthri-\ntis patients' management of pain and analgesics found\nthat many patients varied their use of pain killers and were\noften reluctant to take analgesics unless unable to tolerate\nthe pain [4]. Accordingly, statements relating to regular\nuse; use only in significant pain and varying use depend-\ning on level of pain were included in this study. Both oste-\noarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can be characterised by\nflare ups and remissions of symptoms. A statement relat-\ning to changes in analgesic use during flare ups was there-\nTable 1: Pattern of analgesic use according to severity of pain\nStatement Number (%) of patients agreeing* with statement in each pain category (score range)\nNone (n = 6)\n(0 to <0.5)\nSlight (n = 26)\n(0.5 to <1.5)\nModerate (n = 100)\n(1.5 to <2.5)\nSevere (n = 62)\n(2.5 to <3.5)\nExtreme (n = 17)\n(3.5 to 4)\n1.

Sale et al. [4] also found that many\npatients had been advised to take analgesics before activ-\nity; however their participants did not report taking their\nanalgesics in this way. Pain can often cause sleeping prob-\nlems for patients with arthritis. A study involving clients\nfrom the Observational Arthritis Study in Seniors [25]\nfound that 81% of patients had problems with sleep\nmaintenance. We therefore also included statements\nrelated to analgesic use before exercise and sleep. Descrip-\ntors were discussed with clinicians and piloted by eight\npatients before use; no changes were made as a result of\nthe pilot.\nPatients recorded, on a 6-point Likert scale, whether they\nagreed (strongly agree = 6) or disagreed (strongly disagree\n= 1) with each statement. For questions where the more\nstrongly the patient agreed with the statement the less reg-\nularly they took their analgesics, e.g. 'I only take a tablet\nwhen the pain gets too bad,' the scores were reversed. This\nallowed high scores for all questions to relate to more reg-\nular analgesic use. The scores for the four questions\nrelated to regularity of use (1-4 table 1) were then sum-\nmated to provide an overall measure of how regularly\npatients were using analgesics. The internal reliability of\nthe 'analgesic regularity' questionnaire was good, with a\nCronbach's alpha of 0.82. Inter-item correlations ranged\nfrom 0.35 to 0.62 and item-total correlations from 0.49 to\n0.74.\nEthical approval\nEthical approval was granted by the South Birmingham\nResearch Ethics Committee.\nStatistical considerations and analyses\nAll data were entered into Microsoft Excel and statistical\nanalyses were performed in SPSS v15 for Windows. The\nWOMAC pain scores were grouped into 5 categories based\non the original categories used to answer the pain ques-\ntions: no pain (0-0.499), slight pain (0.5-1.499), moder-\nate pain (1.5-2.499), severe pain (2.5-3.499) and extreme\npain (3.5-4). The pattern of analgesic use at each level of\npain was examined. T-Tests were also used to examine the\ndifferences in mean pain score between those agreeing\nand disagreeing with statements regarding analgesic use.\nAs this involved multiple comparisons a more conserva-\ntive significance level (p < 0.01) was used for these analy-\nses, otherwise p < 0.05 was used. To investigate the\nrelative influence of factors on regularity of analgesic use,\nsimple and multiple regression analyses were undertaken.\nFirstly, simple regression analyses were undertaken\nbetween the predictor variables. A significant relationship\nwas found between age and duration of the disease, but\nboth were retained in the model. Age, gender, ethnicity,\nduration of disease, severity of pain and self-efficacy were\nentered simultaneously into the model. Ethnicity was\nentered as a binary variable (white British or other ethnic\ngroup) due to the relatively small number of participants\nfrom a minority ethnic group. An analysis of the residuals\nidentified that they were normally distributed, so the\nassumptions for the model were met. Similar methods\nwere used to investigate the influence of age, gender, eth-\nnicity, duration of disease, regularity of analgesic use and\nself-efficacy on reported pain.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nTwo hundred and eighteen patients completed question-\nnaires, providing a response rate of 85% (figure 1). The\nmean age of participants was 55 years (SD 14.8), 155\n(71%) were female and patients had had arthritis for a\nmedian of 10 years (IQR 5, 20). Six (2.8%) patients\nreported having no current pain, 26 (12.3%) described\ntheir pain as slight, 100 (47.4%) moderate, 62 (29.4%)\nsevere and 17 (8.1%) extreme. A majority of patients were\nwhite (183, 84%), twenty one (10%) Asian or British\nAsian, seven (3%) were mixed race and seven (3%) had a\nBlack, or Black British background.\nUse of analgesics\nUse of paracetamol (acetaminophen) was reported by 65\n(29.8%) of participants; compound analgesics (including\nparacetamol and codeine) by 111 (50.9%) and NSAIDs\nby 71 (32.6%).\nPattern of analgesic use\nThe majority of patients in extreme pain reported always\ntaking their analgesics everyday, falling to less than a third\nof those in no pain. A large proportion of those in no (cur-\nrent) pain and slight pain reported only taking analgesics\nwhen they felt their pain was too severe, a practice less\ncommon amongst those in greater pain; yet almost one\nthird of patients in extreme pain still only used analgesics\nwhen their pain became 'too bad'. A large proportion of\npatients with all severities of pain varied how they took\ntheir analgesics depending on their level of pain. Patients\nin slight or no pain were much more likely to only take\nanalgesics regularly during 'bad patches' than those in\nextreme pain. Details are given in table 1.\nThe proportion of patients reporting taking analgesics\nbefore bed increased with the level of pain suffered. There\nwas no distinct pattern in those who took analgesics\nbefore exercise. Very few of those in slight or no pain took\nanalgesics before exercise compared with approximately\none third of those in moderate and severe pain and one\nquarter of patients in extreme pain.\nPatients who reported always taking their analgesics daily\nhad a higher mean pain score than those who did not\n(details shown in table 2). Those who reported only tak-Page 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:137 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/137ing analgesics when the pain got too bad had a lower pain\nscore compared with those who did not. There was no sig-\nnificant difference in pain severity between those who var-\nied how they took their analgesics depending on their\nlevel of pain and those who did not. However, there was\na trend towards those who varied their analgesics in this\nway having slightly lower pain scores. Patients who only\ntook their analgesics regularly when they were having a\nbad patch reported less pain than those who did not. In\nterms of pre-emptive analgesic use, patients taking their\ntablets before bed reported higher pain scores than those\nwho did not, but this was not significant. There was no\nsignificant difference in pain related to taking analgesics\nbefore exercise.\nPredictors of regularity of analgesic use\nIn simple linear regression, pain was the only variable sig-\nnificantly associated with regularity of analgesic use: a\ngreater pain score (i.e. more pain) corresponded to more\nregular analgesic use. With multiple linear regression only\npain was significantly associated with regularity of analge-\nsic use (Table 3).\nPredictors of pain severity\nThe degree of pain reported was not associated with age,\ngender or duration of arthritis, but was significantly asso-\nciated with self-efficacy, regularity of analgesic use and\nethnicity. Greater self-efficacy corresponded to less pain.\nPatients from ethnic minorities had an average pain score\nof 12.4 compared to 10.9 (p = 0.034) for those of white\nBritish ethnicity in simple linear regression (Table 3). In\nmultiple linear regression where age, gender, duration of\narthritis, ethnicity, regularity of analgesic use and self-effi-\ncacy were entered simultaneously, lower self efficacy and\nregular use of analgesics remained significantly associated\nwith more pain.\nSpecific self-management techniques\nPatients commonly used other methods of managing\npain. Many used rest (180, 84%), exercise (116, 54%),\nheat (101, 47%) or a bath or a spa (83, 38%). Forty two\n(20%) were currently being treated by a physiotherapist\nand 40 (19%) participants reported using a form of com-\nplementary therapy.\nDiscussion\nIn this study we have explored the way in which patients\nattending rheumatology clinics manage their analgesics,\nand the relationships between pain, self-efficacy and how\nregularly analgesics are used.\nPrevious studies indicate that patients with RA [26] and\nOA [4] may be taking analgesics less frequently than pre-\nscribed: a finding that was replicated in our study. We\nfound, however, that people in more pain tended to take\nanalgesics more regularly and pre-emptively (particularly\nbefore sleep). (The size of the difference in WOMAC pain\nscores between those agreeing and disagreeing with state-\nments regarding regularity of use is similar to that\nobtained by analgesic medication in patients with arthritis\n[27]). However, patterns of pre-emptive analgesic use\nbefore exercise were more complex. Those with moderate\npain more frequently took medication before exercise\nthan those with slight pain, but those in severe pain were\nless likely to do so, perhaps because exercise capacity was\nlimited in those with severe pain or our study may have\nbeen underpowered to detect a difference. By contrast a\nsmaller but similar study of RA patients found no relation-\nship between pain and regularity of analgesic use [28].\nTable 2: T-Tests exploring differences in reported pain between those agreeing and disagreeing with pain management strategies\nStatement Agree with statement Disagree with statement\nMean pain score Standard deviation Mean pain score Standard deviation p-value\n1.

A large\nproportion of patients, however, varied their use of anal-\ngesics depending on their current level of pain; including\nover a third of people reporting severe pain, who only\nused their medication on demand, or at times when pain\nwas unbearable. This approach is at odds with recommen-\ndations in guidelines for health professionals, in which\npre-emptive and regular use of analgesics is recommended\nin order to prevent breakthrough and movement related\npain [29]. Recent draft guidance from the National Insti-\ntute for Health and Clinical Excellence recognised the sur-\nprising lack of data on how patients use analgesics in OA\n[28,30]. Also surprisingly, publications for patients by\nrespected arthritis organisations provide no guidance on\nhow analgesics should be used [31], although it is relevant\nthat disease knowledge is poorly related to patients'\nbeliefs about medication [32]. Education and advice\nabout analgesic use is likely to be provided by clinicians\nduring normal clinical contacts. The clinic from which\nthese patients were drawn also ran education classes for\npatients with newly diagnosed inflammatory arthritis.\nHowever, it is likely that few of the patients in this study\nTable 3: Factors affecting reported pain and regularity of analgesic use: Simple and multiple linear regression.\nVariable Factors affecting regularity of analgesic use Factors affecting pain severity\nSimple Linear Regression Multiple Linear Regression* Simple Linear Regression Multiple Linear \nRegression#\n\u03b2\n(9%% CI)\nSE p value \u03b2\n(95% CI)\nSE p value \u03b2\n(95% CI)\nSE p value \u03b2\n(95% CI)\nSE p\nvalue\nPain 0.35\n(0.12 to \n0.58)\n0.12 0.003 0.37\n(0.11 to \n0.63)\n0.13 0.006 - - - - - -\nSelf-efficacy -0.15\n(-0.67 to \n0.38)\n0.27 0.578 0.09\n(-0.49 to \n0.67)\n0.29 0.768 -0.85\n(-1.13 to -\n0.58)\n0.14 <0.001 -0.82\n(-1.13 to -\n0.52)\n0.16 <0.001\nGender 0.83\n(-1.40 to \n3.06)\n1.13 0.464 0.64\n(-0.60 to \n2.87)\n1.13 0.574 0.58\n(-0.68 to \n1.84)\n0.64 0.368 0.52\n(-0.77 to \n1.80)\n0.65 0.431\nAge 0.04\n-0.03 to 0.1)\n0.03 0.245 0.04\n(-0.03 to \n0.11)\n0.04 0.308 0.01\n(-0.03 to \n0.05)\n0.02 0.53 0.01\n(-0.03 to \n0.05)\n0.02 0.541\nEthnicity 1.69\n(-0.68 to \n4.07)\n1.20 0.161 0.98\n(-1.54 to 3.5)\n1.28 0.446 1.46\n(0.12 to \n2.81)\n0.68 0.034 1.39\n(0.04 to \n2.82)\n0.73 0.057\nDisease \nduration\n0.04\n(-0.05 to \n0.14)\n0.05 0.4 0.03\n(-0.08 to \n0.13)\n0.05 0.629 -0.01\n(-0.07 to \n0.05)\n0.03 0.68 -0.01\n(-0.07 to \n0.05)\n0.03 0.769\nRegularity of \nanalgesic use\n- - - - - - 0.14\n(0.05 to \n0.23)\n0.05 0.003 0.12\n(0.04 to \n0.21)\n0.04 0.006\n*Percentage of explained variance 3.7\nVariables adjusted for: pain, self-efficacy, gender, age, ethnicity, disease duration\n# Percentage of explained variance 13.5\nVariables adjusted for: self-efficacy, gender, age, ethnicity, disease duration, regularity of analgesic usePage 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:137 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/137had recently attended such classes: the median duration\nof arthritis in our population was 10 years.\nAnalgesic medication appears to be seen differently to\nother medications in that purposeful dose restraint is\ncommon and often seen as acceptable [4]. Patients may\nhave many reasons for limiting their intake of analgesics\nin this way. A dislike of tablet taking despite, paradoxi-\ncally, relatively common use of complementary medica-\ntions has been previously found and is supported by our\nstudy [4]. Fears about dependency have also been well\nreported [4] and, in our experience, patients often express\nconcerns about developing tolerance to analgesics. Use of\nregular medication is perceived by many people to indi-\ncate a loss of autonomy and to imply weakness [33]. Lim-\niting analgesic consumption may, like the widespread use\nof complementary therapies, reflect an affirmation of\nautonomy or personal empowerment [34]. Beliefs and\nconcerns about medicines are reported to influence adher-\nence to medication. Indeed, medication beliefs have been\nfound to have a greater influence on adherence in chronic\nillness than clinical and sociodemographic factors [35].\nA variety of psychosocial factors are known to influence\npain severity, which in turn may influence patterns of\nanalgesic use. We found, like others [36], that patients\nfrom ethnic minorities reported more pain. However,\nonly 35 (16%) patients from ethnic minorities were\nincluded in our population. This also prevented us from\nexploring the differences in pattern of analgesic use by\nseverity of pain in each ethnicity, as the number of\npatients in each category was very small.\nA measure of self efficacy was included in our analysis.\nThis is a task specific trait [15] which seeks to ascertain\nhow capable an individual believes they are of carrying\nout a course of action or behaviour needed to achieve a\ngoal [12]; here, the management of their pain. The con-\ncept of self-efficacy is widely accepted and acknowledged\nto be important in the study of pain. We found, like others\n[37], that patients with higher perceived self efficacy\nreported less pain. Cross-sectional measurements of self-\nefficacy are believed to be a meaningful indicator of daily\npain and coping, with greater self-efficacy often leading to\nmore effective pain coping mechanisms [28]. Indeed, peo-\nple with high levels of self efficacy (for pain) have\nreported less pain then those with low self-efficacy when\nsubjected to painful stimuli in a laboratory [37]. Self effi-\ncacy was not, however, associated with regularity of anal-\ngesic use reported in our study, after the influence of pain\nwas taken into account. No other measures were included\nin our study and whilst many have overlapping features,\nother psychological measures may have provided more\ninsight into the reasons behind patterns of analgesic use.\nThe low variance explained by the multivariate models for\nseverity of pain (R213.5%) and for regularity of analgesic\nuse (R23.7%) highlight the fact that that other psycholog-\nical factors may be more influential. Beliefs about pain\nand analgesics [38,39], coping mechanisms [28], depres-\nsion [40,41], anxiety [41] and psychological stress [42]\nmay all be of importance in understanding patients' expe-\nrience of arthritis, pain and their analgesic use.\nOur study was cross-sectional and therefore has important\nlimitations particularly because we do not know whether\nthe patterns of analgesic use and perceived self efficacy,\nremain stable and whether the correlations reported hold\ntrue over time. To achieve a high response rate and gener-\nalisability we focused on the factors relating to pain that\nwe were most interested in, such as self-efficacy. However\nwe acknowledge that the investigation of other factors\nsuch as depression is important and may be worth further\nstudy in the future. We did not assess the psychometric\nproperties of the patterns of analgesic use scale prior to its\nuse in this study. It was not our intention to develop a new\nscale and to report the properties of this scale. We chose\nour questions to gain an insight into how patients man-\naged their analgesics on a daily basis. A majority of ques-\ntionnaires were self-completed (81%) but in 19% of cases\n(41 participants) a researcher recorded the answers. The\nmost common reason for this was difficulty with writing\ndue to arthritis; only 3 of the 41 participants who were\nassisted were from an ethnic minority. Considering that\n16% of the total study population were from ethnic\nminorities, problems in participants' ability to write Eng-\nlish were not a significant factor in this study and are\nunlikely to result in any bias. Important strengths of our\nstudy were an excellent response rate, use of well validated\nmeasures, a heterogeneous population, inclusion of con-\nsecutive patients and availability of a researcher to help\nwith clarification when patients were completing ques-\ntionnaires.\nConclusion\nWe found that self-efficacy, regularity of analgesic use and\nethnicity influenced the degree of pain reported by\npatients. The majority of patients in this hospital outpa-\ntient sample (85%) reported moderate or more severe\npain. People with greater pain reported more regular anal-\ngesic use but a large proportion of patients, including\nsome in severe pain, varied their consumption of analge-\nsics greatly. This may be because of patients' beliefs and\nconcerns about medications. Health professionals who\nrecognise such concerns during consultations may be bet-\nter able to guide patients and encourage more optimal\npatterns of analgesic use and promote better function.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Page 7 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:137 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/137Authors' contributions\nRB was involved in the conception and design of the\nstudy, collected data, did statistical analyses and drafted\nthe manuscript.
