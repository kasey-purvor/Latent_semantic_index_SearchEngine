This novel endocrine system may contribute to the pathophysiology\nof HF.\nINTRODUCTION\nHF (heart failure) is associated with progressive\nimpairment of sodium and water homoeostasis [1].\nGuanylin [2] and uroguanylin [3] are 15- and 16-amino-\nacid peptides with natriuretic activity involved in the\nregulation of sodium balance in response to oral salt\nintake [4]. Both are synthesized as inactive precursors,\nproguanylin and prouroguanylin, which undergo post-\nsecretory processing by proteolytic cleavage to produce\ntheir respective active moieties [5,6].\nGuanylin and uroguanylin produce their natriuretic\neffect by binding and activating cell-surface GC-C\n(guanylate cyclase C) receptors located on gut mucosal\nand renal tubular epithelial cells initiating a cGMP-\nmediated second messenger cascade [7]. Guanylin\nand uroguanylin have also been shown to induce\nnatriuresis in knockout mice lacking the GC-C receptor,\ndemonstrating a GC-C-independent pathway [8].\nA previous study demonstrated a 70-fold increase\nin uroguanylin-like bioactivity in the urine of patients\nwith HF compared with healthy controls, suggesting an\nKey words: heart failure, natriuretic peptide, hypertension, proguanylin, prouroguanylin, sodium balance.\nAbbreviations:GC-C, guanylate cyclase C; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HF, heart failure; LV, left ventricular; LVEF,\nLV ejection fraction; LVWMI, LV wall motion index; NYHA, New York Heart Association.\nCorrespondence: Professor Leong L.

However, this evidence was derived from\nbioassays, which lack the specificity of immunoassays\nand, thus, it was unclear whether urinary uroguanylin\nconcentration was elevated. Forte [10] has suggested that\nuroguanylin may help regulate sodium balance via an\nintestinal\u2013renal natriuretic axis, as it is observed that oral\nsalt intake produces a more rapid natriuresis than an\nequivalent intravenous sodium load in healthy subjects\n[11].\nWe hypothesized that plasma proguanylin and\nprouroguanylin are elevated inHF as part of the counter-\nregulatory response to salt and water retention. Thus we\nmeasured the plasma concentrations of these peptides in\npatients admitted to hospital with HF and assessed the\nrelationship of their levelswith cardiac and renal function.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy population\nWe included 243 consecutive patients referred to a tertiary\nreferral cardiology centre in the present study. The\npresent study abided by the Declaration of Helsinki\nand was approved by the local ethics committee.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all of the\npatients.\nHF was diagnosed in patients fulfilling the following\ntwo diagnostic criteria: (i) a history of worsening or new-\nonset shortness of breath, and (ii) compatible clinical\nsigns of pulmonary rales, or elevated jugular venous\npressure or peripheral oedema. Patients could already\nhave a diagnosis of chronic HF or be a first-presentation\nof acute HF. Exclusion criteria were known malignancy\nor surgery in the previous month. Renal function was\nassessed using plasma creatinine and eGFR (estimated\nglomerular filtration rate), calculated from the simplified\nformula derived from the MDRD (Modification of Diet\nand Renal Disease) study, validated in patients with HF\n[12].\nPlasma samples\nBlood samples were drawn on presentation with HF\nfor determination of plasma levels of proguanylin and\nprouroguanylin. After 15 min of bed rest, 20 ml of blood\nwas collected into tubes containing EDTA and aprotinin.\nAll plasmawas stored at\u221270 \u25e6Cuntil assayed in a blinded\nfashion in a single batch.\nEchocardiography\nTransthoracic echocardiography was performed in\npatients with a Sonos 5500 instrument (Philips Medical\nSystems). A 16-segment LVWMI [LV (left ventricular)\nwall motion index] based on the American Society of\nEchocardiography mode was derived by scoring each\nleft ventricle segment (1=normal; 2=hypokinesis; and\n3= akinesis) and dividing the total by the number\nof segments scored. LVEF (LV ejection fraction) was\ncalculated with the biplane method of discs formula.\nImpaired LV systolic function was defined as an LVEF\n\u000240% or an LVWMI \u00031.8.\nProguanylin and prouroguanylin assays\nThese assays were performed using antibodies and\nstandards from Biovendor. Polyclonal antibodies to\nproguanylin or prouroguanylinwere coated on to ELISA\nplates. Plasma samples (20 \u03bcl for proguanylin and 50 \u03bcl\nfor prouroguanylin) were pipetted into the ELISA\nplate wells together with appropriate standards up to\n10 or 20 ng\/ml respectively. After incubation for 1 h\nat room temperature (25 \u25e6C), the plates were washed\nand then the conjugated secondary polyclonal antibody\nwas pipetted into the wells for incubation for another\n1 h. The prouroguanylin antibody was a biotinylated\nantibody, and the subsequent detection step usedmethyl-\nacridinium ester-labelled streptavidin on an MLX plate\nluminometer (Dynex Technologies). The proguanylin\nantibody was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase,\nand subsequent detection used a colorimetric substrate\n(3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine) measured on a Dynex\nmicroplate reader with absorbance at 450 nm. The lower\nlimits of detection for proguanylin and prouroguanylin\nwere 0.45 and 0.65 ng\/ml respectively. The recoveries of\nproguanylin andprouroguanylin at 5 ng\/mlwere 93.6 and\n101.8% respectively. Inter-assay coefficients of variation\nwere 7.9% (at 13 ng\/ml proguanylin; n= 8) and 3.5%\n(at 2 ng\/ml prouroguanylin; n= 8). There was no cross-\nreactivity of proguanylin in the prouroguanylin assay and\nvice versa.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed on SPSS version 16.\nBetween-groupdifferences (healthy volunteers compared\nwith patients with HF) in plasma proguanylin and\nprouroguanylin concentrations and in demographics\nand clinical variables were compared using the\nMann\u2013Whitney U test. Associations between plasma\nproguanylin and prouroguanylin levels and clinical\nvariables were determined by Spearman correlations. The\nassociation between NYHA (New York Heart Associ-\nation) class and plasma proguanylin and prouroguanylin\nconcentrations was assessed using one-way ANOVA\nof log-transformed values with post-hoc correction for\nmultiple comparisons conducted using the Bonferroni\ncorrection.The ability of demographic factors and clinical\nvariables to influence proguanylin and prouroguanylin\nlevels was assessed using the General Linear Model with\nlog-transformed plasma proguanylin or prouroguanylin\nconcentrations as the dependent variable.

In post-hoc analyses, plasma proguanylin\nlevels in patients with NYHA class III [8.43 (2.51\u2013\n79.0) \u03bcg\/l] and class IV [8.83 (3.42\u201338.0) \u03bcg\/l] were\nsignificantly (P< 0.0005) greater than in healthy controls\n[5.69 (0.42\u201322.3) \u03bcg\/l] and those in NYHA class I [4.81\n(0.95\u201314.6)\u03bcg\/l].

In multivariate general linear model\nanalysis, the only independent predictors of proguanylin\nand prouroguanylin levels were a history of hyper-\ntension and lower eGFR (Tables 3 and 4).\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of the present study demonstrate that plasma\nproguanylin and prouroguanylin levels are elevated\nin patients with HF. We have shown further that\nplasma proguanylin and prouroguanylin levels were\nindependently associated with impaired renal function\nand hypertension, with a trend of increasing plasma\nproguanylin and prouroguanylin levels with increasing\nseverity of HF as measured by the NYHA class.\nThese results complement those of Carrithers et al.\n[9], who found evidence of increased urinary uroguanylin\nbioactivity in patients with HF. Increased plasma\nproguanylin and prouroguanylin levels in HF are\nmost likely as a result of impaired renal clearance\nleading to accumulation. Acute renal impairment\nhas been demonstrated to reduce the clearance of\ncirculating prouroguanylin, thus increasing its plasma\nlevels [13].Decreased glomerular filtration of plasma pro-\nuroguanylin would result in reduced delivery of the\nC\u00a9 The Authors Journal compilation C\u00a9 2010 Biochemical Society\n372 H.

It is unknown at\npresent the extent of the contribution of filtered\nprouroguanylin and tubular prouroguanylin to the\nurinary uroguanylin bioactivity in HF, and whether\ntubular production of the prohormone is up-regulated\nin HF.\nA further possibility is the increased synthesis of\nproguanylin and prouroguanylin in patients with HF.\nThe site of increased synthesis is most probably the\nintestine, as this has been shown to be the major\nsource of circulating prouroguanylin that undergoes\nC\u00a9 The Authors Journal compilation C\u00a9 2010 Biochemical Society\nProguanylin and prouroguanylin in heart failure 373\npost-secretory processing in the renal tubules [13,14].\nThe lack of a significant correlation between plasma\nprouroguanylin and proguanylin levels with LV dimen-\nsions or LVEF suggests that their synthesis may not be\ndirectly mediated by the pathophysiological processes\ninvolved in HF. Dieplinger et al. [15] have reported\nrecently that both proguanylin and prouroguanylin\nhave limited diagnostic utility as biomarkers for acute\nHF in patients presenting with acute dyspnoea, which\nindicates that long- rather than short-term processes\nmay be responsible for elevations of their plasma\nlevels.\nUp-regulation of guanylin and uroguanylin synthesis\nhas been observed in the renal [16] and intestinal\n[17] tissues of rats fed a high-salt diet. Changes in\nthe intestinal mucosal microenvironment observed in\nHF as a result of tissue hypoperfusion and mesenteric\nischaemia could potentially influence peptide synthesis\n[18,19].\nForte [10] has hypothesized that prouroguanylin\nsecreted from the intestine in response to oral salt\nloads acts as an endocrine hormone on the renal\ntubule epithelial cells as part of an intestinal\u2013renal\nnatriuretic axis. However, despite elevated plasma\nproguanylin and prouroguanylin and increased urinary\nbioactivity of uroguanylin, there remains a reduced\nnatriuretic response to an oral salt load in subjects\nwith HF compared with healthy subjects [1]. We\npropose there may be renal hyporesponsiveness to\ncirculating plasma prouroguanylin, either from down-\nregulation of uroguanylin receptor expression or altered\nreceptor function. The combined effect of impaired renal\nresponse with reduced renal clearance of circulating\nprouroguanylin would result in diminished natriuretic\nand diuretic activity thus contributing to intravascular\nvolume expansion. This may explain the correlation\nwe observed with elevated plasma pro-peptide levels\nand a history of hypertension. However, our find-\nings are hypotheses-generating, and these possibilities\nremain to be investigated in prospectively designed\nstudies.\nOur present study had several limitations. This\nwas a small pilot study with a limited number of\nhealthy controls and patients with HF for comparison.\nPlasma guanylin, uroguanylin or urine uroguanylin\nwere not measured since immunoassays specific for\nthese small molecules are difficult to construct and\nare not currently available. However, measurement of\nthese products may yield further information about\nthe processing of these natriuretic prohormones that\nmay be altered in HF in decompensated and treated\nscenarios.\nIn conclusion, plasma levels of proguanylin and\nprouroguanylin are increased in patients with HF,\nparticularly in symptomatic patients and those with\nrenal impairment. These novel hormonal systems may\ncontribute to the pathophysiology of salt homoeostasis\nin HF.\nFUNDING\nN.M. is supported by theNuffieldHospital Leicester, and\nH.N. is supported by a British Heart Foundation clinical\nresearch training fellowship [grant number FS\/09\/040].\nWe are also grateful for the support of the Leicester\nCardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit through the\nNational Institute of Health Research.\nREFERENCES\n1 Selektor, Y. and Weber, K.
