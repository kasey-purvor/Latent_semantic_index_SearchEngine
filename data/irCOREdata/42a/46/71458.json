Introduction \nPhase I dose-escalation studies are generally conducted in small samples of \nhealthy male volunteers in order to determine safe doses for later experimentation.  The \ntolerability and safety of the experimental drug are closely monitored, with any adverse \nreactions being noted and pharmacokinetic responses such as AUC and Cmax being \nrecorded.  Formal statistical designs for clinical trials in which binary adverse events are \nrecorded have been studied by many authors, with the Continual Reassessment Method \n(O\u2019Quigley, Pepe and Fisher, 1990) and its modifications being prominent in the \nliterature.  Recent summaries of that methodology can be found in Rosenberger and \nHaines (2002), Chevret (2006) and Ting (2006).  Whitehead et al. (2001, 2006a) \nproposed Bayesian dose-escalation procedures for studies of pharmacokinetic responses \nfrom repeated dosing of healthy volunteers, Zhou et al. (2006) consider escalation based \non bivariate data with one continuous and one binary component, and Zhou et al. (2007) \ndescribe a phase I study in which procedures for monitoring AUC and Cmax values and \nincidence of adverse reactions were operated simultaneously.  Piantadosi and Liu (1996) \ndescribe a dose-escalation procedure based on binary responses of toxicity in which \npharmacokinetic measurements are taken into account.  Their objective was to put \nobservations of toxicity into the context of drug concentration rather than just dose \nadministered, and as subjects were dosed only once in their design, the information was \nused in recommending doses for future subjects.   \nThe methodology presented in this paper was motivated by a phase I dose-\nescalation trial that had been carried out according to a conventional design to \ninvestigate a compound aimed at treating Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder \n(ADHD).  In addition to observing pharmacokinetic responses, investigators also \nrecorded pharmacodynamic responses including pulse rate.  The reason for interest in \npulse rate was that the compound under study shares the same mechanism of action as \n  \n3 \nAtomoxetine, a highly specific presynaptic inhibitor of the noradrenaline \n(norepinephrine) transporter recently approved in the US for the treatment of patients \nwith attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Adverse effects on the \ncardiovascular system, including abnormalities in heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac \nrhythm have been associated with several noradrenergic medications. Under treatment, \nthe mean heart rate and pulse rate increase as a consequence of the mechanism of action \nand its impact on the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.  The increases in blood \npressure and pulse tends to occur early in therapy, stabilise, and then return toward \nbaseline upon drug discontinuation (Wernicke et al., 2003).  Because of the relationship \nbetween these effects and the mechnism of action of the drug on ADHD, elevation of \npulse rate was used as a marker of pharmacological action. \n \n2. The motivating dataset \nThe data concern two cohorts of 9 healthy male volunteers.  Doses investigated were 0, \n20, 40, 80, 120, 180 and 200 mg.  Cohort I participated in periods 1, 3 and 5 of the \nstudy, receiving doses 20, 80 and 180 mg in turn, while Cohort II participated in periods \n2, 4 and 6, receiving doses 40, 120 and 200 mg.   Within each period, six subjects \nreceived the active dose and three placebo, arranged so that each subject received two \nactive doses over the course of the trial.   Several measurements during each dosing \nperiod: here we restrict attention to the AUC, the pulse rate and the incidence of adverse \nevents.  A two week wash out interval separated consecutive dosing periods of the same \ncohort.  Carry over of the drug from one treatment period to the next was neither \nanticipated nor observed.  The study was conducted and interpreted in a conventional \nmanner.  In this section a model is fitted to the data to form the basis of a Bayesian \napproach developed in Section 3.  In Section 4, illustrations of the Bayesian procedure \nare constructed by simulating realistic data from this model. \n  \n4 \nA model for AUC values was specified in terms of yij = log(AUCij + 1), where \nAUCij is the AUC for the i\nth\n subject during the j\nth\n period.  The reason for adding 1s will \nbe explained later, but other than that we follow Whitehead et al. (2001) and model yij \naccording to yij = \u03b2lij + si + \u03b5ij, where lij = log(dij + 1) and dij is the dose administered to \nthe i\nth\n subject during the j\nth\n period.  The random subject effect si and the residual \u03b5ij are \ntaken to be mutually independent normally distributed random variables with mean 0 \nand respective variances \u03c42 and \u03c32.  The within subject correlation is \u03c1 = \u03c42\/(\u03c42 + \u03c32).  \nPlacebo data will not be used to fit the model, but it is constrained to pass through the \norigin since a placebo dose is certain to lead to an AUC of 0.  Figure 1 shows the \nresulting fit of this model to the study data.  Maximum likelihood estimates are \u03b2\u02c6  = \n1.709, 2\u03c4\u02c6  = 0.340 and 2\u03c3\u02c6 = 0.0554, so that \u03c1\u02c6= 0.860.   \nFIGURE 1 NEAR HERE \nThe pulse rate of the i\nth\n subject during the j\nth\n period data was summarised as mij, \nthe maximum increase in pulse rate over baseline during that period.  A quadratic model \nin log(AUC + 1) was fitted to this endpoint: mij = \u03b80 + \u03b81yij + \u03b82yij2 + ri + \u03b4ij, where the \nrandom subject effect ri and the residual \u03b4ij are taken to be mutually independent \nnormally distributed random variables with mean 0 and respective variances \u03b62 and \u03be2.  \nThe within subject correlation is \u03b7 = \u03b62\/(\u03b62 + \u03be2).  The model is fitted to data from all \ndosing periods, including placebo administrations, for which yij is taken to be zero.  \nFigure 2 shows the resulting fit of this model.  Maximum likelihood estimates are 0\u03b8\u02c6  = \n21.486, 1\u03b8\u02c6  = \u22122.169, 2\u03b8\u02c6  = 0.365, \n2\u03b6\u02c6  = 15.631 and 2\u03be\u02c6 = 181.79, so that \u03b7\u02c6= 0.079.  The \nfit of the model appears to be satisfactory, with the relationship being close to horizontal \nbetween placebo and very low active doses, while at higher doses an increasing \nrelationship is seen, as would be anticipated.   The addition of 1 to the AUC before log \ntransformation allows responses to placebo to be included in the model for pulse rate \n  \n5 \nagainst AUC, and the addition of 1 to dose values constrains the linear model relating \nAUC to dose to pass through the origin.   \nFIGURE 2 NEAR HERE \nWhile it is accepted that the quadratic model does not reflect the precise \nrelationship between pulse rate and AUC, it is proposed as a useful working model. One \ndesirable property is that it will result in conservatism during dose-escalation, because \nthe accelerating gradient at higher AUC values will give the appearance that high doses \nare particularly unacceptable.  This would not be true, for example, of a split-line \nmodel. \nRather than counting all adverse events, only \u201cdose limiting events\u201d (DLEs) \nfeatured in analyses.  These are loosely defined as events which would make \ninvestigators concerned about repeating that dose or administering higher doses, and \nmore specifically taken to be any one of a list of events prepared before starting the \nstudy.  The probability of a DLE will be modelled as a logistic regression on \nlog(AUC+1). Denoting the probability that the i\nth\n subject suffers a DLE during the j\nth\n \nperiod by pij, the model logit(pij) = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2yij is fitted to data from active doses only.  \nFor the dataset available, maximum likelihood estimates were 1\u03bb\u02c6  = \u22124.055 and 2\u03bb\u02c6  = \n0.347.  The multivariate approach followed here allows us to relate the risk of a DLE to \nthe amount of the drug absorbed (reflected by AUC), rather than the amount \nadministered (reflected by dose).  The former is thus closer to the underlying \nphysiological mechanism, and makes some indirect allowance for the dependence of \nrepeated observations on a subject.  \nThe three models together describe the multivariate behaviour of AUC, pulse \nrate and DLE observations.  It is being assumed that the occurrence of a DLE is \nconditionally independent of the pulse rate observation, given the AUC value. This is \nreasonable for the adverse events considered here, which took the form of vomiting, \n  \n6 \nheadaches, urinary hesitation and dizziness. Conditions connected with heart rate, such \nas tachycardia, would not be accommodated in such a model. Tachycardia was on the \nlist of events, but occurred only once during the course of the trial.  \n \n3. Bayesian modelling \nFor Bayesian modelling of the AUC data, a normal-gamma prior distribution is used for \nthe parameters \u03b2 and \u03c32: \u03b2\uf8e6\u03c32 ~ N(\u00b5A0, \u03c32QA0\u22121); \u03c3\u22122 ~ Ga(aA0, bA0), while a fixed \nvalue is set for \u03c1.   A similar prior is imposed on the pulse rate data: \u03b8\uf8e6\u03be2 ~ N(\u00b5P0, \n\u03be2QP0\u22121); \u03be\u22122 ~ Ga(aP0, bP0), with a fixed value set for \u03b7.  The posterior distributions \nfollow the pattern given in Whitehead et al. (2006a).  For the DLE data, a Tsutukawa \n(1975) prior density h0(\u03bb1,\uf02c \u03bb2) is used for \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, defined by  \n( ) ( ){ } ( ){ }\n( ){ } ( ){ }\n1 0\n1 0\nv v\n1 2 1 1 2 0\n0 1 2 w w\n1 2 1 1 2 0\nexp y exp y\nh ,\n1 exp y 1 exp y\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03bb +\u03bb \u03bb + \u03bb\n\u03bb \u03bb \u221d\n+ \u03bb + \u03bb + \u03bb +\u03bb\n, \nwhere the parameters vk and wk reflect opinion about the risk of a DLE when \nlog(AUC+1) = yk, k = \u22121, 0.  This prior, and the corresponding posterior, is discussed \nby Whitehead and Williamson (1998). \nThe Bayesian decision procedure concerns the choice of dose to be administered \nto the i\nth\n subject in the j\nth\n treatment period.  The pattern of administering placebo doses \nused in the real study is preserved in the new design.  Thus, for the first cohort patients \n1, 2 and 3 (randomly selected) receive placebo during the first treatment period, patients \n4, 5 and 6 when they return for the third treatment period and patients 7, 8 and 9 during \nthe fifth period.  A similar system operates for the second cohort during treatment \nperiods 2, 4 and 6.  The Bayesian procedure is used to choose which active doses to \nadminister to those due to receive them.  By the j\nth\n treatment period, posterior models \nwill have been developed from the data collected during the first (j \u2212 1) treatment \nperiods.  First, safety constraints will be set to avoid doses likely to lead to an excess \n  \n7 \nplasma concentration or a high risk of a DLE.   Only doses for which the probability \nthat (yij \u2265 L) is less than 0.05 should be administered, and only doses for which the \nprobability of a DLE is less than 0.2.  The former probabilities are found from the \npredictive t-distribution of yij, which is described by Whitehead et al. (2006a), and \nestimated before each dosing period by replacing the unknown coefficients by their \ncurrent posterior modal estimates.  A posterior distribution is available for the subject \neffects relating to those who have previously been observed: for new subjects, the prior \nsubject effect distribution is used.  For the probability of a DLE to be less than 0.2, it is \nnecessary that \u03bb1 + \u03bb2yij < logit(0.2) = \u22121.3863.  A simple approach would be to replace \n\u03bb1 and \u03bb2 by their posterior modal estimates, and yij by its expected value based on the \ndose dij administered and the posterior modal estimates of \u03b2 and si, and determine \nwhether the resulting inequality is valid.  Here, we have used the predictive probability \n \n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n1 2 1 2\n1 2 1 2\nexp y exp y\nP(DLE ) E g(y)dy\n1 exp y 1 exp y\n\uf8f1 \uf8fc\u03bb + \u03bb \u03bb + \u03bb\uf8f4 \uf8f4= =\uf8f2 \uf8fd+ \u03bb + \u03bb + \u03bb + \u03bb\uf8f4 \uf8f4\uf8f3 \uf8fe\n\u222b\u03bb ,                   \nwhere g is the predictive t-density of y.  Only doses for which this integral is less than \n0.2 can be used.  Once more \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are replaced by their posterior modal estimates, \nbut now variation in y and some of the dependency between the DLE risks of the same \nindividual in different dosing periods is allowed for.  \nThe set of available doses that satisfy the two safety constraints can be found for \neach subject in the next dosing period.  These sets might differ from patient to patient \naccording to current knowledge of their individual subject effect.  The final \nrecommendation from the subset of permissible available doses is determined according \nto the predictive distribution of the pulse rate.  A desirable range of values (ML, MU) \nwill be defined, ML denoting the minimal maximum increase consistent with a \nbeneficial effect and MU the maximum safe increase.  Ideally, the dose that maximises \nthe probability that mij \u2208 (ML, MU) should be chosen.  Here, we adopt the simpler but \n  \n8 \nmore tractable criterion of choosing the dose that makes E(mij) closest to \u00bd(ML + MU) \namongst those in the available list of doses that satisfy the two safety constraints.  The \nmethod for computing E(mij) is described in the Appendix.   \n \n4. An illustration of the procedure \nThe settings chosen for this illustration were motivated by the real data collected in the \ncompleted trial.  In practice, discussions with clinical investigators and consideration of \ndata from previous, similar studies would be used to make these choices.  The limiting \nvalue for log(AUC + 1) is to L = 9.7, corresponding to an AUC of approximately 16000 \n\u00b5g h mL\u22121.  The limits for maximum increase in pulse rate are set at ML = 10 bpm and \nMU = 45 bpm.   \nFixed values for within subject correlations of the yij and the mij are taken as \u03c1 = \n0.6 and \u03b7 = 0.3 will be imposed.  Prior information concerning AUC values is \nexpressed as two representative pseudo-observations on a single subject: AUC values of \n550 and 6900 corresponding to doses 40 mg and 180 mg respectively are specified. \nThese lead to a slope of a 1.7, consistently with the observed data.  For the DLE model, \nfollowing and Zhou and Whitehead (2003) prior opinion is expressed by supposing that \n3 \u201cpseudo-subjects\u201d at dose 20 gave 0.6 of a DLE and 3 at dose 200 gave 1.5 DLEs.  \nThis leads to prior modal parameter estimates of \u03bb1 = \u22123.255 and \u03bb2 = 0.361. \nPrior information on pulse rates is represented by three representative pseudo-\nobservations on a single subject.  These were maximum increases over baseline of 21, \n25 and 50 bpm corresponding to AUC values of 0, 1000 and 22,000 respectively.  The \nresulting prior modal parameter estimates are \u03b81 = 21, \u03b82 = \u22124.611 and \u03b83 = 0.751.  This \nprior model predicts pulse rate values corresponding to doses in the region of 20mg to \nbe similar to those expected under placebo.   \n  \n9 \nTo choose the gamma parameters for AUC, aA0 and bA0, it was required that the \nlowest dose have a prior probability of an excessive AUC value equal to 0.05, while for \nthe second dose this probability is 0.067 (see Whitehead et al.; 2001).  This choice \nensures that the only permissible dose for the first cohort will be the lowest dose. The \nparameter values aA0 = 0.42529 and bA0 = 0.0355 follow.  It was not necessary to \nspecify the gamma parameters for the prior distribution of  \u03be\u22122, as the dose escalation \nprocedure depends only on expectations of the mij.  The data used in the following \nsimulation examples were generated using the models described above, with AUC \nparameters set at \u03b2 = 1.709, \u03c32 = 181.79 and \u03c42 = 15.631, pulse rate parameters set at \n\u03b80 = 21.5, \u03b81 = \u22122.17, \u03b82 = 0.36, \u03be2 = 0.0554 and \u03b62 = 0.340 and DLE parameters set at \n\u03bb1 = \u22124.048, and \u03bb2 = 0.347.   \n Each simulated run involved two cohorts of 9 healthy male volunteers and six \ndosing periods.  Cohort I participated in periods 1, 3 and 5 and Cohort II in periods 2, 4 \nand 6.  During each dosing period, three subjects received placebo, arranged so that \neach subject received placebo exactly once.  The doses available were 0, 20, 40, 80, \n120, 180 and 200 mg.  Thus, the simulated studies resembled the real one, except that \ndoses were chosen according to the recommendations of the Bayesian procedure.  To \nenhance comparability of different design options, the investigation began with \nsimulation of two subject responses to each of the available doses.  Then in each run, \nsubject responses were read from this complete dataset.  This ensures that when two \nprocedures coincide in dose allocation, the results of the simulated runs will be the \nsame.   \nBefore studying data from the simulated trials, the real data described in Section \n2 will be revisited.  Figure 3 summarises the responses to each active dose.  Dose \nadministered is plotted against dosing period.  The symbol is heart-shaped if the \nmaximum increase in pulse rate over baseline lies in the target interval (10, 45) bpm, \n  \n10 \nsquare if it lies below 10 and triangular if it lies above 45.  The symbol is printed larger \nif the log(AUC + 1) value exceeded the limit of 9.7, (this occurs only in the actual \ndataset shown in Figure 3), and it is filled if a DLE was observed.  The figure shows \nthat DLEs were quite common, even at the lowest dose, and thus cannot have been \nconsidered to be a particularly vital limitation to escalation.  At the highest dose, the \nAUC limit was exceeded twice.  Suitable pulse rate increases were observed at all dose \nlevels, including the lowest, indicating that raising the dose was not critical for the \nachievement of a potentially pharmacological effect.  \nFIGURE 3 NEAR HERE \nFigure 4 shows the results from a simulated dose-escalation study, depicted in \nthe same way as Figure 3.  The data illustrate some important operating characteristics \nof the methodology.   Excess AUC values are avoided completely.  As satisfactory \npulse rates are found from low doses, the higher range is not entered.  Fewer DLEs are \nobserved.  One subject is given dose 80 during the last period: this subject exhibited \nindividual effects indicating that a higher dose would be both safe and effective.  Thus \nthe procedure can tailor dosing to the individual subject.  \nFIGURE 4 NEAR HERE \nThe escalation shown in Figure 4 is conservative, with only one subject \nadvancing beyond dose 40.  Detailed scrutiny of the data suggests that this is because of \nthe fear of DLEs.  In the actual study, DLEs were observed, and yet escalation \ncontinued.  This suggests that we need not be too concerned about their occurrence. \nConsequently, in the next run of the procedure, the tolerance relating to DLEs was \naltered to ensure that the risk was less that 0.3 rather than the stricter setting of 0.2.  The \nresult is shown in Figure 5.  Doses up to 80mg are now administered to many subjects, \nand dose 120 appears twice.  There are still no excessive AUC values, and a high \nproportion of the subjects have pulse rate increases in the target range.  \n  \n11 \nFIGURE 5 NEAR HERE \n Finally, a third refinement of the dose selection procedure was \ninvestigated.  As subjects become used to taking the drug, and once it is established that \nno harmful rises in heart rate are experienced, the target values for the pulse rate \nmeasure can be progressively increased.  Thus, for dosing periods 1, 2 and 3, ML will \nset at 10, but it will be raised to 20 for periods 4 and 5 and finally to 30 for period 6.   \nWithin this scheme placebo subjects in Cohort II will start with ML = 20, but the \nexperience of Cohort I subjects dosed using the stricter criterion should provide \nsufficient assurance to allow this.  Figure 6 shows the results from a simulated run using \nthese criteria, and with the DLE tolerance set at 0.30.  Now the top dose of 200 is \nreached, but still no excess AUC values are encountered.  Most administrations result in \nan acceptable pulse rate.  In this plot, the symbol is heart-shaped if the maximum \nincrease in pulse rate over baseline lies in the current target interval, with lower limit \n10, 20 or 30 according to dosing period: squares denote values that are too low and \ntriangles values that are too high.    \nFIGURE 6 NEAR HERE \nDuring all three simulation runs, very few dose allocations were constrained by \nthe need to keep the AUC below its limiting value.  This would occur in practice if the \nphysiological target was reached well within the acceptable limit of plasma \nconcentration.  In conventional studies, there is often a desire to learn about the \nmaximum tolerated dose of a drug.  If therapeutic value can be found well within the \ntolerable range, knowledge of the maximum may not be pharmacologically important.  \nIt certainly may not be needed prior to the proof-of-concept studies that may lead to \nmore extensive clinical development.  Escalating to find the maximum tolerated dose is \npotentially one of the most hazardous parts of healthy volunteer testing, although it may \n  \n12 \neventually be needed to determine the properties of or adverse reactions to the drug if \noverdosing occurs once the drug becomes widely available. \nTable 1 presents maximum likelihood estimates from all three simulated runs.  \nMaximum likelihood is used to avoid the influence of the prior information in this final \nanalysis.  The estimates from the run shown in Figure 6 are the most accurate and have \nthe smallest standard errors, which follows because this run involved the widest range \nof doses.  In the other runs, \u03c32 is overestimated and \u03c42 is underestimated, consistently \nwith the findings of Whitehead et al. (2006a).  In all runs \u03be2 is substantially \nunderestimated.  Table 1 also presents the maximum safe doses d*AUC and d*DLE under \nthe AUC and DLE criteria, and the ideal dose d*pulse for achieving the target dose.  \nThese are underestimated in the runs shown in Figures 4 and 5 and overestimated in that \nshown in Figure 6.  \n \nTABLE 1 NEAR HERE \nAll runs were completed using the predictive probability P(DLE \uf8ec\u03bb) described in \nSection 3.  Earlier runs using the simpler approach in which yij is replaced by its \nexpected value based on the dose dij administered gave the same dosing pattern.  The \nexact values of the maximum safe doses d*AUC and d*DLE under the AUC and DLE \ncriteria, and the ideal dose d*pulse for achieving the target dose were different, but the \nclosest suitable doses amongst those available were unchanged.   \n \n5. Discussion \nThis paper addresses issues of dose escalation in early phase studies in which a \npharmacodynamic response that is predictive of the mechanism of action of the drug \nfollows closely after administration of the drug and is quickly available.  The rationale \nfor anticipating that moderate elevation of pulse rate will indicate therapeutic value in \n  \n13 \nADHD has been explained in Section 1.  In other settings, different pharmacodynamic \nendpoints might be used.  Whitehead et al. (2006b) discuss examples including the \nobservation of anti-factor Xa activity as being indicative of thromboembolic disorders \nor inhibition of leukotriene B4 being indicative of anti-inflammatory activity.  In the \ncurrent application, a quadratic model was used for the relationship between \ntransformed versions of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic responses.  This \ncould be applied as a conservative alternative to a break point model or to the lower part \nof an Emax model: conservative in the sense that higher doses will appear more \ndangerous under the quadratic model and will thus be avoided until sufficient evidence \nof their safety has been collected.  The authors recognise that each clinical study is \nunique, and that the details of other trials may be different from that studied here.  \nRather than presenting our method as a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach, we hope that the \nconsiderations made in developing this design will serve as a useful model even when \nstudy details are different.   \nThe objective of the methodology described is the identification of the dose that \nis most likely to have therapeutic value.  More conventional approaches seek the \nmaximum tolerated dose, but the importance and ethics of raising doses until harm is \nobserved are doubtful if such activity occurs only well above the therapeutic range.  \nCertainly, such questions become of interest only when the proof-of-concept stage has \nbeen passed, and it is clear that the drug has potential for widespread use.  If necessary, \nthe effects of higher doses can be addressed if and when that later stage has been \nreached.  \nThe prior information for the approach will generally be derived from animal \nexperimentation and from prior human experience with similar compound. The benefits \nof the methodology will depend on the extent and reliability of this prior information. \n  \n14 \nSometimes there will be delays in processing pharmacokinetic data, so that  \nobserved AUC values are not available immediately after dosing.  The Bayesian model \ncan be updated using whatever data are available, and so can continue to be informative \ndespite missing data.  Nevertheless, every effort should be made to assemble most, if \nnot all, of the necessary data in a timely fashion.  Zhou et al. (2007) describe how this \nwas successfully achieved in their study. \nSome details of the scheme described could easily be varied.  Summary \nmeasures for pulse rate other than the maximum could be used.  For example, the \nweighted mean pulse rate (taken to be the area under the pulse rate-time curve) would \npenalise doses leading to a high pulse rate maintained over several hours, which might \nbe of more concern than the occurrence of an isolated maximum value.  Doses for the \nmotivating study could have been made up from any combination of the available \ncapsule sizes (10, 50 and 100 mg), and so more dose levels could have been created, \nand higher doses could have been made available.  The dose-escalation scheme \ndescribed in this paper does not require all available doses to be tried in turn, and so it \ncan be used with a larger set of potential doses without extending its duration.  The \nprocedure homes in on the interesting doses, and it is advantageous to provide a finer \ngrid of dose values than is conventionally done in order to identify the optimal choice \nmore accurately.    \nThe methodology described in this paper provides a framework from which the \nsafety and pharmacodynamic effects of different doses can be foreseen, together with an \nexpression of the reliability of such predictions.  The method provides a formal \nrecommendation of the doses to be used during the next dosing period, but a safety \ncommittee will usually weigh these against other information not captured by the formal \nscheme, and decide whether or not to accept the recommendation.  The modelling \nprovides more information than the final recommendation of doses, and this can be used \n  \n15 \nto help with decision making.  In applying a similar dose-escalation scheme, Zhou et al. \n(2007) report that over 70% of formal dosing recommendations were accepted for \nadministration, and that the fitted models were helpful in reaching the remaining dosing \ndecisions.     \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe authors would like to thank Eli Lilly for motivating this research and for allowing \nthe use of the data in the illustrative examples. \n \nReferences \nChevret, S.

We will now take expectations over \neach of the conditioning variables in turn, in order to \u201cunpeel\u201d the expectation of mij.  \nTaking expectations over yij, remembering that E(X\n2\n) = var(X) + {E(X)}\n2\n, we obtain \n ( ) ( ) ( )2 2 2 2ij 2 0 1 ij i 2 ij i ij i iE m | R s 2s s r= \u03b8 + \u03b8 \u03b2 + + \u03b8 \u03c3 +\u03b2 + \u03b2 + +l l l . \nNow, in a manner similar to the derivation of equation (3.5) in Whitehead et al.
