These findings \nextend recent work demonstrating that BNP levels obtained before major noncardiac \nsurgery can be used to predict peri-operative morbidity, and indicate that they also forecast \nmedium-term mortality. \n \nIntroduction \nMajor non-cardiac surgery is associated with a high risk of early cardiovascular \ncomplications.1 In addition, there is a significant longer-term mortality in these patients. \nSome of these late deaths may relate to the underlying pathology, but many are due to \ncardiovascular disease. Peri-operative and early post-operative cardiac events predict an \nexcess medium term mortality.2, 3 In particular, even small elevations in markers of \nmyocardial cell necrosis, such as cardiac troponin I (cTnI) or T, are associated with an \nincreased risk of death.2, 3  Recently, several relatively small studies have also \ndemonstrated that pre-operative levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-\nterminal pro-BNP are useful predictors of peri-operative cardiac complications in this \nsetting.4-8 These studies have, however, largely relied on subjective, short-term, end-\npoints. The aim of the current study is therefore, to determine the usefulness of pre-\noperative BNP in predicting longer-term mortality after major non-cardiac surgery, and to \n 3\n- 4 - \n   AJC-D-07-00498 \nassess whether such measures provide any additional prognostic information to that \nafforded by post-operative troponin levels.\n \nMethods \nThe study was approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent was \nobtained. Consecutive patients undergoing scheduled major non-cardiac surgery were recruited. \nThis included patients undergoing major vascular surgery, major gastrointestinal surgery and \nmajor pelvic cancer surgery. Patients requiring emergency or minor surgery were excluded. Pre-\noperative data collection included patient demographics, medical and drug history. In addition, \nthe Revised Cardiac Risk Index9 was calculated. Pre-operative blood samples were obtained for \nCardiac Troponin (cTnI) and BNP and details of surgery and anesthesia were also recorded. Post \noperative data collection included the recording of a 12 lead Electrocardiograph (ECG) and \nmeasurement of cTnI at 24 and 72 hours after surgery. Patients were followed-up while in \nhospital and subsequent vital status determined using data provided by the General Register \nOffice for Scotland. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. BNP and cTnI assays were \nmeasured using the Bayer ADVIA Centaur\u2122 immunoassay. The lower limit of detection for \nBNP is 5pg.ml-1 and the coefficients of variation at 48pg.ml-1 and 461pg.ml-1 are 3.4% and 2.9% \nrespectively.10 The 99th percentile value for the cTnI assay is 0.16\u00b5g\/L with a coefficient of \nvariation of <10% achieved at levels \u22650.32\u00b5g\/L.11\n \nCategorical data are summarised using absolute values (percentage). Normally distributed \ncontinuous data are presented as mean (standard deviation) or, where skewed, as median \n(interquartile range). Long-term survival was described using the Kaplan-Meier method and \ncomparisons made using the log-rank statistic. Estimations of risk were performed using Cox \nregression. All univariable predictors were then entered in a stepwise manner into a multivariable \n 4\n- 5 - \n   AJC-D-07-00498 \nmodel of survival, with entry and retention set at a significance level of <0.05. A receiver \noperating characteristic (ROC) curve, assessing the ability of pre-operative BNP to predict \nmortality, was plotted and the area under the curve (with 95% confidence interval) estimated. A \np-value <0.05 was considered significant. \n \nResults \nFrom September 2004 to April 2005, 239 patients eligible to take part in the study were \ninvited to participate. Twenty (8%) refused consent. It was not possible to obtain pre-operative \nblood samples from 5 patients (2%) and 10 (4%) patients did not undergo major surgery and were \nexcluded. The remaining 204 patients completed the trial protocol. Baseline characteristics for \nthis cohort are shown in table 1. Seventy (34%) patients underwent major vascular surgery, 84 \n(41%) major abdominal surgery and 50 (25%) major pelvic surgery. The utility of pre-operative \nBNP levels in predicting early cardiac events in this cohort has been previously reported.8\n \nVital status data were available for all study participants. One patient (0.5%) died within \n30 days of surgery. During a median 654 (interquartile range 532-711) days follow-up 33 patients \n(16%) died. Seventeen (24%) died after major vascular surgery, 9 (11%) after major abdominal \nsurgery and 6 (12%) after major pelvic surgery. No patients had detectable (>0.10\u00b5g\/L) cTnI \nlevels pre-operatively. In contrast, post-operative cTnI levels >0.10\u00b5g\/L at 24 and\/or 72 hours \nwere observed in 12 out of 70 (17%) patients undergoing major vascular surgery and 15 out of \n130 (12%) of those undergoing major abdominal\/pelvic surgery. Elevated cTnI levels 24 hours \nafter surgery were powerful predictors of long-term mortality. In contrast, cTnI levels at 72 hours \nwere not significant predictors. \n \n 5\n- 6 - \n   AJC-D-07-00498 \nWhen analyzed as a continuous variable, pre-operative BNP levels did not predict long-\nterm outcome. The relationship between BNP and subsequent death was not, however, linear \u2013 \nwith the excess hazard primarily associated with a pre-operative BNP level in the upper quartile \n(table 1 and figure 1). In this cohort a ROC curve identified the optimal cut-off level of BNP for \nlong-term mortality as 35pg.mL-1, which achieved a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 68%. \nThe area under the ROC curve was 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.79, p<0.001). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan \nMeier curve demonstrating survival in patients with BNP levels below and above this threshold. \n \nTo assess whether BNP levels conveyed independent prognostic information regression \nmodels were developed. In the first of these BNP dichotomised around the optimal cut-off level \nof 35pg.mL-1 was entered along with cTnI levels at 24 hours post-operatively. This demonstrated \nthat, even after correction for cTnI levels, BNP levels >35pg.mL-1 remained strong predictors of \nsubsequent death (HR 3.17, 95% CI 1.48-6.79, p=0.003). A further backward conditional model \nwas developed including BNP levels >35pg.mL-1, cTnI levels at 24 hours post-operatively, age \nand the Revised Cardiac Risk Index. In this model the only independent predictor of death was \nage (HR 1.48 per 10 year increase, 95% CI 1.04-2.12, p=0.03). However, there was a trend \ntowards BNP levels >35pg.mL-1 independently predicting outcome (HR 2.25, 95% CI 0.97-5.25, \np=0.06). \n \nDiscussion \nThe current study confirms that elevated pre-operative BNP levels in patients undergoing \nnon-cardiac surgery are associated with an increased risk of mortality during medium-term \nfollow-up. These results extend the findings from several recent small studies that have \ndemonstrated that BNP levels may be used to predict an increased risk of peri-operative adverse \nevents in this setting.4-8 In addition, the current data suggest that BNP may provide prognostic \n 6\n- 7 - \n   AJC-D-07-00498 \ninformation that is incremental to that obtained from post-operative cardiac troponin levels. It has \nalready been suggested that pre-operative BNP and\/or levels might assist in differentiating \npatients who have a very low-risk of peri-operative cardiac events from those who require more \ndetailed cardiovascular testing and optimization of therapy prior to major non-cardiac surgery.5 \nThe current data suggest this that this strategy might result in improved long-term outcome. This, \nhowever, requires to be tested prospectively. \n \nThe Revised Cardiac Risk Index9 did not prove to be a useful measure of medium-term \noutcome in this cohort. This most likely reflects the relative homogeneity of the current cohort in \nterms of their clinical risk scores. Likewise, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index was developed to \npredict peri-operative events - including clinically defined measures of morbidity, some using \noutdated definitions - and not long-term mortality. It was also derived and validated in patients \n\u226550 years old. In addition to its superior prognostic performance in this cohort, BNP levels have \nseveral other advantages. Measurement relies on a relatively cheap and widely available blood \ntest. A biochemical test also avoids the difficulties inherent in applying complex scoring systems \nand provides an objective measure without the potential for subjective interpretation.  \n \nThe current study confirms that, among patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery, \ncardiac troponin levels are frequently elevated after surgery, even in patients who are undergoing \nnon-vascular surgery. It also demonstrates that patients exhibiting only minor elevations have a \nhigher medium-term mortality. \n \nThis was a small study of patients undergoing diverse major surgical procedures. Ideally, \nthese results should be verified in a study powered to detect hospital and longer-term mortality in \nall surgical subgroups. Use of all-cause mortality has the advantage of being entirely objective. \n 7\n- 8 - \n   AJC-D-07-00498 \n We acknowledge, however, that data relating to the cause of death and other non-fatal \noutcomes would have been of interest. Further work should determine the utility of BNP in \ncombination with existing risk stratification tools and, more importantly, assess whether \ninterventions that reduce BNP levels can prevent peri-operative and longer-term complications. \n 8\n- 9 - \n   AJC-D-07-00498 \n \n1.
