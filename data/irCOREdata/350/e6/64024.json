Introduction\nElectric fields are induced in the Earth, and in conductors at or near the surface of the\nEarth, by variations in the strength and direction of the geomagnetic field. These electric\nfields drive currents called geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). GICs have been\nstudied since the mid-19th century when their effects on long distance telecommunication\ncables were first noticed. These currents can adversely affect electrical power\ntransmission grids, saturating transformers by flowing through the earthed neutral line,\nleading to possible overheating, generation of harmonics and increased reactive load. The\neffects of GICs on power transmission systems have been extensively studied in recent\nyears following the catastrophic failure of the power transmission grid in Quebec during\na severe geomagnetic disturbance on the night of 13\/14 March 1989. A description of this\nevent and subsequent work to reduce the GIC risk on the Quebec grid is given by Blais\nand Metsa (1994). Previous theoretical and experimental modelling work on GICs\nincludes that of Boteler and Pirjola (1998), Viljanen (1997), Pirjola and Viljanen (1998)\nand Viljanen and Pirjola (1994).\nDuring times of intense magnetic activity the British Isles, lying between geomagnetic\nlatitudes 53\u00b0N and 62\u00b0N, can experience strong magnetic disturbances under the\n2expanded auroral oval. The peak of the current sunspot cycle is predicted to be around the\nyear 2000 (Joselyn et al., 1997). Given that in most previous solar cycles the level of\ngeomagnetic activity increases in the three to four years following solar maximum, it is\nnow timely to examine the hazard to power transmission posed by GICs in the UK.\nThe transmission grid in England and Wales, operated by the National Grid Company\n(NGC), is connected to the Scottish grid, in which the southern part is operated by\nScottishPower and the northern part by Scottish Hydro-Electric.\nTo understand the potential problem facing power companies in the British Isles, the\nfollowing major influences on the risk posed by GICs to the transmission grid must be\nexamined:\n1. The timing, frequency and severity of geomagnetic storms (ie. climatology);\n2. Spatial variations in the resistivity structure of the British Isles and its associated\ncontinental shelf and seas;\n3. The electrical network characteristics of the transmission grid and its response to the\nsurface electric field to which it is exposed.\nThis paper examines aspects of the climatology of storms and the resistivity of the British\nIsles. We provide both a statistical overview of UK geomagnetic disturbances and also\nexamples of modelled surface electric fields that result from idealised ionospheric\nmagnetic fields. A study of the third influence - the grid response to these electric fields -\nrequires long-term, routine monitoring of GICs within the UK power network by the\nsystem operators and power companies, complemented with system studies. Although\nthere is little published data on GICs in the UK grid (see, for example, Smith, 1990) this\nis a vital component of the problem as it allows theoretical models to be tested.\nThe vector components of the geomagnetic field are measured continuously at the three\nUK geomagnetic observatories, situated at Lerwick (in Shetland), Eskdalemuir (in the\nScottish Borders) and Hartland (in Devon) \u2013 see Figure 1. Digital data are available as\none-minute mean values from 1983 onwards. There are only about half a dozen events in\nthe past two decades known to us in which GICs have been known to have a measurable\neffect, of the order of a few amps, in the UK transmission grid. In Section 2 we describe\none of these events, in which an attempt was made to measure GICs directly. From this\nanalysis a useful index of geomagnetic activity, the hourly standard deviation in the X\n(North) and Y (East) components of the geomagnetic field, is then used to characterise the\nrisk, by season and by local time. In Section 3 we outline a resistivity model of the\nBritish Isles and surrounding area which is used for estimating the surface electric fields\nthat result from varying magnetic fields. Example computations are given for magnetic\nfields polarised in the north and east directions at two different frequencies.\n32. GICs and Geomagnetic Variations in the UK\n2.1 Case study of a magnetic storm correlated with GICs\nThere is little published data concerning GICs in the British Isles. One example of GICs\nrecorded at NGC transformers on the 20 October 1989 at three locations in England and\nWales is discussed by Smith (1990). The current in the transformer neutrals was seen to\nvary from approximately +5A to -2A at Norwich Main in East Anglia, Pembroke in\nWales, and Indian Queens in Cornwall, between 1820UT and 1830UT. The GIC in the\neastern location was of opposite phase to that in the western locations. Smith (1990) also\ngives some anecdotal evidence of GIC effects during the storm of 13-14 March 1989.\nIncreased harmonic content was measured in a transformer at Harker in the north of\nEngland during a magnetic storm on 8-9 November 1991 (J. Laver, National Grid\nCompany, personal communication, 1998). A voltage dip in the Scottish grid was linked\nwith a magnetic storm on 13-14 July 1982 (South of Scotland Electricity Board\nunpublished report).\nHere we present a case study of an event identified in the Scottish part of the transmission\ngrid on 17th November 1989. ScottishPower had installed a transformer earth current\nrecorder at the Neilston 400kV substation near Paisley (R. Paton, ScottishPower plc,\npersonal communication, 1992). The data available for 17-18 November 1989 are shown\nin Figure 2a and consist of an analogue pen-chart recording of three signals and show a\nperiod of transformer earth current activity between about 1600UT and 2200UT, with a\nperiod of maximum activity in which currents reached 5A just before 1800UT (although\nthere is some doubt about the calibration of the current measurement). The currents\nvaried in positive and negative directions, and there was a further period of enhanced\nactivity around 2100UT. The location of the Neilston substation is shown in Figure 1, in\nrelation to the UK magnetic observatories.\nFigure 2b shows the instantaneous rate of change of the X (North) component of the field\nfor the two days of 17-18 November 1989, to be compared with the GIC in Figure 2a. In\nFigure 2b the three panels show the measurements made at each of the three\nobservatories. It can be seen that the maximum range in the rate of change of the X\ncomponent occurred at Eskdalemuir (the Y component behaved similarly). It was\nobserved that this storm started with a storm sudden commencement, an initial rapid\nvariation that results from enhanced current systems following the impact of a coronal\nmass ejection on the Earth's magnetosphere. Recalling that the period of GIC activity\nobserved during this time at Neilston was between 1600-2200UT with a maximum at\nabout 1800UT and a lesser maximum at about 2100UT, we can immediately see some\ncorrespondence with the variation of the rate of change of the magnetic field.\n2.2 Statistics of magnetic storms in the British Isles 1983-1998\nThis detailed example and the other events outlined above give a qualitative idea of the\nmagnitude of magnetic disturbances that may give rise to GICs in the British Isles. In\norder to quantify the occurrence of storms of this type we have examined the hourly\nstandard deviations (HSD) of the X and Y components for the years 1983 to 1998. This\nchoice of parameter is made because the instantaneous electric field does not depend\n4simply on the instantaneous rate of change of the magnetic field, but more generally on\nthe rate of change integrated over some time interval, as discussed by Cagniard (1953).\nThe maximum rate of change of the magnetic field is therefore not necessarily the best\nindicator of the size of any induced electric field. For a time series with zero mean,\nParseval's theorem equates the variance in the time domain with the integrated spectral\npower in the frequency domain. Thus the standard deviation (square root of the variance)\nin the magnetic field, over some interval in the time domain, acts as an indicator of the\ntotal magnetic spectral power during that interval. The magnetic spectral power is\nsignificant, in turn, because it affects the electric field spectrum through the\nmagnetotelluric relation (Cagniard, 1953). Alternatively, simple geomagnetic indices, the\nobservatory K indices, based on measurements of the range in the horizontal components,\nexist for various observatories in the British Isles from 1868 onwards. Boteler (1998) has\nshown that there is a high correlation between range indices and spectral power, and so\nan approximate relation can be established between K indices and spectral power.\nHowever, as one-minute digital data are available from the UK observatories, it is\nstraightforward to compute the standard deviation in the horizontal components directly.\nA time-scale of one hour is chosen here because this is similar to the duration of magnetic\nsubstorms, which are periods of intense magnetic variation at auroral latitudes, and which\ntypically last some tens of minutes to a few hours. (The time scale of the observatory K\nindices is 3 hours).\nThe HSD in the X and Y components for the Neilston case study are shown in Figures 3a\nand 3b. It is clear that the peaks in the HSD index coincide with the intervals of\nmaximum rate of change, and that these also coincide with the times of GIC activity in\nthe Neilston transformer. To examine how often this level of magnetic activity occurs in\nthe years for which digital one-minute data are available (1983 to the present) we have\nexamined how often the HSD exceeds a specified threshold value. It was decided to\nchoose a single threshold for all three observatories to highlight the latitude dependence\nof geomagnetic activity. The threshold was chosen with reference to all the known GIC\n\u2018events\u2019. An appropriate value, which was exceeded at all three UK observatories during\neach event, is 50 nT.\nTo study the number of significant events we cannot simply count the number of days on\nwhich the threshold was exceeded. This is because many magnetic storms occur over\nmidnight and may result in two days being counted even though only one magnetic storm\noccurs. Furthermore some short substorm events can exceed the threshold more than once\na day, but be separated by some hours of quieter activity. These should therefore be\nregarded as separate events. Therefore we define a \u2018GIC-type\u2019 storm as a period when\nHSD (in X or Y) exceeds the threshold of 50 nT, and storms are counted as separate if the\nHSD drops below the threshold for more than 6 hours between threshold crossings. The\nthreshold and duration criteria are applied separately for the X and Y components at each\nobservatory for the years 1983-1998. The maximum HSD for each day throughout these\nyears is plotted in Figure 4. The dates on which known GIC events were observed, as\ndiscussed above, are indicated by dashed vertical lines.\n5It will be seen from Figure 4 that HSD during a \u2018GIC-type\u2019 storm can reach several\nhundred nT. For example, the largest storm measured at Eskdalemuir occurred on 9th\nFebruary 1986, during a time of solar minimum activity, when HSD reached 473.5 nT in\nthe X component. The storms related to the few known GIC events had a peak HSD\nwhich exceeded 50 nT at all three observatories, however the peak HSD was usually\nsubstantially higher for the two northern observatories, being typically over 150 nT at\nEskdalemuir, and over 200 nT at Lerwick. However the lower threshold of 50 nT may\nremain significant in terms of degradation, that is, low-level effects integrated over time.\nIt is worth noting that although the maximum HSD is generally greater in the X\ncomponent than the Y component, there are still occasions when it can reach values of\n200 nT in the Y component. During some of the more severe storms the HSD is greater at\nEskdalemuir than Lerwick (but note that data from Lerwick were not available for the\nstorm of February 1986).\nThe number of \u2018GIC-type\u2019 storms per year in the X component of the field is shown in\nFigure 5. This shows the following important points.\n1. The 11-year solar cycle is clearly visible in the occurrence of magnetic storms. It is\nexpected that levels of activity similar to 1989-91 will be seen in the years 2000-\n2003. The double peaks in magnetic activity that have been noticed in many solar\ncycles are apparent in 1989 and 1991.\n2. The number of times the threshold is exceeded in the British Isles is clearly dependent\non latitude. As discussed previously this is due to the proximity of the auroral oval at\nhigher latitudes. During years of maximum magnetic activity there are typically ten\noccasions when the threshold is exceeded at all three observatories, and two or three\nsuch events can be expected even during years of low magnetic activity.\n3. There is a tendency for more events to occur in the X component than the Y\ncomponent, particularly at Lerwick. However the fact that there are a number of\nevents in the Y component data (e.g. Figure 4) indicates that when modelling GICs in\nthe grid it is important to consider the effects of GICs induced by magnetic fields\npolarised in arbitrary directions, rather than simply north-south or perpendicular to\nsome modelled, or \u2018average\u2019, electrojet direction.\nThe distribution of the duration of these \u2018GIC-type\u2019 storms is shown in Figure 6. Here it\ncan be seen that the majority of storms have a level of activity that exceeds the threshold\nfor less than 3 hours. There are typically only a few storms in a solar cycle which exceed\nthe threshold for more than 24 hours duration. Also of significance is the tendency for\nsevere magnetic activity to occur at a particular local time. Figure 7 shows the hour of\nday, in Universal Time, at which the peak HSD occurred. There is a clear tendency for\nactivity to occur during night-time hours, a consequence of substorm activity generated\nby magnetic reconnection in the tail of the magnetosphere.\nThere is a known tendency for magnetic activity to vary with season. In Figure 8 we\nshow the monthly occurrences of \u2018GIC-type\u2019 magnetic storms summed over the years\n61983-1997. More storms occur around March and October, which are times of the year\nwhen the average alignment of the geomagnetic field axis throughout the day is most\nfavourable for reconnection with the interplanetary magnetic field.\nThe results presented here demonstrate the climatology of magnetic storms in the British\nIsles. Taken with the few examples of GIC events measured in the grid, these results\nprovide information on when the power companies should be concerned about GICs, and\nwhich can form the basis of a monitoring service. On the basis of the limited information\navailable, typical HSD thresholds for concern are estimated to be 50 nT at Hartland, 150\nnT at Eskdalemuir and 200 nT at Lerwick. However in order to understand the generation\nof GICs in the grid in detail, which would enable modelling of the grid response to\nmagnetic storms, it is necessary to model the ground resistivity. This is addressed in the\nnext section.\n3. Modelled Surface Electric Fields in the UK\n3.1 Background to electric field modelling\nThe electric field (E-field) calculations used in GIC risk assessment typically involve the\nassumptions: (i) the earth resistivity structure varies only with depth and (ii) the E-field\nused in engineering calculations is spatially constant. The British Isles have a distinct\nresistivity structure and are surrounded by shelf-seas. The shelf-seas and deep ocean are\nknown to influence regionally induced electric fields (Beamish, 1985). The present study\nprovides an initial assessment of the limitations of assumptions (i) and (ii) when applied\nto GIC risk assessment across Britain.\nThe type of calculation performed when estimating GIC effects in a power grid is\ndescribed by Viljanen and Pirjola (1994).  Induced voltages (V) across power line\nelements (k to i) are calculated from the surface geoelectric field by a line-integral:\nVki = ?ki E.ds \u2026(1)\nCalculation of the surface E-field in (1) is undertaken using the theory of electromagnetic\ninduction. A geomagnetic variation field is taken as a source and Maxwell\u2019s equations are\nused to calculate the E-field distribution within an appropriate but finite volume of the\nEarth. In the present study a plane-wave (uniform) source field is assumed. At the low\nfrequencies of interest in GIC problems (periods of 30 minutes or less), it is the large-\nscale resistivity distribution that determines the E-field amplitudes, phases and their\nsurface distribution.\nAssuming an external plane wave source field of frequency f, the induced electric field at\nthe surface is given by the magnetotelluric relationship:\nEy(f) = [-Z(f)] Bx(f) \u2026(2)\n7Where Z(f) is the complex surface impedance and the (X, Y) electric and magnetic fields\nare orthogonal. The surface impedance is a function of frequency and the resistivity\nstructure of the subsurface. Equation (2) assumes a one-dimensional (1D) Earth\nresistivity structure; when the structure is more complex (e.g. 2D and 3D) the horizontal\nfield components are coupled and related by a 2x2 impedance tensor.\nIn magnetotelluric calculations, the skin-depth determines the appropriate scale lengths\nfor the problem. The skin-depth is defined as the depth across which the induced E-field\nis reduced in amplitude by 1\/e from the surface amplitude. In resistive terranes (say 500\nto >1000 ohm.m), the entire crustal and upper mantle environment (to a depth of several\nhundred km) will contribute to the surface response. The large scale lengths of the\ninducing fields involved in GIC effects also require that the offshore (seawater) domain\nbe considered. Seawater is highly conductive when compared to all geological materials\nand provides far greater attenuation.\nFor a given resistivity distribution, the amplitude of the surface electric field will be\nfrequency dependent. Taking a 100 ohm.m half-space as an example, the induced electric\nfield would be about 3.5 mV\/km.nT at a period of 1 minute. As the period increases to 10\nminutes, the surface amplitude would reduce by a factor of about 3. As the period further\nincreases to 30 minutes, the surface amplitude would reduce by a further factor of 2. Such\nfrequency dependent effects indicate that the choice of inducing frequency is a critical\nfactor in determining absolute magnitudes of the surface electric field. In terms of risk\nanalysis, and for identical magnitudes of inducing fields, the highest frequencies produce\nthe largest E-field amplitudes. In order to demonstrate the effect of frequency, modelling\ncalculations have been performed at inducing periods of 10 and 30 minutes.\n3.2 Development of a 3D resistivity model.\nThe geological classification of rocks bears only a tenuous relationship to their intrinsic\nresistivity. In addition, the vertical sensitivity of the E-field response for the GIC problem\nextends to depths in excess of 100 km. These two facts suggest that defining an\nappropriate 'national-scale' resistivity model is a non-trivial exercise. Some degree of\nsimplification is inevitable. For the reworked crustal material of much of Britain, an\nappropriate method is to use a tectonic base map approach. The tectonic map of Britain\n(BGS, 1996) is available digitally at 1:1.5M and includes the offshore domain, the\ncoastline and the whole of Ireland. The map defines nine orogenic terranes whose scale is\nlikely to be more appropriate to the construction of a resistivity map to crustal scale (and\ngreater) in the first instance.\nIn order to allow for electromagnetic boundary effects (see later), the resistivity model\nwas specified over an area of 1100 by 1200 km. Six major terranes were identified from\nthe tectonic map. The terranes, from north to south, included the Northern Highlands, the\nCentral Highlands, the Midland Valley, the Southern Uplands, the Concealed\nCaledonides and the Variscide terrane (see later Figure 9b). The model was developed on\nthe basis that lateral resistivity effects, both onshore and offshore were confined to the\nboundaries between the six zones. The only other lateral resistivity boundary specified\nwithin the model was that due to seawater i.e. the coastline.\n8It is important to note that skin-depths for the GIC problem indicate that it is the bulk\nconductivities, averaged vertically over tens of kilometres, to depths of several hundred\nkilometres that primarily influence the magnitude of the E-field at the surface. Localised\nperturbations may arise due to near-surface lateral resistivity contrasts but the vertical\ndistribution requires only a gross specification.\nIn the study undertaken, three vertical zones (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 km) were used to allow\nfor crustal scale resistivity variations in each of the six terranes. Below the crustal scale it\nis more appropriate (due to lack of information) to adopt a regionally representative 1D\nmodel. The most obvious sources of deep resistivity information are the results of\nmagnetotelluric (MT) surveys. Various MT studies, conducted with increasing\nsophistication largely through the 1970s and 1980s, have covered mainland Scotland and\nnorthern England (Hutton et al., 1981; Livelybrooks et al., 1993). The studies have\nidentified a variety of crustal scale resistivity zones which, importantly, have contrasts at\nthe boundaries of the terranes (e.g. the Great Glen Fault, the Highland Boundary Fault\nand the Iapetus Suture zone). To the south of the Alston Block of northern England there\nis almost a total absence of deep resistivity information. Of particular note is the absence\nof deep information on the concealed Caledonide basement. Data from two BGS surveys\nsouth of the Variscan front were used. The simplified resistivity zonation used should be\nconsidered representative rather than an actual distribution of resistivity.\nA 1D resistivity model extending from 30 to 1000 km underlies all six zones. The model\nis developed from long period observations from observatory data (Schultz and Larsen,\n1990). Both layered and smoothly-varying models may be defined; our preferred model\nis a smooth distribution in which resistivity decreases monotonically to a minimum value\nat the maximum depth (e.g. Olsen, 1998).\n3.3 Numerical modelling.\nRecent advances in 3D plane-wave modelling using finite-difference equations are\ndescribed by Mackie et al. (1993). A description of the algorithm used here is provided\nby Mackie et al. (1994). The algorithm computes the surface fields of general 3D models\nusing the minimum residual relaxation method. Model construction uses a 3D \u2018core\u2019 (in\nx, y and z) with 2D extensions (in x,z and y,z) at the edges of the core.  (Note that here x\nrepresents an east coordinate, y represents a north coordinate, which is opposite to the\nnormal convention for defining magnetic field components, used in the previous section,\nwhere X is the north component and Y is the east component.) The 3D core and 2D\nextensions are underlain by a 1D \u2018base\u2019. All three model elements are constructed using a\nstaggered grid that must conform to skin-depth requirements.\nNo single set of cell constructions can accommodate both skin-depth requirements and\nthe scale of onshore\/offshore Britain without becoming computationally unwieldy. A\n20x20 km lateral grid model of the British Isles was developed for the initial evaluations\ndescribed here. The results were obtained using a 55 by 60 cell (each 20x20 km) core\nmodel that runs from \u2013300 to 800 km (Ordnance Survey British National Grid Easting)\nand from \u2013100 to 1100 km (Northing). The coastline and tectonic zones of the digital\nmodel are shown in Figures 9a and 9b. The model is crude and obviously capable of\n9refinement. Skin depth algorithm requirements mean that a realistic sea-water resistivity\nof 0.25 ohm.m cannot be used for a 20 km lateral grid at the higher frequencies\nconsidered (600 s). A sea-water resistivity of 4 ohm.m has been used. This has only a\nmarginal effect in a 1D sense but it produces lower amplitude lateral effects at the coastal\nboundary (the resistivity contrast is lower by a factor of 16). The model results presented\nhere are for variation fields with periods of 30 and 10 minutes. The results presented use\na unitary inducing H-field boundary condition of 1 A\/m at the surface; this corresponds to\na B-field amplitude of 1257 nT. The unitary boundary condition is specified along the\nleftmost surface edge of the model where no perturbations due to lateral contrasts in\nresistivity structure occur.\nThe 2D and 3D model components extend to a depth of 30 km (i.e. the crustal scale)\nusing 8 layers. The 8 layers increase in thickness from an initial layer thickness of 200 m.\nThe initial layer was used to incorporate the average thickness of the shelf seas.  The\nmodelling is plane-wave and therefore field polarisation must be defined. The standard\nterminology of Ex polarisation indicates that a N-S magnetic oscillation (Hy) drives an E-\nW electric field. The orthogonal Ey polarisation indicates that an E-W magnetic\noscillation (Hx) drives a N-S electric field. In a 3D model, a polarised inducing field\nprovides both Ex and Ey components at resistivity boundaries; the modulus of the vector\nresultant is used for display.\n3.4 Results of numerical modelling\nA number of results for different resistivity distributions were obtained as preliminary\ninvestigations. The preliminary models included models with no coast (ie. a uniform\n200m upper layer) and with coast only (ie. no geological terranes). Such baseline models\nallow a comparison of the magnitudes of the different lateral effects across the landmass.\nElectric fields for any given linear azimuth can be obtained. The results for the Ex\npolarisation (an E-W regional electric field produced by an oscillating N-S magnetic\nfield) probably have the most relevance to the GIC problem across the British Isles. This\nis because the external electric field during storm time conditions has a strong E-W\ncomponent. In plane-wave modelling, results for other external field azimuths may be\nobtained by combining (vector addition) the fields from two orthogonal, linear\npolarisations.\nFigure 10a shows the surface electric fields obtained using the specified 3D model. The\nresults shown are for the Ex-polarisation at a period of 30 minutes. The background (i.e.\nno lateral perturbations) amplitude level is 653 mV\/km (offshore) and 670 mV\/km\n(onshore). The maximum and minimum values in Figure 10a are 2212 and 14 mV\/km\nrespectively. The main perturbations to the induced E-field are clearly caused by the\ncoast effect. E-field magnitudes are reduced offshore and enhanced onshore with respect\nto background (1D) levels. The shallow (coastal boundary) effects are large and localised\nwhile crustal scale resistivity contrasts produce smaller amplitude but larger scale effects.\nThe largest effects produced by the tectonic terrane model occur where the model has the\nhighest resistivity contrast (the NW of Scotland).\n10\nThe results for the same model and polarisation at an inducing period of 10 minutes\ndisplay a similar distribution to those of Figure 10a. Due to the higher frequency\nhowever, the background amplitude level increases to 1309 mV\/km (offshore) and 1345\nmV\/km (onshore). Localised high amplitude effects again occur onshore and exceed 4000\nmV\/km. Field polarisation can play a significant role in the distribution of induced fields.\nFigure 10b shows the results for the Ey polarisation at a period of 10 minutes. Maximum\nand minimum values are 4395 and 87 mV\/km respectively.\nThe precise effects of the high value assigned to the sea water resistivity would be best\nestimated in future 3D modelling by decreasing the cell sizes and increasing the number\nof cells. Typical computation times for such models would remain modest (less than 1\nhour). Although the main focus here has been the estimation of surface E-fields for the\nengineering calculation (equation 1), the modelling results can be compared with field\nobservations to test their validity. The behaviour of low frequency induction vectors\n(vertical to horizontal magnetic field ratios) offer a means of summarising the integrated\neffects of the induced currents from both polarisations of the inducing field. Induction\nvectors are defined by their amplitude, phase and azimuth. Real induction vector\nmagnitudes (GR in the notation of Beamish, 1985) calculated for a period of 10 minutes\nare shown in Figure 11. The diagram shows the contoured magnitudes, expressed as a\npercentage, together with the real induction arrows that point towards excess\nconcentrations of current caused by lateral resistivity contrasts. Amplitude is also\nincorporated into the size of the arrows; the maximum arrow size is 4.5%. In the south\nand south-east, where no crustal scale resistivity contrasts are defined in the model, a\nsimple coast-effect behaviour is observed. The high contrast tectonic terrane boundaries\nin Scotland produce the largest induction vectors and provide some complex rotation\npatterns. Equivalent observations of induction vectors across the British Isles, although\nsparse, are presented by Beamish (1985) for a frequency range then encompasses that of\nthe present modelling study. The observations indicate that real induction vector\nmagnitudes should reach (typically) minimum values of between 10% and 20%. The\nlargest observed magnitude in Figure 11 is only 4.5%. The comparison suggests that the\nmodel parameters used, do not generate sufficient excess concentrations of current in\nboth geological and coastline contexts.\n4. Conclusions\nFrom the results presented here we can draw some general conclusions:\n1. Magnetic storms exceeding an HSD threshold of 50 nT at all three UK magnetic\nobservatories may occur up to 10 times a year in years of maximum magnetic\nactivity, and may still occur during years of low magnetic activity.\n2. Geomagnetic disturbances that may give rise to GICs in the UK power grid tend to\noccur in the night-time hours. There is also a tendency for a greater occurrence of\nhigh activity in March and October. This is consistent with the behaviour of more\n\u2018traditional\u2019 geomagnetic indices such as Ap and aa. Most periods of significant\nmagnetic activity last less than 3 hours.\n11\n3. The study has discussed the behaviour of the horizontal E-field induced across the\nBritish Isles by external geomagnetic variation fields. It has been pointed out that, for\nthe same inducing field magnitude, the highest frequencies produce the largest\nsurface E-fields and therefore provide the highest risk in terms of induced GIC\namplitudes. At the frequencies appropriate to the GIC problem, it is the deep (> 30\nkm) upper mantle resistivity distribution that largely determines the amplitude level\nof the surface fields. Both of these statements are strictly applicable to a resistivity\ndistribution that varies only with depth. Such a distribution is unrealistic.\n4. When lateral resistivity gradients are considered, currents are generated which\nprovide a redistribution of the amplitude and phase of the surface electric fields. The\nresults of the modelling presented here demonstrate the spatial complexity that may\nbe expected in the GIC problem across the British Isles. Onshore enhancement by\nfactors of between 2 and 4 in the induced electric field are a pervasive feature. The\nfields are not spatially uniform particularly for grid elements at coastal locations. In\norder to implement preliminary but accurate 3D modelling, the resistivity of seawater\nhas been taken to be a factor of 16 above the realistic value (0.25 ohm.m). The\nprecise effects of the high value assigned to the sea water resistivity would be best\nestimated in future 3D modelling by decreasing the cell sizes and increasing the\nnumber of cells.\nIn order to improve both the modelling and monitoring aspects two further developments\ncan be considered (both of which may make direct use of data from the UK magnetic\nobservatories):\n1. There needs to be a more systematic, long-term monitoring of GICs in the neutral line\nof UK power transformers, especially at coastal sites. Comparison with theoretical\nmodels of GICs may lead to improvements in electric field and network current\nmodels and may improve the likelihood of accurate real-time monitoring and\nforecasting.\n2. Improved electrojet models, e.g. the models of Boteler and Pirjola (1998) and Pirjola\nand Viljanen (1998), are important for a more physically realistic surface electric\nfield model leading to, again, accurate modelling of network currents and potentials.\nFinally, we note that the coastal effect may have implications beyond the power industry,\nfor example, for pipeline operations at coastal sites around the world at near-auroral\nlatitudes.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Grid Company, and we are grateful for useful\ndiscussions with ScottishPower.
