Both the carrier lifetime and the PL intensity\ndecrease with increasing doping. These trends are explained\nby increasing Auger recombination, although this increase is\nweaker than in higher dimensional systems.\nSelf-assembled InAs QDs were grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy on GaAs substrates. The QDs were grown\nwithin 8 nm In0.15Ga0.85As\u2013GaAs quantum wells \u0001QWs\u0002 to\ngive a dot-in-a-well \u0001DWELL\u0002 structure.11,12 Five samples\nwith undoped QDs \u0001QDU\u0002 and 6 \u0001QDH6\u0002, 12 \u0001QDH12\u0002, 18\n\u0001QDH18\u0002, and 30 \u0001QDH30\u0002 acceptors\/QD were studied.\nQDU and QDH30 have six QD layers; the other samples\nhave seven layers. The thicknesses of the GaAs spacer layer\nbetween the DWELLs were 45 nm for QDU and QDH30 and\n50 nm for the other structures. Within the spacer layers\n6-nm-thick Be doped regions were placed 9 nm below each\nDWELL.\nThe 10 K PL emission wavelengths are 1211, 1190,\n1193, 1191, and 1209 nm for samples QDU, QDH6, QDH12,\nQDH18, and QDH30, respectively. These very similar wave-\nlengths indicate that the physical structure of the QDs is not\nsignificantly affected by the doping. The room temperature\nemission of all samples is close to 1.3 \u0001m, with a strong\nintegrated PL intensity, decreasing by no more than 75%\ncompared to the respective low temperature value, confirm-\ning a high structural quality.\nTime-resolved PL \u0001TR-PL\u0002 was performed at 10 K using\na mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser with a repetition rate of 76\nMHz and a pulse width of \u0005180 fs. The excitation wave-\nlength was 740 nm, which excites carriers above the GaAs\nband edge. Transient PL signals were detected for a 10 nm\nband centered at the peak of the ground state emission by a\nstreak camera. The system resolution was 76 ps.\nFigure 1 shows the 10 K PL decay transients for all five\nsamples. The excitation power density was 0.74 W \/cm2,\nlow enough to excite only emission from the ground state\ntransition. The extracted carrier lifetimes are 1240, 710, 460,\n410, and 350 ps for QDU, QDH6, QDH12, QDH18, and\nQDH30, respectively. The decay time hence decreases\nmonotonically with increasing doping level.\nFigure 2 plots the doping dependence of the integrated\nPL intensity relative to that of QDU for different excitation\nwavelengths.

Data are also shown for excitation into the wetting layer\n\u0001inverted triangles\u0002 and directly into the QDs \u0001diamonds\u0002.\nAlthough there is some scatter in the data, most likely due to\nerrors associated with determining absolute PL intensities, a\ndecreasing intensity with increasing doping level is clearly\nseen. In addition, this decrease is independent of the excita-\ntion wavelength, indicating that any nonradiative processes\nmust involve carriers within the QDs and does not occur as\ncarriers migrate to, or are captured into, the dots. Figure 2\nsuggests a saturation of the intensity falloff for doping levels\nabove \u000518 acceptors\/QD. This is discussed further below.\nWe attribute both the reduction in the PL intensity and\nthe decrease in the decay time with increasing doping to\nenhanced Auger nonradiative recombination resulting from\nthe extrinsic holes. The PL intensity \u0001IPL\u0002 is given by\nIPL =\nNeh\n\u0002r\n= \u0006 \u0002Aug\n\u0002r + \u0002Aug\n\u0007G , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0002r and \u0002Aug represent the radiative and Auger recom-\nbination times, respectively, G is the optical carrier genera-\ntion rate, and Neh is the density of electron-hole pairs. For\nsystems with continuous energy states, e.g., bulk and QWs,\nthe Auger recombination rate \u0001RAug\u0002 can be written as\nRAug =\nN\n\u0002Aug\n= CnN2P + CpNP2, \u00012\u0002\nallowing an effective Auger rate in a p-doped system to be\napproximated as 1 \/\u0002Aug\bCpP2, where CP and P \u0001N\u0002 are the\nAuger coefficient and hole \u0001electron\u0002 density, respectively.\nBecause of their discrete energy levels, the dependence of\nthe Auger recombination rate on hole density in QDs is ex-\npected to be weaker than for bulk and QWs. Although all\nholes confined within the QD can be excited to higher states\nduring the Auger process, selection rules allow only holes in\nthe ground state \u0001a maximum of two\u0002 to recombine strongly\nwith the photoexcited electron in the conduction band\nground state. For very strong \u0003n=0 selection rules only the\nground state holes can recombine with the electron and\n1 \/\u0002Aug\bCpP. Calculations for realistic dot shapes indicate\nthat while some \u0003n\u00030 transitions are allowed, these are\nmuch weaker that the \u0003n=0 ones.13 Hence the dependence\nof the Auger recombination rate on doping density is ex-\npected to be slightly stronger than linear. In the following\nanalysis the Auger recombination rate is set to 1 \/\u0002Aug\n\bCpPn, with the exponent \u0001n\u0002 determined from a fitting to\nthe experimental data.\nThe hole density per QD is divided into contributions\nfrom the optically generated carriers, \u0003p, and the doping,\n\u0003pe, with Pn= \u0001\u0003p+\u0003pe\u0002n. Here it is assumed that \u0003p equals\n1, a result of the low excitation power used for the lifetime\nmeasurements, and \u0003pe varies from 0 to 30. The quantum\nefficiency of the undoped QDs is assumed to be 100%; hence\nthe PL intensity of these dots equals G. When the Auger\nlifetime is inserted into Eq. \u00011\u0002, this equation can be rewrit-\nten as\nIPL \b\nIPL\nundoped\n1 + \u0002rCp\u00011 + \u0003pe\u0002n\n. \u00013\u0002\nEquation \u00013\u0002 predicts a decreasing PL intensity \u0001IPL\u0002 with\nincreasing doping level. In addition, the PL decay time \u0001\u0002\u0002\nwill also decrease with increasing \u0003pe since this is given by\n1 \/\u0002=1 \/\u0002r+1 \/\u0002Aug.\nFigure 3 shows a fit to the lifetime data using Eq. \u00013\u0002.\nThese data are chosen for analysis rather than the intensity\ndata as they are less susceptible to experimental errors. Solid\ncircles represent the doped:undoped lifetime ratios, with life-\ntimes determined from the decay transients being accurate to\na few picoseconds. The solid line \u0001fit 1\u0002 is the fit to all the\ndata points. However, both the lifetime data and the intensity\ndata suggest a saturation for doping levels above \u000518\nacceptors\/QD and this may reflect a limit to the number of\nholes that can be accommodated by a QD. The above analy-\nsis has assumed that the number of holes in each QD to be\nequal to that provided by the doping. This is a reasonable\nassumption for low doping levels but will break down at\nhigh levels when the electrostatic energy of the QD shifts the\nconfined hole states above the GaAs valence band edge. To\naccount for this possible saturation, a fit has also been per-\nformed to just the 0\u201318 acceptors\/QD data. This is shown in\nFig. 3 by the dashed line \u0001fit 2\u0002. Both fits give similar param-\neters, indicating that despite uncertainties in the number of\nholes\/QD, relatively reliable parameters can be extracted.\nValues obtained for the exponent \u0001n\u0002 and Auger coefficient\n\u0001Cp\u0002 are 1.1\u00040.2 and \u00016\u00044\u0002\u000510\u22125 ps\u22121 for fit 1 and\n1.3\u00040.3 and \u00014\u00043\u0002\u000510\u22125 ps\u22121 for fit 2.14 As expected n is\nclose to 1, consistent with strong selection rules between the\ndiscrete QD states. The Auger coefficient can be converted to\neffective two dimensional or three-dimensional \u00013D\u0002 values\nby using appropriate QD dimensions, with values of\nCp\n2D\n= \u00013.8\u00042.5\u0002\u000510\u221214 cm4 \/s and Cp\n3D\n= \u00013.4\u00042.3\u0002\n\u000510\u221227 cm6 \/s obtained for fit 1.

In\naddition, the Auger coefficient and radiative recombination\nrate are expected to depend strongly on the dot parameters.13\nDefect-related nonradiative recombination could also de-\ncrease both the PL life time and efficiency, although from the\nobservation of the wavelength independent relative intensi-\nties \u0001Fig. 2\u0002 these defects would have to be either in, or very\nclose to, the QDs.17 Significant defect-related recombination\nshould result in a superlinearity of the PL intensity with ex-\ncitation power density.18 However a linear dependence, with\nan exponent very close to 1, is found for all samples over the\nexcitation power density range of 0.1\u2013100 W \/cm2. Over\nthis range the photogenerated electron-hole density remains\nbelow 1 per QD and hence the Auger rate is expected to\nremain constant. This observed linear dependence therefore\nindicates that defect-related nonradiative carrier recombina-\ntion from the ground state of the QDs does not contribute\nsignificantly to the reduction in the PL intensity and decay\ntime.\nIn conclusion, the doping dependence of the low tem-\nperature carrier recombination time in p-type modulation\ndoped QDs has been investigated. The carrier decay time\ndecreases with increasing doping level. This behavior is at-\ntributed to an enhancement of the Auger-type recombination\nrate by the extrinsic holes. A weaker dependence on hole\ndensity is found in comparison to bulk and QWs, a result of\nstrong selection rules for transitions between the discrete QD\nstates.\nThis work was supported by the Korea Research Foun-\ndation grant funded by the Korean Government \u0001MOEHRD\u0002\n\u0001Grant No. KRF-2006-352-C00016\u0002, the UK Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council, and the European\nCommission Network of Excellence SANDiE.
