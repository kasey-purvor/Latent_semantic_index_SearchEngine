Moreover, the food shortages in the UK that\nwere experienced during World War II gave the first\nopportunity to show that nutritional science could make a\nvaluable contribution to public policy. However, public\nhealth nutrition is now facing the challenge of deriving\nrecommendations based on systematically evaluated\nevidence; that is, the new concept of evidence-based\nnutrition. This challenge was foreseen by John Garrow\nalmost 10 years ago in his lucid editorial proposing the\nformation of meta-analysis \u2018clubs\u20191.\nThe 2000 Eurodiet Conference was the culmination of a\ntwo-year EU-wide scientific process funded by the\nEuropean Commission, which ended with a set of\npopulation dietary goals2. These recommendations were\nintended to provide the basis for future EU-wide nutrition\naction. However, they have only been partly adopted. A\nCouncil Resolution on health and nutrition has cited\nincreased fruit and vegetable consumption and increased\nbreast-feeding as possible priorities for European nutrition\npolicy (Council of Ministers\u2019 resolution, 14 December\n2000), but other recommendations, such as those on total\nfat and saturated fatty acids, iron, sodium, potassium and\ncalcium, have yet to reach even this tentative recognition.\nOne of the reasons for this hesitancy can be found in the\nclosing speeches of the Eurodiet conference, when Matti\nRajala, from the Directorate General, asked for nutritional\nevidence to be assembled in a more transparent and\naccessible way. Rajala observed that the conference had\nbeen debating what evidence should be cited, and he\ndoubted that all of the relevant studies had been\nconsidered. He pointed to the absence of systematically\ncollated evidence to support recommendations, and called\nfor less reliance on consensus documents, and more\nreliance on systematic accumulation, synthesis and\npresentation of evidence. In summary, he was calling for\nmore evidence-based nutrition.\nA definition of evidence-based nutrition can be derived\nvery simply from one well-known definition of evidence-\nbased public health3. Evidence-based nutrition is the\napplication of the best available systematically assembled\nevidence in setting nutrition policy and practice. The need\nfor new methods of dealing with published data is clear\nfrom Fig. 1. The amount of published work is increasing\nrapidly, and is quite beyond any one person to handle\nrationally. Systematic methods to synthesise information\nare available and there is an urgent need to use them more\nwidely.\nThe methods are already being applied in nutrition4\u20137.\nThe Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy\u2019s\n(COMA) recent review of nutrition and cancer8 is the first\ngovernment report to use this approach to summarising\nevidence. Well-conducted and clearly reported systematic\nreviews are invaluable in clarifying complicated or\ncontentious issues, and sometimes the results challenge\nexisting wisdom. A recent pooled analysis of eight\nprospective studies of breast cancer and fruit and\nvegetable intake, involving more than 350 000 women,\ndid not find a link between the two9. This is an important\nresult, given the \u2018probable\u2019 protective effect reported in a\nprevious high-profile review10.\nEvidence-based nutrition has found a place in the\nCochrane Library. The most recent edition of the Cochrane\nq The Authors 2001*Corresponding author: Email e.brunner@ucl.ac.uk\nPublic Health Nutrition: 4(6), 1297\u20131299 DOI: 10.1079\/PHN2001272\nLibrary11 contains 60 complete reviews involving one\nor more nutritional interventions. However, the model\nof a Cochrane Review, which is typically a meta-\nanalysis of randomised controlled trials, does not\ntranslate comfortably into the field of nutrition.\nIdentifying effective interventions in nutrition often\nrequires studying diet over longer periods and in\nlarger populations than would ever be practical in a\nrandomised controlled trial, even supposing partici-\npants could be found who would agree to long-term\nengineering of their dietary intake.\nMoreover, the scope of evidence-based nutrition is far\nwider than randomised trials. To construct effective and\nrelevant policy recommendations, evidence is certainly\nneeded on the relationship between diet and health but\nevidence is also needed on the acceptability of foods, on\nefficiency of food distribution, on the psychological or\nsocial issues that affect food preference, and so on. The\nevidence that will be used will come from observational\nstudies, from economic modelling exercises, from\nsociological studies and from many other sources, as\nwell as from randomised controlled trials. What is\nimportant is that evidence is assembled systematically,\nwith transparent inclusion and exclusion criteria, with\nattention paid to the methodological quality of the work,\nand without prior assumptions about the findings being\nallowed to influence what evidence is considered. The key\nprinciples of systematic reviews are summarised in the\nAppendix.\nThe COMA working group8 reviewing links between\nnutrition and cancer drew heavily on earlier work of the\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)12.\nThe vast majority of studies reviewed were either case\u2013\ncontrol or cohort studies; there were few randomised\ncontrolled trials. When all available literature was\ncompiled, deliberations about drawing conclusions from\nthe data were based upon: the type of epidemiological\nstudy; consistency of results between studies; the quality\nof studies reviewed (using a scoring system13); a general\ntendency for the results of all studies to be in the same\ndirection; the size of the relative risk; whether there was a\ngraded response; evidence of an effect from randomised\ncontrolled trials; evidence of the exposure preceding the\neffect; and whether there was any evidence of a plausible\nmechanism. In the end the conclusions reached were still\nmatters of judgement, but at least the evidence had been\nlaid out in a clear, open and transparent way, and all the\nevidence was judged in the same way.\nA commitment to evidence-based nutrition will require\nshifting the focus of debate from sterile dissent about what\nevidence is relevant to working together to explain\nheterogeneity in the evidence. The \u2018latest study supports\nmy view\u2019 approach to knowledge is seriously weakened\nby systematic review principles.\nConverting evidence to policy is a difficult process, and\nthis is particularly true of setting population nutrition\ngoals, as the Eurodiet participants found. The continuing\ndebates about the efficacy and effectiveness of recommen-\ndations on dietary fat and fat fractions, salt, extrinsic sugar\nand various micronutrients will only move forward\nproductively if an evidence-based approach is adopted.\nHowever, evidence-based nutrition is not a panacea.\nVested interests inevitably influence debates in nutrition,\nand will continue to do so. Furthermore, data are not\navailable in equivalent quantity or quality for all types of\ndecisions. There is far more evidence related to\ninterventions at individual level than at population level,\nand this imbalance may distort policy-making. (This, once\nagain, highlights the importance of a broad-based\napproach to the type of evidence included in systematic\nreviews.)\nMoving towards evidence-based nutrition\nHow could evidence-based nutrition be promoted?\nNutritionists need systematic review skills, particularly in\ncritical appraisal, database searching and quantitative\nmethods. Departments of nutrition and others with a\nresearch interest in the nutrition field must alter the\nemphasis in their undergraduate and postgraduate\ncourses, and add data synthesis to their research\nportfolios, for example through doctoral projects. We\npropose that a European network be established that\nbrings nutritionists together with epidemiologists, biosta-\ntisticians and other relevant specialists. A series of\ninternational workshops on evidence-based nutrition\ncould be a major contribution of the proposed network.\nThere are many models for a collaborative review\nnetwork in nutrition. Defining its tasks and methods will\nrequire discussion, but the potential outputs of such a\nnetwork are exciting. A library of reviews in a standard\nformat on CD-ROM and the Internet would be central.\nQuestions of methodology, aetiology, efficacy and\neffectiveness are all suitable for systematic review.\nFig. 1 Medline citations of papers including nutritional items by\npublication year\nE Brunner et al.1298\nConclusion\nPublic Health Nutrition will be revitalised by systematic,\nevidence-based methods that will deliver clarity of\nevidence and effective policy recommendations, thereby\nproducing public health gains. Public Health Nutrition can\nhave the impact it deserves, but only if the evidence is\nbrought together and applied to the solution of real\nproblems.\nStatement of interest\nEB and LH are unpaid editors in the Cochrane Heart\nGroup.\nReferences\n1 Garrow JS.
