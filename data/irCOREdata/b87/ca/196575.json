Thixoforging involves shaping alloys with a globular microstructure in the semi-solid \nstate. To reach this kind of material, the Recrystallisation and Partial Melting (RAP) process can be \nused to obtain a globular microstructure from extruded material with liquid penetrating the \nrecrystallised boundaries. Induction heating is used to apply the RAP process to slugs. One of the \nbenefits of using this method of heating is the fast heating rate (20\u00b0C\/s). This paper will help to \nimprove heating parameters by showing their influence on 7075 aluminium alloy recrystallisation. \nThese parameters are the heating rate; heating frequencies-power; presence or not of protective gas; \nposition of the slug in the inductor; energy stored inside the slug; oxide layer on the slug side; \nchamfer of the slug upper corner. \nIntroduction \nThixoforging process. Thixoforming is a semisolid metal processing route (SSM), which \ninvolves forming of alloys in the semisolid state to near net shaped products [1]. For this to be \npossible, the microstructure of the semisolid must consist of globular solid grains surrounded by a \nliquid matrix. It will then behave thixotropically: if it is sheared, the viscosity falls and it flows like \na liquid, but if allowed to stand it thickens again. Thixoforging is thixoforming process at high solid \nfraction. With such a process, parts are shaped in one step and their mechanical properties are near \nthose from forging process with complex geometry possibilities [2]. \nMaterial. The required microstructure can be obtained by several routes. In the present work, \nalloy 7075 (Al \u2013 (5.1-6.1)Zn \u2013 (2.1-2.9)Mg \u2013 (1.2-2.0)Cu \u2013 0.5Fe \u2013 0.4Si \u2013 (0.18-0.28)Cr -0.3Mn \u2013 \n0.2Ti, all composition in wt-% unless otherwise stated [3]) supplied by ??? is studied. The 7075 \naluminium alloy is a wrought alloy that shows, by DSC analysis, a less sensitive solid fraction to \ntemperature variation at high solid fraction (Fig. 1); this is why we are going to focus here on a solid \nstate route to obtain small solid globular grains surrounded by a liquid matrix. This solid state route \nis the recrystallisation and partial melting route \n(RAP) [4]. \nFirstly, the material is warm worked e.g. by \nextrusion. The extrusion has taken place below \nthe recrystallisation temperature and the starting \nmaterial for this work has the long, thin grains, \ntypical of an extruded microstructure. Secondly, \non reheating into the semisolid state, \nrecrystallisation occurs and the liquid penetrates \nthe recrystallised boundaries so resulting in \nspheroids surrounded by liquid. There are two \nmain advantages of this solid state route. Firstly, \nsome alloys are supplied in the extruded state (i.e. worked) in any case. Secondly, the spheroids are \nFig. 1: Solid fraction vs. temperature obtained by \nDSC analysis at a heating rate of 15\u00b0C\/min \n \n \n \nmore fully rounded than those from, for example, the standard commercial route to spheroidal \nmicrostructures, like magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stirring. The main disadvantages are that there \nmay be variation in the amount of stored work across the section, resulting in inhomogeneity, and \nextrusion can be difficult and expensive with wider slug1\nExperiences \n diameters [5]. In the RAP process, some \nheating parameters have to be optimised to reduce time for industrial application while keeping in \nmind the quality of parts. Effects of these parameter variations on the microstructure are observed.  \nInductive heating is used to apply the RAP process to a slug placed \non a ceramic pedestal at room temperature. The seven heating \nparameters we focus on are: heating rate; heating frequency-power; \nposition of the slug in the inductor; the presence, or not, of protective \ngas; energy stored in the slug; oxide layer on the side of the slug and \nchamfer. Their effects on the recrystallisation are described. To check \nthese influences, a 150 kW generator with frequencies from 2 kHz to \n10 kHz is used with a paraboloic inductor, shown in figure 2, to reach \nhomogeneous temperature from the bottom to the top of the slug \nduring heating. \nHeating rate. Heating cycle length is an important parameter for \nindustrial application. In this goal, two heating cycles with different \nlengths, reaching 600\u00b0C, are compared from the point of view of \ndifferent energies and recrystallisation. These heating cycles reach the \nfinal temperature relatively slowly to let kinetic transformations, like \nsolid to liquid, occur. Microstructures of slugs heated with these two \nheating cycles are compared. For the next set of experiments, a short \nimproved heating cycle is then used. \nHeating frequency\/power. Two heating cycles, having different frequencies and showing the \nsame evolution of temperature by modifying the power, are tested. The frequencies tested are the \nlowest one on our 150 kW generator, 2,3 kHz, and a higher one using maximal power for the first \nstep: 5,4 kHz. For the slug, using different frequencies means different penetrations. \nRecrystallisation is studied for each heating cycle. For this, three samples from each heating cycle at \ndifferent frequencies are cut to observe microstructure. For the other experiments, low frequency is \nused. \nPosition. It\u2019s quite hard to build an inductor where the centre corresponds to the electomagnetic \nfield axis (EMFA). So on our device, the EMFA is not in the centre of the inductor, and the power \nis so high at the beginning of the heating cycle that, due to the light weight of aluminium, the slug \nmoves against the cement that protects the coils of the inductor. There is an energy loss by \nconduction that could affect the recrystallisation of the slug. Three slugs (30 mm diameter, 59 mm \nlength) not centred in the inductor are heated in the same condition. Slugs are cut in quarters: \nmicrostructure in contact with the cement is observed. The side of the slugs is examined to note any \ndifferences in recrystallisation.  \nProtective gas. To observe the influence of protective gas on the recrystallisation at the side \nsurface of the slug, different pressures of argon are tested: 3 bars, 1 bar and no argon (0 bar i.e. air). \nThe heating cycle has to be modified to compensate the loss by convection due to the gas. The side \nof the slugs is observed to note any differences in recrystallisation.  \nEnergy stored. During rolling of the feedstock, friction on the side of the extruded bar creates \nheat that could decrease energy stored in these areas and affect recrystallisation during heating to \n                                                          \n1 Small cylinder cut from extruded bar. \nFig. 2 : Inductor dimensions \nin [mm] \n \n \n \nsemisolid state [5]. To avoid influence of other parameters, the oxide layer on extruded bar is \nremoved by machining 0,2 mm, no argon is used and the position of the slug during heating is in the \ncentre of the inductor. A slug of 59 mm length is cut from a 35 mm diameter 7075 extruded bar. \nThe side of the slugs is examined to note any \ndifferences in recrystallisation.  \nChamfer. Influence of chamfer on the slug \nupper corner, in relation to homogeneity of \nthe solid fraction in this area, is studied. A \nslug with chamfer and another without are \nheated in the same conditions. The solid \nfraction homogeneity is observed on the \nmicrostructure of the slug in the upper corner. \nResults and Discussion \nHeating rate. Two different heating \ncycle lengths and the corresponding \npowers, reaching 600\u00b0C, are shown on figure 3. It \nis difficult to reach smoothly the final temperature \nbecause our generator can only give steps in \nlevels of power (Fig. 4). The sensibility of the \npower applied on the slug is about 0,1 kW. \nThe comparison between microstructures from \neach cycle is shown in figure 5. Grain size, shape \nand solid fraction are the same for both cycles. \nBut some non recrystallized grains remain for \nshort cycle on the \naxis of the slug due to the low energy stored in the axis \nduring extrusion. We will observe influence of these \nelongated grains on thixoforged parts [6].  \nFrom an energy point of view, a short heating cycle \nof 145 s consumes 8% more than the longer one at 415 s  \nin reaching the same temperature (Fig. 3) because of \nthe power transmission saturation to the slug.  \nIf a protective atmosphere is used \nduring heating, the possibility of \nreducing heating cycle length is \ninteresting from a cost point of \nview. \nHeating frequency\/power. Two \nheating cycles at different \nfrequencies (2,3 kHz and 5,4 kHz) \nshowing the same evolution of \ntemperature (Fig. 6)  \nby modifying heating power are \ntested. \nIt is difficult to have the same \ntemperature evolution at two \ndifferent frequencies because of the \nFig. 4: Power levels given by our generator (Can you give a larger point size so the diagram is clearer??? \nFig. 3: Different heating cycles lengths with corresponding power cycles (Need to \nexplain more clearly) \nFig. 5: Microstructures etched in Keller reagent of \nslugs heated with cycle from figure 3: a) short \ncycle; b) long cycle  \nFig. 6: Temperature evolution from two heating cycles having different \nfrequencies using different powers \n \n \n \ndifference in power efficiency between low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF). First, we \nnotice on figure 6 that the power at LF starts with a delay of 1,5 second (this isn\u2019t clear in the \ndiagram\u2026.). On the same figure, the \ntemperature in the slug is more homogeneous \nduring heating for LF than for HF. The HF \noverall power used to heat the slug, is lower than \nthe LF one. For the first power step, the LF \npower, where the efficiency on our device is 8% \nis twice as efficient as for the HF power (4%) \nbecause of the power transmission saturation to \nthe slug. So it is advantageous for homogeneous \ntemperature and cost saving to use LF.  \nTo calculate the penetration for different \nfrequencies, the next formula is used [7]: \np\u00b2=\u03c1\/(\u03c0*\u03bc0*\u03bcr*f) where p is the penetration in [m], \n\u03c1 is the electric resistivity in [\u03a9*m], \u03bc0 is the \nvacuum permeability in \n[H\/m], \u03bcr is the relative \npermeability, f is the \nfrequency in [Hz]: \n\u2022 pLF = 1,72 mm \nfor LF heating; \n\u2022 pHF = 1,12 mm \nfor HF heating. \nThe difference between \npenetration distance for LF \nand HF is 0,6 mm.  \nThe comparison \nbetween microstructures of \nslug side from each cycle is \nshown on figure 7. All \ngrains have the same size and shape. There is no transition around the limit of the penetration \ndistance from recrystallised grains point of view because of the conduction. There is no difference \nin recrystallisation on the slug side \nbetween grains heated at HF and \nthose heated at LF because they \nare heated at the same power \n(Fig. 6) but on different \nthickness. \nPosition. There is no \ndifference about microstructures \nfrom recrystallisation point of \nview. If the slug touches the \ncement of the inductor, the \ncontact is so small that little heat \nis lost to modify the \nrecrystallisation. Ensuring the inductor diameter is matched to the slug diameter:  \n\u2022 increases efficiency and homogeneity of the temperature in the slug during heating;  \nFig. 7: Microstructures etched in Keller reagent from \nslugs heated at two different frequencies with cycles \nshown on figure 6  \nFig. 8: Heating cycles used for different pressures of argon: 3, 1 or 0 bars \nfor two diameters: D30mm or D35mm  \nFig. 9: Microstructures etched in Keller reagent from slugs D30mm heated \nwith cycles shown on figure 8 at different argon pressures : a) 3 bars, b) 1 \nbar, c) no argon (0 bar) \n \n \n \n\u2022 limits the displacement of the slug during \nheating at high power. \nProtective gas. The convection between the argon and \nthe slug means that the heating power cycle has to be \nmodified to achieve the same temperature evolution (Fig. \n8).  \nThe comparison of microstructures shows, in figure 9, \nthat there is a zone of large grains at the side of the \nspecimen for higher argon pressure and this hardly exists \nfor 0 bar (no argon). These large grains have the same \ncomposition as globular grains inside the slug (Table 1). No oxide layer is observed on \nmicrostructure (although a very thin layer may be present). \nA benefit of gas is that it assists in rapidly achieving a homogeneous temperature distribution \nbetween the centre and the side of the slug. Another positive point is that, at high temperature (over \n615\u00b0C), the gas helps to maintain the shape of the slug, avoiding runoff due to gravity.  \nEnergy stored. Figure 10 shows the transition between the machined side length where the \noxide layer has been removed and the non-machined region (***Need to label on the micrograph). \nThere is little difference between the two regions. There is however a layer about 1 mm in from the \nsurface where some elongated grains are still present. These grains might interfere with flow in \nthixoforming. If this was found to be the case, this could be avoided by machining a layer 2mm \nthick from the surface.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChamfer. No solid fraction variation is observed \nin the upper side corner due to the right angle (Fig. \n11). It is not therefore necessary to machine a \nchamfer on the top corner of the slugs (as is argued \nby some researchers) for the temperatures used here (600\u00b0C). \nConclusions \nIn the RAP process, some parameters have to be optimised to reduce time for heating into the \nsemi-solid state while keeping in mind the quality of parts. Influences of heating parameters on \nrecrystallisation have been observed. To observe these influences, we had to apply the same \ntemperature evolution to slugs in different conditions sometimes by modifying power levels: \n\u2022 Heating cycle length is reduced to 145 s by increasing heating rate to 20\u00b0C\/s for the first \npower step. There are no major impacts on the microstructure (grain size, shape or solid \nfraction). A few unrecrystallised grain remain but their resistance to the material flow \nin [Wt%] Al Zn Mg Cu \nLarge surface \ngrains 69,9 16,0 9,3 4,9 \nRecrystallised \ngrains in the \ncentre \n69,0 16,3 9,3 5,3 \nTable 1: Chemical composition comparison \nbetween large surface grains and those in \nthe centre from EDX analysis \nFig. 10: Microstructure etched in Keller reagent of \nthe transition between machined zone and the non- \nmachined zone from a slug heated with cycle 0 bar \nD35mm shown on figure 8 \nFig. 11: Microstructure etched in Keller \nreagent of the upper corner from a slug \nheated with cycle 0 bar D35mm shown on \nfigure 8 \n \n \n \nduring thixoforging should be minor due to their low thickness [6]. A seven step heating \ncycle is used to approach slowly, in a homogeneous way, a target temperature whilst \nallowing kinetic transformations like the solid-liquid transition to occur.  \n\u2022 Low frequency heating at 2,3 kHz is twice as efficient on our device as 5,4 kHz. The \nfrequency variation does not significantly influence recrystallisation.  \n\u2022 The position of the slug in the inductor does not have an influence on the \nrecrystallisation. \n\u2022 The use of a protective gas leads to large grains on the side of the slug.   \n\u2022 Another source of low recrystallised grains is the side of the extruded material. In this \nzone, there is not enough stored energy because of friction during rolling to reach round \nrecrystallised grains. This layer, about 2 to 3 mm on diameter, should be machined to \nhave a microstructure with full round solid grains. There is no influence observed of \noxide layer on recrystallisation. \n\u2022 The chamfer on the top of slugs is not needed at 600\u00b0C because there is no variation of \nsolid fraction in the upper corner of the slug. \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge University of Li\u00e8ge and Walloon Region (First Europe Project) \nfor their support.
