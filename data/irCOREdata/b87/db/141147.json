The technique involves interrogation of a discrete area by scanning a\nprobe electrode across its surface in a similar manner as utilised in atomic force\nmicroscopy except that in SECM the electrochemical nature of the surface is investigated.\nA wide range of distinctly different bioanalytical problems have been examined utilizing\nSECM, as reviewed elsewhere [1]. One common theme is to immobilise biological\nspecies such as enzymes onto a surface. The enzymes can then be used to catalyse the\nconsumption or formation of an electrochemically active product, such as hydrogen\nperoxide, when exposed to a suitable substrate. This process can either be detected\ndirectly or by the use of a suitable mediator such as a ferrocene compound or other\nelectroactive systems such as methylene blue.\nOxidase enzymes have been studied using SECM; one early paper for example\ndiscussed the immobilisation of carbodiimide activated glucose oxidase onto an\naminothiol coated gold surface with the resultant surface being analysed with SECM in\nthe presence of glucose and a ferricyanide mediator [2]. Using this method both the\ntopography and electrochemical activity of the composite surface could be imaged. Much\nof the early work on patterned enzyme surfaces and their imaging by SECM has been\nreviewed [3].\nHorseradish peroxidase could be grafted onto glass slides using biotin-avidin\ninteractions, immobilisation within crosslinked hydrogels on glass slides - or within the\n3pores of a polycarbonate membrane [4]. When the filters were imaged using SECM, the\nenzyme-filled pores could be clearly resolved. Patterns of oxidase enzymes could be\ndeposited by soft lithography and imaged using SECM [5]. In other work glucose\ndehydrogenase could be bound to strepavidin modified magnetic microbeads, deposited\non a surface and the resultant microarray imaged by SECM [6, 7]. Multiple enzyme\narrays have also been studied; galactoxidase and glucose dehydrogenase have, for\nexample, previously been combined in microspots and imaged by SECM [8]. SECM and\nAFM techniques have also been combined using a single probe to enable both\ntopographic and electrochemical imaging of a patterned enzyme surface [9]. Carbon\nmicrodisc electrodes have been used to image HRP patterns [10] and further work\nsuccessfully developed carbon disc electrodes with diameters of a few hundred nm [11].\nEnzymatic arrays were produced using inkjet printing techniques in which individual\nsquare spots in a grid pattern could be deposited. These contained different proportions of\nglucose oxidase and a polymer matrix - and therefore yielded different levels of activity\nwhich could be followed using SECM [12]. SECM has also been used to investigate\npolyelectrolyte multilayers containing cationic polymer and anionic glucose oxidase\nlayers and showed that the catalytic activity within these systems was essentially\nrestricted to the uppermost enzyme layer [13].\nThe activity of enzymes has led them to be utilised as labels for the determination\nof other biochemical binding events in SECM. For example workers immobilised single\nstranded DNA on surfaces, and exposed this to the complementary strand which had been\nlabeled with glucose oxidase [14]. Monitoring the enzyme activity at the surface with\nSECM allowed the determination of hybridization events. Similarly target DNA strands\n4could be labeled with biotin and then biotin-avidin interactions utilised to conjugate with\na biotinylated HRP label [15]. These types of systems can also be used within\nimmunoassays; antibodies to the cancer-related marker CA15-3 could be immobilised on\nsurfaces and then exposed to the antigen. Further exposure to a HRP-labeled second\nantibody gave rise to a sandwich type assay which could be visualised and quantified by\nSECM [16]. Besides these examples a number of other proteins have been imaged by\nSECM as reviewed previously [1].\nIn earlier work we have within our laboratory studied the label-free monitoring of\nbiochemical interactions at electrode surfaces. Besides utilizing the SECM as an imaging\nprocedure, we also simplified the generation of the biochemical arrays by utilizing the\nSECM as a tool for their fabrication. We have previously demonstrated both\nhybridization of genomic DNA [17] and also immunochemical detection of a stroke\nmarker protein, Neuron Specific Enolase [18]. To improve detection of these types of\nevents such as protein expression in cell membranes, we are developing labeled\ntechniques to increase sensitivity. As an early stage within the development of these\ntechniques we have studied the use of the SECM in fabricating enzyme microarrays,\ndeveloped a relatively simple chemistry to ensure enzyme immobilisation and also\noptimised the imaging process to maximise sensitivity.\nExperimental\nChemicals and array fabrication.\n5Nitric acid (70%), sulphuric acid (95-98%), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(APTES), hydrogen peroxide, horseradish peroxidase and hydroquinone were obtained\nfrom Sigma Aldrich (Gillingham, Dorset, UK). Disodium hydrogen orthophosphate\nmonohydrate, sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate 12-hydrate and sodium chloride (all\n\u2018AnalaR\u2019 grade), were purchased from BDH (Poole, Dorset, UK). All chemicals were\nused without further purification. All water used was purified with an ELGA Purelab\nUHQ purifier. Phosphate buffer (PBS), pH 7.1 contained NaH2PO4 (4 mM), Na2HPO4 (6\nmM) and NaCl (132 mM).\nGlass microscope slides were cleaned by immersion in a 1:1 solution of 95%\nH2SO4 and 70% HNO3 for ten minutes. These were then removed from the acid, washed,\nrinsed with sterile UHQ water and dried. Following drying, slides were immersed in\nacetone and dried before immersion in a 1% solution of APTES in acetone for 2 minutes\n- after which they were allowed to dry. Screen printed electrodes consisting of carbon\nworking and counter electrodes together with an Ag\/AgCl reference were supplied by\nMicroarray Ltd. (Manchester, UK).\n5 mg of horseradish peroxidase was dissolved in 1 ml of 1% glutaraldehyde and\nconsecutive dilutions prepared down to 0.0625 mg ml-1. For experiments involving\napproach curves only, a small volume (50 \u03bcl) was deposited onto the surface; this was\nthen allowed to crosslink with the excess being rinsed off after 10 minutes. In all cases,\nthe location of the deposited enzyme was marked by the use of a glass-cutter pen on the\nunderside of the glass slide.\n6A borosilicate glass capillary was pulled to an internal diameter of 20-30 \u00b5m\nusing a Narashige PP-830 pipette puller and the tip polished to a square finish. Deposition\nof arrays of HRP was carried out as described previously for DNA and antibodies [17,\n18] using the pulled microcapillary to deposit the enzyme\/glutaraldehyde solution onto\nthe silanised glass slides by micromanipulation of the tip position using the SECM270\nXYZ stage. After patterning, the slide was dried for 10 minutes, rinsed with UHQ water\nand stored in pH 7.1 phosphate buffer until required.\nSECM interrogation\nSECM experiments were carried out using an Uniscan SECM270 (Uniscan\nInstruments Ltd, Buxton, UK) as described previously [1, 17, 18]. The SECM instrument\nis composed of an electrochemical cell, a translational stage capable of high resolution\n(sub-micron) movement in the X, Y and Z planes and a bipotentiostat all interfaced with\na PC using bespoke software for computer control18. Pt working and counter electrodes\nand Ag\/AgCl reference electrodes were used throughout.\nThe patterned slide was positioned on the SECM stage and the entire assembly\nleveled. 1 ml of 2 mM hydroquinone in pH 7 buffer was then placed on the slide and the\nthree electrodes positioned within the droplet. The microelectrode tip was then set at +0.8\nV which was sufficient for the oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone. An approach\ncurve was conducted over the functionalised region; when the observed tip current begin\nto fall, the approach curve was halted and the tip retracted 1000 \u03bcm. The tip was stopped\nat this stage so as to prevent tip crash and any damage to the immobilised enzyme layer. 1\nml of 2 mM H2O2 was then injected into the system, resulting in a mediator solution\n7composed of 1 mM hydroquinone and 1 mM H2O2. After a specific period (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or\n10 min), the tip was biased at -0.4 V to detect the benzoquinone produced by the\nimmobilised enzyme and an approach curve was conducted over the enzyme modified\nregion at a rate of 10 \u03bcm per step (10 \u03bcm s-1); the tip was stopped when the approach\ncurve profile began to fall off \u2013 i.e. when negative feedback was observed. Each scan\ntherefore took just over a minute to run. It was not possible to monitor the production of\nbenzoquinone immediately after the introduction of the hydrogen peroxide using the\napproach curve because of the time delay between the commencement of the scan and the\npoint at which the tip comes into close proximity to the immobilised enzyme For\npatterned slides, area scans were conducted over the region of interest at a rate of 20 \u03bcm\nper step over areas up to 1200x1200 \u03bcm in size. Figure 1 shows a schematic for the\ninterrogation process. One challenge with SECM is accurate determination of the\nabsolute nature of surfaces since many factors such as tip-to-surface distance or surface\nhomogeneity affect the response. The usage of a patterned array allows visualization of\nthe contrast between enzyme modified and unmodified regions of the surface which\nallows the cancellation of non-specific effects.\nResults and Discussion\nMeasurement of enzyme activity and diffusional characteristics.\nThe first step of our investigation was to determine approach curves over inactive control\nsurfaces. Two slides were used as controls in this study \u2013 a silanised glass microscope\nslide along with a slide which had been functionalised with glutaraldehyde-crosslinked\n8horseradish peroxidase and then exposed to a heat treatment (placed in an oven at 80oC\nfor 15 mins). Approach curves were conducted over these slides in a mediator solution\ncontaining 1 mM hydroquinone and 1 mM hydrogen peroxide in a pH 7.1 buffered\nsolution. The resulting approach curve for the heat-treated HRP-modified glass slide is\npresented in figure 2. There is a small background current observed at large distances\nfrom the slide even in the absence of electrochemical activity, this is because the tip is\ncharged at the potential applied and ions from the electrolyte diffuse towards the tip to\nform a double layer, this is known as the capacitive current (Ic). As the tip is moved into\nclose proximity to the slide, diffusion of ions around the microelectrode is hindered and\npotentially limits the thickness of the double layer. This leads to a drop in tip current\n(known as negative feedback) due to the hindered diffusion around the microelectrode.\nThese observations suggest that the heat treatment denatures the HRP immobilised at the\nsurface, diminishing its ability to catalyse the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water via\nthe oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone. Almost identical approach curves to\nthose obtained for denatured HRP-slides were also obtained using silanised, insulating\nglass slides.\nBy contrast studies utilizing glass slides with immobilised, active HRP showed very\ndifferent behavior. On approaching a HRP functionalised surface, the tip current is\nobserved to increase to a peak value before exhibiting a sharp fall (figure 2). This is in\ncontrast to the negative feedback curves obtained when approaching an insulating,\nnon-functionalised slide or denatured slide. The increase in current can be explained in\nterms of the generation of benzoquinone by the immobilised enzyme at the slide surface.\nSince the rate at which the benzoquinone molecules can diffuse away from the surface is\n9slower than the rate at which they are being produced by the enzyme, a concentration\ngradient arises and extends into the solution; in this way, the concentration of\nbenzoquinone at the functionalised surface is greater than that in bulk solution. As a\nresult of this increase in concentration, there is a proportional increase in the faradaic\ncurrent as the tip approaches the surface. However, as the tip comes into close proximity\nto the HRP-functionalised surface, the diffusion of the enzymatic product from the\nsurface to the tip is hindered by the insulating glass sheath around the conductive region\nof the probe, resulting in a lowering in current akin to that observed for a probe\napproaching an insulating slide.\nControl experiments were also made using active-HRP slides in buffer, in buffer\ncontaining 1 mM hydroquinone (but no H2O2) and in buffer containing 1 mM H2O2 but\nno hydroquinone. In all three cases no current flow due to enzymatically produced\nbenzoquinone could be detected.\nTo allow comparison with the control curves, the approach curves were normalised to the\ncurrent observed in bulk solution (figure 2) i.e. the plot shows the tip currents obtained at\neach distance divided by that observed in bulk solution. In this particular example, at a\ndistance of 600 \u03bcm from the slide surface, the tip current is equal to the tip current\nobtained in bulk solution. However, as the tip approaches the slide, the tip current\nincreases to a peak, indicating a local benzoquinone concentration higher that observed\n600 \u03bcm away in bulk solution. Approach curves were also carried out with H2O2\nconcentrations of 0.2 mM, 0.4 mM and 0.6 mM, these displayed no significant\ndifferences to those at 1 mM indicating that there is a large enough excess of H2O2 for it\nnot to be a determining factor in the reaction kinetics.\n10\nTo determine the effect of enzyme loading on the observed current, the silanised glass\nslide was functionalised using solutions containing different concentrations of enzyme \u2013\nspecifically, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.05 and 0.025 mg of HRP per ml of 1%\nglutaraldehyde solution. A 50 \u03bcl droplet of each loading solution was pipetted onto the\nsilanised glass surface and allowed to crosslink for five minutes before the slide was\nrinsed and stored in pH 7.1 buffer until used. Approach curves were measured as before.\nThe average background subtracted peak currents (i.e. the maximum currents observed\nfor each concentration) were then plotted (figure 3). As can be seen, there is a steady\nincrease of peak tip current with enzyme concentration between 0-1 mg ml-1. Above this\nlimit, further increases in enzyme concentration have minimal effect. The lowest\nmeasured current peak detected was for the slide functionalised with 0.025 mg ml-1\nenzyme solution and was calculated to be due to a benzoquinone concentration of 1.2 x\n10-12 mol ml-1. The observed relationship between the average peak tip current and the\nenzyme concentration in the loading solution may be due to two possible reasons, as\ndescribed below.\nThe first possible explanation relates to the density of enzyme on the surface; on treating\nthe silanised glass with a 1 mg ml-1 solution, if the surface is saturated with the enzyme\nand all cross-linking sites are occupied, the use of enzyme loading solutions with 2, 3, 4\nand 5 mg ml-1 may result in no further increase in the concentration of enzyme\nimmobilised at the slide surface. The effect of such surface saturation would be that the\npeak current observed over each of these saturated slides was similar in magnitude.\nA second hypothesis for this observation is based on the diffusional kinetics of the\nimmobilised enzyme. When the rate of diffusion of the reactants to the enzyme is greater\n11\nthan the rate of the enzymatic reaction, the overall rate of the enzymatic reaction would\nbe under the kinetic control of the enzyme. Under these conditions, if one were to\nincrease the concentration of the enzyme at the surface, the enzymatic activity per unit\narea would also increase, resulting in an enhancement in the production of benzoquinone\nand consequently a higher peak current when interrogated by SECM. At the lower\nenzyme concentrations, on increasing the concentration of enzyme at the surface, an\nincremental increase in the peak current would be observed. However, on increasing the\nconcentration of the loading solution to 1 mg ml-1 and above, the peak current plateaus.\nThis is thought to be due to the fact that at this level of enzymatic activity per unit area,\nthe rate of the enzymatic reaction per unit area is faster than the rate at which the\nreactants, hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, can reach the immobilised enzyme by\ndiffusion, i.e. the rate of the enzymatic reaction is limited by the rate of diffusion of the\nsubstrate to the enzyme.\nTo ascertain the diffusional kinetics of this system, a series of approach curves were\nconducted at specific time periods. This strategy allows monitoring of the diffusion of the\nenzymatic product, benzoquinone, from the slide with time. In this way, a measurement\nof the rates of benzoquinone diffusion may be obtained which would aid the acquirement\nand interpretation of area scan data. Approach curves were conducted at t = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\nand 10 minutes from the introduction of hydrogen peroxide to the mediator solution. An\nexample of the approach curves observed is shown in figure 4.\nApproach curves were conducted at a scan rate of 5 \u03bcm per point so as to minimise\ndisturbance of the diffusion layer emanating from the HRP functionalised slide. If\napproach curves were conducted at any greater speed, whilst they would allow\n12\nmeasurements to be taken faster, the movement of the tip towards the surface could\ndisturb the diffusion layer by mechanical convection.\nIn the example given (figure 4), at t = 0, the bulk concentration of benzoquinone is very\nlow, resulting in a low initial tip current up to 600 \u03bcm from the surface. As the tip\napproaches the enzyme functionalised slide, the tip current was observed to increase to\napproximately 3.2 nA above the background current, due to the reduction of\nbenzoquinone produced by the enzyme catalysed reaction. A second approach curve\nbegun two minutes after of the addition of hydrogen peroxide showed similar behaviour\nexcept that the current began to rise much sooner, indicating that benzoquinone has\ndiffused away from the surface and is being detected at the microelectrode at a greater\ndistance from the slide. When t=4 minutes this behaviour is even more pronounced, with\nbenzoquinone being detected as soon as the approach curve begins and with longer time\nintervals the benzoquinone concentration is becoming much more uniform throughout the\nsystem; at t=10 min there is only a relatively small difference between tip current close to\nthe surface and in bulk solution.\nThe SECM was also used to determine the distribution of the benzoquinone product in\nsolution with increasing time. The first step was to determine the diffusion coefficient for\nbenzoquinone under the conditions of the protocol described within this paper. A cyclic\nvoltammagram for benzoquinone (2 mM) in buffer was measured utilising the screen\nprinted electrodes described in earlier work [17]. The Randles-Sevcik equation (a\nsimplified version is shown in equation 1) can be used to determine the diffusional\ncoefficient of benzoquinone from the peak current of the CV.\n13\nEquation 1:\nIn this relationship, the peak current (ip) in a cyclic voltammogram for the species under\ninterrogation is expressed as a function of n, the number of electrons involved in the\ncharge transfer reaction (two in this case), A the electrode area (cm2), v the sweep rate, D\nthe analyte diffusion coefficient (cm2 s-1) and C the concentration in mol ml-1. For an\nelectrode area of 0.24 cm2, a sweep rate of 0.05 V s-1 and a concentration of 2 mM, a\npeak current of 2.01 \u03bcA was obtained. This led to a diffusion coefficient of 2.46 x 10-\n5cm2s-1 for benzoquinone in buffer being calculated under these specific conditions. This\nfigure is in good agreement with previous results [19, 20].\nThe faradaic current observed at a microelectrode in bulk solution is described below\nwhere a is the radius of the microelectrode and F the Faraday constant [21].\nEquation 2:\nDuring the approach curves over HRP modified glass, at any point in bulk solution, the\ncurrent may be described by equation 2. Given the tip current, the area of the working\nelectrode and the diffusion coefficient for the species under detection, it is possible from\nthis equation to estimate the concentration of benzoquinone at each point along each\napproach curve. The change in the benzoquinone concentration profile over time for a 5\nmg ml-1 HRP functionalised slide is presented in figure 4, which demonstrates the slow\ndiffusion of the benzoquinone out into solution. Initially, the concentration gradient is\nhigh as the rate at which benzoquinone can diffuse away from the site of the enzymatic\nACDvnip\n2\/12\/12\/35 )10687.2( \uf0b4\uf03d\nnFDCaiT 4\uf03d\uf0a5\n14\nreaction is slower than the rate at which it is produced by the enzyme. As time elapses,\nthe rate of diffusion of the enzymatic substrate to the enzyme becomes slower than the\nrates at which benzoquinone is created by the enzyme and later diffused to the bulk\nsolution, thus, kinetically controlling the whole process. The result is that this decrease in\nthe rate of benzoquinone production allows benzoquinone to become more evenly\ndistributed in the volume of solution in the vicinity of the enzyme \u2013 i.e. the difference in\nbenzoquinone concentration between adjacent points along the approach curve axis\nbecomes smaller. After 10 minutes there is only a small difference between the peak\ncurrent and that measured in bulk solution - hundreds of nm from the surface. This is\nimportant in the context that if we wish to image arrays there must not be a long interval\nbetween substrate addition and the imaging procedure, otherwise the benzoquinone\nproduct will diffuse away from the active sites and become more evenly distributed\nthroughout the solution, rendering the acquirement of high resolution scans problematic.\nImaging horseradish peroxidase activity\nThe next stage of our work was to develop an appropriate method for imaging HRP\nactivity. Using the same patterning techniques as those employed earlier [17, 18],\npatterned HRP arrays were fabricated using the XYZ micro-positioner. The spacing of\nthe arrays was an essential consideration to avoid the merging of diffusion layers \u2013 which\nwould affect the resolution of the array. If the array dots were placed too close together,\nthere would be a risk of their diffusion layers overlapping, resulting in two dots appearing\nas one. It was found that by positioning them up to 500\u03bcm apart in a grid format, they\nwere sufficiently distant from one another to appear as two distinct dots.\n15\nAs described previously within this paper, a potential issue is the fact that benzoquinone\ndiffuses away from its site of production. In the case of a patterned array, this could lead\nto imaging becoming problematic, since if the benzoquinone is evenly distributed\nthroughout the solution, no resolution of the pattern can occur. At the scanning rate used\n(20 \u03bcm per step), imaging of a 1200x1200 \u03bcm area requires approximately one hour.\nIncreasing the scan rate beyond this could well lead to interference due to rapid tip\nmovement. Figure 4 indicates that after 10 minutes the benzoquinone distribution with\nrespect to tip distance is quite even, however these results were for a completely coated\nslide. In the case of small patterned areas, much less benzoquinone is produced overall\n(less than 10% of the area imaged is coated with HRP) and such small areas experience\nhemispherical diffusion profiles (in a similar manner to microelectrodes) which means\nbenzoquinone concentrations will fall more rapidly with distance from the enzyme coated\nareas. Therefore there will still be a measurable contrast between the coated islands and\nthe uncoated slide.\nBefore conducting area scans over the HRP arrays, approach curves were carried out over\na non-functionalised region of the microscope slide patterned with the array. The tip was\npositioned 50 \u03bcm above the point at which the tip current was 50% of that in bulk. The\nchoice to position the probe at this height was based on observing the behaviour of the tip\ncurrent when approaching the HRP functionalised slide in the previous series of approach\ncurves. It was at this height where the peak current was obtained and where negligible\nfeedback effects were observed. After positioning the tip in this Z axis, the tip was then\nmoved through solution and positioned proximal to the horseradish peroxidase array,\n16\nprior to hydrogen peroxide being introduced into the system. The area scan was then\nconducted over the functionalised slide.\nThis initial set of experiments were carried out to determine the effect of substrate\nconcentration on the enzymatic reaction. Area scans were conducted in a buffered\nmediator solution comprising 1 mM hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide at\nconcentrations of 1 mM, 0.6 mM, 0.4 mM and 0.2 mM. We observed that on using\nsmaller concentrations of the hydrogen peroxide substrate, the resolution of the images\ndepreciated. Using hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0.6 mM or above, the area scans\nrecorded distinct and well defined regions of enzymatic activity (figure 5). Those scans\nwhich have been obtained using hydrogen peroxide in lower concentrations however\nhave poorly defined functionalised regions, indicative of lowered enzymatic activity\n(images not shown). From these experiments, optimal imaging seems to occur at\nhydrogen peroxide concentrations of 0.6 mM, results somewhat different from the simple\napproach curve data.\nBackground subtraction\nBackground subtractions were performed to improve the resolution of the area scan\nimages obtained. In doing so, the current range of the images was lowered. The\nadvantages of utilizing background subtraction include removing the tip current variation\ndue to slide slope as well minimizing variation due to the concentration of benzoquinone\nin bulk solution. The subtraction was achieved post-scan by constructing a background\narray from a line of data extracted from the experimental area scans.\n17\nA line of data from an unsubstituted portion of the array was analyzed and gave a\nmeasurement of the slope of the slide. This could be utilised to generate a model sloped\nbackground area. This background area was then subtracted from the original\nexperimental area scan to obtain the background subtracted, optimally resolved area scan\nimages, of the array.\nAn alternative strategy to the background subtraction method employed here would be to\nhave conducted an area scan before and following the addition of the hydrogen peroxide\nand then to have subtracted the \u2018before\u2019 scan from the \u2018after\u2019 scan. The reasons for not\ndoing so are threefold: firstly, although the un-catalysed reaction between hydroquinone\nand hydrogen peroxide is very slow, the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the system may\nhave an effect on the concentration of benzoquinone in bulk, resulting in an increase in\nthe bulk concentration of benzoquinone that would not have been catered for by the\nsimple subtraction of the \u2018before\u2019 data. Secondly, on the addition of the hydrogen\nperoxide to the system, the bulk concentration of the mediator is altered, which would\nhave implications for the validity of comparing the two scans. Thirdly, on conducting the\nfirst scan, a tip crash might occur and also the tip may become fouled on the first scan,\nwhich again would introduce error to the data, affecting the validity of the subtraction.\nUsing the methodology described, well defined, high resolution images were obtained\nwhich illustrate the applicability of the technique to imaging enzymatic activity. Figure 6\nshows a well resolved scan of a HRP array. When a single cross-sectional line of data is\nextracted and plotted to show a profile of three of the dots, it is apparent that there is good\ncorrelation of the dot footprints. A significant limitation of the substrate generation, tip\ncollection mode is that during scanning, the electrode is moved through the diffusion\n18\nlayers extending into solution around the area of interest, which may lead to the\nredistribution of electroactive species over the slide. Such movement of these species\nmay then lead to a poorly resolved image whereby it is difficult to determine where on\nthe slide the reaction is occurring. Despite this potential problem, it is apparent from this\nwork that well resolved images may be obtained.\nConclusions\nThe principle aim of this work was to explore the possibility of using SECM to both\nconstruct and characterise regular arrays of enzymes on surfaces. We have developed an\noptimised procedure for the deposition and imaging of HRP arrays.\nIn the series of experiments described here, the use of SECM in generation collection\n(GC) mode allowed for the sensitive imaging of HRP activity. On conducting approach\ncurves over HRP modified glass, the low detection limits of the SECM technique were\ndemonstrated. Silanised glass was loaded with glutaraldehyde-crosslinked horseradish\nperoxidase present in concentrations down to 0.025 mg ml-1.\nBy observing the difference between the peak currents obtained by approach curve over\nslides loaded with differing concentrations of HRP, it was found that this technique is\ncapable of differentiating between surfaces functionalised using different concentrations\nof enzyme loading solution in the range 0-1 mg ml-1. Above this limit, further increases\nled to only minimal changes in tip current. Using approach curves, benzoquinone\nconcentrations down to as low as 1.2 x 10-12 mol ml-1 were detected, demonstrating\nexcellent sensitivity.\n19\nThe imaging capabilities of the SECM to this system have been demonstrated. Imaging\nan array fabricated by the deposition of a HRP\/glutaraldehyde solution on glass allowed a\nwell resolved array to be defined and dots spaced 500 \u03bcm apart were clearly resolved\nfrom one another. Obtaining such a well resolved pattern was, however, unexpected.\nSince the generation\/collection mode involves imaging the enzymatic product in the\ndiffusion layer, it was thought that there would be a considerable lack of resolution in the\nimages obtained as the tip \u2018dragged\u2019 enzymatic product from the vicinity in which it was\nproduced as it was moved through the diffusion layer. This was not the case however and\nvery good resolution was observed.\nVarying the concentration of hydrogen peroxide had a significant effect on the quality of\nimage obtained. By limiting the concentration of enzyme substrate, the rate of enzymatic\nreaction was lowered, which in turn had the effect of lowering the quantity of enzymatic\nproduct generated by the enzyme and so, the size of the diffusion layer. The result of this\neffect was to lower the resolution of the image with significant inter-dot variation.\nBoth investigations into the diffusional kinetics affecting surfaces modified with HRP\nhave been presented, along with demonstrating a methodology by which horseradish\nperoxidase activity could be imaged. One challenge with the study of this reaction is that\nthe enzymatic reaction is exceptionally rapid, even though the rate of diffusion is\nrelatively slow. Benzoquinone is produced rapidly by the enzyme, but the rate at which it\ndiffuses from the slide and into solution is subsequently slow, resulting in a difficulty in\ndifferentiating diffusion profiles due to slides functionalised with similar surface enzyme\nconcentrations.\n20\nHowever, since the intention was to use the enzyme as an electroactive label for\nfollowing surface binding events, the results presented here demonstrate the suitability of\nthe detection method as a viable route for the further development of this assay. In\naddition, the micropatterning capabilities of the Uniscan micro-positioning device have\nbeen further demonstrated, enabling rapid array construction without the necessity to\npurchase another piece of equipment.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council\n(EPSRC) of the UK and Uniscan Instruments Ltd for sponsorship of an Eng.D degree for\nWSR.\nReferences\n[1] W.
