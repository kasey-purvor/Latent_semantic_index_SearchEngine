It is therefore imperative that degradation in \nsuch'systems be detected and quantified at an early stage \nin its development so that appropriate replacement\/refur- \nbishment can he arranged at a convenient time. When \ndegradation occurs in such systems, irrespective of the \ncausative mechanism, it generally results in partial dis- \ncharges being generated (small electrical sparks within the \ninsulation). Once prevalent, partial discharges then repre- \nsent the dominant mechanism of degradation. For this \nreason, it can be appreciated why the detection and char- \nacterization of partial discharge activity is a key approach \nin insulation system condition monitoring [l]. \nPartial discharge (PD) detection involves the capture, \nstorage and processing of PD signals, which occur in the \nform of individual or series of electrical pulses. By acquir- \ning the data at a convenient, non-intrusive location, usu- \nally the phase or neutral terminals of the power equip- \nment under test, statistical quantities such as the PD-pulse \nmagnitude, phase distribution (over the ac power cycle) \nand their variation with time a n  he obtained [Z]. Further- \nmore, based on these quantities, the mechanisms of PD \nactivity can be categorized, and the nature, form and the \nextent of degradation can be inferred. \nTraditionally, the techniques used for signal processing \nare realized in either the time or  frequency domain to \nanalyze and extract PD events. In the case of the fre- \nquency domain, for instance, the Fourier transform as- \nsumes that any signal could he decomposed into a series \nof sine and cosine waveforms and then summarized by \nthese basis functions. Although the signal under analysis \ncan be localized arbitrarily throughout the frequency do- \nmain following the Fourier transform, information in time \nis, however, lost. With regard to the PD pulse structure, \nthere always exist non-periodic and fast transient features \nin the PD signals detected, which tend to be ignored and \ncannot bc revealed efficiently and explicitly by this kind of \nconventional transform. For these reasons, when the \nFourier transform is applied to partial dischargc analysis, \nit has serious limitations. \nDespite the advances achieved during past decades in \nmeasuring instrumentation, partial discharge detection \ncircuits, e.g., the ultra wide-band detectors coupled to \nreal-time oscilloscopes of very wide bandwidth (up to 4 \nGHz), a sophisticated analytical tool of similar power to \npre-process PD data has yet to he realized. \nSince its introduction to practical applications in thc \nmid-1980s as a powerful mathematical means of signal \nIEEE Transactions on DielecIrics and Electrical Insulation Vol. 9, No. 3, June 2002 447 \nanalysis and signal processing, the wavelet and its associ- \nated transforms r3-51 have been increasingly recognized \nby researchers and engineers and utilized to solve many \nengineering problems. This paper describes the use of the \nwavelet transform to obtain two-dimensional information \non PD pulses in both the time and frequency domain, and \nto extract features of PD pulses in the measurement data. \nThe paper ccnters on the following questions: \n(1) What is the wavelet, its categories and the associ- \nated transforms? \n(2) How is the wavelet, most suitable for analysis of PD \nmeasurement data, acquired in different detectors? \n(3)  How can the specific wavelet \u201cpattern\u201dfol1owing the \nwavelet transform (WT) be used to differentiate PD from \nother signals such as noise? \n(4) How successfully can the WT be utilized in prac- \ntice? \n2 WAVELET METHODOLOGY \nA wavelet, as its name implies, can he interpreted as a \nsmall wave that has a limited duration and a zero mean \nvalue. It oscillates in amplitude and decays to zero quickly \non both sides of the central position of the waveform. \nCompared to sine and cosine waves, the hasis functions of \nthe Fourier transform, which extend from minus to plus \ninfinity, wavelets usually tend to he irregular and asym- \nmetric in terms of wave shape. An example wavelet + ( t )  \nis shown in Figure la.  \nFrom a mathematical viewpoint, if a wavelet is defined \nas $([I, it has.the property of equation (1) and has to \nsatisfy the admissibility condition C,(O < C, <m) in equa- \nRe& hqwncy (b) \nFigure 1. Comparisons between scaled wavelets in the time domain \nand in the frequency domain. a, scaled wavelets in the time domain; \nb, their results following the Fourier transform. \ntion (2) so that a signal can he decomposed and then re- \nconstructed perfectly through the wavelet transform. \nwhere 4 is the form of the Fourier transform of + ( t ) ,  \nand R the set of real numbers. In wavelet terms, +(f) is \nreferred to as the mother wavelet. The family of scaled \nwavelets associated with $(\/I can be described as \n\/ \n$ ( a t )  = a - \u2019 f l + ( - ) ,  l7 ( a = 1 , 2 , 3  , _ _ _ )  (3) \nwhere the scaling variable a determines the amplitude and \nthe duration of + ( a \/ ) .  More precisely, the amplitude of \n+ ( a \/ )  is inversely proportional to the value of the square \nroot of a, whereas its duration is linearly proportional to \na, thus ensuring that each scaled wavelet has the equiva- \nlent energy of the mother wavelet, as can he seen from \nFigure la.  \nAlso as can he observed in Figure lb, the scaled wavelets \nof +(af) have different central frequencies w and band- \nwidth ranges A W ,  high values of a corresponding to low \nvalues of w and A w ,  whereas low values of a yielding \nhigh values of o and A w .  If f in expression (3) is re- \nplaced by \/ - h, the wavelet is shifted by b on the time \naxis. Therefore, localization properties in ,both the timc \nand frequency can be achieved simultaneously when the \nsignals under analysis are examined using such wavelets. \nThere are several families of wavelets already proven to \nhe especially useful in practice 161. In terms of wavelet \nexpressions, some are given explicitly by their time defini- \ntion, including the Gaussian wevclct, the Mcxicdn hat \nwavelet and the Morlet wavelet, and some by their fre- \nquency definition such as the Mcyer wavelet. Others are \nconstructed by their finite impulse response (FIR) filter \npair that exist a special mirror relationship between fil- \nters, also known as quadrature mirror filters (QMFs), typ- \nical examples of which are Daubechies wavelets, Symlet \nwavelets, Coiflet wavelets and Lemarie wavelets. The \nDauhechies wavelets constituted from 4 and 14 coeffi- \ncients in QMFs are shown in Figures 2a, and 2h respec- \ntively; the former is defined as db2, the latter as db7. \nAmong the wavelets available, the Daubechies wavelet \nfamily has almost all of the required properties such as \ncompactness, limited duration, orthogonality and asym- \nmetry for analysis of fast transient, irregular pulses.\u2019 It is \nfor this reason that the Ddubechies wavelet can be ap- \nplied effectively in partial discharge studies. \nConsider now the types of wavelet transform (more the- \noretical details can he found in [3-51). The key idea un- \nderlying the wavelet transform (WT) strategy is that a given \n448 Ma et al.: Interpretation of Wavelet Analysis and its Application in Partial Discharge Detection \nR&b+ be (b) \nFigure 2. Examples of the shape of wavelets. a, db2 wavelet; b, db7 \nwavelet. \nsignal can be disassembled into a series of scaled and time \nshifted forms of mother wavelet producing a time-scale \nview of a signal from which the original signal can he re- \ncovered.

Tree structure of three level FDWT decomposition of a signal. \ntime-dependent signal f(t) is described as \nThe CWT calculates the wavelet coefficients at every \npossible scale and along every time instant. The value of \nW,f(a, b) represents the similarity extent between the ex- \namined section of f(t) and the scaled and shifted wavelets. \nThe greater the W,f(a,b), the  more energetic the \nW+f(a,b), and the greater the similarity between the \nwavelets and the original signal. \nThe discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is realized by \ncharacterizing thc scale variable a in a = 2\u201d\u2019 and assum- \ning the time variable b as b = n2\u201d at a given scale m \n(m,n being integer values), thus avoiding time consumed \nin coefficient calculation and eliminating wavelet coeffi- \ncient redundancy. The practical fast discrete wavelet \ntransform (FDWT) is implemented based on the filtering \nscheme of QMF pairs g, h at different scales as illus- \ntrated in Figure 3. When a signal is fed through a pair of \nlow-pass filter g and high-pass filter h respectively, the \nWT yields the low frequency content and the high fre- \nquency content of the signal respectively, the former be- \ning known as the signal\u2019s \u201capproximations\u201d and the latter \nknown as its \u201cdetails\u201d. \nThe signal can be perfectly reconstructed using the in- \nverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) by starting from \nDetail 1 \nDetail 2 \nDetail 3 \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insuhtion \nthe bottom components and moving to the root compo- \nnent rattier than employing the top to bottom approach of \nthe FDWT. At each synthesis level, both the coarser ap- \nproximations and details are firstly up-sampled by the fac- \ntor of 2 and then convoluted with synthesis filters g, A ,  \nproducing a finer approximation signal. The coefficients \nin synthesis filters g, are identical with those in decom- \nposition filters g, h, but are inverse in the time arrange- \nment. \n3 PULSE SHAPE OF PARTIAL \nDISCHARGES \nThe selection of a suitable wavelet and its associated \nanalysis algorithm is application dependent. For example, \ntime-defined wavelets such as the Gaussian wavelet, the \nMexican hat wavelet and their CWT have often been used \nfor pattern recognition [7], and the Morlet wavelet for \nhigh-impedance fault detection [81 and the analysis of dis- \nturbances within power systems [91. Dyadic orthogonal \nwavelets such as the Daubechies wavelet have found ap- \nplications in data compression and signal demising \n[lo-131. \nPrior to discussing wavelet selection with respect to \npartial discharge studies, it is important to discuss PD \npulse shape. For solid or fluid dielectrics, partial dis- \ncharge phenomena are mainly caused hy voids or bubbles \nwithin or  at the surface of insulating materials. The charge \ndisplacement in  the system produces current flowing in \nthe leads to the object, which can be detected by a cou- \npling capacitor in parallel, or by an impedance in series, \nwith the test sample. Normally discharge pulses are recog- \nnized as having a very steep wave-front and short dura- \ntion. The rise time of the discharge pulse is as low as a \nfew ns (perhaps even faster) whereas its duration is in the \norder of 10 ns. The pulse shape of the discharge current is \ndetermined by the cavity dimension, such as its radius and \nheight, and the external measuring circuit, whereas the \nnumber of almost simultaneously occurring discharges is \ndetermined by the cavity shape. For instance, spherical \ncavities cause onc individual discharge at a time, whereas \nflat cavities yield many discharges at a time [14]. \nIn relation to detection methods, both narrow-band and \nultra wide-band (UWB) detecting circuits have been \nadopted. Narrow-band detection can give an erroneous \nquantification and information loss due to quasi-integra- \ntion adopted or when multiple overlapped pulses exist. \nThe characteristic parameters, which describe the shape \nof an individual discharge pulse, cannot be described ex- \nplicitly in narrow-band detection. With ultra wide-band \n(UWB) detection techniques [14,151 coupled to fast oscil- \nloscope acquisition, the true PD pulse shape can be \nrecorded and the shape of the individual PD pulse can be \nobsemed. Compared to the phase-resolved measurement \nprimarily related to narrow-band detection, UWB detec- \nVol. 9, No. 3, June 2002 449 \n- \n1 \n, .  +*- (d -I \nTime ins) \nFigure 4. Typical time parameters describing the shape of a PD \ncurrent PUlSC. \ntion is primarily associated with time-resolved measure- \nments. \nFigure 4 demonstrates a typical PD current pulse, which \ncould be characterized by a series of discharge parameters \nincluding A (pulse peak value), f, (pulse rise time from \n10% to 90% levels), t ,  (pulse width between 50% levels) \nand fd (pulse decay time from 90% to 10% levels) [11,14]. \nIn practical measurements, discharge voltage signals are \ncaptured by feeding the discharge current through a de- \ntection circuit. On this basis, detected voltage signals are \nlikely to have different pulse shapes, depending on the \nconfiguration of the detection circuit. As far as the detec- \ntion circuit [161 is concerned, it is realized in either a R C  \nimpedance circuit or a RLC impedance circuit, as shown \nin Figures %a) and 5(b) respectively. The transfer func- \ntions of RC and RLC impedance circuits can be expressed \nin the following Laplace forms \nwhere r = RC, and w O  =I,\".

When a practical PD pulse passes i(t) \nthrough a detection circuit, the output pulse produced al- \nways has a finite rise time. Considering the shape of a PD \ncurrent pulse and the characteristics of detection circuits, \nthe damped exponential pulse (DEP) and the damped os- \ncillatory pulse (DOP) can be numerically simulated as the \nmathematical models of (7) and (8) respectively, and fur- \nther displayed in Figures 6a and 6b. \n(7) \n(8) \nDEp( 1 )  = A ( ~ - @ I  - \nD O P ( t )  = Asin(27if,r)(e-\"h -e-\"i ) \nwhere A gives the pulse peak value, f , , t ,  the damping \ncoefficients that determine those typical characteristic pa- \nrameters r,, r,, f d  describing the pulse shape, whilst f, is \nthe oscillatoty frequency of the DOP-type pulse. \n4 OPTIMAL WAVELET SELECTION \nThe WT of a signal produces a wavelet detail coeffi- \ncient distribution throughout the entire time-scale \n(frequency) view which, referred to as the \"wavelet pat- \ntern'' of a signal, depends on the wavelet chosen in the \nWT. For a better understanding of this, an example of a \ndischarge signal with 5 successive DEP-type pulses is given, \nFigure 7. Wavelet patterns of a DEP-type pulse. Sampling fre- \nquency, 1GHz; data record, 2100 points. a, With the db2 wavelet; b, \nWith the db7 wwclct. \nwhere 1, = 5ns, r ,  = Ions and fd = 20ns in each pulse. Its \nwavelet pattern after applying FDWT with 5-level (scale) \nusing the db2 and db7 wavelet is displayed in Figures 7a \nand 7b respectively. Here, FDWT with low level is cho- \nsen as the PD pattern can be characterired within such a \nlevel range. The same reasoning applies for the level de- \ntermination later in characterizing the patterns of noise. \nDespite the similarity in both patterns, the values of their \ncoefficient are significantly different, as seen from all lev- \nels. The \"optimal\" wavelet suitable for analyzing a given \nsignal is the one which is capable of generating as many \ncoefficients with maximal values as possible within the \ntime-scale domain. In this case, db2 is a more appropriate \nwavelet than db7 for analyzing this type of PD pulse. \nIn statistical analysis, the correlation coefficient y [17] \nis used to detect one particular relationship between vari- \nables. The greater the value of y ,  the more approximate \nin wave shape between two variables. Uncorrelated data \nsets result in an y of 0, whereas equivalent data sets have \nan y of 1. For this reason, the correlation coefficient y \ncan also be used as a criterion in identifying an appropri- \nate wavelet choice for PD pulse examination as described \nbelow: \n1. the discharge pulse data sct is first obtained from its \nmathematical expression (7) or (81, and \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation \ndb2 \ndb3 \nVol. 9, No. 3, June 2002 451 \n0.5272 0.2410 \n0.4557 0.2042 \ndb4 \ndb5 \ndb6 \ndb7 \ndb8 \ndb9 \ndbl0 \nd b l l  \ndb12 \ndb13 \ndb14 \ndbl5 \ndb16 I \ndb19 \ndb20 \nsvm2 I \n0.3761 0.3281 \n0.0234 0.7841 \n0.2213 0.3526 \n0.1443 0.7747 \n0.0447 0.7257 \n0.0632 0.6590 \n0.0151 0.5607 \n0.0196 0.5894 \n0.0633 0.6108 \n0.0708 0.6055 \n0.0622 0.6075 \nn.0516 0.6057 \n0.0231 0.5949 \n0.0212 0.5755 \n0.0418 0.5648 \n0.U484 0.5351 \n0.0527 (l.5517 \n0.5237 0.2410 \n0.4557 0.3486 \n0.5126 0.28(10 \nlem3 0.2462 0.5972 \n2. the wavelet data set is acquired from thc available \nwavelet families by use of the aforementioned methods in \nthe section of wavelet methodology, \n3. a set of correlation coefficients y is then calculated \nand finally \n4. after comparing all of the correlation coefficients, the \noptimal wavelet for the defined discharge pulse is the one \nwith the maximal value of y. \nFor example, let us consider a DEP-type pulse with pa- \nrameters t ,  = 5ns, t ,  = l0ns and Id = 20ns and a DOP-type \npulse with the same time paramcters as above with an \noscillation frequency f, = 2OMHz. Table 1 lists all of the \ncalculated values of the correlation coefficient y between \nthe PD pulses and the available wavelets investigated, \nwhere all of wavelets are named using their abbreviations \nand the number behind indicates thc order of the wavelct \nin its corresponding family. The results show that the dh2 \nis the best wavelet for the DEP-type discharge pulse and \nthe db7 for the DOP-typc pulse. It can he seen from Fig- \nures 8a and 8b that the bcst wavelct based on the corrcla- \ntion coefficients appear remarkably similar to the pulse \nunder analysis. \nDoes this tcchnique apply to all other discharge pulses \nwith different characteristic parameters? The authors be- \nlieve that during the WT, the mother wavelet is scaled \nboth in amplitude and in duration at different scales pro- \nducing the best match result with the detected discharge \npulse at a certain scale as long as a reasonable mother \nwavelet is chosen. Normally, the wavclets with lower order \nsuch as db2, db3, sym?, sym3, Iem2 and lem3 are appro- \npriate to the PD data measured with RC detection circuit, \nwhilst for the PD data measured with RLC detection cir- \ncuit, higher order wavelets of db6 - dblO are appropriate. \nI M  2w IW 400 YUI 6W 7W 8oJ \nR & b  he (b) \nFigure 8.

Over the years, methods employing \nfiltering techniques [18]: neural networks [191 etc., have \nbeen designed to suppress noise with some limited suc- \ncess. To date, only a few research papers [I 1,131 have been \npublished using the wavelet analysis technique to deal with \nnoise problems in PD studies. Angrisani ct al. [ll] dealt \nwith thc distortion in the PD pulse by cxternal interfer- \nence due to poor electrical contacts and random noise in \nan ultra widc-band measurement system to improve the \nrecognition of the pulse's time parameters, where mea- \nsurement data have a very high signal to noise ratio. Shim \net al. [13] gave a general introduction on the relationship \nbetwcen wavelets and filters and wavelet based denoising. \n452 Ma et al.: Interpretation of Wavelet Analysis and its Application in Partial Discharge Detection \n(b) +-+ \nFigure 9. Wavelet patterns of the noise with the db2 wavelet. Sam- \npling frequency, 1GHz; data record, 2100 points. a, sinusoidal noise \nby broad frequency range between 100 kHz and 200 MHr; b, random \nnoise by white noise, \nThe present paper addresses two important and novel \nissues, which are missing from previous publications, re- \nlated to wavelet based denoising methods, i.e., optimal \nwavelet selection and automated thresholding to accom- \nmodate the typical PD pulses and representative forms of \nnoise with varying signal to noise ratio. The former has \nbeen addressed in the previous section, whereas this sec- \ntion presents an automatic level-dependent thresholding \ncriterion which can be used to separate PDs from \u201cnoise\u201d \nby means of characteristic patterns following the applica- \ntion of the DWT with the selected wavelets. \nThc coefficient distributions of two types of noise have \nbeen examined against a PD pulse. The first was continu- \nous sinusoidal noise with very broad frequencies between \n100 kHe and 200 MHz. Its wavelet pattern, as demon- \nstrated in Figure 9a, decays asymptotically, in a significant \nway, with the increment of decomposition level. Secondly, \nthe wavelet signature of stochastic noise given by white \nnoise has the form shown in Figure 9b. In this case, the \naverage density of coefficients is inversely proportional to  \nthe dyadic scale 1\/2\u2019 ( j  is the decomposition level), or, \nhalf the number of coefficient extremes do not propagate \nfrom one scale 1\/21 to a coarser scale 1\/2\u2019+\u2019 [201. In sin- \ngularity terms in signal processing, its Lipschitz exponent \nis negative. \nAs described above, PD signals and noise present dif- \nferent wavelet patterns, thus enabling PD feature extrac- \ntion. For a given set of PD data in the presence of noise, \nthe denoising can be performed through wavelet decom- \nposition, thresholding of wavelet coefficients and wavelet \nreconstruction. Thresholding is of vital importance during \ndenoising, which is conducted by retaining the wavelet co- \nefficients associated with discharge events and, on the \nother hand, discarding all other discharge-free coeffi- \ncients which characterize noise. \nAn automatic level-dependent thresholding criterion \nand hard thresholding approach is recommended to be \napplied to both details across decomposition levels and \napproximations at the user-predefined maximal level of a \nsigndl following the FDWT. The former at level j is de- \nfined ass, mj\/0.6745* d m ,  where mj  is the esti- \nmated level-dependent median value and n, the level-de- \npendent length of the signal. As can he seen from this \nthresholding estimator which considers the coefficient \nfluctuation at each decom osition level, both the basic \nthreshold estimate -*log( n j )  and the rescaling factor \nmJ0.6745 are level dependent, thus facilitating the most \neffective suppression of indeterminate noise. \nHard thresholding processes the data in such a way that \nthose wavelet coefficients whose absolute values are \ngreater than the threshold are kept and those less than \nthe threshold are replaced by zero, as can he expressed \nmathenlatically as y = x * ( I  x I > A), where n, y are origi- \nnal and retained coefficients respectively and A the \nthreshold value. Unlike the hard thresholding, soft thresh- \nolding shrinks the kept coefficients as can he seen from \nthe thrcsholding rule y = sign(x)*( 1 x 1 - A). Hard thresh- \nolding was preferred by the authors in PD denoising due \nto the higher coefficient values associated with discharge \nevents being kept thus yielding an improved PD signal to \nnoise ratio in comparison with software thresholding. \nMore information on the thresholding rules can be refer- \nenced in [6,211. \nConsider now the efficiency of wavelet analysis in the \ndenoising of signals containing partial discharges from \nsome examples. Two sets of PD pulse sequences, one with \n.5 individual DEP-type pulses and the other with 5 DOP- \ntype pulses, were immersed in electrical noise constituting \nvarious forms of electromagnetic radiation (both sinu- \nsoidal and stochastic), and recovery implemented. As \nshown from Figure 10, the db2 wavelet yields an effective \ndenoising result when adopted in the DEP-type PD ex- \ntraction. The frequency spectra of such DEP-type pulses \nand the superimposed noise are illustrated in Figures lob, \nand 10c, respectively. The correlation coefficient y he- \ntween the separated PD signal and the original one has a \nvalue of 0.890, indicating the great similarity between them \nin nature, and the relative error in amplitude between \nthem is within only 2%. However, for the DOP-type PD \nextraction, dh7 wavelet yields a better denoising result, as \nshown in Figure 11 as an example. By observing Figures \nI l h  and l l c ,  it can be seen that the frequency spectra of \nDOP-type pulses and the superimposed noise partially \noverlap around the resonant frequency of such DOP-type \nIEEE Transactions on Dieleclrics and EIectricaI InsuIation VoI. 9, No. 3, June 2002 453 \nBoos \nE \n(c,o 10 IM 150 250 100 I10 ua 450 \niWFnqurnry (MH1 \n3 r ,  I , , , I I ,  , , ,  \n0 02 0.4 06 08 I I 2  1.4 I K  IU 2 \n(4 ?me(&*) \nFigure 10.

However, this kind of resonant PD pulse can still \nbe separated from the combined electrical noise using the \nproposed denoising method. In this case, the denoising \nresult shows the value of y is high at approximately 0.95, \nand the relative error in amplitude is down to 4%. \nSimulation studies showed that the denoising of both \nDEP-type and DOP-type PD pulses for narrowband sinu- \nsoidal noise is more efficient than that for wideband \nstochastic noise. As the DEP-type pulse has a wideband \nfrequency spectrum, when the narrowband sinusoidal \nnoise is superimposed on the DEP-type pulses, they can \nbe identified from the coarsest approximations at maximal \nlevel and the details along decomposition levels which \nrepresent the specific frequency band involved in a signal. \nIn the case of the narrowband DOP-type pulses superim- \nposed by narrowband sinusoidal noise, the local irregular- \nities of tlie signal are dominated by PD data when sam- \npled with a suitable resolution, which can be detected from \nthe details at lower levels following the FDWT. However, \nthe denoising quality deteriorates gradually with the in- \ncrement of the frequency spectrum range that the PD sig- \nnals and noise overlap. This method is less efficient in \nsuppressing stochastic noise from both types of PD pulses \nwhen the signal to noise ratio is less than -3dB due to \n.orL I I I I  I I, 4 \no 50 iw 19 MO 1 s ~  yo is0 rm \n(d) Tmr (PSI \nFigure 11.

The greater the damping coefficient and interval \nbetween pulses, the better the result in terms of PD event \ndenoising. For the sampling frequency f, utilized, the \nhigher the f,, the higher the wavelet decomposition level \nrequired in order to achieve the same efficiency for PD \ndenoising, since a longer original sequence is available with \nthe increment off ,  within a fixed time period. \nFurther evidence of the power of this technique is illus- \ntrated in Figure 12. In this case, partial discharge signals \nwere acquired from a cable component energized at 5 kV \nin the presence of significant electronic noise and corona. \nThe wavelet with higher order, dblO, was chosen in this \nanalysis, since an RLC detection circuit with a resonant \nfrequency of 260 kHz was utilized in the measurements. \nBy inspection of Figure 12b, three pulses appear at the \ntime instants 0, 63 &s and 100 ps, respectively. By inspec- \ntion of Figure 12a, the PD pulses at 0 and 100 &s might \nhave been surmised, but clearly not that at 63 ~ s .  Hence, \nthe wavelet based denoising method is clearly successful \nin extracting the ?D pulses from the noise. \n454 Ma et al.: Interpretarion of Wavelet Analysis and its Application in Partial Discharge Detection \n6 t '  ' ' ' 1  ' ' ' ,  ' ' .I ' 1 1  \n(b) Tim 64 \nFigure 12.

Sampling frequency, 10 MHz; data \nrecurd, 2048 points. a, detccted original PD data; b, separated PD \npulses. \nTo further evaluate the performance of this denoising \ntechnique, the PD H,(+,q) patterns generated by using \nthe original data without any processing, by using a \nthreshold technique and the wavelet denoising technique \nare presented here for the test on the cable component. \nThe sampling frequency utilized in this test was 2.5 MHz \nobtaining 5 X lo4 points for each data record with respect \nto a complete ac power cycle of 50 Hz. Each PD pattern \nwas generated with 100 data records as acquired by the \nabove narrow-hand detection system during a measure- \nment duration of 10 min. The PD pattern shown in Figure \n13a is dominated by the noise where the original data are \ndirectly used to produce the pattern. Figure 13h gives the \nPD pattern by using a threshold technique applied to the \noriginal data where the noise level is estimated as 2 times \nof the standard deviation value of the acquired data. Fig- \nure 13c gives the PD pattern based on the wavelet-based \nnoise suppression. It is evident the wavelet denoising \ntechnique not only has eliminated the noise but also de- \ntected more PD activity with low apparent discharge mag- \nnitude, and is thus much more unambiguous and effective \nin characterizing the nature of the discharges in this par- \nticular PD geometry. \nThe time using a standard Pentium 3 to  denoise a sig- \nnal consisting of 2048 points illustrated in Figure 12 is \n0.2 s. The time needed to denoise such a data stream of \n5 x lo4 in generating PD patterns is around 1.5 s, giving a \ngood result potentially for on-line dkagnOStiCS or quality \nassurance of power equipment. Another attractive benefit \ncoupled to this method is data compression of PD mea- \nsurement data.

The detailed experimental setup can be \nfound in [22]. In this case, A ,  is a point on the end wind- \ning of the first turn of a coil, A ,  the same point one turn \naway from A , ,  and A ,  two turns distant from A , .  \nIn the case of motors, generators and transformers, par- \ntial discharge detection and interpretation is often ham- \npered by the distorting effect on the PD pulse due to the \ndistributed impedance of the windings as the pulse propa- \ngates from its site of origin to the measurement terminals. \nHowever, its wavelet pattern of a signal created by the \ncontinuous wavelet transform (CWT) offers the possibility \nof improving the characterization of the pulse propaga- \n.tion and providing better insight into the mechanism of \npropagation since it contains unique and cnhanced infor- \nmation compared with traditional methods in both the \ntime and frequency domains [231. \nAs is well known, thc factor u in the CWT, as described \nin equation (4), can be varied in either linear or dyadic \nscaling depending on the frequency component contained \nin the signal undcr examination and the required fre- \nquency resolution. Here, the scaling factor a is varied in \nlinear increments so that the CWT can provide a finer \nwavelet pattern view through the entire time-frequency \ndomain. In the CWT, the relationship between the scale \nand frequency can he understood in the following proce- \ndures. If a mother wavelet has a centra! frequency of \nw&n where wo is defined as wC, = j w  1 $ ( w )  I \u2019 d w ,  the \ncentral frequency created by $(a t )  as shown in equation \nVol. 9, No. 3, June 2002 455 \n(3) becomes w&na). Furthermore, the frequency f, at \nscale a corresponding to the sampling frequency f, of the \noriginal signal is then given by f, = (f,wo)\/(2rru). \nConsider now the wavelet choice suitable for the time- \nfrequency analysis of a PD pulse propagating along the \nwinding. To detect the local edges or sharp transitions in \na signal, which are defined as singularities, the wavelets \nwith some vanishing moments are crucial. The wavelets \nwith k vanishing moments satisfy the condition \n\/;\u2019$(t)dt = 0, (9) \nwhere j is positive integer j < k.  The modulus maxima of \nthe CWT coefficients of f ( t )  yielded with such $ ( I )  are \ngiven hy \n(10) I W # f ( i ,  h )  I s \nwhere A is a constant and a the Lipschitz exponent which \nis used to measure the singularity of a signal f ( r )  at time \ninstant b. The Lipschitz exponent a gives an indication of \nthe differentiability of f(0 more precisely, for example, \nthe a of a Dirac signal is estimated as 0, and the a of a \nsignal which is differentiable at time b is measured as 1. \nTo estimate a signal with a Lipschitz exponent up to k ,  \nthe wavelet selected should have k vanishing moments. \nHowever the number of CWT coefficient maxima at a \ngiven scale often increases linearly with the numbcr of the \nvanishing moment of the wavelet [ZOI. Therefore, the \nwavelets suitable for the PD pulse propagation applica- \ntion are those with as few vanishing moments as possible \nbut with enough moments to detect all sharp transitions \nthat are of interest in  this field. \nThe dh2 wavelet with 2 vanishing moments is chosen \nhere to illustrate the wavelet pattern of PD pulses de- \ntected at different points along the winding. Figures 14b \nto 14d display the wavelet patterns of the pulses shown in \nFigure 14a following the CWT with db2 wavelet. The en- \nergetic wavelet coefficients cover the active frequency \ncomponents up to around 20 MHz and the time range of \n0-600 ns. Clearly, the wavelet pattern can reveal explicitly \nnot only the dominant frequencies involved in the signal \nunder examination but also the time instants when they \nappear. \nA \u201ctraveling wave\u201d on the copper of the winding is \ndominantly present during the propagation of this pulse. \nThe further thc detection point from the injection point, \nthe progressively wider in shape and lower in magnitude \nthe pulse observed, since high frequency components are \nseriously attenuated when the pulse propagates from its \norigin site to the measurement point.

Does the wavelet pat- \ntern improve the time-flight method for inferring the orig- \ninal PD site? This will be addressed below in terms of the \nlocal maxima lines of the wavelet coefficients in the direc- \ntion of the scale. The local maxima line is defined in this \ncontext as a continuous curve in the wavelet domain along \nwhich all points are modulus maxima [ZO]. The singulari- \nties in an irregular signal indicate the onset of the sharp \ntransients, the timing of which is of interest for locating \nthe transient onset especially resulted from the comhina- \ntion of the \u201ctraveling wave\u201dand \u201ccoupling wave\u201d. In order \nto minimize the amount of computation, the dbl  wavelet \nwith only one vanishing moment is chosen as the analyz- \ning wavelet for locating the singularities in time. Figure \n15a illustrates a two-dimensional wavelet pattern of the \nPD pulse at point A ,  in the time-scale domain where the \nscales are selected within 80. Figure 15b shows the kept \nlocal maxima lines in the same wavelet domain by apply- \ning a predetermined threshold h = p max( I W$a, b )  I ) to \ntruncate other local maxima lines whose amplitudes are \nlower than this threshold, where p is a turning factor with \na value between 0 and 1. As can be seen from the local \nmaxima lines, the \u201ccoupling wave\u201d and the \u201ctraveling \nwave\u201d appear at time instants 0.215 ys and 0.417 ys, re- \nspectively. The \u201ccoupling wave\u201d arrives almost instantly \ndue to a stray field formed in the dielectric media in which \nenergy is coupled to the neighbouring conductors, the ar- \nrival time of which depends on the physical distance being \ndivided by the approximate speed of light.

Therefore \nthe arrival time difference between the \u201ctraveling wave \nand the \u201ccoupling wave\u201dcan he used to calculate the dis- \ntance between the detection point and the origin site of \nthe PD pulse. Table 2 gives the arrival time of such two \npropagation modes in the waveforms acquired at points \nA , ,  A ,  by which the original PD pulse site can be in- \nferred. In this case, the velocity of the traveling wave in \nthe induction motor winding is around 120m\/ys, and the \nelectrical distances (conductor length) of points A , ,  A ,  \nwith respect to pulse injection point A ,  are 2.42 m and \n4.84 m respectively [22]. It demonstrates that the error in \ndistance is within 3% hut it increases with the distance of \ndetection point, due to the amplitude decrement of the \nPD pulse along the winding. \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nAVELET transforms can reveal enhanced and reli- \nnals. The WT is capable of locating time and frequency \ncomponents simultaneously allowing the analysis of sig- \nnals with irregular and transition features, such as in the \ncase of partial discharges. The scaling factor selected in \nthe WT can be varied in either linear or dyadic scaling \ndepending on the frequency component contained in the \nsignal under examination and the required frequency res- \nolution. \nTo use wavelet theory for PD analysis, it is vital to se- \nlect the most appropriate wavelet and this is determined \nby the nature of the PD pulse. The correlation coefficient \nbetween the wavelet and the measured PD pulse can be \nused as an efficient criterion to evaluate the optimal \nwavelet for the measured PD pulse. For PD data acquired \nwith a R C  detector circuit, the optimal wavelets are those \ndyadic orthogonal wavelets of lowcr order, whereas for PD \ndata obtained with a RLC detector circuit, those dyadic \northogonal wavelets of higher order are preferred. \nBased on the patterns of the coefficient distribution of \nthe PD pulses and noise following the WT, denoising \nproblems can be solved. Further tests on practical PD data \nobtained on-site will confirm its power. \nBecause only a convolution calculation is involved in the \nimplementation of the FDWT, the algorithm may be po- \ntentially applied for on-line PD detection in the presence \nof severe electrical disturbance. Furthermore, the possibil- \nW \u2019  able information \u2019 contained in partial discharge sig- \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Val. 9, No. 3, June 2002 457 \nities for data compression that accompanies the wavelet- \nbased method alleviate the problems related to data stor- \nage and data communication during on-line PD detection. \nThe technique employing the local maxima lines of the \nPD pulse following the CWT provides the potential for \nlocating the original site of a PD pulse propagating along \nthe winding more accurately. However, studies have shown \nthat this application depends on the wavelet choice, the \nscale range selected and the turning factor for threshold- \ning, therefore it is application dependent and needs to he \nfurther justified. \nThe present effort of this paper has been devoted to \nfinding wavelets from the extensive libraries of mother \nwavelets based on the clear understanding of the test \nspecimen and the detection system utilized. Provided the \nbehavior of the detection circuit being utilized is fully \ncharacterized and understood, as is the case in these stud- \nies, there should be no need to adopt an adaptive wavelet \napproach. However, if the PD data set is non-stationary in \nthe measurement, an adaptive wavelet should be consid- \nered to automatically adjust the shape of the analyzing \nwavelet to the signal of interest. All of these show there is \nstill a lot of work to he done in this area, hut it holds very \nsignificant promise for the future. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions \nfrom Dr. B.
