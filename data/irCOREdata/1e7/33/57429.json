On 20th May 2006 intense rainfall on the Caribbean \nisland of Montserrat generated devastating flash floods and the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano \nexperienced a large dome collapse. The floods had very high loads of volcanic debris (lahars), \nunusually high water levels and were the first to transport boulders to the shoreline of the \nBelham Valley. Detailed knowledge of rainfall and geomorphological change, coupled with \n 2\nthe precise timing of events and eyewitness accounts has enabled us to assess the relative \nimportance of rainfall volume and intensity, volcanic debris and vegetation damage for the \nbehaviour of this and subsequent sediment-laden floods in this setting. We conclude that \nrainfall intensity and volume are not the critical control on the impact of flash floods in the \nBelham catchment but that changing runoff behaviour (controlled by vegetation damage and \ntephra fall) is critically important.     \n \n 3\n  \n Sediment-charged flash floods are hazardous and capable of significant infrastructure \ndamage because they are a) difficult to predict; b) often rapid; c) locally erosive, and d) \ntransport large sediment loads including boulders and other debris. Montserrat is a small \nisland in the Lesser Antilles with a bimodal rainfall season with peaks around May and \nOctober. The eruption of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano which started in July 1995 has been \ndominated by the extrusion of highly-viscous lava forming a series of lava domes inside the \npre-existing English\u2019s Crater1. The eruption has been punctuated by episodes of dome-\ncollapse and occasional vulcanian explosive activity, all of which have perturbed the upper \nparts of several river catchments. The catchment of the Belham River (area 12.9 km2) drains \none flank of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano and has tributaries draining St George\u2019s and Garibaldi \nhills and the Centre Hills (Fig. 1). Stream flow only occurs during, and for short periods after \nrainfall. Before the onset of the volcanic eruption in 1995, the catchment was densely \nvegetated with a diverse tropical flora and small-scale agricultural clearance. Although the \nclimate has not detectably changed since 1995, flash floods have become a significant \nhazard2.  \nThe volcanic-dome collapse on 20th May 2006 was the second largest in the 12-year \neruptive history and c. 115 \u00d7 106 m3 was removed from the edifice in less than three hours \nwith most activity taking place within 35 minutes (3; www.mvo.ms). The associated lahar \nactivity caused more geomorphic change in the Belham Valley (Fig. 1) than observed on any \nother individual day since 1995. In two days (20th and 21st May) more change occurred within \nthe valley than the cumulative total of the preceding five years (Fig. 2). \nIn this setting, the potential controls on flash flood behaviour are: (a) the relative \ntiming, intensity and distribution of rainfall; (b) the timing, distribution and character of \ncoarse volcanic debris deposition; (c) the timing, character and distribution of tephra fallout, \n 4\nand (d) the timing, character and spatial pattern of damage to vegetation (de-vegetation, plant \nmortality, leaf removal, branch breakage etc.). The system responds to changes in these \nvariables by altering discharge, flow depth, channel characteristics (width, depth, form, slope, \nbedforms) and the deposited sediment grade. All of these have an influence on the potential \nhazard in the valley. Observations of events on 20th May 2006 and subsequent changes to the \nsystem, in the context of a longer term study of the Belham Valley [2, 4, 5] are used here to \nassess the most important variables responsible for controlling the dramatic changes observed \nin the mid- and lower valley and thus the important controls on the variation in character of \nthese sediment-charged flash floods.        \n  \nMethods \nData have been compiled from a continuous rainfall record, eyewitness and \nMontserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) observations during 20th and 21st May, and field \nwork (including sedimentological mapping, sampling, photographic and GPS surveying) \nbefore and after the flash floods. All of the times recorded in this paper are Montserrat Local \nTime (GMT-4:00). A network of tipping bucket rain gauges has been operating continuously \non Montserrat since January 2001 5 even though volcanic ash accumulation on the tipping-\nbucket gauges affects their operation. In May 2006, the Harris, Garibaldi Hill (GAR) and \nMVO North (MVN) gauges were functioning (Fig. 1) and a fixed bucket gauge at Hope \nprovided daily totals. Volcanic activity recorded by the MVO provides timings for the \neruption on May 20th 2006. Channel bed and tephra fall samples were analyzed for grain size \nwith a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 and for composition by XRF. \nThe streams were not gauged, so velocity and discharge are estimated indirectly. \nAssuming 30 mm of rain fell over the whole catchment on the 20th May and 17 mm on the \n21st May, the upper limit of runoff volume was 3.87 \u00d7 105 m3 and 2.19 \u00d7 105 m3 respectively. \n 5\nIf all of the water on the 20th ran off at a constant rate between 03:00 and 09:00 then the \ndischarge would have been 17.9 m3s-1.  Seismic data and eyewitness reports suggest the \nhydrograph was strongly peaked and possibly multi peaked. Peak discharge of c.200\u2013300 m3s-\n1 in the lower valley is estimated from channel cross-section data with maximum water \nelevation assessed from strand lines, vegetation damage and deposits, combined with velocity \nestimates calculated from critical shear stress for bed load transport and wavelengths of \nstationary wave trains. \n \nCritical Observations \nThe weather on Montserrat in May 2006 was not unusual \nOn 20th May 2006, rainfall totals at MVN and Hope gauges (Fig. 3, 4) were 28.4 mm \nand 52 mm respectively and 27.4 mm fell before the GAR gauge stopped recording (intensity \nreached 1 mm\/min). The Hope value is more representative for the catchment because the \nGAR gauge clogged with ash and the MVN gauge is 2.5 km further north. Relatively little \nrain fell after the dome collapse. After 18:30 on the 21st, 31.5 mm were recorded at Hope but \nonly 17 mm at MVN. Spatial variation in rainfall intensity is such that individual gauges may \nnot always record the peak intensity or maximum volume5. Assuming that the recorded \nrainfall is representative of the events, the totals and intensities on 20th and 21st May 2006 \n(Fig. 3a) were not exceptional for the catchment. They are comparable to many other \nlocalised convective rainfall events (representative examples shown on Fig. 4). This rainfall \npattern does not explain the high flood magnitude or impact.  \nVery little rain fell in the preceding weeks; 1 and 1.2 mm was recorded at GAR and \n7.4 and 1.4 mm at MVN on 12th and 15th May respectively. On 19th May, 3.8 mm was \nrecorded at GAR, 0.6 mm at MVN and none at Hope. Thus exceptional flood behaviour on \nthe 20th was not caused by unusual antecedent rainfall. \n 6\nThe succeeding rainy season (June to November) was also unexceptional with \nmonthly totals not significantly different from the 2001-2007 average. Several events \nexceeded the daily total recorded on 20th May (e.g. Fig. 4) but the extreme flood behaviour \nwas not repeated. \n \nVolcanic activity on 20th May 2006 \nDome collapse began at about 05:52, coinciding with peak rainfall intensity recorded \nat Garibaldi Hill3. Ash plumes drifted to the west and northwest depositing ash and lapilli \n(Fig. 3). Tephra fallout rate declined towards the end of the dome collapse at 09:00, although \nvery light ash fallout continued locally until about 16:00. The ash fallout over the Belham \ncatchment between 05:52 and 07:32 was water-saturated, and accretionary lapilli were \nobserved at MVO between 07:32 and 08:07 implying moisture in the ash cloud3. The last \nmajor collapse (at c. 08:35) generated grey ash but later (until c. 16:00) distinctively red ash \nfell, sourced from a vent inside the crater. The thickness of the 20th May tephra deposit varied \nover the Belham Catchment (see Fig. 1B). \nOn 21st May, accretionary lapilli fell across the whole island. In the upper Belham \ncatchment, the 21st May tephra was of the order of 10 mm thick. Data from XRD analysis of \nBelham catchment ash samples matched plagioclase (Ca, Na, Al and Si) as well as cristobalite \n(SiO2), with no indication of any clay minerals in samples deposited in May 2006. \n \nThe fluvial events and deposits of the 20th and 21st May 2006  \nSome flow may have occurred in the valley between 03:08 and 04:47 on 20th May, \nwhen there was heavy rainfall (coincident with some ash venting). By 05:32, water was \nflowing rapidly down shallow sub-channel(s) in the lower Belham Valley and a light fall of \nash was occurring (eyewitness accounts and time-stamped photographs). The sustained \n 7\nrainfall recorded at Garibaldi Hill from 05:48 to 06:15 was accompanied by the onset of noisy \nflow in the Belham Valley. Lahars were heard by MVO staff and detected on the seismic \nnetwork from about 05:52. Eyewitnesses described buildings engulfed by the flowing water to \nroof height by c. 08:00 with large boulders \u201cbouncing downstream\u201d in lower reaches and the \nash-laden rain \u201clike thick chocolate falling from my roof\u201d.  By 09:00 significant flow had \nceased, with only some shallow turbid-water flow. At 13:00 the valley floor was wet but with \nlittle stream flow. Thus discharge varied rapidly through the day (Fig. 3) with peak discharge \nestimated at 200-300 m3s-1. \nRain fell over the whole catchment. Tephra were added to the flow by direct fallout \nand by entrainment in the rapid runoff. This with bed and suspended load added to the bulk \ndischarge. The flow transported large volumes of sediment including boulders throughout the \nsystem. Sedimentary mapping indicated that the flow \u201cbulked up\u201d with coarse sediment in the \nmid-reaches by eroding up to 3 m of post-1995 deposits from the valley floor (e.g. seen at the \nSappit confluence, Fig. 1). Although there was net valley floor lowering upstream of the \nbridge site on the 20th May, a sandy-gravel or gravely-sand bed up to a few 100 mm thick, \nwith isolated and clusters of boulders (diameter to >1.5 m) was deposited on scour surfaces \n(Fig. 5).  \nDownstream of the old bridge site, there was aggradation across the full width of the \nvalley floor (c. 200 m) on the 20th May and the channel bed aggraded by c. 1.5 m (decreasing \ndownstream).  A sheet of gravelly sand and sandy gravel was deposited with large numbers of \nboulders. The shoreline advanced seawards by up to 100 m, with at least 90 000 m3 of new \ndelta prism volume. The delta was strewn with woody debris and boulders. Eyewitnesses \nsuggest that boulders arrived at distal sites late in the event and this might explain the \nincreased noisiness of the flow. Large boulders had not previously been transported by the \n 8\nBelham River to the delta. The net result of these changes was a decline in valley slope in \nmid- and lower sections. \nAt the lowest end of the Belham Valley, the valley floor was draped with up to 0.3 m \nof water-lain sediment with grain size distribution (d50 41 \u03bcm, mean 34 \u03bcm) indistinguishable \nfrom the tephra deposits in adjacent areas. X-Ray diffraction analysis only shows primary \nvolcanic minerals and no secondary or accessory clay in these deposits. The final waning-\nflood deposits in this area were distinctly red and could only have been sourced from ash \nfallout derived from late stage venting in the crater.  \nThe rainfall was less intense on 21st May and less tephra fell on the Belham \ncatchment. The catchment was covered by the veneer of tephra deposited on the previous day. \nThe 21st flow had lower peak discharge than that on the 20th. Channel incision occurred \nthrough the mid reaches. The new channels were steep sided (Fig. 2d) and narrow by \ncomparison with the width of the flow on the 20th. They were eroded more than 2 m through \nthe 20th May deposits and down into older sediment. The channel depth decreased \ndownstream (depth c. 0.7 m, 300-500 m from the shore) to an area of net aggradation near the \ncoast. A sedimentary unit, up to 0.2 m thick, was deposited in parts of the lower valley.  \n   \nSubsequent floods and geomorphic evolution \nThe Belham Valley changed further through the subsequent rainy season. During June \nand July the channels were described as \u201cworsening\u201d but in August they started filling and by \nNovember had been filled to pre-May 2006 levels at many downstream sites. The channels \nfilled with gravelly-sand and sandy-gravel and the delta prograded a further c. 100 m. The \ncumulative result of the events in May-November 2006 was net shoreline progradation and \nnet aggradation (up to 3 m) at all points below the old bridge site (illustrated by profiles, Fig. \n 9\n1B). The aggradation between April 2005 and November 2006 was about the same as that in \nthe preceding five years. \n \nVegetation damage in 2006 \nVegetation cover affects runoff, influencing flood response time and peak discharge. It also \ndirectly controls sediment entrainment on hill slopes and channel banks. Before the eruption \nbegan in 1995, the whole Belham catchment was densely vegetated but volcanic activity had \nremoved all vegetation from the upper 18% of the Belham catchment by end 2005.  From \nFebruary 2006 and particularly in April-May 2006, high volcanic emissions of HCl and \nfrequent southerly winds, caused acid rain over the Belham catchment and this had caused \nwidespread damage to vegetation by 20th May. On 20th May, ash fallout blanketed vegetation \nwith increasing intensity between 05:20 and 07:32 burying low-growing plants. Very intense \ntephra fallout between 07:32 and 08:07 broke saplings and tree branches. Wet ash coated and \nadhered to leaves and this would have generated hydrochloric and sulphuric acid, accounting \nfor the increased leaf damage over subsequent days (Fig. 2d). After the 20th May collapse, the \narea of the catchment over which vegetation was damaged (browned, lacking leaves) was 5.87 \nkm2 (45.5 % of the total area), and the area of total vegetation clearance had risen to 2.97 km2 \n(23% of the total). Thus 68.5% of the catchment had no vegetation or significantly damaged \nvegetation. Changed wind direction and associated changes in distribution of acid rain in June \nallowed significant re-growth over much of the catchment (Fig. 2b and c). By the end of the \nyear re-growth had reduced the de-vegetated area to 2.6 km2 (20.2% of the catchment area) \nand there was re-growth over all of the damaged area.  \n \nSynthesis of Observations \nThe 20th May 2006 flow was very different from those through most of the 12 years \nsince onset of volcanic activity. The rainfall on the 20th was similar in intensity and magnitude \n 10\nto that on the 17th July 2006 and less than that on 19th July 2007 (Fig. 4). Despite this \nsimilarity, the estimated flow velocities and depths suggest that the discharge was less in July \n2006 and still less in July 2007. For comparison, on three days in 2004 when the rainfall was \ngreater than that on 20th May 2006 (Fig. 4) the peak discharges were lower and the flood \nimpact on valley morphology was far less (the total change between 2002 and 2005 was about \nthe same as that in 2006 alone). Thus, the peak discharge on 20th May 2006 was extreme even \nthough the rainfall was not out of the ordinary for this catchment. In none of the events before \nMay 2006 did boulders reach the shoreline.   \nGiven that the rainfall pattern was not unusual, other factors must have controlled the \nextreme flood behaviour on May 20th 2006. The relative importance of these factors is \ndiscussed here. Volcanic activity has four main impacts on catchments and flood behaviour; \n(a) topographic change, (b) coarse debris input to the upper catchment, (c) tephra fallout over \nthe catchment and (d) damage to vegetation.  \n(a) Topographic change in the Belham Catchment caused directly by the magmatic and \nvolcanic activity through 2006 was negligible on the catchment scale (only a small sub-\ncatchment drains the volcano\u2019s flank, Fig.1) and on its own, does not account for the variation \nin flood behaviour. The topographic changes resulting from erosion and deposition may be \nmore significant. These occur during runoff events with feedback between the flow and \nsediment movement. Rapid rill and gully development on de-vegetated and tephra-draped \nsurfaces increases runoff efficiency (cf. 2) and development of slot channels on the 21st May \ninfluenced transport efficiency. \n(b) Coarse-grade volcanic debris was not emplaced in the Belham catchment on the 20th \nMay 2006, debris from the dome collapse was deposited in adjacent catchments. Coarse grade \nsediment from earlier volcanic events may have had an influence, but we have not been able \nto identify such individual sediment slugs moving down the system. \n 11\n(c) Tephra were deposited over the whole catchment on the 20th and 21st May (Fig. 1B). \nTephra fallout (i) changes infiltration rate and runoff efficiency, (ii) adds sediment to the flow \nincreasing bulk discharge, and (iii) may alter flow rheology by changing load characteristics. \n(i) Infiltration rate on newly tephra-blanketed surfaces may be reduced by up to two \norders of magnitude6 leading to greater runoff. Although the 20th May tephra fallout would \nhave influenced infiltration, the total effect is unlikely to have been far in excess of other \ntephra falls in the 12 year eruptive history, therefore its influence on infiltration does not \naccount for the extreme flood behaviour on the 20th. \nThe 20th May tephra blanket would have increased the runoff efficiency on the 21st \nMay, and contributed to the tendency for channel incision. The influence of tephra on runoff \ndecreases rapidly with time after deposition such that by June and July rainfall events with \nvolumes and intensities similar to 20th May would have generated less runoff. \n(ii) Tephra entrained from the ground and falling onto the moving water surface add \nbulk to floods. On days when little or no tephra fall directly onto the flowing water, \nsuspended sediment concentration will vary with flow conditions as in other flash floods (e.g. \n7-8). In contrast, on 20th May 2006, a lot of tephra fell onto the flowing water surface, \ninjecting relatively fine-grade sediment directly into the water column. Given that the 20th \nMay tephra thickness varied from a couple of 10s mm to 100s mm over the catchment, it must \nhave added volume to the discharge. However the flow appears to have remained dominantly \nNewtonian, so it is unlikely that the sediment ever caused bulk discharge to increase more \nthan about 25% (cf. 9). Thus, although this sediment addition may have contributed to the \nhigh peak flood discharge on the 20th May, it cannot have been the main control on discharge. \n (iii) Tephra falling on flowing water adds sediment load irrespective of the capacity \nor competence of the flow. Grains take time to settle to the bed, thus the sediment load can be \nout of equilibrium with the flow and flow-bed composition. Such imposed increase in \n 12\nsediment load can influence flow behaviour. The proportion and composition of the ash is \ncritical to the resultant flow behaviour because very small changes in the percent of some \nminerals (notably clays) can significantly alter viscosity (e.g. 10-11). The effect in May 2006 \nis difficult to quantify as the fines content of the flow is not well-represented by the deposits \nand we have no samples from the flow. However, the ash was predominately plagioclase and \nno clay minerals were detected, so the effects of fines on viscosity would have been lower \nthan in documented in experiments with clay10-11. \nLarge volumes of ash did not fall until relatively late in the runoff event (Fig. 3). Thus \nthe early flow may have been relatively fines-poor. The final waning flow was evidently \nfines-rich and deposited silt across distal areas. Direct input of tephra to the flow evidently \nresults in a very different pattern of suspended sediment concentration than in other flash \nfloods; spikes would have been produced by the pulses in tephra fallout. \n(d) Vegetation was damaged over an unusually large area in the weeks leading up to 20th \nMay, whereas the increase in area of damage on the 20th was relatively small. Ash adhering to \nleaves increased the damage over subsequent days, but re-growth was then rapid through the \nyear. Vegetation clearance by, for example, wildfires increases water delivery to streams, \nreduces slope roughness, increases runoff speed (increasing peak magnitude), increases \nsediment flux and reduces response time (e.g. 8, 12, 13). The extensive vegetation damage \nwas a major contributor to the unusually high discharge on 20th May and during the \nsubsequent rainy season, although rapid re-growth reduced this affect through the year.  \n \nGeomorphological feedback  \nHydraulic processes, channel geometry and flow resistance are interdependent and given time, \na fluvial system adjusts to maintain continuity of water and sediment flux. A channel can \nrespond by aggrading, incising, changing width, form and slope. All these changes occurred \n 13\nin different parts of the Belham Valley at different times through 20th and 21st May.  In a \nflashy system such as the Belham Valley, a state of equilibrium is difficult to achieve and the \n20th May flow was an extreme disequilibrium event.  \nOn May 20th the system responded to high runoff rate and tephra input by changing \nthe transported grain size and channel slope, the former by movement of boulder-rich gravel \ndown the system (such that tephra represented only a small part of the sediment load) while \nthe latter changed by erosion, deposition and change in channel form. The relative importance \nof the imposed changes may be assessed simplistically by considering the stream power \nproportionality relationship for channels with mobile boundaries14 stated as 50dQQS s\u221d , \nwhere Q is channel forming discharge, S is energy gradient (approximating to channel \ngradient), Qs is bed material discharge and d50 is the median grain size. If the volcanic \nsediment input was the major control one might expect the channel slope to increase, whereas, \nif raised discharge were more important the expected response might be sediment coarsening \nand slope reduction, as observed on the 20th May. There was increased boulder transport over \na reduced valley slope in mid and distal reaches. Both the widespread vegetation damage and \nthe tephra deposition caused increased discharge. Although high discharge flows occurred in \nJune and July they did not cause so much impact as the 20th May flood, because that flood had \nalready modified the valley for higher discharge. Subsequent smaller flows were now strongly \nout of equilibrium with the channel form, slope and sediment distribution, and for example \nthe Belham River responded to the relatively smaller flows on the 21st May by channel form \nchange cutting narrow deep channels. \nWe have thus provided evidence that in this setting, rainfall intensity and volume are \nnot the critical control on the magnitude or impact of flash floods, changing runoff behaviour \nis. Vegetation damage was the primary control of changed runoff patterns with additional \neffects of tephra. These findings have important implications for hazard from sediment-\n 14\ncharged flash floods, demonstrating that high discharge and sediment yield events may be \ngenerated without extreme rainfall. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis research was largely funded by NERC Urgency grant NE\/E002900\/1.

Survey profiles along the centre line of the main channel of the Belham River from the old \nbridge site (BB on the map) to the shoreline. The main channel path did not substantially \nchange through this period, although at peak flow additional channels became active in the \nlower reaches. \n \n 15\nFig. 2. Photographs of the Belham Valley; A. and B. are aerial views of the same reach of the \nupper valley at Dyer\u2019s (E on Fig. 1A) taken on the evening of the 20th May 2006 (MVO \nphotograph; copyright NERC) and in November 2006 (photographer RH) showing the extent \nof tephra deposition and its later partial removal from e.g. roofs. The vegetation damage in \nMay was extreme and by November significant re-growth was evident. C. A small house \ntowards the lower end of the Belham Valley (A on Fig.1A) on 12th June 2006 (photographer \nTina Bretton). Notice particularly the >2 m boulders against the walls that were deposited in \nMay 2006 and the extent of vegetation damage still evident on the far valley side. D. View \nupstream at D on Fig. 1A on 23rd May 2006, (photographer SL; copyright NERC) shows the \nextent of vegetation damage on the hills and the channel incision into the 20th May and older \ndeposits. The house was well above the valley floor in 1995. \n \nFig 3. Diagram showing the relative timing of events on 19, 20th and 21st May 2006. A. \nCumulative rain fall data with timing of dome collapse and principle periods of tephra fall. \nThe rainfall line for GAR terminates mid graph as the rain gauge stopped registering data.  B. \nEstimated discharge. Although the timing of discharge is fairly well constrained the timing of \nthe peaks is not and the magnitude of the peaks are estimates only. The interference of the \ngreater peak later in the event on 20th results from the volume of noise made by the flow and \nthe timing of boulder mobilization in the lower valley.  C. The ash fall and vegetation damage \nlines are both illustrative with relative rates assessed from our eyewitness reports, and \ndiscontinuous data. The vegetation damage line includes representation of widespread damage \nbefore the dome collapse, the rapid damage on the 20th and continuation of damage after that \ndate.  \n \n 16\nFig . 4. A comparison of rainfall data from different rain gauges for the three days in May \n2006 and for six other days for which we have been able to calculate discharge estimates to \ndemonstrate the variations. The locations of the Hope and Garibaldi (GAR) gauges are shown \non Fig. 1A and the MVO North gauge is 2.5 km north of the catchment. Although both the \npeak intensity (indicated by line slope) and the total rainfalls were often greater than those \nrecorded on the 20th May 2006, the estimated discharges are all smaller (written above rainfall \nlines). The discharge estimates (given on right of graph in m3 s-1) are very approximate based \non interpretation of visual observations and interpretation of deposits. The 20th May 2006 \nGaribaldi line terminates as the gauge stopped working on that day. The Hope gauge (dashed \nlines) does not record intensities and the timings at this gauge are inaccurate but the data are \nincluded for comparison of totals. \n \nFig. 5.
