However, this poses a challenge\n*Educational Psychology, McGuffey Hall 100D, Oxford, OH 45056, USA. Email: dickeymd@\nmuohio.edu\n120 M. D. Dickey\nfor pre-service teacher education programs attempting to provide distance educa-\ntion. Traditionally, pre-service teacher education students become enculturated into\nan authentic practice by taking university classes and by participating in field experi-\nences in primary and secondary classrooms. Typically these experiences culminate\nin a student-teaching experience. However, this process changes with the use of\nWeb-based courses or programs, which may in many ways seem antithetical to this\nenculturation process. All too often, Web-based instruction is reduced to uninspir-\ning content presented in a linear text-based format (Daviault & Coelho, 2003).\nTransposed lectures and text-based content do little to model or enculturate pre-\nservice teachers into the practice of integrating technology for their future teaching\npractice. Yet, because cognitive apprenticeship methods foster the emergence of\npractical skills within an authentic setting, finding methods of integrating cognitive\napprenticeship methods in Web-based environments may provide an effective\nmeans to help enculturate pre-service primary through secondary teacher education\nstudents into the practice of integrating technology into their future teaching\npractices.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the integration of a cognitive apprentice-\nship model into an educational technology Web-based course for pre-service primary\nand secondary teacher education students in an American university. Specifically, this\nstudy presents an overview of methods, tools and media used to foster the integration\nof a cognitive apprenticeship model, and presents the types of barriers and enablers\nencountered when attempting to participate in a computer-mediated cognitive\napprenticeship. The goal of this study is to better understand the pragmatics, suitabil-\nity, affordances and constraints of integrating cognitive apprenticeship methods in a\nWeb-based distance education course for teacher education.\nTheoretical framework\nPre-service K\u201312 (primary and secondary) teacher education students are in the\nprocess of being educated within a field of practice. It is important to reinforce that\nnotion, yet difficult to achieve in Web-based courses. According to Brown et al.\n(1996), prior to the emergence of formal schooling, the apprenticeship model was the\nmost common means of educating learners in fields of practice. Cognitive appren-\nticeship methods consist of several stages (Collins et al., 1989). First the teacher iden-\ntifies and models the expert-level practices or strategies for learners. Next, the teacher\ndesigns \u2018scaffolds\u2019 that will support learners in their attempt to apply expert practices\nor strategies. The term scaffold as applied to teaching is used to describe the tempo-\nrary support framework provided to support learners in the process of extending\ncompetencies (Bransford et al., 2000). Scaffolding may take many forms and serve\nvarious functions. Hannafin et al. (1999) identified four types of scaffolding to\ninclude: conceptual, meta-cognitive, procedural and strategic. Conceptual scaffold-\ning provides learners with hints and recommendations. Meta-cognitive scaffolding\nhelps students plan, organize, reflect and regulate during an activity (Brown, 1998).\nProcedural scaffolding includes support that helps students to perform a task, action\nCognitive apprenticeship methods in Web-based educational technology 121\nor process. Strategic scaffolding provides supports that help learners in applying\nknowledge, principles and experiences to various and new situations. Scaffolding can\nbe provided in many forms and may include various resources and media. Although\nscaffolding is an important element, coaching is also an important part of cognitive\napprentice methods. Whereas scaffolding may be related to individual areas, the role\nof coaching is much broader with the purpose of overseeing the student learning\nprocess (Collins et al., 1991). The teacher coaches the students in the process of\nadopting and using the expert practices or strategies by offering guidance during the\nentire process and by critiquing performance and offering feedback throughout.\nWhile students are adopting and learning new practices, they are strongly encour-\naged to articulate their reasoning in using various strategies and practices. They are\nencouraged to reflect on their own experiences as well as those of their classmates.\nDuring this process the teacher gradually reduces or fades the support (coaching) as\nlearners move towards independently applying what they have learned to new chal-\nlenges. Because cognitive apprenticeship methods foster the emergence of practical\nskills within an authentic setting, it may provide an effective means to enculturate pre-\nservice primary and secondary teacher education students into the practice of\nintegrating technology into their future teaching practices. Cognitive apprenticeship\nmethods may be particularly well-suited for a Web-based environment for educa-\ntional technology because students must use educational technology to learn about\neducational technology.\nLiterature review\nThere have been several notable studies on the integration of technology and cognitive\napprenticeship methods (J\u00e4rvel\u00e4, 1995; Liu, 1998; Liu & Pedersen, 1998; Hendricks,\n2001; Liu & Hsaio, 2002), although relatively few explicitly investigate the use of\ncognitive apprenticeship methods in a Web-based environment. Research has been\nconducted about the integration of cognitive apprenticeship methods in the design of\nInternet-delivered online video case studies to support early literacy instruction for\npre-service teachers (Schrader et al., 2003). Although the distribution of the video\ncase studies was online, the course itself was taught in a traditional classroom format.\nThe findings of the study by Schrader et al. indicate that video case studies of best\npractices helped initiate conversation and allowed learners multiple perspectives. In\ncontrast, Saarenkunnas et al. (2000) investigated the integration of cognitive appren-\nticeship methods in the form of case-based conferencing for a Finnish and American\ncollaborative course for pre-service teachers. The underlying technology that\nsupported the collaborative course relied upon the use of both Web-based asynchro-\nnous conferencing tools and video conferencing. Although the focus of the study by\nSaarenkunnas et al. (2000) is primarily on the Web-based discussions, the findings\nindicate that the integration of cognitive apprenticeship methods did enhance learn-\ning. Both of these findings indicate value and potential for integrating cognitive\napprenticeship methods in Web-based instruction. It is also worthy to note that in\nboth the initiatives by Schrader et al. (2003) and Saarenkunnas et al. (2000), designers\n122 M. D. Dickey\nand researchers relied on the use of existing technologies such as digital video, video\nconferencing and discussion forums rather than developing new technologies for the\nintegration of cognitive apprenticeship methods for teaching and learning.\nAlthough there have been numerable studies of the integration of technology and\ncognitive apprenticeship methods (J\u00e4rvel\u00e4, 1995; Liu, 1998; Liu & Pedersen, 1998;\nHendricks, 2001; Liu & Hsaio, 2002), few of these studies have focused on the use\nof cognitive apprenticeship methods in a Web-based environment. As an increasing\nnumber of programs worldwide offer courses online, it is important to explore how\ninnovative methods such as the cognitive apprenticeship model can be integrated into\nonline learning environments to enhance teaching and learning. The purpose of this\nstudy is to investigate the integration of a cognitive apprenticeship model into an\neducational technology Web-based course for pre-service primary and secondary\nteacher education students in an American university by examining the methods,\ntools and media used to foster a cognitive apprenticeship model and to examine the\ntypes of barriers and enablers encountered during the process.\nMethodology\nThe methodological framework for this investigation is an interpretive case study\n(Merriam, 1998). The reason for choosing an interpretive framework for this study is\nto provide a better understanding of the technology affordances and constraints of\nWeb-based learning environments, and to generate analysis about the impact of tech-\nnology tools, media and methods for fostering a cognitive apprenticeship model in a\nWeb-based learning environment.\nSetting and content\nThis setting for this investigation is a Web-based technology integration course enti-\ntled Integrating Technology and Education Practicum (I-TEP). I-TEP is a one-\ncredit semester course for teacher education students of junior\/senior standing. The\nfocus of I-TEP is to model technology integration methods and strategies for pre-\nservice K\u201312 (primary through secondary) teachers. Currently I-TEP consists of five\nthematic modules. Each module focuses on both instructional design and the integra-\ntion of a technology tool to enhance learning. Modules include learning theories\n(cognitive apprenticeship model), communication tools (email, electronic mailing\nlists, Web logs, instant messenger, and discussion groups), presentation tools (the\nWeb, PowerPoint, graphic and audio software, and analogue and digital video),\nproductivity tools (databases, spreadsheets, word processors, and graphical organiz-\ners) and the Web. In each thematic module, students are assigned readings and\nexemplars to view. Students are then required to respond to the readings and exem-\nplars by using various communication tools (Web logs, email, instant messenger\ntools, etc.). Next, students complete assignments in which they design lesson plans\nintegrating a specific type of technology tool to enhance learning. Concurrently,\nstudents also produce educational media using the tool integrated in the lesson plan.\nCognitive apprenticeship methods in Web-based educational technology 123\nData collection\nThe data presented in this study were collected during the summer 2005 semester.\nObservation data were gathered from 42 students (three graduate and 39 undergrad-\nuate students) from 11 different teacher education licensure programs. All of the\nstudents in this study gave consent for participating in the study, and all participants\u2019\nnames have been changed to preserve anonymity. Additionally, 21 students partici-\npated in email interviews.\nFindings\nModeling: tools, media and methods\nCognitive apprenticeship methods were manifested and integrated in the Web-based\nenvironment in several ways. Modeling was supported through the use of text-based\nmodels and exemplars of lesson plans. Additionally, students were presented with\nmodels and exemplars of a variety of educational media created using various tech-\nnology tools. Modeling was also provided for fostering both skill and cognitive devel-\nopment through a series of digital videos and Flash animations and text-based\ninstructions called Over My Shoulder (OMS). The OMS media were not skill-based\ntutorials, but instead were designed to demonstrate internal processes the instructor\nwent through to create educational media. The OMS videos consisted of video\ncaptures of the instructor\u2019s computer screen while she created educational media\nusing a particular tool. The sound track consisted of the instructor using a \u2018think-\naloud\u2019 protocol to reveal the thought process in which the instructor engaged while\ncreating educational media. The videos and animations were specifically not skill\ntutorials because they purposefully included errors made by the instructor along with\narticulated problem-solving strategies the instructor used to overcome problems and\nerrors that occurred. For example, one assignment required students to create a\nWebQuest using their choice of Web-editing software. Students could select from a\nvariety videos or animations in which the instructor used the corresponding Web edit-\ning software (Macromedia Dreamweaver, Microsoft Frontpage, Netscape Composer,\netc.) to create a WebQuest.\nThe purpose of the OMS media was to allow learners look over the instructor\u2019s shoul-\nder and to see and hear the internal processes the instructor when through while creat-\ning educational media. The OMS Flash animations were similar, but instead of a sound\ntrack relied on thought balloons to articulate internal processes. The OMS videos and\nanimations purposely included some common mistakes and other problems encoun-\ntered while creating educational media. The instructor modeled and explained how\nshe dealt with problems and issues that occurred while working with technology. By\nwatching, listening and even following along with the videos and animations, students\nobserved the instructor modeling problem-solving and troubleshooting techniques\nwhile creating educational media with various technology tools. The purpose of the\nOMS media was to illustrate techniques and skills, but more importantly to model\nmethods and techniques for problem-solving while using technology tools.\n124 M. D. Dickey\nThe OMS media was also designed to provide various levels of scaffolding. The\nOMS videos provided the greatest amount of scaffolding through the use of both\nvideo and sound. The Flash animations offered less scaffolding. Learners could\nview the process, but instead of a soundtrack thought-balloons were used to articu-\nlate internal processes. The text-based instructions provided the least amount of\nscaffolding.\nEnablers.   All of the students enrolled in I-TEP had their own computers. The major-\nity of students in this study had broadband Internet access either from their homes or\nfrom locations in or near the university. The university provides discount pricing for\nbroadband Internet access for all students living on-campus and in the local town of\nthe main campus. Additionally, the university provides greatly discounted prices for\nstudents purchasing Microsoft Office software as well discount pricing for some\nMacromedia and Adobe products.\nThe OMS materials were offered in many formats. They were created in three file\nformats (Audio Video Interleave, QuickTime, and Macromedia Flash file format) to\naccommodate various Web browser plug-ins. Students had the availability of down-\nloading the compressed OMS materials from the course web site. Additionally,\nstudents could request a set of CDs, a DVD, or VHS tapes of all of the OMS videos\nand animations.\nBarriers.   Requests for CDs and DVDs of the OMS materials occurred throughout\nthe course. During the first week of the course, only five students requested CDs\nand one student requested a DVD of the OMS materials. However, as the course\nprogressed, more students began requesting copies due to the time it took to down-\nload the files. All of the videos on the course web site were compressed and none of\nthe students reported problems with expanding files; however, many reported\nhaving to a wait one or two hours while material was downloaded. Although initially\nthere were more requests for CDs than DVDs, by the end of the semester there was\nequal demand for copies in each format. There were, however, no requests for VHS\ntapes.\nDuring the span of the course, there were no reports of the course web site being\ninaccessible; however, occasionally some of the resource and reference web sites were\nunavailable. While occasionally a student would note this, none of the students\nreported this as a barrier to access. Instead, those students used the other resources\nprovided. Additionally, there were no reports of Internet or email access being prob-\nlematic during the time of the course. There were, however, eight more urgent reports\nof issues with accessing and\/or downloading the videos. Eight students complained\nabout the amount of time it took to download the media. It is interesting to note,\nhowever, that six of these complaints were expressed through email the evening\nbefore assignments were due. When these students were questioned as to whether this\nissue was a problem of access to technology or of time management, two stated that\ntime management was probably the cause. \nCognitive apprenticeship methods in Web-based educational technology 125\nI procrastinate a lot sometimes. (Mindy)\nI should have started sooner. (Carrie)\nThe other four students failed to respond.\nObservations of student performances through teacher\u2013student interactions\nrevealed that although students used all of the materials, the videos and animations\nseemed to have the most impact in modeling techniques and skills. During email\ninteractions, students often referenced a specific OMS video or animation. \n\u2026 in that section of the video when you added the picture. (Cara)\n\u2026 like the problem you had when you uploaded the webquest (sic) [referencing the video\nfor uploading a webpage]. (Scott)\nI did it the same way you did, but I must have made a mistake [referencing the video for\nuploading a webpage]. (Liz)\nThe OMS material was also the topic most discussed in student web-log postings\nand online interactions. In students\u2019 final reflections, many students seemed to\nstrongly associate the use of cognitive apprenticeship methods with aspects of model-\ning found on the OMS videos and animations. \nThe Cognitive Apprenticeship was very helpful when it came to these assignments. It was\neasy for me to follow and guided me along. (Sara)\nI like the idea of using cognitive apprenticeship methods. I know that I learn so much more\nfrom watching someone else model something before I attempt it. (Todd)\nI could watch someone perform the tasks to get an idea, but in order for me to realy [sic]\nlearn and remember, I need to work it on my own. (Beth)\nThere were no reported problems or barriers with file formats, nor did any students\nrequest assistance for downloading plug-ins. While most students worked on the\ncourse from home, at various times, several reported using computers on campus\nbecause of having a wider range of software available and faster computers.\nScaffolding and coaching: tools, media and methods\nScaffolding refers to the temporary support framework provided to learners to support\nthem in the process of extending competencies (Bransford et al., 2000). Within the I-\nTEP learning environment, scaffolding was provided in many ways. First, each of the\nfour thematic modules was designed to build upon skills learned in previous modules.\nThe level of instructional support was also designed to scaffold learners in an attempt\nto foster independence and risk-taking for students. Scaffolding was provided in the\ntype of assistance provided to students by the instructor. During the first two\nmodules, students\u2019 email requests for assistance were answered within a time span\nof 2\u201310 hours; however, as the course progressed, students were encouraged to seek\nother means for assistance. As each module progressed, the response time for\nemail requests for assistance became longer. For the final module, students had a 15\u2013\n24 hour delay in response. The purpose of imposing this delay was because, as future\n126 M. D. Dickey\nteachers, many of the students will need to find resources for problem-solving and\ntrouble-shooting technology problems. Extending response times encouraged\nstudents, particularly those students who tended to procrastinate on assignments, to\nsearch the Web to find immediate answers to questions.\nCoaching is part of the teacher\u2019s role within a cognitive apprenticeship environ-\nment. The role of the teacher is to coach students in the process of adopting expert\npractices and strategies by offering feedback, guidance and prompting when needed.\nWithin the I-TEP Web-based environment, coaching was provided using many\ndifferent strategies. First, email and instant messenger were used to answer initial\nquestions and help learners get acclimated to the learning environment. A Web-log\nalso provided a means of guidance and feedback. Because the course required\nstudents to create educational media, each student had access to their own individual\nonline Web folder. The instructor also had full access and privileges to each student\u2019s\nWeb folder. Students saved their work in this folder. As students created media and\nencountered problems, the instructor was able to look at look at the work-in-progress\nand prompt students and offer guidance.\nEnablers.   There were no reports of students being unable to access their email.\nStudents used email as the primary tool when requesting assistance, although a few\nstudents used Instant Messaging tools. Students received feedback via email and\nthere were no reports of students not receiving feedback. There were five students\nwho voiced complaints about timely responses to email on the due day of the first\nmajor assignment. However, the requests were sent two to three hours before the due\ndate and time of an assignment. Students were informed that email was answered in\nthe order in which it was received. When asked, all five admitted to procrastinating.\nIt is interesting to note that four students appeared to change their work habits and\nsubmitted subsequent work well before the final due date and time.\nAll student work was uploaded into student web folders. In one of the initial assign-\nments, students changed the permission settings on their web folder to allow the\ninstructor access. When students encountered problems, they emailed the instructor\nwho then could access the work and help coach the student in the problem-solving\nprocess.\nBarriers.   While email worked well for coaching, several students provided feedback\nat the end of the course recommending the use of a chat tool for synchronous coach-\ning. They felt the process might have been more effective if they could get immediate\naccess rather than using email; however, email was an important tool because it forced\nstudents to reflect and to at times seek alternative methods for problem-solving.\nBecause answers were not provided on-demand, students often had to rely on other\nmethods. In turn, this delay was part of the scaffolding process. Most K\u201312 teachers\ndo not have immediate access to on-demand technical problem-solving. It could be\nargued that the short delay many students experienced in an asynchronous environ-\nment helped foster new avenues for problem-solving.\nCognitive apprenticeship methods in Web-based educational technology 127\nExploration, reflection, articulation: tools, methods and media\nWithin a cognitive apprenticeship framework, learners should be encouraged to\nexplore new ideas and viewpoints, and to form hypotheses and test them (Enkenberg,\n2001). Exploration in the I-TEP learning environment was supported in several ways.\nLearners were presented with a wide variety of models and exemplars of lesson plans\nand corresponding educational media. They were encouraged to look at resources\ncritically and to reflect and articulate their ideas and thoughts to their Web-logs. At\nthe start of each module, learners were required to reflect upon their initial thoughts\nabout the topic of the module and their opinions of the relevance of the tool-type for\nteaching and learning. After the module activities, learners followed up with a final\nreflection. The purposes of the pre and post reflections were twofold. Because the\ncourse content focuses on both instructional design of lesson plans and skill develop-\nment, the reflections were used to foster students in becoming critical consumers of\neducational technology as well as to become aware of their learning processes while\ndeveloping technology skills.\nEnablers.   Because I-TEP is a general education course, materials had to be either\nvery general in nature so they would be relevant for students from a variety of teacher\neducation programs or they needed to be curriculum-centered with enough samples\nrelevant to each of the teacher education programs. In I-TEP, students were provided\nwith both. Generic samples where used to introduce concepts, then students were\nprovided with curriculum-specific examples to explore concepts related to their field.\nThere were no reports of a lack of relevant exemplars, artifacts and resources to\nexplore from students from any of the teacher education programs.\nSeveral of the technologies such as group blogs and reflection questionnaires\nenabled students multiple means of reflection and articulation. Additionally, because\nall student work was accessible via the Web, students could view each others\u2019 work,\nwhich further enhanced articulation among students.\nBarriers.   There were no reports of students not being able to access group blogs,\nreflective questionnaires or other students\u2019 work; however, there were five reports of\nstudents being unable to access resource web sites. This did not appear to cause much\ndifficulty because a variety of supplemental resources for each teacher education\nprogram had been provided.\nSummary\nOverall, the combination of tools, method and media outlined seemed to foster\ncognitive apprenticeship methods within a Web-based learning environment.\nHowever, it should be noted that this initiative represented a significant investment\nof time and energy for the instructor. Typically, faculty expect to invest time and\nenergy in developing curriculum, materials and resources for teaching; however, a\n128 M. D. Dickey\nWeb-based environment is much more time-intensive. The OMS videos, although\neasily created with Camtasia screen-capturing software, took a great deal of time to\ncreate. Additionally, the Flash animations also represent a significant time invest-\nment. Although the materials, web site, blog, questionnaires and Web-based curric-\nulum design were also time-consuming, the greatest investment of time was in\nteaching the course. Coaching and scaffolding along with supporting reflection and\narticulation can be significant in a traditional classroom; however, typically the radi-\ntional classroom is time-locked with a beginning and end to class time. In a Web-\nbased environment, there is no time-lock beyond those that a teacher imposes.\nWithout time-lock limits, coaching students can rapidly become an ongoing teaching\nexperience, which, although it is a great enabler for students, can rapidly become a\nbarrier for the teacher.\nDiscussion\nOne of the main concerns of educators teaching in a distance learning environment\nis the issue of access. Overall, there were few problems of access to most of the course\nmaterials. Although the various components of cognitive apprenticeship methods\nwere integrated throughout the course in various ways, the OMS materials were some\nof the most apparent elements of modeling. Because the video and animation were\nnot step-by-step \u2018how to\u2019 instructions, but rather were designed to illustrate and\ndemonstrate thinking process while creating educational media, the OMS materials\nwere an integral part of the course. Provisions such as options for downloading, a vari-\nety of file formats, and the availability of CDs and DVDs seemed to be an effective\nmethod for supporting the technique.\nIt is important to note that the participants in this study are students at a mid-sized\nliberal arts state university; however, the students at this university are predominantly\nfrom families in the upper-middle economic range. Most students had broadband\nInternet access. The selection of media in this study was based the technology access\nprovided by the university and based upon prior experience with this student demo-\ngraphic. It is acknowledged that the students in this study may not be representative\nof the broad spectrum of students in educational licensure programs. The choice to\npresent the course as a Web-based environment and the selection of media such as\nvideo and animation used in this study to support cognitive apprenticeship methods\nmay be a barrier for many students.\nObservations and students\u2019 reflections revealed that students found the OMS\nmaterials instrumental in modeling and used them as point of departure when\nrequesting assistance. These findings are somewhat consistent with findings of\nSchrader et al. (2003). Whereas Schrader et al. found that the use of video case studies\nof best practices helped initiate conversation and allowed for multiple perspectives,\nobservations and interactions with students in the I-TEP Web-based environment\nrevealed that the use of video and animation allowed students to experience different\nmethods of problem-solving\u2014and for many students it helped foster a sense of pres-\nence in a distributed learning environment.\nCognitive apprenticeship methods in Web-based educational technology 129\nThis is interesting to note because Collins et al. (1989) stress the importance of\nmodeling and coaching as methods of implementing cognitive apprenticeship meth-\nods. Jonassen (1999) argues that there are two types of modeling: behavioral model-\ning of overt performance, and cognitive modeling of covert cognitive processes.\nWhereas behavioral modeling focuses on psychomotor skills, cognitive modeling\ninvolves an externalizing of internal processes. The use of video and animation\nprovided students with both overt behavioral modeling of skills, but more importantly\nthe covert cognitive modeling of internal processes of decision-making and problem-\nsolving along with rationales for choices and options.\nConclusion\nThe span of the qualitative case study is by no means comprehensive, but rather is\nintended to examine both how methods and media can foster the integration of cogni-\ntive apprenticeship methods. However, it is not the purpose of this study to prescribe\nmethods for integrating cognitive apprenticeship methods in Web-based learning\nenvironments, nor to designate how an online course should be structured. Rather,\nthe findings of this study revealed that various media and processes could help foster\nthe integration of cognitive apprenticeship methods for a Web-based teacher educa-\ntion course. However, it should be noted that the applicability of these findings is\ncontext dependent. The students in this study had access to computer and Internet\naccess that supported the use of video and animations, email, instant messenger tools\nand other Web-based tools. The premise of this investigation is that the cognitive\napprenticeship model holds relevance for both modeling and the effective use of tech-\nnology for pre-service teacher education students as well as being a viable model for\nthe design of a Web-based learning environment.\nAcknowledgement\nThe preparation of the research was supported in part by the Research Center for\nEducational Technology Research Fellowship.
