The methods of formal asymptotics are used to examine the behaviour of a system\nof curvilinear vortices in a type II superconductor as the thickness of the vortex cores tends to zero.\nThe vortices then appear as singularities in the field equation and are analagous to line vortices in\ninviscid hydrodynamics.

Introduction. When a superconducting material is placed in an applied mag-\nnetic field of strength H0, the state it adopts is conveniently described by Fig. 1.\nHere is a material parameter which determines the type of superconducting mate-\nrial; n < 1\/xf describes what is known as a type I superconductor, and > 1\/v\ndescribes what is known as a type II superconductor.\nFor type I superconductors, if the magnetic field strength is sufficiently low, then\nthe field will be excluded from the interior of the material. (This is known as the\nMeissner effect.) If, however, the field strength exceeds the critical value He, then it\ncan no longer be excluded and the sample reverts to the normally conducting (normal)\nstate, with the field penetrating it fully.\nType II superconductors are characterised by the existence of a third state, known\nas the \"mixed state,\" in which there is a partial penetration of the magnetic field into\nthe superconducting material. The mixed state consists of many normal filaments\nembedded in a superconducting matrix. Each filament carries with it a quantised\namount of magnetic flux and is circled by a supercurrent vortex; thus these filaments\nare often known as vortices (see Fig. 2).\nIt is important to understand the behaviour of the superconductor while it is in the\nmixed state, since it is in this state that most superconductors appear in applications.\nThe motion of vortices is of particular interest, since this motion dissipates energy\nand generates an electric field, which in turn results in an effective resistivity for the\nmaterial.\nThe aim of this paper is to apply the methods of formal asymptotics to a system\nof curvilinear vortices in an unbounded superconductor in three dimensions for the\ncase of an extreme type II material (i.e., as the parameter oc). The vortices\nwill behave as singularities in the field equation, rather like line vortices in inviscid\nhydrodynamics. A local examination of each vortex core will then give a \"law of\nmotion\" for the evolution of these singularities.\nA similar analysis has been applied recently to two-dimensional (i.e., rectilinear,\nparallel) vortices by Peres and Rubinstein [12] and Dorsey [8]. We aim to gener-\nalise their results to three-dimensional curvilinear vortices. We note also the work of\nGor\u2019kov and Kopnin [11], which has some parallels with the present work.\nReceived by the editors February 25, 1994; accepted for publication (in revised form) September\n6, 1994.\nMathematical Institute, University of Oxford, 24-29 St. Giles\u2019, Oxford OX1 3LB, United King-\ndom.

Schematic diagram of the mixed state of a type II superconductor.\nThe model we work with is the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory proposed\nby Gor\u2019kov and Eliashberg [10]. In 2 we briefly present this theory and discuss\nthe steady two-dimensional vortex solution. In 3 we perform a formal asymptotic\nanalysis of a system of curvilinear vortices which are well separated (which will be\nmade more precise later) and derive the law of motion governing the evolution of the\nsystem. In 4 we consider a system of densely packed vortices. Finally, in 5, we\npresent our conclusions.\n2. The Ginzburg-Landau theory. For a complete introduction to the\nGinzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity the reader is referred to [4] and [7]\nand the references therein. Here we merely state the dimensionless, time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equations proposed in [10] as\n-)- (V iaA)2 P 0,\n(oA )() v\/ (v\/ A) o- + v + (*V V*)+ II2A,\nMOTION OF VORTICES IN TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS 1277\nwhere is the complex superconducting order parameter (with Il 1 representing\nwholly superconducting material and 0 representing wholly normal material),\ndenotes the complex conjugate of , and A and (I) are the real magnetic vector\npotential, and electric scalar potential, respectively, which are such that\n(3) H=VAA,\nOA(4) n Ot\nwhere H is the magnetic field and E is the electric field; A is unique up to the addition\nof a gradient; once A is given, (I) is unique up to the addition of a function of t. Here\nand cr are material constants; is known as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, while\nG is the dimensionless conductivity of the normal electrons in the material.\nLengths in (1)-(2) have been nondimensionalized with the penetration depth,\nwhich is a typical length associated with the variation of the magnetic field in the\nmaterial. Time has been nondimensionalized with the timescale associated with the\nrelaxation of (so that the coefficient of cgqy\/Ot in (1) is unity).\nIn the steady state, with (I) 0, equations (1)-(2) result from minimising the\nGinzburg-Landau formulation of the Gibbs free energy [9]; in the time-dependent\ncase they can be obtained as a limiting form of the microscopic BCS equations [1],\n[10] for certain materials. Note that, even though is complex, (2) is in fact real,\nso we have five equations in six unknowns. This degeneracy is due to the property\nof gauge invariance, which we shall return to in a moment. A sixth equation can be\nprovided by constraining the choice of gauge for A, for example by requiring that\ndiv A =0.\nEquations (1)-(2) exhibit vortex solutions, which can be illustrated by looking\nfor a solution of the form\n(5) f(r)eiN,\n(6) A A(r)eo,\nwhere N is an integer, r and 0 are cylindrical polar coordinates, and e0 is the unit\nvector in the azimuthal direction. We find that f and A are solutions of\nn2r dr r A- --gr f f3 f,\n(9) f, A bounded as r\n--\n0,\n(10) f\nBerger and Chen [3] have shown the existence of a solution for f and A for all N\nwhich necessarily has f(0) 0. The supercurrent is given by\n(11) j f2(A N) co,\n1278 S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN AND G. RICHARDSON\nwhich demonstrates the vortex-like behaviour. The axial magnetic flux through the\nvortex is\nf .ds- 27rN\nThus the flux is quantised and a single \"fluxon\" has magnitude 27r\/n.\nThe Ginzburg-Landau parameter n is generally small for pure metals but quite\nlarge for superconducting alloys. Peres and Rubinstein give typical values of s 235\nfor Nb3Sn, s 640 for V3Ga, and s 785 for Nb-N. They estimate a to be of the\norder of 10-3-10-4. We will therefore be interested in the liInit -+ oc, cr\n-\n0, with\n2cr or0 fixed. Our results hold under more general conditions, but the scaling we\nconsider is the canonical one. We note that a 0 implies that the timescale for the\nrelaxation of the magnetic field is much shorter than the timescale for vortex motion,\nso that the magnetic field is effectively quasistatic.\nTo give an indication of what to expect from more complicated vortex lines, we\nperform a brief asymptotic analysis of (7)-(10) as\nAway from the origin we find that the leading-order outer solution, denoted by\nthe subscript o, satisfies\n(13) f 1 Ao,\n(14) dr -r (rAo) Ao A3o,\n(15) Ao bounded as r\n-\n0,\n(16) Ao 0 as r\n--\noc.\nHence Ao O, fo 1. Thus we find that away from the vortex core f is unity to\nleading order and A and H are of order 1\/. This is in agreement with (12).\nNear the origin we rescale lengths by setting r R\/ec to obtain the leading-order\ninner behaviour, denoted by the subscript i, as\n1 d\nR Ai- f=f3_f(17)\n(18)\n(19) fi, Ai bounded as r\n-\n0,\n(20)\nHence Ai O,\nd(21) R dR\n-\n(22) fi, bounded as r\n-\n0,\n(23)\nMOTION OF VORTICES IN TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS 1279\nNot surprisingly, we will find that the leading-order behaviour near the vortex core of\nmore general vortex lines will also be given by (21)-(23). The existence of a unique\nsolution to (21)-(23) has been proved recently by Chen, Elliott, and Tang [6].\nThe fact that A and H are of order 1\/t away from the vortex core motivates the\nfollowing rescaling of the equations:\nA H (I)(24) A=--, H=--, (I)=--.\nDropping the primes, we now have\n) (V- iA)2. 0,\n(o. )(26) -VA(VAA) =Ooe2 +V\nwhere e 1\/.

JONATHAN CHAPMAN AND G. RICHARDSON\n3. Asymptotic analysis of a system of well-separated vortices. We con-\nsider the behaviour of a system of curvilinear vortices as\n--\n0. We assume the\nvortices to be separated by distances of order one in the present nondimensionaliza-\ntion. This means that the distance between vortices is comparable of the lengthscale\nassociated with the decay of magnetic field away for an isolated vortex (i.e., of the\norder of the penetration depth).\nFar field. We denote the outer solution away from the vortex cores by the sub-\nscript o. Equation (30) implies that fo 1 + O(2). Equations (31)-(32) give the\nleading-order behaviour of Q, H, and O as\n() v (v q(o)) + q(o) 0,\n() O(o) -v. q(o),\n(37) V A (V A H(o)) + H(o) -V2H(o) + H(o) 0.\nWe note that (35) implies that\n(38) V A H(o) -Q(o),\nwhich will prove useful later. To solve (37) we need to know the behaviour of H as\na vortex is approached, which we will obtain by matching this outer solution with an\ninner solution near each vortex core.\nInner region. We consider an inner region in the vicinity of one of the vortex\ncores. Let the vortex lie along the curve F, given by x (x, y, z) q(s, t). We define\na local coordinate system (s, p, 0, T) by\n(39) x q (s, t) + pcos0 fi (s, t) + psin 01 (s, t),\n(40) t: T,\nwhere s is arclength, h (s,t) the unit normal, and I (s,t) the unit binormal to the\ncurve F. We define the inner coordinates by introducing the stretched variable R,\ndefined by p R. The coordinate system so defined is not orthogonal away from the\nline q(s, t) when the torsion of the vortex is nonzero. However, it is approximately\northogonal, and the following expressions for Vg, V. B, Vg, V A B and O\/Ot in the\ninner region can be obtained:\nOg 10g 10g(41) Vg sseS + + + O()--ea -ee\n(42)\nOB\n+ +\n-hY + o(),\nBR cos 0 Bo sin O)\n(43)\no \/__ +v- 8-\nc(2o o )+-- sinO- cosO +0(1)\nMOTION OF VORTICES IN TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS 1281\nVAB= 1 OBf) I OB00 es + -eR- -0-eo\nOBR 0 (RBo) + C cosOBs + Os eo(44) + O0 OR\n+zR-es+(CsinOBs Os ea + 0(),\ncO 1 0)O 1 (v.eR)--+(v.eo)-0 +O(1),(45) at-\n-\nwhere C is the curvature and\n-\nis the torsion of the vortex line.\nIn the inner variables equations (33) and (32) become\n1 (0 OQi,R) OQi,(46) H, -(Q,o) oo + -R OR + O(2Qi),\n10Qi,(47) eHi,R R 00 t- eCsin0Qi, e Os + O(e2Q)\u2019\n(48)\n(49)\n(50)\n(51)\n+ eCcos0Q, + e.

This will give motivation for the form\nof the inner expansion. The analysis parallels that performed on the Biot-Savart\nintegral (76) by Saffman [131.

JONATHAN CHAPMAN AND G. RICHARDSON\nThe first two terms here correspond to the local self-induced motion of the vortex\nfilament. The final term is often interpreted as the Lorentz force on a vortex line\n(since the vortex carries a quantised amount of magnetic flux).\nRemark. If we had been considering a finite domain, rather than an infinite one,\nequation (135) would still be valid, provided that we interpret the meaning of 7(0)OeXt\ncorrectly. This term is the regular part of the solution of equation (64) evaluated at\na particular vortex, having subtracted the contribution from the vortex itself. In the\ninfinite case we were able to evaluate j(0) explicitly to give equation (78) In theOeXt\nfinite case there will in general be no closed-form solution.\nCalculation of the electric field. It is of interest to calculate the electric field\nassociated with a moving vortex. In particular, this will allow us to determine the\nsize of the voltage pulse generated by the vortex as a function of its velocity.\nOuter region. The electric field is given by\n(136) E oqt VID.\nIn the outer region, away from the vortex core, we expand\nEo E(o) -4-.\u2019..\nThe leading-order electric field is then given simply by\n(137) E(o0 O (curl H(o))Ot\nwhich is the London equation.\nInner region. In the inner coordinates (136) becomes\n(138) E _1 ((v.

This is the cause of the voltage pulse associated\nwith moving vortices.

Asymptotic analysis of a system of densely packed vortices. In the\nprevious section we considered vortices that were separated by distances of order one.\nThis generated an outer magnetic field that was also order one, and the leading-\norder term in the equation of vortex motion was a local self-induced motion due to\ncurvature.\n1292 S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN AND G. RICHARDSON\nHere we consider briefly the case in which the vortex spacing is 0(5), where\ne << 52 << 1. This leads to an outer magnetic field which is of order 1\/52. When\nwe also choose 52 <( 1\/I log e we expect that the motion due to this outer field will\nreplace the self-induced motion as the leading term in the law of vortex motion. We\nshow that this is indeed the case. There will be three regions to consider, namely,\nO(1), 0(5), and O(e)lengthscales.\nOuter region. A complete determination of the outer expansions of Ho and Qo\nwill involve averaging over many vortices. Such a procedure is performed in [5], under\nthe assumption that neighbouring vortices point in the same direction and move with\nthe same velocity, and results in the equations\n(142) Ho 10H(o)+...,\n(143) Qo Q(o) +\"\"\n(144) wt + curl(w A v()) 0,\n(145) (curl)2H(o) + H(o) w,\n(146) Q(o) -curl H(o),\nwhere a; is the vortex density, v() is the vortex velocity, and time has been rescaled\nwith the inverse of the magnitude of this velocity, which we will find to be 5. To\nclose the model we need to determine v(), which will again be provided by our inner\nanalysis of the vortex cores.\nIntermediate region. When lengths are rescaled with 5 we find that the\nleading-order equations for H and Q in the intermediate region, denoted by the\nsubscript int, become\n(147)\n(148)\n(149)\n(150)\nwith the condition\n(151)\ncurl Hint 0,\ncurl Qint 0,\ndiv Hint 0,\ndiv Qint 0\nQint eo5r\nas each vortex line is approached, where r 5-1R and R and 0 are the curvilinear\ncoordinates (39)-(40) previously introduced.

JONATHAN CHAPMAN AND G. RICHARDSON\nHence\n(169) v(0) 2Nk3 \"intf(0) \/ ; 2Nkj(0)o A ,\nwhere J(o) -(o) curl H(o) is the leading-order electric current in the outer\nregion. Thus we see that the motion of the vortex is dominated by the mean-field\nbehaviour. Equation (4) closes the model (144)-(145) in the outer region.\nRemark. We have considered the cases 5 1 and 52 << 1\/[ log [. Vortex velocities\nare dominated by the self-induced motion in the first case and by a mean-field motion\nin the second. Clearly we could also consider the case 52 1\/I log 1, in which case\nthe self-induced motion and the mean-field motion are of the same order. We would\nfind that the law of motion, as expected, is simply the sum of self-induced and mean-\nfield motions. However, in formulating the outer, mean-field model of vortex motion\n(144)-(145) we needed to assume that neighbouring vortices point in roughly the same\ndirection and move with the same speed. This will clearly not be the case while the\nvortex velocity depends on its curvature. Thus, although the case 52 1\/] log ] is\na canonical scaling which bridges the gap between our examples, the outer model is\nhard to formulate for this scaling of the parameters.\n5. Conclusion. We have performed a formal asymptotic expansion of the solu-\ntion of the Ginzburg-Landau equations for a system of curvilinear vortices in a type II\nsuperconductor as the core size of the vortices tends to zero. In this limit the vortices\nbehave as line singularities in the equation for the magnetic field.\nThis simplified model is then closed by considering a local analysis of each vortex\ncore which results in a law of motion for the singularities. The leading term in this\nlaw of motion is a local self-induced term proportional to the curvature of the vortex\nline and in the direction of the principal normal.\nIn the corresponding law of motion for vortices in an inviscid fluid the leading-\norder term is also a local self-induced motion proportional to the curvature but is\ndirected in this case along the binormal. This difference of behaviour may be illus-\ntrated by the following simple example.\nConsider the following helical line singularity:\n( 7o) q(s, t) (a(t) cos k(t)s, a(t) sin k(t)s, c(t)s + d(t))\nThen\n0q\n0-7 (h cos ks a sin ks, & sin ks + a cos ks, ds + l)\nv\/c2 + a2k2 (-ak\nsin ks, ak cos ks, c)\n(173) fi (- cos ks, sin ks, 0),\n(174) 1 1V\/c2 + a2k2 (csinks,-ccosks, ak)\n(175) C\nc2\n-f- a2\nMOTION OF VORTICES IN TYPE II SUPERCONDUCTORS 1295\nwhere a dot represents d\/dt. For a fluid vortex we have v Cb, giving\n(176) a constant,\n(177) c constant,\n(178) k -ck2(c + a2k2)3\/.\u2019\nak3(179) (c2 + a2k)3\/\"\nHence the amplitude and pitch of the helix remain constant, but the vortex precesses\nand translates. For the particular case of a circle (c 0) we have k constant,\nd t\/a, and the vortex translates uniformly. We note that a helix is the only known\nexact solution of the equations of motion of an isolated fluid vortex [2].\nFor a superconducting vortex, we have v Cn, giving\n(180) d constant,\n181) c constant,\n(182) k constant,\n-ak(183) d\nc2 + a2k2\"\nTherefore\nc2 a2(184) k log a + 2 -t + constant.\nHence the vortex does not precess or translate, the pitch of the helix remains constant,\nand its amplitude tends to zero in infinite time. For the particular case of a circle we\nhave a V\/2(t0 t), and the vortex extinguishes itself in finite time.\nAt the next order the law of motion of a superconducting vortex contains three\nterms. The first is again a local self-induced term, proportional to curvature and\nalong the principal normal. The second is a nonlocal self-induced term which is due\nto the current generated by the \"arms\" of the vortex line. The third is a term due to\nthe current generated by all the other vortices present.\nUnlike fluid vortices, for which the corresponding terms give the vortex a velocity\nequal to the underlying fluid velocity, vortices in a superconductor do not move with\nthe current but in a direction perpendicular to both it and the vortex line. This change\nin the direction of motion again leads to behaviour in a system of superconducting\nvortices very different from that in the corresponding system of fluid vortices. For\nexample, a pair of parallel rectilinear vortices in a superconductor will move along\nthe line of centres (like vortices repel, opposite attract), whereas the corresponding\nmotion of fluid vortices would be perpendicular to the line of centres.\nFinally, we considered a situation in which the density of vortices was such that\nthe self-induced term in the law of motion was replaced by the motion due to the\nmean-field as the leading term. Such a situation is important when we formulate\na mean-field model of superconducting vortices, in which the individual vortices are\nreplaced by a vortex density, as in [5].\n1296 S.
