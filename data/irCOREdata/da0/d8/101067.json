INTRODUCTION\nStructural relaxation of glassy polymers has been widely\nstudied in bulk materials, and it is now well understood\n[1\u20135]. Relaxation is important for explaining the long-term\nchanges in physical properties (e.g., elastic modulus, dielec-\ntric strength, and refractive index) during the aging of a glass\n[1,2]. In bulk polymer glasses, temperature-volume relation-\nships have been thoroughly studied and are well docu-\nmented. When a polymer melt is cooled rapidly through its\nglass transition temperature Tg to a temperature T0 a volume\nof V0 is obtained. If the glass is annealed at a temperature of\nTa, the volume will slowly relax and will approach an equi-\nlibrium volume V\u2018 over time. V\u2018 corresponds to the volume\nthat the supercooled liquid (or glass if it passes through the\nglass transition) would obtain if it were cooled extremely\nslowly [3]. Figure 1 schematically shows these relationships\nbetween volume and temperature.\nThe relaxation process can be monitored by measuring\nafter a given time of annealing t the volume of the glass Vt.\nThe relative departure from the equilibrium volume, d, can\nthen be defined [3,5] as\ndstd = sVt \u2212 V\u2018d\/V\u2018. s1d\nWhen a bulk polymer is quenched from the melt, d is typi-\ncally on the order of 0.01. At macroscopic length scales (sev-\neral millimeters or more), such small fractional volume\nchanges can be easily measured as a function of temperature\nand time through standard techniques of dilatometry. Typi-\ncally, d approaches 0 over tens of hours.\nA conventional way of analyzing relaxation kinetics is to\nplot d as a function of the logarithm of relaxation time t. The\nvolume relaxation rate b of a glass is then defined [3,5] from\nthe slope of such a plot:\nb =\ndd\nd log10 t\n. s2d\nValues of b can be used to compare two different polymers\nor to examine the effects of temperature or thermal history. A\nlimitation of this type of analysis, however, is that it cannot\ndistinguish a distribution of relaxation times from a time-\ndependent d [3]. From measurements of volume in bulk\nsamples of quenched glasses, b has been determined for sev-\nFIG. 1. Schematic illustration of the volume relaxation of a\nglass at an annealing temperature of Ta [3]. Over a sufficiently long\ntime, its volume will decrease from Va to V\u2018, which is the volume\nof the supercooled liquid at Ta.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 051805 (2004)\n1539-3755\/2004\/70(5)\/051805(8)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society70 051805-1\neral homopolymers [3], including poly(methyl methacrylate)\n(PMMA) [6], in which b<4310\u22124 when annealed at Ta\n=333 K after quenching from the melt at 393 K.\nPolymer glasses in the form of thin films have numerous\ntechnological applications and also constitute ideal systems\nfor fundamental studies of confinement effects in metastable\nsoft matter. The relaxation of volume (or thickness) in thin\nfilms of polymer glasses has been observed by several work-\ners [7\u201312] in neat polymers [7,8] and in polymers containing\nresidual solvent [9\u201313]. In these previous experiments, mea-\nsurements of thickness have been made as a function of in-\ncreasing temperature, and it was observed that the change in\nthickness (volume) due to relaxation occurs simultaneously\nwith a change resulting from thermal expansivity. Studies of\nisothermal relaxation in polymer thin films are much more\nrare [9,10,12]. The possible effects of molecular confinement\nand attraction to interfaces on the dynamics of relaxation in\npolymer thin films are largely unexplored.\nThin films are usually deposited by spin casting from a\ndilute solution in a volatile solvent. During this deposition\nprocess, solvent evaporates, and the Tg of the solution in-\ncreases until it reaches the ambient temperature, at which\npoint the solution vitrifies [14,15]. In a direct analogy to\nvitrification by reducing the temperature of a polymer melt\n(i.e., via a thermal quench), the vitrification of a polymer\nsolution occurs by reducing the concentration of the solvent\n(i.e., via a \u201csolvent quench\u201d). The solvent volume fraction\nfsol when the Tg of the solution is at the temperature of the\nsolution during casting, designated herein as fg, can be es-\ntimated via an equation derived from free volume arguments\n[16]. For a PMMA solution in toluene at room temperature\ns295 Kd, fg is estimated to be 0.19, taking the Tg of toluene\nto be 117 K [17].\nIt has been argued that when fsol,fg, the rate of solvent\nloss should be considerably slowed down, because to lose\nfurther solvent would require either the compression of the\nglassy matrix or the introduction of voids, both of which\nhave an energetic cost [14]. Specifically, the energy required\nto compress the glass, E, is proportional to the compressive\nmodulus of the glass, K, as E,Ksfg\u2212fsold2 [14]. Several\nauthors [11,14,15] have commented that polymer glasses ob-\ntained via a solvent quench will undergo a substantial vol-\nume change. At the point of vitrification, d,fg. Hence, after\na solvent quench of a polymer solution, d can be much\nhigher than after a thermal quench, in which d is typically\n0.01. If a polymer glass is constrained in one or more dimen-\nsions, significant mechanical stress could be generated\n[10,11,14,15].\nStudying the relaxation behaviour in unannealed, spin-\ncast films is potentially very useful because it may help to\nexplain a number of phenomena such as dewetting [10] and\nstress relaxation [18]. In our previous experiments [9,10],\nsolvent-cast, glassy polymer thin films have been found to\nundergo slow relaxation with a reduction in thickness and a\ncorresponding release of solvent. The rate of relaxation is\nexpected to be influenced by the polymer segmental mobility\n[3]. Hence, measurements of relaxation in spin-cast thin\nfilms provide a means of probing molecular mobility in con-\nfined systems.\nOne aim of the present work is to measure b and d for\nspin-cast glassy polymer thin films. As these two parameters\nare characteristic of molecular mobility, their measurement\ncan then be used as a probe at the molecular level in confined\nsystems. Because data are available for the relaxation of bulk\nPMMA, it makes an ideal model system. The structural re-\nlaxation in thin films is conveniently measured in situ using\nspectroscopic ellipsometry at several wavelengths [9]. The\nexperiments that are described here explore the possible ef-\nfects of film thickness, interactions with the substrate, and\nmolecular entanglement on the measured parameters b\nand d.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nPMMA (Polymer Laboratories, Church Stretton, U.K.) of\nseveral different molecular weights Mw was used: 8.0\n3104 g mol\u22121 (polydispersity index of Mw\/Mn=1.02); 1.42\n3105 g mol\u22121 sMw\/Mn=1.02d; 7.723105 g mol\u22121 sMw\/Mn\n=1.02d; 1.253106 g mol\u22121 sMw\/Mn=1.07d. According to\nthe suppliers, the PMMA was 80% syndiotactic, 16.5% iso-\ntactic, and 3.5% atactic. The Tg for the Mw=1.42\n3105 g mol\u22121 polymer was determined by differential scan-\nning calorimetry to be 382 K. Polymer films were spin cast\nfrom dilute solutions in AnalaR grade toluene onto (100)\nsilicon wafers. In an effort to study film relaxation at the\nearliest stages of spin casting, the spin time was set to only\n3 s. The films were spin cast at spinning rates between 1900\nand 4000 revolutions per minute (rpm), with 2000 rpm being\nused for most experiments. The film thicknesses were varied\nby adjusting the polymer volume fraction fpol in the polymer\nsolution between 0.003 and 0.065.\nIn most experiments, the polished silicon substrates were\nused as received; the native oxide was intact, and the sub-\nstrate is referred to here as SiO2\/Si. In some experiments,\nthe surface of the silicon was modified by grafting octyl\ntrichlorosilane onto the native oxide of silicon using standard\ntechniques described elsewhere [19]. This substrate is re-\nferred to as C8. In other experiments, a thin film of gold\n(200 nm thick) was thermally evaporated onto glass slides\nprior to the PMMA film deposition.\nFilm thickness as a function of time was determined using\na rotating analyzer spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam\nCo., Inc., Lincoln, NE). To control the temperature, sub-\nstrates were mounted on a heating stage (Linkam, Tadworth,\nU.K.) placed in the ellipsometer beam. To measure the fast\nchanges in film thickness immediately after spin casting, el-\nlipsometry parameters (c and D) were acquired at four dif-\nferent wavelengths as a function of time at intervals of about\n20 s. (The use of four wavelengths enables more reliable\nthickness and index measurements in comparison to data col-\nlection at a single wavelength.) When the rate of change of\nfilm thickness was slower, spectroscopic scans over the\nwavelength range from 400 to 800 nm were obtained at\nregular time intervals, allowing both h and refractive index\nto be obtained with confidence [9]. In modeling the data, the\nrefractive index dispersion was described by a Cauchy equa-\ntion [20]. The film thickness h was obtained from the best fit\nto a model using a Marquardt algorithm [21]. In a one-\ndimensional analogy to V\u2018, an equilibrium thickness h\u2018 was\ndefined as the film thickness that was obtained after heating\nRICHARDSON et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 051805 (2004)\n051805-2\nthe film on the hot stage to a temperature of 423 K (well\nabove Tg) for 10 min and cooling slowly to 298 K at a rate\nof 2 K min\u22121. For a thin film, d is then defined in this work\nas\nd = sht \u2212 h\u2018d\/h\u2018. s3d\nIn these measurements, the light beam probed the same\narea of a film when measuring ht and h\u2018. This methodology\nensured that errors were not introduced by any lateral non-\nuniformity of film thickness. In some preliminary experi-\nments, some films were heated a second time to 423 K for\n10 min and then cooled again. It was found that the same or\nhighly similar values of h\u2018 (within 0.1% in all cases) were\nobtained. That is, all of the measured thickness decrease oc-\ncurred within 10 min of reaching the annealing temperature\ns423 Kd; a longer heat treatment did not cause further relax-\nation. The result was found to be the same for films ranging\nin thickness from 39 to 640 nm. This finding gave us con-\nfidence in referring to the thickness after annealing as h\u2018.\nSome experiments to determine b were carried out at\nroom temperature, but because the relaxation was so slow, it\ntook four or more days before ht approached h\u2018. Most mea-\nsurements were therefore performed at 328 K. In these ex-\nperiments, the film was placed on the heating stage immedi-\nately after spin casting and heated to 328 K at a rate of\n50 K min\u22121. Data collection was commenced as soon as the\nexperimental temperature was reached. The film was then\nmaintained at the temperature over a period of about 20 h,\nuntil the film thickness approached its equilibrium value. Af-\nter each relaxation experiment was complete, the film was\nannealed in situ at 423 K for 10 min and then cooled slowly\nto 328 K at a rate of 2 K min\u22121. A further spectroscopic scan\nwas carried out to determine h\u2018 at 328 K.\nA special procedure was carried out to obtain an accurate\nvalue for the initial thickness, i.e., immediately after spin\ncasting. Dynamic scans were made for 10 min and then fol-\nlowed by a single spectroscopic scan. The Cauchy constants\ndetermined from the best fit of the data from the spectro-\nscopic scan were then used to fit the dynamic data. Prelimi-\nnary experiments justified the modeling of the dynamic data\nby fixing the value of the Cauchy constants. The refractive\nindices of toluene and PMMA are very similar. As solvent is\nlost from the film and the glassy matrix decreases in thick-\nness, independent measurements found that the change in\nrefractive index was negligible because of the index match-\ning. To allow for the variable time lag between initiating the\nellipsometry scan and collecting the first data point, the\nthickness obtained at 2 min after starting the ellipsometer\nwas arbitrarily taken to be the initial thickness h0. Using this\nvalue of h0, the initial departure from equilibrium, d0, could\nbe calculated.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Relaxation in glassy thin films\nAn example of a typical dynamic ellipsometry scan is\npresented in Fig. 2. The ellipsometry parameters c and D\nobtained from a PMMA film spin cast from toluene are plot-\nted for the first 10 min after casting (unless stated otherwise,\nMw=1.423105 g mol\u22121). The standard deviations on c and\nD are typically 0.05 and 0.5\u00b0, respectively, and so the\nchanges in the parameters are easily resolved in this mea-\nsurement. Greater confidence in the thickness values is\nachieved by acquiring measurements at four different wave-\nlengths of light rather than just one. The corresponding best-\nfit film thickness, which is also shown in the same figure,\ndecreases by 4 nm to a thickness of 228 nm. This decrease in\nthickness is much greater than the precision of the measure-\nment (about 0.2 nm).\nThe thicknesses of spin-cast PMMA films were found to\ncontinue decreasing over several days. The spectroscopic\ndata in Fig. 3, obtained from the same film on three different\noccasions, reveal how this thickness decrease can be readily\nFIG. 2.

An analysis of these and intermediate spectra, us-\ning the Cauchy model for the PMMA refractive index, is\npresented in Fig. 4. It is seen that this particular film was\n165.5 nm thick after casting and decreased in thickness to\n154.0 nm after four days at room temperature (295 K). De-\nspite this significant decrease in thickness, the film decreased\neven further to h\u2018=153.2 nm after heating at 423 K for\n10 min and then cooling to room temperature. Using this\nvalue of h\u2018, the measurements of h were converted to d. The\nresulting values are presented in the inset of Fig. 4 as a\nfunction of the logarithm of the aging time, which is the\nconventional way of presenting relaxation data [3]. It is seen\nthat d decreases from an initial value of d0<0.10. At a\nhigher temperature of 328 K, a film with a similar thickness\nrelaxes by the same amount but at a faster rate in comparison\nto the room temperature measurement, as also shown in the\ninset of Fig. 4. This result is consistent with experiments on\nbulk systems [3] in which the maximum value of b is ob-\ntained when the annealing temperature is approximately Tg\n\u221250 K. An annealing temperature of 328 K for a PMMA\nfilm is equivalent to Tg\u221254 K.\nIt was not known with certainty whether the large value\nobserved for d was a general characteristic of PMMA in the\nform of a thin film or if it is characteristic of the solvent\nquench during spin casting. A comparison was therefore\nmade between the results for the film shown in Fig. 4 and a\nfilm of similar thickness that was quenched from the melt. To\nprepare a thermally quenched sample, a spin-cast PMMA\nfilm was equilibrated on the hot stage at 423 K (well above\nits Tg) and then quenched by immersion in liquid nitrogen.\nThe comparison of the data is shown in Fig. 5. The thermally\nquenched film was found to decrease in thickness slowly\nover time, but the value of d was much lower in comparison\nto the solvent-quenched film, with d0<0.002.\nFrom the data in Fig. 5, the relaxation rate b at 328 K for\nthe freshly cast film was calculated to be 2.5310\u22122, whereas\nfor the thermally quenched film b=7.0310\u22124. Solvent\nquenching results in a relaxation rate that is at least two\norders of magnitude greater than what is obtained with ther-\nmal quenching. The b value for the thermally quenched thin\nfilm is comparable to what has been found elsewhere [6] for\nbulk samples of thermally quenched PMMA at a similar tem-\nperature s333 Kd, where b=4310\u22124. Thus it is seen that b\nfor glassy PMMA in a thin film is on the same order of\nmagnitude as in the bulk.\nThe data in Fig. 5 clearly illustrate that b for a solvent-\nquenched polymer film is significant, but little is known\nabout what affects b in such systems. Further experiments\nwere therefore conducted to explore the extent to which b in\na solvent-quenched film is influenced by the film thickness.\nFigure 6 compares relaxation data obtained at 328 K from\nspin-cast PMMA films with three different equilibrium thick-\nnesses: h\u2018=35, 69, and 138 min. b was calculated from the\ninitial linear regions of the data, as shown in the figure by the\nstraight lines. The results reveal that b increases with in-\ncreasing film thickness; b is twice as great in the 138 nm\nfilm in comparison to the 35 nm film. But even in the case of\nthe 35 nm solvent-quenched film, b is one order of magni-\ntude higher than in the thermally quenched film.\nAn obvious explanation for this trend is that the thicker\nfilms are observed to have a higher d0. Further experiments\non spin-cast films over a wider range of thicknesses going\nfrom 30 to 300 nm were conducted, and this trend was sup-\nported. As d0 increases, b likewise increases, as shown in\nFIG. 3. Ellipsometry spectra showing c (unfilled symbols) and\nD (filled symbols) for a PMMA film on Si at RT: 1 h after spin\ncasting (circles); 4 days after spin casting (squares); and after an-\nnealing at 423 K for 10 min and cooling at 2 K min\u22121 to RT (tri-\nangles).

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 051805 (2004)\n051805-4\nFig. 7. This behavior was predicted by Kovacs [5] who pre-\nsented a relationship in which d0 is proportional, to a first\napproximation, to b through a constant. This relationship\nwas verified experimentally in bulk samples of poly(vinyl\nacetate) [5]. Physically, this correlation means that a glass\nthat is further away from its equilibrium volume will relax\nfaster. Hence, in order to understand the observed thickness\ndependence of b, it is necessary to explain why d0 increases\nwith increasing thickness.\nB. Thickness dependence of d0\nThe dependence of d0, and hence the structure of the\npolymer glass, on film thickness is an intriguing result. Fur-\nther experiments were conducted to understand this phenom-\nenon. One possible explanation could be that the polar meth-\nacrylate groups of PMMA are attracted to the native oxide\nsurface of silicon. As a result of this attraction, a denser layer\nmight then be formed along the substrate during the film\ndeposition. Thinner films would have a greater average den-\nsity, and they would therefore show a smaller fractional de-\ncrease in thickness. This hypothesis was tested through the\nuse of two other substrates (Au\/Si and C8\/Si) that are less\nattractive to PMMA.\nFigure 8 compares measurements of d0 at room tempera-\nture for spin-cast film on three different types of substrate: Si\nwith a native oxide sSiO2\/Sid, C8\/Si, and Au\/Si. Regardless\nof the substrate, d0 increases with h\u2018 in an identical way. The\namount of structural relaxation during and after spin casting,\nas gauged by d0, is not affected by interactions between the\npolymer and the substrate.\nIn previous work, Fernandez et al. [13] measured the\nthicknesses of PMMA films (spin cast from cyclohexanone\nor para-xylene) before and after annealing at 393 K. They\nlikewise observed a thickness decrease upon annealing. Al-\nthough the number of films studied was limited to seven,\nthere is some evidence for a thickness dependence of d0. For\na film with h\u2018=156.8 nm, their results are consistent with\nd0=0.123, whereas when h\u2018=40.0 nm, d0=0.048. These\nfinding are broadly in line with the present results.\nThe thicknesses of the films in Fig. 8 were adjusted by\nvarying the concentration of the solution used for spin cast-\ning. It has been found recently that when glassy polymers are\nprecipitated from dilute solutions, below the polymer overlap\nvolume fraction f*, their Tg is reduced below the bulk value\n[22,23]. This result was attributed to a lower extent of en-\ntanglement in the polymers obtained from dilute solution.\nThe concept that reduced entanglement density is responsible\nfor a reduction in Tg is not supported by the work of other\nauthors [24,25], however. Nevertheless, it has been pointed\nout that since the polymer molecules fill all available space,\nwhen they are not entangled their conformation will be com-\npacted from a random coil to a smaller, tighter coil [22].\nHence, less entangled PMMA molecules should be more\ncompact and perhaps better able to pack into a dense film\nduring the deposition process. A simple scaling argument\n[26] predicts that f* varies with the degree of polymeriza-\ntion N as given by f* =na\u22123N\u22124\/5. Here, n is the volume of\nthe repeat unit (n=0.147 nm3 for PMMA), and a is the ef-\nfective length per repeat unit (reported as 0.65 nm for\nPMMA [27]). Thus, for Mw=1.423105 g mol\u22121, the predic-\ntion is f* =1.61310\u22123. Experimentally, it was found that to\nspin-cast a film thicker than 10 nm, however, fpol must be\ngreater than 3310\u22123. Hence, in our experiments, fpol.f*,\nand there is always some molecular overlap in the solutions\nused for spin-casting PMMA with this N. Thicker films will\nrequire solutions that are well within the overlap region.\nThe thickness of a spin-cast film, h, is predicted [28] to\nvary as s1+k \/hd\u22120.5, where k is a constant that depends on\nFIG. 6.

In dilute\nsolutions of a polymer in a solvent with a viscosity of hsolv,\nh will increase with the volume fraction Vf occupied by iso-\nlated polymer coils as h=hsolvs1+2.5Vfd. In turn, Vf is a\nfunction of the number density of molecules s,N\u22121d and\ntheir volume, which scales with the radius of gyration, and\nhence scales with N as sN3\/5d3 [26]. Thus, in the dilute limit,\nwhen entanglement effects can be neglected, h has this de-\npendence on fpol and N:\nh , s1 + k\/fpolN4\/5d1\/2, s4d\nindicating that\u2014as is commonly observed in the\nlaboratory\u2014a film of a given thickness h can be cast from a\nmore dilute solution of a high-N polymer or from a more\nconcentrated solution of a low-N polymer. To explore the\npossible effect of molecular overlap and entanglements, d0\nwas determined for spin-cast films of PMMA with four dif-\nferent N. In these experiments, films of approximately the\nsame thickness were deposited from solutions of different\nconcentration. The experiments are thus designed to separate\nout the effects of entanglement from true thickness effects.\nData obtained from PMMA of four different molecular\nweights are shown in Fig. 9. There is a clear trend in which\nd0 increases with increasing fpol for all four N. Although\nthere is some scatter in the data, a second general trend is\nobserved. For a particular range of fpol, a higher N tends to\nyield a higher d0. In turn, higher N values for a particular\nfpol result in thicker films, indicating that a thickness depen-\ndence is observed in the data. To demonstrate this depen-\ndence, the data from Fig. 8 and 9 are replotted in Fig. 10. All\nof the d0 values are seen to follow an identical dependence\non film thickness, regardless of the combination of fpol and\nN.\nAlthough d0 is seen to vary with both fpol and h\u2018, the\ndependence on h\u2018 is the dominant factor. The data in Table I\nillustrate this point for PMMA films cast from low N sMw\n=8.03104 g mol\u22121d and high N sMw=1.253106 g mol\u22121d\nsolutions. It is seen that d0 is insensitive to changes in fpol\nwhen h\u2018 is fixed. For instance, films A and B have quite\ndifferent fpol (0.050 and 0.029) but comparable h\u2018 (262 and\n276 nm). The d0 values are identical for A and B (0.134),\nindicating that they are not influenced by the difference in\nfpol. A similar observation can be made when comparing\nfilm C (111 nm thick) and film D (102 nm thick), which\nhave very different fpol but comparable values of d0 (0.097\nand 0.101). On the other hand, d0 is sensitive to changes in\nh\u2018 when fpol is fixed. Films B and C have nearly the same\nfpol (0.029 and 0.027) yet very different d0 (0.134 and\n0.097) and dissimilar h\u2018. Likewise, films D and E have\nnearly the same fpol (0.017 and 0.018) yet very different d0\n(0.101 and 0.062). It is apparent that d0 increases when h\u2018\nincreases, even when fpol stays roughly constant.\nNevertheless, entanglement effects cannot be ruled out by\nthe data. To deposit thin films of sufficient thickness, fpol is\nrequired to be greater than f* in all cases (such as illustrated\nby values listed in Table I). For a given fpol, however, solu-\ntions with a higher N are farther from f* compared to solu-\ntions with a lower N. Hence, the lower d0 values that are\nobserved for film C in comparison to B, and also in E in\ncomparison to D, could be related to the fact that the solu-\ntions for E and C are closer to f*, and hence the molecules\nare less overlapped in comparison to the more concentrated\nsolutions.\nFurther experiments were conducted to determine the rea-\nsons for the variation in d0.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 051805 (2004)\n051805-6\nness of a thin film can also be varied through the rotational\nvelocity of spin casting. Whereas the data presented in Figs.\n8 and 9 were obtained from films deposited at 2000 rpm,\nsome of the films in Fig. 10 were deposited at 1900, 3000, or\n4000 rpm. Consequently, any dependence on thickness can\nbe attributed neither to differences in fpol nor to entangle-\nment effects. The decrease in h when increasing the speed\nfrom 2000 to 4000 rpm is relatively small, but nevertheless\nthere is an observable corresponding decrease in d0 that is\nconsistent with the previous findings obtained at varying\nfpol. This result provides further evidence for a true thick-\nness effect on the value of d0.\nFurther insight can be obtained from Fig. 10 through the\nexamination of d0 in the limits of h\u21920 and h\u2192\u2018 (bulk). In\nthe limit of very thin films, d0 approaches zero. Physically,\nthis result makes sense, because it means that films that must\nconsist of a single, flattened layer of molecules will be un-\nable to decrease in thickness after annealing. In an ultrathin\nfilm, molecules cannot relax to a flatter conformation. In the\nlimit of thick films, d0 is seen to approach a plateau value of\n0.16. At the point of vitrification, fg<0.19. The loss of this\nvolume fraction of solvent, without the introduction of voids,\nwould yield a fractional volume change of 0.19, which is just\nslightly higher than what is found for d0 in the limit of\nthicker films. We suggest that the initial conformational state\nof the films in the thick-film limit corresponds to that at fg,\nwhere the film vitrifies. In a thick film, interfaces will have a\ndiminished influence, and so the state of the film is identical\nto that at the point of vitrification. This result suggests that\nthick films display bulk behavior as a result of a diminished\ninfluence of interfaces.\nOur results are consistent with measurements of density\nprofiles in PMMA thin films, using neutron and x-ray reflec-\ntivity and reported elsewhere [29,30]. The density near the\ninterface with the substrate was greater than near the inter-\nface with air. A denser structure would be expected to un-\ndergo a lesser amount of relaxation. A larger proportion of\nthe molecules in a thinner film are near the substrate, which\ncould provide an explanation for their lower d0 values. Our\nresults indicate, however, that any interface effect is insensi-\ntive to the composition of the substrate.\nDuring spin casting, a dilute solution is transformed very\nquickly to a glass. Molecules that are expanded from a ran-\ndom coil conformation in a good solvent are presumed to\nentangle with others and collapse to a random coil. This\ntransformation requires molecular mobility, and it will cease\nwhen mobility is lost at the point of vitrification. A liquidlike\nlayer with enhanced molecular mobility near a film surface,\nas has been proven conclusively to exist in neat, glassy ho-\nmopolymer films [31,32], could conceivably result in an en-\nhanced rate of this transformation. The lower d0 obtained in\nthin films could indicate that this transformation goes further\nto completion prior to vitrification. Alternatively, in thin\nfilms there might be some very fast relaxation after vitrifica-\ntion, which takes place prior to the measurement of d0. The\nthinner films are therefore closer to their equilibrium thick-\nness at the time of the measurement. In any case, these re-\nsults provide clear evidence for greater stability of film thick-\nness in thinner spin-cast films.\nRecent experiments by Grohens et al. [33] have found\nthat the Tg of equilibrated syndiotactic PMMA thin films\ndecreases as the thickness decreases. A decreased Tg in thin-\nner films in our experiments would lead to a decreased value\nof fg, which would then presumably result in a decreased d0.\nAs an example, if the Tg of PMMA in the thinnest film is\ndepressed by 30 K from the bulk value (as found by Grohens\net al.), then it is predicted that fg decreases from 0.19 to\n0.13. Thus, the observed decrease in d0 of 0.135 (from 0.161\nto 0.026) is even greater than what is predicted from the\nprevious data on Tgshd. Our observations cannot be ex-\nplained by the effects of Tgshd alone, although they might\nplay a part.\nGrohens et al. also reported that the Tg of the PMMA thin\nfilms was a strong function of the tacticity and the type of\nsolvent used in film deposition [33]. It was argued that mo-\nlecular conformations in the solution persisted in the solid\nfilms. In the present work, these factors were not explored.\nToluene and syndiotactic PMMA were used in all experi-\nments. We point out, however, that the Tg of solvents can\nspan a wide range of values, and hence the value of fg for a\ngiven polymer will vary with the solvent used in the solution.\nIf the argument that d0 in the thick-film limit approaches fg\nis correct, then one would expect that d0 would depend on\nthe solvent in a predictable way. Further work is under way\nin our laboratory to test this hypothesis.\nOur analysis of the ellipsometry data did not consider any\ngradient in the refractive index (or density) with depth into\nthe film. However, previous studies of spin-cast PMMA films\nusing neutron reflectivity have found that the density of poly-\nmer changes with depth into the surface. There are conflict-\ning findings, however, as to whether the denser layer is at the\nair surface [13] or near the substrate [29] and whether thinner\nfilms are more dense [13] or less dense [29] than thicker\nfilms. Likewise, there are some theoretical predictions [34]\nof nonuniformity in solvent concentration in spin-cast films\nthat depend on the conditions of spin casting. The presence\nof such small variations in refractive index, however, is not\nexpected to alter significantly the values of d0 that are ob-\ntained in our experiments. In our experiments, an average\nrefractive index for each film was fitted to the data.\nIV. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nIn summary, the magnitude of the structural relaxation in\nspin-cast films of PMMA, as measured through d0, has been\nfound to depend strongly on the film thickness. In very thin\nfilms sh\u2018,20 nmd, d0 was found to be less than 0.06. The\nfilm thickness is relatively stable, and it decreases only\nslightly after annealing above Tg. In thicker films\ns.500 nmd, d0 reaches a plateau value of 0.16. When a\nPMMA solution in toluene at a temperature of 295 K passes\nthrough the glass transition, fsol will be 0.19. Thus, the ob-\nserved change in thickness is close to the change expected\nfor the loss of the toluene.\nFilm thickness was adjusted through fpol, PMMA mo-\nlecular weight, and the rotational velocity during spin cast-\ning. Regardless of how the thickness was adjusted, the thick-\nness dependence of d0 was the same. In all cases, the\nsolutions used for spin casting were above the overlap con-\ncentration. Thicker films are cast from more concentrated\nTHICKNESS DEPENDENCE OF STRUCTURAL\u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 051805 (2004)\n051805-7\nsolutions, however, and one might speculate that this factor\nplays a role in determining d0. However, the experiments\nshow that d0 depends much more strongly on film thickness\nthan on fpol. One explanation for the results is that there is\nenhanced mobility near the film surface, and during the ear-\nliest stages of film deposition the molecules are able to relax\nto a greater extent.\nThe same dependence of b and d0 on film thickness, al-\nthough weaker, has likewise been observed in our laboratory\nin poly(styrene) and in poly(butyl methacrylate), and hence it\nappears to be a general phenomenon and not specific to\nPMMA. The fact that the magnitude of d0 is found to vary\nbetween polymers of different composition gives us confi-\ndence that the thickness dependence is real and cannot be\nattributed to errors in the thickness measurements. This re-\nsult has implications for applications that use glassy polymer\nthin films. The data reveal that thinner films will be more\nstable and undergo less relaxation in comparison to thicker\nfilms.
