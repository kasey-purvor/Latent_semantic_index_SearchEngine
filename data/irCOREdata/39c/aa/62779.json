The factors controlling surface O3 concentrations are discussed initially \nto provide a basis for the ensuing discussion, followed by a summary of the evidence \nfor recent trends in ground-level ozone concentrations, i.e. over the past 3 decades, \nwhich have shown a significant increase in the annual average in \u2018background\u2019 air \ntypical of the unpolluted northern hemisphere. Closer to precursor sources, although \nurban winter concentrations have increased, rural peak spring and summer \nconcentrations during ozone \u2018episodes\u2019 have decreased markedly in response to \nemissions reductions. In order to determine whether such trends are meaningful, the \nstatistical techniques for determining temporal trends are reviewed. The possible \ncauses of long-term trends in ozone are then discussed, with particular reference to the \nuse of chemistry-transport models to interpret past trends. Such models are also used \nto make predictions of future trends in surface ozone concentrations, but few are \ncomprehensive in integrating future climate changes with changes in land use and in \nemissions of ozone precursors. Guidance is given on the likely effects of \nclimate\/precursor\/chemistry interactions so that model predictions can be judged. \nKeywords\nOzone, photo-oxidants, climate change, plant health, global emissions\n1\/24\nIntroduction\nPhotochemical oxidants, and ozone (O3) in particular, are recognised as posing a \nthreat to human health and the health of vegetation across much of the industrialised \nworld (Karnosky et al., 2007), and an increasing threat in areas with rapidly \nincreasing industrialisation e.g.(Ashmore and Marshall, 1999; Emberson et al., 2001). \nConsequently, controls on emissions of the O3 precursor pollutants, nitrogen oxides \n(NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have been introduced in order to \nreduce the prevalence of high concentrations of O3, and the associated health risks. \nThis has proved more complex than the regulation of emissions of sulphur dioxide \n(SO2), because the sources are more varied; for NOx, all combustion sources must be \nconsidered \u2013 large stationary sources such as power stations, vehicles and biomass \nburning \u2013 while for VOCs, sources include industrial emissions, vehicle usage and \nbiogenic emissions. Moreover, the interplay between sources and sinks of O3 and \nclimate is complex, with non-linear behaviour, so that the overall effects of emission \ncontrols on O3 production cannot be simply predicted. Nevertheless, emission controls \nhave been implemented in Europe and elsewhere, and the effects on subsequent O3 \nproduction have been investigated e.g.(Monks, 2005).\nIn terms of vegetation health, considerable evidence has been accumulated on the \nrelationship between plant exposure to O3 and either growth\/yield reductions or \nvisible injury e.g.(Ashmore, 2005). A commonly-used threshold for calculating \neffective dose is 40 ppb (nL L-1), as the AOT40 (Fuhrer et al., 1997; Mauzerall and \nWang, 2001) or D40 (Ollinger et al., 1997), defined as the accumulated \u2018excess\u2019 O3 \nconcentration above 40 ppb during daylight hours through the growing season. Even \nat \u2018background\u2019 measurement sites, remote from sources of O3 precursors, peak \nhourly concentrations sometimes exceed 60 ppb and may exceed 100 ppb if polluted \nair masses are transported to the site (Vingarzan, 2004). Closer to sources of \nprecursors, such concentrations are the norm during the spring and summer and have \nthe potential to cause significant effects on plant growth and crop yield. The apparent \nthreshold for O3 effects reflects the capacity of plants to counteract the formation of \nreactive oxygen species (ROS) when O3 is absorbed through stomata. Measures of \nexposure (such as the AOT40) do not include the rate at which O3 enters leaves, and \nflux-based approaches to dose:effect relationships are being developed (Tuovinen et \nal., 2007). However, it is still not clear to what extent the observed damage to \nvegetation is the result of periodic exposure to high concentrations (well above any \nsupposed threshold) or to chronic exposure to concentrations near the threshold. Part \nof the uncertainty is caused by a lack of understanding of the capacity of individual \nplant species to \u2018detoxify\u2019 the ROS formed when O3 enters a leaf, and the ways in \nwhich factors such as nutrition, drought stress, genotype and phenology influence a \nplant\u2019s ability to tolerate exposure to high O3 concentrations (Tausz et al., 2007). The \ndistinction between \u2018acute\u2019 and \u2018chronic\u2019 exposure becomes important when \nconsidering the pattern of O3 exposure that has developed, at least in western Europe \nand North America, over the past decades, with a trend towards lower peak \nconcentrations during spring and summer O3 \u2018episodes\u2019, but higher average O3 \nconcentrations throughout the year (see below).\n The purpose of this paper is to summarise recent research on trends in concentration \nof O3 at the earth\u2019s surface, and the causes of such trends, and to set in context the \npredictions of models that incorporate different future scenarios of precursor \n2\/24\nemissions, the role of climate change, and the interactions between changes in climate \nand predicted O3 formation. \nFactors controlling surface O3 concentrations\nThe main pathways of O3 formation and loss in the troposphere are shown in Figure 1. \nOzone is transported downwards from the stratosphere by stratosphere-troposphere \nexchange (STE), a process that is coupled to global weather patterns and sea surface \ntemperatures, and therefore linked to long-term changes in climate (Olsen et al., \n2007). Within the troposphere, O3 is formed as a result of a cycle of photochemical \nreactions involving nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \n(Atkinson, 2000). The main reaction in the troposphere that forms O3 is the photolysis \nof NO2 to give NO and O, with the O atom reacting with O2 to form O3, which can \nthen react with NO to regenerate NO2. In the absence of other reactions, NO, NO2 and \nO3 coexist in an equilibrium (the NOx photostationary state, Figure 1) determined by \nthe rate of NO2 photolysis (sunlight intensity). Photolysis of O3 by short-wave \nultraviolet light yields a reactive O atom, which may lose energy by collision with O2 \nand N2 molecules in air and then react with O2 to re-form O3, or may react with water \nvapour (H2O) to generate hydroxyl radicals (OH). OH radicals react with VOCs (R-\nH), usually by abstracting a H atom to form H2O; the remaining organic radical R- \nadds O2 to form a peroxy radical, RO2. Peroxy radicals can then react with NO to \nform NO2 and other organic radicals or molecules; this reaction shifts the equilibrium \nbetween NO and NO2 towards NO2 leading to greater rates of net O3 formation. The \ncycle can be closed by reaction of OH with NO2 to form nitric acid (HNO3) or by self-\nreaction of peroxy radicals at low NOx concentrations (NOx  = NO + NO2). The net \nphotochemical formation of O3 can therefore be limited by the availability of either \nNOx or VOCs; over most of the continents net O3 production is NOx limited (i.e. \nreductions in NOx emissions will lead to a reduction in average O3 concentrations), \nbut peak concentrations in summer may be VOC limited (Derwent et al., 2003). Over \nthe oceans, where NOx concentrations are small (<0.05 ppb) net O3 destruction may \noccur (the Low NOx pathway in Figure 1). The net global production of tropospheric \nO3 represents a small difference between large production and destruction through \nchemical reactions in the troposphere, which is therefore sensitive to changes in \nemissions of precursors and destruction pathways, e.g. the reaction of O from O3 \nphotolysis with water vapour (H2O).\n3\/24\nFigure 1:   Schematic diagram of the major sources and sinks of ozone in the \ntroposphere, showing the key chemical reactions involved.\nThe third contributory factor to tropospheric O3 concentrations is removal at the \nearth\u2019s surface by reaction of O3 in or on the surfaces of plants and soil, a process \nknown as \u2018dry deposition\u2019. Uptake into leaves is determined by stomatal conductance, \nwhich varies with water and CO2 availability, and growth-stage of the vegetation. \nBare soil and external leaf surfaces also act as efficient sinks for O3. The overall loss \nat the earth\u2019s surface approximately balances the transfer into the troposphere from \nthe stratosphere.\nEvidence for recent trends in ground-level ozone concentrations\nA comprehensive review of surface O3 background levels and trends was published in \n2004 (Vingarzan, 2004), and while including measurements from the late 19th and mid \n20th century, the review focused on data since the 1970s at \u2018background\u2019 stations. In \nthis context, a \u2018background\u2019 station is one that is remote from sources of precursor \npollutants. A more recent review of \u2018background\u2019 sites included both surface \nmeasurements and ozonesonde data from higher in the troposphere (Oltmans et al., \n2006). However, because O3 is a secondary pollutant (i.e. not emitted directly, but \nformed from precursors through photochemical processes in the atmosphere) remote \nsites can be influenced by air masses that have been transported many hundreds or \neven thousands of km. Consequently, a \u2018background\u2019 site may not always record \n\u2018background\u2019 O3 concentrations, in the sense of O3 concentrations in air masses that \nhave not been exposed to emissions of man-made precursors. This point was made \nexplicitly in studies of long-term O3 trends from Mace Head, on the west coast of \nIreland, where detailed analysis of other constituents of the sampled air and air-mass \n4\/24\n Stratosphere\nTroposphereO3\nO(1D)\nO(3P)\nO2\nOH\nH2O\nUV\uf07e\nRH\nR + H2O\nRO2\nO2\nCO\nH + CO2\nHO2\nO2\nNO\nNO2\n+ O(3P)\nUV\uf07e\nO3\nH2O2 + O2\nfurther \nreactions\nO2\nO3\nSurface\nHNO3\nOzone photolysis\nLow NOx pathway\nVOCs \nDry deposition \nOzone \nformation\nPeroxy radical\nozone formation\nStrat-trop exchange\nHumidity dependent \nOH formation\nNOx removal\n[M]\nNOx photo-\nstationary\nstate\nback trajectory calculations were used to identify \u2018true\u2019 background air unaffected by \nregionally transported pollution (Derwent et al., 2007). Confusion in the use of the \nterm \u2018background\u2019 may lead to confusion in describing the difference between trends \nfrom sites in remote regions, and trends in unpolluted air. Vingarzan\u2019s (2004) review \nlists 22 \u2018surface\u2019 or \u2018near surface\u2019 background sites at which increasing O3 trends \nhave been reported, and 8 sites at which decreasing O3 trends have been reported. \nThere are no clear geographical patterns to these trends, and the picture is complicated \nfurther by the lack of long-term data sets. In some studies a pattern of decreasing \nconcentrations during one decade may be followed by increasing concentrations in the \nsubsequent decade, so the period over which the trend is assessed may determine the \napparent direction. The review concluded somewhat cautiously that \u2018background\u2019 O3 \nlevels in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes have increased over the past 30 \nyears, with the greatest rate of increase in the earlier part of that period, and that the \nmore recent slowdown in O3 increases is attributable in part to emission controls on \nprecursors. Attention was drawn, however, to the importance of intercontinental \ntransport of O3 and its precursors in contributing to \u2018background\u2019 concentrations of O3 \nat remote sites, particularly in the northern hemisphere. The more recent review \n(Oltmans et al., 2006) confirmed these observations for mid-latitude sites in the \nNorthern Hemisphere, including Japan \u2013 a result that is somewhat surprising given the \nrecent large increases in O3 precursor emissions in China and India (Streets and \nWaldhoff, 2000). Data from vertical profiles, however, indicate a recent increase in O3 \nconcentrations at higher altitudes in the troposphere which may be related to changes \nin transport patterns. Trends in the Arctic were small, but in the Southern Hemisphere, \nsurface and mid-troposphere concentrations at mid-latitudes have been increasing, \nespecially in spring (Oltmans et al., 2006).\nTrends from ship-borne O3 measurements in the North and South Atlantic from 1977 \nto 2002 show in more detail the latitudinal variation in O3 behaviour (Lelieveld et al., \n2004) under maritime \u2018background\u2019 conditions. For the North Atlantic between 40\u00b0 \nand 60\u00b0 N the trend was not significant, but to both north and south of these latitudes \nthe trends were significantly upward, and ranged from +0.12 to +0.68 ppb y-1. \nAnalysis of the frequency distributions of the measurements showed an overall \nupward shift in the median concentrations rather than simply a shift in the frequency \nof high concentrations, which would be the case if samples represented increases in \nthe frequency of sampling locally polluted air. Moreover, the loss of low \nconcentrations from the frequency distributions suggested an overall increase in true \nbackground concentrations. Continental emissions of anthropogenic (fossil-fuel \nderived) NOx in Africa, rather than changes in biomass burning, were suggested as the \ncause of the largest increases, which effectively doubled \u2018background\u2019 surface O3 \nconcentrations during the study period over the south-eastern subtropical Atlantic \nOcean.\nRecent site-specific studies of changes in \u2018background\u2019 O3 concentrations in Europe \nhave been concentrated around the margins of the continent. Measurements in Finland \nfrom 1989 to 2001 show non-significant increases in average O3 concentrations in \ndaytime hours between May and July, but (non-significant) decreases in the 99th \npercentile (peak) concentrations (Laurila et al., 2004). However, there were highly \nsignificant increases in O3 concentrations in unpolluted air masses at several sites, of \naround 0.5 ppb y-1. A broader study of measurement data, including sites in Finland, \nNorway and Sweden, was combined with a modelling exercise in an attempt to \n5\/24\ninterpret the measurement data (Solberg et al., 2005). Again, the data considered were \nfrom the summer months, and the daily maxima (hourly average) were used, being \nthought to be more representative of the well-mixed boundary layer than longer-term \naverages. Significant downward trends in the 99th percentile daily maxima were noted \nfor southern Norway and southern Sweden, but not for southern Finland, from 1990 to \n2000. These confirm earlier data for the United Kingdom (NEGTAP, 2001), which \nshowed a significant downward trend in peak concentrations from the 1970s to the \n1990s. \nA major study in Europe was published as a report in 2005 (Monks, 2005), pulling \ntogether data and modelling studies from across the whole of Europe. The report \nshowed that European emissions of O3 precursors had decreased over the past 3 \ndecades (by between 20 and 40% for NOx, with even larger reductions in Russia), and \nthat peak O3 concentrations had also decreased, but not in a linear fashion compared \nwith emissions reductions; although peak concentrations at some sites had decreased \nby between 1 and 1.5% per year  during the 1990s, average wintertime low \nconcentrations had systematically increased, particularly in central Europe, attributed \nto the reduction of the titration of O3 by nitric oxide (NO) caused by reduced NO \nemissions. The average O3 concentration in unpolluted \u2018background\u2019 air had also \nincreased, particularly in northern and western Europe, and in winter. However,  the \nvariability in weather patterns from year to year leads to a varying contribution of \nurban plumes at remote sites which can confound long-term trends, especially as it \nhas been shown that the springtime maximum in average O3 concentrations across \nEurope has a large contribution from O3 formation in polluted European air (Monks, \n2000). However, the report concluded that direct and measurable changes in mean O3 \nconcentrations that are attributable to emissions reductions are small, especially in the \ncontext of high year-to-year variability.\nSome of the most detailed recent studies come from the western fringes of Europe, \nlooking at the trends in O3 concentrations in both polluted and unpolluted air masses \nat a coastal site on the west coast of Ireland, at Mace Head (Derwent et al., 2007; \nSimmonds et al., 2004). A significant increase in O3 concentrations in background \n(unpolluted) air was seen from 1987 to 2007, of 0.31 \u00b1 0.12 ppb y-1, with a larger \naverage increase from 1987 to 1999 followed by a period with little overall trend. The \nincrease in background air varied seasonally, with largest changes in spring and \nsmallest in summer. Anomalously large concentrations in some years (1998-99) were \nattributed to large-scale emissions of O3 precursors from boreal forest fires. In \nregionally polluted air masses from Europe, smaller increases were seen, with no \nincrease in the summertime production of O3. These data confirm earlier reports of \nstable or decreasing O3 concentrations in summertime O3 peak concentrations, e.g. \n(Bronnimann et al., 2002; Derwent et al., 2003; NEGTAP, 2001). An independent \nstatistical analysis of the Mace Head data, separating long-term trends from seasonal \nvariations, showed different behaviour depending on the air mass origin (Carslaw, \n2005). In unpolluted background air the seasonal amplitude has increased, between \nthe springtime maximum and the summer minimum, largely driven by a decrease in \nthe summer minimum. Seasonal patterns of O3 concentration in polluted air masses \nsuggest a steadily decreasing influence of polluted air from Europe at this site. The \nsource of air mass dictates the seasonal variation in O3 \u2013 this may have implications \nfor the future, as changes in emission patterns, and changes in weather patterns as a \nresult of climate change, may influence the seasonal patterns. A similar type of study \n6\/24\nin Switzerland (Pochanart et al., 2001) used the residence time of air masses over \npolluted regions of Europe to categorise surface O3 concentrations measured at Arosa \nin 1996-1997, and showed very different seasonal cycles for polluted and unpolluted \nair. The \u2018background\u2019 seasonal cycle at Arosa was very similar to that at Mace Head, \nsuggesting a regional scale pattern of concentration in unpolluted air.\nSimilar trends to those reported for western Europe are seen at the west coast of North \nAmerica, where 7 out of 9 sites showed an average O3 increase between 1987 and \n2004 of 0.26 ppb y-1 (Jaffe et al., 2003; Jaffe and Ray, 2007). No trends could be seen \nin vertical profiles from ozonesonde measurements, but this was attributed to the \nvariability in the data set caused by irregular sampling intervals. \nStatistical techniques for determining temporal trends\nAlthough many analyses have used simple linear regression on maximum or average \nvalues to establish temporal trends, perhaps separated by season, more rigorous \nstatistical techniques have also been applied, taking into account factors that might \ninfluence O3 concentrations on similar timescales. Such approaches have been \ndeveloped because of the large year-to-year variability in patterns of O3 concentration. \nFor example, the frequency distribution of the whole dataset has been used to \ncharacterise temporal changes (Lin et al., 2000); these results suggested an increase in \nthe O3 transported from outside the United States as a contributory factor to increasing \nrural background concentrations in the United States. In an alternative approach, the \nsystematic seasonal variation of O3 concentrations within a year may be removed \nprior to trend analysis (Jaffe and Ray, 2007). When considering periods as short as a \ndecade, systematic variations in climate may be responsible for changes in O3 \nconcentration that might otherwise be ascribed to changes in precursor emissions, so \ncare must be taken when using statistical analysis alone when ascribing potential \ncausal factors. For example, at a global scale, analysis of satellite records of \ntropospheric O3 shows inter-annual variability that is correlated with the El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 \nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) in some parts of the tropics such as northern India \n(Fishman et al., 2005).\nThe dependence of average O3 concentrations on meteorological conditions is already \nwell established. For example, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network \napproach to separating the effects of meteorological variability on O3 data showed \nshort-term downward trends in summer daily maximum O3 concentration at sites in \nthe UK (Gardner and Dorling, 2000). A more conventional time-series analysis of \ndata from Switzerland, taking account of meteorological variability, which varied \nfrom site to site, suggested an increasing trend of around 1 ppb y-1 in summer \nafternoon peak concentrations, which was attributed to an increase in background O3 \nconcentrations (Bronnimann et al., 2002). A subsequent study of Swiss O3 data used \nan analysis of covariance to establish the influence of meteorological variability on \ndaily maximum O3 concentrations at 12 sites between 1992 and 2002 (Ordonez et al., \n2005). In spring and summer, the most important meteorological variables were \nafternoon temperature and morning global radiation, whereas in winter, factors that \naffected vertical mixing (e.g. afternoon global radiation, wind speed, stability) were \nmore important. The number of days after a frontal passage (i.e. after air has been \nwell mixed) was important to account for O3 production in summer and loss in winter. \nApplication of the meteorological model greatly reduced the inter-annual variability \nin meteorologically adjusted daily maxima, and showed that there was no significant \n7\/24\ndecrease in summer maxima, despite reductions in emissions of European precursors. \nIn autumn and winter, a small positive increase in O3 concentrations could be the \nresult of reduced NO emissions (and removal of O3 by \u2018titration\u2019 \u2013 see Figure 1), but \nthere was an increase in the sum of O3 and NO2 (collectively known as \u2018Ox\u2019) \nsuggesting that this trend was not simply the result of reduced titration, but \ndemonstrated a real increase in winter background O3 concentrations across Europe. \nThe strength of the statistical model was demonstrated by good predictions of the \nextreme O3 concentrations observed in 2003, which was the warmest summer in \nSwitzerland for over a century. \nA study of datasets from 7 sites in Paris, France, involving extreme value statistics \nhighlighted the importance of non-linearities in such data (Bellanger and Tomassone, \n2004). The authors looked at the frequency of exceedance of a threshold O3 \nconcentration of 130 \u03bcg m-3 (ca. 65 ppbV) between 1988 and 2001, and concluded \nthat there was an important increasing trend for exceedance time, although the size of \nthe exceedance showed a small decrease. This type of analysis provides useful \ninformation for assessing the potential effects of O3 \u2018episodes\u2019 on plants, as not only \nthe degree of exposure, but also the duration is described, giving a better estimate of \nthe likely uptake of O3 by leaves.\nA stratified approach to the detection of long-term O3 trends has been applied to data \nfrom the city of Bologna, Italy, between 1994 and 2002, utilising climatic data to \nestimate standardised trends (Cocchi et al., 2005). The analysis showed the necessity \nof applying such techniques in order to remove the year-to-year variability in daily O3 \nconcentration maxima caused by variations in climate. No clear long-term trends in \nthe data were identified for the relatively short period examined.\nComplex statistical analyses have also been applied recently to O3 data from North \nAmerica, incorporating both spatial and temporal information. One study (Lehman et \nal., 2004) used principal components analysis to group observations across the eastern \nUnited States, showing that different regions have different characteristic seasonal \ncycles in O3 concentration, and different characteristic persistence of O3 \nconcentrations. The authors suggest the use of statistical techniques to identify regions \nshowing similar characteristics, rather than geographical or political boundaries, when \nassessing long-term trends or the influence of climate on O3 concentrations. The \ninteraction between meteorology and O3 has recently been examined for the south-\neastern United States (O'Connor et al., 2005), based on the average daily maximum \nconcentration in each month between April and October from 1980 to 1994. This \nshowed that maximum O3 concentrations were positively correlated with temperature \nand inversely correlated with relative humidity in July and August. High O3 \nconcentrations were also associated with the number of days with high pressure \nstagnation. Using a similar approach, urban O3 trends across the United States were \nshown to be closely related to meteorological conditions, but in a manner which \nvaried across the country (Camalier et al., 2007). In the north and east, increasing O3 \nconcentrations were associated with increasing temperatures, particularly over 20 \u00b0C, \nwhereas in the south, increasing O3 concentrations were more closely correlated with \ndecreasing humidity.\n8\/24\nCauses of long-term trends in ozone\nSeveral factors have been suggested as responsible for the observed trends. The \npossibilities include:\n\u2022 Changes in anthropogenic emissions of precursors (both regional and global)\n\u2022 Effects of biomass burning (both regional and global)\n\u2022 Changes in stratosphere-troposphere exchange\n\u2022 Changes in geographical emission patterns\n\u2022 Changes in air-mass transport patterns\nIn practice, it is very difficult to be categorical about the causes of long-term trends at \na particular site. For example, at Mace Head the long-term trends have been attributed \nto hemispheric changes in methane, changes in patterns of transport of polluted air \nfrom continental Europe, and large biomass burning emissions from Siberia and North \nAmerica (Derwent et al., 2007). The most likely causes of the trends in O3 \nconcentrations in western North America were identified as regional biomass burning \nand long-range transport from Asia (Jaffe and Ray, 2007). The increasing trends in O3 \nconcentrations over Taiwan were attributed to decreasing \u2018titration\u2019 by emissions of \nNO (Chou et al., 2006), with important implications for urban emission control \npolicies.\nOn a broader spatial scale, changes in the transport of O3 from the stratosphere to the \ntroposphere may also be important; there is some evidence from measurements and \nmodels that increasing O3 concentrations in the lower stratosphere (particularly in the \nNorthern Hemisphere) may have led to increasing transport to the troposphere (Fusco \nand Logan, 2003; Ordonez et al., 2007; Tarasick et al., 2005).\nDetecting trends in O3 concentrations is only the first step in attributing causes, and \nalthough techniques such as separating \u2018polluted\u2019 and \u2018unpolluted\u2019 air masses may \nhelp in interpreting the observations, research has turned to chemistry\/transport \nmodels of the atmosphere to try to understand past and current trends, and to provide \nprojections into the future. Vingarzan (2004) cites several studies of the historical \nchanges in O3 concentrations based on computer models of emissions, reactions and \ntransport of precursor molecules and photo-oxidation products in the atmosphere. The \nconclusion from these global models was that the largest single cause of increased O3 \nconcentrations from the 1970s on a global scale is the anthropogenic emission of \nnitrogen oxides (NOx) from the combustion of fossil fuels. Global increases in \nmethane concentrations may also have played a role. \nThe use of chemistry-transport models to interpret past trends\nThere have been several modelling studies designed specifically to investigate the \nreasons for the observed trends in O3 concentrations. Changes in NOx and VOC \nemissions in a detailed chemical trajectory model (Derwent et al., 2003) predicted the \ndownward trend in peak European O3 concentrations and attributed this to reductions \nin European emissions of VOCs rather than NOx. A different type of model, based on \ncalculating the chemical transformations of emitted pollutants on a regional scale \nusing a 44 km x 44 km horizontal grid and 16 vertical layers, examined the likely \neffects of European emission reductions during the 1990s on surface O3 episodes in \nNordic countries (Solberg et al., 2005). Although modelled data were scattered \ncompared with measurements, a reduction in the 99th percentile (highest) O3 \nconcentrations of around 7.5 ppb was estimated for southern Norway and southern \nSweden during the 1990s. A modelling study of the spatial variability in O3 \n9\/24\nconcentrations across the continental United States demonstrated some of the \nproblems of reconciling model data with measurements, noting the importance of \naveraging times in assessing how well a model describes reality (Tong and Mauzerall, \n2006).\nLong-term trends (going back to the 19th century) have been simulated in global \nchemistry and transport models, and show how the budgets and fluxes of O3 have \nchanged in response to emission changes (Lamarque et al., 2005; Lelieveld and \nDentener, 2000), with a net increase in the tropospheric O3 burden of around 30%. \nThe results (Figure 2) illustrate the general principles that are shown by most models: \nstratosphere-troposphere exchange (a source of O3) is similar in magnitude to dry \ndeposition (loss of O3) at the earth\u2019s surface, with photochemical production and \ndestruction within the atmosphere accounting for most of the O3 turnover, but being \nalmost in balance. The absolute production and destruction rates both increased \ngreatly over the century, and the net O3 production term shows the largest differences \nbetween the two models cited. This shows why relatively small changes in \natmospheric chemical conditions can lead to much larger changes in O3 budgets, and \nthe overall O3 concentration in the troposphere. \n-5000\n-4000\n-3000\n-2000\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nphotochem prodn strat-trop exchange\nphotochem loss dry deposition\nnet photochemistry\n1860\n1993\nTg O3 y-1 A\n \n10\/24\n-5000\n-4000\n-3000\n-2000\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\nphotochem prodn strat-trop exchange\nphotochem loss dry deposition\nnet photochemistry\nB\n1890\n1990\nTg O3 y-1\n \nFigure 2:  Calculated global ozone fluxes (Tg y-1) in 19th and 20th centuries. \nComparison of model outputs showing long-term historical changes in ozone \nproduction and loss. In both cases the chemical \u2018turnover\u2019 of ozone in the \ntroposphere has greatly increased since the 19th century. Small differences in the \nmodels lead to a difference in the sign of current net ozone production globally, \nillustrating model sensitivity to details of the chemistry schemes used. \nA: 1863-1993 (Lelieveld & Dentener, 2000). B: 1890-1990 (Lamarque et al., 2005)\nModels have proved very useful in understanding the influence of inter-continental \ntransport, particularly the dynamics of the different levels in the atmosphere at which \npollutants are transported. This is well illustrated in a recent model (Wild and \nAkimoto, 2001), in which the authors noted the distinction between local tropospheric \nproduction of O3 followed by transport, as opposed to the vertical transport of \nprecursors (e.g. through deep convection) followed by O3 production in the upper \ntroposphere and subsequent transport of O3 to the surface. The latter route is more \nimportant for emissions from east Asia, and was shown to have the potential to affect \nsurface O3 concentrations significantly in both North America and Europe. \nConversely, the greatest contribution of U.S. emissions to Europe appears to be from \nlow-level transport of O3 directly.\nOf the more recent models, a Lagrangian model (Derwent et al., 2004) used a \nlabelling technique to mark the origins of O3 formed within the troposphere over \nEurope. The model showed a seasonal summer maximum over the Mediterranean, \nwith a spring maximum in the north and west of Europe. The contribution to annual \naverage O3 concentrations from different sources were: stratosphere-troposphere \nexchange, 7 ppb (18%); European sources, 20 ppb (50%); N. American sources, 8 ppb \n(20%) and Asia, 5 ppb (11%). Intercontinental transport from North America and \nAsia contributed more to O3 concentrations over Europe than did stratosphere-\ntroposphere exchange in all months except December and February. Increases in NOx \n11\/24\nemissions in North America and Asia increased O3 concentrations on the western edge \nof Europe but had little effect in central Europe. An Eulerian model (Auvray and Bey, \n2005) quantified the contribution of long-range transport to Europe for 1997. Trans-\nAtlantic transport was dominated by mid-latitude cyclones transporting material to \nEurope in the upper troposphere. There was a strong seasonal pattern, with highest \ntransport in spring in northern latitudes and in summer further south, matching the \nobserved pattern of surface O3 at remote sites in the north and west of Europe. The \neffects of Asian emissions were observed throughout the year, with a summer \nmaximum at 8-12 km correlated with the monsoon season and increases in lightning-\nderived NOx. Budget calculations in the troposphere over Europe showed an 11% \ncontribution of North American sources, and an 8% contribution of Asian sources, \nwith only a 9% contribution from European sources for this particular year (1997). \nThis budget conceals vertical differences; surface O3 concentrations have a much \nstronger dependence on local emissions, and are predicted to have declined in \nresponse to decreases in precursor emissions. However, mid- and upper troposphere \nconcentrations are predicted to have increased, influenced by increased \nintercontinental fluxes of O3. \nThe trends in European O3 levels have been studied more explicitly using the EMEP \nregional photochemistry model (Jonson et al., 2006), run for the years 1990 and \n1995-2002. Possible causes for the observed trends were investigated using different \nemission scenarios and boundary conditions in the model. The possible explanations \nfor changes in surface O3 over the decade were described and evaluated, drawing \nattention to differences between summer and winter, and between high and low \naltitude sites. Reference was made to the results of similar modelling studies as part of \nthe TROTREP project (Monks, 2005). A positive trend in winter O3 was observed, in \nresponse to decreased NOx emissions and increasing \u2018background\u2019 contributions, but \nwith no clear picture at other times of year. However, the increase in \u2018background\u2019 O3 \nis not well explained by the model in terms of long-range transport. International \nshipping emissions were suggested as a possible contributory factor, along with large-\nscale boreal fires in Siberia and North America. The authors concluded that \nhemispheric circulation patterns may also be changing on similar timescales, so that \n\u201cthe magnitude and origin of O3 trends in Europe are not completely understood.\u201d\nA similar global study (Sudo and Akimoto, 2007) used tracers in a model to show that \nO3 formed in the Asian free troposphere contributed to the overall concentrations in \nthe northern hemisphere, and globally, and that there was free tropospheric transport \nof O3 from the southern to the northern hemisphere. Ozone formation in the southern \nhemisphere is dominated by emissions from biomass burning. Of the global burden of \ntropospheric O3 of 344 Tg, 48% came from chemical reactions in source regions, 29% \nfrom formation over remote regions, and 23% from stratosphere-troposphere \nexchange. Regional budgets calculated from a global model showed a similar pattern, \nwith precursors in the outflow from continents leading to net O3 production in remote \nregions (O'Connor et al., 2004). Recent models have looked at the specific regional \nand global impact of emissions from a particular area; for example, the O3 produced \nfrom African emissions contributes significantly to tropospheric O3 across the whole \ntropics (Aghedo et al., 2007).\nThe different types of model and differing results have prompted detailed \ncomparisons and discussions of why differences arise in models, in particular why \n12\/24\nmore recent models consistently show a higher tropospheric burden of O3 (ca. 340 Tg) \nthan earlier models (ca. 300 Tg). (Wild, 2007; Wu et al., 2007). Although some of the \ndifferences can be attributed to changes in the emissions of precursors (especially \nbiogenic VOCs) used in the models, as knowledge of emissions has improved, other \nfactors such as the model definition of the tropopause height (which affects \nstratosphere-troposphere exchange), the formulation of wet and dry deposition \nprocesses, the role of clouds and the contribution of lightning are also important, as \nare scaling issues. In a sensitivity study in which some of these factors were varied \nsystematically, keeping everything else constant, the effects on the tropospheric O3 \nburden (Tg) were calculated as shown in Table 1 (Wild, 2007). These are global \nvalues \u2013 regional changes may be much greater, and not all sources of uncertainty \nwere covered in this sensitivity study. Broad-scale spatial models (both in the \nhorizontal and the vertical) were shown to overestimate stratosphere-troposphere \nexchange, underestimate dry deposition and underestimate net chemical production \ncompared to models at finer spatial scales. Year-to-year variations in meteorology \nalso can cause significant changes in ozone budgets and spatial distribution, so that \ncomparisons of model outputs that use different model years may confound the \ndifferences in model structures and operation with differences in input data.\nTable 1.

Model predictions of future scenarios have taken \nseveral different approaches, but there are few studies that have fully integrated all the \npotential interactions. Some models use current climate along with projected emission \nincreases to predict future ozone concentrations; others look at the effects of projected \nclimate change on ozone formation under current emission patterns; one or two \nstudies look at the combined effects of changing emissions and changing climate \ntogether, but few, if any, studies have incorporated all the feedbacks between \npredicted ozone (and other photochemical products such as aerosols) and climate in a \ncombined model of chemistry, transport, emissions and climate.\nAlthough it is tempting to use models to investigate the effects of changes in one or \nmore model inputs in isolation (e.g. modelling the effects of different future emission \nscenarios using \u2018fixed\u2019 climatic conditions), the complexities and feedbacks between \nchemical processes, radiative forcing and climatic patterns mean that such studies can \nbe misleading. As a simple example \u2013 changing emissions while keeping constant \n13\/24\nclimatic conditions suggests very large increases in global tropospheric O3, depending \non the particular emissions scenario chosen (Prather et al., 2003). However, changing \nclimate conditions to a warmer and wetter world in future decades, while keeping \nemissions of O3 precursors at present-day levels, leads to a decrease in global \ntropospheric O3 (Stevenson et al., 2005). Similar patterns were seen in a comparison \nof an ensemble of models of current and future climates (Stevenson et al., 2006). The \noverall effect of increased emissions and increased temperatures approximately \ncancelled out on a global scale, but there were large regional differences, with some \nareas experiencing increased concentrations, and some decreased. The authors also \nhighlight the difficulty with such large-scale models in accurately predicting surface \nconcentrations. The vertical (and horizontal) mixing of precursors within grid cells, \nwhich is \u2018instantaneous\u2019 in the models, leads to greater homogeneity than is \nexperienced in the real world, and consequently leads to an upwards bias in modelled \nsurface O3 concentrations. This criticism can be applied to all grid-based models, \nespecially those on a global scale with large grid cells. Other potential sources of error \nwere highlighted, including large differences among models in deposition rates over \ndifferent terrains, and inadequate handling of convection, which would particularly \naffect the distribution and fate of highly water-soluble species such as nitric acid \n(HNO3) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Figure 1). Convection also determines the \noccurrence of lightning and consequent NOx generation, which is poorly defined. \nSeasonal patterns in the model output are driven by climate, rather than seasonal \nchanges in emissions. For the whole troposphere, changes in O3 burden were broadly \nproportional to changes in NOx emissions, although this was not expected. Surface O3 \nconcentrations decreased in response to changing climate, particularly over the \ntropical oceans, with an overall decrease in average \u2018lifetime\u2019 of an O3 molecule in the \ntroposphere. The most important climate-chemistry feedbacks concern water vapour \nand stratosphere-troposphere exchange, although these have different sensitivities in \nthe different models used in the comparison. It must also be recognised that current \nmodels do not always represent accurately present-day conditions, especially in the \ntropics; a recent set of measurements found much smaller concentrations above a \nrainforest than predicted by the model used, suggesting not all of the chemical \nreactions were correctly included in the model (Kuhn et al., 2007).\nNew model studies and predictions of future ozone concentrations in the troposphere \nare appearing every year. Table 2 lists some recent examples. Rather than attempt to \ndescribe each in detail, the key variables that can be manipulated in a modelling \nexercise are given below, with reference to Figure 3, which shows the more important \ninteractions and feedbacks which ought to be considered in such models.\n14\/24\nTable 2.

Increases in \nCO2 concentrations affect climate, but also directly affect plants and therefore \nbiogenic VOC emissions and O3 deposition. Changes in land use play a large role \nin determining the pattern of future emissions and deposition, and future ozone \nconcentrations. Regional effects are likely to be larger than overall global effects, \nbut are not yet well represented by global models, which consider some, but not \nall, of the possible interactions.\n15\/24\n \nLand use \nAgriculture \nand Forestry \nBiomass burning \nFerilizer use \nTemperature \nWater\/drought \nWildfires \nStorm damage \nSpecies change \nHabitat change \nBVOC emissions \nOzone \nSOAerosol \nNH 3 ,  NOx SO 2 \nNitrates, sulphates, PM \nMethane \nClimate forcing \nClimate \nIndustry\/transport \nNOx , SO 2 , PM \nVOC emissions \nCO 2 \nNitrous \noxide \nInsect damage \nWater vapour \nStrat - trop exchange \nDry \ndeposition \nCO2 \nFactors affecting future ozone scenarios\nAnthropogenic emissions:\nThe IPCC Third Assessment report (IPCC, 2001) used a range of emission scenarios \nfor anthropogenic emissions of O3 precursors (NOx and VOCs) depending on a variety \nof predictions of economic growth. Assumptions were made as to which emissions \nreductions strategies might be effective, and of the overall global rates of economic \ngrowth and development of new technologies. The range of scenarios encompassed \nthe expected range of future anthropogenic emissions and were retained for the more \nrecent report (IPCC, 2007).\nBiogenic emissions:\nIncreased temperatures are predicted to increase emissions of biogenic VOCs, based \non measurements of the response of vegetation to short-term temperature changes \nunder controlled laboratory or field conditions (Guenther et al., 1995; Guenther et al., \n2006). However, the predicted effects of gradual temperature changes over decades, \nand the possibility of vegetation adapting to higher temperatures, is still uncertain, \nespecially if higher temperatures are associated with increased drought conditions, or \ninsect damage, both of which can also increase BVOC emissions (Pare and \nTumlinson, 1999; Pegoraro et al., 2005). Recent studies have also suggested that \nincreased CO2 concentrations may inhibit emissions of isoprene (one of the more \nimportant BVOCs for O3 formation) (Monson et al., 2007), but again, these \npredictions are based on relatively short-term experiments and it is not clear to what \nextent such responses are general to different plant species, or sustainable over \ndecades. Perhaps more importantly, future BVOC emissions are usually based on the \ncombination of increased emissions caused by increased temperatures and increased \nabove-ground biomass in response to increased CO2 concentrations. Increased \ndeposition of fixed nitrogen from the atmosphere, and applied as fertilizer, may also \nplay a role. However, most models assume that the pattern of vegetation types will \nremain approximately constant, or if changes are modelled, they are based on \npredictions of potential land uses under future climate regimes. The biggest changes \nin land use today are caused by shifts in agricultural patterns, for example, the move \ntowards biofuels, which occur rapidly (less than a decade) and may have a much \ngreater effect on BVOC emissions through species changes (e.g. conversion of \nrainforest to oil palms) than any changes predicted from increased temperatures alone \n(Wiedinmyer et al., 2006). Changing agricultural patterns are also likely to produce \nchanges in climate forcing through increased fertilizer use and soil emissions of the \nradiatively active gas nitrous oxide (N2O), although quantitative predictions remain \nuncertain (Crutzen et al., 2008).\nGlobal climate:\nThe increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases, primarily CO2, CH4 and N2O, are \nused to model the radiative forcing of the atmosphere, and consequential changes in \ntemperatures and humidity. Changes in temperature affect the rates of tropospheric \nreactions, so changing the rates at which O3 is formed and destroyed. Higher water \nvapour concentrations at higher temperatures lead to greater loss rates of O3 from \nphotolysis and OH formation, and consequently higher OH concentrations, which in \nturn leads to faster turnover of VOCs. However, O3 itself is also a radiatively active \ngas, so changes in O3 concentrations feed back into climate forcing patterns (Gauss et \nal., 2003). Changes in the oxidising capacity of the troposphere, intimately related to \n16\/24\nO3 concentrations, also change rates of formation of airborne particles from both \nanthropogenic and biogenic emissions. The combined effects of increased particle \nconcentrations and increased humidity on cloud formation, and the resultant direct \nand indirect effects on climate forcing are still very uncertain.\nStratosphere-troposphere exchange:\nDifficulties in modelling the tropopause have already been mentioned (Wild, 2007). \nRecent studies suggest that sea-surface temperatures affect the rate of stratosphere-\ntroposphere exchange (Olsen et al., 2007), thereby affecting O3 transport from above \ninto the troposphere. However, other studies show that the rate of exchange, and the \namounts of O3 entering the troposphere from the stratosphere, are highly variable and \ndepend on climatic circulation patterns (Collins et al., 2003; Ordonez et al., 2007). \nDry and wet deposition:\nIncreased tropospheric humidity implies, if not greater overall wet deposition, then \nchanges in patterns of precipitation, leading to changes in wet removal of material \n(including oxidants) from the atmosphere. Although this may not be particularly \nimportant for O3, dry deposition of the gas at the earth\u2019s surface is affected by surface \nwetness (Altimir et al., 2006; Grantz et al., 1995; Lamaud et al., 2002), and by the \nstate of vegetation, in particular its uptake through stomata. Increased CO2 \nconcentrations may inhibit O3 uptake directly, by reducing stomatal conductance \n(Harmens et al., 2007; Sanderson et al., 2007; Tausz et al., 2007). Conversely, \nincreased O3 concentrations may damage vegetation and inhibit CO2 uptake, leading \nto feedback effects on tropospheric CO2 concentrations (Felzer et al., 2005; Sitch et \nal., 2007). Dry deposition of O3 to external plant surfaces is still not well understood, \nbut the process is known to be at least as important as stomatal uptake, at least for \nmid-latitudes, and has been shown to increase with increasing temperatures (Altimir \net al., 2004; Gerosa et al., 2005; Hogg et al., 2007; Mikkelsen et al., 2004). These \nsurface effects have not yet been included in global models.\nImplications for plant exposures to ozone\nIn addition to the implications for plant health of changes in O3 concentrations and \nchanges in climate, the implications of the climate\/ozone interactions need to be \nconsidered (Ashmore, 2005; Bytnerowicz et al., 2007; Karnosky et al., 2005). One of \nthe most important is the interaction with plant development, i.e. the relationship \nbetween the occurrence of peak O3 concentrations and phenology. In general, it may \nbe supposed that an overall increasing global mean temperature would advance the \nonset of budburst and flowering of many temperate plant species, as appears to be the \ncase (Badeck et al., 2004). This has implications for O3 effects if the timing of peak \nO3 exposure is likely to change in future. In Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes the \npeak in O3 concentrations in unpolluted air is in spring, whereas the peak O3 \nconcentrations in polluted air are in summer. There will therefore be a shift in the \ncoincidence between a particular developmental stage and maximum O3 exposure \nwhich depends on the relative influence of polluted and unpolluted air at a site. If \ncirculation patterns change, as predicted (Murazaki and Hess, 2006), then the seasonal \npatterns of O3 concentration for a given site may in future be rather different from \nthose observed over the past decade or so. So little is known at present about the \nrelative sensitivities of the different stages of plant growth and development across \ndifferent species that it is not possible to predict whether changes in patterns of O3 \nexposure will be positive or negative (Emberson et al., 2000).\n17\/24\nApart from alterations in timing, the potential effects of other aspects of a changing \nclimate on O3 effects can be predicted with slightly more certainty. Increased \ntemperatures are likely to affect plant development (Pleijel et al., 2000), changing the \nperiod over which current indices of exposure are calculated. Drier conditions will \ndecrease stomatal uptake of O3 \u2013 a factor that is already apparent as important in \ninterpreting different responses to exposure across Europe (from north to south), as \nmeasured by an index like the AOT40 rather than one based on O3 uptake rate. \nIncreased CO2 concentrations will tend to decrease stomatal conductance, and reduce \nO3 uptake rates for similar exposures (Tausz et al., 2007). Increased CO2 uptake may \nprovide additional photosynthate for damage repair, thereby increasing the apparent \nthreshold uptake rate of O3 which can be tolerated, but no general relationship \nbetween CO2 uptake rate and O3 resistance has been demonstrated. Although there are \nsome experimental indications that such an interaction operates in the field (Karnosky \net al., 2003), too little is known yet to make generalisations across all vegetation \ntypes, even for Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude species and ecosystems. Perhaps \nthe most important factor to draw from the modelling of ozone-climate interactions is \nthe regional differences in O3 and climate that are predicted. For example, increased \nhumidity over the central U.S. may have a strong effect on stomatal conductance and \nuptake of O3, even though predicted O3 concentrations and exposure in that region \nmay not increase very greatly (Murazaki and Hess, 2006).\nOne of the interactions that has received very little attention is the predicted large rise \nin concentrations in the atmosphere of photo-oxidants other than O3. Although \ngenerally higher temperatures are likely to reduce concentrations of peroxyacetyl \nnitrate (PAN) (Stevenson et al., 2005), large increases are predicted in concentrations \nof the hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) \n(Murazaki and Hess, 2006; Stevenson et al., 2005). Although these highly reactive \nchemical species have not been demonstrated to cause deleterious effects under \npresent-day conditions, the potential for future impacts is not known (Cape, 1997). \nConclusions\nIncreased emissions of O3 precursors globally, and in particular in the rapidly \ndeveloping region of south and east Asia, have raised concerns over regional O3 \nproduction, and long-range transport throughout the Northern Hemisphere. These \nconcerns have been fuelled by observations of increasing concentrations of O3 at \nremote sites in the U.S. and Europe, particularly in winter. Regional controls on \nprecursor emissions of NOx, and particularly of VOCs, have produced little \nmeasurable effect on average O3 concentrations, but have reduced the magnitude of \npeak O3 concentrations during photochemical \u2018episodes\u2019. However, these changes are \nsmall relative to the inter-annual variability, which is strongly driven by climate, \nmaking the identification of consistent trends difficult.\nApplication of multivariate statistics to separate the effects of climate from a time \ntrend have successfully accounted for much of the inter-annual variability, on the \nbasis of temperature, humidity and a number of other site-dependent parameters. \nRemoving these sources of variation has made it easier to detect the long-term \nunderlying trends at sites influenced by polluted and unpolluted air. The results from \nthese adjusted data are similar to those detected at remote sites \u2013 increases in low O3 \n18\/24\nconcentrations in winter, and a slowing down of the summer day-time increases that \nhad been observed since the 1970s.\nThe use of chemistry-transport numerical models, on regional and global scales, has \nshown the extent to which inter-continental transport of O3 and its precursors can \noccur. Ozone may be exported from polluted regions within the boundary layer, or \nprecursors may be entrained into the free troposphere through deep convection, \nespecially over continents, and transported around the globe, before eventually being \nbrought back to the earth\u2019s surface. During transport, precursors react to form \nelevated O3 concentrations.\nPredicted (modelled) changes in emissions of precursors over the next 20-50 years \nimply serious increases in O3 concentrations across the whole Northern Hemisphere, \nto levels that would significantly affect both natural vegetation and crop yields. \nHowever, on these time-scales it is also predicted (modelled) that there will be subtle \nbut important changes in climate that will act to mitigate the effects of increased \nprecursor emissions on O3 formation. In particular, although increased temperatures \nare likely to increase emissions of biogenic VOCs (an important O3 precursor), most \nO3 production is limited by the availability of NOx. Increased temperatures also \nincrease the water vapour concentrations in the atmosphere, leading to faster O3 \ndestruction, greater production of OH radicals, and consequent faster oxidation of \nozone precursors (VOCs and NOx). However, O3 concentrations are predicted to \nincrease significantly in future, even taking into account climatic changes, in regions \nwhere NOx concentrations are high, but may decrease where NOx emissions are low.\nThe strong dependence of surface O3 concentrations on weather patterns and year-to-\nyear changes in climate means that inter-annual variability will continue to be a \nfeature of O3 exposure, making the detection of long-term trends difficult from \nmeasurements alone. Models have helped to separate the different confounding \nfactors involved in linking emissions to O3 production, and show the importance of \nregional climate and global circulation on the end result. However, the spatial scale of \nglobal models, particularly the vertical resolution, is still sufficiently coarse that \naccurate predictions of O3 exposure cannot yet be made, even for present-day \nconditions, at spatial scales relevant to predicting effects at a specific site.\nReferences\nAghedo AM, Schultz MG, Rast S.
