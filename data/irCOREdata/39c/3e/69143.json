The air data show a strong decline with latitude with the highest polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in Europe and the lowest in the Arctic. \u03a3ICES PCBs in air range from 100 pg m\u22123 near Norway to 0.8 pg m\u22123 in the Arctic. A comparison with other data from previous and ongoing land-based air measurements in the Arctic region suggests no clear temporal decline of PCBs in the European Arctic since the mid-1990s. Dissolved concentrations of \u03a36PCBs (28\/31, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153) in surface seawater were <1 pg L\u22121.

Res., 113, D19302,\ndoi:10.1029\/2007JD009750.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are industrial\nchemicals that have been used in most industrialized\ncountries. Production of PCBs peaked in the 1960s in\nEurope and the United States. They were ultimately banned\nin the late 1970s\/early 1980s [de Voogt and Brinkman,\n1989]. The most recent inventory of PCB production\nestimates the cumulative global production of PCBs at\n1.3 million tons [Breivik et al., 2007]. Approximately\n97% of this has been used in the Northern Hemisphere,\nmostly between 30\u0001N and 60\u0001N [Breivik et al., 2002]. PCBs\nare persistent, ubiquitous, and prone to undergo long-range\natmospheric transport (LRAT). As a result, they have been\nfound in the Arctic [Bidleman et al., 1999; Harner et al.,\n1998; Stern et al., 1997] and shown to bioaccumulate and\nbiomagnify in marine mammals, polar bears, and humans\n[Kucklick and Baker, 1998; Halsall et al., 1998]. There is\nconcern for the health of indigenous Arctic people and\nwildlife, due to the toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumula-\ntion potential of these compounds [Gilman et al., 1997].\nTheir regulation has become an international policy issue\nbased upon their possible effects on human health and\npotential environmental risks [United Nations Economic\nCommission for Europe, 1998].\n[3] The atmosphere has been regarded as the most\nimportant and rapid route of transport for PCBs to the\nArctic. Wania and Mackay [1993] put forward the hypoth-\nesis that the more volatile congeners would be transported\nand condensed in colder regions, while the less volatile\ncongeners would be deposited in warmer regions\/closer to\nsources. This would result in a relative enrichment of the\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, D19302, doi:10.1029\/2007JD009750, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Centre for Chemicals Management and Department of Environmental\nScience, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster,\nUK.\n2Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island,\nNarragansett, Rhode Island, USA.\n3Department of Environmental Chemistry, IIQAB-CSIC, Barcelona,\nSpain.\n4Department for Environmental Chemistry, Forschungszentrum\nGeesthacht GmbH Institute for Coastal Research, GKSS, Geesthacht,\nGermany.\n5Institute for Baltic Sea Research, Rostock, Germany.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JD009750$09.00\nD19302 1 of 11\nmore volatile compounds in colder (polar) areas over time.\nGlobal fractionation of chemicals depends on various\nphysical-chemical properties, processes such as deposition,\nvolatilization, and environmental variables. Many investi-\ngators have found evidence of fractionation of PCBs in\nenvironmental media such as air and seawater, but uncer-\ntainties remain over whether environmental reservoirs act as\nsources or sinks and whether primary or secondary sources\nare controlling the levels of PCBs in the environment\n[Meijer et al., 2003; Jaward et al., 2004; Sobek and\nGustafsson, 2004; Gioia et al., 2006]. Furthermore, frac-\ntionation (or a change in the mixture of PCBs) can also be\nthe result of other processes, such as enhanced removal or\nsettling of the more hydrophobic compounds, to the deep\nocean and degradation.\n[4] There are several studies reporting PCB concentra-\ntions in Arctic biota [e.g., Arctic Monitoring and Assess-\nment Program, 2004; Macdonald et al., 2000; Van Oostdam\net al., 1999]. Most data to date has been obtained as part of\nthe Canadian-operated Northern Contaminants Program\n[2003] and the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program\n(AMAP) [Hung et al., 2005]. However, there are very few\nstudies of their air and seawater concentrations over the\nopen oceans [Iwata et al., 1993; Schulz-Bull et al., 1988;\nHarner et al., 1998; Sobek and Gustafsson, 2004] despite\ntheir importance in supplying food chains and the regional\/\nglobal cycling of POPs.\n[5] Deep oceans are believed to be a final sink of these\npollutants, removing them from the \u2018\u2018recyclable pool\u2019\u2019 in the\nenvironment [Jurado et al., 2004; Dachs et al., 2002]. PCBs\ncan be removed from the atmosphere via air-to-water\nexchange, partition into organic matter in seawater, and\nremoved via carbon export to the deeper oceans [Dachs et\nal., 2002]. Knowledge of the equilibrium status and\/or net\ndirection of the flux between air and water is essential to\nunderstand the global cycle of these pollutants. Despite the\nimportance of partitioning between air and water for these\npollutants, few simultaneous air and seawater measurements\nover open oceans such as the Atlantic are reported in the\nliterature. This may be because of the difficulties in collect-\ning reliable air and seawater samples on board ships and the\nlarge volumes of seawater needed to detect PCBs.\n[6] This study presents air and seawater concentrations of\nPCBs from samples taken on the R\/V Polarstern during\nJune\u2013August 2004, during a cruise from Germany through\nthe Norwegian Sea, the Greenland Sea, and the Arctic\nOcean (see Figure 1). Mechanisms of PCB transport to\nand within the Arctic are investigated by looking at com-\npound concentrations and latitudinal variations in com-\npound mixtures. The state of equilibrium and net direction\nof flux between the air and the seawater is also discussed.\n2. Methodology\n2.1. Sample Collection\n[7] Air and seawater samples were collected on board the\nR\/V Polarstern (Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany) during\nJune\u2013August 2004 from 55\u0001N to 85\u0001N. A total of 37 air\nsamples were taken on the observation deck, 20 m above\nthe sea level, using a high-volume air sampler (Hi-Vol;\nTisch Environmental TE-PNY1123 accuvol modified PUF\nsampler, Factory Cleves, Ohio, USA) placed windward and\noperating at 0.25\u20130.27 m3\/min. Twelve to forty-eight hours\nintegrated air samples were collected ranging from 150 m3\nin the North Sea to 800 m3 in the Arctic Ocean. Particulate\nand gas phase compounds were captured on a glass fiber\nfilter (GFF, 110 mm diameter, Whatman International Ltd.,\nMaidstone, UK) and two polyurethane foam (PUF; 5 cm\ndiameter, 6.5 cm length, Klaus Ziemer GmbH, Langerwehe,\nGermany) plugs, respectively. The samplers were operated\nin \u2018\u2018good conditions,\u2019\u2019 when the relative wind direction was\nbetween 0\u0001\u201390\u0001 and 270\u0001\u20130\u0001 to avoid sampling air coming\nfrom the ship\u2019s funnel. After sampling, the PUFs and GFFs\nwere transferred into solvent rinsed aluminum tins and\nstored in freezers at \u000120\u0001C. These were analyzed at Lan-\ncaster University.\n[8] Seawater samples were collected from a stainless steel\npipe at 8 m depth, using the ship\u2019s intake system located in\nthe keel. The average flow rate was about 1.2 L min\u00011. Both\nparticle and dissolved seawater phases were collected using\na GFF (GF\/F 52 with 0.7 mm nominal pore size) and a\n95 mL XAD-2 resin (Supelco, Germany) column, respec-\ntively. After sampling, samples were stored at \u00014\u0001C until\nanalysis at the Institute for Baltic Sea Research (IOW).\n2.2. Processing of Air Samples\n[9] PUF plugs were preextracted with dichloromethane\n(DCM, HPLC grade, Fischer Scientific, Loughborough,\nUK) using a Dionex accelerated solvent extractor (Dionex\nUK Ltd, Surrey, UK), while GFFs were precombusted at\n450\u0001C. Samples were handled and extracted in a dedicated\nclean laboratory, which has filtered, charcoal-stripped air\nand positive pressure conditions. Each sample was spiked\nwith a recovery standard of 13C12 -labeled PCB congeners\n(13C-labeled PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180; CIL, Cam-\nbridge, USA) and extracted in a Buchi extraction unit (Lab\nPlant, Huddersfield, UK) for 18 h with hexane (HPLC\ngrade, Fischer Scientific, Loughborough, UK). The extracts\nwere concentrated using rotary evaporation and nitrogen\nevaporation. Each sample was eluted on a 9 mm id column\nwith 1 g alumina (BDH neutral Alumina, Merck, Darm-\nstadt, Germany), 2 g silica gel (Merck Silica 60, Darmstadt,\nGermany), and 1 cm of sodium sulphate (VWR, Pade, UK)\nall baked at 450\u0001C overnight. The extracts were then eluted\nthrough gel permeation columns containing 6 g of Biobeads\nSX 3 (BIO RAD Laboratory, Hercules, California, USA).\nEach sample was concentrated to about 100 mL under N2 gas\n(BOC Gases, Surrey, UK) and solvent exchanged to 25 mL\nof dodecane containing PCB 30 and [13C12] PCB 141 as\ninternal standards. The samples were analyzed by gas\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS Finnigan\nTrace by Thermo Fischer Scientific, Loughborough, UK)\nwith an EI+ source operating in selected ion mode (SIM).\nDetails of the instruments, temperature program, and mon-\nitored ions are given elsewhere [Thomas et al., 1998; Gouin\net al., 2002]. The following congeners were analyzed: tri-\nPCBs 18, 22, 28, and 31; tetra-PCBs 44, 49, 53, 70 and 74;\npenta-PCBs 87, 90\/101, 95, 99, 105, 110, 118 and 123; hexa-\nPCBs 138, 141, 149, 151, 153\/132 and 158; hepta-PCBs\n170, 174, 180, 183 and 187; octa-PCBs 194, 199 and 203.\n2.3. Processing of Seawater Samples\n[10] Water samples were processed at IOW. XAD resins\nwere precleaned by consecutive Soxhlet extractions with\nD19302 GIOIA ET AL.: PCBS IN THE EUROPEAN ARCTIC\n2 of 11\nD19302\nDCM, transferred into glass columns and rinsed with\ncopious amounts of water. XAD columns (two sets of\n15 IOW columns of \u00028 cm i.d., 20 cm length, and\n20 GSO columns of 3 cm i.d., 20 cm length) were capped\nand sealed in polyethylene bags. GFFs were precombusted\nat 450\u0001C for 12 h and wrapped in aluminum foil. After\nsampling, XAD cartridges were extracted in acetone, ex-\nchanged to hexane, dried over sodium sulphate, and con-\ncentrated by rotary evaporation to \u0002150 mL. GFFs were\nextracted twice by accelerated solvent extraction using\nhexane: acetone (60:40, V\/V) at a pressure of 140 bar at\n100\u0001C for 15 min. Extracts were combined, the water phase\nliquid-liquid extracted with hexane and the hexane phases\ncombined, dried over sodium sulphate, and concentrated by\nFigure 1.

Samples were cleaned up\non a Baker-Bond double column consisting of 3 g inacti-\nvated (15% water) aluminum oxide in the upper and 3 g\ninactivated silica (3.5% water) in the lower column. Sam-\nples were eluted with 12 ml hexane and 40 ml dichloro-\nmethane: hexane (1:9V\/V). The first fraction was used to\nanalyze PCBs. Prior to extraction, internal standards were\nadded (13C12-PCBs 28, 52, 101, 153, 138, 180, pp-DDE,\nand pp-DDT, all at 15 pg mL\u00011, deuterated PAHs at 100 pg\nmL\u00011). A XTI-5 30 m capillary column (inner diameter\n0.25mm, film thickness 0,25 mm; Restek, USA) was used\nto separate analytes in a Thermo Finnigian Trace GC -\nAutomass MS. A 2 mL sample was injected in a\nprogrammed temperature vaporizing (PTV) injector, which\nwas ramped from 50 to 280\u0001C at 10\u0001C s\u00011. The temperature\n(T) of the GC for PCBs and DDTs ramped from 50\u0001C\n(3.5 min) at 10\u0001C min\u00011 to 310\u0001C, where it was held for\n15 min.\n2.4. Quality Assurance\/Quality Control\n[11] All analytical procedures were monitored using strict\nquality assurance and control measures. Laboratory blanks,\ntravel blanks (media that just traveled), and field blanks\nconstituted 10%, 10%, and 30%, respectively, of the total\nnumber of samples for air. No analytes were detected in the\nlaboratory blanks (i.e., values were <1 pg mL\u00011 in 25 mL\nsample on column), showing there was no contamination\nduring sample processing in the laboratory. Travel blanks\nand field blanks showed similar compound concentration\n(i.e., <1 pg mL\u00011 in 25 mL sample on column) indicating\nminimal contamination during storage, sampling, and trans-\nport. Samples were blank corrected using the mean of the\nfield blanks. Method detection limits (MDL) were derived\nas the mean plus 3 times the standard deviation of the field\nblanks. Air sampling on the ship needs to be consistent and\nrespectful of strict quality control measures, in order to\navoid ship contamination and detect low levels of POPs in\nremote regions [Lohmann et al., 2004]. Passive air samplers\n(PUF disks) were deployed in different locations in and\non board the R\/V Polarstern to monitor the background\nair concentrations of the ship and to determine if the ship\nhad the potential to be a source of contamination for the\nsamples. PCB data resulting from the passive air samplers\nand active air sampling on board suggest that R\/V\nPolarstern is a clean ship for these compounds [Gioia\net al., 2007]. Recoveries were routinely monitored using\nthe 13C12 PCBs as surrogate standards and they ranged\nfrom 85 to 107%. Reported values are not recovery\ncorrected. Extraction and cleanup method efficiencies\nwere monitored by spiking cleaned GFFs and PUFs with\nvalidation standards for PCBs and extracting and analyz-\ning those PUFs in the same way as samples. Recoveries\nranged from 90 to 110% for all compounds.\n[12] Two break-through tests were performed for seawa-\nter by filtering water through two XAD columns in series.\nSample volumes were 990 and 1260 L. Concentrations on\nthe back-up column of the lighter compounds were around\n10\u201320% of the first column, suggesting that break-through\nwas not a major concern for our samples. Apparent break-\nthrough values of heavier weight compounds seemed higher\nbut were close to blank concentrations, confirming that\nbreak-through was not of concern. Fortified XAD and\nGFF blanks at 1 and 10 ng total were coanalyzed with the\nsamples, with recoveries around 100% for all congeners.\nAverage concentrations in the XAD blanks were around\n10\u201320 pg per PCB congener. Detection limits were calcu-\nlated as the mean blank concentrations plus three standard\ndeviations. Mean blank concentrations were subtracted from\nthe samples.\n2.5. Meteorological Data and Back Trajectories\n[13] Meteorological data were obtained from PODAS\n(Polarstern Data System) on board the vessel, an online\nmanagement system that collects nautical and meteorolog-\nical parameters from a multitude of measuring devices\ninstalled on the ship. NOAA\u2019s HYSPLIT model and the\nNCEP\/NCAR Global Reanalysis data set were used to\ncalculate back trajectories (BTs) and atmospheric mixing\nheight. BTs were traced for 7 d with 1 h steps at 0000\ncoordinated universal time (UTC) at 500 m above sea level.\nFigure 1 shows the mean sampling location of the transect\nand prevalent air masses direction.\n3. Global Orientation and Sampling Locations\n[14] The sampling locations in the Norwegian Sea, the\nGreenland Sea, and the Arctic Ocean represent different\nregions of the generalized global mass flow in the lower\natmosphere and the ocean water. Figure 1 shows represen-\ntative air mass direction, prevalent surface ocean currents,\nand sea ice coverage during the sampling period. BTanalysis\nshows that about 60% of the samples are oceanic (12\u201319,\n24\u201329, 31, and 33), while for the others air masses were\npartly continental (Canada and Greenland or Russia) and\npartly oceanic (defined as air that has been away from land\nfor 3 days) (3\u201311, 20\u201323, 30, 32, 34, and 35). Only two\nsamples (1\u20132) in the North Sea had air masses coming\npredominantly over the land (Scandinavian countries) before\nsampling.\n[15] In parts of the Norwegian and Greenland Seas, cold\nand saline surface water descends 2\u20133 km down, forming\ncold, oxygen-rich deep waters. The North Atlantic Deep\nWater (NADW) is largely formed in the Labrador Sea and\nthe Greenland Sea by the sinking of highly saline, dense\noverflow water from the Greenland Sea. The region remains\nice-free due to the warm and saline Norwegian Atlantic\nCurrent. Lohmann et al. [2006] estimated a subduction flux\nof \u0002420 kg PCBs a\u00011 for the Norwegian Sea. All the\nsamples collected in the Arctic Ocean and some in the\nGreenland Sea (near the coast of Greenland) were charac-\nterized by ice cover. There would have been minimal\ninteraction between the atmosphere and the water column\nbecause of the ice sheet in between. Weather conditions\nover the ice were predominantly characterized by low wind\nand fog.\n4. Results\n4.1. Air Concentrations\n[16] A total of 37 samples were collected during the\ncruise; \u000250% in the Arctic Ocean, \u000229% in the Greenland\nSea, and \u000221% in part of the North and the Norwegian Sea.\nTable 1 gives a summary of the results for PCB air\nconcentrations in each of the three regions. Atmospheric\nD19302 GIOIA ET AL.: PCBS IN THE EUROPEAN ARCTIC\n4 of 11\nD19302\nconcentrations of the S29PCBs ranged from 3.3 to 250 pg\nm\u00013 over the whole cruise with ca. 70% accounted for by\nCl3Bs and Cl4Bs in all three regions. The SICESPCBs (28,\n52, 90\/101, 118, 138, 153, and 180 identified by the\nInternational Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES)\nas markers of the degree of contamination) ranged from\n0.76 to 100 pg m\u00013 and contributed to \u000230\u201335% to\nS29PCBs. Highest concentrations were determined for\nPCB 28, ranging from \u00021.3 to 50 pg m\u00013; PCB 52 was\npresent at concentrations ranging between 0.42 and 20 pg\nm\u00013. PCB 101 was only detected in 14 samples and ranged\nfrom 0.55 to 12 pg m\u00013. PCBs 118, 138, and 153 were below\n3 pg m\u00013 in the North and the Norwegian Sea and below\n1 pg m\u00013 in the Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean. PCB\n180 was detected in \u000280% of the samples and concen-\ntrations averaged \u00020.8 pg m\u00013 in the Norwegian Sea, and\n\u00020.3 pg m\u00013 in the Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean.\n[17] Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of the\nSICESPCBs and air mass origin for each sample in the\nsampling region. Samples collected near the west coast of\nNorway and Svalbard had the highest concentrations, while\nsamples collected in the middle of the Greenland Sea and\nthe Arctic Ocean had the lowest, with the exception of\n3 samples (17, 26, and 35). Sample 35 was collected at the\nnorthernmost location; its air mass trajectories originated\npartly over Russia. Samples 17 and 26 are oceanic samples;\nit is not clear why they had somewhat (2\u20133 times) higher\nconcentrations than others taken nearby.\n[18] There is clearly a decline in PCB concentration with\nincreasing latitude (from the North and Norwegian Sea to\nthe Arctic Ocean (Table 1 and Figure 2) and a decline in\nconcentration with longitude (i.e., the concentrations de-\ncline from east to west across the transect). The eastern\nsamples were influenced by movement from European\nsource regions over previous days, receiving inputs from\nthe continental air masses (air masses originated and trav-\neled predominantly over land). Samples collected at the\nwestern part of the cruise transect represent clean oceanic\nair masses (air masses originated and traveled over the\nocean) from the south or partly oceanic and partly conti-\nnental from Greenland and Canada. This implies that during\nthis campaign Europe was the major source of PCBs to the\nEuropean Arctic region, but to the rest of the sampling\ncampaign.\n4.2.

[PCB]diss decreased with\nincreasing degree of chlorination. Highest concentrations\nwere determined for PCB 28\/31, ranging from \u00020.2 to\n0.4 pg L\u00011; PCB 52 displayed concentrations from 0.1 to\nTable 1.

Highest particulate-associated con-\ncentrations of PCB 138 were obtained near Europe (0.2 pg\nL\u00011), with the remaining samples being lower in concentra-\ntion (<0.1 pg L\u00011). For PCB 153, \u000250% of samples were\nbelow d.l.

Comparison With Land-Based Measurements and\nOther Data Sets From the Arctic\n[23] This study provides one of the first comprehensive\ndata sets of PCBs in the European Arctic atmosphere over\nthe open ocean. These compounds have been routinely\nmeasured at land-based sites in the Canadian Arctic since\n1993, for the Northern Contaminants Program and in the\nEuropean Arctic since 1991, under AMAP [Hung et al.,\n2005] at Zeppelin mountain, Ny A\u02dalesund, Svalbard\n(78\u0001540N, 11\u0001530E, 474 m above sea level). SICESPCBs\nranged from 2.8 to 20 pg m\u00013 in samples collected at\nZeppelin (cordially provided by the Norwegian Institute for\nAir Research, the Zeppelin monitoring program is funded\nby the Norwegian state pollution control authorities) during\nthe cruise, in line with measurements made here over the\nGreenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean. BT analysis at the\nZeppelin site showed that PCB concentrations are higher\nwhen air masses have traveled over European countries and\nlower when air masses have originated and traveled over\nocean water and Canada.\n[24] Similar PCB concentrations have also been measured\nat Amderma, Russia in 1999\u20132000 and Kinngait II in\nCanada in 2000\u20132001, where the sum of 10 PCB congeners\n(28, 31, 52, 101, 105, 118, 138, 153, 156, and 180 called the\nAMAP subset) was 4.0 and 3.3 pg m\u00013, respectively [Hung\net al., 2005]. Data from 1999 at Alert, Canada and from\n1994 at Dunai in Russia averaged 5.6 pg m\u00013 and 5.9 pg\nm\u00013, respectively, in the same range as those reported in this\nstudy and those at Zeppelin station. However, annual means\nof PCBs (10 AMAP congeners) from 1995 and 1996 at\nSpitsbergen, Norway and Storhofdi, Iceland were 19 and\n17 pg m\u00013, respectively, 3\u20134 times higher than those\nreported in this study. These comparisons generally suggest\nno clear temporal trend of PCBs in the Arctic atmosphere.\nThis was also suggested by Berg et al. [2004], who did not\nfind any evidence to support declining PCB concentrations\nin the Arctic region.\n[25] PCBs in seawater have been measured on several\nstudies into the Northern Atlantic and Arctic Ocean [Schulz-\nBull et al., 1988; Sobek and Gustafsson, 2004]. Schulz-Bull\net al. [1988] determined PCBs at different depths in the\nNorth Atlantic in 1993. Their concentrations reflect the\nexport flux of PCBs to 200 or 300 m depth, and are not\ncomparable to the surface water concentrations determined in\nthis study. In contrast, the studies by Sobek and Gustafsson\n[2004] and from ARKVI measured surface water concen-\ntrations in the northern oceans in 2001 and 1999, respec-\ntively. However, no clear time trend is apparent. For the\nsamples close to Europe, dissolved PCB concentrations\nfrom this study were lower than those determined by\nSobek and Gustafsson [2004] by about a factor of 2.\nHowever, similar concentrations were obtained in the\nsamples north of 80\u0001N. PCB concentrations on a previous\nR\/V Polarstern cruise (ARKXVI) were either higher or\ncomparable to concentrations reported here (Table S1). In\nview of the different analytical procedures used by the\ngroups, and the difficulty of comparing results from\ndifferent years and somewhat different locations, the\nagreement between these three measurements is encourag-\ning. However, it does restrict speculation on any trends or\ntheir absence.\n5.2. Observations of Latitudinal Fractionation\n[26] Changes in the relative abundance of PCB congeners\nin air were observed from Europe toward the Arctic. This\nfractionation is shown in Figure 3, where the relative abun-\ndance of each ICES congener over the total is plotted versus\nlatitude and temperature. The relative abundance of PCB 28\nand PCB 52 increases with increasing latitude (R2 = 0.23, p =\n0.007 and R2 = 0.15, p < 0.01, respectively) and increases\nwith decreasing temperature (R2 = 0.24, p < 0.005 and R2 =\n0.11, p < 0.01). The heavier PCB congeners show the\nopposite trends with a decrease in their relative abundance\nwith increasing latitude and with decreasing temperature.\n[27] Distance from source regions and air\/surface temper-\natures are confounding variables, which influence the mix-\nture in air. However, such fractionation is consistent with\ndiffusive primary sources controlling current ambient levels\nand LRAT being responsible for the delivery of PCBs to the\nArctic region [Meijer et al., 2003; Jaward et al., 2004;\nGioia et al., 2006]; it is in line with congener-specific\ndifferences in atmospheric characteristic travel distances.\nIf a mixture of congeners is assumed to be emitted together\nfrom a primary source region, the heaviest ones are pre-\ndicted to be preferentially deposited close to the source area\n[Wania and Mackay, 1996]. Even though Figure 3 displays\na slight PCB fractionation in air, only 15\u201320% of the\nvariability of atmospheric PCBs can be explained by\ntemperature and therefore by temperature-driven fraction-\nation. Still, other fractionation processes may be occurring\nduring transport.\n[28] Clear changes in the relative abundance of the PCBs\nin seawater were seen (Figure S2). The contribution of PCB\n28 stayed relatively constant from near Europe to the high\nArctic, at \u000240\u201350% of S6PCBs. In contrast, the contribu-\nD19302 GIOIA ET AL.: PCBS IN THE EUROPEAN ARCTIC\n6 of 11\nD19302\ntion of PCB 52 increased from 60\u0001 to 84\u0001N, from \u000230% to\nalmost 50%, while the contribution of PCBs 101, 118, and\n138 decreased strongly. These results suggest evidence of\nthe fractionation hypothesis, which predict increasing con-\ncentrations with latitude for the lower chlorinated conge-\nners, and decreasing trends for PCBs containing four or\nmore chlorines. The first two samples, taken close to\nEurope, were not consistent with the others, presumably\nbecause they were directly influenced by ongoing primary\nemissions from Europe.\n[29] Sobek and Gustafsson [2004] reported a correlation\nof the relative increase of PCBs from near Europe to the\nhigh Arctic with compound subcooled liquid vapor pres-\nsure. PCBs with higher vapor pressures were relatively\nmore abundant in the northernmost samples relative to less\nvolatile congeners. A similar correlation was observed in\nthis data set.\n[30] Therefore, it seems clear that there is a fractionation\nof PCBs in seawater, but a decrease of highly chlorinated\nPCBs with increasing latitude could not only be due to a\ntemperature driven process but also due to fractionation of\nwater column PCBs due to selective transport to deeper\nwaters of the more hydrophobic congeners associated to\nparticulate matter.\n5.3. Ice Cover as a Possible Influence\n[31] Air samples taken from \u2018\u2018ice free\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018ice covered\u2019\u2019\nareas of the Arctic part of the cruise were compared and\nplotted against temperature. No difference between the\nsample subsets or in their correlations with temperature\nwas found. This further suggests that the effect of temper-\nature on the air concentration variability is subtle. A lack of\ndifference between the sample subsets does not mean that\nsnow\/ice or the melting pack ice do not influence Arctic\nFigure 3. Percentage contribution of different International Council for the Exploration of the Seas PCB\ncongeners in air samples versus latitude and temperature.\nD19302 GIOIA ET AL.: PCBS IN THE EUROPEAN ARCTIC\n7 of 11\nD19302\nair PCB concentrations. However, the effects were not\nmeasurable from this ice pack, or were not sufficiently\nstrong\/localized to exert a measurable effect on the air.\nPCBs in the Arctic atmosphere could potentially be influ-\nenced by volatilization of previously deposited compounds\nfrom ice\/snow, or through an influence of meltwaters.\nIndeed, snow\/ice have been shown to have a dynamic effect\non PCBs deposited to them [Herbert et al., 2005; Burniston\net al., 2007]. As the ice breaks up during the summer, direct\nexchange between air and the previously obscured surface\nseawater also recommences [Daly and Wania, 2004].\n5.4. Water Column Biological Activity as a Possible\nInfluence and Comments on Air-Water Equilibrium\nStatus\n[32] Processes in the water column, notably dissolved-\nparticle phase partitioning, biological productivity, reactiv-\nity, and salting out can influence air-water exchange and\nhence air concentrations [Dachs et al., 1999, 2002; Scher-\ninger et al., 2004].\n[33] Knowledge of whether surface ocean waters are in\nequilibrium with the atmosphere, or the net direction of flux\n(i.e., whether absorption or volatilization dominates), is\ncrucial for our understanding of the global cycling and fate\nof POPs [Dachs et al., 2002]. Previous work suggests that\nenhanced sinking fluxes of PCBs occur in high productivity\nareas of high latitudes regions [Dachs et al., 2002], leading\nto efficient removal of PCBs from the surface waters.\nChlorophyll a data from 3-year climatological means\n(obtained from SeaWifs) and fluorescence data from the\nFerry Box on the ship indicate an increase in primary\nproductivity in the water column near the ice marginal zone\n(75\u0001N to 79\u0001N). For example, ice melting can induce\nblooms, which deplete dissolved phase PCBs, especially\nthe more hydrophobic ones. If sinking fluxes are faster than\nair-water exchange fluxes, then the system will not be at\nequilibrium. The flux of gaseous contaminants between the\natmosphere and the oceans is driven by concentration\ngradients and the transport by molecular and turbulent\nmotion. However, this is a highly complex and difficult\nissue to address. There are large uncertainties in making\nsuch estimations [Axelman et al., 2001; Wania et al., 2001;\nBruhn et al., 2003]. Determination of the key physico-\nchemical parameters, notably the HLC required to make\nsuch an assessment, are subject to measurement difficulties\nand artifacts. Different methodologies have been used,\nwhich can be a source of variability in the reported data\n[Bamford et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003; Goss et al., 2004;\nBaker et al., 2004; ten Hulsher et al., 2006].\n5.4.1. Fugacity Quotient\n[34] Fugacity quotients were calculated for paired meas-\nurements of air and water to evaluate the net direction of the\nair\/sea gas exchange for ice free regions and for compara-\ntive purposes in ice covered regions. The fugacity in air\n(fAIR) was calculated according to\nfAIR \u00bc CAIRRTAIR\nM\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere CAIR is the gas phase concentration (g m\n\u00013), R is the\ngas constant (8.314 m3 Pa mol\u00011 K\u00011), TA is the average air\ntemperature (K) and M is the molecular mass (g mol\u00011).\nThe fugacity in the water (fw) was calculated as\nfW \u00bc CWHLC\nM\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere CW is the concentration of the compound in the\ndissolved phase (g m\u00013), and HLC is in Pa m3 mol\u00011.\nOwing to the large uncertainties in reported HLCs for\nPCBs, the fugacity in the water was estimated, using data\nfrom three different sources, namely Li et al. [2003],\nBamford et al. [2002], and ten Hulsher et al. [2006]. The\nHLC values were corrected for temperature and salinity,\nwhile the dissolved phase concentration was DOC corrected\nas reported elsewhere [Totten et al., 2001]. Fugacity\nquotients are shown in Figure 4 (fAIR\/fW) for four PCB\ncongeners (28, 52, 118, and 138). PCB 101 is not shown\nbecause it was often not detected in air, while PCB 153 and\n180 are not shown because they were not detected in the\nseawater. A quotient higher than 1 indicates a net downward\nflux (deposition, fAIR > fW), and a quotient lower than 1\nindicates net upward flux (volatilization, fW > fAIR). An\nestimate of the errors around the fugacity quotient due to\nsampling and analytical error (\u00b11 standard deviation) of air\nand water, \u00b110%, and the uncertainty associated with the\nHLC values, \u00b120%, is also shown in Figure 4. The\npropagated error for the calculation of the fugacity quotient\nis therefore believed to be \u000240%.\n[35] The fugacity quotients of PCBs ranged from 5 to\n440, using the different published values for the different\ncongeners [Bamford et al., 2002; Li et al., 2003; ten Hulsher\net al., 2006] with the highest positive ratio from 75\u0001N to\n79\u0001N. Variability in the quotients was rather high (see\nFigure 4), caused mostly by variability in air concentrations,\nas water concentrations were more homogeneous.\n[36] Given the range of values and the associated uncer-\ntainties, the general picture that emerges is of net deposition\nparticularly in the middle of the transect near the marginal\nice zone (78\u0001\u201379\u0001N) for all the PCB congeners, where both\nice and no ice cover are present. The increase in fugacity\nratio and therefore the net deposition is mainly caused by\nrelatively high air concentration in this region, which\nsuggests very dynamic processes. Possible explanations\nfor this could be as follows:\n[37] 1. As noted earlier, ice aging and melting can be a\nsource of PCBs to the atmosphere. Daly and Wania [2004]\nsuggested that snow cover functions as a temporary storage\nreservoir that releases contaminants accumulated over the\nwinter during a short melt period, resulting in temporarily\nelevated concentrations in air, water, and soil. The intensity\nof these peaks increases with the length of the snow\naccumulation period. Organic chemicals of sufficient vola-\ntility (log KOA < 9; e.g., light PCBs) can volatilize from the\nsnowpack, resulting in summer time concentration maxima\nin the atmosphere. Figure S3 shows the fugacity ratios for\neach different PCB congeners correlated with salinity and\ntemperature gradients. When both salinity and temperature\ndecrease, higher fugacity ratios were observed, suggesting\nthat ice melting may have induced higher atmospheric PCB\nlevels. However, it should be noted that melting ice also can\nrelease nutrients and PCBs to the water column. Higher\nbiological productivity in such regions would presumably\nD19302 GIOIA ET AL.: PCBS IN THE EUROPEAN ARCTIC\n8 of 11\nD19302\nF\nig\nu\nre\n4\n.\nF\nu\ng\nac\nit\ny\nfr\nac\nti\no\nn\ns\no\nf\nfo\nu\nr\nP\nC\nB\nco\nn\ng\nen\ner\ns\n(2\n8\n,\n5\n2\n,\n1\n1\n8\n,\nan\nd\n1\n3\n8\n0\nv\ner\nsu\ns\nla\nti\ntu\nd\ne.\nH\nen\nry\n\u2019s\nL\naw\nco\nn\nst\nan\nts\nw\ner\ne\nta\nk\nen\nfr\no\nm\nB\na\nm\nfo\nrd\net\na\nl.\n[2\n0\n0\n2\n],\nL\ni\net\na\nl.\n[2\n0\n0\n3\n],\nan\nd\nte\nn\nH\nu\nls\nh\ner\net\na\nl.\n[2\n0\n0\n6\n].\nD19302 GIOIA ET AL.: PCBS IN THE EUROPEAN ARCTIC\n9 of 11\nD19302\ndeplete the dissolved phase PCB concentrations and impact\nsinking fluxes and the relative rates of air-water exchange.\n[38] 2. Most of the northernmost samples were taken\nunder foggy conditions, and lower wind speeds. These\nfactors may also have enhanced PCB air concentrations.\nEarly work by Capel et al. [1990] showed enrichment of\nPOPs on fog droplets. However, again there was no sys-\ntematic evidence for an effect of fog when the data set is\nconsidered as a whole.\n5.4.2. Air-Water Fluxes\n[39] Gas exchange rates were calculated (as described in\nthe Auxiliary Material) for the ice free only sites. A negative\nflux indicates that absorption dominates, while a positive\nflux indicates that volatilization dominates. The absorptive\nfluxes were typically more than 90% of the volatilization\nfluxes. Generally, the tri- and tetra-chlorinated PCBs dom-\ninated the flux profiles, accounting for more than 70% of\nthe total estimated PCB fluxes. Total fluxes (defined as the\nsum of those for PCBs 28, 52, 118, and 138) depended on\nthe HLC values selected. They ranged between \u00014 and\n0.08 ng m\u00012 d \u00011 [Li et al., 2003],\u00015.6 and 0.05 ng m\u00012 d\u00011\n[Bamford et al., 2002], and \u00016.3 and 0.1 ng m\u00012 d\u00011 [ten\nHulsher et al., 2006]. There are very few studies reporting\nair-water exchange fluxes over the ocean. Iwata et al. [1993]\nreported aS36PCBs adsorptive net flux of\u0002\u000160 ng m\u00012 d\u00011\nin the North Atlantic, \u0002\u0001100 ng m\u00012 d\u00011 in the Bering Sea,\nand 80 ng m\u00012 d\u00011 (around 2\u20133 times higher than those\nderived here), based on measurements made in the late\n1980s\/early 1990s.\n6. Conclusions\n[40] Concentrations of gaseous PCBs showed no temper-\nature dependency, indicating that PCBs in air and water\nwere neither at nor \u2018\u2018near\u2019\u2019 equilibrium conditions across the\nregion. Furthermore, the calculated fugacity ratios (fA\/fW)\nindicate that net deposition was dominating in all the Arctic\nregion. A higher net deposition of PCBs was observed near\nthe marginal ice zone, where PCB air concentrations tended\nto be higher. However, uncertainties remain over whether\nthis was because melting ice margins were a source of PCBs\nto the atmosphere or whether more complex ice-water-\natmosphere interactions were occurring (e.g., coupled to\nphytoplankton activity). Current knowledge of contaminant\nlevels in sea ice and the interactions between the ice water\nand the atmosphere is still sparse and raises major uncer-\ntainties over seasonal and longer-term PCBs dynamics in\nthe Arctic.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
