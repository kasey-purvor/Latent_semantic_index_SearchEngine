In this letter, some fuzzy \nrules on selecting and integrating different multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters \ntogether are proposed. These fuzzy rules are setup based on the training results of the \ndenoising performances of applying different multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters at \ndifferent noise levels. When a new electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is applied, the \nappropriate multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters are selected and integrated based on \nfuzzy rules and the noise level of the signal. A hard thresholding is applied on the \nmultiwavelet coefficients. According to an extensive simulation, we found that our \nproposed fuzzy rule-based multiwavelet denoising algorithm achieves 30% \nimprovement compared to the traditional multiwavelet denoising algorithms. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThe multiwavelet theory has already proved its efficiency for the signal \ndenoising problem. However, what multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters should be used? \nDo the selections depend on the noise levels? The aim of this letter is to propose a \nmethod to select and integrate different multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters together to \n 2 \nobtain sub-optimal results for the ECG denoising problem. \n \nII. Proposed multiwavelet fuzzy denoising algorithm \nThe block diagram of our proposed multiwavelet fuzzy denoising system \ncomprises with six blocks as in Figure 1. Since two types of Chui Lian (CL) \nmultiwavelets [1, p.289, p.295] and Qingtnag Jiang (QJ) multiwavelet [2] are the most \nwidely used in the signal processing area, we choose these three multiwavelets. \nBesides, thirty-five commonly used pre- and post-filters, including symlets, coiflets, \nDaubenchies and biorthogonal filters, are also used, as listed in Table 1. \nThe fuzzy rules are established based on the following methods: A set of \ninput-output relations that describes the denoising performances of applying different \nmultiwavelets, pre- and post-filters at different noise levels are obtained based on \ntraining samples in the database [3], where the denoising performances are calculated \nbased on the mean square error (MSE) criterion. A TS fuzzy model is established \nbased on trapezoidal fuzzy membership functions described in Figures 2 and 3. The \nfuzzy rules are summarized in Table 2. \nA hard thresholding based on the Donoho approach is applied on the \nmultiwavelet coefficients [4]. \n \nIII. Experimental results \nThe ECG signals used in the experiment are from the Beth Israel Deaconess \nMedical Center at Boston [3]. In order to demonstrate the sub-optimality of different \nmultiwavelets, pre- and post-filters, computer simulations were performed to recover \nsignals of 1000 points embedded in the zero mean AWGN at various noise levels. \n 3 \nFigure 4 shows the average of the MSE of signals in [3] for the fuzzy and \nnon-fuzzy methods. The non-fuzzy method is described as univariate soft \nthresholding in GHM multiwavelet domain [5]. Compared the result of two methods, \nthe fuzzy systems do provide better denoising performances as expected with \nconsistently about 30% MSE improvement. \n \nIV. Conclusions \nThis letter proposes an intelligent based method for selecting and integrating \ndifferent multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters together at different noise levels for the \nECG signal denoising problem. According to our extensive simulations, we found that \nour proposed fuzzy system gives an excellent performance. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this letter was supported partially by a studentship and \npartially by a research grant (G-YD26) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Charles K.
