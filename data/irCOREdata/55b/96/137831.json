In the past, restoration to agriculture was a priority but other options are \nnow being considered (Dobson and Moffat, 1993a; McRae, 1998). With about 28,000 ha of \nlandfill sites in England and Wales (Environment Agency, 2004), planting energy crops on \nrestored sites offers the waste disposal industry a potentially valuable, environmentally \nbeneficial and sustainable use of restored sites (Nixon et al. 2001). The biomass could be used \nfor electricity generation, the production of charcoal or simply as a carbon sink. Currently in \nthe UK, the most widely planted energy crop is willow (Salix spp), grown as short rotation \ncoppice (SRC). By adding large amounts of organic matter to the soil as root and leaf material \n(McElroy and Dawson, 1986; Zan et al. 2001), SRC could also be important in upgrading \npoor restoration cap soils and there are several references to the planting of SRC on such sites \n(Ettala, 1988; Moffat and Houston, 1991; Alker et al., 2002). \n Landfill sites are often established on impermeable clay soils because these prevent the \nseepage of landfill leachate. In the UK, several large sites, receiving municipal household \nwaste from London, have been sited on Oxford clay (Batchelder et al., 1998). Although the \n                                                 \n1 Corresponding author.

The most important of these is the \nuse of Oxford clay for constructing the restoration cap into which the SRC would have to be \nplanted. Like other clay soil forming materials, Oxford clay is low in nutrients and organic \nmatter and because of its texture it drains poorly and readily becomes waterlogged and \nanaerobic (Bending et al., 1999; Dobson and Moffat, 1993a). These properties are \ncompounded by soil compaction while the restoration cap is being laid which reduces soil \npore space, aeration, water-holding capacity and root penetration. Reserves of soil water will \nbe further restricted on most landfill caps because soil depth is seldom more than 1 m while at \nleast 1.5 m is required for good tree growth (Bending and Moffat, 1997a; Stephens et al. \n2001). This situation will be aggravated at Oxford clay landfill sites which are located in parts \nof the UK with low rainfall. \nThere have been a number of papers presenting qualitative descriptions of the effects of \npoor soil conditions on the establishment and growth of SRC on landfill sites. However, \nNixon et al. (2001) highlighted the lack of quantification of the effects of water availability \nand poor soil conditions typical of those on restored landfills on biomass production and its \nallocation within willow SRC. The objectives of the research described in this and a following \npaper were therefore to quantify the effects of nutrients, soil bulk density and water \navailability on the potential biomass production and assimilate partitioning of willow grown \nas SRC on Oxford clay.  \n2 Methods \n2.1 Site and lysimeters \nAll the research was undertaken at Cranfield University Silsoe, Bedfordshire, UK (52 \u00b0N, \n0.3 \u00b0W, at 60 m altitude). Cylindrical polyethylene lysimeters, 0.54 m in diameter and 0.9 m \ndeep, were each fitted with a drainage tap at the base and then filled with 0.1 m of gravel and \na 0.7 m depth of soil. After filling, lysimeters were placed on wooden palettes and arranged \non a 2 m square spacing. In 2001, the spacing between lysimeters was increased to 4 m to \nprevent plants shading each other. The experiment was surrounded by a single guard row of \nlysimeters. Individual willow cuttings (S. viminalis 'Jorr') were planted in each lysimeter on \n21 April 1999 and all plants were coppiced in November 1999. \n2.2 Treatments \nFour soil treatments (Table 1) were investigated and differed according to type of soil, bulk \ndensity in the top 0.4 m and amendment used. Treatments were selected to simulate i) typical \ncompacted cap soil (S1); ii) cap soil cultivated to reduce its bulk density (S2) and iii) \ncultivated cap soil improved by the addition of organic matter and fertiliser (S3). For \ncomparison with better growing conditions, a sandy loam agricultural soil (S4) was included \nusing the same amendments and a similar bulk density to S3. Oxford clay was obtained from \nBrogborough landfill site and the sandy loam soil came from Silsoe campus farm (Cottenham \nseries). Different bulk densities were obtained by packing appropriate weights of soil of \nknown bulk density into successive 0.1 m horizons. In treatments S3 and S4, Biogran (Swiss \nCombi Technology), a soil conditioner manufactured from thermally dried sewage sludge, \nwas used as a source of organic matter. This product contains about 50% organic matter, 3.3% \ntotal nitrogen, 4.4% total phosphorous (as P2O5) and 0.2% potassium (as K2O). It was mixed \ninto the top 0.1 to 0.4 m of soil in the lysimeters at a rate equivalent to 200 t ha-1. Although \nthis is a higher rate than the 50-100 t\/ha currently used at reclamation sites, the rate was \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 2\nselected because Forest Research trials on reclaimed colliery waste in South Wales had shown \nimproved growth by broad-leaved trees with rates of Biogran up to 200 t\/ha (Bending and \nMoffat, 1997b). In 1999 and 2000, nitrogen was applied to treatments S3 and S4 at a rate of \n200 kg N ha-1. In 2001, 300 kg N ha-1, 150 kg P ha-1 and 90 kg K ha-1 were applied to \ntreatments S2, S3 and S4. Rates were increased in 2001 because leaf analyses in August 2000 \nshowed that foliar levels of N and P in the amended treatments were low. The application to \nthe S2 treatment was made to see whether this would improve its growth relative to S1 \nbecause, by the end of 2000, plant growth measurements showed only a small, non-\nsignificant, difference in growth between plants in the two treatments. \nTable 1. Description of soil treatments used in lysimeters. \nTreatment Type of soil Bulk density from 0-0.4 m (kg m-3) Amendments \nS1 Oxford clay 1480 None \nS2 Oxford clay 1270 None \nS3 Oxford clay 1200 Organic matter and fertiliser \nS4 Sandy loam 1270 Organic matter and fertiliser \n \n  In the lysimeters, soil water at several depths was measured on most days of the growing \nseasons with time domain reflectometry probes (Moisture Point MP-917, Environmental \nSensors Inc.) in 1999 and 2000 and by a Diviner (Sentek Pty Ltd) capacitance probe in 2001. \nThroughout the first year, all plants were watered frequently to ensure good establishment. In \nthe second and third years, one plant per replicate in each soil treatment continued to be \ngrown without water stress while the other was subjected to cycles of stress by allowing the \nsoil water content to drop to wilting point before re-watering to saturation. Wilting point was \ndetermined visually as the point when the majority of leaves on a plant started to droop. The \nfirst visual indication of wilting was usually drooping of the growing points of leading shoots. \nSoil probes indicated that wilting occurred at a volumetric soil water content (\u03b8v), at 0.1 m \ndepth, of about 30% in the clay treatments and 22% in the sandy loam. In 2000, plants were \nwatered on the day that wilting occurred while in 2001, watering was on the third day of \nwilting. A more protracted period of stress was used in 2001 because estimates of stem dry \nmatter at the end of 2000 indicated that the water stress treatment was having only a small \neffect on biomass accumulation. In the unstressed treatment, a soil water content \ncorresponding to a soil water potential of -0.05 MPa in the top 0.10 - 0.15 m was used as the \nthreshold for watering. These were identified from soil water release curves as corresponding \nto a \u03b8v of 47% for the clay and 27% for the sandy loam. Rainwater could not be prevented \nfrom entering the lysimeters and so the imposition of drought treatments was dependent on \nthe occurrence of dry periods of weather. In figures and tables the two watering treatments are \nreferred to as NS (no stress) and S (stress). \n The experiment used a randomised complete block design with three replicates. In each \nreplicate, one of the 8 treatments (4 soils x 2 watering regimes) was allocated to each \nlysimeter but since no water stress treatment was applied in the first year, each soil treatment \nwas represented by two lysimeters per replicate in this year. In the second and third years, \neach replicate contained a single lysimeter with each treatment. The water stress treatment \nwas applied to the same lysimeters in 2001 as in 2000. \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 3\n2.3 Measurements \nDuring the growing seasons, the basal diameters of all stems were measured monthly with \ndigital calipers (Camlab, Cambridge) and converted to stem basal area (SBA), assuming the \nstem cross-section was circular. Plant SBA was calculated as the sum of the SBA of all the \nstems on a plant. Stem dry mass was determined from allometric relationships between this \nand SBA using 80 stems in 1999 after coppicing and 240 (10 per plant) in 2001. Stems were \nselected across the range of stem diameters and oven-dried at 105oC until constant mass. The \nrelationships fitted were logarithmic forms of the power curve, Y = a(SBA)b:  \nLnY = Lna + bLn(SBA) (1) \nwhere Y is dry mass (g)  and SBA is in cm2. These relationships were then used to \nretrospectively estimate stem dry mass for all stems on plants.  \n In 1999, the same relationships were used for all treatments and these accounted for 99% \nof the variation in stem dry mass. In 2001, significant differences in the relationships were \nfound between soil and watering treatments. In addition, there were significant differences \nbetween stressed trees in each soil treatment. For these, therefore, different relationships were \nused for each tree. For unstressed trees, the same relationship was used for the three trees in \neach soil treatment. On average, the relationships accounted for 98% of the variation in stem \ndry mass.  \n During the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons, non-destructive monthly measurements of leaf \narea were made to derive relationships between stem basal area and stem leaf area. \nMeasurements were made on six stems of plants in each treatment using stems across the \nrange of stem diameters. Stem leaf area was calculated from the product of number of leaves \nstem-1 and an estimate of the average area of a leaf on each stem which was obtained from \nleaf area measurements made on every tenth leaf of sampled stems. Leaf area was derived \nfrom measurements of leaf length (from the base of the lamina to the tip) and width (at the \nwidest point) using a linear relationship determined in 2000 from a sample of 30 leaves of \ndifferent sizes: \nA = 0.729 (L W)  (2) \nwhere A is area (cm2), L is length (cm) and W is width (cm; s.e. of the regression coefficient, \n0.014; r2 = 0.96). Simple linear regressions were used for the relationships between SBA and \nstem leaf area. Significant differences were found in the relationship between soil and water \nstress treatments and measurement dates so that a different relationship was used for each \ntreatment at each date. Averaged over treatment and measurement date, the relationships \naccounted for 85% and 80% of the variation in stem leaf area in 2000 and 2001, respectively. \nGenerally, the highest correlations occurred from July to September when leaf areas were \nlargest. \n Plant leaf area duration (LAD) was calculated as the sum of each plant\u2019s leaf area on each \nday of the growing season. It was assumed that there was a linear change in leaf area between \nmeasurement dates.  \n At the final harvest in November 2001, all stems were removed from stumps by cutting \nthem at their base. The lysimeters were then cut open and stumps were separated from roots. \nStumps were defined as the above-ground part of the plant remaining after stem removal plus \nthe below-ground part which had grown radially outwards from the original willow cutting. \nRoots were separated from stumps at the point where they emerged from the stump. \nExamination of guard row plants showed a fairly uniform radial distribution of roots and in \nexperimental lysimeters, a sample, consisting of a one-quarter longitudinal section of soil \ncore, was used to measure root biomass. This was randomly selected (but always excluded the \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 4\nportion containing the Diviner access tube) and was divided into four segments, each of 0.2 m \ndepth. These were left to soak in water for 48 h, and coarse roots (>2 mm diameter) were then \nwashed out. Fine roots (<2 mm diameter) were sampled from the remainder of the soil core \nusing soil density rings (20 mm deep by 54 mm in diameter) but particularly high \nconcentrations occurred just below the soil surface and around the outside of the soil core. \nThese were sampled by collecting one sample from the surface, mid-way between the willow \nstump and the edge of the soil core, and peripheral samples from the outer face of the soil core \nat 0.10, 0.30, 0.50 and 0.65 m depths. Fine roots washed from these samples were used to \nestimate the mass of fine roots in the upper and outer 0.02 m of the soil core. An estimate of \nthe mass of fine roots in the remainder of the soil core was obtained by taking single soil \nsamples mid-way between the willow stump and the edge of the soil core at 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, \n0.35, 0.45, 0.55 and 0.65 m depths.  \n Soil density rings could not be used to sample the gravel at the bottom of the lysimeters \n(0.70 - 0.80 m depth) and so gravel was separated from soil in the 0.60 - 0.80 m soil segment \nand both fine and coarse roots were washed out and separated. No distinction was made \nbetween living and dead roots. Roots were oven-dried at 80 \u00b0C until constant mass. Table 2 \nshows how the location and depth of the fine root samples relates to the 0.20 m depth \nintervals used for presenting results. \nTable 2.

Similar composite soil samples were collected from all lysimeters at 0.10 m \ndepth in August 2000 and 0.30 m depth in November 2001. Soil and leaf samples from each \ntreatment were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium using methods described in \nMAFF (1986). Values presented for each element are the means of three determinations on \ndifferent sub-samples from each composite sample. \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 5\n2.4 Pot experiment \nThe effect of macronutrients on biomass production by willow on Oxford clay was \ninvestigated by a pot experiment established in 2001. The 8 fertiliser treatments consisted of a \nfactorial arrangement of two levels (present or absent) of each of nitrogen, phosphorus and \npotassium. Fertilisers were applied as ammonium nitrate, single superphosphate and sulphate \nof potash at rates corresponding to 200kg N ha-1, 100 kg P ha-1 and 60 kg K ha-1, based on pot \nsoil surface area.  These rates were chosen because they were approximately two thirds of \nthose applied to the lysimeters in 2001 and lower rates were considered more appropriate for \nyoung plants. Individual willow cuttings of the S. viminalis clone Q683 were planted on 5th \nApril, in plastic pots 0.25 m in diameter and 0.22 m tall, filled with Oxford clay. Pots were \nplaced on saucers to prevent roots growing into the soil. Fertiliser treatments were applied as \ntop dressings to the pots after watering, one month after the cuttings sprouted. Until plants \nwere harvested in mid-July, pots were watered  daily, unless there was rain. At harvest, all \nshoots were removed from plants and their lengths measured. The shoots from each plant \nwere then divided into three components: main shoot stem, main shoot leaf and other shoots \n(leaves and stems together). The three components were dried and weighed separately (at \n100oC until constant weight) and the proportion of main shoot dry mass in stem and leaf was \nthen used to estimate the mass of these components in the other shoots, thereby allowing an \nestimate to be made of the dry mass partitioned between stem and leaf in each plant.  \nA randomised complete block experimental design was used with each treatment being \napplied to one of the eight pots in each of the four replicates. \n2.5 Data analysis \nData were analysed using Genstat 5 \u2013 Release 4.1 (NAG Ltd, Oxford). Measurements from \nthe lysimeter experiment in 1999 were analysed using a one-way ANOVA in randomised \nblocks while a two-way ANOVA in randomised blocks was used for the 2000 and 2001 \nmeasurements. Where repeated measurements were made through a season or over several \nseasons, separate ANOVAs were performed on the data from each measurement occasion. \nThe pot experiment (section 2.4) was analysed by general analysis of variance. For both \nexperiments, the statistical significance of main effects was determined from F ratios in the \nANOVA table while that between treatment pairs was tested with the Student t-test using the \nappropriate standard error of the difference between means. A 5% significance level was \nadopted for identifying significant treatment effects. \n3 Results \n3.1 Climate \nFigure 1 shows monthly rainfall and monthly average daily solar radiation and temperature at \nthe Silsoe meteorological site over the 3 years of the trial. In the two growing seasons when \nwater stress treatments were imposed, rainfall was only low in June and August 2000 and \nJune 2001. Nevertheless, the irregular distribution of rain within months meant that it was still \npossible to impose 11 cycles of soil drying on the S3 and S4 treatments in 2000 and six in \n2001. Fewer cycles were experienced by plants in the S1 and S2 treatments because their slow \nrate of water use, resulting from their smaller leaf area, meant that drying cycles were more \noften interrupted by rain. \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 6\n020\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nJa\nn-\n99\nA\npr\n-9\n9\nJu\nl-9\n9\nO\nct\n-9\n9\nJa\nn-\n00\nA\npr\n-0\n0\nJu\nl-0\n0\nO\nct\n-0\n0\nJa\nn-\n01\nA\npr\n-0\n1\nJu\nl-0\n1\nO\nct\n-0\n1\nMonth\nR\nai\nnf\nal\nl (\nm\nm\n)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\no C\n); \nSo\nla\nr r\nad\nia\ntio\nn \n(M\nJ \nm\n-2\n d\n-1\n)\nRainfall Average Temperature Solar radiation\n \nFigure 1. Monthly rainfall and monthly average daily temperature and solar radiation at Silsoe, \nBedfordshire from January 1999 to December 2001. \n3.2 Plant growth \nWith the exception of number of stems plant-1 at the end of 1999, there were large treatment \ndifferences at the end of each growing season in number of stems plant-1 and SBA plant-1 \n(Figure 3). Generally, the two variables were significantly and similarly affected by the soil \ntreatments. This resulted in growth being poorest during 1999 and 2000 in the unamended \nclay treatments (S1 and S2) and most vigorous in the sandy loam (S4); growth in the amended \nclay treatment (S3) was significantly better than in the unamended treatments but poorer than \nin the sandy loam. This trend continued in 2001 but the addition of fertiliser to the S2 \ntreatment resulted in improved growth and a significantly higher SBA plant-1 than the S1 \ntreatment. Water stress significantly reduced SBA plant-1 in 2001.  \nPlant leaf area was significantly affected by soil treatments in both 2000 and 2001 but \nby water stress only in 2001 (Figure 2). Thus, in 2000, the maximum in the sandy loam \ntreatment (S4) was more than twice that of the amended clay treatment (S3) which in turn was \nabout five times that of the unamended clay treatments (S1 and S2). In 2001, the leaf area of \nplants in all treatments, except S1, was greater than in 2000 and from June there were \nsignificant main effects of both soil and water stress and a significant interaction between the \ntwo. Throughout the season, soil treatments showed the same ranking for plant leaf area as \noccurred in 2000 except that it was significantly greater in the S2 than in the S1 treatment. \nThe more protracted water stress regime used in 2001 resulted in greater leaf-fall after wilting \nthan in 2000 and hence significant reductions in leaf area in all treatments except S1 - this \nresulted in a significant interaction between stress and soil treatments.  \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 7\nTable 3.

There was also a significant soil x stress \ninteraction from September 2000 resulting from the proportionately smaller effects of stress \non plants in the S1 and S3 treatments compared with those in the S2 and S4 treatments. \nAmongst the non-stress treatments at the end of 2001, stem dry mass was almost ten times \ngreater (2.53 kg plant-1) in the amended (S3) than in the unamended clay (S1; 0.28 kg plant-1) \nbut this was still only 41% of that produced on the sandy loam soil (S4; 6.23 kg plant-1). \nCompared with the non-stress treatments, stress reduced stem dry mass by between 26% and \n36% at the end of the experiment. In the first two years, reducing soil bulk density alone (S2) \nresulted in only a small increase in stem dry mass compared with the high bulk density \ntreatment (S1). In the third year, following the application of fertiliser to the S2 treatment, \nthere were much larger, significant differences between these treatments.  \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nJun-99 Oct-99 Jan-00 Jun-00 Oct-00 Jan-01 Jun-01 Oct-01\nDate\nSt\nem\n d\nry\n m\nas\ns \n(k\ng \npl\nan\nt-\n1 )\nS1, S S1, NS S2, S S2, NS S3, S S3, NS S4, S S4, NS\n \nFigure 3.

There were, however, significant \ndifferences between the relationships for stressed and unstressed plants with the slope of the \nline for stressed plants being less than that for unstressed plants. This can largely be attributed \nto differences in dry matter partitioning.

Abbreviations for soil (S1 to S4) and water stress (NS and S) \ntreatments used in the legend are defined in Table 1 and section 2.2. \n3.3 Root growth \nWhen harvested in November 2001, there were large differences in root biomass between the \ntreatments (Table 4), although these were not always the same as those seen for stem dry \nmass. Thus, total root dry mass was significantly affected by soil type and amendment but not \nby water stress. Stress resulted in a different distribution of roots down the soil profile so that \nunstressed plants had significantly more root in the top 0.2 m while stressed plants had \nsignificantly more from 0.4 - 0.6 m and below 0.6 m. In addition, plants in the clay soil \ntreatments had a higher proportion of their root dry mass in the top 0.2 m than those in the \nsandy loam (71% compared with 43% for unstressed plants and 50% compared with 34% for \nstressed plants) showing that their root systems were generally shallower. In the clay \ntreatments, there was very little development of thick structural roots in the interior of the soil \ncore and most grew outwards to the perimeter of the lysimeter and then down the edge of the \nsoil core. In the sandy loam, structural roots were well distributed throughout the soil core. \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 10\nTable 4.

Total plant dry \nmass was significantly affected by soil, showing the same trends as seen for stem dry mass \u2013 \ni.e. S1<S2<S3<S4. Water stress significantly reduced plant dry mass but there was a \nsignificant soil x stress interaction resulting from the proportionately larger reduction of dry \nmass in stressed plants of the S4 treatment (27%) compared with the other treatments (S3, \n14%; S2, 11%; S1, 7%). Soil and stress had significant effects on the proportion of plant mass \nin root and stem. Thus, plants in the clay (S1, S2 and S3) and water stress treatments had a \nhigher proportion of their dry mass in roots and a smaller proportion in stems compared with \nthose in the sandy loam (S4) and unstressed treatments. Consequently, root: stem ratios were \nhigher in the clay than in the sandy loam and in the stress than unstressed treatments. \nTable 5.

In the amended clay (S3),  levels of N and P were considerably higher than in S1 and \nS2 but not as high as those in the sandy loam. In 2001, in spite of the fertiliser application to \ntreatments S2, S3 and S4, the foliar content of N was near deficiency by August in all \nunstressed treatments but considerably higher in the stressed. P showed a similar trend, except \nthat levels were above the deficiency threshold in the S4 unstressed plants. The soil analyses \nin November 2001 showed that N and P continued to be very much higher in the S4 than S3 \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 12\ntreatment and that, notwithstanding the fertiliser application, they were still very low in the S2 \ntreatment.  \nTable 6.

All of these parameters were affected by significant (P<0.001) \ninteractions between the two fertilisers such that the addition of one without the other resulted \nin only a small improvement in growth while the application of both had a much larger effect. \nNitrogen significantly (P<0.001) affected the proportion of shoot dry mass in leaf which was \n45% for the N treatments and only 31% for those without N. \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 13\n05\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nC N P K NP NK PK NPK\nTreatment\nD\nry\n m\nas\ns \n(g\n p\nla\nnt\n-1\n) Leaf Stem\nSED Stem\nSED Leaf\n \nFigure 6.

This \nis also supported by the considerable improvement in growth of S2 plants in 2001 following \nthe application of N, P and K fertilisers. Soil nutritional deficiencies therefore seem to have \nbeen the principal cause of the poor growth of S1 plants throughout the trial and can be \nexpected to be a major constraint under field conditions. The low levels of N and P found in \nthe leaves of unstressed S2, S3 and S4 plants in August 2001 suggest that readily available \nsupplies of these nutrients had been exhausted by August. This could have resulted from a \ncombination of uptake (during the vigorous growth of June and July) and leaching and \nmineralisation. These factors would all have had a larger effect on unstressed than stressed \nplants, explaining the differences seen between them in foliar N and P levels. Little retention \nof N and P applied as mineral fertiliser to the clay soil is also indicated by the low levels of \nthese minerals found in the soil of the S2 treatment in November 2001. In this treatment, no \nadditional organic matter had been applied and the low organic matter content of the soil may \nhave predisposed it to leaching. The higher soil N and P in the S3 and S4 treatments would \nprobably have resulted from the Biogran which had still not completely broken down.  \n In view of the very high correlation between stem dry matter production and LAD \n(Figure 4), it is likely that the large effect of nutritional amendment on biomass production \ncan be attributed, principally, to an effect on leaf area development. Differences in plant leaf \narea between the treatments (S1<S2<S3<S4) were, in part, the result of differences in leaf \nnumber per plant  - a direct effect of differences in the number of stems and the length of \nstems, both of which showed the same trend as plant leaf area - S1<S2<S3<S4. There were \nalso treatment differences, however, in the average area leaf-1. Differences between treatments \nin leaf number and average area leaf-1 are demonstrated by data from detailed studies during \n2001 on that year\u2019s extension growth on the main shoots of plants. These data will be \npublished elsewhere and showed significant differences between soil treatments in the number \nof leaves shoot-1 (26.8 for S1, 33.3 for S3 and 43.5 for S4) and the average area leaf-1 (5.9 cm2 \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 14\nfor S1, 7.2 cm2 for S2 and 11.4 cm2 for S4). The study also showed that although there were \nfewer leaves shoot-1 and smaller average areas leaf-1 in the stress treatment, only number of \nleaves shoot-1 was significantly reduced by stress. \n Although small improvements in growth occurred as a result of reducing soil bulk density \n(S2 plants showed about a 20% increase in stem dry mass over S1 plants at the end of 2000), \nsubstantial improvements in biomass production were only obtained by the addition of \nfertiliser (S2 in 2001) or fertiliser and organic matter (S3). In addition to organic matter, \nBiogran is a source of nitrogen and phosphorus and this probably accounted for the improved \ngrowth of the S3 treatment in 1999 when no mineral fertiliser was used. Nutrient shortages, \nparticularly of nitrogen, have been reported in other studies of trees planted on restored \nlandfill sites (DETR, 2001) and large yield responses of cereals to mineral fertilisers also \noccurred on a restored London clay site (Sellers et al., 2001). Although the results indicated \nthat nutrition was more important for willow growth than either soil bulk density or organic \nmatter, successful restoration of landfill sites will require attention being given to all three \nfactors. High soil bulk densities can be avoided by appropriate soil placement practices like \nloose tipping (Dobson and Moffat, 1993b) while organic matter is best incorporated in the cap \nwhen it is established. \n While soil amendment greatly improved tree growth on the Oxford clay, stem dry matter \nproduction plant-1 was still only 41% that of plants in the sandy loam soil at the end of 2001. \nIt is possible that their growth was limited by poor soil aeration (Kozlowski, 1986) resulting \nfrom waterlogging. This would have been particularly likely in the unstressed clay treatments \nwhere frequent watering, to avoid water stress, resulted in high soil water contents below 0.3 \nm depth for much of the time. The observation that, in all the clay treatments, the majority of \nthe larger structural roots were confined to the soil surface and soil-lysimeter interface \nsupports this suggestion. Very few of these roots were found in the bulk of the soil below 0.3 \nm depth. Although biomass production plant-1 was not as high in the S3 treatment as in the \nsandy loam, in field plantings it might be possible to increase production ha-1 by using a \nhigher plant density than normal. \n The experiment has highlighted the importance of improving the nutritional status of \nOxford clay but practical methods of achieving this are restricted by the nature of the crop. \nAmendment by incorporating Biogran or some other organic matter into the cap is appropriate \ninitially, but it is likely that additional N and P will be required by about the third year of \ngrowth. There would be considerable advantage for the landfill industry to develop an \nappropriate amendment based on composted municipal green waste. Further incorporation of \norganic fertilisers would not be possible because of the presence of the coppice but top-\ndressings of sewage sludge or compost could be applied after each harvest of stems. Although \nconsiderations of cost and convenience would favour the use of mineral fertilisers, these seem \nto have been quickly lost from Oxford clay, particularly in the absence of an organic matter \namendment. This has also been found in other restoration situations (Bradshaw and \nChadwick, 1980) and, for longer cutting cycles, organic amendments provide a more \nsustained release of nutrients (Adegbidi et al., 2003). Landfill leachate is another potential \nsource of nutrients and its utilisation would be of particular interest to the landfill industry \nbecause of the high costs incurred in treating or storing it. Although some studies have found \nnegative effects on survival (Mensar et al., 1983) and plant growth (Wong and Leung, 1989), \nothers have reported improved growth (Ettala, 1988; Cureton et al., 1991). In parallel studies \nto those in this paper, Brierley et al. (2001) have also found substantial increases in stem \nbiomass production from irrigating willow on Oxford clay with leachate compared with \nwater. In addition to providing nutrients, this would also alleviate water stress resulting from \nthe shallow soil at these sites and their location in low rainfall areas. Although there are \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 15\nconcerns about the long-term sustainability of using leachate because of the build up of salts \nin the soil (Brierley et al., 2001), trials using SRC for leachate management have been run at \nsome landfill sites (Alker et al, 2002) and practical recommendations made for such systems \n(WRc, 2002). On Oxford clay soils, however, the protracted period for which these soils are \nwet, sticky and not trafficable raises additional practical problems affecting the feasibility of \nmechanised SRC activities at the appropriate time (Martin et al., 2002). \nCompared with plants grown on a sandy loam soil, those on Oxford clay allocated a greater \nproportion of their biomass to roots at the expense of stems. This would be a disadvantage if \nthe sole objective was stem biomass production but not if credits were being earned for soil \ncarbon accumulation or if an objective was the long-term improvement in soil structure by the \naccumulation of organic matter. A previous study of lysimeter-grown willow (Rytter, 2001) \nfound root:stem ratios (i.e. stem, excluding leaf and stump) of 0.11-0.15 in the second and \nthird year of growth. In the present study, root:stem ratios determined from the same plant \nparts were very much higher and averaged 1.02 (clay) and 0.60 (sandy loam) in the unstressed \nplants and 1.68 (clay) and 0.80 (sandy loam) in the stressed plants. Bonneau (2005) \ninvestigated the root:stem ratios of 5 hybrid willow clones (\u201cTora\u201d, \u201cAshton Stott\u201d, \n\u201cResolution\u201d, \u201cEndurance\u201d and LA980289) growing in lysimeters at Silsoe under similar \nconditions to those of the S4 treatment. These varied from 0.56 to 1.27 in unstressed plants \nand 0.41 to 0.89 in stressed plants. While the root:stem ratios of the plants in our study fall \nwithin the range of those of Bonneau (2005), the root:stem ratios of his stressed plants were \nconsistently lower than the non-stressed. This may be related to the more severe stress regime \nused in his study. Plant root:stem ratios are affected by a number of factors, including \nnutrition, and shortages of N and P both result in increases in the root:shoot ratio (Ericsson et \nal., 1996). Thus, in the energy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), nitrogen rates of 0, \n112 and 224 kg ha-1 resulted in root:shoot ratios of 6.1, 2.4 and 1.8 respectively (Ma et al., \n2001) while in Norway Spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) the application of three different \nnitrogen levels resulted in root:shoot ratios of about 0.8 (N0), 0.7 (N300) and 0.4 (N600) \n(George and Seith, 1998). Differences in soil nutrient levels in the present study (Table 6) \nmay therefore have contributed to the marked differences in root:stem ratio between the clay \nand sandy loam treatments and may also explain the higher root:stem ratios in unstressed \nplants compared with Rytter\u2019s (2001) fertigated plants which received a daily supply of \nnutrients. Both studies have shown more biomass in fine than coarse root.  \nAs found in many other studies (Ericsson et al., 1996; Kozlowski, 1982), water stress \ncaused a proportionately larger reduction in stem than root dry mass. Differences in dry \nmatter partitioning also contributed to the different relationship between stem dry matter and \nLAD in Figure 4. The reduction in stem dry mass of stressed S4 plants can be divided into \ntwo components which can be attributed to: i) the effects of partitioning and, probably, \nreduced net photosynthesis; and ii) reduced LAD. These components contributed \napproximately 73% and 27% respectively, to the reduction in stem dry mass in this treatment. \nIt is not possible to separate the contribution of partitioning and reduced photosynthesis since \nthe root biomass was only determined at the end of the experiment. The effects of water stress \non water use and the water use efficiency (WUE) of willow SRC are reported in the \nsubsequent paper in this series (Martin and Stephens, 2005). \nIn conclusion, the present research has indicated that nutritional amendment of Oxford clay \nlandfill cap soil will be fundamental to obtaining reasonable biomass production from willow \nSRC on such sites. Even allowing for the heavy fertilisation of the sandy loam treatment in \nthe present experiment, the results suggest that production is unlikely to approach that on \ngood agricultural soils. It may be possible to rectify nutritional deficiencies of Oxford clay by \nusing end-products of the landfill industry like composted municipal green waste or landfill \nMartin and Stephens (I Growth and biomass) 16\nleachate. Irrigation with the latter, as part of a leachate management system, would reduce the \neffects of water stress on biomass production during dry periods and lower the volume of \nleachate needing to be stored or treated. Biomass partitioning in willow was shown to be \naffected by both soil and water stress treatments, emphasising the need for both above- and \nbelow-ground monitoring of biomass production to obtain an accurate estimate of total plant \nproduction. A larger proportion of plant biomass was allocated to roots on Oxford clay than \non a good agricultural soil, suggesting that willow could be used as part of a long-term \nrestoration strategy to increase soil organic matter at these sites.  \nAcknowledgements \nThis project was financed by the shanks first fund.
