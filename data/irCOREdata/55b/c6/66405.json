There are many sources of uncertainty, but they\ncan be divided into two classes: those which are associated with the experimental errors on the\ndata that are fitted in the global analysis and those which are due to what can loosely be called\ntheory errors. In this latter category we have uncertainties due to (i) NNLO and higher-order\nDGLAP contributions, (ii) effects beyond the standard DGLAP expansion, such as extra ln x\nand ln(1\u2212x) terms, higher twist and saturation contributions, (iii) the particular choice of the\nparametric form of the starting distributions, (iv) heavy target corrections, (v) model assump-\ntions, such as s = s\u00af. In order to estimate some of these \u2018theory\u2019 errors, we can also look at the\nuncertainties arising from different choices of the data cuts (Wcut, xcut, Q\n2\ncut), defined such that\ndata with values of W , x or Q2 below the cut are excluded from the global fit. This approach\nindicates where the current theory is struggling to fit the data compared to other regions.\nHere we study the uncertainties due to the errors on the data, and leave the discussion of\nthe \u2018theory\u2019 uncertainties to a second paper. Other groups [1]\u2013[7] have also concentrated on the\nexperimental errors and have obtained estimates of the uncertainties on parton distributions\nwithin a NLO QCD framework, using a variety of competing procedures. Of course, the parton\ndistributions are not, themselves, physical quantities. However, using the standard approach of\nthe linear propagation of errors, these uncertainties of the parton distributions can be translated\ninto uncertainties on observables. Therefore, we first follow the general approach in [4] and [5],\nthe Hessian method, and diagonalize the error matrix, parameterizing an increase in \u03c72 of the\nfit in terms of a quadratic function of the variation of the parameters away from their best\nfit values. This gives us a number of sets of partons with variations from the minimum in\northogonal directions which can be used in a simple manner to calculate the uncertainty on any\nphysical quantity. However, this approach depends for its reliability on the assumption that\nthe quadratic dependence on the variation of the parton parameters is very good. We find that\nthis approximation, with some modifications of the precise framework, i.e. the elimination of\nsome parameters and rescaling of others, can be made to work well. We make available 30 sets\nof partons \u2013 2 for each of the 15 eigenvector directions in parton parameter space \u2013 which can\nbe used to calculate the uncertainties on any physical quantity.\nDespite its convenience, the Hessian approach does suffer from some problems if one looks\nat it in detail, and if one tries to extrapolate results, in particular if we consider large increases\nin \u03c72. It is also not, in principle, the most suitable method when allowing \u03b1S to vary as one\nof the free parameters in the fit. Hence, in this paper we also investigate the uncertainties on\nobservables directly. In order to do this we apply the Lagrange multiplier method [8] to the\nobservables themselves, therefore avoiding some of the approximations involved in the linear\npropagation of errors from partons to the observables, and confirming that these approximations\ndo not usually cause serious problems. When using this Lagrange multiplier approach, the\n1\nresulting sets of parton distributions, which correspond to the extreme values of each observable,\ncan to a certain extent be thought of as the maximum allowed variation of the dominant\ncontributing partons in the relevant kinematic (x,Q2) domain. We select observables which are\nparticularly relevant for experiments at present and future colliders, and which illustrate the\nuncertainties on specific partons in a variety of kinematic (x,Q2) domains. In order to determine\nthe true uncertainty on quantities we also let \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) vary along with the parameters describing\nthe parton distributions directly, which is easy to implement in this approach. Some quantities\nare then far more sensitive to \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) than others. Fortunately our global fit [9] produces a\nvalue of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) which is consistent with the world average, with the same type of error, i.e.,\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119\u00b1 0.002. Hence, it is completely natural to simply let \u03b1S(M2Z) vary as a free\nparameter in the fit in the same way as all the other parameters when determining uncertainties.\nHowever, we also perform an investigation of the uncertainties with \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) fixed at 0.119 in\norder to study more directly which variations in the parton distributions are responsible for\nextreme variations in given physical quantities, and to compare with the results of the Hessian\napproach.\nThe physical observables that we select as examples in this introductory study are, first,\nthe charged-current structure functions FCC2 (e\n\u00b1p) for deep inelastic scattering at high x and\nQ2 at HERA. These observables almost directly represent the d, u valence quarks at high x\nand Q2, where deep inelastic data do exist [10]\u2013[12], but have errors of 25% or more at present.\nThe precision on these data is expected to increase dramatically in the near future. Second,\nwe determine the uncertainties on the cross-sections \u03c3W and \u03c3H , for W boson production and\nfor the production of a Higgs boson of mass2 MH = 115 GeV by gluon fusion respectively, at\nTevatron and LHC energies. The cross section \u03c3W is sensitive to the sea quarks (and also, at\nthe Tevatron energy, weakly sensitive to the valence quarks) in a range of rapidity centered\nabout x \u223c MW\/\n\u221a\ns, and for Q2 \u223c M2W . Similarly, \u03c3H is sensitive to the gluon distribution in\nthe domain x \u223c MH\/\n\u221a\ns and Q2 \u223c M2H .\nAs a third example we determine the uncertainty on the ratio of W\u2212 to W+ production at\nthe LHC energy. This ratio is expected to be extremely accurately measured in the LHC exper-\niments. Other relevant examples, which we study, are the uncertainties of the moments of the\nnon-singlet (u\u2013d) quark distributions. These are quantities for which lattice QCD predictions\nare becoming available, see, for example, Refs. [13, 14].\nThe same techniques can be easily and quickly applied to a wide variety of other physical\nprocesses sensitive to different partons and different domains. Besides giving a direct evaluation\nof the uncertainties on the observables, we can, in principle, unfold this information to map out\nthe uncertainties on NLO partons over the whole kinematic domain where perturbative QCD\nis applicable.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the Hessian method, and\noutline our extraction of different parton distribution sets using this approach. In particular\n2There is nothing special about the choice of 115 GeV. We may choose different values in order to probe the\ngluon in different x,Q2 domains.\n2\nwe highlight the problems encountered, and how they are dealt with in order to obtain reliable\nresults. We make the sets of partons obtained publicly available. In Section 3 we briefly recall\nthe elements of the Lagrange multiplier method. In the following four sections we determine\nthe uncertainties of the observables that we have mentioned above. This will involve a series\nof global fits in which the observables are constrained at different values in the neighbourhood\nof their values obtained in the optimum global fit. In each case we explore, and discuss, the\nallowed variation of the dominantly contributing partons. Using this more rigorous method\nwe also confirm the general appropriateness of the Hessian approach, but discuss where it can\nstart to break down.\nFinally, in Section 8, we summarize and briefly investigate the uncertainties associated with\nthe initial assumptions made in performing the global fit. In order to do this we compare\nthe W and H boson predictions with those obtained using both a slightly updated set of our\nown partons, MRST2002, and using the CTEQ6 partons [5]. (All the results in Sections 2\u20137\nare based on MRST2001 partons [9].) We find that for the comparison with CTEQ some of\nthe variations in predictions are surprisingly large. We also illustrate the same result for the\nextractions of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) by various different groups. This implies that uncertainties involved with\ninitial assumptions and also with theoretical corrections can be more important than those due\nto errors on the data.\n2 The Hessian method\nThe basic procedure involved in this approach is discussed in detail in [4], but we briefly\nintroduce the important points here. In this method one assumes that the deviation in \u03c72\nfor the global fit3 from the minimum value \u03c720 is quadratic in the deviation of the parameters\nspecifying the input parton distributions, ai, from their values at the minimum, a\n0\ni . In this case\nwe can write\n\u2206\u03c72 = \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c720 =\nn\u2211\ni=1\nn\u2211\nj=1\nHij(ai \u2212 a0i )(aj \u2212 a0j ), (1)\nwhere Hij is an element of the Hessian matrix, and n is the number of free input parameters.\nIn this case the standard linear propagation of errors allows one to calculate the error on any\nquantity F using the formula\n(\u2206F )2 = \u2206\u03c72\nn\u2211\ni=1\nn\u2211\nj=1\n\u2202F\n\u2202ai\nCij(a)\n\u2202F\n\u2202ai\n, (2)\nwhere Cij(a) = (H\n\u22121)ij is the covariance, or error matrix of the parameters, and \u2206\u03c7\n2 is the\nallowed variation in \u03c72. Hence, in principle, once one has either the Hessian or covariance\nmatrix (and a suitable choice of \u2206\u03c72) one can calculate the error on any quantity.\n3The data that are fitted can be found in Refs. [6, 10, 11] and [15]\u2013[29]. We treat the errors as in [9].\n3\nHowever, as demonstrated in [4], it more convenient and more numerically stable to diag-\nonalize either the Hessian or covariance matrix, and work in terms of the eigenvectors. Since\nthe Hessian and covariance matrices are symmetric they have a set of orthogonal eigenvectors\ndefined by\nn\u2211\nj=1\nCij(a)vjk = \u03bbkvik. (3)\nMoreover, because variations in some directions in parameter space lead to deterioration in\nthe quality of the fit far more quickly than others, the eigenvalues \u03bbk span several orders of\nmagnitude. Hence it is helpful to work in terms of the rescaled eigenvectors eik =\n\u221a\n\u03bbkvik. Then\nthe parameter displacements from the minimum may be expressed as\n\u2206ai \u2261 (ai \u2212 a0i ) =\nn\u2211\nk=1\neikzk, (4)\nor using the orthogonality of the eigenvectors\nzi = (\u03bbi)\n\u22121\nn\u2211\nk=1\neki\u2206ak, (5)\ni.e., the zi are the appropriately normalized combinations of the \u2206ak which define the orthogonal\ndirections in the space of deviation of parton parameters. In practice a zi is often dominated\nby a single \u2206ak.\n4\nThe error determination becomes much simpler in terms of the zi. The increase in \u03c7\n2 is\n\u2206\u03c72 =\nn\u2211\ni=1\nz2i , (6)\ni.e., the surface of constant \u03c72 is a hyper-sphere of given radius in z-space. Similarly the error\non the quantity F is now\n\u2206F =\n\u221a\n\u2206\u03c72\n[ n\u2211\ni=1\n(\n\u2202F\n\u2202zi\n)2 ]1\/2\n. (7)\nThus it is convenient to introduce parton sets S\u00b1k for each eigenvector direction, i.e., from\nEq. (4) we define\n\u2206ai(S\n\u00b1\nk ) = \u00b1teik, (8)\nwhere the tolerance t is defined by t =\n\u221a\n\u2206\u03c72 and \u2206\u03c72 is the allowed deterioration in fit quality\nfor the error determination. Then, assuming the quadratic behaviour of F about the minimum,\n(7) becomes the simple expression\n(\u2206F ) =\n1\n2\n[\nn\u2211\nk=1\n(\nF (S+k )\u2212 F (S\u2212k )\n)2 ] 12\n. (9)\n4CTEQ have even implemented the diagonalization procedure in the fitting procedure itself in order to\nimprove numerical stability [30]. We do not think this will have effects significant enough to outweigh the\ninherent errors in the Hessian approach described below.\n4\nIf everything were ideal this framework would provide us with a simple and efficient method\nfor calculating the uncertainty due to experimental errors on any quantities, where we would\nuse the standard choice of \u2206\u03c72 = 1. However, the real situation is not so simple, and there are\ntwo major complications we must overcome in order to obtain reliable results.\nAlthough, in principle, the 1\u03c3 uncertainty in any cross-section should be given by \u2206\u03c72 = 1,\nthe complicated nature of the global fitting procedure, where a large number of independent\ndata sets are used, results in this being an unrealistically small uncertainty [31]. This is un-\ndoubtedly due to some failure of the theoretical approximation to work absolutely properly\nover the full range of data, which introduces the type of theoretical errors outlined in the In-\ntroduction, and also due to some sources of experimental error not being precisely quantified.\nBoth problems are in practice extremely difficult to surmount. We shall implicitly ignore the\npotential theoretical error in this paper, but account for the lack of ideal behaviour in the\nframework by determining the uncertainties using a larger \u2206\u03c72. We estimate \u2206\u03c72 = 50 to be a\nconservative uncertainty (perhaps of the order of a 90% confidence level or a little less than 2\u03c3)\ndue to the observation that an increase of 50 in the global \u03c72, which has a value \u03c72 = 2328 for\n2097 data points, usually signifies that the fit to one or more data sets is becoming unaccept-\nably poor. We find that an increase \u2206\u03c72 of 100 normally means that some data sets are very\nbadly described by the theory. Though this estimation does not rely on any real mathematical\nfoundation we do not think it is any less valid than the approaches used in e.g. [5] or [1, 7], both\nof which ultimately appeal to some value judgment rather than using all available information\nin a statistically rigorous manner, and ultimately give similar results. The approaches [2, 3, 6]\ndo use \u2206\u03c72 = 1 but either rely on much smaller and more internally compatible data sets, or\nin some cases have rather small errors.\nThe second complication is the breakdown of the simple quadratic behaviour in terms of\nvariations of the parameters, i.e., the fact that Eq. (1) may receive significant corrections\nand the simple linear propagation of errors is therefore not accurate. Of course, we expect\nsome deviations from this simple form for very large \u2206\u03c72, but unfortunately very significant\ndeviations can occur for relatively small \u2206\u03c72, as outlined below. Due to the very large amount\nof data in our global fit, we have a lot of parameters in order to allow sufficient flexibility\nin the form of the parton distributions. Each of the valence quarks and the total sea quark\ncontribution are parameterized in the form\nxq(x,Q20) = A(1\u2212 x)\u03b7(1 + \u01ebx0.5 + \u03b3x)x\u03b4, (10)\nwhere for the valence quarks the normalization A is set by the number of valence quarks of\neach type. Because we find it necessary to have a negative input gluon at low x the gluon\nparameterization has been extended to\nxg(x,Q20) = Ag(1\u2212 x)\u03b7g(1 + \u01ebgx0.5 + \u03b3gx)x\u03b4g \u2212A\u2212(1\u2212 x)\u03b7\u2212x\u2212\u03b4\u2212 , (11)\nwhere Ag is determined by the momentum sum rule, and \u03b7\u2212 can be set to some fixed large value,\ne.g. 10 or 20, so that the second term only influences large x. The combination \u2206q = u\u00af \u2212 d\u00af\n5\nhas a slightly different parameterization, i.e.,\nx\u2206q(x,Q20) = A(1\u2212 x)\u03b7(1 + \u03b3x+ \u03b4x2)x\u03b4. (12)\nOverall, this gives 24 free parameters. In our standard fits we allow all these parameters to vary.\nHowever, when investigating in detail the small departures from the global minimum we notice\nthat a certain amount of redundancy in parameters leads to potentially disastrous departures\nfrom the behaviour in Eq. (1). For example, in the negative term in the gluon parameterization\nvery small changes in the value of \u03b4\u2212 can be compensated almost exactly by a change in A\u2212\nand (to a lesser extent) in the other gluon parameters over the range of x probed, and therefore\nchanges in \u03b4\u2212 lead to very small changes in \u03c7\n2. However, at some point the compensation starts\nto fail significantly and the \u03c72 increases dramatically. Hence, this certain degree of redundancy\nbetween \u03b4\u2212 and A\u2212 leads to a severe breaking of the quadratic behaviour in \u2206\u03c7\n2. Essentially\nthe redundancy between the parameters leads to a very flat direction in the eigenvalue space (a\nvery large\/small eigenvalue of the covariance\/Hessian matrix) which means that cubic, quartic\netc. terms dominate. During the process of diagonalization this bad behaviour feeds through\ninto the whole set of eigenvectors to a certain extent.\nTherefore, in order that the Hessian method work at all well we have to eliminate the largest\neigenvalues of the covariance matrix, i.e., remove the redundancy from the input parameters.\nIn order to do this we simply fix some of the parameters at their best fit values so that the\nHessian matrix only depends on a subset of parameters that are sufficiently independent that\nthe quadratic approximation is reasonable. In fact we finish up with 15 free parameters in total\n\u2013 3 for each of the 5 different types of input parton. In particular, fixing the other parameters\nat the best fit values we find that \u03b7g, \u03b4g and \u03b4\u2212 are sufficient for the gluon \u2013 one for high x,\none for medium x and one for low x. However, we emphasize that we cannot simply set the\nother parameters to zero. For example A\u2212 must be of a size as to allow a sufficiently negative\ninput gluon at low x with a sensible value of \u03b4\u2212, but we cannot allow it to vary simultaneously\nwith \u03b4\u2212. We could possibly allow one or two more parameters to be free, but judge that the\ndeterioration in the quality of the quadratic approximation does not outweigh the improvements\ndue to increased flexibility in the parton variations. We note that this problem seems to be a\nfeature of the full global fits obtained by CTEQ and MRST, and that the other fitting groups\nhave not yet needed to introduce enough parameters to notice such redundancy. It has clearly\nbeen noticed by CTEQ though, since in [4] they only have 16 free parameters out of a possible\n22, and in [5], where they use a significantly altered type of parameterization, they have only\n20 free parameters out of a possible 26.\nHence, we produce 30 sets of parton distributions labeled by S\u00b1k to go along with the central\nbest fit; that is 15 \u201c+\u201d sets corresponding to each eigenvector direction, and 15 \u201c\u2013\u201d sets5. Even\n5In order to produce the errors on the parton distributions a higher numerical accuracy was required than\nthat used when we previously found just the \u201cbest fit\u201d. This results in the partons from the central fit being\nvery slightly different to the standard MRST2001 partons, and we label them by MRST2001C. In fact some of\nthe input parameters are quite different to those in the MRST2001 default, but the partons themselves differ\nby fractions of a percent. This is an example of the redundancy in some input parameters noted above. The 31\nparton sets (S\u00b1\nk\n, MRST2001C) are available at http:\/\/durpdg.dur.ac.uk\/hepdata\/mrs .\n6\nthough we have limited the number of free parameters in the calculation of the Hessian matrix,\nwe note that we still have significant departure from the ideal quadratic behaviour. For the\n10 or so lowest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix the quadratic approximation is very good\n\u2013 the distance needed to go along one of the zi to produce \u2206\u03c7\n2 = 50 being the expected\u221a\n50 = 7.07 to good accuracy in both \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2013\u201d directions. However, for 4 or 5 of the largest\neigenvalues of the covariance matrix, corresponding mainly to the large-x d quark, large-x gluon\nand u\u00af\u2212 d\u00af distributions, the absolute scaling and symmetry break down somewhat. In the very\nworst case of the largest eigenvalue, the scale factors to produce \u2206\u03c72 = 50 are 9.5 and 4.5\nin the two opposite directions. In order to produce the sets corresponding to \u2206\u03c72 = 50 we\nhave to multiply the parton deviations required for \u2206\u03c72 = 1 by these scale factors rather than\nthe expected 7.07. (In fact we do this for all 30 sets, but in most cases the scale factor is in\nthe range 6.5\u20137.5.) Hence, as in [4, 5], this necessitates the supply of both \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2013\u201d sets,\nwhereas in the quadratic approximation one could easily be obtained from the other. Indeed\nfrom Fig. 9 of [4] it is clear that CTEQ encounter a breakdown of the quadratic behaviour of\nmuch the same type that we do.\nUsing the 30 parton sets S\u00b1k corresponding to the 15 eigenvector directions for variations of\nthe partons about the minimum \u03c72, one can use Eq. (7) to calculate the error for any quantity,\nassuming an allowed \u2206\u03c72 = 50. In fact it has been proposed [32] that one may also account\nfor some of the asymmetry due to departures from quadratic behaviour by replacing Eq. (9) by\nthe slightly more sophisticated form\n(\u2206F )+ =\n[\u2211n\nk=1\n(\nmax(F (S+k )\u2212 F (S0k), F (S\u2212k )\u2212 F (S0k), 0)\n)2 ] 12\n(\u2206F )\u2212 =\n[\u2211n\nk=1\n(\nmax(F (S0k)\u2212 F (S+k ), F (S0k)\u2212 F (S\u2212k ), 0)\n)2 ] 12\n, (13)\nwhere S0k represents the best fit set of partons. In [32] and [33] examples are discussed where\nthe use of Eq. (13) instead of Eq. (9) leads to not only an asymmetric error, but also a larger\nuncertainty overall. We find only fairly minor effects, with no real evidence that Eq. (13) leads\nto markedly more reliable results than Eq. (9), so we use the simpler Eq. (9) in this paper.\nAs an example of the use of the Hessian method we show in Figs. 1\u20134 the uncertainty on\nsome of the parton distributions at various values of Q2, namely the uV distribution, the dV\ndistribution and the gluon distribution respectively. As one sees, the uV distribution is very well\ndetermined, and the uncertainty shrinks slightly with increasing Q2. The lowest uncertainty\nis in the region of x = 0.2 where there are very accurate data which mainly constrain the\nvalence quarks. At lower x the direct constraint is on the sum of valence and sea quarks. The\ndV distribution is also well determined in general, but is rather more uncertain as we go to\nthe highest x values. The gluon distribution is known less well, but at the highest Q2 has an\nuncertainty of as little as 5% for x \u223c 0.05 where it is constrained by both dF2(x,Q2)\/d lnQ2\nof the HERA data and the lowest-ET Tevatron jet data. It becomes very uncertain for x \u2265 0.4\nwhere only the relatively imprecise highest-ET jet data provide any information. The fractional\nuncertainty at very small x decreases very rapidly as Q2 increases because much of the small-x\n7\ngluon at higher Q2 is generated from that at higher x via evolution. We also show the gluon at\nQ2 = 2 GeV2 explicitly in Fig. 4. At this low scale the central gluon is negative at x = 0.0001,\nbut we see that the gluon may be positive within the uncertainty. This just about persists\nif we go to as low as x = 10\u22125 at this Q2, but at our input scale Q20 = 1 GeV\n2 the gluon\nwould be negative for x less than 0.0005, outside the level of uncertainty chosen. Also shown\non the plots are the CTEQ6M partons. For the dV distribution the agreement is excellent. For\nthe uV distribution the agreement at x \u2265 0.05 is very good, but there is a discrepancy below\nthis value. However, in this range, the valence quarks become very small indeed and the data\nonly really constrain the total u distribution which is completely dominated by the sea. This\napparent discrepancy is probably due to parameterization effects, and is irrelevant in practice.\nHowever, in Fig. 3 we see that the MRST and CTEQ gluons show a genuine and significant\nlevel of incompatibility. We will comment on this more in Section 8.\nOne might worry that the fixing of some of the parameters, that determine the input\nparton distributions, will cast some doubt on the error obtained. However, we stressed that\nthese are largely redundant parameters, and we have checked that the errors obtained (when\nusing \u2206\u03c72 = 50) are indeed compatible with the errors obtained using more rigorous means,\ni.e., the Lagrange multiplier method, in the following sections.6 Nevertheless, it is a sign of\nthe breakdown of the quadratic approximation. Of more practical concern is the fact that\nthis breakdown is also exhibited in a non-trivial manner in some of the eigenvectors used \u2013\nparticularly those eigenvectors associated with the least known partons, e.g. the high-x down\nquark and gluon. The scaling has been designed to give correct results if \u2206\u03c72 = 50 is used.\nHowever, one cannot simply extrapolate to different choices of \u2206\u03c72. For example if \u2206\u03c72 = 25\nwere deemed a more suitable choice, in principle the error would just be that using Eq. (7)\ndivided by\n\u221a\n2, but the breakdown of quadratic behaviour does not guarantee this, especially for\nsome directions in parameter space. Also, if one wished to be very conservative in the estimation\nof an uncertainty, simple extrapolation cannot reveal when \u2206\u03c72 might start to increase rapidly.\nWe will see examples of this later.\nAlso we note that we have performed this analysis for a fixed value of the coupling constant:\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119. One can in principle include this as another free parameter. Indeed we then\nfind that the behaviour obeys the quadratic approximation quite well and that \u2206\u03c72 = 50\ngives an error of about \u00b10.003, corresponding well to our error of \u00b10.002 obtained in [9]\nusing \u2206\u03c72 = 20. We will discuss extractions of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) again in Section 8. However, for the\nHessian approach there is a slight difference between varying \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) and varying the parton\nparameters. When \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) is fixed the maximum error on any quantity is obtained from\n6We have checked the effects of using Eq. (13) instead of Eq. (9) in these comparisons. In all cases the former\nonly introduced a relatively small asymmetry in the uncertainty, with the average being very close indeed to the\nresult using the latter. Also, the asymmetry was of the same sign as that found using the Lagrangian approach\nonly half the time, i.e. the use of Eq. (13) did not reliably predict the direction of steeper increase of \u2206\u03c72,\neven when the asymmetry was quite large. We find this surprising, and have no good explanation. However,\nit illustrates the semi-qualitative nature of the Hessian approach compared to the more rigorous Lagrange\nMultiplier method.\n8\nsome linear combination of our different parton sets, and in principle one could reproduce the\nparticular parton set which corresponds to this linear combination, which would be a perfectly\nwell-defined set itself. However, a linear combination of \u03b1S(Q\n2) coming from contributions\nwith different \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) does not actually correspond to one particular choice of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) (each\ncontribution has a branch point at a different value of Q2, so a linear combination will have\nmultiple branch points), so one cannot precisely define a particular set of partons corresponding\nto a particular \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) for the extreme.\nHence, although the 30 parton sets obtained using the Hessian approach provide the most\nconvenient framework for calculating the uncertainties on a physical observable, for the reasons\ndescribed above we would also like to study an alternative approach, partially just to check how\nwell our adapted Hessian approach really works. A more robust method, which also allows us\nto directly investigate the partons, and \u03b1S, corresponding to the extreme variations of a given\nphysical quantity is the Lagrange multiplier method. We study this in detail below.\n3 Lagrange multiplier method\nIt is much more rigorous to investigate the allowed variation of a specific observable by using\nthe Lagrange multiplier method. This was also one of the approaches used by the CTEQ\ncollaboration [8]. In this, one performs a series of global fits while constraining the values \u03c3i\nof one, or more, physical quantities in the neighbourhood of their values \u03c30i obtained in the\nunconstrained global fit. To be precise, we minimize the function\n\u03a8(\u03bbi, a) = \u03c7\n2\nglobal(a) +\n\u2211\ni\n\u03bbi\u03c3i(a) (14)\nwith respect to the usual set a of parameters, which specify the parton distributions and the\ncoupling \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). This global minimization is repeated for many fixed values of the Lagrange\nmultipliers \u03bbi. At the minima, with the lowest \u03a8(\u03bbi, a), the observables have the values \u03c3i(a\u0302)\nand the value of \u03c72global(a\u0302) is the minimum for these particular values of \u03c3i. These optimum\nparameter sets a\u0302 depend on the fixed values of \u03bbi. Clearly, when \u03bbi = 0, we have \u03a8 =\n\u03c72global = \u03c7\n2\n0 and \u03c3i = \u03c3\n0\ni . In this way we are able to explore how the global description of\nthe data deteriorates as the \u03c3i(a\u0302) move away from the unconstrained best fit values \u03c3\n0\ni . Thus\nby spanning a range of \u03bbi we obtain the \u03c7\n2\nglobal profile for a range of values of \u03c3i about the\nbest fit values, \u03c30i . In this study we take the best fit values corresponding to the MRST2001\npartons [9].\nThis procedure involves none of the approximations involved in the Hessian approach. We\ncan use the full set of parameters in the fit, obtaining maximum flexibility in the partons without\nhaving to worry about the large correlations or anticorrelations between some parameters. We\nnever make any assumption about quadratic dependence on the parameters, and indeed, by\nusing different values of the Lagrange multipliers, we can map out precisely how the quadratic\napproximation breaks down in the uncertainty for any physical quantity. Also, one produces\n9\na particular set of partons with a particular value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) at every point in the space of\ncross-sections for the physical quantities mapped, so the interpretation of the extremes is more\nobvious and natural. Hence, in principle, this is a far superior method of obtaining uncertainties\nto the Hessian approach. However, it suffers from the large practical disadvantage that a series\nof global fits must be done every time one considers a new quantity. As examples we investigate\na number of interesting physical cases below.\n4 The charged-current structure functions FCC2 (e\n\u00b1p)\nThe \u2206\u03c72 contour plot for the variation of FCC2 (e\n+p) and FCC2 (e\n\u2212p) about their predicted values\nfrom the unconstrained global fit is shown in Fig. 5, where we allow \u03b1S to be a free parameter\n(unstarred labels) or fix it at the best fit value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119 (starred labels). We show\nthe contours for \u2206\u03c72 = 50, 100, etc. Overall, the ellipses one would expect from the quadratic\napproximation for \u2206\u03c72 in Section 2 are more or less what one sees, but there is a certain\nasymmetry in that \u03c72 increases rather more rapidly for an increase in both FCC2 (e\n+p) and\nFCC2 (e\n\u2212p) than for a corresponding decrease in both.\nThus, from Fig. 5, we see that the uncertainties of the FCC2 (e\n+p) and FCC2 (e\n\u2212p) structure\nfunctions at x = 0.5 and Q2 = 10, 000 GeV2 (due to the experimental errors on the data in the\nglobal fit) are about +15\u221212 % and \u00b12% respectively. In comparison, the values using the Hessian\napproach are \u00b110% and \u00b12% respectively, in good agreement, although slightly smaller for\nFCC2 (e\n+p). At this value of x the uncertainties in FCC2 (e\n+p) and FCC2 (e\n\u2212p) have a particularly\nsimple interpretation since FCC2 (e\n+p) is almost exactly proportional to the valence down quark\ndistribution, dV , and F\nCC\n2 (e\n\u2212p) is almost exactly proportional to the uV distribution. This\ncan clearly be seen in Fig. 6, which shows the u and d distributions for the extreme sets\n(T*,U*,V* and W*) corresponding to maximum and minimum FCC2 (e\n+p) and FCC2 (e\n\u2212p) (for\nthe case of fixed \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ)). Rather obviously the d distribution maximises at large x for the\ncase of maximum FCC2 (e\n+p) and minimises for minimum FCC2 (e\n+p), with similar behaviour\nfor the u distribution and FCC2 (e\n\u2212p). Note however that in each case the extreme in the\nparton distribution is not precisely at x = 0.5, but at slightly higher x, where the data are less\nconstraining. There are also sum rules on the partons which must be satisfied. It is also clear\nthat there is a strong inverse correlation between the u and d distributions. This is because\nthe data which constrain the relevant partons are the structure function measurements F2(lp),\nF2(ld) and F2(3)(\u03bd(\u03bd\u00af)p) which are essentially proportional to 4u+d, u+d and u+d respectively,\nwhere u \u223c 4d at x = 0.5. This constrains u far more than d as we have seen, but means that\nfor maximum variation in the partons a change in u must be compensated by a much larger\nopposite change in d. The result that the major axis of the ellipse for given change in \u2206\u03c72\nis approximately aligned along 8FCC2 (e\n+p) \u2212 FCC2 (e\u2212p) (i.e., 8d \u2212 u) is therefore not at all\nsurprising. The rate of quickest increase in \u03c72 is then along 8d + u, where the changes in the\npartons add in such a way as to maximise changes in the measured structure functions.\n10\nWe see that allowing \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) to also vary allows the error ellipses to grow slightly, mainly\nin width. Now the maximum and minimum allowed values of FCC2 (e\n\u2212p) (or u) correspond to\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.117 and 0.120 and to parton sets T and V respectively. Most of the constraining\ndata are for Q2 \u226a 10, 000 GeV2, and must be well fit, but smaller \u03b1S means slower evolution\nof the quarks and thus greater values of u and FCC2 (e\n\u2212p) at Q2 = 10, 000 GeV2. Opposite\nconsiderations lead to the maximum FCC2 (e\n\u2212p). Since the extrema of FCC2 (e\n+p) and d are\nmore involved, due to the negative correlation with the u distribution, they are less altered\nby allowing \u03b1S to vary; see sets U and W. We see that the axes of the ellipse are essentially\nunchanged when \u03b1S is left free. Thus Fig. 6 is much the same except that the variations for\nparton sets T and V are a little greater than for T\u2217 and V\u2217.\nIt is, of course, the fixed target data which constrain these cross-sections and the high-x\nquarks. It is very largely the BCDMS F2(ed) measurements which are responsible for the upper\nextremum in FCC2 (e\n+p). The best fit tends to overshoot these data in the region of x = 0.5,\nand a large increase in d makes the fit to these measurements very poor. For the extrema in\nFCC2 (e\n\u2212p) and u, the deterioration is more evenly spread over pretty much all the fixed target\ndata at x \u2243 0.5 (with the exception that the description of the BCDMS F2(d) measurements\nimproves slightly), but the cumulative result is a very poor fit. One of the worst instances of\ndeterioration is for the NMC F2(n)\/F2(p) ratio.\n5 W and H production at the LHC and Tevatron\nThe \u2206\u03c72 contour plot for the variation of \u03c3W and \u03c3H about their predicted values at the LHC\nenergy from the unconstrained global fit is shown in Fig. 7, where again we allow \u03b1S to be a\nfree parameter or fix it at \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119. Again we show the contours for \u2206\u03c7\n2 = 50, 100, etc.\nThis time the Hessian approach should work well, although the ellipses start becoming a little\nrectangular. Allowing \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) to vary, we see that the uncertainties of the W and H cross-\nsections at the LHC (due to the experimental errors on the data in the global fit) are about\n+2.5\n\u22122.0 % and \u00b13% respectively, and are positively correlated.\nAgain this analysis also gives information on the uncertainties of particular parton distribu-\ntions. To be specific, the parton sets which correspond to the points A,B,C,D, on the \u2206\u03c72 = 50\ncontour in Fig. 7, give the uncertainties in the parton distributions that dominantly determine\n\u03c3W and \u03c3H in the kinematic domain x \u223c 0.005, Q2 \u223c 104 GeV2 relevant toW andH production\nat the LHC. The extrema in \u03c3W , represented by A and C, correspond to variations in the sea\nquark distributions, while the extrema in \u03c3H , represented by B and D, correspond to variations\nin the gluon distribution and \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). The values of \u03b1S for sets A and C are 0.119 and 0.118\nrespectively, both very close to the default MRST2001 value, showing that \u03c3W , which begins\nat zeroth order, is insensitive to \u03b1S. However, the values of \u03b1S for fits B and D are 0.120 and\n0.117 respectively, reflecting the fact that \u03c3H \u221d \u03b12S. This is well illustrated by repeating the\nentire analysis with \u03b1S fixed at the default value (0.119) obtained in the unconstrained global\n11\nfit [9]. The \u2206\u03c72 = 50 and 100 contours for this additional analysis are shown by the smaller\nshapes in Fig. 7. We can see that the uncertainty on \u03c3W is almost unchanged, while that for\n\u03c3H is reduced to about \u00b12%. The corresponding values using the Hessian approach are \u00b11.8%\nand \u00b11.8%, in good agreement but slightly smaller in each case.\nThe up quark distribution for each \u2018extrema\u2019 set with fixed \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) is shown in Fig. 8(a)\nand the gluon distribution in Fig. 8(b). We see that indeed the parton distributions do reflect\nthe extrema in the cross-sections in a fairly simple manner. The quark densities at high x show\nalmost no variation between fits since they are well constrained at high x and because the W\nand H production cross-sections are sensitive to the partons at an x range centered at a few\n\u00d710\u22123. Indeed the maximum and minimum W cross-sections correspond to the maximum and\nminimum sea quarks for x \u2264 0.05 at Q2 \u223c 10, 000 GeV2. The maximum and minimum Higgs\ncross-sections correspond to the maximum and minimum gluon distributions in the same sort\nof range, although the large x gluon must now decrease for increases in the small x partons,\nand vice versa, in order to maintain the momentum sum rule. The strong correlation between\nthe two cross-sections is due to the fact that at high Q2 the size of the quark distribution at\nsmall x is mainly determined by evolution, and the larger the small x gluon the stronger the\nquark evolution (and vice versa). When \u03b1S is left free the resulting partons at the extrema are\nsimilar to the fixed \u03b1S results. However, in this case, their variation is a little larger at smaller\nQ2, since the slight changes in \u03b1S lead to different rates of evolution.\nFor the case of fixed \u03b1S the main contributions to \u2206\u03c7\n2 come from the HERA small-x\nstructure function data and, because of the changes in the high x gluon, also from the Tevatron\njet data. For the upper extrema in \u03c3W and \u03c3H the slope dF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2 tends to be too\nlarge for x \u2264 0.001, while for the lower extrema the slope is too small. In both cases the fit to\njet data deteriorates due to the shape of the high-x gluon becoming wrong. When \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) is\nallowed to vary the data which are particularly sensitive to this also play a role, for example\nthe BCDMS data are fitted less well when \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.120 in fit B, and the NMC data are\ndescribed less well when \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.117 in fit D.\nThe corresponding \u2206\u03c72 contour plot for the Tevatron is shown in Fig. 9, where again we\neither allow \u03b1S to be a free parameter or fix it at \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119. We see that the uncertainty\nof theW cross-section at the Tevatron (due to the experimental errors on the data in the global\nfit) has decreased to about \u00b11.5% while that for the Higgs has increased to about \u00b18% for\nvarying \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), and that the correlation has disappeared. For \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) fixed at 0.119 \u03c3W is\nagain largely unaffected, but the uncertainty of \u03c3H now more than halves to about\n+3\n\u22124.5% ,\nreflecting the fact that this time the maximum and minimum Higgs cross-sections for variable\n\u03b1S correspond to \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.1215 and \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.116 respectively. With \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) fixed\nthere is now even a very slight anti-correlation between the cross-sections.\nThe extrema in \u03c3W , represented by P and R, correspond roughly to variations in the quark\ndistributions at x \u223c 0.04, while the extrema in \u03c3H , represented by Q and S, correspond to\nvariations in the gluon distribution at x \u223c 0.06 and \u03b1S(M2Z). The values of x sampled at\n12\nthe Tevatron are an order of magnitude greater than at the LHC. This, coupled with the fact\nthat it is a proton\u2013antiproton collider, rather than a proton\u2013proton collider, complicates the\ninterpretation of the extremes of the cross-sections in terms of partons.\nThe up quark distribution for each extrema set with fixed \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) is shown in Fig. 10(a) and\nthe gluon distribution in Fig. 10(b). The corresponding distributions obtained when \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ)\nis allowed to vary are shown in Fig. 11. We first consider the cases of the maximum and\nminimum W cross-sections, which are insensitive to whether \u03b1S is left to vary or not. For\ndiscussion purposes, let us consider only the u and d quark flavour contributions. Then the W\ncross-section is roughly proportional to\nu(x1)d(x2) + d(x1)u(x2) + u\u00af(x1)d\u00af(x2) + d\u00af(x1)u\u00af(x2) (15)\nwhere 1 refers to the proton and 2 to the antiproton and x1x2 = M\n2\nW\/s. Hence the average\nvalue of xi = 0.04. This is sufficiently large that there is a distinct difference between the\nquark and antiquark distributions, and the contribution to the cross-section from the quark\ncontribution is the greater. Hence, one can decrease the cross-section by replacing a quark by\nits antiquark at x = 0.05, or vice versa. Of course, there is a fundamental constraint in doing\nthis due to the sum rule for each valence quark. However, the only real experimental constraint\nis from the CCFR F3(x,Q\n2) data, all other structure function data being insensitive to the\ndistinction between quark and antiquark. In the optimum global fit most data would like there\nto be more quarks at high x, while the CCFR F3(x,Q\n2) data would prefer more valence quarks\nat x \u2264 0.1. This leads to a compromise where for the best fit the CCFR F3(x,Q2) data at low\nx are undershot. The minimum \u03c3W is therefore achieved mainly by this exchange of quark for\nantiquark, which most data are happy with, and hence the deterioration in \u03c72 at P (and P\u2217) is\nalmost entirely from the description of the CCFR F3(x,Q\n2) data. Hence, both the gluon and\nquark distribution for P (and P\u2217) are hardly changed, as seen in Figs. 10 and 11, but u \u2212 u\u00af\nand d \u2212 d\u00af decrease for x \u223c 0.05. Going in the other direction, an increase in qV (0.05) and\nthe consequent decrease in the valence quarks at higher x causes a large penalty in \u03c72 and the\nmaximum \u03c3W is achieved in a different manner. At x \u223c 0.05 the quark evolves much more\nslowly than at x \u223c 0.05 and the density at Q2 \u223c 10, 000 GeV2 is determined largely by the\ninput value, and modified by the rate of evolution. Hence the maximum \u03c3W is achieved by\nhaving a large quark distribution at x \u223c 0.05 at low Q2 and also by having an enhanced gluon\nat x \u223c 0.05 to increase evolution. These are displayed in Figs. 10 and 11. The deterioration\nin \u03c72 then comes mostly from the low Q2 quarks causing an overshooting of NMC structure\nfunction data, but there is also a contribution due to the enhanced gluon at x \u223c 0.1 causing it\nto be smaller for x > 0.1 and hence fitting the Tevatron jet data less well.\nThe extrema of the Higgs cross-section are also slightly complicated. It is not possible to\nsimply increase or decrease the gluon in a range centered on x \u223c 0.05 because this is precisely\nthe x region where the majority of the gluon\u2019s momentum is carried, and this total is very\nwell constrained by the momentum sum rule and the accurate high x quark determination.\nTherefore, for fixed \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) the change in \u03c3H is largely reliant on the fact that this total cross-\nsection actually probes quarks within about an order of magnitude either side of the central\n13\nproduction value of x = MH\/\n\u221a\ns. Hence, as we see from Fig. 10 the maximum cross-section is\nobtained from the gluon in set Q\u2217 which is slightly reduced for x < 0.04 and more enhanced for\nx > 0.04 and the minimum cross-section is obtained from the gluon in set S\u2217 which is slightly\nincreased for x < 0.04 and more reduced for x > 0.04. In both cases those data sets sensitive\nto the small x and large x gluon, i.e., HERA structure function data and Tevatron jet data\nrespectively, are those for which the description deteriorates. When \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) is allowed to go\nfree it varies by about \u00b10.003 and there is a large increase in the variation of \u03c3H . This is not\nonly because \u03c3H \u221d \u03b12S but also because the HERA data anti-correlate \u03b1S and the small x gluon.\nTherefore, in set Q, for example, the increased value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) allows the small x gluon to\nget much smaller, and the high x gluon much larger, compared to set Q\u2217. This compensation\nbetween \u03b1S and the small x gluon also means that HERA data remains well fit, and it is the jet\ndata (particularly CDF), sensitive to large x, and the large \u03b1S-phobic BCDMS data, for which\nthe description deteriorates. Similar considerations apply to set S as compared to S\u2217. Here it\nis the D0 jet data and the small \u03b1S-phobic SLAC and NMC data that are badly fit.\nFor \u2206\u03c72 = 50 the Hessian approach gives an uncertainty of \u00b11.2% for \u03c3W and \u00b13% for \u03c3H ,\nat the Tevatron energy. In simplistic terms this is in good agreement, but a little smaller for\nthe gluon-sensitive Higgs cross-section. However, in this case we see from Fig. 9 a very marked\nasymmetry on the contour plot. For fixed \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) the ellipses are certainly not centered on\nthe best fit values, and for varying \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) we see that \u03c7\n2 is clearly increasing far more rapidly\nfor increases in the predicted W cross-section than for corresponding decreases. Thus, it is\nclear that within the framework of this fit, increases of the cross-section of much more than\n3% are completely ruled out, whereas decreases of the same amount are much more acceptable.\nThis information would be largely lost in the Hessian approach, and for these quantities the\nLagrange multiplier method does supply some important additional information.\n6 The ratio of W\u2212 to W+ production at the LHC\nThe ratio of the W\u2212 to the W+ production cross-sections at hadron colliders is a particularly\ninteresting observable. The measurement is expected to be quite precise (better than \u00b11% at\nthe LHC, see e.g. [34]), since many of the experimental uncertainties cancel in the ratio. The\nuncertainty in the prediction of the ratio at the LHC can be deduced from the \u2206\u03c72 profile\nshown in Fig. 12. Taking, as before, the \u2206\u03c72 = 50 measure, we obtain \u2206(W\u2212\/W+) = \u00b11.3%,\nand the Hessian approach is in very good agreement with this. Since the W\u2212\/W+ ratio is\nsensitive to the ratio of the d and u quark distributions, it is not surprising that the increase\nin \u03c72 is almost entirely due to the NMC F2(n)\/F2(p) data [25].\nA detailed discussion of theW\u2212\/W+ ratio may be found in Ref. [35]. Consider, for instance,\nthe ratio as a function of the W rapidity y\nd\u03c3\/dy(W\u2212)\nd\u03c3\/dy(W+)\n\u2243 d(x1)u\u00af(x2)\nu(x1)d\u00af(x2)\n\u2243 d(x1)\nu(x1)\n, (16)\n14\nwhere x1 =MW e\ny\/\n\u221a\ns = 0.0057ey at the LHC. In Eq. (16) we have ignored, for simplicity, the\ncontributions involving strange and heavier quarks. Thus a measurement of the ratio at large y\nwould provide a direct determination of d\/u at large x. For example, for y \u2243 4, we measure d\/u\nat x \u223c 0.3 at the LHC. Of course, it is the decay lepton rapidity that is measured, rather than\nthe parent W rapidity, and so the ratio in a given rapidity bin will have a greater uncertainty\nthan that for \u03c3(W\u2212)\/\u03c3(W+).\n7 The moments of the (u\u2013d) distribution\nThe parton distribution functions of the nucleon are fundamental quantities that should, in\nprinciple, be calculable from first principles in QCD. In particular, the x moments of parton\ndistributions at a given scale Q2 are related, by the operator product expansion, to a product\nof perturbatively calculable Wilson coefficients and non-perturbative matrix elements of quark\nand gluon operators. The latter can be computed using lattice QCD and, indeed, in recent\nyears the precision of the lattice calculations has improved significantly. Although in principle\nthe lattice results can be related to moments of physical structure functions, in practice it is\nmore efficient to use parton distributions determined in a global fit to represent the physical\n\u2018data\u2019. Comparisons of recent lattice moment calculations with the predictions of earlier MRS\nparton distributions are encouraging, see for example [13, 14].\nIn order to quantify the agreement between the lattice calculations and the parton dis-\ntribution predictions it is obviously important to know the uncertainties in the latter. It is\nstraightforward to apply the Lagrange multiplier method used in previous sections to deter-\nmine the uncertainties in observable cross-sections to the moments of parton distributions.\nTo avoid contamination from gluon contributions, the lattice calculations focus on the mo-\nments of non-singlet quark operators. For example, lattice results are available for the first\nthree moments of the combination u\u2212 d, i.e.,\nMu\u2212dN (Q\n2) =\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx xN\u22121 [u(x,Q2)\u2212 d(x,Q2)] (17)\nwith N = 2, 3, 4. The predictions of the MRST2001 set (at Q2 = 4 GeV2) for these moments\nare given in Table 1.\nThe \u2206\u03c72 contour plot for the (percentage) variation of the second and third moments about\ntheir predicted values is shown in Fig. 13. We again show the \u2206\u03c72 = 50 and 100 contours\ncorresponding to the fixed \u03b1S analysis, but there is evidently little difference between the fixed\nand variable coupling results in this case.\nAs expected, there is a strong positive correlation between the two moments. Using the\n\u2206\u03c72 = 50, varying \u03b1S criterion for defining a conservative error, we obtain errors of \u00b14.2%,\n\u00b14.8% and \u00b15.0% for the second, third and fourth moments respectively. The corresponding\npredictions for the errors on the moments are also given in Table 1. The increasing relative\n15\nerror with increasing moment is to be expected \u2013 higher moments probe the x\u2192 1 region where\nthere are fewer DIS structure function data. Again we notice that there is a small asymmetry\nin the contours \u2013 the increase in \u03c72 when both moments increase being less severe than when\nboth moments decrease.\nN Mu\u2212dN (4 GeV\n2) % error\n2 0.1655(70) 4.2\n3 0.0544(26) 4.8\n4 0.0232(12) 5.0\nTable 1: The moments and their errors of the (u\u2013d) distribution, Eq. (17), predicted at Q2 =\n4 GeV2 using MRST2001 partons [9].\nThe uncertainties on the moments using the Lagrange multiplier method with a fixed \u03b1S\nare slightly smaller: \u00b14.1%, \u00b14.3% and \u00b14.7% for the second, third and fourth moments\nrespectively. These results are in excellent agreement with the (fixed \u03b1S) Hessian approach,\nwhere the corresponding errors are \u00b13.9%, \u00b14.3% and \u00b14.6%.\nSince, as we have already seen in Section 4, the u quark at high x is far more constrained\nthan the d quark, the allowed variation in these moments is mainly due to variations in the\ndV distribution. The minimum extremum (H in Fig. 13) of the moments is therefore due to\nthe largest allowed dV distribution at high x and arises from a similar set of partons to those\nfor the maximum FCC2 (e\n+p). Thus, as in this previous case, it is mainly the comparison to\nthe BCDMS F2(ed) measurements which causes the deterioration in the quality of the fit. The\nmaximum of the moments (G in Fig. 13) corresponds roughly to the minimum dV distribution\nat high x and it is largely the fit to the F2(n)\/F2(p) ratio that breaks down.\nFor a number of years, lattice QCD has been used to calculate the moments of nucleon\nstructure functions from first principles. The most recent comprehensive results are from the\nLHPC-SESAM [13] and QCDSF [14] collaborations. Although the comparisons with experi-\nment (via parton distributions obtained from global fits) are encouraging, there are still many\nproblems to be overcome, for example finite lattice spacing and volume effects, renormalization\nand mixing of operators, unquenching and chiral extrapolation to physical quark masses. A\ncomparison with the recent lattice results [13, 14] and the above MRST2001 moment predic-\ntions reveals that (a) the errors in the latter are at present significantly smaller than in the\nformer, especially for the higher moments, and (b) the lattice results for the moments are sys-\ntematically higher. The explanation appears to be that the linear chiral extrapolation used in\nthe lattice determinations is not valid \u2013 non-perturbative long-distance effects in the nucleon\ngives rise to nonlinear, non-analytic dependence on mq [36]\u2013[40] which is particularly important\nat small mq. In the most recent analyses (see for example the comprehensive study in [41]),\nthe experimental (i.e., pdf) values for the moments are used to constrain a priori unknown\n16\nnon-perturbative parameters which enter in the non-analytic terms in the chiral extrapolation\nformula. It will be interesting to investigate the effect of using the new MRST2001 moment\npredictions and errors in such studies.\n8 Comparison between different central parton sets\nSo far in this paper we have investigated the uncertainty on physical quantities coming from the\nexperimental error of the measurements used to determine the parton distributions. We have\ndiscussed both the Hessian and Lagrange Multiplier approaches, concluding that the latter is in\nprinciple preferable, but recognizing the practical advantages of the former. We have compared\nthe results each provide for the uncertainties using the \u2206\u03c72 = 50 criterion, noting that they\nare generally in good agreement. The Hessian approach does tend to give slightly smaller\nuncertainties for the quantities sensitive to the least well-determined partons, i.e., \u03c3H which is\nsensitive to the gluon distribution and FCC2 (e\n+p) which is sensitive to the high-x down quark\ndistribution. This is probably partly due to the neglected effect of the not entirely redundant\nparameters, and partly due to errors associated with those eigenvectors which do not respect\nthe quadratic approximation for \u2206\u03c72 too well, which indeed are mainly concerned with the\ngluon and high x down quark. However, the discrepancy is quite small, and we judge that we\ncan trust the Hessian approach, at least for \u2206\u03c72 in the region of 50 or less, to give quantitative\nresults. Hence, for fixed \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) = 0.119, we have made available 30 parton sets corresponding\nto the 15 different eigenvector directions in the space of variation of parton parameters away\nfrom their values at the minimum \u03c72 of the global fit, each set corresponding to an increase in\n\u03c72 of 50. These can easily be used to obtain the error on any physical quantity, as outlined\nin Section 2. We have also made available various parton sets with fixed and varying \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ)\ncorresponding to extreme variations in the predictions for various important cross-sections and\nother relevant observables.\nWe note that the uncertainties obtained due to the errors on the experimental data are\ngenerally very small, of the order of 1\u2212 5%, except for quantities sensitive to the high-x down\nquark and gluon, where they can approach 10%. However, in all of this we have implicitly\nassumed that the theoretical procedure is precisely compatible with the data used, we have\nnot considered the uncertainties due to (i) the data sets chosen, (ii) the choice of starting\nparameterizations, (iii) the heavy target corrections, etc. In practice this is far from true,\nas discussed in the Introduction. In this final section we acknowledge this to some extent\nand investigate qualitatively the impact of the initial assumptions going into the fit on the\nuncertainty on some quantities. In order to do this we first perform a slightly updated fit of\nour own (which includes minor modifications in terms of parameterization and the treatment\nof errors and data sets) so as to produce the best set of up-to-date partons. This was partially\ninspired by the question of why CTEQ6 [5] gives a much better fit to the Tevatron jet data than\nMRST2001, but also by the availability of new ZEUS data. We call the new set MRST2002\n17\npartons.7\n8.1 CTEQ6, MRST2001 and a new parton set (MRST2002)\nWe found that we can improve the fits to jets within the global fit by a couple of modifications.\nIn order to obtain the best global fit with partons input at Q20 = 1 GeV\n2 we had previously\nfound that we needed a parameterization which allows the gluon to go negative at small x.\nHence we used\nxg(x,Q20) = Ag(1\u2212 x)\u03b7g(1 + \u01ebgx0.5 + \u03b3gx)x\u03b4g \u2212A\u2212(1\u2212 x)\u03b7\u2212x\u2212\u03b4\u2212 , (18)\nwhere A\u2212 \u223c 0.2, \u03b4\u2212 \u223c 0.3 and \u03b7\u2212 was fixed at \u223c 10, so as not to affect the high x distribution.\nUnexpectedly, allowing \u03b7\u2212 to vary to\u223c 25 resulted in a slight improvement in the fit to Tevatron\njets. We also modified our treatment of the errors for the Drell\u2013Yan data [28]. The fit to these\ndata actually competes with that to the jets, and using only statistical errors, as in our previous\nstudies (the systematic errors being defined a little vaguely), over-emphasizes the effect of the\nDrell\u2013Yan measurements. Adding 5% systematic errors in quadrature to the statistical errors\n(which is probably the best approach [28]) also improves the fit to the jet data. Both these\nmodifications appear appropriate and are implemented in our updated set. Also included in\nthe new analysis is the new ZEUS high-Q2 data [42], which has little effect on the partons.\nThe only significant change in the MRST2002 partons, compared to MRST2001 partons [9], is\nan increase in the gluon at high x, which we show in Fig. 14. The fit to the Tevatron jet data\nnow has \u03c72 = 154\/113 compared to \u03c72 = 170\/113 for MRST2001, and the fit to The Drell\u2013Yan\ndata with 5% systematic errors has \u03c72 = 187\/136. The quality of fit for all other data sets is\nalmost identical to that for the MRST2001 partons.\nThe CTEQ6 partons are very similar to the MRST2001 (and MRST2002) partons in most\naspects. However, in this CTEQ analysis [5] a number of different choices are made about\nthe way in which the fit is implemented, which leads mainly to a significantly different gluon\ndistribution. These differences are: the development of a different type of parameterization\nfor the partons, which allows for a different shape at very high x; CTEQ omit data below\nQ2 = 4 GeV2, compared to our choice of Q2 = 2 GeV2; they do not fit to some data sets used\nin [9], i.e., they omit SLAC and one H1 high-Q2 set of F2 data; they use 10% systematic errors\n(in quadrature) for Drell\u2013Yan data; moreover, CTEQ have a positive-definite small-x gluon at\ntheir starting scale of Q20 = 1.69 GeV\n2. They also use a massless charm prescription and there\nare various other minor differences as compared with MRST.8\nThe CTEQ6 gluon is also shown in Fig. 14. Clearly MRST2002 has a similar high-x gluon\nto CTEQ6, both being larger than MRST2001. However, the MRST gluons are different from\nthe CTEQ6 gluon at smaller x due to their freedom to have a negative input distribution, and\n7The MRST2002 parton set can be found at http:\/\/durpdg.dur.ac.uk\/hepdata\/mrs .\n8The way in which these different assumptions lead to an improved fit to the Tevatron jet data is outlined\nin [43].\n18\ndue to slight differences in the choice of data sets fitted. The different assumptions made in\nobtaining the CTEQ partons, although they improve the quality of the jet fit, do not lead to\nthe best fit when including the data sets omitted by CTEQ and the fit is not good at all for\ndata with Q2 < 4 GeV2. Hence, within the context of trying to obtain as inclusive a global fit\nas possible using NLO QCD, we take MRST2002 to be the best set of parton distributions.\n8.2 Comparison of predictions for \u03c3W and for \u03c3H\nThe predictions forW and Higgs cross-sections using the different partons are shown in Fig. 15.\nSince MRST2002 only differs from MRST2001 in the high x gluon, to which these cross-\nsections are insensitive, the predictions for MRST2002 are very similar to those of MRST2001.\n(Hence our decision to keep MRST2001 partons as the base set for this paper). However, the\ncorresponding predictions obtained using the CTEQ6 partons are quite different. At the LHC\nthe prediction for \u03c3W is similar, but \u03c3H is towards the top of our (qualitative) 95% confidence\nlevel. From Fig. 14 this is clearly due to the larger gluon in the x \u223c 0.005 region, which is due\nto the positive definite input for the CTEQ6 gluon. At the Tevatron the discrepancy between\nCTEQ6 and MRST is even larger. The CTEQ6 predictions for both \u03c3W and \u03c3H are effectively\ncompletely outside our expectations. The reason for the small prediction of \u03c3H is evident from\nFig. 14\u2014the CTEQ6 gluon is considerably smaller in the region of x = 0.1. This, in turn,\nis then responsible for a slower evolution of the quarks, making them smaller at high Q2 and\nhence making \u03c3W smaller. Presumably the difference comes about because CTEQ6 use a more\nrestricted form of the gluon and omit one H1 data set and Q2 \u2264 4 GeV2 data which prefer larger\ndF2(x,Q\n2)\/d lnQ2. Whatever the precise reasons for the discrepancies, it is clear that different\nchoices for the overall framework of the global fit can completely outweigh the uncertainties\ndue to errors on the data actually chosen to go into the fit. It would be easy to illustrate similar\ntypes of discrepancy comparing to other alternative sets of partons\u2014in particular, due to the\nabsence of the Tevatron jets in the fits, many of the parton sets in [1]\u2013[7] have rather smaller\ngluons at large x, and would have different predictions for various quantities sensitive to the\nhigh-x gluon.\n8.3 Comparison of predictions for \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ)\nWe also find a large variation in the values of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) extracted from the fits of the differ-\nent collaborations: CTEQ6 [5], ZEUS [7], MRST2001 [9], H1 [6], Alekhin [3] and Giele et al.\n(GKK) [2]. The resulting values of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) are listed in Table 2, together with the determi-\nnation of this work (MRST2002), in order of decreasing tolerance (\n\u221a\n\u2206\u03c72), which is reflected\nin the size of the corresponding experimental error. Not all are presented as determinations\nof \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), but all are extracted using the same criteria as for the uncertainty on partons in\nthe respective fit, and hence should be as reliable. Clearly there is a very large variation, with\nsome very low values. The uncertainties due to experimental errors are determined in different\n19\nGroup variation \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ)\nof \u03c72\nCTEQ6 \u2206\u03c72 = 100 0.1165\u00b1 0.0065(exp)\nZEUS \u2206\u03c72eff = 50 0.1166\u00b1 0.0049(exp)\u00b1 0.0018(model) \u00b10.004(theory)\nMRST02 \u2206\u03c72 = 20 0.1195\u00b1 0.002(exp)\u00b1 0.003(theory)\nMRST01 \u2206\u03c72 = 20 0.1190\u00b1 0.002(exp)\u00b1 0.003(theory)\nH1 \u2206\u03c72 = 1 0.115\u00b1 0.0017(exp) +0.0009\u22120.0005 (model) \u00b10.005(theory)\nAlekhin \u2206\u03c72 = 1 0.1171\u00b1 0.0015(exp)\u00b1 0.0033(theory)\nGKK \u2206\u03c72eff = 1 0.112\u00b1 0.001(exp)\nTable 2: Values of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) and its error from different NLO QCD fits.\nfashions in each case, and a summary can be found in [44]. We use \u2206\u03c72eff for the ZEUS determi-\nnation [7], because they use the offset method for determining uncertainties which for \u2206\u03c72 = 1\ngives a larger uncertainty than the more common Hessian method. ZEUS estimate that this\nis equivalent to \u2206\u03c72 \u2248 50 if they were to use the same treatment of errors as CTEQ. We also\nuse \u2206\u03c72eff for the GKK value [2], because the uncertainties are obtained using confidence limits,\nbut the error quoted corresponds to the one sigma usually associated with \u2206\u03c72 = 1.\nThe model errors incorporate such effects as the heavy quark prescription and masses,\nparameterizations, changes in the starting scale of evolution etc. The theory error is often\ndetermined by variation of renormalization and factorization scales, though MRST use an\nestimate appealing to current knowledge of NNLO and resummations, which we feel is more\nreliable. Since each fit is centered on NLO QCD with scales equal to Q2, the \u201ctheory errors\u201d\nare very strongly correlated, and cannot therefore be responsible for the differences. These\ndiscrepancies are undoubtedly due to the assumptions going into the fits, mainly on which data\nsets are included and which cuts on Q2 and W 2 are used.\nMRST, who obtain the largest value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), use the widest range of data sets and also\nthe least conservative cuts.9 CTEQ use only a slightly smaller number of data sets but also\ncut data below Q2 = 4 GeV2, as described previously. They also use a definition of the NLO\ncoupling which truncates the solution of the renormalization group equation, whereas most\n9The slightly different treatment in this work (MRST2002) leads to a marginal raising of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ\n) as compared\nto MRST2001 [9], as seen in Table 2. We still use \u2206\u03c72 = 20 for our one-sigma uncertainty, since if \u2206\u03c72 = 50\ncorresponds to 90% confidence level, or 1.65 sigma, simple scaling implies that one sigma corresponds to \u2206\u03c72 =\n50\/(1.65)2, i.e. \u2206\u03c72 = 20 to a good approximation.\n20\nother groups use the full solution of the NLO equation. Both approaches are equally correct,\nbut the truncation of the solution leads to a slightly higher value of \u03b1S(Q\n2) at scales below\nM2Z , for the same value of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), than the other method, and thus tends to yield a lower\n\u03b1S(M\n2\nZ). CTEQ also have a very conservative estimate of the error, though it is meant to be\nsomewhat more than a one-sigma error. ZEUS and Alekhin use a similar selection of data sets,\ni.e., HERA DIS data (only ZEUS data in the former case) and a number of fixed target DIS\ndata sets. Hence, it is unsurprising that they obtain similar central values of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), with\nrespective errors which are easily explained by their choices of \u2206\u03c72. H1 and GKK both use a\nsmall number of sets of data: the former collaboration uses H1 DIS data [6, 10] and BCDMS\nfixed-target proton DIS data [22], while GKK use older H1 DIS data [45] together with BCDMS\nand E665 [26] fixed-target proton DIS data. Both determinations are heavily influenced by the\nBCDMS proton data set which prefers rather small10 \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ), and this feeds into the final\nvalues. Also, both are strict in their statistical interpretation, obtaining small uncertainties,\neven with relatively small data samples. Finally we note that only CTEQ and MRST include\nthe Tevatron jet data in their analyses. This is relevant because of the \u03b1S\u2013gluon correlation.\n8.4 Final comment\nFrom the discussion of the previous two subsections, it is clear that different ideas about the\nbest way to perform a NLO fit can lead to a wide variation in both the central values and\nthe errors of \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) as well as in predictions for physical quantities such as \u03c3W and \u03c3H . The\nfact that the various \u2018NLO\u2019 fits can yield such different outputs is disturbing, and is indicative\nof the uncertainty arising from theoretical assumptions. Indeed, we have always believed that\n\u2018theory\u2019, rather than experiment, will provide the dominant source of error [44]. We have\nalready produced approximate NNLO parton distributions and predictions [47] (based on the\napproximate splitting functions [48] obtained from the known NNLO moments [49]), and find,\nfor example, that the NNLO W cross-section at the Tevatron is 4% higher than at NLO, and\nbelieve that this result is reliable. This change is somewhat larger than the uncertainty due to\nexperimental errors shown in Fig. 9. Moreover, W production is likely to be subject to smaller\ntheoretical uncertainty than many other observables\u2014particularly those directly related to the\ngluon. Our estimates for the uncertainty in FL(x,Q\n2) at small x are 10% or more even at\nQ2 = 10, 000 GeV2, and significantly larger at lower Q2, for example. Hence, an understanding\nof theoretical uncertainties is clearly a priority at present, and a preliminary attempt at this\nwill be the subject of a future publication [50].\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Mandy Cooper-Sarkar, Vladimir Chekelian, Dan Stump and Wu-ki\nTung for useful discussions.

The superimposed solid \u2206\u03c72 = 50, 100 contours are obtained if \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) is\nfixed at 0.119.\n32\nUncertainty in u quark distribution (\u03b1\ns\n fixed)\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1\nx\nRatio MRST(LHCA*,B*,C*,D*)\/MRST2001\nfor u quark at Q2 = 10 GeV2\nA*\nB*\nC*\nD*\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1\nx\nRatio MRST(LHCA*,B*,C*,D*)\/MRST2001\nfor u quark at Q2 = 104 GeV2\nUncertainty in gluon distribution (\u03b1\ns\n fixed)\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1x\nRatio MRST(LHCA*,B*,C*,D* )\/MRST2001\nfor gluon at Q2 = 10 GeV2\nA*\nB*\nC*\nD*\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1x\nRatio MRST(LHCA*,B*,C*,D*)\/MRST2001\nfor gluon at Q2 = 104 GeV2\nFigure 8: The up quark and gluon distributions at Q2 = 10 and 104 GeV2 in the extrema global\nfits on the \u2206\u03c72 = 50 contour of the \u03c3W,H(LHC) plot of Fig. 7 for \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) fixed at 0.119.\n33\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4\nPer cent change in W cross section\n\u03c72 increase in global analysis as the\nW and H cross sections are varied at the TEVATRON\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n\u2022P\n\u2022Q\n\u2022 R\n\u2022\nS\nPe\nr c\nen\nt c\nha\nng\ne \nin\n H\n c\nro\nss\n se\nct\nio\nn\n+\n50*\n100*\n\u2022P*\n\u2022Q*\n\u2022 R*\n\u2022\nS*\nFigure 9: As for Fig. 7, but for the Tevatron energy of\n\u221a\ns = 1.8 TeV.\n34\nUncertainty in u quark distribution (\u03b1\ns\n fixed)\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1\nx\nRatio MRST(TEVP*,Q*,R*,S*)\/MRST2001\nfor u quark at Q2 = 10 GeV2\nP*\nQ*\nR*\nS*\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1\nx\nRatio MRST(TEVP*,Q*,R*,S*)\/MRST2001\nfor u quark at Q2 = 104 GeV2\nUncertainty in gluon distribution (\u03b1\ns\n fixed)\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1x\nRatio MRST(TEV P*,Q*,R*,S* )\/MRST2001\nfor gluon at Q2 = 10 GeV2\nP*\nQ*\nR*\nS*\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1x\nRatio MRST(TEV P*,Q*,R*,S*)\/MRST2001\nfor gluon at Q2 = 104 GeV2\nFigure 10: The up quark and gluon distributions at Q2 = 10 and 104 GeV2 found in the extrema\nglobal fits on the \u2206\u03c72 = 50 contour of the \u03c3W,H(Tevatron) plot of Fig. 9 with \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) fixed at\n0.119.\n35\nUncertainty in u quark distribution (\u03b1\ns\n free)\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1\nx\nRatio MRST(TEV P,Q,R,S)\/MRST2001\nfor u quark at Q2 = 10 GeV2\nP\nQ\nR\nS\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1\nx\nRatio MRST(TEV P,Q,R,S)\/MRST2001\nfor u quark at Q2 = 104 GeV2\nUncertainty in gluon distribution (\u03b1\ns\n free)\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1x\nRatio MRST(TEV P,Q,R,S)\/MRST2001\nfor gluon at Q2 = 10 GeV2\nPQ\nR\nS\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1x\nRatio MRST(TEV P,Q,R,S)\/MRST2001\nfor gluon at Q2 = 104 GeV2\nFigure 11: As for Fig. 10 but with \u03b1S(M\n2\nZ) allowed to vary.\n36\nVariation of \u03c3(W-)\/\u03c3(W+) about MRST2001 value of 0.749\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3\nPer cent change in \u03c3(W-)\/\u03c3(W+)\n\u2206\u03c72\nFigure 12: The variation of \u03c72 obtained by performing global fits with \u03c3(W\u2212)\/\u03c3(W+) fixed at\ndifferent values in the neighbourhood of the value obtained in the unconstrained MRST2001\nfit.
