This  has  been  accompanied  by  the  growth  of\nguidelines, and frameworks aiming to provide educational and assessment structures.\nThe article explores three research questions:\n1. What does \u2018enterprise\u2019 mean in the context of 14-19 education?\n2.  What  is  the  purpose  and  contribution  of   competence   frameworks   and   related\nstructures for the learning and assessment of enterprise education?  How  effective  are\nthey?\n3. How  might  enterprise  education  frameworks  evolve  in  response  to  changes  in  the  post-\nrecessionary economic, employment and educational landscape?\nIt discusses theories, policies  and  practices  relating  to  enterprise  education  in  the  English  secondary\nschool sector,  contributing  new  ideas  on  enterprise  education  at  an  important  time.  It  examines  the\nliterature surrounding enterprise education and reviews a range of competency  frameworks  introduced  to\nassist enterprise education for the 14-19 age group.\nThese are compared using discourse analysis of their educational rationale (\u2018why?\u2019), ontology  and  content\n(\u2018what enterprise skills and  knowledge  they  include\u2019),  pedagogy  of  teaching,  learning  and  assessment\n(\u2018how can enterprise be learned?\u2019) and philosophy (how does enterprise benefit the learner?).\nCritical Literature Review\nThe literature on  enterprise  education  in  schools  comprises  research  papers,   government  and  policy\nreports covering educational practice over two decades. This scholarship is summarised in Table 1.\nTable 1: Review of the Enterprise Education Literature summarising key ideas\n|Name, Date            |Enterprise Education Concepts                                            |\n|Johnson, 1988         |Enterprise education aims to develop wider business competences for self |\n|                      |employment, employment or outside conventional jobs                      |\n|Caird, 1989-93        |Proposes research to understand what it means to be enterprising and its |\n|                      |links to entrepreneurship.

An   early\ndefinition of enterprise competency was:\n\u2018Enterprise competencies consist of knowledge (about the specific  project  or  business),  specific  projects\nskills and general capability; that is, the ability or predisposition to set up and run  projects\u2019  (Johnson  1988\nin Caird 1992 p7).\nThis was grounded in the discourse of business start-up, favoured by universities and business,  but  many\ntraining agencies and  schools  developed  more  broadly-based  competencies  and  \u2018soft\u2019  skills;  personal\nattributes linked to  career  development  and  work  relationships,  fitting  a  broader  range  of  educational\nagendas (Garavan et al. 1995).\nThese variants contribute to the ontological confusion surrounding enterprise as: either a set of either  \u2018soft\u2019\ninterpersonal skills (Davies, 2002) or functional entrepreneurship (WEF report, 2009). The term  \u2018enterprise\ncompetency\u2019 operationalises these approaches into  assessable  curricula  for  implementation  in  schools.\nCaird (1992) categorised the range of \u2018enterprise\u2019 skills into seven groups, noting the breadth of skills,  lack\nof specificity and rationale for the concept of enterprise competency.\n\u2022 Personality Variables\n\u2022 Communication Skills\n\u2022 Managerial Skills\n\u2022 Analytical Skills\n\u2022 Career Skills\n\u2022 Knowledge\n\u2022 Attitudes\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR)  in  \u2018The  Entrepreneurial  Society\u2019  (1998),  arguing  for  the\nintroduction of enterprise and entrepreneurship into school and Higher Education  curricula,  based  on  the\nperceived importance of enterprise in education for the development of the UK economy. This advocated a\npractical \u2018Young Enterprise\u2019 (YE) approach using simulated experiences of starting and running businesses\nto develop young people\u2019s business and \u2018softer\u2019 skills.\n\u2022 Practical Business Experience\n\u2022 Team Working\n\u2022 Problem Solving and Negotiation\n\u2022 Communication of Ideas\n\u2022 Enterprise Skills\n\u2022 Planning and Presenting\nAcademics have worked to clarify understanding of the blurred  boundaries  between  enterprise  education\nand work  related  learning  (Dwerryhouse,  2001),  action  learning  (Revans,  1991),  experiential  learning\n(Kolb, 1984) and entrepreneurial learning (Rae, 2000).  Alan Gibb, (1993, 1997, 1999) one of the  foremost\ncontributors,  consistently argued for an holistic understanding of enterprise education with  an  explicit  set\nof enterprising behaviours, skills and attributes (Gibb, 2008), and a learning  environment  which  simulated\nthe small business based  on  an  andragogical  rather  than  pedagogical  approach  to  learning.  He  also\nemphasised a deep-rooted cultural conflict between control-centred and enterprising learning.\nThere is an orthodoxy that enterprise education  should  adopt  the  entrepreneurial  process  as  a  starting\npoint (Gibb 1993, Gibb and Cotton, 1998), using  action  learning  to  deliver  curricula  (Leitch  &  Harrison,\n1999; Jack & Anderson 1999; Fiet,  2000,  Jones  &  English  2004).  These  approaches  encapsulate  the\npedagogical debate:  is  enterprise  best  taught  or  learned?  How  effective  is  a  curricular,  teaching-led\napproach in  comparison  with  an  enterprising  approach  to  learning  through  exploration  and  discovery\nlearning in conditions of controlled risk and uncertainty?\nIn  2001  the  CEI  launched  the  first  national  investigation  into  enterprise  education,   concluding   that\nenterprise was a confused field without distinct understanding and lacking in academic  research,  with  few\npeople other than Gibb making a useful contribution to  the  field  of  either  enterprise  or  entrepreneurship\neducation.  Specific agencies such as YE, Prince\u2019s Trust and NatWest commissioned  studies  to  evaluate\ntheir programmes (Hayward, 2000; Shutt, Sutherland and Koutsoukos, 2001;  MORI,  2001,  Schagen  and\nMacdonald, 1998; Horne 2000).\nThe Davies Report (2002) followed the CEI investigation, based on a review  of  17  schools  which  offered\nsome form of enterprise education, arguing the case for enterprise education as a  driver  in  improving  the\neconomy, and defining enterprise competency as:\n\u2018The ability to handle uncertainty and respond positively to change, to create and implement new ideas and\nnew ways of doing things,  to  make  reasonable  risk\/reward  assessments  and  act  upon  them  in  one\u2019s\npersonal and working life.\u2019 (Davies 2002, p18).\nIt specified knowledge and understanding of concepts; skills; attitudes;  financial literacy; and economic\nand business understanding.  The key elements of the report are summarised in Table 2. The Davies\nreport provided workable definitions, but while the concepts of financial literacy and economic and\nbusiness understanding added breadth to enterprise; the knowledge, skills and attitudes presented were\nlittle different from those of twelve years earlier, retaining their tensions and ontological confusion.\nTable 2: Key Themes in the Davies Report 2002\n|Page     |Theme                                                                                  |\n|Number   |                                                                                       |\n|21       |Enterprise situated within Economic and Industrial understanding and Work Related      |\n|         |Learning.                                                                              |\n|25       |The possibility of enterprise \u201cbeing lost\u201d within citizenship specifically Personal,   |\n|         |Social and Health Education (PSHE) which also delivers financial and economic          |\n|         |understanding.                                                                         |\n|27       |The limited experience of teachers in delivering enterprise education.                 |\n|30       |Children regard business people and entrepreneurs as generally positive role models.   |\n|36       |Confusion and lack of agreed definitions limit the ability of schools, brokers and     |\n|         |businesses to work together.                                                           |\n|36       |Little systematic, national monitoring of enterprise education                         |\n|37       |Schools are overloaded with initiatives and need to be convinced of the effectiveness  |\n|         |of engaging in other activities                                                        |\n|38       |DfES must provide  \u2018Clear guidance which explains what is meant by enterprise          |\n|         |education\u2019                                                                             |\n|40       |Richest learning opportunities are offered by mini company schemes or community        |\n|         |projects                                                                               |\n|51       |Teachers need professional development of enterprise and industry knowledge and        |\n|         |practice                                                                               |\n|53       |Need to improve levels of business engagement in education                             |\n|56       |Need for better evaluation                                                             |\nThe foregoing summary of literature suggests a confused agenda,  fraught with tensions between ontology,\npedagogy and assessment. The voices of educators in the school sector and of  students  are  significantly\nabsent in a discourse dominated by political ideology and  educational  policy  guidelines  and  frameworks,\naddressed in the next section.\nPolicy Literature\nThere is a growing literature of official international publications focusing on enterprise and  entrepreneurial\neducation in the secondary sector (Gibb, 2008; Wilson and Mariotti,  2009).  In  the  USA  entrepreneurship\nhas been seen as the key driver of economic growth,  (Wilson  and  Mariotti,  2009)  and  education  policy,\nsupported  by  business,  has  been  shaped  to  meet  these  demands.  In  Europe  the   picture   is   more\ncomplicated, and the topic has been the subject of extensive debate (European Commission 2002,  2006a,\n2006b, 2006c) with countries such as Norway and Austria focussing on entrepreneurial development  while\nFinland, for example, has chosen to pursue a national strategy centred on life skills and employability at  all\nlevels of education (McLarty et. al., 2010), to enhance an  entrepreneurial  spirit  make  entrepreneurship  a\nmore attractive career choice. Finland is exceptional, generally entrepreneurship education and  training  in\nschools internationally has received  low  ratings  every  year  since  expert  surveys  commenced  in  2000\n(Martinez et al., 2010 p16), reflecting its priority in national educational policies.\nIn 2004 Hytti and O\u2019Gorman reviewed 50 enterprise education programmes over four countries. They\nargued that the definition of enterprise education was less important than the understanding of enterprise\nas a subject which encompasses elements of business and entrepreneurship but which requires training of\nspecialist staff. One possible way to provide a clear definition of enterprise ontology coupled with pedagogy\nand assessable competencies was presented by the US based Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship\n(NFTE) in its 2009 report for the Word Economic Forum (WEF): \u2018Educating the Next Wave of\nEntrepreneurs.\u2019 It presents 12 \u2018competencies\u2019 that every young person should learn about before leaving\nsecondary education (p31). These  are rooted in the ideology of US, capitalist, free-enterprise, involving\nboth formal and informal education systems, teachers, families and entrepreneurs; using the latest\ntechnology with real scenarios and experiences. This approach develops cognitive change with both theory\nand practice.\nThe UK, and Ireland, have distinctive national strategies for enterprise education in focussing  on  a  broad,\nskills-based definition of  enterprising  behaviour,  applicable  not  only  to  business  venturing  but  also  to\nincreasing employability (Davies, 2002; McLarty et. al., 2010). This has influenced changes  in  policy  at  a\nEuropean  level,  which  have  seen  the  rationale  for  enterprise  education  shift   from   the   creation   of\nemployment  via  entrepreneurship  to  the  improvement  of  international   competitiveness,   through   the\ndevelopment of a skilled workforce, and an \u2018innovation driven\u2019 approach to enterprise teaching and learning\n(Lisbon Agenda, 2000; Martinez et al., 2010). This is reflected  in  the  UK\u2019s  educational  policy  which  has\nmoved from the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative in 1982, through the Education Reform Act in\n1988 and  business engagement through the Education Business Partnerships (EBP\u2019s in 1992 to focus  on\ncreating a more flexible, creative, opportunity seeking and  free  thinking  workforce  (Gibb,  2008).  This  is\nevidenced by  the  introduction  of  Personal,  Social,  Health  and  Economic  (PSHE)  in  2000,  vocational\nGCSEs in 2001,  Personal, Learning and Thinking Skills (PLTS) in 2007 and new Diplomas in 2009.\nHowever, competing educational initiatives have  bedevilled  implementation  of  the  policy,  not  its  ethos.\nFollowing the Davies Report, the government made it mandatory from 2005 for every student in Key  Stage\n4 to receive the equivalent of five days of enterprise education per year, and committed \u00a3275 million  to the\ndevelopment of enterprise education between 2005 \u2013 2011, the majority being given directly to  schools  as\nnon-ring-fenced funding.\nIn  preparation,  the  Centre  for  Education  and   Industry   at   Warwick   University   (CEI)   assumed   the\nmanagement of 151 \u2018pathfinder\u2019 projects across \u2018400 schools over  two  years  (Ofsted,  2004)  to  evaluate\npotential methodologies for  delivering  enterprise  education.  This  led  to  the  development  of  enterprise\neducation material on the \u2018teachernet\u2019 website, compiled by CEI to offer guidance and case studies to  help\nschools develop programmes for enterprise education.\nTwo  advisory  bodies  support  the  development  of  enterprise  education:  the   Specialist   Schools   and\nAcademies Trust (SSAT)  who  oversee  the  Enterprise  Learning  Partnerships  (ELP\u2019s);  and  Ofsted,  the\nschools\u2019 inspectorate. There is almost no research available on the impact of  the  ELP  network  making  it\ndifficult to assess how it has contributed to the field, other than acting as  a  secondary  funding  body,  and\nthere is little evidence  that  the  ELPs  have  played  a  significant  role  in  the  development  of  enterprise\neducation (McLarty et. al., 2010). Ofsted inspect  enterprise  as  part  of  institutional,   subject  and  survey\ninspections. These assess the shared understanding of  enterprise;  learning  outcomes  and  assessment;\nprovision for all students;  evidence  of  achievement;  and  management  of  enterprise  education.  Ofsted\nreports on this topic (2004, 2005 and 2007) have found a lack of consistency in the planning,  delivery  and\nassessment of enterprise education.\nOther than the minimum requirement of engagement hours and the online guidance, there  have  not  been\nexplicit policy guidelines for schools on enterprise education, its application or  monitoring,  and  it  appears\nas an  element  in  other  agendas  and  policies,  as  one  of  six  cross-dimensional  themes  in  the  wider\ncurriculum (QCA, 2009) which is not of core  interest  to  the  schools  inspectorate.  The  recent  review  of\nenterprise  education  in  schools  shows  very  little  progress  in  the  field  (McLarty   et.   al.,   2010)   and\nrecommends  updating  guidance  on  the  implementation   and   assessment   of   enterprise   educational\nstrategies, improving local networks, and reviewing the role of Ofsted  in  assessing  provision.  Wales  and\nEngland have a similar policy ethos, however in Wales there is a national Youth Enterprise Strategy  which\nprovides central guidance and resources, subject specialists  in  every  institution  and  integration  into  the\nnational inspection  framework;   Wales  is  commended  as  a  leader  in  enterprise  education  in  Europe\n(McLarty et. al., 2010).\nIn conclusion, the policy literature presents  little  more  definitive  guidance  on  enterprise  than  academic\nresearch, it is also very diverse, with many contributors and requirements for enterprise education  to  fulfil.\nIt  highlights that the policy  ethos  and  its  ideology  is  less  to  blame  for  the  confusion  over  enterprise\neducation in England than the implementation of policy which has failed to embed enterprise at the heart of\nthe curriculum.\nHaving established an overview of the academic and policy literature,  we move to review  current  practice\nin relation to two essential questions:\n\u2022 What does \u2018enterprise\u2019 mean in the context of 14-19 education?\n\u2022 What is the purpose and contribution of competence  frameworks  and  related  structures\nfor the learning and assessment of enterprise education? How effective are they  in  enabling\nstudent learning?\nResearch Method \nThe research consisted of desk research on the academic and  policy  debates;   and  data  collection  of  a\nselection  of  enterprise  competence  frameworks.   These  aim  to  provide  educational  and  assessment\nstructures for enterprise learning and have seen increasing use since the formal introduction  of  enterprise\neducation in 2005. The reviewing aims to reveal whether enterprise education has developed  a  distinctive\npedagogy which can be assessed for educational impact.\nThirty organisations who had produced local frameworks for  provision  of  enterprise  education,  definition\nand assessment were approached. These included Local Enterprise Grant Initiatives  (LEGI),  schools  and\ncolleges, enterprise education companies and Local Education  Authorities  (LEA\u2019s).  They  were  asked  to\nshare their competency frameworks of lists of skills for enterprise education,  or  other  literature  specifying\nthe enterprise skills their work aimed to develop. Other publicly available  frameworks  including  the  Small\nFirms Enterprise Development Initiative (SFEDI) and the Institute for  Leadership  and  Management  (ILM)\naward in preparing for business enterprise were included.\nFewer than one in three organisations responded  and  ten  different  frameworks  were  collected  in  total.\nHowever, these are reasonably representative of current practice.  A  comparison  of  the  frameworks  was\nconducted,  using  narrative  analysis,  based  on  the  concept  of  phrase  families,  to  identify   points   of\nconsonance and difference.  The  use  of  phrase  families  stems  from  the  principle  that  many  of  these\nframeworks use linguistic terms to convey  similar  or  closely  related  ideas,  such  as  skills  which,  whilst\nsemantically different can be taken to represent very similar concepts, literally or ontologically, as shown  in\nthe example of teamwork presented in Figure 1. Sixteen phrase families were developed from the  analysis\nof the frameworks.\nIt  was  evident  in  most  cases  there  was  little  semantic  difference  between  most  of  the  skills  in  the\nframeworks; the differences tending to be in how the skills were grouped into categories. To  illustrate  this,\nthe frameworks were shown in a grid (Appendix Table 1) using the 16 phrase families, using the longest list\nof competencies from Blackpool and comparing them with each other. They were also  compared  with  the\nDavies,   Network   for   Teaching   Entrepreneurship   (NFTE),   Small    Firms    Enterprise    Development\nInitiative (SFEDI) PE1 Standards and the Institute for Leadership  and  Management  (ILM)  Level  2\/GCSE\nQualification in Preparing for Business Enterprise sets of skills. Those \u2018orphan\u2019  skills  which  had  no  direct\nmatch across the frameworks were included in Appendix Table 2 to allow for comparison. The next  section\ndiscusses these findings in detail.\nFigure 1: Teamwork Phrase Family\n[1]\nFindings\nThe first conclusion is that, whilst the terminology varies across the frameworks, in almost all cases there is\na direct link to some but not all, of the skills identified in the Davies and CEI reports; this results in  most  of\nthe  frameworks  presenting  competencies  which   are   \u2018soft\u2019   skills-based,   with   connections   to   other\neducational agendas such as PLTS, PSHE or WRL, as noted by the Davies report in (2002:21-25).\nThe term \u2018team\u2019 for example appears in all of the frameworks, it is also a  skill  explicit  in  PLTS,  implicit  in\nPSHE  and an explicit element (through enterprise) of the WRL education policy (2009).\nThis can be made more  apparent  by  focusing  on  PLTS  which  has  in  recent  years  grown  to  become\nsynonymous with enterprise  teaching  and  learning.  Table  3  below  shows  the  PLTS  skill  groups  with\nexamples of skills selected from some of the frameworks in this area.\nTable 3: A Comparison of PLTS Skills and Enterprise Competencies\n|PLTS Skill Group                            |Enterprise Competencies & agencies          |\n|Independent enquirers                       |Using initiative \u2013 Blackpool                |\n|                                            |Independent \u2013 No Limits                     |\n|                                            |Initiative \u2013 Rotherham                      |\n|Creative thinkers                           |Generating ideas and innovating \u2013 Blackpool |\n|                                            |Creativity and Innovation \u2013 Rotherham       |\n|                                            |Coming up with ideas \u2013 Bright Sparks        |\n|Reflective learners                         |Setting targets and goals \u2013 Blackpool       |\n|                                            |Developing and evaluating proposals \u2013       |\n|                                            |Grimsby                                     |\n|                                            |Set Goals \u2013 No Limits                       |\n|Team workers                                |Working within a team \u2013 Bright Sparks       |\n|                                            |Working effectively with others \u2013 Grimsby   |\n|                                            |Team player \u2013 No Limits                     |\n|Self-managers                               |Managing Money and... \u2013 Blackpool           |\n|                                            |Plan and Manage \u2013 No Limits                 |\n|                                            |Organising and Planning \u2013 Rotherham         |\n|Effective participants.                     |Making the right choices for customers \/    |\n|                                            |clients \u2013 Grimsby                           |\n|                                            |Weighing up the situation \u2013 Bright Sparks   |\n|                                            |Interprets and communicates information \u2013   |\n|                                            |Learning and Skills DA (NI)                 |\nThis analysis of  the  relationship  between  enterprise  and  other  agendas  supports  our  conclusion  that\nenterprise education is focussed primarily on the delivery  of  soft  skills,  raising  the  question:  what  does\n\u2018enterprise\u2019 mean in the context of 14-19 education? Is there a distinct ontology or  an  osmosis  with  other\neducational agendas?\nThe ten frameworks all  refer  to  some  form  of  teamworking  and  communication,  most  to  creativity  or\nproblem solving, as well as management and risk taking, and almost all address some form of independent\ninquiry. However, in most cases these skills do not relate explicitly to  SFEDI  or  the  NFTE  competences,\nand neither team-working nor communication, which  are  the  only  commonalities  between  the  collected\ndata, appear in the SFEDI, NFTE or ILM frameworks.\nOnly four frameworks view managing money as a key skill, and only three hold any form of wider business,\neconomic or enterprise awareness as important, even though these  are  highlighted  as  key  elements  by\nDavies. This makes it apparent that in terms of skills, although there is heterogeneity in the language used,\nthey tend to avoid the commercial distinctiveness of business-oriented enterprise is concerned.\nThe frameworks differ in the range of skills and competencies included:  16  skills  from  Blackpool  and   in\nYork. Given this variation, how can they be consistent and effective as the basis  for  educational  practice?\nMuch is dependent on  the  interpretation  by  teachers,  because  the  wide  range  of  \u2018soft  skills\u2019  are  not\nontologically distinct, and can be delivered through a range of pedagogies (\u2018how\u2019). This trends  is  repeated\nin Appendix 2, where  the  skillsets  become  more  individualised  to  their  respective  products  and  more\nesoteric; there are some, limited, linkages to SFEDI, ILM and Davies and no direct links to the NFTE work.\nAn educator could reasonably ask if any of these frameworks  present  the  definitive  list  of  competencies\nand look to the literature for guidance; Davies and the CEI\u2019s view would support almost any of  the  options\npresented;  Caird\u2019s  1992  work  would  broadly  cover  a  range  of  skills  being  classed  within  enterprise\ncompetency but not in a way  which  would  provide  helpful  guidance  to  aid  choice,  as  would:  Johnson\n(1988) and Hynes (1996); while Gibb\u2019s  (1987,  1993,  1998)  work  take  a  more  entrepreneurial  direction\ntowards enterprise education, as do Rae (2003) and Jones (2006),   which  might  have  more  in  common\nwith SFEDI and NFTE, and less with the frameworks this paper has examined.\nIf they asked which frameworks have most benefit  for  students,  the  data  to  assess  this  does  not  exist\nbecause assessing enterprise is driven  by  institutional  competency  (Ofsted  \/  CEI)  not  student  impact.\nSince the types of enterprise skills that most of these frameworks assess  are  not  ontologically  unique,  a\nstudent could become a better communicator  through  enterprise  education  or  by  changing  a  group  of\nfriends  and  experiencing  different  social  interactions;  because  of  the  drive  to  embed  enterprise  into\nagendas such as PLTS and WRL, a discrete pedagogy is elusive.\nMost enterprise education projects have undertaken some  form  of  evaluation,   but  few  have  conducted\nimpact research; an exception is YE,  whose  2009  Alumni  Survey  showed  that  by  comparison  to  their\npeers, previous students engaged in YE achieved better job and career prospects. Perhaps the IPPR were\nright in 1998 when  they  suggested  that  practical  entrepreneurship  programmes  may  provide  the  best\nopportunities to develop enterprise education. Those competencies are used by the NFTE and SFEDI,  but\ndo not feature widely in the collected data.\nThe role of these frameworks may be  questioned,  as  if  they  do  not  define  what  enterprise  education\nshould be, and educators cannot choose the \u2018best\u2019 framework, what useful role do they  play  in  secondary\neducation? An answer may be found in the distinction made by  Gibb  (1987;  1996;  2002)  of  the  cultural\ndivide between entrepreneurial small  business  and  bureaucratic-corporate  thinking;  the  latter  pervades\neducational bureaucracy in England.\nTable 4 illustrates the cultural differences between Bureaucratic (Government \/ Educational) concerns  and\nthe  characteristics  of  Entrepreneurial  \/  Enterprising  people.  It  is  appears  from  our  analysis  that  the\ncompetency frameworks exemplify a corporate-bureaucratic mindset which seeks to standardise, prescribe\nand control what is taught and learned. There is a danger it  may  strangle  the  creativity,  spontaneity  and\nflexibility  which  is  at  the  heart  of  the  enterprise  experience.  This  point  is  not  new,  since  Gibb  has\nemphasised it in his writings over more than twenty years, but it  is  nonetheless  still  valid.  Penaluna  and\nPenaluna  (2009)  also  support  this  point,  observing  that  \u2018not  much  has   changed\u2019   in   terms   of   the\ndevelopment of creative approaches in education. Viewed in  this  manner  it  is  evident  that  the  norming\ninstinct of educational policy is to seek to impose through a  prescribed  curriculum  rules,  order,  planning:\nframeworks which break like waves against enterprise education which  is  inherently  untidy,  informal  and\ndeeply intuitive.\nEnterprise competency frameworks exist as means of operationalising and assessment of skills  which\nare by their nature difficult to assess. Given the proliferation of these frameworks it must be suggested  that\nthere is a danger that the need to evidence and to assess takes precedence over the enterprising nature of\nthe learning experience, but their lack of consistency means they do not achieve this  very  efficiently.  This\ncauses  educators  real  difficulties  practitioners;  trying  to  educate   people   to   be   enterprising   needs\napproaches which go beyond two-dimensional frameworks and skillsets which  are  required  to  be  clearly\ndefined, unique and assessable at set curricular and key  stage  levels.   If  educational  policy  had  trusted\neducators to enable students to use their  imagination,  creativity  and  flexibility,  it  would  require  training,\nguidance and support  rather  than  prescription.  The  most  influential  enterprise  educators  work  with  a\nflexibility and freedom which enables student learning through guiding the process, not  by  prescribing  the\noutcome, as described for example by Penaluna & Penaluna (2009) and Jones (2009).\nTable 4: Gibb\u2019s Cultural Divide (Gibb, 2002)\n|The Bureaucratic \u2013 Corporate \u2013 Entrepreneurial Dilemma        |\n|Government \/ Educational Focus|Entrepreneurial \/ Enterprising|\n|wants:                        |people are:                   |\n|Order                         |Untidy                        |\n|Formality                     |Informal                      |\n|Accountability                |Trusting                      |\n|Information                   |Personality observing         |\n|Clear demarcation             |Overlapping                   |\n|Planning                      |Intuitive                     |\n|Corporate strategy            |Tactically strategic          |\n|Control measures              |Personally led                |\n|Formal standards              |Personally observed           |\n|Transparency                  |Ambiguous                     |\n|Functional Expertise          |Holistic                      |\n|Systems                       |Reliant on \u2018feel\u2019             |\n|Positional Authority          |Owner managed                 |\n|Formal Performance            |Customer \/ network exposed    |\n|Appraisal                     |                              |\nThe next section provides a structured discussion which addresses the research  questions  in  the  altered\ncontext of the significant economic and political changes which are evolving, to provide a starting  point  for\na new approach to enterprise in schools. \nDiscussion\n1. What does \u2018enterprise\u2019 mean in the context of 14-19 education?\nIt is proposed that enterprise has been \u2018hijacked\u2019 by schools as a convenient vehicle for them to evidence a\nrange of \u2018soft\u2019 skills which they cannot easily do in other ways. In some schools it is even   the  practice  for\n\u2018less academic\u2019 or \u2018challenging\u2019 students to be directed towards enterprise, whilst academic \u2018high fliers\u2019  are\nsteered towards attainment of qualifications which improve  school  league-table  performance.   Whilst  we\nwould hope that students who may be marginalised by their educational experiences may be energised  by\nenterprising learning, it does seem wrong to steer \u2018the  more  able\u2019  away  from  enterprise,  for,  as  argued\nbelow, they are as likely to need to be enterprising in their lives and careers.\nIt  seems  that  the  rationale  and  philosophy  of  enterprise  is  poorly  articulated  and  understood  in  the\neducational policy literature: is it free-market political ideology, the development of  soft  skills  or  PLTS  by\nanother name, or the development of employable  young  people?  Some  of  these  positions  would  raise\nideological and other difficulties for many educators.\nEnterprise is about developing a mindset, goals (self-efficacy)  and  skills  (personal  capabilities)  to  equip\nyoung people for their futures. Enterprising learning is the process of learning in enterprising ways  as  well\nas becoming enterprising. It is conative and affective as well as  cognitive  (Gibb,  2006),  but  education  is\noften most comfortable in the safety of cognitive learning.\nOur view is  that  enterprise,  in  the  context  of  secondary  education  (and  beyond),  can  be  defined  as\npersonal, situational, and economic:\n\u2022 Personal: the development of self-knowledge and self-efficacy to be  able  to  investigate,\ndevelop and act on ideas and opportunities.\n\u2022 Situational: being enterprising is contingent on  subjects  and  situations,  hence  learning\nand acting in enterprising ways will be different in, for example, performing arts, biological\nsciences, or mathematics; yet there is a role for enterprising learning  in  all  of  these,  as\nthere is in,  or  between,  all  subjects.  Enterprise  is  also  concerned  with  the  practical\napplications  of  taught  subjects,  and  can  be  usefully  described   as   \u2018practical   creativity\u2019,\nespecially in situations where the term \u2018enterprise\u2019 is considered too value-laden.\n\u2022 Economic: an outcome of enterprise is the creation of new  value.  That  should  be  wider  than\nsimply financial value  or  the  generation  of  personal  profit,  and  include  social,  environmental,\naesthetic and intellectual value which may be shared in a range of ways. Students have to survive\nin an economic world and an understanding of responsible enterprise should assist them in this.\n2. What is the purpose and contribution of  competence  frameworks  and  related  structures  for  the\nlearning and assessment of enterprise education? How effective are these frameworks in  enabling\nstudent learning?\nWe do not argue for the abolition of competence frameworks and  the  like,  simply  that  they  be  regarded\neducationally as maps rather than  manuals;  that  is,  they  can  usefully  create  an  understanding  of  the\nlandscape of enterprise and  the  human  capabilities  which  are  found  in  it.  But  some  maps  are  more\naccurate and reliable than  others,  and  some  of  the  frameworks  reviewed  should  not  be  regarded  as\naccurate or complete templates for enterprise skills. To understand a landscape one needs to go  exploring\nor   orienteering  in  it;  with  the  risks  of  getting  lost,  bogged  down,  muddy  but  eventually  finding   the\ndestination (Penaluna et al, 2008). The journey,  or  process,  is  as  important  as  the  prescribed  learning\noutcome.  Conditions  of  risk,  uncertainty  of  outcome  and  possible  failure  are  inevitable  and   actually\ndesirable in the enterprising learning experience.\nThe best enterprise educators work more as guides and coaches  rather  than  experts  or  conventional\nteachers. Their practice is different from the orthodoxy  of  14-19  education,  yet  not  incompatible  with  it.\nTheir  students  get  their  hands  dirty  and  have  fun.  They  learn  by  experimenting,  doing,  discovering\nunexpected  outcomes.  Teachers  need  professional  development,  trust,  and  the   space   to   construct\npersonal praxis and passion for enterprise. That will  not  be  preferred  by  all,  and  slavish  attention  to  a\ncompetence framework and assessment evidence is not the way to achieve it.\nEnterprise needs to become an academically distinctive  field,  connected  with  practical  entrepreneurship\nand organisations such as SFEDI  and  the  NFTE.  It  is  not  simply  the  soft  skills  of  PLTS  revisited;  a\ncoherent progression from enterprising learning is the application of this knowledge to  innovation,  venture\ncreation, and the practise of small business skills in the workplace or marketplace. Enterprise is a  stage  of\nentrepreneurial development, as being an entrepreneur is a transitional, not fixed identity (a point missed in\nthe  lazy  educational  use  of  stereotypical  media  such  as  \u2018The   Apprentice\u2019   and   \u2018Dragons   Den\u2019   as\nrepresentations  of  \u2018reality\u2019).  Being  enterprising  is  a  way  of  being  and  working,  it  is  contextual,   and\nentrepreneurship is one highly developed example of this.\n3. How might enterprise education and such frameworks evolve in the light of  major  changes  in  the\neconomic, employment and educational landscape of post 2008?\nWe can argue that the financial and banking crisis of 2007-8, the recession, the economic and employment\nconsequences for society in general and young people in particular, and the political changes following  the\nUK General Election must cause us to rethink the  role  of  enterprise  in  the  curriculum  and  the  way  we\napproach it. It is not too extreme  to  say  that  enterprise  educators  face  the  greatest  challenge  of  their\ngeneration  in  enabling  school-leavers  and  graduates  to  start  their  working  lives  in  a   post-recession\neconomy with increasing unemployment for young people (Rae, 2009).\nThere is a need for enterprise education to prepare young people with the new skills and ability to  confront\nthis new era; the questions is, as currently defined and taught, will it be able to achieve this?  There is  also\na need for enterprise education to confront  its  ideological  context.  It  was  the  beneficiary  of  substantial\nfunding from the Labour administration, directly sanctioned by Gordon Brown for some  twelve  years.  The\nnew government also  has  enthusiastic  rhetoric  about  local  enterprise  rebalancing  the  economy.  How\nindependent of political ideology can enterprise be?\nAs the economy, society and expectations of education change, enterprise should become an intrinsic  part\nof the survival skills which young people need to be able to build their lives and portfolio careers in this new\nera, through flexibility, diversity and lifelong learning. There is a need  to  change  the  view  that  enterprise\neducation and highly assessed soft skills, as they are  currently  defined,  are  sufficient  to  prepare  young\npeople for the post-recessionary economy. A narrow  reading  of  profit-centred  entrepreneurship  alone  is\nalso be insufficient and an explicit grounding in social and community based  enterprise  is  required,  being\npresent in some enterprise teaching but not fully understood or evident in all.\nConclusion: A proposed new approach to enterprise education\nEnterprise  education  can  be  seen  as  simply  a  means  of  resolving  the  long-standing   gap   between\neducation, at different levels, and the  \u2018world  of  work\u2019  of  the  \u2018real  economy\u2019.     There  have  been  many\nprevious attempts to achieve this, and the  current  confusion  in  the  definition,  research  and  practice  of\nenterprise education in schools needs to be addressed. Eight ideas are offered to facilitate  this,  based  on\nwhat has been learned through enterprise education, adapted for the new economic and political era.\nThis is not a central prescription for enterprise education, but a means of starting  to  develop  a  curriculum\nfor  enterprising  learning  in  schools  which  is  more  coherent  in  mediating   between   educational   and\neconomic requirements; more relevant to the post-recession economic and employment era;  and  likely  to\nbe more effective and meaningful for students than the very variable existing situation.\n1. Enterprise should be defined above the level of  political  and  economic  ideology,  since  equating\nenterprise with free-market capitalism is simplistic and  problematic.  Creating  new  value  through\nopportunities brings social, environmental  and  ethical  responsibilities,  which  can  be  addressed\nthrough sustainable, social and community venturing.\n2. There is  a  distinction,  which  needs  to  be  articulated  clearly,  between  enterprise  as  personal\ndevelopment,  connected  with  \u2018soft\u2019,  transferable  skills  and  entrepreneurship   as   activities   of\nopportunity and venture creation.\n3. Enterprising learning is an exploratory process, or journey, in  which  the  value  of  the  learning  is\nseen through the students experiencing and reflecting on the process, moving  from  the  academic\ninto the external world in a range of ways, physically and digitally.\n4.  Accurate  and  reliable  frameworks,  which  enable  educators  and  students  to  understand  and\nexplore enterprise, displaying a useful range of skills and attitudes, should  be  used  to  assist  the\nlearning process.\n5. Assessment, rather than being defined against outcome frameworks,  should  reflect  the  personal\nlearning and conative, affective and cognitive changes which students express, contributing to self-\ndiscovery, awareness and enhanced understanding of their world.\n6. Enterprise should be seen  as  intersubjectival,  in  which  applied  creativity,  problem-solving  and\nopportunity exploration  take  place  to  enable  students  to  transfer  and  apply  a  wide  range  of\nacademic and vocational subjects to different contexts, which can be assessed as above.\n7. This change of approach should take place through  developing  and  empowering  teachers  as\nenterprising educators; staff development  should  enable  them  to  create  learning  situations  for\nstudents, in which degrees of risk and uncertainty arise.\n8.  Evaluation  of  this  approach  to  enterprising  learning  should  take  place,  for  example  through\nprojects which combine formal and informal learning.\nThis approach to enterprising learning offers  a  distinct,  learner-centred  journey  of  exploration  and  self-\ndiscovery of \u2018who am I?\u2019 and  \u2018what  do  I  want  to  achieve?\u2019,  with  key  themes  mapped  onto  a  learning\nlandscape in which students explore conative, affective and cognitive change. It focuses on the  \u2018who,  how\nand why\u2019 as well as the \u2018what\u2019 offered by which  a  framework-driven  approach.  Being  value-  rather  than\nassessment-driven, it can demonstrate impact by changing the way young people  view  the  world  around\nthem. The policy of \u2018control\u2019  through  institutional  audit  should  shift  to  foster  development  and  creative\nlearning by training enterprise educators to work in schools. We hope  this  will  encourage  debate  among\npolicymakers, academics, practitioners and  students,  and  enable  ideas  of  practical  value  to  be  taken\nforward through experimental work with schools and practitioners.\nReferences\nButtler, D.
