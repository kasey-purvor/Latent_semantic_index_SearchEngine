In this \nreport I intend to consider first, continued debates about the framing of qualitative, and especially \nethnographic work, after the so-called crisis of representation, second, the spatialities of qualitiative \nwork and third, work in a performative vein. In setting out this path I am responding to the critique \nfrom Thrift that what is surprising about the reemergence of qualitative methods is what a \u2018narrow \nrange of skills [there] still is, how wedded [these techniques] still are to notion of bringing back the \ndata and representing nicely packaged up with illustrative quotations\u2019 and \u2018the narrow range of \nsensate life they register\u2019 (2000: 3). My aim here is not to discard all the hard won insights  so far \nbut to see whether \u2018Pushed in the appropriate direction there is no reason why these methods cannot \nbe made to dance a little.\u2019 (Latham 2003: 2000). Moreover, I want to stress that I am not making \nsome call or claim for epochal sifts in approach. Cloke, Cook et al (2004) point out that the oft told \nhistory of seeming na\u00efve observation, ceding to formal modelling then to theoretically informed \nqualitative work is worryingly whiggish.  \n \nThinking about this critique is not to deny representation or the symbolic dimensions of societies, \nnor to celebrate the non-cognitive as somehow more authentic. I am not suggesting that we can \nsimply access the prelinguistic as a way of avoiding the issues around the politics of representation. \nIndeed qualitative research is often torn between a constructivist approach and a longing to convey \na \u2018real\u2019 sense of the field. As Taussig put it \n\u2018But just as we might garner courage to reinvent a new world and live new fictions - \nwhat a sociology that would be! - so a devouring force comes at us from another \ndirection, seducing us by playing on our yearning for a true real. Would that it \nwould, would that it could, come clean this true real. I so badly want that wink of \nrecognition, that complicity with the nature of nature. But the more I want it the \nmore I realize it's not for me. Not for you either... which leaves us this silly and often \ndesperate place wanting the impossible so badly that while we believe it is our \nrightful destiny and so act as accomplices of the real, we also know in our heart of \nhearts that the way we picture the world and talk is bound to a dense set of \nrepresentational gimmicks which, to coin a phrase, have but an arbitrary relation to a \nslippery referent easing its way out of graspable sight\u2019 (1993, xvii). \n \nI wish to begin with this thorny issue of research in the wake of \u2018the crisis of representation\u2019. \n \nRepresentation, rigour and reflexivity. \n \nGeography has followed anthropology through the debates on ethnography and representation, \nresponding to Clifford\u2019s question \u2018how is unruly experience transformed into an authoritative \nwritten account?\u2019 (in Besio and Butz 2004: 433; Throop 2003). There has been a backlash against \nwhat are decried as \u2018excesses\u2019 of reflexivity in some responses to this question. For instance, \nBourdieu (2003) called for a renewed \u2018objectivity\u2019 via structural reflexivity in a participant \nobjectivation. However, with evident distaste, he clarifies lest: \n\u2018One might be misled into believing that I am referring here to the practice, made \nfashionable over a decade ago by certain anthropologists, especially on the other side \nof the Atlantic, which consists in observing oneself observing, observing the \nobserver in his work of observing or of transcribing his observations \u2026 and, last but \nnot least, on the narrative of all these experiences which lead, more often than not, to \nthe rather disheartening conclusion that all is in the final analysis nothing but \ndiscourse, text, or, worse yet, pretext for text.\u2019 (page 282). \nHis objection to this is visceral (and vicious) arguing it \u2018tends to substitute the facile delights of \nself-exploration for the methodical confrontation with the gritty realities of the field\u2019 (ibid). He \nargues for a positional understanding of reflexivity, to address the academic and social structures \nthat drive research agendas or, as McDowell put it, \u2018make visible our own critical positioning \nwithin the structure of power\u2019 (1992: 413) which for geography in non-western settings would show \nhow \u2018academic research practices\u2026 have relied extensively on remnant colonial discourses and \nstructures of domination for access to research subjects, efficacy of data collection, and \nlegitimation\u2019 (Butz and Besio 2004: 350). Bourdieu frets that textual reflexivity recreates the myth \nof the exceptional researcher set apart from their respondents not now by the clarity of their \nknowledge, but by their level of introspection, doubt and anxiety. Bourdieu suggests that \ndemystifying research practice by subjecting it to the same tools of analysis used on our topics of \nstudy. In a move echoing Latourian sociology, he thus suggests reflexivity is not marked out by \nespecially sensitive texts but is endemic and structural. \n \nAnd yet, trenchant as this may be it does not actually seem to answer the questions that \ndeconstruction poses. There clearly are issues of rhetorical structure if we look at how informant \nquotes, fieldnotes and the like are presented \u2013 for instance the evidential yet context free quote or \nthe apparently transparently described enigma that draws the reader into an explanatory game (Katz \n2001: 450). It is also true as Katz points out that \u2018in the field and in their private readings, \nethnographers share a culture of evaluation which is masked by the fractious, even righteously \nindignant commentary that characterizes rhetoric about ethnographic writing\u2019 (2002:64). We should \nnot fall back into a position where \u2018realism\u2019 and transparency are taken as unproblematic, nor \nshould we suggest that all rhetorical work conveying a sense of the real is somehow out to deceive: \n\u2018It is tempting to imagine that nothing more than manipulative rhetoric produces \ndescriptions of social life that convey a \u2018you-are- there\u2019 sense of immediacy. But if all \nthat were required was the motivation to manipulate readers, such passages would be \nmore common; it seems they are not that easy to pull off. Moreover, whatever the \ncontribution of writing style, there are, once again, good sociological reasons for the \nrhetorical effect.\u2019 (Katz 2002: 71).  \nThe creation of effects is precisely the business of writing. Local color or vignettes need not be \ncheap rhetorical tricks but might be vital to show people\u2019s crafty, idiosyncratic ways of finessing \npersistent problems (Katz 2002). Fine (2003: 45) thus argues that a detailed account of the world \nbeing observed has to be presented, as opposed to the inclusion of a few instances of data to bolster \none\u2019s analytical points, to build a case, rather than simply illuminate it. He argues that: \u2018As \nethnographers, we must do more than claim: we need to show\u2019 (Page 54). In the case of one female \ninformant, Katz argues that is only though realistic description that one can convey how \u2018The \nresources the woman finds for resistance come specifically from the very culture that oppresses her \n(2002:72). \n \nThus Butz and Besios (2004) offer an alternate reflexivity, taking Marie Louse Pratt\u2019s definition of \nautoethnography, where rather than being about reflecting on ones own practice it refers to subject \nor dominated people\u2019s self representation to colonizers in ways that engage with colonizer\u2019s terms \nwhile remaining faithful to their own self-understandings. As Pratt put it: \n\u2018Autoethnographic texts are not then, what are usually thought of as autochthonous \nor \u201cauthentic\u201d forms of self-representation \u2026 Rather they involve a selective \ncollaboration with and appropriation of idioms of the metropolis or conqueror. These \nare merged or infiltrated to varying degrees with indigenous idioms to create self-\nrepresentations intended to intervene in metropolitan modes of understanding\u2019 (in \nButz and Besios 2004: 353). \nButz, building on his earlier work discusses how he as researcher was involved with locals in \nreappropriating colonial knowledges for strategic ends making representations that will speak to \noutsiders. This trnslation is not just reframing local knowledges, Gold (2002) looks to a globalised \nreligious movement that is using its self-representations and indeed academic work in its self \nconstitution. This makes the important point of not separating ethnography from writing \u2013 not \nprivileging oral research over written material but rather seeing productions of various \nrepresentations as moments for situated reading and interpretation by all actors. And this is a two \nway process if one looks at taking research and spinning it into local idioms \u2013 and all these \ntranslations, back and forth raise further practical and important issues of mis-understandings \n(Watson 2004). If we thus move to models of representation as intervention rather than \ncorresponding to prior reality, we might look for new ways of producing and judging truth. \nKamberelis looks to the \u2018trickster\u2019 figure as someone who intervenes and acts as an individual but \nwhose performance is communal. Moreover it suggests a research accounts that are poetic, \ntransgressive, unfinalizable and transformable, where methodological syncretism is analogous to \nshape-shifter characters in non-western ways of knowing \u2013 leading to \u2018the production of open, \nnonrepresentational texts\u2019 (2003:676). \u2018Trickster and all of his\/her texts are far from \nrepresentational. Instead they are creative, dynamic, and multiple. In fact Trickster may be read as \nan almost pure embodiment of cultural creativity, dynamism and multiplicity\u2019 (ibid). This also \nsuggests qualifying our understanding of informants\u2019 knowledge. The shared assumption tended to \nbe of local knowledge and researcher ignorance \u2013 where the challenge of methods was to allow the \nresearcher to tap into that knowledge. Now although many recent accounts have pointed to \ninterviews as co-constructions of knowledge, there is still often a sense of seeking insider \nknowledge. Whereas as  James Ferguson, working in the urban Zambian copper belt puts it: \n'Here there is much to be understood, but none of the participants in the scene can \nclaim to understand it all or even take it all in. Everyone is a little confused (some more \nthan others, to be sure), and everyone finds some things that seem clear and others that \nare unintelligible or only partially intelligible... understanding must take on a different \ncharacter when to understand things like the natives is to miss most of what is going on' \n(cited in Hannerz 2003: 210) \n \nRefreshingly Besios and Butz (2004) provide their own critique of transcultural representation. \nThey point out this is not an automatic process but something that has to be worked at and may only \nbe achieved in specific circumstances. Thus Besios reflects on working with locals who do not seek \n\u2018transcultural\u2019 representation but whose struggles are local. The ability of the researcher to help \nmobilise these autoethnographies they also note is closely tied to issues of positionality in the sense \nusually subjected to reflexive analysis. This must entail more than intercultural dynamics but also \ninterpersonal ones such as sexualisation. The latter is not just the \u2018romance of the field\u2019, but can \nalso be part of the personal circumstances of research. Cupples (2002) both benefited and suffered \nfrom male respondents feigning interest in her project for sexual motives she cannot pretend her \nwork was innocent of sexualisation. Nor is this surprising since \u2018Sexuality both produces space and \npermeates social life, then the fieldwork experience is no different. A more reflexive approach to \nthe fieldwork experience and research process would necessarily include a consideration of the \nerotic dimension and the impact of the researcher\u2019s sexuality\u2019 (Cupples 2002:382; Hubbard 2002). \nWhile we might note how some aspects of identity are less malleable than other, for instance \nnotions of escaping ethnic identity are often a white fantasy (Loftsd\u00f3ttir 2002), we can also \nhighlight the multiple positionalities of researchers with multiple elements of their identity \ninteracting with locals. Researchers too are seen as embodied ordinary folk \u2013 who may be objects of \nsexual speculation, or spouses with partners present, or they may be seen as parents of children \n(neither of these latter two necessarily preventing the first) or employers of assistants or childcare \n(Cupples and Kindon 2003) renters of houses and thus sources of finance and so forth quite outwith \nthe \u2018research interaction\u2019 and these identities roll into shaping how the researcher is treated \n(DeVerteuil 2004; Magolda 2000; van Vleet 2003).  \n \nTranslocal research \n \nThis positioning of the transcultural reflects how much of our work is in places where global, \nnational and local influences mix. We find that \u2018reality and its representations become confounded \nin one another, at once both cause and effect, each inseparably a part of the phenomenology of \neveryday life in the postcolony. Thus do imported and domestic spirits infuse each other; all being \nsigns of both the local and the translocal, here and elsewhere, now and then, the concrete and the \nvirtual.\u2019 Until sites are \u2018simultaneously supralocal, translocal, and local, simultaneously planetary \nand, refracted through the shards of vernacular cultural practices, profoundly parochial.\u2019 (Comaroff \nand Comaroff 2003: 149, 151). This \u2018awkward scale\u2019 of contemporary societies means that almost \neverything occurs on a scale that does not yield easily to received methods and our \u2018subjects\u2019 no \nlonger inhabit coherent bounded social contexts for which we have a persuasive lexicon (Comaroff \nand Comaroff 2003: 152). Comaroff and Comaroff are thus led to wonder \u2018 What, in the upshot, are \nwe left with? A very stark question: Has ethnography become an impossibility? Have we finally \nreached its end?\u2019 (ibid). \n \nThe apocalyptic tones of this debate seems particular to anthropology with its habitual definition of \nfield work as residential participant observation \u2013 as oppose to the more plural practices of \nqualitative methods in geography. Anthropology\u2019s contested answer has been to allow the field to \nfragment into multi-site ethnographies. Where Hine (2000:60) suggests a new geographical \nsensitivity is utilised to move from a notion of field as bounded site to field of relations: \n\u2018Ethnographers might still start from a particular place, but would be encouraged to \nfollow connections which were made meaningful from that setting. The ethnographic \nsensitivity would focus on the ways in which particular places were made meaningful \nand visible. Ethnography in this strategy becomes as much a process of following \nconnections as it is a period of inhabitance\u2019. \nWhile this is deeply appealing, I have a slight feeling then of the \u2018emperor\u2019s new clothes\u2019 here, as \nwhen Hannerz (2004) conducts a multisite ethnography it really seems a methodologically standard \ninterview study of a specific type of informant. Perhaps paradoxically qualitative methods in \ngeography have often been locationally pluralistic but methodologically more uniform (for instance \na corporate interview based study where the interviews occur in various head offices - the details of \nwhich are often not featured in the account). Multisite ethnographies seem to retain more of a \npluralism as regards sources to include a range of 'polymorphous engagements' involving \n'interacting with informants across a number of dispersed sites, but also doing fieldwork by \ntelephone and email, collecting data eclectically in many different ways from a disparate array of \nsources' (Hannerz 2003: 212). This eclecticism has scandalized some quarters that seek to preserve \nthe \u2018rigour\u2019 of more traditional field work (Gustavson and Cytrynbaum 2003; Wogan 2004). \n \nThe question emerges as to how to reshape our techniques and representations for these multi-\nscaled, translocal places. One answer might be the literary projects of  Perec which Becker suggests \nform \u2018ethnography as generalized fiction\u2019 (2001:6). Perec\u2019s I Remember [Je me souviens] is not a \nnovel or story at all, but consists simply of 480 very short, numbered paragraphs. His aim is to list \n\u2018what people who participated in the daily, public life of the city would have seen: the buses and the \nMetro, the places where you bought food, the movie houses and other places of entertainment, the \nsports figures a young man would have been interested in.\u2019 (Becker 2001:68). In this it echoes the \nwork of Benjamin in compiling material and fragments of modern life. Alternatively to reflect the \nconflictual history and geography of field sites we might turn to Ghosh who turned his PhD into a \nnovel (1998) - placing his autobiographical persona at the center of the account and thus \nundercutting the authoritative persona he developed in his thesis by making a braided narrative, \nalternating the story of fieldwork and mediaeval slave trades, setting the 'village' in long standing \ntransnational networks (Srivastava 2001). \n \nTranslocal research also extends the field into the home and the site of interpretation. The \nchallenges here remain under discussed where we \u2018enthusiastically recount the ups and downs, the \nembarrassing \u2013 although always heroically turned to account \u2013 mishaps of research. But the many \ntwists and turns of analysis are another story\u2019 (Salzinger 2004: 6). Meth and Malaza (2003:154) \nfound that while interviews could be conducted in imagined safe \u2018halfway\u2019 locations between South \nAfrcan township, constructed as a place of fear and crime, and researcher\u2019s base, constructed as \nalien to interviewees, the transcripts of interviews on domestic violence were less easy to contain as \nthey invaded the safe space of the researcher\u2019s home with their shocking contents. Which should \nprompt us to think about where these materials are located, in the UK recent surveys suggest that \n90% of qualitative data is stored in people\u2019s homes and offices (Corti 2003: 418). This survey was \npart of an initiative to archive qualitative data raising interesting issues about how material can be \nreused by subsequent researchers without reducing the messy interactivity of field work to \u2018data\u2019. \nThe notion of qualitative material as archive should also prompt us to think more carefully about the \n\u2018analysis\u2019 and \u2018storage\u2019 of qualitative \u2018data\u2019 given all the work on the politics of knowledge in \narchives (Crang 2003).  \n \nCreative interventions \n \nThese translocal and reflexive studies raise questions about how the usual methods fit these new \nscales and topics. At one level we might start simply with different methods. Meth (2003) suggests \nthat reflective, discursive diaries firstly offer a \u2018discontinuous writing\u2019, allowing people to change \ntheir minds and priorities, meaning they are not dominated by what happened the morning before an \ninterview. Moreover they offer different and possibly easier routes for respondents to express \nthemselves, especially their emotions, and reflect upon their own world views. Alternately, Harper \n(2002) provides a history of the photo-elicitation interview where pictures push people\u2019s normal \nframes of reference to form the basis for deep discussions of values. His work combined his own \nand archival pictures with interviews to provoke multiple meanings for respondents (Harper 2003). \nIn a similar vein, a participatory video project, working with Brazilian children, used oral history \ninterviews to foster a stronger sense of collective identity, and the video became the pretext rather \nthan the main outcome (G\u00f3mez 2003: 218). Latham (2003) combined diary-interviews along with \nphotoelicitation interviews. This deep work with a small number of respondents contrasts with \nDerriu\u2019s (2003) photomontage as a way of grasping touristic \u2018souvenir Bangkok\u2019 that seems to echo \nPerec\u2019s fiction. Latham, echoing Preds\u2019 (1989) experiments, uses pictures, text and time diaries to \nconvey a sense of practising places. His writing strategy thus performs the research tactic \nKusenbach (2003) calls the \u2018go-along\u2019 \u2013 interviewing people as they stroll through their \nneighbourhoods to capture their biographies, linking places and events, their spatial practices and \nthe social architecture (cf Hyams 2003). These sorts of collages raise the question, \u2018are they any \ngood?\u2019, and by what criteria is that going to be measured? Sava and Nuutinen (2003: 522) fret that \nin the resulting \u2018controllable, mock dialogical state form surpasses content. I am more concerned \nabout how to express things than what I have to say\u2019. \n \nThe use of pictures in montage and presenting material raises the issue of how visual and verbal \nrelate to each other, whether they could speak to different ways of knowing rather than just being \ntreated as different kinds of evidence (Rose 2003). Qualitative work, even when speaking to multi-\nmethod approaches and triangulation tends to imply that these different approaches can be used in a \nbusiness as usual fashion. As O\u2019Neill et al (2002:72) note the \u2018visual in ethnographic research has \ngenerally not been used intrinsically for interpreting and representing ethnographic data and culture\u2019 \nbut either as just more data or subordinated to a textualising metaphor. The importation of post-\nstructuralism has:  \n\u2018led to the expansion of the sense of \u201ctext.\u201d The text could be construed as such \nthrough nontextual phenomena. The constraints on interpretation produced in the \nnomination of nontextual media as text focused in the main on representation. \u2026 \nPerforming bodies and images of all kinds were in principle included in literary \ndiscussions of representation, but explanatory methodologies for these extratextual \nforms were deferred. \u2026 Clearly, at least from an interdisciplinary point of view, \nsomething is lost when performances and images become texts.\u2019 (Soussloff and \nFranko 2002:33-4) \nWhatmore (2003:89-90) notes \u2018the spoken and written word constitute the primary form of \u2018data\u2019\u2019, \nwhereas the world speaks in many voices through many different types of things that \u2018refuse to be \nreinvented as univocal witnesses\u2019. Qualitative research, despite talking about the body and \nemotions, frames its enterprise in a particular way that tends to disallow other forms of knowledge. \n \nTherefore we might question how these different forms of knowledge (visual, verbal and tactile) \nrelate to each other. That there might be a non-dialogue between them is exemplified in the notion \nof interpretative \u2018interspace\u2019 developed by Sava and Nuutinen (2003) where researcher and artist \nsend each other field notes and pictures inspired by the other. Rather than a learning dialogue, they \nhighlight how each can act as echo chamber for the other, where they long to access the other side \nbut cling to the safety of their own predispositions. This comes back to the heart of Thrift\u2019s \nprogrammatic writing which is \u2018suggestive of nothing less than a drive towards a new \nmethodological avant garde that will radically refigure what it is to do research\u2019 (Latham \n2004:2000). Thrift himself has pointed to dance, perhaps over emphasising the liberatory and \nnoncognitive. In fact research through, rather than about, dance wraps the representational, haptic, \nemotional and discursive around each other. Thus as Yl\u00f6nen (2003) danced the Nicaraguan \nMaypole with \u2018Evelyn\u2019, and the latter\u2019s frankly provocative moves pushed the researcher to feel \n\u2018how thoroughly permeated by Western civilization my submissive body was\u2019 (page 559). While \nthis may seem like the common discomfort many researchers would feel in this situation, and \nmaybe just generally on the dance floor, it also suggest how knowledge is articulated with \nembodied codes and memories that \u2018emerge as flashes\u2019 not following \u2018 logical-rational knowledge\u2019 \n(page 565).  \n \nIt is normally at this point, as we engage artistic approaches, that policy oriented researchers voice \nconcerns about a turn away from commitments to engaging ordinary people and offering them \nvoice. This seems to me to be a false opposition of committed, \u2018real world\u2019 versus \u2018inaccessible\u2019, \ntheoretical research. Let us take the issues of silences and speech \u2013 where so often empowerment is \nread as giving voice, silences too can point to significant moments of resistance, both in society and \nto the process of research (Hyams 2004). For instance Mountz, Miyares et al. (2003:39) realized \nthat hostility to interviews expressed fear of immigration services and \u2018the fear and mistrust that we \nnegotiated with potential project participants was not a barrier to overcome, but rather, an \ninstructive part of the research process\u2019. While conducting participatory action research with sex \nworkers O'Neill, Giddens et al. (2002: 70) took conventional material (life story interviews) and \nrepresented it in artistic form in order to \u2018access a richer understanding of the complexities of lived \nexperience which can throw light on broader social structures and processes\u2019. Their hope was to \nopen spaces to think and feel critically \u2013 to work through the unsayable, the outside of language, the \nsensual, the non-conceptual (page 78), where audience might be left stunned by paradoxical \nmoments through which an ethnomimetic text \u2018said\u2019 the unsayable of a prostitute\u2019s experience. In \nthis way art is a way of accessing the \u2018sedimented stuff\u2019 of society that is normally hidden and \noverlooked (ibid.). Fuentes\u2019 ethnographic film \u2013 Bontoc Eulogy \u2013 about a Filipino warrior, his \ngrandfather, brought to the US as ethnographic specimen, challenges qualitative audiences in \ndifferent ways through in its use of \u2018found\u2019 archival footage. The film echoes surrealist methods of \nfound art, and an aesthetic parallel that becomes more apparent when the credits of the film reveal \nall characters and events to be fictional (Rony 2003). The aim is to make the viewer \u2018rethink his or \nher assumptions about authoritarian narration and his or her belief in the \u201ctruth\u201d value of \nethnographic and newsreel footage. \u2026 Like the spectators at the world\u2019s fair whom Fuentes \ndescribes as always wanting to see the natives as untouched, as \u201cauthentic displays of barbaric \nsavagery,\u201d the viewer also desires to believe in the authenticity of Fuentes\u2019s tale\u2019 (Rony 2003:139). \nOur complicity in a desire for the real is thus problematised. \n \nA Modest conclusion: \n I want to end this report by returning our attention to the rich yet ambiguous and messy world of \ndoing qualitative research. As Thrift notes: \u2018Though fieldwork is often portrayed as a classical \ncolonial encounter in which the fieldworker lords it over her\/his respondents, the fact of the matter \nis that it usually does not feel much like that at all. More often it is a curious mixture of \nhumiliations and intimidations mixed with moments of insight and even enjoyment\u2019 (Thrift 2003: \n106), where knowledge is coproduced \u2018by building fragile and temporary commonplaces\u2019 (page \n108, see also Tillmann-Healy 2003). This seems to me a good summary of the qualitative work \ncurrently being done in geography. It remains inspired by ethical and political concerns, and \npractitioners are deeply concerned by the moral and political implications of their work. Some of \nthe old taken-for-granteds about fieldwork have indeed been replaced, but it is instructive to wonder \nwhat questions have not been asked. While we have struggled to populate our work with real \nsubjects rather than research objects, there have been fewer attempts to talk about materialities in \npractice if not in topic. There have been even fewer animalities. While we have talked around \nemotion, there has been less work through emotions \u2013 at least not that is acknowledged. The body \nhas recently become an important topic of work, but not yet something through which research is \noften done. I do not think this entails a rejection of work that has been, is being and will be done; \nnor a turn from engaged and practical work. But I think it does raise issues about the investment in \nspecific notions of what \u2018research\u2019 is, what evidence is and how the two relate to each other. \n \n \n \n \nReferences: \n \nBecker, H.
