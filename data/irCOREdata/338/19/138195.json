Introduction\nPiezoelectric ultrasonic motors [1] have a number ofpotential advantages. They maintain relatively high\ntorque at relatively low speed without a reduction gear\nand exhibit a self-locking feature when electric power is\nturned off, because the driving mechanics use friction be-\ntween the vibrating stator and the rotor. They are light\ncompared with electromagnetic motors, and their equiva-\nlent inertias are low. They neither create electromagnetic\nfields nor are they affected by them. They also have many\nadvantages for applications in microelectromechanical sys-\ntems (MEMS) because, in contrast with electromagnetic\nmotors, their simple construction makes them well suited\nfor miniaturization, and their overall efficiency is relatively\nManuscript received November 24, 2005; accepted May 23, 2006.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the partial financial support of\nthe Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC\ngrant number GR\/N 34017) and BAeSystems (Sowerby Research\nCenter) in the development of the piezoelectric motor and the Na-\ntional Physical Laboratory in the development of the characteriza-\ntion system.\nJ.

In order to compare ultrasonic and elec-\ntrostatic motors, it is important to consider energy densi-\nties [J\/m3] of these two motor types. The maximum en-\nergy density for an electrostatic micro-motor is defined as\n0.5 \u03b5airE2bd, where Ebd is the maximum electric field be-\nfore breakdown (\u223c108 V\/m for 1-\u00b5m gaps) and \u03b5air is the\npermittivity of free space (\u03b50 = 8.854\u221710\u221212 Fm\u22121) [2].\nFor the piezoelectric motor, the energy density becomes\n0.5 \u03b5PZTE2bd, where the electric field can be equivalent\nto that with an electrostatic motor. A three-magnitudes-\nlarger dielectric constant (PC4, \u03b5PZT = 1000 \u03b50 [3]) is\npossible with piezoelectric materials. The greater the en-\nergy density is, the greater potential there is to have higher\ntorque outputs from the motor. Several micro-motor de-\nsigns have been published in the past years based on the\ntraveling-wave principle. In general, traveling wave mo-\ntors require at least two piezoelectric elements shifted in\nspace, which are excited by AC signals shifted in phase.\nAs a result, two-directional rotation can be achieved by\nchanging a phase angle. The traveling wave principle is\ninteresting because of its functional characteristics (two-\ndirectional operation), but complex when realizing the de-\nsign [4], [5]. Another principle to drive micro-motors is a\nstanding wave. Benefits of this method are a single-phase\ndriving method, which allows unidirectional rotation, and\na relatively simple mechanical construction, which pro-\nvides good opportunities for miniaturization [6].\nThis paper presents the design, construction, and opera-\ntional characteristics of the developed flextensional piezo-\nelectric micro-motor. The 2-mm-square motor, which is\nbased on a meso-scale prototype [7], uses a composite sta-\ntor, consisting of a metallic flextensional mode convertor,\nor \u201ccymbal,\u201d bonded to a 2-mm-square piezoelectric plate.\nThe cymbal converts contour-mode vibrations of the plate\ninto oscillations in the cymbal, perpendicular to the sta-\ntor plane. These are further converted into unidirectional\nrotational movement in a rotor pressed against the cym-\nbal by means of an elastic-fin friction drive to produce\nthe required rotary actuation [8]. The driving mechanism\nis very simple, since only a single-phase sinusoidal volt-\nage is needed, in contrast to traveling wave-type motors\n[9], which need two-phase control electronics and are more\ndifficult to manufacture. The manufacture of the micro-\nmotor used a combination of novel microfabrication pro-\ncesses, including electrolytic etching and a microstamping\ntechnique, to manufacture a matrix of 2-mm cymbals from\na metal sheet. The cymbal matrix was further bonded onto\nthe lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) with an epoxy resin. In-\ndirect adhesive bonding is especially attractive in the man-\n0885\u20133010\/$20.00 c\u00a9 2006 IEEE\n2358 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 53, no. 12, december 2006\nufacturing of piezoelectric devices. It is important to stay\nbelow the Curie point, which is, for example, 328\u25e6C for\nPZT 4 [10], in order to avoid the need to re-pole the bonded\nstructure. The operational characteristics of the practical\nmicro-motor were evaluated using high-speed imaging to\nmeasure the mechanical transient characteristics of the ro-\ntor. Based on the analysis of the images and a knowledge of\nthe moments of inertia of the rotating parts (the rotor and\nencoder) and the acceleration, it was possible to calculate\nthe torque. Measurement of the transient characteristics in\nthis noncontact manner permitted the characterization of\ntorques in the range of a few nNm\u2019s. Alternative contact-\nbased methods, such as pulley-brake or using an external\nencoder, would have produced more frictional losses and\nwould have made measurements difficult in this range [11].\nParallel measurements of the electrical characteristics such\nas supply voltage, current, and phase angle allowed mea-\nsurement of the motor\u2019s efficiency.\nII. Design and Operational Principle\nThe design of the micro-motor is shown in Fig. 1. A\nsquare plate stator is attached at the plate\u2019s center point\nto allow free contour movement of the PZT driver. A static\nload is applied to press the rotor in contact with the cym-\nbal, and some lateral movement is allowed at the shaft to\nensure even contact. The rotor has a jewel bearing in the\nmiddle to align the bias force pin. The jewel has a so-called\nolive-shape center to facilitate centering of the bias force\npin. The practical dimensions of the motor are tabulated\nin Table I. An operation of the flextensional micro-motor\nis as follows (in outline): The metallic cymbal flextensional\namplifier converts vibrations of the piezoelectric plate to\noscillations of the metal cymbal in a direction principally\nperpendicular to its plane. An elastic-fin rotor [12] further\nconverts these cymbal oscillations to rotary actuation via\nthree inclined fins pressed out of the rotors. As the vi-\nbrating surface is moving upward (along the z-axis), the\ntip of each fin is held in contact with its surface by static\nfriction. The rotation is generated by the horizontal com-\nponent of the reactive force. When the vibrating surface\nis moving downward, the tips of the fins slip across the vi-\nbrating surface. Speed and torque are adjusted by varying\nthe frequency and amplitude of the (single-phase) sinu-\nsoidal supply voltage.\nIII. Microfabrication and Motor Construction\nA PZT wafer (Ferroperm PZ26TM, \u000250 mm, t = 2 mm)\nwas lapped to 235-\u00b5m thickness. The flatness across the\nsurface of the PZT was measured as \u00b15 \u00b5m. Ti\/Au elec-\ntrodes were RF sputtered onto the lapped surface. The\nTi and Au thicknesses were \u223c8 and 100 nm, respectively.\nThe surface roughness was measured as Ra = 0.2 \u00b5m us-\ning a Dektak 3ST surface profiler (Veeco Instruments Ltd.,\nCambridge, UK).\nTABLE I\nVariables of the Practical Micro-Motor.\nRotor variables Cu encoder (mm)\nRotor diameter, dr 4.9\nRotor thickness, tr 0.038\nFin length, lf (1;2;3) 0.17;0.16;0.15\nFin width, wf (1;2;3) 0.08, 0.08, 0.11\nFin angle, \u03b8 (1;2;3) 15;24;30\nRadius of contact, rr\u2217 (1;2;3) 0.43;0.36;0.47\nJewel dimensions (mm)\nJewel diameter, dj 0.7\nJewel hole diameter, djh 0.08\nJewel height, hj 0.2\nStator dimensions (mm)\nPZT width, ws 2.03\nPZT length, ls 1.96\nPZT thickness, tp 0.235\nTop electrode thickness, tt 0.0001\nBottom electrode thickness, tb 0.01\nBond thickness tbo 0.004\nRadius of mechanical boundary, rp 0.40\nCymbal radius, rc 0.95\nBonding ring radius, rcb 0.88\nCymbal apex radius, rca 0.64\nCymbal\u2019s center hole radius, rcc 0.21\nCymbal height, hc 0.165\nCymbal side angle, \u03b1 35\u25e6\nCymbal thickness, tc 0.048\n*rr is defined in the middle of the Fin.\nManufacturing of the cymbals was based on the use of\nelectrochemical micromachining. A stainless steel metal\nsheet (AISI 316 HV 210) was cleaned of organic com-\npounds with Micro-90\u0001 (International Products Corpora-\ntion, London, UK) cleaning solvent. Both sides of the wet\nsample were laminated with a photoresist 30 \u00b5m in thick-\nness using a Dynachem 350 HR hot roll laminator. The\nphotoresist was exposed with UV-light (Riston PC Printer\n130) through a plastic phototool having cymbal features\nin it. The cymbal matrix was electrolytically etched using\nferric chloride (FeCl3). It was important that only the fea-\ntures to be etched were in contact with electrolyte during\netching. The backside of the sample electrode was cov-\nered with an electric insulating tape. Only the top was left\nuncovered for the electrical connections. Both of the elec-\ntrodes were assembled in parallel (spacing = 10 mm) in a\nspecially engineered plastic jig. The sample electrode was\nconnected to the anode (+) and the back electrode to the\ncathode (\u2212). In practice, the etching time for a stainless\nsteel cymbal matrix (AISI 316 HV 210, t = 40 \u00b5m) was\n22 min when the area etched was \u223c426 mm2. The start-\ning direct current and voltage were adjusted to 1200 mA\nand 2.12 V, respectively. One sample of the etched cymbal\nmatrix is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe cymbal discs in a sheet were individually deformed\nto the designed cavity by stamping with matching punches\nand dies (Fig. 3). Figs. 4 and 5 show these in close up. Four\nguiding pins, shown in Fig. 4, center the tool parts. As a\nresult, a 3-D matrix with 52 cymbals was achieved.\nleinvuo et al.: flextensional ultrasonic piezoelectric micro-motor 2359\nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of the micro-motor construction.\nFig. 2.

Four supports\nlocate a disc.\nThe 3-D cymbal matrix was bonded onto the PZT\ndisc using indirect adhesive bonding with an epoxy resin.\nThe surface of the PZT and the cymbal matrix were\nboth cleaned with 4% Micro-90\u0001, the cymbals ultrason-\nically for 10 min and the PZT by wiping. After this, the\nPZT was covered with the adhesion promoter Ken-React\nLICA 38 (mixture: 0.2% with isopropanol) from Kenrich\nPetrochemicals Inc. (Bayonne, NJ) and then rinsed in a\nspin-coating machine with isopropanol. Electrically non-\nconductive epoxy resin Epo-tek 301-2 was spin coated onto\nthe PZT wafer. The bonding tool was coated with Loctite\nFrekote\u0001 AqualineTM C-200 mould release agent (Henkel\nLoctite Ltd., Hartfordshire, UK) in order to avoid stick-\ning. Bias force of 75 N at temperature of 82\u25e6C was applied\nfor three hours. After bonding, the electrical connections\nwere opened by oxygen plasma etching (ashing) in a Po-\nlaron PT 7160 RF Plasma Barrel Etcher (Polaron PLC,\nWhatford, Hertz, UK). The stators were separated from\neach other with a semiconductor saw (MicroAce Series 3\nfrom Loadpoint Ltd., Swindon, Wiltshire, UK). A cymbal\nmatrix bonded onto the PZT can be seen in Fig. 6.\nA scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a com-\npleted stator, after applying the signal wire, is shown in\nFig. 7. A low-frequency resistance of the electrical connec-\ntions (50 kHz) was measured using a Wayne Kerr Preci-\nsion Component Analyzer 6425 (Wayne Kerr Electronics,\nChichester, West Sussex, UK) integrated with a precision\nprobe station. Resistance on the top was measured as 2 \u2126\nacross the corners of a square plate. The bottom electrode\n(fired-on Ag) was checked between two points and gave a\n2360 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 53, no. 12, december 2006\nFig. 3.

The resistance between the cymbal\nand the top electrode was measured as 8 \u2126. Signal wire\n(Au, t = 40 \u00b5m) was bonded manually under a micro-\nscope by using CircuitWorks\u0001 CW2400 conductive silver\nloaded epoxy from Chemtronics (ITW Chemtronics, Ken-\nnesaw, GA). The bottom of the stator (center point) was\nconnected to the steel post by the same conductive epoxy.\nPrior to testing, the post was connected into the electrical\nground.\nRotors (Fig. 8 and Fig. 9) were manufactured using the\nsame electrolytic etching process as explained above. In\npractice, the etching time for the stainless steel (AISI 302\n(FE\/CR18\/NI8) HARD), t = 25 \u00b5m) rotor matrix was\n10 min when the area etched was \u223c126 mm2. The starting\ndirect current and voltage were 1210 mA and 2.89 V, re-\nspectively. Etching time for the encoder matrix (annealed\ncopper, t = 38 \u00b5m) was 22 min when the area etched was\n\u223c26 mm2. The starting direct current and voltage were\n1235 mA and 4.43 V, respectively. The fins were manu-\nally bent to the desired angle under the microscope. The\nbearing (watch jewel) was also manually bonded under the\nmicroscope.\nIV. Stator Characterization\nImpedance characteristics of the micro-stator were eval-\nuated by an impedance analyzer HP4192A. In practice, the\nstator was fixed onto the steel post. No rotor was attached\nduring the measurements. An excitation voltage of 1 Vrms\nwas connected to the signal wire on the top electrode,\nand the bottom electrode was grounded via a steel post.\nImpedance and phase characteristics were downloaded to\nthe database for analysis. The close-ups of the characteris-\ntic are shown in Fig. 10. Resonance (fm, Zm) and antires-\nonance (fn, Zn) frequencies and impedances are 222 kHz,\n4401 ohms, 223.5 kHz, and 4942 ohms, respectively. The\nmechanical quality factor Qm = 53 was calculated by\nusing (1). Capacitance Cd = \u03b5r\u03b50A\/ts = 0.2 nF, where\n\u03b5r = 1300 (relative permittivity of PZ26 at 1 kHz), \u03b50 =\n8.854\u221710\u221212 Fm\u22121 (vacuum permittivity), A = 4 mm2,\nand ts = 0.235 mm (thickness of the practical PZT ele-\nment). The effective coupling coefficient keff was evaluated\nfrom (2) as 0.12.\nQm =\nf2n\n2\u03c0fmZmCd (f2n \u2212 f2m)\n. (1)\nk2eff \u2248\nCm\nCd + Cm\n=\nf2n \u2212 f2m\nf2n\n. (2)\nV. Motor Characterization\nIn practice, the rotor was assembled on the top of the\ncymbal under a microscope by a pair of needles. After this,\nbias force, i.e., a static load (pin + load) was applied into\nthe middle of the jewel bearing by a specially engineered\nsharp pin 0.8 mm in diameter. The encoder disc used in\nthe characterization of the motor is pictured in Fig. 11.\nThe Cu disc is 5 mm in diameter and 36 \u00b5m in thickness\nand has 70 holes on its outer radius. The black line in the\nnorthwest of the disc is used as an indicator in transient\nand constant speed measurements as will be discussed be-\nlow. Small holes on the disc\u2019s outer radius are used for\nfiberoptic sensor-based constant-speed measurements.\nA. Motor\u2019s Constant Speed\nAn integrated encoder technique was used in parallel\nwith the stroboscopic measurements when the constant\nspeed of the motor was evaluated. In this technique, the\nthrough-beam sensor head (FU 32) was connected to fiber\noptic amplifier unit (FS-V11P), which converted the opti-\ncal signal to the digital pulses [13]. In stroboscopic mea-\nsurements, the flash rate of the stroboscope was adjusted\nto a level where the black marking line became visible\nwhen the motor was operated. The constant speed was\nthen read from the digital oscilloscope (National Instru-\nments PCI-5102 [14]) based on the pulse rate. The rota-\ntional speeds obtained with a stroboscope and fiberoptic\nprobe were 11.2 s\u22121 and 10.2 s\u22121, respectively. The latter\nis approximately 9% lower than that obtained with the\nstroboscope. The difference may have been caused by the\nuneven holes in the encoder disc (Fig. 11) or visual error\nin the stroboscopic method.\nB. Evaluation of the Motor\u2019s Transient Characteristics\nPerhaps the most important measurements to char-\nacterize the micro-motor\u2019s mechanical characteristics are\nthose of acceleration and deceleration. Once acceleration\nis known, the mechanical torque of the motor can be cal-\nculated from the rotor moment of inertia [15] (see (8)).\nSeveral potential measurement methods can be found in\nthe macro-scale. One of the most common methods is to\nuse a ready-made encoder. The rough estimation from the\nsimilar macro-motor shows that the use of the integrated\nencoder technique is difficult to apply since the number of\nleinvuo et al.: flextensional ultrasonic piezoelectric micro-motor 2361\nFig. 4.

On the left, an image of the ready stainless steel rotor with\na jewel bearing; on the right, a cross-sectional view of the jewel and\nthe rotor.\nencoder features is inadequate. In comparison, the similar\nmacro-motor with a stator of size 25 mm (side length of\nthe square plate is 25 mm) has stall torque of 0.47 Nmm\n[16]. The dimensional scale for the frictional force is two\n(L2) and for the length one (L1) [17]. The dimensional\nscale for the torque is then three, because the torque is a\nproduct of frictional force and fin-stator contact radius\n(L2 \u00d7 L1 = L3). As a comparison dimension between\nmacro- and micro-scale, the side lengths of the stators\ncan be used, which are 25 and 2 mm, respectively. This\nleads to the scale ratio of L = 25\/2 = 12.5. The estimated\nmicro-motor torque is then 0.47 Nmm\/12.53 \u2248 0.24 \u00b5Nm.\n2362 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 53, no. 12, december 2006\nFig. 9. SEM image of the fin bending and bearing centering tooling.\nThe rotor is mounted onto the three centering pins and the jewel\nbearing is located at the middle. The diameter of each pin is 0.25 mm.\nFig. 10. Measured impedance and phase characteristics of the prac-\ntical micro-stator close to operational frequency.\nFig. 11. Top view of the micro-motor with the Cu encoder disc\n(\u00025 mm).\nThe acceleration for the micro-motor is now evaluated as\n15,484 rad\/s2 and the time for acceleration ta = 4.5 ms,\nwhere the maximum speed is 11.2 s\u22121 (70.4 rad\/s) and the\nmoment of inertia of Cu encoder Jzz = 15.5\u00d710\u221212 kgm2.\nThe time for one revolution is 1\/11.2 s \u2248 89 ms. Using a\nlinear relationship between the ta, time per one revolution,\nand a number of encoder features per one revolution, the\nnumber of encoder features per ta becomes approximately\nthree. This shows that the number of encoder features in a\nregion of interest is not sufficient to evaluate acceleration.\nThe minimum number of spatial sample points is four,\nin order to evaluate linear approximation of acceleration,\nwhich is the second derivative of displacement (d2s\/dt2).\nAnother way to use the encoder principle would be to in-\ncrease the moment of inertia of the encoder in order to\nincrease ta, as was, for example, done in [18]. Because of\ndifficulties in using the integrated encoder technique in the\ntransient measurements, here an alternative way to mea-\nsure micro motor\u2019s transient characteristics using a high-\nspeed camera will be described.\nC. High-Speed Imaging\nThe Phantom V4.0 is a color high-speed digital imaging\nsystem. The camera uses a CRS-CMOS imaging sensor\nwith 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution. The frame rate can be\nadjusted from 1000 pps (i.e., pictures per second) with\nfull pixel resolution up to the 30,000 pps with allocated\nmemory use. The imager is controlled via a FireWireTM\n(IEEE 1394) using Phantom\u0001 image analyzing software.\nImages are grabbed to the 256-Mb internal memory. A\ntotal of 1024 images can be stored in one second of time\nwith 1000 pps. Once images are captured from the camera,\nthey can be played on the screen and processed [19].\nIn order to gather angular velocity data, the position of\nthe black marking line on the encoder disc (see Fig. 11)\nwas recorded using the ready-built algorithm in Phantom\u0001\nsoftware. Collected points were arranged in a Cartesian\nco-ordinate system as a function of image numbers (N)\nand time (tN ). The linear approximation of the radial dis-\nplacement zN =\n\u221a\n(Xr,N \u2212 Xr,N\u22121)2 + (Yr,N \u2212 Yr,N\u22121)2\ncan be defined from co-ordinate points XN and YN . Since\nthe frame dependent time tN is known from the sampling\nrate, the velocity vN can be calculated as shown in (3):\nvN =\nzN\ntN \u2212 tN\u22121 . (3)\nCollected points (XN , YN ) were further converted to an\nangular velocity using (4), where the radius rN was defined\nas rN =\n\u221a\nX2N + Y\n2\nN :\n\u03c9N =\nvN\nrN\n. (4)\nIt is now possible to evaluate the angular acceleration\nby taking the derivative of the angular speed (5):\n\u03b1N =\n\u03c9N \u2212 \u03c9N\u22121\ntN \u2212 tN\u22121 . (5)\nleinvuo et al.: flextensional ultrasonic piezoelectric micro-motor 2363\nFig. 12. Micro-motor\u2019s transient characteristics represented as a func-\ntion of time.\nNow the angular displacement \u03b8N can be developed\nfrom linear displacement zN by using a cosine rule (6):\n\u03b8N = \u03b1 cos\n(\n\u2212\n(\nz2N \u2212 2r2\n)\n2r2\n)\n. (6)\nAs a result, the rotational speed can be represented as\na function of time (Fig. 12). The shown transient char-\nacteristics were achieved by averaging eight measurement\npoints in series. The fitted speed is based on (10), where\nthe time constant \u03c4a = 28 ms. The fitted angular accel-\neration is achieved as a derivative of the fitted rotational\nspeed (5).\nThe maximum acceleration \u03b1max = 270 s\u22122 \u2248\n1700 rad\/s2 can now be evaluated from Fig. 12. The angu-\nlar displacement \u03b8 during the acceleration is approximately\n43\u25e6. It is important to notice that the step response of the\nmotor is underdamped. Thus a first-order approximation\ndoes not fully model the motor\u2019s transient characteristics.\nUnderdamping may be an indication of insufficient fric-\ntional contact between the rotor and the stator. Another\nindication of the insufficient friction is the stepwise move-\nment of the rotor. When the data were visually analyzed,\nthe motion indicated stick\/release while accelerating and\nduring the constant speed. In practice, the fin dimensions\nare not equal in the practical micro-motor (see Table I),\nwhich can easily be an origin of the stepwise movement\nand underdamped characteristics. It should be noted that\nnoise in the video signal, manually digitized coordinate\npoints, and lack of pixel resolution generated uncertainty\nin the measurements.\nThe achieved deceleration characteristics of the micro-\nmotor are represented in Fig. 13. The deceleration \u03b1d =\n\u2212730 s\u22122 \u2248 \u22124600 rad\/s2 is evaluated by d\u03c9\/dt [(5),\nt1 = 114 ms, t0 = 102 ms, \u03c91 = 1.6 s\u22121, \u03c90 = 10.4 s\u22121].\nThe fall time is td = \u03c4f = 12 ms. Angular displacement\nduring the deceleration is approximately 20\u25e6. It is inter-\nesting to notice that the speed is not constant prior to\ndeceleration. The same variation in speed can also be seen\nFig. 13. Micro-motor\u2019s deceleration characteristics.\nafter the acceleration. The variation of the data points is\nan indication of the stick\/release of the rotor prior to de-\nceleration.\nD. Electrical Characteristics and Efficiency\nParallel to acceleration and deceleration measurements,\nthe electrical characteristics of the micro-motor were eval-\nuated by the PC-integrated dual-channel digital oscillo-\nscope (National Instruments PCI-5102 [14]). Both of the\nchannels were logged simultaneously, which allowed phase\nmeasurements.\nThe electrical power input, mechanical power output,\nand efficiency are defined with (7). Ploss defines the electri-\ncal power loss generated by the measurement electronics,\nTm is the torque of the motor (Nm), and \u03c9 is the angular\nvelocity (rad\/s). Uin and Iin are RMS voltage and current,\nrespectively, supplied to motor. Cos\u03c6 is a power factor,\nwhere \u03c6 is the phase difference between the voltage and\ncurrent signals.\n\u03b7 =\nPout\nPin \u2212 Ploss =\nTm\u03c9\nUinIin cos\u03c6 \u2212 Ploss 100%. (7)\nE. Torque and Frictional Coefficient from the Transient\nCharacteristics\nThe torque of the piezoelectric motor can be defined\nusing (8):\nTm = Jzz\u03b1 = Jzz\nd\u03c9\ndt\n= Jzz\nd2\u03b8\ndt2\n. (8)\nOnce the speed decreases from the no-load speed (\u03c9max)\nto zero, the torque increases toward the stall torque\n(Tm,max) (9):\n\u03c9 = \u03c9max (1 \u2212 Tm\/Tm,max) . (9)\n2364 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 53, no. 12, december 2006\nThe solution for the rise curve can be represented with\n(10) after Tm has been eliminated from (8) and (9). The\nterm \u03c4r represents the time constant and is given in (11).\n\u03c9 = \u03c9max [1 \u2212 exp (\u2212t\/\u03c4r)] . (10)\n\u03c4r = Jzz\u03c9max\/Tm,max. (11)\nThe maximum torque Tm,max can be defined from the\ntime constant \u03c4r when the moment of inertia is known. In\norder to define the speed\/torque characteristics, the an-\ngular speed derivative d\u03c9\/dt must be calculated at ev-\nery measurement point on the rise curve and substituted\ninto (8).\nAfter the vibrator is turned off, the frictional torque\n(Tf = \u00b5mg rr) decelerates the rotation linearly (12). The\n\u00b5, m, g, and rr are the frictional coefficient, mass of the ro-\ntor (mr) and load (mload = 145 mg), gravity (9.81 ms\u22122),\nand the radius of the contact between rotor and stator,\nrespectively.\n\u03c9 = \u03c9max (1 \u2212 t\/\u03c4f ) . (12)\nThe time constant for fall time \u03c4f is written in a following\nform:\n\u03c4f = Jzz\u03c9max\/Tf . (13)\nBy measuring the \u03c4f , the frictional coefficient \u00b5 can be\nestimated by (14):\n\u00b5 =\nJzz\u03c9max\nmgrr\u03c4f\n. (14)\nF. Operational Characteristics\nThe operational characteristics are based on the tran-\nsient characteristics of the micro-motor. The achieved elec-\ntrical and mechanical characteristics are tabulated in Ta-\nble II. Acceleration characteristics consist of frequency (f),\nacceleration time constant (\u03c4a), angular displacement dur-\ning acceleration (\u03b8a), achieved maximum rotational speed\n(Na,max), and maximum angular speed (\u03c9a,max). Deceler-\nation characteristics consist of the same parameters as are\nshown for the acceleration. Also, due to the linear nature\nof the deceleration, the deceleration (\u03b1d), frictional torque\n(Tf = Tm,d), and generated power (Pout,d) are included. In\naddition, calculated dynamic frictional coefficients (\u00b5) are\nshown in the end. Electrical characteristics were recorded\nat the steady state conditions and are the same for the\nacceleration and the deceleration analyses. The first three\nvariables starting from the left are: the measured voltage\n(Uin), current (Iin), and phase angle (\u03c6). Then there are\nshown the input power (Pin) and the resistive power loss\n(Ploss). This approach differs from [15], where the elec-\ntrical characteristics were logged simultaneously with the\nacceleration measurements. However, based on the electri-\ncal measurements with a similar macro-motor, the power\ninput values measured in steady state conditions with dif-\nferent torques were in 1% of margin with no practical effect\nFig. 14. Fitted speed torque characteristics of the flextensional piezo-\nelectric micro-motor.\non the efficiency [11]. The calculated frictional coefficient is\nin accordance with findings of previous research (for BeCu,\n\u00b5 = 0.17 [4]).\nFig. 14 represents the fitted speed torque characteris-\ntics of the micro-motor with the following sampling con-\nditions: \u2206t = 0.1 ms when t \u2264 1.3 ms, and \u2206t = 0.5 ms\nwhen t > 1.3 ms. The achieved maximum torque comes\nas Tm,max = 0.027 \u00b5Nm. It is interesting to note that the\nachieved maximum torque is \u223c10% of the estimated value\nbased on the pulley-brake torque measurements of a simi-\nlar macro-motor (Tm,estimate = 0.24 \u00b5Nm [11]). The differ-\nence could be explained by the bearing configuration. The\nmacro-motor used a ball bearing and the micro-motor a\njewel sliding bearing (i.e., a coefficient of friction for rolling\nis generally smaller than it is for sliding). Detailed analysis\nrelated to the frictional losses is not included in this study.\nThe achieved maximum efficiency was evaluated as \u223c0.6%\n(Fig. 14).\nVI. Discussion\nThis paper has presented the experimental design, con-\nstruction, and operational characteristics of a new type of\npiezoelectric ultrasonic micro-motor in a range of 2 mm.\nThe design used the same principle as a similar macro-\nmotor reported previously [7]. The design was scaled down\nby a factor of 12.5 and a different bearing configuration was\nadapted. The macro-motor used a ball bearing and here a\njewel bearing was used. The motor design described here\nwas especially designed to suit non-silicon MEMS man-\nufacturing processes. Especially, the square plate stator\ngives advantages in matrix-based MEMS processes, since\ndicing-out of the devices can be made by using a standard\nsemiconductor saw. The practical fabrication process in-\ncluded an electrolytic etching, which was used to fabricate\nrotors and stators from the metal sheet, and 3-D structures\nwere achieved by a stamping technique. Stator structures\nwere achieved after bonding the cymbal matrices onto the\nleinvuo et al.: flextensional ultrasonic piezoelectric micro-motor 2365\nTABLE II\nAchieved Electrical and Mechanical Characteristics of the Cu Encoder.\nAcceleration characteristics\nf \u03c4r \u03b8a Na,max \u03c9a,max\n(kHz) (ms) (deg) (1\/s) (rad\/s)\n224 2850.00 43 8 50\nDeceleration characteristics\nf \u03c4f \u03b8a Nd,max \u03c9d,max \u03b1d Tm,d Pout,d \u00b5\n(kHz) (ms) (deg) (1\/s) (rad\/s) (rad\/s2) (nNm) (\u00b5W)\n224 12 20 10 66 5600 870 57 0.15\nElectrical characteristics\nUin Iin \u03c6 Pin Ploss\n(Vrms) (mArms) (deg) (\u00b5W) (\u00b5W)\n7 0.45 269 62 5.6\nlapped PZT plate. This manufacturing process was proved\nto work, although the yield of working stators in this pro-\ntotype was only 20%. Problems were mainly encountered\nin adhesive bonding and dicing. In bonding, the cymbal\ngrid stuck onto the bonding tool or was not bonded onto\nthe PZT plate. In dicing, some cymbals seemed to col-\nlapse. The possible reason for this may have been the wa-\nter pressure in the dicing saw. With rotors, the bonding of\nthe jewel onto the rotor was demanding. The cyanoacry-\nlate adhesive spread out and control of the drop size was\ndifficult. However, the methodology used here to manu-\nfacture 2-mm micro-motors of a relatively simple design is\nproven, and further development could undoubtedly solve\nthe problems outlined above. With the help of modern\nrobotics, the fin bending, bearing attachment, and final\nassembly can be made efficient and accurate. Based on the\nachieved experiences of the way to manufacture stator el-\nements, the adaptation to series production should not be\ntoo difficult. The individual process steps are well known\nand, after the fine-tuning of the separate steps, such as\netch time and electrode arrangements, the quality of the\nend product can be drastically improved.\nThe stall torque (27 nNm) was evaluated from the\nfitted nonlinear representation of the acceleration. The\ntransient characteristic was achieved from the recorded\nstream of images. The acceleration time constant and angle\nwere 2850 ms and 43\u25e6, respectively. The first assumption\nbased on the results from similar macro-motor suggested\na factor-of-ten greater torque value should be achievable.\nThe likely reason for the result achieved is the bearing con-\nfiguration, which was here a jewel slide bearing. In macro-\nscale, the ball bearing, in general, has a smaller frictional\ncoefficient. Therefore, it would be interesting to run a test\nin a macro-scale with a jewel bearing or perhaps in a micro-\nscale with a ball bearing. The rotor\/stator frictional coeffi-\ncient 0.15, evaluated based on the deceleration characteris-\ntics, is in accordance with the previous research where the\nsame value was achieved for the BeCu-BeCu interface [4].\nThis partly proves the reliability of the transient measure-\nments. From the measurements reliability point-of-view,\nit was important to evaluate no-load speed with fiberoptic\nsensor and stroboscopic techniques. Results obtained from\nall three measurements gave practically the same reading.\nThe achieved maximum efficiency (\u223c0.6%, Fig. 14) is\nclose to that of other micro-motors using elastic-fin de-\nsigns (0.17% [20]). In order to improve the efficiency, the\nstick\/release found from high-speed images (see Figs. 12\nand 13) should be analyzed in detail. Perhaps, an experi-\nment similar to that with the macro-motor with different\nfin angles [7] could give answers for the optimal fin an-\ngle. Also, increasing the frictional coefficient with polymer\ncoatings would improve the efficiency.\nReferences\n[1] K.

Leinvuo was born in Helsinki, Fin-\nland, in April 1971. He received his M.S. de-\ngree in M.E. (Mechatronics) from Helsinki\nUniversity of Technology in 2000 and his\nPh.D. degree from Cranfield University, UK,\nin 2005, for research related to piezoelectric\nmotors and micro-motors. He currently holds\na position at VTI Technologies, Finland, as\na sensor design engineer related to microelec-\ntromechanical pressure sensors. His research\ninterest includes piezoelectric motors, micro-\nmotors, and pressure sensors.\nStephen A. Wilson is a senior research fel-\nlow in Advanced Materials at Cranfield Uni-\nversity, UK. He received a Ph.D. degree at\nCranfield University for his thesis on \u201cElec-\ntric Field Structuring of Piezoelectric Com-\nposites,\u201d which explored the use of mod-\nerately high electric fields during process-\ning to induce anisotropic properties in fer-\nroelectric ceramic\/polymer composite materi-\nals. His study of materials processing param-\neters has been used to optimize the perfor-\nmance of piezoelectric sensor arrays for a real-time 3D ultrasound\nimaging system, and his research interests are in piezoelectric micro-\nactuators, ultraprecision machining of ceramics, and dielectrophore-\nsis. He is a module coordinator and lectures on microsystems design.\nRoger W. Whatmore graduated with his\nPh.D. degree from Cambridge University, UK,\nin 1977, and spent nearly twenty years work-\ning with the GEC Marconi (formerly Plessey)\nResearch Laboratories at Caswell in the UK\non the development and exploitation of ferro-\nelectric materials in a wide range of electronic\ndevices, particularly sensors and actuators,\nfor which work he was awarded GEC\u2019s Nel-\nson Gold Medal in 1993. In October 1994, he\ntook the Royal Academy of Engineering Chair\nin Engineering Nanotechnology at Cranfield\nUniversity, where he is developing the use of ferroelectrics in mi-\ncrosystems and nanotechnology, particularly for sensors and actua-\ntors integrated onto silicon. He has published over 200 papers and\nhas 30 patents in the field. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of\nScience by Cambridge University in 2001. He is a Fellow of the Royal\nAcademy of Engineering and a Fellow of the Institute of Materials,\nMinerals and Mining, which in June 2003 awarded him its Griffith\nMedal and Prize for Distinguished Work in Materials Science.\nMarkys G. Cain is a Principal Research\nScientist at the National Physical Laboratory\n(NPL), UK, and runs the Functional Mate-\nrials Research Group within the Division of\nEngineering and Process Materials. He is also\ntheir Knowledge Leader for Process Materials\nand oversees strategy development within Ma-\nterials. He graduated from Warwick Univer-\nsity with a B.Sc. degree in physics in 1986 and\ncompleted his Ph.D. degree, also at Warwick,\nin materials physics in 1989. Following a two-\nyear postdoctoral appointment at the Univer-\nsity of California, Santa Barbara\u2019s Materials Department, where he\nworked in developing process methods and models for epitaxial thin\nfilms, he returned to the UK as a Senior Research Fellow at War-\nwick University to start developing new characterization measure-\nment methods for ceramic matrix composites with Rolls Royce and\nan SEM-based microindentation machine with Oxford Instruments.\nHe joined NPL in 1997 and leads the Functional Materials Group in\ndeveloping metrology and measurement good practice for piezoelec-\ntric bulk and thin film materials. He is author or co-author of over 90\npublications in the fields of ceramic matrix composites, ferroelastic\nmaterials, the use of neutron and synchrotron radiation for in-situ\nmaterials characterization, and piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyro-\nelectric bulk and thin film materials for integrated microsystems.\n"}
