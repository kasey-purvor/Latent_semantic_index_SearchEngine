These comprised grass silage (G); proportionately 0\u00b767 grass silage, proportionately 0\u00b733 maize silage (GGM); 0\u00b733 grass silage, 0\u00b767 maize silage ( MMG); maize silage ( M) from 424 (s.d. = 11\u00b75) kg to slaughter at a minimum weight of 560 kg. Forages were mixed and offered ad libitum. Steers were offered 2 kg of a concentrate daily, the concentrate being formulated such that all steers had similar crude protein intakes across dietary treatments. A sample of steers was slaughtered at the beginning of the experimental period to allow the calculation of the rate of gain of the carcass and its components. Carcass dissection of a sample of steers allowed the development of a prediction equation of carcass composition based on thoracic limb dissection of all carcasses. Forage dry matter intake and live-weight gain increased linearly as maize silage replaced grass silage in the forage mixture, resulting in improvements in food conversion ratio (all P = 0\u00b7001). Killing-out proportion increased with maize silage inclusion ( P < 0\u00b7001) but fat and conformation scores did not differ significantly between diets. However, increasing maize inclusion in the diet resulted in a greater weight ( P = 0\u00b705) and proportion ( P = 0\u00b7008) of fat in the carcass, and significant increases in internal fat deposition. The inclusion of maize led to a progressive increase in the daily gains of carcass ( P < 0\u00b7001), and significant increases in the daily gains of both fat ( P < 0\u00b7001) and lean tissue ( P < 0\u00b7001). Fat colour was more yellow in cattle given diets G and GGM than diets MMG and M ( P < 0\u00b7001) and colour intensity was lower on diet M than the other three diets ( P < 0\u00b7001). There were no significant differences in any aspects of eating quality between diets.
