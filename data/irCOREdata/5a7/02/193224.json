This period has seen a rapid\ngrowth in provision of care and dramatic improvements\nin the survival of premature infants.1 However, these\ndevelopments have been accompanied by concern that\nthe falling mortality may have been achieved at the cost\nof high rates of disability in survivors.\nInformation on late morbidity in survivors of neo\u203a\nnatal intensive care is needed by several groups of\npeople: by parents, so that they can understand the\npossible consequences of survival in their baby and\ntake informed decisions about their child\u2019s care; by the\nclinical team, for sharing with parents, for evaluating\ntheir service, and for research; by commissioners of\nneonatal care and other services for children, so that\nthey can make informed decisions and plans; and by\nthe general public, so that they can take part in an\ninformed debate on priorities in health care.\nAlthough official reports since 1992 have high\u203a\nlighted the need for neonatal units and health authori\u203a\nties to collect information on later morbidity,2\u20135 it\nremains generally unavailable on a population basis or\noutside specialist centres. However, there is broad\nagreement on the data that should be collected and on\nthe features of systems to collect such data.6 Such\nsystems should be simple, standardised between units,\nbased on existing data collection systems (and hence\nbe capable of being implemented at little additional\nexpenditure), and capable of achieving high levels of\nascertainment.6 We carried out a pragmatic cluster\nrandomised controlled trial to compare two\napproaches to the collection and collation of\ninformation on preterm infants who had required\nneonatal intensive care and had survived to 2 years of\nage. Both systems had the potential to fulfil these crite\u203a\nria. One method was based on a parental assessment of\nthe child\u2019s health at 2 years. The other method relied\non collation and review of clinical information\ncollected as part of routine service delivery.\nMethods\nWe collected information on a group of babies at high\nrisk who had been admitted to the neonatal units of the\nnine collaborating hospitals in the former Trent and\nWessex NHS regions over one calendar year (1997). All\nunits provided intensive care, but this was a bigger com\u203a\nponent of the workload of the large units. Babies were\neligible for inclusion in the study if they were born at\n<32 completed weeks of gestation (that is, up to and\nincluding 32 weeks and 6 days) and if their mothers lived\nin the health authority in which the hospital was located.\nA hierarchical dating algorithm on the basis of last\nDepartment of\nChild Health,\nUniversity of\nLeicester Medical\nSchool, Leicester\nLE1 6TP\nDavid Field\nprofessor of neonatal\nmedicine\nDepartment of\nEpidemiology and\nPublic Health,\nUniversity of\nLeicester Medical\nSchool\nElizabeth S Draper\nsenior research fellow\nBradley Manktelow\nstatistician\nCaroline R\nLamming\nresearch health visitor\nWessex Institute for\nHealth Research\nand Development,\nUniversity of\nSouthampton,\nSouthampton\nSO16 7PX\nMelanie J Gompels\nresearch midwife\nMedtap\nInternational,\nLondon W1Y 1RL\nColin Green\nhealth economist\nNational Perinatal\nEpidemiology Unit,\nInstitute of Health\nSciences, Oxford\n0X3 9DU\nAnn Johnson\ndevelopmental\npaediatrician\nPoole General\nHospital, Dorset\nBH15 2JB\nDavid Shortland\nconsultant\npaediatrician\ncontinued over\nBMJ 2001;323:1\u20135\n1BMJ VOLUME 323 1 DECEMBER 2001 bmj.com\nmenstrual period, ultrasound scanning, and other\nclinical information was used to assess gestation.\nBefore the start of the study we randomised\nneonatal units to one of the two intervention arms. We\nused minimisation7 to ensure that the two arms of the\ntrial were about equal by region, city (Leicester and\nNottingham, which each had two participating\nneonatal units), and size of unit (Wessex had three\nsmall and two large units; all units in Trent were large).\nThe assignment of units within each region was\nperformed by a statistician who was not part of the\nstudy team using tables of random sampling numbers.\nThe identity of neonatal units was concealed in sealed\nenvelopes.\nInformation collected on all babies, regardless of\nintervention arm, was based on the Oxford minimum\ndataset.6 The Oxford dataset provides a framework for\ndescribing health status at 2 years of age (corrected for\ngestation at delivery) focusing particularly on major\nhealth problems\u2014for instance, if the child is blind or\nhas severe developmental delay. It also includes basic\ndemographic and clinical information about the child\u2019s\nearly clinical management. All babies in the study were\n\u201cflagged\u201d with the NHS central registry, which allowed\nus to be aware of children who had moved or died and\nhence enabled us to avoid contacting parents whose\nchild had died after discharge from the neonatal unit.\nInterventions\nThe essence of both interventions was that a small\namount of clerical time was funded to enable follow up\nof eligible babies by using a core protocol and\nstandardised data collection materials but with consid\u203a\nerable flexibility to tailor activity to local circumstances.\nThe study was coordinated on a regional basis, with\none coordinator in Trent and one in Wessex. To\nprevent the coordinators becoming part of the\nintervention, their role with clerks was restricted to\ntraining, developing the local system, and, thereafter,\ntriggering requests for information.\nParental assessment intervention\u2014Before the infant\nwas discharged from the neonatal unit, the clerk based\nin the unit asked parents if they would take part in the\nstudy. When agreement was obtained, the clerk noted\nbasic demographic and clinical details about the baby6\nand provided parents with supplementary pages to\ninsert into their child health record. These pages con\u203a\ntained forms for parents to complete with their assess\u203a\nment of the child\u2019s health at 2 years (corrected for\ngestation). The parents kept the child health record,\nwhich was marked with a study sticker, and the baby\u2019s\ngeneral practitioner and health visitor were notified of\nthe family\u2019s participation in the study. After discharge\nthe unit clerk kept occasional informal contact with\nparents through birthday and Christmas cards to the\nchild. On each contact, a reply paid card was enclosed\nfor the parents to inform the clerk of receipt and any\nchanges of address. At 2 years corrected age, the clerk\nwrote to the parents, inviting them to complete and\nreturn the supplementary pages in the child health\nrecord. Parents were free to ask for help in doing this,\nincluding help from their general practitioner or\nhealth visitor.\nCommunity review intervention\u2014Before the infant\nwas discharged from the neonatal unit the clerk\nobtained consent and basic descriptive information, as\ndescribed above. This information was then passed to a\ndesignated clerk in the community child health\ndepartment. Over the next two years, the community\nbased clerk developed and maintained a file of\ninformation on each child, using whatever sources of\nclinical information were routinely available. These\nmight include hospital discharge summaries, infor\u203a\nmation from routine child health surveillance, and out\u203a\npatient letters. If the family moved out of the area, the\nclerk tried to obtain appropriate information from\nservices in the new area. When the child reached 2\nyears corrected age, the clerk was asked to collate and\nreview the information and complete a customised\nform to record equivalent items of information to\nthose obtained by parental assessment.\nProcedure\nAlthough our primary aim was to test two different\nmethods of data collection, we thought it was necessary\nto show that the items of information we collected were\nvalid. To do this, we selected a 10% sample of children\nin each method by taking every child recorded as hav\u203a\ning a major health problem at 2 years and every fifth\nchild who was reported as not having a major health\nproblem, starting with births from 15 April 1997, until\na quota of 47 children had been achieved. These\nchildren were visited at home within six weeks of their\n2nd birthday (corrected age) by one of the study coor\u203a\ndinators (either a health visitor or a neonatal nurse).\nThe coordinator, who had not seen the information\nalready recorded for the child at 2 years, reviewed the\nsame areas of development by interview of the parents\nand assessment of the child. She then checked for any\ndiscrepancies between her information and that\nobtained in either intervention arm and attempted to\nobtain further information from the parents to resolve\ndiscrepancies.\nWe chose a sample size of 233 children in each arm\nof the trial to give 90% power, at the 5% significance\nlevel, to detect a 15% difference between the two\ngroups in the proportion of children having outcome\ndata at 2 years corrected age. Previous work with\nroutine systems has shown that outcome data are avail\u203a\nable for about 80% of 2 year old children.8 We hypoth\u203a\nesised that in this investigation one method might be\nsimilar to this level and the other might show an\nincrease to 95%. We considered 95% as the target in\nterms of achieving a representative sample of children\nat 2 years.9 The calculation of sample size was based on\nthe conservative assumption of four clusters within\neach arm and a maximum intraclass correlation of\n0.025.10\nTo ensure the accuracy of the database we used a\ndouble data entry method. Data were stored on an\nAccess database and analysed with SAS, version 8.0.\nWe carried out a pragmatic analysis for the trial with a\nprimary outcome of \u201can ability to ascertain the overall\noutcome of a child (at 2 years corrected age) into one\nof two categories: normal or severe functional loss.\u201d To\nallow for the cluster randomised design we calculated\nthe proportion of positive responses for each outcome\nof interest at each hospital and used the results as sum\u203a\nmary statistics for each hospital. We then compared the\ntwo groups using these summary statistics by weighted\ntwo sample t tests.11\nPapers\nImperial College\nSchool of Medicine,\nLondon SW7 2AZ\nMitch Blair\nsenior lecturer in child\nhealth\nMedical Research\nCouncil\nEnvironmental\nEpidemiology Unit,\nUniversity of\nSouthampton,\nSouthampton\nGeneral Hospital,\nSouthampton\nSO16 6YD\nCatherine Law\nsenior lecturer\nCorrespondence to:\nD Field\ndfield@uhl.\ntrent.nhs.uk\n2 BMJ VOLUME 323 10 NOVEMBER 2001 bmj.com\nWe also carried out a health economic appraisal.\nResources used within the data collection process con\u203a\nsisted primarily of staff costs but additional variable\nresource items, such as services of the Office for\nNational Statistics and consumables, were also\nincluded. To assess the additional staff input required\nin the data collection process we carried out an\nexercise on workload for data collection in each of the\nthree years that the study was running. Clerks were\nasked to keep a diary of the time they spent working on\nthe study. Study coordinators completed a question\u203a\nnaire on their time input to the study, separating out\ntasks specific to the study (research) and ongoing tasks\nthat formed part of the data collection process.\nWe assessed the value of staff time using standard\npay scales applied to ward clerks, community clerks,\nand health visitors.12 13 An additional overhead of 24%\nwas applied to the ward\/community clerk pay scale to\ncover employment costs (employers\u2019 national insur\u203a\nance contributions and superannuation) and standard\noverheads (for example, office space and equipment).\nWe obtained ethical approval from the eight local\nresearch ethics committees relating to the participating\nneonatal and community child health services.\nResults\nWe recruited 236 infants to each arm of the study\n(table 1). There were no significant differences between\nthe two arms in terms of clinical characteristics. Of\nthose infants eligible for recruitment, two in each arm\nwere not approached because of a failure of\nprocedures. Three families refused to join the parent\nquestionnaire arm of the study, and in two of these\ncases this seemed to be because of language difficulties.\nSeventeen families declined to take part in the\ncommunity follow up arm. In most cases no reason was\nstated, but some families expressed concern that the\nstudy might provide information to social services.\nFour children in the community follow up arm\ndied between recruitment and a corrected age of 2\nyears. None of the children in the parental question\u203a\nnaire arm of the study died. As outcome in these chil\u203a\ndren was known we included them in the appropriate\nnumerators and denominators.\nSome information was obtained from parents of\n214 (90.7%) children, while community clerks reported\non 223 (94.5%). The 214 responses from parents were\nlargely complete. In each of the nine fields of develop\u203a\nment covered by the Oxford minimum dataset, health\nstatus was described in no less than 210 cases. In con\u203a\ntrast, community returns showed more variation,\nparticularly in relation to motor development (193\ncomplete) and communication (197 complete). As a\nresult of these differences complete data were available\nfor a far higher proportion of children in the parental\narm (85.2%, 95% confidence interval 76.0% to 94.3% v\n67.0%, 42.9% to 91.0%), although in 60 of the 65 cases\nin the community arm where data were missing this\nwas limited to just one or two fields of development.\nMost of these infants were from just one centre.\nTable 2 shows a summary comparison of the two\nmethods. Percentages relate to ascertainment in\nrelation to the 236 infants recruited to each arm. The\nproportion of returned questionnaires, with details of\ntheir completeness, is provided for each method with\n95% confidence intervals, which are adjusted for the\ncluster design.\nAccuracy\nMore of the parents\u2019 questionnaires had all fields com\u203a\npleted compared with the community questionnaires\n(difference 18%, P = 0.048). Of the 214 questionnaires\nreturned by parents, only 51.4% of were returned, as\nrequested, within six weeks of their child reaching a\ncorrected age of 2 years. This compared with 71.2% in\nthe community arm. Data from the community arm\nwere often not current, with clerks having access only\nto information about the child from the last time he or\nshe was seen. Comments about the child\u2019s abilities were\nbased on information recorded before 18 months of\ncorrected age in 28% of cases. Because of the timing of\nroutine screening this was a particular problem in rela\u203a\ntion to vision. However, even after we excluded this\nitem the proportion of variables reported on the basis\nof data before 18 months of corrected age was still\n22%. Information was retrieved from various sources\navailable to the clerks. However, about two thirds was\nobtained either by contacting the health visitor or by\nreviewing the records of earlier assessments held on\nthe community database.\nFrom data returned by parents we identified 26\nchildren (11.0%) with severe functional loss in one or\nmore fields, while for 105 (44.5%) there were no\nTable 1 Basic demographic data in study of outcome in children\nwho were born premature and who had required neonatal\nintensive care\nParent\nquestionnaire\nCommunity\nquestionnaire\nNo recruited into trial 236 236\nBirth weight (g)\n<1000 48 38\n1000\u203a1499 83 92\n1500\u203a2499 102 96\n>2500 2 3\nMissing 1 7\nGestational age (weeks):\n<28 59 62\n29\u203a32 177 172\nMedian (range) duration of stay in\nhospital (days)\n36.5 (2\u203a358) 44.0 (7\u203a259)\nNo ventilated 129 121\nMedian (range) time of ventilation (days) 4 (1\u203a54) 3 (1\u203a65)\nTable 2 Statistical comparison of two methods of ascertaining outcome in children who were born premature and who had required\nneonatal intensive care.

Information obtained by community\nsurveillance produced figures of 20 children (8.6%)\nwith severe functional loss in one or more fields and 98\n(42.2%) with apparently normal health.\nValidation\nStudy coordinators visited and assessed 47 children to\ndetermine whether health status had been correctly\nassigned. All 23 for whom information had been\nprovided by parents were found to have been correctly\nallocated by parental report (eight had severe\nfunctional loss, 15 were normal). Of the 24 children\nassessed from their community records (10 with\nreported severe functional loss, 14 normal), five were\nfound to have been incorrectly allocated by the\ncommunity clerks. All five were children recorded as\nhaving severe functional loss when in fact they were\nnormal. In three cases this occurred because the clerk\ncompleted the form with data about development that\nhad been obtained when the child was much younger\nand the record had not been updated in relation to\nlater progress. In two cases the records were\nambiguous in terms of the child\u2019s health.\nFinancial analysis\nThe costs of implementing the two approaches were\nan average of \u00a32271 per centre (range \u00a31520\u203a\u00a33170)\nwith the parental questionnaire and \u00a33709 (\u00a32430\u203a\n\u00a34047) with the community review. The variation by\ncentre largely reflected the working practices of the\nclerks involved, with marked differences in the time\nspent on each case. The equivalent figures for average\ncost per case recruited were \u00a337 (\u00a325\u203a\u00a352) for the\nparental questionnaire and \u00a361 (\u00a340\u203a\u00a367) for the\ncommunity review.\nDiscussion\nSeveral reviews and inquiries have commented on the\nimportance of information about long term health\noutcomes for children who receive neonatal intensive\ncare.3 4 14 While this is self evident in relation to the\nchildren concerned, the comments have generally\nbeen based on the wider importance of such\ninformation. \u201cQuality care\u201d in relation to neonatal care\nshould equate with high rates of survival among\nchildren who need this type of support and who then\ngo on to function normally in society. This type of\ninformation would clearly be of interest to parents,\nwho want to know not just if their premature infant will\nsurvive but the chances that he or she will be normal.\nCommunity services and specialist education provision\ncould be delivered much more efficiently if planning\nwas informed by accurate and ongoing data about the\nhealth status of the target population. Despite this clear\nneed for information, apart from isolated cohort stud\u203a\nies funded as research, it is simply not available in the\nUnited Kingdom or indeed in much of the developed\nworld.\nPast problems\nThe failure to make progress in this area seems to\nresult from several factors. The initial focus of neonatal\nintensive care was on improving survival. Therefore,\nalthough outcome was seen as important, procedures\nto gain these data were not established in a systematic\nfashion. Where cohorts of infants have been reviewed\nin later childhood the approach has generally been to\nuse a detailed series of tests to look for minor as well as\nmajor variations from normal. These types of\nassessment require the use of trained professionals and\nhence are costly.15 The community services in the\nUnited Kingdom perform health surveillance as part\nof their core activity and collect information about the\nhealth status of all children.16 Currently there is no\nroutine system for identifying subgroups, such as\ninfants who have required intensive care, to allow their\ndata to be abstracted. More importantly there is no\nnational protocol with regard to how and when\nchildren are reviewed by community services. Similarly\nthe approach to documentation and recording varies\nwidely.8\nNew opportunities\nWe wanted to identify a simple method of obtaining\ndata about the later health status of this group of chil\u203a\ndren, who are at high risk of long term neurodevelop\u203a\nmental problems (although the methods should apply\nto any other group\u2014for instance, those below a certain\nbirth weight). We chose a corrected age of 2 years as we\nthought this would provide feedback to clinicians in a\ntime frame that was still relevant to their practice. The\nlevel of detail was selected to be informative for all\ninterested groups while being cheap to collect.\nAlthough we aimed to compare the two methods,\nwe were aware that even if modest numbers of children\nwere lost to follow up serious under\u203areporting of\nimpairments could occur.9 Because of this, our target\nfor either method to succeed was to achieve outcome\ndata for 95% of eligible children. This did not occur,\nand hence overall outcomes (rates of normality and\nserious impairment) must be interpreted with caution,\nparticularly in the community arm where ascertain\u203a\nment was based on only 67% of the infants recruited.\nWhile this is disappointing, there are positive elements\nto emerge from both methods.\nMost parents clearly found the questionnaire easy\nto use and were able to provide accurate information,\nalthough we thought some misunderstood the concept\nof corrected age. Further refinement, particularly for\nwhen English is not the family\u2019s first language, may\nimprove the response rate. While we suggested to\nfamilies at recruitment that they could get advice from\na health visitor or general practitioner when they com\u203a\npleted the form, we did not try actively to involve these\nprofessional groups. If the 35 families who could not\ncomplete all questions or did not return the form at all\nhad asked for help, the level of ascertainment could\nhave risen to above our threshold for success of 95%\nbut would have added considerably to the costs.\nIn relation to the community review some\ninformation was available for 94.5% of children. This\nhigh return was achieved because existing systems\nallowed the clerks to track children even when they\nmoved districts. However, the systems for collecting\nand recording information were variable, and hence\nthere were areas of development for which either there\nwas no information or the information recorded could\nnot be interpreted. Electronic patient records will pro\u203a\nvide an opportunity to deal with the issues of definition\nand recording of outcome. The timing of reviews and\ndecisions about who should be reviewed need to be\nconsidered by the relevant professional groups as a\nPapers\n4 BMJ VOLUME 323 10 NOVEMBER 2001 bmj.com\nmatter of urgency. It is hard to identify value for money\nwithin the current system. Similarly it is hard to justify\nthe extent of local variation given previous recommen\u203a\ndations.17 18\nFinancial context\nGiven the financial constraints of the NHS it is often\ndifficult to convince commissioners of health care that\nexpenditure on obtaining follow up data is justified.\nThe cost of neonatal intensive care is around \u00a31000 a\nday and about 1.5% of births in the United Kingdom\nare at <32 weeks\u2019 gestation. The additional costs asso\u203a\nciated with the methods used in this study (highest esti\u203a\nmate \u00a367 per case) are trivial by comparison and might\nlead to information on the success or otherwise of\nneonatal care, which at present can be measured only\nby early mortality.\nWith further refinement, both of the approaches\ntested in this study seem to have the potential to\nprovide this information, but at present neither is\nadequate.\nWe thank the perinatal teams in the participating hospitals and,\nin particular, Hazel Lacy and David Curnock, Neonatal Unit,\nNottingham City Hospital NHS Trust; Val Walster and Judith\nGrant, Neonatal Unit, Queen\u2019s Medical Centre, University Hos\u203a\npital NHS Trust; Christine Clark, Neonatal Unit, Leicester Royal\nInfirmary NHS Trust; Joy Tibbles and Wren Hoskyns, Neonatal\nIntensive Care Unit, Leicester General Hospital NHS Trust;\nHelen Holden and Rashmin Tamhne, Directorate of Children\u2019s\nServices, Leicestershire and Rutland Healthcare NHS Trust; Sue\nCurtis, Nottingham Community Health NHS Trust; R O Walters\nand Lynne Field, Neonatal Unit, North Hampshire Hospital;\nP Rowlandson, C Burtwell, and J Turner, Neonatal Unit,\nSt Mary\u2019s Hospital NHS Trust, Isle of Wight; C Holme, Royal\nDevon and Exeter Healthcare NHS Trust; J Barnes and I Webb,\nSalisbury District Hospital; S Reveley, R Coppen, and S French,\nPoole Hospital NHS Trust; M A Hall and A Holloway\u203aMoger,\nPrincess Anne Hospital, Southampton; M Sutton, Winchester;\nand Helen Moody, Southampton Community Health.
