A subalgebra U of a Lie algebra L is\ncalled\n\u2022 modular in L if it is a modular element in the lattice of subalgebras of\nL; that is, if\n< U,B > \u2229C =< B,U \u2229 C > for all subalgebras B \u2286 C,\nand\n< U,B > \u2229C =< B \u2229 C,U > for all subalgebras U \u2286 C,\n(where, < U,B > denotes the subalgebra of L generated by U and B);\n1\n\u2022 upper modular in L (um in L) if, whenever B is a subalgebra of L\nwhich covers U \u2229B (that is, such that U \u2229B is a maximal subalgebra\nof B), then < U,B > covers U ;\n\u2022 lower modular in L (lm in L) if, whenever B is a subalgebra of L such\nthat < U,B > covers U , then B covers U \u2229B;\n\u2022 semi-modular in L (sm in L) if it is both u.m. and l.m. in L.\nIn this paper we extend the study of sm subalgebras started in [12]. In\nsection two we give an example of a Lie algebra over a perfect field of char-\nacteristic three which has a sm subalgebra that is not modular. However, it\nis shown that for all solvable Lie algebras, and for all Lie algebras over an\nalgebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0 that have absolute toral rank\n\u2264 1 or are restricted, the conditions of modularity, semi-modularity and be-\ning a quasi-ideal are equivalent. The latter extends results of Varea in [16]\nwhere the characteristic of the field is restricted to p > 7. It is then shown\nthat for all Lie algebras having the one-and-a-half generation property the\nconditions of modularity and semi-modularity are equivalent.\nIn section three, sm subalgebras of dimension one are studied. These\nare characterised over fields of characteristic different from 2, 3. This result\ngeneralises a result of Varea in [15] concerning modular atoms. In the fourth\nsection we show that, over a perfect field of characteristic different from 2, 3,\nthe only Lie algebra containing a two-dimensional core-free sm subalgebra is\nsl2(F ). It is also shown that, over certain fields, every sm subalgebra that is\nsolvable, or that is split and contains the normaliser of each of its non-zero\nsubalgebras, is modular.\nThroughout, L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field F .\nThere will be no assumptions on F other than those specified in individual\nresults. The symbol \u2018\u2295\u2019 will denote a vector space direct sum. If U is a\nsubalgebra of L, the core of U , UL, is the largest ideal of L contained in U ;\nwe say that U is core-free if UL = 0. We denote by R(L) the solvable radical\nof L, by Z(L) the centre of L, and put CL(U) = {x \u2208 L : [x,U ] = 0}.\n2 General results\nWe shall need the following result from [12].\nLemma 2.1 Let U be a proper sm subalgebra of a Lie algebra L over an\narbitrary field F . Then U is maximal and modular in < U, x > for all\nx \u2208 L \\ U .\n2\nProof: We have that U is maximal in < U, x >, by Lemma 1.4 of [12], and\nhence that U is modular in < U, x >, by Theorem 2.3 of [12]\nIn [12] it was shown that, over fields of characteristic zero, U is modular\nin L if and only if it is sm in L. This result does not extend to all fields\nof characteristic three, as we show next. Recall that a simple Lie algebra is\nsplit if it has a splitting Cartan subalgebra H; that is, if the characteristic\nroots of adLh are in F for every h \u2208 H. Otherwise we say that it is non-split.\nProposition 2.2 Let L be a Lie algebra of dimension greater than three\nover an arbitrary field F , and suppose that every two linearly independent\nelements of L generate a three-dimensional non-split simple Lie algebra.\nThen there are maximal subalgebras M1, M2 of L such that M1 \u2229M2 = 0.\nProof: This is proved in Proposition 4 of [8].\nExample\nLet G be the algebra constructed by Gein in Example 2 of [7]. This is a\nseven-dimensional Lie algebra over a certain perfect field F of characteristic\nthree. In G every linearly independent pair of elements generate a three-\ndimensional non-split simple Lie algebra. It follows from Proposition 2.2\nabove that there are two maximal subalgebrasM , N in G such thatM\u2229N =\n0. Choose any 0 6= a \u2208 M . Then < a,N > \u2229M = M , but < N \u2229M,a >=\nFa, so Fa is not a modular subalgebra of L. However, it is easy to see that\nall atoms of G are sm in G.\nA subalgebra Q of L is called a quasi-ideal of L if [Q,V ] \u2286 Q+V for every\nsubspace V of L. It is easy to see that quasi-ideals of L are always semi-\nmodular subalgebras of L. When L is solvable the semi-modular subalgebras\nof L are precisely the quasi-ideals of L, as the next result, which is based on\nTheorem 1.1 of [15], shows.\nTheorem 2.3 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra over an arbitrary field F and\nlet U be a proper subalgebra of L. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) U is modular in L;\n(ii) U is sm in L; and\n(iii) U is a quasi-ideal of L.\n3\nProof: (i) \u21d2 (ii) : This is straightforward.\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii) : Let L be a solvable Lie algebra of smallest dimension\ncontaining a subalgebra U which is sm in L but is not a quasi-ideal of\nL. Then U is maximal and modular in L, by Lemma 2.1, and UL = 0. Let\nA be a minimal ideal of L. Then L = U +A. Moreover, U \u2229A is an ideal of\nL, since A is abelian, whence U \u2229A = 0 and L = U \u2295A. Now U is covered\nby < U,A > so A covers U \u2229A = 0. This yields that dimA = 1 and so U is\na quasi-ideal of L, a contradiction.\n(iii) \u21d2 (i) : This is straightforward.\nCorollary 2.4 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra over an arbitrary field F and\nlet U be a core-free sm subalgebra of L. Then dim(U) = 1 and L is almost\nabelian.\nProof: This follows from Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 3.6 of [1].\nWe now consider the case when L is not necessarily solvable. First we\nshall need the following result concerning psl3(F ).\nProposition 2.5 Let F be a field of characteristic 3 and let L = psl3(F ).\nThen L has no maximal sm subalgebra.\nProof: Let Eij be the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix that has 1 in the (i, j)-position and 0\nelsewhere, and denote by Eij the canonical image of Eij \u2208 sl3(F ) in psl3(F ).\nPut e\u22123 = E23, e\u22122 = E31, e\u22121 = E12, e0 = E11 \u2212 E22, e1 = E21, e2 = E13,\ne3 = E32. Then e\u22123, e\u22122, e\u22121, e0, e1, e2, e3 is a basis for psl3(F ) with\n[e0, ei] = ei if i > 0, [e0, ei] = \u2212ei if i < 0, [e\u2212i, ej ] = \u03b4ije0 if i, j > 0 and\n[ei, ej ] = e\u2212k for every cyclic permutation (i, j, k) of (1, 2, 3) or (\u22123,\u22122,\u22121).\nPut Bi,j = Fe0 + Fei + Fej for each non-zero i, j. If i, j are of opposite\nsign then Bi,j is a subalgebra, every maximal subalgebra of which is two\ndimensional.\nLet M be a maximal sm subalgebra of L. For each i, j of opposite sign,\nif Bi,j 6\u2286 M then M \u2229 Bi,j is two dimensional. Since M is at most five-\ndimensional, by considering the intersection with each of B1,\u22121, B2,\u22122 and\nB3,\u22123 it is easy to see that e0 \u2208 M . But then, considering B1,\u22121 again, we\nhave either e1 \u2208 M or e\u22121 \u2208 M . Suppose the former holds. Taking the\nintersection of M with B2,\u22123 shows that e\u22123 \u2208 M ; then with B2,\u22121 gives\ne2 \u2208 M ; next with B3,\u22122 gives e\u22122 \u2208 M ; finally with B3,\u22121 yields e3 \u2208 M .\n4\nBut then M = L, a contradiction. A similar contradiction is easily obtained\nif we assume that e\u22121 \u2208M .\nLet (Lp, [p], \u03b9) be any finite-dimensional p-envelope of L. If S is a sub-\nalgebra of L we denote by Sp the restricted subalgebra of Lp generated by\n\u03b9(S). Then the (absolute) toral rank of S in L, TR(S,L), is defined by\nTR(S,L) = max{dim(T ) : T is a torus of (Sp + Z(Lp))\/Z(Lp)}.\nThis definition is independent of the p-envelope chosen (see [11]). We write\nTR(L,L) = TR(L). Then, following the same line of proof, we have an\nextension of Lemma 2.1 of [16].\nLemma 2.6 Let L be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of\ncharacteristic p > 0 such that TR(L) \u2264 1. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) U is modular in L;\n(ii) U is sm in L; and\n(iii) U is a quasi-ideal of L.\nProof: We need only show that (ii) \u21d2 (iii). Let U be a sm subalgebra\nof L that is not a quasi-ideal of L. Then there is an x \u2208 L such that\n< U, x >6= U + Fx. We have that U is maximal and modular in < U, x >,\nby Lemma 2.1, and < U, x > is not solvable, by Theorem 2.3. Furthermore\nTR(< U, x >) \u2264 TR(L) \u2264 1, by Proposition 2.2 of [11], and < U, x > is\nnot nilpotent so TR(< U, x >) 6= 0, by Theorem 4.1 of [11], which yields\nTR(< U, x >) = 1. We may therefore suppose that U is maximal and\nmodular in L, of codimension greater than one in L, and that TR(L) = 1.\nPut L\u221e =\n\u22c2\nn\u22651 L\nn. Suppose first that R(L\u221e) 6\u2264 U . Then U \u2229R(L\u221e) is\nmaximal and modular in the solvable subalgebra R(L\u221e), so U \u2229R(L\u221e) has\ncodimension one in R(L\u221e). Since U is maximal in L we have L = U+R(L\u221e)\nand so dim(L\/U) = 1, which is a contradiction. This yields that R(L\u221e) \u2264\nU . Moreover, L\u221e 6\u2264 U , since this would imply that U\/L\u221e is maximal in\nthe nilpotent algebra L\/L\u221e, giving dim(L\/U) = 1, a contradiction again.\nIt follows that (U \u2229 L\u221e)\/R(L\u221e) is modular and maximal in L\u221e\/R(L\u221e).\nBut now L\u221e\/R(L\u221e) is simple, by Theorem 2.3 of [17], and 1 = TR(L) \u2265\nTR(L\u221e, L) \u2265 TR(L\u221e\/R(L\u221e)) by section 2 of [11], so TR(L\u221e\/R(L\u221e)) = 1.\nThis implies that\np 6= 2, L\u221e\/R(L\u221e) \u2208 {sl2(F ),W (1 : 1),H(2 : 1)(1)} if p > 3\n5\nand L\u221e\/R(L\u221e) \u2208 {sl2(F ), psl3(F )} if p = 3,\nby [9] and [10].\nNow H(2 : 1)(1) has no modular and maximal subalgebras, by Corollary\n3.5 of [15]; likewise psl3(F ) by Proposition 2.5. It follows that L\u221e\/R(L\u221e)\nis isomorphic to W (1 : 1), which has just one proper modular subalgebra\nand this has codimension one, by Proposition 2.3 of [15], or to sl2(F ) in\nwhich the proper modular subalgebras clearly have codimension one. Hence\ndim(L\u221e\/(U \u2229 L\u221e) = 1. Since L = U + L\u221e we conclude that dim(L\/U) =\ndim(L\u221e\/(U \u2229 L\u221e) = 1. This contradiction gives the claimed result.\nWe then have the following extension of Theorem 2.2 of [16]. The proof\nis virtually as given in [16], but as the restriction to characteristic > 7 has\nbeen removed the details need to be checked carefully. The proof is therefore\nincluded for the convenience of the reader.\nTheorem 2.7 Let L be a restricted Lie algebra over an algebraically closed\nfield F of characteristic p > 0, and let U be a proper subalgebra of L. Then\nthe following are equivalent:\n(i) U is modular in L;\n(ii) U is sm in L; and\n(iii) U is a quasi-ideal of L.\nProof: As before it suffices show that (ii) \u21d2 (iii). Let U be a sm subalgebra\nof L that is not a quasi-ideal of L. Then there is an x \u2208 L such that\n< U, x >6= U + Fx. First note that < U, x > is a restricted subalgebra of\nL. For, suppose not and pick z \u2208< U, x >p such that z \/\u2208< U, x >. Since\n< U, x > is an ideal of < U, x >p we have that [z, U ] \u2264 < U, x > \u2229 < U, z >.\nBut U is maximal in < U, z >, by Lemma 2.1, and so < U, x > \u2229 < U, z >=\nU , giving [z, U ] \u2264 U . But U is self-idealizing, by Lemma 1.5 of [12], so\nz \u2208 U . This contradiction proves the claim. So we may as well assume that\nL =< U, x >. Moreover, U is restricted since it is self-idealizing, whence\n(UL)p \u2264 U . As (UL)p is an ideal of L we have that UL = (UL)p. It follows\nthat L\/UL is also restricted. We may therefore assume that U is a core-free\nmodular and maximal subalgebra of L of codimension greater than one in\nL.\nNow L is spanned by the centralizers of tori of maximal dimension, by\nCorollary 3.11 of [17], so there is such a torus T with CL(T ) 6\u2264 U . Let\nL = CL(T ) \u2295\n\u2211\nL\u03b1(T ) be the decomposition of L into eigenspaces with\n6\nrespect to T . We have that CL(T ) is a Cartan subalgebra of L, by Theorem\n2.14 of [17]. It follows from the nilpotency of CL(T ) and the modularity of\nU that U \u2229 CL(T ) has codimension one in CL(T ).\nNow let L(\u03b1) =\n\u2211\ni\u2208P Li\u03b1(T ), where P is the prime field of F , be the\n1-section of L corresponding to a non-zero root \u03b1. From the modularity\nof U we see that U \u2229 L(\u03b1) is a modular and maximal subalgebra of L(\u03b1).\nSince U is core-free and self-idealizing, Z(L) = 0. But then TR(T,L) =\nTR(L), since T is a maximal torus, whence TR(L(\u03b1)) \u2264 1, by Theorem 2.6\nof [11]. It follows from Lemma 2.6 that M \u2229 L(\u03b1) is a quasi-ideal of L(\u03b1).\nAs U \u2229 L(\u03b1) is maximal in L(\u03b1), we have that dim(L(\u03b1)\/(U \u2229 L(\u03b1))) \u2264 1\nand L(\u03b1) = U \u2229 L(\u03b1) + CL(T ). This yields that L = U + CL(T ) and hence\nthat dim(L\/U) = dim(CL(T )\/(U \u2229CL(T ))) = 1, a contradiction. The result\nfollows.\nWe shall say that the Lie algebra L has the one-and-a-half generation\nproperty if, given any 0 6= x \u2208 L, there is an element y \u2208 L such that\n< x, y >= L. Then we have the following result.\nTheorem 2.8 Let L be a Lie algebra, over any field F , which has the one-\nand-a-half generation property. Then every sm subalgebra of L is a modular\nmaximal subalgebra of L.\nProof: Let U be a sm subalgebra of L and let 0 6= u \u2208 U . Then there is an\nelement x \u2208 L such that L =< u, x >=< U, x >. It follows from Lemma\n2.1 that U is modular in L.\nCorollary 2.9 Let L be a Lie algebra over an infinite field F of charac-\nteristic different from 2, 3 which is a form of a classical simple Lie algebra.\nThen every sm subalgebra of L is a modular maximal subalgebra of L.\nProof: Under the given hypotheses L has the one-and-a-half generation prop-\nerty, by Theorem 2.2.3 and section 1.2.2 of [3], or by [5].\nWe also have the following analogue of a result of Varea from [15].\nCorollary 2.10 Let F be an infinite perfect field of characteristic p > 2,\nand assume that pn 6= 3. Then the subalgebra W (1 : n)0 is the unique sm\nsubalgebra of W (1 : n).\nProof: Let L = W (1 : n) and let \u2126 be the algebraic closure of F . Then\nL\u2297F\u2126 is simple and has the one-and-a-half generation property, by Theorem\n7\n4.4.8 of [3]. It follows that L has the one-and-a-half generation property (see\nsection 1.2.2 of [3]). Let U be a sm subalgebra of L. Then U is modular and\nmaximal in L by Theorem 2.8. Suppose that U 6= L0. Then L = U + L0\nand U \u2229 L0 is maximal in L0. But L0 is supersolvable (see Lemma 2.1 of\n[13] for instance) so dim(L0\/(L0 \u2229 U)) = 1. It follows that dim(L\/U) =\ndim(L0\/(L0 \u2229 U)) = 1, whence U = L0, which is a contradiction.\n3 Semi-modular atoms\nWe say that L is almost abelian if L = L2 \u2295 Fx with adx acting as the\nidentity map on the abelian ideal L2. A \u00b5-algebra is a non-solvable Lie\nalgebra in which every proper subalgebra is one dimensional. A subalgebra\nU of a Lie algebra L is a strong ideal (respectively, strong quasi-ideal) of L if\nevery one-dimensional subalgebra of U is an ideal (respectively, quasi-ideal)\nof L; it is modular* in L if it satisfies a dualised version of the modularity\nconditions, namely\n< U,B > \u2229C =< B,U \u2229 C > for all subalgebras B \u2286 C,\nand\n< U \u2229B,C >=< B,C > \u2229U for all subalgebras C \u2286 U.\nExample\nLet K be the three-dimensional Lie algebra with basis a, b, c and multi-\nplication [a, b] = c , [b, c] = b , [a, c] = a over a field of characteristic two.\nThen K has a unique one-dimensional quasi-ideal, namely Fc. Thus for\neach 0 6= u \u2208 Fc and k \u2208 K \\ Fc we have that < u, k > is two dimensional.\nHowever K is not almost abelian. In fact K is simple, Fc is core-free and is\nthe Frattini subalgebra of K, and so any two linearly independent elements\nnot in Fc generate K.\nWe shall need a result from [4]. However, because of the above example,\nthere is a (slight) error in three results in this paper. The error comes from\nan incorrect use of Theorem 3.6 of [1]. The three corrected results are as\nfollows:\nLemma 3.1 (Lemma 2.2 of [4]) If Q is a strong quasi-ideal of L, then Q\nis a strong ideal of L, or L is almost abelian, or F has characteristic two,\nL = K and Q = Fc.\n8\nProof: Assume that Q is a strong quasi-ideal and that there exists q \u2208 Q\nsuch that Fq is not an ideal of L. Then Theorem 3.6 of [1] gives that L is\nalmost abelian, or F has characteristic two, L = K and Q = Fc. The result\nfollows.\nThe proof of the following result is the same as the original.\nProposition 3.2 (Proposition 2.3 of [4]) Let Q be a proper quasi-ideal of\na Lie algebra L which is modular* in L. Then Q is a strong quasi-ideal and\nso is given by Lemma 3.1.\nLemma 3.3 (Lemma 4.1 of [4]) Let L be a Lie algebra over an arbitrary\nfield F . Let U be a core-free subalgebra of L such that < u, z > is either two\ndimensional or a \u00b5-algebra for every 0 6= u \u2208 U and z \u2208 L \\ U . Then one\nof the following holds:\n(i) L is almost abelian;\n(ii) < u, z > is a \u00b5-algebra for every 0 6= u \u2208 U ; and z \u2208 L \\ U\n(iii) F has characteristic two, L = K and Fu = Fc.\nProof: This is the same as the original proof except that the following should\nbe inserted at the end of sentence six: \u201cor charF = 2 and L = K\u201d.\nUsing the above we now have the following result.\nLemma 3.4 Suppose that Fu is sm in L but not an ideal of L. Then either\n(i) L is almost abelian; or\n(ii) < u, x > is a \u00b5-algebra for every x \u2208 L \\ Fu.\n(iii) F has characteristic two, L = K and Fu = Fc\nProof: Pick any x \u2208 L \\ Fu. Then Fu is maximal in < u, x >, by Lemma\n2.1. Now let M be a maximal subalgebra of < u, x >. If u \u2208 M then\nM = Fu. So suppose that u 6\u2208 M . Then Fu is a maximal subalgebra of\n< u, x >=< u,M >, whence Fu \u2229M = 0 is maximal in M , since Fu is lm.\nIt follows that every maximal subalgebra of < u, x > is one dimensional.\nThe claimed result now follows from Lemma 3.3.\nWe shall need the following result concerning \u2018one-and-a-half generation\u2019\nof rank one simple Lie algebras over infinite fields of characteristic 6= 2, 3.\n9\nTheorem 3.5 Let L be a rank one simple Lie algebra over an infinite field\nF of characteristic 6= 2, 3 and let Fx be a Cartan subalgebra of L. Then\nthere is an element y \u2208 L such that < x, y >= L.\nProof: Since L is rank one simple it is central simple. Let \u2126 be the algebraic\nclosure of F and put L\u2126 = L \u2297F \u2126, and so on. Then L\u2126 is simple and \u2126x\nis a Cartan subalgebra of L\u2126. Let\nL\u2126 = \u2126x\u2295\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6\n(L\u2126)\u03b1\nbe the decomposition of L\u2126 into its root spaces relative to \u2126x. Then, with\nthe given restrictions on the characteristic of the field, every root space\n(L\u2126)\u03b1 is one dimensional (see [2]).\nLet M be a maximal subalgebra of L containing x. Then M\u2126 is a\nsubalgebra of L\u2126 and \u2126x \u2286 M\u2126. So, M\u2126 decomposes into root spaces\nrelative to \u2126x,\nM\u2126 = \u2126x\u2295\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206\n(M\u2126)\u03b1.\nWe have that \u2206 \u2286 \u03a6 and (M\u2126)\u03b1 \u2286 (L\u2126)\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206. As (L\u2126)\u03b1 is one\ndimensional for every \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6, we have (M\u2126)\u03b1 = (L\u2126)\u03b1 for every \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206.\nHence there are only finitely many maximal subalgebras of L containing x:\nM1, . . . ,Mr say. Since F is infinite, \u222ari=1Mi 6= L, so there is an element\ny \u2208 L such that y 6\u2208Mi for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. But now < x, y >= L, as claimed.\nIf U is a subalgebra of L, then the normaliser of U in L is the set\nNL(U) = {x \u2208 L : [x,U ] \u2286 U}.\nWe can now give the following characterisation of one-dimensional semi-\nmodular subalgebras of Lie algebras over fields of characteristic 6= 2, 3.\nTheorem 3.6 Let L be a Lie algebra over a field F , of characteristic 6= 2, 3\nif F is infinite. Then Fu is sm in L if and only if one of the following holds:\n(i) Fu is an ideal of L;\n(ii) L is almost abelian and ad u acts as a non-zero scalar on L2;\n(iii) L is a \u00b5-algebra.\n10\nProof: It is easy to check that (i), (ii), or (iii) hold then Fu is sm in L. So\nsuppose that Fu is sm in L, but that (i), (ii) do not hold. First we claim\nthat L is simple.\nSuppose not, and let A be a minimal ideal of L. If u \u2208 A, choose any b \u2208\nL \\ A. Then < u, b > \u2229A is an ideal of < u, b >. Since 0 6= u \u2208< u, b > \u2229A\nand b 6\u2208 A, < u, b > cannot be a \u00b5-algebra. But then L is almost abelian,\nby Lemma 3.4, a contradiction. So u 6\u2208 A. By Lemma 3.3 of [12], ua = \u03bba\nfor all a \u2208 A and some \u03bb \u2208 F . But now Fu + Fa is a two-dimensional\nsubalgebra of < u, a >, a \u00b5-algebra, which is impossible. Hence L is simple.\nNow Fu is um in L and not an ideal of L, so NL(Fu) = Fu, by Lemma\n1.5 of [12]. Hence Fu is a Cartan subalgebra of L, and L is rank one simple.\nNow F cannot be finite, since there are no \u00b5-algebras over finite fields, by\nCorollary 3.2 of [6]. Hence F is infinite. But then there is an element y \u2208 L\nsuch that < u, y >= L, by Theorem 3.5, and L is a \u00b5-algebra. The result is\nestablished.\nAs a corollary to this we have a result of Varea, namely Corollary 2.3 of\n[14].\nCorollary 3.7 (Varea) Let L be a Lie algebra over a perfect field F , of\ncharacteristic 6= 2, 3 if F is infinite. If Fu is modular in L but not an ideal\nof L then L is either almost abelian or three-dimensional non-split simple.\nProof: This follows from Theorem 3.6 and the fact that with the stated\nrestrictions on F the only \u00b5-algebras are three-dimensional non-split simple\n(Proposition 1 of [7]).\n4 Semi-modular subalgebras of higher dimension\nFirst we consider two-dimensional semi-modular subalgebras. We have the\nfollowing analogue of Theorem 1.6 of [15].\nTheorem 4.1 Let L be a Lie algebra over a perfect field F of characteristic\ndifferent from 2, 3, and let U be a two-dimensional core-free sm subalgebra\nof L. Then L \u223c= sl2(F ).\nProof: If U is modular then the result follows from Theorem 1.6 of [15], so we\ncan assume that U is not a quasi-ideal of L. Thus, there is an element x \u2208 L\nsuch that < U, x >6= U +Fx. Put V =< U, x >. Then UV = U implies that\n< U, x >= U + Fx, a contradiction; if UV = 0 then V \u223c= sl2(F ) by Lemma\n11\n2.1 and Theorem 1.6 of [15], and < U, x >= U + Fx, a contradiction. It\nfollows that dim(UV ) = 1. Put UV = Fu. Now dim(U\/UV ) = 1 and V\/UV\nis three-dimensional non-split simple, by Theorem 3.6 and Proposition 1 of\n[7]. Thus V = Fu \u2295 S, where S is three-dimensional non-split simple, by\nLemma 1.4 of [15], and Fu, S are ideals of V .\nNow we claim that 0 6= Z(< U, y >) \u2286 U for every y \u2208 L \\ U . We\nhave shown this above if < U, y >6= U + Fy. So suppose that < U, y >=\nU +Fy. Then < U, y > is three dimensional and not simple (since U is two\ndimensional and abelian), and so solvable. Then, by using Corollary 2.4,\nwe have that U contains a one-dimensional ideal K of U + Fy such that\n(U + Fy)\/K is two-dimensional non-abelian, and K = Z(< U, y >).\nSince U is maximal in < U, x > we have < U, x > 6= L. Pick y \u2208\nL\\ < U, x >. Then 0 6= Z(< U, x + y >) \u2286 U by the above. Assume that\nZ(< u, x >) 6= Z(< U, y >). Then U = Z(< u, x >) \u2295 Z(< U, y >). Let\n0 6= z \u2208 Z(< U, x + y >) and write z = z1 + z2 where z1 \u2208 Z(< U, x >),\nz2 \u2208 Z(< U, y >). Then 0 = [z, (x + y)] = [z2, x] + [z1, y], so [z2, x] =\n\u2212[z1, y]. Now, if z1 = 0, then [z2, x] = 0, whence z2 \u2208 Z(< u, x >)\u2229\nZ(< U, y >), a contradiction. Similarly, if z2 = 0, then [z1, y] = 0, whence\nz2 \u2208 Z(< u, x >) \u2229 Z(< U, y >), a contradiction again. Hence z1, z2 6= 0.\nSince z1, z2 \u2208 U we deduce that [z1, y] = \u2212[z2, x] \u2208< u, x > \u2229 < U, y >= U .\nThus y \u2208 NL(U) = U , a contradiction. It follows that Z(< U, x >) =\nZ(< U, y >) for all y \u2208 L, whence [L,Z(< U, x >)] = 0 and Z(< U, x >) is\nan ideal of L, contradicting the fact that U is core-free.\nNext we establish analogues of two results of Varea from [15].\nTheorem 4.2 Let L be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field F of\ncharacteristic p > 5. If U is a sm subalgebra of L such that U\/UL is solvable\nand dim(U\/UL) > 1, then U is modular in L, and hence L\/UL is isomorphic\nto sl2(F ) or to a Zassenhaus algebra.\nProof: Let L be a Lie algebra of minimal dimension having a sm subal-\ngebra U which is not modular in L, and such that U\/UL is solvable and\ndim(U\/UL) > 1. Then UL = 0 and U is solvable. Since U is not a quasi-ideal\nthere is an element x \u2208 L\\U such that S =< U, x >6= U+Fx. Let K = US .\nIf dim(U\/K) = 1 then S\/K is almost abelian, by Theorem 3.6, whence U is\na quasi-ideal of S, a contradiction. It follows that dim(U\/K) > 1. If U\/K\nis modular in S\/K then dim(S\/U) = 1, by Theorem 2.4 of [15], a contra-\ndiction. The minimality of L then implies that S = L. This yields that U\nis modular in L, by Lemma 2.1. This contradiction establishes the result.\n12\nWe say that the subalgebra U of L is split if adLx is split for all x \u2208 U ;\nthat is, if adLx has a Jordan decomposition into semisimple and nilpotent\nparts for all x \u2208 U .\nTheorem 4.3 Let L be a Lie algebra over a perfect field F of characteristic\np different from 2. If U is a sm subalgebra of L which is split and which con-\ntains the normaliser of each of its non-zero subalgebras, then U is modular,\nand one of the following holds:\n(i) L is almost abelian and dim(U) = 1;\n(ii) L \u223c= sl2(F ) and dim(U) = 2;\n(iii) L is a Zassenhaus algebra and U is its unique subalgebra of codimen-\nsion one in L.\nProof: Let L be a Lie algebra of minimal dimension having a sm subalgebra\nU which is split and which contains the normaliser of each of its non-zero\nsubalgebras, but which is not modular in L. Since U is not a quasi-ideal\nthere is an element x \u2208 L \\ U such that S =< U, x >6= U + Fx. If S 6= L\nthen U is modular in S, by the minimality of L. It follows from Theorem\n2.7 of [15] that U is a quasi-ideal of S, a contradiction. Hence S = L. Once\nagain we see that U is modular in L, by Lemma 2.1. This contradiction\nestablishes the result.\nReferences\n[1] R.K.Amayo, Quasi-ideals of Lie algebras, Proc. London Math.
