Memory and the Self in Autism 4\nMemory and the Self in Autism: A Review and Theoretical Framework\nAspects of memory and the self are intimately and bi-directionally related.  On the one \nhand, the ability to encode and retrieve personally significant memories arguably \npresupposes a concept of self (Howe & Courage, 1993).  On the other hand, one\u2019s sense \nof self is composed of one\u2019s memories of past personal experiences, as well as \nknowledge of one\u2019s traits and other personally relevant information (Conway & Pleydell-\nPearce, 2000; Wilson & Ross, 2003).  \nIt is widely accepted that there are different \u201ctypes\u201d of memory and that the self is \nnot a unitary construct.  In terms of long term memory, one of the major distinctions to \nhave been drawn is between episodic and semantic memory, which are thought to \ncomprise functionally distinct but interacting neuro-cognitive systems (Tulving, 2001).  \nEpisodic memories are memories of personally experienced events that occurred in a \nparticular place at a particular time.  They are uniquely associated with autonoetic \nawareness, a type of self-conscious awareness that allows one to mentally represent and \nbecome aware of one\u2019s continuing existence across subjective time.  By contrast, \nsemantic memories are memories of timeless, de-contextualised facts, and are \ncharacterised by noetic (knowing) rather than autonoetic (self-knowing) awareness \n(Wheeler, Stuss, & Tulving, 1997).    \nAutobiographical memory refers to memory for information pertaining to the self \nand is often considered to be synonymous with episodic memory (Gilboa, 2004).  \nHowever, the term \u201cepisodic\u201d refers to a distinct type of memory system, whereas the \nterm \u201cautobiographical\u201d refers to a particular type of memory content.  Indeed, both the \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 5\nepisodic and semantic systems are capable of processing autobiographical content (Klein, \nChan, & Loftus, 1999; Levine, 2004).  Not all episodic memories are autobiographical \n(i.e., self-relevant) in nature and, likewise, not all autobiographical (self-relevant) \nmemories are episodic in nature.  It is therefore possible to distinguish between (a) \nautobiographical episodic memory (e.g., remembering what happened on one\u2019s first day \nof secondary school); (b) non-autobiographical episodic memory (e.g., remembering \nwhat was reported in the newspaper this morning); (c) autobiographical semantic \nknowledge (e.g., knowledge of one\u2019s date of birth or middle name); and (d) non-\nautobiographical semantic knowledge (e.g., knowledge of the boiling point of water).  \nWith the exception of non-autobiographical semantic knowledge, each of these types of \nmemory is arguably related to the self in some way.  \nAs stated above, the self is widely considered to be multifaceted (e.g., Lewis, \n1995; Neisser, 1988; Rochat, 2003).  Perhaps the most critical distinction is between the \nself as the subject of experience (the \u201cI\u201d) and the self as the object of experience (the\n\u201cme\u201d) (James, 1890).  Only when the self becomes the object of experience can one be \nascribed self-awareness.  Further refining this distinction, Butterworth (1995) argues that \n\u201cprimary\u201d self-awareness occurs when the self is the object of one\u2019s own perception, and \n\u201chigher-order\u201d self-awareness occurs when the self is the object of one\u2019s own cognition.  \nSuch higher-order self-awareness is often referred to as \u201cexplicit\u201d or \u201creflexive\u201d self-\nawareness.  A further key distinction, which cuts across the facets of self described \nabove, is between physical and psychological aspects of self (Gillihan & Farah, 2005).  \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 6\nThe Relationship Between Memory and the Self \nAccording to Tulving (2001), episodic memory is intimately related to the self.  \nHowever, it is important to consider which aspects of the self are likely to be involved\nand whether they are likely to be involved at the point of encoding or retrieval.  From a \ndevelopmental perspective, Howe and Courage (1993) have argued that the emergence of \nautobiographical episodic memory in early childhood is critically dependent upon the \ndevelopment of a self-concept (which is also frequently referred to in the literature as a \nrepresentational, categorical, or cognitive self).  The self-concept is typically regarded as \na set of beliefs about the self (e.g., I have brown hair, I am a child, I am silly, etc.) \n(Neisser, 1988), which is presumably based on semantic autobiographical knowledge.  \nHowe and Courage\u2019s argument revolves around the idea that the self-concept acts as a \nfixed referent \u2013 a sort of category \u2013 around which personally experienced event memories \ncan be organized.  Thus, without a self-concept it is not possible to encode self-relevant,\nautobiographical episodic memories.  The self-concept is said to reach a \u201ccritical mass\u201d at \naround 2 years of age, coinciding with the onset of rudimentary autobiographical episodic \nmemory, and indeed there is some evidence to support this claim (Harley & Reese, \n1999).  Once the self-concept has reached this critical mass, autobiographical episodic \nmemory is said to improve as the self-concept continues to become more elaborate and \nsophisticated.  \nIt might be argued that as well as requiring a self-concept at the point of encoding \n(in order to \u201ctag\u201d the memory as self-relevant), autobiographical episodic memory also \ninvolves the re-experiencing of the self as the object of experience (i.e., the \u201cme\u201d) at the \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 7\npoint of retrieval.  However, non-autobiographical episodic memory is unlikely to require \na self-concept at the point of encoding and may merely involve re-experiencing the self \nas the subject of experience (the \u201cI\u201d) at retrieval.  Take for example a typical recognition \nmemory task, in which one is presented with a list of words to study and then \nsubsequently asked to make old-new judgments about words presented in a test list \n(including both studied and unstudied words).  One may, for example, remember that the \nword \u201cred\u201d appeared on the study list and also that the word red appeared after the word \n\u201chouse\u201d.  This type of retrieval appears to involve the episodic system but encoding does \nnot seem to require a self-concept (since the memory does not need to be tagged as self-\nrelevant) and retrieval does not seem to involve re-experiencing the self as the object of \nexperience \u2013 merely re-experiencing the self as the subject of experience.  Thus, whereas \nautobiographical episodic memory necessarily requires a self-concept at encoding and \ninvolves re-experiencing the self as the object of experience at retrieval, non-\nautobiographical episodic memory does not require a self-concept at encoding and \ninvolves re-experiencing the self as the subject of experience at retrieval.  If this \ncharacterisation is correct then autonoetic or \u201cself-knowing\u201d awareness, which is \nconsidered to be the hallmark of episodic memory, differs qualitatively between \nautobiographical and non-autobiographical episodic memory.  \nThe development of a self-concept is unlikely to be the only factor to play a role \nin the development of autobiographical episodic memory (Nelson & Fivush, 2004).  For \nexample, developmental improvements in memory \u201cbinding\u201d are also likely to be \nimplicated in the development of autobiographical (and non-autobiographical) episodic \nmemory (Sluzenski, Newcombe, & Kovacs, 2006).  Given that episodic memories \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 8\ninvolve multiple features, the features comprising an episode must be linked together at \nencoding to form a coherent or \u201cbound\u201d representation (Chalfonte & Johnson, 1996).  \nThus, featural or relational binding plays a key role in episodic encoding.  \nCorrespondingly, episodic retrieval involves bringing multiple features together in order \nto re-construct a coherent event representation (Baddeley, 2000).  Through enabling the \nre-construction of past episodes, episodic memory binding may enable one to mentally \nre-experience past episodes and this may entail the ability to re-experience the self as the \nsubject or object of experience \u2013 i.e., allow one to become aware of a past state of self.  \nNevertheless, the development of a self-concept is likely to be a necessary (even if not a \nsufficient) step towards the emergence of autobiographical episodic memory.  \nThus, a rudimentary self-concept (based on autobiographical semantic \nknowledge), which becomes increasingly elaborate through the course of development, \nmay provide the foundations necessary for a child to gradually develop a collection of \nautobiographical episodic memories, enriching their self-knowledge base.  In turn, the \ndevelopment of autobiographical episodic memory supports the emergence of a new, \nmore sophisticated level of self-awareness \u2013 [temporally] extended self-awareness \n(Neisser, 1988).  A temporally extended self-concept encompasses representations of \npresent, past, and future states of self, and allows one to become aware of one\u2019s place in \nand continued existence through time (Povinelli, 2001).  Without a store of \nautobiographical episodic memories such a temporally extended self-representation \nwould not be possible (Povinelli, 2001).  Here, the bidirectional relationship between \nmemory and the self becomes apparent.  Given that the temporally extended self-concept\nincorporates multiple, alternative representations of self that must be understood as\nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 9\nalternative representations of the same enduring self, metarepresentation (Perner, 1991) \nmay also be a prerequisite.  \nNow that a theoretical framework for considering the typical relationship between \nmemory and the self is in place, it is possible to consider how this might be applied to the \ncase of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a disorder which a number of researchers have \nsuggested is characterised by diminished self-awareness (e.g., Frith, 2003; Hobson, 1990; \nRussell, 1997) and which is also characterised by a particular profile of strengths and \nweaknesses in memory (Ben Shalom, 2003; Bowler, Gaigg, & Lind, in press).  \nThe main body of this review is presented in four unequal parts.  First, is a main \nsection on \u2018The Self in ASD\u2019. This is followed by an extended main section on \u2018The \nSelf and Memory in ASD\u2019, subdivided into reviews of evidence relating to \n\u2018Autobiographical memory in ASD\u2019, \u2018The self-reference effect in ASD\u2019, and \u2018Memory \nfor the actions of self and other in ASD\u2019. There follows a short main section on \u2018Non-\nAutobiographical Episodic Memory in ASD\u2019 and a \u2018Conclusions\u2019 section.\nThe Self in ASD\nWhen considering the self in ASD, it is important to consider which aspects are typical \nand which are atypical.  It seems implausible to suggest that individuals with ASD do not \nhave subjective experiences (i.e., lack an \u201cI\u201d, in James\u2019, 1890, terms), although it is quite \npossible that those subjective experiences are qualitatively distinct from those of typical \nindividuals.  It should be noted, however, that Powell and Jordan (1996) have argued that \nASD involves a deficit in developing an \"experiencing self\", which seems to be a related \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 10\nnotion.  It is far more probable that individuals with ASD have difficulties with becoming \nself-aware (i.e., deficits in the \u201cme\u201d).  Precisely which aspects of self-awareness \n(primary or higher-order, physical or psychological) are problematic in ASD should also \nbe considered.  \nPrimary self-awareness in ASD: physical and psychological aspects\nRecent evidence seems to indicate that individuals with ASD have intact primary self-\nawareness, at least in the physical domain.  For example, Williams and Happ\u00e9 (2009a) \nfound that children with ASD (of mixed intellectual ability) were able to discriminate \nbetween internally (i.e., self) and externally caused changes in their perceptual experience \nas effectively as comparison children.  Similar results have been observed amongst high-\nfunctioning1 adults (David et al., 2008).  These findings indicate that individuals with \nASD are able to become perceptually aware of physical aspects of themselves.  However, \ndifficulties with reciprocal social engagement in ASD seem to suggest that they have \ndiminished primary awareness of psychological (or interpersonal) aspects of self \n(Hobson, 1990; Neisser, 1988; Tomasello, 1995).   \nHigher-order self-awareness in ASD: physical and psychological aspects\nThe mark test of mirror self-recognition (Amsterdam, 1972; Gallup, 1970) is probably the \nmost commonly used test of higher-order self-awareness.  The traditional version of the \n                                                \n1 The terms \u201chigh-functioning\u201d and \u201clow-functioning\u201d will be used to refer to individuals with full scale \nIQs of \u2265 70 and < 70, respectively.  \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 11\ntask involves surreptitiously marking a child\u2019s face with a spot of rouge and subsequently \nassessing their reaction upon seeing their reflection.  Here, mark-directed behaviour (i.e., \ntouching the mark) is taken as evidence of self-recognition.  Such behaviour is shown by \ntypically developing children at a mean age of 18 months (Anderson, 1983; Courage, \nEdison, & Howe, 2004).  Although there is some debate over exactly what the mark test \nmeasures (Hobson, 1990; Mitchell, 1997), it is generally agreed that mark-directed \nbehaviour demonstrates that a child has a mental representation of what they typically \nlook like \u2013 they have at least a rudimentary physical self-concept, which can become the \nobject of their consciousness (Amsterdam, 1972; Neisser, 1995; Nielsen, Suddendorf, & \nSlaughter, 2006).  This implies higher-order self-awareness of physical aspects of self.  \nFour studies have assessed mirror self-recognition in ASD, in each case \nemploying children with ages ranging from 3.5 to 12.7 years (Dawson & McKissick, \n1984; Ferrari & Matthews, 1983; Neuman & Hill, 1978; Spiker & Ricks, 1984).  In three \nof these studies, the children appear to have had intellectual disability (in the fourth\nstudy, the intellectual ability level was not specified)2.  In each of these studies, the \nmajority of children with ASD (between 53% and 86% across studies) showed mirror \nself-recognition.  Although a minority of participants in all the studies failed to show \nmark-directed behaviour, given that appropriate control groups and intelligence measures \nwere not included, it is unclear whether this failure was due to an ASD-specific deficit or \nintellectual disability. Indeed, these studies included children with severe to profound \nintellectual disability, who may have had mental ages of less than 18 months.  In future \n                                                \n2 Dawson and McKissick\u2019s (1984) sample had a mean IQ of 57; Ferrari and Matthews\u2019 (1983) sample was \ndescribed as severely to profoundly mentally retarded; Neuman and Hill (1978) did not specify the \nintellectual ability level of their sample; Spiker and Ricks\u2019 (1984) sample were said to have severely \nimpaired language.  \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 12\nstudies, it will be important to establish whether children with ASD are impaired relative \nto mental age rather than merely chronological age.  \nAlthough the evidence is not clear-cut, mirror self-recognition appears to be a \nrelative strength for individuals with ASD (even seemingly low-functioning individuals).  \nThis suggests that they have higher-order physical self-awareness.  Further supporting \nthis suggestion, studies have shown that children with ASD (both high-functioning and \nmixed ability) do not significantly differ from age and verbal ability matched comparison \nchildren in terms of their ability to recognise delayed video images of themselves (Lind \n& Bowler, 2009a).  Such findings may be taken as evidence of intact (higher-order) \ntemporally extended physical self-awareness but do not necessarily imply intact (higher-\norder) temporally extended psychological self-awareness (see Lind & Bowler, 2009a).   \nEvidence from a number of sources suggests that individuals with ASD have \ndiminished higher-order awareness of psychological aspects of self.  For example, it is \nwidely acknowledged that children with ASD have difficulty using first person pronouns \nsuch as \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d (Jordan, 1996; Lee, Hobson, & Chiat, 1994; Lind & Bowler, \n2009a).   Moreover, individuals with ASD (even high-functioning individuals) also show \ndiminished conscious awareness of their own emotions (Ben Shalom et al., 2006; Silani \net al., 2008), mental states (Williams & Happ\u00e9, in press, 2009b), and autistic traits \n(Johnson, Filliter, & Murphy, 2009).  Together, these findings suggest that children with \nASD may have impoverished or atypical higher-order psychological self-awareness \n(alongside comparatively intact higher-order physical self-awareness).  \nIt seems likely that deficits in higher-order psychological self-awareness are a \ndownstream consequence of the social and communication impairments that characterise \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 13\nASD.  Social and communication impairments significantly reduce opportunities for \neffective social engagement and consequently opportunities to acquire psychological self-\nknowledge (Neisser, 1988).  However, such impairments would be unlikely to impact \nupon opportunities to acquire physical self-knowledge.  \nIn summary, individuals with ASD appear to have impaired self-awareness at \nboth the primary and higher-order levels in the psychological, but not physical, domain.  \nThis would seem to imply that they lack self-knowledge in the psychological domain and \ntherefore have less elaborate self-concepts than individuals without ASD. If this is the \ncase, it should become apparent in studies of autobiographical semantic knowledge \n(which arguably directly taps the self-concept) and autobiographical episodic memory \n(which arguably relies on a self-concept).  The following sections review studies which\nshed light on the interrelation between memory and the self in ASD.  Studies of \nautobiographical (semantic and episodic) memory, the self-reference effect, memory for \nthe actions of self versus other, and (non-autobiographical) episodic memory are \nconsidered.  \nThe Self and Memory in ASD\nAutobiographical memory in ASD\nGoddard, Howlin, Dritschel, and Patel (2007) assessed autobiographical memory in 37 \nhigh-functioning young adults with ASD, and 39 typical comparison adults, matched for \nage, verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and full scale IQ (FSIQ), using a cueing \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 14\ntask and a social problem solving task.  The cueing task involved presenting a series of \ncue words (e.g., \u201cleisure\u201d), designed to elicit memories of specific past personal \nexperiences.  The social problem solving task involved presenting short stories describing \nvarious social problems (e.g., falling out with friends).  In this task, participants were first \nof all asked to describe the sequence of steps required to solve the problem at hand, in \norder to achieve a specified goal (e.g., how to make up with friends), and subsequently \nasked to report any thoughts or images that came to them during the problem solving \nprocess.  In this respect, the task incidentally provided an opportunity to report specific \npast personal experiences.\nIt was found that in the cueing task, participants with ASD generated significantly \nfewer specific event memories than comparison participants, and were also significantly \nslower at doing so.  With respect to the social problem solving task, it was found that \nalthough participants within each group were equally likely to report thoughts\/images \nfollowing the problem solving activity, these thoughts\/images were significantly less \nlikely to comprise memories of specific personal experiences within the ASD group than \nwithin the comparison group.  These results suggest that high-functioning adults with \nASD have impaired autobiographical episodic memory.   \nFurther evidence for an ASD-specific impairment in autobiographical episodic \nmemory is provided by a study of children\u2019s narrative abilities (Losh & Capps, 2003).  \nParticipants were asked to describe past personal experiences (e.g., \u201cCan you tell me a \nspecific time you went on vacation?\u201d) and also to describe the ongoing events in a picture \nbook.  When compared to age and verbal IQ matched typically developing children, high-\nfunctioning children with ASD were found to have few difficulties with narrating the \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 15\nbook, but showed significantly impoverished narratives of personal experiences.  The \nchildren with ASD produced a greater number of bizarre or irrelevant responses than \ncomparison children, and were more heavily reliant on prompting.  The fact that (in this \nparticular study) participants with ASD did not have difficulty in narrating the picture \nbook suggests that it was not their narrative skills per se that were the limiting factor in \nreporting personal experiences but rather the (autobiographical episodic) content of what \nthey were attempting to describe.  \nA recent study by Lind and Bowler (2009b, under review) indicates that \nindividuals with ASD not only demonstrate impaired autobiographical episodic memory\nbut also impaired autobiographical episodic future thinking.  Episodic future thinking (or \n\u201cprospection\u201d) involves mentally projecting oneself into the future in order to \u201cpre-\nexperience\u201d a possible future episode, and is thought to be at least partially underpinned \nby the episodic memory system (Suddendorf & Corballis, 1997; Wheeler et al., 1997).  \nIndeed, recent neuropsychological (Spreng, Mar, & Kim, 2009) and behavioural (Busby \n& Suddendorf, 2005; D'Argembeau, Raffard, & Van der Linden, 2008) evidence supports \nthis hypothesis.  Lind and Bowler asked 14 high-functioning adults with ASD and 14 \ntypical comparison adults (who were matched for age, VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ) to try to \nremember a series of events that happened to them in the past and imagine a series of\nevents that might happen to them in the future.  It was found that participants with ASD \nremembered and imagined significantly fewer specific past and future experiences than \ncomparison participants, suggesting that both autobiographical episodic memory and\nfuture thinking are impaired in ASD.  \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 16\nThe studies described above demonstrate that autobiographical episodic memory \nand future thinking are diminished in ASD, but what about autobiographical semantic \nknowledge?  Klein et al. (1999) report a case study of R.J., a 21-year-old high-\nfunctioning individual with ASD.  They found that R.J. had detailed semantic knowledge \nof his personality traits but had great difficulty in generating episodic memories of \noccasions when he had demonstrated those traits.  For instance, although he knew that he \nwas friendly, when asked to recall a particular time when he had been friendly he \nencountered severe difficulties.  In contrast to three typical individuals (with \nchronological ages similar to R.J.\u2019s mental age), who generated autobiographical episodic \nmemories 100% of the time, R.J. could only generate such recollections 20% of the time.  \nThus, R.J. appeared to possess intact autobiographical semantic knowledge but impaired \nautobiographical episodic memory.  Although this represents a potentially important \nfinding, results from such case studies do not necessarily generalise.  However, two \nrecent studies have sought to further investigate both autobiographical semantic \nknowledge and autobiographical episodic memory in ASD.     \nCrane and Goddard (2008) compared the performance of 15 high-functioning \nadults with ASD and 15 typical comparison adults (who were matched for age, VIQ, PIQ, \nand FSIQ) on autobiographical (a) interview, (b) fluency, and (c) narrative tasks.  In the \nautobiographical interview, autobiographical episodic memory and autobiographical \nsemantic knowledge were assessed with questions such as, \u201cCan you tell me something \nthat happened while you were at primary school that stands out in your mind?\u201d and \u201cCan \nyou tell me the names of two of your teachers from primary school?\u201d respectively.  The \nautobiographical fluency task involved asking participants to generate as many events \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 17\n(measuring autobiographical episodic memory) and people\u2019s names (measuring \nautobiographical semantic knowledge), from specified lifetime periods, as possible in a \n90 second period.  Letter and category fluency were also assessed.  The autobiographical \nnarrative task involved questions such as \u201cWhat did you do for your last birthday?\u201d \ndesigned to elicit detailed descriptions of autobiographical episodic memories.  The \nresults from the interview task indicated no significant group differences in either \nautobiographical episodic memory or autobiographical semantic knowledge.  However, \non the fluency task the ASD group performed significantly less well, specifically on the \nautobiographical episodic memory element.  There were no significant group differences \nin performance on either the autobiographical semantic knowledge element or the letter \nor category fluency tasks (ruling out generativity-based explanations of the findings).  \nWith respect to the narrative task, no qualitative group differences were observed, \nalthough the ASD group were found to produce significantly fewer specific\nautobiographical episodic memories.  As a whole, the results of this study suggest that \nautobiographical episodic memory is impaired in high-functioning adults with ASD, \nwhilst autobiographical semantic knowledge is intact.  \nBruck, London, Landa, and Goodman (2007) assessed these two aspects of \nmemory using an autobiographical memory questionnaire in a sample of 30 high-\nfunctioning children with ASD and 38 typically developing children.  The questionnaire \nincluded items to assess knowledge of personal facts (e.g., \u201cWhat\u2019s your mother\u2019s \nname?\u201d) and memory for personally experienced events (e.g., \u201cWhat happened at your \nlast birthday party?\u201d).  They were also asked a series of yes-no life event questions such \nas \u201cHave you ever been on an aeroplane?\u201d  In line with Crane and Goddard\u2019s (2008) \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 18\nresults, children with ASD showed significantly poorer performance than typically \ndeveloping children on the questions assessing memory for personally experienced events \n(autobiographical episodic memory).  However, in contrast to Crane and Goddard\u2019s \n(2008) results, participants with ASD also showed significantly poorer performance on \nthe questions assessing knowledge of personal facts.  The groups performed equally well \non the yes-know life event questions3.  The absence of a performance deficit in the ASD \ngroup may be attributable to the fact that these questions did not demand the retrieval of \nany episodic, contextual details (for example, a child may know that they have been on an \naeroplane without remembering any event details).  Thus, autobiographical semantic \nknowledge may have been sufficient.  These results suggest that some elements of \nautobiographical semantic knowledge are intact in children with ASD, whilst others may \nbe impaired.  However, it should be noted that although the groups in this study were \nmatched for age, the typically developing group had a significantly higher mean full scale \nIQ than the ASD group.  This IQ decrement could potentially account for any significant \ngroup differences.   \nThe results of a study by Lee and Hobson (1998) shed additional light on the \nautobiographical semantic knowledge of children with ASD. Damon and Hart\u2019s (1988) \nself-understanding interview, which assesses various domains of self-knowledge, was \nadministered to a group of 12 adolescents with ASD who had low verbal ability and 10 \nage- and verbal ability-matched comparison adolescents.  The interview can be \nconsidered as an index of autobiographical semantic knowledge rather than \nautobiographical episodic memory, given that is does not require participants to recount \n                                                \n3 Although the statistics for the main effect of group on performance were not reported in the paper itself, \nM. Bruck (personal communication) kindly confirmed that the group difference in performance was not \nsignificant.  \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 19\nspecific past personal experiences.  It was found that participants with ASD produced \nsignificantly more, but qualitatively similar, descriptions of their physical and active \ncharacteristics, relative to comparison participants.  However, their self-descriptive \nstatements of psychological and social characteristics differed qualitatively from those of \ncomparison participants and in the latter instance quantitatively, in that they produced \nsignificantly fewer descriptions that fell into the social category.  It seems likely that such \n\u201cperson-related\u201d difficulties reflect the underlying social impairments that characterise \nASD.  Nevertheless, these findings suggest that at least certain aspects of semantic \nautobiographical knowledge are atypical in children with ASD and seem to suggest \nspecific deficits in psychological but not physical aspects of the self-concept.  \nOverall, the studies described above indicate that autobiographical episodic \nmemory is impaired in both adults and children with ASD, whereas autobiographical \nsemantic knowledge (which may index the self-concept) is impaired only amongst \nchildren with ASD.  This seems to suggest that self-concept development is delayed \n(even in relation to mental age) in ASD but, by adulthood, (at least high-functioning) \nindividuals appear to have \u201ccaught up\u201d to some extent.  \nGoddard et al. (2007) have argued that individuals with ASD have impairments in \nautobiographical episodic memory as a result of poorly elaborated or perhaps fragmented \nself-concepts, which provide insufficient structure around which to organize personally \nexperienced event memories or with which to tag information as self-relevant.  Such an \naccount could potentially explain why adults with ASD have difficultly with \nremembering events from childhood (when they had diminished self-concepts) but may \nnot fully explain why they also have difficulty remembering events from adulthood\nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 20\n(when they appear to have relatively intact self-concepts and should not therefore have \ndifficulty encoding information in relation to the self).  It is possible, however, that\nimpairments in autobiographical semantic knowledge\/self-concept development in \nchildhood impact upon autobiographical episodic memory development in such as way \nthat the effects persist through to adulthood.      \nAlternatively, autobiographical episodic memory may be impaired in ASD for \nreasons other than (or in addition to) a diminished self-concept.  For example, it is \npossible that established impairments in relational memory (Gaigg, Gardiner, & Bowler, \n2008) mean that individuals with ASD have difficulty binding together disparate event \nelements to produce coherent episodic memory traces.  This explanation also predicts\nimpairments in non-autobiographical episodic memory.  Non-autobiographical episodic \nmemory will be considered later.  First, however, studies of the self-reference effect in \nASD will be reviewed.      \nStudies of the self-reference effect provide a direct test of the capacity of \nindividuals with ASD to encode material in relation to the self-concept and may provide \nfurther evidence regarding whether or not individuals with ASD have intact self-\nconcepts\/autobiographical semantic memory.  In this respect, they provide an indirect \ninsight into whether autobiographical episodic memory difficulties can feasibly be \naccounted for by a diminished self-concept.  \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 21\nThe self-reference effect in ASD\nIt is well established that typical individuals show enhanced memory for information that \nis self-relevant or encoded in relation to the self (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977; \nSymons & Johnson, 1997).  This phenomenon, which is known as the self-reference \neffect, may viewed as an extension of the depth-of-processing effect (Craik & Tulving, \n1975).  The notion of depth-of-processing assumes that retrieval is a function of trace \nelaboration at the time of encoding, such that the deeper or more elaborate the encoding \nprocess, the more likely the information is to be later retrieved.  For example, \nphonologically processed items are retained less well than semantically processed items, \nwhich have been encoded at a deeper level.  The self is thought to act as a conceptual \nstructure with elaborative and organisational properties that enhance the deep encoding of \ninformation within memory (Klein & Loftus, 1988; Symons & Johnson, 1997).  \nTherefore, if individuals with ASD have a diminished or poorly integrated concept of self \n(i.e., impaired autobiographical semantic knowledge), there is reason to predict that they \nwill show a reduced or absent self-reference effect (Toichi et al., 2002).\nIn one study, Toichi et al. (2002) investigated the depth-of-processing and self-\nreference effects in a sample of 18 high-functioning adults with ASD, as well as 18 \ncomparison adults (matched for age, VIQ and PIQ).  During the study phase of their \nexperiment, participants were presented with a series of 30 target personality trait \nadjectives.  Immediately prior to the presentation of each target word, participants were \nasked one of three types of question, each of which was designed to induce either \nphonological (\u201cDoes the word rhyme with - ?\u201d), semantic (\u201cIs the meaning of the word \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 22\nsimilar to - ?\u201d), or self-referential (\u201cDoes the word describe you?\u201d) processing of the \ntarget word.  The study phase was followed by an immediate, surprise recognition test in \nwhich participants were presented with a list including the 30 target words as well as 60 \ndistractor words, and asked to select the 30 target words that they had been presented \nwith during the study phase.  The results indicated that the comparison group showed \ntypical levels-of-processing (phonological < semantic) and self-reference effects \n(semantic < self-referential), whereas the ASD group, whilst showing a levels-of-\nprocessing effect (phonological < semantic), did not show a self-reference effect \n(semantic \uf0bb self-referential).  However, there were no significant between-group \ndifferences in recognition of either semantically or self-referentially processed words.  \nThus, although the ASD group showed an atypical pattern of performance, in failing to \nshow a self-reference effect, their ability to encode material self-referentially was not \nsignificantly poorer than that of comparison participants.  \nThese results should be interpreted with caution, however, given that the \nparticular measure of recognition memory used was potentially inadequate.  Toichi et al. \n(2002) used hit rate - i.e., the proportion of target items correctly identified as old - as \ntheir measure of recognition memory.  However, hit rate offers an incomplete picture of \nrecognition memory, summarising performance on target item trials without taking into \naccount performance on distractor item trials.  A complete picture of performance on yes-\nno recognition tests can only be obtained through using measures (such as D' or A') that \ntake into account both hit rate and false alarm rate \u2013 i.e., the proportion of distractor items \nincorrectly identified as old (e.g., Snodgrass & Corwin, 1988).  As such, Toichi et al.\u2019s \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 23\nresults provide a potentially biased reflection of recognition memory performance that \nmay not prove to be reliable.  \nIn a more recent study, Lombardo, Barnes, Wheelwright, and Baron-Cohen \n(2007) used another variant of the typical depth of processing paradigm to test 30 high-\nfunctioning adults with ASD and 30 comparison adults (matched for age, VIQ, PIQ, and \nFSIQ).  During the study phase, participants were asked to judge, on a scale of 1 to 6, \nhow descriptive a series of trait adjectives were of either (a) themselves, (b) their best \nfriend, or (c) the fictional character, Harry Potter.  As a control condition, participants \nwere asked to (d) judge the number of syllables contained in particular trait labels.  \nFollowing a filled 30 minute delay, a surprise recognition test was administered.  Item \nrecognition was ascertained according to participants\u2019 confidence judgements regarding \nwhether test items (including target and distractor items) were old.  Confidence scores of \n1 to 3 were deemed \u201cnew\u201d judgements and scores of 4 to 6 were deemed \u201cold\u201d \njudgements.  D' scores were subsequently calculated.  It was found that participants with \nASD performed at similar levels to comparison participants in the Syllable Judgement \nand Harry Potter conditions, but performed significantly less well in the Self and Best \nFriend conditions.  Both groups showed depth-of-processing and, unlike in Toichi et al.\u2019s \nsample, self-reference effects (Syllable < Harry Potter < Best Friend < Self).  In order to \ninvestigate possible group differences in the magnitude of the self-reference effect, \ndifference scores were calculated for (a) Self versus Best Friend and (b) Self versus Harry \nPotter.  The difference scores for Self versus Best Friend were almost identical for both \ngroups.  However, the group difference in difference scores for Self versus Harry Potter \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 24\napproached significance and a moderate effect size (p = .07, Cohen\u2019s d = .49), reflecting \nthe fact that the ASD group showed a somewhat smaller self-reference effect.  \nUsing a similar paradigm, Henderson et al. (2009) assessed a sample of 31 high-\nfunctioning children with ASD and 31 comparison children (matched for age, VIQ, and \nPIQ).  In this study, three encoding conditions were used: participants were presented \nwith a series of trait adjectives and asked either (a) \u201cDoes this word contain seven or \nmore letters?\u201d (designed to elicit featural level processing); (b) \u201cDoes this word describe \nsomething about Harry Potter?\u201d; or (c) \u201cDoes this word describe something about you?\u201d  \nThe results closely mirrored those obtained by Toichi et al.  In terms of D' scores, it was \nfound that participants with ASD did not differ significantly from comparison \nparticipants in any of the three conditions.  However, whereas comparison participants \nshowed depth-of-processing and self-reference effects (Featural < Harry Potter < Self), \nparticipants with ASD showed a depth-of-processing effect (Featural < Harry \nPotter\/Self), but not a significant self-reference effect (Harry Potter \uf0bb Self).  Furthermore, \na regression analysis of Self versus Harry Potter difference scores revealed that children \nwith ASD showed a significantly smaller self-reference effect than comparison children.\nThus, both Lombardo et al. (2007) and Henderson et al. (2009) found that \nindividuals with ASD show smaller self-reference effects than comparison individuals, \nsuggesting that they show a diminution in self-referential processing.  However, whereas \nHenderson et al. (2009) found that children with ASD did not show the self-reference \neffect at all, Lombardo et al.\u2019s (2007) found that adults with ASD showed the self-\nreference effect to some extent.  In some respects, these results appear to mirror those \nobserved in the studies of autobiographical semantic knowledge, described above.  In \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 25\neach case, the results seem to imply that whereas children with ASD have impaired self-\nconcepts, adults with ASD do not (or have at least compensated to some extent, enabling \nsome degree of self-referential encoding).  \nOne key point to note is that the studies of self-referential memory, described \nabove, required participants to make judgements about personality trait adjectives (e.g.,\nclever, funny, cranky, etc.).  This would seem to require encoding in relation to \npsychological aspects of the self-concept \u2013 precisely the facet of the self-concept that is \nhypothesized to be diminished in ASD.  It would be interesting to test self-referential \nencoding in relation to physical trait adjectives.  In this case, performance differences \nbetween individuals with and without ASD would not be predicted.    \nMoreover, the extent to which the performance diminution is specific to the self is \nsomewhat unclear, given that participants with ASD in Lombardo et al.\u2019s study also \nperformed significantly less well than comparison participants in the Best Friend \ncondition (unfortunately Henderson et al. did not include this condition).  This would \nseem to suggest that individuals with ASD have difficulty with using both self and other \nas organising structures within memory, perhaps reflecting poorly integrated or \nelaborated psychological concepts of self and (close) others.  It seems likely that the \nsocial-communicative deficits that characterise ASD impact upon the capacity to acquire \nboth psychological self-knowledge and psychological knowledge of others, resulting in \nunder-elaborated concepts of self and others.  The ability to acquire psychological \nknowledge of Harry Potter does not depend on dynamic social interaction \u2013 it depends on \npassively reading books or watching films.  Hence, individuals with ASD should be able \nto form a typical \u201cHarry Potter concept\u201d.  This may explain why individuals with ASD in \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 26\nLombardo et al.\u2019s study showed diminished recognition memory in the Best Friend and \nSelf conditions but not the Harry Potter condition.  \nAnother aspect of the results of these studies of self-referential memory that may \nwarrant further attention concerns why participants with ASD did not show blanket \nmemory deficits, relative to comparison participants, across all conditions.  Although \nperformance on recognition memory tasks typically involves contributions from both \nepisodic and semantic memory, given that single item memory (rather than memory for \ncontext) is sufficient for successful performance on these particular tasks, episodic \nmemory need not be invoked (e.g., Wheeler et al., 1997).  Thus, successful performance \non such single item recognition tests does not imply intact episodic memory.  However, \nperformance on Lombardo et al.\u2019s (2007) and Henderson et al.\u2019s (2009) tasks does \ndepend on intact non-autobiographical semantic memory at test, for all conditions, and \nfor the self condition, intact autobiographical semantic knowledge (i.e., a well developed \nself-concept) at the time of encoding.  Thus, the results (at minimum) are indicative of \nintact non-autobiographical semantic knowledge but impaired autobiographical semantic \nknowledge.    \nMemory for the actions of self versus other in ASD\nIt is well established that typically developing individuals show superior memory for self-\nperformed actions as opposed to other-person-performed actions (e.g., Baker-Ward, Hess, \n& Flannagan, 1990) \u2013 a pattern of performance that may be referred to as the \u201cself-\nenactment effect\u201d.  One explanation for this retrieval advantage is that it is an extension \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 27\nof the self-reference effect, such that the relatively elaborate self-concept acts as a richer, \nmore effective structure for encoding than does the relatively less elaborate other-person-\nconcept.  Therefore, if individuals with ASD have under-elaborated self-concepts, they \nshould show a reduced or absent memory advantage for self-performed actions (e.g., \nHare, Mellor, & Azmi, 2007).  A number of studies of ASD have compared memory for \nthe actions of self and others.  \nOne of the most frequently cited studies of memory for self and other in ASD was \nconducted by Millward, Powell, Messer, and Jordan (2000).  Free and cued recall of \nactivities, such as buying sweets from a shop or visiting horses in a sanctuary, performed \neither by self or by an accompanying peer, was assessed in a sample of 12 children with \nASD (with low verbal ability) and 12 typically developing children, who were matched \nfor verbal mental age (Study 1).  The results indicated that participants with ASD recalled \nsignificantly fewer event details for self-performed activities than comparison \nparticipants, but there were no between-group differences in recall of peer-performed \nactivities.  In terms of within-group patterns of performance, the comparison group \nshowed significantly better recall for self-performed activities than peer-performed \nactivities (self-enactment effect), whilst the ASD group demonstrated the opposite \npattern, showing significantly better recall for peer-performed activities than self-\nperformed activities.  On the basis of these results, the authors concluded that \n\u201cindividuals with autism have a specific difficulty in the recall of personally experienced \nevents\u201d (p.24).  However, this interpretation may not be entirely justified.  \nAlthough the ASD and typically developing groups were matched on verbal \nmental age, the ASD group had a mean chronological age that was more than 7 years \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 28\nabove that of the comparison group.  Thus, it is possible that between-group differences \nin levels and patterns of performance on the experimental task can be accounted for by \nthe difference in verbal intelligence (the mean verbal IQs of the ASD and comparison \ngroups can be estimated at 53 and 107, respectively) rather than by ASD-specific deficits.  \nIn an attempt to overcome this limitation of the study, Millward et al. (2000) \nconducted a second study in which they assessed a sample of children with intellectual\ndisability who, like the ASD group in Study 1, had lower verbal mental ages than \nchronological ages.  However, in Study 2 no ASD or typically developing groups were \nincluded, and the group with intellectual disability in Study 2 was not comparable to the \nASD or typically developing groups from Study 1, in terms of either verbal mental age or \nchronological age.  Moreover, the group tested in Study 2 experienced a different set of \nevents in different locations to those used in the first study.  Therefore, any comparisons \nbetween the findings of Study 1 and Study 2 are unlikely to be informative. \nMore recently, Hare et al. (2007) used a \u201ctable-top tasks\u201d paradigm to compare \nfree and cued recall of self- versus other-performed actions amongst 12 low-functioning \nadults with ASD and 14 adults with intellectual disability, who were matched on \nreceptive vocabulary and grammar.  It was found that participants with ASD did not \nsignificantly differ from participants with intellectual disability in terms of either their \nfree recall or cued recall of actions, and both groups showed a free and cued recall \nadvantage for self-performed actions over other-performed actions.\nFarrant, Blades, and Boucher (1998) assessed memory for self and other in a \nsample of 15 children with ASD (with low verbal ability), 15 typically developing \nchildren matched for verbal mental age, and 15 children with intellectual disability \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 29\nmatched for chronological and verbal mental age, using a task that involved the \nexperimenter and participant listening to an audio recording, which instructed either \u201cthe \nperson holding the red block\u201d or \u201cthe person holding the blue block\u201d (referring to either \nthe experimenter or participant) to repeat single words aloud.  After 28 instructions from \nthe recording, and a short delay, the child was given a surprise recognition and source \nmemory test.  They were asked if particular (target and distractor) words were \u201cold\u201d or \n\u201cnew\u201d. For the words they identified as old, they were asked who had spoken the word \naloud.  Although the authors did not compare recognition memory accuracy for \u201cself\u201d \nand \u201cother\u201d words within or between the groups, it was found that within all groups, the \nproportion of correctly recognized \u201cself\u201d words correctly attributed to the self, and the \nproportion of correctly recognized \u201cother\u201d words correctly attributed to the experimenter \ndid not significantly differ \u2013 that is, none of the groups showed a self-enactment effect in \nself-other source memory.  This same pattern of performance was confirmed in a \nreplication study of children with ASD who had moderately impaired verbal ability \n(Hala, Rasmussen, and Henderson, 2005).  \nRussell and Jarrold (1999, Experiment 1) tested a sample of 22 children with ASD \n(with low verbal ability) using a task in which experimenter and child took turns to place \na total of 24 picture cards onto a picture lotto board, either on their own behalf or on the \nbehalf of a designated doll \u201cpartner\u201d.  Afterwards, the child had to remember with whom \neach card had originated and return the card to that person (themselves\/experimenter) or \ndoll (their doll\/experimenter\u2019s doll).  It was found that relative to verbal ability matched \ntypically developing children and children with intellectual disability, children with ASD \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 30\ngenerally performed less well on the task, and also showed a different pattern of \nperformance to the comparison groups.    \nFor the current purposes, the most significant finding was that both comparison \ngroups were better at remembering the correct origin of the cards they had placed on the \nboard themselves (i.e., their cards + their doll partner\u2019s cards) than of the cards they had \nobserved the experimenter place (i.e., experimenter\u2019s cards + experimenter\u2019s doll \npartner\u2019s cards) (with the difference reaching significance in the group with learning \ndisability but not the typically developing group), whereas the ASD group were \nsignificantly better at remembering the correct origin of the cards they had observed the \nexperimenter place on the board than of the cards they had placed themselves.  Thus, \nwhereas the comparison groups showed a self-advantage, the ASD group showed an \nother-advantage.  \nWilliams and Happ\u00e9 (2009a) recently failed to replicate Russell and Jarrold\u2019s \n(1999) findings.  They used a slightly modified version of the original task, in which 32 \nrather than 24 picture cards were used, to test a sample of 16 children with ASD (of \nmixed intellectual ability) and 16 comparison children (who were matched on age, VIQ, \nand PIQ).  It was found that participants with ASD showed both a similar level and \npattern of performance to comparison participants.  Neither of the groups showed a self-\nenactment effect, with both groups showing no significant difference in memory for the \norigins of their own (i.e., their cards + their doll partner\u2019s cards) and the experimenter\u2019s \n(i.e., experimenter\u2019s cards + experimenter\u2019s doll partner\u2019s cards) cards (D. Williams, \npersonal communication).  \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 31\nFinally, Lind and Bowler (2009c) assessed recognition and self-other source \nmemory in a group of 53 children with ASD, who had mixed levels of verbal ability, and \n50 comparison children (matched on age and verbal ability).  The experimental task \ninvolved a picture naming game in which the experimenter and participant took turns to \npick up and name picture cards.  Following a two minute filled delay, recognition and \nself-other source memory were assessed.  It was found that although participants with \nASD showed similar levels of recognition memory to comparison participants, they \nshowed significantly diminished source memory.  However, crucially, it was found that \nboth groups showed the same pattern of performance, with better recognition and source \nmemory for items originally picked up and named by the child rather than the \nexperimenter.  \nClearly, studies of memory for self and other in ASD have produced mixed \nresults.  However, only two out of the seven studies outlined above found qualitatively \ndistinct patterns of performance amongst participants with ASD, and the validity of the \nmethods used in one of these studies was questioned.  The remaining five studies have \neither found no difference between memory for self and other amongst participants with \nand without ASD or have found a typical self-enactment effect amongst participants with \nand without ASD.  Thus, the weight of the evidence seems to suggest that individuals \nwith ASD do not differ from individuals without ASD with respect to memory for the \nactions of self versus other.  \nIn contrast to the studies of the self-reference effect, these results seem to suggest \nthat individuals with ASD have self-concepts that have reached the \u201ccritical mass\u201d \nnecessary for encoding\/retrieving self-relevant information.  This may be because \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 32\nencoding, in this case, occurs in relation to physical (which are hypothesized to be intact \nin ASD) rather than psychological aspects of the self-concept and relies only on higher-\norder (or perhaps even primary) self-awareness of physical (or action based) aspects of \nself.\nNon-autobiographical Episodic Memory in ASD\nIt is now well established that individuals with ASD have impaired non-autobiographical \nepisodic memory (Ben Shalom, 2003; Bowler, Gaigg, & Lind, in press).  As explained \nabove, episodic and semantic memory are associated with autonoetic (self-knowing) and \nnoetic (knowing) awareness, respectively.  These states of awareness are readily \ndistinguished by individuals when retrieving memories.  Episodic (autonoetic) retrieval, \nor remembering, is associated with a rich recollective experience in which one has a \nfeeling of re-living the previously experienced event.  Semantic (noetic) retrieval, or \nknowing, is associated with a feeling of familiarity but no sense of re-living a past \nepisode.  This ability to distinguish between autonoetic and noetic states of awareness \nmay be exploited in order to investigate the relative contributions of episodic and \nsemantic memory, respectively, to performance on memory tasks.  In the traditional \n\u201cremember-know\u201d paradigm (Tulving, 1985), participants complete a standard \nrecognition memory test and, for each test item they identify as old, they are asked to \nstate whether they actually remember the item being presented at study or just know that \nit was presented at study.  Typical individuals tend to provide a mixture of remember and \nknow responses in recognition tests, reflecting the contribution of both episodic and \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 33\nsemantic memory to task performance.  Thus, if individuals with ASD have impaired \nepisodic memory, they should show less remembering and more knowing in such tests.    \nBowler, Gardiner, and Grice (2000) used a remember-know test to assess the \nrelative contributions of episodic and semantic memory to the recognition memory \nperformance of high-functioning adults with ASD.  Participants studied a list of 24 low-\nfrequency and 24 high-frequency words.  During the test phase, participants were asked \nto make remember-know judgements for items identified as old, and also to provide \njustifications of their responses (helping to ensure that reports corresponded to genuine \ninstances of remembering or knowing).  It was found that the ASD and comparison \ngroups (who were matched for age, VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ) showed almost identical levels \nof item recognition.  However, the ASD group provided significantly fewer remember \nresponses and significantly more know responses than the comparison group.  This \nsuggests that individuals with ASD are significantly less likely to retrieve rich, episodic \ntrace information and to become autonoetically aware of their memories.  \nIt could potentially be argued that remember-know judgments might not reflect \nthe same underlying processes amongst individuals with ASD as amongst typical \nindividuals \u2013 that is, amongst individuals with ASD, remember responses may not \ncorrespond to true instances of autonoetic awareness and know responses may not \ncorrespond to true instances of noetic awareness.  However, Bowler et al. (2000) found \nthat both groups showed a word frequency effect \u2013 they were more likely to give \nremember responses to recognised low-frequency words than to recognised high-\nfrequency words.  The fact that individuals with ASD respond to such experimental \nmanipulations in the same way as comparison participants provides reassurance that their\nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 34\nremember-know judgments do reflect genuine instances of autonoetic\/noetic awareness.  \nThese findings therefore suggest quantitative rather than qualitative differences between \nthe groups.  \nThese findings provide some of the clearest evidence for non-autobiographical \nepisodic memory difficulties in ASD and imply that people with ASD experience \nautonoetic awareness less frequently than people without ASD.  Given that performance \non such remember-know recognition memory tasks does not require material to be \nprocessed self-referentially (although it is possible that participants may incidentally do \nso on occasion), it seems highly unlikely that the encoding of material requires a self-\nconcept.  Therefore, deficits on non-autobiographical episodic memory tasks, such as \nthese, cannot be taken as evidence for diminished self-concepts in ASD.  \nIt was argued above that whereas autobiographical episodic retrieval necessarily \ninvolves re-experiencing the self as the object of experience (the \u201cme\u201d), non-\nautobiographical episodic retrieval involves re-experiencing the self as the subject of \nexperience (the \u201cI\u201d).  Thus, deficits in non-autobiographical episodic memory are \nprimarily likely to reflect deficits in re-experiencing the self as the subject of experience.  \nHowever, it is important to note that although these findings suggests that individuals \nwith ASD have difficulty re-experiencing themselves as the subject of experience, they \ndo not imply that individuals with ASD do not experience themselves as the subject of \nexperience (i.e., have subjective experiences) online.  \nOne plausible explanation for these deficits in re-experiencing past states of self is \nthat individuals with ASD have an impaired capacity for memory binding.  If an \nindividual is unable to effectively link together event features in order to reconstruct a \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 35\npast episode, they simply cannot mentally re-experience that past episode in order to \nbecome aware of a past state of self.  Recent evidence suggests that individuals with ASD \nhave significant difficulties with such binding.  Bowler, Gaigg, and Gardiner (2008) \nfound that high-functioning adults with ASD showed undiminished recognition memory, \nrelative to comparison adults (matched for age, VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ), when required to \nidentify items on the basis of single features (e.g., shape) but showed significantly \ndiminished performance when required to identify items on the basis of combinations of \nfeatures (e.g., colour and shape), which relies on episodic binding.  \nConclusions\nAt the outset of this paper, it was argued that aspects of memory and the self are bi-\ndirectionally related.   For example, the typical development of autobiographical episodic \nmemory may depend on the emergence of a rudimentary self-concept, which is itself \nbased on autobiographical semantic knowledge; and the emergence of a more \nsophisticated, temporally extended self-concept may depend on the development of \nautobiographical episodic memory (and episodic future thinking).  \nResearch seems to indicate that certain aspects of autobiographical semantic \nknowledge may be impaired amongst children with ASD, implying that individuals with \nASD have self-concepts, particularly in the psychological domain, which are \nimpoverished relative to individuals without ASD.  The fact that such deficits appear to \nselectively affect psychological but not physical aspects of the self-concept may reflect \nthe fact that the acquisition of psychological autobiographical semantic knowledge \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 36\ndepends on social factors (Neisser, 1988).  The fact that individuals with ASD \ncharacteristically exhibit marked social and communication impairments may, therefore, \nlimit their opportunities for acquiring psychological self-knowledge (Lind & Bowler, \n2008).  \nWhether or not impairments in autobiographical episodic memory are the \nconsequence of an impaired self-concept in ASD remains an empirical question, given \nthat no studies have directly addressed this issue.  However, studies of self-referential \nmemory provide indirect insight.  Although self-referential memory tasks do not \nnecessarily tap autobiographical episodic memory, they do shed light on the capacity to \nencode information as \u201cself-relevant\u201d.  Studies typically indicate that adults and children \nwith ASD show a diminished self-reference effect.  Individuals with ASD are likely to \nhave a corresponding difficulty with encoding information as self-relevant in episodic \nmemory.  Given that such self-referential memory tasks require self-referential encoding \nin relation to psychological aspects of the self-concept, these results are consistent with \nthe suggestion of specific deficits in these aspects of the self-concept in ASD.  \nIn terms of memory for the actions of self versus other, the majority of the \nevidence indicates that individuals with ASD show patterns of performance that are \nqualitatively similar to those of individuals without ASD, suggesting that the self acts as \na similarly effective organising structure in memory for individuals with and without \nASD.  This, it is argued, is due to the fact that the self-enactment effect in memory \ndepends only upon higher-order (or even primary) physical self-awareness which appears \nrelatively undiminished in ASD.    \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 37\nThe majority of the evidence suggests that individuals with ASD have \nimpairments in autobiographical episodic memory and episodic future thinking.  The fact \nthat individuals with ASD seem to have diminished memory for past personal \nexperiences and a diminished capacity for simulating possible future experiences and,\ntherefore, for re-experiencing past states of self or pre-experiencing future states of self,\nimplies that they have a diminished sense of self, of personal history, and of personal \ncontinuity through time.  Attenuated temporally extended self-awareness would seem to \nbe an inevitable consequence of attenuated autobiographical episodic memory and future \nthinking.  Interestingly, children with ASD show intact delayed self-recognition, which \nmay indicate intact temporally extended physical self-awareness.  Thus, individuals with \nASD may have selective deficits in temporally extended psychological self-awareness.\nDespite the accumulating evidence of impairments in psychological aspects of the \nself-concept and higher-order psychological self-awareness in ASD, it seems unlikely \nthat impairments in autobiographical episodic memory could be totally accounted for in \nterms of impairments in the self-concept, given that there are additional impairments in \nnon-autobiographical episodic memory, which is unlikely to require a self-concept.  \nTogether, these findings suggest that a diminution in self-awareness can only partially \nexplain autobiographical episodic memory impairments in ASD.  It seems likely that \nother factors, such as difficulties with memory binding, also play a role.  Thus, although \nboth autobiographical and non-autobiographical episodic memory are impaired in ASD, \nthe impairment in the former (which relies on both a self-concept and binding) is likely to \nbe more marked than the latter (which relies only on binding).  \nLind (2010).  Memory and the Self in Autism 38\nIn summary, although memory in ASD is not wholly characterised by an \u201cabsent \nself\u201d (cf. Frith, 2003), impairments in psychological aspects of the self-concept are likely \nto result in a reduced capacity for self-referential encoding (at least when psychological \naspects of self are involved), as well as impaired autobiographical episodic memory and \nfuture thinking.  These memory deficits are likely to further impact upon the self \nresulting, ultimately, in a diminished temporally extended (psychological) self.   \nLind (2010).
