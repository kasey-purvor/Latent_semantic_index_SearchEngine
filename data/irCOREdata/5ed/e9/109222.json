This paper investigates the increasingly popular practice of ghost tourism comprising urban\nghost tours and organised paranormal investigations. Set in the context of modern forms of enchant-\nment, wherein audiences engage in a knowing and reflexive sense of `delight without delusion', the\npaper explores the various infrastructures, (discursive, affective, and material) that engender a sense\nof supernatural possibility.

This infrastructure relies on the engineering of\ndispositions that are both shaped on and brought to the tourist event itself. As such, those with deeply\nheld beliefs in ghosts and the afterlife, as well as those for whom the infrastructures fail to generate\nwonder, place limits on the artifice of modern enchantment. The paper uses examples from participant\nobservation on ten ghost tours across the UK, an overnight vigil in a Tudor mansion, and interviews\nwith tour guides.\ndoi:10.1068\/d9909In section 3 I attend further to the affective charges and intensities involved in the\nostension and play of ghost tourism and suggest ways in which these registers are\nmoulded and sometimes challenged.\nSituating ghost tourism\nThe commercial exploitation of ghosts is nothing necessarily new. For example, Davies\n(2007) records how historically it was common for crowds to gather at sites of alleged\nhaunting and for local businesses to reap the rewards. Thus, he cites Horace Walpole's\nobservation that the famous Cock Lane ghost of 1762 allowed ``all the taverns and\nalehouses in the neighbourhood [to] make fortunes'' (page 63). Inglis and Holmes\n(2003) also explore the 18th-century and 19th-century upper-class fascination with\nScotland as a repository of ghosts and the supernatural. The widespread alleged\nhaunting of pubs and inns in the UK has allowed many proprietors to market the\nopportunity to spend a spooky night in their establishment. However, Davies (2007)\nreveals that there are relatively few examples of the commercial marketing of haunted\nsites before the 20th century. Indeed, recently there has been a shift in how places and\ncommunities deal with alleged apparitions\u00f6in that ghost tourism is ``a reversal of the\nhistoric[a1] position where communities desired to be rid of their spirits'' to one\nwhereby ``the ghost is a desirable lodger rather than an unwelcome guest'' (Davies,\n2007, page 64). This has led places such as Edinburgh, Chester, and Derby to seek\nthe title of `most haunted city in the UK'. Yet York, with more than 504 recorded\nhauntings, often claims the crown with the (now seemingly defunct) Ghost Research\nFoundation International naming it the most haunted city in Europe in 2002 (BBC\nNews, 2002). The honour of most haunted village in the UK is often awarded to\nPluckley in Kent, with twelve to fourteen resident ghosts.(1)\nThere are at least three key elements to contemporary ghost tourism. First are the\nhotels that seek guests through claiming to be haunted. For example,Wills lists the top-\nten haunted houses where one should not ``expect a quiet night's sleep'' (2007, page 1).\nA number of travel companies have sprung up offering lists of and breaks in haunted\nlocations, including Haunting Breaks and The Haunted Hotel Guide. Second are the\ncompanies that offer the tourist the chance to go ghost hunting. No doubt drawing on\nthe popularity of Living TV's Most Haunted and its ghost hunting exploits (which\nregularly gets viewing figures of 1^2 million) and representing a commercialisation\nof paranormal investigation undertaken by a plethora of `amateur' groups throughout\nthe UK, these companies allow visitors to enact paranormal investigations using group\nvigils, Ouija boards, se \u00a8 ances, and different technologies (such as meters that measure\nelectromagnetic frequencies) in the presence of mediums and psychics. Companies such\nas The Haunted Hotel Guide offer both normal breaks and special `weekend haunts'\nwherein these spooky expeditions can be performed. Other firms such as Haunted\nHappenings, Paranormal Tours, and Eerie Evenings focus on the investigation itself\nwith participants required to stay awake all night. The ghost hunt I undertook was\norganised by one of the longer established companies, Fright Nights.(2)\nThe third aspect of ghost tourism is ghost tours or ghost walks. These involve\norganised walks around cities and towns during which one takes in the sites of alleged\nhauntings, listens to ghost stories, and in some cases (such as Edinburgh) watches\nactors perform the narratives behind the spooky happenings. These tours have become\n(1) In 2009 the parish council for the village officially cancelled all Halloween events after residents\nbecame ``fed up of being invaded by hundreds of ghost-hunting revellers, causing vandalism and\ntraffic chaos'' (The Daily Telegraph 2009).\n(2)Most of the larger companies offer private investigations for groups and businesses, thus tapping\ninto the profitable sphere of corporate tourism and events.\nGhost tourism and infrastructures of enchantment 619an international phenomenon and can be found in most major cities in the US, Europe,\nAustralia, and New Zealand. In the US, Savannah, Georgia, is often said to host the\nmost tours (Savannah Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, 2008; see Gentry, 2007;\nGlanton, 2007). In the UK approximately twenty-eight UK cities and towns host ghost\ntours, with York having at least four regular tours and Edinburgh boasting four major\ntour companies each running two to five walks. It is difficult to provide accurate\nnumbers of people going on these tours. However, in a survey of 7051 visitors between\n2005 and 2008, 3656 people `spent time in York in the evening' (52%). Of these, nearly\n8% (on average) went on a ghost walk (Visit York, 2008). One tour guide in York\nestimated that 10000 to 15000 came on his walk in 2008. Further evidence of\npopularity can be found in their frequency (many run on a nightly basis all year round),\nthe amount of visitors on specific tours (with numbers of 200 not uncommon\non Halloween), and the relatively intense rivalry between the tours in the same city.\nAs one tour guide put it to me, ``There's a lot of ghost wars out there.''\nThere are a number of other pertinent trends and contexts in and through which\nthe development of ghost tourism must be understood. First, despite having a popular-\nity with some longevity (see Briggs, 1977; Holloway and Kneale, 2008; Kneale, 2006;\nOwen, 2004; Warner, 2006), fascination with ghost stories, paranormal investigations,\nand the supernatural seems to have had resurgence of late. Indeed, a recent survey of\n2000 people found that 39% believe in ghosts (Theos, 2008). Furthermore, interest in\nghosts is evidenced in the popular media: the aforementioned Most Haunted (LivingTV,\n2002 onwards) is approaching its 13th series, and its spin-offs Most Haunted Live\n(Living TV, 2002) and Derek Acorah's Ghost Towns (Living TV, 2005^06) are joining\nthe ranks of similar shows such as Dead Famous (Living TV, 2004^06), Ghost Hunting\nwith... (ITV2, 2006^08), and Fear (MTV, 2000) in this growth of broadcasting the\nghostly. These investigative shows are in turn part of a broader sustained series of\ndrama programming that deals with ghosts and the spirits of the dead, including\nAfterlife (ITV, 2005^06), Sea of Souls (BBC1, 2004^07) and BBC4's revival of the\nChristmas ghost story with adaptations of M R James's, AV i e wf r o maH i l l(BBC4,\n2005), Number 13 (BBC4, 2006), and The Crooked House (BBC4, 2008). In terms of\nfilm, Hollywood has in recent years turned back to the supernatural horror genre\nparticularly after the success of The Blair Witch Project (USA 1999) through Western\nremakes of South and East Asian supernatural films such as Ring (Japan 1998; USA\n2002) and The Eye (Hong Kong 2002; USA 2008).\nThe second context for ghost tourism is that of dark tourism, or thanotourism,\nhence the commodification of, travel to, and experiencing of sites and places associated\nwith death, dying, and disaster (Foley and Lennon, 1996; Lennon and Foley, 1999;\n2000; Sharpley and Stone, 2009; Stone, 2006; Stone and Sharpley, 2008). Much of the\nliterature on this kind of tourism concerns different typologies of attractions and travel\nactivities, or the various `shades' of dark tourism along a spectrum (Stone, 2006;\nStrange and Kempa, 2003).(3) Aligned with this wider development in the tourist\nindustry and with echoes of Dracula Tourism (Light, 2007), ghost tourism tends\ntowards the `lighter' end of the dark tourism spectrum, with entertainment being a\nkey orientation, especially for ghost tours. Yet, as we shall see, and as Gentry (2007)\npoints out, this does not preclude moments of sombre reflection and genuine belief and\n(3)For example, Seaton (1996) suggests five types of dark tourism, including travel to: witness\npublic enactments of death (less common in recent centuries in the West); sites of mass or\nindividual death (for example, battlefields, Ground Zero, or sites of assassination); sites of intern-\nment or memorials (for example, mass graveyards); sites of symbolic representations of death\n(at unconnected sites); or sites of simulation or reenactment of death (see Crang, 1996).\n620 J Hollowayattempts at providing historically accurate portrayals of haunted activity, all of which\nare usually associated with the `darkest' form of dark tourism.(4)\nThe third, wider context for ghost tourism is the challenge it represents to the\nso-called disenchantment thesis. Broadly conceived, this thesis takes it as axiomatic\n``that wonders and marvels have been demystified by science, spirituality has been\nsupplanted by secularism, spontaneity has been replaced by bureaucratization, and\nthe imagination has been subordinated to instrumental reason'' (Saler, 2006, page 692).\nTherefore, for some commentators, belief in ghosts and the supernatural would be\nerased with modernisation and replaced by rationality and materialism. For others this\nbelief would be relegated to the position of a residual Other or at least discursively\npositioned and marginalised to `primitive' and nonmetropolitan spaces. As such, mod-\nernity's disenchantment is enacted through, as Saler (2006, page 696) argues, the\n`binary' approach, in which ghosts, the occult, and magic do not disappear completely\nbut are ``marginalized in various ways as residual phenomena both subordinate to and\nexplicable by modernity's rational and secular tenets'', and the `dialectical' approach of\nMarxism (for example, Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002) in which modernisation is an\nideology of enchantment in itself, and popular culture a delusion to be uncovered as\nfalse consciousness.\nYet the disenchantment thesis has been found to be wanting in a number of\nsignificant ways, not least because of the critical limitations placed (under a putative\npostmodernity) on science and rationalism's dominance. Indeed, what Saler calls\n`antinomial' accounts\u00f6wherein magic and science, the occult and rationality exist in\nmultiple and contradictory relations to one another, and where such oppositions are\nseen as inherent to modernity\u00f6have taken hold. As McEwan puts it (2008, page 30):\n``Enchantment can be a state in which ghosts, spirits, and spectres exist within a\nmelange of other marvels, including magic, myth, monsters, witchcraft, sorcery,\nvoodoo, vampires, and zombies ... . Such marvels are no longer thought to have\nbeen exorcised by the rational and secular processes of modernity; far from being\nextraneous to modernity, they are intrinsic to what are increasingly recognised as\nthoroughly enchanted modernities.''\nThe line between disenchantment and enchantment has thus become increasingly\nblurred. Modernity produces its own enchantments through, for example, the apparent\n`wonders'of science (see Bennett, 2001); the persistence of the occult and belief in the\nsupernatural, as with 19th-century spiritualism and mesmerism (see Holloway, 2006;\nOppenheim, 1985; Winter, 1998); and the coexistence of magic, urbanism, and global-\nisation (Pile, 2005; 2006), all of which reveal the constant tension between and\ninterrelation of magic and modernity and the magic of modernity itself (Pels, 2003).\nFurthermore, the widespread belief in occult forces and the alarming rate of accusa-\ntions of witchcraft in Africa point to the disenchantment thesis being at odds with\nexperiences in nonmetropolitan, postcolonial contexts (Comaroff and Comaroff, 1993;\nGeschiere, 1998; McEwan, 2008).\nThe complication of the disenchantment thesis has given rise to what have been\ncalled `modern enchantments'. In particular, Saler [via the work of During (2002) on\nconjuring and stage magic] discusses how ``the discourse of disenchantment itself fostered\nsecular and rational enchantments aimed at the imagination\u00f6and at how the imagina-\ntion itself has become a central source of modern enchantment'' (2006, page 713). These\nmodern enchantments charm and conjure a sense of imaginative wonder, yet do so\n(4) Gentry (2007) highlights how ghost tourism often involves movement through public space.\nAs we shall see, and as Wilbert and Hansen (2009) have explored in terms of Jack the Ripper tours\nin the East End of London, this gives rise to strange juxtapositions where everyday geographies\nand nontourist populations coincide with the performance of tourism.\nGhost tourism and infrastructures of enchantment 621with a degree of self-reflexivity and ironic distance producing `magic assemblages'\n``that delight one's reason and imagination without deluding them'' (Saler, 2006,\npage 713). Here an awareness of contingent and provisional meaning allows enchant-\nment to flourish in modernity: one is entertained and thrilled through being given a\nchance to wonder and revel in a mixture of indeterminate meaning and possibility.\nIt is precisely in the context of these modern enchantments that this paper is placed.\nI begin the next section with an example of a ghost tour.\nLegend-tripping and enchantment\nThe Shambles, the famous Medieval Street in the centre of York, is the appropriate\nmeeting place for The Ghost Hunt of York. Around seventy adults and half a dozen\nchildren gather. A hand bell rings, and the guide, resplendent in Victorian cape and\ntop hat, walks slowly down the street. We are led through darkened alleyways into\ncourtyards not visible from the street and down unfamiliar lanes. The first apparent\nperformative register of the ghost walk emerges through a series of multiple and\nintersecting rhythms that lend a sense of emergent temporal order to the tour (Edensor\nand Holloway, 2008): there is the steady and familiar pace of walking, perhaps slowed\nsomewhat by the sheer number of people on the tour and the rhythms of a typical\nSaturday night\u00f6the rush of revellers hastily making their way to pubs and clubs, the\ninterruption of a car stereo blasting techno with its own tempo. Yet, the rhythmic\nparticularities of the ghost tour emerge through the pauses, the stops, and the stillness\nas the location is reached and the ghost story is told\u00f6like the following at Stonegate,\nin York:\n``The story concerns a tiny stone house and the ghost of a small child. The ghost is\noften seen at this tiny window with tears in her eyes and scratching at the glass. The\nhouse has come to be known as the plague house and the story goes back to 1604.\nThe family that lived there were scared of catching the plague. They would stay\ninside as much as they possibly could. They had a small daughter who they sent out\nto the market for provisions. One night, when her mother was tucking the child\ninto bed, she noticed the daughter had developed large...black...boils ... underneath\nher arms.\nShe said nothing to the child except `good night'. But that night, as she left\nher bedroom, she locked the door behind her and she went down to her husband\nand together they decided to leave their home\u00f6to leave York and to leave behind\ntheir only child. And that is what they did. But before they left, they painted a\nlarge red cross on the door to warn people that the building was infected. Well\nno doubt, when the child awoke the next morning she'd have gone to her bed-\nroom door, but she would have found it...locked. And no doubt she would have\ncalled out to her mother, but there would have been...no...answer. And surely\nshe would have gone to the tiny window to try and attract the attention of\npassers-by? We can be sure many people did see her, but they would also have\nseen the large red cross on the door and would not have dared to enter. For the\npoor child had been deserted by her parents, left a prisoner in her own bedroom\nand left to die in pain and all alone.\nShe is one of York's most frequently seen ghosts\u00f6seen up to ten times a\nyear. Sometimes during the day, sometimes at night, people will see a small child\nwith blond hair crying and scratching at the tiny window. And of course nowadays\npeople will go to the front of the house, they will knock on the door and they will\nsay `Don't you know there is something wrong with your child?' But of course the\npeople who live there now just say...`I'm sorry...but we have...no... children'.''\n622 J HollowayStories, such as this, are central to the performative make-up of ghost tours.\nIn addition to the pacing of the tour are the recognisable rhythms of the stories told:\nthe historical and circumstantial detail is rushed, and the mysterious is lingered upon,\nwith the pace quickening again when the climax of the story is reached. Performative\nconsistency also emerges through familiar tropes of content involving, for example,\nrestless spirits somehow wronged in life or revenants with messages to pass onto the\nliving (Davies, 2007). Here the ghost stories can be aligned with legends and legend-\ntelling in general (see Hall, 1973, page 167). Yet, as Ellis asserts, ``if all is content and\nthere is no art of legend telling, then the thing as verbalized is nothing in particular''\n(2003, page 10). As such, the rhythm and pacing are combined with stylistic markers,\nin particular the forcible intonation of the story's climax or sudden rises in volume,\nto produce a seemingly generic form of ghost story performance (Bakhtin, 1986).\nThe performative force of legend-telling is achieved through style, content, and\npacing. Furthermore, these are dialogical events where teller and listener are produced\nand drawn into relation and where aesthetic expectations in the audience, derived\nthrough intersemiotic and intertextual translation, are drawn upon and sustained.\nThe tale is thus not the product of one single stage of performance but of multiple\nand resonating (mediated) sites in which ``cultural memories are played out, thereby\nshaping meaning-making processes at play within these walks'' (Wilbert and Hansen,\n2009, page 197). Participants, as they wander between the stops, discuss horror films or\nsupernatural novels they have read and watched, emphasising the mediated legend and\nits telling. Often audience expectations remain implicit\u00f6although on some tours, in\nexpressing disappointment with the walks, tourists reveal the expectation of entertain-\nment value. Indeed, tour guides can be explicit about how they draw upon audience\nexpectations and how they reproduce generic ghost-storytelling markers: discussing the\nexuberant and knowing exaggeration of his storytelling style, one guide remarked to\nme, ``Well everybody loves a bit of hamminess don't they?''\nArguably, ghost tourism has the capacity to successfully disorientate and open\nup a sense of the possibilities of the city (see Jansson and Lagerkvist, 2009). For\nexample, in York our orientation in the daytime, and on previous visits to the city,\nbecomes something unfamiliar as we traverse the artificially, partially lit streets and\nalleyways at night. We become disorientated, our sense of direction is transformed,\nand once combined with the tales of the spectral, movement is coloured with a sense\nof the extraordinary and indeterminate. Further, a differentiated temporality emerges:\nthe past and history are brought to bear on the sites visited, and a narrative and\nheritage of the strange is performed. As Powell has it: ``The past impregnates the\npresent in a haunting which seeks to block the flow of present into future ... time loops\nback and refuses to progress as earlier periods insist on their equal, or superior,\nvalidity to the present era'' (2005, page 11). Yet this ordering of possibility is a pre-\ncarious endeavour, as the familiarity of a night out in a city, plus the often banal\npractices of being a tourist, threatens to overwhelm inventive ghostly speculation\n(Edensor, 2007). This uncertainty was underlined in Douglas when we passed a patron\nsmoking outside a pub shouting, ``There are no ghosts on the Isle of Man. You're all\nbeing conned again'', or in Manchester where a group of teenagers on bicycles taunt\nand question the guide between stops.\nImportantly, the materiality of the buildings and architecture is allowed to bring\nforth imaginative conjecture. At Stonegate in York we strain to see the ghost of the\nsmall girl at the window (see figure 1). No ghost appears. If it did, on that cold January\nnight, our normalised and habitual worlds would have been shaken and overturned.\nThe materiality literally frames the opportunity for supposition offering the tourists a\nsite to wonder at, a site to gaze at in hope for the extraordinary to make itself known.\nGhost tourism and infrastructures of enchantment 623The window, and the ghost story that animates it, acts as a literal and discursive frame\nthat produces a sense of spectral possibility\u00f6a sense that the window could reveal the\nsupernatural. That the ghost has appeared before produces a feeling of unease mixed\nwith excited speculation as the empty window orders the lure of possibility.\nGhost tours are performed in a way that situates knowledge and understanding as\ninterstitial. The common use of doorways, openings to alleyways (particularly in\nDouglas and Manchester), and windows as storytelling locations adds an architectural\nemphasis to the focus on thresholds between worlds (Kneale, 2006). This `what if?'\nquality resounds with questions of `what lies beyond?', and a register of possibility\nallows matter to speak in diversely imaginative ways and with creative inquisition.\nThe ghost story thus has the capacity to present supernatural possibility. Here the\nstory narrative should be read less for its representational qualities and more for\nwhat the tale enacts, how it allows space to show up and how it assembles a series\nof relations that coordinate the ghost tour (Carter and McCormack, 2006): as one\nguide declares, ``I do the stories as if I'm scared by them myself. So hopefully people\nwill empathise with me and think `Blimey, he's scared maybe I ought to be scared\nas well.'''\nYet this is not a simple discursive layering of the possible supernatural upon the\ninactive stone of buildings or the material frames of doorways. Instead, one can\nsuggest that the buildings, the stone, and the doorways act back upon the participants.\nIn other words, materiality comes with its own affordance and capacities that con-\ntribute to the ordering of the tour. As Anderson and Wylie (2009) point out, matter\nFigure 1. Haunted window? Stonegate, York (source: author's photograph).\n624 J Hollowayand materiality need to be rethought as multiple resonating fields of activity: this is\nrealised on ghost tours through the active affordance and constitutive role of matter in\nordering the emergent force of the possible supernatural. As such, architectural mate-\nrialities are incorporated into and, in a sense, incorporate the tour as an assemblage of\nthe possible: they gather a sense of possibility as much as they are gathered as sources\nof possibility through narrative production.\nGhost tours, then, are assemblages which seek to engender the possibility that the\nurban realm is haunted and that the dead can appear to the living. As Koven puts it,\n``entertaining `the possible', even if ultimately discounted, is part and parcel of legend-\ntelling'' (2007, page 195), or as one guide expressed,``I like to think I'm the gatekeeper,\nif you like, to the unknown.'' Participants are invited to question the reality of the\nspectral, and as such ghost tours perform a ``communal exploration of the boundaries\nof reality'' (Ellis, 2003, page 106). This emphasis on possibility arguably overrides a\nsimple dichotomy of belief or disbelief. Although many tour guides emphasise the\nreliability and `authenticity' of their stories, generally it seems veracity is secondary to\npossibility, as the demarcation of reality and unreality is explored and questioned: what\nwe think we know and what we ought to know is injected with a sense of unpredict-\nability and potential irrationality. As two guides observed: ``We're not here to say if\nghosts exist or not. It's down to you as individuals to make your own mind up ...\nWe're just saying open your mind up and just have a listen to these stories'', and\n``We're raising awareness of possibilities. We hope to stimulate questions as to\nwhether ghosts exist and if so what does it mean.''\nAnother example: in the failing light of dusk, approximately twenty ghost tourists\ngather in the graveyard of St George's church (completed 1781) in Douglas on the Isle\nof Man. The guide, in frock coat and tricorne, stands next to a plain crucifix headstone\nbearing the words `Cholera 1832^33' which commemorates the victims of the epi-\ndemics that hit the island, many of whom lie under the churchyard (see figure 2). He\npoints to a renovated building opposite the graveyard and tells of an IT worker who,\nleaning out of the window one night to enjoy a cigarette, sees the figure of a woman\ndressed in a black cloak float towards the grave and vanish. The figure is potentially\nthat of Eleanor Brennan who died in 1859 and dedicated her life to the sick in Douglas\nparticularly during the epidemics. The story ends with an extended pause inviting\nthe participants to share inquisitive glances and comments as to the likelihood of the\nevents and the nature of the ghostly figure seen. We move on from the graveyard at\npace. One tourist stays to take a quick photograph of the area as the group moves on.\nCatching up with the rest of the group, he claims to have captured an anomalous shape\non the image\u00f6we strain to see the dark outline on the camera's LCD image viewer,\nand the possibility that something is there is shared. Here the tale, the gravestones, and\nthe apparent anomalous image are active in the invitation of speculation: they allow\n``us to ask the question, but [they are] shy to give the answer'' (Ellis, 2003, page 72).\nThe event, the narrative, the photograph, and the materialities are, as Lindahl (2005,\npage 179) puts it, ``straining for wholeness''.\nThis ordering of possibility can be seen as a mode of enchantment. In Bennett's\n(2001, page 111) words, enchantment ``consists of a mixed bodily state of joy and\ndisturbance, a transitory sensuous condition dense and intense enough to stop you in\nyour tracks and toss you onto a new terrain and to move you from the actual world to\nits virtual possibilities''. As such, enchantment occurs where we are simultaneously\nexcited and made to feel uneasy as the world we know, the mundane world in which\nwe live, is suspended and affects us in unforeseen ways. Enchantment is often a mix, on\nthe one hand, of excitement, awe, and wonder and, on the other, of unease, dislocation,\nand unpredictability. For Schneider (1993, page 3), enchantment is ``the excitement\nGhost tourism and infrastructures of enchantment 625[that] comes from being lifted out of our mundane existence and situated on the verge\nof a new understanding of our world'' and the ``unease [that] derives from the assault\nupon our prior sense of how the world works\u00f6and thus upon our practical compe-\ntence in dealing with it''. However, enchantment is not always some seismic interrup-\ntion of the ordinary; it depends in part on the performance of a ``state of openness'' to\ndislocation (Bennett, 2001, page 131). As we saw above, modern enchantment encom-\npasses a knowing revelry in the indeterminacy of meaning accompanied by a reflective\nself-awareness of delusion and make-believe. On these ghost tours this modern mode\nof enchantment is evidenced through the palpable willingness and expectation to be\nenchanted\u00f6a simultaneous opening up to possibility and indeterminacy. This con-\nscious mood for and of enchantment has a capacity to affect those involved and is an\nacute part of the performative make-up of the space. Indeed, this collective disposition\nbecomes a contagious modality of consumption as the events proceed: often downright\ncynicism and rational commitment to debunking gives way to a willing and deliberate\nsuspension of disbelief. Through a readiness for the unknown, tourists and participants\nenact a modern form of enchantment by becoming ``willing collaborators in unreality''\n(Ellis, 1981, page 496). Yet this too is a precarious ordering that guides are aware of\nwith one describing how ``if people are really sceptical about it and are determined not\nto have fun then it's a bit of a pain.''\nIn Oxford our guide Bill Spectre leads us down Brasenose Lane, a narrow road that\nleads to the Radcliffe Camera. We are told how, one late night in 1832, a fellow of\nBrasenose College was walking down the lane when he saw an undergraduate being\nFigure 2. Cholera headstone. St. George's Church, Douglas, Isle of Man (source: author's\nphotograph).\n626 J Hollowaydragged out of a window by a tall and thin cloaked man. The window, covered in a\nwire mesh, belonged to the rooms of the Brasenose Hell Fire Club. Panicking, the\nfellow alerted the porter of the college, who rushed to the room to find Edward\nTrafford, the president of the club, dead in the room. Trafford's face was covered\nwith wire mesh marks. That night they had been attempting to summon the devil.\nIt is believed they succeeded, and Trafford's soul had been carried off by Old Nick\nhimself.\nThe story is told in an exaggerated style. We are encouraged to ask for a sign to\nconfirm the events of that night in 1832. As we repeatedly chant ``give us a sign'', the\nbook that Bill Spectre holds bursts into flames (see figure 3). Here the bodies of\nthe participants react to, or turn onto the flames with an affective and embodied sense\nof their danger and sudden eruption\u00f6the flames thus territorialise senses of shock in\nthe moment of their conjuring as they coassemble the wonder of the ghost-tour event.\nOnce again, therefore, we see the coagency of materiality as it precipitates the tourist\nevent as a space of emergent possibility (Anderson and Wylie, 2009): the performance\nof wonder, emergent as we engage in the spectacle of the trick, is partly configured by\nthe flames and their affective resonance. Furthermore, the atmospheric conditions that\nnight colour the affective charge of enchantment yet in ways that direct attention and\nsensation away from wonder and enchantment: the night was a bright summer's\nevening, and the capacity of the event to engender a sense of wonder was blunted by\nthe tangible lack of mystery that darkness brings forth and affords. Thus, despite the\naffective assembling of momentary wonder as the flames burst forth from the book,\nFigure 3. Bill Spectre's Ghost Trails, Oxford (source: author's photograph).\nGhost tourism and infrastructures of enchantment 627an affective collective disposition of possibility lacks duration as other (im)materialities\ngain precedence. However, the next night my partner and I return to Brasenose Lane.\nThis time, as we retell the story in the damp, unlit, and empty lane, the site shows up\ndifferently and the architecture and conditions precipitate and intensify a sense of the\nspooky possibility. This time the dark lane, window, and the narrative of 1832 have\nthe capacity to affect our experience as the place surges with enchantment and tense\npossibility (see figure 4). Achieving a state of modern enchantment thus depends on\nthe affective assembling of a series of active infrastructural elements not all of which\ncan be controlled.\nBoth trips to Brasenose Lane can be characterised as legend-tripping,w h i c h\ninvolves ``travelling to a specific location attached to a legend in the hopes of witness-\ning some kind of phenomena as if in the legend itself '' (Koven, 2007, page 186, original\nemphasis). These trips involve improvised drama and a desire for enchantment through\nlegends particular to the site being acted out and retold.Whilst legend trips can be seen\nas performative exploration of local historical geographies, the aim is not to learn and\ndwell on the intricacies of the place (although most guides stress historical accuracy)\nbut to enjoy and become engrossed in the extraordinary possibility of place: ``The aim\nof the legend-trip is not to learn local history but to have the fun of a good `scare'''\n(Hall, 1973, page 147). Legend-tripping thus involves and relies on the importance\nof legend atmosphere and the material or architectural setting for its effectiveness,\nFigure 4. Brasenose Lane in the dark, Oxford (source: author's photograph).\n628 J Hollowayparticularly if the site travelled to has a foreboding appearance: a guide discussed how\nthe mysteriousness garnered on tours comes from ``being surrounded by the buildings\nand so on. So it's actually in that particular building where something has happened.\nIt helps people's imagination to get going'', with another stating, ``we give a lot of time\nand thought to the atmosphere of where we get the group to stand. It has to be a\nlocation that is atmospheric and relevant to the story'', thus underlining the affective\ncapacity and affordance of materiality on the ghost tour.\nThe legend trip is produced through a general sense of receptivity to possibility and\ntemporary communitas wherein all that is asked is that participants ``do not disbelieve''\n(Koven, 2007, page 200). This emergent and shared sense of artifice is a ``complex art'',\nwhere ``the trick to performing in such a context, then, is to say, `This is for real', and\nyet imply exactly the opposite'' (Ellis, 1981, page 505). Modern enchantments therefore\nrely on a movement away from belief or disbelief to a performance of not disbelieving.\nAs we have seen, key to this movement are infrastructural forces and assemblages that\nbuild tension and sensations of anomalous possibility. Viewed in this way, the ghost\ntour as legend trip ``embraces the flux of corporeal sensation and sensory perception\nin the `machinic' connection of embodied spectator with the body of the text'' (Powell,\n2005, page 3) and can, through a desubjectified, affective melding with other material\nforces, succeed in a collective ordering that allows the familiar to bristle with the\nstrange.\nOstensive play and ghostly affect\nThe affective milieu of the legend trip can assemble a sense of being engrossed in the\nsupernatural possibility of the city. Central to the process of legend-tripping and its\nvaried affective registers is the presentational and thus the doing of legend. In what\nDe \u00a8 gh and Va \u00a8 zsonyi (1983) denote as ostension, the presentational and presencing of\nlegend trips is laid bare in that ostension is ``presentation as contrasted to represen-\ntation (showing the reality itself instead of using any kind of signification)'' (De \u00a8 gh\nand Va \u00a8 zsonyi, 1983, page 6). Thus the infrastructural assemblage of tours attempts to\ndramatically extend legend into the everyday spaces of the city through presentation,\n``making it real in the most palpable sense ... [and] bring[ing] the legend to life''\n(Lindahl, 2005, pages 164, 165; Ellis, 2003).(5) Here I wish to explore different modes\nof ostension and the coincidence of ostension with ideas of play. In order to achieve\nthis, I wish to detail an example of an organised ghost hunt.\nOrdsall Hall in Salford sits somewhat uneasily in its surroundings\u00f6a strange piece\nof Tudor history, with a housing estate on one side and industrial units on the other.\nThe first part of the ghost hunt involves orientation, including introductions, schedules,\nand health and safety. We are led round the Hall and given a scant history of it by the\nresident warden\u00f6through the Great Hall with its intricate beams, upstairs to the Star\nChamber, through doors normally closed to the daytime public, to other bedrooms,\nto the plaster room with its ornate but decaying ceiling, back down to the exhibition\ngallery and into the kitchen. The rooms are brightly illuminated and lack that sense of\nwonder and expectation that had occupied us on the journey to the Hall. Indeed, the\nHall is imbued with the securing mundanity of a staged and themed heritage site\u00f6with\n`mock-up' kitchens and kid-friendly exhibitions adorned with scribblings from previous\nfield trips. As one group, we are led by the guide and the invited psychic back through\nthe hall.\n(5) As Ellis discusses (1989), most ostension is benign, but some can be antisocial or even socio-\npathic, by bringing a violent legend to life, ostension can become a map for violent action. I will\nreturn to the somewhat less than benevolent, although arguably not sociopathic, aspects of ghost\ntourism in a moment.\nGhost tourism and infrastructures of enchantment 629And then the lights go out ... .\nOnly recently travelled and manoeuvred space shifts and changes, and we are filled\nby a sense of unease as the layout and dimensions of rooms, doorways, objects, and\nartefacts lose their recently gained familiarity. Open doors leading to rooms just passed\nthrough become spaces of fascination, spaces without inhabitation, spaces filled with\nthe potential for mysterious shapes, outlines, and noises. Space takes on a different\nluminosity. Rooms and staircases are strobed by handheld torches. The darkness alters\nsensory registers. Sight becomes strained as we look round rooms at objects and at\nother ghost hunters. Listening becomes more highly attuned to knocks, taps, breathing,\nand other noises.\nWe are split into two groups and led back to the exhibition galley. We are asked to\nform a circle and join hands for the first of many se \u00a8 ances. Holding hands with\nstrangers suspends normalised orders of embodied relations. Touch takes on a different\nand unusual quality. Eyes shut, and sight is closed down. Directed through the se \u00a8 ance\u00f6\nbreathing techniques, New Age references to light energy\u00f6the pace of the night slows\n(Holloway, 2003). The gallery takes on a new rhythm\u00f6one slowed down and brought\nto stillness. The apprehension of space is heightened and sharpened through nonvisual\nmeans. Only an hour previous I had been looking at some broken Tudor plates in\ncabinets. Now the room becomes a space of the possible and unknown, a space where\nstrange things could occur.\nHaving stood listening intensely in various rooms and had the medium and others\ncall out and sense spirit activity, we were given the chance at glass divination. Similar\nto Ouija boards, this is where an upturned glass is used to communicate with the spirit\nworld. Participants place their fingers on the glass as lightly as possible, and through a\nseries of questions and responses, communication with the spirit world is hopefully\nopened up. I helped carry the ordinary trestle table into the Great Hall and assisted\nin setting it up. We all placed our fingers on the glass and waited. Nothing happened\nfor ten minutes, then ... .\nA sudden movement of the glass.\nFamiliar spatial and practical fields of objects are made radically different, made\nunknown. The material affordance of a glass is transformed, is dislocated. No longer\noffering its normal course of practical action, no longer part of the familiar order of\nthings, the glass registers something unknown. The glass acts back on the bodies of the\ndivination circle; the glass transformed becomes active in territorialising affective\nregisters of shock and wonder. Everyday object-spaces that endure through habitual\naction are made strange and mysterious (Holloway and Kneale, 2008).\nThrough the suspension of the normal, different modes of affect flow through the\nevent. At the moment of its transformation the movement of the glass precipitates and\nreveals its capacity to orientate sensations of indeterminacy. My body registers this\nsudden shift in the configuration of things\u00f6nerve endings tingle round my spine,\nregistering something unusual and out of the ordinary, seemingly without stable mean-\ning. To a degree, at the very instance of transformation the sense of shock and\nconfusion is more acute than that experienced on ghost walks: here, the immediacy\nand sheer viscerality of the unknown emerge with greater amplification due to a\ncomplete lack of the narrative or discursive framing to the event that is evident on\nghost tours. In other words, the strange and unknown are assembled between bodies\nand materialities in an event that seems qualitatively distinct in its charge due to, for\nthe most part, the lack of biography and story delivered by tour guides. Yet just as\nthese sensations emerge and are registered as emotional states of fear and anxiety,\nastonishment and awe, others begin to be territorialised\u00f6the possibility of suspicious\nfoul-play and incredulity, for example. In turn, dialogue between the participants\n630 J Hollowayattempts to register the shock of the extraordinary: ``Wow''; ``Oh my word''; ``That was\namazing''; and ``Jesus Christ!'' We seek to represent and give meaning to the event\nexperienced: ``Did everyone feel that?''; ``No-one's definitely pushing that?'' Representa-\ntion here becomes making sense of this performative presencing of the unreal and\nabnormal emergent from a dislocated materiality.\nThe glass divination reveals that ``as much as we may prefer to think otherwise, we\nlive in an imprecise and ambiguous world, which in its inexactitude allows for the\nawesome, the inexplicable, the wondrous'' (Walker, 1995, page 1). Yet this does not\nnecessarily mean the supernatural is a living reality. Indeed, the movement of the glass\ncan be seen as a shift in normalised relations which does not have to lead to a belief\nor faith in the spirit world. There is then an `other-worldly' sense to the event, but this\nmight be understood in terms of hoax or more seemingly rational explanations, as well\nas more irrational realities. We must be aware then of different modes of ostension in\nthe performance of legend. First, the acting out of ghostly Ordsall Hall via glass\ndivination can be understood for some participants as quasi ostension. Here a prior\nbelief in the spirit world, spiritualism, or ghosts will colour the experience of the ghost\ntour or hunt: a movement of an object in response to calls from the spirit world, whilst\nstill presenting something extraordinary, will be understood by some of those present\nthrough a belief in spiritualism and the reality of the spirit world (Ellis, 2003; Hufford,\n1995; Koven, 2007). Indeed, many of those at Ordsall Hall identified as practising\nmediums or, to varying degrees, holding a certainty that ghosts exist in some form\nor other. Second, the divination event could have involved pseudo ostension. This is\nwhere individuals will engineer the space and practices of the ostensive legend trip to\nperpetuate a hoax. Thus, someone was forcefully moving the glass in order to fool\nthose present into believing that ghostly spirits exist and are in contact. Furthermore,\nin both of these scenarios the notion of modern enchantment as delight without\ndelusion does not seem to hold. For example, the quasi ostension of spiritualist or\nparanormal believers was not enacted with a sense of ironic detachment from the\nphenomenon presented, despite the obvious delight the glass divination engendered.\nThe hoaxing of pseudo ostension would lessen or cancel out the ability to willingly and\nknowingly not disbelieve if discovered.\nHowever, despite these limits to modern modes of enchantment, the openness to\npossibility seen on ghost tours remains an acute part of the performative makeup of\nthe ghost-hunt space. There is, then, a strong element of playfulness involved in the\nostensive action of ghost hunts and ghost tours, particularly if we recognise that\n``playing is not (just) kids stuff'' (Harker, 2005, page 59) and that play is more than\njust part of the teleological development of children towards the endpoint of adulthood\n(Aitken et al, 2007; Binnie et al, 2008; Katz, 2008). Describing this form of tourism as\n`playful' stresses its transformative effects, affects, and role in wider contexts of modern\nenchantment but does not take away from the seriousness of the beliefs engendered\nwhen these events are realised through quasi ostension. Furthermore, as discussed\nabove, these playful moments of transformation (irrespective of whether one is already\na believer or one is merely fooled into becoming one) depend in part on willingness\nto play and thus an open sensibility to the chance of enchantment. Ostensive play,\ntherefore, involves events which allow an opening to ``becoming other'' (Katz, 2008,\npage 98) through the intrusion of the supernatural on the seemingly `natural', relying\non a disposition to play which allows these moments to (sometimes) occur: without\nthis disposition, ostensive play loses its force, the marvellous remains unactualised, and\nenchantment falters.\nHow then does ghost tourism generate playfulness? We have seen how the ghost\ntourism industry engineers an infrastructure which works on affective registers and\nGhost tourism and infrastructures of enchantment 631brings forth enchantment and a playful sense of the unknown\u00f6for example, a tour\noperator commented how ``we do like to get the adrenalin running and entertain\npeople... . We hope the tour is thrilling.'' In so doing, they are not alone in a wider\ncapitalist economy that, as Thrift (2000) argues, has turned to the production of\nexperience and intensification of affect (see Pine and Gilmore, 1999). Thrift discusses\nhow firms (including those of tourism) seek to work on the affective background of\npractice to produce ``new products, products which animate\u00f6`turn on'\u00f6the body by\nproducing an engaging and compelling ethology of the senses'' (2000, page 49). As such,\nghost tourism attempts to produce experiences which``grip the senses''and ``allow forces\nand intensities to be focused and channelled'' (Thrift, 2000, pages 49, 44). This com-\nmodification of qualitative intensity can be seen to be successful when a disposition of\n``a potential for potentiality'' and a playful openness to the supernatural emerges\nthrough the legend trip event (page 39).\nHowever, the engineering of affective responses and states of anticipation must not\nbe seen as working only on a preconceptual, practical, and unconscious intentionality.\nBarnett, in his discussion of Thrift and Connolly on the modulation of affect and\nintensity in the media and politics, rightfully argues that the engineering of affect\ncan also work on a propositional or more conscious and reflective intentionality\nwhich ``allows one to register a commitment to certain values without having to\ndirectly avow norms and principles or present arguments in favour of them'' (2008,\npage 197). In light of the argument in this paper regarding modern enchantment and\nquasi ostension, we can see that propositional intentionality plays a role in the devel-\nopment of a disposition towards and willingness to be enchanted. Put differently, there\nis a ``genealogical freight'' of cultural practice that is brought to the tour or the ghost\nhunt which can modulate the intensity of the event (Thrift, 2000, page 39). This is\napplicable to both those with a serious belief in spiritualism and those who maintain\na sense of delighted but knowing detachment from the proceedings.\nMoreover, this argument moves us away from seeing the manipulation, commodi-\nfication, and engineering of affect as building spectral infrastructures wherein tourists\nand ghost hunters are somehow duped into certain dispositional practices. Both\nthose with prior deeply held beliefs in spirits and life after death and those with a\nwillingness to believe (performed with a reflexive awareness) come to ghost tourism\nwith premeditated dispositions. Thus, ghost tourism is ``good at mobilising people to\nact in ways they are already predisposed toward'' and ``[good] at actually shaping those\npredispositions in the first place and then mobilising them'' (Barnett, 2008, page 194).\nDispositional practices, both preconceptual and intentional, are shaped before and\nduring the tourist events described here in various ways.\nHowever, these practices do not always and everywhere produce benevolence and\nwonder\u00f6one guide described how ``[s]ome nights you get a real reaction, and there's a\nreal energy to the event. Other nights it can be really hard work.'' A common theme\nacross the ghost tours is torture and the suffering body. In both Edinburgh tours, tales\nof the supernatural and the ghostly are somewhat secondary to reports of witch trials,\npublic executions, and murders (most famously the body snatchers William Burke and\nWilliam Hare). So we are told about the execution of robber Robert Johnson on\nDecember 30, 1818, whose hanging was bungled at the first attempt as the rope was\ntoo long and his feet still touched the scaffold. Only on the second attempt, after a near\nriot by the crowd of onlookers and some hasty carpentry, does the guilty die. And we\nare beguiled by stories of the body of water Nor Loch (located approximately where\nPrincess Street Gardens are today) where 300 witch trials took place and many corpses\nwere dumped. Ostension of such narratives is performed through asking tour partici-\npants to try on thumb screws or to stand up against Mercat Cross and enact the public\n632 J Hollowaywhippings of the day (figure 5). Similarly, in Nottingham and Douglas the details of\nbeing hung, drawn, and quartered are acted out on willing volunteers.\nHere the past impregnates the present as affective registers are assembled amongst\nthe participants through thumb screws and other instruments of torture precipitating\ndifferentiated sensations of pain. Once again this ostension in the legend trip is\nperformed in a state and atmosphere of unreality\u00f6a sense of playfulness pervades as\nmost participants laugh, joke, and smile at the performances.Yet the visceral sensing of\nthe torture reenacted points towards a different modulation of affect amongst the tour\nparticipants, one wherein on occasion delight and wonder are replaced by a sense of\ndisgust, immorality, and injustice. Indeed, this becomes arguably problematic when\nsome participants fail to see the entertainment value of the tour during these events.\nFor example, as we moved between locations, a few tourists on the Edinburgh tour\nmade concerned asides about the use of torture on the tour, especially in light of recent\nevents at Guantanamo Bay. Here politicised and intentional dispositions are brought\nto and brought forth on the ghost tour. Such dispositions\u00f6how they are moulded\nand generated and how they affect sensation and reactions in more broader spaces of\ntorture tourism (York, London, and Edinburgh dungeons come to mind here)\u00f6is a\nsubject worthy of further research. If nothing else, however, the playful enactment of\nhistory and legends via torture ostension reveals that ``playing isn't necessarily eman-\ncipatory'' and can be realised as a sense of abhorrence or critical unease instead of\nmarvel and delight (Harker, 2005). The affective attachments and assemblages evoked\nin ghost tourism are thus often extremely unpredictable and varied (Hemmings, 2005);\nthey may enchant, or they may open up a sense of injustice and concern.\nFigure 5. Ostensive play at Mercat Cross, Edinburgh (source: author's photograph).\nGhost tourism and infrastructures of enchantment 633Conclusions\nThe notion of modern enchantment as something ``that delights but does not delude''\n(Saler, 2006, page 702) has been explored in this paper through the widespread emer-\ngence of contemporary ghost tourism. For the most part, modern enchantment is an\napt description of ghost tourism: a sense of reflexive openness to and pleasure in the\nspooky pervades the events discussed here. Whether this modern form of enchantment\nsaturates other encounters with the supernatural or paranormal needs further atten-\ntion. Thus, with the apparent increasing popularity of ghosts and visits to haunted\nsites comes the seemingly ever-present fascination with other phenomena, such as\nUFOs, vampires, religious apparitions, and the various cryptids, such as the Loch Ness\nMonster and the Sasquatch, that lurk in lakes and mountain ranges: the modalities\nof belief through which these and other monstrous forms are made (partial) sense of,\nwhether through modern enchantment or more deeply held dispositions, needs explo-\nration. Despite its more modest aims, this paper has sought to provide a possible\nframework for these studies by exploring the practice, performance, and assemblage\nof enchantment.\nBy developing and drawing on a wider spectral infrastructure, and utilising a whole\nseries of techniques associated with the legend trip and ostension, ghost tourism\noperators seek to mould enchanted affectual registers in conjunction with different\nmaterialities that have the capacity to affect and act on tourists' bodies through the\nmultiple modulation of intensity and enchantment. Thus, the performance of narratives\nand tales at spatial interstices with particular architectural framings and atmospheres\nenacts a relational assemblage of teller and listener where a disposition and willingness\nto be enchanted, comprising of a sense of wonder and awareness of entertaining deceit,\nleads to playful practices of engrossing possibility and indeterminate meaning.\nThe framework developed here, of modern enchantment as a contemporary mod-\nality of experiencing the supernatural and the paranormal, has also complicated the\nargument that these encounters always occur on an affective preconceptual back-\nground lacking in premeditation. Subsequently, for those with a prior assurance in\nthe spirit world, propositional dispositions are brought to bear on ghost tourism, and\ndelighted detachment is replaced by belief. For others with dispositions more attuned\nto the wonders and awareness of modern enchantments, tour operators engineer play-\nfully spooky artifice that at once consciously draws on preformed dispositions and\nproduces such affective backgrounds. Conversely, there are instances where the delight\nof sensing the extraordinary gives way to feelings of injustice and cruelty produced\nthrough already formed politicised dispositions of values and commitments. Here the\nplayfulness of ghostly enchantment gets serious, delight turns to concern over the ethics\nof making a spectacle of torture, and the pleasurable deceits of modern enchantment\nfall away. The commodification of qualitative intensity found in ghost tourism must\nthus be understood as emergent through differing and sometimes conflictual moments\nof modern enchantment, genuine belief, or politicised reaction and critique.\nAcknowledgements.
