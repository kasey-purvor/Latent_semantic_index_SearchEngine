Introduction\nSince the adoption of modern welding techniques for manufacturing aerospace structures,\nevaluation of crack tip stress intensity factors (SIF) resulting from welding induced residual\nstresses has become an indispensable part to the damage tolerance analysis. This so-called\nresidual stress intensity factor (Kres) is required in the prediction of fatigue crack growth rates\nas well as in the residual strength calculations [1-6]. Current analysis methods are based on\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +44 1234 754621; fax: +44 1234 758203.\nEmail address: xiang.zhang@cranfield.ac.uk (X. Zhang)\n2the superposition rule of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). One popular engineering\nmethod is to determine the effective stress intensity factor ratio (Reff) to account for the\nresiduals stress effect [1-2]. An alternative method is based on the crack closure concept\noriginally proposed by Elber [7] by calculating the effective stress intensity factor range\n(\uf044Keff) in a combined stress field of the applied and residual. The validity of both methods has\nbeen generally accepted. Both Reff\uf020 and\uf020\uf044Keff are determined by calculating the Kres and using\nthe superposition method [2-4, 8]. Therefore, the key task is to evaluate the Kres.\nThe weight function method (WFM) and the finite element method (FEM) have been widely\nemployed for calculating SIFs. The former has been successfully used by many researchers\nfor welded test samples [1,5,9]. Closed-form or approximate analytical solutions are available\nfor calculating the Kres and, in general, the solutions are exact or accurate enough. However,\nmost weight functions were developed for simple geometries or require finite width correction.\nSome weight functions are in very complicated forms that the calculation process involves\nsolving complex integral equations. On the other hand, the FEM is a more robust and versatile\ntool for complex geometries and loading conditions. It has been successfully used in the\nfracture analysis in welds [3,10,11]. This method is getting more popular owing to the rapid\ndevelopment of fast computers and implementation of fracture mechanics analysis routines in\nthe commercial FE packages. The most important case is that welded structural components\nare usually in complex geometry for which FEM is more powerful than WFM in evaluating\nthe effect of residual stresses on crack tip stress field. However, although the FEM is used in\nmany studies of Kres for many years and one recent study has shown good agreement with\nWFM calculated Kres for the mid-crack tension geometry [11], the FEM delivered Kres\nsolutions are yet to be validated for further application to complex structural configurations\nand\/or residual stress distributions. There are a few aspects that need to be explored to make\nsure the FE results are correct or acceptable.\nThe objectives of this paper are to validate the FEM by the well-established WFM for simple\ngeometries and to establish good practices and procedures for application of FEM to complex\nwelded structures. The available weight functions and their application in residual stress field\nare summarized firstly. Then, the procedure of evaluating Kres via FEM is described.\nDiscussion is made for the aspects of introducing residual stresses into FE model, dealing\nwith incomplete measured residual stresses and effect of transverse residual stresses. The\nstudy cases include three specimen configurations and various residual stress profiles\nresulting from two welding processes and different crack positions. Comparisons of the two\ndifferent methods are performed in terms of their accuracy, easiness for the users, and\napplication scope and conditions. Computational issues and influential factors in these two\nmethods are also discussed.\n2. Weight function method in residual stress field\n2.1 The concept\nTwo-dimensional plane stress or plane strain problems of a crack length a in an infinite body\nsubjected to an arbitrary symmetrical loading can be solved provided that certain results are\nknown for one symmetrical loading, i.e. displacement of the crack faces, \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029xav ,1 , and the\nstress intensity factor, \uf028 \uf0291\uf049K [12].

Weight function for a 3D surface crack is also available [28]. For\nother configurations, such as a centre crack in a circular disc, double edge crack, multiple\ncracks, etc., corresponding weight functions have been developed by Tada [19], Wu [17], Fett\nand Munz [24] et al. Weight functions of general forms were also proposed by Fett et al. [29],\nand Sha and Yang [30].\n2.3 Evaluating SIF due to welding residual stresses by WFM\n2.3.1 Available SIF solutions\nVarious kinds of weight functions have been applied to determine the intensity of the crack\ntip elastic field for cracks introduced into the residual stress field (including thermal stresses).\nIn the absence of external loads, residual stressed are self-balanced, built-in field, which\nrequire no special treatment when using the WFM. The method is based on the superposition\nprinciple [19].\nThere are some closed-form SIF solutions that are deduced by the WFM. Tada et al. [31]\npresented SIF solutions for various crack-absent residual stress distributions and crack\ngeometries. For example, they used the Green\u2019s function to obtain the SIF solution for centre\ncrack in infinite width plate. When the residual stress distribution is expressed by Eq.

Tada\u2019s and Wu\u2019s\nsolutions are compared in Fig. 3b, which shows that: (1) The SIF results given by Tada and\nWu agree with each other very well when the width of the plate is adequate compared with\nthe distribution of residual stress. (2) For inadequate width ratio, e.g. 4\uf03dcW , although the\n7stress at the edge is almost zero, the width effect could not be ignored; weight functions with\nwidth correction gives more accurate result in this case.\nHowever, weld residual stresses as measured are not always in the single peak form as Fig. 3a\nand Eq. (16) describe. Most cases need numerical integration of Eq. (1). This will be\ndemonstrated through practical examples in Section 4.\n\uf073\uf030\nc-c\na-a\n\uf073(x)\n(a)\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nK\nre\ns\n\/[\n\uf073\n0\n(\uf070\na)\n]\na\/c\nKres of Tada's solution\nKres of Wu's solution (W\/c=4)\nKres of Wu's solution (W\/c=10)\n(b)\nFig. 3 WF solution of SIF given for a given residual stress field; (a) residual stress distribution;\n(b) comparison of Tada\u2019s and Wu\u2019s solutions\n2.3.2 Influence of incomplete residual stress measurement data\nResidual stresses should be self-balanced in the absence of external loads. However, during\nresidual stress measurement experiments tensile residual stresses often attract more attention\nthan compressive stresses. Consequently measured stress distribution is often incomplete and\ndominated by tensile stresses resulting in un-balanced stress field. If the equilibrium condition\nis not fulfilled, evaluated SIF distribution as a whole is in general meaningless. However, in\nsome cases of engineering failure assessment, attention is on crack propagation in the weld\nzone. Thus, if the values of Kres are correct in region of interest, then the assessment is\n8meaningful. The purpose of the work presented in this section is to understand the effect of\nincomplete RS on Kres if measured residual stresses are available only in the crack growth\nregion.\nTwo cases are studied: case 1 is centre crack with a longitudinal weld in the middle of plate,\nFig. 4a; case 2 is edge crack with longitudinal weld, Fig. 4b. For demonstration purpose, the\nanalytical stress distribution in Eq. (16) is used and plotted in Fig. 4; solid and dotted lines\nform a full and balanced stress field. Assumed un-balanced residual stress is achieved by\nlimiting )(x\uf073 to region cxc 1.11.1 \uf0a3\uf0a3\uf02d (solid line); stresses outside this region (dotted line)\nare set to zero. For simplicity and emphasising on the effect of un-balanced stress, effect of\nsample length is not considered. Wu and Carlsson weight function, Eq. (8), is used for case 1,\nand Bueckner\u2019s weight function, Eq. (10), is used for case 2. Normalized SIF values for case\n1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 5a and 5b, respectively, and compared with those SIF solutions due\nto balanced stresses. It indicates that: (1) For the centre crack that has the same symmetric\naxis as the stress distribution, the imbalance of the stresses has no influence on resK while the\ncrack length a is within the boundary of the region where the residual stresses are known. (2)\nFor the edge crack, the result obtained from un-balanced stresses is totally different from that\ngained by balanced stresses. Therefore, for the edge crack geometry full and balanced residual\nstress field is necessary for evaluating residual SIF by WFM. In other words, if a crack is\ncompletely embedded in the region where the residual stress is evaluated or correctly\ninterpolated and the crack and the residual stress distribution have the same symmetric axis,\n(e.g. the centre crack case), then partial knowledge of the stress is not a problem when using\nthe WFM. The required function \uf073(x) is enough for obtaining the correct Kres, and the stresses\nin other regions do not affect the result. However, the problem of partial knowledge of\nresidual stresses arises when the WFM is applied to a crack for which residual stress is known\nonly on a portion of the crack length (e.g. an edge crack). In this case application of the WFM\nneeds the residual stress to be reasonably extrapolated on the whole crack domain and the\nequilibrium condition has to be correctly fulfilled.\ncrack\nweld line\n2W\ncrack\nweld line\n0.4W 0.6W\n(a) (b)\nFig. 4 Balanced and incomplete residual stresses ( cW 10\uf03d ) in (a) centre crack and (b) edge\ncrack samples\n90.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2 Kres from balanced residual stresses\nKres from un-balanced residual stresses\na\/c\nK\nre\ns\n\/[\n\uf073\n0\n(\uf070\na)\n]\n(a)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nK\nres\nfrom balanced residual stresses\nKres from un-balanced residual stresses\nK\nre\ns\n\/[\n\uf073\n0\n(\uf070\na)\n]\na\/c\n(b)\nFig.5 Influence of incomplete residual stress on SIF: (a) centre crack; (b) edge crack.\n3. Finite element method\n3.1 Introduction of residual stresses into FE models\nFor evaluating Kres, it is important to input correct initial stress conditions to numerical\nmodels to characterise measured residual stresses. The function of defining initial stress\ncondition is available in many commercial FE software packages, e.g. ABAQUS subroutine\nSIGINI [32], ANSYS command INISTATE [33]. These initial stresses should be equilibrated\nin the first analysis step to result in zero stresses in model\u2019s free edges and self-equilibrium\ncondition without any constraint. ABAQUS command \u201cUN-BALANCED STRESSES\u201d can\nbe called to do this, while in ANSYS, the initial stress must be applied in the first load step\nand be equilibrated automatically.\n10\nAccording to the experimental measurements, the profiles of weld residual stresses are almost\nidentical along the y-axis that is parallel to the weld line. Therefore, elements with the same x\ncoordinate should have the same initial stress condition. In other words, if the residual stress\ndistribution is expressed by discrete value i\uf073 at ix , ( ni ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d ), initial stress \uf028 \uf029 21 ii \uf073\uf073 \uf02b\uf02d\nshould be introduced to all the elements located within \uf028 \uf029ii xx ,1\uf02d .\nTo obtain correct Kres value, it is necessary to make sure that the resulted stress distribution in\nthe FE model after the equilibrium is in accordance with the measured residual stress field\nwithin an acceptable discrepancy. However, it is not always possible to obtain the same\noutput stress field as the input residual stress. For configurations of relatively short length\nwith respect to the width, such as the C(T) geometry, obtained residual stresses are found to\nbe much lower than inputted values after the equilibrium step. This issue was also mentioned\nin [34].\nAn example is given here to demonstrate the influence of specimen length. The residual\nstress distribution follows eq. (16), letting 10\uf03dc mm, and is introduced to the FE model with\ndiscrete values over every 1 mm distance. Case 1 has the average residual stress \uf028 \uf029 21 ii \uf073\uf073 \uf02b\uf02d\nintroduced to all the elements located within \uf028 \uf029ii xx ,1\uf02d , whereas in case 2 residual stresses are\nonly inputted into the elements within 10\uf03cy mm (to model a short-length specimen). After\nthe self-equilibrium balance, the resultant residual stresses being kept in the FE model of the\ncase 2 is much lower than the actual input values as shown in Fig. 6.\nFig. 6 Input and output of initial stresses\nTherefore, when dealing with the C(T) configuration, the input initial stresses should be\nincreased so that the actual residual stresses in the FE model, after the self-equilibrium step,\ncan match the measured values. In [34], the proportional integral (PI) adjustment, which is\nwidely used in the area of automatic control, was applied to introduce residual stresses into\nFE models. It is a good way to solve this problem. The adjustment equation is:\n11\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029jjj xxxx outputtargetinput1input \uf073\uf073\uf062\uf073\uf073 \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\uf02b (18)\nThe procedure starts with the adjustment step 0\uf03dj and \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029targetinput xx \uf073\uf073 \uf03d , and ends when\nthe agreement between \uf028 \uf029outputx\uf073 and \uf028 \uf029targetx\uf073 is satisfied, where \uf028 \uf029targetx\uf073 is the measured\nresidual stress distribution.\nWelding process also introduces transverse residual stresses. Although, the magnitude of\ntransverse residual stress is usually much smaller than that of the longitudinal residual stress,\nintroducing transverse residual stress to FE model will affect the magnitude of the\nlongitudinal residual stress after the equilibrium step; consequently, evaluated Kres value will\nbe affected. Therefore, it is important to check the output value of the longitudinal residual\nstress in the FE model to make sure that the residual stresses are introduced correctly.\n3.2 Calculating Kres by FEM\nThere are a few methods for evaluating the SIF by FEM, such as the crack tip displacements\nextrapolation, the J-integral, the strain energy approach, e.g. the virtual crack extension\ntechnique. The displacement extrapolation and J-integral methods are widely used practices\nand implemented in commercial FE software packages. However, the J-integral is no longer\npath-independent in the presence of thermal strains, path dependent plastic strains, body\nforces within the integration area, and pressure on the crack surface. Therefore, J-integral\nmethod is not suitable for evaluating SIF due to weld thermal residual stresses. For linear\nelastic analysis, the displacement extrapolation method is a good choice, which is simple and\nstraightforward to obtain the SIF values based on FE results.\nAccording to the LEFM, the crack tip displacement field in the load direction for a 2D\nproblem is [35]:\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d \uf049\uf049\uf049\n2\nsin21\n2\ncos\n222\ncos21\n2\nsin\n22\n22 \uf071\uf06b\n\uf071\n\uf070\n\uf071\n\uf06b\n\uf071\n\uf070\nr\nG\nKr\nG\nKuy (19)\nwhere, yu , r , \uf071 are defined in crack tip coordinate, Fig. 7.\nFig. 7 Coordinate at crack tip and path for displacement extrapolation\nThe SIFs can be calculated from the FE solution according to the displacement extrapolation\nprocedure [34] using Eq.

For example, in the ANSYS code, the \u201cKCALC\u201d command can be\ncalled in the general postprocessor after defining the path. When executing this command,\ncare should be taken to define either the plane stress or plane strain state for a 2D problem. It\nis recommended to use a refined mesh in the region around the crack tip to capture the rapidly\nvarying stress and deformation fields. The singularity elements at the crack tip mesh will\nresult in more accurate SIF for linear elastic problems. However, the embedded procedure in\nANSYS soft package uses the absolute value of the displacement when evaluating SIF via the\n\u201cKCALC\u201d command, the SIF values calculated by ANSYS will always be positive or zero. If\nthe SIF is evaluated by the energy approach (e.g. the J-integral), then the value will also be\npositive or zero. While the influence of residual stresses on the SIF can be either positive or\nnegative as shown in Fig. 5, i.e. resK , which reflects the influence of residual stresses on\ncrack tip stress field, resK is no longer a strict SIF that cannot be negative. To avoid modelling\na nonlinear contact problem, we have used the following method. For negative residual\nstresses, both residual stress and external tension stress are applied to the FE model\nsimultaneously to keep the crack completely open, i.e. 0yu\uf044 \uf03e at any position of the crack\nface. resK is then evaluated based on the superposition principle [35], Eq. (24).\napptotres KKK \uf02d\uf03d (24)\n3.3 Influence of incomplete residual stresses on Kres\nAs mentioned in section 2.3, measured residual stresses are usually incomplete and tension\ndominated, which will result in inaccurate SIF when using the WFM. The same problem\nexists for using the FEM to evaluate resK . Attempts have been made to balance the initial\nstresses artificially when inputting them to the FE models. A equilibrium-based least-squares\nsmoothing method was proposed in [36] to obtain full-field residual stress using a set of\nresidual stress data acquired by neutron diffraction over a limited region. Extensive FE\ncalculations are required when using this method. To facilitate simple engineering\ncalculations, two simple cases of artificially balanced stresses are studied in the present paper\nto demonstrate their influences on the resK . The two geometries used in Section 2.3 and\nshown in Fig. 4 are used, and set W = 100 mm, c = 10 mm, 10 \uf03d\uf073 MPa. The resK results\nfrom four different initial stresses cases are evaluated. Case 1 is the full-field balanced initial\nstress \uf028 \uf029x\uf073 expressed by Eq. (16). Case 2 is the un-balanced case with incomplete \uf028 \uf029x\uf073\nlocated within cxc 1.11.1 \uf0a3\uf0a3\uf02d . These two cases are the same as those discussed in Section\n2.3 for the WFM and shown in Fig. 4. Case 3 and Case 4 are two artificially balanced initial\nstress distributions shown in Fig. 8 (artificial balancing stresses are plotted by dashed lines).\nIncomplete initial stresses are balanced by either concentrated compressive stresses in case 3\n13\nor distributed stresses in case 4. Calculated resK values are compared in Fig. 9. It can be said\nthat: (1) For the region where the initial residual stress is known, calculated resK from un-\nbalanced residual stress (case 2) is lower than the resK values calculated from balanced\nstresses. (2) The artificially balanced initial stress fields give acceptable resK values in the\nregion where initial residual stress is known. (3) For the area where the initial residual stress\nis unknown, the authentic resK cannot be obtained.\n-20 0 20 40\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nx (mm)\n-40\n(a)\n-20 0 20 40\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n-40\nx (mm)\n(b)\nFig. 8 Artificially balanced residual stresses: (a) with concentrated stress (case 3); (b) with\ndistributed stress (case 4).\n14\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nx (mm)\ncase 1\ncase 2\ncase 3\ncase 4\nK\nre\ns\/\n\uf073\n0\n\uf070\n\uf020a\n(a)\n-40 -20 0 20 40 60\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nK\nre\ns\/\n\uf073\n0\n\uf070\n\uf020a\ncase 1\ncase 2\ncase 3\ncase 4\nx (mm)\n(b)\nFig. 9 FE results of resK for cases of different residual stress: (a) centre crack; (b) edge crack.\nThe FE results for the cases 1 and 2 are also compared with the WFM results and shown in\nFig. 10. For the area where residual stress is known, it indicates that: (1) For centre crack\nconfiguration, the WFM calculated resK for the un-balanced residual stress field is exactly the\nsame as that obtained by the self-balanced initial stress, whereas, the FEM results is 5.8%\nlower. (2) For the edge crack configuration, the WFM overestimates the resK , whereas, the\nFEM underestimates the resK if the initial residual stress is un-balanced.\n15\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0 Case 1_WFM\nCase 2_WFM\nCase 1_FEM\nCase 2_FEM\nK\nre\ns\/\n\uf073\n0\n\uf070\n\uf020a\nx (mm)\n(a)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6 Case 1_WFM\nCase 2_WFM\nCase 1_FEM\nCase 2_FEM\nx (mm)\nK\nre\ns\/\n\uf073\n0\n\uf070\n\uf020a\n(b)\nFig.10 Comparison of FE and WF results for balanced (case 1) and unbalanced (case 2)\nresidual stresses: (a) center crack, (b) edge crack.\n4. Case studies - comparison of WFM and FEM\n4.1 VPPA welded AA 2024 M(T) specimen\nThe Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) welding technology has been widely used in the\naerospace industry. Residual stress distributions usually show multiple peaks. VPPA welded\nM(T) and C(T) configurations have been studied by Liljedahl et al [37] in terms of residual\nstress measurement and crack growth prediction. These two test sample geometries and\n16\nmeasured residual stresses are used in this study to compare the FEM with the WFM. Test\nsamples dimensions are shown in Fig. 11. A measured residual stress distribution for the M(T)\nconfiguration was presented in [37] and shown here in Fig. 12a. The residual stress\ndistribution is considered to be symmetric, so it is averaged and mirrored before calculating\nthe resK . For the WFM analysis, residual stress plot was firstly fitted by a multi-peak function,\neq. (25). For the FEM analysis, residual stress profile was artificially balanced (see the dotted\nlines in Fig. 12a).\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf03d\nn\ni\nW\nXCx\ni\ni i\ni\ne\nW\nAyxy\n1\n2\n0\n2\n2\n2\n)(\n\uf070\n(25)\nwhere Ai, Wi, and XCi are fitting parameters, n is the number of peaks.\nThe resK results obtained by the Wu and Carlsson weight function, eq. (8), and the FEA are\ncompared in Fig. 12b. It can be seen from Fig. 12b that the WFM and FEM results agree very\nwell to each other when a < 24 mm (a\/W < 0.6). Since the error of Wu and Carlsson weight\nfunction is said to be less than 1% when 5.0\uf0a3Wa [17], when the crack length is much\nlonger (a\/W > 0.6), FEM gives more accurate evaluation.\n360\n75\nFig. 11 M(T) and C(T) specimens with a longitudinal VPPA weld; C(T) is cut form an M(T)\nspecimen [37]; unit: mm.\n4.2 VPPA welded AA 2024 C(T) specimen\nFor the C(T) geometry, Fig. 11, measured residual stress distribution is taken from [37] and\nshown here in Fig. 13a. Since the C(T) was cut off from the M(T) specimen, the original\nresidual stress distribution should be the same as the M(T). However, cutting has resulted in\nstress redistribution and the measured residual stress field in the C(T) specimen is hence\nasymmetric and compressive at the weld centre contrary to the stresses in the M(T).\nThe redistribution of residual stress can be evaluated by FE analysis, which is in good\nagreement with the measured profile and values. The residual stress distribution introduced to\nthe FE model should be the one before the cutting induced redistribution, i.e. the same as the\nM(T) and then introduce the notch and let the FE to release the stresses for the C(T). For the\nWFM, the residual stress should be the one without the notch (crack-free stresses). The resK\nresults obtained by the Fett and Munz weight function, Eq. (14), and FE calculation for this\ngeometry are compared in Fig. 13b. Notch tip is at x = -10 mm. The WFM and FEM results\nagree with each other very well. The difference at the beginning (notch tip) is due to the\nasymmetric geometry of the CT. The difference in the final part is due to the inherent\nlimitation of the weight function for longer crack lengths.\n17\n-40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n50\n100\n150\nmeasured value\naverage and mirrored\nfit curve\nartificially balanced\nlo\nng\nitu\ndi\nna\nlr\nes\nid\nua\nls\ntre\nss\n(M\nPa\n)\ndistance from weld center x (mm)\n(a)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\ndistance from weld center x (mm)\nK\nre\ns\n(M\nPa\nm\n)\nWFM\nFEM\n(b)\nFig. 12 (a) Longitudinal residual stress distributions; (b) calculated resK in the VPPA welded\n2024 M(T) sample.\n4.3 FSW welded AA 2195 ESE(T) specimen\nFriction Stir Welding (FSW) is an innovative solid-state welding technique developed for the\naerospace applications. Residual stress distribution in the FS welds usually has the character\nof double peaks. Measured residual stress distribution for eccentrically-loaded single edge\ncrack under tension, ESE(T), geometry was presented in [8], from which the specimen\nconfiguration and measured longitudinal residual stress distribution are taken for this study\n18\nand shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15a. Residual stress measurement was conducted after cutting\nthe notch, which results in the asymmetric stress profile. Since the initial stress for both the\nWFM and FEM should be the one without the notch, measured residual stress was mirrored\nfrom right to left and fitted by a multi-peak function with five peaks. Calculated resK by the\nBueckner\u2019s weight function, eq. (10), and FE result are compared in Fig. 15b.

Conclusions and recommended calculation procedures\nAn overview of the WFM and FEM procedures has been performed for evaluating residual\nstress intensity factors. According to the study described in this paper, especially on the\ntreatment of un-balanced residual stresses, inputting residual stresses into FE models and SIF\nsolution of negative residual stresses for the edge crack problem, following conclusions can\nbe drawn:\n1) For the M(T), C(T) and ESE(T) configurations presented in this paper, residual stress\nintensity factor solutions obtained by the WFM and FEM agree very well for a\/W < 0.6. For\nlarger a\/W ratio, the difference between the two methods is caused by the inherent limitation\nof the WFM for longer crack lengths.\n2) FE analysis procedures have been developed and validated by well-established weight\nfunctions; therefore, the FEM can be employed with confidence for longer crack lengths and\nfor more complex geometries and structures.\n3) Incomplete residual stress data have significant influence on the resK distribution\nevaluated by both the WFM and FEM when they are applied to a crack for which the residual\nstress is known only on a portion of the crack length (for instance an edge crack). If an\nincomplete measured stress distribution is artificially balanced, then the resK calculated by the\nFEM is acceptable in the region where the initial residual stresses are known from the\nmeasurement.\nFollowing calculation procedures are recommenced for the FEM:\n1) Measured residual stresses should be firstly processed, e.g. averaged, smoothed, fitted\nand mirrored, etc., before conducting FE analysis to obtain more accurate resK results. This is\nalso recommended for the WFM solution process.\n2) For incomplete or un-balanced residual stress data, adding artificial balancing stress\nwill help to obtain acceptable resK values in the region where residual stresses are known.\n3) In order to maintain self-equilibrium condition without any constraints and keep the\nmodel boundaries free of stresses, it is necessary to apply the \u201cequilibrium\u201d step in FE\npackages after inputting measured residual stresses.\n4) For short-length geometries, higher (than the measured) residual stresses should be\ninputted into the FE model to accommodate the adjustment in the self-equilibrium step.\n5) For cracks located in compressive residual stress field, external stress should be\napplied simultaneously to the residual stress field to make the crack surface completely open\nfor calculating the total SIF. The residual SIF can then be found by the superposition principle.\nAcknowledgements\nR Bao is grateful to the China Scholarship Council for supporting her visit to the Cranfield\nUniversity where this study was performed.
