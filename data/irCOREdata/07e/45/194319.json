INTRODUCTION \nIn the Commission's White Paper on European Governancel and the subsequent \nLaeken2 Declaration, the participation of civil society in the Community method of \ndecision-making was viewed as the primary way of engaging directly with EU citizens. \nThe White Paper accepts that participatory democracy is created from the bottom up \nby 'groups of people dedicated to the disinterested search for the public interest in soci- \nety'.3 This statement recognises that participation goes beyond the pre-legislative \nlobbying process. It suggests that the representation and protection of citizens' inter- \nests requires ex post judicial protection in circumstances where the legislative measure \nbreaches fundamental rights or if its application infringes principles of procedural \npropriety. The only vehicle for such judicial protection at the Community level is para- \ngraph 4 of Article 230 EC, which already provides recourse to individuals who are \n'directly and individually concerned' by an act of the institutions. Direct actions under \nArticle 230 EC are preferable to the indirect protection available in national courts \nwhen a preliminary reference can be made under Article 234 EC. This is because \nnational courts cannot declare a Community measure as being invalid or provide a \nremedy against the Commission. Despite these deficiencies with domestic enforcement \nactions, the Court's judgments have been consistently of the view that the granting of \nlocus standi under Article 230 EC should be narrowly construed and most significantly \ndoes not extend to judicial review actions by representative groups. This is in stark \ncontrast to the practice within the domestic courts of Member States where proxy \nactions have, in recent years, been encouraged. \nDirect actions, under Article 230 EC, now contribute to the increasing workload of \nthe Community Courts.4 The expansion of Community competence is undoubtedly one \nreason for this increase in litigation, but does not fully explain the increase. The rise in \nlitigation has come about despite any relaxation of the requirements for locus standi \nthat are imposed by the Court on non-privileged applicants.5 Although there have been \ndevelopments with regard to the position of the European Parliament,6 the position of \nindividuals or representative groups who are non-privileged applicants has remained \n1 COM(2001) 428 European Governance-A White Paper. 2 Laeken Declaration on the Future of Europe, Dec 2001.

Prior to the Nice Treaty,7 the European Parliament was only \npermitted to protect its own prerogatives8 on the basis that this was intended to promote \ninstitutional balance within the Community.9 How the Parliament will utilise Article \n230 EC, with its elevation to the status of a fully privileged applicant in the Treaty of \nNice,10 remains to be seen. \nThe Court of First Instance\" and Advocate General Jacobsl2 recently argued for a \nrelaxation in the definition of direct and individual concern for non-privileged appli- \ncants.13 Their arguments are based on the premise that it is the role of any court to \nprotect the fundamental rights of all individuals and offer effective judicial protection \nwhen decision makers have breached these rights.14 Both judicial pronouncements \nrecognise that any mature, democratic, and representative system of public law, such \nas the EU, requires rules on locus standi that allow applicants whether individually or \ncollectively, the opportunity to challenge decisions which materially affect them. This \nshould not extend to a challenge by any 'busybody'15 or meddlesome organisation, \nrather it should allow for measured and controlled intervention by individuals, or repre- \nsentative groups that can demonstrate a genuine interest and concern in the contested \ndecision. In addition to protecting fundamental rights, effective judicial protection \nshould also be available in circumstances when procedural impropriety prevents inter- \nested parties participating in the decision-making process and having their voice \nheard.16 It is in such circumstances where the Court has yet to develop consistent \njurisprudence distinguishing between economic and non-economic interests. \n7 This occurred on 1 Feb 2003 after a drawn out ratification process because of the need for \nthe second Irish referendum. \n8 Art 230 (3). \n9 Case 302\/87 European Parliament v Council (Comitology) [ 1988] ECR 5615. The Court of \nJustice declined to follow the view of Advocate-General Darmon who argued that Parliament \nshould be a privileged applicant for the purposes of protecting its right to participate in the comi- \ntology process. However, in Case C-70\/88 European Parliament v Council (Chernobyl) [1990] \nECR 1-2041 less than 20 years later the Court of Justice accepted the institutional balance argu- \nments of Advocate-General Darmon and extended the position of privileged applicant to the \nEuropean Parliament specifically in those circumstances when it seeks to protect its own privi- \nleges.

JUDICIAL REVIEW AS A CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE- \nTHE EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE MEMBER STATES \nAn argument regularly advanced to justify the liberalising of locus standi under Article \n230 EC is that the conditions for access to judicial review in most Member States have \nbeen relaxed in recent years.17 Some Member States, for example Germany and Italy, \nhave always placed judicial review at the centre of their public law process, while other \njurisdictions, such as England, have only relatively recently seen a growth in judicial \nreview actions. In English law the development reflects not only the constitutional \nimportance of judicial review in the public law process, but arguably the greater \nemphasis that has been placed upon the protection of fundamental rights and higher \nnorms, whose infringement courts are not prepared to accept. The English courts are \nalso alive to procedural abuses by public bodies and do not tolerate such behaviour. \nThis contrasts with judicial review before the Court of Justice. The Court has \nrejected the argument that developments within the Member States provide a sufficient \njustification for the relaxation of the locus standi rules.18 The ECJ does not view the \ntwo legal positions as comparable. This is somewhat surprising, as the Court has \nconsistently stressed through its judgments that the values under which it operates are \nbased upon legal principles and traditions that are common to the Member States.19 If \nthe Court adopted this approach towards standing under Article 230 EC, it would both \nreplicate the objective of and operate as an extension to national courts by providing \neffective judicial protection to individuals whose rights or legitimate expectations had \nbeen infringed within a Community context. This would address the difficulties with \nan applicant relying on indirect protection under Article 234 EC where national courts \ncannot provide the remedy sought by an applicant. \nArticle 230 EC requires a non-privileged applicant to establish that the measure is \nof 'direct and individual concern'. The ECJ has consistently stated that this narrow \ndefinition is contained within the Treaty for a reason, and any change will require \nspecific Treaty amendment. Any such amendment is beyond the competence of the \nCourt and in the hands of the Treaty makers.20 The Court's policy is founded on a \n'floodgates' argument, where any relaxation of the criteria for locus standi could lead \nto spurious actions by opportunistic litigants challenging any measure which is merely \ninconvenient.21 The effect would be political gridlock in the Community decision- \nmaking process and a judicial bottleneck in the Court. \nthe Court was adamant that Member States must comply with EC law even if this may cause \neconomic hardship.

The threshold adopted by domestic courts is generally lower than \nthe criteria of direct and individual concern under paragraph 4 of Article 230 EC. For \nexample, under English law, the Supreme Court Act 1981 states that an application for \njudicial review will only be permitted if the applicant can demonstrate a 'sufficient \ninterest in the matter to which the application relates'.22 The English courts have after \nsome initial reservation23 taken a liberal view of what amounts to a 'sufficient interest'. \nThis relaxed approach has produced markedly different decisions to those of the ECJ, \nparticularly in those cases involving surrogate actions. In the ECJ the Plaumann test, \nwhich is consistently applied by the Court since 1963, interprets direct and individual \nconcern as requiring the applicant to demonstrate that the loss suffered is unique to him \nor a limited closed class of persons. By its very nature this requirement makes repre- \nsentative actions very difficult to accommodate within this definition. \nIII. REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS BEFORE THE ENGLISH COURTS \nIn Greenpeace (No 2)24 the issue before the High Court concerned a decision by Her \nMajesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) to grant British Nuclear Fuels Limited \n(BNFL) a variation in its licence to reprocess nuclear waste at its plant in Sellafield, \nCumbria. Greenpeace was concerned with the levels of radioactive discharge and \napplied for judicial review of the decision of HMIP, seeking an order of certiorari to \nquash the respondent's decision to vary the licence. HMIP argued that Greenpeace had \nno standing, as it could not demonstrate sufficient interest in the decision. The High \nCourt rejected this assertion and held that Greenpeace would be permitted to bring a \nrepresentative action. Otton J established the existence of locus standi inter alia on the \ngrounds that 2,500 Greenpeace members lived in the Cumbria region.25 This fact was \nseen as carrying more weight than the presence of 400,000 members of Greenpeace \nliving in the entire United Kingdom. For the High Court, sufficient interest in this case \nwas established through geographical proximity. If compared to the Greenpeace case26 \nbefore the ECJ, it is apparent that this is a lower threshold to satisfy than the Plaumann \ncriteria, which does not accommodate the notion of geographical proximity as a basis \nfor granting locus standi. \nEnglish courts have gone beyond geographical proximity as a basis for granting \nlocus standi. In the Pergau Dam case,27 the court acknowledged that judicial review is \na central part of any democratic system of public law. The Pergau Dam case concerned \nthe legality of a decision by the Foreign Secretary to use the overseas aid budget to fund \n22 Section 31 (3). 23 See, eg, the judgment of Lord Wilberforce in IRC v National Federation of Self-Employed \nand Small Businesses Ltd [1982] 2 AC 617, at 630; and Scheimann J in R v Secretary of State for \nEnvironment Ex parte Rose Theatre Trust Co [ 1990] 1 QB 504, at 520. \n24 R v Inspectorate of Pollution and another, Ex parte Greenpeace Ltd (No 2) [1994] 4 All ER \n329. \n25 Ibid, at 350. 26 Case C-321\/95 Stichting Greenpeace Council (Greenpeace International) v Commission \n[1998] ECR 1-1651, discussed below. 27 R v Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ex parte World Development Movement Ltd \n[1995] 1 All ER 611. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThe Limits of Article 230 EC 999 \nthe building of the Pergau dam in Malaysia. Under the Overseas Development and Co- \noperation Act 198028 the Secretary of State has the power, for the purpose of promot- \ning the development or maintaining the economy of a country or territory outside the \nUnited Kingdom, to furnish any person or body with financial or technical assistance. \nThe World Development Movement (WDM), a pressure group concerned with the \ndistribution of aid to developing countries, challenged the government's decision to \nfund the building of the dam on the basis that it was not good value for the British \ntaxpayer and the building of the dam itself was not a beneficial project to the Malaysian \neconomy. The High Court held that, on its proper construction, section 1 of the Act \nonly permitted funding which was economically sound.29 As to the question of whether \nthe WDM had standing to challenge the decision of the Secretary of State, the judg- \nment of the court must be seen as progressive.30 Focusing on the constitutional role of \njudicial review, Rose LJ extended significantly the notion of sufficient interest, \narguably beyond that seen in Greenpeace No 2. \nIn his judgment Rose LJ placed a great deal of emphasis on the concept that in a \nsystem of public law, judicial review plays a fundamental role in securing effective \naccountability of the executive in relation to substantive policy choices and ensuring \nprocedural fairness. In Pergau Dam Rose LJ addressed this question of accountability \nby concluding that, if the WDM could not bring this judicial review of the Secretary of \nState's decision, then no alternative challenger would exist.31 In this respect, when \ndeciding on the question of standing, Rose LJ examined the merits of the action in addi- \ntion to considering procedural questions as set out in the rules of court.32 The judgment \nof Rose LJ referred approvingly to the dissenting judgment of Diplock LJ in the ex \nparte Federation of Small Businesses case.33 Lord Diplock some 14 years earlier put \nforward the opinion that judicial review is more than a mere mechanical exercise; \nrather, it serves a specific constitutional function within the public law process. His \nLordship stated that: \nIt would in my view, be a grave lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group, like \nthe Federation or even a single spirited taxpayer, were prevented by outdated technical \nrules of locus standi from bringing the matter to the attention of the court to vindicate the \nrule of law and get unlawful conduct stopped.34 \nIt is clear therefore that for both Diplock and Rose LJs, judicial review is a mecha- \nnism by which the rule of law is maintained and the legality of executive actions is \nguaranteed. In Pergau Dam, the WDM were granted standing to bring a representative \naction on behalf of the British taxpayer. As a respected and long-standing pressure \ngroup with a particular interest in the issue of overseas aid, Rose LJ concluded that the \nWDM was the ideal body to bring this challenge. Furthermore, this made the challenge \nall the more credible as their knowledge and expertise distinguished them from so- \ncalled mischief-makers or meddlesome busybodies. WDM was not an opportunistic \nlitigant. This is an important point and places clear blue water between the English \ncourts and the European Court of Justice. This issue will be considered further below. \nIn Pergau Dam, Rose LJ provided three specific reasons for his decision to grant \n28 Section 1. 29 Rose LJ discussed this issue at 626-7. \n30 See A Tomkins, 'Judges Dam(n) the Government', vol 7, King's College Law Journal \n(1996-7) 91. \n31 At 619. 32 See Order 54 Rules of the Supreme Court. \n33 See n 21 above. 34 At 620. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n1000 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nlocus standi. First, he stated that the merits of the case are crucial and quotes Professor \nSir William Wade's words in Administrative Law:35 'the real question is whether the \napplicant can show some substantial default or abuse, and not whether his personal \nrights or interest are involved.'36 \nProfessor Wade's assertion goes to the central issue of the Court vindicating the rule \nof law through their judicial review function and this opinion clearly influenced the \nCourt. Secondly, his Lordship highlights the lack of any other responsible challenger37 \nwhich would leave a vacuum in the accountability of the executive. Thirdly, Rose LJ \nturns his attention to the credibility of the WDM itself.38 Though not actively part of \nthe consultation or decision-making process in the course of events that lead to the \nSecretary of State's decision, his Lordship stressed that the WDM regularly played a \nprominent role in giving advice and assistance to governments and international organ- \nisation such as the European Union and the United Nations. This third reason is partic- \nularly interesting because despite being involved in such affairs, the WDM, or perhaps \nmore accurately its members, were not personally affected by the decision to the build \nthe dam in the way that the residents in Greenpeace No 2 were. In this judgment, Otton \nJ attached significant weight to the fact that 2,500 members of Greenpeace lived in \nCumbria and would be directly affected by any radioactive discharge. No such \ngeographic nexus existed in Pergau Dam, leading to the conclusion that surrogate \nactions will be permitted before the English courts when an applicant can establish that \nthere is an interests of justice argument to permit a challenge. \nThese developments in the English courts demonstrate that effective judicial review \nwill not necessarily inhibit the process of government, but rather that judicial review is \npart of good government, and permitting a challenge to an executive decision does not \nautomatically mean that the decision will be set aside. In this sense judicial review \noperates as an integral part of the system of checks and balances that are essential \nwithin any system of public law. The English experience in recent years displays no \noverwhelming evidence that applicants have abused judicial review proceedings and \nthat there has been a growth in 'busybody' litigation. Procedural guarantees require \napplicants to establish a prima facie case before they can come before the court. In fact \nwhat is apparent from cases such as Greenpeace (No. 2) and Pergau Dam is that in both \ndecisions the English court stressed that each pressure group was a respected and influ- \nential organisation and that it welcomed informed and targeted proxy actions by such \npressure groups on grounds of efficiency and expediency.39 \nIV. JUDICIAL REVIEW BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE \nIf the national courts have been prepared to accept surrogate actions involving public \ninterest litigation, the ECJ remains hostile to this concept.40 The ECJ is consistently of \n35 8th edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) . 36 Ibid at 712. \n37 A similar argument was put forward by Orton J in Greenpeace (No 2). \n38 At 620. \n39 For further discussion of these issues see C Harlow, 'Public Law and Popular Justice' (2002) \n65 MLR 1. \n40 See the judgment of the Court in Unidn de Pequeiios Agricultores v Council, at para 29. \nThis hostility can be traced back to the early years of the EC. See, eg, Cases 16 & 17\/62 \nConfrddration Nationale des Fruits et Producteurs des Fruits et Legumes v Council [ 1962] ECR 471. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThe Limits of Article 230 EC 1001 \nthe opinion that a representative group could not fall within the ambit of the Plaumann \ntest criteria for individual concern. This raises the question of why the ECJ is so intent \non maintaining this unreceptive stance towards representative actions?41 The flood- \ngates argument has already been identified as one justification of the Court. Scepticism \nwith this view must be expressed, as courts within the Member States do not appear to \nhave experienced any significant abuse of judicial review where the rules on locus \nstandi are relaxed.42 Representative actions have in many jurisdictions been encour- \naged, as they prove to be both efficient in terms of financial resources and judicial \ntime.43 \nDespite this reluctance towards permitting class actions, the ECJ has, on occasion, \nused Article 230 EC to promote institutional balance, which it stated was inherent in \nthe EC Treaty by protecting the 'prerogatives' of the European Parliament. This despite \nArticle 230 EC not containing any reference to 'institutional balance' as a ground for \njudicial review. In the Chernobyl case,44 the Parliament sought an annulment of a \nCouncil Regulation which it argued had been adopted under an incorrect legal base. At \nthe time the European Parliament was not included in the Treaty as a privileged appli- \ncant. Yet the Court through teleological reasoning filled what it viewed as a vacuum in \nthe Community's legal order.45 The Parliament had been given rights of consultation \nunder the Treaty and the Court concluded that those rights would be undermined if the \nParliament could not bring judicial review proceedings in its own right to protect them. \nGranting locus standi to the Parliament on this occasion did not provide some carte \nblanche to challenge any action which may adversely affect Parliament's interests \ngenerally. It related only to those occasions when the Treaty provided for a particular \nlegislative procedure to be followed and where the Parliament could demonstrate that \nits prerogatives had been infringed through use of the incorrect decision-making \nprocess.46 \nThis Chernobyl judgment was a measured and targeted extension of Article 230 EC \nand intended to improve accountability of the decision-makers and prevent abuse of the \ndecision-making process.47 It demonstrates the Court's maturity and understanding of \nthe constitutional function which is expected of it. The Court's decision did not open \nthe floodgates and the judgment stated explicitly the boundaries within which the Court \nwould accept a challenge by the Parliament. At Maastricht, the Treaty makers noted the \nconstitutional significance of the Court's judgment through the introduction of amend- \nments to Article 230 EC.48 This allowed the Parliament to bring judicial review \n41 The call for an extension of the right to locus standi before the European Court of Justice is \nnot a new phenomenon and has been advanced by several commentators a a part of the solution \nto the EU's democratic deficit. See, eg, C Harlow, 'Towards a Theory of Standing for the \nEuropean Court of Justice' (1992) 12 Yearbook of European Law 213 and D Feldman, 'Public \nInterest Litigation and Constitutional Theory in Comparative Perspective' (1992) 55 MLR 44. \n42 Advocate General Jacobs also expressed scepticism with the floodgates argument in his \nOpinion in Unidn de Pequeiios Agricultores v Council. See paras 75-81. \n43 See n 39 above, at 8-11. \n44 See n 9 above. \n45 In fact the Court adopted the view given in the Opinion of Advocate-General Darmon in the \nComitology case, who similarly argued for a specific extension to Art 230 EC to allow Parliament \nto protect its own prerogatives.

In this case, \nthe Court led and the politicians followed. The fact that Parliament had already been \nsuccessful in its action with no obvious detrimental effects upon either the efficiency \nof decision-making or on the Court's workload made such a Treaty amendment all the \nmore logical and easier. The Court in Unidn de Pequefios Agricultores recently stated \nthat if there are to be any changes to paragraph 4 of Article 230 EC then this is a matter \nexclusively for the Treaty makers.49 The Chernobyl case and subsequent Treaty \namendments at Maastricht seem to advocate the contrary and suggest that when consid- \nering modification to the Court's jurisdiction the Treaty makers will look for guidance \nfrom the judiciary. \nThe Court in Chernobyl was explicit that it would police closely applications \nbrought by the Parliament. Consequently the Court stated that any action for annulment \ninitiated by the Parliament would only be admissible where it sought to 'safeguard its \nprerogatives and that it is founded only on submissions alleging their infringement'.50 \nArguably such a condition has, at a superficial level, a similar objective to the \nPlaumann test of individual concern. The Court's judgment suggests a lower threshold \nfor the Parliament to satisfy to permit the challenge, because in Chernobyl, the breach \nwas seen as being too important to ignore. The Court overlooked the formal require- \nments of standing and focused on the substantive issue of promoting institutional \nbalance--concluding that permitting this action was of greater necessity than a literal \nreading of Article 230 EC. With the entry in to force of the Nice Treaty, the question \nof what comes within the Parliament's prerogatives is now redundant. \nThe question of principle which the Chernobyl judgment raises today, is whether \nthe Court could adopt a teleological approach with regard to representative actions and \ntheir objective of promoting accountability? The efficiency of such actions has already \nbeen identified in Member States and is not in dispute. It is in the interests of the Court \nto hear informed and targeted challenges by one pressure group representing several \nindividuals who share a particular concern. Professor Harlow categorises this growth \nof representative actions in the Member States as a form of 'popular democracy' which \nsatisfies and insatiable appetite for transparency and democracy.5 In many respects, \npermitting responsible proxy actions would not be dissimilar from the objectives that \nthe Court sought in the Chernobyl case, where it filled a legal vacuum that undermined \nthe accountability of decision-makers. The Court's judgment in Greenpeace illustrates \nthe paradox that has become evident in the Court's approach to judicial review actions. \nPerhaps the most striking part of the Greenpeace judgment is that the Court was not \nprepared to permit the challenge in circumstances where there was strong opposition to \nthe project, not only from Greenpeace, but also from numerous local residents and in \ncircumstances where there was clear procedural impropriety. \nV. REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS BEFORE THE ECJ--THE GREENPEACE CASE \nThe case before the ECJ concerned an appeal by Greenpeace against an order of the \n49 Judgment of the Court, para 45. \n50 Ibid, para 27. \n51 See Harlow, at 39 above, at 16. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThe Limits of Article 230 EC 1003 \nCFI that neither Greenpeace or the local residents of the Canary Islands could bring a \ndirect action under Article 230 EC to challenge the award of Commission funding for \nthe building of two powers stations on the Canary Islands.52 The construction of the \npower stations was to be financed, in part, by a grant from the European Regional \nDevelopment Fund which is allocated according to the criteria that are laid out in \nRegulation 2052\/88. Of most relevance to this challenge were the provisions of Article \n7 which state that: \nmeasures financed by the funds shall be in keeping with the provisions of the Treaties, with \nthe instrument adopted thereto and with Community policies, including those concerning \nwith [inter alia] environmental protection. \nBefore the project could commence there was a requirement, both under domestic and \nCommunity law, that an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) should be carried \nout. No such assessment was commissioned and the first of four annual grants was paid \nto the Spanish government in 1993. Greenpeace commenced a challenge based on this \nfailure to carry out the EIA and to stop payment of the second instalment of money \nbefore the Spanish Administrative Court. \nThe Spanish court dismissed the action and in support of this decision Advocate \nGeneral Cosmas stated that such a challenge would not be permitted in national courts \non the grounds that an indirect challenge to a Commission decision cannot be dealt \nwith, even indirectly through Article 234 EC, by domestic courts.53 The Spanish court \ncould control domestic administrative action and whether an EIA was carried out, but \nlacked the competence to provide a remedy on the substantive issue of the challenge, \nthat of the decision by the Commission to continue financing the project in the absence \nof an EIA. \nThe applicants based their challenge on the failure to follow the provisions of the \nEnvironmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive,54 prior to what they considered an \nincorrect decision by the Commission to award the funding. The applicants brought \nthis fact to the attention of the Commission through correspondence and in meetings \neven after the project had already commenced.55 In the light of this incorrect procedure, \nGreenpeace argued that the Commission should have suspended the payment of the \nsecond instalment of funding for the project, pending a comprehensive review. When \nthe Commission refused to do this, the applicants initiated their challenge before the \nCFI, which rejected their application on the ground that Greenpeace was not directly \nor individually concerned within the Plaumann formula. The applicants appealed to the \nECJ. \nIn his Opinion Advocate General Cosmas reviewed the state of the case law with \nregard to the application of Article 230 EC. The crucial question for him in this respect \nwas whether Greenpeace, acting in a representative capacity, could on the facts be \ndifferentiated from all other affected persons?56 The key issue the Advocate General \nidentified concerned the question of participation by the applicants in the decision- \n52 For an annotation of the Greenpeace judgment, see F Berrod, (1999) 36 CMLRev 635. \n53 ECR 1-1653, at 1681, para 74 \n54 Directive 85\/337\/EEC of the Council, 27 June 1985, OJ 1985, L175\/40. \n55 Though the relevant competent Spanish authorities conducted an impact assessment of the \nproject, this did not occur until over one year after the project had commenced. 56 Opinion of Advocate General Cosmas at para 76. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n1004 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nmaking process.57 In addressing this question Advocate General Cosmas considered in \ngreat detail the issue of participation by various organisations and individuals in the \nlobbying and decision-making process within the Community and focused particularly \non the substance and nature of that participation. \nThe applicant's view was that their participation, through making representations \nand providing evidence to the Commission on the effects of not carrying out the EIA, \nwould give them standing to challenge the Commission's decision. However, the ECJ \nrejected this by stating that the submissions made by Greenpeace were unsolicited and \ntherefore could not be considered as part of the 'formal' consultation process. In the \nCourt's opinion, for Greenpeace to be granted locus standi, the Commission would \nhave to request Greenpeace to provide evidence, which would, according to the Court, \nplace them within the contemplation of the decision-maker, thereby making them \ndirectly and individually concerned.58 In Greenpeace, where the consultation process \nwas an open one, the Commission chose not to consult with Greenpeace. \nThe purpose of the EIA Directive is to protect the 'public concerned'59 through the \nestablishment of formal consultation procedures. However, the concept of the 'public \nconcerned' is very broad and is not accurately defined by the directive. The ECJ stated \nthat the concept of the public concerned is a matter for the national courts but the \nSpanish court had already dismissed the domestic application for judicial review on the \ngrounds that it was not within its competence to award a remedy against the \nCommission. In the light of this, and given the lack of a precise definition within the \ndirective, it is inappropriate to consider the 'public concerned' as being able to encom- \npass the principle of the closed class within the Plaumann formula. The ECJ refused to \nextend the reasoning applied in competition cases where there was a failure to follow \nprocedural requirements contained within a regulation in relation to the making of a \nCommission decision,6? to those where the procedural requirement is contained within \na directive. Most significantly for the Court, whereas persons affected by a \nCommission decision directed specifically at them can be considered as members of a \nclosed class, those affected by a failure under a directive--which is a general legisla- \ntive measure-cannot be part of a closed class.61 Therefore where a directive is \nconcerned, the ECJ concluded there could never be a closed class within the Plaumann \nformula. \nThe Court analysed this issue by considering the applicants' contention that in terms \nof environmental policy, which affects people generally, there could never be a 'closed \nclass'. For Greenpeace, the distinguishing feature of environmental interests is that \nthey are shared values within the Community which need respecting and defending and \nthis alone should justify the award of locus standi. The Court strongly rejected this \nargument on the basis that this reasoning merely concluded that the applicants were \naffected in a general and abstract manner which did not distinguish them from any \nother potential challenger. Following established case law, the Court concluded that the \napplicants required no special consideration when the Commission made its final deci- \nsion because Greenpeace had not participated in the decision-making process. Though \n57 Ibid, para 79. \n58 Judgment of the Court, at para 28. \n59 Preamble to Council Directive 85\/337 EEC. \n60 See, eg, Case 26\/76 Metro v Commission [1977] ECR 1875. 61 Judgment of the Court, at paras 28fi9. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThe Limits of Article 230 EC 1005 \nGreenpeace was unsuccessful in its challenge, the Court's judgment appears, superfi- \ncially at least, to rely less on the notion of the closed class by suggesting that standing \nwould be granted when the decision maker contemplates an applicant. This interpreta- \ntion is a false dawn for two reasons. First, the limited definition of participation offered \nby the Court to cover only those invited by the Commission to participate in the deci- \nsion-making process, maintains the idea of some form of closed class. Secondly, the \nchallenge by Greenpeace was based upon the failure to follow the correct procedure \nwithin a directive, which led to the award of the funding. The EIA Directive, being a \ngeneral legislative, was not open to challenge by a non-privileged applicant. The net \nresult was, that on the facts of this case, no judicial review of the Commission's deci- \nsion took place. \nVI. THE GREENPEACE FALLOUT \nThe Advocate General and the Court both stressed that an invitation to participate in \nthe consultation process was necessary within the framework of the EIA Directive if \nGreenpeace was to be awarded standing. Greenpeace, a case concerning what can \nloosely be defined as 'social rights', may be distinguished from anti-dumping or \ncompetition cases such as Cofaz62 and Extramet.63 In these cases, procedural guaran- \ntees within the secondary legislation granted the affected party an opportunity to make \nformal representations to the Commission as a way of protecting their economic \nrights.64 In Greenpeace there was no equivalent guarantee for the applicants or any \nother pressure group to make representations to the Commission. This meant that their \nunsolicited submissions gave them no additional privileges over any other potential \nchallenger.65 \nWithin the context of the Plaumann formula, this was a significant issue for the \nCourt. The Court rejected the argument advanced by the applicants that their action, \nwhich sought compliance with Community environmental legislation, filled a legal \nvacuum.66 The applicants argued that environmental interests of the type they sought \nto protect were 'common and shared'67 and that the rights relating to those interests are \nliable to be held by a potentially large number of individuals. In effect the applicant's \nargument challenged the objectives of the Plaumann formula. Plaumann requires that \nthe applicant differentiate himself from all other persons before standing is granted. \nGreenpeace was in fact arguing the contrary. Their submission was based on the asser- \ntion that the presence of a 'popular concern' against the building of the power stations \nshould in itself be a justification for judicial review. This is in stark contrast to cases \ninvolving economic rights where Commission inquiries into a relevant product market \nwill only concern a limited number of companies, making compliance with the \nPlaumann formula much easier. The argument advanced by Greenpeace is therefore \nnot one of exclusivity but rather one which is based on seeking to protect shared inter- \nests and rights. \nThis argument is quite a powerful one. If we consider again the Greenpeace No 2 \n62 Case 169\/84 Cofaz v Commission [1986] ECR 391. 63 Case 358\/89 Extramet Industries v Council [1991] ECR 1-2501. \n64 eg, such procedural guarantees are contained within Council Regulation 4064\/89.

In a democratic system of public law, this is not an \neffective or satisfactory model for judicial accountability of decision-makers. \nFurthermore, the Greenpeace judgment reinforces the notion that the EU is remote \nfrom its citizens. Following the Court's decision, the Canary Islanders have to live with \ntwo power stations that the majority did not want. \nThe Greenpeace case demonstrates moreover that decision-making within the \nCommunity still lacks transparency. If we consider the issue before the Court more \nclosely this will become apparent. The initial decision to fund the project was taken in \n1990. This was at a time when environmental concerns were very much at the top of \nthe Community's policy agenda. The Court had already recognised the importance of \nenvironmental policy in cases such as the Danish Beer Cans68 case, where it concluded \nthat environmental policy could be a permissible mandatory requirement under Article \n28 EC. \nThe issue of transparency originates directly from the consultation process itself. \nGreenpeace was excluded from the formal exercise and merely made unsolicited repre- \nsentations. The question of individual concern ultimately turns on this fact. It seems \nunreasonable that on this reasoning, judicial review proceedings can only be instigated \nby a group or by individuals who were part of the formal consultation process. Such an \nexclusionary view of Article 230 EC results in those not being asked to participate, but \nwho are directly affected by the decision, not having any effective right of redress. By \ncomparison with the English court's decision in Pergau Dam where standing was \nawarded because of the lack of any other responsible challenger, the Greenpeace judg- \nment does raise cause for concern that accountability of decision-makers before the \nCourt of Justice is limited to those who would be in any event unlikely to challenge, \ngiven their already privileged participation in the consultation process. \nIs there any way to mitigate against this harsh impact of the Plaumann formula? \nClearly some interest in the measure to be challenged must remain an important pre- \nrequisite for an applicant to establish before the challenge may proceed. One solution \ncould be for the Commission to draw up a formal list of pressure groups that are experts \nin their particular field. However, such a list is arbitrary and still focuses on the issue \nof the 'class' of applicant. In effect this would do no more than create a wider 'closed \nclass' of non-privileged applicant. Advocate General Cosmas himself was not in favour \nof such an approach as it created the possibility for any group of individuals to organ- \nise themselves in to a pressure group merely for the purposes of fulfilling the criteria.69 \nA second solution could be to develop a sectoral approach to judicial review. For \nexample, environmental issues as in Greenpeace could be classed as 'environmental \nrights' which, because they are considered to be a fundamental Community policy, \ncould be challenged by any interested party before the Court.70 In effect this would \n68 Case 302\/86 Commission v Denmark [1988] ECR 4607, at para 9. 69 Opinion of Advocate General Cosmas, at para 117. \n70 In the context of environmental matters before the Court there are several other cases of \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThe Limits of Article 230 EC 1007 \nmake environmental policy a 'privileged class of issue'71 that could be brought auto- \nmatically before the Court. The Aarhus Convention on public access to environmental \ninformation will add further weight to this argument. The Convention, when imple- \nmented by the EU, will replace the 1990 Directive72 on access to environmental infor- \nmation by creating a right, as opposed to merely freedom of access, to environmental \ninformation.73 This development reinforces the argument that environmental rights \nhave acquired a 'special status' within the EU. The proposed Directive74 will give a \nright of access to environmental information and a right to challenge certain types of \nenvironmental licensing decision.75 The inclusion of such rights will place an onerous \nduty on the Court to protect these rights absolutely76 and is what pressure groups such \nas Greenpeace will strive for. Though some commentators will welcome this develop- \nment,77 it is not without difficulties. The elevation of environmental protection to the \nstatus of environmental right will inevitably lead to value judgements about which \nother Community policies could have an extended definition of a 'right' attributed to \nthem. It must also be borne in mind that within the context of environmental protec- \ntion, not all projects will necessarily be uniformly perceived as breaching an individ- \nual's environmental rights. The notion that shared environmental values exist within \nMember States or the EU can be overstated. For example, if the local community for \nwhom a project were proposed was to be divided on the project's potential and bene- \nfit, how should the Court decide upon the question of which rights to protect and \nwhether to permit a review of the decision to approve the project? Would those \nopposed to the development have an automatic right of challenge? If so what redress is \nleft for those who support the venture? These are questions that remain outstanding and \nwhile the Aarhus Convention may offer a partial solution to the problem of standing in \ncases involving environmental issues, it fails to provide a universal solution to the \nproblems with Article 230 EC when environmental protection is not at issue. \nOne alternative solution could be to draw upon the recent developments in English \nadministrative law. If we consider the statement of Sir William Wade,78 it is apparent \nthat he views the abuse or impact of the measure on the individual(s) as the crucial \nissue. The applicant's status would, under such criteria, be a secondary consideration. \nfailed attempts by NGOs to review Community measures. See, eg, Case T-461\/93 An Taisce v \nCommission [1994] ECR 11-733; Case T-219\/95R Danielsson v Commission [1995] ECR 11-3051. \n71 See Berrod above, at 50. 72 Council Directive 90\/313 on freedom of access to environmental information, OJ 1990 \nL158\/56. \n73 For a further discussion on the impact of the Aarhus Convention on EU environmental law \ngenerally see J Scott, 'Law and Environmental Governance in the EU' (2002) 51 ICLQ 996. \n74 Proposal from the Commission of 29 June 2000 for a Directive on public access to environ- \nmental information, OJ 2000 C337\/156. \n75 Under Art 9 (1) of the Aarhus Convention there is a requirement that the rules on standing \nmust be consistent with the objective of giving the public wide access to justice to any person who \nconsiders they have had their right to information violated. However, the Convention does not \naddress procedural questions which are still left entirely in the hands of the signatories. \n76 See R Macrory and S Turner, 'Participatory rights, transboundary environmental gover- \nnance and EC law', 39 (2002) Common Market Law Review 489, at 519. \n77 See, eg, L Kramer, 'Public Interest Litigation in Environmental matters before the European \nCourts' (1996) 8 Journal of Environmental Law 1; N Gerard, 'Access to Justice in Environmental \nMatters-A Case of Double Standards' (1996) 8 Journal of Environmental Law 139, and Scott \nabove at n 73. \n78 At n 36 above. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n1008 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nThis solution is not dissimilar from the Opinions of Advocates General Jacobs and \nLenz who in Extramet and Cordoniu79 respectively, both stressed the need to examine \nthe impact or effect of the measure on the applicant. The primary point which arises \nfrom these two Opinions is that an individual can be substantially affected by a \nmeasure, but this effect may not necessarily be unique. Exclusivity should therefore not \nbe the primary consideration when deciding whether to grant locus standi. \nIn Greenpeace, the applicants established a legitimate argument that the Plaumann \ncriteria were inappropriate and actually undermined the application of Community \nenvironmental policy. It appears to be inconsistent to make environmental policy a \ncentral Community objective, yet not permit established and experienced pressure \ngroups from initiating an informed challenge to a failure to fulfil the procedural \nrequirements contained within the EIA Directive. This decision also raises difficulties \nin the light of the EU's attempts to increase participation by citizens in the activities of \nthe EU. The Greenpeace judgment suggests that the Commission could ignore opin- \nions that it has not asked for, leading perhaps to the cynical conclusion that only those \ngroups who share the Commission's views will be asked to provide their opinions. \nVII. GRANTING LOCUS STANDI TO PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS - \nTHE WAY FORWARD? \nThe Court's judgments have consistently demonstrated a willingness to protect the \neconomic rights of an applicant where a Commission decision has significantly \naffected their commercial status. For example, in Cordoniu the ECJ placed protection \nof the applicants' intellectual property rights at the centre of its decision and arguably \nthis was viewed as more important than the procedural requirements of Article 230 EC. \nIs there scope within Article 230 EC and the Courts jurisprudence to adopt a form of \nrights based approach to the protection of fundamental non-economic rights, for exam- \nple, environmental protection? \nSuch an argument is strengthened by two specific developments. The first is the \npivotal position which environmental protection has already attained in the EU and in \nparticular through its inclusion as a specific right within the Fundamental Charter of \nRights.80 The second development, also arising from the Charter, is that Article 47 of \nthe Charter contains the right to an effective remedy for all EU citizens.81 Could an \napplicant seeking to protect the right to a high level of environmental protection, in \ncircumstances, such as in Greenpeace, invoke Article 47 of the Charter?82 \nIn the recent Opinion of Advocate General Jacobs in Uni6n de Pequeiios \nAgricultores v Council and the CFI's judgment in Jdgo-Qudre et Cie SA v Commission \n79 Case C-309\/89 Cordoniu SA v Council [1994] ECR 1-1853. \n80 Art 37 states that 'A high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the \nquality of the environment must be integrated into the policies of the Union and ensured in accor- \ndance with the principle of sustainable development.' It is worth noting though that the Charter \nincludes reference to a large number of social rights which could all be subjected to similar \nconsiderations as those advocated by the CFI and Advocate General. See n 87 below. \n81 The effective protection of a citizen's fundamental rights has already been acknowledged by \nthe Court, where the rights contained within Art 13 of the ECHR for effective judicial protection \nhave readily been protected by the Court of Justice. See, eg, Case 222\/84 Johnston v Chief \nConstable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [ 1986] ECR 1651. \n82 See AW Bradley, 'Administrative Justice: A Developing Human Right' (1995) 1 European \nPublic Law 347. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\nThe Limits of Article 230 EC 1009 \nexpress reference was made to Article 47 of the Charter, that individuals should have \nthe right to an effective remedy, in all circumstances, when their rights have been \ninfringed by the decision-makers. For the Advocate General, this right was viewed as \nan overriding principle that every Court must endeavour to protect. Advocate General \nJacobs stated at paragraph 39: \nThat principle [of an effective remedy] is, as the Court has repeatedly stated, grounded in \nthe constitutional traditions common to the Member States and in Articles 6 and 13 of the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. Moreover, the Charter of fundamental rights of \nthe European Union, while itself not legally binding, proclaims a generally recognised \nprinciple in stating in Article 47 that 'everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by \nthe law of the Union are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal'. \nThe CFI was equally enthusiastic about the Charter stating that Article 47 guarantees \npersons an effective remedy enabling them to contest the legality of Community \nmeasures of general application which directly affects their legal situation.83 What is \nmost apparent from these references to Article 47 is that both the Advocate General and \nthe CFI reject the restrictive numerical requirement of individual concern and are \nsuggesting that whenever fundamental rights are infringed, an individual must be enti- \ntled to a remedy, irrespective of the number of persons affected.84 The CFI agreed with \nthe Advocate General that there is no compelling reason to read in to the notion of indi- \nvidual concern, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, a \nrequirement that an individual applicant seeking to challenge a measure must be differ- \nentiated from all others affected by it in the same way as an addressee.85 Could such \nan interpretation mean the end of the Plaumann test? \nOne advantage of a rights-based approach towards Article 230 EC is that it removes \nthe need for applicants to accommodate the restrictive criteria of paragraph 4. Under the \nreasoning of both the Advocate General and the CFI, once the applicant has established \na right, it is then the duty of the Court to protect that right. If implemented, this solution \nwould have to be accompanied by some form of admissibility test, because unchecked it \ndoes have the potential to open up the floodgates to opportunistic litigants who may view \nthe rights contained within the Charter as being absolute. One solution could be for the \nCourt to introduce a pre-hearing stage where applicants would present written pleadings \nthrough which they would establish a prima facie case. This could be similar to the proce- \ndure in the Council of Europe where the Commission conducts a review, prior to a case \nbeing heard before the European Court of Human Rights. Whatever solution is adopted, \nthis problem is not insurmountable. Even with such a development, one question still \nremains unanswered. That is whether a Community system of judicial review focused \nupon the Fundamental Charter of Rights is the most appropriate solution to not only liber- \nalise the rules on standing under paragraph 4 of Article 230 EC, but also to provide a \nremedy to applicants in a case with factual issues such as those of Greenpeace? \nIn Unidn de Pequefios Agricultores the ECJ rejected the arguments advanced by the \nAdvocate General and the CFI. First, the Court did not apply Article 47 of the Charter, \ninstead relying on the principles of Articles 6 and 13 of ECHR which it has already \nacknowledged in previous judgments.86 This judgment therefore continues the trend of \nthe post-Charter case law in which the ECJ has not formally acknowledged the exis- \ntence of the Charter, primarily due to its lack of legal status within the EU, even though \n83 Judgment of the CFI, at para 47. 84 Ibid. \n85 Ibid, para 49. 86 See n 81 above. \nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Wed, 28 Aug 2013 03:55:17 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n1010 International and Comparative Law Quarterly \nthe Advocate General or CFI may have expressly mentioned it.87 The Court remains to \nbe convinced by the arguments put forward by the Advocate Generals or the CFI, prob- \nably because it fears the floodgates opening with opportunistic litigants seeking to \nestablish rights contained within the Charter as being absolute. This is a legitimate \nconcern. In Unidn de Pequefios Agricultores the ECJ was clear that any change to para- \ngraph 4 Article 230 EC would require Treaty amendment. This judgment of the Court \nsuggests that the Charter should not be considered as a panacea. \nThe future status of the Charter has been discussed within Working Group II of the \nConvention on the Future of Europe, which has considered whether the Charter should \nbe incorporated, and if so, in what form.88 It could be argued that if future litigation \nunder Article 230 EC were to be primarily concerned with giving effect to the rights \nwithin the Charter, it is possible that this solution alone will not provide a universal \nguarantee of access to the Court. Failure to fulfil the procedural requirements contained \nwithin a directive should give rise to a cause of action which is independent of the \nenforcement of any rights within the Charter. In cases involving the failure to follow \nthe correct administrative procedure contained within a directive, the Court would still \nrequire that the applicant satisfy some criteria of locus standi, to demonstrate how the \nprocedural impropriety affected him. Therefore Article 230 EC will still be relevant. If, \nas appears likely, the legal status of the Charter were to be enhanced under any EU \nconstitutional settlement, this development alone would only be a partial improvement \nfor non-privileged applicants if Article 230 EC remains unchanged. Furthermore, if the \nCourt is correct that unilaterally it cannot rewrite paragraph 4 of Article 230 EC \nthrough teleological reasoning as it did in Chernobyl, then the matter must be left up to \nthe Treaty makers to re-draft Article 230 EC and extend locus standi to non-privileged \napplicants such as Greenpeace, who seek to enforce procedural rights within a direc- \ntive. Conversely, applicants such as Uni6n de Pequefios Agricultores could rely on \nArticle 47 of the Charter where the challenge is not based upon procedural impropri- \nety but where a general legislative measure has substantially affected the interests of \nthe members who constitute the representative group. \nVIII. CONCLUSION--RETHINKING LOCUS STANDI \nWhere then are representative actions left following Unidn de Pequefios Agricultores? \nAs the current state of case law stands Article 230 EC paragraph 4 will not permit \nproxy challenges. The Court has been clear on this. Similarly the Court will not apply \nArticle 47 of the Charter as the Advocate General or the CFI have suggested. A possi- \nble, and less controversial solution could be for the Court to focus on the need to give \neffect to procedural requirements in all cases, irrespective of the number of persons \naffected by the decision and the legislation involved. This solution omits the need for \nthe Court to make value judgments about which fundamental rights to protect and only \nrequires the Court to enforce procedural requirements which are already part of the EC \nlaw.

Though the \napplicants were ultimately unsuccessful in their challenge, the principle stated by the \nCourt is of considerable importance. The issue of due process and procedural propriety \nare crucial in any system of public law. \nIn the context of an action such as that brought by Greenpeace, the failure by the \nCommission or Spain to follow the correct procedure of the Environmental Impact \nAssessment was undoubtedly a breach under the directive. Such a failure clearly \naffected citizens of the Island generally and some inhabitants more specifically,9 but \nall Islanders were affected to a minimum level of impact. In a case such as Greenpeace, \nif the importance of procedural rights is accepted, then the there is little scope for the \nPlaumann test to operate effectively to protect those rights, because of the requirement \nof exclusivity. It seems absurd in such circumstances to recognise the existence of a \nprocedural right within a directive, but for the rules of the Court to operate in a manner \nwhich essentially denies effective protection of the substantive right. In Greenpeace, \nonce the Court denied locus standi, there was no alternative body or procedure to chal- \nlenge the Commission's decision, leaving a legal vacuum. \nThe Court did not permit such a vacuum to exist in cases such as Cofaz or Cordoniu, \nwhich involved commercial interests and where secondary legislation provided for a \ndue process to be followed. There is no reason why such a vacuum should exist when \nan organisation seeks to enforce a procedural requirement to protect a non-commercial \ninterest. Extending the reasoning of the Court in this way is both logical and desirable. \nIt would fill the gap in the EU system of public law which leaves individual citizens, \nwho share common rights, from being able to protect those rights collectively and \nobtain an effective remedy in the event of those rights being breached. \nThe conclusion to be drawn from Uni6n de Pequeiios Agricultores is that for an \napplicant in similar circumstances to Greenpeace, the opportunity to bring a challenge \nunder Article 230 EC remains ever distant. In Greenpeace itself the ECJ rejected a \nrepresentative action on the basis that the Plaumann criteria were not satisfied. The \nCourt in Union de Pequefios Agricultores confirmed this decision, but even the \nOpinion of Advocate General Jacobs offers an applicant such as Greenpeace limited \ncomfort. The Advocate General's focus on protecting fundamental rights misses the \npoint that in Greenpeace the challenge was initiated because of a failure to fulfil the \nlegal procedural requirements of the EIA Directive rather than because of the abuse of \nsome fundamental right. The lack of any review and the absence of an effective remedy \ncould be a breach of Article 47 of the Charter, but this only arises subsequently once \nthe ECJ and national court have refused to hear the case. The substantive issue there- \nfore still remains unresolved-a failure to conduct an EIA before the Commission \nfunding was paid and procedural impropriety not reviewed. \nThe right to seek judicial review under Article 230 EC should not in itself lead to \nlegislative stagnation or open the dreaded floodgates. The objective is to provide \nrecourse for individuals when their rights, whether procedural or fundamental, have \nbeen infringed. The trend within the Member States is one of adopting relaxed stand- \n90 eg, those living in close proximity to the power stations or whose livelihood was affected by \nthe projects. This question of proximity was seen as a crucial issue for the English Court in \nGreenpeace No 2 and ultimately a key factor in the Court granting locus standi to Greenpeace to \nbring the representative action.

In particular the growth of \npublic interest litigation has in many Member States proved to be an effective form of \nopposition to governments which are regularly perceived as being out of touch. \nThe crucial problem for the Court is to establish working parameters of who should \nbe given locus standi. Permitting public interest litigation in circumstances where \ncollective rights are infringed is arguably the preferred option. The advantages of this \nhave already been discussed, but the Court remains unreceptive to the idea. As the law \ncurrently stands, the Court's view in Unidn de Pequejios Agricultores that the matter \nultimately rests with the Treaty makers remains the only option to secure change, \nthough some guidance from the Court as to what it views as achievable would be \nwelcome. Modifying the Treaty to allow for targeted public interest litigation to allow \ncitizens to protect their own rights and safeguard the rights of the community in which \nthey live would be an excellent starting point for shaping the future the social and polit- \nical structure of the EU. \nAdam Cygan* \n* Lecturer in Law, Centre for European Law and Integration, University of Leicester.
