Following the collapse of state socialism in Europe \nin 1989\u20131991, many immediate approaches to environmental reconstruction assumed that \neconomic liberalisation and democratisation would alleviate problems. Since then, critics \nhave argued these proposed solutions were themselves problematic, and too closely reflected \nWestern European and North American conceptions of environmental quality and \ndemocracy. This paper summarises debates about environment and post-socialism since \n1989\u20131991. In particular, the paper examines whether an essentialistic link can be made \nbetween state socialism and environmental problems, and how far civil society \u2013 or \nenvironmentalism \u2013 may result in an improvement in perceived environmental quality. The \npaper finally considers the possibility for developing an approach to environment and post-\nsocialism that lies between crude generalisation and micro-scale studies. \n \nKEYWORDS: environment, post-socialism, neoliberalism, civil society, state socialism, \ndemocratization \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThis paper introduces a special grouping of work on the theme of environment and \npost-socialism from the Post Socialist Geographies Research Group of the Royal \nGeographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). The aim this first \npaper is to summarise recent debates concerning environment and post-socialism, and \nthen outline key questions for constructing new and locally determined forms of \nenvironmental governance. The following papers by Adam Fagin and Caedmon \nStaddon illustrate these questions by discussing individual cases of environmental \npolicy under post-socialism. \n \nIt has long been acknowledged that many official responses to post-socialism have been \ninspired more by western frameworks than by the wishes and concerns of local populations \n(e.g. Dunford, 1998; Jancar-Webster, 1998). In 1992, Michalak and Gibb (1992:342) wrote \nthat academic debates in political geography were flawed in relation to post-socialism \nbecause they were \u2018using frameworks designed to deal with the capitalist state in the context \nof a western-style parliamentary democracy\u2019. Adopting western-style methods and solutions \nto post-socialist problems \u2013 and defining these problems in terms of the west \u2013 resulted only \nin compounding the already serious challenges of post-socialism by failing to acknowledge \nthe diversity and specificity of different post-socialist societies. \n \nSuch comments may also be made in relation to environmental problems under post-\nsocialism. Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1990, much environmental attention \nwas absorbed by catastrophic images such as Chernobyl, the polluted Aral Sea, discarded \nplutonium mines, and decaying nuclear submarines. Many authors portrayed these as \nideological failures resulting directly from state socialism. In 1994 Parysk and Dutkowski \n(1994:424) wrote: \n \n \n 3 \n \n [Under the socialist state] \u2018the principle of primacy of ideology over politics, politics \nover the economy, and the economy over social problems, has left behind legacies of \nan incapable, inefficient, technologically backward and pathological economic \nsystem; an incapacitated, collectivised and cowed society lacking initiative and \ndeprived of any influence on its own fate; and an over-exploited, devastated and \ndegraded environment.\u2019 \n \nYet even then, such a direct link between state socialism and environmental degradation was \nbeing questioned. In 1991, Petr Pithart, a Czech government official, was quoted as saying:  \n \n \u2018We [in Czechoslovakia] did not get into this environmental mess only because the \nCommunists suffered excessively from a growth mentality. The West is little different \non that score. The planned economy led to some awful distortions, but it did not \ninvent unsustainable forestry, chemical agriculture, crowded cities, traffic jams, or \nindustrial smog\u2019 (quoted in Audubon, January 1991; in Rodes and Odell, 1992:62). \n \nThis paper questions the proposed link between post socialist transition and environment. The \npaper summarises the various debates about environment under post-socialism since the \ncollapse of state socialism in Europe in 1989\u20131991, and seeks to identify new, more flexible \napproaches to the subject. In particular, the paper questions whether an essentialistic link can \nbe made between post-socialism and either environmental problems, or proposed solutions to \nenvironmental problems. Yet rather than dismissing any link at all, or replacing crude \ngeneralisations with an approach that only supports micro-scale place studies, the paper also \nconsiders how far researchers can combine a generalised approach to post-socialism that also \nacknowledges local needs and concerns (see also Pickles and Smith, 1998; Pavlinek and \nPickles, 2000). \n \nThe paper is divided into three main sections. First, the paper paints a picture of approaches \nto environment under post-socialism immediately following the collapse of European state-\nsocialism. This section is based upon policy actions and academic texts of the time, and seeks \nto demonstrate the essentialistic link made between the perceived failings of socialist \ngovernment and what was then considered to be environmental degradation. Secondly, the \npaper summarises criticisms of these approaches that have emerged within the last decade. In \nparticular, this section considers the role of civil society in both before and after the collapse \nof state socialism, and the extent to which environmental activism has led to better informed, \nmore responsive environmental policy. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these \ncriticisms for environmental governance under post-socialism, and the prospects for a locally \ndetermined, yet politically effective form of policy. \n \n \nSetting the scene: market triumphalism and global environmentalism in 1990 \n \nIt was easy to be critical of socialism in the early 1990s. The revolutions in Eastern Europe in \n1989, the destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1990, and the final collapse of the Soviet Union in \n1991 came at a time of neoliberal hegemony in Europe and North America. Much of the \nWest had enjoyed years of economic growth under the pro-market leadership of Reagan, \nThatcher, and Kohl \u2013 the so-called \u2018age of market triumphalism\u2019 (Peet and Watts, 1993). \n \n \n 4 \nMeanwhile, President Reagan\u2019s rhetoric of \u2018the evil empire\u2019 in relation to the Soviet Union \nduring the Cold War added further righteousness to differences between East and West. \nWhen state socialism collapsed in Central and Eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, what \nfollowed was rightly described as the \u2018victory of the one alternative\u2019 (Jancar-Webster, 1998). \nThe western \u2018model\u2019 of market democracy became the prescribed solution to the countries \nundergoing post socialist transition, even though it was already clear there was great diversity \nand problems within this so-called model. Furthermore, the collapse of state socialism could \nbe attributed to a wide variety of causes both inside and outside Central and Eastern Europe, \nand not simply the errors of economic management. \n \nThe debate about environment under post-socialism also reflected such conflicts between \nEast and West. The undoubted environmental catastrophes of the Soviet Union at Chernobyl, \nthe Aral Sea, and its many plutonium mines and major industrial zones were seen as both \nexamples of uncaring state-socialist bureaucracy, yet also were redolent of Cold War \napocalyptic rhetoric (Medvedev, 1992; Feshbach, 1995). Moreover, the governments of \nCentral and Eastern Europe approached environmental issues from the viewpoint of security  \nor as threats to the state, and thus did not debate these with private citizens (Heinisch, 1992). \n \nUnder the centrally planned economies of state socialism, achieving set-increases in \nproduction was the key way to measure economic progress and was considered more \nimportant than \u2018temporary\u2019 negative environmental impacts (Waller and Millard, 1992). \nAgainst state-socialism\u2019s \u2018fixation on economic development above everything else\u2019 \n(Jancar-Webster, 1998:77), environmental concerns were of little immediate value, as \nthe costs of degradation could be hidden or denied officially, postponed to a later 5 \nyears plan, while leaving immediate achievements to be claimed as politically necessary \nachievements. With no profits to be made from environmental degradation by \nindividual industrialists, it was commonly argued that, in the interest of all society, \n\u2018socialism could afford to be a little bit dirtier\u2019 (Boehmer-Christiansen, 1998:72). \nIndeed, under a system where all resources were placed in public ownership, pollution \ncould not be defined in terms of the private sector offloading costs onto the public \nsector as it has been defined in capitalist societies (Goldman, 1992). While clearly some \nconcern about pollution did lead to the voicing of discontent by some social groups, the \namount of possible debate allowed in the public domain was of course radically less \nthan in western Europe or North America. \n \nAs a result of such concerns, academic approaches within Europe and North America to the \nenvironmental problems of socialist states in the early 1990s were generally influenced by \ngeneral critiques of Marxism-Leninism as an economic and political system vis-\u00e0-vis the \nseeming superiority of the western market system. Two key themes in criticisms can be \nidentified: an approach focusing on economic management and the internalisation of \nenvironmental costs; and the focus on the role of social activism and civil society in creating \nan equitable and effective environmental policy. \n \nUnder economic approaches, the key errors lay in the inefficiencies of the state as a body to \nconduct rational and non-wasteful allocation of resources (Baker and Jehlicka, 1998). This \nprinciple was adopted by critiques from the contemporaneously growing discipline of \nenvironmental economics in the early 1990s (Osaghae, 1994; Payne, 1995). Pollution (or \nresource depletion) was approached as an economic externality reflecting the failure of \n \n \n 5 \ncurrent pricing systems, or the negative impacts of subsidies afforded to local producers or \nstate bureaucrats (DeBardeleben, 1985; Baker and Jehlicka, 1998). Increasing market forces, \nand simultaneously decreasing the ineffective state mechanisms and subsidies that interfered \nwith market forces, were therefore proposed as ways to use resources more efficiently, and \nreduce pollution. Effectively, the underlying notion was that effective allocation of resources \nper se would result in environmental benefits. Drawing on Bulgarian experience, for instance, \nPeychev (1992:13) wrote that \u2018legislative and institutional transition from a centralised and \ncontrolled economy to [a] market economy\u2019 was the first necessary change required in order \nto tackle \u2018the severely damaged environment inherited from the centrally controlled \neconomy\u2019.  \n \nUnder the political debates, critics focused on the suppression of environmental activism and \ncivil society in general as a cause of ineffective environmental policy. In particular, the \ncriticism of state socialism for suppressing environmental activism came at a time when \npublic activism in the West on issues of environment were becoming more strident, and also \nincreasingly focused on \u2018global\u2019 environmental impacts. As Welsh and Tickle (1998:1) \nnoted, \u2018the 1989 revolutions coincided with a marked \u201cglobal turn\u201d in environmental \npolitics\u2019. Initially, socialist governments resisted international environmental pressure, yet \nunder perestroika and glasnost there was a growing willingness to co-operate on international \nenvironmental matters (Goldman, 1992, 1993; Baker and Jehlicka, 1998). In 1989, for \nexample, 1989 CSCE environmental conference was held in Sofia (Nikitina, 1992; Waller \nand Millard, 1992). Local environmental groups within socialist countries also grew in \nnumber. Yet the influence of such groups on environmental policy has been strongly \ncontested, as discussed the following section. \n \nEnvironmental problems under post-socialism in 1990 were therefore approached largely \namong western analysts and activists as a function of state socialist economics, and the \npolitical suppression of environmentalism as a regulating force. Yet while it is important to \nacknowledge the influence of state socialism on environmental problems, many \nenvironmental hazards in the East were still intricately combined with interactions with the \nWest. During the latter half of the 1980s, for example, West Germany paid hard currency to \nEast Germany to import industrial waste for treatment or storage in disused mines. Such \ntreatment would have been costly or politically unpopular in West Germany. Yet West \nGerman politicians still continued to attack East Germany for allowing transboundary \npollutants such as acid rain and discharges in rivers (Hillenbrand, 1996). \n \nThe contradiction reflected the generally poorly developed state of international \nenvironmental negotiation at the time. The problems of international pollution had been \nacknowledged in the 1984 Munich Conference on Transboundary Air Pollution, at which \nWestern German environmental groups campaigned widely against the perceived pollution \n\u2018across the border\u2019 (Kabala, 1993). Yet the first bilateral environmental agreement between \nEast and West Germany was only signed in 1987, and then only acknowledged the shared \nnature of many environmental problems in 1990. The debate about state socialism, and its \nrelationship with environment in the early 1990s was therefore also restricted by the general \nevolution of international environmental debate at the time, and the wide disparity between \nthe concerns of the public, the campaigns of environmental activists, and the ability of \ngovernments to implement policies quickly through effective mechanisms or international \nagreement (Young, 1997). \n \n \n 6 \n \n \nAcknowledging complexity: post-socialism and environment in 2000 \n \nIf debates about post-socialism in 1990 were characterised by criticisms of socialist economy \nand political management, then discussions since 1990 have shifted to acknowledging the \nerrors within the proposed solutions. Four key themes have been identified in relation to \nconventional approaches to post-socialist transition. Firstly, the inherent focus of proposed \nsolutions on economic liberalisation and democratisation have been criticised for overlooking \nwhat these terms might mean, and how they may be implemented in post-socialist societies \nand economies (Baker and Jehlicka, 1998; Frankland and Cox, 1995). Secondly, post-\nsocialist countries have been acknowledged to be highly varied and complex, with specific \npaths of transition emerging as a reflection of place specificity (Herrschel, 1999; Dostal, \n1998). Thirdly, the term \u2018transition\u2019 as commonly used to describe post-socialism  (Clague, \n1992) has been criticised for implying a teleological journey from state socialism to \ndemocratic capitalism without acknowledging alternative pathways, or the problems of \ndemocratic capitalism itself. \u2212 Indeed, the terms \u2018East\u2019 and \u2018West\u2019 have also been criticised \nfor suggesting a uniformity and predictability between capitalist and post-socialist countries \nthat may never have existed. Such words also overlook the obvious differences relating to \nnon-European post-socialist states (Hann, 1992; Weigle and Butterfield, 1992; Offe, 1994; \nPickvance, 2000). A fourth concern \u2013 discussed later in this paper \u2013 is the changed \nunderstanding of environment and environmental change, and the role of social activism in \ncommunicating and establishing particular concerns above others. \n \nThere have been several criticisms of economic liberalisation as a form of \nenvironmental reform. Based on experience to date, it has been clear that the more \nefficient allocation of resources resulting from freer markets has not been reached, or \nthat market distortions and inequities still exist (Eckersley, 1992; Smith, 1996; Baker \nand Jehlicka, 1998). In eastern Germany, for example, foreign investment has not \nresulted in a more socially equitable form of development, but instead the purchase and \nrationalisation of the more attractive investment opportunities by outsiders. The result \nhas been a spatially very selective investment and resulting distribution of benefits to \nsociety. In other countries, inflation, rapid economic decline, and a shortage of basic \ngoods have also affected economic recovery. As Fforde and de Vylder (1996:312) \nwrote in relation to Vietnam,  \n \u2018whereas inflation, eroding central authority, and even corruption may have been \n\u2018creatively destructive\u2019 during the transitional phase, the same phenomena are today \nmerely destructive.\u2019 \nSuch problems have furthered the questioning of the so-called \u2018Washington Consensus\u2019 of \nthe early 1990s, which was adopted by international institutions such as the World Bank and \nInternational Monetary Foundation for managing national economic strategies through \nneoliberal principles of financial liberalisation (Welsh, 1994). Instead, theorists are quicker to \nacknowledge the role of the state in facilitating investment and maintaining regulation, rather \nthan in a simple distinction between state and market alone (van Brabant, 1992; Tickle and \nWelsh, 1998). Baker and Jehlicka (1998: 25) point strongly to the failure by the ECE \ncountries to adopt a more pro-active stance in transition, especially regarding environmental \n \n \n 7 \nissues: \n \n\u2018This [tackling of environmental issues] has meant a failure on behalf of ECE \ncountries to realise a more far-reaching and ultimately more rewarding approach \ntowards the management of transition\u2026.\u2019 \n \nConcerning democratisation, the formation and influence of civil society has also been \nproblematised for failing to produce an effective greater inclusivity of society in the political \nprocess (e.g. Rau, 1991; Kornai, 1992). Research of post-socialist civil society in general has \nindicated that, despite the rise of social movements and new political organisations under \npost-socialism, pre-existing \u00e9lites or state members continue to be powerful in politics despite \nthe collapse of the socialist state per se (Welsh, 1994; Lewis, 1997). Furthermore, the \nemergence of new political voices has not necessarily implied an increased representation for \npreviously marginalised groups such as some women, ethnic minorities, or transient workers \n(Sperling, 1999). As a result, critics have argued that the long hoped-for emergence of social \ncapital under post-socialism has to be countered by the persistence of so-called \u2018political \ncapital\u2019, or the continued possession of power by established \u00e9lites. As an example, the \nemergence of a new business class from within the state or Communist Party in Russia has \nbeen described as a new \u2018Nomenklatura capitalism\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018capitalists without capitalism\u2019 \u2013 \nbecause the new business class has political capital without inducing economic development, \nand also may engage in corrupt business activities or selfish \u2018property grabs\u2019 (Baker and \nJehlicka, 1998: 5). However, in Eastern and Central Europe, the dependency of economic \ngrowth on a managerial class outside the existing state has been claimed to produce a more \ndynamic and equitable \u2018capitalism without capitalists\u2019 (Eyal et al, 1997). \n \nSuch difficulties in achieving effective democratisation, and the persistence of old \n\u00e9lites, have affected the ways in which environmentalists may influence policy.  In an \nanalysis of the Czech Republic, Slocock (1996) described four factors that led to the \ncontinued importance of the central state in environmental policy. Firstly, pressure-\ngroup politics are poorly developed, and hence industrial lobbies have been unable to \noppose new environmental legislation. Secondly, compact environmental-policy \nnetworks within government have enabled legislators to develop and enforce new \nguidelines quickly. Thirdly, the dynamics of competition within coalition governments \nhas resulted in environmental policy being made a priority. Fourthly, international \npressure has made it necessary for the Czech state to enforce environmental protection \nin order to gain international legitimacy. As a result, the Czech Republic has often been \nused as an example of, in western eyes, successful integration of local \nenvironmentalism, state response, and international regulation (also see following paper \nby Adam Fagin).  \n \nHowever, elsewhere in Europe, the relationship of environmental activism to other forms of \nsocial unrest have been more complicated, with signs of  proliferation and marginalization,  \nand occasionally tensions emerging between environmentalism and other political themes, \nsuch as nationalism, when it comes to cooperation for poilitcal expediency (Waller and \nMillard, 1992; Jancar-Webster, 1998). In the Romanian city of Giurgiu in the 1980s, for \nexample, environmentalism was associated with nationalism when local complaints about \nsulphur emissions from factories in the neighbouring Bulgarian town of Ruse gained extra \npolitical impetus because it was linked to criticism of Bulgaria (Botcheva, 1998). In this case, \n \n \n 8 \nnationalism was an impetus to environmental objectives, thus forming an effective discourse \ncoalition of different political interests, and consequent improvement in the political potency \nof both political sentiments (Hajer, 1995). However, in Slovakia in the early 1990s, \nnationalism proved a source of dissent in environmental movements, thus significantly \nweakening the initial aims of the environmentalists (see also Podoba, 1998; Snajdr, 1998; \nPavlinek and Pickles, 2000:186-189). \n \nPerhaps most importantly, environmentalism often arose under state socialism because \nit was the only form of public protest allowed, and citizens also used it to express the \nsuppression of public debate and personal values under socialism (Yanitsky, 1991, \n1996; Boehmer Christiansen, 1998). However, this did not lead to an immediate decline \nin environmental objectives in political debate after the collapse of socialism. In \nCzechoslovakia, for example, the government placed environmental concerns as a high \npriority in its new agenda. Furthermore, evidence elsewhere in Central and Eastern \nEurope indicates that local environmentalism both grew and diversified greatly after \n1990 (Pavlinek and Pickles, 2000). Yet at the same time, the changes in policy resulting \nfrom the initial environmental euphoria became less uniform and established, and its \neffects more diversified and indirect. Many environmental activists \u2013 successful in \nenvironmental activism under socialism \u2013 quickly joined mainstream politics, leaving \nbehind politically less versatile groupings (Waller and Millard, 1992). Added to this, \nmuch impetus for environmentalism changed from state-dominated ventures to \nindependent and local campaigns. This led inevitably to a fragmentation of initiatives \nand policies, weakening their perceived relevance at national level with populations \nincreasingly focused on pursuing a western lifestyle (Jancar-Webster, 1998). \n \nBut importantly too, the political context of environmentalism became far more complex, and \nlinked to a number of campaigns and objectives at local, national and international levels. In \nsome locations, the environmental improvement post-socialism became part of the \nauthorities\u2019 attempt to encourage more investment and enhance particular regions\u2019 \nreputations. In northern Bohemia, for example, the government of the Czech Republic now \nmarket the environmental renovation of old coal mining areas as a key factor in economic \nrecovery (Herrschel, 2001). But while there are examples of governments actively enacting \nenvironmental improvement, some critics have also claimed that the emerging form of \nenvironmentalism in Central and Eastern Europe is also influenced by East\u2013West advocacy \ncoalitions that may not effectively represent local views and concerns inside post-Socialist \ncountries. In Germany, for example, the western Green party absorbed the eastern German \nopposition movement B\u00fcndnis 90 (Association 90) on the assumption that each would share \nviews about environment and would jointly represent a broader power base. Former activists \nunder socialism are now part of a party machinery embedded in western German politics and \nparticipate in western German elections (such as the in the Land of North-Rhine Westphalia \non 14 May 2000 \u2013 K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger, 15 May 2000). They are thus no longer acting as \nrepresentatives of eastern German grassroots civil society. In addition, the prospect of EU \nmembership, as well as \u2018green conditionality\u2019 attached to financial loans by international \nagencies, such as the EU through its Phare programme, and the World Bank, have enhanced a \nwestern environmental agenda. As Jancar-Webster (1998: 75) observed: \n \n \u2018Aid to the ECE was the first in the world to be required to have an environmental  \n component\u2019. \n \n \n 9 \n \nYet what is at stake here is not just the influence of different actors upon the achievement of \nenvironmental reconstruction, but also the political process by which environmental problems \nare constructed. The experience of environmentalism in North America and Western Europe \nsince the 1960s has been typified as a \u2018new\u2019 social movement characteristic of post-industrial \nor post-materialist societies (e.g. Welsh and Tickle, 1998:20). In Central and Eastern Europe, \nhowever, such societal conditions for social movement formation are different, and \ncomplicated by the establishment of environmentalism as a pre-existing political force in the \ncapitalist west. Waller and Millard (1992:171) wrote: \n\u2018Eastern Europe as yet provides neither the social base nor the social conditions for the \n\u201cpost-materialist\u201d society\u2019. \n \nThis difference between environmentalism as a political force in different societies has also \nbeen noted in relation to non-European undergoing market reform under socialism or post-\nsocialism. Indeed, the combination of rapid industrial growth (as in China and Vietnam), yet \nwithout the overt collapse of socialist states or communist parties has illustrated up a variety \nof key differences between the Asian and European experiences of post-socialism. In China, \nfor example, the weakening of the state has not necessarily implied a strengthening of society \nper se but the growth in importance of local state institutions in alliance with local \nentrepreneurs (Wank, 1995; White, et al 1996). As such, these alliances present a greater link \nbetween economic and social forms of civil society in favour of local control over resources \nand industrialisation, rather than as a critique of state and industry alone (Urry, 1981). Indeed, \nthe emphasis of environmentalism in Western Europe and North America as a \u2018new\u2019 social \nmovement, supposedly characteristic of post-industrial society, and seeking a remedy to then \ninstrumental reason of an industrial technocratic society, may not easily be transferred to \ncountries currently undergoing industrialisation as well as transition (Yanitssky, 1993). \nIndeed, some researchers have suggested that post socialist transition (or increasing economic \nliberalisation) in developing countries needs to be seen as the increasing link of local \nindustrialists and local state structures, as critics of central state, rather than the abolition of \nstate altogether or the separation of supposed local interests from the interests of \nentrepreneurs. Wank (1995:75) wrote:  \n  \n\u2018it is the power of the local bureaucracy [in China] that is most enhanced by the \nemergence of private capitalist business. Through discretionary control over \nregulatory levers, officials can extract an income from private enterprises thereby \nreducing their financial dependence on the central state. The emergence of \n\u2018autonomy\u2019 in the overall political configuration, therefore, is less the growing \nautonomy of society vis-a-vis the state, but rather the heightened autonomy of locales \ncomprised of alliances between local state and society actors vis-a-vis the central \nstate.\u2019 \n \nAnd Adger (2000:755) noted that \n \n\u2018the continued dominance of state institutions in numerous aspects of resource \nallocation is a key determinant of collective security and vulnerability in Vietnam\u2026 \nthe political recasting of some of the organs of administrative power does not \nnecessarily lead to greater local participation and collective empowerment\u2019. \n \n \n \n 10 \nApproaches to post socialist reconstruction that readily define economic liberalisation and \ndemocratisation in the form of \u2018civil society\u2019 may therefore avoid the great complexity \ncontained within these terms, and also fail to acknowledge the ways they may also reflect \nWestern European or North American experience and values. In environmental terms this \nmay be particularly experienced in relation to the construction of environmentalism under \npost-industrial societies in North America and Western Europe, rather than the experience of \nenvironment and resources in transitional or developing countries. In effect, this may mean \nthat local environmental concerns in developing and transitional countries may focus more on \nthe desire to participate equitably in industrialisation and resource exploitation, than in \nadopting the environmental values and objectives of Western environmentalists (Forsyth, \n1997). \n \nThe different construction of environmental objectives and quality between different \nsocieties illustrates a wider set of changes that have occurred in debates about \nenvironment in general since the early 1990s. For example, \u2018non-equilibrium\u2019 forms of \necosystem analysis are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to previous \nexplanations that tended to portray environment in natural balance (e.g. Botkin, 1990). \nSimilarly, other researchers have argued for local participation and framing in \nenvironmental scientific explanation in order to gain locally relevant management tools \nand acceptance of proposed policies (Cohen et al, 1998). These new approaches to \nenvironmental understanding have implications for the role of civil society in the \ndefinition and communication of environmental problems. The encouragement of \nadvocacy coalitions between East and West, or the belief that adherence to international \nenvironmental codes may result in effective environmental policy (as proposed by \nHaas, 1994; Wapner, 1995), overlook the extent to which such alliances or codes may \nnot reflect local environmental needs and concerns. It is clear that many initial \nassumptions about environmental degradation under post-socialism were based upon \npre-existing notions of environment from western societies rather than local debates \n(see following paper by Caedmon Staddon). \n \nSuch different constructions of environmental objectives are illustrated in some of the most \ncurrently negotiated aspects of environmental policy in post socialist countries. Under the \nKyoto Protocol of 1997, for example, the establishment of an emissions trading system as one \nway to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions was criticised by using estimates of \nindustrial emissions dating from 1990. According to one estimate, Russia and the Ukraine are \ncurrently emitting at 30 percent below 1990 levels as a result of industrial decline (Grubb et \nal, 1999:216). Using 1990 levels may therefore result in no overall reduction in the emission \nof greenhouse gases as these post-socialist countries may be able to sell permits for \nreductions in emissions that would have occurred anyway (the so-called \u2018hot air\u2019 problem). \nSimilarly, under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), also created by the Kyoto \nProtocol, industrialised countries with targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Annex I \ncountries) may do so partly by investing in climate-friendly activities in non-Annex I (usually \ndeveloping) countries. Yet, to date, the CDM only evaluates projects according to their \nimpact on greenhouse gas concentrations, and therefore differing projects such as forest \nplantations or renewable energy investment are seen equally in the eyes of the Kyoto Protocol \nif they impact equally on greenhouse gases, regardless of how each strategy may impact on \nlocal development or local environmental concerns (Forsyth, 1999). A similar uniform \napproach is that central European countries awaiting accession into the EU will have to \n \n \n 11 \ncomply with general EU-defined environmental standards with which they will have had no \nability to influence (Altmann, 1997). \n \nThe implications of these debates are that extending preconceived ideas about environmental \nquality and practice to post socialist countries may in fact impose values and solutions upon \nsocieties that may not agree with them. Yet while it is important to acknowledge potential \nclashes of values between (and within) post-socialist societies and outside experts and \nactivists, implementing any environmental policy also depends on building an effective, and \ninclusive, political infrastructure. In many post-socialist countries official data on \nenvironmental performance are unreliable (Altshuler et al, 1992:204). And the evolution of \nlocal governance in the wake of state socialism is, of course, difficult, and requires further \nsteps. \n \n \nConstructing a new understanding of environment under post-socialism  \n \nThis paper has argued for a new understanding of environment under post-socialism, one \ndecade on from the dramatic fall of the Iron Curtain. The years immediately following the \ncollapse of state socialism in Eastern and Central Europe were dominated by simplistic and \ngeneralising interpolations from western experience labelled as the leading, \u2018victorious\u2019 \nsocietal-economic paradigm. Few attempts were have been made to appreciate different, and \nmore local, approaches to \u2018environment\u2019 in the former socialist societies. \n \nYet when the over-simplicity of initial approaches became evident in the wake of a better \nunderstanding of the nature and diversity of post-socialist change and societal-economic \nprocesses, the academic debate responded by emphasising diversity, individuality and small-\nscale geography in post-socialist analyses. There are thus signs that two diametrically \nopposed understandings are emerging of environment under post-socialism. We argue that \nthese contrasting approaches should not be seen as two competing, mutually exclusive and \ncontradictory understandings, but rather more like the endpoints of a scale between which to \nposition the starting point for \u2018appropriate\u2019 research of the complex nature of environment \nunder post-socialism. At one end of the scale is a clear emphasis on the general contrast \nbetween western and post-socialist countries and their relationship to \u2018environment\u2019. At the \nother end is a distinct focus on the individual differences that emerged between these \ncountries in response to specific historic-political, institutional and cultural factors. Key \nwithin this scales is the appreciation that the two key elements commonly used to define state \nsocialism \u2013 central economic planning and suppression of civil society \u2013 are themselves \nperceived from societies where \u2018free markets\u2019 and \u2018democratisation\u2019 have their own \ncontextualisation, and that it is dangerous to project these concepts uncritically to post-\nsocialist countries as potential solutions to specific problems. \n \nConstructing a new understanding of environment under post-socialism, we argue, lies thus in \nreassessing the original reasoning that led to the initial assumptions of post-socialist \ndevelopment and, subsequently, uniform approaches to its explanation and interpretation, \nwhile simultaneously addressing specific variations in representing, and responding to, \nenvironmental issues in post-socialist countries. This includes the role of the environmental \nmovement as perceived instigator of the overthrow of the state-socialist regimes and the  \nsimplistic portrayal of environmental degradation as endemic of state-socialism to a degree \n \n \n 12 \nwhere popular fear of an environmental catastrophe was greater than that of oppressive state \npower.  \n \nFurthermore, the generalised and often na\u00efve inference of western experiences with \nenvironmental issues and movements to post-socialist conditions included assumptions about \nthe similarity in aims and political affiliations of those groups that acquired a particular \ninterest in environmental issues in western and east-central Europe. It is important to note \nthere were, however, distinct differences. The environmental movement in the \u2018West\u2019 grew \nstrength and political acceptance from the new social movements of the 1960s, and \nchallenged the established market democracies from an \u2018alternative\u2019, intellectual and often \nneo-Marxist point of view (despite the fact many groups existed long before this period). The \nmovements under state socialism had a shorter tradition, and came from a rejection of  \n\u2018actually existing\u2019 Marxism-Leninism. They thus had, especially in the early 1990s, little love \nlost for left-leaning sentiments (McKay, 2000). Environmental concerns at the end of state-\nsocialism were the rallying point to challenge and overthrow Marxism-Leninism, not to \nfollow it in a new, \u2018sanitised\u2019 and \u2018intellectualised\u2019 format. It is this difference which so \neasily can be ignored and overseen when, usually from a western perspective, simply looking \nat the seemingly obvious common denominator of \u2018environmental concern\u2019. Yet at the same \ntime, it is important to respond to the distinct differences under which these groups emerged \nand established their legitimacy as popular challengers to the socialist state system. Again, \nthe socialist experience provided the common root, while different democratic \u2018growth\u2019 \nsprang from it.  \n \nThe simplistic conclusion was derived from the very understanding of \u2018post-socialism\u2019 as \nsynonym for \u2018new market liberalism\u2019, towards which the \u2018transition\u2019 process would lead by \ndefault, including dealings with \u2018environment\u2019. In reality, however, environmental \nmovements pursued quite different political affiliations, usually out of political expediency to \nsecure their viability, than their western (notional) counterparts. Tying up with nationalist \ngroups, as in Slovenia, for instance, would seem completely beyond the ideologically \ntolerable in western environmentalist circles. This reflects the quite different understanding of \n\u2018environment\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis liberal capitalism in the \u2018West\u2019, in contrast to a more co-opted, \n\u2018integral part\u2019 of market processes as developing under post-socialism. Thus, in the western \nunderstanding, \u2018environment\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019 policies are usually an ideological pair, as are \u2018right\u2019 \nand \u2018free market\u2019. Under post-socialism, these paradigmatic pairings are less obvious and \nsubject to much greater variation. \u2018Environment\u2019 is much less clearly associated with a \nparticular political leaning, nor is there a (dogmatic) confrontational stance towards \u2018market\u2019. \nInstead, \u2018environment\u2019 is currently little more than a separate niche within the dominant \nparadigm of the market economy, with left-wing policy agendas in most post-socialist \ncountries very suspect.  \n \nThe presumed uniformity inevitably ignored the fundamental effect of \u2018post-socialism\u2019 on the \nsocietal underpinnings in terms of experiences, values and priorities of the former state-\nsocialist societies in comparison to those of  the \u2018West\u2019 and the diverse and individual \nvariations between post-socialist countries and even regions and localities. It is this dual \nquality of \u2018differential commonality\u2019 of post-socialist development which refers to the \ncontested and constructed understandings of the nature of environment and environmental \nproblems under post-socialism. It is only now, after a decade of experience and learning, that \nthis complexity is becoming clearer and is making way into the political and academic debate \n \n \n 13 \nand a more sensitive and appropriate analysis of post-socialist environmentalism. The issue \nnow, however, is not to \u2018throw the baby out with the bathwater\u2019 and focus entirely on \ndifference and individuality. Post-socialism as such is a very unique societal condition which \nneeds to be acknowledged in its common characteristics and implications for future \ndevelopment in the relevant countries. \n \nAchieving a new understanding of environment under post-socialism thus depends most \ncrucially on the construction of local capacity for political debate and self-determination. In \nthis sense, creating \u2018environmental capacity\u2019 implies creating the space for local \ndetermination of environmental objectives rather than simply equipping localities with \ntechnical expertise to implement objectives identified elsewhere. Such local capacity is \nillustrated in the following papers. Adam Fagin discusses the inclusivity of public \nenvironmental debate in the Czech Republic as a definition of capacity for reform. Caedmon \nStaddon discusses the integration of historic forest management practices into new strategies \nfor forest products in Bulgaria. \n \nYet the construction of local environmental democracy is still far from complete, made \ndifficult by the immediate challenges of day-to-day life under post-socialism. There is a \ncontinued role for the state (and international advocates, such as the EU) in providing space \nfor such discussion and maintaining scope for emancipating democratic adoption of these \nissues. Any state-political arrangement would thus have to incorporate the outcomes of \nrequired continued learning processes and thus growing assertiveness of democratic will. \nEnvironmental objectives will therefore need to be increasingly defined \u2018from within\u2019 rather \nthan from outside post-socialist societies. \n \nThese changes have to be acknowledged by analytical approaches to the role of \n\u2018environment\u2019 under post-socialism. The result is a degree of diversity that is unlikely to be \nencapsulated in a single explanatory framework, but will encourage a variety of  \ninterpretations. It is important, however, that these acknowledge their common grounding in \nthe particular characteristics of post-socialism as an experiential framework of the \ndevelopment in formerly socialist countries. Otherwise, the result may be an atomizaton of \narguments, obscuring the commonality of post-socialist experiences, while stressing minutiae \nin difference and specificity. While this paper has acknowledged the deconstruction of \nenvironmental discourse and the need for discursive democracy, we also wish to avoid the \nmore fissiparist effects of \u2018the syndrome of post-modernism\u2019 observed in academic debate \nand analysis of western societies (Padgett 1999:18). Post-socialist characteristics, by contrast, \nmay offer some common direction. \n  \nThe argument here is that after the collapse of state-socialism a more locally nuanced, yet \ndistinctly \u2018post-socialist\u2019 environmentalism needs to be established, involving greater scope \nfor the local determination of environmental and developmental objectives in response to the \nparticular place-specific experiences, expertise and ambitions as shaped under post-socialism. \nThis may be more akin to the socially responsible capitalism or \u2018Third Way\u2019 public\u2013private \nsynergies attempted in varying forms by Blair, Clinton and Schr\u00f6der. We argue that such a \nlocally nuanced form of environmental management is crucial to constructing a new \nunderstanding of environment under the common and still very present experience of  post-\nsocialism. The individuality within post-socialist commonality needs to be accepted by \nexisting dominant \u2018western\u2019 theoretical explanations and paradigms. Constructing a new \n \n \n 14 \nunderstanding of environment under post-socialism does not always mean rejecting the \nconcepts and values of other countries and societies. But it does imply amending our thoughts \nand proposals to acknowledge the differences between our experience and the needs of post-\nsocialist countries, and also allowing the ability for local determination in both identifying \nproblems and in receiving proposed solutions. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe papers included in the edition were partly selected from the conference: \u2018The \nenvironment: risks and opportunities\u2019, held at Oxford University in June 1999, and the \ncollection forms one of the first outputs from the Post Socialist Geography Research Group \nof the Institute of  the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). \nThe authors would like to thank two anonymous referees for their helpful advice, and Craig \nYoung for his generous assistance in compiling this set of  papers. \n \n  \n \nReferences \n \nAdger, W.
