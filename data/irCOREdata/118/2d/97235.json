For this purpose, mathematical models are routinely\ndeveloped based on experimental observations, which also allow the prediction of the system\nbehaviour under different experimental conditions. Often, however, the same experimental data\ncan be represented by several competing network models.\nResults: In this paper, we developed a novel mathematical model\/experiment design cycle to help\ndetermine the probable network connectivity by iteratively invalidating models corresponding to\ncompeting signalling pathways. To do this, we systematically design experiments in silico that\ndiscriminate best between models of the competing signalling pathways. The method determines\nthe inputs and parameter perturbations that will differentiate best between model outputs,\ncorresponding to what can be measured\/observed experimentally. We applied our method to the\nunknown connectivities in the chemotaxis pathway of the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We\nfirst developed several models of R. sphaeroides chemotaxis corresponding to different signalling\nnetworks, all of which are biologically plausible. Parameters in these models were fitted so that they\nall represented wild type data equally well. The models were then compared to current mutant\ndata and some were invalidated. To discriminate between the remaining models we used ideas from\ncontrol systems theory to determine efficiently in silico an input profile that would result in the\nbiggest difference in model outputs. However, when we applied this input to the models, we found\nit to be insufficient for discrimination in silico. Thus, to achieve better discrimination, we\ndetermined the best change in initial conditions (total protein concentrations) as well as the best\nchange in the input profile. The designed experiments were then performed on live cells and the\nresulting data used to invalidate all but one of the remaining candidate models.\nPage 1 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBioMed Central\nOpen Access\nConclusion: We successfully applied our method to chemotaxis in R. sphaeroides and the results\nfrom the experiments designed using this methodology allowed us to invalidate all but one of the\nproposed network models. The methodology we present is general and can be applied to a range of\nother biological networks.\nBackground\nUnderstanding the connectivity of signalling pathways\nwithin organisms has always been an important chal-\nlenge in biological research. One approach to address\nthis is to study individual parts in vitro and look at\nprotein localisation, homologies and co-expression in\norder to elucidate signalling pathway connectivity.\nAnother approach is to use genetics and mutants to\nattempt to work out the pathway connectivity in vivo.\nMore recently, systems biology approaches have used\nquantitative measurements to develop mathematical\nmodels that can be used for understanding the properties\nof biological signalling pathways and their connectivity\n[1-3]. These models are usually a result of cyclic\nmathematical model\/experiment design iterations,\nwhich aim to yield maximum information about the\nsystem under study [4,5]. It is well known, however, that\nmodels of comparable complexity corresponding to\ndifferent pathway connectivities may fit experimental\ndata equally well, leaving the researcher with the\ndilemma of which model is correct [6]. The question\nof which model is correct is actually impossible to\nanswer as model validation is a misnomer. The related\nquestion of which models are invalid can be answered if\nappropriate data are available, i.e. the inability of a\nmodel to reproduce a data set renders it invalid. Applied\nin this way, model invalidation can be used to reduce the\nnumber of possible models [7], hence narrowing down\nthe number of possible network connectivities.\nPrevious work in model invalidation emphasised the\nimportance of using time-varying inputs to the system\nunder study. One method of invalidation is to apply a\ndynamical input and try to maximise the difference in\nthe phase shift of two competing deterministic models\n[8]. The disadvantage of this approach is that phase-shift\nis usually difficult to quantify, especially with noisy data.\nAnother approach is presented in [9], where the authors\ndevelop a dynamic model-based controller and an input\nprofile that drives the system output along a prescribed\ntarget trajectory. However, this approach requires the\nimplementation of a controller in the laboratory which\nmay prove difficult. Other approaches for model\ninvalidation are presented in [5,10,11], and the refer-\nences therein. These lack-of-fit methods are used to\ninvalidate models in a statistical manner, but there can\nbe problems with this approach as it relies on large data\nsets and focuses on obtaining reliable parameter\nestimates rather than network connectivities. There is\nalso the issue that a wide range of model parameters\ncould give a very similar model output and these\nmethods would have difficulty coping with this.\nIn this paper we present a new method for developing\nmathematical models of biological signalling networks,\naiming to understand biological network structure.\nGiven a set of experimental data, models corresponding\nto competing network connectivies are first constructed,\nall of which can explain wild type data equally well.\nThen, experiments which maximally discriminate\nbetween models corresponding to different networks\nare designed systematically. These experimental results\nare used to invalidate models of these networks,\nresulting in a cyclic process which aims to produce a\nmathematical model corresponding to a signalling\npathway structure which explains all available wild\ntype and mutant experimental data. Our method is\napplicable to biological pathways for which it is possible\nto experimentally modify the input profile and measure\nthe output simultaneously. One such system is the\nchemotaxis signalling pathway, for which tethered cell\nexperiments can be performed in a flow cell and used to\nmeasure the response of the system to dynamic ligand\nconcentration profiles.\nChemotaxis is the biasing of movement towards regions\nof higher concentrations of beneficial or lower concen-\ntrations of toxic chemicals by altering the frequency of\nflagella switching [12]. The signalling pathway within\nE. coli is well understood and is a simple circuit with\none feedback loop [13]. The receptor in the system is a\nMethyl-accepting Chemotaxis Protein (MCP) that senses\nligands outside the cell. Associated with the MCP is the\nhistidine protein kinase called CheA. Binding of certain\nligands to MCP decreases the auto-phosphorylation rate\nof CheA. CheA can transfer phosphoryl groups to two\npossible response regulators, CheY and CheB. CheY-P\ninteracts with motor binding sites of the multiple E. coli\nflagella motors causing a change in direction. The\nreceptors are constantly methylated by the action of a\nmethyltransferase CheR, while CheB-P acts as a methy-\nlesterase to demethylate the receptor, making it less\nresponsive to ligand binding. This creates a feedback\nloop, allowing for adaptation. Adaptation allows E. coli\nto react to changes of the concentration gradient of\nBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:105 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/3\/105\nPage 2 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nligands and not to changes in concentrations per se.\nFinally, CheZ acts to dephosphorylate CheY and to\nterminate the signal.\nChemotaxis pathways in other species are less well\ncharacterised and often contain multiple homologues of\nthe E. coli system and sometimes proteins not found in\nthe E. coli signalling pathway, for example, CheD [13].\nChemotaxis pathways in other species may also have a\ndifferent connectivity - for example in S. meliloti, only\none of the two CheY homologues interacts with the\nmotor, with the other CheY acting as a phosphate sink\n[13,14]. Another good example is the chemotaxis path-\nway in R. sphaeroides. This bacterium has three chemo-\ntaxis operons, two of which are expressed under normal\nlaboratory conditions. Proteins expressed from these\noperons have previously been shown to localise to\ndiscrete signalling clusters, one at the poles of the cell,\nsimilar to E. coli, and one in the cytoplasm [15]. This\nlocalisation is thought to prevent cross talk between the\ntwo clusters, allowing them to potentially signal sepa-\nrately. Despite these data and corresponding data on the\npossible phosphotransfer patterns [16], the way the\nsignal is transmitted and integrated between the chemo-\ntaxis clusters to control flagella activity is currently\nunknown [17]. This is a good example of the difficulty of\ninferring a network structure from homology alone. The\ncurrent known connectivity and protein localisation is\nshown in Figure 1.\nIn this paper, we apply our method of model invalida-\ntion to different possible and plausible connectivity\nstructures in the chemotaxis pathway of R. sphaeroides. In\nparticular, we use the model invalidation\/experiment\ndesign cycle outlined above, in order to shed light on the\nsignalling pathway in R. sphaeroides.\nResults\nA method for discriminating between competing\nnetwork models\nA general method for designing experiments so as to\nrender the outputs of candidate models as different as\npossible is described. These experiments can then be\nperformed in the laboratory and, when compared to the\nmodel predictions, allow the invalidation of some of the\ncandidate models, even when the experimental data set\nis noisy.\nOur method involves the development of ODE models\ncorresponding to different signalling pathway connectiv-\nities, all of which can explain current wild type\nexperimental data equally well. The models have in\ncommon all currently known interactions and differ in\nthat each model represents a new speculative pathway\nconnectivity. Some parameters in these models are\nknown and some others are unknown. Thus in principle,\none can develop a \u201cset\u201d of models with uncertain\nparameters for a particular signalling structure, each\nmember of this set representing the wild type experi-\nmental data equally well. We would want to discriminate\nbetween these \u201csets\u201d of models (which represent signal-\nling pathway structures) but since this is a very hard\nproblem, our method uses a nominal model from each\nset and then designs an experiment in order to\ndiscriminate between these nominal models. Once the\ndiscriminatory experiments between the nominal mod-\nels are designed in silico, we a posteriori assess the\ndiscriminatory property of the stimulus by simulating\nthe behaviour for many, randomly chosen, models\nwithin these sets in order to see whether the outputs\nfrom the two model sets remain distinguishable.\nThe discriminatory experiments were designed by initi-\nally determining the input profile that maximises the\nmagnitude of the squared output difference between\nmodels over time. This is typically an optimal control\nproblem, which is often laborious to solve and can result\nin an input profile that is difficult to realize experimen-\ntally [18]. In order to design the input profile in a\nnumerically efficient manner, we used the following\nresult from linear systems theory: for a linear time-\ninvariant system, the input that produces the largest\nenergy output given an input of fixed energy is a\n(truncated) sinusoid of a particular frequency [19]. The\nfrequency can be obtained using a Bode plot (see\nMethods section), a tool which is often used in control\nFigure 1\nThe chemotaxis pathway of R. sphaeroides. The\ncurrently known localisation and connectivity of the\nchemotaxis pathway in R. sphaeroides is shown. The\nlocalisation of the two signalling clusters, one at the pole and\none in the cytoplasm was determined by GFP fusions and\nimmunoflouresence [15]. The remaining connectivities, was\ndetermined be in vitro phosphotransfer measurements and by\nmutant data [16,21]. It is currently unknown what role\nCheY3 and CheY4 perform in the system.\nBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:105 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/3\/105\nPage 3 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nand systems theory [20]. Thus, we first linearised the\nmodels and then determined this particular frequency of\na sinusoidal input corresponding to the error system, i.e.\nthe difference between the two models.\nIf the above method is insufficient to discriminate\nbetween the models then a further method of \u2018mutating\u2019\nthe two models in biological terms or changing para-\nmeters\/initial conditions (e.g. alter the initial protein\nconcentrations) in engineering terms is applied to\nachieve discrimination. These changes can be tested in\nsilico to determine those which will discriminate best\nbetween the models under test, before undertaking\nexperiments. The exact nature of the perturbation that\ncan be performed will vary with the system being\ninvestigated, but could include altering protein levels\nby knockout, knockdown (e.g. RNAi in eukaryotes),\nprotein over expression, etc. Thus the space of perturba-\ntion which can be searched will be defined by what is\npossible to implement experimentally in the biological\nsystem under investigation.\nThe designed experiments can then be implemented and the\ndata obtained from such laboratory experiments used to\nhelp us differentiate between the models under study, by\ninvalidation. In the above procedure we used deterministic\nmodels and a worst-case input design procedure, therefore\neven if the data are noisy, we expected that we would still be\nable to invalidate some of these models.\nDetermining pathway connectivity in\nR. sphaeroides chemotaxis\nWe applied our model invalidation method to elucidate\nunknown interconnections within the R. sphaeroides\nchemotactic signalling pathway. In vitro phosphorylation\nmeasurements have determined some of the internal\nconnectivity and genetic work has shown that only CheY6\nand either CheY3 or CheY4 are required for motor switching\nand that CheY6 canbind to themotor [21] (Figure 1).Whilst\nit has been shown in vitro that all CheYs 1-6 can interact with\nFliM, the rotor switch [22], it is currently unknown whether\nCheY3 and CheY4 proteins cause flagellamotor switching or\nwhether some CheYs have an effect on other parts of the\nsignalling pathway to influence the motor indirectly, for\nexample, by acting as a phosphate sink.\nModel creation and parameter estimation\nWe created a number of different models representing\nvarious plausible CheY3, CheY4 connectivities within the\nchemotaxis system (Figure 2; Methods; SMBL in Addi-\ntional File 1). Each of these models contains all the\ncurrently known connectivities, shown in Figure 1, but\ndiffers in which unknown connectivity is considered. To\nallow each of our models to represent current, wild type\nobservations equally well, we fitted the unknown\nparameters of each model (K1-3) such that the error\nbetween model prediction and wild type data is small\n(Figure 3). These parameters represented the activation\nof the receptor on the CheA (K1), and the effect of and\nrate of methylation on the receptor (K2,3). These values\nare currently unknown biologically. The fitting results in\nthe models with different connectivities having different\nsuch parameter values.\nWe obtained the following values for the parameters for\nthe different models (the units for values of K1 are in \u03bcM,\nand in 1\nsec\nfor K2 and K3):\n\u2022 blue: K1 = 1, K2 = 16.5 and K3 = 0.015\n\u2022 red: K1 = 25, K2 = 3250 and K3 = 0.075\n\u2022 grey: K1 = 1, K2 = 97.5 and K3 = 0.0023\n\u2022 magenta: K1 = 1, K2 = 0.4 and K3 = 0.011\nWe assumed that these parameters are the same for the\npolar and cytoplasic clusters, so K Ki i= \u0004 .\nFigure 2\nThe models of the R. sphaeroides chemotaxis system.\nThe different connecitvities modelled for CheY3 and CheY4\nare shown in this diagram. The coloured lines represent\nthree models presented in this paper. In the blue model\nCheY3-P and CheY4-P bind to FliM in the motor\nco-operatively with CheY6-P. In the red model CheY3 and\nCheY4 form a connection with the cytoplasmic cluster and\nact antagonistically to ligand in altering the kinase activity of\nCheA4; therefore, the increase in CheY3\/4-P acts to increase\nthe rate of CheA3 phosphorlyation by CheA4. In the magenta\nmodel CheY3\/4 interact with CheA3 preventing CheY6\nbinding and hence phosphotransfer. The fourth model\ncorresponds to a model, in which CheY3 and CheY4 act as\nphosphate sinks only and hence do not interact with\nanything. This is referred to as the grey model in this paper.\nIt should be noted that the other three models also contain\nthis interconnection and that the difference in the grey\nmodel is that only this connection exists.\nBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:105 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/3\/105\nPage 4 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWe used the Pearson product-moment correlation\ncoefficient as a measure of correlation between model\nprediction and data. For 200 \u2264 t \u2264 800 seconds, we found\na good correlation between data and the predictions\nmade by the models. For example, we obtained a\ncoefficient of 0.9466 for the blue model and of 0.9544\nfor the red model.\nTo ensure our models can fit all current experimental\ndata we then compared the output of all models to data\npreviously determined for the deletion of various genes\nwithin R. sphaeroides [21]. One possible plausible\nconnectivity contains CheY3 and CheY4 acting only as\nphosphate sinks, similar to the roles of the multiple\nCheY\u2019s in S. meliloti [13,14]. However, the model\nrepresenting this connectivity (grey model) was unable\nto fit mutant experimental data as it still showed\nchemotaxis in a CheY3Y4 deletion state (\u0394CheY3Y4).\nAnother possible connectivity where CheY3 and CheY4\ncan bind to CheA3 preventing CheY6 binding and hence\nphosphorylation was also considered (magenta model).\nHowever, this connectivity was unable to fit experimen-\ntal data as it remained chemotactic in a \u0394CheY3Y4 state\n(Figure 4A). To strengthen our conclusion that both\nFigure 3\nFitting model parameters. The three parameters K1 - K3 are unknown and thus the models were fitted to wild type data in\norder to obtain them.

We\nobserved that, even when we allowed for greatly different\nparameter configurations, the connecitvities modelled by\nthe magenta and grey models are still chemotactic, hence\nour invalidation is robust (Figure 4B). As opposed to the\ngrey and magenta model, the red and the blue model\ncannot be invalidated by above deletion data.\nWe then designed an experiment to invalidate one or\nboth of the remaining two models following the model-\ninvalidation cyclic procedure described in the back-\nground section. As mentioned previously, we chose a\nsinusoidal input with a particular frequency to help\ndiscriminate between the models. Using a Bode plot\nshowing the response of the difference of the outputs to\na sinusoidal input with fixed amplitude, we determined\nan input frequency (in terms of frequency of 100 \u03bcM\namplitude ligand application) in order to discriminate\nbest between the remaining two models (Figure 5A). We\nchose an input period of four minutes, which was both\nclose to the optimal in terms of discrimination and easy\nto implement experimentally. We then ran simulations\nof the time evolution of the models with alternating step\ninputs mimicking a sinusoidal input of this period (as\nthis mirrors what can be implemented experimentally)\nto ensure that the difference in the outputs was\nsufficiently large to be accurately measured experimen-\ntally (Figure 5B).\nTable 1: Reaction rates used in the R. sphaeroides chemotaxis\nmodels\nreaction parameter(s) value(s)\n(R1) A2 \u00c6 A2p k1 0.03 s-1\n(R2) A2p+ B1 \u21cc A2 + B1p k k2 2\n+ \u2212, 0.035(\u03bcMs)-1,\n0.01(\u03bcMs)-1\n(R3) A2p + Y3 \u21cc A2 + Y3p k k3 3\n+ \u2212, 0.065 (\u03bcMs)-1, 0\n(R4) A2p + Y4 \u21cc A2 + Y4p k k4 4\n+ \u2212, 0.004(\u03bcMs)-1, 0\n(R5) A2p + Y6 \u21cc A2 + Y6p k k5 5\n+ \u2212, 0.0006(\u03bcMs)-1, 0\n(R6) A2p + B2 \u21cc A2 + B2p k k6 6\n+ \u2212, 0.0035(\u03bcMs)-1,\n0.01(\u03bcMs)-1\n(R7) B1p \u00c6 B1 k7 0\n(R8) Y3p \u00c6 Y3 K8 0.08s-1\n(R9) Y4p \u00c6 Y4 K9 0.02s-1\n(R10) Y6p \u00c6 Y6 K10 0.1s-1\n(R11) B2p \u00c6 B2 K11 0.015s-1\n(R12) A3A4p + Y6 \u21cc A3A4+ Y6p k k12 12\n+ \u2212, 0.1 (\u03bcMs)-1, 0\n(R13) A3A4p + B2 \u21cc A3A4 + B2p k k13 13\n+ \u2212, 0.006(\u03bcMs)-1,\n0.07(\u03bcMs)-1\n(R14) A3A4 \u00c6 A3A4p k14 0.02s-1\nThe reaction rates used for the models determined by fitting\nphosphotransfer in vitro experiments [16,31].

B] The robustness of our invalidation of the\ngrey and magenta models was tested by running 200\nsimulations of the model lacking CheY3 and CheY4, allowing\nparameters k1 - k14 to vary by \u00b1 50%. None of these changes\nproduced a non-chemotactic model.\nBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:105 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/3\/105\nPage 6 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWe observed that the difference between the outputs of the\ntwo models under consideration was insufficient to allow\ndiscrimination between the models experimentally using\nthis discrimination technique. Therefore, we sought experi-\nmental perturbations which resulted in a larger difference\nbetween the outputs of the different models. Possible\nexperimental perturbations in this system involve deletions\nof one or more components, over expression or under\nexpression of a protein component and growth of the\nbacteria in different growth conditions; the latter results in\nlarge-scale changes of the expression of the chemotaxis\noperons and hence protein concentrations.\nBefore experimental implementation, we tested the\npossible perturbations in silico. The over expression of\nCheY4 was chosen as this resulted in a large difference in\nboth the models\u2019 steady states and their dynamical\nbehaviour (Figure 6A). Moreover, in order to ensure that\nthis discrimination is not influenced by errors in\ndetermining parameter values, we confirmed that our\nfindings are relatively robust to parameter changes. We\nallowed all parameters to vary by \u00b1 15% and still\nobserved the same clear difference in the behaviour of\nthe models (Figure 6C).\nFigure 5\nModel discrimination by optimal frequency. A] Bode\nplot determining the optimal input frequency for model\ndiscrimination. The Bode magnitude plot shows the output\namplitude gain, g\u03c9, versus frequency \u03c9 (in decibel; that is in\n20 log(g\u03c9)). Here, the gain corresponds to the ratio of the\ndifference between the outputs of the blue and the red\nmodel, and the input amplitude (sinusoidal input); in other\nwords, the maximum denotes at which frequency one can\nexpect to see the largest difference between the models. The\naim was to determine the optimal input frequency to apply to\nthe system. This was determined to have a period of\n4 minutes. B] Outputs of the simulation for the behaviour of\nthe models with this optimal frequency applied as the input\nfrequency demonstrating that the best input perturbation\nalone is not enough to discriminate between the two models.\nThe coloured lines represent the models defined in Figure 2.\nFigure 6\nDiscrimination by optimal initial conditions.

C]\nRobust invalidation of the blue model. To ensure that our\ninvalidation was robust we ran 500 simulations assuming that\nCheY4 is 5-fold over-expressed. We vary parameters k1 - k14\nby \u00b1 15% and still observe the same clear difference between\nthe behaviour of the blue and of the red model.\nBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:105 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/3\/105\nPage 7 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWe then used IPTG to experimentally induce the over\nexpression of CheY4 from an expression plasmid. The\nlevel of CheY4 over expression as a population average\nwas verified using semi-quantitative western blotting\n(data not shown). We observed that when CheY4 is over-\nexpressed to five times the wild type level the tethered cell\ntrace was similar to that of wild type cells (Figure 6B);\nthis suggested that the model, in which the CheY6 and\nCheY3 or CheY4 bind to the motor co-operatively\n(blue model) and do not have other interactions, is\ninvalid, as it is unable to represent our new experimental\ndata (Figure 6B). Since the red model, where there is an\ninterconnection between CheY3 and CheY4 and the\ncytoplasmic cluster altering the CheA4 kinase activity, can\nrepresent this data, it is the only model we cannot\ninvalidate (Figure 6B).\nDiscussion\nWe have developed a methodology for elucidating\nbiological signalling pathways which we applied to\nunderstanding the chemotactic signalling pathway in\nR. sphaeroides. Our method differs from many other\nmethods currently in use in that is based on manipula-\ntion and observation of the entire biological system\nunder in vivo conditions and, importantly, offers a\nsystematic approach to model invalidation based on\ncyclic model development\/experiment design iterations.\nIn particular, it does not aim at designing experiments\nfor the refinement of parameter values, but rather at\nidentifying possible interconnection structures. By doing\nso, our method considers a model representing a specific\nstructure that it aims to invalidate.\nWe applied our method to a real biological system and\nsuccessfully managed to invalidate some potential\nsignalling pathway network models. Thus, this method\nhelped to more rationally consider the interconnectivity\nof the chemotactic signalling pathway in R. sphaeroides\nthrough relatively simple input-output experiments\nin vivo and helps to design rational future experiments.\nThe method is applicable to other biological systems but\nrequires an experimental setup where it is possible to\ncontrol the input and measure the output simulta-\nneously. Even with this limitation the method could be\nused for both pathway determination and parameter\ndetermination, where multiple models with different\nparameters could be systematically invalidated. Our\nmethod could potentially be used to help annotate and\nunderstand signalling pathways in non-model organ-\nisms, using the information from model organisms as a\nguide for the first model generation step. These could\nthen be tested and models invalidated. A parameter\nsearch could also be performed by creating models\nwhich deviate from the model organism data and then,\nthrough model invalidation, determining which para-\nmeter sets are able to fit the experimental data. In all\nthese cases though, the input of the system must be\nunder experimental control and the output easily\nmeasured.\nA potential limitation would be the case in which two\nmodels from different network structures produce out-\nputs that are indistinguishable under all potential\nexperimental conditions. The problem in this case\ncould lie with the particular properties of the network\nand their discriminatory nature - i.e., whether such\ndifferences in structure are identifiable from input-\noutput experiments [23]. Performing all calculations in\nsilico before any experiments are undertaken is important\nin saving experimental time ensuring that experiments\nare only performed when the results will have discrimi-\nnating property between the models under test.\nIn the system studied in this paper the modelling and\nexperiment design was done on average cell traces for\nR. sphaeroides responses. The reason for this is that single\ncell behaviour is noisy, and in any case the model\nparameters we have available at the start of the\nprocedure correspond to the average system behaviour.\nThe total protein concentrations, for example, are the\npopulation average determined for these growth condi-\ntions. Thus the model output is for the \u2018average\u2019 cell\nhence we compared the output to the average of the\ntethered cell data.\nWhen constructing the models we used in vitro rates as it\nis very difficult, if not impossible to measure these rates\nin vivo. The multiple homologues in R. sphaeroides would\nprevent a FRET assay such as the one applied to E. coli\nbeing used. Thus the parameters are the best estimate of\nthe real value. To allow for this uncertainty we\nconsidered models where these parameters were varied\nto ensure robust invalidation. Also for simplicity in the\nmodelling we did not consider the increased concentra-\ntion of the CheAs at specific points in the cell due to\nclustering nor the effects of clustering. This is because the\nexact concentration of CheA in specific regions and the\neffects of clustering are currently impossible to measure\nexperimentally. The fitted parameter K1, which relates\nthe activation of the ligand on the receptor, includes the\neffect of clustering and as such it is accounted for in our\nmodels. To ensure that this is robust we also allowed the\nconcentration of the CheA proteins to vary sufficiently\nand our invalidation conclusion was still correct.\nInterestingly, the connectivity that best fits the experi-\nmental data suggests that in R. sphaeroides CheY3-P and\/\nor CheY4-P do not bind co-operatively with CheY6 to\nBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:105 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/3\/105\nPage 8 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nFliM. The model we have been unable to invalidate\nsuggests that CheY3-P and CheY4-P form a link between\nthe polar and cytoplasmic signalling clusters, helping\ntransmit the signal between the two clusters. We have\nthrough modelling and comparing to experimental data\ninvalidated a model representing the previously held\nhypothesis that CheY3 and CheY4 act only as phosphate\nsinks for the system. We have also invalidated a model\nwith strict co-operative binding of CheY\u2019s at the motor\nand as such our technique adds to the body of\nknowledge on R. sphaeroides chemotaxis.\nConclusion\nIn this paper we have developed a control engineering\nmethod for elucidating biological signalling pathways\nand applied it to a real system. This method is based on\nmultiple model creation and subsequent invalidation\nusing in silico designed experiments. This is a general\nmethod that can be applied to other biological pathways\nwhere it is possible to control the input and measure the\noutput in simultaneously. We used the method to\ninvalidate all but one model for the chemotaxis\nsignalling pathway in R. sphaeroides and in doing so\nhave invalidated models of certain possible connectiv-\nities.\nMethods\nStrains and growth conditions\nBacterial strains and plasmids are listed in Table 2.\nR. sphaeroides strains were grown aerobically in succinate\nmedium [24] at 30\u00b0C with shaking. When appropriate,\nthe antibiotics nalidixic acid and kanamycin were used at\n25 \u03bcgml-1.\nProtein over expression\npIND4-Y4 was transformed into S-17 and conjugated\ninto R. sphaeroides as described previously [25]. IPTG was\nadded to cell culture at 100 \u03bcM and the cells incubated\nfor ~16 hours at 30\u00b0C until OD700 is 0.6, where the cells\nwere then used for tethered cell analysis.\nTethered cell analysis\nR. sphaeroides was grown to an OD700 of 0.6 and then 4 \u00d7\n1 ml of cells were harvested. 3 \u00d7 1 ml were saved for\nwestern blot analysis. The remaining 1 ml was pelted and\nresuspended in tethering buffer (10 mM Na-HEPES pH\n7.2 containing chloramphenicol at 50 \u03bcg\/ml) and\nincubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 mins.\nThe cells were then tethered in a humidity chamber by\nincubation of 10 \u03bcl of cell suspension on a coverslip with\n1 \u03bcl of anti-flagellar antibody for 30 mins.\nThe coverslip was then loaded onto a flow chamber and\ntethering buffer passed through for 5 min to remove free\ncells. After this period the tethered cells were observed\nunder phase contrast at 1000 \u00d7 magnification. Real time\nrecordings were made on videotape. Tethering buffer\nwith and without Propionate (sodium salt) was passed\nthrough the chamber at a rate of 0.09 ml\/min.\nThe video recordings were analysed with the Hobson\nBactracker (Hobson Tracking Systems) using the program\nArot7. The rotation rate of the cells was measured by\ndetecting the position of the cell every 50 ms. The data\nobtained were smoothed (100 points), averaged (for as\nmany cells as available - at least 20 per graph) and plotted.\nWestern blotting\nIn order to determine protein concentrations semi\nquantitative western blots were employed as described\npreviously [26].\nModelling the chemotaxis pathway in R. sphaeroides\nOur model is split into three modules: sensing,\ntransduction and actuation.\nSensing\nWe assumed the same underlying mechanisms for\ntransmembrane (MCP) and the cytoplasmic (Tlp)\nreceptors.

We\nassumed some nonspecific interaction, which does not\nlead to a long lasting binding of proteins to motor sites,\neither between CheY6-P, CheY3-P and CheY4-P and the\nmotor, or only between CheY6-P and the motor. For the\nblue model we investigated also a different type of CheY\nmotor binding shown below in brackets. This model\nshowed a similar behaviour to the other blue model in\nsimulations and analysis (data not shown) and so we\nonly discussed the findings of the first binding type.\nMotor activity decreases at a constant rate in the absence\nof the CheY\u2019s, which we assumed to be 1sec . We modeled\nthe behaviour of the different models as follows:\n\u0005\n\u0005\nM Y Y Y M\nM Y\nY p Y p\nK Y p Y\nb p p p b\nb p\n= + \u2212\n=\n+\n+ +\n[ ]([ ] [ ])\n[ ]\n[ 3 ] [ 4 ]\n4 [ 3 ] [ 4\n6 3 4\n6(\np\nM Kb]\n0 754\u2212 = where . .)\n(16)\n\u0005M Y Mr p r= \u22126 (17)\n\u0005M Y Mg p g= \u22126 (18)\n\u0005M Y Mm p m= \u22126 (19)\nThe output of the models is flagella activity that we can\nalso observe in tethered cell assays. We used the\nfollowing heuristic description to convert motor activity\ninto R. sphaeroides body rotations, observed in the\ntethered cell assays (given in rot\/sec):\ny\nS Mi\ni b r g mi =\n\u2212\n+\n=\n1\n( 2)\n, , , , (20)\nWe set S = 0.125, which means that saturation occurs at\n-8 rot\/sec.\nParameter fitting\nIn order to fit model parameters such that the model\nrepresents well the experimental data, we minimised the\n2-norm of the vector, whose entries consist of the errors\nbetween data and predictions from the discretised version\nof the ODE models representing the individual chemical\nreactions investigated in vitro. The 2-norm of vector x is\ngiven by x x xn1\n2\n2\n2 2+ + +\u2026 , where n is the length of x.\nIn order to fit any remaining model parameters to data\nfrom in vivo experiments, we simulated the model and\nminimised the 1-norm of the vector, whose entries are\nthe errors between data and model predictions [32]. The\n1-norm of vector x is given by |x1| + |x2| + ... + |xn|\nFitting model parameters for receptor activation\nParameters K1 - K3 are unknown and cannot be easily\nmeasured by experiments. To determine these we fitted\nBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:105 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/3\/105\nPage 11 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nthe models to wild type tethering data. We performed\ntethered cell experiments where we applied 100 \u03bcM of\nattractant for 5 minutes and then removed it. We then\nran a simulation of each model (Figure 3). To obtain Kis\nand \u0004K i s, we minimised the error between computer\nsimulations and data following the online fitting\nprocedure. For simplicity and because we are fitting the\nmodels to a single model output only, which is\ncontaminated with noise, we let Ki = \u0004K i .\nLeast squares minimisation to fit phosphotransfer parameters\nWe used least squares minimisation to fit all other\nparameters from phosphotransfer experimental data. In\ngeneral, we considered a chemical reaction network with\nmass action kinetics of the following form:\n\u0005x Af x x An n m= \u2208 \u2208 \u00d7( ), , ,R R (21)\nwhere f(\u00b7) \u0152 Rm is a vector of known monomials. Let the\nvalue of the entries of matrix A, which correspond to\nreaction rate constants, be unknown. What we wished to\nfind is the entries in matrix A, given experimental data.\nFor that purpose, we considered the following discrete-\ntime system:\nx t x t t t Af x tq q q q q( ) ( ) ( ) ( ( )),1 1+ += + \u2212 (22)\nwhich is the Euler discretisation of (21). Here, each x(tq)\ndenotes a measurement at time tq. The set of experi-\nmental measurements, which we denote by x\u02c6 , was used\nto fit the unknown entries to A such as to minimise the\nerror between the data and the model predictions, which\nare given by (22). We solved the following optimisation\nproblem which minimises the 2-norm of the error\nbetween model prediction and observation (least\nsquares minimisation):\nmin\n\u02c6 \u02c6 \u02c6\n\u02c6 \u02c6\nx t x t t t Af x t\nx t x t t tp p p p\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ( ))\n( ) ( ) (\n1 2 2 1 1\n1\n\u2212 + \u2212\n\u2212 + \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n#\n1 1\n2\n) ( ( ))\n,\nAf x t p\u02c6 \u2212\n\u23a1\n\u23a3\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a4\n\u23a6\n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\n(23)\nwhere p corresponds to the number of measurements.\nUsing phosphotransfer data [16,31] and the above\nmethod under the constraint that the rates are non-\nnegative, we obtained values for parameters k1 - k14\n(Table 1).\nOnline fitting\nBecause the least squares optimisation is applied to a\ndiscretised version of a continuous time model, we\napplied the method of steepest descent online - that is, we\nminimise the error between simulations of the\ncontinuous-time model and the data - to improve the\nfit using the values obtained before.\nExperiment design\nInput design\nIn ordered to discriminate between models by determin-\ning an input, which results in the largest difference in the\noutputs of the models we wished to determine the\noptimal input frequency. For example consider the red\nand the blue model, shown in Figure 2, representing\ndifferent connectivities. The models are given by\nordinary differential equations of the form:\n\u0005 \u0005x f x g x u x f x g x u1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2( ) ( , ), ( ) ( , )= + = + (24)\nHere, xi is the vector with the different states (for example,\nconcentrations of different proteins) of the model i, i = 1,\n2, fi and gi are functions that represent the different\nmodels, and u is the input, which can be externally\ncontrolled; for example, ligand concentrations.\nIf gi(xi, 0) = 0 then the two models should have the same\nequilibrium point x* in order to represent the data\nequally well:\nf x f x1 2( ) ( ) 0* *= =\nMoreover, we required that x* is asymptotically stable.\nThe measured output is given by\ny h xi i i= ( ), (25)\nwhere hi is the output function. In order to be able to\ndiscriminate well between two different competing\nmodels the outputs of the two should be as different\nas possible. Thus, we determined the input that\nmaximised the following difference assuming all other\nmodel parameters constant:\n0\n1 2 1 2( ) ( )\n\u03c4\u222b \u2212 \u2212y y y y tT d . (26)\nHere, \u03c4 denotes the duration of the experiment. To\nobtain an input that maximises (27) for a nonlinear\nsystem of the form (24)-(25) is difficult. However, if we\nrelax the problem to obtaining the sinusoidal input to\nthe system given by the linearisation of (24)-(25) that\nmaximises (26) then it can be solved systematically as\nwe show in the following.\nConsider a linear system\n\u0005x Ax Bu y Cx= + =, , (27)\nwhere A, B and C are matrices, whose entries depend on\nthe model parameters, and u(t) = a sin(\u03c9t) is a\nBMC Systems Biology 2009, 3:105 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1752-0509\/3\/105\nPage 12 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nsinusoidal input with angular frequency \u03c9 and fixed\namplitude a. System (27) is the so called state space\nrepresentation of the model in the time domain. It is\ncommon in control systems engineering to investigate\nthe behaviour of such a system in dependency of \u03c9,\nwhich requires to transform the system to the so called\nfrequency domain. If matrix A is Hurwitz (stable) then\nafter some transient behaviour output y is given by a\nsinusoidal wave that is, first, phase shifted with respect\nto u and second, has amplitude a\u02c6 . Here we are only\ninterested in the maximum of a\u02c6 with respect to \u03c9.\nWe denoted the Laplace transform of u and y by U(s) and\nY(s), where s is a complex independent variable. Then,\nY s G s U s( ) ( ) ( ).=\nG(s) is called the transfer function [33] and is given by\nG s C sI A B( ) ( ) .1= \u2212 \u2212\nNote that in our analysis the only independent variable\nis \u03c9. We replaced s by j\u03c9 (s = j\u03c9), where j = \u22121 . The\nBode magnitude plot shows the value of a\u02c6\na\n. Thus, the\nmaximum in the plot provides the frequency that will\nmaximise the output to input ratio.\nWe linearised (9) to (20) to obtain a system of the form\ngiven by (27). We determined the frequency of the\nsinusoidal input that will result in the largest difference\nbetween the model outputs as described above. Finally,\nwe simulated the experimental output of this optimal\nfrequency.\nInitial conditions design\nChoosing the change or possible combination of\nchanges that provides best discrimination between the\ndifferent models is a combinatorial problem and\ndifficult to solve efficiently. However, because for our\nchemotaxis models the range of possible changes was\nrelatively small, due to being limited by what can be\nimplemented experimentally, we performed a brute force\nsearch, checking all possibilities. The five-fold over\nexpression of CheY4 under microaerobic growth condi-\ntions yielded the best result in silico in discriminating\nbetween the red and the blue model.\nRobustness of invalidation\nIn order to assess whether our invalidation conclusions\nare robust to parameter changes, we performed a\nsensitivity analysis on our models. We ran 500 simula-\ntions allowing parameters k1 and k14 to vary by \u00b1 15%\n(Figure 4C). Even with these variations, we were able\nreach the same conclusions.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nMR provided the information to construct the models\nand performed all the microbiological experiments and\ndata analysis.
