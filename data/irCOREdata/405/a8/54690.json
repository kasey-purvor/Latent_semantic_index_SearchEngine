The\nanalysis necessary to predict the behaviour of such converters is also given. The oscillation is based\non the behaviour of a hysteretic relay with a negative hysteresis transition. Self-oscillating converters\nbenefit from higher efficiency\/higher power density than their non-self-oscillating counterparts as they\ncan be operated closer to the tank resonant frequency. The self-oscillating mechanism presented here is\nalso simple and cost effective to implement. A prototype converter is presented in order to verify the\ntheoretical claims.\nIntroduction\nIn recent times, there has been a growing interest in driving resonant converters in a self-oscillating\nmanner. Whilst such techniques have become common-place in lamp-ballasts[1], self-oscillating control\ntechniques are only just beginning to gain sway in the field of DC-DC resonant converters, principally\nbecause of the added complication involved in designing the converter and control system.\nThere are a number of advantages to allowing a converter to self oscillate compared to forced fre-\nquency control techniques, which have traditionally been more popular with DC-DC converters. The\nmost prominent advantage is that it compensates for variations in the tolerances of components, allowing\nthe converter to be driven much closer to resonance whilst maintaining zero-voltage switching (ZVS).\nThis compares very favourably with forced-frequency control techniques, where the designer must allow\nsome tolerance between the lowest frequency at which the converter will operate, and the converter\u2019s real\nresonant frequency (see Figure 1).\nIn the field of DC-DC converter technology, self-oscillating converters are scarce, with externally im-\nposed switching frequencies being used in the majority of cases. There are a number of approaches to\ninducing self-oscillation in a resonant converter. One example is phase or power-factor control. Such\nschemes work by timing the length of a converter cycle, and using the information to calculate the time at\nwhich the inverter stage of the converter should switch to apply a particular phase difference between the\nconverter input current and voltage, thereby controlling the power factor, and the amount of real power is\ntransfered [2]. Another approach is to sense some aspect of the resonant tank, and switch when the signal\npasses through certain points [3]. There a number of ways of modelling this behaviour, relay systems\nbeing a prime candidate [4, 1, 5].\nHere then, an analysis technique is described for low-cost self-oscillating LCLC resonant DC-DC con-\nverters using relay systems theory in order to predict steady-state oscillation behaviour using non-\ncomputationally intensive methods[1]. The converter chosen is a series-parallel LCLC topology (see\nFigure 2). This topology has the advantage that parasitics in an isolating transformer can readily be\nincorporated into the design of the resonant tank (Lp and Ls being mainly attributed to a transformer\u2019s\nLmagnetisation and Lstray respectively). However, it should be noted that the underlying principles are ulti-\nmately applicable to the wider field of resonant converter topologies.\nFrequency\nPo\nw\ner\nTolerance margin\nMIssed\noperating range\nFigure 1: Unused capability in a conventional resonant DC-DC converter\n+\n\u2212\nVdc\nLs\nCs\nCp Lp\nD1\nD2\nD3\nD4\nCf Rl\nQ1\nQ2 Vin\nVout\nLf\nFigure 2: Circuit diagram of power section of self oscillating converter\nRelay System Analysis\nFor the converter to self-oscillate, the switching instances are dictated by the current through the series\ninductor (iLs). Switching occurs when iLs passes through certain values, as shown in Figure 3. This in\neffect allows the frequency of the converter to be controlled by changing the value of iLs at which the\nswitching instance occurs. Altering the value of iLs at which the input voltage is switched has the effect of\naltering the phase difference (P) between the driving voltageVin and the inductor current, thereby altering\nthe power-factor of the converter and allowing the amount of real power delivered into the converter to\nbe controlled. Thus, a mechanism exists for controlling the proximity to the resonant frequency at which\nthe converter operates, but without dictating the frequency in the control system. The lower the value of\niLs at which the driving voltage is switched, the closer the converter operates to the resonant frequency.\nExciting the converter with the hysteresis width (\u03b5) set to 0 puts Vin and iLs in phase, and the converter\nruns at its resonant frequency. To achieve the desired effect, a hysteretic relay with a negative hysteresis\nband (characteristic shown in Figure 4(a)) is used to control the switches [1, 4].\nTo analyse the system using relay systems techniques, a linear approximation of the converter and load\nmust first be made. For this purpose, a fundamental mode approximation (FMA) [6, 7] is used to replace\nthe load and rectifier with a simple resistor. Using this approximation, the conductance of the circuit as\n0  P 0.5T T 1.5T\n\u2212iLs peak\n\u2212e\n0   \ne\niLs peak\nVdc\nSwitching\nPoints\niLs\nVin\nFigure 3: Switching instance in a self-oscillating resonant converter\n(a) Hysteresis characteristic of relay (b) Closed loop of converter\nFigure 4: Relay and system\nseen by the power switches can be calculated easily using simple linear circuit analysis.\nYtank =\n\u2212(CpCsLpRlFMA +CpCsLpRCp) j\u03c9\n3\n\u2212((CpCsRlFMA +CpCsRCp)RLp +CpCsRCpRlFMA +CsLp)\u03c9\n2\n+(CsRLp +CsRlFMA) j\u03c9\nCpCsLpLs(RlFMA +RCp)\u03c9\n4\n\u2212(CpCsLp(RlFMA(RLs +RCs +RCp)+RCp(RLs +RCs))\n+CpCsLs(RlFMA(RCp +RLp)+RCpRLp)+CsLpLs) j\u03c9\n3\n\u2212(CpCs(RlFMA(RLp(RLs +RCs +RCp)+RCp(RLs\n+RCs))+RCpRLp(RLs +RCs))\n+CsLp(RLs +RlFMA +RCs)+CsLs(RLp +RlFMA)\n+CpLp(RlFMA +RCp))\u03c9\n2\n+(Cs(RlFMA(RLs +RLp +RCs)+RLp(RLs +RCs))\n+Cp(RlFMA(RLp +RCp)+RCpRLp)+Lp) j\u03c9\n+RlFMA +RLp\n(1)\ns can be substituted for j\u03c9 to become the transfer function from Vin to iLs :\nGtank(s) =\n(CpCsLpRlFMA +CpCsLpRCp)s\n3\n+((CpCsRlFMA +CpCsRCp)RLp +CpCsRCpRlFMA +CsLp)s\n2\n+(CsRLp +CsRlFMA)s\nCpCsLpLs(RlFMA +RCp)s\n4\n+(CpCsLp(RlFMA(RLs +RCs +RCp)+RCp(RLs +RCs))\n+CpCsLs(RlFMA(RCp +RLp)+RCpRLp)+CsLpLs)s\n3\n+(CpCs(RlFMA(RLp(RLs +RCs +RCp)+RCp(RLs\n+RCs))+RCpRLp(RLs +RCs))\n+CsLp(RLs +RlFMA +RCs)+CsLs(RLp +RlFMA)\n+CpLp(RlFMA +RCp))s\n2\n+(Cs(RlFMA(RLs +RLp +RCs)+RLp(RLs +RCs))\n+Cp(RlFMA(RLp +RCp)+RCpRLp)+Lp)s\n+RlFMA +RLp\n(2)\nThe transfer function can then be used in closed-loop with the hysteretic relay to model the self-oscillating\nconverter, as in Figure 4(b).

Using the Hamel locus it is possible to identify possible modes\nof oscillation for a given value of hysteresis width (\u03b5) used in the relay controlling the switches. The\nHamel locus is used because the dominant oscillatory mode always forms the outer-most loop, and so\nthe mode that a real oscillating converter will adopt may be readily identified.\nPractical Converter\nTo verify the analysis in the preceding sections, a prototype converter is realised. For the purposes of\ndemonstrating a working self-oscillating fourth order DC-DC supply, a converter is specified to convert\n\u223c25W from 9V up to 18V. The resonant peak at 107.8kHz is the designed operating resonance.\nThe control system is implemented on a Xilinx CPLD and a Microchip PIC microcontroller, along with\nsome analogue sensing-electronics.\nThe series inductor current is not measured directly for the controller, but inferred from measurements\nof the voltage across the series inductor, as this is likely to be the technique envisaged in a commercial\nsolution, since current sensing is prohibitively expensive. It is notable that certain regions in the Hamel\nlocus are not single-valued functions of the switching threshold set on the series inductor current. In\npractice this is overcome by switching at certain points on the differential waveform (vLs) in those regions.\n\n\u22126 \u22125 \u22124 \u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1\nx 106\n\u22124\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nDerivative switching point (A\/s)\nSw\nitc\nhi\nng\n p\noi\nnt\n (A\n)\nmeasured\nsimulated\nFMA, relay system\nmodified FMA, relay system\nFigure 8: Hamel locus with alternative FMA approximation\nAssuming the smoothing inductor forces the rectifier to conduct continuously, the average input voltage,\nand hence the output voltage is:\nVout = Vabsav\u2212Vd (23)\nThe output current can then be obtained and referred back to the tank, as in standard FMA analysis\nIout =\nVout\nRl\n(24)\niRect \u2248\n4\npi\nIout sin(\u03c9t) (25)\nThe rectifier, output filter and load, can thus be represented by a new \u2019equivalent\u2019 value of resistance:\nRlFMAmod =\nvCp\niRect\n=\npi2v\u02c6CpRl\n8v\u02c6Cp \u22128piVd\n(26)\nThis set of equations can then be used in an iterative manner to provide an improved linear approximation\nfor the load presented to the resonant tank. The result of this approximation, as applied to the relay\nsystems analysis, is shown in the Hamel locus in Figure 8. It can be seen that the Hamel locus from this\ntechnique shows much better agreement with both the experimental and simulated results.\nConclusions\nA technique for driving Resonant DC-DC converters in a self-oscillating manner has been presented.\nThe technique offers a simple, non-computationally intensive generalised method for analysing self-\noscillating resonant converters. The proposed methodology is demonstrated to work well in practice,\nwith the predicted converter behaviour being in good agreement with that of both simulated and prototype\nconverters. Agreement between the theory and practice can be further improved with the application of\nthe modified FMA approximation, as outlined in the last section.\nReferences\n[1] C. Chang and G. W.
