INTRODUCTION\nPOWER conversion based on the excitation of a reso-nant tank network is considered appropriate when high\nswitching frequencies facilitate a significant reduction in the\nvolume\/mass of reactive circuit components. Through the use\nof zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and basic snubber circuitry,\nswitching losses can be significantly reduced [1]\u2013[4]. The\nvoltage-output LCC resonant converter (Fig. 1), while having\ngood part-load efficiency characteristics, is difficult to analyse\nas a result of the finite time taken to charge and discharge the\nparallel capacitor [5]\u2013[9]. Fundamental Mode Approximation\n(FMA), the most widely used technique for analysis, assumes\nthat the parallel capacitor waveform is a square-wave, which\n0885-8993\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nGILBERT et al.: NORMALIZED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 2387\nFig. 1. LCC voltage-output resonant converter.\ncan significantly degrade analysis accuracy. Here, the proposed\ntechniques inherently include the effects of the finite charge\nand discharge time, and normalize the converter\u2019s behavior\nsuch that the tank gain, at resonance, and the parallel- to se-\nries-capacitor ratio, fully characterize the frequency response,\nthe resonant tank component values, the electrical stresses and\nthe output voltage regulation performance. This is in contrast to\npreviously published normalization techniques [10]\u2013[12] based\non the series resonant frequency, which leads to the actual\nsystem resonant frequency and gain being unknown, thereby\nnot guaranteeing operation above the resonant frequency for a\nspecific design. The paper therefore considers three converter\noperating scenarios viz. operation at the resonant frequency,\nand operation above resonance for low and high loading con-\nditions. The resulting equations and graphical design curves\nare more readily employed than those previously reported\nsince it is not necessary to numerically solve simultaneous\nequations, as required in [10], for instance. Finally, it is shown\nthat in certain operating regions harmonics of the tank can be\nutilized to transfer real power which can ultimately be used as\na mechanism to reduce peak electrical stresses on components.\nA prototype converter is used to demonstrate the benefits of the\nproposed design process.\nThe series-parallel resonant converter topology combines the\nadvantages of the series resonant converter topology (without\n) with that of the parallel resonant converter (without ).\nThe series-resonant converter for example can only provide a\ngain 1\/2 when no transformer is used. The incorpo-\nration of the \u2018boost capacitor\u2019 allows effective input-output\ngains 1\/2 without the necessity of a transformer [2], [13], [14].\nII. CONVERTER OPERATION AT THE RESONANT FREQUENCY\nWhen operating at the resonant frequency, four modes\n(M1 M4) describe the converter\u2019s behavior over a single\nswitching period in steady-state, as defined by the example\nwaveforms in Fig. 2. Mode M1 corresponds to the period when\nis charging, while M2 corresponds to the rectifier conduc-\ntion period\u2014during this period the parallel capacitor voltage\nis clamped to the referred dc output voltage. Through\nsymmetry, M3 and M4 are similarly defined for the second half\ncycle.\nConverter behavior can be described by equivalent electrical\nnetworks, which, for operation during M1 and M2, are given\nin Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively, which can be used to derive a\npiecewise description of steady-state operation.\nFig. 2. Definition of modes for operation at resonance (a) voltages and\n(b) currents.\nFor simplicity the charge transfer through the series inductor\nduring the various modes will be written as follows:\n(1)\nwhere is the total time spent in mode and is the\ninitial time of the mode.\nAt resonance, the output voltage is given by:\n(2)\nwhere is the voltage gain of the tank at resonance .\nFrom Fig. 2(a), it can be seen that during M1 the parallel capac-\nitor charges from the most negative clamped voltage to the\nmost positive. The magnitude of the clamping voltage is equal to\nthe output voltage referred to the primary winding of the trans-\nformer . From (2), the total charge supplied to during\nM1 is\n(3)\nTo provide the initial conditions for each mode it is instruc-\ntive to consider expressions for the power flow in the converter.\nAssuming high efficiency operation, and the converter has suf-\nficient filter capacitance that can be considered constant over\na single switching period (consideration of rectifier losses will\nbe addressed in Section VIII), the power provided by the excita-\ntion source, , and the power entering the transformer primary\n2388 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 22, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2007\nFig. 3. Equivalent circuits for operation at the resonant frequency during\n(a) M1 and (b) M2.\nwinding, , are both approximately equal to the output power,\ngiving\n(4)\nFrom (4), equating and provides an expression for the\ntotal charge transferred through the primary of the transformer\nduring a half cycle, as follows:\n(5)\nNow, equating and in (4), eliminating and\nusing (3), (5), and solving for gives\nwhere (6)\nSince 0, (6) provides a constraint on the minimum per-\nmissible resonant tank gain i.e., 1\/2.\nThe parallel- to series-capacitor ratio, , is defined as\n(7)\nFor convenience, designers of LCC converters often assume\n1 as a good compromise between bandwidth, component\nsizing, electrical stresses and impedance matching. It will be\nshown, however, that the proposed normalization procedure can\nreadily provide performance characteristics of the converter for\nalternative values of , with additional benefits.\nThe voltage across at the start of M1 is equal to the nega-\ntive of the voltage at the end of M2\n(8)\nSubstituting (3), (5) into (8) and solving for at the start of\nM1 then gives\n(9)\nDuring M1, the rectifier is non-conducting and the system\nconsists of a basic series -network, Fig. 3(a). The series and\nparallel capacitances effectively present a series combination,\n, as seen from the perspective of the power devices, where\n(10)\nFrom Fig. 3, the general solution for during mode is\n(11)\nwith the inductor voltage at the start of M1 being given by\n(12)\nSubstituting (9) into (12) and recalling that\nnow gives\n(13)\nFrom Fig. 2(b), it can be seen that 0.

The effective \u201c \u201d therefore changes\nduring each mode. The \u201cenergy profile\u201d in steady-state there-\nfore consists of a dc-value upon which a triangular-type energy\nprofile is imposed. For the analysis presented here, the dc-base-\nline value at the start of M1 is therefore used.\nTo consider the accuracy of the model, at resonance, various\nconverter designs have been generated using (6), (22) to satisfy\nthe specifications given in Table I. The resulting ideal compo-\nnent values, given in Table II, are used for simulating each con-\nverter in SPICE. Also given in Table II are the values of and\nobtained from the simulations, from which it can be seen that\nan excellent correlation between them exists.\nA. Load Dependent Tank Current\nTo maintain high part-load efficiency, it is desirable that the\ntank current reduces as increases. From (6):\n(27)\nSince increases for increasing , doubling results in\nat least a doubling of the r.h.s of (27). Note that with a near\n2390 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 22, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2007\nshort-circuit load, is effectively short-circuited and the res-\nonant frequency is given by the series tank components. Con-\nversely, with an open-circuit output, the rectifier is effectively\ndisconnected and is a function of both and , resulting\nin a higher resonant frequency. Consequently, if the r.h.s of (27)\nis initially large, doubling will result in approximately\ndoubling, thereby requiring operation well above resonance to\nregulate the output voltage. The resulting will therefore be\nmuch larger than necessary. Conversely, if the r.h.s of (27) is\nmade relatively small, for the minimum , providing is\nonly modified slightly with an increase in resistance, will\nremain approximately constant, and operation can remain close\nto resonance. This implies two conditions for good loading per-\nformance. First, should be chosen to be large to provide good\nresonant frequency stability, and secondly, should be chosen\nto be 1\/2 for the maximum load (minimum ). The penalty\nfor this, is that, from (22) a higher value for is required, and\nfrom (26) a larger resonant .\nB. Real Power Transfer by Harmonic Excitation\nFor applications where only very limited changes in load are\nexpected (in some lighting applications, for instance) and a reg-\nulated output voltage is required, it is now shown that it is pos-\nsible to reduce the peak current stresses on the tank compo-\nnents using harmonic power transfer. Considering (14) and (19)\nwhich describe the tank current, the peak can occur in either\nM1 or M2. If the derivative of at the end of M1, is posi-\ntive, i.e., 0, see (17), the peak current occurs in M2.\nConversely, if the gradient is negative, the current has already\npeaked during M1. From (14), (19) the peak current is obtained\nas (28), shown at the bottom of the page.\nFor a particular converter operating at high efficiency at res-\nonance, with a 50% duty cycle, can be assumed sinusoidal,\nand all power supplied to the converter is real. Therefore to a\nfirst approximation the input and output power can be equated\n(29)\nSimple rearrangement leads to being given by\n(30)\nwhere corresponds to the minimum sinusoidal current peak\nthat can be achieved for a given design specification.

Optimum A for peak current reduction versus G .\nFig. 7. Current reduction at optimum A versus G .\non harmonics. Also, from Fig. 5 it can be seen that as is\nvaried, the minimum peak current occurs at a particular value\nof that can be numerically calculated. The result is given in\nFig. 6. The corresponding percentage reduction in peak tank\ncurrent is plotted in Fig. 7.\nAgain, it can be seen that the penalty for reducing the current\nstresses on the tank components is that is small, thereby incur-\nring a large variation in resonant frequency as the load changes,\nand reducing part-load efficiency. This design principle is there-\nfore preferred when load variations are expected to be small.\nC. Impact of Component Value Choice\nFrom (6)\n(32)\nand the required series inductor from (22) can be written\n(33)\nFig. 8. Modes during above resonance operation of a heavily loaded converter:\n(a) voltage waveforms and (b) current waveforms.\nEquating terms in both (32) and (33) provides the\nrelationship\n(34)\nand equating the terms in both (32) and (33) gives\n(35)\nEquations (34) and (35) provide important insight into the im-\npact of component and parameter choices that are available to\nthe designer. It will ultimately be shown that converters with\nsimilar values of and possess similar properties, such\nas their normalized frequency responses. Moreover, it may be\ndesirable to maintain certain favourable properties of a previ-\nously used design, with a new specification of converter. The\nfollowing section therefore demonstrates how one can simply\nchange 1) the minimum load, 2) the overall gain, and 3) the res-\nonant frequency, of an existing design, to accommodate a dif-\nferent application requirement.\nScenario 1\u2014From (34) it can be seen that the converter\u2019s\ncomponent values can be varied while maintaining a specific\nby ensuring that both the l.h.s of (34) and remain con-\nstant. This implies that can, for example, be doubled and\nmaintained providing remains constant, and quadru-\npled. However, in general, this will result in a change of . If\nthis is not desired, maintaining , from (35), requires a con-\nstant product. Doubling and halving is therefore\nnecessary.\nScenario 2\u2014Alternatively, it may be desirable that the overall\nconverter gain be doubled, for instance. The most\nstraightforward method to achieve this is via . While main-\ntaining simply has to be halved. However, since and\nare to remain constant, the resonant tank components must\nbe appropriately selected i.e., from (34) must reduce\nby a factor of 16, generally resulting in a change of resonant\nfrequency. Again, if this is not desirable, maintaining the reso-\nnant frequency, from (35), requires a constant product.\nConsequently, has to be quadrupled and quartered.\nScenario 3\u2014Changing , while maintaining , and ,\nfor a nominal load, is achieved through the appropriate choice\nof tank component values. From (34) and (35) doubling is\nachieved by halving both and . Equation (34) is also useful\nwhen considering the conversion from ideal to preferred compo-\nnent values, since the gain is usually the determining factor in a\nconverter design. From (34) the preferred values can be chosen\n2392 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 22, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2007\nFig. 9.

From Fig. 8, the following expressions can be written,\nwhere are the total times spend in M1, M2, M3,\nrespectively\n(38)\nAlso from Fig. 8, it can be seen that no power transfer from\nthe supply to the load occurs during M2 since no current enters\nthe primary of the transformer.\nDuring M2 all the tank current charges from to\n, then, when (5) is used as a substitution for the total\ncharge is given as\n(39)\nSince the procedure to calculate the mode times for heavy\nloading is similar to that used previously, when the converter\nis operating at resonance, the derivation and mode time expres-\nsions are summarized in Appendix A.\nIV. LIGHTLY LOADED CONVERTER\nThe methodology presented in this section is similar to that\nfor heavy loading. Fig. 10 shows example current and voltage\nFig. 10. Modes of operation of a lightly loaded converter: (a) voltage wave-\nforms and (b) current waveforms.\nwaveforms for operation above resonance under light loading\nconditions. The behavior of the converter can be divided into 6\nmodes (M1, M2 M6).

NORMALIZED FREQUENCY RESPONSE\nDuring steady-state operation, the half-cycle switching pe-\nriod is the sum of the mode times\n(42)\nThe expressions for the mode times given in the Appendices,\nequations and ,\ncan be substituted into (42) to provide the half-cycle solution\nGILBERT et al.: NORMALIZED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 2393\nFig. 11. Equivalent circuits during modes: (a) M1, (b) M2, and (c) M3 for a lightly loaded converter operating above resonance.\nFig. 12. Tank frequency response: (a) magnitude and (b) phase response for\nG = A = 1.\nfor the heavily and lightly loaded cases, respectively. When\nis eliminated from the mode time expressions through the use of\n(15), (20) and (22), the converter frequency response in (42) is\nexplicitly dependent on only four variables viz. .\nEquation (42) can be used to generate a frequency response\nto aid in the design of a converter. For example, a designer may\nchoose to nominally operate at a specific percentage above ,\nwith a given and , the only unknown then being . Once\na particular is obtained, a converter design can be simply\ngenerated from (2), (6), (7), (15), (20), and (22).\nWhile generating a frequency response it is necessary to\nidentify whether the converter is heavily or lightly loaded so\nthat the correct set of equations can be utilized. This is achieved\nthrough analysis of the mode times. At the transition between\nthe two conditions, when the converter is critically loaded,\nheavy loading light loading 0. Equating the\ncharge transfer through the series inductor during either of these\ntwo modes, to zero (A2), (A18), and solving for provides\nthe following inequality for heavy loading operation (note that\nusing mode time expressions (A17), (A39) also leads to the\nsame result, although the calculation is more complex):\n(43)\nHence, if heavy loading is initially assumed, after solving\nfor a given and , if (43) is satisfied then the heavy loading\nassumption is valid. Interestingly, setting 0 in the heavy\nloading condition of (42) and utilizing (22) and (43) to eliminate\nand , respectively, provides an expression relating di-\nrectly to at the critical loading point.\nAs an example of computation overhead, Fig. 12 shows (a)\nthe resonant tank frequency response and (b) phase response,\nfor 1\u2014the results show 50-point curves that were\ncalculated in 2 s on a P4 2.4 GHz, running MATLAB.\nVI. NORMALIZED CONVERTER\u2014OUTPUT REGULATION\nThe behavior of the converter, as a function of the load, is\nnow investigated. For convenience, the applied load, , and\nthe minimum load, , are related by the load scaling factor,\n, as follows:\n(44)\nFrom (6), (22), expressions for and can be obtained by\nvirtue of the resonant tank components remaining unchanged as\nthe load is varied (where are the resonant tank gain and\nresonant frequency, respectively, when the load is at its nominal\nvalue 1 ). From (6)\n(45)\nSimilarly, from (22) and using (45) to eliminate gives\n(46)\nand\nwhere (47)\nSince (47) is dependent only on and , a func-\ntion numerically exists which satisfies the following:\n(48)\nFrom (48), as is varied, the change in , and hence,\n[see (45)] is identical for converters with the same and\nat nominal load. In (42) it was also established that the fre-\nquency response of a converter is fully defined by its and\nhence, as load is varied, for a given and at nominal load,\nthe converter\u2019s normalized frequency response for all values of\nis also fully defined, thereby implying that the normalized\nregulation performance of converters with similar and ,\nare similar. Consequently, assuming high efficiency operation,\nit is not necessary to analyse cases on an individual basis, even\nif respective converters differ in , and .\n2394 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 22, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2007\nFig. 13. (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) provide the regulation performance curves for G = A =1. (a) Peak resonant current normalized to a sinusoid at resonance\n(I^ = I (V =N R )(\u0019G =R )).

For 1\/2 this analogy cannot be used since converters\ncannot be generated with 1\/2 at any load.\nFig. 13 provides the regulation performance curves for\n1 (the 50-point curves are calculated in 2.5s on\na P4 2.4 GHz running MATLAB). Fig. 13(a) is particularly\nuseful when assessing the part load efficiency of converters.\nIdeally, would remain at, or below, unity for all loads,\nsince this corresponds to a sinusoidal current at resonance. In\nthe example provided, when 10 is 7.5 times larger\nthan for a sinusoidal current at resonance, see (30). Therefore,\nimproved part-load efficiency occurs at lower gradients on the\nplot.\nFig. 14 provides an example frequency response for\n1. When generating the frequency response, if is nu-\nmerically calculated for a given , care must be taken since\ntwo solutions are present. From a practical perspective it is nec-\nessary that the gradient of the transfer function remains ve (for\noperation above resonance) over the whole load range, thereby\nensuring that positive feedback at the controller never occurs. In\nthe example considered, operating below 1.01 may result\nin instability. In a practical converter, the effects of parasitics\nmay eliminate this potential problem, or indeed accentuate it.\nConverter operation has been previously described with re-\nspect to being either heavily or lightly loaded, the transition be-\ntween the two being a critical point for analysis. While gener-\nFig. 14. Frequency response showing peak gain occurring above resonance.\nating the frequency response it has been necessary to find an\nexpression for this borderline condition, see (43). In a similar\nmanner, it is now also possible to derive an expression for the\nregulatory behavior of the converter (i.e., maintaining while\nvarying through control of ). If it is assumed that the\nconverter is regulated at , as the load resistance is in-\ncreased operation passes through the critical loading point into\nlight loading. Setting 0 in the heavy loading condition\nGILBERT et al.: NORMALIZED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 2395\nFig. 15.

Fig. 15 provides a\nplot of the resulting expression. From Fig. 15, for instance, it\ncan be seen that when a converter is regulated about its nominal\nresonant tank gain of 1 and 2 can increase by\na factor of 2.7 from its nominal level prior to light loading oc-\ncurring. Also from Fig. 15 it can be seen that for 1, the\nheavy loading condition dominates the characteristic, and that\nlight loading is more prevalent for lower values of and large\n.\nVII. NORMALIZED CONVERTER DESIGN CURVES\nHere, normalized design curves for several values (see\nFig. 16) are presented for the common case 1. From the\ncurves, the converter\u2019s magnitude and phase response can be ob-\ntained, and additionally component values and electrical com-\nponent stresses derived. Finally, a degree of insight into the\nsteady state bandwidth of the converter is also identified. note\nfor each curve.\nTo consider the steady-state regulation of the converter,\nshould be considered as a function of load. The resonant fre-\nquency can then be calculated from (45). Once these parame-\nters are known, Fig. 16(a) allows the necessary value of to\nmaintain output voltage regulation, to be calculated, and subse-\nquently, the associated switching frequency.\nFig. 16(e) provides the peak series inductor current stress.\nThe \u2018low gradient\u2019 asymptote added to the graph provides the\npeak inductor current stress that would be obtained had the cur-\nrent been a sinusoid at resonance, see (30). This is useful when\nconsidering converter efficiency.\nFrom (48) it can be seen that .\nSince at is well defined, can be\nreadily evaluated. Now, if is doubled from the nominal value\n, for example, the converter will vary. The value\nof obtained after this doubling can most easily be found\ngraphically. Fig. 16(g) provides a plot of for 1.\nFig. 16(h) provides the necessary filter capacitance to\nobtain a certain percentage output voltage ripple. During periods\nwhen is charging, the output current is maintained by the\ncharge stored on . Assuming a constant load current implies a\nlinear reduction in output voltage, which can be calculated from\nknowledge of the mode times.\nFrom Fig. 16(a) it can be seen that as increases, the\nnecessary for output voltage regulation is bounded. The\nhighest value of occurs during light loading, when is\nhigh. Finding the limit of (42) for light loading, as\nand solving for gives the following:\n(49)\nAs the load tends to open circuit the resonant frequency tends\nto\n(50)\nEquations (49) and (50) can therefore be used to calculate\nthe theoretical maximum steady-state control bandwidth to reg-\nulate the converter from nominal load to open circuit. The peak\nswitching frequency required to regulate the converter tank gain\nat occurs at when the load re-\nsistance is assumed infinite. If 1\/2, which is the usual case,\nthen the minimum switching frequency required to regulate the\nconverter output voltage occurs at resonance when the load is at\nits nominal load. Solving (6) for and substituting this into\n(22) provides an product. Substituting this product into\nthe expression for and dividing by provides a measure\nof the steady-state control bandwidth dependent on at the\nnominal load and only. Fig. 17 provides a measure of\nthe steady-state bandwidth (maximum frequency\/minimum fre-\nquency) as is varied, for several values ranging from 0.2\nto 2 in steps of 0.2. Note that for 1 the maximum value is\n1.8.\nVIII. DESIGN EXAMPLE WITH EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe use of the design curves in Fig. 16 will now be demon-\nstrated by example. A converter specification is given in\nTable III, from where it can be seen that the specification\nincludes rectifier on-state voltages that can be modelled by\nparasitic load resistors, effectively making the overall load\nresistance appear larger. The overall gain is therefore reduced\ndue to the potential divider network that is then present. The\nfollowing expressions can be used to compensate for the recti-\nfier voltage drop: (where \u2019 and \u2019 are the required effective\nload resistance and tank gain to achieve the specifications)\n(51)\n(52)\nFor simplicity the design process can be subdivided into con-\nvenient steps:\n \n2396 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 22, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2007\nFig. 16. Design curves for A = 1: (a) magnitude response, (b) phase response, (c) required parallel capacitor, (d) required inductor, (e) resonant inductor peak\ncurrent, (f) peak series capacitor voltage stress, (g) resonant tank gain calculation curve, (h) required filter capacitor.

When the converter is operated at\nthe peak output power, 1.2 A, giving, from\ndatasheets 0.9 V. For use with the design\ncurves, from (51) and (52), the minimum load and\ntank gain are therefore 16.5 0.55,\nrespectively.\nStep 2) Select a transformer turns ratio\u2014From (6) it was\ndemonstrated that 1\/2. It can therefore be\nshown that providing 0.5\na converter design exists meeting the specifications.\nTo ensure that the converter operates above reso-\nnance at the desired output voltage, the converter\nshall be designed for a maximum output voltage (at\nresonance) of 22 V ( 20% larger than required). A\nminimum value of is therefore 0.75. However, for\ncost and volume reduction, the converter is not con-\nsidered to include a transformer, and therefore, for\ncalculation purposes, it is assumed that 1.\nStep 3) Calculate the required \u2014From Fig. 16(b), the\nfirst curve that meets the specification corresponds\nto 0.65, as highlighted (0.65 2\n21.6 V), and the phase shift is approximately 30\nabove resonance. Also, from Fig. 15(a) 1.07.\nTo ensure that the nominal gain occurs at the spec-\nified switching frequency, the resonant frequency is\nchosen to be 93.5 kHz.\nGILBERT et al.: NORMALIZED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 2397\nStep 4) Calculate ideal resonant tank components\u2014From\nFig. 16(c)\u2013(d), the normalized parallel capacitor and\nseries inductor are found to be 0.075 and 2.5 , re-\nspectively, corresponding to actual values of 48.6 nF\nand 70.6 H.\nStep 5) Utilize preferred components\u2014To obtain preferred\nvalues, while maintaining , component values\nshould be chosen to maintain and constant\n(see (34)). If 47 nF and 68 H, the\nrequirement is satisfied. The new resonant frequency\nmust now be calculated. From (35), since and\nhave remained constant, the resonant frequency\nwill increase by a factor of 1.036 to 96.9 kHz. The\nswitching frequency will therefore have to be also\nincreased to 103.6 kHz.\nStep 6) Filter capacitor selection\u2014Finally, from Fig. 16(h)\nthe normalized filter capacitor required to limit the\noutput voltage ripple to 10% is 0.15, corresponding\nto 10 F.\nStep 7) Electrical stresses at \u2014From Fig. 16(e), (f)\nan indication of electrical component stresses can\nbe found. The normalized peak inductor current and\npeak series capacitor voltage, are 1.1 and 2.25, re-\nspectively, corresponding to actual values of 2.4 A\nand 81 V.\nStep 8) Upper switching frequency estimate\u2014From\nFig. 16(g) an estimate of the switching frequency\nto maintain the output voltage for the minimum\nload (90 ) can be obtained. An increase from\n15 to 90 gives bounds for i.e., 1\nto 6. When 0.65, Fig. 16(g) gives\na value of 0.45. Since the load increases\nby a factor of 6 the resonant tank gain needs to\nbe found which gives a value of 2.7,\nwhich corresponds to 1.6. From (45) the\n\u201cnew\u201d resonant frequency is a factor of 1.22 higher\nthan that at nominal load, giving 118.2 kHz. Now,\nfrom Fig. 16(a), extrapolating from the highlighted\n1.5 curve, for 1.6 1.22 and\nfrom Fig. 16(b) the phase shift is approximately\n73 . The \u201cnew\u201d switching frequency is therefore\n144.2 kHz. Of note in this case is that if the \u201cnew\u201d\nswitching frequency exceeds the specification, from\nFig. 17, given 1, the value of needs to be\nincreased for regulation. In this case it is prudent to\nincorporate a transformer to increase the effective\nturns ratio. Additionally, if it is desired to vary\nwhile maintaining and , from Fig. 17 a larger\nachieves the same effect. However a new set of\ndesign curves for the alternative is required.\nStep 9) Component stresses at maximum load resistance\u2014\nThe normalized peak current stress is 3.2 and nor-\nmalized peak series capacitor voltage is 0.75, cor-\nresponding to 1.2 A and 27 V, respectively. Note\nthat the 90 load is scaled to compensate for the\nrectifier diode losses using (52) to give 99 . From\nFig. 16(h) the normalized filter capacitance is now\napproximately 0.27, giving a peak-to-peak output\nvoltage ripple of 42 mV.\nFig. 17. Maximum bandwidth versus G for various A.\nTABLE III\nCONVERTER SPECIFICATIONS\nTABLE IV\nEXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS VERSUS THEORETICAL ESTIMATES\nTo verify the design procedure experimentally, a converter\nwas built with the calculated preferred component values. Re-\nsults from experiments are summarized in Table IV, from where\nit can be seen that a high degree of correlation exists between\nthe experimental and theoretical performance characteristics ob-\ntained from the analysis results and design procedure.\nIX. USING HARMONICS TO TRANSFER POWER\nThe possibility to transfer real power on harmonics, at the res-\nonant frequency, has been discussed in Section II-B to provide\na mechanism for reducing peak current stresses. Here, similar\ncurves to those presented in Section VII (see Fig. 13, the Tradi-\ntional design), are given for an and that produce a current\nreduction at resonance (the Harmonic power transfer design).\nRegulation performance can then be determined. Component\nstress and regulation curves have been generated for a converter\n \n2398 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 22, NO. 6, NOVEMBER 2007\nFig. 18. (a), (b), (c), and (d) provide the regulation performance\ncurves for a converter with A = 0.1 and G = 0.55 at nominal\nload. (a) Peak resonant current normalized to a sinusoid at resonance\n(I^ = I (V =N R )(\u0019G =R )). (b) Peak series capacitor voltage\nstress (V^ = V V ). (c) Regulation switching frequency normalized\nto nominal load (f = f f ). (d) Phase shift required for output regulation.\nwith 0.1 and 0.55, (the Harmonic power transfer\ndesign), in Fig. 18.\nOf note, from Fig. 18(a), is that a reduction in the normalized\npeak current occurs as is increased indicating that the tank\ncurrent wave-shape is becoming increasingly \u201csquare\u201d as load\nresistance is increased. Comparing the peak normalized se-\nries-inductor current in Fig. 13(a) with that in Fig. 18(a), it can\nbe seen that the Harmonic power transfer design has 9% lower\nnormalized peak current at nominal load 22%\nlower at 1.2 and 37% lower at\n2 with respect to the Traditional design. This implies\nthat the Harmonic power transfer design will have improved\npart-load efficiency (over the load range 1 2). An\nalternative strategy would be to design a converter such that\nthe nominal load occurs at the minimum normalized current,\nthereby reducing stresses and further improving efficiency.\nFurthermore, by comparing the series capacitor stresses, from\nFigs. 13(a) and 18(a), it can be seen that the voltage is ap-\nproximately 70% lower at nominal load in theHarmonic power\ntransfer converter design. From Fig. 18(a) it can be seen that\nat 2, the normalized current 1 hence the harmonics\nare no longer able to compensate for the reduced power factor.\nThe stress reduction at this load is therefore mainly due to the\nmuch closer phase angle between switching voltage and series\ninductor current (23 ) compared with theTraditional design\n(53 ), see Figs. 18(d) and 13(e), respectively.\nTo verify the normalized stress reduction using an ideal\nSPICE model, the two designs were generated around the\ninput\/output and minimum load specifications provided in\nTable III. For theTraditional design where 1 and\n1, the ideal components required are 2 91.6 H,\n42.4 nF and the Harmonic power transfer design\nTABLE V\nSPICE SIMULATION STRESS COMPARISON BETWEEN HARMONIC\nPOWER TRANSFER AND TRADITIONAL CONVERTER DESIGN\nTABLE VI\nHARMONIC CONTENT OF HARMONIC POWER TRANSFER\nCONVERTER DESIGN AT VARIOUS LOADS\nwhere 0.1 and 0.55 the components required are\n1.1 25.5 H, 142.2 nF and 14.22 nF.\nIt can be seen that the data in Table V closely matches that\npredicted from the normalized analysis.\nTo show the ability of harmonics to carry power, Table VI\nprovides the harmonic content when the output is regulated at\n1 and 1.2 for the \u201cnew\u201d converter design, along with\nthe proportion of power transferred to the load. In particular, it\ncan be seen that for the 22.5 case, the third harmonic trans-\nfers approximately 3% of the total output power, although, im-\nportantly, this corresponds to an effective reduction in the peak\nelectrical stresses incurred due to , of 10%.\nA consequence of reducing the electrical stresses, however,\nis that the switching bandwidth required to provide regulation\nover the whole load range, increases. Specifically, theTra-\nditional converter required only 20% increase in resonant\nfrequency to maintain the gain, whereas the Harmonic power\ntransfer converter design requires 90% increase in frequency\nover the same range. This again indicates that utilizing har-\nmonics to carry power is more suited to applications were the\nload is expected to have limited variability.\nX. CONCLUSION\nNormalized behavior of the LCC voltage-output converter\ncharacteristics, in terms of tank gain at resonance and the par-\nallel capacitor to series capacitor ratio, has been presented. De-\nsign curves are derived that consider component value selection\nand related performance, including electrical stresses, switching\nfrequency, phase shift, and tank gain at resonance, as the load\nis increased proportionally from the nominal load and the con-\nverter gain regulated at its nominal level. The design curves\ndemonstrate that the entire behavior of the converter can be de-\npicted graphically. Key features of paper are:\n\u2022 an accurate relationship between the tank gain at resonance\nand the resonant frequency as the load is varied;\nGILBERT et al.: NORMALIZED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 2399\n\u2022 an alternative -factor expression based on energy stored\nin the resonant tank, and power dissipated in the load;\n\u2022 examples demonstrating how to simply alter overall con-\nverter gain and switching frequency while maintaining the\ntank gain at resonance.\n\u2022 expressions giving the maximum theoretical switching\nbandwidth to regulate the converter gain from nominal\nload to open circuit;\n\u2022 an investigation into how the choice of nominal resonant\ntank gain and capacitor ratio affects part load efficiency.\nThe resulting methodology clearly defines the boundary\nbetween heavy and light loading conditions, in terms of nor-\nmalized switching frequency or normalized load, and is ideally\nsuited for use in a graphical user interface where design curves\ncould form a basis for a constrained converter optimization.\nThe underlying analysis has also identified operating regions\nwhere harmonics can transfer real power, thereby reducing\npeak current and component stresses. A design example is pro-\nvided and results compared with experimental measurements\non a prototype converter that demonstrate a high degree of\ncorrelation between theoretical and experimental performance\ncharacteristics. The design example also demonstrates how\nto select preferred component values and how the effects of\nrectifier voltage drop can be included in the design procedure.\nFinally, it should be noted that although the analysis equations\nare derived for a bipolar input voltage, ultimately, the results are\nequally applicable to converters considered to have a unipolar\ninput.\nAPPENDIX\nA.
