This paper analyses approaches to \nethical trade in the South African wine industry through a case study of the Wine and \nAgricultural Ethical Trade Association. It examines factors influencing WIETA, \nincluding the legacies of colonialism and apartheid, its relationship with post-\napartheid restructuring and legislation, and the role of international retailers. \nWIETA\u2019s impact within the wine industry, stakeholder perceptions, and \nimprovements in on-farm standards are explored. The paper illustrates how these \nimpacts are mediated by political and economic factors operating at various scales, \nand by the contradictions of improving working conditions within free market \nglobalisation. Within these broader contexts, it argues that expectations of WIETA are \nunrealistic and its role in transformation widely misunderstood. Instead, ethical trade \ninitiatives need to be understood within their spatial, institutional, and historical \ncontexts so as not to overestimate and undervalue their contribution to socio-\neconomic transformation.  \n \nIntroduction \nAlthough there is no consensus on the definition of ethical trade, the term is used \nfrequently to refer to the sourcing of products from producers guaranteeing core \nlabour and human rights standards to their workforce. It is a site of struggle, \nparticularly within capitalist food production and exchange, between retailers and an \nethical trade movement aimed at mitigating the costs imposed on workers.\n1\n Research \n 3 \nsince the mid-1990s has focused on its driving forces, its organization through multi-\nstakeholder approaches, and its impacts on workers in the South.\n2\n However, there has \nbeen little analysis of how approaches to ethical trade develop in specific ways in \nparticular national-institutional and historical contexts,\n3\n particularly at the producer \nend of supply chains. There have also been numerous calls for empirical research that \ncritically interrogates the social and economic consequences of ethical initiatives \ninvolving supply chains.\n4\n In response, this paper examines approaches to ethical trade \nin the South African wine industry, focusing specifically on the impacts of the Wine \nand Agricultural Ethical Trade Association (WIETA)\n5\n and local stakeholder \nassessments of these. It explores how these impacts have been shaped by \ninternational, national and local contexts: the legacies of colonialism and apartheid, \npost-apartheid restructuring and legislation, and the role of international retailers.  \n \nThe paper draws on fieldwork conducted in the UK and Western Cape in 2006.\n6\n UK-\nbased interviews were conducted with a corporate social responsibility manager at a \nmajor retailer, three NGO and two corporate charity representatives involved in \nethical trading initiatives, and an ethical produce importer\/supermarket supplier. \nTwenty-four formal individual and group interviews were conducted with institutional \nactors involved in South African agri-industries. Of these nine are directly involved in \nthe management of WIETA, six are wine-grape producers, three represent other \nprivate sector interests, three are involved in union management and four represent \nNGOs.\n7\n Informal discussions were held with farm workers at a union-sponsored \ntraining event in Stellenbosch.\n8\n Detailed case study material was collected on both \nproducer experiences and WIETA\u2019s operations, including the dynamics of its \ninstitutional evolution and stakeholder perceptions of its effectiveness.\n9\n Informal \n 4 \ninterviews were also held with representatives from NGOs, unions and the private \nsector.  \n \nThe paper first outlines the broader context in which WIETA was formed and now \noperates, before examining its penetration and recognition within the industry, \nattitudes of different stakeholders, and improvements in on-farm standards. At the \ntime of the research, WIETA had been conducting inspections for 18 months. \nAlthough too early to give a full assessment of its impact, these provide an insight \ninto its potential for bringing about change. Understanding how multi-scalar contexts \nshape and constrain transformation is critical in assessing WIETA\u2019s impact and to \ndeveloping new approaches to ethical trade initiatives. Thus, the paper explores the \nways in which WIETA\u2019s impacts are mediated by political and economic factors \noperating at local, national and global scales, and the complexities and contradictions \nof trying to improve working conditions within free market globalisation. It also \nassesses the dangers of overestimating its potential contribution to socio-economic \ntransformation and undervaluing its actual achievements, which has broader \nimplications for understanding ethical trade in relation to socio-economic justice.  \n \nWIETA and transformation  \nThe history of the South African wine industry is deeply intertwined with the social \nhistory of slavery that continued to shape political, economic and cultural power \nrelations for more than 150 years.\n10\n The wine industry was infamous for the \u2018worst \nworking conditions\u2019 in apartheid South Africa.11 Recent years have seen wholesale \nrestructuring (Ponte and Ewert, 2007),\n12\n but the paternalistic, authoritarian and \nracialised labour regime that was inherited from slavery persists; employment patterns \n 5 \nremain highly racialised and reports continue to reveal high levels of exploitation \nincluding low wages, poor working conditions, an absence of black people in \nmanagerial and ownership positions, and discrimination against women.\n13\n Despite \nlegislation (e.g. the 2003 Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) Act), \ntransformation in the wine industry still lags far behind other sectors.\n14\n \nGroundbreaking initiatives are required to tackle long-entrenched socio-economic, \npolitical and cultural legacies.  \n \nWithin this challenging context, WIETA \u2013 a not-for-profit, voluntary organisation \u2013\nwas formed in 2002. It originated as a UK government Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI) \npilot project in 1999 and operates via a tripartite alliance comprising corporations, \nNGOs and trade unions. Despite the history of bitter antagonism between these \nstakeholders, the pilot was pivotal in bringing them together for the first time, and \nsuccessfully assisted South African partners in developing and refining inspection \nmethodologies for monitoring on-farm labour standards. It was so successful that \nlocal actors devised a home grown model \u2013 the first of its type in the world. Thus \nWIETA sets the parameters for implementing and auditing ethical labour practices \nand working conditions in the Winelands. It has drawn praise from human rights \ngroups and has been described by one ETI representative as the \u2018jewel in the crown\u2019 \nof ETI worldwide initiatives.\n15\n  \n \nThe wine industry encapsulates the scale of the challenge of transformation facing \nSouth Africa. Post-apartheid governments have inherited a dual mandate: a political \nand moral imperative to dismantle extreme, racially delineated socio-economic \ndisparities, and an economic imperative to reconstitute links with the international \n 6 \neconomy in order to stimulate economic growth and employment. Disciplined \nadherence to neoliberal orthodoxy has failed to establish a significant foothold within \nthe highly competitive and asymmetric global economy.\n16\n Land-based production \nactivities, in particular, have struggled to compete within a more open trade regime. In \nthis context, debates about the role of alternative trade in transforming the lives of the \npoor are of significance. While the challenging macro-economic context hardly \nrepresents a fruitful environment in which to effect progressive socio-economic \ntransformation, the wine industry has been pro-active in establishing an institutional \nmatrix to meet these challenges. Numerous organisations have been created and \ninitiatives are taking place at farm level. However, the scope of these ventures has \nbeen limited. WIETA\u2019s role in initiating and driving momentum for change is, \ntherefore, significant.  \n \nSocial auditing  \nWIETA is managed through an executive committee comprising individuals \nrepresenting different interest groups, including the export promotions agency Wines \nof South Africa (WOSA), organised labour, NGOs and the Department of Labour. It \nestablished a code of good practice based on the ETI base code and South African \nlegislation.\n17\n Key principles include: no child labour; freely chosen employment; the \nright to a healthy and safe working environment; the right to freedom of association; \nnon-excessive working hours; the right to a living wage; prohibition of unfair \ndiscrimination; rights to worker\u2019s housing and tenure security. This is monitored \nthrough a social auditing inspection process, and complemented by efforts to educate \nproducers and workers about the content of the code and its practical implementation. \n 7 \nThe imperative is to establish a dynamic upward trajectory of improvement in social \nconditions on farms rather than to \u2018fail\u2019 or shame producers.  \n \nWIETA represents key sector stakeholders, including NGOs, trade unions, growers, \nprocessors, packers, retailers and government. Wine-grape growers who are WIETA \nmembers pay a registration fee and perform self-assessments of their compliance with \nthe code. WIETA reports on the self-assessment and then audits each grower. A pre-\naudit gathers information about the company (number of employees, gender\/racial \nclassifications, hectarage, output). The audit begins with a joint management-\nemployee briefing followed by interviews with managers and workers, inspections of \nworkers\u2019 contracts, visual inspection of housing, and review of health and safety \nmeasures. Workers are selected randomly for private interviews so that they are not \nprepped. A second meeting provides an assessment of levels of compliance and \nfacilitates discussion between management and workers, highlighting both good and \nbad practice and providing an opportunity for opinions to be voiced. The producer is \nprovided with a full report and required to produce an action plan to address areas of \nnon-compliance. The WIETA multi-stakeholder elected committee assesses whether \nthe plan fully addresses areas of non-compliance and, subsequently, whether there is \nenough evidence for accreditation, which lasts three years.\n18\n \n \nWIETA currently has 199 members of whom 103 are wine producers, including \nmajor co-operatives (KWV, Distell, Vinfruco, Western Wines) and individual farms \nand estates.\n19\n Audits began in early 2004 and, to date, 33 producer members have \nbeen accredited (see Table 1). Given that there are around 4,400 grape producers in \nSouth Africa,\n20\n this represents a modest impact. Moreover, it appears that recruitment \n 8 \nfrom the wine sector has stalled. WIETA has struggled to identify a conclusive \nbusiness-case or rationale to encourage membership, attempting to recruit on the basis \nthat better governance on farms and other sites will improve productivity, but \nproducing little hard evidence in support. In addition, while retailers have been \nsupportive there is little evidence of changes in procurement practices.  \n \nTable 1 near here \n \nRecently, however, WIETA expanded into fruit and flower production, largely at the \nbehest of UK retailers (Tesco, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer), which could provide \nsignificant impetus within the wine sector. 191 audits of fruit farms have been \nconducted since the start of 2003 (116 in the 2006\/7 season). However, unlike fruit \nand flowers, the wine industry has a complicated supply chain that involves growers, \ncellars, co-operatives, bottling operations, packhouses and export marketing \ncompanies; there is thus comparatively less reputational risk for retailers. As one \nWIETA executive explains, supermarkets are \u2018very hard and prescriptive on their own \nlabel fruit, less so with wine\u2019 (interview 14\/09\/06); they rarely produce own-label \nwines and do not perceive it their business if suppliers are not compliant. Despite this, \nexpansion into horticulture is viewed optimistically by wine industry representatives \nwho predict that WIETA will grow, \u2018have more teeth\u2019 (ibid.) and greater energy and \nfinance. In the medium term its status is enhanced:  \n \nIf WIETA is doing a good job for Tesco and Waitrose then others will start \nfalling into line. It\u2019s a virtuous circle \u2013 WIETA will get more knowledge and \n 9 \nexperience, with more audits practice will get better. (CEO non-profit wine \nindustry association, 21\/09\/06) \n \nDuring 2007, WIETA launched an education training programme for workers and \nmanagement at production sites, linked into a national qualification system (WIETA \nexecutive, 01\/09\/06). It is also developing a training course for supervisors in the \nagricultural sector, which aims to educate them in the WIETA codes and build \nsupervisory skills, ultimately to improve workers\u2019 experiences.21  \n \nThe role of UK retailers \nUK retailers were instrumental in WIETA\u2019s emergence. South Africa currently \nexports almost 50% of its wine production, over one third of which is exported to the \nUK, its largest single market.\n22\n High levels of retailer buy-in were achieved during the \nETI pilot, particularly from supermarkets. WIETA\u2019s extension into a locally-managed \nassociation has been strongly supported by these supermarkets, who contribute \nheavily to WIETA funding by donating their share of the EU Common Customs \nTariff rebate back to the wine industry. Retailers play a direct role in demanding that \nbasic material quality is met by suppliers,\n23\n which includes social and environmental \ncertification and, increasingly, WIETA membership. This results in tiny margins for \nproducers, strict logistics inducing cost-cutting and \u2018efficiency gains\u2019, and delisting \nfor non-compliance. Yet, while some in the industry perceive accreditation as one \nway of \u2018standing out\u2019 in a crowded marketplace, WIETA has also experienced \ndifficulties in recruiting members. Indeed, it has faced resistance and often hostility \nfrom some producers who feel they are being unfairly singled out for criticism by \ninternational observers (Nelson et al., 2002; Bek et al., 2007).\n24\n Membership is seen \n 10 \nas important only when it is linked to securing an export contract with UK retailers. \nThe costs of achieving compliance are high, sites are rarely compliant after the initial \naudit, and implementing corrective actions can be expensive (one producer reported \ncosts of R200-250,000 (\u00a314-19,000\/$29-36,000)).For retailers, codes of conduct are a \nnecessary business protocol offering a relatively inexpensive measure to protect \ncorporate reputations. Ensuring that suppliers meet acceptable standards is simpler if \nmanaged through a single organisation. Thus, some observers believe that retailers \nmay seek to source all South African wines from WIETA members. \n \nStakeholder perceptions of WIETA  \nIn terms of the efficacy of its inspection processes, WIETA is generally held in very \nhigh regard by the majority of stakeholders. Audits are seen to be of a high standard, \ncomprising good methodology with broad coverage of social and health and safety \nissues. This contrasts with commercial audits, which are considered much more \nvariable and lacking in transparency. Some are tick box exercises, according to a \nWIETA executive \u2018two hours including tea and a chat with producer\u2019 (interview \n01\/09\/06). Another WIETA representative suggests that some retailers organise their \nown audits and, although they use some \u2018high calibre individuals who know the \nprocess and have the skills\u2019, they very often \u2018don\u2019t know the local environment and \nthey come with a westernised mind set\u2019 (interview, 14\/09\/06). In contrast to this \n\u2018window dressing\u2019 (ibid.), WIETA methodology is evidence driven, based on \ndialogue and representation at various levels, including casual workers, which \nprovides a comprehensive picture of the organisation. As a CEO of a wine industry \nmarketing association argues, \u2018WIETA has done really well, operating in a difficult \nenvironment [and] has produced material that is very reputable (interview 21\/09\/06). \n 11 \n \nMany respondents highlight the importance of WIETA in providing a platform for \nenabling diverse stakeholders to work together. Consequently, there has been greater \ncommunication between different interest groups, with better mutual understanding of \nperspectives. The fact that WIETA is a local rather than international auditing body, \naware of the profound historical and contemporary sensitivities in the Western Cape, \nis clearly of significance: \n \nWIETAS\u2019s dynamics \u2013 stakeholder interaction \u2013 was very difficult at the \nbeginning. But now look at board meetings. There is more trust and mutual \nrespect\u2026 There is this South African thing of treating each thing in minutiae, \nto give everyone a say. WIETA people have been fantastic at dealing with \nthat. Endless patience. They are great at keeping people informed and \ninvolved in decision-making. Things work better. (Ibid.) \n \nSeveral respondents point out that WIETA is subject to a great deal of politicking \nfrom different stakeholder groups and stress the importance of its independence from \nindustry structures. In addition, unlike other audits, WIETA inspections are conducted \nin local languages. This is important given that many farmers produce for a co-\noperative, never have contact with exporters and retailers, and for whom an external \naudit can feel like \u2018a case of two different worlds meeting\u2019 (WIETA representative, \n14\/09\/06). Positive results are much more likely if the farmer feels comfortable and is \nable to communicate in Afrikaans. \n \n 12 \nProducers are largely positive about WIETA. However, in a context where it is widely \nsuggested that around fifty percent are struggling financially, the requirements and \ncosts of compliance are often seen as particularly burdensome. One producer observes \nthat WIETA compliant sites tend to be \u2018larger and financially secure\u2019 and thus are \nbetter able to \u2018commit human and financial resources to the issues at hand\u2019 (interview \n14\/09\/06). Another argues that many farmers run their businesses in the traditional \nway \u2018off the back of an envelope\u2019 (interview 07\/09\/06); the sophistication of modern \ncompliance systems is often beyond such producers and they lack the resources to \ncope. WIETA requires recorded evidence in the form of documentation, but small \nfarmers claim to have neither time nor infrastructure for record-keeping. The fact that \nWIETA standards are broader and higher in some regards than legislative \nrequirements is a contentious issue about which some producers and other \nstakeholders complain.  \n \nSome producers stress the importance of WIETA in raising awareness of new \nlegislation and the extent of non-compliance on their farms, since even progressive \nproducers lack familiarity with the detail of much health and safety and labour law. \nOne producer representative in Stellenbosch recounted his surprise at the audit \nfindings: \n \nWe were audited for the first time in September 2004\u2026 After the initial audit \nwe were provided with a report that thick [indicates with both hands] that was \nstructured around the labour law codes and the H&S codes. We were okay on \nthe labour but were big-time non-compliant on the H&S stuff\u2026 Without \nWIETA we would never have had a clue about many of the problems that \n 13 \nwere identified\u2026 It really opened our eyes to H&S issues. (Interview \n19\/09\/06) \n \nIn addition to raising awareness and attending to areas of non-compliance, producers \nalso referred to the significance of accreditation in terms of the export market and, \nspecifically, in countering the tainted image of exploitation and poor working \nconditions within the South African wine industry: \n \n[Accreditation] is not so important for the local market... But it is important \nfor overseas, especially UK, markets. We can show that we have been \ninspected by a reputable third party. We can show that we are not the \noppressor of old. Here it is in black and white, done an audit, fixed the \nproblems and here\u2019s the proof. We are an ethical producer. If we get some \nextra mileage, an extra sale here and there then that is an added bonus. \n(Producer interview, 23\/09\/06) \n \nPerceptions of WIETA\u2019s impacts on labour conditions on farms and in broader \nprocesses of transformation within the industry are mixed and vary between \nstakeholder groups. The slow pace of transformation has been highlighted in previous \nstudies and this remains a prevalent issue.\n25\n There is still a lack of worker awareness \nof the codes.\n26\n However, there is considerable optimism amongst those involved in \nindustry organisations and other transformation bodies: \n \nPerception of labour standards on South African wine farms is certainly better \nthan ten years ago. You don\u2019t see the dop system;27 we are now dealing with \n 14 \nthe legacy of its history. I believe that the industry is committed to making \ndifferences in people\u2019s lives. On most farms you find that people are paid \nminimum wage and some people do have security of tenure. (Wine company \nCEO, former WIETA board member, 22\/09\/06) \n \nThe strategic plan is working well \u2013 moving from just being an auditor to \nbeing a promulgator of best practice is very exciting. WIETA\u2019s standards are \nabove the law \u2013 and we have good laws. WIETA tackles more complex issues \nthat the law cannot tackle \u2013 the nuances of sexual harassment, workers \nrunning up tabs at farm shops that equate to all their salaries\u2026 The big \nsuccess story has been to tackle labour brokers. Some are exceptionally \nexploitative. (Marketing association CEO, 21\/09\/06) \n \nIn contrast, workers and worker organisations express frustration regarding WIETA\u2019s \nimpact on transformation, with \u2018WIETA lacks teeth\u2019 a common complaint. Other \nstakeholders suggest that this miscomprehends WIETA\u2019s role: \n \nAt the last AGM we had a march by trade unions\u2026 WIETA has no actual \npower. They want WIETA to be more assertive and aggressive. This is partly \nabout their own frustrations, if truth be told, because the degree to which \nunions have penetrated is very small. They are very fragmented. We have seen \na lot of disillusion on farms. People do not quite understand the role of \nWIETA. They want WIETA to do their job for them. (Marketing association \nCEO, 21\/09\/06) \n \n 15 \nMany respondents within the industry are aware that WIETA is not an enforcement \nagency and is largely market driven, but expectations among workers are often higher \nthan WIETA\u2019s remit. Thus, understanding WIETA role in the context of debates \nabout transformation and empowerment is important in assessing its actual and \npotential impact within the wine industry. \n \nWIETA\u2019s role in transformation  \nThe problems with transformation (or lack of) in the wine industry are well \ndocumented.\n28\n Rather than improving farm worker organization and the nature of the \nlabour regime on farms, critics argue that commitment to worker interests through \nBEE is couched in self-amelioration discourse (education and training) and \ncodification technologies that shift the terrain of restructuring from a political to a \nmanagerial realm. This process is buttressed by branding, advertising and image-\nbuilding on the one hand, and by codes of conduct, scorecards and auditing on the \nother. Critics argue that rather than effecting change this is likely to become another \ntool in \u2018allowing both the standardization and the de-racialisation of labour and social \nrelations in the wine industry\u2019.29 The danger for WIETA is that it becomes conflated \nwith BEE and thus subject to similar critiques; any assessment of WIETA\u2019s impact \nthus needs to be within the framework of its remit. \n \nIt is still very early in WIETA\u2019s history to draw definitive conclusions about its \nimpacts on farms. WIETA has been an independent organisation for only four years, \nand it takes more than a year between audit and accreditation. While a recent ETI \nImpact Assessment of the South African fruit sector reveals that base codes are \nhaving limited impact, WIETA was identified as having potential \u2018to provide a \n 16 \nvehicle for the implementation of labour codes\u2019.30 WIETA is working in a difficult \ncontext in which problematic trends prevail in rural areas \u2013 decreasing numbers of \npermanent employees, whose working and social conditions are on the whole \nimproving, and a growing proportion of casualised workers who bear the brunt of \nproducers\u2019 desires to keep down costs through flexibilisation (Ewert and du Toit, \n2005).\n31\n Despite these difficulties, WIETA sets the bar on labour standards and \ngenerates levels of aspiration within agri-industries. As discussed, where inspections \nhave taken place they have proved to be educational for producers, especially in the \narea of health and safety. Audits enable data on compliance issues to be aggregated \nand disseminated so that a picture of standards in the wine industry can be drawn and \nsupport for corrective measures generated by the relevant agencies. \n \nImproving working conditions \nIt will take time for WIETA to gather momentum, particularly considering the \nenormous structural shifts required, and its impacts on labour standards across the \nindustry are at present low. In April 2005, WIETA published the results of the first \ncomplete year of social auditing during which 42 producer sites were inspected.\n32\n The \naudits confirmed that the industry is male-dominated and employing a largely \n\u2018coloured\u201933 workforce. Men have access to the most skilled (e.g. cellar work) and \nsecure jobs. Both \u2018coloured\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 women are more likely to be \ntemporary\/seasonal workers than their male counterparts. Sites that are part of large \ncorporate companies are more likely to experience unionisation than their \ncounterparts. However, unionisation levels are very low and producers often prohibit \nunions. Significantly, the global ETI report notes that high levels of unionisation \ncorrelate with high levels of compliance with the ETI base code.\n34\n Workers on wine \n 17 \nfarms continue to report that working conditions are generally poor and difficult, and \nabuse of workers persists (Breytenbach, 2006).\n35\n While there have been some \nimprovements, it is a slow process. As a representative of women\u2019s labour union, \nSokhile Sonke, argues, there are wide variations in conditions. Two neighbouring \nfarms in Ceres supplying the same supermarket reveal vastly different working \nconditions: WIETA accredited farms paying good salaries and benefits alongside \n\u2018Tesco farms with poor wages and no benefits\u2019 (interview 19\/09\/06). In some cases \npermanent workers enjoy \u2018quite reasonable conditions with cr\u00e8ches, contributions to \nmedical costs, pension contributions and so forth\u2019, but the \u2018trend of casualisation is \ncausing huge problems\u2019 (ibid.).  \n \nWIETA audits found that labour brokers are used at two-thirds of sites inspected. \nLarge corporate groups are more likely than independent producers to use brokers. \nAudit performance declines down the supply chain. Compliance with child labour and \nminimum wage is 100%, but there is no indication as to whether this also applies to \ncasual workers employed via brokers. The worst performance area relates to control \nover standards for employees taken on via labour brokers (45% non-compliance). The \naudits raise a number of specific areas of concern: measures taken to accommodate \npregnant and nursing women workers (39% non-compliance); rights to a contract \n(60%); records kept of employment, including contractor\/seasonal contracts (25%); \nall workers (including seasonal) are trained in basic Occupational Health and Safety \n(55%); workers are not abused verbally or intimidated (25%); clean toilets are \navailable to all workers (33%); young workers earn at least the legal minimum hourly \nrate (38%).\n36\n \n \n 18 \nGiven that the more progressive farms have been the first to seek WIETA \naccreditation, the audits confirm that there is still a long way to go before the industry \nadequately meets basic standards of employment. However, one important area in \nwhich WIETA is making progress is with labour brokers: \n \n1.7 million people have been evicted from farms in the last 20 years (5% \nlegally). 3 million have been displaced via retrenchments. including spouses \nand children... Most of those workers ended up working in gangs and the \ncomposition has changed with many African women. We have invited labour \nbrokers to join WIETA and six have. In cases where we are inspecting users of \nlabour brokers, we do endeavour to inspect the labour broker elements. \nWIETA are looking at issuing a model contract between employers and labour \nbrokers, including stipulations about daily pay rates, duty specifications and so \nforth. (WIETA executive, 01\/09\/06) \n \nWhile farmers may respond to failures by changing brokers, the cause of such failures \nis often the low payment the farmer makes and, unless rates increase, it is unlikely \nthat much will change. However, following WIETA inspections, members have taken \nsteps to rectify problems experienced by seasonal workers engaged through brokers, \nsince many of the latter are not complying with their legal obligations. Where \npossible, WIETA requires brokers to be audited alongside the main employer to \nreduce costs. Where this is not possible, WIETA audits the labour broker operation \nseparately during the season when temporary workers are hired. Brokers supplying \nemployees to the wine industry are also able to join WIETA and gain accreditation in \ntheir own right. Some WIETA members are requiring their brokers to join and this \n 19 \nappears to be an increasing trend. Another achievement has been to make owners and \nproducers aware of conditions that can be detrimental to the health, safety and labour \nrights of their workers. For example, many winery owners were unaware that using \ncertain filtration media can cause silicosis and were inadvertently putting their cellar \nworkers at risk. Preventative measures are being taken at WIETA audited sites. In \nother cases, housing for temporary cellar workers has been improved.  \n \nMost respondents agree that working conditions on farms have improved to some \ndegree. Some suggest markedly, others are more cautious. Some point to the highly \ndifferential experiences of different groups of workers, with casualisation producing \nsignificant gender and race divisions. Some permanent workers have little awareness \nof the realities for casual workers, claiming that \u2018they get free transport\u2019 and \u2018they \nhave no deductions\u2019 (informal worker interviews, Stellenbosch 22\/11\/06). Casual \nworkers have no deductions at source for housing and other benefits because they are \nexcluded from such benefits. Farm workers also report that restrictions on unions \nremain a major obstacle. Workers who recruit or join are threatened with dismissal \nand organisers are prohibited on farms. Some farms are allegedly erecting electronic \ngates to keep unions out. However, progressive labour laws and the WIETA code \n\u2018give unions something to work with\u2019 (ibid.). Enforcement is clearly a problem, but at \nleast unions are able to use the legislation to hold some people to account. Unions are \nthus keen for WIETA to improve conditions and to offer support to progressive \nfarmers. \n \nWIETA\u2019s impact on effecting change on farms might appear to be relatively minor if \nviewed in isolation from other developments. However, it is also part of networked \n 20 \nactivism, which connects trade unions, grassroots movements, NGOs, producers, \ngovernment departments, legislative bodies and international retailers, and the \npossibilities for future transformation appear promising. Tesco\u2019s encouragement of \nWIETA\u2019s expansion into fruit production is indicative of this, since the impetus arose \nout of activism by Women on Farms Project (WFP), Sikhula Sonke and ActionAid. \nTesco claims never to source items produced under unethical conditions. However, \nWFP and ActionAid produced two damning reports highlighting worker rights \nviolations in the Cape (Wijeratna, 2005; Brown-Luthango, 2006; WFP, 2006).\n37\n \nFollowing a well-publicised shareholder revolt at its AGM, Tesco approached \nWIETA to undertake pilot audits and develop auditing methodology for the fruit \nindustry. \u2018Since then, the major Tesco-supplying fruit companies\u2026, have all agreed, \nalbeit reluctantly, to be audited through WIETA\u2019.38 The audits were completed by the \nend of the 2007 harvesting season.  \n \nEmpowerment \nWIETA is perceived as promoting ethical trade and improved working and living \nconditions for employees through a holistic and considered facilitation of best labour \npractice. What it is able to deliver in tangible terms in relation to empowerment (and \nthe specific understanding of empowerment as BEE) is a subject of intense debate. \nOne wine industry advisor argues that WIETA can only do so much and, rather than \nbeing a vehicle for transformation, is merely a starting point; it is the responsibility of \npeople within the industry to effect a deeper transformation in line with BEE \nlegislation (interview 22\/11\/06). WIETA works with other bodies, such as the South \nAfrican Wine Industry Council. This was created during 2006 to deliver the Wine \nIndustry BEE Charter adopted on 30\nth\n July 2007 and is representative of all \n 21 \nstakeholders in the industry. The Charter aims to, \u2018open paths of opportunity for those \npreviously excluded under apartheid; and to provide a decent way of life and human \ndignity to those who work on the wine farms\u2019.39 However, critics of BEE point out \nthat it allows a conservative agenda to be embedded in official frameworks such as \nthe Charter and the technical monitoring tools associated with it.\n40\n As discussed \npreviously, such processes embed socio-economic concerns in standards, codes of \nconduct and certification schemes, which in turn shifts the nature of the debate about \ntransformation from the political to the technical. Unless structural, racial and power \nimbalances are addressed before the shift occurs, transformation is likely to remain \ntechnical and apolitical.\n41\n  \n \nBEE thus provides a conservative context in which WIETA cannot be expected to \ndeliver empowerment. However, this should not lead to undervaluing its role in \nimproving working conditions on farms and providing opportunities for other \norganisations working with more radical empowerment agendas to effect change. For \nexample, newly formed unions, like Sokhile Sonke, are beginning to work more \nclosely with WIETA in driving change on farms. WIETA has been particularly keen \nto support redistribution of wealth, provided this is done in such a way that has \npositive impacts on the livelihoods of the poorest and most disadvantaged in the \nsector. It is sensitive to criticisms of BEE that it has merely enriched a black middle \nclass and reinforced the position of poorer people (WIETA representative, 15\/09\/06), \nand is aware of the need to resist this in BEE deals within the wine sector. It promotes \nthe idea amongst industry stakeholders that social auditing outcomes should be taken \ninto account in BEE assessments, in order to enhance the \u2018broad-based\u2019 empowerment \nnow required by legislation.  \n 22 \nSignificantly, micro enterprises (those with turnover below R5 million), are exempt \nfrom the 2003 BEE legislation. Within the wine industry, based on estimated turnover \nand available statistics, approximately 80% of farms are exempt from the provisions \nof the Charter.\n42\n Without a legislative requirement to adopt BEE codes, therefore, \nmarket-driven transformation based in ethical trade is likely to remain important in \ndriving change within the industry. WIETA is unlikely to play a direct role in \naddressing many of the main challenges facing BEE, such as the highly skewed \nownership regime, advancing women in the industry, mobilising knowledge, business \nacumen, capital and social capital, and rural development and poverty alleviation. As \none respondent suggests: \u2018we can meet the [WIETA] standards and life will still be \nhell for most people\u2019 (Head of Wine Co-Operative, 31\/08\/06). However, WIETA is \ncontributing towards the establishment of a new tone in the industry, particularly \nabout basic employment rights and conditions.\n43\n  \nWIETA also plays a role in addressing issues prioritized in BEE legislation, such as \nimproving labour relations and fostering human dignity, improving security of tenure \nand employment, creating an economically viable transformation and an integrated \nvalue chain. The WIETA code goes beyond labour laws in promoting joint \nworker\/management participation in implementation, and worker education on \nemployment standards and codes. By joining WIETA, producers can take steps to \ninstitutionalise compliance with legal standards as an integral part of their business. In \nother words, they are embracing the spirit of the laws rather than just the letter \nthrough a participative and developmental approach to sustainable employment \npractices in line with legislation. Significantly, the WIETA code is a social code, \nmonitored by social auditing under local stakeholder auspices. Unlike other codes, it \n 23 \nis not monitored using technical appraisal without local stakeholder oversight and is \nthus more able to address the social development outcomes of employment.  \nThe challenge of transformation: constraints and opportunities \nVoluntary processes, such as those encouraged by WIETA and the Wine Industry \nCharter, are likely to meet significant obstacles since they lack \u2018a big stick to beat \nproducers into compliance\u2019 (WIETA representative, 15\/09\/06). Prevailing power \nrelations within the industry present major constraints. At a local level the entrenched, \ninstitutionalised conservatism of the \u2018wine industry complex\u2019 \u2013 the white elite that \ncontinues to run the major businesses and organisations \u2013 is a significant barrier to \nchange.\n44\n It is renowned for circumnavigating legislation and voluntary initiatives in \norder to maintain the status quo. As discussed, the shift to outsourcing on the labour-\nintensive farms of the Western Cape represents another large obstacle to improving \nworking conditions: \n \nAn increasing reliance of third party [labour] brokers has effectively enabled \nfarmers to wash their hands of accountability for the conditions under which \nharvesting teams laboured. It also ensured that significant portions of the \nlabour force worked essentially outside the realm of effective regulation.\n45\n \n \nInterviews also reveal serious issues relating to eviction of workers. In some areas, \nactivist claim that worker houses are increasingly being turned into student \naccommodation and tourist cottages (WFP representative, 30\/08\/06).  \n \nAnother set of constraints operate at the international scale. The relatively strong \nRand (until very recently)\n46\n and global oversupply of wines for export provides a \n 24 \ntough context for transformation and upliftment processes. UK-based retailers use \nsourcing policies that place considerable downward cost pressures on suppliers, who \nalso have to meet the costs of compliance with ethical codes. Scope for investing in \nthe needs of workers thus tends to be limited. WIETA\u2019s existence is dependent upon \nUK retailers, yet these do not (yet) provide sufficient pressure on wine producers to \nbe compliant. Some are more active than others, but there is still doubt concerning \ncommitment:  \n \nWe don\u2019t know whether the supermarkets in the UK see it [WIETA] as \nimportant enough\u2026 I certainly don\u2019t see that. If I want to sell to Tesco I don\u2019t \nsee an imperative to use WIETA policies. I don\u2019t know how important the \nSouth African industry is to the supermarkets\u2026 and I\u2019m not sure how \ncommitted the supermarkets are to the WIETA code. It is an ethical code that \nmeans nothing if it does not have the leverage from the supermarkets to ensure \nit is applied. That is problematic and unless the supermarkets start showing \ntheir teeth more in terms of supporting WIETA it will be a long and arduous \nroad. (Ibid.) \n \nThere is a sense within the wine industry that retailers tend to be more concerned \nabout WIETA auditing their own brand products due to the direct link between brand \nand site of production, and the larger margins they make on these products. There is \nalso a sense that ethics within corporations are driven by key individuals within CSR \ndepartments rather than being engrained within firm governance. As the head of a \nmajor wine co-operative explains: \n \n 25 \nWIETA\u2019s standards are similar to normal commercial ones but they focus \nmuch more on the social\/labour standards side, which is important. WIETA is \nhelpful when dealing with Tesco who are keen to push the dirty work onto \nsuppliers. Supermarkets are profit driven. They want to be seen as clean when \nthey are not clean. They could do a lot more to co-operate with those trying to \nimprove supply chain practices. They divorce themselves from responsibility. \nThey ought to get involved in supply chains rather than putting it onto audit \nfirms. They could use their Foundations to do good work. They have delegated \nthat responsibility and passed it on to WIETA, Fairtrade and the likes of \nOxfam. The reality is that they do use standards and yet the poverty is still \nthere. They squeeze suppliers. (Interview 31\/08\/06) \n \nHowever, this pattern of retailer domination is not perceived as insurmountable: \u2018the \nconsumer can end it for them. Tesco have been engaging \u2013 the pressure from WFP \nhas been important. This helped in putting these issues on the agenda\u2019 (ibid.).  \n \nWaitrose, which invests in WIETA through its Foundation (WF), receives positive \nendorsement. The parent company (John Lewis) is mutually-owned and independence \nfrom the short term demands of shareholders provides scope for innovation and \ninvestment in alternative models. WF raises a levy from each component of the \nsupply chain for all South African sourced fruit. The levies are invested into social \nprojects at farm level. WF assists with processing funds and determining the projects \nupon which money can be spent. This is seen as \u2018a more community-focused system \nthan other ethical and fair trade models\u2019 (WIETA executive, 01\/09\/06). WIETA is \nlikely to be involved in inspecting suppliers to ensure compliance and, in contrast to \n 26 \nthe industry norm, WF pays for the audits instead of the suppliers. Waitrose tends to \nbuild enduring relationships with suppliers: \u2018They are not as \u2018flexible\u2019 as Tesco\u2019 \n(ibid.). It also has a relatively small producer base, which allows it to operate its \nmodel effectively: \u2018larger retailers would find it very difficult to administer such a \nsystem\u2019 (ibid). Several respondents felt that WF represented a potential paradigm shift \nin corporate approaches.  \n \nOn the production side, there is increasing frustration with the \u2018lack of meaningful \nmargins in exports to UK supermarkets, the need for massive promotion budgets and \nthe recent flattening if not decline of South African wines\u2019.47 This prompted WOSA \nto organize a panel at Cape Wine 2006 entitled \u2018Why bother with the UK?\u2019 with \njournalists launching scathing attacks on UK supermarkets for \u2018squeezing out the life \nin wine\u2019.48 Other observers are more positive, particularly about Tesco expanding its \nfine wine portfolio, which would significantly aid South African producers enter a \nmarket that delivers much higher margins. Meanwhile, WIETA is building its \nbusiness case in ways that might reduce reliance on UK supermarkets. For example, it \nis preparing a two-year plan for Sweden\u2019s sole wine importer (WIETA executive, \n01\/09\/06), which has a reputation for providing good margins. Sweden is looking to \nimport wines that are ethical, good quality and meeting social criteria, and has asked \nWIETA to design a proposal to organise the social auditing. This signals a growing \napproval of WIETA\u2019s stakeholder model. However, UK supermarkets still need to \nstrengthen their commitment to ethical trading and restrict their oligopolistically-\nderived capacities to force down prices to the detriment of workers.\n49\n This, alongside \nstate support for greater international competitiveness, pro-poor policies, the building \nof social capital and equity, is seen as key to driving change in the industry. \n 27 \n \nConclusions \nWIETA is mandated to improve working conditions yet, given the scale of change \nrequired to effect meaningful transformation in the South African wine industry, \ndemands and expectations are much higher. This is particularly apparent among \nlabour unions, which often perceive it as a surrogate for the (significantly under-\nresourced) Department of Labour, and among industry observers. This exposes \nWIETA to similar criticisms to those levelled at ethical trade more broadly: that it is \nlikely to have limited impact on the lives and livelihoods of farm workers, that it is \nunable to address the most pressing problems, such as trends towards casualisation \nand externalisation, and that by reducing issues to ethical sourcing it does not \nchallenge retailers to address the broader ways in which they create inequitable power \nrelations in trade networks.\n50\n Thus, WIETA has effectively been granted a poisoned \nchalice. Its concerns are with the base code and, increasingly, with training workers, \nmanagers and supervisors in ethical trade. It is difficult to see how this would help in \ntackling the worst abuses on farms. However, there is a degree of irritation within the \nethical wine sector with those who seek to rush to judge WIETA, particularly with \nauthors of critical reports based on only the first few months of audits. In addition, \nthere is a tendency to overestimate WIETA\u2019s potential contribution to socio-economic \ntransformation and to undervalue its actual achievements. It is essential, therefore, to \nunderstand the complex historical and scalar contexts within which WIETA operates \nto more fairly assess its actual and potential role in socio-economic transformation. \nSuch an approach has broader implications for evaluating ethical trade initiatives.  \n \n 28 \nIn policy terms, WIETA illustrates the importance of transparency within auditing \nprocesses through which retailer guarantees of labour standards\/working \nenvironments are articulated, and the significance of the role of government in \nenforcing labour standards through legislation. Ironically, the extension of basic \nhuman and socio-economic rights to farm workers has coincided with increased levels \nof casualisation and externalization, primarily because of increased costs of labour \nand meeting the requirements of labour legislation, as well as retailer pressure on \nmargins. In this context, WIETA is not intended as a vehicle for radical change in the \nwine industry, nor can it be in the conservative context of transformation in which it is \npositioned. Instead, it needs to be understood as part of a \u2018repackaging of \nethical\/equity\/race concerns that takes place in the wine industry through technologies \nof self-governance\u2019.51 These mechanisms (codes of conduct, standards, \ncertification\/auditing, labelling, accreditation systems) might be criticised as the \nimplementing arm of \u2018stakeholder\u2019 capitalism.52 However, most wine farms a not \nsubject to BEE legislation and, in the absence of strong rural labour organisations, \nWIETA fills a void in effecting incremental improvements in working conditions. \nCritics might attack the lack of radical, structural change, but such criticisms arguably \nhave little to offer those who still work in poor and exploitative conditions. A marker \nof WIETA\u2019s longer term success will be in whether the improvements it secures fulfil \nthe aspirations of farm workers. Basic improvements are already evident and WIETA \nis now focused on ensuring that its codes do not overlook the needs of casual workers. \n \nWhile progressive elements in the wine industry are committed to improving \nstandards and working conditions, WIETA is positioned within a broader set of local \nand international contexts that places limitations on its potential impact. A key issue is \n 29 \nwhether it is possible for ethical labour practices to be implemented in the context of \nenormous downward pressures on labour conditions.\n53\n Critical attention should \nremain squarely on power relations (between supermarkets and cellars; between \ncellars and farmers; between farmers and workers). Although WIETA does not \nexplicitly problematise and politicise these power relations, it does at least make them \nvisible. It may fall well short of transformative notions of economic justice by \nfocusing on labour conditions, but at least it reveals how poor these labour conditions \nremain. Criticisms are inevitable and should play a positive role in developing \nWIETA\u2019s methodologies as long as the organisation is open to critical engagement, \nand critique does not turn to cynicism that undermines it. While WIETA cannot \nfundamentally alter power relations within the South African wine industry, or within \nglobal supply networks, it could bring significant benefits for workers whose lives are \noften wretched. In normalising the concept of decent working conditions, WIETA \nthus has the potential to play an important role in transforming the wine industry. As \nwith other ethical trade initiatives, it might be considered an important stepping stone \nto longer-term, more substantive transformation. \n \nWIETA\u2019s role as a local initiative is also significant, blending the ETI code with \nSouth African labour laws and adapting normative parameters to local contexts. \nUnlike some ethical trade initiatives, WIETA relies on high levels of stakeholder \ninvolvement and is not driven by decision-making from North to South. It is still part \nof an ethical complex that is, to some extent, governed by the corporate strategies and \nmanagement systems of retailers, which might blunt its \u2018ethical force\u2019.54 Indicators of \nachievement will, to some extent, reflect the values and concerns of Northern retailers \nand consumers because of their significance in the wine industry.\n55\n However, these \n 30 \nalso encompass the aspirations of South African workers. By demonstrating its \ncapacity and ability to define its own ethical goals, WIETA thus has the potential to \nillustrate what might be achieved when Northern retailers, civil society organisations \nand consumers relinquish some of their control over the ethical trade movement.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe owe a debt of thanks to our respondents in the Western Cape, who gave of their \ntime freely and without whom the research would not have been possible.
