These data suggest that infection can\ndirectly alter the processing of a transmembranal protein intimately linked to the aetiology of AD.\nBackground\nThe key events which initiate Alzheimer's disease (AD)\nremain unclear, though environmental factors have been\nshown to be involved [1]. The two main neuropathologi-\ncal features of AD \u2013 senile plaques (SP) and neurofibril-\nlary tangles \u2013 occur also in the normal elderly. AD may be\ntriggered when the numbers of these features increase to\nabnormal levels. Although there is much evidence sup-\nporting the involvement of one or both of these structures\nin the disease process, it is unclear whether they are\ninvolved directly, what processes underlie their forma-\ntion, and why their numbers rise during the development\nPublished: 18 August 2005\nBMC Microbiology 2005, 5:48 doi:10.1186\/1471-2180-5-48\nReceived: 09 May 2005\nAccepted: 18 August 2005\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/5\/48\n\u00a9 2005 Shipley et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2005, 5:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/5\/48of AD. However, any environmental stimulus capable of\nleading to production of the abnormal proteins which\nmake up these structures might thereby contribute to the\noccurrence of AD.\n\u03b2-amyloid protein (A\u03b2) is the major proteinaceous com-\nponent of senile plaques, and the abnormal deposition of\naggregates of this protein is thought to give rise to SP for-\nmation. A\u03b2 comprises a sequence of 39\u201343 amino acids\nand is formed by cleavage from the much longer amyloid\nprecursor protein (APP), first by \u03b2-secretase then by \u03b3-\nsecretase. Generation of A\u03b2 may lead eventually to the\ndevelopment of neurotoxic SPs, which themselves cause\nfurther tissue damage and SP generation, or alternatively\nto the production of small neurotoxic A\u03b2 assemblies,\nwhich may be the most damaging form of A\u03b2 [2]. What-\never the mechanism leading to neuronal damage after A\u03b2\ngeneration, any agent which interferes with amyloid sys-\ntems may thereby contribute to the development of AD.\nStudies of the possible role of pathogens in AD were made\npossible in the early 1990s by the development of PCR,\nallowing detection of low levels of viral or bacterial DNA\nwithin human brain tissues. However very few investiga-\ntors have undertaken such studies, and most work has\nfocused on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). A causal\nrole for this virus in triggering AD was suggested by\nItzhaki et al., who found that the risk of developing AD\nassociated with carriage of an APOE-\u03b54 allele depends on\nthe presence of latent HSV1 in the brain [3,4]. Coupled\nwith the finding here of a higher APOE-\u03b54 allele frequency\namongst individuals who suffer damage after HSV1 reac-\ntivation in the periphery \u2013 seen as cold sores \u2013 this indi-\nrectly supports a role for HSV1, perhaps acting with other\npathogens [5], as a key environmental contributor to AD\n[3,4].\nRecent epidemiological studies support the involvement\nof a pathogen in AD: cognitive function in AD patients\ndeclines for at least 2 months after a systemic infection\n[6]; cognitive decline in elderly cardiovascular patients\ncorrelates with viral burden [7]. These could be explained\nby systemic infection causing brain inflammation which,\nin turn, leads to reactivation of latent HSV1 \u2013 and conse-\nquent further damage in the CNS. Consistently, in mid-\ndle-aged controls, very few of whom would harbour HSV1\nin brain [8], no cognitive decline occurs after systemic\ninfection [9]. Enhancement of damage in brain, due to the\npresence of an infectious agent, is supported by the find-\ning that inflammation in brain caused by lipopolysaccha-\nride is augmented in pre-clinical prion-infected mice [10].\nOne mechanism by which HSV1 might contribute to AD\nwas suggested by the detection of a sequence homology\nbetween A\u03b2 and the HSV1 glycoprotein B (gB), a viral coat\nprotein which is involved in attachment of the virus to\ncells, and by the finding that synthetic peptides derived\nfrom gB can give rise to A\u03b2-like aggregates. The authors\nsuggested that such viral proteins might act as a seed for\namyloid plaque formation [11]. Another way in which\ninfection might affect amyloid biochemistry is suggested\nby studies demonstrating that A\u03b2 or APP are upregulated\nin response to a wide range of injurious stimuli, including\nhead injury [12], stroke [13] or HIV infection [14].\nIncreased expression of APP \u2013 though not of the related\nprotein amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) \u2013 has\nbeen reported in cutaneous wound repair [15]. APP foci\ncolocalise with sites of opportunistic infection in HIV\ndementia patients, including sites of herpes virus\n(cytomegalovirus) infection [16]. Another type of APP-\nHSV1 interaction has been demonstrated in axonal trans-\nport: APP was found to be present in HSV1 particles and\nit was suggested that this could lead to alterations in loca-\ntion and processing of APP at the nerve terminal [17]\ncausing synaptic and neuronal dysfunction.\nNo studies have been made on HSV1 effects on APP or A\u03b2\nin cells in culture. Here we describe the first to investigate\nwhether levels of APP and its metabolites are affected by\nHSV1 infection, using human neuronal-type cells in\nculture.\nResults and discussion\nWe carried out initial experiments on SHSY5Y cells to\ndetermine the level of HSV1 needed to ensure that on\ninoculation most cells were infected. We then examined\nlevels of APP in lysates prepared from the cells 6 h after\ninfection with this dose of HSV1. Western blots stained\nwith anti C-terminal APP antibody (Fig. 1A) revealed, as\nexpected, various full-length APP bands in uninfected\ncells corresponding to the three main isoforms in multiple\nglycosylation states. Deglycosylation experiments have\nshown that the lower single band (100 kDa) is immature\nAPP695, that the doublet above this (approx molecular\nweight 115 kDa) is mature APP695 and immature\nAPP751\/APP770 and that the highest molecular weight\ngroup (approx. 125 to 135 kDa) comprises a mixture of\nmature APP751 and mature APP770 (Parkin et al., unpub-\nlished observations).\nThe intensity of these bands decreased appreciably in cells\nharvested only 3 h after inoculation with HSV1, as did\nthose from cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibi-\ntor cycloheximide. This decline after infection may reflect\nloss of ability of the cells to generate new APP due simply\nto virus-induced shut-down of protein synthesis [18].\nOf particular interest was the relative intensity of a 55 kDa\nband, again apparent after C-terminal APP antibody stain-\ning. This band was similarly intense in control-treated andPage 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2005, 5:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/5\/48Effect of HSV1 infection on APP processing in SHSY5Y cellsFigure 1\nEffect of HSV1 infection on APP processing in SHSY5Y cells.

Band intensity for cells treated for 6\nhours was quantified using Syngene Genetools software\nand averaged over five such experiments is shown in Fig-\nure 1B; value for HSV1-infected cells was significantly dif-\nferent from control, being elevated by 124% (95%CI 101\n\u2013 148%; p < 0.002), whereas that for cycloheximide-\ntreated cells was similar to the control value.\nTo exclude the possibility that the band reflected synthesis\nof a viral protein which cross-reacts non-specifically with\nthe antibody, we immunostained blots produced from\ngels of viral proteins from our HSV1 preparations. No evi-\ndence for any cross-reaction of the Sigma C-terminal APP\nantibody with these proteins could be found, suggesting\nthat the strengthened band was cell-derived (results not\nshown). This result does not preclude any cross-reactivity\nwith an ICP, as the latter would not be present within vir-\nions, but the presence of the 55 kDa protein in uninfected\ncells, and also, at a higher level, in APP-transfected cells\n(see below), strongly supports a cellular, non-viral origin\nof the protein. Interestingly, APP has been detected in\nHSV1 virions by Western blotting [17], but this probably\nreflects the authors' usage of a much more concentrated\nand purified virus preparation than that of the inoculate\nwe use for infecting cells.\nWe next examined the influence of duration of infection\non these viral-induced changes (Fig. 1C). As anticipated,\nwith increasing duration before harvesting, the depletion\nof APP became more pronounced (this was found also\nwith cycloheximide treatment); in contrast, the intensity\nof the C-terminal 55 kDa fragment seen in the infected\ncells was not higher than in uninfected cells at 3 hr, but\nincreased at 6 hr and 9 hr. However there was minimal\nfurther change as incubation increased to 24 hr (not\nshown). This result also was found to be reproducible on\nrepeating the experiment several times from infection to\nblotting. It suggests that infection prevents synthesis of\nAPP, leading to its gradual depletion, but causes also the\nabnormal accumulation of the 55 kDa fragment due, pre-\nsumably, to a decrease in degradation of the latter. How-\never, for longer incubation times, we cannot exclude the\npossibility of sequestration of some APP within newly\nsynthesised viral particles, as reported elsewhere [17],\nwhich might reduce the amount of APP in the virus-free\ncell lysates used for the preparation of cell proteins.\nWe repeated these experiments with herpes simplex virus\ntype 2 (HSV2), to see whether these effects were specific to\nHSV1. Fig. 2 shows that very similar findings were\nobtained, with 55 kDa band intensity for HSV2-infected\ncells 9 hr after infection being 101% greater than that for\ncontrol cells (95%CI 94 \u2013 107%; p < 0.005) suggesting\nthat this phenomenon is not uniquely associated with\nHSV1 infection.\nOn the assumption that a corresponding N-terminal frag-\nment of approximately similar size to that of the 55 kDa\nC-terminal fragment would be produced as a result of this\nabnormal processing (the size of APP being 110 kDa to\n135 kDa), we probed our blots with the Sigma N-terminal\nantibody (Fig 3A). However we found no clear evidence\nfor an increased amount of an N-terminal fragment of\naround this size after infection. Possibly, such a fragment\nwould be either degraded or released into the cell culture\nmedium, thus precluding its detection here.\nTo confirm further that the C-terminal fragment is derived\nfrom APP (and not for example from an APLP, i.e. of a\ntype of protein related to APP, though with a less clear\ninvolvement in AD) we obtained human SYSY5Y cells\nthat had been transfected with a human APP gene\n(APP695), and which over-express APP. We stained blots\nof proteins from non-transfected, APP transfected, and\nmock-transfected (i.e. with vector alone) cells with the C-\nterminal antibody, and found the 55 kDa band in all three\ncases, though its intensity was greater in the APP trans-\nfected cells alone (see Fig. 3B). This indicates that the 55\nkDa fragment is indeed an APP product.\nEffect of HSV2 infection on APP processing in SHSY5Y cellsFigure 2\nEffect of HSV2 infection on APP processing in \nSHSY5Y cells.

Normal SHSY5Y \nhuman neuroblastoma cells, mock-transfected SHSY5Y cells (mTf) or APP695 transfected cells (APP Tf) were uninfected prior \nto harvest. In addition normal SHSY5Y cells which had been infected with HSV1 (lane labelled HSV1) for 6 h were also pre-\npared, to allow position of the HSV1-senstive 55 kDa band to be clearly identified. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot \nanalysis, and probed with an anti-C-terminal APP antibody (Sigma Aldrich A8717) at 1:4000 dilution. Arrows indicate the posi-\ntion of the band intensified after HSV1 infection. The intensity of full-length APP bands was appreciably greater than those in \nthe non-transfected cells. In addition the intensity of several smaller bands was also greater than the intensity of the same \nbands in the mock-transfected (mTf) or normal SHSY5Y (cont), including a band at the same position as the band intensified on \nHSV1 infection of normal SHSY5Y cells (marked by the arrows), suggested this band is genuinely derived from APP.Page 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2005, 5:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/5\/48Conclusion\nInfection of neuronal cells by HSV1 is known to cause\nrapid shutoff of protein synthesis prior to viral replication\n[19]. This is mediated by the virion host shut-off (vhs)\nprotein, which destabilises cellular mRNAs causing them\nto be degraded. Consequently, and unsurprisingly, tran-\nscription of the gene(s) for APP would cease, as would its\nsynthesis and that of other proteins. Our finding that lev-\nels of full length APP decline rapidly in infected cells and\nin cells treated with cycloheximide, suggest that in both\ncases turnover of full length APP is rapid.\nThe surprising increase in amount of the 55 kDa C-termi-\nnal APP fragment in infected cells shows that processing\nof APP as well as its synthesis is affected by HSV1, that this\noccurs within 6 h of infection, and that the level increases\nwith time after infection up to at least 9 h. The size of this\nfragment and its staining with C-terminal antibody indi-\ncate that it includes the region of APP which contains A\u03b2.\nThe possibility that the 55 kDa band derives from an APLP\nor merely reflects a non-specific reaction of the APP anti-\nbody with a viral protein or ICP is unlikely. Our viral prep-\narations did not cross-react with this antibody, and at the\ntime when this band begins to increase in intensity (6 h)\nthe majority of ICPs would have already appeared. Fur-\nthermore the 55 kDa band is present (at lower levels) in\ncells not infected with virus. Also, cells transfected with\nAPP (though not mock-transfected cells) have a higher\nlevel of this 55 kDa fragment than do untransfected unin-\nfected cells.\nThe fact that the mock-transfected and cycloheximide-\ntreated cells do not show any intensification of the 55 kDa\nband suggests that this phenomenon is not due merely to\na non-specific stress response, but occurs in response to\ninfection, although the increase in the fragment after\nHSV2 infection shows the effect is not specific for HSV1\ninfection alone. Interestingly, infection of human brain\nmicrovascular endothelial cells with Chlamydia pneumonia\n(Cpn) may increase the intensity of a similar 55 kDa C-ter-\nminal APP band (personal communication, Professor\nBrian Balin, PA, USA). Thus, increased production of this\nfragment may be a general response to infection.\nCurrently HSV1 is the only virus that has been shown to\nbe present in brain of most elderly humans [20] \u2013 and\nmay be present as a whole functional genome [21]. Active\ninfection of brain cells with other agents might lead to the\nsame APP effects, but until or unless they are shown to be\npresent, they can not be proposed as possible factors in\nAD. The situation regarding presence or absence of the\nbacterium Cpn in brain appears unresolved, although a\ndirect role for Cpn in amyloid systems is supported by\nrecent studies in mice showing amyloid deposition in\nanimals intracerebrally infected with Cpn [22]. Confirma-\ntion of Cpn presence would support the possibility that,\nas with HSV1, the increased level of the 55 kDa fragment\nthat it causes might contribute to AD.\nThe low levels of A\u03b2 secreted by SHSY5Y cells preclude our\nexamining at present the effects of HSV1 infection on lev-\nels of A\u03b2 in cell culture models. Eventual identification of\nthose components of A\u03b2 protein systems which are altered\nby active viral infection will clarify whether pathogens\nsuch as HSV1 can contribute directly to the development\nof AD neuropathology.\nWe report here that levels of full length APP rapidly\ndecline in human neuronal type cells acutely infected with\neither HSV1 or HSV2. Also, the amount of a C-terminal 55\nkDa APP fragment which contains the A\u03b2 sequence\nappears to increase rapidly in infected cells. The fragment\nlevel is greater in (non-virally infected) SHSY5Y cells\ntransfected with APP695, suggesting that it is almost cer-\ntainly derived from APP rather than from APLP. The\nfragment may increase as part of a host defence mecha-\nnism, and\/or it might lead to increased generation of A\u03b2.\nWe are now investigating whether the latter possibility is\ncorrect.\nMethods\nCell culture\nHuman neuroblastoma (SHSY5Y) cells were maintained\nin Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supple-\nmented with 10% (v\/v) foetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% (v\/\nv) glutamine and 1% (v\/v) penicillin\/streptomycin (10%\nmedium), hereafter referred to as growth medium. Cells\nwere incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of\n5% carbon dioxide.\nSHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells over-expressing APP695 were\nprepared by double blunt end ligation of the human\nAPP695 sequence into the BstXI site of pIREShyg (BD Bio-\nsciences Clontech, California, USA). For stable transfec-\ntions 30 \u00b5g of DNA was introduced to cells by\nelectroporation and selection was performed in normal\ngrowth medium containing 100 \u00b5g ml-1 hygromycin B\nselection antibiotic (Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK). 'Mock-\ntransfected' cells were stably transfected with the empty\npIREShyg vector.\nHSV1 (strain SC16) stocks were prepared from a primary\nstock kindly provided by Prof. Roy Jennings (Department\nof Virology, University of Sheffield), using Vero cells as\nhost. Herpes simplex virus type 2 stocks were prepared\nfrom a clinical isolate kindly provided by Prof Anthony\nHart (University of Liverpool) as for HSV1, using HEp2a\ncells. In both cases, confluent cell monolayers were inoc-\nulated at high multiplicities of infection (>10 plaque-Page 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Microbiology 2005, 5:48 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2180\/5\/48forming units (pfu) per cell) with virus suspended in\ngrowth medium containing only 1% FBS. Once cyto-\npathic end point was reached (after about two days) virus\nwas harvested from medium and from cells disrupted by\nlow power sonication. Cellular debris was removed by\nlow speed centrifugation (1000 g, 10 min), and virus was\nisolated by high speed centrifugation of the supernatant\n(10000 g, 2 h, 4\u00b0C) using a Sorvall SS34 rotor. Virus-con-\ntaining pellets were suspended in PBS, and stored in aliq-\nuots at -85\u00b0C; their infectivity was assessed by plaque\nassay of serial dilutions. The virus preparations were\nchecked for bacterial sterility by inoculation into beef\nheart agar plates and confirming the absence of bacterial\ngrowth after incubation for several days at 37\u00b0C. For both\nviruses three sequential passages were prepared, and only\npassage 3 stocks used here.\nSHSY5Y cells were seeded at a concentration of 8 million\ncells per flask (T175) and incubated overnight. Prior to\ninfection, growth medium was discarded and cells were\nthen washed briefly 10 ml of PBS at 37\u00b0C. HSV1 (or in\nsome experiments HSV2) was introduced in 10 ml of\ngrowth medium (containing only 0.5% serum), at 3 pfu\/\ncell. For controls, either 0.5% serum containing growth\nmedium alone or the latter containing cycloheximide at\n10 \u00b5g\/ml was used. After 1 hr incubation, the inoculating\nmedium (or control treatment) was removed, and 10 ml\nof fresh 0.5% serum containing growth medium was\nadded, followed by further incubation for various times.\nProtein extraction and Western blotting\nCells were harvested by removing medium, washing twice\nwith 10 ml PBS, and incubated in 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4)\n(in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min. The cell suspen-\nsion was centrifuged (500 g, 5 min, 4\u00b0C), and the cell pel-\nlet was resuspended in 400 \u00b5l of homogenisation buffer\n(0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS; 2 mM phenylmethylsulphlflu-\noride (PMSF); 100 \u00b5g\/ml of aprotinin and 100 \u00b5g\/ml leu-\npeptin). Cell lysis was completed by sonication (MSE\nsonicator, 4\u00b0C, 10 \u00b5m amplitude, 6 \u00d7 10 s).\nAfter measuring the protein concentration of each lysate\n(BCA protein assay; Pierce), samples were prepared for\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) by mixing 60\n\u00b5g of protein with 0.25 volume of \u00d75 Laemmli sample\nbuffer containing 25% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and boiling\nfor 5 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on\n10% SDS-PAGE gels and the proteins transferred to PVDF\nmembranes (Immobilin-P, Millipore) by Western\nblotting.\nMembranes were blocked for 1 h using 8% skimmed-\npowdered milk in 0.5% Tween in TBS (TBST). The mem-\nbrane was then washed (this and subsequent washes\ninvolved 5 separate 5 min washes in TBS) and then incu-\nbated with primary antibody, diluted 1:4000 with TBS\n(for 1 1\/2 h). Primary antibodies used were anti-C-termi-\nnal APP (Sigma; A8717), and the anti-N-terminal APP\nantibody 22C11. After a further wash, membranes were\nincubated with secondary antibody conjugated with per-\noxidase (Pierce) which had been diluted 1:1250 with 8%\nmilk in TBS for 1 h. After a final wash the membrane was\nincubated with Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent\nSubstrate Kit (Pierce) for 10 min, and proteins were then\nvisualised by chemiluminescence using a gel documenta-\ntion system (Syngene).\nAuthors' contributions\nSJS carried out virology experiments and Western blotting\nstudies, and helped to draft the manuscript.
