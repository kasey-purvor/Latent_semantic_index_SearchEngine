Introduction \nThis article focuses on the Berge equilibrium concept and explores its relevance to \ncooperation in social dilemmas and to the related phenomenon of coordination in common \ninterest games. These are among the most familiar problems in social, political, and economic \nlife, and they are poorly understood, although cooperation, including its evolution and \nmaintenance, is arguably \u201cthe most important unanswered question in evolutionary biology, and \nmore generally in the social sciences\u201d (May, 2006, p. 109). Berge equilibrium can be viewed as \nan implication of the altruistic social value orientation of interdependence theory, just as Nash \nequilibrium is an implication of the individualistic orientation. Berge equilibrium has not \npreviously been explored in the social and behavioral sciences, although it offers potentially \nuseful insights into altruism, cooperation, and coordination. \nA fundamental assumption of classical game theory, and of decision theory in general, is that \ndecision makers are invariably motivated to maximize their individual utilities, relative to their \nknowledge and beliefs at the time of acting. Recent developments in psychological and \nbehavioral game theory have shown that this assumption cannot be true if individual utilities are \ninterpreted narrowly as objective payoff gains or losses, measured in monetary units, for \nexample. Players in strategic games do not invariably try to maximize their individual objective \npayoffs but sometimes appear to be motivated by other-regarding utilities that take account of \nthe payoffs to their co-players. In particular, it is now widely acknowledged that considerations \nof fairness and reciprocity influence strategy choices, and various implications of this have been \nMutual support in games  2   \nexplored by Rabin (1993), Fehr and Schmidt (1999), Bolton and Ockenfels (2000), Arnsperger \nand Varoufakis (2003), and others. \nIn the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game, experimental investigations have provided overwhelming \nevidence that human decision makers do not invariably choose the Nash equilibrium strategies \nthat are mandated by game theory. In the simplest type of Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game, two players \neach choose between a cooperative strategy, providing a benefit b to the co-player at a cost c to \nthe cooperator, and a defecting strategy that entails no benefit or cost to either player. Provided \nthat c < b, this payoff function yields a simple (decomposable) version of the familiar Prisoner\u2019s \nDilemma game. Mutual cooperation results in each player receiving a net payoff of b \u2013 c, and \nthis is preferable to the zero payoff for mutual defection. But both players nevertheless have a \ntemptation to defect, because a unilateral defector receives the best payoff\u2014the benefit b without \nany cost\u2014while a unilateral cooperator receives the worst payoff, paying the cost c without any \nbenefit. (This method of specifying a Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game highlights the fact that \ncooperation can be viewed as mutual altruism, where altruism is defined in the usual way as \nacting to benefit another individual at some cost to oneself.) Defecting is a dominant strategy in \nthe sense that it yields a better payoff irrespective of whether the co-player cooperates or defects, \nand it follows that this is the only rational way to play an unrepeated or one-shot Prisoner\u2019s \nDilemma game. What makes the game a genuine dilemma is the fact that each player receives a \nbetter individual payoff if both cooperate than if both defect. Despite the dominance of the \ndefecting strategy, people cooperate frequently in experimental Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma games and \nin multiplayer versions of the game (Colman, 2003). In the closely related Centipede game, most \nplayers also avoid the (subgame-perfect) Nash equilibrium and behave more cooperatively or \naltruistically, even when very large financial incentives are at stake (Parco, Rapoport, & Stein, \n2002); and in the Ultimatum game, players almost always behave more cooperatively or \naltruistically than is required by the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (Camerer & Thaler, \n1995). \nIn all such games, intuition and experimental evidence strongly favor strategy choices that \ndeviate systematically from those mandated by motivations that are purely selfish in terms of \nobjective payoffs. That decision makers are invariably motivated to maximize their individual \nobjective payoffs is a tacit assumption so deeply embedded in the judgment and decision making \nresearch tradition that researchers sometimes have difficulty even recognizing that they are \nmaking it, but there are circumstances in which even pure altruism seems entirely natural. For a \nhomely example, a doting grandparent playing a board game with a child might be motivated \nsolely to maximize the child\u2019s payoffs in the game and may therefore play to lose\u2014technically, \nplaying the game in mis\u00e8re mode. It is not difficult to think of interactive decisions in which, on \ncommonsense grounds, we should expect both or all players to choose altruistic strategies. As a \nbenchmark example for this article, consider a jazz-loving man married to a classical music \nlover. Suppose that each wishes to choose a musical recording as a wedding anniversary present \nfor the other, knowing that they will inevitably spend many hours listening to the music together. \nHere, we should intuitively expect each spouse to maximize the other\u2019s payoff by choosing the \nother\u2019s favorite type of music. In game-theoretic terms, both players would still be maximizing \ntheir own individual utilities, as required by expected utility theory, but those utilities would be \naltruistic rather than selfish. \nAlthough altruism may be relatively uncommon in everyday life, there is extensive empirical \nevidence that it can be elicited reliably by exposing research participants to certain \ncircumstances, such as the plight of a suffering victim calculated to elicit empathic emotions (see \nMutual support in games  3   \nBatson & Shaw, 1991, for a critical review of many of the classic studies). For example, Batson \nand Ahmad (2001) asked participants to choose second in a one-shot Prisoner Dilemma game, \nknowing that the co-player had already defected. In a treatment condition in which participants \nwere induced to feel empathy for the co-player who had recently suffered a painful relationship \nbreak-up, 45% cooperated, compared to 0% in a control condition. Among the other factors that \nare known to be associated with altruism is reciprocity: in many types of interaction, altruistic \nbehavior is essentially linked to an expectation of reciprocal altruism from the recipient (Brosnan \n& de Waal, 2002; Trivers, 2005). \nAltruistic behavior is well documented in nonhuman species. A familiar example observed in \nmany species of birds is the distinctive alarm call that they emit when they spot predators, such \nas hawks (Maynard Smith, 1965). Alarm calls alert other members of the flock, enabling them to \ntake appropriate evasive action, but such behavior provides no benefit to the alarm-caller itself; \non the contrary, there is persuasive (though indirect) evidence that, by attracting the predator\u2019s \nattention, the alarm-caller actually reduces its own chances of survival (Marler, 1955, 1959). It is \nnow widely acknowledged that alarm calling provides a true example of altruistic behavior in \nnature (Wilson & Evans, 2008). \nInterdependence theory is based on the undeniable premise that the utilities determining \nplayers\u2019 strategy choices in games do not invariably correspond to their objective payoffs (for \nreviews, see Rusbult & Van Lange, 2003; Van Lange, 2000). The motivations of players in two-\nplayer games are described in terms of social value orientations defined by payoff \ntransformations. According to this approach, players\u2019 other-regarding utilities U' are defined as \nfunctions of their own and their co-players\u2019 objective payoffs U. If ui and uj are the objective \npayoffs to Players i and j in a two-player game, and si and sj are strategies chosen by Players i \nand j, then Player i is assumed to maximize a real-valued utility function ( , ) ( , ),i i j i i jU s s f u u\u2032 =  \nand Player i\u2019s social value orientation is a property of the particular function fi. The \nindividualistic orientation is represented by fi = ui, the altruistic orientation by fi = uj, the \ncooperative orientation by fi = ui + uj, the competitive orientation by fi = ui \u2013 uj, and the equality-\nseeking orientation by fi = min {ui \u2013 uj, uj \u2013 ui}. The assumption is that players are invariably \nmotivated to maximize their expected utilities, in any situations in which they find themselves, \nbut that that these expected utilities are not necessarily individualistic\u2014they may be altruistic, \ncooperative, competitive, or equality-seeking, depending on the psychological characteristics of \nthe decision maker and the particular circumstances of the social interaction. We shall show that \nBerge equilibria arise in circumstances in which utility-maximizing players are motivated by the \naltruistic social value orientation. \nThe individualistic social value orientation is the motivation tacitly assumed by decision \ntheory and game theory, and the voluminous literature of orthodox game theory may be viewed \nas an exploration of its theoretical implications. The remainder of this article is devoted to a \npreliminary exploration of Berge equilibrium as a theoretical implication of the altruistic social \nvalue orientation. In Section 2, we formalize Berge equilibrium, examine some examples, derive \nsome basic theoretical results, and propose a new model of cooperation in social dilemmas in \nterms of Berge equilibrium. In Section 3, we show how the Berge equilibrium solves \ncoordination problems in some common interest games and partially explains the payoff \ndominance problem, and we argue that the cooperative social value orientation, in conjunction \nwith the theory of team reasoning, offers a complete solution to these problems. In Section 4 we \nbriefly review the sparse literature on Berge equilibrium and social value orientations. In Section \n5 we draw the threads together and summarize our conclusions. \nMutual support in games  4   \n \n2. Altruism and the Berge equilibrium \nThe Berge equilibrium concept was introduced intuitively by Berge (1957, p. 20) and \nformalized by Zhukovskii (1985) in the context of differential games. Early literature, almost \nexclusively in Russian, focused on differential games. Berge equilibrium was not examined in \nconventional strategic games until recently (Abalo & Kostreva, 2004, 2005), and emerging \nrecognition of other-regarding utilities in psychological and behavioral game theory (Bolton & \nOckenfels, 2000; Fehr & Schmidt, 1999) has imbued it with contemporary relevance. \nWe consider a game1 \n( ) ( ): , , ,i ii N i NG N S U\u2208 \u2208=  \nwhere N = {1, 2, ..., n} is the set of players, Si denotes the strategy set of Player i, and Ui is the \nutility function of Player i. We assume that n \u2265 2 and that each Si is finite and contains at least \ntwo strategies. We write ,ii NS S\u2208=\u220f  and we interpret Ui as a function Ui : S \u2192 \uf052 representing \nthe Player i\u2019s objective payoffs. We call s = (s1, s2, ..., sn) \u2208 S a strategy profile, but we shall also \nbe interested in the incomplete strategy profile \n( )1 2 1 1, , , , , , .i i i n j\nj i\ns s s s s S\u2212 \u2212 +\n\u2260\n= \u2026 \u2026 \u2208\u220fs  \nWe use the natural notation \n( ) ( )1 2 1 1, , , , , , , , .i i i i i i nU s U s s s s s s\u2212 \u2212 += \u2026 \u2026s  \nWe call a strategy profile s* \u2208 S a Berge equilibrium if, writing ( )1 2, , , ns s s\u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217= \u2026s , we have \n ( ) ( ),i i i iU s U\u2212\u2217 \u2217\u2264s s  (1) \nfor all s\u2013i \u2208 S\u2013i and for all i \u2208 N. In other words, if the players have chosen a strategy profile that \nforms a Berge equilibrium, and i sticks to the chosen strategy but some of the other players \nchange their strategies, then i\u2019s payoff will not increase. \nFor Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1950, 1951), we have \n( ) ( ),i i i iU s U\u2217 \u2217\u2212 \u2264s s  \nfor all si \u2208 Si and for all i \u2208 N. A Nash strategy is a best reply to co-players who also play Nash \nstrategies, yielding the best payoff to a player who chooses it, given the strategies chosen by the \nco-player(s), whereas a Berge strategy yields the best payoffs to co-players who also play Berge \nstrategies. The key difference is that, in Nash equilibrium, an individual player\u2019s deviation from \nthe equilibrium can reduce that player\u2019s own payoff whereas, in Berge equilibrium, a deviation \nby one or more co-players can reduce the payoff to a player who does not deviate. \nZhukovskii and Chikrii (1994) specify a further condition. Let us write \n( )max min , ,\ni ii i\ni i i iSs S\nU s\u03b1\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2208\u2208\n=\ns\ns  \nso that \u03b1i is i\u2019s maximin security level, that is, the maximum payoff that i can guarantee to obtain \nregardless of the choices of the other players. Zhukovskii and Chikrii stipulate that \n ( )i iU\u03b1 \u2217\u2264 s  (2) \nfor all i \u2208 N. If a Berge equilibrium strategy profile s* also obeys (2), then we shall call s* a \nBerge\u2013Vaisman equilibrium (for reasons to be explained in Section 4). \nMutual support in games  5   \nIn interdependence theory, the altruistic social value orientation, in which Player i is assumed \nto maximize the utility function ( , ) ( , ) ,i i j i i j jU s s f u u u\u2032 = =  has been defined only for two-player \ngames. Berge equilibrium may reasonably be interpreted as an implication of the altruistic \norientation, generalized to n-player games with otherwise standard game-theoretic assumptions, \nbecause in both cases every player is motivated to maximize the payoff(s) to the other player(s) \nand every player chooses strategies accordingly. \nWe illustrate these ideas by finding a simple sufficient condition for a Berge equilibrium to \nbe a Berge\u2013Vaisman equilibrium. We need the following version of a standard lemma. \n \nLemma 1. With the notation that we have introduced,  \n( ) ( )max  min ,   min  max ,\ni i i ii i i i\ni i i i i is S s SS S\nU s U s\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2208 \u2208\u2208 \u2208\n\u2264\ns s\ns s  \nfor all i \u2208 N. \n \nProof. Fix i \u2208 N. We have \n( ) ( ),   max ,\ni i\ni i i i i iS\nU s U s\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\u2208\n\u2264\nt\ns t  \nfor all si \u2208 Si. It follows that \nmin ( , )  min  max ( , )  min  max ( , )\ni i i i i ii i i i\ni i i i i i i i is S s S t SS S\nU s U s U t\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2208 \u2208 \u2208\u2208 \u2208\n\u2264 =\nt t\ns t t  \nand \nmax  min ( , )  min  max ( , ).\ni i i ii i i i\ni i i i i is S t SS S\nU s U t\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\u2208 \u2208\u2208 \u2208\n\u2264\ns t\ns t  \nSubstituting si for ti and si for ti, we obtain \nmax  min ( , )  min  max ( , ).\ni i i ii i i i\ni i i i i is S s SS S\nU s U s\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2208 \u2208\u2208 \u2208\n\u2264\ns s\ns s           \uf06f \n \nHaving examined \u03b1 as defined in (2), it is natural also to examine \n( )max min , .\ni ii i\ni i i is SS\nU s\u03b2\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\u2208\u2208\n=\ns\ns  \nThe following theorem tells us that, if \u03b1i \u2264 \u03b2i for all i, then a Berge equilibrium is a Berge\u2013\nVaisman equilibrium. \n \nTheorem 1. Suppose that the game discussed above has \n( ) ( )max min , max min ,\ni i i ii i i i\ni i i i i iS s Ss S S\nU s U s\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\u2208 \u2208\u2208 \u2208\n\u2264\ns s\ns s  \nfor all i \u2208 N. Then any Berge equilibrium is a Berge\u2013Vaisman equilibrium. \n \nProof. Suppose that s* is a Berge equilibrium. By definition, \n( ) ( ),i i i iU s U\u2217 \u2217\u2212 \u2264s s  \nfor all s\u2013i \u2208 S\u2013i and all i \u2208 N. It follows that \n( ) ( )max , ,\ni i\ni i i iS\nU s U\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2217\n\u2212\u2208\n\u2217 \u2264\ns\ns s  \nand consequently \n( ) ( )min max , .\ni i i i\ni i i is S S\nU s U\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2217\n\u2208 \u2208\n\u2264\ns\ns s  \nApplying Lemma 1, we obtain \nMutual support in games  6   \n( ) ( )max  min , ,\ni ii i\ni i i iSS\nU s U\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\u2208\n\u2217\n\u2208\n\u2264\nss\ns s  \nor, in more abbreviated notation, \u03b2i \u2264 Ui(s*). If \u03b1i \u2264 \u03b2i for all i \u2208 N, then \u03b1i \u2264 Ui(s*) for all i, and \ntherefore s* is a Berge\u2013Vaisman equilibrium.          \uf06f \n \nIf Player i adopts a Berge strategy, then why should the other altruistically motivated players \nfollow suit by playing their own Berge strategies? Consider a player j who plays a non-Berge \nstrategy sj \u2260 sj*. According to the defining condition (1), we have: \n( ) ( ), , , ,i i i j j i i i j jU s s U s s\u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\u2265s s  \nfor all i \u2208 N and sj \u2260 sj*. By playing a Berge strategy, j maximizes i\u2019s utility and, because this \napplies to every i \u2208 N, j maximizes the utility to all the other players in the game as well. \nFurthermore, by playing Berge strategies, the other players also maximize j\u2019s utility. In other \nwords, in a Berge equilibrium, every player i maximizes the utilities of the co-players N \\ {i}, \nand i\u2019s utility is simultaneously maximized by those co-players. In a Berge\u2013Vaisman \nequilibrium, because of Condition 2, it is also the case that a selfishly motivated player could not \nobtain a better payoff by defecting unilaterally. Given standard game-theoretic knowledge and \nrationality assumptions, this stronger Berge\u2013Vaisman equilibrium can therefore arise even if it is \ncommon knowledge in a game that every player but one is altruistically motivated and one is \nselfishly motivated. But reciprocity in the absence of altruism cannot explain the Berge\u2013Vaisman \nequilibrium on its own, because if all players are selfishly motivated, then they will be motivated  \nto select Nash rather than Berge\u2013Vaisman equilibria.  \n \n(a)  P2 \n  W2 Y2 \nP1 \nW1 2, 4 4, 1 \nY1 3, 2 1, 3 \n    \n \n \n (b)  P2  P2 \n  C2 D2  C2 D2 \nP1  \nC1  0, 0, 1 2, 0, 0  1, 0, 1 3, 0, 0 \nD1  0, 0, 1 0, 1, 0  0, 1, 0 0, 1, 0 \n  C3  D3 \n  P3 \n \nFig. 1. Two games without Berge equilibria: (a) Gibbard\u2019s two-player game; (b) an arbitrary three-player game. \n \n2.1. Examples of Berge equilibria \nNot all games have Berge equilibria, as shown by the following two-player and three-player \ngames. Fig. 1(a) shows Gibbard\u2019s (1974) game, a 2 \u00d7 2 game lacking (in pure strategies) both \nNash equilibria and Berge equilibria. Gibbard\u2019s interpretation is of two players living together \nand choosing either white (W) or yellow (Y) as a color to decorate their bedrooms. Player 1 is a \nnonconformist who prefers to have a different color from Player 2, whereas Player 2 is a \nconformist who prefers to have the same color as Player 1; and secondary to these preferences, \neach player prefers white to yellow. Representing the players\u2019 preferences from best to worst by \nthe ordinal numbers 4, 3, 2, and 1, the payoffs are as shown in Fig. 1(a). The lack of any Berge \nequilibrium is confirmed by the following strict inequalities, covering all four possible outcomes, \neach violating Condition (1) in the definition of the Berge equilibrium above: \n \nMutual support in games  7   \nU1(W1, W2) < U1(W1, Y2); \nU2(W1, Y2) < U2(Y1, Y2); \nU2(Y1, W2) < U2(W1, W2); \nU1(Y1, Y2) < U1(Y1, W2). \n \nFig. 1(b) shows a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 game with Nash equilibria at (C1, C2, C3), (C1, D2, C3), \n(C1, C2, D3), and (C1, D2, D3). In spite of this plethora of Nash equilibria, the game has no Berge \nequilibrium, because each of the following strict inequalities violates Condition (1): \n \nU1(C1, C2, C3) < U1(C1, C2, D3); \nU1(C1, C2, D3) < U1(C1, D2, C3); \nU1(C1, D2, C3) < U1(C1, D2, D3); \nU2(C1, D2, D3) < U2(D1, D2, C3); \nU2(D1, C2, C3) < U2(D1, C2, D3); \nU3(D1, C2, D3) < U3(C1, C2, D3); \nU3(D1, D2, C3) < U3(C1, C2, C3); \nU3(D1, D2, D3) < U3(C1, C2, D3). \n \nThe first inequality shows that the outcome (C1, C2, C3) cannot be a Berge equilibrium, because \nPlayer 1 receives a better payoff in the outcome (C1, C2, D3), where Player 3 has switched to D, \nviolating Condition (1), and so on for each of the eight possible outcomes of the game in order, \nforcing the conclusion that the game has no Berge equilibrium. \nRestricting attention to symmetric 2 \u00d7 2 games in which both players have strict preferences \namong the four outcomes, and representing their payoffs once again by the ordinal numbers 4, 3, \n2, and 1, there are exactly 12 such ordinally distinct symmetric 2 \u00d7 2 games to consider \n(Rapoport, Guyer, & Gordon, 1976). It turns out that each of these games has at least one Nash \nequilibrium and at least one Berge equilibrium, as detailed below. \nIn six cases, Nash and Berge equilibria coincide, as shown in Fig. 2, where the Nash-Berge \nequilibria are shaded. Some of these games are sufficiently well known to have familiar names: \nRapoport (1967) originally named Fig. 2(b) Hero, and Fig. 2(d) Leader; and Sen (1969) named \nFig. 2(f) the Assurance game. \n \n(a)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1 \nC1 4, 4 3, 2 \nD1 2, 3 1, 1 \n \n (b)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1 \nC1 2, 2 4, 3 \nD1 3, 4 1, 1 \n \n (c)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1 \nC1 4, 4 2, 3 \nD1 3, 2 1, 1 \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n     \n(d)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1 \nC1 2, 2 3, 4 \nD1 4, 3 1, 1 \n \n (e)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1 \nC1 4, 4 2, 1 \nD1 1, 2 3, 3 \n \n (f)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1 \nC1 4, 4 1, 2 \nD1 2, 1 3, 3 \n \n \nFig. 2.

Fig. 3(a) is sometimes called the Chicken game, after an interpretation by the \nphilosopher Bertrand Russell (1959, p. 30) of a dangerous game in which two motorists speed \ntoward each other on a head-on collision course, and if either player swerves out of the way, then \nthat player is shown to be \u201cchicken.\u201d It is sometimes called the Hawk-Dove game, after a \nbiological interpretation by Maynard Smith and Price (1973) of conventional and escalated \nfighting in animals, or the Snowdrift game, after a scenario suggested by Sugden (1986, p. 128) \nin which two motorists on a lonely road, both equipped with shovels, are stuck in a snowdrift. It \nhas Nash equilibria at (D1, C2) and (C1, D2) and a unique Berge equilibrium at (C1, C2). Fig. 3(b) \nis the Stag Hunt game, named after a passage in Rousseau (1755, Part II, paragraph 9), in which \ntwo hunters have to cooperate to catch a stag, but each is tempted to chase after the lesser prize \nof a hare, which can be caught without the other\u2019s cooperation, and it was introduced into the \nliterature of game theory by Lewis (1969, p. 7); it has Nash equilibria at (C1, C2) and (D1, D2) \nand a unique Berge equilibrium at (C1, C2). Fig. 3(c) shows a game with a unique Nash \nequilibrium at (C1, C2) and multiple Berge equilibria at (C1, D2) and (D1, C2).

Game 4(b) is the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game, first named by \nTucker (1950\/2001), with a unique Nash equilibrium at (D1, D2) and a unique Berge equilibrium \nat (C1, C2). \n \nMutual support in games  9   \n(a)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1  \nC1  3, 3 4, 1 \nD1  1, 4 2, 2 \n \n (b)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1  \nC1  3, 3 1, 4 \nD1  4, 1 2, 2 \n \n \nFig. 4. Ordinally distinct symmetric 2 \u00d7 2 games with unique Nash equilibria and non-coinciding unique Berge \nequilibria. \nIt is clear that Berge equilibria are sometimes more numerous than Nash equilibria, \nsometimes less numerous, and sometimes equally numerous, although even in the last case Berge \nand Nash equilibria do not necessarily coincide. Our exhaustive survey of ordinally distinct, \nsymmetric 2 \u00d7 2 games gives an indication of how common Berge equilibria are in these small \ngames. In Section 2.3 below, we shall show that Berge equilibria are ubiquitous in a class of n-\nplayer games frequently encountered in social, economic, and political interactions in everyday \nlife. \n \n2.2. Relations between Berge and Nash equilibria \nWe now examine the relation between Berge equilibria and Nash equilibria. Recall that, with \nour usual notation, s* is a Nash equilibrium if  \n ( ) ( ),i i i iU s U\u2217 \u2217\u2212 \u2264s s  (3) \nfor all si \u2208 Si and all i \u2208 N. In other words, if the players have chosen a Nash equilibrium \nstrategy profile, and if i changes to a different strategy and the other players do not, then i\u2019s \npayoff will not increase. \nIn the particular case of two-player games, there is a high degree of symmetry between the \nNash and Berge conditions. Intuitively, players in a two-player game may be thought to \ninterchange their payoff functions, in some sense, when they switch between Berge and Nash \nequilibria. We clarify and formalize this idea in the following lemma. \n \nLemma 2. The strategy profile s* in the two-player game \n{ } ( ) ( )1 2 1 2: 1, 2 , , , ,G S S U U=  \nis a Berge equilibrium if and only if it is a Nash equilibrium in the game \n{ } ( ) ( )1 2 1 2: 1, 2 , , , ,G S S V V=  \nwith V1 = U2 and V2 = U1. \n \nProof. It suffices to observe that the statement \n( ) ( )1 2 1 1 21, ,U s s U s s\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2264 and ( ) ( )* * *2 1 2 2 1 2, ,U s s U s s\u2264  \nfor all s1 \u2208 S1, s2 \u2208 S2, and the statement \n( ) ( )2 2 2 1 21, ,V s s V s s\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2264 and ( ) ( )* * *1 2 21 1 1, ,V s s V s s\u2264  \nfor all s1 \u2208 S1, s2 \u2208 S2, are equivalent.          \uf06f \n \nWe now extend part of this result to n-player games, but first we need to introduce some \nadditional notation. If \u03c3 : N \u2192 N is a permutation, then we say that \u03c3 is a derangement if \u03c3(i) \u2260 i \nfor all i \u2208 N. If G is our general game \nMutual support in games  10   \n( ) ( ): , , ,i ii N i NG N S U\u2208 \u2208=  \nand \u03c3 is a derangement, we can define an associated game \n( ) ( ), ,: i ii N i NG N S V\u03c3 \u2208 \u2208=  \nwith Vi = U\u03c3(i). (Here, once again, players interchange payoff functions.) \n \nTheorem 2. If s* is a Berge equilibrium in the game \n( ) ( ): , , ,i ii N i NG N S U\u2208 \u2208=  \nthen it is a Nash equilibrium in every game G\u03c3 with derangement \u03c3. \n \nProof. Suppose that s* is a Berge equilibrium in G. Fix i \u2208 N and let \u03c3 be a derangement. If we \ncan show that \n( ) ( )* *( ) ( ),i i i iU s U\u03c3 \u03c3\u2212 \u2264s s  \nfor all si \u2208 Si and all derangements \u03c3, then the required result will follow. By symmetry, we need \nonly consider the case i = 1, \u03c3(i) = 2. \nBy the definition of Berge equilibrium, \n( ) ( )* *2 2 2 2,U s U\u2212 \u2264s s  \nfor all s\u20132 \u2208 S\u20132.

In particular, \n( ) ( )2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3, , , , , , , ,n nU s s s s U s s s s\u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217 \u2217\u2026 \u2264 \u2026  \nfor all s1 \u2208 S1, and the required result follows.          \uf06f \n \nIf we write E\u03c3 for the set of Nash equilibria of G\u03c3 and B for the set of Berge equilibria of G, \nthen we have proved that \n,B E\u03c3\u2286 \uf049  \nwhere \u03c3 ranges over all derangements of N. The following corollary follows immediately. \n \nCorollary 1. If any of the games G\u03c3 with derangement \u03c3 has no Nash equilibrium, then the \ncorresponding game G has no Berge equilibrium and B = \u2205. \n \nWe now provide a link between Berge equilibria in n-player games and Nash equilibria in \nsome associated two-player games. Consider our general game \n( ) ( ): , , .i ii N i NG N S U\u2208 \u2208=  \nFor every j \u2208 N, we define an associated two-player game \n{ } ( ) ( ): , , ( ), ( ) , ( ), ( ) ,j A C A CG A C T j T j V j V j=  \nwith \n( ) ( ), ,A j C jT j S T j S\u2212= =  \nand \n( )( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ), , , , , .A j j i j j C j j j j j\ni j\nV j s U s V j s U s\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u2260\n= =\u2211s s s s  \nMutual support in games  11   \nWe write Ej for the set of Nash equilibria in the game Gj. \n \nTheorem 3. With the notation just introduced, \n .j\nj N\nB E\n\u2208\n= \uf049  \n \nProof. We begin by showing that B \u2286 Ej for every j \u2208 N. By symmetry, it suffices to show that B \n\u2286 E1. We write TA = TA(1), TC = TC(1), VA = VA(1), and VC = VC(1). \nSuppose s* \u2208 B. By definition of Berge equilibrium, we have \n( ) ( )*,i i i iU s U\u2217 \u2212 \u2264s s  \nfor all s\u2013i \u2208 S\u2013i and all i \u2208 N.

In particular, \n( ) ( )* * * * * *1 2 1 1, , , , , , ,i i i i n iU s s s s s s U\u2212 +\u2026 \u2026 \u2264 s  \nfor all s1 \u2208 S1 and i \u2260 1.

This shows that s* is a Nash equilibrium of G1, as required. \nWe have shown that .jj NB E\u2208\u2286 \uf049  Now suppose that .jj N E\u2217 \u2208\u2208s \uf049  We wish to show that \ns* \u2208 B, that is \n( ) ( )*,i i i iU s U\u2217 \u2212 \u2264s s  \nfor all s\u2013i \u2208 S\u2013i and all i \u2208 N.

It follows that \n.j\nj N\nB E\n\u2208\n= \uf049           \uf06f \n \nMutual support in games  12   \nRemark. Theorem 3 establishes that the Berge equilibria of an n-player game G can be \ndetermined by finding the common Nash equilibria in the associated two-player games G\u03c3. Well \nknown procedures are available for finding Nash equilibria in two-player games; therefore \nTheorem 3 suggests a straightforward procedure for finding Berge equilibria in n-player games. \nCorollary 1 shows that if any of the two-player games Gi has no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, \nthen the n-player game G has no Berge equilibrium. \n \n2.3. Interpreting cooperation \nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game shown in Fig. 4(b) is widely interpreted as a game-theoretic \nmodel of cooperation, with the C strategies representing cooperation and the D strategies \ndefection or non-cooperation. It is generally agreed that (D1, D2) is the uniquely rational strategy \nprofile, but a large volume of experimental evidence reveals that cooperation is commonplace in \nthis game. In most published experiments, approximately half the observed strategy choices are \ncooperative, even in experiments with unrepeated or one-shot Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas (Colman \n1995, chap. 7, 2003; Sally, 1995). \nWhether or not C is interpreted as cooperative or altruistic, Berge equilibrium offers a \ntheoretical model of the empirical findings. If players are altruistically motivated to be mutually \nsupportive, rather than to pursue their individual self-interests in terms of objective payoffs, and \nif they expect their co-players to be motivated similarly to themselves, then it makes sense for \nthem to choose Berge strategies as a means of achieving that goal. In the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma \ngame, if both players simultaneously choose Berge strategies, then each receives a better payoff \nthan if both choose dominant Nash strategies. With the payoffs shown in Fig. 4(b), for example, \neach player receives 3 units in Berge equilibrium, but only 2 units in Nash equilibrium. Altruistic \nmutual support pays better than selfish individualism, provided that both players adopt it. \n \nTable 1. Payoff function for a three-player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. \n \nNumber choosing C Number choosing D Payoff to each C-chooser Payoff to each D-chooser \n3 0 3 \u2013 \n2 1 2 4 \n1 2 1 3 \n0 3 \u2013 2 \n \nThis property of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game generalizes to n-player social dilemmas, \nformalized independently by Hamburger (1973) and Schelling (1973). The payoff functions of a \nthree-player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma are shown in Table 1. A generalized n-Player Prisoner\u2019s \nDilemma (n \u2265 2), including the three-player game shown in Table 1, is defined by the following \nthree properties: \n(1). Every player\u2019s strategy set comprises two strategies: C (cooperate) and D (defect). \n(2). The D strategy is strictly dominant for every player\u2014every player obtains a higher \npayoff by choosing D than C, irrespective of the number of co-players choosing C. \n(3). The dominant D strategies intersect in a Pareto-inefficient Nash equilibrium, the outcome \nbeing better for every player if all players choose C than if all choose D. \nThe two-player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game meets this definition and is therefore a special case \nof the more general n-Player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. In two-player and n-player social dilemmas, \njoint defection is the unique Nash equilibrium, and joint cooperation the unique Berge \nequilibrium. In the game shown in Table 1, if all players choose their dominant D strategies, then \nMutual support in games  13   \nthe payoff to each player is 2 units in Nash equilibrium; but if all players choose their C \nstrategies, then the payoff to each is 3 units in Berge equilibrium. Social dilemmas with the \nstrategic structure of the n-Player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game are ubiquitous in everyday social, \npolitical, and economic life, from conservation of scarce resources to wage inflation and global \nwarming. Situations in which individuals are tempted to act selfishly, but everyone ends up \nworse off if everyone acts selfishly than if everyone cooperates, are remarkably common. \nA class of decomposable n-Player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma games can be characterized as \nfollows. Let each of the n players receive an amount c for choosing C and an amount d for \nchoosing D; in addition, let each player lose an amount e for every player in the game who \nchooses D. In the game shown in Table 1, c = 3, d = 5, and e = 1. In the two-player version \nshown in Fig. 4(b), c = 3, d = 6, and e = 2. We can express the payoff to a D-chooser when all \nco-players choose C as d \u2013 e , the payoff to a D-chooser when all co-players choose D as d \u2013 ne, \nthe payoff to a C-chooser when all co-players choose C as c, and the payoff to a C-chooser when \nall co-players choose D as c \u2013 (n \u2013 1)e. The defining properties of the generalized decomposable \nn-Player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game are the inequalities \nd \u2013 e > c > d \u2013 ne > c \u2013 (n \u2013 1)e. \nSimplifying, we find that n > 1, which means simply that the number of players must be two or \nmore, and combining the inequalities, we arrive at \n1 ,d c n\ne\n\u2212\n< <  \nwhich is a generating formula for a decomposable n-Player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game of any \nsize. Any such game has a unique Nash equilibrium representing joint defection and a unique \nBerge equilibrium representing joint cooperation. That joint cooperation is a Berge equilibrium \nfollows from the fact that c > c \u2013 ke for all k (0 < k < n), satisfying the definition (1) of a Berge \nequilibrium provided earlier. \nA large body of empirical evidence reveals that cooperation is very common, even in \nunrepeated n-Player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma games (Camerer & Fehr, 2006; Colman, 1995, chap. 9, \nColman, 2003; Sally, 1995; Suleiman, Budescu, Fischer, & Messick, 2004), and these findings \nare difficult to understand within the conceptual framework of game theory. In social dilemmas \nof all sizes, Berge equilibrium offers a model of cooperation that has not been explored by \nprevious researchers. Players motivated by the altruistic social value orientation may select \nBerge strategies in the expectation that other players will act similarly, knowing that if these \nexpectations are fulfilled, then the mutually supportive players will end up better off, even in \nterms of objective payoffs, than if they had followed the game-theoretic logic of strategic \ndominance and Nash equilibrium. \n \n3. Coordination in common interest games \nOne of the most serious limitations of game theory, and a major reason for its notorious \nindeterminacy, is its frequent failure to provide a rational justification for the selection of payoff-\ndominant Nash equilibria. Consider the game shown in Fig. 5(a), a version of the Stag Hunt \ngame discussed at length by Harsanyi and Selten (1988, pp. 355-363). Both (C1, C2) and (D1, D2) \nare Nash equilibria, and both players prefer (C1, C2), yielding payoffs of (9, 9), to (D1, D2), \nyielding payoffs of (7, 7). The Nash equilibrium (C1, C2) payoff-dominates (D1, D2) because it \nyields a better payoff to both players than does (D1, D2) or, to put it differently, because (C1, C2) \nPareto-dominates (D1, D2). Nevertheless, the indeterminacy of game theory is revealed in this \ngame, because game theory provides neither player with any reason to choose the C strategy, in \nMutual support in games  14   \nspite of its intuitive appeal. Player i has no reason to choose Ci in the absence of a reason to \nexpect Player j to choose Cj. \n \n(a)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1  \nC1  9, 9 0, 8 \nD1  8, 0 7, 7 \n \n (b)  P2 \n  C2 D2 \nP1  \nC1  18, 18 8,  8 \nD1  8,  8 14, 14 \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n(c)  P2 \n  H2 L2 \nP1  \nH1  2, 2 0, 0 \nL1  0, 0 1, 1 \n \n (d)  P2 \n  H2 L2 \nP1  \nH1  4, 4 0, 0 \nL1  0, 0 2, 2 \n \n \nFig. 5.

Any game with multiple Nash equilibria, including one that payoff-dominates all \nothers is called a common interest game (Aumann & Sorin, 1989). The payoff dominance \nprinciple is the assumption that if an equilibrium e payoff-dominates all others in a common \ninterest game, then rational players will choose and play the component strategies of e. Harsanyi \nand Selten (1988) proposed this principle (together with a secondary risk dominance principle) \nas an axiom of rationality in their general theory of equilibrium selection in games, though only \nprovisionally and reluctantly (see their comments on pp. 362-363), acknowledging that it \nprovides no explanation for the powerful intuition that payoff-dominant equilibria should be \nselected by rational players. \nFig. 5(c) exposes payoff dominance in its simplest and most transparent form. In this Hi-Lo \nmatching game, there are Nash equilibria at (H1, H2) and (L1, L2), and both players prefer (H1, \nH2). However, Player 1 has no reason to choose H1 in the absence of a reason to expect Player 2 \nto choose H2, because if Player 2 were to choose L2, for whatever reason, then Player 1\u2019s best \nreply would be L1. But Player 1 has no reason to expect Player 2 to choose H2, because the game \nis symmetric and Player 2 faces the identical dilemma, hence any attempt to justify such \nexpectations leads to an infinite and inconclusive regress. Orthodox game theory provides no \nreason for either player to choose the cooperative H strategies.2 \n \n3.1. Berge equilibrium, coordination, and payoff dominance \nDoes the Berge equilibrium offer a solution to the payoff dominance problem? Surprisingly, \nalthough it provides a solution to the Stag Hunt game shown in Fig. 5(a), and to other similar \ngames, it does not solve the Hi-Lo game shown in Fig. 5(c). The Stag Hunt game has a unique \nBerge equilibrium at (C1, C2), but the Hi-Lo game has Berge equilibria coinciding with the Nash \nequilibria at both (H1, H2) and (L1, L2), providing no remedy for game-theoretic indeterminacy \nand no insight into the intuitive appeal of the H strategies in this game. \nMutual support in games  15   \nAttempts to rationalize the payoff-dominant equilibrium (H1, H2) in Fig. 5(c) have all \nresorted to essential changes in the specification of the game, introducing either repetitions (e.g., \nAumann & Sorin, 1989), a \u201ccheap talk\u201d stage during which players can make costless \nannouncements before choosing their strategies (e.g., Farrell, 1988), modifications of the \nassumption that players know that they choose their strategies independently (e.g., Colman & \nBacharach, 1997; Krueger, 2008; Krueger & Acevedo, 2007), or special modes of reasoning \n(Bacharach, 1999, 2006; Sugden, 1993, 2005). \nThe cooperative value orientation offers a promising potential explanation for coordination, \nbecause it is interpreted in interdependence theory as the motive of Player i to maximize the \ncollective utility function defined as the sum of the objective payoffs to Players i and j. However, \nit has three important limitations. First, it is defined for two-player games only, although the \ndefinition could be generalized to n-player games without difficulty. Second, in its simplest form \nit incorporates an implicit assumption that cooperatively motivated players assign equal weight \nto their own and their co-players\u2019 objective payoffs. Whereas it seems reasonable to assume that \nplayers commonly assign some weight to their co-players\u2019 objective payoffs, the stronger \nassumption of equal weights seems unnecessarily restrictive. Third and most important, it turns \nout to be powerless to explain the payoff dominance phenomenon. \nIf both players are motivated by the cooperative value orientation, then, by definition, \n( ) ( ), , ,i i j i j i jU s s f u u u u\u2032 = = +  \nfor all i, j \u2208 N. Fig. 5(b) shows the Stag Hunt game with these payoff transformations applied. \nThe transformed payoff matrix still has Nash equilibria at (C1, C2) and (D1, D2), and both players \nstill prefer (C1, C2). Game theory provides no more reason for coordination in this transformed \nmatrix than in the original (given) matrix: from a strategic point of view, nothing has changed. \nFig. 5(d) shows that cooperative payoff transformations are of no help in solving the Hi-Lo \ngame, leaving the strategic structure of the game unchanged. The cooperative value orientation, \non its own, fails to explain coordination and the payoff dominance phenomenon, but with some \ncrucial supplementary assumptions, team reasoning solves both problems. \nTheories of team reasoning (Bacharach, 1999, 2006; Sugden, 1993, 2005) offer general \nsolutions to common interest games and to the payoff dominance problem, even in instances \nsuch as the Hi-Lo game where Berge equilibrium surprisingly fails, and they also complement \nthe Berge equilibrium by offering an alternative model of cooperation in the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma \nand n-Player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma games. However, they require a radical departure from \northodox game theory, assuming as they do not only that players are motivated to maximize \ncollective payoffs, as in the cooperative social value orientation, but also that they adopt a \ndistinctive mode of collective reasoning from preferences to decisions. In orthodox game-\ntheoretic reasoning, players ask themselves: What do I want, and what should I do to achieve it? \nIn team reasoning, they ask: What do we want, and what should I do to help achieve it? Even in \nthe most challenging Hi-Lo game shown in Fig. 5(c), the answer is immediately obvious\u2014We \nwant (H1, H2) and, in my role as Player i, I should play my part in achieving it by choosing Hi. \nTeam-reasoning players begin by searching for a profile of strategies that maximizes the \ncollective payoff of the group of players. If one profile Pareto-dominates all others, then that \nprofile obviously maximizes the collective payoff. More generally, and in the spirit of the \ncooperative value orientation, if there exists a strategy profile that maximizes the sum of payoffs \nto the individual players,3 then that profile is collectively optimal, even if it is not a Nash \nequilibrium. If the optimizing profile is unique, then team-reasoning players select and play their \ncomponent strategies of it. If it is not unique, then the theory is indeterminate. Standard \nMutual support in games  16   \nindividual reasoning is subsumed within team reasoning as a special case in which the team is a \nsingleton. There is evidence from experimental games that team reasoning occurs quite \nfrequently in practice (Colman, Pulford, & Rose, 2008). \n \n4. Related literature \nPrevious research into the Berge equilibrium and social value orientations has been sparse, \nand the relevant literature is widely scattered. The Berge equilibrium concept was introduced \nintuitively by the French mathematician Claude Berge (1957) for noncooperative games (chap. 1, \nsection 7) and coalition games (chap. 5, section 27) at a time when he was a visiting professor at \nPrinceton University and a colleague there of John Nash, who was on an Alfred P. Sloan grant. A \nbrief review of Berge\u2019s book by Shubik (1961), published in Econometrica, could hardly have \ndone more to discourage economists from reading it and may have contributed to its subsequent \nneglect in the English-speaking world: \u201cThe argument is presented in a highly abstract manner \nand no consideration is given to applications to economics. . . . The book will be of little direct \ninterest to economists\u201d (p. 821). \nBerge\u2019s (1957) book was translated into Russian in 1961, and Zhukovskii (1985) later \nformalized the equilibrium in the context of differential games. Condition (2) was first suggested \nby Zhukovskii\u2019s doctoral student Konstantin Vaisman and adopted by Zhukovskii and Chikrii \n(1994, pp. 119-143) in a book published later in the same year, also in Russian. Research into the \nBerge equilibrium did not spread beyond the borders of the former USSR until Abalo and \nKostreva (2004, 2005) published the first existence theorems for pure-strategy Berge equilibria \nin strategic-form games based on an existence theorem for differential games proposed by Radjef \n(1988). Radjef, who was a student of Zhukovskii, was one of many Algerian students trained in \nRussian Universities, and that is why research published in Russian journals has been \ndisseminated in some French journals by Algerian researchers. Nessah, Larbani, and Tazda\u00eft \n(2007) and Larbani and Nessah (2008) showed the conditions set by Abalo and Kostreva to be \ninsufficient to prove the existence of a pure-strategy Berge equilibria, and they proposed a new \nexistence theorem. The Berge equilibrium has, up to now, received only a small amount of \nattention from mathematicians and virtually none from economists and other social and \nbehavioral scientists. \nThe concept of social value orientations, interpreted in terms of payoff transformations, was \nintroduced by Messick and McClintock (1968) and McClintock (1972), who focused attention \ninitially on individualistic, cooperative, and competitive orientations. The idea was developed in \ninterdependence theory by Thibaut and Kelley (1959), Kelley and Thibaut (1978), and Kelley, \nHolmes, Kerr, Reis, Rusbult, and Van Lange (2003). Research revealed that individual \ndifferences in baseline social value orientations are relatively stable over time (Kuhlman, Camac, \n& Cunha, 1986), correlate significantly with personality descriptions given by friends and \nroommates (Bem & Lord, 1979), and are predictive of activities in everyday life such as \nvolunteering for worthy causes (McClintock & Allison, 1989). A century earlier, Edgeworth \n(1881, pp. 102-104) had introduced the idea of other-regarding payoff transformations in a \nslightly more general form, in which Player i maximizes the utility function U'(si, sj) = fi (ui, uj) = \npui + (1 \u2013 p)uj, where 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1. Here, p and 1 \u2013 p represent relative weights that i assigns to ui \n(own) and uj (co-player\u2019s) objective payoffs, respectively. Economists who have explored other-\nregarding utilities have generally reverted to this more general interpretation (e.g., Camerer, \n1997, pp. 169-170; Fehr & Schmidt, 1999; Rabin, 1993). \n \nMutual support in games  17   \n5. Conclusions \nBerge equilibrium provides a compelling model of cooperation in social dilemmas, including \nthe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and n-Player Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma games. It deserves to be taken \nseriously, because an understanding of cooperation is an important goal, and especially because \northodox game theory has failed to explain experimental findings on cooperation adequately. \nA Berge equilibrium occurs when players are mutually supportive in a game. It is thus \nreminiscent of the concepts of solidarity and mutual aid suggested by the Russian anarchist Peter \nKropotkin (1902): \n \nLove, sympathy and self-sacrifice certainly play an immense part in the progressive development of our moral \nfeelings. But it is not love and not even sympathy upon which Society is based in mankind. It is the \nawareness4\u2014be it only at the stage of an instinct\u2014of human solidarity. It is the unconscious recognition of the \nforce that is borrowed by each man from the practice of mutual aid; of the close dependency of every one\u2019s \nhappiness upon the happiness of all; and of the sense of justice, or equity, which brings the individual to \nconsider the rights of every other individual as equal to his own. (p. 5) \n \nBerge equilibrium is a theoretical implication of the altruistic social value orientation, in \nwhich players have utility functions that motivate them to maximize each other\u2019s objective \npayoffs. Together with otherwise standard game-theoretic assumptions of rationality and \ncommon knowledge, this implies the emergence of Berge equilibria in games in which they \nexist. The existence of pure altruism has been debated by philosophers for centuries (see, e.g., \nBentham, 1789; Comte, 1851\/1875; Hume, 1739-1740), and there are skeptics who have argued \nthat selfish egoism or individualism must be tautologically true, because people\u2019s actions reveal \ntheir individual preferences. Samuelson (1993), the originator of revealed preference theory, \ndismissed this view as mere casuistry: \n \nWhen the governess of infants caught in a burning building reenters it unobserved in a hopeless mission of \nrescue, casuists may argue; \u201cShe did it only to get the good feeling of doing it. Because otherwise she wouldn\u2019t \nhave done it.\u201d Such argumentation (in Wolfgang Pauli\u2019s scathing phrase) is not even wrong. It is just boring, \nirrelevant, and in the technical sense of old-fashioned logical positivism \u201cmeaningless\u201d (p. 143). \n \nPure altruism is evidently not the most common social value orientation in strategic interactions; \nbut its existence cannot be ignored, and there are circumstances in which it seems entirely \nnatural. Accumulating experimental evidence, reviewed in the Introduction (Section 1), makes it \ndifficult to deny that there are circumstances in which altruism is a regular occurrence. In our \nbenchmark game outlined informally in the Introduction (Section 1), altruism and Berge \nequilibrium seem intuitively compelling. \nWe have shown how the Berge equilibrium provides a natural model of cooperation in n-\nPlayer Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas, and how it can also model coordination in some common interest \ngames, although it is inadequate in the sharpest challenge, the pure coordination Hi-Lo matching \ngame. The cooperative social value orientation, in which players are motivated to maximize their \ncollective payoff, explains cooperation in social dilemmas and might be expected to explain \ncoordination in common interest games. However, it turns out to be inadequate to explain \ncoordination without additional theoretical apparatus provided by theories of team reasoning. \nBerge equilibrium and team reasoning are both powerful theories of mutual support in \ngames. They model two of the most important forms of social collaboration, namely cooperation \nin social dilemmas and coordination in common interest games. Team reasoning has received at \nleast some attention from researchers in the social and behavioral sciences; Berge equilibrium \nMutual support in games  18   \nhas hitherto received virtually none, but our preliminary exploration suggests that it merits \nfurther investigation. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe wish to thank Denis Bouyssou, Bertrand Crettez, Regis Deloche, Patrice Dumas, Moussa Larbani, Rabia \nNessah, Daniel Th\u00e9ry, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on an earlier version of this article. \n \nReferences \nAbalo, K., & Kostreva, M.

This article focuses on elementary games in which players can choose pure strategies only. \n \n2 Player i cannot solve the payoff dominance problem by applying the principle of insufficient reason, assuming that \nPlayer j is equally likely to select Hj or Lj, and concluding on this basis that Hi is a best reply. In game theory, the \nplayers\u2019 rationality is assumed to be common knowledge, and it follows from this that, if Player i\u2019s reasoning were \nvalid, then j would anticipate it and would play Hj, the best reply to Hi, with certainty. Player i would anticipate this \nreply, refuting i\u2019s initial assumption that the probability of Hj was 1\/2 and undermining the basis of i\u2019s argument for \nchoosing Hi. The same reductio proof works against any argument based on assigning subjective probabilities to j\u2019s \nstrategies (Colman, 2003; Colman, Pulford, & Rose, 2008). \n \n3 In these circumstances, it makes no sense for players to weight their own and their co-players\u2019 payoffs unequally, \nbecause they are maximizing a collective payoff function. \n \n4 The original has \u201cconscience\u201d\u2014obviously an error by an author whose native tongue was not English. \n \n"}
