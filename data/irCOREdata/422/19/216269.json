Judgement aggregation is concerned with aggregating \nsets of individual judgements over logically connected propositions into a \nset of collective judgements. It has been shown that even seemingly weak \nconditions on the aggregation function make it impossible to find functions \nthat produce rational collective judgements from all possible rational \nindividual judgements. This implies that the step from individual \njudgements to collective judgements requires trade-offs between different \ndesiderata, such as universal domain, rationality, epistemological quality, \nand unbiasedness. These dilemmas challenge us to decide which conditions \nwe should relax. The typical application for judgement aggregation is the \nproblem of group decision making. Juries and expert committees are the \nstock examples. However, the relevance of judgement aggregation goes \nbeyond these cases. In this survey I review some core results in the field of \njudgement aggregation and social epistemology and discuss their \nimplications for the analysis of distributed thinking. \n Introduction \nThinking is often taken as an activity exercised by individuals. In recent years, however, it \nhas been acknowledged that thinking can also be a collective process. It is not only \nindividuals who process information, take stances, and make decisions\u2014groups can do \nthis, too. For instance, a court jury needs to gather information, reach collective stances on \nthe information available, and make a decision on the sentence. The same is true for \ncabinets, expert panels, shipping crews, air-traffic controllers, appointment committees, et \ncetera. Individuals can differ in their ability to process information rationally and reach \ncorrect decisions. Similarly, groups can differ in their success to arrive at correct decisions, \nand they may arrive at these decisions in a rational or in an irrational way. In this sense \ngroups are engaged in collective thinking.  \nIt is difficult to observe how individuals process complex information and arrive at a \ndecision. For groups, however, this process is more transparent. Psychologists and social \nscientists can observe how groups deliberate, how they form judgements, and how they \nfinally reach decisions. These collective decision processes can be compared and \nevaluated. Some processes are obviously epistemically poor and irrational: For instance, a \ncourt jury should not throw a coin to decide whether a defendant is guilty; an expert panel \nshould (arguably) not randomly select one expert to make all decisions, a cabinet should \n - 2 - \nnot always choose the course of action with the least support, etc. But it is more difficult to \ndetermine good collective decision procedures, and we will see that it is often impossible \nto determine collective decision procedures that meet some seemingly harmless desiderata.  \nDifferent strands of literature have discussed the nature of distributed thinking. One \nstrand, inspired by the psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1962, 1978), analyses distributed \nthinking in relation to distributed cognition. In recent years, this research paradigm was \nadvanced by Edwin Hutchins (1995) and his influential study of \u201ccognition in the wild\u201d. \nResearch on distributed cognition was also influenced by Andy Clark\u2019s and David \nChalmers\u2019 concept of the \u201cextended mind\u201d (Clark and Chalmers, 1998; Clark, 1997). This \napproach emphasizes that the boundaries between mind and world are often difficult to \ndraw, and that organisms reshape their environment to solve the problems they encounter. \nThe mind is a \u201cleaky organ\u201d, as Clark (1997, p. 53) puts it, \u201cmingling shamelessly with \nbody and with world\u201d.  \nAnother strand of literature that tackles the phenomenon of distributed thinking draws \non concepts from social choice theory and social epistemology. Goldman (2004) and List \n(2005, forthcominga) have pointed out that there are at least two dimensions on which a \ngroup\u2019s performance as a thinking system can be measured. First, the group can succeed or \nfail to be rational, where rationality is understood as avoiding logical contradictions in the \njudgements the group makes. Second, the group can be more or less successful in reaching \ncorrect decisions, given the information available. The first dimension poses a \u201crationality\u201d \nor \u201ccoherence\u201d challenge, the second a \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201ccorrespondence\u201d challenge to the \ngroup. The rationality challenge can be explored with tools provided by social choice \ntheory, the knowledge challenge with generalizations of the Condorcet Jury Theorem and \nthe information pooling literature.  \nSocial choice theory systematically investigates the processes to aggregate individual \ninformation into collective information. The classical problem for social choice theory is \nthe aggregation of preferences. The famous Arrow Theorem shows that there is no \naggregation procedure to map the individual preferences to collective preferences that \nmeets some seemingly harmless and arguably normatively desirable conditions (Arrow, \n1963). While the aggregation of preferences is of great importance for welfare economics, \nit is not quite the right framework to address distributed thinking. However, recently the \nsocial choice framework has been extended to the more general question of judgement \naggregation. Judgement aggregation investigates different procedures to aggregate \nindividual judgements to collective judgements. Again, impossibility results arise, posing \nchallenges for distributed thinking.  \nRelated to the field of judgement aggregation are considerations regarding the epistemic \nquality of different aggregation procedures. The discussion starts with Condorcet\u2019s famous \nobservation that large groups tend to make correct dichotomous choices. But Condorcet\u2019s \nideas can be extended to other choice situations as well. If information is distributed \nbetween agents, and these agents need to arrive at a joint decision based on the \ninformation, then one can ask which procedures are best suited to aggregate this \ninformation to maximize the probability of a correct decision.  \nReturning to the two strands of literature mentioned above, it appears that the \ndistributed cognition approach on the one hand, and the social choice and epistemology \n - 3 - \napproach on the other, talk past each other. So far, the exchange between the two \napproaches has been limited. This paper does not attempt a reconcilliation or propose a \nnew synthesis. The rather more modest goal is to introduce some basic ideas from the field \nof judgement aggregation and considers the upshot for distributed thinking. The paper is in \n4 sections. I start by explaining the problem posed by the \u201cdiscursive dilemma\u201d and how it \npertains to distributed thinking. Section 2 generalizes by approaching problems of \njudgement aggregation more formally. In section 3 I analyze the epistemic performance of \ndifferent judgement aggregation procedures. I discuss the relation between rationality, \nconsistency, and distributed thinking in section 4. At this point, I will return to the relation \nbetween distributed cognition and social choice theory, and discuss how these two \napproaches may relate. More specifically, I will argue that judgement aggregation provides \na framework for the analysis of distributed thinking, despite charges that it is too \nreductionist to be of interest. \n \n 1 The Discursive Dilemma \nA central problem that has triggered much work in the field of judgement aggregation is \nthe so-called \u201cdoctrinal paradox\u201d (Kornhauser and Sager, 1986) or, more generally, the \n\u201cdiscursive dilemma\u201d (List and Pettit, 2002). I start by describing two examples that \nillustrate the problem.  \nConsider three MI5 officers who have to evaluate whether an observed suspect is \nplanning to build a bomb. There are three officers, and they assess the situations by \nforming judgements on correctness of three propositions:  \n\uf0b7 The suspect has bought fertilizer (P).  \n\uf0b7 If the suspect has bought fertilizer, it follows that the subject plans to assemble a \nbomb ( P Q\uf0ae ) .1  \n\uf0b7 The suspect plans to assemble a bomb (Q). \nThese propositions are logically connected. For instance, if an officer believes that the \nsubject has bought fertilizer, and if she also believes that if the subject has bought fertilizer \nthen the subject is building a bomb, then the officer must also hold that the subject plans to \nbuild a bomb. If she does not, the officer\u2019s judgements would be inconsistent.  \nWe assume that all officers (individually) hold consistent sets of beliefs, i. e. they do not \ncontradict themselves, and that they make judgements on all propositions at stake. One \npossible constellation of consistent individual judgements over these three propositions is \nshown in table 1. \n                                                 \n1 For the example discussed here we can take \uf0ae as the material conditional. \n - 4 - \nOfficer  P P Q\uf0ae  Q \n1  true true true \n2  true false false \n3  false true false \nMajority:  true true false \nTable 1: An example of the Discursive Dilemma.  \n \nOfficer 1 thinks that the suspect has bought fertilizer, that if the subject has bought \nfertilizer he is planning to build a bomb, and consequently thinks the suspect builds a \nbomb. Officer 2 also thinks that the suspect has bought fertilizer, but disagrees with the \nclaim that buying fertilizer implies that the suspect builds a bomb, and thinks that the \nsuspect does not build a bomb. Officer 3 disagrees with his two colleagues about whether \nthe suspect has bought fertilizer. He believes that if the suspect had bought fertilizer he \nwould be building a bomb. But since he has not, officer 3 can hold (for whatever reason, as \nno conclusion follows from the premises) that the suspect does not build a bomb.  \nThe problem in this situation is that the three officers will find it difficult to determine \ntheir joint stance as an investigative unit. A majority vote on each proposition yields the \nresults as stated in bottom row of table 1. A majority thinks that the suspect has bought \nfertilizer, a majority thinks that if the suspect has bought fertilizer he is assembling a \nbomb, but a majority also thinks that the suspect is not building a bomb. Thus the majority \njudgements are contradictory. This contradiction instantiates one version of the discursive \ndilemma.  \nConsider a second example to demonstrate that the discursive dilemma comes in \ndifferent forms. Here a team of detectives has to decide whether to bring charges forward \nagainst a suspected murderer. The three detectives consider the following propositions:  \n\uf0b7 The murder weapon is identified (P).  \n\uf0b7 The suspect had a motive (Q). \n\uf0b7 The suspect should be charged (R).  \n\uf0b7 Charges should be brought forward if and only if the weapon is identified and the \nsuspect had a motive ( P Q R\uf0d9 \uf0ab ). \nWe assume that the three detectives all agree on the last proposition, which one can \ninterpret as a universally agreed doctrine. They disagree, however, on the other three \npropositions, as table 2 shows.  \n \n P Q P Q R\uf0d9 \uf0ab  R \nDetective 1  true  true  true  true  \nDetective 2  true  false  true  false  \nDetective 3  false  true  true  false  \nMajority  true  true  true  false  \nTable 2: The discursive dilemma in conjunctive form.  \n \nAs in the first example, each individual position is consistent, but the majority position \n - 5 - \nis not. Holding P, Q, and P Q R\uf0d9 \uf0ab  to be true, but R to be false, is a contradiction. The \nquestion is: how should the three detectives agree on a joint position?  \nIn these examples we can recognize some features of the discursive dilemma and \nproblems of judgement aggregation more generally. First, the dilemmas described here are \nfairly realistic in the sense that there are many situations in which groups of people hold \njudgements over different logically connected propositions and have to form a joint \nposition on these propositions. Second, the examples can easily be extended to groups with \nmore than 3 agents. Third, the individual judgements the agents hold are not unusual or \nunreasonable. Fourth, the dilemma only arises for certain judgement profiles, but the \npossibility of their occurrence challenges us to find judgement aggregation procedures that \ncan deal with these situations.  \nHow does the discursive dilemma pertain to distributed thinking? A thinking system \nunderstood in a minimal way is a system that takes inputs and produces outputs by \nprocessing these inputs. A distributed thinking system can be understood as a group of \nthinkers who coordinate their thinking activities. Since the thinking is distributed, one can \nexpect every single thinker to do some thinking on their own. However, to function as a \nthinking system it is necessary to aggregate the information available to the single thinkers \nand produce a collective output. Judgement aggregation is a model of such a process: Each \nindividual is a single thinker with stances on certain propositions. Since the single thinkers \nare part of a distributed thinking system, the system must aggregate their stances on the \npropositions and produce a collective stance. In the same way as we want single thinkers to \nbe rational, we also require a system of distributed thinking to be rational. Judgement \naggregation maps out the logical space of possible aggregation procedures and informs us \nof the options and constraints for distributed thinking.  \nThe notion of \u201cthinking\u201d in the analysis offered here is deliberately minimal. It \npresupposes only that thinkers assign truth values to each proposition and that thinkers \ncorrectly apply propositional logic. In addition, the distributed thinking system must be \nable follow an aggregation rule. The problems arising from this simplified notion of \nthinking are neither trivial nor simple, and it is worthwhile to start with simple examples \nbefore moving on to more complex analyses. This minimal notion of thinking deliberately \nomits many other aspects of human thinkers: People can have degrees of beliefs, not just \ndichotomous judgements. Thinking does not only involve beliefs, but also desires. A \ncomplete picture of human thinking would also incorporate intentions, emotions, and \nconsciousness. Nonetheless, I argue that such a rich notion of thinking can be set aside for \nnow. It can be set aside because even the minimal notion of thinking used in this paper \nraises interesting questions about the rationality and epistemic quality of distributed \nthinking systems.  \n 2 Impossibility Results And Escape Routes \nI now describe the problem of judgement aggregation more generally and explain List and \nPettit\u2019s (2002) impossibility result. Each individual has a set of judgements on a given \nagenda. The agenda contains all propositions in question and their respective negations. \nFor the impossibility result to arise, the agenda must be sufficiently complex, that is it must \n - 6 - \ncontain at least two propositions P and Q and either P Q\uf0d9  , P Q\uf0da , or P Q\uf0ae  (and their \nnegations). An individual set of judgements must be complete (so that for all items on the \nagenda, it contains either the proposition or its negation), it must be consistent and \ndeductively closed. If these three conditions are met, we call a judgement set fully rational. \nAll the individual sets of judgements together form a judgement profile. For instance, \ntables 1 and 2 state specific judgement profiles.  \nThe aim of judgement aggregation is to proceed from judgement profiles to a collective \njudgement set. We assume that the collective judgement set must also be consistent, \ncomplete, and deductively closed (this is called the collective rationality condition, see e.g. \nList, forthcominga) and that the aggregation function never fails to produce output. An \naggregation function has all possible judgement profiles as domain and all possible \ncollective sets of judgements as co-domain, i. e. it maps judgement profiles onto collective \nsets of judgements. Put differently: an aggregation function takes a judgement profile as \ninput and gives one fully rational collective set of judgements as output.  \nList and Pettit describe three desiderata that an aggregation function should meet:  \n\uf020Universal Domain.  \nThe aggregation function accepts as input all logically possible judgement profiles, as \nlong as all individual judgement sets are consistent, complete, and deductively closed.  \n\uf020Anonymity.  \nThe aggregation function is not responsive to permutations of judgement sets in the \nprofile. This means that the outcome should not change if we shuffle the agents, but \nleave everything else unchanged.  \n\uf020Systematicity.  \nThe result of the aggregation function for any proposition depends only on the \njudgements made on this proposition, and the pattern of dependence is the same for \nall propositions. \nUniversal Domain is an immediately convincing desideratum: The aggregation function \nshould be able to aggregate all logically possible profiles, as long as all individuals hold \nfully rational judgements. If the aggregation function did not have a universal domain it \nwould fail to aggregate some judgement profiles that can occur, and there is no good \nreason to rule out any judgement profiles ex ante.  \nAnonymity is also a rather convincing desideratum for many aggregation problems. The \nintuitive appeal behind anonymity is that it ensures the equal treatment of all judgement \nsets, no matter who holds them. For example, anonymity rules out that the aggregation \nfunction always follows the judgement set of one individual, that is it rules out \n\u2018aggregation\u2019 by letting one agent be the dictator.  \nThe systematicity condition is more contested. Note that it contains the weaker \nindependence condition (see. e.g. Dietrich, 2007):  \n\uf020Independence.  \nThe result of the aggregation function for any proposition depends only on the \njudgements made on this proposition. \nThe intuitive plausibility of independence is easy to argue for (even though it is also not \nuncontested). Independence ensures that the collective judgement on a proposition is \ninfluenced only by individual positions on that specific proposition. If we consider a \n - 7 - \nproposition P, changes in the profile regarding any other proposition should not influence \nthe collective judgement on P.  \nSystematicity is more demanding than independence because it also demands that the \nsame pattern of individual judgements on any proposition should lead to the same \ncollective judgement on these propositions. More precisely, for any two propositions P, Q: \nif all individuals have the same judgements on P and on Q , then the collective results for P \nand Q must not differ. The intuitive ideal behind this condition is to treat all propositions \nequally. Systematicity rules out, for instance, the requirement of different qualified \nmajorities for different propositions.  \nList and Pettit state and prove a theorem of judgement aggregation:  \n\uf020Theorem (List and Pettit 2002):  \nThere exists no judgment aggregation function generating complete, consistent and \ndeductively closed collective sets of judgments which satisfies unanimity, anonymity \nand systematicity. \nThis impossibility result has kicked off the research into questions of judgement \naggregation and has led to a flourishing, often technically advanced literature (see List and \nPuppe, 2009, for a survey). The theorem is important because it systematizes the special \ncase of the discursive dilemma and shows that any form of judgement aggregation over a \nsufficiently complex agenda fails to meet all the described desiderata together. This poses a \nchallenge for the aggregation of judgements: Either judgement aggregation fails (for some \nprofiles), or one has to argue that at least one of the desiderata can and should be relaxed in \norder to avoid the impossibility result.2  \nReturning to the examples of the discursive dilemma above, I will now discuss four \nprocedures to arrive at collective judgements: the majority vote on each proposition, the \npremise- and the conclusion-based procedure, and a dictatorship. The majority vote was \nalready mentioned in the introduction of the discursive dilemma. If the collective votes on \nall propositions with simple majority, the group may end up with an inconsistent \njudgement set. This is unsatisfactory, and several ways to avoid this result have been \nproposed. The majority vote on all propositions satisfies universal domain, anonymity and \nsystematicity, but fails to produce fully rational judgement sets for all logically possible \njudgement profiles.  \nThe premise-based procedure divides the propositions on the agenda into two sets: the \npremises and the conclusion(s). A majority vote is taken on each premise, and the premises \nadapted by these votes determine the remaining propositions, i. e. the conclusions, by \ndeductive closure. For the discursive dilemma stated in table 1, P and P Q\uf0ae  can be taken \nas premises, Q as the conclusion. The majority adopts both premises, and deduces that Q \nmust also be true. It therefore reaches the collective judgement set \uf07b \uf07d, ,P P Q Q\uf0ae .3 More \n                                                 \n2 The literature on judgement aggregation has produced many refinements and extensions to List\u2019s and \nPettit\u2019s 2002 result, which cannot be described in detail here. Most important is perhaps Pauly and van \nHees\u2019s (2006) generalizations, and further more general results in Dietrich and List (2007). The general \nstructure of these additions is to discuss other, often weaker or differently constructed desiderata and \nprove impossibility (and sometimes possibility) results for aggregation functions. A very clear framework \nfor judgement aggregation in general logic is provided by Dietrich (2007). \n3 It is not always the case that the propositions can be neatly divided into premises and conclusions. In \naddition, the premises do not necessarily determine the truth value(s) of the conclusion(s). For instance, if \n - 8 - \nloosely speaking, the premise based procedure means: vote on the premises, deduce the \nconclusion. The premise based procedure usually produces fully rational collective \njudgement sets4, but it violates systematicity because the collective judgement on the \nconclusion does not only depend on the individual judgements regarding the conclusion.  \nIn the MI5 example, the worry with the premise based procedure is that it overrules the \nmajority vote. The second and perhaps more obvious procedure to the aggregation problem \nis to disregard the majority vote on the premises and only vote on the conclusion. This is \nthe conclusion based procedure. For table 1 it leads the collective to adopt not-Q. Note that \nthe collective does not take any view on the premises according to the conclusion-based \nview. Therefore, the conclusion-based procedure fails to produce complete collective \njudgement sets.  \nAnother procedure to avoid collective inconsistency is to nominate a dictator, that is a \nperson whose individual judgement set fully determines the collective judgement set. For \ninstance, one could stipulate that the group always adopts the judgements of individual 1. \nSince the individual judgement sets are complete, consistent, and deductively closed, the \n\u201ccollective\u201d judgement set will be, too. A dictatorship is a blatant violation of the \nanonymity condition, because a reshuffling of individuals (in particular, changing the \ndictator) may change the outcome.  \nTable 3 compares the four aggregation procedures. None of the procedures meets all the \ndesiderata and the requirement of collective rationality (completeness, consistency, and \ndeductive closure) together. List\u2019s and Pettit\u2019s theorem shows that there is in fact no \naggregation procedure that can meet all these desiderata together. It is therefore necessary \nto engage in a normative debate as to which desiderata should be sacrificed, or at least \nrelaxed, to find a working aggregation procedure.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                    \nthe votes on the premises had resulted in \uf07b \uf07d,P P Q\uf0d8 \uf0ae , the conclusion Q  would not be determined by \ndeductive closure because both Q and Q\uf0d8  are consistent with the judgements on the premises. \n4 Except for those cases described in note 3. \n - 9 - \nProcedure  Universal Domain  Anonymity  Systematicity  Collective \nRationality  \nMajority rule  +  +  +  \u2013  \nDictator  +  \u2013  +  +  \nPremise-based  +  +  \u2013  +  \nConclusion-based  +  +  +*  \u2013  \nTable 3: Aggregation procedures in comparison (* systematicity holds for the \nconclusions).  \n \nThe desiderata under discussion are motivated by a broadly \u201cdemocratic\u201d set of values \n(see for instance List, 2006). Universal domain can be normatively attractive from a \ndemocratic perspective because a democratically governed group should not rule out \nrational individual judgements ex ante. Anonymity can be attractive because it ensures that \nevery member of the group has the same level of influence over the collective result. \nSystematicity ensures an equal treatment of all propositions, so that the aggregation \nprocedure does not have an ex ante bias to define some propositions as \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cmore \nimportant\u201d. List and Pettit (2002) discuss several options to relax one of the three \ndesiderata, or one of the three rationality conditions completeness, consistency, and \ndeductive closure. Relaxing collective consistency and deductive closure is unattractive, \nbecause it results in irrational collective judgement sets. Other options are more attractive, \ndepending on the circumstances. Relaxing universal domain is plausible when the \nindividuals tend to have judgement profiles that are \u201cwell-behaved\u201d, that is do not give rise \nto the discursive dilemma. Relaxing anonymity may in particular be justified when the \ncompetence in the group is unevenly distributed (List, 2006). Relaxing systematicity is \nperhaps the most attractive move, because the idea that the collective judgements on \ndifferent propositions do not influence each other appears implausible for a set of logically \nconnected propositions in the first place. Even more implausible, systematicity also \ndemands that all propositions are treated exactly equal in that regard. If a group deliberates \non a number of dependent propositions, it should not be ruled out ex ante that the change \nof individual opinions on a proposition \u03a6 can change the collective judgement on another \nproposition \u03a8 , even if the individual judgements on \u03a8 have not changed. Neither should it \nbe ruled out that the same pattern of individual judgements for \u03a6 and for \u03a8 can lead to \ndifferent collective judgements on \u03a6 and \u03a8 .  \nWhen considering distributed thinking systems, the background set of values to decide \non an aggregation procedure does not necessarily have to be \u201cdemocratic\u201d. But the \nproperties one would like to see in a judgement aggregation function for distributed \nthinking may be similar. Universal domain is desirable from a distributed thinking \nperspective because the thinking process should not break down for certain inputs. \nWhether anonymity and systematicity are normatively desirable properties of a distributed \nthinking system is less clear. Anonymity is attractive if every thinking unit in the system of \ndistributed thinking should be treated equally.5 In the same vein, systematicity may be \n                                                 \n5 Also, relaxing anonymity does not yield particularly attractive aggregation procedures. In a very closely \nrelated setup, Pauly and van Hees (2006) show that the only aggregation procedure that meets all other \ndesiderata is a dictatorship. \n - 10 - \nimportant when all propositions on the agenda should be treated equally.  \nEven if we relax one or more of the desiderata, we still need to say how we relax these \ndesiderata and which aggregation functions we want to use. One important criterion for an \naggregation function is that it meets the \u201cknowledge challenge\u201d. This means that the \naggregation function should be good at pooling the individual information that is \ndistributed among individuals to reach correct outcomes. To explore the knowledge \nchallenge in greater detail, I discuss the truth tracking performance of different aggregation \nfunctions.  \n 3 An Epistemic Perspective \nWhen voting on the truth or falsity of a single proposition, the Condorcet Jury Theorem \nshows that large groups can be almost always correct, as long as each member of the group \nis just slightly better than random at identifying the correct choice. Assume there is one \ncorrect state of the world, which is either that \u03a6 or not-\u03a6 is correct (or the better \nalternative). The competence assumption of the Condorcet Jury Theorem states that all \nindividuals have a competence greater than 0.5. The competence of an individual is the \nprobability to choose the correct alternative. With a competence greater than 0.5 the \nindividuals are better than random in making the correct judgement between two \nalternatives.  \nThe Condorcet Jury Theorem tells us: If all individuals have the same level of \ncompetence greater than 0.5, if their votes are independent6, and if they do not \nmisrepresent their personal judgements for strategic reasons, then large groups will almost \ncertainly choose the correct alternative in a majority vote.7 The pooling of the individual \ncompetence in the vote renders the group much more competent than each single \nindividual.  \nLet there be n ndividuals (with n being odd to avoid ties), and let the probability of all \nthe different individuals 1 to n be p , with p > 0.5 . The probability of a group to choose the \ncorrect alternative is (Grofman, Owen and Feld, 1983):  \n \n( 1)\/2\n( , ) (1 ) .\nn\nCJT h n h\nh n\nn\nP n p p p\nh\n\uf02d\n\uf03d \uf02b\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0e8\n\uf03d \uf02d\n\uf0f8\n\uf0e5   (1) \nTable 4 shows the group competence for some levels of individual competence and \ndifferent group sizes. One can see that even for relatively small levels of competence like \n0.55, large groups reach a group competence of almost 100%. Therefore, if the conditions \nof the Condorcet Jury Theorem hold, groups can be excellent \u201ctruth trackers\u201d in \ndichotomous choice situations.  \n \n                                                 \n6 More precisely, if the votes are probabilistically independent, conditional on the truth value of \u03a6. \n7 The joint assumption of competence and independence rarely holds in practice. Weaker versions of the \ntheorem have been proved. Dietrich (2008) points out that it is not possible to (statistically) justify both \nthe independence and the competence assumptions and discusses less demanding assumptions and their \nimplications. \n - 11 - \nn | p  0.501  0.51  0.55  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  \n11  0.503  0.527  0.633  0.753  0.922  0.988  1\uf0bb  \n101  0.508  0.580  0.844  0.979  1\uf0bb  1\uf0bb  1\uf0bb  \n1001  0.525  0.737  0.999  1\uf0bb  1\uf0bb  1\uf0bb  1\uf0bb  \nTable 4: Group competence according to formula 1.  \n \nThe graph in figure 1 shows how the group competence develops for different group \nsizes and different values of p. One can see how larger groups quickly approach high \ncompetence if p >0 .5, but approach a group competence of 0 for p < 0.5 . \n \n*** Figure 1 about here *** \n \nThe Condorcet Jury Theorem is the starting point to analyse richer collective decision \nproblems. For the problems of judgement aggregation discussed above, each single \nproposition is a dichotomous choice problem, but the judgement aggregation problem as a \nwhole is more complex. We have seen that there are different aggregation procedures, each \nwith advantages and drawbacks. One possible normative criterion to decide for one \naggregation procedure is to consider its epistemic performance, that is its ability to \u201ctrack \nthe truth\u201d. Here I focus primarily on a comparison between the conclusion and the premise \nbased procedure, in line with discussions in Bovens and Rabinowicz (2006) and List \n(2006).  \nIf a group follows the conclusion based procedure, it simply votes on the conclusion, \nand disregards the premises. If the group follows the premise based procedure, it votes on \nthe premises and derives the conclusion by deductive closure. This will lead to different \nepistemic performances. I will show the diverging epistemic performances by discussing \nthe detective example as stated in table 2 above. The three proposition P , Q, R and their \nrespective negations are on the agenda. In addition, all individuals accept ( )P Q R\uf0d9 \uf0ab  as \ntrue8, and we assume it is true as a matter of fact. Therefore, the world can be in 4 different \nstates: \n                                                 \n8 Assuming that the normative proposition R refers to a fact. \n - 12 - \n \nS1 P Q R \nS2 P\uf0d8  Q R\uf0d8  \nS3 P Q\uf0d8  R\uf0d8  \nS4 P\uf0d8  Q\uf0d8  R\uf0d8  \n \n  \nLess technically, all propositions can be true, or one of the premises and the conclusion \nare false, or both premises and the conclusion are false. These are also the only logically \npossible complete, consistent and deductively closed judgement sets, since we accept \n( )P Q R\uf0d9 \uf0ab  as a background assumption.  \nFor now, let us assume that a decision is epistemically correct if and only if it produces \nthe correct stance on conclusion R (we discuss the idea that the stances on the premises \nshould also be true below). In a premise based procedure one votes only on the premises \nand deduces the conclusion. Therefore, the correct conclusion can be reached with \ndifferent collective judgements on the premises: \n \nState Conclusion Premise judgements with correct conclusion \nS1 R \uf07b \uf07d,P Q  \nS2 R\uf0d8  \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d, , , , ,P Q P Q P Q\uf0d8 \uf0d8 \uf0d8 \uf0d8  \nS3 R\uf0d8  \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d, , , , ,P Q P Q P Q\uf0d8 \uf0d8 \uf0d8 \uf0d8  \nS4 R\uf0d8  \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d, , , , ,P Q P Q P Q\uf0d8 \uf0d8 \uf0d8 \uf0d8  \n  \nThe point to note here is that the premise based procedure can lead to the right \nconclusion even if one or both collective judgements on the premises are wrong. One can \ntherefore be right for the wrong reasons. For instance, an agent can have the judgements P \nand \u00acQ  and therefore \u00acR, even though the world is in state where \u00acP and Q are true. The \nagent is right to hold \u00acR, but for the wrong reasons. If one wants the group to be right for \n\u201cthe right reasons\u201d (Bovens and Rabinowicz, 2006, p. 138f.), one should only consider \ncases where the collective judgements on both premises are correct, not only the \nconclusion derived from them.  \nI now turn to the conclusion based procedure. There are two distinct ways for \nindividuals to deal with a conclusion based system. Either each single individual takes their \njudgements on the premises and derives the conclusion. This is the way Bovens and \nRabinowicz propose. The conclusion based procedure leads to a correct judgement on the \n - 13 - \nconclusion if and only if a majority of individuals has the correct assessment of the \nconclusion. However, they may well have come to that assessment for the wrong reasons. \nFor instance, if the correct assessment of the conclusion is that R is false, one can arrive at \nthat conclusion from three different judgement sets on the two premises: \n\uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d, , , , ,P Q P Q P Q\uf0d8 \uf0d8 \uf0d8 \uf0d8  . Only one set of judgement can be the right one, but all lead \nto the correct judgement on the conclusion. Alternatively, the agents completely disregard \ntheir judgements on the premises and make judgements only on the conclusion. In this \ncase, the decision problem is collapsed into a decision on a single proposition, and the \nstandard Condorcet Jury Theorem formula (1) applies. This way is unattractive from an \nepistemic standpoint because it completely disregards the information the individuals have \non the premises. \nBovens and Rabinowicz calculate the probabilities for the group to make the right \njudgement on the conclusion, They consider four cases:  \n \n1. The use of the premise based procedure where all correct conclusions are counted.  \n2. The use of the premise based procedure where only judgements based on the right \nreasons are counted as correct.  \n3. The use of the conclusion based procedure where all correct conclusions are counted.  \n4. The use of the conclusion based procedure where conclusions are counted as correct \nif a majority of individuals has reached the correct judgement on the conclusion for \nthe right reason. \nThese calculations depend on parameters. In addition to the individual competence p and \nthe group size n, it also matters how likely the different states S1 to S4 are, which is \ndetermined by the prior probabilities of P , Q, and R . Let ( )P\uf070  be the prior probability \nthat P is true; ( )Q\uf070  be the prior probability that Q is true. This in turn determines \n( ) ( ) ( )R P Q\uf070 \uf070 \uf070\uf03d .  \nFigure 2 shows the results for the group competence, dependent on the individual \ncompetence p, for n = 101 , ( ) ( ) 0.5P Q\uf070 \uf070\uf03d \uf03d  and ( ) 0.25R\uf070 \uf03d . The two solid curves are \nthe results for the premise based procedure, the two dashed curves for the conclusion based \nprocedure. pbp is the result for the premise based procedure, pbp-rr for the premise based \nprocedure when only results with the right reasons are counted as correct. Similarly, cbp \nshows the result for the conclusion based procedure, cbp-rr the conclusion based procedure \nwith the correctness for the rights reason criterion. \n \n *** Figure 2 about here *** \n \n \nFirst, consider the results for 0.5p \uf0b3 , that is the results with the (usually) more \nplausible assumption that individuals tend to be at least as good as a coin toss in making \n - 14 - \ntheir decisions. For the premise based procedure, the group competence is 0.5 for p = 0.5, \nand then quickly approaches 1 for larger p . If being right for the right reason matters, the \ngroup competence starts from a lower level, but still approaches 1 quickly. The conclusion \nbased procedure starts from a higher level (0.75), but is quickly outperformed by the \npremise based procedure at a competence level of around 0.55. Interestingly, which \nprocedure performs better depends on the level of p. Unsurprisingly, the procedures that \ncare for being right for the right reasons have lower levels of collective competence. The \npremise based procedure for the right reasons performs better than the conclusion based \nprocedure for the right reasons.  \nNow consider the results for competence levels lower than 0.5. First, there is a range of \np for which the conclusion-based procedure fares better than the premise based procedure. \nSecond, the reliability of the premise based procedure dips for values that are close but \nbelow 0.5 for p.9 Third, if individuals are incompetent, they are very unlikely to be right \nfor the right reasons. Overall, results for competence levels of p < 0.5 are of less interest \nbecause it is implausible that individuals are systematically worse than a toin coss.  \nFigure 3 shows the results for the same group size, but with different prior probabilities, \nnamely ( ) ( ) 0.8P Q\uf070 \uf070\uf03d \uf03d  and consequently ( ) 0.64R\uf070 \uf03d . For these parameter values, the \npremise based procedure does better for all values p > 0.5. One can see that the \nperformance of the two procedures depends on the prior probabilities. Both procedures \nperform worse around p = 0.5 compared to figure 2, but the conclusion based procedure is \nstill stronger in an area below 0.5. \n \n \n \n *** Figure 3 about here *** \n \n \nList (2006, n. 25) criticizes the approach taken by Bovens and Rabinowicz because they \ndo not distinguish between positive and negative reliability.10 Positive reliability is the \nprobability that the group correctly identifies R as true, negative reliability the probability \nthat the group correctly identifies R as false. Different decision problems require different \nattention to the two reliabilities. Bovens and Rabinowicz simply calculate the probability \nthat the group is correct. This may be misleading. Intuitively, this can be seen in figure 2 \nby considering the performances of the different aggregation procedures with p = 0.5, i. e. \n                                                 \n9 This feature of the premise based procedure has been overlooked by Bovens and Rabinowicz (see figure \n6, where this dip is missing). The reason for this dip is quite easy to grasp intuitively: For very low p, the \npremise based procedure is reliably wrong on both premises. If the world is in state S1 or S4, it will \nproduce the wrong judgement on R, but if the world is in S2 or S3, it will produce the right outcome \n(though for the wrong reason, swapping the true and the false premise). As p approaches the watershed of \n0.5, the procedure is less reliable false. It is still very unlikely that it is correct about both premises, but it \nis occasionally correct on one of them. Being sometimes right on one conclusion produces better results if \nthe world is in S4, but worse results if the world is in either S2 or S3 (and it does not matter for S1). Since \nthe world is more often in either S2 or S3 than in S4, the performance of the premise based procedure \ndips for p close to but lower than 0.5.  \n10 List also operates with asymmetrical individual competence, that is individuals have different competence \nfor correctly judging true and false propositions. \n - 15 - \nwhen the individual competence is no better than a coin toss. An unbiased procedure \nshould then be able to pick out the right result in half of the cases. But the conclusion \nbased procedure is doing much better. This is because the conclusion based procedure has \na bias towards assuming that R is false. Since figure 2 is drawn for ( ) 0.25R\uf070 \uf03d , this bias \nplays to the advantage of the conclusion based formula. This result is due to a high \nnegative reliability and the fact that for the given prior probabilities the conclusion is more \noften false than true. However, this comes at the cost of a low positive reliability. Figure 3 \nshows that the premise based procedure is also biased for other parameter setting. Here \nboth procedures show a bias that is to their disadvantage. \nThe upshot of the epistemic analysis is that different procedures for aggregating \njudgements have different qualities to \u201ctrack the truth\u201d. These considerations show that a \nformal analysis of Goldman\u2019s \u201cknowledge challenge\u201d can help to decide which \naggregation rule to use. For the example analysed here, the premise based procedure \nperforms well in most situations where individuals are competent. With regard to \ndistributed thinking more generally, it is worthwhile exploring with formal models how \ndifferent systems of distributed thinking lead to different epistemic success. \n 4 Distributed and Consistent Thinking \nDistributed thinking can proceed in different ways. One way to conceptualize a distributed \nthinking system is to imagine a system where distributed non-thinking parts are connected \nin such a way that the whole assembly is a thinking system. A computer may be a \ndistributed thinking system in that weak sense. Each single transistor could be seen as a \nnon-thinking part, while the computer arranges these non-thinking parts in such a way that \nit can think, where thinking is taken as being able to solve logical problems. This notion of \na thinking system is too weak because any thinking system is distributed in that sense. \nBrains, for instance, could be seen a distributed thinking system made of neurons.  \nThe definition becomes more interesting if we assume that a distributed thinking system \nconsists of several thinking sub-units. This definition is better because it rules out single \ncomputers and (perhaps) single brains, but includes relevant cases like groups of several \nagents, networked systems, et cetera. The interesting aspect of a distributed thinking \nsystem defined like that is the potential tension between the individual and the collective \nthinking. Oftentimes this tension is productive. We talk (rather vaguely) of \u201cswarm \nintelligence\u201d or \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d, and we sometimes experience how group \ndeliberation can lead to better, more informed results than decisions by single individuals. \nBut this tension can also lead to breakdowns of \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d, when no \nagreement can be reached, when the outcomes are inconsistent, or just plain wrong. \nI have argued that judgement aggregation provides a useful framework for the analysis \nof distributed thinking. However, two anonymous referees argued that the judgement \naggregation framework does not connect with the concept of distributed thinking for at \nleast three reasons. First, judgement aggregation is not dynamic, in contrast to cognitive \ndistribution, which emphasizes the dynamic interaction between the thinking units. \nSecond, judgement aggregation does not engage with a central feature of the distributed \ncognition framework: the fact that minds and world interact, and that organisms reshape \n - 16 - \ntheir environment in order to solve cognitive problems. This claim is often referred to by \nclaiming that cognition happens \u201cin the wild\u201d. Third, the judgement aggregation \nframework allegedly attempts to reduce distributed thinking to the thinking of sub-units, \nand does not appreciate that distributed thinking arises because higher level structures \nemerge.  \nMy response is as follows. I largely concur with the first claim regarding the discursive \ndilemma, but point out that research in judgement aggregation raises interesting question \nabout the possible dynamics that avoid the described impossibility results. This answer is \nconnected with the second claim. While judgement aggregation per se does not address the \ninteraction between minds and environment, it does raise questions as to how agents \nrestructure their decision environment in order to avoid paradoxes like the discursive \ndilemma. Finally, I maintain that the validity of the third claim depends on the notion of \nemergence employed. In a weak sense, judgement aggregation and social choice theory \nsupport the claim that distributed thinking systems have emergent properties. I will now \naddress each objection in greater detail.  \nJudgement aggregation, at least in the simple versions discussed here, does not \nincorporate a dynamic change of judgements through an interaction of individual and \ngroup judgements.11 But the question of dynamics is raised indirectly by the impossibility \nresults mentioned above, since the impossibility results pose the question how the \nbreakdown of the aggregation process is avoided in practice. The discursive dilemma, for \nexample, only arises for some of the many possible judgement profiles. It is therefore \nconceivable that a dynamic process, especially a process of deliberation, reduces or \neradicates those profiles that lead to impossibility results. It is well known that the Arrow \nparadox can be avoided if the preference profile has certain structural properties, thereby \nrelaxing the universal domain axiom (Dryzek and List, 2003; Black, 1948). Similar results \nhold for judgement aggregation. In case of the discursive dilemma, a suitable restriction of \nthe universal domain axiom avoids the impossibility result (List and Pettit, 2002). \nEmpirical observations support the claim that deliberation leads to fewer occurences of the \ndiscursive dilemma (List et al., 2006).12 Thus, a dynamic process like deliberation may \nmitigate the occurence of the impossibility result, and the framework of judgement \naggregation raises interesting questions about the nature of the dynamic processes to avoid \na breakdown of collective rationality. I therefore claim that even a static analysis in terms \nof judgement aggregation provides the debate on distributed thinking with useful concepts \nto analyse the dynamic processes. \nThe charge that judgement aggregation fails to scrutinize cognition \u201cin the wild\u201d can \nalso be addressed by considering the escape routes to avoid impossibility results. Hutchins \n(1995) discusses several ways of how groups can structure their own decision making to \nsimplify it, among them hierarchy and consensus (p. 256\u2013259). Clark also emphasizes the \nimportance of \u201cbroader social and institutional contexts of action\u201d (p. 186). List and Pettit \nshow that if the individuals agree on a unidimensional alignment of the problem (similar to \n                                                 \n11 However, research on how the judgement aggregation framework pertains to the change of judgements is \nundertaken. See List, forthcomingb. \n12 In addition,Bonnefon (2007) reports that individuals change their preference for the conclusion and \npremise based procedure changes with the nature of the decision. \n - 17 - \na left-right dimension in party politics), the dilemma can be avoided, even though \nindividuals can disagree on their judgements. In addition, the dilemma disappears when the \ndecision is delegated to specialists for each proposition (a form of \u201clocal dictatorship\u201d), or \nwhen deliberation leads to a convergence of judgements. Thus, even though judgement \naggregation does not directly explore decision group thinking \u201cin the wild\u201d, the discussion \nof escape routes is very much concerned with the the dynamic interaction of individuals \nand their potential to restructure the decision problem.  \nFinally, I turn to the charge that judgement aggregation is reductionist and fails to do \njustice to the emergent properties of distributed thinking systems. This charge hinges on \nthe notion of emergence and reduction used. It is true that judgement aggregation is \ninterested in aggregating individual to collective judgements. But the central result of the \njudgement aggregation research programme is that the aggregation is non-trivial, and that \nthe group judgements cannot just be derived by summing up and counting the individual \njudgements. To underline this point, I use William Wimsatt\u2019s work on emergence and \nreduction. Wimsatt (1997) proposes a weak working definition for emergence: a system \nhas emergent properties if it fails to be aggregative. For Wimsatt, the ideal aggregative \nsystem is invariant with regard to changes of like-for-like components, it scales linearly in \nsize, the system properties are invariant with regard to a decomposition or reaggregation of \nthe system, and there is no positive or negative interaction among the parts of the system. \nFor instance, a heap of sugar is aggregative with regard to its mass. I can exchange one \ngramm of sugar for another gramm and its mass remains the same. If I add 1 gramm of \nsugar, the total mass increases by 1 gramm. If I divide the heap of sugar in two piles, the \ntwo piles each have half the mass of the original heap. If I put the heaps together again, I \nobtain the same mass. Finally, if I had two different types of sugar (brown and white sugar, \nsay), this would not lead to positive or negative interactions in terms of the mass of the two \ntypes. Most systems are not entirely aggregative. For Wimsatt, the less aggregative a \nsystem is with regard to its properties, the more emergent properties it has.  \nSince the results presented above show that judgements on logically connected \npropositions cannot always be aggregated, given the stated axioms, such a system has \nemergent properties in Wimsatt\u2019s weak sense. One central result of the judgement \naggregation research programme is that the sentence \u201cA collective judgement of a group \non a set of logically connected propositions is nothing but the aggregation of individual \njudgements\u201d is not trivially true, since the aggregation encounters impossibility results. \nThe results from judgement aggregation thus casts doubt on a simple \u201cnothing but\u201d \nreduction of group judgements, and weak emergence in Wimsatt\u2019s sense is embraced. For \nWimsatt, \u201c[a]n emergent property is\u2014roughly\u2014a system property which is dependent on \nthe mode of the organization of the system\u2019s parts\u201d (1997, p. S373, italics omitted). In this \nsense, the process of judgement aggregation has at least weak emergent properties. \nWhether this weak notion of emergence is enough to be of interest for the distributed \ncognition framework is a further question I leave to others. But I agree with Poirier and \nChicoisne (2008) that the borders of distributed cognition are fuzzy.  \nJudgement aggregation as a field (in the simple treatments as discussed above) shows \nthat even very simple reasoning processes run into difficulties when trying to turn rational \nindividual judgements on logically connected propositions to rational collective \n - 18 - \njudgements. If these problems arise even for the fairly simple problems like the discursive \ndilemma, one can anticipate similar and more difficult problems once one moves to more \ncomplicated settings. The basic lesson from the discursive dilemma is that the decision on \nthe best processes applied in distributed thinking involves trade-offs between different \nproperties of the reasoning process. Some processes are clearly worse than others, but \nwhen it comes to the best processes, different considerations need to be weighed against \neach other.  \nOne possible consideration is the epistemic success of the procedures, i. e. the ability of \nthe distributed thinking system to \u201ctrack the truth\u201d. It is interesting to note that, for \ninstance, in the comparison of the premise and the conclusion based procedure, it depends \non the context of the decision problem which procedure performs best. However, if we \nintroduce the additional requirement that the procedure must reach the correct decision for \nthe right reasons, then the premise based procedure is the clear winner in the example \ndiscussed. Being right for the right reasons can also be important if the group has to justify \nits decisions, or if the reasoning the group applies will be adopted or imitated in future \nreasoning processes.  \nMany extensions of the simple examples discussed in this paper are possible. One \nshould explore more complex decision problems, different logical dependencies, cases \nwith incomplete judgement sets, the heterogeneous competence levels, or settings where \ncertain types of judgement errors are worse than others. Most of these questions have \nalready been addressed in the literature on judgement aggregation and information pooling. \nThe emerging literature on distributed thinking can benefit from the analytical and \nnormative debates in these areas.  \n \n Appendix \nBovens and Rabinowicz (2006) calculate the probabilities of the group being correct, \nconditional on the state. They define pbpM  as the proposition \u2018The premise based \nprocedure yields the correct result\u2019 and calculate probabilities conditional on all 4 states:  \n2\n2 2\n2\n( | S1) ( , ) ,\n( | S2) ( , ) ( , )(1 ( , )) (1 ( , )) ,\n( | S3) ( | S2),\n( | S4) ( , ) 2 ( , )(1 ( , )).\npbp CJT\npbp CJT CJT CJT CJT\npbp pbp\npbp CJT CJT CJT\nP M P n p\nP M Pr n p P n p P n p P n p\nP M P M\nP M P n p P n p P n p\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02b \uf02d \uf02b \uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf02b \uf02d\n (2) \n  \n \nNote that one can arrive at the correct result even though some or even both collective \njudgements on the premises are wrong.

Since each single voter applies deductive closure, we obtain \nthe following probabilities for each single voter to be correct on the conclusion, based on \ntheir competence p:  \n \n \n2\n2 2\n2\n( | S1)\n( | S2) ( | 3) (1 ) (1 )\n( | S4) 2 (1 ).\nP V p\nP V P V S p p p p\nP V p p p\n\uf03d\n\uf03d \uf03d \uf02b \uf02d \uf02b \uf02d\n\uf03d \uf02b \uf02d\n (4) \n \nEach individual can reach the correct conclusion by being correct on both premises \n(probability 2p ) but one can also be correct, even if one is wrong on one or even both of \nthe premises. Let cbpM  denote the proposition that the conclusion based procedure yields \nthe correct result. Conditional on the state, we can apply equation 1 to calculate the \nprobability of a correct majority vote on the conclusion:  \n \n( | S ) ( , ( | S )).cbp CJTP M i P n P V i\uf03d  (5) \n \nSumming up the probabilities weighted by the prior probabilities of the different states \nyields:  \n \n \n( ) ( | 1) ( ) ( ) ( | 2)(1 ( )) ( )\n( | 3) ( )(1 ( )) ( | 4)(1 ( ))(1 ( )).\ncbp cbp cbp\ncbp cbp\nP M P M S P Q P M S P Q\nP M S P Q P M S P Q\n\uf070 \uf070 \uf070 \uf070\n\uf070 \uf070 \uf070 \uf070\n\uf03d \uf02b \uf02d\n\uf02b \uf02d \uf02b \uf02d \uf02d\n (6) \n \nThe results for the premise based procedure in (6) and the conclusion based procedure \nin (11) are based on the assumption that it does not matter whether the correct result is \ndeduced from correct or incorrect judgements on the premises. If we want to be right \u201cfor \nthe right reasons\u201d, the cases where incorrect judgements lead to correct outcomes need to \nbe removed.
