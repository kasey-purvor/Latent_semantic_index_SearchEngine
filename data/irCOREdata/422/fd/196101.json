PhIP has been \nshown to induce tumours in the colon, prostate and mammary glands of rats and is regarded as a \npotential human dietary carcinogen. PhIP is metabolically activated via cytochrome P450 \nmediated oxidation to an N-hydroxylamino-PhIP intermediate that is subsequently converted to \nan ester by N-acetyltransferases or sulfotransferases and undergoes heterolytic cleavage to \nproduce a PhIP-nitrenium ion, which reacts with DNA to form the N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-\namino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP-C8-dG) adduct. Thus far, the detection \nand quantification of PhIP-DNA adducts has relied to a large extent on 32P-postlabelling \nmethodologies. In order to expand the array of available techniques for the detection and \nimproved quantification of PhIP-C8-dG adducts in DNA we have developed an online column-\nswitching liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry \n(MS\/MS) selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method incorporating an isotopically [13C10]-\nlabelled PhIP-C8-dG internal standard for the analysis of DNA enzymatically hydrolysed to 2'-\ndeoxynucleosides. A dose-dependent increase was observed for PhIP-C8-dG adducts when \nsalmon testis DNA was reacted with N-acetoxy-PhIP. Analysis of DNA samples isolated from \ncolon tissue of mice treated by oral gavage daily for 5 days with 50 mg\/kg body weight of PhIP \nresulted in the detection of an average level of 14.8 \u00b1 3.7 PhIP-C8-dG adducts per 106 2'-\ndeoxynucleosides. The method required 50 \u00b5g of hydrolysed animal DNA on column and the \nlimit of detection for PhIP-C8-dG was 2.5 fmol (1.5 PhIP-C8-dG adducts per 108 2\u2032-\ndeoxynucleosides). In summary, the LC-ESI-MS\/MS SRM method provides for the rapid \nautomation of the sample clean up and a reduction in matrix components that would otherwise \n 4 \ninterfere with the mass spectrometric analysis, with sufficient sensitivity and precision to analyse \nDNA adducts in animals exposed to PhIP. \n \n 5 \nIntroduction \n \nThe heterocyclic aromatic amine (HAA), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-\nb]pyridine (PhIP) is formed following the pyrolysis of amino acids and reaction with sugars in \nthe presence of creatine\/creatinine during the grilled cooking of certain foods, such as meats, \npoultry and fish [1-5]. PhIP represents one of the most abundantly formed of more than 20 \nHAAs that have been shown to be mutagenic in bacterial assays as well as mammalian cells \n[3,5]. The carcinogenic properties of HAAs have been demonstrated in rodent bioassays \nfollowing long-term feeding studies [6]. PhIP has been found to induce tumours in the colon, \nprostate and mammary glands of rats, which represent the principal sites that are associated with \nhuman dietary related cancer implying that it could be a human carcinogen [3,4,7-9]. The \nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified PhIP as a group 2B \ncarcinogen (possibly carcinogenic to humans) [10]. \nThe genotoxicity of PhIP is related to metabolic activation resulting in an electrophilic \nspecies that is capable of generating covalent DNA adducts [1]. PhIP undergoes an initial \noxidation step to an N-hydroxylamino-PhIP intermediate which is mediated by cytochrome \n(CYP) P450 enzymes, primarily by CYP1A2 in humans [11-13]. Subsequent metabolism by N-\nacetyltransferases (NAT) or sulfotransferases (SULT) converts the N-hydroxylamino-PhIP into \nan ester capable of undergoing heterolytic cleavage to produce a PhIP-nitrenium ion, which is \nthe ultimate reactive species that reacts with DNA (Scheme 1) [5,13,14]. The major covalent \nDNA adduct detected in vivo resulting from the exposure of experimental animals and humans to \nPhIP is N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP-C8-\ndG) [14,15]. \n 6 \nNumerous methods have been developed for the detection of PhIP-derived DNA adducts, which \ninclude 32P-Postlabelling in combination with thin layer chromatography (TLC) or high \nperformance liquid chromatography [16-20], immunological methods [7,9], gas \nchromatography-mass spectrometry following alkaline hydrolysis of PhIP adducts to the parent \namine [21,22] and accelerator mass spectrometry [23-25]. 32P-Postlabelling has been the most \nwidely used method for the detection of PhIP-DNA adducts in animal and human tissues offering \nthe advantage that only small amounts of DNA are required for analysis. The development of \nelectrospray ionization (ESI) has permitted the coupling of liquid chromatography (LC) to mass \nspectrometry (MS), which has been used for the detection of numerous DNA adducts [26]. LC-\nmass spectrometry has made sufficient gains in sensitivity for the detection of DNA adducts \nresulting in it being a viable alternative to other detection methods such as 32P-postlabelling and \nimmunoassays, to provide more accurate and precise results through the use of stable isotope \ninternal standards [27,28]. Recently, LC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) methods using \ndeuterated stable isotope internal standards and off-line pre-purification of the PhIP-C8-dG \nadduct using solid phase extraction or online column-switching LC have been described for the \ndetection and quantitation of adducts in cells and DNA treated in vitro with PhIP, and also in the \nliver and colon of rats treated in vivo with PhIP [20,22,29-31]. Mass spectrometry based methods \noffer a number of advantages with respect to the identification and quantitation of DNA adducts, \nas they rely on the detection of adduct-specific ions and characteristic transitions of the ions \nbeing monitored, respectively, and because quantification is based upon the use of isotopically-\nlabelled internal standards. \nWe describe the development of a method involving online column-switching LC-\nMS\/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for the determination of PhIP-C8-dG in DNA \n 7 \nthat has been enzymatically hydrolysed to 2'-deoxynucleosides. This newly developed method \nallows for the rapid automation of the sample clean up and a reduction in matrix components that \nwould otherwise interfere with the mass spectrometric analysis. We applied this method to the \ndetection of PhIP-C8-dG adducts in DNA samples from salmon testis DNA treated with different \nconcentrations of N-acetoxy-PhIP in vitro and DNA obtained from mouse colon tissue following \ndosing with PhIP. \n \n 8 \nExperimental Procedures \n \nChemicals and Reagents \n \nPhIP was acquired from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada), and \n[13C10]-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). \nAll other reagents used in the preparation of the DNA adduct standards and in vitro modified \nDNA samples were of the highest available purity and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, \nMO). Caution: PhIP and its derivatives are mutagens and carcinogens and should be handled \nwith care. Protective clothing should be worn and appropriate safety procedures followed when \nworking with these compounds. Salmon testis DNA, deoxyribonuclease I (from bovine \npancreas), snake venom phosphodiesterase I (from Crotalus adamanteus), alkaline phosphatase \n(from E. coli) and mass spectrometry grade formic acid were purchased from Sigma (Poole, \nUK). HPLC grade water, 18.2 M\u2126cm output quality was obtained from Maxima purification \nequipment (Elga, High Wycombe, UK). All other reagents (analytical grade) and HPLC grade \nacetonitrile were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK). \n \nSynthesis of N-acetoxy-2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-acetoxy-\nPhIP)  \n2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (N-hydroxylamino-PhIP) was \nprepared as described previously, by diazotization of PhIP and reaction with sodium nitrite \nfollowed by catalytic reduction of the nitro derivative thus obtained with Pd\/C to the N-\nhydroxylamine. [32] The hydroxylamine was acetylated as described previously to afford N-\n 9 \nacetoxy-PhIP. [14] Given the expected instability of N-acetoxy-PhIP, it was used without any \nfurther purification. \n \nPreparation of unlabelled and isotopically labelled N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-amino-1-\nmethyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine adduct standards \nThe PhIP-C8-dG adduct standards were prepared as described previously [14], by reacting the \ncrude acetylation mixtures containing N-acetoxy-PhIP with solutions of 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine or \n[13C10]-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine. Unlabelled and [13C10]-labelled PhIP-C8-dG thus obtained were \npurified by reverse-phase HPLC [14]. The identity and purity of the unlabelled PhIP-C8-dG was \nconfirmed by 1H NMR and ESI-MS\/MS (data not shown). The adduct standard solutions were \nquantified by UV spectrophotometry, based upon an extinction coefficient of \u03b5 = 33,300 M-1cm-1 \nat \u03bbmax 360 nm. [22] \n \nPreparation of salmon testis DNA samples modified in vitro with N-acetoxy-2-amino-1-\nmethyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine \nA range of DNA samples with different levels of in-vitro modification were prepared by \nadding serial 10-fold dilutions of N-acetoxy-PhIP in THF to solutions of salmon testis DNA (1 \nmg\/mL in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). The estimated concentrations of the N-acetoxy-\nPhIP in the reaction mixtures ranged from ca. 0.0001 mg\/mL to 0.1 mg\/mL. The reaction \nmixtures were incubated overnight at 37\u00baC, extracted with 1 volume of ethyl acetate then 1 \nvolume of water-saturated n-butanol, and then DNA was precipitated by addition of 0.1 volume \nof 5 M NaCl and 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. DNA samples were centrifuged, the pellets thus \nobtained were washed twice with 5 mL of ice-cold ethanol\/water (70:30, v\/v) and the residues \n 10 \nfinally obtained upon centrifugation were redissolved in 5 mM BisTris buffer, pH 7.1, 0.1 mM \nEDTA, allowing an overnight rehydration at 4\u00baC before freezing the samples at \u221280\u00baC until \nfurther use. The DNA concentrations in the final solutions were determined by UV \nspectrophotometry. \n \nEnzymatic hydrolysis of in vitro modified salmon testis DNA for LC-ESI-MS\/MS analysis  \nEach of the in vitro modified salmon testis DNA samples (400 \u00b5g) was evaporated to \ndryness using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator. The dried DNA samples were dissolved in 990 \n\u00b5L of 50 mM BisTris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.1 buffer plus 10 \u00b5L of 1 M MgCl2 and incubated \nwith 100 \u00b5L of deoxyribonuclease I (2 mg\/mL dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) at \n37\u00baC for 6 h. The samples were further incubated with 80 \u00b5L of snake venom phosphodiesterase \nI from Crotalus adamanteus (0.001 U\/\u00b5L dissolved in 0.11 M Tris-HCl, 0.11 M NaCl, 15 mM \nMgCl2, pH 8.9) and 26.2 \u00b5L of alkaline phosphatase from E. coli (0.305 U\/\u00b5L) at 37\u00baC for 15 h. \nThe hydrolysed DNA samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min and the supernatants \ntransferred to new microfuge tubes for storage at \u221280\u00baC. Aliquots of the hydrolysed DNA \nsamples were removed to which were added 1333.3 fmol of the [13C10]-labelled PhIP-C8-dG \ninternal standard (100 fmol\/\u00b5L) and evaporated to dryness using a centrifugal vacuum \nevaporator. The dried samples were dissolved in 20 \u00b5L of HPLC grade water\/methanol (80:20, \nv\/v), centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min and transferred to HPLC vials with low volume inserts. \nA 15 \u00b5L aliquot of each sample was injected on to the online column switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS, \nequivalent to 5 or 10 \u00b5g of hydrolysed DNA depending on the extent of modification by PhIP \nwith 1000 fmol of the [13C10]-labelled PhIP-C8-dG internal standard on column. \n \n 11 \nTreatment of animals  \nPorlox\/lox\/CreCYP1A1 mice on a C57BL\/6 background (Reductase Inducible Cre, RIC) were \nbred in-house at the Biomedical Research Institute, Dundee [33]. In these mice the cytochrome \nP450 oxidoreductase (Por) gene can be deleted tissue-specifically after the administration of \nchemical inducers (e.g. 3-methylcholanthrene) of CYP1A1. However, in the absence of the \nchemical inducer (as in the present study), these mice are phenotypically normal and \nindistinguishable from wild-type animals. Adult female RIC mice, > 3 weeks old, were dosed by \noral gavage daily for 5 days with 50 mg\/kg body weight of PhIP dissolved in corn oil. Control \nanimals were dosed with corn oil alone. Animals were sacrificed and the colon tissue was \nremoved. DNA isolation was performed by using standard phenol\/chloroform extraction. All \nanimal experiments were carried out under license in accordance with the law, and following \nlocal ethical review. \n \nEnzymatic hydrolysis of animal DNA for LC-ESI-MS\/MS analysis \nPrior to enzymatic digestion 1333.3 fmol of the [13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard (100 \nfmol\/\u03bcL) was added to 66.7 \u00b5g of the mouse DNA samples and evaporated to dryness using a \ncentrifugal vacuum evaporator. The dried DNA samples were dissolved in 99 \u00b5L of 50 mM \nBisTris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.1 buffer plus 1.0 \u00b5L of 1 M MgCl2 and incubated with 10 \u00b5L of \ndeoxyribonuclease I (2 mg\/mL dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) at 37\u00baC for 6 h. The \nsamples were further incubated with 6.0 \u00b5L of snake venom phosphodiesterase I from Crotalus \nadamanteus (0.001 U\/\u00b5L dissolved in 0.11 M Tris-HCl, 0.11 M NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, pH 8.9) \nand 3.18 \u00b5L of alkaline phosphatase from E. coli (0.315 U\/\u00b5L) at 37\u00baC for 15 h. The hydrolysed \nDNA samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min and the supernatant transferred to a new \n 12 \neppendorf tube and then evaporated to dryness using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator. The dried \nsamples were dissolved in 20 \u00b5L of HPLC grade water\/methanol (80:20, v\/v) and transferred to \nHPLC vials with low volume inserts. A 15 \u00b5L aliquot of each sample, equivalent to 50 \u00b5g of \nhydrolysed DNA and 1000 fmol of the [13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard on column was \ninjected on to the online column switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS. \n \nOnline column-switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS analysis \nThe online column switching valve system consisted of an automated switching valve \n(motorized two-position six-port valve, Waters Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) connected to pump A \nincorporating an autosampler (Waters Alliance 2695 separations module with a 100 \u00b5L injection \nloop) and an isocratic pump B (Gynotek GmbH, Germering, Germany). Pump A was connected \nvia the switching valve to the trap column, a Synergi Fusion-RP 80A C18, 4 \u00b5m, 30 \u00d7 2.0 mm \ncolumn attached to a KrudKatcher disposable pre-column (0.5 \u00b5m) filter (Phenomenex, \nMacclesfield, UK) and Pump B was connected via the switching valve to the analytical column, \na Synergi Fusion-RP 80A C18 (4 \u00b5m, 250 \u00d7 2.0 mm) column attached to a Synergi Fusion-RP \n80A C18 (4 \u00b5m, 4.0 \u00d7 2.0 mm) guard column and KrudKatcher disposable pre-column (0.5 \u00b5m) \nfilter. The outlet of the analytical column was directly connected to the mass spectrometer. The \nconfiguration of the online column switching valve system is summarised in Figure 1. \nSample loading: A 15-\u00b5L aliquot of the in vitro modified (equivalent to 5 or 10 \u00b5g of \nhydrolysed DNA) or animal (equivalent to 50 \u00b5g of hydrolysed DNA) DNA sample containing \n1000 fmol of [13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard was injected onto the trap column using pump \nA with the switching valve in position 1. The impurities on the trap column were eluted to waste \nusing a gradient with solvent A, 0.1% formic acid\/HPLC grade water (0.1:99.9, v\/v) and solvent \n 13 \nB, 0.1% formic acid\/acetonitrile (0.1:99.9, v\/v) at a flow rate of 120 \u00b5L\/min. The following \ngradient was used: 0 min\u201315%B, 5 min\u201315%B, 15 min\u201365%B, 24 min\u201365%B, 24.1 min\u201315%B, \n40 min\u201315%B. Concurrently isocratic flow at 120 \u00b5L\/min via the analytical column, which was \neluted with 0.1% formic acid\/acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) (75:25, v\/v), was maintained to the \nmass spectrometer by means of pump B. \nSample elution: At 12.0 min the switching valve was switched to position 2 allowing the \npurified PhIP-C8-dG adduct to be back-flushed from the trap column onto the analytical column \nand then subsequent elution into the mass spectrometer. The isocratic flow was maintained by \npump B at flow rate of 120 \u00b5L\/min with 0.1% formic acid\/ acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) \n(75:25, v\/v) for 12.0 min. Concurrently the flow from pump A bypassed the trap column and was \ndiverted directly to waste. At 24.0 min the switching valve was switched back to position 1 and \nthe configuration of the online column switching system reverted back to initial conditions as \ndescribed for the sample loading above. The total run time was 40 min. \nMass spectrometry: A Waters Micromass Quattro Ultima Pt (Micromass, Waters Ltd., \nManchester, UK) tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray interface was used. \nThe temperature of the electrospray source was maintained at 120\u00baC and the desolvation \ntemperature at 350\u00baC. Nitrogen gas was used as the desolvation gas (650 L\/h) and the cone gas \n(25 L\/h). The capillary voltage was set at 3.20V. The cone and RF1 lens voltages were 42 V and \n15 V, respectively. The collision gas was argon (indicated cell pressure 2.0 \u00d7 10-3 mbar) and the \ncollision energy set at 12 eV. The dwell time was set to 200 ms and the resolution was two m\/z \nunits at peak base. The mass spectrometer was tuned by using a standard solution of PhIP-C8-dG \n(10 pmol\/\u00b5L) in 0.1% formic acid\/acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) (75:25, v\/v) introduced by \ncontinuous infusion at a flow rate of 10 \u00b5L\/min with a Harvard model 22 syringe pump (Havard \n 14 \nApparatus Ltd., Edenbridge, UK). The hydrolysed DNA samples were analysed in positive ESI \nMS\/MS selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode for the [M+H]+ ion to base [B+H2]+ \ntransitions of m\/z 490 to 374 for PhIP-C8-dG and m\/z 500 to 379 for [13C10]PhIP-C8-dG. The \nlevel of the adduct in the DNA samples was determined from the ratio of peak area of the \n[13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard.  \n \nCalibration curve for PhIP-C8-dG adducts with DNA matrix \nThe calibration curvess were constructed by the addition of different amounts of the \nunlabelled PhIP-C8-dG standards (ranging from 2.0 to 4000 fmol) plus 1000 fmol of the \n[13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard to 50 \u00b5g of enzymatically hydrolysed calf thymus DNA as \nthe matrix. The standards were subjected to the online column switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS \nanalysis procedure as described above. \n \n 15 \nResults \nValidation of the online column switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS analysis \nAccurate DNA adduct quantitation by mass spectrometry is best achieved by coupling \nselected reaction monitoring (SRM) with the use of stable isotope-labelled internal standards. \nMass spectrometric analysis of the [13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard was performed in \npositive mode LC-ESI-MS\/MS using the trap column only and resulted in a typical product ion \nspectrum that is normally observed for adducted 2\u2032 -deoxynucleosides following the neutral loss \n(121 u) of the [13C5]-labelled 2\u2032-deoxyribose moiety. The 13C-labelled atoms were equally \ndistributed between the adducted base and 2\u2032-deoxyribose moiety of the molecule as shown in \nFigure 2. The collision induced dissociation (CID) product ion mass spectrum consisted of the \nadducted base as being the most abundant product ion formed from the [M+H]+ ion at m\/z 500. \nThe adducted base product ion [B+H2]+ at m\/z 379 was formed by the cleavage of the glycosidic \nbond and the accompanied proton transfer from the 2\u2032 -deoxyribose moiety to the adducted base \n(Figure 2). A similar fragmentation pattern with the m\/z decreased by 5 for the adducted base \nproduct ion [B+H2]+ was observed for the corresponding unlabelled PhIP-C8-dG standard \n[M+H]+ ion. [13C10]PhIP-C8-dG was chemically pure as determined by HPLC-UV and no \nunlabelled adduct was detectable in the isotopic standard solutions as determined by LC-ESI-\nMS\/MS SRM. \nInitial experiments involved optimisation of the mobile phase conditions for the \nseparation of the PhIP-C8-dG adduct on the trap column from unmodified 2'-deoxynucleosides \nand matrix impurities. A gradient mobile phase system consisting of 0.1% formic acid and \nacetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) was found to give the optimal separation on the trap column with \na retention time of 14.16 min for PhIP-C8-dG. The online column switching valve system was \n 16 \nconfigured as shown in Figure 1 and the switching valve was switched to position 2 at 12.0 min \nfollowing injection of the hydrolysed DNA sample. This allowed for unmodified 2\u2032 -\ndeoxynucleosides plus any other matrix impurities that may have been present to be eluted to \nwaste while the PhIP-C8-dG adduct was back-flushed onto the analytical column for analysis by \nthe mass spectrometer. \nA typical online column-switching LC-MS\/MS calibration curve for the detection of \nPhIP-C8-dG is shown in Figure 3. The calibration curve was obtained by adding different \namounts of the PhIP-C8-dG standard with 1000 fmol of the [13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard \nto 50 \u00b5g of enzymatically hydrolysed calf thymus DNA to account for any matrix effects.. A \nlinear response over the range from 2.5 to 4000 fmol, corresponding to 1.5 to 2,469.1 adducts per \n108 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides (Figure 3), was obtained for the detection of PhIP-C8-dG with a \ncorrelation coefficient (r) of 0.9998 (y = 0.001x-0.0008). The limit of detection on column of the \nmethod was 2.5 fmol (S\/N = 3) corresponding to 1.5 PhIP-C8-dG adducts per 108 2\u2032-\ndeoxynucleosides and the lower limit of quantitation was 10.0 fmol (S\/N = 8) obtained by \nspiking the PhIP-C8-dG adduct and the labelled internal standard into calf thymus DNA (50 \u00b5g) \nenzymatic hydrolysate. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation of the online column-\nswitching LC-ESI-MS\/MS method, which were obtained following the analysis of calf thymus \nspiked with 25, 100 and 1000 fmol of the PhIP-C8-dG standard are shown in Table 1. The \naverage accuracy of the method, determined by spiking known amounts (2.5 to 4000 fmol) of the \nPhIP-C8-dG adduct and 1000 fmol of the [13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard in calf thymus \nDNA enzymatic hydrolysate was 100.2%. \n \n 17 \nOnline column switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS analysis of in vitro modified and animal DNA \nsamples \n \nSalmon testis DNA was incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight with solutions of N-acetoxy-PhIP. \nThe typical online column-switching LC-MS\/MS SRM ion chromatograms obtained for the \ndetermination of PhIP-C8-dG adducts in control (untreated) DNA and salmon testis DNA treated \nwith 0.001mg\/mL of N-acetoxy-PhIP are shown in Figure 4A and B, respectively. A linear \ndose-dependent increase was observed for the levels of PhIP-C8-dG adducts detected in salmon \ntestis DNA following exposure to levels of N-acetoxy-PhIP ranging from 0.0001 to 0.1 mg\/mL \n(Figure 5). The levels of PhIP-C8-dG adducts observed for the different DNA samples and the \nintra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for the analyses are shown in Table 2. The typical \nonline column-switching LC-MS\/MS ion chromatograms obtained for a mouse colon DNA \nsample is shown in Figure 4C for a control animal that was treated with the vehicle (corn oil) \nalone and Figure 4D shows the typical ion chromatogram obtained following the daily oral \ndosing of a mouse with 50 mg\/kg body weight of PhIP for 5 days. The average level of PhIP-C8-\ndG adducts detected in colon DNA from three animals treated under these conditions was 14.8 \u00b1 \n3.7 PhIP-C8-dG adducts per 106 2'-deoxynucleosides. \n \n 18 \nDiscussion \nIn the present study we have described the development of an online column-switching \nLC-ESI-MS\/MS SRM method that is suitable for the routine detection and quantification of \nPhIP-derived DNA adducts formed in vivo. Mass spectrometry offers great potential when \napplied to the detection and quantification of DNA adducts due to its very high sensitivity and \nchemical specificity, which allows the identification of specific DNA adducts in complex \nbiological matrices. The advantage of using online column-switching LC is that an enzymatically \nhydrolysed DNA sample can be analysed directly without the requirement for off-line pre-\npurification such as solid phase extraction of the DNA adduct, from the vast excess of \nunmodified 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides that could potentially interfere with the analysis. The PhIP-C8-\ndG adduct is retained on a trap (enrichment) column while unmodified 2\u2032 -deoxynucleosides are \neluted to waste. Following elution of the unmodified 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides as well as any matrix \nimpurities that may cause concomitant ionisation suppression, the switching valve diverts the \nflow from the trap column into the analytical column, which is connected to the mass \nspectrometer. We have previously applied a similar approach for the determination of DNA \nadducts derived from reactive oxygen species, acetaldehyde and 3-nitrobenzanthrone [28,34,35]. \nInterferences from the matrix may result in poor sensitivity by competition for charge, or \nincreased droplet viscosity and surface tension from high concentrations of co-eluting interfering \ncompounds for the formation of gas phase ions in the electrospray source [36]. The addition of \n[13C10]PhIP-C8-dG internal standard prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA samples allowed \nfor the accurate quantification of the adduct and also provided confirmation of the identity of the \nanalyte peak since it eluted at the identical retention time as the unlabelled PhIP-C8-dG. The 13C-\nlabelled stable isotope internal standard affords the advantage, when compared to deuterium \n 19 \nlabelled internal standards, that it is not subject to isotope (eg. deuterium-hydrogen) exchange. \nFurthermore the fragmentation properties of deuterated compounds may be different from the \ncorresponding natural isotope abundance containing compounds due to the more stable nature of \nthe C-D covalent bond in relation to the C-H bond. Therefore, the accurate quantitation of the \nanalyte may require the determination of a response factor to correct for this difference in \nfragmentation [37]. For both the PhIP-C8-dG adduct and the corresponding stable isotope \ninternal standard SRM transitions were used for the [M+H]+ ion to adducted base product ion \n[B+H2]+ formed by the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. SRM offers the greatest sensitivity due \nto decreased solvent and matrix interferences, and increased specificity due to the monitoring of \na characteristic fragmentation following CID of the compound being investigated. Initial method \nvalidation was performed by the construction of calibration curves following the spiking of \nPhIP-C8-dG into calf thymus DNA within a range of 2.5 to 4000 fmol. The method presented \ngood statistical performance with average intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 4.9 \nand 5.6%, respectively. The estimated LOD and LOQ was 2.5 and 10 fmol on column for PhIP-\nC8-dG, respectively. These values correspond to a LOD and LOQ of 1.5 and 6.2 PhIP-C8-dG \nadducts per 108 deoxynucleosides in a 50 \u00b5g DNA sample, respectively. \nIn order to develop the online column-switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS method for the \ndetection and quantification of PhIP derived DNA adducts formed in vivo, salmon testis DNA \nsamples were treated with different concentrations of the reactive metabolite N-acetoxy-PhIP \nranging from 0.0001 to 0.1 mg\/mL. A dose-dependent increase was observed for PhIP-C8-dG \nadducts following reaction of salmon testis DNA with N-acetoxy-PhIP. The levels ranged from \n5.5 to 2728.2 PhIP-C8-dG adducts per 106 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides. The average intra- and inter-\nassay coefficients of variation for the analysis of these samples were 3.3 and 5.3%, respectively. \n 20 \nAnalysis of DNA samples isolated from colon tissue of mice treated by oral gavage daily for 5 \ndays with 50mg\/kg body weight of PhIP resulted in the detection of an average level of 14.8 \u00b1 \n3.7 PhIP-C8-dG adducts per 106 2'-deoxynucleosides. No PhIP-C8-dG adducts were detected in \ncontrol animals dosed with corn oil alone. Previous studies have shown higher levels of PhIP-\nC8-dG adducts are detected in colon tissue when compared to the liver, which is consistent with \nthe colon being the target tissue for tumour development [29,30]. \nIn the past detection and quantification of PhIP DNA adducts has relied to a large extent \non the 32P-postlabelling technique [16-18]. The limitations of 32P-postlabelling are that it does \nnot provide structural confirmation of the adduct being detected and lacks the incorporation of an \ninternal standard to account for adduct recovery and labelling efficiencies. Furthermore 32P-\npostlabelling of HAA-DNA adducts has resulted in considerable inter-laboratory variation in the \npatterns of adduct spots detected following TLC separation making the interpretation of the \nresults very difficult. It has been suggested that the majority of the additional spots observed \ncorrespond to adducted oligonucleotides as consequence of partial enzymatic hydrolysis of the \nDNA [16]. The online column-switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS SRM method described here would \nrequire higher amounts of DNA for the analysis of human samples exposed to dietary levels of \nPhIP and is generally less sensitive when compared to 32P-postlabelling methods. However, it \npresents the clear advantages of providing accurate quantitation with information on the \nchemical identity of the adduct and constitutes a more automated and faster analytical method. \nPresently accelerator mass spectrometry represents the most sensitive method for the detection of \nDNA adducts at levels normally encountered in human biomonitoring studies and allows dosing \nwith HAAs at dose levels comparable to those found in the diet [23-25]. However the technique \nis disadvantaged by the requirement of dosing with 3H- or 14C-labelled carcinogens which is not \n 21 \namenable for general human population based studies and does not provide any structural \ninformation [23-25]. The use of capillary- or nano-LC coupled to micro- or nanoelectrospray \nionisation mass spectrometry in theory should provide for improvements in sensitivity and allow \nthe detection of PhIP-C8-dG adducts in animal and human samples following dietary levels of \nexposure to PhIP. \nIn conclusion, we have developed an online column-switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS SRM \nmethod with sufficient sensitivity and precision for the analysis of PhIP-C8-dG adducts formed \nin in-vitro experiments and in-vivo animal studies. \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors acknowledge financial support from the European Union Network of \nExcellence ECNIS, Type B project (Environmental Cancer Risk, Nutrition and Individual \nSusceptibility, www.ecnis.org, Contract No. FOOD-CT-2005-513943) and from Cancer \nResearch UK (CRUK project grant C6048\/A10896).
