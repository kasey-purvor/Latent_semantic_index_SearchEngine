These are based on the Al-Zn-Mg-\nCu system. There are three types of particles present: \nfine strengthening precipitates; dispersoid particles; \nand constituent particles [1]. Backerud et al. [2] have \nfound that the solidus, on cooling, for 7075 lies \nbetween 466\u02daC and 470\u02daC, depending on the cooling \nrate. For 7075, the age hardening precipitates are \nMgZn2 for ageing temperatures less than 200\u02daC [3]. \nAl2CuMg phase is also precipitated [3]. The \ndispersoid particles are soluble only in liquid and \ninclude Al12Mg2Cr and Al18Mg3Cr2 (E-phase) [4]. \nThese are 0.5-2\u03bcm in size and play an essential role \nin pinning grain and sub-grain boundaries. E-phase, \nin particular, is of the appropriate size and volume \nfraction to severely inhibit recrystallisation. Fe and \nSi are present in the alloy as impurities and give rise \nto constituent particles 1-30\u03bcm in size, which are \ndetrimental to mechanical properties [3] and are \nresistant to dissolution. \n7075 is usually supplied in the worked and heat \ntreated state. Provided the melting sequence matches \nthe solidification sequence, according to Backerud et \nal. [2], the first liquid to form during reheating \nwould be based on the sub-micron sized MgZn2 at \naround 470\u02daC. This would be followed by a reaction \nbetween Al and Mg2Si at around 550\u02daC\/560\u02daC. \nRecrystallisation in the solid state is defined as the \nformation and migration of large angle grain \nboundaries where the driving force is the decrease in \nthe free energy from the decrease in dislocations. \nThere has been little discussion in the literature of \nrecrystallisation (or a phenomenon which gives \nmicrostructural features very similar to \nrecrystallisation i.e. new, relatively equiaxed, grains \nnucleating and growing in a structure of elongated \ngrains) at temperatures above the solidus. This paper \nis concerned with this phenomenon. The work has \nbeen more fully reported elsewhere [5]. \nThixoforming involves forming alloys in the \nsemisolid state to near net shape (e.g. as-reviewed in \n[6,7]). The required spheroidal microstructure can be \nobtained by a number of routes, including the Strain \nInduced Melt Activated method (SIMA) [8] and \nABSTRACT: 7000 series aluminium alloys are currently machined from the wrought state with much waste. \nThere is therefore a motivation to identify effective near net shaping routes. Semi-solid processing is one such \npotential route. It relies on the thixotropic behaviour of alloys with non-dendritic spheroidal microstructures. \nIn the semisolid state the material thins when sheared and will flow to fill the die. When worked material is \nreheated, it recrystallises and moving into the semi-solid state, the required spheroidal microstructure \ndevelops. Here we examine the early stages of spheroid formation in 7075 aluminium alloy reheated from the \nas-supplied T6 condition. This alloy is very resistant to recrystallisation in the solid state due to the presence \nof dispersoid particles pinning grain boundaries. There is a sudden increase in the appearance of spheroidal \ngrains. There is a close association with the position of the first liquid to form. On reheating as-supplied \nmaterial to around 580\u02daC (fraction of liquid ~5%), a fully spheroidal microstructure can be obtained.  \nKey words: 7075 aluminium alloys, recrystallisation, pinning force, thixoforming, semisolid. \nRecrystallisation in the Semi-Solid State in 7075 Aluminium Alloy \nH.V.

The \nmaterial is worked, e.g. by extrusion, and then \nreheated. Recrystallisation occurs (generally below \nthe solidus) and the liquid penetrates the \nrecrystallised boundaries to give the spheroidal \nstructure. The first liquid to form tends to form at \ngrain boundaries because these are generally areas \nwith high solute concentrations. \nNet shaping thixoforming of wrought alloys such as \n7075 [10-16] is of considerable practical \nsignificance because these alloys are often shaped by \ncostly and wasteful machining operations. \nUnderstanding the development of the spheroidal \nmicrostructure will enable process optimisation.   \n2 EXPERIMENTAL METHOD \n2.1 Material and Microstructural \nExamination \nThe material had composition (wt%): \nAl5.70Zn2.54Mg1.34Cu0.21Fe0.20Cr0.04Mn0.10Si\n0.10Zr0.05Ti and was supplied in the T6 heat treated \nstate by Apollo Metals Ltd with an extrusion ratio of \n16:1. The samples were ground using 200, 400, 800 \nand 1200 grit papers, polished with 6 micron \ndiamond paste through to a final polish with \u00bc \nmicron using \u2018Silco\u2019 liquid. They were then etched \nusing Barkers etch (2%fluorboric acid) at 20V for \n1.5 minutes, with a stainless steel cathode. The \nsamples were viewed under polarised light with the \npolariser and analyser crossed to reveal grain \norientation. A gypsum prism was used to enhance \nthe colour of the images obtained using a Reichert \nJung Polyvar microscope.   \n2.2 Heating Tests to Investigate \nRecrystallisation at Different \nTemperatures \nSamples 2.5mmx10mmx15mm (with the extrusion \ndirection parallel to the surface with the largest area) \nwere heated in a salt bath. To suspend the specimens \nin the bath, one end of a piece of nichrome wire was \ncoiled around the sample to form a cage. A hole \n1.3mm in diameter was drilled in each sample and a \n1mm diameter thermocouple inserted. The sample \nwas heated in the salt bath for 10 minutes from the \ntime the sample entered the furnace.  \n \n3 RESULTS \nA typical starting material microstructure is shown \nin Fig.1. The grains are unrecrystallised as shown by \nthe contrast variations within the elongated grains. \nDuring isothermal tests, the fraction of \u2018spheroidal\u2019 \ngrains and the spheroidal grain size increase (Fig. 2). \n Fig. 1 Typical microstructure of the \ncommercial starting material.  \n \n  Fig. 2 Micrographs of material heated for 10 \nminutes in a salt bath at different temperatures within the \nsolidification range and quenched in brine. \n \nIn samples heated at temperatures up to 515\u02daC, there \nare very few incipient spheroidal grains, even after \nbeing held at temperature for 1 hour. When the \nmaterial is heated to 558\u02daC or above, the material is \nalmost entirely spheroidal after 10 minutes. The \nmicrostructure of the material quenched from 513\u02daC \nafter 10 minutes is shown in more detail in Fig. 3.  \n \n \nc) \u2018Black\u2019 areas in b) converted to white and superimposed on a). \nFig. 3 Material after heating for 10 \nminutes in a salt bath at 513\u02daC and quenching in brine.  \n \nFig. 3 b) is the bright field image and shows where \npools of liquid are present. The dark areas are \nassumed to be quenched liquid because of EDX \nevidence [5,13] which shows a concentration of Cu, \nZn and Mg in this region, elements expected to be in \nthe liquid. The pools of liquid coincide with the \npresence of incipient spheroidal grains in Fig. 3 a). \nThis is proved in Fig. 3 c) by making a transparent \noverlay of Fig. 3 b) (with the \u2018liquid\u2019 shown as \nwhite) and superimposing it on Fig. 3 a). In general, \nincipient spheroidal grains are associated with pools \nof liquid. There are few examples of liquid being \npresent without an incipient spherhoidal grains and \nfew examples of the reverse. A higher magnification \nimage is shown in Fig. 4 to give greater confidence \nabout the observation. \na)  \nb)      \n Fig. 4 Higher magnification of Fig. 3 \nmaterial a) Barkers etch and b) bright field of same area. \n4 DISCUSSION \nThe starting material (Fig. 1) is unrecrystallised and \nin the precipitation hardened state following T6 heat \ntreatment. Distributed through the matrix are the \nageing precipitates (mainly MgZn2). Dispersoids \nsuch as E-phase will be pinning the grain \nboundaries. Evidence for these microstructural \nfeatures from TEM is given in [11]. According to \nBackerud et al. [2], on reheating to above the solidus \nthe first reaction to occur will be the formation of \nliquid by the reaction of MgZn2. We then need to \nexplain why the \u2018recrystallisation\u2019 starts to occur at \ntemperatures which are above the solidus but below \nabout 540\u00b0C. We hypothesise that the E-phase and \nother dispersoids pinning the grain boundaries start \nto dissolve in the liquid and this initiates the \nrecrystallisation as the boundaries start to become \nunpinned. There is TEM evidence in [11,15] to show \nthat the precipitate free zones by boundaries are \nrelatively narrow (~ 100nm). It is therefore likely \nthat the E-phase and other dispersoids will be in \nclose proximity to MgZn2 as the MgZn2 particles \nthemselves react to form liquid. A possible \nmechanism is that, at temperature, sections of \nboundary  between pinning particles are bulging into \nthe matrix. As soon as a section of boundary touches \na pool of liquid, the liquid spreads along the \nboundary towards a pinning particle. In contact with \nliquid, the pinning particle dissolves and the \nboundary becomes unpinned. \n \nThe quenched liquid is rich in Cu, Zn and Mg, in \ncomparison with the matrix. This supports the \nargument that the first liquid to form is associated \nwith the hardening precipitates, rather than the \ndispersoids (which contain Cr along with Al and \nMg). \n \nIt appears that, as soon as liquid is present at \nboundaries, the grains begin to grow, with the \nboundaries showing the characteristic curved shape \nas they expand into other material (Fig. 4 b)). There \nare some liquid pockets in \u2018necklace\u2019 structures at \nrecrystallised boundaries that are migrating. This \nmay occur as unpinned boundaries start to sweep \nthrough, gathering up tiny liquid pools present in the \nmatrix as ageing precipitates start to form liquid. \n \nCONCLUDING REMARKS \n \nAt temperatures above the solidus but below about \n515\u00b0C, 7075 remains predominantly \nunrecrystallised. Above this temperature, \nrecrystallised grains grow, probably because the \npinning dispersoids dissolve.  These findings affect \nthe heating conditions for thixoforming 7075.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank the following for \nsupport: Lucas Advanced Engineering Systems \nDevelopment; University of Sheffield Department of \nEngineering Materials, University of Leicester \nDepartment of Engineering, the COST 541 Project, \nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil, the University of Liege, and the First \nEurope Project.
