It focuses on one main research question: to what \nextent does welfare state regime classification explain the proportional variation of \nself-perceived health between European countries, when individual and regional \nvariation is accounted for? This not only implies a need to determine the degree to \nwhich self-perceived health actually varies between countries but also to examine \nwhether (and if so, why) the characteristics of certain types of welfare state and \nwelfare state regimes may have a health-protective effect.  \n \nWelfare states and welfare state regimes \nIt is now widely acknowledged that welfare states are important determinants of \nhealth in Europe as they mediate the extent, and impact, of socio-economic position \non health (e.g. Bambra, 2006a; Eikemo, Huisman, Bambra, & Kunst, in press; \nNavarro et al., 2003). Health status, especially inequalities in health within and \nbetween European countries, is largely determined by income inequalities, the \ndistribution of wealth, and other aspects of socio-economic inequalities (Kawachi, \nKennedy, Lochner, & Prothrow-Stith, 1997; Mackenbach et al., 1997; Wilkinson, \n1996). Welfare provision in its entirety (social transfers and welfare services) is \ndesigned to address these issues of inequality and should therefore have a bearing \nupon health outcomes (Bartley & Blane, 1997; Conley & Springer, 2001; Navarro et \nal., 2003) Welfare states provide a variety of social transfers (such as housing related \nbenefits, unemployment, pensions, and sickness and disability benefits) as well as key \nservices (most notably health care or social services), which together mediate the \n  4 \nrelationship between socio-economic position and health. The principles underpinning \nwelfare states, the generosity of social transfers, and entitlements, vary extensively \nacross European countries. For example, in some unemployment benefits are related \nto previous earnings (e.g. Norway, Germany) whereas in others they are provided at a \nstandard flat-rate (e.g. UK) lowering the relative wage replacement rate (Eikemo & \nBambra, in press). Similarly, entitlement to welfare state benefits and services varies, \nwith some countries providing universal coverage (e.g. Sweden or Norway) whilst \nothers use means-testing (e.g. Ireland or UK).  \n \nWelfare state typologies place those welfare states that are the most similar (in terms \nof principles, provision, etc) together into clusters of countries with different welfare \nstate regimes, emphasising within regime coherence and between regime differences. \nInfluential within this field is the well known work of Esping-Andersen (1990). In \nThe Three Worlds of Welfare State Capitalism (1990), he classifies welfare states into \nthree regime types (Liberal, Conservative, Social Democratic) on the basis of three \nprinciples: decommodification (the extent to which an individual\u201fs welfare is reliant \nupon the market), social stratification (the role of welfare states in maintaining or \nbreaking down social stratification), and the private-public mix (the relative roles of \nthe state, the family and the market in welfare provision). A fourth principle, \ndefamilisation (\u201ethe degree to which individual adults can uphold a socially \nacceptable standard of living, independently of family relationships, either through \npaid work or through social security provisions\u201f) (Lister, 1997) was added to the \nanalysis in 1999 (Esping-Andersen, 1999). These principles reflect the relative roles \nof the state, the family and the market in the provision of welfare. Liberal (UK, \nIreland) welfare states are characterised by their basic and minimal levels of \n  5 \nprovision: social transfers are modest and often attract strict entitlement criteria; \nrecipients are usually means-tested and stigmatised; the dominance of the market is \nencouraged both passively, by guaranteeing only a minimum, and actively, by \nsubsidising private welfare schemes. The conservative welfare state regime \n(Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Italy and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands) is \ndistinguished by its \u201estatus differentiating\u201f welfare programs in which benefits are \noften earnings related, administered through the employer; and geared towards \nmaintaining existing social patterns. The role of the family is also emphasised and the \nredistributive impact is minimal. However, the role of the market is marginalised. The \nSocial Democratic regime type (Scandinavian countries), is characterised by \nuniversalism, comparatively generous social transfers, a commitment to full \nemployment and income protection; and a strongly interventionist state. The state is \nused to promote social equality through a redistributive social security system.  \n \nThere has been extensive scholarly debate about the theoretical and empirical value of \nthe Three Worlds typology (for a detailed summary see Arts & Gelissen, 2002 or \nBambra, 2006b) and as a result of this, modified or alternative typologies have been \nproposed by others (Bambra C., 2004, 2005a, 2005b; Bonoli, 1997; Castles & \nMitchell, 1993; Korpi & Palme, 1998; Navarro et al., 2006), most of which place \nemphasis on those characteristics of welfare states not extensively examined by \nEsping-Andersen or which cover more countries. Ferrera\u201fs (1996) four-fold typology, \nwhich focuses on different dimensions of how social benefits are granted and \norganised, has been highlighted as one of the most empirically accurate welfare state \nregime typologies (Bambra, 2007a). Ferrera makes a distinction between the \nScandinavian (Social Democratic), Anglo-Saxon (Liberal), Bismarckian \n  6 \n(Conservative) and Southern countries (Figure 1). Although there are clear similarities \nbetween Ferrera\u201fs and Esping-Andersen\u201fs typologies, Ferrera\u201fs classification is \nintended to account for differences in the way welfare is delivered whilst Esping-\nAndersen\u201fs still tends to emphasise the quantity of welfare provided (Bambra, 2007a; \nBonoli, 1997). In this way, the additional Southern regime is characterised by a \nfragmented system of welfare provision which consists of diverse income \nmaintenance schemes that range from the meagre to the generous and a health care \nsystem that provides only limited and partial coverage. There is also a strong reliance \non the family and charitable sector (Ferrera, 1996). One new challenge to \nconventional welfare regime typologies concerns the Eastern European countries. \nThese countries have experienced extensive economic upheaval and have undertaken \ncomprehensive social reforms throughout the 1990s (Kovacs, 2002). In comparison \nwith the other member states of the European Union, they have limited health service \nprovision and overall population health is relatively poor. In our analysis, we will use \nFerrera\u201fs typology (1996) expanded by adding a category for Eastern Europe (Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia). \n \nHealth differences between individuals and regions \nAlthough the focus of this paper lies at country-level, it is important to consider health \nvariations at the individual level additionally, because health is mainly attributed to \nindividual characteristics. At this level, social inequalities in health have mainly been \napproached by means of occupational class (Kunst & Mackenbach, 1994; Kunst et \nal., 2005), educational attainment (Cavelaars et al., 1998b; Silventoinen & Lahelma, \n2002) and income (Adler et al., 1994; Cavelaars et al., 1998a; Fritzell, Nermo, & \nLundberg, 2004; Marmot, 2002; Subramanian & Kawach, 2006a; Subramanian & \n  7 \nKawachi, 2004; Wagstaff & van Doorslaer, 2000), all regarded as indicators of socio-\neconomic status (SES). We have also seen that social network (social contacts with \none or several persons) and social support (quality of social interactions) appear to \nmake individuals feel healthier, live longer, feel better and cope with difficulties due \nto chronic diseases and acute difficulties (Berkman, 1985; House, Landis, & \nUmberson, 1988; Pinquart & Sorensen, 2000; Wilkinson, 1999a, 1999b).  \n \nThe data used in this study also allows us to investigate the proportional variation of \nself-perceived health among regions as compared to individual and country-level \nvariation. Even though the extent to which self-perceived health varies among regions \nwithin European countries has not been previously investigated, we might expect that \nself-perceived health in Europe is also related to regional factors. Previous studies of \nmortality have shown that there is a regional north-south gradient in ischaemic heart \ndisease mortality in both Britain and France, which could be partly explained by \npeople\u201fs socioeconomic position (Lang et al., 1999; Morris et al., 2001). Another \nstudy concluded that ischaemic heart disease mortality is about 50% higher in East \ncompared to West Germany (Muller-Nordhorn, Rossnagel, Mey, & Willich, 2004). \n \nHealth differences between countries and welfare state regimes \nSome European countries are healthier than others (Mackenbach, 2006) and the main \naim of this study is to examine and explain disparities of self-perceived health in \nEurope by means of welfare state regimes, when individual and regional variation are \naccounted for. Welfare state regime typologies have previously been used to analyse \ncross-national differences in population health (Chung & Muntaner, 2007; Coburn, \n2004; Navarro et al., 2003; Navarro et al., 2006). These studies have invariably all \n  8 \nconcluded that population health is enhanced by the relatively generous and universal \nwelfare provision of the Scandinavian countries (Chung & Muntaner, 2007; Coburn, \n2004; Navarro et al., 2003; Navarro et al., 2006). For example, studies have \nconsistently shown that infant mortality rates (IMR) vary significantly by welfare \nregime type (Bambra, 2006a; Chung & Muntaner, 2007; Coburn, 2004; Navarro et al., \n2006), with rates lowest in the Scandinavian countries and highest in the Southern \nregimes. These systematic differences in health outcomes may be explained by the \nrelative roles of the state, the family and the market in welfare provision (Esping-\nAndersen, 1990) with the more highly decommodifying welfare states (Scandinavian) \n- through income redistribution (Dahl, Elstad, Hofoss, & Martin-Mollard, 2006; \nSubramanian & Kawachi, 2006b; Torsheim, Currie, Boyce, & Samdal, 2006b; \nTorsheim et al., 2006a) and low unemployment (Ferrie, Shipley, Stansfeld, & Marmot, \n2002; Keefe et al., 2002; Lahelma, 1992; Martikainen & Valkonen, 1996) \u2013 providing \nbetter protection against the health effects of a low market (socio-economic) position. \nFurthermore, the welfare state is important to population health in terms of how the \nstate interacts with the family structure (Hatland, 2001), and thereby reduces the \nwelfare burden on families and\/or women (the state de-familises the family\/women) \n(Bambra, 2004, 2007b; Esping-Andersen, 1999; Korpi, 2000).  \n \nPrevious studies of health differences between welfare state regimes (e.g. Bambra, \n2006a; Chung & Muntaner, 2007; Coburn, 2004) have used mortality (especially \nIMR) or life expectancy data as their health outcomes (Navarro et al., 2006); they \nhave tended to rely on Esping-Andersen\u201fs three-fold classification of welfare states \n(often excluding Southern and Eastern Europe), and they have seldom utilised a \nmultilevel design (except for the studies of Olsen & Dahl (2007) and Chung & \n  9 \nMuntaner (2007),  in which two levels were applied). Therefore, this paper is the first \nto focus particularly on morbidity (self-perceived health) differences between welfare \nstate regimes in Europe. This study is also distinguished from others in this field \nbecause we use a five-fold typology of welfare states, and we also use multilevel \nanalysis with three levels.   \n \nData and methods \nThis study is based on the cumulative data file (edition 2.0) for the first two rounds \n(fielded in 2002 and 2004) of the European Social Survey (ESS), which was released \non January 29, 2007. The main objective of the ESS is to provide high quality data \nover time about changing social attitudes and values in Europe. Extensive descriptions \nof the ESS are at the ESS web site (www.europeansocialsurvey.org). The data and \nextensive documentation are freely available for downloading at the Norwegian \nSocial Science Data Services (NSD) web site (www.nsd.uib.no). Available data from \n65 065 individuals (people aged 25 + were included), within 218 regions (see \nappendix for detailed description), within 21 countries, were included in a multilevel \nanalysis after deleting cases listwise by each variable in our analysis. The 21 countries \nwere further defined into 5 types of welfare regimes.  \n \nHealth outcome variables \nWe used two indicators of morbidity available in the ESS: self reported general health \nand limiting longstanding illness. Self reported general health was constructed from a \nvariable asking; \u201eHow is your (physical and mental) health in general?\u201f. Eligible \nresponses were \u201every good\u201f, \u201egood\u201f, \u201efair\u201f, \u201ebad\u201f, and \u201every bad\u201f. We dichotomized \nthe variable into \u201every good or good\u201f health versus \u201eless than good\u201f health (\u201efair\u201f, \n  10 \n\u201ebad\u201f, and \u201every bad\u201f). As for limiting longstanding illness, people were asked if they \nwere hampered in daily activities in any way by any limiting longstanding illness or \ndisability, infirmity or mental health problem. Eligible responses were \u201eyes a lot\u201f, \n\u201eyes to some extent\u201f and \u201eno\u201f. We dichotomized this variable into \u201eyes\u201f (regardless of \nwhether to some extent or a lot) and \u201eno\u201f.  \n \n--- Table 1 about here --- \n \nIndividual level explanatory variables \nThe first explanatory variable is educational attainment, where people were asked to \nstate their highest achieved level of education ranging from \u201enot completed primary \neducation\u201f to \u201esecond stage of tertiary education\u201f. We defined \u201enot completed primary \neducation\u201f, \u201eprimary or first stage of basic\u201f, and \u201elower secondary or second stage of \nbasic\u201f as \u201eprimary education\u201f, \u201eupper secondary\u201f remains unchanged, while \u201epost \nsecondary\/non-tertiary\u201f, \u201efirst stage of tertiary\u201f, and \u201esecond stage of tertiary\u201f are \ndefined as \u201epost-secondary \/ tertiary education\u201f. Occupational class was defined \naccording to the European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC) \n(www.iser.essex.ac.uk\/esec\/), which is a further development of the widely applied \nEGP classification (Erikson & Goldthorpe, 1992). The ESeC classification classifies \npeople according to their positions within labour markets and production units, with \nspecial attention to their employment relations. The ESeC is designed to facilitate \ninternational overviews and cross-national comparisons across the EU (Rose & \nHarrison, 2007). In order to improve population coverage, those who are not currently \nin paid employment are allocated to an ESeC class on the basis of their last main paid \njob. We applied a summary measure comparing classes 5 to 9 (lower occupational \n  11 \nclasses) with 1 to 4 (higher occupational classes). Those with unknown occupation \nwere included in the analyses as \u201eno reported class\u201f (see Table 1 for further \ndescription). Just over 7 % of the respondents did not report any occupation and were \nincluded in the analysis with \u201eno reported occupation\u201f. Income was measured by \nannual household income divided into four equal sized groups (quartiles).  Individuals \nwere classified into their relative economic income position within each country in \norder to control for different currencies and standards of living within the various \ncountries. (To include more cases, an extra group consisting of people with no \ninformation on income, was added to the dummy-set). Social network was measured \nby frequency of social meetings with friends, relatives or colleagues. The response \ncategories \u201enever\u201f, \u201eless than once a month\u201f, \u201eonce a month\u201f and \u201eseveral times a \nmonth\u201f were recoded in to one group (\u201elimited social network\u201f), while the values \ndescribing \u201eonce a week\u201f, \u201eseveral times a week\u201f, and \u201eevery day\u201f were set as the \nreference category. Social support was measured by quality of social meetings. The \nquestion asked was whether the person has anyone to discuss intimate or personal \nmatters with. This variable was divided into two categories by the response categories \n\u201eyes\u201f and \u201eno\u201f.   \n \nCountry level explanatory variables \nWe investigated whether type of welfare regime may contribute in explaining the \nhealth variation between countries by classifying the 21 countries into five different \ncategories according to the Ferrera (1996) classification expanded by a category for \nEastern Europe (Figure 1). More information about all explanatory variables at level 1 \nand 2 is given in Table 1. \n \n  12 \n \n--- Table 1 about here --- \nMultilevel modelling \nMultilevel models are increasingly used within the social sciences because they allow \nthe possibility of modelling outcomes as a function of explanatory variables at \ndifferent levels. The basic principle is that the data are structured in hierarchically \nnested groups (Kreft & Leeuw, 1998; Leyland & Goldstein, 2004). The ESS allows \nfor three hierarchic levels to be used. The level 1 units are individual people; the level \n2 units are regions within countries, while the units at level 3 are European countries. \nBy using general health and limiting longstanding illness as the dependent variables, \nwe were able to investigate to what extent health varies at each level compared to the \nothers and at the same time to seek to identify factors that may explain this variation.  \n \nThe analyses were done in two steps. First, we analysed the variation in health \nwithout using any explanatory variables in order to decompose the variance of the \nintercept into variance components for each of the three levels (Table 2). Such models \nare called intercept-only models or just variance component models. The second step \nwas to analyze a model with all the lower explanatory variables fixed, in order to see \nhow health varies by means of individual characteristic such as sex, age and \nsocioeconomic position (Table 3, Model 1). Thereafter, we added the country-level \nwelfare regime variables (level 3) as shown in the second model of Table 3. The 3-\nlevel logistic variance component model, which has no explanatory variables, may be \nwritten as follows: \nLijk = \uf0620jk \n\uf0620jk =  \uf0620 + V0k + U0j+ eijk \n  13 \n \nThe expression Lijk represenents the linear logit function of the model. The intercept \n(\uf0620) varies randomly across regions and countries, which is illustrated by the j and k \nsubscript attached to it. The intercept for the jth region is given by the average \nintercept \uf0620 plus a random departure u0jk. Following the same logic, the intercept for \nthe kth country will be the average intercept \uf0620 plus the random variation v0k. eijk \nrepresents the individual-level residual. We can therefore say that the parameter \uf0620 \nconstitutes the fixed part of the regression, while u0jk and v0k are random \u201cresiduals\u201d \non the regional and national level. The second step was to include explanatory \nvariables: \n \nLijk = \uf0620jk+ \uf0621X1ijk + \uf0622X2ijk + \u2026 + \uf062n+1Xn+1ijk \n\uf0620jk = \uf0620 + V0k + U0j+ eijk \n \nThe parameters were calculated using the software MLwiN. Browne (2003) and \nGoldstein (2003) advise the use of MCMC methods (with starting values based on the \n2\nnd\n PQL method) for binary response models. The big advantage of MCMC is that it \nallows exact interference, which is important for any level 3 parameters (such as \nvariance) where the number of units is small. Alternatively we could have applied \nlaplace methods, but these are also approximations to max likelihood and not always \nguaranteed to work well and quadrature can be very slow when there are a lot of \nparameters.   \n \nThe parameter estimates in all models are given with 95 % confidence intervals. For \nall multilevel models, we calculated the variance partition coefficient (VPC), which \n  14 \ngives the proportion of the total variance that is attributable to each level. As the level \n1 and 2+3 variances are not on the same scale, we have used the latent variable \napproach (see Snijders & Bosker (1999) for further details), by assuming the observed \nvalues (0 and 1) arise from an underlying continuous variable with logistic \ndistribution. The variance of a standard logistic distribution is \u03c02 \/ 3 \u2248 3.29 and the \nlevel 1 variance will be replaced by this value, so that both the level 1 and level 2+3 \nvariances are allocated on a continuous scale. For 3-level discrete response models, \nthe VPC at country-level may calculated as [V0k \/ (V0k + U0j+ 3.29)], the VPC at \nregional level as [U0k \/(V0k + U0j+ 3.29)], while individual-level VPC equals [3.29 \/( \nV0k + U0j+ 3.29)]. We have presented these numbers as % of total variance \n(VPC*100).  \n \nResults \nThe interpretation of the results from Table 2 is very straightforward, as it simply \nshows how much of the total variance of self-perceived health that is attributed to \neach of the three levels. This is calculated as the ratio of the random country variance \n(i.e. the intercept) to the total variance. For example, the country-level variance of \npoor general health using the 2\nnd\n order PQL method is 0.318, which gives a \nproportional variance (in percent) of 8.68. The calculation is [0.318 \/ (3.29 + 0.054 + \n0.318))]*100. Thus, roughly 8.68 % of the variation of health is due to differences \namong the countries. At least four findings should be noted from Table 2 (3-level \nvariance component models). First, the variation of peoples\u201f general (poor) health is \nmainly caused by individual factors, as roughly 90 % of the total variation is located \nhere. Second, people\u201fs general health does not seem to vary much across regions \nwithin countries. Third, it appears that cases of limiting longstanding illness vary less \n  15 \nthan general poor health between European countries, as only 3.92 % of the total \nvariation was attributable at this level according to the 2\nnd\n PQL-estimation. Because \nthere is very little variation to explain with respect to limiting longstanding illness, we \nwill only focus on poor general health in the following multilevel analyses. Finally, \nTable 2 compares the variance attributable at each level using different modelling \ntechniques to test the sensitivity of this analysis to different methods. The results did \nnot change substantially according to the various modelling technique. The \nforthcoming multilevel analysis with explanatory variables (Table 3) will thus be \nbased on the Bayesian MCMC estimation with priors from 2\nnd\n PQL method only.    \n \n--- Table 2 about here --- \n \nThe multilevel analyses shown in Table 3 (3-level random intercept models) include \nexplanatory variables. Model 1 includes level-1 variables only and shows that having \npoor health is positively correlated with being older, being a woman, having only \nprimary education, belonging to lower social classes, having low income, having a \npoor social network and not much social support. Largest health differences were \nobserved between those with low (1st quartile) and high (4th\n \nquartile) income \n(OR=1.75) and between high and low educated people (OR=1.66). The variation in \nintercepts between countries indicates that 9.65 % of the total variation of individual \nhealth outcomes is due to country-level characteristics, after we have adjusted for \nindividual-level characteristics (Table 3). \n \nThe country-level variation is reduced from 0.355 (model 1) to 0.189 in model 2 after \ncontrolling for the welfare regime typologies, which means that the proportional \n  16 \nvariance is reduced from 9.65 % to 5.43 %. This model shows that Scandinavian and \nAnglo-Saxon countries seem to have the best general health situation, while Southern \nwelfare regimes and East European countries seem to have the worst general health \ncompared to the Scandinavian countries. Bismarckian welfare regimes appear to hold \nan average position. The individual-level variables did not seem to change \nsubstantially from the first to the second model.  \n \n \n--- Table 3 about here --- \n \nDiscussion \nSummarising the results, this study has shown that nearly 90% of the variation of self-\nperceived general health outcomes was due to characteristics at the individual level. \nCountry-level characteristics accounted for around 10 % of disparities in self-\nperceived health. Intra-country regional variation, however, was almost non-existent \nafter controlling for individual and country level variation. The key finding of this \nstudy is that the Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon welfare regimes seem to have \narrangements that give them an advantage compared to Southern and East European \nwelfare systems. \n \nBefore going deeper into this main finding, we have to consider some possible \nmethodological limitations, which could influence this main result of the study. First, \nit is important to be aware of possible artefacts due to cultural differences in European \ncountries. The fact that limiting longstanding illness may be regarded as a more robust \nmeasure than people\u201fs general health perception, combined with our finding that \n  17 \ngeneral health outcomes vary more at the national level compared to those of limiting \nlongstanding illness, may indicate that possible biases due to different cultural health \nperceptions must be addressed. Results from a Finnish study, comparing cultural \ndifferences in self-rated health in Finland and Italy, suggest that self-rated health is a \nuseful\n \nsummary of physical health, but may be sensitive to cultural environment \n(Jylha, Guralnik, Ferrucci, Jokela, & Heikkinen, 1998). We are therefore aware of the \npossibility that health expectations may vary according to culture and that direct \ncultural comparisons of self-rated health outcomes in general should be made with \ncaution. The strength of this study, however, is that all questions are collected from \nthe same survey, asking the same questions within the same period of time. Second, \nself-rated health is not as reliable as studies of mortality. However, a growing number \nof studies have shown that weaker measures of health are strongly correlated with \nharder health measures, such as death, both in the USA (Idler & Benyamini, 1997) \nand in Europe (Heistaro, Jousilahti, Lahelma, Vartiainen, & Puska, 2001). Third, the \noutcomes of poor general health might be sensitive to the cut off point on the health \nscale. Defining \u201efair health\u201f as \u201egood health\u201f could change the between-country \ndifferences, as the category \u201efair\u201f may not be strictly comparable between countries. \nHowever, sensitivity analyses (not shown in tables) showed that the main pattern \nbetween the welfare regimes did not change when \u201efair\u201f was defined as \u201egood health\u201f. \nFurthermore, defining \u201efair\u201f as \u201epoor health\u201f has become more or less the standard \nprocedure within social epidemiology and we have mainly done this for comparative \nreasons. Fourth, our analysis has not tested other attributes of countries such as GDP \nor income inequality. These might have associations with welfare regime and the \nrelationships we have reported may therefore not be directly attributable to the \nwelfare regimes as such, but possibly to other national factors that are not measured \n  18 \nhere. For example, differences between the Southern and Eastern European regimes \non the one hand, and those of Northern Europe on the other hand, are perhaps due to \nthe combined effects of the relative poverty of these countries (Olsen & Dahl, 2007) \n(they have lower GDP per capita than the Bismarckian, Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian \ncountries), higher rates of smoking prevalence, the overhang of recent political \nupheavals and ex-dictatorship (Navarro et al., 2006), as well as the somewhat residual \nand fragmentary nature of their welfare state provision with its high reliance on the \nfamily and incomplete population coverage (Leibfreid, 1992). Finally, Bayesian \nestimation procedures vary according to different starting values. However, sensitivity \nanalyses (not shown in tables) showed that our main results were not sensitive to \ndifferent prior distributions. We also performed bootstrap estimations (using both \nMQL and PQL), which improves the accuracy of inferences about parameter values \nand corrects bias in parameter estimates (Goldstein & Rasbash, 1996). These analyses \nalso confirmed our main results. \n \nIndividuals and regions \nSocioeconomic inequalities in health have been reported among individuals \nthroughout Europe to a larger or lesser extent (Mackenbach & Bakker, 2002). In our \nstudy, individual factors account for nearly 90 % of differences in health status in our \nstudy. All of our indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) demonstrated a consistent \npattern of health differences between groups of high and low SES. Not only were all \nassociations significant; a perfect gradient was also observed with respect to the \nincome quartiles and levels of education. These observations are supported by \nnumerous studies, which have shown that people with privileged socio-economic \nstatus on the average have better general health and live longer than people with low \n  19 \nsocio-economic status (EUROTHINE - final report, 2007; Mackenbach, 2006; \nSiegrist & Marmot, 2006). Self-perceived health did not seem to vary significantly \namong the 218 regions in this study when controlling for individual and country level \nvariation. Although previous studies have shown that health indeed may vary by \nregion when a limited number of regions are examined (Lang et al., 1999; Morris et \nal., 2001; Muller-Nordhorn et al., 2004) they do not seem to have an effect in a \nbroader European perspective. However, these studies did control for both individual \nand country level variation. \n \nThe links between welfare regimes and health status  \nWelfare regime characteristics are important factors in explaining the variation of \nself-perceived health between different European populations, as they explain about \nhalf of the between-country variation in health. The main finding of this study is that \nthere are differences in self-perceived health between different welfare state regimes \nand that the Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon welfare regimes seem to have \narrangements that give them an advantage compared to the Southern and East \nEuropean welfare states.  \nThat there are differences in self-perceived health between different welfare state \nregimes is perhaps not that surprising either empirically or theoretically. Previous \nempirical studies have also consistently identified such patterns (Bambra, 2006a; \nChung & Muntaner, 2007; Coburn, 2004; Navarro et al., 2006; Olsen & Dahl, 2007). \nIn theoretical terms, whilst all welfare states are designed to address issues of \ninequality, they do so in different ways and to different extents (Esping-Andersen, \n1990). Empirically, this has been demonstrated in a number of studies. In a \nlongitudinal cross-national study of income inequalities and welfare provision \n  20 \nbetween countries, Coburn (2004) concluded that countries which were the least neo-\nliberal in their economic and social policy orientation (i.e. the Scandinavian welfare \nstates), had lower Infant Mortality Rates (IMR), and less mortality at younger ages. \nThis study also suggested that welfare state regime might be the link between \nGDP\/capita and mortality. Similarly, Bambra (2006a) found significant differences in \nIMR between Esping-Andersen\u201fs three worlds of welfare: weighted IMR for the \nLiberal (Anglo-Saxon), Conservative (Bismarckian) and Social Democratic \n(Scandinavian) regimes were 6.7, 4.5 and 4.0 respectively. This study also found a \nmoderate correlation between decommodification levels (1998 data) and IMR (r=-\n0.585, p=0.018). In another recent study of IMR, Navarro et al. (2006) examined \ndifferences between four different welfare state regimes (grouped in terms of political \ntraditions), they found that those countries which have had long periods of \ngovernment by redistributive political parties (most notably the Scandinavian \ncountries) have experienced lower IMR and, to a lesser extent, increased life \nexpectancy at birth. These findings were reinforced by Chung and Muntaneer\u201fs \n(2007) multilevel longitudinal analysis of welfare state regimes in which they found \nthat around 20% of the difference in infant mortality rate among countries, and 10% \nfor low birth weight, could be explained by the type of welfare state. Social \nDemocratic (Scandinavian) countries had significantly lower IMR and low birth \nweight rates, compared to all other welfare state regimes (when the other three \nregimes in the analysis were combined). Our study reinforces and extends the results \nof these studies by showing that there are also differences between welfare state \nregimes in respect of morbidity (as measured by self-perceived health), when regional \nand country-level health variation is accounted for.  \n \n  21 \nSuggested explanations for the better performance of the Scandinavian welfare state \nregimes in terms of both mortality, and now morbidity, have varied. For example, \nCoburn (2004) and Bambra (2006a) have both suggested that the key characteristics \nof the Scandinavian welfare state package (universalism, generous replacement rates, \nextensive welfare services) result in narrower income inequalities and higher levels of \ndecommodification, both of which are associated with better population health. For \nexample, Wilkinson has highlighted that societies with lower income inequalities \nhave better health than those with larger inequalities. Furthermore, higher \ndecommodification is associated with lower infant mortality (Bambra, 2006a; Coburn, \n2004). Coburn (2004), along with Navarro et al. (2003; 2006), have also highlighted \nthe importance of the accumulative positive effect on income inequalities of \ngovernance by pro-redistribution political parties in the Scandinavian countries. Other \ncommentators (for example Bambra et al., 2007b; or Stanistreet, Bambra, & Scott-\nSamuel, 2005) have also suggested that increased gender equality within the \nScandinavian welfare states may be another incremental factor behind their better \nhealth outcomes. Furthermore, proponents of the social capital approach have \nhighlighted the high levels of social cohesion and integration within Scandinavian \nsocieties (e.g. Putnam, 2000), something which has also been associated with better \npopulation health (e.g. Kawachi et al., 1997). Overall, following Chung and Muntaner \n(2007), the literature suggests that it is unlikely that there is one particular facet of the \nScandinavian welfare model that leads to better health outcomes, rather it is the \ninteraction and combination of a variety of policies (e.g. universal access to welfare \nservices, higher replacement rates, higher levels of employment amongst both men \nand women), over a sustained period of time (Chung & Muntaner, 2007; Navarro V. \n  22 \net al., 2006) which has led to a health enhancing reduction in material and social \ninequality. \n \nOur study has also shown that self-perceived health is significantly worse in the \nSouthern and Eastern European regimes. This result is also in keeping with the \nexisting research literature as many studies have highlighted the comparatively poor \nperformance of these countries (Bobak, Pikhart, Rose, Hertzman, & Marmot, 2000; \nCarlson, 1998; Knesebeck, Verde, & Dragano, 2006; Olsen & Dahl, 2007) \nparticularly in terms of mortality (see for example Leinsalu, Vagero, & Kunst, 2003; \nMackenbach, 2006; Shkolnikov et al., 2006; Valkonen, 2001).  Although the existing \nresearch literature on health differences between welfare state regimes is unequivocal \non the better performance of the Scandinavian welfare model, and the poorer \nperformance of the Eastern and Southern European countries (Bambra, 2006a; Chung \n& Muntaner, 2007; Coburn, 2004; Navarro et al., 2006; Olsen & Dahl, 2007); it is \nless unanimous on the relatively poor performance of the Anglo-Saxon countries. \nSome studies (e.g. Bambra, 2006a; Coburn, 2004) have demonstrated the \ncomparatively poor population health of Anglo-Saxon countries (particularly in terms \nof IMR). For example, Navarro and Shi (2001) and Coburn (2004) using a four-fold \ntypology, and Bambra (2006a) using a three-fold typology of welfare state regimes, \nall found that  IMR were significantly higher in the Anglo-Saxon countries than the \nBismarckian or Scandinavian. Coburn (2004) also suggested that the Anglo-Saxon \ncountries, due to their pursuit of more neo-liberal approaches (e.g. less public \nexpenditure on welfare and a corresponding rise in reliance upon the market as a \nprovider of welfare) did not experience the expected decreases in the period 1960-\n1995 in infant mortality due to their relatively high GDP\/per capita (for example, in \n  23 \n1960 the UK was ranked as 7th of 18 OECD countries in terms of IMR, by 1995 it \nhad slipped to 13th). However, in contrast, the recent study by Chung and Muntaner \n(2007) of IMR and low birth weights by welfare state regime over a 39 year period \nfound that when all four of the welfare state regimes used in the study were compared \nseparately (rather than Scandinavian versus the other three regime types combined), \nthere were no significant differences between the four regimes. Similarly, Coburn\u201fs \n(2004) study suggested that there were less pronounced differences in mortality in \nlater life between the Anglo-Saxon countries and the other welfare state regimes and \nNavarro et al.\u201fs (2006) study found less conclusive evidence of between regime \ndifferences for life expectancy.  \nOur study of variations in self-perceived health by welfare state regime therefore adds \nto this ongoing research debate. Given the uncertainty of the research literature in this \narea, it is only possible to speculate on possible explanations for the, somewhat \ncounter-intuitive, performance of the Anglo-Saxon countries. One possibly quite \nsubstantial explanation which we would like to put forward is the role of health care \nservices, an often overlooked social determinant of health (Chung & Muntaner, 2007). \nAlthough the Anglo-Saxon countries in our European study - the UK and Ireland - \nconform fairly well to the general characteristics of an Anglo-Saxon approach to \nsocial transfers e.g. use of means-testing, restrictive entitlement criteria, and low \nreplacement rates (Esping-Andersen, 1990); they do not take a \u201dtypically\u201d Anglo-\nSaxon market based approach to the provision of key welfare state services (Bambra, \n2005a, 2005b). Most notably, health care is not provided by a market based system \n(as it is in the USA or Australia). For example, in the UK \u2013 like the Scandinavian \ncountries \u2013 health care is provided via a National Health Service with similar \ncoverage rates and low levels of private health care expenditure as in the \n  24 \nScandinavian countries (Bambra, 2005a, 2005b).  It is possible that such highly \ndecommodified health care services mediate the relationship between the otherwise \nAnglo-Saxon social transfer policies of the UK and Ireland, on self-perceived health. \nClearly, more empirical examination of this and other possible explanations is \nrequired.  \n \nConclusion \nThis study confirms what previous studies on the social determinants of health have \nshown; that socio-economic position is important in explaining disparities in health at \nthe individual level. However, going further into the mechanisms of different welfare \nstate regimes is an important path to follow in the process of identifying interventions \nto improve public health, as welfare regime appears to account for approximately half \nof the national-level variation of health inequalities among European countries. \nScandinavian and Anglo-Saxon welfare regimes were observed to have better self-\nperceived general health than Bismarckian, Southern and East European welfare \nregimes. Welfare state characteristics such as levels of decommodification and the \nextent of welfare services might contribute to these differentials.  \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAdler, N.
