Most of the comparative studies relied on indirect\ncomparisons based on scattered output, consumption, or demographic data. The\nfew that attempted comparisons of direct income were largely based on scattered\ninformation about wages and prices in Asia.5 Our knowledge of real incomes in\nEurope is broad and deep because since the mid-nineteenth century scholars have\nbeen compiling databases of wages and prices for European cities from the late\nmiddle ages into the nineteenth century when official statistics begin.\nThis article, by assembling and constructing systematic data on wages and\nprices from Imperial ministry records, merchant account books, and local gazet-\nteers, is an attempt to fill that gap for China in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies. These wage series, deflated by appropriate cost of living indices using\nreconstructed consumption baskets, are then compared to the Japanese, Indian,\nand European evidence to assess the relative levels of wage earners\u2019 real income at\nthe two ends of Eurasia. The comparisons paint a less optimistic picture of Asian\nperformance than the revisionists suggest.\nTaking the hypothesis of Adam Smith at the head of this article as a point of\ndeparture, the present study compares the \u2018money price\u2019 of labour in China and\nEurope. For this purpose, wage rates are expressed in grams of silver earned per\nday in the two regions. Unminted silver measured in taels (one tael equalled 37\ngrams)6 was a universal medium of exchange in China in this period.The terms on\nwhich silver coins exchanged defined the market exchange rate of European and\nAsian moneys. Next, the \u2018money price of subsistence\u2019 is compared.This is a more\ncomplicated problem since the subsistence foods were different in China and\nEurope. Fortunately, the different methods adopted to tackle this problem turn\nout to imply similar relative price levels. Once they are measured, the differences\nbetween European and Chinese money wages and costs of subsistence and\nthe implications of those differences for the \u2018real recompence of labour\u2019 can be\nperceived.\nThe rest of the article is divided into six sections with a conclusion.The first two\nsections review a variety of Chinese wage data to establish the history of nominal\nwages from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The focus is set on the\nhistories of Canton, Beijing, and the nearby cities of Suzhou and Shanghai in the\nYangzi Delta, because more information is available for these cities, and because\nthey are comparable to the large cities in Europe and Japan for which we have\nsimilar information. In section III, nominal wages in China and Europe are\ncompared to see if Smith was correct about the \u2018money price of labour\u2019.

In section V, the authors compare Smithian price\nindices to Fisher Ideal Indices for broader consumer bundles and show that they\nyield similar results in a comparison of London and Beijing. In section VI, the real\nwage income in Canton, Beijing, and Suzhou\/Shanghai from the mid-eighteenth\ncentury to the 1920s is estimated. Smith\u2019s belief about the \u2018real recompence of\nlabour\u2019 is tested by comparing real wage income in these Chinese cities to their\ncounterparts in other countries. For Japan, Chinese urban incomes are compared\nto a composite picture of Kyoto and Edo (modern Tokyo) in the eighteenth and\nearly nineteenth centuries, and Tokyo for the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies, based on Bassino and Ma\u2019s study \u2018Japanese unskilled wages\u2019. Real wages\nin China are compared to those in India using the results in Allen\u2019s \u2018India in the\ngreat divergence\u2019. The perspective on Asian performance is broadened by con-\ntrasting living standards there with those in London, Amsterdam, Leipzig, and\nMilan, as worked out by Allen in \u2018Great divergence\u2019. The study concludes with a\ndiscussion of the significance of its findings for Adam Smith and the great diver-\ngence debate.\nI\nBefore comparing living standards, the level and trend of nominal wages in China\nmust be established. Since most European wages are recorded for urban labourers\nin the building industry, the present study concentrates on unskilled male workers\nin three large Chinese cities. No single source covers the whole period from the\neighteenth century to the twentieth, so the wage history of China must be pieced\ntogether by combining disparate information.7\nFor Beijing, some wages for labourers on eighteenth-century government build-\ning projects are known, and wages for similar workers from the 1860s to the 1920s\ncan be found. For Canton, wage data of unskilled port labour hired by European\ntrading companies in the eighteenth century are available. For Suzhou, the daily\nearnings of men engaged as calenderers pressing cloth in the textile industry can\nbe estimated. This series can be linked to the wages of spinners in cotton textile\nmills in Shanghai in the twentieth century. Indeed, a more complete picture of\nlabour incomes in theYangzi Delta can be developed by also assessing the earnings\nof male farm labourers, rural women spinning and weaving cotton cloth, and\npeasant households as a whole. By matching eighteenth-century wages for specific\nunskilled occupations in China with corresponding wages for the early twentieth\ncentury, the long-term history of Chinese wages can be reconstructed for com-\nparison with European wages.\nThis wage survey begins with three sets of wage data for the eighteenth century\nthat are reasonably continuous and well defined. The first set is the piece wage\nrates of the cotton calenderers inscribed on steles for crafts and commerce in\nSuzhou, the largest industrial and trading city in the Yangzi Delta during the\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries.The case of cotton calenderers and their wage\ndisputes has been the subject of numerous studies.8 The calenderers\u2019 job was \u2018to\n7 For a survey of existing studies on wages and prices, see Kishimoto, Shindai chu\u00afgoku, pp. 11\u201346.\n8 Quan, \u2018Qingdai Suzhou de chuaibuye\u2019; Terada, \u2018So\u00afshu\u00af tampogyo\u00af\u2019; Santangelo, \u2018Urban society\u2019; Xu, ed.,\nJiangnan tubu shi.\n10 ALLEN, BASSINO, MA, MOLL-MURATA, AND VAN ZANDEN\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

As these are piece wages quoted in silver\ntaels, there are no ambiguities about copper\u2013silver exchange rates or additional\nfood allowances.The major issue is the conversion of piece rates into daily wages,\nfor which Xu\u2019s study on the early twentieth century was used, as explained in\nappendix I A. Overall, the daily wages thus derived come to 0.09944 and 0.1144\nsilver taels in 1730 and 1772 respectively.\nIn the eighteenth century, the calenderers were mostly migrants to Suzhou from\nthe impoverished provinces of northern Jiangsu and Anhui.They \u2018had to be strong\nmen, considering the especially tiring nature of their job: using their arms as levers\non wooden supports while balancing, they had to rock a huge forked stone with a\nground base onto cotton cloth wrapped around a wooden roller which rotated in\na groove in the base of the stone\u2019.10 Calenderers were only a little above unskilled\nbuilding labourers but probably below a fully skilled worker in the pay scale.\nOur second source for private sector wages is the archives of the Dutch East\nIndies Company (VOC). Many VOC ships docked at Canton, which was the city\nwhere Europeans were allowed to trade with China in the eighteenth century.The\nVOC hired many Chinese workers to repair ships and move cargo. A recent study\nby van Dyke offers a detailed description of the workings of the provisioning\nsystem in Canton. From the VOC archives, 63 wage quotations spanning the\neighteenth century can be obtained.11 The wages fluctuated, but they clustered\nbetween 0.08 and 0.1 taels per day with no additional food allowances.\nThe third set of wage data comes from diverse sources. We begin with two\ngovernment regulations.The first is the Wuliao jiazhi zeli (Regulations and precedents\non the prices of materials) of 1769, which is a very detailed and systematic govern-\nment report on the prices of building materials and the wages paid at construction\nprojects, and an attempt to set these prices and wages for the future. According to\nthe editorial introduction, it contained information about 1,557 administrative\nunits described in a compilation of 220 chapters.The original compilation has not\nbeen preserved, but the editions for 15 provinces covering 945 districts are extant.\nMost of them contain the daily wages of unskilled and skilled craftsmen for each\ndistrict; a few are more detailed and present wages for occupations such as master\nsawyers, carpenters, stonemasons, paint-makers and painters, tailors, plasterers,\ncanopy makers, paperhangers, and cleaners (in Zhili). Occasionally additional\nfood provisions and their monetary value are recorded, so that the total wage value\ncan be calculated. Where no food provisions are mentioned, probably no food\nallowance was given, as these wage regulations were supposed to cover the entire\nlabour cost of these public building projects.12\n9 Santangelo, \u2018Urban society\u2019, p. 109.\n10 Ibid., p. 109.\n11 See van Dyke, Canton trade, and J\u00f6rg, Porcelain, pp. 21\u201373, for the details of the organization of the VOC in\nCanton.We specifically used the files in the National Archives of the Netherlands,The Hague, ArchivesVOC, nos.\n4373, 4376, 4378, 4381, 4382, 4386, 4388, 4390, 4392, 4395\u20134401, 4403, 4405, 4408, 4409.\n12 The introductory memorial to these regulations by the compiler Chen Hongmou, \u2018Wuliao jiazhi zonglue\u2019\n[\u2018General remarks on the prices of materials\u2019], states that market prices and wages were investigated in the\nregions, and that the prices and wages quoted in these volumes were near to market prices at low market activity;\nsee Wuliao jiazhi zeli, ch. 1, fol. 4b, available as WWW document, URL [http:\/\/www.uni-tuebingen.de\/uni\/ans\/\nproject\/shp\/zeli\/zonglue.htm] [accessed on 10 Jan. 2010].

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nregions in 1776 was about 214.5 million, or 73 per cent of the total population of\nChina of about 293 million.13\nThe pattern that emerges from the Wuliao jiazhi zeli is that daily wages in parts\nof Manchuria (Heilongjiang and Jilin), the home territory of the ruling Manchu\nDynasty, and the sparsely populated north-western frontier of Xinjiang, stand out\nas the highest, followed by areas in and near the capital city of Beijing. Average\ndaily wages in the rest of China seem to have been fairly uniform, with the coastal\nFujian province fetching the lowest, 0.030 taels for unskilled labourers.\nA second government source is the so-called Gongbu junqi zeli (Regulations and\nprecedents on weapons and military equipment by the Ministry of PublicWorks) of 1813,\nwhich contains more government wage regulations on an empire-wide scale. The\nGongbu junqi zeli contains wages for master artisans and unskilled labour that\nproduced military equipment. This dataset includes information for skilled and\nunskilled labourers.14 This source shows again that, with the exception of Zhili\nwhere Beijing is situated, the norm for average daily wages of unskilled labourers\nin most provinces in 1813 was about 0.04 taels, very close to that in the 1769\nregulations.\nExtreme caution should be exercised in the interpretation of these government\ndata. The Wuliao jiazhi zeli wage data collected at the county level often show\nidentical wages across a vast number of counties within one province, with little\ndistinction between the more and less urbanized ones. This poses the question\nwhether these data reflect actual market conditions or rather government policies,\nwhich tended to favour the capital region as well as Manchuria, the home territory\nof the Qing rulers.15\nTo tackle the question of how accurately these government regulated wages\napproximate wages in the private sector of the economy, we place these wage series\nagainst a broader dataset of 264 scattered wage quotations from many sources and\nfor different parts of China. The problem with these disparate wages from the\nprivate sector is a lack of the kind of detailed information available for the Suzhou\ncalenderers and Canton VOC labourers. Also, there is a general lack of compara-\nbility due to the multiplicity of labour contracts, payment systems, and currency\nunits. Employment contracts could last for a day, a month, or a year, and careful\nattention must be given to the number of days worked in a month or a year to\nreduce the payment information to a consistent daily rate. There are many cases\nfor which food allowances were given in addition to cash payments. Possibly the\nmost difficult issue of all is the quotation of wages in different currency units\n(copper coins, silver taels) with exchange values that were both highly localized\nand fluctuating over time. Studies not taking full cognizance of these problems can\nbe very misleading.16\n13 Wang, Land taxation, p. 87.\n14 See You, \u2018Lun junqi zeli\u2019, p. 314. Wages of skilled craftsmen were 0.020 or 0.010 taels higher than those of\nunskilled labourers.\n15 The Qing government restricted the migration of Han Chinese to the land and resource rich, but labour-\nscarce region of Manchuria until the mid-nineteenth century.\n16 Vogel, \u2018Chinese central monetary policy\u2019, contains the most comprehensive collection of market exchange\nrates for various provinces in China for the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, but these exchange rates do not\napply to the case of the co-circulation of multiple versions of silver and copper cash within the same locality, an\nissue pointed out in Kuroda\u2019s recent study, \u2018Copper coins\u2019.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nThe most important official source for private wages consulted in the present\nstudy is the records of the imperial Ministry of Justice, which summarized judicial\ncases dealing with wage payment. A sample of 188 manufacturing and handicraft\nwages was obtained from Peng\u2019s compilation on craft history, which is based on\njudicial records from c. 1740 to 1820.17 They are contained in the archival\ndocuments of the Ministry of Justice, Qingdai xingbu chao\u2019an (Copies of archival\nmaterials from the Qing Ministry of Justice).18 This represents a widespread sample\nwhich includes scattered wage data for different occupations, in different regions,\nusing different means of payment (silver taels or copper coins), covering different\ntime periods (per day, month, or year), and spread over a long period.The Ministry\nof Justice records also contain samples of agricultural wages.These are available in\nthe work of Wei and Wu.19\nThe resulting large, if disparate, sample of wages covers many provinces, indus-\ntries, and types of employment in eighteenth-century China. To extract basic\npatterns from this information, a wage function was estimated using all of the\ncollected wages, including the VOC and government regulation wages. All wages\nwere converted to daily wages in silver taels by means ofVogel\u2019s regional dataset of\nsilver\u2013copper conversion ratios.20\nThe following independent variables were defined: (1) regions: Manchuria,\nZhili, the north (Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong), the Yangzi Delta (Jiangsu\nand Zhejiang), the \u2018middle\u2019, and the south (see table 1 for the exact specification\nof the regions; Canton is also distinguished separately); (2) branches (agriculture,\ncoal mining, the iron industry, construction, textiles, and other industries); (3) a\ntime-trend with 1700 as the base year; (4) skill (a dummy for skilled labour was\nused; unskilled labourers were all agricultural workers, the unskilled labourers in\nconstruction and the \u2018helpers\u2019 in other industries); (5) regulation (data drawn from\nthe two government documents Wuliao jiazhi zeli (1769) and Gongbu junqi zeli\n(1813) were identified by a dummy for \u2018regulation\u2019). We also include a few\nadditional government regulation data from Suzhou zizhao ju zhi (1686) and Da\nQing huidian shili (for 1723 and 1736).21\nThe total number of observations was 327, relatively equally spread over the\ndifferent regions and branches. There are only four observations for the late\nseventeenth century. Most observations cluster between the 1740s and the 1810s;\nno observations after 1820 were included.\n17 Peng, Zhongguo jindai shougongye, vol. 1, pp. 396\u2013414.\n18 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 397, n. 2.\n19 Wei, \u2018Ming-Qing\u2019; Wu, \u2018Qing\u2019.\n20 Vogel, \u2018Chinese central monetary policy\u2019. Another problem was how to convert monthly and annual wages\ninto daily wages; a few observations of both daily and monthly or annual wages suggests conversion factors of\nabout 15 (days\/month) and 60 (days\/year). The next step was to use these conversion factors and estimate\ndummies for monthly and annual wages in the wage regression. The dummies became close to zero when\nsomewhat different conversion factors were used, namely 13 and 90. We used these conversion factors in the\nestimation of wage levels in the wage regressions shown in tab. 1; therefore, the dummies for monthly and annual\nwages have not been included.\n21 Wage data from Suzhou zizhao ju zhi (Treatise on the Suzhou weaving offices) for 1686, included in Peng,\nZhongguo jindai shougongye, vol. 1, pp. 90\u20132, were also consulted, as well as wage data from Da Qing huidian shili,\nch. 952, fos. 4b\u20135a, pp. 16,640\u20131. The complete wage dataset used in this study can be found at http:\/\/\nwww.iisg.nl\/hpw\/data.php#china; it presents an overview of the different datasets, their compilers (Christine\nMoll-Murata, Debin Ma, and Paul van Dyke), and the linked Excel files.\n14 ALLEN, BASSINO, MA, MOLL-MURATA, AND VAN ZANDEN\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors. The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nTable 2 presents the results of the wage regression. All independent variables\nexcept the time trend are dummies for regions, branches, and so on; the standard\nfor comparison is the market wage of a construction labourer in the Yangzi Delta\nin 1700. The constant in the equation is his wage, which is estimated as 0.0456\ntaels.The regional pattern mirrors the results from the analysis of the Wuliao jiazhi\nzeli: wages in Manchuria and Zhili were (much) higher than in the rest of the\ncountry, whereas the differences between theYangzi Delta and the rest of the rice\nregion were very small. Most industry dummies were insignificant. Finally, the\ndummy for skill premium is significant; its level in regression is 63 per cent of the\nwage of an unskilled labourer in the Yangzi Delta.\nTo get a perspective on our wage regression, we plotted in figure 1 the wage rates\nof Suzhou and Canton against the predicted wages from our regression. Figure 1\nshows that the baseline predicted wages, set as the constant plus the time trend in\nthe wage regression (the rate equivalent to that of an unskilled labourer in the\nYangzi Delta), is about half the level of Suzhou and Canton wages.WhileVOC and\ncalenderers\u2019 wages were rising gently, wages in China in general were declining\nslowly, as indicated by the wage equation.This difference in trend is not significant\nfor our purpose. Figure 1 also plots the predicted wages of Beijing which uses the\ndummy coefficients for Zhili from the wage regression.\nThese results make sense: large cities in Europe, the counterparts of Canton,\nSuzhou, and Beijing, had higher wages than small towns and rural districts in part\nbecause the cost of living was higher in the large cities and also because they had\nto recruit population from the countryside. This conjecture is in agreement with\nPomeranz\u2019s description of the earnings of aYangzi Delta farm worker employed by\nthe year in the mid-eighteenth century. Pomeranz reckoned that the cash compo-\nnent of these earnings was two to five taels, and that the food allowance over a full\nTable 2.

Dividing by 360 implies daily earnings of 0.035 to 0.045\ntaels per day, very close to the baseline wage level from our regression result.22\nAs the wage regression contains some wage data that might include additional\nfood allowances, we have experimented with alternative regressions by adding\n0.024 taels\u2014roughly the cost of one kilogram of rice in Canton or millet in Beijing\nin the middle of the eighteenth century\u2014to the daily earnings of those workers\nearning less than six taels per year (0.5 taels per month).The alternative regression\nleads to changes of little significance to the coefficients of most significance for this\nstudy.\nThe level of our baseline wage in figure 1 matches the empire-wide averages in the\nWuliao jiazhi zeli and Gongbu junqi zeli in the official regulation data.This leads us to\n22 Pomeranz, Great divergence, pp. 319\u201320.The average of agricultural wages on daily contracts collected in our\nsample was 0.045 taels.Wages on daily contract were likely to be higher, as usually day labourers were more often\nemployed during the planting and harvest seasons. It is unclear whether additional food was provided. A national\nlevel survey conducted by Chen in the 1930s, Gesheng nonggong, reveals the existence of both types of payment\narrangements for daily wages, either with or without food payment, the latter being higher. However, in cases\nwhere there was food payment, the portion amounted to about 33 per cent of the total cash wage, much less than\nfor the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century agricultural wages on annual contracts (Chen, Gesheng nonggong, p. 9).\nLi, Agricultural development, p. 94, also seems to indicate that seventeenth-century nominal wage levels may not\nbe far apart from those of the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries. He discusses wage levels in agriculture and silk\nproduction in theYangzi Delta, and estimates the average wage in rice cultivation at 0.06 taels per day, adding \u2018the\nofficial standard was 0.04 taels a day which is a bit low compared to the wages in some farms in Huzhou, Zhejiang\nprovince\u2019.\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n17\n38\n17\n42\n17\n46\n17\n50\n17\n54\n17\n58\n17\n62\n17\n66\n17\n70\n17\n74\n17\n78\n17\n82\n17\n86\n17\n90\n17\n94\n17\n98\n18\n02\n18\n06\n18\n10\n18\n14\n18\n18\nSuzhou Canton\nBeijing (predicted) Baseline (predicted)\nFigure 1.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nbelieve that the government regulation wages may have been set as a wage floor for\nthe market wages, which the government used for the purpose of cost-accounting.\nBoth these sources also reveal higher wage levels for the capital region than the\nnational average, which may be a reflection of possible governmental discrimina-\ntion. If carefully interpreted, the regulated wage is more useful as a benchmark for\na national wage floor than as an indication of regional wage patterns. For the\nsubsequent analysis, the wage level for Beijing and Canton was set in 1700, based on\nthe predicted values in the regression of 0.0897 and 0.0835 taels respectively, equal\nto the constant coefficients plus dummy coefficients for Zhili and Canton respec-\ntively. For Suzhou, 0.09 taels for 1700 were used, very close to the 0.0968 taels for\nthe calenderers\u2019 wages.The national trend level was used for all these three series in\nthe international comparison. Clearly, we view our wage series as more reliable in\nindicating long-term trends than short-term fluctuations.\nSomewhat contrary to the claims that Lower Yangzi had the highest living\nstandards, our dataset collected at this stage do not reveal a higher nominal wage\nfor unskilled laborers in that region. While the implications of possible regional\nwage difference will be discussed later (in particular, see footnote 54), the rest of\nthis study focuses on cross-national comparison of average wage income for\nunskilled labourers between China and Europe. On the assumption that these\nwages are complete payments for unskilled labourers in the three major urban\ncentres, they most likely represent the upper bound estimates of our larger dataset.\nThus, if the average level turns out to be lower than our nominal wages, then actual\nChinese living standards would be even lower.\nII\nJumping forward in time, the best available information on wages in Beijing,\nCanton, and Shanghai is for the early twentieth century. Our wage series for\nBeijing is anchored in the work of Sidney Gamble (1890\u20131968). Gamble was an\nAmerican sociologist who lived in China in the 1920s and 1930s. He conducted a\nsurvey of workers in Beijing in 1921. This provided the weights for a consumer\nprice index for Chinese capital for 1900\u201324, and that index, in turn, was used in\na study of real wages for the period. Gamble and his associates also recorded wage\nseries for unskilled construction workers in Beijing for the period 1862\u20131925 using\nthe records of the Beijing guilds for construction workers. This is our source for\nunskilled wages in the capital.23\nGamble carried out another important study based on the account books of a\nfuel store in the rural area of Beijing.The information runs from 1807 to 1902 and\nis possibly the only consistent wage series for nineteenth-century China. The\nnineteenth-century wage payments were recorded in copper cash and were broken\naround the mid-nineteenth century due to the monetary debasement in the period\nof the Taiping Rebellion. Gamble does provide vital information on copper\u2013silver\nrates in that area from which we derive a silver-based wage series for 1807\u20131902,\n23 This series is composed of two parts. The first part is the 1870\u20131900 copper cash wages (inclusive of food\nmoney) in Gamble, \u2018Daily wages\u2019, p. 66, which we converted to silver wages using copper\u2013silver rates from Peng\n(Zhongguo huobi shi, p. 548). The second series is the 1900\u201324 series by Meng and Gamble, \u2018Wages, prices, and\nthe standard of living\u2019, p. 100.\nLIVING STANDARDS IN CHINA 17\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors. The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nas shown in appendix I B. The level of the wage rates seems very low and is\ndifficult to interpret in its own right, as Gamble indicated that workers received\nunrecorded food allowances.24 We apply the trend (not the levels) of these silver\nwages to fill in the 1820\u201362 gap for the light it throws on theTaiping Rebellion and\nits aftermath.\nInformation on Cantonese wages is less comprehensive than that for Beijing. As\nnoted above, estimates of wages in the eighteenth century have been derived\nmainly from VOC records and summarized in the wage regression. For the early\ntwentieth century, the simple average of six series of union-regulated shows wage\nrates for unskilled labourers in the construction sector from 1912 to 1927 is\nused.25 For the nineteenth century, various plausible wage data exist, but were not\nincluded in the analysis as they were incomplete and scattered.\nSimilarly, no systematic wage series for Suzhou in the nineteenth century was\navailable. From the middle of the nineteenth century, Shanghai was emerging as\nChina\u2019s predominant trading and industrial city under the treaty port system\nimposed by western imperialism. Setting out from wage notations for female\ncotton spinners in Shanghai between 1910 and 1934, we have calculated the wage\nlevels of male unskilled labourers based on a wage survey of the 1930s.26\nIII\nAdam Smith thought that the \u2018money price of labour\u2019 was higher in Europe than\nin China. To test that, Chinese and European wages must be compared. Building\non our earlier studies of European daily wage rates earned by labourers in the\nbuilding industry,27 we have been careful to exclude wage quotations where the\nearnings included food or other payment in kind that could not be valued and\nadded to the money wage. As with China, we have converted the European wages\nto grams of silver per day by using the market price (in units of account) at which\nsilver coins of known weight and fineness could be purchased.\nFigures 2 and 3 show the daily wage rates of unskilled workers in London,\nAmsterdam, Leipzig, Milan, Beijing, and Kyoto\/Tokyo from the eighteenth century\nto the twentieth.Figure 2 shows the series from 1738 to 1870.For this period,Adam\nSmith was half right.Wages were, indeed, highest in London and lowest in Beijing,\nbut the other series show that the world was more complex than Smith thought.The\nsilver wage in Milan or Leipzig was not appreciably higher than the wage in Beijing,\nCanton, or Suzhou throughout the eighteenth century.28 The statistics of other\nEuropean and Chinese cities show that this similarity was general.\n24 Gamble, \u2018Daily wages\u2019, p. 41.\n25 Department of Peasantry and Labour, Reports of statistics, vol. 3, \u2018Wage tables in the construction sector\u2019. Our\nwage series is the simple average of five types of unskilled labourers in the construction sector.\n26 We make use of the series by Rawski, Economic growth, p. 301, and the Bureau of Social Affairs, Cost of living\nindex, pp. iii\u2013iv. According to Yang, \u2018Shanghai gongren shenghuo\u2019, p. 250, female workers in 1927\u20138 were paid\nabout 80% of the level of male workers.\n27 van Zanden, \u2018Wages and the standards of living\u2019; Allen, \u2018Great divergence\u2019.\n28 As indicated earlier in section I and in fig. 1, the silver wages we used for Beijing, Canton, and Suzhou\/\nShanghai are broadly equal. For reasons of easy visibility, we only plot the silver wage for the Beijing series on\nfigs. 2 and 3.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nAmsterdam occupies a peculiar position in figure 2. Nominal wages there were\nremarkably constant for a century and a half. At the outset the Amsterdam wage\nwas similar to the London wage. The same was true of Antwerp. Indeed, the\nLow Countries and the London region stand out from the rest of Europe for\ntheir high wages in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These high wages\nwere probably due to the active involvement of these regions in intercontinental\ncommerce. However, this pattern changed as the nineteenth century advanced.\nThe industrial revolution raised British wages above Dutch levels. Indeed, the\nearly industrialization of Germany is seen in figure 2 as a rise in the Leipzig\nwage.\nThese developments intensified after 1870, as shown in figure 3. British wages\ncontinued to increase. By the First World War, German wages had caught up with\nthe British level, and Dutch wages closed the gap as well. Italian wages were also\ngrowing, but the increase was muted compared to the industrial core of Europe.\nOutside Europe, Japanese wages before 1870 stayed largely flat, in keeping with\nthe low Italian level. After 1890, Japanese wages, spurred by the industrialization\ndrive in the Meiji era, began to rise, but continued to stay substantially below the\nrising trend of early twentieth-century European wages.\nChinese wages, in contrast, changed little over the entire period. There was\nsome increase in the silver wage after 1870, but figure 3 emphasizes that the gain\nwas of little importance from a global perspective. By the First World War,\nnominal wages in China were very much lower than wages in Europe generally.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n17\n38\n17\n44\n17\n50\n17\n56\n17\n62\n17\n68\n17\n74\n17\n80\n17\n86\n17\n92\n17\n98\n18\n04\n18\n10\n18\n16\n18\n22\n18\n28\n18\n34\n18\n40\n18\n46\n18\n52\n18\n58\n18\n64\n18\n70\nLondon\nAmsterdam\nLeipzig\nMilan\nBeijing\nKyoto\/Tokyo\nFigure 2.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nTaken at face value, Adam Smith\u2019s generalization about Chinese and European\nwages was more accurate at the time of the First World War than when he\npenned it in 1776.\nIV\nWhat of Adam Smith\u2019s second generalization? He remarked that \u2018the difference\nbetween the price of subsistence in China and in Europe is very great\u2019.29 This\ngeneralization can be tested by computing price indices. We have tried many\nformulae and sets of weights, and the reassuring result is that our conclusions about\nrelative real wages do not depend in any important way on the choice of price index.\nThe index number problem is a difficult one, since diet and lifestyle were\nradically different in different parts of Eurasia. How precisely does the real income\nof an English worker who consumed beef, bread, and beer compare to that of a\nChinese labourer who ate rice and fish?\nThe approach considered in this section takes Adam Smith\u2019s comment as its\npoint of departure. His generalization about price levels is expressed in terms of\nthe \u2018price of subsistence\u2019.We operationalize that by defining consumption baskets\nthat represent the \u2018bare bones\u2019 minimum for survival (see tables 3\u20134).The baskets\n29 Smith, Wealth of nations, p. 189.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n18\n71\n18\n73\n18\n75\n18\n77\n18\n79\n18\n81\n18\n83\n18\n85\n18\n87\n18\n89\n18\n91\n18\n93\n18\n95\n18\n97\n18\n99\n19\n01\n19\n03\n19\n05\n19\n07\n19\n09\n19\n11\n19\n13\nLondon\nAmsterdam\nLeipzig\nMilan\nBeijing\nTokyo\nFigure 3.

Polenta (closely followed by rice) is the least\nnutritious source of calories in this regard. Non-food items include some cloth and\nfuel. The magnitudes of the non-food items were also suggested by the Japanese\nand Chinese consumption surveys of the interwar period. It would have been hard\nfor a person to survive on less than the cost of one of these baskets.\nHaving specified the consumption \u2018baskets\u2019 in tables 3\u20134, time series of the\nprices of the items shown are necessary, so that the cost of the baskets can be\ncalculated across the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. For Europe,\nthe prices described in Allen\u2019s \u2018Great divergence\u2019 can be applied.31 New databases\nwere compiled for the Chinese cities under observation. For Beijing, we extended\nGamble\u2019s retail prices for 1900\u201324 back to 1738.32 Food prices were extended\nusing wholesale agricultural prices for Zhili province compiled by Li.33 The\nimplicit assumption in these extrapolations was that the ratio of retail to wholesale\nprices remained constant. The details and the procedures for cloth and fuel are\nexplained in appendix II. For Shanghai and Canton, twentieth-century retail\nprices were extracted from official sources.34 For the eighteenth century, Wang\u2019s\nYangzi Delta rice price series was used for Suzhou and Chen\u2019s series for Guang-\ndong.35 These are probably wholesale rather than retail prices. No allowance was\nmade for retail mark-ups\u2014a procedure which is again biased against our conclu-\nsions, for if rice prices in China were higher then living standards would have been\neven lower. The prices of other foods and fuel were taken from the costs incurred\nby European trading companies in provisioning their ships in Canton.These prices\nhave been compared to the estimated prices for Beijing, and the agreement is\nclose. For most of the eighteenth century, competition was intense in supplying\nthese ships.36\nThe cost of the basket is Adam Smith\u2019s \u2018money price of subsistence\u2019, and its\nhistory is plotted in figure 4 for leading cities in China and Europe in the eigh-\nteenth and nineteenth centuries. The findings would have surprised Smith, for it\ncontradicts his claim that China had cheaper subsistence than Europe. The silver\ncost of a \u2018bare bones\u2019 basket in Beijing or Suzhou was in the middle of the\nEuropean range. A corollary is that the silver prices of grains, which dominate the\ncost of these indices, were similar across Eurasia. Another casualty of figure 4 is\n30 Department of Crop Reporting, Division of Agricultural Economics, The National Agricultural Research\nBureau (NARB), China, Crop reports, vol. 5, issues 7 and 8; Ro\u00afdo\u00af undo\u00af shiryo\u00af iinkai, Nihon ro\u00afdo\u00af, p. 568.\nAlternative baskets constructed on the basis of these surveys can also be found in our earlier working paper, R.\nC.

The figure shows very little\ndifference between the two consumer price indices for both Beijing and Suzhou\/\nShanghai (or Canton, not shown in the figure) for the eighteenth century. These\ntwo cities represent the two agrarian halves of China\u2014the northern small grain\nregion and the southern rice region. However, from the beginning of the eigh-\nteenth century, rice prices began a secular rise over those of sorghum, which led to\na somewhat more expensive basket for the unskilled labourers in the south than in\nthe north.While the implication of this finding needs further research, this differ-\nence matters little for our purpose of international comparison. Overall, as seen in\nfigure 4, price gaps between Europe and China really opened up from about the\nmid-nineteenth century.\nV\nBefore considering the implications of the cost of the baskets for comparative\nliving standards, the results of indexing prices in other ways can be briefly\nsummarized.\n37 Smith, Wealth of nations, p. 189.\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n17\n38\n17\n46\n17\n54\n17\n62\n17\n70\n17\n78\n17\n86\n17\n94\n18\n02\n18\n10\n18\n18\n18\n26\n18\n34\n18\n42\n18\n50\n18\n58\n18\n66\n18\n74\n18\n82\n18\n90\n18\n98\n19\n06\nLondon\nLeipzig\nBeijing\nSuzhou\/Shanghai\nFigure 4.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nIn modern theory, the index number problem unfolds thus. Suppose an indi-\nvidual or family receives a particular income and faces particular prices. The\nincome and prices determine the maximum level of utility (highest indifference\ncurve) that the individual can reach. Now suppose that prices change. What\nproportional change in income would allow the individual to reach the original\nindifference curve in the new price situation? The price index is supposed to\nanswer that question. Comparing the actual change in income to the index shows\nwhether consumer welfare has risen or fallen.\nThere are no insuperable difficulties in applying the theory to real income\nchanges over time in either Europe or Asia, provided full information about wages,\nconsumer prices, and spending patterns is available.Yet how can living standards\nbetween Europe and Asia be compared? The pattern of goods\u2014particularly\nfoods\u2014consumed in the two regions was radically different. The standard theory\nof consumer welfare assumes that all the goods are available in both regions and\nthat there is a \u2018representative agent\u2019 who would voluntarily choose to consume rice,\nfish, and sake when confronted with Asian prices and bread, beef, and beer when\nconfronted with English prices. In fact, all goods were not available everywhere,\nand, moreover, it is unlikely that there were people flexible enough to shift their\nconsumption voluntarily between the European and the Asian patterns in response\nto the difference in prices. This is the reason why we approached the problem in\nterms of Adam Smith\u2019s \u2018cost of subsistence\u2019. By building on the results of these\ncalculations, the outcome of a more orthodox approach can be approximated.\nDuring the comparative process, the associated data problems come sharply into\nfocus.We concentrate on a comparison of Beijing and London because the Beijing\ndiet was based on small grains that were more comparable than rice to English\ngrains.\nWe first approach the question from the point of view of a Beijing resident and\nask how much it would have cost to live the \u2018bare bones\u2019 Beijing lifestyle in\nLondon.This is the pertinent question, for the typical labourer could not afford to\nbuy anything more. The difficulty is that we cannot cost out the Beijing basket in\nLondon, for sorghum was not sold in London. However, oats were the counterpart\nof sorghum in Britain\u2014it was the least costly, most inferior grain\u2014and if we take\noats and sorghum to be equivalent, we realize that we have already answered the\nquestion by comparing the cost of the \u2018bare bones\u2019 baskets.\nWe can also ask how much the London lifestyle would have cost in Beijing.That\nlifestyle is represented by the \u2018respectable\u2019 consumption basket in table 5, which\nsummarizes spending in north-western Europe.38 The diet is late medieval in\ninspiration, in that it does not contain new commodities like sugar and potatoes\nintroduced into Europe after the voyages of discovery.\nThe basket in table 5 contains important items for which we lack prices in\nChina. Bread is the most important, and we have estimated what bread would have\nsold for, had it been produced commercially, from Allen\u2019s \u2018bread equation\u2019.39 This\nis a statistical relationship between bread prices, wheat prices, and wage rates\nprevailing in many cities in Europe. Since we have time series of wages and wheat\nprices for Zhili province, which includes Beijing, the price at which bread would\n38 Allen, \u2018Great divergence\u2019, pp. 420\u20131.\n39 Ibid., p. 418.\n24 ALLEN, BASSINO, MA, MOLL-MURATA, AND VAN ZANDEN\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors. The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nhave been supplied had it been produced in the European manner can be calcu-\nlated. Likewise, the price of beer is unknown. For it, we substituted the quantity of\nrice wine (sake) that contained the same quantity of alcohol.40 We estimated the\nprice of rice wine using the Japanese relationship between the retail price of sake\nand the wholesale price of rice. In this way we proxied the missing prices needed\nto cost out a European basket in Beijing.\nThe European and Beijing baskets define Paasche and Laspeyres price indices.\nThe final step in comparing the cost of living in London and Beijing is to compute\nthe geometric average of the two, which is a Fisher Ideal Price index. This is a\n\u2018superlative\u2019 price index, which corresponds to a generalized Leontief expenditure\nfunction.41 That representation of consumer preferences has the property that\nindifference curves are tangent to prices at both consumption patterns. In other\nwords, the representative consumer whose behaviour is summarized by the price\nindex would shift from an English to a Chinese spending pattern as prices shifted\nfrom the London to the Chinese configuration. Using this index number imposes\nthe assumptions of modern theory on the reality of eighteenth-century\nbehaviour\u2014certainly a debatable procedure.\nHow does the Fisher Ideal Price index compare to the \u2018bare bones\u2019 indices? In\nfact, they are very similar.The relative cost of the European basket in London and\nBeijing was always close to the relative cost of the \u2018bare bones\u2019 baskets, which are\nequal to ratios of 1.12 and 1.17 respectively in table 5. Hence, their geometric\naverage is also similar. Consequently, a superlative index number, in this case, gives\n40 182 litres of beer at 4.5% alcohol contain as much alcohol as 41 litres of sake at 20%.\n41 Diewert, \u2018Exact and superlative index numbers\u2019.The use of alternative consumption baskets for Canton and\nJapan based on comparable calories and protein contents also confirm the findings here; see Allen et al., \u2018Wages,\nprices, and living standards\u2019 (see above, n. 30).\nTable 5.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nthe same result as a comparison of Smith\u2019s \u2018cost of subsistence\u2019. Since the latter\nhas so many intuitive interpretations, we use it as the axis of our discussion in the\nconfidence that it is not misleading us when the index number problem is con-\nsidered from other perspectives.\nVI\nThe purchasing power of wages is usually measured by the ratio of the wage to the\nconsumer price index. Our procedure elaborates that approach. In constructing\nthe consumer price index, a notional budget was specified that represented the\nleast costly way to survive (tables 3 and 4, however, do not include housing costs,\nso we increase them now by 5 per cent, which is a minimal allowance for rent).The\nbudget was an annual budget for an adult male. If the man supported a family, the\nexpenditures would have been higher, so that the cost of the budget (augmented\nby 5 per cent for rent) was multiplied by three to represent the annual budget of\na family. This increase is roughly in line with the calorie norms for a man, a\nwoman, and two young children.42 On the income side, our income measure is the\nannual earnings that a worker could have gained if he worked full time for a year.\nWe assume that one year\u2019s work consisted of 250 days\u2014roughly full-time work\nallowing for holidays, illness, and slack periods. The earnings from full-time work\nprovide a useful benchmark for comparing Europe and Asia and for defining the\neconomic strategies of families. The ratio of estimated full-time earnings to the\nannual cost of the family budget is a real wage index.\nOur real wage index has a particular interpretation since it answers a specific\nquestion, namely, whether a man working full time could support a family at the\n\u2018bare bones\u2019 level of consumption. Real wage indices of this sort are called \u2018welfare\nratios\u2019. When the welfare ratio equalled one, an unskilled labourer working full\ntime could earn just enough to support his family at subsistence level. Higher\nvalues indicate some surplus, while values below one mean either that the family\nsize had to be reduced or work effort had to be increased since there was little\nscope for reducing expenditure.\nFigures 5 and 6 show welfare ratios for unskilled male workers from 1738 to\n1923 in the European cities we discussed and the Chinese cities. Several features\nstand out. Firstly, as shown in figure 6, theYangzi Delta is reputed to have had the\nmost advanced economy of any Chinese province, but the real wage there was not\nnoticeably higher than the real wage in Beijing or Canton, as we will see. Secondly,\nthe Chinese cities were in a tie for last place with the Italian cities, which had the\nlowest standard of living in Europe, so an optimistic assessment of China\u2019s per-\nformance is difficult. Thirdly, the existing information about Beijing wages in the\nnineteenth century indicates that the real wage continued to slide until theTaiping\nRebellion in mid-century, when it reached a life-threateningly low level. After\nauthority was restored, living standards improved slowly into the early twentieth\ncentury. Fourthly, the most striking feature of figures 5 and 6 is the great lead in\nliving standards enjoyed by workers in the rapidly growing parts of western\nEurope.The standard of living of workers in London was always much higher than\n42 Precisely, two children aged 1\u20133 and 4\u20136 respectively.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nthat of workers in Beijing or the Yangzi Delta. After the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury, London living standards began an upward trajectory and increased their\nlead over China.While workers in Amsterdam in the eighteenth century also lived\nbetter than their counterparts in Beijing, the Dutch economy faltered in the early\nnineteenth century.43 By mid-century, however, growth resumed and real wages\nwere climbing to new heights. At the same time, the rapid growth of the German\neconomy was translating into rising real wages for workers in Leipzig. By the First\nWorld War, the standard of living of workers in the industrial core of western\nEurope had greatly increased over their counterparts in Beijing and Suzhou. The\nstandard of living in China remained low and on a par with the regions of Europe\nuntouched by the industrial revolution. Fifthly, the workers in north-western\nEurope with welfare ratios of four or more did not eat four times as much oatmeal\nas their \u2018bare bones\u2019 diet presupposes. Instead, they ate higher-quality food\u2014beef,\nbeer, and bread\u2014that was a more expensive source of calories. In addition, they\nbought a wide range of non-food items. In the eighteenth century, these included\nthe Asian imports and novel manufactures that comprised the \u2018consumer revolu-\ntion\u2019 of that era. By the same token, workers in north-western Europe could afford\nthe basket of goods shown in table 5, while workers in Asia could not, and had to\nsubsist on the \u2018bare bones\u2019 baskets. After all, in regions of settled agriculture, the\n43 van Zanden and van Riel, Strictures, pp. 121\u201330, pp. 188\u201391.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n17\n38\n17\n45\n17\n52\n17\n59\n17\n66\n17\n73\n17\n80\n17\n87\n17\n94\n18\n01\n18\n08\n18\n15\n18\n22\n18\n29\n18\n36\n18\n43\n18\n50\n18\n57\n18\n64\n18\n71\n18\n78\n18\n85\n18\n92\n18\n99\n19\n06\n19\n13\nLondon Amsterdam\nLeipzig Milan\nBeijing\nFigure 5.

In northern Britain, the poorest people ate oat porridge; in the Yangzi\nDelta, they ate wheat gruel.44\nFigure 6 tests the generality of these conclusions by including all of the Asian\nwelfare ratios for comparison. There was variation in experience, but that variety\ndoes not qualify the conclusion that Asian living standards were at the low end of\nthe European range. The history of living standards in Japan, India, and Canton\nwas very similar to that of Beijing or Suzhou. Real wages in Istanbul, as shown by\n\u00d6zmucur and Pamuk, were at a level as low as China\u2019s, so it may have character-\nized much of the non-industrializing world in the eighteenth century.45 There is\nevidence of rising living standards across Asia after 1870, but the gains were not\nenough to catch up to the standard of mid-eighteenth-century London or Amster-\ndam, let alone the much higher standard of living enjoyed by workers in those cities\nin the early twentieth century.\nFigure 6 broadens our comparison by inserting the welfare ratio of Oxford, with\nthe view that London may be exceptional in terms of real wages among English\ntowns. Indeed, real wages in Oxford were always lower than in London, although\nthe gap narrowed from the late eighteenth century.46 Nonetheless, at a welfare ratio\nbetween 2.5 and 3.0 during the eighteenth century, Oxford still seemed far more\n44 Li, Agricultural development, p. 207, n. 25.\n45 \u00d6zmucur and Pamuk, \u2018Real wages\u2019.\n46 For welfare ratios in Oxford and other towns in England, see Allen, \u2018Great divergence\u2019, pp. 415\u201316.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n17\n38\n17\n46\n17\n54\n17\n62\n17\n70\n17\n78\n17\n86\n17\n94\n18\n02\n18\n10\n18\n18\n18\n26\n18\n34\n18\n42\n18\n50\n18\n58\n18\n66\n18\n74\n18\n82\n18\n90\n18\n98\n19\n06\nLondon Oxford\nBeijing Suzhou\/Shanghai\nCanton Kyoto\/Tokyo\nBengal\nFigure 6.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nprosperous than Beijing. London (the capital and a major port) and other big cities\nwere chosen because they are comparable to Beijing (the capital) and Canton (a\nmajor port), which are likely to be at the top of the wage scale in their country or\nregion. Oxford, meanwhile, ranked much lower on the urban hierarchies com-\npared with the cities in our study. Thus, the inclusion of Oxford as a robustness\ncheck assured us that our finding is not driven by the relative position of London.\nA more important question is how representative wages are of labour incomes in\nChina in general. Our knowledge of labour market conditions and the extent of\nregional migration seem to substantiate the view that wage rates may serve as a\nreasonable proxy for the average earnings of a particular socio-economic group as\nwell as the marginal productivity of labour in the economy as a whole. The\nexistence of a vibrant and active labour market, particularly for short-term or day\nlabour, in early modern China (and Japan) is well documented, although the\nprecise proportion remains elusive.47 For the early twentieth century, which shared\nmuch of the institutional and economic continuities of the eighteenth and nine-\nteenth centuries, large-scale household surveys reveal, for example, that between\n30 and 50 per cent of rural households in the 1930s Wuxi county in the Yangzi\nDelta region hired day labourers during peak season, whereas the long-term labour\nmarket was extremely thin. Furthermore, those households whose main income\nderived from farm labour fetched an average income 20 per cent below the mean\nper capita income of all the Wuxi households.This income distance of 20 per cent\nfrom the mean shows that agricultural day labourers were at the lower end\u2014but\nnot a marginal fringe\u2014of the income ladder.48\nSecondly, at least for the commercialized regions near the major urban centres,\nevidence of a relatively high degree of integration of labour markets between urban\nand rural areas can be perceived. As noted earlier, most calenderers in Suzhou\nwere migrant workers from the relatively impoverished rural Northern Jiangsu.\nSimilarly for the Beijing wage series, Gamble\u2019s detailed study reminds us of the\nclose linkage between urban and rural wages in the nineteenth century. Indeed, if\nlabour market and regional labour migration in eighteenth-century China were as\nflexible as claimed by the revisionists, there is all the more reason to believe that the\nwage rates for unskilled labourers we measure are representative of labour earnings\nfor a substantial part of the population at the relatively low end of income\ndistribution.49\nOur notional wage income can be directly compared with the labour income\ndata cited by Pomeranz and Li when they in fact argue the reverse case, namely,\nthat labouring people in theYangzi Delta had a high standard of living. Pomeranz,\n47 The literature on the prevalence of labour employment and contracts in Ming and Qing China is voluminous.\nExamples of this literature can be seen in Pomeranz, Great divergence, pp. 81\u20132, and Huang, Peasant family,\npp. 58\u201362. Wei, \u2018Ming-Qing\u2019, documents in detail the improved legal status of labourers towards the eighteenth\ncentury.\n48 For information on the labour market in north China and theYangzi Delta, see Huang, Peasant family, p. 110.\nTheWuxi survey summary can be found in Kung, Lee, and Bai, \u2018Human capital\u2019, tabs. 1 and 2. For a nationwide\nsurvey of the labour market in the 1930s, see Chen, Gesheng nonggong. Similar labour market and income\ndistribution can also be found inTokugawa Japan. Bassino, Ma, and Saito, \u2018Level of real wages\u2019, calculate that the\nwelfare ratios of the wage earnings of farm labourers were roughly equivalent to those of tenant cultivators who,\nin turn, were about 20% below those of the median class.\n49 For linkage between urban and rural wages, see Gamble, \u2018Daily wages\u2019, p. 67. See Pomeranz, Great divergence,\nch. 2, for an argument on the flexibility of product and factor markets and labour migration in early modern\nChina.\nLIVING STANDARDS IN CHINA 29\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Using average prices for\n1745\u201354, the \u2018bare bones\u2019 cost of maintaining a family was 22.59 taels, so the\nlabourer was only earning 53 per cent of subsistence; in other words, the welfare\nratio was 0.53. He could barely support himself, let alone a wife and children. A\nwoman spinning and weaving cotton for 200 days per annum, which Li and\nPomeranz both reckon was about the maximum possible, could earn 14.61 taels,\na bit more than a man.50 Again, this was less than the cost of maintaining a family.\nHusband and wife together, however, would have earned 26.61 taels, which was\n1.18 times the cost of maintaining a family. A family could survive on that, so long\nas nothing went wrong, but the standard of living was far behind that in London\nor Amsterdam where the labourers earned four times the cost of a \u2018bare bones\u2019\nstandard of living in the middle of the eighteenth century.\nSo far, this comparison has focused on the wage income of unskilled labourers.\nHowever, the wage regression and the twentieth-century wages summarized by\nGamble for Beijing all indicate that the ratio of skilled to unskilled wages was about\nthe same in China as in north-western Europe. While future research is needed,\nthis evidence suggests that our conclusions about comparative living standards\ncould still hold true if the comparison were broadened to include all kinds of wage\nearners.51\nVII\nOur investigation of Asian and European wages and prices shows that the situation\ndiffered somewhat from Adam Smith\u2019s impressions. Money wages were in accord\nwith his view: in China, they were certainly lower than wages in the advanced parts\nof western Europe in the eighteenth century and similar to those in the lagging\nparts of Europe. By the twentieth century, however, wages in all parts of Europe\nwere higher than in China. Contrary to Smith, the cost of living was similar in\nChina and in Europe in the eighteenth century.\nThe upshot of the wage and price comparisons is that living standards were low\nin China. In the eighteenth century, advanced cities like London and Amsterdam\nhad a higher standard of living than Suzhou, Beijing, or Canton. The standard of\nliving in the Chinese cities we have studied was on a par with the lagging parts of\nEurope, the Ottoman Empire, India, and Japan. By the twentieth century, enough\nprogress had occurred in even the backward parts of Europe that their standards of\nliving were beginning to creep above those in China.Wages seemed to have slipped\nin China in the eighteenth century. Still, most of the difference between Europe and\nChina in 1913 was due to European advance rather than Chinese decline.\nIn spite of the above, a major surprise is our finding that unskilled labourers in\nmajor cities of China and Japan\u2014poor as they were\u2014had roughly the same\nstandard of living as their counterparts in central and southern Europe for the\n50 Li, Agricultural development, pp. 149, 152.

This calls into question the fundamental\ntenet of the large \u2018rise of the west\u2019 literature that sees western Europe\u2014as a\nwhole\u2014surpassing the rest of the world in the early modern era. Our article\nsuggests that it was only England and the Low Countries that pulled ahead\nof the rest. The rest, in this context, includes not only Asia but also much of\nEurope.52\nIn this regard, Adam Smith neglected regional variation and thereby over-\ngeneralized the comparison of Europe and China. But our findings also dispute the\nrevisionists\u2019 claim that the advanced parts of China, such as theYangzi Delta, were\non a par with England on the eve of the industrial revolution, for we find real wages\nfor unskilled labourers in the Yangzi Delta to have been no higher than those in\nBeijing or Canton. Clearly, our database on China could be greatly improved and\nwe do not claim to have given the final answer to this question. Nevertheless, any\nnewly discovered data would have to be very different from what is currently\navailable in order to convince us that pre-industrial Chinese living standards were\nsimilar to those in the leading regions of Europe.53 In this regard, Adam Smith\u2019s\npessimism looks closer to the truth than the revisionists\u2019 optimism. Of course,\nestablishing the existence of an income gap between north-western Europe and\nChina in the early modern era only takes us halfway towards the resolution of the\ngreat divergence debate. The search for a causal explanation of the great diver-\ngence still looms large as a future research agenda.\nUniversity of Oxford; University of Montpellier; London School of Economics; Bochum\nUniversity; Utrecht University\nDate submitted 4 June 2008\nRevised version submitted 15 June 2009\nAccepted 8 September 2009\nDOI: 10.1111\/j.1468-0289.2010.00515.x\nFootnote references\nAllen, R.

Huang\u2019s comparative regional study, Peasant family, also makes a strong case that the\nYangzi Delta overall had higher productivity levels and income than north China. Our findings of roughly\ncomparable nominal and real wage levels in the three major Chinese urban centres do not necessarily preclude\nthe possibility that broader measures of per capita income and living standards could still be higher in theYangzi\nDelta. A recent study by Ma, \u2018Economic growth\u2019, shows that the per capita income of the two provinces in the\nYangzi Delta in the 1930s were 55% higher than the Chinese national average.There is good reason to believe the\nregional income gap in China in the 1930s would have been larger than in the eighteenth century. While future\nempirical research is needed to construct a comprehensive regional wage profile for eighteenth- and nineteenth-\ncentury China, the magnitude of regional variation within China as discussed in these other studies pales in\ncomparison with the gaps in average real wages in urban centres between China and England.\nLIVING STANDARDS IN CHINA 31\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.

Cotton calenderers\u2019 wages\nIn the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, most calenderers in Suzhou were migrant\nworkers from impoverished regions in Northern Jiangsu or Anhui. They usually worked\nunder a contract system, renting capital and place of work from cotton cloth merchants.\nAlthough forbidden by the government to form their own guilds, they often went on strike\nfor higher wages, hence the documentation of these negotiated wage rates in the stele\nrecords.\nInformation on the daily productivity quoted in Xu\u2019s study can be applied for converting\nthe piece rates into daily wages. According to Xu, a calenderer could press one bolt of cloth\nLIVING STANDARDS IN CHINA 33\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors. The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nin about 40 minutes.54 In a day of about 11 working hours, he could press about 12 bolts\nof cloth. For conversion, we use 11 bolts of cloth pressed per day to adjust it roughly to a\n10-hour working day. However, the calenderers would have to hand in 20 per cent as\npayment for rental and other expenses. Deducting the 20 per cent from the final wage, we\nconverted the piece wage of 0.0113 taels (in 1730) and 0.013 taels (in 1772 and 1795) per\nbolt of cloth into 0.0994 and 0.1144 taels per day respectively.The daily productivity data\nin Xu\u2019s study are based on suburban Shanghai in the early twentieth century, but Xu\nexplicitly states that both technology and organization then had changed little from the\nearly modern period.55\nB. Gamble\u2019s nineteenth-century wage series\nThe wage series in Gamble\u2019s \u2018Daily wages\u2019, which spans almost the entire nineteenth\ncentury, was derived from detailed account books of a fuel store in rural Beijing. Gamble\npresented three series of average wages for the months of May to August, April to\nSeptember, and January to December respectively.56 His careful study reveals the highly\nseasonal nature of the annual wage patterns which corresponds with the agricultural\nharvest season.We chose the annual average wage series (January to December), which is\nthe lowest of the three, as it includes the rates for the slack winter period.This wage series\nin copper cash is shown in the first column of appendix table 1 below.\nThe original wage series are all quoted in copper cash. Since Gamble was mainly\ninterested in constructing wage indices, he presented nominal and copper wage indices in\ntable 6 of his article without explicitly giving the copper\u2013silver conversion rates.57 More-\nover, due to a major debasement around 1860 and a corresponding change of monetary\naccount in the fuel store account books, Gamble broke his silver and copper wage indices\nat 1860, setting 1845 as a base 100 for the pre- and post-1860 periods respectively.Thus,\nit is possible to derive the index\u2014not the actual rate\u2014of copper\u2013silver exchange from his\ncopper and silver wage indices.\nGamble did mention the actual silver\u2013copper conversion rates in numbers of tiao (strings\nof copper cash) per silver tael for selected years of 1807, 1827, 1862, 1884, and so on.58\nOur procedure for arriving at a consistent series of copper\u2013silver exchange rates for the\nnineteenth century is to combine these benchmark rates with the derived copper\u2013silver\nexchange indices.\nHowever, interpreting the value of one tiao, which usually contained 1,000 copper\ncoins but could vary by region, is a major hurdle. Gamble remarked that one tiao in\nrural Beijing was equal to 500 copper cash before 1860 and 100 copper cash after\n1860.59 In other words, the copper cash before 1860 circulated in that locality was only\nhalf of the value of the official cash. This seems to be corroborated by Yan et al.\u2019s study\nof prices and exchange rates.60 They derived the exchange rate series (1807\u201350) from the\naccount books of a merchant store located in Daliu zhen of Ningjin County in Hebei\nprovince, about 300 kilometres from Beijing. In a footnote to their exchange rate table,\nthe authors pointed out that the value of two copper cash was counted as one.61 A\ncomparison of their copper\u2013silver exchange series and our implicit Gamble series shows\nthat their trends are nearly identical.\n54 Xu, ed., Jiangnan tubu shi, p. 378.\n55 Ibid., p. 375.\n56 Gamble, \u2018Daily wages, p. 61.\n57 Ibid., p. 60.\n58 Ibid., pp. 44, 69.\n59 Ibid., p. 44.\n60 Yan et al., eds., Zhongguo jindai jingjishi, p. 428.\n61 Ibid., tab. 31, p. 38.\n34 ALLEN, BASSINO, MA, MOLL-MURATA, AND VAN ZANDEN\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors. The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nDespite their footnote,Yan et al. derived their copper\u2013silver series based on the standard\nrate of one tiao being equal to 1,000 cash. Our copper\u2013silver exchange rate series in the\nsecond column is similarly derived, with the standard of one tiao equal to 1,000 cash. In\norder to derive the accurate wage rate in silver tael, the third column of table A1 is the silver\nwage converted from the first two volumes further divided by two. The wage rate thus\nderived seems extraordinarily low.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nAPPENDIX II: NOTES ON THE SOURCES FOR CHINESE PRICES\nOur series of prices for Beijing begins with Meng and Gamble\u2019s study of wages and\nprices in Beijing between 1900 and 1924.63 For that period they collected the retail\nprices of most elements of the basket detailed in table 4. We abstracted the\nfollowing series: wheat flour, lao mi (old, blackened rice), bean flour, millet, corn\nflour, pork, sweet oil, peanut oil, foreign cloth, and coal balls. \u2018Sweet oil\u2019 was\ntreated as \u2018edible oil\u2019 in our scheme and \u2018peanut oil\u2019 as \u2018lamp oil\u2019. Coal balls were\ntwo-thirds coal dust and one-third earth, and the price was converted to an energy\nbasis by rating one kilogram of coal balls at two-thirds of the energy content of\ncoal, which was itself rated at 27,533 BTU per kilogram.\nTo estimate the price of soybeans for 1900\u20138, we increased the wholesale price\nper kilogram of black beans by 50 per cent to allow for trade mark-ups and quality\ndifferences. The wholesale price was derived from Li, \u2018Grain prices\u2019.64 For 1909\nonwards, when the Li series ends, the 1908 price was extrapolated on the basis of\nMeng and Gamble\u2019s price series for bean flour.65\nSince no information on the price of candles was available, we assumed their\nprice per kilogram to be the same as that of one litre of lamp oil. Based on\nEuropean precedents, we estimated the price of soap at half of the price of lamp\noil.\nThe next problem was to extend these series back to the pre-industrial period.\nIt should be noted that in several important respects Meng and Gamble\u2019s data\nwere ideal: they were retail prices of goods that consumers actually bought. In\ncontrast, many historical price series are wholesale prices of intermediate goods.\nFor instance, Meng and Gamble recorded the price of wheat flour in a shop, while\nhistorians must usually make do with the price of unprocessed wheat in wholesale\nmarkets.\nTaking advantage of these ideal features of Meng and Gamble\u2019s data, we applied\nLi\u2019s study of wholesale grain prices in Zhili province, which includes Beijing. From\nthe graphs in her paper, we could read off the prices of wheat, millet, and sorghum\nfrom 1738 to 1908, as well as the relative price of black beans to wheat.These are\nfive-year moving averages, so annual fluctuations are suppressed, but that is of little\nconsequence for the present study.66 On the basis of these series, the retail prices\nof wheat flour, millet, corn flour, bean flour, and soybeans were extrapolated back\nto 1738. The resulting extrapolated series are linked using the average of 1901\u20134\nas the base period. This procedure assumes that the ratio of the retail price of the\nconsumer good to the wholesale price of the unprocessed good remained constant.\nThe retail prices of other products were extrapolated back to 1738 as follows: for\nmeat, edible oil, lamp oil, and candles, the price of wheat flour was applied, based\non the benchmark period of 1901\u20134 for meat (the average price of pork and\nmutton), and 1902 for the rest. For corn flour, the price of sorghum based on the\n1901\u20134 benchmark was used, and for rice (lao mi, old or blackened rice), the price\nof rice in the Yangzi Delta, based on the 1901\u20134 benchmark.67\n63 Meng and Gamble, \u2018Wages, prices, and the standard of living\u2019, pp. 28, 38\u20139, 51, 59.\n64 Li, \u2018Grain prices\u2019, pp. 69\u2013100.\n65 Meng and Gamble, Prices, p. 28.\n66 Professor L.

The Economic History Review published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Economic History Society Economic History\nReview, 64, S1 (2011)\nTwo things can be said in favour of these extrapolations. First, most of the\nlong-term agricultural time series inflate at the same rate, so the values projected\nback into the eighteenth century do not depend critically on which price series is\nused for the extrapolation. Second, the extrapolations can be checked by compar-\ning the values we obtain in the eighteenth century for prices listed in the VOC\nrecords for Canton. Since the extrapolated prices are similar to prices paid then,\nthis gives us some confidence in the procedure.\nThe price series of cotton cloth is based on several sources. First, the Beijing\nretail price of foreign cloth was projected back to 1871 using Feuerwerker\u2019s series\nof the price of cotton cloth imported into China.68 Imported cloth was measured\nin pieces which were usually 40 yards long by one yard wide (360 square feet).\nMeng and Gamble\u2019s price was the price per 100 feet. We interpret that to mean\n100 linear feet from a bolt of cloth, which we assume was three feet wide\u2014a typical\nwidth. On those assumptions, the retail price per square foot of foreign cloth in\nBeijing was about 50 per cent more than the price at which it was landed. This is\nnot an unreasonable mark-up.\nIn his detailed discussion of eighteenth-century cloth prices and weaving\nincomes, Pomeranz estimated the price of cloth in a low price scenario at 0.5 taels\nper bolt.69 On this assumption, 300 square feet of cloth were worth 4.59 taels, and\nwe interpret this as the eighteenth-century counterpart to Meng and Gamble\u2019s\nprice for a 100-foot length of a piece of cloth three feet wide. Following Pomeranz,\nwe assume that cloth prices remained constant over the eighteenth century.70\nFor the years between 1800 and 1870, we were guided by the history of cloth\nprices in Indonesia. A series of the price paid for cotton cloth in Java from 1815 to\n1871 shows that from 1815 to 1824, the price was 4.89 grams of silver per square\nmetre, which compares to a Chinese price of 5.12 grams per square metre for the\neighteenth century. This correspondence is reassuring since cotton cloth was\ntraded across Asia, so we would not expect extreme differences in its price. Starting\nin the 1830s, the price in Java dropped fairly quickly to a value of about 2.5 grams\nof silver per square metre and stayed at that level until 1871.71 That low price is\nsimilar to the value of cloth imported into China\u20142.36 grams of silver per square\nmetre in 1871. On the assumption that cloth prices in China followed the same\ntemporal pattern as those in Java, the eighteenth-century price derived from\nPomeranz was continued to 1830, and then interpolated linearly between 1830\nand 1871.\nThe price of energy was also combined from diverse sources. For 1739\u201369, we\nused the data implied by charcoal prices in Zhili province in the 1769 Wuliao jiazhi\nzeli, and for 1816, the price implied by the price of coal in Beijing given by\nTimkovski.72 From 1900 onwards, the cost of energy was based on the price of coal\nballs. One of the striking features of this scattered information is that it gives a\nfairly constant price for energy. In view of that constancy, the values for the missing\nyears were interpolated.\n68 Feuerwerker, \u2018Handicraft\u2019, p. 344.\n69 Pomeranz, Great divergence, p. 319, decided that a cloth of 16 chi in length cost 0.4 taels. According to\nLi, Agricultural development, p. xvii, a bolt of 20 chi had 3.63 square yards. Hence, the price of cloth was 0.5 taels\nper bolt.\n70 Pomeranz, Great divergence, p. 323.\n71 See Korthals Altes, \u2018Prices\u2019, for cloth prices in Java.\n72 Timkovski, Voyage, p. 200.\nLIVING STANDARDS IN CHINA 37\n\u00a9 2010 The Authors.
