This paper assesses evidence from field 3 \nexperiments for N deposition effects and thresholds for terrestrial plant diversity protection 4 \nacross a latitudinal range of main categories of ecosystems, from Arctic and boreal systems to 5 \ntropical forests. Current thinking on the mechanisms of N deposition effects on plant diversity, 6 \nthe global distribution of G200 ecoregions, and current and future (2030) estimates of 7 \natmospheric N deposition rate are then used to identify the risks to plant diversity in all major 8 \necosystem types now and in the future. 9 \n 10 \nThis synthesis paper clearly shows that N accumulation is the main driver of changes to species 11 \ncomposition across the whole range of different ecosystem types by driving the competitive 12 \ninteractions that lead to composition change and\/or making conditions unfavorable for soem 13 \nspecies. Other effects such as direct toxicity of nitrogen gases and aerosols, long-term negative 14 \neffects of increased ammonium and ammonia availability, soil mediated effects of acidification 15 \nand secondary stress and disturbance are more ecosystem and site specific and often play a 16 \nsupporting role. N deposition effects in Mediterranean ecosystems have now been identified, 17 \nleading to a first estimate of an effect threshold. Importantly, ecosystems thought of as not N 18 \nlimited, such as tropical and sub-tropical systems, may be more vulnerable in the regeneration 19 \nphase, in situations where heterogeneity in N availability is reduced by atmospheric N 20 \ndeposition, on sandy soils or in the montane areas.   21 \n 22 \nCritical loads are effect thresholds for N deposition and the critical approach concept has 23 \nhelped European Governments make progress towards reducing N loads on sensitive 24 \necosystems. More needs to be done in Europe and North America especially for the more 25 \nsensitive ecosystems types, including several ecosystems of high conservational importance.  26 \nBobbink et al. \n 4\nThe results of this assessment show that the vulnerable regions outside Europe and N America, 1 \nwhich have not received enough attention, are ecoregions in eastern and southern Asia (China, 2 \nIndia), an important part of the Mediterranean ecoregion (California, southern Europe) and in 3 \nthe coming decades several subtropical and tropical parts of Latin America and Africa. 4 \nReductions in plant diversity by increased atmospheric N deposition may be more widespread 5 \nthan first thought and more targeted studies are required in low background areas, especially in 6 \nthe G200 ecoregions.  7 \n 8 \nKey words: Nitrogen deposition, species richness, diversity, critical loads, terrestrial, 9 \nArctic-alpine, boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, tropical, ecoregions. 10 \n11 \nBobbink et al. \n 5\n1. Introduction 1 \n 2 \nNitrogen (N) is an essential plant nutrient and many terrestrial ecosystems are adapted to 3 \nconditions of low N availability, a situation that often leads to plant communities with high 4 \nspecies diversity (Bobbink et al. 1998). At the global scale, current N emission scenarios 5 \nproject most regions having increased rates of atmospheric N deposition in 2030 (Dentener et 6 \nal. 2006) which is causing concern about significant impacts on global plant biodiversity 7 \n(Vitousek et al. 1997, Sala et al. 2000, Phoenix et al. 2006).  8 \nThe N cycling in ecosystems is originally derived from three main sources: biological N 9 \nfixation (BNF), mineralization and atmospheric deposition. The first represents the 10 \nintroduction of new reactive N (Nr) into the system, the second is conversion of organic Nr to 11 \ninorganic Nr within the system, and the third is the transfer of Nr from one system to another.  12 \nThe term reactive N (Nr) as used in this paper includes all biologically active, chemically 13 \nreactive, and radiatively active N compounds in the atmosphere and biosphere of the Earth. 14 \nThus Nr includes inorganic reduced forms of N (e.g. NH3, NH4+), inorganic oxidized forms 15 \n(e.g. NOx, HNO3, N2O, NO3-), and organic compounds (e.g., urea, amines, proteins), in 16 \ncontrast to unreactive N2 gas. In the natural world before the agricultural and industrial 17 \nrevolutions, atmospheric deposition was a relatively unimportant source.  In the current world, 18 \natmospheric deposition is not only an important source, but it can also be the dominant source 19 \n(Galloway et al. 2008).  The major factor that drives the changes in the global N cycle is the 20 \nincreased Nr creation rate due to human demands for food and energy.  Anthropogenic Nr can 21 \nbe emitted to the atmosphere as NOx, NH3 and organic N (Dentener et al. 2006, Neff et al. 22 \n2002, Galloway et al. 2004).  Major NOx sources are combustion of fossil fuels and biomass; 23 \nmajor NH3 sources are emissions from fertilizer and manure; major organic N sources are more 24 \nuncertain but include both natural and anthropogenic sources. In a world without humans, 25 \nterrestrial Nr creation was entirely by natural processes (BNF and lightning).  By 1860, natural 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 6\nprocesses still dominated (~120 Tg N yr-1) because anthropogenic processes were still small 1 \n(~16 Tg N yr-1), almost entirely from cultivation-induced BNF (Galloway et al. 2004). By 2 \n2005, natural processes had diminished due to land use change, and anthropogenic processes 3 \nhad increased by over an order of magnitude to ~210 Tg N yr-1 (Galloway et al. 2008).   4 \nWith the exception of N2O, all of the Nr emitted to the atmosphere is deposited to the Earth\u2019s 5 \nsurface following transport through the atmosphere.  Atmospheric N transport ranges in scale 6 \nfrom tens to thousands of kilometers. The subsequent deposition often represents the 7 \nintroduction of biologically active N to N-limited ecosystems (both terrestrial and marine) that 8 \nhave no internal sources of anthropogenic N (Phoenix et al. 2006, Duce et al. 2008).  This sets 9 \nthat stage for multiple impacts on the biodiversity of the receiving ecosystems. 10 \n 11 \nWith the increase in N deposition over the last 50 years, plant communities in wide parts of 12 \nEurope and North America may have shifted towards compositions typical of high(er) N 13 \navailability (e.g. Bobbink et al. 1998). This shift has often been associated with changes and 14 \nloss in diversity of plant species and associations, particularly in regions with high N 15 \ndeposition. International concern over these impacts led to the development of effect thresholds 16 \n(or critical loads) for N deposition (Nilsson and Grennfelt 1988, Hettelingh et al. 2001, UBA 17 \n2004). Research over the last 2\/3 decades in Europe and North America, that has also fed into 18 \nthe development of critical loads, has shown that the severity of the effects of air-borne N 19 \ndeposition depends on: (1) the duration, the total amount and the N form of the inputs, (2) the 20 \nintrinsic sensitivity of the (plant) species present and (3) the abiotic conditions in the 21 \necosystem. Acid neutralising capacity (ANC), soil nutrient availability, and other soil factors, 22 \nwhich influence the nitrification potential and N immobilisation rate are of particular 23 \nimportance. The last two items (2 & 3) can be influenced by both past and present land use and 24 \nby management. As a consequence, high variation in sensitivity to N deposition has been 25 \nBobbink et al. \n 7\nobserved between different ecosystems. Despite this diverse sequence of events, the following 1 \nmain effects \u201cmechanisms\u201d can be recognised  (Fig. 1): 2 \n(a) Direct toxicity of nitrogen gases and aerosols to individual species (e.g. Pearson & 3 \nStewart 1993). High air concentrations have an adverse effect on the above-ground 4 \nplant parts (physiology, growth) of individual plants. Such effects are only important at 5 \nhigh air concentrations near large point sources; 6 \n(b) Accumulation of N compounds, resulting in higher N availabilities and changes of plant 7 \nspecies interactions (e.g. Bobbink et al. 1998). This ultimately leads to changes in 8 \nspecies composition, plant diversity and N cycling. This effect chain can be highly 9 \ninfluenced by other soil factors, such as P limitation;  10 \n(c) Long-term negative effect of reduced N (ammonia and ammonium) (e.g. Roelofs et al. 11 \n1996; Kleijn et al. 2008). Increased ammonium availability can be toxic to sensitive 12 \nplant species, especially in habitats with nitrate as the dominant N form and originally 13 \nhardly any ammonium. It causes very poor root and shoot development, especially in 14 \nsensitive species from weakly buffered habitats (pH 4.5 - 6.5); 15 \n(d) Soil-mediated effects of acidification (e.g. Van Breemen et al. 1982; Ulrich 1983, 1991 16 \nDe Vries et al. 2003). This long-term process, also caused by inputs of N compounds, 17 \nleads to a lower soil pH, increased leaching of base cations, increased concentrations of 18 \npotentially toxic metals (e.g. Al3+), a decrease in nitrification and an accumulation of 19 \nlitter;  20 \n(e) Increased susceptibility to secondary stress and disturbance factors (e.g. Bobbink et al. 21 \n2003). The resistance to plant pathogens and insect pests can be lowered because of 22 \nlower vitality of the individuals as a consequence of N deposition impacts, whereas 23 \nincreased N contents of plants can also result in increased herbivory. Furthermore, N-24 \nrelated changes in plant physiology, biomass allocation (root\/shoot ratios) and 25 \nBobbink et al. \n 8\nmycorrhizal infection can also influence the susceptibility of plant species to drought or 1 \nfrost. 2 \n 3 \nIn general, the potential risk of global impacts of N enrichment on biodiversity have been 4 \nrecognised (e.g. Sala et al. 2000; Phoenix et al. 2006), but there has been no attempt to compile 5 \nthe evidence across major global biomes of the effects of N deposition on plant diversity. The 6 \nkey aim of this paper is to provide such a synthesis.  7 \nThis paper aims to: 8 \na. describe the effect chains of N which affect plant diversity of major ecosystem types 9 \naround the globe, going from high to low latitudes (Arctic \u2013 boreal \u2013 temperate \u2013 10 \nMediterranean and arid zones\u2013 subtropical and tropical systems), focusing on 11 \nquantitative dose effect studies (section 2); 12 \nb. review the main mechanisms for impacts of N deposition on plant diversity from the 13 \navailable experimental evidence (section 3);  14 \nc. summarize the use and limitations of critical load approaches for N deposition applied 15 \nin Europe and prospects for their application in other parts of the world  (section 4).  16 \nd. highlight the (increasing) atmospheric deposition of N across the globe and identify the 17 \nareas and ecosystems around the globe now and in the future that are receiving or likely 18 \nto receive enhanced N loads (section 5). 19 \nFinally, the available information is synthesized in an assessment of the prospects for further 20 \nplant diversity loss in the concluding remarks (section 6). 21 \n 22 \n 23 \n2. Effects of N deposition on plant diversity in ecosystem types around the globe: an 24 \noverview  25 \n 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 9\nIn this section we systematically describe the effects of N deposition on plant diversity in eight 1 \nmajor global ecosystem types, focusing on vascular plants. Whenever available, we also 2 \ndescribe effects on bryophytes, lichens, mosses and epiphytic species as these tend to be the 3 \nmore sensitive elements of ecosystems to N impacts. First an overview is given of the 4 \ncharacteristics of each ecosystem, sometimes including a general overview of potential N 5 \ndeposition impacts. We then include an overview of N effects, mainly based on N addition 6 \nexperiments and sometimes also including circumstantial field evidence. The important data of 7 \nthe included studies are given in a summarizing table (see Technical Annexe 1), except for the 8 \nwell-known data for European temperate systems (see Bobbink et al. 2003 for details). Each 9 \nsubsection concludes by presenting a threshold for N deposition damage whenever possible. 10 \n 11 \n2.1 Arctic and Alpine ecosystems 12 \nCharacteristics 13 \nPlant habitats in arctic and alpine ecosystems include tundra (including polar deserts), arctic 14 \nand (sub) alpine scrubs and (sub) alpine grasslands. Plant growth in all these habitats is 15 \nrestricted by short growing seasons, cold temperatures, frequent and strong winds and low 16 \nnutrient supply. The distribution of plant communities in the landscape is dependent on the 17 \ndistribution of snow during winter and spring. Most alpine and all arctic soils are influenced by 18 \nfrost activity or solifluction. Current loads of atmospheric N deposition to arctic ecosystems are 19 \nvery low (< 2-3 kg N ha-1 yr-1). N deposition to (sub) alpine ecosystems in central Europe is 20 \nsometimes considerable higher (10 \u2013 20 kg N ha-1 yr-1). 21 \n 22 \nEffects on tundra  23 \nThe key feature which distinguishes tundra is the presence of permafrost, which prevents root 24 \npenetration and often keeps the ground waterlogged in summer. There have been several field 25 \nmanipulation studies with nutrients in tundra ecosystems; however, most have involved NPK 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 10\nfertilizer additions (e.g. Robinson et al. 1998, Press et al. 1998, Schmidt et al. 2000) or single 1 \nlarge applications of N (e.g. Henry et al. 1986, Shaver and Chapin 1995), which makes it 2 \ndifficult to use the results for making predictions of plant community responses to annual low 3 \nN additions. The few available studies with annual N additions to tundra ecosystems have 4 \ndemonstrated increased cover of vascular plants and decreased cover of bryophytes and lichens 5 \n(Baddeley et al. 1994, Gordon et al. 2001, Nilsson et al. 2002, Soudzilovskaia and Onipchenko 6 \n2005, Soudzilovskaia et al. 2005).  For polar deserts with large areas of bare ground, Madan et 7 \nal. (2007) demonstrated that N addition (50 and 5 kg N ha-1 yr-1) in combination with P 8 \naddition, strongly increased vascular plant cover. From sole N addition the effects were less 9 \npronounced, but still detectable. For tundra habitats and for polar deserts it has been 10 \ndemonstrated that P availability often restricts the responses to N, i.e. plant growth is co-11 \nlimited by N and P (Gordon et al. 2001, Soudzilovskaia et al. 2005, Madan et al. 2007). 12 \n 13 \nEffects on alpine and subalpine scrub habitats (\u201cheaths\u201d) 14 \nAlso in scrub habitats it has been demonstrated that bottom-layer bryophytes and lichens are 15 \nsensitive to annual N additions. N addition (10 and 40  kg ha-1 yr-1) to a Racomitrium 16 \nlanuginosum-Carex bigelowii heath in the Scottish highlands demonstrated that R. 17 \nlanuginosum cover was reduced by as much as 31 % by the low N addition, while graminoid 18 \ncover increased by 57% (Pearce and Van der Wal 2002). Also for other alpine heath 19 \necosystems in Scotland and Norway it has been found that lichens are the functional type most 20 \nsensitive to N addition, while vascular plants do not show much response (Fremstad et al. 21 \n2005, Britton and Fisher 2007). 22 \n  23 \nEffects on alpine grasslands 24 \nAlpine grasslands are well known for their high diversity of vascular plant species. It has been 25 \ndemonstrated that N addition (20, 40 and 60 kg N ha-1 yr-1) to an alpine grassland in Colorado 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 11\ndid not significantly change species richness of the vegetation although it increased the 1 \nShannon index of diversity (Bowman et al. 2006). The study showed that sedges benefited 2 \nmore from N addition than grasses and forbs and that the species unresponsive to N did not 3 \ndecline, but maintained their productivity (Bowman et al. 2006).  In the European Alps N 4 \naddition (>10 kg N ha-1 yr-1) increased total plant biomass, particularly the biomass of sedges 5 \n(Bassin et al. 2007). K\u00f6rner (2003) suggested that for alpine grasslands the unlimited supply of 6 \nlight allows N favored species to increase their productivity, without a concomitant decrease of 7 \nspecies not favoured by N additions. 8 \n 9 \nThresholds for nitrogen deposition impacts 10 \nIn conclusion, for arctic and alpine ecosystems it appears that lichens and bryophytes are the 11 \nmost sensitive species to increased N inputs. Several studies report lichen and bryophyte 12 \ndecline. Very few experiments have added N doses smaller than 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1, but at this 13 \nlevel of N input significant plant biomass increase have been reported from grassland 14 \necosystems. Studies in the harshest habitats (polar deserts and arctic heaths) have demonstrated 15 \nthat plant growth is co-limited by N and P. The evidence leads to an effect threshold for 16 \nnitrogen deposition between 5 \u2013 15 kg N ha-1 yr-1, depending of the studied ecosystem. 17 \n 18 \n2.2 Boreal forest  19 \nCharacteristics 20 \nBoreal forests are the largest forest zone of the global vegetation types. Plant growth in boreal 21 \necosystems is restricted by short growing seasons, cold temperatures, and low nutrient supply. 22 \nCurrent loads of N deposition to boreal regions in northern Europe are relatively low (generally 23 \n< 6 kg N ha-1 yr-1). There is evidence that even this relatively low N deposition rate has the 24 \npotential to change plant species composition, diversity and ecosystem functioning. 25 \n 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 12\nIn many boreal ecosystems, bryophytes constitute an important bottom-layer component. 1 \nBryophytes efficiently retain N added by wet and dry deposition and are therefore considered 2 \nto be highly sensitive to airborne N pollutants (Lamers et al. 2000, Turetsky 2003). Bryophyte 3 \nresponses to N addition are species specific and in boreal forests dominant species, like 4 \nHylocomium splendens, start to decline at N input rates of > 10 kg kg N  ha-1 yr-1 (Hallingb\u00e4ck 5 \n1992, M\u00e4kip\u00e4\u00e4 1995, M\u00e4kip\u00e4\u00e4 and Heikkinen 2003), while species normally inhabiting more 6 \nnutrient-rich habitats, like Brachythecium spp. and Plagiothecium spp., increase (Strengbom et 7 \nal. 2001). For vascular plant species, N addition results in proliferation of relatively fast-8 \ngrowing graminoids, sedges and herbs at the expense of the more slow growing dwarf-shrubs 9 \n(Strengbom et al. 2002, Nordin et al. 2005). Bobbink (2004) demonstrated that N addition to 10 \nboreal forest does not influence species richness, but causes drastic shifts in species 11 \ncomposition of the understorey vegetation.  12 \n 13 \nStudies of N effects on boreal ecosystem function have revealed several mechanisms mediating 14 \nN induced vegetation change. For example, in boreal spruce forest, damage to the dominant 15 \nunderstorey dwarf-shrub Vaccinium myrtillus from pathogens increased in response to 16 \nexperimental N additions (Nordin et al. 1998, Strengbom et al. 2002, Nordin et al. 2006). A 17 \nsimilar pattern existed under a natural gradient of N deposition as pathogen damage to the 18 \nshrub became more frequent in areas where N deposition exceeded ca. 6 kg N ha-1 yr-1 19 \n(Strengbom et al. 2003). Pathogen damage to V. myrtillus occurs in well-defined patches of the 20 \nshrub canopy. In such patches the shrubs become leaf-less early in the growing-season and 21 \nmore fast-growing competing plants (mainly the graminoid Deschampsia flexuosa) proliferate 22 \nfrom the increased N supply in combination with the increased light availability (Strengbom et 23 \nal. 2002, Strengbom et al. 2004).  24 \n 25 \nBobbink et al. \n 13\nThe relative supply of reduced and oxidized N is another factor with potential to influence 1 \nplant species distribution. In boreal soils slow N mineralization rates result in the dissolved N 2 \npool directly available for plant uptake being dominated by organic N forms (like amino acids) 3 \nand\/or NH4+ while NO3- hardly occurs (Nordin et al. 2001, 2004, Jones and Kielland 2002). 4 \nAirborne N deposited over these ecosystems consists of more or less equal portions of NH4+ 5 \nand NO3-, and in coastal areas NO3- can even be the dominant N form. Various boreal tree 6 \nspecies, as well as many dwarf-shrubs and herbs, have only limited capacity to utilize NO3-  7 \n(Chapin et al. 1993, Kronzucker et al. 1997, Nordin et al. 2001, 2004). In contrast, plant 8 \nspecies adapted to N-rich habitats, often exhibit high capacities to take up NO3-, but only 9 \nlimited capacity to take up organic N (Bowman and Steltzer 1998, Nordin et al. 2001, 2006). 10 \nAlthough many effects of N deposition to ecosystems can be related to the quantity of N 11 \ndeposited, it seems important to recognize that also the chemical form of the deposited N may 12 \ninfluence the ecosystem response to N deposition. 13 \n 14 \nThresholds for nitrogen deposition impacts 15 \nWe concluded that increased N inputs can considerably affect the understorey vegetation of 16 \nboreal forests. Long-term N fertilization experiments clearly showed changes in species 17 \ncomposition, but no decline in overall species richness. Changes in biotic interactions 18 \n(increased pathogen damage to plants) have been observed at N deposition rates of 6 kg N ha-1 19 \nyr-1. It is clear that bryophyte, lichen and dwarf-shrub species all are sensitive to increased N 20 \ninputs, leading to an effect threshold of 5-10 kg N ha-1 yr-1, although the ratio of NO3 to NH4 in 21 \ndeposition may change the threshold and nature of effects.  22 \n 23 \n2.3 Temperate forests  24 \nCharacteristics  25 \nBobbink et al. \n 14\nInputs of atmospheric N to woodlands often exceed that to low vegetation from the filtering 1 \neffect of the canopy. Tall, aerodynamically rough surfaces efficiently capture pollutant gases, 2 \naerosols, and cloud droplets containing Nr compounds. Increased N inputs of 16 \u2013 48% 3 \n(Fowler et al. 1999) can be further enhanced in high altitude forests from orographic effects 4 \n(Dore et al. 1992). Gilliam and Adams (1996) found wet N deposition to be 50% higher at 750 5 \nm than at 500 m in eastern US hardwood forests.  Thus, high altitude forests are at particular 6 \nrisk from the impacts of N deposition. This section focuses on evidence of N effects on species 7 \ndiversity and composition of herbaceous (field) layer and epiphytic communities based on 8 \nevidence from field experiments and surveys. Recent reviews on this can be found in Gilliam 9 \n(2006, 2007), De Vries et al. (2007), Bobbink et al. (2003), and Emmett (2007).  10 \n 11 \nExperimental Evidence of Effects on the Herbaceous Layer 12 \nThe most diverse vegetation stratum of temperate forests is the herbaceous layer (Gilliam 13 \n2007). Excess N can decrease forest biodiversity by reducing herb layer richness (Bobbink et 14 \nal. 1998, Gilliam and Roberts 2003).  Gilliam (2006) identified general patterns of this 15 \nresponse: initial increases in cover, decreases in richness from loss of N-efficient species, 16 \ndecreases in species evenness from increasing dominance of few nitrophilic species, and loss of 17 \nbiodiversity from decreases in richness and evenness.  Gilliam (2006) developed a conceptual 18 \nmodel to explain this decline: (1) alteration of inter-specific competition giving a competitive 19 \nadvantage to nitrophilic species (Price and Morgan 2007), (2) increased herbivory on sensitive 20 \nspecies by increasing foliar quality and decreasing secondary defence compounds (Throop & 21 \nLerdau 2004), (3) decreased frequency of mycorrhizal infection (decreasing survivorship of 22 \nmycorrhizae-dependent species) (Lilleskov & Bruns 2001, Read & Perez-Moreno 2003), (4) 23 \nincreased disease (Mitchell et al. 2003), and (5) increased invasive species (Luken 2003, 24 \nCassidy et al. 2004, Ehrenfeld 2004).  A recent hypothesis\u2014the N homogeneity hypothesis 25 \n(Gilliam 2006)\u2014predicts declines in biodiversity of impacted forests from excess N deposition 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 15\nthat decreases naturally high spatial heterogeneity in soil N availability (Hutchings et al. 2003, 1 \nSmall & McCarthy 2003) that maintains high species diversity of the herbaceous layer. 2 \n 3 \nSeveral US studies have examined the response of the herbaceous layer to experimental 4 \nadditions of N to determine effects of N on species composition and diversity of the herb layer, 5 \nas well as effects on nutrient uptake.  Salient details of these studies are summarized in 6 \nTechnical Annexe 1. 7 \n 8 \nN has been added to an entire watershed at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF), West 9 \nVirginia, since 1989.  Foliar analysis of a common herb layer species, Viola rotundifolia, 10 \nrevealed higher N in the treatment versus control watersheds, accompanied by lower Ca and 11 \nMg, in response to 4-yr of treatment, suggesting that N additions increased N availability and 12 \ndecreased Ca2+ and Mg2+ availability to herb layer species (Gilliam & Adams, 1996). 13 \nHurd et al. (1998) added N at three hardwood sites in the Adirondack Mountains, New York, 14 \nfinding that cover of dominant herbaceous species declined significantly after three years of 15 \ntreatment, partly from increased shading by fern species.  This response was more pronounced 16 \nat the site with lower ambient inputs of atmospheric N. 17 \nThe impacts of 7-yrs N addition to the forest floor of red pine stands were studied in the 18 \nHarvard Forest, Massachusetts (Rainey et al. 1999). N concentrations in the dominant species 19 \nwere significantly higher in treatment plots, whereas cation concentrations were generally 20 \nlower, supporting the conclusions of Gilliam et al. (1996).  Density and biomass declined 80% 21 \nand ~90%, respectively, for all herb layer species; particularly notable was the dominant 22 \nspecies, Maianthemum canadense. 23 \nIn contrast to the last two studies, Gilliam et al. (2006) concluded that 6 yr of N additions to an 24 \nAppalachian hardwood forest produced no significant effects on the herb layer. Gilliam et al. 25 \n(2006) suggested that the lack of observed response was the consequence of high ambient 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 16\nlevels of N deposition (wet only, 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Schleppi et al. (1999) also reported no 1 \nsignificant change in herb layer cover or composition after 3 yr addition of 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1 to 2 \na spruce-fir forest in Switzerland, in an area with high ambient deposition. 3 \n 4 \nEvidence from national monitoring and field surveys  5 \nEvidence of species change, especially in Europe, is also available from national and regional 6 \nsurveys and monitoring programmes, but N effects are often confounded with other 7 \ndisturbances. Kirby et al. (2005) found decreases in species richness in British woodlands from 8 \n1971-2001 (excluding storm-damaged sites) and increases in cover of some nitrophilous 9 \nspecies, but also identified other factors (e.g. canopy growth, management methods, climate 10 \nchange) also impacting ground flora. 11 \n 12 \nRecent increases in nitrophilic species in forest herb layers from increased rates of N 13 \ndeposition have been recorded throughout Europe (Bobbink et al. 2003). These include studies 14 \nshowing more nitrophilous species in Dutch forests with deposition > 40 kg ha-1 yr-1 (Dirkse & 15 \nvan Dobben 1989), increases in nitrophilous species in German fir\/spruce and Scots pine forest 16 \nwith deposition of 15-30 kg ha-1 yr-1 (Kraft et al. 2000), decreased frequency of many species 17 \nand increased frequency of nitrophilous species in the central plateau of Switzerland with 18 \ndeposition of 30-40 kg ha-1 yr-1 (Walther & Grundmann 2001), and an increase in nitrophilous 19 \nspecies in deciduous forests of eastern France with deposition of 20-30 kg ha-1 yr-1 (Thimonier 20 \net al. 1992, 1994). Although other factors (e.g. management practices) may alter species 21 \ncomposition, these studies together provide strong, consistent evidence that N deposition 22 \nsignificantly impacts European temperate forests. 23 \n 24 \nGradient studies from point sources (e.g., intensive animal houses) provide clear evidence of 25 \nthe effects of atmospheric NH3 concentrations, supporting interpretations of broader-scale field 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 17\nstudies. Pitcairn et al. (1998) reported increases in nitrophilous species (Holcus lanatus, Rubus 1 \nidaeus, Urtica dioica) close to livestock units, identifying a threshold of 15-20 kg N ha-1 yr-1 2 \nfor significant species change. 3 \n 4 \nMost detailed studies of response of herb layer composition to moderate N deposition have 5 \nbeen in oak forests of southern Sweden (deposition of 7-20 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Brunet et al. (1998) 6 \nreported an increase in nitrophilous, acid-tolerant species at sites with higher levels of N 7 \ndeposition over a 10-yr period. Falken-Grerup & Diekmann (2003) identified important 8 \ninteractions with soil pH, with nitrophilous species increasing especially in the pH range 3.5-9 \n5.0 where total number of species was 20% lower at sites with higher rates of N deposition.      10 \n 11 \nEffects on epiphytic species 12 \nEpiphytes are among the more sensitive woodland species. Negative effects are often 13 \nassociated with high N concentrations in wet and dry deposition (e.g., Pearce and Van der Wal 14 \n2008). In areas of high NH3 concentrations, effects mediated through changes in bark 15 \nchemistry have increased nitrophytic species and eliminated acidophytic species.  16 \n 17 \nIn the epiphyte-rich Atlantic oakwoods of the UK, Mitchell et al. (2003) found large variation 18 \nin species composition over deposition of 10-50 kg N ha-1 yr-1.  Several sensitive species (e.g., 19 \nLobaria pulmonaria) were only found at sites with deposition rates > 20 kg N ha-1 yr-1. 20 \nTransplant experiments between areas of low and high N deposition (12 and 54 kg N ha-1 yr-1, 21 \nrespectively) demonstrated changes in species vitality and cover consistent with the field 22 \nsurveys. Effects associated with transplant to areas of reduced N deposition were slower than 23 \nthose associated with transplant to areas of increased N deposition, suggesting longer duration 24 \nfor recovery than for initial impacts of N deposition (Mitchell et al. 2004).  25 \n 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 18\nThresholds for nitrogen deposition impacts 1 \nEffects of current and future N deposition on temperate forest biodiversity are difficult to 2 \nquantify because (1) experimental N addition rates are often > 50 kg N ha-1 yr-1, (2) 3 \nbackground N deposition at sites can be high, and (3) biodiversity loss may already have 4 \noccurred. Available evidence suggests that the threshold for N deposition effects on 5 \nunderstorey biodiversity is < 20 kg ha-1 yr-1, and may be as low as 10-15 kg ha-1 yr-1 for 6 \nsensitive communities. In the Adirondack Mountains, Hurd et al. (1998) reported significant 7 \ndeclines in cover of dominant herbaceous understorey species after only 3 years of N additions 8 \nas low as 14 kg ha-1 yr-1. N deposition at Huntington Forest, the site where foliar N responses 9 \nwere greatest, was reportedly 7-10 kg ha-1 yr-1, thus giving a total N input of ca. 20 kg ha-1 yr-1 10 \nin the lowest N treatment (Hurd et al. 1998; Lovett and Lindberg 1993). Pitcairn et al. (1998) 11 \nshowed a threshold of 15-20 kg ha-1 yr-1, whereas field surveys in moderate deposition areas of 12 \nEurope suggest a threshold for changes in species composition in the range 10-15 kg ha-1 yr-1. 13 \n 14 \nAn important implication of these thresholds is that many European and North American 15 \nforests have probably already experienced significant loss of species diversity and changes in 16 \nspecies composition. Hence, as identified by Gilliam (2006), understorey communities will 17 \nrespond most rapidly to further increases in N deposition in areas with low levels of ambient 18 \ndeposition. For field layer and epiphytic communities in species-depleted areas, a key unknown 19 \nis if\/how diversity can be increased once N deposition rates decline. 20 \n 21 \n2.4 Temperate non-forest ecosystems 22 \nA considerable part of the biodiversity of the temperate zone of Europe and North America is 23 \npresent in semi-natural ecosystems. Here we restrict our discussion to two major groups, 24 \nnamely dwarf-shrub vegetation (heathlands) and species-rich grasslands. Most of these, and 25 \nother, systems of high conservation value originated under long-term low intensity agricultural 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 19\nmanagement and occur on oligotrophic to mesotrophic soil conditions. Because of this low 1 \nnutrient status, many temperate semi-natural ecosystems can be sensitive to eutrophication by 2 \nenhanced N inputs, while in weakly buffered systems, acidification can also be important. 3 \n  4 \n2.4.1 Characteristics 5 \nThe term heath is used for communities where the dominant life form is small-leaved dwarf-6 \nshrubs (mostly Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp), forming a canopy of 1 m or less above soil 7 \nsurface. Grasses and forbs may form discontinuous strata, and frequently a ground layer of 8 \nmosses or lichens is present. In sub-Atlantic parts of Europe heaths are certainly man-made, 9 \nsemi-natural ecosystems, which need management to conserve their typical diversity. 10 \nHeathlands are found on nutrient-poor mineral soils with a low pH (3.5-4.5). Despite 11 \nconservation efforts, many lowland heaths in Western Europe have become dominated by grass 12 \nspecies over the past 20-50 years.  13 \n 14 \nSemi-natural grasslands with traditional agricultural use have long been an important part of 15 \nthe landscape in temperate Europe. Natural temperate grasslands (steppe or prairie) with no 16 \nnatural tree growth because of climatic constraints are very rare in Europe but do occur in 17 \nNorth America. Semi-natural species-rich grasslands are generally nutrient-poor, with a history 18 \nof low inputs combined with nutrient removal by grazing or hay making; and hence can be 19 \naffected by increased atmospheric N inputs. Moreover, some of the most species-rich 20 \ngrasslands occur under weakly buffered or almost neutral conditions, which make them 21 \nsensitive to acidification and very sensitive to negative impacts of ammonium accumulation. 22 \n 23 \n2.4.2. Effects on heathlands 24 \nAlthough changes from traditional management practices may be partly responsible, there is a 25 \nwide range of evidence that increased N deposition has contributed to the decline of dwarf 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 20\nshrub dominated heath in Europe. However, early competition experiments in the Netherlands 1 \nshowed a significant effect of N addition on competition between C. vulgaris and grass species 2 \nonly in young heaths of low stature and cover (e.g. Heil and Bruggink 1987, Aerts et al. 1990). 3 \nSince then, a combination of mesocosm, field and modelling studies has made it clear that 4 \neffects of increased N deposition can only be explained as part of an interacting sequence of 5 \nevents at different time scales, rather than by a simple change in competitive strength (see Fig. 6 \n1). 7 \n 8 \nFirstly, increased N availability stimulates biomass and litter production of the dominant dwarf 9 \nshrub in most situations (e.g. Heil and Diemont 1983; Aerts and Heil 1993, Power et al. 1995, 10 \nBobbink et al. 1998: Marcos et al. 2003), although some inland dry heaths are limited by P or 11 \nK (e.g. Nielsen et al. 2000). Nitrogen is strongly retained in the system, as ammonium 12 \nimmobilization in the soil is high and leaching losses are very low (e.g. De Boer 1989, 13 \nBerendse 1990, Power et al. 1998, Kristensen and McCarty 1999, Nielsen et al. 2000). The 14 \nincrease in N content stimulates microbial activity and leads to higher N mineralization rates 15 \n(Berendse 1990, Power et al. 1998). However, the dwarf shrub species remains a stronger 16 \ncompetitor than grasses if the canopy is not opened (Aerts et al. 1990; Aerts 1993). The shift 17 \nfrom dwarf shrub to grass dominance needs to be triggered by opening of the canopy, for 18 \nexample by heather beetle attacks, winter injury or drought, which in turn is more likely when 19 \nN concentrations in the plants are higher (Bobbink & Lamers, 2002). Grasses then quickly 20 \nprofit from the increased light intensity, together with the high N availability, and this may lead 21 \nwithin a few years to an increase in grass cover and decline in dwarf shrubs (e.g. Heil and 22 \nDiemont 1983). The stochastic and long-term nature of several of the key interacting processes 23 \nmake it difficult to clarify experimentally all the relationships even in long-term studies. 24 \nTherefore, computer models have provided an important tool to demonstrate the importance of 25 \nBobbink et al. \n 21\nN deposition acting over decades with secondary stresses and under different management 1 \nregimes (e.g. Heil and Bobbink 1993, Terry et al., 2004).  2 \n 3 \nThere is evidence that typical heathland lichen and moss species can be negatively affected by 4 \nN deposition before a shift from dwarf shrubs to grasses occurs (e.g. Cladonia spp; Parmelia 5 \n(Barker 2001); Hypnum spp. (Lee and Caporn 2001); Cladonia spp. (Tomassen et al. 2004)). 6 \nThese declines are unlikely to be caused by the direct toxic effects of N, but probably are due 7 \nto increased shading through the greater canopy density of heather. This has been confirmed by 8 \nexperimental removal of the shoots, which caused rapid recovery of the lichens (Barker 2001).  9 \n 10 \n2.4.3. Effects on grasslands 11 \nThe impacts of N enrichment on species composition and diversity are relatively well studied 12 \nexperimentally in European species-rich grasslands (Bobbink et al. 2003). Bobbink (2004) 13 \nanalysed the effects of N deposition on plant species richness in semi-natural grassland using 14 \nEuropean field addition experiments with N addition treatments for at least 2 years. The 15 \nexperiments in this synthesis included both dry and wet grasslands and a range of soil pHs 16 \n(acid \u2013 calcareous) in six countries across Europe. A significant negative relationship between 17 \nspecies richness and N addition was found for these temperate, semi-natural grasslands (Fig. 18 \n2), and there was a steep reduction of ca. 40 % of the species richness occurring over the 19 \naddition range 0-40 kg N ha-1 yr-1. The loss of species characteristic of a particular ecosystem 20 \nmay be higher than indicated by overall species richness, because some fast growing species 21 \n(especially graminoids) invaded in high N treatments and were not present in the controls. 22 \n 23 \nThese findings are consistent with the results of long-term studies in North America, in which a 24 \nrange of rates of N deposition (10 \u2013 95 kg N ha-1 yr-1) over a total of 23 years to three old fields 25 \non former prairie rangeland and one natural prairie vegetation, in an area with a background 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 22\ndeposition estimated to be 6 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Recent analysis by Clark and Tilman (2008), and 1 \nearlier analysis of one field by Haddad et al. (2000) highlight that the greatest loss of plant 2 \nspecies numbers occurred over lower addition rates, in the range 10-50 kg N ha-1 yr-1 . The 3 \ntime required to detect consistent and significant reductions in species numbers varied from 4 \nthree to nine years, depending on the N addition rate; thus, given sufficient time, relatively low 5 \nN deposition inputs can significantly impact plant species biodiversity. Clark and Tilman 6 \n(2008) highlight that the effects was greatest on rare species, because of their lower initial 7 \nabundance. A greater effect of N deposition on rare than common species of heathland and 8 \nacidic grassland species was also identified in field studies in the Netherlands by Kleijn et al. 9 \n(2008), and attributed to their narrower ecological amplitude.  10 \n 11 \nOne problem with interpretation of these field experiments is that species may already have 12 \nbeen lost in areas where ambient N loads exceed 20 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Experiments in which N 13 \nload is reduced below ambient levels are rare but can provide useful information on such 14 \neffects. For example, the cover of the moss species Racomitrium in acid grassland increased 3-15 \n4 times after reduction to pre-industrial loads (2-3 N ha-1 yr-1) from an ambient-load of 20 kg N 16 \nha-1 yr-1 (Jones et al. 2002, Emmett 2007). This suggests that this species may already have 17 \nbeen affected by historical N deposition and stresses the importance of studies in low N input 18 \nareas 19 \n 20 \nSuch information is relevant to the interpretation of field studies in which species composition 21 \nof grassland ecosystems is compared across a gradient of N deposition. Stevens et al. (2004) 22 \nreported a UK-wide survey of acidic grasslands across a gradient of N deposition from 5 to 35 23 \nkg N ha-1 yr-1 and found that the plant species richness in a 2 x 2 m plot declined as a function 24 \nof the rate of inorganic N deposition. This was more strongly related to reduced N deposition 25 \nthan oxidised N (Stevens et al. 2006). Stevens et al. (2004) estimated a reduction of one species 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 23\nfor every 2.5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 of N deposition, but also identify that this may be due to long-term 1 \ncumulative deposition of N over decades, rather than current deposition. 2 \n 3 \nRelatively few experimental studies grassland responses have considered the underlying 4 \nmechanisms. The results of the study of Clark and Tilman (2008) can be attributed to 5 \neutrophication effects of N inputs, because acidification was prevented by liming, and addition 6 \nof other nutrients, including P, precluded them becoming limiting.  However, Horswill et al. 7 \n(2008) identify the importance of acidification and base cation depletion in responses to N 8 \ndeposition in experiments on both an acidic and calcareous grassland, while a recent meta-9 \nanalysis of North American field experiments (Clark et al., 2007) suggests that species loss is 10 \nless marked on sites with higher pH and cation exchange capacity. Both Bobbink (1991) and 11 \nPhoenix et al. (2003) demonstrated increased P demands in species of different functional 12 \ngroups in response to N addition to calcareous grasslands limited by P or N and P together. 13 \nThis suggests that such responses are important adaptations to increased N deposition and 14 \ncrucial for the long-term consequences of N deposition in other severely P-limited systems, 15 \nsuch as in the tropics.        16 \n 17 \n2.4.4 Thresholds for nitrogen deposition impacts 18 \nIn most European heathland experiments, dwarf shrub growth is increased by added N inputs 19 \nabove 15 \u2013 20 kg N ha-1 yr-1.while lichens and mosses can be negatively affected at deposition 20 \nrates above 10 \u2013 15 kg ha-1 yr-1. However, the shift from dwarf shrub to grass dominance 21 \ndepends not only on N deposition, but also complex ecosystem interactions and management 22 \nmethods. Effects on plant species richness in species-rich semi-natural grasslands have been 23 \nreported above N loads of ca. 15-20 kg N ha-1 yr-1. However, the longest published experiment 24 \nshows significant effects even at very low N inputs (10 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and it may be that there 25 \nis simply no threshold for these changes if the duration of the experiments is sufficiently long. 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 24\n 1 \n2.5 Mediterranean vegetation 2 \nCharacteristics 3 \nMediterranean vegetation is characterised by annual grasses and forbs, evergreen shrubs and 4 \nsclerophyll trees, forming annual grasslands, typical shrublands, woodlands or forest stands. 5 \nThese communities have adapted to the distinctive climatic conditions, with summer drought 6 \nand cool moist winters (Archibold 1995).  Soils in Mediterranean systems are typically base 7 \nrich compared to mesic systems and as a result acidification effects are less important than 8 \neutrophication impacts. Nitrogen accumulation, which enhances the spread of nitrophilous and 9 \nsome invasive species, is the dominant mechanism by which biodiversity effects occur in 10 \nMediterranean ecosystems (Technical Annexe 1; Fenn et al. 2003a, 2008).  11 \n 12 \nEffects on grasslands 13 \nSoils on serpentinitic rock in the San Francisco Bay area are low in N and support a diverse 14 \nnative grassland with more than 100 species of forbs and grasses. In an area near San Jose, 15 \nCalifornia with N deposition as high as 10\u201315 kg kg N ha-1 yr-1 exotic annual grasses have 16 \ninvaded and replaced many native species. Exotic grasses are replacing native forbs, including 17 \nthe larval host plants of the rare and endangered Bay Checkerspot Butterfly, which has been 18 \ndeclining steadily, with local extirpations in some reserves (Weiss 1999). When the impacted 19 \ngrasslands are grazed with cattle, native plant species survive, because cattle preferably select 20 \ngrasses over forbs and grazing leads to a net export of N from the site (Weiss, 1999). A 21 \nroadside deposition gradient studied demonstrated that exotic grasses exclude native species in 22 \nserpentine grasslands with N deposition as low as 5 kg ha-1 yr-1 (Stuart Weiss, pers. comm.). 23 \nFertilization studies in California grasslands have also shown that invasives become dominant 24 \n(Huenneke et al. 1990) and N-fixing species can be exterminated in N enriched sites (Zavaleta 25 \net al. 2003; Technical Annexe 1).  26 \nBobbink et al. \n 25\nIn Europe, the impacts of N inputs on biodiversity of Mediterranean terrestrial systems have 1 \nonly been reported for a grassland in Italy (Bonanomi et al. 2006). Nitrogen (35 kg ha-1 yr-1) 2 \nwas added for 3 years in plots with and without litter removal or vegetation cutting. Nitrogen 3 \nenrichment strongly increased the aboveground living biomass, while maintaining very low 4 \nspecies diversity. Species diversity was negatively related to the above-ground biomass of the 5 \nnative grass Brachypodium rupestre, as found earlier for B. pinnatum in temperate calcareous 6 \ngrasslands (Bobbink and Willems 1987). 7 \n 8 \nEffects on coastal sage scrub 9 \nDuring the last half century native coastal sage scrub (CSS) habitat in the Riverside-Perris 10 \nPlain located ca. 100 km inland from Los Angeles, California has undergone a major decline as 11 \na result of the establishment of invasive Mediterranean grasses (Allen et al. 2005, Fenn et al. 12 \n2003a; Minnich and Dezzani 1998). Invasion by grasses and the decline of native species cover 13 \nand forb richness are most severe in the more northerly end of the Riverside-Perris Plain 14 \n(Minnich and Dezzani 1998) where N deposition is > 10 kg ha-1 yr-1 and levels of soil N are as 15 \nmuch as five times greater (Padgett et al. 1999; Edie Allen, pers.comm.).   16 \nIn field fertilization experiments, percent cover, and particularly the biomass,of exotic grasses, 17 \nincreased, especially during wet years, but the CSS vegetation did not increase in biomass even 18 \nafter 8 years of fertilization at 60 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (Allen et al. 2005, Fenn et al. 2003a). Long- 19 \nterm experiments showed that Artemisia and Encelia suffer greater senescence and mortality 20 \nafter 6-9 months of growth in soils where extractable N is maintained at 30-50 \u00b5g g-1, similar 21 \nto levels that occur in the dry season in polluted sites. However, because CSS vegetation is 22 \nsummer deciduous, it is not known to what extent the elevated soil N levels directly impact the 23 \nCSS vegetation. The exotic invasive grasses escape any potential long-term nutrient stress by 24 \nhaving a short lifespan with high seed production. The diversity and density of arbuscular 25 \nmycorrhizal spores in soil at CSS sites along a N-depostion gradient was significantly reduced 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 26\nat high N deposition sites (> 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1; Egerton-Warburton and Allen 2000; Sig\u00fcenza et 1 \nal. 2006a) along an urban to rural N deposition gradient (Padgett et al. 1999). Further studies 2 \nsuggested a negative feedback of N deposition mediated via selection for growth depressing 3 \nmycorrhizal strains that are not effective mutualists (Sig\u00fcenza et al. 2006b). 4 \n 5 \nEffects on chaparral 6 \nCalifornia chaparral communities are highly stable and resistant to alien invasives, (Burns and 7 \nSauer 1992, Keeley et al. 2003) except when mechanically disturbed or in ecotones. However 8 \nhistorical N enrichment of soils in pure chaparral stands of Eriogonum fasciculatum var. 9 \nfoliolosum Nutt. and Adenostoma fasciculatum Hook. & Arn. near Los Angeles was associated 10 \nwith dramatic changes in the mycorrhizal community (Egerton-Warburton et al. 2001). 11 \nDiversity, species richness, and productivity of the arbuscular mycorrhizal community had 12 \ndeteriorated severely by 1969. Three previously common mycorrhizal genera disappeared from 13 \nthe mycorrhizal spore community in soil and one large-spored genera (Gigasopora) was no 14 \nlonger found in plant roots. N enrichment also enhanced the proliferation of potentially less 15 \nmutualistic species of small-spored Glomus, which may have implications for plant community 16 \nsuccession in the face of chronic N deposition (Egerton-Warburton et al. 2001).  17 \n 18 \nEffects on forests 19 \nThe most dramatic documented plant response to N in Mediterranean forests are the changes in 20 \nlichen communities, even at low levels of N deposition. Using simple indices of lichen 21 \nfunctional groups, N loads were defined that correspond with major shifts in lichen 22 \ncommunities in mixed conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada of California. The most protective 23 \nrate of N deposition for lichen community impacts based on exceedance of a N concentration 24 \nthreshold in the lichen Letharia vulpina was ca. 3 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (Fenn et al. 2008). At this level 25 \nof N deposition, the lichen community composition was already shifting from sensitive to more 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 27\nN-tolerant species. At an estimated N deposition of ca. 6 kg ha-1 yr-1 the lichen community had 1 \nshifted from the natural state of acidophyte (defined as highly N sensitive species) dominance. 2 \nThis is of particular concern because of the links of acidophyte species to food webs and other 3 \nwildlife use (McCune et al., 2007). The data from this study predict a complete extirpation of 4 \nacidophytes from the lichen community at an N load of 10.2 kg ha-1 yr-1. This work 5 \ndemonstrates that known biological impacts are occurring at N deposition levels as low as 3-5 6 \nkg ha-1 yr-1, levels which are exceeded over large areas of the Mediterranean forests of 7 \nCalifornia (Fenn et al. 2003c, 2008). 8 \nUnderstorey diversity in mixed conifer forests in the San Bernardino Mountains in southern 9 \nCalifornia was recently compared to studies done 30 years prior in 1973 (Allen et al. 2007). 10 \nBiodiversity loss was pronounced in the most polluted sites and is due to the establishment of 11 \ninvasive species that have become abundant. In three of six sites, including the two 12 \nwesternmost polluted sites, 20-40% of species were lost between 1973 and 2003. Because of 13 \nconfounding factors such as precipitation and possibly local disturbances, a simple correlation 14 \nwas not found between air pollution and patterns of native and invasive species cover and 15 \nrichness (Allen et al., 2007). Co-occurring ozone may be indirectly contributing to the 16 \nestablishment of exotic species as well. Ozone causes premature foliage loss in pine, while N 17 \ndeposition stimulates foliar growth, leading to greater litter production and accumulation in the 18 \nforest floor (Fenn et al. 2003b). Many native plant species are not able to establish where dense 19 \nlitter accumulates. However, Galium aparine, an exotic annual from Europe, thrives under 20 \nthese conditions, which include the acidified N-rich soils that underlie the thick litter layer.  21 \n 22 \nThresholds for nitrogen deposition impacts 23 \nIt can be concluded that the impacts of N in European Mediterranean vegetation have been 24 \nlittle studied (only one N addition experiment in the whole region). Evidence from California 25 \nshows that it is likely that several changes (increases in exotic grasses, decline in native 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 28\nspecies, and in mycorrhizal communities) can occur at increased N inputs at rather low loads 1 \n(10 \u2013 15 kg N ha-1 yr-1). The most sensitive part of the studied forests was the epiphytic lichen 2 \ncommunity, which was influenced at N inputs around 3 \u2013 5 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Clearly, more long-3 \nterm experiments are needed to better characterize these responses in a larger number of 4 \nMediterranean ecosystems.  5 \n 6 \n2.6 Arid vegetation (desert and semi-desert) 7 \nCharacteristics 8 \nThe arid regions of the world occupy 26-35 % of the Earth\u2019s land surface, mostly between 15o 9 \nand 30o latitude (Archibold 1995). Semi-desert and deserts occur in the tropics and temperate 10 \nregions. In temperate deserts temperatures are very high in summer, but can drop considerably 11 \nin winter. In all deserts there is a deficiency of precipitation, and the dryness is often intensified 12 \nby high evaporation rates and by coarse soils which retain little moisture. Desert and semi-13 \ndesert ecosystems are generally considered not to be sensitive to increased N loads because of 14 \nthe overwhelming drought, and they are mainly present in regions with very low N deposition 15 \nwith the exception of some desert regions in the SW United States (Fenn et al. 2003c).  16 \n 17 \nNitrogen manipulation studies 18 \nThe effects of N deposition on native and invasive species in a desert ecosystem has been 19 \nstudied in a fertilization and N deposition gradient study in Joshua Tree National Park, 20 \nCalifornia. N deposition increased the amount of N mineralized and thus the rate of soil N 21 \nsupply. However, sites with rocky or gravelly soils did not have high exotic grass cover, and 22 \nmaintained high native cover even under elevated N deposition. In contrast, on sandy soils 23 \nelevated soil N increased exotic grass cover to the detriment of associated native forbs. 24 \nIncreased exotic grass cover was observed in response to an additional 5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at a low 25 \ndeposition site (3.4 kg ha-1 yr-1) in 2005 which was a wet year (Allen et al. 2008). In a drier 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 29\nyear only the 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1 treatment elicited a similar response. Few other studies have 1 \nbeen published of relevance to possible effects of N deposition on plant communities in 2 \ndeserts, except for short-term experiments with relatively high N treatments (e.g., 20-100 kg 3 \nha-1 yr-1; B\u00e1ez et al. 2007, Brooks 2003, Schwinning et al. 2005; Technical Annexe 1). 4 \n  5 \nThresholds for nitrogen deposition impacts 6 \nEvidence for N deposition effects in arid regions is very limited, although recent studies from 7 \nCalifornia suggest that arid ecosystems may be more responsive to N deposition than 8 \npreviously assumed. In some deserts and semi-deserts changes in plant species and increases in 9 \ninvasive grasses have been observed after N additions, indicating that arid systems can be 10 \nsensitive to increasing N deposition, particularly in areas where exotic species have been 11 \nintroduced. 12 \n 13 \n2.7 Tropical vegetation 14 \nTropical savannas 15 \nCharacteristics 16 \nTropical savannas cover about one-eighth of the global land surface and are characterized by a 17 \nnear continuous grass\/herbaceous stratum and a discontinuous layer of trees and shrubs of 18 \nvariable density (Bourli\u00e8re and Hadley 1983 in Mistry, 2000).  The climate is strongly seasonal 19 \nand the dry season can last 2-9 months (Frost et al. 1986).  Savanna ecosystems are controlled 20 \nby the interactions among water, and nutrient availability and disturbance (Medina 1987, 21 \nSarmiento 1996).   The relative importance of disturbance (fire, grazing and browsing) in 22 \nsuppression of tree cover depends on soil nutrient status and primary productivity as observed 23 \nby Blackmore et al. (1990).   There are few studies dealing specifically with the effects of 24 \nincreasing N availability on the diversity (composition and abundance of species and plant life 25 \nBobbink et al. \n 30\nforms) of savanna ecosystems. The time scale and amount of N applied in these studies are also 1 \nvariable.   2 \n 3 \nEffects on the herbaceous layer 4 \nShorter-term experiments (i.e. 1- 2 years) in a  secondary coastal savanna in Venezuela with 5 \nhigh nutrient addition (e.g. >200 kg ha-1 of N, P and K) have shown increased cover of sedges 6 \nin response to N with no change in plant composition (Barger et al. 2002) while  no response of 7 \nN addition alone was observed in seasonally flooded savanna  but differences in growth 8 \nresponse of grass species to combinations of N, P, K and S suggested a temporal division of 9 \nnutrient resources (Sarmiento et al. 2006). However, the relationship among traits such as 10 \ncompetitive ability, composition and diversity in short-term studies may not reflect vegetation 11 \nprocesses in the long-term, because traits of the initial dominants may be unrelated to the long-12 \nterm outcome of competition. A long-term experiment from 1950- present applied N (71-212 13 \nkg ha-1 yr-1), P (336 kg ha -1 yr-1) and lime to a grassland in South Africa (Fynn et al. 2005).  14 \nBotanical composition in all plots was sampled between 1951 and 1999.  Averaged over 30 15 \nyears, N fertilization increased above-ground primary productivity (ANPP) by 29 \u2013 37 % 16 \nwhereas N+P increased ANPP by 68 \u2013 74 %.  Control plots demonstrated remarkable 17 \ncompositional stability over 50 years while, in the long-term, fertilization resulted in dramatic 18 \nchanges in species abundance and composition. N fertilization reduced the abundance of most 19 \nspecies, especially of forb species (up to 94 %). Fertilization with P or lime alone had little 20 \neffect on ANPP and richness, but after N fertilization and liming the reduction in abundance 21 \nand species number was less profound than after only N addition. This clearly revealed that the 22 \nimpacts of N or its chemical form (ammonium sulphate or ammonium nitrate) on plant 23 \ndiversity was partly caused by soil acidification. The general trend was for most species with a 24 \nshort stature to decline in abundance with increasing levels of N fertilization, whereas most tall 25 \nspecies peaked at some level of N fertilization. However, not all tall species were competitive 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 31\nin N-fertilized sites suggesting that other traits, like shade-tolerance or P economy, were 1 \ninvolved. 2 \nFeedbacks among N enrichment, grass productivity and herbivory can result in bottom-up 3 \nregulation of savanna ecosystems with consequences for vegetation structure and diversity.  In 4 \nAfrican savannas, it was demonstrated that large native and domestic herbivores selectively 5 \nused and intensively grazed nutrient-rich sites with consumption rates increasing linearly with 6 \nANPP and that they also maintain the N-enriched status of grazed sites through deposition of 7 \ndung and urine (Augustine, 2003).     8 \n 9 \nThe effects of increasing nutrient availability on the competitiveness of African grasses against 10 \nnative grasses of Neotropical savannas have been documented in Venezuelan and Brazilian 11 \nsavannas.  In a short term (one growing season) study, the cultivation of the African grass, 12 \nAndropogon gayanus, and the native grass species, Paspalum plicatulum in dystrophic savanna 13 \nsoils in Venezuela (fertilized with 70 kg N ha-1 or 30 kg K ha-1 or 102 kg P ha-1; and NPK 14 \ncombined) showed that the African species is more dependent on P supply for maximal 15 \ngrowth, while showing higher N use efficiency than the South American grass (Bilbao and 16 \nMedina, 1990). Long-term effects were observed in a fertilization experiment (100 kg N ha-1 y-17 \n1, 100 kg P ha-1 y-1 and N and P combined) conducted in a savanna on dystrophic soil in central 18 \nBrazil since 1998.  After seven years of fertilization, the invasion of the plots by the African 19 \ngrass Melinis minutiflora implied changes in species dominance. M. minutiflora was found to 20 \noutcompete the native C3 grass E.inflexa in N + P treatments but not under N or P alone.  21 \nNative C4 grasses showed lower biomass values under all nutrient enrichment treatments, but 22 \nespecially when N was added, suggesting that they are less competitive under higher nutrient 23 \navailability (Luedemann, Bustamante et al. unpublished). These results indicate that long-term 24 \nnutrient addition is leading to loss of biodiversity of the herbaceous layer and favouring the 25 \ninvasion by exotic grasses. 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 32\n 1 \nEffects on the woody layer 2 \nThe response of savanna woody plants to N deposition is less investigated than those of the 3 \nherbaceous layer. Physiological processes were studied in five dominant woody species in the 4 \nCerrado to determine whether N enrichment would have an effect on their pattern of carbon 5 \nallocation and water relations. N addition affected the physiology of Cerrado woody species in 6 \na manner that prevented Cerrado trees responding to temporal variation in soil water resources 7 \n(Scholz et al. 2007, Bucci et al. 2007).  Cerrado woody species also exhibited variable 8 \nresponses in terms of nutrient foliar concentrations and resorption efficiency to N and P 9 \nfertilization.  However, at community level, changes in leaf chemistry and litter quality under 10 \ncombined N and P addition accelerated the decomposition rate (Kozovits et al. 2007).  These 11 \nresults indicate that in seasonally dry tropical ecosystems, besides interactions between N and 12 \nP, changes in water use efficiency might be related to responses to N enrichment with 13 \nconsequences to species abundance and composition.  Long-term impacts of N addition might 14 \nalso include negative responses of woody plant seedlings to the increased biomass of the 15 \nherbaceous layer but, on the other hand, the increase total leaf area of woody layer under the 16 \naddition of N (Bucci, 2001) might result in a negative feedback for the above-ground 17 \nproductivity of the herbaceous layer.   18 \n 19 \nTropical forests 20 \nCharacteristics 21 \nTropical forests represent important storehouses for biodiversity (Mittermeier et al. 1998). A 22 \nbroad range of tropical forest types exists (e.g. Archibald 1995), but here we only distinguish 23 \nthree broad categories, namely tropical lowland rainforest, tropical montane forest and tropical 24 \ndry forest. It is widely accepted that many tropical forests are P-limited, N-rich and have open 25 \nN cycles in comparison to most temperate forests. Tropical forests with an efficient within-26 \nBobbink et al. \n 33\nstand N economy are either montane forest or lowland forest located on sandy soils (e.g. 1 \nMatson et al. 1999, Martinelli et al. 1999).  2 \nThe impact of N deposition on plant diversity of tropical forests is still an open question? In the 3 \nlast 30 years, studies in different types of tropical forests have focused on the effects of nutrient 4 \nadditions on productivity (LeBauer and Treseder 2008). In addition, the relatively high level of 5 \nfertilizer application used in the experiments is clearly much higher than the present-day 6 \ngradients of anthropogenic deposition of N. The high compositional and structural diversity of 7 \nalmost all tropical forests presents an additional challenge for interpreting results of nutrient 8 \naddition experiments, because not all species in the ecosystem are nutrient limited, even when 9 \nthe overall ecosystem processes are.  10 \n 11 \nEffects on tropical rain forest (lowland) 12 \nIn tropical rain forest broad-leaf trees rise to 30 to 45 m, forming a dense multi-layer canopy. 13 \nGiant lianas and epiphytes are abundant. The forest is mostly evergreen, but the individual tree 14 \nspecies have different leaf-shedding cycles. These forests are found on highly weathered, 15 \ncation depleted acid clay Oxisols with high Al concentrations and high P depletion and on soils 16 \nformed on white sands. The organic matter content of the soil is low (ca. 2 %) and 17 \ndecomposition and mineralization rates are high.  18 \nNeotropical rain forests, particularly the Amazon forest, have been considered the most 19 \nspecies-rich forests worldwide and spatial patterns of species richness have been detected (e.g. 20 \nGentry 1988, ter Steege et al. 2000). Phillips et al. (2004) showed that trees 10 cm or more in 21 \ndiameter recruit and die twice as fast on the richer soils of southern and western Amazonia than 22 \non the poorer soils of eastern and central Amazonia. 23 \n 24 \nAlthough tree growth may be nutrient limited in many forests (Tamm 1990, Tanner et al. 1992, 25 \nVitousek et al. 1993, Aber et al. 1995), severe light limitation on the forest floor is often 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 34\nthought to prevent responses of understorey plants to increasing nutrient availability. Climbing 1 \nplants and lianas are conspicuous and play an important part in tropical forests being efficient 2 \nand flexible in light foraging (Bigelow 1993). The increased soil nutrient availability 3 \n(equivalent to 220 kg N ha-1 yr-1, 55 kg P ha-1 yr-1 and 110 kg K ha-1 yr-1) stimulated seedling 4 \ngrowth of three liana species in Panama, despite extremely low light availability (0.8%-2.2% of 5 \nfull sun) (H\u00e4ttenschwiler 2002).  Although the response to addition of N alone was not studied, 6 \nthe results highlighted that responses to increasing N availability might affect all forest layers. 7 \nA recent study in an old-growth tropical forest in southeastern China, found that four years of 8 \nexperimental additions of 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1 decreased herbaceous layer species richness nearly 9 \n40% relative to controls and that additions of 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1 decreased richness by around 10 \n75% relative to controls (Lu Xiankai, pers. comm.). This indicates that N enrichment can 11 \ninfluence the species richness of the understorey. 12 \n  13 \nEffects on secondary lowland forests and succession after disturbance 14 \nDisturbance regimes in the tropics might change community composition as responses to 15 \nnutrient availability become more important than responses to light availability (as in small 16 \ngaps) when light is less limiting. Tropical forests are experiencing intense land use change and 17 \nwith increasing deforestation rates young secondary forests are becoming more important as a 18 \nreservoir of biodiversity.  Evidence for positive growth response and luxury consumption 19 \namong light-demanding species suggests that P, rather than N, should limit seedling 20 \nperformance and may ultimately influence tree diversity in young secondary tropical forests. In 21 \na literature review Lawrence (2003) reported growth responses of seedlings (critical stage in 22 \nrecruitment following successful colonization of a site) in a total of 91 tropical forests.  23 \nAlthough most of the experiments were conducted in pots and with addition of NPK that 24 \nprevents the evaluation of responses to single nutrients, most of the species (73% of light-25 \ndemanding and 60% of shade-tolerant) responded positively to fertilization but the magnitude 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 35\nof the response of light-demanding species was more than twice that of shade-tolerant species.  1 \nThis suggests that nutrient enrichment could affect the structure of tropical forests regenerating 2 \nfrom large-scale disturbance.  In more fertile sites, competitive exclusion may occur within the 3 \nlight-demanding species, resulting in a decline in local tree diversity. Siddique, Davidson, 4 \nVieira et al. (unpublished) conducted 2-yr experimental N and P addition (100 kg N ha-1 yr-1; 5 \n50 kg P ha-1 yr-1 and N+P together) in an abandoned pasture in eastern Amazonia. The two 6 \nlarge applications of N and P conferred only short-lived tree woody biomass responses, 7 \nprimarily to N, and partly to P. Both N and P addition shifted relative tree species growth 8 \ntowards few, responsive species, and delayed increases in tree species richness and reduced 9 \nevenness. Consistent negative effects of N\u00d7P interactions on tree biomass growth and diversity 10 \nwere attributed to dramatic, positive N\u00d7P interactions in grass growth responses.  This result 11 \ndemonstrates that interactions within and among life forms and at multiple hierarchical levels 12 \nof functional diversity have to be considered in the Amazon Basin. Furthermore, Davidson et 13 \nal. (2007) demonstrated, through the comparison of forest chronosequences (stands ranging in 14 \nage from 3 to 70 years and remnant mature forests in eastern Amazonia- Par\u00e1), changes in N 15 \nlimitation with succession.  Young successional forests growing after agricultural abandonment 16 \non a highly weathered lowland tropical soils exhibited conservative N cycling properties.  As 17 \nsecondary succession progressed, N cycling properties recovered with increasing availability of 18 \nsoil nitrate relative to ammonium. The dominance of a conservative P cycle typical of mature 19 \nlowland tropical forests re-emerged (Davidson et al. 2007).  20 \n 21 \nEffects on tropical montane forest 22 \nIn comparison to lowland forests, montane tropical forest growth and distribution is limited by 23 \ndecreasing air temperature and increasing cloudiness (Grubb 1977).  Erosion on steep slopes 24 \ncan prevent the accumulation of deep soil and can cause renewed exposure of bedrock to 25 \nweathering, thus maintaining a supply of mineral-derived nutrients, such as Ca, Mg, K, and P.  26 \nBobbink et al. \n 36\nNutrient supply and other factors such as soil base saturation are also controlled by temperature 1 \nand precipitation.  Several studies have shown that the concentration of major nutrients in 2 \nmature foliage, above-ground biomass and litter fall of montane rain forests are generally lower 3 \nthan in lowland rain forests (Grubb 1977, Tanner 1985, Vitousek 1984).  Fertilization 4 \nexperiments in tropical montane forests were summarized by Tanner et al. 1998, who noted 5 \nconsiderable variability among these systems.  At any altitude it is possible to find forests with 6 \nlow, intermediate, and high concentrations of nutrients, but low-stature forests generally have 7 \nlow concentrations of N and P at any elevation. They concluded that wet montane tropical 8 \nforests are most likely limited by N. This conclusion is recently confirmed by the meta-analysis 9 \nof LeBauer and Treseder (2008). They found a significant positive relationship between plant 10 \nproduction and N additions in tropical montane forest studies (n = 8).  It became clear that 11 \ntropical montane forest has a much more closed N cycle and is low in N. In addition, base 12 \nsaturation is moderate in most soils of these forests, which can imply a rather high sensitivity 13 \nto soil acidification with losses of cations and increases in aluminium due to increased N 14 \ninputs. 15 \nOsterlag & Verville (2002) applied 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1  for at least 10 years to a stand of wet 16 \nmontane forest on young soils (200-400 yrs old; N-limited) and to a stand on very old soils (ca. 17 \n4.1 million yrs; P-limited) on Hawaii. They found a significant increase of non-native invaders 18 \nin the youngest stand, with a significant reduction in species richness. At the P-limited site, N 19 \nnor P addition did cause change in species composition or diversity. This may indicate that 20 \nspecies composition and diversity can be influenced by increased atmospheric N loads in N-21 \nlimited tropical montane forests, but data are extremely scarce to generalize this observation. 22 \n 23 \nEffects on tropical dry forest 24 \nSeasonally tropical dry forest occur in tropical regions with several months of severe or 25 \nabsolute drought (Mooney et al. 1995) and are frequently connected to savannas because they 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 37\noccur under the same climatic conditions, although they are often found in soils of higher 1 \nfertility.  Studies of N deposition impacts on the diversity of these systems are practically 2 \nnonexistent. Campo & Dirzo (2003) conducted a fertilization experiment in secondary tropical 3 \ndry forests growing on limestone in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula (M\u00e9xico) where one sector was 4 \nabandoned ~60 yrs ago (old secondary forest) and another sector 10 yrs ago.  Both sectors were 5 \nnutrient-poor but the old forest area had soils with higher availability of P.  Plots at each forest 6 \nwere either left intact (controls) or fertilized with N (220 kg ha-1 yr-1), with P (75 kg ha-1 yr-1) 7 \nor with N plus P for three consecutive years (1998-2000) in two pulses, at the end of the dry 8 \nseason and in the middle of the rainy season.  Interactions between changes in leaf quality and 9 \nherbivory were observed at the young site but not at the older sites indicating that regulatory 10 \nmechanisms between leaf quality and damage by herbivores are dependent on site\u2019s nutrient 11 \nlimitations and species composition. Although the study did not focus on species diversity, it 12 \nreinforces that the interactions of N and P are also relevant in tropical dry forest. 13 \n 14 \nThresholds for nitrogen deposition impacts 15 \nIn many tropical systems, P is often the important limiting resource for plant growth. 16 \nResponses to increased N availability are highly connected to interactions between N and 17 \nP. Additionally, in these extremely species-rich and structurally diverse ecosystems, responses 18 \nare often species-specific or are specific to a particular life form.  These differential responses 19 \nand high level of connectivity among species can affect the outcome of competition in complex 20 \nways, through interactions of nutrient-supported growth with competition for light, water, and 21 \nother nutrients as well as responses to herbivory and pathogens. Evidence from N addition 22 \nexperiments in tropical savannas and forests suggest the potential for short-term decreases in 23 \nspecies richness. This evidence is, unfortunately, biased, because the N additions were large 24 \nand mostly applied for only brief experimental periods.  Although setting of an effect 25 \nthresholds is not possible at this moment, it is suggested that the long-term impact of enhanced 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 38\nN deposition could lead to changes in species composition and richness in some of the tropical 1 \necosystems.  2 \n 3 \n3. Mechanisms for plant diversity effects of increased N deposition \u2013 a synthesis 4 \n 5 \nGeneralisation of the impact of N on different ecosystems around the world is difficult, 6 \nconsidering the overall complexity of both the N cycling in ecosystems and the responses to N 7 \nadditions, but this global assessment shows that there are clearly general features of the N 8 \neffect chain that can be distinguished for several major ecosystems types. The series of events 9 \nthat occur when N deposition has increased in a region with originally low background 10 \ndeposition rates is highly complex. Many biotic and abiotic processes interact and operate at 11 \ndifferent time scales and an accepted scheme derived for temperate ecosystems in the northern 12 \nhemisphere is given in Fig. 1.  13 \nIn an attempt to gain an understanding of how applicable this type of scheme is to ecosystems 14 \noutside the  well-studied areas of the northern hemisphere, we have analysed the experimental 15 \nsetup and results of the studies cited in section 2 to determine likely mechanisms for the plant 16 \ndiversity effects of N additions  (see Technical Annexe 1). The most likely combination of 17 \nmechanisms behind the observed changes to plant diversity is identified and scored for its 18 \nrelative importance (where 1 is \u2018low importance\u2019 and 5 is \u2018main driver\u2019). The results are 19 \nsummarised in Table 1 and consistently show that N accumulation in the ecosystem is the main 20 \ndriver of changes to species composition across the whole range of major ecosystem types, 21 \nwhere doses of Nr of varying amount, composition, frequency, and duration of application 22 \noften reduce or change terrestrial and wetland above-ground diversity. Enhanced N inputs 23 \nresult in a gradual increase in the availability of soil N. This leads to an increase in plant 24 \nproductivity in N-limited vegetation and thus higher litter production. Because of this, N 25 \nmineralization will gradually increase, which may cause enhanced plant productivity and in the 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 39\nlonger term competitive exclusion of characteristic species by relatively fast-growing 1 \nnitrophilic species.  In general, nitrophilic species as grasses, sedges and exotics are the 2 \n\u2018winners\u2019 and less nitrophilic species such as forbs of small stature, dwarf shrubs, lichens and 3 \nmosses,  the \u2018losers.  The rate of N cycling in the ecosystem is clearly enhanced in this 4 \nsituation. When the natural N deficiencies in an ecosystem are fully fulfilled, plant growth 5 \nbecomes restricted by other resources, such as P and productivity will not increase further. This 6 \nparticularly important in regions such as the tropics that already have very low soil P 7 \navailability (Vitousek et al. this volume). N concentrations in the plants will, however, increase 8 \nwith enhanced N inputs in these P-limited regions, which may seriously affect the palatability 9 \nof the vegetation and thus cause increased risk of (insect) herbivory. In this situation N 10 \nconcentration in litter increase with raised N inputs, leading to extra stimulation of N 11 \nmineralization rates. Because of this imbalance between N and P, plant species which have 12 \nhighly efficient P economy, gradually profit and species composition can be changed in this 13 \nway without increased plant productivity. Finally, the ecosystem becomes \u2018N-saturated, which 14 \nleads to an increased (risk of) N leaching from the soil to the deeper ground water or of 15 \ngaseous fluxes (N2 & N2O) to the atmosphere (e.g. Bobbink et al. 2003).   16 \n 17 \nSection 2 also showed key N-related changes in individual plant species because of their plant 18 \nphysiology (e.g. nutrient or water use efficiency; shade tolerance), biomass allocation pattern 19 \n(e.g. root to shoot ratios), and mycorrhizal infection. This can clearly influence the outcome of 20 \nplant species interactions in areas with higher N inputs.  For example, in (tropical) forests 21 \nresponses of plants to light availability certainly mediate the impacts of N deposition between 22 \ncanopy and understorey species, and thus the changes in species composition in this system. 23 \n 24 \nThe other mechanisms, direct toxicity of nitrogen gases and aerosols, long-term negative 25 \neffects of ammonium and ammonia, soil-mediated effects of acidification and secondary stress 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 40\nand disturbance appear more ecosystem specific or at locations near large sources with  high 1 \nair concentrations. They may, however, play a major role in observed species changes in 2 \nspecies composition, the significance of which is dependent on site abiotic characteristics. Acid 3 \nneutralizing capacity (ANC), soil nutrient availability, and soil factors which influence the 4 \nnitrification potential and N immobilization rate, are especially of importance in this respect 5 \n(Bobbink and Lamers 2002).  For example, soil acidification caused by atmospheric deposition 6 \nof S and N compounds is a long-term process that may lead to lower pH, increased leaching of 7 \nbase cations, increased concentrations of toxic metals (e.g. Al) and decrease in nitrification and 8 \naccumulation of litter (Ulrich 1983, 1991).  Finally, acid-resistant plant species will become 9 \ndominant, and species typical of intermediate pH disappear. This interaction between the 10 \nacidifying and eutrophying effects of N deposition is of major importance in exacerbating the 11 \nN deposition effects on species diversity in formerly acidic and weakly calcareous temperate 12 \nhabitats, as grasslands, soft water wetlands or forests, causing a very species-poor and atypical 13 \nvegetation (Stevens et al. 2006). In contrast, in many Mediterranean and arid systems with their 14 \nsoils typically base rich compared to more temperate and boreal systems, acidification effects 15 \nare less important (see Section 2). Furthermore, studies on heathland impacts have shown that 16 \nCalluna vulgaris can respond to increased N availability and that invasion by grasses and 17 \nspecies reduction does not occur until its canopy is opened up by secondary factors such as 18 \nheather beetle attack, frost\/drought damage or fire. These secondary factors may be  highly 19 \ninfluenced by enhanced N inputs in these shrub systems, clearly triggering the shift from dwarf 20 \nshrubs to grasses (Bobbink and Lamers 2002).  However, the impact of N deposition on these 21 \nsecondary factors is hardly quantified for ecosystem types other than heathlands, but can be of 22 \ncrucial importance for the observed changes in vegetation composition.  In addition, increased 23 \navailabiltity of reduced N (ammonium or ammonia) is of major importance for the presence of 24 \ntypical plant species in several ecosystems, where originally nitrate is the dominant form of N 25 \nin stead of ammonium (Bobbink et al. 2003; Kleijn et al. 2008). This effect is especially 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 41\nobserved in areas where most of the N deposition is in the reduced form, and in situations 1 \nwhere nitrification has been hampered by soil acidification, such as occurred in originally 2 \nweakly buffered systems (pH 4.5 \u2013 6.5).  3 \n 4 \n4. Critical loads for N deposition and biodiversity protection  5 \n 6 \nIn the sections 2 and 3, we evaluated impacts on plant diversity and identified, where possible, 7 \nthresholds for N deposition for each major terrestrial ecosystem type  Such thresholds have 8 \nbeen used in evaluation of the need for emission control through the concept of critical loads. 9 \nCritical loads are generally defined as \u201ca quantitative estimate of an exposure to one or more 10 \npollutants below which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements of the 11 \nenvironment do not occur according to present knowledge\u201d (Nilsson and Grennfelt 1988, 12 \nHettelingh et al. 2001, UBA 2004). They are most commonly used in connection with 13 \ndeposition of atmospheric pollutants, particularly acidity and N, and define the maximum 14 \ndeposition flux that an ecosystem is able to sustain in the long-term.  15 \n 16 \nThree approaches are currently used to define critical loads of N. The first, steady-state models, 17 \nuse observations or expert knowledge to determine chemical thresholds (e.g. N availability, N 18 \nleaching, C\/N ratio) in environmental media for effects in different ecosystems, including 19 \nchanges in species composition. Then, steady-state biogeochemical models are used to 20 \ndetermine the deposition rate that results in this threshold value (Spranger et al. 2008).  21 \n 22 \nIn the second approach, empirical critical N loads are set based on field evidence. In Europe, 23 \nempirical critical loads have been used since the early 1990s within the Convention on Long-24 \nRange Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) for impacts on biodiversity in natural and 25 \nsemi-natural systems (Bobbink et al. 1996, Bobbink et al. 2003). Empirical N critical loads are 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 42\nfully based on observed changes in the structure and function of ecosystems, primarily in 1 \nspecies abundance, composition and\/or diversity and are evaluated for specific ecosystems. 2 \nStatistically and biologically significant outcomes of field addition experiments and mesocosm 3 \nstudies have been used to quantify empirical critical loads. Only studies which have 4 \nindependent N treatments of 2 years or more duration have been used. However, since 5 \nexperimental studies have been conducted for a variety of reasons, their design differs, and the 6 \nmethods used are carefully scrutinised to identify factors related to the experimental design or 7 \ndata analysis which may constrain their use. This includes evaluation of the accuracy of the 8 \nestimated values of background N deposition at the experimental site (Sutton et al., 2003). In 9 \naddition, the results from correlative or retrospective field studies have been used, but only as 10 \nadditional evidence to support conclusions from experimental, or as a basis for expert 11 \njudgement. An overview of the European empirical N critical loads is given in Table 2.  12 \nA third approach is based on dynamic models, which are developed for a prognosis of the long-13 \nterm response of ecosystems to deposition, climate, and management scenarios, and can be 14 \nused in an inverse way. The relevance of using this approach is described below. 15 \n 16 \nExceedance of critical N loads 17 \nCritical loads of N can be compared to past, present or future deposition rates in order to 18 \nestablish the amount of excess deposition, also called exceedance. Exceedances of empirical 19 \ncritical loads and those based on steady-state models have been used in European pollution 20 \nabatement policy for defining emission reduction targets (Spranger et al. 2008). However, a 21 \nkey question in their use to support policy development (both in deriving national emission 22 \nceilings and for biodiversity protection through the UN-Convention on Biological Diversity 23 \nand the European Habitats Directive) is whether there is a link between the exceedance of 24 \ncritical N loads and effects on biodiversity, such as species richness. A recent synthesis of 25 \nresults of European N addition experiments in grasslands, wetlands, (sub)Arctic and alpine 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 43\nvegetation, and temperate forests showed a clear negative-log relationship between exceedance 1 \nof empirical N critical loads and plant species richness, expressed as the ratio between the  2 \nplant species richness in the N-added treatment and the control treatment (Fig. 3; Bobbink 3 \n2004). Hence, although there are methodological limitations and scientific uncertainties in the 4 \nmethods used to derive empirical critical loads, exceedance of these values is clearly linked to 5 \nreduced plant species richness in a broad range of European ecosystems.  6 \n 7 \nThe timescale of effects of nitrogen deposition is also a significant limitation of the use of 8 \nexperimental evidence to derive empirical loads due to the limited duration of many studies, 9 \nalthough addition studies clearly longer than 5 years are rather common nowadays. Long-term 10 \nexperiments over 1-2 decades (e.g. Clark and Tilman 2008) suggest that thresholds for 11 \nsignificant effects may be lower with increased duration of treatment. Thus, because of the 12 \nrequirement to base them on evidence of significant effects, the critical loads in Table 2 strictly 13 \nshould only be applied over the duration of the relevant studies (mostly not longer than 20 14 \nyears). More importantly, they may not represent the real biological threshold for cumulative 15 \neffects of N deposition over several decades; indeed for some systems with limited loss of N in 16 \nleaching or denitrification, the threshold deposition may itself not be reached within the studied 17 \ntime period, and the estimate is thus probably too high in those cases.     18 \n 19 \nTherefore, for a prognosis of the long-term response of ecosystems to deposition, climate, and 20 \nmanagement scenarios, an approach based on dynamic models is needed. Recently, integrated 21 \ndynamic soil-vegetation modelling approaches have been developed to assess the impacts of N 22 \ndeposition on plant species diversity for specific ecosystems (de Vries et al., this volume). 23 \nSuch dynamic models have a strong mechanistic basis, and hence can provide a stronger 24 \nscientific basis for policy assessment in the future. They can also be used inversely to quantify 25 \nBobbink et al. \n 44\ncritical load values for different ecosystem types, based on effects on species composition and 1 \nspecies diversity. 2 \n 3 \nHowever, application of each of the  three critical load approaches is presently limited to 4 \necosystems of high conservation value in north, west, and central Europe  for which 5 \nappropriate field and experimental data are available; application in not possible in the 6 \nMediterranean region due to lack of data. As indicated in Section 3, there is data from long-7 \nterm field experiments that could be used to estimate critical loads for some ecosystems in 8 \nNorth America, and there is increasing interest in using this approach across the USA (Burns et 9 \nal. 2008). Tentative thresholds and the risk of negative impacts of increased N inputs for major 10 \nbiomes outside Europe and North America were identified in section 2 and 3 (see Table 1), but 11 \nthere is a lack of data from experiments with realistic N additions and duration to estimate 12 \ncritical loads for these biomes at present (see Table 1 and Technical Annex 1), with the 13 \npossible exception of some Mediterranean systems.  14 \n 15 \n5. Global changes in atmospheric N deposition and ecozones at risk  16 \n 17 \nThe increase in global N emissions in the last 4-5 decades is reflected by an increase in N 18 \ndeposition. This can be illustrated by models that evaluate the transport and deposition of N in 19 \nresponse to past-present and future emissions. In Figure 4 we give the computed total N (NHx 20 \nand NOy) deposition calculated with the TM3 model (Dentener et al. 2006) for 1860 and 2000. 21 \nIn the near future, several scenarios predict that the amounts of N deposition on the various 22 \ncontinents will increase or stay at high levels in the coming decades (Dentener et al. 2006). 23 \n 24 \nIn recent years there have been attempts to assess the risks that N deposition poses to plant 25 \ndiversity around the globe using assessment procedures based to various extents on the critical 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 45\nloads approach (e.g. Bouwman et al. 2002, Phoenix et al. 2006, Dentener et al. 2006) and 1 \nscenario studies considering all major drivers of biodiversity loss (Sala et al. 2000). These 2 \nstudies identify the areas in Europe and parts of North America where N deposition has been 3 \nshown to affect plant diversity in the last 2-3 decades (see Section 2; see also Fig. 4) and 4 \nanticipate that the extent of such impacts around the world will likely increase in coming 5 \ndecades. To estimate the extent that ecosystems of high conservation value around the world 6 \nmay be under threat from increasing N deposition now and in the future we have developed a 7 \nnew approach of overlaying modelled N deposition with WWF G200 ecoregions. Ecoregions 8 \nare defined as: (i) areas containing a distinct assemblage of natural communities and species; 9 \nand (ii) priority conservation areas, which would protect a broad diversity of the earth\u2019s 10 \necosystems. In this way, both hot spots of diversity and regions with their typical ecosystems 11 \nare covered. Importantly, the ecoregions relate to ecosystem types whose response at different 12 \nlocations to N deposition can be compared and contrasted.  13 \nN deposition estimates for the analysis are the mean values for the 23 models used in the multi-14 \nmodel evaluation of Dentener et al. 2006; the mean was consistently the best statistic in the 15 \nstudy when comparison was made with available deposition monitoring.  N deposition 16 \nestimates (in this case for (NO + NO2 + HNO3 + HNO4 + NO3 + 2xN2O5 + PAN + organic 17 \nnitrates) + NHx (NH3 + NH4)) were for a baseline year of 2000 and 2030 driven by three 18 \ndifferent emission scenarios: current legislation (CLE) around the world; maximum feasible 19 \nreduction (MFR) based on available technology and the pessimistic IPCC SRES A2 scenario 20 \n(Dentener et al. 2006).  21 \nAnalysis of the spatial extend of the G200 ecoregions and the mean N deposition in each (Fig. 22 \n5 a,b) shows that in 2000 the ecoregions with the highest N deposition were in Europe, N 23 \nAmerica, southern China and parts of S and SE Asia. However, by 2030, according to the CLE 24 \nand A2 SRES scenarios, large areas in Latin America and Africa, will also be receiving 25 \ndeposition greater than 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1.  Calculation of the  percentage  area of G200 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 46\nterrestrial ecosystems with mean deposition > 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for each of the scenarios shows 1 \nthat for CLE and A2 SRES there is a potential 5 and15 % increase respectively by 2030 2 \ncompared to 2000 (Fig. 6). In addition, the number of ecoregions with N deposition greater 3 \nthan 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1 could potentially increase from 39 (baseline 2000) to  54 (MFR), 62 4 \n(CLE) or 73 (SRES A2) by 2030 (see Technical Annexe II). Importantly, Table 3 shows the 5 \nG200 ecoregions estimated to receive the highest mean and maximum rates of deposition by 6 \n2030 (defined as mean modelled N deposition for CLE 2030 \u2265 15 kg N ha-1 yr-1; where some 7 \nof the ecoregions already have deposition \u2265 15 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in 2000). These include G200 8 \necoregions that correspond to the ecosystem types discussed in Sections 2 and 3 with relatively 9 \nwell characterised sensitivities, such as those in the biomes: montane  grasslands and 10 \nshrublands (includes high altitude montane, subalpine, and alpine grasslands and shrublands), 11 \ntemperate broadleaf and mixed forest, coniferous forest and grasslands, savannas and 12 \nshrublands (see Technical Annexe II). All the ecoregions in these biomes have N deposition 13 \nrates in 2000 and 2030 that are in excess of the thresholds discussed in sections 2 and 3. For 14 \necoregions in the Southwest China temperate forests and mangroves in Bangladesh and India, 15 \nthe mean and maximum N deposition rates are estimated to be very high (> 20 kg N ha-1 yr-1)   16 \nin the baseline year of 2000 (Table 3). 17 \nSome of the tropical ecoregions in Table 3 are estimated to have N deposition > 20 kg N ha-1 18 \nyr-1  in 2000 and in excess of 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in the 2030 scenarios, especially in China and 19 \nIndia (see also Technical Annexe 2). According to the evidence presented in Section 2 and 3 20 \nthese deposition rates may potentially affect plant diversity. Some Mediterranean ecoregions, 21 \nwith modelled deposition 15 < kg N ha-1 yr-1 could also be susceptible to N deposition effects 22 \non plant diversity according to the thresholds discussed in section 2 and 3 (see Technical 23 \nAnnexe I). This tentative risk assessment using the G200 ecoregions clearly shows that 24 \nsignificant areas of valuable ecosystems may already be losing plant diversity and that if 25 \ncurrent atmospheric N deposition trends continue this situation can only get worse. 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 47\n 1 \n6.  Concluding remarks 2 \n  3 \nThis synthesis paper has considered the latest information on the understanding of plant 4 \ndiversity effects of N deposition in terrestrial ecosystems, based upon N-addition studies 5 \naround the globe across a latitudinal sequence. It is clear that temperate and northern 6 \necosystems have undergone significant changes in their plant species composition and diversity 7 \nunder high N loads (Section 2). The mechanisms for N effects described in Section 3 are also 8 \nseen to be in operation in several of the treated ecosystems with the particular sequence of 9 \nevents changing from case to case based on abiotic and biotic conditions of particular 10 \nenvironments. N additions to temperate forests or semi-natural vegetation in high background 11 \nareas (central and western Europe) may fail to show negative impacts on the species richness 12 \nof the vegetation. This could be caused by the fact that these systems have been exposed to 13 \nhigh N inputs for several decades, which has already led to N accumulation, N saturation and 14 \nchanges in the plant composition of the herbaceous layer of vegetation. In ecosystems where 15 \nthe deposition has historically been low, such as in boreal and (sub)Arctic zones, even 16 \nrelatively small (5 -10 kg N ha-1 yr-1) long-term (>5years)  increases in N deposition can result 17 \nin unwanted changes in plant diversity in the near future. It is thus of major importance to 18 \ninvestigate the impacts of N deposition on terrestrial ecosystems in regions before the N 19 \ndeposition starts to increase significantly. Temperate ecosystems outside the UN\/ECE region 20 \nidentified in the G200 analysis, such as temperate forests in China, have no reported studies on 21 \nbiodiversity effects related to the increased N deposition in recent decades, such studies are 22 \nnow essential. 23 \n 24 \nMany of the European Arctic, boreal and temperate ecosystems have already been allocated 25 \neffect thresholds or empirical critical loads under the LRTAP Convention in the UNECE 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 48\nregion. There is a growing urgency to reveal the consequences of actual exceedances of N 1 \ncritical loads in ecosystems of high conservational value with respect to their typical 2 \nbiodiversity, because their biodiversity is one of the main aims for their protection. Dose-3 \nresponse relationships for plant species richness such as shown in Fig. 2 and 3 are thus a 4 \nsignificant step forward and essential to demonstrate that atmospheric N deposition reduction is 5 \nneeded to protect this richness. These results and the modelling studies discussed in the 6 \ncompanion paper (De Vries et al. this volume) are, however, presently difficult to generalize 7 \nacross all biomes outside Europe and North America. Efforts in the near future are required to 8 \nextend evaluations of effect thresholds to low latitude ecosystems which are now or in the 9 \ncoming decades under threats of increasing N deposition (Figs. 4 and 5). In this way, effective 10 \nemission control strategies can be developed for biodiversity control.  However, it is important 11 \nto note that effects of N deposition on biodiversity are mostly only quantified for plant richness 12 \nand diversity, and the impacts on animals and other groups are hardly studied.  This is an 13 \nadditional risk, because food-web based processes may enhance the consequences of N inputs 14 \nfor fauna groups or species. It may therefore be wise to use the lowest part of the effect 15 \nthreshold ranges as a precautionary approach. 16 \n 17 \nThe risk of N deposition impacts on diversity (such as changes in competitive relations, 18 \nsecondary stresses and soil acidification) to lower latitude ecosystem types around the world 19 \n(from Mediterranean to tropical systems) has been less studied, or not at all.. The possible 20 \nimpacts with an indication of their sensitivity are preliminary synthesized in Table 1. 21 \nMediterranean ecosystem studies in N. America revealed the sensitivity of these ecosystems to 22 \nN deposition and these results may be transferable to European and other Mediterranean 23 \nsystems. Ecosystem responses can be similar across comparable Mediterranean ecosystems 24 \nlocated on different continents, but critical loads are likely to be affected by site-specific 25 \nconditions such as N deposition history, forms and quantities; co-occurring pollutants such as 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 49\nozone; climatic and edaphic characteristics; differences in understorey and overstorey 1 \nvegetation sensitivities to added N; the degree of exotic species invasions at the site; and fire, 2 \nland management and land use history.  However, it is likely that several Mediterranean 3 \necosystems will be affected by moderately increased N loads, such as can been found now or in 4 \nnear future in several parts of the Mediterranean ecozones (Fig. 4). The consequences of N 5 \ndeposition in arid zones are rather unclear, although some indications suggest invasions of 6 \nexotic species. However, most arid ecozones are currently, and in near future, in (very) low N 7 \ndeposition regions, and thus at low risk. 8 \n 9 \nTropical forests and savannas have typically been considered as relatively insensitive to N 10 \neffects as many of these systems are limited by phosphorus (P) (e.g. Tanner et al. 1998, 11 \nVitousek et al. this volume) and not by N. Matson et al (1999) argued that most of the 12 \nadditional N inputs to tropical systems will be lost from the system to the water and air, and 13 \nthat the consequences of increased nitrification rates and N losses will be losses of base cations 14 \nand decreases in soil pH, which may in turn lead to decreases in C storage in moist tropical 15 \nforests. However, in terms of plant diversity loss the evidence reviewed in this paper shows 16 \nthat spatial heterogeneity in nutrient availability and within and between species differences in 17 \ntheir ability to access and utilize nutrients when available, may precipitate some of the classic 18 \nmechanism of biodiversity change in response to N addition. Unfortunately, the field 19 \nexperiments in these tropical systems mostly used N addition levels that are quite unrealistic in 20 \nterms of amount and duration of the loads compared with the atmospheric inputs (see 21 \nTechnical Annex II). Gilliam (2006) suggested a hypothesis\u2014the N homogeneity hypothesis\u201422 \npredicting a decline in plant diversity of the understorey of impacted forests as a result of 23 \nexcess N deposition decreasing the naturally high spatial heterogeneity in soil N availability 24 \n(Hutchings et al. 2003, Small & McCarthy 2003) that contributes to the maintenance of high 25 \nspecies diversity of the understorey. The results of N addition studies in temperate forests in 26 \nBobbink et al. \n 50\nthe USA and Europe can be explained by this hypothesis, and very recent evidence in a tropical 1 \nforest study in China (currently unpublished) is also in line with it. Experimental studies 2 \nrepresent a key opportunity in tropical forests and savannas; it is too late to know how many 3 \ntemperate forests functioned in the absence of anthropogenic N, but we can still do prospective 4 \nexperiments in most subtropical, tropical (and southern temperate!) ecoregions before the 5 \natmospheric N loads start to increase in the coming decades in these tropical parts. The 6 \nsummary of N addition experiments across the tropics and subtropics have shown that N 7 \ndeposition may potentially affect plant diversity in some ecosystems more than originally 8 \nthought, and because in some tropical areas (Asia!!) the atmospheric N loads are gradually 9 \nincreasing, research on this topic is now urgently required.. 10 \n 11 \nWe like to finish this synthesis with some concluding statements: 12 \n\u2022 Atmospheric N deposition in temperate and northern Europe and North America is one 13 \nof the major risks to plant diversity degradation. In addition, recovery of N enrichment 14 \nis a very slow process; 15 \n\u2022 It may be later than we think! Biodiversity loss by N deposition could be more serious 16 \nthan first thought in some ecoregions, such as in boreal forests, Mediterranean systems 17 \nand some tropical savannas and montane forests; 18 \n\u2022 A recurrent theme is that plant species respond differentially to nutrient additions and 19 \nthe resultant competition results in shifts in abundance which may be accompanied by 20 \nloss (or increase) of species. This may even be true  in tropical systems, although the 21 \navailable evidence has come from studies with high N additions; 22 \n\u2022 The empirical N critical loads approach is, together with dynamic modelling, a 23 \npromising approach to quantify the sensitivity of global ecosystems for the biodiversity 24 \nBobbink et al. \n 51\nimpacts of N deposition, and, thus, is an useful tool to identify areas where control of N 1 \nemissions are needed; 2 \n\u2022 \u2018More persuasive\u2019 indicators of biodiversity loss in areas with exceeded N critical loads 3 \nare required on a global scale; a first European attempt to quantify the relation between 4 \nN exceedance and plant species richness is promising, but much more data are needed 5 \non other components of biodiversity (fauna, species characteristic of a particular 6 \necosystem type); 7 \n\u2022 Lichens obtain their N requirements from the atmosphere and lichen community 8 \nchanges in response to N deposition functions as an early warning sentinel of 9 \nbiodiversity and other changes caused by N deposition. In many regions with elevated 10 \nN deposition, the critical load for lichen community effects has long been exceeded. 11 \n 12 \nAs usual, many questions remain open about the impacts of N deposition on biodiversity. More 13 \ndata on N deposition to remote regions of the world and its impacts are needed, not only to set 14 \na baseline but also to help provide a database for model validation. It is most important to 15 \nobtain data for regions of the world where N deposition has recently started to increase or is 16 \nexpected to increase in the future. 17 \n 18 \nAcknowledgments 19 \n 20 \nThis paper is based upon an initiative form the first four authors after several discussions on the 21 \nimpacts of N deposition on biodiversity at the Fourth International Nitrogen Conference 22 \n(N2007) in Bahia (Brazil).
