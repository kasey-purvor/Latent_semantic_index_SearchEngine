Covering almost a million square kilometres, it extends \nfrom Gujarat in the southwest, to the Makran Coast in the east and as far north as \n - 2 - \nShortugai in Afghanistan. Whilst Childe and Wheeler interpreted its rapid appearance as \nevidence of a degree of diffusion from the Near East (Childe 1939; Childe 1942; \nWheeler 1953; Childe 1954), these models have since been refuted by the discovery of \nevidence for an incipient urban phase. This phase, termed the Regionalization Era \n(Shaffer 1992:444ff) is now thought to have developed from the region\u2019s pre-pottery \nNeolithic that began in the 7th millennium BC.  \n \n One of the Indus Civilization\u2019s most striking features is its cultural uniformity, \ndespite the fact that it encompasses extremely diverse ecological settings, which vary \nfrom the Cholistan Desert in the east, to the alluvial plains of the Indus and the \nmountainous coast of the Makran. This striking uniformity is provided by a common \nscript, artefact forms and motifs, weights and measures, and the presence of proscribed \nurban plans. The first unit of uniformity, the Indus script, remains undeciphered, but it \nis thought to represent a logo-syllabic script written from left to right. Its known corpus \nof 3700 inscriptions, recovered from sites stretching between southern Asia and the \nPersian Gulf, contains only 170 common simple signs and 170 common composite \nsigns (Parpola 1993). Uniformity is also noted within the size and shape of stone blades, \nbronze tools, stone beads, ceramic forms, and even painted decorations, strongly \nsuggesting a common artefactual standard (Allchin and Allchin 1982:193-202, 221-\n225). Polished stone weights have been discovered throughout the Indus Civilization \nand as far west as the Persian Gulf. All share a single binary system of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \nand up to 12,800 and, although the system of measurement is less certain, the fact that \nthe dimension of both baked and unbaked bricks follow the ratio of 1:2:4 suggests a \nshared or common standard. Finally, there is an apparent common urban plan, as \nillustrated by those of Mohenjo-daro in Sindh and Harappa in the Punjab \u2013 the first two \nIndus sites to be discovered (Childe 1942:135, Wheeler 1959:7ff). They are widely held \nto share a plan of a raised rectangular mud-brick podium in the west (referred to as a \n\u2018citadel\u2019) and a lower but larger mud-brick town in the east (referred to as a \u2018lower \ntown\u2019). This dual pattern has also been identified at a number of other settlements \nthroughout the region such as Surkotada (Joshi 1990) and Kalibangan (Lal 1979). This \nuniformity is quite remarkable in view of the lack of raw resources in the alluvial Indus \nflood plain and the redistribution of raw materials and finished goods across such a vast \narea. Even more remarkable is the fact that this shared collection of attributes appears to \n - 3 - \ndemonstrate little change throughout the Integration Era\u2019s 600-year span. In Wheeler\u2019s \n(1953:108) words: \n \nThe Indus citizens seem to have drawn the penalty of early success: a \ncomplacency, even self-satisfaction, which impeded further effort. Our \u2026 \nknowledge does not suggest any trend towards new social or aesthetic horizons.  \n \n Pioneering scholars, such as Piggott (1950), Wheeler (1953; 1959), and Childe \n(1942; 1954), amongst others, attempted to link the uniformity seen within the \nartefactual record with the notion of social uniformity within the Indus. Moreover, these \nscholars treated social uniformity as synonymous with cultural stagnation and an \nimposed subordination of large swathes of the population (Wheeler 1953:108). These \nOrientalist overviews have dominated normative models of the Indus and have assumed \nthat the caste system was the mechanism for imposing both uniformity and stagnation \n(Piggott 1950:139). Despite the presence of more recent alternative models (Fairservis \n1986; Miller 1985; Rissman 1988) which propose that such uniformity may be a \nconsequence of willing subordination, the pioneers\u2019 projections have remained \ndominant, as demonstrated by Dhavalikar\u2019s interpretations (1995; Dhavalikar et \nal.1996). This article explores the archaeological evidence both for and against the \npresence of subordinated communities within the Indus, and examines models derived \nfrom south Asian cultural traditions and post-processual theory that suggest individuals \nmay have willingly subordinated themselves in order to secure positions of power rather \nthan having been subordinated through caste. \n \n \n \nSUBORDINATED COMMUNITIES \n \nThe earliest excavations of the Indus cities, Mohenjo-daro (Marshall 1931; Mackay \n1938), Harappa (Vats 1940), and Chanhu-daro (Mackay 1943), were primarily \nconcerned with large-scale horizontal excavations and with identifying the cultural \naffiliations of the sites. Although the \u2018Indus\u2019 or \u2018Harappa\u2019 culture was identified as an \nindependent entity, archaeologists naturally looked west to the more famous and \nspectacular cities of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean littoral for their \nanalogies. These archaeologists were mainly Europeans who had been trained at \n - 4 - \nexcavations in the aforementioned areas, and consequently, their interpretations \nconsisted of \u2018kings, urban capitals, slaves, citadels, and alien invasions in the Indus \nValley\u2019 (Fairservis 1986:43), utilizing the imperial frameworks of Near Eastern \narchaeology. Concepts of kingship and slavery remained prevalent within Indus Valley \nstudies for many decades, strengthened by the writings of Childe and Wheeler. The \nconcept of a priestly class ruling over a sprawling empire firmly placed the Indus within \nthe same archaeological category as the Egyptian and Middle Eastern Bronze Age \n\u2018Civilizations\u2019, and the influences of Oriental Despotism (Wittfogel 1957) and the \nAsiatic Mode of Production (Marx 1906) are clear within these early interpretations.   \n \n The concept of subordinated communities within the Indus stems from the \nearliest excavations of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, when Sir John Marshall first \nrecognized the similarities between the two sites (Marshall 1931). These two sites, \nsignificantly larger than any other known site at the time, became the focal points of the \nmajority of socio-political interpretations of the Indus Valley. In their reconstructions of \nIndus society, both Wheeler (Director-General of Archaeology in India 1944\u20131947 and \nlater Archaeological Adviser to the Government of Pakistan) and Piggott (who was \nstationed in India during the Second World War and later became Abercromby Chair in \nPrehistoric Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh 1946\u20131977) identified \nMohenjo-daro and Harappa as the \u2018twin capitals\u2019 of an empire. Wheeler drew attention \nto the methodically planned cities with rectangular blocks dissected by well-drained \nstreets dominated by an acropolis or citadel mound. These citadel mounds were \ncrowned with \u2018ritual\u2019 buildings, including the \u2018State Granary\u2019 at Mohenjo-daro which \nwas the \u2018focal point of the regime\u2019, whilst at Harappa there were supplementary \ngranaries that were \u2018marshalled on the lower ground\u2019 (Wheeler 1959:97). Lothal was \ndescribed as a \u2018regimented coastal township\u2019 (ibid.). Wheeler\u2019s use of terms such as \nstate, regime, marshalled, and regimented presented an image of military or political \ndomination achieved through the use of force, similar in nature to the later Kushan, \nMughal, and Raj empires in south Asia. Piggott (1950:138) envisaged agricultural \noutput being under municipal control through the use of \u2018great granaries strangely \nforeshadowing those of the Roman Army\u2019. \n \n Wheeler\u2019s (1959:97ff) concept of an \u2018Indus Empire\u2019 was dependent on a series \nof interpretations and assumptions made regarding Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Firstly, \n - 5 - \nthat the two cities were rigorously planned, and that this indicated the presence of a \ncentralized governing power that could mobilize labour and impose its concepts of \nurban planning on cities and, secondly, that both cities were separated into a \u2018lower \ntown\u2019 and \u2018citadel\u2019, the latter built on a raised mud-brick platform containing ritual and \npublic buildings such as the \u2018State Granary\u2019 at Mohenjo-daro. Thirdly, that the citadels \nhoused the rulers of the cities, whilst the Lower Town maintained a prosperous middle \nclass. Wheeler identified that both Mohenjo-daro and Harappa were capital cities that \ndominated a partially defined province or domain and were part of the same uniform \ncultural phenomenon. Finally, Wheeler stated that this cultural uniformity is apparent \nand overriding throughout the entirety of the Indus Valley Tradition. Central to \nWheeler\u2019s argument was his assumption that urbanization within the Indus Valley was \nnot an entirely indigenous phenomenon, although he rejected the concept of a full-scale \ncolonization of the region from Mesopotamia. As a result, Wheeler (1959:106) \nsuggested that although the city of Ur evolved naturally from a fourth millennium BC \nvillage to a third millennium BC city, Mohenjo-daro, due to the diffusion of the \u2018urban \nconcept\u2019, was designed with an already fully established concept of civic form. At Kot \nDiji, where there was (at the time of his writing) evidence of a substantial earlier \nsettlement, Wheeler inferred an earlier \u2018failed\u2019 attempt to colonize the river valley. \n \n Piggott (1950:134) developed Wheeler\u2019s concept of imperial hierarchies by \nheavily emphasizing the agrarian character of the Indus Valley Tradition, envisaging a \n\u2018considerable agricultural population producing an adequate surplus beyond its \nimmediate needs for sale to the towns\u2019. He also identified Harappa and Mohenjo-daro as \nnorthern and southern capitals respectively. This idea appears to have been influenced \nby his experience of the British Raj and Mughal Empires in south Asia, where Delhi \nacted as a winter capital and Simla, further north and at a higher altitude, functioned as \nthe summer capital. The uniformity of artefacts and materials within the Indus Valley \nwas explained through a rigidly enforced set of laws, a strongly established commercial \ncode and standardization of manufacturing techniques (Piggott 1950:138). Piggott not \nonly viewed the Indus Valley Tradition as spatially uniform, but also temporally \nuniform. Throughout nine phases of rebuilding at Mohenjo-daro during a 700-year \nperiod Piggott (1950:139ff) identified little change in the material culture of the site \u2013 \nsomething he highlighted as indicative of cultural conservatism and possible cultural \nstagnation. The parallel he drew was not with the Near Eastern communities with which \n - 6 - \nWheeler identified, but Central and South America polities with their \u2018rigorously \nauthoritarian rule and elaborate religious conceptions\u2019 (ibid.:140). Finally, Piggott \ninferred an indigenous origin for the Indus Valley Tradition, albeit with some external \ninfluence as to concepts of urbanization and statehood. He did, however, concede that \nknowledge of this earlier period was minimal.  \n \nPiggott (1950) and Wheeler (Wheeler 1959) both assigned a theocratic nature to the \nsocial structure of the Indus cities. As Piggott (1950:201) put it: \n \nIt is clear that the potent forces behind the organization of the Harappan \nkingdom cannot have been wholly secular, and there is, as we have already seen, \nmore than a hint that the priesthood of some religion played a very important \npart in the regulation of the Harappan economy from within the walls of the \ncitadels of the two capital cities. \n \nThe partnering of the citadels with the Priest-King equated the Indus cities with the \nbetter-known urban centres of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Mediterranean. According \nto Wheeler, although the lower towns of the Indus cities were inhabited by a substantial \nmiddle-class element financed through trade and industry, the primary economy was \nstill agricultural in nature (Wheeler 1953: 84). Excavations at Mohenjo-daro identified a \ngroup of 16 rooms in Block 5 of Section B, HR area, consisting of 12 central rooms \nmeasuring 4x6m with a small internal dividing wall, and four end units measuring \n4x6.7m divided into four rooms. These rooms were divided by a street running north-\nsouth, with an additional lane separating the four end units. A similar series of 15 rooms \nwas identified on the northeastern corner of Mound AB at Harappa, although these were \noriented along an east-west running street. Each unit measured 7.3m wide and 17m deep \nand consisted of two brick-paved cells. The entire complex at Harappa was located on a \nsmall mound, and is associated with 17 circular brick platforms. Piggott (1950:169) \nlikened the rooms to \u2018contemporary coolie-lines\u2019, and subordinate to the nearby \nresidential areas due to their small size. Wheeler (1953:32-34) identified that the \nentranceway to these rooms was through an oblique passage designed to ensure privacy, \nand that they were \u2018a piece of government planning\u2019 and that \u2018it might reflect a servile \nor semi-servile element of the sort familiar in the theocratic administrations of Sumer\u2019. \n - 7 - \nHowever, rather than \u2018coolie-lines\u2019, he suggested that they may alternatively have been \nbarracks or priest\u2019s quarters. \n \n Subsequent scholars have chosen to follow Wheeler. Thus, the Allchins stated \nthat \u2018immediately below the walls of the citadel were two rows of single-roomed \nbarracks, recalling the smallest dwellings in the lower city of Mohenjo-daro and the \nartisans\u2019 or slaves\u2019 quarters in  such sites as Tel-el-Armana in Egypt\u2019 (Allchin and \nAllchin 1982:183). Lal identified a similar complex to the south of Kalibangan\u2019s citadel \nmound, suggesting that as the houses were small and associated with craft-working \ndebris, the area was probably the location of a \u2018colony of manual labourers\u2019 (Lal \n1993:65). More recently, Dhavalikar has identified a further example at Kuntasi in \nGujarat. In this settlement, interpreted by its excavator as a factory fort (Dhavalikar, \nRaval et al. 1996), poorly-built dormitories were identified close to the eastern gate \n\u2018probably for \u2026 artisans who were brought by the Harappans with them\u2019 (ibid.:43ff). \nDhavalikar (1995:172) also suggested that the small shell-working site of Nageshwar \nmay have housed specialized labourers, perhaps even \u2018slave craftsmen\u2019. \n \n \n \nCHILDE AND THE INDUS \n \nAlthough Childe initially presumed a direct link between Mesopotamia and the \nemergence of \"civilization\" within the Indus (1942: 136f), it was not until the fourth \nedition of New Light on the Most Ancient East (published at a similar time to Wheeler \nand Piggott's seminal works) that he questioned the notion of external stimuli as the \ncatalyst for urbanization in the Indus Valley, citing evidence of early occupations and \nurbanization at Kot Diji and Amri (1954: 187). Childe also questioned whether political \nrule was hereditary, as had been traditionally assumed, and proposed the concept of \ncompeting groups vying for political control. This concept of non-hereditary political \nrule pervades the more recent city-state series of models (Possehl 1993; Kenoyer 1994; \nKenoyer 1998).  For Childe (1954:176), the crux of the Indus Valley economy lay in the \nagricultural potential of the alluvial river valley, despite the self-confessed lack of \narchaeological evidence for large-scale agricultural practices or irrigation works. \nHowever, the underlying Marxist credentials of Childe (Trigger 1986:9ff; Trigger 1986: \n - 8 - \n9ff) inevitably led him to adopt an economic principle in terms of social structure. \nWheeler, on the other hand, proposed an authoritarian structure, loosely equating to \ntraditional Edwardian British society. According to Wheeler (1959:84), although the \nlower towns of the Indus Valley cities were inhabited by a substantial middle-class \nelement financed through trade and industry, the primary economy would still have \nbeen agricultural. \n \n However, Childe retained and developed ideas of subordinated communities \ndeveloped by Marshall (1931), in particular the concept of a racial hierarchy. Childe \nstated that the Proto-Australoid element of the population was subservient to the \nSumerian, Eurasian, or Mediterranean population. He also explicitly equated the Proto-\nAustraloid element of Indus society with modern Dravidian populations of south India, \nwhilst the Mediterranean population were immigrants from the west who brought with \nthem the concept of \u2018Civilization\u2019 (Childe 1954:175). Furthermore, Childe (1954) \nlikened the Indus Priest-Kings with the Sumerian \u2018city-god\u2019 and the Egyptian pharaoh, \nwhose power resided in control over the urban granaries and the concentration of \nagricultural wealth. As such, this racial division became not only a social hierarchy, but \nalso an economic one. Childe interpreted this as a form of economic exploitation, as \nopposed to the theocratic dictatorship proposed by Marshall (1931) and reinforced by \nPiggott (1950) and Wheeler (1953). Rather than \u2018coolie-lines\u2019 or servants quarters, \nChilde (1954:175) interpreted the small two-roomed structures of Harappa and \nMohenjo-daro as housing artisans, most likely bonded to the Indus bourgeois who \ninhabited the spacious two-storied houses of the lower town. He also maintained the \ncitadel-lower town divide of rulers and ruled, though he suggests that wealthy \nmerchants and traders from the largest cities supported the ruling king. However, he did \nnot indicate whether this ruling figure would have been hereditary or if there were \ncompeting groups involved in struggles for power. Childe envisaged a society that was \nheavily dependent upon economic co-operation between the various cities within the \nIndus Valley region, and argued that political rule was mostly secular. \n \n Within the archaeological literature, the subordinated communities housed \nwithin the cities are paralleled by the presence of dominant communities on the \nneighbouring citadel mounds. Indeed, Wheeler (1953:34) suggested that \u2018[f]ull in the \npublic eye, and more especially in that of the rulers on the citadel, there was nothing \n - 9 - \nfurtive in the little Harappan cantonment\u2019. The contrast between the well-preserved \nstructures on the summit of Mohenjo-daro\u2019s citadel, with its great bath, college, \ngranary, and pillared hall, and on the other the \u2018subordinated\u2019 complexes, could not \nhave been greater in terms of their extent, height, and degree of monumentality. The \nhypothesized presence of a subordinated element of Indus society appears well \nsupported by the archaeological evidence for differentiated housing blocks within a \nnumber of settlements, and its existence would provide a logical explanation for the \napparent uniformity and timeless nature of artefacts.  \n \n \n \nWILLING SUBORDINATION \n \nThe presence of substantial numbers of hunter-gatherers and pastoralists within the \nIndus system (Possehl and Kennedy 1979; Fairservis 1986) has added unforeseen and \narchaeologically invisible additions to the variables characterizing the social \norganization of the Indus Civilization. It has also been widely noted that the structures \nidentified by Wheeler as granaries at Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, and Lothal are all very \ndifferent and very possibly not granaries at all (Fentress 1976:138). Even the similarity \nbetween the dual plans of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro has been refuted, with Kenoyer \n(1998:55) suggesting that most of Harappa\u2019s mounds were walled, including Mound F \nwhich housed the so-called subordinate communities. The assumption that craft \nactivities would have been located in certain quarters within the cities (Piggott \n1950:170) has also been refuted by detailed surveys carried out at Mohenjo-daro. \nKenoyer, for example, analysed the distribution of shell-working, expecting to find that \nit was concentrated as a large-scale industry in one urban zone under central control \n(Kenoyer 1985). His analysis, however, identified that shell-working was carried out \nthroughout the site and was geared towards a localized market. Similar patterns were \nrecorded for ceramic production, metal-working and even faience-making and steatite-\nworking (Pracchia, Tosi et al. 1985:241), providing a diverse pattern where \u2018the average \nsize of production appears to be restricted, something between the side of a room and a \ncourtyard\u2019 (Coningham 1994:49). Other surprises include the fact that seals and other \n\u2018prestige\u2019 items usually associated with rank, ownership, redistribution, and wealth were \n - 10 - \nfound in lower frequency on the citadel mounds of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro than \nwithin the lower towns (Fentress 1976:241). \n \n Fairservis (1986) developed concepts of decentralization and the lack of state-\nlevel institutions even further by proposing that the Integration Era was organized along \nthe lines of a developed chiefdom. Influenced by the growing number of small sites \n(<1ha) being identified and emerging evidence of short-term occupation of many sites \u2013 \nincluding Mohenjo-daro \u2013 Fairservis (Fairservis 1986; Fairservis 1989) suggested a \nmodel of political organization centred upon cattle herds and pastoralism. Although \nsome archaeologists have incorporated an element of pastoralism into their peripheries \n(Possehl 1993; Kenoyer 1998), Fairservis placed the pastoral communities at the core of \nthe Indus Valley Tradition. The concept that wealth lay outside of the urban centres may \nexplain the contradictions evident in the Indus Valley cities when compared to other \ncontemporary communities. Whilst the absence of clearly dominant communities has \nleft many scholars baffled, several archaeologists have followed Fairservis in rejecting \nnormative concepts of state-level societies. They have identified a number of \nweaknesses in existing interpretations of the Indus Civilization (Miller 1985; Rissman \n1988; Shaffer 1993). These approaches have concentrated upon social dynamics and \nhuman agency in order to explain the social organization of the Indus Civilization, \nstressing concepts of asceticism and the deliberate manipulation of social structures in \norder to mask inequality. Shaffer provided the earliest hint towards an ascetic model of \nsocial organization in a critical review of the position of Indus Valley studies (Shaffer \n1993). Rejecting Piggott\u2019s (1950) concept of a strong centralized governing body, \nShaffer (1993:44ff) suggested that the similarity and homogeneity in style and \nmanufacture reflects the existence of an intensive internal distribution system. \nFurthermore, he suggested that even the smallest sites, such as Allahdino, have yielded \nexamples of almost every known Indus artefact form, even gold, silver, and \nsemiprecious stone.  \n \n As for providing an alternative explanation of Indus Valley socio-political \norganization, Shaffer relied heavily upon the manufacture of metal objects and \nexcavations at Allahdino. He considered metal objects mostly utilitarian in function, a \ndirect contradiction to Mesopotamia where metal objects were considered luxury, status \nitems (Shaffer 1993:46), and the lack of metal objects within graves supported this \n - 11 - \ninterpretation (ibid.:47). However, the distribution and manufacture of objects of metal \nand semiprecious stone were not, in Shaffer\u2019s opinion, without symbolic meaning. \nBecause they represented a conscious effort in terms of manufacturing, the possession \nof such items must have imparted some element of social distinction on the owner(s). \nNevertheless, Shaffer (1993:49) suggested that the inability to identify consistent \ncontextual associations of metal and semiprecious stone objects implies that, unlike \nMesopotamia, these objects were available to a large proportion of Indus Valley society. \nHe suggested that their absence within burials may indicate that: (1) such wealth objects \nwere not hereditary; (2) they were not considered particularly important indicators of \nsocial status; (3) the objects were redistributed at the time of death; (4) there was an \nabsence of well-defined social stratification; or (5) some other cultural rule was at work \ndesignating their presence or absence in burials. This suggestion of non-hereditary \nwealth, and social rules that consciously or unconsciously subvert social structures was \ndeveloped further by Miller (1985) and Rissman (1988) \u2013 although their work has been \nlargely overlooked by Indus archaeologists. \n \n In his paper, Ideology and the Harappan Civilization, Miller (1985:52-56) noted \nthat there was a distinct lack of architectural decoration and that house forms were \nrelatively homogenous. In fact, he identified a lack of evidence for any change in almost \nevery artefactual form for the entire span of the Mature Indus Civilization. Regarding \nthese artefacts, Miller identified that, whilst settlements were engaged in long distance \ntrade for raw materials, the vast majority of artefacts were manufactured locally. The \nlack of imported \u2018prestige items\u2019 lead Miller to postulate that there was some form of \n\u2018embargo upon the importation of foreign manufactures\u2019. These inferences convinced \nMiller that there was no evidence of a class of wealthy individuals \u2013 the ruling \u00e9lites of \nthe normative approaches \u2013 and who have in no way demarcated their distinctiveness \nwithin society. Miller relied on the work of Sarcina, who in her analysis of house sizes \nwithin Mohenjo-daro stated that \u2018the quality of found objects suggest a well-distributed \nwelfare and a comfortable standard of living, devoid of either luxury, on the one hand, \nor evident signs of exploitation on the other\u2019 (Sarcina 1979:185), and that the so-called \n\u2018coolie-lines\u2019 (Piggott 1950:31) were \u2018built with the same care as the larger houses\u2019 \n(Sarcina 1979:186) . Miller saw such homogeneity as a tendency towards formalism, \nwhere artefacts \u2018refer not to groups of people, regions, or other external factors, but only \nto the style, that is, the order within which they were created\u2019 (Miller 1985:59). \n - 12 - \nFurthermore, he envisaged a civilization that \u2018opposes itself at every point to nature\u2019, \nwhere institutionalized principles masked social inequality and the standardization of \nboth artefacts and settlements ensured the reproduction of the formal order that imposed \nthis ideology (ibid.:60). Miller also suggested that \u2018the people of the Harappan who may \nbe said to have power may not have enjoyed privileged wealth or conspicuous \nconsumption, and indeed are more likely to have been conspicuous through asceticism\u2019 \n(ibid.:61). Developing this concept, he suggested that the so-called \u2018barracks\u2019 (Wheeler \n1953) or \u2018coolie-lines\u2019 (Piggott 1950) found within the citadel mounds were more likely \nto have housed monks than slaves. Consequently, a normative tendency towards \nPuritanism was identified as a more likely explanation for the social organization of the \nIndus Civilization, rather than the normative projections of priests and Priest-Kings. \nWithin the apparently timeless nature of the Indus (Piggott 1950), Miller conceived a \nsociety in which an \u2018extreme normative order was valued and combined control over the \nworld. Such an order was antagonistic to anything which threatened it, which meant \nanything not generated by it\u2019 (Miller 1985:63). \n \n Rissman (1988) built on these concepts by examining the apparent correlation \nbetween grave goods and hoards. The impetus for his work was the growing corpus of \nwork in the early 1980s that questioned whether deliberately deposited artefacts reflect \nsocial relations, but rather that there is potential for the manipulation of material culture \nby dominant groups who seek political legitimacy (Hodder 1982; Shanks and Tilley \n1982; Shennan 1982; Miller and Tilley 1984). Integral to Rissman\u2019s methodology was \nBourdieu\u2019s concept that: \n \nthe dominant culture contributes to the real integration of the dominant class; to \nthe fictitious integration of the society as a whole, and hence to the \ndemobilization (false consciousness) of the dominated classes; and to the \nlegitimization of the established order by the establishment of distinctions \n(hierarchies) and the legitimization of these distinctions. The dominant culture \nproduces its function of division under its function of communication. (Bourdieu \n1979:79) \n \nRissman utilized this concept of ideological manipulation in his definitions of grave \ngoods and hoards. The public nature of grave goods, offerings and other displays of \n - 13 - \nwealth can be seen as deliberately misrepresenting social relations in an outright attempt \nto conceal domination, and therefore cannot be utilized as objective indicators of wealth \n(Rissman 1988:209). On the other hand, Rissman believed hoarding to be a private and \nsecular act and the pure opposite of display, and as such, hoards may be considered, \narchaeologically, as more objective indicators of status distinctions. From his analysis \nof hoards from several Indus Valley sites, he concluded \u2018if the Harappan hierarchy of \nsecular value was characterised by some degree of inequality in value distribution, and \nby some degree of rigidity in status distinctions, these qualities were concealed in the \npublic domain by the ideology of value\u2019 (Rissman 1988:219;original italics). \nSignificantly, four of the seven hoards identified at Harappa were located within Mound \nF, the area Piggott (1950) and Wheeler (1953) identified as \u2018coolie-lines\u2019 or \u2018barracks\u2019. \nSuch wealthy deposits would not normally be associated with an apparently \nsubordinated community such as this. However, their presence, along with one of the \nhoards from Mohenjo-daro (which was also found within a traditionally assumed \nsubordinated area), suggests that the inhabitants of these regions had equal, if not \ngreater, access to resources as the remainder of the community. In contrast, only a \nsingle hoard was identified from within the citadels of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, the \npresumed areas of wealth and power (Rissman 1988:218), and their distribution within \nthe lower towns was equally well spaced.  \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION: WILLING OR COERCIVE SUBORDINATION \n \nMiller (1985), Rissman (1988), and Shaffer (1993) all challenged the normative \northodox models of the Indus Civilization, and concluded that the archaeological record \nrepresents a deliberately distorted view of the social structure prevailing at the time. The \ntwo localities widely identified as domiciles of subordinated elements of Indus society, \nMound F at Harappa and Block 5 at Mohenjo-daro, can now be interpreted as housing \nthose with access to supraordinate wealth. Neither Miller nor Rissman has suggested \nthat these \u2018barracks\u2019 housed the rulers of Harappa or Mohenjo-daro, and their role \nremains unclear. It is quite possible that the inhabitants of these architectural units did \nindeed form part of a subordinated community, but perhaps one which willingly \nsubordinated itself. Such a hypothesis is partially framed by Miller who suggested that \n - 14 - \nthe inhabitants of the rooms were more likely to be monks than slaves and that \u2018those \nwho can maintain the greatest distance from ordinary enterprise \u2026 are \u2026 granted an \nauthority and power\u2019 (Miller 1985:61). Indeed, there are numerous examples within the \nhistorical period of south Asia of the power of charismatic individuals who have \nwillingly subordinated themselves by renouncing material wealth and temporal position \n(Tambiah 1976; Tambiah 1984). Such individuals often achieved great influence and \npower through a number of associated characteristics such as harsh ascetic practices \n(Coningham 2001). It is also apparent that the more austere communities became, the \nmore influential they were, as illustrated by the political dominance of the Sri Lankan \nPamsukulka, or \u2018those clothed in rags from dustheaps\u2019 during the eighth to tenth \ncenturies AD (Coningham 1999).  \n \n This is not to suggest that such interpretations are fully supported by the data, \nindeed, Miller\u2019s statement that differential consumption never occurred (Miller \n1985:62) has been challenged by the results of Rissman\u2019s comparison of the relative \nwealth of grave goods and that of hoards. Assuming burials related to a public display \nof wealth he noted that they were associated with a \u2018low secular value of grave goods\u2019 \n(Rissman 1988:217), but that inequality, at least in terms of wealth, was clearly \napparent within private settings in the context of hoards. As such, Rissman\u2019s work can \nbe seen to demonstrate that the archaeological record provides a distorted view of the \nsocial structure of the Indus Civilization, but that this is not due to natural transforms \n(survival rates or excavation techniques), but rather a deliberate attempt by \u00e9lite groups \nto mask any inequality that may have existed. Clearly, such examples strongly \nundermine the normative approach to identifying the social organization of the Indus \nCivilization, as it is quite possible that willingly subordinated communities may have \nbeen responsible for, in the words of Miller, ensuring \u2018the reproduction of order\u2019 (Miller \n1985:64). It may be suggested that while traditional archaeological correlates of rank \nand inequality (Peebles and Kus 1977; Price and Feinman 1995) may identify the \npresence or absence of subordinate communities they are quite inadequate in allowing \nus to identify whether such communities held a dominant position within a society as a \nwhole, or whether their constituent members became subordinated through choice or \ncoercion.   \n \n - 15 - \n In order to fully understand the social and economic organization of the Indus \nCivilization, archaeologists will need to accept and understand the distortion of the \narchaeological record generated by preconceived notions of past societies, which are in \nturn influenced by archaeologists\u2019 own social and political backgrounds. Trigger \nfamously stated that \u2018[w]hilst archaeological discoveries initiated by the Europeans have \nlong encouraged a pride in India's past among its educated \u00e9lite, there is even less \nevidence of nationalism influencing the practice of Indian Archaeology\u2019 (Trigger \n1989:271). Yet, research focused on the Indus Civilization has clearly demonstrated that \nsuch a broad statement about south Asian archaeology is in fact erroneous. Childe\u2019s \n(1954) focus upon the economic exploitation of the populous reflected his own Marxist \nbelief systems, and was published within the context of the post-colonial world in which \nsubordinated communities throughout the world, including south Asia, were gaining \ntheir independence and freedom and accusing their previous colonial rulers of both \neconomic and social imperialism. In many ways, this reflects our own changing \nunderstanding of the Indus Civilization, from its imperial beginnings (i.e. Mackay 1938; \nMarshall 1931) to the postmodern reflections of Miller (1985) and Rissman (1988). \nAlong the way, the Indus Civilization has been the recipient of postcolonial reaction \n(Childe 1954), nationalist impositions of Vedic belief systems (Lal 1993; Talageri 1993; \nRajaram and Frawley 1995), and \u2018New World\u2019 models of chiefdoms (Fairservis 1989). \nHowever, until its script is deciphered, or more rigorous archaeological methodologies \nare adopted, the very nature of the Indus Civilization\u2019s social and economic \ninfrastructure and framework will be unclear, allowing successive generations of \narchaeologists to reflect their own ethnocentric ideals and values upon this silent Bronze \nAge world. \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nALLCHIN, B. and R.
