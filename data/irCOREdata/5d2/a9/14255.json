However, student numbers were found\nnot to be a good indicator of the degree to which CAL is used Furthermore, only two-\nthirds of colleges approached claimed to have received any external funding for CAL and\ndistance learning involved only a small proportion of FE students. Nevertheless, the\ngeneral conclusion drawn is that all FE colleges in Wales use ICTs (information and\ncommunication technologies) extensively, although there are significant differences in\nthe equipment\/student ratios, and there appears to be little strategic college-wide\nplanning concerning such developments.\nIntroduction\nThe increasing usage in recent years of trendy, but often ill-defined, terms such as 'lifelong\nlearning' (see Edwards, Raggatt, Harrison, McCollum and Calder, 1998), 'the learning\nsociety' (for example, National Grid for Learning, http:\/\/www.dfee.gov.uk\/grid\/challenge\/\ngovermhtm), or 'learning country' (for example, Welsh Office, 1998; ETAG, 1999) indicates\nthe importance that both the public and private sectors attach to the establishment of a\nlearning culture. This has included the recognition that, in order to achieve such a culture,\naccess to learning must be made easier and existing barriers removed. Edwards and his co-\nauthors (1998) maintain that most experts see lifelong learning as a rallying cry, rather than\na specific policy. This statement holds true for many similar slogans, but what they have in\ncommon is 'the power to unite various stakeholders around the need for change, because it\nhas emerged as a response to today's challenges' (Edwards et al, 1998).\n12\nALT-\/ Volume 8 Number 3\nStephen Byers, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, emphasized last year that while\nthe first industrial revolution was based on investment in capital and machinery, 'the\nrevolution we are going through now requires investment in human capital - skills,\nlearning and education' (Mansion House speech, 2 February 1999, quoted in Future Unit,\n1999). This revolution has led to a demand for increased flexibility of learning, and in\nparticular a demand for a significant increase in the numbers participating in further\neducation. Digital broadcasting, the Internet and other computerized telecommunications\ntechnologies should have an enormous potential in teaching and learning within post-16\neducation. In particular, they should enable those who in the past missed out on such\neducation, for whatever reason, to take in later life the steps they might have taken earlier\nhad the opportunities been available.\nNowhere is this more poignantly evident than in Wales, with its long-established\nperception of education as the principal means of escaping industrial poverty, but where\ngeographical isolation and a lack of public-transport infrastructure has meant that entire\ncommunities have lacked easy physical access to educational provision beyond secondary\nschool (see for example, the location of communities such as Glyncorrwg, Croeserw and\nCymmer in the Upper Afan Valley). The new flexible learning methods incorporating\ninformation and communications technologies (ICTs) and thus computer-aided learning\n(CAL) would seem to be tailor-made for Wales. For the purposes of this paper, CAL has\nbeen defined as the use of computer-based materials and tools (such as CD-ROMs, the\nInternet, intranets, PowerPoint) in learning and teaching.\nIn many respects, it is the FE sector that should be taking the lead here. Widened access to\nuniversity education is a legitimate and desirable priority, but an approach that aims to\naccess and to widen Wales's educational potential in its entirety is doubtless the one that\nshould be the most vigorously explored. New information technologies allow flexible\naccess to expertise and materials (see Furnell, Evans, Phippen and Abu-Rgheff, 1999);\nfacilitate support for part-time students and for students who are absent for parts of\ncourses; encourage different learning styles (see, for example, Johnston, 1997; Gain and De\nCicco, 1999); there is potentially high audience involvement through interaction (see Jih,\n1996); and they help reduce the problems of high staff-student ratios. In addition, courses\ncan be easily updated or adapted; course material can be personalized (Sargant, 1997);\ninformation is available at all times, both on-site and from isolated locations; and\ninstructors may have a reduced work-load once the material is online. A number of studies\nhave also found that interactive training using computer-aided learning increases retention\n(see, for example, Gunasekaran and Love, 1999); and some authors maintain that learning\ngains through the use of digital multimedia are 56 per cent greater, consistency of learning\n50 to 60 per cent better, learning curves 60 per cent faster and retention 25 to 50 per cent\ngreater (see Burgess, 2000).\nAlthough there is a tendency for some researchers and practitioners alike to disregard\npotential drawbacks of CAL, it is patent that, for a region such as Wales, flexible learning\nincorporating the use of CAL presents constructive and highly functional prospects which\nsimply cannot be ignored, especially by FE with its mission of wide access. However, the\nimplementation and use of CAL is not without (as yet) unsolved problems, such as lack of\ndirect interaction between student and academic staff and\/or other students (Furnell,\nOnions, Bleimann, Gojny, Knahl, Rder and Sanders, 1998), large file sizes for multimedia\n13\nAntje Coder\/\/\/ et al CAL and FE: a Welsh perspective\ndata, leading to long download times; problems of compatibility; serious snags associated\nwith intellectual property rights; hidden problems of staff time (Eisenberg, 1998); costs if\nstudent numbers are not sufficiently high; and security issues (Furnell et al, 1998). In view\nof these problems, Sargant (1997) summarizes the opportunities offered by new\ntechnologies as 'the challenge . . . to harness the most appropriate technology to suit the\nteaching and learning purpose'.\nWelsh FE and ICT initiatives\nIn 1996, the Welsh FE sector was characterized by limited usage of and expertise in CAL\nand ICTs generally, and a distinct lack of integration of its systems (Lockitt, 1999). A\nFurther Education Funding Council for Wales (FEFCW) initiative known as FE-NET was\nlaunched in 1995\/6 to network all FE colleges in Wales and to provide standard connection\nand equipment (FEFCW, 1995). Using the Joint Academic Network (JANET), this gave all\nWelsh FE colleges access to the Internet, as well as an intra-college communication\nchannel. An accompanying project management tool, FE-NET in Action, was developed to\nraise awareness of the potential of ICT networks for learning and teaching in FE.\nRunning parallel with this was the setting up of the QUILT (Quality in Information and\nLearning Technology) Wales project. QUILT Wales, which targeted college-based\ndevelopment programmes, staff training and the design and production of flexible and\nopen learning materials, emerged out of the recommendations of the Higginson Report\n(the report of the English Further Education Funding Council's Learning and Technology\nCommittee - FEFC, 1996), and a joint FFORWM (the Welsh Colleges' Forum) and\nFurther Education Development Agency (FEDA) conference.\nIn 1996, colleges had 64 kbps connections, and following an interim upgrade to 384 kbps in\n1999 (equivalent to ISDN-6), all colleges will have 2 mbps connections by 2001. To the\nuniversity sector, the existing connection, when compared with the very high-speed links\nactually offered by JANET, may seem inordinately slow for use with multimedia data, but\nISDN-6 allows for high-quality audio-graphics, and even video of an acceptable quality\n(Jacobs and Rodgers, 1997; 1998).\nBy 1998, almost all FE colleges had made extensive use of their connections to JANET\nindicating the colleges' readiness to incorporate CAL into the curriculum. The Internet\nwas being used for email, data exchange and searching for information, but with increasing\ndirect use in teaching and learning. Between 1996 and 1999,21 colleges in Wales had been\ninvolved in one or more QUILT college-based projects (FEFCW, 1999).\nStrategic planning to support the infrastructural framework continues with FEFCW com-\nmissioning two recent reports: a video networking and conferencing study (UKERNA,\n1999), and the Becta survey into information and learning technology provision, access\nand policy (Becta, 2000). The major focus of the Becta survey was to assess levels of\ncomputer hardware and ILT (Information and Learning Technology) infrastructures\nwithin the Welsh FE sector.\nGiven such official activity and proposals aimed at increasing both the connectivity of the\nWelsh FE sector and the general use of new technologies for learning and teaching, and\n14\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\ngiven the perceived climate of opportunities for such developments, we conducted a sample\nsurvey intended to establish the extent to which initiatives had so far produced results.\nThe survey\nInitial contact with all FE colleges in Wales was made by telephone. We attempted to\nidentify one person in each college associated with CAL, who was then sent a written\nsurvey. The questionnaire contained ten main questions, some of which included queries\non a range of topics (e.g. use of CAL, involvement of academic staff in the production of\nCAL material, Web-based learning, distance learning, numbers of computers, printers,\nscanners etc., numbers of support staff, availability of equipment to different types of\nstudents). These questions were designed to determine the degree to which CAL was used,\nboth in classes and for unsupervised use; the amount of distance learning carried out by\nthe colleges and the use of CAL for this purpose; the availability of learning materials on\nan intranet or the Internet; the range and quantity of ICT equipment in the FE colleges;\nand the numbers of support staff available.\nThe principal limitation of the methodology was the difficulty in obtaining a full\ncomplement of responses, but twelve valid completed questionnaires were obtained and\nused. The respondents were either senior college officers or managers with responsibilities\nin the area of CAL. Although there might have been some skewing due to the fact that the\nquestionnaires were answered by individuals in a similar position, the authors anticipated\nthat this would also facilitate comparison of the results and help reduce some of the errors\nthat might otherwise arise from different perceptions of staff holding a variety of\npositions. The colleges varied in size: both the smallest and the largest FE colleges in Wales\n(as measured by student numbers) were included, and all areas of Wales were represented.\nResults and discussion\nApproximately a third of colleges claimed to have no central co-ordinator for CAL, since\nthe functions of a CAL co-ordinator are often distributed among a number of individuals\nin Welsh FE colleges (Information and Learning Technology Manager, Flexible Learning\nCentre Manager, Learning Resources Centre Manager or other similar title). For example,\nSystems Resources (CAL learning materials) and curriculum development may have\ndifferent managers, with CAL materials being obtained by, for instance, both the\nLibrary\/Learning Resources Manager and curriculum managers. Indeed, it appears that a\nrecent proliferation of CAL-related projects has increased fragmentation to the point\nwhere, in some colleges, no one individual seems to have a global view of what is\nhappening in this regard, implying that potentially useful experiences are not shared in a\nstructured way.\nWelsh FE is, of course, not alone in such a situation, either with respect to FE colleges in\nother parts of the UK or in post-16 education generally. The origin of CAL in Welsh FE\ncolleges is commonly department-specific, this state of affairs often being historical rather\nthan based on current trends and needs. The results of our survey seem to point to a\nparticularly acute problem in this respect with regard to Welsh FE colleges, which reflects\nthe situation in Wales throughout all education sectors except higher education (which is\nwell served), and public use of ICTs generally. The Spectrum Regional Survey\ncommissioned by the UK government (Spectrum, 1999) into the general use of ICT (which\nis\nAntje Cockrilt et at CAL and FE: a Welsh perspective\nis undoubtedly the most reliable source of data in this area) shows Wales to be well behind\nthe other UK regions, not only in terms of a comparison with the UK average, but also in\nterms of a league table of the twelve regional UK divisions. Wales only marginally betters\nthe bottom region, Northern Ireland, which of course has special problems. One of the\nprincipal reasons given for this situation is the lack of an overarching strategy in Wales.\nOur survey revealed that where a co-ordinator existed in an FE college, the position was\noften attached to some form of division of support or learning service, although in some\ncolleges the job of co-ordinator was located in a specific subject or course division. Others\napparently had no form of organization of CAL whatsoever. The clear implication of this\nis that Wales should follow the lead of the English FEFC: Welsh colleges need to produce -\nand implement - ILT (Information and Learning Technology) Implementation Plans on\nthe lines of those that have been produced and partly implemented in England (FEFC\n1999a; 1999b; 1999c). The FEFCW is preparing for something similar by having\ncommissioned the Becta study referred to above. The recent bulletin entitled Further\nEducation Funding in Wales: 2000-2001 (FEFCW, 2000) stresses that preliminary\noutcomes of the survey indicate a clear need.for funding to be made available for\nupgrading and increasing FE institutions' computer stock and developing local area\nnetworks to meet increasing student demand. A capital resource of \u00a314.812 million (a 48\nper cent increase on the 1999\/2000 quantum) has been allocated to the sector. Of this, \u00a32\nmillion will be distributed to the Video Services Network, \u00a32 million to local area\nnetworks, a further \u00a31 million to ICTs generally, and \u00a3810,000 to JISC (Joint Information\nSystems Committee). A sum of \u00a36.02 million is earmarked for other capital priorities\nincluding improving IT equipment and improving ICT infrastructure to enable the sector\nto play a leading role in the Ufl (University for Industry). However, the impetus is clearly a\ncapital one, and there is little or no evidence of strategic or curriculum drives, which\npresumably are to be left to the colleges themselves.\nThe number of open-access computers in the colleges surveyed ranged from our given\nbracket of 6-25 to in excess of 150. However, there was no significant correlation in the\nratio of numbers of computers and numbers of students. For example, one very small\nresidential college had an open-access PC ratio of 26-75 (our bracket) to 130 full-time\nstudents (FTs). The same number of open-access PCs were reported by a college with 2,000\nFTs, one with 800 FTs and one with 30,000 students (approximately 7,500 FTs) (Welsh\nFunding Councils, 1998). Clearly, some students have much easier access to computers\nthan others.\nSimilarly, no significant relationships were found between the ratio of student and printer\nnumbers or between the ratio of computers and numbers of printers. This tends to indicate\nthat although larger institutions have higher equipment numbers, the student\/equipment\nratio is not determined by college size but rather by internal resource allocation priorities.\nSome of the colleges without a clearly designated CAL co-ordinator had large quantities\nof ICT equipment available on open access, suggesting that there was no relationship\nbetween the presence of a co-ordinator and the level of equipment. This was confirmed by\na two-sample t-test assuming equal variances. The number of technical staff responsible\nfor maintaining\/supporting ICT hardware and software ranged from two in the smallest\ncollege to 20 in one of the medium-sized colleges. The student\/technical staff ratio ranged\n16\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 3\nfrom 65:1 in the smallest college to a massive 1,579:1 in the largest (figures implying here\nthat college size determined by student numbers is not a reliable indicator of the degree to\nwhich modern technology is used).\nAll the colleges surveyed stated that CAL was used in one way or another in teaching or\nlearning, but to varying extents in the different colleges, extending from the majority of\nsubjects to only one subject. Subjects taught using CAL were diverse, ranging from IT,\nelectronics and automechanics to floristry and sports turf maintenance. Somewhat to our\nsurprise, academic staff were involved in writing or producing material for CAL in almost\nall institutions, and in some cases in all departments, but in others were more concentrated\nin subjects such an engineering and IT, even though in certain cases staff in subjects such\nas horticulture and floristry were also involved in this activity. The material was principally\navailable on an intranet, although some was placed on the Internet, all this tending to\nsuggest that FE students are acquiring a substantial degree of computer literacy. It appears\nthat a wide range of delivery media is used, including disks, CD-ROM, an intranet and the\nInternet. However, not unexpectedly given the current move in CAL towards networking,\nthe Internet and an intranet were by far the most commonly used media.\nDespite the seemingly high general level of CAL activity indicated by staff involvement,\nour survey showed that CAL was used only rarely in some institutions, scoring 2 on a scale\nof 1 to 5 (where 1 = never, 5 = at least three times a week). However, in some colleges,\nincluding the smallest, CAL was indeed used at least three times a week on average, both as\nprimary teaching medium and for unsupervised use by students outside contact hours.\nThis situation may well be due to the fact that many full-time students are now required to\nstudy key skills, something which gives rise to major ICT demands, and to the existence in\nmany FE colleges of networked Flexible Learning Centres. Most FE courses generally (not\nonly in the colleges surveyed) now also have ICT requirements relating to student\nassignments, for example a requirement that certain assignments be word-processed.\nThe majority, of FE colleges surveyed did not use proprietary Web-based learning tools\n(seven out of twelve). However, our survey did reveal some use of FirstClass, Blackboard,\nWebCT, Lotus Learning Space, Hot Potatoes, Discovery and certain Web-based tools\nwhich had been developed in-house. On the other hand, three of the colleges not using\nsuch learning tools had not even heard of any of the proprietary facilities available, while a\nfurther three had heard only of WebCT.\nTwo-thirds of the colleges surveyed reported having received external funding for CAL\npurposes, a somewhat disappointing result in the light of so many available initiatives. The\nfunding came from a variety of sources including the BBC, CELTEC, Europe (ADAPT,\nERDF, ESF), FEFCW Training and Consultancy Services (TACS), QUILT, Education for\nIndustry (Efl), and the Welsh Development Agency (WDA). QUILT-funded projects in the\nFE colleges contacted in this study included:\n\u2022 developing multimedia packages to support key skills in communications for\nvocational students;\n\u2022 developing a college-wide intranet;\n\u2022 delivering key skills to geographically isolated modern apprentices;\n\u2022 developing bilingual (English\/Welsh) learning support.\n17\nAntje CoMH et al CAL and FE: a Welsh perspective\nHalf of the colleges surveyed provided at least some distance learning, and among those\nnot currently providing any, one was piloting a scheme, and two others were planning to\nimplement one from September this year. Such a result plainly indicates the growing\nimportance of this type of learning provision, although distance learning at the time of the\nsurvey still involved less than 2 per cent of students in the FE colleges surveyed. The most\ncommon means for students staying in touch with tutors when not on site was email,\nfollowed jointly by telephone and non-email use of the Internet, but in some colleges no\ncommunication was reported outside normal contact hours.\nFinally, it is worth noting that one of the current spending priorities of FE colleges\ngenerally (not only in this survey) appears to be upgrading PCs (a perennial and thorny\nproblem in all educational establishments), improving PC\/student ratios (ditto), and\nnetworking systems. Colleges have also been waiting for FEFCW to make a strategic move\nbefore making investments, a symptom of the rapid development of the new technologies\nas well as an indicator of the lack of an overall clear policy.\nConclusion\nAlthough our survey shows, hardly unexpectedly, that the use of ICTs in Welsh FE colleges\nvaries, their significance is undoubtedly growing. The mere fact that all the colleges\nsurveyed used CAL to some extent indicates the broad shift away from more traditional\nlearning and teaching approaches that has taken place in the last decade. Oxtoby (1999)\nmaintains that 'the future of colleges will be dictated by developments in information and\ncommunications technology. The impact will be enormous . . . in ten or fifteen years' time\nthe student experience will be totally unlike what it is today.' In the current climate, it\nwould be hard to disagree, and our small survey indicates that the shift is indeed taking\nplace. The fact that all colleges were involved in CAL to some extent and, significantly, that\nacademic staff were often involved in the production of the course material is especially\nindicative.\nHowever, much will depend on increased investment in equipment, which will be\nforthcoming only if bodies such as the National Assembly for Wales and the UK\ngovernment turn promises into cash. Our survey has indicated that in some of the colleges\nthe student\/equipment ratios are very poor, something which must undoubtedly have an\nimpact on learning and teaching.\nOur survey has shown that at present there is little in the way of ILT strategy and\nstructured CAL planning in Welsh FE colleges - the fact that designated IT co-ordinators\nwere only to be found in two-thirds of the colleges and that equipment-student ratios vary\nwidely point to this. In England, access to specifically earmarked ILT funding (which\nincludes ICTs and CAL) is available only if a college has an ILT strategy which takes\naccount of ICT issues. In Wales, such funds do not exist, nor are colleges required to have\nan ILT strategy. Consequently, ILT and ICT provision is potentially much less structured\nand funded than in England, and although this may be partially offset in the near future by\nthe availability of European Objective One monies in some areas of Wales, it implies that\nimportant opportunities for widening access to and participation in FE may be missed.\n18\nALT-] Volume 8 Number 3\nNote\n1\n The WALES 2000 Project Research Group is funded by an ESF\/ADAPT grant.
