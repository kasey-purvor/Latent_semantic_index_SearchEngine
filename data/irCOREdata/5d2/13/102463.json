INTRODUCTION \nSeparating codes were introduced in 1969 and \nhave been the  topic of several papers with vari- \nous motivations. Many initial results are due to  \nSagalovich; see [5] for a survey, and also [4, 81. New \napplications of separating codes have appeared dur- \ning the last decade, namely traitor tracing and fin- \ngerprinting. \nFingerprinting is a proposed technique for copy- \nright protection. The vendor has some copyrighted \nwork of which he wants to sell copies t o  customers. \nIf he is not able to  prevent the customer from dupli- \ncating his copy, he may individually mark every copy \nsold with a unique fingerprint. If an illegal copy (for \nwhich the vendor has not been paid) subsequently \nappears, it may be traced back t o  one legal copy and \none pirate via the fingerprint. A pirate is here any \ncustomer guilty of illegal copying of the copyrig:hted \nwork. \nTraitor tracing is the same idea applied to  broad- \ncast encryption keys. E.g. the vendor broadcasts en- \ncrypted pay-TV, and each customer buys or leases a \ndecoder box to  be able to decrypt the programmes. \nIf the vendor is not able t o  make the decoder com- \npletely tamperproof, he may fingerprint the decryp \ntion keys which are stored in the box. \n'Corresponding author \nThe set of fingerprints in use, is called the fin- \ngerprinting code. Separating codes are used in the \nstudy of collusion secure fingerprinting codes. If sev- \neral pirates collude, they posess several copies with \ndifferent fingerprints. By comparing their copies, \nthey will find differences which must be part of the \nfingerprint. These identified 'marks' may be changed \nto produce a false fingerprint. A collusion secure \ncode should aim to identify at least one of the pi- \nrates from this false fingerprint. \nWe shall introduce two useful concepts regarding \ncollusion secure code. If the code is t-frameproof, it \nis impossible for any collusion of at most t pirates \nt o  produce a false fingerprint which is also a valid \nfingerprint of an innocent user. In other words, no \nuser may be framed by a coalition of t pirates or \nless. A t-frameproof code is the same as a (t, 1)- \nseparating code, which will be defined formally in \nthe next section. \nIf t h e  code is t-identifying, the  vendor is always \nable t o  identify at least one pirate from any coali- \ntion of size at most t ,  given a false fingerprint cre- \nated by the coalition. Good t-identifying codes are \nrare, so we are also interested in probabilistic (t, e ) -  \nidentifying codes, where the vendor is able to  iden- \ntify a pirate with probability 1 - 6 for some small \nL. Barg et al. [l] apply (t ,  t)-separating codes to  \nconstruct (t ,  \u20ac)-identifying codes. \n11.

For \nany vector x 6 GF(q)\", we write xi for the i-th \ncomponent, so that  x = ( q , ~ , .  . .  z,). \nConsider a subset C E C. For any position i, we \ndefine t h e  projection e(C) = UaEc{a;}.

If two non-intersecting coalitions can pro- \nduce the same descendant, i.e., if their feasible sets \nintersect, i t  will be impossible t o  trace with certainty \neven one pirate. This motivates the following defi- \nnition. \nDefinition 1 A code C is (t,t\u2019)-separating if, for \nany pair (T,  T\u2018) of disjoint subsets of C where IT1 = \nt and IT\u20181 = t\u2019, the feasible sets are disjoint, i.e. \nF ( T )  n F(T\u2019) = 0. \nSince the separation property is preserved by \ntranslation, we shall always assume that 0 E C. \nThe separation property can be rephrased as follows \nwhen q = 2: For any ordered t + t\u2018-tuple of code- \nwords, there is a coordinate where the t + t\u2018-tuple \n(1..10..0) of weight t o r  its complement occurs. \n111. UPPER BOUNDS ON ( t ,  1) SEPARATING \nCODES \nThe case t\u2019 = 1 corresponds to  \u201cframeproop codes \nintroduced in [2]. KGrner (personal communication) \nhas asimplified proof of R 5 1\/2 for (1,2)-separation \nin the binary case. We generalize it to  any t and q \nas follows. \nPartition {1,2, . .n} into t almost equal parts \nPI,. . . , Pt of size approximately n \/ t .  Say a code- \nword c is unmatched on P; if no other codeword \nprojects onto the same n\/t-tuple on P;. Denote by \nU; the subset of codewords unmatched on Pi. \nLemma 1 If C is (1 ,  t)-separating, then every code- \nword c of C is unmatched on at.least one Pi. \nProof: Otherwise, c could not be separated form \nthe a t  most t codewords matching it on the Pi\u2019s. \nCombining C = UU; with \\U;( 5 qrnlt1, we get \nTheorem 1 If C is (1,t)-sepamting, then IC] 5 \ntqln\/tl.  \nFor constant t ,  this asymptotically gives R I l \/ t .  \nThis is essentially tight, as we now show. \nTo get infinite constructions of separating codes, \nwe need the  following constructive result from Ts- \nfasmann [lo]. \nLemma 2 For any (Y > 0 there is an infinite family \nofq-ary codes with parameters ( N ,  qNR, N 6 )  forN 2 \nN,((Y) and \nR + b  2 1 - (&- 1)-1 - a .  \nTogether with the following easily checked suffi- \ncient condition in terms of minimum distance for a \ncode to be t-separating: \ntd > (t  - l)n, \nthis yields \nT h e o r e m  2 For B e d  t and large enough q, the \nlargest possible rate of a q-ary family oft-sepamting \ncodes satisfy \nR = ( l \/ t ) ( l+ o(1)). \nIv. T H E  GENERAL CASE \nA Sepmtiny Weights \nGiven a ( t ,  t\u2019)-configuration (T, T\u2019) we define the \nseparating set O(T,T\u2019) to  be the set of coordi- \nnate positions where (T,T\u2019) is separated. Let \nB(T, T\u2019) := #O(T, T\u2019) be the separating weight. \nClearly B(T,T\u2019) 2 1 is equivalent with (T,T\u2019) \nbeing separated. The minimum (t, t\u2019)-separating \nweight Bt,ts(C) is the least separating weight of \nany (t,t\u2019)-configuration of C. The minimum s e p  \narating weights have previously been studied by \nSagalovich [5]. Clearly &,l(C) = dl(C). \nB A stronger property in the binary case \nDefinition 2 (Completely Separa t ing  Code) \nA binary code is said to be ( t ,  t\u2019)-completely sepamt- \ning ((t,t\u2019)-CSSJ if for any set ordered set o f t  + t\u2018 \ncodewords, there is at least one column with 1 in the \nt UPJET positions, and 0 elsewhere, and one column \nwith 0 in the t upper positions and 0 in the t\u2019 lower \nones. \nWe define Rss(t, t\u2019) as the largest asymptotical \npossible rate of a family of (t ,  t\u2019)-SS, and similarly \ndefine Rcss(t, t\u2019) for ( t ,  t\u2019)-CSS. We clearly obtain \nthat \n1 \nRss(t , t\u2019)  1 Rcss(t,t\u2018) 2 +(tJ\u2019). (1) \n1291 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Pick \nany vector c from the first ( t  - i)-tuple and replace \nthe code C hy its translation C - c. Thus all the \ncolumns which separates the two tuples havc? the \nform (0.. .01. . .l). \nNow consider any two i-tuples of vectors. Cou- Putting equality in the bounds and solving the \npling each i-tuple with a ( t  - 1)-tuple, we get two equations, we get the upper rate bounds given as \nt-tuples which must be separated on Bt positions, \u2018Bound 1\u2019 in Table 1. Comparing this to  the CSS \ni.e. the two i-tuples must have at least 8t columns of bounds by D\u2019yachkov et al., we see that we get an im- \nthe form (0.. .01. . .1). Now, observe that we can provement from (3,3)-CSS and onwards. However, \nswap the two (t - i)-tuples,\u2019 and the two resulting D\u2019yachkov et al.[9] have a good bound on (2,2)-CSS, \nt-tuples are still separated. This guarantees at least and using that  as a seed for the recursive bounds \n8, columns of the form (1.. . l o . .  .O) .  of our theorems, we get the better bounds given as \nDeleting all the columns where the two (t - i)- \u2018Bound 2\u2019 in the table. \ntuples are not separated, and the words of these two \ntuples must this leave us  with a n  (i,  i)-CSS with sep Example 1 Let C1 be an asymptotic class of \narating weight 8i and parameters (O,-i,M - 2t + (80,2k,81)  (3,3)-SS.
