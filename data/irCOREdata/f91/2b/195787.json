We present a coordinated ground- and space-\nbased multi-instrument study of two magnetospheric sub-\nstorm events that occurred on 1 September 2002, during the\ninterval from 18:00 UT to 24:00 UT. Data from the Clus-\nter and Polar spacecraft are considered in combination with\nground-based magnetometer and HF radar data. During the\nfirst substorm event the Cluster spacecraft, which were in the\nNorthern Hemisphere lobe, are to the west of the main region\naffected by the expansion phase. Nevertheless, substorm sig-\nnatures are seen by Cluster at 18:25 UT (just after the ex-\npansion phase onset as seen on the ground at 18:23 UT), de-\nspite the \u223c5 RE distance of the spacecraft from the plasma\nsheet. The Cluster spacecraft then encounter an earthward-\nmoving diamagnetic cavity at 19:10 UT, having just entered\nthe plasma sheet boundary layer. The second substorm ex-\npansion phase is preceded by pseudobreakups at 22:40 and\n22:56 UT, at which time thinning of the near-Earth, L=6.6,\nplasma sheet occurs. The expansion phase onset at 23:05 UT\nis seen simultaneously in the ground magnetic field, in the\nmagnetotail and at Polar\u2019s near-Earth position. The response\nin the ionospheric flows occurs one minute later. The sec-\nond substorm better fits the near-Earth neutral line model for\nsubstorm onset than the cross-field current instability model.\nKey words. Magnetospheric physics (Magnetosphere-\nionosphere interactions; Magnetic reconnection; Auroral\nphenomenon)\n1 Introduction\nSubstorm onset models have broadly developed into two cat-\negories, the near-Earth neutral line (NENL) model and the\nCorrespondence to: N. C. Draper\n(ncd8@ion.le.ac.uk)\ncross-field current instability (CCI) model. Each consists of\nthree phases; the growth phase (McPherron, 1970), the ex-\npansion phase and the recovery phase (Akasofu, 1964).\nThe NENL model (Baker et al., 1996 and references\ntherein) considers the magnetotail loading that occurs during\nthe growth phase to be a process that cannot be indefinitely\ncontinued; if it were, either the plasma sheet would thin until\nits scale was that of an ion gyroradius, or the dayside magne-\ntopause would be completely eroded through reconnection.\nAs neither of these occur, a NENL forms due to spontaneous\nreconnection in the central plasma sheet at a distance down-\ntail of around 20 to 30 RE from Earth (as suggested by the\nmagnetic reconnection study by Nagai et al., 1998). Initially,\nthe closed magnetic field lines threading the nightside plasma\nsheet are reconnected, followed by reconnection of the open\nfield lines which form the lobes of the tail. Magnetic field\nlines closed during this time are subsequently returned to\nthe dayside. The NENL formation decreases the current in\nthat region of the central plasma sheet. This disturbs the\ncurrent flow, which must be diverted away from this area,\neither earthward, enhancing the inner current sheet, or tail-\nward, leading to plasmoid formation, or it is redirected along\nmagnetic fields that are connected to the ionosphere, creating\nthe substorm current wedge (SCW; McPherron et al., 1973).\nTherefore, in the NENL model, substorms are initiated by the\nspontaneous formation of a magnetic reconnection line in the\nnear-Earth tail, with current disruption in the inner current\nsheet occurring as a result.\nA modified NENL model has also been proposed by Sh-\niokawa et al. (1998), in which high-speed earthward ion flow\nin the current sheet (earthward of the near-Earth neutral line,\nwhich is formed first) is braked in the region where a tail-like\nfield becomes dipolar, resulting in a dawnward inertia current\nat the boundary between the two types of fields. This bound-\nary gradually moves tailward after expansion phase onset as\na result of flux pile-up in the region.\n4218 N. C. Draper et al.: A joint Cluster and ground-based instruments study\nFig. 1. Cluster 1 (Rumba) footprint (solid orange line) and Polar\nfootprint (dashed green line) mapped on to SuperDARN fields-of-\nview, with IMAGE magnetometer stations (black crosses). Times\nof interest are marked with orange crosses for the Cluster footprint\nand green crosses for the Polar footprint.\nIn this picture the substorm current wedge is formed at\nthis braking point. The CCI model (Lui (1996) and refer-\nences therein) considers the high level of magnetic field fluc-\ntuations in the near-Earth current sheet at the start of the ex-\npansion phase (substorm onset). These are attributed, in this\nmodel, to the current disruption and turbulence in the mag-\nnetic field. Current disruption causes the formation of the\nSCW, diverting current flow to the ionosphere. The NENL\nis formed as a result, allowing reconnection and plasmoid\nformation further downtail from the SCW region. The near-\nEarth current sheet disruption can initiate a rarefaction wave\nwhich is propagated downtail (Chao et al., 1977). This leads\nto the thinning of the plasma sheet and tail reconnection.\nTherefore, in the CCI model, the substorm onset is initiated\nat the inner edge of the current sheet and subsequently prop-\nagates both earthward via the SCW and downtail to form the\nNENL.\nIn this paper we present observations in the tail and iono-\nsphere from an interval in which two substorm expansion\nphases occur. From these observations we discuss the rel-\native merits of the two substorm onset models described\nabove.\n2 Instruments\nFigure 1 presents the position of the footprints of the Clus-\nter 1 (Rumba, solid orange line) and Polar spacecraft (dashed\ngreen line) in a geographic coordinate system on 1 Septem-\nber 2002 between 18:00 and 24:00 UT. Also indicated are\nthe fields of view of some of the Northern Hemisphere Su-\nperDARN radars (Greenwald et al., 1995) with beams 2, 8\nand 14 marked for the Hankasalmi (Finland) radar. The lo-\ncations of IMAGE ground magnetometer network stations\n(Viljanen and Ha\u00a8kkinen, 1997) are also indicated in Fig. 1\nas small black crosses. The fields of view of two of the\nSuperDARN radars, located at Hankasalmi in Finland and\nPykkvib\u00e6r in Iceland, partly overlap the IMAGE magne-\ntometer network. The location of the Tixie station of the\n210 MM (210 deg magnetic meridian) magnetometer net-\nwork, whose data is also employed, is out of the view of the\nplot, at 65.67 deg geomagnetic latitude and 196.88 deg geo-\nmagnetic longitude. The times labelled with orange crosses\non the Cluster footprint and green crosses on the Polar foot-\nprint correspond to events discussed in this paper. The Clus-\nter footprint comes into conjunction with the fields of view\nof the radars from around 19:00 UT onwards, starting with\nthe Pykkvib\u00e6r (Iceland East) radar, while the Polar footprint\ncomes into conjunction from 20:00 UT. Figure 2 shows the\nposition of the four Cluster spacecraft (true separations) and\nthe Polar spacecraft during this interval in the GSM xz, xy\nand yz planes. The dotted lines show the model magnetic\nfield lines using the Tsyganenko 1996 model (Tsyganenko\nand Stern, 1996) while the solid lines show the Cluster space-\ncraft paths, and the dashed lines show the Polar spacecraft\u2019s\npath. The Cluster spacecraft are all above the centre of the\nplasma sheet and in the post-midnight sector, and at \u221216\nRE downtail at 18:00 UT (having later moved to \u221218 RE at\n24:00 UT). Cluster 3 (Samba, shown in yellow) is closest to\nthe current sheet, Cluster 4 (Tango, red) is furthest down the\nmagnetotail, and Cluster 2 (Salsa, green) is closest to mid-\nnight (the y=0 axis). The instruments used from the Cluster\nspacecraft in this study include the Fluxgate Magnetometer\n(FGM; Balogh et al., 1997), the Plasma Electron and Cur-\nrent Experiment (PEACE; Johnstone et al., 1997), the Clus-\nter Ion Experiment (CIS; Re`me et al., 1997), and the Re-\nsearch with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors instrument\n(RAPID; Wilken et al., 1997). The Polar spacecraft (denoted\nby a black cross) was in the magnetotail close to the equato-\nrial plane, in the post-midnight sector at a distance of \u22128 RE\ndowntail at 18:00 UT (and later \u22129 RE at 24:00 UT). Parti-\ncle data from the Comprehensive Energetic Particle and Pitch\nAngle Distribution (CEPPAD; Blake et al., 1995) instrument\non Polar are used here.\n3 Data description\n3.1 IMAGE and 210 MM magnetometer arrays\nIn order to provide a context for the Cluster observations and\ndetermine timings for the relevant events occurring during\nthe interval, IMAGE ground magnetometer data are shown\nin Fig. 3. Plots of the x (north-south) component of the mag-\nnetic field at selected IMAGE stations and the correspond-\ning filtered data at one station, Tartu (tar), are shown for the\n18:00 to 24:00 UT interval. The latter provides information\non the presence of Pi2 wave activity. Substorm expansion\nphase onset is accompanied by Pi2 pulsations in the ground\nmagnetometer data, which are irregular, damped ULF waves\nwith a period of approximately 20 to 200 s.\nN. C.

Orientation of the four Cluster spacecraft and the Polar spacecraft during the 1 September 2002 interval (18:00 to 24:00 UT) in\ngeocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) coordinates in the xz, xy and yz planes. Blue represents Cluster 1 (Rumba), green Cluster 2 (Salsa),\nyellow Cluster 3 (Samba) red Cluster 4 (Tango) and a black cross represents the Polar spacecraft. Solid lines show the Cluster spacecraft\npaths and dashed lines show the Polar spacecraft\u2019s path. Dotted lines depict the model magnetic field.\nThe Pi2 pulsations are related to the SCW that forms dur-\ning a magnetospheric substorm (e.g. Lester et al., 1983), and\nthus the onset of Pi2 pulsations may be taken as a proxy for\nsubstorm onset (e.g. Rostoker at al., 1980).\nThe first time of note is 18:23 UT, when Pi2 pulsation on-\nset occurs at all stations, although only one station, tar, is\nshown. This is accompanied by a slight increase in the x-\ncomponent of up to a few tens of nanotesla (nT) at higher\nlatitudes. This indicates either a pseudobreakup or a full sub-\nstorm occurring to the east of the stations. Magnetometer\ndata from the Tixie station of the 210 MM magnetometer\nnetwork are shown in Fig. 4. At 18:23 UT the Tixie station\ndetects a decrease in the H (north\u2013south) component of the\nmagnetic field from \u223c\u2212150 nT to \u223c\u2212250 nT. There is also\na decrease in the D (east-west) component from \u223c510 nT to\n\u223c460 nT. This indicates that a substorm expansion phase on-\nset occurred at 18:23 UT located in this region, rather than a\npseudobreakup.\nAt 22:40 UT and 22:56 UT the IMAGE data (Fig. 3) in-\ndicate pseudobreakups at the lower latitude stations, as ev-\nidenced by Pi2 pulsations in all components but no major\nelectrojet signature at the higher latitudes. At 23:05 UT\nthe full substorm expansion phase onset occurs at the So-\ndankyla\u00a8 (sod) and Pello (pel) stations, shortly followed by\nthe Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (kil) and Ivalo (iva) stations which are at a\nslightly higher latitude (and close to the Polar spacecraft\u2019s\norbit footprint). Pi2 pulsations are detected at all latitudes in\nall components.\n-400\n0\n-400\n0\n-500\n0\n-500\n0\n-500\n0\n-500\n0\n-400\n0\n-400\n0\n-150\n0\n-40\n0\n-20\n0\n0\nX\n (\nn\nT\n)\n-2\n0\n1\nfi\nlt\ne\nre\nd\n X\n (\nn\nT\n)\n18 00 1900 2000 2100 2200 2300 0000\nUT\n1823UT 2240UT 2305UT\nIMAGE Magnetometer Array\n1st September 2002\ntro\nkev\nkil\nlek\niva\nmuo\nsod\npel\nouj\nhan\nnur\ntar\ntar (Pi2)\nFig. 3.

Vertical dashed lines represent\ntimes of pseudobreakup at 22:40 UT and expansion phase onsets at\n18:23 UT and 23:05 UT.\n(Smith et al., 1998) on the Advanced Composition Explorer\n(ACE) spacecraft (Stone et al., 1998), are presented in Fig. 5\n(GSM coordinates). These data have been lagged in order to\ntake into account the time taken by the solar wind to reach\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetopause from where it is measured at the\nACE spacecraft. The lag time for this interval was calcu-\nlated as 75 min, using both magnetic field data from the Mag-\nnetic Fields Measurement (MGF) instrument on the Geotail\nspacecraft (data not shown) and the technique of Khan and\nCowley (1999), from solar wind velocity and density data\nfrom the Solar Wind Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor\n(SWEPAM) instrument (McComas et al., 1998) on ACE.\nIn the discussions of the ACE data we quote all times in\nterms of the lagged time.\nAround the first interval at 18:23 UT the (lagged) Bx com-\nponent of the IMF turns positive. By is negative and approxi-\nmately constant at \u22126 nT, and Bz turns northwards. Btotal re-\nmained steady near 7 nT during this interval. The Bz compo-\nnent of the IMF is southward at around\u22126 nT for at least two\nhours prior to substorm onset at 23:05 UT and remains south-\nward until after 24:00 UT. From 22:15 UT until 23:45 UT the\nBx and By components of the magnetic field remain approxi-\nmately constant and do not change sign, with Bx around 5 nT\nand By around 4 nT. Btotal remains steady near 8 nT during\nthis interval.\n3.3 Hankasalmi and Pykkvib\u00e6r radars\nRange-time-velocity plots for three beams (2, 8, 14) of the\nHankasalmi radar (Finland) are shown in Fig. 6 for the 18:00\nto 24:00 UT interval. The colour scale is such that reds\nand yellows denote flow away from the radar, and blues and\ngreens flow towards the radar; grey is ground scatter.\nN. C.

SuperDARN map potential plots at two-minute intervals\nwith the true vectors superposed at 18:22, 18:24 and 18:26 UT on 1\nSeptember 2002.\nIn the Hankasalmi data, the western beams (e.g. beam 2)\nshow a series of intensifications of Doppler line-of-sight ve-\nlocity (\u2212400 m\/s\u22121 to \u2212800 m\/s\u22121) away from the radar\nsoon after 18:23 UT, beginning at 18:33 UT, while east-\nern beams (e.g. beam 14) show intensification of velocity\ntowards the radar from 18:30 UT (velocities 400 m\/s\u22121 to\n600 m\/s\u22121). These are seen in all beams and are similar to the\nsignatures seen by Sandholt et al. (2002), who related them\nto poleward boundary intensifications (Lyons et al., 1999).\nThe directions of these line-of-sight velocities are consistent\nwith westward ion flow. The direction of flow observed by\nthe radar is subsequently reversed at later times; the change\nin direction occurs at 19:30 UT in the central beams and from\n20:10 UT in the western and eastern beams, indicating that\nthe flows here now become eastward. This is due to the ro-\ntation of the Earth, and hence the radars are under the flows\nrather than an actual change in the flow pattern. The outer\nbeams also show velocity intensifications after 20:10 UT that\nmove equatorward over time; they are highly variable and\nmaintained until 22:40 UT. These are signatures of bursty\nbulk flows (BBFs) in the ionosphere (see Nakamura et al.,\n2004). After 22:40 UT there is a significant reduction in scat-\nter, and from 22:50 UT scatter is lost completely, first from\nthe eastern beams from 22:40 UT and then from the western\nbeams.\nThe Pykkvib\u00e6r radar (Iceland east) data (not shown) have\nintensifications towards the central beams of the radar from\n18:45 UT onwards. Exceptionally strong flows toward the\nradar (600 m\/s\u22121 to 800 m\/s\u22121) are seen in beams 6 to 12\nfrom 19:30 UT onwards. At 22:40 UT there is some inten-\nsification of flow toward the radar on the northern beams 0\nto 7 (velocities 400 m\/s\u22121 to 600 m\/s\u22121). This intensification\npersists until 23:14 UT when it is abruptly lost. After this\ntime much of the scatter is lost such that only ground scatter\nand some low-velocity scatter remains.\n3.4 SuperDARN\nThe map potential analysis technique (Ruohoniemi and\nBaker, 1998) for the SuperDARN data was used to map\nline-of-sight velocity measurements from the Northern\nHemisphere radars (Kodiak, Prince George, King Salmon,\nPykkvib\u00e6r, Hankasalmi, Goose Bay, Saskatoon, Kapuskas-\ning and Stokkseyri) onto a global grid to provide large-scale\n60\u00b0\n70\u00b0 80\u00b0\n-9\n-9 -21\n-9\n-21\n-9\n-2\n1\n-9\n-2\n1\n-9\n-2\n1\n-9\n3\n-2\n1-9\nSUPERDARN PARAMETER PLOT\n1832UT to 1900UT (4-minute intervals; pre-midnight sector)\n1 Sep 2002 (244)\n21 MLT 1836UT 1840UT\n1844UT 1848UT 1852UT\n1856UT 1900UT\nFig. 8.

Cluster FGM data for 1 September 2002 (18:00 to\n24:00 UT interval). The Bx , By , Bz-components and Btotal in GSM\ncoordinates are shown for the Cluster 1 spacecraft (Rumba).\nThe Cluster footprint is shown where it is within the map\nlimits (Figs. 9 and 10 only).\nDotted black lines depict constant latitude and MLT, while\ndashed and solid black lines depict contours of potential. The\ntrue vectors shown are colour-coded by magnitude such that\nslower velocities are blue and faster velocities are red.\nThe map potential plots in Fig. 7 show that at 18:24 UT\n(21 MLT, 60\u25e6 to 80\u25e6 section of plot shown) there is an in-\ntensification of the velocity in the 20 MLT, 65\u25e6 to 70\u25e6 lati-\ntude region, to a velocity of 800 m\/s\u22121. From 18:32 UT until\n19:00 UT (Fig. 8) there are strong westward flows in the pre-\nmidnight sector (21 MLT, 60\u25e6 to 80\u25e6 section of plot shown).\nFigure 9 (00 MLT, 60\u25e6 to 80\u25e6 section of plot shown) shows\nenhancements in flows from 22:40 UT until 22:56 UT in the\nmidnight sector (00 MLT), just equatorward of the estimated\nfootprint of the Cluster spacecraft at that same time. In par-\nticular there are intensifications of the velocity at 22:42 and\n22:52 UT. These intensifications occur at 65\u25e6 to 75\u25e6 latitude,\nand reach values of 1000 m\/s\u22121. From 22:58 UT strong, anti-\nsunward flows continue in the 00 MLT region, as can be seen\nin Fig. 10, centred around 65\u25e6 to 75\u25e6 latitude, to a velocity\nof around 1000 m\/s\u22121 (00 MLT, 60\u25e6 to 80\u25e6 section of plot\nshown). This is maintained until 23:12 UT to a velocity of\n800 m\/s\u22121, after which the scatter is lost. Particularly strong\nflows occur at 23:04 UT.\n3.5 Cluster FGM\nFigure 11 presents the Cluster FGM data for the 18:00 to\n24:00 UT interval for the GSM Bx , By , Bz components and\nBtotal at Cluster 1 (Rumba). In the \u223c20 min prior to the first\nsubstorm expansion phase at 18:23 UT, the field is dominated\nby the x-component, with both y and z components small,\nwith values \u223c1 nT, although we note that the z-component\nis negative. The x-component and hence total field both in-\ncrease up to the time of expansion phase onset. Following\nthe substorm expansion phase onset at 18:23 UT, there is a\nsmall reduction in Bx and Btotal, and Bz changes sign from\nnegative to positive.\nThe field magnitude reduces from \u223c34 nT to \u223c28 nT over\nan interval of \u223c15 min, and is then steady until \u223c19:10 UT.\nThere is then a major reduction in the field, almost to zero\nmagnetic field, which lasts for a few minutes before recover-\ning to a value of 25 nT. After this the magnetic field is highly\nvariable, indicative of the spacecraft being in the plasma\nsheet at this time. From 22:00 UT the magnetic field gener-\nally increases mainly due to an increase in Bx . At 22:40 UT,\nthe time of the first pseudobreakup in the second growth\nphase, there is a small increase in Btotal. At 23:05 UT there\nbegins a reduction in the field magnitude by a factor of two\nover the next hour. After 23:45 UT, the Bx and Bz com-\nponents become comparable in magnitude, \u223c10 nT. There is\nalso a second brief interval when total field approaches 0 nT,\nat 23:53 UT.\nN. C. Draper et al.: A joint Cluster and ground-based instruments study 4223\nFigure 12 shows the Cluster FGM data for four 20-min in-\ntervals which encompass the times of interest: the expansion\nphase onsets at 18:23 and 23:05 UT, the pseudobreakup at\n22:40 UT and a new time of interest, 19:10 UT.\nAgain, data are plotted in GSM for the Bx , By , Bz compo-\nnents and Btotal, and data from the four Cluster spacecraft are\ncolour coded, as indicated on Fig. 12. In the first panel (upper\nleft), the field is approximately constant until 18:21 UT after\nwhich it starts to decrease. From 18:25 UT this decrease is\nquicker and occurs at all spacecraft simultaneously, indicat-\ning a temporal, rather than a spatial, change in the magnetic\nfield at the Cluster spacecraft at that time. There is also evi-\ndence of wave activity initiated at the onset, as Pi2 waves are\npresent from this time.\nAt 19:10 UT (upper right panel) the FGM data show a\nsudden and brief excursion whereby all components briefly\napproach 0 nT, then return to approximately their previous\nvalues. This occurs in the order Cluster 4, then Cluster 1\nand Cluster 2, then finally Cluster 3, and so indicates that the\nspacecraft are encountering a structure in the magnetic field,\nrather than there being some temporal change in the mag-\nnetic fields at that time. The spacecraft exit the structure in\nthe same order as they enter. This indicates that the structure\nmoves completely over the four spacecraft. As the magnetic\nfield is very close to zero, this would indicate that the space-\ncraft are in a diamagnetic cavity. The order in which the\nspacecraft encounter and leave this structure indicates that it\nis coming in from the tail towards the Earth. It is also mov-\ning down on to the spacecraft, in the negative z-direction, as\nthe Cluster 3 spacecraft has the smallest GSM z-value. This\nfeature is the subject of further work (see Draper et al., 2004)\nand will not be discussed in detail in this paper.\nAt 22:40 UT (lower left panel) the FGM data show a peak\nin Bx which decreases from \u223c34 nT at 22:44 UT to \u223c24 nT\nat 22:50 UT, simultaneously at Cluster 1, Cluster 2 and Clus-\nter 4, with Cluster 3 exhibiting broadly similar behaviour\nduring this interval, but not following the other spacecraft as\nexactly. This is perhaps due to Cluster 3 being closer to the\ncurrent sheet than the other three spacecraft. The By com-\nponent also decreases from \u223c15 nT at 22:44 UT to \u223c0 nT at\n22:50 UT.\nHowever, at Cluster 3 the decrease in the By component\nlags that at the other spacecraft by a few minutes.\nAt 23:05 UT (lower right panel) the Bx component of the\nmagnetic field reaches a peak at around 38 nT then decreases\nat all spacecraft simultaneously. Again, Cluster 3 shows\nslightly different variations but in general the agreement be-\ntween the other spacecraft is very close. The By component\nbegins a gradual decrease from \u223c0 nT at this time, while the\nBz component begins a gradual increase in \u223c\u22124 nT. Btotal\nbegins to decrease from\u223c38 nT, following the dominant Bx-\ncomponent, and decreases by a factor of two over the next\nhour. This reduction is seen at all spacecraft and so is a fea-\nture that occurs over the scale size of the spacecraft separa-\ntion. In all components there are fewer high-frequency os-\ncillations during this time, indicating that the spacecraft may\nhave exited the plasma sheet and re-entered the lobe.

Note that the CIS instrument on\nCluster 2 was not operational at the time. Prior to 19:03 UT\n(indicated by the second vertical dashed black line on plot)\nall three spacecraft measure low ion densities of\u223c0.01 cm\u22123.\nAt 19:03 UT there is an increase in the low-energy ion den-\nsities at all spacecraft to \u223c0.1 cm\u22123 at Cluster 1 and Clus-\nter 3, and to \u223c1.0 cm\u22123 at Cluster 4. This is accompa-\nnied by a sharp increase in the vx component of the velocity\nfrom \u223c0 km\/s\u22121 to \u223c1000 km\/s\u22121, with some fluctuations.\nThis indicates bursty flow towards Earth which continues un-\ntil 19:15 UT. At 23:05 UT there is a sharp decrease in the\ndensity at all spacecraft, returning to \u223c0.01 cm\u22123. These\ndata indicate that the spacecraft are in the plasma sheet from\n19:03 UT until the second substorm onset at 23:05 UT, con-\nsistent with the FGM data, and in the lobe before 19:03 UT\nand after 23:05 UT.\n4224 N.

Top six panels: Cluster CIS density and velocity data from\nthe three spacecraft for 1 September 2002 (18:00 to 24:00 UT inter-\nval). Bottom panel: Cluster PEACE density data from Cluster 4 for\nthe same interval.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 13 shows the PEACE electron\ndensity data from Cluster 4 for this interval. Data from this\nspacecraft are shown as the ASPOC (Riedler et al., 1997)\nspacecraft potential control device is switched on in order\nto avoid interference by photoelectrons, thereby making the\ndensity data more reliable. At around 19:03 UT the low-\nenergy electron density at Cluster 4 begins to increase from\n\u223c0.01 cm\u22123 to \u223c0.1 cm\u22123 at 19:10 UT. This higher density\nis maintained until 23:05 UT when there is a sudden decrease\nback to \u223c0.01 cm\u22123. This is also consistent with Cluster be-\ning located in the plasma sheet during this interval. Analysis\nof the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) crossings using\nPEACE data indicates that at 19:03 UT the unit normal of the\nboundary was (0.01, \u22120.56, 0.83) in GSE coordinates, with\nFig. 14.

This was for a\ncrossing from the lobe into the plasma sheet which occurred\nin the direction expected given the orientation of the space-\ncraft. At 23:05 UT the spacecraft re-entered the lobe from\nthe plasma sheet, with a corresponding unit normal of (0.02,\n\u22120.34, \u22120.94) and normal velocity component 38 km\/s\u22121.\nThe RAPID-IES omni-directional electron flux data are\nshown in Fig. 14 (first four panels). The IES shows that the\nflux of electrons in the 40\u2013400 keV range increases by sev-\neral orders of magnitude in the interval 19:03 UT to 23:05 UT\n(with fluctuations). The IIMS data (not shown) indicate that\nthe flux of protons in the 30\u2013100 keV range increases during\nthe same interval. This is also consistent with Cluster being\nin the plasma sheet from 19:03 UT until 23:05 UT.\nFrom 22:40 UT there is a reduced electron flux, suggesting\ngrowth phase effects are now present at the Cluster space-\ncraft. At 23:05 UT there is a sharp decrease at all energy\nlevels at all four spacecraft as they exit the plasma sheet into\nthe lobe.\n3.7 Polar CEPPAD\nTo have an idea of the particle populations closer to Earth\nfor this interval, data from the Polar CEPPAD-IES, which is\nvirtually identical to the RAPID-IES on Cluster, were used.\nThe data are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 14.\nN. C. Draper et al.: A joint Cluster and ground-based instruments study 4225\nPolar at this time is located at 9 RE downtail, in the post-\nmidnight sector. The CEPPAD-IES data show a decrease\nin the electron count rate in the same energy range as the\nRAPID data from 22:40 UT. This drop-out is indicative of the\nplasma sheet thinning and growth phase. This is followed by\na sudden plasma injection at 23:05 UT, indicating expansion\nphase onset.\n3.8 LANL geosynchronous energetic particle data\nThe low energy electron data from the LANL geosyn-\nchronous spacecraft (Fig. 15) indicate that a dispersion-\nless injection of plasma occurs at geosynchronous orbit\n(\u223c6.6 RE) at \u223c18:27 UT. This is detected by two of the\nLANL spacecraft, which at this time are located in the post-\nmidnight sector, close to the geographic equator.\nThis plasma injection into the magnetotail is consis-\ntent with a substorm expansion phase onset occurring at\n18:23 UT. There is also a plasma injection in the midnight\nsector at geosynchronous orbit around the time of the second\nsubstorm at 23:05 UT, also detected by the LANL spacecraft.\n4 Discussion\nA number of events were observed during this interval which\nare seen by many different instruments, both ground-based\nand space-based, which helps to build an accurate picture of\nwhat is happening in both the magnetosphere and ionosphere\nsimultaneously during the two substorm expansion phases\ndescribed above.\nThe first substorm expansion onset occurred at 18:23 UT,\nat which time the Cluster plasma instruments demonstrate\nthat the spacecraft are in the tail lobe. There is a dispersion-\nless plasma injection at 18:27 UT in the post-midnight sec-\ntor of the magnetotail at geosynchronous orbit, detected by\ntwo of the LANL spacecraft, consistent with substorm on-\nset. The magnitude of the onset signature is weak due to the\ndisplacement of the stations from the onset location. This\nis consistent with the few minutes delay between the ground\nmagnetometer signature and the plasma injection at geosyn-\nchronous orbit.\nAlso, a substorm signature is seen at Cluster in the FGM\ndata at 18:25 UT, with a simultaneous reduction in both the\ntotal magnetic field and in Bx at all spacecraft, indicating\na temporal change in the magnetic field. The onset region\nis located to the east of the IMAGE ground magnetometer\nstations, at the location of the Tixie magnetometer station,\nwhere a clear substorm onset signature is detected. We thus\ndefine this as a substorm expansion phase rather than pseu-\ndobreakup. The Cluster spacecraft at this time are located at\n(\u221216,\u22121, 5) RE in GSM coordinates. FGM Bz also changes\nsign from negative to positive at expansion phase onset and\nsince no plasma sheet signature is seen in the plasma data,\nthis is interpreted as a major re-orientation of the lobe field.\nAlthough the Cluster spacecraft are not in the optimum posi-\ntion for the measurement of a substorm onset, the detection\nLos Alamos\nN A T I O N A L L A B O R A T O R Y\nLANL Geosynchronous Electron Data (LoE)\nSeptember  1, 2002 (2002244)\nTavg: 10s\nSp\nin\n-A\nve\nra\nge\nd \nDi\nffe\nre\nnt\nia\nl F\nlu\nx \n    \n ( \n#\/\ncm\n\u00b2\/\ns\/\nsr\n\/k\neV\n )\nLA\nN\nL-\n01\nA\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\nLA\nN\nL-\n02\nA\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\nLA\nN\nL-\n97\nA\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n19\n94\n-0\n8\n4\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n19\n91\n-0\n8\n0\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n18 19 20 21 22 23 24\nUniversal Time ( hours )\n19\n90\n-0\n95\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\nFig. 15. LANL low energy electron data from the SOPA instrument\nare shown for 1 September 2002 (18:00 to 24:00 UT interval).\nof these signatures at onset indicates that this event is a large-\nscale feature. The IMF Bx , By and Bz components fluctuate\nduring this time; in particular, both Bz and Bx turn positive at\n18:23 UT. The northward turning of IMF Bz will decrease the\nrate of dayside reconnection, but wider implications cannot\nbe drawn from this single data set. Due to the substorm ex-\npansion phase onset, the magnetic field in the tail decreases\nfrom 18:23 UT. Hence, the reconnection at the dayside is less\nthan in the magnetotail.\nA brief enhancement of the ionospheric sunward flow near\n70\u25e6 magnetic latitude and 20 MLT accompanies expansion\nphase onset at \u223c18:23 UT but a more significant enhance-\nment of the sunward flow is seen some 5 to 10 min after ex-\npansion phase onset. A series of enhancements at the pole-\nward edge of the scatter at the Hankasalmi radar are seen\nover the next 60 min or so. Such enhancements have been\ndiscussed by Sandholt et al. (2002), who observed 6 dis-\ncrete poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs) of the au-\nroral oval during a substorm event occurring on the 12 De-\ncember 1999. These were identified by an equatorward ex-\npansion of equatorward flow in the late expansion phase us-\ning the Hankasalmi (Finland) SuperDARN radar, as is also\nseen in the late expansion phase of the first substorm after\n18:23 UT. Sandholt and co-workers concluded that bursty\nbulk flows (BBFs) from the magnetic reconnection site may\nbe a phenomena of late substorm expansion phase, resulting\n4226 N. C. Draper et al.: A joint Cluster and ground-based instruments study\nin the auroral and convection events seen at that time, and\nwhich may perhaps account for the flow enhancements seen\nin this particular event.\nWe see no evidence for BBFs in the Cluster data at this\ntime, which is probably due to the Cluster spacecraft being\nin the northern tail lobe. Therefore we are unable to con-\nfirm the interpretation by Sandholt et al. the radar signatures\nfrom this event. We note, however, that the flow enhance-\nments observed by the radars do not have coincident mag-\nnetic signatures which are characteristic of poleward bound-\nary intensifications (Lyons et al., 1999). This suggests that\neither these flow enhancements are not related to PBIs or the\nmagnetic signature is too weak and\/or too localized to be de-\ntected by the IMAGE magnetometers in this case. We also\nnote the lack of lobe signatures associated with the radar flow\nenhancements, unlike the signature in the lobe at expansion\nphase onset.\nAt 19:03 UT the CIS data show that the low-energy ions\nincrease their x-component of velocity (flow towards Earth),\nwhich is maintained until 19:15 UT. This is a signature of ion\nbeams in the PSBL (Eastman et al., 1984), indicating that\nthe Cluster spacecraft cross the PSBL. The low-energy ion\ndensity also increases at 19:03 UT, and is maintained until\n23:05 UT. The PEACE data similarly show an increase in the\ndensity of low-energy electrons from 19:03 UT. The density\nreaches its maximum value at 19:10 UT, and remains there\nuntil 23:05 UT when there is a sudden decrease in density.\nMoreover, the RAPID data show an increase in the number of\nhigh-energy electrons and ions from 19:03 UT, until a sudden\ndecrease at 23:05 UT. RAPID and PEACE data are both con-\nsistent with the Cluster spacecraft entering the plasma sheet\nafter crossing the PSBL and remaining there until 23:05 UT\nwhen they suddenly re-enter the lobe. The unit normal at\nwhich the spacecraft cross the PSBL into the plasma sheet\nat 19:03 UT indicates that it is inclined mainly in the y \u2212 z\nplane, with a negative y-component. The boundary is trav-\nelling at 30 km\/s\u22121 which is slower than typical values (De-\nwhurst et al., 2004).\nPseudobreakups are seen by the IMAGE ground magne-\ntometers at 22:40 and 22:56 UT prior to the second expansion\nphase onset. The IMF as seen at ACE (lagged by 75 min) has\nbeen southward from around 20:55 UT (and remains south-\nwards until after 24:00 UT), and all components have been\napproximately constant from 22:15 UT (and remain so until\naround 23:45 UT). Scatter from the Hankasalmi radar be-\ngins to be lost following the first pseudobreakup, first from\nthe eastern beams and finally from the western beams by\n23:00 UT, after which no further scatter is seen in the Han-\nkasalmi radar data. The Pykkvib\u00e6r radar shows an inten-\nsification of westward flow (toward the radar) at 22:40 UT,\nmaintained until 23:14 UT after which scatter is also lost.\nAt 22:42 UT and 22:52 UT the SuperDARN data show in-\ntensifications in the flow in the midnight sector at 65\u25e6 to\n75\u25e6 latitude and these enhanced flows are associated with\nthe pseudobreakups. The Cluster FGM data show a peak\nin the Bx component of the magnetic field at Cluster 1, 2\nand 4 at 22:40 UT, which decreases simultaneously at all\nspacecraft from 22:44 UT until 22:50 UT. The By component\nalso decreases from 22:44 UT, until 22:50 UT. This feature\nshows some variability in its velocity as it moves towards the\n01 MLT region. Furthermore, Polar CEPPAD data shows a\ndropout in the near-Earth particle populations at \u223c22:40 UT,\nthe time of the first pseudobreakup.\nA full substorm onset occurs at 23:05 UT, as seen at the\nIMAGE magnetometer stations. At this time, Pi2 pulsations\ncommence at all latitudes, in all components of the mag-\nnetic field. The higher latitude stations show a decrease in\nthe Bx component as expected at substorm onset, while the\nlower latitude stations show an increase in the Bx compo-\nnent, indicative of the SCW. Onset is detected at stations\nequatorward of the ionospheric projection of the Polar space-\ncraft\u2019s path first, followed by stations in its path. This im-\nplies that the onset location in the tail was earthward of the\nPolar spacecraft. The Hankasalmi radar has lost much of\nthe ionospheric scatter at this time, but the SuperDARN map\npotential data indicate that there are intensified flows from\n22:58 UT in the 00 MLT, 65\u25e6 to 75\u25e6 latitude region. This is\nmaintained, with some further intensification, until 23:12 UT\nafter which the ionospheric scatter is completely lost in the\nmidnight sector. The strongest flows during this time are\nnow poleward of the location of the flows during pseudo-\nbreakups. The x-component of the magnetic field at all Clus-\nter spacecraft reaches a peak at 23:05 UT, then decreases at\nall spacecraft simultaneously such that over the next hour it\ndecreases by a factor of two. The By component also begins\nto decrease at this time, while the Bz component increases.\nAlso, there are fewer fluctuations in the magnetic field from\n23:05 UT. This is indicative of the dipolarization of the mag-\nnetotail and reduction in field magnitude at the expansion\nphase onset, consistent with the indication from the Cluster\nparticle data that the spacecraft re-enter the lobe at 23:05 UT.\nHowever, the plasma data show no signature for the PSBL\nat 23:05 UT, indicating that either the exit to the lobe oc-\ncurred more rapidly than the entry or there were no flows\nin the PSBL at this time. The near-Earth Polar CEPPAD\ndata also show a plasma injection at 23:05 UT, consistent\nwith substorm onset. The LANL geosynchronous spacecraft\nalso show a plasma injection at this time. The unit normal at\nwhich the Cluster spacecraft cross the PSBL to return to the\nlobe indicates that it is inclined mainly in the y-z plane, with\nboth y and z-components negative. The boundary is travel-\nling at 38 km\/s\u22121 which is faster than the previous entry but\nagain slower than typical values previously found (Dewhurst\net al., 2004).\nIt is interesting to note that the magnetic field in the mag-\nnetotail lobe decreases from 23:05 UT despite that the IMF\nas seen at ACE remains steady and southward. This implies\nthat magnetic flux is being lost from the magnetotail due to\ntail reconnection faster than it is being replaced by reconnec-\ntion at the dayside magnetopause, as in the earlier substorm.\nN. C. Draper et al.: A joint Cluster and ground-based instruments study 4227\n5 Summary and conclusions\nThe first substorm event at 18:23 UT on the ground indicates\nthat the ground-based magnetometers see the substorm event\nfirst, followed by the Cluster spacecraft, two of the geosyn-\nchronous LANL spacecraft and ionospheric radars, respec-\ntively. The Cluster spacecraft at this time are not ideally\nplaced to observe substorm signatures in the tail, being in the\nlobe, and well away from the plasma sheet. Nevertheless, the\nCluster spacecraft detect a substorm signature in the lobe as\ndemonstrated by the FGM data presented above. The loss\nof flux in the lobe occurs at the substorm expansion phase\nonset, indicating that reconnection either began at expansion\nphase onset or had begun somewhat earlier. Reconnection at\nthe dayside is reduced. Furthermore, we estimate that recon-\nnection lasted only for the first 15 min or so of the expansion\nphase, corresponding to the time during which magnetic flux\nin the magnetotail was decreasing. This indicates that the ef-\nfects of the substorm at the location of the Cluster spacecraft,\nin the post-midnight sector of the lobe region of the magne-\ntotail, were of relatively short duration.\nThe second substorm onset at 23:05 UT is seen simulta-\nneously on the ground, in the magnetotail and at the Polar\nspacecraft\u2019s near-Earth position. The response in the iono-\nsphere takes one minute longer to develop than at the space-\ncraft. The implication that reconnection takes place within\nthe Polar orbit at 9 RE downtail needs further study, as this\nvalue is much closer to Earth than the accepted location of\nthe NENL at 20 to 30 RE downtail. The Cluster spacecraft\ncross the PSBL very rapidly, such that the signature in the\nparticle data shows only their exit to the lobe. While in the\nlobe, magnetic flux is again lost, which implies that recon-\nnection is taking place but over a much longer time scale.\nDipolarization takes place at 23:05 UT, which indicates that\nreconnection must be taking place at the NENL at this time.\nThis means that information propagation must be from the\nNENL towards Earth, as there would not be sufficient time\nfor information to be propagated from the inner current sheet\nto the NENL and back again, given the timings presented\nhere. Thus, this event would appear to better fit the NENL\nmodel for substorm onset than the CCI model.\nIn both events enhanced ionospheric flows occur follow-\ning the expansion phase and in the case of the second event\nin association with the pseudobreakup. There is a major dif-\nference between the location of the flows stimulated by the\npseudobreakup and expansion phase in terms of their loca-\ntion, the former located equatorward of the latter. This re-\nquires further study to see if this is repeatable.\nAcknowledgements.
