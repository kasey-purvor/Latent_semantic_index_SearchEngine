INTRODUCTION\nThe understanding of activation processes in nonlinear\nstochastic maps and flows is one of the long-standing prob-\nlems of statistical physics. It attracts much attention in di-\nverse scientific contexts, e.g., in relation to stochastic reso-\nnance \u00031\u0004, directed diffusion in stochastic ratchets \u00032\u20134\u0004,\nnucleation in electrochemical systems \u00035\u0004, the dynamics of\nVCSELs \u00036\u20139\u0004 and gas lasers \u000310,11\u0004, and the passage of\nions through open ionic channels \u000312\u0004 in biological mem-\nbranes. From a mathematical point of view, the interest in\nactivation problems derives in large part from the many\nstimulating topological discoveries that have been made in\nsuch systems \u000313\u201319\u0004.\nThe most promising steps toward a solution have been\nachieved in the regime of small noise intensities. In this\nasymptotic condition, the activation process can be described\nusing a nonequilibrium potential \u0001or equivalently an activa-\ntion energy\u0002. The calculation of the activation energy re-\nquires the minimization of a \u201ccost functional\u201d S\u0001x , t\u0002 along a\nfamily of trajectories and the calculation of an optimal es-\ncape path that the system follows during the activation pro-\ncess with overwhelming probablity in the limit of zero noise\nintensity \u00035,20\u201324\u0004.\nFor a general system, the \u201cpotential\u201d S\u0001x , t\u0002 is a multival-\nued function of position x in the system state space\n\u00034,5,15,20,25\u201334\u0004. Its calculation requires a topological\nanalysis of the action surface \u000319,27,31,35\u0004 and minimization\nover the set of all trajectories emanating from the initial\nsteady state and terminating at x. The trajectory providing\nthe escape from a basin of attraction with least cost is known\nas the most probable escape path \u0001MPEP\u0002 \u000315,22,32\u0004. It is a\nheteroclinic trajectory lying on the intersection of the un-\nstable manifold of the initial state and the stable manifold of\nthe boundary.\nIn general, the structure of the manifolds can be wildly\nsingular and many heteroclinic trajectories may exist. The\nlocation of the MPEP is consequently a very difficult task:\nMany almost degenerate local minima appear in the action,\nand under these conditions the standard methods of minimi-\nzation do not provide a reliable means of extracting the glo-\nbal minimum. The multivaluedness of the potential at the\nboundary makes minimization almost impossible to achieve\nin practice for escape from chaotic attractors \u000336\u0004, or in ac-\ntivation problems for systems where the basin boundaries are\nfractal \u000337,38\u0004, or when the escape rate is enhanced by the\npresence of a chaotic saddle embedded in the basin \u000339\u0004.\nIn this paper we present a method of solving boundary\nvalue problems which significantly simplifies the investiga-\ntion in all of the difficult scenarios mentioned above. The\nsame formalism applies both to maps and to continuous sys-\ntems. It is shown that all the results obtained for a map can\nbe extended to continuous systems by taking the appropriate\nlimit; quite counter-intuitively, however, not all of the results\navailable for continuous systems can be exported to maps.\nWe treat noise-activated escape in two-dimensional systems\nexhibiting unstable cycles, and in two-dimensional meta-\nstable and multistable maps.\nIn Sec. II we outline the Hamiltonian theory of large fluc-\ntuations in maps and introduce the MPEP, cost function, and\nthe nonequilibrium potential or quasipotential. Section III is-\ncusses singularities in the quasipotential including caustics,\ncusp points, and switching lines, taking as an example the\ninverted van der Pol oscillator \u0001IVDP\u0002. A derivation of the\nboundary conditions is presented in Sec. IV. Section V pro-\nvides a linear analysis of the action surface and applies it to\na simple 1D system, taken as an example. The parametriza-\ntion of the family of trajectories is discussed in Sec. VI.\nWhat we will refer to as the action plot is introduced in Sec.\nVII. It represents an easy way to relate the topological prop-\nerties in the phase space to the features of the nonequilibrium\npotential. Its self-similar properties are discussed, and it is\nthen applied in turn to a series of examples: The IVDP, the\nharmonically driven overdamped Duffing oscillator, and the\nHenon and Julia maps. In all cases the theory is tested by\nnumerical simulations. Finally, Sec. VIII summarizes the re-\nsults and draws conclusions.\nII. THEORY\nA stochastic map is a discrete dynamical system with a\nstochastic term. In this paper we consider the very general\ncase of a Markovian system described by a map of the form\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 036131 \u00012005\u0002\n1539-3755\/2005\/72\u00013\u0002\/036131\u000116\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society036131-1\nxn+1 = K\u0001xn\u0002 + \u0001\u0002n. \u00011\u0002\nHere \u0005xn\u0006 a set of coordinates describing the system, K\u0001x\u0002 is\na nonlinear function, and \u0005\u0002n\u0006 is a vector of stochastic vari-\nables mixed by the noise matrix \u0001. The stochastic variables\n\u0002n are assumed to be Gaussianly distributed with\n\u0007\u0002n\b = 0 \u2200 n \u0007\u0002n\u0002m\b = \u0003\u0004nm, \u00012\u0002\nwhere \u0003 is the noise intensity. In the rest of the paper, without\nloss of generality in the results the noise matrix \u0001 is assumed\nto be the identity matrix.\nA continuous system of the form x\u02d9=K\u0001x\u0002+\u0002\u0001t\u0002 can be\nwritten as the limit for h\u21920 of the map xn+1=xn+hK\u0001xn\u0002\n+zn, where the new Gaussian variable zn=\t0h\u0002\u0001t\u0002dt has the\nmomenta \u0007z\b=0 and \u0007z\u0001t\u0002z\u0001s\u0002\b=\u0003h\u0004\u0001t\u2212s\u0002. For this reason, in\nwhat follows, we will focus on the more general case of\nstochastic maps of the form \u00011\u0002 and we will recover the re-\nsults for continuous systems using a limit procedure. The\nfunction K\u0001x\u0002 in Eq. \u00011\u0002 is chosen such that the system dis-\nplays coexisting stable orbits.\nWhen the noise intensity \u0003 is small, the system is ex-\npected to spend most of its time in the vicinity of one of the\nstable states: Only occasionally will it move away from the\nstable state by a distance larger that \n\u0003.\nThe probability of a transition from the initial point xi to a\nfinal point xf with \u000bxf \u2212xi\u000b\u0005\n\u0003 can be expressed as\nP\u0001xf,xi\u0002 = \f\n\u0006\nP\u0003\u0006\u0004d\u0005\u0006\u0006 . \u00013\u0002\nHere the integration is taken along all possible paths \u0006 join-\ning the initial and final states and the functional P\u0003\u0006\u0004 ex-\npresses the probability of the system fluctuating along the\npath \u0006. For a stochastic map of the form \u00011\u0002, and a noise\ndescribed by Eq. \u00012\u0002, the probability P\u0003\u0006\u0004 for a path \u0006\n= \u0005x1\u00afxN\u0006 can be written as\nP\u0003\u0006\u0004 \u0007 exp\r\u2212 S\u0003x1\u00af xN\u0004\n\u0003\n\u000e . \u00014\u0002\nThe function S\u0003x1\u00afxN\u0004 is a cost function defined as\nS\u0003x1\u00af xN\u22121\u0004 = 12 \u000fn=0\nN\u22121\n\u0002n\n2 \u00015\u0002\nwith the constraint between xn and \u0002n expressed by Eq. \u00011\u0002.\nIn the asymptotic limit \u0003\u21920, the transition probability \u00013\u0002\nis dominated by the contribution from the path that mini-\nmizes the cost S\u0003\u0006\u0004. The contributions of other paths to the\nprobability are exponentially suppressed. In other words,\nwhen \u0003\u21920, it is less and less likely that a transition will\noccur, but, on the other hand, when such an event manifests,\nit is exponentially likely to be according to the path that\nminimizes the cost.\nThe probability of the transition takes the asymptotic form\nP\u0001xN\u000bx0\u0002 = z exp\r\u2212 Smin\n\u0003\n\u000e , \u00016\u0002\nwhere Smin is the least cost for the transition. The preexpo-\nnential factor \u0001or prefactor\u0002 gives a correction to the escape\nprobability related to the number of paths close to the path\nwith least cost \u000340\u0004.\nWhen the activation problem is considered explicitly, the\ninitial state xi must be taken in the vicinity of one of the\nstationary states, and the final state xf has to be chosen on the\nboundary of the basin of attraction of the stable structure.\nThe path which realizes the escape with the least cost is\nknown as the most probable escape path \u0001MPEP\u0002. In order to\nsolve the escape problem is necessary to work out the MPEP\nand calculate the cost along it. In this way, the probability of\nescape can be calculated using Eq. \u00016\u0002. The solution will be\nasymptotically correct in the limit \u0003\u21920.\nThe cost function S introduced in Eq. \u00015\u0002 has to be mini-\nmized with respect to the set of all possible noise bursts \u0005\u0002n\u0006\nand to the set of all possible intermediate coordinates \u0005xn\u0006. It\nis clear that Eq. \u00011\u0002 gives a constraint between the values of\n\u0005xn\u0006 and \u0005\u0002n\u0006. The constraint is taken into account by per-\nforming the minimization using the method of Lagrange un-\ndetermined multipliers. The auxiliary cost function\nS\u02dc =\n1\n2\u000fn\nN\n\u0002n\n2 + \bn\u0003xn+1 \u2212 K\u0001xn\u0002 \u2212 \u0002n\u0004 \u00017\u0002\nis introduced, where \u0005\bi\u0006 is a set of Lagrangian multipliers.\nThe auxiliary function S\u02dc must be minimized with respect to\n\u0002i,xi,\bi as independent variables. The following relationships\nare obtained from the minimization:\nxn+1 = K\u0001xn\u0002 + \bn,\n\bn+1 = \r\u0010 \u0001K\u0001xi\u0010xn+1\u000e\n\u22121\n\bn. \u00018\u0002\nEquations \u00018\u0002 define an extended area-preserving map. The\ncost function can be considered as evolving along the trajec-\ntories according to\nSn+1 = Sn +\n1\n2\n\bn\n2\n. \u00019\u0002\nThe calculation of the transition probability can be now per-\nformed using Eq. \u00018\u0002 to calculate the evolution of the system,\ncombined with Eq. \u00019\u0002.\nFor a continuous system, the limit h\u21920 gives\nx\u02d9 = K\u0001x\u0002 + \b , \u000110\u0002\n\b\u02d9 = \u2212 \r \u0001K\n\u0001x\n\u000e\b . \u000111\u0002\nEquations \u000110\u0002 and \u000111\u0002 can be seen as a set of equations\ndescribing an auxiliary Hamiltonian system. The Lagrange\nmultiplier \b plays the role of a momentum p conjugate to the\ncoordinate x. The Hamiltonian for this system is known as\nthe Wentzell-Freidlin Hamiltonian\nH\u0001x,\b\u0002 =\n1\n2\n\b2 + \bK . \u000112\u0002\nConsidering the formal Hamiltonian structure of Eqs. \u000110\u0002\nand \u000111\u0002, when discussing continuous systems, we will refer\nBERI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 036131 \u00012005\u0002\n036131-2\nto the Lagrangian multipliers as momenta and we will use\nthe notation \b or p independently.\nThe equation for the evolution of the cost function along\nEqs. \u000110\u0002 and \u000111\u0002 is Si+1=Si+\n1\n2h\bi\n2; in the limit h\u21920 it\nreads as\nS\u02d9 =\n1\n2\n\b2 =\n\u0001H\n\u0001\b\n\b \u2212 H . \u000113\u0002\nS evolves according to the equation for a classical action in\nthe system described by the Hamiltonian \u000112\u0002. Hamiltonian\nsystems \u000110\u0002 and \u000111\u0002, Hamiltonian \u000112\u0002, and Eq. \u000113\u0002 for the\ncost function, can all be obtained in an alternative way\nthrough asymptotic analysis of the Fokker-Planck equation\n\u000319,41\u0004.\nGenerally, there are infinitely many solutions of Eqs. \u00018\u0002\nwhich emanates from the initial state x0 and reach the final\nstate xN; each of them having a corresponding cost. They\ncorrespond to local minima of the cost function; however, in\nthe limit of small noise intensity, the probability density for\nthe system is dominated by the global minimum of the ac-\ntion, because the contributions of the other local minima be-\ncome exponentially small. This property has been confirmed\nby analog experiments \u000342,43\u0004: The ensemble average of a\nlarge number of trajectories from an initial stationary point to\na final one is found to be consistent with the least cost tra-\njectory, and not with other local minima. In other words,\nonly those trajectories corresponding to a global minimum\ncan be observed in a physical experiment in the zero noise-\nintensity limit. For this reason, these trajectories are called\nphysical and the ones corresponding to local minima un-\nphysical \u000318\u0004.\nThe probability distribution is then defined by the mini-\nmum value of the cost Smin\u0001x\u0002=min\u0005Sm\u0001x\u0002\u0006, where Sm are the\ncosts calculated along different trajectories terminating in x.\nAll the functions Sm are smooth, but the procedure of mini-\nmization might produce nondifferentiability in Smin\n\u000325,26,28\u0004. For nonequilibrium systems Smin is continuous,\nbut it is not everywhere differentiable. The nondifferentiabil-\nity of the cost function is a generic feature of nonequilibrium\nsystems and has been intensively investigated\n\u00031,18,25,26,28\u0004. Although not differentiable everywhere,\nnevertheless the function Smin cannot be arbitrarily irregular.\nFirst, S is nondecreasing along the trajectories of Eq. \u00018\u0002.\nSecond \u000344\u0004, Smin is locally a Lipschitz function; i.e., for\nevery point x0 in the coordinate space, a neighborhood of x0\nexists such that for any pair of points x1 and x2\n\u000bSmin\u0001x1\u0002 \u2212 Smin\u0001x2\u0002\u000b\t L\u000bx1 \u2212 x2\u000b , \u000114\u0002\nwhere L is a finite constant. The local Lipschitz condition is\nenough to imply differentiability almost everywhere \u000328\u0004.\nIt is known from the theory of nondifferentiable\nLyapunov functions that, if Smin is nondecreasing along the\ntrajectories of Eq. \u00018\u0002 and it is locally a Lipschitz function,\nthen all theorems valid in the differentiable case can be gen-\neralized \u000328\u0004. This allows the use of Smin as a nonequilibrium\npotential \u0001or quasipotential\u0002 for the system.\nIII. TOPOLOGY\nThe presence of singularities in the quasipotential Smin is\nrelated to the presence of singular features in the pattern of\nsolutions of Eq. \u00018\u0002 or Eqs. \u000110\u0002 and \u000111\u0002. They provide one\nof the main difficulties in the solution of the boundary values\nproblem.\nWe consider the case of a continuous planar system pre-\nsenting a saddle cycle Sc coexisting with a stable equilibrium\npoint x0. The escape problem is formulated by setting the\nfollowing boundary value conditions:\nlim\nt\u2192\u2212\n\nx = x0 lim\nt\u2192+\n\nx = Sc \u000115\u0002\nThe picture for a two-dimensional map is similar.\nIt is known from the theory of dynamical systems \u000345\u0004\nthat the trajectories providing solutions of Eq. \u000111\u0002 emanat-\ning from x0 for t\u2192\u2212\n span a two-dimensional Lagrangian\nunstable manifold \u0001UM\u0002 in the four-dimensional phase space.\nThe projections of these trajectories onto the coordinate\nspace determine the pattern of escape trajectories. If we fol-\nlow the motion of these trajectories, we expect three different\nbehaviors, as summarized in Fig. 1, where the behavior of\nescape trajectories is shown for an inverted van der Pol\n\u0001IVDP\u0002 system. It is an example of an autonomous system\nwith a stable point coexisting with a saddle cycle described\nby the following equation:\nx\u00a8 + 2\u000b\u00011 \u2212 x2\u0002x\u02d9 + x = 0, \u000116\u0002\nwhere x is a dynamical variable and \u000b\u00050 is real coefficient.\nIn the coordinate space x ,y= x\u02d9, the noise drives the system\nfrom the stable point \u00010,0\u0002 toward the saddle cycle according\nto the solutions of Eqs. \u000110\u0002 and \u000111\u0002. Some of the trajecto-\nries cross the cycle and continue their fluctuational motion\nindefinitely. Some other trajectories have insufficient mo-\nFIG. 1.

The MPEP is shown as\na thick line. It reaches the limit cycle asymptotically with no mo-\nmentum. Some trajectories that are small perturbations of the MPEP\nare also shown \u0001thin lines\u0002. They may either cross the cycle or be\nreflected, moving back to the initial state. The MPEP separates\nthese two families of trajectories.\nSOLUTION OF THE BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM FOR\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 036131 \u00012005\u0002\n036131-3\nmentum p\u0001 to overcome the repelling force of the cycle and\nthey are reflected back toward the initial stable state. A par-\nticular trajectory separates the two families: It reaches the\nsaddle cycle asymptotically \u0001for t\u2192\n\u0002 and tangentially \u0001p\n\u21920 for t\u21920\u0002. In the extended phase space, such a trajectory\nlies on the intersection of the unstable manifold on the initial\nstate and the stable manifold of the final cycle. The correct\nmathematical definition for a path having such a property is\na heteroclinic trajectory.\nIt is classical result of the asymptotic theory of activation\n\u000315\u201317,19,26,31\u0004 that the most probable escape path must be\na heteroclinic trajectory.\nIn a nonequilibrium system with saddles, the structure of\nboth manifolds and patterns of trajectories can be singular\n\u000313,15,17,19\u0004. The trajectories solution of Eq. \u000111\u0002 may\npresent multiple intersections in the coordinate space, and\nthe pattern presents singular features such as caustics and\ncusp points. Caustics appear in the pattern as envelopes of\ntrajectories; the cusps correspond to the merging of two\nseparate branches of a caustic. A caustic can be generated by\na family of trajectories during their motion toward the saddle\n\u0001where \b is substantially different from zero\u0002 or by trajecto-\nries which are relaxing back toward the stable state \u0001where \b\nis near zero\u0002. Since the momentum of a trajectory becomes\nexponentially small as it approaches the saddle, the closer a\ntrajectory gets to the limit cycle before being reflected, the\nmore it resembles a purely relaxational trajectory during its\nmotion toward the initial state and the contact with the caus-\ntics takes place far inside the cycle. For this reason, the in-\nternal branch of the caustic always converges to the initial\nstate.\nIn the region included by caustics, the escaping trajecto-\nries intersect those trajectories that are reflected back. Such\napparent intersection results from projection onto the coordi-\nnate space, as the Cauchy theorem does not allow the trajec-\ntories to cross in the extended phase space and the \u201ccrossing\u201d\npaths must have different values of momenta. In these re-\ngions, the Lagrangian manifold is threefold. What appears to\nbe an intersection occurs between trajectories on different\nsheets of the manifold. A trajectory starts on one of the two\nexternal leaves of the fold. Then it eventually moves to the\ncentral leaf. In the projection, the leaf swap appears as a\nreflection by a caustic \u000317,19\u0004. Once a trajectory is on the\ncentral leaf of the manifold, it stays there forever, because\nany further contact with the caustics is forbidden by the\nCauchy theorem. Following contact with a caustic, the dy-\nnamics of a trajectory continue on the central leaf of the\nmanifold, and each of the trajectories on the central leaf may\npresent the same behavior as the trajectories on the external\nleaves. In particular, heteroclinic trajectories other than the\nMPEP are present on the central leaf. Considering the pattern\nof trajectories on the central leaf of the manifold, it may\npresent intersections similar to those observed for the full\npattern. This means that the central sheet is folding again\ngenerating new caustics and cusps. This pictures repeats\nagain and again in a self similar way.\nIn the region where different trajectories intersect, the ac-\ntion is multivalued. In the limit \u0003\u21920, only the trajectories\nreaching a point x with least action can be observed experi-\nmentally. A continuous line separates the regions where the\nphysical trajectories are qualitatively different. Such a line is\ncalled the switching line \u0001SL\u0002 \u000317,19\u0004. Each point on the SL\nis reached by two different trajectories having exactly the\nsame action. In the example of the IVDP, the SL separates\nthe region where the physical trajectories have a momentum\n\b significantly different from zero from the regions where\nthe physical trajectories are relaxing back toward the internal\npart of the cycle \u0001having \b\u00110\u0002. On the action surface, the\nswitching line corresponds to the intersection \u0001at a nonzero\nangle\u0002 of two sheets of the action surface. Cutting off the\nnonphysical parts of the action surface \u0001i.e., those with non-\nminimum action\u0002, corresponding to the switching lines, we\nobserve a nondifferentiability of the surface: The action is\ncontinuous on the SL, but the first derivative in the orthogo-\nnal direction switches abruptly between two different finite\nvalues.\nIV. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\nIn the previous sections, the complex, self-repeating, sin-\ngular structure of the manifold has been illustrated. All these\nare global properties, related to the nonlinear form of K\u0001x\u0002\nand to the lack of detailed balance in the system. In order to\nset the boundary conditions properly, however, the shape of\nthe manifold in the vicinity of the stationary states must be\nknown.\nIn this section, we investigate the topology of the La-\ngrangian manifolds in the vicinity of stationary points, for\nboth maps and continuous systems, using linear analysis. We\nstart from the simple case of a period-one stationary orbit xs\nfor a two-dimensional map. In the close vicinity of xs, the\nextended map \u00018\u0002 is rewritten as\n\u0004xn+1 = A\u0004xn + \bn,\n\u000117\u0002\n\bn+1 = A\u22121T\bn,\nwhere \u0004x is the displacement from xs and A is the Jacobian\nmatrix of the original map calculated in xs. The point \u0004x=0;\n\b=0 is a stationary point of map \u000117\u0002.\nThe unstable manifold of xs is two dimensional and it is\nspanned by the two unstable eigenvectors of Eq. \u000117\u0002. As-\nsume first that the eigenvalues \f1 and \f2 of A are real and\nsatisfy \u000b\f1,2\u000b\t1. The point xs is a stable node for the original\nmap and a saddle point for the extended map \u000117\u0002. The ei-\ngenvalues for the extended map are \f1 ,\f2 ,\f1\n\u22121\n,\f2\n\u22121\n. The\nstable eigenvectors associated with the contracting eigenval-\nues are called es1 and es2 where the index s indicates stable.\nThe unstable eigenvectors are denoted by eu1 and eu2. As the\npoint is a stable focus for the original system, the two con-\ntracting eigenvectors have no \b components and the stable\nmanifold coincides with the coordinate plane. On the other\nhand, the expanding eigenvectors must have \b components\ndifferent than zero.\nA generic point x0= \u0001\u0004x ,\b\u0002 in the neighborhood of \u0001xs ,0\u0002\ncan be written as a linear combination of the eigenvectors\nx0 = cs1es1 + cs2es2 + cu1eu1 + cu2eu2, \u000118\u0002\nwhere the coefficients cs1, cs2, cu1, and cu2 are real. The evo-\nlution of the point x0 is\nBERI et al.

The eigenvectors\neu1,2 span the unstable manifold. Once eu1,2 are known, an\nexpression for the Lagrangian manifold can be obtained: The\ngeneric form for a point on the UM is obtained by setting\ncs1=cs2=0 in Eq. \u000118\u0002. Separating the space and the \b com-\nponents we obtain\n\u0012x\u0001\n\b\u0001\n\u0013 = cu1\u0012e\u0001u1x\ne\u0001u1\b\n\u0013 + cu2\u0012e\u0001u2x\ne\u0001u2\b\n\u0013 . \u000120\u0002\nHere u\u0001u1x and eu1\b represent the x and \b components of the\neigenvectors e\u0001u1,2.

Here\nthe eigenvalues \f1,2 are real and \u000b\f1,2\u000b\u00051. The point \u0001xs ,0\u0002\nis a saddle point of the extended map \u000117\u0002 with eigenvalues\n\f1 ,\f2 ,\f1\n\u22121\n,\f2\n\u22121 and corresponding eigenvectors eu1, eu2, es1,\nand es2. The eigenvectors corresponding to expanding mo-\ntion have \b components equal to zero, while the components\nfor contracting eigenvectors are nonzero. The unstable mani-\nfold coincides with the coordinate plane, while the stable\nmanifold is expressed by the relation \b\u0001 =Mx\u0001 with M defined\nas\nM = \u0012es1\bx es2\bx\nes1\by es2\by\n\u0013\u0012es1x es2x\nes1y es2y\n\u0013\u22121. \u000123\u0002\nWe can summarize the effect of noise as follows. In the\ncase of a stable point, noise introduces in the system two\nunstable directions and creates an unstable manifold in the\nextended phase space. For an unstable point, the situation is\nprecisely the opposite: noise induces stable directions and\ncreates the stable manifold. The situation differs, however, in\nthe case where xs is a saddle point of the noise-free system.\nHere, one of the eigenvalues, e.g., \f1 will have a modulus\nbigger than one, whereas for the other eigenvalue the modu-\nlus is smaller. Stable and unstable directions are already\npresent in the noise-free system. Noise then induces an ad-\nditional stable direction and an additional unstable one. In\nthe extended system, the unstable manifold is spanned by a\n\u201cdeterministic\u201d eigenvector eu1 that has zero \b components,\nand by eu2 having \b components different than zero. In the\nsame way, the stable manifold is spanned by a \u201cdeterminis-\ntic\u201d eigenvector es1 and by a \u201cfluctuational\u201d eigenvector es2.\nThe matrix M defining the unstable manifold of xs is given\nby\nM = \u00120 eu2\bx0 eu2\by\u0013\u0012eu1x eu2xeu1y eu2y \u0013\n\u22121\n\u000124\u0002\nand in the same way the matrix defining the stable manifold\nis given by\nM = \u00120 es2\bx0 es2\by\u0013\u0012es1x es2xes1y es2y \u0013\n\u22121\n. \u000125\u0002\nConsider now the case when the stationary point is a spi-\nral node \u000346\u0004. Its eigenvalues \f1,2 are complex conjugates. If\n\u000b\f1,2\u000b\t1, xs is a stable spiral node, a generic vector on the\nunstable manifold is written as Eq. \u000118\u0002 with coefficients\ncs1,2=0, and the coefficients cu1,2 are arbitrary complex num-\nbers. The matrix M defining the unstable manifold is then\ncalculated in the same way as in the case of a stable focus. It\nshould be noted that, although the coefficients e\u0001u1,2 are com-\nplex numbers, the final matrix M is real. The stable manifold\nfor xs is defined by the simple relation \b\u0001 =0.\nIn the case of an unstable spiral node, the stable and un-\nstable manifolds swap their roles: The unstable manifold is\ndefined as \b\u0001 =0 and the stable one by the matrix M.\nNext, we investigate the case of a stable state of period p.\nIt is an orbit defined by \u0005xs1 ,xs2 , . . . ,xsp\u22121 ,xsp\u0006 with xsp=xs1.\nA small neighborhood of xsn is mapped by Eq. \u00018\u0002 to a small\nneighborhood of xsn+1 and the shape of the manifold can be\ncalculated in the close vicinity of each of the points of the\nperiodic orbit. We start by describing the manifold close to\nxs1. In a small neighborhood of xs1, the extended map can be\nwritten as\n\u0004xn+1 = \r\u0010 \u0001K\u0001x \u0010xs1\u000e\u0004xn + \bn = A\u0004xn + \bn\n\bn+1 = \r\u0010 \u0001K\u0001x \u0010xs2\u000e\n\u22121T\n\bn = B\u22121T\bn, \u000126\u0002\nwhere \u0004xn is a small displacement about xs1 and \u0004xn+1 is a\nsmall displacement about xs2. The matrix A is the Jacobian of\nthe map calculated at xs1 and B is the Jacobian matrix calcu-\nlated at xs2. As in the case p=1, a generic point x0= \u0001\u0004x ,\b\u0002 in\na neighborhood of xs1 can be expanded as a combination of\nthe eigenvectors of Eq. \u000126\u0002: x0=cs1es1+cs2es2+cu1eu1\n+cu2eu2 where the coefficients are real if the eigenvectors are\nreal or complex if the eigenvectors are complex. As in the\nprevious case of p=1, the unstable manifold of the orbit in\nthe vicinity of xs1 is described by the matrix\nSOLUTION OF THE BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM FOR\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 036131 \u00012005\u0002\n036131-5\nM = \u0012eu1\bx eu2\bx\neu1\by eu2\by\n\u0013\u0012eu1x eu2x\neu1y eu2y\n\u0013\u22121, \u000127\u0002\nwith the same notation as in Eq. \u000123\u0002. The same calculation\ncan be repeated in order to calculate the local shape of the\nunstable manifold in the neighborhood of the other points\nforming the periodic orbit. The case p=2 will be considered\nexplicitly below.\nThe case of a continuous flow, can be treated as usual as\nthe limit for h\u21920 of the Euler integration scheme. Similarly\na substitution of the Euler approximation f\u0001xn\u0002=xn+hK\u0001xn\u0002\ninto Eq. \u000117\u0002 recovers a well-known result for the linearized\nHamiltonian equations of continuous systems \u0001cf., e.g.,\n\u000317,31\u0004\u0002\n\u0014\u0004x\u02d9 = K\u0001\u0001x0\u0002\u0004x + p ,p\u02d9 = \u2212 K\u0001\u0001x0\u0002p , \u000128\u0002\nwhere K\u0001\u0001x0\u0002 indicates the derivative of K\u0001x\u0002 calculated at\nx0. In matrix form Eqs. \u000128\u0002 read as\n\u0012\u0004x\u02d9\np\u02d9\n\u0013 = \u0012B 10 \u2212 B \u0013\u0012\u0004xp \u0013 , \u000129\u0002\nwhere B=K\u0001\u0001x0\u0002 and \u0004x is a small deviation of the coordi-\nnate from the fixed point attractor x0. The generic point on\nthe unstable manifold is written in this case as x\u0001t\u0002\n=cu1eu1 exp\f1t+cu2\r2\nu exp\f2t where cu1,2 are complex coeffi-\ncients and \f1 and \f2 are two positive eigenvalues corre-\nsponding to the unstable eigenvectors \r1u and \r2u.

LINEAR ANALYSIS OF THE ACTION SURFACE\nIn the previous section, we addressed the problem of cal-\nculating the proper initial conditions to describe a trajectory\nperforming the transition from a steady state to a remote final\nstate. In order to calculate the transition probability, the non-\nequilibrium potential \u0001or action\u0002 must be also known. In this\nsection we perform a similar analysis in order to describe the\naction surface in the vicinity of the stationary points.\nConsideration of the relation \u000e\u0007exp\u0003\u2212S \/\u0003\u0004 shows that the\nquasipotential exhibits local minima corresponding to the\nstable equilibrium orbits of the original system. Similarly, it\ndisplays local maxima corresponding to unstable orbits. For\nthis reason, we expect to be able to express the potential in a\nneighborhood of stable equilibrium orbit as a quadratic form.\nFor example, in the vicinity of a stationary point x0, the\npotential can be approximated using a paraboloid\nS\u0003\u0004x\u0004 = S0 +\n1\n2\n\u0004xTW\u0004x , \u000132\u0002\nwhere S0 is the potential exactly on the stationary point and\n\u0004x represents a small deviation from x0. The positively de-\nfined symmetrical matrix W describes the shape of the po-\ntential around the stationary point. The case of a stable peri-\nodic structure is similar: For a periodic solution of period p\n\u0005xs1 ,xs2 , . . . ,xsp\u22121 ,xsp\u0006 with xsp+1=xs1, the potential is still\nquadratic, but its shape differs in the vicinity of the different\npoints of the orbit.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, a point in the vicinity of the stable\norbit can be described by giving it an integer number indi-\ncating the closest point on the stable orbit, and a vector \u0004x\ngiving the small displacement from that point. The potential\ncan then be written as\nS\u0003i,\u0004x\u0004 = S0 +\n1\n2\n\u0004xTWi\u0004x , \u000133\u0002\nwhere i is the integer defining the point on the stable orbit\nand Wi is the quadratic form defining the potential in the\nvicinity of xsi.\nThe case of a periodic orbit in the continuous system is a\nlimit for the discrete system. The space in the vicinity of a\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 Points in the vicinity of a period-3\norbit are described using the integer i\u0002 \u00031\u00af3\u0004 and a real vector \u0004x\ndescribing the displacement; \u0001b\u0002 the region of coordinate space in\nthe neighborhood of a limit cycle is described using a real param-\neter \u0006 and a vector \u0004x measuring the displacement.\nBERI et al.

Similar to our calculation of the\nlocal shape of the Lagrangian manifold, we will start calcu-\nlating W for the simplest case of a period-one orbit, and we\nwill then move toward more complicated stationary struc-\ntures.\nConsider the case of a period-1 stable point in a two-\ndimensional map. In the vicinity of the stable point xs, the\ndynamics of the map can be linearized to obtain Eq. \u000117\u0002\n\u0004xn+1 = A\u0004xn + \bn,\n\u000135\u0002\n\bn+1 = A\u22121\bn.\nFrom the previous section, we know that the relation \b\n=M\u0004x holds for the dynamics on the unstable manifold.\nGiven a point \u0004x in the vicinity of the stable point, the cor-\nresponding action has to be calculated along the trajectory\nemanating from the steady state at n\u2192\u2212\n.\nS =\n1\n2\u000f\n\u2212\n\n1\n\bn\nT\bn, \u000136\u0002\nwhere the T indicates the transpose operation on the matrix.\nUsing the relation \u000121\u0002, the action can be rewritten as\nS =\n1\n2\u000f\n\u2212\n\n1\n\u0004xn\nTMTM\u0004xn. \u000137\u0002\nIn order to express the action at the point \u0004x, it is necessary\nto express the coordinate \u0004xn as a function of \u0004x. Manipulat-\ning the first equation in Eqs. \u000117\u0002, the motion of the coordi-\nnate \u0004x on the unstable manifold is expressed by \u0004xn+1= \u0001A\n+M\u0002\u0004xn. In general we have \u0004x\u2212n= \u0001A+M\u0002\u2212n\u0004x.

Being a\nproduct of a matrix with its transpose, the eigenvalues of W\ncan be only positive or zero.\nConsider now the case of a period-two stable orbit. In this\ncase, the motion in the vicinity of the periodic orbit can be\ndescribed using two different maps: one that maps points\nfrom a neighborhood of xs1 to a neighborhood of xs2, and one\nthat maps from a neighborhood of xs2 to a neighborhood of\nxs1.\n\u0004xn+1 = A1\u0004xn + \bn\n\bn+1 = A2\n\u2212T\bn\n,\n\u0004xn+1 = A2\u0004xn + \bn\n\bn+1 = A1\n\u2212T\bn\n, \u000139\u0002\nwhere A1= \u000b\u0001K \/\u0001x\u000bxs1 and A2= \u000b\u0001K \/\u0001x\u000bxs2. The first map de-\nscribes the transitions from the vicinity of xs1 to the vicinity\nof xs2, the second map does the opposite.\nThe potential is a sum of different contributions: The in-\ncrease in the potential due to jumps from the vicinity of xs1\nto the vicinity of xs2, and the contribution due to the opposite\ntype of jump. The potential in a neighborhood of xs1 is writ-\nten as\nS =\n1\n2\u000f\n\u2212\n\n0\n\u0004x0\nTM1\nTA1\u0001A2A1\u0002n\u0001A2A1\u0002TnA1\nTM1\u0004x0\n+\n1\n2\u000f\n\u2212\n\n\u22121\n\u0004x0\nTM1\nT\u0001A2A1\u0002n\u0001A2A1\u0002TnM1\u0004x0 + S0. \u000140\u0002\nHere the first sum counts the contributions due to jumps\nfrom xs2 to xs1, and the second sum contains the contribution\nof the jumps from xs1 to xs2.

The po-\ntential can be calculated in the vicinity of stationary struc-\ntures using either of two different approaches. The first con-\nsists of an application of the results obtained in the case of a\nmap, using the limit h\u21920 in the Euler discretization scheme.\nIn the case of a stable point, this gives\nS = S0 +\n1\n2\n\u0004x0\nTMT\u0012\f\n\u2212\n\n0\ne\u2212Ate\u2212A\nTtdt\u0013M\u0004x0 \u000142\u0002\nand\nW = MT\u0012\f\n\u2212\n\n0\ne\u2212Ate\u2212A\nTtdt\u0013M , \u000143\u0002\nand, for a limit cycle, it gives\nW\u0001\u0006\u0002 = M\u0001\u0006\u0002T\u0012\f\n\u2212\n\n0\ne\u2212Ate\u2212A\nTtdt\u0013M\u0001\u0006\u0002 , \u000144\u0002\nwhere the parameter \u0006 is the coordinate along the cycle and\n\u0004x is the displacement from the limit cycle. The local shape\nof the action calculated in the neighborhood of a limit cycle\ncan be equivalently calculated by solving a Riccati equation\nwith periodic boundary conditions \u000318\u0004. It is worth noting\nthat, in the case of a continuous system, the Hamiltonian\nSOLUTION OF THE BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM FOR\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 036131 \u00012005\u0002\n036131-7\nformalism guarantees the well-known relation between the\npotential and the momenta\npi =\n\u0001S\n\u0001xi\n, \u000145\u0002\nwhich implies W=M. However, this result cannot be ex-\nported straightforwardly to the case of discrete systems and,\nin the general case, W\u0002M. An explicit example of this prop-\nerty will be given in the next section.\nWhen an unstable state is considered, the situation can be\ndifferent: The potential still exhibits a local maximum, but\nthe simple quadratic description might not apply: The poten-\ntial might display singular features and be wildly nondiffer-\nentiable \u000317,21,31\u0004. Consider, for example, the IVDP system\nor the harmonically driven overdamped Duffing oscillator. In\nboth systems a switching line converges asymptotically to\nthe saddle cycle. As a result, a series of singularities in the\naction surface accumulate at the boundary and, given a small\nneighborhood of the cycle, the quasipotential there contains\ninfinitely many nondifferentiable points.\nA. Example: 1D system\nTo understand better the theory explained in the previous\nsection, and in particular to show explicitly how the matrices\nM and W can differ for a generic map, we present as an\nexample a simple one-dimensional linear system.\nConsider the map xi+1=axi+\u0002i, where \u000ba\u000b\t1. The sto-\nchastic process \u0002 has zero mean \u0007\u0002\b=0 and delta correlation\n\u0007\u0002i\u0002 j\b=\u0003\u0004ij, where \u0003 is the noise intensity. The corresponding\nextended map is\n\u0004xi+1 = axi + \bi,\n\u000146\u0002\n\bi+1 =\n1\na\n\bi.\nThe eigenvalues of the extended system are a and 1\/a. The\nstable manifold is defined by the relation \b=0 and the un-\nstable manifold by the relation \b=\u2212\u0001a\u22121\/a\u0002x; these give the\nmatrix \u0001in this case a scalar, in actuality\u0002 M =\u2212\u0001a\u22121\/a\u0002. Mo-\ntion on the unstable manifold is regulated by the equation\nxi+1= \u00011\/a\u0002xi. The potential of a given point x is calculated\nusing\nS =\n1\n2\u000f\n\u2212\n\n\u22121\n\bi\n2\n=\n1\n2\u000f1\n\n \u0012a \u2212 1\na\n\u00132a2nx2 \u000147\u0002\nand the summation is performed in the standard way to ob-\ntain S= 12 \u00011\u2212a\n2\u0002x2. Thus the matrix W is found explicitly as\nW= \u00011\u2212a2\u0002. So the matrices W and M are different.\nIn order to test these results, the system \u000146\u0002 was solved\nnumerically by Monte Carlo simulation. First the stationary\ndistribution was obtained by consideration of a collection of\n106 points \u0001the system is obviously ergodic\u0002; the mean and\nthe mean-square deviations were computed using the least-\nsquares technique, and their values compared with the theory\nas shown in Fig. 3. The agreement was found to be excellent\nfor a wide range of a and \u0003 values.\nAs a second example, we consider a one-dimensional lin-\near continuous system x\u02d9=\u2212ax+\u0002. The parameter a is larger\nthan zero and \u0002 is a white uncorrelated Gaussian noise of\nintensity \u0003. The extended Hamiltonian system is the limit as\nthe integration step h\u21920 of the following map\n\u0004xi+1 = \u00011 \u2212 ah\u0002xi + h\bi,\n\u000148\u0002\n\bi+1 =\n1\n1 \u2212 ah\n\bi.\nRepeating the same calculation as above, the eigenspaces for\nmap \u000148\u0002 are \b=0 and \b=\u22121\/h\u0003\u00011\u2212ah\u0002\u22121\/ \u00011\u2212ah\u0002\u0004x. We\nthen have M =\u22121\/h\u0003\u00011\u2212ah\u0002\u22121\/ \u00011\u2212ah\u0002\u0004. The action for a\ngiven point is calculated using the summation procedure\nS =\n1\n2\nh\u000f\n\u2212\n\n1\n\bn\n2\n=\nh\n2\u000f1\n\n 1\nh2\r\u00011 \u2212 ah\u0002 \u2212 11 \u2212 ah\u000e2\u00011 \u2212 ah\u00022nx2.\n\u000149\u0002\nPerforming the summation we get\nS =\n1\n2h\u0012\u00011 \u2212 ah\u0002 \u2212 11 \u2212 ah\u0013\n2 \u00011 \u2212 ah\u00022\n1 \u2212 \u00011 \u2212 ah\u00022\nx2, \u000150\u0002\nwhich gives W=1\/h(1\u2212 \u00011\u2212ah\u00022). For a given finite value of\nh, the two matrices W and M are different. However, in the\nlimit h\u21920, M\u21922a, and W\u21922a. This recovers the standard\nresult \b=\u0001S \/\u0001x in the case of a continuous system.\nVI. PARAMETRIZATION OF THE FAMILY\nOF TRAJECTORIES\nThe first step toward the solution of the escape problem is\nthe identification of a proper way of parametrizing the family\nof escape trajectories. Since Eq. \u000121\u0002 holds, it is enough to\nprovide a parametrization of the trajectories in the coordinate\nspace.\nFor a two-dimensional continuous system, in the vicinity\nof a stable point, the trajectories can be parametrized by\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Comparison between numerical simula-\ntion \u0001small dots\u0002 and theory \u0001black thin line\u0002 for the system \u000146\u0002.\nThe noise intensity is \u0003=0.1, and parameter a=0.4. The numerical\nvalue of W=0.842 255 and the theoretical value is W=1\u2212a2\n=0.840 000. The theory and the numerics almost completely over-\nlap. Similar agreement has been obtained for a wide range of values\nof a and noise intensities \u0003.\nBERI et al.

The\ninitial conditions can be chosen on a small annulus with\nextreme radii r1 and r2 as shown in Fig. 4. We are interested\nin giving a parametrization for all possible trajectories in the\npattern. It is clear that this requires particular care in the\nchoice of the possible radii r1 and r2. A wrong choice of r1\nand r2 might result in some trajectories in the pattern not to\nbe sampled with this choice. In order to include all the tra-\njectories in the pattern the radii r1 and r2 must be chosen\nsuch that the iterations of the annulus cover the full mani-\nfold. Providing the radii to be small enough, it is sufficient to\nsatisfy the condition for the linearized system around the\nstationary point. Once the extreme radii are chosen, a pos-\nsible choice of parameters to describe the trajectories might\nbe the radius r of a small circle about the origin and the\nangular position \u0010 on it \u0001see Fig. 4\u0002.\nIn the general case, the parameter space for a\nN-dimensional continuous system is diffeomorph to a \u0001N\n\u22121\u0002-dimensional product of tori Tn; for a N-dimensional\nmap; it is diffeomorph to a N-dimensional product of tori Tn.\nOnce initial conditions are defined on the coordinate space,\nthe relation \u000121\u0002 is used to work out the corresponding mo-\nmenta.\nVII. ACTION PLOT AND THE SOLUTION\nOF THE BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEM\nIn this section we will show in a very effective way how\nthe cost function can differ markedly for different escape\ntrajectories and we will provide a tool for the solution of the\nboundary values problems.\nTo make it easier for the reader to follow the rationale of\nthis section, we will stick to the case of a two-dimensional\ncontinuous system with a stable point and a saddle cycle;\nhowever, the discussion is actually more general and can be\nrewritten in an analogous way for the case of discrete sys-\ntems. The theory described in the previous sections allows us\nto give a parametrization of the trajectories emanating from\nan initial stable structure \u0001for the noise-free case\u0002 and span-\nning the unstable Lagrangian manifold. Each of these trajec-\ntories emanates from the stable state at t\u2192\u2212\n and moves on\nthe manifold in the 2n-dimensional phase space. In a projec-\ntion they appear to wander around on the coordinate space\nand eventually they may escape the basin of attraction of the\ninitial stable state. In order to give a good representation of\nthe escape energy, we consider each trajectory in the pattern.\nAs this path is on the manifold, it can be unambiguously\ndescribed, providing parameters in the way described in Sec.\nIV. The cost of the trajectory \u0001namely, its action\u0002 at the mo-\nment of escape is thus expressed unambiguously as a func-\ntion defined on the parameter\u2019s space. We will refer to the\ngraphical presentation of the action as a function of the pa-\nrameters with the term action plot.\nThe behavior of the trajectories during the fluctuation al-\nlows us to identify two different regions in the parameter\nspace. Trajectories in the first region can cross the boundary\nof the basin of attraction and move further to reach the basins\nof attraction of different stable points. A second class of tra-\njectories has a different kind of dynamics: They first move\ntoward the basin boundary, but their momentum is insuffi-\ncient to allow them to cross the boundary; so they are re-\nflected back to the interior of the basin of attraction. The two\nregions are separated by closed curves in the parameter space\ncorresponding to heteroclinic trajectories. The values of the\naction corresponding to the two different regions are signifi-\ncantly different. This may be explained in the following way:\nThe cost function S evolves along the Hamiltonian trajecto-\nries according to Eq. \u000113\u0002. Thus S\u02d9 is a positively defined\nquadratic form in the auxiliary momentum p\u0001 . Consider now\nthe most probable escape path \u00060. During the fluctuation\nfrom the initial state toward the boundary, p\u0001 is significantly\ndifferent than zero and the cost function increases along the\nmotion. As the system approaches the cycle, p\u0001 decreases ex-\nponentially and the optimal path converges to the limit cycle\nasymptotically. At the same time the cost function ap-\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 Possible way to parametrize the un-\nstable manifold of a stable point in a two-dimensional system.

Consider a path \u00061 that is a perturbation of the\noptimal path. As a first possibility, the momentum \u000bp\u0001 \u000b on \u00061\nmay be bigger than on \u00060; as a result, \u00061 hits the cycle with\na residual momentum. The cost function calculated along \u00061\nS1=\t\u00061\u000bp\u0001 \u000b\n2dt will be slightly higher than S0. Changing the\ntrajectory continuously, it may have a cost S1 indefinitely\nclose to S0.\nA second class of trajectories is also possible: Consider a\ntrajectory \u00062 having a slightly smaller momentum than \u00060.\nSuch a trajectory cannot overcome the repelling force of the\nlimit cycle: It will come very close to the the cycle, but it\nwill be repelled back toward the initial state. In this process,\nits cost S2 remains slightly smaller than the activation energy\nS0. During the motion toward the stable state, the momentum\nof \u00062 stays very small and its cost will not increase signifi-\ncantly. After reaching some internal part of the basin of at-\ntraction, the fluctuational motion will start once more and\nthen the path will again move toward the limit cycle. During\nthis second outward motion, its momentum becomes once\nmore significantly different than zero. For this reason, when\n\u00062 away from the limit cycle, its cost will be significantly\nbigger than the activation S0. For this second class of trajec-\ntories, it is impossible to approach the cost S0 by changing\nthe momentum continuously: A discontinuity in the cost\nfunction is always present. The different behaviors of the\ntrajectories are summarized in Fig. 5.\nAccording to the previous discussion, the cost function is\na discontinuous function in the parameter space and the dis-\ncontinuities correspond to heteroclinic trajectories. The\nlowest-cost heteroclinic trajectory is the optimal path.\nA. Self similarity of the action plot\nThe structure of the action plot for a generic nonequilib-\nrium system with a limit cycle can be very complicated. In\nFig. 6\u0001a\u0002 the action plot is shown for the inverted van der Pol\noscillator \u0001which will be discussed in more detail Sec.\nVII B\u0002. The features that will be described for this system are\nin fact very general, as will become apparent from the dis-\ncussion.\nIt is evident that the action plot has a wildly singular\nstructure composed of broad, rounded, \u201chills\u201d \u0003for example,\nthe region a\u2013c in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002\u0004 and very sharp \u201cpeaks.\u201d At the\nedges of the hills, discontinuities are present, such as those\nmarked by \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002. According to the discus-\nsion above, each of the discontinuities corresponds to a het-\neroclinic trajectory. The discontinuity with the lowest action\n\u0003marked as \u00011\u0002\u0004 corresponds to the optimal path. On the other\nhand, the presence of other discontinuities suggests the pres-\nence of other nonoptimal heteroclinic paths.\nA zoom inside the first peak \u0003Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002\u0004 reveals the pres-\nence of closely similar structure: A smooth hill with two\nsharp peaks at each side. The discontinuities between hill and\npeaks are marked by arrows \u00013\u0002 and \u00014\u0002. Inside the peaks,\nmore hills and peaks are present. Two more discontinuities\nare marked with arrows \u00015\u0002 and \u00016\u0002. Such a structure contin-\nues indefinitely: Smaller and smaller hills exist, having\nhigher and higher cost, and infinitely many discontinuities\nare present in the action plot.\nThe complex structure described here can be understood\non the basis of the arguments introduced in Sec. VII. The\nfirst hills correspond to trajectories that cross the cycle dur-\ning their fluctuation. The trajectories in the peaks have a\nsignificantly different cost: They are paths that have been\nreflected back and experienced the \u0001cost-demanding\u0002 fluctua-\ntional motion twice. Inside the peaks, trajectories that are\nreflected back only once form the lower hills and trajectories\nFIG. 5. \u0001Color online\u0002 Three different classes of trajectories are\npossible for a system with a saddle cycle. \u00060 is the heteroclinic\npath: It reaches the cycle \u0001dashed line\u0002 asymptotically for t\u2192 +\n;\n\u00061 has a bigger momentum and crosses the cycle; \u00062 has insufficient\nmomentum to reach the cycle and it is reflected back.\nFIG. 6. \u0001a\u0002 The action plot for the IVDP system.

Arrows \u00013\u0002 and \u00014\u0002 show other\ndiscontinuities in the second hill. \u0001b\u0002 A zoom of the first peak \u0003area\nincluded between the points marked by the arrows \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002\u0004\nreveals the self-repeating structure of the action plot. The points\nmarked with \u00015\u0002 and \u00016\u0002 are other discontinuity points in the peak.\nBERI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 036131 \u00012005\u0002\n036131-10\nthat are reflected back more than once form the internal\npeaks. This process goes on indefinitely and a hierarchy of\ntrajectories can be built according to the number of reflec-\ntions back from the limit cycle that they experience.\nThe peculiar structure of the action plot can be used to\nlocate the heteroclinic trajectories in the system and, in par-\nticular, the optimal path. The optimal path corresponds to the\nminimum action heteroclinic path; other heteroclinic trajec-\ntories present in the system are nonoptimal.\nB. IVDP system\nAs our first application, we study the activation energy for\nnoise-induced escape in the inverted van der Pol oscillator\n\u000348\u0004. The IVDP has already been mentioned above: It is a\nnonlinear oscillator containing terms describing losses and\nenergy pumping. The dynamical model is\nx\u00a8 = \u2212 2\u000b\u00011 \u2212 x2\u0002x\u02d9 \u2212 x + \n4\u000bT\u0002\u0001t\u0002 , \u000151\u0002\nwhere x is a dynamical variable and \u0002\u0001t\u0002 is a noise process.\nIn what follows we will assume \u0002\u0001t\u0002 to be a zero-mean white\nGaussian process. Its correlation function is \u0007\u0002\u0001t\u0002\u0002\u0001s\u0002\b=\u0004\u0001t\n\u2212s\u0002. The intensity of the noise term is \u0003=\n4\u000bT where T is\nthe thermodynamic temperature of the system. The positive\nparameter \u000b in Eq. \u000151\u0002 regulates not only the friction but\nalso the pumping of energy into the system, which keeps the\nsystem away from thermodynamic equilibrium. As a result,\nthe activation energy of this system displays a dependence\non the value of \u000b that is nontrivial.\nThe dynamics of the system can be better understood with\nthe substitution y= x\u02d9. In this way Eq. \u000151\u0002 can be rewritten as\nx\u02d9 = y ,\ny\u02d9 = \u2212 2\u000b\u00011 \u2212 x2\u0002y \u2212 x + \n4\u000bT\u0002\u0001t\u0002 . \u000152\u0002\nIn the coordinate space x-y, the noise-free dynamics of the\nsystem can be summarized as follows: The origin O= \u00010;0\u0002\nis a stable equilibrium point. Its basin of attraction \u0012 is lim-\nited by a saddle cycle. The stability of O depends on the\nparameter \u000b and can be studied using linear analysis. In the\nvicinity of O, the system becomes\n\u0012x\u02d9\ny\u02d9\n\u0013 = \u0012 0 1\n\u2212 1 \u2212 2\u000b \u0013\u0012xy \u0013 . \u000153\u0002\nThe nature of the fixed point depends on the eigenvalues of\nthe system \b1,2=\u2212\u000b\u00b1\n\u000b2\u22121. For values of \u000b smaller than 1,\n\b1,2 are complex conjugates and the fixed point is a spiral\nnode; for \u000b=1 the system bifurcates, \b1,2 become real and O\nbecomes a stable node. The particular case \u000b=0 correspond\nto an ideal harmonic oscillator of frequency 1.\nWhen noise is added in the system, transitions from the\nstable origin to the limit cycle become possible. As discussed\nabove, when the noise intensity is small, noise-induced es-\ncape from the basin of attraction of the fixed point is gov-\nerned by the properties of the most probable escape path,\nwhich is the heteroclinic trajectory of lowest cost. As the\nnoise intensity \u0003 depends on both temperature and friction\ncoefficient, the parameter that becomes indefinitely small is\nT while the parameter \u000b is held at a fixed value.\nThe action plot can be used successfully to calculate the\nactivation energy in the system. As discussed in Sec. V, the\npattern of trajectories is parametrized by setting the initial\nconditions on a small circle around O. The parameter space\nis thus diffeomorph to a S1. The action plot as a function of\nthe angular position \u0010 on the circle is shown in Figs. 6\u0001a\u0002\nand 6\u0001b\u0002. Interesting paths in the pattern of optimal trajecto-\nries are shown in Fig. 7 together with singularities in the\npattern \u0001dashed lines\u0002.\nThe optimal escape path is marked with the letter \u201ca.\u201d It\nreaches the cycle tangentially for t\u2192\n. It corresponds to the\ndiscontinuity \u201ca\u201d in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002. Its action corresponds to the\nabsolute minimum in the action plot. The path \u201cb\u201d in Fig. 7\ncorresponds to the top of the first hill in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002. Its cost is\nthe maximum cost possible for a trajectory in the first hill.\nThe path \u201cc\u201d in Fig. 7 is a nonoptimal heteroclinic path: It\nreaches the cycle asymptotically for t\u2192\n, but its cost is\nbigger than the activation energy \u0001the cost of path \u201ca\u201d\u0002. It\ncorresponds to the discontinuity \u201cc\u201d in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002. It is pos-\nsible to move continuously from path \u201ca\u201d to path \u201cc\u201d along\nthe first hill by continuously changing the parameter \u0010 in the\naction plot.\nDue to the central symmetry in the system of Eqs. \u000152\u0002\ntwo trajectories, such that one is the central reflection of the\nother, have the same cost. Due to this symmetry, the action\nplot, as a function of \u0010, has a period of \u0013 and not 2\u0013. This\nmeans that two degenerate optimal paths are present in the\nsystem: the path \u201ca\u201d in Fig. 7 and that obtained from \u201ca\u201d by\ncentral reflection. In Fig. 7 the singularities in the pattern of\noptimal trajectories are shown as dashed lines. They are\ncaustics, i.e., envelopes of Hamiltonian trajectories.

Harmonically driven overdamped Duffing oscillator\nThe inverted van der Pol oscillator described in Sec.\nVII B represents an archetypal nonequilibrium autonomous\nsystem with a limit cycle. In this section we show how the\nsame method can be applied to the case of a nonautonomous\nsystem with limit cycles. In particular, we consider a poten-\ntial system kept out of equilibrium by a time dependent ex-\nternal force. Consider a bistable potential U=\u2212 12x2+\n1\n4x\n4\n\u0001Duffing potential\u0002 and consider a particle moving according\nto\nx\u02d9 = \u2212 \u0003U + A sin\u0001\u0014t\u0002 + \n\u0003\u0002\u0001t\u0002 . \u000154\u0002\nHere the harmonic driving keeps the system away from equi-\nlibrium so that the detailed balance condition does not hold;\nthe amplitude A of the driving force is chosen large enough\nto be beyond the perturbative regime. The driving frequency\nis comparable with other time scales present in the system.\nThe noise is introduced in the model by the stochastic vari-\nable \u0002. In what follows, we consider \u0002 to be a standard zero-\nmean white Gaussian noise. Its correlation function is\n\u0007\u0002\u0001t\u0002\u0002\u0001s\u0002\b=\u0004\u0001t\u2212s\u0002. The one-dimensional system \u000154\u0002 is a\nnonautonomous; in order to make it an autonomous system,\nthe following auxiliary system is introduced:\nx\u02d91 = \u0014 ,\n\u000155\u0002\nx\u02d92 = \u2212 \u0003U + A sin\u0001x1\u0002 + \n\u0003\u0002\u0001t\u0002 .\nThe system \u000155\u0002 is two-dimensional, but it is now autono-\nmous.\nThe presence of the external driving transforms the equi-\nlibrium points to limit cycles of period 2\u0013 \/\u0014: The minima of\nthe potential U for x= \u00b11 become stable limit cycles and the\nmaximum of the potential becomes a saddle cycle. The pres-\nence of noise in the system might induce transitions from\none stable cycle to the other one, across the unstable cycle.\nIn order to calculate their probability, the extended system\nx\u02d91 = \u0014 , \u000156\u0002\nx\u02d92 = \u2212 \u0003U + A sin\u0001x1\u0002 + p2,\np\u02d91 = \u2212 A cos\u0001x1\u0002p2,\np\u02d92 =\nd2U\ndx2\n2 p2,\nhas to be solved with a proper choice of boundary condi-\ntions: \u0001x1 ;x2\u0002 must be on the stable cycle for t\u2192\u2212\n and on\nthe saddle cycle for t\u2192\n.\nThe trajectories emanating from the stable cycle are a\none-parameter family on the unstable manifold. A possible\nchoice of parametrization can be as follows. Let the initial\nconditions be chosen to be of form \u0001x1 ;x2\u0002= (x1c\u0001\u0010\u0002 ,x2c\u0001\u0010\u0002\n+\u0004), where x1c and x2c are the coordinates of the stable cycle\nat a given phase \u0010 and \u0004 is a small displacement in the x2\ndirection. The parameter \u0010 parametrizes the family of trajec-\ntories. The optimal path found for the system is shown in\nFig. 9. It is an heteroclinic trajectory reaching the saddle\ncycle for t\u2192\n.\nD. Henon map\nAs a second example of the application of the formalism,\nwe consider the case of a noise-driven Henon map. The\nHenon map, introduced in 1976 by Henon \u000349\u0004, takes the\nform\nFIG. 8. The activation energy for escape in the inverted van der\nPol oscillator as a function of the \u000b parameter.

Different regimes of\ncomplexity can be obtained in this system by tuning the pa-\nrameters in an appropriate way \u0001see, for instance, \u000349,50\u0004\u0002. In\nthis section we will apply the technique described to regimes\nwhich are more and more complex. We start with a choice of\nparameters \u0001a=1.1, b=\u22120.3\u0002 corresponding to one stable\nperiod-1 orbit and one attractor at infinity. The boundary of\nthe basin of attraction is then smooth \u0001nonfractal\u0002 and a\nperiod-1 saddle orbit is present in the boundary. The ex-\ntended system corresponding to Eq. \u000157\u0002 is\n\u0016\nxn+1 = a \u2212 xn\n2 + byn + \bxn,\nyn+1 = xn,\n\bxn+1 = \byn,\n\byn+1 =\n\bxn + 2xn+1\bxn\nb\n\u0017 \u000158\u0002\nand the activation energy evolves along the trajectory ac-\ncording to En+1=En+\n1\n2\bxn\n2\n.\nIn the extended system \u000158\u0002, the stable orbit becomes a\nsaddle, and the escape trajectories span its unstable manifold.\nAccording to the general theory, it is a two-dimensional sur-\nface and the trajectories form a two-parameter family. From\nthe linearization of the system \u000158\u0002, the manifold can be\ndefined in a neighborhood of the initial state and a linear\nrelation \u000121\u0002 between coordinates and momenta is obtained.\nThe matrix Mij, which appears in Eq. \u000121\u0002, is here a 2\u000f2\nmatrix.\nA suitable choice for the parametrization of the manifold\nabout the initial state is the radius and the angular position on\na small circle around the point. The action plot is here a\nfunction S1\u000fS1\u2192R. The situation is very complicated, but a\nglobal minimization is still possible and an \u201cenergy minimal\u201d\nescape trajectory can be found, as shown in Fig. 10. The\ntheoretical path obtained using the actionplot techniques is\nshown as a dashed line. It is compared with the results of a\nMonte Carlo simulation using a noise intensity D=0.02. The\ntwo paths are in almost perfect agreement. The optimal tra-\njectory leaves the initial state along its unstable manifold,\nreaches the boundary, and then drifts in an almost noise-free\nway toward the saddle at \u0001\u22121.88;\u22121.88\u0002. The escape takes\nplace at the saddle point.\nIn order to show that the method described is general, we\ntune the parameters to a particularly interesting regime where\nthe basin boundaries are fractal. Considering a=1.405 and\nb=\u22120.3, the system displays a stable period-2 orbit \u0001xs1 ;xs2\u0002\ncoexisting with a stable attractor at infinity. The boundary of\nthe basin of attraction is fractal and a period-3 accessible\norbit \u000337,51\u0004 is embedded in it. It is an example of locally\ndisconnected fractal boundary \u0001see the discussion in \u000352\u0004 for\nthe classification of fractal boundaries\u0002. The correct math-\nematical definition of this property is the following:\nDefinition 1 (locally disconnected set). A set A is defined\nas locally disconnected if, given a point x in the set, there\nexists a small ball of radius \u0003, such that for every \u0004 a point\ny\u0002A exists for which \u000bx\u2212y\u000b\u0015\u0004 and no connected subset of\nA containing both x and y and lying wholly in the \u0003-ball can\nbe found.\nThe extended system \u000158\u0002 must be solved with the correct\ninitial conditions in a small neighborhood of the period-two\nstable orbit. The trajectories solution of Eq. \u000158\u0002 span a two-\nparameter family on the two-dimensional unstable manifold.\nIn order to provide appropriate initial conditions, the full\nextended system \u000158\u0002 is linearized in the vicinity of one of\nthe points in the stable orbit, for instance xs1. The expanding\nsubspace was calculated using linear analysis, and the matrix\nrelating coordinates and momenta on the manifold were\nworked out.\nAlthough the action plot for the system is again very com-\nplicated, global minimization can be performed to obtain the\nMPEP. The results of the theory agree very well with the\nnumerical output of Monte Carlo simulation as shown in\nFigs. 11 and 12. The escape trajectory leaves the period-two\nstable cycle along the optimal path and reaches the boundary\nthrough the stable manifold of the accessible period-three\norbit. Investigation of the almost noise-free dynamics along\nthe fractal boundary lies beyond the scope of the present\nwork but has been discussed in general terms elsewhere \u000337\u0004.\nIn this section, we have demonstrated the method explic-\nitly for the Henon map, first for a parameter choice corre-\nsponding to a stable period-one orbit and smooth basin\nboundaries and, second, for the more complex case of a\nperiod-two stable orbit and fractal basin boundaries. It is\nclear that the method can be applied in the general case of a\nperiod-n initial orbit: The two-parameter characterization of\ntrajectories still holds, and the procedure described above\nalso applies to the case of a period-n initial state.\nE. Julia map\nWith the following example, we aim to revise the case of\nactivation processes in systems where the fractal basin\nFIG. 10. \u0001Color online\u0002 Comparison of theory and numerical\nsimulations for the escape problem in the Henon map \u0001parameters\nare a=1.1 and b=\u22120.3\u0002.

The mathemati-\ncal definition of a locally connected basin boundary is as\nfollows:\nDefinition 2 (locally connected set). A set A is defined\nconnected if, given a point x in the set and a small ball of\nradius \u0003, around it, a \u0004 such that for every y\u0002A with \u000bx\n\u2212y\u000b\u0015\u0004 there is a connected subset of A containing both x\nand y and lying wholly in the \u0003-ball.\nAn example of this kind of fractal boundary is given by\nthe following analytic map \u000352,51\u0004\nxn+1 = xn\n2\n\u2212 yn\n2 + axn + \u0002xn,\n\u000159\u0002\nyn+1 = 2xnyn + axn + byn + \u0002yn.\nHere xn and yn are two dynamical variables and a and b are\nreal parameters. The two stochastic terms \u0002xn and \u0002yn are\nGaussian and \u0004 correlated with intensity \u0003. Choosing the\nparameter a=0.7 and b=0.5 \u0001a choice made according to\n\u000350\u0004\u0002, the system has a stable fixed point at \u0001x ,y\u0002= \u00010,0\u0002\nwhose basin boundaries are fractal and locally connected. In\nparticular, the basin boundaries are a Julia set \u000353\u0004, histori-\ncally an example of fractals that were investigated by the\nFrench mathematician Gaston Julia \u00011893\u20131978\u0002.\nThe presence of the two noise sources \u0002xn and \u0002yn makes it\npossible to observe transitions from the stable point of Eq.\n\u000159\u0002 to the basin boundary. Previous investigation of the ac-\ntivation process in this system was reported by Grassberger.\nHis analysis was difficult due to the fractal structure of the\nboundaries; in particular, he failed to locate the correct\nboundary conditions.\nUsing the asymptotic approach in the limit of \u0003\u21920, the\nextended map is obtained\nxn+1 = xn\n2\n\u2212 yn\n2 + axn + \bxn, \u000160\u0002\nyn+1 = 2xnyn + axn + byn + \byn,\n\bxn+1 =\n\u00012xn+1 + b\u0002\bxn\nJ\n\u2212\n\u00012yn+1 + a\u0002\byn\nJ\n,\n\byn+1 =\n2yn+1\bxn\nJ\n+\n\u00012xn+1 + a\u0002\byn\nJ\n.\nThe trajectories solution of Eq. \u000160\u0002 forms a two-parameter\nset in the extended four-dimensional space.

We still do not know why the boundary con-\nditions are such.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we have carried out a wide-ranging investi-\ngation of activation processes in complex nonlinear systems\nand maps. The problem has been addressed in the asymptotic\nregime of small noise intensity. In this limit, the features of\nactivation have been investigated using an extended area-\npreserving map for the discrete systems and an auxiliary\nHamiltonian system for continuous flows.\nIn particular, we focused on the solution of boundary\nvalue problems which appear in the context of activation\nthrough a saddle. Difficulties arising in the solution of these\nproblems due to the wild nondifferentiable structure of the\nunstable manifold have been reviewed and tackled. All pos-\nsible escape trajectories have been parametrized using a\nminimal number of parameters and the activation cost has\nbeen calculated as a function of these parameters. Minimiza-\ntion has been performed to calculate the MPEP and the acti-\nvation energy. A graphical presentation of this result was\ndubbed the action plot.\nIt is clear from the structure of the action plot that infi-\nnitely many heteroclinic trajectories lie in a narrow region of\nthe parameter space. This makes it extremely hard to isolate\nthe optimal path among all other heteroclinic trajectories us-\ning only information on the momenta. The action plot pro-\nvides the information required: Besides locating \u0001at least in\nprinciple\u0002 all heteroclinic trajectories in the pattern, it sorts\nthem in a hierarchy and makes it easier to identify the MPEP\namong them. We have shown several examples of qualita-\ntively different systems that can be successfully treated using\nthe action-plot technique, starting from the inverted van der\nPol system as an archetype of an autonomous system with a\nlimit cycle, to the periodically driven overdamped Duffing\noscillator. In order to show the method for maps, the Henon\nmap has been investigated in different ranges of parameters,\ncorresponding to smooth boundaries and locally discon-\nnected fractal boundaries. A quadratic Julia map displaying\nlocally connected fractal boundaries has been also investi-\ngated. In all these cases, the theoretical prediction agrees\nwith the numerical results over a broad range of parameters\nand through several bifurcations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful for valuable discussions with Igor Kho-\nvanov and Suso Kraut.
