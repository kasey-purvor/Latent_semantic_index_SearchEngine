Introduction\n[2] The existence of the Ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n Resonator\n(IAR) was first proposed by Polyakov [1976]. The IAR is a\nvertical structure bounded at either end by partial reflec-\ntors of Alfve\u00b4n waves. The lower boundary lies at around\n100 km altitude, where the Alfve\u00b4n wave frequency matches\nthe ion-neutral collision frequency [Borisov and Stubbe,\n1997]. Strictly speaking the IAR has no definite upper\nboundary, but rather a rapid, but smooth increase in Alfve\u00b4n\nspeed (peaking at \u00017000 km altitude on the nightside and\n13000 km on the dayside [Chaston et al., 2003]) due to a\nswift decrease in plasma density above the ionospheric F\nlayer density peak. This region plays an important role in\nparticle acceleration processes. The characteristic frequen-\ncies of the IAR scale as VAI\/2h, where VAI is the charac-\nteristic ionospheric cavity Alfve\u00b4n speed, and h is the scale\nheight of the cavity (400\u20131200 km [Hebden et al., 2005]).\nMuch theoretical work has been carried out recently in\norder to understand the behaviour and significance of this\nresonant cavity [e.g., Lysak, 1993; Trakhtengerts et al.,\n2000; Chaston et al., 2003]. The theoretical model of the\nIAR of Lysak [1993] has been compared with observations\nof the resonance signatures in the IAR [e.g., Odzimek et al.,\n2004; Hebden et al., 2005].\n[3] The eigenfrequencies of the IAR were first observed\nin 1985, at Nizhny Novgorod, Russia (L\u00012.6), in the form of\nmultiple, horizontally banded spectral resonance structures\n(SRS) in frequency-time plots of mid-latitude magnetic\nbackground noise (0.1\u201310 Hz) in pulsation magnetometer\ndata [Belyaev et al., 1987]. The observations were later\nextended to higher latitudes [Belyaev et al., 1999]. Natural\nIAR resonance features appear as multiple maxima and\nminima in magnetic power spectra, which are stable for\nseveral hours and usually end by fading out or being masked\nby more intense wave activity of magnetospheric origin.\n[4] At auroral latitudes SRS features are regularly\nobserved in high resolution magnetometer data, especially\nat night, however the signatures are often masked by intense\nwave activity associated with auroral processes. Belyaev et\nal. [1990] showed that the frequency and spacing of the\nresonance peaks are inversely related to the critical frequency\nof the F2-layer of the ionosphere (foF2). They are also\nrelated to the size of the resonance cavity and the local\nAlfve\u00b4n speed [Trakhtengerts et al., 2000].\n[5] Recently natural SRS have also been observed in\npulsation magnetometer data from Barentsburg, Svalbard at\nL = 15 [Semenova et al., 2005]. It was found that the\ncharacteristics of SRS at the polar cap were similar to those\nobserved in the auroral zone and that they could be\nexplained by IAR theory.\n[6] Several attempts have been made to create artificial\nmagnetic pulsations using high power radio waves in so\ncalled heating experiments [e.g., Gulielmi et al., 1985;\nStubbe, 1996]. Modulating the frequency of a high power\npump wave will result in the launching of an Alfve\u00b4n wave\nfrom the upper edge of the ionosphere, if certain conditions\nare satisfied. A significant portion of the HF wave energy\nmust be absorbed by the ionosphere and there must be a DC\nelectric field in the absorption layer [Kolesnikova et al.,\n2002]. The pump wave modifies the ionospheric electron\ntemperature and hence collision frequencies in the absorp-\ntion layer, which leads to a local perturbation of the iono-\nspheric conductivity, at the modulation frequency. The\nmagnetic field variations caused by the modulated iono-\nspheric current may be detected at the ground [e.g., Rietveld\net al., 1984]. The presence of the DC electric field results in\nthe generation of a current system, with both field tangential\nand field parallel components. If the parallel current is of\nsufficient magnitude, relative to the other currents in the\nsystem, the associated electric and magnetic field perturba-\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 33, L19103, doi: 10.1029\/2006GL027384, 2006\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n2Sodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory, University of Oulu, Sodankyla\u00a8,\nFinland.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/06\/2006GL027384$05.00\nL19103 1 of 6\ntions result in the formation of an Alfve\u00b4n wave, with the\nsame frequency as the modulation of the pump wave. Such\nmagnetic field variations in the ULF\/ELF\/VLF frequency\nrange have been generated by the high power facility at\nTroms\u00f8, Norway (L = 6\u20137) [Stubbe, 1996].\n[7] It is possible to inject Alfve\u00b4n waves into the IAR, when\nionospheric conditions are favourable, using modulated\nX-mode heating. The resulting wave may be observed as\nan enhancement at the modulation frequency in the dynamic\nspectra of pulsation magnetometer data. If the modulation\nfrequency matches an eigenfrequency of the cavity, reso-\nnance will be achieved and the power of the observed\nenhancement will be significantly larger [Trakhtengerts et\nal., 2000]. Evidence for the artificial excitation of the IAR\nusing the Troms\u00f8 heater has been reported by Bo\u00a8singer et al.\n[2000] and Robinson et al. [2000]. Bo\u00a8singer et al. [2000]\nattempted to excite waves in the 0.1\u20133Hz range, and ob-\nserved the ground signatures of artificial waves during 10%\nof the heating time. They used a variety of stepwise frequency\nsweeps at modulation frequencies between 0.1 and 2 Hz.\nThis method helped to identify the resonant frequencies of\nthe cavity, which showed a higher power response.\n[8] Robinson et al. [2000] injected a 3 Hz ULF wave into\nthe IAR, using the Troms\u00f8 heater. The wave was detected\nfor a short interval by the FAST satellite, as it passed the\nflux tube which mapped to the heater site, at an altitude of\n2550 km. This event has been studied in detail and has been\nreported by Kolesnikova et al. [2002] and Wright et al.\n[2003]. To date it is the only instance of the successful\ndetection of an artificially generated ULF wave at typical\nIAR frequencies in spacecraft data.\n[9] Motivation for the artificial stimulation at the natural\neigenfrequencies of the IAR are threefold. Firstly, stimulating\nIAR resonance provides an excellent opportunity to char-\nacterise the behaviour of the resonant cavity. Secondly,\nwhen combined with other diagnostics such as spacecraft\nparticle detectors, it enables an exploration of the particle\nacceleration processes which occur at the upper boundary of\nthe IAR, where the very high Alfve\u00b4n velocity leads to the\ngeneration of parallel electric fields [Robinson et al., 2000;\nLysak, 1993]. Finally, waves injected into the IAR will\nescape from the upper boundary of the resonator into the\nmagnetosphere, where they may be detected by higher\naltitude spacecraft. At very high latitudes such experiments\nmay reveal the magnetic field geometry in regions of the\nmagnetosphere which are strongly coupled with the inter-\nplanetary medium [Wright et al., 2000].\n[10] On 2 December 2005, from 1800\u20131940 UT, the\nSpace Plasma Exploration by Active Radar (SPEAR) high\npower facility, located near Longyearbyen, Svalbard was\nused to transmit an X-mode 3 Hz modulated square wave, at\n4.45 MHz with a 20 minute on\/off cycle. Observations from\nthe Barentsburg Pulsation Magnetometer (BAR), show\nenhancements in spectral power at 3 Hz during heating.\nIonosonde data show that ionospheric conditions were\nfavourable during this time. These results, which are pre-\nsented in full in section 3 of this paper, are the first\nobservations of heater induced ULF waves at L\u000115. The\noperation of the instruments is briefly described in section 2.\n2. Instrumentation\n2.1. SPEAR\n[11] The SPEAR facility, described in full by Robinson\net al. [2006], is a versatile high-power radar system located\nin the polar cap, at 78.15\u0001 N and 16.05\u0001 E geographic,\naround 10 km from Longyearbyen, Svalbard (Figure 1),\nadjacent to the EISCAT Svalbard Radar site. The SPEAR\nantenna system comprises a 6 \u0002 4 array of full-wave,\nrhombically-broadened, crossed dipoles, with a distributed\nhigh power transmitter system, capable of transmitting a\nsteerable beam of radio waves in the frequency range 4.0\nto 6.0 MHz with up to \u00010.2 MW of RF power at arbitrary\npolarisation, and with a wide variety of modulation fre-\nquencies. Each dipole is connected to a 4 kW transmitter\nwhich is capable of continuous operation, with an antenna\ngain of \u000122 dB and an effective radiated power of up to\n30 MW. The transmitted beam is steered by digitally\nphasing the transmitters. A Canadian Digital Ionosonde\n(CADI) system is collocated with SPEAR. The ionosonde\nis a pulsed system providing 500 W of RF power.\n2.2. Magnetometers\n[12] The BAR Magnetometer has been in operation since\nJuly 2005. At 78.09\u0001N latitude and 14.21\u0001E longitude,\ngeographic, it forms the highest latitude station of the\nFinnish Pulsation Magnetometer Chain. The magnetometer\nis a three-component search coil magnetometer. It is timed\nby a GPS system and the sampling rate of the data is 40 Hz.\nThe IMAGE (International Monitor for Auroral Geomag-\nnetic Effects) [Lu\u00a8hr, 1994] magnetometer network consists\nof 27 magnetometer stations located throughout Scandina-\nvia, covering a geographical latitudinal range of 58\u0001 to 79\u0001.\nEach station uses fluxgate magnetometers to take measure-\nments in three orthogonal directions with a sampling\ninterval of 10 s, and a resolution of 1 nT. The locations of\nthe stations used here are marked on Figure 1.\n3. Observations\n3.1. Heating Experiment\n[13] On 2 Dec 2005, between 1800\u20131940 UT, SPEAR\nwas operated in X-mode in a modulated heating experiment.\nFigure 1. A map showing the locations of the IMAGE\nmagnetometer stations (grey triangles), the Finnish pulsa-\ntion magnetometers (solid black triangles), SPEAR and the\nESR (grey and black triangle), in magnetic coordinates.\nL19103 SCOFFIELD ET AL.: ARTIFICIAL STIMULATION OF THE IAR L19103\n2 of 6\n44 of the 48 SPEAR transmitters were radiating at 4.45 MHz,\neach with a power of \u00012 kW. A 3 Hz modulated square\nwave was transmitted, with a 20 minute on\/off cycle, and an\neffective radiated power of 12 MW. Due to the poor weather\nconditions personnel were not available to run the EISCAT\nSvalbard Radar (ESR). However, the ionospheric conditions\nwere observed by the ionosonde.\n3.2. Ionosonde\n[14] Figure 2 illustrates a series of ionograms from the\nSPEAR ionosonde, which show the changing ionospheric\nconditions during the heating experiment. Each panel\npresents a sample ionogram from sequential SPEAR\n\u2018\u2018off\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 intervals, with the time of each measure-\nment annotated at the top. The actual cadence of the iono-\ngrams was 8 min. At the start of the interval in panels one\nand two, the horizontal band of high power returns, between\n90\u2013130 km virtual height, indicates a substantial E region is\ndetected, extending up to 6 MHz, which is ideal for\nmodulated SPEAR heating, since E region plasma density\nmust be large enough to absorb sufficient HF power to\nlaunch an Alfve\u00b4n wave. The ionogram indicated that the\nE region critical frequency exceeded the SPEAR transmit\nfrequency until 1846 UT, after which the ionosonde signal\nsuffered significant absorption, making it impossible to tell\nwhat the ionospheric conditions were, in the absence of the\nESR (i.e., the ionosonde beam was totally absorbed, rather\nthan being reflected back to the receiver. As a result there\nare no measurements marked on the graphs). This sudden\nabsorption is consistent with the disturbed conditions at that\ntime, which are discussed later. During the final SPEAR\n\u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 evidence of an E region was again present, but by\n1950 UT, during the final SPEAR \u2018\u2018off\u2019\u2019 interval, the\nenhanced E region had disappeared.\n3.3. Pulsation Magnetometer\n[15] Data from the BAR magnetometer are presented in\ndynamic spectral form in Figure 3. H and D component\ndata are plotted in Figures 3a and 3b respectively. Each\ndata point plotted represents the mean of 20 Fourier\nFigure 2. Summary plot of ionograms from the SPEAR Ionosonde. In each plot the x-axis is a logarithmic scale of\nfrequency in MHz, covering the range 1\u201310 MHz, and the y-axis shows virtual height, covering 80\u2013410 km. The colour\nscale shows power in dB, ranging from 0 (blue) to 33 (red) dB. One ionogram is taken for each SPEAR \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019\ninterval, as numbered, corresponding to the intervals defined in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. A summary plot of BAR pulsation magnet-\nometer data. (a and b) Fourier power of data at frequencies\nbetween 0.5 and 5.0 Hz as a fraction of the peak power at\n3 Hz as it varies with time. Each pixel represents an average\nof 20 unique spectra, each calculated from a 1024 point\n(25.6 seconds) window with a 256 point (6.4 seconds) slip\nbetween pixels. This gives a time resolution of 6.4 seconds\nand a frequency resolution of 0.04 Hz. Figure 3a shows\nH component data while Figure 3b shows D component\ndata. The D component peak was 1.6 times the magnitude\nof the H component peak. The bar at the top of the figure\nand the vertical dashed lines indicate when the heater was\nturned on (red). (c and d) Variation of Fourier power,\nsummed between 2.9 and 3.1 Hz, with time. Figure 3c shows\nH component data and Figure 3d shows D component data.\nL19103 SCOFFIELD ET AL.: ARTIFICIAL STIMULATION OF THE IAR L19103\n3 of 6\nspectra, created from consecutive, independent 25.6 second\n(1024 point) spectral windows centred at that time. The slip\ndistance between data points is 6.4 seconds (256 points).\nTaking such an average of 20 spectrum helps to eliminate\nuncorrelated noise in the individual spectra, whilst high-\nlighting the persistent features such as SRS. The frequency\nresolution of the dynamic spectra is 0.04 Hz. Dynamic\nspectra are often dominated by Pc 1 wave activity which\nmasks SRS in the IAR. In order to draw out SRS features\neach spectrum was filtered in the frequency domain. The\nmean power of each spectrum was removed and a Lanczos\nsquared filter, with a high frequency cutoff of 1.0 Hz and a\nlow frequency cutoff of 0.2 Hz was used. The colour scale\nshows the Fourier power as a fraction of the maximum\npower observed at 3 Hz during the interval. The bar at the top\nof Figure 3 and the vertical dashed lines indicate the times\nwhen SPEAR was turned on. The red shading of the bar\nindicated on and the blue shading indicates off, with the\nintervals labelled 1 to 7. The horizontal white lines mark the\nfrequencies 2.9 Hz and 3.1 Hz. If the ionospheric conditions\nare favourable one might expect to see an enhancement in\npower at 3 Hz during the times when SPEAR is turned on\n(intervals 2, 4, and 6). Indeed there is an enhancement of the\nD component during interval 2 between 1800\u20131820 UT and\nalso during interval 6 between 1920\u20131940 UT. However\nduring interval 4 (1840\u20131900 UT) the conditions become\nquite disturbed and the spectra are swamped by Pc 1 wave\nactivity. This coincides with the total absorption of the\nionosonde beam noted above. No D component enhance-\nment at 3 Hz is observed during this interval, but such an\nenhancement is seen in the H component.\n[16] Figures 3c and 3d show time series calculated from\nthe sum of the Fourier power between 2.9 and 3.1 Hz (i.e.,\nbetween the horizontal black lines in Figures 3a and 3b).\nFigure 3c shows the H component data and Figure 3d shows\nthe D component data. The shaded bars and vertical lines\nagain indicate the intervals where SPEAR is turned on.\nEnhancements in the 3 Hz \u00b1 0.1 Hz power occur during the\nheated intervals, in the D component for intervals 2 and 6\nand in the H component for interval 4. Natural enhance-\nments also occurred outside these times, although they were\nof lower spectral power.\n3.4. Fluxgate Magnetometers\n[17] Figure 4 presents data from selected stations of the\nIMAGE fluxgate magnetometer network. All stations show\na sudden magnetic field disturbance, indicative of substorm\nactivity, occurring first in the lower latitude stations, at 64\u0001\ngeomagnetic latitude at 1800 UT, and subsequently propa-\ngating poleward up to and beyond the latitude of BAR (76\u0001\ngeomagnetic) at \u00011830 UT. This corresponds to the ab-\nsorption of the ionosonde signal and the increase in Pc 1\nactivity observed by the BAR magnetometer.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n[18] During the interval under investigation there were\nthree periods of 20 minutes duration when modulated\nionospheric modification was carried out, separated by\n20 minute intervals. During the first SPEAR \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019\n(interval 2) the ionospheric conditions were favourable\nfor a strong interaction between the SPEAR pump wave\nand the D and E regions of the ionosphere (60 km\u2013130 km\naltitude), resulting in a 3 Hz modulation of the ionospheric\ncurrent systems. An enhancement of the 3 Hz spectral\npower is observed in the pulsation magnetometer data\nD component at this time. This enhancement may indicate\nartificial stimulation of the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator at\nor near one of the harmonics of its resonant frequency,\nhowever improved stimulation efficiency may also be due\nto improved ionospheric conditions. No enhancement is\nobserved in the H component [e.g., Molchanov et al.,\n2004]. This however, is not entirely unexpected since\npervious observations have suggested that SRS signatures\ntypically have a larger amplitude in the D component than\nin the H component [e.g., Molchanov et al., 2004].\nFigure 4. Summary plot of IMAGE data: (right) X-component (northward) data and (left) y-component (eastwards) data.\nThe data are plotted in order of descending magnetic latitude.\nL19103 SCOFFIELD ET AL.: ARTIFICIAL STIMULATION OF THE IAR L19103\n4 of 6\n[19] During the second SPEAR \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 (interval 4) the\nionospheric conditions were more disturbed. The ionograms\nfrom this period show that the ionosonde signal has been\ncompletely absorbed, suggesting a sudden increase in D and\nE region plasma density. Such conditions should also be\nfavourable for a strong interaction between the SPEAR\npump wave and the lower ionosphere, although no mea-\nsurement of the critical frequency in the lower ionosphere is\navailable. The IMAGE magnetometer data show a distur-\nbance in the geomagnetic field at all stations, indicative of\nsubstorm activity. The dynamic spectra of the pulsation\nmagnetometer data (Figures 3a and 3b) show an increase in\nnatural Pc 1 wave activity at frequencies between 0.5\u2013\n1.5 Hz, which is likely to be related to the disturbances\nobserved in the IMAGE data. It is common for such activity\nto obscure natural SRS signatures in the Fourier power\nspectra, due to the comparatively low power of SRS. No\nenhancement is observed in the spectral power of the D\ncomponent pulsation magnetometer data at this time, how-\never there is a small enhancement in the H component at\n3 Hz, visible in Figure 3a. There are also enhancements at\nother frequencies during this heater interval, at \u00012.25 Hz and\n\u00013.75 Hz, and to a lesser extent at \u00011.5 Hz and \u00010.75 Hz.\nThis may suggest some short term excitement of waves at\nthe IAR eigenfrequencies by a broadband source. If so, then\nthey are short-lived. Such enhancements in the ionospheric\nplasma density might also be expected to change the\nresonant frequencies of the IAR. Banded structures are also\nobserved in the D component during this interval, however\nthey are at frequencies of 0.9 Hz, 1.25, 1.6, and 1.95 Hz and\nare of lower amplitude.\n[20] During the 3rd SPEAR \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 (interval 6) the iono-\nspheric conditions have returned to something more similar\nto those observed during interval 2. An enhancement is\nagain observed in the spectral power of the D component of\nthe pulsation magnetometer data, at 3 Hz. Figures 3c and 3d\nshow that there is also a small enhancement in the 3 Hz\nspectral power in the H component, which may indicate\nresonance in the IAR.\n[21] Although several other X-mode modulated heating\nexperiments were carried out during the same two-week\nSPEAR heating campaign, the interval presented here was\nthe only one where ionospheric conditions appeared favour-\nable and where stimulation of the IAR was successful. It\nshould be noted that for this interval there is some power in\nthe dynamic spectra (Figure 3b) at, or around, 3 Hz during\ninterval 1, prior to the heating, perhaps indicating that 3 Hz\nwas a favourable frequency for the modulation experiment,\nbeing close to an existing eigenfrequency of the IAR.\nHowever, no signatures clear enough to have been indepen-\ndently identified as natural SRS were observed.\n[22] It is also not clear why the polarization of the\nartificially stimulated wave should shift from D to H during\nintervals 3\u20135. For natural waves it is thought that polariza-\ntion is related to the source of the resonance. However in\nthis case the source is the same. It is possible that the\npolarization of the oscillation is related to the background\nionospheric electric fields, which have been altered by the\ndisturbed conditions during intervals 3\u20135. The magnetic\nfield changes measured by IMAGE (a sharp change in the\nX component indicating a rotation of the ionospheric\nelectric field as a westward electrojet is established) are\nconsistent with this interpretation, but further study of\nsimilar events is required to clarify this matter.\n[23] The results presented here have shown for the first\ntime that it is possible to artificially excite ULF waves at\n3 Hz, through artificial stimulation of the IAR with mod-\nulated X-mode heating, at 78\u0001 N (L\u000115). However it is not\nclear whether the artificial waves were at an eigenfrequency\nof the cavity. In future real time processing of the BAR data\nwill enable the selection of heater frequencies, which\ncorrespond to the eigenfrequencies of the IAR, as observed\nfrom natural SRS signatures. Coordination of such experi-\nments with satellite overpasses and operation of the ESR,\nshould then allow the investigation of the injection of such\nartificially-stimulated waves into the magnetosphere, hence\na determination of the magnetic field geometry of the\noverlying magnetosphere and exploration of associated\nparticle acceleration processes.\n[24] Acknowledgments.
