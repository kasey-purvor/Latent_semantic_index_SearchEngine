Meteorology and atmospheric dynamics (Mid-\ndle atmosphere dynamics; Polar meteorology; Waves and\ntides)\n1 Introduction\nExamination of the correlation between the tide and plan-\netary waves (PWs) is an important issue for understanding\npossible sources of the tidal amplitude variability. Presently,\nsuch a relationship can be physically interpreted as the\nnonlinear interaction between the migrating tide (MT) and\n(quasi-) stationary planetary wave (SPW), which produces\nthe non-migrating tides (NMT) (e.g. Hagan and Roble, 2001;\nAngelats i Coll and Forbes, 2002; Manson et al., 2009).\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n4240 X. Xu et al.: Variability of the semidiurnal tide and quasi-stationary planetary waves\nNon-migrating tides have been found to be non-negligible\nat high latitudes in model studies (Miyahara and Miyoshi,\n1997; Miyahara et al., 1999; Yamashita et al., 2002). Ear-\nlier observational studies for non-migrating tides were cen-\ntered on the South Pole (Hernandez et al., 1993; Forbes et\nal., 1995; Portnyagin et al., 1998). Hernandez et al. (1993)\nused OH emissions for several winter-years to identify a 12-\nh oscillation of s=1 over the South Pole. A meteor radar at\n90\u25e6 S that used orthogonal antennas provided confirmation\nof a 12-h NMT with s=1, and their preference for process\nwas non-linear interactions with the local summer SPW with\nS=1 (SPW1) (Forbes et al., 1995). The s=1 semidiurnal tide\n(SDT) occurs most often during austral summer. With the\n90\u25e6 S data and radar data from Scott Base (78\u25e6 S), Molodezh-\nnaya (68\u25e6 S) and Mawson (67\u25e6 S), Portnyagin et al. (1998)\nfound that at the South Pole the 12-h oscillations were con-\nsistent with a NMT of s=1 for spring-summer months. Away\nfrom the pole, the 12-h oscillation at Scott Base (78\u25e6 S) was\nalso consistent with a dominant NMT of s=1 and shared\nspring-summer maximum amplitudes with the South Pole.\nIn contrast, at\u223c70\u25e6 S the semidiurnal tides (SDTs) had max-\nimum equinoctial amplitudes and a mixture of MT (s=2) and\nNMT (s=1) was suggested. Consistent with this, the stud-\nies by Riggin et al. (1999) and Portnyagin et al. (2000) con-\ncluded that the s=1 semidiurnal oscillation observed at the\nSouth Pole during austral summer may extend equatorward\nto somewhat lower latitudes (\u223c80\u25e6 S). And Murphy (2002)\nhas also showed that a combination of s=1 and s=2 modes\nmight explain rapid fluctuations in the phase of the 12-h com-\nponent of MF radar winds observed at Davis (69\u25e6 S, 78\u25e6 E).\nMost recently, Murphy et al. (2006) used several Antarctic\nradars to identify a dominant semidiurnal NMT of s=1 (and\na lesser s=0) during Southern Hemisphere (SH) summer-\nequinox months (October\u2013March). The regional average lat-\nitude was 69\u25e6 S. Based on four years of radar wind data from\nHalley (76\u25e6 S, 26\u25e6 W) and Scott Base (78\u25e6 S, 167\u25e6 E), Baum-\ngaertner et al. (2006) demonstrated that the s=1 SDT is often\ndominant in summer, while in winter a mixture of s=1 and\ns=2 is found.\nThe situation in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is shown\nto be different. Manson et al. (2009), based upon analysis of\nthe Svalbard and Eureka tides during 2006\/2007, showed that\nat latitudes near 80\u25e6 N the semidiurnal MT (s=2) is dominant\nin summer, while the semidiurnal NMT with s=1 and s=3 oc-\ncur most often during equinoctial or early summer months.\nPortnyagin et al. (2004) examined the slopes of the tidal\nphases (time of maximum in UT) versus longitudes and con-\ncluded that in the southern Arctic (65\u201375\u25e6 N) the migrating\ntides are dominant for both diurnal and semidiurnal oscilla-\ntions during all months, but with some indications of NMT in\nMay\u2013June. Riggin et al. (2003) also showed that during the\nsummer-early fall months (June\u2013September) the SDT at the\nlatitudes of Andenes (69\u25e6 N, 16\u25e6 E) and Poker Flat (65\u25e6 N,\n147\u25e6 W) usually has a zonal wave number 2 (MT) struc-\nture. Forbes and Wu (2006) discussed the global tidal field\n(70\u25e6 S\u201370\u25e6 N) using temperatures from UARS-MLS (1991\u2013\n1997) at heights of 25\u201386 km and suggested minimal pres-\nence of semidiurnal s=1 thermal tide at high northern lat-\nitudes (their Fig. 11), although the latitudinal structures of\nNMT and \u201cexpansion functions\u201d for winds and temperature\ndo differ. Manson et al. (2004a) concluded that the semidi-\nurnal NMT was weak compared with the semidiurnal MT in\nsummer and fall for latitudes near 70\u25e6 N using HRDI-UARS\nwind data near 95 km. For the mid-latitudes (\u223c40\u25e6 N) and at\naltitudes above 80 km, the migrating SDT dominates in the\nregion of late-summer\/fall maximum amplitude (Manson et\nal., 2006). Overall, the non-migrating tides in the SH are\nclearly stronger than in the NH during the summer months\nof each hemisphere. Aso (2007) also suggested that a hemi-\nspheric asymmetry might then exist in the seasonal variations\nof the semidiurnal NMT s=1 after discussing the asymmetry\nof the SPW1 activity between the NH and SH.\nThere is growing evidence in recent years for the inter-\nhemispheric SPW-tidal connections. The model study of Ya-\nmashita et al. (2002) verified that the nonlinear interaction\nforcing between the SPW1 and the migrating SDT could pro-\nvide the non-migrating SDT (s=1). Their related calculations\nwith this tide indicated that, once excited in the NH winter\nhemisphere, it could propagate to the polar mesosphere and\nlower thermosphere (MLT) region of the SH and result in the\nlocal summer enhancement of the s=1 SDT. Recently, Aso\n(2007) assessed the semidiurnal NMT at polar latitudes us-\ning a linearized steady and explicit tidal model and confirmed\nthe trans-equatorial propagation of the 12-h NMT with s=1,\nwhich is forced in the opposite winter hemisphere. Baum-\ngaertner et al. (2005) compared the seasonal sequences of\nplanetary wave amplitudes with amplitudes of the SDT at\nScott Base (78\u25e6 S, 167\u25e6 E) and pointed out that planetary\nwaves in both the SH and NH are partly responsible for the\nseasonal variability of the SH semidiurnal tide via the gener-\nation of a s=1 SDT. Based on observations using two radars,\nlocated at Scott Base and at Halley (76\u25e6 S, 26\u25e6 W), Baum-\ngaertner et al. (2006) further showed that the amplitudes of\nthe semidiurnal NMT (s=1) were positively correlated with\nthe NH SPW1 near 1 hPa during the SH summer months, but\nalso with the SH SPW1 near 10 hPa during the SH winter\nperiod. During the reviewing process of this paper, it was\nlearned that Murphy et al. (2009) has used amplitudes of the\nSH semidiurnal NMT s=1 and 3 during summer and early\nfall, obtained from 4 radars, to demonstrate correlations with\nthe global planetary wave (S=1) and hence source regions in\nthe NH. Thus these new results are consistent with those of\nBaumgaertner et al. (2005, 2006), who used two radars, as is\nour situation in the NH.\nRecently, Smith et al. (2007) found a correlation between\nvariability of the mesospheric SDT at Esrange (68\u25e6 N, 21\u25e6 E)\nand the amplitude of planetary wave number S=1 (PW1,\nquasi-stationary) in the SH stratosphere and lower meso-\nsphere during NH summer and fall. Based on their hypothe-\nsis, the correlation implied that the non-migrating tide had\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 4239\u20134256, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4239\/2009\/\nX. Xu et al.: Variability of the semidiurnal tide and quasi-stationary planetary waves 4241\na significant contribution to the tidal variability observed\nat Esrange and that the autumn enhancement of the Es-\nrange SDT was associated with the growth of the SH PW.\nTheir interpretation is that the PW in the SH interacts with\nthe global semidiurnal migrating tide and produces non-\nmigrating semidiurnal tides that vary in time in concert with\nthe SH PW.\nAlthough the differences between the observed tidal am-\nplitudes and the predictions of the Global Scale Wave Model\n(GSWM) for summer-autumn may indicate the presence of\nnom-migrating tides at Esrange (Mitchell et al., 2002), the\nmigrating SDT usually dominates for nearly all months in\nthe latitudes of \u223c70\u25e6 N in the MLT region based on the de-\nscriptions given earlier. In particular the strong early-autumn\nenhancement at mid-high northern latitudes is definitely the\ncharacteristic of the migrating SDT (Riggin et al., 2003)\nwhich experiences favourable winds and refractive indices\nat these times. Hence, doubts have been cast on the physical\nsignificance for the correlations found by Smith et al. (2007).\nOn the other hand, the Pearson correlation coefficient is a\nmeasure of a linear relationship integrated over an interval\nand over all frequencies; information on the temporal depen-\ndence of variables and time scales relevant to correlations\ncannot be seen in this integrated analysis. We know that both\nthe SPW and tidal sequences have strong seasonality. The\nstrong seasonality would easily lead to a high correlation co-\nefficient, even though the physical relationship between the\ntwo variables is not real. Therefore, the question, of whether\nthe correlations found by Smith et al. (2007) implied SPW-\ntidal nonlinear interactions or were induced by the numer-\nical problems of seasonal trend, comes up. Further, if the\ncorrelation implies that the non-migrating component con-\ntributes a significant part to the tidal variability at \u223c70\u25e6 N,\nthe non-migrating tides could be stronger and even dominate\nat Arctic latitudes (\u223c80\u25e6 N) and could be weaker at lower lat-\nitudes (\u223c50\u25e6 N) based upon the Antarctic data as discussed\nabove. Then the observed tidal amplitudes at appropriate\nlongitudes at Arctic latitudes (lower latitudes) would have\nstronger (weaker) correlations with the SH SPW amplitudes.\nThe aim of this paper is to clarify this question by further\nanalysis of the relationship between the variability of the\nSDT in the NH mesosphere and the global SPW1 amplitudes\nwith considerations of the longitudinal and latitudinal varia-\ntions of the SDT.\nHere the SDT data are derived using medium frequency\nradars (MFR) at Saskatoon (52\u25e6 N, 253\u25e6 E), Troms\u00f8 (70\u25e6 N,\n19\u25e6 E), and meteor radars (MWR) at Collm (51\u25e6 N, 13\u25e6 E),\nEureka (80\u25e6 N, 86\u25e6 W) and Svalbard (78\u25e6 N, 16\u25e6 E). The rel-\native importance of migrating and non-migrating SDTs at\npolar latitudes and at high mid-latitudes is estimated based\nupon the observations from the Svalbard-Eureka pair and\nthe Collm-Saskatoon pair. The Aura-MLS temperature mea-\nsurements with near global view (latitude coverage 82\u25e6 S\u2013\n82\u25e6 N) are used to construct the global stationary planetary\nwave field. The data and analysis technique are briefly de-\nscribed in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 and Sect. 4 the tidal variability\nis compared with the SPW throughout the global middle at-\nmosphere. Section 5 simply discusses the time scale relevant\nto the correlation. Finally a discussion and summary will be\nmade in Sect. 6, followed by conclusions in Sect. 7.\n2 Data description and analysis technique\n2.1 Radar data\nThe tidal data for this study are taken from MF radars at\nSaskatoon (52\u25e6 N, 253\u25e6 E), Troms\u00f8 (70\u25e6 N, 19\u25e6 E), and me-\nteor radars at Collm (51\u25e6 N, 13\u25e6 E), Eureka (80\u25e6 N, 86\u25e6 W)\nand Svalbard (78\u25e6 N, 16\u25e6 E). A detailed description of these\nradars can be found in Chshyolkova et al. (2007) and Man-\nson et al. (2009). In this study, the radar data are usually\nanalysed at 6 height levels centered on 82, 85, 88, 91, 94 and\n97 km. The semidiurnal tides are obtained by a least-squares\nfit of the mean, 48-, 24-, 12-, 8- and 6-h components to the\nhourly mean radar measurements. The fitting uses a window\nof 4 days shifted by 1 day. It is required that for each fit\nthere be data for 16 or more local hours out of 24 for each\nheight over the window. Tides at 85, 91, 97 km are usually\nsimilar to tides at 82, 88 and 94 km, respectively. In addition,\nthe difference between the meridional (NS) and zonal (EW)\ncomponents is small for the SDT amplitude (e.g. Manson et\nal., 2009). Hence, to save space, only analyses related to\nthe meridional (NS) semidiurnal tides (SDTs) at 82, 88 and\n94 km are shown in this study.\nWith two sites at similar latitudes and widely separated\nlongitudes, it is possible to solve for the amplitude and phase\nof two tides (e.g. Baumgaertner et al., 2006; Manson et al.,\n2009). Assuming one of the two tides is a migrating tide (s=2\nfor the SDT), and that the forcing of the NMT near 80\u25e6 N is\ndue to wave numbers S=1 or 2, pairs of the MT and chosen\nNMT values were calculated (Manson et al., 2009). The lati-\ntude difference between Svalbard and Eureka is about 2 deg,\nallowing us to fit a migrating and non-migrating tide with a\ngiven wavenumber to the data from these two sites. The same\nis true for the Collm-Saskatoon pair. Manson et al.

The data are available starting in August 2004 and have\nlatitude coverage from 82\u25e6 S to 82\u25e6 N. The useful altitude\nrange is 316\u20130.001 hPa (\u223c8\u201397 km) with precision ranging\nfrom 0.6 K in the lower stratosphere to 2.5 K in the meso-\nsphere. More information on Aura-MLS data was provided\nin Chshyolkova et al. (2007). In this paper, the temperatures\nare sorted into cells with 5\u25e6 width in latitude and 20\u25e6 width\nin longitude. The SPW field is then constructed by a Fourier\nanalysis on a window of 4 days shifted by 1 day, which is\nconsistent with the tidal analyses. This technique is reason-\nable and reliable for the stratosphere and lower mesosphere\ngiven the negligible aliasing effect from non-migrating tides.\nNote the PW1 is usually shown as being quasi-stationary in\nboth hemispheres (Leovy and Webster, 1976).\n3 Correlation analyses between the SH SPW1 and NH\nSDT amplitudes during NH summer-fall\nThis section will present the height-latitude contour plots\nof the linear correlation coefficient (also called the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient) for the SPW1 amplitudes through-\nout the global (82\u25e6 S\u201382\u25e6 N) stratosphere and mesosphere\nwith respect to the meridional SDT amplitudes in the NH\nmesosphere during two 120-day NH summer\u2013fall seasons\n(days 181\u2013300; 30 June\u201327 October, 2006 and 2007). A\nsummer\u2013fall interval is chosen because the PW activities for\nthe SH occur most often during these months. The sequence\nof SDT amplitude is kept constant for each contour plot. Al-\nthough the plots are shown in global latitudes, the correla-\ntions in the SH (the opposite hemisphere relative to the tides\nused) high-latitude stratosphere and lower mesosphere are\nprimarily discussed. The NH results are not discussed due\nto little SPW activity in the NH for July\u2013September. Since\neach time sequence is obtained over a window of 4 days that\nis stepped by 1 day, the successive data points are not inde-\npendent, thus reducing the degrees of freedom. In this pa-\nper, a Monte-Carlo shuffling method (e.g. Ebisuzaki, 1997;\nUsoskin et al., 2006) is applied to estimate the significance\nof correlation. This spectral method ensures that the signifi-\ncances are appropriate to the degrees of freedom existing in\neach of the time sequences and hence correlations.\n3.1 SH SPW1 versus SDT at \u223c80\u25e6 N\nFigure 1 shows the correlations between the meridional SDT\namplitudes observed at Svalbard (78\u25e6 N, 16\u25e6 E) and Eureka\n(80\u25e6 N, 86\u25e6 W) with the SPW1 amplitudes throughout the\nglobal middle atmosphere for 30 June\u201327 October, 2006 and\n2007. The top sections of Fig. 2 present the time sequences\nof 88 km and 94 km tidal amplitudes at Svalbard and Eureka\ncompared with the SPW1 amplitudes at 10 hPa, 60\u201365\u25e6 S and\nat 10 hPa, 55\u201360\u25e6 N during season 2006\/2007.\nThe SPW1 amplitudes in the stratosphere at the SH high\nlatitudes generally show weak positive correlations with the\nmeridional SDT amplitude at 82 km observed at Svalbard\nduring summer\u2013fall of 2006 (Fig. 1a). Similar correlation\npatterns are found with respect to the tide at 88 km, although\nthe values are even weaker (Fig. 1b). Correspondingly, the\nSvalbard meridional SDT amplitude at 88 km attains a maxi-\nmum in September, while the simultaneous SPW1 amplitude\nin the opposite hemisphere is not large (e.g. red versus black\nin Fig. 2a). This weakens the correlations between them and\nalso indicates that this autumn intensification of the Sval-\nbard SDT is not associated with the SH SPW1 activity. As\nopposite to the 82 km and 88 km tides, the Svalbard 94 km\nSDT amplitudes show strong negative correlations with the\nSPW1 amplitudes in the high-latitude southern stratosphere\n(Fig. 1c). However, notice that these negative correlations are\nstatistical artifacts, caused by trends. Figure 2c indicates the\nopposite seasonal trends between the 94 km Svalbard SDT\namplitudes and the SPW1 amplitude at 10 hPa, 60\u201365\u25e6 S: the\nformer is larger in July\u2013September than in October (black\nin Fig. 2c) while the SPW1 is weaker in July\u2013August than in\nSeptember\u2013October (red in Fig. 2c).

The percentage-power in the\nmigrating SDT derived from the Svalbard-Eureka pair is shown in the lower sections of the figure (solid lines, e\u2013g).\nSDT amplitudes for 88 km is clearly a characteristic of the\nmigrating SDT, with the power of MT values close to 100%\n(Fig. 2f). The presence of non-migrating SDT for the up-\nper heights during the equinoctial time (October) is likely to\nbe a result of the global forcing of NMT by the SPW (Man-\nson et al., 2009) since the October SPW activities in both\nhemispheres are often comparable (e.g. red versus purple in\nFig. 2).\nMoving to the 2007 summer-fall, the stratospheric SPW1\namplitudes in the SH high latitudes do not provide positive\ncorrelations beyond 95% significance level with the Svalbard\nmeridional SDT amplitudes (Fig. 1g\u2013i). Similarly, the Eu-\nreka meridional SDT amplitude at 82 km is not correlated\nwith the SH SPW1 amplitudes (Fig. 1j). The 88 km tide is\nshown to be positively correlated only with the SPW1 am-\nplitudes in the lower mesosphere at high southern latitudes\n(Fig. 1k). Similar SH correlation patterns are found for the\nEureka tide at 94 km, although the correlations are further\nweakened (Fig. 1l). The time sequences of the % power of\nthe migrating SDT (not shown for 2007\/2008) also indicates\nthat at 80\u25e6 N the migrating SDT plays a more important role\nat most times for the 3 heights during 2007\/2008.\nOverall, during these two summer-fall seasons (Fig. 1), the\nmesospheric SDT amplitudes observed at the NH polar lat-\nitudes (\u223c80\u25e6 N) usually do not show persistent significant\ncorrelations with the SPW1 amplitudes in the high-latitude\nsouthern stratosphere.

At the lati-\ntudes of \u223c70\u25e6 N, there are currently no suitable\/continuous\nmesospheric wind observations available in the Pacific-\nCanada longitudinal sector. So the relative importance of mi-\ngrating and non-migrating tides cannot be directly analysed\nfor this latitude band. Further, the existence of significant\ncorrelations, positive or negative, will depend not only upon\nthe existence of NMT during the intervals assessed, but also\nwhether Troms\u00f8 lies (by chance) within the longitudes where\nthe MT and the NMT interfere constructively or destructively\n(Sect. 6, Discussion).\nFigure 3 shows the correlation for the SPW1 amplitude\nwith respect to the Troms\u00f8 NS SDT amplitude as a function\nof global latitude and height for two 120-day summer-fall\nseasons (30 June\u201327 October, 2006 and 2007). The correla-\ntions for the SPW1 amplitudes with the Troms\u00f8 tidal ampli-\ntude (Fig. 3a\u2013c) are similar to those with the Svalbard tide\n(Fig. 1a\u2013c) during the 2006 summer-fall.

Examination of\ntime sequences (not shown here) reveals that the correlation\nis provided mainly by the variability over time-scales of\u223c30\ndays or more.\n3.3 SH SPW1 versus SDT at \u223c50\u25e6 N\nIn this subsection, the mesospheric NS SDT amplitudes mea-\nsured by the Collm (51\u25e6 N, 13\u25e6 E) MWR and Saskatoon\n(52\u25e6 N, 253\u25e6 E) MFR are chosen to be correlated with the\nglobal SPW1 amplitudes in the stratosphere and mesosphere.\nFigure 4 displays the correlations respectively for the two\nsummer-fall intervals.\nWe do not see significant and positive correlations be-\ntween the Collm meridional SDT amplitude and strato-\nspheric SPW1 amplitudes in high southern latitudes during\nthe 2006 summer-fall for the 3 tidal heights (Fig. 4a\u2013c). In\ncontrast, the meridional SDT amplitudes observed at Saska-\ntoon seem to be well correlated with the SPW1 amplitudes\nin high latitude southern stratosphere and lower mesosphere\nduring the 2006 summer-fall interval (Fig. 4d\u2013f). Two max-\nima of correlation are clearly observed in high southern lat-\nitudes with one between 100\u20132 hPa and the other around\n0.1 hPa. These high correlations are due to the general\nagreement between long-term variations of the two variables,\nincluding strong trends during the months of September\u2013\nOctober. We have also calculated lagged correlation coef-\nficient between the two variables (not shown) and find that\nthese strong positive correlations in the SH high latitudes al-\nways exist for time-lags ranging from \u223c+10 to \u221210 days.\nThis also indicates that these correlations are dominated by\nthe low frequency variability in the sequences.\nLike the Svalbard-Eureka pair, the Collm MWR-\nSaskatoon MFR pair also allows us to estimate the relative\nimportance of the MT\/NMT. The wind speed-bias between\nMFR and MWR varies with height and season, smaller for\nlower mesospheric heights and summer and larger for upper\nmesospheric altitudes and winter (Manson et al., 2004c; Hall\net al., 2005; Jacobi et al., 2009). So for the upper meso-\nsphere and winter, the bias could produce artificial NMT. To\nreduce the effect of the MFR\/MWR bias, the Collm-MWR\nwinds at 94 km are multiplied by a factor of 0.5 (0.8) for\nthe winter (summer) months; the MWR winds at 88 km are\nmultiplied by a factor of 0.8 for the winter months. The\nratio values are derived from the study of Jacobi (2009)\nthat compared Collm MWR with Juliusruh (55\u25e6 N, 13\u25e6 E)\nMFR winds. Figure 5 provides the time sequences of the\npercentage-power of migrating NS SDT that are determined\nfrom the Collm-Saskatoon pair for season 2006\/2007. At\n51\/52\u25e6 N, the dominance of the MT occurred nearly through-\nout the whole season 2006\/2007 for the 3 heights (Fig. 5a\u2013\nc), except for October\u2013November. The late-summer\/early-\nautumn enhancement in the SDT amplitude is predominately\na characteristic of the migrating tide.\nFor the 2007 summer-fall, the Collm tidal amplitudes are\nshown to be positively correlated with the SPW1 around\n10 hPa, 65\u25e6 S (Fig. 4g\u2013i). These positive correlations are\nstrongest in the case of the 88 km tidal height (Fig. 4h). Fig-\nure 6 presents the time sequences of the 88 km SDT am-\nplitudes observed at Collm and Saskatoon, along with the\nSPW1 amplitudes at 10 hPa, 65\u201370\u25e6 S and at 31.6 hPa, 50\u2013\n55\u25e6 N during 2007\/2008. We can see that the Collm 88 km\ntidal amplitude varies in correlation with the SPW1 ampli-\ntude at 10 hPa, 65\u201370\u25e6 S on monthly time scales from mid-\nJuly to mid-October (black vs. red in Fig. 6a). However, no-\ntice that the Collm tides are also relatively large and vari-\nable in June and July, when the global SPW1 amplitudes\nand variability are quite minimal. Similar to during the\n2006 summer-fall, the Saskatoon NS SDT amplitudes at the\n3 heights are all shown to be significantly and positively\ncorrelated with the SPW1 amplitudes between 100\u20133 hPa\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4239\/2009\/ Ann.

These correlations are domi-\nnated by the similarity between the long term (monthly time-\nscales) variations for the amplitudes of the tides and SH\nSPW1 (e.g. black vs. red in Fig. 6b). Hence, these correla-\ntions also occur over a wide range of time-lags (not shown).\nTime sequences of the percentage-power of the migrating\nSDT, as obtained from the Collm-Saskatoon pair for sea-\nson 2007\/2008, are also shown in Fig. 6. Apparently, in the\nNH high mid-latitudes (\u223c50\u25e6 N), the migrating (s=2) SDT\ndominates during all summer-autumn months for the 3 MLT\nheights. The exception is the relative dominance of the non-\nmigrating SDT in October 2007. The MT is usually much\nstronger or dominant (100%) over the NMT during August\u2013\nSeptember when both the Collm and Saskatoon SDT ampli-\ntudes are large. Note that in October 2007 the SPW activities\nin both hemispheres (e.g. red and purple in Fig. 6) are proba-\nbly responsible for what we claim to be the dominance of the\nNMT by the global forcing, although this has a weak effect\non the 120-day correlation between the observed SDT and\nthe SH SPW1.\nNotice that strong correlations (positive and negative) ap-\npearing in the NH in Figs. 1, 3 and 4 apparently have no\nphysical meaning: they are statistical artefacts caused by the\ntrends relative to the NH SPW1 transition from the early au-\ntumn into the early winter (e.g. purple in Figs. 2 and 6), and\nthe characteristic late summer\/early autumn variability of the\ntides, the latter associated with seasonal\/altitudinal changes\nin tidal Hough-mode composition of the MT (Riggin et al.,\n2003; Manson et al., 2006).\n4 Correlation analyses between the NH SPW1 and NH\nSDT amplitudes during NH winter\nThis section presents the correlation analyses similar to those\nin Sect. 3, but for two 120-day NH winters (days 311\u2013430;\n7 November\u20136 March 2006\/2007 and 7 November\u20135 March\n2007\/2008).

The extraction and use of zonal\nwavenumber components would clearly be of advantage (e.g.\nBaumgaertner et al., 2006; Murphy et al., 2009). While\nwe are confident in the realism of the NMT-estimates from\nthe use of radars at Eureka and Svalbard, which indicate the\ndominance of forcing at the SPW1 (Manson et al., 2009), at\nlower latitudes near 50\u25e6 there are likely to be other or mul-\ntiple NMT wave numbers present (Manson et al., 2004a, b,\n2006). For example forcing at wave number S=4 is signifi-\ncant there. Thus in this paper we have used the % ratio of MT\nto the semidiurnal tidal variance observed at two locations.\nSatellites, models or very extensive ground-based mea-\nsurements are required to resolve all dominant wave num-\nbers at tropical to polar latitudes (e.g. Manson et al., 2004a;\nForbes and Wu, 2006; Cierpik et al., 2003; Angelats i Coll\nand Forbes, 2002; Jacobi et al., 1999; Oberheide et al.,\n2007). Specifically in this study, the relative contribution\nof migrating tide to the observed (wave number unresolved)\nSDTs at polar latitudes (\u223c80\u25e6 N) and at high mid-latitudes\n(\u223c50\u25e6 N) are estimated based upon the observations from\nthe Svalbard-Eureka pair and the Collm-Saskatoon pair. At\nthe latitudes of Svalbard and Eureka and for the meridional\ncomponent, the s=2 (migrating) SDT is often dominant in\nlate summer time (July\u2013September), while the non-migrating\ntide occurs typically during late fall (starting at upper heights\nin October and then onto December), late spring (April to\nJune), and spasmodically during the winter (associated with\nstratospheric warmings). The favoured NMT wavenumber\nfor 2006\/2007 during such intervals was shown by Man-\nson et al. (2009) to be s=1, for zonal and meridional com-\nponents, after full discussion of the limitations of the use\nof pairs of radars for this purpose (also recall the discus-\nsion of wavenumber in Sect. 2 above). At the latitudes of\nCollm and Saskatoon, the MT dominates during nearly all\nmonths except for the October. The relative importance of\nMT\/NMT is not directly analysed for the latitude of 70\u25e6 N\nsince there are currently no suitable mesospheric wind obser-\nvations available in the Pacific-Canada longitudinal sector at\nthis latitude. However, the non-migrating contribution to the\nTroms\u00f8 SDT variability is expected to be less important in\nlate summer-early fall based upon the extrapolation from the\nanalyses at \u223c80\u25e6 N and \u223c50\u25e6 N. In addition, the studies of\nManson et al. (2006) and Riggin et al. (2003) indicated that\nthe migrating SDT is dominant during the mid-high latitudes\n(40\u201365\u25e6 N) maxima of August\u2013September; and Portnyagin\net al. (2004) also indicated that the migrating SDT dominates\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 4239\u20134256, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4239\/2009\/\nX.

Fig-\nure 11 shows the wavenumber spectra based on the CMAM-\nDAS (Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model with Data As-\nsimilation System; Polavarapu et al., 2005) for the merid-\nional SDT at 88 km and for three months (August, Septem-\nber 2006 and January 2007). In the NH the migrating SDT\n(s=+2, westward) is clearly dominant in late-summer\/early\nfall (August\u2013September) and mid-winter. The CMAM-DAS\nprovides agreement with our fitting of the MT to the data\nfrom two radars, and then the determination of the relative\nimportance of the MT\/NMT.\nDuring the two summer-fall seasons, the Troms\u00f8 SDT am-\nplitudes below 90 km show significant and positive correla-\ntions with the SPW1 amplitudes in high latitude southern\nstratosphere and lower mesosphere (Fig. 3b and d), albeit for\nsmall height ranges. Positive correlations are even more evi-\ndent for the tidal amplitudes observed at \u223c50\u25e6 N. In particu-\nlar, the Saskatoon SDT amplitudes are observed to be highly\nand positively correlated with the SPW1 amplitudes in high\nsouthern latitudes (Fig. 4). However, our explanation for the\ncorrelations differs from the study of Smith et al. (2007). As\nhypothesized by Smith et al. (2007), the NH summer-fall cor-\nrelation between the amplitudes of the Esrange (68\u25e6 N) SDT\nand SH SPW1 indicated a physical inter-hemispheric link;\nthe dominance of the non-migrating contribution to the ob-\nserved tidal variability could explain the correlation. How-\never, the authors did not provide convincing evidence for the\ndominance of the non-migrating SDT at the latitude of Es-\nrange. Here our analyses indicate the non-migrating SDT\ngenerally plays a much less important role than the migrat-\ning SDT at mid-high northern latitudes (\u223c50\u201370\u25e6 N) during\nlate summer\u2013early fall. Hence, the nonlinear interaction be-\ntween the migrating SDT and the SH SPW, via the gener-\nations of non-migrating SDT, cannot account for the corre-\nlations found between the observed tidal variability in the\nNH mesosphere and the SH SPW. Here our interpretation\nfor the high correlation is that there is usually a similar sea-\nsonal dependence between the amplitudes of the NH SDT\n(50\u223c70\u25e6 N) and SH SPW1, i.e., being small in early sum-\nmer and then large in late summer and fall. The correlations\nare usually dominated by the low-frequency variability (usu-\nally >25 days) of the SDT and SPW1 amplitudes. The late\nsummer and early autumn (August-September) enhancement\nof the SDT amplitude in the NH mesosphere is primarily a\nbehaviour of a migrating tide caused by other mechanisms\n(e.g. the refractive effects suggested by Riggin et al., 2003)\nrather than the SPW-tidal interaction, while the growth of\nSPW activity in the SH stratosphere during austral late win-\nter (August-October) is related to the breakdowns of the polar\nvortex and the final stratospheric warming in the SH. While\nthese two events (SH and NH) may be distantly and physi-\ncally related, at this stage of our understanding and until a\nmodel such as CMAM-DAS is used diagnostically, no such\nclaims of inter-hemispheric coupling will here be claimed.\nFurther, if the correlations for the Troms\u00f8 and Saskatoon\ntides are due to the non-migrating contribution, then the\nobserved Arctic tidal amplitudes at appropriate longitudes\nshould have even better correlations with the SH SPW am-\nplitudes since the relative contribution of the non-migrating\ntides are larger at Arctic latitudes. However, the SDT ampli-\ntudes observed at Svalbard (78\u25e6 N) and Eureka (80\u25e6 N) gen-\nerally do not provide persistent significant correlations with\nthe SPW1 amplitudes in the high latitude Southern Hemi-\nsphere for the two summer-fall seasons (Fig. 1; negative cor-\nrelations for the Svalbard 94 km tide are statistical artefacts).\nNote that due to the longitudinal variation of the phase of\nthe NMT the tidal amplitude modulation in the presence of\nnon-migrating tides is different for stations at different lon-\ngitudes. For example, Baumgaertner et al. (2006) showed\nin their Fig. 10 that at 78\u25e6 S and 90 km altitude there is a\npreferred longitude (longitudinal maximum) for constructive\ninterference between an s=2 migrating SDT and an s=1 non-\nmigrating SDT. Thus at this longitude (call it L) an s=1 tide\nwould cause an enhancement in the total unresolved SDT\namplitude (s=1+s=2), and an observed positive correlation\nwith the SPW1 amplitude. Conversely at L+180 degrees\nlongitude an s=1 tide will cause a decrease in the total un-\nresolved SDT, and an observed negative correlation with the\nSPW1. At longitudes of L\u00b190 degrees there would be lit-\ntle observed effect. However, the situation is different for the\nNH. Our analysis clearly indicated that at\u223c80\u25e6 N the migrat-\ning SDT is dominant and the non-migrating is weak for NH\nlate-summer\/early fall. Therefore, there should be no signif-\nicant longitudinal variability for the observed SDT of Arctic\nlatitudes assuming the s=2 SDT amplitude is unchanged. In-\ndeed the height versus time contours of SDT amplitude ra-\ntios for Svalbard and Eureka (Fig. 8 of Manson et al., 2009)\nclearly show ratios near unity in late summer\/early fall. Thus,\nthe Arctic SDTs observed at other longitudes are expected to\nexhibit similar statistical results (i.e. no real correlations with\nthe SH SPW). This further confirms the small effect of the\nSH SPW on the NH tidal variability in the NH summer-fall\nmonths. The SH-winter SPW is usually much weaker com-\npared with their northern counterpart (this paper; Manson et\nal., 2009; van Loon and Jenne, 1972; Aso, 2007). This could\nbe an important reason why the Antarctic-winter SPW\u2019s driv-\ning of the non-migrating SDT in the Arctic-summer is less\nsignificant, and thus less likely to be observed.\nNote that although we think the local summer tidal vari-\nability in the NH is not physically associated with the growth\nof SPW activity in the opposite hemisphere, the global forc-\ning of the non-migrating tide by the SPW is possible in\nOctober. Our analyses show that the dominance of non-\nmigrating tides usually first appears during this equinoctial\ntime (October and onto November) while the simultaneous\nSPW amplitudes in both hemispheres are often comparable.\nChshyolkova et al. (2006) have shown that inter-hemispheric\npropagation of planetary waves probably occurs during the\nequinox months, which enhances the possibility of NMT\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4239\/2009\/ Ann.

However, this SPW-NMT link in October has a\nweak contribution to the 120-day correlation between the ob-\nserved NH SDT and SH SPW1.\nDuring NH winter-centred months (early November to\nearly March), the mesospheric SDT amplitudes observed at\nnorthern middle\/high latitudes (\u223c50\u201380\u25e6 N) are often ob-\nserved to be significantly and positively correlated with the\nSPW1 amplitudes in the local hemisphere (Figs. 7 and 8).\nThese correlations are also usually dominated by the low-\nfrequency variability (usually >15 days) for the SDT and\nSPW1 amplitudes. Because both the SPW and migrating\nSDT are often large in the NH during NH winter, the SPW-\nMT non-linear interaction probably occurs in the NH, pro-\nviding the non-migrating s=1 SDT which could then propa-\ngate into the SH and lead to the local summer enhancement\nof the s=1 NMT in the SH (e.g. January 2007 in Fig. 11,\n58\u201387\u25e6 S). Our Fig. 2 shows that departure from MT domi-\nnance occurs spasmodically from mid-December through to\nApril. Corresponding to this, the height versus time contours\nof SDT amplitude ratios for Svalbard and Eureka (Fig. 8\nof Manson et al., 2009) clearly show large ratios for those\nmonths. That is consistent with the studies of Yamashita et\nal. (2002) and Baumgaertner et al. (2006), and suggested by\nManson et al. (2009).\nThe aforementioned discussions reveal little evidence that\nthe summer-fall variability of the Arctic SDT is associated\nwith the Antarctic SPW of austral winter. In contrast, as\nnoted above, during NH winter the Arctic SPW driving\nthe Antarctic non-migrating SDT is possible (also Murphy\net al., 2009). Figure 12 provides good agreement for the\namplitude variability between the NH stratospheric SPW1\nand the meridional SDT (86\u201390 km) observed at Rothera\n(68\u25e6 S, 68\u25e6 W) during December-February of 2006\/2007.\nThe Rothera-correlations are consistent with this location\nbeing within a longitudinal maximum of the observed tide.\nThe Arctic SPW amplitudes are generally much larger than\nthose in the Antarctica during the winter of each hemisphere.\nSo the Arctic SPW, via interacting with migrating tides, is\nmore likely to account for the local summer enhancement of\nAntarctic non-migrating SDT.\nThis study does not explain what drives the high variabil-\nity of the observed SDT, especially for the late-summer\/early\nfall enhancement. This is a very complex subject. Riggin et\nal. (2003) listed various mechanisms and focused on the re-\nfractive effects. A detailed analysis for all possible sources\nof the tidal variability would require more efforts and is be-\nyond the scope of this paper. In addition, note that some\ndifferences are shown in the correlation plots between the\ntwo years, which might be due to the effect of the quasi-\nbiennial oscillation (QBO) that has opposite phases in the\ntwo years (e.g. Espy et al.,1997; Jacobi et al., 1998; Hib-\nbins et al., 2007). The relation between interannual varia-\ntions in the SPW and tides has been presented in the most\nrecent study (Xu et al., 2009).\n7 Conclusions\nThe SDTs observed at NH high\/Arctic latitudes failed to\nexhibit any real correlation with the Antarctic SPW1 in\nNH summer-fall, in contrast with the claims of Smith et\nal. (2007). The correlations for the Troms\u00f8 and Saskatoon\ntides are considered at this time to be due to the trends of\nthe tides and SH SPW1 amplitudes during the respective\nequinoctial transitions. Although such individual trends will\nencompass physical processes that have a global dimension,\nwithout diagnostic assessment of an excellent GCM sim-\nple causality involving SPW and SDT cannot be provided\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 4239\u20134256, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/4239\/2009\/\nX. Xu et al.: Variability of the semidiurnal tide and quasi-stationary planetary waves 4255\nat this point. During austral winter the PWs at Antarctic lati-\ntudes are usually weaker than their Arctic-winter counterpart,\nwhich possibly prevents the occurrence of strong wave-tide\ninteractions and the generation of the non-migrating tides.\nThe SH interaction driving the NH non-migrating tides might\noccur merely, for example, for the austral winter of 2002 that\nwas historically unique due to the presence of a major SSW\nand unusually high PW activity. Conversely, during NH win-\nters the PWs are often strong, which probably supports the\nextensive occurrence of strong SPW-migrating tide interac-\ntion. The latter could then, given good propagation condi-\ntions, lead to the summer enhancement of the NMT in the\nSH.\nThe \u201cpercentage power in the MT\u201d from the pair of radars\nwas used as an additional factor in the physical assessment\nof the correlation: a value close to 100% indicates the dom-\ninance of the MT, and smaller values indicate the increasing\npresence and at times dominance of NMT. This strategy was\nshown to be effective, as the MT was shown simply to be\ndominant in the Arctic from mid-summer to early fall. A re-\nviewer had expressed concerns that the otherwise desirable\n\u201czonal wavenumber resolved NMT\u201d, which can be numer-\nically obtained from radar pairs, may be problematic espe-\ncially at non-Arctic latitudes. We discussed this matter in\nthis paper, agreed to differ to some degree, but did not pro-\nvide figures with NMT of particular wavenumber.\nAcknowledgements.
