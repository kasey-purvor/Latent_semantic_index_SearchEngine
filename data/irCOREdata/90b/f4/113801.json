INTRODUCTION\nHigh-K isomers are well known in the A \u223c 180 region of the nuclear chart [1, 2] but the\nidentification of examples in the neutron-rich part of this mass region has proved challenging,\ndue to the lack of production reactions with suitable selectivity. Considerable progress has\nnevertheless been made with deep-inelastic [3], fragmentation [4], and incomplete-fusion [5]\nreactions. With the possibility of low recoil energy, incomplete fusion can have a particular\nadvantage for the measurement of conversion electrons, thus providing essential information\nfor structural assignments. This is the approach taken in the present work.\nThe motivation is to extend in N and Z the accessible range of multi-quasiparticle isomers\nin theA \u223c 180 region, with the intent of pinning down the relative importance of the different\nK-mixing mechanisms that have been put forward to explain K-isomer decay rates [2, 6].\nWe report results from a study of odd-Z 171Tm. A previous study [7] of this nuclide with the\nsame reaction had revealed rotational bands up to I = 19\/2 built on the T1\/2 = 1.9 y, 1\/2\n+\nground state and a 2.6 \u00b5s, 7\/2\u2212 state at 425 keV, each of one-quasiparticle character. A 1.3\nns, 7\/2+ one-quasiparticle state at 636 keV is also well known [8]. The present work reports\ndelayed feeding through the 7\/2+ state, and establishes a three-quasiparticle, 19\/2+ isomer\nwith a half-life of 1.7 \u00b5s. We note that results from a parallel study of 172Tm, measured\nwith the same beam\/target combination, have recently been published [9].\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nBeams of 42 MeV 7Li, from the ANU 14UD tandem accelerator, were incident on self-\nsupporting 170Er target foils. The main yield was from the 170Er(7Li,4n)173Lu reaction, as\nreported by Venkova et al. [10], but here the focus is on the 170Er(7Li,\u03b12n)171Tm incomplete-\nfusion reaction.\nThe experiment was conducted in two parts. First, with a 4.1 mg\/cm2 target, \u03b3 rays were\nrecorded with the CAESAR array, consisting of six Compton-suppressed coaxial Ge detectors\nand two unsuppressed planar Ge detectors. The latter gave improved performance at low\n\u03b3-ray energies. The target was sufficiently thick to stop almost all the recoiling reaction\nproducts. A variety of beam-pulsing conditions, ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds,\nwere employed, with \u03b3-ray singles and coincidences timed relative to the beam bursts (see\n2\nalso the parallel study of 172Tm [9]).\nFollowing the observation of previously unreported \u03b3-ray transitions with half-lives in the\nmicrosecond region, a conversion-electron measurement was performed with the ANU Super-\ne spectrometer [11], operated in lens mode. Gamma rays were measured simultaneously,\nusing a single Compton-suppressed Ge detector. Both electron and \u03b3-ray events were timed\nrelative to the 1 \u00b5s beam bursts, which were separated by 9 \u00b5s. For this measurement, a 1.5\nmg\/cm2 target was employed, at 30\u25e6 to the beam direction, which is thick enough to stop\nmost of the reaction products.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe focus of the present measurements was on the detection of \u03b3-ray and conversion-\nelectron transitions between beam bursts, i.e. those associated with the decay of isomeric\nstates. Table I lists these \u201cdelayed\u201d transitions assigned to 171Tm, and figure 1 shows the\ncorresponding level structure, deduced on the basis of \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence relationships. A \u03b3-ray\ncoincidence spectrum is shown in figure 2, illustrating transitions associated with isomeric\ndecay from a level at 1674 keV.\nThe parts of the level scheme involving the Kpi = 1\/2+[411] and 7\/2\u2212[523] bands, and\nthe 7\/2+[404] bandhead, were already known from previous studies [7, 8] and the present\nwork is in agreement. However, two excited members of the 7\/2+ band, above the 636 keV\nlevel, had been tentatively identified by Drissi et al. [7], with \u03b3-ray transitions at 108, 129\nand 237 keV. No evidence is found for these transitions in the present data. The excited\nmembers of the 7\/2+ band shown in figure 1, and the 19\/2+ isomer at 1674 keV, are newly\nidentified.\nIt is evident from figure 1 that there are many \u03b3-ray branches, so that there are no\nambiguities in the ordering of transitions within the level scheme. However, there is the\npotential for confusion with unresolved transitions in 173Lu [10, 12], which is much more\nstrongly produced in the present study. In particular, the 7\/2+ bands in each of these\nnuclides have essentially the same transition energies, at least over the spin range shown in\nfigure 1. Nevertheless, there are two features that remove the ambiguity. First, in 173Lu the\n7\/2+ bandhead forms the ground state, whereas in 171Tm the 7\/2+ bandhead is an excited\nstate. This was already known [8] to decay primarily by a 211 keV transition, which, in\n3\nthe present work, gives rise to different \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence relationships. Second, and crucially,\nthere are significant differences between the K-electron binding energies (59.4 keV for Tm,\nand 63.3 keV for Lu). The comparison between the electron and \u03b3-ray energies (see figure\n3) demonstrates electron binding energies that are consistent only with Tm. It is therefore\ndeduced that only states in 171Tm are fed significantly by an isomer in the \u00b5s range. The\nhalf-life of the isomer is measured to be 1.7(2) \u00b5s, as illustrated in figure 4.\nTwo levels are tentatively placed above the Kpi = 19\/2+ isomer, on the basis of \u201cprompt-\ndelayed\u201d \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidence relationships, whereby gates are set on out-of-beam transitions and\na time-difference condition selects in-beam transitions that feed the corresponding isomer.\nFirm placements are not possible for these transitions because of the low cross section\nfor the incomplete-fusion reactions compared to the total cross section, leading to many\nunresolved in-beam transitions. The placement of the 19\/2+ member of the 7\/2+[404] band\nis in a similar category, based on \u201cprompt\u201d \u03b3-\u03b3-coincidences. The situation is, however,\nconsiderably simpler for isomeric decays, leading to firm placements below the isomer. It\nis assumed that, where there is a well defined sequence of levels for which the transition\nenergies closely follow I(I + 1) proportionality, i.e. for the level sequences above the 7\/2\u2212\nand 7\/2+ isomers, then the characteristic rotational-band spin assignments are justified.\nFor the analysis of the electron conversion coefficients, the known [8] E1 character of the\n308 keV transition (seen in figures 1 and 3) from the 2.6 \u00b5s, 7\/2\u2212 isomer in 171Tm provides a\nconvenient internal calibration, with a theoretical conversion coefficient of \u03b1K = 0.0151 [13].\nBased on this, together with off-line calibrations, other conversion coefficients are obtained,\nas listed in table II.\nThe measured conversion coefficient of the 352 keV transition (table II) establishes E2\ncharacter, which is consistent with its placement as a cross-over transition in a strongly\ncoupled rotational band. More significantly, the 428 keV transition is also established to have\nE2 multipolarity, which (in combination with the other observed decay branches) determines\nIpi = 19\/2+ for the spin and parity of the 1.7 \u00b5s isomer. In accordance with usual practice,\nthe K value is taken to be equal to the bandhead spin, i.e. K = 19\/2.\n4\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe one-quasiparticle states (bandheads) shown in figure 1 have been assigned [7, 8]\nthe proton (\u03c0) 1\/2+[411], 7\/2\u2212[523] and 7\/2+[404] Nilsson configurations. The new \u03b3-ray\nintensity data for the 7\/2+ band (table I) provide in-band branching ratios that can be\nused to give g-factor estimates, based on rotational-model formulae (given in ref. [9]), and\nhence the 7\/2+[404] assignment can be tested. Assuming an intrinsic quadrupole moment of\nQo = 7.6 eb, taken from a measurement for the same configuration in the isotone\n173Lu [14],\nthe branching ratios yield |gK\u2212gR| = 0.33(3) (weighted average). This can be compared with\nthe theoretical asymptotic-limit value, using the Nilsson quantum numbers with gs = 0.6g\nfree\ns\nand gR = 0.35, which gives gK \u2212 gR = 0.31, in agreement with the experimental value.\nMulti-quasiparticle Nilsson-model calculations, of the type described by Jain et\nal. [15], have also been performed. These indicate a three-quasiparticle Kpi = 19\/2+\n{\u03c07\/2\u2212[523], \u03bd7\/2+[633], \u03bd5\/2\u2212[512]} configuration for the 1.7 \u00b5s isomer. Indeed, using stan-\ndard parameters [15] with pairing strengths of G\u03bd = 20.25\/A MeV and Gpi = 21.25\/A MeV,\ndeformations of \u01eb2 = 0.263, \u01eb4 = 0.035 [16], and no specific allowance for configuration-\ndependent residual interactions, the Kpi = 19\/2+ isomer is calculated to have an excitation\nenergy of 1694 keV. This is in good agreement with the experimental energy of 1674 keV.\nHowever, it should be noted that this kind of calculation [15] has uncertainties \u223c100 keV,\nso that the small (20 keV) difference between the experimental and calculated energies is\nfortuitous.\nThe remainder of the discussion focuses on the implications of the isomer half-life in\nterms of K-mixing mechanisms. For decay \u03b3 rays that are highly K forbidden, it is common\npractice to consider the hindrance per degree of K forbiddenness, also called the reduced\nhindrance, f\u03bd = (T\n\u03b3\n1\/2\/T\nW\n1\/2)\n1\/\u03bd , where T \u03b3\n1\/2 is the experimentally deduced partial \u03b3-ray half-\nlife for the transition, TW1\/2 is the corresponding Weisskopf single-particle estimate, and \u03bd is\nthe degree of forbiddenness (with \u03bd = \u2206K \u2212 \u03bb, for multipolarity \u03bb). In the present case,\nthree K-forbidden transitions are observed from the Kpi = 19\/2+ isomer. Their properties\nare given in table III. For the interpretation given below, the reduced hindrance of the 438\nkeV, E2 (\u03bd = 4) transition, f\u03bd = 7.6, is the most important.\nIt is reasonable to say that reduced hindrance values are typically in the range 20 <\nf\u03bd < 300 [18]. In addition, for E2 transitions from two- and three-quasiparticle isomers,\n5\nreduced hindrance values have been shown [6] to be strongly correlated with the product\nof the valence nucleon numbers, NpNn. This is perhaps not surprising because, in essence,\nthe more deformed nuclides, with higher NpNn values, would have less Coriolis K mixing,\nthough other factors also need to be taken into account [6]. In the present case, 171Tm has\nNpNn = 260, which is close to the\n174Yb value of NpNn = 264. However, the E2 (\u03bd = 4)\ndecay component from the Kpi = 6+ isomer of 174Yb is highly hindered, with f\u03bd = 341 [19].\nTherefore, the 171Tm value of f\u03bd = 7.6 is seen, by comparison, to be remarkably small, and\nmore detailed consideration is appropriate.\nOne factor is that the three-quasiparticle configuration includes the 7\/2+[633], i13\/2 neu-\ntron, which, due to its high-j value, is susceptible to Coriolis-induced rotation alignment and\nassociated K mixing. However, comparison with other isomers suggests that this does not\nhave a dramatic effect on the decay rate. For example, the configuration of the 19\/2+ isomer\nin 175Hf [17] includes the 7\/2+[633] neutron, and the E2 reduced hindrance still follows the\nNpNn correlation [6].\nInspection of the 171Tm level scheme reveals that the Kpi = 19\/2+ isomer is very close in\nenergy to the Ipi = 19\/2+ member of the Kpi = 7\/2+ rotational band. The two 19\/2+ states\nare only \u2206E = 11 keV apart. (The fact that the Kpi = 7\/2+ band extension beyond spin\n17\/2 is tentative leads to only a small energy uncertainty, estimated to be \u00b12 keV, since\nthe energy spacing of the levels is seen to be regular, and is almost identical to that of the\ncorresponding 7\/2+ band in 173Lu [12]. In the latter case, the E2 transition from the 19\/2+\nband member has an energy of 440 keV, compared to the tentative 439 keV in 171Tm.) It is\ntherefore appropriate to evaluate the effect of mixing between the two 19\/2+ levels, and to\nsee whether this can account for the unexpectedly fast E2 decay of the isomer.\nThe suggestion is that a small K = 7\/2 admixture in the predominantly K = 19\/2\nbandhead can explain the experimental 428 keV, E2 transition rate. It is assumed that\nthere is a collective K = 7\/2 component with reduced transition probability, B(E2) =\n5\n16pi\ne2Q2o| < I1K20|I2K > |\n2. Since the final state is taken to be pure K = 7\/2, it is only the\nK = 7\/2 component in the isomeric state that needs to be evaluated. Assuming, as before,\nthat Qo = 7.6 eb, then the required admixture (amplitude squared) is \u03b2\n2 = 1.2\u00d710\u22126. In the\ntwo-level-mixing interpretation, the mixing matrix element for small \u03b2 is |V | = \u2206E\u00d7\u03b2 [20],\nand here \u2206E = 11(2) keV. Thus |V | = 12(2) eV is obtained. This fits well with the analysis\nof chance near-degeneracies given by Dracoulis et al. [20]. Therefore, the fast decay from\n6\nthe Kpi = 19\/2+ isomer in 171Tm can be explained as being due to a chance near-degeneracy\nwith a lower-K state of the same spin and parity.\nIf this analysis of the E2 transition rate from the isomer is correct, then the M1 strength\nfrom the isomer should follow the rotational-model formulae, as used earlier for the branching\nratios within the 7\/2+ band. Based on this approach, the branching ratio for the isomeric\n428 and 219 keV transitions, with K = 7\/2 imposed, yields |gK \u2212 gR| = 0.35(3), which\nagrees with the value of |gK \u2212 gR| = 0.33(3) obtained for the K\npi = 7\/2+ band itself. This\nagreement supports the two-level-mixing interpretation.\nAlthough a simple explanation has thus been found for the E2 decay rate from the\nthree-quasiparticle isomer, the present work highlights the difficulty in predicting K-isomer\nhalf-lives. This is because near-degeneracies are inevitably difficult to predict accurately,\nand the half-life of an isomer is very sensitive to any small admixture that provides an\nallowed component for a transition that is otherwise forbidden.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA \u03b3-ray and conversion-electron study of 171Tm, using pulsed-beam techniques, has re-\nvealed an isomer at 1674 keV, with a half-life of 1.7(2) \u00b5s, assigned as a Kpi = 19\/2+,\nthree-quasiparticle state. The E2 decay rate from the isomer is much faster than expected\nfrom NpNn systematics, and is interpreted as being due to a chance near-degeneracy.\nThis work has been supported by the UK EPSRC, STFC, and AWE plc.\n7\n[1] P.M.
