Although significant research has\nbeen undertaken in understanding the potential of AE in monitoring gearboxes this\nhas been solely applied to spur gears. This report presents an experimental\ninvestigation that assesses the effectiveness of AE in identifying seeded defects on\nhelical gears; the first known attempt. In addition, a comparison between vibration\nand AE in identifying the presence of defects is presented. It was concluded that AE\noffered more sensitivity than vibration analysis for the defect identification on helical\ngears.\n1 Introduction\nAcoustic Emission (AE) is defined as the range of phenomena that results in the\ngeneration of structure-borne and fluid-borne (liquid, gas) propagating waves due to\nthe rapid release of energy from localised sources within and\/or on the surface of a\nmaterial [1]. The application of the acoustic emission technology in research and\nindustry is well-documented [2]. In relation to gearboxes a few investigators have\nassessed the application of AE technology for diagnostic and prognostic purposes [3-\n6]. Others [7-10] applied AE in detecting bending fatigue on spur gears and noted that\nAE is more sensitive to crack propagation than vibration and stiffness measurements.\nAgain, AE was found to be more sensitive to the scale of surface damage than\nvibration analysis.\nToutountzakis et al [11] employed a back-to-back test rig to investigate the\neffectiveness of AE in identifying seeded defects on spur gears. It was concluded that\ndefect detection with AE is fraught with difficulties and recommended further\nexperiments to achieve better understanding on the influence of operational variables\non the generation of AE. Toutountzakis,T. et. al [12], Raja Hamzah, R.I. et. al [13],\nand Tan,Chee Keong et. al [14, 15] investigated the influence of operational factors\nsuch as speed, torque and specific film thickness on the generation of Acoustic\nEmission on spur gears. Asperity contact was noted to be a significant source of AE\nunder Elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime, which is synonymous with gears [14].\nTo date, there has been no attempt to understanding the mechanisms for generating\nAE activity in helical gears, nor has an attempt to assess the ability of AE to identify\ndefects in such gears; considering helical gears are a major component of gearbox\napplications worldwide this is rather surprising. It is also known that the meshing\nmechanisms for a helical gear is progressive due to the gradual increase and decrease\nin contact length over a particular tooth whilst the spur gear mesh has a constant\ncontact length throughout the gear mesh. This report presents an experimental\ninvestigation that assesses the effectiveness of AE monitoring techniques for\nidentification of seeded defects on helical gears. In addition, the effect of gradual\ndefect growth is explored.\n2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n2.1 Test-rig\nThe gearbox test rig employed was of back-to-back arrangement (see fig 1), powered\nby 1.1KW motor with helical (214M15) steel test gears, see table 1. The gearbox was\nlubricated with Mobile gear 636 oil, see table 2, and operated at a speed of 690rpm.\nFigure 1 Gearbox test rig\nTable 1 Specification of test gears\nPinion Wheel\nNumber of teeth 51 70\nModule 3 mm 3 mm\nPressure angle 20\u00ba 20\u00ba\nHelix angle 17.5\u00ba 17.5\u00ba\nContact ratio 1.7 1.7\nFace width 25.1 mm 25.1 mm\nDirection Right Hand Left Hand\nHardness 137 Hv30 137 Hv30\nSurface roughness 1.327 \u00b5m 1.327 \u00b5m\nPitch circle diameter 160.65 mm 220.50 mm\nSize of Addendum 3 mm 3 mm\nSize of Dedendum 3.75 mm 3.75 mm\nSlave gears\nTest gears\nLoading plates\nWheels\nPinion\nTable 2 Specification of the oil\nLubricant properties Mobile Gear 636\nKinematics viscosity@40\u00ba 664 (cSt)\nKinematics viscosity@100\u00ba 62.8(cSt)\nViscosity index ASTM D2270 165\nDensity @ 15\u00ba ASTM D4052 0.87\n2.2 Instrumentation\nA wide-band AE sensor (type WD, from Physical Acoustic Limited) was employed to\nmeasure AE throughout the test. The AE sensor was fixed on the pinion using super\nglue (see figure 2). The AE sensor was of differential type with a relative flat response\nof between 100 kHz to 1 MHz.\nThe cable from the AE sensor was fed through a narrow longitudinal duct inside the\ninput shaft and connected to the slip ring. The slip ring (PH-12, IDM Electronic Ltd)\nplaced at the end of test gearbox. AE was recorded with MISTRAS AE DSP-32\/16\ndata acquisition card at a sampling rate of 10 MHz. An accelerometer (ISOBASE 236\nEndevco) with operating range of between 10 and 8000Hz was mounted on the\nbearing pedestal inside the test gearbox (see figure 2). A charge amplifier (Endevco\n2721B) was employed with a PersonalDaq3000 external acquisition board. All\nvibration data was recorded at a sampling rate of 10 KHz. In order to observe\ntemperature during the experiment a J-type thermocouple, rated from -60 to +850\u00baC,\nwas also placed inside the oil bath.\nFigure 2 AE sensor placement Accelerometer position on bearing\nAs this experiment centred on assessing the applicability of AE for identifying seeded\ndefects on helical gears, it was paramount that any data recorded was taken from a\ndefined circumferential point every revolution. For this reason, an optical triggering\nmechanism was employed. The triggering system consisted of metal disk with 2mm\ndiameter hole and an optical sensor. Each time the hole passed trough the optical\nsensor the AE and vibration acquisition systems were triggered (see figure 3).\nFigure 3 Data acquisition triggering mechanism\nAE Sensor\nAccelerometer\n3 Test procedure\nPrior to the testing the gearbox was run for 3-hours at 380Nm so as to allow the\ngearbox to dynamically settle and reach a stabilized temperature; in this instance\n60\u00baC. It was essentail to capture AE and vibration data that included the defective\ntooth and as such and acquisition time frame, or window, of 16-teeth was set whereby\nthe trigger mechanism ensured an acquisition duration of 0.0256-seconds,\ncorresponding to 16 teeth at 690 rpm. To begin the tests a defect free recording of AE\nand vibration was undertaken. The gearbox was then stopped and the torque set to\n250Nm and run for 5-minutes to accommodate the new dynamic condition. Again,\ndefect free AE and vibration data were captured for the same acquisition window. The\nsame procedure was repeated at 180Nm. The defect free condition will be referred to\ndefect-0, see table 3.\nIn order to carry out the seeded defect test, the test rig was stopped and the first\ndefect (defect-1, see table 3) introduced on the seventh tooth using a drill (see figure\n4). The gearbox was then started and vibration and AE data for the time frame\nencompassing the damaged tooth was acquired instantly. The significance of the\ninstantaneous recording was to allow the authors to explore the influence of\nsurface\/material deformation on the levels of AE and vibration as some investigators\nhad suggested [11, 16]. The gearbox was allowed to operate until the temperature\nreached 60\u00baC after which AE and vibration signals were again recorded for the\nspecific defect condition. The same procedure was repeated at 250Nm and 180Nm\nrespectively. The test sequence continued for six more defects conditions as detailed\nin table 3. Eventually, four sets of data for each defect were produced. The first was\nassociated with data at 380 Nm torque, captured immediately after the defects were\ngenerated, and referred as \u2018D\u2019 throughout this report. Other sets of data corresponded\nto the data at 380Nm, 250Nm and 180Nm for constant temperature (60 \u00ba C) and\nlabelled as \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 respectively.\nTwenty sets of AE data were recorded for every defect and load condition. Each AE\ndata file corresponded to a waveform representing 16 teeth with time length of 0.0256\nseconds (see figure 5). Similarly, vibration data was captured at 10kHz sampling rate\nover a time window of 0.0256sec. The vibration data was averaged\nTable 3 Details of seeded defects\nDefect type Size(mm\u00b2) Depth(mm) Removed Volume(mm\u00b3) Defect tooth\nDefect-0 0 0 0 7\nDefect-1 18.88 0.1 1.888 7\nDefect-2 28.71 0.2 5.742 7\nDefect-3 41.22 0.5 20.61 7\nDefect-4 17.5 1 17.5 7\nDefect-5 15 0.8 12 7\nDefect-6 158.75 0.2 31.75 11\nDefect-7 163.5 0.2 32.7 15\nFigure 4 Seeded defect on the tooth\n4 Result and discussion\n4.1 Results based on Acoustic Emission monitoring\nA typical waveform associated with the defect free condition at 380Nm is presented\nin figure 5. Continuous type AE waveform is dominant although there also existed\ntransient AE bursts whose amplitude exceeds the underlying continuous wave; the\nfrequency of the periodicity of the AE bursts represented the number of meshing teeth\nwithin the acquisition window. This is similar to observations of AE waveforms in\nspur gear mesh in which both continuous and transient type forms of AE activity were\napparent [14]. Tan et al [14] concluded that rolling contact on the pitch line of the\nspur gear mesh was responsible for generating of high amplitude AE transient burst,\nwhilst sliding contact was attributed to the generation a large portion of the\ncontinuous waveform.\nIn relation to helical gears, contact between a specific gear pair begins as a minute\ncontact point which increases in contact length on the engaging pair whilst decreasing\nin contact length on the disengaging pair of gears. As such, the contact length varies\nalong the pitch line of the helical gears whereas in spur gears the contact length\nremains constant. In addition, the continued variation in the contact length during\nmeshing of helical gears [17], which directly influences the load conditions\nexperienced by the gear, will lead to instantaneous changes in oil film thickness.\nTherefore, AE waveforms associated with the helical gear mesh were expected to be\nof the continuous type with amplitude variations attributed to the gear mesh, see\nfigure 5.\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nTime(sec)\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n(V\nol\nts\n)\nFigure 5 Mixed modes AE waveform associated with a defect free condition\nFigure 6 shows typical AE waveforms associated with each defect condition which\nshowed relatively large transient AE bursts over continuous operational AE levels.\nThe transient AE bursts where noted to occur at the exact tooth where the defect was\nseeded, see figure 6.

In general an increase in AE r.m.s levels for\nincreasing defect size for all test load conditions was noted, see figure 7. For load\nconditions B (250Nm) and C (180Nm) an increase in AE r.m.s levels with increasing\ndefect width and number of defective teeth was evident though for test condition A\n(380Nm) and D (380Nm) a similar trend was observed between \u2018defect-free\u2019 and\ndefect-3 conditions after which r.m.s values decreased slightly from defect-3 to\ndefect-5; AE r.m.s levels increased again from defect-5 to defect-7. The exact reason\nfor this observation is addressed later in the paper. It was noted that the increased load\ncondition did not necessarily always imply increased AE levels. This was noted for\nload condition \u2018A\u2019 (380Nm) after defect-4. The exact reason for this decrease is still\nunclear.\n0\n1\n2\n3 4 5\n6\n7\n0\n1\n2 3\n4 5\n6 7\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4 6\n7\n1\n2\n3 4\n5\n6 7\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nDefect No\nA\nE\nr.\nm\n.\ns\n(V\no\nlt)\n380N.M (A)\n250N.M (B)\n180N.M (C)\nDefect Initiation (D)\nFigure 7 AE r.m.s values for each defect condition\nOf interest is that the AE r.m.s levels of the initial defect condition (D) were relatively\nhigher than all other test conditions but for one test condition (Defect-6, 250Nm).\nThis was not surprising giving that asperity contact has been shown to be a major\nsource of AE generation during gear mesh [14, 18, 19]. Also, as noted by others [11,\n16, 21] the influence of material protrusions around the edge of a seeded defect cavity\nwhich are relatively higher than the rest of the gear surface roughness, caused as a\ndirect result of generating seeded faults, will generate AE activity. Giving that after\nseveral thousand of revolutions (1,300,000) the protrusions will be progressively\nflattened resulting in a relative reduction in AE levels as noted in figure 7; this\nconfirms the postulations of Tan et al [16] and Al-Dossary et. al [21]. Figure 8\nschematically presents the process of AE generation due to the presence of\nprotrusions.\nFigure 8 Schmatic of the effect of protrusions on AE activity\nTo address the reason for the decrease in AE levels with increasing defect size, as\nnoted for test conditions A and D (defect-3 and defect-5), the approximate volume of\neach defect was calculated following casting of the defect onto \u2018plaster\u2019 so as to\nobtain a three-dimensional profile. Plotting the volume removed against AE r.m.s\nyielded an interesting observation, see figure 9. A direct relationship between the\ndefect volume and AE was noted for test conditions \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019; in some cases where\nthe defect width was relatively wide but the volume removed relatively less (e.g.,\ndefect-5 was wider than defect-3 but the volume removed in defect-3 was more than\ndefect-5), the AE r.m.s levels were higher for the case of the larger volume removed.\nFor cases B and C the observation was not similar, particularly at defect-3. This has\nsome implications particularly in understanding other influencing sources of AE\nduring meshing. This suggested the influence of the mechanism of interaction of the\nfluid within the defect cavity would appear to offer a source of AE activity. This\nparticular observation was investiagetd further. To this end further tests were\nWheel\nPinion\nProtrusions that result in high amplitude\nAE traisneint events during contact with the\nwheel\nFlattend protrusions\ngenerating relatively less\nAE activityAE\na)\nb)\nundertaken. A gear tooth was selected and holes of varying depth (volume) and a\nfixed diameter (2.5mm) were drilled into the tooth, see table 4 and figure 10.\n6\n7\n34\n5\n1\n0\n2 7\n63\n452\n1\n0\n6 7\n3\n4\n5\n2\n1\n0\n7\n6\n3\n4\n5\n2\n1\n0\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nVolume of removed material\nA\nE\nr.\nm\n.\ns\n(V\no\nlt)\nDefect Initiation (D)\n380 N.M(A)\n250 N.M(B)\n180N.M(C)\nFigure 9 AE r.m.s against volume of removed material for all condition\nTable 4 Specification of increasing defects volume on a fixed tooth at 380Nm\nDefect No Depth\n0 Defect free\n1 1mm\n2 3mm\n3 5mm\n4 7mm\n5 (Second hole) 7mm\n6 (Third hole) 7mm\nFigure 10 Drilled holes on the tooth surface\nAfter each depth was seeded the rig was operated for 45minutes (3,000,000\nrevolutions) before any AE data was recored. This was to ensure the temparture\nremianed contanst throughout the tests. Results, presented in figure 11, showed that\nan increase in AE r.m.s was a direct consequence of increased cavity volume,\nstrongly supporting the notion that the entrapped lubricant within a cavity (pit, spall,\netc) will also contirbute to the level of AE measured. The sampling rate applied for\nthese poarticular tests was 4MHz and a total of 65,536 data points were recorded per\nfile, of which over 25-data files were acquired for each volume condition. This is the\nfirst known attempt at investigating this phenomonon and will, in the fullness of time,\nlead to future investigations. A typical waveform associated with these volumetric\ntests is presented in figure 12 and it shows that the holes did not cause any materal\nproducions nor did they result in an AE waveform typical of the presence of a defect\nas seen in figure 6.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 60.25\n0.3\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.5\n0.55\n0.6\nDefect No\nr.\nm\n.\ns(V\no\nlt)\nFigure 9 AE r.m.s level against depth of the drilled hole\n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 0.012 0.014 0.016 0.018\n-2.5\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nTime(sec)\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n(V\no\nlt)\n6th Defect\nFigure 12 Typical waveform for volumetric defect\n4.2 Results based on vibration signatures\nTwenty sets of data for each defect at different conditions based on 10 KHz sampling\nrate were captured and synchronously averaged.

The vibration\nr.m.s level at D-condition was relatively higher than for all other conditions for the\nreasons discussed earlier. In addition, the plastic deformation of protrusions around\nthe defect will lead to alteration in stiffness and consequently growth in vibration\n[20]. In comparison to AE r.m.s levels, the vibration r.m.s levels remained relatively\nconstant irrespective of defect condition reiterating the widely held view that AE is\nrelatively more sensitive than vibration [2], see figure 13.\nFigure 14 illustrates the vibration energy values for each defect condition calculated\nby integrating the frequency spectrum of the signal condition over the frequency\nrange encompassing meshing frequency and its side bands and harmonics of the side\nbands (350 to 850 Hz).

Seeded defects in helical gears are evident in the AE waveform. This not the\ncase for spur gears.\n2. There is a direct relation between volume of removed material and AE r.m.s;\nthis is the first observation of its kind and will be subject to future\ninvestigation.\n3. Measurement AE r.m.s levels have been shown to be more sensitive to\nidentification of seeded defects on helical gears than vibration analysis.\n6 References\n[1] ISO 22096, 2007, \"Condition Monitoring and Diagnostics of Machines.
