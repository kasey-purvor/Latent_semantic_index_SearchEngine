This effect was largely reversed upon washout. \nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) or adrenoreceptor activation with \nnoradrenalin resulted in an ~35% block of the action potential that did not reverse \nduring a 30 min washout period.

In the absence of \nnoradrenalin, co-perfusion with \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor blockers resulted in non-\nreversible nerve failure indicating that tonic adrenoreceptor activation is required for \nnerve viability, while over activation of these receptors is also damaging.

Oligodendroglia exhibited \nregions of membrane vacuolization while profound changes were evident in \nastrocytes and included the presence of swollen and expanded mitochondria, \nvacuolization, cell processes disintegration and membrane breakdown. Blinded \nassessment revealed higher levels of astrocyte injury than oligodendroglial injury. The \nfindings show that over-activation of neurotransmitter receptors other than those for \nglutamate can produce extensive injury to developing white matter, a phenomenon \nthat may be clinically significant. \n \nPage 2 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 3 \n \nIntroduction \n Synaptic signalling between neurons is mediated by the vesicular release of \nneurotransmitters, an event that can also occur between neurons and glia. Functional \nglutamatergic synapses onto NG-2(+) glial cells have been identified in various brain \nregions in immature and mature animals (Paukert and Bergles 2006), while vesicular \nglutamate signalling between axons and neighbouring NG-2(+) cells has been \ndocumented in the corpus callosum and immature rat optic nerve (Kukley et al., 2007; \nZiskin et al., 2007). Ionotropic glutamatergic receptors are expressed by both \nastrocytes (e.g., Gallo and Ghiani 2000; Verkhratsky and Kirchhoff 2007) and \noligodendroglia (e.g., McDonald et al., 1998; Fern and Moller 2000; Follett et al., \n2000; Gallo and Ghiani 2000; Karadottir et al., 2005; Salter and Fern 2005; Micu et \nal., 2006), where there appears to be a polarized expression with NMDA receptors \nlargely found on the processes and non-NMDA receptors on the somata (Salter and \nFern 2005). We have recently shown functional glutamate uptake via high affinity \ntransporters into central axons (Arranz et al., 2008), in addition to functional synaptic-\ntype calcium channels and synaptic fusion type events in these axons during neonatal \ndevelopment (Alix et al., 2008). The presence of glutamate receptors on \noligodendrocytes confers sensitivity to excitotoxic injury, which may be significant \nclinically, in particular for conditions associated with developing white matter injury \nsuch as cerebral palsy (Fern and Moller 2000; Follett et al., 2000; Wilke et al., 2004; \nSalter and Fern 2005). \n A number of neurotransmitters other than glutamate have been shown to have \nactions upon central white matter, in particular during neonatal development. Several \nstudies reported endogenous GABA in the neonatal optic nerve (Lake 1992; Sakatani \net al., 1992; Ochi et al., 1993), while GABA-A receptor activation produces a partial \nnerve block in this preparation (Sakatani et al., 1991; Sakatani et al., 1992). This \neffect is associated with extracellular [K+] accumulation and axon depolarization \n(Simmonds 1983; Sakatani et al., 1994). Neonatal optic nerve nicotinic acetylcholine \nreceptor (nAChR) activation has a similar effect upon action potential conduction \n(Zhang et al., 2004), and the actions of both GABA-A and nAChR activation are \nlargely reversible. \u03b2-Adrenoreceptor or serotonin receptor activation also reversibly \neffects axon excitability in this preparation (Honmou and Young 1995; Saruhashi et \nal., 1997), while glycine receptor activation has a powerful depolarizing effect upon \nPage 3 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 4 \nthe membrane potential of neonatal optic nerve axons (Simmonds 1983). The \nsignificance of the expression of neurotransmitter receptors other than those for \nglutamate in developing central white matter for injury has not been examined and \nprevious studies have concentrated upon brief periods of receptor activation. In the \ncurrent study, we test the injury capacity of a standard 80 min period of glycine, \nnACh, adrenoreceptor or GABA receptor activation upon neonatal rat optic nerve. \nnAChR or adrenoreceptor activation were found to produce  non-reversible injury \ncharacterized by partial conduction block and glial cell pathology. The results reveal \nthe potential for non-glutamate mediated neurotransmitter-mediated injury in \ndeveloping matter injury. \n  \nMethods \n \nEthical approval \n All procedures were approved by local ethical review and conformed to UK \nhome office regulations. Animals were killed by vertebral dislocation. \n \nGeneral \nOptic nerves were excised from Lister-hooded rats aged between postnatal \ndays 7-15 (referred to as \"P10\" throughout), placed in an interface perfusion chamber \n(Medical Systems, Greenvale, New York, USA), and incubated for 60 min before \nrecordings were initiated. The nerves were maintained at 37 0C and perfused at a rate \nof 1.5-2.0 ml\/min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). The composition of the \naCSF was (in mM): NaCl, 126; KCl, 3; NaH2PO4, 2; MgSO4, 2; CaCl2, 2; NaHCO3, \n26; glucose, 10; pH, 7.45, bubbled with 5% CO2 \/ 95% O2. The osmolarity was \nmeasured and adjusted to 310-320 mOsmol by addition of NaCl, as required. Isolated \nnerves were continually aerated with 95%O2 \/ 5%CO2 at a flow rate of 3 L\/min.  \n \nElectrophysiology \n Extracellular compound action potentials were evoked and recorded with \nsuction electrodes. Individual nerves were electrically stimulated using square-wave \nconstant current pulses of 150-300 \u00b5sec duration (Iso stim A320, WPI), and \ncompound action potentials were recorded via a second electrode at the other nerve \nend (Cyber Amp 320, Axon Instruments). The recorded signal was subtracted from a \nPage 4 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 5 \nparallel differential electrode, filtered (low pass: 800-10000 Hz,), digitized (25000 \nHz: 1401 mini, Cambridge Electronic Design) and displayed on a PC running Signal \nsoftware (Cambridge Electronic Design) with positive (relative to the subtraction \nelectrode) going up. Peak-to-peak amplitude was used to assess changes in the \nnumber of unitary action potentials in the neonate since action potential area cannot \nbe reliably measured in recordings from neonatal nerves. This is due to the large \nstimulus artefact produced by the long stimulus duration that is required to elicit a full \nneonatal compound action potential (Fern et al., 1998; Foster et al., 1982).  \n All reagents used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (UK), except for \npicrotoxin and propranolol hydrochloride which were purchased from Tocris (UK). \nThe noradrenalin hydrochloride solutions included 0.6 mM ascorbic acid to reduce \noxidation. Experiments where noradrenalin or its antagonists were used were carried \nout in a dark room. The concentrations of neurotransmitters and antagonists used in \nthis study were chosen based upon published reports that have previously reported \neffects in isolated neonatal rat optic nerve (see Discussion).  \n \nElectron microscopy \nControl nerves were perfused for 120 min with aCSF and were compared to \nnerves perfused for 80 min with 100 \u00b5M noradrenalin + 50 \u00b5M nicotine followed by \n30 min washout using the standard protocol. Following perfusion, nerves were \nwashed in Sorenson\u2019s buffer prior to post-fixation in 3% glutaraldehyde\/Sorenson\u2019s \nfor 90 min at room temperature. They were then washed in Sorenson\u2019s 3 x 5 min and \nstored at 5 0C. Nerves were subsequently treated with 2% osmium tetroxide and \ndehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide. Sections were counterstained with uranyl \nacetate and lead citrate and examined with a Jeol 100CX electron microscope, see \nThomas et al., (2004) for further details. The preparation of the ultrathin sections for \nanalysis was performed blind by technical staff not associated with the project. \nDigital images of individual glial cells were processed using Photoshop \nsoftware (Adobe, San Jose, CA) and randomly allocated for blinded analysis of cell \ninjury (performed by SC). The scoring system used was as follows: 0 points = no \nsignificant pathology in the cell; 1 point  = some small vacuoles present in the \ncytoplasm; 2 points = large vacuoles present in the cytoplasm and\/or the presence of \nswollen mitochondria; 3 points = frank necrosis with breakdown of the cell \nmembrane. Cells were identified as either astrocyte or oligodendroglia using well-\nPage 5 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 6 \nestablished criteria for this preparation. In brief, oligodendroglial cells had a narrow \nendoplasmic reticulum, numerous mitochondria often clustered at one pole of the cell, \na clear cytoplasm containing a large nucleus with regular, dispersed, chromatin. \nAstrocytes featured a wide-bore endoplasmic reticulum, dark bodies in the cytoplasm, \nan irregular nucleus with chromatic clumped under the envelop and had a darker \ncytoplasm, see Thomas et al., (2004) and (Vaughn 1969) for further details. \n \nStatistics \n Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Significance was determined by \nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) using Tukey\u2019s post-test or by t-test, as appropriate. \n \nResults \n As previously reported (Fern et al., 1998), compound action potential \nrecordings from P10 rat optic nerve were stable during control perfusion with aCSF \n(action potential amplitude was 103.3 \u00b1 5.9% of the initial value after 120 min of \nperfusion with aCSF; n=5; Fig 1 B, C). Perfusion with aCSF containing 100 \u00b5M of \nthe inhibitory neurotransmitter glycine produced a gradual fall in compound action \npotential amplitude to 66.9 \u00b17.1% at the end of the period of glycine perfusion \n(P<0.005 vs., control; n= 6), recovering to 80.4 \u00b17.7% upon washout (not statistically \ndifferent from control, P>0.05). This effect was prevented by co-application of the \nselective glycine antagonist strychnine (2 \u00b5M; Fig 1 B). Perfusion with aCSF \ncontaining 100 \u00b5M of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA produced a more rapid \nfall in compound action potential amplitude to 82.9 \u00b17.4% by the end of a standard 80 \nmin perfusion period (P<0.001 vs., control; n= 7; Fig 1 C, D). The compound action \npotential amplitude recovered to 91.4 \u00b1 7.9% upon washout (P>0.05 vs., control). The \neffect of GABA upon the action potential was ablated by the GABA-A receptor \nantagonist picrotoxin (100 \u00b5M added 10 min prior to exposure to GABA and washed \nout with the neurotransmitter; Fig 1 C, D). \n \nFigure 1 near here \n \n The cholinergic agonist nicotine (50 \u00b5M) evoked a gradual decline in the P10 \noptic nerve compound action potential (Fig 2 A, C). Action potential amplitude fell to \n74.3 \u00b18.3% after 80 min exposure (P<0.005 vs., control, n= 6). Unlike the effect of \nPage 6 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 7 \nglycine and GABA, the fall in action potential amplitude evoked by nicotine was not \nreversed during a 30 min washout period (amplitude was 72.7 \u00b17.6% of the initial \nvalue after washout; P<0.005 vs., control). The cholinergic nicotinic antagonist \nmecamylamine blocked the effect of nicotine (10 \u00b5M added 10 min prior to exposure \nto nicotine and washed out with the neurotransmitter; Fig 2 B, C). \n \nFig 2 near here \n \n Perfusion with 100 \u00b5M of the adrenoreceptor agonist noradrenalin also \nresulted in a gradual decline in compound action potential amplitude, reaching 63.6 \n\u00b16.7% of the initial value after 80 min (n= 6, P<0.001 vs., control; Fig 3 A, B). As \nwith nicotine, the fall in action potential amplitude evoked by noradrenalin was not \nreversed during a 30 min washout period (amplitude was 70.2 \u00b17.1% of the initial \nvalue after washout; P<0.005 vs., control). The effect of noradrenalin was not \nsignificantly reduced by the \u03b2-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol (10 \u00b5M added 10 \nmin prior to exposure to noradrenalin and washed out with the neurotransmitter; Fig 3 \nB). Co-perfusion of propranolol and the \u03b1-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine \n(10 \u00b5M added as above), only served to increase the rate of action potential decline \nproduced by noradrenalin (Fig 3 B). This curious result may be explained by the \ndirect actions of adrenoreceptor blockers upon the compound action potential. \nPerfusion with 10 \u00b5M propranolol alone produced a fall in action potential amplitude \nto 69.1 \u00b16.9% after 80 min exposure (n= 7; P<0.001 vs., control; Fig 3 C). Washing \nout the \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonist resulted in action potential recovery to 86.0 \n\u00b111.0% (P>0.05 vs., control). The decline in the action potential evoked by \npropranolol was not enhanced by co-perfusion with phentolamine, while exposure to \nphentolamine alone had no significant effect (Fig 3 C). However, co-application of \npropranolol + phentolamine resulted in incomplete recovery during washout (73.1 \n\u00b18.9%; P<0.01 vs., control). Block of tonic adrenoreceptor activation therefore \nresulted in a degree of non-reversible block of optic nerve conduction, while over-\nactivation of adrenoreceptor had a similar effect. This suggests a complex relationship \nbetween adrenoreceptor activation and nerve viability, with either to much or too little \nadrenoreceptor activation leading to non-reversible effects. The reversible component \nof the effect of propranolol + phentolamine presumably explains the degree of \nPage 7 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 8 \nrecovery seen when these antagonists are washed off following co-application with \nadrenalin (Fig 3 b). \n \nFig 3 near here \n \n Nicotine or noradrenalin applied alone produced a largely non-reversible \nconduction block in the P10 optic nerve and the effects of co-application of both \nneurotransmitter were examined. Examples of compound action potentials recorded \nbefore, at the end of the 80 min exposure period, and after 30 min of washout are \nshown in Fig 4 A for 50 \u00b5M nicotine, 100 \u00b5M noradrenalin, and 50 \u00b5M nicotine + \n100 \u00b5M noradrenalin. The effect of co-exposure upon compound action potential \namplitude is shown in Fig 4 B, revealing a 64.0 \u00b14.8% decline (n = 11, P<0.001 vs., \ncontrol), with no significant recovery. The extent of conduction block and recovery \nfor all three conditions is summarized in Fig 4 C, revealing no significant difference \nbetween them. This may indicate a common mode of action between these conditions. \n \nFig 4 near here \n \n To examine the nature of the non-reversible effects of co-application of 50 \u00b5M \nnicotine + 100 \u00b5M noradrenalin, nerves were fixed at the end of the 30 min recovery \nperiod and processed for ultrastructural analysis. Control nerves perfused with aCSF \nfor 120 min contained axons, astrocytes and oligodendroglia of normal appearance for \nthis stage in development (Fig 5 A, B). The cell types were distinguished using well-\nestablished criteria (see Methods), and all cellular compartments were largely free \nfrom pathological changes. The health of glial cells was assessed blind using a simple \nscoring system (see Methods), revealing low levels of injury in the control perfused \nnerves and greatly increased levels of injury in the treated nerves (Fig 5 C).  The level \nof injury was significantly greater in astrocytes compared to oligodendroglia in the \ntreated nerves (P<0.005). Typical oligodendroglia from treated nerves are shown in \nFig 6, and exhibited an unusual localized bubbling or vesiculation of the somata cell \nmembrane with retention of relatively normal cytoplasmic inclusions such as \nmitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. The unusual vesicular breakdown of the \ncell membrane could also be observed in oligodendrocyte processes engaged in \nensheathing and myelinating axons (e.g., Fig 6 B: \"*\"). Axon cylinders appeared to be \nPage 8 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 9 \nunaffected by the exposure to the neurotransmitters and contained numerous \nmicrotubules and no evidence of axolemma breakdown or swelling, although the \nmyelin of the few axons that had initiated myelination appeared damaged.  \n \nFigs 5-6 near here. \n \n The ultrastructure of astrocytes in the optic nerves exposed to noradrenalin \nand nicotine was more profoundly affected than that of oligodendrocytes (Fig 7). \nTypical changes included the presence of very large and apparently swollen \nmitochondria, although these often retained an organized internal structure (Fig 7 A-\nC, long arrows). Membrane delineated clear vacuoles were often seen (Fig 7, \nasterisks), as well as swollen organelles, extensive regions of disintegrating cell \nmembrane (Fig 7, short arrows), and the presence of large areas of flocculent debris \nthat appeared to be degenerating cell processes. \n \nFig 7 near here \n \nDiscussion \n Previous studies have examined the acute effects of various neurotransmitters \nupon central white matter. Simmonds (1983) used grease-gap recording to \ndemonstrate reproducible depolarization of rat optic nerve axons upon exposure to \nglycine or the GABA-A agonist muscimol. Sakatani et al., (1991; 1992; 1994) \nshowed partial ablation of the compound action potential recorded from neonatal rat \noptic nerve following GABA-A receptor activation, an effect that was coupled to a \nrise in extracellular [K+] and axonal depolarization. A similar effect is seen in spinal \ndorsal column axons (Honmou et al., 1993; Lee et al., 1993), while GABA-B receptor \nactivation is protective of the optic nerve against ischemic injury (Fern et al., 1994; \n1995).  nAChR activation also partially abolishes the compound action potential in \nthe neonatal rat optic nerve (Zhang et al., 2004). In this case, nAChR activation \nproduces Ca2+ influx into axons, although the effect upon the compound action \npotential is not dependent upon the Ca2+ influx and does not involve a large axonal \ndepolarization (Zhang et al., 2004). nAChR activation can also modulate axonal \nexcitability in mature myelinated axons of the thalamocortical pathway (Kawai et al., \n2007). \u03b2-1 Adrenoreceptor activation increases the amplitude of sub-maximal \nPage 9 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 10 \ncompound action potentials in neonatal rat optic nerve in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, a \nphenomena that does not involve changes in extracellular [K+] (Honmou and Young \n1995). In all these studies, the period of receptor activation was relatively brief (<15 \nmin), and the effects were largely reversible. \n In the current study, 80 min perfusion with GABA or glycine suppressed the \nneonatal rat optic nerve compound action potential in a reversible fashion. In contrast, \nnAChR or adrenoreceptor activation for the same period had effects that were not \nreversed during a 30 min reperfusion period. The partial conduction failure induced \nby activation of nAChRs or adrenoreceptors was not associated with any clear axon \npathology, and the axons retained numerous microtubules, neurofilaments and \nmitochondria of a normal appearance. In contrast, widespread glial cell changes were \nevident and included a form of vacuolization of the oligodendroglial cell membrane \nand severe disruption of astrocytes. Astrocyte changes featured grossly enlarged \nmitochondria, generalized vacuolization, disintegration of processes and breakdown \nof the cell membrane. A blinded count of cell injury showed significantly more \nastrocyte than oligodendroglial cell damage. While many of the features of this injury \nare similar to those seen in glial cells following ischemia in this preparation (Thomas \net al., 2004; Wilke et al., 2004), unique features included the presence of regional \nmembrane vesiculation in oligodendroglial cells and the presence of expanded \nmitochondria retaining an internal structure in astrocytes. The absence of \nmorphological changes in axons suggests that it is the glial injury that underlies the \nnon-reversible conduction failure evoked by 80 min exposure to nAChR and \nadrenoreceptor activation. The absence of any significant increase in the level of \nconduction failure produced by co-activation of these receptors compared to the \neffects of a single agonist may indicate that a limit exists to the amount of conduction \nloss produced by acute glial injury. However, the extensive glial injury described here \nis likely to have further consequences for white matter function as reactive and \ndelayed glial changes progress. \n Glial cells are replete with neurotransmitter receptors. Cells of the \noligodendrocyte lineage can express functional adrenoreceptor, nAChRs, GABA-A \nreceptors and glycine receptors (Gilbert et al., 1984; Aoki 1992; Kirchhoff and \nKettenmann 1992; Berger et al., 1992; Cohen and Almazan 1993; Takeda et al., 1995; \nPastor et al., 1995; Wang and Lidow 1997; Belachew et al., 1998; Belachew et al., \n2000; Rogers et al., 2001; Khorchid et al., 2002a; Belachew and Gallo 2004; Oikawa \nPage 10 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 11 \net al., 2005). Astrocytes express a wide array of receptors, including nAChRs and \nadrenergic \u03b1-receptors capable of elevating intracellular Ca2+ (e.g., Duffy and \nMacVicar 1995; Mantyh et al., 1995; Sharma and Vijayaraghavan 2001). Astrocyte \nglycine receptor expression may be restricted to cells in the spinal cord (Pastor et al., \n1995; Kirchhoff et al., 1996), while GABA-A receptor expression has been observed \nin a variety of astrocyte populations, including neonatal optic nerve astrocytes (Butt \nand Jennings 1994). Glycine and GABA-A receptor activation evokes depolarization \nin neonatal astrocytes and cells of the oligodendroglial line due to the opening of a \nchloride conductance. The amplitude of the depolarization is unlikely to activate \npotential routes of Ca2+ influx such as Ca2+ channels or reverse Na-Ca exchange, and \nthere are no reports of elevations in glial Ca2+ following activation of either glycine or \nGABA-A receptors. Since nAChR activation can evoke Ca2+ rises in both astrocytes \nand oligodendroglia, while adrenergic \u03b1-receptors are documented to have the same \neffect at least in astrocytes, there is a good correlation between neonatal optic nerve \ninjury and prolonged activation of neurotransmitter receptors that are capable of \nelevating Ca2+ in glia. Alternatively, adrenoreceptor over activation can lead to glial \ninjury following oxidative stress, although this occurs via delayed mechanisms \n(Khorchid et al., 2002b). \n Micro-dialysis measurements show large ischemic rises in the extracellular \nconcentration of GABA and glycine in central white matter (Shimada et al., 1993), \nand the current results indicate that these are unlikely to be damaging, although a \nchronic effect upon conduction is possible (Sakatani et al., 1993). While it is known \nthat acetylcholine and adrenergic agonists such as noradrenalin are released into the \nextracellular space of the CNS during ischemia (e.g., Richards et al., 1993; \nYamamuro et al., 1996; Uchihashi et al., 1998), recordings of resting and ischemic \nlevels in brain white matter are lacking. The partial conduction block produced by \nadrenoreceptor antagonists in the current study indicates tonic receptor activation in \nwhite matter, and is consistent with the presence of an endogenous release mechanism \npotentially capable of elevating extracellular noradrenalin to toxic levels during \nischemia.  \n Several observations suggest that the clinical significance of the toxic effects \nof nAChR and adrenoreceptor activation in central white matter may be high. The \ndevelopmental disorder cerebral palsy is associated with white matter injuries that are \nPage 11 of 26\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nGLIA\n 12 \nthought to be ischemic in origin. The affected structures are likely to experience \nelevated levels of extracellular noradrenalin and acetylcholine during ischemia, either \nfollowing release of endogenous pools of the neurotransmitters or indirectly from \nneighbouring grey matter structures. Indeed, there is an association between maternal \nsmoking and the incidence of perinatal white matter brain injury (e.g., Froen et al., \n2002), while early exposure to nicotine can result in selective white matter \nabnormalities (e.g., Abdel-Rahman et al., 2005; Froen et al., 2002; Jacobsen et al., \n2007). These effects are consistent with the elevated expression in developing central \nwhite matter structures of both nAChR (Swanson et al., 1987; Zhang et al., 2004) and \nadrenoreceptors (Dawidek and Robinson 1993; Happe et al., 2004; Sanders et al., \n2005). Other potential clinical links to the current findings include the noted absence \nof \u03b22\u2212adrenoreceptor expression in astrocytes of patients with multiple sclerosis (De \nKeyser et al., 2004). The current result showing that tonic \u03b2\u2212adrenoreceptor \nactivation is required if white matter function is to be maintained may therefore have \nrelevance for white matter injury in post-neonatal disorders such as multiple sclerosis. \n \nFigure legends \nFigure 1 \nGlycine or GABA-A receptor activation has reversible effects upon the compound \naction potential recorded from the P10 rat optic nerve.
