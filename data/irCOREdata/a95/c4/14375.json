Radiant Thinking\nreflects your internal structure and processes. The Mind Map is your external\nmirror of your own Radiant Thinking and allows you to access this vast thinking\npowerhouse.' Tony Buzan (1993).\nDefinition\nAuto-monitoring is a technique of personal or group knowledge-presentation and re-presenta-\ntion. Such techniques are often supported by computer applications that make graphical\nrepresentations of knowledge structures. This process is at the core of what is called concept\nmapping.\nContext and background\nLearning technology comprises a collection of pragmatic and theoretical positions on the way\nlearners come to know and teachers provide the appropriate experiences. At its core is a\ndeveloping design philosophy that uses instructional design theory or educational technology.\nWithin learning technology is an interest in what some might call content free courseware or\nMindtools (Kommers 1992). The idea of using concept maps (Novak and Gowin 1984) or\nmind maps (Buzan 1993) as part of an instructional strategy is not new (Bogden 1977;\n38\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nReader and Hammond 1993), but it is timely to consider the contribution that such techniques\nhave made to learning technology. This paper sets out a theoretical base for thinking about\nconcept maps. Earlier attempts have suggested some elements in the process (Deikhoff 1982;\nGold 1984; McAleese 1985; McAleese 1987; McAleese 1990; McAleese 1992). The principal\nidea behind such tools is that of auto-monitoring - the ability of learners to develop thinking\nskills. The term auto-monitoring (A\/M) will be used here to encompass components of\nMindtools, mind maps, concept mapping, thinking skills, and so on.\nBefore directly addressing the theory behind A\/M, however, it will be useful to take as a\nspringboard the current debate in higher education. The main strand to this background is the\nneed for students to acquire study skills. The need for better learning and study skills in a\nsignificant sector of the student population is identified in the Howie Report (1992), the\nMacFarlane Report (1993), the Edinburgh University CRLI Report on the Transition from\nSchool to Higher Education in Scotland (Wall et al 1991) and the Report of the National\nCommission on Education {Learning to Succeed 1993). All these sources identify the need for\nstudents in higher education to be able to think and to develop critical thinking skills.\nCognitive tools\nA realistic starting point is what has been called situated cognition (Brown et al 1989) The\nmost useful contribution is the claim that concepts are both situated and progressively devel-\noped through activity. Knowledge is claimed to be like tools, and thinking occurs when the\n\"tools are used for some task. Brown et al (1989) and Carroll (1989), along with many others,\nprovide a stable raft of research supporting the idea of conceptual tools. A\/M is the executive\ncontrol and operation of such tools (for example, Clancey 1993). Not everyone is convinced\nthat there are practical applications for situated cognition, but it does provide a scaffolding for\nthe argument (Hoppe 1993). A\/M is the craft that the apprentice is acquiring in formal and\ninformal education. That is, the learner is acquiring the skills needed to operate with and on\nconcepts. Some would argue that this is also the function of language, namely a means by\nwhich learners can operate on concepts. Learning, seen in this way, is the outcome of learner\nactivity. It is something learners cause by their.actions: learning is a process of re-constructing\nand re-presenting what is known (Arzi and West 1986). A\/M is therefore based on a set of\nassumptions and procedures that allow learners to be and to become responsible for their own\nlearning. Learning is seen as being something that occurs as a result of student\/learner\nactivities.\nAn A\/M model for concept mapping\nFigures 1 and 2 indicate the main components and suggest their interdependencies.\nThe learner is engaged in a cognitively active process in an environment that supports the\nmanipulation of knowledge artefacts: ideas, concepts etc. The general process can be called\nengagement. The learning arena is the virtual space where operations on entities occur. In this\nspace, the learner is able to engage with representations of information, ideas and concepts.\nThis is a type of rhetorical space (Scardamelia and Bereiter 1987). It is not constrained except\nwith the application of a cognitive template (see Streitz and Hammeman 1990). The engage-\nment occurs at two levels. First, the operational level where the computer interface allows\nnodes to be moved, nodes created, etc. Secondly, the cognitive level where thinking occurs. In\ngeneral thinking precedes operations; however, operations will precipitate thinking, and there\n39\nRay McAleese A theoretical view on concept mapping\n\u2022 node creation\n\u2022 node deletion\n\u2022 linking\n- ^\n\/Tools)\nt^^nnatioi,,-concept\n\u2022 ~ ~ - -\nLearning Arena\nQ7mplate<r^)\ntf \u2022 network\n' \u2022 procedure\n\u2022 heirarchy .\nENGAGEMENT\nV\n\/Stages A\nV inA\/M )\nSI.

This accession is dynamic - that is, it occurs while operations are on-going in\nthe arena. Ideas are created on the fly, concepts are recalled when appropriate, and so forth.\nThe learner has tools to use and operates through a series of stages (Figure 2), though the\nstages, while explicit and sequential in terms of the operations, need not necessarily be\nfollowed. Acknowledgement is the state of initial awareness: the learner thinks about some\nconcept.\nRepresentation is the formal activity allowed by the tools (for example, concept label crea-\ntion). Viewing is the core activity of being perceptually aware of the entities in the learning\narena. There is a loop between representation and viewing. Checking is a process whereby\nconcept labels are compared, link values are scrutinized, and the learner attempts to make\nsense of the nodes, links, etc. Resolution is required when conflicts occur in labelling or\nlinking. The processes of viewing, checking and resolving operate a loop. Confirming in-\nAcknowledgement\nConfirming\n\u2022 Re\nFigure 2: The stages of\nAIM\n40\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nvolves operations such as agreeing that the representation is what was intended and has no\ninconsistencies. Confirming is a form of commitment (see below).\nIn addition, the learner has available a number of templates that constrain the operations\nperformed. In general, the principal template is the net, consisting of nodes and links. Con-\nceptually the net is n-dimensional. The tools are the computer-related operations using a\nWIMP (graphical) interface. Tools will change with the instantiation of different templates. In\ngeneral, tools will allow representation of elements of templates to be manipulated. For\nexample, nodes can be moved, created, deleted, and the like. Although the net is the most\npopular template, the outline or constrained net is also useful. The outline is a hierarchy, and\nthe freedom to manipulate concepts is pre-determined by an [is-a] relation:\n(B - is-a - A -> B has attributes of A)\nProcesses are cognitive operations that operate on their own or in conceit with engagement.\nProcesses are dependent on the template selected. For example, in a hierarchy template there\nis an inheritance influence on the operations. Dependencies are created and attribute effects\nare transmitted through the underlying structure.\nAn operational definition of A\/M in concept maps\nLearners represent concepts, and in so doing make propositions. Kathleen Fisher calls these\npropositions instances in SemNet - Semantic Net (Fisher et al 1990). Here ambiguities arise,\npropositions suggest other propositions, and elements in the propositions need disambiguation\n- that is, differentiating and integrating. The learner will experience dissonance and will have\nto make commitments. This state leads to a heightened awareness of what is known and what\nis not (McAleese 1985). Tacit or ill-remembered ideas are exteriorized through engagement\nwith represented propositions (Pask 1984). The acquisition of knowledge (that is, the outcome\nof activities) is a negotiated state. Meaning is negotiated by resolving and making explicit\nconcepts, their attributes, etc. (Moyse 1991).\nFigure 3: Activities,\nprocesses and\nvisualisation\nPrior\nKnowledge\nPROCES\nAccomodation\nDifferentiation\nIntegration\nContextualising\nExemplifying\nDissonance\nLearner\n1.

A theoretical view on concept mapping\nThis activity is operationalized in the WIMP interface. Mouse movement indicates, but does\nnot determine, point of view (Fairchild 1993); node creation (involving several sub-actions\ndepending on the A\/M application) indicates the exteriorization of a prepositional element;\nlinking nodes indicates the explication of the proposition. Nodes are represented by an\nimplicit semantic distance (Holley and Dansereau 1988). The processes at work are general\ncognitive processes of accommodation, differentiation, etc. The computer's role is to manage\nthe activities and to provide a virtual learning arena where actions and intentions can be seen,\nrecorded and if necessary replayed. The computer, while not essential to A\/M, is thus a\npowerful adjunct in the supportive learning environment.\nA key aspect of A\/M is visualization. While a graphical representation is not necessary for\nA\/M to occur, it does seem that the ability to see the results of thinking has a strong effect on\nthe process. Work by Piagetian thinkers suggests that the concrete portrayal of abstract, ill-\nconceived ideas is an important precursor to problem solving. There is compelling evidence\nfrom research in information management that graphical metaphors facilitate the specification\nof intent and the presentation of choices. Indeed, work on degrees of interest, for example\nfish-eye viewers, suggests that data-presentation techniques are not only important in han-\ndling large numbers of nodes and relationships, but also allow learners to make use of differ-\nent perspectives on the same data set concurrently (Fairchild 1993). Figure 3 provides further\nexplanation.\nVisualization and the problem of scale\nThe above model suggests an over-arching process of visualization to encompass the process\nby which learners make sense of the web of interconnected concept labels. As long as the\nlearning arena is a bounded 2-dimensional area, the problem of too many concepts does not\narise. However, sooner or later learners create many nodes and wish to make many associa-\ntions. The problem of visualizing large semantic spaces has been tackled by MCC (Microelec-\ntronics and Computer Technology Corporation) with their work on SemNet (the name is the\nsame as that used by Kathleen Fisher for her SemNet, based on Novak et al, referred to\npreviously). SemNet research at MCC suggests that in visualization, three states for learners\nare important:\n\u2022 they must be able to identify (see) individual concept labels;\n\u2022 the relative positions of concept labels must be obvious in the semantic space (the\nlearning arena);\n\u2022 learners must be able easily to detect relationships between concept labels.\nIn addition, learners must be able to make sense of the dimensions of the space. A learning\narena portrayed on a computer screen is confined by the 2-dimensional window. Judicious use\nof overviews and fish-eye views can make the space more extensive. SemNet by MCC used\nthe idea of point-of-view very effectively to reduce complexity and to show, at the same time,\nthe relevant nodes. In general, the 2-dimensional space is concerned only with semantic\ncloseness. Learners can place concept labels as closely or as remotely as they choose. The\nmeaning of the location is known only to the individual who creates the network. I have\nsuggested that two views are of particular value:.terrain views and street views (McAleese\n1983). In the former, the learner is able to see the extent and context of knowledge proposi-\ntions. In the latter, the learner sees the detail and relative interdependencies.\n42\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nBacking and warrant\nThe main problem is that A\/M is such a universal concept that it draws on a wide range of\ndeveloped areas of understanding. Therefore, the number of related ideas that contribute to\nthe thinking on A\/M is open to debate and question. The influences on A\/M range from\nconstructivist positions explaining the way learners make sense, to normative positions that\nargue for active reflective learners who debate and evaluate data with a degree of rigour. The\ntension between a description of 'how it is ' and a description of 'how it should be' is not\nunique to A\/M. The key result influences are concept mapping, meta-cognition, and reflective\npractice, though these areas are not mutually exclusive.\nConcept mapping - key points\nThe technique is usually associated in this context with Joseph Novak (Novak and Gowin\n1984). Concept maps represent meaningful relationships between entities (concepts) in the\nform of propositions. A proposition is two or more concept labels linked by a labelled rela-\ntionship in a semantic unit (see also Fisher et al 1990 for her work on SemNet). A concept\nmap, according to Novak and other 'mappers' is a technique for externalizing concept labels\nand propositions created by concept labels and relationships. The key points are as follows.\n\u2022 Meaningful relationships - the representations make sense to the learner. They may\nor may not be true - it is possible to have a raft of untrue meaningful relationships.\nIndeed, many learners do have such entities, especially in their understanding of\nbasic science.\n\u2022 Concept labels - the representation is a label or a sign for something that is signi-\nfied. Therefore, the sign { m o l e c u l e } is a sign for a chemical entity that consists\nof atoms held together and acting in a specified way.\n\u2022 Propositions - the meaningful units make sense according to the learner. Therefore,\n'{isomers} have {n different forms}' is a proposition created by two concept labels\nand one relationship. In this case, the relationship is of special form - it indicates an\nattribute of the first concept (see McAleese 1990 for a more detailed view of the\nsyntax of such propositions).\nThe mind map and flowscape\nMany other authors have contributed to the understanding of concept maps, most notably\nTony Buzan (mind maps), and recently Edward de Bono (flowscapes).\nThe mind map (Buzan 1993) is a formalized procedure for using associations to create a\npictorial representation of one or more ideas. The technique relies on brain-storming. The\nprecise mapping between cortical function and the neuro-physiology of brain cells to bitmaps\nand 'clickable objects' on a computer screen remains uncertain. It is very tempting to say the\nmind map - or other concept map - can be isomorphic with 'understandings' as they are or\nmust be, in the brain. Not even Buzan or de Bono would go that far, yet the metaphor is very\napt, and Buzan's lucid writing makes many learners perform more effectively by providing a\nplausible study technique. Learners do seem to improve their overall performance in inde-\npendent tests when they have 'sorted out their thinking' using a mind map. De Bono, using\nthe flowscape (De Bono 1993), takes a very similar approach to Buzan. He has deeper roots in\nPiaget, but the technique of brain-storming creates the network or flowscape.\n43\nRay McAleese '\u2022 A theoretical view on concept mapping\nDe Bono takes the argument further by insisting that it is the dynamic nature of the intercon-\nnections that creates what he likes to call water logic. That is, a dynamic form of associations\nwhich is more concerned with what 'will happen' or 'becomes', than what 'is'. An important\nfeature of the flowscape is the identification of clusters of concepts that are or become\ninterdependent. They form loops, and de Bono uses such ideas in a diagnostic fashion to help\nlearners identify key areas of thinking.\nGood or bad maps?\nMany workers have tried to score or evaluate maps. In particular, Novak has suggested, along\nwith Gowin, two methods of scoring or formalizing thinking. Novak's technique is based on a\ndetailed application of Ausubel (Novak and Gowin 1984). The degree of subsumption and\ndifferentiation, along with levels of differentiation, can be used to score a map once created.\nThis technique does not address an ongoing evaluative function that may act as control over\nlearners. Learners can only use a post-production facility.\nThe place of commitment\nBuzan and others suggest that there is an affective aspect to mapping. There has to be a\ncommitment to the consequences of what is emerging. It is as if the creation of maps leads to\na contract that the learner adopts. An idea that associates with this is cognitive dissonance\n(Festinger 1957). Cognitive dissonance is the state of mind that occurs when there is a tension\nbetween what should be and what is. Ideas conflict, and there is dissonance between concepts,\npositions and relationships that requires resolution. Often this happens when differentiation or\nintegration occur. Two concepts are so similar that one label can be used to denote them. The\nassociation with Festinger is that cognitive dissonance involves not only cognitive attributes\nbut affective attributes. In one sense, this is the tension between what 'I think I know' and 'I\ncan re-present what I know'.\nCommitment to a re-presentation may be dangerous as it fixes the players and their positions.\nIn essence, there is always going to be cognitive dissonance in A\/M, as dissonance is a\ncreative tension (see Dole and Niederhauser 1990). It drives the process by 'looking for' a\nstate of rest or resolution. Dissonance is the cybernetic oil that makes the process work.\nConsequently, commitment to maps created during A\/M is not necessary.\nMeta-cognition\nMeta-cognition generally refers to awareness of knowledge and an ability to comprehend,\ncontrol and manipulate cognitive processes. The rather crude term helicoptering has been\napplied to the state in which learners can see their own conceptual terrain. They can rise\nabove their understandings and explore their cognitive space as it is. This description seems\nvery close to what is implied by auto-monitoring. The principal flaw here lies in the state of\nthe conceptual terrain: the metaphor breaks down as the conceptual landscape does not\nnecessarily exist prior to 'levitation'. A\/M creates the terrain as well as providing a vehicle for\nviewing its topography. This distinction can be implied by that made by Buzan between 'note\ntaking' and 'note making'. In the former, the terrain is almost complete; in the latter, the\nterrain is still evolving. Note making is rather akin to helicoptering above a volcanic eruption\nwhere the new terrain is still being formed. In a recent review, Osman and Hannifin (1992)\nsuggest that the principal components for meta-cognition are:\n44\nAIT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\n\u2022 meta-memory - knowledge and awareness of strategic behaviours and memory\nsystems;\n\u2022 meta-comprehension - the conscious process of knowing about comprehending and\nknowing how to comprehend;\n\u2022 self-regulation - the continuous fine tuning by learners in response to and in the\nabsence of knowledge of results concerning cognitive errors;\n\u2022 schema training - the development of cognitive structures providing a framework\nfor comprehension (schemas help learners generate perspectives that can be tested,\nreconciled and reconstructed with new engagements);\n\u2022 transfer - the application of one set of procedures or skills to a different situation\n(transfer can be either vertical or lateral).\nFrom the above conditions, it is apparent that meta-cognition is associated with reflective\npractice, to which I now turn.\nReflective practice\nReflective practice, according to Schon (1983, 1988), is the integration of thought and\npractice. It involves thinking critically and analysing actions, goals and activity. The reflec-\ntive practitioner assumes the perspective of an external observer and speculates on how\npractice is effected (Kottkamp 1990; Osterman 1990; Peters 1991). According to Peters\n(1992), '[reflective practice] is a special kind of practice [...] that involves a systematic\ninquiry into the practice itself.'\nEducators have become familiar with the concept of reflective practice through SchSn's\n(1983, 1988) writings about reflective practitioners. Schon's work has a historical foundation\nin a tradition of learning supported by Dewey, Lewin and Piaget, each of whom advocated\nthat learning is dependent on the integration of experience with reflection and of theory with\npractice. Although each argued that experience is the basis for learning, each also maintained\nthat learning cannot take place without reflection. In reflective practice, reflection is the\nessential part of the learning process because it results in niaking sense of or extracting\nmeaning from the experience (Osterman 1990). For Schon (1988), the stage is set for reflec-\ntion when 'knowing-in-action' - the sort of knowledge that professionals come to depend on\nto perform their work spontaneously - produces an unexpected outcome or surprise. This\nsurprise can lead to one of two kinds of reflection: reflection on action, which occurs either\nfollowing or by interrupting the activity, or reflection in action, which occurs during (without\ninterrupting) the activity by thinking about how to re-shape the activity while it is under way\n(ERIC 1992).\nKottkamp (1990) uses the terms offline and online to distinguish between reflection-on-action\nand reflection-in-action. Reflection-on-action takes place after the activity (that is, offline),\nwhen full attention can be given to analysis without the necessity for immediate action and\nwhen there are opportunities for the professional to receive assistance from others. Reflection-\nin-action, which occurs during the event, may be more effective in improving practice.\nConclusion\nThis paper suggests a theoretical framework for auto-monitoring. Without some form of\nwarrant to concept mapping, the development of applications will be driven by available\n45\nRay McAleese A theoretical view on concept mapping\ntechnology, or what can be done rather than what is useful. The central argument is that a\nprocess entitled auto-monitoring exists which is best seen as a learning arena. In this arena,\nlearners can be aware of and manipulate learning activities as if they were a form of Lego or\nMeccano. The outcome of such operations is called a concept map. Maps are not the purpose,\nbut rather an artefact of a process by which learning occurs.\nAcknowledgements\nThe thinking reported in this paper was supported by the Courseware for Learning Study\nSkills (CLASS) project as part of the TLTP (I) initiative.
