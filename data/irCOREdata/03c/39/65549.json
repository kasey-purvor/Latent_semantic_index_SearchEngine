In the case of soluble factors, the principal\ntargeting motifs are N-terminal signal peptides that direct\nclassical secretory proteins to the translocation machinery of\nthe ER (Keenan et al., 2001). However, for a number of soluble\nfactors with defined extracellular functions, it has been\ndemonstrated that ER\/Golgi-independent routes of protein\nsecretion exist (Muesch et al., 1990; Rubartelli and Sitia, 1991;\nCleves, 1997; Hughes, 1999; Nickel, 2003; Prudovsky et al.,\n2003). Among these, the most prominent examples are the\nangiogenic growth factors FGF-1 (Jackson et al., 1992;\nJackson et al., 1995; Shin et al., 1996; LaVallee et al., 1998;\nTarantini et al., 1998; Landriscina et al., 2001a; Landriscina et\nal., 2001b; Prudovsky et al., 2002; Mandinova et al., 2003) and\nFGF-2 (Mignatti and Rifkin, 1991; Mignatti et al., 1992;\nFlorkiewicz et al., 1995; Trudel et al., 2000; Engling et al.,\n2002), cytokines like interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL1\u03b2) (Rubartelli et al.,\n1990; Andrei et al., 1999; Andrei et al., 2004) and migration\ninhibitory factor (MIF) (Flieger et al., 2003) as well as the\ngalectin protein family, lectins of the extracellular matrix\n(Cooper and Barondes, 1990; Cleves et al., 1996; Lutomski et\nal., 1997). These and other unconventional secretory proteins\nare characterized by the lack of a signal peptide, by not being\nglycosylated (despite bearing multiple consensus sites for this\npost-translational modification) and, most importantly, by an\nexport mechanism that is fully functional in the presence of\nbrefeldin A (Cleves, 1997; Hughes, 1999; Nickel, 2003), a drug\nthat blocks ER\/Golgi-dependent protein transport (Misumi et\nal., 1986; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989; Orci et al., 1991).\n517\nLeishmania HASPB is a lipoprotein that is exported to the\nextracellular space from both Leishmania parasites and\nmammalian cells via an unconventional secretory pathway.\nExported HASPB remains anchored in the outer leaflet\nof the plasma membrane mediated by myristate and\npalmitate residues covalently attached to the N-terminal\nSH4 domain of HASPB. HASPB targeting to the plasma\nmembrane depends on SH4 acylation that occurs at\nintracellular membranes. How acylated HASPB is targeted\nto the plasma membrane and, in particular, the subcellular\nsite of HASPB membrane translocation is unknown. In\norder to address this issue, we screened for clonal CHO\nmutants that are incapable of exporting HASPB. A detailed\ncharacterization of such a CHO mutant cell line revealed\nthat the expression level of the HASPB reporter molecule\nis unchanged compared to CHO wild-type cells; that it is\nboth myristoylated and palmitoylated; and that it is mainly\nlocalized to the plasma membrane as judged by confocal\nmicroscopy and subcellular fractionation.

From these data, we conclude that\nthe subcellular site of HASPB membrane translocation\nis the plasma membrane as the reporter molecule\naccumulates in this location when export is blocked. Thus,\nthese results allow us to define a two-step process of HASPB\ncell surface biogenesis in which SH4 acylation of HASPB\nfirstly mediates intracellular targeting to the plasma\nmembrane.

HASPB is exclusively\nexpressed in infective parasites in both extracellular\nmetacyclics and intracellular amastigotes of L. major and L.\ndonovani (Rangarajan et al., 1995; McKean et al., 1997; Alce\net al., 1999) suggesting a role in parasite virulence, although\ngene deletion mutants retain their viability in the host (McKean\net al., 2001). Intriguingly, following heterologous expression,\nHASPB is also externalized by mammalian cells (Denny et al.,\n2000) suggesting that endogenous factors exist in higher\neukaryotes that are exported in a mechanistically similar\nmanner.\nHASPB contains an N-terminal SH4 domain that becomes\ndually acylated by myristoylation of glycine 2 and\npalmitoylation of cysteine 5 (Denny et al., 2000). These post-\ntranslational modifications are essential for HASPB targeting to\nthe cell surface of Leishmania parasites (Pimenta et al., 1994;\nDenny et al., 2000). Interestingly, the extreme N-terminus of\nHASPB (HASPB-N18) is sufficient for targeting of HASPB-\nN18-GFP to the cell surface (Denny et al., 2000). A\nmyristoylated HASPB mutant that cannot be palmitoylated\n(HASPBC5S-GFP) has been found to localize to Golgi\nmembranes (Denny et al., 2000) suggesting that HASPB\nassociates at least transiently with membranes of the\nclassical secretory pathway. Therefore, even though\npalmitoylacyltransferase activities have not only been localized\nto the Golgi but also to the ER and plasma membranes\n(reviewed by Bijlmakers and Marsh, 2003), it is likely that\ntransfer of palmitate to the SH4 domain of HASPB occurs at\nthe Golgi. Following palmitoylation, HASPB is transferred to\nthe plasma membrane but the mechanism of this transport\nprocess is unknown. Interestingly, HASPB surface expression\nin mammalian cells is not affected by brefeldin A (Denny et al.,\n2000), making it unlikely that dually acylated HASPB reaches\nthe plasma membrane bound to the cytoplasmic leaflet of\nsecretory vesicles. Based on these considerations, HASPB\ntrafficking appears to be distinct from all three known classes\nof plasma membrane-targeted proteins carrying dual acylation\nmotifs at their N-termini (Bijlmakers and Marsh, 2003). The\nfirst of these, the Src kinase Lck, is palmitoylated at the Golgi\nfollowed by brefeldin A-sensitive transport to the plasma\nmembrane (Bijlmakers and Marsh, 1999; Bijlmakers and\nMarsh, 2003). Secondly, G\u03b1\u03b6 subunits of plasma membrane-\nresident trimeric G proteins are transiently associated with\nintracellular membranes like Lck, but these factors get\npalmitoylated at the plasma membrane and transport to this site\nis fully operational in the presence of brefeldin A (Fishburn\net al., 1999; Bijlmakers and Marsh, 2003). Finally, a third\nmechanism of plasma membrane targeting of N-terminally\nacylated proteins is exemplified by the Src kinase Fyn that does\nnot appear to contact intracellular membranes but rather is\ndirectly targeted from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane.\nConsistently, brefeldin A does not affect Fyn targeting (van\u2019t\nHof and Resh, 1997; Bijlmakers and Marsh, 2003). As indicated\nabove, current knowledge about HASPB targeting to the plasma\nmembrane does not fit with any of these examples as HASPB\nis transiently associated with, and most likely palmitoylated at,\nthe Golgi followed by plasma membrane targeting in a brefeldin\nA-insensitive manner (Denny et al., 2000).\nBased on these considerations, many questions about the\nmolecular mechanism of HASPB targeting to the plasma\nmembrane remain unresolved. There is also a complete lack of\nknowledge about the subcellular site of membrane translocation\nof HASPB, a process that eventually allows HASPB exposure\non the cell surface of eukaryotic cells. In the current study, we\nintroduce a novel experimental system that permits the precise\nquantification of HASPB export from mammalian cells based\non flow cytometry. Using this assay, we screened for somatic\nCHO mutants that are incapable of exporting HASPB-GFP\nfusion protein employing retroviral insertion mutagenesis.\nBased on a detailed biochemical and morphological\ncharacterization of a mutant with this phenotype, we conclude\nthat the site of HASPB membrane translocation is the plasma\nmembrane. These data suggest that in the CHO mutant\ndescribed, a component of a plasma membrane-resident\nmachinery has been disrupted causing the fully acylated\nHASPB-GFP reporter molecule to accumulate in the inner\nleaflet of the plasma membrane. These results support a two-\nstep process of HASPB biogenesis, in which dual acylation of\nthe HASPB SH4 domain is required for delivery to the inner\nleaflet of the plasma membrane and subsequent recognition by\na putative translocation machinery. Intriguingly, the component\nof the HASPB export apparatus that has been disrupted in the\nmutant cell line appears to be specific for this export pathway,\nas the angiogenic growth factor FGF-2, another protein secreted\nby unconventional means, is found to be exported normally\nfrom the HASPB export mutant cell line.\nMaterials and Methods\nAntibodies\nAffinity-purified anti-GFP antibodies were generated as described\nearlier (Engling et al., 2002; Seelenmeyer et al., 2003). Antibodies\ndirected against the transferrin receptor were from Zymed, antibodies\ndirected against GM130 were purchased from BD Transduction\nLaboratories. Monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies were obtained from\ncell culture supernatants of the hybridoma cell line Okt4 (ATCC CRL-\n8002). APC-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies\nused for FACS analyses were from Molecular Probes.\nGeneration of HASPB-GFP fusion protein expressing cell lines\nAll HASPB fusion proteins used in this study are based on enhanced\nGFP (Clontech). The 18 N-terminal amino acids of HASPB\n(MGSSCTKDSAKEPQKRAD) were fused to the N-terminus of\neGFP through a short linker sequence (GPVAT). In case of HASPB-\nN18-GFP \u2206myr\/palm and HASPB-N18-GFP \u2206palm, two single\namino acid changes were introduced to prevent myristoylation and\npalmitoylation (G2A), and palmitoylation (C5S), respectively. All\nconstructs were cloned into the retroviral expression vector pREV-\nTRE2 that contains a doxicycline-dependent promoter. Generation of\nCHO cell lines expressing the various HASPB fusion proteins\nemploying retroviral transduction was performed as described\npreviously (Engling et al., 2002).\nBiochemical analysis of membrane association of HASPB-\nGFP fusion proteins\nCHO cells expressing the various kinds of HASPB-GFP fusion\nproteins were cultured for 2 days at 37\u00b0C in the presence of doxicycline\n(1 \u00b5g\/ml). Following detachment using PBS\/EDTA, cells were\ncollected by centrifugation (500 g, 5 minutes) and resuspended in\nPBS\/sucrose (10% w\/w) homogenization buffer. Cells were broken up\nJournal of Cell Science 118 (3)\nJo\nur\nna\nl o\nf C\nel\nl S\nci\nen\nce\n519HASPB export across the plasma membrane\nby sonication and then ultracentrifuged for 60 minutes at 100,000 g.\nThe resulting supernatant was defined as the cytosolic fraction, the\nsediment was resuspended in homogenization buffer and defined as the\nmembrane fraction. For carbonate extraction experiments, membranes\nwere again collected by ultracentrifugation. Following resuspension in\nNa2CO3 (0.1 M, pH 11.5), the samples were incubated for 30 minutes\nat 4\u00b0C. Membranes were re-isolated by ultracentrifugation and\nseparated into supernatant (peripheral membrane proteins) and\nmembrane sediment (integral and tightly associated proteins).\nMetabolic labeling of CHO cells using [3H]myristate and\n[3H]palmitate\nCHO cells expressing HASPB-GFP fusion proteins were grown on\nsix-well plates for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C in the presence of doxicycline (1\n\u00b5g\/ml) to about 80% confluency. Following 2 hours of incubation\nin FCS-free medium, cells were incubated in FCS-free medium\ncontaining either 250 \u00b5Ci [3H]palmitic acid or 100 \u00b5Ci [3H]myristic\nacid. After 3 hours of incubation in labeling medium at 37\u00b0C, cells\nwere washed and lysed in buffer containing detergent by sonication.\nFollowing removal of insoluble material by centrifugation (14,000 g,\n10 minutes), the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation of\nHASPB-GFP fusion proteins employing affinity-purified anti-GFP\nantibodies. Antibody-bound protein was eluted with SDS sample\nbuffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For this purpose, the samples\nwere split into two fractions in order to analyze the eluted proteins by\nboth fluorography and silver staining. For fluorography, SDS gels\nwere treated with NAMP100 amplifier solution (Amersham) and then\ndried for exposure using HyperfilmTM (Amersham). Typically, SDS\ngels containing [3H]myristic acid-labeled proteins were exposed for\nabout 2 weeks whereas SDS gels containing [3H]palmitic acid-labeled\nproteins were exposed for up to 6 weeks.\nConfocal microscopy\nCHO cells expressing HASPB-GFP fusion proteins were grown on\nglass cover slips for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 1 \u00b5g\/ml\ndoxicyclin. The cells were then processed including\nparaformaldehyde fixation (3% w\/v) for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The\nspecimens were mounted in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology\nAssociates) and GFP-derived fluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss\nLSM 510 confocal microscope.\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting\nCHO cells expressing HASPB-GFP fusion proteins were grown under\nthe conditions indicated in the corresponding figure legends. In order\nto detach the cells from the culture plates without using protease-\nbased protocols, cell dissociation buffer (Life Technologies) was used\nto generate a cell suspension devoid of cell aggregates. Where\nindicated, cells were treated with affinity-purified anti-GFP antibodies\nfor 1 hour at 4\u00b0C on a rotating wheel. Wash procedures were carried\nout by sedimenting the cells at 200 g for 3 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Primary\nantibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies\ncoupled to allophycocyanin (APC; Molecular Probes). Prior to FACS\nanalysis, propidium iodide (1 \u00b5g\/ml) was added in order to detect\ndamaged cells. GFP- and APC-derived fluorescence was analyzed\nusing a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer.\nAutofluorescence was determined by measuring non-induced cells\nthat were treated with primary and APC-coupled secondary\nantibodies. FACS-mediated isolation of cell populations and clones\nwas performed using a Becton Dickinson FACSVantage cell sorter.\nBiochemical analysis of cell surface-associated HASPB-GFP\nfusion proteins\nCHO cells expressing HASPB-GFP fusion proteins were grown under\nthe conditions indicated in the corresponding figure legends.\nFollowing removal of the medium, the cells were washed twice with\nPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (2 mM each). A membrane-\nimpermeable biotinylation reagent (EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin;\nPierce) dissolved in 10 mM triethanolamine, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM\nCaCl2 (pH 9) was added at a final concentration of 1 mg\/ml. Following\nincubation for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C quenching of excess amounts of\nbiotinylation reagent was achieved by adding 100 mM PBS\/glycine.\nThe cells were then washed twice with PBS containing 2 mM Ca2+\nand Mg2+. Cell lysates were prepared by adding PBS containing NP-\n40. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and biotinylated and\nnon-biotinylated proteins were separated by streptavidin affinity\nchromatography. The two fractions were probed for the presence of\nHASPB-GFP fusion proteins using SDS-PAGE and western blotting\nwith affinity-purified anti-GFP antibodies.\nRetroviral insertion mutagenesis and FACS-based isolation of\nHASPB export mutants\nTo randomly mutate CHO cells, we prepared retroviral particles\nencoding the cell surface protein CD4 (pBI-CD4) (Liu et al., 2000)\nusing the Viraport system (Stratagene). CHO cells expressing\nHASPB-N18-GFP were transduced according to standard procedures.\nFollowing 3 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C CD4-positive cells were\nselected by FACS sorting. In order to isolate HASPB export mutants\nCD4-positive cells were subjected to multiple rounds of FACS sorting,\nselecting for cells with high GFP fluorescence and low cell surface\nstaining. In the third round of FACS sorting, individual cells were\ncollected and further propagated in 96-well plates at 37\u00b0C. The\ncorresponding clonal cell lines were then characterized as described.\nResults\nGeneration of model cell lines to study HASPB export\nfrom mammalian cells\nIn order to study the export mechanism of HASPB on a\nquantitative basis in mammalian cells, we generated CHO cells\nthat express various kinds of HASPB-GFP fusion proteins in\na doxicycline-dependent manner. CHOMCAT-TAM2 cells (Engling\net al., 2002) were transduced with retroviruses carrying\nHASPB-N18-GFP, HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206palm (C5S), HASPB-\nN18-GFP-\u2206myr\/palm (G2A) or GFP, respectively. Clonal cell\nlines were obtained by several rounds of FACS sorting in the\nabsence and presence of doxicycline, respectively, followed by\nthe selection of single cells characterized by GFP-derived\nfluorescence only after the addition of doxicycline. As shown\nin Fig. 1A, expression of the various reporter molecules could\nonly be detected following incubation of the cells with\ndoxicycline as analyzed by western blotting employing anti-\nGFP antibodies.\nCharacterization of HASPB fusion protein-expressing\nmodel cell lines\nWe then tested the overall membrane association of the various\nHASPB fusion proteins by subcellular fractionation into a\nsoluble pool (referred to as \u2018cytosol\u2019; Fig. 1B, lane 1) and\na membrane fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Additionally, the\nmembrane fraction was subjected to carbonate extraction\n(Fujiki et al., 1982) to discriminate loosely attached material\n(Fig. 1B, lane 3) from protein tightly associated with\nmembranes (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Typically roughly equal amounts\nof HASPB-N18-GFP were found in the cytosolic and the\nJo\nur\nna\nl o\nf C\nel\nl S\nci\nen\nce\n520\nmembrane fractions. About two thirds of the membrane-bound\nmaterial was found to be resistant to carbonate treatment. In\nthe case of HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206palm (C5S), as expected, the\npopulation found in the cytosolic fraction was significantly\nlarger than that present in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1B).\nAbout 50% of membrane-associated HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206palm\nwas found to be resistant to carbonate treatment. The vast\nmajority of HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206myr\/palm (G2A), a mutant\nthat lacks both myristoylation and palmitoylation, was found\nin the cytosolic fraction which is also the case for GFP lacking\nthe HASPB-N18 sequence (Fig. 1B). Thus, subcellular\nfractionation combined with carbonate extraction allows\nanalysis of the acylation status of HASPB fusion proteins.\nWe next analyzed the subcellular distribution of the\nHASPB-GFP fusion proteins employing confocal microscopy\n(Fig. 2). HASPB-N18-GFP was found to localize mainly to\nthe plasma membrane as well as to droplet-like structures that\nwere typically located in close proximity to the plasma\nmembrane (Fig. 2A). By contrast, HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206palm\nwas not at all associated with the plasma membrane but was\nrather localized on intracellular membranes in a perinuclear\nposition (Fig. 2B). As expected, HASPB-N18-GFP-\n\u2206myr\/palm was found exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C)\nwith a staining pattern indistinguishable from that of GFP\n(Fig. 2D). Thus, membrane association of HASPB-GFP is\ncompletely dependent on dual acylation of the HASPB N-\nterminus. These results are consistent with previous studies\nanalyzing similar constructs in Leishmania parasites (Denny\net al., 2000).\nFunctional analysis of HASPB export from CHO cells\nbased on quantitative flow cytometry\nBased on previous observations (Denny et al., 2000), an export\nassay was developed that simultaneously measures both the\nexpression level of a given HASPB-GFP fusion protein and its\nexport to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane on a\nquantitative basis. Following membrane translocation,\nHASPB-GFP fusion proteins remain membrane-anchored\nthrough their acylated N-termini, allowing decoration of the\nextracellular population with anti-GFP antibodies. This\nsubpopulation is then specifically detected using APC-\nconjugated secondary antibodies. Using flow cytometry, GFP-\nJournal of Cell Science 118 (3)\nFig. 1.

Cells were\ndetached and collected by centrifugation followed by lysis in SDS\nsample buffer. 1% of each lysate corresponding to cells from one\nwell were subjected to SDS-PAGE.

Following western blotting, HASPB-GFP fusion\nproteins were detected with affinity-purified anti-GFP antibodies.\nFig. 2.

All three HASPB-GFP fusion proteins as well\nas GFP lacking an N-terminal HASPB tag are expressed at\nsimilar levels provided that the cells have been treated with\ndoxicycline (Fig. 3A). Only the expression of HASPB-N18-\nGFP gives rise to surface staining whereas HASPB-N18-GFP-\n\u2206palm, HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206palm\/myr and GFP are negative\nwith regard to cell surface staining (Fig. 3B). Again, these data\nare consistent with previous observations made in parasites\n(Denny et al., 2000) in that export to the extracellular leaflet\nof the plasma membrane of mammalian cells is critically\ndependent on dual acylation of the SH4 N-terminus of HASPB.\nThus, the in vivo assay introduced in Fig. 3 allows precise\nquantification of HASPB export under normalized conditions\nwith respect to the expression level of a given HASPB-GFP\nfusion protein.\nBiochemical analysis of HASPB-N18-GFP export to the\nouter leaflet of the plasma membrane of CHO cells\nIn order to demonstrate an external population of HASPB-\nN18-GFP associated with the outer leaflet of the plasma\nmembrane using an independent method, biotinylation\nexperiments were carried out employing a membrane-\nimpermeable biotinylation reagent. Cells were incubated in\nthe presence of doxicycline, serum-containing medium was\nremoved followed by treatment with a biotinylation reagent.\nAfter quenching and removing excess amounts of the\nbiotinylation reagent, cells were converted into a detergent\nlysate that was then subjected to streptavidin affinity\nchromatography to separate biotinylated (cell surface) from\nnon-biotinylated (intracellular) proteins. HASPB-N18-GFP\ncan be detected in the fraction eluted from streptavidin beads\n(Fig. 4, lane 3) whereas the various controls (HASPB-N18-\nGFP-\u2206palm, HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206myr\/palm and GFP) are\nabsent from this fraction. These results demonstrate that the\nbiotinylation reagent does not traverse the plasma membrane\nand, therefore, the positive signal for HASPB-N18-GFP in the\nfraction of biotinylated proteins represents a population\nlocated on the surface of these cells. Under steady-state\nconditions, the amount of HASPB-N18-GFP on the surface of\nCHO cells was calculated by densitometry to vary between\nexperiments within a range of ~3-6% of the overall population\n(data not shown).\nScreening for somatic CHO mutants characterized by a\ndefect in HASPB export\nThe principal aim of this study was to identify the subcellular\n10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4\n0\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\nGFP fluorescence\nA\n10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4\n0\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\nanti-GFP cell surface staining (APC)\nB\n- dox\n+ dox\n- dox\n+ dox\nHASPB-N18-GFP\nHASPB-N18-GFP\n\u2206palm\n- dox\n+ dox\n- dox\n+ dox\nHASPB-N18-GFP\n\u2206myr\/palm\nGFP\nFig. 3.

To\naddress this point, we generated clonal CHO mutants by\nretroviral insertion mutagenesis, which are characterized by a\nnegative HASPB export phenotype. In order to make sure that\nsuch mutants can be identified in the presence of wild-type\ncells, we first conducted experiments designed to detect\nintercellular spreading of HASPB-N18-GFP following\ntranslocation onto the cell surface. For this purpose, HASPB-\nN18-GFP-expressing and HASPB-N18-GFP-non-expressing\ncells (CHOMCAT-TAM2) were mixed in culture, treated with\ndoxicycline and subjected to a FACS analysis measuring GFP\nand APC-derived cell surface fluorescence. Two populations of\ncells from a mixed culture of CHOMCAT-TAM2 cells (Fig. 5A,\ngreen curve) (negative for GFP fluorescence, data not shown)\nand HASPB-N18-GFP-expressing cells (blue curve) (positive\nfor GFP fluorescence, data not shown) can be easily\ndistinguished by anti-GFP cell surface staining, demonstrating\nthat HASPB-N18-GFP-exporting cells retain the secreted\nmaterial on their surface. However, cell surface staining of\nHASPB-N18-GFP-non-expressing cells is in fact significantly\nhigher than the autofluorescence background defined by\nantibody-treated CHOMCAT-TAM2 cells (Fig. 5A, red curve),\nsuggesting that a certain amount of HASPB-N18-GFP was\ntransferred from HASPB-N18-GFP-expressing cells to non-\nexpressing cells. This observation emphasizes the conclusions\ndrawn from the experiments shown in Figs 3 and 4, in that an\nextracellular population of HASPB-N18-GFP can be defined\nby its appearance on the surface of cells that are incapable of\nexpressing the reporter molecule when mixed with HASPB-\nN18-GFP-expressing cells. With regard to the mutagenesis\nstrategy, however, these experiments demonstrate that HASPB\nexport mutants are distinguishable from wild-type cells on the\nbasis of FACS sorting and can therefore be identified and\nisolated by this method, even in the presence of a large excess\nof wild-type cells.\nTo randomly generate somatic CHO mutants, we chose\nretroviral insertion mutagenesis. CHO cells carrying the\nHASPB-N18-GFP reporter gene were transduced with\nretroviral particles encoding the open reading frame of the\nintegral plasma membrane protein CD4 (Fig. 5B) (Liu et al.,\n2000). In this context, CD4 was used as a marker for mutated\ncells that were subsequently enriched by FACS. The pool of\nCD4-positive mutated cells (Fig. 5B, blue curve) was then\nsubjected to a selection of CHO mutants expressing the\nHASPB-N18-GFP reporter molecule at a normal level (as\ncompared to wild-type cells) but without localisation to the cell\nsurface. For this purpose, cells were viewed in the FACS set-\nup in dot blot mode and a sorting window was defined to select\nfor the phenotype described (Fig. 5C). Cells isolated from this\nwindow in the first round of sorting (about 0.5% of the total\npopulation) were propagated and subjected to a second round\nof cell sorting in which 3.7% of the selected population\ndisplayed the desired phenotype.

HASPB-N18-GFP expression\nwas induced by 1 \u00b5g\/ml doxicycline for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C.

CHOMCAT-TAM2 cells and\nCHOMCAT-TAM2 cells expressing HASPB-N18-GFP were gated based\non GFP fluorescence and APC-derived fluorescence of\nCHOMCAT-TAM2 cells (green curve) and CHOMCAT-TAM2 cells\nexpressing HASPB-N18-GFP (blue curve) was measured as depicted\nin the histogram.

In order\nto make sure that the reporter molecule\nitself does not contain a mutation in the\nCHO K3 mutant cell line, we isolated\ngenomic DNA and amplified the HASPB-\nN18-GFP open reading frame. As\ndemonstrated by sequencing of the\ncorresponding PCR product, the sequence\nof the N-terminal SH4 domain of the\nreporter molecule was confirmed to be\nunchanged compared to the parental CHO\nwild-type cells (data not shown).\nBased on GFP-derived fluorescence, the\nexpression level of HASPB-N18-GFP\ndoes not significantly differ between wild-\ntype and K3 cells as analyzed by FACS\n(Fig. 6A). However, HASPB-N18-GFP\ncell surface staining is largely reduced to\nabout 30% as compared to wild-type levels\n(Fig. 6A). These data were confirmed by a\nbiochemical assessment of the\nextracellular population of HASPB-N18-\nGFP in the wild type compared to K3\nmutant cells using the biotinylation assay\ndescribed in Fig. 4. The amount of\nbiotinylated cell surface HASPB-N18-\nGFP (Fig. 6B, upper panel; lane 3) derived from K3 cells is\nreduced to about 20% when compared to CHO wild-type cells\n(lower panel; lane 3).\nAs dual acylation of HASPB-N18-GFP is a critical\ndeterminant for plasma membrane targeting and export, it was\nimportant to analyze whether the reporter molecule HASPB-\nN18-GFP itself is properly modified in CHO K3 cells.\nTherefore, in a first set of experiments, overall membrane\nassociation of HASPB-N18-GFP was tested in CHO K3 cells\nby a carbonate extraction analysis. The input material of\nHASPB-N18-GFP was comparable in wild-type CHO and K3\ncells, which is consistent with the FACS experiments shown in\nFig. 6, demonstrating that the expression level of HASPB-N18-\nGFP does not differ significantly in the two cell lines (Fig. 7A).\nSimilarly, there are no apparent differences in the distribution\nof HASPB-N18-GFP between cytosol and membranes when\nCHO wild-type and K3 cells are compared (Fig. 7B, lanes 1\nand 2). Finally, when the membrane fractions of wild-type and\nK3 cells were subjected to carbonate extraction, the\ndistribution of HASPB-N18-GFP between the membrane-\nassociated and the soluble pool was identical between the two\ncell types (Fig. 7B, lanes 3 and 4). These data suggest that the\nacylation status of HASPB-N18-GFP does not differ between\nCHO wild-type and K3 cells. This conclusion was confirmed\nby metabolic labeling of HASPB-N18-GFP in wild-type and\nK3 cells using [3H]-labeled myristate and [3H]-labeled\npalmitate. Incorporation of both fatty acids into HASPB-N18-\nGFP can be detected in both wild-type and K3 cells whereas\nthe corresponding negative controls are either labeled only with\n[3H]myristate (in the case of HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206palm) or not\nlabeled at all (for HASPB-N18-GFP-\u2206myr\/palm and GFP)\n(Fig. 7C). These experiments demonstrate that HASPB-N18-\nGFP processing in terms of acylation occurs normally in the\nCHO K3 mutant cell line and, therefore, the lack of HASPB-\nN18-GFP present on the cell surface of these cells must be due\nto the translocation machinery itself from which at least one\ncomponent is apparently disrupted in K3 cells.\nHASPB-N18-GFP localizes to the plasma membrane in\nCHO K3 cells\nIn order to define the subcellular site of HASPB-N18-GFP\nmembrane translocation, we analyzed its localization in CHO\nwild-type cells versus CHO K3 cells using confocal\nmicroscopy and subcellular fractionation. There was virtually\nno difference in the subcellular distribution of HASPB-N18-\nGFP in the two cell types and in both cases the majority of the\nmaterial is localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 8A,B).\nFig. 6. Characterization of HASPB-N18-GFP export from CHO wild-type cells compared\nto CHO K3 mutant cells. (A) FACS analysis. CHO wild-type cells and CHO K3 cells were\ngrown for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C in the presence of doxicycline (1 \u00b5g\/ml). Cells were processed\nfor FACS sorting using affinity-purified anti-GFP antibodies and APC-coupled secondary\nantibodies to detect exported HASPB-N18-GFP by cell surface staining. For a statistical\nanalysis of four independent experiments, GFP-derived fluorescence and APC-derived cell\nsurface staining of CHO wild-type cells expressing HASPB-N18-GFP was set to 100%,\nrespectively. (B) Biochemical analysis of exported HASPB-N18-GFP in CHO wild-type\ncells, CHO K3 cells and various control cell lines introduced in Figs 1-4 using cell surface\nbiotinylation. The experiment was conducted exactly as described in the Materials and\nMethods and in the legend to Fig. 4.

A\nprotocol to purify plasma membrane vesicles (Sch\u00e4fer et al.,\n2004) was used to compare the enrichment of the HASPB-\nN18-GFP reporter molecule in plasma membranes of CHO\nwild-type cells (Fig. 8C, lanes 1-4) and CHO K3 cells\n(Fig. 8C, lanes 5-8), respectively. When compared to the\nhomogenate (lanes 1), HASPB-N18-GFP (lane 5) was found\nto be enriched in gradient-purified plasma membrane vesicles\nusing the plasma membrane marker transferrin receptor (TfR)\n(Futter et al., 1998) in both CHO wild-type and CHO K3 cells\n(lanes 4 and 8, respectively). Using the Golgi marker GM130\n(Nakamura et al., 1995), the plasma membrane vesicle fraction\nwas depleted of Golgi membranes demonstrating the\nsignificance of the findings described above. The association\nof HASPB-N18-GFP with plasma membranes in both CHO\nwild-type cells and K3 cells is considered to be quite striking\nas it demonstrates a defect in CHO K3 cells directly in the\ntranslocation machinery rather than some kind of intracellular\nsegregation of HASPB-N18-GFP that prevents access to the\nsite of membrane translocation. Thus, the HASPB-N18-GFP\ntranslocation apparatus is a plasma membrane-resident\nmachinery.\nA FGF-2-GFP reporter molecule is exported from CHO\nwild-type and K3 mutant cells at similar levels\nIn order to analyze whether the disrupted export component in\nCHO K3 cells is a specific factor for HASPB export or rather\na general component for non-classical secretory processes,\nwe tested whether FGF-2, as a classical example for\nunconventional secretory proteins (Nickel, 2003), is exported\nfrom CHO K3 cells. For this purpose, we transduced both CHO\nK3 and the parental CHO wild-type cells expressing the\nHASPB-N18-GFP fusion protein with retroviral particles\nencoding a FGF-2-GFP fusion protein (Engling et al., 2002;\nBackhaus et al., 2004). Owing to the different molecular\nweights (25 and 45 kDa, respectively), the two reporter\nmolecules could be easily distinguished in the cell surface\nbiotinylation assay (Figs 4 and 6). There was no difference in\nFGF-2 cell surface expression between CHO wild-type and\nCHO K3 cells (Fig. 9, compare lanes 3 and 6; upper panels),\nrespectively. By contrast, HASPB-N18-GFP analyzed from the\nsame cell preparations is exported only from CHO wild-type\ncells (compare lanes 3 and 6; lower panels). These results\ndemonstrate that the component disrupted in CHO K3 cells is\na specific machinery molecule of the HASPB export pathway.\nDiscussion\nThe specific aim of this study was to develop an experimental\napproach designed to identify the subcellular membrane\nJournal of Cell Science 118 (3)\nFig. 7.

From this point on, it is not clear whether fully\nacylated HASPB translocates across the membrane of the\nGolgi or whether it is first transported to the plasma membrane\nassociated with the cytoplasmic leaflet of secretory vesicles.\nEven though overall cell surface expression of HASPB has\nbeen shown not to be affected by brefeldin A (Denny et al.,\n2000), this result does not unequivocally rule out the possibility\nthat HASPB is traveling to the plasma membrane associated\nwith the cytoplasmic leaflet of TGN-derived secretory vesicles.\nIt is also possible that transfer to the plasma membrane\ninvolves an intermediate step in which HASPB is not at all\nassociated with intracellular membranes or HASPB might be\ntransported from the TGN to the endosomal system from where\nit might get access to the plasma membrane.\nBased on the uncertainties discussed above, we were\ninterested in establishing an experimental system that allows\nfor a quantitative analysis of HASPB cell surface expression\nunder conditions where defined steps in HASPB biogenesis are\nblocked. In particular, we were looking for experimental\nconditions where dual acylation of the N-terminal SH4 domain\nof HASPB occurs normally but HASPB export to the outer\nleaflet of the plasma membrane is blocked. In this context, we\ndecided to use CHO cells as a model system as they are well\nsuited to the generation of random somatic mutants. To\nFig. 8. Subcellular localization of HASPB-N18-GFP in CHO wild-\ntype and CHO K3 mutant cells as determined by confocal\nmicroscopy and subcellular fractionation. (A) HASPB-N18-GFP\nexpressed in CHO wild-type cells. (B) HASPB-N18-GFP expressed\nin CHO K3 mutant cells. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in the\npresence of 1 \u00b5g\/ml doxicycline for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C and processed\nfor confocal microscopy. GFP-derived fluorescence was viewed with\na Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. (C) Subcellular fractionation\nof CHO wild-type cells and CHO K3 cells was conducted as\ndescribed earlier (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2004). To identify plasma\nmembranes, antibodies directed against the transferrin receptor were\nused (Futter et al., 1998). To detect Golgi membranes, antibodies\ndirected against GM130 were used (Nakamura et al., 1995). Four\nfractions were generated and analyzed for each cell line: a hypotonic\nlysate (lanes 1 and 5), a post-mitochondrial supernatant (lanes 2 and\n6), a microsomal membrane fraction (lanes 3 and 7) and gradient-\npurified plasma membranes (lanes 4 and 8). For each fraction 15 \u00b5g\ntotal protein were loaded per lane followed by SDS-PAGE and\nwestern blotting using the antibodies indicated.\nFig. 9. Secretion of FGF-2 from CHO K3 cells occurs as efficiently\nas from parental CHO wild-type cells. Parental CHO wild-type\n(lanes 1-3) and CHO K3 mutant cells (lanes 4-6) expressing HASPB-\nN18-GFP were transduced with retroviral particles containing the\nFGF-2-GFP open reading frame controlled by a doxicycline-\ndependent element. Transduction efficiency was about 65% as\ndetermined by GFP-derived fluorescence. Both cell types were\ntreated with a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent. Cell\nlysates were generated and biotin-labeled and biotin-unlabeled\nproteins were separated by streptavidin affinity chromatography.\nInput material (lane 1 and 4; 4%), streptavidin supernatant (non-\nbiotinylated proteins, lanes 2 and 5; 4%) and streptavidin-bound\nproteins (biotinylated proteins, lanes 3 and 6; 50%) were separated\non SDS gels followed by western blotting using affinity-purified anti-\nGFP antibodies.\nJo\nur\nna\nl o\nf C\nel\nl S\nci\nen\nce\n526\nefficiently mutate CHO cells expressing HASPB-N18-GFP in\na doxicycline-dependent manner, we used retroviral insertion\nmutagenesis with CD4 as a cell surface marker to efficiently\nenrich mutated cells by FACS. Using the FACS-based\nexperimental system described, we succeeded in isolating\nclonal CHO mutants with the desired phenotype, one of which\nhas been characterized in detail in the current study.\nIn the described CHO mutant strain (K3), HASPB-N18-GFP\nis expressed in a doxicycline-dependent manner at a level\ncomparable to that of wild-type cells. In the context of this\nwork, it was most critical to isolate CHO mutants that do not\nhave any defect in the co- and\/or post-translational processing\nof HASPB, i.e. we were looking for mutants that are still\ncapable of adding both myristate and palmitate to the SH4\ndomain of HASPB. In the case of CHO K3 cells, this was\nshown to be the case by carbonate extraction experiments to\nprobe overall membrane association of HASPB-N18-GFP as\nwell as metabolic labeling experiments to demonstrate directly\nthe incorporation of [3H]-labeled myristate and palmitate into\nHASPB-N18-GFP when expressed in CHO K3 cells. These\nexperiments unequivocally demonstrated that HASPB-N18-\nGFP is processed normally in CHO K3 mutant cells resulting\nin a membrane association that is indistinguishable from\nHASPB-N18-GFP expressed in CHO wild-type cells.\nThe negative HASPB-N18-GFP export phenotype by which\nthe clonal CHO K3 cell line was isolated could be confirmed\nby both FACS-based cell surface staining experiments and a\nbiochemical assessment of HASPB-N18-GFP export using a\nmembrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent. Both methods\nconsistently demonstrated that HASPB-N18-GFP cell surface\nexpression in CHO K3 cells is greatly reduced to ~10-30% of\nthe population found on the cell surface of CHO wild-type\ncells. As the expression level of HASPB-N18-GFP does not\ndiffer significantly between CHO K3 and wild-type cells, as\nshown by both western blotting and GFP-derived fluorescence\ndetermined by FACS, we conclude that the process of HASPB-\nN18-GFP membrane translocation is perturbed in the mutant\ncell line. Based on this observation, it was then crucial to\nanalyze whether the steady-state distribution of the reporter\nmolecule is changed in CHO K3 cells as compared to wild-\ntype cells. As demonstrated by confocal microscopy and\nsubcellular fractionation, this is not the case as the majority of\nthe HASPB-N18-GFP population localizes in both cell lines to\nthe plasma membrane. Intriguingly, a FGF-2-GFP fusion\nprotein is secreted equally well from the CHO K3 mutant cell\nline and the parental CHO wild-type cells, demonstrating that\nthe disrupted factor in K3 cells is a specific component of the\nHASPB export pathway.\nFrom the combined data presented in this study, we conclude\nthat the CHO mutant cell line K3 has a direct defect in the\nmolecular machinery promoting membrane translocation of\nHASPB. The subcellular distribution of the reporter molecule\nis unchanged when wild-type and K3 mutants cells are\ncompared, with HASPB-N18-GFP detected in both cases as a\nplasma membrane-resident protein. As cell surface exposure of\nthe reporter is largely reduced in the mutant cell line, we\nconclude that the plasma membrane is the subcellular site of\nmembrane translocation of HASPB-N18-GFP. Thus, along\nwith the angiogenic growth factors FGF-1 and FGF-2\n(Prudovsky et al., 2002; Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2004), HASPB\nrepresents another example of an unconventional secretory\nprotein that is translocated directly across the plasma\nmembrane of mammalian cells in order to be exposed to the\nextracellular space. Our data allow us to describe a two-step\nprocess for the overall biogenesis of HASPB that is defined by\nacylation-dependent targeting to the inner leaflet of the plasma\nmembrane followed by translocation across the plasma\nmembrane, resulting in a membrane-anchored lipoprotein on\nthe surface of both parasites and mammalian cells.\nThe experimental approach presented in this study shows\ngreat promise for addressing a number of questions related to\nHASPB biogenesis in the future. In this regard, our goals are not\nrestricted to the molecular analysis of the HASPB membrane\ntranslocation apparatus itself but also concern the preceding\nsteps such as the molecular identity and the exact subcellular\nlocalization of the HASPB palmitoylacyltransferase. Moreover,\nit remains a completely open question how HASPB is\ntransferred from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. As the\nexperimental approach described gave rise to a whole collection\nof CHO mutant cell lines characterized by a negative HASPB\nexport phenotype, we hope to also identify mutants that are\ndefective in early steps of HASPB biogenesis. The most\nimportant future goal will be to look for the defective genes by\nfunctional expression cloning and\/or genome insertion analysis\nof the retrovirus used as a mutagen as well as to assign the\ncorresponding gene products to defined steps of the HASPB\nbiogenesis pathway on a functional basis.\nWe thank Britta Br\u00fcgger (Heidelberg University Biochemistry\nCenter) for critical comments on the manuscript.
