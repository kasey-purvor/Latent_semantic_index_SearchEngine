Along each 2-D profile a velocity\u2013depth function has been digitised at 5 km intervals. These 1-D velocity functions were mapped into three dimensions using ordinary kriging with weights determined to minimise the difference between digitised and interpolated values. An analysis of variograms of the digitised data suggested a radial isotropic weighting scheme was most appropriate. Horizontal dimensions of the model cells are optimised at 40 \u00d7 40 km and the vertical dimension at 1 km.

The construction of\nthe model through kriging allows the uncertainty in the velocity structure to be assessed. This\nuncertainty indicates the high density of data required to confidently interpolate the crustal\nvelocity structure, and shows that for this region the velocity is poorly constrained for large\nareas away from the input data.\nKey words: continental crust, Europe, Moho discontinuity, P waves, seismic velocities,\nseismic structure.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nModels of the seismic velocity structure of the continental crust\nplay an important role in seismology as the starting point for a va-\nriety of types of study. They can be used for improved location of\nearthquakes, thus assisting in defining and mitigating seismic haz-\nards. Global models of crustal velocity structure (e.g. Bassin et al.\n2000) may be used in the application of traveltime corrections to\nteleseismic arrivals, facilitating investigation of the interior of the\nearth. In conjunction with earthquake data, models may be used as\nthe starting point for crustal tomography, which in turn adds new\ninformation to the model, refining it and improving its resolution. In\naddition to applications in seismology, crustal models define varia-\ntions in physical properties, which have applications in modelling of\ntectonic processes and the evolution of the continental lithosphere.\nDeep seismic refraction profiles have been acquired around the\nworld since the 1950s, providing snapshots of the crustal structure\nbeneath the survey areas. As the quantity of data has grown nu-\nmerous authors have brought together the individual surveys into\nglobal or regional compilations and used the data to map out the\nthickness and structure of the crust [at least 38 compilations of\ncrustal structure data were published before 1998 (Mooney et al.\n2002)]. With ever increasing quantity and quality of individual sur-\n\u2217Now at: The US Geological Survey, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA.\nE-mail: rwe5@le.ac.uk\nveys, there has been a continual improvement in the detail of these\nmodels. However, the global coverage of seismic data is still quite\nsparse and data are very irregularly distributed, limiting the global\nmodels to relatively coarse grid dimensions [e.g. 2\u25e6 for CRUST2.0\n(Bassin et al. 2000)]. Regional studies in densely surveyed areas\nallow significant refinement of the models and thus much greater\ndetail may be included. As a result of extensive scientific research\nin conjunction with hydrocarbon exploration, NW Europe is unique\nin having substantial coverage by deep seismic refraction profiles\nover such an extensive area. In this contribution the available data\nin NW Europe have been compiled and digitized, building on an\nearlier compilation (Clegg & England 2003) for the region.\nAs well as controlled source profiling, a number of natural\nsource techniques provide information on the thickness and struc-\nture of the crust, such as delay time analysis, receiver functions\nand tomography. However, controlled source wide-angle reflec-\ntion\/refraction seismic profiling (hereafter referred to as wide-angle\nseismic data) offers a number of distinct advantages as a starting\npoint for building models of the crustal velocity structure. Pri-\nmarily, through modelling, wide-angle seismic data recovers true,\nor interval, velocity and depth to major interfaces within deter-\nminable uncertainties. Little or no a priori information is required. In\ncontrast, normal-incidence reflection, tomographic, delay time and\nreceiver function methods suffer from the coupled uncertainty be-\ntween velocity and depth to interfaces, unless a priori constraints\nare available. Most wide-angle seismic reflection experiments are\nconducted with particular targets in mind and hence receiver and\n1172 C\u00a9 2007 The Authors\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\nSeismic velocity model for the UK and Ireland 1173\nsource locations are usually planned for optimum coverage of the\nsubsurface. In contrast, passive experiments are restricted by the\nrange of backazimuths of those events occurring during the record-\ning period. However, passive techniques may give a better indi-\ncation of the range of anisotropy present while most refraction\nexperiments have, to date, been 2-D and hence their spatial or\nazimuthal coverage is restricted. This contribution describes the\nconstruction of a 3-D model of crustal P-wave velocity struc-\nture for the UK, Ireland and surrounding seas, based on inter-\npolation of 2-D wide-angle seismic profiles by ordinary kriging.\nThe complete velocity model can be obtained as an ascii file from\nhttp:\/\/www.le.ac.uk\/gl\/rwe5\/velocity structure of the uk.html\n2 T H E DATA B A S E\nThe model is built from a database that provides the input for three\nsurfaces (topography\/bathymetry, top basement and Moho) and two\nlayers (sediments and crystalline basement). At the core of the model\nis a database of digitized wide-angle seismic profiles that provide\nthe input data for the velocity of the crystalline basement layer and\nthe Moho depth. The locations of the profiles included in the\ndatabase are shown in Fig. 1 and a complete listing of the pro-\nfiles and the primary source of the data is listed in the Appendix.\nEach profile was sampled at 5 km intervals to provide a suite\nof 1-D velocity\u2013depth functions and Moho depth information.\nVelocity values were initially recorded at the exact depth of nodes\nor boundaries in the published model; then, after checking for\nerrors, were resampled to 100 m depth intervals using linear\ninterpolation.\nUncertainties in the velocities and Moho depths have been as-\nsigned to the wide-angle seismic data and have been included in the\ndatabase. Where available, published uncertainties have been used,\nbut it is rare for a comprehensive review of uncertainties to be in-\ncluded in most published work. Consequently, experience with mod-\nelling wide-angle seismic data and estimates based on comparable\npublished work have been used as a guide in making qualitative un-\ncertainty estimates. Experiments were considered comparable when\nthey used similar source and receiver coverage and modelling meth-\nods. These two factors were the primary considerations in assess-\ning uncertainties. Models constructed using ray tracing methods or\nmethods in which the velocity structure is determined by traveltime\ntomography with the Moho included as a floating reflector (e.g.\nFAST, Zelt and Barton 1998) were considered \u2018good\u2019. Modelling\nusing time term methods, T2\u2013X 2 and other miscellaneous methods\nwere considered \u2018poor\u2019. Simple fitting of constant velocity layers\non the basis of gradient and intercept time of arrivals on record\nsections was considered \u2018very poor\u2019. This qualitative assessment\nincluded whether the modelling was 1-D or 2-D, with 1-D models\nbeing considered significantly poorer than 2-D models.

Kelly, R.W. England and P.K.H. Maguire\nsuperior, although less emphasis was placed on this than the gen-\neral modelling method. The density of data coverage (i.e. spacing\nof receivers and shots) and whether the survey had reversed cover-\nage were considered almost as important to the velocity uncertainty\nas the modelling method. The data coverage was generally assessed\nthrough published ray path diagrams. Inspection of ray path coverage\nwas considered particularly significant when assessing uncertainty\nin Moho depth as is it rare for a survey to have PmP reflections\nalong the full length of the profile. Large sections of the Moho are\noften unsampled in even the best-designed experiments with good\ndata recovery (e.g. Klingelho\u00a8fer et al. 2005). Additionally, the use\nof gravity modelling was considered to improve the uncertainty in\nthe depth to the Moho, particularly in regions poorly constrained by\nPmP reflections, but to be very much secondary to the seismic mod-\nelling method and data coverage. The use of amplitude information\nwas considered to significantly reduce uncertainties in velocities\nby better defining gradients in the models. The quality of the data\nin terms of signal-to-noise ratio was also examined, although not\nconsidered as significant. Within the published wide-angle seismic\nmodels coincident normal incidence reflection surveys have been\nused in a number of ways: to construct a starting model; to con-\nstrain the sediment geometries and velocity structure; directly as\nadditional data in the modelling; and as an independent source of\ndata to assess the final model. When used in either the first or second\napproach, the normal incidence data is considered to help produce\na more accurate final model, but to have little effect on the con-\nstraint\/uncertainty of that model. In the third approach the data is\nconsidered during the assessment of data coverage. If used only to\nassess the final model the data has no effect on the constraints on\nvelocity.\nUncertainties have generally been assigned as percentages of the\nvelocity values and as absolute uncertainty, in kilometres, for the\nMoho depths. The two most common modelling methods are ray\ntracing and time-term analysis. Typical errors assigned to a ray\ntraced model with good data coverage (e.g. ocean bottom recorders\nevery 30\u201360 km and dense coverage of airgun shots) and consid-\neration of amplitude data would be \u223c3 per cent (approximately\nequivalent to \u00b10.2 km s\u22121) for the upper crust and \u00b15 per cent\n(\u223c \u00b10.35 km s\u22121) at the base of the crust. The models in which\ntime-term analysis has been used are generally older than the ray\ntraced models and so have poorer data coverage and amplitude data\nis not used. As a result such models are typically assigned errors\nof \u00b17 per cent (approximately equivalent to \u00b10.3 km s\u22121) for the\nupper crust increasing to \u00b110 per cent (\u223c \u00b10.6 km s\u22121) at the base\nof the crust. The depths to mid-crustal interfaces were not assigned\nuncertainties as this information is largely redundant. In the case\nof first order discontinuities, the uncertainty on mid-crustal inter-\nfaces is related to the velocity step across the interface. Interfaces\nassociated with large velocity discontinuities are generally well con-\nstrained. Only those interfaces associated with small velocity steps\n(or highly uncertain velocities) are poorly constrained. Therefore,\nwhere interfaces are poorly constrained the velocity step across the\ninterface is generally much smaller than the uncertainties in the ve-\nlocity values on either side. As a result the discontinuity is largely\nmasked by the velocity uncertainties and the uncertainty on its depth\nbecomes relatively irrelevant. A full list of the assigned uncertainties\nfor each model is given in the Appendix.\nAt locations where published 2-D models intersect there is of-\nten a small difference in the interpreted crustal structure, both in\nterms of the Moho depth and the velocity structure. In such cases\nthe data were recorded in the database with their original, published\nvalues. If necessary the uncertainties assigned to the data were in-\nTable 1.

In\nbuilding the velocity model, described below, any such differences\nwere accommodated by averaging the values at the intersections.\nWhere the sedimentary layer is present, a 1-D profile of increas-\ning velocity with depth was used to define the velocity structure.\nThis velocity\u2013depth function was derived using the interval ve-\nlocities calculated from stacking (rms) velocities taken from the\nreflection profiles listed in Table 1. These data were chosen to cover\neach of the major sedimentary basins in the region. The velocity\ndata were converted to a mean velocity\u2013depth profile by calculat-\ning a power regression curve through the median value of velocities\n(binned into 0.5 km depth intervals) (Fig. 2). An estimate of the\nuncertainties associated with the velocity of the sediments was ac-\nquired by fitting similar regression curves through the 5th and 95th\npercentiles of the binned data (Fig. 2). The equations that define the\nminimum, best-fitting and maximum velocity values are: 5th per-\ncentile v = 2.1648z0.2929; median v = 2.909z0.2255; 95th percentile\nv = 4.8018z0.0584; where v is velocity (km s\u22121) and z is the depth\nbelow the surface\/sea bed (km).\nThe top surface of the model is defined by the topography and\nbathymetry. The data used in the model were extracted from the\nSmith & Sandwell (1997) bathymetry and GTOPO30 topography.\nThe interface between the sediments and crystalline crust was\ncompiled from a number of data sources.

These profiles were then extrapolated using the tensioned min-\nimum curvature algorithm of Smith & Wessel (1990). For onshore\nBritain a digital version of the Variscan unconformity was provided\nby the British Geological Survey and was used to define the base\nof the sediments. These data are published in Whittaker (1985). In\nregions not covered by the data sets described above, the base of the\nsediments was taken from a 1\u25e6 resolution, global map of sediment\nthickness (Laske & Masters 1997). The only exceptions are\nScotland and Ireland where the sediment thicknesses were set to\nzero as the 1\u25e6 resolution of the global data results in artificial sedi-\nment thickness in regions of short-wavelength topographic change.\n3 C O N S T R U C T I O N O F T H E V E L O C I T Y\nM O D E L\nThe model is defined using Cartesian coordinates, with distances\nmeasured in kilometres, based on a Transverse Mercator projec-\ntion centred at 3.4\u25e6 west, 57.15\u25e6 north. The velocity structure of the\ncrystalline crust was constructed by interpolation of the digitised\nwide-angle seismic data assuming that the data were a randomly\ndistributed set of points. This assumption fails in the direction of\nthe profiles but is valid between profiles in the areas in which the\nvelocity is to be interpolated, since the majority are not arranged\nsystematically. The interpolation method was 3-D ordinary kriging\nusing the Deutsch and Journal (1998) code KT3D. The Moho sur-\nface was also built primarily through ordinary kriging using KT3D.\nHowever, the regions around the Porcupine Bank and Biscay Margin\nwere adjusted after gravity modelling, discussed below.\n3.1 Ordinary kriging\nKriging is an interpolation technique that utilizes knowledge of the\nspatial continuity of a variable to estimate its value away from data\npoints. Kriging assumes that the spatial autocorrelation of the vari-\nable (in this case velocity or Moho depth) is known in the form of the\nsemi-variogram or covariance, and uses this to weight data points\nand estimate the value of the variable away from the known sample\nlocations. This use of the statistical model to produce weights for\nthe interpolation makes kriging a superior technique compared to\ntraditional methods, such as inverse distance interpolation, which\nuse a weighting function that may not be appropriate for the data.\nThe spatial continuity of the variable is described by the vari-\nogram model. This is determined through analysis (variography) of\nexperimental variograms constructed from the sample data.\n3.2 Variography\nThe models used for the interpolation of the velocity and Moho data\nwere based on experimental semi-variograms and semi-madograms\nof the input data (Figs 3 and 4). In assessing the spatial continuity\nof a variable it is not the absolute geographical location of the data\nwhich is important, but rather the relative position of the samples.\nThis relative location is represented by the lag, the distance between\ntwo data points.

As well as\nseparation the lag can be used to specify the azimuth between sam-\nples. This allows the spatial continuity to be assessed in different\norientations, thus investigating any spatial anisotropy in the variable.\nIn addition to the semi-variogram the semi-madogram was also cal-\nculated for the data as this is a good indicator of anisotropy. This\nis because the semi-madogram differs from the semi-variogram in\nusing absolute rather than squared difference between points xi and\nyi,\n\u03b3M (h) = 1\n2N (h)\nN (h)\u2211\ni=1\n|xi \u2212 yi |.

In the Moho data there is\nzonal anisotropy, that is, a direction dependent sill (the maximum\nvalue to which the variogram tends at large lags) but constant range\n(the distance at which the difference from the sill is negligible),\nwith a minimum sill, that is, minimum variability, in a NE or NNE\ndirection (Fig. 3a). Such a trend is likely to be inherited from the\nrelatively high sampling of the continental margin between Hatton\nBank and the V\u00f8ring Margin. Along this margin the topography and\nMoho depths show a rapid change in a NW direction associated with\nthe transition from continent to ocean, but far greater continuity in\nthe NE direction, parallel to the margin (Fig. 1). It is also possible\nthat the NE\u2013NNE structural trend generated during the Caledonian\nOrogeny has some residual signature affecting the Moho data away\nfrom the continental margin. However, since a visual inspection of\nthe data suggests that the strong anisotropy is restricted to the north-\nwest European continental margin, the risk of overinterpreting and\nintroducing erroneous structure into the interpolated Moho surface\nwas considered too high to include anisotropy in the model.\nThe velocity data show unquestionable dip-dependent zonal and\ngeometric anisotropy, that is, dip-dependent sill and range, with\nthe horizontal variograms exhibiting greater ranges and lower sills\nthan the dipping variograms (cf . Figs 4a\u2013c). This is consistent with\nwhat is known of the crustal velocity structure from 2-D models. A\nvertical profile through the crust may well show increasing velocity\nfrom 5 to 7 km s\u22121 over a few tens of kilometres depth, whereas\nthe horizontal variation may well be less than 1 km s\u22121 along a\n2-D profile several hundred kilometres in length. Therefore, the\nhorizontal variation is expected to be both smaller in magnitude and\nspatially less rapidly changing than the vertical variation. There is\nno clear evidence for azimuth-dependent anisotropy. Therefore, the\nmodel variogram was constructed to reproduce the dip-dependent\nzonal and geometric anisotropy, but to be azimuthally isotropic.\n3.2.2 Sill and range\nThe experimental semi-variogram for the Moho data shows a well-\ndeveloped sill with a range of approximately 800 km (Fig. 3b). For\nthe velocity data the horizontal variograms show a well-developed\nsill, at \u223c0.5 km2 s\u22124, beyond a range of approximately 150 km.\nThe sill for the dipping variograms is not well developed, but is\nhigher than 0.5 km2 s\u22124. The best-fitting curve to the dipping vari-\nograms suggests a model with a vertical range of 35 km and sill of\n1.2 km2 s\u22124 (Figs 4a\u2013c).\n3.2.3 Near-origin behaviour\nVariables that are highly continuous over short distances, such as\ndepth or layer thickness data, usually exhibit parabolic behaviour\nnear the origin of the variogram. As adjacent points on a continuous\nsurface will be at almost identical height, the variability at short\nlags is very small. Such surfaces are often modelled with a Gaus-\nsian weighting function to reproduce this continuity. A Gaussian\nweighting function is defined using:\n\u03b3 (h) = 1 \u2212 exp\n(\u22123h2\na2\n)\n, (3)\nwhere a is the range. Using a Gaussian curve, as opposed to a linear\nfunction, gives far greater weight to the data close to the inter-\npolated cell than to data at intermediate or large distances within\nthe range. This results in a smoother interpolated surface with less\nshort-wavelength change than one produced using a linear weight-\ning function. However, there is no evidence for this behaviour in the\nMoho data, which are approximately linear near the origin (Figs 3a\nand b). Although the Moho is generally a continuous surface in\ncrustal models, several refraction profiles show changes in Moho\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 171, 1172\u20131184\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\nSeismic velocity model for the UK and Ireland 1177\ndepth over a distance of less than 50 km (the smallest separation in\nthe experimental variograms) (e.g. Aichroth et al. 1992; O\u2019Reilly\net al. 1995; Mjelde et al. 1997; McCaughey et al. 2000; Raum et al.\n2002). Such high frequency depth variation is also seen in deep,\nnormal-incidence reflection profiling (e.g. Klemperer and Hobbs\n1991; Chadwick and Pharaoh 1998). It is this variation at relatively\nshort-wavelengths that reduces any Gaussian-like behaviour in the\nvariogram. In addition, it is highly likely that at the shortest lag\nthe experimental variograms are affected by the mismatches in the\nMoho depth at profile intersections. However, the increase in con-\ntinuity between the shortest and second shortest lag indicates that\nthe influence of the mismatches is geographically very restricted.\nTherefore, a model with linear behaviour near the origin was consid-\nered more appropriate than a Gaussian model for the Moho data. For\nall the velocity variograms the short lags show near linear behaviour\n(Figs 4a\u2013c). This is consistent with the observation that the velocity\nstructure can contain discontinuities and rapid changes within the\ncrust.\n3.2.4 Structure at intermediate lags\nA transitional model (i.e. including a sill) with near linear behaviour\nnear the origin is required for both the Moho depth and crustal ve-\nlocity data (as described above). The two most common transitional\nmodels are the spherical model:\n\u03b3 (h) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n1.5\nh\na\n\u2212 0.5\n(\nh\na\n)3\nif h \u2264 a\n1 otherwise\n\u23ab\u23aa\u23aa\u23ac\n\u23aa\u23aa\u23ad\n(4)\nand the exponential model:\n\u03b3 (h) = 1 \u2212 exp\n(\u22123h\na\n)\n. (5)\nThe models are broadly similar in structure at intermediate lags,\ndiffering only in the rate of change. As the Moho experimental semi-\nvariogram (Fig. 3b) shows reasonably linear behaviour at the inter-\nmediate lags, the spherical model was preferred to the exponential\nmodel. For the velocities, the dipping variograms show reasonably\nsmooth variation at intermediate lags. However, the horizontal var-\niograms have a distinct change in gradient at a lag of approximately\n50 km. This gradient change is reproduced by adding a second hori-\nzontal structure with a short range to cause the initial rapid increase,\nbut which keeps the horizontal range at 150 km.\nThe final variogram structure chosen to model the Moho data was\na single, isotropic spherical structure with a range of 800 km and\nsill of 49 km2 (Fig. 3b). The velocity variogram model consists of\nthree structures: A spherical structure with a 50 km horizontal range,\n35 km vertical range and 0.2 km2 s\u22124 sill; a spherical structure with\na 150 km horizontal range, 35 km vertical range and 0.3 km2 s\u22124\nsill; and a further spherical structure with infinite horizontal range,\n35 km vertical range and 0.7 km2 s\u22124 sill (Fig. 4).\n3.3 Dimensions of the model elements\nTo determine the optimum spatial dimensions of the model elements\nthe Moho data were interpolated onto a range of grids. Investigation\nof the model dimension was based on the Moho data, rather than\nthe velocity data, in order to save computational time. Given the\nsimilarity between the Moho and velocity distributions (Fig. 1), and\nthat velocity data were interpolated with very little weight allocated\nto data at different depths, using 2-D data instead of 3-D data has very\nlittle impact on the evaluation of model parameters. The cell size that\nproduced the optimum balance between reproducing details in the\ndata and minimizing contouring artefacts (such as bulls-eye features\naround data points) was found to be 40 km. The vertical element\nsize was set to reflect the balance between the desire to have fine\nspacing to reproduce the vertical variation seen in the input data and\nthe need to have coarser spacing to allow for the poorer resolution of\nthe velocity structure in the lower crust (Section 2). The Moho depth\nuncertainties, which have an average of approximately \u00b12 km, give\nan indication of the depth resolution in the lower crust. However,\ngiven that the resolution in the upper crust is significantly greater and\nthat lower crustal velocity gradients are generally small, a vertical\nelement dimension of 1 km was considered the most appropriate\nfor the crustal layer as a whole. Prior to interpolation the data were\ndeclustered by calculating the mean value and location of data within\neach model cell.\nThe search parameters used in the final model required a mini-\nmum of 25 and maximum of 64 data points, with the maximum per\noctant of 8. The search radius was set to 800 km, allowing Moho\ndepths to be estimated at all constrained locations. The interpolated\nMoho depths are shown in Fig. 5a. The region encompassing the\nPorcupine Basin and Biscay margin has substantial bathymetric re-\nlief which is mirrored in the Moho structure imaged in the 2-D\nseismic profiles in the database. However, the data distribution is\nunfortunate in that only one profile fully samples the change from\nabyssal plain to continental shelf (Fig. 1). The distribution of data\nresults in interpolated Moho depths that vary over a wider region\nthan does the bathymetry and only weakly capture the structure of\nthe Porcupine Basin (Fig. 5a). The velocity and Moho structure of\nan earlier iteration of the crustal model presented here were ver-\nified by converting the velocities to density and performing 3-D\ngravity modelling (Kelly 2006). The results of this modelling indi-\ncated that Moho in this region must echo the bathymetric change\nmore closely than the interpolated data. Therefore, in producing the\ncrustal model the Moho depths along the Biscay Margin and under\nthe Porcupine Basin have been replaced by the depths derived from\nthis gravity model (Fig. 6a). The interpolated Moho depths show\nvery high uncertainties under continental Europe and Scandinavia\n(Fig. 5b); therefore, these areas were removed when defining the\nmodel boundaries (see Fig. 1 for model extent).\nAn 800 km range was also used for the velocity data, ensuring\nthat all cells within the model would be assigned a Moho depth\nand velocity. The kriged velocity data were combined with the sed-\niment velocity estimates, with the layer thicknesses defined using\nthe final Moho (Fig. 6a) and filtered versions of the topography and\nbase-sediment surfaces (Fig 6b). The interface between the sedi-\nment and crystalline layers in general falls within one of the model\ncells (rather than falling exactly at the cell boundary). Therefore, to\nreproduce the velocity structure as accurately as possible, the cell\ncontaining the base\u2013sediment interface is assigned a weighted aver-\nage of the sediment and crystalline crust velocities. The weighting\nis controlled by the fraction of the cell containing sediment and the\nfraction containing crystalline crust.\nTo obtain uncertainty in the velocity of each model cell and the\nMoho depth, the uncertainties in the database were combined with\nthe kriging uncertainties using the law of propagation of errors. Two\nassumptions were made in doing this. First, the uncertainty associ-\nated with the input data conforms to a Gaussian distribution. Second,\nthe database uncertainties are equal to twice the standard deviation\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 171, 1172\u20131184\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\n1178 A. Kelly, R.W.

Example depth slice from the final crustal velocity model. The slice is for the cells 12\u201313 km below sea level. Pale grey regions are outside the\nmodel area, dark grey elements are below the Moho and therefore do not contain velocity data. Velocity contours are drawn in black at 0.25 km s\u20131 intervals,\nfor velocities greater than 5.5 km s\u20131. Uncertainty contours are drawn in black at 0.5 km s\u20131 intervals.\nresult of the short variogram range the velocity constraint diminishes\nrapidly away from the data points, resulting in uncertainty maps that,\nonce below the sediment layers clearly mimic the data distribution.\nConsequently, for much of the model space the calculated velocities\nrepresent a poorly constrained best estimate. The uncertainty maps\nalso indicate the density of data required for this method of model\nconstruction to produce a well-constrained model for the whole\nregion.\nFor the top few kilometres, the model shows significant lateral\nvelocity variation associated with the sedimentary basins (Supple-\nmentary Fig. S1). By 6\u20137 km depth much of the model has standard\nupper-crustal velocities (\u223c6 km s\u20131), but in the deeper parts of the\nbasins substantial lateral variations are maintained to approximately\n10 km depth. At depths greater than 10 km the model represents the\nlower crust in the west and northwest, near the continental margin\n(Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. S2). As a result the velocities are\nhigher in these areas and the model shows a notable lateral velocity\ngradient. At greater depths the lower crust on the northwest side\nof the North Sea Central Graben shows higher velocities than the\nsoutheast. Elevated velocities are also seen under Ireland and par-\nticularly the Irish Sea (Supplementary Fig. S4), a region of possible\nmagmatic underplating (Al-Kindi et al. 2003; Shaw Champion et al.\n2006; Tomlinson et al. 2006).\nThe largest lateral variations in the velocity structure in the model\nare associated with the sedimentary basins (Fig. 1 and Supple-\nmentary figures). This is also shown by the mean crustal velocity\n(Fig. 8a). However, removing the sediments from the mean velocity\ncalculation (Fig. 8b) illustrates that there are also variations in the\nvelocity structure of the crystalline crust. Most notable are the higher\naverage velocities recorded in regions where magmatic underplat-\ning is postulated to have occurred, especially along the Hatton Bank\nand V\u00f8ring Margin ocean\u2013continent transitions. The median, mean\nand standard deviation of the crustal velocities are 6.14, 6.09 and\n0.34, respectively, when including the sediment, and 6.36, 6.36 and\n0.12 when using the crystalline crust only.\n5 C O M PA R I S O N S W I T H E X I S T I N G\nM O D E L S\nThe most widely used crustal velocity model is the CRUST2.0 global\n2\u25e6 model of Bassin et al. (2000). To assist the comparison between\nthe model presented here and the CRUST2.0 model, the average\nvelocity structure of the CRUST 2.0 model is shown in Fig. 8. The\nmedian, mean and standard deviation in crustal velocities of the\nCRUST2.0 model in the same region as the new model are 6.26,\n6.24 and 0.21, respectively, including sediment, or 6.56, 6.50 and\n0.11 excluding the sediment. These values are notably higher than in\nthe new model. The main areas producing these differences between\nthe two models are the sedimentary basins and shallow marine areas\naround Britain and Ireland (Fig. 8). The significant refinement in cell\nsize for the new model results in far greater detail for the marine\nsedimentary basins; for example the Rockall and Porcupine basins\nare only poorly resolved in the CRUST2.0 model, but are well de-\nfined, and have lower mean velocities, in the new model. However,\nmost of the difference comes from the shallow marine areas around\nBritain and Ireland, which are defined using a continental shelf type\nsection in the CRUST2.0 model. This type section has higher ve-\nlocities than the model presented here. As the new model is based\non seismic profiles, rather than a general type section, it is more\nconsistent with the measured velocity structure in these regions.\nThe Moho used to define the base of the model can be compared\nwith the most recent published Moho map of Western Europe by\nDe`zes & Ziegler (2001). The two maps are very similar for much\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 171, 1172\u20131184\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\n1180 A. Kelly, R.W. England and P.K.H. Maguire\nFigure 8.

One area of notable difference between the two\nmaps is the Northern North Sea, where the De`zes & Ziegler map\npredicts significant Moho relief under the Shetland Platform and\nViking Graben. This Moho structure is not seen in the model as there\nis no wide-angle seismic data across this region to image such relief.\nThe De`zes and Ziegler map is based on a Moho map of the United\nKingdom (Chadwick & Pharaoh 1998) constructed using normal\nincidence reflection profiles, which are relatively abundant in the\nregion and suggest that there is significant Moho uplift under the\nViking Graben. Therefore, this area of the model could benefit from\nfurther modelling using constraints provided by depth converted\nnear normal incidence deep seismic data.\n6 C O N C L U S I O N S\nWe believe the model presented here (which can be ob-\ntained in full from http:\/\/www.le.ac.uk\/gl\/rwe5\/velocity structure\nof the uk.html) is uniquely detailed for such a large region. The\nresolution and details of the Moho are similar to existing crustal\nthickness maps. However, unlike these earlier maps, the work\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 171, 1172\u20131184\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\nSeismic velocity model for the UK and Ireland 1181\npresented here is a true crustal model, recording lateral and verti-\ncal variations in velocity structure as well as crustal thickness. This\nmodel is unique in that it includes estimations of the uncertainties\nin the velocity structure and crustal thickness. The velocity struc-\nture of the new model is broadly similar to the existing models, but\nvelocities are slightly slower than in the CRUST2.0 model (Bassin\net al. 2000). These lower average crustal velocities reflect a more\ndetailed record of the sedimentary basins and the determination of\nvelocity based on seismic profiles, rather than general type sections.\nHowever, the model would benefit from increased data coverage.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nAK gratefully acknowledges financial support from a University\nof Leicester, Department of Geology research studentship and the\nBritish Geological Survey.
