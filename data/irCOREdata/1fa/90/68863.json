However, trigonal warping (which\nbreaks p\u2192 \u2212p symmetry of the Fermi line in each valley) suppresses antilocalisation, while inter-\nvalley scattering due to atomically sharp scatterers in a realistic graphene sheet or by edges in a\nnarrow wire tends to restore conventional negative magnetoresistance.

In recently developed graphene-based tran-\nsistors [5, 6] the electronic Fermi line consists of two\ntiny circles [7] surrounding corners K\u00b1 of the hexagonal\nBrillouin zone [8], and quasiparticles are described by 4-\ncomponent Bloch functions \u03a6 =[\u03c6K+,A, \u03c6K+,B, \u03c6K\u2212,B,\n\u03c6K\u2212,A], which characterise electronic amplitudes on two\ncrystalline sublattices (A and B), and the Hamiltonian\nH\u02c6 = v\u03a0z \u2297 \u03c3p\u2212 \u00b5[\u03c3x(p\n2\nx \u2212 p\n2\ny)\u2212 2\u03c3ypxpy]. (1)\nHere, we use direct products of Pauli matrices\n\u03c3x,y,z, \u03c30 \u2261 1\u02c6 acting in the sublattice space (A,B) and\n\u03a0x,y,z,\u03a00 \u2261 1\u02c6 acting in the valley space (K\u00b1) to high-\nlight the form of H\u02c6 in the non-equivalent valleys [8]. Near\nthe center of each valley electron dispersion is determined\nby the Dirac-type part v\u03c3p of H\u02c6 . It is isotropic and lin-\near. For the valleyK+ the electronic excitations with mo-\nmentum p have energy vp and are chiral with \u03c3p\/p = 1,\nwhile for holes the energy is \u2212vp and \u03c3p\/p = \u22121. In the\nvalley K\u2212, the chirality is inverted: it is \u03c3p\/p = \u22121 for\nelectrons and \u03c3p\/p = 1 for holes. The quadratic term in\nEq. (1) violates the isotropy of the Dirac spectrum and\ncauses a weak trigonal warping [8].\nDue to the chirality of electrons in a graphene-based\ntransistor, charges trapped in the substrate or on its sur-\nface cannot scatter carriers in exactly the backwards di-\nrection [2, 7], provided that they are remote from the\ngraphene sheet by more than the lattice constant. In\nthe theory of quantum transport [9] the suppression of\nbackscattering is associated with weak anti-localisation\n(WAL) [10]. For purely potential scattering, possible\nWAL in graphene has recently been related to the Berry\nphase pi specific to the Dirac fermions, though it has also\nbeen noticed that conventional weak localisation (WL)\nmay be restored by intervalley scattering [11, 12].\nIn this Letter we show that the WL magnetoresistance\nin graphene directly reflects the degree of valley sym-\nmetry breaking by the warping term in the free-electron\nHamiltonian (1) and by atomically sharp disorder. To\ndescribe the valley symmetry, we introduce two sets of\n4\u00d74 Hermitian matrices: \u2019isospin\u2019 ~\u03a3 = (\u03a3x,\u03a3y,\u03a3z) and\n\u2019pseudospin\u2019 ~\u039b = (\u039bx,\u039by,\u039bz). These are defined as\n\u03a3x = \u03a0z \u2297 \u03c3x, \u03a3y = \u03a0z \u2297 \u03c3y, \u03a3z = \u03a00 \u2297 \u03c3z, (2)\n\u039bx = \u03a0x \u2297 \u03c3z, \u039by = \u03a0y \u2297 \u03c3z, \u039bz = \u03a0z \u2297 \u03c30, (3)\nand form two mutually independent algebras, [~\u03a3, ~\u039b] = 0,\n[\u03a3s1 ,\u03a3s2 ] = 2i\u03b5\ns1s2s\u03a3s, [\u039bl1 ,\u039bl2 ] = 2i\u03b5\nl1l2l\u039bl,\nwhich determine two commuting subgroups of the group\nU4 of unitary transformations [13] of a 4-component \u03a6:\nan isospin (sublattice) group SU\u03a32 \u2261 {e\nia~n\u00b7~\u03a3} and a pseu-\ndospin (valley) group SU\u039b2 \u2261 {e\nib~n\u00b7~\u039b}.\nThe operators ~\u03a3 and ~\u039b help us to represent the electron\nHamiltonian in weakly disordered graphene as\nH\u02c6 = v ~\u03a3p+ h\u02c6w + I\u02c6u(r) +\n\u2211\ns,l=x,y,z\n\u03a3s\u039blus,l(r), (4)\nwhere h\u02c6w = \u2212\u00b5\u03a3x( ~\u03a3p)\u039bz\u03a3x( ~\u03a3p)\u03a3x.\nThe Dirac part of H\u02c6 in Eq.(4), v ~\u03a3p and potential dis-\norder I\u02c6u(r) [\u02c6I is a 4\u00d74 unit matrix and \u3008u (r)u (r\u2032)\u3009 =\nu2\u03b4 (r\u2212 r\u2032)] do not contain pseudospin operators \u039bl, i.e.,\nthey remain invariant under the group SU\u039b2 transfor-\nmations. Since ~\u03a3 and ~\u039b change sign under the time-\ninversion [14], the products \u03a3s\u039bl are t \u2192 \u2212t invariant\nand, together with I\u02c6 can be used as a basis to repre-\nsent non-magnetic static disorder. Below, we assume\nthat remote charges dominate the elastic scattering rate,\n\u03c4\u22121 \u2248 \u03c4\u221210 \u2261 pi\u03b3u\n2\/~, where \u03b3 = pF\/(2pi~\n2v) is the\ndensity of states of quasiparticles per spin in one valley.\nAll other types of disorder which originate from atom-\nically sharp defects [15] and break the SU\u039b2 pseudospin\nsymmetry are included in a time-inversion-symmetric [14]\n2random matrix \u03a3s\u039blus,l(r). Here, uz,z(r) describes dif-\nferent on-site energies on the A and B sublattices. Terms\nwith ux,z(r) and uy,z(r) take into account fluctuations of\nA \u001c B hopping, whereas us,x(r) and us,y(r) generate\ninter-valley scattering. In addition, warping term h\u02c6w not\nonly breaks p\u2192 \u2212p symmetry of the Fermi lines within\neach valley but also partially lifts SU\u039b2 -symmetry.\nHidden SU\u039b2 symmetry of the dominant part of H\u02c6 in\nEq. (4) enables us to classify the two-particle correla-\ntion functions, \u2019Cooperons\u2019 which determine the inter-\nference correction to the conductivity, \u03b4g by pseudospin.\nBelow, we show that \u03b4g is determined by the interplay\nof one pseudospin singlet (C0) and three triplet (Cx,y,z)\nCooperons, \u03b4g \u221d \u2212C0 + Cz + Cx + Cy , some of which\nare suppressed due to a lower symmetry of the Hamilto-\nnian in real graphene structures. That is, the \u2019warping\u2019\nterm h\u02c6w and the disorder \u03a3s\u039bzus,z suppress intravalley\nCooperons Cx,y and wash out the Berry phase effect and\nWAL, whereas intervalley disorder \u03a3s\u039bx(y)us,x(y)(r) sup-\npresses Cz and restores weak localisation [9] of electrons,\nprovided that their phase coherence is long. This results\nin a WL-type negative weak field magnetoresistance in\ngraphene, which is absent when the intervalley scatter-\ning time is long, as we discuss at the end of this Letter.\nTo describe quantum transport of 2D electrons in\ngraphene we (a) evaluate the disorder-averaged one-\nparticle Green functions, vertex corrections, Drude con-\nductivity and transport time; (b) classify Cooperon\nmodes and derive equations for those which are gapless in\nthe limit of purely potential disorder; (c) analyse \u2019Hikami\nboxes\u2019 [9, 10] for the weak localisation diagrams paying\nattention to a peculiar form of the current operator for\nDirac electrons and evalute the interference correction to\nconductivity leading to the WL magnetoresistance. In\nthese calculations, we treat trigonal warping h\u02c6w in the\nfree-electron Hamiltonian Eqs. (1,4) perturbatively, as-\nsume that potential disorder I\u02c6u(r) dominates in the elas-\ntic scattering rate, \u03c4\u22121 \u2248 \u03c4\u221210 = pi\u03b3u\n2\/~, and take into\naccount all other types of disorder when we determine\nthe relaxation spectra of low-gap Cooperons.\n(a). Standard methods of the diagrammatic technique\nfor disordered systems [9, 10] at pFv\u03c4 \u001d ~ yield the\ndisorder averaged single particle Green\u2019s function,\nG\u02c6R\/A (p, \u000f) =\n\u000fR\/A + v ~\u03a3p\n\u000f2R\/A \u2212 v\n2p2\n, \u000fR\/A = \u000f\u00b1\n1\n2 i~\u03c4\n\u22121\n0 .\nThe current operator, v\u02c6 = v~\u03a3 for the Dirac-type par-\nticles described in Eq.

Solid lines represent disorder av-\neraged GR\/A, dashed lines represent disorder.\nand valley indices. The transport time in graphene is\ntwice the scatering time, \u03c4 tr = 2\u03c40, due to the scatter-\ning anisotropy (lack of bacskattering off a potential scat-\nterer). This follows from the Einstein relation Eq. (5)\n(where spin degeneracy has been taken into account).\n(b). The WL correction to the conductivity is associ-\nated with the disorder-averaged two-particle correlation\nfunction C\u03be\u00b5,\u03be\n\u2032\u00b5\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b2,\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 known as the Cooperon. It obeys the\nBethe-Salpeter equation represented diagrammatically in\nFig. 1(c). The shaded blocks in Fig. 1(c) are infinite se-\nries of ladder diagrams, while the dashed lines represent\nthe correlator of the disorder in Eq. (4). Here, the valley\nindices (K\u00b1) of the Dirac-type electron are included as\nsuperscripts with incoming \u03be\u00b5 and outgoing \u03be\u2032\u00b5\u2032, and the\nsublattice (AB) indices as subscripts \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032.\nIt is convenient to classify Cooperons in graphene as\niso- and pseudospin singlets and triplets,\nCl1l2s1s2 =\n1\n4\n\u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b1\u2032,\u03b2\u2032,\n\u2211\n\u03be,\u00b5,\u03be\u2032,\u00b5\u2032,\n(\u03a3y\u03a3s1\u039by\u039bl1)\n\u03be\u00b5\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u00d7C\u03be\u00b5,\u03be\n\u2032\u00b5\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b2,\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 (\u03a3s2\u03a3y\u039bl2\u039by)\n\u00b5\u2032\u03be\u2032\n\u03b2\u2032\u03b1\u2032 . (6)\nSuch a classification of modes is permitted by the com-\nmutation of the iso- and pseudospin operators ~\u03a3 and\n~\u039b in Eqs. (2,3,6), [\u03a3s,\u039bl] = 0. To select the isospin\nsinglet (s = 0) and triplet (s = x, y, z) Cooperon com-\nponents (scalar and vector representation of the group\nSU\u03a32 \u2261 {e\nia~n\u00b7~\u03a3}), we project the incoming and outgo-\ning Cooperon indices onto matrices \u03a3y\u03a3s1and \u03a3s2\u03a3y, re-\nspectively. The pseudospin singlet (l = 0) and triplet\n(l = x, y, z) Cooperons (scalar and vector representation\n3of the \u2019valley\u2019 group SU\u039b2 \u2261 {e\nib~n\u00b7~\u039b}) are determined by\nthe projection of C\u03be\u00b5,\u03be\n\u2032\u00b5\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b2,\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 onto matrices \u039by\u039bl1 (\u039bl2\u039by)\nand are accounted for by superscript indices in Cl1l2s1s2 .\nFor disorder I\u02c6u(r), the equation in Fig. 1(c) is\nCl1l2s1s2 (q) = \u03c40 \u03b4\nl1l2\u03b4s1s2\n+\n1\n4pi\u03b3\u03c40~\n\u2211\ns,l\nCll2ss2 (q)\n\u222b\nd2p\n(2pi)\n2\n\u00d7 Tr\n{\n\u03a3s\u03a3y\u039bl\u039by\n[\nG\u02c6Rp,~\u03c9+\u000f\n]t\n\u039by\u039bl1\u03a3y\u03a3s1G\u02c6\nA\n~q\u2212p,\u000f\n}\n.\nIt leads to a series of coupled equations for the Cooperon\nmatrix Cl with components Cllss\u2032 . It turn out that for\npotential disorder I\u02c6u(r) isospin-singlet modes Cll00 are\ngapless in all (singlet and triplet) pseudospin channels,\nwhereas triplet modes Cllxx and C\nll\nyy have relaxation gaps\n\u0393lx = \u0393\nl\ny =\n1\n2\u03c4\n\u22121\n0 and C\nll\nzz have gaps \u0393\nl\nz = \u03c4\n\u22121\n0 . When\nobtaining the diffusion equations for the Cooperons using\nthe gradient expansion of the Bethe-Salpeter equation we\ntake into account its matrix structure.

We include all scatter-\ning mechanisms described in Eq. (4) in the correspond-\ning disorder correlator (dashed line) on the r.h.s. of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation and in the scattering rate in the\ndisorder-averagedGR\/A, as \u03c4\u221210 \u2192 \u03c4\n\u22121 = \u03c4\u221210 +\n\u2211\nsl \u03c4\n\u22121\nsl .\nFor simplicity, we assume that different types of disorder\nare uncorrelated, \u3008us,l(r)us\u2032,l\u2032(r\n\u2032)\u3009 = u2sl\u03b4ss\u2032\u03b4ll\u2032\u03b4(r \u2212 r\n\u2032)\nand, on average, isotropic in the x\u2212y plane: u2xl = u\n2\nyl \u2261\nu2\u22a5l, u\n2\nsx = u\n2\nsy \u2261 u\n2\ns\u22a5. We parametrize them by scatter-\ning rates \u03c4\u22121sl = pi\u03b3u\n2\nsl\/~, where \u03c4\n\u22121\nsx = \u03c4\n\u22121\nsy \u2261 \u03c4\n\u22121\ns\u22a5 and\n\u03c4\u22121xl = \u03c4\n\u22121\nyl \u2261 \u03c4\n\u22121\n\u22a5l due to the x\u2212 y plane isotropy of dis-\norder, which are combined into the intervalley scattering\nrate \u03c4\u22121i and the intra-valley rate \u03c4\n\u22121\nz , as\n\u03c4\u22121i = 4\u03c4\n\u22121\n\u22a5\u22a5 + 2\u03c4\n\u22121\nz\u22a5, \u03c4\n\u22121\nz = 4\u03c4\n\u22121\n\u22a5z + 2\u03c4\n\u22121\nzz . (7)\nThe trigonal warping term, h\u02c6w in the Hamiltonian (1)\nplays a crucial role for the interference effects since it\nbreaks the p \u2192 \u2212p symmetry of the Fermi lines within\neach valley: \u000f(K\u00b1,\u2212p) 6= \u000f(K\u00b1,p), while \u000f(K\u00b1,\u2212p) =\n\u000f(K\u2213,p) [8]. It has been noticed [16] that such a de-\nformation of a Fermi line of 2D electrons suppresses\nCooperons. As h\u02c6w has a similar effect, it suppresses the\npseudospin-triplet intravalley components Cx0 and C\ny\n0 , at\nthe rate\n\u03c4\u22121w = 2\u03c40\n(\n\u000f2\u00b5\/~v2\n)2\n. (8)\nHowever, since warping has an opposite effect on valleys\nK+ and K\u2212, it does not cause gaps in the intervalley\nCooperons C00 (the only true gapless Cooperon mode)\nand Cz0 .\nAltogether, the relaxation of modes Cl0 can be de-\nscribed by the following combinations of rates:\n\u039300 = 0, \u0393\nz\n0 = 2\u03c4\n\u22121\ni , \u0393\nx\n0 = \u0393\ny\n0 = \u03c4\n\u22121\nw + \u03c4\n\u22121\nz + \u03c4\n\u22121\ni \u2261 \u03c4\n\u22121\n\u2217 .\nIn the presence of an external magnetic field, B = rotA\nand inelastic decoherence, \u03c4\u22121\u03d5 , equations for C\nl\n0 \u2261 C\nll\n00\nread\n[D(i\u2207+ 2ec~A)\n2\n+ \u0393l0 + \u03c4\n\u22121\n\u03d5 \u2212 i\u03c9]C\nl\n0 (r, r\n\u2032) = \u03b4 (r\u2212 r\u2032) .\n(c). Due to the momentum-independent form of the\ncurrent operator v\u02dc =2v~\u03a3, the WL correction to conduc-\ntivity \u03b4g includes two additional diagrams, Fig. 1(e) and\n(f) besides the standard diagram shown in Fig. 1(d).\nEach of the diagrams in Fig. 1(e) and (f) [not included\nin the analysis in Ref.[11]] produces a contribution equal\nto (\u2212 14 ) of that in Fig. 1(d). This partial cancellation,\ntogether with a factor of four from the vertex corrections\nand a factor of two from spin degeneracy leads to\n\u03b4g =\n2e2D\npi~\n\u222b\nd2q\n(2pi)\n2\n(\nCx0 + C\ny\n0 + C\nz\n0 \u2212 C\n0\n0\n)\n.

They show that in graphene samples with\nthe intervalley time shorter than the decoherence time,\n\u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4 i, the quantum correction to the conductivity has\nthe WL sign. Such behavior is expected in graphene\n4B i\nB  ~  t B\n- 1\nt B  ~  t *\nt B  ~  t i\n0\nr\n(\nB\n)\n \n-\n \nr\n(\n0\n)\nFIG. 2: MR expected in a phase-coherent graphene \u03c4\u03d5 \u001d \u03c4 i:\nwith \u03c4z, \u03c4w \u001d \u03c4 i (dashed) and \u03c4\u2217 \u001c \u03c4 i (solid line). In the\ncase of \u03c4\u03d5 < \u03c4 i, \u03b4\u03c1 = 0, so that \u2206\u03c1(B) = 0.\ntightly coupled to the substrate (which generates atom-\nically sharp scatterers). Figure 2 illustrates the corre-\nsponding MR in two regimes: B\u2217 \u223c Bi (\u03c4 z , \u03c4w \u001d \u03c4 i) and\nB\u2217 \u001d Bi (\u03c4\u2217 \u001c \u03c4 i). In both cases, the low-field MR, at\nB < Bi is negative (for B\u2217 \u223c Bi, the MR changes sign at\nB \u223c Bi). A dashed line shows what one would get upon\nneglecting the effect of warping, the solid curve shows\nthe MR behavior in graphene with a high carrier density,\nwhere the effect of warping is strong and leads to a fast\nrelaxation of intravalley Cooperons, at the rate described\nin Eq. (8). Then, in Eqs. (10,11) \u03c4\u2217 \u2248 \u03c4w \u001c \u03c4 i < \u03c4\u03d5 and\nB\u2217 \u001d Bi, which determines MR of a distinctly WL type.\nNote that in the latter case MR is saturated at B \u223c Bi, in\ncontrast to the WL MR in conventional electron systems,\nwhere the logarithmic field dependence extends into the\nfield range of ~c\/4De\u03c4tr. In a sheet loosely attached to a\nsubstrate (or suspended), the intervalley scattering time\nmay be longer than the decoherence time, \u03c4 i > \u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4w\n(Bi < B\u03d5 < B\u2217). In this case, C\nz\n0 in Eq. (9) is effec-\ntively gapless and cancels C00 , whereas trigonal warping\nsuppresses the modes Cx0 and C\ny\n0 , so that \u03b4g = 0 and MR\ndisplays neither WL nor WAL behavior: \u2206\u03c1(B) = 0.\nEquation (11) explains why in the recent experiments\non the quantum transport in graphene [18] the observed\nlow-field MR displayed a suppressed WL behavior rather\nthan WAL. For all electron densities in the samples stud-\nied in [18] the estimated warping-induced relaxation time\nis rather short, \u03c4w\/\u03c4 tr \u223c 5\u00f730, \u03c4w < \u03c4\u03d5, which excluded\nany WAL. Moreover, the observation [18] of a suppressed\nWL MR in devices with a tighter coupling to the sub-\nstrate agrees with the behaviour expected in the case of\nsufficient intervalley scattering, \u03c4 i < \u03c4\u03d5, whereas the ab-\nsence of any WL MR, \u2206\u03c1(B) = 0 for a loosely coupled\ngraphene sheet is what we predict for samples with a long\nintervalley scattering time, \u03c4 i > \u03c4\u03d5.\nIn a narrow wire with the transverse diffusion time\nL2\u22a5\/D \u001c \u03c4 i, \u03c4\u2217, \u03c4\u03d5, edges scatter between valleys [17].\nThus, we estimate \u0393l0 \u223c pi\n2D\/L2\u22a5 for the pseudospin\ntriplet in a wire, whereas the singlet C00 remains gapless.\nThis yields negative magnetoresistivity for B . 2piB\u22a5,\nB\u22a5 \u2261 ~c\/eL\n2\n\u22a5:\n\u2206\u03c1wire (B)\n\u03c12\n=\n2e2L\u03d5\nh\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 1\u221a\n1 + 13B\n2\/B\u03d5B\u22a5\n\u2212 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb . (12)\nEquations (10-12) completely describe the WL effect in\ngraphene and explain how the WL magnetoresistance re-\nflects the degree of valley symmetry breaking. They show\nthat, despite the chiral nature of electrons in graphene\nsuggestive of antilocalisation, their long-range propaga-\ntion in a real disordered material or a narrow wire does\nnot manifest the chirality.\nWe thank I.Aleiner, V.Cheianov, A.Geim, P.Kim,\nO.Kashuba, and C.Marcus for discussions.
