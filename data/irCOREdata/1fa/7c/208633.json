Although the United States\nis now the greatest and most influential user of\ncomputer technology, and has and continues\nto produce great innovators, many advances\nhad their source in Europe. Today Europeans\ncontinue to play an important role in the evo-\nlution of computing.\nOne of the most interesting innovations to\ncome first from Europe was the application of\ncomputers to automating business and admin-\nistrative procedures and solving business prob-\nlems. Today, business data processing (or\nmanagement information services as it\u2019s often\ncalled in the US) in all its forms, ranging from\ntransaction processing and decision support to\ndesktop publishing and e-mail, has become the\nlargest single use for computing technology.\nThe use of computers is pervasive in all kinds\nof businesses and administrations.\nOne of the first uses of computers in the\nbusiness area came from a British food manu-\nfacturing and catering company, J. Lyons and\nCompany, and dates back to 1949.1 The case is\nof particular interest because this innovative\nuse of computers was driven by an organization\nthat had no prior experience in electronics, yet\nthey built and applied to their business one of\nthe earliest stored-program computers, the LEO\nI. Truly a case of user-driven innovation.\nThis article sets out, by means of a case\nstudy and an analysis of the case, to describe\nhow J. Lyons came to design and build the\nworld\u2019s first business computer.1-5 The analysis\nis carried out in two stages. In the first, features\nof the case are selected that might provide a\npragmatic explanation of how a food business\ncompany achieved precedence in a field where\nit might be expected that high-technology\nequipment manufacturers would be expected\nto lead. In the second stage, some theoretical\nframeworks derived from recent research into\ncompany culture and corporate success are\nexamined to see if they throw further light on\nthe case.\nThe case study\nThis study takes the case of J. Lyons to the\npoint where the company decided to design\nand build their own computer in 1949. (Much\nof the material in this case study, including\nmost of the quotations, are taken from Bird,3\nand Caminer et al.4)\nCompany background\nJ. Lyons was founded in the late 19th cen-\ntury by the successful tobacconists Salmon and\nGluckstein. The company name is derived from\na relative of the founders because, at the time,\nSalmon and Gluckstein were not confident that\nthey would make a success of the new enter-\nprise and did not want their own names asso-\nciated with a risky venture.\nSalmon and Gluckstein formed the compa-\nny in 1887 to fill a gap in the catering market.\nThey had noted that catering facilities at exhi-\nbitions and trade shows were often of a very\npoor standard. They thought there would be a\nmarket for affordable, quality food combined\nwith some entertainment at the many shows\nand exhibitions held in locations throughout\nthe country. The provision of catering facilities\nfor short duration exhibitions required metic-\nulous planning both in the sense of controlling\nthe operation with its highly-peaked activities\n16 IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 1058-6180\/00\/$10.00 \u00a9 2000 IEEE\nThe First Business Computer: A Case\nStudy in User-Driven Innovation\nFrank Land\nLondon School of Economics\nNearly half a century ago the world\u2019s first business computer\napplication was rolled out. The host for the application was a British\ncatering and food-manufacturing company, which had developed\nand built its own computer, designed for business data processing.\nThe author traces the endeavor\u2019s history and presents an analysis of\nhow and why the company\u2014J. Lyons\u2014was in a natural position to\ntake on the challenge, the precursor of the information revolution we\nsee today.\nso as to provide the quality demanded by the\npublic and at the same time to maintain tight\ncontrol of costs. \nThus J. Lyons management from their earli-\nest days developed a culture of seeking the\nmost effective ways of controlling their busi-\nness. The company expanded rapidly from suc-\ncess at catering for special events, very much a\nniche market, to becoming one of the most\nimportant and respected food companies in the\nUK. In the 1940s and 1950s J. Lyons was one of\nthe most successful businesses in the UK with\nits products, services, and establishments\u2014\nLyons Tea, Lyons Cakes, Lyons Ice Cream, the\ncatering services provided at great national\nevents such as the Buckingham Palace Royal\nGarden parties and the Wimbledon tennis\nchampionships, and the Teashops and Corner\nHouses (large, popular, but stylish London\nrestaurants)\u2014being household names. \nFrom its beginnings the company embraced\na culture of self-sufficiency. It built or acquired\nthrough purchase the capability to provide the\ngoods and services needed for the core business\nof catering. It became a vertically integrated\ncompany, with its own engineering works\ndesigning and building machinery needed by\nthe factories, body shops that built the compa-\nny\u2019s transport fleet, laboratories engaged in\nfood research, and laundries washing the com-\npany\u2019s dirty linen. Of course, where the com-\npany identified suppliers capable of meeting\nLyons\u2019 exacting standards they were used, but\nthe company ensured that such suppliers main-\ntained laid down standards.\nNevertheless, the culture of self-sufficiency\nled to a belief by management that there was\nlittle the company could not do as well or bet-\nter than any outsider. Wartime experience\nenhanced that confidence. Some of the Lyons\nfactories had been converted to the making of\nmunitions and company management prided\nitself on their efficient conversion that put the\ncompany on a wartime footing. \nLyons had built its success on quality prod-\nucts and services sold to a mass market. Selling\nto a competitive mass market required tight\ncontrol over costs and margins and a sensitive\nresponse to customer preferences and market\nmovements. Given the very large number of\ndaily transactions\u2014counted in tens of \nthousands\u2014with an average very low value and\na profit margin per transaction of a fraction of\na penny, the company could progress only by a\nconstant striving for value adding innovation.\nSenior management\u2014primarily members of\nthe founding families, the Salmons and\nGlucksteins, plus a few trusted senior employ-\nees such as George Booth, the company secre-\ntary\u2014recognized that progress could only be\nmaintained if the company hired people of\nhigh academic standing. In 1923 they hired\nJohn Simmons direct from Cambridge univer-\nsity (where he had been a Wrangler, the term\nCambridge used for the highest performers in\nthe mathematics degree, and where he had\nearned a first class honors degree in mathe-\nmatics) to join the company as a management\ntrainee and statistician. \nIn an interview1 with Chris Evans at the\nScience Museum about 1970 Simmons\nexplained: \nIn fact I was engaged to try to build up a system\nof information for the management of the com-\npany which would be superior, more sensible,\nthan just depending upon the profit and loss\naccount and such like. \u2026 in this respect the com-\npany was already ahead.\nSimmons rose rapidly in the management\nhierarchy and was responsible for introducing a\nnumber of far reaching changes in practice and\nin organization. These changes were designed\nto cope with the growth of the business and to\nachieve the control necessary for the mainte-\nnance of profits. Simmons ensured that the\ncompany kept up a continuous striving for\nimproving practice and, in doing this, intro-\nduced many innovations in particular to the\nmanagement support services. This enabled\nmanagement to keep their business under con-\nstant cost effective review. \nIn the early 1930s Simmons set up the\nSystems Research Office whose function was to\nreview existing systems; trawl the world for bet-\nter way of supporting management activities;\nand invent, test, and implement improve-\nments. The Systems Research Office, working\nwith line managers, produced a stream of busi-\nness process innovations from the time of its\nestablishment. Examples include the notion\nthat sales representatives, each having a cus-\ntomer group of many small retailers, would not\nonly be responsible for selling to their own cus-\ntomer group but would also be totally respon-\nsible for the accounting, credit, and payment\nfunctions. These functions were conventional-\nly carried out at arms length by a separate\naccounting office. The introduction of \u201ctravel-\ner covered credit\u201d was a radical business process\ninnovation, which increased efficiency and the\neffectiveness of the representative\u2014the sales\nrepresentative took responsibility for the\naccounting necessary to maintain a customer\naccount.\nJuly\u2013September 2000 17\nBefore World War II the Systems Research\nOffice had for many years been investigating\nthe possibility of coping with the mass of trans-\naction data by some kind of mechanization or\nautomation. They had started to investigate the\npossibility of devising a document reader for\ntransaction data. They had researched the pos-\nsible application of a unit record systems based\non punched cards but rejected these as too\nlocalized, too constraining, and too costly.\nLyons had only one punched card installation\nand that had a very limited application.\nInstead, the company had installed alternative\ntypes of office mechanization based on\naccounting machines and calculators. \nBy 1946 Simmons had been promoted to\nthe post of chief comptroller responsible for all\nthe management accounting and support func-\ntions in the business, and in 1950 he joined the\nfamily dominated Lyons\u2019 board as an employee\ndirector. In 1932 Lyons engaged another\nCambridge Wrangler, T.R. Thompson, who had\npreviously been employed as assistant secretary\nto a large Liverpool store. Under Simmons\u2019\ntutelage Thompson also rose rapidly in the\norganization and by 1946 had reached the posi-\ntion of chief assistant comptroller.\nJohn Kay6 in his study of what makes busi-\nnesses successful suggests that architecture, by\nwhich he means the structure and style of\nresponsibilities and relationships, is one of the\nimportant enablers. Over the years Lyons had\ndeveloped a distinct management style based\non the way information was passed from oper-\nations\u2014manufacturing, selling, distribution, as\nwell as the concomitant operations concerned\nwith invoicing and payments\u2014to the decision\nmaking senior management. Each of the many\nbusinesses (tea, teashops, ice cream, bakeries,\nkitchens, outside catering, and so on) had their\nown groups of clerks and managers. The vast\nmass of transaction data stemming from these\noperations was summarized and compared\nwith preset standards, forecasts, and budgets.\nThe resulting information was analyzed by the\njunior manager in charge of each group, who\nwould be responsible for explaining any impor-\ntant variances. (In the Lyons grading structure,\njunior managers were placed in the F or super-\nvisor grade and not deemed managers. Many of\nthem rose to manager rank in their subsequent\ncareers and some reached the very top of the\norganization.) The junior manager had a direct\nline to the senior manager, often a Lyons direc-\ntor, responsible for that activity and to whom\nthe functioning of that activity had to be\nexplained. At the same time the senior manag-\ner could ask the junior liaison manager to\nundertake investigations of the \u201cwhat if\u201d\ntype\u2014suppose we wish to increase the produc-\ntion of Swiss rolls by 10 percent and reduce the\nproduction of cupcakes by 3 percent, what\nwould be the effect on gross profit? The\narrangement ensured direct access by senior\nmanagement to information originating at the\noperating level and bypassed the more usual fil-\ntering through layers of middle management.\nThis management style provided the com-\npany, long before the advent of computers, with\nboth an almost real-time management infor-\nmation system and a decision support system of\nconsiderable sophistication. In addition, the\narchitecture and system provided senior man-\nagement with a detailed picture of the week\u2019s\ntrading on the Monday of the following week.\nYet in many other ways the company was\ndeeply traditional and conservative. It operat-\ned on a strictly hierarchical basis. At the top\nwere the owners, the founding families. They\nran the company with the help of very few\nemployee directors. Each grade of management\nhad its own dining room. Separate toilets divid-\ned managers from the rest. As might be expect-\ned in a company with these types of\nrelationships, interaction between employees\nwas conducted in a formal way with formal\nmodes of address, particularly to one\u2019s superi-\nors in the hierarchy. Sports were encouraged\nand a great variety of team games took place\nwith enthusiasm on the company\u2019s large sports\ngrounds. Trade unions were discouraged,\nthough the family took a paternalistic interest\nin its staff. \nNevertheless, top management encouraged\ninnovation in working practices7 whether in\nthe factory with the design and introduction of\ncontinuous ovens for the manufacture of miles\nof Swiss rolls per day, or in the office with the\nadoption of microfilm to provide a single\nrecord of orders received that served as delivery\nnote and invoice. Management insisted, how-\never, that all new practices had to be tested and\nprototyped until most elements of risk had\nbeen eliminated.\nInitiation\nIn May 1947 two senior company execu-\ntives, Thompson and Oliver Standingford\u2014\nanother assistant comptroller who had joined\nLyons in 1930 as a management trainee\u2014visit-\ned the US to see what developments in office\nequipment had taken place since the start of\nWorld War II. They found little significant\nchange in office equipment. But they did hear\nabout experiments with electronic brains, such\nas the engineering numerical integrator and\n18 IEEE Annals of the History of Computing\nFirst Business Computer\ncomputer, or ENIAC, used exclusively for mili-\ntary, scientific, and engineering calculations.\nThey recognized quickly that the characteris-\ntics of the machines they saw could be modi-\nfied to provide the necessary capabilities to\nsolve some of the problems of business data\nprocessing. They visited a number of the pio-\nneers and were particularly impressed by\nHoward Aiken at Harvard whose practical\nappreciation of bringing equipment into reli-\nable operation mirrored their own ideas of the\nproblems that they might face \nThompson and Standingford discovered\nthat few of the pioneers had thought about the\npossibility of applying the machines to busi-\nness operations, though American Prudential\nInsurance Company had already established\nplans to use a computer for premium billing\nand actuarial calculations. Both Aiken at\nHarvard and Goldstine at Princeton told them\nthat England\u2019s Cambridge university under\nProfessor Douglas Hartree\u2014a mathematical\nphysicist\u2014had started work on the electronic\ndelay storage automatic calculator (EDSAC). In\nMay 1949 EDSAC would become the world\u2019s\nfirst stored program computer to do regular\nmathematical work.\nOn their return to England Thompson and\nStandingford visited Cambridge where they\nwere introduced to Maurice Wilkes, director of\nthe mathematical laboratory, who had started\nwork on the EDSAC. They were most impressed\nwith the advances in the technology, well\nbeyond anything they had seen in the US.\nHowever they wrote: \nProgress on the machine is slow and they talk of\n12-18 months before completion. They have all\ntheir plans drawn and the hold-up is purely due\nto lack of money. Dr Wilkes and one draughts-\nman assistant alone are handling the job, assist-\ned at the moment by two vacation students. We\ntold them that unless they could proceed more\nrapidly they may find the machines for sale in\nAmerica before they complete their first model.\nWe were told that given \u00a32000 they could com-\nplete much more rapidly. Both Professor Hartree\nand Dr Wilkes were willing and keen to co-oper-\nate with us, in particular they are interested in\napplying their machine to any clerical job we\nmay suggest.8\nHaving gathered all the information they\nthought they needed, Thompson and\nStandingford produced a report for the Lyons\nboard, which they first showed to Simmons.\nWith Simmons full backing they presented the\nreport to the board, with a cover memorandum\nthat included inter alia the following statement:\nWe believe that we have been able to get a\nglimpse of a development which will in a few\nyears time, have a profound effect on the way in\nwhich clerical work (at least) is performed. Here,\nfor the first time, there is a possibility of a\nmachine which will be able to cope, at almost\nincredible speed, with any variation of clerical\nprocedures, provided the conditions which gov-\nern the variations is predetermined. What effect\nsuch machines could have on the semi-repetitive\nwork of the office needs only the slightest effort\nof imagination. The possible savings from such\na machine should, be at least \u00a350,000 a year. The\ncapital cost would be of the order of \u00a3100,000.\nWe feel, therefore, that the Company might\nwell wish to take a lead in the development of\nthe machine and indeed that, unless organisa-\ntions such as ours, the potential users, are pre-\npared to do so, the time at which they become\ncommercially available will be unnecessarily\npostponed for many years.\nThe report describes details of Thompson and\nStandingford\u2019s visits and the ideas discussed\nwith some of the computer pioneers. It describes\nhow the computer works, suggests how the\nmathematical computers might need to be mod-\nified for business use, and goes on to indicate a\nnumber of possible applications and how they\nmight be handled on the computer. These\nincluded ideas for a variety of transaction pro-\ncessing applications, but also hint at the possi-\nbility of using the computer for word processing. \nUnder the heading \u201cSteps that might be\ntaken by Lyons to advance the development of\nElectronic Machines\u201d they wrote:\nOur first concern is, of course, the advantage\nwhich Lyons may gain from the commercial\ndevelopment of electronic machines, but there\nis a wider aspect which cannot be overlooked.\nThis machine may well be a prime factor in\nJuly\u2013September 2000 19\nIn May 1949 EDSAC would\nbecome the world\u2019s first\nstored program computer \nto do regular \nmathematical work.\nrelieving the present economic distress of the\ncountry. In this respect we cannot help but feel\nthat Lyons occupies a key position; no-one else\nhere, as far as we can learn, has realised the far-\nreaching possibilities of electronic machines.\nWe assume that Lyons will want to take full\nadvantage of these machines for their own\noffices. It is possible for us to play a passive role\nby merely keeping in touch with developments,\nand in due course buying machines as they\nbecome available, probably from American\nsources. But such a role would not enable us to\nhave any influence on the kind of machine built,\nand without commercial influence they may be\nbuilt in a form more suited to handling mathe-\nmatical and census calculations owing to the\ninfluence of the large governmental concerns.\nFinally, the report laid out five possible\nstrategies for the Lyons board to consider that\nwould enable the company to apply computer\ntechnology. These included the suggestion that\nLyons should support the efforts of Wilkes at\nCambridge with a financial grant and at the\nsame time provide him with examples of cleri-\ncal procedures to use in programming experi-\nments. An alternative strategy suggested that:\nWe could build a machine in our own workshops\ndrawing on information and advice from\nHarvard University.\nThe board was persuaded to accept the basic\nrecommendation that Lyons should itself take\nthe initiative to acquire a computer for its office\nwork. Once Booth, the company secretary, had\nthrown his support behind the recommenda-\ntion there was no dissension among board\nmembers. They agreed to support the\nCambridge venture but to work towards build-\ning their own machine with the help of Wilkes\nand his team. The board also agreed to help\nfinance the work at Cambridge with a grant of\n\u00a33000, the money to be made available as soon\nas Cambridge could demonstrate that the\nEDSAC could carry out serious mathematical\nwork. In addition, Lyons offered to make one\nof their own people, Ernest Lenaerts, who had\nbeen a clerk in the Lyons offices prewar but had\nworked on radar during the war, available to\nCambridge. Lenaerts, whose formal education\nhas finished with high school examinations\n(matriculations), became an important con-\ntributor to the development of EDSAC and later\na key person in the design and building of\nLyons\u2019 computer.\nIn return for the Lyons help package,\nCambridge agreed to help Lyons design and\nbuild their own computer and to help recruit a\nchief engineer, Dr. John Pinkerton, to head the\ntechnical side of the project. A project team was\nestablished and work commenced in 1949 to\ndesign and build the computer. Simmons sug-\ngested a name for the machine\u2014Lyons\nElectronic Office, or LEO. \nLEO differed from EDSAC in that it was\ndesigned specifically for large-scale data pro-\ncessing with multiple buffered input and out-\nput channels, capable of being linked to a\nvariety of input and output devices. By 1951\nthe LEO team had built the basic computer and\nthe first experimental, but regular, business\napplication was being run for the Lyons bak-\neries. Further work in linking input and output\ndevices, extending the store, and improving\nreliability continued until in December 1953,\nLEO I was formally declared completed and\nready for full-scale operational work.\nDiscussion and analysis\nTo many observers the notion of a catering\ncompany in England shortly after World War II\nsuccessfully pioneering what is now called the\ninformation revolution seems unlikely and\nincredible. Lyons not only recognized the\npotential role of electronic computers for busi-\nness data processing but actually designed and\nbuilt such a machine. Indeed, the US edition of\nthe book User-Driven Innovation: The World\u2019s\nFirst Business Computer4 is called LEO\u2014The\nIncredible Story of the World\u2019s First Business\nComputer.1\nThe pragmatic explanation\nYet looking at J. Lyons in the period after\nWorld War II, their recognition of computers as\na way ahead and the decision to build their\nown should not be regarded as surprising.\nThere are a number of features in the way the\ncompany had developed and was organized in\nthe immediate postwar period (1945-1955) that\nprovided the basis for the pioneering move\ninto business computing.\nThe nature of the business. The business\nwas characterized by the very large range of\nfood products and food providing services. This\nwas supported by a range of company owned\nand managed services. The company sold its\nproducts directly to the retail trade or through\nits catering outlets directly to the public. This\nresulted in a mass of transactions with relative-\nly low average values. Competitiveness depend-\ned on advantageous pricing of its products.\nThus the company was constantly fighting to\ncontain or reduce its costs of doing business\u2014\n20 IEEE Annals of the History of Computing\nFirst Business Computer\nits transaction costs in the parlance of econo-\nmists. Hence, its constant search for improving\nits business processes in all aspects of the busi-\nness including manufacture; distribution; sup-\nply; and most relevant to the decision to\nexperiment with electronic computers, the sup-\nport services provided by the office. The latter\nwere responsible for the standard processes\nassociated with bookkeeping and accounts,\npayment of suppliers, charging customers, and\npaying the staff but also with the management\nsupport activities of providing management\ninformation. By the middle 1930s the compa-\nny had established a systems research office to\nput the search for improved methods onto a\nmore formal footing.\nPersonnel and leadership. Senior manage-\nment recognized that to sustain the growth and\ncompetitiveness of the company it had to have\ntop-class management. Lyons was one of the\nearliest companies to establish a management\ntrainee scheme and many of the people later\ninvolved with the LEO enterprise first joined\nLyons as management trainees. These included\nStandingford and Thompson. David Caminer,\nprobably the world\u2019s first business program-\nming manager, joined Lyons as a management\ntrainee in 1936, became head of the systems\nresearch office, and joined the LEO team as one\nof its first members.\nBy recruiting people with top-class academic\nqualifications, such as Simmons and Thompson,\nand permitting them to take leadership roles in\nthe management of the company, the Lyons\nmanagement ensured that it was never short of\nideas on how to improve. This was reflected in\nthe esteem in which the company was held in\nthe first half of the 20th century. Their leading\nrole in developing systems was widely acknowl-\nedged beyond the boundaries of their industry\nsector. Simmons played a leading role in the\nestablishment of the Institute of Administrative\nManagement and was elected as its first presi-\ndent. It is in keeping with this tradition that\nThompson and Standingford could claim in\ntheir report that it was almost a duty for Lyons\nto get directly involved in the design of a com-\nputer for business applications to solve the crit-\nical problems of the nation (see preceding\nquotation from the report).\nSelf-sufficiency. The economist Oliver\nWilliamson,9,10 suggests that firms have two\ntypes of strategies for coping with transaction\ncosts. The first, which he calls hierarchies,\ninvolves vertical integration. The firm attempts\nto minimize transaction costs and retain con-\ntrol by becoming as self-sufficient as possible.\nThe second strategy, which he calls markets,\ninvolves going to the market (or outsourcing in\ntoday\u2019s parlance) for all but the core activities\nof the business. Companies minimize costs by\nusing the mechanisms of the marketplace and\nretain control through contractual arrange-\nments with suppliers.\nLyons, in general, preferred the first strategy\nbecause they had the confidence and experi-\nence to believe they could provide the relevant\ngoods or services more effectively than any\ncontractor. Of course, some goods and services\nhad to be subcontracted or purchased when\ninvestigations showed that appropriate suppli-\ners were available. But even then, Lyons, like\nMarks and Spencer (one of the UK\u2019s leading\nretailers), set up an organization that set stan-\ndards and ensured that the suppliers them-\nselves were efficient and were always seeking\nimprovements. Thus it did not take Lyons long\nto realize that outside suppliers capable of\nmeeting the requirements envisioned by\nSimmons and Thompson simply did not exist\nin the late 1940s. The company had confidence\nbased on previous experience\u2014including the\nvery recent experiences of the war\u2014that they\nwere capable of effectively organizing busi-\nnesses remote from their core food business.\nThe academic frameworks\nRecent research throws some light on the\nconditions that have to be fulfilled if an enter-\nprise is to be successful and capable of sus-\ntained innovation. Does the research and the\nframeworks developed help explain how the\nLyons of the 1940s and 1950s came to be first\nin the development of computers working on\nbusiness applications?\nJuly\u2013September 2000 21\nBy recruiting people with top\nacademic qualifications and\npermitting them to take\nleadership roles, the Lyons\nmanagement ensured that it\nwas never short of ideas on\nhow to improve. \nGoffee and Jones. The most recent study is\nby Goffee and Jones11 and reports on research\nthat they are conducting on the relationship\nbetween company success and different styles\nof company culture. They distinguish between\ntwo dimensions of culture. The first dimension\nis concerned with the degree of sociability\nachieved by the employees of the organization.\nThe second is concerned with the degree of sol-\nidarity present among the employees. \nBy sociability Goffee and Jones mean a cul-\nture that regards the organization as a commu-\nnity and encourages sincere friendship among\nits employees. Relationships are often more\nimportant than measures of performance.\nHence it is rare to point the finger at a colleague\nwho is under performing. Employees tend to\nshare values and a high value is put on achiev-\ning consensus, even if that means engaging in\ncompromise. Esprit de corps tends to be high;\nteamwork flourishes; and \u201ca spirit of openness\nto new ideas, and freedom to accept out-of-the-\nbox thinking\u201d prevails. There is a wide range of\nsociability in organizations, from enterprises\nwith few social contacts and few good rela-\ntionships to enterprises that offer a well-bal-\nanced community or family.\nSolidarity, in contrast, implies shared objec-\ntives rather than shared values. \u201cIts relationships\nare based on common tasks, mutual interests, or\nshared goals that will benefit all involved par-\nties.\u201d The organization will respond quickly to\noutside threats, and low-level performers are not\ntolerated. Members regard achieving consensus\nas having a low value and think it works against\nachieving high performance targets and could\neven help competitors. A good example is where\nin an effort to achieve consensus, difficult deci-\nsions are delayed, permitting a sharper com-\npetitor to take the lead. Employees are clear\nabout job definitions and organizational roles.\nAgain organizations vary enormously in the\ndegree of solidarity achieved.\nGoffee and Jones note that successful organ-\nizations can exist at all points in the two\ndimensions, including the extremes. They go\non to suggest that we can classify organiza-\ntional culture into four archetypes: networked,\ncommunal, fragmented, and mercenary. Each\narchetype is associated with a position on the\nsociability and solidarity dimensions. Again,\neach can be the basis of a successful enterprise,\nthough they suggest that it is possible to devise\na contingency framework that indicates the\nbest fit between the cultural archetype and the\nenterprise. Goffee and Jones plot the two\ndimensions of culture, sociability, and solidari-\nty against the four archetypes in a two by two\ntable, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nDoes the Lyons of the 1940s and 1950s fit\ninto this model? I used the assessment question-\nnaire provided by Goffee and Jones (see Figure 2)\nand rated Lyons in terms of sociability as mod-\nerately high. (Note: This questionnaire was not\nadministered to a sample of Lyons\u2019 employees\nfrom the 1940s and 1950s, but was completed by\nthe author and an ex-LEO colleague.) The rather\nformal, hierarchical structure of the firm was off-\nset by the paternalistic attitude of the founding\nfamily, reflected by the social activities sponsored\nby the company. There were a large number of\nsocial events organized through a variety of cul-\ntural and sporting clubs. A relatively large num-\nber of employees took part in social events and\noften participated with their families. In these\nclubs, rank within the company, except at the\nmost senior level, played little part. Ability at\nfootball, or chess, or bridge, or organizing con-\ncerts counted for more and led to esteem among\nthe peer group. There was undoubtedly a Lyons\nesprit de corps. Sometimes newcomers found it\ndifficult to enter established networks of friend-\nship. This is in keeping with Goffee and Jones\u2019\nfindings that report the formation of cliques in\nsome of the organizations that rated high on the\nscale of sociability.\nIn terms of the other dimension, solidarity,\nusing the questionnaire Lyons scored a some-\nwhat higher rating then on the sociability scale.\nThe company introduced management by\nobjectives as a way of ensuring that all employ-\nees had a definition of what was expected of\nthem and, indeed, participated in the definition\nof the roles and the way performance was meas-\nured. Company solidarity was reflected in the\narrogance with which members of the Lyons\nstaff regarded competitors. There was a general\nfeeling that Lyons the company and Lyons\nemployees were an elite.\n22 IEEE Annals of the History of Computing\nFirst Business Computer\nSociability\nHigh\nLow\nNetworked\nFragmented\nCommunal\nMercenary\nLow High\nSolidarity\nFigure 1. Two dimensions, four cultures.\nAs Goffee and Jones\npoint out many managers\nassume that the top right\nhand quadrant of Figure 1,\nscoring high on both the\nsociability and solidarity\ndimensions, the commu-\nnal type of culture, is the\nmost likely to indicate a\nsuccessful company. But\ntheir research suggested\nthat the communal type of\nculture tends to be unsta-\nble and is rarely sustained.\nSome of the characteristics\nof high sociability, for\nexample, the reluctance to\n\u201cshop\u201d the low-level per-\nformer, are inherently in\nconflict with the high soli-\ndarity characteristics of\nputting a high value on\nbusiness objectives.\nNevertheless, they did find\nin existence organizations\ncharacterized as commu-\nnal and for which that\ntype of culture was appro-\npriate and associated with\nsuccess. Goffee and Jones\nsuggest that strong, charis-\nmatic, leadership that\nbelieves in the values asso-\nciated with sociability but,\nat the same time, is\nabsolutely clear on the\ndirection the company is\ndriving and doesn\u2019t permit\nsubpar performance is nec-\nessary to sustain the com-\nmunal culture.\nThe Lyons of the 1940s and 1950s fits rea-\nsonably well into the communal culture quad-\nrant, scoring quite well on sociability and\nsomewhat higher on solidarity. Does this help to\nanswer the question of how they came to make\nthe decision to design and build a business com-\nputer to serve their management?\nGoffee and Jones found three features com-\nmon to enterprises that could be described as\nhaving communal cultures and were success-\nful over a long period.\nThey found that successful communal cul-\ntures are associated with organizations in\nwhich extensive teamwork across functions\nmakes innovation possible. They give as an\nexample a pharmaceutical company (Glaxo\nWellcome) in which competitive success is\nbased on a continuous stream of patent-pro-\ntected product innovation. But, although\nproduct innovation is important in the food\nbusiness, there is little protection against copy-\ning, and more competitive advantages may be\ngained from process innovation both in man-\nufacturing processes and support service\nprocesses. In Lyons, process innovation was\nencouraged through suggestion schemes and\nmore formally via the activities of the systems\nresearch office. A stream of new ideas bubbled\nup through the organization and many were\nimplemented over the years. Perhaps the same\nconditions that encourage product innovation\nin the pharmaceutical industry stimulated the\nkind of process innovation that led Lyons\ntowards the recognition that computers would\nJuly\u2013September 2000 23\nFigure 2. Goffee and Jones\u2019 organization assessment questionnaire.\nWhat is your Organization\u2019s Culture\nTo assess your organization\u2019s level of sociability, answer the following ques-\ntions:\nLow Medium High\n1. People here try to make friends and to \nkeep their relationships strong \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n2. People here get along well \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n3. People in our group often socialise\noutside the office \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n4. People here really like one another \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n5. When people leave our group, we stay in touch \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n6. People here do favours for others\nbecause they like one another \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n7. People here often confide in one another\nabout personal matters \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nTo assess your organization\u2019s level of solidarity, answer the following\nquestions:\n1. Our group understands and shares \nthe same business objectives \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n2. Work gets done effectively and productively \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n3. Our group takes strong action to address\npoor performance \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n4. Our collective will to win is high \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n5. When opportunities for competitive advantage\narise, we move quickly to capitalize on them \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n6. We share the same strategic goals \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\n7. We know who he competition is \u0002 \u0002 \u0002\nhelp to make them more efficient and effective.\nIn Lyons, the stream of ideas for improvement\ncould only be effectively implemented if the\nnecessary teamwork was deeply embedded in\nthe culture.\nAgain the confidence to take on new types\nof work like designing a computer inside the\norganization rather than going outside to spe-\ncialist contractors stems from the same com-\nmunal characteristics.\nGoffee and Jones\u2019 second feature of a suc-\ncessful communal culture is that there are real\nsynergies among organizational subunits and\nreal opportunities for learning. Again these\nappear to be important characteristics when it\ncomes to disseminating and implementing the\nrange of innovations discussed previously.\nLyons encouraged the synergy and learning by\nwidely broadcasting throughout the organiza-\ntion what the company was attempting in its\nLEO venture. Although the rapid growth of the\nLEO team necessitated recruiting, mainly of\nnew graduates from the outside, many of the\nearly LEO team members came from a variety\nof job functions inside Lyons. This, too, facili-\ntated mutual learning and synergy. \nThe third finding of Goffee and Jones sug-\ngests that a communal culture is important in\norganizations that have to take a long view\u2014\nwhere strategies are long-term rather than\nshort-term. Clearly the Lyons decision to build\nand apply a computer looks like a long-term\nstrategy, and thus supports the notion that a\ncommunal culture would enable long-term\nviews to be taken. However, it is worth noting\nthat the Lyons management was somewhat\noptimistic both on how long it would take to\nget the computer built and online and the time\nit would take to pay off the investment. Early\nestimates suggested that a time period of about\ntwo years for building the computer and a fur-\nther two years to recover the costs would be\nneeded. Perhaps a planning horizon of four\nyears might be regarded as taking a long view\nin the food industry. There is no doubt that the\nLyons management looked at the possibility of\ncomputers as one that influenced not only the\nlong-term strategy of the company itself, but as\nsomething that might affect the whole direc-\ntion of business practice in the UK.\nGoffee and Jones note that organizations\noperating in a dynamic and complex business\nenvironment benefited from having a commu-\nnal culture. In the immediate postwar period\nalmost all businesses were faced with the tran-\nsition from working on a wartime footing to\nthat of peacetime. In the food industry the con-\ntinuing problems of food rationing increased\nthis complexity. Perhaps Lyons survived the\ncomplexities of the postwar period by having a\ncommunal culture. More importantly it is a\nculture that enabled the company to behave in\na dynamic manner.\nWhat Goffee and Jones\u2019 research point to is\nthat culture provides the environment in\nwhich success or failure is played out. Certain\ntypes of culture facilitate or enable organiza-\ntional behavior. The communal culture Lyons\nappeared to have in the 1940s and 1950s would\nlead us to expect a company that encouraged\nand welcomed innovation and was confident\nand capable of taking the long view and make\nlong-term strategic judgments. It appears that\nit was a company capable of learning and\ntherefore absorbing change and innovation.\nGoffee and Jones\u2019 research helps us place Lyons\nin its cultural context and to understand how\nthe particular strengths of that culture could\nlead to the decisions they made.\nJohn Kay. The second framework is derived\nfrom John Kay.6 His research into what factors\nunderlie corporate success found that four dis-\ntinctive capabilities are associated with the suc-\ncessful enterprise. Kay notes that particular\narchitectures, good reputation, a flow of inno-\nvation, and the presence of strategic assets are\ncharacteristics associated with successful enter-\nprises. Any one of these can help to distinguish\nan enterprise and lead to its success. Although,\nusually more than one of the capabilities are\npresent, and the presence of one can lead to\nothers. Thus an appropriate architecture can\nhelp the business become a successful innova-\ntor, which in turn can ensure a sustained and a\nhigh reputation.\nBy architecture Kay means the set of formal\nand informal relations that exist in the enter-\nprise. Kay describes architecture as \u201c...a network\nof relational contracts within, or around, the\nfirm.\u201d As noted previously, Lyons had devel-\noped a management style\u2014really an architec-\nture in Kay\u2019s sense\u2014that provided clear\ninformation channels between operational and\nmanagement levels unblocked by problems of\nhierarchy and its associated bureaucracy. This\nhad three effects. It brought operational man-\nagement and their supervisors into close con-\ntact with senior level management, resulting in\nmutual trust and esteem and hence, effective\nteamwork despite the existence of a notional\nhierarchy. Next, it made quick decision making\npossible at the senior level. Finally, it enabled\nnew ideas bubbling up from the lower levels to\nbe brought to the attention of senior manage-\nment and acted upon speedily.\n24 IEEE Annals of the History of Computing\nFirst Business Computer\nReviewing the case study it is clear that\nLyons in the period under discussion had been\na company in which a flow of innovations\n(both process innovations concerned primari-\nly with administrative procedures in the offices,\nand technical processes in the manufacturing\nunits) and product innovations were facilitat-\ned by the distinct architecture developed by the\ncompany. Later all three consequences of the\narchitecture helped to start the LEO project.\nThe mutual trust engendered by the manage-\nment style and architecture enabled the Lyons\nboard to respond positively and quickly to the\nreport produced by Thompson and Standing-\nford without the delays (and obfuscation) gen-\nerated by some other architectures. \nThe second distinctive capability identified by\nKay is reputation. Kay illustrates the role of rep-\nutation in sustaining company success. A good\nillustration from today (not from Kay) of the role\nplayed by reputation is the Virgin organization\nand its charismatic founder Richard Branson.\nBranson made his reputation early by founding a\nsuccessful record business. This reputation has\ncarried over to the extent that the market\nappears willing to provide support for Branson\nwhenever he branches into businesses that\nappear to be dominated by established corpora-\ntions, such as Coca Cola, British Airways, or the\nmajor financial services companies. \nThe fact that Lyons had established a reputa-\ntion of \u201ccan do\u201d in catering and food manufac-\nturing and in World War II in making munitions\nmade it more believable that it could also make\na success of computers. Management had the\nconfidence that they could make computers\nsuitable for business needs, where they also\nbelieved that more conventional electronic and\nbusiness machine companies would be much\nslower off the mark. Lyons\u2019 management had a\nbelief in their company reputation. But to suc-\nceed they needed others to share that belief.\nWould Cambridge university have been willing\nto collaborate with Lyons in building LEO as a\nsuccessor to EDSAC if they did not share the\nconfidence in the Lyons reputation? Subse-\nquently, despite some skepticism, Lyons\u2019 repu-\ntation and in particular the reputation of certain\nindividuals, such as John Simmons, played a\nmajor role in the successful launch of LEO Com-\nputers as a vendor of business computers.\nThe third distinctive capability in the Kay\nframework is innovation. He notes that it is\noften not enough for an enterprise to have the\nability to make innovations. Too often the\ninnovator does not reap the benefit of the inno-\nvation or cannot sustain the advantages which\nthe innovations were expected to convey. He\nargues that it requires other distinct capabilities,\nnotably architecture, to enable innovation to\ntranslate into business success. Kay\u2019s notion of\narchitecture comes close to the concept of cul-\nture as defined by Goffee and Jones. \nLyons appears to have had the architecture\ncharacterized by their communal culture to\nwelcome and accept process innovations of a\nquite radical nature. Whether they had the\ncapability to reap the benefits of all the inno-\nvations and, in particular, their pioneering\nefforts in adapting information technology to\nthe business, requires analysis of the later stages\nof the initiation, dissemination, and imple-\nmentation of the technology.\nThe final distinct capability identified by Kay\nis the availability of strategic assets. Strategic\nassets to Kay comprise features such as the pos-\nsibility of controlling the market via a monop-\noly position. Perhaps the LEO venture was made\npossible by the existence of a supply-side vacu-\num. Lyons\u2019 strategic asset was the lack of a viable\nsupplier in the UK just at the time that\nThompson and Standingford produced their\nreport. Another strategic asset was the availabil-\nity within the Lyons organization of employees\nof the caliber of Simmons, Thompson,\nStandingford, and Caminer. Without this very\ndistinctive asset it is doubtful whether Lyons\nwould have initiated the LEO project and built\nthe world\u2019s first business computer.\nA feature of Lyons at that time was that they\nhad developed strength in all four of Kay\u2019s dis-\ntinct capabilities, and that they reinforced each\nother. The right architecture led to innovation.\nSuccessful innovations improved reputation.\nLyons had become an acknowledged leader in\ninnovation for administrative efficiency. The\nstrategic asset of the lack of supply-side com-\npetition was perhaps fortuitous, but having the\nright people on board was a consequence both\nof reputation \u2014the best people wanted to work\nfor Lyons\u2014and of the architecture.\nJuly\u2013September 2000 25\nLyons appears to have had\nthe architecture to welcome\nand accept process\ninnovations of a quite \nradical nature. \nConclusion\nAll three strands in the analysis\u2014that based\non a pragmatic analysis of the case history and\nthose based on the academic frameworks\u2014con-\ntribute to our retrospective understanding of\nhow Lyons came to initiate such an unlikely\nventure as to invent the business computer.\nRetrospective analysis is always easier than pre-\ndiction. Do the three bases of analysis used in\nthe article, individually or in combination,\nenable us to predict which enterprises will lead\n(successfully) in innovation and which are\nmore likely to be followers? These bases may\nhelp us identify enterprises that have in place\nthe conditions for making successful and sus-\ntained innovation possible. They may also help\nidentify the businesses that are unlikely to take\nup a leadership role via innovation. However,\nno single framework provides certain answers.\nUsed in combination they may provide greater\npowers of analysis. \nInnovation theory itself has produced a\nnumber of theoretical models and frameworks.\nMany of these emphasize the diffusion and\nadaption phases of the innovation phenome-\nnon and are less relevant to the earlier inven-\ntion and initiation phases. In the later stages of\nthis study, analyzing the adoption by Lyons of\nthe LEO computer and the diffusion of the\ntechnology first through Lyons and then many\nother companies, more use is made of theories\nof technology transfer12-15 including those\nwhich are specifically tailored to the special\ncase of information technology and informa-\ntion systems.16-18\nReferences\n1.
