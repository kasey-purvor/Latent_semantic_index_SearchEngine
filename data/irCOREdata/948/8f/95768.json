(2009) EU Kids Online and EU Kids Online II. \nZeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychologie (Horizons), 217(4), 4-7. \n \n \nEU Kids Online \nFunded by the European Commission\u2019s Safer Internet Programme, EU Kids Online (2006-9) is a \nthematic network that aimed to identify, compare and draw conclusions from existing and ongoing \nresearch on children and online technologies conducted in Europe.  Having constructed a publicly \naccessible and searchable database of nearly 400 studies conducted across Europe, it became \nclear to EU Kids Online that research is unevenly distributed across Europe, with most in Germany, \nthe UK, Denmark and least in Cyprus, Bulgaria, Poland, Iceland, Slovenia and Ireland.  Although \nmost countries strategically shape the research agenda through collaboration among universities, \nresearch councils, government ministries and, sometimes, industry, in countries where little \nresearch funding exists, the EC has significantly shaped the research agenda. In countries where \ninternet use is high, media coverage tends to focus the research agenda on risks and safety \nawareness. \nFindings \u2013 online use and risk \nChildren\u2019s use of the internet continues to grow. Striking recent rises are evident among younger \nchildren, in countries which have recently entered the EU, and among parents, reversing the \nprevious trend for teenagers especially to outstrip adults in internet use. Long-standing gender \ninequalities may be disappearing, though socio-economic inequalities persist in most countries.  \nAcross Europe, despite some cross-national variation, available findings suggest that for online \nteenagers, the rank ordering of risks experienced is fairly similar. Giving out personal information is \nthe most common risky behaviour, followed by encountering pornography online, then by seeing \nviolent or hateful content. Being bullied online comes fourth, followed by receiving unwanted sexual \ncomments. Meeting an online contact offline appears the least common though arguably the most \ndangerous risk. \nEven though higher status parents are more likely than those of lower status to provide their \nchildren with access to the internet, it seems that the children from lower status homes are more \nexposed to risk online. There are also gender differences in risk, with boys more likely to encounter \n(or create) conduct risks and with girls more affected by content and contact risks.  Countries were \nclassified by degree of children\u2019s internet use and degree of risk online. This suggests a positive \ncorrelation between use and risk: Northern European countries tend to be \u201chigh use, high risk\u201d; \nSouthern European countries tend to be \u201clow use, low risk\u201d; and Eastern European countries tend \nto be \u201cnew use, new risk\u201d. \nPolicy recommendations \u2013 maximising opportunities \nE-inclusion policies should target countries where children\u2019s internet use is relatively low (Italy, \nGreece, Cyprus), along with certain population segments (less well-off households, parents who are \nnot online) if the remaining 25% of EU children are to get online.  Balancing empowerment and \nprotection is crucial, since increasing online access and use tends to increase online risks; \nconversely, strategies to decrease risks can restrict children\u2019s online opportunities, possibly \nundermining children\u2019s rights or restricting their learning to cope with a degree of risk.  Balancing \nthese competing goals requires a mix of regulation, media literacy and improved interface design. \nPositive online provision is also important: there are growing indications that such provision, if \n 2\nvalued by children, directly benefits their development and reduces online risks by encouraging \nvaluable and valued activities. \nGreater internet use is associated with higher levels of education, so educational achievement \nmay be expected to increase the extent and sophistication of internet use. Further, gaps in ICT \nprovision and insufficient\/ outdated provision of ICT in schools should be addressed, and media \neducation should be recognised and resourced as a core element of school curricula and \ninfrastructure. \nPolicy recommendations \u2013 minimising risks \nThere are good grounds to strengthen regulatory frameworks across Europe, especially in some \ncountries, since substantial proportions of children are encountering content, contact and conduct \nrisks, and since many children and parents lack the tools and skills by which they can prevent or \nmanage such exposure.  Self-regulatory provision in improving children\u2019s safety online is to be \nwelcomed and supported, although it is not always transparent or independently evaluated. \nChildren can only be supported in managing the online environment if this is substantially regulated \n- by law enforcement, interface and website design, search processes, content and service \nproviders, online safety resources, etc \u2013 just as they can only be taught to cross a road on which \ndrivers and driving are carefully regulated. \nPriorities for future awareness-raising should concentrate on countries identified by research \nas high risk (Estonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, the UK); on countries which have \nrapidly and recently adopted the internet, where access appears to exceed skills and cultural \nadjustment (Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Poland, Portugal); and on countries where children\u2019s use \nexceeds parents\u2019 use (Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania).  Awareness-raising priorities should \nfocus on younger children; on strategies to encourage coping after exposure to risk; on addressing \ngirls and boys differently; and on targeting less privileged families, schools and neighbourhoods. \nAwareness-raising should encompass new risks as these emerge, especially on mobile platforms \nand via peer-to-peer content and services. \nPolicy must move beyond the division between child victims and adult perpetrators. Some \nchildren perpetrate online risks, whether from malice, playfulness or mere accident; those who tend \nto experience online risks may generate further risks; those who create risks may also be victims; \nand those who are vulnerable online may lack adequate social support offline.  Although no-one \ndoubts that parents are responsible for their children\u2019s safety, evidence suggests that they should \nnot be relied upon as many are unaware or unable to mediate their children\u2019s online activities. \nRules and restrictions do not fit well with the ethos of modern parenting, especially in some \ncountries, and it is unclear that parental strategies are effective in reducing children\u2019s exposure to \nrisk or increasing their resilience to cope. \nGiven the growing impetus behind media literacy initiatives, it is timely to evaluate their \neffectiveness in increasing children\u2019s critical knowledge of the online environment. The changing \ndemands of a complex technological, commercial and, increasingly, user-generated environment \nsets limits on children\u2019s media literacy. Hence the importance of co-and self-regulation to support \nchildren\u2019s media literacy. \nResearch recommendations \nThere are some significant gaps in the evidence base. Research priorities include: \n\u0083 younger children, especially in relation to risk and coping, though continually updated \nresearch on teenagers is also important; \n\u0083 emerging contents (especially \u2018web 2.0\u2019) and services (especially if accessed via mobile, \ngaming or other platforms); \n\u0083 understanding children\u2019s developing skills of navigation and search, content interpretation \nand critical evaluation; \n 3\n\u0083 new and challenging risks, such as self-harm, suicide, pro-anorexia, drugs, hate\/racism, \ngambling, addiction, illegal downloading, and commercial risks (sponsorship, embedded or \nviral marketing, use of personal data, GPS tracking); \n\u0083 how children (and parents) do and should respond to online risk; \n\u0083 how to identify particularly vulnerable or \u2018at risk\u2019 children within the general population; \n\u0083 evaluations of the effectiveness of technical solutions, parental mediation, media literacy, \nother awareness and safety measures, both in terms of the ease of implementation and \nmore importantly in terms of their impact on risk reduction; this may vary for different groups \nof children in different cultural contexts. \nTo advance this agenda, and since methods of researching children, the online environment, and \ncountries in comparative perspective are all demanding, EU Kids Online produced two reports on \nmethodology - a literature review and a best practice research guide, plus additional online \nresources to guide researchers. All are available at www.eukidsonline.net, along with project \nreports and further publications. \n \nEU Kids Online II: \nEnhancing knowledge regarding European children\u2019s use, risk and safety online \n \nEU Kids Online II is a new project funded by the EC Safer Internet Programme, designed to \nexamine children\u2019s and parents\u2019 experiences and practices regarding use, risk and safety online.  \nThis is the second project undertaken by the EU Kids Online network, comprising some 70 experts \nin social uses of the internet and new media, media education and digital literacy, childhood and \nfamily studies, the psychology of adolescence and identity, legal and regulatory perspectives, and \nresearch methods. \nBetween 2009 and 2011, EU Kids Online II will conduct original empirical research across \nmember states with national samples of children aged 9-16 years old and their parents. The aim is \nto produce a rigorous, cross-nationally comparative quantitative evidence base regarding internet \nuse across Europe.  Directed by Professor Sonia Livingstone of the London School of Economics \nand Political Science, the project team includes a multinational management group, an international \nadvisory panel, and research teams in over 20 participating countries across Europe. \nWhy is this research needed? \nEU Kids Online I (2006-9) examined available findings on cultural, contextual and risk issues in \nchildren's use of online technologies across 21 countries. It located and evaluated findings from \n400+ studies, identifying key findings and pinpointing gaps in the evidence base. Its reports \nexamine data availability, comparative findings, best research practice, research contexts and \npolicy recommendations. \nOnline risks high on public, research and policy agendas include exposure to inappropriate \ncontent (e.g. pornographic, self-harm and violent content, racist\/hate material), unwelcome contact \n(e.g. grooming, sexual harassment, bullying, abuse of personal information and privacy) and, \nattracting growing attention, inappropriate conduct by children themselves (e.g. bullying, abuse of \nprivacy). \nBut exactly how common these risks are, how much risks result in genuine harm, how children \nreact, whether some children are particularly vulnerable, how parents can or should act \u2013 all these \nquestions and more await cross-nationally comparative and reliable research for their answers. \nFurthermore, it is important to avoid moral panics or exaggerated anxieties, particularly as these \nmay result in efforts to constrain children\u2019s freedoms or limit their opportunities online. \n 4\nAdopting an approach which is child-centred, comparative, critical and contextual, EU Kids \nOnline II aims to design, conduct and analyse a major quantitative survey of children\u2019s experiences \nof online risk. The survey will encompass questions about children\u2019s internet use, digital literacy, \ncoping responses, perceptions and safety practices. These findings will be systematically compared \nto the perceptions and practices of their parents. \nSpecific objectives are as follows: \n\u00be To design a thorough and robust survey instrument appropriate for identifying the nature of \nchildren\u2019s online access, use, risk, coping and safety awareness. \n\u00be To design a thorough and robust survey instrument appropriate for identifying the nature of \nparental experiences, practices and concerns regarding their children\u2019s internet use. \n\u00be To administer the survey in a reliable and ethically-sensitive manner to national samples of \ninternet users aged 9-16, and their parents, in member states. \n\u00be To analyse the results systematically so as to identify both core findings and more complex \npatterns among findings on a national and comparative basis. \n\u00be To disseminate the findings in a timely manner to a wide range of relevant stakeholders \nnationally, across Europe, and internationally. \n\u00be To identify and disseminate key recommendations relevant to the development of safety \nawareness initiatives in Europe. \n\u00be To identify any remaining knowledge gaps and methodological lessons learned, to inform future \nprojects regarding the promotion of safer use of the internet and new online technologies. \n \nExpected results \n\u00be Core findings regarding children\u2019s and parents\u2019 experiences of online technologies, focused on \ncomparisons of children\u2019s and parents\u2019 perceptions of and practices regarding online risk and \nsafety. \n\u00be Patterns of risk and safety online to be identified following top-down hypothesis testing and \nbottom-up exploration of relationships among different variables, conducted on a cross-national \nbasis. \n\u00be Evidence-based policy and research recommendations. \nTimetable \nAutumn 2009 Project planning, survey design, sampling \nSpring 2010 Fieldwork \nSummer 2010 Core data analysis \nAutumn 2010 Report on core findings \nSpring 2011 Contextual and comparative analysis \nSummer 2011 Final report and recommendations \nFurther information \nFor all project reports and outputs, for network contacts and for further information, see \nwww.eukidsonline.net.  \nReports from EU Kids online include the following: \n 5\nStaksrud, E., Livingstone, S. and Haddon, L.
