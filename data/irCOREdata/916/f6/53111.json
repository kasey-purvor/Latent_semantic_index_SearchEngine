Introduction\n[2] Water mass properties in the Antarctic Circumpolar\nCurrent (ACC) are observed to be concentrated in multiple\nfronts [e.g., Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009]. These fronts are\noften collocated with strong zonal jets, similar to examples\nin other geophysical contexts [see Baldwin et al., 2007, and\nreferences therein], including the Earth\u2019s atmospheric jet\nstream and multiple jets in large planetary atmospheres. In\nall of these examples, the formation of fronts and jets arises\nfrom interaction between eddies and mean flow and implies\na strong spatial variation of eddy transports. In the ACC\neddy transport plays a major role in the dynamics of the\nSouthern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (MOC),\nwhich influences water mass formation, meridional heat\ntransport and carbon dioxide uptake. Variations in eddy\ntransport thus have important implications for the MOC and\nhence the global climate system.\n[3] Potential vorticity (PV) is widely accepted as a valu-\nable dynamical diagnostic in a large class of geophysical\nflows. In the ocean PV is materially conserved along iso-\npycnals in the absence of frictional processes or diapycnal\nmixing, which are generally weak in the interior of the ACC.\nPV distributions, as that of any materially conserved scalar,\ntherefore encodes important information about eddy trans-\nport. In other applications, such as transport of stratospheric\nchemical species [Sparling, 2000], probability density\nfunctions (PDFs) have been used as an effective means of\ndescribing spatial variations and identifying important fea-\ntures. Indeed, Marshall et al. [1993] used PDFs to demon-\nstrate PV homogenization in a simple dynamical model of\nthe ACC and with a coarse resolution hydrographic data set.\n[4] A feature of the Southern Ocean that distinguishes it\nfrom the atmosphere is the fronts\u2019 strong departure from\nzonal symmetry. Sokolov and Rintoul [2007, 2009] used\nsatellite altimetry to identify as many as twelve ACC fronts\nthat undergo persistent merger and divergence events and\nmodulations in intensity along the path of the ACC.\nShuckburgh et al. [2009] used velocity fields derived from\nsatellite altimetry to advect a passive tracer and calculate an\neffective diffusivity [Nakamura, 1996] over local \u201cpatches\u201d\nof the ACC. Effective diffusivity profiles differed between\npatches providing evidence for mixing variations along the\npath of the ACC. This paper goes beyond these previous\nstudies by analyzing, using PDFs of PV, the ACC\u2019s multiple\nfront structure, as manifested in subsurface PV distributions,\nand by identifying sharp zonal transitions. By summarizing\nlarge amounts of data efficiently, PDFs of PV can provide\nan excellent tool for detecting both horizontal and vertical\ntransitions in front structure and for indicating key regions\nthat have a dynamical influence on the MOC.\n2. Data and Methods\n[5] The temporal and spatial distribution of PV, q =\nr\u22121(f + z)\u2202s2\/\u2202z, is calculated using numerical output from\nthe 1\/10 degree OFES primitive equation model (Ocean\nGeneral Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator)\n[Masumoto et al., 2004] and interpolated onto isopycnal\nsurfaces. Here f is the Coriolis frequency, z = uy \u2212 vx is\nrelative vorticity, s2 is potential density referenced to 2000 m\n(units of kg m\u22123 understood) and r is in situ density. OfES\nincludes 54 vertical levels with a realistic bathymetry. The\nmodel has high spatial and temporal resolution and solves a\ndynamically consistent set of equations relevant to the\nSouthern Ocean. Our approach is to regard this as a useful\nsurrogate for the real Southern Ocean. In fact, the PV dis-\ntributions extracted from OfES are broadly similar to those\ngenerated from the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE)\nmodel [Mazloff et al., 2010], which has a coarser resolution\n(1\/6 degree), but includes data assimilation.\n[6] Construction of a reliable PDF requires a sufficiently\nlarge number of data points. Our approach is to use a single\nsnapshot of the PV field, but calculate PDFs from a sam-\n1Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics,\nUniversity of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.\n2National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool, UK.\n3School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of\nHawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/10\/2010GL045386\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 37, L23602, doi:10.1029\/2010GL045386, 2010\nL23602 1 of 5\npling region with finite zonal width. Choosing this width as\n10\u00b0 was found to be large enough to give robust PDFs and\nsmall enough to show significant zonal variation. The\nsampling regions span 65\u00b0S to 40\u00b0S and were further\nrequired to contain at least 2000 grid points. Temporal\nvariability is discussed below.\n3. Results\n[7] Figure 1a shows a typical snapshot of PV on the s2 =\n36.74 potential density surface with land masses and fluid at\na depth less than 100 m colored white. The PV distribution\nis dominated by a large\u2010scale gradient, but mesoscale eddies\ngive rise to regions of sharper and weaker PV gradients. A\nregion of particularly well\u2010defined fronts is found down-\nstream of the Campbell Plateau (CP) between 180\u00b0W and\n140\u00b0W (Figures 1b and 1c). Figure 1d displays a PDF of PV\nover the region in Figure 1c, normalized by the mean PV in\nthis region; the non\u2010linear color scale in Figures 1a and 1c is\nmapped to the abscissa. PV is found in four distinct pools\n(PDF maxima) separated by three fronts (PDF minima). At\ngreater depths the influence of topography becomes stron-\nger, as shown by a snapshot of PV along the s2 = 37.10\npotential density surface (Figure 1e). Here topographic\nobstacles may shield and isolate regions of the ACC, which\ninduce significant regional variability in the meridional PV\ngradient. Indeed, reversals in the sign of the large\u2010scale PV\ngradient occur at 30\u00b0E, 80\u00b0E, 120\u00b0W, and 60\u00b0W. As linear\ninstability properties of the ACC depend on the vertical\nstructure of meridional PV gradient [Smith and Marshall,\n2009], variations in this gradient will have important\nimplications for regional differences in eddy characteristics\nalong the path of the ACC.\n[8] In Figure 1d, a line plot PDF of PV is calculated over\na sampling region on an isopycnal surface. By slowly\nchanging the mean longitude\/isopycnal of the window (now\nusing a 10\u00b0 zonal extent), horizontal\/vertical variations in the\nfront structure can be identified. Figure 2 shows the accu-\nmulation of PDF line plots on the s2 = 36.36 (Figure 2a),\ns2 = 36.74 (Figure 2b) and s2 = 37.10 (Figure 2c) density\nsurfaces as the sampling region is shifted along the path of\nthe ACC. Warm colors indicate high probability of the\ncorresponding PV value on the ordinate; the thin black\ncurves mark local maxima of the individual PDFs (cf.\nFigure 1.

Again,\nwarm colors indicate PDF maxima, corresponding to regions\nof homogenized PV. Major topographical features are\nmarked along the top of Figure 2a for reference.\n[9] PV front structure varies significantly both along the\npath of the ACC and in the vertical. In particular, Figure 2a\nshows distinct partitioning of PV along the s2 = 36.36\nisopycnal. Immediately downstream of Kerguelen Island\n(KI, 70\u00b0E) PV has a largely uniform value around 10 \u00d7\n10\u221211 m\u22121 s\u22121, which may be related to mixing occurring\nFigure 2.

The PDFs are normalized by the mean PV in each window (see\ntext for full discussion). The thin black lines mark local maxima of the individual PDFs. The full vertical extent of the PDFs\nalong the white dashed lines is (d) 140\u00b0E and (e) 160\u00b0W.

Number of distinct homogenized pools of potential vorticity (PV) as a function of longitude and potential den-\nsity surface. Distinct PV pools are determined by the number of local maxima in a probability density function (PDF) of PV\non a given isopycnal surface spanning 10\u00b0 longitude and 25\u00b0 latitude. Large values are indicative of multiple fronts. Markers\nshowing the position of key topographical features are defined in the caption of Figure 1.\nTHOMPSON ET AL.: RAPID SOUTHERN OCEAN FRONT TRANSITIONS L23602L23602\n3 of 5\nover and around this large topographic obstacle. Further\ndownstream in the Indian Sector, three to four distinct fronts\noccur that are associated with the northern flank of the ACC\nand a zonally\u2010oriented ridge south of Australia. On this\nshallow isopycnal, PV is largely uniform over the Pacific\nsector of the ACC, consistent with PV homogenization in\nthe South Pacific gyre circulation [Marshall et al., 1993]. A\nrapid change in the outcropping latitude of this isopycnal\nthrough Drake Passage (DP) contributes to the step\u2010like\ntransition in PV near 60\u00b0W. Multiple fronts found south of\nCape Agulhas (CA, 20\u00b0E) reflect contributions from the\ncore of the ACC as well as from the Agulhas retroflection.\nAlong the s2 = 36.74 isopycnal (Figure 2b), multiple dis-\ntinct PV pools are found in the Pacific sector, particularly\nabove the abyssal plains downstream of the Udintsev\nFracture Zone (UFZ, 145\u00b0W). On this particular isopycnal\nthe signature of multiple fronts is much weaker downstream\nof KI. PV structure along s2 = 37.10 (Figure 2c) is strongly\nconstrained by topography as suggested by Figure 1e. Iso-\nlated patches of PV can lead to abrupt changes in the\nmeridional PV distribution, e.g., the low PV values near\n100\u00b0E and the large PV values near 90\u00b0W.\n[10] Vertical transitions in PV structure also exhibit\nregional differences. In the Indian sector (Figure 2d), distinct\nPV pools are found within the density class 36.1 < s2 < 36.5,\nassociated with the northern boundary of the ACC. These\ncollapse to nearly uniform PV along the s2 = 36.6 isopycnal\nsurface, which is reflected in a weak PV gradient on this\nisopycnal. Distinct pools of homogenized PV are then found\nat deeper isopycnals. In the Pacific sector (Figure 2e), PV is\nlargely homogeneous on isopycnals where s2 < 36.5, as\ndiscussed above. On deeper isopycnals, three to four distinct\nPV pools are found as indicated by the black dots.\n[11] The particular isopycnals and longitudes displayed in\nFigure 2 are representative of the different horizontal and\nvertical variability apparent in the PV structure. However,\nthese individual \u201crunning\u201d PDFs do not provide a compre-\nhensive view of PV front characteristics. In Figure 3 the\ninformation from the PDFs is collapsed into a single plot by\ncalculating the number of independent maxima from each of\nthe windowed PV PDFs, e.g., the black curves and black\ndots in Figure 2. A relatively crude method is employed to\ncount the maxima: to qualify, a local maxima must be a\nthreshold value greater than both neighboring local minima.\nFigure 3 uses a threshold value of 0.0025, although the\nqualitative pattern that emerges is largely insensitive to the\nthreshold value. Thus Figure 3 shows the number of\nmaxima, or distinct pools of PV, as a function of longitude\nand isopycnal surface (PDFs are still calculated using a 10\u00b0\nzonal extent).\n[12] Figure 3 shows clear transitions in front structure at\nthe major topographical obstructions KI, CP and DP.\nInterpretation of this plot requires care because, as seen in\nFigure 1, isopycnal surfaces may span a large depth range\nacross the ACC, and different density classes may be found\nin the core of the ACC in different locations. PV on shallow\nisopycnals on the northern flank of the ACC appears to be\nhomogenized throughout much of the Southern Ocean with\nthe exception of the region downstream of KI. The iso-\npycnal surface s2 = 36.50 appears here as a surface of\nuniformly small number of peaks, and is the lower boundary\nof the shallow homogenized PV region in the Pacific sector.\nIn the Indian sector of the ACC (\u223c120\u00b0E), multiple fronts\nare found in two different density classes, reflecting front\nformation on both flanks of the ACC, whereas in the\nPacific sector (\u223c120\u00b0W) there is only a single density class\nexhibiting multiple fronts. There is some evidence of mul-\ntiple fronts in two density classes in the Atlantic sector,\nhowever the transition is found at shallower isopycnals than\nin the Indian sector. The major topographical features are\nalso associated with a reduction in the number of fronts near\nor just downstream of the obstruction.\n[13] Temporal variability of the PDFs of PV is, to a\ndegree, spatially dependent. Front structure associated with\ntopographically\u2010constrained jets is largely stationary, as in\nFigure 4a, which shows the time evolution of the PV PDF\ncorresponding to the region in Figure 1c. On the same iso-\npycnal (s2 = 36.74) in the eastern Pacific sector, where\ntopography is relatively flat, the amplitude and location of\nthe PDF maxima are more variable (Figure 4b), which may\narise from either forcing variability or internal variability.\nStill, the number of distinct PV fronts remains largely\nconstant over this period. This, then, supports the assertion\nthat snapshots, like Figure 3, provide a useful representation\nof the longer term front structure, certainly on time scales of\nmany months.\n4. Discussion\n[14] Complicated eddy processes in the ACC influence\nglobal climate through their effect on the MOC and are\nmanifest in a complex structure of jets and fronts. Here we\nhave resolved the spatial (and to an extent temporal) vari-\nability of the ACC\u2019s front structure by employing a novel\nFigure 4. Two year evolutions of PV PDFs over the regions (a) 180\u00b0W to 140\u00b0W (Figure 1c) and (b) 120\u00b0W to 80\u00b0W on\nthe s2 = 36.74 isopycnal.\nTHOMPSON ET AL.: RAPID SOUTHERN OCEAN FRONT TRANSITIONS L23602L23602\n4 of 5\ndiagnostic, calculating PDFs of PV on isopycnals, applied to\na high resolution ocean GCM. The results show that PV\nfronts form in specific regions of the ACC and on specific\ndensity classes. Rapid alongstream transitions between these\nregions are detected for the first time. The significant ver-\ntical and alongstream variability of the front structure is\nconsistent with the spatially\u2010dependent mixing described by\nShuckburgh et al. [2009] and Abernathy et al. [2010], but\nhere identification of sharp changes in front structure point\nto regions that are likely to exert dynamical control over the\nMOC and merit further study.\n[15] PDFs are an efficient means of analyzing a large\namount of complicated data. Because of this, it can be dif-\nficult to determine with certainty the physical processes\nresponsible for the observed transitions in front structure.\nStill, the correlation between front transitions and topo-\ngraphical features is remarkable. Topography acts to both\nsteer mean flows and modify PV gradients, and these\nchanges may feed back on eddy generation through baro-\ntropic and baroclinic instabilities [Thompson, 2010], leading\nto enhanced mixing. Figure 3 shows evidence of these local\ndynamical processes as immediately downstream of the\nmajor topographical constrictions KI, CP and DP there is a\nfull\u2010depth reduction in the number of homogenized pools of\nPV. We note that topographical features also tend to be sites\nof internal wave generation that can enhance diapycnal\nmixing and modify interior PV. It is not well known at\npresent how vertical mixing impacts front structure. Finally,\ntopography may also alter PV distributions through mod-\nifications in stratification related to rapid changes in iso-\npycnals that outcrop or in outcrop locations; this is\nespecially evident across Drake Passage (Figures 2 and 3).\nBesides being a key sink of momentum input by surface\nwinds, these results indicate that topography also (i) acts as a\ncatalyst for local re\u2010organization of water mass structure and\n(ii) isolates regions of the deep ACC, which affects large\u2010\nscale PV gradients.\n[16] This study begins to link the work of Shuckburgh\net al. [2009] and Abernathy et al. [2010] with Sokolov\nand Rintoul [2007, 2009]. Multiple jets are found through-\nout the ACC, but the effectiveness of these jets acting as\nbarriers to transport (i.e., to separate distinct water masses)\nlikely varies along the path of the ACC. Specifically, this\nstudy highlights the need to further study the dynamical\nrelationship between fronts and velocity jets in the ACC,\nincluding the link between surface fronts and interior PV\ndistributions. Indeed, although Sokolov and Rintoul [2009]\nidentify many circumpolar fronts from altimetry data,\nShuckburgh et al. [2009] discover a much smaller number of\nlow mixing regions in certain parts of the ACC using the\nsame data set. This study also indicates that changes in\ntransport properties may occur rapidly and may depend on\nlocal dynamics, such as constraints on the flow past\ntopography. This suggests that local dynamics impact global\nproperties of the Southern Ocean and its MOC, and care must\nbe taken in the interpretation of regional observations or of\nzonally\u2010averaged theories of Southern Ocean circulation.\n[17] The most striking result of this study is the strong\nzonal variation and the dominant control of topography over\nthe ACC\u2019s multiple front structure. This behavior motivates\na possible model of the ACC that is comprised of zonally\u2010\nuniform regions separated by sharp transitions. The physical\nprocesses that govern the rapid re\u2010organization of the front\nstructure at these topographical transition zones is the focus\nof on\u2010going research.\n[18] Acknowledgments.
