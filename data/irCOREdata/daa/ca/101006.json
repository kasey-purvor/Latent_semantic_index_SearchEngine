INTRODUCTION\nMolecular motors are nanometer-sized functional biomo-\nlecular structures that consume energy to induce motion and\nto generate forces. Their dynamics is highly nonlinear and\ncovers various time and length scales. Nature offers a large\nvariety of different motor families characterized by a particu-\nlar chemical structure, an environment, and a specific way of\ncontrolled \u0001linear or rotary\u0002 motion. In the human body mo-\ntor proteins control many essential processes such as cell\ndivision, transmembrane transport of ions and macromol-\necules, intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles, syn-\nthesis of ATP or DNA, muscle movement, or functioning of\ncells. Consumption of energy then leads to controlled trans-\nlational \u0001e.g., kinesin, myosin\u0002 or rotary motion of these mo-\nlecular structures. Examples of rotary motors are the bacte-\nrial flagellar motor that rotates a flagellum using proton flow\nthrough the motor as the energy source and the F0F1-ATP\nsynthase, which comprises two rotary motors, one driven by\nproton flow \u0001F0 motor\u0002 and the other by ATP hydrolysis \u0001F1\nmotor\u0002 \u00031,2\u0004. Rotational motors play a key role in many bio-\nlogical membranes \u00033,4\u0004. Additionally, due to their promising\ncharacteristics of working extremely efficiently and being\ncontrollable, artificial nanomotors can be conceived that di-\nrectly employ the fundamental principals of biological mo-\ntors \u00035\u0004: The orientation of micrometer-sized particles could\nbe driven and controlled by light \u00036,7\u0004. Macroscopic mag-\nnetic disks \u0001on a water surface\u0002 could be forced by a magnet\nto rotational motion \u00038\u0004. Similarly, ATP-synthase could be\nused as a propeller inducing rotational motion in artifical\nmachinery. This will open the way to novel micro- and nano-\ntechnical devices such as particle separators or machines in-\ntermingling fluids that are based on and use the principles\nand mechanisms of these microscopic engines.\nA main difference between biological and biotechnologi-\ncal rotary motor complexes lies in their size: Typical motor\ndensities in the chloroplasts of plants or in the mitochondriea\nof human cells are 1000 ATP-synthase motors per \u0003m2 \u00039\u0004.\nIn contrast, artificial rotary motor complexes may be com-\nposed of larger particles, e.g., millimeter-sized magnetic\ndisks on a water surface \u000310\u0004. However, there are many char-\nacteristics that both types of systems have in common but it\nis, in particular, the dynamic coupling of spatially inhomo-\ngeneous motor ensembles and an environmental fluid that\ndetermines their overall behavior \u0001e.g., assembly of cells or\nmacroscopic particles\u0002. The complex behavior of natural bio-\nmolecular and novel biotechnological systems thus repre-\nsents a formidable challenge for theoretical descriptions and\nnumerical approaches that aim at a fundamental analysis of\nthe underlying interaction mechanisms as well as interpreta-\ntions or even control of a system\u2019s behavior.\nIn this paper we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics\nof rotary motors interacting with an environmental fluid. Our\ntheory is based on a mesoscopic, spatiotemporally resolved\napproach that bridges theoretical descriptions of microscopic\nbiochemical properties of biological media with macroscopic\nsystem theories. The model takes into account, in particular,\nthe various time and length scales and the full complexity of\nthe interplay of spatial with temporal degrees of freedom. A\nspace-dependent parameter set allows for a very general in-\nclusion of molecular properties, particle distributions, and\nfluctuations. We use a classical approach for the rotating mo-\ntor ensemble and couple their dynamics self-consistently\nwith spatially and temporally resolved Navier-Stokes equa-\ntions for the simulation of the fluid dynamics. The explicit\nconsideration of the spatial dependence of the quantities rep-\nresents an extension of spatially averaged studies based on\nthe Navier-Stokes equations. Our spatially and temporally\nresolved integration of the Navier-Stokes equation thereby\nleads to a very natural and automatic inclusion of each\nmotor-motor interaction.\nIn the following, we will describe and simulate the spa-\ntiotemporal dynamics of rotors embedded in a hydrodynamic\nfluid. The theory and modeling will include, in particular, the\nhydrodynamic motion in the fluid induced by the spatially\ndistributed rotating motors as well as the influence of the*Electronic address: e.gehrig@surrey.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 73, 051916 \u00012006\u0002\n1539-3755\/2006\/73\u00015\u0002\/051916\u00018\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society051916-1\nflow dynamics on the rotation and spatial distribution of the\nmotor ensemble.\nII. THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION\nWe consider the situation displayed in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002. Rotary\nmotors with individual positions, rotation frequencies, and\nlocally varying coupling to the environment are spatially dis-\ntributed within an embedding fluent medium. The rotation of\nthe rotors generates a characteristic velocity field v\u0001r , t\u0002 in\ntheir environment. Thereby, the dynamics of each motor\ninfluences\u2014via the mutual coupling of motors and the em-\nbedding fluent medium\u2014the motion of the other motors. In\nthe following we will derive a spatially and temporally re-\nsolved approach that includes the spatiotemporal dynamics\nof motors and their environment on a mesoscopic scale. The\ntheory is based on the Navier-Stokes equations \u0001for the simu-\nlation of the fluent medium\u0002 \u00039\u0004 that are dynamically coupled\nto a spatially inhomogeneous rotating motor ensemble. In\nprinciple, the motors may be driven by, e.g., a chemical re-\naction or an external force. Without loss of generality we will\nin the following refer to a motor ensemble that is driven by\nan external excitation. Thereby we focus our study on a clas-\nsical rotation of monopolar particles \u0001approximated by\nspheres\u0002, i.e., we neglect that the rotation \u0001as in many bio-\nlogical motors\u0002 might occur in a stepwise motion. Further-\nmore, we do not consider dipolar motors \u0001as, e.g., the ATP\nsynthase\u0002. Our model system thus refers more to artificial\nmotors that can be described by monopoles driven by an\nexternal field while biological macromolecules are driven by\ninternally generated forces and correspond to rotational di-\npoles \u0001as explained in, e.g., \u000311\u0004\u0002. The \u0001rotational and trans-\nlational\u0002 dynamics of these motors is then determined by the\nangular frequency applied to each motor and the velocity\ndistribution in the environmental fluid. The dynamics of the\nfluid, on the other hand, is strongly influenced by the rotation\nof the spatially distributed motors. We consider \u0001without loss\nof generality\u0002 a system of classical, spherical particles of\nradius R rotating with a uniform rotation. We note that an\nextension of the model description to a motor ensemble with\na stepwise rotation or angle-dependent fluctuations \u0001as, e.g.,\nin the biological rotary motor F1-ADP synthase \u00034\u0004\u0002 is\nstraightforward. The motor distribution is given by \u0004m\u0001r , t\u0002\nwhere \u0004m\u0001r , t\u0002=\u0004m\n0 \u0001r , t\u0002 when a motor is located at position r\nin the biological medium and zero elsewhere. The motors are\nembedded in a Newtonian fluid characterized by the viscos-\nity \u0005 and density \u0004 fl. The dynamics of the velocity field\nv\u0001r , t\u0002 in the flow medium can be described by the following\nNavier-Stokes equations:\n\u0004 fl\n\u0001\n\u0001t\nv\u0001r,r\u0002 + \u0004 fl\u0003v\u0001r,t\u0002 \u00b7 \u0002\u0004v\u0001r,t\u0002 \u2212 \u0005\u00022v\u0001r,t\u0002 = 0. \u00011\u0002\nThereby we have disregarded the pressure tensor \u0001no tem-\nperature gradient\u0002. A very convenient approach for a descrip-\ntion of the influence of a motor rotation on a fluent is to\nneglect in Eq. \u00011\u0002 the terms that depend on the density of the\nenvironment \u0001i.e., restricting oneself to systems with small\nReynolds numbers\u0002. This assumption then leads to the Stokes\nequation with solution v=R3 \/r3\u0006\u0007r \u000312\u0004. Aiming at a de-\nscription of the full spatiotemporal dynamics of spatially in-\nhomogeneous motor\u2013fluent medium complexes we here ex-\nplicitly consider the full spatial and temporal dependence of\nthe physical quantities and numerically integrate Eq. \u00011\u0002\u2014\nwithout further approximations\u2014in space and time. The con-\nsideration of the full spatial dependence of the variables\nthereby self-consistently describes the motor rotation by di-\nrectly transferring the velocity field \u0001induced at the rim of the\nrotor spheres by the motor rotation\u0002 to the medium. The ve-\nlocity distribution in the immediate environment of grid\npoints occupied by motors \u0003shaded area in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004 is then\ngiven by v=\u0006\u0007r \u0001using the no-slip condition, i.e., assuming\nthat the tangential velocity component is zero at the rotor\nsurface\u0002. The velocity dynamics in the remaining spatial po-\nsitions \u0001at each grid point and for each time step\u0002 is calcu-\nlated using Eq. \u00011\u0002. At every grid point and for each time\nstep, the velocity field v is calculated on the basis of finite\ndifference methods \u0001on a numerical grid with regular mesh\nsize\u0002 using the hopscotch \u000313\u0004 method as a general scheme.\nThe coupling between the rotors and fluent medium and,\nparticularly, the gradual transfer of the rotation to the envi-\nronment happens due to the dynamic coupling between\nneighboring fluent layers. This is automatically included via\nthe spatial dependence of Eq. \u00011\u0002. Due to our explicit con-\nsideration of the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom\nwithin the molecular ensemble we only need to take into\naccount\u2014at each spatial point r= \u0001x ,y\u0002\u2014the coupling of the\nvelocity field to the immediate neighboring elements of the\nnumerical grid, i.e., at \u0001x\u00b1\bx ,y\u00b1\by\u0002 \u0001where \bx and \by de-\nnote the length and width of a numerical element, respec-\ntively\u0002. This \u201clocal\u201d interaction is directly realized via the\nspatial derivatives in Eq. \u00011\u0002. The influence of the rotation of\na motor on the environment and\u2014via the motor-fluent-\nmedium coupling\u2014to the dynamics of the neighboring mo-\ntors is thus automatically included.\nIn principle, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the velocity\nfield may change the position of the spatially distributed mo-\ntors.

As a conse-\nquence, the distribution of the rotary motors has to be recal-\nculated after each time step. In a final step, we thus include a\npossible change in motor positions induced by the dynami-\ncally varying velocity distribution. In general, the motors\nfollow the local flow leading to dynamic positions of a new\nquasiequilibrium distribution. The new motor positions can\nthus be calculated by integrating Eq. \u00011\u0002 in space. In particu-\nlar, this reorganization automatically includes the hydrody-\nnamic repulsion between neighboring motors \u0001as a direct\nconsequence of inertial forces \u000310\u0004\u0002 via their interaction in\nthe embedding medium. The direct numerical integration of\nthe partial differential equations of motion \u00011\u0002 allows a very\ngeneral and straightforward representation of spatial inhomo-\ngeneities and nonequilibrium dynamics of the motor\u2013fluent-\nmedium system.\nIn the following, we will present selective results of our\ncomputational modeling based on this description. Without\nloss of generality, we will concentrate on motors character-\nized by a uniform \u0001classical\u0002 rotation. We would like to note,\nhowever, that the integration of a stepwise rotation that often\nexists in biological motors \u0001e.g., F1ATPase\u0002 is straightfor-\nward. Similarly, the theory can be extended to include bio-\nlogical motor complexes consisting of two rotors. In this\ncase the velocity changes induced by the motors can be de-\nscribed by force centers at the edges of the motor complex\n\u000311\u0004 and the thickness of the membrane surrounding the mo-\ntors has to be explicitly taken into account \u000312\u0004.\nIII. SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS\nOF A TWIN-MOTOR SYSTEM\nIn the following we will first concentrate on the dynamics\nof a twin-motor system \u0001Fig. 2\u0002. The motors are immersed\nin a fluid of viscosity \u0005, uniform density \u0004 fl, and kinematic\nviscosity \t=\u0005 \/\u0004 fl. The Reynolds number of the spinning\nspheres can be defined as Re=\u0006R2 \/\t. For the sizes used\nin our simulation \u0001R=400 \u0003m\u0002 and rotation frequencies\n\u0001\u0006=0.5, . . . ,5 s\u22121\u0002\u0002 Re is of the order of 10\u22121\u20131, i.e., inertia\nplays an important role.\nThe two motors rotate with identical rotation vector\n\u0006=5 s\u22121 and radius R=400 \u0003m. They are positioned at a\nspatial separation of D=5 mm witin an aqueous solution\n\u0001\u0005=10\u22123 kg m\u22121 s\u22121; \u0004=103 kg\/m3\u0002. Figure 3 shows snap-\nshots of the motor distribution \u0004m\u0001r , t\u0002 \u0001a\u0002\u2013\u0001c\u0002 and the local\nkinetic energy \nkin\u0001r , t\u0002=1\/2\u0004 flv2\u0001r , t\u0002 \u0001d\u0002\u2013\u0001f\u0002 taken immedi-\nately after the start of the calculation \u0001a\u0002, \u0001d\u0002, and at t=100\n\u0001b\u0002, \u0001e\u0002 and 200 ms \u0001c\u0002, \u0001f\u0002. At the start of the calculation, the\nmotors were aligned parallel to the y axis. The distribution of\n\nkin\u0001r , t\u0002 reveals the dynamics of the energy flow. Note that\nthe abrupt cutoff in the center of the motor positions marks\nthe finite spatial extension of the rotors. Immediately after\nthe start of the calculation, the rotation of the two motors\ninduces a dynamic velocity flow in the environment. Due to\nthe finite rotation frequency and the viscosity of the environ-\nment this velocity field dynamically changes during the first\nrotation \u0001corresponding to 200 ms for a rotation frequency of\n5 s\u22121\u0002 until a quasiequilibrium state is reached. Similarly, the\ndynamic interplay of motor and fluent medium dynamics is\nstill growing in this time window. We would like to note that\nthe suitable design of such a velocity field around a set of\nmotors may also be used to generate a specific flow to gen-\nerate macroscopic motion. In \u000314\u0004 it was shown that F1-\nATPase motors can be integrated in functional nanoelectro-\nmechnanical systems to induce the rotation of\nnanopropellers. The simulation of such systems will be con-\nsidered in future investigations. In the given example the\nmotors are positioned rather close so that each motor expe-\nriences not only the velocity field induced by its own rotation\nbut additionally the spatiotemporal changes in the velocity\nfield induced by its neighboring motor. In the given example\nof two motors with identical rotational frequency, a spatial\narea of destructive interferences arises between the two mo-\ntors. The interaction and mutual coupling thereby depends on\nFIG. 2. Dynamic interaction between two motors: The dotted\nlines and arrows indicate the velocity fields.\nFIG. 3. Temporal snapshot of the spatial mo-\ntor distribution \u0001a\u0002-\u0001c\u0002 and the induced local en-\nergy flow \u0001d\u0002-\u0001f\u0002 in a two-rotor system at t=0 \u0001a\u0002,\n\u0001d\u0002, 100 \u0001b\u0002, \u0001e\u0002 and 200 ms \u0001c\u0002, \u0001f\u0002. The initial\nspatial separation of the motors was D=5 mm,\nthe rotation frequency \u0006=5 s\u22121.\nNONLINEAR DYNAMICS AND SELF-ORGANIZATION OF\u00bc PHYSICAL REVIEW E 73, 051916 \u00012006\u0002\n051916-3\nthe rotation frequencies of the motors as well as on the\nphysical properties of the environmental fluid. This effect\ncan clearly be seen in the distribution of the local energy\n\u0001being proportional to v2\u0002 that dynamically evolves during\nthe rotation of the motors. In the area between the two mo-\ntors destructive interferences arises \u0001Fig. 2\u0002 whereas con-\nstructive interference occurs in spatial regions where \u0005r\u0005\u000bD.\nThe corresponding kinetic energy consequently is smaller if\nD is larger. The snapshots of the velocity and of the local\nenergy distribution taken at 200 ms \u0003Figs. 3\u0001c\u0002 and 3\u0001f\u0002\u0004 shed\nlight on two important effects. First, the motors experience a\nhydrodynamic repulsive force that pushes them apart. This\ntranslational shift directly originates from the dynamic spa-\ntiotemporal overlap of the velocity fields. In our model ex-\nample it is, in particular, inertia that leads to the observed\nshift. Second, the motors may start a rotation around their\ncenter of mass following the energy flow of their environ-\nment. This effect can be understood by looking at the arrows\nindicating the overall velocity field around the motors\nsketched in Fig. 2 or by following the torque of the energy\nflow depicted in Fig. 3\u0001f\u0002. The force pushing the motors apart\nis similar to the Magnus force which is well known from\nBernoulli\u2019s equations in fluid dynamics where it is correlated\nwith the pressure difference arising from a combined trans-\nlational and rotational motion and consequently describes an\ninertial effect. The dissipative motor\u2013fluent medium system\ngiven by our motor complex features an analog inertia effect\nvia the viscosity. In real \u0001viscoelastic\u0002 fluids, additional time\nscales may be present via the microscopic relaxation times of\nthe components in the fluent medium \u000312\u0004. The right-hand\nrotation of the two motors thus leads to a corresponding slow\nright-hand rotation of the motors around their center of mass\n\u0003Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002\u0004. The frequency of this collective rotation and the\nspatial separation of the two motors in the quasistationary\ncase thereby depends on the properties of the fluent as well\nas on the initial separation and rotation frequency of the mo-\ntors. If the motor separation exceeds a critical separation\nand\/or the rotation frequency is too small to induce a signifi-\ncant change in the fluent then the motor interaction may be\ntoo small to induce a spatial drift. The snapshots taken at\nt=100 \u0001a\u0002, \u0001c\u0002 and 200 ms \u0001b\u0002, \u0001d\u0002 of the motor distribution\nand the local energy distribution induced by the two motors\nwith a spatial separation of 1 mm and a rotation frequency of\n\u0006=5 s\u22121 shown in Fig. 4 are an example of such decoupled\ndynamics. With increasing time, a dynamic spatiotemporal\ncoupling of the velocity fields arises leading to a dynamic\noverlap of the energy profiles \u0003Fig. 4\u0001d\u0002; the ellipse marks\nthe small difference between the two time steps\u0004. However,\ndue to the larger separation, the dynamic spatial overlap is\nmuch smaller than in the case of the close motor formation\n\u0001Fig. 3\u0002 and the influence of inertia on the motor dynamics is\ndecreased. The two motors consequently continue their de-\ncoupled rotation without changing their positions. One\nshould note that here we restricted our discussions to selec-\ntive simulation results rather than exploring large parameter\nscans. We would like to note, however, that a large advantage\nof our model lies in the possibility of a systematic variation\nand visualization of the control parameters and the resulting\ndistributions in a given motor system.\nIV. DYNAMIC SELF-ORGANIZATION IN SPATIALLY\nINHOMOGENEOUS MOTOR ENSEMBLES\nOur computational modeling allows the description and\nsimulation of spatially inhomogeneous motor systems. Due\nto the spatially and temporally resolved description we thus\ndo not have to use, e.g., averaged quantities to describe the\ninfluence of the dynamics of the neighboring motors on a\nspecific motor. The spatially and temporally resolved integra-\ntion of the Navier-Stokes equation leads to a very natural and\nautomatic inclusion of each motor-motor interaction. In the\nfollowing discussion we will focus on a multimotor en-\nsemble system embedded in an environmental fluid. Without\nloss of generality, we consider an ensemble consisting of\nN=14 motors. Depending on their spatial positioning and\nrotation frequency the motors may arrange themselves in the\nform of a regular grid, move about in a chaotic way, or\nappear completely decoupled.

Influence of motor coupling\nIn the following we will analyze the fundamentals of the\ninteraction and coupling between neighboring motors. We\nwill focus on the reorganization of strongly interacting mo-\ntors as well as on the influence of rotation frequency and\nspatial separation of the motors. Figure 5 shows snapshots of\nthe motor distribution \u0001a\u0002, \u0001b\u0002 and local energy \u0001c\u0002, \u0001d\u0002 in a\nsystem consisting of N=14 motors \u0001all rotating in the same\ndirection\u0002. Without loss of generality we consider a situation\nwhere the rotation frequency has been set to \u0006=5 s\u22121 and\nviscosity of the fluent to \u0005=10\u22123 kg m\u22121 s\u22121. The first snap-\nshot \u0001a\u0002, \u0001c\u0002 is taken at time t=200 ms after the start of the\ncalculation where the rotating motors have already\u2014due to\ntheir dynamical coupling to their environment\u2014induced a\nsignificant overlap of their velocity fields and resulting en-\nergy distribution \u0003Fig. 5\u0001c\u0002\u0004. The collective behavior of the\nsystem in combination with the rotational motion of the mo-\ntor molecules leads to a complex dynamics: The velocity\nfield induced by each motor leads to a repulsive translational\nforce acting on the neighboring motors. At the same time,\neach motor experiences the velocity field generated by the\nother motors. The dynamics of the motor ensemble conse-\nquently is determined by both the coupling of the motors to\ntheir environment and the physical properties of the fluent.\nThe second snapshot \u0001b\u0002, \u0001d\u0002 is taken at a time point t=2 s\nafter the start of the calculation. In the shown example, the\ndynamic coupling between the rotating motors and their en-\nvironment leads to a reorganization of the motor ensemble\n\u0003Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002\u0004 in a gridlike structure \u0001Wigner crystal\u0002 and to a\ncorresponding minimization of the kinetic energy of the sys-\ntem \u0003Fig. 5\u0001d\u0002\u0004. The formation and stabilization of such a\ngrating is strongly dependent on the coupling of the indi-\nvidual motors. As a consequence, a critical rotation fre-\nquency exists for a given motor arrangement \u00039\u0004. For com-\nparison, Figs. 6 and 7 show two examples that visualize the\ninfluencing factors of the rotation frequency \u0001Fig. 6\u0002 and the\nFIG. 5.

In this case, the\nreduced velocity transferred from the motor rotation to the\nimmediate motor environment leads to a smaller amplitude\nin the energy distribution \u0003the scaling of the z axis is the\nsame as in Figs. 5\u0001c\u0002 and 5\u0001d\u0002\u0004. As a consequence, the\nchanges in the energy distribution are to a larger degree re-\nstricted to the area immediately surrounding the motor posi-\ntions. Only two motors with rather close initial positions\n\u0003marked with a white ellipse in Figs. 6\u0001a\u0002 and 6\u0001b\u0002\u0004 are\nslightly shifted apart while the remaining motors keep their\ninitial positions.\nFor the same rotation frequency \u0001\u0006=1 s\u22121\u0002 Fig. 7 visual-\nizes the influence of the initial spatial distribution. In this\nexample, the motor positions were closer to the center of\nthe rectangular spatial area. As a consequence, an increase\nin coupling strength arises due to the smaller average dis-\ntance between neighboring motors and the motors again\ndrift toward a regular gridlike structure in the second time\nstep \u0003Figs. 7\u0001b\u0002 and 7\u0001d\u0002\u0002. In a given system, the lattice con-\nstant of the resulting grating is a function of initial distribu-\ntion, rotation frequency, and the physical properties of the\nenvironmental fluent.\nB. Influence of spatial inhomogeneity\nThe dynamics of the motor\u2013fluent medium system de-\npends not only on the coupling between the rotating motor\nensemble and the environment but also on spatial inhomoge-\nneities in the motor ensemble or fluent medium properties.\nStatistical fluctuations in the motor positions, rotation fre-\nquencies, or velocities may enhance a diffusive motion,\nthereby representing a counterpart of the reorganizing forces.\nIn real motor systems the properties of the motors and of the\nfluent medium may strongly vary from one spatial point to\nanother. In the following we will show results of simulations\nof a motor ensemble with variable rotation frequency, a spa-\ntially inhomogeneous fluent medium, and the generation of a\nmacroscopic flow by inhomogeneous motor rotation. In the\nfollowing we consider a motor ensemble with a spatially\nvarying motor rotation. In our example we assume a spatial\nfluctuation of 10% \u0001assuming a Gaussian distribution\u0002\naround a central frequency of \u0006=1 s\u22121. Figure 8 shows two\nsnapshots of the local energy distribution, taken at t=200 \u0001a\u0002\nand 2 s \u0001b\u0002, respectively. The amplitude in the environment\nof the motor rims thereby directly reflects the spatially vary-\ning motor rotation that is transferred to the medium. One\nshould note that in this case we have omitted the grid points\ndirectly neighboring the motor positions in order to plot the\ndistribution of the velocity field only \u0001without the velocity\nimmediately at the rim given by the rotation frequencies\u0002.\nThe motor\u2013fluent medium coupling is rather moderate so\nthat no reorganization of the spatial motor distribution oc-\ncurs. However, a partial influence of the velocity distribu-\ntions induced by the individual motors can clearly be seen in\nthe second snapshot: The motors influence each other via\ntheir dynamic interaction with the fluent medium, leading to\na partial influence of the velocity fields in the immediate\nenvironment of the individual motors. As a consequence, the\nFIG. 7.

As an example, Fig. 9 shows\nthe results of a simulation of a motor system with a spatial\nfluctuation in the velocity distribution of 10%. Shown are\nsnapshots of the motors \u0003Figs. 9\u0001a\u0002 and 9\u0001b\u0002\u0004 and the local\nenergy fields \u0003Figs. 9\u0001c\u0002 and 9\u0001d\u0002\u0004 for t=1 \u0001a\u0002, \u0001c\u0002 and 2 s \u0001b\u0002,\n\u0001d\u0002, respectively. Depending on the spatial arrangement and\nthe physical properties of motors and the environment such\nflucutations may induce elongations of the motors from their\nquasiequilibrium and destabilize a given distribution. The\nsnapshots of the motor distribution \u0001\u0006=5 s\u22121\u0002 \u0003for t=1 \u0001a\u0002\nand 2 s \u0001b\u0002\u0004 show that the motors dynamically change their\npositions but do not form a regular grid. The corresponding\ndistributions of the local energy \u0003Figs. 9\u0001c\u0002 and 9\u0001d\u0002\u0004 visual-\nize the fluctuations in the velocity field that lead to the dy-\nnamically changing motor positions. Depending on motor-\nenvironment coupling and on the spatial separation from the\nneighboring motors the motor movements may increase or\ndecrease with increasing time.\nRecent investigations have demonstrated that a nonuni-\nform rotation of motors \u0001e.g., the vortical motion of cilia\n\u000315,16\u0004 or that generated in a diffusive motor ensemble\nby using asymmetric boundaries \u00039\u0004\u0002 may be responsible\nfor left-right asymmetries in the vertebrate body plan. A\nnonuniform rotation may thus represent an interesting\nmethod for the generation of a macroscopic flow. Here we\nconsider as an example a row of motors rotating with fre-\nquency \u0006=\u00060+\f\u0006\u0001\r\u0002 where \u00060 denotes the uniform contri-\nbution and \f\u0006\u0001\r\u0002=0.2 sin\u0001\r\u0002 \u0001\r denotes the angle in the\nplane of the motor ensemble with respect to the motor row\u0002.\nFigure 10 shows a snapshot of the local energy for\n\u0006=0.5 s\u22121 and t=200 ms. The sketch on top of the distribu-\ntion visualizes \u0001for two rotors\u0002 the spatially inhomogeneous\nmotor rotation. The nonuniform rotation introduces a spa-\ntiotemporal inhomogeneity in the system leading to dynamic\n\u0001in the example sine-shaped\u0002 acceleration and deceleration of\nthe motor rotation. As a consequence, the flow fields pointing\nto the left and the right sides of the motor row are of differ-\nent magnitude leading to an overall flow in one direction\n\u0001in our example, to the left side of the row; see sketch in Fig.\n11\u0002. This example clearly demonstrates that an asymmetry\nor even control in a macroscopic flow may be generated\nby a suitable design of artificial motors. This result can\nonly provide a first insight into possible control mechanisms\nor nanomechanical systems based on artificial motors. Future\ninvestigations will include details of the structure and\nmovement of biological motors. This may then contribute to\nthe interpretation of velocity fields in biological motor\nensembles.\nOur simulations on selective motor systems clearly reveal\nthe complex dependence of a spatially inhomogeneous motor\nensemble on rotation frequency, spatial distribution, and\nnoise. The shown results cannot give more than a first indi-\ncation of possible systematic simulations of real molecular\nsystems. However, we would like to note that in particular\nthe spatial and temporal resolution of the model description\nFIG. 9.

In particular, it may pro-\nvide the basis for a fundamental and comparative analysis of\nboth artificial motors driven by external fields and biological\nmotors in a viscoeleastic solvent.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented a spatially resolved Navier-Stokes\nmodel describing the coupled nonlinear dynamics of rotary\nmolecular rotor ensembles within an embedding fluent. Our\nmodel includes, in particular, the coupling of the embedding\nfluid to a spatially inhomogeneous motor ensemble and ex-\ntends exisisting models with respect to the spatial degree of\nfreedom. Our mesoscopic approach is based on spatially re-\nsolved equations of motion describing the fluid dynamics\nand includes, in particular, space-dependent parameters for\nmolecular properties and spatiotemporal noise. Space-time\nsimulations on the basis of this approach reveal fundamental\nyet directly application-relevant results on the spatiotemporal\ndynamics of molecular motor complexes. They visualize a\ncomplex spatio-temporal interplay of motor ensembles and\ntheir environment and allow the fundamental analysis of the\ninfluence of particle distribution, angular frequencies of the\nrotary motion as well as spatiotemporal fluctuations in the\nphysical parameters of the motors or the fluent. The explicit\nconsideration of the spatial dependence allows the study and\nvisualization of the influence of individual parameters and\nmay be of particular importance for the realistic simulation\nof, e.g., a given experimental situation where spatial inhomo-\ngeneities in motor distribution and motor parameters are very\ntypical. In our future investigations we plan to extend the\nmodel description to include the substructure and dynamics\nof complex biological motors such as, e.g., F1-ATPase. In\nparticular, we plan to consider the dipolar character that is\ntypical for many biological motors as well as the chemical\nreactions. This will allow the spatially resolved description\nof experimental observations such as, e.g., the artificial syn-\nthesis of ATP induced by mechanical energy \u000317\u0004 or the step-\nwise rotation in F1-ATPase \u000318\u0004. The simulation of the full\ncomplexity of the spatially varying nonlinear fluent medium\nand motor dynamics may open new ways for fundamental\nanalysis and potential control of collective behavior induced\nby the hydrodynamical interactions. Although we here have\napplied our studies to concrete systems the very general ap-\nproach can, in principle, be applied to many other systems.\nIn particular, the possibility to vary parameters individually\nmay allow the prediction of potential control parameters that\nmay enable an optimized efficient energy conversion and dy-\nnamics control. This may be of importance for both a physi-\ncal understanding of fundamental biological processes in\nnatural rotary motor complexes as well as the transfer into\nnovel biotechnological devices.\n\u00031\u0004 T.
