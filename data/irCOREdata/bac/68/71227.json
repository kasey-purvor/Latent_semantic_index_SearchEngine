Light-controlled switches have a wide variety of poten-\ntial applications in optical communications and high-speed\noptoelectronic systems. Optically controlled, fiber-based\nswitches such as loop mirrors or soliton gates can be very\nfast with good contrast ratios, low-power, and cascadable\nBoolean logic, but they are difficult to arrange in arrays and\nintegrate with electronics.5\u20138 Although such components are\ncommonplace in the visible and near infrared (,1.55 mm),\nthere have to date been inadequate reports of optical switch-\ning in the midinfrared spectral region ~2\u20135 mm!. In this let-\nter, we report on the optical quenching of midinfrared elec-\ntroluminescence at 3.0 mm, which could form the basis of a\nmidinfrared optical switch\nThe light-emitting diode ~LEDs! were fabricated from\nIII-V double heterostructures ~DHs! grown by liquid phase\nepitaxy ~LPE!. A conventional horizontal, graphite sliding\nboat was used for the LPE growth of the LED structures onto\np-type InAs ~100! substrates. These were 14 mm314 mm\nsquare with a carrier concentration of ;131018 cm23 and\nwere obtained from Wafer Technology Ltd. Epitaxy was car-\nried out with the graphite boat inside a high purity quartz\nreactor tube under flowing ultrapure hydrogen gas provided\nfrom a Pd-diffusion unit. The apparatus was fully automated\nand controlled with LABVIEW operating software from a per-\nsonal computer. The resulting epitaxial structure, which has\nbeen described in detail previously elsewhere,9 was a DH in\nwhich the unintentionally doped n-InAs active layer is en-\nclosed between p- and n-InAs0.42Sb0.18P0.40 confinement lay-\ners. The P content in the confinement layers was 0.40 ~Eg\n5640 meV and T54 K! to provide large interface band off-\nsets DEc5151 meV and DEv521 meV for good carrier\nconfinement. The InAs active region ~Eg5415 meV and T\n54 K! was 0.7 mm thick, and the InAs0.42Sb0.18P0.40 layers\nwere isoperiodic with InAs, each being 3.0 mm in thickness.\nBy using Yb rare-earth gettering, the residual carrier concen-\na!Electronic mail: a.krier@lancaster.ac.uk2820003-6951\/2002\/80(16)\/2821\/3\/$19.00tration in the active layer was reduced to ,531015 cm23.\nThe cladding layers were intentionally doped with Sn up to a\nconcentration of 531018 cm23 and with Zn up to 1\n31018 cm23 for n- and p-sides, respectively.\nLEDs were fabricated from the epitaxial wafers using\nstandard procedures by employing conventional photolithog-\nraphy and reactive ion etching with CH4 :H2 to produce me-\nsas 420 mm in diameter with an emitting area of 1.39\n31023 cm2. After etching, the mesa was passivated with\nSi3N4 . Ohmic contacts were formed by thermal evaporation\nof Au:Zn and Au:Te alloys at 180 \u00b0C on the p- and n sides of\nthe structures, respectively. A 300 mm diameter ohmic ring\ncontact pad ~30 mm width! was defined on the n\nInAs0.42Sb0.18P0.40 while the corresponding back contact was\ndeposited over the entire rear surface of the chip. The LED\nchips were then mounted n side up onto TO-49 headers for\ntesting using In solder. The resulting devices were operated\nwith a drive current of 300 mA using 50 ms pulses at a\nfrequency of 10 kHz, ~duty cycle 50%!. The 4 K electrolu-\nminescence emission spectra from the edge of the LEDs\nwere measured and compared for different levels of external\nillumination. A schematic diagram of the resulting light emit-\nting diodes is shown in Fig. 1.\nTo study the effect of optical radiation on the electrolu-\nminescence, the sample was illuminated with coherent radia-\nFIG. 1. ~a!

The resulting emission was measured from the\nedge of the sample. The laser output power was varied from\n0 to 5 W, which represents a maximum optical excitation\nintensity at the sample of ;80 W cm22 inside the cryostat.\nThe resulting electro- or photoluminescence ~PL! was col-\nlected using CaF2 lenses and focused into a Bentham M300\nmonochromator. A cooled ~77 K! InSb photodiode and Stan-\nford Research ~SR850! digital lock-in amplifier were used to\ndetect the radiation. A computer was used to control the\nmonochromator and record the output signal using LABVIEW\noperating software.\nThe results of the spectral measurements are shown in\nFigs. 2 and 3. It was found that the electroluminescence in-\ntensity decreased exponentially with increasing external illu-\nmination intensity. It was also noticed that the spectrum\nchanged shape and became broader as the external illumina-\ntion intensity increased. Careful examination of the spectrum\nobtained allows one to establish that without the external\nillumination the electroluminescence spectrum consists of\ntwo emission bands @B and C in Figs. 2 and 3~a!#. It is\nreasonable to attribute these bands to the emission originat-\ning from recombination between localized electrons and\nholes in quasi-quantum wells situated on opposite sides of\nthe two heterointerfaces in the active region as shown in Fig.\n4. The more intense band corresponds to transition B because\nthe p-n junction is situated right at this boundary. Deconvo-\nlution and analysis of the optical spectrum under external\nillumination using Gaussian curve fitting shows that three\nemission bands are now present in the electroluminescence\nas shown in Fig. 3~b!. A new emission band ~A! appears in\nthe spectrum ~see Figs. 2 and 3! under external illumination.\nWe note that in a PL experiment on the LED structure a\nsingle broad band which does not change shape with small\nforward or reverse applied bias (,0.1 V) is observed. This\nbroad band can be readily deconvoluted into the same bands\nA, B, and C observed in Figs. 2 and 3. We rule out heating\nFIG. 2. 4 K electroluminescence emission spectra obtained from the edge of\nthe LED measured with increasing optical illumination using a drive current\nof 300 mA at a frequency of 10 kHz with 50 ms pulses.

Furthermore, the\nmagnitude of the quenching effect (325) which we ob-\nserved is much too large to be of thermal origin.\nThe relative intensity of emission band B @Fig. 3~b!#\nFIG. 3.

Phys. Lett., Vol. 80, No. 16, 22 April 2002 Krier et al.becomes less than that of band C as the external illumination\nintensity is increased. In our opinion, the appearance of the\nband A is associated with the additional electron\u2013hole pair\nproduction in the n InAs0.42Sb0.18P0.40 as a result of the in-\ntense external excitation. On application of the external illu-\nmination, electron\u2013hole pairs are generated in the n InAsSbP\nnear the negative contact. The excess holes are driven toward\nthe negative contact by the electric field and the electrons try\nand drift into the p region. The high electron\u2013hole density\nnear the interface results in band bending which \u2018\u2018traps\u2019\u2019\nelectrons in the optically induced potential well and so ac-\ncounts for the appearance of the high energy emission band\nA. The quenching of band B relative to band C at the n-N\ntype II heterojunction we attribute to the increased height of\nthe potential barrier which restricts electron supply into the\nactive region. With increasing illumination intensity, the\nbands B and C shifted towards the red region ~from 2.989 to\n3.045 mm and from 3.070 mm to 3.090 mm for B and C,\nrespectively!, whereas the band A shifted to the red ~from\n2.857 to 2.925 mm! and then back to the blue ~2.925 to 2.918\nmm!. Our findings are in accordance with the luminescence\nresults from other materials including Si,10,11 Ge,12 and\nGaAs,13 where a similar phenomenon has been observed at\nthe surface.\nIt should be mentioned that in this LED without the ex-\nternal illumination, optical amplification takes place due to\nthe whispering gallery modes produced in the active region\nas we described in detail previously.14 Restricting the supply\nof electrons for recombination at B effectively spoils the gain\nof the whispering mode and so the intensity decreases rap-\nidly. As shown in Fig. 5, we also measured the dependence\nof the degree of polarization of the total electroluminescence\nemission p i2p\u2019 \/p i1p\u2019 on the illumination intensity, and\nfound that it falls linearly from 45% to 15%. This is consis-\ntent with a strong reduction in the band B which is inherently\npolarized since it is a transition between quantum states on\nopposite sides of the heterointerface, whereas A is unpolar-\nFIG. 5. Dependence of electroluminescence polarization on external illumi-\nnation intensity measured from the edge of the LED at 4 K.ized. Alternatively, since the light emitted from the edge\noriginates from a whispering mode which is itself polarized,\nthe incident external illumination could produce a local re-\nduction in refractive index in the InAs which reduces the\neffectiveness of the ring waveguide and results in depolar-\nization of the light emitted from the edge of the LED.\nThe edge electroluminescence emission spectrum of a\nwhispering gallery midinfrared LED has been investigated\nwith and without external illumination using visible coherent\nlight ~514 nm!. Without external illumination the spectra\nconsists of two emission bands, which are due to type-II\nrecombination at both heteroboundaries of the active region.\nUnder strong external illumination, we observed depolariza-\ntion and quenching of the LED emission and the appearance\nof a weak optically induced-interface emission band. The\npossibility of such optically induced band bending leading to\nnew emission bands in type-II heterojunctions has been\npredicted,15 but until now has not been observed. The strong\nquenching which we observed was sufficient to effectively\nswitch off the electroluminescence from the LED. Although\ndemonstrated at low temperature and using high optical ex-\ncitation, this result opens the opportunity for creation of mid-\ninfrared optical switches, modulators, and other light-\ncontrolled midinfrared devices.\nThe authors wish to thank EPSRC for the award of a\nresearch grant to support this work.
