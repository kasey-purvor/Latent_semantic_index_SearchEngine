Some would doubtless argue that communi-\nties evolve and cannot be created. This may point to a key element missing from the\nscenario described, i.e. a compelling reason for users to access the resources and\nparticipate in the communities provided for them by learning technologists.\nAccess to technology for educational use is a broader issue, as Burbules and\nCallister (2000) explain. In their definition, access involves having physical and oper-\national capability, professional and cultural fluency and an appropriate conceptual\nmodel that allows competent interaction, innovation and creativity. This is still a long\nway off from many of the target users\u2019 current access levels.\nThe separation of the roles of expert, designer and intended user may be the root\nof the problem of mass participation identified by the authors. The disciplines of HCI\nand computer system design needed the involvement of professionals from other disci-\nplines to overcome the barriers created by expert driven software engineering. So too,\nthe mainstream use of technology in education may be awaiting the arrival of the lay\npractitioner in system specifications. To label this a problem is perhaps unfair, though.\nExperience tells us that designers of new technology rarely, if ever, foresee what their\ncreation will eventually be used for or how long its infusion into practice will take.\nIf history provides a useful model, then the designer\u2019s role is to develop the oppor-\ntunity for a critical mass of users to gain access and then devise their own useful\n*Centre for Professional Development, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New\nZealand.

However, since users never know what they don\u2019t know, asking them what they\nwant invariably yields results with limitations. What this questioning process does\u2014\nextremely well in this case\u2014is provide a sound basis for the development of a portal\nthat reflects the needs and current capabilities of a range of practitioners in the field\nof learning technology. Presumably not, though, of the entire potential target user\ngroup, because only those with some experience of using learning technology may\nhave been included in the research process. These needs analysis limitations relate\nback to the broader issues of access mentioned in the opening paragraph, and\nunavoidably exclude those potential users who currently do not have this capacity.\nThe debate about whether the RESULTS community was a core of specialists or\na wider group is indeed a key question. If a \u2018dictionary definition\u2019 of a community of\npractice is applied, and particularly if the focus is on a learning community, it will\nsurely involve a wider group so the less experienced can interact with and learn from\nthe more experienced. Radiation of knowledge outwards from a core group of experts\nis a key learning opportunity, while interaction with less experienced users can\nprovide understanding of the novice perspective as an input to design specifications.\nThe portal that was developed as a result of this research is one key element in an\nevolving landscape, where no one person or group can see the entire composition. It\nis another instance of the complex interaction of individually complex systems that\ninevitably leads to unexpected outcomes. As Edward Tenner (1996) reminds us,\nthese outcomes are sometimes good, sometimes not, but they are usually unpredict-\nable.\nSo if the RESULTS developers see a long way to go for the portal to enter main-\nstream use, perhaps they need to accept that they can guide the situation so far but\nnot all the way. They have taken some very important steps in the right direction. The\nrest is up to the users. They want to support, though any amount of training and\ndevelopment still cannot add the final variable to the equation. Time is another\nessential ingredient in any significant culture shift, and that shift is what now needs\nto take place. There are many barriers to overcome\u2014not all of them the responsibility\nof the developers.\nOne aspect (perhaps aspiration is a better term in this context) of a functional\ncommunity is that the discourse of the discipline uses shared language with common\nunderstandings. It may be safe to assume that semantic differences are just one of\nmany cultural variations that a learning technology portal will have to accommodate.\nA useful alternative to specific targeting of a range of differences is to simply acknowl-\nedge and attempt to accommodate them. Anything else may be too hard to achieve.\nIn this respect, the paper does identify different categories of user and their preference\nfor resource types. Academics prefer to have specific needs addressed while interme-\ndiaries want adaptability. This seems a logical reflection of roles and confirmation of\nthe need for a range of different materials to suit a variety of users.\nAnother barrier RESULTS seems to have managed to overcome is the technical\none. Most users do not and probably never will want to engage with the concepts of\n Creating virtual communities of practice for learning technology in higher education:\n \n97\n        metadata and interoperability standards. In this case, those that do can and those that\ndon\u2019t, don\u2019t have to. If the simplicity of the technical description in the paper reflects\nthe visibility of technology to users of the portal then another important hurdle has\nbeen crossed. It may even have demystified this aspect for some readers.\nIn conclusion, the key remaining challenge underlies interpretation of the state-\nment that \u2018RESULTS has been less successful in securing a critical mass of user\nparticipation\u2019. Reasons are offered to explain the slow speed of uptake and possible\nremedies given\u2014but here may be an important omission. The fact that \u2018it is not yet\nunderstood how people use portals\u2019 overlooks the complex nature of the evolving\ninter-relationship between expert and non-expert users and learning technology. It\nimplies a need to understand existing practice better, although this does not reflect\nthe reality of the innovation. The product of the synergy between current practice and\nnew technology cannot be known at this stage of the integration process and is prob-\nably out with the control of the designers. While all the right steps have been taken to\nfacilitate the process, there is a time when designers have to step back, be satisfied\nwith their (excellent) creation and move on to the next task leaving users to make their\nown way. Now may not be the time to remove the training wheels but it will surely\ncome. The required outcome is nothing short of a culture shift, upon which the polit-\nical dimension (so lightly mentioned but so significant) will doubtless impact. Ulti-\nmately, it is up to the individuals who comprise the community to determine what the\nnature of this shift will be.\nReferences\nBurbules, N. & Callister, T.
