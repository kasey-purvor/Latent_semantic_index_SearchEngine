Instead of \nnumbers being called out, students are given a verbal clue that fits with one of the \nanswers on their playing grid.

The interactive and light-hearted \nmedium of a bingo game can provide motivation for study and enhance learning by the \nstudents.  Protein revision bingo is included as an example. \n \nIntroduction: It has been recognised that the traditional lecture is frequently a passive \nexperience for students and approaches that enhance their active participation in the \nlearning process can deepen understanding [1].  Recommendations for improving \nlearning have included the introduction of short breaks into a lecture, during which \nstudents might be encouraged to either summarise in their own words the key concepts \ncovered thus far, or to note down a question they should like the lecturer to address at a \nlater stage.  Similarly. a quiz or formative exam conducted as part of the lecture \nprogramme can improve the recall of information [1].  Revision bingo, outlined below, \nis one such means of introducing a different dynamic into the teaching of biochemistry \nand molecular biology. \n \nDescription of the game: The concept is very straightforward.  Students are attempting \nto complete a line on their board in order to win.  Rather than simply matching a \nnumber, however, they are trying to find the answer to a clue or definition given by the \ntutor or lecturer.   \n \nIn a real game of bingo each participant would have a unique playing card, but for \nrevision bingo it is recommended that all students having the same playing grid.  In the \nera of desktop publishing it would be a relatively easy task to construct a range of cards, \nbut there are educational advantages to be gained if all players are using the same board.  \nIn particular, the instructor retains control of the number of questions posed before a \nwinning line is generated, and can therefore maximise the material reviewed before \nanyone wins.   \n \nDoesn\u2019t that mean everybody will generate a winning line at the same time?  Yes, in \ntheory, but in my experience \u2013 including a game in a lecture theatre with around 100 \nstudents \u2013 there has always been a clear winner.  Although a small group tutorial is \nprobably the ideal environment for revision bingo, you can get away with playing in a \nlarger forum if you plan completion of a line to occur with one of the more tricky \nanswers, and pose a question that begins obscure, but becomes progressively more \nobvious.  Players who declare early, i.e. before a winning line has really been generated, \nshould be dealt with sensitively \u2013 their mistake is more likely to stem from an accidental \nwrong answer than an overwhelming desire to gain whatever small prize you have put \non offer.  A ban from declaring after the next question is probably sufficient, they can \nbe back \u2018in\u2019 after that. \n \nThe example given here has been used at the end of a series of introductory lectures on \nproteins for first year undergraduates.  A grid of 5 by 5 allows sufficient questions to be \nposed before a winning line is produced.  A word-processed table with 5 columns of 5.6 \ncm (2.16 inches) fits conveniently on to an A4 landscape page.  As far as possible \nsimilar words\/concepts have been dispersed around the grid and answers chosen so that \nonly one solution should fit each question.   \n \nEducational benefits: Revision bingo is flexible and fun.  The concept can easily be \nadapted to fit any subject matter, and can be employed in a range of settings from \nlecture hall to tutorial group, either with students working as individuals or in teams.  \nAlthough the quick-fire nature of the game is most suited to \u2018recall\u2019 questioning, there is \nno reason why the system could not be adapted to probe students\u2019 understanding of \nconcepts at a deeper level.  The game can add challenge and enjoyment to the learning \nof course material. \n \n \nAcknowledgments \nI am grateful to Clive Bagshaw and Christine Wells for helpful comments about this \nproject. \n \nReference \n[1] Bonwell C.C. and Eison J.A.
