This paper offers an \nanalysis of this debate by introducing a heuristic distinction between aid 'radicals' and aid \n'reformers'. The radical position is notable as it uncharacteristically unites neo-liberals \nand neo-Marxists against foreign aid, while reformers espouse the tenets of \nmanagerialism as an ideological and practical vehicle for aid's improvement.   Radicals \nremain skeptical and suspicious of reformist managerial utopias, while aid reformers see \nlittle value to radical nihilism. This paper calls for an end to the Great Aid Debate by \nmoving to a discussion of foreign aid that intertwines both radical and reformist \nperspectives.  The 'radical reform' of foreign aid is both desirable and achievable so long \nas aid is re-theorized as a contested, commonsensical, contingent and civically oriented \nendeavor.  \n 2 \nIntroduction\t\r \u00a0\n \n A \u201cGreat Aid Debate\u201d has played itself out in popular books on the New York \nTimes bestseller list but has escaped close analytic examination, even as this debate \nincreasingly impinges on public perceptions of foreign aid and real development policies. \nThe Great Aid Debate centers on the contested value of foreign aidi and the wider aid \nsystem as vehicles for achieving development.  Whilst economists continue to debate the \nquestion of aid\u2019s impact on development as proxied by macro-level variables like growth, \npoverty and inequality, such conversations often degenerate into complex disagreements \nconcerning the econometric analysis conducted to establish claims and positions. In \ncontradistinction, the Great Aid Debate elevates and extends these concerns to the level \nof aid policy by asking whether aid is, on balance, a vehicle of harm or for good in \ndeveloping societies.   Although largely a normative clash, this has not prevented either \nside of this debate from harnessing a substantial evidentiary basis to support their \nrespective claims.   \n This paper offers an analysis of this Great Aid Debate by introducing a distinction \nbetween aid 'radicals' and aid 'reformers'.  This binary presentation of positions in the \ndebate is offered as a stylized heuristic device that can nevertheless usefully tease out \npoints of convergence and divergence within this debate.  On one side are aid \u2018radicals,\u2019 a \nheterogeneous group of voices straddling the political spectrum who exhibit apparent \nconvergence in their opposition to foreign aid, particularly the way such flows are \norganized, managed and delivered by aid agencies.ii  On the other side, aid reformers \nrepresent many committed members of the development policy and academic community \nwho believe corporate managerial reform to the aid system is both possible and desirable \nfor improved development outcomes.  In the first and second sections, each of these \npositions is examined in more detail.  While an ideological split defines the radical camp \nand suggests more diversity than perhaps one might first assume, reformers remain \nrelatively united in their belief that business managerialism is the main vehicle for \nameliorating foreign aid.     \n 3 \n Once radical and reformist arguments are presented, section three asks whether \nthere is a way to re-theorize aid and its administration such that it becomes less harmful \nthan radicals suggest and more robustly improved than simplified managerial reforms \nimply.    The excessive pessimism of aid radicals and the unwarranted optimism of aid \nreformers has to date limited a productive and pragmatic conversation on future \ndirections for aid, raising questions about the value of the divisive Great Aid Debate. \nEnding the Great Aid Debate becomes a desirable possibility with the continuities and \ndiscontinuities that separate radicals and reformers made transparent.  A way forward is \noffered by reconceptualizing foreign aid as an endeavor involving contested goals, \ncommonsensical processes, contingent practices and civic values.  If foreign aid is ever to \nbe truly effective, what is required is no less than its radical reform. \nGlass\t\r \u00a0half\t\r \u00a0empty:\t\r \u00a0radical\t\r \u00a0perspectives\t\r \u00a0on\t\r \u00a0aid\t\r \u00a0 \t\r \u00a0\n Criticisms of foreign aid as both a mechanism and administrative apparatus for \nachieving higher living standards in the developing world are not new (Bauer, 1972, \nEscobar, 1993, Sachs, 1990, Montgomery, 1980).    What is different with contemporary \ncritiques is the extent to which these arguments have achieved prominence in the public \ndomain.  Nowadays, expressions of aid skepticism are both commonplace and a mainstay \nfor a variety of professionals (including many former aid managers and bureaucrats).  \nNevertheless, the irony is that the radical perspective unites neo-Marxist and neo-liberal \nperspectives in denouncing foreign aid. Both sets of radicals now seem to agree that \nforeign aid is unnecessary at best, pernicious at its worst. Is this relatively downbeat \nassessment that emerges from highly divergent political starting points suggestive of a \nserious malaise with foreign aid?  Or are there differences that distinguish their respective \npessimism over the prospects for aid?   \nRadicals\t\r \u00a0on\t\r \u00a0the\t\r \u00a0right\t\r \u00a0\n Radicals on the right are strident in their criticisms of foreign aid.   Many have \ncatapulted to public attention via bestsellers written by economists like Bill Easterly\u2019s \nThe White Man\u2019s Burden and Dambisa Moyo\u2019s Dead Aid.  These radicals maintain that \n 4 \nnot only does aid fail to achieve its developmental aims, it creates dependencies that keep \ncountries poor and even worsen the burden of poverty.  Aid crowds out investment by \nhindering the operation of free markets, encourages corruption and fosters reliance on \nforeign munificence to the detriment of self-help and innovation (Moyo, 2009).  The aid \nindustry stands accused of having concentration ratios that approximate a carteliii and the \nplanning mindsets of Communist apparatchiks (Easterly, 2002, Whittle and Kuraishi, \n2008). Public bureaucracies are lambasted for the way they have administered foreign \nassistance using the slow cumbersome and inefficient command-and-control approaches \nof state \u201cplanners\u201d (Easterly, 2006b, Easterly, 2008).  Planning mentalities dominate the \ndonor industry, and while this is claimed to be inefficient and ineffectual, it keeps the \nindustry and its elites in business.  \nSetting a beautiful goal such as making poverty history, the Planners\u2019 \napproach then tries to design the ideal aid agencies, administrative plans, and \nfinancial resources that will do the job.  Sixty years of countless reform \nschemes to aid agencies and dozens of different plans, and $2.3 trillion later, \nthe aid industry is still failing to reach the beautiful goal.  The evidence points \nto an unpopular conclusion: Big Plans will always fail to reach the beautiful \ngoal (Easterly, 2006: 11). \n The scope for improvement of the aid industry is limited for right-wing radicals.  \nEasterly appears to advocate dismantling the public aid architectures privileging \n\u201cstrategies and frameworks\u201d in favour of demand-driven aid agencies relying on the \nnimble \u201csearching\u201d of bargain-hunting venture capitalists looking for their next \ninvestment opportunity (2006b: 206-207).  He perhaps sees greater scope for reform than \nhis counterpart Moyo, albeit involving revolutionary changes to the aid system.  In \ncontrast, Moyo simply seeks to end the myth that aid is effective or can be made \neffective. Feeding the bureaucracies that sustain the Western aid industry is, for Moyo, \nnot only unproductive but harmful and she actively calls for dismantling the industry \naltogether to reduce this harm.  In its place, she advocates market-based policies that she \nclaims address the root causes of poverty, namely lack of access to capital and adequate \ntrading opportunities.   Her aid-free solution to the problem of under-development in \nAfrica thus relies on a combination of open trade policy, microfinance, bond market \nfinancing and Chinese investment (Moyo, 2009: xix, 74).  \n 5 \nRadicals\t\r \u00a0of\t\r \u00a0the\t\r \u00a0left\t\r \u00a0\n As contemporary criticisms by economists like Easterly and Moyo raise our \ndoubts about the efficiency and effectiveness of foreign aid, there is a tendency to gloss \nover critical perspectives in development studies situated in neo-Marxist anthropological \nand sociological traditions that share their aid skepticism but lack their public profile.  \nInspired by the social theory of Michel Foucault, this group argues that the discourse of \nunder-development that is expounded by the aid industry represents poor countries and \ntheir citizens as hapless subjects in need of Western assistance, advancement and \nmodernity as they are incapable of directing their own social and political transformation \n(Escobar, 1995a, Escobar, 1995b, Ferguson, 1994, Esteva, 1993, Rist, 2002). The neo-\ncolonial business of aid silences the autonomy and agency of local communities and \ncitizens by the power of its representation such that this maintains the status quo of \nunder-development.  Development discourses strip the problems of poverty of intractable \npolitical content in order to portray the technical efficiency and efficacy of the foreign \nadministrative apparatus. The mission of poverty reduction justifies the existence, \ninterventions and perpetuation of the aid industry and its elites who depend on foreign aid \nas a source of power. Via aid planning, an effective network of power is established over \nsubalterns in the South (Escobar, 1993: 133-134).   \n Development planners seek administrative legibility out of situations of social and \npolitical complexity and, in doing so, implicitly subscribe to high modernist notions of \nprogress as both feasible and achievable (Scott, 1998). Aid defers rather than creates \nopportunities for the sustainable eradication of poverty as it distracts attention from the \nstructural, capitalist sources of under-development.   As a result, neo-Marxian radicals \nrecommend looking beyond development, advocating the dissolution of aid planning \narchitectures and aid experts in particular in favor of celebrating indigenous social \nmovements and local practical knowledge (Escobar, 1993, Escobar, 1995a, Ferguson, \n1994, Scott, 1998, Mitchell, 2002). This \u2018post-development\u2019 position is also shared by a \nsubset of organizational studies scholars who theorize the negative consequences of the \nmodernism implicit in contemporary understandings of international development \nmanagement (Banu O Zkazan, 2008; Cooke, 2004; Cooke & Dar, 2008b; Dar, 2008; \n 6 \nMurphy, 2008). This school of \u2018critical development management\u2019 views the idealized \napplication of modernist management to questions of development, especially via the \nadministrative apparatus constituted by foreign aid, as fundamentally pernicious to the \ninterests of those who believe in emancipatory development and democratic organization. \nWhile more recent work has begun to consider the possibility of reconstructing \ndevelopment into a more democratic and progressive force, this remains a minority \nposition among the radical left.iv  \nRadical\t\r \u00a0continuities\t\r \u00a0and\t\r \u00a0discontinuities\t\r \u00a0\nWhile there have been attempts to counter the left wing radical critique that all aid \nis an object of oppression and right wing radicalism that aid must exclusively choose \nbetween planning hierarchies and free markets (with positive emphasis on the latter) \n(Barder, 2009), there has been little or no work to date exploring how these two \u2018radical\u2019 \nperspectives on foreign aid relate to each other and how their joint pessimism might be \ntranscended.   \nFor both the neo-liberal and neo-Marxist radicals, there are a number of \ncommonalities across their criticism.  First, it is the politico-administrative system within \nwhich foreign aid is situated that is blamed as a source of failure.   Both variants of \nradicalism converge on the limitations of the planning processes within the aid industry \nthat either prevents foreign aid from achieving its stated goals or else worsens the status \nquo of under-development.  Post-war aid architectures are claimed to have universally \nfailed to achieve their goal of removing poverty and kick-starting industrialization in the \nthen newly independent states.  Secondly, the aid industry is understood to be a global \nhegemonic complex that cultivates peripheral states dependent on benevolent interests in \nthe global core. Similarly, dependency effects are felt at the citizen-level and limit \npossibilities for agency, entrepreneurship and empowerment.   Thirdly, the aid apparatus \nthat has justified its own existence in terms of the reduction of poverty does not \nadequately target or stridently alleviate the institutional sources of under-development, \nfor example the iniquities within the global capitalist system or the asymmetries \ngoverning international trade policy.  Lastly, the aid industry survives by ensuring \n 7 \nsustainable demand for its expertise and services, in other words its existence is \npredicated on the continuation of poverty and under-development.   \nDespite these shared criticisms by aid radicals, there is some reason to believe that \nthe appearance of convergence is more than a little deceiving.  Divergences between the \ntwo perspectives are perhaps greater than shared radical concerns.  For aid radicals of the \nleft, aid is the source of concentrated oppressive power for both national and trans-\nnational elites.  This limits the possibility of emancipation of the sub-alterns aid claims to \nchampion.  For the radical right however, elites that represent market interests rather than \nthe heavy hand of the state can be a source of prosperity as they usher in greater \nopportunities for trade, financial investment and economic growth.   Moreover, for neo-\nMarxists aid is a vehicle that strips the problem of poverty from its political causes and \nconsequences in order to perpetuate the myth of quick achievable development wins and \nunproblematic modernization processes.  This de-politicization of the poverty problem is, \nin fact, decidedly political as it entrenches the conditions of under-development and the \npower of elites (Ferguson, 1994). Radicals of the right may look beyond aid but they still \nsee scope for technocratic development via trade policy, economic openness, voucher \nsystems and micro-lending.   These solutions subscribe to the tenets of free markets with \nlittle consideration of the political economy involved in their operation.  In addition, aid \nradicals of the left understand the aid project as part and parcel of neo-liberal agendas \nserving the interests of capitalism while paying lip service to social justice and human \nrights concerns, the traditional mainstay of social movements and indigenous knowledge.  \nMeanwhile, for those on the right, aid sustains cumbersome and inefficient donor \nbureaucracies that contribute to the overall lack of performance of the industry.  The aid \nindustry approximates an anti-competitive cartel and possesses an anti-market bias that \nstifles innovation and accountability from aid recipients.  By contrast, radicals of the left \nare not concerned by the lack of efficiency within aid planning but by the way planners \norders realities in ways that preserves governmentality by the state. \n \n If aid management is oppressive for the radical left then, it is inefficient and \nineffectual for the radical right.  If aid effectiveness requires more market-based solutions \n 8 \nand mentalities for those on the right, for the left it is only social movements\u2019 \ncommitments to justice and their embedded local knowledge that can bring about the \ndramatic transformation needed to address the conditions of under-development.  It \nwould thus seem that the differences that distinguish right and left wing aid radicals are \nmore significant than may first appear. Nonetheless, their ultimate conclusion concerning \nthe value of foreign aid is identical, namely that it is an ineffectual vehicle for generating \ndevelopment that is not only harmful but also expendable.    \n \nGlass\t\r \u00a0half\t\r \u00a0full:\t\r \u00a0reforming\t\r \u00a0aid\t\r \u00a0for\t\r \u00a0greater\t\r \u00a0effectiveness\t\r \u00a0\n While there are numerous responses to the radical critique of aid, all of them \ncommonly converge on ways to improve the ways aid is organized, managed and \ndelivered in order to enhance its development impact. Contemporary aid reformers \nrepresent a long line of figures since US President Harry Truman committed to support \nan administrative and professional space called \u2018foreign aid\u2019 in 1949 (Rist, 2002, \nEscobar, 1995a). As disappointment with aid\u2019s achievements has ebbed and flowed, so \ntoo have ideas around how to reinvigorate it to achieve the ambitious vision Truman first \nproposed for \u201cimprovement and growth of underdeveloped areas\u201d (Truman, 1949). The \nreform of aid is now a multi-million dollar business (Riddell, 2007) linking a diverse \narray of guidelines circulating in the development policy sphere on how to fix the \nproblems with aid.  \nWith some notable exceptions, most contemporary aid reformers share an ideal of \nimprovement that borrows from managerial logics (Easterly, 2008, Sachs, 2005, Whittle \nand Kuraishi, 2008).v  Managerialism is defined as a \u201cset of beliefs and practices, at the \ncore of which burns the seldom-tested assumption that better management will prove an \neffective solvent for a wide range of economic and social ills\u201d (Pollitt, 1990: 1). While \nmanagerialism shares with the concept of \u2018technocracy\u2019 a belief in the possibility of \nplanning, technocracy is more commonly a reference to rational Weberian bureaucratic \nsystems (Parkin, 1994: 19). In contrast, managerialism is premised on the inherent \ninadequacies of traditional public administration and advocates the insertion of business \n 9 \nlogics into public affairs (Pollitt, 1997: 52, 56). A characteristic feature of managerialism \nis thus a relatively uncritical acceptance of corporate management in all administrative \ncontexts.  \nWhile managerialism has been part of American administrative ideology for \nnearly a century, it gained new force on both sides of the Atlantic beginning in the early \n1970s as a way to downsize the sluggish and inflexible administrative systems of the state \n(Lynn, 2006).  This was initially in the context of demands for cost-reduction and \nefficiency enhancements to the public sector that fanned out across the world as a global \nprinciple of government reform (Minogue et al., 1998, Bowornwathana, 2000, Haque, \n1996, Sahlin-Andersson, 2001, Hirschmann, 1999, Desai and Imrie, 1998). The term \n\u2018New Public Management\u2019 (NPM)vi was coined to characterize the similarity of the neo-\nliberal administrative doctrines applied to public sector reform in all of these countries \n(Hood, 1991).  Beyond the public sector, managerial elements are also visible within \ninternational organizations like the World Bank (Murphy, 2008a, Murphy, 2008b) and \nnon-governmental organizations (Roberts et al., 2005, Lewis, 2001).   \nContemporary aid reformists have been some of the most optimistic adherents to \nmanagerial logics and their application to aid administration and planning as a way to \ncoax improvement and higher performance.  And yet, there are flimsy empirical \nfoundations for advocating managerialism as a platform for reform. (Pollitt, 1997: 67). \nManagerialism stands accused of assuming high levels of equivalence between public \nand private realms that discounts the conflicting goals characteristic of public \nenvironments (Pollitt, 1990); of being applied dogmatically and by centralizing control in \na manner can be inherently anti-democratic (Kilby, 2004, Enteman, 1993:184); of \nreplacing civic virtues, moral purposes and public service sentiments with substantive \nprocedures of management motivated by efficiency (Parkin, 1994: 79, Pollitt, 1990: 138); \nof creating new hierarchies and systems of authority with a powerful managerial elite at \nits apex (Murphy, 2008a, Murphy, 2008b); of introducing generic \u201ccookbooks of action\u201d \nthat are often not tailored to local circumstances (Pollitt, 1997); and of generally \nproducing outcomes in contrast to original claims and objectives (Diefenbach, 2009, \nParker, 2002).  Notwithstanding these concerns, managerialism\u2019s success comes from its \n 10 \nperceived legitimacy as a framework governing corporate excellence and from the \napparent universal application of its principles.   Managerialism thus serves as a powerful \ncontemporary ideology whose influence is exercised through organizations (Enteman, \n1993: 154). What follows is an exposition of how managerialism is infiltrating reformist \npositions within the Great Aid Debate and generating proverbs concerning the nature and \ndirections of aid reform.   \n \nThe\t\r \u00a0goal\t\r \u00a0of\t\r \u00a0corporate-\u00ad\u2010style\t\r \u00a0administrative\t\r \u00a0modernization\t\r \u00a0in\t\r \u00a0aid\t\r \u00a0\n Managerialism has its eye on achieving a state of improvement and modernization \nto public administrative systems. It attributes the need for improvement to ever-changing \nand fast-paced external environments of the corporate world where reform is assumed to \nbe immanent and inevitable (Diefenbach, 2009).   The underlying untested assumption is \nthat public bureaucracies are poorly performing in such environments and can be \nformally restructured along the lines of the private sector in order to generate efficiency \nand results (Pollitt, 1997: 52, Pollitt, 1990: 120). Organizational legitimacy is \nincreasingly obtained by the adoption of business logics, even if sometimes their pursuit \ncan distract from the real achievement of desired results (Meyer and Rowan, 1977, \nMoynihan and Pandey 2005).  This risks administrative reform becoming an end itself, \ndriven by a normative doctrinal consensus on the superiority of business planning.  \nAid reformers assume a teleological orientation towards the desired state of \nforeign aid improvement, where the design and purpose of reform is oriented to \nadministrative modernization of the aid apparatus in line with corporate best practice. \nThe justification for continuous improvements to foreign aid is reliant on a rhetorical \nidiom of aid\u2019s failures and imminent crisesvii that together threaten the fragile livelihoods \nof the world\u2019s poor.   The motif of failure and crisis as in the quote below drives the \nmomentum to reform and ameliorate foreign aid in the image of the corporate sector.  \nMany would argue that the over $1 trillion given in aid to developing \ncountries over the past half-century has failed---or at best has not produced \nresults.  Development challenges are daunting and vast.  [\u2026] Half the world \n 11 \npopulation lives on less than $2 per day.  One billion people cannot even \nsign their own name.  [\u2026]  We argue that bringing a few market elements \ninto traditional structures of foreign aid might remedy some of the \nshortcomings of today\u2019s bureaucratic and sluggish aid system (Whittle and \nKuraishi, 2008).   \nAid reformers remain confident that administrative improvement of foreign aid is \nsimply a matter of transferring corporate know-how into traditional public bureaucracies. \nThe dominant economic metaphors of comparative advantage, strategic niches and lower \ntransaction costs inspire common sense understandings and intuitions concerning the \nsuperiority and appropriateness of business logics as vehicles for the administrative \nmodernization of aid agencies. These logics are defined by their commitment to business \nflexibility, de-concentration, innovation, entrepreneurship and flat networks, all of which \nare attributes commonly associated with the private sector.  Managerialism cultivates \ncorporate doctrines as a legitimate way to both justify and frame reforms in aid \nadministration.    \nThe\t\r \u00a0scientific\t\r \u00a0process\t\r \u00a0of\t\r \u00a0aid\t\r \u00a0management\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n Managerialism is an ideology that assumes corporate doctrines operate as a tested \nrational science that can orderly and causally steer changes in the foreign aid apparatus.  \nIt is in this sense that the ideology of managerialism is inspired by Enlightenment \nunderstandings of progress as deriving from the application of rational science to control \ncomplex organizations and propel improved outcomes (Townley, 2001, Townley, 2002, \nTownley, 2008, Barley and Kunda, 1992, Simon, 1946). Managerialist prescriptions are \nadvanced with trans-scientific language that emphasizes scientific certainty and universal \napplicability even when scientific emergence and experimentation is untenable or \nuncertain (Pollitt, 1997, Hood, 1998).   \nThe post hoc justification of certain kinds of aid reforms as scientific best \npracticeviii notwithstanding limited and contested evidentiary bases best illustrates the \ninfiltration of managerialist ideology into the development space. To illustrate this, \nconsider the widely cited study suggesting that aid works in good institutional and policy \nenvironments that has been relied upon to justify the World Bank\u2019s decision to allocate \n 12 \naid financing on the basis of recipients\u2019 rankings on international benchmarks of good \ngovernance (Burnside and Dollar, 2000). Burnside and Dollar\u2019s findings and the policy \nprescriptions for aid selectivity have been widely disputed by many econometricians \noperating within the same 'scientific' canons as the authors (Hansen and Tarp, 2000, \nRajan and Subramanian, 2008, Roodman, 2007).  Nevertheless, this dispute has done \nlittle to temper enthusiasm for policies that selectively allocate aid according to the \nstrength of national governance systems.   An entire new area of research now builds on \nBurnside and Dollar\u2019s contested findings and ranks donor agencies according to their \nachievement on aid selectivity (Williamson, 2010, Easterly and Pfutze, 2008, Knack et \nal., 2010, Acharya et al., 2004).  This latter body of research, presenting itself as the \nscientific assessment of donor performance, firmly anchors aid selectivity as a best \npractice principle guiding aid agency reform, even where this representation remains a \ncontroversial and stylized understanding of the original Burnside and Dollar study.ix  \nHere, the academics and policy makers involved in advancing reform prescriptions are \nrelying on the apparently incontrovertible logic of deductive rational science to support \nspecious claims about the determinants of aid effectiveness and donor performance.  Aid \nreformers come to see scientific certainty in managerial prescriptions and scientific \npredictability in expected responses that sit comfortably with their desire for social order \nand control (van de Berg and Quarles van Ufford, 2005: 203). This lulls reformers into \nbelieving that improved aid outcomes are within easy reach as well as possibly \njeopardizing the search for the true drivers of improvement. \nAid\t\r \u00a0reform\t\r \u00a0via\t\r \u00a0abstract\t\r \u00a0practices\t\r \u00a0\n The scientific and corporate ideology of managerialism provides the basis for a \nmanagerial practice that derives its power from its universal applicability.  This drives \nmanagerialism to embrace abstract practices that simplify complexity in order to be both \nportable and generalizable.  The term \u2018abstract\u2019 refers to the ways in which specific \nknowledge of local contexts and lived experience is reduced and systematized by master-\nchefs into \u201ccookbooks of action\u201d (Pollitt, 1997). These cookbooks are intended as \nexplanatory frameworks that can replicate outcomes across time and space (Townley, \n2001, Townley, 2002).  Meanwhile, the master-chefs comprise a new professional class \n 13 \nin the public sector whose authority rests on their claims to management expertise \n(Parkin, 1994, Pollitt, 1990). The rise of master\u2019s degrees in development management \nand the phenomenal growth of the consulting industry is testimony to the efforts to \ncultivate this new class of professional aid managers.  These \u2018abstract\u2019 managerial \npractices and people both risk becoming anti-democratic elements within the aid \napparatus to the extent that they provide new mechanisms for social control that can \nbypass citizen input and involvement (Murphy, 2008a, Edwards, 1998, Diefenbach, 2009, \nMurphy, 2008b, Pollitt, 1990).  \nThe growth of performance measurement and management systems (PMMS) and \nmonitoring and evaluation professionals in aid agencies illustrate the widespread belief \nthat abstract practices in aid are vehicles for enhanced results.  \u2018Results-based \nmanagement\u2019 is increasingly prevalent in the aid sector; some examples include targets \nlike the Millennium Development Goals or Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness \nindicators, global rankings assessing everything from transparency, competitiveness and \nhuman development and intelligence gathering activities to assess aid agency employee \nperformance, project impacts and disbursements. While PMMS systems are expected to \ndrive performance in foreign aid by motivating desired actions, promoting learning, \nenhancing efficiency and improving transparency and accountability (Behn, 2003), their \nweaknesses suggest a more treacherous route to results. Not only do they tend to simplify \nhighly complex dynamics into numeric indicators that may not capture reality in a \nreliable, unbiased, parsimonious and meaningful manner. It remains a continuous \nchallenge to attribute changes in indicators directly to particular activities and actions. \nMeanwhile, a managerial professional class emerges and challenges the authority of those \nwith more embedded and embodied forms of knowledge that arguably have more direct \nrelevance for the search for results. PMMS tend to cause distortions that can shift \nincentives and drive out concerns over processes and quality. PMMS systems are not \nsimple thermometers that objectively take performance readings over time.  Rather, they \nare more like Swedish saunas that \u201cgive temperature to a body\u201d by altering the contexts \nwithin which performance is being measured (Hirschmann, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \noptimism of those seeking reform and improvement of aid management, coupled with the \ninstitutional imperatives of demonstrating aid performance in some scientifically \n 14 \nquantifiable way analogous to the private sector, ensures continual conduct and reliance \non abstract practices and professionals. \nEfficiency\t\r \u00a0and\t\r \u00a0impartiality\t\r \u00a0as\t\r \u00a0values\t\r \u00a0in\t\r \u00a0aid\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\nManagerial approaches define good administration in terms of efficiency.  While \nefficiency may be valuable if it allows for the satisfaction of a greater number of wants \ngiven the same stock of resources, reformers tend to forget this basis for efficiency.  \nInstead efficiency travels as a powerful corporate metaphor of unquestioned and \nunanalyzed administrative good, even if it comes at the expense of other societal wants \n(Pollitt, 1990: 142, Pollitt, 1997, Goodin and Wilenski, 1984: 512).  To the extent that \nmanagerialism privileges the value of efficiency without an in-depth understanding of \ncitizen wants and the purposes of public service contexts, the pursuit of efficiency makes \nlittle sense except as the blind emulation of business practice.  The efficiency imperative \ndominates reform agendas within aid agencies, best illustrated perhaps in terms of the \nimperative to reduce administrative costs. The comparative assessment of donor \nadministrative costs is undertaken without a clear understanding of tradeoffs in terms of \nopportunities gained or lost (Easterly, 2006a, Easterly and Pfutze, 2008).  Moreover, \neconomists acknowledge both the patchy data on aid\u2019s administrative costs and the lack \nof accepted definition of what constitutes these costs that makes comparative assessment \ntenuous.  The premise is simply that \u201cin line with best practices, most agencies agree that \nextreme overhead costs should be avoided\u201d (Williamson, 2010: 18). Efficiency remains a \ncherished managerial value among aid reformers.  \nAnother reason efficiency dominates as a value in aid reform is that it is perceived \nas value-free, or beyond political and social biases. Neutrality is thus another important \nvalue for aid reformers.  Managerialism draws a sharp dividing line between management \nand politics, and in doing so privileges impartiality as a dominant value of administration.   \nIt is in the realm of politics that political leaders set directions and steer decisions based \non normative judgments. Managers, meanwhile, are expected to concentrate on achieving \nthe public will expressed by political leaders by simply executing their directives \n(Edwards, 1998: 562, Aucoin, 1990: 116, Osborne and Gaebler, 1992). This separation \n 15 \nforms the foundation for the classic dichotomy in public administration between the \nadministrative and political spheres (Simon, 1946, Wilson, 1941).  Nevertheless, there is \nsome sense in which administrative practice has failed to maintain the impartiality \nimplied by the politics\/administration dichotomy.   There have been few coherent \nprescriptions to keep political actors from involvement in implementation issues (Pollitt, \n1997: 91-92).  Meanwhile, public managers can also be entrepreneurial actors involved in \ngoal setting and political management (Moore, 1995).  The result is that the \npolitics\/administration dichotomy is increasingly rejected and the political nature of \nadministration recognized (Svara, 2001, Svara, 2006, Rosenbloom, 1993).  \nNevertheless, aid reformers widely subscribe to reforms meant to remain beyond \npolitical dynamics.  Consider the way the \u2018aid effectiveness\u2019 agenda is framed by the \n2005 Paris Declaration of Aid Effectiveness. Aid effectiveness has taken on a specific \nand dominant meaning under this Declaration where the prescriptions for better delivery \nand management of foreign aid are divorced from political dynamics and relations that \nimpinge, for better or worse, on aid. The Declaration defines aid effectiveness in terms of \nfive principles captured in twelve indicators: aid recipients exercising leadership over \ndevelopment policies and strategies and leading coordination (ownership), donors basing \ntheir support on recipients\u2019 systems and priorities (alignment), reducing the transaction \ncosts of donor interventions (harmonization), introducing PMMS mechanisms (results-\nbased management) and ensuring commitment and respect between donors and recipients \n(mutual accountability).  The Declaration presents the challenge of aid effectiveness as a \nmatter of techno-administrative implementation rather than a problem deriving from the \npower and politics within which all aid relations are situated, including donor-aid \nrecipient relations, donor-donor relations and local political dynamics (Hayman, 2009: \n581-582, Hyden, 2008, Booth, 2008). For example, reporting on the Paris Declaration \nindicators has been subject to political interference by both donors and recipients, \nsuggesting monitoring and evaluation is never a straightforward and exclusively a-\npolitical matter (Hopper & Birch, 2010: 9).  The Paris Declaration may thus represent an \n\u201cunhelpful\u201d ideal of how aid could be better managed as it appears to exaggerate the ease \nwith which aid can be altered to deliver development outcomes.   Recent evaluations of \nthe Paris Declaration of Aid Effectiveness confirm this assessment, critiquing its framing \n 16 \nas a \u201ctechnical agreement\u201d rather than a \u201cpolitical agenda for action\u201d (Wood, Kabell, \nMuwanga & Sagasti, 2008: xii) with scant attention paid to the \u201cwider political, \neconomic and social contexts in which aid operates\u201d (Hopper & Birch, 2010: 9).   \n   \nThe diversity of arguments in favour of aid reform belies a shared implicit faith in \nthe tenets of managerialism for increasing foreign aid\u2019s ability to deliver progressive \nchange in developing societies. The ideology and practices of managerialism inspire a \nnumber of proverbs about the ways better management can improve foreign aid.  The \nreformist agenda is shaped by enthusiastic support for transposing corporate-style \nadministrative modernization into aid agencies.  Management processes are more often \nassumed to be a product of uncontestable rigorous scientific investigation rather than the \nresult of normative acceptance and collective wisdoms.  Interventions themselves rely on \nabstract practices supported by a managerial class who possess skills that are supposed to \nbe both learnable and universally applicable.  The values of managerialism assume that \nimpartiality and efficiency are necessary requirements for improving aid\u2019s impact.  \nOverall, aid reformers are optimistic about the simplicity, feasibility and desirability of \nmanagerial prescriptions to ameliorate foreign aid.  Attempts to achieve a more \n'Enlightened managerialism' do little to temper this conviction (de Vries, 2007). The \nfuture for foreign aid burns bright so long as managerial prescriptions get enacted and \nimplemented.   \nThe\t\r \u00a0radical\t\r \u00a0reform\t\r \u00a0of\t\r \u00a0foreign\t\r \u00a0aid\t\r \u00a0\nThe contemporary Great Aid Debate features a lively, if somewhat unproductive, \npolemic that pits those who radically denounce foreign aid against those who advocate \ngreater focus on its managerial reform. To the extent that either perspective engages with \nthe other, aid radicals remain skeptical of reformist managerial utopias, while aid \nreformers denounce the nihilistic critique of radicals.   Rather than collaborating on a \njoint project, each side seems to talk past each other in ways that limit the possibility of \naid\u2019s radical reform.   Assessing the relative strength of each perspective and declaring \n\u2018winners\u2019 and \u2018losers\u2019 of such a pitted and intractable division is ultimately a normative, \n 17 \nand a moot, point. The question that needs to be asked is whether there is a way to re-\ntheorize aid and its administration such that it becomes less harmful than radicals suggest \nand more robustly improved than simplified managerial reforms imply.   If such a \npossibility exists, the value of the divisive Great Aid Debate can at least be called into \nquestion.    \nEnding the Great Aid Debate becomes a decided possibility with the continuities \nand discontinuities that separate radicals and reformers now made transparent. Attempts \nto rebuild the credibility and effectiveness of foreign aid first can tackle head-on the \ncriticisms of aid radicals, particularly those common to the wide spectrum of political \nviews spanned by the radical perspective. In other words, the re-invention of foreign aid \ncan address shared radical concerns with aid\u2019s failure to achieve its goals and in may \ncases exacerbate under-development, its inculcation of dependency, its limited focus on \nthe structural causes of poverty and its tendency towards self-preservation.  At the same \ntime, re-theorizing foreign aid can offer opportunities for engagement that work towards \nremoving the conditions of underdevelopment but avoid unwarranted and uncritical faith \nin the tenets of managerialism as the exclusive administrative strategy of reform and \nimprovement. The future of aid can therefore be one where there is a deep commitment to \ndirect engagement and action to address under-development but that also avoids the \npitfalls identified by radicals and embraces alternatives to managerialism.  I argue this \n'radical reform' of foreign aid demands the reformulation of its goals, processes, practices \nand values.  A foreign aid that intertwines both radical and reformist perspectives is one \nthat considers itself as a contested, commonsensical, contingent and civically oriented \nendeavor.  Such a re-conceptualization pushes the Great Aid Debate beyond its current \nimpasse.   \n \n Contestable goals: A radically-reformist foreign aid does away with fixed goals \nand singular prescriptions and embraces aid giving as an act of political contestation \nrather than planned social engineering.   Radicals who claim that aid has not achieved its \ngoals ignore the fact that goal definitions in development are both disputed and dynamic.  \nGoals like poverty reduction in fact remain deeply controversial, notwithstanding the use \nof language that appears to offer the semblance of coherence and acceptability (Cornwall \n 18 \nand Brock, 2005).   Moreover, the objectives of aid change as the meaning of \ndevelopment shifts; aid that seeks to pursue development in terms of industrialization is a \ndifferent beast from aid that seeks to pursue human development, national accumulation \nor political emancipation (Pieterse Nederveen, 2001).   Similarly, aid reform cannot be \nconceived as the singular transposition of corporate templates into the public sector as if \nthis were the only organizational algorithm in existence. Creating all organizations in the \nmirror image of private corporations does not recognize that humans can coordinate their \nactivities and achieve collective goals via a huge variety of organizational templates \ninspired by everything from chess clubs to virtual terrorist networks (Parker, 2002: 202\u2013\n209). The dogmatic search for singular administrative solutions in foreign aid is \nultimately part of its problem (Pritchett and Woolcock, 2004).  Accepting the \ncontestability of aid's goals and its reform objectives requires any reconceptualization to \nembrace political pluralism and greater uncertainty. The natural state of foreign aid is \ncharacterized by tension and dynamic change. What is required from aid is an ability to \nsteer through morasses of contradictory and evolving objectives while still holding on to \na (contested) desired ends.  The aid system can thus be made more productive by \nfacilitating disagreement and debate rather than consensus and coherence (Eyben, 2010: \n10). So long as paralysis is precluded by such analysis, solutions can lie where conflicts \nbegin. \n \n \nCommonsensical processes: Aid radicals criticize foreign aid for not eliminating \nthe structural causes of poverty, while aid reformers assume there exists a scientifically \nproven process by which aid can deliver development outcomes. This debate can be \naddressed by having both sides converge on practical rationality as the underlying \nprocess involved in foreign aid.  Unlike scientific rationality, practical rationality \nrecognizes that accomplishing goals must encompass elements of common sense, \nexperiential knowledge and judgment (Townley, 2008: 215).  Practical rationality copes \nwith problems pragmatically based on what is possible given existing constraints rather \nthan exclusively relying on the logic of deductive science. Adopting pragmatism as a \nprocess would encourage more humility on the part of aid reformers regarding the \n 19 \neffective linkages between aid and development, and expand acceptance that the \nrobustness of the link may depend on the exercise of judgment and common sense within \nspecific situations.  Practical rationality would also suggest that aid radicals might give \ngreater consideration to which variety of capitalism might best tackle the root causes of \npoverty rather than the left\u2019s tendency to reject the notion of capitalist development \nentirely or the right's dogmatic faith in the false truths of neo-liberal prescriptions \n(Chang, 2010).   \n \nContingent practices:  Aid radicals are united in their assessment that aid fosters \nexcessive reliance of aid recipients on external assistance and limits the agency of \ncitizens. By re-configuring managerial aid practices so that they are both embedded in \nlocal realities and embodied in life experiences of those involved, it is possible to militate \nagainst the problems of dependency and disempowerment.  Reducing the physical and \npsychological spaces between developers and those for whom development is sought by \nreducing remuneration differentials and recruitment criteria also illustrate how contingent \napproaches could transcend the disembodied nature of managerial aid practices.  \nParticipatory methods are a tentative step in this direction, though constant attention is \nneeded to ensure these methods themselves do not become universal prescriptions to the \nproblem of abstraction and reification in aid that reduces the transformative potential of \nparticipation (Cooke, 2003, Hickey and Mohan, 2004).   \n \nCivic values: To the extent that the aid industry has become a self-perpetuating \none premised as it is on the continuation of poverty and under-development in order to \njustify its existence and its interventions, there has been a perversion of the democratic \nethos and humanistic values originally intended as the inspiration of and motivation for \nforeign aid. Professionalization of the aid sector into a sizable industrial complex has \nprivileged managerial values of efficiency and impartiality at the expense of civic \norientations and moral purposes.  This turn of events is not unique to foreign aid; \nincreasingly modern public administration is sacrificing the social meaning of the ends \nfor the technical efficiency of the means (Parkin, 1994: 112, Edwards, 1998, Pollitt, \n1990, Pollitt, 1997). The future of aid must consider re-introducing public service \n 20 \norientations among aid professionals that challenge the instinct of self-preservation. \nEffective aid is only likely to emerge by violating the tenets of economy and neutrality \nvia the principle of \u2018administrative activism\u2019 (Edwards, 1998: 570)). \n \nRe-theorizing foreign aid by centrally embracing contestability, commonsense, \ncontingency, civic-mindedness is a feasible vehicle for reconciling perspectives on The \nGreat Foreign Aid Debate.  But why is this search for integration of the radical and \nreformist perspectives desirable?  Why not let the radicals and reformers continue to \nwork at cross-purposes, either denouncing or celebrating aid with unnecessary \nexaggeration?   There are certainly normative reasons to want to see the backside of the \nGreat Aid Debate.  First, polarization of aid observers, researchers and practitioners split \nloyalties in such a way that limits the possibility for collective engagement across the \nradical-reformist schism.  This restrains prospects of building foreign aid into a \nmechanism and apparatus that both satisfies the moral imperatives that motivate aid- \ngiving and targets the root causes of under-development. Transcending this debate can \nraise awareness of the serious problems that afflict foreign aid and its techno-\nadministrative apparatus but not to the detriment of remedial actions and alternatives.  \nThe responsibility of radical critique demands the contemplation of solutions in order to \navoid complicity in maintaining the status quo of under-development (Corbridge, 1998, \nCorbridge, 2007).    A radically-reformist foreign aid is thus as desirable as it is possible. \n \n \nConclusions\t\r \u00a0\nThe dilemma that faces the future of aid involves reconciling radical pessimism \nconcerning foreign aid with reformers\u2019 optimistic managerial proverbs for aid \neffectiveness.   Arguably to have any productive future, aid needs to be both sensitive to \nexisting criticisms and concerns while still holding onto sensible possibilities for \n 21 \nintervention and improvement. Taking this on board requires building bridges across each \nside in the Great Aid debate and turning foreign aid into a \u2018radically-reformist\u2019 endeavor.  \nTo the extent that the future of aid is reframed as a radically-reformist \nengagement by which is meant one that is contested, commonsensical, contingent and \ncivically oriented, an end to the Great Aid Debate may be in sight.  Up until now, the \nexcessive pessimism of radicals and the unwarranted optimism of reformers has restricted \nattempts to pragmatically shift courses with foreign aid in directions that stand a chance \nof achieving greater effectiveness as defined by both reformers and radicals. Too much \naid criticism, however warranted, has done nothing to address the status quo for the \nbottom billion that is both real and immediate. Too much aid optimism has blinded us to \nstumbling blocks, instilled false hope and wasted resources. Rethinking foreign aid \nrequires reconsideration of a theory of aid and its administration better suited to taking on \nboard radical criticisms without giving up on the necessity for action and engagement \nupon which reformist arguments are predicated.  Foreign aid needs to be informed by \nboth a radical\u2019s sensitivity to aid\u2019s latent potential to do harm and a reformist\u2019s \nconviction in its potential to be made more effective. Minding, and then bridging, the gap \nbetween radicals and reformers is thus an important first step for moving towards a truly \nmore effective aid. \n \n 22 \nBibliography \nAcharya, A., Fuzzo de Lima, A.

See Martens, B. (2005) 'Why Do Aid Agencies Exist?', Development Policy Review, 23(6): \n643-663.  Nevertheless, since the bulk of ODA is handled via public sector institutions of government or \nwith government representation, namely bilateral and multilateral organizations, we understand the aid \nindustry to be comprised in the main by public agencies.    \niii The aid industry is not universally recognized as a cartel, however.  See Harford, T., Hadjimichael, B. \nand Klein, M. (2004) 'Aid Agency Competition', in World Bank Private Sector Development Vice \nPresidency (ed). Washington, DC. \niv For example, see Pieterse Nederveen, J. (2000) 'After post-development', Third World Quarterly, 21(2): \n175-191.. \nv Bill Easterly is unusual to the extent that he cam be considered as both an aid radical and an aid reformer. \nThis perhaps demarcates an evolution in his thinking more than an attempt to bridge the divide per se.   \nSome, however, read Easterly\u2019s book as offering \u201c no intervention\u201d possibilities.  See Unsworth, S. (2009) \n'What's Politics Got to Do With It?: Why donors find it so hard to come to terms with politics, and why this \nmatters', Journal of International Development, 21: 883-894. \nvi NPM is but one managerial school of thought, albeit a significant one. NPM underlines elaborate \nperformance management systems, outsourcing to quasi-autonomous agencies, self-regulation, customer \norientations and total quality management. See Pollitt, C. (1997) 'Managerialism Revisited', in Peters, B. G. \nand Savoie, D. (eds) Taking Stock: Assessing Public Sector Reforms. Montreal, McGill-Queens University \nPress.  \nvii The list of eligible potential crises is long and can include terrorism, hunger and disease, financial \ndistress, natural disasters, pandemics, genocide and environmental degradation.  This is not to say that these \nare not alarming global problems that need to be addressed but rather that the magnitude and scope of crisis \nis strategically presented to justify aid and its reform in the image of corporations as morally inevitable and \nuncontestable.
