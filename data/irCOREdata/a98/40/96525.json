Introduction\nThe avascular stage of tumour growth is characterised by small tumours which gain the nutrients and oxygen\nthey need for survival and growth by diffusion in from external blood vessels. Since there are no blood vessels\nwithin the tumour to supply the mass needed for such volume expansion, this must also enter through the\ntumour\u2019s periphery.\nAvascular tumour growth has been widely studied using mathematical techniques, and the resulting\nmodels are becoming increasingly sophisticated. For example, in an early paper [16], Greenspan presented a\ncompartmentalised model in which the tumour was divided into proliferating and quiescent regions. Recently,\nWard and King incorporated more realistic functional forms for the cell birth and death rates, which depend\non the local oxygen tension in the tumour tissue [28,29]. They also distinguished between live and dead\ncell populations. A common feature of the models presented in [17,28,29] is that low oxygen tensions are\nresponsible for generating substantial cell death, and for the resulting formation of areas of necrosis within the\ntumours. Landman and Please [22] propose an alternative mechanism for the formation of regions of necrosis.\nThey view the tumour as a two-phase mixture of cells and water, each phase having a different pressure. In\nviable regions of the tumour, where cells proliferate, the cell volume fraction is taken to be constant and the\ncell pressure is assumed to exceed the water pressure \u2013 the cells are compacted and pressure is transmitted\nfrom cell-to-cell. They assume that \u201cnecrotic\u201d regions form when the pressures in the two phases become\nequal and the cells are no longer compacted. This hypothesis has yet to be demonstrated experimentally.\nC. J. W. Breward e-mail: breward@maths.ox.ac.uk, C. E.

OX1 3LB\nKey words: Two-phase modelling; tumour growth; avascular; cellular viscosity; cell-cell stresses; numerical solution\n2 C. J. W. Breward et al.\nDe Angelis and Preziosi [10] relax the assumption that the cell volume fraction in the viable region of the\ntumour be constant and develop an alternative approach in which cells are assumed to attract each other\nwhen the cell volume fraction is below a threshold value and to repel each other when this value is exceeded.\nIn this paper we generate a new mathematical model for the development of an avascular tumour which\nincorporates a number of the phenomena introduced in the papers described above. As in [22], we view\nthe tumour as a two-phase material, consisting of tumour cells and extracellular water. Note that there are\nother phases present in avasular tumours; we discuss the formation of three-phase models which incorporate,\nfor example, extracellular matrix, in the discussion. We also assume that necrosis is initiated by low oxygen\ntensions, following [28,29]. We assume that there is internal conservation of mass, and that changes in tumour\nvolume are due to the in-flow of liquid across the tumour boundary: this fluid is taken up by cells which are\ngrowing and undergoing mitosis. We suppose that the behaviour of the cellular phase is similar to that of a\nviscous fluid, the viscosity indicating the degree of differentiation of the tumour cells: poorly differentiated\ntumours (i.e. the most aggressive tumours) are characterised by less intercellular cohesion and are thus \u201cless\nviscous\u201d than their well-differentiated counterparts, see [13,23].\nOur final key assumption is that the pressure in the cellular phase differs from that in the extracellular\nwater phase due to interactions between the cells. Rather than fixing the cell volume fraction, we adopt a\nsimilar approach to [6,7,10] and allow cells to attract or repel each other, depending on their local volume\nfraction. We associate cellular attraction with overlapping filopodia, and cellular repulsion with the relief of\nmechanical stress caused by deformation of the cellular membrane.\nOur model has its foundations in two-phase flow models, and, as such, follows the approach taken by\nFitt et al. [12]. However, our model allows for matter to change phase due to cell birth and death and, as\nsuch, differs from the numerous two-phase models that are used to describe nonbiological applications, in\nwhich there is no internal phase generation. For simplicity, we formulate our model in a one-dimensional\n(cartesian) geometry. All the equations and boundary conditions in our model could be easily replaced\nwith their radially-symmetric or fully three dimensional counterparts. We expect that the results obtained\nfrom analysing our one-dimensional model would be qualitatively similar to those obtained using a more\ncomplicated geometry. We formulate conservation of mass and momentum equations for the two phases, and\na diffusion-consumption equation to describe the oxygen tension within the tumour mass (we focus on the\noxygen tension rather than any other nutrients, assuming that it is the single, rate-limiting nutrient within\nthe tumour volume). We close the model equations by specifying appropriate constitutive laws. The first\nlaw states that there are no voids within the tumour, and the second describes the way in which cell-cell\ninteractions influence the pressure in the cell phase.\nOur model provides us with predictions for the effects of varying the cellular viscosity (i.e. the differentia-\ntion status of the tumour cells), the interphase drag (which we correlate with the viscosity of the extracellular\nwater) and the membrane tension. We are also able to justify the use of diffusion-like equations describing\ntumour growth: our cell-cell interactions manifest themselves as a nonlinear diffusivity, in the limit as viscous\neffects are neglected. The modelling strategy described in this paper also provides a framework for easily\nincorporating stress-dependent cell-proliferation and death terms. All these insights are discussed in the text\nor in section 6.\nThroughout this paper we avoid identifying the actual magnitude of the physical parameters. This is\nbecause we are interested in generating a generic model that can then be used (in various subforms) to\ndescribe the growth of a wide variety of tumour cell lines. Also, to our knowledge, no complete set of data\nexists for any specific cell line, and we believe that it would be inconsistent to quote an incomplete set of\ndata.\nOur underlying aim for generating the model presented in this paper is to use it as a building block for\nproducing a model that describes vascular tumour growth, that is, the late stage of growth in which the\ntumour has aquired its own blood supply. Such models will be useful for studying vascular tumour growth\nboth at the microscale and at the macroscale. At the microscale, we are concerned with interactions between\na single, compliant blood vessel and the tumour cells that it supplies with nutrients (see [2,21]); at the\nmacroscale, we are concerned with predicting how the tumour as a whole grows (see [4,18]).\nIn section 2 we formulate our mathematical model, which describes the evolution of the tumour. In\nsection 3 we explain how the model may be simplified and nondimensionalise the governing equations,\nbefore discussing the behaviour of the tumour near its outer boundary. In section 4 we present numerical\nsimulations of the model equations for several parameter regimes of physical interest. We analyse the initial\nThe role of cell-cell interactions in a two-phase model for avascular tumour growth 3\ngrowth of the tumour in section 5.1 before considering whether the tumour evolves to a steady state in\nsection 5.2. We analyse the model for the case in which oxygen levels are uniformly high within the tumour\nin section 5.3. Finally we present our conclusions and a discussion in section 6.\n2. Mathematical model\nWe denote the volume fractions of tumour cells and extracellular water by \u03b1 and \u03b2. We formulate conservation\nof mass equations under the assumption that each phase has the same density. This is a reasonable assumption\nin a two-phase model, since we assume that cells are built from the extracellular water, and that the products\nof cell death are extracellular water. We denote by x and t the independent variables and write\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(uc\u03b1) = qc and\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(uw\u03b2) = qw. (1)\nIn equations (1), uc is the speed with which the tumour cells move, uw the speed with which the water phase\nmoves, qc represents the rate of change of tumour cell volume due to cell birth and death, and qw represents\nthe complementary rate of change of extracellular water volume due to cell birth and death. We assume that\nthere are no voids and so we set\n\u03b1+ \u03b2 = 1. (2)\nWe further assume that momentum is conserved. Denoting the stresses in the cellular and extracellular\nphases by \u03c3c and \u03c3w, and neglecting inertia (we may check, a posteriori, that the Reynolds number for the\nflow, Re = \u03c1LU\/\u00b5c \u223c 10\u22122 and, hence, that inertial effects are indeed negligible), we write\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\u03b1\u03c3c) + fc = 0 and\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\u03b2\u03c3w) + fw = 0. (3)\nIn equations (3), fc and fw represent the net sources of momentum in each phase.\nFinally, we assume that oxygen transport through the tumour is controlled by diffusion [2], and the\nquasi-steady equation for the oxygen tension C(x, t) reads\n\u22022C\n\u2202x2\n= Qc, (4)\nwhere Qc represents the rate of oxygen consumption by the tumour cells.\n2.1. Constitutive laws\nVolume source terms\nIn an arbitrary control volume within an avascular tumour, volume cannot be created: rather it is exchanged\nbetween the extracellular and cellular phases. Thus we set qw = \u2212qc and choose qc to be consistent with\n[29]:\nqc =\n\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03b1)S0C\n1 + S1C\n\u2212 S2 + S3C\n1 + S4C\n\u03b1. (5)\nThe first term in (5) represents cell growth due to mitosis, characterised by the parameters S0 and S1, and\nthe second represents cell death, parameterised by S2, S3 and S4. We assume throughout the paper that\nS2 < S3\/S4. We note that the rate of cell growth increases with C and that, with the restriction on S2 given\nabove, the rate of cell death increases as C decreases (this is in line with experimental observations, [20]).\nWe do not distinguish different mechanisms of cell death (for example, apoptosis and necrosis); we assume\nboth effects are accounted for in our generic death term.\nStress tensors\nWe suppose that the stresses in the water and cell phases are given by\n\u03c3w = \u2212pw and \u03c3c = \u2212pc + 2\u00b5c \u2202uc\n\u2202x\n. (6)\n4 C. J. W. Breward et al.\nIn equations (6), pw and pc are the average pressures in the water and cellular phases respectively and \u00b5c\nrepresents the viscosity of the cells. Recall from the introduction that we associate the viscosity of the cellular\nphase with the degree of differentiation of the tumour cells. Well-differentiated tumours are characterised by\nsignificant levels of inter-cellular cohesion (as compared to poorly-differentiated tumours) and thus are have\na higher viscosity. In order to close the model equations we specify the following constitutive relationship\nbetween the two pressures:\npc = pw +\u03a3c, (7)\nwhere \u03a3c describes the pressure in the cell phase due to cell-cell interactions. We suppose that there is a\ncertain volume fraction of cells, \u03b1\u2217 say, at which the cells are at their natural, close-packing density. At higher\nvolume fractions, the cells\u2019 membranes deform and the cells experience stress. This pressure becomes infinite\nas the cell volume fraction approaches \u03b1 = 1. Under such conditions (when \u03b1 > \u03b1\u2217), the cells will attempt\nto move in order to reduce their stress. If \u03b1 < \u03b1\u2217 and the cells are close enough, the filopodia that they\nextend may come into contact and stimulate the motion of the cells towards each other, i.e. cell aggregation.\nThis is a short-range phenomenon; if the cells are too far apart (\u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1min say), they will not experience\nthis attraction. Note that \u03b1min \u2264 \u03b1\u2217, with equality holding in the case where there are no short-range forces\npresent between cells. Combining these ideas, we choose the following functional form for \u03a3c:\n\u03a3c =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\u03b3\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2 if \u03b1 > \u03b1min,\n0 if \u03b1 < \u03b1min.\n(8)\nIn (8), we call \u03b3 the tension constant. It is a measure of the cells\u2019 affinity for the natural density, \u03b1 = \u03b1\u2217.\nMomentum source terms\nWe suppose that there are momentum sources due to the interfacial pressures and that differential movement\nof the two phases manifests itself as a Darcy-style drag term. We set\nfc = pw\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202x\n+ k1\u03b1\u03b2(uw \u2212 uc) and fw = pw \u2202\u03b2\n\u2202x\n\u2212 k1\u03b1\u03b2(uw \u2212 uc). (9)\nIn (9) k1 is the drag coefficient, which is proportional to the viscosity of the extracellular water. We note that\nadditional terms could be included to describe, for example, the change in momentum associated with mass\ntransfer between the two phases [6]. We discuss introducing such terms in Section 6. We have assumed that\nthe drag terms are proportional to the product \u03b1\u03b2 (i.e. there is no drag if either species is not present). Other\npermeabilities may be more physically realistic (for example, we could use the Carman-Kozeny relationship\npresented in [14]). However, we proceed with our form for the drag because we believe it is the simplest\npossible form.\nOxygen consumption rate\nFor consistency with [3,30], we suppose that the oxygen consumption rate is governed by a Michaelis-Menten\nlaw [11], and thus we set\nQc =\nQ0\u03b1C\n1 +Q1C\n, (10)\nwhere Q0 and Q1 are positive constants.\n2.2. Initial and boundary conditions\nWe suppose that the width of the tumour l(t) and the initial volume fraction of the cells are known, so that\nl = L0 and \u03b1 = \u03b10 at t = 0. (11)\nWe assume symmetry about the tumour centre, so that\nuc = uw = 0 at x = 0, (12)\n\u2202C\n\u2202x\n= 0 at x = 0. (13)\nThe role of cell-cell interactions in a two-phase model for avascular tumour growth 5\nAt the tumour boundary, we assume continuity of stress, and we allow the free passage of water. Neglecting\nthe medium outside the tumour, we therefore have\npw = 0, 2\u00b5c\n\u2202uc\n\u2202x\n=\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\u03b3\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2 if \u03b1 > \u03b1min,\n0 if \u03b1 < \u03b1min.\nat x = l (14)\nWe also assume that the tumour\u2019s outer boundary moves at the same speed as the tumour cells on the\nboundary and so we fix\ndl\ndt\n= uc|x=l. (15)\nFinally, we assume that the oxygen tension outside the tumour is constant, and thus we set\nC = Cout at x = l. (16)\nIn summary, our model consists of the conservation of mass equations (1), with sources given by (5), the\nno-voids condition (2), the conservation of momentum equations (3), with stresses defined in (6) and sources\ndefined in (9), the constitutive relationship given in (7), the oxygen tension equation (4) with consumption\nrate given by (10), and the initial and boundary conditions given in (11\u201316). We note that the model\ncomprises seven equations for the seven unknowns \u03b1, \u03b2, uc, uw, pc, pw and C. In the next section we show\nhow the model may be reduced to three equations for \u03b1, uc and C.\n3. Model simplification\nIn this section we reduce the model to a trio of equations for \u03b1, uc and C. First we add equations (1), to\nobtain\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\u03b1uc + (1\u2212 \u03b1)uw) = 0, (17)\nwhich we may integrate to obtain\nuw = \u2212 \u03b1uc\n1\u2212 \u03b1, (18)\nimposition of (12) indicating that the constant of integration be set to zero. Similarly, adding equations (3),\nand substituting for the stress in each phase using (6), we find that\n\u03b3\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)\n)\n+\n\u2202pw\n\u2202x\n= 2\u00b5c\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03b1\n\u2202uc\n\u2202x\n)\n. (19)\nWe use the second of equations (3) and (18) to obtain a relationship between pw and uc:\nuc =\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)\nk1\u03b1\n\u2202pw\n\u2202x\n. (20)\nWe substitute from (20) into (19) to obtain\n\u03b3\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)\n)\n+\nk1\u03b1uc\n1\u2212 \u03b1 = 2\u00b5c\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03b1\n\u2202uc\n\u2202x\n)\n. (21)\nOur reduced model may now be stated as comprising the first of equations (1) coupled with equations (4)\nand (19), with boundary and initial conditions specified by (11\u201316).\n6 C. J. W.

Change of variables\nBefore carrying out the numerical solutions, it is convenient to map the domain of interest onto a fixed\ndomain.

(35)\nBefore presenting numerical simulations of the model equations, there are several points to note. In the\ncase where viscous effects are negligible, \u00b5\u2192 0 and the stress equation (30) reveals that\nuc = \u22121\u2212 \u03b1\nkl\u03b1\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03be\n(\n\u03b1(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2 H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)\n)\n. (36)\nSubstituting with (36) in (29) we deduce\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03c4\n=\n1\nkl2\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03be\n[\n(1\u2212 \u03b1) \u2202\n\u2202\u03be\n(\n\u03b1(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2 H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)\n)]\n+\n\u03be\nl\ndl\nd\u03c4\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03be\n+\n(\n(1 + s1)\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03b1)C\n1 + s1C\n\u2212 s2 + s3C\n1 + s4C\n\u03b1\n)\n,\n(37)\nwith\n\u03b1 = \u03b10, l = 1 at \u03c4 = 0, (38)\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03be\n= 0 at \u03be = 0, (39)\n\u03b1 = \u03b1\u2217 at \u03be = 1, (40)\ndl\nd\u03c4\n=\n1\nkl(1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03be\nat \u03be = 1. (41)\nThus, in the limit as \u00b5 \u2192 0 the problem reduces to a nonlinear diffusion equation for the tumour cell\nvolume fraction, \u03b1. Such equations have been proposed by other authors to describe tumour growth (see,\nfor example, [15,25,26]). Whereas Sherratt, Gatenby and others used nonlinear diffusion equations as the\nstarting point for their modelling and analysis, we have presented a systematic argument, based on cellular\nbehaviour, which justifies their description of cellular motion as a diffusion process. Note that, while equation\n(30) is formally singular in the limit \u00b5 \u2192 0, no boundary layer is formed because we are fortunate enough\nto still be able to satisfy all the boundary conditions in this limit.\nBy relaxing the assumption that viscous effects are negligible, so that \u00b5 > 0, we can generate a differential\nequation for A(\u03c4) = \u03b1(l(\u03c4), \u03c4):\n\u2202A\n\u2202\u03c4\n+\nA\n\u00b5\n(\n(A\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)H(A\u2212 \u03b1min)\n(1\u2212A)2\n)\n= A(1\u2212 s5 \u2212A), (42)\nwhere s5 = (s2 + s3)\/(1 + s4). Note that s5 denotes the ratio of the tumour cell death rate to the tumour\ncell birth rate that occurs when the oxygen tension is at the externally supplied level, (i.e. when C = Cout).\nIn Figure 1 we sketch A(\u03c4) as \u03c4 varies for different choices of \u00b5 and fixed values of s5 and A(0). From these\nresults we note that as the cells become more viscous (i.e. as \u00b5 increases) the time taken for A to reach its\nsteady state increases. Also, we see that, for all parameter values considered, A has attained its steady state\nby time \u03c4 = 1. Now, the steady state, As = A(\u03c4 \u2192\u221e), satisfies\nAs = 0, or\n1\n\u00b5\n(As \u2212 \u03b1\u2217)\n(1\u2212As)2 H(As \u2212 \u03b1min) = 1\u2212 s5 \u2212As. (43)\nIf 1\u2212 s5 < \u03b1min, then As = 1\u2212 s5 whereas if 1\u2212 s5 > \u03b1min, then As > \u03b1min solves\n0 = \u00b5(1\u2212As)3 \u2212 \u00b5s5(1\u2212As)2 + (1\u2212As) + \u03b1\u2217.\n8 C. J. W. Breward et al.\nFigures 1 and 2 near here\nIn Figure 2 we plot the physically relevant root of the above cubic as \u00b5 varies, for fixed values of s5. We note\nthat if 1\u2212 s5 > \u03b1\u2217 then As > \u03b1\u2217 so that the cells at the tumour\u2019s edge are in a stressed state, and we expect\nthe tumour to grow. From (43) we deduce that As \u2192 \u03b1\u2217 as \u00b5 \u2192 0, and As \u2192 1 \u2212 s5 as \u00b5 \u2192 \u221e. Further,\nwhen s5 = 1\/11 and \u00b5 = 1, we find that As = 0.804, and, so, As \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u001c 1. In the limit s5 \u223c 1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217, we\nconsider the expansion As = \u03b1\n\u2217 + \u000fA\u00af, where \u000f = 1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u2212 s5. Substituting this form into (43), we find that\n\u000fA\u00af\n\u00b5(1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u2212 \u000fA\u00af)2 = \u000f(1\u2212 A\u00af) \u21d2 A\u00af =\n\u00b5(1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)2\n1 + \u00b5(1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)2 +O(\u000f). (44)\nWe can use the relationship for As in (34) to determine \u2202uc\/\u2202\u03be at \u03be = 1:\n\u2202uc\n\u2202\u03be\n(\u03be = 1, \u03c4) \u223c \u000fl\n1 + \u00b5(1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)2 +O(\u000f\n2). (45)\nThus, since we know, from the simulations presented in Figure 1, that A approaches its steady state by\n\u03c4 \u223c 1, when studying the longtime behaviour of the system it is appropriate to scale uc = \u000fu and \u03c4 = T\/\u000f:\nthis scaling ensures a nontrivial balance in (35).\nIn the case where we neglect drag (i.e. k \u2192 0), which corresponds to the situation where the cells are\nnot affected by the flow of extracellular water between them, spatial variations in the water pressure become\nnegligible and the model reduces to a single equation for \u03b1: we integrate (30) twice to find that\nuc =\nl\n\u00b5\n\u222b \u03be\n0\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)ds. (46)\nSubstituting (46) into (29) we find that\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03c4\n+\n\u03b1\n\u00b5\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min) +\n1\n\u00b5\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03be\n\u222b \u03be\n0\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)ds\u2212\n\u03be\nl\ndl\nd\u03c4\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202\u03be\n=\n(\n(1 + s1)\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03b1)C\n1 + s1C\n\u2212 s2 + s3C\n1 + s4C\n\u03b1\n)\n. (47)\nThe initial and boundary conditions read\n\u03b1 = \u03b10, l = 1 at \u03c4 = 0, (48)\n\u03b1 = A at \u03be = 1, (49)\ndl\nd\u03c4\n=\nl\n\u00b5\n\u222b 1\n0\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)ds at \u03be = 1. (50)\nThus, in the limit k \u2192 0, the problem reduces to a non-local, integro-differential equation for the tumour\ncell volume fraction, \u03b1. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a model has been proposed to describe\ntumour growth.\nIn the case where both viscous effects and the drag are negligible (i.e. \u00b5 \u2192 0, k \u2192 0), the momentum\nbalance equation (30) predicts that the tumour cell volume fraction is constant, and equal to \u03b1\u2217, from the\nboundary conditions. Equation (29) then defines the speed with which the tumour cells move:\n\u2202uc\n\u2202\u03be\n= l\n(\n(1 + s1)(1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)C\n1 + s1C\n\u2212 s2 + s3C\n1 + s4C\n)\n. (51)\nIn (51), the evolution of l is governed by (35) so that\ndl\nd\u03c4\n= uc|\u03be=1 = l\n\u222b 1\n0\n{\n(1 + s1)(1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)C\n1 + s1C\n\u2212 s2 + s3C\n1 + s4C\n}\nd\u03be.\nThus, in the limit as k, \u00b5 \u2192 0, our model describes a situation in which \u03b1 is constant and the tumour\u2019s\ngrowth rate depends on the oxygen distribution. This reduced model is similar in form to models presented\nby Greenspan [16] and Landman and Please [22].\nThe role of cell-cell interactions in a two-phase model for avascular tumour growth 9\nFinally, we note that in the limit in which the (dimensional) tension constant \u03b3 is negligible, (i.e. \u00b5, k \u2192\n\u221e), condition (34) reduces to uc\u03be = 0, and the solution to (30), (33), (34) and (35) is uc = 0, l = 1. In this\ncase, the tumour does not grow and (29) reduces to an ordinary differential equation that describes how\nmass is exchanged between the cellular and extracellular phases, until the volume fraction is such that the\ncells experience repulsive forces and the tumour can increase in size.\n4. Numerical simulations\nIn this section we present numerical simulations of equations (29)-(35), scaled so that we use u and T rather\nthan uc and \u03c4 (as described in the last section), in several parameter regimes. Our aims are to determine\nthe general behaviour of the model equations and to see how varying two key model parameters, namely the\nviscosity constant and the drag constant, affects the tumour\u2019s growth.\nIn the absence of a complete set of parameter values, we focus on the qualitative nature of the model\nequations and pick the following values of the parameters:\nQ = 0.5, Q\u02c61 = 0, s1 = s4 = 10, s2 = s3 = 0.5,\nk = 1 = \u00b5 = 1, \u03b10 = \u03b1min = \u03b1\n\u2217 = 0.8.\nWe have taken \u03b1\u2217 = \u03b1min so that the effects of cellular attraction are not included in this simulation. We\nshow how \u03b1, u and l evolve over time in Figures 3a, b and c respectively. We find that, initially, the tumour\ncell volume fraction \u03b1 increases towards the centre of the tumour (results not shown, but see Section 7 for\nan explanation): the tumour can relieve the stress at its outer boundary by expanding outwards and, thus,\nreducing the volume fraction there. Following this early phase, the tumour becomes sufficiently large that\ncells at the centre start to die, so that a central necrotic core forms and \u03b1 there decreases. The system\nthen settles to a steady, travelling-wave solution, in which cells close to the edge of tumour move outwards\n(to relieve their stress), whilst cells nearer to the tumour centre move inwards. Figure 3c confirms that the\nsystem settles to a steady, travelling-wave profile: after an initial period of growth, the speed with which the\nleading edge of the tumour advances is approximately constant.\nFigure 3 about here\nIn Figure 4 we show how the size of the tumour changes over time, for different choices of the initial\nvolume fraction \u03b1(x, 0) = \u03b10. For \u03b10 < \u03b1min (= \u03b1\n\u2217 in this case), there is a \u201cwaiting time\u201d during which the\ntumour does not change in size but the tumour cell volume fraction increases to \u03b1\u2217 at the tumour\u2019s edge.\nFigure 4 about here\nThe results presented in Figure 5 show how the tumour\u2019s growth alters when the drag parameter k is\nchanged: as the drag coefficient increases the tumour\u2019s growth rate reduces. The drag parameter represents\nthe ease with which extracellular water may pass between the tumour cells. As this parameter is increased,\nthe extracellular water is less able to flow between the cells and hence the mass available for tumour cell\nproliferation diminishes.\nFigure 5 about here\nThe impact that changing the viscosity parameter \u00b5 has on the tumour\u2019s growth is depicted in Fig-\nure 6. We observe that as \u00b5 increases the tumour\u2019s growth rate reduces. The viscosity parameter represents\nthe amount of inter-cellular cohesion, which is high for well-differentiated tumours, and low for poorly-\ndifferentiated tumours. Increasing this parameter corresponds to stronger inter-cellular bonds.\n10 C. J. W. Breward et al.\nFigure 6 about here\nIn Figure 7 we investigate the effects of altering \u00b5 and k simultaneously, in a way that corresponds to\nchanging the tension constant \u03b3 (see definition of dimensionless parameter groups k and \u00b5 following equation\n(28)). Decreasing k and \u00b5 together (i.e. increasing \u03b3), increases the speed of tumour growth. The tension\nconstant corresponds to the affinity that the cells have for their natural volume fraction. As this parameter\nincreases, the cells move faster in order to try and regain the natural volume fraction. We discuss the physical\ninterpretations of these observations further in section 6.\nFigure 7 about here\nFinally we relax the assumption that \u03b1min = \u03b1\n\u2217 and consider the impact of fixing \u03b1min < \u03b1\u2217. Physically,\nthis means that the cells sense each other using their filopodia, and are attracted towards each other. When\n\u03b1min = 0.6, the system settles to a steady state. The resulting steady state profiles for \u03b1 and u, together\nwith the evolution of the tumour boundary l = l(T ), are presented in Figure 8. In this steady state, the\nmotion of the cells is everywhere inward, and the cellular volume fraction is significant everywhere. We do\nnot observe the formation of an area of necrosis.\nFigure 8 about here\n5. Analysis\nIn this section we present some analytical results which help to explain some of the behaviour observed\nin the last section. In particular, we derive an expression for the \u201cwaiting time\u201d depicted in Figure 4,\nnecessary conditions for the formation of a steady state solution, and we investigate oxygen-independent\ngrowth (corresponding to the initial growth of the tumour) for different limits of the cellular viscosity \u00b5.\n5.1. Transient analysis for tumours seeded below \u03b1min\nWhen \u03b1(\u03be, 0) = \u03b10 < \u03b1min, the solution to (30) is uc = 0. Equation (29) then reduces to a time-dependent\nordinary differential equation which describes the evolution of \u03b1 at each position x. The tumour will remain\nof size l = 1 until \u03c4 = \u03c4wait, at which time \u03b1(1, \u03c4) = \u03b1min. We may determine this \u201cwaiting time\u201d by solving\nthe differential equation for \u03b1(1, \u03c4). With uc = 0, equation (42) reduces to\n\u2202A\n\u2202\u03c4\n= A(1\u2212A\u2212 s5), A(0) = \u03b10, (52)\nwith solution\nA =\n(1\u2212 s5)\u03b10e(1\u2212s5)\u03c4\n1\u2212 s5 \u2212 \u03b10 \u2212 \u03b10e(1\u2212s5)\u03c4 . (53)\nThus, the waiting time, \u03c4wait, is given by\n\u03c4wait =\n1\n1\u2212 s5 log\n(\n\u03b1min(1\u2212 s5 \u2212 \u03b10)\n\u03b10(1\u2212 s5 \u2212 \u03b1min)\n)\n. (54)\nRemembering that T = (1\u2212s5\u2212\u03b1\u2217)\u03c4 , we show how the waiting time Twait varies with \u03b10 in Figure 9. There\nis good agreement between the analytical values and the numerical estimates of Figure 4.\nThe role of cell-cell interactions in a two-phase model for avascular tumour growth 11\nFigure 9 about here\n5.2. Necessary conditions for realising an equilibrium solution\nThe numerical results presented in Figure 8 suggest that, in certain parameter regimes, the system ultimately\nevolves to a steady state. We suppose that such a state is possible, and seek necessary conditions for realising\nequilibrium solutions. If a steady state occurs then uc = 0 at \u03be = 1. Integrating equation (34) and noting\nthat uc = 0 at \u03be = 0, 1, we deduce that a necessary condition for obtaining a steady state solution is:\u222b 1\n0\n{\n\u03b1(1\u2212 \u03b1)(1 + s1)C\n1 + s1C\n\u2212 s2 + s3C\n1 + s4C\n\u03b1\n}\nd\u03be = 0. (55)\nIntegrating equation (30) twice with respect to \u03be we find that a second necessary condition is:\u222b 1\n0\n\u03b1(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2 dx =\n\u222b 1\n0\nk\n\u03b1\n\u222b 1\n\u03be\n\u03b1uc\n1\u2212 \u03b1dydx. (56)\nSince uc \u2264 0 and 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1, we note that the integral on the right-hand-side (RHS) of (56) is non-positive\nand, for non-trivial solutions, it is negative. Since the RHS of (56) is non-zero, we deduce that \u03b1 > \u03b1min\nfor a finite range of points within the tumour volume. Since, for a nontrivial solution, the integrals in (56)\nare both negative, we deduce further that \u03b1\u2217 > \u03b1min is a necessary condition for obtaining a steady state\nsolution. We note that the numerical simulations presented in section 4 are consistent with these necessary\nconditions. The physical interpretation is that, in order for our tumour to reach a steady state, we must\nhave a region within the tumour where the cells are sparsely populated and short-range attractive forces are\nacting in order to balance the repulsive forces experienced in denser packed regions of the tumour.\n5.3. Analysis for initial stages of tumour growth\nIn this section we focus on equations (22)-(28) during the initial stages of avascular tumour growth, when all\ncells are well-oxygenated and, hence, proliferate at the maximal, oxygen-independent rate. The asymptotic\nlimit of interest has Q = Q\u02c61 = 0 (and, hence, C \u2261 1) and s2 = s3 = 0 (and, hence, no cell death). In what\nfollows, to simplify the analysis, we shall also assume that 0 < 1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u001c 1. Physically, this corresponds to\nthe case where, at the natural packing density, the tumour cells fill almost all of the available space within\nthe tumour.\nWe scale \u03b1, uc and t using similar scalings to those proposed at the end of section 3. Specifically, we write\n1\u2212 \u03b1 = \u000f\u03b8, uc = \u000fu, t = T\/\u000f, where 0 < \u000f = 1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217 \u001c 1.\nUnder these rescalings, equations (22) and (23) become\n\u2212\u000f \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202T\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n((1\u2212 \u000f\u03b8)u) = (1\u2212 \u000f\u03b8)\u03b8, (57)\n\u000f\u00b5\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n(1\u2212 \u000f\u03b8)\u2202u\n\u2202x\n)\n\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n(1\u2212 \u000f\u03b8) (1\u2212 \u03b8)\n\u000f\u03b82\n)\n= k\n1\u2212 \u000f\u03b8\n\u03b8\nu, (58)\nwith boundary conditions\nu = 0 at x = 0, (59)\n\u00b5\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n=\n(1\u2212 \u03b8)\n\u000f2\u03b82\nat x = l, (60)\ndl\ndT\n= u at x = l. (61)\nIf we introduce \u03bd = \u00b5\u000f2, \u03ba = k\u000f then equations (57) and (58) read (at leading-order in \u000f)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n= \u03b8, \u03bd\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n+\n(2\u2212 \u03b8)\n\u03b83\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x\n= \u03ba\nu\n\u03b8\n,\n12 C. J. W. Breward et al.\nand may be combined to yield a single equation for \u03b8:\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n((\n\u03bd\u03b8 +\n2\n\u03b82\n\u2212 1\n\u03b8\n)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x\n)\n= \u03ba\u03b8. (62)\nThe boundary conditions now read\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x\n= 0 at x = 0, (63)\n\u03bd\u03b8 =\n(1\u2212 \u03b8)\n\u03b82\nat x = l, (64)\ndl\ndT\n=\n1\n\u03ba\n(\n\u03bd\u03b8 +\n2\n\u03b82\n\u2212 1\n\u03b8\n)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x\nat x = l. (65)\nWe now investigate the behaviour of equations (62)-(65) for three limiting cases: (a) 0 < \u03bd \u001c 1, (b) \u03bd \u223c O(1)\nand (c) \u03bd \u001d 1. Case (a) corresponds to a situation in which the viscous effects are unimportant, and the\ntumour development is governed by drag and tension effects, case (b) corresponds to a situation in which\nviscous, tension and drag effects are all important, and case (c) corresponds to a situation in which viscous\neffects dominate.\n(a) Small \u03bd limit. When 0 < \u03bd \u001c 1, viscous effects can be neglected and the leading-order problem for \u03b8\nmay be integrated once by introducing \u2202\u03b8\/\u2202x = \u03d5(\u03b8)1\/2 and imposing (63). We find that\n\u03d5 =\n2\u03ba\u03b84\n(2\u2212 \u03b8)2 (2 log (\u03b8\/\u03b8\n\u2217) + (\u03b8\u2217 \u2212 \u03b8)) , (66)\nwhere \u03b8\u2217(T ) = \u03b8(0, T ). Referring to (64), we remark that, since 0 < \u03bd \u001c 1, \u03b8 = 1 at x = l and, so, (65)\nimplies that\n\u03ba\n(\ndl\ndT\n)2\n= \u22124 log \u03b8\u2217 \u2212 2(1\u2212 \u03b8\u2217). (67)\nUsing the solution for \u03d5 given above, we find that the (implicit) solution for \u03b8 reads\n\u221a\n2\u03bax =\n\u222b \u03b8\n\u03b8\u2217\n(2\u2212 s)ds\ns2\n\u221a\n2 log(s\/\u03b8\u2217)\u2212 (s\u2212 \u03b8\u2217) . (68)\nIt remains to determine the size of the tumour l and \u03b8\u2217. There are two equations for these two unknowns,\nnamely (67) and\n\u221a\n2\u03bal =\n\u222b 1\n\u03b8\u2217\n(2\u2212 s)ds\ns2\n\u221a\n2 log(s\/\u03b8\u2217)\u2212 (s\u2212 \u03b8\u2217) . (69)\nCombining these equations yields the following equation for \u03b8\u2217:\n\u2202\u03b8\u2217\n\u2202T\n= 2(\u22122 log \u03b8\u2217 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b8\u2217))\u03b8\u22172 + (\u22122 log \u03b8\u2217 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b8\u2217))1\/2\u03b8\u22172\n\u222b 1\/\u03b8\u2217\n1\n\u039b(r, \u03b8\u2217)dr (70)\nwhere\n\u039b(r, \u03b8\u2217) =\n16 log r \u2212 2(\u22125 + 5r + 2r log r)\u03b8\u2217 + 3(r \u2212 1)r\u03b8\u22172\n2r2\u03b8\u22173(\u22122 log r + (r \u2212 1)\u03b8\u2217)\u221a2 log r + \u03b8\u2217(1\u2212 r)dr. (71)\nIn practice, it is easier to solve (66) numerically, treating l as a parameter and identifying the value of \u03b8\u2217\nthat is consistent with the boundary conditions and this choice of l. The solutions for various values of l\nare presented in Figure 10. We see that, as the tumour grows, \u03b8 decreases internally and has a minimum\nat the centre of the tumour. Thus, as the tumour grows, the tumour cell volume fraction (\u03b1 = (1 \u2212 \u03b8)\/\u000f)\nincreases internally, and has a maximum at the centre. We can understand this behaviour by considering the\nThe role of cell-cell interactions in a two-phase model for avascular tumour growth 13\nfollowing argument. Cells throughout the tumour mass proliferate. In the vicinity of the boundary, there is\nless resistance to motion than in the centre and so the cellular volume fraction is lower near the boundary\nthan in the centre due to cell motion. The tumour mass expands because the cellular volume fraction exceeds\nthe natural packing density throughout, and hence the tumour grows in order to relieve this stress.\nWhen determining how l increases over time, there are two options: either we solve equation (70) to\nobtain \u03b8\u2217, or we use the value of \u03b8\u2217 = \u03b8\u2217(l) identified from the numerical solution described above. In both\ncases, we then use (67) to determine l. In practice, we write\u222b l\n1\nds\n(\u22122 log(\u03b8\u2217(s))\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b8\u2217(s)))1\/2 =\n\u221a\n2\n\u03ba\n\u03c4, (72)\nand use the second approach. The resulting growth curves for different choices of \u03ba are presented in Figure 11.\nThey show that increasing \u03ba retards tumour growth. Since \u03ba = \u000fk \u221d k1\/\u03b3, this corresponds to either\nincreasing the drag coefficient k1 or decreasing the tension constant \u03b3. Thus the qualitative behaviour of our\nreduced, oxygen-rich model is in good agreement with the numerical results of the full model presented in\nFigures 5 (k varies) and 7 (\u03b3 varies).\nFigures 10 and 11 here\n(b) \u03bd \u223c O(1). When \u03bd \u223c O(1), viscous, drag and tension effects are all important. As above, we substitute\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x = \u03d5(\u03b8)\n1\/2 into (62), and find that\n\u03d5 =\n2\u03ba\u03b84\n(2\u2212 \u03b8 + \u03bd\u03b83)2\n(\n2 log(\u03b8\/\u03b8\u2217)\u2212 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2217) + \u03bd\n3\n(\u03b83 \u2212 \u03b8\u22173)\n)\n. (73)\nUsing the boundary conditions at x = l, we find that the condition for lT reads\n\u03ba\n2\n(\ndl\ndT\n)2\n= 2 log(\u03b8l\/\u03b8\n\u2217)\u2212 (\u03b8l \u2212 \u03b8\u2217) + \u03bd\n3\n(\u03b83l \u2212 \u03b8\u22173), (74)\nwhere \u03b8l is the positive root of (64) which decreases monotonically with \u03bd.\nIn order to ascertain the effects of including viscosity, we compare \u03b8 for tumours of various size in Figure\n12, for \u03bd = 0 and \u03bd = 1. We fix \u03ba = 1 throughout these calculations. We see that, in each case, the viscosity\nlowers the value of \u03b8 throughout the tumour, but that, for large l, the difference between the viscous and\nnon-viscous cases is negligible except close to the advancing front. We show how the tumour size varies with\ntime in Figure 13. We see that the viscous term retards the tumour\u2019s growth, so that, again, the reduced,\noxygen-rich model exhibits the same qualitative behaviour as the full model (see Figure 6).\nFigures 12 and 13 near here\n(c) Large \u03bd limit. When \u03bd \u001d 1, viscous effects dominate drag and tension effects. We set \u03b4 = 1\/\u03bd \u001c 1, and\nthen the problem reads\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n((\n\u03b8 +\n\u03b4(2\u2212 \u03b8)\n\u03b82\n)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x\n)\n= \u03b4\u03ba\u03b8, (75)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x\n= 0 at x = 0, (76)\n\u03b83 = \u03b4(1\u2212 \u03b8) at x = l, (77)\n\u03b4\ndl\ndT\n=\n1\n\u03ba\n(\n\u03b8 +\n\u03b4(2\u2212 \u03b8)\n\u03b82\n)\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202x\nat x = l. (78)\n14 C. J. W. Breward et al.\nIn this limit, regardless of the size of \u03ba, the leading-order solution when we take \u03b4 \u2192 0 is\n\u03b8 = 0, l = 1. (79)\nIn the leading-order solution, the tumour mass consists entirely of cells, which cannot proliferate since there\nis no extracellular water present. The tumour therefore stays at a constant width.\nWe are forced to rescale \u03b8 so that \u03b8 6= 0 at x = 1. Using (77), we deduce that the appropriate scaling is\n\u03b8 = \u03b41\/3\u03c8, and the behaviour of the resulting model depends on the asymptotic size of \u03ba relative to \u03b4.\nIf \u03ba \u223c O(\u03b4\u22121\/3), then the drag term is negligible, and the solution to the problem reads\n\u03b8 = \u03bd\u22121\/3, l = 1. (80)\nIf \u03ba \u223c O(\u03b4\u22122\/3), we set K = \u03b42\/3\u03ba, and rescale time in order to retain the time-dependence in equation\n(78) (specifically, we fix T = \u03b4\u22121\/3T \u2032). As for the cases of small and O(1) viscosity, we are able to integrate\nthe resulting problem. If we set \u03d51\/2 = \u2202\u03c8\u2202x , then the equation for \u03d5 reads\n\u2202\u03d5\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2212 2(4\u2212 \u03c8\n3)\n\u03c8(2 + \u03c83)\n\u03d5 =\n2K\u03c83\n2 + \u03c83\n, (81)\nwhich has solution\n\u03d5 =\n2K\u03c84\n(2 + \u03c83)2\n(\n2 log(\u03c8\/\u03c8\u2217) +\n1\n3\n(\n\u03c83 \u2212 \u03c8\u22173\n))\n. (82)\nThe tumour\u2019s growth rate satisfies\nK\n2\n(\ndl\ndT \u2032\n)2\n= \u22122 log\u03c8\u2217 + 1\n3\n(\n1\u2212 \u03c8\u22173\n)\n. (83)\nWe comment that time has been rescaled to a long timescale T \u2032 = \u03b41\/3T . This indicates that the tumour\u2019s\ngrowth rate slows as \u00b5\u2192\u221e, a result which is consistent with the numerical results presented in Figure 6.\nAs a final remark, we note that, as the tumour gets larger, the effects of oxygen depletion become more\nimportant and the validity of our assumption that the tumour is nutrient-rich becomes less valid.\n6. Discussion\nIn this paper we have presented a new mathematical model that describes the growth of an avascular\ntumour. The model is based on a multiphase flow, and incorporates the effects of (i) cell proliferation and\ndeath changes that depend on the local oxygen tension, (ii) motion of the cells due to short range attraction\n(if the cells are sparsely populated) and repulsion (if the cells are overcrowded), (iii) the viscous nature of\nthe cells, (iv) drag forces caused by the motion of extracellular water through the gaps between the cells,\nand (v) changes in oxygen tension due to cellular consumption. Formulating the model in this way allows us\nto couple together mechanical and growth phenomena. For example, our framework could easily be used to\nstudy the effect of stress on cellular proliferation and death, as demonstrated experimentally in [9,19] and\nstudied in [7].\nWe were able to solve explicitly for the volume fraction of tumour cells on the tumour boundary and to\nshow that the tumour cell death rate was crucial in determining the behaviour of the advancing front. In\nparticular, if the death rate is less than a threshold value, then cells at the front are in a stressed state and\nwe predict that the tumour will expand in order to relieve this stress. We showed that a number of models\nfor tumour growth that exist in the literature may be recovered as special, limiting cases of our model. For\nexample, when viscous effects are neglected, the resulting model reduces to a nonlinear diffusion equation\nfor the cellular volume fraction (akin to the models presented by Sherratt [25,26] and Gatenby [15]). Thus,\nour model provides a justification for using nonlinear diffusion equations to describe tumour growth, and\nprovides an interpretation of the diffusivity in such models in terms of cell-cell interactions. Further, when\nboth viscosity and interphase drag were neglected, the model admitted solutions in which the cellular volume\nfraction was constant and the tumour\u2019s growth rate was regulated by the oxygen tension along. This reduced\nmodel is in line with models developed by Byrne and Chaplain [5], Greenspan [16] and Landman and Please\n[22].\nThe role of cell-cell interactions in a two-phase model for avascular tumour growth 15\nIn section 4 we presented numerical simulations of the model equations. We saw that, in the case where\nthe short-range, attractive force was inactive, the tumour developed a necrotic core, and the live cells were\nconfined to a thin region near the advancing front. Cells close to this front propagated outwards, while cells\ncloser to the centre migrated inwards. The system settled to a travelling wave with near constant speed\nof propagation. The distribution of live and dead cells within the tumour mass mirrors the actual spatial\nstructure observed in a multicell spheroid in vitro (see [24]), and also has the same features as the solutions\npresented in [28]. Tumours seeded below the natural packing density enjoyed a period of quiescence during\nwhich the overall size of the tumour remained fixed and the cell density increased to the natural packing\ndensity. Thereafter the tumour expanded, as normal. We were able to predict this waiting time and show how\nit depended on system parameters such as the initial cell density and the natural packing density. Whilst the\nexistence of waiting times in solid tumour growth remains to be investigated experimentally, we note that\nthis result may have important implications in tissue engineering [8]. Here pieces of tissue, such as cartilage,\nthat are needed to replace damaged or degraded tissue, are cultured in vitro by seeding the relevant cells\non a porous scaffold which is bathed in fluid and vital nutrients. We anticipate that in such circumstances\nthere may be an initial quiescent period, or waiting time, during which the seeded cells increase in number\nbut the colony size does not increase in size.\nBy performing a series of numerical simulations (with the short-range, attractive force switched off),\nwe investigated the impact that changing the model parameters had on the tumour\u2019s growth. We found\nthat increasing the drag parameter reduces the speed of tumour growth, increasing the viscosity parameter\nreduces the tumour growth, while increasing the tension constant increases the speed of tumour growth.\nOur prediction that increasing the drag parameter reduces the speed of tumour growth is consistent with\nthe interpretation that the drag represents the ease with which extracellular water may pass between the\ntumour cells, and correlates with the viscosity of the extracellular water (which, in this paper, comprises\nof water and necrotic debris). Increasing the drag increases the resistance to the motion of extracellular\nwater, and, in turn, this slows local growth of tumour cells due to lack of available building blocks. Our\nprediction that increasing the cellular viscosity decreases the speed of tumour growth is consistent with\nthe idea that cellular viscosity correlates with the degree of differentiation (and, hence, invasiveness) of the\ntumour cells, i.e. we predict that tumours containing well-differentiated cells grow more slowly than their\nless differentiated counterparts. Our prediction that the speed of tumour growth increases with increasing\nthe tension coefficient is consistent with the idea that the tension coefficient corresponds to the affinity of the\ncells to their natural volume fraction. Increasing the tension coefficient increases this affinity and increases\nthe speed with which the cells move in order to try and regain the natural volume fraction. This results in an\nincrease in the speed of expansion of the tumour when the cells proliferate. We suggest that experiments be\ncarried out to test these hypotheses. For example, to test whether increasing the extracellular drag decreases\ntumour growth, spheroids could be grown in vitro in liquids of different viscosities (since the viscosity of the\nextracellular water depends crucially on the viscosity of any external liquid source).\nWith the short-range, attractive force switched on, the tumour evolved to a steady state (with the\nparticular set of parameters chosen) in which cellular motion was always inward. In such a situation, there\nwas no mass flux across the free surface, and the mass required for the generation of new cells came completely\nfrom recycling old cells. No area of necrosis was generated in this case.\nWe analysed the model for the special case in which the tumour was rich in oxygen and the cells prolifer-\nated at their maximal, oxygen-independent rate. We expect that this case is relevant during the early stages\nof avascular growth, whilst the tumour is still small enough that all cells are well-nourished. With suitable\nchoices for the parameters, we were able to reduce the model to a quasi-steady limit. We found that the\nvolume fraction of tumour cells was highest in the centre of the tumour, which we attributed to proliferation\nand the inability of the cells near the centre to migrate. Further, increasing the drag coefficient decreased the\nspeed of tumour growth, as did increasing the viscosity. We also saw that increasing the viscosity increased\nthe cell volume fraction at the boundary, and throughout the tumour, for a given width. In the limit of large\nviscosity, we found that the tumour cells filled space, and that there was no growth in this case because there\nwas no extracellular water available to provide the building blocks for proliferation. The results of varying\nthe key parameters in the oxygen-rich model agree well with the results of the numerical solution of the full\nmodel, even though they are a valid approximation only when the tumour remains small.\nIn developing our two-phase model, we have employed the simplest forms for each of the mechanisms\nincluded. We could modify these relations to make them more realistic. For example, we could use the\n16 C. J. W. Breward et al.\nCarman-Kozeny relationship for the permeability (see [14]). This is an empirically determined relationship\nthat is used to describe the drag between water and sand grains that are nearly spherical, and captures the\neffect of the pore configuration. In this case,\nfc = pw\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202x\n+\nk1\u03b1\n2\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2 (uw \u2212 uc), (84)\nand the equation replacing (21) would read\n\u03b3\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\n((1\u2212 \u03b1)2H(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)\n)\n+\nk1\u03b1\n2uc\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)4 = 2\u00b5c\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03b1\n\u2202uc\n\u2202x\n)\n. (85)\nOur relationship for the cell-cell interaction term \u03a3c could also be modified to remove the jump in the\npressure at \u03b1 = \u03b1min. To do this, we would consider a \u03a3c of the form\n\u03a3c =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\u03b3\n(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u2217)(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1min)\n(1\u2212 \u03b1)2 if \u03b1 > \u03b1min,\n0 if \u03b1 < \u03b1min.\n(86)\nThese and other modifications to the functional forms that are used to describe the various phenomena in\nour model still result in a second-order equation for the cell velocity of the form\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nf1(\u03b1)\n\u2202uc\n\u2202x\n)\n= f2(\u03b1)uc + f3(\u03b1). (87)\nIn addition to providing a more physically-based description of avascular tumour growth, the model\npresented in this paper is a first step towards achieving a realistic model of vascular tumour growth. In order\nto do this, we plan to extend the existing model to include three phases: cells, extracellular water, and blood\nvessels. The modelling approach will follow directly from that presented herein; we merely require a further\nconstitutive law to close the system. Such a model will be valuable to both experimentalists and clinicians\nfor describing both the growth of vascular tumours in vivo and also for investigating the impact of therapies,\nincluding those that target the tumour\u2019s vasculature.\nThree phase models could also be used to provide more detailed descriptions of other aspects of solid\ntumour growth. For example, we could include the effects of macrophages, extracellular matrix or a second\npopulation of tumour cells. Further, the multiphase modelling approach described in this paper could be used\nto describe a variety of other interesting and biologically important situations in which mass changes phase,\nsuch as modelling the growth of tissue engineered cartilage, bone remodelling, and soft tissue growth (see [1,\n8,27] for examples of work that could be extended). In each case, the challenge of the modelling will be to\ncapture accurately the stress relationships observed physiologically, and to incorporate correct representations\nof the sources and sinks for both mass and momentum. We believe that these models represent the natural\nmodelling framework for mathematical study in these areas.\nAcknowledgements. We wish to acknowledge many helpful discussions with Dr P. D. Howell.
