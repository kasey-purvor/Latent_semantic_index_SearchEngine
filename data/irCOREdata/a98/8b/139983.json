Introduction \nIn recent years cost effective advanced composites reinforced with Non Crimp Fabrics \n(NCF) and braids have received increased attention as possible materials for automotive, \nand other, applications. The CEC funded Framework VI project TECABS [1], for example, \nhas recently combined both materials to successfully manufacture a large complex \nautomotive floor assembly using RTM technology. Within the TECABS project braids were \nused for automotive side sills and have also been used for main rails in production \nvehicles [2]. Braids can be efficiently manufactured using rotary braiding machines which \ncan be tailored to provide a wide variety of yarn architectures and preform shapes that are \nparticularly suitable for closed form sectional members. Furthermore, the availability of \nnew low cost carbon fibres and the use of flexible resin injection processes are helping to \nencourage industrial interest, particularly for low volume niche applications. \n \nThe particular class of composites considered here are carbon fibre reinforced braids for \nstructural applications. Experimental work has shown that these materials offer a good \ncompromise between mechanical performance, impact resistance and crash energy \nabsorption. Under axial crushing of sectional members it is well known that composites \ncan out perform metals for specific energy absorption [3]; braid reinforced composites are \nsimilarly competitive giving a two to three fold increase in specific energy absorption \ncompared to metals for axial crushing of tubular sections [4].  \n \nHowever, braid reinforced composites can also absorb significant specific energy under \ntensile loading; for example, Figure 1 compares a [\u00b145\u00b0] biaxial braid reinforced composite \n(67.2mm*1.6mm thick) and an automotive grade Aluminium 6014\/T6 coupon \n(65.0mm*1.7mm thick) loaded to failure. Despite the lower ultimate strength of the \ncomposite the ability of the fabric architecture to reorientate enables large strains and high \nlevels of energy to be absorbed over a much greater \u2018non-local\u2019 necking zone; Figure 2. In \nterms of specific energy absorption the 220 mm long braided composite achieves 9.16J\/g \ncompared to 4.16J\/g for the Aluminium coupon. This superior performance could be \nadvantageous in applications such as automotive side intrusion where large amounts of \nenergy must be absorbed. \n 3\nMost analytical constitutive models for advanced composites have been specifically \ndeveloped for unidirectional (UD) plies and a large number of failure models are to be \nfound in the literature [5]. Under impact and crash loading the limited models available, for \nexample [6,7] usually treat the progressive composite fracture process using \u2018continuum \ndamage mechanics\u2019 but, again, most models to date concern UD composites. The focus of \nthis paper is testing methods specific to the characterisation of braid reinforced composites \nand their representation in a meso- mechanical damage model suitable for impact and \ncrash simulation. In addition to braids, however, other more conventional composites will \nalso be used to introduce some specific features of the meso- mechanical damage law.  \n \n3. The meso- mechanical damage model \nThe Finite Element (FE) code used for this work is a commercial explicit code [8] which \nhas recently added new composite ply and delamination models based on damage \nmechanics [9]. For representation of each ply the original model proposed by Ladev\u00e8ze [6] \nfor UD composites is available and considers each elementary-ply at the macro- level as \nan orthotropic homogeneous material; continuum damage mechanics is used to treat \nstrength degradation and failure. The principle ply failure mechanisms are fibre failure due \nto longitudinal tension or compression loading, resin micro-cracking due to transverse \ntension and fibre-matrix debonding due to shear loading. These failure modes can develop \nindependently, or simultaneously, depending on the state of loading. The simplified plane \nstress orthotropic constitutive law with damage parameters is given by,  \n[ ]{ }\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\nS\ndG\ndEE\nEdE\n=\n\uf8f4\uf8fe\n\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n\uf8f4\uf8fe\n\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n12\n22\n11\n1212\n221\n21\n1\n12\n11\n12\n22\n11\n)1(\n100\n0\n)1(\n1\n0\n)1(\n1\n ,  (3.1) \nwhere the compliance matrix [S] comprises of four undamaged elastic constants E1, E2, \nG12 and \u03c512 and damage parameters d1, d2 and d12 for the two principle fibre and shear \ndirections. Usually d1 and d2 are uncoupled, but there can be an interaction between d2 and \nd12. The mechanical and damage properties in tension and compression may be different. \n \n 4\nThe constitutive damage law uses internal damage variables to control material stiffness \nreduction and also to define failure. These variables must be calibrated against \nappropriate coupon tests which include the principle fibre [0\u00b0] and transverse [90\u00b0] \ndirections under tension and compression, a shear test [\u00b145\u00b0] and an additional test \n[\u00b167.5\u00b0] designed to account for interaction of certain failure modes. The original Ladev\u00e8ze \nmodel [6] demonstrated parameter identification for UD composites T300\/914 and \nIM6\/914. Investigations by the authors have found that tensile and compressive aspects of \nthis model appear valid for a wide range of composite types; however, the shear response \nhas limitations and improvements are proposed in the following section.  \n \n3.1 Shear mechanical testing and parameter identification for a UD Composite \nThe following describes shear [\u00b145\u00b0] testing and parameter identification for a relatively \nductile high strength UD carbon fibre composite, T800S\/M21 manufactured by Hexcel [10]. \nThe shear response of this material exhibits large strain and non-linear damage \nevolvement to failure and is useful to illustrate limitations and improvements to the model. \nThe growth of shear damage is characterised using cyclic tensile testing on a [\u00b145\u00b0] \ncoupon; the damaged modulus at any instance is provided by the unloading modulus of \nthe shear stress-strain curve, Figure 3. The modulus must be determined from stress and \nstrain measures in the local lamina frame. The following expressions transform quantities \nbetween the loading frame (x,y) and the required local lamina frame (1,2).  \n \n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n\u2212==\n=\n,  )(2\n2\n1212\n12\nyx\nx\n\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5\u03b3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n (3-2)\n \nThe following identification of damage parameters follows the procedure outlined in [6] \nusing the results from Figure 3. At each cycle the elastic and plastic strain components are \navailable and are used to determine the damage and plasticity laws respectively. At least \n5-6 cycles are required to obtain a good evolution of damage and plasticity. \n \n \n 5\n \nThe damage law: The damaged shear modulus at each cycle is given by, \n,  \nG\nG1d 0\n12\n12\n12 \u2212=  (3-3)\nwhere G12 is the damaged modulus and G012 is the initial undamaged value.

Reference \n[6] assumes a linear relationship between these two quantities given by,  \n1201212 )( YdYdY iCi +=  , (3-5)\nfrom which the parameters CY12  and 120Y  for the linear damage law can be identified, \nFigure 4. A final damage constant RY12  denoting ultimate failure is found by specifying the \nmaximum damage value dsat in equation (3-5).  \n \n \nThe plasticity law: Parameters for the plasticity law are derived from the evolution of \nplastic strains at each cycle. The plasticity hardening function )(pR  is derived from (3-6) \nand (3-7). A fitting procedure is used to define a power law having three constants; \nnamely, the initial yield stress R0 and the hardening coefficients \u03b2 and \u03b1. \n0)(\n1\n),~( 0\n12\n12\n=\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\n= RpR\nd\nRf p\n\u03c3\n\u03c3  (3-6)\n\u222b \u2212=\np\npddp\n122\n0\n1212 )1(2\n\u03b5\n\u03b5  (3-7)\nThe shear damage and plasticity constants assuming a linear damage function are given \nin Table 1. \n \nIt is evident from Figure 4 that the original linear damage law proposed by Ladev\u00e8ze [6], \nequation (3.5), cannot represent the latter stages of damage and, in particular, the ultimate \n 6\nfailure condition. This nonlinear failure behaviour has been observed by the authors for a \nnumber of woven, Non Crimp, and braided composites which have relatively ductile \nmatrices and allow considerable fibre rotation in shear prior to failure. Consequently, \nalternative laws describing the evolution of 12Y and d12 are proposed as shown in Figure 4. \nThese are; namely, a linear, logarithmic and polynomial function of rank 2. The logarithmic \nfunction was previously proposed by Johnson and Pickett [11] for woven fabric \ncomposites.  \n \nFigure 5 shows the consequence of these three damage functions on the shear stress \nstrain relation. The linear function cannot represent the experimental trend and predicts \npremature failure; the logarithmic function gives an improved correlation, but clearly the \npolynomial function gives the best agreement and estimate for failure strain.  \n \n4. Braided composites \nMechanical properties for constitutive models to be used in Finite Element analysis are \nusually determined from appropriate regulatory tests; for example, the ASTM standards \nD3410\/D [12] and D3518\/D [13] for tensile and compression testing respectively. However, \nbraided composites do have some particular features that should be noted in the testing \nprogramme. First, most braided composites have a continuous architecture without free \nedges, whereas coupon testing is usually performed on specimens cut from flat panels \nand therefore having free edges. Second, in the case of multi-layer braids, there is a \nthickness effect that should be considered. Section 4.1 discusses the damage \nmechanisms that occur in biaxial braids under tensile loading. This is then followed by \nexperimental work to investigate the effects that free edges and the number of layers have \non composite mechanical properties. \n \n4.1 The damage mechanisms and fibre rotation \nFor biaxial [\u00b1\u03b8\u00b0] braids under tensile loading the damage development has been shown to \nbe nonlinear, Figure 4, and is due to matrix micro-cracking and plasticity associated with \nlarge fibre rotation. The fibre\/matrix interface progressively debonds allowing tows to align; \nthis scissor action continues until the tows reach a maximum interlocking angle and \nrupture, or the fibre start to fail due to the loss of integrity and the large shear strains. This \n 7\nbehaviour is illustrated in Figure 6 for a tensile loaded [\u00b145\u00b0]4s braid where significant fibre \nmatrix debonding and tow alignment has occurred leading to significant necking prior to \nfailure of the specimen.  \n \nDelamination between plies is a further damage mechanism that has been observed in \nmulti-layered braid composites, Figure 7. This damage mode is due to the shearing \ndeformation and is strongly coupled to the ply damage mechanism. This failure leads to \nseparation of the plies and will reduce the ability of the laminate to sustain bending loads. \nCharacterisation of this failure mode has not been treated here and will be investigated in \nfuture work. \n \n4.2 The edge effect: Cut and uncut coupons \nA test program was undertaken to determine the difference between mechanical \nproperties and failure for coupons having cut and uncut edges. The work used 40mm \ndiameter braids with 24K STS tows and 42 ends manufactured by Eurocarbon, the \nresin\/hardener was LY3505\/XB3403 from Huntsman Advanced Materials. All coupons \nwere manufactured using the VARI process which gave a fibre volume ratio of 53%. Two \nfabric architectures have been considered; namely, a [\u00b125]4S and a [\u00b145]4S braid.  \n \nThe tubular braids were carefully flattened in order to maintain the fabric architecture prior \nto impregnation. Figure 8 shows the flattening of the braids which were either cut after \ncuring, or left intact, to provide the two types of edge conditions. Due to the relatively \ncoarse architecture of the braid having a \u2018Repetitive Unit Cell\u2019 (RUC) of 14 mm square it \nwas decided to use test coupons of 65mm width; this is in line with reference [14] which \nrecommends that specimen width is at least three times the RUC to ensure a uniform \nstrain distribution. \n \nFor the [\u00b125]4S braided composite the cut and uncut coupons had identical initial \nmechanical properties (Eo); however, the uncut coupons showed significantly greater \nultimate load (+27.5%) and strain to failure (+39.1%) as shown in Figure 9. and Table 2. \nThe observed failure modes are also shown in Figure 9 and are similar for the two types of \nspecimens. The loss of tow continuity in the cut specimen leads to a combination of tow \n 8\npull-out and tow failure which initiate at the free edges; whereas, for the uncut specimen \ntow breakage initiates at the area of highest stress concentration adjacent to the tabs. \nA second study is presented in Figure 10 for the [\u00b145]4S cut and uncut braid reinforced \ncomposite. In this case a similar trend is observed to the previous [\u00b125]4S case, except that \nthe difference between cut and uncut strength is reduced to 13,3%. This is due to the \nincreased transfer of load by transverse matrix mechanisms rather than fibre mechanisms; \nthus the anchorage effect of the fibres at the edges is less significant. \n \nThis brief study indicates that braid angle strongly influences the strength between \u2018cut\u2019 \nand \u2018uncut\u2019 braid reinforced coupons. It shown that failure in biaxial \u2018open\u2019 braids, which \nare dominated by transverse matrix failure, does not greatly affect the failure strength \nusing the two edge conditions. Whereas for low angle braids the load transfer mechanisms \nare fibre dominated and the difference between \u2018cut\u2019 and \u2018uncut\u2019 edge condition is much \ngreater. The width of the coupon tested can also be expected to influence these trends. It \nmay be concluded that mechanical data obtained from cut coupons should be used with \ncaution for the FE analysis of closed sectional members. Conversely, cut edges in a \nbraided structure should have mechanical data obtained from corresponding \u2018cut\u2019 coupon \ntests. \n \nFigure 10 shows the damage development for the [\u00b145]4S coupons presented in Figure 10 \nwith cut and uncut edge conditions. It can be seen that both coupon types have similar \ndamage evolution, at least to the point where strain gauge measurements were possible at \nabout 5% strain.  \n \n \n4.3 Influence number of layers on composite strength for braids  \nA further variable that influences braid mechanical properties is the number of plies. \nLaminates having only a few plies tend to have distinct resin rich pockets between fabric \ntows, Figure 12. As additional plies are added these areas are displaced with tows from \nthe overlaid plies leading to greater material homogeneity. The affect on mechanical \nproperties is investigated for four [\u00b145\u00b0] braids having cut edges with 1, 2, 4 and 6 layers. \n \n 9\nCyclic loading has been applied to determine the damage and hardening laws for each lay \nup. Figure 13 shows that the number of plies does not appear to influence the damage \nlaw; however, it does have a significant effect on the hardening law, Figure 14. The \nhardening law shows that a single ply exhibits significantly more deformation compared to \nthe other layups probably due to the higher void content allowing greater freedom for fabric \ndeformation. For laminates with two or more plies the plasticity law starts to be consistent.  \nAgain, however, it must be noted that these observations are for test measurement \nconducted to only about 5% strain which was the limit of the strain gauges. It has also \nbeen observed that braids with low ply numbers are liable to fail at a slightly lower failure \nstrain, probably due to inconsistencies in the fabric architecture. \n \n5. Example for the loading of a braid reinforced beam \nFigure 15 shows the experimental test setup for the braid reinforced beam having \ndimensions 1100mm long by 60mm square cross section. The braided beam uses a \n[\u00b145\u00b0]4S architecture and the previously cited fibre and resin systems. Different braided \nbeams have been considered having alternative inner structures; for example an open \nsquare section and a 2*2 cell section as shown in Figure 16. In each case the beams have \nbeen loaded to failure under static four point bending.  \n \nResults for the beam study are presented in Figure 16 and compare the FE simulations \nusing linear and polynomial damage functions with test measurements. In this case a \npolynomial function of rank 3 has been used to capture the relationship between conjugate \nforces 12Y  and damage 12d ; the higher order polynomial is needed to capture the \nexperimental points ( 12Y , 12d ) and also allow rapid damage growth after damage \nsaturation is reached, this polynomial form is shown schematically in Figure 4. The linear \ndamage function predicts, as expected, premature failure of the beam, whereas the \nimproved polynomial function gives an encouraging agreements with test results. \n 10\n \n5. Conclusions  \nA meso-scale damage model has been adapted and presented for braid reinforced \ncomposites. Experiments have shown that biaxial braid reinforced composites can \nundergo large shear deformations and associated fibre rotations leading to a non-linear \nevolution of damage. Alternative shear damage laws have been proposed and a good \nagreement between test measurements and the law using a higher order polynomial \nfunction has been found. However, difficulties have been encountered to accurately \nmeasure strains the latter stages of shear deformations and further work will be needed to \nvalidate the model in this region. \n \nThe failure analysis of a braided composite structure requires correct interpretation of \ncoupon test measurements. Work has been presented showing the important effect that \nthe edge condition (cut or uncut) of a tensile coupon has on failure load. It has been shown \nthat uncut continuous braids give significantly greater strength and strain to failure and that \nthis is dependent on the braid angle. The influence of the number of plies is a further \nimportant material variable that must be taken into consideration in the parameter \nidentification process. A FE analysis of a braided composite beam has given encouraging \nagreement between test and simulation results using the new braid meso-scale damage \nmodel and mechanical data obtained from appropriate mechanical testing. \n \n \n6.
