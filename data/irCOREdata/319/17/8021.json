The Budongo Forest habitat consists of\nmoist semi-deciduous tropical forest, and contains a number of forest\ntypes, notably Cynometra Forest, Mixed Forest, Colonising Forest, and\nSwamp Forest [3]. The study community of chimpanzees is named\nthe Sonso community after the River Sonso which runs through its\nrange. At various places along the river, Swamp Forest prevails.\nSwamp Forest contains several Raphia farinifera palm trees. After a\nsingle flowering and fruiting, the trees of this species lose their foliage\nand die. The dead bole remains standing and is 15\u201330 ft high. The\nbole rots down until it consists of a hard outer bark with a soft, moist,\nfibrous woody pith. Chimpanzees make a small hole in bark at the\nbase of the dead tree with their teeth, widen it with their fingers and\nlater their hands. Through the hole, they extract dead pith, chew it\nthoroughly, swallow the juice and some particles of woody matter,\nand finally spit out a fibrous wadge of chewed pith. There is\nfrequently competition for Raphia pith. Eventually trees are\nabandoned, often with large holes and much inner pith removed\n(Fig. 1). Until now, the reason for consumption of the deadRaphia pith\nhas not been known.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the results of the chemical analysis expressed as mg\nper kg of dried material for each sample. In this table, results for\nelements for which no more than trace amounts were obtained have\nbeen omitted. With one exception (samples 7 and 8) samples were\nindependent of each other, coming from different trees or at\ndifferent collection dates. In the case of samples 7 and 8, sample 8\nwas a wadge (a spit-out chewed sample) of sample 7 and was omitted\nfrom the analysis. For purposes of analysis, the samples were placed\ninto two groups: Raphia pith (n= 10), and all other samples (n= 16).\nStatistical tests were done using SPSS version 7. Data were not\nnormally distributed (Lilliefors test p,0.000). Mean mineral\ncontents of the two groups were therefore compared using non-\nparametric Mann-Whitney U-tests. Results are shown in Table 2.\nAs can be seen from Table 2, significant differences between\ngroup means (Raphia vs. all other samples) were found for four of\nthe minerals tested, sodium, calcium, manganese and zinc. In the\ncase of calcium (p= 0.004), higher values occurred in the \u2018all other\nsamples\u2019 group and reflect the normal high level of calcium in\nleaves and fruits. In the case of sodium (p,0.000), manganese\n(p,0.006), and zinc (p= 0.007) higher values occurred in the\nRaphia group. Bark, leaves and fruits from other tree species did\nnot contain the high levels of sodium found in the Raphia samples.\nThese results are illustrated by box-plots (Fig. 2).\nDiscussion\nSince study of the Sonso community of chimpanzees began in\n1990, individuals and small parties of the animals have been seen\noccasionally eating the pith of dead Raphia trees, but until now the\nreason for doing so has not been known. The first report showing\nhigh levels of sodium in samples of dead wood eaten by apes was\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e6194\nthat of Rothman et al for mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in\nBwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda [4]. In that study it\nwas estimated that the sodium obtained from dead wood\nconstituted 95% of the sodium in the gorillas\u2019 diet. Using similar\nmethods to those employed here, a mean dry sodium weight of\n810.7 mg kg21, with a range of 100\u20131920 mg kg21 was mea-\nsured.. This compares with the mean dry sodium weight for\nRaphia samples in the present study of 5432 mg kg21, range\n1431\u201314616 mg kg21. Raphia palm trees in Budongo Forest\ntherefore offer higher concentrations of sodium to the chimpan-\nzees than dead wood does to the Bwindi gorillas.\nRothman et al found that sodium levels were significantly higher\nin dead wood than in other items in the diet [4], and this was also\nthe case in the present study. As they point out, sodium is an\nessential item of diet for apes, lack of which has wide-reaching\neffects on health [5]. In the Budongo Forest too, there appears to\nbe little sodium in the other plant parts eaten and tested here\n(bark, leaves and fruits), although sodium is present in small\nquantities. In particular, the greater part of the chimpanzees\u2019 daily\ndiet (up to 95%) consists of leaves and fruits [6] which contain only\nsmall quantities of sodium. There is however one important\ndietary difference between chimpanzees and mountain gorillas.\nThe Budongo chimpanzees eat meat sporadically, mainly in the\nform of colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza) which are hunted, and\nthis provides an additional source of sodium. The interaction\nbetween Raphia eating and meat eating was not explored in this\nstudy.\nAs in the present study, Rothman et al found significantly lower\nvalues for calcium and phosphorus in decaying wood than in the\nrest of the diet [4]. They also found lower values for manganese\nwhich was not the case in the present study, in which manganese\nwas higher in the Raphia samples (p = 0.059). The reason for this\nmay be the high levels of manganese in groundwater along the\nAlbertine Rift [7]. Mahaney et al found high levels of manganese\nin clay eaten by chimpanzees living in the Mahale mountains,\nTanzania, also along the Rift Valley [8]. Significantly lower values\nfor other minerals, magnesium, potassium, zinc, and copper found\nby Rothman et al were not found in the present study [4].\nBlack and white colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza) are also\nknown to consume Raphia pith in Budongo Forest (pers. comm.,\nfield assistants at BCFS) and during the present study hairs of this\nspecies were twice found at Raphia feeding sites. Oates found high\nlevels of sodium, iron, manganese and zinc in swamp plants eaten\nby black and white colobus monkeys living in Kibale Forest,\nwestern Uganda, also along the Albertine Rift [9]. High mineral\ncontent was also found in some clays collected from stream-banks\nin the forest. Concentrations for swamp plants and clays were\nhigher than in dry-land leaves, buds and fruits constituting the\nmajor part of the monkeys\u2019 diet.\nAn interesting feature of the samples collected concerns samples\n7 and 8. These were the only two non-independent samples\ncollected, coming from the same tree during the same observation\nperiod. Sample 7 consisted of Raphia pith collected with a knife\nfrom inside the tree. Sample 8 consisted of a discarded wadge of\nRaphia pith from the same tree, collected on the ground at the\nfeeding site. Comparison of the sodium content of these two\nsamples shows that the uneaten Raphia pith (sample 7) contained\n7194 mg kg21, whereas the chewed and spat-out wadge (sample 8)\ncontained 1095 mg kg21, evidence that the individual which\nchewed this sample did indeed ingest sodium.\nIn recent years Raphia farinifera, a tree we now know to provide\nthe chimpanzees of Budongo Forest with essential sodium, has\nbecome scarcer. Besides natural predators such as baboons and\npigs that eat its shoots, it provides humans with two products. The\nliving trees are occasionally felled and the trunk opened to allow\nair into the pithy centre, which then ferments and produces an\nalcoholic palm wine beverage which is bottled and sold. This,\nhowever, is not thought to be the main cause of the decline in\nFigure 1. Decaying Raphia farinifera tree with medium sized hole.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0006194.g001\nSodium in Chimpanzee Diet\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e6194\nnumbers of Raphia. The main danger to this species comes from\nlocal tobacco farmers, who kill the tree during its growth period,\nbefore flowering and fruiting, in order to strip its leaves for Raphia\nstring (\u2018raffia\u2019), which is then used to tie tobacco leaves during and\nafter the the drying and curing process [10]. As a result, Raphia\npalms are becoming scarce in Budongo Forest. Tobacco farmers\nand British American Tobacco, a company which buys much of\nthe crop, will be approached about this problem and it is hoped a\nsolution may be found.\nMaterials and Methods\n(a) Field collection\nBetween 16 Feb and 2 April 2008, samples of pith (including\none wadge) from Raphia trees were collected, in each case when\nchimpanzees had been observed feeding on the trees just before\ncollection. Samples weighed ,50 g. Pith samples were obtained\nfrom the inside of trees with use of a knife. The wadge was\ncollected from where it was dropped, beside the hole in the tree.\nTable 1.

Collectors were in all cases trained field assistants of\nBCFS or in one case VR. During the same time period, samples of\nrotten wood, bark, leaves and fruits seen being eaten by\nchimpanzees were collected in the same way, in adjacent forest,\nto be analysed for comparison with the Raphia samples.\nAll samples were taken within a period of 2 hours to the field\nbase where they were removed from the bags with tweezers and\ndried separately in a warm dry space at room temperature.\nSamples were dry in 1\u20133 days and all dried satisfactorily. The dry\nsamples were placed in polythene bags which were sealed, marked,\nand taken by air to the UK for analysis. In the UK prior to\nanalysis they were kept in a dry room at room temperature. No\nsamples were spoiled during the pre-analysis period.\n(b) Laboratory analysis\nThe samples of material were dried to constant weight in an\noven at 105uC. The samples were then ashed at 550uC in a\npyrolysis oven. The total mass of the ashed material was\ndetermined before digesting a sample (circa 0.1 g) of each material\nin 3 mL of aqua regia in a water bath at 100uC for 2 hours. The\ndigested samples were diluted to 10 mL using distilled water\nbefore serially diluting to obtain 1 in 10, 1 in 100 and 1 in 500\ndilutions. The elemental content of each sample was then\ndetermined using a Perkin Elmer Optima 2100 DV Inductively\nCoupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) using\n5 and 10 mg L21 elemental standards.\nFigure 2.
