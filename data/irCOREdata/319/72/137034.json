Nanoparticles have been widely \nused for manufacturing many consumer products such as electronics, computers, food \ncolorants or clothes, arriving on the market at a rate of 3-4 per day [1]. In medical \nfields such as oncology, cardiovascular medicine, molecular diagnostics, drug \ndiscovery and drug delivery nanoparticles are also increasingly used [2-4]. One of the \nfuture intended usages of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is for artificial orthopedic implants \n[5]. Most recently, titanium dioxide nanoparticles chemically linked to antibodies via \nbivalent dihydroxybenzene, so-called phototoxic \"nanobio hybrids\", were used to \nselectively kill glioblastoma multiform brain cancer cells [6]. By conventional \ndefinition one dimension of nanoparticles has to be < 100 nm, however, due to their \nbiological uniqueness not being constrained by this definition the pharmaceutical \nindustry uses sizes of 1-1000 nm to describe nanomaterials [7, 8]. Nanoparticle \nproperties are rather different from bulk materials and these differences include their \nsmall size in the nanometer range, a large surface area to volume ratio [9] and unique \nphysico-chemical properties. Consequently, nanoparticles can easily pass through cell \nmembranes and may show unpredictable toxic effects. The major toxicological \nconcern arising from this is that many nanoparticles which cross cell membranes \nbecome lodged in mitochondria [10] with some of the engineered nanomaterials also \nbeing redox active [11]. Hence, the increasing applications of nanoparticles in various \nfields may lead to an increase in human exposure which in turn may increase direct \ntoxicological effects. Despite apparent advantages of certain nanoparticles and their \napplications, many undesirable side effects of nano-sized particles have been \ndocumented in previous studies over the last decade [12, 13]. \n 5 \nNanoparticles such as zinc oxide (ZnO) and TiO2 are increasingly used in a variety of \nindustrial and medical applications including high-tech materials, plastics, paints and \nproduction of paper, and also very frequently in cosmetics and sun screens [14]. Zinc \noxide and TiO2 nanoparticles with sizes between 50\u2013500 nm are employed to increase \nthe sun protection factor (SPF) of e.g. sunscreens due to their scattering properties, \nwhich enables them to act as nano-mirrors reflecting UV light and as UV filters \nagainst sun radiation. In addition to UV reflection properties, their small size is also \nused as an advantage to improve homogeneity of distribution in cosmetics. However, \nTiO2, in spite of its reflection and scattering properties to UVB and UVA, also \nabsorbs about 70% of the total irradiated UV light [15]. \nThe cytotoxic effects of TiO2 nanoparticles on human A549 lung epithelial cells were \naccompanied by the active up-take of TiO2 nanoparticles by endocytosis [16]. In \nanimals, in vivo studies have also shown that exposure and inhalation of TiO2 \nparticles can induce cytotoxicity in lung cells with subsequent inflammatory \nresponses in lung tissue being directly related to the particle size [17-21]. Garabrant \nand colleagues noted that 17% of the workers exposed to TiO2 were affected by \npleural diseases, which were proportionate to the duration of work in TiO2 \nmanufacturing [22]. In vitro studies on human sperm and lymphocytes also showed \nthat both nano-sized ZnO and TiO2 (10-100 \u00b5g\/ml) were genotoxic to both cell types \nwithin the Comet assay in the absence of toxicity [23], the same was true for bacteria \nand vertebrates [24, 25]. In addition, in vitro studies of ZnO in Chinese hamster ovary \n(CHO) cells and in human epidermal cell lines have revealed clastogenic properties \n[26, 27]. Studies on lymphocytes treated with TiO2 or ZnO nanoparticles showed \nsignificantly increased DNA breakage and micronucleus formation [23, 28]. Effects \nof TiO2 nanoparticles on non-human mammalian cells were also reported, e.g. \n 6 \nexposure of rat liver cells to TiO2 nanoparticles resulted in cytotoxicity [29]. Titanium \ndioxide also induced apoptosis and micronuclei in Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts \n[30]. Various nanoparticles have shown some cytotoxicity and\/or genotoxicity [14, \n31-34], and different mechanisms of damage induction have been suggested including \nradical oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, as well as alteration of signal \ntransduction [35], but the exact mechanism(s) has (have) yet to be found. \n \nSignal transduction pathways are important mechanisms through which the cell \ncoordinates particular functions. Trans-membrane receptors receive and then deliver \nsignals from the extracellular lumen via different mechanisms into the nucleus [36]. \nTyrosine phosphorylation is the major signaling pathway through which receptor \ntyrosine kinases catalyze the transfer of a phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group \non tyrosine residues of protein substrates in turn mediating cell growth, differentiation, \nhost defense, and metabolic regulations [37]. The importance of tyrosine \nphosphorylation events in the presence of toxic nanoparticles was previously reported \nin a study characterizing the anti-bacterial effects of novel silver nanoparticles, which \nwere able to penetrate the bacteria and subsequently modulate the phosphotyrosine \nprofile [35]. \n \nIn this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of ZnO and TiO2 \nnanoparticles using the human epithelial HEp-2 cell line. We also tried to determine \nthe tyrosine phosphorylation events caused by ZnO and TiO2 occurring \nsimultaneously independently of cytotoxicity and at the same time as genotoxicity. \n 7 \nMaterial and Methods \n \nCell culture of the HEp-2 cell line (HeLa derivative) \nHEp-2 cells deriving from human negroid cervix carcinoma were obtained from the \nEuropean collection of cell cultures (ECACC, catalogue No 86030501). Such cells \nhave been the mainstay of cancer research for determining the cytotoxic effects of \ndifferent chemicals [38-40]. HEp-2 cells were maintained in continuous culture in \npre-warmed Eagle's minimal essential medium in Earle\u2019s balanced salt solution \n(EMEM-EBSS) supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 2 mM \nglutamine, 10% (v\/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U\/ml penicillin and 100 mg\/ml \nstreptomycin (P\/S) from Gibco, Paisley, UK. The medium was changed every 3-4 \ndays and the cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 \u00baC. \nCells were passaged upon confluence at a ratio of 1:3. Stocks of cells were routinely \nfrozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. \n \nChemicals \nZinc oxide nano-powder (ZnO; CAS 1314-13-2), and anatase titanium (IV) oxide \nnano-powder (TiO2, 99.7%, CAS 1317-70-0), low melting-point agarose (LMA), \nnormal melting-point agarose (NMA), thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide [3-(4,5-\ndimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide, CAS 298-93-1] (MTT) \ndye; neutral red (NRU) dye (CAS 553-24-2); ethidium bromide (EtBr) and Triton X-\n100 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK. Phosphate buffered \nsaline (Ca2+, Mg2+-free; PBS), Trypan blue dye solution and 10,000 U\/ml of trypsin\u2013\nEDTA were purchased from Gibco. Acrylamide \/ bis-acrylamide solution (30%), Bio-\nRad protein assay dye reagent concentrate (CAS 500-0006), buffers, membranes and \n 8 \nfilms were purchased from Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK. Phosphotyrosine mouse \nmonoclonal antibody (P-Tyr-100) and anti-mouse IgG-HRP linked antibody were \npurchased from Cell Signalling Technology, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK. \n \nParticle preparation and characterization \nNanoparticles were suspended in 10 ml EMEM-EBBS medium at concentrations of \n10, 20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml. Suspensions were probe-sonicated at 30 W for 5 minutes \non and off, and then allowed to equilibrate for different times: 0, 2, 4, 24, and 48 \nhours. The first two times were chosen to look at more immediate effects, the latter \ntwo time points to evaluated long-term effects. The resulting ZnO and TiO2 \nsuspensions were measured as a function of incubation time. Prior to evaluation of the \ntoxic potential, the mean size (hydrodynamic diameter) of the nanoparticles was \ndetermined using a high performance particle sizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., \nWorcestershire, U.K.). Before analysis suspensions were briefly shaken to resemble \nthe cell culture incubation conditions. Suspensions were placed in disposable cuvettes \nand three consecutive measurements at 25 \u00baC each consisting of three runs were \nundertaken. \n \nMitochondrial activity (MTT) assay \nThe MTT assay to evaluate the mitochondrial activity was done according to the \noriginally described method [41]. HEp-2 cells were plated in 96-well plates and the \ncell concentration (~1.5x104) was chosen as previously successfully used [42, 43]. \nThe cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C and 5 % CO2, then incubated for \ndifferent time periods (2, 4, 24 and 48 hours) with ZnO or TiO2 nanoparticles. The \nMTT dye was added 4 h prior to completion of incubation periods. The medium from \n 9 \neach well was discarded and resulting formazan crystals were solubilized by adding \n200 \u03bcl of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and quantified by measuring absorbance at \n570 nm. \n \nNeutral red uptake (NRU) assay  \nThe NRU assay was done to determine the accumulation of the neutral red dye in the \nlysosomes of viable, uninjured cells [44].The medium was discarded and 100 \u03bcl of \nneutral red dye (50 \u03bcg\/ml) dissolved in serum free medium was added to each well. \nAfter incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h, cells were washed with PBS and the dye taken up \nby cells was then dissolved in 200 \u00b5l of a fixative solution (50% ethanol, 49% ddH2O \nand 1% acetic acid) and added to each well. Absorbance was then taken at 570 nm in \nMRX 11 micro-plate reader (Dynex Technologies, USA), using the software \nRevelation version 4.02. \n \nCell viability \nPrior to the Comet assay, cells were incubated with ZnO or TiO2 nanoparticles for 4 h \nat different concentrations (10, 20, 50, 100 \u03bcg\/ml) and assayed for viability using the \nTrypan blue dye exclusion test. The cut-off point was 75% as suggested by Henderson \nand colleagues [45]. \n \nComet assay \nThe sub-confluent monolayer was exposed to four different concentrations of ZnO \nand TiO2, and 2.72 \u03bcg\/ml (= 8 0 \u03bcM) of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a positive \ncontrol. There was also a negative control using untreated cells. After an incubation of \n4 hours, cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested with trypsin-EDTA and \n 10 \nfollowed by a centrifugation at ~180 g for 9 minutes. The pellet was finally \nresuspended in PBS. The Comet slides were prepared by the method as previously \ndescribed [46]. The cell suspension (100 \u03bcl) was mixed with 100 \u03bcl of 1% LMA, of \nwhich 100 \u03bcl was spread onto microscope slides pre-coated with 1% NMA. The slides \nwere kept overnight at 4 \u00b0C in freshly prepared, chilled lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl, \n100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, with 1% Triton X-100; pH 10). The slides were \nsubjected to freshly prepared cold alkaline electrophoresis buffer (1 mM EDTA \nsodium salt and 300 mM NaOH; pH \u226513) for D NA unwinding, then electrophorized \nfor 30 minutes each at 4 \u00b0C in electrophoresis buffer. The electrophoresis buffer was \nneutralized with Tris buffer (400 mM, pH 7.4) and stained with 20 \u03bcg\/ml ethidium \nbromide. Fifty cells from each concentration were scored \u2018blindly\u2019 at a final \nmagnification of 400x using an image analysis system (Komet 4.0 attached to a \nfluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera). The Olive tail moment \nand % tail DNA were used as parameters to measure the DNA damage in each cell. \nThree repeat experiments were carried out over the dose ranges used. \n \nIn vitro cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay \nThe CBMN assay was performed as described previously [47]. HEp-2 cells were \ngrown in 6-well cell culture plates suspended in 2 ml EMEM medium at a \nconcentration of 1x105. After 24 hours of culture, either the TiO2 nanoparticles (10, \n20 and 50 \u00b5g\/ml) or ZnO nanoparticles (10, 20, 50 and 100 \u00b5g\/ml) or mitomycin C \n(positive control; 0.4 \u00b5M = 0.134 \u00b5g\/ml) were added to the cultures. An untreated \nculture served as the negative control. Following 2 hours of incubation, the culture \nmedium was removed and the cells were washed with PBS. After the treatment, 7.5 \u00b5l \ncytochalasin B (final concentration 0.01 mg\/ml) were added to fresh culture medium \n 11 \nand incubated overnight. HEp-2 cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at ~180 g for 8 \nminutes. The cell pellet was treated with a cold hypotonic solution (70 mM KC1) for \n15 minutes and centrifuged at ~180 g rpm for 8 minutes; then fixed in methanol \/ \nacetic acid (3:1), and air-dried. Slides were stained with 5% Giemsa for 10 min for the \ndetection of micronuclei in binucleated cells. Micronuclei were scored and \nfrequencies were evaluated per 1000 binucleated cells. \n \nDetection of tyrosine phosphorylation in HEp-2 cells \nA sub-confluent HEp-2 monolayer was treated with different concentrations (0, 10, 20, \n50 and 100 \u00b5g\/ml) of ZnO or TiO2 nanoparticles and incubated for 4 hours. Untreated \ncells served as a negative control. After the treatment, the cells were trypsinized and \nsuspended in 10 ml PBS and centrifuged at ~180 g for 9 minutes. The HEp-2 cell \npellet was resuspended in 200 \u00b5l PBS and assessed (10 \u00b5l) for viability and \nmembrane integrity using the Trypan blue dye exclusion test. Ninety microliters of \ncell suspension were added to 10 ml PBS for Western Blotting, while the rest (100 \u00b5l) \nwas used for the Comet assay. After centrifugation (~180 g for 9 minutes), lysing \nbuffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors was added to the pellet and the \nresulting cell suspension was briefly sonicated (~5 seconds) at 30 W. Protein \nconcentrations were determined in each sample using the Bio-Rad assay [48]. The cell \nlysate was suspended in Laemli sample buffer and 35 \u00b5g protein from each sample \nwas loaded on SDS gel and detected by the immunoblotting technique using a \nphosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal primary antibody (P-Tyr-100) and an anti-mouse \nIgG-HRP linked secondary antibody. \n \nStatistical analysis \n 12 \nThe means from MTT and NRU data were compared to the means of the negative \ncontrol data using the one-way ANOVA test. A Mann-Whitney U-test was used for \nthe Comet assay. For the CBMN assay, the Chi square test and Fishers exact test were \nused to compare the number of MN in the treated samples to the negative control of \nuntreated HEp-2 samples. The threshold of significance was p < 0.05. Values at or \nbelow this were considered significant. \n \n 13 \nResults \n \nParticle characterization \nDynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticle \nsuspensions were obtained with a high performance particle sizer. Using DLS, \nparticle sizes were observed to be widely distributed. The increase in size \n(aggregation) occurred with increasing dose but remained constant over a 48-hour \nperiod except at higher doses of TiO2 (Table 1). Although the particle size \nconsiderably increased as a function of concentration was minimally increased as a \nfunction of time. \n \n(Insert Table 1) \n \nCytotoxicity \nThe MTT assay and the NRU assay \nThe results demonstrated a concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity as \nmeasured by optical density (OD) at 570 nm after exposure to ZnO or TiO2 \nnanoparticles which was evident for ZnO but not for TiO2 due to precipitation after \n24 h (Figure 1). The percentage (%) cell survival in the MTT assay compared to the \nuntreated control was decreased dramatically in 24 and 48 hours in ZnO treated cells \nreaching ~16% at the highest ZnO concentration (100 \u00b5g\/ml). However, the highest \nconcentrations of TiO2 (50 and 100 \u03bcg\/ml) were precipitated within 24 hours as the \nresults for the OD showed higher readings compared to the negative control (> 140%). \n 14 \nThe NRU assay showed similar results as the MTT assay and demonstrated a \nconcentration and time dependent cytotoxicity after exposure to ZnO or TiO2 \nnanoparticles for more than 4 hours (Figure 1). \n \n(Insert Figure 1) \n \nGenotoxicity \nCell viability and membrane integrity \nThe cell viability in the Comet assay and immunoblotting assay using the Trypan blue \ndye exclusion assay was between 70-85% for all ZnO and TiO2 samples, with the \nexception of the highest dose of TiO2 (100 \u00b5g\/ml), which showed 65% viability. All \ndoses examined, therefore had high membrane integrity. \n \nDNA damage \nThe parameters of Olive tail moment (OTM) and % tail DNA indicated significant \n(p < 0.05) dose-related DNA damage in HEp-2 cells. Exposure for 4 h to different \nconcentrations of ZnO or TiO2 nanoparticles showed a 3-fold increase for ZnO and a \n2-fold increase for TiO2 in DNA damage compared to the negative control of \nuntreated HEp-2 cells. However, for the lowest ZnO dose the induced damage, \nmeasured in % tail DNA, did not reach significance levels, but did for the OTM (see \nTable 2 and Figure 2). \n \n(Insert Figure 2 and Table 2) \n \nIn vitro CBMN assay \n 15 \nWe observed the formation of MN after treatment with different ZnO (0, 10, 20, 50, \nand 100 \u00b5g\/ml) and TiO2 concentrations (0, 10, 20, and 50 \u00b5g\/ml) for 2 hr (Table 3). \nThe Chi-squared analysis of the MN frequencies from HEp-2 cells exposed to \ndifferent ZnO and TiO2 concentrations revealed a significant increase in induced MN \ntreated with high concentrations of ZnO (50 and 100 \u03bcg\/ml) or TiO2 (50 \u03bcg\/ml) \ncompared to the untreated cell control (p < 0.05). However, lower concentrations (<50 \n\u03bcg\/ml) of either ZnO or TiO2 did not induce significant alterations in MN induction. \nThe MN frequency increased with ZnO concentration in a specific dose-dependent \nmanner (p < 0.05, Chi-squared test) from an average frequency of 11 MN per 1000 \nbinucleated cells in the control to 28 MN per 1,000 binucleated cells at 100 \u00b5g\/ml. \nFor TiO2, the MN frequencies increased in a similar way reaching 31 MN per 1000 \nbinucleated cells at a dose of 50 \u00b5g\/ml. \n \n(Insert Table 3) \n \nTyrosine phosphorylation \nHEp-2 cells were challenged with different concentrations of ZnO (0, 10, 20, 50, and \n100 \u03bcg\/ml) and TiO2 (0, 10, 20, and 50 \u03bcg\/ml) for 4 h, and phosphotyrosine \nexpression was analyzed by Western blotting analysis. The level of tyrosine \nphosphorylation was up-regulated by ZnO nanoparticles, which induced an increase \nin phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on 20, 21-22, 25, 30, and ~80 kDa proteins \n(Figures 3). Less effect was seen with TiO2 inducing a fainter effect at 20, 21-22, 25, \nand 30 kDa at the highest dose; however, no effect was observed at ~80 kDa. \n \n(Insert Figure 3) \n 16 \nDiscussion \n \nMany toxicological studies over the past years have raised concerns regarding the \nsafety of nanoparticles as they readily generate oxidative stress through reactive \noxygen species (ROS). A strong link between nanoparticles and oxidative stress via \nROS has been documented [49, 50]. Many investigators have shown that ROS play a \nmajor role in nanoparticle-induced DNA damage [51]. However, detailed molecular \nmechanisms involved in the cellular responses to genotoxic effects are not yet fully \nunderstood. Oxygen radicals can cause single and double strand breaks. Damaging the \nDNA sugar-phosphate backbone or the bases may then lead to acute DNA damage, \nwhich triggers cell cycle arrest and leads to prolonged repair time or cell death [52]. \nAccumulation of mutations which are caused by excessive or incomplete DNA repair \nis a known cause of oncogenesis [53]. Morz and colleagues found that nanoparticles \nproduced an effect similar to irradiation by inducing carcinogenesis pathways through \nROS-induced DNA damage, as well as activating p53 and proteins related to DNA \nrepair [54]. The DNA damage may be either primary as a direct effect of the \nnanoparticles or a secondary effect due to generated ROS [55]. Accordingly, ROS \nmay be one of the possible modes suggested for ZnO and TiO2 induced DNA damage. \nOxidative stress is now considered a major cellular signaling regulator and it was \nsuggested that genotoxicity mediated by ROS could be further linked to other \npathways [55]; therefore, we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway \nadditionally to the induction of DNA damage. \n \nIn view of the importance of tyrosine kinase activity in the control of cell function and \nthe importance of redox mechanisms in regulating the phosphorylation by tyrosine \n 17 \nkinases, it was of interest to determine whether the functional changes induced by \naltering the redox status of HEp-2 cells were associated with changes in the pattern of \ntyrosine phosphorylation. The immunoblotting analyses of HEp-2 cells cultured and \ntreated with ZnO for 4 hours, then using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, \nrevealed heavily phosphorylated tyrosine residues on a protein with a molecular mass \nof 20 kDa (Figure 3). Also bands at 25 and 30 kDa showed phosphorylation of \ntyrosine residues. A diffuse band of immuno-reactive material could also frequently \nbe observed migrating in advance of this protein with a molecular mass of 21-22 kDa.  \nThis could be highly significant as a correlation was previously found between cell \ntransformation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of 22-kDa protein [56]. In addition, \nprevious studies showed, that dysregulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is \ncrucial for cell signaling maintenance with subsequent cell proliferation and the early \nstages of neoplasia [57, 58]. Stimulation of HEp-2 cells with ZnO was also associated \nwith a dramatic enhancement in the intensity of phosphotyrosyl proteins. The increase \nin a 20 kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by ZnO was observed over the \nwhole range of concentrations (10-100 \u00b5g\/ml). Zinc oxide nanoparticles at a dose of \n100 \u00b5g\/ml additionally had a stimulatory effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of an ~80 \nkDa protein (Figure 3). The same dose gave a significant 3-fold increase in the Olive \ntail moment and % tail DNA in the Comet assay when compared to the untreated \ncontrol (Table 2). On the other hand, TiO2 produced fainter bands at 20 kDa and only \nfor the 50 \u00b5g\/ml treatment dose phosphorylation at 21-22, 25, and 30 kDa (Figure 3). \nNo effect was seen at ~80 kDa for TiO2. As a result, tyrosine phosphorylation may \nhave contributed to the genotoxicity of ZnO but less to TiO2 genotoxicity. \n \n 18 \nWe examined the consequences of genotoxic injury to HEp-2 cells by ZnO and TiO2 \nto elaborate the signaling events that modulate cell survival after genotoxic exposure. \nPrevious studies on HeLa cells showed activation of Cdk1 as a result of etoposide \ntreatment lead to cell cycle checkpoint override with subsequent cell death [59]. In in-\nvitro studies on human U937 monocytes nano-cobalt increased the transcription of \nmatrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) \nsignaling pathways were involved through oxidative stress [60]. Previous studies also \nfound that sodium vanadate induced protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibition. \nThis resulted in a bypass of growth arrest that occurred as the result of genotoxic \nexposure which indicates a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of cell \nsurvival [61]. PTP inhibition was also previously reported in primary mammary \nepithelial cells which enhanced cell survival by decreasing apoptosis [62]. \n \nIn our study, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of ZnO and TiO2 were tested in HEp-2 \ncells. Cytotoxicity was measured using the MTT and NRU assays; genotoxicity was \nassessed by the Comet and CBMN assays to measure the DNA damaging and \ngenotoxic potential. Our data showed a cytotoxic effect of ZnO in mitochondrial \nactivity (MTT assay) and the ability of lysosomes to retain neutral red stain (NRU \nassay) in HEp-2 cells after treatment for 24 and 48 hours with different ZnO \nconcentrations with the exception of the lowest dose (10 \u00b5g\/ml) which showed no \ncytotoxicity even after 48 hours treatment (Figure 1, Table 1 and 2). The treatment \ntimes used for cell cultures extended well beyond the 4 h treatment times used for the \nComet assay. On the other hand, 100 \u00b5g\/ml of TiO2 proved to be significantly toxic \nafter 2 hours on HEp-2 cells (Figure 1). For both doses, 50 and 100 \u00b5g\/ml, TiO2 \nprecipitated in the wells after 24 hours. Hence, treated cells showed an OD which \n 19 \nwas > 140% when compared to the untreated control in the MTT and NRU assays. \nThe TiO2 concentration of 20 \u00b5g\/ml was cytotoxic to the cells in both assays to \ndifferent extents in 24 h treatment assays.  \n \nAggregation of nanoparticles observed in our study has been reported previously for \nTiO2 [63] as well as for ZnO [64] and is considered as an inherent property of \nuncoated oxide nanoparticles which occur in aqueous conditions from distilled water \nto complex biological media. Although, previous studies have shown that the particle \nsolubility of a range of metal oxide nanoparticles like ZnO with release of free \nhydrated zinc ions (Zn2+) strongly influenced cytotoxicity compared to extremely less \nsoluble metal oxides like TiO2 [65-67]. In our study, as the particle size increased \nwith the concentration, the aggregation did not change over a time period of up to 48 \nhours for ZnO and 24 hours for TiO2. Despite increasing in size our particles stayed \nwell below the pharmaceutical size definition for nanoparticles [7, 8]. For the \nphosphorylation studies, exposure was only 4 hours for both nanoparticle compounds. \nTherefore, we assumed that the rate and quantities of dissolution was either negligible \nor of little significance for our experiments.  \n \nOur results demonstrated the DNA damaging potential of different concentrations of \nZnO or TiO2 with significant increases in the tail moment and % tail DNA in the \nComet assays (3-fold for ZnO) at the highest dose and (2-fold for TiO2) at the highest \ndose compared to untreated control (Figure 2). The DNA damaging and mutagenic \npotential of ZnO or TiO2 at various concentrations was also seen for the CBMN \nassays. Our result regarding the genotoxic potential of ZnO or TiO2 is supported by a \nprevious studies conducted by Gopalan and colleagues [23], which showed a \n 20 \nconcentration-related increase in Olive tail moment in lymphocytes and sperm. Also, \nan increase in chromosome aberrations in CHO cells treated with ZnO has been \npreviously reported [26]. PTP inhibition [61] or increased transcription of matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and PTK signaling pathways [60] could \nexplain our findings of increased tyrosine phosphorylation as the result of genotoxic \ninsult of ZnO and the highest concentration of TiO2. \n \n 21 \nConclusions \n \nThe present investigation conclusively provides further evidence for the genotoxic \neffect of ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles in both the Comet assay and the micronucleus \nassay with induction of chromosomal damage at high, but non-cytotoxic (according to \nTrypan blue exclusion) concentrations of ZnO (50 and 100 \u00b5g\/ml) and TiO2 (50 \n\u00b5g\/ml). It also provides evidence of significantly increased chromosomal mutations at \nthe highest concentrations which showed no cytotoxic effects in the NRU and MTT \nassays. Furthermore, ZnO increased tyrosine phosphorylation of five proteins at 20, \n21-22, 25, 30, and ~80 kDa with less effect of TiO2 which showed increased \nphosphorylation compared to the negative control at 20, 21-22, 25, and 30 kDa for the \nhighest dose but not at ~80 kDa. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is modified by both \nZnO and TiO2 while causing genotoxic damage seen for two different end points in \nthe Comet and CBMN assays in the absence of cytotoxicity. \n \n 22 \nFuture perspectives \n \nNanotechnology holds great promises for medicine, manufacturing and for the \nenvironment including efficient water purification and removal of toxic waste. \nCurrently, nanoparticles like ZnO and TiO2 are already widely used in many \nconsumer products. The variety of applications ranges from using nanoparticles \nwithin sunscreens, pigments, tooth pastes, antiseptic coatings, paints and the coating \nof spectacles to make them unbreakable and scratchproof. As a result, the evaluation \nof the toxic potential of nanoparticles within their substrate is imperative. However, in \nmany cases detailed toxicological evaluation of nanoparticles including their \ngenotoxic assessment is lagging behind the technological application of medical and \nconsumer nano-products. Thus, in the very near future the focus will shift from \nnanotechnology towards nanotoxicology. Recent studies and our study have shown \nthat under certain conditions nanoparticles can increase genotoxic damage within cells \nand potentially lead to adverse effects. \n 23 \nExecutive summary \n \n\u2022 Cytotoxicity of ZnO  \nThe mitochondria and lysosome activity tests (MTT assay and NRU) indicated \ncytotoxicity of ZnO to HEp-2 cells treated beyond 4 h reaching cell survival of < 16% \nafter 48 hours.  \n\u2022 Cytotoxicity of TiO2 \nThe highest TiO2 concentration (100 \u00b5g\/ml) was cytotoxic to HEp-2 cells in less than \n2 hours. \n\u2022 Genotoxicity of ZnO  \nGenotoxicity of ZnO in HEp-2 cells was seen within the Comet assay showing a 3-\nfold increase in DNA damage. For the CBMN assay, an increase in the formation of \nmicronuclei was found after treatment with different concentrations ZnO. \n\u2022 Genotoxicity of TiO2  \nThe genotoxic potential of TiO2 in HEp-2 cells was confirmed in both cytogenetic \nassays, for the Comet assay showing a 2-fold increase in DNA damage after treatment \nand for the CBMN assay revealing a dose-dependent increase in MN formation. \n\u2022 Tyrosine phosphorylation of HEp-2 cells treated with ZnO \nThe level of tyrosine phosphorylation was up-regulated after exposure to ZnO \nnanoparticles, significantly increasing phosphorylation events of tyrosine residues on \n20 kDa, 21-22 kDa, 25 kDa, 30 kDa, and 80 kDa proteins. \n\u2022 Tyrosine phosphorylation of HEp-2 cells treated with TiO2 \nTiO2 showed less effect on tyrosine phosphorylation at the higher doses. There was \nsome effect on 21-22, 25, and 30 kDa proteins but not at ~80 kDa.  \n \n 24 \n References \n1.

ACS Nano 2(10), 2121-2134 (2008). \n \n \n 28 \nFigure legends  \n \nFigure 1: \nCytotoxicity of ZnO (upper two graphs) and TiO2 (lower two graphs) nanoparticles on \nhuman HEp-2 cells treated for different times for ZnO (2, 4, 24, and 48 hours) and  \nfor TiO2 (2, 4, and 24 hours), was measured using the MTT and the NRU assays. \nThe % cell survival compared to the negative control of untreated HEp-2 cells was \nevaluated for different concentrations of ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles. The values \nrepresent the mean of three separate experiments. \n \nFigure 2: \nThe effect of TiO2 or ZnO nanoparticle exposure is shown on DNA damage in HEp-2 \ncells as measured by the Comet assay. Cells were exposed to TiO2 or ZnO at \nconcentrations of 0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg\/ml for 4 hours. The positive control was \ntreated with 2.72 \u03bcg\/ml H2O2 also for 4 hours (significance values are shown in Table \n2). The values represent the mean of three separate experiments. \n \nFigure 3: \nEffects of ZnO and TiO2 on HEp-2 receptor signaling are shown. An increase in \nphosphorylation of tyrosine residues can be seen in a Western blot of equal amounts \nof total proteins (Bio-Rad method) from HEp-2 cells treated for 4 h with different \nconcentrations 10, 20, and 50 \u00b5g\/ml as well as 100 \u00b5g\/ml (only for ZnO). Untreated \nHEp-2 cells served as a negative control (Con). Panel A illustrates for ZnO that all \nbands at all doses are phosphorylated at 20 and 21-22 kDa, but also at 25 and 30 kDa \nand to some extent at ~80 kDa. For TiO2, there is less of an effect at the three doses \n 29 \nexamined at 20 and 21-22 kDa. Also at 25 kDa was some small increase above \ncontrol values at 20 and 50 \u00b5g\/ml and at 30 kDa at 50 \u00b5g\/ml. There was no increase \nin phosphorylation found for TiO2 at ~80 kDa. The values represent the mean of three \nseparate experiments. Panel B shows as an example the effect of GAPDH as an \ninternal control seen alongside ZnO at 50 and 100 \u00b5g\/ml to confirm equal protein \nloading. \n \n"}
