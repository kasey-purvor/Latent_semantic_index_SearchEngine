At many of the meetings I attend, I hear about the urgency of\nfocusing our CAL effort, but the conviction around the table is often tempered by\nlecturers' complaints that the off-the-shelf courseware they have tried either does not\nwork well, or does not fit their particular needs, or both. So a suggestion is made: we\nshould move in the direction of developing our own high-quality educational software\ntailored to our individual requirements. And since these requirements are very diverse\nover the whole campus, we should establish a Centre for Educational Technology, a\nCourseware Resources and Advice Unit, a Virtual Learning Development Laboratory, an\nInstitute for Computer-Based Academic Practice . . . call it what you will. It should be\nstaffed by experts who can advise departments and produce for them, or help them to\nproduce, the exact software they require. It should be supported by a battalion of\ntechnicians, and should not only be equipped with white-hot multimedia but also backed\nby sufficient financial resources to ensure continuous upgrades so as to remain in a\npermanent state of state-of-the-art. The bank balance is not as healthy as it might be\n(whose is?), but the university management must nevertheless somehow be convinced of\nthe necessity of spending money on the project.\nI wonder how many ALT members recognize the scenario. I know some who certainly will\nbe familiar with at least parts of it. Most HE institutions utter noises about the need to\nmake as much use as possible of computer technology in teaching, but in a significant\nnumber of them the decision-makers are still unwilling to commit money while they are\nbeing given contradictory messages. They are informed on the one hand that the future\nsuccess of the institution may depend on a large-scale implementation of learning\n2\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 3\ntechnology, and on the other that comparatively little educational software is being used\nwithin curricula because what is available is so often defective or otherwise unsuitable. In\ntheir minds, the two arguments do not converge on an expensive, wide-ranging\nprogramme of courseware development.\nPart of the thinking behind the TLTP initiative was that it would address this problem:\nthat is, that it would bring together expertise, thus avoiding duplication of effort, and that\nthe targeted software produced would be made available to appropriate departments in\ninstitutions nation-wide. But TLTP has had less success than was hoped for in seeing the\nresulting products actually used, let alone relied upon as indispensable teaching resources.\nI do not believe that this situation is primarily due to a xenophobic not-invented-here\nsyndrome, but rather to the fact that most TLTP products genuinely fail to measure up\nprecisely to course requirements and standards, for whatever reasons.\nI have dealt with essentially the same issue from a different angle in an editorial in this\njournal more than three years ago, and am no further on than I was then in being able to\npropose a practicable solution to what is, for ALT, a major strategic problem. By the time\nthis editorial appears, we shall have had ALT-C 96, where we shall doubtless have heard\npaper after paper enthusing directly or indirectly about the benefits of learning\ntechnology. But the authors of those papers will be preaching to the converted and the\nready-to-be-converted. What should we do to convince Doubting Thomas?\nGabriel Jacobs\n3\n"}
