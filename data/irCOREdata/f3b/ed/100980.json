To design transistors for integrated electronics,\nhowever, the ideal structure must also be compatible with\nconventional silicon device processing. The 2D silicon layers\nappear to be the best choice for current fabrication tech-\nniques due to the planar geometry that is utilized in current\ncomplementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. Re-\ncently, by controlling the deposition \u0001chemical vapor deposi-\ntion\u0002 process at a very low deposition rate, ultrathin \u0001\u00025 nm\u0002\nflat nanocrystalline silicon \u0001nc-Si\u0002 layers were achieved and\napplied as the channel for transistors in low power\napplications.4 It is proven that using such an ultrathin chan-\nnel effectively improves the switching performance of thin-\nfilm transistors in nc-Si.5 When the channel becomes thinner,\nthe OFF-state leakage current IOFF decreases significantly,\nwhich is attributed to the stronger quantum confinement ef-\nfect along the channel thickness direction. The subthreshold\nswing \u0001S\u0002 also becomes steeper because the effect of gate\nvoltage on the channel surface potential increases. Low IOFF\nand steep S result in a high ION \/ IOFF ratio.5 The high\nION \/ IOFF ratio will enable the transistors to be used to design\nintegrated electronics on arbitrary substrates for the applica-\ntions, where low power and fast access times are demanded.\nHowever, when the nc-Si layer becomes very thin, even\nthe smallest thickness variation can result in highly random\npotential fluctuations due to the strong quantum confinement\neffect along the channel thickness direction,6 and charge\ntraps at grain boundaries \u0001GBs\u0002 will also deplete the nc-Si\ngrains of free carriers.7 These will make the carrier transport\nfrom the source to the drain through the device channel be-\ncome much more complicated, and result in electrical char-\nacteristics that may not be described by conventional field-\neffect transistor \u0001FET\u0002 models. In the present study, current\npercolation is found in the nc-Si transistors with a channel\nthickness below 3.0 nm, and it is shown that for these de-\nvices, the device channel width must contain at least 0.3 \u0001m\nto avoid percolative \u201cpinch off\u201d by the channel boundaries.\nThe devices to be studied here are composed of a thin\nlayer of undoped nc-Si, varying from 3.0 to 2.0 nm, a gate\ninsulator with an effective oxide thickness of 22.5 nm, and a\n100 nm thick layer of phosphorous-doped poly-Si as the gate\nelectrode, as shown in Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001b\u0002. The channel\nlength is fixed as 0.5 \u0001m. The average grain size of the\nchannel is about 10 nm, as observed from the planar trans-\nmission electron microscopy images.

The uniformity and the\nreproducibility of the ultrathin nc-Si layers are achieved by\ncontrolling the deposition condition carefully. The output\ncharacteristics \u0001IDS-VDS\u0002 for a 2.5 nm thick channel transistor\nof 0.5 \u0001m channel length and 0.4 \u0001m channel width are\nshown in Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002, indicating a typical FET behavior.\nHowever, as shown in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, where the normalized\nIDS-VGS characteristics measured at VDS=0.1 V for different\nchannel width transistors of a 2.5 nm thick channel are dis-\nplayed, the current degrades greatly when the channel width\n\u0001W\u0002 is below 0.3 \u0001m.\nFigure 2\u0001b\u0002 illustrates the extracted threshold voltage Vth\nas functions of the channel width as the channel thickness\nvaries as 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 nm. The Vth was defined as the\nvalue of the Vgs at a drain current value of 1 nA \/\u0001m. We\nfind large Vth shifts and also significant increase in Vth dis-\npersion in devices of 2.0 and 2.5 nm channel thickness, when\nthe channel width is smaller than 0.3 \u0001m. While for the de-\nvices with 3.0 nm thick channel, the measured Vth values\nhave little dependence on the channel width. A clear increase\nin Vth was also observed for single crystalline silicon MOS-\nFETs of channel widths narrower than 10 nm due to the\nquantum confinement in the channel width direction.8 How-\never, here, the channel width is much larger than the scale at\nwhich the quantum confinement may occur. The significantly\nincreased Vth and its dispersion for narrower channel devices\nof 2.0 and 2.5 nm thick channels are attributed to other\nmechanisms.\nIn nc-Si films, the defect levels at GBs behave as traps\nfor free carriers. The charging of the traps at the GBs implies\na removal of free charges from the grains, thereby, creating\npotential-energy barriers.7 Due to the small free concentra-\ntion of carriers \u0001with the intrinsic carrier concentration of Si\u0002\nand also the small grain sizes, the crystalline regions within\nthe intrinsic nc-Si grains will be fully depleted, inducing\nvariations of the conduction band edge \u0001EC0\u0002 from that in\nsingle crystal material.9 In general, the trapping effects of the\nGB are related to its structure which is determined by a mu-\ntual misorientation of the neighboring crystalline grains.7\nWhen the film becomes very thin, the quantum confinement\nalso becomes significant and has a strong dependence on the\nthickness, causing additional changes in EC0, which can be\napproximated as6\n\u0003EC0 =\nh2\n8m\ne\n*tSi\n2 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere m\ne\n* is the quantization effective mass of an electron, h\nis the Planck constant, and tSi is the channel thickness.\nThese factors make EC0 very sensitive to the local physi-\ncal properties of the film \u0001film thickness, crystalline orienta-\ntion, grain size, etc.\u0002, thus inducing large energy potential\nfluctuations over the whole channel. Current conduction in\nsuch an ultrathin nc-Si channel can thus be formalized as a\npercolation problem in a 2D rectangular lattice system.10 The\nlattice is randomly filled with individual sites \u0001grains\u0002 and\nGBs are randomly formed between adjacent sites as bonds.\nAs the gate voltage VGS is increased, localized pockets of\nelectrons will form in the grains with lowest EC0. The frac-\ntion of these conductive grains in the channel is denoted as f ,\nwhich is a function of VGS. As more and more such conduc-\ntive grains are generated during the increase in gate potential,\nf reaches a certain value and there is possibly an infinite\ncluster of conductive grains bridging the source and drain for\ncurrent conduction. The bond \u0001GB\u0002 is assigned as conducting\nwhen both neighboring grains are conducting. Then, for very\nthin channels, actual current path from source to drain under\na low gate bias condition is not the whole film but a naturally\nformed quasi-1D path with only low energy potential parts in\na film. Intuitively, for narrow channel devices, the formation\nof the current path is limited by the boundaries of the chan-\nnel, and a higher VGS for a higher f is required to achieve\ncurrent percolation, as shown in Fig. 3. For a more quantita-\ntive analysis, that average conductivity of a very thin nc-Si\nchannel with grain size d, length L, and width W can be\napproximated as11\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 IDS-VGS characteristics at a drain bias of 0.1 V for\n2.5 nm thick channel devices of different channel widths, showing the chan-\nnel width dependence.

The values of fc and \u0006 are 0.33 and 1.33, respectively,\nin the case of percolation on planar random lattices.12\nBased on Eqs. \u00012\u0002 and \u00013\u0002, the f value to achieve the\nsame normalized conductivity Jc=0.6 is calculated for differ-\nent W, as shown in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002. It can be seen that, to achieve\na certain current conductivity, for narrower channel devices,\na higher f is required. Since f is a function of VGS, it means\nthat a higher VGS is required for the narrow channel to be\nequally conductive. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002, there is\nan increase in Vth for the 2.0 and 2.5 nm thick channel de-\nvices when the channel width is narrower than 0.3 \u0001m. In\nnarrow channel devices, the presence of the channel bound-\nary pinch-off causes various f values being required for dif-\nferent devices to achieve similar conductivity, thus large dis-\npersion of Vth in the narrow channel devices is expected as\nwell as observed.\nIn a thicker channel device, the quantum confinement\nbecomes weaker, and the resultant smaller increase in EC0\nbrings lower Vth, as shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. The film is also less\nrough than the thinner ones. As a result, the potential fluc-\ntuations \u0003V can decrease greatly since \u0003V is given by\n\u0003V =\n\u0003\u0003EC0\n\u0003d\n\u0007 \u0005\n1\nd3\n\u0007 , \u00014\u0002\nwhere the roughness is characterized by the height \u0007 and the\nlateral correlation length of the Gaussian fluctuations.6 With\na smaller \u0003V, there will be a much quicker increase in f with\nthe increase in VGS for current percolation to occur, as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002. So the difference between the VGS values\nof the narrow channel and the wide channel devices to\nachieve the required f for equal channel conductivity become\nless. This is the reason why the Vth of the 2.5 nm thick chan-\nnel devices has a much smaller channel width dependence\nthan that of 2.0 nm thick channel devices, as illustrated in\nFig. 2\u0001b\u0002. For the 3.0 nm thick channel devices, \u0003V is small\nenough, and the VGS to achieve the required f for different\nchannel width transistors are almost identical, and thus Vth\nhas little dependence on W.\nAs a conclusion, for the nc-Si transistors, when the chan-\nnel is thinner than 3.0 nm, current percolation occurs due to\nlarge potential variations over the channel film. It is observed\nthat with the channel length of 0.5 \u0001m, the device channel\nwidth must contain at least 0.3 \u0001m to avoid percolative\npinch off. The theoretical analysis agrees with the experi-\nmental results very well, and gives indications for modelling\nand optimization of the devices for circuit design. According\nto the analysis, it can be expected as the channel length de-\ncreases, the minimum channel width to avoid percolative\npinch off will become smaller. Both channel length and\nwidth dependence of the threshold voltage dispersion will\nneed to be investigated to fully model the device operation.\nStatistical modeling of the device characteristics, as a func-\ntion of the device geometries, film thickness, average grain\nsize, and size distribution, is another important issue to be\nsolved for practical applications of the devices in large scale\nsystem design.\nThis work was funded by EPSRC, GBEPSRC Portfolio\nPartnership Award in Integrated Electronics.
