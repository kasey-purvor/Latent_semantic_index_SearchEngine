Introduction \n \nMeasurement of high frequency Acoustic Emissions (AE) has become a viable technique \nin the condition monitoring of many types of rotating machinery [1-5]. On real \noperational machinery it is often only practical to take AE measurements from non-\nrotating members, at or on the bearing housing. Consequently, AE signals originating \nfrom any component other than the bearing will incur significant attenuation to an AE \nreceiving sensor attached on the bearing housing. Furthermore, the AE signal will be \nfurther colored by the characteristic frequency response of the AE transducer itself. In \nlight of these factors, interpretation of the AE signals is not trivial. Frequencies \nassociated with AE activity cover a broad frequency range of between 20KHz to 1MHz.  \n \nPublications of vibration analysis to gear fault diagnosis are widely available and the \nsubject has been investigated for over four decades. Most gear failures are a result of \nbending and surface fatigue. Drosjact et. al [6] attempted to relate changes in gear defect \nvibration frequencies with the actual physical mechanism that caused such a change.  It \nwas postulated that changes in tooth thickness due to the presence of pits cause \nmodifications in the Hertzian compliance. In addition, it was commented that pitting \ncaused instantaneous changes in Hertzian stiffness which generated a Hertzian impact as \na direct result of the sudden velocity differences between the pinion and the wheel. \nFurthermore, micro pitting was identified as a source of increased vibrations. Micro \npitting is linked with the initiation of other failure modes such as pitting, scuffing, and \nflank initiated bending failures. Traditional gear design has addressed pitting resistance as \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nthe limiting process for gear life but more recently micro pitting has received \nconsiderable attention especially in conditions of low film thickness where it is the \ndominant life limitations[7].  Pitting is a phenomena associated with rolling contacts.  \n \nAl-Balushi et al [8]employed energy-based methods for diagnosis of spurs gears in a \nback-to-back gearbox.  The test rig was run to failure for 40hrs. Analysis of relative \nenergy was used for diagnosis and compared with statistical methods (Kurtosis etc). \nMore specifically the square root of energy index, cumulative energy index and \ncumulative square root of energy index were computed. Test results related AE energy \nlevels to a broken teeth and signs of pitting. It is interesting to note that no torque\/load \nvales were presented, furthermore, it would be expected that should stress levels be large \nenough to cause tooth failure within 40-hours, pitting across the entire gear teeth would \nbe evident. The results were also compared with vibration data for a helicopter gearbox. \nAl-Balushi author suggested that AE technique was advantageous in relation to the \nvibration method for identification and location of a defect.  There was no specific \ninformation on the characteristics of the AE sensors employed, however, AE signatures \nwere band pass filtered between range 40 KHz to 60 KHz. \n \nTandon et al. [9] applied AE to spur gears in a back-to-back gearbox test-rig. The speed \nof the motor was kept constant at 1000rpm while the load varied during the test. A jet oil \nlubrication system was employed for lubrication. The AE sensor employed had a \nresonant frequency of 375 KHz. Simulated pits of constant depth (500\u00b5m) and variable \ndiameter (250\/350\/450\/550\/1100 and 2200\u00b5m) were introduced by spark erosion on the \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \npitch line. Three AE parameters were measured; energy, peak amplitude and AE counts. \nTandon concluded that the AE parameters increased as the defect size (diameter of pit) \nand the load increased. The AE measurements indicated a sharp increase when the defect \nsize was around 500\u00b5m whereas vibration data showed a comparable increase in activity \nwhen the defect size was more than 1000\u00b5m, indicating an advantage of AE over \nvibration for early detection of defects in gears. \n \nSentoku [10] undertook investigations into the application of AE to spur gear defect \ndiagnosis under forced lubrication conditions at rotational speeds of 800 rpm and \n992rpm. An AE sensor was placed on a gear wheel and the detected AE signature was \ntransmitted across a mercury slip ring. The resonant frequency of the AE sensor was 350 \nKHz. In addition, a strain gauge was placed on the root of the tooth in order to related AE \nactivity to changes in the tooth root strain values. During tests the surface roughness of \nthe tooth was measured at appropriate times, as was the pitting size. No faults were \nseeded, and natural pitting occurred during the course of the test. During early stages of \nthe test (number of cycles 5x104 to 106), Sentoku observed no changes in AE amplitude, \nrather it was noted that the AE signal became smoother.  At that point, visual inspection \nconfirmed that there was no pitting on the gear tooth surface. As the number of cycles \nincreased (11x105 to 18x105) AE amplitude increased, as did the pitting area ratio. It was \nconcluded that AE amplitude and energy increased with an increase in pitting.  \n \nMiyachika et al [11] performed a bending fatigue test using three different gears with \ncommon module (4mm), pressure angle (20\u00b0) and number of teeth (18). Two sets of \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \ngears were made of SC415 steel, had a face width of 10mmand were case hardened to a \ndepth 0.9mm and 1.8mm (Hardness, Hv 550). A third gear set was normailsed with a   \nface width 8mm. An AE sensor was placed on the gear and AE signatures were filtered \nbetween 200 KHz to 1000 KHz. For the two case-hardened gears, an increase in event \ncounts and cumulative event counts was observed just before initiation of a tooth crack. \nFor the normalized gear not such an observation was made. Furthermore, on case \nhardened gears an increase in cumulative event count increased with crack growth to a \nspecific depth of hardness, after which the rate was almost constant. The peak amplitude \nof the case-hardened gears was also higher than the one from the normalized ones. \n \nSingh et al [12] undertook experiments on two different types of gearboxes to investigate \nsimulated pitting on the pitch line of a gear tooth using an EDM process. For both set-ups \nan AE sensor with resonant frequency 280KHz was employed. In addition, an \naccelerometer was also used for comparative purposes. It was interesting to note that both \nthe accelerometer and AE sensor were placed on the gearbox casing. The first experiment \nemployed a \u201cGenerator Drive Offset Quill\u201d which is used on some UH-1 helicopters. The \ngear ratio was 41:55 and the speed was maintained constant at 1400rpm. A simulated pit \nwas introduced at the pitch line (using EDM) in just one tooth, with dimensions 1.25mm \ndepth and 1.25mm diameter. During background noise test it was observed that a \nreduction in rotational speed to 920rpm resulted in a decrease in background AE \namplitude. An increase in speed also increased the background noise levels. The second \nset-up was a back-to-back gearbox with gear ratio 1.5 (42\/28 teeth) and speeds of \n1775rpm and 2662rpm. In this set-up no fault was introduced. Pitting started to appear \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nafter about half an hour. Periodic AE activity was observed and it was concluded that the \nAE activity resulted from contact over the pitted region.  Singh et al concluded that AE \nprovided early pit detection over vibration monitoring.  \n \nYet further investigations were undertaken by Singh et al [13] to establish the \napplicability of AE to crack growth detection and investigate the transmissibility of AE \nsignals across several mechanical interfaces in the gearbox. The first part of the \ninvestigation centered on single tooth bending tests. The load on the tooth varied \nsinusoidally at 40Hz frequency and the number of cycles recorded. The amplitude of the \nAE signal was monitored in real time and stored electronically until breakage occurred.  \nDuring the bending test an accelerometer was also used to monitor vibration level. The \ntest showed that AE signal could detect crack initiation and growth while the \naccelerometer could detect the crack growth only in the later stages. \n \nThe second part of the experiment involved accessing the transmissibility of AE within \nthe gearbox. Several transmission paths were investigated and lead pencil breaks were \nused to simulate AE activity in the gears. Tests were untaken at varying torque levels and \nit was observed that at light loads greater attenuation was observed relative to heavily \nloaded conditions. In addition, it was noted that at high loads the rate of attenuation \nremained fairly constant. Attenuation of 19dB was observed across the gear mesh and a \ntotal loss of up to 45dB was noted from the gear mesh to the bearing housing. This loss \nwas an accumulation of losses across individual interfaces, e.g., shaft-spline interface.  \n \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nThe papers reviewed clearly demonstrate that AE has the potential of becoming a useful \ndiagnostic complimentary tool for condition monitoring of gears. \n \n \n2. Experimental set-up \n \nThe test-rig employed consisted of two identical oil-bath lubricated gearboxes, connected \nin back-to-back arrangement, see figure 1. The gear set employed were made of 045M15 \nsteel, with no heat treatment, employed  a module of 3mm, a pressure angle of 20\u00b0, \nsurface roughness of between 2-3\u00b5m and had 49 and 65 teeth. Each gearbox had four \nidentical ball bearings. A simple mechanism that permitted a pair of coupling flanges to \nbe rotated relative to each other, and locked in position, was employed to apply torque to \nthe gears. The effect of this process was to twist the shafts and lock in the torque within \nthe loop of the back-to-back gearbox. The effective torque loading was a combination of \nthe static and dynamic (inertia) loading. A fixed torque was used for all experimental \ninvestigations. The motor used to drive the gearbox was a variable speed (2.2Kwatts)  \nmotor with a maximum rotational speed of 2820rpm.  \n \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \n \n \nFigure 1 Test-rig gearbox arrangement \n \n \nThe AE sensors used for this experiment were resonant type sensors with a relative flat \nresponse in the region between 150KHz to 750KHz (Nano-30 model, \u2018Physical Acoustics \nCorporation\u2019). One sensor was placed on the driven gear wheel (49 teeth) and the other \non the ball-bearing casing of the driven gear wheel shaft. The cable connecting the sensor \nplaced on the gear with the pre-amplifier was feed into the shaft and connected to a slip \nrig, see figure 2. This arrangement allowed the AE sensor to be placed as close as \npossible to the gear teeth. Both sensors were held in place with mechanical fixtures. A \nPH-12 slip rig manufactured by \u2018IDM Electronics Ltd\u2019 was employed. The slip rig could \naccommodate up to 12 channels and used silver contacts. The cooling Air Pressure for \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nthe slip ring was 1.4kg\/cm2, see figure 3. Pre-amplification ranged from 40 to 60dB. The \nsignal output from the pre-amplifier was connected (i.e. via BNC\/coaxial cable) directly \nto a commercial data acquisition card. This acquisition card provided up to 8 MHz \nsampling rate and incorporated 16-bit precision giving a dynamic range of more than 85 \ndB. Prior to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the card employed anti-aliasing filters \nthat can be controlled directly in software. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 AE sensor located on driven wheel \n \nEnergy and r.m.s values were calculated in real time by the ADC controlling software. \nThe software employed a hardware accelerator so that calculations could be performed in \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nreal time. The hardware accelerator takes each value from the ADC and squares it. The \nresults are added into an accumulator for a programmable time interval, based on the user \nset time constant. At the start of the time interval the accumulator is cleared and at the \nend of the time interval the accumulator value is stored. The r.m.s is then calculated by \ntaking the square root of the sum of the accumulated squared ADC readings. The energy \nvalue computed was equivalent to the area under time the waveform and is measured in \nAtto-Joules. The time interval for acquisition was set at 100msec and the graphical \ndisplay presented in this paper was obtained by averaging 50 acquisitions; in effect, every \npoint on the graph was equivalent to an average value over five-second of acquisition. \n \nFigure 3 Slip ring with compressed air supply \n \nPrior to taking data on the gearbox test-rig the gear sets were run-in for over four hours at \nrotational speed of between 300 to 600rpm. AE background noise was monitored at three \nCompressed air \nsupply \nSlip ring \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nrotational speeds, 600, 1300 and 1800rpm. In addition, observations of AE activity due to \nmisalignment and natural pitting are detailed. \n \n3. Observations and discussions on background noise \n \nDuring tests AE background noise measurements for defect free gears were recorded. \nThree speeds at a fixed torque were investigated and the results, with the sensor placed on \nthe driven wheel and the bearing casing of the driven wheel shaft, are detailed in figures \n4 to 7.  \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nTime (Hrs)\nr.m.s values as a function of rotational speed\nr.\nm\n.s \n(V\nol\nts\n)\nSpeed 600rpm \nSpeed 1800rpm \nSpeed 1300rpm \n \nFigure 4 Relationship between AE r.m.s and speed for background noise with \nsensor on the driven wheel \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nx 10\n7\nTime (Hrs)\nEn\ner\ngy\n (a\nJ)\nEnergy levels as a function of rotational speed\nSpeed 600rpm \nSpeed 1800rpm \nSpeed 1300rpm \n \nFigure 5 Relationship between AE energy and speed for background noise with \nsensor on the driven wheel \n \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\nTime (Hrs)\nr.\n m\n. s\n.

The \ndifference in levels of AE r.m.s and energy due to the position of the receiving sensor \nwas attributed to attenuation. Furthermore, whilst a change in speed resulted in a \nrelatively instanteneous significant increase in AE r.m.s and energy value, a gradual \ndecrease in these values to an underlying base level was observed. \n \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nThis gradual decrease was more evident with AE data capatured from the driven gear \nwheel. It was also noted that for the sensor placed on the driven wheel, the AE r.m.s and \nenergy values associated with a rotational speed of 1300rpm showed relatively more \nactivity that at other speeds, see figures 4 and 5. This was attributed to the fact that \nresonance of the geared system, which was approximately 1150rpm, generated larger \nexcitations of the system, resulting in an increase in AE variation about a mean value. \nWhilst these results are in agreement with Singh [12], this is the only publication that \nshows the instantaneous effect of change in speed on AE values in real time on a \ngearbox. Clearly, it suggest that whilst changes in operating conditions result in changes \nof AE parameters, there is a gradual \u2018settling in\u2019 period in which the measured AE values \ndecrease to a base level, albeit higher or lower than the previous process condition. The \ngradual settling period is attributed to the gearbox reacting and accommodating the \nchange in dynamic characteristics. \n \n \n4. Observations and discussions on misalignment \n \nWhilst undertaking experimental tests a set of gears was replaced and background noise \nreadings were undertaken prior to continuing with the investigative programmes \nscheduled. At 1300rpm, following the instantaneous rise in AE r.m.s and energy, the AE \nvalues gradually decreased as had been observed earlier (see section 3). However, just as \nthe AE values were showing indications of reaching a base level, the values began to rise \nand trend upwards, see figures 8 and 9. The authors continued the experiment and \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nmonitored the AE activity. After approximately 6-hours of continuous running and data \nacquisition, it was thought prudent to pause the acquisition system and inspect the gear \nsets. This was accomplished by removing the gearbox case only. Evidence of pitting and \nscuffing were visible, see figures 10 and 11, all of which were indications of \nmisalignment. The authors, having observed this, replaced the gearbox case and \ncontinued to run the test-rig and acquire AE data. The rig was paused for approximately \none hour in total. Following reassembly the rig was restarted at 1300rpm and the \nacquisition system armed. A reduction in AE r.m.s and energy values were observed \ninitially, see figures 10 and 11, but it was very interesting to note that these values \ngradually increased to values which did not detract from the initial gradient of increasing \ntrend. This observation showed the AE values continued to rise irrespective of the pause \nin operation and vindicates the robustness of the technique for machine diagnosis. \n \nEventually the AE activity levelled off after 11 hours of operation. At this stage the \ngearbox speed was increased to 1800rpm for a short duration after which the gear was \nvisually inspected. Increased pitting and wear were evident, see figure 12. The settling of \nAE values after such a prolonged period of increase is attributed to the establishment of a \nconstant rate of wear. It is worth noting that the levels of AE r.m.s and energy are greater \nwith misalignment than observed for background noise under defect free condition. \nSentoku\u2019s [10] findings that AE activity increased with increasing wear have been \nverified. In addition, it was observed that the rate of increase in AE values reached a \nmaximum, and remained at this level for over four-hours. \n \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \n \n \n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nTime (Hrs)\nr.\nm\n.s\n.

Conclusion \n \nThis paper has demonstrated the applicability of AE to gear health diagnosis. The \nbehavior of AE to changes in speed or process in real time has been presented. \nFurthermore, it has been demonstrated that gear defect can be diagnosed from the bearing \ncasings. Results of this ongoing work will be subject to future publications. \n \n \nNDT and E International, 36 (7), pp. 471-477, 2003 \nReferences \n \n \n1.
