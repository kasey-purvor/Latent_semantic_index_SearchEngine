This paper describes not only how interested the students were in the extra material\nprovided online in both the conferencing and Web environments, but also how beneficial they felt each\nmedium was to their learning. The tutors' perceptions of their students' participation with these online\nfacilities is also discussed\nIntroduction\nA teaching project using Computer-Mediated Communication (CMQ to aid students'\nunderstanding of computer science took place from February to November 1995 at the\nOpen University. The project fell within that of STILE (Students' and Teachers' Integrated\nLearning Environment), and the course was M205 - STILE: Fundamentals of Computing.\nFour different institutions were involved: the Universities of Leicester, Loughborough, De\nMontfort and the Open University (Ruggles, 1995; Ruggles et al, 1995; Underwood et al,\n1996; Zhao et al, 1996). One of the main aims of the Open University implementation was\nto improve the presentation of the computer science course by enabling structured access\nto online facilities for both tutor-to-student and student-to-student communication. The\nnine tutors and 110 computer science students were situated nationwide and in Europe. In\nline with our partners, we used the Netscape browser version 1 revision N, with Trumpet\nversion 2 revision B. Although use of the Web for teaching and learning was underpinned\nby a wealth of literature about hypertext and hypermedia (see Nielsen 1993; Laurillard,\n1994), it did not successfully sustain conferencing in 1995. Therefore we also adopted the\nFirstClass conferencing system (version 2.6) to accommodate our distance-learning\nstudents.\n52\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 2\nThis paper discusses a second-stage evaluation of the project, following on from Wilson\nand Whitelock (1996). Here we compare student and tutor reactions to the World Wide\nWeb presentation of the course (using Netscape) as contrasted with perceptions of the\ncurriculum delivered via the FirstClass conferencing system. The provision of extra\nmaterial enabled us to evaluate how interested the tutors and students were in the facilities\nprovided, and which format they found more beneficial for their teaching and learning.\nResults\nA range of empirical findings are presented here, to address the following issues:\n\u2022 interest in materials provided by FirstClass (Blocks 1 to 4);\n\u2022 interest in materials provided by the Web (Block 5);\n\u2022 how beneficial it was to have access to both FirstClass and Netscape;\n\u2022 how the tutors rated the online course material and each medium with respect to the\nstudents' method of learning.\nA number of evaluation techniques were used to access these issues, including monitoring\nonline questionnaires completed during and after the tutors' and students' online\nexperiences, student comments, and a questionnaire designed to probe the tutors' and\nstudents' perceptions of the learning experience with respect to the Web and conferencing\npresentations of the course material.\nStudent interest in the online material in FirstClass (Blocks I to 4)\nIn order to access how interested the students were in the computer science material\nprovided in FirstClass, we asked the 58 students who remained online for the duration of\nthe course how interested they were in using this extra material to help with their learning.\nThe response rate was 84 per cent. See Figure 1.\nThe students were very interested in the extra exercises and answers provided in FirstClass,\n73 per cent rating their interest in the material at 3 and above (range 1 to 5, 5 = very\ninterested). In fact when these students were questioned on a separate occasion about how\nthey used M205 - STILE, 17 per cent reported that one of their main reasons for using this\nsystem was to have access to the extra material provided.\nfigure I: Student interest in the\nBlocks I to 4 FirstClass material\nto help their study ofM205\no\n0\nE\na\nc\nto\ne\n\u2022g\no\nt\u00bb0)\n3\no-\n15 i\n10-\nn .\nu *\n1 \u2022 1\n5' A\nscale of 1\nILx.\n3\nto 5.\n2 1\n5 -veryinterested\nS3\nTina Wilson and Denise Whitelock Hijacking hypermedia and other highways to learn computer science\nStudent interest in the online Web material (Block 5)\nWith the Web, one teaching block of material was provided online in August, when students\nhad become more confident with using online facilities. Only 40 per cent of the total number\nof students used the Web materials. This uptake was not unexpected since the software and\nmaterial was introduced quite late in the course. To gauge student perceived interest in the\nBlock 5 Web pages, questionnaires were sent out to the 58 students who were online, and an\n81 per cent response rate was obtained (see Figure 2). Student responses were mixed and\nfairly evenly spread through the range, but 53 per cent reported that they were interested in\nthe Web material, rating their interest at 3 and above. However some students did not know if\nthe material was helpful to their study of M205, and some reported that they did not access\nthe Block 5 material on the Web. One student commented on the difficulties associated with\nnavigating through Web resources. Indeed, the attractions of the Web could easily allow a\nstudent to become side-tracked, and this suggests that students need to learn new working\npractices to help them overcome the mass of data on the Web.\nHowever, some students did appreciate the freedom to explore the course material via\nNetscape, and ventured outside the four university STILE sites to find something they\nwere looking for. These points raise the issue of how much students should be guided in\ntheir use of the Web, and how much should be left to the own desire to adopt a discovery-\nlearning approach. Such pedagogical and software design issues need to be addressed in\nfuture presentations of courses on the Web.\no\n0)\n.aE\n3\nCO\ns1e\no\nto\nO\ncr\n12-,\n10 -\n8-\n6-\nA-\n2-\n0-\n.^  \u2022 ^\n\u2022 \u2022 1 \u2022 11 1 1 1 1 1\nscale of 1 to 5. 5 = very interested\nm -n\nCO $\n3 \u00a3\nFigure 2: Student interest in the\nBlock 5 Web pages to help their\nstudy ofM205\nStudent perceptions of the benefits of access to both the Web and FirstClass\nStudents were asked if they found it beneficial to have access to both FirstClass and\nNetscape. Questionnaires were sent out to the 58 students who were still online, the\nresponse rate of 83 per cent. See Figure 3. The majority of students felt that it was\nbeneficial to have used both FirstClass and the Web. The students who participated in this\nproject were given two new media to assist with their course work. In general Open\nUniversity students are keen to adopt a new medium. We must bear in mind therefore that\nanswers to this question could be affected by the students' perception that a negative\nresponse could result in either one or both of these facilities being taken away. It must be'\nsaid, however, that a high proportion did not know if it was beneficial to have access to\nboth. Some students felt that FirstClass on its own was beneficial to their course work,\nwhile a significant number saw Netscape as an add-on which was of indirect use: 'Yes.\nFirstClass was excellent for course work and TMA [Tutor |Marked Assessment] problems.\nNetscape was good for looking at the world in general'.\n54\nALT-) Volume 5 Number 2\nOne student commented on the difficulty of comparing the two media:\nI have had little experience of Netscape. Perhaps with a little practice I might find\nNetscape as useful as FirstClass! Yes, FirstClass was great because I had become\ncomfortable with using it, but Netscape led me to explore the outside world.\nThis student mentions the importance of feeling comfortable with the electronic\nenvironment, and in the time allowed for comparison preferred FirstClass. Collis (1996)\ncompares proprietary conferencing software and the facilities provided by the Web. She\nmentions the advantages of computer conferencing environments. From student reactions\nto the Web interface, when compared to FirstClass (see Wilson and Whitelock, 1997), we\nwould surmize that it will be some time before the Web provides an environment as\ncomfortable as FirstClass.\n\u00a3\n\u2022o\n3\no\nQJ\nE\n3\nZ\n25-j\n20-\n15-\n10-\n5-\n0 -\n\u2022^M\n__\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022_\nBoth\nI \u2014\nFirstClass\nonly\nNot\nNetscape\nDon't\nknow\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022MM\n+-\u2022\u2022\u2022-1\nDidn't\naccess\nWeb\nFigure 3: How beneficial it was found to hove access to both FirstQass and Netscape\nTutor perceptions of the benefits of the Web and FirstClass to their students'\nlearning\nWe asked the tutors to score between 1 and 5 (5 = very beneficial) how beneficial they felt\nFirstClass was to their students (see Figure 4).

Questionnaires were sent out online to the nine tutors at the\nend of the presentation. Eight responded. Their comments referred to the material in\n55\nTina Wilson and Denise Whitelock Hijacking hypermedia and other highways to learn computer science\nFirstClass, and they did not comment on whether the Block 5 Web material could be\nmodified (see below). Although the tutors used the conferencing facilities to negotiate the\ndesign and presentation of the online materials for FirstClass, the material chosen may\nnot have worked as well as expected. They found it difficult to know how they could\nimprove the type and presentation of these materials. Six were unable to suggest\nimprovements, and one tutor's comment captures their thoughts:\nI have no strong views on this. I am sure there is always room for improvement, but\nwhether the increase in effectiveness would justify the effort I can't say.\nThe other two tutors who responded were not convinced that the exercises and answers\npresented in the FirstClass environment were helpful. As one tutor put it; 'the online\nmaterial presented was more of the same rather than anything new and exciting'.\nWe then asked the tutors to score between 1 and 5 how beneficial they felt the Web was to\ntheir students (see Figure 5).\n2\nito\n9\nha\nID\n\u2022O\nE\n3\ne\n3 \u2022\n2-\n1 -\n0-\nin e>\nscale of 1 to 5. 5 >\n_ \u2022\n. ^ I_1^^H_I\n= very beneficial\nFigure 5: How beneficial tutors\nfelt the Web was for their\nstudents\nFive felt that the Web may have been beneficial, and three did not know. This was probably\nmore due to the fact that they themselves did not have time to explore the Web fully (see\nWilson and Whitelock, 1997).\nDiscussion\nThe Web conferencing facilities were limited in 1995, and we had to advocate the use of\ntwo systems for M205 - STILE, one for conferencing and email and one for Web access. It\nhas been suggested, however, that the Web even in 1997 is still not a very good medium for\nconferencing: Collis (1996) discusses the benefits of computer conferencing as compared\nto the Web environment for course organisation; hypertext systems, proprietary conferenc-\ning systems and the Web are discussed by Laurillard (1994), Naidu et al (1995), Cohen\n(1996) and Nkambou and Gauthier (1996).\nThe tutors involved in M205 - STILE were able to attain a level of experience with FirstClass\nbefore the students came online. This enabled them to help and encourage the students to use\nthe system. However, because of the time constraints which meant that the tutors did not have\na comparable amount of time to become familiar with the Web-based facilities before the\nstudents started to use them, they could not influence their students to use it more. We would\nrecommend in future that the tutors are taught how to use the Web first and given time to\nbecome familiar with the system and the culture before the students come online. Nevertheless,\nthe tutors were more aware of the pedagogical advantages of FirstClass as a discursive medium\nas compared to the Web facility which did not provide a conferencing forum.\n56\nAu-J Volume 5 Number 2\nThe students found that it was not the lack of pedagogy in the materials that was a problem\nbut the lack of an integrated system (with one interface). One student commented:\nI found that FirstClass was more beneficial. If someone posted any material it was\neasier to reply to, without having to remember his address, enter FirstClass and then\nprepare a message.\nHe found it easier to use FirstClass for all his activities rather than using the Web and then\nhaving to use FirstClass. In a sense this mirrored what the tutors believed about the\nadvantages of FirstClass as a discursive medium, and it also explains why the tutors rated\nFirstClass highly beneficial to their students' learning while some did not know if the Web\nwas beneficial at all.\nThe tutors could not suggest how the FirstClass online material could be improved except by\nthe introduction of a compulsory element where students would be marked for their\nparticipation. This point is discussed by Mason (1994). Perhaps if participation was made\ncompulsory, assessed and made, part of normal study with the Open University, it would\nbecome part of the accepted culture. One student who would like to have tried electronic\nsubmission of TMAs suggested that the facilities would need to be improved and be easy to\nuse to enable students to submit electronic assignments: 'It seems very feasible that TMAs\ncould be transmitted electronically, however I think you may have to provide students with\nsuitable tools.' In the case of the online Web material, the tutors did not know enough about\nthe Web to comment on how it could be improved.\nOur findings suggest that with new media students need to be taught different working\npractices and be given easy-to-use tools and guidance to achieve their aims. This is\nespecially true of information on the Web which is not always thoroughly vetted and can\nresult in a maze of information of dubious quality. Since the start of 1995, technology has\nmoved forward in both the FirstClass and Web environments, and it will be possible to\nintegrate these two systems more easily in the future; for example conferences in FirstClass\nare already being replicated on the Web. The pedagogical benefits of audio on the Web and\nvoice mail in FirstClass need further investigation. Although the technologies are\nconverging, at this preliminary design stage of our Web environment we see the adoption\nof an Interactive Media Facilitator (or IMF, see Wilson and Whitelock, 1996) as crucial to\nthe future development of this culture for teaching and learning.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank all nine tutors involved in M205 - STILE, especially those who\ndesigned the extra material for FirstClass: Diana Worster, Gerry Hayden, Tony Dickinson,\nElizabeth Broumley, and George McLeod who prepared the extra material for the Web.
