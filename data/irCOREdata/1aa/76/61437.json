In Northern England, the Ripon Bypass crosses Permian strata affected by active \ngypsum karst and severe subsidence problems. Here, the initial borehole site investigation for the road was \nsupplemented by resistivity tomography studies. The roadway was reinforced with two layers of tensile membrane \nmaterial within the earth embankment. This will prevent dangerous catastrophic collapse, but will allow sagging to \nshow where problems exist. The River Ure Bridge was constructed across an area of subsidence pipes filled with \nalluvial deposits. It was built with extra strength, larger than normal foundations. If one pier fails the bridge is \ndesigned for adjacent arches to span the gap without collapse. The bridge piers are also fitted with electronic load \nmonitoring to warn of failure. In the Midlands area of England, road construction over Triassic gypsum has required \na phase of ground improvement on the Derby Southern Bypass. Here, the gypsum caps a hill where it was formerly \nmined; it dips through a karstic dissolution zone into an area of complete dissolution and collapse. The road and an \nassociated flyover were built across these ground conditions. A major grouting program before the earthworks began \ntreated the cavities in the mine workings and the cavernous margin of the gypsum mass. Within the karstic \ndissolution zone gypsum blocks and cavities along the route were identified by conductivity and resistivity \ngeophysical surveys, excavated and backfilled. In the areas of complete dissolution and collapse the road foundation \nwas strengthened with vibrated stone columns and a reinforced concrete road deck was used. \n \nINTRODUCTION \nGypsum (CaSO4 .2H2O) is readily soluble in water and develops karst features \nmuch more quickly than does limestone. Road construction over gypsiferous terranes \nhas to deal with karst problems including progressive dissolution, sinkhole formation \nand poor ground conditions caused by collapsed strata. Furthermore, the complete \ndissolution of gypsiferous beds can leave a residue of weak and brecciated strata which \nalso produces difficult conditions for construction. Where gypsum is present in the \nbedrock, either as massive beds or as veins, it can be associated with sulphate-rich \ngroundwater that can be harmful to concrete, and precautions to prevent damage should be \nconsidered (Forster et al., 1995).  \nThe Permian and Triassic strata in England both contain thick gypsum sequences, \nbut individually their associated rocks and respective engineering problems are \ndifferent. The most problematical gypsum karst conditions are found in the Permian \nrocks, notably in the Ripon area of North Yorkshire. Gypsum karst and difficult ground \nconditions have been encountered in the Triassic rocks of the English Midlands in the \narea to the south-west of Derby. These are described below with details of the \ndifficulties encountered during road construction and their engineering solutions.  \n \nRIPON BYPASS \nGeology and gypsum karst problems \nThe Ripon Bypass was constructed to the east of Ripon. It crosses the Permian \nsequence which includes approximately 35m of gypsum in the Edlington Formation \n(formerly the Middle Marl) and 10m of gypsum in  the  higher  Roxby Formation (formerly  \n \nFigure 1. The distribution of the Permian and Triassic gypsiferous sequences in the \nUnited Kingdom and locations of the Ripon Bypass and the Derby Southern Bypass. \nNottingham \nGypsiferous strata \nHartlepool \nCarlisle \nRipon \nDoncaster \nDerby \nTriassic \nPermian \nDerby S. \nBypass \nRipon  \nBypass \nthe Upper Marl).  These two gypsum sequences rest on two limestone aquifers, the Cadeby Formation (formerly the Lower Magnesian \nLimestone) and the Brotherton Formation (formerly the Upper Magnesian Limestone) respectively. The limestone dip slopes act as \ncatchment areas and the underground water flows down-dip into the gypsiferous sequences, before escaping into a major buried valley \nalong the line of the Rive Ure (Cooper, 1986, 1995, 1998). Complex cave systems have developed in the gypsum, and artesian, sulphate-\nrich springs are locally present.  Because of the thickness of gypsum the caves are large and surface collapses up to 30m across and 20m \ndeep have been recorded.  The subsidence is not random, but occurs in a reticulate pattern related to the jointing in the underlying strata \n(Cooper, 1986). However, it is impossible to predict where the next subsidence event will occur. Around Ripon, a significant subsidence \noccurs approximately every year (Cooper, 1995). The dates of the subsidence events show that some areas are more active than others, \nespecially areas bounding the Ure valley where cave water escapes into the buried valley gravels. The new Ripon Bypass crosses the \nsubsidence belt and the new Ure Bridge is situated in a very active area. The new road and bridge pass close to several subsidence hollows.   \n \nEngineering solutions \nIn addition to the standard site investigation that was undertaken for the Ripon Bypass, a desk study of the subsidence features \nwas carried out. This study included an assessment of the likely magnitude and frequency of the subsidence events along the route of \nthe road. Resistivity tomography was also undertaken on the bridge site, but the results were inconclusive and no additional \nsubsidence features were pinpointed. Even if a costly investigation of closely spaced boreholes had been undertaken, it is unlikely that \nany cavities or breccia pipes which were identified could be stabilised. Grouting was impractical due to the large size of the cavities \nand the fact that filling them was likely to cause accelerated dissolution in the adjacent ground. Because the line of the bridge could \nnot be changed a decision was made to design and construct the bridge with inbuilt protection against future ground subsidence. \nA conventional bridge in a non-hazardous area would comprise piers with individual sections of road deck (Figure 2A). The new \nRipon Bridge has a strengthened heavy-duty steel girder construction designed with sacrificial supporting piers. The structure will \nwithstand the loss of any one support pier without collapsing (Figure 2B), (Thomson et al., 1996). The individual piers have larger \nthan normal foundation pads, in order to span a small subsidence event. On the alluvial deposits of the river flood plain the ground \nwas improved by the use of stone columns. Piling was also undertaken for one of the piers. In addition to the bridge strengthening, the \npiers are equipped with electronic monitoring devices to detect separation from the deck. The philosophy of the approach has been to \nmaintain public safety, while not over-engineering the structure to an excessive degree with the resultant heavy financial costs. In \naddition to these measures, an added degree of security could have been obtained by extending the foundations of each pier laterally to \nan extent that could span the normal-sized collapses (Figure 2C). \n \n \nFigure 2. Sacrificial supports and extended foundations in \nbridge construction to protect against sudden subsidence \nfailure. \nFigure 3.

The course of the road could not be \nchanged as it follows a disused railway line. The solution was to use tension membranes with a design brief that the integrity of the \nroad should be supported for at least a 24-hour period following ground subsidence (Kempton, et al., 1996). This would allow time for \nany problem to be identified and isolated from the public. The tension membrane material, or geogrid, used was ParaLink 700S and \n325S incorporated in the road embankment (Kempton, et al., 1996: Thomson et al., 1996). The embankment\/membrane combination \nwas modelled using a FLAC (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) computer programme to simulate the occurrence of a typically \nsized collapse void beneath the road (Kempton, et al., 1996).  The incorporation of these membranes in the road will allow the road to \nsag into any subsidence void beneath it, thus showing there is a problem, but catastrophic collapse should not occur (Figure 3). The \nuse of geotextile materials in this way is a proven method of protecting public safety in car parks and public spaces. \n \nDERBY SOUTHERN BYPASS    \nGeology and gypsum karst problems \nThe Derby Southern Bypass is a 24km long strategic link road between the M1, near Derby, to the M6 at Stafford.  It includes 72 \nmajor engineered structures, and the design and supervision of the construction works was carried out by Scott Wilson on behalf of the \nHighways Agency. The road crosses the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group of rocks (formerly called the Keuper Marl), that are mainly \nsandstones and calcareous or dolomitic mudstones, with two main sequences of gypsum in the upper part of the group. These are the \nTutbury and Newark gypsum beds of the Cropwell Bishop Formation (Elliot 1961; Charsley et al. 1990).  \nThe Mercia Mudstone Group has a reputation for having complex weathering and requiring careful site investigation (Chandler, 1969; \nBacciarelli, 1993). In some places, the rock has a low bearing capacity and a complex weathering profile with less weathered rock \ncommonly overlying severely weathered material. In some parts of the sequence this can be attributed to differently cemented strata. \nElsewhere, this weathering may be attributed to the dissolution of gypsum in the near-surface strata, possibly to a depth of 30m (Elliot, \n1961; Reeves, et al., 1993).  In these areas, caution has to be exercised as engineering works, such as piling, may open channels for water \ningress into the gypsiferous strata.  If this happens, and there is a throughput of water, gypsum dissolution may occur similar to that \nrecorded at Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station, near Nottingham (Seedhouse and Sanders, 1993). \n \nFigure 4. Stylised cross-section (not to scale) through the Tutbury Gypsum, mine workings and gypsum dissolution zone at Aston Hill \nsouth-west of Derby on the Derby Southern Bypass. \n \nThe Tutbury gypsum is best developed in the area south and southwest of Derby where it reaches about 10m in thickness. The \noverlying Newark gypsum here comprises mainly thin beds and veins. The thick Tutbury gypsum bed has a long history of mining and \nquarrying dating back to the Middle Ages.

From the 19th Century onwards it was increasingly exploited for \nplaster manufacture (Smith, 1918; Sherlock & Hollingworth, 1938). There are still several working gypsum mines extracting the Tutbury \nseam in the region, but not locally. The Tutbury gypsum is not well documented, but the descriptions of Smith (1918) record much of it as \nmassive and nodular. Features that we now consider to be of karst origin are also described including dissolution features and areas of \ncollapse. In the gypsum mines at Fauld, about 20km to the south-west of the construction site, Wynne (1906) described caves and collapse \nfeatures similar to those seen in the Permian gypsum of the Vale of Eden (Ryder and Cooper, 1993).  \nThe construction of the Derby Southern Bypass, near Aston-on-Trent, took the main east-west carriageway along the base of Aston \nHill with an interchange linking it to the A6 Derby Spur road. The associated slip roads for the spur passed through a deep cutting in the \nnorthern flank of the hill. Available published geological maps (British Geological Survey, 1976: now resurveyed) and unpublished \ndocuments were consulted during the initial desk study and subsequent design stages. They indicated that the workings of the Aston Holme \nGypsum Mine beneath the hill would underlie the slip roads. They also suggested that the gypsum dipped about 3 degrees to the north and \nwould crop out on the side of the hill in the middle of the cutting. The detailed ground investigations showed the mainline of the road to be \nunderlain by up to 8m of soft to very soft clays and silts. These belonged to the Mercia Mudstone Group, had low bearing capacities and a \nlong-term settlement potential. The ground investigation showed the gypsum workings beneath Aston Hill to be above the groundwater \ntable. For safety reasons, it was decided that the mine workings should be treated by a phase of drilling and grouting prior to the excavation \nof the cutting. This was because of the potential for significant voids to be encountered at various levels during the earthworks, a factor that \nwould pose a risk to personnel and heavy construction traffic. \nDuring the drilling and grouting programme, it became apparent that the Tutbury seam was in fact present at a greater depth than \nindicated by the published geological records. However, the final rockhead cover was insufficient to negate any long-term risk of void \nmigration. In addition, during the initial earthworks for the main carriageways three minor collapses were encountered. These three areas \nwere investigated by a grid of 12 drill-holes to depths of between 15m and 30m. No gypsum was encountered and grout takes were \nminimal. It was concluded that the gypsum seam was present at a depth greater than originally envisaged and that it passed beneath the \nmainline of the road (Figure 4). It was concluded that the gypsum mine workings were not restricted by the seam outcrop, on the side of \nAston Hill, but by a zone of dissolution at the edge of the mine. Down dip from the mine, the gypsum passes into a zone of partial \ndissolution and collapsed strata. This comprises a mixture of large, partially dissolved gypsum blocks up to 4m in diameter, collapsed areas \nand some natural cavities. Further down dip, beneath the River Trent floodplain the gypsum has been totally dissolved resulting in a \nsequence of insoluble residue and collapsed confining strata. The sequence formerly associated with the gypsum is present as a mixture of \nsoft to very soft clay with brecciated mudstone clasts. Deep boreholes showed that farther down dip, where there was little groundwater \ncirculation, the gypsum had not been dissolved and was again present. Some of the subsidence hollows encountered during the excavations \ncontained glacial and periglacial deposits. It is probable that the karst mechanisms that dissolved the gypsum may be related to past \nfluctuations in the groundwater levels. These fluctuations might relate to decreasing water table levels associated with post-glacial river \nincision and a change in base level. This is suggested by the presence of extensive stepped terraces along the valley here.  \n \nEngineering solutions \nThe area of mine workings and partial dissolution beneath the slip road area was treated by a phase of drilling and grouting. At the \nstart, a perimeter grout curtain was formed by grouting holes initially at 3m centres, reduced to 1.5m centres in areas of significant grout \ntake. The enclosed area was then grouted on an initial 6m grid with secondary grouting at 3m centres in areas of significant grout take. \nTertiary grouting was undertaken at 1.5m centres for areas of significant grout take during the secondary phase. The boreholes were drilled \nby open-hole percussive techniques and air flush. Grouting was achieved by the installation into the boreholes of a tube, nominally 50mm \nin diameter, with an inflatable packer. Grout was injected at a maximum pressure of 965kPa (140 psi). Approximately 2900 holes were \ndrilled to a maximum depth of 32m and an average depth of 20m. The maximum void height encountered was 7.5m with several migrating \nvoids encountered at depths as shallow as 2m below original ground level. \nThe mainline carriageway and approach roads to the A6 Derby Spur Bridge were in an area of complete gypsum dissolution and soft \nstrata. Here, the foundation strata were improved by the installation of 450mm diameter stone columns on a grid to a typical depth of 10m. \nIn addition, sections of the mainline carriageway were constructed using a continuously reinforced concrete carriageway to span any minor \nlocalised shallow subsidence.  \nBecause the Tutbury gypsum seam was found beneath all the slip roads and the mainline of the road, it was deemed prudent to carry \nout a two-phase geophysical survey to look for possible cavities and soft ground. The geophysics comprised ground conductivity and \nground resisitivity techniques undertaken over approximately 900m of highway route. The survey identified two areas where anomalies \nwere encountered at depths of between 6m to 8m below finished road level. These were correlated to possible voids and water-filled \nground, or zones of very soft clay. The anomalies affected a total length of 75m of highway and these areas were treated by the installation \nof stone columns.    \n  \nDISCUSSION \nThe construction of bridges and viaducts over actively dissolving gypsum karst is difficult. Unlike the relatively slow formation \nof limestone karst, gypsum karst can develop on a human\/engineering time-scale. Furthermore, the site investigation of cavernous \nground is difficult, especially where thick Quaternary deposits overlie gypsum that is dissolving to depths of 80m or more. Many of \nthe engineering solutions used in limestone karst areas are not appropriate. Grouting is commonly used to fill cavities and stabilise the \nground in limestone karst, but in gypsum karst it can only be used in areas like the Derby Southern Bypass where there is very little \ngroundwater movement. Where there is high groundwater movement, such as at Ripon, the high dissolution rate of gypsum, the \naggressive nature of sulphate-rich water, the cavity sizes and the difficulties of actually sealing them make grouting impractical. \nIncomplete grouting may actually aggravate the situation by causing enhanced dissolution in the adjacent ground around the treated \narea. Because grouting is largely ineffective it can be argued that in many areas exhaustive site investigation to find the cavities is not \ncost-effective, unless the road can be re-routed to avoid them. The alternative approach is to look for the obvious problems, such as \nknown sinkholes, avoid them and build strength and safety measures into the structures; this is the approach that was taken by the road \nengineers at Ripon. A similar approach has been taken by French engineers for road construction around Paris. Some of the gypsum \nkarst has been grouted (Cadilhac et al., 1997; Poupelloz & Toulemont, 1981), but additional safety measures have also been used. \nViaducts around Paris have been constructed with foundations that will span the likely size of collapse (Arnould, 1970). In addition, \nbenchmarks to monitor movement have been installed and these are surveyed regularly. A network of inclinometers and \nextensometers are automatically monitored and linked to a warning system that is activated if the settlement exceeds 60mm. During \nthe viaduct construction all known cavities were filled, but the structures were also designed with grout-holes for future possible use to \nenable new cavities to be grouted (Arnould, 1970). The similar use of extended foundation designs and strengthened structures has \nsimilarly been used in Germany and Russia (Reuter and Tolma\u010d\u00ebv, 1990; Sorochan, et al., 1985). \nThe complete dissolution of gypsum also leads to problems where construction has to deal with the residual deposits caused by \ngypsum removal and collapse. In the UK, where this process has occurred in the Mercia Mudstone Group it has commonly produced \nground with a low bearing capacity. The distinctive weathered character of the Mercia Mudstone has been known for some time \n(Chandler, 1969; Bacciarelli, 1993). However, very little attention has been paid to the presence of gypsum in the unweathered rock, \nits removal by dissolution and the resultant deposits. The excavations on the Derby Southern Bypass show the effects of dissolution \nremoving thick gypsum deposits and the resultant soft, collapsed ground. Gypsum is not uniformly distributed throughout the Mercia \nMudstone Group and it is likely that there is some correlation between the areas with the lowest bearing capacity, the stratigraphy and \nthe former presence of gypsum.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe Highways Agency and Scott Wilson are thanked for permission to publish construction details of the Derby Southern Bypass. \nTim Charsley, Alan Forster and Dave Entwhistle are thanked for reviewing the manuscript.
