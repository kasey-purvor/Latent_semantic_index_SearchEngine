The focus is mainly on macromolecule transport at low number densities\nwhich is frequently encountered in biomedical devices such as separators, and\ndetection and analysis systems. Modelling the transport process is a challenging\nproblem due to the wide range of physical scales involved. On one hand, the continuum\napproach is not valid for low solute concentrations and, on the other hand, the large time\nscales of the fluid flow make molecular simulations prohibitively expensive. The\nproposed multi-scale modelling strategy enables simulation of individual\nmacromolecules on macroscopic time scales. The particular class of multi-scale models\nconsidered in this paper is the meta-models. Meta-models are based on the coupled\nsolution of fluid flow equations and equations of motion for a simplified mechanical\nmodel of macromolecules. Meta-models often rely on particle-corrector algorithms,\nwhich impose length constraints on the mechanical model. Lack of robustness of the\nparticle-corrector algorithm employed can lead to slow convergence and numerical\ninstability. A new FAst Linear COrrector (FALCO) algorithm is introduced in this paper,\nwhich significantly improves computational efficiency in comparison with the widely used\nSHAKE algorithm. Validation of the new particle corrector against a simple analytic\nsolution is performed and improved convergence is demonstrated for ssDNA motion in a\nlid-driven micro-cavity.\n3Keywords: multi-scale modelling, DNA, macromolecule transport, meta-modelling,\nparticle corrector.\n1 Introduction\nIn the past decade micro- and nanofluidic devices have emerged as revolutionary tools\nfor a wide range of applications in chemical engineering and bioengineering [1-6].\nMicrofluidic devices are extensively used to enhance mixing [7,8] and separation [9,10],\ndrug delivery [11,12] and bioanalysis systems [13,14]. The transport of macromolecules in\nmicrofluidic devices is relevant to a number of biomedical applications including\nseparation and detection [5,6,15-18]. Numerical modelling of macromolecule transport\nenables prediction and optimisation of microfluidic device performance for a particular\napplication [19-22]. Moreover, simulation results can be directly utilised to guide\nfunctionality-oriented design of microfluidics. The key challenge in the numerical\nmodelling of macromolecule transport in microfluidics lies in the inherently multiscale\nnature of the process, which is governed by a combination of stochastic molecular\nmotion and deterministic macroscopic flow. Different models have been developed in\nthe past to describe transport phenomena occurring on a variety of length scales [23-25].\nPure molecular models [24] provide a detailed description of nanoscale events, however,\nthe computational requirements associated with the molecular modelling [24] would\nprevent in most cases the direct simulation of the interaction of macromolecules with a\ncontinuum scale microflow. On the other side of the scale, macroscale continuum\n4models based on continuum fluid flow equations and additional advection-diffusion\nequation for the molecules concentration field can be utilised [26]. However, many\napplications, in particular bioanalytical and drug delivery systems, feature extremely low\nsolute concentrations [13-14] for which continuum concentration field models are not\nsuitable. An indicative example can be derived from experimental studies of DNA\ntransport in microchannels [18] which indicate that individual DNA strands in a pressure\ndriven microflow tend to migrate to the middle of the microchannel. Contrary to the\nexperimental observations, the application of a continuum level diffusion model would\nresult in spreading the DNA in the microfluidic channel.\nA viable alternative to purely molecular or continuum level description is provided by\nmeta-models which have been applied successfully to polymer science[27].\nMeta-models couple the continuum level flow equations with a mechanical analogue of\nthe macromolecule. The input from molecular models is required for defining the\nparameters of the mechanical structure representing the macromolecule of interest [28].\nThe motion of a macromolecule is then represented by the motion of the corresponding\nmechanical structure in the force field imposed by the flow under a set of geometrical\nconstraints. Efficient and stable numerical implementation of the particle position\ncorrector algorithm, which is applied to impose the geometrical constraints on the\nmoving mechanical structure, is a key to the overall computational efficiency of the\nmeta-model. Trebotich et al. [28] used the SHAKE algorithm to simulate DNA, however\nconvergence problems were observed when an initial guess for the SHAKE algorithm\nwas far from the final corrected particle positions.\n5In this paper, a new FAst Linear COrrector (FALCO) algorithm is proposed. The\nalgorithm is derived from purely geometrical considerations and is based on analogue of\nthe Hooke's law [30] with a variable spring constant. The proposed particle corrector is\nvalidated using the rotating dumbbell problem [31] for which an analytic solution is\navailable and its performance is demonstrated for a coupled motion of an ssDNA\nsegment in a lid-driven micro-cavity flow.\n2 Description of models\nExperimental observations indicate that ssDNA is a relatively flexible biopolymer [32,33].\nTherefore, the mechanical behaviour of ssDNA is predominantly governed by the\nstretching forces and an appropriate mechanical representation can be constructed\nusing the bead-rod model [27], which has been successfully applied to DNA simulations\npreviously [28]. The model is based on the mechanical representation of the\nmacromolecule as a series of N beads connected with rigid rods (Figure 1). The\nmotion of the macromolecule in the fluid flow is then described by the set of Newton\nequations of motion for each individual bead position, ir given by\n[1]\nwhere im is the mass of the bead; iF represents the force exerted on the bead by the\nflow and iG is the constraint force which arises from the bond deviations defined as\n,2\n2\nii\ni\ni dt\nd\nm GF\nr \uf02b\uf03d\n6[2]\nwhere ijd is the prescribed bond length and 1\uf03d\uf02d ji . When the length of the ijth bond\nlji \uf03d\uf02d rr is equal to the prescribed value, there is no constraint force acting on the ith\nand jth beads due to this bond.\nThe equations of motion for the beads have to be solved in conjunction with the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes system [23] comprising mass\n[3]\nand momentum\n[4]\nconservation equations, where p , v , \uf075 and \uf072 denote pressure, fluid velocity,\nkinematic viscosity and density of fluid respectively. bF denotes the external forces\nwhich are exerted on the fluid flow by the macromolecule. These external forces are\ngenerally small in comparison with the convective and viscous terms. Considering the\ncurrent setup, the ratio of convective and external terms is approximately 410 and the\nratio of viscous and external terms is around 710 .\nSeveral models are available for the construction of the total constraint forces vector iG .\nAssuming that each constraint force component acts along the rod connecting\ncorresponding beads and the magnitude of the force is proportional to the difference\nbetween the prescribed and actual bond lengths, it is possible to write the general\nconstraint force (e.g. [27]) acting on the ith bead as\n22)( ijjiij d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d rr\uf073 ,...1, Nji \uf03d ,ji \uf0b9\n0\uf03d\uf0d7\uf0d1 v\nbpt\nFvvv\nv\n\uf072\n\uf075\n\uf072\n11\n)( \uf02b\uf044\uf02b\uf0d1\uf02d\uf03d\uf0d1\uf0d7\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n7[5]\nwhere the parameters ij\uf06c are proportional to the force magnitude and the sum is\ncomputed for all bonds of the ith bead.\nIn the SHAKE algorithm, ij\uf06c are treated as Lagrangian multipliers [29] which are\ndetermined by the requirement that the corresponding length constraints in Eq.

The force then is proportional to the bond elongation with the\ncoefficient of proportionality ji,\uf06c (Eq. (5)).

(6)) and taking into account\nthe bond constraints updated on each iteration\n[14]\nthe FALCO update formula given by Eq. (10) is obtained. In the FALCO algorithm the\nparticle positions are updated inside the iteration loop, which leads to the direction\nvectors being updated at each iteration, whereas the SHAKE algorithm relies on the\ndirection vectors obtained at the previous time-step.. Thus, the FALCO algorithm is less\nsensitive to angular displacements of the bonds. The proposed formulation does not\ninvolve numerical solution of second-order equations, thereby reducing storage\nrequirements and increasing computational efficiency.\n4 Test cases\nIn order to validate the FALCO algorithm and demonstrate its stability, two test cases\nhave been considered: (i) the rotating dumbell problem [31] where an analytic solution is\n.min\n2 ,2\n)(\n, ji\ni\nbondi\nl\nji DLNt\nm \uf0d7\n\uf044\n\uf0d7\uf03d\n\uf0ce\n\uf065\uf06c\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 ,'\n''\n)1(\n2\n,\n2)1()1()(\n,\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf044\uf02b \uf02b\uf0b6\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf0b6\n\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\nl\nii\nji\nl\njj\nl\nii\nl\ntti\nji d\nrr\nrrrr\nr \uf064\n\uf064\uf064\uf073\n11\nreadily available. In this case, the mechanical model moves in a fluid at rest; (ii) a\nssDNA motion in a lid-driven micro-cavity flow. For the second test case, the results\nobtained with SHAKE and FALCO algorithms are compared.\n4.1 Rotating dumbbell\nThe theorem of zero net hydrodynamic force [31] states that the rotation of a non-skew\nbody about any axis passing through its centre of hydrodynamic torque C results in\nzero net hydrodynamic force. The centre of hydrodynamic torque is defined as a point\nwhere the torque CT vanishes in case of placing a fixed dumbbell into a homogeneous,\nuniform velocity field.\nConsider an asymmetric dumbbell in a solid-like vortex with the angular velocity \u03c9\nabout an axis passing through C (Figure 2). Beads 1 and 2 are moving through the\nsurrounding fluid with velocities 1u and 2u respectively. Due to the motion, the beads\nexperience Stokes drag forces given by\n[15]\nwhere \uf068 is the dynamic viscosity and ib is the bead radius.\nThe velocities are given by\n[16]\n,6 iii b uF \uf070\uf068\uf02d\uf03d 2,1\uf03di\n,Cii r\u03c9u \uf0b4\uf03d 2,1\uf03di\n12\nwhich leads to the following expression for the total force\n[17]\nThe location of the centre of hydrodynamic torque C is calculated from the following\nrelation\n[18]\nSubstituting this relation into the formula for the total force given by the Eq. (17) yields\n0F \uf03d , in accordance with the general theorem. A dumbbell with zero initial velocity at\n0\uf03dt should start rotating around its centre of hydrodynamic torque C and accelerate\nuntil its angular velocity reaches that of the flow. The steady state is reached when the\nangular velocity of the dumbbell matches that of the flow. This problem can be used in\norder to validate the implementation of the rigid bond constraint. In the absence of the\nbond constraint, drag forces should result in spiral particle pathlines. Furthermore, an\ninconsistent or biased particle corrector algorithm would result in non-circular particle\ntrajectories.\nTo verify the FALCO algorithm, the accelerating dumbbell problem has been computed\nfor the beads with the radius ratio 0.2\/ 12 \uf03dbb and constant density corresponding to\nbead mass ratio of 0.8\/ 12 \uf03dmm . The angular velocity of the clockwise rotating vortex\nwas set to 0.1 . The bond length was equal to 2.0 . The orbits of the beads over 627\ntime steps formed two concentric circles (Figure 3). The integration error lead to the\n\uf028 \uf029.6 2211 CC bb rr\u03c9F \uf02b\uf0b4\uf02d\uf03d \uf070\uf068\n.2\n1\n2\n1 CC b\nb\nrr \uf02d\uf03d\n13\norbit displacement of %1 after a complete circle for the time step of 01.0 . Figure 4\nshows the deviation of the calculated bond length from the exact value normalised by\nthe prescribed bond length ( 2,1DLN ).\n4.2 ssDNA in lid-driven cavity\nThe flow in a square lid-driven micro-cavity was investigated as an example of a more\npractical scenario of a macromolecule transport. In this case, coupled solution for the\nflow field and the motion of a small ssDNA segment has been obtained. Using the\nbead-rod model, the ssDNA segment was represented by 3 beads connected with rigid\nand freely rotating rods. Simulations were performed for two different values of the time\nstep with both SHAKE and FALCO algorithms. The flow was computed using the\nin-house HIRECOM Navier-Stokes finite-volume solver based on artificial\ncompressibility pressure-velocity coupling approach [34] and a characteristics-based\nhigh-resolution scheme [35]. The solution was integrated in pseudo-time using the\n4th-order Runge-Kutta method and the real-time integration was performed using a\n2nd-order backwards differencing (e.g. [36]).\nAt time 0\uf03dt the ssDNA strand was injected into a developed micro-cavity flow with the\nReynolds number of 10 based on the cavity depth L and the lid velocity U . The\nssDNA was aligned vertically, downwards from the starting point given by 5.00 \uf03dx ,\n2.00 \uf03dy .\nSince the primary aim of the test case was to evaluate the convergence range of the\nalgorithm, the force exerted on the fluid flow by the ssDNA was neglected in order to\n14\nsimplify the problem. Estimates performed for the conditions investigated in this\npaper indicate that this external force is 4 to 7 orders of magnitude smaller than the\nconvective and viscous terms. The stochastic Brownian force acting on the beads of the\nmechanical model [28] was also neglected in order to enable direct deterministic\ncomparison of pathlines obtained with different particle correctors. Considering motion\nof the investigated Brownian particles in fluid at room temperature, stochastic forces are\n6 orders of magnitude smaller compared to viscous drag forces. Under these\nassumptions the equations determining the motion of the beads without constraint\nforces reduce to\n[19]\nThe corresponding length constraints are given by\n[20]\nThe density of the beads, bond lengths and bead radii were obtained from the\nexperimental data published by Tothova et al. [37], which yields the following bead\nparameters normalised by the fluid density \uf072 at room temperature and the cavity\ndepth of mL \uf06d0.1\uf03d\n[21]\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029iiiii bdt\nd\nm urv\nr \uf02d\uf03d \uf070\uf06862\n2\n3..1\uf03di\n.1,1 \uf02b\uf02b \uf03d\uf02d iiii drr\n,1022.1 831\n\uf02d\n\uf02d \uf0d7\uf03d\uf072 ,109.3 331 \uf02d\uf02d \uf0d7\uf03db 32312 103.8 \uf02d\uf0d7\uf03d\uf03d dd\n15\nThe flow was computed on a uniform orthogonal grid comprising 6464\uf0b4 computational\ncells. The force acting on the ssDNA beads was obtained based on the\nvolume-averaged flow velocity in the corresponding flow cell. No-slip boundary\nconditions were imposed on the cavity walls. The computations were performed with\n05.0\uf03d\uf044t and 01.0\uf03d\uf044t .\nInitial simulations were performed using the small time step 01.0\uf03d\uf044t for 10000 time\nsteps. Figure 5 shows particle positions obtained with the FALCO algorithm. Positions\nare displayed with 2.0\uf03dt\uf064 sampling frequency, up to the time step 1200 . Figure 6\nshows the average difference between the bead positions obtained with both algorithms\ndefined as:\n[22]\nHere, the data is shown prior to the first collision with the solid wall. After the collision,\nthe ssDNA starts to spin and the average deviation increases. This can be expected\nsince the update of the bond directions in the correction process of the FALCO algorithm\nresults in better resolution of the rotational motion. However, prior to the wall collision\nand the fast spinning of the particle initiates, the difference between the results obtained\nwith SHAKE and FALCO algorithms was negligible.\nWhen increasing the time step to 05.0\uf03d\uf044t , the simulation using the SHAKE algorithm\ndiverged after 145 steps, whereas the simulation using the FALCO algorithm\nsuccessfully converged. The results clearly demonstrate that the time step magnitude\nhas an impact on the stability of the SHAKE algorithm. An explanation can be proposed\n.\n3\n1 3\n1\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf03d\ni\ni\nFALCO\ni\nSHAKED rr\n16\nbased on the fact that the SHAKE algorithm utilises previous time step bond directions,\nwhich leads to high sensitivity to the angular displacement of the bonds. The\ncombination of angular deflections and large deviations from the prescribed bond length\nleads to the divergence of the particle corrector. The validity of this hypothesis can be\ndemonstrated by analysing the evolution of the initial guess for the particle corrector.\nThe quality of the initial guess can be quantified using the average deviation of the\nunconstrained bond length from the prescribed bond length given by\n[23]\nand the average angular displacement given by\n[24]\nwhere 12\uf061 and 23\uf061 denote the angles between the bond orientation at time level t\nand tt \uf044\uf02b for bonds 12 and 23 respectively.\nFigures 7 and 8 show the evolution of d\uf044 and \uf061\uf044 for the simulation conducted with\nthe SHAKE algorithm using time step 05.0\uf03d\uf044t . As the simulation progresses, the initial\nguess gets worse for both measures. Both measures increase when the SHAKE\nsimulation diverges with the average angular deviation equal to 083.2 and the average\nbond length deviation equal to %99.0 . However, whereas for the average angular\ndeviation the divergence point corresponds to a maximum, the same is not true for the\naverage bond length deviation.\n\uf028 \uf029ddddd uncunc \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf044 23122\n1\n\uf028 \uf029,\n2\n1\n2312 \uf061\uf061\uf061 \uf02b\uf03d\uf044\n17\nFigures 9 and 10 show the evolution of d\uf044 and \uf061\uf044 measures for the simulation\nconducted with the FALCO algorithm and the same time step 05.0\uf03d\uf044t . As can be seen\nfrom Figure 9, d\uf044 reaches the value of %22.1 which is higher than the value of d\uf044\nat the divergence point of the SHAKE algorithm. Furthermore, during the simulation\nconducted with the FALCO algorithm, the angular displacement \uf061\uf044 reaches the value\nof 03.16 at time step134 , which exceeds significantly the critical value observed at the\ndivergence point of the SHAKE algorithm.\nThe results indicate that it is possible to obtain a converged solution with the FALCO\nalgorithm even when the initial guess is much worse ( 03.16\uf03d\uf044 FALCO\uf061 ) than that leading\nto the breakdown of the SHAKE algorithm ( 083.2\uf03d\uf044 SHAKE\uf061 ).\n5 Conclusions\nA new particle corrector algorithm has been proposed based on purely geometric\nconsiderations. The final update formula of the proposed FALCO algorithm can be\nrelated to the SHAKE particle corrector of Ryckaert et al. [29] by an appropriate choice of\nLagrangian multipliers. Although both SHAKE and FALCO algorithms are based on the\nmethod of constraint forces, numerical implementation of force approximations reveals\nsignificant differences. Contrary to SHAKE algorithm, the developed FALCO corrector\napproximates the constraint forces a-priori. This approach reduces the computational\nrequirements and enhances overall stability of the new algorithm. The other beneficial\nfeature of the proposed algorithm is the iterative update of the bond directions, which\nreduces sensitivity of the FALCO algorithm to angular displacements.\n18\nThe FALCO algorithm has been validated using the analytic solution for the rotating\ndumbbell problem. Further numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed FALCO\nalgorithm is more robust and capable of obtaining converged solution with relatively\npoor initial guess, which ultimately allows utilisation of larger time steps.\n6 Acknowledgments\nThis work has been supported in part by the European Commission under the 6th\nFramework Program (Project: DINAMICS, NMP4-CT-2007-026804).\n19\n7 References\n[1] Freemantle M.
