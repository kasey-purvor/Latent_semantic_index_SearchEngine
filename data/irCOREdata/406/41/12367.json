The existing literature reported that learning to write disciplinary\\ud\nassignments is an interactional and dynamic process, encompassing not only writing and\\ud\nreading but also social interactions occurring among novice and more experienced\\ud\nmembers of the discourse community. Nevertheless, previous studies suggested that HE\\ud\ninstitutions still tend to hold narrow views on academic writing and to provide little\\ud\nattention to its teaching. Essentially, many studies are limited because they have\\ud\nexamined how isolated factors (i.e. tutor written feedback or use of guidelines) impacted\\ud\non student writing, overlooking the complexity of interactions that can come into play\\ud\nand influence student writing.\\ud\nThis research adopted a longitudinal case study to investigate in-depth the writing\\ud\nexperiences of five EAL students. To conduct this exploratory project, I employed\\ud\nconstructivist and interpretivist approaches and multiple methods such as selfcompletion\\ud\nquestionnaire, semi-structured interviews and analysis of tutors\u2018 feedback\\ud\nsheets and handbooks.\\ud\nThis project suggests that indeed learning to write in HE was an active and dynamic\\ud\nprocess, encompassing interactions with members of the discourse community (tutors,\\ud\npeers and teacher-assistants), with the training system (taught module courses, writing\\ud\nassignments, academic writing class, CELTE support) and with institutional artefacts\\ud\n(samples of previously written work, published guidelines and assessment criteria).\\ud\nDespite a number of literacy practices designed to make the departmental conventions\\ud\nand expectations transparent, there was a level of invisibility of the conventions students\\ud\nwere expected to adopt in their writing.

The existing literature reported that learning to write disciplinary\\ud\nassignments is an interactional and dynamic process, encompassing not only writing and\\ud\nreading but also social interactions occurring among novice and more experienced\\ud\nmembers of the discourse community. Nevertheless, previous studies suggested that HE\\ud\ninstitutions still tend to hold narrow views on academic writing and to provide little\\ud\nattention to its teaching.
