Initial searches were\ncarried out in November 2007, with electronic database\nsearches repeated in March 2010.\nStudy selection Eligible studies were randomised,\nplacebo controlled trials of calcium supplements\n(\u2265500 mg\/day), with 100 or more participants of mean\nagemore than 40 years and study durationmore than one\nyear. The lead authors of eligible trials supplied data.\nCardiovascular outcomeswere obtained fromself reports,\nhospital admissions, and death certificates.\nResults 15 trials were eligible for inclusion, five with\npatient level data (8151 participants, median follow-up\n3.6 years, interquartile range 2.7-4.3 years) and 11 with\ntrial level data (11921 participants, mean duration\n4.0 years). In the five studies contributing patient level\ndata, 143 people allocated to calcium had a myocardial\ninfarction compared with 111 allocated to placebo\n(hazard ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.67,\nP=0.035). Non-significant increases occurred in the\nincidence of stroke (1.20, 0.96 to 1.50, P=0.11), the\ncomposite end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or\nsudden death (1.18, 1.00 to 1.39, P=0.057), and death\n(1.09, 0.96 to 1.23, P=0.18). The meta-analysis of trial\nlevel data showed similar results: 296 people had a\nmyocardial infarction (166 allocated to calcium, 130 to\nplacebo), with an increased incidence of myocardial\ninfarction in those allocated to calcium (pooled relative\nrisk 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.59,\nP=0.038).\nConclusions Calcium supplements (without\ncoadministered vitamin D) are associated with an\nincreased risk of myocardial infarction. As calcium\nsupplements are widely used these modest increases in\nrisk of cardiovascular disease might translate into a large\nburden of disease in the population. A reassessment of\nthe role of calcium supplements in the management of\nosteoporosis is warranted.\nINTRODUCTION\nOsteoporosis is a major cause of morbidity and mor-\ntality in older people.1 Calcium supplements margin-\nally reduce the risk of fracture,23 and most guidelines\nrecommend adequate calcium intake as an integral\npart of the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.4 5\nConsequently, calcium supplements are commonly\nused by people over the age of 50. Observational stu-\ndies suggest that high calcium intake might protect\nagainst vascular disease,6-8 and the findings are consis-\ntent with those of interventional studies of calcium sup-\nplements that show improvement in somevascular risk\nfactors.9-11 In contrast, calcium supplements accelerate\nvascular calcification and increasemortality in patients\nwith renal failure, in both dialysis and predialysis\npopulations.12-14 Furthermore, a five year randomised\ncontrolled trial of calcium supplements in healthy\nolder women, in which cardiovascular events were\nprespecified as secondary end points, recently\nreported possible increases in rates of myocardial\ninfarction and cardiovascular events in women allo-\ncated to calcium.15 16 We carried out a meta-analysis\nof cardiovascular events in randomised trials of cal-\ncium supplements.\nMETHODS\nInNovember 2007we searchedMedline, Embase, and\nthe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for\nrandomised placebo controlled trials of calcium sup-\nplements, using the terms \u201ccalcium\u201d, \u201crandomised\ncontrolled trial\u201d, and \u201cplacebo\u201d as text words, and cor-\nrespondingMeSH terms (full details are available from\nthe authors). We searched for studies in the reference\nlists of meta-analyses published between 1990 and\n2007 of the effect of calcium supplements on bone den-\nsity, fracture, colorectal neoplasia, and blood pressure,\nand in two clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov\nand Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry).\nNo language restrictions were applied. In March 2010\nwe updated the searches of the electronic databases\n(Medline: January 1966-March 2010, Embase: Janu-\nary 1980-March 2010, Central Register of Controlled\nTrials: first quarter 2010).\n1Department of Medicine, Faculty\nof Medical and Health Sciences,\nUniversity of Auckland, Private Bag\n92 019, Auckland 1142, New\nZealand\n2Health Services Research Unit,\nUniversity of Aberdeen\n3Department of Medicine, and\nDepartment of Community and\nFamily Medicine, Dartmouth\nMedical School, NH, USA\nCorrespondence to: I R Reid\ni.reid@auckland.ac.nz\nCite this as: BMJ 2010;341:c3691\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.c3691\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 9\nStudy selection\nWe included studies if they were randomised, double\nblind, placebo controlled trials; elemental calciumwas\nadministered at a dose of \u2265500 mg\/day; the partici-\npants\u2019 mean age at baseline was more than 40 years;\n100 or more participants were randomised; partici-\npants of either sex were studied; and the trial duration\nwas more than one year.\nWe excluded trials concerning calcium and vitamin\nD given together with a placebo comparator (trials\nwere only eligible if vitamin D was given to both inter-\nvention and control groups, because vitaminD supple-\nmentation has been associated with decreased\nmortality17); trials in which calcium was administered\nin the form of dietary modification or a complex nutri-\ntional supplement; and trials in which most partici-\npants had a major systemic disease other than\nosteoporosis.\nSearch results\nOne investigator (MB) carriedout the initial search and\ntwo investigators (AG and MB) independently\nreviewed all potentially relevant studies. Overall, 190\npotentially relevant reports of studies were identified\nfrom the initial searches, but only 15 studies were eli-\ngible for analysis.15 16 18-33 Thirteen studies compared\ncalcium supplements with placebo,15 16 18-27 29 31-33 one\nstudy had a 2\u00d72 factorial design allowing comparison\nof calcium with placebo and calcium plus vitamin D\nwith vitamin D,28 and one study compared calcium\nplus alendronate with alendronate.30\nData description\nWe invited the lead author of each eligible study to\nprovide patient level data on cardiovascular events\nthat occurred during the study irrespective of whether\nthe participant was still taking the trial drug. When\nsuch data were not available we requested summary\ndata at trial level. We obtained patient level data on\ncardiovascular outcomes for five studies, and partially\ncomplete trial level data for six. No data were available\nfor four studies because the original records were no\nlonger available and cardiovascular events were not\npreviously reported,18 20 or no cardiovascular data\nwere available.23 26 Thus, patient level data on cardio-\nvascular outcomes were available for 63% of partici-\npants in the 15 eligible studies, complete trial level\ndata for 85% of participants, and at least partially com-\nplete trial level data for 93% of participants. Basic\ndemographic and other trial related data were either\nsupplied by the lead authors (or nominated deputies)\nor extracted from the original publication by an inves-\ntigator (MB).\nAscertainment of cardiovascular events\nWe considered a myocardial infarction to have\noccurred when either of the terms \u201cmyocardial infarc-\ntion\u201d or \u201cheart attack\u201d, or code 410 (international clas-\nsification of diseases, ninth revision), was used to\ndescribe the event. A stroke was considered to have\noccurred when any of the terms \u201cstroke\u201d, \u201ccerebral\ninfarction\u201d, \u201cintracerebral hemorrhage\u201d, \u201csubarach-\nnoid hemorrhage\u201d, or \u201ccerebrovascular accident\u201d, or\nany of the ICD-9 codes 430, 431, 433, 434 were used\nto describe the event.We considered a sudden death to\nhave occurred when the term \u201csudden death\u201d or the\nICD-9 code 798 was used to describe the event.\nFive studies contributed patient level data on cardio-\nvascular events. For one study,21 22 self reports of unad-\njudicated events were supplied. Another study28\nsupplied self reports of hospital admissions and cause\nof death from death certificates. Each event was then\nindependently adjudicated by two physicians blinded\nto the treatment allocation of the participants (MB,\nAG), and any disagreements were resolved by consen-\nsus. For another study,25 verified events from hospital\ndischarge data were supplied along with causes of\ndeaths from death certificates. The causes of death\nwere again independently adjudicated. For two\nstudies,15 33 data from self reports, hospital admissions,\nand death certificates were independently adjudicated\nby a cardiologist or neurologist, as previously\ndescribed.16 For six studies contributing trial level\ndata, all data on cardiovascular events were supplied\nby the lead authors and were obtained from physician\nreported cause of death in one study27 and a combina-\ntion of self reports and hospital discharge data in five\nstudies.19 24 29-32\nEnd points\nThe prespecified primary end points were time to first\nmyocardial infarction, time to first stroke, and time to\nfirst event for the composite end point of myocardial\ninfarction, stroke, or sudden death. The secondary end\npoint was time to death (all cause mortality).\nStatistical analysis\nIn trials with patient level data, we analysed each end\npoint using a Cox proportional hazards model, with a\ndummy coded variable representing each study in the\nmodel, and we reported the hazard ratio, with 95%\nconfidence interval, and number needed to treat. The\nassumption of proportional hazards was explored by\nReports of studies identified by initial search (n=11 363)\nReports of potentially relevant studies\nidentified and screened for retrieval (n=190)\n28 reports of 15 studies eligible for inclusion\nReports of studies excluded (n=162):\n  Study size (n=111)\n  Duration \u226412 months (n=30)\n  Study design (n=21)\nFig 1 | Flowchart of studies. Initial search was in November\n2007: 9358 reports were identified, 173 reports of potentially\nrelevant studies retrieved, 150 reports excluded, and 23\nreports of 15 individual studies identified.

For a small number of events (<10%) the\ntimingwas unknown.We treated these events as if they\nhad occurred on the last day of follow-up for that par-\nticipant. Possible confounding by covariates was\nassessed by repeating thesemodels including prespeci-\nfied covariates likely to be associated with cardio-\nvascular outcomes (age, sex, smoking status, presence\nof diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension at base-\nline, and history of coronary heart disease) where data\nwere available for more than 80% of participants. Pre-\nspecified subgroup analyses for dietary calcium, age,\nsex, vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D\n\u226550 nmol\/l or <50 nmol\/l), and supplement type\nwere done using interaction terms between treatment\nallocation and the factor of interest.\nWe used Poisson regression models to assess the\nrelation between the total number of events and treat-\nment allocation. Because recurrent cardiovascular\nevents in an individual are unlikely to be independent,\nwe used Poisson regression with general estimating\nequations to account for the intra-individual depen-\ndence of events.\nTo assess statistical heterogeneity between summary\ndata at trial level we used Cochran\u2019s Q statistic\n(P<0.10) and the I2 statistic (I2>50%). No significant\nstatistical heterogeneity existed between trials in any\nof the analyses. We used random effects models to\npool summary data at trial level. Publication bias was\nassessed using Funnel plots and Egger\u2019s regression\nmodel.34 Analyses were done using SAS version 9.1\nor Comprehensive Meta-analysis version 2 (Biostat,\nEnglewood, NJ). All tests were two tailed and we con-\nsidered P<0.05 as significant.\nRESULTS\nFigure 1 shows the results of the literature search and\ntable 1 the characteristics of the eligible studies. The\nquality of the five studies contributing patient level\ndata has been independently assessed in previous sys-\ntematic reviews.3 35 36\nAll 11 eligible trials were double blind, randomised\nstudies. Themethodof randomisationwas stated expli-\ncitly in seven: one used a central randomisation service\nand six used computer generated random numbers.\nAllocation concealment was explicitly described in\nfour studies. Ten studies gave details of participants\nwho withdrew or were lost to follow-up. Compliance\nwas reported in all 11 studies, but the definitions for\ncompliance differed between studies and were not\nalways comparable. In general, studies reported com-\npliance ofmore than 75% in participants whowere tak-\ning tablets at study completion.

The median (interquartile range) duration\nof follow-up in both groups was 3.6 (2.7-4.3) years.\nIn total, 143 people allocated to calcium had a myo-\ncardial infarction during follow-up compared with 111\nallocated to placebo. The risk of incident myocardial\ninfarction in those allocated to calcium increased by\n31% (hazard ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.02\nto 1.67, P=0.035. fig 2). During follow-up, 167 people\nallocated to calcium and 143 allocated to placebohad a\nstroke (1.20, 0.96 to 1.50, P=0.11), 293 people allo-\ncated to calcium and 254 allocated to placebo had\nany of myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden death\n(1.18, 1.00 to 1.39, P=0.057), and 519 people allocated\nto calcium and 487 allocated to placebo died (1.09,\n0.96 to 1.23, P=0.18). The number needed to treat\n(NNT)with calcium for five years to cause one incident\nevent was 69 for myocardial infarction, 100 for stroke,\n61 for any of myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden\ndeath, and 77 for death.Adjusting for prespecified cov-\nariates related to cardiovascular outcomes with data\navailable for more than 80% of participants (age, sex,\nsmoking status, anddiabetes) did not change the results\nof the primary analyses.\nPrespecified subgroup analyses showed a significant\ninteraction between treatment allocation and dietary\ncalcium intake for myocardial infarction. Calcium\ntreatmentwas associatedwith an increased risk ofmyo-\ncardial infarction in people with dietary calcium intake\nabove the median of 805 mg\/day (hazard ratio 1.85,\n95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.67) but no increased\nrisk in those with dietary calcium intake below the\nmedian (0.98, 0.69 to 1.38, P for interaction 0.01).\nWhen the cohort was divided by fifths of dietary cal-\ncium intake rounded to the nearest 100 mg\/day, the\nrespective hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals)\nfor the effect of calcium treatment on myocardial\ninfarction were 1.18 (0.70 to 2.00) for <500 mg\/day,\n0.68 (0.39 to 1.18) for 500-699 mg\/day, 2.28 (1.26 to\n4.15) for 700-899 mg\/day, 1.81 (0.97 to 3.41) for 900-\n1099 mg\/day, and 1.41 (0.81 to 2.48) for \u22651100 mg\/\nday; test for linear trend when hazard ratios are\nexpressed relative to the <500 mg\/d fifth, P=0.12.\nInteractions between treatment allocation and age,\nsex, vitamin D status, or supplement type for myo-\ncardial infarction were not significant, nor were they\nbetween treatment allocation and any of these vari-\nables or dietary calcium intake for stroke, the compo-\nsite end point, or death.\nRecurrent cardiovascular events tended to be more\ncommon in people allocated to calcium. Comparing\npeople allocated to calciumwith those allocated to pla-\ncebo, 19 versus 13 had more than one myocardial\ninfarction (P=0.38), 21 versus 13 had more than one\nstroke (P=0.23), and 59 versus 32 had more than one\nof myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden death\n(P=0.006). Poisson regressionmodels with general esti-\nmating equations were used to estimate the effect of\ncalcium on the total number of events, including inci-\ndent and recurrent events. Overall, 164 myocardial\ninfarctions occurred in people allocated to calcium\ncompared with 125 in those allocated to placebo (rela-\ntive risk 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.71,\nP=0.032). Stroke occurred in 190 people allocated to\ncalcium compared with 156 allocated to placebo (1.24,\n0.99 to 1.56, P=0.07). In total, 361 myocardial infarc-\ntions, strokes, or sudden deaths occurred in people\nallocated to calcium comparedwith 287 in people allo-\ncated to calcium (1.27, 1.07 to 1.51, P=0.006).\nTrial level analysis\nTable 3 shows summary data on cardiovascular events\nat trial level.

Figure 3 shows the results of the main\nanalysis. Allocation to calcium supplements was asso-\nciated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction\n(relative risk 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to\n1.59, P=0.038) but not stroke, the composite end\npoint, or death. Including data from the three addi-\ntional studies in the sensitivity analysis did not signifi-\ncantly change the results for any end point.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this pooled analysis of around 12 000 participants\nfrom 11 randomised controlled trials, calcium supple-\nments were associatedwith about a 30% increase in the\nincidence of myocardial infarction and smaller, non-\nsignificant, increases in the risk of stroke andmortality.\nWhen recurrent events in 10-17% of participants were\nincluded in analyses, the results were similar, although\nthe relative risks tended to be slightly larger. The find-\nings were consistent across trials, with an increased\nrelative risk of myocardial infarction with calcium\nobserved in six of the seven trials in which at least\none event occurred, although no individual trial\nreported a statistically significant effect. The risk of\nmyocardial infarction with calcium tended to be\ngreater in those with dietary calcium intake above the\nmedian but was independent of age, sex, and type of\nsupplement.\nLimitations of the review\nOur study has some limitations. We excluded studies\nthat compared coadministered calcium and vitamin D\nsupplements with placebo. The results therefore may\nnot apply to coadministered calcium and vitamin D\nsupplements.Noneof the trials had cardiovascular out-\ncomes as the primary end points, and data on cardio-\nvascular events were not gathered in a standardised\nmanner. In only two of the trials were the data adjudi-\ncated by blinded trial investigators. However, unless\nthere was differential misclassification or misreporting\nof cardiovascular events in people treated with cal-\ncium, this is unlikely to alter the results, because the\ndata came from blinded, placebo controlled trials.\nIncomplete or no data on cardiovascular outcomes\nwere available for seven trials in our analysis, compris-\ning about 15% of the total number of participants.\nHowever, the small size of these trials and the consis-\ntency of the findings in the other eight larger trials sug-\ngest the missing data are unlikely to have substantially\nchanged the results.\nComparison with other studies\nThe current findings are consistent with trials of\npatients with renal failure, in which calcium supple-\nments were associated with an increase in mortality.13\nFew comparable data are available from observational\nstudies of calcium supplements. One study reported a\n24% increase in coronary heart disease in Finnish post-\nmenopausal women using calcium supplements (with\nor without vitamin D) compared with non-users.37\nNon-fatal myocardial infarction in US men using cal-\ncium supplements compared with non-users did not\nincrease significantly, although the relative risk for\neach fifth of supplement intake ranged between 1.02\nand 1.07.38\nThe relations between dietary calcium intake and\ncardiovascular events have also been examined.

These differ-\nences suggest that cardiovascular risks from high cal-\ncium intake might be restricted to use of calcium\nsupplements.\nA body of evidence related to the current work\ncomes from studies comparing coadministered cal-\ncium and vitamin D supplements with placebo,\nwhich were excluded from our meta-analysis.\nRecently, the Women\u2019s Health Initiative reported\nthat calcium and vitamin D had no effect on the risk\nof coronary heart disease or stroke.41 The findings of\nthat study might differ from ours for several reasons.\nTheWomen\u2019s Health Initiative used low dose vitamin\nD supplements, and vitamin D deficiency has been\nassociated with increased risk of cardiovascular\ndisease42 and vitamin D supplementation with\ndecreased mortality.17 Also, the participants differed\nfrom those in our meta-analysis: on average they\nwere younger (mean age 62 v 75 years), heavier\n(mean weight 76 v 68 kg; 34% in Women\u2019s Health\nInitiative v 10% of women in our meta-analysis\nweighed >80 kg), had higher calcium intakes (mean\n1150 v 830 mg\/day), and a higher proportion were\nusing hormone replacement therapy (52% v <3% in\nour meta-analysis).

In patients with renal\nfailure (both dialysis and predialysis populations) cal-\ncium supplements accelerate vascular calcification and\nincrease mortality.12-14 Our graphical data are consis-\ntent with the possibility that an increased risk of myo-\ncardial infarction with calcium supplements emerges\nquickly, pointing tomechanisms such as increased coa-\ngulability or altered vascular flow, perhaps mediated\ndirectly through the calcium sensing receptor or indir-\nectly through alterations in calcitropic hormones.\n  Baron 1999\n  Grant 2005\n  Grant 2005 Vit D\n  Prince 2006\n  Reid 2006\n  Lappe 2007\n  Reid 2008\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity:\n  I2=0% P=0.96\n13\n29\n26\n13\n17\n1\n1\nStudy Relative risk of myocardial\ninfarction (95% CI)\nWeight\n(%)\n  Baron 1999\n  Grant 2005\n  Grant 2005 Vit D\n  Prince 2006\n  Reid 2006\n  Bonnick 2007\n  Reid 2008\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity:\n  I2=0% P=0.84\n4\n43\n42\n5\n5\n0.2\n0.2\n0.5 1.20.8 1 1.5 2 3\nStudy\nFavours\ncalcium\nFavours\nplacebo\nRelative risk of\ndeath (95% CI)\nWeight\n(%)\nWeight\n(%)\n  Reid 1993\n  Baron 1999\n  Grant 2005\n  Grant 2005 Vit D\n  Prince 2006\n  Reid 2006\n  Bonnick 2007\n  Lappe 2007\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity:\n  I2=0% P=0.93\n1\n6\n26\n30\n20\n14\n1\n2\nStudy Relative risk of\nstroke (95% CI)\nFavours\ncalcium\nFavours\nplacebo\n0.5 1.20.8 1 1.5 2 3\nWeight\n(%)\n  Reid 1993\n  Baron 1999\n  Grant 2005\n  Grant 2005 Vit D\n  Prince 2006\n  Reid 2006\n  Lappe 2007\n  Reid 2008\nTotal\nTest for heterogeneity:\n  I2=0% P=0.91\n0.4\n9\n27\n28\n17\n16\n2\n0.2\n1.27 (1.01 to 1.59)\n1.12 (0.97 to 1.30)\n1.12 (0.92 to 1.36)\n1.07 (0.95 to 1.19)\nP=0.038\nP=0.13\nP=0.25\nP=0.26\nStudy Relative risk of myocardial infarction,\nstroke, or sudden death (95% CI)\nFig 3 | Random effects models of effect of calcium supplementation on cardiovascular events and death.

The vascular effects of calcium supple-\nments, especially without vitaminD, should be studied\nfurther. Although the magnitude of the increase in risk\nis modest, the widespread use of calcium supplements\nmeans that even a small increase in incidence of cardio-\nvascular disease could translate into a large burden of\ndisease in the population. The likely adverse effect of\ncalcium supplements on cardiovascular events, taken\ntogether with the possible adverse effect on incidence\nof hip fracture258 and its modest overall efficacy in\nreducing fracture (about 10% reduction in total\nfractures)2 3 suggest that a reassessment of the role of\ncalcium supplements in the prevention and treatment\nof osteoporosis is warranted.\nWe thank the investigators who provided unpublished data on\ncardiovascular events from their studies including Larry Riggs, Richard\nPrince, Claire Bonithon-Kopp, Joan Lappe, Boyd Scott, and Kathy Zhu, as\nwell as Adrian M Grant, M K Campbell, Alison M McDonald and Gladys C\nMcPherson from the Randomised Evaluation of Calcium or Vitamin D trial.\nContributors:MJB, AG, and IRR drafted the protocol.
