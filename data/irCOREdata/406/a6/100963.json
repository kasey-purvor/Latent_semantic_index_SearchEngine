This prevents the realization of an\nentangled two photon source based on individual QD\u2019s.11,12\nA splitting smaller than the radiative broadening [of order of\na few meV (Ref. 13)] is required for photon entanglement11\nin such sources of potential importance for implementation\nin quantum information systems.14\nThe fine structure splitting arises due to the long range\nelectron-hole exchange interaction, and occurs in systems\nwith lowered in-plane symmetry.4,8,15 Due to the reduced ato-\nmistic symmetry of zinc blende semiconductors (C2v sym-\nmetry), fine structure splitting is expected for self-assembled\ndots with cylindrical symmetry about the growth axis, al-\nthough in this case splittings of only up to <9 meV are\npredicted,8 considerably smaller than those found in most\nas-grown dot samples (see below). The splitting will then be\nenhanced by anisotropy in dot shape occurring during crystal\ngrowth. In a similar way it is known that the strain field is\nanisotropic for self-assembled dots, distinguishing the [110]\nand f\u2212110g directions, even for dots of spherical shape.16,17\nThe strain leads to piezoelectric fields in the samples, and\nwhen included in k \u00b7p theory treatments of electronic band\nstructure, leads to markedly enhanced p-state splittings;17 the\ns-like ground state is expected to show similarly enhanced\nsplitting when strain and piezoelectric fields are enhanced. In\naccord with the above arguments, in unstrained dots in a\nglass matrix, the fine structure is zero.18 Further support to\nthe above reasoning is given by recent experiments where\nexternally applied uniaxial strain was shown to produce a\nlarge splitting of bright excitons in quantum wells.19\nHere we present systematic studies of the fine structure\nsplitting in ensembles of InGaAs dots, providing experimen-\ntal evidence for the factors determining the magnitude of the\nelectron-hole exchange interaction. In particular, we show\nthat EFS can be accurately tuned in InGaAs dots by post-\ngrowth thermal annealing (enhancing the In\/Ga intermixing\nand reducing strain20) and also reduced considerably in\nDWELL laser structures where the In-rich dots dots are sur-\nrounded by two strain-reducing InGaAs layers.21,22 The no-\ntable In\/Ga intermixing occurring during thermal annealing\nis shown to result in a smaller EFS. These observations sug-\ngest that strain present in dots due to the lattice mismatch of\nIn(Ga)As and GaAs plays an important role in controlling\nthe fine structure splitting. On the other hand, by comparing\ndifferent QD\u2019s grown on GaAs and DWELL structures we\nfind that the depth of the exciton confinement is a less sig-\nnificant factor in determining EFS.\nWe deduce EFS from low T measurements of the period of\nquantum beats in polarization-resolved pump-probe experi-\nments on dot ensembles. In the experiments a circularly po-\nlarized pump pulse excites the two linearly polarized exciton\nmodes (split by the electron-hole exchange interaction) with\nthe initial relative phase DQ0=p \/2.

This in turn leads to a periodic variation of the coher-\nent polarization in the sample, which is then probed by a\nsecond circularly polarized probe pulse.9,10 The oscillations\nof the coherent polarization in a large ensemble of dots are\ndamped due to the slight dot-to-dot variation of EFS (which\nwe describe in the model below by a Gaussian of width d). In\naddition, the coherence of the exciton states Tcoh can be fur-\nther reduced due to scattering processes with, e.g., phonons\n[insignificant at T,40 K (Ref. 10)].\nBy varying the pump-probe delay the time-dependent dif-\nferential transmission signal DP \/ P can be measured (P laser\npower transmitted through the sample). DP \/ P has contribu-\ntions from (i) the coherent polarization dynamics (respon-\nsible for quantum beats) and (ii) incoherent carrier popula-\ntion decay (leading to a slow exponential decay). We find\nthat even in nominally undoped samples (ii) contains sepa-\nrate contributions from neutral and charged dots,10 which we\nintroduce into the model via time constants tX and tchX, re-\nspectively. On the other hand, a charged exciton (in its\nground state) does not contribute to (i) due to the suppression\nof the electron-hole exchange interaction.4,6,7 We can now\nwrite23\nIs+s\u00b1 = e\u2212t\/tX \u00b1 e\u2212t\/Tcohe\u2212d\n2t2 cossvtd + s1 \u00b1 1d\nAch\n4\ne\u2212t\/tchX,\ns1d\nwhere Is+s\u00b1 describes the DP \/ P signal for pumping with a\ns+-polarized pulse and probing with a s\u00b1-polarized probe.\nv=EFS\/\" and Ach is the weight of the charged dots in the dot\nensemble.26 In what follows, we will focus on the deduction\nof v from our experimental data, which we show can be\nachieved with accuracy better than \u00b110%.\nWe studied dots grown on GaAs with low T photolumi-\nnescence (PL) of \u201cas grown\u201d QD\u2019s in the range\n980\u20131035 nm. The first type of samples (A) comprises 16\nQD layers grown at T=500 \u00b0C using molecular beam epi-\ntaxy (MBE). The dot density is <631010 cm\u22122. In the\nsamples of type A with nominally InAs dots (considered in\ndetail below) each dot layer (2.2 ML thick) is grown in the\nmiddle of a 20 nm GaAs quantum well clad by 10 nm thick\nAlGaAs barriers. Different sections of the wafer were ther-\nmally annealed at 700 \u00b0C for up to tan=17.5 min. In addi-\ntion, we studied 7 ML thick In0.5Ga0.5As dots (low T emis-\nsion at 1035 nm) embedded in Al-free GaAs barriers (type\nB), and samples of type C, DWELL laser structures grown\nby MBE. The DWELL structures contain three layers of\nnominally InAs dots grown between two In0.15Ga0.85As\nstrain-reducing layers (2 nm below and 6 nm above the dots)\nwith the low T PL peak at <1200 nm. The dot density is\n3.631010 cm\u22122.\nDifferential transmission signals were measured using\nlock-in techniques.10 The radiation was supplied by a femto-\nsecond Ti-sapphire laser and a synchronously pumped opti-\ncal parametric oscillator (OPO) with repetition rate 76 MHz\nand emission FWHM of <10 meV (approximately 200 fs\npulse duration). The excitation pulses were tuned into reso-\nnance with the peak of the QD exciton ground state. The\nresults reported are obtained in the low density limit of ,0.1\nexcitons per dot.\nThe inset in Fig. 2(a) shows the results of the PL charac-\nterization (at T=7 K) of annealed samples of type A. The PL\nspectrum measured for the \u201cas grown\u201d sample exhibits a\npeak at 980 nm with a FWHM of 77 nm s<100 meVd. After\nannealing for 2.5 min at 700 \u00b0C the PL peak shifts to\n967 nm and the width reduces by 10%. As the annealing\ntime is further increased, the PL peak shifts to shorter wave-\nlength and reaches 942 nm (FWHM 63 meV) for the sample\nannealed for 17.5 min. The observed behavior arises due to\nIn\/Ga intermixing,24,25 which leads to a more Ga rich dot\ncomposition and hence weaker confinement potential.\nFigure 2 shows DP \/ P pump-probe traces measured at T\n=7 K for the annealed samples with co- and cross-circularly\npolarized pulses. The dynamics measured for the as grown\nsample and samples annealed for tan=7.5 and 17.5 min are\nshown in Figs. 2(a)\u20132(c) respectively. In the s+s+ configu-\nration the DP \/ P signal is maximum at zero delay between\nthe pump and probe pulses. The signal exhibits a fast oscil-\nlation and then decays with a time constant of few hundred\nps at delay times td.200 ps [see the inset of Fig. 2(b) for\nFIG. 2.

The behavior in\nthe case of the s+s\u2212 configuration is in antiphase to that of\nthe s+s+ traces at td,200 ps, with a negligible signal at\ntd<0.9,10\nAs seen from Fig. 2 a systematic variation of the exciton\ndynamics is observed in the pump-probe curves measured\nfrom samples annealed for different times: As indicated by\nthe vertical arrows, the oscillations in both s+s+ and s+s\u2212\nconfigurations occur on a progressively longer time scale as\nthe annealing time is increased. The increase of the oscilla-\ntion period corresponds to a reduction in EFS. The oscillation\nperiod tosc (and hence EFS=h \/ tosc) is deduced from fitting of\nthe DP \/ P traces using Eq. (1). The dependences of tosc and\nEFS on tan are plotted in Fig. 3(a). After annealing for\n17.5 min tosc reaches <260 ps, corresponding to EFS\n<15 meV.\nWe find that for the unannealed sample a satisfactory fit of\nthe DP \/ P curves is only possible if the contributions of at\nleast two dot distributions to the oscillation behavior are\ntaken into account. This is consistent with the observation of\nmulti-modal structure in the PL spectrum of the dot ensemble\nin the as grown sample (Fig. 2). The annealing results in\nsuppression of the multi-modal dot distribution in the PL\nspectra, which we are able to confirm also on a very fine\nenergy scale in the pump-probe measurements.\nFigure 3(b) compares the results presented in Fig. 3(a)\nwith EFS data measured on two other samples of type B. EFS\nis plotted in Fig. 3(b) versus the PL peak wavelength lPL\nwhich decreases with annealing time for these samples. The\ndata from Fig. 3(a) (for the nominally InAs QD sample of\ntype A) is shown by grey squares, while the results for two\nsamples of type B are shown by open and black symbols,\nrespectively. These samples were annealed for up to 20 min\nat 750\u00b0 (points above 970 nm) and 800 \u00b0C (points below\n950 nm). As seen, EFS can be tuned by annealing over a very\nlarge range from <36 to 8 meV. The almost linear correla-\ntion between lPL and EFS for all three samples is notable,\nhowever, a difference is observed in the dependences\nEFSslPLd for different types of samples. The sample with\nnominally InAs dots has larger EFS in the range of lPL,\nwhere the dependences from the different samples overlap:\nfor lPL<950 nm EFS measured for this sample is up to a\nfactor of 2 higher than for the samples with nominally\nIn0.5Ga0.5As dots.\nOne of the important parameters which has an impact on\nEFS and is modified by the In\/Ga intermixing during anneal-\ning is strain. During the growth of quantum dots the strain\ndue to the lattice mismatch with the underlying GaAs is re-\nlieved partially via the coarsening of the In-rich surface and\neventual formation of dots. However, the consequent capping\nof In-rich dots with GaAs results in additional compressive\nstrain in dots and tensile strain in GaAs.16,17 These strains\nwill be reduced during thermal annealing,25 producing more\nGa-rich dots due to the In\/Ga intermixing and thus reducing\nthe lattice constant contrast in the material surrounding the\ndots. The reduction of strain (with the latter predicted to\ninduce further anisotropy in dots16) will result in more s-like\nexciton wave functions and hence weaker e-h exchange\ninteraction.15\nIn order to further investigate the validity of our sugges-\ntions we have studied a dot-in-a-well structure (sample C),\nwhere the dots are surrounded by material with considerably\nsmaller lattice contrast: InAs dots are grown inside an\nIn0.15Ga0.85As layer. Strain engineering by capping of dots\nwith InGaAs layers is well documented.21 It has been found\nthat covering dots with 4 nm of InxGa1\u2212xAs results in a\nmarked red-shift of the dot emission, with the strain reduc-\ntion in the dots playing a major role in the lowering of the\ntransition energy (to a wavelength of <1.3 mm at T\n=300 K in the dots we study).\nFigure 3(c) shows a PL spectrum for the DWELL struc-\nture investigated, with the arrow indicating the ground state\nspectral position s<1190 nmd where the pump-probe signal\nis measured. In the same way as the data in Fig. 2, the dif-\nferential transmission signal in both polarization configura-\ntions shows oscillations [Fig. 3(d)], evolving relatively\nslowly as compared with \u201cas grown\u201d conventional dot\nsamples [Fig. 2(a)]. Analysis of the results using Eq. (1)\nprovides the data shown in Fig. 3(a) by triangles: tosc\n=238 ps and EFS=16.5 meV. To our knowledge, the data for\nEFS reported here is the first measurement of the fine struc-\nture splitting for DWELL structures.\nThe magnitude of EFS is about 2 times smaller than that\ndetected for unannealed dots grown on GaAs. This deviates\nnotably from the trend in EFSslPLd observed in Fig. 3(b),\nshowing that the magnitude of the exciton fine structure\nsplitting is not directly related to the magnitude of confine-\nFIG. 3.

On the other hand, the small\nmagnitude of EFS in the strain-engineered dot structure sup-\nports the effect of strain reduction on decreasing the size of\nthe electron-hole exchange interaction.27\nIn summary, experimental evidence is found for the effect\nof strain reduction on the magnitude of the fine structure\nsplitting of quantum dot excitons. The splitting is shown to\ndecrease in dots after annealing and also in strain-engineered\ndot-in-a-well structures. During annealing In\/Ga intermixing\nleads to smaller lattice constant contrast in the dot environ-\nment, leading to strain reduction. Similarly, in dot-in-a-well\nstructures strain is reduced since dots are surrounded by\nInGaAs layers with a more similar lattice constant to the\nIn-rich dots. Comparative studies of several In(Ga)As dot\nstructures also indicate that exciton confinement has no di-\nrect effect on the fine structure splitting. Finally, thermal an-\nnealing is shown to be a suitable tool to produce small fine\nstructure splittings required for sources of entangled photons\nbased on individual dots.\nDuring the final stage of the preparation of this paper we\nbecame aware that similar effects of annealing measured us-\ning four-wave-mixing techniques have been reported by an-\nother group.28 However, no detailed discussion as to the ori-\ngin of this observation has been presented.\nThis work has been supported by EPSRC Grant No. GR\/\nS49308 and by the Nanomat Project of the Growth Pro-\ngramme of the European Community Grant No. G5RD-CT-\n2001-00545 and by the Royal Society.\n1 D.
