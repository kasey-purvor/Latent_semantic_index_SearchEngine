AIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY\nIMPLEMENTATION: THE CASE OF AVIATION ENGLISH\nJ. Charles Alderson\nThe language of international aviation communication is English, but numerous\naviation incidents and accidents have involved miscommunication between pilots and\nair traffic controllers, many of whom are not native speakers of the language. In 2004\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) published a set of Language\nProficiency Requirements and a Proficiency Rating Scale, and by 5 March 2008, air\ntraffic controllers and pilots were required by the ICAO to have a certificate attesting\nto their proficiency in the language used for international aeronautical\ncommunication. Although some organizations made efforts to produce tests by the\ndeadline, in the event an implementation period was allowed, with a new deadline of\nMarch 2011. This article describes a number of surveys of tests of aviation English,\nthe implementation of the ICAO requirements, and the rating scales. It concludes that\nmany of the assessment procedures appear not to meet international professional\nstandards for language tests, the implementation of the language assessment policy is\ninadequate, and much more careful and close monitoring is needed of the quality of\nthe tests and assessment procedures required by the policy.\nIntroduction\nThe language of international aviation communication, especially between\npilots and air traffic controllers (ATCs) via radiotelephony, is English. Annex 10 to\nthe Convention on International Civil Aviation, Aeronautical Telecommunications, in\nVolume II, Communications Procedures, and Chapter Five, Aeronautical Mobile\nService (paragraph 5.2.1.1.1), recommends the following:\nIn general, the air-ground radiotelephony communications should be\nconducted in the language normally used by the station on the\nground.\nPending the development and adoption of a more suitable form of\nspeech for universal use in aeronautical radiotelephony\n168\nAIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 169\ncommunications, the English language should be used as such and\nshould be available, on request from any aircraft station unable to\ncomply with 5.2.1.1.1, at all stations on the ground serving\ndesignated airports and routes used by international air services.\nHowever, the English of international aviation is not English for general\npurposes or English for international purposes. Aviation English is a language for\nspecific purposes (see Douglas, 2000), but it is even more restricted than that. Much\nof the English of aviation can be classified as a code that is used in a very restricted\ncontext (see Cabre, Freixa, Lorente, & Tebe, cited in Sarmento, 2005, p. 2), known as\nstandard phraseology. It can be seen, following Ragan (2007, p. 54), as a highly\nrestricted register associated with \u201cdistinctive probabilities of discourse functions and\nchoice of lexis and grammar.\u201d\nWritten communication typically takes place through maintenance and\noperations manuals, produced by the airline manufacturers and airline operators. Both\ntypes of document are safety-critical, but especially the operations manual\u2019s abnormal\nand emergency checklists, which provide information on how to cope with nonnormal\nsituations (Sarmento, 2005). The language used in maintenance documents is also\noften known as \u201cSimplified English\u201d (see Shawcross, 1993).\nRadiotelephony communication takes place between pilots and air traffic\ncontrollers, with standard phraseology at the core, and operational exchanges in plain\nEnglish when phraseology is inadequate; such radiotelephonic communication is used\nalmost exclusively for air\u2013ground communication, to direct, inform, question,\nrequest, and respond, where the air traffic controller directs and controls pilots. The\nfocus of the communication is aircraft takeoff and landing, flight navigation, and so\non, and the channel used is spoken, via radiotelephony.\nAlthough the acoustic quality of radiotelephony is often poor, \u201croutine\nair\u2013ground communications are typically smooth and effortless. Misunderstandings\nare infrequent and, in general, they are easily resolved\u201d (Mell, n.d., p. 1). This is\nlargely because, over the years, standard phraseology has developed as an\ninternationally recognized code. This has been refined in part as a result of the\nanalysis of aviation incidents involving miscommunication, whereby ambiguities and\nconfusions have been reduced to a minimum. This restricted code is used in highly\npredictable circumstances, and normal communications follow a prescribed sequence.\nMell (1992) found that about 50% of conversations with air traffic controllers\nare initiated by pilots and follow a fixed sequence. Mell gave an example that he\nanalyzed as follows:\nParis. Good afternoon. Jetset 762.\nLevel 370.\nOn course Deauville\n170 ALDERSON\nThe controller, who is already in possession of the flight\nplan details of this aircraft, is expecting the call. In addition, the call\nfollows a well-established script for such messages\u2014that is to say, a\ngreeting, followed by the current flight parameters (flight level and\nroute). Each individual message turns up in a predetermined slot at a\npoint in the sequence when the controller is expecting to hear it. In\naddition, sentences are extremely short (and correspondingly easy to\nprocess), while the words used belong to a very limited lexical set\njointly determined by prescribed phraseology and operational\npractice. (p. 2)\nUnfortunately, even in such predictable and restricted circumstances,\nmiscommunications can and do occur, as a result of a number of factors. These can\ninclude pilots not realizing a communication is intended for them, interference on the\nradio frequency, overlapping calls, misunderstood flight parameters, incorrect\nreadbacks, inadequate clarification of flight parameters, and so on (see Cushing,\n1994). An obvious cause of misunderstanding of phraseology can be\nmiscomprehension of pronunciation by one of the interlocutors, particularly if one or\nthe other or both has a regional or nonnative accent in English.\nOne well-known incident, involving Air China 9\u201381 landing at New York\u2019s\nJFK airport (see Harry Chen\u2019s blog at http:\/\/harry.hchen1.com\/2007\/10\/15\/555)\nshowed the Chinese pilot\u2019s English to be incomprehensible, and he also failed to\nunderstand the native-English-speaking air traffic controller. However, the latter also\nfailed to use standard phraseology to communicate with the pilot and his lack of\nsensitivity to the Chinese pilot\u2019s problems reveals a degree of communicative\nincompetence.\nResearch into cognitive factors in air traffic communication, specifically the\ndemands of concurrent tasks in cockpit operations (Farris, Trofimovich, Segalowitz,\n& Gatbonton, 2008; Loukopoulos, Dismukes, & Barshi, 2003) shows both the\ncomplexity of aviation communication settings, and the interaction of second\nlanguage proficiency levels with workload on the accuracy of repeated messages,\neven in routine communications. Native speakers of English are not necessarily\nimmune from poor communication, even in routine communication, as research using\nconversation analysis to examine cockpit conversations has shown (Helmreich, 1994;\nHelmreich, Klinect, & Wilhelm, 1999; Nevile, 2002, 2004; Nevile & Walker, 2005).\nWe will come back to this issue later.\nHowever, more serious miscommunications can occur in unpredictable\nsituations, particularly in emergencies, and especially where urgent corrective action\nor essential information is required, and where one of the interlocutors may be under\nsevere emotional stress. Prescribed procedures exist for emergency calls also, such\nthat the first element of the call should be a distress signal, and the message should be\ncomposed of a number of specified elements, including the name of the ground\nstation being called, the aircraft identifier, the nature of the problem, the pilot\u2019s\nAIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 171\nintention, and the flight parameters of the aircraft (Mell, n.d., p. 2). Nevertheless, and\nunsurprisingly, in emergency circumstances participants may ignore or fail to use\nphraseology and have recourse to what is known as plain (or natural) language.\nWhere the circumstances are unpredictable, where speed and clarity of\ncommunication are of the essence, and where accuracy of comprehension by both\nparties is crucial, the demands on the language proficiency of aircrew and air traffic\ncontrollers can be extreme. This is obviously a concern where one or more of the\nparticipants may not be a native speaker of English.\nThere are a number of well-documented cases where serious fatal accidents\nhave occurred, where a lack of adequate communication between aviation personnel\nfrom different linguistic backgrounds has been a significant contributing factor.\nAccording to Ripley and Finch (2004), in three accidents alone, 1,006 people died at\nleast in part because of language problems that gave rise to communication problems.\nIn November 1996, a Kazakhstan Airline plane collided midair with a Saudi Arabian\nBoeing 747 over Charkhi Dadri, New Delhi, India, killing 351 people. The air traffic\ncontroller was Indian, and the pilots were Saudi and Russian.\nAvianca Flight 052 crashed in April 1991 at Cove Neck, New York, en route\nfrom Bogota Colombia to JFK New York. The crew failed to communicate clearly to\nair traffic control that their aircraft was running out of fuel. The air traffic controller\nalso failed to use communication strategies that might have clarified the actual\nsituation on board the aircraft.\nThe most serious incident occurred at Tenerife airport in 1977, when a KLM\nBoeing 747 collided on take-off during foggy conditions with a Pan Am Boeing 747\nthat was still taxiing up the same runway and had not yet cleared that runway. In this\ncrash, which involved misunderstanding of the phrase \u201cat takeoff,\u201d 583 people lost\ntheir lives. The failure of the senior Dutch pilot of the KLM to recognize that\nmessages between the English-speaking pilot of the Pan Am aircraft and the Spanish\nair traffic controller indicated that the runway was not yet clear. (See YouTube\nreenactment at http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qa4dr6NoWJc and the flight safety\ndatabase record at http:\/\/aviation-safety.net\/database\/record.php?id=19770327-1)\nRecent research focusing on cross-cultural communication and\nmisunderstandings also shows that a lack of linguistic proficiency may combine with\ncultural differences to cause miscommunication in aviation settings (see Merritt &\nRatwatte, 2004; Stratechuk & Beneigh, 2004; Turney, 2004a, 2004b). This may be\nespecially problematic with multicultural cockpit crews, where variables like silence,\nrepair, turn-taking, and overlapping talk, which conversation analysis (Nevile &\nWalker, 2005) has shown to indicate problems of communication, may be very\ndifferently interpreted in different cultures, particularly in combination with\ndifferences in status or authority of participants, potentially giving rise to\nmiscommunication. Clearly, the importance of proficiency in English in aviation\ncommunication cannot, and should not, be underestimated.\n172 ALDERSON\nICAO Language Proficiency Requirements (LPRs)\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a branch of the United\nNations, regulates aviation internationally. It establishes and reviews \u201cinternational\nstandards for the licensing of personnel and aircraft operation, and develops\nprinciples and techniques of air navigation, including meteorology, radio\ncommunication, and rules of the air\u201d (Ragan, 2007, p. 54). As a result of an\nincreasing awareness of the importance of the English language proficiency of pilots\nand air traffic controllers in the safety of aircraft, crew, and passengers, ICAO has\ndeveloped a set of language proficiency requirements (LPRs). These set minimum\nstandards for language proficiency for pilots and air traffic controllers and refer to an\nICAO language proficiency scale, which is to be used both as the basis for test\nconstruction and for the rating of language proficiency. These LPRs set Operational\nLevel 4 on the 6-point scale as the minimum level required for licensure, and at Level\n4, license holders have to be retested; a period of 3 years is recommended. Once a\ncandidate has achieved Level 6, that person licensed is to operate for life.\nThe ICAO Language Proficiency Rating Scale consists of six levels of skill in\nsix areas of language use: pronunciation, structure, vocabulary, fluency,\ncomprehension, and interactions. The definitions of Level 4 in each of these criteria\nare as follows:\nPronunciation (Assumes a dialect and\/or accent intelligible to the\naeronautical community)\nPronunciation, stress, rhythm, and intonation are influenced by the\nfirst language or regional variation but only sometimes interfere with\nease of understanding.\nStructure (Relevant grammatical structures and sentence patterns\nare determined by language functions appropriate to the task.)\nBasic grammatical structures and sentence patterns are used\ncreatively and are usually well controlled. Errors may occur,\nparticularly in unusual or unexpected circumstances, but rarely\ninterfere with meaning.\nVocabulary\nVocabulary range and accuracy are usually sufficient to\ncommunicate effectively on common, concrete, and work-related\ntopics. Can often paraphrase successfully when lacking vocabulary\nin unusual or unexpected circumstances.\nFluency\nProduces stretches of language at an appropriate tempo. There may\nbe occasional loss of fluency on transition from rehearsed or\nAIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 173\nformulaic speech to spontaneous interaction, but this does not\nprevent effective communication. Can make limited use of discourse\nmarkers or connectors. Fillers are not distracting.\nComprehension\nComprehension is mostly accurate on common, concrete, and work\nrelated-topics when the accent or variety used is sufficiently\nintelligible for an international community of users. When the\nspeaker is confronted with a linguistic or situational complication or\nan unexpected turn of events, comprehension may be slower or\nrequire clarification strategies.\nInteractions\nResponses are usually immediate, appropriate, and informative.\nInitiates and maintains exchanges even when dealing with an\nunexpected turn of events. Deals adequately with apparent\nmisunderstandings by checking, confirming, or clarifying.\nThere is some controversy over the quality and empirical basis of these scales\n(see below), but at the time of this writing (January 2009), these scales and the\nassociated LPRs were mandated for use in the assessment of proficiency in the use of\nEnglish for aviation purposes, specifically for licensing, although they are also\nfrequently used as the basis of test construction for placement and achievement as\nwell.\nBy March 5, 2008, air traffic controllers and pilots were required by the\nICAO to have a certificate attesting to their proficiency in the language used for\naeronautical communication. ICAO Document 9835, \u201cManual on the Implementation\nof ICAO Language Proficiency Requirements,\u201d lays out the principles according to\nwhich the language proficiency requirements should be met. Although several\norganizations made every effort to produce suitable tests or assessment procedures by\nthe deadline, in the event an implementation period was allowed, with a new deadline\nof March 2011.\nAviation language tests are obviously extremely high stakes, and it is\ncrucially important that such tests are constructed to the highest possible standards. It\nis, therefore, a matter of considerable concern that certificates attesting to the\nattainment of relevant levels of language proficiency will not be generally required of\naviation personnel until March 2011.\nAviation English Tests\nIn 2006, two years before the ICAO LPRs were due to be implemented, the\nEuropean Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) commissioned\nthe Lancaster Language Testing Research Group to conduct a validation study of the\ndevelopment of a test called ELPAC (English Language Proficiency for Aeronautical\n174 ALDERSON\nCommunication), which was intended to assess the language proficiency of air traffic\ncontrollers.\nDuring the 18 months of this study, an Interim Report was produced, which\nmade recommendations for the improvement of the tests and the associated quality\ncontrol procedures. A Final Report was also produced, which provided a commentary\non the quality of the ELPAC test and made a series of recommendations for further\nquality control measures. The Executive Summary of that Final Report is available at\nhttp:\/\/www.elpac.info\/, accompanied by a commentary on the recommendations by\nEurocontrol. As part of the ELPAC Validation Study, Internet searches for evidence of\nother tests of air traffic control found very little evidence available to attest to the\nquality of the tests for licensure of either pilots or air traffic controllers. It was\ntherefore decided to conduct an independent survey of all providers of tests intended\nfor air traffic control. Alderson (2008) reported on the methodology and findings of\nthat survey, the results of which are summarized below.\nSince the Executive Summary of the ELPAC Validation Study had been\nframed by the Guidelines for Good Practice of the European Association for\nLanguage Testing and Assessment (EALTA) it was decided to base the survey\nquestionnaire on the same Guidelines, which consist of the following headings:\n\u2022 Test Purpose and Specification\n\u2022 Test Design and Item Writing\n\u2022 Test Analysis\n\u2022 Test Administration and Security\n\u2022 Test Revision\n\u2022 Test Washback and Impact\nThe Guidelines are available in full in 34 European languages at\nwww.ealta.eu.org\/guidelines.htm. Alderson and Banerjee (2008) described how the\nquestionnaire was adjusted to meet the needs of the particular aviation\ncontext.\nThe survey, made available on the Internet, consisted of two stages: a filter\nquestionnaire that elicited opinions about the ICAO scales, as well as general\ninformation about aviation English testing (for the results of that first stage, see below\nand Knoch, 2009). The second stage asked detailed follow-up questions and was sent\nto 74 organizations and individuals whose tests were thought to be used for licensure\nof pilots and air traffic controllers. Only 22 relevant responses were received, which\nvaried considerably in quantity and quality. While this disappointing response rate\nmay be indicative of the lack of quality of the tests produced and an associated\nreluctance to admit this in public, nonresponse cannot be taken to indicate lack of\nquality, although it may well indicate lack of public accountability of such\nproviders.\nThe tests used for licensure identified in Alderson (2008) are shown in\nTable 1.\nAIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 175\nTable 1.

Too often,\nconfidentiality was claimed as a reason for not providing essential\ninformation. Too often, vague answers were provided which failed\nto answer the questions asked, and too often, certain test developers\nor organizations simply failed to respond to questions, or even to\nAIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 177\nunderstand what was required, or why it is important to be able to\nsupply relevant information.\nNevertheless, it was reassuring to see that at least some test\ndevelopers took their responsibilities seriously, and made every\neffort, both to answer our questions fully, and to supply additional\ninformation in the form of validation studies. As we agreed to\nmaintain the anonymity of respondents, we cannot identify those\nwho represent good practice in test development, nor those who\nappear not to understand what good practice entails. We can point\nout, however, that,\n\u2022 if test specifications and test content do not match the needs of\ntest-takers,\n\u2022 if test developers and item writers do not have relevant aviation and\nlanguage education experience,\n\u2022 if item writers and test raters are not appropriately trained,\n\u2022 if tests are not adequately pretested on suitably representative and\nsizable samples of test-takers,\n\u2022 if the results of such trials are not suitably analyzed and actions taken\nto address any evident problems,\n\u2022 if test-takers are not aware of how and on what they will be tested\nand how their performance will be rated,\n\u2022 if the reliability of marking is not monitored, calculated and\nreported,\n\u2022 if there is no statistical information available to support the claimed\nlevel of the test, the equivalence of different versions from year to\nyear, and the comparability of the results of different tests purporting\nto measure the same target level of proficiency,\n\u2022 and, above all, perhaps, if reports providing evidence as to the\nthoroughly professional quality of tests are not publicly\navailable,\nthen little or no confidence can be held in the\nmeaningfulness, reliability and validity of several of the aviation\nlanguage tests currently available. Unfortunately, at present, this\nappears to be the case for too many of the tests that we have\nsurveyed, and if other tests exist for the aviation context that have\nnot responded to our survey, then it is highly likely that they, too, fail\nto meet minimal standards of quality. The consequences of\ninadequate language tests being made available to license pilots, air\ntraffic controllers and other aviation personnel are almost too\nfrightening to contemplate (pp. 14\u201315).\nThe main conclusion of the Alderson report is that \u201cmonitoring is required of\nthe quality of language tests used in aviation to ensure they follow accepted\nprofessional standards for language tests and assessment procedures\u201d (p. 1).\n178 ALDERSON\nFurther Surveys\nSurvey of National Civil Aviation Authorities\u2019 Plans for Implementation of ICAO\nLanguage Proficiency Requirements\nAlderson and Hora\u00b4k (2008) reported on a follow-up survey into the plans for\nimplementation of the Language Proficiency Requirements requested of national civil\naviation authorities by the ICAO. The research was carried out in two rounds. Round\n1 addressed an e-mail letter to the person named as responsible for implementation of\nthe LPR in each national civil aviation authority. The letter requested the names of the\ntests that the authority had recognized or approved. Out of the 190 authorities (plus\nfive overseas territories of three of these countries) listed on the ICAO Web site, only\n24 replied to the researchers\u2019 request.\nThe second round involved going back to the ICAO Web site and conducting\na detailed analysis of all replies posted on that Web site as of October 2008. A total of\n53 countries stated that they had complied with regulations requiring the assessment\nof the English language proficiency of pilots and air traffic control staff. Another 53\nhad not supplied ICAO with compliance details and the remaining 89 stated\nnoncompliance.\nHowever, of the 53 stating compliance, different countries replied with\nvarying degrees of information, which rarely constituted evidence of compliance. Of\nthose 14 states that provided estimates of the language proficiency levels of pilots and\nATCs, it is far from clear how accurate these estimates are, as details of the\nassessments are scant and not always obviously relevant.\nAlderson and Hora\u00b4k concluded that\n\u2022 the lack of (evidence for) compliance gives cause for concern;\n\u2022 ongoing detailed monitoring of implementation plans and\ncompliance is essential;\n\u2022 there is reason to suspect that the ICAO\u2019s recommendations with\nrespect to evidence for test quality are not being taken seriously;\n\u2022 the conclusions are confirmed of Alderson (2008) that we can have\nlittle confidence in the quality of several of the aviation language\ntests and assessments currently available for flight crew and air traffic\ncontroller licensure. (p. 1)\nStudy of Stakeholders\u2019 Views of the ICAO Scales\nKnoch (2009) reported on a study of two groups of stakeholders: aviation\nlanguage testing experts and pilots and pilot trainers. An online survey (as reported\nbriefly above) was used with the first group and focus group interviews with the\nsecond, based on recordings of speaking performances of test takers taking a variety\nof aviation English tests. Results from the first group revealed wide criticism of the\nAIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 179\nICAO scale and a range of problems was reported. Informants were evenly split\nbetween believing that the ICAO scales were more useful to English experts or\naviation experts, and whether a Level 4 did or did not represent an adequate level for\noperational flying.\nResults from pilots\u2019 use of the scales showed that they paid less attention to\nsome criteria (e.g., structure) than others, and at times judgments of technical\nknowledge appeared to influence judgments of language ability. The article concludes\nwith recommendations for improvements to the ICAO scales.\nInformal Discussions of Issues Surrounding Aviation Language Testing\nand the ICAO Scales\nThere are a number of discussion fora associated with aviation English\nteaching and testing, and the present author is a member of some. The content of\nthese discussions is assumed to be confidential to members of the fora, but a content\nanalysis of issues recently under discussion is not believed to breach confidentiality or\nanonymity. No claim is made as to the representativeness of the summaries below,\nwhich may, to some extent at least, reflect the bias of this author.\nICAO Scales. ICAO\u2019s recent focus on issues of second language proficiency\nis welcome, and it is acknowledged that ICAO has provided much assistance to\nenhance the quality of tests and assessment processes, particularly Document 9835,\nits harmonization document (ICAO, 2008), and test checklists and speech samples.\nThe current situation was felt to be much better than previously and the awareness of\nlanguage issues is now greater in the aviation community. However, the lack of\nevidence for empirical validation of the LPR scales was commented on, and there was\ndiscussion of, and suggested revisions to, the ICAO Scale. The suitability of the\nICAO speech samples was questioned, with often very poor sound quality and little\nagreement on ICAO levels.\nNeed for Standardization of Raters and Ratings. There is felt to be a great\nneed for training and monitoring of raters, and plans for the development of a rater\naccreditation scheme are being discussed. The likelihood of a global scheme was\ndebated, as was the role of the International Civil Aviation English Association\n(ICAEA) and the ICAO.\nTest Quality. Evidence is needed for the reliability and validity of available\ntests, not merely their commercial success or how many users there are. There is a\ngenerally recognized need for independent audits of tests, raters, and rater training,\nand there was a feeling that inadequate tests should be \u201cnamed and shamed\u201d (with\nrecognition, and examples, of good practice). Many anecdotes were recounted of\nproblems with particular tests, certificates, countries.\nTest Monitoring and Accreditation or Recognition. There is no list of\napproved tests. ICAO does not know which tests are approved by which authority, or\nhow they were approved. What knowledge is there of the need for quality language\n180 ALDERSON\ntests? Who is responsible for quality control? According to its mandate, ICAO sets\nthe ultimate regulatory framework in which all its member States operate; application\nof the regulatory framework is the responsibility of the civil aviation authority of each\nState, but ICAO does operate a (restricted and infrequent) audit oversight. On the\nground, compliance is apparently largely dependent on a lack of proficiency being\nreported by pilots or controllers in operational situations. This is frequently felt to be\nunsatisfactory, and regulatory bodies are sometimes felt to have an ostrich-like\nattitude.\nPolitics and Economics. The politics of getting agreement among all 190\nContracting States of ICAO is clearly an issue. Stakeholders need convincing that it is\nworth spending money on valid English tests, and there is a need for a campaign to\nmake stakeholders aware of the importance of second language proficiency in air\nsafety. Airlines are said to prefer low-cost solutions. Part of the solution might be for\naviation English specialists to work more closely with operational trainers. However,\nin current economic circumstances (and falling profit margins), second language\nproficiency is not recognized as a priority for scarce resources (at least until a major\naccident occurs which is shown to be due to language problems). English teachers or\ntesters are thought to lack credibility within the aviation community. Moreover, pilot\nand air traffic controller associations resist testing.\nCorpus of Aviation Communication via Radio Telephony. Communication\nbetween pilots and ATCs is said to be often very poor, even for native speakers of\nEnglish. The need was expressed for evidence of language-related incidents. Research\ninto such incidents would be greatly facilitated by the development of a corpus of\npilot\u2013pilot and pilot\u2013ATC radiotelephony communication. Such a corpus could\nusefully be complemented by rated and validated speech samples based on properly\nconducted assessment procedures, representatively collected and quality controlled.\nTesting Issues. Considerable discussion was held of a range of testing issues.\nWhat is the value of a language test for ensuring flight safety: Is it not more important\nto observe how language is used under stressful conditions? Are tests (in general, as\nwell as specific tests) an adequate representation of the target language use domain?\nShould English experts or aviation operations experts judge proficiency levels? What\nis the relative value of using human raters versus machine scoring? Should\ncomputer-based tests or face-to-face OPI-style interviews be used? What are the\nmerits and demerits of each? Some feel that the ICAO scale is inadequate for the\nassessment of listening during face-to-face speech performances, and that there is a\nneed for a separate measure of listening comprehension. Does it make sense for each\ncountry or airline operator to develop its own tests, or is there a need for globally\nuniform tests? Is a Level 4 on one test equivalent to a Level 4 on a different test? Are\nthe ICAO scales sufficiently explicit and relevant to guarantee that any test\nconstructed on the basis of the ICAO scales will be at the right level? There would\nappear to be a need for comparative studies.\nNative Speaker Issues. Despite the fact that Level 6 is not defined as native\nspeaker proficiency, which is made clear in Document 9835, at least some civil\nAIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 181\naviation authorities interpret Level 6 as meaning a native speaker level. For example,\nthe UK Civil Aviation Authority states that \u201ca scale of 1 to 6 has been devised where\nnative speakers would be assessed at Level 6.\u201d The document goes on to state that as\nRadiotelephony Operating License Examiners, Type Rating, Flight and Class Rating\nExaminers are not trained in formal language proficiency assessment, the assessments\nthey carry out can only be for proficiency at Level 6.\nIn other words, native speakers of English can be examined at the highest\nlevel\u2014Level 6\u2014by unqualified examiners, and only nonnative speakers have to be\nexamined by qualified language examiners. This is felt by many to be inappropriate,\nsince nonnative speakers are often better at aviation English than native speakers.\nNative speakers are often insensitive to their own language use (lack of language\nawareness)\u2014specifically their inappropriate use of idioms and colloquial language,\nthe likely difficulties nonnative speakers experience in communicating with them, and\nthe need to adapt their speech to their audience. Native speakers should not\nautomatically be granted Level 6, but should be tested in the same way and under the\nsame conditions as nonnative speakers.\nConclusion\nThis article has examined the development of a policy intended to regulate\nthe language proficiency of pilots and air traffic controllers, and has analyzed the state\nof implementation of that policy to date. Serious inadequacies have been found in the\nstate of preparedness of national civil aviation authorities to comply with the ICAO\nregulations. Moreover, it is unclear whether the assessment processes proposed or in\nplace meet international standards for high-stakes language testing. Furthermore,\nthere appears to be no reliable mechanism for overseeing the implementation of the\npolicy and ensuring the quality of the assessment procedures and tests. There is a lack\nof clarity as to where the ultimate responsibility lies for adequate monitoring of the\nquality of such tests and assessment procedures, and who might be held responsible\nfor any accidents that may be shown to be due, in part or in whole, to inadequate\naviation language proficiency.\nClearly, further research is needed, and the issues summarized in the previous\nsection from the discussion board exchanges can be seen as identifying a range of\ntopics for research agendas, as well as matters that need more discussion and attention\nby applied linguists generally, and by the language testing community specifically.\nAspects that seem of particular importance for research include close analysis of the\nlanguage of nonnormal aviation communication; examining the accident reports of\nnational transport safety bureaus and air accidents investigation units; critiquing and\nrevising the ICAO Language Proficiency Requirements Scale and subjecting them to\nempirical investigation and validation; critical reviews and comparisons of available\naviation English tests; and a close examination of the politics of policy development,\nimplementation, and resistance.\nHowever, even more important, it is argued, is the urgent need for some\nmeans of monitoring the quality of the aviation tests and assessment procedures that\nare, or will be, available before March 2011.\n182 ALDERSON\nA suitable conclusion for this article, perhaps, is a quotation from Andy\nRoberts\u2019 wishlist for 2009, posted on one of the aviation English discussion lists and\nreproduced here by permission, which neatly summarizes the key issues needing\nurgent attention:\nI\u2019d like to put my own wishes forward for 2009.\n1. To continue raising the standards of Aviation English levels of\npilots and controllers worldwide.\n2. To have a mechanism to check that countries that post as being\nICAO-compliant on the FSIX Web site really are.\n3. To apply the recommended guidelines for test construction to both\ntests and the rating scale.\n4. To have a mechanism to check that tests and training do what they\nclaim to do.\nANNOTATED REFERENCES\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). (2004).

Matters discussed include the need for linguistic awareness, the\nimportance of cross-cultural communication, the nature of radiotelephony\ncommunications, relevant language training, compliance with the language\nproficiency requirements, and aviation language testing. Appendix A Part II\nincludes the ICAO Language Proficiency Rating Scale and a set of\nAIR SAFETY, LANGUAGE ASSESSMENT POLICY, AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION 183\nexplanations as Additional Information; Appendix B presents a useful\nanalysis of aviation language, including communicative functions, events and\ndomains, lexis and language tasks. Appendix C describes two case studies in\naviation language testing\u2013surprisingly, the OPI and PELA (a placement test,\nnot a test for licensure); Appendix D presents standards for language training\nand testing, including the ILTA Code of Ethics and the Japanese Language\nTesting Association\u2019s Code of Practice; and Appendix E has a useful set of\nreferences.\nWhile containing much useful information, the manual is probably\nsimply too specialized for national civil aviation authorities to follow in its\nentirety, although it is a useful point of reference, and it would be very\nhelpful if (1) a detailed critical review and set of recommendations were to\nbe made with respect to the content of the manual and (2) a brief, informative\ndigest were available for lay users.
