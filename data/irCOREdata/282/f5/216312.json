Much of this expansion has taken place in the world\u2019s \u2018geopolitical blackholes\u2019 (\u00d3 \nTuathail, 2000: 170), spaces of instability where rising levels of conflict have been \naccompanied by economic collapse, human rights abuses and loss of life (Mullenbach, \n2005, O'Loughlin, 2005, Silberfein, 2004). PKOs have sought to bring an end to hostilities, \nprevent further conflict, provide humanitarian assistance and facilitate post-conflict state-\nbuilding (Diehl, 1988: 487, Ku and Jacobson, 2003). The central aim of this paper is to \nprovide new understanding into the geographic factors which shape states\u2019 uneven \nparticipation in post-Cold War PKOs. \nOur contribution advances on previous research in three ways. First, we examine the \ninfluence of a far wider set of geographic attributes on countries\u2019 uneven participation in \nPKOs, including aspects of spatial and relational proximity largely overlooked in previous \nwork. Second, departing from previous monadic analyses, we analyse a novel dyadic \ndataset which records individual countries\u2019 participation in specific PKOs. And third, \nunlike a number of past studies, which have focused exclusively on NATO (Shimizu and \nSandler, 2003) or United Nations (UN) (Khanna et al., 1999) operations, we examine \npeacekeeping under the auspices of both the UN, regional intergovernmental organizations \n(IGOs) and ad hoc \u201ccoalitions of the willing.\u201d \nOur results suggest that more democratic and human rights respecting countries \nhave a higher probability of providing troops for multilateral PKOs. Aspects of spatial \n 4 \nproximity (physical distance, same region) and relational proximity (colonial ties) between \n(potential) sending and receiving states are also found to raise the likelihood of \nparticipation in post-Cold War operations. Yet relational linkages via bilateral trade and \njoint membership of IGOs \u2013 two of the cornerstones of the so-called \u201cKantian peace\u201d \n(Kinsella and Russett, 2002; Oneal et al., 1996) \u2013 fail to emerge as statistically significant \npredictors of countries\u2019 participation in PKOs. \nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly outlines the changing \nnature of peacekeeping and summarises the findings of previous research. Section 3 \noutlines our conceptual framework and theoretically-inspired predications. Variables, \nmeasures and estimation methods are detailed in section 4. Section 5 presents results, while \nsection 6 concludes.  \n \nPOST-COLD WAR PEACEKEEPING \n \nMultilateral peacekeeping has changed significantly during the post-Cold War period. One \ndifference (already noted) is the number of operations. For example, UN-commanded \nPKOs tripled from 12 during the period 1947-87 to reach 36 over 1988-2001 (Jakobsen, \n2002: 270). Another difference is the targets of intervention. From a predominant focus on \ninter-state conflict during the Cold War period, a large share of PKOs over the past two \ndecades has targeted countries experiencing intra-state hostilities. Moreover, the objectives \nof intervention have expanded to include a growing number of operations incorporating \nhumanitarian and state-building functions (Ku and Jacobson, 2003, Wheeler, 2002), \nalthough most authors continue (as we do here) to use peacekeeping as a catch-all term to \n 5 \ndescribe these varied activities. The post-Cold War period has also witnessed a heightened \nrole for non-UN operations. As during the Cold War, UN-commanded operations have \ncontinued to dominate multilateral peacekeeping (accounting for approximately half of all \noperations), but a growing number of operations have been orchestrated by regional\/sub-\nregional IGOs and \u201ccoalitions of the willing\u201d, i.e. \u2018groups of actors that come together, \noften around a pivotal state, to launch a joint operation in response to particular crises\u2019 \n(Bellamy and Williams, 2005: 169).1 These two sets of actors have respectively accounted \nfor approximately 25% of PKOs \u2013 a share which has remained broadly similar over the \nperiod of our study. Another difference is the range of participating countries, with a rising \nnumber and diversity of developing nations contributing to post-Cold War peacekeeping \nduties (Bellamy and Williams, 2005, Bobrow and Boyer, 1997, Jones, 2004, Neack, 1995, \nNeethling, 2004).  \nStates\u2019 commitment to multilateral peacekeeping has nevertheless remained highly \ngeographically uneven. Approximately one-third of countries have abstained from \npeacekeeping altogether, while amongst active peacekeepers, certain states have \nparticipated in a far larger number of operations. Most importantly for the analysis here, \nindividual countries have also proved selective in where they send their peacekeepers, \ndemonstrating a greater propensity to volunteer for PKOs in specific countries than others \n(Neack, 1995, Pugh, 2004, Solomon, 2007).  \nPrevious large-N, quantitative research into the uneven geography of peacekeepers \nhas predominantly focused on aspects of the so-called \u201cpeacekeeping burden\u201d, i.e. states\u2019 \nrelative contribution to the overall financial and\/or personnel requirements of PKOs. Most, \nbut not all, of these studies have found that more powerful countries contribute more to the \n 6 \noverall peacekeeping burden (Bobrow and Boyer, 1997, Lebovic, 2004, Shimizu and \nSandler, 2002). They have also shown that democratic polities are far more likely to carry \nthe burden for PKOs than autocracies (Andersson, 2002, Lebovic, 2004).  \nAlthough instructive, we find these studies unsatisfactory. Most importantly, \nprevious work has not gone far in examining extra-domestic influences on peacekeeping \ncontributions, focusing predominantly on the domestic attributes of sending states. To be \nsure, territorially-bounded characteristics are central elements of place, and therefore \nimportant to geographers\u2019 understanding of uneven peacekeeping contributions \n(O\u2019Loughlin, 2000). Indeed, in the present paper, we examine a number of these country-\nspecific, internal factors, both as main explanatory and control variables. Yet territory is not \nan isolated container. As well as internal factors, such as the characteristics of the \nterritorially-bounded community, the contextual environment is also constituted through \nexternal interactions, interests and influences beyond the boundaries of the state (Flint, \n2004).  \nTo be fair, previous studies have not ignored extra-domestic aspects outright, but \nthey have adopted a narrow conception of them. Thus, Khanna et al. (1999) finds that trade \nopenness is positively correlated with certain countries\u2019 peacekeeping contributions, while \nLebovic (2004) shows that countries with security ties to the US are more likely to \nparticipate in PKOs. Missing from these analyses, however, is any consideration of \nlinkages between (potential) troop sending and receiving countries. This omission is \ncurious: it is entirely plausible that extra-domestic linkages might influence both the \nincentives to participate, as well as countries\u2019 ability to do so. \n 7 \nA major reason for this omission is previous studies\u2019 reliance on geographically-\naggregated, monadic data. Although entirely appropriate to investigating questions of \nburden sharing, monadic analyses have been unable to explore the influence of various \ndyadic linkages between peacekeeper sending and receiving countries. Our study seeks to \nrectify this shortcoming by using dyadic data to explore the influence of internal and \nexternal contextual factors on states\u2019 uneven participation in multilateral PKOs.  \n \nCONCEPTUALISING PARTICIPATION IN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS \n \nAlthough multilateral peacekeeping is voluntary, the choice of whether or not to participate \nis by no means unproblematic (Diehl, 1988, Jakobsen, 2002). Thus, peacekeeping is \npolitically, legally and morally contentious on account of the fact that it involves the \nexercise of extra-territorial influence, violating the supposed immutability of insular forms \nof sovereignty (Agnew, 2005; Dodds, 2005). Sending peacekeepers is also potentially \ncostly, and exposes countries to varying degrees of risk (for soldiers\u2019 lives, countries\u2019 \nreputation, etc.) (Chopra, 1996, Mingst, 2003, Welsh, 2003). Two implications follow from \nthese observations. The first is that individual states must possess interests in dispatching \npeacekeepers for a specific operation (Nye, 2003). Second, a country\u2019s participation must \nbe perceived as legitimate, not only by domestic constituencies, but also influential actors \nwithin target states and the wider international community (Wheeler, 2002). It is our \ncontention that states\u2019 participation in particular operations will be determined by a range \nof domestic and extra-domestic factors which shape interests in peacekeeping and their \nability to legitimate intervention.2  \n 8 \nAccording to realists, interests in peacekeeping are self-serving, strategic and \nmaterialist in orientation, with participation seen as a means to advance a state\u2019s power, \ngeopolitical influence and prosperity (Pilger, 1999; Pugh, 2004). Another school of \nthought, closely aligned with liberal theories of International Relations, maintains that \ncountries\u2019 interests in PKOs are more idealistic in nature, and bound-up with domestic \nconcerns about human rights, freedom and democracy. Although different interests will \npredominate at different times, we believe that both materialist and idealist interests will \npositively influence a state\u2019s decision to provide personnel for a particular PKO (Nye, \n2003).  \n    Even if it is in the interests of states to intervene, willing peacekeepers face a range \nof constraints which limit their ability to participate. One constraint is capacity and, \nspecifically, the availability of financial, bureaucratic and military resources required to \ndeploy, operate and maintain peacekeepers. What concerns us more here is a second \nconstraint, namely, legitimacy (Bellamy and Williams, 2005, Welsh, 2003). The need for \nlegitimacy arises because deploying personnel to \u201cpolice\u201d conflict transgresses the \nterritorial norm of authoritative sovereignty (Agnew, 2005, Biersteker, 2002). Actors who \nviolate this principle must therefore command, construct or otherwise demonstrate \nlegitimate reasons \u2013 moral, legal or political \u2013 for doing so. Failure to command or \nconstruct sufficient justification for intervention can have a range of negative \nconsequences, ranging from reputational damage amongst members of the international \ncommunity, domestic political opposition through to difficulties securing the consent to \nparticipate in a PKO by belligerents in the target state (Diehl, 1988; Falah et al., 2006).   \n 9 \nAccepting our basic premise, we now turn to the factors influencing interests and \nlegitimacy. We conceptualise these into three categories: (1) domestic values, norms and \npractices; (2) spatial proximity and; (3) relational proximity. Although discussed separately, \nwe suggest that these factors combine to create the contextual setting in which decisions \nregarding whether to participate in particular PKOs are made by domestic actors.   \n \nDomestically-Institutionalised Values, Norms and Practices  \n \nOur first category draws its inspiration from theories of domestic politics which emphasise \nthe role of domestic political actors, interests and institutions in shaping state policy \n(Gourevitch, 2002). We focus here on two broad areas of domestically-institutionalised \nvalues, norms and associated practices: democracy and human rights. Our basic expectation \nis that countries which are more democratic or committed to human rights are more likely \nto provide troops for PKOs.  \nExpanding on liberal theories of the so-called \u201cdemocratic peace\u201d (Owen, 1994), \nscholars have recently suggested that democracies are more likely to be disposed towards \nspreading democracy to non-democratic territorial spaces, sometimes by force. Central to \nthese claims is the idea that democratic polities regard the creation, maintenance and \nexpansion of well-functioning democracies as part of the national interest, supporting \nmutually beneficial stability, security and prosperity (Lebovic, 2004). Along similar lines, it \nis suggested that modern democratic values create normative obligations to defend human \nrights, dignity and good governance, which states seek to meet out of reputational reasons \n(Andersson, 2002). Others have argued that democracies are more inclined towards \n 10 \nmultilateral approaches to addressing various forms of global disorder (Ikenberry, 2001). \nWhether for one or more of these reasons, we suggest that democratic polities are likely to \npossess greater interests in multilateral peacekeeping, and therefore be more willing to \nparticipate in multilateral PKOs. These predications about the importance of polity are \nsupported by recent large-N empirical studies: Andersson (2002) shows that democracies \ncontributed more to UN PKOs over the period 1991-99, while Lebovic (2004) reaches the \nsame conclusion for UN operations between 1993-2001. \nA second domestic attribute is concern for and commitment to human rights. As \nevidenced by countries\u2019 growing willingness to volunteer personnel in conflicts \ncharacterized by human rights violations, atrocities and large-scale suffering, human rights \nand welfare have been increasingly important factors in post-Cold War PKOs (Dodds, \n2005, Jakobsen, 2002, Ku and Jacobson, 2003, Welsh, 2003). For some, this new-found \nenthusiasm is largely a matter of popular demand, with publics concerned about human \nrights exerting \u201cbottom-up\u201d political demand for humanitarian interventions (Byman and \nWaxman, 2002, Chopra, 1996, O'Loughlin and Kolossov, 2002, \u00d3 Tuathail, 2000). Others \nhave emphasised the changing values of domestic political elites who, it is suggested, have \nprogressively incorporated norms of human rights protection into their conception of the \nnational interest (Wheeler, 2002). Either way, it follows that countries whose publics and\/or \nleadership value human rights, and believe that states have a duty to intervene to protect the \nfundamental rights of extra-territorial others, are more likely to possess interests in \ndispatching peacekeepers. Furthermore, it is possible that countries which care more and \nare more committed to human rights are more likely to be seen as legitimate parties in \n 11 \npeacekeeping operations, and therefore face fewer political barriers to their participation in \nextra-territorial operations.  \n The considerations so far lead to the following hypotheses: \n \nHypothesis 1. More democratic countries are more likely to send troops to PKOs. \n \nHypothesis 2. Countries which are more committed to human rights are more likely to send \ntroops to PKOs. \n \nSpatial Proximity \n \nA second set of factors considered here relate to spatial proximity and, more specifically, \nvarious aspects of the (potential) sending country\u2019s position in physical space vis-\u00e0-vis the \nreceiving one. The importance of spatial proximity has been widely recognised in the \ngeopolitical and international relations literature (Gleditsch and Ward, 2001; Tir and Diehl, \n2002; Xierali and Lui, 2006). Within the present context, one way in which proximity is \nlikely to matter is by influencing the geo-strategic gains from intervention. Actual or \naspirant regional powers may be more inclined to participate in \u201cbackyard\u201d PKOs because \nsuch interventions are more compatible with self-interests in maintaining or extending \ngeopolitical influence over the critically important \u201cnear abroad\u201d (Bellamy and Williams, \n2005, Lyons, 1998, Neethling, 2004, Pilger, 1999). Another, arguably more important, \nreason why spatially proximate countries might demonstrate a greater willingness to \nparticipate is that they are more likely to experience, or fear that they will experience, the \n 12 \nnegative spillovers from nearby conflict (\u00d3 Tuathail, 2000). These real and\/or perceived \nspillovers include refugees and economic-cum-political instability arising from the spread \nof conflict to neighbouring states which, it is suggested, create domestic interests in \npeacekeeping (Byman and Waxman, 2002, Mingst, 2003; Murdoch and Sandler, 2002, \nShimizu and Sandler, 2002). Indeed, precisely because of these readily apparent material \ninterests, governments will likely find it easier to convince the public that there are \nlegitimate grounds for intervening, and therefore secure their consent for sending \npeacekeepers (Dodds, 2000, O'Loughlin and Kolossov, 2002).  \nIn reality, there are a number of different aspects of spatial proximity, and their \ninfluence may vary (Gleditsch and Ward, 2001; Tir and Diehl, 2002). Three are examined \nhere. The first is physical distance between the (potential) sending and receiving state \nwhich we anticipate to be negatively correlated with participation. A second, more \nambiguous, dimension of spatial proximity is contiguity. At one level, there is a case for \nexpecting contiguous countries to be more willing peacekeepers, not least because they are \nlikely to be most affected by refugees, economic turbulence, etc. As immediate neighbours, \nhowever, contiguous countries are more likely to be subject to boundary disputes (Clark \nand Regan, 2003, Kinsella and Russett, 2002). Likewise, contiguity also provides increased \nopportunities for the projection of \u201cunwelcome\u201d power, influence and interference by one \nstate over another, giving rise to political tensions between contiguous countries \n(Silberfein, 2004, Tir and Diehl, 2002). We might therefore expect one or both disputants in \nthe target country to show a greater reluctance to sanction the involvement of neighbouring \nstates, while IGOs and\/or regional hegemons might similarly be reluctant to include \n 13 \nimmediate neighbours in PKOs owing to questions over the legitimacy of their involvement \n(Lebovic, 2004).  \nA third dimension of spatial proximity is regional location. We argue that countries \nare more likely to participate in PKOs where the target state is located in the same world \nregion. Although regional \u201cmembership\u201d is likely to pick-up a number of distance-related \neffects,3 the regional influence will include several additional factors which are not a simple \nfunction of distance. Included here are a whole set of economic (e.g. regional production \nnetworks) and political (e.g. membership in regional inter-governmental bodies) \nrelationships. Also potentially included are shared cultural norms, institutions and \ndiplomatic networks (Buzan, 2004). Together, these regional linkages, mutual \ndependencies and commonalities might plausibly foster recognition of shared obligations, \nroles and interests amongst countries located in the same region, increasing the incentive \nfor countries to dispatch peacekeepers. At the same time, a combination of heightened \nfamiliarity, mutual understanding and trust, might render a particular country a more \nlegitimate party in domestic affairs, and therefore raise the readiness of domestic \nbelligerents to sanction the involvement or invite nearby states.  \n An additional way regional location might influence peacekeeping contributions is \nthrough neighbourhood spatial contagion. As discussed in other contexts, countries\u2019 \nbehaviour may be strategically interdependent, in the sense that the actions of one state in a \nregion may be linked to the actions of other states in the same region (Starr, 1991; Ward \nand Gleditsch, 2002). An important corollary is that patterns of geopolitical behaviour may \nbecome spatially clustered. Applied to peacekeeping, we might expect the probability of \nany one country participating rising as more states in the same region also participate. \n 14 \nAgain, many of the same contextual factors which influence interests and legitimacy \noutlined above may result in countries \u201cmoving together\u201d, e.g. heightened levels of trust, \nco-operation and communication, the presence of regional IGOs instrumental in initiating, \norchestrating staffing PKOs (Bellamy and Williams, 2005, Neethling, 2004). A closely-\nrelated reason why states may move together centres on the idea that extra-territorial \npeacekeeping demonstrates public good characteristics. Reducing conflict, instability and \nsuffering through the provision of troops may well deliver benefits to all countries in the \nsame region, but the costs of PKOs will fall exclusively to willing participants, creating an \nincentive for individual states to \u201cfree-ride\u201d (Solomon, 2007). Aware of these potential \nasymmetries, states may be unwilling to contribute to peacekeeping efforts unless their \nregional peers do so, such that participation is only likely to happen as part of a regionally-\nconcerted effort to overcome the collective action problem. We capture these regional \nsending propensity dynamics in our research design through the use of a spatial lag \nvariable. \n In sum, our spatial proximity expectations lead to the following hypotheses: \n  \n Hypothesis 3. Countries which are physically closer (in continuous terms) to the \ntarget state are more likely to send troops. \n  \n Hypothesis 4a. States which are contiguous to the country hosting the PKO have a \nhigher probability of sending peacekeepers. \n Hypothesis 4b. States which are contiguous to the country hosting the PKO have a \nlower probability of sending peacekeepers. \n 15 \n \n Hypothesis 5. Countries from the same geographic region as the target state are \nmore likely to contribute troops to PKOs. \n \n Hypothesis 6. Participation by more states from the same region in a PKO increases \nthe chances that an individual state will also provide troops. \n \nRelational Proximity \n \nInteractions, engagement and interdependencies between individual states are not simply a \nfunction of spatial proximity. They also depend on \u201ccloseness\u201d in terms of the strength of \nboundary-spanning relational ties linking different territories. As with physical distance, \nthese ties can be seen as a way through which foreign countries enter the moral, policy and \ninterest space of actors in distanciated places, and are domestically embedded to become \npart of the contextual setting which governs peacekeeping decisions.  \nThe idea that international contact, communication and interdependence fosters \npeaceful interactions has long been recognised in theories of the Kantian peace (Kinsella \nand Russett, 2002; Oneal et al., 1996). We take these ideas further in the present paper to \nargue that participation in peacekeeping is more likely when (potential) troop senders are \nmore relationally proximate to recipient states \u2013 in the sense of being more closely-tied via \none of a number of international linkages. One such linkage, and one of the classic pillars \nof the Kantian peace, is international trade. To the extent that conflict and instability \nthreaten economically beneficial exchange, countries should have material self-interests in \n 16 \nsending peacekeepers to important trading partners. Similar ideas have been espoused by \n\u201cpopular\u201d critics of peacekeeping, who point to the reluctance of Western countries to send \ntroops to conflicts where they lack direct economic interests (Pilger, 1999). More generally, \nowing to higher levels of (often mutually beneficial) economic dependence, mutual \nacquaintance and strength of (commercially-derived) diplomatic ties, important trading \npartners are more likely to be deemed legitimate participants by belligerents in the target \nstate, orchestrators of PKOs, etc.  \n A second set of relational linkages which might plausibly shape participation in a \nparticular PKO are colonial ties. Although highly variable in its nature, modalities and \nimpacts, colonialism gave rise to a host of enduring social, economic and political legacies, \nranging from joint educational programmes to foreign investments (Gwynne et al., 2003). \nAs with trade, we anticipate these ties creating ongoing interests on the part of the former \ncolonizing state in the welfare, stability and prosperity of their former colonies. At the same \ntime, a combination of familiarity, trust and long-established diplomatic relationships also \nmean that ex-colonies might see their former colonial masters as more legitimate \npeacekeepers, and therefore sanction their domestic involvement. Over recent decades, the \nlegacy of colonial ties has also increasingly assumed normative dimensions, with countries \nfacing growing international and domestic pressures to exercise their \u201cmoral\u201d responsibility \ntowards former colonies by addressing conflict, instability and unrest (Lyons, 1998). \nIndeed, such factors may explain observations that a number of high-profile PKOs in Africa \nduring the post-Cold War period have been initiated or staffed by former colonial powers \n(Bellamy and Williams, 2005, Diehl, 1988).  \n 17 \nA third relational tie considered here is migrant linkages. According to the \nliterature, migrant communities perform a boundary-spanning role, with transnational \nallegiances held by foreign populations creating domestic political interests in extra-\nterritorial spaces. Through lobbying, strategic voting, media influence, etc., migrant \ncommunities may seek to represent and advance these interests, exerting potentially \nsignificant pressure on governments to assist their \u201chome\u201d countries (Popescu, 2005, Shain, \n1994-95). Indeed, several authors have documented how \u201cdiaspora politics\u201d have been \ninfluential in moulding target countries\u2019 foreign policies, particularly in areas involving \nself-determination, democracy and human rights (Carter, 2005, Dodds, 2000, Haney and \nVanderbush, 1999). A high number of migrants from the target state might also help a \ngovernment in the (potential) troop sending country to secure domestic legitimacy for \nintervention. Inevitably, the geographic distribution of migrants will be bound-up with the \ngeography of colonial ties, but far from exclusively so (Moore and Shellman, 2007). Thus, \neven taking account of colonial relationships, it is quite possible that boundary-spanning \nmigrant ties will influence countries\u2019 propensity to intervene.  \nAs well as transnational ties between individual sovereign territories, bilateral \nrelational linkages and interdependencies are created at the supranational level through \njoint membership of international organisations, another of the classic pillars of the Kantian \npeace (Hafner-Burton and Montgomery, 2006). Membership of particular IGOs potentially \nascribes new or heightened responsibilities upon countries, including a duty to assist other \nmembers. A combination of increased peer monitoring, diplomatic communication and \nreputational considerations provide countries with incentives not to ignore the plight of \nfellow states whose populations are experiencing humanitarian distress. Through \n 18 \ninteraction, cooperation and joint problem solving, the stability, prosperity and well-being \nof other members may also come to enter the geo-strategic interest space of joint IGO \nparticipants. By fostering dialogue, mutual understanding and trust, states might \nadditionally be more inclined to treat countries who are members of a larger number of the \nsame IGOs as legitimate parties, and therefore welcome intervention.  \nHence we propose the following hypotheses: \n \nHypothesis 7. Countries which are more dependent on trade with the target state are \nmore likely to provide troops. \n \nHypothesis 8. Ex-colonial powers are more likely to participate in PKOs located in \ntheir former colonies. \n \nHypothesis 9. A higher share of the global stock of target state migrants residing in \na potential sending country will increase the probability of participation. \n \nHypothesis 10. Countries are more likely to provide troops for PKOs where they are \njoint members of a larger number of IGOs with the target state. \n \n 19 \nMETHOD \n \nDependent Variable \nThe dependent variable in our main estimations is a dummy variable, set to one if the \npotential sending country participates in a PKO in the receiving country in a particular year, \nor zero if it does not. Data for the dependent variable were extracted from the Stockholm \nInternational Peace Research Institute\u2019s \u2018Multilateral Peace Operations Database\u2019(SIPRI, \n2007). Amongst others, the database records the location of PKOs, as well as the identities \nof contributing states. \nWe restrict our focus to PKOs involving the deployment of military troops.4 As the \nmost politically, economically and legally contentious aspect of multilateral peacekeeping, \nwe expect countries\u2019 troop sending actions to be especially revealing about the nature of \nextra-territoriality. Military troops are invariably armed and are at a far greater risk of \ncasualties than is the case for other categories of peacekeepers. Certainly, their involvement \nis likely to say a great deal more than civilian personnel, especially in relation to \ngeopolitically interesting questions about the incentives and constraints governing the \nprojection of state power, influence and control across sovereign borders.  \nIt could be argued that our binary participation\/no participation dependent variable \nignores potentially significant differences in troop numbers and\/or financial payments \ncontributed by individual countries, and therefore the actual degree of commitment. Yet \nthis argument needs to be set against the fact that the very act of sending troops is highly \npolitically significant in its own right. Indeed, once a state has decided to commit, we \nexpect the actual number of troops sent to be heavily influenced by its military capacity, per \n 20 \ncapita income or level of compensatory payments. Neither of these variables is of central \ninterest in the present study. In any case, we have no information on the size of the troop \ncontributions, and therefore would not be able to construct an appropriate variable. \n \nIndependent Variables \nWe use two variables to capture our first set of hypothesised attributes, i.e. domestic norms, \nvalues and practices. Democratic polity is proxied by the Polity IV Project\u2019s polity2 \nindicator (Marshall et al., 2006), while a county\u2019s concerns for and commitment to human \nrights is proxied by Gibney\u2019s (2007) respect for human rights measure. A number of \ndifferent measures could be used to capture our second set of hypothesised attributes, \ncentred around spatial proximity, each with their advantages and disadvantages (Gleditsch \nand Ward, 2001). We use three widely-used measures here. The first, physical distance, is \nmeasured in kilometres between the two countries\u2019 capital cities. A second, contiguity, is \nmeasured using a dummy variable for dyads sharing a land border or being separated by \nless than 150 miles of sea. Distance and contiguity data are obtained from Bennett and \nStam (2005). Finally, the World Bank\u2019s (2006) classification of world regions is used to \ncode whether the two countries are located in the same region. This information is also used \nto construct the regional sending propensity variable which, in fact, represents a spatial lag \nin dyadic data.5 \n A third set of main explanatory variables capture four dimensions of relational \nproximity. Bilateral trade is measured relative to the sending country\u2019s GDP using data \nfrom Gleditsch (2002) and World Bank (2006). Colonial ties are captured using a dummy \nvariable which denotes whether a potential sending state exercised colonial control over the \n 21 \ncountry in which the PKO is located. We include Russia in this definition since its \nimposition of political and military control over ex-Soviet territories has been analogous to \nthat exercised by the classic Western and Japanese colonisers. A third variable measures the \nshare of the global migrant stock \u2013 that is, migrants from the state hosting a particular PKO \n\u2013 residing in a potential troop sending country. Bilateral migrant stock data are taken from \nParsons et al. (2007). \nData for the joint membership of IGOs variable is from Hensel (2005). The variable \nmeasures the number of IGOs \u2013 and, more precisely, intergovernmental organisations \nrequiring participants to settle disputes peacefully \u2013 in which country pairs are both \nmembers. We purposely chose this measure (over alternative ones which capture all IGO \nmemberships, regardless of the organisation\u2019s security remit) in order to ensure that we \nspecifically test the influence of IGO relationships which might plausibly influence the \ndecision to intervene for peacekeeping purposes.  \n \nControl Variables  \nOur main estimation model features two control variables. We include military power to \ntake account of the possibility that militarily stronger countries \u2013 which presumably are \nbetter positioned to send, operate and maintain troops \u2013 will participate in a greater number \nof PKOs. Military power is measured according to the widely used Composite Index of \nNational Capacity (CINC) score, taken from the Correlates of War project (Singer et al., \n1972).6 A country\u2019s CINC score is a composite of its total population, urban population, \niron and steel production, energy consumption, military personnel and military expenditure. \nA second variable is gross domestic product (GDP) per capita which we include to control \n 22 \nfor relative income. All else equal, richer countries are likely to be better-positioned to \nabsorb the costs of deploying troops, and therefore more willing and able to participate in a \nlarger number of operations. Data are from World Bank (2006).  \n \nEstimation Approach \nIn our main estimations, we take the population of multilateral PKOs as given, and merely \nanalyze what determines country participation in these operations. Given our dependent \nvariable is a binary one, we employ a logit estimator.7 Standard errors are assumed to be \nclustered on country dyads. With nearly half a million observations, failure to cluster \nstandard errors would lead to a large under-estimation of standard errors, owing to the fact \nthat observations from different years within the same dyad cannot be said to be \nindependently sampled. \nIt is possible that decisions of countries to participate in PKOs, on the one hand, and \nthe decision about whether a PKO takes place, on the other, are not independent of one \nother. In a separate robustness test, we adopt a two-stage estimation method which controls \nfor potential sample selection bias, details of which are presented later. \n \nSample \nA lack of data for some variables means that our sample does not feature all countries in the \nworld. Our sample in the main estimations comprises 150 countries, both developed and \ndeveloping, and the unit of analysis the dyad year. The number of dyad years in which a \ncountry contributes troops for PKOs ranges from zero (51 countries never send any troops) \nto 40 (the United Kingdom tops the list of sending countries in our sample). The average \n 23 \nnumber of dyad years in which countries send troops is eight with a standard deviation of \n10.3. \n \nRESULTS \n \nTable 1 shows our main estimation results. The first model excludes, while the second \nmodel includes, the spatial lag variable. For the estimations without the spatial lag, results \nbroadly support a priori expectations. Thus, democratic polity is positively and statistically \nsignificantly correlated with PKO participation, indicating that more democratic countries \nare more likely to send troops. The estimated coefficient for human rights protection is \nsignificantly negative which, as anticipated, suggests that countries with greater concern for \nand commitment to human rights are more likely to participate in PKOs.  \nOur findings also provide qualified empirical support for the idea that a target \ncountry\u2019s spatial proximity promotes participation. The estimated coefficient for distance is \nnegative and statistically significant. This is entirely plausible: the \u201cnegative\u201d spillovers of \nconflict are more likely to be experienced by nearby countries, creating domestic interests, \nlegitimacy and support for sending troops (Bobrow and Boyer, 1997, Byman and Waxman, \n2002, Shimizu and Sandler, 2002). We additionally find statistically robust evidence that \ncountries are more likely to participate in PKOs located in their own region. Although a \nwhole series of factors could explain this result, it is nevertheless consistent with the idea \nthat macro-regions constitute geographically distinctive spaces, bound together by dense \ninter-state relations, shared interests and mutual recognition of legitimacy (Buzan, 2004, \nO'Loughlin and Kolossov, 2002). Yet our estimated coefficient for contiguity is statistically \n 24 \ninsignificant. At one level, this result is surprising: countries might be expected to possess \ngreater interests in tackling potentially costly conflict, instability and humanitarian crises in \nbordering states. However, it may be that these positive incentives are offset by historic \nanimosities between contiguous countries, which constrain the ability of immediate \nneighbours to legitimate intervention (Kocs, 1995, Mitchell and Prins, 1999, Silberfein, \n2004).  \nTurning to relational forms of proximity, we find mixed evidence for the role of \ndistanciated forms of geographic influence. Confirming anecdotal observations, our dummy \nvariable denoting former colonial powers (including the quasi-colonial status of Russia) is \npositively and statistically significantly correlated with participation (Diehl, 1988, Jones, \n2004, Neethling, 2004, Silberfein, 2004). Yet we find that the share of the target state\u2019s \nglobal migrant stock residing in a particular country does not have a significantly \ndiscernible influence on the latter\u2019s probability of intervening. The estimated coefficient is \npositive, but it is not statistically significant at the 10% level. Our remaining two relational \nvariables, bilateral trade and joint membership of IGOs, are also both statistically \ninsignificant.  \nWe now turn to our second model which includes our spatial lag variable. As \nexpected, we find evidence of strategic interdependence amongst states located in the same \nregion, in that our estimated coefficient for regional sending propensity is positive and \nstatistically significant.8 Put simply, our results strongly indicate that the probability of a \ncountry sending troops to a particular PKO rises with participation by other states in the \nsame region. The inclusion of the spatial lag variable leaves results for our main variables \n 25 \nof interest largely unchanged, with the exception of same region which becomes \nstatistically insignificant.  \nFinally, we turn to our control variables. Capturing the effect of superior capacity to \nproject extra-territorial influence, our estimated coefficients for military capacity is positive \nand statistically significant. Similarly, consistent with the idea that richer countries are \nbetter able to afford the costs of sending peacekeepers, we estimate a positive relationship \nbetween GDP per capita and participation. Note, GDP becomes statistically insignificant \nwhen we include our spatial lag variable capturing regional sending propensity, most likely \nbecause of the regional clustering of countries at roughly similar levels of GDP per capita \u2013 \nand, in particular, the strong propensity of the relatively rich, Western European countries \nfor concerted peacekeeping activity. The differences in regional sending propensity across \nregions and their effect on the likelihood of sending troops cancels the effect that \ndifferences in GDP per capita across countries has on this likelihood. \n Statistical significance is not equivalent to substantive importance. In order to shed \nlight on the relative impact of different determinants, we report as additional information \nthe percentage change in next to the coefficient (but only for coefficients that are \nstatistically significantly different from zero) following a one standard deviation increase in \nthe case of continuous variables, or a change from zero to one in the case of the dummy \nvariables, for which standard deviation changes make little sense. For the model without \nthe spatial lag, we find that the most important variable is colony, followed by democracy, \nsame region, distance, military capacity, human rights and GDP per capita. In the model \nthat includes the spatial lag, the order is little different, with the lag itself among the \nsubstantially most important variables. Thus, colony is most important, followed by \n 26 \nregional sending propensity, democracy, military capacity, distance, human rights and \nmigrant share. \n \nRobustness Test \nAs an additional robustness test, we take into account potential sample selection bias, \narising from the fact that the geography of peacekeeping is determined over two stages. The \nfirst (selection) stage involves a decision about whether a particular potential state qualifies \nfor a multilateral PKO. Although many inter- and intra-state conflicts, both actual and \npotential, have existed over the post-Cold War period, only a small share of these have led \nto a multilateral PKO (Dodds, 2005, Fortna, 2004a, Mullenbach, 2005). The second \n(participation) stage \u2013 as in our main estimations \u2013 centres on the decision to provide troops \nto a particular PKO. We model both stages together using Heckman\u2019s two-stage probit \nestimator. This works by first estimating the selection stage, and then the participation stage \nfor all PKOs, allowing the error terms of the two regression stages to be correlated with \neach other. In the first stage, the unit of analysis is the country year. Up to 154 developing \ncountries are included in this stage (note, we exclude developed countries here, since none \nof them has either hosted a PKO or is likely to do so in the future). Over the period 1990-\n2005, multilateral PKOs \u2013 orchestrated under the UN, regional IGOs and \u201ccoalitions of the \nwilling\u201d \u2013 were held in 26 of these developing countries.  \n The sample, dependent and explanatory variables are the same in the second stage \nof this model as they were in our main estimations above. The dependent variable in the \nfirst stage of estimation is a dummy variable that is set to one if a peacekeeping operation \nhas been in place in the potential recipient state in a particular year. Seven selection \n 27 \nvariables are included in the first stage. The first is a measure of conflict intensity which \nhas been found to positively influence the likelihood of a multilateral PKO (Fortna, 2004a, \nGilligan and Stedman, 2003). Our specific variable, derived from Lacina and Gleditsch \n(2005), is the number of conflict deaths over the past five years. Along similar lines, we \ninclude a variable measuring the number of refugees relative to population size, based on \ndata from UNHCR (various years). Again, we expect that PKOs are more likely to be \nestablished where conflicts are accompanied by a larger number of refugees, not least \nbecause of heightened self-interest motives. After Mullenbach (2005), who finds that \nceasefire agreements increase the likelihood of a multilateral PKO, we include a dummy \nvariable to denote where there is a ceasefire treaty between belligerents (using data from \nFortna, 2004b). IGOs and ad hoc coalitions are more likely to be willing to orchestrate an \noperation where belligerents in the candidate state have signalled their commitment to \nabide by the rules of the international \u201csociety of states\u201d by agreeing to a cessation of \narmed violence. We also include regional dummies to capture the geographic region in \nwhich a particular country is located. The underlying idea, which receives a degree of \nempirical support in the statistical literature (Gilligan and Stedman, 2003), is that conflicts \nin some regions are more likely to be selected for a multilateral PKO than others. Coding \ndata for regional location is again derived from World Bank (2006). A fifth variable is a \ndummy indicating whether a country is an ex-colony or former Soviet republic which we \nanticipate to raise the likelihood of a PKO taking place. A resource abundance metric seeks \nto control for selection effects arising from the alleged heightened willingness of countries \nto actively intervene in resource-rich countries (Klare, 2005). We use the World Bank\u2019s \n(2006) measure of energy and mineral rents relative to a country\u2019s gross national income. \n 28 \nOur final variable is democratic polity which we include to take account of the possibility \nthat democracies are more likely to grant consent for intervention by multilateral \npeacekeeping forces than autocracies. Democratic polity is again proxied using the Polity \nIV Project\u2019s polity2 indicator (Marshall et al., 2006). The variable is only coded for \ncountries with populations of over 500,000, and furthermore, does not provide a measure of \ndemocracy for states occupied by a foreign nation, whose political system is in transition or \nis highly disrupted by armed conflict (Pl\u00fcmper and Neumayer 2007). As a result, the \ninclusion of the democratic polity variable leads to the loss of a substantial number of \nobservations, and we therefore report two sets of estimations: one with and one without \ndemocracy in the first stage. \n Table 2 shows results. As concerns the first-stage, estimated coefficients for \nvariables measuring international refugees, battle deaths and ceasefire treaty are statistically \nsignificant with the anticipated (positive) sign. We find evidence for an increasing trend \ntoward multinational PKOs over time. We also find a regional selection effect, with South \nAsia and Latin America less likely to receive a PKO than sub-Saharan Africa, the omitted \nreference category in our estimations. Yet neither colony nor natural resource rents emerge \nas statistically significant predictors of PKOs. If democracy in the location country is added \nto the analysis in the second column of table 1, then results hardly change for the other \nvariables, despite losing approximately 20 per cent of the observations. More democratic \ncountries are not statistically significantly more likely to receive international peacekeeping \nthan more autocratic ones, but the expected positive coefficient is only marginally \ninsignificant. \n 29 \nFor the estimations in columns 1 and 4, the Wald test of independent equations \nsignals that the two stages are not independent from each other, suggesting that the \nHeckman\u2019s two-stage probit estimator is appropriate. For the estimations in columns 2 and \n3, the Wald test suggests that modelling both stages simultaneously is not strictly speaking \nnecessary. Even where the Heckman model seems appropriate, as in columns 1 and 4, the \nsecond-stage estimation results are very similar to our main estimation results. We can \ntherefore be confident that our results are not tainted by a potential non-random sample \nselection effect. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nPost-Cold War peacekeeping operations (PKOs) are instructive in relation to debates about \nthe changing nature of territorial sovereignty and conditions under which countries are able \nto legitimately exercise extra-territoriality (Agnew, 2005, \u00d3 Tuathail, 2000). Multilateral \noperations also say a great deal about the spatiality of the international \u201csociety of states\u201d \nand, specifically, the distribution of states willing to contribute towards the public goods of \npeace, security and human rights protection (Dodds, 2005; Solomon, 2007). Peacekeeping \nalso reveals something very important about the characteristics of contemporary \ngeopolitical interests, and how these are shaped by domestic and non-domestic attributes \n(Chopra, 1996, Silberfein, 2004).  \nOur contribution in this paper picks-up on the above themes of extra-territoriality, \nmultilateralism and geopolitical interests by examining countries\u2019 geographically uneven \nparticipation in post-Cold War PKOs. We show that countries\u2019 involvement can be \n 30 \nexplained by a number of identifiable geographic attributes. One of these, which accords \nwith theories of domestic politics, is place-based norms, values and practices (Dodds, 2005, \nFlint, 2004, Lebovic, 2004, O'Loughlin and Kolossov, 2002). As in previous work, we \nshow that more democratic countries are more likely to provide troops to PKOs, with levels \nof democracy emerging as one of the most influential determinants governing the \nprobability of country participation (Andersson, 2002, Lebovic, 2004). Yet, advancing on \nprevious studies, we demonstrate a similar positive relationship between domestic respect \nfor human rights and countries\u2019 involvement in multilateral PKOs. Underscoring further the \nrole of domestic factors, the capacity of sovereign entities to project military power (in \nterms of military capacity and national wealth) is also found to positively influence \ncountries\u2019 propensity to provide troops for peacekeeping missions. \nYet the uneven geography of PKOs cannot be understood with reference to internal, \nterritorially-bounded characteristics alone. To focus solely on the domestic attributes of \nplace \u2013 on the assumption that factors inside state boundaries wholly define the context for \ndecisions over troop contributions \u2013 would be to adopt a highly restrictive view of \ngeography. Our results suggest that understanding the geographic distribution of \npeacekeepers requires us to consider the extra-domestic context and, specifically, aspects of \nspatial and (albeit to a lesser extent) relational linkages between potential troop sending and \nreceiving states. \nHighlighting the influence of spatial proximity and location over extra-territoriality, \ntherefore, we show that countries which are physically closer or positioned in the same \nregion as the target of a particular PKO are more likely to provide troops.9 Additionally, we \nfind evidence that regional location provides a \u201ccontext\u201d for strategic comparison, \n 31 \ncooperation and foreign policy action, with states more likely to participate when more of \ntheir regional peers do so. Indeed, in our separate spatial lag estimation, the share of same \nregion states participating emerges as the second most important factor in substantive terms \ntriggering involvement in a particular PKO. Boundary-spanning, relational ties also matter \nbut, somewhat surprisingly, only clearly for one of our four hypothesised variables: \ncolonial ties. Relational proximity via bilateral trade and joint IGO membership fail to \nemerge as statistically significant predictors of participation in our main estimations. The \nshare of the global stock of target state migrants is only statistically significant in our main \nestimations featuring the spatial lag and, even then, only at the 10% level.  \nThese findings are revealing. Trade and joint-IGO membership are two of the \ncornerstones of Kantian peace theories which emphasise the pacifying influence of \neconomic interdependence and international organization. Indeed, the case for suspecting \nrelational ties \u2013 via trade and international organisations \u2013 to influence countries\u2019 \nwillingness to offer troops for PKOs is compelling, with both featuring in popular accounts \nof peacekeeping. Yet it could simply be that these standard components of the Kantian \npeace do not increase countries\u2019 willingness to volunteer troops in the pursuit of peace, \nstability and human freedoms \u2013 a claim which is unlikely to surprise a number of scholars \nwho have struggled to find systematic evidence that bilateral trade and joint IGO \nmembership are a major influence on patterns of inter-state conflict and cooperation \n(Boehmer et al., 2004; Gartzke, 2007; Ward et al., 2007). \nAnother important insight from our work regards the enduring significance of \nhistorical relationships. In our main estimations, colonial ties (between ex-colonial powers \nand their former colonies) have the highest probability of influencing participation, \n 32 \nindicating that historically-derived ties carry particular weight in the decision by countries \nto provide troops to a PKO. The result is even the more striking given that two other \ninterest-based, relational, variables which might plausibly be correlated with colonialism, \ni.e. bilateral trade and migrant share, do not consistently emerge as statistically significant \npredictors of participation (Eichengreen and Douglas, 1996; Moore and Shellman, 2007). \nThe apparently (largely) independent influence of colonial ties raises interesting questions \nabout the motives for peacekeeping and the underlying reasons for extra-territorial \ninterventions.  \nAt the same time, our findings serve as an important reminder of the ongoing \nimportance of more orthodox, locational foundations of geopolitical behaviour (Chang et \nal., 2004; Tir and Diehl, 2002; Ward et al., 2007). Although receiving comparatively little \nattention in the peacekeeping literature, countries\u2019 relative position in physical space would \nappear to shape the incentives and constraints to extra-territoriality, and their willingness to \noffer troops for peacekeeping. Despite the unprecedented global reach of today\u2019s armed \nforces, physical distance and location continue to matter, a conclusion which should serve \nas a useful corrective to explanations of geopolitical behaviour which focus solely on \ntransnational linkages at the truly global scale. \nAs is the case with similar large-N, inferential studies, it is not possible to draw \ndefinitive insights about why certain statistical correlates identified in the present paper \ninfluence countries\u2019 participation, although they do hint at a range of motives. Our findings \nfor democracy and human rights suggest a role for liberal motives (Andersson, 2002, \nLebovic, 2004, Lyons, 1998, O'Loughlin and Kolossov, 2002). That is, it may well be that \ndomestically-embedded values, norms and practices which are aligned with liberal goals of \n 33 \npeacekeeping underpin a rescaling of the national interest, and a stretching of state \nresponsibility to protect (Dodds, 2000, O'Loughlin and Kolossov, 2002, \u00d3 Tuathail, 2000). \nSimilar motives may similarly explain \u2013 to a greater or lesser extent \u2013 the influence of \ncolonial ties. Against a backdrop of heightened expectations and changed norms of \nappropriateness regarding the role of ex-colonial powers as \u201cguardians\u201d of their ex-\ncolonies, the former may have intervened during the post-Cold War period out of normative \nobligations to do \u201cthe right thing.\u201d \nYet, whilst hinting at liberal impulses, we cannot discount the possibility that more \ndirectly materialist, self-help motives might also have shaped the geography of willing \npeacekeepers. Another possible explanation for our colonialism result is that former \ncolonial powers have sent troops to PKOs located in their former colonies in order to \nmaintain their geopolitical sphere of influence. Moreover, the importance of various aspects \nspatial proximity \u2013 which is likely to be underpinned by self-help concerns about the \nnegative spillovers of conflict and pressure from regional peers \u2013 is difficult to square with \nthe idea that peacekeeping is a wholly altruistic activity, whereby countries endeavour to \nunselfishly serve the wider interests of humanity at the global level.  \n 34 \nREFERENCES \n \nAgnew, J.

Indeed, the \nneed for legitimacy largely arises because it is in the self-interest of states to secure \napproval for extra-territoriality. \n3\n Note, our multivariate research design allows us to control for these distance effects. \n4\n Note, we do not include military observer contributions within this definition. \n5\n Denote the potential troop sending country of interest as i, all other potential troop \nsending countries as -i and the country in which the PKO is located as j, then this variable \ncaptures the spatial effect emanating from countries -i on the troop sending decision of \ncountry i with respect to countries j, where the binary weighting matrix is set to one if \ncountry i and countries \u2013i are located in the same region, and zero otherwise. This amounts \nto what Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper (2008) call source contagion. \n6\n http:\/\/www.correlatesofwar.org\/ \n7\n Using probit or rare events logit instead leads to substantially almost identical results. \n8\n Note, our spatial lag results are robust to using an instrumental variable probit estimation \nto control for the simultaneity bias introduced by the spatial lag (a country\u2019s decision to \nintervene in a specific mission located in a specific country is affected by the sending \npropensity of other countries located in the same region, but also affects this regional \nsending propensity). We use as an instrument the proportion of countries of the sending \ncountry\u2019s region that have sent peacekeeping troops in a specific year to all PKOs, not just \nthe specific mission under consideration. This instrument is far less subject to simultaneity \n 46 \nbias as there are many operations in any one year, not just the specific mission under \nconsideration. \n9  As noted earlier, the inclusion of a spatial lag variable to capture these dynamics renders \nthe same region variable statistically insignificant. \n \n \n"}
