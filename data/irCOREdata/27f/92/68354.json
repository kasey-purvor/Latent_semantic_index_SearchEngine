This paper describes an empirical study of the ways\nin which risk was realised and managed in a day hospital for older people. An\nethnographic approach, with participant observation and semi-structured\ninterviews, and discourse analysis were used to explore these issues with the\nstaff and fifteen users. Whilst the service providers were orientated to the\nmanagement of physical risk, as through the regimes for administering\nmedication and their attention to risk reduction in the physical environment,\nthe service users were more concerned with the risk to their personal and social\nidentities, and they more frequently described its manifestations in inter-\npersonal exchanges, sometimes as infantalisation and stereotyping. The paper\ndevelops this understanding of the potential for falls among older people to\nelucidate a broader interpretation of risk, and reveals that it is commonly\nconstructed as a challenge to a person\u2019s self-image and identity. Such\nconstructions help to explain older people\u2019s responses to complex health\nproblems and to the services and treatments that attempt to solve them.\nKEY WORDS \u2013 falls, falling, risk, discourse analysis, ethnography, social\nidentities.\nIntroduction\nRisk is prominent in explanations of health and illness (Gabe 1995 ;\nPetersen and Lupton 1996). Skolbekken (1995), for example, has\ndescribed a recent \u2018epidemic\u2019 of research papers that explore risk in\nmedical journals. With a few exceptions (e.g. Bellaby 1990 ; Davison et\nal. 1991 ; Parsons and Atkinson 1992), these studies have neglected the\n* School of Health Professions and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of\nSouthampton.\n\u008b Trent Palliative Care Centre, University of Sheffield.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n306 Claire Ballinger and Sheila Payne\nsocial context and the conceptual construction of risk, and instead focus\non the personal characteristics, behaviour and the environmental\nattributes which predispose individuals to ill health. Using the example\nof falls by older people, this paper will argue that a broader conception\nof risk can make a significant contribution to the understanding of\ncomplex health issues.\nThe paper begins with brief reviews of the literature on both health\nrisks and falling among older people. Professional behaviour and codes\nof conduct are also addressed. It then describes an empirical study\nwhich explored the constructions of risk of service providers and users\nat a day hospital for older people. The ethnographic methods and the\nfindings of the discourse analysis are then described, and the discussion\nexplores the ways in which alternative constructions of risk, that feature\nthe social milieu in which behaviours and inter-personal interactions\noccur, help to challenge conventional representations of health prob-\nlems such as falls.\nRisk and health\nThe complex nature of risk becomes immediately apparent when one\nconsiders a definition. Most dictionary definitions allude to the negative\nor undesirable nature of risk, as in the following:\nnoun : hazard, danger, chance of loss, failure or injury; the degree of probability\nof loss ; a person, thing or factor likely to cause loss or danger. verb transitive:\nto expose to risk ; to incur the chance of unfortunate consequences, loss or\ndanger by (doing something) (Schwartz 1992 ; 935).\nThese associations are relatively recent. As Green (1997) points out, in\nthe past risk was as frequently associated with both good and bad\noutcomes and more synonymous with chance. In her article on the\n\u2018 sociology of social research\u2019, Blaxter (1999) comments on the high\nfrequency with which risk was associated with health outcomes in the\nproposals submitted to the British Economic and Social Research Council\nprogramme, \u2018Risk and human behaviour\u2019. She argues that the\npreoccupation with predominantly physical and individual outcomes\nlimits what is viewed as both \u2018risky\u2019 and \u2018at risk \u2019.\nThe conventional view of risk (Tansey and O\u2019Riordan 1999) is\nactuarial, with the risk assessment seen as a skilled professional and\ntechnical task which is the preserve of experts (Gabe 1995). In\nmedicine and health, the disciplines most closely associated with the\nestimation of risk are epidemiology and public health, and the methods\nof choice include large randomised controlled trials, population\ndatabases and advanced statistical analysis (Petersen and Lupton\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe construction of the risk of falling among and by older people 307\n1996). Another strand of risk research in health is its exploration in the\nsocial context. Writing in this field is dominated by Beck (e.g. 1992) and\nGiddens (e.g. 1991), who argue that the preoccupation with risk is a\ndistinctvely modern phenomenon, brought about by the erosion of\nsocial structures which once provided stability and security, such as the\nfamily and the state. Their work elucidates the intricate links between\nsocial forms and the level of orientation to risk, the type of risks that are\ndescribed, and the extent to which they are perceived to pose a threat.\nScott and Freeman (1995) illustrate these connections through the\nspecific example of HIV and AIDs.\nThe psychological approach to risk in health focuses on the\nrelationship of individual characteristics and behaviours to health\noutcomes, the territory of the rapidly expanding sub-discipline of\nhealth psychology. Much of this is based on models which explain and\npredict health behaviour, such as the \u2018health belief model \u2019. In such\nmodels, the individual is characterised as a conscious and rational\nactor, making decisions on the basis of perceived vulnerability, risk and\npredictable outcomes (Lupton 1999).\nAnother and neglected theoretical approach to risk is the sociocul-\ntural perspective as advanced by the anthropologist Mary Douglas.\nHer major contribution to the study and understanding of risk is the\nassertion that the identification and privileging of particular risks\nabove others is dependent on the cultural context in which they are\nlocated. The ways in which these risks are responded to are dependent\non cultural explanations about danger and \u2018otherness \u2019. The \u2018grid-\ngroup\u2019 model of cultural explanations of risk advanced by Douglas and\nWildavsky (1982) has been used by Bellaby (1990) to explore health\nand safety at work.\nThe identification of and protection from risk are often explicitly\naddressed in professional codes of conduct such as that issued by the\nUnited Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting\n(UKCC) (UKCC 1992). Hussey (1996) has identified some of the\nproblems inherent in too rigid an interpretation of professional codes of\nconduct, and highlights a broad range of functions which such codes\ncan serve, including guidance, information, proclamation and nego-\ntiation. He argues that professionals need the skills and ability to\nbecome \u2018enhanced moral agents \u2019 (Hussey 1996 : 251), and that codes\nof conduct should aim to assist complex decision making, rather than\nbeing interpreted as sets of prescriptive rules. The different theoretical\napproaches to the consideration of health risk that have been described,\nand a review of health professionals\u2019 codes of conduct, have provided\nthe conceptual framework for our empirical study. The next section\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n308 Claire Ballinger and Sheila Payne\nintroduces falls as a problem of older age, and summarises the\npertinent literature.\nFalling as a health problem of older age\nFalling in older age has become an important issue for the health care\nservices in many developed countries. In the United Kingdom (UK),\nit is estimated that around 30 per cent of older people living in the\ncommunity aged 65 years and over fall each year (Campbell et al.\n1981), rising to around 40 per cent in those over 75 years (Downton\nand Andrews 1991). The physical consequences of falling have been\nwell documented. It is estimated that over 1,500 people aged 65 and\nover die each year in the UK as a result of a fall at home (Department\nof Trade and Industry 1998). One of the well publicised consequences\nof a fall is hip fracture, shown to occur in around 1 per cent of older\npeople who live in the community who fall. Other physical trauma\nresulting from falls include fractures to other bones, and soft tissue\ninjury (Gryfe et al. 1977 ; Tinetti et al. 1988).\nIn response to the perceived problem of falling in older age, falls have\nfeatured regularly in health policy, research programmes and health\npromotion campaigns initiated by successive British governments.\nTargets for reductions in number of falls and accidents experienced by\nolder people were present in both the 1992 and 1999 health White\nPapers (Department of Health 1992 ; 1999), and were also included in\nthe recent National Service Framework for Older People (Department of\nHealth 2001). Interventions to prevent falling in older people have\nbeen the focus of an \u2018Effective Health Care Bulletin\u2019 (Nuffield Institute\nfor Health and NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination 1996) and\na Cochrane Review (Gillespie et al. 1998), both of which were\ninitiatives to improve the evidence base that underpins health services\nin the UK. Many dedicated falls prevention services have also been\ndeveloped in response to this perceived health threat.\nThe governments of many other countries have responded to the\nchallenge of falling in their older populations with research and\npractice initiatives. In the United States, for example, a major\nprogramme of research known as the \u2018Frailty, and Injuries : Co-\noperative Studies of Intervention Techniques \u2019 (FICSIT) programme\nwas funded throughout the later 1990s, the objective being a meta-\nanalysis of seven different falls prevention programmes (Ory et al.\n1993). In Australia, falling also features prominently in both health\nresearch (e.g. Lord et al. 2001) and clinical practice (e.g. Clemson et al.\n1999 ; Hill et al. 1994).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe construction of the risk of falling among and by older people 309\nA consistent theme of the reviews of this emerging research field is the\nneglect of psychological and social factors in the aetiology of falls (e.g.\nAskham et al. 1990 ; Lilley et al. 1995). They also identify inconsistency\nin both the definition of a fall and in the methods of reporting, which\ninclude older people\u2019s self reports through diaries and postcards, carers\u2019\nobservations, and institutional incident books. Variable reports of\nincidence have generated inappropriate explanations, as with \u2018 the\nnotorious forgetfulness of the elderly \u2019 (Gryfe et al. 1977 : 207).\nThroughout, the dominant perspective is a positivist construction of an\nobjective event, the occurrence of which many older people may not\nrecognise or may deny. This encourages investigators to \u2018blame the\nvictim\u2019 for any differences between the anticipated and the reported\nincidence, when it is actually a consequence of their own methodological\ninadequacies.\nAlthough not a major theme in the literature, some studies have\ntaken older peoples\u2019 experiences of a fall and of a (closely associated)\nhip fracture as a topic worthy of investigation in its own right. Borkan\net al. (1991) interviewed 80 older people admitted to hospital with hip\nfracture and gathered the subjects\u2019 own narratives of the event. They\nfound that different explanatory models were employed by older\npeople to account for their falls, namely the body as machine (which\nmight break down), and the body as an organic structure (prone to\nillness or disease). Additional analysis suggested that those who\ndescribed their hip fracture in a mechanistic fashion or by reference to\nexternal agency achieved better ambulation outcomes at three and six\nmonths post-fracture. This suggests that differences in people\u2019s\nnarratives are both grounded and may be related to the success of\nrehabilitation.\nThe dissociation of the self from the likelihood of falling was observed\nby Braun (1998) from a survey of older people living in residential\naccommodation in the United States. The respondents were more\nlikely to identify other people as at risk of a fall than themselves. This\nsuggests that rather than the risk being independent of the person (or\nneutral for affect), individuals are strongly motivated to underplay\ntheir personal susceptibility. Braun\u2019s work also draws attention to the\ndifferent ways in which health professionals and older people view and\nrepresent falling. Such differences were explicitly investigated using a\nsocial constructionist framework by Martin (1999). This work\nsuggested that falling is an emotive and loaded topic, and that the\nlanguage used to describe falls by older people avoids connotations of\npersonal vulnerability. Martin (1999) also found cultural variations in\nthe description of falls.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n310 Claire Ballinger and Sheila Payne\nThe study of health professionals\u2019 and lay perspectives of falls\nTo investigate these issues further, the authors\u2019 first study examined the\nways in which health professionals and older people who had fallen\nrepresented falling. A full account is found in Ballinger and Payne\n(2000). Over nine weeks in 1997, eight people with fractured hips aged\n65 years and over were recruited from an orthopaedic trauma elderly\ncare ward of a large general hospital in the south of England. In\naddition, 20 occupational therapists and physiotherapists were recruit-\ned from two local NHS trusts. The data were generated through semi-\nstructured interviews with questions that focused on the reasons for, the\npredictability of, and the consequences of falls. The therapists\nconstructed a fall as a predictable event which health professionals had\na duty to try and prevent, and they identified many personal charac-\nteristics of older people that they believed were implicated in the\ncauses, including physical problems, cognitive deficits such as senility\nand confusion, \u2018neurological events \u2019, \u2018blood pressure problems\u2019, and\npersonal habits and behaviour, such as wearing inappropriate shoes.\nThe home environment was also mentioned many times. The\noccupational therapists and physiotherapists represented themselves as\nknowledgeable experts whose role it was to teach their older patients\nand clients how to remain safe.\nIn contrast, the responses of the older service users focused on their\ncommendable personal attributes, and many refuted negative assess-\nments of their mental state, moral characters, and capacity to take care\nof themselves. With respect to the perceived reasons for the fall which\ncaused their hospital admission, the older people were reluctant to\nassume responsibility for the event, and some attributed their accident\nto the carelessness of other people. Many spontaneously affirmed that\nthey had not been drinking at the time of the fall. The two sets of\ninterviews clearly established differences in the perspectives of health\nprofessionals and older people on not only the vulnerability to falls but\nalso the consequences and preventative strategies. This initial study\nprovided an impetus and direction for the research reported here,\nwhich has examined a broader range of perceptions of risk.\nRepresentations of risk in a day hospital for older people\nThe introductory sections have established that although alternative\nframeworks for understanding risk have been proposed, in health\nresearch a positivist perspective has predominated, and research has\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe construction of the risk of falling among and by older people 311\nneglected its psychological and social aspects. Nonetheless a few studies\nhave shown that falling might be an emotive issue for older people, and\nsuggested that there are differences in the ways that it is represented by\nhealth professionals and by those who have experienced a fall. We now\ndiscuss the merits of the methodology that was selected to investigate\nthese variations and broader dimensions of the risk of falling.\nDiscourse analysis as the underpinning methodology\n\u2018Discourse analysis \u2019 is used in many academic disciplines, but this\nstudy borrows most closely from the methodologies developed in British\nsocial psychology (Nikander 1995). This form is particularly ap-\npropriate for this study because of the action orientation in its approach\nto talk and texts, in contrast to the orientation in other disciplines\ntowards beliefs, attitudes and the identification of facts (Potter 1996 ;\nPotter and Wetherell 1987). The attention in discourse analysis to the\nwider resources (or \u2018 interpretative repertoires \u2019, cf. Potter 1996), that\nare employed in the construction of everyday life creates the critical\npotential of the methodology (Parker 1992 ; 1997). It enables us to see\nhow dominant \u2018common sense \u2019 understandings manifest in the\nconstruction of meaning about the social world and, by extension, helps\nus to identify those perspectives which are not represented or are\ndeliberately silenced.\nThe use of discourse analysis as a framework for exploring risk in a\nday hospital for older people therefore had the potential to clarify how\nservice users were viewed, how the purpose of the service was identified,\nand how interactions between service users and providers were framed\nand managed. It also facilitated access to the service users\u2019 perspectives.\nWe selected the following principles to guide the data interpretation:\nE attention to the detail and construction of the text (Potter and Wetherell\n1995)\nE focus on contradictions and disjunctions in texts (Potter and Wetherell\n1995)\nE identifying objects and subjects, and how texts are rhetorically constructed\naround and through them (Parker 1992)\nE examining the ways in which specified institutions and categories of person\nare reinforced or disempowered in texts (Parker 1992)\nThe use of a discourse analytic methodology also focuses attention on\nthe criteria that are employed to determine rigour in the work.\nFollowing other researchers that have used discourse analysis (and\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n312 Claire Ballinger and Sheila Payne\nseveral other \u2018critical \u2019 qualitative research methods), positivist markers\nof quality such as \u2018reliability \u2019 and \u2018validity \u2019 were believed to be\ninappropriate. Instead, we favour the provision of a detailed rationale\nfor the research design, sample construction and methods, and an\nemphasis upon ensuring that a sufficient volume of data is examined\nto achieve \u2018 stability \u2019 in interpretation, reflexivity and plausibility\n(Mason 1996 ; Potter 1996 ; Potter and Wetherell 1994).\nDesign and methods\nAn ethnographic approach using participant observation was adopted\n(Fetterman 1998 ; Hammersley and Atkinson 1995). The benefits of\nthis approach include the study of a naturalistic setting and a flexible\ndesign, which enables the researcher to shift the focus or adopt new\nmethods to investigate emerging topics of interest. Three specific data\ngeneration methods were employed: participant observation, semi-\nstructured interviews, and the analysis of documentary sources.\nParticipant observation was carried out for five weeks, followed by a\ntwo week break and then four weeks further field work, during which\ntime 15 semi-structured interviews were carried out. Field notes were\ngathered for just over 50 hours, of which semi-structured interviews\ncarried out in the day hospital setting took four hours.\nRecent work (e.g. Atkinson and Hammersley 1998) has drawn\nattention to the need to clarify and justify the role of the researcher in\nobservational work, as critical perspectives have criticised the objective\nof ethnographic studies as simply recording \u2018what is there\u2019. For this\nstudy, the first author and researcher, whilst neither a service provider\nnor user in the health facility, actively engaged and interacted with the\npeople she observed. The presence of the researcher inevitably\ninfluenced the \u2018 social action\u2019, and therefore it cannot be claimed that\nnon-participant observation strictly occurred.\nDuring the participant observation, the researcher orientated herself\nas closely as possible with the older service users for several reasons. As\na young health professional, she expected to identify more easily with\nthose providing the service than those receiving it ; and having a health\nprofessional background, there may be a tendency to explain structure\nand action in a health facility in service provider terms. She therefore\ndeliberately avoided accessing large amounts of formal or written\ninformation about the day hospital before the study began, and\npurposefully avoided collecting \u2018medical \u2019 data about the participants\n(e.g. diagnosis) or accessing their medical records. For most of the\nobservational periods, she placed herself in the central day room where\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe construction of the risk of falling among and by older people 313\nservice users were for most of the day. She introduced herself as a\nstudent to both service users and providers, and dressed informally.\nThe peripheral treatment rooms (such as the physiotherapy room)\nwere entered only in the company of and with permission from the\nservice users with whom she was interacting.\nThe fifteen interviews with service users were carried out during the\nlast four weeks of observation. Of the fifteen participants, five were\nmale and ten female, and the age range was from 66 to 89 years\n(median 77 years). Participants were given a choice of venue for the\ninterview: four chose the day hospital, and eleven their homes. The\ninterview questions focused on the reasons for attending the day\nhospital, activity there, the participants\u2019 views and concerns (if any)\nabout growing older and whether the day hospital addressed these, and\na specific question about falling. Information about recruitment\nprocedure is included in \u2018Sample\u2019 below.\nSome analysis of documentary sources was also carried out, including\nthe \u2018Service Profile \u2019 and \u2018Operational Policy\u2019 of the day hospital, an\ninformation booklet about the day hospital prepared for new service\nusers, and the information leaflets and health promotion posters\ndisplayed on the walls. Some of these texts were freely available to\nservice users, and others were requested from staff. Ethical approval\nwas obtained from the joint local research ethics committee, and\npermission to collect data in the day hospital was sought from the\nmanager and, at her suggestion, from the staff group. A condition of\nethical approval being awarded was that the medical consultant\nproviding medical cover also gave his permission.\nSample\nSelecting the users of a day hospital permitted access to older people\nwho had regular contact with health professionals and were still living\nat home. Service users of such facilities are therefore usually more\nindependent and have better health than those in hospital, although\nhave some health care needs, such as functional assessment, rehabili-\ntation, or physical maintenance (Corner et al. 1998). Day hospitals\nmay be viewed as providing a service to older people at the\nmargins of the health care spectrum, and their users may be\nexperiencing a transition in health status. Such a setting may be more\napposite to a study of the constructions of risk than, for example, an\nacute hospital in which there may be more of a consensus about risk\nstatus and management.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n314 Claire Ballinger and Sheila Payne\nThe day hospital was located in the grounds of a large hospital for\nelderly people, and a newly established service called a \u2018Fallers clinic \u2019\nprovided rapid response multi-disciplinary assessment and treatment\nfor older people who had experienced a fall. This clinic was however a\nseparate service with dedicated staff time, and whilst the service users\ncould be cross-referred, few of the day hospital attenders were aware of\nthe clinic\u2019s existence. The day hospital was in a single storey building,\nwith a day room and patio at the centre. Surrounding this central area\nwere individual treatment rooms, toilets, staff offices, kitchen and a\ndining room. The clinical team in the day hospital included doctors,\nnurses and therapists. Service users were accepted if they were aged 65\nor more years and required medical, therapy or rehabilitative nursing\nassessment or treatment ; and they generally attended for either two or\nthree days per week.\nThe names of possible participants were obtained from the daily lists\nof attenders. The recruitment procedure required that the service users\nwere first provided with verbal and written information about the\nstudy, and approached at a later time with the invitation to participate.\nOf the 60 names on the lists over three weeks, 22 could not be\napproached a second time, e.g. because they only attended once during\nthe recruitment period, 16 declined to participate, and seven could not\nbe identified. Written consent was gained immediately prior to the\ninterview and confidentiality promised to participants.\nData analysis\nThe tape-recorded interviews were transcribed immediately after they\ntook place, along with notes of the researcher\u2019s thoughts and\nimpressions. The data from the first five weeks\u2019 observation sessions\nwere entered into the \u2018Ethnograph\u2019 qualitative data analysis soft-\nware package. The initial coding scheme was then developed, and\nthe refinement prcoedures began. Later observation and interview\ndata were subsequently analysed using the refined coding system.\nThe coded texts were repeatedly re-read to develop the theoretical\nframework, while the documentary sources were filed throughout\nthe period of analysis and contributed to the emerging interpretation.\nThis process was facilitated by the production of iterative accounts,\nfurther literature searches, and the preparation and discussion of\ninterim reports.\"\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe construction of the risk of falling among and by older people 315\nFindings\nService providers\u2019 orientation to physical risk\nThe service providers\u2019 discourse focused on physical safety and the well\nbeing of the older people who attended the day hospital. On initial\nreferral to both the day hospital and the fallers\u2019 clinic, the users were\ngiven a thorough physical examination by a physician, which involved\nthe removal of outer clothes and lengthy and systematic testing of the\nvarious systems of the body. As a new patient commented about her\ninitial interaction with the doctor on her first day at the facility, \u2018There\nwas not a part of my body that wasn\u2019t asked about\u2019. The assessment\nrole of the nurse was emphasised and formalised in the information\nbooklet provided to new attenders with the following description:\nA nurse will be involved with specific nursing care such as well-person checks,\nmonitoring of blood pressure, management of continence, and monitoring of\nmedication.\nThe overall aim of the day hospital was described in the \u2018Operational\npolicy\u2019 as to \u2018promote independent living and good health\u2019. However,\nthe initial experience of service users attending the day hospital was of\npassive examination aimed at detecting physical malfunction.\nThe architecture and design of the day hospital ensured that service\nusers were easily visible to staff. The large day room could be seen\nthrough glass panels which ran from waist height to ceiling in the\ncorridor leading to the main entrance and exit. Staff offices and\ntreatment rooms were situated peripherally, and so staff approaching\nthe day room had a clear view of the service user group. The two\nclerical staff worked in an office beside the main entrance, and so could\ngreet people as they arrived, but also check on those who were leaving.\nThe design of the day hospital therefore also enabled easy observation\nof the patient group, and detection of risks and untoward events such\nas a fall, the entry of an unauthorised person into the building, or a\nconfused individual wandering. Other rules and practices were\ndesigned to reduce physical risk. The day room and main passageways\nwere kept free of obstacles, and larger mobility aids such as walking\nframes were stored away from thoroughfares. At least one member of\nstaff was normally present in the day room at any time, and at those\ntimes when the users were required to move to another area, as at\nlunchtime, other members of staff would collect mobility aids and\nwheelchairs and escort the attenders to the dining room. Once seated,\nthey were served their meals by the staff.\nThrough the study period, the incidence of accidents was low, for\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n316 Claire Ballinger and Sheila Payne\nexample, no falls were observed. The diligent management of risk had\nhowever other consequences which seemed at odds with the promotion\nof independence, one of the primary objectives of this service. Service\nusers who required a mobility aid to walk had to request help from a\nmember of staff to fetch their aid, as when they wanted to use the\nlavatory. With a few exceptions, the service users, particularly if new,\nwere discouraged from \u2018wandering around\u2019. On one occasion, an older\nwoman who had recently begun to attend was uncertain whether she\nwas \u2018allowed\u2019 to use the bathroom unless invited to do so. The teaching\nof specific mobility techniques, and practice of the techniques, occurred\nduring the treatment sessions by the physiotherapists, usually in the\nphysiotherapy treatment room and surrounding corridor. But the focus\non physical risk meant that the skills learnt during these sessions were\ngenerally not reinforced or practised in the day hospital without\nsupervision, which was usually provided at specified times. On very few\noccasions were the service users encouraged to initiate action, for\nexample, to make a cup of tea or coffee or to prepare their own lunch.\nAnother illustration of the negative consequences of the primary\nrequirement for physical safety was the approach to medication\nadministration. On arrival in the morning, the users were required to\nhand their tablets to one of the nursing staff who locked all medication\naway. At regular intervals during the day, a registered nurse would\ncarry out a drug round in which medication would be dispensed,\nostensibly to reduce the likelihood of mistakes. Many of the service\nusers were however responsible for taking their own tablets when at\nhome. One participant, Amy, commented extensively on day hospital\npractice during the course of the interview. She elected to be\ninterviewed at home, and said that the way in which the staff assumed\ncontrol of her medication was one of several reasons why she disliked\nattending. To her, this procedure meant that service users were treated\n\u2018 like children, you know\u2019. She also raised other objections :\nbut code, codeine, I took those to take for my arm \u2026 ah for the pain in my\narm, one, two, every four hours \u2026 and half the time they didn\u2019t bring them\nround or anything or ask you if you want it.\nHer comment illustrates the awareness and sensitivity of some service\nusers to the social implications of the routines in the day hospital. For\nAmy, the medication routine resulted in both humiliation and an\ninflexible practice that denied her access to relief from pain.\nService provision in the day hospital also appeared to prioritise\nbiological function, and risk was therefore recognised as the agents or\nevents that threatened physical harm, such as a fall or a medication\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe construction of the risk of falling among and by older people 317\noverdose. This risk was managed by the imposition of rules and\nroutines, such as the list of people with diabetes in the kitchen, and\nat mealtimes by serving specially prepared \u2018diabetic meals \u2019 to this\ngroup before the others.\nThe service users\u2019 perception of challenges to self and identity\nThe services users\u2019 conversations, their comments during the interviews,\nand our observations of them suggested that they orientated to the\nsocial nature of the day hospital. In reflecting on her own positive\nexperience of the day hospital, for example, Ella said:\nthe social side er er helps very much, as I said about talking to other\npeople \u2026 meeting other people and seeing people that are worse off than\nyou \u2026 and you see some people er come in and you think to yourself, \u2018Oh my\nGod and here\u2019s me moaning about mine\u2019, you know, and and they\u2019re they\u2019re\nmuch worse off so it does help to er bring you back into perspective.\nFrom the participant observer\u2019s perspective, many implicit rules of\nsocial behaviour appeared to govern interaction in the day room. The\nseat that a service user occupied for much of the day, for example,\nappeared to be determined both by gender and the accumulated\nduration of attendances. An area termed the \u2018main circle \u2019 was almost\nexclusively occupied by women who had been attending for a relatively\nlong time and who initiated most of the conversation and laughter.\nGroup activities, such as the board games organised by a volunteer,\ntended to be oriented towards this group, the board being placed in\ntheir clear view but less visible from other areas of the day room. The\n\u2018back row\u2019 was used in contrast by people who preferred less interaction\nor who were new attenders to the service.\nThe users\u2019 orientation to social behaviour enabled them to perceive\nother manifestations of risk. May, newly referred to the day hospital,\nduring a period of participant observation described the other women\nin the main circle as \u2018a cackling load of old devils \u2019, and implied that she\nhad \u2018put her foot in it \u2019 with them (Visit 12). She later revealed that\nduring the previous week she had been seen talking with a male service\nuser who had become emotional and upset. In response, she had placed\nher hand upon his arm to comfort him. May felt that this action had\nbeen interpreted as \u2018 familiar \u2019 by some of the other women service users,\nand had upset and annoyed them. Ignorance of the social code in the\nnovel situation constituted a risk, of behaving in an inappropriate or\nsocially unacceptable way.\nThe role of staff and others with authority to determine appropriate\nsocial behaviour was evident in some of the service users\u2019 accounts. In\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n318 Claire Ballinger and Sheila Payne\nthe following excerpt, Irene, whose daughter was a health professional,\ncomments negatively about the actions of a fellow patient who acted\nagainst the advice of the senior nurse. Her account invokes shared\nsocial judgements about what constitutes \u2018good\u2019 patient behaviour (i.e.\nthat one is compliant) through use of such terms as, \u2018wouldn\u2019t do a\nthing she was told\u2019, and \u2018deliberately got out \u2019, and in the details of the\ndisastrous consequences when one \u2018misbehaves \u2019 :\nand yet you get another one who wouldn\u2019t do a thing she was told \u2026 one fell\nbecause she was told not to get out of the chair on her own and she deliberately\ngot out \u2026 she fell \u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2019.\nDuring the interviews, some participants alluded to the broader social\nrisks in the wider community of being perceived as disabled. Pat (P) is\nthe service user in the following extract, who was interviewed with her\npartner, Colin (C):\nP: \u2026 and I think I mean \u2026 using a wheelchair, I wouldn\u2019t like to do that in\ncase\nC: Ah, she feels sort of embarrassed doing that you know\nP: In case I meet a friend.\nAs a service user, to be in attendance at a facility providing health\nservices specifically for older people requiring rehabilitation created\nrisks to personal identities that were valued and synonymous with\nindependence and a general capability in society. Michael powerfully\nreflected on this during the course of an interview:\nYou know sometimes in the afternoon they\u2019d all fall asleep [and] I thought,\nMy God, [I never] thought it\u2019d [n]ever come to this. I\u2019d look round the\nroom and see old people propped up in the same sort of chairs all saying very\nlittle, all the men too and all the women too. One or two would be there and\ntheir heads would fall back and their mouths would open with a vacant look\non their faces.\nSandra, who was in her sixties and had experienced a stroke, when\nspeaking about the day hospital staff, distinguished herself from \u2018the\nolder people \u2019 in the day hospital, apparently to distance herself from\nthe negative stereotype of the service user :\nAnd um, well, they seem to be rather nice to people individually you know\nthey sort of don\u2019t mind a joke and that sort of thing it\u2019s really it\u2019s very helpful\nto the older people I feel \u2026 and it, you know, they\u2019re, they\u2019re in a safe\nenvironment just for a few hours before they go back to to their homes or\nwherever they\u2019re going.\nThese examples suggest that attention to the social milieu of the day\nhospital permits the construction of a broader view of risk in which\npersonal and social identities are implicated. This alternative view may\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe construction of the risk of falling among and by older people 319\nbetter reflect the day hospital experience of the service user, and also\nillustrates how the identification and management of apparently\n\u2018objective \u2019 risks, such as the possibility of a fall, may inadvertently\ncreate other risks, such as increased dependence and loss of dignity.\nDiscussion\nAcross the range of the health services, Petersen and Lupton (1996)\nhave noted the increase in the influence and visibility of health\npromotion activities. They particularly critique the ideological and\nmoral content of the \u2018new public health\u2019, arguing that health promoters\nand various institutions work together to produce the \u2018at-risk \u2019\nindividual. The management of the constructed \u2018at-risk \u2019 status is\nachieved through the willing participation of the public, who view it as\na duty and moral obligation to participate in the maintenance of their\nown health. It is in such ways that the current enthusiasm for\nidentifying the risk factors for health, with the extension of the influence\nof public health into new spheres such as leisure, diet and sex life, means\nthat the number of \u2018 risky\u2019 individuals and activities, far from\ndecreasing, is growing.\nThe findings of the empirical study illustrate the extension of health\npromotion principles into community services for older people, as with\nthe fallers\u2019 clinic and in many patient information posters and leaflets.\nThe principles of rehabilitation emphasise the responsibility of individ-\nuals to participate actively in their treatment, to hasten a return\nto optimal function (Department of Health 1997 ; McLellan 1997 ;\nRobinson and Turnock 1998). But the service response to the signs of\nphysical risk in the day hospital resulted in an environment in which\npeople were dissuaded from independent activity, and in which normal\ndaily activities such as having meals and drinks were organised and\ndelivered by staff. Service users were sometimes unnecessarily provided\nwith personal help and guidance to carry out daily routines. Ironically,\nthis resulted in a health facility in which some people were less mobile\nand used fewer life skills than in their own homes. The focus on physical\nactivity and risk, and the staff\u2019s role in limiting \u2018 inappropriate \u2019 patient\nbehaviour, reinforced passivity among the service users, and also meant\nthat the potential for psycho-social interventions, for example to\npromote self esteem or confidence, was not recognised and under-\nutilised.\nIt also appears that the increasing focus on the health professional\u2019s\nresponsibility to maintain the safety of service users, partly through the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\n320 Claire Ballinger and Sheila Payne\nrigid interpretation of professional rules of conduct, may also contribute\nto a conservative approach to service provision in which patient-\ninitiated activity is seen as potentially challenging and dangerous.\nAdditionally, service users may not be aware of, or share, a perception\nthat they can be participants in the maintenance of their own health\nand function, and may have different priorities. This latter point is\nreinforced by the apparent orientation of service users to risks of a social\nrather than physical nature, as in the day hospital but also in the wider\ncommunity. This tendency has been exemplified in the expressions of\nthe risk of being ostracised through unexpected or unconventional\nbehaviour, the risk of infantalisation on the part of health professionals,\nand the risk of being stigmatised in one\u2019s local community.\nIt is suggested that the identification of falling as a significant health\nproblem for older people is predicated on positivist perspectives of risk\nthat prioritise the reduction of physical injury or trauma. This positivist\nconstruction of a fall as an objective event, which can be prevented and\nhas identifiable precursors and predictable consequences, is prob-\nlematic for several reasons. Firstly, it isolates the event from its social\ncontext. Ballinger and Payne (2000) suggest that for many older people\nfalling is an emotive topic, and that many are anxious to distance\nthemselves from such events to avoid being negatively stereotyped as\nfrail and vulnerable. Other research evidence suggests that older people\ntend to under-estimate the occurrence of falls, and may be reluctant to\ndisclose their occurrence (Lilley et al. 1995). This has obvious\nimplications for the manner in which the issue of falling is approached\nand discussed with older people. It also suggests that sensitivity is\nrequired when recording falls.\nA second problem with the positivist construction is the neglect of the\ncontingent and negotiated nature of the risks. Green (1997) showed\nthat the meaning of \u2018accident \u2019 has evolved historically, and that lay\nand professional attributions of the causes frequently differ. Par-\nticipation in many health promotion activities, such as falls prevention\nprogrammes, is based on shared assumptions about the causes of\naccidents and how they can be prevented. The common preventive\ninterventions are exercise programmes and modifications of the home\nenvironment. If an older person views a fall as a matter of bad luck,\ndoes not believe that improvements in muscle strength or balance will\nreduce their likelihood, and cannot accept that their home is a risky\nenvironment, they are unlikely to see the advocated preventative\ninterventions as relevant or necessary. Whilst there is scanty in-\nformation about adherence in most of the reports of falls prevention\ntrials, the variation in adherence has been recognised (Shah et al. 1997).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Mar 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe construction of the risk of falling among and by older people 321\nA third issue raised by the reductionist explanation of falls is that\nsome of the proposed measures either to prevent falls or to minimise\ntheir impact create social risks. Participation in falls prevention\ninitiatives means that one is easily identified as an individual with\nproblems. Similar labelling if not stigmatisation occurs with hip\nprotectors, under-garments with soft pads over the proximal ends\nof both femurs that are designed to prevent fractures. Whilst the\nevidence suggests that when worn they do reduce the incidence of\nbroken hips, Green (2000 : 471) reports that many accident prevention\nprofessionals reject the use of what they describe as \u2018padded knickers \u2019\nbecause they compromise the dignity and respect of older clients. Non-\nadherence is recognised as an important influence on the effectiveness\nof hip protectors (Cameron and Quine 1994).\nThe prevalence of and harm caused by falls has led to a plethora of\ninformation leaflets about their prevention, as produced by The Royal\nSociety for the Prevention of Accidents, the Department of Trade and Industry\nand the Health Education Authority, and individual health professionals.\nThe effectiveness of such leaflets is contingent on older people\nrecognising their vulnerability, engaging with the contents, sharing\ntheir assertions about the causes of falls, and having the resources to\nfollow their recommendations. These presumptions remain untested.\nIn conclusion, we argue that health professionals who work in services\nfor older people should consider the adoption of alternative approaches\nthat emphasise opportunity and valued social identities, such as the\n\u2018Five service accomplishments \u2019 model (O\u2019Brien 1987). Whilst ac-\nknowledging the need to be cognisant of risk, we argue that rigid\ndefinitions that are defined purely in physical or functional terms\nproduce services which do not address older people\u2019s concerns and in\nwhich they will be reluctant to participate.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank the service providers and users who generously gave of\ntheir time to participate in this study.
