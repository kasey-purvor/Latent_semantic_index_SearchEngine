That the model over-\nestimated measured [X-ABA]leaf may result from\nchanges in [X-ABA] along the transport pathway or an\nartefact of collecting xylem sap from detached leaves.\nThe implications of declining sap flow through partially\ndry roots during PRD for the control of stomatal\nbehaviour and irrigation scheduling are discussed.\nKey words: ABA, deficit irrigation, grafting, irrigation\nscheduling, modelling, partial rootzone drying, sap flow, soil\nmoisture heterogeneity.\nIntroduction\nSoil moisture is commonly heterogeneously distributed\nwithin the soil profile, with greater root proliferation in the\nupper surface layers causing localized soil drying while\ndecreased root length density at depth results in compar-\natively moist subsurface layers (Sharp and Davies, 1985).\nAlthough soil moisture sensors distributed throughout the\nsoil profile can monitor water uptake from (and thus\nestimate sap flow through) roots of different layers (Gu\net al., 2004; Leib et al., 2006), the vertical distribution of\nwater uptake will depend on both soil moisture status and\nroot length density. Determining the influence of soil\ndrying per se on water uptake, independent of the\ninfluence of root length density, can conveniently be\nassessed using a split-root plant (Blackman and Davies,\n1985), and also provides a good model system to assess\nthe efficacy of different deficit irrigation techniques.\n* To whom correspondence should be addressed: E-mail: I.Dodd@lancaster.ac.uk\nAbbreviations: DI, deficit irrigation; Fdry, Fwet, fraction of total sap flow from the dry and wet parts of the root system; Wleaf, Wsoil, leaf and soil water potential;\nWdry, Wwet, soil water potential of the dry and wet pots; PRD, partial rootzone drying; h, (gravimetric) soil water content; hdry, hwet, soil water content of the\ndry and wet pots; [X-ABA]model, modelled leaf xylem ABA concentration; [X-ABA]leaf, [X-ABA]root, [X-ABA]shoot, leaf, root, and shoot xylem ABA\nconcentration; [X-ABA]dry, [X-ABA]wet, root xylem ABA concentration from the dry and wet parts of the root system.\n\u00aa 2008 The Author(s).\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.0\/uk\/) which\npermits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nIn split-root plants, information on the impact of soil\ndrying on the distribution of water uptake is necessary to\nmodel flows of root-to-shoot signals such as abscisic acid\n(Dodd, 2008; Dodd et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008), that are\nproduced in response to soil drying and can be transported\nin the transpiration stream to the shoots to limit plant\nwater use (Davies and Zhang, 1991; Dodd, 2005). Such\nmodelling has been stimulated by the adoption of\na particular form of deficit irrigation known as partial\nrootzone drying (PRD). This technique deliberately\nimposes soil moisture heterogeneity by independently\nwatering different parts of the rootzone (for example, one\nside of the row) with the aim of manipulating root-to-\nshoot signalling to restrict crop water use (Dry et al.,\n1996). Theoretically, irrigated roots supply sufficient\nwater to the shoots to prevent water deficits (Stoll et al.,\n2000; Sobeih et al., 2004) while roots in drying soil\nproduce chemical signals that can be transmitted to the\nshoots, if there is sufficient sap flow through those roots\n(Dodd et al., 2008). Understanding the relationship\nbetween signal transmission and soil water status of\ndifferent parts of the rootzone might provide a basis to\nunderstand the regulation of shoot physiology during\ndeficit irrigation, and to schedule irrigation during PRD.\nWith this goal in mind, a novel grafting procedure was\ndeveloped (Dodd, 2007) to determine the contributions of\ndifferent parts of the root system to total sap flow and leaf\nxylem ABA concentration ([X-ABA]leaf) of PRD-grown\nplants. Combining the fractions of sap flow and xylem\nABA concentrations from wet and dry parts of the root\nsystem in a simple model, better predicted [X-ABA]leaf\nthan the mean (of wet and dry parts of the root system)\nroot xylem ABA concentration ([X-ABA]root). When soil\nwater status of the wet part of the root system remained\nhigh, there was an optimal soil water status of the dry part\nof the root system to maximize ABA export from the\nentire root system (Dodd et al., 2008). However, in many\nfield experiments with PRD, partial drying of the irrigated\nroots occurs (Kirda et al., 2004) if irrigation is infrequent.\nIt is therefore important to determine whether the model\ncan still robustly predict [X-ABA]leaf when soil water\nstatus of the irrigated root system varies. Possible\ninfluences of two different methods of determining the\nfractions of sap flow from each root system, sap flow\nsensors in vivo (Dodd et al., 2008) and root pressurization\n(Salim and Pitman, 1984), on the prediction of [X-\nABA]leaf were also assessed.\nMaterials and methods\nSap flow in vivo and xylem ABA concentration in sap collected\nfrom de-topped roots and detached leaves\n\u2018Two root-one shoot\u2019 sunflower (Helianthus annuus L. cv. Tall\nSingle Yellow) plants were created using the grafting procedure\npreviously described (Dodd, 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). Grafted\nplants resembled an inverted \u2018Y\u2019 with the root systems contained in\ntwo appressed 0.43 l pots, each designed to fit in a Scholander-type\npressure chamber. Plant culture was as previously described (Dodd\net al., 2008) except that the plants were grown in a different\nsubstrate (John Innes No. 2, J Arthur Bowers, UK). Gravimetric (h)\nand volumetric water content of this substrate at field capacity were\n0.63 g g\u00011 and 0.43 cm3 cm\u00013, respectively, and the bulk density\nwhen dry was 0.78 g cm\u00013. A moisture release curve for this\nsubstrate (Dodd et al., 2006) allowed measurements of h to be\nconverted to soil water potentials (Wsoil) according to the following\nrelationships. For h <0.33 g g\u00011: Wsoil \u00bc \u20131.105 + 3.065h. For h\nbetween 0.33 g g\u00011 and 0.45 g g\u00011: Wsoil \u00bc \u20130.419 + 1.67h\u2013\n1.70h2. For h >0.45 g g\u00011, Wsoil was set to \u20130.01 MPa (which was\nthe lowest pressure that could be measured with the available\npressure plates).\nSap flow through each hypocotyl (below the graft union) of the\n\u2018two root-one shoot\u2019 plants was measured using the heat balance\ntechnique with commercially available sensors (Model SGA-5,\nDynagage\u0001, Dynamax Inc, Houston, TX, USA) as previously\ndescribed (Dodd et al., 2008). Soil water content of each pot, root\nwater potentials, and (root) xylem ABA concentration, whole plant\ntranspiration rate, leaf water potential, and (leaf) xylem ABA\nconcentration were measured as previously described by Dodd\net al. (2008). An overpressure of 0.4 MPa or 0.5 MPa was applied\nto the leaves or root systems respectively (following measurement\nof leaf and root water potential, respectively) to collect xylem sap.\nSeveral batches of plants (comprising 10\u201312 plants per batch)\nwere sequentially produced in the same environmental conditions.\nTwo different irrigation regimes were imposed: deficit irrigation\n(where equal volumes of water were applied to each pot) and partial\nrootzone drying where only one pot received water and the other\nwas allowed to dry the soil. Each individual plant received different\nirrigation volumes in aiming to achieve a range of whole pot soil\nwater contents, estimated during each experiment from measure-\nments of pot weight, and verified later by gravimetric measurement\nof soil water content. Within the PRD irrigation treatment, the\ndesignated \u2018wet\u2019 pot was watered at different frequencies (minimum\nof twice a day) in different plants, in trying to vary soil water\ncontent of the wet pot at harvest.\nPressure-induced sap flow and xylem ABA concentration in\nsap collected above and below the graft union\nSince these experiments aimed to measure sap flow (and ABA\nconcentration) above and below the graft union of \u2018two root-one\nshoot\u2019 plants, and the two pots of plants raised as above would not\nsimultaneously fit in the available whole plant pressure chamber,\nslight cultural modifications (from that described above) were\nrequired. Sunflower seeds were placed on two layers of filter paper\n(Whatman No. 1) moistened with distilled water in a covered Petri\ndish and allowed to germinate in the dark for 48 h. Two identical\nplastic bags were placed in a 1.0 l pot (height of 130 mm, diameter\nof 110 mm, designed to fit in the pressure chamber), and equally\nfilled with the same substrate as above. Before planting, soil water\ncontent of each bag was raised to field capacity to aid seedling\nestablishment. A plastic disc of the same diameter as the pot was\nplaced over the surface of the substrate. This disc had two holes (21\nmm diameter) in it, spaced at the same dimensions as the split-top\nlid designed to fit on the pressure chamber (Seel and Jeschke,\n1999). One germinated seedling (typical radical length of 20 mm)\nwas placed through the middle of each hole into depressions in the\nsubstrate, covered with substrate and watered in. Ten pots were\nplaced into a plastic container (50333328 cm), the top of the\ncontainer covered with aluminium foil (to exclude light and\npromote hypocotyl extension), and the container placed in a single\n4084 Dodd et al.\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nwalk-in controlled environment room (334 m) at the Lancaster\nEnvironment Centre under environmental conditions previously\ndescribed by Kudoyarova et al. (2007). Grafting occurred at the\nsame stage of development as above. After graft establishment,\nplants were watered daily until the beginning of the experiment.\nDuring experiments, half the plants received water to both plastic\nbags (DI) while the remainder only received water to one plastic\nbag (PRD). Prior to sap collection, the pot was placed in the\npressure chamber, a split-top lid placed on top of the chamber, and\neach hypocotyl sealed into the chamber lid using a silicone-based\ndental impression compound (Affinis Fast Regular Body Micro-\nsystem, Coltene-Whaledent, Switzerland) which took no more than\n5 min to set. To collect sap, the whole shoot was removed 1\u20133 cm\nabove the graft union, the stump washed with distilled water and\nthen blotted with filter paper three times, to remove any contam-\ninating cell debris. Washing and blotting was performed after\nsealing the pot into the pressure chamber, thus preventing any\nincrease in soil water content. Preliminary tests showed that\napplying pressures greater than 0.4 MPa generally resulted in leaks\nfrom the pressure seals, and occasionally ejection of the seals. Thus\nall plants were pressurized (with nitrogen) to 0.4 MPa. To\ndetermine the fraction of sap flow from each root system, samples\nwere collected by lightly touching the cut stump with a glass\ncapillary tube, thus avoiding the contamination that results from the\nradial pressure applied by a collecting sleeve. Samples were\ncollected above the graft union, then the hypocotyls were severed\nbelow the graft union, and sap collected as above. If flow rates from\nboth hypocotyls were too high to allow accurate transfer of sap to\npre-weighed Eppendorf tubes, sap samples were collected alter-\nnately from each hypocotyl. All sap was immediately transferred to\npre-weighed Eppendorf tubes then weighed (to determine sap flow\nrate), frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at \u201320 \u0002C. Sap ABA\nconcentration was measured (as above) using a radioimmunoassay\n(Quarrie et al., 1988).\nStatistical analysis\nWithin an irrigation treatment (PRD or DI) or combined across\nirrigation treatments, linear or polynomial regressions determined\nthe significance of relationships between soil and plant variables\n(Tables 1, 2). Two-way ANOVA determined whether irrigation\ntreatment (Tables 1, 2), root system source (Fig. 5a; wet or dry root\nsystems of PRD plants and DI plants), or data set (Fig. 5b) altered\nrelationships between soil and plant variables. A change in the\nsensitivity of the y-variable to the x-variable is given by a significant\ninteraction term (x-variable by treatment).\nResults\nIn a typical \u2018two root-one shoot\u2019 plant grown in two\nseparate pots and subjected to partial rootzone drying\n(Fig. 1a), sap flow through the two hypocotyls was most\nsimilar at the beginning of the experiment when soil water\ncontent of both pots was similar (data collection began\nafter both pots had been watered to the drip point). As the\nexperiment continued, sap flow through the root system\nexposed to drying soil decreased such that when the plant\nwas harvested, heat losses by convection by the sap (Qf)\nfrom the dry and wet root systems were 4.5 mW and 31\nmW, respectively. Thus the fractions of sap flow through\ndry and wet root systems were 0.13 and 0.87, respectively\n(Fig. 1a) and the soil water contents of the dry and wet\npots were 0.28 and 0.53 g g\u00011, respectively. By contrast,\nin a typical deficit-irrigated plant, sap flow through the\ntwo hypocotyls was similar throughout two day\/night\ncycles and decreased similarly as the soil dried (Fig. 1b).\nWhen the plant was harvested, the fractions of sap flow\nthrough the two hypocotyls were 0.43 and 0.57 (Fig. 1b)\nand the soil water contents of the two pots were 0.17 and\n0.18 g g\u00011, respectively.\nTable 1.

In PRD plants, the\nfraction of sap flow through the dry part of the root\nsystem (Fdry) significantly decreased with soil water\ncontent (hdry\u2013 data not shown) or soil water potential of\nthe dry pot (Wdry). This relationship varied according to\nthe soil water status of the irrigated pot: when soil water\npotential was less than 0.45 g g\u00011 (Wwet < \u00010.01 MPa),\nsap flow through the dry part of the root system decreased\nat a lower threshold soil water potential (Fig. 2).

In a plant adequately\nsupplied with water, pressure-induced sap flow through\nthe two hypocotyls was similar (Fig. 3a). Similarly, in\na deficit-irrigated plant, pressure-induced sap flow through\nthe two hypocotyls was also similar (Fig. 3c) although\ntotal sap flow was much less. In a typical plant subjected\nto partial rootzone drying, pressure-induced sap flow\nthrough the dry part of the root system was 40% less than\nsap flow through the wet part of the root system (Fig. 3b).\nSimilar experiments were repeated with a number of\nplants to examine the effect of different irrigation treat-\nments (PRD versus DI) on the relationship between\npressure-induced sap flow through each hypocotyl and\nsoil water potential (Fig. 4). In DI plants, the fraction of\nsap flow through either hypocotyl was similar and varied\nbetween 0.4 and 0.6. In PRD plants, the fraction of sap\nflow through the dry part of the root system significantly\n(P <0.001) decreased with soil water potential. The\nrelatively few data points where soil water content of the\nirrigated pot was less than 0.45 g g\u00011 prevented further\ndiscrimination of this relationship (as in Fig. 2). Relation-\nships between the fraction of sap flow through the dry part\nof the root system (Fdry) and soil water content or\npotential were compared statistically (Table 1) to de-\ntermine whether the sensitivity of sap flow to drying soil\nvaried according to the method of sap flow measurement.\nWhen the soil water content of the wet part of the root\nsystem exceeded 0.45 g g\u00011, irrespective of whether Fdry\nwas plotted against soil water content (hdry) or soil water\npotential (Wdry) of the dry part of the root system, the\nslope of the relationship in vivo (Fig. 2) was equivalent to\nthat obtained from pressure-induced sap flow measure-\nments (Fig. 4).\nFor the \u2018two root-one shoot\u2019 plants grown in two separate\npots, whole plant transpiration rate was more closely\ncorrelated with leaf xylem ABA concentration ([X-ABA]leaf)\nthan either whole pot soil water content or leaf water\npotential (Table 2). Consequently, the regulation of [X-\nABA]leaf was further considered. [X-ABA]leaf significantly\nincreased as leaf water potential or whole pot soil water\ncontent declined (data not shown). Irrigation treatment\nsignificantly affected the relationship between [X-ABA]leaf\nand leaf water potential (Table 2), with the slope of this\nincrease greater in DI plants (data not shown).\nRoot xylem ABA concentration increased as Wsoil\ndecreased, with samples collected from the dry or wet part\nof the root system of a PRD plant or from a DI plant giving\na similar relationship (Fig. 5a). Tomato (Dodd, 2007) and\nsunflower had a similar [X-ABA]root when soil water\ncontent was < \u20130.43 MPa or > \u20130.01 MPa, while at\nintermediate values it was, on average, 3-fold higher in\ntomato. However, [X-ABA]root was similarly sensitive to\nWsoil in both species (species3Wsoil interaction was not\nsignificant: P\u00bc0.37) despite species differences in absolute\n[X-ABA]root.

At\nany soil water potential, root xylem ABA concentration\nwas calculated from the exponential relationship fitted\nto the data from two appressed pots in Fig. 5\n([X-ABA]root\u00bc6.30930.0007Wsoil; r2\u00bc0.55), while the\nfraction of sap flow from roots in dry soil was calculated\nfrom the equation Fdry\u00bcmWdry+c. When Wwet was \u20130.09\nMPa (analogous to data set II; see Table 1), m and c\nequalled 1.65 and 0.91, respectively. Maintaining param-\neter m constant, irrespective of Wwet (in line with the\nstatistical analysis of Table 1), resulted in parameter c\nequalling 0.71 and 0.5 for Wwet of \u20130.045 MPa and \u20130.01\nMPa, respectively (note that the latter case is realistic\nsince the fraction of sap flow through either of two root\nsystems exposed to an equal, high Wsoil should equal 0.5).\nThus it was possible to calculate the fraction of sap flow\nfrom roots in drying soil as Wdry varied (Fig. 7a).\nIrrespective of Wwet, simulated [X-ABA]leaf of PRD plants\nincreased to a maximum, then decreased as the fraction of\nsap flow from roots in drying soil decreased (Fig. 7b).\nThus Wdry to maximize [X-ABA]leaf of PRD plants varied\naccording to Wwet. When compared at the same whole pot\nWsoil, there were minimal (<5 nM) differences in\nsimulated [X-ABA]leaf between PRD and DI plants, until\nthe fraction of sap flow through roots of PRD plants in\ndrying soil declined. As Wdry continued to decline, [X-\nABA]leaf of PRD plants decreased relative to DI plants at\nthe same whole pot Wsoil (Fig. 7c).\nDiscussion\nAs in previous studies with sunflower (Tardieu et al.,\n1996; Dodd et al., 2008), plant water use was more\nTable 3.

That this occurred in\nan anisohydric plant like sunflower that does not tightly\ncontrol its leaf water status (Tardieu et al., 1996) provides\nfurther impetus for understanding the factor(s) that\nregulate [X-ABA]leaf in vivo. Since [X-ABA]leaf was more\nclosely related to soil water status than leaf water potential\n(Tardieu et al., 1996; Dodd et al., 2008) (Table 2), root\nxylem ABA concentration was measured in attempting to\nexplain variation in [X-ABA]leaf.\nAlthough plants were grown in two slightly different\nsystems (two appressed pots versus two plastic bags in\na single pot) and xylem sap was collected slightly\ndifferently in each (a constant overpressure exceeding root\nbalancing pressure versus a constant pressure), the re-\nlationship between [X-ABA]root and Wsoil arising from the\ntwo studies was similar (Fig. 5b). While [X-ABA]root\nincreases with decreasing sap flow rate (Else et al., 1995;\nDodd et al., 2008), any differences in [X-ABA]root caused\nby the sap collection technique were much smaller than\nspecies differences (Fig. 5a). In another study, grapevine\ncultivars with a higher [X-ABA]leaf better controlled their\nleaf water status (Soar et al., 2006b), and it is possible that\nthe lower [X-ABA]root (Fig. 5a) (and [X-ABA]leaf) of\nsunflower (a known anisohydric species) compared to\ntomato (which displays more isohydric behaviour in the\nfield; Reid and Renquist, 1997) is of functional signifi-\ncance. Alternatively, species differences in stomatal\nsensitivity to xylem ABA concentration may be responsi-\nble for anisohydric versus isohydric behaviour (Tardieu\nand Simonneau, 1998).\nIt has been suggested that measurement of [X-ABA]leaf\nmay provide a marker for comparative water use physiol-\nogy of different scion\u2013rootstock combinations in grape-\nvine (Soar et al., 2006a). While the relationship between\n[X-ABA]leaf and soil water status may be robust when soil\nmoisture is more uniformly distributed, as occurs in pots\n(Dodd, 2007), field-grown plants will often be exposed to\nheterogeneous soil moisture and differences in rooting\npatterns between different genotypes (or rootstocks) may\nbe responsible for differences in [X-ABA]leaf. For exam-\nple, a genotype with a relatively shallow root system\nrestricted to the upper soil profile may be exposed to\na relatively uniform soil water status, while a deeper-\nrooting genotype which deploys some roots in the moist\nsubsoil may source much of its transpirational flux from\nthese roots. Such differences in rooting pattern probably\ninfluence root-to-shoot ABA signalling.\nIndeed, soil moisture heterogeneity (imposed by partial\nrootzone drying here) limited the export of ABA from\nroots to shoots, as sap flow from roots in drying soil\ndecreased with soil drying (Dodd et al., 2008). The effect\nof diminished sap flow through drying roots of PRD\nplants (Fig. 2) was evident in soil moisture heterogeneity\ninfluencing the relationship between [X-ABA]leaf and\nWleaf such that DI plants had a higher [X-ABA]leaf at\na given Wleaf or Wsoil (Dodd, 2007; Dodd et al., 2008)\n(Table 2). Accounting for this diminished sap flow in\na simple model (equation 1) improved the prediction of\n[X-ABA]leaf in PRD plants compared to predictions made\nby models based on measurements of [X-ABA]root alone\n(Fig. 6; Table 3; see also Dodd et al., 2008).\nHowever, a related study found that [X-ABA]root of\nPRD plants was better explained by a predicted mean [X-\nABA]root (of wet and dry parts of the root system) based\non a predetermined relationship between Wsoil and [X-\nABA]root in plants grown with homogenous soil moisture\n(Liu et al., 2008), rather than accounting for the fractions\nof sap flow from different parts of the root system.\nMeasured [X-ABA]root of PRD plants higher than\nexpected (based on relative sap flow from the different\nparts of the root system) may occur if root pressurization\nforces water through (drier) parts of the root than those\nparts employed when water is drawn along water potential\ngradients in vivo. This hypothesis was explicitly tested, by\ncomparing the effect of Wsoil on the fractions of in vivo\n(Fig. 2) and pressure-induced (Fig. 4) sap flow through\nthe dry part of the root system, and proved false, since the\nslope of the relationship between the fraction of sap flow\nand Wsoil was statistically equivalent in both data sets\n(Table 1).\nAnother possible explanation for the result that account-\ning for sap flows did not improve the prediction of [X-\nABA]root in PRD plants (Liu et al., 2008), may lie in the\nparticular regression (between Wsoil and [X-ABA]root in\nnon-irrigated plants) used to predict [X-ABA]root of PRD\nplants. Although Wsoil of the dry compartment of PRD\nplants remained above \u20130.175 MPa (Fig. 2b of Liu et al.,\n2008), the regression between Wsoil and [X-ABA]root\n(Table 4, Regression A) was extended to a minimum\nWsoil of \u20130.5 MPa (Fig. 6 of Liu et al., 2008).\nAccordingly, a new regression (Table 4, Regression B)\nthat included only data where Wsoil exceeded \u20130.175 MPa\nwas used to predict [X-ABA]dry and [X-ABA]wet.\nMeasured [X-ABA]root of PRD plants (Fig. 5 of Liu\net al., 2008; Table 4, column 2) was compared against\nmean [X-ABA]root (Table 4, column 5), and [X-ABA]root\nmodelled according to equation 1 (Table 4, column 6),\nusing the fractions of sap flow from wet and dry root\nsystems of PRD plants previously determined (Fig. 3b of\nLiu et al., 2008).\nInterestingly, prediction of [X-ABA]dry and [X-ABA]wet\nwith Regression B (using the same range of Wsoil as\nexperienced by PRD plants) altered the conclusion of that\nstudy. Using Regression A, as in the original paper (Liu\net al., 2008), the mean of [X-ABA]dry and [X-ABA]wet\n(which over the first drying cycle of PRD overestimated\n[X-ABA]root by 17 nM) better predicted [X-ABA]root\nthan equation 1 (which underestimated [X-ABA]root by\n42 nM). However, using Regression B, equation 1 (which\n4090 Dodd et al.\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \noverestimated [X-ABA]root by 20 nM) better predicted [X-\nABA]root than the mean of [X-ABA]dry and [X-ABA]wet\n(which overestimated [X-ABA]root by 58 nM). Some\ncaution should be exercised in interpreting this re-\nanalysis, as mean xylem ABA concentrations, fractions of\nsap flow, and soil water potentials (re-elaborated from the\nfigures of Liu et al., 2008) rather than data for individual\nplants, were used. However, in the absence of accurate\nmeasurements of [X-ABA]dry and [X-ABA]wet which are\nonly possible in grafted plants, the specific regression\nfitted between Wsoil and [X-ABA]root is key in determin-\ning the success of equation 1 in forecasting xylem ABA\nconcentrations in the shoot.\nHowever, the predictive ability of equation 1 was\ninfluenced by the site (and\/or methodology) at which\nxylem sap samples were collected. That equation 1\nconsistently overestimated detached leaf xylem ABA\nconcentration of PRD plants (Fig. 6a) was not a deficiency\nof the model, as the same overestimation was detected\nwhen [X-ABA]leaf was plotted against the mean [X-\nABA]root of DI sunflower plants (Dodd et al., 2008).\nFurthermore, this problem was not evident when [X-\nABA] was measured above and below the graft union in\nsamples collected by root pressurization (Fig. 6b),\nsuggesting that the graft union itself had little influence\non ABA signalling. Although xylem sap collection from\ndetached leaves using a Scholander-type pressure chamber\nestimated [X-ABA]leaf in sunflower (Tardieu et al., 1996),\nsince samples can be collected in the field (Dodd et al.,\n1996), direct comparisons against leaf xylem samples\ncollected by root pressurization of intact plants (Schurr\net al., 1992) are lacking. Although this comparison was\nenvisaged in this study, failure of the pressure seals at\npressures insufficient to collect xylem sap from a leaf in\nthe canopy prevented its realization. However, because\n[X-ABA]root and [X-ABA]leaf were correlated in DI plants\n(Dodd, 2007; Dodd et al., 2008), it suggested that\nmeasurements of [X-ABA]root and sap flow could usefully\npredict [X-ABA]leaf of PRD plants.\nWhile a previous study in a different substrate de-\nveloped a single relationship between the fraction of sap\nflow through the dry part of the root system and soil water\ncontent (Dodd et al., 2008), here two different relation-\nships were distinguished according to the soil water status\nof the irrigated pot (Fig. 2). However, irrespective of\nWwet, the slope of the decrease in the fraction of sap flow\nfrom roots in drying soil was similarly sensitive to Wdry\n(Table 1). This indicates that it is still possible to impose\nPRD (and achieve differential sap flow from wet and dry\nroot systems) even when Wwet falls below \u20130.01 MPa,\neven though many experiments aim to keep part of the\nroot system above this threshold (Leib et al., 2006; Liu\net al., 2006). Maintaining some roots above this threshold\nmay explain the limited effect of PRD on stomatal\nresponse in some experiments, due to diminished sap flow\nand signalling from the dry part of the root system (Yao\net al., 2001, Dodd et al., 2008). Instead, the effects of\nPRD on [X-ABA]leaf (and stomatal responses) should be\nevaluated at a range of (entire rootzone) soil water\navailabilities by maintaining a Wsoil difference between\nTable 4.

The fraction of sap flow from the dry part of the root system (Fdry) was\nderived from Fig. 3b of Liu et al. (2008), and for days 2, 3, 4, and 5 was 0.39, 0.34, 0.25, and 0.11, respectively, while Fwet was 1\u2013Fdry. Predicted\nxylem ABA concentrations from wet and dry parts of the root system were calculated from regressions of xylem ABA concentration (from the entire\nroot system of non-irrigated plants) on soil water potential (as in Fig. 6 of Liu et al., 2008), and water potentials of wet and dry parts of root systems\nwere measured (Fig. 2b of Liu et al., 2008). On days 2, 3, 4, and 5, Wsoil of the dry part of the root system was \u201323, \u201358, \u2013123, and \u2013164 kPa,\nrespectively, and Wsoil of the wet part of the root system was \u201312, \u201310, \u201316, and \u201323 kPa, respectively. Two different regressions were fitted:\nRegression A where [X-ABA] \u00bc 2.61Wsoil+115.2 (as in Fig. 6 of Liu et al., 2008) and Regression B (fitted to all data in Fig. 6 of Liu et al., 2008\nwhere Wsoil > \u2013175 kPa \u2013the minimum Wdry achieved by day 5 of PRD) where [X-ABA] \u00bc 1.68Wsoil+206. For each day, the difference between\nmean or model and measurement is calculated as [X-ABA]model minus [X-ABA]root.

While equation 1 allows\n[X-ABA]leaf to be simulated for a wide (theoretical) range\nof soil water potentials (Dodd, 2008), irrigation frequen-\ncies and volumes relative to transpirational losses will\ndetermine whether a Wsoil difference between wet and dry\nroot systems is actually achieved. That soil moisture of\nplants exposed to PRD in the field is not always\nheterogeneously distributed (Kirda et al., 2004; Du et al.,\n2006) may partially explain why irrigation treatment\n(PRD versus DI) does not always significantly affect\nshoot physiology.\nContinuous soil moisture monitoring (Gu et al., 2004;\nLeib et al., 2006) can help irrigation managers to impose\nsoil moisture differences between dry and wet root\nsystems during PRD, with the aim of inducing partial\nstomatal closure. Stomatal responses will depend on\nsignal production by roots in contact with drying soil\n(Zhang and Davies, 1989), signal transfer to the xylem\n(Fig. 5), and signal transmission to the shoot depending\non the relative sap flow from different parts of the root\nsystem (Figs 2, 4). While [X-ABA]leaf cannot be moni-\ntored with sufficient temporal resolution to be used in\nirrigation scheduling, its effects can be determined directly\nby monitoring plant water use via porometry, infra-red\nthermography or sap flow (Jones, 2004), or indirectly by\nquantifying soil moisture depletion (Liu et al., 2008).\nModelling [X-ABA]leaf based on differences in Wsoil\nbetween different parts of the root system, and sap flow\nfrom those root systems has shown that Wdry should be\nmaintained within a certain range to maximize ABA\nsignalling (Dodd, 2008; Dodd et al., 2008; Liu et al.,\n2008; Fig. 7b). However, the fact that this range varies\nwith Wwet (Fig. 7b) suggests that irrigation scheduling\nduring PRD, based on Wdry set points, may need to be\nflexible according to the Wsoil surrounding the irrigated\nroot system. In practice, in the absence of rainfall, Wdry\ndecreases continuously during a drying cycle (Gu et al.,\n2004; Leib et al., 2006) and to avoid ABA concentration\ndecreasing as the soil becomes too dry (Fig. 7b), the wet\nand dry parts of the rootzone are alternated. While\nalternation itself transiently increases xylem ABA con-\ncentration (Dodd et al., 2006; Topcu et al., 2007; but see\nLiu et al., 2008), the soil water status at which such\nalternation events should occur has not been defined\nphysiologically. Instead, soil is allowed to dry during\nPRD for a pre-determined (usually arbitrary) period of\ntime (Gu et al., 2004; Leib et al., 2006) or until a certain\n(usually arbitrary) soil water content is reached (Davies\net al., 2000; Antolin et al., 2006) before the dry part of the\nroot system is re-irrigated. Whether the ABA modelling\napproach developed here can inform and complement\nplant- or soil-based methods of scheduling irrigation of\nPRD plants remains to be determined.\nDespite much interest in, and widespread adoption of,\nPRD as a management tool (reviewed in Costa et al.,\n2007; Dodd, 2007; Kirda et al., 2007), concerns remain\nthat its physiological effects are difficult to distinguish\nfrom deficit irrigation generally, when the same irrigation\nvolumes are applied. While the physiological bases for\ndifferences between DI and PRD plants are only just\nstarting to be understood (Dodd et al., 2008), assessing\nroot-to-shoot signalling of plants exposed to different\ndegrees of soil moisture heterogeneity would seem\nnecessary to determine whether PRD enhances or dimin-\nishes (Fig. 7c) signalling according to total soil water\navailability. Given the range of crops and substrates to\nwhich PRD is applied, modelling ABA (and other plant\ngrowth regulators) signalling may provide a parsimonious\nframework of analysis to complement existing multi-\nfactorial field trials.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank DEFRA (Contract HH3609STX) and the British\nCouncil\u2013German Academic Exchange Service (Project 281) for\nsupport of this work, and Maureen Harrison for plant care.
