This needs to be considered when designing interventions to\nreduce obesity in young children, in terms of both benefits and harms.\nBackground\nObesity presents major health threat around the globe.\nWithin the UK, prevalence of overweight and obesity\nhas escalated in the last 30 years [1], and tackling this is\na government priority [2]. There is a particular focus on\nchildren, where rates of obesity are predicted to treble\nover the next 50 years [3] with consequent impact on\nadult obesity and its related health consequences [4,5].\nPsychosocial factors are particularly important in child-\nhood obesity [4,6] and need to be better understood and\nconsidered when designing prevention interventions.\nBody image is a psychosocial dimension, defined by\nSchilder in the 1930 s as \u2018the picture of our own body\nwhich we form in our own mind\u2019 [7]. It is clear, how-\never, from emergent research in the field, that body\nimage is a multidimensional concept, incorporating neu-\nrological, psychological and sociocultural elements, and\nthe complexity of the construct is not reflected in\nSchilder\u2019s definition [8]. Body image is viewed as central\nto many aspects of human functioning, including emo-\ntions, thoughts, behaviours and relationships. Therefore,\nthe effect of body image on quality of life is potentially\nextensive [8].\nMuch of the research into body image has been in the\nfield of eating disorders. There are two types of distur-\nbance of body image; perceptual and attitudinal.\n* Correspondence: M.J.Pallan@bham.ac.uk\n1Unit of Public Health, Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of\nBirmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPallan et al.

Perceptual\nand attitudinal body image distortion correlates with\nincreased psychological distress and disordered eating\n[10], and body image distortion is a diagnostic criterion\nfor both anorexia and bulimia nervosa [11]. Obesity is\nalso recognised as part of the spectrum of conditions\nrelated to disordered eating, and with the escalation of\nthe obesity problem, its relationship to body image and\ndissatisfaction has become a focus of research [10,12]. A\nconsistent relationship between increasing weight status\nand body dissatisfaction in older children has been\nobserved in many different cultural communities\n[13-23]. In younger children however, the association is\nless clear [24]. Relatively little is known about body\nimage development in children, and most studies in this\narea involve small, predominantly white samples. A\nnegative attitude towards a fat body shape has been\nobserved in children as young as 4 [25], although the\nemergence of actual body dissatisfaction appears to be\nsometime after this, becoming more pronounced in\nmiddle childhood and early adolescence [26,27]. In a US\nstudy looking at weight concerns and body dissatisfac-\ntion in 5 year old girls, Davison et al. found an associa-\ntion between body dissatisfaction and weight status, but\noverall, body dissatisfaction was relatively infrequent in\nthis age group [24]. In a longitudinal study of the same\ncohort no significant differences in weight concern and\nbody dissatisfaction were found when comparing normal\nweight and overweight at age 5, but by age 9, the differ-\nences were highly significant [28,29]. Significant longitu-\ndinal associations between weight status in childhood\nand later body dissatisfaction have also been found. Sev-\neral studies report that overweight or obesity in child-\nhood or adolescence predicts body dissatisfaction at a\nlater stage in both sexes [18,21,29-32]. Body dissatisfac-\ntion in turn is linked to later weight status, and asso-\nciated behaviours. Body dissatisfaction in adolescence\nhas been associated with excess weight gain in the fol-\nlowing years [33,34], and with later unhealthy beha-\nviours such as binge eating, unhealthy dieting, decreased\nphysical activity and unhealthy weight control beha-\nviours [35]. In addition, early childhood body dissatisfac-\ntion in girls has been found to be associated with later\nmaladaptive eating attitudes and dieting [28].\nOne problem in examining body image and body dis-\nsatisfaction in children and in comparing different stu-\ndies is the lack of consistency in measurement\ninstruments and the limited range of validated measures.\nIn general, there are two types of measures; figure rating\nscales and questionnaires, each with their own merits\nand limitations [26,27]. The former consist of a series of\nfigure drawings ranging from very thin to obese, and\nparticipants can indicate the figure they most think they\nresemble. These are easy to administer to children, with\nhigh test-retest reliability in those age 6 and above\n[36,37]. The validity of these instruments in younger\nchildren is unknown, although despite some biases [38]\nsignificant correlation between selected figures and\nactual body size (measured by BMI) has been found in\nchildren as young as 7. Questionnaire measures range\nfrom simple questions such as \u2018how satisfied are you\nwith your appearance [27] to the Eating Disorders\nInventory Body Dissatisfaction Scale (which assesses\nbeliefs around various body parts and fatness) [39] and\nthe Body Esteem Scale (which assesses children\u2019s atti-\ntudes and feelings about their bodies) [40]. The validity\nand reliability of these instruments in children younger\nthan 8 is unknown [26,27].\nSex differences in body dissatisfaction and its relation-\nship to weight status have been found among older chil-\ndren [26]. Body dissatisfaction and a desire to be\nthinner are equally prevalent among overweight boys\nand girls. However underweight boys attach importance\nto having big muscles [20,21,41] and are therefore more\nlikely to desire a larger body size than underweight girls\n[42].\nVariation in body dissatisfaction related to weight sta-\ntus by ethnic group has also been studied. Unsurpris-\ningly, the influence of ethnicity on body dissatisfaction\nis complex and interacts with other factors, such as soci-\netal, media and peer influences [14,22,23,26,43]. Some\npatterns have nevertheless emerged. For example, body\ndissatisfaction among overweight African-American chil-\ndren is less marked than among their white counterparts\n[26,43,44], although this is not consistent across all set-\ntings [22,45]. On the other hand, among Native Ameri-\ncan Indians, with high prevalence of obesity and\ndiabetes [46], body dissatisfaction was positively asso-\nciated with weight status among children [14,18]. This\ncontrasts with previous beliefs that obesity is culturally\nacceptable in these populations.\nLittle research into body dissatisfaction and its asso-\nciation with weight status in UK South Asian children\nhas been undertaken. This group represent a particular\ntarget for obesity prevention, as the incidence of obe-\nsity-related diseases are greater than among the general\nUK population [47,48]. A better understanding of ethnic\nand cultural norms related to obesity among this hetero-\ngeneous community is essential for planning interven-\ntions. One study which included South Asians reported\na strong association between body fatness and body dis-\nsatisfaction among adolescents [19], but it is not known\nwhether this association holds true for younger children.\nIn summary, currently there is insufficient understand-\ning of when the relationship between body dissatisfac-\ntion and weight status develops in children and what\nPallan et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11:21\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/11\/21\nPage 2 of 8\nthe correlates of such a relationship are, particularly in\nrelation to ethnicity. In this study we use baseline data\nfrom a childhood obesity prevention study to explore\nbody image size and dissatisfaction and its relationship\nto weight status in a UK sample of South Asian boys\nand girls aged 5 to 7 years. This information is impor-\ntant for informing approaches to obesity prevention and\nmanagement in children from these ethnic groups.\nMethods\nParticipants\nParticipants were part of the Birmingham Healthy Eat-\ning and Active Lifestyle for Children Study (BEACHeS),\nwhich aimed to develop and pilot a childhood obesity\nprevention intervention, focusing on South Asians. For\nthe main study, 574 children (of a possible 1090; 53%)\nin years 1 and 2 (age 5-7) from eight primary schools in\nBirmingham, a major UK city, participated. Schools\nwith predominantly South Asian children were selected.\nWritten consent was obtained from parents of the parti-\ncipating children, and verbal assent obtained from the\nparticipating children. The study was reviewed and\napproved by the East Birmingham Local Research Ethics\nCommittee. Data on ethnicity were obtained from\nschool records, based on parental report. The mean\nstudy sample age was 6.5 years (SD = 0.6) with equal\ngender split. The ethnic breakdown of participants was\nSouth Asian: Pakistani 66.9%, Bangladeshi 14.3%, Indian\n4.7%; Black 7.8%; White 2.3%; other 4.0%. Each child\u2019s\nhome postcode was used to assign a Townsend depriva-\ntion score based on the 2001 census and scores were\ncompared to the ranking of scores assigned to postcode\nareas within the West Midlands Government Office\nRegion. Ninety-four percent of children had postcodes\nthat were within the most deprived decile for the\nregion.\nMeasurement of weight status\nTrained researchers undertook height and weight mea-\nsurements using standardised instruments and proce-\ndures. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1\ncentimetres using a Leicester height measure. Weight\nwas measured in light clothing and no shoes to the\nnearest 0.1 kg using a Tanita TBF 300 MA body compo-\nsition analyser. Body Mass Index was calculated by the\nformula; weight (kg)\/height (m)2 and standard deviation\nscores (BMI z-scores) derived using the age and sex spe-\ncific UK National 1990 BMI percentiles reference data\n[49]. Children were also categorised as underweight,\nhealthy weight, overweight and obese, according to the\nUK 1990 reference data, using the 2nd, 85th and 95th\npercentiles to define these categories. These definitions\nare in line with national childhood obesity prevalence\nmonitoring programmes (such as the National Child\nMeasurement Programme), and the 95th percentile defi-\nnition for obesity has been shown to have a high sensi-\ntivity and specificity [50].\nMeasurement of body image\nA figure rating scale, developed by Collins [36] and\nadapted by Rand and Resnick [51] was used to assess\nbody image. The 3 day test-retest reliability coefficients\nof the instrument developed by Collins are 0.71 for per-\nceived self image and 0.59 for ideal self image for chil-\ndren age 6 to 9. The correlation between perceived self\nimage size and BMI was 0.37 in the same age group\n[36]. Gender and skin colour specific drawings consisted\nof 9 prepubescent figures ranging from very under-\nweight (value = 1) to very overweight (value = 9). Chil-\ndren were asked; \u201cWhich picture looks the most like\nyou look?\u201d, and \u201cWhich picture shows the way you want\nto look?\u201d to assess \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018ideal self\u2019 respectively\n(scores ranging from 1 to 9 for each). A body dissatis-\nfaction (BDS) score was derived by subtracting the \u2018ideal\nself\u2019 from the \u2018self\u2019 score, (scores ranging from -8 to +8).\nThus negative or positive scores indicated the child per-\nceived him\/herself as thinner or more overweight than\nideal respectively, whilst a zero score indicated they\nwere satisfied.\nProcedure\nData collection took place from December 2006 to May\n2007. On the day of data collection, small groups of\nchildren (4) were taken from class to a separate room,\nand rotated around four separate data collection sta-\ntions, consisting of either physical measures, or psycho-\nsocial instruments. Children were with trained\nresearchers on a one-to-one basis at each station.\nResearchers followed standard operating procedures for\nboth physical and psychosocial measures. In the case of\nthe latter, there were clear guidelines to ensure children\nunderstood the questions that they were being asked,\nincluding repetition of the question and checking of\ntheir understanding.\nAnalysis\nAnalysis was undertaken using the STATA (version 10)\nstatistical package. The outcome variables explored were\nperception of self, perception of ideal self, and body dis-\nsatisfaction scores. For bivariate categorical comparisons,\nchi squared tests were performed. Multiple regression\nanalyses were performed for each outcome, with weight\nstatus, sex, age and ethnicity included as independent\nvariables. Two alternative variables were used for weight\nstatus; BMI z-score and binary weight category (not\noverweight\/obese versus overweight\/obese). Ethnicity\nwas categorised into 4 groups; Pakistani, Indian, Bangla-\ndeshi and Other.\nPallan et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11:21\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/11\/21\nPage 3 of 8\nResults\nData on age, gender, ethnicity and weight status were\nobtained for all 574 children, and 571 children com-\npleted the body image assessment.\nWeight status\nThe mean BMI z-score for the sample was 0.03 (SD\n1.38). One fifth of participants were either overweight or\nobese, with girls significantly more likely to be both\noverweight and obese (Table 1). There were no signifi-\ncant differences across different ethnic or age groups.\nPerception of body image (self)\nThe median self image score for the total sample was 4\n(IQR = 2-5). The distribution of scores (Table 2) was\nsimilar across sexes, age, and ethnic groups, except the\nIndian sub-group, which had a lower median score\n(M = 3, IQR 1-4). The obese group had a higher median\nscore than other categories (M = 5, IQR = 4-5)\nMultiple regression models indicated that lower BMI\nz-score (or not being overweight\/obese) was significantly\nassociated with lower \u201cself\u201d image size perception scores\n(thinner self image) (tables 3 and 4). Ethnicity (Indian sub-\ngroup) and sex (being female) were also significantly asso-\nciated with thinner self perception scores. The magnitudes\nof the associations were small. Subgroup analysis by sex\nfound that the association between weight status and self\nperception image size was only significant for girls.\nPerception of ideal self\nThe median score for \u201cideal self\u201d was lower than that for\n\u201cself\u201d image size (M = 3, IQR = 2-5). Girls had a lower\nmedian score than boys. Distribution of scores is shown in\ntable 2 and did not differ greatly across age and ethnic\ngroups, although Indians had the lowest median score.\nIn contrast with the self image scores, the obese category\nhad the lowest median score for ideal self image (M = 2,\nIQR = 1-4).\nMultiple regression models showed that adjusted for\nother factors, increasing BMI z-score (or being over-\nweight\/obese) was significantly associated with lower\nideal self scores (thinner shapes) (tables 3 and 4), and\non stratified analysis, this finding was consistent in both\nsexes.

Eigh-\nteen percent were satisfied with their body size (BDS\nscore = 0), 37.3% perceived themselves as too thin (BDS\nscore < 0), and 44.7% as too fat (BDS > 0, table 5).\nMean scores across weight categories differed signifi-\ncantly (F = 14.51, p < 0.001), with the overweight and\nobese categories having higher dissatisfaction scores\nthan the healthy and underweight categories.\nMultiple regression analyses indicated that adjusted for\nother factors, increasing body dissatisfaction score was\nassociated with increasing BMI z-score (or overweight\/\nobese) and increasing age. There was no significant asso-\nciation with gender or ethnic subgroup (tables 3 and 4).\nDiscussion\nWe found a high rate of body dissatisfaction (over 80%)\nand a significant relationship between objectively mea-\nsured weight status and body image perception and body\ndissatisfaction in UK South Asian children as young as 5.\nThe findings indicate that even at this age, children have\nsome self-awareness about their weight status and a con-\ncept of societal norms. The finding that self image percep-\ntion is associated with weight status only in girls implies\nthat they may be more aware of their body shape than\nboys at this age, although overweight and obese boys and\ngirls appear to suffer similar levels of body dissatisfaction.\nThe association between increasing weight status and\nbody dissatisfaction found in this study has been little\nexplored in such young children in the past. Previous\nstudies based on small samples (n < 200) of mostly\nwhite girls in Pennsylvania have shown an association\nthat becomes clearer with increasing age, such that by\nthe age of 8, the relationship between increasing weight\nand body dissatisfaction is firmly established [24,28,29].\nWe also found that the association was stronger with\nincreasing age, but our findings based on a large, mixed\nsex sample suggests that body dissatisfaction with\nincreasing weight status is established even in the\nyoungest age group and is seen in both boys and girls.\nOther studies have reported sex differences in body dis-\nsatisfaction, although these were generally observed\namong children over the age of 8 [26,32,52]. Our findings\nsuggest that sex differences in body dissatisfaction are\nnot apparent in early childhood in this population. It may\nbe that such differences will become apparent in the ado-\nlescent period, or that differences are less pronounced in\nthis ethnic group. A Malaysian study of body dissatisfac-\ntion in adolescents found a sex difference in Chinese, but\nnot in Malay or Indian adolescents [53].\nWeak but significant associations between female sex\nand lower scores for perceived self and perceived ideal\nself were found, indicating that on average, the perceived\nnorms for body size are smaller for girls compared to\nboys. The sex difference in size for ideal self is coherent\nwith previous findings that boys generally prefer larger\nbody size and attach importance to being muscular,\nalong with concerns about weight [20,21,41,52].\nTable 4 Linear regression models to examine perceived\nself, ideal self and body dissatisfaction scores in relation\nto being overweight\/obese vs. not overweight\/obese\nVariable Perceived self\n(Adjusted R2 =\n0.05, F = 5.56\n(df = 6),\np < 0.0001)\nPerceived ideal\nself\n(Adjusted R2 =\n0.08, F = 8.71\n(df = 6),\np < 0.0001)\nBody\ndissatisfaction\n(Adjusted R2 =\n0.06, F = 7.14\n(df = 6),\np < 0.0001)\nb (95% CI) b (95% CI) b (95% CI)\nOverweight\/\nobese\u2020\n0.63**\n(0.26-0.99)\n-0.85***\n(-1.23\u20130.46)\n1.47*** (0.99-1.96)\nFemale\u2021 -0.63***\n(-0.92\u20130.33)\n-0.75***\n(-1.06\u20130.44)\n0.13 (-0.26-0.52)\n\u2191 age\n(months)\n0.003\n(-0.02-0.02)\n-0.02*\n(-0.05\u20130.003)\n0.03\n(<0.001-0.06)\nIndian\u00a7 -0.93*\n(-1.70\u20130.16)\n-0.37 (-1.19-0.44) -0.55 (-1.58-0.47)\nPakistani -0.07 (-0.50-0.35) 0.11 (-0.34-0.56) -0.19 (-0.75-0.38)\nOther -0.12 (-0.67-0.42) 0.34 (-0.23-0.92) -0.47 (-1.19-0.26)\nReference is: \u2020 not overweight\/obese, \u2021 male, \u00a7 Bangladeshi.\n*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\nTable 5 Body dissatisfaction by sex, age, ethnicity and\nweight status\nNumber (%)\nperceives self\nas too thin\n(BDS score < 0)\nNumber (%)\nsatisfied\n(BDS\nscore = 0)\nNumber (%)\nperceives self\nas too fat\n(BDS score > 0)\nTotal 212 (37.3) 102 (18.0) 254 (44.7)\nSex*\nBoys 116 (39.5) 57 (19.4) 121 (41.2)\nGirls 96 (34.7) 48 (17.3) 133 (48.0)\nAge\u2020\nAge 5 59 (41.3) 30 (21.0) 54 (37.8)\nAge 6 111 (37.5) 46 (15.5) 139 (47.0)\nAge 7 42 (31.8) 29 (22.0) 61 (46.2)\nEthnicity\u2021\nBangladeshi 25 (30.9) 18 (22.2) 38 (46.9)\nIndian 15 (55.6) 1 (3.7) 11 (40.7)\nPakistani 140 (36.7) 77 (20.2) 165 (43.2)\nOther 39.5 (32) 11.1 (9) 49.4 (40)\nWeight category\u00a7\nUnderweight 4 (26.7) 4 (26.7) 7 (46.7)\nHealthy weight 186 (42.5) 80 (18.3) 172 (39.3)\nOverweight 11 (26.2) 9 (21.4) 22 (52.4)\nObese 11 (15.1) 9 (12.3) 53 (72.6)\n* c2 = 2.72 (df = 2), p = 0.26.\n\u2020 c2 = 6.37 (df = 4), p = 0.17.\n\u2021 c2 = 11.04 (df = 6), p = 0.09.\n\u00a7 c2 = 33.03 (df = 6), p < 0.001.\nPallan et al.

Studies looking at differ-\nent ethnic populations of older children have reported\ndifferences in body image and body dissatisfaction,\nalthough the findings have not always supported prior\nassumptions about the ethnic groups under study\n[14,18,19,22,53]. In this study, we found few ethnic sub-\ngroup differences in the three outcomes. Indian children\ntended to have lower weight status and smaller ideal\nbody image size compared to the other South Asian\ngroups. However, the small number of subjects in Indian\nsubgroup (n = 27), makes interpretation difficult, and\nsuggests further exploration is needed.\nThe perceived cultural norms of the UK South Asian\npopulation that overweight is acceptable, even desirable\n[54], may lead one to hypothesise that there would be\nno association between weight and body dissatisfaction\nin these children, but this does not appear to be the\ncase. The findings of this study demonstrate that the\nassociation exists, and this is consistent with other\nresearch. A stronger association between body fat and\nbody dissatisfaction was found in UK South Asian ado-\nlescents, compared to black African Caribbeans and\nwhites [19], and a further study found a desire for thin-\nness in preadolescent British Asian and Caucasian girls\nto be comparable [55].\nAlthough not the main focus of the study, an interest-\ning finding is the large proportion of children who had\nBDS scores which imply that they perceive themselves\nas too thin (37%), when less than 3% are underweight.\nThis merits further exploration as this finding may also\nhave implications in terms of obesity intervention.\nThe findings of this study add to the existing body of\nknowledge on weight status and body image for a number\nof reasons. Firstly, this is the largest study to explore the\nassociation in such a young age group, and to include\nboth sexes. The study has also focused on a large immi-\ngrant group in the UK that is known to be at risk of obe-\nsity and its health consequences [48]. Attempting to\nunderstand the psychosocial functioning in South Asian\nchildren in relation to obesity is crucial when developing\ninterventions to reduce obesity in this group. This\nbecomes especially important if one considers the poten-\ntial conflicting family, community and wider societal influ-\nences on South Asian children. We have also begun to\nexplore the differences in weight status and body image in\nthe different South Asian subgroups, and again, it is\nimportant in obesity intervention planning that South\nAsians are not regarded as one homogeneous group.\nThis study has several limitations. The study popula-\ntion was predominantly South Asian and the vast major-\nity were from households in areas of deprivation. This\nmade it difficult to study the influences of ethnicity and\nsocioeconomic status on body dissatisfaction and its\nrelationship with overweight and obesity, and the study\ncould have been improved by adding both white and\nblack comparator groups, and having subjects from\nacross the socioeconomic spectrum. The response rate\nfor the study was 53%, and it is possible that the non-\nrespondents\u2019 characteristics differed from respondents\u2019,\nfor example, parents of more overweight children may\nbe less likely to consent to their child participating in\nthis study. However, the weight distribution of the sam-\nple population was similar to that reported for Birming-\nham as a whole, which makes such bias less likely.\nAnother limitation is the use of the adapted Collins Fig-\nure Rating scale to assess body image. The reliability\nand validity of the instrument has only been demon-\nstrated in children aged 6 or over, whereas around one\nfifth of the sample population were aged 5 at the time\nof the study. The findings therefore have to be inter-\npreted with this in mind. In terms of assessing body dis-\nsatisfaction, it is the discrepancy between the child\u2019s\nperception of themselves and their perceived ideal that\nis of interest, and so reliability is of greater importance\nthan how their perceived self relates to their actual body\nsize. Finally, the derivation of body dissatisfaction in this\nstudy makes the assumption that a child is dissatisfied\nwith their body if their chosen ideal figure differs from\ntheir perceived self. This is not necessarily the case and\nchildren may have range of body shapes that they find\nsocially acceptable, as demonstrated by Rand and\nResnick [51].\nConclusions\nThe findings of this study support the idea that even at\na young age children have some awareness of their body\nsize and of some societal norms, with more overweight\nchildren experiencing higher body dissatisfaction and a\ndesire to be thinner. This raises questions as to whether\nchildren as young as 5 are subject to societal influences\nsuch as the media [56] that portray the thin ideal. In\nSouth Asian children, matters are further complicated as\nthese pervasive influences may create conflict with tradi-\ntional family and community values. Areas for future\nresearch include an exploration of the longitudinal rela-\ntionship between body image and dissatisfaction and\nfuture weight status in order to determine whether\naccuracy of weight perception or body dissatisfaction are\npotential predictors of weight change. Given the difficul-\nties in assessing body image in young children, more\nwork also needs to be done on developing valid and reli-\nable measures for use in very young children.\nThese findings have potential implications for child-\nhood obesity intervention. If overweight and obesity\nleads to higher levels of body dissatisfaction in young\nPallan et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11:21\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/11\/21\nPage 6 of 8\nchildren, as this study suggests, all components of inter-\nvention programmes aimed at reducing obesity in\nyounger children should take this into account, and\nshould be designed with sensitivity towards this issue.\nThose developing obesity interventions that target UK\nSouth Asian children need to pay particular attention to\nthe psychosocial functioning of these children and the\npossible internal conflicts they may face. With this\napproach, interventions will minimise potential harm to\nchildren and will be beneficial, not only in terms of redu-\ncing obesity, but also by maximising psychosocial health.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Birmingham healthy Eating, Active lifestyle for Children Study (BEACHeS)\nis funded by the National Prevention Research Initiative (NPRI, http:\/\/www.\nnpri.org.uk) and we are grateful to all the funding partners for their support:\nBritish Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UK; Department of Health;\nDiabetes UK; Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research\nCouncil; Research and Development Office for the Northern Ireland Health\nand Social Services; Chief Scientist Office, Scottish Executive Health\nDepartment; Welsh Assembly Government and World Cancer Research Fund.\nThe investigator and collaborative team include: The University of\nBirmingham: P Adab (PI), T Barratt, KK Cheng, A Daley, J Duda, P Gill, M\nPallan, J Parry; The Nutritional Epidemiology Group at the University of\nLeeds: J Cade; The MRC Epidemiology Unit, Cambridge: U Ekelund; The\nUniversity of Edinburgh: R Bhopal; Birmingham City Council: S Passmore;\nHeart of Birmingham PCT: M Howard; Birmingham Community Nutrition and\nDietetic Service: E McGee.
