Doi: 10.1007\/s12024-007-0013-6Metadata only entryForensic engineering is the application of engineering principles or techniques to the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not perform as intended. In particular, forensic engineering can involve providing solutions to forensic problems by the application of engineering science. A criminal aspect may be involved in the investigation but often the problems are related to negligence, breach of contract, or providing information needed in the redesign of a product to eliminate future failures. Forensic engineering may include the investigation of the physical causes of accidents or other sources of claims and litigation (for example, patent disputes). It involves the preparation of technical engineering reports, and may require giving testimony and providing advice to assist in the resolution of disputes affecting life or property. \\ud\nThis paper reviews the principal methods available for the analysis of failed components and then gives examples of different component failure modes through selected case studies","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Humana Press (Springer Imprint)","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/9024<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2011-02-01T14:38:12Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_171<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_835<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nForensic engineering: applying materials and mechanics principles to the investigation of product failures<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nHainsworth, Sarah V.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nFitzpatrick, M.E.<\/dc:creator><dc:description>\nThis paper was published as Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology, 2007, 3 (2), pp. 81-92.
