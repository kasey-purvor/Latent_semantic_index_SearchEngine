INTRODUCTION\nThe rare-earth region, with many well-deformed and\ntransitional nuclei, is an ideal venue for the study of the\norigins of deformation and collective motion. A number of\ncollective modes and quadrupole excitations can form 0+\nstates. Probably because of this, such states are often complex\nand remain poorly understood. Recently, 0+ excitations have\nattracted new attention. An experiment [1] measuring 0+ states\nin 158Gd by way of the (p, t) transfer reaction discovered\nseven new 0+ states and confirmed six previously known\nbelow an excitation energy of 3.1 MeV. This was the first\nobservation of such a large number of excited 0+ states\nin a deformed nucleus. Experiments involving other nuclei,\nsuch as those in the actinide [2] and rare-earth regions,\ncan show whether such a large number of 0+ excitations\nin this energy range is widespread or anomalous and can\nascertain the energy distribution of 0+ states along with\ntrends in those distributions with N and Z. In 232U, 230Th,\nand 228Th [2], several 0+ states were observed that had not\nbeen identified in previous experiments. Unexpectedly large\naccumulated transfer strengths, more than 60% of the strength\nof the ground state, were observed, emphasizing the need for\nmicroscopic calculations. With an empirical mapping of 0+\nstates in nuclei, the regional evolution with N and Z may\nbecome apparent, initial structural interpretation can begin,\nand theory will be challenged to account for these states. For\nexample, following the experimental observations in 158Gd,\ncalculations [3] reproduced the number of 0+ states. These\ncalculations and calculations like these have become a topic\nof much discussion [4,5].\nSimilar data for a large number of nuclei, spanning this\nmass region and exhibiting a variety of structures, will offer a\nmore thorough test of theory than a single nucleus. Therefore,\nwe examined 16 nuclei spanning the rare-earth region: 152Gd,\n154Gd, 158Gd (revisited), 162Dy, 168Er, 170Yb, 176Hf, 180W, 184W,\n190Os, 192Pt, 194Pt, 196Hg, 198Hg, 200Hg, and 202Hg. These\nnuclei have very different classifications (i.e., transitional,\ndeformed, \u03b3 -soft, and spherical) as indicated in Fig. 1. In\nchoosing structurally different nuclei, information about trends\nand types of possible 0+ excitations can be gained. This article\ndiscusses results for 152Gd, 154Gd, 162Dy, 168Er, 176Hf, 180W,\n184W, and 190Os and includes those of Ref. [1] for 158Gd.\nII. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS\nThis series of (p, t) experiments was performed at the\nUniversity of Munich MP tandem accelerator laboratory using\nthe Q3D [6] magnetic spectrograph. A beam of 25 MeV\nunpolarized protons was incident on 16 different isotopically\nenriched targets, and outgoing tritons were measured at\nlaboratory angles of 5\u25e6, 17.5\u25e6, and 30\u25e6 with respect to the\nbeam axis. The spectrograph is an ideal instrument for the\nmeasurement of transfer reaction products. The 1-m-long\nfocal plane detector [7] has 4\u20136 keV resolution for 15- to\n20-MeV tritons. With such fine resolution and little or no\nbackground, very clean cross section measurements down to\na few \u00b5b\/sr were possible. Typical spectra obtained at 5\u25e6 from\n192Os (p, t)190Os, 178Hf (p, t)176Hf, and 154Gd (p, t)152Gd\nare shown in Fig. 2. We collected data for each target up\nto \u223c3 MeV in excitation energy by taking two consecutive\n0556-2813\/2006\/74(4)\/044309(12) 044309-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nD. A.

(A small overlapping portion of the energy range was\nmeasured in both spectra.) After normalization to beam current\non target, we can effectively combine the two spectra to\ngive one continuous spectrum up to \u223c3 MeV. Spectra were\nanalyzed using RADWARE [8], and energy calibrations were\nconstructed using known levels in each nucleus. Peaks arising\nfrom target impurities were identified using the Q values of\npossible reactions and information about the targets\u2019 isotopic\ncomposition.\nSpin-parity values of 0+ states were assigned using the\ntriton angular distributions. 0+ states can be easily selected\nfrom other states because the L = 0 transfer angular distribu-\ntion peaks strongly at forward angles. We compared relative\ncross sections to those predicted by the distorted-wave Born\napproximation (DWBA) using the CHUCK3 code [9]. The\nvalues for the real and imaginary potentials used in the DWBA\ncalculations were obtained according to Ref. [10].\n0+ states were identified based primarily on the drop in\nrelative cross section between 5\u25e6 and 17.5\u25e6. This drop can be\ndramatic\u2014more than an order of magnitude\u2014and is unique\nto L = 0 transfers. In contrast, as seen in Fig. 3, angular\ndistributions for higher spins peak at more backward angles.\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n0\n40\n80\n120\n energy (keV)\n152Gd\n162Dy\n190Os\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n0\n40\n80\n120\n \nco\nu\nn\nts\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n0\n40\n80\n120\nFIG. 2. Typical (p, t) spectra obtained at 5\u25e6.\nCoupled-channel effects impact cross sections primarily at\nlarge angles and can alter L \u0003= 0 angular distributions. How-\never, for L = 0 cases, the main effect is only to moderately\nmodify the cross sections at 17.5\u25e6 and 30\u25e6. This has little effect\non the forward peak for L = 0 transfer, which is therefore a\nrobust empirical signature. Note that although the magnitudes\nof the predicted DWBA cross sections as well as the location\nof the minima can vary with the neutron orbital chosen for\nthe calculations, given the N and Z of the target and the Q\nvalue, it is a minor effect for L = 0 transfer. To elaborate on\nthe angular distributions, 0+ states assigned in this work for\n154Gd, 176Hf, and 190Os are shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6 with\ntheir corresponding DWBA predictions.\nFigure 7 shows the initial drop in cross section for 0+ states\nand the different behavior of the first 2+ and 4+ states of the\nground and \u03b3 bands by plotting the ratio of the cross sections\nat 5\u25e6 and 17.5\u25e6 versus the ratio of the cross sections at 17.5\u25e6\nand 30\u25e6. The ratio of the cross sections between 5\u25e6 and 17.5\u25e6\nis large (as high as \u223c60) for L = 0 transfer, whereas it is\ngenerally less than 3 for known 2+ and 4+ states of the ground\nand \u03b3 bands. In most cases, the cross-section ratio between\n17.5\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 is greater than \u223c1 for known L = 2 transfers,\ngreater than 0.5 for knownL = 4 transfers, and less than 0.5 for\nknown L = 0 cases (known 0+ states). This does not provide\na clean separation of the 0+ states from 2+ and 4+ states and,\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n1\n2\n3\nL = 2\nL = 4\nL = 0\ncr\no\nss\n s\ne\nct\nio\nn \n(ar\nbit\nrar\ny u\nnit\ns)\nangle (degrees)\nFIG. 3.

Angular distributions for observed 0+ states in 154Gd. Data (points) are compared to DWBA calculations (line). The DWBA\ncalculations for L = 0 transfers are normalized to the data at 5\u25e6.\ntherefore, emphasis was placed on the drop in cross section\nbetween 5\u25e6 and 17.5\u25e6 when making 0+ assignments.\nCoupled-channel effects can affect L = 0 transfer only\nif the 5\u25e6 cross sections are very small. Then, at 17.5\u25e6,\nwhere the direct cross section is even smaller for 0+ states,\nthe contribution from coupled-channel effects will nearly\nalways raise the measured cross section, reducing the ratio\n\u03c3 (5o)\/\u03c3 (17.5o). We see this effect in Fig. 8, which shows the\nratio of the cross sections at 5\u25e6 and 17.5\u25e6 against the cross\nsection at 5\u25e6. Low ratios are clearly associated with small\nabsolute cross sections, as seen in the magnified view on the\nright. Not surprisingly, therefore, the majority of the tentatively\nassigned 0+ states\u2014tentative because of a smaller drop in cross\nsection between 5\u25e6 and 17.5\u25e6 \u2014also have small absolute cross\nsections. (The three exceptions are the states at 967.4 keV in\n176Hf, 774.2 keV in 162Dy, and 1865.6 keV in 176Hf. The first\ntwo are tentative assignments based on their extremely low\nexcitation energies. The latter is tentatively assigned because\nalthough it exhibits a large drop in cross section between 5\u25e6\nand 17.5\u25e6, its angular distribution does not fit the DWBA\ncalculation very well.)\nIn the nuclei discussed here, a total of ninety-nine 0+\nstates were assigned: 70 of these are new, and 22 of these\nare tentative. (These data are slightly updated from those in\nRef. [11] due to further investigation of 168Er [12].) A number\nof other states with rather small ratios of cross sections between\n5\u25e6 and 17.5\u25e6 were known to correspond to J \u0003= 0+ states.

The data are collected in Fig. 9. It is interesting\nto look for possible trends across such a broad range of\nnuclei. Aside from the large number of 0+ states discovered,\ntheir distribution as a function of excitation energy and their\nstrengths relative to the ground state vary considerably from\nnucleus to nucleus as shown in the figure. For instance, 158Gd\nand 180W have a fairly even distribution of 0+ states, whereas\n162Dy appears to have fewer low-lying 0+ states and clusters of\n0+ states at higher energies. Startling variations in the number\nand distribution of 0+ states are apparent when comparing,\nfor example, 184W and 190Os or 180W and 184W, which differ\nby only four valence neutrons. These variations alone suggest\nnoncollective origins for many of these states.\nSome of the 0+ states occur at energies as low as\n\u223c1200 keV, well below the pairing gaps in these nuclei. The\nnumber and variations in the number of 0+ states below the\npairing gap is especially interesting: as high as 10 excited 0+\nstates in 154Gd (see discussion below) but relatively constant\nat \u223c5 among the other nuclei.\nTo further pursue the possible collective nature of some of\nthese states, we note that collective 0+ states can be formed by\nthe antialigned superposition of two-phonon excitations, such\nas the \u03b3 vibration or octupole modes or by combining two K =\n0+ excitations [14]. The locations of two-phonon excitations,\nestimated by doubling the energy of the one-phonon states\nwithout regard for anharmonicity, and of known single-phonon\nmodes with J = 0+, are compared to the excitation energies\nof the observed 0+ states in Fig. 9. Notice that there are many\n0+ states below any harmonic double-phonon excitations. For\nexample, in 158Gd, there are seven 0+ states below the lowest\nestimated harmonic double-phonon excitation, and in 184W\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0 0 keV\ncr\no\nss\n s\ne\nct\nio\nn \n(m\nb\/s\nr)\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.000\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006 967.4 keV\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.00\n0.04\n0.08\n0.12 1150.1 keV\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.000\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n1196.7 keV\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10 1293.3 keV\ncr\no\nss\n s\ne\nct\nio\nn \n(m\nb\/s\nr)\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.0000\n0.0002\n0.0004\n0.0006\n0.0008\n0.0010\n1499.2 keV\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08 1746.3 keV\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.0000\n0.0004\n0.0008\n0.0012\nangle (degrees)\n1865.6 keV\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.000\n0.004\n0.008\n0.012\nangle (degrees)\n2340.4 keV\ncr\no\nss\n s\ne\nct\nio\nn \n(m\nb\/s\nr)\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.000\n0.005\n0.010\n0.015\n0.020\n0.025\nangle (degrees)\n2445.2 keV\n5 10 15 20 25 30\n0.000\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\nangle (degrees)\n2489.8 keV\nFIG. 5.

When octupole degrees of\nfreedom were incorporated into realistic calculations using\nthe spdf-IBA [15], the number of 0+ states predicted below\n3 MeV in 158Gd is nearly the number observed. If these states\ncan indeed be explained in terms of double octupole phonons,\nthen only a few of the 0+ states in this energy region are largely\ntwo quasiparticle in nature. Another way of looking at this\nis to note that, frequently, there are a number of 0+ states\nbelow the pairing gap (dashed vertical lines in Fig. 9). We\nreturn to this point later.\nThe possible double-phonon nature can be explored by\nlooking at known \u03b3 decay from 0+ states. However, very little\ndata of this type are available [16]. Experiments to study the\n\u03b3 -ray decay from 0+ states, particularly branching ratios and\nE1 decays to low-lying negative parity states, are needed to\nfurther explore this hypothesis. In one case, the strong decay\nof the band built on the 0+ state at 1400 keV in 162Dy [17] to\nthe \u03b3 band suggests this state has a significant amplitude for a\ndouble \u03b3 vibration. The 2+ state in this band lies at 1453.5 keV,\ndecaying to the 4+ states of the ground and \u03b3 bands with\ntransitions of 1187.8 and 392.5 keV, respectively. The relative\nintensities of these two transitions are 12.7 and 0.18. The\nvalue for the square of the reduced matrix element for decay\nto the \u03b3 band is 10 times larger than that for decay to the\nground band. In this case, the actual double phonon lies\n500 keV below the harmonic estimate, showing that compari-\nson to these double-phonon estimates should be taken only as a\nstarting point for further investigation and that anharmonicities\nare important.\nIn all cases except 152Gd, the cross section is dominated\nby the ground state. Any cross section greater than 10%\nof the ground state is rare and points to some particular\n044309-7\nD. A. MEYER et al.

For\nexample, shape coexistence in 150Sm and 152Sm [19] yields\nstrong cross sections for excited 0+ states. The cross section\nfrom the deformed 152Sm ground state to a deformed excited\nstate in 150Sm is enhanced, whereas the cross section to the\nmore spherical ground state of 150Sm is reduced. Similarly,\nthe ground states of even-even Gd isotopes with A\u0001 154 are\ndeformed, whereas the ground states of even-even Gd isotopes\nwith A < 154 are spherical. Spherical and deformed shapes\ncoexist in 152Gd and 154Gd [20]. An enhanced cross section\nfrom the deformed 154Gd ground state to a deformed excited\nstate in 152Gd is observed. Note that the sum of cross sections\n(at 5\u25e6) of the ground state (0.91 mb\/sr) and first excited 0+\nstate (1.08 mb\/sr) in 152Gd is similar to that of the ground state\nfor neighboring nuclei (e.g., 2.37 mb\/sr for the ground state\nof 154Gd). Detailed microscopic calculations could provide\ninsight into observed cross sections as shape coexistence in\ncertain nuclei cannot account for all of the large cross sections.\nAs seen in Fig. 10, many nuclei have states around 1500 keV\nwith large cross sections. These large cross sections occur\nbelow the pairing gap in these nuclei, suggesting some degree\nof collectivity for these states. In 168Er, unique among the\nnuclei studied, there are no large cross sections near 1.5 MeV\nbut rather there are significant cross sections near 3 MeV.\nThere is no current explanation for the strength of these cross\nsections.\nFollowing the publication of the data obtained for 158Gd [1],\ncalculations [3] reproduced the number and energies of the\nobserved 0+ states fairly well. Similar calculations for 168Er [5]\nalso give a reasonable account of the number and energies\nof the 0+ states in that nucleus. The present data for these\nadditional nuclei, with variations in number, excitation energy,\nand cross sections for the 0+ states, provide a much more\nstringent test of potential theories. A particular challenge lies\nin understanding the significant variations with few obvious\ntrends exhibited by the experimental results for nuclei across\nthis region.\nWe return to the number of 0+ states and discuss further\nthe role of phase transitional behavior in the number of\n0+ states observed. Figure 11 shows a histogram of the number\nof definite 0+ assignments versus excitation energy for these\nnuclei. We can easily distinguish 154Gd from the other nuclei\nby the steeper increase in the number of 0+ states and the\nlarger number of 0+ states below 3 MeV.

There is a marked increase in the number of 0+ states at\nlow energies in 154Gd, distinguishing it from the others. (This figure\nis similar to Fig. 4 in Ref. [11] but reflects updated data available for\n168Er according to Ref. [12].)\ncollective model calculations [21\u201323] predict a minimum in\nthe energy of the lowest excited 0+ state in the transition region\nthat is also observed here (see 152,154Gd in Fig. 9).\nThe behavior of collective 0+ states near first-order phase\ntransitions has been examined in a series of calculations [24]\nusing the Ising-type IBA Hamiltonian [25] of the consistent Q\nformalism (CQF) [26]:\nH = \u03ba[(\u0004\/\u03ba)nd \u2212 Q \u00b7 Q] = \u03b1\n[\n\u03b7nd \u2212\n(\n\u03b7 \u2212 1\nN\n)\nQ \u00b7 Q\n]\n,\n(1)\nwhere\nQ = (s\u2020 \u02dcd + d\u2020s) + \u03c7 (d\u2020 \u02dcd), (2)\nwhere \u03c7 ranges from zero for \u03b3 -soft nuclei to \u2212\u221a7\/2 for\nSU(3). In these calculations, the regime from spherical to\ndeformed is expressed primarily by the parameter \u03b7, where\n\u03b7 = 0 indicates a rotor, \u03b7 = 1 indicates a vibrator, and \u03b7 \u223c 0.8\nindicates the transition point for large boson number. The\nresults of the calculations of Ref. [24], shown in Fig. 12,\nreveal both a marked descent of the energy of the first excited\n0+ state and a compression in energy of all excited 0+\nstates. The calculations indicate the largest energy density\nof low-lying 0+ states should occur in the transition region.\nThese calculations have been carried out using very high\nboson numbers to highlight the phase-transitional effects.\n044309-9\nD.

(Top) Schematic IBA calculations using 30 bosons show\na marked increase in the density of 0+ states in the phase-transitional\nregion. (Bottom) The number of experimentally observed 0+ states,\nplotted versus their calculated \u03b7 values, mirrors the increased density.\n(This figure is similar to Fig. 1 in Ref. [11] but reflects updated data\navailable for 168Er according to Ref. [12].)\nHowever, the increased level density in the phase-transitional\nregion persists for lower boson numbers. As pointed out in\nFig. 11, 154Gd is easily distinguished from the other nuclei by\nits excess of 0+ states, particularly in the energy range from\n1.5 to 2.5 MeV. 154Gd has an R4\/2 value of 3.02, at the critical\npoint of the first-order spherical-deformed phase transition\nnear A = 150 [27]. This enhanced density of observed low-\nlying 0+ states near the phase-transitional point is the first\ncorroboration of this basic characteristic of a first-order phase\ntransition [11].\nBecause the calculations shown in the top part of Fig. 12\nare schematic, we turn to more realistic calculations pre-\nsented in two ways. First, many of the nuclei in this study\nhave previously been fit [21] with the IBA using the same\nHamiltonian discussed above. The number of observed 0+\nstates for each nucleus at the fitted \u03b7 value is shown in the\nbottom part of Fig. 12. The nuclei 180,184W were not included\nin Ref. [21] but have been separately fit [28]: the parameters for\n180,184W are \u03b7 = 0.56 and 0.52, respectively, and \u03c7 = \u22120.58\nand \u22120.55, respectively. The predicted increase in the number\nof 0+ states at low energies at the phase-transitional point is\napparent.\nIn a second approach, also using Eq. (1), calculations have\nbeen carried out for a range of parameter values \u03b5\/\u03ba and \u03c7\nfor realistic boson numbers NB = 6 \u2212 16. Each calculation\nreproduces typical values of E(2+) and the general behavior\nof intrinsic excitations (e.g., the \u03b3 band) in the rare-earth\nregion. The numbers of low-lying 0+ states from these\ncalculations for selected R4\/2 values between vibrator and\nrotor are shown in Fig. 13(a), and we again see the increase\nat the phase-transition point. However, the sd-IBA predicts far\nfewer states than are observed experimentally.

(b) The number of\nobserved 0+ states below the pairing gap (determined from odd-even\nmass differences) is shown as a function of R4\/2. There are nearly\ntwice as many excited 0+ states in 154Gd below the pairing gap\nas in any of the other nuclei. (This figure is similar to Fig. 5 in\nRef. [11] but reflects updated data available for 168Er according to\nRef. [12].)\nincorporating negative parity p and f bosons yield a more\nrealistic number of states in this energy region in the case\nof 158Gd [15]. Although the experimentally observed states\nare likely to include quasiparticle excitations that mix with\ncollective excitations, it is interesting to carry out simple spdf-\nIBA calculations [29] across the range of nuclei from spherical\nto deformed. To keep the number of additional parameters to\na minimum, the p and f boson energies were kept constant at\nvalues that reproduce typical negative parity excitations, and\ncalculations were restricted to the U(5) to SU(3) leg of the\nsymmetry triangle. The number of predicted 0+ states are also\nincluded in Fig. 13(a). Naturally, these calculations exhibit\nmany more 0+ states, closer in number to the experimental\nobservations, and preserve a clear peaking near the phase\ntransition.\nThe data reflect the increased energy density of 0+ states\nnear the phase-transitional region. To focus on states more\nlikely to be collective, Fig. 13(b) shows the number of excited\n0+ states below the pairing gap in each nucleus, plotted against\nR4\/2. The increase in the number of 0+ states in the transitional\nregion is again observed.\nObservation of the large number of 0+ states found in\nthis study offers another perspective on structure as well,\nnamely the possibility of an analysis in terms of the ordered\nor chaotic (mixed) nature of the energy spectra in these nuclei.\nInformation about the degree of mixing of nuclear levels\n044309-10\nEXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION OF 0+ STATES IN . . .

Because the statistics for one\nnucleus are very limited, we have fit the Brody distributions\nto the entire set of nearest neighbor spacings from the nuclei\nin this work using a standard unfolding method [31,32]. First,\na quadratic function was fit to the histogram plot for each\nnucleus individually in Fig. 11. Then, for each observed level,\nthe value of the fit function was used to generate a spacing\ndistribution, Neff , as illustrated in Fig. 14. Notice that small\nenergy spacings correspond to small spacings in Neff . The Neff\ndistribution was then binned and the resulting distribution of\nspacings was fit by the Brody distribution for different values\nof \u03c9. The distribution of this new \u201caveraged\u201d set of energy\nlevels is compared with Brody distributions for \u03c9 = 0.3, 0.6,\nand 0.9 in Fig. 15. Although the statistics are limited so that\none cannot determine a precise value of \u03c9, values near 0.6\nseem to provide a reasonable fit. This suggests that the 0+\nlevel spectrum is intermediate between ordered and chaotic\nin structure, providing another means of assessing future\nmicroscopic calculations.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe present data more than double the number of 0+ states\npreviously known, and the variations in these data give rise\nto many questions. The number and excitation energy of 0+\nstates varies considerably between nuclei. Even neighboring\nnuclei are quite different from each other, possibly indicating\nvariations in the energies of noncollective states. However,\noften a large number of 0+ states lie below the pairing gap and\nseveral occur as low in energy as \u223c1200 keV. Many more 0+\nstates exist than can be accounted with a simple estimation\nof the number and energies of double phonon excitations,\nbut a more realistic estimate of the number of states can\nbe made using the spdf-IBA. We also observe differences in\nthe relative cross sections of the states. Some, such as those\nin the Gd isotopes, can be explained by phase-transitional\nbehavior, but the trend of large cross sections around 1.5 MeV\nin most nuclei and around 3 MeV in 168Er is intriguing. The\nnumber of low-lying 0+ states peaks in the transition region\nwhere spherical and deformed states coexist in agreement with\nrobust predictions of collective models. A statistical analysis\nof the distribution of 0+ energies using the Brody distribution\nfunction suggests that the spectrum of these excitations is\nintermediate between ordered and chaotic in character. The\nvariations in these data on 0+ states provide a challenge to\nexisting theories.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge helpful discussions with N. Lo Iudice, the\nhelp of Y.
