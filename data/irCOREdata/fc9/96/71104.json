Simultaneous measurements from the Cluster\nspacecraft and several ground stations (SAMNET, IMAGE,\nKakioka, Hermanus) provide evidence for an association of\nPi2 pulsations and pulsed reconnection in the magnetotail.\nOn 8 September 2002, substorm-related Pi2 pulsations were\nrecorded with the same waveform (same frequency) in the\ntail lobe at 16RE and time-delayed on the ground (both\nnightside and dayside) spanning L values from 1.23 to 6.11.\nThe tail lobe Pi2 pulsations were a series of nightside flux\ntransfer event (NFTE) pulses propagating at a speed of 600\u2013\n800 km\/s towards Earth, which for the first time relates these\ntwo magnetospheric phenomena. NFTEs have previously\nbeen considered as the remote signature of tail reconnection.\nThe first ground onset of the Pi2 pulsations occurred at high-\nand midlatitude ground stations with a time delay of \u223c30 s\nwith respect to the tail lobe Pi2, followed by lower latitude\nground stations. The largest pulsations were observed at high\nlatitude (ten times larger than at low latitude) near the polar\ncap boundary. The polarization pattern of the ground Pi2s\nin the H-D plane was consistent with a periodically driven\nfield-aligned current (FAC) system. In addition, fast mode\nwaves must have also played a role in the inner magneto-\nsphere because of propagation effects among ground stations\nand because of the simultaneous occurrence of dayside low-\nlatitude Pi2. Auroral brightening occurred in the region of\nupflowing FAC, and the auroral electrojet expanded poleward\ntogether with the auroral bulge both of which are typical sub-\nstorm signatures. Hence, we conclude that the substorm-\nrelated Pi2 pulsations in space at 16RE and on the ground\nwere remotely driven by pulsed reconnection in the magne-\nCorrespondence to: A. Keiling\n(keiling@ssl.berkeley.edu)\ntotail, that is, reconnection not only provided the energy but\nits temporal variations also determined the characteristic Pi2\nfrequency. Scenarios are discussed that address the connec-\ntion of pulsed reconnection and the driven current system in\nthe ionosphere. These results show that reconnection can be\ncoupled to the ionosphere through what is phenomenologi-\ncally known as Pi2 pulsations. As a corollary, it is shown\nthat the time history of events fits within the modified NENL\nmodel of substorms.\nKeywords. Magnetospheric physics (Magnetosphere-\nionosphere interactions; Storms and substorms; MHD waves\nand instabilities)\n1 Introduction\nMuch progress has been made in explaining the generation of\nPi2 pulsations (see review by Olson, 1999). It has been estab-\nlished that there are observational differences between Pi2s\noccurring at higher latitudes and those occurring at midlati-\ntudes and low-latitudes; typically the frequency is lower and\nthe amplitude larger for high-latitude Pi2s. It is thus widely\nagreed upon that different mechanisms generate Pi2s. It is\nimportant to note that there is a difference between energy\nprovider and frequency driver for Pi2s. In some scenarios,\nthe energy provider not only provides the energy but also\ndictates the characteristic Pi2 frequency which lies between\n7\u201325 mHz (40\u2013150 s period). In others, the energy provider\nonly provides the energy and the Pi2 frequency is established\nlater by a separate process.\nClearly, one can trace the energy source for Pi2 pulsations\nback to the Sun but here we refer to the more immediate\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3434 A.

There is general agreement that the en-\nergy for substorm-related Pi2 \u2013 regardless of the Pi2 model \u2013\ncomes from an energy release process occurring in the mag-\nnetotail. It is, on the other hand, more uncertain where the\nsource is located, how the released energy travels from the\nsource to the ground, what energy transfer processes occur\nalong the way, and where and how the Pi2 frequency is es-\ntablished. Different energy paths result in different types of\nPi2s. In one scenario plasma flow released in the magneto-\ntail (possibly during reconnection) propagates towards Earth\nand eventually is slowed down at the transition region be-\ntween tail-like and dipole-like field lines (Shiokawa et al.,\n1997). This \u201cbraking\u201d can result in two subsequent scenarios\nyielding two physically different types of Pi2. First, it is pro-\nposed that the braking leads to a diversion of the cross-tail\ncurrent into field-aligned currents (Birn et al., 1999). This\ninitially launches an Alfve\u00b4n wave towards Earth which un-\nder the right conditions partially reflects off the ionosphere.\nThe resulting reflection then leads to a \u201cringing\u201d of the flux\ntubes at the Pi2 frequency (see review by Baumjohann and\nGlassmeier, 1984, and references therein). Alternatively, it is\nargued that the braking can launch a compressional pulse to-\nward Earth which is broadband in frequency. This broadband\nwave excites a cavity resonance in the inner magnetosphere\nwith an eigenfrequency that lies in the Pi2 range (e.g., Sut-\ncliffe and Yumoto, 1989; Takahashi et al., 1995; Allan et al.,\n1996). These two scenarios illustrate how the energy path\ntaken from the magnetotail toward the Earth can be different\nand also how the characteristic Pi2 frequency can be estab-\nlished in different ways.\nAnother scenario is based on the observation that fast\nplasma flows in the plasma sheet showed velocity wave-\nforms and periodicities which matched those of time-delayed\nground Pi2s (Kepko and Kivelson, 1999; Kepko et al., 2001).\nIn this scenario the Pi2 frequency is established by the peri-\nodicity of plasma flow. It was further proposed that the en-\nergy contained in each fast flow is transferred and guided to\nthe ground in possibly different ways.\nThere is good observational evidence that these differ-\nent mechanisms (mentioned above) operate in the magneto-\nsphere. The goal of this paper is to establish another source\nthat produces the characteristic Pi2 frequency, namely pulsed\nreconnection in the magnetotail, which might be (or might\nnot be) related to the inertial current Pi2 model proposed\nby Kepko et al. (2001). Magnetic reconnection changes the\ntopology of magnetic fields and allows solar wind energy to\nenter the magnetosphere. The detailed processes responsible\nfor reconnection, including its time-varying behavior, are not\nyet fully known.\nThe Pi2 event presented here occurred on 8 September\n2002. The substorm surrounding this Pi2 event has been pre-\nviously studied with regard to the transition from the growth\nto the expansion phase (Sergeev et al., 2005). We will make\nuse of some of their findings in this paper by applying them\nto the analysis of the Pi2 phenomenon. Our approach will\nbe as follows. First, we will establish that on 8 September\n2002, Pi2 pulsations occurred on the ground covering low-\nto high latitudes (both nightside and dayside) in association\nwith a substorm. Second, we will show that a Pi2 signature\nwas also present in the tail lobe at 16RE using Cluster data.\nUsing the analyses from Sergeev et al. (2005) and Semenov\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3433\u20133449, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/\nA. Keiling et al.: Association of Pi2 pulsations and pulsed reconnection 3435\net al. (2005), these space Pi2s are identified as the remote sig-\nnature of reconnection possibly occurring at \u223c30RE . Third,\nwe will show that tail lobe Pi2 and ground Pi2 had the same\nwaveforms and frequency but occurred at slightly different\ntimes. Fourth, using timing analysis, we will rule out previ-\nous Pi2 scenarios and will conclude that pulsed reconnection\nwas both the energy provider and the frequency driver for\nthe ground Pi2s. Fifth, we will speculate on how the Pi2\ndisturbances propagated from the reconnection region to the\nground. Finally, this study will also address the outstanding\nquestion of the time history of events during the development\nof a substorm. Here we will use Pi2 pulsations as a \u201cmarker\u201d\nto follow the development.\nThe observations presented here are from the satellites\nCluster, Polar, Geotail, and IMAGE, and the Sub-Auroral\nMagnetometer Network (SAMNET) and the International\nMonitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Effects (IMAGE), the\nHermanus ground observatory in South Africa, and the\nKakioka ground station in Japan. SAMNET, IMAGE and\nHermanus are located within the same 3-h MLT sector;\nKakioka station is located \u223c9 h to the east of these stations\nand was in the dayside during this event (Fig. 1a).\n2 Overview\nOn 8 September 2002, Pi2 pulsations were recorded at about\nX= \u201316RE (GSM) in the Northern Hemisphere (Z \u223c2.5RE\nGSM) by the four Cluster spacecraft. Figure 2a shows the\nBz (GSM) magnetic field component of Cluster 1. The ion\ndensity and the ion energy-time spectrogram (Figs. 2b and c)\nshow that Cluster 1 was in the tail lobe at the time of the\nPi2 observation. Cluster 1 left the plasma sheet at about\n21:05 UT and remained on tail lobe field lines until 21:45 UT\nwhen it briefly reentered the plasma sheet. The ion signa-\nture (\u223c200 eV) in the tail lobe indicates outflowing oxygen\nas confirmed with the mass spectrometer onboard Cluster 1\n(not shown).\nDuring the time of the space Pi2 pulsations, Cluster\u2019s mag-\nnetic footprints were in close proximity to the SAMNET and\nIMAGE magnetometer networks (Fig. 1b). Figures 2d and\ne show nightside unfiltered ground magnetograms of the H\ncomponent of a subset of ground stations covering high- to\nmidlatitudes. All ground stations show Pi2 pulsations with\nsome time delay with respect to Cluster\u2019s Pi2 which will be\nshown more clearly in the following sections. In Sect. 5, data\nfrom Kakioka ground station (located on the dayside flank\nduring this event) will be shown confirming that Pi2s also\noccurred in the dayside. The onset time of the ground Pi2 co-\nincided with the negative turning of theH component at KIL\nand OUL indicating that these Pi2 were substorm-related.\nAt the time of the Pi2 pulsations, auroral activity was\nrecorded in the far-ultraviolet spectrum (WIC instrument) by\nthe IMAGE satellite. Figures 3a through f show the devel-\nopment of the substorm. Cluster\u2019s footprint (star symbol in\nFig. 3b) was located in the polar cap region at the time of the\nauroral breakup, which is consistent with the Cluster in-situ\nmeasurements.\n3 Ground observations\n3.1 Ground Pi2\nThe high-pass-filtered (150 s) H component ground mag-\nnetic field data are shown in Fig. 4 with low- to high-latitude\nstations (L=1.83 to 6.11) approximately arranged from bot-\ntom to top. Note that the scales are different for different\npanels. All but one station (HER) are located in the North-\nern Hemisphere. Pi2 pulsations were recorded at all stations.\nWhereas high-latitude stations (L>4) show Pi2 amplitudes\nof up to 50 nT, the mid- to low-latitude stations (L<4) show\namplitudes of only a few nT. For example, the oscillations at\nKIL were 10 times larger than those at YOR. The first Pi2\n\u201cpulse\u201d occurred at the high- and midlatitude stations OUL,\nHAN, and NUR (first dashed line from the left). These sta-\ntions are closest to one another and located on similar merid-\nians (c.f. Fig. 1b). The first deflection of the pulse occurred\nat 21:17:10 UT and is here defined as the \u201cground Pi2 on-\nset.\u201d Starting at \u223c21:21 UT, all stations show very similar\nwaveforms with a frequency (period) of\u223c11 mHz (90 s) (see\ndashed lines) which we here call the \u201cmain Pi2 event\u201d.\nSmall phase shifts (tilted dashed lines in lower panels of\nFig. 4) can be seen among the six stations HER, HAD, YOR,\nESK, CRK, and LER which are located on similar meridians\nand 1 h (MLT) west of, for example, KVI and HAN. These\nphase shifts (or time delays) increase systematically with in-\ncreasing L value of the stations, suggesting that propagation\neffects might have been responsible. In contrast, the stations\nfrom BOR up to KIL do not show any significant phase shifts\n(vertical dashed lines). It is also noted that H and D (not\nshown) were out of phase at HER but were in phase at, for\nexample, YOR.\nSeveral\u223c180\u25e6 phase reversals were present in theH com-\nponent between high-latitude (L>4) ground stations (for ex-\nample, OUL and HLL). To investigate these phase reversals,\nFig. 5a shows a polarization map in the H\u2013D plane of the\nground Pi2 (from SAMNET ground stations) for the time in-\nterval 21:21\u201321:26 UT, which shows Pi2s (\u201cmain Pi2 event\u201d)\nat all stations. Blue (red) lines show clockwise (counter-\nclockwise) rotation of the polarization. The size of each po-\nlarization ellipse represents the magnetic field amplitude of\nthe oscillations. Several features are apparent in the polariza-\ntion map. The azimuths of most of the polarization ellipses\npoint towards a common location (see arrows). This Pi2 az-\nimuth pattern is similar to the one associated with a tran-\nsient wedge-like current system (Lester et al., 1984; Gelpi et\nal., 1987) where the azimuths point near an upward FAC. It\nis also noted that the largest ground oscillations (largest el-\nlipses) were located in the vicinity of this proposed upward\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/ Ann.

Furthermore,\nthe upward FAC coincided with the region of auroral bright-\nening (shaded area, see Sect. 3.2).\nFurther support for a FAC system comes from the polariza-\ntion reversals occurring at \u223c60\u25e6 and \u223c65\u25e6 latitude (Fig. 5a).\nThis double polarization change appears to be associated\nwith the FAC system and the region of auroral brighten-\ning. Such a double polarization change has been discussed\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3433\u20133449, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/\nA.

In their modeling (c.f.\ntheir Fig. 31), the westward traveling surge (WTS) would\ncoincide with the shaded area (Fig. 5a), and the dashed lines\nseparate regions with different polarization (\u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2013\u201d de-\nnote counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively). The\ndownward current maps north-east of the WTS and feeds the\nupward current in the WTS (Samson and Rostoker, 1983). A\ndownward current at \u223c120\u25e6 longitude can be inferred from\nthe longitudinal profile of H and D on 8 September 2002\n(not shown). Upward and downward FAC are commonly\nassociated with the field-aligned portion of the SCW. This\npossibility and others are discussed in Sect. 7.\nIn Sect. 5, when comparing ground and space Pi2s, data\nwill be shown from the low-latitude Kakioka (KAK) ground\nstation, which was in the dayside at the time of the nightside\nPi2s. Kakioka also recorded the same Pi2 pulsations, which\nagain suggests that fast mode waves must have played some\nrole in this Pi2 event, because fast mode waves can travel\nacross the background magnetic field.\nIn summary, there is a common Pi2 event (\u201cmain event\u201d)\nwhich was observed at low- to high-latitudes in the nightside\n(both hemispheres), and it was also observed in the dayside\nat low latitudes. Polarization, amplitude variations and time\ndelays of the Pi2s present a complex pattern which indicates\nthat the Pi2s were organized by a FAC current wedge but also\nthat fast mode waves must have played some role. The com-\nmon feature among all stations is the similar waveform (same\nfrequency) of the main Pi2 event. In Sects. 4 and 5 we will\nshed light on the driving source of this common frequency.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 3433\u20133449, 2006\n3438 A.

Note that the scales are\ndifferent for different panels.\n3.2 Auroral bulge\nThe first sign of change in auroral activity is discernable in\nFig. 3b (21:18:20 UT; the center time of integration is shown\nabove each image). Several faint structures formed along the\nauroral oval in the premidnight sector (19:00\u201324:00 MLT).\nThe largest of these structures, located at \u223c23.5 MLT and\n62\u25e6, had expanded poleward. This is the same location\nwhere the more dramatic intensification and expansion oc-\ncurred one image later (Fig. 3c) followed by a small west-\nward and more pronounced eastward expansion of the auro-\nral bulge (Figs. 3d, e, and f). It is noted that several images\nbefore 21:16:17 UT (Fig. 3a) are very similar to Fig. 3a, i.e.,\nthey show no signs of auroral activation. Thus, the weak\nexpansion in Fig. 3b could indeed be the first sign of the \u201cau-\nroral onset.\u201d Furthermore, the total auroral brightness inte-\ngrated over 2-h wide MLT sectors shows an increase in the\n22:00\u201324:00 MLT sector (red line in Fig. 3g) between the im-\nages taken at 21:16:17 and 21:18:20 UT (red dashed line in\nFig. 3g). Since the integration time of each image is 20 s, the\nauroral onset (first sign of an intensity increase and poleward\nexpansion) occurred between 21:16:27 and 21:18:30 UT. It is\nnoted, that this interval includes the onset time of the ground\nPi2 (21:17:10 UT) (Sect. 3.1) which could imply that the first\npulse and the first weak brightening are related. Alterna-\ntively, however, it could be argued that the auroral breakup\noccurred some time during 21:18:30 and 21:20:34 UT based\non (1) Fig. 3c which shows that of all developing auroral fea-\ntures in Fig. 3b only the one at \u223c23.5 MLT and 62\u25e6 further\nintensified and led to the auroral bulge, and (2) on the result\nof the next section where it is shown that the auroral elec-\ntrojet significantly intensified at 21:18:40 UT followed by a\nrapid poleward expansion.\nThe region of auroral brightening is generally assumed\nto be associated with an upward FAC. We have drawn this\nregion of auroral brightening in Fig. 5a (shaded area corre-\nsponds approximately to the outer green border in Fig. 3c),\nand it indeed encompasses the location of the upward FAC\nas estimated from the ground magnetic field data (Sect. 3.1),\nwhich is also the location of the largest ground Pi2 oscilla-\ntions. Thus, upward FAC, largest Pi2 pulsations and head of\nthe auroral bulge (WTS) are likely related in this event.\nFigure 5b shows the approximate location of the poleward\nauroral border (determined from Figs. 3a, b, and c) at differ-\nent times in relation to the SAMNET ground stations. Note\nthat the determination of this border was subjective because it\ndepends on the brightness criterion used in the WIC images.\nAt ground Pi2 onset (21:17:10 UT), this border was in close\nvicinity of OUL (dashed line labeled 21:16:17 UT) which\nwas one of the stations to first record the ground Pi2 and to\nfirst show the largest amplitudes. The station KIL, however,\nwas in the polar cap (i.e., outside the auroral oval) at this time\nand did not record large amplitude Pi2. Only when the pole-\nward border passed KIL during its expansion (dashed line\nlabeled 21:20:24 UT) did KIL record large (>10 nT) Pi2 os-\ncillations (top panel in Fig. 4). This is consistent with the\nscenario that the WTS was the cause of the large amplitude\nground Pi2 at high latitude.\n3.3 Auroral electrojet\nThe ground Pi2 signatures and auroral images (presented in\nthe previous two sections) are consistent with the scenario\nthat they were caused by a wedge-like current system. In\nSect. 7 we will discuss several sources of such a current\nsystem, including the substorm current wedge (SCW). The\nionospheric part of the SCW is called the auroral (substorm)\nAnn.

Together with the field-aligned currents, these\ncurrents cause the substorm-related H bay signatures. In\nSect. 3.1 the location of upward and downward FAC are es-\ntimated to be at 98\u25e6 and 120\u25e6 longitude, spectively, for\nthe 8 September 2002 event. Furthermore, one can infer\nthat KIL and OUL (L>4) were located beneath the auro-\nral electrojet showing the largest negative (southward) H de-\nflection (Fig. 2d). The negative H deflections at YOR and\nHAD (L<3) were much smaller. Since both stations were lo-\ncated south-west of the electrojet, the negative bay is mostly\ncaused by the FAC portion of the current wedge. HAN and\nKVI (3<L<4) show no pronounced H deflection because\nthey were located south of the upward FAC.\nDuring the course of a substorm, the location of the au-\nroral electrojet changes in latitude. This location change\ncan best be investigated with the IMAGE ground magne-\ntometer network which includes higher latitude stations than\nSAMNET. A calculation of the latitudinal distribution of\nthe westward component of the ionospheric equivalent cur-\nrents (Vanhama\u00a8ki et al., 2003), as determined from IMAGE\nground magnetic field data, is shown in Fig. 6a. The equiv-\nalent current shows an equatorward motion starting at about\n21:00 UT, indicating the growth phase of the substorm. Start-\ning at \u223c21:17:10 UT (second dashed line) the current shows\na pulse-like perturbation reaching higher latitude stations\n(just visible in blue). This perturbation corresponds to the\nfirst pulse of the ground Pi2s at high latitude (e.g., OUL in\nFig. 4). (For comparison Fig. 6 also marks the time \u2013 first\ndashed line from the left \u2013 of the first Pi2 pulse observed\nby Cluster in the tail lobe at 16RE , see Sect. 4). The time\nof the first current perturbation lies within the uncertainty\ntime interval (21:16:27\u201321:18:30 UT) of the first brightening\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/ Ann.

Afterwards there is some phase shift which\nmight be due to the interference of waves reflected from\nthe ionosphere. From the E-to-B ratio of the first and sec-\nond pulse, the propagation speed is estimated to be 600\u2013\n800 km\/s. This ratio compares well with the estimate of\nVx=627 km\/s and Vy= \u201372 km\/s, determined from a time-\ndelay analysis of magnetic field data from the four spacecraft\n(Sergeev et al., 2005), showing that the main propagation di-\nrection was Earthward. The important conclusion from these\ndata is that the pulses were launched tailward of Cluster and\ntraveled Earthward.\nIn Sergeev et al. (2005) it was argued that these pulses\nwhich we here identify as Pi2 pulsations show the signa-\ntures of nightside flux transfer events (NFTE). These struc-\ntures are thought to originate from the reconnection region\n(Sergeev et al., 1992). The following characteristics are typ-\nical for NFTEs (use dashed lines in Fig. 9 as visual aides):\na) asymmetric bipolar Bz, b) compression of Bx , c) plasma\nflow, Vz, towards the plasma sheet, (d) anti-correlation of Bx\nand Vz, and (e) direction change of Bz and Vz corresponds to\nthe maximum in Bx . The qualitative NFTE scenario given\nby Sergeev et al. (2005) is further supported by a quanti-\ntative analysis using analytical calculations by Semenov et\nal. (2005) who estimated that reconnection occurred at about\n30RE during the 8 September 2002 event. Figure 9 (bottom)\nillustrates the propagation of an NFTE and its encounter with\nCluster.\n5 Comparison of space and ground Pi2\nWe now compare ground and in-situ (Cluster) Pi2 observa-\ntions (Fig. 10). OUL and YOR were located in the nightside,\nand KAK was located in the dayside (Fig. 1a). OUL was\nchosen because it is among those stations showing the ear-\nliest Pi2 onset on the ground. Note that the inverse of H\nis shown for YOR to account for the polarization reversal at\n\u223c60\u25e6, placing OUL and YOR north and south of this reversal\nregion, respectively. The data from Cluster, YOR and KAK\nwere time-shifted so that signal peaks line up with those of\nOUL (dashed lines 2 through 5). It is noted that the first pulse\n(dashed line 1) recorded by Cluster and OUL is not seen at\nYOR and KAK. Allowing for these time shifts the Pi2 wave-\nforms are very similar during the main Pi2 event (lines 2\u20135).\nThe important conclusion is that space and ground Pi2s were\ncaused by the same process occurring in the magnetotail be-\nyond the location of Cluster (>16RE). This process also\ndictated the frequency of the space and ground Pi2. Using\nthe results from Sect. 4, we argue that pulsed reconnection\nwas this process.\nIn the following we estimate the travel time of the Pi2\ndisturbance from 16RE to the ionosphere. We assume for\nthis calculation that together with the observed NFTE pulses, Figure 9:  one column\nFig. 9. (a) Field and particle data from the four Cluster spacecraft\nfor the 8 September 2002 event (from Semenov et al., 2005), (b)\nCartoon illustrating NFTE propagation and its encounter with Clus-\nter (from Semenov et al., 2005).\nthe reconnection process created periodic high-speed plasma\nflows in the central plasma sheet (CPS). Although we de-\ntermined a velocity of 600\u2013800 km\/s for the NFTE, we use\nfor this calculation 1000 km\/s as an upper limit for the fast\nflows. These flows brake at the transition region between\ntail-like and dipole-like fields at, say 9RE , leading to a diver-\nsion of the cross-tail current into field-aligned currents (Birn\net al., 1999). These currents are established by shear Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves and travel to the ionosphere at about 1000 km\/s where\nthey create at times mid- to high-latitude Pi2 pulsations (e.g.,\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/ Ann.

(b) Comparison of currents associated with the Pi2 pulsations at Cluster and on the ground.\nBaumjohann and Glassmeier, 1984). Alternatively, the brak-\ning can launch compressional waves into the inner magne-\ntosphere which possibly generate low-latitude Pi2s (e.g., Al-\nlan et al., 1996; Lee and Kim, 1999; Kepko and Kivelson,\n1999). The propagation speed of the compressional waves in\nthe inner magnetosphere is of the order of about 500 km\/s.\nThe total travel times for these two scenarios are 98 s and\n149 s, respectively. (These calculations are similar to those in\nSlavin et al., 2002.) Both values appear to be too large to be\nreconcilable with the observed time delay of \u223c30 s between\nCluster\u2019s Pi2 and the ground Pi2 at OUL (see also Sect. 7.1).\nAn alternative propagation path for the Pi2 disturbance is\nthe tail lobe and\/or the separatrix layer (PSBL). In Sect. 3.2,\nit was shown that at the time of the ground Pi2 onset, OUL\nwas closest to the polar cap boundary, and therefore it might\nbe argued that a disturbance in the PSBL associated with\nthe tail lobe NFTE caused the high-latitude ground Pi2 ob-\nserved at OUL. In this case it would be required that the aver-\nage speed of lobe\/PSBL Alfve\u00b4n waves was about 3200 km\/s\nto travel 15RE in 30 s. Although it was found that the\nlocal Alfve\u00b4n speed (at 16RE) was between 600\u2013800 km\/s\n(Sect. 4), it is expected that the Alfve\u00b4n speed increases to\nabove 10 000 km\/s as the waves propagate towards the con-\nverging Earth magnetic field, and thus an average speed of\n3200 km\/s might be reasonable. In this scenario, the NFTE\ncould be the first signature of a current layer that maps from\nthe reconnection region along the PSBL into the ionosphere\n(see also Sect. 7.1). The reader is reminded that the first\nground Pi2 pulse was also recorded at HAN and NUR. These\ntwo stations were closest to OUL and south of OUL. Among\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3433\u20133449, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/\nA. Keiling et al.: Association of Pi2 pulsations and pulsed reconnection 3443\nthese three stations, OUL recorded the largest oscillations.\nThose stations located in the polar cap (north of OUL) did\nnot record large oscillations at onset time (Sect. 3.1).\nFurthermore, the Pi2 pulsations were superposed on\ncurrent signatures both in space (slope in By) and on\nthe ground (H component) (Fig. 10). The onsets of\nthe currents were delayed by the same amount as the\nspace Pi2 and the first ground Pi2 at OUL (dashed lines),\nconfirming that the currents are a feature of the Pi2 pul-\nsations. The strongest westward currents on the ground\nwere observed at high latitude which were closest to\nCluster\u2019s footprint. The downward current signature at\nCluster is likely the remote effect of a current in the\nPSBL. A strong downward current was recorded when\nCluster entered into the PSBL about 20 min after the\ntail lobe Pi2 event while the substorm was still ongoing\n(c.f. Fig. 2b: Cluster 1 entered the PSBL at about 21:45 UT).\nOwing to their separations (\u223c2000 km), the four space-\ncraft recorded this current within minutes of each other.\nUsing two spacecraft to determine the boundary velocity\n(\u223c21 km\/s), the thickness and density of the current layer\nwere estimated to range from 440 to 1800 km and 9 to\n28 nA\/m2 (1-D sheet approximation), respectively. These\nvariations could be due to temporal and\/or spatial effects,\nsince the spacecraft encountered the current layer within\nminutes of each other. Furthermore, temporal variations are\nto be expected if reconnection is time-varying as it was here.\nTo compare these current densities with the ionospheric\ncurrent calculated in Sect. 3.3, we multiply the current\ndensities by the thickness of the current layer and assume an\nazimuthal width of 1RE which yields total currents between\n6\u00d7105\u20139\u00d7105 A for the four spacecraft. These values are\nin fact larger than the ionospheric current during the Pi2\nevents, but we also note that they were recorded 20 min\nafter the main Pi2 event and we had to make an assumption\non the azimuthal width of the current layer. We also note\nthat the ionospheric currents further intensified after the Pi2\nevent (not shown). In Sect. 7 we will further discuss the\nsignificance of the PSBL current.\nA well known phenomenon for low-latitude Pi2s is that\nthey can occur simultaneously in both dayside and nightside\n(Sutcliffe and Yumoto, 1989). The event presented here also\nshows this feature: both YOR and KAK (located in the day-\nside flank, see Fig. 1a) show the same oscillations (Fig. 10).\nAlthough there appears to be no time delay between these\ntwo stations, we remind the reader that other mid- to low-\nlatitude stations showed time delays with respect to YOR and\nconsequently to KAK as well. It is also noted here that YOR\nand KAK continued to record similar oscillations (dashed\nlines 6, 7 and 8) after the main Pi2 event. Cluster and OUL,\non the other hand, showed similar oscillations (dashed lines\n9, 10 and 11) which deviated from those of YOR and KAK.\n6 Polar and Geotail observations\nAt the time of the Pi2 event recorded by Cluster and ground\nmagnetometer stations, two other spacecraft (Polar and Geo-\ntail) were located at about 9RE in the nightside magnetotail\n(Fig. 1c). Polar was \u223c1 h (MLT) east of Cluster, and Geotail\nwas in the Southern Hemisphere near midnight MLT. Both\nspacecraft were inside the PSBL near its outer edge. Fig-\nures 11a\u2013c show the three magnetic field components (band-\npass filtered: 4 s, 200 s) of each spacecraft including Clus-\nter for comparison. The shaded part indicates a region of\nenergized plasma. The vertical dashed line in each panel\nmarks the beginning of magnetic field perturbations which\nwere presumably associated with the Pi2 disturbance travel-\ning from a site at distances greater than 16RE toward Earth.\nHowever, neither of the two other spacecraft recorded mag-\nnetic field waveforms that were convincingly similar (visual\ninspection) to the Cluster Pi2s. Hence, (normalized) wavelet\npower spectra were generated of subintervals encompassing\nthe Pi2 event (Figs. 11d\u2013f). For each spacecraft the com-\nponent with the strongest signal in the Pi2 frequency band\nis shown. Figure 11d shows a strong signal in the Bz com-\nponent on Cluster 4 from about 21:20 to 21:25 UT in the\nperiod range 80\u2013100 s, which is of course the identified Pi2\nevent under investigation (Sect. 4). Before 21:20 UT it shows\nwave power with a larger period which corresponds to the\nfirst pulse observed by Cluster. Polar shows wave power at\n\u223c100 s in Bz (not shown), but By dominates between 21:18\u2013\n21:24 UT in the band from \u223c70 to 100 s and is thus shown\nin Fig. 11e. Geotail has its strongest Pi2 component in Bz at\n70\u2013100 s centered around 21:22 UT (Fig. 11f).\nAlthough Pi2 wave power was recorded by Polar and\nGeotail, there was no clear one-to-one correlation of the\nmagnetic waveforms as was the case between Cluster\u2019s\nPi2 and the ground Pi2. Furthermore, Polar and Geotail\nrecorded the onset of wave disturbances at \u223c21:17:40 UT\nand \u223c21:18:00 UT respectively, i.e., after Cluster observed\nthe onset which is to be expected since the Pi2s at Cluster\u2019s\nlocation traveled Earthward. However, the onset of the dis-\nturbances at Polar and Geotail occurred after the ground Pi2\nonset which is not expected if a simple 1-D propagation is\nassumed. These observations suggest that Polar and Geotail\ndid not record the first instance of the disturbance crossing\nthe y-z plane at X= \u20139RE , possibly due to the fact that the\nspacecraft were spatially separated in the y-z plane. For ex-\nample, Polar\u2019s footprint was located east of Cluster as well\nas east of the region of auroral brightening at the time of\nthe Pi2 onset. X-line reconnection in the magnetotail is as-\nsumed to be spatially confined in the east-west direction, and\nthus probably did not initially encompass field lines reaching\nPolar. Only as the substorm proceeded and the reconnec-\ntion site expanded eastward was Polar eventually magneti-\ncally connected to the reconnection site. Similarly, because\nGeotail was located in the opposite hemisphere, it can be ar-\ngued whether the first recorded disturbance by Geotail was\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/ Ann.

Clearly, these are speculations and we will not fur-\nther pursue them in this paper.\n7 Discussion\nHere we reported observations of substorm-related Pi2 pul-\nsations in the tail lobe in concert with ground Pi2.

The near-by PSBL (crossed 20 min after the\nPi2 observation in the tail lobe) carried current densities\nof 9\u201328 nA\/m2, which yields a total current of >105 A\n(see assumptions in Sect. 4)\nAnn.

Keiling et al.: Association of Pi2 pulsations and pulsed reconnection 3445\n\u2013 The total equivalent ionospheric westward current was\n<4\u00d7105 A during the Pi2 event.\n\u2013 The substorm evolution unfolded from the magnetotail\n(>16RE) to Earth.\nIn the following section, we will use these observations to\ndiscuss the source and the propagation path of this Pi2 event.\n7.1 Source of Pi2 pulsation on 8 September 2002\nThe Pi2 event recorded in the tail lobe is a series of 1 min-\nlong NFTE pulses following each other within 1-3 min.\nNFTEs are thought to form during the reconfiguration of\ntail magnetic field lines, i.e., reconnection (Sergeev et al.,\n1992). Semenov et al. (2005) showed that the magnetic\nfield perturbations in the tail lobe on 8 September 2002 are\nconsistent with analytical calculations of NFTEs propagat-\ning away from a reconnection site. The reconnection site\nwas estimated to be at \u223c30RE . Two alternative explana-\ntions for the field disturbances in the tail lobe might be put\nforward: a) flapping motion of the tail; b) Kelvin-Helmholtz\n(K-H) surface waves on the magnetopause. For the following\nreasons, however, these explanations are less likely. First,\nRunov et al. (2005) showed that flapping motion in most\ncases propagates azimuthally rather than Earthward as was\nthe case in our event. Second, the excitation of K-H waves\nare not causally associated with substorm onset, whereas it\nwas shown that the disturbances reported here were related\nto substorm onset as is expected for at least some NFTE.\nThe key observation is that the magnetic field oscilla-\ntions of the NFTEs were nearly identical to time-delayed\nground Pi2s, which justifies their classification as Pi2 pulses.\nThis similarity strongly suggests that both tail lobe Pi2s and\nground Pi2s were driven by the same source, namely pulsed\nreconnection. Thus, reconnection not only released the en-\nergy to drive ground Pi2s but also occurred at a rate that\nequaled the Pi2 frequency. Even if it turns out in future\nstudies that NFTE are the result of a process other than re-\nconnection, there must be, in any case, a process in the tail\nlaunching these disturbances, which has the periodicity and\nmagnetic field signature of Pi2s and which is the driver of\none class of ground Pi2s as shown here.\nFurthermore, the combination of ground signatures (mag-\nnetic field oscillations, auroral electrojet, and auroral\nbreakup; Sect. 3) suggest that the ground Pi2s were asso-\nciated with a transient current wedge system of down- and\nupward FAC. Such a current wedge has traditionally been\nassociated with the SCW, although, recently, it has also been\nshown that BBF create wedge-like ionospheric signatures\n(Kauristie et al., 2000). Furthermore, it was proposed that\na wedge-like current structure in the outer plasma sheet ac-\ncompanies NFTE structures (Sergeev et al., 1992). It follows\na discussion of each of these current sources and how they\nmight be associated with the event reported here.\nThe initiation of the SCW results from the braking of\nEarthward plasma flow in the near-Earth region (Shiokawa\net al., 1997). At the beginning, this braking creates field-\naligned currents which propagate as Alfve\u00b4n waves towards\nthe ionosphere. Under the right conditions, these waves re-\nflect off the ionosphere and continue to bounce inside the flux\ntube before a steady state FAC is established. This \u201cringing\u201d\nof the flux tube is believed to be the source of high-latitude\nPi2s and is called the transient response model of Pi2s (e.g.,\nBaumjohann and Glassmeier, 1984). Although the ground\nobservations on 8 September are consistent with this model,\nthe model excludes the possibility that the process determin-\ning the Pi2 frequency lies beyond 16RE as was the case for\nour event. Thus, this model can be ruled out as an expla-\nnation for the 8 September 2002 event. Nonetheless, it is\nstressed here that the ground Pi2s showed very large ampli-\ntudes which so far have only been associated with the tran-\nsient response model. We also rule out the scenario that a cur-\nrent disruption, located between Cluster and the ground, oc-\ncurred first which then triggered the SCW and possibly sent\nPi2 disturbances toward Cluster, because it was shown that\nthe Pi2 disturbance at Cluster traveled Earthward and was\nthe first signature in a sequence of substorm-related events\n(see also Sect. 7.2).\nIn a recent study (Kepko et al., 2001), it was proposed that\nsome ground Pi2s are caused by a periodic current diversion\ndue to periodic Earthward plasma flows. It was suggested\nthat the inertial current created during the braking of plasma\nflows would cause the ground Pi2s. It was further argued that\nthe associated amplitudes of the ground Pi2s would be a few\nnT and would remain relatively constant, and therefore these\n\u201cinertial current Pi2s\u201d could be distinguished from those Pi2s\ngenerated by the transient response mechanism which show\ndecaying amplitudes of tens of nT at high latitude. Kepko\net al.\u2019s scenario can be applied to our event (8 September\n2002), if we assume that the NFTE pulses, caused by pulsed\nreconnection, were accompanied by BBFs in the CPS. Al-\nthough the ground Pi2s on 8 September 2002 showed much\nlarger amplitudes than reported by Kepko et al., and in fact\nwere as large as what is expected for the transient response\nPi2, our calculations of the total ionospheric electrojet cur-\nrent were of the order of 1\u00d7105 to 4\u00d7105 A which compares\nwell with numerical and experimental estimates of the iner-\ntial current (e.g., 3\u00d7105 A by Birn et al., 1999; and \u223c105 A\nby Shiokawa et al., 1997). Thus, it might indeed be possible\nthat the periodic driving of a current disruption led to peri-\nodic inertial currents which subsequently caused the ground\nPi2s with large amplitude at high latitude. High-latitude,\nlarge-amplitude Pi2s have so far not been associated with the\nexternal periodic driving of the inertial current. In this sce-\nnario, however, it would be required that the Pi2 disturbances\ntraveled with an average speed of 3200 km\/s towards Earth to\ncover 15RE in 30 s (Sect. 5), which is rather unlikely. Sur-\nprisingly, Kepko and Kivelson (1999) also reported periodic\nfast plasma flows (BBF) at 17RE in the magnetotail (using\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 3433\u20133449, 2006\n3446 A. Keiling et al.: Association of Pi2 pulsations and pulsed reconnection\nISEE 2) that drove compressional Pi2 waves in the dayside\n(recorded by GOES 3, which was more than 20RE away\nfrom ISEE 2) and Pi2s on the ground (dayside flank) with\ntime delays of 32 s and 65 s, respectively. How the short time\ndelay of 32 s was achieved was not addressed in the study.\nThus, whether the tail lobe Pi2s are related to the BBF Pi2\nmodel (Kepko et al., 2001) is an outstanding problem.\nAnother possible source of an ionospheric current wedge\nmight be flow bursts in the magnetotail. Earlier studies\nhave pointed out the coupling of flow bursts to the iono-\nsphere via small wedge-like FAC structures (Kauristie et al.,\n2000; Nakamura et al., 2001; Amm and Kauristie, 2002).\nIn concert with these flow bursts conjugate auroral activity\nwas observed. One class of auroral activity associated with\nflow bursts are poleward boundary intensifications which\nare sometimes accompanied by Pi2 pulsations (Lyons et al.,\n1999; Kim et al., 2005). Another class is auroral streamers\n(Sergeev et al., 2000). However, these BBF-associated cur-\nrents have not been associated with creating the characteristic\nPi2 frequency in a one-to-one relationship as shown for our\nevent.\nAnother possible current source is the NFTE structure it-\nself. During the passage of NFTEs, Sergeev et al. (1992)\nshowed enhanced currents in the outer regions of the PS, us-\ning both ISEE 1\/2 spacecraft at \u223c20RE . It was suggested\nthat NFTEs also show a wedge-like current structure. These\ncurrents are directly associated with the reconnection site\n(Sydneva and Semenov, 1987). Location and timing anal-\nysis of currents at Cluster and on the ground are consistent\nwith the mapping of the ionospheric current along the PSBL,\npossibly into the reconnection site. The ground current sig-\nnature appeared after the current signature in the tail lobe\nwhich was associated with the tail lobe Pi2. It might there-\nfore be possible that the separatrix layer was magnetically\nconnected to the region surrounding OUL. We also remind\nthe reader that OUL was located at or in close vicinity to the\npolar cap boundary at ground onset, and was then engulfed\nby the poleward expanding bulge. This current layer is not\nassociated with the classical SCW which is generated much\ncloser to Earth, but possibly the Hall current which results\nfrom reconnection. In fact, previous studies have already ar-\ngued that the field-aligned Hall currents resulting from re-\nconnection as shown in simulations (Yamade et al., 2000)\nand observed in the diffusion region (Vaivads et al., 2004)\nmight play a significant role in the global current pattern (Ya-\nmade et al., 2000; Fujimoto et al., 2001). It was suggested\nthat these currents are carried by Alfve\u00b4n waves into the iono-\nsphere. Fujimoto et al. (2001) who estimated the PSBL cur-\nrent during a substorm obtained similar values as reported\nhere. Note that in this scenario, the current is not bouncing\nas in the transient response mechanism but oscillates at the\nPi2 frequency by direct control at the reconnection site by an\nas yet unknown mechanism.\nThe cavity mode is a global resonance with the same fre-\nquency throughout the cavity (e.g., Allan et al., 1996; Lee\nand Lysak, 1999). The Pi2 event on 8 September 2002 did\nindeed show oscillations with the same frequency over many\nL shells (L=1.2 to 6.1). However, cavity resonances are con-\nfined to mid- and low-latitudes (L<\u223c4) and do not show\nan amplitude maximum at high-latitude as was shown here.\nHigh-latitude Pi2s have been identified as Alfve\u00b4nic and their\nfrequency is independent of the cavity resonance (Yeoman\net al., 1991). Furthermore, we reported Pi2s in the tail lobe\nwhich is not part of the usual cavity (inner magnetosphere).\nA variation of the cavity mode, called the virtual resonance\n(Lee and Kim, 1999), does account for oscillations outside\nthe cavity. But for the 8 September 2002 event, the propa-\ngation direction of the Pi2 observed by Cluster was toward\nEarth and is thus also inconsistent with this model. It was,\nhowever, observed that after the main Pi2 event, low- to mid-\nlatitude stations continued to show similar oscillations which\nwere different from the high-latitude oscillations. Could this\nmean that a cavity mode established with a frequency close\nto the initial driving source of the main Pi2 event? This ques-\ntion cannot be answered here because measurements inside\nthe plasmasphere were not available.\nTwo additional observations, which have not been fully\nexplained in this study, are (1) that the first pulse of the Pi2\ntrain was only observed at some ground stations, and (2) a\nsystematic latitudinal time delay for a group of low- to mid-\nlatitude ground stations (located west of the current wedge\nsystem). Latitudinal and longitudinal variations of Pi2 pul-\nsations have been invested by several authors (e.g., Li et\nal., 1998; Uozumi et al., 2000, 2004), and various scenar-\nios are proposed for such variations. For example, Uozumi\net al. (2000, 2004) showed in statistical studies using ground\ndata from 210 MM that Pi2 pulsations are first observed in\nthe polar cap region albeit with smaller amplitude than those\ncloser to the simultaneously occurring aurora, followed by\nmid- and low-latitude stations. The Pi2 source of the high-\nlatitude (polar cap) Pi2s was not identified but it was spec-\nulated that equatorially excited fast mode waves propagate\noutward where they eventually resonantly excite lobe field\nlines, thus sending Alfve\u00b4n waves to the polar cap region. The\nlarger speed in the lobe region allows the Alfve\u00b4n waves to\narrive first on the ground. Uozumi et al. only considered\nground data, and thus could not identify a Pi2 disturbance in\nspace. Furthermore, it was not specified what determined the\noscillation frequency. Li et al. (1998) investigated longitudi-\nnal variations and concluded that they are best explained with\nthe presence of two wave sources, the SCW and the cavity-\nmode, both of which were ruled out in our event. Here we\nargued for an association of ground Pi2 and a driven current-\nwedge FAC system, but we also argued that fast mode waves\nmust have played a role in the inner magnetosphere because\nof propagation effects (i.e., identical waveforms but time-\ndelayed) among some stations and because of the simulta-\nneous occurrence of dayside Pi2.\nIn this discussion we did not include the observations of\nPolar and Geotail which we found to be inconclusive for\nAnn.

This could, however,\nsimply have been a spatial effect (spacecraft separation) be-\ncause disturbances (like BBF) in the extended magnetotail\nare known to travel at times in narrow channels (Angelopou-\nlos et al., 1992).\n7.2 Corollary\nIn addition to the fact that the tail lobe Pi2s were the first\n(at 21:16:40) observable substorm indicator, it is important\nto note that they propagated Earthward. This excludes the\nscenario that the source of the ground Pi2s was located be-\ntween Cluster and the ground stations. In fact, Sergeev et\nal. (2005) reported plasma signatures (including data from\nLANL geosynchronous satellites) for this event with regard\nto the transition from substorm growth to substorm expan-\nsion phase and concluded that the observations can be or-\nganized in the frame work of the modified NENL model\n(Baker et al., 1996) in which the events initially unfold from\nthe magnetotail toward Earth. Our analysis confirms this\nresult by including two additional observables. First, the\nfirst ground Pi2 pulse was recorded at \u223c21:17:10 UT at\nhigh- and midlatitude stations, i.e., 30 s after the Cluster Pi2\n(21:16:40 UT) which we associated with pulsed reconnection\nin the magnetotail. Second, it was pointed out that the onset\nof the strong electrojet intensification and its poleward ex-\npansion started at \u223c21:18:40 UT, which is also significantly\nlater than the Cluster Pi2 observation. It is interesting to note\nthat the ground Pi2 onset occurred before the strong electro-\njet intensification.\nFinally, it is noted that although the onset of wave distur-\nbances at Polar (\u223c21:17:40 UT) and Geotail (\u223c21:18:00 UT)\noccurred after the Pi2 onset at Cluster (\u223c21:16:40), as\nexpected, they also occurred after the ground Pi2 onset\n(\u223c21:17:10) which was unexpected. However, we remind\nthe reader of the caveats associated with these observations\n(Sect. 6) which could provide an explanation for this para-\ndox.\n8 Conclusions\nUntil recently the phenomenon of Pi2 pulsations had been\nconfined to the inner magnetosphere (<10RE) when it was\nfound that some ground Pi2 can be actively driven at the Pi2\nfrequency via plasma flows in the CPS (>10RE) (Kepko and\nKivelson, 1999; Kepko et al., 2001) which resulted in a new\nPi2 model. The mechanism for the flow periodicity, how-\never, was not specified in the BBF Pi2 model. Here we gave\nevidence in a case study (8 September 2002) that one type\nof Pi2s can directly be linked to the reconnection site. NFTE\npulses \u2013 remote signatures of pulsed reconnection \u2013 were ob-\nserved in the tail lobe at 16RE and were shown to have the\nfrequency and wave form (in the magnetic field) of typical\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3433\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 3433\u20133449, 2006\n3448 A. Keiling et al.: Association of Pi2 pulsations and pulsed reconnection\nPi2 pulsations. These observations relate for the first time\nthese two magnetospheric phenomena: NFTE and Pi2 pulsa-\ntions. So far, Pi2s in the tail lobes have not been incorporated\nin any previous Pi2 model.\nWith time delays, substorm-related ground Pi2 pulsations\nwere observed in both the dayside and the nightside spanning\nlow- to high latitudes. The ground Pi2s showed the same\nwaveforms as the tail lobe Pi2, which led to the conclusion\nthat pulsed reconnection was actively controlling the charac-\nteristic frequency of the ground Pi2s in addition to provid-\ning the energy. The nightside ground Pi2 pulsations could\nbe observationally organized by a wedge-like current sys-\ntem. However, it was not possible to unambiguously iden-\ntify the current source of the current wedge. Although the\nSCW is a candidate, the traditional transient response mech-\nanism, which relies on the internal ringing (Alfve\u00b4n bounce\ntime along magnetic field lines) of the SCW, was ruled out\nbecause the frequency source was not inherent to the inner\nmagnetosphere but to the reconnection site. Instead, a modi-\nfied scenario of the Kepko et al. (2001) model which uses the\nperiodic driving of the inertial current was proposed, which\nhas yet to overcome the time constraint of \u223c30 s for the Pi2\nsignal at 16RE in the tail to reach the ionosphere. In ad-\ndition, we alternatively considered the possibility that the\nionospheric current was directly linked to the reconnection\nsite, which is known to generate Hall currents of consider-\nable intensity. Time delays among mid- to lower latitude sta-\ntions and dayside Pi2s also suggested that fast mode waves\nplayed an additional role since they travel across magnetic\nfield lines.\nA great deal of uncertainty still remains about how Pi2\ndisturbances travel inside the inner magnetosphere. Our ob-\nservations are no different in this regard. Thus, our main\nresult here is the association of pulsed reconnection as the\nfrequency driver of Pi2 pulsation at various locations such as\nthe ground (both dayside and nightside over many L values)\nand the tail lobe at 16RE , thus adding to our understanding\nof what drives Pi2s. In Fig. 12 we show the various proposed\nfrequency drivers of Pi2 pulsations (not to be confused with\nenergy provider; see Sect. 1) supported by previous reports\nincluding the new observations.\nAs a corollary, we also showed that reconnection was the\nfirst event in a sequence of substorm events leading to ground\nPi2s, visible aurora, and auroral electrojet intensification,\ni.e., this substorm (8 September 2002) was consistent with\nthe modified NENL.\nAcknowledgements.
