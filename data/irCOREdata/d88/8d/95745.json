I propose to give an \nexample of precisely how we might attempt to generalise about a phenomena such as \nthe recurrence of the association between truth and sight without ignoring important \nanti-universalist points.  In doing this, I hope to give one example of how \nanthropology, in the original sense of the term, is a still possible enterprise, in spite of \nthe criticisms such an approach has had to face in the last thirty years. \n \nThe English word evidence is based on the Latin verb videre: to see. Familiar phrases, \nsuch as \u2018seeing is believing\u2019 or the assurance that something must be true because \u2018I \nsaw it with my own eyes,\u2019 are everywhere.  Such observations and many others all \nbear witness to a well-established European connection between seeing and truth \nwhich, as the Shorter Oxford Dictionary tells us, is so often associated with evidence.   \nSuch a link seems very ancient. Thus Thucidides says that, in contrast to that based on \nhearsay, the only true history is that based on the authority of sight (autopsia) \u2018of the \ntwo ways of knowing, through the eye and the ear, only the former gives us a true \npicture\u2019 because accounts based on memory distort and lie1.  St Paul, for his part, in a \nfamous Platonic mood, makes the same equation when he tells us of the dark glass, \nwhich, by interfering with our sight, keeps us from the full truth.  The idea that seeing \nis a guarantee of truth continues in less ancient times.  Thus, the greater truthfulness \n                                                 \n1 I am grateful to Gerard Lenclud for drawing my attention to this quotation. \nof what is seen  over what is reported through language is a major theme in the \nwritings of Augustine (Stock 1996), Bacon, Hume, Condillac (Roos 1999) and the \nempiricist\/sensationalist philosophers generally all make the point. This type of \nargument is found, with modifications, in Kant. In a completely different way writers \nsuch as Broca, after having noted the prominence of the lower brain in non-human \nprimates, especially the olfactory bulb, see evolution as the progress of the \ndevelopment of \u2018higher\u2019 senses, above all sight, over \u2018lower\u2019 senses, especially smell \n(Dias  2004).     \nBut, what do such recurrences of an association between truth and sight mean for the \nanthropologist? Are they more than a manifestation of a particular turn of our own \nculture, which, once again, we might naively take to be universal?  Such a classic \nform of professional scepticism does not, at first, seem to be born out by a cursory \ninspection of the ethnographic record. In an article, to which I return below, Tyler \n(1984) informs us that the association of truth and sight recurs in all Indo-European \nlanguages, including Hittite and also in many other language families. Ranging even \nmore widely the comparative linguist A. Viberg sees the association as extremely \ncommon in all languages (Viberg  2001). Certainly, a random trawl through \nethnographic sources comes up with many examples from all over the world. Thus A. \nStrathern (1975) and J. Robbins (2001) tell us that the New Guinea Islanders they \nstudied are obsessed with the unreliability of language and, while at the same time, \nstress the truth of knowledge obtained through sight.  Similarly A-C Taylor confirms \nthat the Amazonian Achuars are similar2.  M. Izard also tells me that much the same \nis true of the Mossi of Burkina Faso3.  According to Pinney (this volume) Indian \n                                                 \n2 Personal communication. \n3 Personal communication. \nNationalists, the British Colonial administration and the old lady in the film \nconvinced that photographs show Gods who are real are all influenced in their attitude \nto photography by the belief that what the lens sees is so. \n \nThere are some dissenting voices however, that give examples where sight is not \nlinked to the notion of truth.  A number of anthropologists claim to provide \nethnographic cases which purport to show that, among this or that group, another \nsense, usually hearing, is valued above vision  (Feld 1982, Gell 1995, Tyler 1994)4.   \nThe question of the relative significance of the different senses has also come up in \nthe scholarly tradition. Some, especially those eighteenth century philosophers who \nengaged with Molineux\u2019s problem (would a man, blind from birth, who had then been \ncured, recognise through sight, objects which he had only felt before his cure?), most \nnotably Diderot in  the Lettre sur les Aveugles, tangled endlessly with the question of \nthe relation and hierarchy of touch and sight.  \n \nThe presence of possible exceptions, based on a few exotic ethnographies, which are \nthen used as negative evidence against an assumed universality, is a familiar form of \nargument in anthropology. Such rhetoric was the cause of the popularity of work such \n                                                 \n4 I have to admit a certain scepticism as to how far the particular claims of Gell and Feld are based on a \ngeneral ranking of hearing over sight within these cultures and not simply on certain contextually \nspecific evaluations, for example hunting in dense forests or the typical New Guinea association of \nunseen birds with ancestors. In any case it is not clear how far these authors intend to push their \nargument.  Such hesitation on the other hand does not apply to the most categorical of the \nanthropologists.  Stephen Tyler, in an article already referred to, and which ironically supplies us with a \ngreat number of examples of the coupling of truth and sight, nevertheless concludes that : \u201cthe \nhegemony of the visual is not universal\u201d  and that empiricism as a folk theory is a peculiarity of certain \ngrammars.  The counter example he gives to set against the mass of the visualists, whom he dismisses, \nare the speakers of Dravidian languages.  His evidence is based on a form of primitive Whorfian \nexamination of Dravidian verbs for knowing, which are taken to offer an easy window to thought.  But, \neven if we accept his epistemology, there are serious reasons to doubt what he says about this particular \nexample.  Thus, in a personal communication, Nathaniel Roberts tells me that in Tamil, the most \nspoken Dravidian language, the word most used for \"to know\" is theriyum [root form: theri],  for which \nthe standard modern Tamil dictionary in the first place defines: 1) be visible; be seen 2) (of eyes) see; \nto perform the function of seeing. \nas that of Margaret Mead.  Indeed, it might seem that the only defence against such \nnegative argument is, either to challenge the reliability of the supposed exception, as \nwas famously done by Derek Freeman (1983), or to broaden and weaken the claim to \nuniversality.  Thus, we might modify the proposition that sight is always associated \nwith truth to one that merely claims an association between truth and knowledge \nthrough the senses in general.  However, even such a less specific claim would also be \nvulnerable in a different and more fundamental way, in much the way that all \ngeneralisations in kinship theory have been attacked (Needham 1971; Bloch and \nSperber 2002) by pointing out the obvious fact that the details of every ethnographic \ncase are different. Lumping these cases together would thus be a case of petitio petitii, \nan example of mere reductionism, where it seems that a universal category is created \nwhen in fact the cases only have in common what the definition created by the \nobserver has arbitrarily decided is significant. \n \nThese are familiar ways in which generalising claims in anthropology have been \nattacked and they are not without basis. Such destructive tactics have been effective to \nsuch an extent that many in the discipline have abandoned all attempts at grand theory \nand shudder at any claims that anything non-particularistic could exist in cultural \nphenomena.  However, the problem with such timid nihilism is that the prominence of \nrecurrences in the ethnographic record, such as the association of truth and sight, can \nonly be ignored through acts of blatant theoretical bad faith. But, given the soundness \nof the objections, we are left with the question of what are we to do about them.  \n \nIn this short paper I propose to give an example of precisely how we might attempt to \ngeneralise about a phenomena such as the non-universal but frequent recurrence of the \nassociation between truth and sight without ignoring the important anti-universalist \npoints referred to above. In doing this, I hope to give one example of how \nanthropology, in the original sense of the term, is still a possible enterprise, in spite of \nthe criticisms such an approach has had to face in the last thirty years . But, before \nengaging in grand theorising, I invite the reader to take a detour via an ethnographic \ncase. \n \nZafimaniry Theory \nDuring a recent period of research in the remote Zafimaniry village in Madagascar \nwhere I have been working for so long, I tried out a new research strategy, new for a \nsocial anthropologist at least, in order to understand what might be called \u2018Zafimaniry \nethno-psychology\u2019.  This consisted in demonstrating in front of my fellow villagers a \nwell-known psychological experiment concerned with the cognitive development of \nchildren.  This was in order to hear how the adults interpreted what they saw their \nchildren doing, as they observed the tasks they were asked to do. In other words, I put \nordinary people, who had never heard the word psychology and who, for the most \npart, could neither read nor write, in the position in which professional psychologists \nnormally place themselves. \n \nThe experiment referred to is called the \u2018false belief task\u2019.  It has been considered in \ncognitive psychology as being of great significance since it seems to reveal a critical \nmoment in the development of the child\u2019s cognitive development.  The false belief \ntask, in the version I used, consists in asking a child where a person who saw an \nobject placed under one hat, will look for it when they return after a spell outside the \nhouse, during which period the subject has seen the object being switched to another \nhiding place by the experimenter.  Adults and children over the age of six normally \nsay that the person will look for the object under the hat where the person saw it \nplaced before they left the house, but where they therefore know it is not anymore.  \nThis is taken to mean that they understand that the person who left the house holds a \nfalse belief. Young children, by contrast, say that the person returning will look for \nthe object at the place where it actually is.  In most of the psychological literature at \nleast, this is usually taken to mean that the young child has not yet understood that \nother people act in terms of what they believe the world to be; a notion that is \nobviously necessary for someone to realise that others could hold false beliefs about \nthe world.  Such a difference between the older children who rightly predict that the \nperson will look where they believe the object is and the younger ones who predict the \nperson will look for the object where it actually is, is striking and thought provoking. \nIt raises much broader questions, concerned not only with child development, but also \nabout what our understanding of others and their minds requires in order to act \ncompetently in the social world.  \n \nIt is precisely because this experiment raises such fundamental questions and because \nreflecting on its significance leads to such fundamental reflection about the human \nmind and the nature of human sociability, that it seemed interesting to see how the \nMalagasy villagers would rise to the challenge.  I thus used the Zafimaniry witnesses \nof the experiment and their surprise at the difference between the responses of the \nyounger and older children to trigger wide-ranging discussions on, among other \nthings, the nature of thought and language, child development and the cognitive \ndifferences between humans and other animals. These discussions took the form of \nanimated conversations in which all sorts of ideas were aired.  Certain of the musings \nof the villagers were expressed with a good deal of hesitation and others were much \ncontested. Some propositions, however, came loud and clear and were acknowledged \nas obviously right by everybody present. It is only these that I consider here. \n \nAmong these broadly agreed propositions was the idea that thought was, at bottom, a \nmatter of organising action so that it achieves desired ends.  In the villagers\u2019 view two \nthings follow from this pragmatic way of understanding mind.  First, non-human \nanimals are as capable of thought as humans; since pigs, for example, will think of \nturning up during the preparation of food in order to eat what peelings might be \navailable, and since fleas will think of hiding in the seams of clothing in order not to \nbe caught.  Secondly, and this follows inevitably from the previous point, the villagers \nwere quite clear that thought is independent of language, since they well know that \nanimals strategise their actions but do not talk5.   \n \nHowever, my informants did not undervalue language for all that. They were adamant \nthat language was a key factor in the superiority of humans over animals.  Their \naffirmation in this matter led me to ask them what was language for, if it was not, as \nthey asserted, necessary for thought.  The answer that was invariably given is that \nlanguage enables humans to lie. According to Zafimaniry theory, speech, and lying, \nwhich speech renders possible, is an extra technique, not available to animals but \navailable to humans, that enables adults to obtain by means of deceit what they have \ndesired in their thoughts. Furthermore, and in response to the experiment, the villagers \nalso argued that this refined technology for Machiavellian gratification, not possible \nfor animals, is also not available to very young humans, since infants obviously do not \n                                                 \n5 This work is on ongoing but for a somewhat fuller discussion of this material see Bloch 2006 \nknow how to speak.  Language is something that develops as human children mature \nand learn. Such reasoning was the basis of the villagers\u2019 interpretation of the false \nbelief task in terms of lying. It explains why young children, like animals, cannot lie \nbecause they do not yet have language, or, at least, sufficient control over language.    \nInfants fail the false belief task because they have not yet reached the developmental \nstage when they so control language that they are able to lie. This is an ability that \nrequires, in the first place, an understanding that others can hold false beliefs since \notherwise there would not be any point in lying6.  \n \nThe villagers also made clear that such ideas about language, motivation and thought \nhave important further implications.  The first concerns their description of the \nexperience of the social.  The second concerns the experiential side of evidence.  I \ntake these two in turn.  \n \nIn the discussions that followed the observation of the false belief task, the social was \ndescribed as a dangerous and exiting matter.  It involves living among chattering \nindividuals who, like you, are seeking to further their own ends by fair means or foul, \nand who therefore use all the tools available as speaking human adults. This makes \nnormal life risky because it involves being among people endowed with, and indeed \ncontinually using, their capacity for lying. At every step, therefore, there is a danger \nthat one acts in terms of a world that is false. This feeling is often expressed in the \nfear that those who falsely profess to love you might, really, be trying to poison you.  \n \n                                                 \n6 This point requires further elaboration not possible here. \nSecondly, since it is assumed that pragmatic deceit is the default form of social life, \nthis makes claiming truthfulness for what one is saying no trivial matter; therefore \ndoing so must be clearly distinguished from the everyday.  This leads to a continual \nemphasis in discourse which makes clear that normal interchange is not strongly \nclaiming that what one is proposing is true, so that, when one will actually want to \nclaim truthfulness for one\u2019s declaration, these will really stand out from normal \ndialogue.  This attitude has the effect that, for example, when one is asking for \ninformation, the most common answer is a semi indignant asa: \u2018search me\u2019, followed \nfor greater emphasis by tsy fantatro :  \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 and then\u2026 the information \nrequested is offered.  Similarly, this information when it is finally volunteered is \neither preceded or followed by the word angamba  meaning \u2018perhaps\u2019. \n \nAll this tentativeness can thus then contrast with those moments when one does want \nto be believed categorically. I may want to say \u2018There really is a mad dog in the \nvillage!\u2019  To do this one can either follow the assertion by the word: Marina, usually \nand appropriately translated as: \u2018It\u2019s true\u2019 or, for even greater claim to truth say \u2018Hita \nmaso!\u2019, lit. \u2018It was seen by my own eyes!\u2019 \n \nThe Zafimaniry, and all the Malagasy I know, are thus yet another example of the \nmany people around the world who associate statements claiming the authority of \nsensations, and especially sight, as being powerful evidence of truthfulness.  But their \ndiscussions following their observations of the false belief task takes us even further.  \nThey willingly explained why sight is so important: this is because it is verification \nwhich avoids the treacherousness of language used in social life, since social life is a \nmatter of dealing with speaking individuals who can hide the truth in order to further \ntheir own ends and trick you. The Zafimaniry thus, continually, implicitly and \nexplicitly, operate a strong contrast between information obtained through ordinary \nspeech, which they rhetorically mark as uncertain, and which they associate with \nlying, and information obtained through the sense of sight.  \n \nBut why do they use knowledge through the senses, and sight in particular7, to \ncontrast with the treachery of the social?  The answer is implicit in all their discussion \nof language.  What they seem to be saying is that: via language, truth is vitiated by \nMachiavellian social intentionality.  Sight, on the other hand, as it is thought about in \nZafimaniry theory\u2014if one can call ideas that are usually only implicit \u2018theory\u2019\u2014does \nnot involve the dangerous imagined intentionality projected by the source of \nknowledge.  What one sees has no intention to represent itself, falsely or otherwise; \none may mistake what one sees but that\u2019s your fault, not, as in the case of linguistic \ndialogue, the result of the intention of the schemers with whom one is in a \nrelationship. \n \nMachiavellian intelligence \nThe question, however, which the above suggests is the following.  Even if my \ninterpretation of what the Zafimaniry told me in response to their witnessing the false \nbelief task is accurate, why should that tell us anything about human beings in \ngeneral, the definitional aim of anthropological theory? Is the above simply one more \nlocal theory, to be added to the stamp collection of local representations which \nanthropology sometime seems to see as its only purpose?   \n \n                                                 \n7 It is probably because language is associated with hearing that sight is usually favoured over hearing, \nthe only other serious contender among the senses as the source of complex wide-ranging information. \nAs a first step in arguing against such a typically frequent pessimistic conclusion, we \nshould, first of all, remind ourselves of the problem of recurrence which such \ninsistence on the uniqueness of each case creates for a culturalist approach.  If we take \nthe particularistic stance this becomes incomprehensible.  Indeed, the similarity of \ndiscourses in the different ethnographic cases to which I refer is even greater than \nsuggested at first.  It is not only that we find, again and again, an association between \nsight and truth, we also find this associated with the distrust of what one might call \n\u2018hearsay evidence\u2019, for the reason that this may be vitiated by the treacherous \nintentionality which characterises ordinary social life.  In other words lying is linked, \nas it is so clearly for the Zafimaniry, to what the philosophers call theory of mind, the \ncontinual reading of intentionality which human communication uniquely implies and \nwhich ultimately makes deceit easily possible. Furthermore, this potential \ntreacherousness is most often seen as the product of the capacity for language that \nmakes lying possible.   \n \nThus, we cannot ignore the fact that so many people, in different cultures all around \nthe world, are saying similar things again and again. Such recurrences are a challenge \nthat anthropology should not dodge by finding occasional counter examples.  \n \nThen, there is another type of recurrence.  What ordinary people argue, according to \nethnographic reports, such as the one I briefly supplied above for the Zafimaniry, is \ninterestingly very close to a set of very differently styled propositions that are not the \nproduct of ethnographic interpretation but are typical of the theories of some \nevolutionary scientists reflecting on human sociability and language. \n \nEvolutionary theory has again and again stressed the problem caused by the potential \nwhich theory of mind, human intentionality and human language creates by making \ndeceit so easy.  There is no place here to discuss this massive literature which stresses \nthe point that the supremely well adapted tool for human sociability\u2014language\u2014\ncreates at the same time and by its very nature, a major problem for individual \nmembers of a community in that it places them at risk of being misled.  Scholars of \nmany different kinds see the awareness and significance of this fact as central. This \nfundamental point is found in the work of many anthropologists (Bateson 1951, \nRappaport 1971,Cosmides and Tooby 1992,  Knight 1998, Sperber 2001),  leading \nbiologists and theoreticians of evolution (Waddington 1960, Dawkins and Krebs \n1974;  Krebs and Dawkins 1984;  Maynard-Smith & Harper 1995), linguists (Lyons \n1977; Dessalles 2000) to name only a few.  The views expressed are varied, but like \nthe Zafimaniry all these writers are agreed that the complexity created by our ability \nto read other minds; that which makes language use possible (Sperber and Wilson  \n1995), exposes adult members of the species to a risk which only exists to a limited \nextent for other animals, if at all; that of being misled by conspecifics and thereby \nacting against one\u2019s own interest.  \n \nWe might conclude from this massive scholarly endorsement of Zafimaniry theory, \nthat, in this matter, there is little to be said other than that the villagers are right. But, \nif this is so, it raises a fascinating question. How can this agreement have come about \ngiven the totally different circumstances and contexts in which scholars and, in the \ncase of the Zafimaniry, unschooled shifting cultivators live? \n \nThe answer must be that there is something in the human condition that is accessible \nto the understanding of different members of the human species irrespective of \nhistory, living in however different circumstances around the globe, which produces \ncognate representations. In this case, it means that the experience and the awareness \nof the experience of social life and its dangers, of human intentionality and of the \nreading of human intentionality, is, in this most fundamental aspect, universal. To \nassume this implies that the representations people have are about this something: the \ndangers of living among communicative intentional beings, and that this same thing \nexists independently of the representations people have of it. And, indeed, it is \nextraordinarily difficult to imagine a human group unconcerned with deceit and lying. \nOf course, this does not mean that the representations of the dangers of language, \ndeceit and lying are determined by what they are about. It would be as wrong to forget \nthe specificities of each case as to forget the recurrences. Inevitably cultural, historical \nand personal circumstances will lead to variation in styles, directions and contents.  \nHow far purely intellectual speculation on this matter is pushed does also vary.  For \nexample, scientists are professionally trained to push their reflection, and some groups \nof people, amongst whom I would include the Zafimaniry, seem to have developed a \ngreater aesthetic orientation towards theoretical speculation than others. There is room \nfor much variation. It is possible that the kind of speculation I have been talking about \nis totally absent in some cases.  This, however, would not invalidate the argument I \nam developing, simply because these exceptions would not remove the existence of \nfrequent recurrences. But, in spite of variation all this theorising, when it occurs, is \nabout the universal awareness of the same thing. And, this awareness of this thing is \nsufficiently constraining to the images that can be produced to cope with it that \nfrequent similarities in representations will occur.  This is what explains the \nrecurrences. But, because the process of representation is also affected by other \nimportant factors: cultural, historical etc.,  we will only have family likenesses among \nthe representations of this same awareness. \n \nThe commonality of these representations has a further cultural implication that, this \ntime, has a practical side to it. The awareness of the potential treacherousness of the \nsocial and of the tool which language offers for deceit is recognised in all the \nethnographic cases cited not just as a subject of speculation but also as a major \npolitical problem and a threat to in-group sociability.  As a result, various practices \nand institutions are developed explicitly in order to cope with this threat, of which \nlegal devices, such as those discussed by Good in this volume, are the most obvious \nexample.  And, in parallel, the specificity of the threat of deceit that exists in language \nleads to the development and the valuing of devices and ideas for guaranteeing \ntruthful knowledge that is not caught in the web of human intentionality and speech.  \n \nThis is the explanation for the recurrence that this essay seeks to explain: the \nassociation of truth and the senses and more particularly sight.  With the type of \npsychology the awareness of deceit creates, the idea that what is seen is more truthful \nthan what is reported in speech seems an obvious way to go in order to by-pass human \nintentionality and deceit.  Again we have a weak form of determinism.  The total \ncausal path is the following. The reality of the human social and the potential of \nhuman language leads necessarily to an awareness of the dangers of deceit and lying. \nThis universal awareness strongly influences the representations we find of the social, \nlanguage and deceit, hence the recurrences. These types of representations regularly \npredispose, but not necessarily always, to the association linking truth and sight.  It is \nthus not surprising that this particular path is so often chosen, though, of course, there \nmight well be cases where it is refused. \n \nAnd we can go even further in the line of weak determinism that has guided me \nthroughout this essay.  Another case of recurrence, which the ethnographic record \nthrows up, can be seen to have the same root.  This is the similarity the techniques of \ndivination found in so many places around the world display.  These very commonly \ninvolve techniques for producing truthful propositions that, unlike other forms of \ntelling, do not involve language and its inevitable corollary, human intentionality.  \nThe famous techniques of Azande divination are of this type, as are such practices as \ntea leaf reading, astrology and many others.  The point about all these is that they use \ndevices which produce truthful answers that are the fruit of a form of causation, such \nas physiological configuration, in the case of the reading of entrails, or physics, in the \ncase of throwing stones in the air, that avoid social causation. (This, of course, creates \nthe well known problem that the answers must then be interpreted and translated by \nhumans who re-introduce intentionality and hence fallibility.)  Such divination \ntechniques seem to tell the truth through what can be seen in states of affairs not \nbrought about by the intentionality of human minds and thus implicitly recognise the \ndangers of the social and of human language with its potential for lies.   \n \nThis seems to be, in part, what Holbraad (this volume) seems to be arguing for Cuban \ndivination that, like Azande divination, is also taken by its practitioners as truth telling \nby definition.  According to Holbraad divination is ontologically creative, a process \nthat seems somewhat mysterious if ontology is taken to mean an exhaustive account \nof the world as it is. If that is so, it is difficult to understand how it could be added to.  \nHowever, the sheer demonstration of an effect that seems purely the product of the \nna\u00efve laws of physics that, as we know (Spelke, Phillips and Woodward 1995), we \ninnately recognise as necessarily true, seems a more convincing explanation of the \nfeeling of ontological certainty than Holbraad is describing. The revelation of \ndivination would thus seem to be, for the practitioners, a peep at the world as it \nappears to the senses, in contrast to the treacherous representations peddled by others. \n \nInterestingly the truth telling powers of divination seem to have similar basis as the \nna\u00efve attitudes to photography discussed by Pinney where, at first, all sorts of people \nwere convinced that cameras told the truth because they were machines; in other \nwords, because human intentionality was not involved in their powers of \nrepresentation. \n \nHere again the line of causation, from the shadowy awareness of the nature of the \nsocial and of the implications of the human mind to actual practices seems a tempting \nand, therefore, frequently followed path.  But, for all that, it is not a necessary path, \nnor is it a rigidly mapped out one.  Thus, if divination techniques are commonly \nsimilar, they are also each and every one different, and there may well be societies \nwhere such techniques are totally absent.  This variation and occasional absence, \nhowever, would not contradict the kind of argument I have been developing here.  As \nso many anthropologists rightly, if somewhat trivially, insist, the social world we live \nin is the product of dialogue, of discourse, of culture, etc. But this does not mean that \nthese dialogues, discourses and cultures are not about something which people, \nthankfully to a certain extent apprehend and this something as the psychologist \nGibson stressed, itself suggests non-random affordances that are, again and again, \nrepresented.   \n \nBut there is more to this question than simply the constraints that come from what the \nrepresentations concern.  The ability to read each other\u2019s minds and the dangers this \ncreates is a fundamental matter for the adaptation of Homo sapiens. This ability \nnecessarily evokes the ideas about the dangers about deceit that concern my Malagasy \ninformants and evolutionary psychologists.  However, unlike theory of mind itself, \nwhich can operate below the level of consciousness, and usually does, knowledge \nabout deceit and lying needs to be, and evidently is, available to consciousness, if \nonly so that it can be guarded against.  This is clearly of crucial importance for all \nwho live in a human type society and therefore it is quite likely that, as the \nevolutionary psychologists argue, we are probably innately predisposed to detect \ncheaters.  But even if this is so, such ability, however, cannot be just automatic since \nit requires consequent conscious protective actions which, I would argue, are likely to \nbe organised in dedicated institutions.  These include, among others, the ones \nmentioned above: certain divination techniques and legal systems. \n \nThis long and tentative line of causation is the story that can explain the familiar mix \nof recurrences and variations that I have been concerned with throughout this essay.  \nThe universal consciousness of the presence of lying and deceit in society logically \nimplies the possibility that people can hold false beliefs.  This awareness can be, and \noften is, used as a handle for creating, in varying degrees of elaboration, a \nrepresentation of the mechanisms of the nature of mind, a representation that is \nconstrained both by what mind is like and by our social need to be on guard against \nlying.  Peeping at the mind by using the handle of mistaken knowledge is what the \ninventors of the false belief task intended to do and it is also what the Zafimaniry and \nthe people from the other ethnographic cases evoked seem to be doing when, for \nexample, observing the experiment, and also in many other moments of their lives, \nthey try to explain the difference between the younger and the older children.  \nKnowledge of lying and deceit is thus only a handle, however it is only a handle \nhence the relative variation, but it is a good handle that we may be predisposed to use, \nhence the recurrences and the profundity of the reflection. \n \nAnd this sort of weak determination works the other way too. The consciousness of \nthe problem of deceit, so often carrying with it an associated and over-determined \ntheory of mind, leads to recurrences in institutional means to enforce the truth and \nalso to imaginative speculation about what might establish truth.  These speculations, \nin turn, lead to recurrent rhetorical formulations such as: \u2018It\u2019s true, I saw it with my \nown eyes!\u2019 or in Malagasy, considerably more elegantly,  \u2018Hita maso!\u2019.  \n \nAcknowledgments \nAlthough this is a short article it has often involved me in reaching out beyond my \nusual competence.
