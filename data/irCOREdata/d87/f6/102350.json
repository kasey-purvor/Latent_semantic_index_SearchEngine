Liu, Student Member, IEEE, R. Hoshyar, Member, IEEE, X. Yang, and R. Tafazolli, Member, IEEE\nAbstract\u2014Recently, the notion that a logical next step towards\nfuture mobile radio networks is to introduce multihop relaying\ninto cellular networks, has gained wide acceptance. Nevertheless,\ndue to the inherent drawbacks of multihop relaying, e.g., the\nrequirement for extra radio resources for relaying hops, and the\nsensitivity to the quality of relaying routes, multihop cellular net-\nworks (MCNs) require a well-designed radio resource allocation\nstrategy in order to secure performance gains. In this paper, the\noptimal radio resource allocation problem in MCNs, with the ob-\njective of throughput maximization, is formulated mathematically\nand proven to be NP-hard. Considering the prohibitive complexity\nof finding the optimal solution for such an NP-hard problem, we\npropose an efficient heuristic algorithm, named integrated radio\nresource allocation (IRRA), to find suboptimal solutions. The\nIRRA is featured as a low-complexity algorithm that involves not\nonly base station (BS) resource scheduling, but also routing and\nrelay station (RS) load balancing. Specifically, a load-based scheme\nis developed for routing. A mode-aware BS resource-scheduling\nscheme is proposed for handling links in different transmission\nmodes, i.e., direct or multihop. Moreover, a priority-based RS\nload balancing approach is presented for the prevention of the\noverloading of RSs. Within the framework of the IRRA, the above\nthree functions operate periodically with coordinated interactions.\nTo prove the effectiveness of the proposed IRRA algorithm, a case\nstudy was carried out based on enhanced uplink UMTS terrestrial\nradio access\/frequency-division duplex with fixed RSs. The IRRA\nis evaluated through system level simulations, and compared with\ntwo other cases: 1) nonrelaying and 2) relaying with a benchmark\napproach. The results show that the proposed algorithm can\nensure significant gains in terms of cell throughput.\nIndex Terms\u2014Cellular networks, fixed relay stations (RSs),\nmultihop, radio resource allocation (RRA).\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMULTIHOP RELAYING has traditionally been studiedin the context of ad hoc wireless networks mainly as a\nmeans of enabling the network operation without any infrastruc-\nture. In recent years, an upsurge of interest has been observed\nin the application of multihop relaying in cellular networks in\norder to create multihop cellular networks (MCNs) [1].\nThe propagation attenuation of a radio signal is proportional\nto the link distance raised to the power of a loss exponent.

Therefore, by breaking a long-distance\npath into several segments, much lower path loss at each path\nsegment can be achieved. Moreover, heavily shadowed users\ncan employ multihop relaying to bypass obstacles, thereby\ngaining improved radio channel conditions. Due to the above,\nmultihop relaying provides an opportunity for performance\nimprovements in cellular systems. Nevertheless, multihop\nrelaying has inherent drawbacks, e.g., the requirement for\nextra radio resources for relaying hops, and the sensitivity to\nthe quality of relaying routes. Therefore, well-designed radio\nresource allocation (RRA) algorithms are crucial in MCNs,\nin order to effectively exploit the benefits of relaying, while\nminimizing its disadvantages.\nFor RRA in MCNs, aside from the scheduling of the conven-\ntional radio resources (this is termed as radio resource sched-\nuling in this paper), transmission route selection should also\nbe considered. In the literature, these two issues have generally\nbeen addressed separately.\nIn the mobile ad hoc network (MANET) research com-\nmunity, many routing algorithms have been proposed [17].\nSome examples are optimized link state routing (OLSR), ad\nhoc on-demand distance vector (AODV), and dynamic source\nrouting (DSR). In essence, these algorithms are designed with\nnetwork infrastructureless in mind, and their main objective\nis to establish\/maintain network connectivity, rather than to\nmaximize system capacity. As a result, these algorithms are\nnot suitable for MCNs. In recent years, routing in the context\nof MCNs has become a research issue, and a few algorithms\nhave been proposed so far, e.g., location-based routing [4],\npath-loss-based routing [7], transmission-power-based routing\n[8], and congestion-based routing [3]. These algorithms can,\nto some extent, solve the route selection problem in MCNs.\nHowever, the selected routes are not necessarily optimal in\nterms of the system resource utilization efficiency.\nIn conventional cellular networks, the radio resource sched-\nuling algorithms have been investigated thoroughly. Currently,\nthe widely used algorithms in practical packet-based cellular\nnetworks are usually based on user prioritization combined with\ngreedy resource loading [12]. However, these algorithms are all\ndesigned based on the assumption that every user in the system\nis directly connected to the BS, whereas this assumption is no\nlonger valid in MCNs. Some work on resource scheduling in\nmultihop systems has been published recently. In [2], a frac-\ntional bandwidth and power allocation algorithm is proposed\nfor orthogonal regenerative frequency-division multihop com-\nmunication systems, and in [9] a centralized downlink sched-\nuling scheme is proposed for cellular networks utilizing small\n0733-8716\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

An example of connectivity of network nodes in the system scenario.\nnumber of relays. However, these algorithms generally do not\ntake the capacity limits of RSs into account, and therefore during\nthe resource scheduling, no consideration is given to the preven-\ntion of RS overloading.\nThe coordination between routing and resource scheduling in\nMCNs is also crucial and warrants careful investigation, espe-\ncially since strong interdependency between the two functions\nis envisioned in MCNs. The strategy for effective coordination\nof routing and packet scheduling in packet-based MCNs, how-\never, has not yet been fully investigated.\nIn this paper, transmission routes are treated as one extra\ndimension of the resource space of conventional cellular net-\nworks. The route selection and conventional radio resource\nscheduling are then integrated into one problem in the context\nof MCNs. The throughput maximization RRA problem is\nmathematically formulated and proven to be NP-hard. Consid-\nering the prohibitive complexity of searching for the optimal\nsolution to such an NP-hard problem, we propose instead an\nefficient heuristic algorithm, named integrated radio resource\nallocation (IRRA) algorithm to find suboptimal solutions. To\nprove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a case study\nwas carried out based on enhanced uplink UMTS terrestrial\nradio access\/frequency division duplex (UTRA\/FDD) with\nfixed relay stations (RSs). As shown by the simulation results,\nthe proposed algorithm can ensure significant throughput\ngains compared with the nonrelaying case and to a benchmark\nrelaying approach.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system sce-\nnario is described in Section II. In Section III, the throughput\nmaximization RRA problem is formulated and proven to be\nNP-hard. In Section IV, a discussion on the design of an efficient\nalgorithm for the NP-hard problem is presented. Next, based on\nthe conclusions, the IRRA algorithm is proposed. A case study\nof the IRRA follows in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes\nthis paper.\nII. SYSTEM SCENARIO\nA multicell cellular radio scenario is considered. In each cell,\na number of fixed RSs are deployed. A user terminal can either\nconnect to the BS directly, or via an RS. Between RSs and the\nBS, good channel conditions (e.g., line-of-sight) are assumed,\nand hence direct transmissions are envisioned. An RS is as-\nsumed to be able to act as a relay for multiple users and has\nlarge enough buffer to hold the data being relayed. An example\nTABLE I\nPOSSIBLE FREQUENCY-DIVISION RELAYING CASES\nof connectivity of network nodes in our system scenario is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 1.\nIn order to avoid the self-interference of RSs, the transmis-\nsion and reception of an RS should not take place on the same\nfrequency at the same time. Consequently, two basic relaying\nstrategies are envisioned for multihop systems: frequency-di-\nvision relaying and time-division relaying [2]. Under these\nschemes, the transmission and reception of an RS are either\nseparated in the frequency-domain, e.g., by using different\ncarrier or subcarrier frequencies, or in the time-domain, e.g., by\nemploying different time slots or medium access control (MAC)\nframes. The study in this work is based on frequency-division\nrelaying.\nIn order to reduce system complexity, in our work, it is as-\nsumed that each type of link has a fixed frequency band assigned\nto it. Therefore, three possible frequency-division relaying cases\nare envisioned, as shown in Table I.\nIn case A, BS-MS and RS-MS links share the same frequency\nband, and thus a user terminal does not need to switch frequency\nbands during a change of transmission\/reception mode (from di-\nrect to multihop or vice versa). From the perspective of terminal\ncomplexity and mode switching latency, this is an advantage\ncompared with cases B and C, especially when the respective\nfrequency bands used in BS-MS and RS-MS links are spectrally\ndistant.\nIn cases A and C, one frequency band is dedicated solely to\nBS-RS links. This configuration can effectively exploit the ca-\npacity of these links, which normally have high resource uti-\nlization efficiency due to very good radio channel conditions, as\nwell as high traffic volume due to the fact that one RS can serve\nmultiple users.\nIn this work, case A is assumed. Nevertheless, cases B and C\nwill be studied and evaluated in our future work.\nIt is worth noting that the algorithm in this work is derived\nfrom frequency-division relaying case A. However, it can also\nbe applied to the similar scenario of time-division relaying, in\nwhich BS-RS links have dedicated time resources but BS-MS\nand RS-MS links share the same time resources.\nIII. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND PROOF OF NP-HARDNESS\nIn this section, we formulate the throughput maximization\nradio resource allocation (TM-RRA) problem and prove it to\nbe NP-hard.\nWe assume that the area of interest consists of cells, each\nof which is overlaid by RSs and serves users, where\nand .\nWe define a radio resource unit in the underlying cellular net-\nwork (e.g., the combination of a data rate and a time slot) as\na conventional resource unit (CRU), and the combination of a\nCRU and a transmission route as a general resource unit (GRU).\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

System resource pool and user CGRU sets.\nA GRU is essentially one allocation choice for a user, and it can\nbe characterized by multiple attributes, which might vary de-\npending on the nature of the cellular system considered. For ex-\nample, in a TDMA-based MCN, one GRU may be characterized\nby three attributes: a time slot, a data rate, and a route. By con-\ntrast, in an FDMA-based MCN, a GRU might be characterized\nby a frequency, a data rate, and a route.\nGRUs in the system can be easily determined based on a\npreexisting knowledge of the system\u2019s conventional resource\nand the network topology. An example of the system resource\npool is shown in Fig. 2, where the GRUs are indexed by\n, and so on. Different shapes or fill patterns of GRUs\nrepresent different attributes. For example, we let the round,\nhexangular, and square shapes correspond to rates of 32, 64,\nand 128 kb\/s, respectively, whereas \u201cbackward diagonal line,\u201d\n\u201cforward diagonal line,\u201d \u201cvertical line,\u201d and \u201chorizontal line\u201d\nfill patterns represent routes 1\u20134, respectively. Then, GRUs\n, and so on.\nIn our work, we assume that a user can only be allocated one\nGRU, i.e., one combination of a CRU and a route, at any alloca-\ntion instant in time. In the case where multiple CRUs or multiple\nroutes can be used for a user simultaneously, to keep the above\nassumption valid, we regard each combination of the multiple\nCRUs or routes as one extended CRU or route. GRUs containing\nnormal or extended CRUs\/routes will all be considered so that\nthe RRA algorithm still only produces at most one GRU per user\nat any one allocation instant in time.\nDuring resource allocation, not all the GRUs in the system\nresource pool would be valid candidates for each user. Some of\nthem may not be required by a user, for instance if the data rate\nof the GRU is too high for a user given its queue size. We define\nthese kinds of GRUs as unneeded GRUs (UNGRUs). In other\ncases, GRUs may not be usable by a user, for instance if the\ndata rate is too high for the user to reach given its power limit.\nWe define these kinds of GRUs as unusable GRUs (UUGRUs).\nWe regard all other resource units, which are not UNGRUs or\nUUGRUs, as candidate GRUs (CGRUs), which are to be sched-\nuled by the RRA algorithm.\nLet denote the CGRU set (CGRUS) of user , which in-\ncludes all the CGRUs of that user. It can be easily precalculated\nbased on the knowledge of the system resource pool, as well as\non the system status and the user\u2019s profile (e.g., queue size and\nFig. 3. User CGRU sets and relevant CGRU groups.\npower headroom). As shown by the example in Fig. 2, GRUs\nare valid candidates for user 1, and there-\nfore .\nEach of the elements represents a resource allocation choice for\nuser 1.\nIt is worth noting that one CGRU essentially contains two\npieces of information: the GRU and the associated user. For ex-\nample, CGRU . CGRUs in different\nCGRUSs have different associated users, hence should be re-\ngarded as different items. Consequently, if .\nWe let denote the union of all the CGRUSs from\nto , as shown in Fig. 3. We define the action selecting\nan element (CGRU) from set as having the meaning of\nallocating the corresponding GRU to the associated user. Each\nsuch action achieves a certain amount of throughput, while\nconsuming some of the system\u2019s capacity. We let denote a\nBoolean variable indicating whether element is selected (1\nfor \u201cYes\u201d and 0 for \u201cNo\u201d), and , and denote\nthe achieved throughput, the consumed capacity of the BS\nand the consumed capacity of the RS , respectively, if element\nis selected.\nWe note that in , some elements might share exclusive\nattributes. For example, in a time-division multiple-access\n(TDMA) system, a time slot is normally treated as an exclusive\nresource, i.e., if assigned to a user, it should not be used by\nothers. In order to take this issue into account, we assume that\nset includes totally relevant CGRU groups (RCGRUGs)\n, each of which shares a certain attribute (e.g., a\ndata rate or a route). As shown by the example in Fig. 3, all\nthe items in share the attribute of hexangular shape (i.e.,\n64 kb\/s), whereas all the items in share the attribute of\nhaving \u201cvertical line\u201d fill pattern (i.e., route 3). An element of\ncan be a member of multiple groups, such as , which is\nin both and . To introduce the aforementioned resource\nexclusivity, we assume that for , at most\nelements can be selected for assigning to their associated users.\nThe value of is known depending on the attribute that the\ngroup is sharing. For instance, it is infinite for a group sharing a\ncertain data rate, i.e., a data rate can be given to infinite number\nof users simultaneously. By contrast, in a TDMA system, it is\n1 for the group sharing a particular time slot.\nAssuming the above, the TM-RRA problem can be described\nas follows: given a particular system snapshot (system capacity,\nuser profiles, etc.), select elements from the set so as to\nachieve maximum system throughput, while adhering to the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In this case, the constraints (3) and (5) are removed, and\n(2) is changed to the following form with the subscript being\ndropped:\n(7)\nFor CGRU in set , the achievable throughput is known\nand the BS capacity consumption can be easily precalcu-\nlated in this case based on the interference status of the GRU,\nand on the channel gains and QoS requirements, etc. Moreover,\ncell capacity is normally a pre-known hardware limitation\n(e.g., maximum transmission power) or a value preset by the net-\nwork operator (e.g., maximum load or rise over thermal (RoT)\n[11]). Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, all CGRUSs ( to\n) can be precalculated, and hence, it is clear that the only\nunknown in this special case is .\nNow, we recall a well-known NP-hard problem, the multiple\nchoice knapsack problem (MCKP) [15], as follows: Given a\nknapsack, an item set including items, and a partition of\nthe item set , with of item\nof item , and of the knapsack, select\nitems from set so as to maximize the aggregate profit from all\nthe selected items, while adhering to the following constraints:\n1) the aggregate weights of the selected items should be less\nthan the (weight bearing) capacity of the knapsack and 2) for\neach item subset ( to ), only one item is selected.\nNote that any arbitrary instance of the MCKP can be viewed\nas an instance of the aforementioned special case of the\nTM-RRA problem, by applying the following mappings: the\nitem set is mapped to the set (including the mappings from\nand of the items in set to and of the elements in\nset , respectively), the item subsets are mapped to\nthe CGRUSs , respectively, and finally, the knapsack\ncapacity is mapped to the BS capacity . The item\nselection for that MCKP instance is in one-to-one correspon-\ndence with the CGRU selection for the mapped instance of the\nspecial case of the TM-RRA problem. Thus, the MCKP can\nbe regarded as a restricted version of the TM-RRA problem.\nSince the MCKP has already been proven to be NP-hard [15],\nwe conclude that the TM-RRA problem is NP-hard.\nIV. KEY ISSUES OF THE RRA DESIGN IN MCNS AND A\nHEURISTIC ALGORITHM\nDue to the NP-hardness of the TM-RRA problem, the time\nrequired to find its optimal solution increases exponentially with\nthe size of the problem. This prohibitive processing complexity\nis intolerable in practical systems.\nIn this section, to aid with the design of a practical RRA al-\ngorithm for MCNs, we discuss routing, radio resource sched-\nuling, and their interactions. Based on the conclusions, an effi-\ncient heuristic algorithm, named IRRA, is derived.\nA. Routing\nFrom the architectural perspective, two basic routing strate-\ngies are envisioned in relay-based systems: centralized and\ndistributed. Under the centralized strategy, routing is performed\nin a central controller, which normally possesses powerful\nprocessing capabilities so that sophisticated routing algorithms\nmay be adopted to optimize the system performance. However,\nthis strategy requires extensive information gathering from\nthe distributed network nodes to the central controller, which\ninevitably results in signaling overheads and processing delay.\nWith the distributed strategy, all network nodes from the source\nto the destination jointly perform route determination. This\nstrategy can function when no central controller is reachable,\nbut its performance is normally limited by network nodes\u2019\nprocessing capabilities and knowledge of the network status.\nIn our system scenario, a BS could serve as a central con-\ntroller in a cell, and, since maximally two hops are considered\nin our study, the signaling overhead as well as the signaling\ndelay would be acceptable. Therefore the centralized strategy is\nchosen in our work in order to optimize the system performance.\nAs for the algorithm of routing, take a close look at the\nTM-RRA problem in (1)\u2013(6), we can easily conclude that the\noptimal route of a user is the one that has highest achievable\nthroughput with unit amount of induced system load. In our\nwork, such a load-based routing algorithm is proposed, and its\nrouting cost function is as follows:\n(8)\nwhere is the load cost indicator (LCI) of the route\nfrom user to its connected receiver\/transmitter CXX (a BS\nor an RS), and and represent the con-\nsumed system capacity of the route and the data rate on the route,\nrespectively.\nThis cost function reflects the consumed system capacity\nwhen delivering unit amount of traffic on a particular route.\nGiven a certain system capacity constraint, if every user em-\nploys the route with the least LCI from among the possible\nroutes, the system throughput can be maximized.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 15,2010 at 08:55:20 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nLIU et al.: INTEGRATED RADIO RESOURCE ALLOCATION FOR MCNS WITH FIXED RELAY STATIONS 2141\nIt is worth noting that in the route-selection process for a\nuser, in order to guarantee a fair comparison, it is important to\ncalculate the LCIs of all of its routes based on the same data\nrate. However, the choice of this data rate normally does not af-\nfect the routing result as long as it is the same for all routes.\nThis is shown in the case study in Section V, where after fur-\nther derivation of (8), the data rate is removed completely from\nthe cost function. However, if the result of routing does de-\npend on the choice of the data rate in (8), the routing process\nshould be performed based on the current data rate, or on the\none that is assigned by the network and thus will be employed\nin the forthcoming transmission time intervals (TTIs). If these\nrates are zero, the minimum nonzero rate can be taken as an\napproximation.\nB. Radio Resource Scheduling\nAs for the radio resource scheduling in MCNs, two basic\nstrategies are envisioned: centralized and hierarchical. With the\ncentralized strategy, the radio resource scheduling is mainly\nperformed by the BS. By contrast, in the case of the hierar-\nchical strategy, a layered algorithm architecture is foreseen:\nat the higher layer, the BS splits the radio resource space into\nfragments for individual RSs and itself, respectively. At the\nlower layer, the actual radio resource scheduling is performed\nby RSs (for multihop users) and the BS (for direct transmission\nusers) according to their given resource spaces.\nIn general, the centralized strategy is simpler than the hierar-\nchical one. The latter, on the other hand, is able to perform faster\nradio resource scheduling in order to quickly adapt to system\ndynamics. For the sake of simplicity, and easier coordination\nwith the centralized routing, the centralized (BS-based) radio\nresource scheduling strategy is employed in our work. Never-\ntheless, the hierarchical strategy is an interesting topic for our\nfuture study.\nIn our system scenario, the resource scheduling for BS-RS\nlinks can still use the conventional algorithm due to the fact that\nthese links are always in direct transmission mode and have ded-\nicated frequency band. This issue will not be discussed further\nin this paper.\nThe scheduling for BS-MS and RS-MS links, on the other\nhand, is more complicated due to the sharing of the frequency\nspectrum. In this case, when allocating resources to users, not\nonly the capacity constraint of the BS, but also those of RSs\nshould be respected. Towards that end, we propose the following\nstrategy: first, perform BS resource scheduling based on the ca-\npacity constraint of the BS, and then carry out RS load bal-\nancing to fine-tune the resource assignments in order to prevent\nthe overloading of RSs. There are two issues requiring attention\nunder this strategy.\nFirst, BS resource scheduler should be aware of users\u2019 trans-\nmission\/reception modes, and treat users in different modes dif-\nferently. The main reason is that multihop users are not directly\nconnected with BSs, hence the estimation of their consumed\nBS capacities is different from the conventional case for direct\ntransmission users.\nSecond, the RS load balancing function should have a user\nprioritization mechanism in order to decide whose resource as-\nsignments should be tuned when an RS is overloaded. For in-\nstance, the following priority function can be used:\n(9)\nwhere is the priority of user , and RS is the tentative\nRS (overloaded) of user . Apparently, the higher the , the\ngreater benefits this user can potentially bring to the system by\nusing its tentative relaying route (instead of the direct transmis-\nsion route). Therefore, if we use this priority function and start\nthe overloading relief process from the user with the lowest pri-\nority, the benefit of multihop relaying can be preserved as much\nas possible.\nC. Interactions Between Routing and Radio Resource\nScheduling\nIn MCNs, multihop transmissions normally consume less\nsystem capacity if routing is appropriately performed, and the\nradio resource scheduler should promptly capture the saved\nresources and assign them to others who suffer a deficit. Con-\nsequently, radio resource scheduling should be based on the\nresults of routing. On the other hand, radio resource scheduling\naffects the system interference\/loading pattern, which in turn\nmight affect the decisions of user route selection.\nTo perform RRA in the context of the above strongly interde-\npendent scenario, the best mechanism is to perform global cross-\noptimization with lots of iterations. But as proven in Section III,\nthe problem is NP-hard. Thus, the optimization algorithms are\nhardly to be feasible in practical systems.\nA more practical solution would be to perform routing and\nresource scheduling within one algorithm framework, where re-\nsource scheduling always takes place immediately after routing.\nThis allows the saved resources from multihop relaying to be\ncaptured promptly. Moreover, RS load balancing is considered\nwithin resource scheduling so that overloading of the RSs can\nbe effectively avoided. This algorithm can be run periodically\nto quickly adapt resource assignments as required by the system\ndynamics.\nD. Integrated Radio Resource Allocation (IRRA)\nBased on the above discussions, we propose an IRRA algo-\nrithm, and it comprises three entities. The first entity, named,\nLoad-Based Route Manager (LBRM), is responsible for the se-\nlection of user routes based on (8). The second, named, Base\nStation Resource Scheduler (BSRS) is for the scheduling of\nuser resource assignments based on the available BS capacity.\nUsers in different modes should be treated differently during this\nscheduling process. Finally, the third entity, named, Relay Sta-\ntion Load Balancer (RSLB), is responsible for the fine-tuning\nof user assigned resources\/routes, based on a priority function,\ne.g., the one shown in (9), in order to avoid the overloading of\nRSs.\nThe IRRA is executed periodically as illustrated in Fig. 4, and\nthe basic procedure in each execution is as follows.\n1) The LBRM is run first, and outputs user routes.\n2) Based on the user routes from the LBRM, the BSRS is\nexecuted and outputs user resource assignments (e.g., data\nrates) based on the available BS capacity.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The overall operating procedure of the IRRA.\n3) Finally, the RS load balancing is carried out based on the\nuser routes and resource assignments from the LBRM and\nthe BSRS, respectively. The outputs of the RSLB are fine-\ntuned user resource allocations (including user routes).\nThe IRRA is generally a low complexity algorithm. Never-\ntheless, it is worth mentioning that at one execution instant,\nthe above basic procedure can also be run iteratively, i.e., after\nstep 3), return to step 1) to do the routing again based on the\nupdated system status, then step 2), and so on, until the output\nconverges or a predefined maximum number of iterations is\nreached. However, if the iterative procedure is used, the com-\nputational complexity of the algorithm increases.\nV. A CASE STUDY IN ENHANCED UPLINK UTRA-FDD\nWITH FIXED RSS\nTo prove the effectiveness of the IRRA algorithm, in this sec-\ntion, we apply it to enhanced uplink UTRA-FDD [11] with fixed\nRSs. The entities of the IRRA are described in greater detail, the\nalgorithm complexity is estimated, and finally, the system per-\nformance is evaluated through system level simulations.\nA. System Scenario\nIn this case study, to apply the frequency-division relaying\nexplained in Section II, we introduce an extra carrier frequency\nfor RS-BS links, whereas MS-RS links share the original carrier\nfrequency with MS-BS links.\nThe resource scheduling in enhanced uplink UTRA-FDD is\nessentially transport format combination (TFC) selection [11].\nNote that each TFC corresponds to a certain transmission data\nrate, and hence transmission rates are the major type of resource\nin enhanced uplink UTRA-FDD.\nIt is worth mentioning that the allocation of spreading codes\nis not considered in enhanced uplink UTRA-FDD, due to the\nfact that each user has a uniquely assigned scrambling sequence,\nthus the spreading code resources in use by a user do not affect\nthose available for others.\nB. Application of the IRRA\n1) Load-Based Route Manager (LBRM): In the LBRM, the\nroute selection of each user is based on the LCIs of all of its pos-\nsible routes. For MCNs with different underlying cellular sys-\ntems, the LCI formula (8) can be derived into different concrete\nforms, depending on the interpretation of the system capacity.\nIn the context of this case study, (8) can be derived further as\nfollows.\nSince the capacity of enhanced uplink UTRA-FDD is inter-\nference-limited, we define the consumed system capacity of a\nroute as the total induced system interference by the transmitter\n(10)\nwhere is the transmission power of user\nand represent the received\npower of user at BS and at RS , respectively,\nand , respectively, represent the end-to-end\ntransmission losses between user and BS , and between\nuser and RS , and finally, is a user-specific factor\nlargely determined by the user\u2019s location.\nSimilar as the load factor in [14, Sec. 8.2.2.1], the load of user\nat any receiver of interest, , is defined as follows in\nthis case study:\n(11)\nwhere is the received power of user at the re-\nceiver of interest, and represents the total interference at\nthe receiver. In order to guarantee the quality of signal reception,\nthe signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the user at its connected\/\ntargeted receiver should be maintained around a certain target\nvalue, which normally is a pre-known value depending on the\nuser data rate and the quality-of-service (QoS) (e.g., block error\nrate) requirement. Therefore, the load of user at its connected\nreceiver, , can be calculated as follows [12], [14]:\n(12)\nwhere and represent the actual\nreceived SIR and the SIR target of user at its connected re-\nceiver, respectively.\nThen, can be obtained from the following equation:\n(13)\nwhere can be calculated with (12), and\nand can normally be estimated based on system\nmeasurements.\nConsidering (8), (10), (12), and (13) all together, we obtain\n(14)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The operating procedure of the LBRM.\nSince during the route determination, the comparison of LCIs\nis always performed between all the possible routes of a partic-\nular user, and can be consid-\nered to be fixed values. Therefore, (14) can be redefined, without\naffecting the routing results, as follows:\n(15)\nBased on (15), the LBRM can easily determine and select the\nroute with the highest load efficiency for each user. However,\nin order to avoid \u201cping-pong\u201d effects causing unnecessary sig-\nnaling overheads and oscillations, an LCI hysteresis (e.g., 2 dB)\nshould be applied when updating user routes. The operating pro-\ncedure of the LBRM is illustrated in Fig. 5.\nIt is worth noting that in the LBRM, the route selections for\nindividual users are performed independently. Consequently, a\nnumber of users may happen to choose the same RS, which\nthen becomes overloaded. Therefore, the routes selected in the\nLBRM might require fine-tuning by the subsequent RSLB. The\nreason for such a design, instead of performing the fine-tuning\nin the LBRM itself, is that the RSLB has full knowledge of\nall users\u2019 routes and resource assignments as calculated by the\nLBRM and the BSRS, respectively, and therefore, it is able to\nmake better decisions.\n2) Base Station Resource Scheduler (BSRS): The operating\nprocedure of the BSRS is shown in Fig. 6. Note that the rate\nallocated to a user could be zero, which would indicate that the\nuser is not allowed to transmit in the next IRRA period. Load es-\ntimation needs to be performed for both the current and the new\nrates, in order to see how much extra load will be incurred at\nthe BS. Unlike conventional scheduling algorithms in enhanced\nuplink UTRA-FDD [12], the BSRS employs different load es-\ntimation approaches for users in different transmission modes.\nFig. 6. The operating procedure of the BSRS.\nFor a user in direct transmission mode, the load of the user\nat the BS can be easily calculated with (12). On the other hand,\nfor a user in multihop mode, since its connected receiver is a\nRS, not the BS, (12) can only be employed to calculate its load\nat the connected RS. Nevertheless, based on (11) and (13), it is\nnot hard to see that the load of user at its interfered receiver,\n, can be derived from the load at its connected receiver\nwith the following equation:\n(16)\nTherefore, the load at the BS of a user in multihop mode\nshould be calculated based on (12) and (16) together.\n3) Relay Station Load Balancer (RSLB): As illustrated in\nFig. 7, the operating procedure of the RSLB is: first, estimate\nthe loads of RSs with (12) and (16) based on the tentative user\ntransmission routes and rates from the LBRM and the BSRS,\nrespectively, then check whether any RSs would be overloaded,\nand if so, commence the overloading-relief process for those\noverloaded RSs in order of descending load.\nDuring the overloading-relief process of a particular RS, as\nmentioned in Section IV-B, a user prioritization mechanism is\nrequired in order to decide from which user the process starts,\nand with what sequence it proceeds. The priority function em-\nployed in this case study is provided in (9).\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 15,2010 at 08:55:20 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

The operating procedure of the RSLB.\nAs for the overloading-relief approaches, two basic options\nare envisioned: switching the chosen user from the overloaded\nRS to an underloaded one, or reducing its data rate. The first\nscheme is generally applicable in scenarios where the RS ca-\npacity is limited by transmission power or by time slots, etc., in-\nstead of by interference. In these cases, if we switch a user from\nan overloaded RS to an underloaded one, the load caused by that\nuser is then completely shifted from the old RS to the new one.\nHowever, if the capacity of the RS is limited by interference, the\nfirst scheme is not effective, since the load (i.e., interference in\nthis case) cannot be completely shifted between RSs, and if the\nunderloaded RS is too far away, the user might generate even\nmore load on the old RS after being switched to the new one. In\nthis case study, the second approach is employed.\nC. Algorithm Complexity\nWe consider the cell of interest to be cell , which includes\none BS, RSs, and users. We assume that each user has\ncandidate rates , and that a user\ncan only be relayed by RSs in the same cell, and thus the total\nnumber of possible routes for a user is .\nAs for the RBLM, the LCI calculation for a particular user\nrequires multiplications based on (15), the searching\nfor its best route requires comparisons, and the subsequent\nuser route updating with respect to the given hysteresis at most\nrequires two operations. Hence, at most, opera-\ntions are required in one execution of the LBRM.\nIt is not hard to see that the worst case of the BSRS is when\nall users are in multihop mode and are demanding higher rates.\nIn this case, the BSRS involves two steps only. The first one is to\nprioritize all the users, and this requires at most\noperations [18]. The second step is to allocate rates to indi-\nvidual users. We assume that user \u2019s current rate is rate number\n. Then, at most, rates\nneed to be tested for this user. In each of these tests, six op-\nerations are required to calculate the new load based on (12)\nand (16), and two operations are required to calculate the extra\nload and compare it with the available BS capacity. Hence, to-\ngether with the six operations required by the estimation of a\nuser\u2019s current load, at most, operations are re-\nquired in the second step. Therefore, the BSRS involves at most\noperations in each execution.\nThe worst case of the RSLB is when all users are connected\nto a single (overloaded) RS so that the complexity for priori-\ntizing the connected users is maximized. In this case, the RSLB\ninvolves three steps. The first step is to estimate the load of\nthe RS, and this requires load estimations of users based\non (12), and then a summation of load values. These re-\nquire totally 3 operations. The second step is to prior-\nitize the connected users of the RS, and this requires at most\noperations [18]. The finial step is the over-\nloading-relief for the RS. We assume that user is assigned rate\nnumber by the BSRS. Then, at most,\nrates need to be tested for this user in the re-\nlief process. Each test involves two operations for calculating\nthe load of the new rate based on (12), and two operations for\nchecking whether or not the resulting load reduction is sufficient\nfor relieving the overloading. Hence, at most,\noperations are required in the finial step. Therefore, the RSLB\ninvolves at most\noperations.\nNote that in the worst case of the BSRS, rate number is\nfinally assigned to user ( to ). Therefore, the used\nin the RSLB should the same as the employed in the BSRS.\nConsequently, the total number of operations in the three entities\nis at most . It is\nnot hard to see that the global worst case occurs when\n( to ). Therefore, the worst-case algorithm complexity\ncan be approximated as .\nIt is clear that this quadratic complexity is far lower than the\ncomplexities of optimal algorithms which grow exponentially\nwith the size of the problem.\nD. Simulation Results\nBy system level simulation, the IRRA is evaluated and com-\npared with the nonrelaying case, as well as with a benchmark re-\nlaying approach that adopts pathloss-based routing [7] for user\nroute determination and a conventional scheduling algorithm\n[12] for rate scheduling. The simulation parameters and settings\nare listed in Table II.\nFig. 8 demonstrates the obtained throughput with different\nsession arrival rates. We observe that when the offered traffic\nload (reflected by the session arrival rate) is light, without the\nhelp of relaying, traffic can still be delivered satisfactorily. How-\never, when the offered traffic load becomes heavy, systems with\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 15,2010 at 08:55:20 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Average cell throughput versus session arrival rate.\nrelaying perform significantly better than that without. More-\nover, in the case of relaying with the IRRA, the ratio of relayed\ncell throughput to total cell throughput can be up to 75%, as in-\ndicated in Fig. 9.\nThe IRRA can achieve much higher cell throughput than the\nbenchmark relaying approach. This is mainly due to the fol-\nlowing reasons: first, the routing criterion used in the IRRA, i.e.,\nLCI, can well reflect the most beneficial route for a certain user\nin terms of uplink resource\/load efficiency. Second, the bench-\nmark relaying approach has no mechanism to effectively avoid\nFig. 9. Ratio of relayed cell throughput to total cell throughput versus session\narrival rate.\nFig. 10. Average relayed cell throughput versus session arrival rate.\nthe overloading of RSs. As a result, RSs are very likely to be\noverloaded when offered traffic load becomes heavy. For ex-\nample, as indicated by Fig. 9, in the case of relaying with the\nbenchmark algorithm, ratios of relayed cell throughput to total\ncell throughput decrease dramatically when the session arrival\nrate increases. Third, in the IRRA, the radio resource scheduling\nis well coordinated with routing, and therefore the benefits of re-\nlaying can be promptly captured and translated into throughput\nimprovements. Finally, the IRRA is run periodically, hence the\nuser transmission rates and routes are able to effectively adapt\nto system dynamics, e.g., traffic bursts.\nIt can also be observed that the gain of the proposed IRRA al-\ngorithm varies with the RS-to-BS distance , and the maximum\ncell throughput gain is about 215% in comparison to the nonre-\nlaying case, obtained when equals 65% of the cell radius. This\nis because currently, we assume users can only be relayed by the\nRSs in the same cell. Consequently, when becomes bigger, the\nnumber of eligible users for relaying will decrease. This is indi-\ncated in Fig. 10, where the average relayed cell throughput de-\ncreases as increases. This reveals that the actual performance\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on April 15,2010 at 08:55:20 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Therefore,\nthe deployment of RSs should try to match user distributions in\norder to increase the number of users around RSs, thereby po-\ntentially increasing the number of users using relaying.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe studied the RRA problem in MCNs. The optimization\nproblem with the objective of system throughput maximization\nwas mathematically formulated and proven to be NP-hard. Con-\nsidering the prohibitive processing complexity of finding the op-\ntimal solution for such an NP-hard problem, we proposed an\nefficient heuristic algorithm, named IRRA, to provide subop-\ntimal RRA in practical systems. To prove the effectiveness of the\nIRRA algorithm, a case study was carried out based on enhanced\nuplink UTRA-FDD with fixed RSs. As shown by the simulation\nresults of the case study, the IRRA can ensure significant gains\nin terms of cell throughput compared with the nonrelaying case\nand to a benchmark relaying approach.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank L.
