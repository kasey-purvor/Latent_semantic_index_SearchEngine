Introduction\n[2] System-scale data on surface grain size variability in\ngravel bed rivers are crucial for understanding and explain-\ning sediment transfer processes [Parker, 1991; Hoey and\nFerguson, 1994; Seal and Paola, 1995; Seal et al., 1997;\nRice and Church, 1996, 1998; Rice, 1999]. They are also\nlinked to ecological processes including macroinvertebrates\n[Rice et al., 2001a, 2001b] and the habitat preferences of\nfish such as salmonids [Rimmer et al., 1983; Cunjak, 1988;\nHeggenes, 1996]. While it has been possible to quantify and\nto explain local gravel grain size variability for considerable\ntime [Bluck, 1982; Milne, 1982] many of the pressing\nsedimentological [Rice and Church, 1996, 1998] and eco-\nlogical [Dunham and Rieman, 1999; Torgersen et al., 1999;\nThompson and Lee, 2000] research questions are now\nemerging at the system scale, over many tens of kilometers\nrather than a few river reaches. The result is a need to scale\nupward [Cunjak, 1996; Lewis et al., 1996; Folt et al., 1998]\nwithout sacrificing the local spatial detail that is a crucial\npart of the sedimentological and ecological processes that\nin turn create larger scales of emergence. This requires\nanalysis of the surface grain size of rivers as a continu-\nously varying [Fausch et al., 2002] patchy environment.\n[3] The only technique that can feasibly deliver at scales\nranging from the patch (meter scale) through to the drainage\nbasin (kilometer scale) is remote sensing. Recent techno-\nlogical advances are changing the ways in which remote\nsensing can be applied to fluvial geomorphology as tasks\nwhich traditionally required labor intensive field work are\nnow coming within the reach of remote sensing methods.\nDevelopments in digital image processing methods have\nalready allowed for bathymetric measurements using air-\nborne remote sensing [e.g., Lyon et al., 1992; Winterbottom\nand Gilvear, 1997; Roberts and Anderson, 1999; Westaway\net al., 2003] and flow type classifications in relation to\nriverine habitat [Marcus, 2002; Whited et al., 2002; Marcus\net al., 2003]. However, one of the remaining difficulties in\nthe application of remote sensing to fluvial environments is\nthat particle sizes, a fundamental descriptor of riverine\nhabitats, cannot be easily measured with remote sensing\nmethods.\n[4] There is a significant body of literature describing\nhow close range terrestrial remote sensing and image\nprocessing can be used to determine particle sizes automat-\nically, both in a general civil engineering context [Raschke\nand Hryciw, 1997; Ghalib and Hryciw, 1999; Shin and\nHryciw, 2004; Wettimuny and Penumadu, 2004] and a\nspecific fluvial geomorphology context [Adams, 1979;\nIbbeken and Schleyer, 1986; Butler et al., 2001]. In such\ncases, the pixel resolution of the image is very small when\ncompared to particle sizes. For example, Raschke and\nHryciw [1997] used imagery where particle size as seen in\nthe imagery, in pixel units, ranged from 50 to 2000 pixels.\nThis implies that individual particle boundaries can be\ndetected and therefore that individual particles can be\nmeasured. Unfortunately, these methods are not applicable\nto airborne and satellite imagery since the resulting ground\nresolution is too coarse to allow individual particles to be\ndelineated. As an example, we shall considerer recent\nairborne sensors, such as the XEOS imaging system of\n1Now at Department of Geography, University of Durham, Durham, UK.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0043-1397\/05\/2005WR003994$09.00\nW11426\nWATER RESOURCES RESEARCH, VOL. 41, W11426, doi:10.1029\/2005WR003994, 2005\n1 of 9\nGe\u00b4nivar, Inc., or the ADS40 system of Leica, Inc., capable\nof maximum ground resolutions in the range of 3\u20135 cm. In\nfluvial terms, this would make sand and fine gravel sub\npixel size and boulders, the largest clasts commonly of\ninterest, up to 50 pixels in size. These equivalents are not\nsufficient to achieve individual particle delineation. Closer\nrange studies could be used to generate high-resolution data,\nbut this would be at the expense of having to become\nground based, so undermining the need to generate system-\nscale data. However, Carbonneau et al. [2004] showed that\nautomated grain size measurements of exposed reaches of a\ngravel bed river were possible from high-resolution airborne\nimagery. With rigorous testing, Carbonneau et al. [2004]\ndemonstrated that local 2D semivariance maps derived from\nthe imagery could be correlated to the median grain size\nin the image locality if all the relevant parameters are\ncalibrated. These 2D semivariograms are calculated from a\nwindowed application of local 2D semivariograms calcu-\nlated from the image digital numbers (i.e., pixel brightness\nvalues) in the windowed area. Numerical testing by\nCarbonneau et al. [2004] established that the optimal\nwindow size for semivariance mapping is 33 \u0001 33 pixel\nwhich, in the case of the 3 cm resolution imagery describes\nin this work, corresponds to a spatial area of 1 m2. Each\nimage is converted into a semivariance map by extracting the\nsill plane value for each local semivariogram and repeating\nthis process until the entire image has been mapped. Each\npoint in the semivariance map therefore gives a local semi-\nvariance value for a 1 m2 area in the original image. An\nempirical relationship is then established between median\ngrain sizes observed in the field and semivariance maps. For\nthe image data set described by Carbonneau et al. [2004],\nthe following calibration relationship was obtained:\nD50 \u00bc 0:34SV\u00fe 10:12; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere D50 is the median diameter of surface particles, in\nmm, in the 1 m2 area and SV is the dimensionless local\nsemivariance sill value in the corresponding 1 m2 area of the\nimage. While equation (1) gives the median grain size for a\ngiven 1 m2 image patch as a function of local semivariance,\ninitial results showed that local semivariance also correlates\nwith other grain size fractions such as D16 and D84, albeit\nwith different regression relationships. Correlations with the\n84th percentile were stronger. However, since the 50th\npercentile is a much more widely used parameter in\ngeomorphology and fisheries habitat management, it was\nchosen as the principal objective.\n[5] The empirical relationship (1) allows for an auto-\nmated estimation of the grain sizes of the dry areas of the\nchannel. Figure 1 shows a sample image with its associated\ngrain size map. Closer examination of Figure 1b shows the\nsensitivity of the model. The sandy patch in the upper right\ncorner of the image in Figure 1a is clearly detected as well\nas the coarser nature of the smaller bank on the left-hand\nside. Variations in grain size within the larger right bank\nare also well detected. The overall quality of these grain\nsize estimates was validated with independent check data\ncollected from sites scattered along a 10 km river reach and\nthus completely removed from the calibration data site.\nThis allowed the precision of grain size estimates to be\nestablished as \u00b111 mm [Carbonneau et al., 2004].\n[6] Remotely generated, high-resolution and high-\nprecision grain size estimates could be used to obtain grain\nsize measurements over whole river basins and so allow\ninvestigation of large-scale grain size variations while\nsimultaneously retaining the necessary local detail. How-\never, the automated grain size measurement method pre-\nsented by Carbonneau et al. [2004] is limited to dry\nexposed areas. Generally, such areas represent a small\npercentage of the total active river channel. For example,\nTable 1 shows the total surface areas for different channel\nsubarea types measured on the whole length of the main\nchannel of the Sainte-Marguerite River, Quebec, Canada.\nThe channel has been divided into three classes: dry\nexposed bed; optically shallow wetted area, defined here\nas areas where the wetted bed is visible in the air photos;\nand deep wetted areas, defined here as areas where the\nFigure 1.

Since the dry area\nrepresents only 19% of the total channel area, dry area\ngrain size mapping would provide an incomplete survey of\ngrain sizes along this river and its usefulness for sedimen-\ntary link identification and other applications will be\nlimited.\n[7] The main goal of this paper is to develop the method\ndescribed by Carbonneau et al. [2004] in order to allow for\nthe automated estimation of median grain size in the wetted\nperimeter. Visual observations of the image data set used\nby Carbonneau et al. [2004] show that the river bed can be\nclearly seen in the shallow submerged areas which suggests\nthat the method of Carbonneau et al. [2004] might be\napplied in this subarea, which represents 67% of the active\nchannel area (Table 1). The secondary goal of this paper is\nto assess the usefulness of automated grain size mapping to\nthe characterization of the long profile of grain size\nvariations in the downstream direction and to determine\nif this method is capable of identifying the kinds of\nsedimentary link units now recognized to be a crucial\ncomponent of both the sedimentology and the ecology of\ngravel bed rivers [e.g., Rice and Church, 1998; Rice et al.,\n2001a].\n2. Methods\n2.1. Airborne Digital Imagery Acquisition\n[8] The work discussed in this paper uses a set of high-\nresolution airborne imagery of the Sainte-Marguerite River\nin Quebec, Canada. The Sainte-Marguerite River is a gravel\nbedded salmon river flowing in a valley carved by quater-\nnary era glaciers. Bed material is composed of well mixed\nigneous and metamorphic rocks [Dube\u00b4, 1994]. The litho-\nlogical composition of this mixture is stable along the\nchannel length and thus no spatially dependent clast color\nvariations can be observed. Suspended sediment load along\nthe channel is not altered by tributaries and therefore the\nsuspended sediment load can be assumed as constant for the\nwhole channel. Channel width in the Sainte-Marguerite\nRiver varies from a few meters at the headwaters to\napproximately 80 m at the mouth. Most of this river is\neasily accessible for fieldwork purposes thanks to a paved\nroad that follows the valley floor.\n[9] This study covered the full 80 km of the main branch.\nIn August 2002, a helicopter survey was carried out during\nthe summer period of low flow. The airborne surveys were\nconducted at an altitude of 155 m between 10 am and 3 pm.\nWeather conditions were generally cloudy and dry with\nsunny spells. The XEOSTM imaging system, developed by\nGe\u00b4nivar, Inc., was fitted to a helicopter in order to obtain\nplan view digital imagery of the entire study area. For the\nselected flying height of 155 m, this resulted in images with\na ground resolution of 3 cm (1:350 scale). Image format was\n3008 pixels \u0001 1960 pixels in the standard visible bands of\nred, green and blue. Images were collected at 60% overlap\nto allow for photogrammetric work to be carried out in the\nfuture. Two days were required to complete the surveys\nyielding 4184 images. Figure 1a shows a gray scale exam-\nple of the resulting imagery. Since the images have 60%\noverlap, full coverage of the 80 km study reach can still be\nachieved by using every other image. Therefore 2092\nimages were used in this study. Precise georegistration of\nthe images was not available and it was not possible to set a\nsufficient number of georeferenced control points in the\nfield because of the sheer number (>6000) that would have\nbeen necessary. However, for each image, the helicopter\nposition was recorded with the onboard GPS system.\nTherefore the position of each image center point is known.\n2.2. Validation Data\n[10] An independent set of grain size data was collected\nin the field to provide validation for the automated grain\nsize measurements in submerged areas. Georeferenced\nmanual samples of the surface grain size within the wetted\nperimeter were conducted at 39 field sites. For each site, 10\nclasts were randomly extracted from the river bed in a 1 m2\narea and manually measured along the b axis. Water depth\nwas measured for each site. Spatially, the sampling sites\nwere scattered over approximately 20 km. Therefore each\nsite is located in a different image and 39 images were\nprocessed. Each of these images was manually georefer-\nenced with ARCMAP GIS software in order to position the\ndata sites on the image. The estimated error of this process\nwas \u00b129.7 cm.\n[11] The measurements of Davey and Lapointe (C. E.\nDavey and M. F. Lapointe, Geography Department, McGill\nUniversity, Application of the sedimentary link concept on\nthe Sainte-Marguerite River: Preliminary findings, unpub-\nlished report, 2004, hereinafter referred to as Davey and\nLapointe, unpublished report, 2004) were used as additional\nvalidation data in relation to the overall system-scale\nvariability in grain size. This study established a field-based\ncharacterization of the sedimentary links on the Sainte-\nMarguerite River. It operated by bulk sampling of river\nbed material and field observations along the river channel\nmade possible by the access road. These allowed the authors\nto locate link transitions defined as transitions from sand or\nfine particles to boulder rapids. The extent of sedimentary\nlinks presented in this report is qualitatively compared with\nthe automated long profile to determine if the sedimentary\nlinks can be identified with automated grain size mapping.\nThus, rather than the detailed quantitative validation implied\nin the sampling of grain sizes, the Davey and Lapointe\n(unpublished report, 2004) data allow us to assess the extent\nto which the method we develop is sufficient for geomor-\nphological investigation of the kind conventionally under-\ntaken using field sampling.\n2.3. Image Classification\n[12] The automated image classification algorithm dis-\ncussed by Carbonneau et al. [2004], capable of identifying\ndry areas in an image, was developed further to perform\nautomated classifications that could distinguish between\nvegetated and wetted areas. This algorithm operates in the\nMATLAB environment, as do all the methods presented in\nthis paper. First, built-in MATLAB functions are used to\ntransform the RGB color image to hue-saturation-intensity\n(HSI) format. The transformation from RGB to HSI format\nis analogous to the transformation from Cartesian to polar\ncoordinates [Castleman, 1996]. In the HSI format, the color\nof a pixel is represented by an Intensity which is a vector\nnorm combined with Hue and Saturation values which are\nequivalent to orbital and azimuthal angles in polar coordi-\nnates. The automated image segmentation procedure works\nby automated histogram partitions in the Hue and Intensity\nW11426 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: SIZE MEASUREMENTS OF FLUVIAL GRAIN SIZES\n3 of 9\nW11426\nbands. Examination of the Hue band histograms for the\nimage set revealed that three distinct modes were generally\npresent. The first mode corresponds to a merging of dry\nexposed sediment and optically shallow wetted sediment.\nThe second mode corresponds to the vegetated area and the\nthird mode corresponds to the optically deep wetted areas.\nAn automated histogram partition was performed with a\nmimima finding function based on numerical derivatives.\nThis allowed for three initial classes to be established:\nmerged dry and optically shallow water, vegetated and\noptically deep water. Then attention was focused on the\nintensity band. It was found that if vegetated and deep water\nareas are masked out, the remaining histogram has two\nmodes, one for the dry area and one for shallow area.\nTherefore automated partitioning of these two modes\nallowed for the areas and shallow areas to be classified.\n[13] The precision of this classification procedure was\nestimated by randomly taking 10 images and comparing the\nautomated classification with a manual classification where\nimage classes were delimited by hand. Image pixels were\nthen labeled as 1 for a correct classification and 0 for a false\nclassification. This resulted in approximately 80% of pixels\nbeing correctly classified. The results of this quality esti-\nmation were not encouraging and led to the conclusion that\nthe automated classification outputs needed to be corrected.\nSince the implementation of advanced automated classifi-\ncation algorithms was not a priority for this research, it was\ndecided to correct the image classifications manually.\nTherefore a semiautomated interface was designed in the\nMATLAB environment to allow for a rapid and efficient\nediting process. This interface was designed to manage\nrepetitive tasks such as image uploading and saving while\ntaking advantage of human pattern recognition skills to\nidentify and correct classification errors. The interface dis-\nplays both the image and the raw classification image. The\nuser can then rapidly correct classification errors by drawing\ndirectly on the image. With this interface, a single user can\nedit approximately 200 image classifications per day.\n2.4. Extension of Semivariance\nMapping to Wet Areas\n[14] Examination of Figure 1a shows that, in the wetted\narea, portions of the bed are visible through the water\ninterface. This suggests that textural information is still\npresent and that grain size estimations could still be carried\nout. Therefore the method established by Carbonneau et al.\n[2004] is applied to the shallow wetted areas in order to test\nthis hypothesis. Before applying the method, two factors\nmust be considered. First, is equation (1) valid for sub-\nmerged grains? Second, is the local semivariance window\nsize (33 \u0001 33 pixels) used to obtain equation (1) appropriate\nfor submerged grains? Since it can be expected that the\naddition of a water interface will dampen the semivariance\nsignal, it is highly unlikely that equation (1) will remain\nvalid for submerged grains. Therefore the relationship\nbetween local semivariance and median grain size will need\nto be recalibrated. With respect to the appropriate window\nsize, the work presented by Carbonneau et al. [2004]\nconcluded that successful calibration was dependent on\nseveral factors. First, the sampling window must be suffi-\nciently large to get a stable semivariance signal. Second, the\ngravel patches under consideration must be uniform on a\nspatial scale similar to that of the sampling window and of\nthe calibration data sampling area. Finally, the smallest\ndetectable grain size should be greater than the image\nresolution. These factors are not affected by the addition\nof the water interface and it was decided to retain the 33 \u0001\n33 pixel window size for the purposes of recalibration.\n[15] Given the quality of the results in the dry bed area, the\nestimated dry bed grain size mapping results were used to\ngenerate calibration points. In order to do this, it was\nassumed that the grain size on either side of the wet\/dry\ninterface was approximately equal if the gravel patches were\nvisibly uniform. The test site used by Carbonneau et al.\n[2004] was once again selected. Therefore large visibly\nuniform patches straddling the wet dry interface, in the five\nimages necessary to get complete coverage of the test site,\nwere identified. The grain size estimation algorithm was then\nused to measure the grain size in the dry area of the uniform\npatches. Additionally, the semivariance mapping algorithm\nwas used to produce a semivariance map of the wetted area\nin the uniform patches. An algorithm programmed to follow\nthe wet\/dry interface was then used to subdivide the uniform\npatches into control data. For each meter length of the wet\/\ndry interface, the algorithm stored the grain size in the\nadjacent 1 m2 dry area and the semivariance in the adjacent\n1 m2 wet area. In this manner, 216 calibration points, each\nwith a surface of 1 m2, were collected from five images.\n2.5. Automated Grain Size Measurement\nProcessing Chain\n[16] Provided the calibration and validation of individual\ngrain size maps gives satisfactory results in the wetted\noptically shallow area, all the images in the data set will\nneed to be processed. As stated earlier, all the processing\nis done in the MATLAB environment. First, a built-in\nMATLAB function is used to transform the RGB image to\n8-bit gray scale. Then the edited image classification is used\nto isolate the dry area and the shallow wetted area in the\ngray scale image. Each of these image classes is then copied\ninto a new blank image with all other class pixels initially\nset to zero. This results in a first image with only the dry\narea, the dry class image, and a second image with only the\nshallow area, the shallow class image. Before proceeding to\nthe semivariance mapping, the mean brightness value for\neach image class is calculated. Then, the zero value pixels\nfor a given class image are set to the corresponding mean\nbrightness value. This is done in order to minimize the edge\ncontrast between the masked area and the class-imaged area.\nSemivariance mapping is then carried out on both images by\napplying a windowed local semivariogram equation as\ndescribed by Carbonneau et al. [2004]. The semivariance\nmaps are then converted to grain size maps. Equation (1) is\nused to convert the dry class image semivariogram map to\ngrain sizes and the calibration relationship obtained for the\nshallow area, given further as equation (2) is used to convert\nthe shallow class image to grain sizes.\n2.6. Automated Long Profile Measurements\n[17] The resulting grain size maps can then be used to\nextract grain sizes in a downstream direction. A profiling\nalgorithm was developed in the MATLAB environment to\nautomatically perform this task. First, the channel is ap-\nproximated as being linear at the scale of a single image.\nThen the image classification algorithm is used to find the\nchannel and its orientation in the image. Once the orienta-\n4 of 9\nW11426 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: SIZE MEASUREMENTS OF FLUVIAL GRAIN SIZES W11426\ntion of the channel is known, a rotation algorithm is used to\nrotate the image in order to position the channel in a vertical\norientation. This systematically places the channel in the\nsame orientation as the pixel grid and thus simplifies the\ndetermination of the grain size sampling distances. The new\nrotated image is then divided into horizontal sampling area\nslices having a downstream length corresponding to the\nuser specified sampling distance. Finally, the algorithm\ncalculates the median grain size of all available automated\ngrain size measurements within each sampling slice. This\nentire process is fully automated and can therefore be\nrepeated for all the grain size maps.\n[18] The position along the channel of each grain size\nmeasurement was then established from the GPS coordinates\nof each image center. These geographic GPS coordinates\nwere first converted into a 1D \u2018\u2018km\u2019\u2019 river coordinate system\ngiving the distance upstream, along the river path, from the\nriver mouth to each image. Then this distance from the river\nmouth and the pixel size were used to calculate the km rating\nof each sampling area slice thus allowing the profiling\nalgorithm to output grain size as a function of distance\nupstream.\n2.7. Overall Feasibility, Costs, and Processing Times\n[19] While centimeter-scale resolution imagery is re-\nquired for this method, such imagery is not difficult to\nobtain with current airborne remote sensing technology. For\nthe present study, image acquisition cost is evaluated at\napproximately 200 US$ per river kilometer at 2005 prices,\nincluding both image acquisition and helicopter time. How-\never, researchers considering applying these methods\nshould note that if only short reaches are to be imaged,\ninitial mobilization costs will make this figure increase by as\nmuch as an order of magnitude. Similarly, image surveys of\nvery wide river systems may incur higher costs because of\nthe necessity of multiple parallel flight lines. In addition to\nthe air surveys, the work described here required roughly\n4\u20135 person weeks of field work to collect the necessary\ncalibration and validation data. In the preprocessing phase,\nclassification edition required roughly 0.2 person\/days per\nriver kilometer and the processing time for grain size map\nproduction is approximately 4 hours per river kilometer on a\ncurrent desktop PC. Finally, long profile extraction requires\napproximately 20 min per river kilometer.\n3. Results\n[20] Figure 2 shows the results of the calibration model-\ning. It can be seen that the relationship between local\nsemivariance and median grain size is highly significant.\nThe equation giving the median diameter as a function of\nlocal semivariance of the wetted region is\nD50 \u00bc 1:33SV\u00fe 18:95; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere D50 is the median diameter of surface particles, in\nmm, in the 1 m2 area and SV is the dimensionless local\nvariance sill value in the corresponding 1 m2 area of the\nimage. As hypothesized, the steeper slope in (2) as\ncompared with (1) reflects the dampening of the semivar-\niance signal in wetted areas as compared with dry areas,\nresulting in a greater change of D50 for a smaller change in\nsemivariance. The level of explanation in the relationship is\n85% (Figure 2) and this is sufficient for it to be used to\nestimate grain size in the wetted perimeter. Figure 3 shows\nthe wetted median grain size maps obtained from the\napplication of equation (2) to the whole wetted area in\nFigure 1a.\n[21] Equation (2) was then used to process the 39\nvalidation site images. The grain size values predicted by\nthe algorithm were then compared with the values observed\nin the field. Figure 4 shows the model validation results.\nObserved grain size is plotted versus predicted grain sizes.\nThe mean of the error gives a bias of \u00068 mm and the\nstandard deviation of the error yields a precision of\n\u00b129 mm.\n[22] The full set of 2092 images was then processed in\norder to obtain grain size maps for the entire river. Depth\nmeasurements collected for a separate paper [Carbonneau et\nal., 2005] have allowed us to establish that the riverbed is\noptically shallow at depths of approximately 150 cm.\nAutomated grain size measurements therefore cover all\ndepths from 0 cm (i.e., dry areas) to 150 cm. In total, the\ngrain size maps calculated for both the shallow wetted and\nFigure 2. Calibration model for grain size estimation in\nsubmerged areas.\nFigure 3. Median grain size map for the submerged areas\nof Figure 1a.\nW11426 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: SIZE MEASUREMENTS OF FLUVIAL GRAIN SIZES\n5 of 9\nW11426\ndry areas of the whole river covered 86% (Table 1) of the\nactive channel surface with 3.04 million, 1 m resolution,\nautomated grain size measurements, evenly spaced in both\ndownstream and cross-stream directions. The profiling\nalgorithm was then applied to construct a long profile of\nmedian grain size with a regular 20 m sample spacing.\nFigure 5 shows the resulting long profile with vertical\nbars representing the link cutoff points as determined\nindependently from field survey by Davey and Lapointe\n(unpublished report, 2004). The profile in Figure 5 has\n4047 median grain size points. Among these, approximately\n100 (\u00072.5% of total) gross outliers can be observed. The\ncorrespondence between field-based link cutoff points and\nautomatically measured grain size variations is very good.\nUnfortunately, short data gaps can be seen in the long profile\nin the vicinity of km points 18 and 80. These represent short\nperiods of camera malfunctions where no image data are\navailable.\n4. Discussion\n[23] When compared with Carbonneau et al. [2004] there\nis a degradation in the quality of the application of the\nmethod to subaqueous zones. There are three potential\ncauses of this degradation: the effect of water depth on\nerror, the effect of particle size on error, and the effect of\nsubstrate composition on error.\n[24] The presence of a water interface will predictably\ndegrade the quality of the automated grain size mapping\nresults. Figure 6a shows a plot of the validation residuals\n(i.e., predicted D50 minus observed D50) versus depth. The\npresence of nonlinear trend, with notably greater residual\nerror at greater depths, suggests poorer grain size estimates\nin deeper parts of the flow. A depth-dependent calibration\nmay be valuable for future applications, but this will require\nlarger calibration data sets with a range of both depth and\ngrain size information allowing for a grain size model which\nis a function of both local semivariance and local depth\nmeasurements.\n[25] Closer examination of Figure 6a reveals that shal-\nlowest parts of the flow, with depths roughly below 50 cm,\nseem to have a systematic overestimation (negative error) of\nparticle size while deeper parts of the flow have a systematic\nunderestimation of particle size. Following this observation,\naccuracy and precision were re-estimated for flow depths\nbelow 50 cm and above 50 cm. For flow depths below\n50 cm, accuracy and precision were estimated at \u00068 mm\nand \u00b113 mm, respectively. For flow depths above 50 cm,\naccuracy and precision were estimated at +10 mm and\n\u00b115 mm, respectively. Therefore the precision of wetted\narea grain size estimates in the first 50 cm of the flow is\nsimilar to that of the dry bed areas (\u00b111 mm [Carbonneau\net al., 2004]).\n[26] Closer examination of the grain size maps suggests\nthat the median grain size of very coarse bed patches tends\nto be underestimated. Figure 6b shows a plot of the\nvalidation residuals vs. observed median diameter. A strong\ncorrelation between the error and the particle size is found\nup to values somewhere between 80 and 90 mm. This\nshows that the current median grain size estimation model\nbecomes less reliable as bed material gets coarser, although\nthe reliability does not continue to degrade for grain sizes\ngreater than 90 mm. This effect can be explained by the\nrelative areas of single particles and the semivariance\nmapping window. As bed material becomes coarser, the\narea of a single particle relative to the search window\nbecomes more important. Thus fewer particles are contained\nFigure 4. Validation results for the submerged grain size\nmodel.\nFigure 5. Long profile of median grain size showing link cutoff points (vertical lines), numbered 1\u20138\nas determined by Davey and Lapointe (unpublished report, 2004) and an example of an \u2018\u2018error column\u2019\u2019\nstructure caused by glare at the water surface.\n6 of 9\nW11426 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: SIZE MEASUREMENTS OF FLUVIAL GRAIN SIZES W11426\nwithin the search window. Since contrast and semivariance\nlevels are produced by the shaded area on the edge of\nparticles, reducing the number of particles in the window\nlikely reduces the semivariance and thus changes the\ncalibration relationship. This suggests that the calibration\nrelationship should not be linear. The apparent linear trend\nin the current calibration might be explained by an insuffi-\ncient number of very coarse, boulder type, bed patches in\nthe data set. Future applications of this method should\ntherefore endeavor to have a higher number of coarse sized\npoints in the calibration data set to allow for any nonlinear\ntrend to become apparent.\n[27] Variations in substrate composition could also ac-\ncount for some of the error of this method. Legleiter et al.\n[2004] have noted that different rock types have different\nradiative transfer properties and thus it would be reasonable\nto suggest that changes in rock type could alter local image\nproperties. However, in the present case, the uniform\nlithological mix of the area makes this possibility less likely.\nAn additional effect that can be included in substrate\ncomposition is the presence of algae growth such as\nperiphyton. Legleiter et al. [2004] found that periphyton\nhas different radiative transfer properties to those of gravels.\nField observations clearly show that periphyton has a darker\ncolor than surrounding clean rocks and therefore it is likely\nthat the presence of localized periphyton altered local\ncontrasts and induced error.\n[28] Comparison of the automated profile and field-based\nidentification of link cutoff points (vertical bars in Figure 5)\nshows good agreement thus giving further validation to the\nmethod. Examination of the link cutoff bars shows that\ncutoffs 1, 3 7 and 8 have an excellent visual correspondence\nwith automatically measured grain sizes. In the cases of link\ncutoff bars 2, 4, 5 and 6, field observations confirm that the\ngrain size changes were subtler. Closer examinations of\nFigure 5 does show that smaller-scale grain size variations\ncan be observed at link cutoff points 2, 4, 5 and 6.\nFurthermore, Figure 5 shows multiple structures not asso-\nciated with known sedimentary links. It must therefore be\ndetermined if these structures are of natural origin or\nassociated with measurement errors. At the downstream\nend of the profile, from 0 to 18 km, an important structure\nof upstream fining can be seen in Figure 5. Field inves-\ntigations in this area have confirmed the existence of this\nstructure and established that the river gradually cuts into a\nglacial till with very coarse particles. Therefore this up-\nstream fining structure reflects a localized input of sediment,\nwhich is too coarse to be mobilized by the river. Another\nexample of a valid structure not associated with sedimentary\nlinks can be seen in Figure 5 between link cutoffs 6 and 7.\nHere a cycle of coarsening and fining can be observed in the\nmiddle of the link. During the link identification work of\nDavey and Lapointe (unpublished report, 2004), this struc-\nture had not been found since it was in an area where access\nto the river was more difficult. Therefore it was initially\nthought that this feature in the automated profile was\nerroneous. However, subsequent field investigations found\nthat this structure was real. As a consequence, the link\ndefinitions were updated and a new link cutoff point was\nadded. This demonstrates that, in certain cases, remote\nsensing methods can be more accurate than the field\nsampling methods which are traditionally used to validate\nthem. In particular, when field sites are inaccessible, remote\nsensing\u2013based methods will bring important advantages in\naccuracy and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, the presence\nof smaller structures in the grain size profile of Figure 5\nshows that automated grain size mapping could be used to\ninvestigate smaller-scale features. For example, continuous\ngrain size mapping and the resulting long profile could be\nused to study the pool riffle sequence on a much larger scale\nand with a much improved sampling resolution than has\nbeen previously possible.\n[29] While field observations have established that valid\nsmall-scale structures can be measured with automated\ngrain size mapping, certain features in Figure 5 are associ-\nated with errors and the examination of the long profile in\nFigure 5 shows that a relatively small number of outliers\n(i.e., \u0007100 points out of 4047) are present. These outliers\nwere investigated by examining the source image and\ncorresponding grain size map. This examination revealed\nthat glary reflections on the water surface are an important\nsource of error in the process. First, a uniform glare on the\nsurface masks the river bed and replaces it with a low-\nFigure 6. Structured residuals: (a) Scatterplot of validation\nresiduals versus depth and (b) scatterplot of validation\nresiduals versus size.\nW11426 CARBONNEAU ET AL.: SIZE MEASUREMENTS OF FLUVIAL GRAIN SIZES\n7 of 9\nW11426\ncontrast area which is falsely interpreted as fine material.\nSecond, in wave-generating windy conditions, glary reflec-\ntions occur on wave crests only, leaving the troughs of the\nwaves dark. This leads to a highly textured light-dark\npattern on the water surface which is falsely interpreted as\ncoarse submerged clasts and causes an important overesti-\nmation of grain sizes. These overestimations of grain size\ntend to be tightly clustered into groups and can be seen in\nFigure 5 as \u2018\u2018error columns.\u2019\u2019 Figure 5 shows an example of\nsuch structures. Removal of these structures is difficult to\nautomate and best carried out manually. Careful examina-\ntion of the source imagery shows that the glare effect is not\na binary phenomena which is either fully present or fully\nabsent, glare intensity is a continuum and glare was found to\nbe present in large areas at weak levels. This makes the\nestablishment of a threshold for automated glare detection\ndifficult and justifies the use of manual removal. In addition\nto a manual removal of glary points during postprocessing,\nsteps to alleviate glare related errors can be implemented\nduring data collection. A polarizing filter can be added to\nthe camera lens to eliminate reflections from the water\nsurface. This should minimize the presence of glary reflec-\ntions and reduce the work needed in the postprocessing\nphase.\n5. Conclusion\n[30] It has been demonstrated that automated image\nprocessing methods can yield grain size information in\ncoarse, optically shallow fluvial environments. Furthermore,\nthe examination of the validation residuals has yielded\nadditional insights into the workings of this grain size\nmeasurement method that could potentially lead to im-\nproved performance in future applications. Additionally,\nthis paper has shown that such methods could be applied\non a larger scale to study grain size variations along the\nentire channel length. The methods presented here therefore\noffer an unprecedented combination of meter-scale sam-\npling resolution continuously applied to kilometer-scale\nareas.\n[31] Acknowledgments.
