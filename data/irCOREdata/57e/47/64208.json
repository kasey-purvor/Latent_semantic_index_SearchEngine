Recruitment of toothfish varies inter-13 \nannually, and a single large cohort dominated during the four years surveyed. Most 14 \njuveniles were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf to the NW of South Georgia, with fish 15 \nsubsequently dispersing to deeper water around both the South Georgia and Shag 16 \nRocks shelves.  Mean size of juvenile toothfish increased with depth of capture.  17 \nStomach contents analysis was conducted on 795 fish that contained food remains and 18 \nrevealed that juvenile toothfish are essentially piscivorous, with the diet dominated by 19 \nnotothenid fish.  The yellow-finned notothen, Patagonotothen guntheri, was the 20 \ndominant prey at Shag Rocks whilst at South Georgia, where P. guntheri is absent, the 21 \ndominant prey were Antarctic krill and notothenid fish.  The diet changed with size, 22 \nwith an increase in myctophid fish and krill as toothfish grow and disperse.

It is circumpolar in distribution, being found around 5 \nsub-Antarctic islands such as South Georgia, Heard Island and Kerguelen Island and 6 \nalso extends north onto the Patagonian shelf.  To the south it is replaced by the 7 \ncongeneric Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) which is found at high 8 \nlatitudes around the Antarctic continent (Gon and Heemstra 1990). 9 \n 10 \nPatagonian toothfish reach large size (> 2 m; > 100 kgs) and are long lived with adult 11 \nfish believed to reach 50 years old (Horn 2002).  Growth is relatively quick for the 12 \nfirst 10 years, while the fish inhabit relatively shallow water, but following the onset 13 \nof maturity (700-800 mm total length (TL)) growth is very slow.   Spawning is 14 \nthought to occur in deep-water, with both eggs and larvae pelagic (Evseenko et al. 15 \n1990).  16 \n 17 \nThe large size of toothfish, coupled with high quality flesh, led to the development, in 18 \nthe mid 1980\u2019s, of a valuable long-line fishery, targeting large adult fish in deep water 19 \n(>500 m)(Agnew 2004).  The fishery began in Chilean waters, but rapidly expanded 20 \nto cover the geographic range of toothfish (Agnew 2004).   At South Georgia the 21 \nlong-line fishery began in 1988, targeting large adult fish in deep-water although 22 \ntoothfish had previously been taken in bottom trawls on the shelf.  Since the mid 23 \n1990\u2019s the fishery has been managed under the auspices of the Commission for the 24 \nConservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), with mean annual 25 \ncatches of around 4000 tonnes (Agnew 2004).   26 \n 4\n 1 \nEcologically sustainable management of a fishery requires an understanding of the 2 \ndistribution and ecology of the exploited species throughout the life cycle and 3 \ninteractions with other species in the ecosystem, and this underpins CCAMLR\u2019s 4 \necosystem approach to fisheries management (Constable et al. 2000).   Whilst the 5 \ndistribution and ecology of the adult part of the toothfish population has been 6 \nelucidated through the fishery (e.g. Pilling et al. 2001; Agnew 2004) and the use of 7 \nbaited cameras (Yau et al. 2002; Collins et al. 2006), the distribution and ecology of 8 \nthe pre-recruits or juveniles is poorly documented. 9 \n 10 \nThe diet of Patagonian toothfish has been studied across its geographic range 11 \n(Duhamel 1981; McKenna 1991; Garcia de la Rosa et al. 1997; Goldsworthy et al. 12 \n2001; Pilling et al. 2001; Goldsworthy et al. 2002; Arkhipkin et al. 2003; Barrera-Oro 13 \net al. 2005), but most of these studies have focused on adult toothfish from the 14 \nfishery.   At South Georgia adult toothfish (> 750 mm TL) are thought to be 15 \nopportunistic predators and scavengers (Pilling et al. 2001), but data on the diet of 16 \nfish prior to entering the fishery (TL ~ 750 mm) is limited to a study from a single 17 \nsurvey in March-April 1996 (Barrera-Oro et al. 2005).    18 \n 19 \nHere we examine the distribution and diet of pre-recruit toothfish from trawl surveys 20 \nundertaken at South Georgia and Shag Rocks in four consecutive seasons and 21 \nconsider the role of toothfish in the South Georgia ecosystem. 22 \n 23 \n 24 \nMaterials and methods 25 \n 26 \n 5\nDuring January 2003, 2004, 2005 & 2006 bottom trawl surveys were undertaken on 1 \nthe FPRV Dorada in the area of South Georgia and Shag Rocks.  South Georgia is 2 \nsituated between the Polar Front and the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current 3 \nFront (SACCF), with circulation generally flowing from west to east in the Antarctic 4 \nCircumpolar Current (see Fig. 1).  The surveys used a commercial sized otter trawl 5 \n(FP-120), which was fished, during daylight, for approximately 30 minutes at each 6 \nstation.  The trawl had a headline height of 4 m, and fished with a wingspread of 18-7 \n20 m and a cod-end mesh of 40 mm.   In January 2003 trawl stations were arranged in 8 \na series of transects radiating away from the island and covering depths of 100-900 m.  9 \nIn 2004-06 the trawl stations were arranged in a random, stratified design, to assess 10 \nthe abundance of mackerel icefish and pre-recruit toothfish. 11 \n 12 \nDuring all surveys, all captured toothfish were sampled, and were measured (to 10 13 \nmm category below), weighed and sexed.  Except in 2003, when a subsample was 14 \ntaken, all toothfish stomachs that contained any food items were carefully dissected 15 \nfrom the fish, and immediately frozen at \u201320oC.   16 \n 17 \nIn the laboratory stomachs were thawed and the total contents weighed prior to being 18 \nsorted into species or species groups.  Contents were identified to the lowest 19 \ntaxonomic level using published guides (Hulley 1981; Nesis 1987; Gon and Heemstra 20 \n1990) and reference collections.  Partially digested fish were identified from sagital 21 \notoliths using reference material and published guides (Hecht 1987; Reid 1996). 22 \nPartially digested cephalopods were identified using reference collections of beaks.   23 \nIndividual prey items were weighed and measured (total length (TL) for fish; mantle 24 \nlength (ML) for cephalopods), with the size of highly digested prey estimated from 25 \n 6\notolith to length relationships (Hecht 1987; Reid 1996).  Items that were completely 1 \nundigested were considered to represent trawl feeding and were excluded from 2 \nsubsequent analyses.   3 \n 4 \nDiet was expressed using percent mass (% M), percent frequency of occurrence (% 5 \nF), percent number (% N) and percent index of relative importance (% IRI: see 6 \n(Cortes 1996)). Percent mass was based on the weight of the prey found in the 7 \nstomach and not on reconstituted mass. 8 \n 9 \nPercent mass:      100%\n1\n\u00d7=\n\u2211\n=\nn\ni\ni\ni\ni\nM\nMM  10 \nPercent frequency of occurrence:  100% \u00d7=\nS\nF\nF ii  11 \nS = number of stomachs containing food remains 12 \nPercent number:    100%\n1\n\u00d7=\n\u2211\n=\nn\ni\ni\ni\ni\nN\nNN  13 \n 14 \nPercent index of relative importance:  100\n%)%(%\n%)%(%%\n1\n\u00d7\n\u00d7+\n\u00d7+=\n\u2211\n=\nn\ni\niii\niii\ni\nFMN\nFMNIRI  15 \n 16 \nStatistical analyses were undertaken using the statistical software MINITAB Release 17 \n14 and Sigma Plot 9.01.  Inter-annual comparisons of stomach fullness (expressed as 18 \n% body weight) were investigated using a one-way ANOVA on arcsin-transformed 19 \ndata. Regression analyses were undertaken to investigate the relationships between 20 \ndepth (independent) and fish length and between toothfish size (independent) and prey 21 \n 7\nsize.  Assumptions about normality and constant variance were tested prior to 1 \nanalyses.  2 \n 3 \n 4 \n5 \n 8\nResults 1 \n 2 \nDistribution of juvenile toothfish 3 \n 4 \nJuvenile Patagonian toothfish (< 750 mm TL) were found throughout the South 5 \nGeorgia and Shag Rocks shelves, but the density of juvenile fish was considerably 6 \ngreater on the Shag Rocks shelf, where 84 % of the juveniles were caught (Table 1; 7 \nFigs 2, 3).  Toothfish comprised 2.8-9.1 % (by weight) of the fish catches at Shag 8 \nRocks and 0.7-6.7 % of catches at South Georgia (Table 2).  No Antarctic toothfish 9 \n(Dissostichus mawsoni) were caught during the surveys. 10 \n 11 \nIn each year the catch was dominated by a single cohort that was of size 200-250 mm 12 \nin 2003 (putative 1+ yr old), 300-360 mm in 2004, 380-460 mm in 2005 and 430-530 13 \nmm in 2006 (Fig. 3). A second, numerically smaller, cohort was seen in 2003 at 14 \naround 400 mm TL, which was present in small numbers in 2005 and 2006.  A third 15 \ncohort was detected in 2006 at size 260-340 mm (putative 2+ years old) that was not 16 \nseen the previous year. 17 \n 18 \nJuvenile fish were generally confined to the continental shelf areas, with the largest 19 \ncatches taken at depths of less than 300 m and larger fish were more frequently caught 20 \nat South Georgia (Fig. 3).  For trawls that caught 3 or more Patagonian toothfish, 21 \nmean size increased significantly with depth of capture (regression: F= 43.61; 22 \nP<0.001; Fig. 4), and although large fish are occasionally caught in shallow water, 23 \nsmaller fish are restricted to shallow depths. 24 \n 25 \nDiet of juvenile toothfish 26 \n 27 \n 9\nStomach fullness was generally high, and less than 25 % of stomachs were empty (23 1 \n% in 2004, 19% in 2005; 24% in 2006).  Average stomach fullness (ratio of stomach 2 \nweight to body weight) was significantly higher in 2004 (2.52 % BW) than 2005 (1.86 3 \n%) and 2006 (2.12 %)  (ANOVA: F= 4.632; p<0.01) (2003 excluded as full set of 4 \ndata not available). For stomachs containing food, contents weight averaged 2.78% of 5 \nbody weight (range 0.01-12.6%).  There was no relationship between stomach 6 \nfullness and time of day, but all trawls were conducted during daylight. 7 \n 8 \nStomach contents were examined from 795 toothfish that had full or partially full 9 \nstomachs, of which 636 were from fish caught at Shag Rocks and 159 from South 10 \nGeorgia caught fish.   The size distribution of sampled fish was approximately 11 \nproportional to the size range caught, with the exception of the small sized fish (200-12 \n250 mm TL) caught in 2003, which were under-represented.     13 \n 14 \nJuvenile toothfish (<750 mm) were predominantly ichthyophagous, with fish 15 \naccounting for 95 % of the diet by mass, 51 % numbers, 88 % frequency and 89 % 16 \nIRI (Table 3).    The diet composition differed between South Georgia and Shag 17 \nRocks (Table 3; Fig. 5), with more crustaceans taken at South Georgia, but this may 18 \nreflect the larger average size of fish caught off South Georgia compared to Shag 19 \nRocks (see above). At South Georgia more krill (52 % by number) was taken, but 20 \nwhen the diet is considered in terms of percent mass fish prey accounted for 89 % of 21 \nthe diet at South Georgia, compared to 97 % at Shag Rocks.   22 \n 23 \nThe fish component of the diet differed substantially between the two locations. At 24 \nShag Rocks the yellow-finned notothen (Patagonotothen guntheri) dominated the diet 25 \n 10\nin each of the years (85 % by mass; 95 % IRI).  Catches of both toothfish (Fig 2) and 1 \nP. guntheri (Fig 6) were highest at the eastern end of the Shag Rocks shelf, although 2 \nthere was no significant correlation between catches of the two species at Shag Rocks. 3 \nOn the South Georgia shelf the diet was more diverse with the notothenids 4 \nLepidonotothen larseni (20 % mass; 21 % IRI) and Trematomus hansoni (23 % mass; 5 \n3.9 % IRI) the main fish prey species.  Myctophid fish were also consumed, with 6 \nGymnoscopelus nicholsi and Protomyctophum bolini the most common species taken.  7 \nThere was a single incidence of southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis), 8 \nwhich is rarely found at South Georgia and a single incidence of an undescribed 9 \nspecies of the Chiasmodontidae genus Pseudoscopelus (Marcelo Melo pers. comm.; 10 \nspecimen lodged at the Natural History Museum, London: BMNH.2006.8.19.1). 11 \n 12 \nThe main crustacean prey species were Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), the 13 \nmysids (Antarctomysis ohlini and A. maxima) and the pelagic amphipod (Themisto 14 \ngaudichaudii), with the decapod, Notocrangon antarcticus, and isopods of the genus 15 \nNatatolana (Family Cirolanidae) occasionally taken.  Cephalopods were rare in the 16 \ndiet, with the octopus Adelieledone polymorpha and the squid Psychroteuthis glacialis 17 \nthe only species identified. 18 \n 19 \nOntogenetic changes in diet 20 \n 21 \nThe diet of toothfish changed with size at both Shag Rocks and South Georgia (Fig. 5: 22 \nnote sample sizes were smaller for larger fish and at South Georgia).  At Shag Rocks 23 \nthe diet of fish size < 500 mm TL was dominated by the notothenioid, 24 \nPatagonotothen guntheri, which reflects the association with the Shag Rocks shelf.  In 25 \n 11\nfish greater than 400 mm TL there was an increase in krill and myctophids.  At South 1 \nGeorgia, smaller fish consumed krill and other crustaceans, with larger fish taking 2 \nnotothenioid fish.   3 \n 4 \nFish prey size increased significantly with toothfish size (Regression: F= 83.571; 5 \np<0.001; n= 832; Fig. 7) but, more clearly, the range of prey sizes taken increased 6 \nwith fish size.  The main prey species, Patagonotothen guntheri, forms a cluster at 7 \nsizes 70-200 mm TL, consumed by toothfish of 200-600 mm TL, but the relationship 8 \nbetween predator size and prey size was still significant (Regression: F= 49.706; 9 \np<0.001; n= 546).  The larger prey items were other notothenioid fish, notably 10 \nTrematomus hansoni and Champsocephalus gunnari.  The myctophid prey, with the 11 \nexception of a single large Gymnoscopelus bolini were of small size.  The number of 12 \nprey items consumed also increased with predator size.   13 \n 14 \nThe length of Patagonotothen guntheri consumed by toothfish was generally slightly 15 \nsmaller than that caught by the survey (not illustrated), the exception being in 2005, 16 \nwhen the survey caught relatively smaller P. guntheri than in the previous seasons.  17 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 \n21 \n 12\nDiscussion 1 \n 2 \nDistribution 3 \nWhilst adult toothfish are distributed in deep-water all around South Georgia and 4 \nShag Rocks (Agnew et al. 1999; Agnew 2004), the data from this study suggest that 5 \nthe recruitment of juvenile toothfish occurs predominantly at Shag Rocks, with small 6 \nnumbers of juvenile fish caught on the South Georgia shelf, most notably at the SW 7 \nedge.  This is consistent with the data of Garcia de la Rosa et al. (1997), who only 8 \nfound small toothfish at Shag Rocks. Barrera-Oro et al. (2005) did catch some small 9 \nfish on the South Georgia shelf, but the majority of fish < 600 mm TL were caught on 10 \nthe Shag Rocks shelf. The association between toothfish recruitment and Shag Rocks 11 \nis not clear, but may be related to temperature and oceanography.  Water temperatures 12 \nat Shag Rocks are slightly warmer than on the South Georgia shelf (Collins, 13 \nunpublished) and, as the Patagonian toothfish is at the southern edge of its range, and, 14 \nunlike D. mawsoni, does not possess anti-freeze glycoproteins (Gon and Heemstra 15 \n1990), temperature may be a limiting factor.    16 \n 17 \nAlthough two other cohorts were detected, this study essentially monitored a 18 \ndominant cohort through four consecutive seasons.  The cohort, first detected at size 19 \n200-250 mm TL, where probably 1+ years old in 2003 and would therefore be 4+ in 20 \n2006 (Belchier, unpublished). The dominance of a single cohort through four years of 21 \nsampling suggests strong interannual variability in recruitment.   Toothfish are 22 \nthought to spawn in winter in deep-water around South Georgia and Shag Rocks 23 \n(Agnew et al. 1999).  The eggs and larvae are both pelagic, with developmental stages 24 \nthought to last 3 and 6 months respectively (Evseenko et al. 1995), and successful 25 \nrecruitment will be dependent on transport in near surface currents.  The 26 \n 13\noceanography of the Scotia Sea is highly complex (Fig. 1) and subject to inter-annual 1 \nvariability, which may be the main factor driving recruitment variability.  A detailed 2 \nanalysis of variability in growth and recruitment in Patagonian toothfish from 14 3 \nsurveys from 1987-2006 is in progress (Belchier & Collins in prep). 4 \n 5 \nIn common with other species that scavenge as adults (see Collins et al. (2005)), the 6 \nPatagonian toothfish has a bigger-deeper trend (Arkhipkin et al. 2003; Laptikhovsky 7 \net al. 2006), and although this study was largely focussed in shallow areas it showed a 8 \ndistinct pattern, which is supported by evidence from the fishery (Agnew et al. 1999).  9 \nLarger fish do occasionally occur in shallow water and fish over a metre in length 10 \nhave been caught in trammel nets in < 200 m depth in Cumberland Bay (pers. obs). 11 \n 12 \nDiet 13 \nAlthough this study only gives a summer snapshot of toothfish diet, it is clear that pre-14 \nrecruit toothfish in the South Georgia\/Shag Rocks area are essentially piscivorous, 15 \nwhich is largely consistent with previous studies in the area (Zhivov and Krivoruchko 16 \n1990; Barrera-Oro et al. 2005) and dietary studies of similar sized toothfish in other 17 \nparts of the range (Duhamel 1981; Garcia de la Rosa et al. 1997; Goldsworthy et al. 18 \n2002; Arkhipkin et al. 2003).   19 \n 20 \nThe difference in the specific composition of the toothfish diet between Shag Rocks 21 \nand South Georgia is largely a consequence of distinct differences in the ichthyofauna 22 \nbetween the two areas.  The Shag Rocks and South Georgia shelves are separated by a 23 \ndeep (~1500 m) channel, and many of the notothenids and channichthyids that are 24 \ncommon on the South Georgia shelf are rare or absent at Shag Rocks (see Table 2). At 25 \n 14\nShag Rocks the demersal fauna is less diverse and dominated by Lepidonotothen 1 \nsquamifrons, mackerel icefish and Patagonotothen guntheri, with the latter being 2 \nabsent from South Georgia (Gon and Heemstra 1990).  Lepidonotothen squamifrons 3 \nare, in some years, abundant at Shag Rocks and were the main fish prey identified by 4 \nBarrera-Oro et al. (2005), however they are usually large fish and maybe too large for 5 \na juvenile toothfish to consume.  Hence the most abundant fish species of suitable size 6 \nis usually P. guntheri and the dominance of this species in toothfish diet may simply 7 \nbe a consequence of the distribution of the two species, with conditions that favour 8 \ntoothfish recruitment also favouring P. guntheri. Both species are abundant at the 9 \neastern end of the Shag Rocks shelf, which may be more productive than other parts 10 \nof the Shag Rocks shelf.  Interestingly, on the Falkland shelf the congeneric 11 \nPatagonotothen ramsayi is the main prey of pre-recruit toothfish of sizes < 600 mm 12 \nTL (Arkhipkin et al. 2003).   13 \n 14 \nThe specific composition of the toothfish diet in this study differs from that identified 15 \nfrom sampling in March-April 1996 by Barrera-Oro et al. (2005) and from 1985-86 16 \nby Zhivov and Krivoruchko (1990). The Barrera-Oro et al. (2005) study found 17 \nLepidonotothen kempi (= L. squamifrons) to be the main toothfish prey at South 18 \nGeorgia and Shag Rocks and neither study found Patagonotothen guntheri to be so 19 \ndominant (10 % occurrence in Zhivov and Krivoruchko (1990) and not recorded by 20 \nBarrera-Oro et al. (2005)).  Differences between the studies may reflect seasonal or 21 \ninter-annual variability in prey availability, but in both of the other studies a large part 22 \nof the fish diet was unidentified (49 % unidentified in Barrera-Oro et al. (2005)).     23 \n 24 \n 15\nPatagonotothen guntheri, the dominant prey species at Shag Rocks, is a semi-pelagic 1 \nnotothenid that is one of the most abundant species caught during trawl surveys at 2 \nShag Rocks (Table 2), but is at the southern end of its range (Gon and Heemstra 3 \n1990).  It is a pelagic feeder, consuming large copepods (e.g. Rhincalanus gigas), 4 \npelagic amphipods (e.g. Themisto gaudichaudii) and krill (Collins, unpublished).  On 5 \nthe South Georgia shelf the most important prey species were Lepidonotothen larseni 6 \nand Trematomus hansoni, which also feed on macro-zooplankton. The mackerel 7 \nicefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), which is abundant at both South Georgia and 8 \nShag Rocks (Table 2) and is commercially fished, was only occasionally found in 9 \ntoothfish stomachs in this study.   10 \n 11 \nEven within the limited size range studied here, a change in diet with size of toothfish 12 \nwas detected.  The shift from Patagonotothen guntheri to other notothenioids is 13 \nassociated with dispersion of fish from Shag Rocks to the South Georgia shelf.  There 14 \nis also an increase in krill consumption and, to a lesser extent, myctophid fish 15 \n(particularly at Shag Rocks) with increased size.  The principal myctophid species 16 \ntaken was Gymnoscopelus nicholsi, which is a relatively large species (upto 180 mm 17 \nTL) abundant on the slope (300-1000 m) around South Georgia and Shag Rocks, and 18 \nalthough it is a pelagic species it is frequently caught in bottom trawls.   This dietary 19 \nchange is associated with the ontogenetic migration into deeper water, where the 20 \navailable prey will differ, for instance Patagonotothen guntheri are rarely caught in 21 \ndepths greater than 300m.  22 \n  23 \nThe migration to deep water is probably accompanied by changes in foraging 24 \nbehaviour as well as diet with large adults scavenging as well as taking live prey 25 \n 16\n(Garcia de la Rosa et al. 1997; Pilling et al. 2001; Arkhipkin et al. 2003), making 1 \nthem susceptible to baited long-lines and attracted to baited cameras (Collins et al. 2 \n1999,  2006; Yau et al. 2002).  Arkhipkin et al. (2003) suggested that larger toothfish 3 \ngenerally take less active prey than small toothfish, although adult fish are capable of 4 \nbursts of high speed swimming (Yau et al. 2002), and consequently the diet of the 5 \nlarger toothfish is considerably different from that of the juveniles.   At South Georgia 6 \nthe diet of adult fish appears more diverse than juveniles, with more cephalopods 7 \n(Onychoteuthidae, Gonatidae, Chiroteuthidae and octopods) and crustaceans (krill, the 8 \ndecapod Nauticaris sp. and isopods) taken (Garcia de la Rosa et al. 1997; Pilling et al. 9 \n2001).  The main fish families consumed were Myctophidae, Moridae and Zoarcidae, 10 \nbut in both studies over half the fish were not identified. 11 \n 12 \nAlthough the size of prey increased with size of toothfish, it is clear that it is the range 13 \nof prey size that increases, with the larger toothfish taking small prey as well as large 14 \nprey items.   The size of P. guntheri taken by toothfish was generally slightly smaller 15 \nthan that taken by the trawl survey and this is likely to be a consequence of both 16 \nselectivity of the trawl and selectivity by the toothfish.   17 \n 18 \nThe diet of juvenile toothfish comprised a mixture of both pelagic and demersal 19 \nspecies, and it is not known how much time toothfish spend foraging above the sea-20 \nfloor.  For instance the main prey species P. guntheri feeds pelagically, but is also 21 \ncaught in bottom trawls.  Time spent foraging above the sea-floor will clearly impact 22 \ntheir catchability in a bottom trawl, but potentially make toothfish more susceptible to 23 \ndiving predators (see below). 24 \n 25 \n 17\nGiven the importance of P. guntheri in the diet of toothfish recruits and the co-1 \noccurrence of the two species, it is likely that any exploitation of P. guntheri would 2 \nimpact on toothfish populations.  Fishing for P. guntheri at Shag Rocks is likely to 3 \nhave a by-catch of small toothfish, and the removal of a large biomass of P. guntheri 4 \nwould reduce the available food for toothfish.   Whilst there is currently no fishery for 5 \nP. guntheri it has been estimated that around 170 000 tonnes were fished from the 6 \nShag Rocks area between 1969 and 1990 (Anon 1990a, b; Kock 1992).  Currently a 7 \nrelatively small pelagic trawl fishery, targeting mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus 8 \ngunnari), operates on the South Georgia and Shag Rocks shelves, which does have the 9 \npotential to catch juvenile toothfish.  10 \n 11 \nThe role of toothfish in the South Georgia marine ecosytem 12 \nIn order to have an ecologically sustainable fishery it is important to have knowledge 13 \nof the diet of a target species and of potential predators that may be competing with 14 \nthe fishery.  Whilst knowledge of the diet of toothfish is now substantial, little is 15 \nknown about the predators of toothfish.  In shallow water, potential predators of 16 \njuveniles include king and gentoo penguins, fur and elephant seals, but with increased 17 \nsize and habitat depth the range of potential predators is likely to decline (Table 4).  18 \nFrom studies undertaken at on South Georgia, toothfish are rarely taken in the diets of 19 \nfur seals or penguins, and only are occasionally taken by these species elsewhere (see 20 \nTable 4). Toothfish have been reported in the diet of Weddell seals, of which there is 21 \na small population at South Georgia, and these are a potential predator.  Albatross and 22 \nwhite-chinned petrels are known to take toothfish, but these are, almost certainly, fish 23 \nthat escape from hooks or discards from fishing vessels.  In deeper water, the only 24 \nlikely predators are elephant seals, sperm whales and large squid such as the Antarctic 25 \n 18\ngiant squid, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni.   Both sperm and killer whales are known to 1 \ntake toothfish from longlines during hauling (Ashford et al. 1996; Kock et al. 2006; 2 \nPurves et al. 2004), but toothfish habitat is beyond the normal diving capabilities of 3 \nkiller whales.  Little is know about the ecology of Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, but 4 \nthese large squid are probably capable of catching and consuming large toothfish, and 5 \nare occasionally caught on long-line hooks at South Georgia (Collins, unpublished).  6 \nAlthough cannibalism was not recorded in this study it has been recorded in larger 7 \ntoothfish (Arkhipkin et al. 2003) and may occur between cohorts.   Overall the 8 \nevidence from predators indicates low levels of predation, which is a consequence of 9 \nthe depth distribution and size of the toothfish.  10 \n 11 \nAcknowledgements Thanks to Len Featherstone (Master) and the crew of the FPRV 12 \nDorada for their efforts during the surveys in 2003 and 2004.
