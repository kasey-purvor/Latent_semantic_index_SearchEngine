Uranium\ntetrafluoride (UF4) was reduced to metal by Mg.\nScrap metal was combusted in a furnace prior to\ndisposal as uranium oxide, which resulted in\nemissions of uranium oxide particulates to the\nenvironment (ATSDR, 2004). Contamination of\nthe suburban environment surrounding the NLI\nplant by DU is evident in air filters, surface soils,\nreservoir sediments, dusts and the urine of former\nemployees and some residents (Dietz, 1980; Jeter\nand Eagleson, 1980; Arnason and Fletcher, 2003;\nLo et al., 2006; Lloyd et al., 2008; Parrish et al.,\n2008; Lloyd et al., 2009).\nFrom the soil concentration data of Jeter and\nEagleson (1980), we estimated that at least 3.4\ntonnes of U was deposited within 1 km2 of the\nNLI plant (Parrish et al., 2008) and that the\ndistribution of contamination was controlled by\nprevailing winds (Lloyd et al., 2008). Soils and\ndusts from the vicinity of the NLI plant were\ncontaminated by the aerial deposition of anthro-\npogenic U particulates; the vast majority of this\ncontamination was deposited prior to 1980. From\n* E-mail: nsl3@alumni.leicester.ac.uk\nDOI: 10.1180\/minmag.2009.073.3.495\nMineralogical Magazine, June 2009, Vol. 73(3), pp. 495\u2013510\n# 2009 The Mineralogical Society\na sample of 115 particles, individually analysed\nby laser ablation-multicollector- inductively\ncoupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-MC-\nICP-MS), all were found to have DU isotope\nratios, n235U\/n238U = (1.5\u00012.4)610\u00013 (Lloyd et\nal., 2009). The aim of this research is to define the\npresent forms of contaminant U and to relate these\nto emission processes and their subsequent\nexposure in the terrestrial environment.\nThe primary concern for this radioactive and\ntoxic material is inhalation exposure. The lung is\nthe radiological \u2018target\u2019 for the less soluble U\ncompounds (e.g. UO2 and U3O8), the bones and\nkidney (also toxicological) for the more soluble\ncompounds (e.g. UO3) which enter the blood-\nstream via the lungs (Eidson, 1994). The Royal\nSociety concluded that for most battlefield DU\nexposure scenarios, the human-health risks were\nlow and affect a small number of people (The\nRoyal Society, 2001, 2002). The ATSDR found\nthat the inhalation of DU emissions from the NLI\nplant could have increased the risk of health\neffects for Colonie residents (ATSDR, 2004).\nDU particulates frommunitions\nHigh velocity DU metal projectiles, which are\ntypically an alloy of DU and 0.75 wt.% Ti, are\nused as armour-piercing munitions by British and\nAmerican tanks and American A-10 aircraft.\nThese DU \u2018kinetic energy penetrators\u2019 pierce\nheavy armour efficiently. Upon impact, the metal\ncombusts and a fraction is dispersed as uranium\noxide particulates (The Royal Society, 2001;\nBleise et al., 2003).\nWe aim to use the Colonie case-study as an\nanalogue for the contamination from munitions\nuse and to investigate the environmental fate of\nthis controversial contaminant. The Colonie site\nhas a relatively large contamination footprint\n(~100 km2); the area is readily accessible and the\ncontamination has been in the environment prior\nto 1984 (cf. the first reported deployment of\nmunitions was during the 1991 Gulf War).\nHowever, the Colonie particulates were generated\nin a furnace that probably did not achieve the high\npressures and temperatures (up to 3639 K, Patrick\nand Cornette, 1978) of munitions impacting\narmoured targets and the particles may therefore\ndiffer in composition and morphology. Their\ncombustion may have been less heterogeneous\nthan for munitions, which undergo an initial high\nenergy impact and interaction with armour\nmaterials, followed by combustion or low-temp-\nerature oxidation of fragments that perforate\nthrough the target, resulting in highly hetero-\ngeneous particle morphologies (Krupka et al.,\n2009). This study addresses one of the recom-\nmendations of The Royal Society (2002) that\ninformation should be obtained on the bioavail-\nability of DU particles. Colonie has also been\nproposed for health studies (e.g. Parrish et al.,\n2008) and further information on the nature of the\ncontamination is therefore desirable.\nA brief review of the literature pertaining to the\noxidation states of anthropogenic uranium oxide\nparticles from environmental samples and from\nDU munitions testing is presented in Table 1. We\nfocus on the combustive products, rather than the\ncorrosion products of uranium. However, the\norigin of environmental particles is not always\nclear from the literature. Although each individual\nstudy is limited by small sample size, particles\nfrom environmental samples tend to be dominated\nby UO2 and mixed UO2\u0001U3O8, but also include\nU3O8 and, rarely, uranyl species (U\n6+). The\nChernobyl particles revealed heterogeneity\nbetween rim and core, attributed to formation\nprocesses.\nAerosols from DU test-firing and combustion\nexperiments appear primarily to be U3O8. However,\nthese studies analysed bulk samples using X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) techniques. In XRD, peak overlaps\nfrom U3O8 and U4O9 can mask minor amounts of UO3\nand UO2 respectively (Krupka et al., 2009). Microfocus\nX-ray absorption techniques (mXAS) can analyse\nindividual particles and parts thereof, but fine\nparticulates represented in the bulk samples are less\nlikely to be located for analysis, potentially biasing the\nresults. XAS is capable of resolving U3O8 from UO3.\nThe significance of U speciation is discussed in\nthe next section. It is an aim of this study to\ndetermine the U speciation of particles from\nColonie environmental samples and to resolve\nheterogeneity where possible. We used mXAS\ntechniques, including: X-ray absorption near edge\nspectroscopy (XANES), which is sensitive to\noxidation state; and extended X-ray absorption\nfine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, which is a\nprobe of local atomic structure (Koningsberger\nand Prins, 1988).\nThe environmental behaviour of uranium oxides\nUraninite (hyperstoichiometric cubic\/tetragonal\nphase UO2 or UO2+x, where x <0.33) and other\nU4+ species have extremely low solubility under\nreducing conditions (Langmuir, 1997).

The differences in solubility\nbetween the U4+ and U6+ species are apparent in\nthe absorption rate classification of uranium\noxides for dose assessment from inhalation\nexposure. Ansoborlo et al. (2002) classified UO2\nand U3O8 as slow, Type S (ICRP, 1995), with\ndissolution half-lives in simulated lung fluid of at\nleast 700 days, U3O8 dissolving more rapidly than\nUO2. In contrast, UO3 has a dissolution half-life of\nless than 10 days and is classified as fast, Type F.\nThe initial rapid dissolution rates seen in in vitro\nlung fluid experiments (e.g. Mitchel and Sunder,\n2004; Parkhurst et al., 2004; Guilmette and Cheng,\n2009), may be accounted for by mixtures of\nparticle sizes, morphologies and oxide phases\nincluding surface products. Depleted uranium\naerosols generated from munitions impacting\narmoured targets had variable and complex\nsolubility in simulated extracellular fluids, with\ndissolution behaviour similar to either Type M\n(intermediate rate) or Type S (Parkhurst et al.,\n2004; Guilmette and Cheng, 2009). Thus, the\ndegree of oxidation and the process of oxidation\nare significant to both the environmental fate and\nbioaccessibility of uranium oxide contamination. It\nshould be noted however, that these experiments\ndo not simulate the action of macrophage\nlysosomes, which convert U3O8 to insoluble\nphosphate phases in vivo (Berry et al., 1997).\nStoichiometric UO2 oxidizes readily in air and\nfine powders can behave pyrophorically. At\nenvironmental temperatures, thin films (a few\nnm thick) of higher oxides form on UO2 in air;\nUO3 is thermodynamically favoured, but this\nreaction is limited by oxygen ion diffusion\n(McEachern and Taylor, 1998). Surface uranyl\n(UO2\n2+) ions are observed from the oxidation of\nhyperstoichiometric UO2 (UO2+x) in moist air at\n353 K (Schueneman et al., 2003). Polycrystalline\nUO2.05 has also been observed to oxidize\npartially, over 15 y in ambient conditions, to\nUO3.2H2O (metaschoepite) (Wadsten, 1977).\nThe uranium dioxide fluorite-type cubic lattice\nand its derivatives (UO2+x) accommodate inter-\nstitial oxygen atoms in the range UO2\u0001UO2.33\/\nb-U3O7; higher oxides (U3O8\u0001UO3) adopt an\northorhombic lattice with lower density (Allen\nand Tempest, 1986). At elevated temperatures,\nbulk oxidation of UO2+x can occur, including\nU3O8 formation at temperatures greater than\nabout 523 K (McEachern and Taylor, 1998).\nUraninite (UO2+x) is the most common U ore\nmineral, but re-crystallization to orthorhombic\nU3O8 has never been reported in nature,\ndemonstrating the environmental stability of this\nmineral (Finch and Ewing, 1992). Thus, U3O8 and\nhigher oxides will not be formed in significant\nquantities from UO2+x in ambient air, but could\nhave formed in the NLI conversion furnace. The\nrate of U3O8 formation on UO2 powders is slow,\nforming as a major product at 533 K in around\n25 h (references in McEachern and Taylor, 1998).\nAnderson et al. (1955) compared the oxidized\nthin surface films on UO2 powders to those\nforming at low temperatures on other metals.\nPassive surface oxide films (nm thick) form on\nmetals such as Al, protecting the bulk metal from\nfurther oxidation; however these films are\nsusceptible to corrosion pitting. This process is\nautocatalytic in the presence of water and a strong\nanion, e.g. Cl\u0001 (Frankel, 1998). This process\nmight therefore promote oxidation and dissolution\nof uranium dioxide.\nMethodology\nSamples\nParticles of interest were concentrated from\ncontaminated dust and soil samples collected\nfrom the vicinity of the former NLI site in\nColonie. The dust samples for mXAS were\ncollected from a covered site at ground level,\nwhich has accumulated windblown material over\nseveral decades (it is possible that these samples\nwere occasionally saturated by rainwater). This\nsite afforded a large quantity of relatively\nconcentrated material (385S33 mg g\u00011 U, cf.\nnatural U concentrations in Colonie soils at\n~1 mg g\u00011). Other dry dust samples from\nresidential properties were collected by brushing\nor dry wiping material into clean polystyrene\ntubes. Soil samples were collected by hand-auger\nfrom the surface to a depth of 15 cm.\nSample preparation\nSample preparation methodology is detailed in\nLloyd et al. (2009) and summarized here. Soil\nsamples were dried at between 40 and 60\u00baC and\nsieved to <2 mm. Dense grains and particulates,\nincluding uranium oxides greater than approxi-\nmately 20 mm diameter, were concentrated by\ndense liquid separation (using di-iodomethane,\n498\nN. S. LLOYD ET AL.\nD = 3.3 g cm\u00013). Magnetic minerals, iron oxides\nand some zircons were removed by magnetic\nbarrier separation (Frantz LB-1). This metho-\ndology is rapid when compared to fission-track or\nsample splitting techniques.\nFor electron microscopy, both raw sample and\nconcentrates were mounted by dabbing the\nsurface of a carbon adhesive disc onto the\nsample material and lightly tapping to remove\nloose grains.\nFor XAS, an individual particle approach was\nrequired. From the dense concentrates, particles\nwith anthropogenic appearance, including sphe-\nrical particles, typically 20\u000180 mm in diameter\nand with a glassy or metallic lustre, were picked\nunder an optical microscope using fine tweezers.\nLarger, frosted and rounded quartz grains had\npreviously been removed by density separation.\nThe remaining natural dense minerals grains were\ntypically sub-angular, with irregular or crystalline\nhabit (including detrital zircons, garnet, rutile,\netc.). Picking was performed in a Petri dish with\nthe grains submerged in ethanol, the grains of\ninterest were transferred by pipette to a clean dish\nand the ethanol evaporated.\nThe particles of interest were then transferred\nby tweezers to a low-tack adhesive mount. For\nthis we used, as a substrate, Glue Dot Repo2\n(Keighley, UK), a proprietary craft material that\nappears clean and from which particles can easily\nbe removed without visible residue. The mounts\nwere then examined by SEM-EDXA. Uraniferous\ngrains were identified by the presence of U-Ma\nX-ray peaks.\nOf several thousand picked particles, fewer\nthan one in ten comprised U, with most of the rest\ncomprising Pb, Sn and\/or silica. The uraniferous\nparticles are typically opaque, dark grey with a\ndull metallic lustre; they tend to be fragile and\nsome are hollow shells. The uraniferous particles\nwere then transferred, embedded in epoxy resin\nand polished to reveal their cross-sections. Images\nfrom the sample preparation steps can be found in\nAppendix 2.7. Appendices are deposited with the\nPrincipal Editor of Mineralogical Magazine and\nare available from: www.minersoc.org\/pages\/\ne_journals\/dep_mat_mm.html.\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)\nStandards\nWe are not aware of any commercially\navailable stoichiometric uranium oxide standard\nand it appears that many chemical companies\nhave stopped stocking these compounds. Three\nuranium oxide compounds were purchased from\nIBI Labs (Boca Raton, Florida, USA): UO2, U3O8\nand g-UO3.\nXRD revealed that none of these powders were\npure. The U3O8 was mixed with UO3\u00022H2O\n(metaschoepite), UO3\u00020.8H2O (dehydrated schoe-\npite) and Ag2S (acanthite), but we were able to\npick black U3O8 grains from this material.\nContamination of UO2 by UO3\u00020.8H2O (dehy-\ndrated schoepite) was insignificant. The g-UO3 was\nmixed with a significant quantity of another U6+\ncompound, UO3\u00020.8H2O. Further information on\nthe XRD analyses can be found in Appendix 1.5.\nThe compounds were ground in an agate pestle and\nmortar; approximately 20 mg U equivalent were\nmixed with boron nitride (BN) powder and\ncompressed into 8 mm diameter pellets.\nExperimental\nXAS was performed at the microfocus spectro-\nscopy beamline I18 of The Diamond Light Source\n(Harwell, UK), a third generation electron\nsynchrotron (3 GeV, 250 mA), described in\nMosselmans et al. (2008). The X-ray beam\ndiameter at the sample position measured 3.5 mm.\nThe experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1.\nStandards were measured in transmission mode\nand the samples by fluorescence (measured\nperpendicular to the excitation beam). Similar\ninformation can be derived from the two analysis\nmodes. The standards were measured once each,\ntwice for U3O8 (with similar results). The spectra\nare supported by theoretical modelling. For each\nsample particle, three or four separate spot analyses\nwere measured in duplicate using the same beam\nposition for each duplicate measurement. No\ndifference was apparent between duplicate\nspectra that could be attributed to oxidation.\nX-ray absorption spectra were collected using a\nSi(111) double crystal monochromator scanned\nover the range 17.00\u000117.35 keV, crossing the\nU-LIII absorption edge in 0.5 eV steps, counting\neach step for 1 s, increasing to 2 eV steps and 4 s\nfor higher energies. In the analyses of the spectra,\nthe edge positions were calculated as the point of\ninflection (peak of first derivative of m(E), after\nlow-pass Fourier transform filter).\nMicrofocus extended X-ray absorption fine\nstructure (mEXAFS), w(k) spectra were isolated\nusing PySpline (Tenderholt et al., 2007), by least\nsquares fitting of quadratic splines and optimization\nof the Fourier transform (radial function). Extended\nX-ray absorption fine structure modelling from\nMORPHOLOGIES AND COMPOSITIONS OF DU PARTICLES\n499\ncrystallographic data was performed using\nDL_EXCURV (Tomic et al., 2005), achieving\nreasonable fits to the standard spectra (to k =\n9.5 A\u02da\u00011) from 3 scattering shells (2 for UO3),\nincluding multiple scattering paths (see Fig. 2).\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDXA)\nTwo SEMs were used to investigate raw dust\nsamples, dense concentrates from dusts and soils\nand picked uranium oxide spheres: (1) a Hitachi\nS-3600N \u2018environmental\u2019 SEM fitted with an\nOxford Instruments Inca X-sight; and (2) an FEI\nSirion 200 field emission SEM fitted with a\nPrinceton Gamma Tech. \u2018Spirit\u2019 X-ray analyser.\nEnergy dispersive X-ray spectrometers cannot\nquantify oxygen and it was therefore not possible\nto distinguish the different uranium oxides phases.\nThe environmental SEM, operating at P = 20 Pa,\nallowed uncoated specimens to be imaged using\nbackscattered electron (BSE) detectors; this mode\nfacilitates detection of heavy elements such as U.\nCarbon coating and high vacuum were used for\nsecondary electron (SE) imaging. Accelerating\nFIG. 1. Diagram of the experimental set-up for XAS, standards were measured in transmission mode, samples by\nfluorescence. SEM image of particle array (right).\nFIG. 2. EXAFS spectra from standards: experimental data points (dots) and theoretical models (lines). The models\nachieve reasonable fits from 3 scattering shells (2 for UO3) and are based on crystallographic data from ICSD\n(Fletcher et al., 1996). The second dominant oscillations, peaking in the region k = 3\u00014 A\u02da\u00011, are distinct for each\nstandard. For UO2, contributions from the first oxygen and uranium scattering shells create a distinctive asymmetric\nsecond peak in this region. It should be noted that the amplitude of EXAFS in measured absorption spectra decreases\nwith k value. Therefore, they are amplified by k2, but noise becomes an inherent issue at higher k values.\n500\nN. S. LLOYD ET AL.\nvoltages of 15\u000130 kV were used; lower accel-\nerating voltages improve spatial resolution, but\nhigher accelerating voltage improves X-ray\ndetection.\nResults\nSEM-EDXA\nComposition\nThe majority of the EDXA spectra from the\nuraniferous particles analysed were dominated by\nthe U-Ma peak (3.17 keV), an O-K peak and also\na C-K peak generated from the mounting\nsubstrates. This was almost exclusively true of\n\u2018clean\u2019 areas from uraniferous spheres.\nAluminium and Si peaks were commonly\nassociated with surface-adhering clays, appearing\nas dark cloudy regions in BSE mode and\ntranslucent platy regions in SE mode. Other\ncommon elements, frequently identified as\nsurface contamination, included Mg, Fe, Na,\nMn, Ca, K, Cl, S, and less commonly Cu and P.\nPeaks from Ti were, on occasions, also identified;\nhowever, the Ti concentration in the DU alloy, at\n~0.75 wt.%, is close to the limit of detection for\nthis method. Molybdenum and Nb were not\ndetected, although these elements were used in\nsome DU alloys instead of Ti in an attempt to\nimprove mechanical properties and corrosion\nresistance (Hopson et al., 1973).\nSize\nUraniferous particles from raw samples were\nidentified with geometric diameters in the range\n0.5\u0001150 mm (approximate unimodal log-normal\nparticle size distribution, coarse particle size-\nrange; see Appendix 2.8 for histogram). The\nthreshold for respirable particulate matter (PM2.5,\nparticulate matter less than 2.5 mm aerodynamic\nequivalent diameter) is 0.8 mm for UO2 (D =\n10.96 g cm\u00013). Particle size distributions were not\naccurately determined, because location by SEM\nbecomes increasingly difficult for smaller parti-\nculates. Particles of interest are scarce in raw\nsamples and concentrates are inherently biased\nbecause fine particulates <~20 mm diameter do\nnot settle readily in dense liquids. Importantly, it\nwas noted that the particles are often brittle and\neasily broken into smaller fragments, some of\nwhich would then be inhalable.\nMorphology\nFigure 3 presents a selection of 18 SEM\nmicrographs of uraniferous particles identified\nfrom environmental dust and soil samples; their\nmorphologies are described in the following text.\nAdditional micrographs, including all of the\nidentified uraniferous spheres, with the cross-\nsections of those analysed by XAS, are presented\nin Appendix 2.\nFigure 3a shows a well preserved uranium\noxide sphere from a dust sample; the surface is\nsplit and there is some evidence of minor pitting\non the surface (Fig. 3b). Based on their geometry,\nwe interpret the cavities in the surface of spheres\nFig. 3c,d (both from soil samples) as possible\nevidence of corrosion pitting. Corrosion pitting is\na process to which uranium oxides, for reasons\npreviously discussed, are likely to be susceptible\nin the environment. We also considered the\netching of alpha recoil damage from 238U decay\nand although the distribution of these cavities is\ncompatible with this idea, UO2 recovers from this\ntype of damage (Matzke, 1999). The amount of\ncorrosion from these and other spheres appears\nminor (a few percent).\nSome of the spheres have tails, consistent with\nmid-air solidification from a melt. Many are\nhollow (Fig. 3f,g), or include cavities (see\nAppendix 2.3), the formation of which is\ndiscussed in the following sub-section. The\ninterior of the cavity shown in Fig. 3g contains\nsquare tabular crystals, but the spheres more\ntypically comprise 1\u00012 mm diameter equiaxial\ncrystals as in Fig. 3d, but sometimes as coarse as\n12 mm in diameter as is shown in Fig. 3h. Some\nof the cross-sections reveal coarser crystals\ntowards their centres (see Appendix 2.3).\nPatrick and Cornette (1978) observed inter-\nconnecting concave plates across the surface of\nuranium oxide spheres from DU munitions\nimpacting armoured targets and interpreted their\nformation as melt-freezing from multiple sites\nacross their surface. Similar platy surfaces are\nseen in Fig. 3h,i. The sutured platy texture in\nFig. 3h is strikingly similar to that presented in\nfig. 7b of Krupka et al. (2009), but the size of\nparticle in Fig. 3h is >5 times larger.\nSome of the non-spherical particles are\ncomprised of agglomerated 1\u00012 mm diameter\nuraniferous grains. Triple junctions between\nthese are shown in Fig. 3j. This texture could\nhave been created by compression of aggregates\nin the furnace grate, under the weight of other\nmaterial. Alternatively, the texture may have been\nformed by powder metallurgy type processes at\nNLI, but it is distinct from sintered UO2 fuel (e.g.\nin Kashparov et al., 2004). Non-compacted\nMORPHOLOGIES AND COMPOSITIONS OF DU PARTICLES\n501\nFIG. 3. SEM images of uraniferous particles from dust and soil samples, showing a range of primary morphologies\nand textures, which are discussed in the text. Images from soils samples are as follows: c, d, k, n, q and r.\n502\nN. S. LLOYD ET AL.\naggregates of mm-scale diameter particulates are\nalso seen (Appendix 2.5), similar to those from\nChernobyl emissions (Salbu et al., 1994). Fluffy\naggregates of fine particulates are reasonably\ncommon in the samples (Fig. 3k and Appendix\n2.5), and may have been produced by vapour\ncondensation, nucleation and coagulation of\nparticulates in the NLI furnace.\nMorphologies that resemble metal shavings\nhave been observed. Fig. 3l shows a small\nuraniferous rod that has fractured during sample\npreparation. This brittle behaviour suggests that it\nis oxidized throughout. The foliated texture\ndisplayed in Fig. 3m is typical of the combustion\nof DU metal ammunition between 973\u00011173 K\n(Elder and Tinkle, 1980).\nIn addition to spheres, the appendices in\nParkhurst et al. (2004) include SEM micrographs\nof aggregates and some bladed crystal textures\nsimilar to Fig. 3n (specifically fig. D.2, or fig. 4 in\nKrupka et al., 2009). A mixed morphology, partly\nordered and polycrystalline, partly a disordered\naggregate, similar to Fig. 3o, is also presented\nthere (also in fig. 6, Krupka et al., 2009).\nThe block of uranium oxide in image Fig. 3p\nshows multiple fractures, similar to expansion\ntextures resulting from the oxidation of UO2 to\nU3O8 (McEachern and Taylor, 1998), which\ncould have occurred in the furnace environment.\nOnly one such example was identified.\nAn unusual texture of DU oxide (+Ti) on an\nAl\/alumina \u2018honeycomb\u2019 mesh (SNa) in image\nFig. 3q, may have been formed by the partial\ndissolution (in a wet soil environment) of a U-Al\nliquid phase sintered product, or possibly U\nprecipitation on a refractory material .\nAlternatively, it is similar to catalysts patented\nby Mabilon et al. (1991) but on a microscopic\nscale, which may have been an experimental\nproduct of NLI. Figure 3r shows a sphere that\ncomprises ~60% uranium oxide crystals\n(0.3\u00013 mm diameter) in an Fe or Fe-oxide\nmatrix.\nMore than 100 uranium oxide spheres were\nidentified in the 20\u000164 mm geometric diameter\nrange (median 37 mm, approximate unimodal\nnormal particle size distribution, see Appendix\n2.8 for histogram). The concentration techniques\nemployed limit this size range, especially for the\nlower end. These spheres are typically poly-\ncrystalline with equiaxial grains, ~1 mm diameter\n(estimated size range 0.3\u000112 mm).\nOf those sectioned (n = 45), 42% were hollow\nand another 42% included cavities; only 16%\nappeared solid. Of those sectioned, 60%, appeared\nto comprise U and O only. Minor EDXA peaks\nfrom Ti were detected in 27% of the remainder,\nAl in 20% and other elements in only 9% (LoD\n~1 wt.%). Analysis of the cleaned cross-sections\navoided the surface contaminants seen on the\nwhole particles.\nFormation of uranium oxide spheres\nSpherical particles were deliberately picked for\nthe XAS analyses, because they can be recognized\nunder an optical microscope. This distinctive\nmorphology is observed from the debris of DU\nmunitions impacting with armoured targets\n(dominant morphology, Patrick and Cornette,\n1978; common morphology, Parkhurst et al.,\n2004; Krupka et al., 2009) and less commonly\nin contaminated dusts and soils from the Colonie\ncase-study. The coarse size of these spheres\ndistinguishes them from the 1\u00012 mm diameter\nspherical uraniferous particles formed by the\noxidation and hydrolysis of UF6 escaping from\nenrichment plants, which are the focus of nuclear\nforensic analyses (Stebelkov, 2005; Kips et al.,\n2007).\nA number of experimental studies have\nproduced similar spheres. Jones et al. (1964)\nproduced UO2 microspheres by passing metal-\noxide through an inductively coupled plasma\ntorch (stoichiometric UO2 microspheres <50 mm\ndiameter were red in colour, some of the spheres\nwere hollow). Surya Narayana et al. (1994)\nelectrically heated UO2 pellets to a peak temp-\nerature of 3773 K, producing aggregates of fine\nU3O8 particulates (attributed to vapour condensa-\ntion) as well as larger low-solubility UO2 spheres\n(~4 mm diameter). Carter and Stewart (1970)\nproduced Pu and U spheres in the 0.1\u00011 mm\nrange, using exploding metal wire and freefall\ndroplets (melted and ignited at 933 K). They\ndisplayed a range of colours (white, yellow,\norange, brown, black) and textures (reticulation,\ndimpling, striations, glassy). Sparks from shat-\ntering freefall droplets produced spheres, often\nhollow. This was interpreted as rapid volatiliza-\ntion and emission of U from combusting molten\nmetal\/oxide droplets.\nMartz and Hashke (1998) present a conceptual\nmodel (supported by theoretical modelling and\nexperimental data) for the combustive heating of\nPu droplets. Following melting and ignition, this\nproceeds by autothermic oxidation and achieves\nvery high internal temperatures sufficient to\nMORPHOLOGIES AND COMPOSITIONS OF DU PARTICLES\n503\nvolatilize and vent Pu, leaving fragmented and\nhollow PuO2 shells. Uranium is also a pyrophoric\nmaterial and UO2 has a similar heat of formation\nas PuO2 and might be expected to behave in a\nsimilar way.\nPeak burning temperatures for small chunks of\nU metal in air reach 1773 K (Baker Jr et al.,\n1966), exceeding the U melting point of 1405 K\n(Katz and Seaborg, 1957). We propose that the\nobserved hollow uranium oxide spheres were\nformed by the ejection of small liquid-metal\ndroplets, the temperatures of which were much\nhigher than the U ignition temperature of\n563\u0001973 K (Baker Jr et al., 1966). Autothermic\noxidation raised their internal temperature, suffi-\ncient in many instances to volatilize and vent the\ncontents (4091 K for U metal, Katz and Seaborg,\n1957; 3815 K for uranium dioxide, INSC, 2008).\nThis process would be observed as bright sparks\nspitting from the furnace and sometimes\nexploding. Presumably, the vapour condensed\nand nucleated to form ultrafine particulates and\nagglomerates. The stability of U3O8 was exceeded\n(1878 K, Taylor, 2005); if cooled quickly, UO2+x\nis the expected phase (freezing at ~3120 K, INSC,\n2008), but if held at intermediate temperatures\nthis may oxidize further.\nPowder metallurgy is a processing technology,\ncommonly used to produce complex shaped metal\narticles directly, by compressing and sintering\nmetal powders (German, 1994). The extreme\nreactivity of U metal may appear to make this\nunattractive. However, U metal powders have\nbeen processed by reduction of oxides and\nhydride-dehydride conversion (Bellamy and\nBuddery, 1952; Clark et al., 1998). A contem-\nporary account of U metallurgy is given in\nMeerson (1960).\nA few of the particles identified are comprised\nof mm diameter uranium oxide grains with triple-\njunctions, a texture consistent with compressed,\nbut not fully sintered powders (Fig. 3j). The\ntexture in Fig. 3q could be explained as dissolu-\ntion of crystalline uranium oxides from a liquid-\nphase sintered powder, exposing a second\nalumina phase.\nThere is some evidence that U powder\nmetallurgy, which can produce uranium oxide\nspheres, may have been employed at NLI.\nHowever, the observed cavities and the size\nrange of the spheres are not consistent with the\npowder metallurgy techniques typically used for\nU. There is strong evidence that the spheres were\nproduced by oxidation of melt droplets.\nSummary of SEM work\nElectron microscopy reveals a range of morphol-\nogies and textures. Many of the uraniferous\nparticles are polycrystalline and some are\nspherical. The uranium oxide spheres are\nattributed to a specific process, i.e. the auto-\nthermic oxidation of melt droplets. Similar\nspheres are formed by DU munitions impacting\narmoured targets. All of the particles presented in\nFig. 3 and most of those identified by this study\nhave primary morphologies, attributed to specific\nprocesses at NLI. Some of the particles show\nevidence of minor dissolution, including a few\nwith evidence of corrosion pitting, a process that\nenhances oxidation and dissolution. Readily\nidentifiable evidence of secondary particles,\nprecipitates of U, in these samples (e.g.\nschoepite\/metaschoepite in Appendix 2.5) is\nscarce.\nIn summary, electron microscopy reveals that\ndust and soil samples from Colonie are contami-\nnated by primary uranium oxide particulates and\nthat these have survived more than 25 y of\nexposure in the terrestrial environment.\nmXAS\nmXANES\nmXANES for the standards showed the\nexpected increase in edge position (point of\ninflection) for higher oxidation states, presented\nin Appendix 1.4. However, the estimates for the\nsamples were typically less than the UO2 standard\nand do not appear reliable.\nmEXAFS\nmEXAFS spectra were isolated for each point\nanalysis, where possible from the average of\nreplicate absorption profiles. To correct for the\nvariable edge estimates used, the mEXAFS\nspectra were re-aligned for the first peak to the\nUO2 standard (k = 1.39), via energy space, m(E).\nThe mEXAFS are presented as k-squared\nweighted chi against k, w.k2(k), in Figs 2 and 4\n(and Appendix 1.2). Theoretical modelling of the\nstandard spectra produced reasonable fits for 2 or\n3 scattering shells, including multiple scattering\npaths (Fig. 2).\nThis study focuses on the second dominant\noscillation, because the first oscillation includes\nthe \u2018white-line\u2019 and is overly sensitive to spline\nfitting, and the data are noisy for the third and\nsubsequent oscillations. For UO2, the second\n504\nN. S. LLOYD ET AL.\ndominant oscillation has a pronounced asym-\nmetric shape and can be approximated by the\ncontributions from the first O and U shells. In\ncontrast, the second oscillation for U3O8 is\napproximately symmetrical and slightly extended\n(from a closer O shell). The \u2018UO3\u2019 spectrum is\ncharacterized by a distinctive \u2018shoulder\u2019 on the\nfirst peak, similar to that modelled by multiple\nscattering along a uranyl group (Hudson et al.,\n1995). We applied linear combination least-\nsquares fitting, using the three standard spectra,\nto each of the sample spectra, in the region k =\n2\u00015 A\u02da\u00011, which covers these characteristic\nfeatures.\nThree selected sample spectra are compared\nwith the standards in Fig. 4, the complete set of\n42 sample spectra can be found in Appendix 1.\nThe compositions from the spot analyses are\npresented in Fig. 5.\nBy using a microfocus beamline, it was\npossible to analyse different parts of individual\nparticles, but no clear differences in composition\nbetween rim and core were observed. With a\n3.5 mm beam, it was not expected to detect thin\nsurface films of higher oxides. The spatial\nresolution of the spot analyses averages across\nseveral crystals and grain boundaries within the\npolycrystalline particles. Due to the sample\ngeometry in our experiments, it would not be\npossible to create a symmetrical cross-sectional\nprofile or map from individual particles, as the\nleading edge is shielded by the body of the\nparticle. Furthermore, when the edge of the\nparticle is approached, absorption is minimized\nand the spectra become increasingly noisy.\nPhysical rotation of the particle, particle\nsectioning and longer counting times for edge\nanalyses would be required to overcome these\nissues.\nDiscussion\nOsa\u00b4n et al. (1997) utilized a least squares fitting\napproach for the XANES (for As, to 40 eV above\nFIG. 4. mEXAFS spectra for 3 standards and 3 selected sample spectra from the dust sample. Least-squares fitting of\nthe standards to the sample spectra achieved good adjusted-R2 values (>0.75, adjusted for degrees of freedom).\nFitting parameter uncertainties ~S 10% for these spectra.\nMORPHOLOGIES AND COMPOSITIONS OF DU PARTICLES\n505\nthe K-edge), fitting white-line, \u2018multiple-scat-\ntering\u2019 and edge curves to the spectra. They\nargued that since the white-line overlaps the true\nabsorption edge, it is not sufficient to study this\nalone. To\u00a8ro\u00a8k et al. (2004) argued that this method\nis superior to the inflection points measured by\nSalbu et al. (2003).\nThe edge positions for our data did not prove to\nbe reliable indicators of composition. Whether\nthis is due to instrumental drift or some other\nfactor is uncertain. Typical EXAFS analyses span\nseveral oscillations to higher k values and utilize\nthe radial function to resolve contributions from\nindividual scattering shells. The amplitude of\nEXAFS oscillations diminishes towards higher k\nvalues; noise therefore becomes an inherent issue.\nThis is especially true for microfocus spectro-\nscopy, which excites a small sample volume with\na reduced X-ray intensity. Long counting times\nwould be required to improve spectra quality, but\nthis would limit the number of samples analysed,\nfurther compromising representativity. Therefore,\nsample spectra were only acquired to 7 A\u02da\u00011.\nThis study employed an alternative strategy,\nleast-squares fitting for a limited portion of\nthe mEXAFS spectra, including the second\noscillation and the uranyl shoulder of the UO3\nstandard, in the region k = 2\u00015 A\u02da\u00011. Adjusted R2\nvalues of ~0.9 and examination of the residuals,\nsuggest that the fits are generally good. The\nuncertainty of the fitting parameters is typically in\nthe range of S 5\u000115%, precluding detailed\ncomparisons between individual spot analyses.\nOn a generalized and qualitative basis, the spot\nanalyses are consistent across individual spheres.\nUO2 and U3O8 oxides are the most commonly\nreported combustive products of DU munitions in\nenvironmental samples (Table 1) and the\ncommon phases identified for these samples.\nThis study found a dominance of UO2, with\nvariable amounts of U3O8. The model of\nautothermic oxidation and venting from melt\ndroplets predicts core temperatures that exceed\nthe stability of U3O8, freezing as UO2, which may\nthen (slowly) re-oxidize to U3O8 at intermediate\ntemperatures. These data are compatible with this\nmodel.\nIt should be noted that these mEXAFS spectra\nand the cited XAS studies, do not resolve\nstoichiometric UO2 from the more than likely\nhyperstoichiometric uranium oxides and it would\nbe preferable to state UO2+x. Allen et al. (1985)\nand Jones et al. (1986) demonstrated the subtle\ndifferences in the EXAFS spectra of the cubic\nuranium oxides (UO2, U4O9 and b-U3O7);\nresolving these species from each other for\nenvironmental particles is probably beyond the\nscope of mXAS.\nUranyl species, represented by the UO3\nstandard, appear to be rare in these spheres. In\ncontrast, uraniferous particles analysed in a core\nsample from a reservoir sediment (wet environ-\nment), appear to include metaschoepite (Arnason\net al., 2008). These reservoir sediments accumu-\nlated U compared to nearby soils and it appears\nlikely that any uranyl species precipitated from\nwatershed runoff, which includes effluent\ndischarged from the NLI site.\nParticulates from DU munitions impacting\narmour, sampled directly from aerosol and\nincluding morphologically similar spheres, are\npredominantly U3O8 and U4O9 in composition\nwith no UO2 detected by XRD (Parkhurst et al.,\n2004; Krupka et al., 2009). However, in XRD,\nthere are spectral overlaps between U3O8 and UO3\nand also between U4O9 and UO2, limiting the\ndetection of minor UO3 and UO2 (Krupka et al.,\n2009). Mitchell and Sunder (2004) identified U3O7\nas a common phase from DU munitions impacting\narmoured targets, along with U3O8 and minor\nFIG. 5. Ternary diagram of the estimated compositions of\nmicroscopic uranium oxide spheres from mEXAFS spot\nanalyses. The compositions are dominated by UO2, with\nvariable amounts of U3O8. Fitting parameter uncertain-\nties are typically S5\u000115% of total. UO3 is only\nsignificant (2s) for 3 spectra. Minor components, less\nthan 10%, should be treated with caution. Spectra from 7\nsoil grains and 7 dust grains show a similar distribution\nof compositions. The fitting data are tabulated in\nAppendix 1.3.\n506\nN. S. LLOYD ET AL.\nUO2+x. As discussed previously, the cubic\nuranium oxide phases are also difficult to resolve\nfor environmental particle samples using mXAS.\nA discussion of alternative analytical techniques\nfor U speciation is beyond the scope of this paper,\nbut XPS (e.g. Schueneman et al., 2003) and m-\nRaman spectroscopy (e.g. Allen et al., 1987) could\nbe considered for future studies of this material.\nThe apparent differences in compositions for\nthe DU munitions aerosol may be due to the\nselection of a specific morphology and size-range\nfor this study and the inclusion of others in the\nbulk aerosol samples. The UO2 rich particles are\nalso more likely to survive environmental\nexposure intact, to the point of selective picking\nfor analysis.\nThis study, as with those of To\u00a8ro\u00a8k et al. (2004)\nand Salbu et al. (2003), analysed a limited number\nof particles, which may not be fully representative\nof the environmental samples. We also acknowl-\nedge that these particles were selected by\nmorphology from a specific size-range. It is\ntherefore not necessarily appropriate to extra-\npolate these findings to respirable particulates.\nHowever, the continued excretion of anthropo-\ngenic isotope ratios by workers and some\nresidents, more than 20 y after exposure (Parrish\net al., 2008), suggests that the inhaled particulates\nwere also low-solubility phases (e.g. UO2 and\/or\nU3O8).\nConclusions\nThis initial study of the Colonie particles shows\nthat mixed UO2+x and U3O8 micro-spheres\nsurvive in the terrestrial environment (soils and\ndusts) for at least 25 y. The U from these low-\nsolubility phases, dominated by U4+, is less\nbioaccessible and less mobile than uranyl\nspecies (e.g. UO3). Higher solubility, uranyl\nspecies (U6+) are a rare and minor component of\nthe analysed particles.\nA range of primary particle morphologies, as\nemitted from NLI, have been identified and\nsurvive to the present time. The morphologies of\nthe contaminant uraniferous particles include\nmicroscopic uranium oxide spheres that are\nsimilar to those produced from DU munitions\nimpacting armoured targets. This further supports\nthe case for using Colonie as a realistic analogue\nfor ba t t lefie ld con tamina t ion by DU.\nMorphological investigation and compositional\nanalyses of uraniferous fine particulates in these\nsamples are recommended for further work.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was sponsored by the British\nGeological Survey (NERC) and the NERC\nIsotope Geosciences Laboratory (NIGL).
