Introduction  \n \nToday, livestock production systems have multiple objectives imposed on them. As \nwell as profit, they must maintain standards of animal welfare and reduce environmental \nimpact (Frost et al., 1997). They have become complex interconnected processes: \ngrowth, health, welfare, and environmental emissions all depend on the animal's supply \nof nutrients. Managing growth by controlling nutrition will therefore affect these other \nfactors. \n \nLivestock management decisions are based almost entirely on the judgement and \nexperience of the stockman, who must estimate or guess the likely effects of any control \naction, with each of the individual processed involved controlled separately. The farm \nmanager will usually apply a prescriptive nutritional regime designed in the expectation \nthat it will produce the required result. In a well-managed enterprise, the nutritional \nregime will be based on a growth model. \n \nAn integrated management system (IMS) is the combination of livestock models, \nmonitoring equipment and feed control systems into an automatic system where control \nof these subsystems is delegated to an automatic controller (Frost et al., 1997, \nWhittemore et al., 2001d). This allows closed-loop control decisions to be made in real \ntime as and when data are collected. The improved economic efficiency and \nenvironmental gains offered by the IMS approach are becoming increasingly apparent \nto industry leaders. Integrated management systems can be used to improve welfare, by \nenhancing the ability to provide an ideal diet at all times, will allow better control of \ngrowth to obtain uniformity in the desired composition and quality, and by not \nproviding nutrients to excess, reduce environmental pollution (e.g. nitrogen). This will \nreduce the time that farm staff must spend on decision making about feed provision, \nenabling them to concentrate on important issues such as health and welfare. \n \n  3  \nIntegrated management systems have already been developed for poultry (Frost et \nal., 2003; Stacey et al., 2004; Aerts et al., 2003a; Aerts et al., 2003b). This paper \ndescribes the development of the first prototype closed-loop, model-based, real-time \nsystem for the integrated control of pig growth and pollutant emissions. It demonstrates \nthe performance of a novel growth controller to achieve set growth rate and fat \ndeposition targets. \n \n2.  Materials and methods \n \n2.1. Experimental facilities and data collection \n \nExperiments were carried out at ADAS Terrington, Norfolk, England. Two sets of \ntrials, each with 144 pigs of a commercial breed (JSR white 12 boar-line) were \nperformed in controlled environment facilities in six rooms each containing two pens \ncapable of holding 12 pigs up to 100 kg. The temperature was maintained at \napproximately 19 C (which was adjusted if the pigs showed adverse behavioural \nresponses) and lighting was on a 12\/12 hour light\/dark cycle. \n \nTrial 1 contained equal numbers of male and female pigs; trial 2 contained males \nonly. In each trial, half of the pigs were delivered at a nominal weight of 30 kg, the \nremainder at 50 kg; pigs of different weights were allocated to different rooms. There \nwas considerable variation about the nominal weights, especially in trial 2: the range for \nthe 30 kg pigs was 28\u201340 kg, and for the 50 kg pigs, 39\u201357 kg. Tables 1 and 2 show the \nallocation of pens and trial targets or treatments. The targets and treatments are \ndescribed in more detail in section 2.5. \n \nEach pen contained a feeder, which measured the weight of feed delivered to each \npig at each visit, identified by radio frequency transponders embedded in the pigs\u2019 ear \ntags. The pigs were fed ad libitum diets that varied in crude protein (CP) content \nbetween pens, produced by manually blending two source diets with CP contents of 140 \nand 190 g\/kg  [dry matter]. At any time, all the pigs in a pen received the same diet. \n  4  \nWater was available ad libitum via nipple drinkers, and the total water use per pen was \nrecorded weekly. \n \nThe pens had slatted floors and the slurry from each pen was collected in a separate \npit. The total volume collected in each trial was recorded, and the slurry was sampled \nand analysed for total (Kjeldahl) nitrogen  concentration. The ventilation rate for each \nroom was logged at 1 minute intervals. The ammonia losses were measured continually \nusing the acid trap technique (0.02 M orthophosphoric acid solution); the acid traps \nwere changed twice weekly. It was thus possible to calculate the total mass of nitrogen \nemitted by the pigs in each pen and the combined weekly emissions of ammonia for \neach room. \n \nA camera was mounted above each feeder, supplying images to a visual image \nanalysis (VIA) system. This system measures areas and linear dimensions and estimates \nvolumes quickly, frequently, and accurately, giving objective assessment of the size, \nshape, and hence growth of individual pigs. It has been shown to estimate the weights of \nindividual growing pigs with average errors under 3.5% (Marchant et al., 1999; \nSchofield et al., 1999, 2002; White et al., 2004). The measured dimensions also enable \nassessment of lean meat and fatness (Doeschl et al., 2004; Doeschl-Wilson et al., 2005). \nThe software was a version of Vista (Osborne (Europe) Ltd., North Shields, England) \nadapted to use the same identification transponders as the feeder and provide the data \nneeded for the model and control program. It recorded the daily median values for \nweight and 12 physical dimensions for each pig in the herd. \n \nPigs were also weighed manually weekly, and backfat depth measurements were \ntaken at the P2 position (65 mm from the midline at the last rib) using an ultrasound \nscanner fitted with a 3.5 MHz veterinary external probe (Concept MLV, Dynamic \nImaging Ltd., Livingston, Scotland). Initial collation and processing of the collected \ndata was carried out automatically by the computer on-farm. The processed data was \nthen transferred to Silsoe Research Institute at least once a week for further processing. \n \n  5  \nIn the initial stages of trial 1, faults in the feed delivery and monitoring equipment \nmeant that there were periods for which the data were unreliable until repairs could be \nmade. The worst affected pens were 1 and 5, but several others had shorter \ninterruptions. These were resolved, so there were few problems in trial 2. \n \n2.2. Growth model \n \nThe system was based on a mechanistic model of pig growth, as described by Green \nand Whittemore (2003, 2005), using algorithms described by Whittemore et al. (2001a, \n2001b, 2001c). This model predicts the growth of an individual pig through change in \ncomposition given a description of the current status, growth potential, feed intake, and \nenvironment of the pig. \n \nThe pigs were allowed to become acclimatised to the feeding system for five days, \nduring which both the intake and VIA data were discarded. Following this period, the \nmedian of the VIA-derived weights for the next three days was taken as the initial value \nfor the model. Using the median guarded against occasional false readings. The initial \nfatness (lipid weight\/body weight) of the pigs F0 was unknown, so it was set according \nto the initial weight W0 (kg) based on typical values observed in trials conducted during \nthe development of the system: \n \n \n355.924\/ - 0.269\n351.0\n00\n0\n0 { >\u2264= WW WF   (1) \n \nOnce initialised, the model was run using the recorded feed intakes for individuals \nand the blends supplied to pens as inputs, after filtering the data to remove occasional \nerrors in the recording system. The mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) compared \nwith the VIA estimated weight was calculated for each pig and the sum of these was \nused as a measure of how well the model fitted the data for a given pen. \n \nIn general, the unfitted model performed well (see the results below), but tended to \nunderpredict the growth rate slightly. The agreement varied between pigs and between \n  6  \npens, due to slight variations in genotype, environment, health status and behaviour. \nThis was expected and the system included a mechanism to adjust the model parameters \nin response to observations. \n \n2.3. Model adaptation mechanism \n \nThe system was designed to allow selected model parameters to be optimised within \ndefined ranges to minimise the MSEP. The optimisation used the nonlinear revised \nsimplex method of Nelder and Mead (1965) in a modified form that allowed constraints \nto be imposed (see Appendix 1). Experiments were conducted with other data sets using \nsingle parameters or up to three optimised jointly; good adaptation, without biologically \nunrealistic values, was obtained by optimising two parameters simultaneously. One of \nthese, referred to as the \u2018illness factor\u2019 Fdisease (dimensionless), controlled the efficiency \nof use of dietary supplied nutrients (Green & Whittemore, 2005). This was allowed to \nvary over a range of 0.1\u20131.9 times its nominal value (3.0), where a low value represents \nhigh efficiency (good health). The other parameter B (d-1) controlled the maximum \nprotein retention rate (Green & Whittemore, 2005), and was better determined, so was \ngiven a range of 0.7\u20131.3 times its nominal value. \n  \n2.4. Controller \n \nWhen the system was required to make a control decision the model was first \nadapted for each individual in the pen using the data up to that time, as described in \nsection 2.3 above, in order to improve its prediction of future growth. The individual \nmodels were then used predictively to model growth up to the end of the trial. In order \nto do so, a forecast of feed intake was required for each pig. Modelling voluntary intake \nis difficult and unreliable, and may best be obtained by observation (Schinkel & de \nLange, 1996), so intake profiles were derived from results recorded in earlier trials \n(Green et al., 2003). In trial 1, it was assumed that the pigs would follow these profiles. \nIn trial 2, they were adjusted by the control system to account for variations between \npigs, as follows. The mean ratio between the actual intake and the intake profile for the \nprevious 14 days was calculated for each pig. It was then assumed that it would \n  7  \ncontinue to consume the same proportion of the intake profile for the next 14 days, then \nreturn to the profile over the next 14. This damped out daily fluctuations, while allowing \nsubstantial changes in intake to be accommodated, but remained conservative about \nlong-term intake patterns. \n \nThe controller then optimised the dietary blend, and hence the crude protein content, \nto minimise the MSEP from the target for the remaining period. As the blend could only \nbe controlled at the pen level, the objective function used was the sum of the MSEPs of \nall the pigs in the pen. There were separate sub-trials attempting to control weight and \nfat depth; joint control of both may be required in practice, so the objective function \nused a weighted sum of the errors in both variables. Furthermore, the objectives could \nbe set either as a trajectory, that is a value for each day, or as up to four discrete points. \nTrial 1 used trajectories and trial 2 set target values for the end of the trial (day 70) only. \n \nThere was a single control variable, the dietary blend, but this could in principle be \nvaried each day, giving up to 70 dimensions. This was reduced by having a control \nvariable trajectory, in the form of a piecewise linear function, whose slope changed at \ndiscrete, equally-spaced nodes. Tests showed that the MSEP between target and \nprediction reduced as the number of nodes was increased from one to four, but showed \ninsignificant improvement beyond four nodes. The optimisation problem was thus \nreduced to four dimensions. The slope was constrained to restrict the rate of change of \nthe protein content. If the slope took the blend for any day outside the range [0,1], it was \nsimply assumed to take the limiting value. A small penalty was added to the objective \nfunction when this happened, because it improved the efficiency of the optimisation by \nreducing the time spent exploring irrelevant regions of the control space. \n \nSeveral optimisation algorithms were tested, including genetic algorithms, quasi-\nNewton methods and the nonlinear revised simplex method. The genetic algorithms \nwere robust, that is, not prone to instability and consistent in finding the optimum, but \nthey were slow. The quasi-Newton methods were capable of high precision, which was \nnot required in practice, and became slow, or even unstable, in the presence of the full \nset of constraints. The constraints that represented simple bounds on the variables were \n  8  \neliminated by transforming the state space using a sine function to transform an \nunbounded variable to a bounded one, but this did not improve the performance \nsignificantly. The mean speed of the revised simplex method was greater than the other \nmethods, it remained stable, and the precision was acceptable, considering the precision \nthat could practically be achieved in blending the feeds. This combination of features \nmade it most the suitable method, and it was therefore used in all the trials. \n  \n2.5. Targets and treatments \n \nThe targets and treatments used in the two trials are shown in Tables 1 and 2. In \neach trial, the pigs in pens 1\u20134 were used for a sub-trial in which the targets were set as \nfinal P2 back fat depths. The pigs in pens 5\u20138 were used for a sub-trial with final weight \ntargets. However, due to the large variation in initial weight within each pen in trial 2, \nthe targets for this trial were set in terms of weight gain rather than target weight. The \ntargets weight gains were 5 kg higher than those for trial 1, because the health of the \npigs in the early stages of the trial was better, which enabled them to grow more \nquickly. \n \nNo targets were set for the pigs in pens 9\u201312. These were given fixed diets \nthroughout using the high (190 g\/kg) and low (140 g\/kg) protein feeds without blending \nin order to promote the development of contrasting body conformation as part of the \nanalysis of the visual imaging system results. These pigs, therefore, were not used in the \ncontroller trial, but were included in the model and adaptation testing. \n \n3.  Results and discussion \n \n3.1. Growth model and model adaptation \n \nIn assessing the system performance, it is the ability to predict and control the \nliveweight of the pigs that is most important, rather than the prediction by the model of \nthe VIA estimate of weight.  All of the trial results were therefore compared with the \nresults of manual weighings and P2 back fat assessments made shortly before slaughter.  \n  9  \nTables 3 and 4 summarise the ability of the model to predict the final weight and fat \ndepth for trials 1 and 2, respectively. The results are shown for the initial values of the \ntwo parameters used for adaptation and after optimising them at the end of the trial. \n \nIt can be seen that the overall agreement between the model and the observed final \nweights was slightly better in trial 2 than trial 1. In both trials, optimising the model \nparameters at the end of the run using the VIA weight estimates reduced the root mean \nsquared error of prediction (RMSEP) of the model compared with manual weights for \nthe herd by about half.  In each trial there were a few cases where the optimisation \nincreased the RMSEP slightly for a pen; generally when the agreement was already \ngood.  The largest increase was in trial 1 pen 5, which was due intermittent substantial \nVIA overestimates of the weights of some of the pigs, which caused the optimisation to \nincrease the prediction above the true weights, which were used in the calculation of the \nRMSEP.  Better filtering of these outlying values would remove the problem.  In \ngeneral, the error in the prediction of fat depth was slightly increased by optimisation. \nThis was not unexpected, because there was no feedback mechanism for fat depth, and \ntherefore no reason why the prediction should improve.  It should also be noted that the \nmeasurement of fat depth using ultrasound is itself prone to errors. \n \nIn addition to the incorrect VIA estimates noted above, it should be noted that some \nof the adaptation may have been to systematic errors in the feed intake data. In trial 2, \nthe total mass of feed supplied to each pen was compared with the mass recorded by the \nfeeding system. In 8 of the 12 pens, the feeding system record was within +\/- 11% of \nthe manual record. The worst cases were pen 1, in which the automatic system recorded \n122% of the total supplied, and pen 5, which recorded 83%. Pen 1 was the only one \nwhere the adaptation mechanism did not consistently reduce the illness factor for the \npigs (i.e. increase the efficiency), which would be consistent with achieving similar pig \nperformance to the other pens, but recording a higher level of feeding than was actually \nthe case. \n \nTo illustrate the results, it is useful to focus on a single pen and an individual pig. \nAn example of the results for one pig up to the end of the trial is shown in  Fig. 1 (trial 2 \n  10  \npen 1 pig 249). It shows a close agreement between the model, VIA estimated weight \nand manual weight, with a small deviation at the end. The MSEP for this pig compared \nwith the VIA weights over the whole run was 9 kg2; for the pen (12 pigs) the total was \n266 kg2, and the highest in the pen was 66 kg2. The predicted final weight for pig 249 \nwas 96.7 kg compared with a measured weight of 94 kg; an error of 2.7 kg, which is \nconsistent with the MSEP of 9 kg2.  The RMSEP of the model compared with the \nmeasured final weights, where the mean was taken over all the pigs in the pen, was 8.5 \nkg.  After optimising the model parameters to minimise the errors from the VIA \nestimated weights, the RMSEP for the pen compared with the measured final weights \nwas reduced to 2.5 kg. \n \nAs was the case for the whole herd, the prediction of back fat depth was generally \nless reliable. For pig 249, the measured depth was 10 mm and the predicted depth was \n12.4 mm.  The RMSEP for the pen was 1.9 mm.  The optimisation procedure, based \nonly on weight, increased the prediction for pig 249 to 12.9 mm and increased the \nRMSEP for the pen to 2.5 mm. \n \nThese results confirmed that the model gave generally good performance, and that \noptimising the chosen parameters using the VIA weight estimates could improve the \nprediction of weight.  However, they used optimisation at the end of the run.  In the \ntrials, the optimisations were performed at each decision point using the data available \nat that time.  A similar analysis to the above was performed by truncating the VIA \nrecord at day 39 and predicting the final weight based on actual intakes until the end of \nthe trial.  The results are shown in Tables 5 and 6.  The results again show that \noptimisation reduced the RMSEP of weight, although by a smaller amount, as would be \nexpected.  The effects on the prediction of fat depth are also slightly less than when \noptimisation is performed using the full data set.  These results confirm that the desired \neffect was obtained by this method of model adaptation. \n \n \n \n  11  \n3.2. Operation as an offline growth and nutrition control system \n \nTable 7 shows the final result of the pens used for the controlled growth sub-trial in \ntrial 1.  Both weight and fat depth show only limited control.  For both variables the \nlower target is exceeded and the higher one is not achieved.  The maximum growth rate \nof the pigs may have been restricted by the health problems noted above, and the \ndifficulties with the feed recording system, particularly in the earlier stages reduced the \nprecision of the control system. \n \nTable 8 shows the corresponding result for trial 2.  Other than pen 7, which will be \ndiscussed below, the mean weight gain was within 2.5 kg of the target in each pen, and \nthe back fat depth was within 1 mm of the lower target.  The higher target for the pigs in \npens 3 and 4 proved to be beyond the capability of the system given the range of \npossible diets and ad libitum feeding, but the pigs in these pens achieved greater back \nfat depth than those fed on the lower protein diet throughout. \n \nThe pigs in pen 7 grew at a rate very close to the target for about 8 weeks, then \nsuffered an interruption in their growth, for reasons that cannot be determined, as shown \nin Fig. 2.  Although they then started to recover, there was insufficient time for the \ncontroller to return them to the target.  Their mean deviation from the target on day 54 \nwas -2.3 kg. \n \n3.3. Other potential benefits \n \nIn the course of the trials, it became clear that the combination of continuous \nmonitoring of intake and the visual image of the pigs provided the potential for \nsophisticated problem detection. When a pig became lame, the change in posture often \nproduced a sudden change in the area (shape) recorded by the VIA system, well before \nany effect on weight was detectable. If the feed intake of a pig dropped this was often \nnot immediately obvious from the intake records, because intake was quite variable \nfrom day to day. The weight estimate from the VIA system usually required several \ndays before the decline in growth rate, or weight loss, was obvious. The weight gain \n  12  \npredicted by the model often responded more quickly because some of the time \nconstants in the model were shorter than in the metabolism of the animals. However, the \nmagnitude of the change was usually comparable. On the other hand, a reduction in \nweight gain, or actual weight loss estimated by the VIA system when the model \npredicted continued growth, showed that intake was unaffected, but conversion \nefficiency was dropping, probably as a result of disease or other problems, such as \nscouring. By adding software to monitor the intake, VIA records, model predictions and \npossibly the corrections made by the adaptation algorithm over several days, the \nherdsman could be automatically alerted to health and welfare problems. \n \nIt was suggested in the introduction that IMS could offer environmental benefits, \nparticularly by making more efficient use of protein in feeds to reduce nitrogen \nemissions. In the trials, the total nitrogen emitted in slurry (aggregated by pen) and \nammonia (aggregated by pair of pens) were recorded. The ammonia emissions were \nallocated to pens in the same ratio as the recorded slurry nitrogen; since the ammonia \ntypically accounted for about 3% of the nitrogen emitted, the errors this could introduce \nwere small. Using these data for trial 2, the mean emission of nitrogen from the pigs in \nthe controlled weight gain sub-trial (pens 5\u20138) was 35 g\/kg weight gained. Those in \npens 5, 6, and 8 emitted only 30\u201331 g\/kg, but those in pen 7, where growth problems \nwere observed in week 8, emitted 49 g\/kg. The mean emission from the pigs on fixed \nfeeding (pens 9\u201312) was 45 g\/kg and from those in the fat gain sub-trial (pens 1\u20134) 51 \ng\/kg. There were insufficient data to estimate the variances of the emission estimates, \nbut the tentative conclusion from these data is that successful controlled weight gain \ncould reduce nitrogen emissions substantially. Although the data were inadequate for \nproper validation, the trend in the prediction of nitrogen emissions by the model was \ncorrect within each trial. In theory, it would be possible to add a total nitrogen emission \nobjective or constraint to the control system, to reduce the environmental burdens \nproduced; the results obtained so far show that this merits further study. Controlling \nammonia emission would be more complex, because it depends on environmental and \nbehavioural factors. \n \n  13  \n5. Conclusions \n \nThe present study has shown that pig growth model optimisation can be performed \nin real time using visual image analysis (VIA) data, and that weight gain in pigs can be \ncontrolled through an integrated management system using ad libitum feeding and a \nrange of diet crude protein (CP) content.   \n \nThe results also indicate that some control of fat depth may also be possible, \nalthough the range of diets available to the trial meant that it was not possible to test this \nfully. Ideally, some form of feedback of fat content would be required, possibly by \nderiving a conformation measure from the VIA variables. \n \nSuccessful feeding for controlled weight gain appears to reduce the total emissions \nof nitrogen. In principle, the system could be extended to include this as an objective or \na constraint. \n \nIf VIA monitoring and intake recording were in operation, advanced detection of \nsome health and welfare problems would become possible with little additional cost. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was funded under the UK Defra LINK Sustainable Livestock Production \nProgramme.

British \nSociety of Animal Science, Edinburgh, pp 89\u201395. \n  17  \nAppendix 1. Constraining the revised simplex method \n \nSince its publication, the revised simplex method (RSM) (Nelder & Mead, 1965) \nhas proved popular in many nonlinear optimisation applications where function \nderivatives are not available, despite its poor performance in higher dimensions, for the \nsame reasons that it was used in this research: simplicity and robustness. The RSM was \nbased on the earlier simplex method of Spendley et al. (1962); the key difference being \nthat the RSM allowed the simplex to change shape to adapt to the topography of the \nsearch space. A limitation of both methods was the absence of an inbuilt method of \nhandling constraints. Box (1965) found that introducing constraints into the original \nsimplex method in the form of barrier functions often led to the simplex collapsing to a \nfalse optimum at a barrier. The method proposed by Box, the complex method, allowed \nthe number of points used to increase. However, this was in part a response to the \nlimitations already addressed by Nelder and Mead. More recently Subrahmanyam \n(1989) proposed another constrained version by introducing a new delayed reflection \noperation to prevent the simplex collapsing (the delayed reflection method, DRM). \nHowever, this was comparatively complex to implement, negating one of the attractions \nof the method. \n \nThe method used in this study was based on unpublished work by Parsons (1992) \nthat tested several simple methods of applying constraints to the RSM for a range of test \nproblems. The method chosen was referred to as the new maximum method (NMM). \nWhen a new point is generated for possible inclusion in the simplex, it is first tested for \nviolation of any of the constraints. If a constraint is violated (referred to as an infeasible \npoint), the new point is assigned a value mid way between the current maximum (i.e. \nthe worst point) and the next highest point in the simplex. This allows it to be included \nin the simplex, reducing the likelihood of it collapsing, but ensures that no more than \none point is infeasible at any time, subject to the constraint that all of the points in the \ninitial simplex were feasible. The only overhead is thus the need to keep track of one \npoint in addition to the maximum and minimum. \n \n  18  \nA modification of the RSM proposed by Parkinson and Hutchinson (1972) was also \nincluded. They noted that the RSM was inefficient where progress could be made by \ndescent in a single direction on a scale substantially larger than the simplex (visualise a \nlong downhill run), because this required several complete iterations, and could lead to \nelongation of the simplex. By introducing an operation that they called unlimited \nexpansion and translation they reduced multiple iterations in the same direction to one. \n \nThe NMM was tested against fixed penalty (barrier) methods and others that \nallowed more infeasible points to enter the simplex, using a set of test problems with a \nsets of constraints that placed the minimum in a \u2018corner\u2019 of the feasible region in 5 \ndimensions, or set very tight bounds  on one of the variables. The NMM gave the best \nperformance on these problems and was the only one that consistently gave the correct \nresult for the second type. It succeeded by adapting better to the geometry of the search \nspace. The inclusion of unlimited expansion and translation was beneficial where the \nconstraints forced a reduction in the scale of the simplex. \n \nThe NMM with unlimited expansion and translation was then compared with the \nresults published by Subrahmanyam for the DRM using four test problems with non-\nlinear constraints that were designed to be challenging. In two of these the NMM gave \nbetter results than the DRM, finding the optimum with equivalent or higher precision in \nmany fewer iterations. In the third, which included an equality constraint, the DRM \nrequired 10 times as many iterations as the NMM, but achieved higher precision. \nRestarting the NMM allowed it to achieve similar precision to the DRM, but with more \niterations. Whenever possible, equality constraints should be eliminated by \nreformulating the problem to reduce the dimension. In this case, it resulted in a problem \nwith linear constraints, for which the NMM performed well. The fourth problem used a \nseven dimensional objective function with four constraints in five variables each. The \nNMM achieved significantly lower precision than the DRM. \n \nIt was concluded that the NMM was the best of the methods tested, except for high \ndimensional problems with complex nonlinear constraints. It was therefore well suited \nto the application described in this paper. \n  19  \n \nTable 1 \nAllocation of pigs and targets to pens in trial 1 \n \nPen Sex Initial weight \n(nominal), kg \nTarget weight, \nkg \nTarget fat depth, \nmm \nTreatment \n(protein level) \n1 F 50  16  \n2 M 50  16  \n3 F 50  12  \n4 M 50  12  \n5 F 30 85   \n6 M 30 85   \n7 F 30 75   \n8 M 30 75   \n9 F 30   High (190 g\/kg) \n10 M 30   High (190 g\/kg) \n11 F 50   Low (140 g\/kg) \n12 M 50   Low (140 g\/kg) \n \nTable 2 \nAllocation of pigs and targets to pens in trial 2 \n \nPen Sex Initial weight \n(nominal), kg \nTarget weight \ngain, kg \nTarget fat depth, \nmm \nTreatment \n(protein level) \n1 M 50  12  \n2 M 50  12  \n3 M 50  16  \n4 M 50  16  \n5 M 30 50   \n6 M 30 50   \n7 M 30 60   \n8 M 30 60   \n9 M 30   Low (140 g\/kg) \n10 M 30   High (190 g\/kg) \n11 M 50   Low (140 g\/kg) \n12 M 50   High (190 g\/kg) \n \n \n  20  \nTable 3 \nResults of optimising the model at the end of run in trial 1 \nPen Final \nnumber \nof pigs \nRMSEP of \nweight before \noptimisation, kg \nRMSEP of \nweight after \noptimisation, kg \nRMSEP of fat \ndepth before \noptimisation, mm \nRMSEP of fat \ndepth after \noptimisation, mm\n1 9 3.81 5.82 3.20 3.28 \n2 10 21.43 9.01 3.37 4.02 \n3 6 9.91 7.11 2.81 3.61 \n4 7 16.98 8.79 3.65 4.35 \n5 12 5.40 6.55 2.35 3.09 \n6 11 5.29 3.80 1.33 1.84 \n7 11 7.54 3.46 2.62 3.07 \n8 11 8.43 3.72 1.94 2.17 \n9 8 2.91 3.33 1.93 2.13 \n10 7 5.45 6.16 1.94 2.15 \n11 8 13.74 5.73 2.92 2.79 \n12 10 10.97 3.94 3.47 3.75 \nHerd 110 10.61 5.79 2.69 3.05 \n \nRMSEP, residual mean squared error or prediction \nTable 4 \nResults of optimising the model at the end of run in trial 2 \nPen Final \nnumber \nof pigs \nRMSEP of \nweight before \noptimisation, kg \nRMSEP of \nweight after \noptimisation, kg \nRMSEP of fat \ndepth before \noptimisation, mm \nRMSEP of fat \ndepth after \noptimisation, mm\n1 12 5.80 6.35 3.47 3.66 \n2 12 8.48 2.52 1.89 2.47 \n3 12 10.24 4.81 3.32 3.48 \n4 12 5.71 3.66 3.52 3.40 \n5 11 13.69 8.45 3.59 3.76 \n6 11 9.59 3.52 1.77 1.82 \n7 12 7.08 6.15 2.55 2.34 \n8 6 8.54 2.48 2.43 2.67 \n9 12 7.23 3.97 2.02 2.02 \n10 12 7.28 3.67 1.64 1.77 \n11 8 9.10 2.92 2.88 2.85 \n12 12 5.60 5.80 2.52 2.26 \nHerd 132 8.41 4.95 2.73 2.80 \n \nRMSEP, residual mean squared error or prediction \n  21  \nTable 5 \nResults of the model at the end of run after optimising at day 39 in trial 1 \nPen Final \nnumber \nof pigs \nRMSEP of \nweight before \noptimisation, kg \nRMSEP of \nweight after \noptimisation, kg \nRMSEP of fat \ndepth before \noptimisation, mm \nRMSEP of fat \ndepth after \noptimisation, mm\n1 9 3.81 7.54 3.20 3.45 \n2 10 21.43 11.67 3.37 3.97 \n3 6 9.91 9.39 2.81 3.13 \n4 7 16.98 9.75 3.65 4.39 \n5 12 5.40 7.45 2.35 3.05 \n6 11 5.29 5.73 1.33 1.99 \n7 11 7.54 4.41 2.62 3.08 \n8 11 8.43 5.22 1.94 2.25 \n9 8 2.91 5.01 1.93 2.09 \n10 7 5.45 8.59 1.94 1.77 \n11 8 13.74 7.59 2.92 2.81 \n12 10 10.97 3.95 3.47 3.75 \nHerd 110 10.61 7.43 2.69 3.05 \n \nRMSEP, residual mean squared error or prediction \nTable 6 \nResults of the model at the end of run after optimising at day 39 in trial 2 \nPen Final \nnumber \nof pigs \nRMSEP of \nweight before \noptimisation, kg \nRMSEP of \nweight after \noptimisation, kg \nRMSEP of fat \ndepth before \noptimisation, mm \nRMSEP of fat \ndepth after \noptimisation, mm\n1 12 5.80 10.75 3.47 3.06 \n2 12 8.48 2.95 1.89 2.35 \n3 12 10.24 4.77 3.32 3.48 \n4 12 5.71 3.69 3.52 3.44 \n5 11 13.69 8.45 3.59 3.76 \n6 11 9.59 3.55 1.77 1.82 \n7 12 7.08 9.06 2.55 2.17 \n8 6 8.54 2.18 2.43 2.66 \n9 12 7.23 4.15 2.02 2.02 \n10 12 7.28 3.90 1.64 1.84 \n11 8 9.10 8.15 2.88 2.94 \n12 12 5.60 6.47 2.52 2.29 \nHerd 132 8.41 6.33 2.73 2.72 \n \nRMSEP, residual mean squared error or prediction \n  22  \nTable 7 \nResults of trial 1: mean deviation from target (standard error) \nPen Target weight, kg Target fat depth, \nmm \nMean deviation of \nweight from \ntarget, kg \nMean deviation \nof fat depth from \ntarget, mm \n1  16  -2.5 (2.9) \n2  16  -0.4 (0.7) \n3  12  2.3 (2.4) \n4  12  1.9 (2.8) \n5 85  -4.0 (2.2)  \n6 85  -2.3 (2.3)  \n7 75  0.9 (2.0)  \n8 75  1.5 (3.2)  \n \nTable 8 \nResults of trial 2: mean deviation from target (standard error) \n \nPen Target weight \ngain, kg \nTarget fat depth, \nmm \nMean deviation of \nweight gain from \ntarget, kg \nMean deviation \nof fat depth from \ntarget, mm \n1  12  -0.9 (0.53) \n2  12  0.2 (0.60) \n3  16  -2.1 (0.72) \n4  16  -2.4 (0.68) \n5 50  2.1 (2.4)  \n6 50  2.3 (0.9)  \n7 60  -5.8 (1.5)*  \n8 60  2.0 (2.4)  \n* -2.3 kg on day 54 \n \n  23  \n \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nW\nei\ngh\nt (\nkg\n)\nDay\n \nFig. 1.
