INTRODUCTION\nSakaki originally proposed velocity modulation as a\nmeans of obtaining fast switching in a field effect transistor\nby transferring electrons between high and low mobility\nchannels. The motivation for this approach is to remove or\nreduce the capacitive limitation on device speed that arises\nthrough modulation of the channel carrier density in a con-\nventional field effect transistor. Sakaki suggested the use of\nGaAs\/AlGaAs as the materials system1 and a few GaAs de-\nvices have been reported since then,2,3 including the dual\nchannel high electron mobility transistor ~HEMT!.4 One ad-\nvantage of using GaAs is that low-temperature-grown GaAs,\nwith naturally occurring arsenic islands, can form the low\nmobility side of the channel. These islands serve as scatter-\ning centers for electrons. In principle, these, along with ion-\nized impurities, could yield a high\/low electron mobility ra-\ntio of 40.2\nKizilyalli et al. have modeled the operation of a GaAs\/\nAlGaAs velocity modulation transistor, which had a 0.4 mm\nlong gate and a channel 1 mm long and 0.1 mm wide.5,6 This\nsimulated device made use of separate source and drain con-\ntacts to the high and low mobility sides of the GaAs channel.\nMobility modulation was achieved using compensated dop-\ning at one side of the channel. The predicted current modu-\nlation factor which defines the \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018off\u2019\u2019 states of the\ndevice was 1.6. ~It should be noted that a current modulation\nfactor of at least 10 is the requirement for a commercial\ndevice!.7 Although charge could be transferred across the\nchannel within 0.5 ps, it took rather longer ~3 ps! for the\ndrain current to reach a new steady state once the gate biases\nhad been switched. The simulated devices were driven by\ndrain\u2013source electric fields ;106 V m21; consequently the\nvelocity profiles along the undoped and heavily compensated\nsides of the channel differed by at most 25% at 300 K.\nWhile interest has focused on GaAs, the motivation here\nis to devise a terahertz transistor based on Si where the better\ndeveloped fabrication technology could facilitate the imple-\nmentation of appropriate structures. The geometries of the\nmodeled Si devices are smaller than the GaAs devices de-\nscribed above ~;0.1 mm gate length, ;0.1 mm long30.1\nmm wide channel!. Such devices are not compact enough to\nbe true quantum transport devices and a semiclassical de-\nscription of the transport should be applicable at tempera-\ntures above 77 K. Monte Carlo simulations of the devices\nhave been carried out and the electron transport model is\nsummarized in Sec. II. In Sec. III, results are discussed for\nsimulations of unstrained Si devices, showing how the dop-\ning profile and drain\/gate bias conditions influence the de-\nvice operation.\nII. MONTE CARLO MODEL\nSuperparticles that represent electrons in the ensemble\nMonte Carlo simulation are described by nonparabolic ellip-\nsoidal valleys in reciprocal space and obey classical statis-\ntics. Herring\u2013Vogt transformations are used to map carrier\nmomenta into spherical valleys when particles are drifted,\nscattered, or cross heterojunctions. The electric field equa-\ntions are solved self-consistently with the electron transport,8\nand the device grid potentials are updated at each ensemble\ndrift timestep ~1 fs!. The electric field cell size is ;5\n35 nm2. For these submicron transistors, 1000 electron su-\nperparticles are sufficient to get a good idea of the current\nswitching properties, but for the calculation of I \u2013 V curves\nand smooth switching characteristics an initial count of 4000\nsuperparticles has been used. Electrons in bulk Si may be\nscattered by ionized impurities and by bulk acoustic and non-\npolar optical phonon modes. Acoustic phonon scattering is\nassumed to be elastic and the absorption and emission rates\nare combined under the equipartition approximation, which\nis valid for lattice temperatures at and above 77 K. Ionized\nimpurity scattering in doped and compensated regions of the\ndevice is described using the screened Coulomb potential of\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS VOLUME 85, NUMBER 2 15 JANUARY 1999\n11960021-8979\/99\/85(2)\/1196\/7\/$15.00 \u00a9 1999 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 07 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

Na is the acceptor den-\nsity and Nd the donor density.\nA very simple model for scattering particles off a rough\noxide layer has been included, although this is not listed as a\nprocess in the scattering rate ladder. Instead, when a super-\nparticle is bounced off a rough heterojunction barrier, rather\nthan suffer a specular reflection it is deflected back into the\nSi at a random angle to its initial path. Band effective\nmasses, scattering potentials, and other device parameters are\nthose reported in Refs. 9 and 10. The effect of doping under\na metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor ~MOS! contact is accounted\nfor in the definition of the flat-band potentials that define the\noffset between the Fermi levels of the n11 polysilicon and\nthe doped Si layers.11 A fixed charge concentration of\n1015 m22 has been assumed to be present in the oxide layers.\nIn this article, the modeled devices are of the simplest\nkind, that is, a region of selectively doped Si grown between\ntwo SiO2 layers which serve as top and back gates to the\ndevice. The aim is to demonstrate that velocity modulation\ncan be achieved using Si as the basic material. The basic\ndesign for the simulated unstrained Si velocity modulation\ntransistor is shown in Fig. 1. The device resembles a short\nchannel field effect transistor, but the key difference is that\nthe device would be fabricated using the silicon-on-insulator\ntechnique which would allow the Si channel to be backgated\nby biasing the n11 polysilicon in the substrate. Ideally, the\nback gate oxide layer should be pared to within 10 nm to\nmaximize any depletion effect due to negative gate bias rela-\ntive to the top gate, and therefore sweep carriers from one\nside of the channel to the other efficiently. The top gate\noxide thickness is 5 nm. Devices with different doping pro-\nfiles have been modeled\u2014compensated doping has been\nplaced either under the top gate, above the back gate to the\nchannel, or is a hybrid of the two extremes.\nFor these submicron devices to operate successfully, ide-\nally three main constraints should be met.\n~i! The carrier density modulation in the channel should\nbe small in order to minimize charging\/discharging\ntime constants when switching the top and back gate\nbiases.\n~ii! The gate biases, hence the lateral electric fields gen-\nerated across the channel, must be large enough to\ncreate two distinct low and high mobility conduction\npaths within the channel.\n~iii! The drain\u2013source bias should be large enough for the\ncarrier drift velocity along the high mobility conduc-\ntion path to be maximized, but small enough for the\nimpurity-limited drift velocity in the low mobility\npath to be a fraction of that at the high mobility ~pure\nSi! side.\nThis third point is illustrated by Fig. 2, which shows drift\nmobility-field plots for electrons in pure bulk Si and in\nheavily compensated Si at 77 K. The compensated Si is of\nthe type used in the devices discussed in Sec. III ~donor\ndensity 231025 m23, acceptor density 1.9931025 m23!. At\nmoderate fields along the Si channel ;105 V m21, it ought\nto be possible to modulate the velocity by a factor of ;4\nfrom impurity scattering alone. Because ionized impurity\nscattering events are elastic and small scattering angles are\nfavored, at high electric fields and carrier kinetic energies\nthis process has less impact on the electron mobility, hence\nthe convergence of the two curves in Fig. 2.\nFrom the outset, it is clear that a velocity modulation\ntransistor of this kind would be most suitable as a fast, low\npower device. The results of Sec. III suggest that successful\nvelocity modulation is limited to a small drain bias range\nover which charge in the channel can be well controlled. The\nFIG. 1. Schematic for a possible Si based velocity modulation transistor, as\nmodeled in Sec. III.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigures 3~a!\u20133~c! provide a comparison of the switching\nbehavior of three devices which have similar geometry but\ndifferent arrangements of the compensated doping. The pa-\nrameters and bias conditions which are common to all three\nsimulations are as follows. The Si channel thickness ~back\ngate oxide to top gate oxide separation! is 80 nm, and the top\ngate extends 100 nm along the channel. The implants with n\ndoping under the source and drain contacts are both\n1024 m23 and extend half way into the Si channel. For Fig.\n3~a!, the device has compensated doping in the top half of\nthe channel not occupied by the contact implants ~donor den-\nsity 231025 m23, acceptor density 1.9931025 m23!. For\nFig. 3~b! the compensated doping is identical to that of Fig.\n3~a!, but instead this doping occupies the lower half of the\nchannel. The shorter current path through Si under the top\ngate serves as the high mobility side of the channel in this\ninstance. The device of Fig. 3~c! is similar to that of Fig.\n3~b!, but the doping in a layer 10 nm thickness above the\nback gate is less compensated for ~donor density 2\n31025 m23, acceptor density 1.931025 m23!. Note the\ngreater background density of electrons in that for Fig. 3~b!.\nFigures 3~a!\u20133~c! show the results of a sequence of\nsimulations at 77 K with different bias conditions applied at\n3 ps intervals. At time t50, each device is allowed to relax\nfrom an initial charge neutral state and it remains unbiased\nfor 3 ps. At t53 ps, each device is switched on with 0.3 V\ndrain\u2013source bias for the t53 \u2013 15 ps. However, gate biases\nare switched abruptly at 3 ps intervals. At t53 ps, 1 V is\nplaced on the top gate while the back gate is unbiased; at\nt56 ps, the top gate is at 0 V and the bias applied to the\nback gate is 1 V, and so on. ~Note: The gate biases are\nabsolute, not relative, to the flat-band voltages.! The inset\ncartoons in Figs. 3~a!\u20133~c! show the spatial distribution of\nX-valley electrons in the Si channel at t53,6,...15 ps.\nFigure 3~a! is an example of poor current modulation.\nThe device is also the most capacitive; when the back gate is\nforward biased relative to the top gate, excess electrons are\ninjected and populate the back gate side of the device, with a\ntime constant of at least 3 ps. Figures 4~a! and 4~b! show the\nelectric displacement currents at the gates for the simulations\nof Figs. 3~b! and 3~a!, respectively.

Demonstration of current switching for three devices of the kind\nshown in Fig. 1, at a lattice temperature of 77 K. The velocity modulation\ntransistors have a 0.1 mm top gate length and a 0.08 mm wide Si channel.\nThe devices differ in their channel doping profile. In ~a!, heavily compen-\nsated doping is distributed under the top gate, halfway into the channel. In\n~b! compensated doping is placed above the back gate, again halfway into\nthe channel. The doping level in both these cases is donor density 2\n31025 m23 and acceptor density 1.9931025 m23. In ~c!, a higher back-\nground density of electrons is maintained above the back gate in an effort\nto reduce capacitive charging at the back gate side of the channel when the\ndevice operates in the low mobility mode. The simulation in ~b!, was\ncarried out using a minimum of 4000 particles, but a minimum of 1000\nwas used to generate ~a! and ~c!. At times t,3 ps, the unbiased devices\nare shown converging to their steady state. At t53 ps, each device is\nswitched into the high mobility regime, with a drain\u2013source bias of 0.3 V\nand a top gate bias of 1 V. The back gate is unbiased. At t59 ps, the gate\nbiases are reversed, switching the transistor into the low mobility regime.\nThis abrupt switching is repeated at 3 ps intervals. The small inset car-\ntoons show the distribution of electrons in the device at t50,3,6,...15 ps\n~unbiased, high mobility regime, low mobility regime, etc.!.\n1198 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 85, No. 2, 15 January 1999 G. C. Crow and R. A. Abram\nDownloaded 07 Dec 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

Note that at t59 ps when the device is\nswitched from the low to high mobility mode, there is a\ntransient peak in the drain current ~duration ,0.5 ps!, due to\nthe expulsion of charge that occupied the back gate side of\nthe structure. Figure 3~c! shows an attempt to reduce\ncharging\/discharging of the channel by having a higher back-\nground electron concentration at the back gate than for the\ndevice of Fig. 3~b!. Comparison of Figs. 3~b! and 3~c! shows\nthat, while the electron density modulation is reduced, there\nis no obvious reduction in the switching time and it does lead\nto a reduced high\/low drain current ratio of 2. Note that\nlonger time taken to establish stable field conditions at the\nback gate side of the channel in Fig. 4~b!.\nHaving described the basic switching action of the Si\nvelocity modulation transistor, Figs. 5\u20138 show some micro-\nscopic details of the more successful device illustrated in\nFig. 3~b!. Figure 5~a! shows the conduction band profile\nacross the channel when a steady current flows through the\ntop gate side of the channel ~the drain\u2013source bias is 0.3 V,\nthe top gate bias is 1 V, and the back gate is unbiased!. Note\nthat the electric field along the top gate channel is\n;106 V m21 in this case. Figure 5~b! shows the band profile\nfor the device operating in the \u2018\u2018low mobility\u2019\u2019 regime, with\n1 V applied to the back gate and 0 V at the top gate. Note\nthat the steady drain\u2013source electric field along much of the\nback gate side of the channel is also ;106 V m21. Figures\n6~a! and 6~b! show the steady state electron densities that\ncorrespond to Figs. 5~a! and 5~b!. It is clear that charge is\nswitched satisfactorily from one side of the channel to the\nother. However, it is also interesting to note the small but\nsignificant background density of ;1023 m23 electrons un-\nder the contact doping at the drain end of the device that\nprovides the principal path for electrons to leave the device\nwhen it is operating in the low mobility regime.\nFigure 7~a! shows the electron flux along the source\u2013\ndrain direction ~labeled the x axis! for the device operating in\nthe high mobility regime, with a peak flux at the drain end of\nthe top gate approaching 2531028 m22 s21. In contrast, the\npeak x-axis flux along the back gate side of the channel is\n;331028 m22 s21 @Fig. 7~b!#. The y-axis flux ~the back gate\nto top gate direction! is also included @Fig. 7~c!#. Figures 8~a!\nand 8~b! show the average kinetic energies recorded for elec-\ntrons detected at different positions in the channel, but some\ncare must be taken when interpreting these data. In Fig. 8~a!,\ncarriers are clearly heated as they drift under the top gate, but\na minority of electrons are heated up to the threshold for\nintervalley phonon scattering ~;0.06 eV! and their final\nwave vectors are randomized such that they follow a parallel\nconduction path along the edge of the compensated side of\nthe channel. The average kinetic energy recorded under the\ndrain contacts in Figs. 8~a! and 8~b! is small, close to the\naverage thermal energy at 77 K; this should not be inter-\npreted as rapid cooling of the heated carriers by phonon scat-\ntering, instead most electrons under the drain are thermal\ncarriers neutralizing the charge of the ionized donor centers.\nAlthough the drain\u2013source electric fields along the top and\nback gate sides of the channel are comparable, clearly the\ncompensated doping\/rough oxide interface has some impact\non the carrier mobility, because electrons drifting along the\nback gate side of the channel are less readily heated @Fig.\n8~b!#. However, Fig. 8~b! also demonstrates that the heating\nof carriers that are drawn across the channel from the back to\nFIG. 4. ~a!,~b!

The\nscattered points show the current modulation factor that can\nbe achieved at moderate gate bias, while the solid curve\nshows the higher modulation factor ~i.e., more effective con-\nfinement to either side of the Si channel! that can be\nachieved with a combination of a larger ~1 V! gate bias and\na small ~,0.2 V! drain\u2013source bias. Estimates for the intrin-\nsic transconductance in the high mobility regime @solid curve\nin Fig. 9~d!# and low mobility mode @dashed curve of Fig.\n9~d!# have been calculated from the current\u2013voltage curves\nfor the device.\nFinally, Fig. 10 shows the simulated current switching\nbehavior at 77 K for the device of Fig. 3~b!, which has com-\npensated doping, placed above the back gate, extending half-\nway into the channel. The device is switched off ~all metal\ncontacts are unbiased! during the interval t50 \u2013 3 ps, and\nfrom t53 ps a steady drain\u2013source bias of 0.3 V is applied.\nHowever, instead of alternating the top and back gate biases\nbetween 0 and 1 V at 3 ps intervals, in this simulation the\nback gate is unbiased at all times, and only the top gate is\nswitched between 0 ~low mobility mode! and 1 V ~high mo-\nbility mode!. Similar current characteristics were obtained\nwhen the same voltage modulation procedure was simulated\nfor a conventional MOS field effect transistor ~MOSFET!\nwith the same gate and channel lengths.\nFIG. 6.

The device is shown operating in the\nhigh mobility mode ~a! with a drain\u2013source bias of 0.3 V and and a top gate\nbias of 1 V, and also in the low mobility regime ~b! with 1 V applied to the\nback gate and the top gate at 0 V.\nFIG. 7.

It is not clear if\nthe velocity modulation regime offers faster switching into\nthe low current \u2018\u2018off\u2019\u2019 state, because the time taken to dis-\ncharge the channel in Fig. 10 matches the charging time\nalong the back gate in Fig. 3~b!. This is in spite of the fact\nthat carrier density modulation in the velocity modulation\nregime is roughly half that for conventional top gate modu-\nlation; any reduction in the capacitive term of the RC time\nconstant has been offset by the increased resistance of the\ncurrent path along the back gate.\nIV. SUMMARY AND FURTHER WORK\nA Monte Carlo simulation has been used to demonstrate\ndrain current modulation in a Si velocity modulation transis-\ntor. Current switching between the top and back gate sides of\nthe Si channel is sensitive to the drain\/gate bias conditions\nand also to the doping profile in the channel. Rapid switching\n~1\u20131.5 ps! between high and low electron mobility modes\ncan be achieved. There is significant charging\/discharging of\nthe channel ~.20% variation in channel charge density!\nwhen switched between the two modes, but this is smaller\nthan in the case of a conventional field effect transistor\n~;45%!. The results suggest that the basic device could\nhandle switching cycles of at least 300 GHz operating either\nin standard top gate modulation or in the velocity modulation\nmode. The main obstacle to good device operation in the\nvelocity modulation regime remains the predicted current\nmodulation factor, typically 2\u20133, obtained from a combina-\ntion of heavily compensated doping and interface roughness\nFIG. 8.

The device is switched off ~unbiased!\nduring the interval t50 \u2013 3 ps. From t53 ps, a steady drain\u2013source bias of\n0.3 V is applied, but instead of swapping the top and back gate biases\nbetween 0 and 1 V at 3 ps intervals, the back gate is unbiased at all times,\nand only the top gate is switched between 0 and 1 V. The same voltage\nmodulation procedure carried out on the equivalent short-channel MOSFET\nproduced similar current switching behavior.\n1201J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 85, No. 2, 15 January 1999 G. C.

For velocity modulation to have a speed advan-\ntage over top gate modulation, it is clear that a way must be\nfound to reduce the carrier density modulation still further.\nThere is potential for improvement in device perfor-\nmance by including strained SiGe layers within the device. A\nlayer of compressive strained SiGe could provide a low mo-\nbility channel for electrons since they would suffer alloy\nscattering and mainly occupy X4 valleys ~half of which have\na large effective mass along the source\u2013drain axis!. How-\never, the larger heterojunction offset between Si and SiGe\npresented to X2-valley electrons could create current switch-\ning difficulties if the electrons cannot readily tunnel between\nthe two valley types across a Si\/SiGe heterojunction. A pre-\nliminary simulation carried out on a design similar to that\nreported here suggests little benefit to current modulation,\nbut further investigation is planned. It would be better to\nhave a device put down on a SiGe virtual substrate. This\nwould allow the possibility of a tensile strained Si channel,\nwhich offers the prospect of a high mobility conduction path\nfor X2-valley electrons. The present difficulty with growing\nsuch a device, however, is that of producing an appropriate\nback gate within 100 \u00c5 of the conduction channel in a SiGe\nstructure.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. D.
