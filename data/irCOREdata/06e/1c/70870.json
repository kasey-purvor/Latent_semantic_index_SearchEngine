Magnetospheric physics (magnetopause, cusp\nand boundary layers; magnetosphere-ionosphere interac-\ntions; solar wind-magnetosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nThe low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) is characterised\nby the presence of both magnetosheath and magnetospheric\nplasma inside the main magnetopause current sheet (Hones\net al., 1972; Akasofu et al., 1973; Eastman et al., 1976;\nHaerendel et al., 1978; Eastman and Hones, 1979; Sonnerup,\n1980; Sckopke et al., 1981; Mitchell et al., 1987; Hapgood\nand Bryant, 1990; Gosling et al., 1990a, b, c; Song et al.,\n1990; Sckopke, 1991; Traver et al., 1991; Fuselier et al.,\n1992; Woch and Lundin, 1993; Woch et al., 1993; Saun-\nders, 1983; Hapgood and Lockwood, 1993, 1995; Phan et al.,\n1997; Savin et al., 1997; Fujimoto et al., 1998). The origin of\nthis layer is one of the major unanswered questions in mag-\nnetospheric physics and a key unknown in this regard is the\ntopology of the LLBL field lines: it is interesting to note that\nroughly half of the papers cited above interpret the LLBL in\nterms of closed field lines, and the other half in terms of open\nfield lines. There are three main classes of theory of LLBL\nformation (see review by Sibeck et al., 1999): (1) magne-\ntosheath plasma is injected by some process (such as wave-\ndriven diffusion) onto closed field lines that are already popu-\nlated with magnetospheric plasma (Drakou, 1994; Lotko and\nSonnerup, 1995; Treumann et al., 1991, 1995; Winske et al.,\n1995); (2) The plasma mixture arises on newly opened field\nlines along which magnetosheath plasma has flowed into the\nmagnetosphere but magnetospheric plasma has yet to escape,\neither due to time-of-flight considerations (Lockwood and\nSmith, 1993; Onsager, 1994; Lockwood, 1997a, b; Fuselier\net al., 1999; Onsager and Lockwood, 1997), or ion reflec-\ntion at the reconnection layer Alfve\u00b4n waves (Cowley, 1982;\nLockwood et al., 1996) or because a magnetic bottle still ex-\nists on open field lines (Daly and Fritz, 1982; Scholer et al.,\n1982a; Cowley and Lewis, 1990; Lyons et al., 1994); (3) The\nfield lines of the LLBL had been open, allowing for the mag-\nnetosheath plasma to enter, but have subsequently been re-\nclosed by re-reconnection (Nishida, 1989; Song and Russell,\n1992; Song et al., 1994; Richard et al., 1994). In both (2)\nand (3), gradient and curvature drift across the open-closed\nboundary may sometimes help to replenish magnetospheric\nplasma that has been lost when it flowed across the magne-\ntopause along open field lines.\n1.1 Middle and low altitude signatures of the LLBL\nIn addition to observations made at the magnetopause, data\nfrom mid- (Woch et al., 1993, 1994) and low- (Newell and\nMeng, 1988, 1992) altitudes have been used to discuss the\nLLBL. The \u201ccleft\u201d precipitation is often thought of as a\nthe field-aligned projection of the LLBL (Vasyluinas, 1979;\nNewell and Meng, 1988; 1989, 1992, 1993, 1994a; Newell\net al., 1991). However, this concept does not allow for two\nimportant considerations. First, the low-altitude observations\nare of particles that are within the loss cone and the magne-\ntopause observations are of particles that are primarily out-\nside of the lost cone. Thus, the low-altitude observations of\nthe LLBL require that the loss cone is filled and this need\nnot be true of the magnetopause observations. Thus, for ex-\nample, the mechanism proposed by Song and Russell (1992)\nwill not yield a low-altitude LLBL (the filling of the loss cone\nwith magnetosheath plasma ceasing when the field lines are\nre-closed), unless one also invokes strong pitch angle scat-\ntering of trapped particles on the re-closed field lines into\nthe loss cone. Second, such field-line mapping does not al-\nlow for the effects of velocity dispersion which is significant\nfor ions in a convecting magnetosphere (Rosenbauer et al.,\n1975; Reiff et al., 1977). This dispersion does not allow for\nLLBL boundaries at high altitudes to be mapped to low alti-\ntudes whenever there is convective flow across that boundary\n(Lockwood and Smith, 1993). Since observations of dayside\nconvection show flow into the polar cap throughout much of\nthe dayside (e.g. Jorgensen et al., 1984), usually without a\npronounced restriction or throat (Heelis et al., 1976), this ap-\npears to be the case for a large fraction of the dayside. The\nopen magnetosphere model predicts that the precipitation at\nlow altitudes evolves in its classification from \u201cLLBL\/cleft\u201d\nto \u201ccusp\u201d to \u201cmantle\u201d and then to \u201cpolar cap\u201d as the field line\nevolves over the magnetopause away from the reconnection\nsite and into the tail lobe (Cowley et al., 1991; Lockwood and\nSmith, 1993, 1994; Onsager et al., 1993; Lockwood, 1995).\nThis evolution is seen in full along the flow streamlines in the\nsteady state case and thus may sometimes be seen if the satel-\nlite follows the flow streamline quite closely (Onsager et al.,\n1993; Lockwood et al., 1994). Thus, several authors have ar-\ngued that much of the low-altitude LLBL precipitation must\nbe on open field lines (Lockwood and Smith, 1993; Lyons\net al., 1994; Moen et al., 1996; Fuselier et al., 1991, 1992,\nM. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based instrument observations 1615\n1999). Other authors, while accepting that this is true when\nreconnection is taking place, now argue that there is also a\nclosed LLBL at low-altitudes nearer dawn and dusk (Newell\nand Meng, 1997). Lockwood (1997a) has shown how adopt-\ning an open topology for the LLBL solves a number of long-\nstanding anomalies.\nThe idea that the low-altitude signature of the LLBL is\nion open field lines is supported by the fact that it covers\nroughly the same longitudinal extent as the low-altitude man-\ntle (Newell and Meng, 1992), which is known to also be on\nopen field lines (Xu et al., 1995). The longitudinal extent of\nthe cusp is lower than that of both the LLBL and the mantle\n(Aparicio et al., 1991; Newell and Meng, 1992) and would\nbe set by the longitudinal variation of sheath plasma con-\ncentration (Lockwood, 1997a). In addition, studies of the\nvoltage across regions of low-altitude LLBL precipitation in\nboth hemispheres (Lu et al., 1994) show that on any one flank\n(dawn or dusk), the same voltage does not always appear in\nthe two hemispheres: we interpret this as indicating that at\nleast some of the flank low-altitude LLBL was on open field\nlines and not closed field lines in these cases. Some obser-\nvations also show LLBL-like precipitation on sunward con-\nvecting field lines (Nishida et al., 1993; Nishida and Mukai,\n1994). There is some debate as to whether these are truly\nLLBL field lines (Newell and Meng, 1994b) but the sun-\nward convection can be explained in terms of the curvature\nforce on open field lines but is inconsistent with mechanisms\nthat transfer sheath plasma and momentum onto closed field\nlines.\n1.2 The open LLBL at the magnetopause\nObservations confirm the existence of an \u201copen LLBL\u201d (a\nterm hereafter used for an LLBL on field lines that have an\nopen topology) at the magnetopause. This type of LLBL\nis characterised by accelerated flows of magnetosheath-like\nions. The evidence that they are injected and accelerated by\nflowing along newly-opened field lines includes: an observed\ndependence of the east-west flow direction on the IMF BY\ncomponent and hemisphere (Gosling et al., 1990a); results of\ntangential stress balance tests (Paschmann et al., 1979, 1986;\nSonnerup et al., 1981, 1986; Johnstone et al., 1986); obser-\nvations of D-shaped distribution functions of injected ions\n(Smith and Rodgers, 1991; Fuselier et al., 1991; Gosling et\nal., 1990b, c) as predicted by Cowley (1982); the observa-\ntion of magnetosheath electron and ion edges inside the mag-\nnetic field rotational discontinuity (Gosling et al., 1990c);\nand depleted populations of trapped particles (Scholer et al.,\n1982a; Daly and Fritz, 1982). The observations by Fuselier\net al. (1991) show that the ion distributions on both sides\nof the magnetopause of both magnetospheric and magne-\ntosheath origin are as predicted by the theory of plasma mix-\ning along open field lines. In addition, Smith and Rodgers\n(1991) applied the stress-balance test to show that the low-\nvelocity cut-off of the injected sheath population was close\nto the local de-Hoffman Teller frame velocity, as also pre-\ndicted by the theory. Thus, at least part of the magnetopause\nLLBL is formed by plasma mixing on field lines opened by\nmagnetopause reconnection. Such processes could act for all\nIMF orientations, for example, a reconnection site at high-\nlatitudes above the magnetic cusp, similar to the type studied\nby Gosling et al. (1991), has been seen to give rise to a day-\nside LLBL (Paschmann et al., 1990).\nAt this time we should clarify some semantic points about\nnomenclature. Some authors would not term an open field\nline region as an \u201cLLBL\u201d at all. Instead they would use the\nterm \u201caccelerated flows\u201d or \u201creconnection layer\u201d, as envis-\naged by Levy et al. (1964), Heyn et al. (1988) and Lin and\nLee (1993) and reserve the term LLBL for a layer on closed\nfield lines. In addition, the open LLBL produced by lobe re-\nconnection has also been referred to as an \u201coverdraped lobe\u201d\n(Crooker, 1992).\n1.3 The closed LLBL at the magnetopause\nMany researchers have discussed an LLBL on closed field\nlines (see review by Lotko and Sonnerup, 1995). Since\nthe LLBL was found to generally flow faster away from\nthe subsolar point (Haerendel et al., 1978), along with in-\ndications that it was also thinner at this point (Mitchell et\nal., 1987; Manuel and Samson, 1993), Eastman and Hones\n(1979) suggested that the LLBL was formed by the diffusion\nof magnetosheath plasma across the magnetopause. How-\never, Sonnerup (1980) pointed out that the observed waves\nwere not adequate to drive the required diffusion, a finding\nconfirmed by later studies (Owen and Slavin, 1992; LaBelle\nand Treumann, 1995; Winske et al., 1995; Treumann et al.,\n1995). Other mechanisms have been proposed for particle in-\njection onto a closed LLBL, but they were found to be either\ninvalid or inadequate. For example, one proposed impulsive\npenetration mechanism has been demonstrated to be theoret-\nically unsound (Owen and Cowley, 1991).\nNishida (1989) proposed a mechanism whereby reconnec-\ntion may be responsible for plasma populations on a closed\nLLBL when the IMF points northward. He invoked highly\npatchy reconnection such that field lines opened at one re-\nconnection site were re-closed a short time later elsewhere.\nDuring the time that the field line was open, magnetosheath\nplasma was free to flow in and magnetosphere plasma flowed\nout, thus releasing giving the observed plasma mixture which\nis trapped when the field line is closed again. More recently,\nSong and Russell (1992) and Song et al. (1994) proposed a\nsimilar mechanism, but used only two large-scale lobe re-\nconnection sites poleward of the magnetic cusps. Numeri-\ncal simulations by Richard et al. (1994) indicate that magne-\ntosheath plasma may indeed move onto closed field lines in\nthis manner during intervals of northward IMF.\n1.4 \u201cSubsolar\u201d reconnection during northward IMF\nAnother possibility is that low-latitude reconnection may of-\nten be maintained during periods of northward IMF, as it is\nduring southward IMF. The term \u201clow-latitude\u201d here means\nthat the reconnection site is between the magnetic cusps such\n1616 M. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based instrument observations\nthat it generates new open flux from closed flux. Studies of\ntranspolar voltage as a function of IMF orientation show that\nthe rate of production of such LLBL field lines must be low\nduring northward IMF (Reiff and Luhmann, 1986; Cowley,\n1984; Freeman et al., 1993; Boyle et al., 1997). Neverthe-\nless, it may be sufficient to produce an open LLBL even dur-\ning northward IMF, especially if the IMF clock angle \u03b8 IMF\nis not too small (typically > 45\u25e6). Evidence for this comes\nfrom electron and ion distribution functions and flows in the\nLLBL (Onsager and Fuselier, 1994; Fuselier et al., 1995;\nChandler et al., 1999). In addition, studies of the cusp au-\nrora during weakly northward IMF show evidence for contin-\nued low-latitude reconnection, in addition to lobe reconnec-\ntion (Sandholt et al., 1996, 1998). Such reconnection during\nnorthward IMF was also deduced by Nishida et al. (1998)\nfrom tail observations made by the GEOTAIL satellite. One\npossibility, suggested by Anderson et al. (1997), is that the\nmagnetosheath field is distorted and amplified in the plasma\ndepletion layer (which is less readily eroded during north-\nward IMF) and this allows low-latitude reconnection to con-\ntinue even when the upstream IMF points northward. Recent\nwork shows that if the IMF vector has a northward compo-\nnent, but lies at about 45\u25e6 of the magnetic equatorial plane\n(45 < \u03b8IMF < 90\u25e6), the cusp\/cleft aurora bifurcates into\ntwo bands (Sandholt et al., 1996, 1998, 1999; Lockwood and\nMoen, 1999). The higher latitude part is consistent with the\nreconfiguration of \u201cold\u201d open flux by reconnection at the lobe\nmagnetopause. There are two possible origins of the lower\nlatitude band: it could be the signature of the loss cone refill-\ning a closed northward-IMF LLBL, or it could be on newly\nopened field lines that are produced by continued sub-solar\nreconnection, despite the northward IMF component (proba-\nbly at a different MLT to the lobe reconnection site). McCrea\net al. (2000) observed the equatorward erosion of the lower\nlatitude band using EISCAT radar data and this argues for the\nreconnection origin and an open LLBL.\nHall et al. (1991) found that the counterstreaming elec-\ntrons often used to define the LLBL (for example, Taka-\nhashi et al., 1991) are present most of the time on most of\nthe dayside magnetopause. Lockwood and Hapgood (1997,\n1998) have used the ion observations and tangential stress\nbalance tests to show that the counterstreaming is well ex-\nplained as being a response of the electron gas to ion flight\ntime effects, which is required to maintain quasi-neutrality\non newly-opened field lines (Burch, 1985). The fact that\nthese electron streams are seen during both southward and\nnorthward IMF therefore implies that reconnection is nearly\nalways taking place somewhere on the magnetopause and is\nable to coat most of the boundary with newly-reconnected\nfield lines and thus counterstreaming injected sheath elec-\ntrons.\n1.5 Distinguishing of open and closed models of the LLBL\nMaking the distinction between open and closed field lines\nfrom observations of the LLBL is notoriously difficult, but\nhas usually rested on the forms of the particle distribution\nfunctions. It has been argued that particle distributions often\nused to classify field lines as closed, can arise simply in the\nopen magnetosphere model. This does not necessarily mean\nthat all of the LLBL is on open field lines, but it does im-\nply that more of it may be than previously had been thought.\nIn an open LLBL, the particle populations vary with time\nelapsed since the field line was reconnected. This means that\nany reconnection rate changes will result in spatial structure\n(\u201ccusp ion steps\u201d) in the open LLBL and cusp (Lockwood\nand Hapgood, 1997, 1998). This concept has been used suc-\ncessfully to explain spatially structured magnetosheath ion\nprecipitation at lower altitudes (Lockwood and Smith, 1992,\n1994; Lockwood and Davis, 1996; Lockwood et al., 1998).\nThere is a good reason to search for a unified mechanism\nfor a particle injection into the LLBL and a single magnetic\ntopology within the LLBL. Hapgood and Bryant (1992) have\nshown that electron temperature varies in a consistent and\nrepeatable manner with electron density throughout nearly\nall magnetopause crossings. Fluctuations in the time series\nof both quantities are produced by magnetopause motions,\nbut these are effectively caused by the satellite moving back\nand forth along what is a continuous transition in the bound-\nary rest frame. Such a transition, seen in the moments of\nthe electron gas, could be present for almost any process\nthat causes mixing of the magnetospheric and magnetosheath\npopulations. What is significant, however, is that using these\nelectron data to indicate the satellite\u2019s relative position in the\nLLBL (the \u201ctransition parameter\u201d) reveals coherent structure\nin both the ion flows and magnetic field, which are inde-\npendent of the electron measurements (Hapgood and Bryant,\n1992; Hapgood and Lockwood, 1993). Recently, Lockwood\nand Hapgood (1997) have shown that the transition parame-\nter (the degree of electron mixing) bears a simple relationship\nto time-elapsed since reconnection, showing that transition\nparameter works because there are open field lines coating\nthe magnetospheric surface, i.e. an open LLBL. With this\nbeing the case, the most significant point is that the transi-\ntion parameter ordering is effective for nearly all passes in\nall parts of the LLBL, producing coherent variations through\nstructures such as FTEs and accelerated flow events, as well\nas seemingly closed LLBL field lines (Hapgood and Lock-\nwood, 1995). It is difficult to see how the smooth coherent\nstructure could be achieved by a variety of mechanisms.\nThe identification of closed LLBL field lines has usually\nrested on two features, namely trapped magnetospheric par-\nticles and bi-directional streaming electrons.\n1.6 Trapped particles\nTrapped particles with a double loss cone pitch-angle dis-\ntributions arise on closed field lines connecting both iono-\nspheres. The particles are trapped between the mirror points\nin the two hemispheres. The problem with using such distri-\nbutions to determine the status of a field line is that they can\nalso exist on open field lines for a number of reasons.\nFirst, a magnetospheric population is not lost as soon as\nthe field line is opened. This is not only due to time-of-\nM. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based instrument observations 1617\nflight effects. The theory of Cowley (1982), as verified by\nthe observations of Smith and Rodgers (1990), Fuselier et\nal. (1991) and Fedorov et al. (1999), predicts that of the order\nof one half of the population of magnetospheric ions which\noccur on the magnetopause on an open field line is reflected\nback into the magnetosphere in such a way as to conserve the\npitch angle distribution. Lockwood (1997b) has shown how\nthese reflected ions can combine with those that have yet to\ninteract with the magnetopause to produce a population that\nappears as an undisturbed magnetospheric population. This\nwould be seen on the same open field lines on which magne-\ntosheath plasma is detected. The reflection also gives ener-\ngised ions that are often seen in the LLBL and cusp (Hill and\nReiff, 1977; Alem and Delcourt, 1995; Moen et al., 1996;\nKremser et al., 1995; Lockwood, 1997b).\nLockwood et al. (1996) proposed that ions can be reflected\nin both the interior and exterior Alfve\u00b4n waves (rotational dis-\ncontinuities) that are found in the inflows to the reconnect-\ning magnetopause from the magnetosphere and the magne-\ntosheath. Since the plasma concentration is low in the mag-\nnetosphere, the interior RD propagates at a high Alfve\u00b4n speed\nand the reflection of ions from it can give the considerable ion\nenergisation that is sometimes found in the LLBL (Williams\net al., 1987). By including this ion reflection, Lockwood\nand Moen (1996) and Lockwood (1997b) were able to obtain\nvery good matches to the ion data from the LLBL presented\nby Moen et al. (1996) and Kremser et al. (1995), respectively.\nIn addition, there may be a local maximum in the magnetic\nfield strength near the point where the field line threads the\nboundary and\/or the bow shock, and thus, there can be mag-\nnetic bottles on open field lines (Cowley and Lewis, 1990)\nwhich maintain quasi-trapped double loss cone distributions\nof both ions and electrons (Scholer et al., 1982; Daly and\nFritz, 1982). Another factor may be that energetic, large\npitch angle ions and electrons can undergo gradient-B and\ncurvature-B drifts onto open field lines. Such penetration of\nthe open field line region by magnetospheric particles would\nbe on the dawn side for electrons and on the dusk side for\nions.\n1.7 Bi-directional streaming electrons\nThe LLBL is also often found to contain bi-directional field-\naligned streams of electrons with energies of typically 20\u2013\n500 eV (Ogilvie et al., 1984; Hall et al., 1991; Traver et\nal., 1991). Ogilvie et al. (1984) suggested that these orig-\ninated from upward beams of accelerated ionospheric elec-\ntrons seen at low altitudes (Sharp et al., 1980; Klumpar and\nHeikkila, 1992; Collin et al., 1982; Burch et al., 1983). For\nadiabatic, scatter free motion, accelerated ionospheric elec-\ntrons produced in one hemisphere will arrive in the other\nionosphere via the loss cone. Thus, unless they are scat-\ntered out of the loss cone, the ionosphere in the other hemi-\nsphere must also be a source of electrons which produce\nthe observed counterstreaming. Thus, if the source of these\nstreams is indeed acceleration of ionospheric electrons, their\nbi-directional nature would prove that they were on closed\nfield lines.\nThe electron counterstreaming is often balanced (i.e. iden-\ntical in the field parallel and anti-parallel directions), which\nis often cited as evidence for an ionospheric source and thus,\nfor closed field lines (e.g. Traver et al., 1991). However, this\ncalls for the two independent ionospheric sources to coinci-\ndentally have equal strengths (in terms of fluxes) and iden-\ntical characteristics (in terms of distribution functions of the\naccelerated electrons produced). This may be unlikely, es-\npecially near the solstices when one of the sources would\nbe in summer and the other in winter, and the ionospheric\nconditions are different. Savin et al. (1997) report an associa-\ntion of ELF waves with these electrons, raising the possibility\nthat they are accelerated by such waves at the magnetopause.\nWith this being the case, the electrons could be of either mag-\nnetosheath or ionospheric origin but for the latter, an addi-\ntional acceleration and\/or heating mechanism would be re-\nquired at low altitudes for them to escape the ionosphere.\nThus, an alternative explanation of counterstreaming elec-\ntrons would place them on open field lines, where the source\nis the magnetosheath (with slight heating at the magne-\ntopause). The precipitating electrons would then mirror at\nlow altitudes and return upward, giving balanced counter-\nstreaming at all pitch angles outside the loss cone.\nThe AMPTE-UKS observations strongly suggest that the\nnature of these electron streams changes continuously as the\nsatellite traverses the LLBL, such that the density increases\nand the temperature decreases as the magnetosheath is ap-\nproached with the values that are almost identical to the\nmagnetosheath located immediately adjacent to the bound-\nary (Hall et al., 1991; Hapgood and Bryant, 1992; Lockwood\nand Hapgood, 1998). If this is indeed the case, it is very diffi-\ncult to see how these electrons are of ionospheric origin, as it\nwould require that the acceleration mechanism that is active\non the ionospheric electrons would be able to match the elec-\ntron population in the magnetosheath, such that there is no\ndiscontinuity across the last closed field line. The analysis of\nLockwood and Hapgood (1997) is a very good explaination\nof the mixing of magnetospheric and magnetosheath electron\nfluxes across the boundary, and it places the counterstream-\ning electrons on the most recently opened field lines. With\nthis being the case, the bi-directional streaming must arise\nfrom the presence of an injected (and slightly heated) sheath\npopulation which has travelled directly from the boundary\nto the satellite, as well as a population which was injected\nslightly earlier and has mirrored at low altitudes and returned\nto the satellite.\nTraver et al. (1991) also report a variation in the bi-\ndirectional stream characteristics across the LLBL and ob-\nserved the \u201chot\u201d tail of the distribution above 200 eV. They\nnote that LLBL fluxes are enhanced over both sheath and\nplasma sheet values at these energies and conclude that some\nelectron heating is required if these are to be of sheath ori-\ngin. They argued that the heating of an ionospheric source\nwas more likely. However, recent observations of electron\nflows across the magnetopause by Onsager et al. (2001) show\n1618 M. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based instrument observations\nthat such heating does indeed occur. Thus, the bi-directional\nelectron streams can be viewed as evidence for open LLBL\ntopology, rather than a closed one.\n1.8 The LLBL and Flux Transfer Events\nFlux transfer events (FTEs) were first identified in data taken\nby the ISEE 1 and 2 (Russell and Elphic, 1978, 1979) and\nthe HEOS 2 spacecraft (Haerendel et al., 1978) at the day-\nside magnetopause. The key defining features of the events\nare a bipolar oscillation in the boundary normal component\nof the magnetic field BN and a rise in the field strength |B|\nat the event centre. Studies using the nearby ISEE 1 and 2\nspacecraft suggested that the dimension of the FTEs normal\nto the magnetopause was typically of the order of 1RE (a\nmean Earth radius, 1RE = 6370 km) (Saunders et al., 1984\na, b). Statistical surveys of the occurrence of these events\nshowed that they are seen predominantly when the magne-\ntosheath or interplanetary magnetic field points southward\n(Berchem and Russell, 1984; Rijnbeek et al., 1984; South-\nwood et al., 1986; Kuo et al., 1995; Kawano and Russell,\n1996; 1997), strongly suggesting an association with patchy\nand transient magnetic reconnection (Galeev et al., 1986).\nHowever, seemingly similar events observed closer to the\nEarth, and therefore probably deeper in the magnetosphere,\nshow little or no tendency to occur during a southward inter-\nplanetary magnetic field (IMF) (Kawano et al., 1992; Borod-\nkova et al., 1995; Sanny et al., 1996). Furthermore, Sibeck\nand Newell (1995) questioned the association of magneto-\nspheric FTEs with southward IMF and magnetosheath field\norientations, pointing out that if the sheath field was used, it\nwas usually observed later\/earlier in the same pass as the FTE\nand that the sheath field direction was likely to change in the\nintervening time. In addition, they pointed out that the spatial\nstructure in the interplanetary medium can often result in the\nIMF orientation, as observed by an upstream satellite, which\ndiffers from that of the magnetosheath field, and that uncer-\ntainties in the propagation delay from the IMF monitor to the\nmagnetopause could be important. However, none of these\neffects would bias the statistical surveys toward southward\nIMF conditions, and so they do not offer an explanation of\nthe preponderance of the southward IMF\/sheath field during\nFTEs.\nLockwood and Hapgood (1998) have applied the success-\nful model of cusp ion steps (Lockwood and Smith, 1992;\nLockwood and Davis, 1996; Lockwood et al., 1998) to an\nFTE and proved that the event was a transient entry into the\nopen LLBL. Transient LLBL entries into the LLBL were ob-\nserved by Sckopke et al. (1981), and also interpreted in terms\nof LLBL thickenings. However, these events were not ac-\ncompanied by the classic bipolar boundary-normal field sig-\nnatures that define an FTE.\nThe interior of FTEs is a mixture of magnetospheric and\nmagnetosheath plasma (Thompsen et al., 1987, Farrugia et\nal., 1988; Lockwood and Hapgood, 1998), including ener-\ngetic magnetospheric ions (Scholer et al., 1982b; Daly et al.,\n1984). An important feature of FTEs is that they are not\nequilibrium structures, i.e. there is a total pressure excess\n(particle plus field) in the event core (Farrugia et al., 1988;\nRijnbeek et al., 1987; Lockwood and Hapgood, 1998).\nThe modelling of Lockwood and Hapgood (1998) con-\nfirmed that the field lines in the core of an FTE are open,\nas inferred from the ion composition (Thompsen et al.,\n1987) and ion velocity distributions (Smith and Owen, 1992).\nLockwood and Hapgood also used a variant of the method by\nLockwood and Smith (1992) to show that the field lines in\nthe core of an observed event were opened in a pulse of en-\nhanced reconnection rate. The layered structure of the event\nwas shown to be caused by the subsequent reconnection his-\ntory. Both numerical simulations and analytic theory predict\nthat such a reconnection pulse will cause an excess (unbal-\nanced) total pressure in the core of the event and this will\nthen cause the open LLBL to bulge, driving a bipolar signal\nas the signal propagates (Scholer, 1988a, b, 1989; Semenov\net al., 1991, 1995). On the other hand, Sibeck (1990) pro-\nposed that the excess pressure is not within the LLBL but in\nthe magnetosheath, making the event a ripple of the bound-\nary. Due to the reconnection signatures in the event core,\nthe Sibeck theory requires ongoing reconnection, indepen-\ndent of the pressure enhancement. This theory provoked a\ngreat deal of discussion about whether the signatures were\nbulges in the reconnection layer, caused by a reconnection\npulse (Southwood et al., 1988; Scholer, 1988a, b, 1989; Se-\nmenov et al., 1991, 1995), or corrugations of the reconnec-\ntion layer, driven by magnetosheath pressure pulses (Sibeck,\n1992; Song et al., 1994; Lockwood, 1991; Elphic, 1990).\nSearches for upstream pressure variations in the solar wind\nhave failed to find events that could act as a source of the\nrequired small-scale (of the order of 1RE) sheath pressure\nvariations (Elphic and Southwood, 1987; Elphic et al., 1994).\n2 Observations\nOn 14 January 2001, the four Cluster spacecraft approached\nthe magnetopause from the tail lobe, close to the 15:00 MLT\nmeridian. Simultaneous measurements were made using a\nwide array of ground-based instrumentation. An overview\nof this pass and of the instrumentation deployed is given\nby Opgenoorth et al. (2001, this issue), who also study\nthe intersection of the exterior particle cusp by the Cluster\ncraft at about 13:30 UT. In addition, combined Cluster and\nground-based observations of polar cap patches, seen be-\ntween 08:00 and 09:30 on this day, are discussed by Lock-\nwood et al. (2001, this issue). Figure 1 presents and overview\nof the data recorded by Cluster and EISCAT Svalbard Radar\n(ESR) between 10:30 and 14:00. Figure 1a shows the plasma\nconcentrations seen by the ESR beams pointing at low (30\u25e6)\nelevation along the northward magnetic meridian. Figure 1b\nshows the plasma concentrations along the other ESR beam,\naligned with the local magnetic field direction.

Observation of transient events seen by Cluster and the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) on 14 January 2001. (a) The plasma\nconcentrations seen in the ionosphere along the low elevation (30\u25e6) poleward beam of the ESR, are colour-coded as a function of time and\nlatitude. The centre of poleward-moving events are marked with a black line which is numbered in continuation of the events earlier on the\nsame day, as studied by Lockwood et al. (2001, this issue). (b) The observations along the field-aligned ESR beam are shown as a function\nof time and altitude.

(d) An energy-time spectrogram of the count rate of electrons observed by the HEEA detector of the PEACE\ninstrument on Cluster C3 in zone 11 (electrons moving in the +ZGSE direction). The ESR and CIS data are colour-coded using the same\nscales as in Fig. 1 of Opgenoorth et al. (2001, this issue). The PEACE data are scaled using the same scale as in Fig. 8 of the present paper.\nThe vertical dashed lines give the times of closest conjunction of the ESR and Cluster (mauve) and the ESR and the DMSP-F15 satellite\n(green).\nin zone 11 of the HEEA detector (i.e. of electrons moving\nin the +ZGSE direction) of the PEACE instrument, also on\nthe Cluster spacecraft C3: count-rates are contoured in an\nenergy-time spectrogram format.\nIn this paper, we concentrate mainly on the data taken be-\ntween 11:00 and 12:30 which includes close conjunctions of\nthe ESR with the DMSP-F15 satellite and the Cluster space-\ncraft at about 11:44 and 12:20 UT, respectively (marked by\nthe green and purple dashed lines in Fig. 1). In this interval,\nthe Cluster craft were observing the dayside magnetospheric\npopulation often termed boundary plasma sheet (BPS, e.g.\nNewell and Meng, 1992) with frequent, but brief, excur-\nsions into the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL). These\nare marked by the appearance of low-energy sheath ions and\nelectrons (predominantly at energies below 500 eV) and the\npartial or complete disappearance of magnetospheric elec-\ntrons (predominantly at energies above 500 eV), but not of\nthe magnetospheric ions. Clear-cut examples of these LLBL\nentries are seen around 11:23, 11:37 and 12:52, with a more\ncomplex but long-lived example around 12:10. Other short-\nlived examples are also seen before the cusp convected east-\nward over the craft at around 13:30 (see Opgenoorth et al.,\n1620 M. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based instrument observations\n2001, this issue) and further examples were seen in the in-\nterval after the cusp intersection and before the passage of\nthe satellites through the magnetopause (not shown here, see\nOpgenoorth et al., 2001, this issue).\nFigure 1a shows that the poleward-pointing ESR beam\ncontinued to observe poleward-moving events, as it had dur-\ning the prior interval of southward IMF (see Lockwood et\nal., 2001, this issue). The numbering scheme used in Fig. 1\nis a continuation of that used in the previous paper. How-\never, these events were slightly less frequent and migrated\npoleward at a somewhat lower phase speed that they had ear-\nlier (see Fig. 8 of Lockwood et al., 2001, this issue). An-\nother difference is that these were not, in general, seen by\nthe field-aligned ESR beam (Fig. 1b). Blelly et al. (2001,\nprivate communication) have shown that even the event that\nwas seen by the ESR field-aligned beam at around 11:00,\ndoes not have the same origin as the events (numbers 20,\n21, and 22) seen in the northward-pointing beam. At this\ntime the convection pattern was evolving in a complex way,\nfollowing the northward turning of the IMF. Figure 2 is an\noverview of the magnetic field seen by the FGM instruments\non the four Cluster spacecraft on this pass: the four panels\ngive BX, BY and BZ in GSE coordinates and |B|. All four\nspacecraft show almost identical variations on the timescales\nshown here. At the start of the plot at 11:00 [BX]GSE > 0,\nbut this reverses to [BX]GSE < 0 after about 12:00 com-\nbined with the plasma data (which show a progression from\nlobe to mantle to dayside plasma sheet), we interpret this\nas a motion of the spacecraft from tail-like field lines onto\ndayside field lines; [BY ]GSE < 0 is true at all times when\nCluster is in the magnetosphere, which is as expected for the\n15 MLT location of the spacecraft; [BZ]GSE < 0 until about\n12:05, it is approximately zero for 12:05\u201313:15, and sub-\nsequently, [BZ]GSE > 0 for the remainder of the time that\nCluster is within the magnetosphere. Thus, Cluster was ini-\ntially observing the interior boundary layers LLBL\/BPS (i.e.\non southward-pointing field lines in the magnetic cusp fun-\nnel, half way along the boundary field lines between the exte-\nrior magnetopause and middle altitudes). From 12:05\u201313:15,\nCluster was observing the field lines that connect the interior\nand exterior, and interior boundaries (BZ \u2248 0), and subse-\nquently, the spacecraft observed the exterior magnetopause\nboundary layers (BZ > 0) where they intersected the exterior\ncusp at about 13:30 (Opgenoorth et al., 2001, this issue). For\nthe LLBL entry event around 11:23, which is studied in this\npaper in detail, the spacecraft are in the interior boundary lay-\ners (BZ < 0). We also look at an event around 12:10, when\nthe spacecraft were in the region with BZ \u2248 0 and an event\naround 12:53. Within this last event is a pulse of positive BZ ,\nand this event takes place when the spacecraft are close to the\nexterior boundary layers (BZ > 0). Figure 3 of Lockwood\net al. (2001, this issue) gives the interplanetary magnetic\nfield seen by the ACE spacecraft on this day. Opgenoorth\net al. (2001, this issue) report a very high cross-correlation\nof the clock angle of the magnetosheath field (in the GSE\nZY plane) seen by Cluster, once it had emerged from the\nmagnetosphere after 15:00 UT, with the same angle seen by\nACE. The conservation of clock angle across the bow shock\nreveals a lag of 74 min between ACE and the magnetosheath.\nLockwood et al. (2001, this issue) have cross-correlated mag-\nnetic perturbation seen by the IMAGE magnetometer chain\nbefore the northward turning and derived a lag between ACE\nand the ionosphere that fluctuated around 75 min. Given that\nthe propagation delay from the magnetopause to the dayside\nauroral ionosphere is typically 1\u20132 min, these lag estimates\nare highly consistent. In the interval studied in this paper,\nthe lagged IMF is predominantly northward: the effects of\na clear northward turning of the IMF seen by ACE around\n09:50 are clearly detected around 11:00 in magnetometer de-\nflections, and the transpolar voltage from the potential model\nfits to the SuperDARN radar data. Here we concentrate on\nthe Cluster data taken in intervals marked B and C in Fig. 3\nof Lockwood et al. (2001, this issue). When allowing for the\nderived propagation lag of 75 min, these intervals correspond\nto 11:19\u201311:27 UT and 12:00\u201312:20 UT, both of which have\nnorthward IMF (for interval B, BZ \u2248 +3 nT, BY \u2248 +1.5 nT\nin GSM coordinates, giving a clock angle \u03b8IMF \u2248 26\u25e6; for\ninterval C, BZ \u2248 +3 nT, BY \u2248 \u22123 nT, giving \u03b8IMF \u2248 45\u25e6).\nHowever, both follow intervals in which the IMF BZ compo-\nnent fell briefly to near to zero (\u03b8IMF \u2248 90\u25e6), with a positive\nIMF BY .\nThis association is stressed in Fig. 3 which shows the\nPEACE electron data from Fig. 1d with the IMF clock angle\nin GSM (\u03b8IMF, Fig. 3b), and the solar wind dynamic pressure\ndata observed by ACE (PSW , Fig. 3c). The interplanetary\ndata are plotted on a time scale that is lagged by the nomi-\nnal delay of 75 min, but an additional offset of 16.5 min has\nbeen introduced between the PEACE data and the ACE data\nplots, making a total lag of 91.5 min. This lag provides a\ngood alignment of the event seen by Cluster around 12:10,\nwhen Cluster and the ESR were in close conjunction. How-\never, Fig. 3 also demonstrates that there is a general corre-\nspondence between the onset of other LLBL events and the\nincreases in the IMF clock angle. There is no correspondence\nbetween the solar wind dynamic pressure changes and this or\nany other lag. The origin of the additional lag of 16.5 min,\nhowever, requires an explanation before the LLBL events can\nbe associated with the swings of the IMF vector toward the\nmagnetospheric equatorial plane (the rises in \u03b8IMF).\n2.1 DMSP-F15 observations\nFigure 4 shows (a) the electrons and (b) the ions observed\nby DMSP-F15 as it passed equatorward, moving close to\nthe ESR field-aligned beam around 11:44. The path of the\nsatellite relative to the two ESR beams is given in Fig. 5 in\ninvariant latitude with Magnetic Local Time (3-MLT) co-\nordinates. In Fig. 4, the differential energy flux is plotted\nas a function of energy (increasing upward) and observation\ntime. The satellite entered the polar cap, passing through an\nauroral oval showing a series of inverted-V electron arcs at\n11:36\u201311:39 UT, at around 3 = 70\u25e6 and 19:00 MLT. The\npurple line in Fig. 4c shows the horizontal convection veloc-\nity perpendicular to the satellite track, which changed from\nM.

The plots shows the BX , BY and BZ\ncomponents in the GSE frame and the field magnitude |B|. Data from spacecraft C1, C2, C3 and C4 are coloured (respectively) black, red,\ngreen and magenta. (Note: in this figure, data have been plotted in the order of C1, C2, C3 and then C4 and since the data are very similar\non this time scale, the magenta line for C4 has covered much of the other three lines).\nsunward (i.e. from right to left when looking forward along\nthe orbit) to weakly \u201canti-sunward\u201d (i.e. from left to right\nacross the orbit) close to the poleward edge of this auroral\noval. The segment of the DMSP-F15 path that revealed the\nsunward flow channel and inverted-V events is marked with a\nthicker line in Fig. 5. At the poleward edge of the inverted-V\nevents, the satellite observed a convection reversal boundary,\nwith anti-sunward flow persisting thereafter.\nThe satellite was then briefly within a region where it ob-\nserved polar cap precipitation, with brief intersections of\nmagnetosheath. No significant ion flux was seen and the\nconvection was anti-sunward. This persisted until about\n11:41:30, when the satellite began to observe persistent\nsheath electron fluxes. This segment of the orbit is also\nmarked with a thick line in Fig. 4, labelled sheath-like elec-\ntrons because the spectrum is notably lacking in the lowest\nenergy electrons of the sheath distribution. At this time, weak\nfluxes of ions are seen at about 3\u201320 kV. Just before the satel-\nlite\u2019s closest conjunction with the field-aligned ESR beam\n(at around 11:44, orange and black dashed line), the elec-\ntron spectrum becomes a low-flux, low-energy sheath dis-\ntribution which persists until the satellite passes through the\nopen-closed boundary (OCB), estimated here to be at 11:45\n(red and black dashed line). The OCB is identified by the\ndisappearance of the weak sheath electron population and the\nonset of persistent BPS electrons. After 11:45, there is a brief\ndispersed electron event at low-energies and a brief drop out\nof the BPS electrons (at energies above about 1 keV). This\nmay be a brief re-encounter with the OCB, but this is not\nas clear-cut as in the example presented by Lockwood et\nal. (2001, this issue). The OCB location is also marked on\nFig. 5.\n2.2 Convection and magnetometer observations\nFigure 5 also plots the flow streamlines (equipotentials 5 kV\napart) derived by the AMIE technique for 11:40\u201311:45 UT,\nwhen the DMSP-F15 satellite was close to the ESR. The\ntechnique has used observations by the SuperDARN radars,\nground-based magnetometers, the EISCAT radars and the\nDMSP satellites. The pattern shows a dominant dusk cell\nwith only a weak dawn cell. The pattern appears to show\na convection throat at high-latitudes (3 \u2248 80 \u2212 85\u25e6) in the\nmorning sector with eastward and poleward flow into the po-\nlar cap, suggesting negative IMF BY (Heelis et al., 1976).\nHowever, the lagged IMF data at this time gives positive\nIMF BY and such an interpretation would place both the\nESR beams on closed field lines, which is inconsistent with\nthe OCB location deduced from Fig. 4. This will be dis-\ncussed again below. The evolution of the pattern to the form\nshown in Fig. 5 is presented in Fig. 6. At 11:05, the lagged\n1622 M.

(2001, this issue) for, respectively, before and after\nthe period of interest in this paper. An additional lag of 16.5 min has been introduced to obtain a good correspondence between the transient\nLLBL entries seen by Cluster and the increases in \u03b8IMF to near 90\u25e6.\nIMF had turned northward, but the convection pattern had\nyet to respond in any significant way (the transpolar voltage\nis 55 kV, which was the value it had during the prior period\nof southward IMF, see Fig. 3, Lockwood et al., this issue),\nother than a small patch of low flow which appeared just to\nthe west noon. The flow pattern had a vigorous dawn cell\nas well as the dominant dusk cell and the flows in the day-\nside polar cap were poleward and weakly westward, which\nis consistent with the weakly positive IMF BY . At 11:10,\nthe transpolar voltage had dropped to 49 kV and the slow\nflow feature evolved into an unusual distortion of the dusk\ncell around noon. The perturbation to the flow had addi-\ntional anti-sunward flow just to the west of the ESR, with\nadditional sunward flow to the west of that paint. By 11:15,\nonly the additional poleward flow could be resolved, having\nmigrated towards dusk, such that it was to the east of the\nESR. The transpolar voltage had fallen to 39 kV. At 11:20,\nthe transpolar voltage had risen again to 47 kV, primarily due\nto a second enhancement in poleward flow, which like the\nprevious one, appears first near noon. The first enhancement\nin poleward flow can still be defined and has moved further\neast (but at a slower speed), occuring around 16:00 MLT at\nthis time. After 11:25, the transpolar voltage was roughly\nconstant at a baselevel of about 35 kV. This value is likely to\nreflect the rate of open flux destruction in the tail, in which\ncase further enhancements in the dayside voltage are not go-\ning to be reflected in the transpolar voltage. It appears that\npoleward flow features form near noon at 11:10, 11:20 and\nthen migrate east.\nThis eastward propagation may offer an explanation of\nsome or all of the delay of 16 min between the IMF clock\nangle changes and the seemingly associated LLBL entry\nevent. A more detailed study of the enhancements at the\nESR\/IMAGE meridian is presented in Fig. 7, which shows\nthe 3 components of the lagged IMF data (by the nominal\n75 min), the electron data seen by PEACE-C4 (panel d), and\nthe upward continuation of the ground BX perturbation, BX \u2032,\nseen by the IMAGE chain, in the same format as used by\nLockwood et al. (2001, this issue). A positive X (north-\nward) component (BX \u2032 > 0) is a response to an eastward\ncurrent. If the magnetometers are responding to a Hall cur-\nrent in the E-region (i.e. horizontal uniformity of conductiv-\nities can be assumed), this corresponds to a westward con-\nvection velocity in the F-region. Note that the yellow and\nred colours reveal positive BX \u2032 (eastward current and thus\nwestward flow) whereas green and blue reveal negative BX \u2032\n(westward current and thus eastward flow). Between 11:00\nand 12:00 (roughly 14:45\u201315:45 MLT), westward flow was\nseen poleward of weaker eastward current south of the ESR;\nonly the former of these can be seen in the AMIE flow pat-\nM.

Figure 7e shows clear increases in\nBX\n\u2032 a few minutes (respectively about 7 and 5 min) before\nthe first two LLBL entry events at Cluster (at around 11:23\nand 11:37 UT, Fig. 7d). Note that the first of these is clear\nat the highest latitudes, but is slightly masked by the (declin-\ning) residue of enhanced BX \u2032 due to the southward IMF prior\nto the northward turning. For these two events, the relevant\npart of the IMAGE magnetometer chain is at an MLT 49 and\n35 min ahead of Cluster. For the third LLBL event around\n12:10, there is an almost a coincident enhanced BX \u2032 event.\nIn this third case, IMAGE is at essentially the same MLT as\nCluster. These data are consistent with events propagating\neastward at about 7 min of MLT per min (roughly 0.9 km s\u22121\nat ionospheric altitudes), and giving both the enhanced flow\nsignatures (detected as BX \u2032 increases) and a transient entry\nof the Cluster spacecraft into the LLBL.\nIf these events are also manifest as the poleward flow en-\nhancements near noon as seen in Fig. 6 (that commence in\nthe intervals from 11:05\u201311:10 and 11:15\u201311:20), they must\nhave moved from noon to the IMAGE meridian at the higher\naverage speed of 14 min of MLT per 1 min (approximately\n1.8 km s\u22121) between 12 MLT and 14 MLT (double the av-\nerage speed between IMAGE and Cluster at 14 MLT and\n15 MLT). This is consistent with the flow perturbations high-\nlighted in Fig. 6, as they move rapidly initially east and then\nthey slow down. Thus, the first detected signatures of the\nevents seen by Cluster appear to be the flow enhancements\nnear noon at about 11:07:30 and 11:17:30 in the AMIE con-\nvection plots. These are both just 5 min after the transient\nswings of the IMF to a near 90\u25e6 clock angle and if one al-\nlows for the magnetopause to ionosphere propagation delay\nof 1\u20132 min, this is then within the uncertainty of the nominal\nlag estimate of 75 min.\n2.3 Cluster observations\nFigures 8 to 11 present a detailed analysis of the Cluster data\nfrom the interval of 11:19 to 11:27, which includes the sec-\nond of the transient LLBL events shown in Fig. 1.

The separations are also given in\nboundary-normal coordinates (L, M , N ). The boundary-\nnormal orientation was first determined from a model since\nthe spacecraft did not intersect the magnetopause until some\nconsiderable time after the events discussed here. How-\never, when it did intersect the magnetopause at around 15:30,\nthe boundary-normal coordinates were found by the mini-\nmum variance technique to be almost exactly the same as\nthose for this model.

The top\nfour panels show the data, from top to bottom, the HEEA\ndetector of PEACE for spacecraft C1, C2, C3 and C4. Data\nare shown for zone 11, i.e. the electrons are moving in the\n+ZGSE direction. This zone gives a continuous data series\nat the highest time resolution. The count rates (proportional\nto differential energy flux) are shown in spectrogram format\nas a function of energy and time. Also shown are data from\nthe three functioning CIS ion instruments (on board, in or-\nder, C1, C3 and C4). The differential energy flux is shown\nin energy-time spectrogram format, integrated over all pitch\nangles. The arrows mark the appearance and disappearance\nof the lowest energy (< 100 eV) magnetosheath electrons\nin the PEACE data. They are reproduced on the CIS data\npanels. It can be seen that these points also mark the ap-\npearance and disappearance of the largest fluxes of magne-\ntosheath ions. However, careful inspection reveals that there\nare some lower fluxes of sheath ions seen outside these two\narrows, particularly by C1 and C3. Outside of the arrows,\nthe electron data reveal both a continuously dispersed disap-\npearance and reappearance of magnetospheric electrons and\na similarly dispersed appearance and loss, respectively, of\nlower energy sheath electrons. This reveals that the space-\ncraft has passed through a layered structure, rather than wit-\nnessing a transient loss of magnetospheric electrons (for the\nlatter, the highest energy sphere electrons would have reap-\npeared first and the lowest energy sheath electrons would\nhave disappeared last). This layering is consistent with the\nsatellite passing onto open field lines along which magneto-\nsphere electrons were lost by flowing out across the magne-\nM.

The time-of-flight dispersion of\nboth reveals that the satellites passed onto field lines that had\nbeen open for longer at the event centre before returning to\nclosed field lines. The magnetospheric ions are the apparent\ndifficulty in this interpretation. Figure 8 shows that their flux\nis not really altered much at all in the event and remains con-\nstant, even when the magnetosheath ions are present. This\ncannot be an effect of the longer flight time of the ions (com-\npared to electrons of the same energy) since the sheath ions\nhave had time to arrive. Data from the RAPID instrument\nat higher energies confirms the decrease in flux of magneto-\nspheric electrons but only small reductions in the flux of the\nions (Wilken et al., 2001, this issue). The lack of any tran-\nsient decrease and recovery in the magnetosperic ions shows\nthat their maintenance is not due to drifts onto opened then\nre-closed field lines. Thus, if the satellite is moving onto,\nand then deeper into open field lines in this event, some pro-\ncess is maintaining the flux of magnetospheric ions on these\nnewly-opened field lines. The only alternative explanation\nis that the sheath plasma has been injected onto closed field\nlines, but this does not explain the loss of the magnetospheric\nelectrons, nor the dispersion ramps outside the arrows.\nFigure 9 gives the moments of the ion gas, as observed by\nthe CIS instrument on spacecraft 4. The times of the relevant\npair of arrows in Fig. 8 are given by the two vertical lines.\nThe panels show: (a) the proton number density, N(H+); (b)\nthe alpha particle number density, N(He++); (c) the field-\nparallel ion temperature, T||; (d) the field-perpendicular ion\ntemperature, T|; and the ion velocity components; (e) VX,\n(f) VY ; and (g) VZ , in GSE coordinates. The number den-\nsity of protons and alpha particles shows the same wave-\nform, such that the fraction of alpha particles is about 10%\nthroughout. The mixing of the two populations means that\nthe lower temperature sheath plasma depresses the temper-\natures in the event, in particular, the perpendicular temper-\nature which falls from typical magnetospheric values of the\norder of 5\u00d7 107 K for this location close to the dayside mag-\nnetopause to of the order of 2 \u00d7 106 K in the event cen-\ntre which is typical of sheath values for this magnetopause\nlocation. The number densities confirm that there is addi-\ntional plasma outside the event boundaries, particularly in\nits wake, but they have only a small effect on the average\ntemperatures. At the event centre, the velocities are of the\norder of [VX]GSE = \u221220 km s\u22121, [VY ]GSE = 25 km s\u22121 and\n[VZ]GSE = \u221225 km s\u22121. Although these point away from\nnoon around the magnetopause, these are much smaller val-\nues than the values seen once Cluster does emerge from the\nmagnetopause and into the sheath, which average [VX, VY ,\nVZ]GSE = [\u2212170, 65,\u221270] km s\u22121 (see below). These char-\nacteristics clearly define the plasma as being the low-latitude\nboundary layer (LLBL) with a mixture of magnetospheric\nplasma and magnetosheath plasma, flowing anti-sunward,\nbut at much slower speed than the sheath itself. (Mozer et\nal., 1994).\nThe spacecraft potential is measured by the EFW instru-\nment on each spacecraft and varies with the ambient plasma\nconcentration. Figure 10 shows the values for spacecraft C1\n(in black), C2 (red), C3 (green) and C4 (blue). All space-\ncraft see the same variation, with minima outside a main\ncentral enhancement where the magnetospheric electrons are\nlost and magnetosheath plasma are gained, respectively. All\nsatellites see a small secondary peak after the main peak, as\ncan be seen in the N[H+] and N[He++] variations in Fig. 9.\nThe signatures are nested to some extent, with C4 entering\nthe event last and emerging from it first. Table 1 shows that\nC4 is the furthest from the nominal magnetopause location (it\nhas the largest |Dmp|) and thus this supports the concept of a\ntravelling indentation of the boundary. Nesting is not so clear\nfor the other spacecraft. The order of the observed event du-\nrations (from longest to shortest) is C2, C3, C1, C4; whereas\nM.

The arrows in Fig. 10 are at the same times as those in\nFig. 8: they are colour-coded using the same scheme as the\ngraphs. The duration and nesting of the events defined this\nway are similar to those derived from the EFW spacecraft\npotential data.\nCross-correlating the signatures seen by EFW at the space-\ncraft gives a phase lag between spacecraft, which can be\nused to give one estimate of a phase velocity of [VX,\nVY , VZ]GSE = [\u221224, 0, 9] km s\u22121 , which in turn yields\nV|| = 1 km s\u22121 and V\u22a5 = 26 km s\u22121 in relation to\nthe average magnetic field direction and [VL, VM , VN ] =\n[\u221214.3,\u221217.7,\u221211.31] km s\u22121 in boundary-normal coordi-\nnates. The event is moving anti-sunward into the magneto-\nsphere, rather than around its dusk flank. Thus, the event\ndemonstrates a field-perpendicular convection of flux tubes,\nprimarily moving in the anti-sunward (\u2212X) direction. Us-\ning the Tsyganenko T96 model with appropriate inputs, this\nvelocity maps to a speed of ionosphere Vi \u2248 0.8 km s\u22121,\nin a direction poleward and away from noon around the af-\nternoon sector.

The phase mo-\ntion is much lower than the exterior sheath speeds seen af-\nter the magnetopause crossing. Average velocities for 5 min\nafter the satellites emerge from the sheath (i.e. for 15:09\u2013\n15:14 UT) are [VX, VY , VZ]GSE = [\u2212170, 65,\u221270] km s\u22121,\ngiving [VL, VM , VN ] = [35.7,\u2212133.0,\u2212137.7] km s\u22121.\nThe large negative VN probably indicates that the satel-\nlites are already deep into the magnetosheath for much\nof this time. The best alignment of sheath flow\nwith the nominal boundary plane is seen at 15:06:10,\nwhen [VX, VY , VZ]GSE = [\u221280, 100,\u221215] km s\u22121, giving\n[VL, VM , VN ] = [44.5,\u2212117.1 \u2212 28.1] km s\u22121. For either\nestimate, the sheath flow velocity is an order of magnitude\nlarger than the event phase velocity. Both the event mo-\n \n \n \nFig. 10.

The arrows correspond to those\nplotted in Fig. 8.\ntion and the sheath flow are towards dusk (negative M com-\nponent), but the event motion is equatorward (negative L),\nwhereas the sheath flow is poleward (positive L), indicating\nthat the magnetic curvature force, as well as the sheath flow,\nis playing a role in the field line evolution. The tension force\nmust have a strong component in the \u2212L direction, implying\na high-latitude reconnection site. The large differences be-\ntween both the magnitude and the direction of the event ve-\nlocity and the sheath velocity mean that this event is certainly\nnot a boundary indentation caused by a feature propagating\naround the magnetosphere in the magnetosheath.\nFigure 11 shows the magnetic field observations during\nthis event in the boundary-normal frame, using the boundary-\nnormal orientation discussed earlier. Fig. 11 shows no co-\nherent signal in the boundary-normal component, BN , and\ncertainly no bipolar signature that could be interpreted as\nan FTE. However, primarily due to an increase in the BM\ncomponent, there is a weak peak in the field magnitude, |B|.\nThus, the event appears to be an FTE in all but one respect:\nit has a dimension of about 1RE in its direction of motion; it\nis moving anti-sunward into the polar cap and the motion is\nfield-perpendicular; it contains a mixture of magnetosphere\nand magnetosheath plasma. The only feature lacking is the\nbipolar signature in the boundary-normal field.\nUnfortunately, skies over Svalbard were cloudy at the time\nof this event and thus, we could not use auroral imagers to ob-\nserve any corresponding phase motion in the mid-afternoon\nauroral ionosphere. However, after the skies cleared, such\nobservations were possible for the less clear-cut event around\n12:10. These are discussed in the next section.

The event lasts longer\nat all spacecraft, but sheath electron fluxes at the centre of the\nevent are not as strong. There are more complex entries and\nexits from the event (in particular, for the exit from the event\nby C2), possibly implying corrugation and wave activity.\n2.4 Auroral observations\nFigure 13 shows a sequence of images taken at 630 nm by the\nall-sky camera at Ny A\u02dalesund, Svalbard from 12:00\u201312:34.\nThe images are in a geographic frame, with northward to the\ntop of each image and lines of constant geographic latitude\nand longitude marked. Each frame also shows the outline of\nSvalbard, the east coast of Greenland, and the mapped foot-\nprint of Cluster as a function of time. The luminosity to the\nsouth in each frame is scattered sunlight. Frames represent\n1 min integrations, shown every 2 min and the luminosity has\nbeen mapped by assuming it arises from 250 km altitude.\nAt 12:00, there was little 630 nm luminosity along the au-\nroral oval: what did exist was strongest amount to the west of\nSvalbard near the east coast of Greenland. The MLT of the\nobserving station at 12:00 is \u223c 4:45 h, and the western limb\nof the imager field-of-view is at an MLT of \u223c 2:15 h (for an\nassumed emission altitude of 250 km). Thus this 630 nm lu-\nminosity was in the right location near noon for it to be classi-\nfied as the cusp aurora. At 12:00, it was primariy to the north\nof the line denoting the path of the mapped Cluster footprint.\nBy 12:02, this noon cusp aurora had brightened and moved\nequatorward. Both the brightening and equatorward motion\n(compare its position relative to the Cluster path) continued\nuntil 12:08. This erosion is expected for enhanced recon-\nnection, which allows for the mean radiative lifetime of the\n630 nm emission at 110 s plus 1 min for the time-of-flight of\nsufficient enough ions to allow the electron precipitation flux\nto become sufficiently large. This means that a reconnection\npulse took place near noon at about 12:00\u201312:05. Figure 3\nshows that with the nominal lag of 75 min, the IMF clock an-\ngle was increased in a pulse (during which it rose above 90\u25e6)\nbetween 11:54\u201312:00. Thus, this feature appears to be a re-\nsponse to the southward turning of the IMF seen by ACE, but\nwith a lag that is about 5 min longer than the nominal value\nof 75 min. This is certainly within both the uncertainty and\nthe fluctuation level of the lag estimates.\nAt subsequent times (12:08\u201312:18), the enhanced aurora\nspread eastward towards Svalbard. The appearance of a\nrayed feature to the east of Svalbard after about 12:14 marks\nits arrival at the zenith of the instrument. Note that this fea-\nture is almost certainly exaggerated in size and subsequent\nimages, since the emission comes from a wide range of al-\ntitudes and not just the 250 km (which is near the peak of\nthe volume emission rate) that had been assumed. Given that\nenhanced luminosity first appears about 2 h of MLT to the\nwest of Svalbard at 12:02, this is an approximate average\n1630 M.

Same as Fig. 8 for the interval 12:00\u201312:20 UT.\npropagation speed of 10 min of MLT per min (corresponding\nto an ionospheric phase speed of 1.3 km s\u22121, very similar to\nthe initial eastward expansion speeds inferred from the multi-\ninstrument study of the event around 11:23). At subsequent\ntimes, the cusp aurora continues to brighten and careful in-\nspection reveals fine structure, with a series of events propa-\ngating poleward and expanding to the east.\nFigure 12 shows that the arrival of sheath electrons in the\nCluster LLBL intersection began at about 12:07 which, if\none allows for the particle propagation delay and the radia-\ntive lifetime, corresponds to the image at about 12:10. This\nis about 4 min before the expanding 630 nm aurora reached\nSvalbard and the Cluster footprint. Given the uncertainties of\nthe field line mapping, it is more than possible that the event\nseen by Cluster is related to the eastward-expanding 630 nm\nevent. Note that the expansion from first onset at 12:02 to the\nMLT of the ESR and Cluster (at about 12:14) explains much\nof the additional 16.5 min lag required to relate the Cluster\nLLBL entries and the clock angle changes in Fig. 3.\n2.5 Cluster magnetometer observations of an event in the\nexterior boundary layer\nFigure 1 shows that the series of LLBL intersections persists\nup to the cusp intersection at 13:30, and a particularly clear-\ncut particle event is seen around 12:53.

The same as Fig. 11, for the interval 12:45\u201313:00 UT.\nthe magnetometer data from the four spacecraft at this time,\nwhen Cluster was close to emerging into the exterior bound-\nary layers. A signature begins to emerge for this event,\nwhereas the interior boundary layer events show no clear\nmagnetic signature (Fig. 11). Figure 14 shows that this event\ndisplays a clear enhancement of the negativeBL in boundary-\nnormal coordinates; 3 of the 4 spacecraft show a reduction in\nthe magnitude of the negative BM and there is a signature in\nthe boundary normal field BN seen by all spacecraft. The\nmagnitude of the field |B| is increased in a broad peak.\nIn fact, careful inspection of both the electron and ion data\nin this event reveals that it was a double event (Fig. 1) and\nthis is also seen in Fig. 14 which shows peaks in |BL| and\n|B|. In addition, the BN data reveal two bipolar signatures\n(with first 1BN negative, then positive) centred at 12:52\nand 12:58. Outside the events, the field is pointing towards\ndawn and sunward ([BX]GSE \u2248 \u22123 nT, [BX]GSE \u2248 \u221220 nT,\n[BZ]GSE \u2248 0), so that the negative\/positive polarity signal is\nconsistent with two bumps in the magnetopause propagating\nanti-sunward and eastward over the spacecraft. These signa-\ntures are thus a pair of FTEs.\n3 Discussion and conclusions\nWhen approaching the magnetopause on an outbound pass\non 14 January 2001, Cluster underwent a series of brief in-\ntersections with the Low-Latitude Boundary Layer (LLBL),\nboth before and after it intersected the cusp at about 13:30\n(Opgenoorth et al., 2001, this issue). These are similar events\nto those observed by INTERBALL, as reported by Savin et\nal. (1997), and by GEOTAIL, as reported by Fujimoto et\nal. (1998) but are here observed by the four Cluster space-\ncraft.\nThe dispersed disappearance and reappearance of magne-\ntospheric electrons on the edges of these events is consistent\nwith the satellite moving into an open LLBL, as is the ap-\npearance of sheath ions. This electron dispersion was also\nseen in the FTE event studied by Farrugia et al. (1988) and\nmodelled by Lockwood and Hapgood (1998). However, that\nevent also showed continuous dispersion of ions. The step-\nlike edges of the injected ion events reported here is also con-\nsistent with this model, provided the reconnection is pulsed\nand falls to zero between the pulses (Lockwood and Davis,\n1996). The two main difficulties with this interpretation are:\n(1) the maintenance of magnetospheric ions (but not elec-\ntrons) on the open field lines and (2) the slow convection\nvelocities of the flux tubes. Considering the former, Fig. 1c\nshows that some events display slight decreases in magne-\ntospheric ion fluxes; this is the clearest for the event around\n12:52. The theory of Cowley (1982) and modelling by Lock-\nwood (1997b) offers an explanation in terms of ions which\nare accelerated from the reflection off of the Alfve\u00b4nic distur-\nbances in the reconnection layer (open LLBL), in particular,\nthe external RD (Alfve\u00b4n wave), the magnetopause, and the\nfaster internal RD. Lockwood and Moen (1996) have used\nion reflection off the Alfve\u00b4n waves at an open magnetopause\nM. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based instrument observations 1633\nto match the partial moments of LLBL and cusp ions, and\nLockwood (1997a) was able to reproduce the full spin angle\ndistributions. Lockwood and Hapgood (1998) used the the-\nory to match the moments and distributions of the ions seen\nwithin an FTE. Because there is no transient loss and then re-\ncovery of magnetospheric ions at the start of the events, there\nis no reason to invoke re-closure of opened field lines.\nThe remaining difficulty is that the field lines are moving\nat a velocity that is an order of magnitude slower than the\nsheath flow, which has been used as evidence for a closed\ntopology (Fujimoto et al., 1998). The presence of sub-\nAlfve\u00b4nic ions and electrons means that the field line motion\nwould have responded to the opening of the field lines. Thus,\nfor these field lines to be open, we must conclude that the\ntension force is counteracting the effect of the sheath flow\non the part of the field line that is outside the magnetopause,\nsuch that the field lines are hung up on the dusk flank of the\nmagnetosphere.\nTable 2 summarises the evidence concerning the key ques-\ntions of the magnetic topology of the field lines within the\ntransient LLBL events. It can be seen that there are prob-\nlems with either explanation. However, possibilities exist for\nexplaining all features for an open topology (or with opened\nand then re-closed), and this is not the case for a closed topol-\nogy.\nThe magnetic field measured by FGM in both the magne-\ntosheath and the boundary layer was of the order of 20 nT, but\nthe plasma density seen by CIS was of the order of, respec-\ntively, 107 m\u22123 and 2 \u00d7 105 m\u22123. Using the mean ion mass\nof 1.3 amu seen by CIS on both sides of the boundary (10%\nHe++ and 90% H+), we find that the exterior and interior\nmagnetopause Alfve\u00b4n waves propagated at a speed VA of the\norder of 120 km s\u22121 and 850 km s\u22121, respectively. Reflection\noff of these waves gives an acceleration of ions by up to 2VA\n(Cowley, 1982; Lockwood et al., 1996), which means the\npeak of the distribution function is shifted to 470 eV for pro-\ntons (1.88 keV for He++) for the exterior wave and 23.5 keV\n(0.94 MeV for He++) for the interior wave. Considering the\nhot tail of the initial field-parallel magnetospheric distribu-\ntion, it can be seen that reflection of the interior wave will\nreadily generate MeV ions in the LLBL and cusp on open\nfield lines, as well as maintaining fluxes of unaccelerated\nmagnetospheric ions on open field lines (Lockwood, 1997b).\nComparison of the CIS and PEACE spectrograms at the\nonset of the intersection with the cusp event (13:22\u201313:27)\nis identical to the onset of one of the clear-cut events shown\nin this paper (e.g. 11:18\u201311:23). The same is true for the\n(somewhat protracted) exit from the cusp event. The differ-\nence appears to be that in the cusp event, the satellite moves\nonto field lines that have been open long enough for all mag-\nnetospheric electrons to vanish and for the low energy ion\nelectron fluxes to rise to about half of the values in the lo-\ncal magnetosheath. Thus, we conclude that the cusp inter-\nsection event studied by Opgenoorth et al. (2001, this issue)\nis exactly the same, in principle, as the events studied here,\ni.e. newly-opened flux was formed by reconnection in the\nmorning sector and dragged eastward to the satellites in all\ncases. The only difference is that more open flux was formed\nin the cusp event than in these LLBL events and they con-\nvected further over the Cluster spacecraft so that they sam-\npled field lines of greater elapsed time since reconnection.\nIn the cusp event, as in the LLBL events presented here, an\nadditional propagation lag was required to match the IMF\nclock angle variations to the event. As for the events studied\nhere, ground-based data reveal that the lag was due to event\nformation in the pre-noon sector and propagation to the mid-\nafternoon location of the spacecraft.\nThe events take place during predominantly northward\nIMF and appear to be triggered by swings of the IMF towards\nthe ecliptic so that the IMF clock angle approaches 90\u25e6 in\nGSM coordinates. However, the lag is 15\u201320 min longer than\nobserved both before and after the period of interest here.\nThe ground-based observations explain this additional delay\nbecause signatures in both the flows and in the 630 nm au-\nrora indicate that the events form in the pre-noon sector and\nmost of the additional delay is the time taken for the events to\npropagate eastward to the mid-afternoon sector. The speed of\nthe eastward phase motion seen by the ground-based instru-\nments (of the order of 1 km s\u22121) is consistent with the phase\nmotion of the event derived from multi-spacecraft studies us-\ning Cluster. The propagation of active segments of reconnec-\ntion X-lines away from noon was first inferred from EISCAT\nradar data by Lockwood et al. (1993) and sketched schemat-\nically by Lockwood (1994). Lockwood et al. (1995) used\nthis concept to show that FTEs can be responsible for the full\ntranspolar voltage. Recently, Milan et al. (2000) has found\nfurther evidence for this concept in HF coherent radar data\nand UV global images: it has also been used to explain multi-\ninstrument and multi-point data by McWilliams et al. (2001).\nThe occurrence of these events is consistent with the\nidea that \u201csubsolar\u201d reconnection (meaning the production\nof open field lines by the merging of closed field lines and\ndraped interplanetary field lines, which may take place away\nfrom the equatorial plane) persists when the IMF is north-\nward, at least as long as the IMF clock angle is greater than\nabout 45\u25e6. The direction of motion of the event is in the\n\u2212L direction (equatorward), whereas the local sheath flow is\nin the +L direction, suggesting the magnetic curvature force\nhas an equatorward component and that the reconnection site\nresponsible for the reconnection pulse was at high-latitudes.\nThe ESR observed poleward-moving events which are also\nthought to be reconnection pulse signatures. The lower oc-\ncurrence rate of events, compared to the earlier interval of\nsouthward IMF (Lockwood et al., 2001, this issue) is con-\nsistent with the triggering of the northward IMF events by\nswings of the IMF to a greater clock angle. The events were\nnot, in general, seen by the field-aligned ESR beam. For\nmuch of the period, this may be due to the fact that the beam\nwas equatorward of the open-closed boundary. However, this\nwas not the case during the pass of the DMSP-F15 satellite\njust after one of the events and not long after the northward\nturning. This revealed the ESR field-aligned beam to be on\nopen field lines. However, these were \u201cold\u201d open field lines\nfor which the magnetopause threading point was located a\n1634 M.

Ionospheric events Not explained Well explained as reconnection pulses\nconsiderable distance down the tail and hence, sheath pre-\ncipitation fluxes were low. The newer open field lines were\nseen as a region of higher sheath fluxes that were to the dusk\nside and not near noon. We can identify this patch of sheath\nplasma precipitation with one of the poleward-moving en-\nhancements seen by the low elevation ESR beam.\nGiven that these events are well understood as transient\nplasma injections caused by bursts of reconnection, the one\nmajor surprise is that there was no bipolar deflection in the\nfield seen by cluster, at least in most of the cases. This is the\nclassic characteristic used to define FTEs. However, it is im-\nportant to remember where these Cluster observations were\nmade. Most of the events were seen on southward-pointing\nfield lines, i.e. on the boundary of the interior magnetic cusp,\nhalf way between the magnetopause boundary layer and its\nprojection at middle altitudes. Only the last events, for which\nthe satellites were moving onto a northward pointing field,\nshowed indications of bipolar FTE field signatures. Even in\nthese cases, the bipolar signature was weak; however, we\nnote that BZ was still close to zero and thus, the satellites\nwere only just entering the exterior boundary layer. We con-\nclude that the bipolar FTE signatures are a feature only of the\nexterior boundary layer. They are not seen on the southward-\npointing field on the edges of the interior magnetic cusp (nor\nare they seen at middle altitudes).\nThe lack of a bipolar magnetic signature for the first\nevent studied here (at around 11:23) is due to the fact that\nthe event does not bulge out in response to increased pres-\nsure from within the event. The magnetic field magnitude\n(pressure) is of the order of 30 nT (0.36 nPa) in the event\ncentre and 24 nT (0.23 nPa) outside of it. Thus the field\npressure excess for this event is 1.3 nPa. Figure 9 shows\nthat the ion concentration, parallel temperature and perpen-\ndicular temperatures at the event centre are of the of or-\nder 6.31 \u00d7 105 m\u22123, 2.51 \u00d7 107 K and 3.16 \u00d7 106 K, re-\nspectively. The corresponding values outside the event are\n2.00 \u00d7 105 m\u22123, 6.31 \u00d7 107 K and 6.31 \u00d7 107 K. These\nnumbers yield a roughly isotropic ion pressure outside the\nevent of 0.17 nPa, but field-perpendicular and field-parallel\nion pressures of 0.03 Pa and 0.22 nPa inside it. Thus, the drop\nin field-perpendicular ion pressure was 0.14 nPa and there\nwas a slight rise in the field-parallel ion pressure of 0.05 nPa.\nFull pressure balance considerations (including the electron\ngas) will be made elsewhere, but we note that the increased\nmagnetic pressure in this event is comparable with the drop\nin the field-perpendicular ion pressure. Thus, these events\nare much closer to existing a pressure equilibrium than are\nthe FTEs on the exterior boundary: with this being the case,\na bipolar magnetic signature is not expected.\nThis can be contrasted with the event closer to the outer\nboundary around 12:50 (for which a bipolar magnetic FTE\nsignature was seen). In this event, the field magnitude rose\nM. Lockwood et al.: Coordinated Cluster and ground-based instrument observations 1635\nfrom 20 to 24 nT, giving a modest field pressure increase of\n0.04 nPa. The ion concentration variation was similar to the\n11:23 case, but the perpendicular temperature fell to only\n3\u00d7107 K, such that the field-perpendicular ion pressure rose\nfrom 0.17 nPa outside the event to 0.25 nPa inside it. Thus,\nboth the magnetic and ion pressures show an excess in this\nevent, which is consistent with the bipolar field signature and\nwith FTE events on the exterior magnetopause boundary.\nAcknowledgements.
