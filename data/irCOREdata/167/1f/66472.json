INTRODUCTION\nWhen a crystal is cleaved to expose a surface, the surface\natoms are left with unsaturated chemical bonds. In an effort\nto reduce the density of these dangling bonds, the atoms in\nthe top few layers rearrange, giving rise to a surface recon-\nstruction. The study of such surface reconstructions, particu-\nlarly in the case of the nitrides, is attracting considerable\nattention due to their importance from both a technological\nand fundamental point of view. For the development of de-\nvice fabrication processes it is essential to achieve a good\nunderstanding of the atomic-scale structural, electronic, and\nchemical properties of semiconductor surfaces, and that is\nthe motivation of the current work.\nIn recent years the III-V nitrides GaN, AlN, and InN have\nemerged as important materials due to their potential opto-\nelectronic device applications1 and are now the subject of\nenormous interest. Applications are mainly in the blue and\nultraviolet spectral region,2 with recent successful progress\nin the industrial fabrication of wurtzite GaN-based light-\nemitting diodes3 \u0001LED\u2019s\u0002 having made the nitride semicon-\nductors major competitors in the optoelectronic market. The\nelectronic band gaps of the nitrides range up to 6.2 eV \u0001Ref.\n4\u0002 and hence span the entire visible region and beyond into\nthe UV.\nUnder ambient conditions GaN crystallizes in the hexago-\nnal wurtzite phase5 but can also be grown in the cubic zinc-\nblende phase. Here we shall be concerned with the wurtzite\nphase, which is the equilibrium crystal structure when\ngrowth is on hexagonal substrates.6 It should be noted that\nthe relevant surfaces for growing wurtzite GaN are the polar\n\u00010001\u0002 and \u00010001\u00af\u0002 orientations which are inequivalent due to\ntheir different polarity. For the cation Ga \u00010001\u0002 and anion N\n\u00010001\u00af\u0002 surfaces each dangling bond is occupied with 3\/4 or\n5 \/4 electrons, respectively, as indicated in Fig. 1. Although\nepitaxial growth is possible in both directions, experiments7\nhave shown that growth on \u00010001\u0002 is generally superior to\n\u00010001\u00af\u0002 and in practice the \u00010001\u0002 GaN surface exhibits 1\n\u00011, 2\u00012, 4\u00014, 5\u00015, and 6\u00014 surface unit cells,8,9 while\nin the case of GaN \u00010001\u00af\u0002, 1\u00011, 3\u00013, 6\u00016, and c\u00016\n\u000112\u0002 structures have been seen.9,10\nOf all III-V semiconductors produced by crystal growth,\nGaN is one of the most difficult to grow in good-quality\nepitaxial form because there is no ideal substrate for such\ngrowth. Moreover, due to the extremely low chemical reac-\ntivity of N2 on GaN surfaces, growth of GaN in a nitrogen\natmosphere does not occur. External flow of nitrogen-\ncontaining reactive species is required to initiate the growth\nprocess. A common feature of all polar surfaces, independent\nof the chemical environment \u0001Ga or N rich\u0002, is a tendency to\nform Ga-rich surface stoichiometry and the N adatoms are\nthermodynamically unstable in most cases.11 This has impor-\ntant consequences for the reactivity of these surfaces. A num-\nber of studies have been made to describe the incorporation\nof Ga in the different GaN surface reconstructions in both\ncubic and wurtzite phases with adatom and adlayer\nconfigurations.12\u201314 However, there are few reports of the\nrole of N on GaN surfaces, due to the instability of these\nreconstructions.9 In view of these difficulties a better funda-\nmental understanding of the N deposition processes in GaN\ngrowth is required if higher-quality material is to be\nachieved. In addition to experimental methods, ab initio\nsimulations15 can provide accurate theoretical predictions of\nsurface geometries, electronic structure, and behavior and\nsuch an approach is the subject of this paper.\nIn this work we have studied the mechanisms governing\nthe GaN \u00010001\u0002 surface N-induced reconstruction. The GaN\n\u00010001\u00af\u0002 surface has not been investigated due to the strong\nN-N molecular bond of 9.8 eV,16 which will tend to lead to\nthe formation of N molecules on the top of the surface, in-\ndependent of the number of Ga atoms substituted. We have\nfocused our attention on the 2\u00012 surface in the N- and\nGa-rich limits in which the most stable reconstruction ob-\nserved corresponds to a N-adatom \u0001H3\u0002 structure.17 After al-\ntering the surface energetics with regards to surfactants like\narsenic, we have examined the influence of nitrogen on the\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 035327 \u00012005\u0002\n1098-0121\/2005\/72\u00013\u0002\/035327\u00017\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society035327-1\nGaN surface and compared this with the experimental results\nof nitrogen-rich GaNAs alloys.18\nII. THEORETICAL MODEL\nThe phase diagram for the adlayer model in the GaN\n\u00010001\u0002 2\u00012 reconstruction is based on density functional\ntheory \u0001DFT\u0002 calculations in combination with an appropri-\nate thermodynamic model. The DFT surface calculations car-\nried out made use of the CASTEP code19 using the generalized\ngradient approximation \u0001GGA\u0002 of Perdew and Wang\n\u0001PW91\u0002.20 The ions are described by norm-conserving, non-\nlocal atomic pseudopotentials in the Kleinman-Bylander\nform generated using the optimization scheme of Lin et al.,21\nexcept in the case of the In atom, where the ultrasoft pseudo-\npotential proposed by Vanderbilt22 has been used. The Ga 3d\nstates are included within the valence band because of the\ndemonstrable improvements in structural properties and en-\nthalpy of formation.23 Wave functions are expanded in a\nplane-wave basis set up to an energy cutoff of 800 eV and\nthe total energy is converged to better than 0.01 eV\/atom.\nIntegrations over the Brillouin zone were performed using a\n2\u00012\u00011 Monkhorst-Pack set24 sampling-point scheme for\nthe surface supercell, which gave two special k points.\nConvergence in k points and the necessary extent of the\nvacuum region above the surface were investigated as a pre-\nliminary to our main calculations where the total energy con-\nvergence with respect to k-point sampling and surface struc-\nture was checked by repeating the calculation with a larger\n4\u00014\u00011 sampling set which did not appreciably affect the\nresults. Our calculations indicated that a supercell containing\nsix GaN bilayers and a vacuum region equivalent to six GaN\nbilayers with overall approximate length of 13 \u00c5 was re-\nquired. Both the energy and structural test calculations per-\nformed show that six bilayers are sufficient to describe the\nindividual growth surface. The first four GaN bilayers are\nfixed in the appropriate bulk-optimized configuration in or-\nder to simulate the growth surface. The atoms in the two\nbilayers above the constrained layers, together with the ad-\nditional adatoms and adlayer on the surface, are allowed to\nrelax to the lowest-energy configuration commensurate with\nthe initial symmetry of the surface. The geometry of the\nsurfaces is optimized by calculating the forces using the\nHellmann-Feynmann theorem at every atom site and then\nallowing the structure to relax until all forces are reduced\nbelow a threshold of 5\u000110\u22122 eV\/\u00c5. The dangling bonds on\nthe opposite surface are saturated with H atoms to reduce the\nfinite fields that could otherwise be produced across the su-\npercell.\nThe thermodynamics formalism employed follows the\nscheme of Quian et al.25 and Northrup26 where, to study\nsurfaces having a varying number of atoms, the relative for-\nmation energies depend on the chemical potential of the ex-\ncess atomic species. We define the formation energy27 as\nEf = Etot \u2212 Eref \u2212 \u0002nGa\u0003Ga \u2212 \u0002nN\u0003N \u2212 \u0002ni\u0003i,\nwhere Etot and Eref are the total energies of the adlayer cov-\nered and reference surfaces and \u0003Ga, \u0003N, and \u0003i are the\nchemical potentials of Ga and N and the foreign chemical\nspecies \u0001Al, In, or As atoms\u0002 introduced in the adlayer. \u0002nGa,\n\u0002nN, and \u0002ni represent the differences in the number of at-\noms of each atomic species with respect to the reference\nsurface. In equilibrium the chemical potential of a given spe-\ncies is equal in all the phases that are in contact and the\nphase is in equilibrium with the GaN bulk so that \u0003Ga+\u0003N\n=\u0003GaN.\n27 In order to avoid the formation of undesirable\nphases \u0003Ga\u0004E\u0001Ga\u0005-gallium\u0002 \u0001prevents the formation of bulk\nGa\u0002, \u0003N\u0004E\u0001N2\u0002 \u0001prevents N2 molecule formation\u0002, \u0003Al\n\u0004E\u0001Alfcc\u0002 \u0001prevents the formation of bulk Al\u0002, \u0003In\n\u0004E\u0001Inbct\u0002 \u0001prevents the formation of bulk In\u0002, and \u0003As\n\u0004E\u0001AsA7\u0002 \u0001prevents the formation of bulk As\u0002. Alfcc, Inbct,\nand AsA7 represent the bulk phases of Al fcc, In bct, and As\ntrigonal A7 metallic structures, respectively.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWe first focused our attention on bulk calculations of the\ncrystalline structure and cohesive properties of GaN, and\nalso of the Al fcc, \u0005-gallium, In bct, and As trigonal A7\nmetallic structures and the N2 molecule. This was done be-\ncause the optimized GaN unit cell for the bulk will define the\nslab in the surface supercell used to build the geometrical\nFIG. 1.

The results of a full geometric structural relaxation\n\u0001atomic positions and lattice parameters\u0002 and cohesive ener-\ngies of the various bulk and N2 molecule systems are pre-\nsented in Table I. The set of results for the cell parameters\nobtained shows good agreement with experiment \u0001to within\n1%\u0002. The cohesive energies of the solids and nitrogen mol-\necule are very close to the experimental data \u0001within\n\u00030.2 eV\/atom\u0002 as are the results of similar calculations.28\nStarting from the bare GaN \u00010001\u0002 surface \u0001see Fig. 2\u0002\nand systematically adding N atoms and\/or substituting a\ncomplete N adlayer configuration by Al, Ga, In, and As, the\nequilibrium geometry and formation energy for the different\nreconstructions have been investigated. In the case of the\nGa-adlayer surface, N atoms have been replaced by Ga at-\noms on the top of the surface while in the Ga-adatom and\nN-adatom configurations only one Ga or N atom is added on\nthe top of the bare surface in order to calculate the relative\nformation energies for the most energetically favorable con-\nfiguration in comparison with the bare surface. The Ga\nchemical potential \u0002\u0003Ga=\u0003Ga\u2212\u0003Ga,bulk varies between\n\u0002\u0003Ga=0 \u0001Ga-rich conditions\u0002 and \u0002\u0003Ga=\u2212\u0002Hf =1.15 for\nGaN \u0001N-rich conditions\u0002. In general, most of the surfaces\nwith these substitutions are metallic and do not satisfy the\nelectron counting rule \u0001ECR\u0002.29\nFigure 3 shows the relative formation energies calculated\nfor 14 configurations, including the N \u0001H3\u0002 and Ga \u0001T4\u0002\nadatoms on the 2\u00012 GaN \u00010001\u0002 surface.

Our\ncalculations show that surface incorporation of N in the GaN\nadlayer is highly unfavorable, suggesting that N tends to seg-\nregate on the surface. This is because, with the introduction\nof small atoms \u0001N\u0002 over a surface with bigger atoms \u0001Ga\u0002,\nthe system prefers to break the symmetry, thus forming low-\nsymmetry configurations.30 This phenomenon has been ob-\nserved on the top of the GaN\u00010001\u0002 surface, where N atoms\nbind to other N atoms, forming trimers with almost similar\nstrengths for the N-N bonds, as shown in Fig. 4. This behav-\nior is repeated in the case of structures with three N atoms\nand one Al, Ga, In, or As atom in the adlayer configuration,\nand is independent of the kind of substituted atom. It is noted\nthat with four N atoms the bond distance between the N\natoms in the formed trimer is 1.46 \u00c5, very close to the typi-\ncal value of 1.457 \u00c5 for the N-N separation in compounds\ncontaining nitrogen and gallium.31,32 In the case of three ni-\ntrogen atoms and one Ga, Al, or In atom in the adlayer, the\nnitrogen atoms join together, forming trimers on the top of\nthe surface, Table II. The distance between the N atoms in\nthe trimer formed depends on the nature of the fourth atom.\nIn the case of group-III atoms Al, Ga, and In the N-N bond\nlength in the trimer has a consistent value of about 1.51 \u00c5\nwhile in the case of the As atoms it decreases to a value of\nTABLE II.

With only one N substitution in the 2\u00012 unit cell,\nall the Ga and N atoms remain directly above the underlying\nGa atoms. The N atoms do not move because in the 2\u00012\nconfiguration each N atom is surrounded by Al, Ga, In, and\nAs atoms, respectively, with the N atom in a restricted area,\ndirectly bonded to the underlying Ga atom. In the case of the\ngroup-III elements \u0001Al, Ga, and In\u0002 the atoms remain over\nthe underlying Ga atom with bond distances of 2.58 \u00c5 in the\ncase of Ga-Al, 2.61 \u00c5 for Ga-Ga, and 2.75 \u00c5 for Ga-In as\nshown in Table II. For the arsenic 3As1N structure, the three\nAs atoms are bonded to form an equilateral triangle with\nAs-As bond of lengths 2.49 \u00c5, in good agreement with simi-\nlar calculations.35\nIn the optimized final surface structure for the cases of the\nAl, Ga, and In adlayers, the atomic positions of the adlayer\natoms are always above the underlying Ga atoms. In the case\nof the arsenic adlayer three of the arsenic atoms form a tri-\nmer with bond lengths of 2.61 \u00c5, similar to the trimer struc-\nture shown in Fig. 4 for the N trimer. This value is somewhat\ndifferent from the 2.48 \u00c5 calculated by Ramachandran et\nal.35 This may be due to the presence of the nearby fourth As\natom affecting the trimer bond strength. The excess electron\ncharge leads to a change in the character of the surface \u0001the\nsurface with an As trimer satisfies electron counting but an\nadlayer with four As atoms does not\u0002 and their interaction\nwith the As fourth atom causes an increase in the bond dis-\ntance between the As trimer atoms.\nReturning to the calculated formation energies, we con-\nsider the 2\u00012 bare structure as a reference. Starting from the\nmost unstable structure, the N adlayer, we modified this by\nsystematically replacing all the N atoms by Al, Ga, In, and\nAs, Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002. The formation energies are shown in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002,\nwhere for purposes of comparison they are normalized to a\n1\u00011 unit cell. For the surfaces involving Ga atoms \u0001which\ncan be compared with the results of Northrup et al.14\u0002, there\nis good agreement and similary the In adlayer results are in\ngood agreement with other recent work.36 In the case of the\nGa-adlayer surface the most thermodynamically stable sur-\nface is obtained under Ga-rich conditions, which is the natu-\nral tendency in the case of GaN surfaces.37 With the Al, In,\nand As atoms the energies are independent of Ga chemical\npotential because the stoichiometry of these surfaces differs\nfrom the bare surface by the addition of four atoms of Al, In,\nor As alone. The Al-adlayer structure is stable by 0.07 eV\ncompared to the clean surface, which is one explanation for\nthe poor quality of growth in the first layer in the epitaxy of\nAl films over clean GaN \u00010001\u0002 surfaces reported by Liu et\nFIG. 5.

In principle it should be the case\nthat structures with N in the adlayer configuration should be\nenergetically highly unfavorable over the complete range of\nallowed chemical potentials. According to the graph, there is\na tendency for the surface to be unstable as the number of N\natoms increases except in the case of the 3N1In structure\nunder N-rich conditions. All the other structures with N are\nunstable, independent of the kind of atom in the adlayer, and\nno surfactant behavior is observed. In the case of 3As1N\nunder N-rich conditions the structure is close to being stable,\nbut this difference is not considered significant because the\nenergy difference is similar to the numerical errors in our\ncalculations.\nFrom the phase diagram and the relations between the\ndifferent structures a number of conclusions may be drawn.\nUsing the results obtained for the energetically more stable\nsurfaces according to Fig. 3, Fig. 5 shows the phase diagrams\nas a function of a given Al, Ga, In, and As set of chemical\npotentials for the different reconstructions. Surfaces with\nhigher energies have not been considered due to their insta-\nbility.\nIn the case of Al substitutions, to which Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002 refers,\nthe incorporation of Al atoms is energetically less stable than\nthe N- and Ga-adatom and Ga-adlayer models over the entire\nrange of the Ga chemical potential independent of the Al\nconcentration. This result may explain the low Al surface\nmobility with respect to Ga in growth over \u00010001\u0002 planes39\nand in the difficulty in growing good-quality Al films on\nGaN.38\nAlso, independent of the Al concentration and going from\nGa- to N-rich conditions, the phase diagram reproduces the\npreviously predicted surface structures \u0001Ga monolayer, Ga\nadatom, and N adatom\u0002 for clean GaN surfaces with no im-\npurities on the surface. For In substitutions, Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002, the\ndiagram is consistent with previous calculations made by\nNeugebauer et al.37 It is notable that under N-rich conditions\nthe adlayer surface corresponding to 3N1In is stable with\nrespect to the clean surface but it does not appear in the\nphase diagram because it is less stable than the N-adatom,\nGa-adatom, or Ga-adlayer surfaces depending on the value\nof chemical potential. Only if we go beyond the allowed\nrange of the chemical potential would it appear. Thus we\nwould not expect to observe this surface in practice.\nFigure 5\u0001c\u0002 shows the results for As substitutions. Under\nAs-rich conditions, a stable phase is found, which is in\nagreement with experiment and previous theoretical\nresults,35 and under As-poor conditions the behavior is simi-\nlar to the clean GaN \u00010001\u0002 surface. The As-adlayer configu-\nration has a lower surface energy than that of the Ga adlayer,\nconsistent with the slightly larger cohesive energy of bulk As\n\u00012.86 eV\/atom\u0002 compared to that of Ga \u00012.81 eV\/atom\u0002.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, using first-principles methods we have stud-\nied the structure and stability of the adlayer 2\u00012 model of\nthe GaN \u00010001\u0002 surface with foreign or impurity-covered at-\noms. The top layer was either entirely Al, Ga, In, or As or\ncontained a variable number of N atoms. In the case of a\nsurface completely covered by In or As atoms, a surfactant\neffect of these atoms has been observed. For most of the\nsurfaces, independent of the number of N substitutions in the\ntop layer under Ga- and N-rich conditions, the surfaces are\nunstable relative to the bare Ga-terminated surface. However,\nwe have found an N-substituted configuration containing\nthree N atoms and one In atom with a lower energy than the\nbare surface configuration.\nWe have constructed phase diagrams for the GaN \u00010001\u0002\nsurface exposed to Al, In, and As, which shows the condition\nrequired for the existence of different phases and the rela-\ntionship between the different reconstructions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are grateful to the EPSRC \u0001Grant No. GR\/\nR25859\/01\u0002 for providing funding for this work.\n1 Properties of Advanced Semiconductor Materials: GaN, AlN,\nInN, BN, and SiGe, edited by M.
