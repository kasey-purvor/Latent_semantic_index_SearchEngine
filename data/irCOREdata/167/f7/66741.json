There are a number\nof aspects to this problem which include an understand-\ning of bond behaviour, an understanding of cracking\nbehaviour and the related problem of tension stiffening.\nAny study of the literature will show that these are\ninterrelated. Although much research has been carried\nMagazine of Concrete Research, 2005, 57, No. 10, December, 611\u2013621\n611\n0024-9831# 2005 Thomas Telford Ltd\n* School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds, UK.\n\u2020 School of Engineering, University of Durham, UK.\n(MCR 41284) Paper received 26 May 2004; last revised 8 February\n2005; accepted 22 June 2005\nout into these problems, issues that require resolution\nstill remain.\nTraditionally, it is assumed in the design of rein-\nforced concrete that concrete has no tensile strength.\nOn this assumption, and assuming elastic behaviour of\nthe steel and the concrete in compression, it is possible\nto calculate the stresses and strains in the concrete and\nthe reinforcement and hence the deformations of the\nmember. In practice, it is found that this procedure\noverestimates the deformations because the concrete in\ntension surrounding the reinforcement does, on aver-\nage, carry some stress, even after cracking. This reduc-\ntion in deformation or increase in stiffness relative to\nthat calculated assuming the concrete supports no ten-\nsion is referred to as tension stiffening.\nRecently, two linked Engineering and Physical Re-\nsearch Council (EPSRC) grants were awarded: one to\nthe University of Durham and the other to the Univer-\nsity of Leeds to investigate tension stiffening and, in\nparticular, the reduction in tension stiffening with time.\nIn addition to the grants from the EPSRC, industrial\ncontributions to the project, both financial and in-kind,\nwere made by Arup Research and Development, Gif-\nfords, Cadogan Tietz and the Concrete Society.\nThe experimental work carried out under these grants\nhas enabled a very thorough study to be carried out into\nthe behaviour of concrete in tension surrounding rein-\nforcement. In this paper, the results from the experi-\nmental work will be used to explore the behaviour of\ntension zones under service levels of short-term load-\ning. It is believed that this work has led to a much\nclearer idea to be developed of the nature of the inter-\nactions between steel and concrete. Details of the test-\ning and instrumentation and some results from this\nproject have been published elsewhere1\u20134 so these will\nnot be described in detail in this paper. A future paper\nwill deal with the detail of tension stiffening behaviour\nover time.\nBasic behaviour of tension elements\nBefore attempting to develop further the theory of\nthe behaviour of members subjected to pure tension it\nwould be useful to gain a picture of the behaviour of\nsuch members. This will be done by looking at test data\nfrom tension tests carried out by Scott and Gill.5\nA procedure for fixing strain gauges at very close\nspacings along the length of reinforcing bars has been\ndeveloped at the University of Durham. This has been\nused over a period of some 20 years in a large number\nof projects in which detailed measurements of the var-\niations of strain or stress along the reinforcement are\nnecessary. This procedure has been described in detail.5\nScott and Gill\u2019s tests on specimens with deformed bars\nare detailed in Table 1.\nInitially, strain data for specimen 100T12 will be\npresented as this gives a convenient illustration of a\nnumber of aspects of behaviour. Data from other speci-\nmens will be considered later to illustrate particular\npoints. Fig. 1 shows the load\u2013average reinforcement\nstrain response for this specimen.\nIt will be seen that the response is not a continuous\nsmooth curve as is commonly plotted, but is made up\nof a series of linear segments separated by a sudden\nincrease in strain on the occurrence of each crack. Up\nto a load of about 35 kN, these linear segments, extra-\npolated backwards, can be seen to pass through the\norigin. The behaviour of the tension specimen with a\ngiven number of cracks is thus elastic. Using the com-\nputer to produce \u2018best fit\u2019 lines for each segment\nenables the stiffness of the specimen to be established\nfor each crack configuration. Fig. 2 shows this stiffness\nplotted against the number of cracks. It will be seen\nthat there is a linear relationship between stiffness and\nTable 1.

This implies that the formation of\neach crack reduces the stiffness of the element by a\nconstant amount. The final point for four cracks does\nnot quite fit the linear relationship. This point is ob-\ntained from the behaviour immediately after formation\nof the fourth crack. Fig. 1 shows that at higher loads\nthere are two further sudden increases in strain. These\nincreases were not related to the formation of visible\nsurface cracks and it may be speculated that they arise\nfrom some form of internal failure. It should be noted\nthat both events occurred only at very high levels of\nstress in the reinforcement (. 400 N\/mm2).\nA further point to note from Scott and Gill\u2019s tests is\nthat the variation in steel strain on either side of a crack\nis close to linear. A typical result is shown in Fig. 3,\nwhich shows the variation in steel strain between two\ncracks at two levels of load in specimen 100T20. This\nclose approximation to a linear strain variation is typi-\ncal of all specimens in work by Scott and Gill5, Beeby\nand Scott1 and in other research programmes in which\nthe Durham system of instrumenting bars has been\nused. This linear variation of stress implies a constant\nbond stress, which initially suggests some form of\nplastic behaviour. In fact, this is not the case\u2014as can\nbe seen from Fig. 4. This figure shows the bond stres-\nses, calculated from the average change in stress over\nthe transfer length, So, for specimen 100T20. It will be\nseen that there is an almost linear increase in bond\nstress with increase in applied axial force up to an axial\nforce of approximately 30 kN or a bond stress of about\n4 N\/mm2. Above this, the rate of increase in bond\nstress with increase in load reduces substantially to\nclose to zero. Other specimens behave similarly,\nalthough the change from the linear response occurs at\ndifferent loading states. For example, the change from\nthe linear for specimen 140T20 is at a bond stress of\nclose to 6 N\/mm2 and an axial force of approximately\n65 kN. From the limited data available, however, it\nseems likely that the kink in the response is not related\nto any intrinsic property of bond.\nDerivation of equations for short-term\nloading\nThe results from Scott and Gill\u2019s tests have provided\nthe following information on the behaviour of axially\nreinforced tension prisms.\n(a) The formation of a crack results in a reduction in\nthe stiffness of the element. For a particular ele-\nment, the reduction in stiffness caused by the for-\nmation of a crack is close to constant.\n(b) The load\u2013deformation response during load incre-\nments between the formation of one crack and the\nformation of the next crack is linear. Extrapolation\nof the straight-line relationship back to the axes\nshows that the lines pass very close to the origin,\nsuggesting that the behaviour is effectively elastic.\n(c) The distribution of the stresses in the reinforce-\nment and the concrete over the length So on either\nside of a crack closely approximates to linearity.\nThese findings may be used to develop equations for\nthe prediction of both the deformation and the crack\nwidth in axially reinforced prisms subjected to tension.\nFigure 5 shows a schematic picture of the variation\nof strain in the region of a crack.

This extension is given by\nExtension \u00bc \u02dca \u00fe n\u02dcb\nand hence the average strain is given by\n\u0002sm \u00bc \u0002s2(\u00c6er\u00fe 2\u0001Son=L)=(1\u00fe \u00c6er)\nAs it appears that the variation in stress in the reinfor-\ncement and concrete is linear over the length So, it can\nbe assumed that \u0001 \u00bc 0.5, giving\n\u0002sm \u00bc \u0002s2(\u00c6er\u00fe Son=L)=(1\u00fe \u00c6er) (5)\nEquation (5) can be seen to have exactly the same form\nas the line in Fig. 2. Since the crack spacing, S, can be\nexpressed as L\/(n + 1), n\/L can be more conveniently\nexpressed in terms of S, if desired.\nThese equations only apply rigorously in situations\nwhere the average crack spacing is greater than 2So. It\nis possible to derive similar equations for situations\nwhere the spacing is less than 2So. In this case, the\nstress in the reinforcement mid-way between cracks\ndoes not reduce to \u0002s2\u00c6er\/(1 + \u00c6er) but, if the bond\nstress is assumed to remain constant, the resulting\nequation is\n\u0002sm \u00bc \u0002s2[1\u00fe \u00c6er\u0001 Srm=(4So)]=(1\u00fe \u00c6er) (6)\nA recent paper by Beeby and Scott2 develops and tests\nequations (5) and (6) in detail. A formula is developed\nfor the prediction of the crack spacing, S, which is\nneeded in equations (5) and (6). Using this, it is shown\nthat equation (5) predicts the deformation of a tension\nprism with considerable precision in cases where the\nspacing is greater than So. This is a larger range of\napplicability than is theoretically correct but, practi-\ncally, a very useful conclusion.\nThe basic model developed from the test data can\nalso be used to establish the expected crack width.\nThe extension of the reinforcement in the region of\nthe crack, provided the crack spacing exceeds 2So, is\n\u02dcb, given by equation (4) above. This is not quite the\ncomplete crack width since, as well as an extension of\nthe reinforcement, there is a contraction of the concrete\nin the region of the crack since the stress in the con-\ncrete has been reduced. The stress in the concrete at\nthe end of the length So is given by\n\u0003ct \u00bc \u0002s2AsEs=Ac(1\u00fe \u00c6er) \u00bc \u0002s2rEs=(1\u00fe \u00c6er)\nFrom this, the increment in crack width caused by\nchange in length of the concrete can be written as\n\u02dcc \u00bc 2So\u0001\u00c6er\u0002s2=(1\u00fe \u00c6er)\nThe total crack width is now given by\nw \u00bc \u02dcb \u00fe \u02dcc \u00bc 2So\u0001\u0002s2(1\u00fe \u00c6er)=(1\u00fe \u00c6er) \u00bc 2So\u0001\u0002s2\nIf, as before, it is assumed that \u0001 \u00bc 0.5 then\nw \u00bc So\u0002s2 (7)\n\u0002s2 can be obtained directly from equation (2).\nOne point should be noted about this equation. Since\nit is assumed that the cracks are more than 2So apart,\nall cracks will depend on the deformations of the re-\ninforcement and concrete over the full 2So. All the\ncracks on the element will therefore be predicted to be\nthe same width. In practice, this is clearly unlikely to\nbe true and there will inevitably be a variability owing\nto the inherent variability in material properties from\nsection to section along the member. This is likely to\nappear as a random variability in So along the element.\nA different formula would be expected to apply when\nthe average spacing became less than 2So and this can\neasily be derived as\n*\u000b\f\u0015\u001b\n\u0001\u0014\n\u0001\u0014\n\u0001\u0014\n\u0001\u000f\u0003\n\u0001\u0014 \u0001\u0014\n\u001f\f!\u000e)\u0010\u000b\f\u0011\u0012\u000e#\n\u0013\u0014\u000b\n\n\u0002\u000f\u0010\u000e\u0015\u000b\f\u0015\u001b\n\u001f#!\u000e)\u0010\u000b\f\u0011\u0012\u000e\u0011\u0012\n\u000b\n\u0011\u0012\u0013\u0014\u000b\u0015\n\u0016\n\u0012\u0010\u000e\f\u0010\n\u0002\u000f\u0010\u000e\u0015\u000b\f\u0015\u001b\n\u001f\u0015!\u000e)\u0010\u000b\f\u0011\u0012\u000e\u0011\u0012\n\u0015\u0014\u0012\u0015\u000b\n\u0010\n\u000e\f\u0010\u000e\u0002\u000f\u0010\n\u0015\u000b\f\u0015\u001b\nFig. 5. Strain conditions in the region of the first crack\nA. W. Beeby and R. H. Scott\n614 Magazine of Concrete Research, 2005, 57, No. 10\nwav \u00bc Srm\u0002s2(1\u0001 Srm=4So) (8)\nThis equation gives an average crack width as a\nfunction of the average crack spacing. It can be argued\nthat the maximum crack width will still be given by\nequation (7) since the maximum width will correspond\nto the situation where the crack spacing on either side\nof the crack is just 2So. Furthermore, equation (8) is\ndifficult to apply. It requires calculation of the crack\nspacing under any particular loading. An equation for\nthis has been presented2 but this, in turn, depends upon\nthe average strain. In practice, therefore, it may be\nappropriate to ignore equation (8) and use equation (7)\nfor all situations. Equation (8) will therefore not be\nconsidered further in this paper.\nA set of equations has now been derived for both the\ndeformation and the crack widths in reinforced con-\ncrete prisms derived from the same model of behaviour\nof tension zones. This seems to be a valuable step in\nthe development of rational equations for the prediction\nof serviceability behaviour. The remaining variable that\nneeds to be established in order to produce a complete\nset of formulae for deflections and crack widths in\ntension members is the distance, So, over which the\nstresses are affected by a crack\nDevelopment of an expression for So\nThere are a number of ways by which values of So\ncan be obtained from the available test data. The most\nobvious is that, where the distribution of strain or stress\nin the reinforcing bars has been measured, then So can\nbe obtained directly from the distribution. This requires\nsome care and is really only possible at early load\nstages before the cracks are sufficiently closely spaced\nto interfere with each other. Nevertheless, values of So\nhave been obtained directly for most of Scott and Gill\u2019s\nspecimens reinforced with deformed bars.\nThe second approach is to use the equation for defor-\nmations derived earlier (equation (5)). This can be re-\narranged to give\nSo \u00bc [\u0002sm=\u0002s2(1\u00fe \u00c6er)\u0001 \u00c6er]L=n\nConsidering Fig. 1, it will be seen that \u0002sm\/\u0002s2 is the\ngradient of the line drawn through the data points\ncorresponding to a particular number of cracks. All\nother variables in the equation are known and hence So\ncan be obtained. This has been done for all the square-\nsectioned prisms tested by Scott and Gill5 and also a\nselection of the results obtained by Farra and Jaccoud.6\nFarra and Jaccoud tested a series of more than 130\nprisms, all of which had a 100 mm square cross-section\nand were reinforced with either a 10, 14 or 20 mm\naxially placed bar. The main variable considered was\nthe concrete mix, and a wide range of concrete\nstrengths and cement types were used. For each mix\nand bar size, a set of three nominally identical speci-\nmens were cast and tested. For the purposes of this\nexercise, it seemed excessively time consuming to cal-\nculate So for all the specimens and so only a few\ndeterminations have been made for typical specimens\nfor each bar diameter and a range of concrete strengths.\nSince So is predicted to vary largely as a function of\ngeometric variables, carrying out determinations of So\nfor a much greater number of specimens would simply\nhave given a better picture of the scatter of results. The\nscatter can be investigated with much less effort when\nthe crack width predicted by equation (7) is evaluated\nfor a much larger population of Farra and Jaccoud\u2019s\nspecimens in the next section of the report. Farra and\nJaccoud tested their specimens using increments in\nstrain rather than increments in load since they were\nprimarily interested in cracking caused by restraint.\nThey present detailed graphs and tables of stresses,\nstrains and crack widths for all load stages for all\nspecimens. In general, only one determination has been\nmade for each specimen for the case where n \u00bc 1. This\nwas difficult to do for specimens with low concrete\nstrengths and the highest reinforcement ratio because\nonly one or two strain readings were taken for these\nspecimens when just one crack was present. To enable\na result to be obtained in this case, the stiffnesses were\ncalculated for the situations in which there were one,\ntwo and three cracks and the resulting assessment of So\naveraged.\nFinally, Farra and Jaccoud measured extensive crack\nwidth data and this can be used to establish So directly\nfrom equation (7). Fig. 6 shows the average crack\nwidths measured by Farra and Jaccoud for a series of\nthree specimens reinforced with a 14 mm bar plotted\nagainst the strain in the reinforcement at a crack\n(\u0003s2\/Es). A good linear relationship is obtained between\ncrack width and steel strain and, according to equation\n(7), the gradient of this line is So. This approach has\nbeen used to establish So for the same specimens as\nhad been used previously.\nThe values of So found by the three methods de-\nscribed above have been tabulated in Table 2.

Nevertheless,\nagreement between the methods is sufficiently good to\ngive reasonable confidence that each method is measur-\ning the same thing. It now remains to establish the\nfactors that influence So. The most well-established\ntheory for the prediction of cracking predicts that So\nwill be proportional to \u0005\/r. In a recent paper7 Beeby\nshowed, from an analysis of extensive cracking data\nfrom many sources, that \u0005\/r has no discernable influ-\nence on cracking, and hence on So. It is shown that the\ncritical parameter is the cover, c. This confirms the\nconclusions of earlier work in the UK8 and USA.9\nThus, So is plotted against cover in Fig. 7, which shows\nthat a reasonable expression for So is:\nSo \u00bc 3:05c (9)\nwhere c is the cover.\nValidation of the equations\nThe validation of equations (1) and (2) has been\ncovered fully2 and will not be considered in detail here.\nIt has been shown3 that equation (1) will predict the\naverage stress in the concrete in cracked prisms tested\nby Farra and Jaccoud6 with a mean error of 0.08 N\/\nmm2 and a standard deviation of 0.29 N\/mm2. This\nprediction is considerably superior to other formulae\nconsidered. This paper focuses on consideration of the\ncrack width prediction equations (equations (7) and\n(8)).\nFigure 8 compares the calculated crack widths given\nby equation (7) with the experimental average crack\nwidths obtained by Ramos and Serre.10 Generally,\nagreement is very good. The slight tendency for equa-\ntion (7) to overestimate the crack width may arise from\nthe comparison of the predictions with the average\ncrack widths rather than the maximum values, which\nwere not reported. Ramos and Serre\u2019s data cover a wide\nvariation in covers and bar diameters, but little varia-\ntion in reinforcement ratio.\nFigure 9 shows similar comparisons using data pro-\nduced by Haqqi.11 Haqqi tested larger tension speci-\nmens with multiple reinforcing bars with the objective\nof modelling more practical situations. The data used\nare for crack widths measured on the surface perpendi-\ncularly away from a reinforcing bar. The data cover a\nwide range of covers, reinforcement ratios and bar\ndiameters. Agreement is not as good as that achieved\nwith the data from Ramos and Serre, but it is still\nreasonable. The differences may result from the more\nTable 2.

Some care\nneeds to be taken with the selection of results from\nFarra and Jaccoud. Their tests were carried out by\nincrementing the strain rather than increasing the load,\nas was done with all the other data considered. The\neffect of this difference in test procedure is that, when\na crack forms, the stiffness of the prism is reduced and\nthe loads, stresses and crack widths reduce. Data have\nbeen selected which, as closely as possible, correspond\nto the maximum crack widths just before formation of\na further crack. Furthermore, the major variable consid-\nered was the concrete mix design. It was found when\nusing these tests to validate the equations for the pre-\ndiction of the deformations that the crack formation\nvaried quite considerably with variations in cement\ntype. The reason for this variability is unclear, although\nit has been suggested2 that it might be the result of\nchanges in the coefficient of variation of the concrete\ntensile strength. As a result of this problem, crack\nwidths have been used for only one cement type: Port-\nland cement without the addition of silica fume. Fig.\n10 shows that, using this limited set of data, good\nagreement is obtained between calculated and experi-\nmental crack widths. Including all the cements used\nsignificantly increases the scatter.\nTo gain an overall picture of the accuracy of the\nproposed formula, the data from the three sets of tests\nconsidered above have been combined. This gives 280\nindividual results. The average value of the ratio of the\nexperimental crack width to the calculated width is\n1.10 and the standard deviation of the ratio is 0.23. The\nresults from Farra and Jaccoud6 and Haqqi11 have also\nbeen compared with widths calculated using the equa-\ntion in the Comite\u00b4 Euro-International du Be\u00b4ton (CEB)\nmodel code.12 In applying this formula, the value of\n(\u0002sm \u0001 \u0002cm \u0001 \u0002cs) has been taken as the measured aver-\nage strain. The 36 results from Ramos and Serre10 have\nnot been used in this comparison because the average\nstrain was not reported. The results from 244 compari-\nsons of the CEB calculation with the experimental\nvalues gives an average ratio of the experimental crack\nwidth to the calculated width of 0.81 and the standard\ndeviation of the ratio of 0.49, more than twice the value\nobtained for the proposed formula.\nOverall, the comparisons carried out and presented\nin this section suggest that equation (7) gives a good\nestimate of the crack width in tension members, which\nare either centrally reinforced prisms or where the\ncrack widths are measured directly over the bars. A\nprevious paper by the current authors2 shows that equa-\ntion (4) predicts the deformation well. The basic ap-\nproach to the prediction of the behaviour of tension\nmembers thus seems justified.\nMechanisms to accommodate high strains\nin reinforcement\nA full understanding of the behaviour of concrete in\ntension around reinforcing bars requires that the me-\nchanisms for accommodating strains in the reinforce-\nment, which are substantially greater than the ultimate\ntensile strain of the concrete, are understood. Fig. 11\nillustrates the issue. This shows the reinforcement\nstrains at four stages during the loading of specimen\nT16B1.1 It will be seen that at every stage above 8 kN,\nthere is a major area adjacent to a crack or a free end\nof the specimen where the strain substantially exceeds\nthe strain capacity of the concrete (assuming this to be\nin the region of 100 \u0001 150 3 10\u00016).

Variation in reinforcement strain along the length of\nspecimen T16B11 at various levels of axial load\nAxially reinforced members subjected to pure tension\nMagazine of Concrete Research, 2005, 57, No. 10 617\nof the concrete at all points along the specimen.\nClearly, some mechanism must exist to accommodate\nthis strain incompatibility.\nTwo mechanisms have been proposed. The first is\nbond\u2013slip. This seems a rational assumption when the\nbars are smooth, but less so for ribbed bars. Neverthe-\nless, this assumption of bond failure followed by slip\nbetween the bar and the concrete has remained the\nmost commonly invoked concept and one which lies at\nthe root of many models of behaviour. In particular, it\nlies at the root of most derivations of formulae for the\nprediction of crack widths and is enshrined in the CEB\nmodel code.12 The alternative mechanism is internal\ncracking of the form demonstrated by Goto.13 The two\nmechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 12. In the slip me-\nchanism, a relationship has to be postulated between\nthe slip at any point along the bar and the bond stress.\nMany forms of bond\u2013slip relationship have been pro-\nposed. The CEB\/FIP model code 9012 provides what\nmust be the closest to a \u2018consensus\u2019 view on bond\u2013slip\nrelationships and, for the low levels of slip obtaining\nunder service conditions, this is given by the relation-\nship:\n\u0004 \u00bc \u0004max(s=s1)\u00c6 (10)\nIn the model code, \u0004max is taken as 2\u02c7fc, s1 as 0.6 mm\nand \u00c6 as 0.4 for the conditions appropriate to the\ntension tests.\nMost classical derivations of crack width formulae\nassume that bond failure occurs and that the average\nbond stress can be uniquely related to the ultimate bond\nstrength, independently of the amount of slip. These\nmethods might be considered to assume a constant\nbond stress.\nIn the internal cracking model, the deformation of\nthe bar is accommodated by the deformation of the\nteeth between the internal cracks. These teeth are in\nreality cones of concrete caused by the axi-symmetric\nnature of the bar and the surrounding concrete. No real\nattempt has been made to analyse this situation in the\ncontext of the development of crack prediction formu-\nlae. However, this mechanism has been invoked in the\ndevelopment of bond failure theories (e.g. see\nTepfers14). A possible approach might reasonably be to\nconsider the cones as conical springs. By analogy with\nthe deformation of circular plates, the deformation at\nthe inner edge of the cones could be expected to be\nproportional to the load applied by the interaction be-\ntween the concrete and the rib. An attempt must be\nmade to establish which of these mechanisms is most\nconsistent with the behaviour revealed by the tests.\nClassical theories generally implicitly assume that\nthe crack width is simply the sum of the slip on either\nside of the crack and that the width is constant between\nthe bar and the concrete surface. A considerable num-\nber of studies have been carried out to investigate this\nand the resulting information on the shape of cracks\nhas been considered in some detail1 and has been\nsummarised by Farra and Jaccoud.6 These studies\nclearly show that the deformation of the crack faces is\nmore consistent with the internal cracking model than\nwith a bond\u2013slip model. Also, the problem with the\nbond\u2013slip model is the necessity for the concrete to be\nable to slip past the ribs on the bar. If this occurs, there\nshould be clear and widespread evidence of disruption\nof the concrete around the ribs. Inspection of the con-\ncrete interface revealed that, after breaking the concrete\noff, the bar rarely shows any sign of this at the level of\nload relevant to serviceability considerations.\nThe difference between the two mechanisms may not\nbe too revolutionary: bond stress is simply a shear\nstress at the interface between the steel and concrete.\nFailure could either occur by failure along the interface\nor as cracks in the concrete which form under action of\nthe principal tensile stress.13 This would be expected to\nbe at some angle to the axis of the bar. In other forms\nof reinforced concrete behaviour, such as punching\nshear, it is clearly the diagonal cracking which occurs\nrather than a vertical failure along the slab\u2013column\ninterface.\nIt may help further discussion to set down some\nexperimental results which will show what a viable\nmodel needs to be able to predict. The experimental\nresults show the following.\n(a) The variation in the stress in the reinforcement\nover the length So is close to linear. This implies a\nconstant bond stress over this length.\n(b) There is little evidence of general slip.\n(c) The bond stress increases with increasing load.\n(d ) Equations (5) and (7) appear to predict behaviour\nwell and have been derived on the assumption of\nelastic behaviour punctuated by discrete cracking\nevents.\n(e) It has been shown by Beeby7 and in the present\npaper that So and crack widths are proportional to\ncover and independent of \u0005 or r.\nThe bond\u2013slip model can now be considered to see\nhow well it fits these requirements.

Mechanisms for accommodating the strain incom-\npatibility between the reinforcing bar and the concrete\nA. W. Beeby and R. H. Scott\n618 Magazine of Concrete Research, 2005, 57, No. 10\nfor cracking has been developed for an internal crack-\ning mechanism so a study will have to be initiated to\nestablish whether such a model could, potentially incor-\nporate these requirements.\nThere are, in fact, two mutually incompatible bond\u2013\nslip models. The classical model, on which the CEB\nmodel code crack formula is based, assumes that bond\nfailure has taken place at some point along So and so\nthe average bond stress can be related directly to the\nultimate bond strength. It is not essential to assume a\nuniform bond stress along the length So, although this\nis often done. Since the bond stress has reached its\nultimate value, however, there can be no further in-\ncrease in bond stress with increase in load. This vio-\nlates point (c) above. Point (d ) is also probably violated\nand the lack of evidence for bond failure and slip at the\nbar\u2013concrete interface also counts against this model.\nFinally, the model predicts that cracking will be a func-\ntion of \u0005\/r, which has been shown to be untrue.7\nThe second bond\u2013slip model is to assume a bond\u2013\nslip relationship obtained from tests such as the CEB\nrelationship given by equation (10). This is incompati-\nble with the model used for the CEB crack prediction\nformula because bond failure is not predicted to occur\nuntil a slip of 0.6 mm, corresponding to a crack width\nat the bar surface of 1.2 mm and a width at the concrete\nsurface of possibly 2 mm or more. In the range of slips\nappropriate to serviceability behaviour, the bond stress\nis predicted to increase with increasing load. This mod-\nel could therefore satisfy requirements (b), (c) and (d )\nabove. There are, however, difficulties with requirement\n(a). Any slip model requires that there is zero slip at\nthe end of So remote from the crack and then increases\nup to about half the crack width at the crack face. The\nbond\u2013slip model would thus require that the bond\nstress increased from zero at the end of So remote from\nthe crack and reached a maximum at the crack. This\ncontradicts the clear experimental evidence of a more-\nor-less constant bond stress over the whole of So.\nBond\u2013slip models thus appear unable to explain the\nactual behaviour, and a viable model must be found\nelsewhere.\nDevelopment of an internal cracking\nmodel\nThe problem which needs to be addressed is to\nformulate a model in which the transfer of stress be-\ntween the reinforcing bar and the concrete can be pre-\ndicted, allowing for the presence of internal cracks.\nThe model selected is that of a bar restrained by com-\npression springs at intervals along the bar. This is illu-\nstrated in Fig. 13. Each pair of springs models the\nstiffness of a compression strut in the concrete between\ntwo internal cracks. These compression struts are actu-\nally akin to conical springs, bearing in mind the axial\nsymmetry of the system. The chain dotted line to the\nright of Fig. 13 indicates either the point at which there\nis zero stress in the bar or the section mid-way between\ncracks where, by symmetry, there is no horizontal\nmovement of the bar. If stiffnesses are ascribed to the\nsprings and the bar and the distance \u02dcL is defined, then\nthe variation of stress along the bar can easily be\ncalculated.\nInspection of standard textbooks on elasticity shows\nthat the deformation at the centre of a circular plate,\nregardless of the boundary conditions, can be expressed\nby the relation:\n\u0006 \u00bc kN (1\u0001 \u00072)R2=(Et3)\nwhere \u0006 \u00bc the deflection at the centre\nk \u00bc a constant depending on the boundary condi-\ntions and form of the loading\nN \u00bc the applied load\nR \u00bc the radius of the plate\nE \u00bc the modulus of elasticity of the material\nt \u00bc the plate thickness\n\u0007 \u00bc Poisson\u2019s ratio.\nFor a given configuration of conical spring and a\ngiven material, k, t, E and \u0007 will be constants so that\nthe equation reduces to:\n\u0006 i \u00bc k9NiR2i or k9=R2i \u00bc Ni=\u0006i (11)\nwhere the subscript \u2018i\u2019 indicates the ith tooth.\nIf a linear variation in steel stress is to be modelled\nthen, for a given overall axial load, the load Ni carried\nby each tooth should be constant along the length So. If\nthe model is to give a linear increase in stress in the\nreinforcement with distance from the end of So remote\nfrom a crack, the displacement of the tooth, \u0006i, at the\nbar surface can be written as:\n\u0006 i \u00bc \u0003 sx=2Es\nbut \u0003s \u00bc kx and hence \u0006 i \u00bc kx2\/2Es\nSubstituting for \u0006 in equation (11) and rearranging\ngives:\nRi \u00bc k9x=p(2EsNi) (12)\nThus, the model suggests that, for a linear change in\n)\u0010\u0011\u0013\u0013\u0012\n\u000f\u000f\u000e\u0001\u0004\n)\u0010\u0011\u0013\u0013\u0012\n\u000f\u000f\u000e\u0001\u0003\n)\u0010\u0011\u0013\u0013\u0012\n\u000f\u000f\u000e\u0001\u0002\n\u0002\u0003 \u0002\u0003 \u0002\u0003\nFig. 13. Schematic diagram of proposed bar\u2013concrete inter-\naction\nAxially reinforced members subjected to pure tension\nMagazine of Concrete Research, 2005, 57, No. 10 619\nsteel strain or stress, the height of the cracks, Ri should\nbe proportional to distance from the end of So remote\nfrom the crack, x. There is some experimental evidence\nto support this. Fig. 14 shows the internal cracks\naround bars anchored in blocks of concrete and then\npulled. The figure is drawn from a photograph in a\npaper by Otsuka and Ozaka.15 The figure shows a\nmore-or-less linear decrease in crack length with in-\ncreasing distance from the face of the concrete.\nThe possibility of change in length of the cracks with\nincrease in load on the prisms has not yet been consid-\nered. Intuitively, the crack length and hence the stiff-\nness of the interface could be expected to decrease with\nincrease in loading as the deformation of each tooth\nmust increase with increase in load. The model can be\nstudied to establish what might happen. If it is assumed\nthat bond is entirely elastic and that the bond stress\nincreases linearly with increase in applied load, then\nthe internal cracking would have to develop immedi-\nately on formation of the crack and would then have to\nstay constant. If, on the other hand, it was assumed that\nthe bond stress remained constant with increase in\nloading, then equation (11) suggests that R at any point\nalong So should vary proportionally to the square root\nof the load applied to the bar at a crack. The test results\nsuggest that, at low levels of loading above the cracking\nload, the bond is elastic while at higher loads, the bond\nstress tends to approach a constant value. This suggests\nthat the internal crack pattern forms immediately on\nformation of the crack and that the length of these\ncracks remains sensibly constant for some considerable\nincrease in loading. Beyond a certain point, however,\nthe lengths of the internal cracks start to increase. At\nhigh loads, the rate of increase approaches proportion-\nality with the square root of the applied load. The\neffectiveness of the equations derived earlier for crack\nwidth and deformation, which assume elastic bond,\nshows that, in practice, the assumption of elastic bond\nappears practically reasonable.\nDiscussion\nThe object of this brief discussion is simply to clarify\nwhat the work reported in this paper claims to have\nachieved. The study has been concerned almost entirely\nwith the behaviour of axially reinforced prisms. Such\nelements have been used frequently in the past as the\nbasis for deriving formulae for the prediction of crack-\ning and the results from prisms have been assumed to\napply to any other tension zone; comparative behaviour\nbeing obtained simply by the empirical definition of an\nappropriate effective area of concrete surrounding the\nbar. It is not intended to claim that this can necessarily\nbe done with the results reported here and it is not\nclaimed that the formulae can reliably be applied at\npresent to any elements other than axially reinforced\nprisms, although further work may enable a more gen-\neral application. Particular issues which remain to be\nconsidered are (a) the effect of multiple bars and hence\nthe influence of bar spacing and (b) the rather different\nstress conditions which occur in members subjected to\nbending where there is a strain gradient across the\ntension zone.\nWhat is claimed is that the research has shed much\nlight on the actual behaviour of tension zones under\nconditions where this can be established unambigu-\nously. In the present authors\u2019 view, the behavioural\nmechanisms revealed or postulated are likely to hold\ngenerally true in all cracked tension zones, although\nthere may be further mechanisms acting in more com-\nplex situations. While these further mechanisms may\ncomplicate the situation, the present authors believe\nthat the fundamental mechanisms will remain valid.\nThe equations derived for the prediction of crack\nwidths and deformations perform a useful purpose in\nthat they enable the reasonableness of the proposed\nmechanism to be tested for this simple experimental\narrangement. The results of this testing have been\nhighly satisfactory. The current authors are therefore\nreasonably confident that the basic aspects of the be-\nhaviour of reinforced tension zones have been correctly\nidentified. Further work will, however, be required to\ndevelop generally applicable practical formulae. The\nformulae derived in this paper should turn out to be\nlimiting cases of more general formulae. How this\ngreater understanding will eventually influence practice\nremains to be seen and will depend upon the further\nresearch outlined above. However, tension stiffening is\na major factor in the prediction of the deformation of\nlightly reinforced members such as slabs. In such mem-\nbers, deformation is frequently a major defining para-\nmeter in the design and any improvements in predictionFig. 14. Internal cracks around anchored bars15\nA. W. Beeby and R. H. Scott\n620 Magazine of Concrete Research, 2005, 57, No. 10\nmethods will be of practical significance. Worldwide,\nthere is remarkably little consensus on the cracking\nbehaviour of reinforced concrete, despite the derivation\nof very many formulae. Hopefully, this research will\nhelp to develop a clearer consensus on the behaviour of\nconcrete in tension surrounding reinforcement and will\nlead to more rational formulae in due course.\nConclusions\n(a) Study of experimental results where the variation\nin the strains in the reinforcement can be measured\nin detail shows that the stiffness of an axially\nreinforced tension member is directly related to the\nnumber of cracks. For a given number of cracks,\nthe behaviour is elastic.\n(b) The experimental evidence also shows that the\nvariation in reinforcement strain is linear in the\nregion where it is affected by a crack.\n(c) The length of the specimen over which the crack\ninfluences the stress distribution, So, is shown to\nbe proportional to the cover.\n(d) On the basis of these findings, formulae for the\nprediction of deformations and crack widths can be\nderived. These equations are shown to give good\npredictions of behaviour.\n(e) Consideration is given to the mechanism by which\nthe incompatibility between the deformation of the\nreinforcement and the strain capacity of the sur-\nrounding concrete is accommodated. It is con-\ncluded that the most likely mechanism is internal\ncracking rather than bond failure. Initial analysis\nof an internal cracking model suggests that it is\ncapable of modelling all aspects of the observed\nbehaviour.\nAcknowledgements\nThe work reported in this paper was started as part\nof a joint project carried out at the universities of Leeds\nand Durham, supported mainly through grants from the\nEngineering and Physical Research Council (EPSRC).\nSignificant further support, both financial and in-kind,\nwas provided by the industrial partners to the project.\nThese were: Arup Research and Development (R.
