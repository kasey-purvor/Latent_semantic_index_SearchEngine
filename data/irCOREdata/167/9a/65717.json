She suggests that \nthe success of the Sputnik shows: \n \nThat men everywhere are by no means slow to catch up and adjust to scientific \ndiscoveries and technical developments, but that, on the contrary, they have \noutsped them by decades. Here, as in other respects, science has realised and \naffirmed what men anticipated in dreams that were neither wild nor idle. (p. 1) \n \nFor Arendt, science and culture are intimately interwoven. Science is \u2017anticipated in \ndreams\u2018; in science-fiction writing, film and vernacular culture. This dreaming \nprovides both the rationale for experimentation and technical development, and the \ncultural and cognitive frames in which to situate emerging technologies. Arendt \nevokes something of Benjamin\u2018s sense of the dream-state (see Buck-Morss 1989) in \nwhich the imaginative and the material are complexly wrapped in the dynamic \nprocess of dreaming. Arendt\u2018s placement of the Sputnik\u2018s orbit in the wider context of \npopular dreams of space travel and extraterrestrialism also addresses the temporal \ndevelopment of new science and the emergence of new technologies such as \nnanotechnology, in which \u2017dreams\u2018 become \u2017reality\u2018. For Arendt this dreaming \nprovides the discursive and ideological context in which such developments are \npositioned. New technologies are firmly rooted in, and yet challenge and potentially \ntransform, \u2017the human condition\u2018. \n \nRecently, the philosopher Jean-Pierre Dupuy (2005) has used Arendt\u2018s notion of the \n\u2017human condition\u2018 in a provocative call for a \u2017philosophical foundation of \nnanoethics\u2018. Following Arendt, he suggests that \u2017men dream science before doing it \nand that these dreams \u2026 have a causal effect on the world and transform the human \ncondition\u2018 (p. 6). His use of Arendt\u2018s notion of the human condition \u2013 and her socio-\npolitical understanding of science and technology \u2013 allow Dupuy to develop a \npowerful case for a non-consequentialist \u2017nano-ethics\u2018. In contrast to existing \n 3 \nteleological frameworks in which ethical analysis is framed simply as a response to \nthe consequences of specific \u2017techniques\u2018(Luhmann 1992) \u2013 Dupuy re-directs \nattention to the transformative potential of new technologies. Dupuy suggests that \nethical analysis of new and emerging technologies should not only encompass their \ntechnical specificities but also the wider socio-political framing. That is ethical \nanalysis should not simply focus on  restricted analyses of individual scientific \ntechniques, but rather on the deontological and normative challenge posed by the \npotential transformations in the human condition.  \n \nIn this paper I build on and extend Dupuy\u2018s account by developing what might be \ncalled a \u2017non- consequentialist\u2018 politics of nanotechnology. That is, I attempt to \ndevelop a political rationale for the consideration of the normative and deontological \ndimensions of nanotechnologies. Despite the lively characterisations of relationship \nbetween society and new technologies in contemporary fiction writing, cinema and \ncultural studies, contemporary political debates concerning competing visions of the \nrelationship between technology and society are typically limited to arguments about \nvery specific technical questions. For example, in recent technological controversies \nconcerning GM foods and civil nuclear power, political debate largely centred on \nquestions of safety and the veracity of official risk assessment methodologies \n(Jasanoff 2005; Kearnes et al. 2006; Wynne 1982). There is typically very little space \nin such discussion for normative questioning of the way the social, political and \neconomic assumptions are built into contemporary technological imperatives. Nor is \nthere is there space to consider the potentially transformative dimensions of new \ntechnologies outside narrow debates around risk, safety and control.  \n \nHere I focus particularly on widely articulated notions of nanotechnology as enabling, \nand depending upon, \u2017control over structure of matter\u2018, and the ability to precisely \nmanipulate matter at the atomic scale. This vision of atomic manufacture \u2013 from the \nbottom up \u2013 once associated with radical and speculative possibilities of \u2017molecular \nmachinery\u2018, has become a mainstream vision of fabricating nanostructures \u2017by \ndesign\u2018(Kearnes, Macnaghten & Wilsdon 2006; Roco 1999). Whilst this goal has \nmuch social, cultural and moral resonance \u2013 particularly connotations of the control, \nthe creation of life and the technologisation of nature \u2013 its rhetorical scope is not \n 4 \nmatched by the more provisional efforts of contemporary nanoscience. Such control, \nit seems, is more difficult to achieve than might be imagined.  \n \nThis distinction between the dreams and vision of nanotechnology, and the reality of \ncontemporary nanoscience, mirrors an almost perpetual battle to lay claim to the \u2017real \nscience\u2018 of emerging technology \u2013 the so called \u2017truth behind the nanotechnology \nbuzz\u2018 (Berube 2006). Central to Dupuy\u2018s approach is the contention that \nnanotechnology is embedded within a set of future-oriented socio-cultural dreams and \nscenarios that imagine its possibilities and foretell of its potentially transformative \neffects (see also Brown and Michael 2003). Accordingly, Dupuy suggests that \n\u2017existing efforts in nanoethics \u2026 take extreme care to distinguish what they deem to \nbe serious science from what everyone refers to as \u2015science fiction\u2016\u2018 (p. 6).  \n \nSimilarly, Macphee (2006) suggests that \u2017contemporary assessments of technology \nare characterised by a failure to think the impact of technology beyond notions of \nreproduction and intensification, so they tend to envisage the political consequences \nof technology in terms of static repetition, generating dystopian scenarios of \ndisempowerment and loss of agency\u2018 (p. 65). Discussion and analysis of the \u2017social \nimplications\u2018 of nanotechnology has tended to mirror this process, with debate \ncentring on areas of societal and ethical concern including; the possible toxicological \neffects of new nanomaterials, social, political and ethical debates about the role of \nnanotechnology in enhancing (human) life, improving surveillance systems and \npolitical control, widening the gap between rich and poor and possible environmental \neffects.\ni\n Visions of nanotechnology as enabling control over the structure of matter, \nfor example, are represented as evidence for the increasing technologisation of \u2017life \nitself\u2018. As such nanotechnology is simply cast as an intensification of existing \nprocesses of technologisation.  \n \nThis is the dilemma for consequentialist accounts in which implications of new \ntechnologies are seen to emanate only from \u2017the science\u2018. Not only does this create an \nawkward dependence on scientists to articulate the social, political and ethical \nimplications of their own work, but more pragmatically Dupuy suggests \u2017what \nconstitutes [serious science] varies one report to another\u2018 (p. 6). This attempt to \nuncover the \u2017truth behind the hype\u2018 suggests a broader schism between theoretical \n 5 \naccounts of nanotechnology possibilities and their material actualisation in \ncontemporary nanoscience. \n \nDupuy\u2018s ethical account is, therefore, inextricably future oriented through his \nsuggestion that ethical analysis focus on the transformative potential of \nnanotechnologies.\nii\n Similarly, for Arendt, politics is about a certain form of \ntemporality and action \u2013 about creativity and newness. That is, her politics is based in \nthe future \u2013 in the transformations possible to the human condition. Her meditation on \nthe orbit of the Sputnik speaks not simply of technology as evidence of existing \npolitical stratifications. Rather, technology both enables and potentially transforms the \nhuman condition. The complex negotiation between dreams and realities of \ntechnological futures is an active political space in which such futures are actively \nworked out in the present, determining future social and political arrangements. By \nwidening the frame of analysis and assessment of nanotechnology of Dupuy insists \nthat questions of justice, fairness and transformations in the human conditions be \naddressed in the present. Similary, in their provocative call for a form of \u2017upstream \npolitics\u2018 of nanotechnology Wilsdon and Willis (2004) suggest that in place of \nquestions of safety and risk, normative questions such as: \n  \nWhy this technology? Why not another? Who needs it? Who is controlling it? \nWho benefits from it? Can they be trusted? What will it mean for me and my \nfamily? Will it improve the environment? What will it mean for people in the \ndeveloping world? (p. 28) \n \nbe addressed in the early stages the development of a technology. Rather than simply \nread-off the social implications of nanotechnology Wilsdon and Willis suggest that \nthe inbuilt political, economic, and normative framings of nanotechnology be \naddressed in its very development.  \n \nIn concert with both Dupuy and Wilsdon and Willis I suggest that this spatio-temporal \ndisparity between programmatic visions of nanotechnology and their articulation in \nnanoscience is precisely the space for a normative politics of nanotechnology. \nHowever, in describing a nonconsequentialist politics of nanotechnology I depart \nfrom Dupuy\u2018s notion of temporality. Drawing on both Henri Bergson and William \nJames \u2013 who both share a certain \u2017commitment to continuity\u2018 \u2013 I suggest the \ndisjuncture between the visions and realities of nanoscience is not simply a temporal \n 6 \ndisparity between what is possible now and what will be possible in the future. Rather \nthis disparity describes a rather more symptomatic temporal contingency in \ntechnology itself \u2013 what Bergson terms \u2017the virtual\u2018 (see also Luhmann 1992). \u2017The \nfuture\u2018 is, strictly speaking, unknowable and yet by positing a continuum between the \npresent and the future \u2013 in which the future is a product of individuation and \ndifferentiation \u2013 it is possible to construct a normative critique of nanotechnology. \nThe non-consequentialist politics I develop here, therefore attempts to address \nnormative dimensions of nanotechnology articulation in the present through a humble \nacknowledgement of our own ignorance in relation to the future (Luhmann 1992) \n \nNanotechnology Dreams \nNanotechnology is a field that is in flux. Though often ascribed to Feynman\u2018s (1960) \nlecture \u2017There\u2018s plenty of room at the bottom\u2018, the word nanotechnology itself is \nyoung, being initially coined by Taniguchi in 1974.  Its constitution as a field is \nlargely the product of recently initiated government sponsored networks of \ncoordinated of research and innovation activities \u2013 such as the US National \nNanotechnology Initiative, or nanotechnology research funding initiatives of the \nEuropean Commission. Nanotechnology also displays the classic symptoms of a \ntechnological field in its early development in which there is a clear mismatch \nbetween the (often) hyperbolic promises made about its potentially liberating and \ntransformative possibilities and the seemingly more mundane and provisional \nadvances made in laboratory settings (Rip 2006).  The key, therefore, to opening up a \npolitical account of nanotechnology is this relationship between the dreams of \nnanotechnology and their manifestation and permutation in contemporary research \nand development.  \n \nWhereas Arendt\u2018s account is vaguely populist \u2013 suggesting that science simply gives \nextended expression to a form of vernacular dreaming \u2013 Marcus (1995) describes the \ndream-quality of new technology in much more politicised terms as technoscientific \nimaginaries. Marcus suggests that tacitly held and deeply social assumptions shape \nthe development of new science and technology. New technologies \u2013 such as \nnanotechnology \u2013 are imagined as solving current problems, creating wealth and \n 7 \nprosperity, and bettering the human condition. This tacit dreaming is particularly \nevident in the strategic roadmapping and foresighting initiatives that attempt to \nanticipate and shape the development of nanotechnology. A number of such \n\u2017roadmaps\u2018 have recently been published, including a Technology Roadmap for \nProductive Nanosystems, a Chemical Industry R&D Roadmap for Nanomaterials by \nDesign, a Technology Roadmap for Nanoelectronics, and even a roadmap for \nNanotechnology in the Forest Product Industry (European Commission 2004; \nForesight Institute 2005; Forest Product Laboratory 2005; Vision 2020 Technology \nPartnership 2003). These roadmaps \u2013 which are typically sponsored and strategically \npublished by Governments and industry associations \u2013 offer scenarios that will be \nenabled by nanotechnology and as goals to be achieved. They attempt to give \ncoherence to the development of nanotechnologies and to lever discursive attention \nfor a range of specific ends \u2013 for example to emphasise the importance of \nnanoelectronics over and above other applications of nanoscience and technology. \nSuch imaginaries are ways of \u2017marshalling\u2018 the future through the deployment of \nhope, expectation and anticipation (Anderson this volume; Brown and Michael 2003; \nVan Lente 1993). They also serve to shape the field, advocating for greater research \ncoordination and funding on sub-fields of particular promise.\niii\n  \n \nSimilarly, public discourse and commentary concerning nanotechnology is dominated \nby speculative lists of existing and possible future applications of nanotechnology. \nFor example, Forbes magazine publishes an annual list of \u2017top nano products\u2018. The \n2005 list included nanotechnology-based footwarmers, a washable bed mattress which \nuses nanoparticles to create an \u2017semi-impervious layer that traps fluids and particles \nso they can be washed away\u2018, and the 3M dental adhesive that utilises a \u2017silica \nnanofiller technology that forms a stronger bond to tooth enamel\u2018 (www.forbes.com). \nAlternatively Roco and Bainbridge\u2018s (2002) National Science Foundation report \nConverging Technologies for Improved Performance provides an almost limitless list \nof possibilities enabled by advances at the nanoscale. This list of potential \napplications includes: more durable human bodies, efficient weapons systems and \nubiquitous real-time information systems. \n \nIn addition to predicted applications of nanotechnology other tacit visions signal the \nsocio-political expectations of the value of nanotechnology. For example, Doubleday \n 8 \n(this volume) suggests nanotechnology represents an \u2017intensification of concern in \nscience policy with the application of knowledge for economic growth\u2018. The potential \neconomic impact of nano-related products is typically cast as \u2017revolutionary\u2018. For \nexample, US nano-policy documents speak of nanotechnology as \u2017leading to the next \nindustrial revolution\u2018 (NSTC 2000a) and current estimates of the potential value of \nfuture nanotechnology industries range anywhere from the billions to the trillions \n(Department of Trade and Industry 2002). Doubleday continues by suggesting that \nbuilt into this expectation is the further expectation that strategic funding and \ninfrastructure support will maximise the profitability of UK nanotechnology \ninnovations. He suggests that this is manifested in an \u2017imperative to produce useful \nknowledge [which] has shaped the practice of academic nanoscience over the last \ndecade\u2018. \n  \nSimilarly Kearnes, Macnaghten and Wilsdon (2006) outline a series of \u2017programmatic \nimaginaries\u2018 of nanotechnology that operate as meta-level discourses and as key \ndrivers in the development of nanotechnology. For example, nanotechnology is \ndescribed as an extension of the \u2017miniaturisation imperative\u2018 and as perpetuating the \ninexorable drive toward miniaturisation of electronic circuits and data storage. Also \nnanotechnology is represented as a new kind of science which is both interdisciplinary \nand \u2017socially robust\u2018. Both Bennett and Sarewitz (2006) and Rip (2006) describe the \nway in which this discourse of social robustness is intimately tied to the expectation \nthat nanotechnology represents an opportunity to \u2017learn from the mistakes\u2018 of past \ntechnology controversies by building social intelligence and research into the \ndevelopment of the technology itself (see also Macnaghten et al. 2005). \n \nDiscourses of Control \nSuch discourses are enabled by, and dependent upon, the foundational conviction that \nnanotechnology represents a new scientific paradigm based on the ability to precisely \ncontrol and manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular scales. The vision of \nnanotechnology as both enabling and depending upon the precise control over the \nstructure of matter is best exemplified by the former HP researcher Jamie Dinkelacker \n(2002), who claimed that: \u2017Total (or near total) control over the structure of matter \nwill intrinsically revolutionise our lives. No Aspect of our daily living \u2013 let alone \n 9 \nother technologies \u2013 will remain untouched\u2018 (p. 2). This phrase \u2013 \u2017control over the \nstructure of matter\u2018 \u2013 is a symbol of the sheer promise and transformative possibility \nof nanotechnology. Despite its obviously hyperbolic tone, the imperative to gain such \ncontrol has become a paradigmatic goal for much nanotechnology research. This goal \nhas become the default objective for current research through which to realise the \nwider transformative possibilities of nanotechnology (Kearnes et al. 2006; Kearnes, \nMacnaghten & Wilsdon 2006). Roco (1999) signals this basic programmatic goal for \nnanoscale research, by defining nanotechnology as: \n \nConcerned with development and utilization of structures and devices with \norganizational features at the intermediate scale between individual molecules \nand about 100 nm where novel properties occur as compared to bulk materials. \nIt implies the capability to build up tailored nanostructures and devices for \ngiven functions by control at the atomic and molecular levels. (pp. 1-2) \n \nFor Roco, nanotechnology is defined as a capability to create tailored structures at the \nnanoscale, based on precise control and manipulation of matter at this scale. The key \nfor Roco is the injection of human-derived \u2017function\u2018 at the nanoscale through the \nproduction of tailored nanostructures and materials.  Though advances in nanoscience \nhave been successful in producing novel materials and fabrication processes, this \ndegree of atomic control remains elusive. As such the quest to achieve control at the \nnanoscale represents, for Roco, the underlying and unifying project of contemporary \nnanoscience research. Roco suggests that once such control is achieved it be possible \nto create tailored nanostructures with desired shapes, patterns and architectures.  \n \nVisions of control over the structure of matter are both theoretical and pragmatic, \nsuggesting that such control is logically possible and constitutes the \u2017next step\u2018 in \ndeveloping functional nanotechnologies and materials. The theoretical vision of the \npossibilities for precise control of the atomic scale is motivated by what might be \ntermed a biological turn in physics and a materialist turn in biology. Primary in this \ncontext is Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2018s (1944) essay What is Life? The Physical Aspect of the \nLiving Cell which implies a physicalist understanding of life by suggesting that \nbiological processes may be explained physically. In this work \u2013 which prefigures \nlater developments in systems theory \u2013 Schr\u00f6dinger explains the origin of life in \nphysical terms, through recourse to theoretical physics.  Indeed, the opening lines of \nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2018s \u2017little book\u2018 \u2013 a quote from Spinoza\u2018s Ethics \u2013 \u2017Homo liber nulla de re \n 10 \nminus quam de morte cogitat; et ejus sapientia non mortis sed vitae meditatio est\niv\u2018 \nsignal the intention to deploy the physical discipline of physics to explain life itself, \nand particularly the emergence of self-ordering systems.  Accordingly he asks: \u2017How \ncan events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living \norganism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?\u2018 (p. 3). Schr\u00f6dinger answers \nthis question by suggesting that life is implicitly atomistic. He argues that biological \nprocesses are controlled and determined by characteristics of their atomic \nconstituents. For example, he suggests that: \n \nThe unfolding of events in the life cycle of an organism exhibits an admirable \nregularity and orderliness, unrivalled by anything we meet with in inanimate \nmatter. We find it controlled by a supremely well-ordered group of atoms, \nwhich represent only a very small fraction of the sum total in every cell. (p. \n27) \n \n \nFor Schr\u00f6dinger living cells are physical. All things \u2013 and therefore biological process \nand life itself \u2013 are absolutely divisible into atoms and molecules.  Schr\u00f6dinger\u2018s \nvision of life also signals the importance of the notion of control. He suggested that, \nthough complex, the emergence of ordered, biological life is controlled by atomic \nconstituents of such processes. Through this vision of absolute divisibility it becomes \npossible to technologically manipulate life itself through the precise design control of \nthis atomic base (Mody 2006). Schr\u00f6dinger\u2018s suggestion that biological life is \naccomplished through the selective control over the movement of atoms and \nmolecules demonstrates the possibility of similar human designed processes.  \n \nThe second theoretical reference informing discourses of the precise control over the \nstructure of matter is what might be termed a \u2017biological turn\u2018 in theoretical physics \nand mathematics, particularly in the work of von Neumann. Von Neumann\u2018s theory of \nautomata \u2013 a mathematical model of self-reproducing systems \u2013 represents a form of \ncomputational determinism. His theory suggest the possibility that naturally occurring \nself-reproducing systems might be recreated through appropriate algorithms (von \nNeumann 1961). The goal, for von Neumann, is to \u2017apply the philosophy underlying \nnatural automata to artificial automata\u2018 (1966, 71). As such he prefigures the machinic \nimitation of \u2017natural automata\u2018 by suggesting that it is possible to create a machine \n 11 \nwhich recreates itself modelled on biological examples. Thus he compares Turing\u2018s \nearly work in computing: \n \nwhich is a box with a finite number of states. Its outputs are modifications of \nanother entity \u2026The medium which is fed to the automaton and which is \nproduced by the automaton is completely different from the automaton. In fact \nthe automaton doesn\u2018t produce any medium at all; it merely modifies a \nmedium which is completely different from it. (p. 74)  \n \nto a machine which is able to create copies of itself: \n \nThere is no question of producing matter out of nothing. Rather one imagines \nautomata which can modify objects similar to themselves, or effect syntheses \nby picking up parts and putting them together (p. 75, see also Cooper 1983) \n \nFor von Neumann, life is controlled by code and is essentially computable. The goal, \nfor von Neumann, is therefore the creation of sufficiently complex computations that \nwould model such existing natural systems.  \n \nVon Neumann and Schr\u00f6dinger provide both the vision and theoretical resources for \nthe precise manipulation and control of matter in contemporary nanoscience. For \nboth, \u2017life\u2018 is the benchmark against which to compare \u2017human-designed\u2018 machines. \nIndeed both marvel at the complexity of biological systems and the ability of living \nmachines to self-organise and self-reproduce. The key object is to recreate the \nfunctionality of living systems and the means and possibility of its technological \nrecreation (Lehn 2002). \n \nThis theoretical account of the sheer possibility of designing functional nanosystems \nalso provides the foundation for a more pragmatic vision in which accomplishing such \ncontrol represents the logical \u2017next stage\u2018 in the development of nanotechnology. For \nexample, Roco (1999) suggests that: \n \nThe promise of nanotechnology is being realised through the confluence of \nadvances in scientific discovery that has enabled the atomic and molecular \ncontrol of material building blocks, and engineering that has provided the \nmeans to assemble and utilise these tailored building blocks for new purposes \nand devices. \u2026 Assembling of atoms, molecules and collections of assemblies \nof molecules into nanostructures with a defined function by design, under \n 12 \ncontrolled conditions, is a critical component of nanoscale science and \ntechnology. (p. 5) \n \nFor Roco, current applications of nanoscience represent only the first stage of a \nbroader technological program. The \u2017next stage\u2018 is the creation of nanostructures \ndefined not simply by their novel properties but by their \u2017function\u2018 as objects of \nhuman-derived design. Control over the structure of matter is therefore represented as \nboth a theoretical possibility, and pragmatically as the \u2017next stage\u2018, that must be \nachieved in order to accomplish the wider promise of nanotechnology.  \nDesign and Evolution \nThe key terms of this vision are, therefore, design, precision and control. This \ndiscourse mirrors that of the \u2017fantastic voyage\u2018v by suggesting that the, as yet, \nunexploited space of the atomic might be subject to human intentionality and \nengineering (Schwarz 2004). The intersection of visions of control, precision and \nfunction with broader expectations of value, and the exploitation of the nanoscale, \nsignal the politics at stake in the development of nanotechnology  (Waldby 2002). \nNanotechnology represents an intensification of technological control over the atomic \nbases of life itself. Such visions of \u2017life\u2018, \u2017matter\u2018 and \u2017evolution\u2018 connect with \nenduring discussions of the implications of new and advanced technologies. Both \nFukuyama (2002) and McKibben (2003) present a dystopian account of the \ntechnological transformation of biological life through biotechnologies. For both, \nsuch technologies represent further evidence of Heidegger\u2018s notion that modern \ntechnology is defined as a project of alienation from, and technological mastery, over \nnature (Heidegger 2003). Alternatively, for Rose (2001), the penetration of design and \ncontrol into the atomic and material bases of life contributes to \u2017politics of life itself\u2018. \nRabinow and Rose (2003) situate contemporary biotechnologies as an intensification \nof political control over life itself and symptomatic of the broader Foucauldian thesis \nthat \u2017Power \u2026 is now situated and exercised at the level of life.\u2018 (p. 1).vi Conceivably, \nnanotechnology represents a further incarnation of this politicisation of life, with an \neven finer grained control over the atomic bases of life. The intensification of this \npolitics of life is further strengthened by the fact that discourses of control over the \nstructure of matter are themselves the product of wider socio-political expectations of \nthe value and transformative potential of such interventions. The transformation of \n 13 \nmatter at the nanoscale is therefore emblematic of this generic transformation in the \noperation of political power, such that molecular life is subject to control and \nmanipulation.  \n \nBoth accounts of the socio-political implications of the technologisation of \u2017life itself\u2018 \ntreat such technologies simply as evidence of a wider politicisation of life. \nTechnology figures as either producing the dystopic \u2017end of nature\u2018 \u2013 for Fukuyama \n(2002) and McKibben (2003) \u2013 or as an advanced iteration in the development of \ndisciplinary power. Casting nanotechnology as simply an intensification of the \ntechnologisation of life is dependent on a particular notion of the temporality of \ntechnologies, in which specific nanotechnologies are situated as discrete, temporally \nspecific achievements. Such accounts are dependent on accepting that visions of the \ncontrol over the material world will be developed in the future. Both accounts fail to \nconceptualise what Ardent characterises as the active and transformative capacity of \ntechnology. The political significance is not simply that matter is \u2013 or will be \u2013 \ntransformed by nanotechnology. Rather the politics of nanotechnology are constituted \nthrough the negotiation of visions and dreams of control and more provisional results \nof nanoscience research.  \n \nBoth accounts, also ignore the material contingency inherent in the development \nnanotechnology and visions of control over the structure of matter. For example, \nvisions of control operate in (at least) two ways (Bensaude-Vincent 2006). First, early \nspeculative and futuristic accounts of nanotechnology entailed visions of the direct \nphysical manipulation of matter. According to these accounts future nanotechnology \nwould be characterised by nanoscale machines, factories and replicators that would \ncreate objects \u2017atom by atom\u2018 through the direct and precise positioning of atomic \nparticles (Drexler 1986). The theoretical possibility suggested by both Von Neumann \nand Schr\u00f6dinger is suggestive of a second and more active version of nanoscale \ncontrol, in which processes of evolution and systems change are utilised and \nmimicked in the fabrication of structures and devices. Rather than directly manipulate \nmatter atom by atom, existing chemical and biological processes are used a template \nfor designing functional nanosystems (Jones 2004; Seeman and Belcher 2002).   \n \n 14 \nThe difference between both notions of control is the degree of intentionality with \nwhich matter is to be transformed. The direct manipulation of matter, atom by atom, \nindicates the possibility of creating fully intentional tailor-made and human-designed \nnanostructures. Technical discussions and debates of this vision have concerned the \nsheer technical feasibility of the precise manipulation of matter in this way, and have \nbeen characterised by attempts to lay claim to the scientific reality of nanotechnology \nand what is \u2017actually possible\u2018 at the nanoscale.vii The second account, in which \u2017life\u2018 \nis used as a template for nanotechnology, presents a more complicated and distributed \nvision of intentionality.  Rather than directly manipulate matter, nano devices and \nstructures would be \u2017created\u2018 \u2013 or grown \u2013 by using existing self-replicating systems \nor chemical synthesis as templates or by modelling the functionality of biological \nsystems such as protein or DNA (Conrad 1992; Huie 2003; Lehn 2002; Rasmussen et \nal. 2004; Whitesides and Grzybowski 2002). Such creations are, therefore, not fully \nintentional. Rather, they are the product of a form of intentional evolution. \n \nThe suggestion that nanotechnology simply represents an intensification of \ncontemporary biopower therefore ignores the fact that experimental systems rarely \ndominate their subject. Despite articulations of total control the material world the \nmaterial specificity of the nanoscale necessitates forms of control over that are both \ncontingent and provisional (Kearnes 2006).\nviii\n A political engagement with visions of \ncontrol over the structure of matter must, therefore, attend to this inbuilt temporality. \nParticularly useful in this context is the pragmatist notion of \u2017radical empiricism\u2018 in \nwhich felt experience is expressed not as a succession of atomic instants, but rather as \na continuum. William James (1909) outlines radical empiricism as a phenomenology \nof: \n \na through-and-through union of adjacent minima of experience, of the \nconfluence of every passing moment of concretely felt experience with its \nimmediately next neighbours.  (p. 326) \n \nIf life is cast, in this way, as immersed in a continuum of felt experience \u2013 which \nevades objective description \u2013 specific materialisations of life therefore represent \ntemporal modifications rather than discrete entities. Bergson (1911 [1988]) expresses \nthe creation of specific materialities in the context of this continuum as movement of \nthe virtual and the actual. He suggests that Bergson:  \n 15 \n \nI enter neither into one nor into the other nor into both at once, although both, \nunited, may give a fair imitation of the mutual interpenetration and continuity \nthat I find at the base of my own self. \u2026 Matter divides actually what was but \npotentially manifold; and, in this sense, individuation is part of the work of \nmatter, in part the result if life\u2018s own inclination. (p. 258) \n \nThe implication of both Bergson and James\u2018 \u2017commitment to continuity\u2018ix is that \ntechnological objects are themselves immersed in a temporally specific continuum. \nThis is particularly apparent, for example, in the histories of technology developed by \nLeroi-Gourhan (1943; 1945), Simondon (1964; 1992) and Stiegler (1994) in which \nparticular technologies are regarded in evolutionary terms as material individuations, \nruptures or breaks in an overall continuum of human \u2013 and non-human \u2013 \nexperimentation. For Bergson, new technologies are a result of a form of \ndifferentiation rather than heroic creation. He replaces a notion of \u2015realisation\u2016 with a \nconception of \u2015actualisation\u2016 suggesting that technical objects are provisional \nachievements that might also be subject to further change and evolution (see also \nDeleuze 1986; 1989; 1991). Dupuy suggest that visions of nanotechnology as \nenabling the precise control over the structure of matter are justifiable read as ethical \nand normative claims upon future human social arrangements. In extending Dupuy \naccount, I suggest that a normative politics of nanotechnology necessitates a rendering \nof the material and temporal ruptures that make such forms of control possible, and \nyet render them as inextricably provisional and contingent.  \nNanotechnology as a site of \u2018enchantment\u2019 \nIn late 2004 I spent some time at the Cambridge Nanoscience Centre \u2013 talking to and \nobserving nanoscientists \u2013 trying to unpack the societal, political and ethical \ndimensions of nanoscience and nanotechnology. The nanoscience centre \u2013 and others \nlike it in London, Bristol, Manchester and Newcastle \u2013 is an attempt by the university \nto coordinate and centralise nanoscale research in one building with shared access to \nresearch equipment, instruments and clean rooms. It is in this building that images of \nfuturistic nanoscience are perhaps best realised, with its collection of state-of-the-art \nclean rooms, open-plan office, research, and informal meeting spaces. The \nnanoscience centre is the also the lead partner in a larger network of nanoscience \nresearch \u2013 an Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) between the University \n 16 \nof Cambridge, University College London and the University of Bristol, jointly \nfunded by four UK research councils \u2013 the EPSRC, BBSRC, MRC and the MoD. As \none of the premier UK nanoscience research consortiums the IRC \u2017is directed at the \nvery core of nanotechnology and as such will aim to provide an underpinning \ninterdisciplinary activity with the general theme of fabrication and organisation of \nmolecular structures\u2018 (Cambridge University 2001, 2). \n \nWhilst at the Nanoscience Centre I met a young researcher \u2013 John.x He explained that \nthe aim of his research was investigating techniques for the synthesis of three-\ndimensional nano-structures and nano wires. As such the goal of his research was to \ndevelop ways of catalysing the growth of such nanostructures so that by controlling \nthe growth conditions he might be able to produce a reproducible method for \nsynthesising three-dimensional nano-structures with desired shapes, patterns and \nmorphologies.  \n \nJohn explained the goals of his research: \n \nIf we can understand how structures are grown then maybe we can tailor the \nway we grow structures and actually grow a structure which we\u2018re looking for \n\u2026 The whole point is that we want to be able to control the structure, the \nmorphology, and the size of these structures. Then [they can] self assemble \ninto an array and then from there it has some technological relevance because \nyou know you\u2018ve got control and you can reproduce the stuff which is the \nmain problem. (Interview with Researcher, Cambridge NanoScience Centre, \n2004) \n \nJohn\u2018s research is therefore concerned with the nature of certain materialities \u2013\nspecifically nanoscale silicon carbide. At a fundamental level John was interested in \nthe material properties of nanoscale silicon so as to produce more reliable ways of \ngrowing desirable shapes and wires. In this way the ambition of John\u2018s research \ncontributes to the meta-level goal of gaining control over the structure of matter. The \nkey goal for John was to create reproducible methods for the fabrication of \nnanostructures with and desired shapes and patterns. His research aimed not only to \ninvestigate the nanoscale properties of silicon carbide, but rather to create specific and \ntailored nanoscale arrangements of silicon carbide.  \n \n 17 \nHowever, John also explained that he primarily worked by using the existing \nliterature on the material properties of silicon and silicon dioxide to build computer \nsimulations of its growth and by testing these models experimentally. In his research \npractice, John negotiated a complex relation between theoretical simulations of the \n\u2017behaviour\u2018 of nanoscale iron and the behaviour exhibited in his experiments. \n \nI\u2018m trying to develop a catalyst technique which is reproducible. So that every \ntime I grow some nano structures I\u2018m using the same catalysts, or I know \nwhat\u2018s happening at that fundamental level. \u2026 And so I\u2018m trying to reproduce \na way of making iron nano particles to catalyse these structures and I\u2018m \nhaving trouble doing that. And you know I\u2018ve been talking to the author of the \npaper and I don\u2018t know. Something\u2018s amiss somewhere but I haven\u2018t found it. \nIt\u2018s rather frustrating. (Interview with Researcher, Cambridge NanoScience \nCentre, 2004) \n \nFor John, this frustration is caused by the disjuncture between his experimental results \nand what he had expected based on computational models and theoretical accounts. \nAlthough this ambiguity, caused by the difference between theoretical accounts and \nexperimental results, is a generic feature of scientific practice, John\u2018s frustration \nspeaks of a wider disparity. There is a disjuncture between the dreams of \nnanotechnology and the results of scientific practice (Rheinberger 1997; Stengers \n1997). Though John\u2018s research is situated within a wider attempt to investigate \npossible fabrication techniques, the reproducibility and reliability of such techniques \nhas proved elusive. This mismatch between the theoretical possibility of the precise \nmanipulation of matter and more provisional results of contemporary nanoscience is a \ncommon feature of the field. For example, another researcher at Cambridge described \nhow a priori assumptions of control and accuracy are moderated by actual research \npractice: \n \nMost of it is looking at what biology has done and saying right, I\u2018ll have that. \nSo you take it out of the biological context.  And sometimes they just do \nsomething that you don\u2018t expect at all.  We don\u2018t have the mechanisms to \npredict. We can\u2018t say right I\u2018ll take this and it will do this.  We\u2018re just not \nadvanced enough in our biology. It\u2018s a horribly complex system. It is possible \nto achieve control, but only by trial and error. (Interview with Researcher, \nCambridge NanoScience Centre, 2004) \n \nThere are many ways of interpreting this disparity. It is tempting to suggest that the \ndisparity between discourses of control and prediction and the provisional results of \n 18 \nnanoscience is a measure of the gap separating nanotechnology \u2017dreams\u2018 from \nnanotechnology \u2017reality\u2018. The notion that discourses of control and nanoscale \nfunctionality are simply fiction compared with actual nanoscience is an attractive \nproposition. However, for proponents of nanotechnology the difference between \ntheory and practice is simply evidence of a temporal distinction between scientific \nresearch and technological development. They suggest that such difficulties will be \novercome in time. Thus, for example, proponents of the creation of functional nano-\ndevices and molecular machines typically employ long time horizons in predicting the \nemergence of such developments.\nxi\n Of course definitions of what \u2017counts\u2018 as \n(legitimate) nanoscale research is the subject of much conjecture. Opponents of the \nradical visions of nanoscale machines suggest that this disparity evidences a broader \nimpossibility of creating functional nanoscale devices, and the necessity to gain broad \nconsensus on other goals for nanoscience research.  \n \nRheinberger (1997) captures something of the ambivalence of research practice and \nthe mismatch between theory and results. He terms the products of the experiment \n\u2017epistemic things\u2018, capturing the dual quality of objects that are simultaneously \nconceptual and materially situated. In defining epistemic things he suggest that the \nresults of experimental systems are: \u2017shaped in and occupy an opaque intermediary \nspace: they lie, so to speak, at the interface between the material and the conceptual \nside of science\u2018 (Rheinberger 2003, 624). For Rheinberger, the indeterminacy of such \nobjects suggests that they are objects of conjecture and argument in the development \nof scientific knowledge and the refinement of experimental systems. That is they are \npolitical objects. The disparity between visions of the control over the structure of \nmatter and experimental results serves a metaphor for nanotechnology in general. \nNanotechnology is a field in flux, characterised by competing claims to its \u2017reality\u2018. \nThe movement between discursive accounts of nanotechnology and the ambivalent \nmaterialities is a movement through which different \u2017realities\u2018 of nanotechnology are \nproduced, or \u2017enacted\u2018. As explored above, nanotechnology is the subject of an array \nof promises and expectation, which are ambiguously interpreted and negotiated by \nnanoscience researchers. Though such discourses play an important role in structuring \nthe meta-level goals of nanotechnology research, the relationship between \nprogrammatic visions and the everyday practice of nanoscience is complicated. In this \n 19 \nnegotiation gaps and tensions emerge between structural visions of the economic and \nsocial promise of nanoscience and researchers\u2018 own experiences.  \n \nFor example, in response to predictions of a nanotechnology revolution, many of the \nscientists interviewed were more cautious and pragmatic. One researcher at \nCambridge questioned the expectations that his science should be used as an engine \nfor innovation: \n \nI\u2018ve no interest myself in applying the science which comes out. I\u2018m interested \nto see what happens but I\u2018m not interested in being entrepreneurial with the \nmaterial... The goal as I see it is to do research and to get the results into the \nliterature and see what other people do with it. \u2026 I mean Gordon Brown and \nothers are perhaps trying to redefine my job to be something different and I\u2018ve \na lot of sympathy with that but I\u2018m not convinced I\u2018m necessarily the right \nperson to be doing that. (Interview with Researcher, Cambridge NanoScience \nCentre, 2004) \n \nThe mismatch between visions of control and the results of contemporary nanoscience \nalso, therefore, mirror a wider negotiation of social, political and economic discourses \nthat structure nanoscience and technology.  \nConclusion \u2013 Towards a Nano-politics \nThere are many ways of interpreting this disparity between programmatic visions and \nexperimental practice. For proponents of nanotechnology this disparity evidences \nsimply a temporal negotiation of such discourses. They suggest that control over the \nstructure of matter will be achieved \u2017in the future\u2018 and that predicted social and \neconomic impacts will therefore ensue. Dupuy interprets this future-orientation \ntemporally as a moment for ethical analysis and assessment and also therefore for the \npolitical negotiation of the normative dimensions of such claims upon the future. \nAlternatively Nordmann (2006) suggests that such claims on the future are more \nprecisely related to the politics of the present \u2013 in attempts to lay claim to the \nnanoscale and to create rhetorical leverage in the negotiation over the \u2017reality\u2018 of \nnanotechnology.  For Nordmann, nanotechnology is spatial and is defined by an \nattempt to inhabit the space of the nanoscale (Nordmann 2004).  \n \n 20 \nDupuy and Nordmann therefore position political engagement with nanotechnology \ndifferently as either a temporal project of debating claims upon (future) human \nconditions and social arrangements or as a negotiation of the present conditions \nthrough which nanoscience is organised as particular set of claims upon the \nnanoscale. Alternatively I suggest that a normative politics of nanotechnology might \nrethink the very possibility of \u2017laying claim\u2018 to either the temporal or the spatial. The \ndisparity between the \u2017dreams\u2018 and \u2017reality\u2018 of nanotechnology is not simply a \ndistinction between science fiction and science fact, nor a question of dreams that will \nbe realised at some future date. Rather, by adopting a radical empiricist notion of \nspatio-temporality \u2013 Bergson\u2018s notion of duration \u2013 it is possible to highlight the \nimpossibility of objectively \u2017laying claim\u2018 to either the temporality of the future or the \nspatiality of the nanoscale. In the same way that Bergson suggests that technological \ndevices are not simply discrete achievements, but rather moments of individuation, \nthe future exists as a form of differentiation.  \n \nA non-consequentalist politics of nanotechnology might therefore be cast as a way of \nrelating to an unknowable future \u2013 an acknowledgement of what Luhmann (1992) \nterms an \u2017ecology of ignorance\u2018. He suggests:  \n \nToday we can speak of the future practically only in terms of the probable or \nimprobable, that is, in terms of a fictively secured reality. We now know that \nfuture presents will bring other things than the present future can express, and \nwhen we speak of the future we express this discrepancy by dealing only with \nprobabilities and improbabilities (p. 95) \n \nGiven that it is only possible to speak of the future in terms of probabilities a non-\nconsequentalist politics of nanotechnology might therefore adopt a relational spatio-\ntemporality as an alternative stance to that of \u2017laying\u2018 claim to either the future or the \nnanoscale.  \n \nWhereas the possibility of creating functional nanosystems and tailored \nnanostrcutures is informed by notions of control and precision, this articulation is \ncomplicated by their ambivalent reception by nanoscientists. In the context of the \nelision between competing visions of nanotechnology, political power operates in an \nattempt to create coherence and consensus in an otherwise unruly field. \nRoadmapping, foresighting and standardisation activities utilise public policy to shape \n 21 \nthe development of nanotechnology toward prescribed ends. However these attempts \nto claim the future are complicated by the sheer unknowability of the future  \n \nNanotechnology does not simply represent a further intensification of the modernist \ndrive toward the technologisation of life and alienation from nature.  Though dreams \nof atomic control and precision are a permutation of this narrative, nanotechnology is \nbest described as a set of contingent technological futures. The social and political \nimplications of nanotechnology are not simply mitigated against. Rather in Arendt\u2018s \nterms the politics of nanotechnology is an active politics of creating the future.  She \nsuggests that \u2017the polis, properly speaking, is not the city-state in its physical location; \nit is the organisation of the people as it arises out of acting and speaking together\u2018 \n(Arendt 1958 198). In the same way that Jasanoff (2003) calls for \u2017technologies of \nhumility\u2018 and a re-examination of human pretensions of control over technological \nsystems we might imagine a mode of agonistic political relation \u2013 of acting and \nspeaking together \u2013 that adopts a similar humility in relation to the spatio-temporality \nof its inventions. That is, by attending to normative dimensions of nanotechnology \narticulation in the present we might humbly approach the contingency of our \nresponses to the future.  \n \nNotes  \n                                                 \ni\n Recent attempts to characterise the breadth of social concern associated with nanotechnology have \nsought to distinguish between broader socio-political implications and narrower question of \nenvironmental and human risk associated with new nanotechnologies. Accordingly Renn and Roco \n(2006) distinguish two frameworks of \u2017risk debate\u2018 in which narrow questions of environmental \ntoxicology would be tackled through existing risk assessment methodologies and wider social-political \nconcerns through political debate and consensus.  \nii\n My thanks to Alfred Nordmann for conversations on this point.  \niii\n There has been such a proliferation of such roadmapping and foresighting activities that a critique of \nthe possibility of \u2017roadmapping congestion\u2018 and lack of clarity has emerged (Smith forthcoming). \niv\n \u2017There is nothing over which a free man ponders less than death; his wisdom is, to meditate not on \ndeath but on life\u2018 (Spinoza Ethics, 1677 Pt IV, Prop. 67) \nv\n The 1960s science fiction film in which a miniaturised submarine in injected into the scientist Jan \nBenes. \nvi\n See also Foucault (1990). \nvii\n See for example the well publicised debated between Eric Drexler and Richard Smalley: (Smalley \n2001; 2003a; 2003b; Drexler 2003a; 2003b) \nviii\n In this context recent geographical scholarship on matter and materiality has emphasized the \nsignificance of what Kearnes (2003) terms \u2017the expressive waywardness of matter\u2018 (p. 149 see also \nAnderson & Tolia-Kelly 2004) as an expression of material agency that escape forms of technical \ndetermination.  \nix\n See Ansell-Pearson (2002) for an analysis of both James and Bergson on the notion of continuity.  \nx\n All names have been anonymised.  \nxi\n For example, Renn and Roco (2006) suggest that the development of nanotechnology can be broken \ninto four stages or generations: \n 22 \n                                                                                                                                            \n1st generation: Passive nanostructures from 2000  \n2nd generation: Active nanostructures from 2005 \n3rd generation: Integrated nanosystems from 2010 \n4th generation: Heterogeneous molecular nanosystems from 2015\/2020. \nWhilst 1st generation products are currently commercially it is claimed that 4\nth\n generation \nnanotechnology \u2013 truly functional devices \u2013 will be developed at some point in the future.
