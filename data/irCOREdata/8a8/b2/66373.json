One is traditional bilingualism referring to the use of a native minority\nlanguage and standard Chinese by minority groups and the other, seen as\nbilingualism with modern characteristics, is a modern-day phenomenon in which\nthe majority Han group aspire to produce bilinguals with a strong competence in\nmother tongue Chinese and a foreign language, primarily English, by using Chinese\nand the foreign language as mediums of instruction in teaching school subjects. The\nfocus of the analysis is on the latter for the simple reason that current literature on\nthe new phenomenon is mostly available only in Chinese. An equally important aim\nof this paper is to explore the impact of the new phenomenon on minority education\nand to examine the reason why this impact is largely ignored in bilingualism\ndiscussions, despite obvious consequences with respect to ethnic identity, person-\nality development and academic performance of minority students. Thus, the\ntraditional conception is briefly reviewed at the start.\nKeywords: additive bilingualism, \u2018favour\u2019 policies, linguistic fusionism,\nminority education, partial immersion, superior\u0001inferior mentality\nIntroduction\nIn its history under the communist government since 1949, China has\nengaged its 50 or so minority groups in bilingual education with the official\naim of producing bilinguals with a strong competence in \u2018Putonghua \u2019 or\nstandard Chinese (Chinese spoken by the majority Han nationality) so that\nthey can communicate with and assimilate into mainstream society and\nculture while at the same time maintaining their indigenous languages and\ncultures. Bilingualism by this definition therefore has a long association with\nminority groups and bilingual education has undergone trials, hardships and\nrevival in response to the political realities of the country. To the Han majority\ngroup that comprises about 92% of the total population, however, bilingualism\nwas largely a remote notion1 and it hardly, if ever, appeared in their literature\nof education.\nIn the last few years, this situation has drastically changed. Bilingualism is\nwidely seen as a useful tool by the Han majority for improving foreign\nlanguage education, particularly English teaching, and for developing human\nresources with both specialised knowledge and skills in foreign languages. In\nthe whole country, particularly in major cities and special economic zones such\nas Shenzhen, a school system is rapidly being developed in which English as\nwell as standard Chinese are used as the languages of instruction. From\n1367-0050\/05\/06 529-23 $20.00\/0 \u2013 2005 A. Feng\nThe International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism Vol. 8, No. 6, 2005\n529\nkindergartens to tertiary institutions, bilingual education has become part of\nthe everyday vocabulary not only of educationists but also of ordinary people.\nCatalytic factors, such as China\u2019s firm belief in its \u2018open-door\u2019 policy,\nmembership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2001 and the\nsuccessful bid for the 2008 Olympic Games in the same year, have helped to\npromote bilingualism and to reshape China\u2019s education system as a whole.\nAlthough substantial literature exists in English on foreign language (primar-\nily English) learning and teaching and on language policies in China (e.g.\nAdamson, 2001; Cortazzi & Jin, 1996; Hu, 2002; Maley, 1995; Ross, 1993; Zhou,\n2004), the literature on the new phenomenon is for the most part only\naccessible in Chinese.\nFor this reason, while this paper presents an analysis of the parallel\nconceptions of bilingualism, it puts an emphasis on the new trend, aiming to\nexamine the notion of bilingualism for the majority as conceptualised by\neducationists and language scholars. The response from the general public and\nimpacts on all stakeholders of education are also examined. Above all, based\non the evaluative analysis of the parallel conceptions, the paper discusses the\ninterrelationship of the seemingly separate phenomena, i.e. the impact of this\nnew movement on minority education of the country.\nBilingualism for the Minority\nIn China, the Han nationality is the absolute dominant group comprising\nabout 92% of the total population. The official language spoken by this\nmajority population is called Putonghua, Mandarin Chinese or standard\nChinese, which is based on the Beijing dialect. The standard Chinese that the\nHan people speak, therefore, may vary from one region to another. This\nmajority Chinese-speaking population has further expanded in recent decades\nto include about 30 million people from minority groups such as Hui and\nManchu nationalities who have gradually given up their own languages to use\nChinese as their first language. Nowadays, according to estimate, only about\n5\u00016% of China\u2019s population speak minority languages (Bao, 1995). However,\nthis population still numbers about 60 million, forming 50 or so minority\ngroups scattered in five autonomous regions and other provinces that cover\nmore than half of the total area of the country and border on a dozen or so\nneighbouring countries. Minority education is clearly important for the\ngovernment as well as for these groups in terms of national unity and\npolitical stability. Official education documents often state explicitly that the\nmain purpose of minority education is to maintain political stability and unity\nof all nationalities.\nBilingual education has had a long history for ethnic minorities in the five\nautonomous regions and other provinces. Some historians trace the notion of\nbilingualism back to the 3rd century when the country was united in the Qin\nDynasty and the Han majority began to colonise remote areas of the country\n(Dai & Dong, 1996). Frequent civil wars and migration inevitably led to small\nnumbers of bilingual individuals acting as mediators between the minorities\nand the majority or between minority nationalities. Formal bilingual schooling\ndid not start until the turn of the 20th century when the late Qing government\n530 The International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism\nofficially opened some bilingual schools both in major cities and minority\nregions, which were attended by the social elite of the minority groups.\nThe first decade under communist rule (the 1950s) saw an increase in\nbilingual schools in minority regions and the recognition of minority\nlanguages in education. In response to a stipulation in the first Constitution\nof the PRC passed in 1952 that \u2018every nationality has the freedom to use and\ndevelop its own language\u2019, writing systems of 14 minority languages were\ncreated on the basis of verbal forms by linguists and minority language\neducators. During those years, Dai and Dong (1997) note that educators in\nminority regions were given the opportunities to develop their own models of\nbilingual education. The period from 1958 until the end of the Cultural\nRevolution in 1977, however, saw a serious setback with the move from\nbilingual education to \u2018linguistic fusionism\u2019, which involved imposing the\nHan language on speakers of minority languages and even the suppression of\nall minority languages and cultures (Teng, 1996b). Minority schools were\nforced to use standard Chinese as the medium of instruction from the very\nstart of schooling. This resulted in serious detriment to children\u2019s learning of\ncurriculum subjects and the demise of some minority languages.\nThe end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s led to the revival of\nminority bilingual education and research in bilingualism. Official stipulation\nof the freedom to use and develop other languages and cultures was reiterated\nin the 1982 Constitution. Since then tremendous efforts have been made in\nminority regions in terms of language policy, indigenous language research\nand revival and bilingual schooling (Dai & Dong, 1997). In the last couple of\ndecades, survey findings and statistical data evaluating the effectiveness of\nbilingual education in various minority regions have rapidly increased (Guan,\n1995; He, 1998; Ouyang & Zhou, 1994; Zhongguo Shaosu Minzu Shuangyu\nJiaoxue Yanjiuhui, 2002; Zhou, 2000, 2001). A review of the literature reveals\nthat while accomplishments in terms of policy, teaching methodology,\ntextbook publication, and teacher training and levels of literacy are evident,\nparticularly in statistical terms, there are still many challenges and barriers in\nbilingual schooling and research. There is a general consensus that favourable\npolicies are important but in no way do they guarantee the effectiveness of\nbilingual education.\nSociopolitically, for example, Article 19 of the 1982 Constitution states that\n\u2018the state promotes the nationwide use of Putonghua (standard Chinese)\u2019, a\nstatement which is elaborated in a decree issued recently by the central\ngovernment (The Decree . . ., 2000). Stites (quoted in Lin, 1997: 197) comments\nthat this provision provides \u2018the legal and ideological context of China\u2019s\nofficial stand on societal bilingualism \u2019. Standard Chinese is thus reserved for\nformal and official transactions, while ethnic minority languages are at best\nused only in informal domains. Commentators such as Lin (1997) argue that,\nas standard Chinese is the avenue to economic opportunities and social\nacceptance, minority children are bound to be disadvantaged socioeconomic-\nally if they do not master the majority language.\nIn the last two decades, policies and official publications have placed a high\npremium on the notion of \u2018Min-Han Jiantong \u2019, literally master of both the home\nlanguage and standard Chinese, as the ultimate goal of bilingual education for\nEvaluative Analysis of Parallel Conceptions in China 531\nminority groups. For example, \u2018Zhuang-Han Jiantong \u2019 (Master of Zhuang\nlanguage and standard Chinese) is stipulated in regional policy documents as\nthe final aim for the largest minority group in China (Zhuang nationality in\nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region), \u2018Zang-Han Jiantong \u2019 for the Tibetans\nand \u2018Yi-Han Jiantong \u2019 for the Yi nationality in Sichuang (Dai & Dong, 1997). On\nthe premises of official stance of societal bilingualism as described above, the\nnotion of Min-Han Jiantong is often perceived as individuals who know well\ntheir own languages and cultures and who can even develop the merits of\ntheir own cultures. At the same time they are expected to be linguistically\ncompetent in standard Chinese and culturally capable of thinking and\nconceptualising in the language (Yang, 1998). Only in this way can bilinguals\ntruly maintain and develop their own cultural traditions and keep up with\ndevelopment in the wider society (Teng, 1996b). This \u2018idealised\u2019 conception of\nbilingualism is evidently prevalent in policy documents and seems to be\nunquestioned in the literature in China.\nThis concept of idealised bilinguals has long been challenged internation-\nally. Scholars such as Fishman (1971), Grosjean (1985) and Baker (2001) argue\nthat rarely can any bilingual be equally competent across all situations.\nBilinguals should be judged as a complete entity, as they tend to use their\nlanguages for different purposes in different domains of language use. What is\nmore arguably interpreted is the fact that the notion of Min-Han Jiantong goes\nbeyond idealised bilingualism to include bicultural identification. As indicated\nin Yang (1998) and Teng (1996b), it is the bicultural identity and hence the\npolitical allegiance to the nation state that are actually embodied in this notion.\nThis is an area under serious debate internationally. Some multiculturalists\nseem to hold the view that an individual can hold two or even more cultural\nidentities. Enough evidence shows that a bicultural identity is only possible\nwhere there is much commonality between two cultures, where there is a high\ndegree of acceptance by each other\u2019s culture and when socialisation into the\ntwo cultures starts at a very young age (Byram, 2003). It is extremely difficult\nto become a bicultural with two set of values, beliefs and behaviours, where\nprimary socialisation, the first socialisation an individual undergoes in\nchildhood through which he\/she becomes a member of a society (see Berger\n& Luckmann, 1966), takes place in a monocultural environment (Byram, 2003;\nHoffmann, 1989; Paulston, 1992). This is obviously the case with many\nminority students, particularly those living in autonomous regions in China.\nIt becomes apparent that, in bilingual education, it will be detrimental to\nminority children if the notion of Min-Han Jiantong is applied as a top-down\npolicy to all situations.\nA major criticism of the notion results from the lack of effective bilingual\npolicies and curricula to support it. Based on both a literature review and their\nempirical work, Ma and Xiao (2002a, 2002b) argue that there is enough\nevidence to show that minority children often suffer from \u2018cultural disconti-\nnuities\u2019 and thus a fear of learning standard Chinese as a result of\ninappropriate bilingual planning. National textbooks in standard Chinese\ncontain literature on the Han culture of course. While grammar of the\nlanguage may be acquired through instruction, its cultural meaning is\narguably more problematic. Minority children transferring from learning in\n532 The International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism\ntheir home language to subject learning in Chinese often feel that they are\nreading \u2018Tianshu \u2019 (heavenly books). Many children drop out of school at an\nearly age particularly when this Tianshu effect is coupled with minority\neducators\u2019 tendency to label minority children as \u2018slow learners with low IQ\u2019\nor blame minority groups for \u2018their traditionally isolated cultures\u2019 that tend to\nreject anything alien including the Han culture (Qian, 2002; Zhang, 1999). Ma\nand Xiao maintain that it is the inappropriate policies, curricula and negative\nattitudes that are the true barriers and challenges in bilingual education for\nminority groups. They further argue that measures should be taken to adapt\nthe content of learning materials so as to ease the negative impact on learners\nduring transition as irrationally imposing Han language and culture on\nminority children is detrimental to their cognitive development.\nWhat is presented by the critics of minority education here is clearly a case\nof what Cummins (1996, 2000) calls the coercive relations of power, i.e. the\nexercise of power of a dominant group to the detriment of a subordinate\ngroup. The society dominated by a powerful group tends to \u2018blame the\nvictims\u2019 for their \u2018genetic inferiority\u2019 instead of seeking for the true cause of the\nschool failure of subordinate group children (Cummins, 1996). In an earlier\ndiscussion, Cummins (1986) also argues that a minority child may become\nacademically \u2018disabled\u2019 if the language and culture of the child are excluded,\nminimised or quickly reduced in school. The \u2018cultural discontinuities\u2019 and the\n\u2018Tianshu \u2019 effect identified in Ma and Xiao\u2019s (2002a, 2002b) study reflect\nprecisely the cause (exclusion of the minority language and culture) and the\neffect (academic disability of the minority child) as argued by Cummins.\nEducators such as Lin (1996, 1997) talk in terms of the \u2018great-Han mentality\u2019.\nPeople with this mindset perceive minority groups as primitive, intellectually\nunderdeveloped, economically dependent and thus covertly or overtly\nmarginalise them. In education, this mindset is often reflected in exclusionary\nand assimilationist orientations which aim to make minority students invisible\nand inaudible or overlook them (Cummins, 2000: 45\u000152). This approach is\nsometimes evident in official documents. A recent Ministry of Education\nCircular on Hanyu Shuipin Kaoshi (HSK, the Chinese proficiency test) used for\nminority students (Jiaoyubu . . ., 2002) admits openly that these HSK tests are in\nfact intended for foreigners learning Chinese. They overlook the experience of\nminority students and therefore new tests have yet to be designed. In an article\nthat appears in the official flagship newspaper for education, Zhongguo\nJiaoyubao (2003) , the author, a senior scholar cum policy maker, explicitly\nclaims that the mainstream language in bilingual education in minority\nregions must be the Han Chinese.\nThe \u2018great-Han mentality\u2019 is also reflected directly or indirectly in local\neducational policymaking and practice. Despite the fact that the language of\nminority students is officially encouraged in bilingual education in minority\nregions, Jiayang (1999) reports that in some schools and regions head-teachers\nand leaders openly express their dislike of the Tibetan language and argue,\nregardless of circumstances, against adopting a truly bilingual model of\nbilingual education which allows the use of the minority language as the\nmedium of instruction. In discussing bilingual education in Yi -dominated\nregions, Shen and Luo (2001) point out that measures such as translating\nEvaluative Analysis of Parallel Conceptions in China 533\nChinese science textbooks and nationwide exam papers into the Yi language\nare clearly effective in facilitating their academic study and exam results.\nNevertheless, once they enter a tertiary institution their mother tongue has no\nmore role to play and they are forced to study all subjects in Chinese. Many\nsimply cannot cope and lag behind. As a result, the enrolment of Yi bilingual\nschools keeps dropping year after year. Many so-called bilingual schools in\nfact adopt a Chinese-only approach similar to that of the structured immersion\nprogrammes in the USA (Brisk, 1998) in which school subjects are taught in the\nmajority language to a homogeneous group of minority children with little\nnative language support (August & Hakuta, 1997). Yi is often only symboli-\ncally offered as an optional school subject or taught as a subject only before the\nschool-leaving exam as a mechanism for raising student marks.\nIn her research on two minority communities in south-west China, Hansen\n(1999) observed that, while equality of nationalities is preached constitution-\nally, the so-called deficiencies in minority students\u2019 academic achievement are\noften either explicitly presented as objective facts or implicitly understood\nthrough positive evaluation of cases of cultural change in the direction of the\nHan. This generates strong feelings of cultural and linguistic inferiority in\nminority students. In teacher training, Mackerras (1994, 1995) noticed, during a\nvisit to a teacher training school in Guizhou, that while half of the students\nthere were Miao, 30% Dong and only 20% Han, the teacher trainers were\nmostly Han and there was very limited Miao or Dong content in their teaching.\nHe furthermore pointed out that modernisation can be an even bigger factor\nthan education in the shift from minority to majority language and culture.\nAn overview of the literature of minority education suggests that minority\neducation in many areas, particularly in south-western China, is conducted\nwithin a national context that places a premium on standard Chinese and the\nHan culture. The predominant forms of minority education in these areas are\nthe submersion approach as mentioned above and the transition model where\nthe home language is used as the medium of instruction only at the initial\nstage and gradually or quickly gives way to standard Chinese as the language\nof instruction for all school subjects. These forms are what Garcia (1997) and\nBaker (2001) categorise as weak forms of bilingual education, which essentially\naim to assimilate minority groups into the monolingual mainstream society.\nHowever, strong forms such as the maintenance or heritage bilingual model\nwith emphasis on the home language of the minority students do exist in some\nregions such as Xingjiang and Inner Mongolia.2 The bilingual schooling\npractised in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in north-eastern\nChina, for example, is widely reported as the most effective (Lin, 1997; Zhou,\n2001). Nevertheless, in most other regions, insufficient societal effort in\ndeveloping learning and teaching materials for minority students and\nteachers, limited job opportunities locally and the difficulties minority\ngraduates face in the larger job market often hamper the development of\nstrong forms of bilingual education. For these reasons, Bao (1995) and Lin\n(1997) note that in minority regions it is common that parents, including local\ngovernment officials, have become increasingly reluctant to send their children\nto minority schools where the minority language is used as a medium of\ninstruction.\n534 The International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism\nBilingualism for the Majority\nThe notion of bilingualism seems to have grown a pair of wings in the last\nfew years and flown from the territory of minority education to capture the\nattention of an entirely different group of people, this time the majority Han\npeople, particularly those living in political and economic centres such as big\ncities, coastal areas and special economic zones. The bilinguals desired are not\nthe Min-Han Jiantong individuals as described before but people who are\ncompetent in a foreign language, primarily English, as well as mother tongue\nChinese. The purposes of the two kinds of bilingual education are therefore\nquite different. Linguistically, the former can be said to develop in minority\nstudents a strong competence in the majority language, namely standard\nChinese, while maintaining the mother tongue language and the latter to\nimprove foreign language competence and particularly the English learning\nexperience of the majority. Sociopolitically, the purpose of the former is, as\ndiscussed before, to create a bicultural identity (minority cultural identity and\npolitical or citizenship allegiance to the state) whereas the latter is not intended\nto change the identity or political allegiance of the learners but rather to be a\nmore efficient way of learning languages. To differentiate these two concep-\ntions of bilingualism, some scholars call the former traditional bilingualism\nand the latter modern bilingualism (Ye, 2003).\nThe recent growth of interest in bilingualism has arisen mainly from ever-\nincreasing exposure to the outside world, which has created a need for more\nindividuals who can communicate with outsiders, and partly out of general\ndissatisfaction with traditional teaching of English as a foreign language.\nThere is a general belief among scholars and policy makers (Jiang, 2003a,\n2003b; Wang & Wang, 2003) that bilingual teaching by using English as well as\nChinese as the languages of instruction in nurseries, schools and universities is\nan effective and perhaps the only way to produce enough bilinguals to satisfy\nthe needs of the contemporary society and to respond to the perceived\nchallenges of globalisation and internationalisation. Yi (cited in Jiang, 2003a)\nremarks that the current notion of bilingual teaching is based on the deeply\nrooted Chinese culture of learning and quality education. It provides a sound\ntheoretical base for the development of an effective system and models of\nforeign language education that suit the Chinese context.\nAs mentioned earlier, bilingual teaching is now an established feature in\neconomically privileged areas. But, how is the current notion of bilingualism\ndefined? What is the response to this new phenomenon from the general\npublic? What approaches or models are adopted by schools and universities in\ntheir implementation of bilingual teaching? What impact do these develop-\nments have on policy making, school curricula, classroom practice, teacher\ntraining, or on the education system in general? The following pages attempt\nto give answers to these questions.\nHow is the concept of bilingualism defined?\nThe most cited definition in the Chinese literature is the one given by\nRichards et al . (1998) that bilingualism is the use of at least two languages\neither by a group of speakers or by an individual. However, there is a general\nEvaluative Analysis of Parallel Conceptions in China 535\nconsensus that the ultimate aim of bilingualism in the modern Chinese context\nis to produce bilinguals with specialised knowledge in technical, scientific and\nacademic fields and who can, when needs arise, use English to communicate\nwith native speakers, especially specialists and professionals in that language\n(Wang, 2003a). These bilinguals are officially called Zhuanye Waiyu Fuhexing\nRencai (talents with integrated skills in specialisation and a foreign language)\nand are desired by the country for its social and economic development (He &\nDeng, 2003; Zhu, 2003). Thus, according to Wang, unlike in multicultural\nsocieties such as Canada and the USA, the bilinguals thus defined are not\nexpected to assimilate into any other culture as they do not find themselves in\na multicultural environment; and the language the bilinguals acquire is an\nadditional language that has only utilitarian values. It is also worth reiterating\nthat these bilinguals are totally different from Min-Han Jiantong bilinguals\naimed for in minority education and expected to assimilate into the main-\nstream culture or have a bicultural identity.\nWang argues that this notion is closely related to additive bilingualism\nas defined by Western bilingual scholars such as Cummins (1986) and Lambert\n(1980), for the obvious reason that the acquisition of English does not replace\nor displace mother tongue Chinese and culture. It is only a plus. This\ncharacteristic is important from the ideological point of view of Chinese policy\nmakers, because for decades the impact of foreign cultures on learners in\nlearning a foreign language has been the major concern of ideologues\n(see Chapter 3 in Hu & Gao, 1997 for an overview). This concern was recently\nexpressed in strong terms by the flagship newspaper for education, Zhongguo\nJiaoyubao (2003), in an article in which the author states that in bilingual\neducation, \u2018the mainstream language must be Chinese. Only when we \u2018\u2018put\nus at the centre\u2019\u2019 and when we focus on promoting the Chinese national spirit\nand consciousness, can we deal correctly with the relationship between our\nmother tongue and the foreign language under study\u2019 (my translation and\nitalics). It should be noted that this author is the same academic cum policy\nmaker who claims in the same article that the main medium of instruction in\nminority education must be the Han Chinese (see review on bilingualism for\nminority groups above). In other words, it is this political position that\nconceptions of bilingualism for both the majority and minorities should be\nbased on.\nThe distinctive definition of (English and Chinese) bilingual education,\nthat is, additive bilingualism with Chinese language and culture as the\n\u2018centre\u2019, reflects the long concern of the ideological impact of foreign cultures\non learners and helps explain why official responses have been so far\nsupportive, as evidenced in policy documents promulgated at different levels.\nIn sharp contrast to the notion of Min-Han Jiantong for minority education,\nwhich implies biculturalism as discussed before, additive bilingualism thus\nperceived is clearly ethnocentric and it ignores the cultural dimension in\nforeign\/second language education that is so widely acknowledged in the\nliterature both in- and outside China (Byram, 1997; Corbett, 2003; Hu & Gao,\n1997).\n536 The International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism\nHow do the general public respond to it?\nIn sharp contrast to the lack of enthusiasm faced by minority educators in\nmany minority regions as reported earlier, in the past few years reports related\nto English and Chinese bilingual schooling in mass media and academic\njournals leave no doubt that the general public in cities, coastal areas and\nspecial economic zones where the majority dominate have responded\nenthusiastically. In these economical and political centres, enthusiasm is\nperhaps most evidently reflected by the rapidly growing rate of bilingual\nnurseries, schools and higher institutions. Xinwen Chenbao (2003) reported that\nShanghai is the first metropolitan area to promote large-scale experiments\nwith bilingual primary and secondary schooling. Such is its popularity that, in\ntwo years, about 45,000 pupils in some 260 primary and secondary schools\nparticipated in an experiment in which English is used as the medium of\ninstruction for most school subjects such as science, mathematics, music,\ngeography, arts and crafts, PE, etc. except for Chinese. By 2010, it is projected\nthat half a million pupils will \u2018benefit\u2019 from bilingual schooling. In the nearby\ncity of Suzhou, with a much smaller population, 61 schools have been\ninvolved in bilingual schooling experiments and the numbers of such schools\nare increasing at a rate of 15% per year. Large- or small-scale surveys of the\nattitudes of the general public and educators, for example in Shanghai (Xinwen\nChenbao , 2003) and in Chengdu (Cou & Lu, 2003), show that the great majority\nof the respondents from all walks of life respond positively to bilingual\neducation in nurseries and schools.\nIn newspapers, there is never a shortage of anecdotes, as exemplified below,\nshowing enthusiasm and favourable attitudes towards bilingual schooling in\nparticular and studying English in general:\n. Gao (2003) cites a nursery education specialist\u2019s advice on how to teach\nEnglish to babies of 0\u000112 months old and reports that there is a large\nmarket providing teaching materials and resources for teaching English\nto babies.\n. Lin (2003) describes how a county school attracted more than a thousand\npeople queuing for about a hundred places to enrol their children in\n\u2018bilingual experimental classes\u2019. Some were from distant cities; some rich\npeople hired labourers to queue for them.\n. A nationwide Oral-English Competition in 2002 attracted more than half\na million primary and secondary pupils from 23 regions and provinces\nand lasted for more than six months (Zhongguo Qingnianbao , 2002).\nEnthusiastic educators and parents saw this as a showcase to demon-\nstrate the success of their bilingual children.\n. At the tertiary level, according to Cai (2002), the official goal is to teach\n5\u000110% of university courses in English by 2005. Fudan University in\nShanghai has already acquired more than 7600 course books from\nHarvard University in the USA and plans to gradually introduce them\ninto their classrooms. In the same spirit, Guangdong education autho-\nrities require their university teachers under 35 to offer all courses in\nEnglish by 2010.\nEvaluative Analysis of Parallel Conceptions in China 537\nMany other reports such as parents\u2019 hot pursuit for bilingual Filipino maids,\nsending their children abroad to learn English and making large \u2018donations\u2019 in\norder to enrol their children into reputable bilingual schools are of course\nstrategies that can only be adopted by the socially and economically\nprivileged. However, many parents, rich or less privileged, are willing to\ninvest at all costs in the best education for their children and this is currently\nbelieved to be bilingual schooling. On one level this attitude could be seen as a\nreflection of traditional Confucian belief in the best possible schooling (Weiyou\nDushu Gao , the most important thing in the world is nothing but schooling). At\nthe economic level, Lin (2003) quotes a parent as saying that material gains\nand other social privileges for bilinguals who are proficient in English and\nChinese are clearly the driving forces behind this campaign for bilingual\nschooling. This new societal phenomenon provides evidence to reproduction\ntheories developed by scholars such as Bourdieu and Passeron (1977), who\nassert that language education is a form of cultural capital, a historically\naccumulated social advantage, and that schools play a major role in the\nreproduction of social elites through language education.\nWhat models are adopted in bilingual schooling?\nIn the absence of central government policy, bilingual nurseries and schools\nadopt different approaches to bilingual teaching. Models range from total\nimmersion taught by native speakers using solely English as the medium of\ninstruction (Wang, 2003b; Xinwen Chenbao , 2003) to ad hoc classroom teaching\nwith occasional input of English vocabulary or expressions (Cou & Lu, 2003).\nImmersion programmes used (or experimented with) in schools are reported\nas the most effective way in terms of developing learners\u2019 linguistic\ncompetence in the target language (Xinwen Chenbao , 2003). Early total\nimmersion at nursery level is reportedly officially banned in some cities\nsuch as Shanghai (Xinwen Chenbao , 2004). As discussed before, ideological\nconcerns in language education are most likely the real motives for this stance.\nFor this reason, the model widely used and promoted for schools is typically\npartial immersion , in which both English and Chinese are used as the media of\ninstruction. This is clearly very similar to the partial immersion programmes\nseen in many countries, such as those in Eastern Europe (Duff, 1997) and\nSouth-East Asia (Jones et al ., 1993).\nSome research into this model involving both Chinese and foreign bilingual\nscholars has been reported in recent years. Qiang and Zhao (2000) discuss the\nfindings of a joint research programme conducted with two Canadian\nuniversities. In that programme, experimental classes in eight nurseries and\nfive primary schools in Xi\u2019an underwent a \u2018partial-immersion bilingual\nprogramme\u2019 in which children were immersed in English language environ-\nments for about 15 hours per week. They claimed that the children in the\nexperimental groups performed significantly better than those in control\ngroups, not only in English proficiency but also in terms of creative thinking,\ncognitive and affective development and so on. This project was highly\nacclaimed by the education authorities and vigorously promoted in the region.\n538 The International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism\nThe success of such immersion education experiments in China is hardly\nsurprising, of course, with the rich experience gained in Canada, since the St\nLambert experiment in the mid-1960s (Cummins, 1991; Lambert & Tucker,\n1972), and in many other places in Europe, Africa and Asia (cf. Baetens\nBeardsmore, 1993; Johnson & Swain, 1997). Most of the studies on immersion\neducation yielded positive results and helped establish models of immersion\neducation. The Xi\u2019an project reported in Qiang and Zhao (2000) proved that\nsecond language acquisition occurs in partial immersion education through\nthe language being used as a medium of instruction in the Chinese context.\nStrangely, however, many schools such as those in Shanghai claim that they\nadopt a \u2018transitional bilingual model\u2019 in their classrooms in which English is\nused as the main medium of instruction for subjects such as science, biology,\nICT and geography and Chinese for social science subjects such as history and\nlanguage (Xinwen Chenbao , 2003). It is transitional in the sense that, as the\nsubjects are usually taught by Chinese bilingual teachers, these teachers\npresumably use more Chinese than English in classroom instruction at lower\nlevels and move progressively to teaching the subjects using more or solely\nEnglish as the medium of instruction at higher levels. Zhang (2002) proposes\nprogressive use of English from 30% of school subjects for preschools, 40% for\nprimary schools, 50% for junior secondary to 60% for senior secondary. At the\ntertiary level, though universities may offer many courses using authentic\nEnglish texts (Pan, 2003), Chinese versions of the textbooks are often made\navailable to beginning students (Yu et al ., 2002). The actual use of English by\nteachers in giving lectures and by students in doing assignments and taking\nexams is also increasing proportionately with the decrease of use of mother\ntongue. Wang and Wang (2003) explain that the gradual progression from\noccasional use to frequent use of the target language in learning and teaching\nfeatures the transition of using English as a foreign language to bilingual\nteaching and learning in tertiary institutions.\nThis \u2018transitional bilingual model\u2019 needs to be distinguished from the usual\nreference to transitional bilingual education, which refers to those pro-\ngrammes that allow use of a minority language at the initial stage and\ngradually move to the use of the mainstream language in the classroom. These\nprogrammes are commonly found in North America (Lindholm-Leary, 2001;\nSaunders, 1999) and are often critiqued as being assimilationist, with majority\nlanguage monolingualism as its real aim (Baker, 2001). Such transitional\nprogrammes are also common in minority education in China, as discussed\nbefore. The distinctive use of \u2018transitional bilingual model\u2019 to refer to English\nand Chinese bilingual schooling by Chinese educators and policy makers is\nagain most possibly politically determined; as total immersion is rejected\nofficially in major cities such as Shanghai (Xinwen Chenbao , 2004), the term,\nimmersion, is avoided altogether.\nIn the past few years, some models seem to have developed along laissez-\nfaire lines. Jiang (2003a, 2003b) experimented with what he called the\nInfiltration Approach for primary schools in Shandong in which schools are\ngiven freedom to increase subject or content teaching in English according to\ntheir own situations as long as the increase is gradual. Feng (2002) and Tang\n(2002) reported a similar idea developed in Guangdong, the Integrated English\nEvaluative Analysis of Parallel Conceptions in China 539\nEducation model, which, as the name suggests, is basically an integration of\nteaching approaches in foreign\/second language teaching such as total\nphysical response (TPR), phonics, the direct approach and the oral- and\naudio-lingual methods. In Feng\u2019s words, in essence it encourages teachers to\nbe innovative and uses whatever theory, methods or material that prove\neffective in bilingual classrooms. A practical handbook by Lu (2002) for using\nthis model in primary schools is available.\nTo what extent does this campaign impact stakeholders in education?\nAs mentioned earlier, the country longs for Zhuanye Waiyu Fuhexing Rencai\n(talents with integrated skills in specialisation and a foreign language) and this\nnotion is reflected in education policies and in school curriculum reform. Feng\n(2002) states that the improvement of foreign language teaching, particularly\nEnglish, has become a priority issue for educational authorities of all levels.\nQuality English education is thus viewed as a key to success after China\u2019s\nmembership of the WTO and a prerequisite for general education and human\nresources development, with a direct effect on a person\u2019s career, the reputation\nof schools and even happiness of a family. It is in such a context that\nbilingualism is keenly discussed by all stakeholders in education. The\nimplications for education philosophy and practice, therefore, can hardly be\noverestimated.\nA re-examination of human resources for classroom teaching is perhaps the\nmost widely acknowledged consequence of bilingual schooling which, as\ndefined by many scholars such as Wang (2003a), theoretically concerns\nteachers of all subjects. Because Zhuanye Waiyu Fuhexing Rencai are the\ndesired outcome of education, in recent years English language competence\nhas become a main concern for the initial and in-service training of teachers\nand for recruiting teachers, particularly in major economic centres. Some local\neducation authorities at the tertiary level, such as Guangdong, explicitly\nrequire all subject teachers under the age of 35 to achieve a given level of\nteaching in English by the year 2010, either through self-instruction, further\norganised professional training or formal postgraduate study programmes\n(Cai, 2002). In a major recruitment fair for secondary school teachers in\nShanghai, certificates of CET 63 and computing were required by many\nschools (Xu, 2003). Needless to say, for recruitment in most bilingual\nkindergartens, nurseries and primary schools in economically developed\nregions, a university degree or a teaching certificate should usually be\naccompanied by a qualification in and\/or evidence of English language\ncompetence. Qualified educators from preschool up to tertiary levels now\nneed to be bilinguals who can teach their subjects in a foreign language,\nparticularly English, as well as in Chinese. Current numbers of bilinguals of\nthis kind are widely perceived as far from sufficient.\nThe impact of the new policies on EFL teaching is perhaps the most direct.\nIn the last two decades, College English, a nationwide programme taken by\nthe vast majority of tertiary level students, except for English majors and a\nsmall percentage of students taking other foreign languages, has enjoyed a\nleading role in China\u2019s efforts to reform education. It has been believed to be\n540 The International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism\nthe foreign language teaching programme adapted to the needs of Chinese\nlearners (Feng, 2000). The driving force is of course the ever-increasing\nawareness of the importance of English as an international language. A second\ncrucial factor is the associated nationwide tests, CET 4 and CET 6, which have\nimpacted on all stakeholders in education, particularly students in terms of\ndegree certification and job opportunities. Despite occasional criticisms of the\nnegative effects on students, these tests are regarded as valid and reliable\nassessment systems which have contributed greatly to the overall improve-\nment of students\u2019 competence in the English language (H.Z. Yang, 2003).\nHowever, in recent years, the tests and the programme have become the\nsubject of serious debate and the principles are increasingly criticised for\nundue emphasis on grammar and vocabulary and for producing students who\nsimply cannot communicate in the target language. A complete revamp of this\nprogramme now looks unavoidable (Cai, 2002). The focus of the debate is\nclearly moving from whether to reform to where and how to locate College\nEnglish in the evolving notion of bilingual education in terms of teaching\nphilosophy, methodology, material development, teacher training and lan-\nguage assessment (Wang & Wang, 2003).\nThough teachers seem to be the main party affected by this campaign, the\nstudents can face even greater challenges. Recent literature suggests that the\nimpact is currently felt most by students at the tertiary level. As many\nuniversities are enthusiastically promoting bilingual teaching, students often\nhave no choice but to cope with certain academic subjects offered in English.\nAs a result, a considerable number of students give up in the middle of the\ncourses, mainly because of lack of proficiency in English (Bi & Huang, 2003; Yu\net al ., 2002). From a psychological point of view, Hou (2000) asserts that many\nstudents feel intellectually underprepared, with course content poorly\npresented by largely incompetent bilingual teachers. However, success stories\nare occasionally reported. In a key university in Guangzhou, a mathematics\nmodule was offered to freshmen by an English native speaker professor using\nauthentic texts. After less than two months of \u2018heavenly learning\u2019 experience,\nthe students began to appreciate authentic English teaching and gained both\nlinguistically and intellectually (Li & Xia, 2002). On the basis of his research\ninto the attitudes towards bilingual teaching in his secondary school chemistry\nclass, Qiu (2003) managed to stimulate students\u2019 interest in studying the\nsubject bilingually and achieve the desired outcome with his self-designed\ncurriculum, materials and teaching methodology. Nevertheless, as Feng (2002)\npoints out, in a monolingual society where the target language is only studied\nin the classroom, it is hard to imagine if pupils can become bilinguals without\na strong societal and parental pressure and strong personal motivation.\nDiscussion\nAs stated in the introduction, while the literature documenting bilingual\neducation and bilingualism for minority groups in China is extensive and\naccessible to international readers in English, accounts of the recent campaign\nfor bilingual education for the country\u2019s majority group are for the most part\navailable only in Chinese. The present paper is intended to bridge the gap.\nEvaluative Analysis of Parallel Conceptions in China 541\nThe literature reviewed in this paper suggests that most scholars in bilingual\neducation put too much emphasis on the practical aspects of the phenomenon.\nWith this paper, the author wishes to provoke further examinations of the\nphenomena and in-depth discussions of theories underpinning the parallel\nconcepts. For example, key notions such as Min-Han Jiantong (master of\nboth the home language and standard Chinese) and Zhuanye Waiyu Fuhexing\nRencai (talents with integrated skills in their specialisations and a foreign\nlanguage) represent the official stand of individual bilingualism for the\nminority and majority respectively. Empirical research into the attitudes\ntowards, and perceptions of, these notions held by stakeholders in education\nrarely exists and the implications of these notions are hardly ever examined in\nrelation to the specific contexts of bilingual education for either the minority or\nthe majority groups. Further research into these issues and conceptual discus-\nsions will no doubt give rise to more insights into the concepts and under-\npinning principles for policy making, curriculum planning and pedagogy.\nOther issues raised in the literature include bilingual learners\u2019 cognitive and\nintellectual development (Chen, 2004; Hou, 2000), bilingualism in a mono-\nlingual society (Feng, 2002) and educational equity (Qian, 2002). These issues,\nas many scholars argue, are crucial for theoretical development in bilingualism\nbut rarely researched. Wang (2003b) remarks that discussions on English and\nChinese bilingual schooling are valuable but remain at the level of reporting\nexperiences and experiments that have only limited significance in the\nunderstanding of the phenomena. Research studies and insights of theoretical\nsignificance are yet to be published.\nWhat is clearly absent from the literature but urgently requires discussion in\nthe context of the debate on bilingual education in China is how the parallel\nnotions of bilingualism are inter-related. In other words, there is an urgent\nneed to explore how bilingualism as currently conceptualised by educators of\nthe majority group impacts on the traditional concept and practice of\nbilingualism for minority groups and how this impact could be addressed\nin sociocultural, political and educational terms. History repeatedly shows\nthat any sociopolitical changes or movements initiated by the majority group\nare bound to affect minority groups, if not vice versa . In what seems to be a\nnatural response to the English and Chinese bilingual movement, some\neducators such as L.P. Yang, (2003) have proposed the policy of trilingualism\nfor minority education (Sanyu Jiantong ). Guo (2000) is optimistic that trilingual\neducation in Inner Mongolia will succeed on the basis of student pass rate at\nHSK (Chinese proficiency test) in that region. These educators seem to suggest\nthat acquiring a third language (in this case a foreign language that is not used\nin any domain in minority regions) is as simple as the arithmetic calculation, 2\n(home language and standard Chinese)\u0002\/1 (foreign language)\u0003\/3. The initial\nresponse from these educators appears spontaneous and rational but it\noversimplifies the concept by ignoring the numerous contextual factors that\nare crucial to trilingualism and its implications for linguistic minority children.\nTrilingualism is by no means an unusual phenomenon and proves an\nimportant concept in many countries in Europe, Africa and Asia. Cenoz and\nGenesee (1998), in a review of the concept in relation to bilingualism, remark\nthat the latter helps the acquisition of a third language rather than hindering it.\n542 The International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism\nCenoz and Jessner (2000) and Cenoz et al . (2001) further researched and\ndiscussed the cognitive advantages and metalinguistic awareness of bilingu-\nalism in third language acquisition from pedagogical and psycholinguistic\nperspectives. The theoretical discussions and case studies reported by Cenoz\nand colleagues and more recently by Hoffmann and Ytsma (2004) suggest\nthat, for meaningful and effective trilingual education, the pupils\u2019 experience\nof acquiring a second language is crucial and, more importantly,\ntrilingual programmes need to be planned and implemented with a full\nunderstanding of the educational, geographical, sociolinguistic and political\ndimensions.\nFor trilingual education to be effective in China, according to these\nexperiences and studies, minority educators need first of all to address the\nfollowing outstanding issues. The first is, as mentioned before, the issue of\nunsmooth transition from early schooling in their mother tongue to learning\nschool subjects in standard Chinese at a later stage. As the experience of\nacquiring standard Chinese is not always smooth, some even drop out of\nschool at an early stage. A second issue in acquiring a foreign language is the\nfact that a large percentage of minority children rarely or never have any\nchance to study a foreign language in primary schools or even in secondary\nschools often because of lack of resources (Ju, 2000; Li, 2003). Those who\nmanage to continue may not start learning a foreign language until they reach\nsenior high school (16\u000118 age group). The exposure of minority students to the\nEnglish language is in no way comparable with that of their majority\ncounterparts, most of whom start at primary school and sometimes even\nearlier.\nA third issue is the Chinese language that minority students have to depend\non in foreign language learning. Wu (2002) points out that in fact, in most\ncases, the EFL textbooks minority students use are standardised nationwide.\nThese textbooks carry explanations or translations in standard Chinese. This\ngreatly increases the difficulty of learning the foreign language because the\n\u2018intermediary language\u2019 they have to depend on to learn the foreign language\nis in fact an assumed native language of which they are not native speakers.\nMany of them have to mentally retranslate it into their mother tongue in the\nlearning process. In addition to these outstanding problems, common\ndifficulties encountered in minority education include a shortage of qualified\nstandard Chinese and EFL teachers, the unfavourable economical conditions\nthat keep minority children out of classrooms to help parents in busy seasons,\nthe struggle for those pupils living in remote areas to study two new cultures\n(the Han majority culture and a foreign culture), and inappropriate manage-\nment or policies in minority education.\nThe experience of minority students at the tertiary level can be even more\ndetrimental to their academic and even personality development. As minority\nchildren find it difficult to follow the school curriculum and to gain access to\nhigher education, most of them, according to Wu (2002), rely on \u2018favour\npolicies\u2019,4 a kind of positive discrimination, for a university place. Once in\nuniversity, these students are placed in the same exam system and their pass\nrate is found to be eight times lower than their majority counterparts in\nEnglish exams such as CET 4, which is compulsory in most universities.\nEvaluative Analysis of Parallel Conceptions in China 543\nSo many of them have to re-sit for English exams repeatedly for certification.\nThis has dire consequences in terms of self-esteem, confidence and overall\nschool performance. Yu (1997) found that many of her minority university\nstudents consider themselves inferior to others (Ziren Buru ). Lin (1997)\nobserved that many minority students undervalue their own cultures and\nlanguages and took great pains to hide their ethnic identities by not wearing\ntheir ethnic clothes and by changing their home accents.\nLoss of sense of worth and identity as observed by many educators clearly\nruns counter to the aim of bilingual education argued for by many specialists\nin bilingualism and bilingual education. At the heart of minority education, as\neducators and policy makers agree, are the notions of equity (Qian, 2002),\nmutual understanding and mutual respect (Teng, 1996a), and the appropriate\nmanagement of relationships between pluralism and inclusion (Fei, 1989;\nSchmidt, 2000; Teng, 1996b) and language as a right (Skutnabb-Kangas, 1999)\nor ethnic identity (Teng & Zhang, 1997) and national unity. One of the essential\ntasks for minority education therefore is to empower the students, i.e. to help\ndevelop in them a secure sense of identity and self-esteem and to enable them\nto participate competently in the education process (Cummins, 1986, 1996,\n2000). The outcome of minority education should be academically and\npersonally empowered individuals who acquire control over their own lives\nand their immediate environment (Delgado-Gaitan & Trueba, 1991) and\ntransformation from a superior\u0001inferior mentality to collaborative power\nrelationships with the majority where their identities are affirmed (Cummins,\n2000).\nIf these aims for minority education are to be achieved and if trilingualism\nas mentioned above is to be implemented in minority education, the\nimplications that arise from this concept need to be debated from different\nperspectives with a view to the unique context of the country. Urgent issues to\nbe addressed include:\n. In view of cognitive development of minority students:\n. What can we do to help minority children achieve a smoother\ntransition from early mother tongue teaching to subject teaching first\nin standard Chinese and later in a foreign language (English)?\n. From the viewpoint of empowerment and ethnic identity:\n. How can we ensure that minority languages and cultures play a\nsignificant role in trilingual education at all levels?\n. How can we help the students move from the \u2018superior\u0001inferior\nmentality\u2019 to collaborative power relationship with the majority\nthrough the schooling system in general and trilingual classrooms in\nparticular?\n. In terms of balancing between equity and \u2018favour policies\u2019, pluralism and\ninclusion, and language as a right and national unity:\n. What justification is there for providing minority students with the\nsame curriculum and textbooks and making them take the same\nnationwide exams?\n. Does respecting language as a right affect national unity?\n544 The International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism\nConclusion\nThis paper evaluates two conceptions of bilingualism with a focus on the\nconcept for the majority and the impact of the contemporary English and\nChinese bilingual campaign on minority students. It is important to reiterate\nthat the issues critically raised in the discussion above do not suggest that the\nauthor argues against trilingualism as proposed by educators such as Guo\n(2000) and L.P. Yang, (2003). Trilingualism is clearly an inevitable and\npromising response to the language needs of minority students. In fact, it\nhas already proved effective inside China, in the north-eastern Yanbian\nPrefecture where Koreans concentrate. Zhang (1998) finds evidence to indicate\na \u2018positive transfer\u2019 from the bilingual experience of Korean and Chinese\nstudents to the process of learning a third or even fourth language such as\nJapanese and English. In the Korean case, Lin (1997) points out that favourable\ngeographical, economic and historic factors play a crucial role in motivating\nlearners. In acquiring a third or fourth language, many Korean students\ndemonstrate great efficiency because they have experienced the process\nof restructuring languages. Their experience further proves the theories\non cognitive advantages of bilingualism in third or fourth language acqui-\nsition developed by Cenoz and Jessner (2001) and Cenoz et al . (2001). This,\nhowever, does not suggest that trilingualism is a ready recipe for all who\nneed it. The argument presented here is that in conceptualising trilingualism\nif children\u2019s experience in acquiring the mainstream language and con-\ntextual factors, geopolitical, cultural or psychological, are not taken into\nfull account, children of minority groups are likely to be further dis-\nadvantaged, with a superior\u0001inferior mentality enforced and their identity\nundermined.\nThe absence of debates and discussions on the 2\u0002\/1\u0003\/3 (trilingualism)\nformula, i.e. on the impact of the majority concept of bilingualism on\nminority groups itself, may well be a reflection of the \u2018great-Han mentality\u2019\n(Lin, 1997), or the \u2018assimilation mindset\u2019 (Teng, 1996b), picturing minority\nlanguages and cultures as primitive, inferior and thus dispensable. The\npresence of discussions on the issues raised here, on the other hand, will\nhelp shed light on theories of trilingualism, and in practice will lead to\ngreater awareness of these mentalities among the general public, academics\nand policy makers in China, and lead to a situation where stakeholders of\neducation join forces and take initiatives to develop minority education\nprogrammes that value minority children\u2019s linguistic and cultural capital and\nhelp empower them while addressing the social and political context of the\ncountry.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Prof Mike Byram of the School of Education, University of\nDurham, for his valuable comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

There are always exceptional cases for this of course. Many minority regions are in\nfact mixed communities and the Han people living in these communities are\nmostly bilingual. Among them are a large number of local government officials of\nHan nationality who are bilinguals purposefully trained in institutions for\nminorities (Liu & Zhang, 1994). However, there seems to be little literature\nrecording and examining the experience of this population.\n2. There are five minority groups, namely the Korean, Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazak and\nUygur, that have their own writing systems in active use and a relatively complete\nbilingual minority education system from primary up to tertiary levels (Qumutiexi,\n1998; Zhou, 2001). This makes possible a heritage model with an emphasis on the\nhome language of the students.\n3. CET 6 (College English Test-Band 6) and CET 4 (College English Test-Band 4),\nwhich is also discussed in the paper, are both English proficiency tests\nadministered nationwide biannually for all university undergraduates except for\nEnglish majors. Those who score 60 or more out of 100 in the tests are awarded\nCertificates of CET 6 or CET 4. While CET 4 is taken by almost all undergraduates,\nfor it is stipulated by most universities as mandatory, CET 6, the highest level test,\nis attempted only by high-flyers. So the certificate of the latter is considered more\nprestigious.\n4. The \u2018favour policies\u2019 refer to those preferential measures usually taken by a\nregional- or provincial-level government to ensure enrolment of a reasonable\nnumber of minority students into tertiary institutions according to the specific\ncontext of that region or province. One of the most important measures is to lower\nthe aggregate marks of the nationwide entrance examinations in order to give more\nminority students an opportunity to enter tertiary education. Qian\u2019s (2002) paper is\nan interesting discussion about this issue. He points out that while the policies are\npolitically made in favour of minority students, they often lead to biases and\ndiscriminations against these students in their own institutions or in job markets\nbecause of the \u2018labelling effect\u2019 which tends to tag all minority students as\nacademically lower quality students who are there because of these favourable\npolicies. These policies, Qian argues, are in effect not fair for the minority students\nand for the society at large. Ma and Xiao (2002b) take a different stance.\nReferences\nAdamson, B.
