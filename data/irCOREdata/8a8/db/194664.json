The lightly fluorinated ligand was then recovered by hydrolysis of the Rf6-BINOL-Sn\ncomplex with dilute hydrochloric acid and was reused three times without loss of activity or\nenantioselectivity.\nIntroduction\nThe fluorous biphase system has been applied successfully to a\nwide range of homogeneous catalyses with excellent catalyst\nrecovery and reuse being reported.1 However, it is unlikely to\nbe exploited commercially because of intersolvent leaching\nproblems, the prohibitive expense of the perfluorocarbon\nsolvents and concerns about their environmental persistence.\nAn alternative approach, designed by Curran for high\nthroughput organic synthesis, uses fluorous reverse phase\n(FRP) silica gel as a solid support for the separation of\nfluorous-tagged products from non-fluorinated reagents, as\nwell as the removal of perfluoroalkylated reagents from\norganic products.1\u20133 The major advantages of fluorous solid-\nphase extraction are that fewer and shorter fluorous ponytails\nare required (,40% fluorine content by molecular weight)\ncompared to liquid\u2013liquid extraction using the FBS (.60%\nfluorine content by molecular weight) and perfluorocarbon\nsolvents are no longer required for either the reaction or\nseparation step. Recently, we reported the first example of\nseparation, recovery and recycle of a perfluoroalkylated Lewis\nacid catalyst, [Ni{C6F13C(O)CHC(O)C6F13}2], using FRP\nsilica gel after catalyzing the reaction between 2,4-pentane-\ndione and ethylcyanoformate in dichloromethane.4 We have\nalso extended the applications of this novel separation\ntechnique in order to recover and recycle lightly fluorinated\nBINAP ligands after the ruthenium-catalysed asymmetric\nhydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate.5 Here, we demonstrate\nthe efficient separation and recycle of a perfluoroalkylated\nBINOL ligand using fluorous solid-phase extraction.6\nResults and discussion\nThe three step synthesis of the perfluoroalkylated BINOL\nligand (1; H2L) is outlined in Scheme 1 and was developed\noriginally for the preparation of fluorous-derivatised BINAP\nligands.5,7 After protecting the binaphtholic groups, the\nperfluoroalkyl groups were attached directly to the binaphthyl\nbackbone by a copper-mediated cross-coupling reaction using\nperfluorohexyl iodide. Sodium ethoxide was then used to\nremove the acetyl protecting groups giving the air-stable Rf6-\nBINOL ligand which partitions preferentially (73 : 27) into\nthe organic phase of a toluene : perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclo-\nhexane biphase even though it contains 54% fluorine content\nby molecular weight.\nInitially, the reactivity and enantioselectivity of (R)-Rf6-\nBINOL (1) was evaluated in the asymmetric addition of\ndiethylzinc to benzaldehyde (Scheme 2) and compared directly\nwith (R)-BINOL using the methodology developed by Chan\nand co-workers.8 An excess of titanium tetraisopropoxide and\ndiethylzinc was used to ensure high conversion and enantio-\nselectivity. Each reaction was repeated three times and the\nresults from both systems proved to be highly reproducible.\nAlthough similar conversions were obtained in each case\n(Table 1), the product enantioselectivities were slightly lower\nwhen (R)-Rf6-BINOL was used in place of (R)-BINOL.\nOnce it had been established that the fluorinated BINOL\nligand was effective in the asymmetric alkylation of benzalde-\nhyde, the separation and recovery of the Rf6-BINOL ligand\nwas investigated. At the end of the reaction, dilute hydro-\nchloric acid was added to quench the excess diethylzinc. The\norganic layer was separated, dried, concentrated in vacuo and\n{ This work was presented at the Green Solvents for Synthesis\nMeeting, held in Bruchsal, Germany, 3\u20136 October 2004.\n*amc17@le.ac.uk\nAlison Stuart studied chemistry\nat the University of St Andrews\nand obtained her PhD in orga-\nnofluorine chemistry with Paul\nCoe at the University of\nBirmingham in 1996.

A highly fluorinated BINOL derivative that\ncontains six fluorous ponytails has, however, been recycled\nsuccessfully using FRP silica gel after the asymmetric addition\nof diethylzinc to aromatic aldehydes in high conversions and\ngood enantioselectivities.9 Unfortunately, the disadvantage of\nthis methodology was that the expensive fluorous solvent,\nperfluorohexane, was used to recover the highly fluorous\nBINOL ligand from the column.\nWe have also investigated the catalytic application of the Ti-\nRf6-BINOL system in the asymmetric allylation of\nbenzaldehyde using allyltri-n-butyltin (Scheme 3). Zhao and\nco-workers10 have studied this reaction and obtained good\nconversions and enantioselectivities in a perfluorohexane\u2013\nhexane biphase, but reported significant leaching (24%) of the\nlightly fluorinated BINOL ligand into the organic phase.\nInitially, we used the conditions developed by Zhao and co-\nworkers with only slight modifications. Dichloromethane was\nused as the reaction solvent because (R)-BINOL is insoluble in\nhexane. Good conversions were obtained for both (R)-BINOL\nand (R)-Rf6-BINOL (Table 2), but once again, the enantio-\nselectivity was slightly lower when the fluorinated BINOL\nligand was used in dichloromethane. However, by changing\nthe solvent to hexane the enantioselectivity increased to 75% ee\ndemonstrating that the perfluoroalkyl groups do not have a\ndetrimental effect on the abilities of the modifying ligand.\nIn the separation and recycling studies both the fluorous and\nnon-fluorous catalyses were carried out in dichloromethane to\nenable the direct comparison between (R)-Rf6-BINOL and\nconventional (R)-BINOL. The separation of (R)-BINOL from\nthe organic product, 4-phenyl-1-buten-4-ol, was first investi-\ngated on conventional silica gel. Since allyltri-n-butyltin was\nadded in a stoichiometric amount, it was not necessary to carry\nout an acid wash and so the crude reaction mixture was\nconcentrated in vacuo before being loaded on to the top of a\nshort column of silica gel. The 4-phenyl-1-buten-4-ol product\nwas eluted from the column with acetonitrile and analysis by\n1H NMR spectroscopy showed that it was contaminated with\nan (R)-BINOL-containing species that also gave rise to butyl\npeaks. Tin NMR spectroscopic studies confirmed the presence\nof tin in this byproduct and all attempts to separate this\ncontaminant from the desired product by solid-phase extrac-\ntion were unsuccessful. In a further attempt to carry out this\nseparation, the concentrated reaction mixture was left to stand\novernight and some crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were\nformed in the residue. The crystal structure revealed that a\nmonodeprotonated BINOL (HL)-tributyltin polymer was\nformed; selected bond length and bond angle data are given\nin Table 3. The structure of the monomeric repeat unit (Fig. 1)\nshows that tributyltin binds tightly to the deprotonated\nnaphthoxy atom of BINOL and forms a much weaker\ninteraction with the naphthol oxygen atom of an adjacent\nrepeat unit to generate a polymeric chain containing alternat-\ning SnBu3 and monodeprotonated BINOL units (Fig. 2). The\nhighly distorted trigonal bipyramidal tin environment, in\nwhich the tributyl groups are displaced towards the neutral\ndonor group, is very similar to the coordination geometry\nadopted by [SnPh3(O\niBu)(HOiBu)],11 which has analogous\nScheme 1 (i) Ac2O, Et3N, DMAP, DCM, reflux; (ii) C6F13I, Cu, 2,29-bipy, DMSO, C6H5F, 80 uC; (iii) NaOEt, MeOH, rt.\nScheme 2\nTable 1 Asymmetric addition of diethylzinc to benzaldehydea\nLigand Conversion (%)b ee (%)c\n(R)-BINOL 88 89\n(R)-Rf6-BINOL 88 74\na Benzaldehyde (1.20 mmol), Et2Zn (3.12 mmol), Ti(O\niPr)4\n(0.96 mmol) and ligand (0.21 mmol) in DCM (10 ml), 220 uC, 5 h.\nb Percent conversion determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. c ee\ndetermined by chiral gc.\nScheme 3\nTable 2 Asymmetric addition of allyltri-n-butyltin to benzaldehydea\nLigand Solvent Conversion (%)b ee (%)c\n(R)-BINOL Dichloromethane 89 79\n(R)-Rf6-BINOL Dichloromethane 85 66\n(R)-Rf6-BINOL Hexane 88 75\na Benzaldehyde (1 mmol), allyltri-n-butyltin (1.1 mmol), Ti(OiPr)4\n(0.1 mmol), ligand (0.2 mmol), 0 uC, 6 h. b Percent conversion\ndetermined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. c ee determined by conversion\ninto the Mosher\u2019s acid ester followed by gc analysis.\nThis journal is \u0001 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2005 Green Chem., 2005, 7, 316\u2013320 | 317\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n25\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n05\n.

This time elution\nwith acetonitrile gave clean product without any BINOL\nimpurites. After an acid wash of the product, ICP atomic\nemission spectroscopy revealed that there was only a very\nsmall amount of tin (1.24 ppm ; 0.02% of the original amount\nof tin added) and titanium (2.21 ppm ; 0.88% of the original\namount of titanium added) leaching into the product. Once the\nproduct was removed completely from the column with\nacetonitrile, a solvent switch to diethyl ether was then used\nto recover the Rf6-BINOL containing species. From\n1H and\n119Sn{1H} NMR spectroscopic studies of this material, it is\nbelieved that a non-polar, Rf6-BINOL-Sn polymer is also\nformed in this system and this accounts for the ability to\nisolate the organic product without Rf6-BINOL contamination\nin contrast to our earlier work on the asymmetric alkylation of\nbenzaldehyde with diethylzinc. When the isolated material was\ndried and reused in a second catalytic run with fresh aliquots\nof Ti(OiPr)4, benzaldehyde and allyltri-n-butyltin, only\nunreacted starting materials were recovered. However, it is\npossible to recover (R)-Rf6-BINOL from the Rf6-BINOL-Sn\npolymer by hydrolysis with 4 M hydrochloric acid and this\nrecovered (R)-Rf6-BINOL ligand was then reused in three\nfurther catalytic runs (Table 4).\nThe data show that similar product conversions are achieved\nafter each run, with a slight fall after the third ligand reuse that\nis most likely to be caused by mechanical losses of the ligand\nafter each recycle. There is also a small decrease in the product\nenantioselectivity probably due to a small amount of ligand\nracemisation. Only very low levels of tin and titanium leaching\ninto the organic product were obtained and the amount of tin\nand titanium in the product could be removed to below\ndetectable levels by simply passing the product, after separa-\ntion on the FRP column, through a second short column of\nsilica gel using acetonitrile as the eluant.\nA subsequent investigation of alternative solid supports\n(powdered PTFE, C8 reverse phase silica gel and conventional\nsilica gel) demonstrated that FRP silica gel is essential for the\nefficient separation of the (R)-Rf6-BINOL-Sn complex from\nthe organic product, since leaching of the Rf6-BINOL complex\ninto the product was obtained with all of these alternative solid\nsupports. Although the separation procedure was established\noriginally after asymmetric allylation in dichloromethane,\nexactly the same recycling protocol can be used after catalysis\nin hexane when the product was obtained in higher enantio-\nselectivity (78% ee). Analysis of the product by 1H NMR\nspectroscopy and ICP atomic emission spectroscopy showed\nthat it was isolated without any ligand contamination and only\nlow levels of tin (1.18 ppm) and titanium (2.11 ppm) leaching\nTable 3 Selected bond lengths (A\u02da) and bond angles (u) for [SnBu3(2-\nO-29-HO-1,19-binaphthol)]n\na\nSn(1)\u2013C(1) 2.138(5) C(1)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013O(2) 92.45(19)\nSn(1)\u2013C(5) 2.142(5) C(5)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013O(2) 95.24(18)\nSn(1)\u2013C(9) 2.171(5) C(9)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013O(2) 99.4(2)\nSn(1)\u2013O(2) 2.142(4) C(1)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013C(5) 126.2(2)\nSn(1)\u2013O(1)#1 2.549(4) C(1)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013C(9) 114.3(2)\nO(1)\u2013Sn(1)#2 2.549(4) C(5)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013C(9) 116.7(2)\nO(1)\u2013C(13) 1.383(7) C(5)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013O(1)#1 80.77(17)\nO(2)\u2013C(24) 1.363(6) C(1)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013O(1)#1 87.55(18)\nO(2)\u2013Sn(1)\u2013O(1)#1 175.01(13)\na Symmetry transformations used to generate equivalent atoms: #1\n2x, y 2 1\/2, 2z + 1; #2 2x, y + 1\/2, 2z + 1.\nFig. 1 Crystal structure of [SnBu3(2-O-29-HO-1,19-binaphthol)]n\nrepeat unit.

Acetonitrile was then used as elutant to\nrecover the product. Diethyl ether was used as the second\nelutant to recover any ligand not eluted with the acetonitrile\nphase. This was washed with 4 M HCl, the organic layer\nseparated and dried and the solvent removed under reduced\npressure to yield free BINOL. Only when both FRP silica gel\nand (R)-Rf6-BINOL were used was complete separation of the\nligand and product possible. After acid washes of the diethyl\nether fraction and removal of the solvent, the recovered\n(R)-Rf6-BINOL was used in three further catalytic runs\nfollowing the same catalysis procedure. The general separation\nprocedure was then used to recover the ligand and separate the\n4-phenyl-1-buten-4-ol product. After each run, the product\nwas washed with 6 M hydrochloric acid and the Sn and Ti\nlevels determined by ICP analysis of the wash.
