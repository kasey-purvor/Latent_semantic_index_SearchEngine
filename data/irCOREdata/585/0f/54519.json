The FPEC is a 2-stroke system comprising of two opposing combustion chambers [4-5] having a\ncommon piston rod on which is mounted a linear permanent magnet translator, Fig. 1. Thus, motion is\nachieved by way of combustion in the two chambers occurring in anti-phase. This eliminates the\ncrankshaft, such that the piston movement is free, being controlled by a linear permanent magnet machine\nvia a power electronic converter, such that variable compression ratios may be achieved.\nThe proposed system utilises the latest technology in combustion research, viz. a Homogeneous Charge\nCompression Ignition (HCCI) combustion system, running on diesel fuel. Ignition of the air-fuel mixture\nin a HCCI combustion system occurs when the gas pressure and temperature have reached a certain value\nin or after the compression stroke. This is a highly unstable process, since, in order to achieve HCCI early\nhOE 2005 - Dresden 0.1\nL.iicfycacy Bn.dn g ofaFrx flistoa Energy Convermr WEST 3-art\nE1.E Own5 Dreden ISBSN: 1)-75815-08-5 I,.I\nEmergency BraLine of a Free Piston Energy Cons erter WEST Martin\nfuel injection is required to ensure a homogenous distribution of fuel, with the risk that combustion could\noccur well before top dead centre (TDC), necessitating (state-of-the-art) control technologies.\nThe combination of HCCI combustion, the elimination of the crankshaft and the integration of a high\npower dense permanent magnet electrical machine, aims to provide a very clean and highly efficient new\ntechnology for vehicle propulsion. The target of such a system is to provide a power density in excess of\n0.6kW\/kg (excluding battery weight), and to have the potential of meeting Euro V emission limits when\nscaled up.\nThis paper describes the tubular electrical machine and outlines the FPEC system, focusing on the\ndynamic braking requirement, which is one of the many issues tat need to be addressed throughout the\ndevelopment of such a system. The worst-case scenario, for which a high dynamic braking ability is\nrequired, occurs when the exhaust valve of the combustion chamber tat opposes the chamber undergoing\ncombustion, does not close. Hence, the translator is traveling at high velocity with no gas to compress, and\nhence no medium to absorb its high level of kinetic energy, and the energy of the pressure difference\nbetween the two chambers. The braking requirement is both a machine-design issue and a control issue,\nand more importantly, the ability to sense such a failure early enough to provide the largest range over\nwhich to apply the braking force.\nInlet Teeth Coils Backiron\nPiston \/Port L\n' \\ ~~~~~~~~ExhaustShaft Permanent Valve\nMagnet\nFig. 1: Free piston energy converter (FPEC)\nBraking Requirements\nIn the event of a failure that necessitates the translator to be stopped to prevent damage to the FPEC\nsystem, the electrical machine needs to provide sufficient braking ability. However, the machine has been\noptimised for a specified generating profile, which, to a certain extent compromises its braking ability.\nOne common method of emergency braking employed with synchronous machines is resistive braking, [6-\n8], which also has the added benefit of being able to operate in the event that the failure includes the loss\nof the inverter\/controller. The other means of braking, active braking, assumes that the machine controller\nis still operational during the fault condition, since it utilises appropriate control of the synchronous\nmachine.\nWit an average velocity of 1 lm\/s, the velocity and force profile of the FPEC system are as shown in Fig.\n2, and given that the translator mass is 9kg, the kinetic energy of the translator may be approximated as\n550J. In addition to the translator kinetic energy, there also exists the energy owing to the pressure\ndifference between the two combustion chambers. Thus, a total energy in excess of TkJ will need to be\nextracted under fault conditions to halt the translator.\nEPE 2005 - Drraden ISBN P.2\nEmergency Brakingg of a Free Piston Energy Converter WEST M,,wdn\n2005 Dr-esden ISBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.2\nEmergency Beating ofahte Piston Energy Converter WEST Marvin\n............. ...\n.

It comprises of the FPEC combustion system, the tubular permanent magnet machine\nand the associated controllers, and is created in Simulink. The PLEXIM'0 Sulink toolbox is used to\nmodel the electrical machine as a dqO non-linear model with a vector controller. In the event of an\nemergency braldng, the velocity command is set to zero, and the velocity controller outputs a baking force\n(or q-axis current) demand to the electrical machine. This force demand is, however, limited to 2.7 times\nof the rate force, which is the maximum force that can be applied during braking [9]. The two combustion\nunits compute the pressure and force due to combustion process for the given power demand. This force\ntogether with the frictional force calculated from a dedicated fiction model is fed into the mechanical\nmodel which govems the movement ofthe piston and the translator of electrical machine.\nvelocity\nCurrant Electrical machine dinplacemn\nde!mandfoe\nid + X\nChamber 1 Chamber 1 praesu e~\nelectneal machine v 4 model\nmodel Farction forceL\nFncc mon pbuit Fodinf\nmod0el Chamber 2 pressure\ndisplac:omnot. *x\nP Com bustion f orre\nQc ).bustionm\nCombustion force Chamber 2\nmodel\nFig. 8. Simulation block diagram ofthe FPEC, excluding controller.\nTo simulate the effects of a fault an exhaust valve failing to close, the simulation model assumes the fault\nis detected immediately, as the valve is ordered to close, and that no retarding force other than friction\nexists. In practice, the pressure in the 'opened' cylinder would actually present a relatively small but non-\nzero retarding force due to the choked flow of compressible gas through the opening of the exhaust, but\nthis has been omitted in the following study, for simplicity.\nFig. 9 shows the electromagnetic force profiles that are required of the electrical machine over a number\nof generating strokes for a constant power generation of 1.0 per unit, and the emergency braldng force that\nmay be actively obtained in the event of a detected fault. The profiles are given for various converter de-\nlink supply voltages. It can be seen that at high speed, due to the high back-EMF which is generated in the\nwindings of the tubular machine, the developed electromagnetic force is limited when operated from low\ndc-link voltages. At maximum force, which can be obtained at almost all velocities for dc link voltage >\n400V, the machine is operated at its current limit (the vector controller maintaining the phase currents at\ntwice of the rated value)\nFig. 10 shows the emergency braking force of the electrical machine when operating at various output\npowers for a dc-link voltage of 350V. Whilst some limitation in the braking force at high speeds is\nevident, this is negligible compared to other factors, such as the retarding force due to 'pumping losses'\nand prospect for detecting the fault conditions slightly earlier.\nLIt 2005 - t)nesden Its\nL.iicfycacy Bn.dn g ofaFiw lli.ton E=-,-y Coavc,-rter WEST 3-art\nDEl Own5 L)i--;c11i ISBSN :9(U1548tf-5 I,.f\nEmergency Braising of a late Piston Energy Convener WEST Marvin\n3\nI I \/-\nlI\n200V\n350V\nDC-Link 500V\nJ\nI)\nI UE\n4W9\"WuF Ule7 'Xl-It\/Rbn.\n\\\\ I ,\nwal.-ao+-lr+o ~ 11 ,-N-\n1.~ - \"---\nnm arganciy uiara sM4 s\n..a A -vs\n-8 -6 -4 -2 0\nVelocity, M\/s\n2 4 6 8 10\nFig. 9.

It can be seen that in all tbree cases, if braking is applied\nimmediately after the fault being detected, the tranlator will be stopped before reaching TDC. It is also\neident that limited benefit is gained with regard to the braking of the ranslator for dc-link voltages >\n350V; which again highlights the fact that early fault detection has a major influece on the braking\ncapability.\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\nVelocity. m\/s\nFig. 11 Variation oftranslator position with velocity under braking\nFig. 12 Prototype ofa free-piston energy converter\nEVE 2.'G'5 - Dee4dell 1&EY4 P?\nEtu!L-q-ciicy Bnl,*,zf .

A candidate FPEC with an integrated tubular PM synchronous\ngenerator has been used to demonstrate that either passive or active braking, or a combination ofboth may\nultimately be necessary, and to highlight the fact that due to the very high combustion forces which are\ngenerated and the floating TDC characteristic of FPECs, early detection of a fault condition is essential if\ncatastrophic damage is to be avoided. It has also been shown that the electrical machine impedance and\nthe dc-link voltage have sigpificant impact on the ability to brake the translator. Ulimately, this impacts\non the size and rating of the electrical energy storage medium (capacitor, battery, flywheel etc) required\nfor an FPEC system.\nReferences\n[1] P. Van Blarigan, N.
