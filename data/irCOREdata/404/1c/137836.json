Introduction \nMathematical models are used to evaluate the potential for leaching of pesticides to \ngroundwater within regulatory procedures. Traditionally, deterministic approaches have \nbeen applied where a single combination of model input parameters is used to predict a \nsingle time series of concentrations in leachate. The parameter combination is often \nselected to represent realistic worst-case conditions, but the likelihood of this \ncombination occurring under real environmental and usage conditions is not assessed. \nDeterministic procedures do not account for the uncertainty in the modelling which \narises from various sources (Dubus et al., 2003), such as the spatial and temporal \nvariability in factors influencing pesticide behaviour (Rao and Wagenet, 1985) or the \nuncertainty associated with the measurement, calculation or estimation of input \nparameters (Loague and Green, 1991). Although deterministic assessments may be \nappropriate for lower tiers of the regulatory process, it is increasingly recognised that \nthe uncertainty in model input parameters should be taken into account in regulatory \n2 \ndecision making at higher tiers (Laskowski, 1999; Solomon, 1999). This can be \nachieved by running a deterministic model many times for a large number of different \ninput values or modelling scenarios followed by a statistical analysis of the model \noutput. This would allow evaluating the uncertainty in model predictions and estimating \nthe confidence that should be assigned to modelling results. An end result of such \nprobabilistic assessments is the likelihood and frequency of exceeding a threshold \nenvironmental concentration. An increasing number of studies incorporating uncertainty \nin pesticide risk assessments have been reported in the literature (Di and Aylmore, \n1997; Li et al., 1998; Laskowski, 1999; Zacharias et al., 1999; Carbone et al., 2002). \n \nThe wide range of factors that influence pesticide fate such as soil type, hydrogeology, \nclimate, cropping, usage patterns and physico-chemical pesticide properties makes \nprobabilistic assessments highly complex. One of the factors causing variability in \npesticide leaching to depth is the heterogeneity of soil and pesticide properties (Rao and \nWagenet, 1985; Flury et al., 1998). Pesticide degradation and sorption were found to \nvary in space and time in a number of studies (Walker and Brown, 1985; Beck et al., \n1996; Vischetti et al., 1997). This is mainly due to the variability in soil physical, \nchemical and biological factors which influence degradation and sorption processes \n(Parkin, 1993). A particularly large variability in soil hydrological properties which \ninfluence water movement and associated solute leaching is found for soils which are \nprone to preferential flow. Preferential flow refers to a situation where water infiltrating \na soil does not equilibrate with the resident soil water, but flows rapidly to depth.  For \nexample, shrinkage cracks, earthworm channels or root holes may operate as flow \npathways in which water moves rapidly downwards and by-passes the denser soil \nmatrix. Preferential flow pathways are not permanent structures and they are not evenly \n3 \ndistributed across the field. Rather, they vary greatly in time and space (Ogden et al., \n1999).  \n \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate probabilistic modelling approaches against data \non leaching of isoproturon through two contrasting soil types. Leaching through \nundisturbed lysimeters from a sandy loam (Wick series) and a moderately structured \nclay loam (Hodnet series) was investigated in seven replicated lysimeters. Measured soil \nproperties, pesticide sorption and degradation values were analysed statistically and the \ndata were used to simulate movement of isoproturon with the preferential flow model \nMACRO. This model was selected to exemplify the approach, which is itself generic \nand broadly applicable. Distributions for pesticide loss predicted by the model were \ncompared to observed data. \n \n2. Lysimeter experiment \n2.1 Experimental methodology \nA two-year lysimeter experiment was undertaken which investigated the leaching of \nisoproturon through two undisturbed soils. Materials and methods, experimental data \nand modelling results for the first study period are presented in detail elsewhere (Beulke \net al., 2002). The methodology used in the second experimental season is summarised \nbelow.  \n \nLeaching of isoproturon through undisturbed lysimeters from a sandy loam (Wick \nseries) and a moderately structured clay loam (Hodnet series) was investigated in seven \nreplicates. Matrix flow is expected to be the dominant process in the sandy Wick soil, \n4 \nalthough potential preferential pathways in the form of vertical worm channels were \nobserved in the field. The structured clay loam was selected to represent a soil type \nwhere preferential flow is clearly an important process. Average values for the main \nproperties of the Wick and Hodnet soil are given in Table 1. \n \nUndisturbed soil cores (25 cm diameter, 50 cm length) were extracted in October 1998 \nfrom arable fields in Warwickshire, UK and transferred to a lysimeter facility in Silsoe, \nBedfordshire. The study was started on 15 December 1998. There was no leaching from \nmid April 1999 onwards. The last sample was taken on 14 April 1999 (120 days after \napplication) and results will be presented up to this date. The study was terminated on \n15 May when no additional significant leaching was expected due to increasing \nevapotranspiration in the warmer summer months. The rainfall volume received for \neach treatment was adjusted to match a target range by covering lysimeters during \nparticularly wet periods and\/or adding artificial irrigation where necessary. Total input \nof rainfall + irrigation from mid December to mid May was 260 mm.  \n \nRadiolabelled isoproturon was applied to the lysimeters in mid December 1998. For \neach lysimeter, [14C] ring-labelled isoproturon (radioactive purity >99%, specific \nactivity 2.56 GBq mmole-1) was mixed approximately 1:30 with non-labelled \nisoproturon and dissolved in 60:40 water:methanol (3.0 ml) to give a dose equivalent to \n2.5 kg a.s. ha-1. The specific activity of the applied mixture was 76.7 MBq mmole-1 and \nthe activity applied per lysimeter was 4.01 MBq. The isoproturon solution was applied \nto the lysimeters using a pipette and followed by two methanol rinses. Flow from each \nlysimeter was collected at regular intervals over the winter, measured for volume and \nsubsamples analysed for amount of radioactivity.  \n5 \n Soil samples were taken from up to 50-cm depth from the area of lysimeter extraction in \nthe field to characterise the variability in soil characteristics. In autumn 1997, samples \nwere taken at 10 locations within 1 m of the points of lysimeter extraction. Soil was \nsampled in 10-cm increments up to 30-cm depth and analysed for organic carbon \ncontent. Additional analyses of organic carbon contents were carried out for six samples \nfrom 30-40 and 40-50 cm depth. Bulk density and water release characteristics were \ndetermined for samples taken at six points from 0-50 cm depth in 10-cm increments. \nParticle size distribution, pH and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured at up \nto 2 sampling points in the field. In autumn 1998, samples were taken from the same \nfield within 0.5 m of the point of extraction of each of the fourteen lysimeters. Samples \nfrom 0-30 cm were analysed for organic carbon content and pH. Bulk density and \nselected points of the water release curve (0, -1 and \u20135 kPa) were determined for \nsamples taken from 10-15 cm to characterise topsoil properties. \n \nSorption and degradation of isoproturon was investigated in samples taken at the time of \nlysimeter extraction from 10 different locations within the same fields. In order to \ncharacterise degradation, soil samples were treated with isoproturon (15 mg a.s. kg-1 \nsoil) and incubated in the laboratory at a temperature of 15oC and a soil moisture \ncontent equivalent to a matric potential of \u201333 kPa (18.2% w\/w, Wick; 30.0% w\/w, \nHodnet). Soil residues were measured at intervals and first-order DT50 values were \nderived from these data. DT50 values indicate the time required for 50% loss of the \ninitially applied pesticide. Sorption was determined by equilibrating soil samples with \nan aqueous solution at a single initial concentration of the pesticide (10 mg a.s. kg-1 \nsoil). The relationship between sorbed amounts and those present in solution was \n6 \ncalculated. The methodology for degradation and sorption studies is described in more \ndetail by Beulke et al. (2002). \n \n2.2 Experimental results \n2.2.1 Variability in soil and pesticide properties \n \nCoefficients of variation for soil properties measured in the first experimental season are \ngiven in Table 2. \n \nTen soil samples were taken in the first experimental season from 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm \nand 20-30 cm depth within the areas of lysimeter extraction and analysed for organic \ncarbon contents. A further set of six samples was taken from 30-40 cm and 40-50 cm \ndepth. Results showed a considerable variability of organic carbon contents within the \nareas of lysimeter extraction. Coefficients of variation for the sandy Wick soil ranged \nfrom 8.3 to 18.8% depending on the soil depth (Table 2). Similar results were found for \nthe Hodnet clay loam where coefficients of variation for organic carbon contents ranged \nfrom 9.4 to 18.2%. Water contents at a range of water tensions were determined for \nsamples from the Wick and Hodnet soils. Samples were taken at six points within the \narea of lysimeter extraction in 10-cm increments up to 50 cm depth. Coefficients of \nvariation were between 1.8 and 15.0% for the Wick soil and between 2.2 and 16.1% for \nthe Hodnet soil.  \n \nIn the second experimental season, the variability of soil properties was investigated by \ntaking topsoil samples close to the point of lysimeter extraction (14 samples per soil \n7 \ntype). Coefficients of variation for the Wick soil were 11.5% for organic carbon \ncontents, 9.8% for bulk density, 6.8% for the water content at saturation and 6.2% for \nthe water content at -5 kPa. Variability in the Hodnet soil was somewhat smaller with \ncoefficients of variation of 7.5% for organic carbon contents, 4.5% for bulk density, \n3.2% for the water content at saturation and 5.2% for the water content at -5 kPa. \n \nSorption and degradation of isoproturon was determined for 10 samples taken from each \nsite at the time of lysimeter extraction. Figure 1 shows Box-and-Whisker plots of Kd \nvalues (sorption coefficients) and DT50 values at 15oC and -33 kPa for the two soils. \n \nKd values in the Wick soil ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 ml g-1. The herbicide was more \nstrongly sorbed in the Hodnet soil with Kd values between 1.7 and 2.1 ml g-1. A large \nvariability in the degradation of isoproturon was found for the Hodnet soil where DT50 \nvalues in the ten samples ranged from 8.5 to 25.5 days. Degradation in the Wick soil \nvaried to a lesser extent (DT50 values 7.5 to 17.6 days). \n \n2.2.2 Variability in pesticide leaching \nA characterisation of radioactivity in leachate from the lysimeters was only possible for \na small proportion of samples and the measured radioactivity was fully assigned to \nisoproturon for the purposes of this modelling study. Any breakdown products which \nmay have contributed to the observed levels of radioactivity were ignored. The data on \nisoproturon presented below should thus not be taken as absolute values, but rather as \nparent equivalents. \n \n8 \nFigure 2 shows concentration profiles of isoproturon in leachate from each of the seven \nreplicate lysimeters of the Wick series. Breakthrough curves for most cores were \nrelatively smooth except for one lysimeter where the concentration profile was of \nirregular shape and large concentrations were measured shortly after application, \nsuggesting an influence of preferential flow. Matrix flow was expected to be the \ndominant process in the sandy Wick soil, but potential preferential pathways in the form \nof vertical worm channels were found during extraction of the soil cores. A dye \n(Brilliant blue) was leached through selected lysimeters at the end of the experiment and \na large stained pore down to the bottom of the core was found in the lysimeter which \nexhibited an irregular flow pattern. This supports the assumption that the large initial \nconcentrations of isoproturon observed in leachate from this lysimeter result from \npreferential flow. \n \nConcentration profiles for the Hodnet soil clearly showed preferential movement of the \npesticide for two of the seven replicates with isoproturon detected early in the season \nand at a maximum concentration of 17.2 \u00b5g l-1 (Figure 2). Breakthrough curves were \nsmoother for the remaining five replicates. Soils of the Hodnet series are structured and \nprone to preferential flow. Hydraulic properties which determine the relative importance \nof preferential flow are spatially variable in this soil type. This is likely to be the main \nreason for the relatively large variability between replicate lysimeters. Differences in \npesticide degradation and sorption may have contributed to the observed differences in \nleaching through the seven cores. \n \nFigure 3 shows Box-and-Whisker plots for cumulative losses of isoproturon from the \nsandy loam (Wick series) and the clay loam (Hodnet series) 120 days after application \n9 \n(DAA). Total losses from the Wick lysimeters ranged from 0.025 to 0.204 mg\/m2 with a \ncoefficient of variation of 79%. Losses from the seven Hodnet soil cores were between \n0.035 and 0.393 mg\/m2 with a coefficient of variation of 61%. \n \n3. Probabilistic Modelling \nSoil and pesticide properties were initially averaged across the field and used as input \nfor the preferential flow model MACRO (Jarvis, 1994) to simulate isoproturon \nconcentrations in leachate from the two series of lysimeters. Version 4.1b of the model \n(August 1998) was used in this study. MACRO divides the soil pore system into the soil \nmatrix where flow is relatively slow and driven by convection and dispersion \n(micropore domain) and a region with preferential flow pathways which deliver water \nand solutes rapidly to depth (macropore domain). By varying the input parameters, the \nMACRO model can be set up to simulate a soil dominated by preferential flow, a soil \nwith no preferential flow at all or any combination of flow types between these two \nextremes. The main application of MACRO is to simulate flow through structured clay \nsoils where rapid movement of water and solutes through cracks and fissures is \nimportant. The model can also be applied to intermediate loam soils where earthworm \nand root channels may deliver water and solutes rapidly to depth. MACRO has been \nevaluated against a number of datasets on leaching of pesticides or non-interactive \nsolutes (Bergstr\u00f6m, 1996; Brown et al., 1998; Larsson and Jarvis, 1999). Although \ndiscrepancies from measured data are occasionally observed, the results are generally \npromising. Water and pesticide movement through structured heterogeneous clay soils \ncan be difficult to simulate consistently with MACRO (Vink et al., 1997; Armstrong et \nal., 2000; Beulke et al., 2001). However, similar results were found for the other models \ntested (CRACK-NP, LEACHP, PESTLA, PLM, SIMULAT, SWAT, VARLEACH). \n10 \nThis is due to the large spatial and temporal variability of influencing factors in such \nsoils and the inability of the models to represent all relevant controlling processes at the \npresent time. The simulation of water and pesticide movement through intermediate \nsoils is less challenging. MACRO showed a better match to data from a range of \nintermediate soils than models which do not consider preferential flow in work by \nBrown et al. (1999).  \n \nPesticide and soil properties are variable in space and time. Their spatial variability was \ninvestigated in this study by taking samples close to the points of lysimeter extraction. \nExisting probabilistic approaches allow incorporation of this variability into the \nmodelling and quantification of the uncertainty in model output arising from the \nuncertainty and variability in model input. The potential applicability of such \napproaches within regulatory risk assessments was evaluated.  \n \nThe following general approach was adopted. The parameterisation of MACRO was \nbased on measured information where possible. No calibration of the model was \nundertaken. Variables for probabilistic modelling were a priori selected on the basis of \nresults from model sensitivity analyses. Probability density functions representing the \nvariability of pesticide and soil properties were assigned on the basis of expert \njudgement and experimental information. A large number of values for key input \nparameters was generated and these were used to simulate the leaching of isoproturon \nthrough the Wick and Hodnet lysimeters. MACRO was run for each combination of \ninput parameters. The resulting distributions of model output (cumulative isoproturon \nload 120 DAA) were compared with measured losses of isoproturon and with those \n11 \nsimulated on the basis of a deterministic approach using a single set of average input \nparameters.  \n \nIn this study, Latin Hypercube sampling from distributions of model input parameters \nwas used in combination with the MACRO model. This aimed at demonstrating a \ntechnique which allows to incorporate uncertainty and variability into pesticide fate \nmodelling. The MACRO model was used as an example, but the technique can be \napplied equally well to any other pesticide leaching model. \n \n3.1 Selection of variables for probabilistic modelling \nResults from model sensitivity analyses for MACRO (Dubus and Brown, 2002) guided \nthe selection of variables for probabilistic modelling. The authors investigated the \nsensitivity of input parameters for MACRO and three other pesticide leaching models \nfor transport of two pesticides through the Wick and Hodnet soil. Results for a pesticide \nwith a DT50 value of 60 days at 8oC, a Koc value of 100 ml g-1 and a Freundlich \nexponent of 0.9 are shown in Figure 4. For comparison, average degradation and \nsorption characteristics of isoproturon in the Hodnet soil are: DT50 =18 days at 15oC; \nKoc = 98 ml g-1. In Figure 4, the fifteen parameters with the strongest influence on \nsimulated pesticide losses are ranked using a relative sensitivity index (MAROV) and \nalso grouped into broad classes of parameters. The larger the MAROV value for a given \nparameter, the greater its sensitivity. The calculation of MAROV indices is described in \ndetail by Dubus and Brown (2002).  \n \nFor the Wick soil, MACRO was found to be most sensitive to changes in sorption \nparameters (FREUND, ZKD) and degradation rates (DEG). In the Hodnet soil, leaching \n12 \nof the pesticide was more sensitive to changes in hydraulic parameters than to changes \nin the degradation rate or the sorption coefficient (Figure 4). TPORV (total porosity), \nZN (macropore tortuosity), XMPOR (boundary water content), KSM (boundary \nhydraulic conductivity) and ASCALE (aggregate half-width) were the soil hydraulic \nparameters with the strongest influence on leaching through this structured soil.  \n \nOn the basis of these results, probabilistic modelling of isoproturon leaching through the \nWick soil incorporated the variability of the DT50 and\/or Kd values of isoproturon. \nTwo probabilistic modelling exercises were carried out for the Hodnet soil. Initially, \nonly DT50 and\/or Kd values of isoproturon were varied. Thereafter, those hydraulic \nparameters for which measurements were available (TPORV and XMPOR) were varied \neither on their own or in combination with pesticide parameters.  \n \n3.2 Probabilistic modelling incorporating the variability in pesticide properties \n3.2.1 Attribution of statistical distributions to pesticide properties and statistical \nsampling \nTen soil samples were taken in the field within the area where lysimeters were extracted \nand degradation and sorption of isoproturon was determined in each sample. Although \nthis was useful for providing a first estimation of the variability of isoproturon \nbehaviour within this area, the sample size was too small to allow a robust attribution of \na distribution to the data. Only speculations could therefore be made. Basic statistics \nwere computed and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests were carried out to test for \nnormality of the distributions. Results suggested that out of the four populations \nexamined, only one had the potential to follow a normal law (DT50 values for the Wick \n13 \nsoil). The three remaining datasets (Kd in the Wick and Hodnet soils, DT50 values for \nthe Hodnet soil) were log-transformed and resulting data were tested for normality by \ngraphical means and using a KS test. These tests were negative. Other types of \ndistributions were not tested because the small number of observations would not have \nallowed any confidence to be assigned to the results. A pragmatic approach was \nfollowed instead. Sorption and degradation properties have been found to be either \nnormally (Elabd et al., 1986) or log-normally (Novak et al., 1997) distributed in the \nfield. It was decided to assign a normal distribution to pesticide properties in this \nprobabilistic modelling exercise, although a log-normal distribution could have also \nbeen selected. The normal distribution is intuitively easier to parameterise than its log-\ntransformed version. The arbitrary adoption of a normal distribution implies that the \nmost frequent value of a specific parameter is considered to be the mean of the \npopulation and that data are assumed to be symmetrical on each side of this value.  \n \nProbability density functions of the normal law are fully characterised by their mean \nand standard deviation. The mean and standard deviation were taken as those observed \nin the field for each input parameter. A total of 100 values were randomly sampled from \nthe statistical distributions. Sampling was restricted to the range defined by the mean \u00b1 \n1.96 x standard deviation in order to avoid the sampling of unrealistic values. For a \nnormal distribution, 95% of the values fall within this range.  \n \nMeasured DT50 values were corrected for moisture effects on degradation prior to their \nuse as model input. This was necessary because the reference moisture in MACRO is \nfixed to the water content at the boundary between the micropores and macropores \n(XMPOR). The DT50 values for the Wick and Hodnet soil measured at -33 kPa were \n14 \nadjusted to XMPOR using the equation implemented in the model (Jarvis, 1994). This \nresulted in DT50 values for the Wick soil of 6.0-14.0 days with an average of 9.3 days. \nDT50 values at XMPOR for the Hodnet soil ranged from of 8.2 to 24.7 days (average = \n18.0 days). Parameters for the statistical distributions are presented in Table 3. \n \nRandom sampling into statistical distributions was performed using the UNCSAM \npackage (Janssen et al., 1994) and a Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) scheme. LHS is \na stratified Monte Carlo sampling technique which allows the number of model runs to \nbe kept to a minimum (Helton, 1993). The SENSAN package (Doherty et al., 2002) was \nused to automatically generate input files for MACRO using the sampled values, run the \nmodel and record the appropriate model output.  \n \nThree separate cases were considered: \n1. The first case accounted for the variability of DT50 values alone. A total of 100 \nDT50 values were sampled from each of the distributions for the Wick and the \nHodnet soil. Sampled DT50 values were then combined with average Kd values for \neach of the two soils. MACRO simulations were performed for each of the 100 \ncombinations and the total load of isoproturon leached until 120 DAA was recorded.  \n2. An additional modelling exercise was carried out to account for only the variability \nof sorption coefficients of isoproturon. One hundred sorption coefficients were \nsampled within the limits given in Table 3 and these were combined with the \naverage DT50 value for each of the two soils.  \n3. In the third case, the variability of DT50 values and sorption coefficients was \nconsidered simultaneously and 100 combinations of DT50 and Kd values were \nsampled and used as model input. \n15 \n3.2.2 Results \nBox-and-Whisker plots of measured cumulative isoproturon losses between 0 and 120 \nDAA are compared with those of simulated losses following variation of pesticide input \nparameters for MACRO in Figure 5 (Wick soil) and Figure 6 (Hodnet soil). Isoproturon \nloads derived from deterministic modelling with MACRO on the basis of average \npesticide properties are indicated for comparison.  \n \nThe use of a range of DT50 values for the Wick soil caused a large variability of \nsimulated isoproturon loads with a coefficient of variation of 38% (Figure 5). The \nvariability in sorption coefficients resulted in a skewed distribution of isoproturon loads \nand the coefficient of variation of the model output was again 38%. Isoproturon loads \nfor the Wick soil covered a larger range when DT50 values and sorption coefficients \nwere varied simultaneously (CV = 58%). The range of simulated pesticide losses from \nthe Wick soil agreed relatively well with the range of data measured for the seven \nreplicate lysimeters (Figure 5). The simulated mean and median were, however, larger \nthan the measured values. Coefficients of variation for the observed losses of \nisoproturon (79%) were larger than those for the probabilistic modelling exercises (38-\n58%). It should be noted, however, that only seven measured values were available \ncompared with 100 model simulations.  \n \nProbabilistic modelling for the Wick soil showed that the incorporation of uncertainty in \npesticide degradation and sorption parameters will result in a considerable variability in \nsimulated pesticide behaviour. Results suggest that for this soil type the variability in \nmodel output will encompass a relatively large proportion of the variability at the site. \nThe contribution of additional factors not considered in this probabilistic analysis can, \n16 \nhowever, not be excluded. It should also be noted that experimental information on \npesticide leaching was available for seven soil cores only.  \n \nThe average simulated loss of isoproturon from the Hodnet lysimeters for the three \nprobabilistic modelling studies agreed well to the mean loss from the seven lysimeters \n(Figure 6). There was a relatively large difference between the variability in simulated \nleaching  (CV = 15-24%) and that of measured data (CV = 61%). This suggests that the \nincorporation of variability in the considered pesticide properties alone may not be \nappropriate to fully represent the variability in isoproturon leaching for this soil type. \nThe variability in physical properties found at the site may be an additional important \nfactor. This hypothesis was tested through additional probabilistic analyses for the \nHodnet soil to consider some of the uncertainty associated with soil hydraulic \nproperties.  \n \n3.3 Probabilistic modelling incorporating the variability in soil and pesticide \nproperties \n3.3.1 Attribution of statistical distributions to soil properties and statistical sampling \nThe five soil parameters with the strongest influence on leaching of a pesticide through \nthe Hodnet soil were TPORV, ZN, XMPOR, KSM and ASCALE in a sensitivity \nanalysis for MACRO by Dubus and Brown (2002; Figure 4). Probabilistic modelling of \nisoproturon leaching through the Hodnet soil incorporated the variability of those \nhydraulic parameters for which measurements were available (total porosity TPORV \nand boundary water content XMPOR). Soil parameters were varied on their own or in \ncombination with the DT50 value and Kd value of isoproturon.  \n17 \n The average porosity for each soil layer was derived from data measured in the first \nexperimental season (six water release curves were available per 9-cm or 10-cm soil \nlayer). A normal distribution was arbitrarily assigned to TPORV. The standard \ndeviation was set such that 95% of the data (mean \u00b1 1.96 x standard deviation) fell \nbetween the minima and maxima given in Table 4. This corresponded to a coefficient of \nvariation for TPORV of 5.1%. It should be noted that the selection of the distribution \ninfluences the results of the probabilistic exercise. An equal number of values will be \nsampled either side of the mean if a normal distribution is chosen. In contrast, \nlognormal distributions are skewed. There was a negligible difference in the goodness \nof fit of a normal or log-normal distribution to the 6 datapoints as indicated by the KS \ntest. However, the sample size was too small to allow a robust attribution of a \ndistribution to the data in this study.  \n \nXMPOR could not be varied independently because this would have resulted in \nunrealistic combinations of total porosity and boundary water content. Instead, it was \nassumed that the proportion of the total pore volume assigned to the micropore region \nwas normally distributed. These proportions were derived from measured water release \ncurves (water content at XMPOR \/ water content at 0 kPa). It was further assumed that \n95% of the values for this proportion fall between the boundaries given in Table 4. The \nrandom sampling of values for TPORV and its proportion assigned to the micropore \nregion (see below) resulted in coefficients of variation for XMPOR in the five soil \nlayers of 5.1 - 5.4%.  \n \n18 \nThe total range of possible values for each parameter was divided into sections of equal \nprobability and 350 combinations of TPORV and the fraction of total porosity assigned \nto XMPOR were sampled using Latin Hypercube Sampling. MACRO simulations were \ncarried out for each of these parameter combinations. Pesticide properties remained \nconstant for this modelling exercise. In an additional exercise, TPORV, XMPOR and \npesticide sorption and degradation parameters were varied simultaneously. The \ndistributions of pesticide parameters described in Section 3.2 were used for this purpose. \n \n3.3.2 Results \nFigure 7 compares Box-and-Whisker plots of cumulative isoproturon losses measured \nfor the Hodnet lysimeters with plots of simulated losses following variation of total \nporosity (TPORV) and the boundary water content (XMPOR), alone or in combination \nwith pesticide parameters. Simulated leaching of isoproturon varied to a relatively large \nextent when the variability in TPORV and XMPOR was taken into account (Figure 7). \nThe range of simulated pesticide losses from the Hodnet soil arising from the variability \nof TPORV and XMPOR (0.022 mg m-2 to 0.573 mg m-2) agreed relatively well with the \nrange of data measured for the seven replicate lysimeters. The coefficient of variation \n(52%) was somewhat smaller than the observed variability (CV = 61%). The maximum \nsimulated isoproturon loss increased to 0.819 mg m-2 when pesticide properties were \nincluded in the probabilistic modelling exercise. The coefficient of variation of \nisoproturon loads (63%) resulting from the variability in soil and pesticide properties \nwas somewhat larger than that attributed to variability in hydraulic properties alone and \nagreed well to the observed variability. \n \n19 \nThe results confirm that simulations of pesticide leaching through structured soils are \nsensitive to changes in TPORV and XMPOR. These parameters are uncertain and have \na large influence on model predictions in structured soils and should, therefore, be \nincluded in probabilistic modelling for such soils. This is expected to result in a large \nvariability in predicted pesticide leaching.  \n \nSoil properties which showed the strongest influence on simulated pesticide losses from \nthe Hodnet soil in sensitivity analyses by Dubus and Brown (2002) were selected for \nthis study. The variability of simulated isoproturon losses arising from the variation of \nthese parameters was similar to the variability in results for the seven replicate Hodnet \nlysimeters. It should be noted, however, that the range and distribution of model output \nstrongly depends on the assignment of plausible ranges and distributions to each of the \ninput parameters.  \n \n4. General discussion \nThe two soils studied within the current investigations were selected to contrast in their \nproperties and this led to large differences in the results obtained. Movement of water \nand solute through the coarse-textured Wick soil appears to have been dominated by \nmatrix flow, although a contribution from preferential flow was apparent in some of the \nsoil cores. Here, a simple approach involving the variation of the DT50 and Kd values \nfor isoproturon was sufficient to account for the observed variability in cumulative \nleaching. The Hodnet soil is more structured and preferential flow had a significant \ninfluence on pesticide movement. The variation assigned to selected pesticide properties \n20 \nin this study could not match observed variability in cumulative leaching and it was \nnecessary to incorporate variability in soil properties.  \n \nSimplified investigations were undertaken where only the top few most sensitive model \ninputs were varied. For both soils, such constrained probabilistic approaches were \nsufficient to match or exceed the variability observed between the seven replicate \nlysimeters. This seems promising although it should be noted that the variability at the \nsite may not be fully characterised by this relatively small number of replicates.  \n \nThe results suggest that full probabilistic treatments accounting for all input parameters \nand possible sources of uncertainty as well as uncertainties inherent in model \nassumptions may significantly over-estimate variability. Exclusion of part of the \nuncertainty from the modelling process does not mean that it does not exist, but rather \nthat modelling is likely to be less stable than reality and that more useable results may \nbe obtained through a constrained approach. There are several reasons for the \ndiscrepancy between variability in modelling results and that observed in the field. \nUncertainty in model input is not only caused by environmental variability (e.g. soil \nproperties, climate, crop growth), but also by uncertainties related to experimental, \nanalytical and estimation procedures used to obtain model parameters (e.g. \ndetermination of degradation parameters; Dubus et al., 2003).  \n \nThe parameters needing to be varied to match observed behaviour for both soils were \ncorrectly identified by the sensitivity analysis undertaken for MACRO (Dubus and \nBrown, 2002). This gives credence to results from the two studies and highlights the \nimportance of using sensitivity analysis within the design of probabilistic approaches. \n21 \nProbabilistic modelling which considers the uncertainty in a small number of selected \nparameters relies on the assumption that the model is capable of describing the situation \nat hand. The simulation of the leaching of pesticides in soils prone to preferential flow \nrepresents a significant challenge to modellers. For these soils, the consideration of \nuncertainty in the few most sensitive parameters might not be enough to account for the \nuncertainty in the modelling. This issue needs to be investigated further. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was funded by the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \n(DEFRA) under contract PL0523.
