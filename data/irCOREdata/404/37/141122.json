Artificial fluorescent particles designed to mimic the size\nand density of organic slurry particles were found to move off the grassland via inter-flow\n(surface + lateral through flow) and drain-flow. Where both pathways were present the\ndrains carried the greater number of particles. The results of the natural fluorescence and\n\u03b413C of water samples were inconclusive. Natural fluorescence was higher from slurry\namended lysimeters than from zero slurry lysimeters, however, a fluorescence decay\nexperiment suggested that no slurry signal should be present given the time between\nslurry application and the onset of drainage. The \u03b413C values of >0.7\u00b5m and <0.7\u00b5m\nmaterial in drainage were varied and unrelated to Q. The mean value of >0.7\u00b5m \u03b413C in\nwater from the drain-flow pathways were higher from the lysimeter which had received\nnaturally enriched maize slurry compared to the lysimeter which received grass slurry\nindicating a contribution of slurry derived material. Values of <0.7\u00b5m \u03b413C from the same\npathway however produced counter intuitive trends and may indicate that different\nfractions of the slurry have different \u03b413C values.\nIntroduction\nWith the recent introduction of legislation and policy aimed at improving aquatic ecology\nand water quality in river basins (e.g. EU Water Framework Directive), attention is\nincreasingly focusing on efforts to decrease inputs of pollutants into surface waters (i.e.\nrivers and lakes) and groundwater. Agricultural areas typically represent a large\nproportion of the land surface in many countries, and in Europe and North America this\nland often receives large quantities of agricultural amendments such as inorganic\nfertilizers or managed animal manure (e.g. farmyard manure (FYM) and slurry) which are\napplied to improve plant production. However with the intensification of farming, and\nsubsequent increases in stocking densities, managed manures are often applied to land in\nexcess. These organic amendments can have a significant impact if released into river\nsystems as they contain high levels of nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus\n(P) and have a high biological oxygen demand which can lead to a decrease in river oxygen\nlevels (Hooda et al., 2000). Increases in plant nutrients in aquatic systems can lead to the\neutrophication of an ecosystem with a host of associated detrimental effects (Conley et\nal., 2009). The application of these amendments to land has long been implicated by\nstudies as a source of aquatic diffuse N and P pollution (Heathwaite, 1997; Smith et al.,\n1998; McDowell and Sharpley, 2001; Smith et al., 2002; McDowell et al., 2007). However,\nfew studies actually provide evidence of a direct link between the organic sources of\npollution applied to land and the occurrence of pollutants in water bodies (Haygarth et al.,\n2006). The potential to apply tracing techniques \u2013 particularly the simultaneous use of\nmultiple tracers \u2013 to provide substantive evidence for the nature of this link at the field\nscale has previously been highlighted (Granger et al., 2007). To provide proof of concept, a\ntracer study was undertaken on 1ha intensively managed, drained and undrained,\ngrassland lysimeters in the south west U.K. Three tracing techniques were chosen: i)\nnatural abundance carbon (C) isotopes, ii) labelled synthetic particles, and iii) natural\nfluorescence.\nIt is believed that the use of stable C isotopes at natural abundance should be able\nto provide evidence for the movement of slurry derived C from land into drainage waters.\nA previous unreported study undertaken at the small plot scale had shown that the\namount of slurry-derived organic C lost in drainage varied from 10 to 75%, with the\nmaximum loss occurring shortly after slurry application during a rainfall event.\nFurthermore, slurry derived C continued to be detectable in drainage waters for over 2\nmonths, long after pollutants had returned to pre-slurry levels (Bol, personal\ncommunication). The principles behind the stable C isotope tracing technique have been\ndescribed in detail elsewhere (Amelung et al., 1999; Bol et al., 2000; Dungait et al., 2005).\nIn short, all grasslands in the U.K. are C3 systems (\u03b413C about \u201326\u2030). Cattle over-wintered\non silage produced from this herbage produce a slurry of similar enrichment while cattle\nover-wintered on a C4 plant-based silage produce an isotopically higher slurry (\u03b413C about\n\u201313\u2030) (Glaser et al., 2001). Thus, any increase in the \u03b413C signal of C present in the\ndrainage water leaving a C3 lysimeter which receives C4 slurry, when compared to a C3\nlysimeter which receives C3 slurry, can be attributed to the presence of the C4 slurry. A\nlysimeter receiving C3 slurry is used as a control rather than a zero-slurry lysimeter to\naccount for any differences in the soil biogeochemical processes due to the presence of\nslurry and it is assumed that the processes that affect both C3 and C4 slurries are the same.\nBy examining the \u03b413C of both particulates and filtrates in the drainage waters, this\ntechnique may be extended to provide evidence for differing loss processes.\nThe use of labelled synthetic particles has been previously used in maritime and\nterrestrial aquatic environments (Marsh et al., 1991; Marsh et al., 1993; McComb and\nBlack, 2005). These particles typically comprise a polymer combined with a fluorescent\ndye manufactured with a density matched to that of the particles which are being\nmimicked. To an extent, similar size distributions may also be achieved by initial sieving,\nwith further control over particle size being applied at the sample analysis phase. Thus\nparticles of roughly equivalent size and density to particles typically present in slurry can\nbe created and subsequently added to and mixed with slurry before its application to the\ngrassland lysimeters. The presence, or absence, of these particles in water draining the\nlysimeters is a direct indication that particulate material applied with the slurry is able to\nmove, and has moved from the system.\nRecent advances in fluorescence spectroscopy have enabled rapid automated\ncollection of fluorescence intensity data across a wide range of excitation and emission\nwavelengths. The observed centres of fluorescence in river water samples correspond to\nthose produced by known fluorophores, predominantly the amino acids tryptophan and\ntyrosine, and high molecular weight organic molecules, such as humic and fulvic acids.\nHudson et al. (2007) provide an excellent review of both the phenomenon of natural\nfluorescence and its measurement. Farm wastes have also been analysed for their\nfluorescent properties and have been found to have very high intensities of tyrosine-like\nand tryptophan-like fluorescence and high ratios of these to fulvic\/humic-like fluorescence\ncompared to stream waters (Baker, 2002).This suggests that pollution of waters by these\nagricultural wastes could leave a distinct fluorescence signature reflecting both the source\nof the dissolved organic matter and its concentration.\nThis combination of tracers may therefore be able to provide both evidence of a\ndirect connection between pollutant losses and organic amendments applied to\nagricultural grassland but also to discriminate between dissolved and particulate slurry\nfractions. The aim of this paper is to present the results from the field experiment in terms\nof both the evidence provided by the tracers for direct slurry losses into drainage waters\nand to provide an assessment of the tracing techniques used.\nExperimental\nSite\nThe study was sited on the field-scale lysimeters (1ha) of the Rowden experimental\nresearch platform (RERP) in Devon, Southwest England (National Grid Reference: SX\n650995). The experimental site is maintained as permanent grassland and is grazed by\nbeef heifers at stocking densities of approximately four livestock units per hectare in order\nto manage sward height during the months of June to September. The soil is a clayey non-\ncalcareous pelostagnogley of the Hallsworth series (Dystic Gleysol, FAO; HOST class 24\n(Boorman et al., 1995)), overlying clay shales of the Crackington Formation (Culm\nmeasures) and the site slopes between 5 and 10% westwards. For details of soil properties\nsee Scholefield et al (1993) and Armstrong and Garwood (1991). The annual rainfall at this\nsite averages 1055mm, where the majority falls between October and March. As a\nconsequence of the virtually impermeable clay layer below 30cm the soil remains\nwaterlogged for much of the winter period. Half of the lysimeters at the RERP have been\nagriculturally drained while the other half has no drainage installed. Lysimeters in which\nno drainage has been installed are dependent upon natural drainage via surface-flow and\nlateral through-flow pathways, and are termed \u2018undrained\u2019 (Figure 5.1a). Lysimeters which\nhave drainage installed are termed \u2018drained\u2019 and have mole drains at a depth of 55cm\nwhich are intercepted by gravel filled trenches with 85cm deep permanent pipe drains\n(Figure 5.1b). All the lysimeters have perimeter gravel filled ditches to a depth of 30cm\nwhich collect any surface runoff plus any lateral through-flow (combined referred to as\ninter-flow). The flow is channelled through 45\u02da V-notch weirs. The drained lysimeters have\nadditional and separate V-notch weirs for measuring water that flows through the\ndrainage system (termed drain-flow) (Figure 5.1b). The stage height (h) of both inter-flow\nand drain-flow were measured using solar powered Starlevel flow sensors on a 5 minute\ntime-step with data recorded by Campbell radio loggers and subsequently transmitted via\nradio modem to a central computer. To convert h to discharge (Q) stage-discharge\nrelationships were produced for each weir, including estimates of the errors involved in\nthe calibration (Bilotta et al., 2008). These were used to produce hydrographs with\nassociated uncertainty bands (Qmax and Qmin) through a technique developed by Kreuger\net al (2008). Rainfall at the site was measured using a tipping-bucket rain gauge (Rainwise,\nBar Harbor, ME), which recorded the total number of tips min-1 (each tip equivalent to\n0.254mm rainfall).\nFigure 5.1. The hydrological pathways of the undrained (a) and drained (b) lysimeters at the\nRowden Experimental Research Platform (adapted from Granger et al.(2008)). The location of\nthe lysimeters used for each tracer application is presented in (c).\nExperimental Design\nThe experiment began on the 18th April 2006. Prior to this, slurry was sourced from two\nlocal farms where cattle were over-wintered on a diet of either ryegrass (Lolium perenne\nL, a C3 plant with a \u03b413C value of about \u201326\u2030) or maize (Zea mays L, a C4 plant with a \u03b413C\nvalue of about \u201313\u2030) based silage. After collection and prior to application the slurries\nwere stored in two slurry mini-stores so that they could be well mixed. Each store was\nused exclusively for the storage and mixing of either the C3 or the C4 slurry to avoid cross\ncontamination.\nPrior to mixing and application to the lysimeters, the C4 slurry received a dose of\nfluorescent tracer particles. These were manufactured by Environmental Tracing Systems\nLtd, Helensburgh, U.K. with a particle size distribution (PSD) based on the PSD of an initial\ntest slurry (Figure 5.2a). This data showed a bimodal distribution with one peak between\n27-37\u00b5m. The artificial fluorescent particles were manufactured to match this peak within\nthis size range (Figure 5.2b) and a density of 1.15g cm-3 so as to be comparable with the\norganic particles within the slurry. The PSD data for the raw tracer particles (Figure 5.2b)\nshow a relatively large proportion of very fine particles below 2\u00b5m. Given that these were\nnot present in the slurry used as an initial guide, all particles below 2\u00b5m were discounted\nduring the analysis of any samples. Excluding the <2\u00b5m particles, the D50 of the tracer was\nabout 12\u00b5m with the main peak between 16-19\u00b5m. Analysis of the two stock solutions\nshowed that 4.4 x 1013 particles were applied per release. Mixing was accomplished\nthrough the pump and return of slurry out of, and back into the slurry towers using a\nconventional vacuum tanker. Tracer was then added to the slurry before further mixing\nwas undertaken.\nThe experimental design comprised six hydrologically-isolated lysimeters at the\nRERP consisting of three drained and undrained pairs. Two pairs received an application of\neither C3 or C4 slurry while the third pair received nothing (Figure 5.1c). The maximum\nrecommended application rate for UK grassland systems is 50m3 ha-1, however, due to\nenvironmental constraints at the RERP at the time of application only 21m3 ha-1 was\napplied. The C3 and C4 slurries were applied to the drained lysimeters on the 18th April,\nwhile application to the undrained lysimeters occurred one week later on the 25th April.\nSlurry was applied using a conventional vacuum tanker fitted with a splash plate in three\napplications starting with the third of the lysimeter furthest away from the access point.\nSlurry was remixed before each tanker load was removed from the slurry mini-stores. A\n10m margin was left around the edge of each lysimeter in order to prevent contamination\nof the surface drains in accordance with the \u2018Code of Good Agricultural Practice\u2019 (Defra,\n2002).\nFigure 5.2. Particle size distributions of a) initial test dairy slurry, b) the raw artificial fluorescent\ntracer particles and c) the maize slurries applied to drained and undrained lysimeters after the\naddition of the tracer particles.\nSampling\nSoil cores were collected from across the RERP to ascertain the \u03b413C of the total soil C\nprior to slurry application. Five points within four of the lysimeters at the RERP were used\nwhich included two of the lysimeters used in this study. At each point 10 cores (2.5cm\ndiameter) were taken to a depth of 7.5cm and these cores were then bulked.\nSub-samples of slurry were collected from each batch of slurry that was applied to\neach of the four lysimeters and stored in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C until analysis.\nSamples of drainage water were taken as follows: all V-notch weir systems were\nfitted with an internal stainless steel mixing plate below the drainage input to the weir.\nThe drainage flowing through the mixing plate was then sampled on hourly or sub-hourly\ntime-steps either using an automated sampler or through the collection of manual grab\nsamples. Sampling of drainage water commenced after the first rainfall event to initiate\ndrainage from the lysimeters. This occurred on the 19th May 2006, some 31 days after\nslurry application (Fig. 3). A further two rainfall events were sampled, occurring on the 21st\nand 24th of May, and these three events are referred to as events 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\nEvents 1 and 3 were sampled using automated samplers while event 2 was sampled\nmanually by taking hourly grab samples. This was undertaken as during event 1 it was\nfound that at low flows the auto-samplers were unable to collect sufficient sample for\nanalysis. Event 3 was sufficiently large for resumption of automated sampling. Auto-\nsamplers were set to sample using the same atomic clock time as the flow loggers.\nSamples were stored in a refrigerated environment in 1000ml polyethylene bottles.\nIn addition, temporal changes in the natural fluorescence signal of the slurry were\nmonitored by applying slurry to a compartmented tray of a sterile medium (vermiculite) at\nthe same rate (i.e. depth) as to the lysimeters. The use of a sterile medium was chosen so\nas not to introduce additional sources of fluorescence. There was no attempt to simulate\nsoil processes. Four replicate sub-samples and two controls were collected each week and\nextracted using de-ionised water for analysis.\nAnalysis\nChemistry. Slurry samples were analysed for total solids by drying a pre-weighed\nsample in an oven at 100\u00baC and subsequently re-weighing until a constant weight is\nobtained. Organic matter was determined though weight loss on ignition at 500\u00baC of the\ndried slurry.\nWithin 24 hours of arrival at the laboratory, drainage waters had sub-samples for\ntotal phosphorus (TP) analysis transferred to polypropylene autoclavable bottles.\nConcentration of TP was then determined though an acid persulphate digestion using a\nmethod described by Eisenreich et al. (1975). Absorbance was measured colourimetrically\non a spectrophotometer (Cecil Instruments, Cambridge, UK) calibrated by standards\nprepared fresh on the day of analysis. Concentrations of suspended solids (SS) and volatile\nsolids (VS) were determined through vacuum filtration, and subsequent drying at 105\u00b0C\nfor at least 1 hour, of a known sample volume through a pre-weighed GF\/F filter paper\n(Whatman), with particle size retention of 0.7\u00b5m. Filter papers were then heated to 500\u00b0C\nfor at least 30 minutes to determine the total residual ash. The difference between SS and\ntotal ash is considered to represent VS (UK Standing Committee of Analysts, 1980).\nArtificial fluorescent particles. Particle size distributions for both the raw tracer\nparticles and tracer particles mixed with slurry were measured using a LISST 100 laser\ndiffraction particle size analyser (Sequoia Scientific, USA). In both cases, ten analyses were\nundertaken and a mean result generated. Water samples collected from the lysimeters\nwere agitated and sonified to disaggregate and suspend any solids and tracer particles. A\nmeasured volume, between 5 and 25ml depending on turbidity, of the sample was then\nfiltered through a 0.45\u00b5m cellulose nitrate filter paper (Whatman). The filter paper was\ncarefully transferred using forceps from the filter housing to a labelled microscope slide.\nEach slide was then analysed manually using a specially modified scanning fluorescent\nmicroscope (Leica, Germany). The total counts for the measured volume were then\nconverted to tracer counts per ml (cts ml-1). Replicate analyses were carried out on 15% of\nthe samples analysed with the results indicating less than 9% error on all samples.\nPrior to the release of the tracer particles some raw slurry samples and\nbackground water samples were collected from the RERP to determine whether there was\nany background fluorescence. While some weakly fluorescent particles were present in\nthese samples, likely to be either inorganic minerals and\/or biological material, they did\nnot interfere with the very much brighter fluorescent yellow particles applied due to the\ndifferent excitation and emission wavelengths.\nNatural fluorescence. Sub-samples of drainage water were taken from the ISCO\nsample bottles in acid-washed brown glass bottles and kept in cool, dark conditions.\nSamples were analysed at room temperature and before analysis, samples were filtered\nusing pre-ashed GF\/C glass fibre filters (Whatman) with particle size retention of 1.2\u00b5m.\nThe fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Varian Cary Eclipse\nfluorescence spectrophotometer fitted with a Xenon flash lamp using slit widths of 5nm,\nan integration time of 12.5ms and voltage of 725V. Excitation wavelengths from 240 to\n400nm (in steps of 5nm) and emission wavelengths from 280 to 500nm (in steps of 2nm)\nwere used to generate excitation\/emission matrices (EEM). The absorbance of each\nsample was measured in a 1cm cuvette on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer at 1nm\nintervals from 200 to 800nm. Samples with an absorbance value of >0.02cm-1 at 650nm\nwere omitted from the analysis as this was indicative of inefficient filtering. Samples which\nhad an absorbance of 0-0.02cm-1 had their absorbance corrected using the long-\nwavelength scatter-correction method of Blough et al (1993). Raw fluorescence data was\nthen corrected for lamp output and for instrument sensitivity following manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Haines, personal communication). Inner-filtering corrections, calculated from\nthe corrected absorbance data using the method of Lackowicz (1983) were then applied.\nThe fluorescence data were finally converted to Raman units using the method of Lawaetz\nand Stedmon (2009).\nFollowing investigations using known mixtures of test solutions prepared with\nultra-pure water and DL-Tyrosine, L-Tryptophan, IHSS Suwannee River Fulvic Acid\nStandard II and Humic Acid Standard II, indices representing tryptophan-like and\nfulvic\/humic-like fluorescence were calculated as the mean fluorescence intensity over\nthe following ranges:\nTryptophan Index (TI): Excitation 265-285nm\/Emission 346-354nm\nFulvic\/Humic Index (FI): Excitation 325-375nm\/Emission 450-500nm.\nThis provides a ratio of TI:FI. This ratio is typically >2 for slurry and <1 in drainage waters in\nthe absence of slurry (Naden et al, 2010). Thus, slurry losses should be identifiable in the\nenrichment of the TI:FI ratio. Where results are presented as means, two standard errors\nare presented in parenthesis.\nIsotopic. Bulked soil cores were sieved through a 2mm sieve to remove large stones and\norganic fragments before being dried overnight at 30\u00b0C to a constant weight and ground\ninto a fine powder. Slurry sub-samples were dried to a constant weight in an oven at\n100\u00b0C before being milled to a fine powder. Drainage samples were collected and\ndelivered to the laboratory within 24 hours of being sampled. They were then refrigerated\nat 5\u00b0C until ready for preparation. Samples were subject to vacuum filtration through pre-\ncombusted (500\u00b0C), washed and dried 0.7\u03bcm glass fibre filters (GF\/F, Whatman). The\nresultant filtrate was then frozen and freeze dried prior to analysis. Filter papers upon\nwhich >0.7\u00b5m particulate material was collected were dried in an oven at 105\u00b0C and\nstored individually in airtight bags and placed in a desiccator until ready for analysis.\nTotal C (TC) and 13C content was determined by dry combustion on a Carlo Erba NA\n1500 elemental analyser connected to an automated continuous flow ANCA 20\/20SL\nsystem (Europa, Crewe, UK). Prepared soil and slurry samples were weighed into 8 x 5mm\ntin capsules and combusted using 25ml of O2. Samples of particulate material on glass\nfibre filter papers were cut to fit inside 10 x 10mm tin capsules and combusted in the\nelemental analyser via a large bore auto-sampler (AS128) using a 50ml oxygen loop.\nDespite the 10 x 10mm capsule being able to hold significantly more sample than an 8 x\n5mm capsule, the actual amounts of sample C were still found to be low. To test the\nprecision of the mass spectrometer with small amounts of C, a series of 63 flours (42.2% C;\n-26.4\u2030 \u03b413C) from 5mg down to 0.25mg (i.e. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.25) were used where\neach weight was weighed to within \u00b1 5% of the target weight. Sample data was\nstatistically adjusted based on the exponential curves generated by results up to 5mg\nflour. Freeze dried <0.7\u03bcm filtrates were also weighed into 10 x 10mm tin capsules and\ncombusted using 50ml of O2, however in this case sufficient sample C was supplied to not\nwarrant statistical adjustment of the data.\nGround wheat flour referenced against CaCO3 (NBS-19, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)\nwas used as a calibration standard. The natural abundance values were expressed as \uf064\nvalues, which represents the ratios of 13C\/12C relative to the international VPDB standard.\nThe \uf06413C values (per mil) are defined as:\n\uf06413C = [(atom % 13Csample - atom % 13CVPDB) \/ atom % 13CVPDB] \uf0b4 1000\nInternal quality controls were included with samples during analysis comprising no\nless than 10% of the total number of samples and drift correction was made against\ninternal standards during the run. Replication of samples was typically better than 0.8\u2030\nfor GF\/F particulate samples and 1\u2030 for freeze-dried filtrates with mean values of 0.1\n(\u00b10.2) and 0.1 (\u00b10.5) respectively (two standard errors are presented in parenthesis).\nResults and discussion\nHydrological response\nThree storms were monitored during the period 19th- 26th May 2006 which generated\nhydrographs from the nine hydrological pathways contained within the six paired\nlysimeters. Due to a logger failure, discharge data from the zero slurry and maize slurry\nlysimeters was not recorded from 22nd May until the end of the study. The Q record from\nthe grass slurry lysimeters was unaffected. To estimate the missing Q record for this time\nperiod Q has been taken from other lysimeters at the RERP site which have been shown to\nbehave in a hydrologically similar fashion. These lysimeters were selected by visual\ncomparison of the hydrographs and assessment of the monthly flow statistics recorded\nfrom all lysimeters compared to those with missing data over the period March \u2013 May\n2006.\nThe amounts of rainfall leading to the Q events sampled were 13, 7 and 14mm\noccurring on the 19th, 21st and 24th May respectively. The previous month, during which\nslurry had been applied to the lysimeters, had been unusually dry having received just\n18mm rainfall compared to the mean April rainfall of 68mm. For the month of May, up to\nthe 19th, 30mm of rainfall had fallen which was still lower than average for the time of\nyear. By the time of drainage caused by event 1 on the 19th May occurred the soil\nmoisture deficit (SMD) for the site, as calculated by the Penman equation (Monteith,\n1980), was approximately 25mm. This deficit explains why a rainfall event of 13mm over 6\nhours did not produce significant Q for event 1. By event 2 on the 21st May the SMD had\nbeen reduced to about 4mm, however the relatively small amount of rainfall that caused\nit also meant that Q was low from the lysimeters. However, by event 3 on the 24th May\nthe soil had no SMD and the 14mm of rainfall that fell at the site caused Q to be\nsignificantly greater than event 1.\nThe hydrological response of the lysimeters is typical of this site and of other clay\nsoil sites both with and without mole drainage (Trafford and Rycroft, 1973; Harris et al.,\n1984; Armstrong and Garwood, 1991). Discharge responds rapidly to the onset of rainfall\nforming characteristically peaky hydrographs, especially from the undrained lysimeters.\nWhere mole drains have been installed, one could expect the drainage pathway to carry\nthe greater proportion of storm water (Harris et al., 1984; Armstrong and Garwood, 1991).\nHowever, should the drainage system not operate efficiently through collapse of the\nmoles the peaky drain-flow hydrograph would be attenuated while the inter-flow pathway\nwould carry a greater percentage of the total drainage (Armstrong and Garwood, 1991).\nDuring this study, while drain-flow from the lysimeters remained peaky, the hydrographs\nare more smoothed in comparison to the inter-flow hydrographs. Furthermore, the\nvolume of water carried by the drain-flow pathway was approximately equal to that of the\ninter-flow (Bilotta et al., 2008).\nChemical response\nA summary of the chemical data for each lysimeter and hydrological pathway for the three\nmonitored drainage events is presented in Table 5.1. This data shows that there was\nconsiderable variation in TP concentrations between events, slurry treatments and\ndrainage status of the lysimeters with no consistent treatment effect evident. The mean\nconcentrations of TP from the zero slurry undrained lysimeters were 146, 540 and 247\u00b5g l-\n1 for events 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Mean concentrations from slurry amended undrained\nlysimeters were higher during events 1 and 3, but lower during event 2. Mean\nconcentrations of TP from the drained lysimeters were always higher in the drain-flow\nthan the inter-flow. Concentrations in both pathways were also found to be higher from\nthe zero slurry lysimeter compared to both the slurry amended lysimeters during events 1\nand 2 although during event 3 concentrations were higher in the drain-flow of both the\nslurry amended lysimeters.\nSuspended sediment concentrations also showed cross-site variation with no\ndistinct event or slurry treatment effects. Mean event concentrations from the zero slurry\nundrained lysimeters were 78, 185 and 51mg l-1 while from the grass slurry amended\nlysimeter they were 44, 38 and 90mg l-1 and from the maize slurry amended lysimeter\n116, 78 and 45mg l-1. Mean concentrations from the drained lysimeters showed a similar\nlack of event or slurry effect although concentrations were typically higher in the inter-\nflow than in the drain-flow for any given lysimeter. Concentrations of VS also showed no\ndistinct event or slurry treatment effect although as with SS mean concentrations tended\nto be slightly higher in the inter-flow than the drain-flow. The composition of the SS is\ntypically mineral with maximum mean VS from the zero slurry lysimeter of 24% from the\nundrained and 26\/24% from the drain-flow\/inter-flow pathways of the drained lysimeters.\nThe proportion of VS was generally higher in lysimeters which received slurry compared to\nthose which did not for any given event, with the drain-flow of the drained lysimeters\nhaving a larger percentage of VS to SS compared to the inter-flow.\nThe highest concentrations of SS and TP typically coincide with or occur just before\npeak Q and then decrease with decreasing Q as previously described by Bilotta et al.\n(2008). The concentrations reported here are comparable with those reported previously\nduring a more comprehensive study of SS and TP from zero slurry lysimeters at this site\n(Bilotta et al., 2008). The number of significant correlations between SS and TP increase\nthrough events 1 to 3 but show no link to drainage status of the lysimeter, the\nhydrological pathway or the application of slurry (Table 5.1). During event 1 there were\nvirtually no significant relationships while all pathways in event 3 show highly significant\ncorrelations. This perhaps indicates that the size of the drainage event maybe more\nimportant in SS and TP mobilisation rather than the drainage status of the grassland and\nthat the soil, not the slurry, was the dominant source of SS and TP.\nArtificial fluorescent particles\nThe PSD data for the slurries mixed with tracer is presented in Figure 5.2c and given the\nmuch smaller volume of tracer added to a large volume of slurry the PSD data essentially\nreflects the slurry used for each study. The data indicate the maize slurry used to mix with\nthe fluorescent tracer was not the same as the slurry used as an initial guide. The maize\nslurry used for the undrained and drained plots show a mainly unimodal distribution with\na peak around 60-80\u00b5m and not a bi-modal distribution as the initial guide slurry had\nshown. The PSD data for the slurries applied to drained and undrained lysimeters show\ndifferences although given they were different batches and not collected at the same time\nthis is perhaps not surprising. The fluorescent tracer particles used tended to represent\nthe initial 40-50% of the slurry based on PSD data with more than 50% of the slurry\nconsisting of particles larger than the tracer used. The PSD data of the slurry tracer\nmixture also shows that both have an increase in the number of particles <2\u00b5m, a feature\nnot present in the initial test slurry. This is interpreted as purely a function of the addition\nof the tracer which has a high number of <2\u00b5m particles, which were excluded from\nanalysis.\nThe number of tracer particles lost from each pathway increased through events 1\nto 3 (Table 5.1); the mean number of particles lost during each event from the inter-flow\npathway of the undrained lysimeter was 1, 8 and 84cts ml-1, while a comparable response\nis also present in the drain-flow of the drained lysimeter (2, 23 and 90cts ml-1). While\nthere are no data for event 1 from the inter-flow pathway of the drained lysimeter, there\nis a marked increase in tracer particle numbers in event 3 compared with event 2,\nhowever the numbers of particles lost in events 2 and 3 are notably lower from this\npathway than from the other two pathways (0 and 58cts ml-1), particularly during event 2.\nDuring event 1 no relationship between tracer particles and Q was observed in the\nundrained lysimeter, however a significant positive relationship (r7 = 0.83, p<0.01) occurs\nin the drain-flow from the drained lysimeter. Similarly during event 2 no relationship was\npresent between tracer particles and Q in the inter-flow from either lysimeter; although\ntracer particle numbers had increased compared to event 1 from the undrained lysimeter\nand were in turn greater than those from the drained lysimeter inter-flow pathway. No\nsignificant relationship was found between particle tracer number and Q from the drain-\nflow pathway during event 2; however the number of particles lost were greatest from\nthis pathway during this event. As event 3 Q from these two lysimeters is interpolated Q\nand not true Q from these lysimeters no statistical analysis of Q v tracer particles has been\nundertaken, however a clear trend is apparent.

Therefore the\ndata presented here is restricted to storm 2 (Table 5.1.) for which the period between\nsampling to analysis was <3days.\nSpatial sampling in a nearby first order catchment has shown that drainage waters\nnot directly contaminated by farm waste have TI:FI ratios of 0.3 to 0.4; at the\nRERPsubsequent sampling of non-slurry affected lysimeters gave mean TI:FI ratios of 0.45\n(\u00b10.01). For the samples discussed here, the mean value of TI:FI in inter-flow from the zero\nslurry lysimeter was 0.37 (\u00b10.00) while mean values from the two lysimeters which received\nslurry were higher, one marginally so at 0.41 (\u00b10.01) while the other was much higher at\n0.80 (\u00b10.06). Similarly mean values recorded in the inter-flow of the drained lysimeters were\nthe same (0.47 (\u00b10.02)) or higher (0.59 (\u00b10.03)) from slurry-amended lysimeters compared\nto the zero slurry lysimeter (0.49 (\u00b10.1)). Mean values of TI:FI from the drain-flow appear to\nbe more consistently affected by the presence of slurry; the value from the zero slurry\nlysimeter was 0.41 (\u00b10.00), while values from the two slurry-amended lysimeters were 0.53\n(\u00b10.01) and 0.61 (\u00b10.02). This suggests some evidence for the loss of slurry-derived material\nin a dissolved phase during event 2. However, results from the tray experiment indicate that\nwithin 4-5 weeks much of the natural fluorescence signal from the slurry (TI and FI) has\nbeen lost and the results from the TI:FI are inconclusive.\nIsotopic response\nNo significant difference in the \u03b413C of the soil was found between lysimeters at the RERP\nand therefore a grand mean of \u201328.7\u2030 (\u00b1 0.2) is taken to represent the \u03b413C of the soil at\nthe site. Slurry was applied to the lysimeters at two distinct times, with the drained\nlysimeters receiving an application of grass and maize slurry one week before the undrained\nlysimeters. The \u03b413C of the grass slurries were \u201328.2\u2030 (\u00b1 0.3) and \u201327.3\u2030 (\u00b1 0.1) applied to\ndrained and undrained lysimeters respectively, while the maize slurries had \u03b413C values of \u2013\n18.9\u2030 (\u00b1 0.2) and \u201318.0\u2030 (\u00b1 0.2) having a higher \u03b413C value of ~9\u2030 which was less than\nreported elsewhere (Dungait et al., 2005).\n22\nSummary values of \u03b413C measured in material >0.7 and <0.7\u00b5m leaving the\nlysimeters are presented in Table 5.1. There was no overall significant relationships between\nthe \u03b413C of the <0.7 and >0.7\u00b5m fractions. Variation in \u03b413C values are greatest in the\n<0.7\u00b5m fraction compared to the >0.7\u00b5m fraction and both fractions show no clear trends\noccurring within individual storm events. There were also no clear trends in the \u03b413C of >0.7\nand <0.7\u00b5m fractions across the three events in the inter-flow of both the undrained and\ndrained lysimeters. However, due to auto-sampler failure no data from event one on the\nmaize slurry amended, and event 3 on the grass slurry amended drained lysimeters was\ncollected from this pathway on the drained lysimeters which makes it impossible delineate\ntrends. Values of \u03b413C from the drain-flow pathway of the drained lysimeters do however\nshow a consistent trend across all three events in both the grass and maize slurry amended\nlysimeters. Here values of \u03b413C in both >0.7 and <0.7\u00b5m material become lower with each\nsubsequent event (Figure 5.4). The trend is clearest in the >0.7\u00b5m material and less so in the\n<0.7\u00b5m fraction, which are strongly influenced by a few samples which have a far higher\n\u03b413C than the bulk of the data especially during event 1. This trend of lower values across\nsubsequent storms does not appear to be affected by the slurry treatment.\nTo establish what slurry derived organic material is leaving the lysimeters a\ncomparison between the \u03b413C of lysimeters that received grass slurry and naturally enriched\nmaize slurry should be made. To do this the mean value of \u03b413C (\u00b12 standard errors) from\nthe maize-slurry amended lysimeters during each event was taken and compared to the\nmean obtained from the grass-slurry amended lysimeters from the corresponding event and\npathway (Figure 5.4). The >0.7 and <0.7\u00b5m material obtained from the undrained lysimeter\nwere similar in that although there were apparent differences between grass and maize\nslurry treatments, there was no specific direction to the trends. A more pronounced trend\nwas observed in the \u03b413C of material derived from the drain-flow of the drained lysimeter.\nThe \u03b413C values of the >0.7\u00b5m fraction from the maize slurry lysimeter were always higher\nrelative to that from the grass slurry lysimeter. This increase was only markedly different\nduring events 2 and 3 with increases of 0.6\u2030 (\u00b10.20 Standard Error of the Difference (SED))\nand 0.9\u2030 (\u00b10.16 SED) respectively. The reverse was true of the \u03b413Cvalues of the <0.7\u00b5m\nmaterial which were higher from the grass slurry lysimeter relative to the maize slurry\nlysimeter; 2.1\u2030 (\u00b10.68 SED) and 3.2\u2030 (\u00b10.37 SED) for events 2 and 3 respectively.\nAssuming that the increase in \u03b413C of the >0.7\u00b5m particles was caused as a result of maize\n23\nslurry material becoming entrained in the drain-flow it is estimated that between 6% (\u00b12)\nand 10% (\u00b12) of this material originated from the slurry during events 2 and 3 respectively.\nWhat is less clear is why an unexpected and counter intuitive difference in \u03b413C\nvalues was present within the <0.7\u00b5m fraction derived during events 2 and 3. We have no\nsimple explanation for this behaviour. The above observation may point to the fact that: (i)\nthe maize slurry was not homogeneously naturally enriched with the <0.7\u00b5m fraction being\nless labelled than the particulate <0.7\u00b5m fraction, (ii) the finer material of the surface\napplied <0.7\u00b5m fraction is predominantly held in the soil matrix at the soil surface, hence\nwhat is found in the drains is soil derived material which might have a different \u03b413C value\nbetween the two plots, (iii) the <0.7\u00b5m material contained forms of C that were significantly\ndifferent in their isotopic composition from that of C3 and C4 plant matter in the slurry; this\nmaterial may have been sourced from either, or both, of the slurries themselves or from the\nsoil\/soil-water system, or (iv) the differential fractionation in the soil of the <0.7 and >0.7\u00b5m\nmaterial differs between maize and grass slurry (Bol et al., 1999). All of these tentative\nsuggestions partly counter the assumption on which the natural abundance labelling\ntechnique is based (Balesdent and Mariotti, 1987) and require further investigation.\nFigure 5.4. Means \u03b413C (\u00b12 standard errors) of the <0.7 and >0.7\u00b5m material in waters from the\nundrained and drained lysimeters which received an application of either grass or maize based\nslurry.\n24\nAnalysis of the tracing approaches\nThe effectiveness of any tracer is wholly dependent on the degree to which it represents the\nmaterial that is being traced. All the tracers being applied to this study are novel to some\nextent; natural fluorescence signals at the field lysimeter scale have not been widely studied\nand reported previously, artificial fluorescent particles have been used previously but not in\nthe terrestrial environment, while natural abundance C isotopes have been used previously\nto assess the contribution of dung derived C to soil systems but not to aquatic ones nor at\nthis scale. To evaluate fully the effectiveness of the tracers being used we need to\nreconsider the strengths and limitations of the individual approaches.\nThe artificial fluorescent particles appear to have been a success in terms of\nimproving our understanding of the processes and pathways that organic material sourced\nfrom agricultural amendments follow. However, while these particles may mimic the size\nand density of a large fraction of slurry particles there are other aspects which remain\nuncertain such as the shapes of slurry particles and the nature of their surface charge (the\nparticles being manufactured with a positive charge). This obviously has implications for the\nway such particles may flocculate and move (Droppo, 2001), however unpublished data\nindicates that the particles do adsorb natural charge and therefore behave similarly when\nlooking at hydraulic and flocculation processes (J.K. Marsh, personal communication).\nFurthermore, the distribution and number of tracer particles mixed with the slurry may not\nrepresent the distribution and number of particles within the slurry, and counts of particles\nin drainage water were made irrespective of particle size. Therefore it is uncertain whether\nthe sizes of particles yielded in drainage are representative of the initial tracer as a whole or\nwhether one particular size range dominates. Additionally, to understand better the\nconsequences of slurry particle movement more information is needed on what pollutants\nare associated with these particles.\nWhile natural abundance C isotopes have been used as tracers with a great deal of\nsuccess elsewhere (Amelung et al., 2008), results from this application of the technique\nwere inconclusive. This may have resulted from the low initial slurry application reducing\nthe strength of the maize slurry \u03b413C signal, or may be a consequence of the long dry period\nbetween slurry application and drainage causing slurry-derived material to be (partly)\ndecomposed or sorbed onto soil surfaces. Furthermore, the nature of the label within the C4\nslurry was uncertain, appearing to be only partly labelled with a \u03b4 value of \u201318\u2030 compared\n25\nto other C4 slurries with \u03b4 values of about. \u201312\u2030 (Dungait et al., 2005). Unlike direct\nexcreta, slurry is a complex composite of potentially many materials and while the\n\u2018particulates\u2019 in the slurry might be considered to represent pieces of undigested or partially\ndigested C4 plant material and therefore fully labelled, the colloidal and soluble components\nmay represent material not sourced from the C4 substrate and therefore not labelled to the\nsame extent. These different size fractions are also subject to different processes and rates\nof decomposition (Fangueiro et al., 2008), with smaller organic particles being metabolised\ndifferently than larger ones. Other issues were methodological such as the separation of the\n>0.7 and <0.7\u00b5m material. Collecting and analysing >0.7\u00b5m material collected on GF\/C\npapers severely restricts the mass of actual particulate material available to the MS and\nalthough increasing the volume of sample filtered would have increased the amount of\nparticulate C on the filters, they would become rapidly clogged leading to large sample\npreparation times and the retention of material <0.7\u00b5m. Furthermore, the freeze dried\n<0.7\u00b5m material represented a composite of all colloids and solutes <0.7\u00b5m, thus may have\ncontained a component of inorganic C, which if present may have increased the \u03b413C values.\nNatural fluorescence has potential to act as an indicator for slurry-derived material\nhowever the nature of the signal is time dependent and probably only persists for 3-4 weeks\nafter slurry application. Thus, only direct losses may be traced using natural fluorescence\nrather than any longer term impacts. There is also a requirement for the samples to be\nanalysed quickly after sampling which may also limit the potential applications of the\ntechnique.\nConclusions\nThe artificial fluorescent particles show that organic slurry particles have the potential to\nmove readily from land to water and numbers increase and decrease with Q. Particles were\nlost via the inter-flow pathway of both the undrained and drain lysimeters and where both\ninter-flow and drain-flow pathways were present the drain-flow carried the greater number.\nNatural fluorescence TI:FI ratios were inconclusive. Although ratios were higher in slurry\namended lysimeters when compared to the zero slurry lysimeter, given the time interval\nbetween the application of slurry and the monitored runoff it is likely that most of the\nnatural fluorescence signal from the slurry would have been lost.\n26\nThe data obtained from the stable C isotope tracing approach were also inconclusive.\nThe \u03b413C of both particulate and dissolved phases were highly variable over time and only\nthe particulate material in the drain-flow appeared to carry a slurry signature.\nWhile many questions have been raised concerning the interpretation of the evidence\nfrom individual tracers, the simultaneous use of multiple tracers has been useful in helping\nto corroborate the available evidence. One of the main limitations in the experiment was\nthe low application rate of slurry and further work needs to be carried out using a higher\nrate of application. Another limitation was the length of time between the applied slurry\nand the first rainfall event which meant that the use of some of the tracers was limited.\nThere is a need to follow this up by more controlled experiments looking specifically at the\nmechanisms behind the tracers and the environmental processes through which they are\nchanged.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work was supported through a Department of Environment, Fisheries and Rural Affairs\n(Defra) grant (PE0120).
