Drawing upon institutional theory, both the USA and\nCanada are identified as liberal market economies. Building on this, we examine the HR\npreferences of subsidiaries originating in North America and operating in diverse liberal and\nco-ordinated market economies in order to test the extent to which the host context influences\nthe pattern of HR policies and practices pursued, referring predominantly to the literature on\nUSA firms. The results indicate that the pattern of HR practices pursued by North American\nowned MNCs varies widely depending on whether these North American owned MNCs are\noperating in liberal or co-ordinated market economies, lending support to the importance of\ncontext as a determinant of the likelihood of, and limits to, the transfer of HRM practices and\npreferences.\n2Introduction\nThe management of employees on a global scale creates a unique set of organizational, co-\nordination and managerial choices with respect to standardizing or localizing HR policy and\npractice (Tregaskis et al., 2000; Dickmann and M\u00fcller-Camen, 2006). In developing and\nimplementing policies and practices, MNCs and their subsidiaries must seek a balance\nbetween the implementation of HRM practices that conform to the legitimate expectations\nand requirements of their host environment, or the pursuit of more distinctive practices in\ntheir foreign subsidiaries based on those employed at home or best practices learned from\nother sources (Gunnigle et al., 2001). The institutionalisation of specific HR practices is\nhowever impacted by a complex range of factors, not least the nature of the institutional\nenvironment in each host location. This paper seeks to determine whether the HR policies of\nNorth American owned MNCs operating in North America vary compared to those operating\noutside North America in the institutional environment of liberal market economies (LMEs)\nor co-ordinated market economies (CMEs).\nDrawing upon Hall and Soskice\u2019s varieties of capitalism argument (2001) to distinguish\nliberal and co-ordinated market economies and employing 2003 Cranet data we assess the\nHR configurations of the subsidiaries of North American MNCs operating in liberal (UK and\nAustralia) and co-ordinated (Denmark, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden) market\neconomies. While the paper acknowledges that there are differences in the institutional\ncontext and HR practices of Canadian and USA MNCs, it will argue that there is much\nsimilarity of practices, underlying values and regulatory frameworks (Rosenzweig and\nNohria, 1994; Block, 2006). Overall, our analysis casts further light on the likelihood of, and\nlimits to, convergence in HR practices, and draws attention to the enduring tenets of\n3contextual HR practices in situations where there is manifest institutional distance between\nthe home and the host environment. First, however, we engage with the debate on the\ndesirability and feasibility of the international transfer of HR policies and practices in order to\nexplore why MNCs may want to retain consistent processes across overseas subsidiaries.\nDesirability of International Standardisation of HRM\nThere are several reasons why MNCs may want to co-ordinate their HRM internationally and\nwhy they might want to transfer their parent practices to their subsidiaries abroad. Firstly, if a\nfirm has a successful experience with specific HR approaches, it is likely to want to\nstandardise them internationally if it judges these to be appropriate to the local environment\n(Dickmann and M\u00fcller-Camen, 2006). Key reasons for this approach could include\neconomies of scale, higher quality of service and increased international coordination\n(Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989). Internationally operating MNCs are likely to transfer their\nhome HRM practices if they regard these practices as superior. Secondly, an ethical\ndimension may lead to the international standardisation of practices that are seen as\nlegitimate in its country of origin or in another national jurisdiction in which the firm\noperates. Examples on this front might include the establishment of systems that guarantee\nworkers\u2019 minimum rights and precludes child labour. Thirdly, MNCs may seek to integrate\nall policies around a specific set of HR policies and practices in order to support their wider\nbusiness strategy (Schuler and Jackson, 1987; Dickmann, 2003). This may entail extensive\nemployee development and involvement (Vitols et al., 1997). Fourthly, Bonache and\nDickmann (2008, in press) argue that in settings where MNCs strive to establish certain\nquality standards, expatriates act as critical nodes in the firms international network and\nperform the role of knowledge transferors from the head office outwards leading to the\n4potential for international standardisation of HRM (c.f. also Gupta and Godinvarajan, 2000;\nMorley & Heraty, 2004). Thus, the actual transfer of HR and other approaches may be related\nto the reasons why MNCs operate in the country in the first place. The desirability of\nconformity around home country standards does not, however, mean that it is also always\nfeasible. What operates successfully in one country may not be appropriate for another and,\nwhile importation of specific features of one system may occur, a blanket approach to the\ntransposition appears limited (Morley et al., 1996). It is to this issue of feasibility that we\nnow turn.\nFeasibility of Standardisation \u2013 Pressures for Localisation\nThere may be endogenous factors that have an impact on the degree of standardisation of HR\npractices across borders (Geppert, Williams and Matten, 2003; Dickmann and M\u00fcller-Camen,\n2006). Ferner and Edwards (1995) describe \u2018channels of influence\u2019 for organisational change\nsuch as control over power resources, authority structures, and organizational culture.\nMoreover, deeper trust between the corporate centre and the foreign operating unit supports\npractice transfer (Szulanski, 1996). Power dynamics influence the feasibility of\nstandardisation (Birkinshaw and Fry, 1998), and if the internalisation of practices that feel\n\u2018alien\u2019 in the host environment is incomplete, the actual standardisation may be less than\nperfect and conformity may indeed decrease over time (Ferner et al., 2005). The relationship\nbetween head office and the foreign affiliate(s) is likely to impact on the degree to which\npractices are adopted at operational level (Kostova and Roth, 2002). Thus, if local\nmanagement is able to resist the corporate centre, international integration is made more\ndifficult. MNCs may either not be capable of forcing, or may not wish to force, their\noperating units abroad to take up certain parent approaches (Dickmann et al., in press 2009).\n5DiMaggio and Powell (1991) argue that there may be coercive forces that may make it\nimpossible to standardise HR policies across borders. For instance, normative barriers to\ninternational standardisation in the form of increasing professionalisation of occupations and\ntheir institutional bodies may exist. Market characteristics or work norms exert normative\npressures for local isomorphism if their inherent values are distinct from those held abroad.\nFor instance, the dominant market logic (consumer vs. producer logic), the diverse bases of\nremuneration, the power of management and its interaction with others are distinct in the\nUSA compared to Germany or Japan (Pudelko, 2006). Thus, managers in these countries\nmight resist the transfer of a USA remuneration approach in favour of more security-oriented\ncompensation. Under conditions of institutional uncertainty it may be possible that local\nactors interpret and change the USA HR approaches to shape operational practices to suit\ntheir interests (Almond et al., 2005). In this respect a key factor that determines the feasibility\nof international transfer relates therefore to the compatibility of the business systems in\nquestion.\nThe debate regarding the international integration of business approaches has been an\nenduring feature of the international management literature for the last three decades and\noften distinguishes continued divergence or the process of directional or final convergence\n(Mayrhofer et al., 2002). There is still a substantial debate concerning the extent to which\nMNCs\u2019 \u201cforeign affiliates (or subsidiaries) act and behave as local firms versus the extent to\nwhich their practices resemble those of the parent corporation or some other global standard\u201d\n(Rosenzweig and Nohria, 1994: 229). It is often seen as a rather dichotomous debate with\nmany contributors suggesting that the national context, and the institutionalisation that flows\nfrom it, is all important, while others contend that practices of this nature are not subject to\n6the constraints of context and consequently MNCs have the ability to import practices at will\nand behave as free agents (Tregaskis et al., 2001). To explicate this argument on the context\nspecific nature of the business system, and the potential for distance between such systems,\nwe draw upon Hall and Soskice\u2019s (2001) framework which we discuss below.\nLMEs and CMEs: Diverging degrees of freedom and distinct HR bases\nIn framing the above debate, the nature of the national business system is seen to be of high\nsignificance. Hall and Soskice (2001) argue that developed capitalist countries can be divided\ninto \u2018liberal market economies\u2019 (LMEs) and \u2018co-ordinated market economies\u2019 (CMEs).\nLMEs, such as the USA, Canada, UK, or Australia are countries in which relations between\nfirms are co-ordinated, primarily by competitive markets. On the other hand CMEs, such as\nGermany, Sweden, Denmark or the Netherlands are countries where firms typically engage in\nmore strategic interaction with trade unions, suppliers of finance and other actors.\nComplementarities between external relations \u2013 such as relations with the government, banks,\nuniversities, industry bodies, trade unions and employer federations \u2013 are seen to develop\nover time, along with company approaches regarding employment relations, modes of\ninvestment activities or corporate governance (Whitley, 1999). Jacoby (2005) stresses that\neconomic actors react to similar external pressures in different ways due to path dependencies.\nBecause economic institutions in a state interact, the author argues that there may be\ncontinued divergence, even though the reaction to the pressures may aim at the same outcome.\nJacoby likens it to rotary and diesel engines \u2013 the parts are different but the outcome of\ngenerating horsepower (or torque) is the same (2005: 17).\n7Kostova (1999) has looked at the \u2018country institutional profile\u2019 (CIP) distinguishing\nregulatory, normative and cognitive institutions. Based on the extent of \u2018institutional\ndistance\u2019 between countries, the feasibility of transfer of HR practices is seen to be impacted.\nThe higher the institutional distance, the more difficulties a cross-national transfer of HR\npractices may entail. We may expect that the degree of localisation that occurs in MNCs is\ndifferent according to whether the host country is an LME or CME and that the suite of\ndominant HR practices pursued will vary, depending on the institutional distance and the\nspecific regulatory context. The various pressures which Kostova and Roth (2002) identify\nwould indicate that the degrees of freedom not to conform to the predominant HR context are\nhigher in LMEs than in CMEs.\nThis paper will examine the degree of transfer of HRM policies used within the context of an\nMNC\u2019s home country to a liberal market economy away from home and a coordinated\nmarket economy away from home. We have chosen to focus on North American MNCs due\nto their prevalence, so we will explore the degree to which HR policies are being transferred\nin North American MNCs located in LMEs and CMEs. Firstly however, we will establish\nthe important features of HRM in North American MNCs and review past research on the\ntransfer of these practices.\nHRM in North American Companies\nThere is a long tradition of analysing American HRM (Guest, 1990) \u2013 mostly referring to\nNorth American HR policies and practices and, amongst those, concentrating on the USA. As\nsome of the key ideas of HRM emerged from the United States (e.g. Fombrun et al., 1984;\nBeer et al., 1985), European commentators have analysed the differences between USA and\n8European HRM (Ferner, 1997; Brewster et al., 2000; Brewster et al., 2004; Almond et al.,\n2005) \u2013 in fact, so much so, that voices have emerged warning that some of these differences\nmay be exaggerated (Strauss, 2001). In an attempt at parsimony, we provide here only a brief\nsummary of the defining features of the USA \u2018model\u2019 of HRM.\nKey areas of distinctiveness of USA HRM include the emphasis on strategic HRM (Schuler\nand Jackson, 2005) and the handling of employment relations and communication on an\nindividualised basis (Kalleberg et al., 1996). Distinctive USA HRM practices also include the\nuse of sophisticated selection techniques in employee resourcing (Gunnigle et al., 2001), the\npursuit of individualised, performance based rewards (Colling and Clark, 2002), a focus on\ntraining and development for the purposes of human capital accumulation (Giardini et al.,\n2005), and a strong emphasis on diversity management (Egan and Bendick, 2003). Due to the\ndistinctiveness of the USA HRM model along these dimensions, and the attachment to a\nuniversalist paradigm with a \u201ctacit conviction that there is a one-best-way of organising for\nefficiency\u201d (Mayrhofer et al., 2000: 6), attempting to transfer preferred home approaches to\noverseas host locations offers the appealing prospect of using standardised HR practices.\nTransfer of USA HRM to Europe\nWe will now examine past literature on the transfer of USA HRM practices to American\nMNCs based away from the USA. Case study research on the HR behaviour of USA MNCs\nabroad tends to focus on the reasons for international standardisation, organisational\nstructures as well as the processes, power dimensions and outcomes over time (Ferner and\nQuintanilla, 1998; Singe and Croucher, 2005). For instance, with regards to the nature of the\ndetermination of HRM policy, Ferner et al. (2004) found that USA MNCs displayed\n9centralised, standardised and formalised traits. With respect to the identified USA HR model\naspects, some key studies looking at the HR behaviour of USA MNCs in Europe are outlined\nbelow.\nIn their study of foreign MNCs operating in Europe Gunnigle et al. (2001) found that\nalthough MNCs from both the USA and differing European countries modified their practices\nto account for the host context, levels of localisation in USA MNCs tended to be lower than\nother MNCs. Singe and Croucher (2005) found that USA-based companies abroad appear to\nformally comply with works council regulations and sectoral bargaining patterns in Germany.\nTheir case studies, however, indicate that USA MNCs in Germany may practice works\ncouncil avoidance and that they may put pressure on works councillors to distance\nthemselves from trade unions. The authors conclude that these firms tend to explore all\noptions available to them within the existing system.\nNoble (1997) argues that while USA MNCs may be ethnocentric with regards to their\ncompetitive strategies, it is possible that they are polycentric in training and development.\nEgan and Bendick (2003) found that diversity principles were transferred but that local\naffiliates had the necessary degrees of freedom to adapt the diversity approach to the national\nand local context. Poutsma et al. (2005) looked at the international transfer of reward\napproaches within USA multinationals. They concentrated on share option schemes and\nfound an Anglo-Saxonisation effect in continental Europe. While in the range of HR\napproaches there is evidence of Anglo-Saxonisation of USA MNCs\u2019 subsidiaries, there are\nalso substantial institutional barriers to standardisation in CMEs (M\u00fcller, 1998; Geppert,\nMatten and Williams, 2003).\n10\nCombined, the insights from these studies point to a complex picture of standardisation and\nlocalisation depending on the nature of the specific HR practice being explored and the\ninstitutional characteristics of the host location. However, few would argue that our\nknowledge of this complex aspect of operating internationally is complete. It is partial at best\nwith the result that much more evidence on the possibility for, and the conditions under\nwhich, HRM transfer can occur is required. Garnering further evidence on this front is\nimportant and timely. It is an area in which complexity continues to increase as the diversity\nof host locations for FDI around the globe grows rapidly. Drawing upon institutional thinking,\nwhich is especially useful for landscaping the similarities and differences inherent in different\ncountries\u2019 business systems and the resultant proximity or distance evident between countries,\nwe explore this debate further.\nResearch questions\nWhile a stylised USA \u2018model\u2019 of HRM has emerged from the above, it is important to move\nbeyond a simplistic notion to understand the degree of these \u2018typical\u2019 HR strategies, policies\nand practices in reality. In our initial step, we explored the HR configurations of North\nAmerican companies in LMEs and CMEs.\nWe acknowledge that the \u2018gestalt\u2019 of HRM in its institutional context varies somewhat\nbetween Canada and the USA, but for the purposes of our analysis, reasonable conceptual\nand empirical equivalence between both countries can be drawn on the HRM front.\nConceptually, there is little doubt that Canada displays less extensive characteristics of liberal\nmarket economies than does the USA. For instance, the trade union density and presence\nwithin Canadian industry is higher than in the USA and the USA system is \u201cless conducive to\n11\nunion membership than the Canadian system\u201d (Block, 2006: 36). Other differences include\nvariations in bargaining arrangements, dispute resolution machinery, economic regulation\nand constraints on capital and employment practices. Despite these differences, institutional\nprovision springing from the industrial relations systems of both the USA and Canada has\nresulted in them being characterised as siblings in that they have \u201csimilar origins and reflect\nsimilar values\u201d (Block, 2006: 25) and in the HR sphere, research does indicate a similarity\nbetween HR practice in USA and Canada (cf. Rosenzweig and Nohria, 1994). Furthermore,\nthe Canadian economy is characterized by a very high presence of USA-based MNCs\n(B\u00e9langer et al., 2006). In addition, Templer et al. (1997: 551) note that legislative impacts\nhave \u201cdirected HR practice towards equality issues such as employment equity and pay\nequity\u201d.\nEmpirically, our argument on the equivalence between the USA and Canada on this front\nmay also be defended. Using data from a previous Cranet survey we have run an analysis to\nexamine the similarity of HRM in USA and Canadian MNCs and our results too point to few\nsignificant differences. More specifically we have compared USA and Canadian owned\nMNCs operating in a range of countries outside of North America on a number of dimensions\nrelating to recruitment and selection, diversity, rewards, briefing strategy and training using\nthe 1999 Cranet data. In each case, we found that the USA and Canadian owned MNCs were\nnot significantly different. In this context, using North American owned MNCs, incorporating\nUSA and Canadian owned together, as the wellspring for our analysis in this paper can\ntherefore be justified.\nWe isolated the North American owned sub-sample, and explored whether the context in\nwhich these North American MNCs were operating resulted in a distinct pattern of HR\n12\npolicies and practices. We were guided by the above discussion on the dominant business\nsystem and its effects on MNCs\u2019 approach to HRM standardisation\/localization to draw up\nthe following research questions designed to explore whether the context in which these\nNorth American MNCs operate results in a distinctive pattern of HR policies and practices.\nThe following two research questions guided our empirical effort.\n1. Do North American owned MNCs outside of North America located within liberal\nmarket economies display different HR policies and practices to those located within\nco-ordinated market economies, and those located within North America itself?\n2. If so, are North American owned MNCs in LMEs more similar to North American\nMNCs in North America than to North American MNCs in CMEs?\nWe have explored above that there is a strong stream of literature which argues that North\nAmerican originating MNC subsidiaries seek to institutionalise characteristics of their home\nbusiness system or \u201ccountry of origin\u201d in the management of their foreign subsidiaries. We\nnow propose to further test whether this is the case in our sample and whether the national\nbusiness system context, namely liberal or co-ordinated economy, has explanatory power in\naccounting for the degree of standardisation or localisation evident in our sample.\nMethod\nData\nThe data used in this study were taken from the 2003 Cranet survey, by far the most\ncomprehensive international survey of HR policies and practices at the organisational level.\nCranet is a regular comparative survey of organisational policies and practices across the\n13\nworld conducted by a network of business schools operating in 40 countries (see Brewster et\nal., 2004, for full details of the questionnaire and its methodology). The unit of analysis is the\norganisation and the respondent is the highest-ranking corporate officer in charge of HRM.\nThe 2003 questionnaire was developed using an iterative process between network members\nand based on previous experience of running survey rounds since 1990.\nRespondents in each country were identified via the use of a database of senior HR managers\nin public and private sector organisations. For the purpose of this study, only North American\nowned private sector multinational organisations in the UK, Australia, Germany, Sweden,\nDenmark, The Netherlands, USA and Canada were included. This data set comprised of a\ntotal of 540 organisations. The overall data was approximately representative for the\npopulation of each country in terms of industry sector and organisation size.\nINSERT TABLE 1 HERE\nFor the purpose of the analysis, firms were grouped according to whether they were located\nin a liberal market economy (UK and Australia), a co-ordinated market economy (Denmark,\nGermany, Netherlands and Sweden) or in the home environment, namely North America.\nThe 2003 Cranet survey (2003 data) identifies companies\u2019 ownership by continent rather than\nindividual country, therefore we were only able to access data for North American (i.e.\nCanada and USA combined) owned companies. There are a number of factors that make this\nfeasible. Firstly, in earlier iterations of the Cranet survey when ownership was identified by\nindividual country, the number of Canadian subsidiaries was small in comparison with USA\nforeign affiliates. For example, in the 1999 survey only 18 responses were received from\nCanadian owned countries located out of Canada (out of a total of 9394 responses). Secondly,\n14\nif the expected differences of the Canadian institutional context to CMEs are smaller than\nthose differences expected between the USA context and CMEs, identifying divergences of\nNorth American MNCs in co-ordinated host environments will be harder than just using USA\nMNCs. Thus, our approach may represent more of an \u2018acid test\u2019.\nMeasures and analyses\nThe dependent variable was location as whether the firm was located in a liberal market\neconomy, a co-ordinated market economy or North America (1, 2 or 3).\nArising from our earlier taxonomy of HRM as a multifaceted construct, we developed\nmeasures of HRM policy and practice that tapped all of the domains described above. These\nwere constructed by combining responses on a series of related variables into an index. This\nfollows the precedent of previous literature using Cranet data, for example Croucher et al.,\n2006; Fenton-O\u2019Creevy et al., 2008). The variables employed were as follows:\nStrategic HRM This is an index consisting of responses to eight items from the Cranet\nsurvey and is designed to assess how \u2018strategic\u2019 the role of the HR department within the\norganisation is. The eight questions are:\n\uf0b7 Does the head of the personnel\/HR department have a place on the main Board of\nDirectors or equivalent? (1 = yes, 0 = no).\n\uf0b7 At what stage is the person responsible for personnel\/HR involved in the development\nof business strategy? (a four-point scale: consultation from the outset = 4, not\nconsulted = 1.).\n\uf0b7 Does your organisation have a Personnel\/HRM strategy? (2 = yes, written, 1 = yes,\nunwritten, 0= no).\n15\n\uf0b7 Who has primary responsibility for major policy decisions in the following issues: pay\nand benefits, recruitment and selection, training and development, industrial relations,\nworkforce expansion\/reduction? (A four-point scale: line management = 1, line\nmanagement in consultation with HR = 2, HR in consultation with line management =\n3, HR department = 4).\nThe sum of the responses to the above eight questions was used to form an index that ranged\nfrom 1 (low degree of strategic HRM) to 27 (high degree of strategic HRM). The reliability\nof this index as measured by Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.68.\nSelection sophistication This was a composite measure of which methods were used to\nselect management, professional\/technical, clerical and manual employees. The methods\nincluded were panel interviews, one-to-one interviews, application forms, psychometric tests,\nassessment centres and references. A 24-point scale was created with 24 indicating that the\nfirm used all six methods across all four levels and zero suggesting that none of the methods\nwas used for any level. The reliability of this index as measured by Cronbach\u2019s alpha was\n0.77.\nInvestment in training This was measured by a single item where respondents were asked to\nindicate the actual proportion of their annual payroll bill that was spent on training.\nIndividualised rewards This was a composite measure of whether management,\nprofessional\/technical, clerical and manual employees were offered variable pay based upon\nindividual performance. A four-point scale was created with four indicating that the firm\noffered variable pay based on individual performance to all four levels and zero indicating\nthat none of the four levels were offered this. The reliability of this index as measured by\nCronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.80.\nDiversity programmes An index was created to measure whether the company had action\nprogrammes to cover minority ethnics, older workers, people with disabilities and women. A\n16\nscore of four would indicate that the firm offered programmes for all four of these categories\nwhile zero would indicate that the firm offered programmes for none of these categories. The\nreliability of this index as measured by Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.79.\nTrade union recognition This was a single item asking respondents whether the firm\nrecognised trade unions for the purpose of collective bargaining (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nFormal consultation A single item was used where respondents were asked whether the firm\nhad a joint consultative committee or works council (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nDirect Communication This was a composite measure of whether firms used verbal, written\nor electronic methods to communicate directly to employees. A four-point scale was created\nwith three indicating that all three methods were used and zero indicating that none of the\nthree were used. The reliability of this index as measured by Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.65.\nIndirect communication A single item measure was utilised asking respondents whether the\nfirm had a representative staff body for communicating with employees (1 = yes, 0 = no).\nBriefing strategy This was a composite measure of whether organisations briefed clerical\nand manual employees on issues of business strategy, financial performance and organisation\nof work. A seven-point scale was created with six indicating the briefing of both clerical and\nmanual employees on all three issues and zero indicating no briefing of either category on\nany of the issues. The reliability of this index as measured by Cronbach\u2019s alpha was 0.76.\nThe controls included:\nIndustry sector This was a dichotomous variable distinguishing manufacturing (1) and\nservices (2).\nOrganisation size This was operationalised as the log (10) of the number of employees.\nAge of organisation This was operationalised as the log (10) of the number of years since the\norganisation was founded.\n17\nResults\nPrior to examining our research questions, a bivariate correlation analysis of the predictor\nvariables was conducted. The results of this analysis are shown in table 2.\nINSERT TABLE 2 HERE\nIt can be seen from the above table that, while there were some correlations between\nvariables, these were not large enough to indicate multicollinearity.\nIn order to examine the research questions, a MANOVA was conducted in order to determine\nthe differences between North American owned companies located in North America, in\nliberal market economies outside of North America (LME) and in co-ordinated market\neconomies (CME). All variables were standardized to z scores prior to this analysis. The\noverall model was highly significant (Wilks Lambda = 0.653, F = 3.462, p<0.01). We can\ntherefore go on to examine the univariate F values from the MANOVA.\nINSERT TABLE 3 HERE\nThe MANOVA demonstrated that there were some significant differences between North\nAmerican owned MNCs located in host LMEs, host CMEs or located at home in North\nAmerica. North American MNCs in the three locations were significantly different in terms\n18\nof their selection sophistication, diversity programmes, trade union recognition, formal\nconsultation and briefing strategy. To answer our first research question therefore, this\nfinding suggests that North American owned MNCs located in CMEs are indeed different to\nthose located in LMEs or in North America itself. Post-hoc Tukey\u2019s tests were then carried\nout for those variables with significant F values (also shown in table 3).\nAn examination of the means in the three locations showed that selection sophistication was\nhighest in LMEs, followed by North America and then lowest in CMEs. A post-hoc Tukey\u2019s\nHSD showed that the difference between selection sophistication in North American MNCs\nin CMEs and LMEs was statistically significant (p<0.01). Diversity programmes were more\ncommon in North American MNCs located in North America, compared to the similar levels\nin North American MNCs located in LMEs and CMEs. A post-hoc Tukey\u2019s HSD indicated\nthat the difference between MNCs located in North America and LMEs was significant\n(p<0.01), as was the difference between MNCs located in North America and CMEs (p<0.01).\nTrade union recognition was higher in North American MNCs located in CMEs, compared to\nthose located in LMEs or in North America. The difference between North American MNCs\nin LMEs and CMES (p<0.01) and the difference between North American MNCs in CMEs\nand in North America (p<0.05) were significant according to a post-hoc Tukey\u2019s HSD\n(p<0.01). Formal Consultation was also more common in North American MNCs located in\nCMEs compared to those located in LMEs or North America. A post-hoc Tukey\u2019s HSD\nshowed that these differences were highly significant (p<0.01). Briefing strategy was highest\nin North American MNCs in CMEs, followed by those in LMEs and then North America.\nThe difference between briefing strategy in North American MNCs in CMEs or LMEs\ncompared to those in North America was significant according to the post-hoc Tukey\u2019s HSD\n(p<0.05).\n19\nOverall our results showed that, half of the HR areas examined in North American MNCs are\ndifferent, according to whether they are operating in a LME, CME or in North America itself.\nSpecifically, we have seen significant differences in terms of selection sophistication, trade\nunion recognition and formal consultation between North American companies in LMEs and\nCMEs, and for other HR areas, namely briefing strategy and diversity programmes, between\nthose MNCs operating in North America or outside North America (regardless of whether\nthey are located in an LME or CME) and can therefore answer our first research question\npositively.\nWith reference to our second research question, the results also suggested that North\nAmerican MNCs in North America are more similar to North American MNCs in LMEs than\nto those in CMEs for our variables of selection sophistication, trade union recognition, formal\nconsultation and briefing strategy. However, for diversity programmes, North American\nMNCs in North America were significantly different to both those operating in LMEs and\nCMEs.\nDiscussion\nThe enormous significance of multinational companies, most especially North American\nowned MNCs, in the global economy is without question. In Dicken\u2019s (2003: 197) words:\n\u201cmore than any other single institution, the transnational corporation\u2026has come to be\nregarded as the primary shaper of the contemporary global economy\u201d. The MNC is often\nviewed as the vehicle by which dominant HR policies and practices are transported across\n20\nnational boundaries. Against this however, Guest and Hoque (1996: 50) have noted that\n\u201ceven in an increasingly global economy, we find persistent variations in the approaches to\nthe management of human resources\u201d. And while often USA MNCs are scrutinised, there is a\ntendency for MNCs from other countries \u2013 such as from Germany, the UK or Japan \u2013 to\ntransfer parts of their HR approaches internationally (Dickmann, 2003; Geppert, Matten and\nWilliams, 2003; M\u00fcller, 1998). A critical question in this respect therefore is whether human\nresource practices that reflect the country of ownership are imposed on the MNCs subsidiary\noperating in different host locations? We have explored this question through our\nexamination of HRM practices in North American MNCs in different locations.\nMuch of the landscape of HRM in MNCs is relatively uncharted and the role of institutional\ncontext is under-researched. It is asserted that the institutional environment can strongly\ninfluence the development of formal structures in an organization, often more profoundly\nthan market pressures, resulting in the necessity to localize and adapt practices in order to\noperate successfully within the host institutional environment (Tregaskis et al., 2001), but\ncross cultural, empirical evidence on this matter is relatively scarce.\nThis paper adds to the available robust, cross-national evidence. Drawing upon the varieties\nof capitalism argument as our contextual framework for distinguishing liberal and co-\nordinated market economies, we have sought to determine the likelihood of, and limits to, the\nstandardisation of HRM practices among North American MNCs operating in diverse host\nlocations. We isolated these MNCs operating in a diverse set of locations in order to test\nwhether there were distinctive patters of standardisation and localisation being pursued,\ndepending on whether these North American owned MNCs were operating in the home\nenvironment or abroad in liberal or co-ordinated market economies.\n21\nOur results, in combination, point to the important of context and the proximity or distance\nbetween the home and host institutional environment as factors that hold important\nexplanatory power in determining the likely pattern of HRM policies and practices pursued.\nIn this respect, our empirical effort further explicates the value of the contextual paradigm in\ninternational comparative HRM research and its approach to searching for an overall\nunderstanding of what is contextually unique and why. In our topic area, it is focused on\nunderstanding what is different between and within HRM in various contexts. Thus, from our\nanalysis, sophisticated selection as the preferred approach to employee resourcing once again\nemerged as significant, being highest among MNCs operating in LMEs and in MNCs\noperating at home in North America. Given the preference for a multifaceted approach to\nselection in the home location, the transfer of this approach to LMEs is to be expected and the\ndeployment of a range of selection tools where there are few language, cultural or\ninstitutional barriers can be expected.\nAs predicted the deployment of diversity programmes was significant, being most prevalent\namong MNCs operating at home. The North American literature on the competitive benefits\nand HR opportunity of diversity is growing (Cox and Blake, 1991; Richard, 2000). Diversity\nis a typical example of an issue that has received much more attention in both the legal and\nbusiness HR arena on the other side of the Atlantic than it ever has in Europe (Ferner et al.,\n2006).\nIn line with our expectations, trade union recognition was highly significant in our model,\nwith CME location emerging as distinctive from both LME and home location. CMEs display\na characteristic collectivism, which is expressed as the provision for union recognition and\n22\nthe right to bargaining. This sits in contrast to the North American context where the social\nand economic environment has been described as hostile to unionism and to many traditional\nunion practices and policies (Blanchflower and Freeman, 1992). Gooderham et al. (2004: 20)\nrefer to the emergence of USA HRM as a new model of management, less compatible with\nunionisation than the old and purposefully designed to remove the rigidities intrinsic in the\nmass production system. Therefore a rather constant thread in research programmes in the\nUSA has been the link between HRM practices and union avoidance.\nAllied to the trade union recognition issue, while indirect communication was not significant\nin our model, it was nearing significance (p = 0.07), being highest in CMEs, when compared\nwith LMEs or home location. Indirect communication was also highly prevalent in LME\noperations, in comparison to the home location. Similarly, formal consultation was highest in\nCMEs, followed by LMEs and lowest in the home location, confirming, once again, the\nsignificant of host location regulatory frameworks for determining such consultation. In this\nrespect Morley et al. (2000) have argued that there is clear evidence that organisations in\nEuropean CMEs are going beyond mere statements about their employees being their major\nasset, to developing and increasing the amount of communication and consultation in which\nthey involve those employees.\nOverall therefore, in our analysis contextual determinants can be viewed as important\nexplanatory factors governing the likely pursuit of standardised or more localised HR\npractices. Where institutional distance is low, the host institutional environment may be read\nas permissive of headquarter derived practices, with the result that standardisation is the\nlikely preferred approach among the North American owned MNCs studied. By contrast,\nwhere the host environment is viewed as being more distant from the home, with high\n23\nexpectations of conformance to the regulatory framework, elements of localisation will be\nengaged in. This is especially evident in the area of trade union recognition for the purposes\nof collective bargaining, consultation provisions and collective, rather than purely direct\nindividualised communication provision, where the pattern in institutionally distant CMEs is\ndistinctive from that observed in the home environment and the more proximate LME\nenvironment.\nConclusion\nSeveral contributors have previously argued for the critical role played by the context and the\nnecessity to give expression to this in conceiving our intercultural research models and in\nexplaining differences in the extent to which MNCs can and will pursue localized, rather than\nstandardized, HRM practices (Carr and Pudelko, 2006; Von Glinow et al., 2002; Geppert,\nMatten and Williams, 2003). Our evidence adds further weight to the likely influence of\ncontext in this regard. Employing a national business systems lens as a theoretical framework\nfor capturing the degree of institutionalised distance between the home and host environment,\nour empirical test sought to establish the significance of high or low institutional distance in\naccounting for the likelihood of standardisation or localisation in HRM policy and practice\namong these MNCs when operating abroad. On the institutional proximity or distance from\nthe North American home context as a determinant of standardisation or localisation, we\nconclude that this is significant in explaining the likely pattern of HR policies and practices\npursued. In this way, our evidence here lends support to the argument that HRM is not a\nuniversal concept, but rather remains a socially constructed, institutionally derived\nphenomenon with manifest differences in the way it is conceptualized and conducted\n(Geppert, Matten and Williams, 2003).\n24\nOne of the contributions of this research is that it allows a wide perspective on the varieties of\ncapitalism literature and the degrees of freedom that MNCs have in shaping their HRM\nstrategies, policies and practices. This field is dominated by qualitative, case study based\ncontributions which are extended through our quantitative work. Using the most recent 2003\nCranet data set also allowed us to explore a wide range of countries using a sophisticated set\nof indicators. Thus, the basis for generalisations based on our findings is stronger, especially\ngiven that the large number of Canadian MNCs within the sample meant that we conducted\nwhat is in fact an analysis where it would be more difficult to gain significant differences due\nto HRM in USA MNCs being more distinct from CMEs than that of USA MNCs. The\ninfluence of the institutional environment does not, however, mean that cross-national\nstandardisation and knowledge transfer is impossible. It serves to remind us that there are\ndiverse degrees of institutional freedom and that desirability and feasibility of international\nconvergence may diverge. It allows us to reflect on the desirability of institutional cohesion\nin contrast to innovation from other national business systems and organisational HR\nconfigurations. Moreover, it gives valuable insights to HR strategists and practitioners on the\nrequisite complexity of HR approaches in their organisations\u2019 strive for international\nefficiency, local responsiveness and worldwide innovativeness (Dickmann et al., in press\n2009).\nSignificant among the forces at play here are idiosyncratic institutionalised elements derived\nfrom inter alia national, cultural and legislation, State intervention and organizational level\ntrade union involvement and participation and the requirement for consultation, dialogue and\ncommunication between the social partners. The combination of these forces creates a unique\n25\ncontextual landscape, the significance of which the MNC must judge when deciding on its\npreferred approach to HRM in that host location.\nThis study is not without its limitations. The use of single source data is not ideal as it may\nallow bias into our research process. However, we have attempted to overcome these effects\nby asking about the existence of actual HRM policies and practices, rather than more\nsubjective questions. In addition, while our sample is approximately representative of the\npopulation in terms of industry sector and organisation size, we have not controlled for these\nfactors. We have also asked respondents to indicate their general use of particular practices,\nfor example selection methods, across occupational groups and levels. It may be that\ndifferences exist between different types of organisations and occupational roles. However,\nthis study still provides a valid and interesting initial investigation of the relationship between\nlocation and the localisation or otherwise of HR practices. Further research should examine\nthe impact of the nature of the organisation or role on this relationship.\nClearly more research into the national business system differences in host and home\nenvironments and the extent of feasible learning as well as the degrees of HR freedom can\nbecome an important source for key institutional and organisational decision-makers. These\nnew insights can provide a linchpin for determining the likelihood of success or failure in,\nand the desirability of, transferring and standardising practices in the HRM arena.\nReferences\nAlmond, P., Edwards, T., Colling, T., Ferner, A., Gunnigle, P., M\u00fcller-Camen, M.,\nQuintanilla, J., and W\u00e4chter, H., (2005) \u2018Unravelling Home and Host Country Effects: An\n26\nInvestigation of the HR Policies of an American Multinational in Four European Countries\u2019,\nIndustrial Relations, 44(2): 276-306.\nBartlett, C. and Ghoshal, S.
