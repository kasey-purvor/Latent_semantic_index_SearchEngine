Accretionary orogens affect over half of the globe and \nhave a distinctively different evolution to Wilson type orogens.  It is increasingly \nevident that accretionary orogenesis has played a significant role in the formation of \nthe continents.  The Pacific-margin of Gondwana preserves a major orogenic belt, \ntermed here the \u201cAustralides\u201d, that was an active site of terrane accretion from \nNeoproterozoic to Late Mesozoic times, and comparable in scale to the Rockies from \nMexico to Alaska, or the Variscan\u2013Appalachian orogeny.  The New Zealand sector of \nthis orogenic belt was one of the birthplaces of terrane theory and the Australide \norogeny overall continues to be an important testing ground for terrane studies.  This \nvolume summarizes the history and principles of terrane theory and presents sixteen \nnew works that review and synthesize the current state of knowledge for the \nGondwana margin, from Australia through New Zealand and Antarctica to South \nAmerica, and examine the evolution of the whole Gondwana margin through time. \n \nIntroduction \n \nWhy this book?  Two main types of orogenic belt have been identified on the Earth: \norogens of the Wilson-type (e.g., Wilson 1966; Murphy & Nance 2003), involving \ncollision between continents, and orogens of the accretionary, Cordilleran type (e.g., \nSeng\u00f6r & Natalin 1996; Tagami & Hasebe 1999; Scarrow et al. 2002), where a more \nsteady state addition of smaller crustal fragments occurs.  In simplest terms, \ncollisional orogens are assumed to be the end-point of cycles of ocean formation and \ndestruction during continental break-up and re-amalgamation (the so-called \u201cWilson \nCycle\u201d); accretionary orogens are the product of more continuous processes of \n 3\naddition of oceanic, island arc, and ocean-captured continental material to oceanic \nmargins during long-term subduction, often without oceanic closure.  Accretionary \norogens are often characterized by being much wider across-strike than collisional \norogens (Seng\u00f6r & Okurogullari 1991).  Overall, it would seem that collisional and \naccretionary orogens form end members of a spectrum (Murphy & Keppie 2003; \nMurphy & Nance 2003).  The Wilson-type end member is the \u201caulacogen\u201d (e.g., \nZolnai 1986; Pedrosa-Soares et al. 2001), where there is little or no displacement of \ncontinental margins and the ocean basin, which is often narrow, often closes up with \njig-saw precision.  The simplest accretionary end-member consists of a complex or \nprism (e.g., Leggett 1987; Doubleday et al. 1994; Kamp 2000), created through \nscraping-off of the upper parts of oceanic lithosphere as it is subducted. This may \nform at a continental margin or adjacent to an intra-oceanic arc, and ultimately may \nbe displaced large distances, either across ocean basins or along continental margins, \nduring, or subsequent to, formation.  Real situations are a complex mix of Wilson- \nand accretionary types (e.g., Betts et al. 2002), where full-scale oceans that form with \nor without subsequent closure may have accretionary complexes on their margins, and \nexperience subsidiary terrane and arc-collisional orogens that themselves incorporate \naccretionary complexes.  Even \u201cpure\u201d accretionary orogens, such as the Uralide\u2013\nAltaid orogen that forms much of Asia (Seng\u00f6r & Natalin 1996), where there is no \nevidence of continent\u2013continent collision, consist of many minor terrane and arc \ncollisional orogens that occurred on the margins of a long-lived ocean.  The \nunderstanding of the relative significance of Wilson-type and accretionary orogens \nhas changed with time.  Historically, much early work focussed on Wilson-type \norogenesis, particularly in the context of the circum-Atlantic orogens affecting \nnorthwest Europe and eastern North America from Proterozoic through to Late \n 4\nPalaeozoic times (e.g., Phillips et al. 1976; Williams & Hatcher 1982; Keppie 1985a; \nRyan & Dewey 1997; Matte 2001; Young et al. 2001; Bandres et al. 2002; Gower & \nKrogh 2002), which may have inflated its significance in global terms.  Williams & \nHatcher (1982) were the first to show that a Wilson-type model may not be \nappropriate for the case examples associated with the evolution of the Iapetus Ocean \nand this is supported by more recent lithostratigraphic, faunal and palaeomagnetic \ndata (O'Brien et al. 1983; Cocks & Torsvik 2002; Hartz & Torsvik 2002).  Doubts \nabout its applicability to the Pacific Cordillera of western North America came even \nearlier (Danner 1970).  Although major, Wilson-type continental collision can form \nlong lived continents such as Gondwana (e.g., Unrug 1992; Boger et al. 2001), global \nsyntheses (e.g., Seng\u00f6r & Natalin 1996) have emphasized the importance of \naccretionary orogens, arguing that these were responsible for growth and stabilization \nof millions of km2 of the continental lithosphere from Archaean times onwards \n(Seng\u00f6r et al. 1993; Foster & Gray 2000; Polat & Kerrich 2001; Xiao et al. 2004).  \nAccretionary orogens are directly and indirectly host to globally important mineral \ndeposits (e.g., Richards & Kerrich 1993; Sherlock et al. 1999; Kerrich et al. 2000; \nGoldfarb et al. 2001).  For example, volcanic arc and back-arc terranes form an \nimportant part of accretionary orogens and it is increasingly recognized that active, \nsubmerged arcs and back-arcs are sites of significant metallogenesis (e.g., Fouquet et \nal. 1991; Ishibashi & Urabe 1995; Iizasa et al. 1999; Fiske et al. 2001).  Submarine \narc-hosted mineral deposits are not easily accessible in their sites of formation \nbecause sea-floor mining is technically challenging (e.g., Scott 2001); however, \nterrane accretionary orogenesis has an additional importance in incorporating arc and \nsea-floor mineral deposits in continental lithosphere, making them accessible to \nsimpler extraction techniques.  Finally, in this volume, Vaughan & Livermore \n 5\n(2005) present evidence that accretionary orogenesis is not uniformly distributed in \ntime, with implications for our understanding of Earth evolution. Vaughan & \nLivermore (2005) show that two major pulses of terrane accretion occurred in the \nMesozoic, not just affecting the \"Australides\" on the Gondwana margin but with \nglobal extent, possibly associated with major episodes of flood magmatism. \n \nThe accretionary orogenic belt that formed on the palaeo-Pacific and Pacific margin \nof Gondwana in Neoproterozoic\u2013Mesozoic times (Fig. 1) (Ireland et al. 1998) is one \nof the largest known orogenic belts in Earth history.  The orogen (the Neoproterozoic \nto Palaeozoic part of this orogeny has been called the Terra Australis orogen by \nCawood & Leitch (2002)) now occupies the eastern third of Australia, New Zealand, \nWest Antarctica, the Transantarctic Mountains and large parts of southern South \nAmerica (Fig. 1) (e.g., Bradshaw 1994; Cawood & Leitch 2002).  Several factors have \nhampered reconstruction of this Neoproterozoic to Mesozoic orogenic belt \u2013 a time-\nextended Terra Australis orogen, finishing in the mid-Cretaceous, which we will \ninformally refer to here as the \"Australides\"; Fig. 1.  These include dismemberment \nand dispersal of its components during Mesozoic break-up of the supercontinent \nGondwana, burial of large parts of it beneath ice (in Antarctica) and later sedimentary \nbasins (in all other parts of the belt), local submergence of continental margins \n(notably the continental margins of New Zealand), and partial obliteration and \noverprinting by continued subduction-related magmatism and deformation (as in \nmany parts if the Andes and Antarctic Peninsula).  The size of the reconstructed \norogenic belt \u2013 over 7000 km long by over 1500 km wide \u2013 is larger than the \nMesozoic\u2013Cenozoic orogenic belt that extends from Alaska to Mexico along the \n 6\nPacific margin of the North American continent and is comparable in scale to the \nVariscan orogenic belt of Europe and eastern North America (Matte 2001). \n \nThe better-understood western North American orogenic belt or \"Cordillera\" (Fig. 1) \nwas the first to be interpreted as a collage of \u2018suspect\u2019 terranes (as summarized by \nConey et al. 1980) \u2013 terranes being fault-bounded blocks of the Earth\u2019s crust \ncharacterized by a geological history distinct from that of adjacent terranes.  This \nmodel has been widely and successfully applied to many ancient orogenic belts.  One \nimportant aspect of the model is that some of the terranes in a collage may have \ntravelled great distances from their places of origin to their final location adjacent to \nother terranes or the continental margin.  This may have occurred either across oceans \nor along a continental margin by transcurrent faulting (e.g., Keppie & Dallmeyer \n1987; Mankinen et al. 1996; Cowan et al. 1997; Takemura et al. 2002).  The terrane \nmodel was applied early in its inception to parts of the Pacific margin of Gondwana \n(Coombs et al. 1976; Bradshaw et al. 1981; Weaver et al. 1984; Murray et al. 1987). \nIt is now almost universally accepted that terrane-style tectonics are of major \nimportance in the development of orogenic belts.   \n \nUnderstanding of the \u201cAustralide\u201d orogen (Fig. 1) and the role of terrane processes in \nits development has progressed rapidly during the last decade.  There are several \nreasons for this: \n \n1. There has been increasing realization that problems of tectonic correlation \nwithin the orogen are best solved by comparisons between the now-dispersed \nparts of the belt.  Increasing knowledge of formerly less-well known parts of \n 7\nthe orogen and greater international co-operation in sharing such knowledge \n(notably through UNESCO-funded International Geological Correlation \nProgrammes, such as IGCP 436 \u201cPacific Gondwana Margin\u201d) have been \nimportant.  The formerly adjacent parts of the orogen may have been either \nsediment sources or terrane sources (e.g., Adams et al. 1998; Cawood et al. \n2002). \n2. The advent of routine, accurate and precise U\/Pb dating of zircons has led to \nmore refined correlation of events and provided information on the \nprovenance of the huge piles of quartz-bearing sediments that characterize \nmuch of the orogen (e.g., Ireland et al. 1998; Fergusson & Fanning 2002; \nHerv\u00e9 et al. 2003; Schwartz & Gromet 2004; Wandres et al. 2004).  Advances \nin the routine application of 40Ar\/39Ar dating have also been beneficial to \nprovenance studies as well as the dating of deformation events (Adams & \nKelley 1998; Vaughan et al. 2002).   \n3. Improved geochemical analytical methods for analysing trace and rare earth \nelements in volcanic rocks (especially ICP-MS), and greater understanding of \ntheir compositional variations has lead to growing confidence in assigning \ntectonic settings to the volcanic arcs that are key elements in the orogenic belt \nfor palaeotectonic reconstructions (e.g., Glen et al. 1998; Spandler et al. 2004; \nWang et al. 2004). \n4. Increased use of remote sensing techniques and improved regional \ncompilations of data, especially magnetic potential field, has been highly \neffective in mapping and characterizing terrane boundaries, especially when \nsubmerged or covered by surficial deposits or ice (e.g., Ferraccioli & Bozzo \n1999; Sutherland 1999; Direen & Crawford 2003).  \n 8\n5. Palaeontological discoveries and better biostratigraphical correlation have \nbeen important in the recognition that terrane activity continued into the \nMesozoic and have provided qualitative estimates of terrane transport \ndirections and distances (Benedetto 1998; Fang et al. 1998; Kelly et al. 2001; \nCawood et al. 2002).   \n \nThis book is the first to provide an overview of understanding of the terrane model as \nit applies to the Australide accretionary orogeny on the Pacific margin of Gondwana.  \nIt reviews the work of research groups from North and South America, Europe and \nOceania who are engaged in active research on the nature of the Gondwana margin \nand the accretionary orogeny (Regions covered by chapters of this book are indicated \non Figure 2.).  This volume offers a snapshot of current thinking and current research \ndirections, and a guide for any researcher currently active or about to embark on \nstudies in this dynamic area of investigation.  We judge that now is the correct time to \nsummarize recent progress, and highlight the scientific questions that are currently \nengaging those active in the field and that will drive future research. \n \nNomenclature \n \nAccording to Coney et al. (1980), terranes \u2018are characterized by internal homogeneity \nand continuity of stratigraphy, tectonic style and history\u2019.  They stated that \n\u2018boundaries between terranes are fundamental discontinuities in stratigraphy that \ncannot be explained easily by conventional facies changes or unconformity\u2019.  The \nfundamental features of terranes are therefore that (a) their boundaries are major \nfaults, and (b) they have different geological histories to adjacent terranes.  These \n 9\nfeatures are summarized in our preferred definition of terranes as \u2018a fault-bounded \npackage of rocks of regional extent characterized by a geologic history that differs \nfrom that of neighbouring terranes\u2019 (Howell et al. 1985; Friend et al. 1988).  \nRecognition of terranes is not based on any inferences about distance travelled or \nrelative movement between adjacent terranes (Parfenov et al. 2000).  Terranes are \n\u2018suspect\u2019 if there is doubt about their palaeographical setting with respect to adjacent \nterranes or continental margins (Coney et al. 1980; Coombs 1997).  Terranes may be \ndescribed as \u2018exotic\u2019, \u2018far-travelled\u2019 or allochthonous\u2019 (all meaning about the same \nthing) if there is sufficient evidence that they originated far from their present \nlocations, often assumed to be hundreds or thousands of kilometres away; however, \nthese distances need not be particularly large in areas of complex geology (Coombs \n1997).  Problems of definition have been discussed in the literature (e.g., Seng\u00f6r & \nDewey 1991), mainly from perspectives of recursion, i.e., is a seamount in an \naccretionary complex a separate terrane or just part of the complex, and problems of \nlateral and\/or vertical extent, i.e., how small, or large, can a terrane be (Seng\u00f6r 1990). \n \nDevelopment of the terrane concept \n \nRecognition that fragments of continental margins had moved long distances came, in \nthe late 1940\u2019s and early 1950\u2019s, from the discovery that transcurrent faults had \nhundreds of kilometres of offset (Kennedy 1946; Hill & Dibblee 1953; Wellman \n1955).  Coombs (1997), in a brief review of the terrane concept, pointed out that the \nterm \u201cterrane\u201d was in use as early as the 1920\u2019s and 1930\u2019s, but that modern usage \nstemmed from the work of Irwin (1964; 1972) in the western Cordillera of the United \nStates.  Following further conceptual development in the 1970\u2019s in western North \n 10\nAmerica and New Zealand (Berg et al. 1972; Monger et al. 1972; Blake et al. 1974; \nConey 1978; Howell 1980), the concept of terranes, or terrane collages, as possibly \nfar-travelled, fault-bounded blocks with geological histories different from that of \nadjacent blocks, was crystallized by Coney et al. (1980).  The model was quickly \ntested in other orogens (e.g., Bradshaw et al. 1981; Williams & Hatcher 1982; Ziegler \n1982; Pigram & Davies 1987), and large numbers of \u2018suspect\u2019 terranes were identified \nin most.  In the case of the lower Palaeozoic Caledonian\u2013Appalachian orogen in \nScandinavia, the British Isles and eastern USA and Canada, terranes were sandwiched \nbetween continents on opposing sides of the closing Iapetus Ocean (Williams & \nHatcher 1982; Hutton 1987; Pickering et al. 1988; Rankin et al. 1988; Hibbard 2000; \nRoberts 2003).  This orogen, therefore, had a phase of accretionary tectonics prior to \ncontinent\u2013continent collision.  As outlined above, studies of the margin of the Pacific \nbasin were instrumental in the creation of the terrane concept and have provided the \nimpetus for its continued development.  In the past ten years, the fundamental \nimportance of terrane processes in generating and stabilizing continental lithosphere \nhas become apparent from studies of the Altaid belts of Asia (Seng\u00f6r et al. 1993; \nSeng\u00f6r & Natalin 1996) and the orogens that comprise eastern Australia (Foster & \nGray 2000) - a system comprehensively reviewed by Glen (2005) in this volume.  \nApplication of these ideas to older rocks indicates that terrane amalgamation and \naccretionary orogenesis may be the most important processes in formation of the \ncontinental lithosphere through time (Polat & Kerrich 2001). \n \nTerrane processes \n \n 11\nThe key processes of terrane formation are accretion and dispersal.  Accretion (or \n\"docking\" (Twiss & Moores 1992)) is the process by which material incorporated in, \nor transported by, oceanic plates is added to subducting margins, usually separated \nfrom the adjacent, over-riding oceanic or continental plate by a narrow zone called a \nsuture (Howell 1989).  Sutures may be marked by belts of ophiolitic (e.g., Johnson et \nal. 2003) or high pressure rocks, such as blueschists (e.g., Kapp et al. 2003), but \nsurvival of these rocks is not essential to the definition and sutures may also be \nrepresented by strike-slip faults, thrusts or zones of m\u00e9lange (e.g., Abdelsalam et al. \n2003; Pavlis et al. 2004).  Suture zones are not exclusive to accretionary orogens \n(e.g., Vaughan & Johnston 1992).  Dispersal is the process by which fragments are \ndetached or redistributed from the overriding plate at active margins during \nsubduction or ridge crest\u2013trench collision (e.g., Nelson et al. 1994; Keppie et al. \n2003) by rifting (e.g., Umhoefer & Dorsey 1997), strike-slip faulting (e.g., Cawood et \nal. 2002) or thrusting (e.g., Fritz 1996).  Both accretion and dispersal result in new \nterranes, either by adding previously separate geological entities such as oceanic \nplateaus or sea-mounts to oceanic margins, or by removing pieces of existing margins \nand transporting them elsewhere.  The third main process is amalgamation (e.g., \nBluck 1990), by which existing terranes are combined into larger, composite terrane \ncollages or superterranes, ultimately forming stable parts of the continental \nlithosphere.  Examination of Cenozoic to Recent active accretionary orogens in \nsoutheast Asia suggests that the interaction between accretion, dispersal and \namalgamation can be extremely complex with geologically very rapid changes that \nmay not be recognized in older orogens without high resolution dating (Hall 2002).  \nOther important terrane processes happen after accretion, dispersal or amalgamation.  \nThese are the formation of sedimentary or volcanic overlap sequences and \n 12\nemplacement of igneous complexes that \"stitch\" terrane sutures and place time limits \non terrane motion (e.g., Gardner et al. 1988; Raeside & Barr 1990; Herzig & Sharp \n1992). \n \nTypes of terrane \n \nThe common terrane rock types tend to be similar from orogen to orogen and we have \ngrouped these into several main associations.  The most common types in \nPhanerozoic orogens around the world are marginal to the ocean basins and can \nencompass any type of continental or oceanic lithosphere, either with or without a \nmantle root.  Most common, non-genetic (i.e. what a geologist would see at outcrop in \nthe field) where possible, terrane rock type associations, based on the Australides (this \nbook and references therein) western American Cordillera, Caledonian\u2013Appalachian, \ncentral and eastern Asia orogens (Coney et al. 1980; Williams & Hatcher 1982; \nHutton 1987; Parfenov et al. 2000; Badarch et al. 2002; Xiao et al. 2004), are: \n \n1. Turbidite terranes.  These are volumetrically very significant, forming large \nparts of the accretionary orogens in New Zealand (e.g., Leverenz & Ballance \n2001; Mortimer 2004), Australia (e.g., Foster & Gray 2000), eastern Asia \n(e.g., Seng\u00f6r & Okurogullari 1991), the western North American Cordillera \n(e.g., Rubin & Saleeby 1991; McClelland et al. 1992) and in Palaeozoic \norogens of northwest Europe and eastern North America (e.g., Keppie 1985b; \nLeggett 1987; Lehmann et al. 1995; Ryan & Smith 1998).  They comprise \nthick piles of deep marine sediments, probably representing submarine fans, \nand are often imbricated by thrusting (e.g., Kusky & Bradley 1999).  They are \n 13\ncommonly siliciclastic, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Adams \net al. 1998; Ireland et al. 1998), but substantial calcareous complexes also \nexist (e.g., Robertson & Ustaomer 2004; Wilson et al. 2004).  Parfenov et al. \n(2000) subdivided these terranes into three types: two accretionary complex \ntypes with greater or lesser proportions of basaltic rocks, and a non-\naccretionary type where the evolutionary history of the turbidite succession is \nless certain (e.g., possibly dispersed from a passive continental margin but \nwith no subsequent incorporation in a subduction complex).  Turbidite \nterranes are commonly metamorphosed (e.g., Herv\u00e9 & Fanning 2001), from \nanchimetamorphic up to blueschist and amphibolite grade, and associated \nbrittle-ductile and ductile deformation is common (e.g., Wang & Lu 1997; \nWillner et al. 2004). \n \n2. Tectonic and sedimentary m\u00e9lange terranes.  These are commonly associated \nwith turbidite terranes, particularly those generated in a subduction \nenvironment (e.g., Ernst 1993; Kusky & Bradley 1999), and often occur along \nterrane sutures (e.g., Aitchison et al. 2002) or at major boundaries within \naccretionary complex terranes (e.g., Silberling et al. 1988).  They commonly \nconsist of altered basalt and serpentinite, chert, limestone, greywacke, shale, \nand metamorphic rock fragments (including blueschist) in a fine-grained \nsheared and cleaved mudstone matrix (e.g., Aalto 1981; Cloos 1983; Carayon \net al. 1984; Maekawa et al. 2004). \n \n3. Magmatic terranes.  These can be predominantly mafic or predominantly \nfelsic, reflecting the geological environment in which they formed.  Mafic \n 14\nmagmatic terranes are dominated by volcanic and plutonic rocks, usually \npillow basalts associated with volcanogenic and pelagic sediments (e.g., \nTakemura et al. 2002), subaerial flood basalts (e.g., Richards et al. 1991), \nsheeted dyke complexes (e.g., Lapierre et al. 2003), and mid-lower crustal \nlithologies dominated by mafic and ultramafic plutonic complexes (e.g., \nDeBari & Sleep 1991; Shervais et al. 2004). In some cases, related ultramafic \nrocks in mafic magmatic terranes may be of mantle origin (Fitzherbert et al. \n2004).  Most mafic magmatic terranes are interpreted to have been generated \nby either sea-floor spreading, oceanic intraplate magmatism, or in volcanic arc \nenvironments, although terranes derived from dispersal of continental flood \nbasalt magmatic rocks are also known (e.g., Song et al. 2004).  The products \nof sea-floor spreading include ophiolites and other fragments of oceanic \nbasement that were commonly produced in back-arc settings (e.g., Bluck et al. \n1980; Cawood & Suhr 1992; B\u00e9dard 1999; Yumul 2003; Piercey et al. 2004).  \nTerranes derived from sea-floor volcanic eruptions include oceanic plateaus \nformed by oceanic flood eruptions (e.g., Wrangellia terrane, Richards et al. \n1991; Hikurangi Plateau, Mortimer & Parkinson 1996), as well as seamounts \nand ocean islands (e.g., Jacobi & Wasowski 1985; Barker et al. 1988; \nDoubleday et al. 1994).  Mafic magmatic terranes are commonly intra-oceanic \nand formed on oceanic rather than continental crust (e.g., Weaver et al. 1984; \nDeBari & Sleep 1991; Rubin & Saleeby 1991; Miller & Christensen 1994).  \nDominantly felsic magmatic terranes mostly consist of broadly calc-alkaline, \nplutonic rocks that represent the interiors of volcanic arcs, although some may \nrepresent dispersed fragments of older felsic continental crust, possibly craton-\nderived, reincorporated in later orogens (e.g., Boger et al. 2001).  In addition \n 15\nto rocks of the calc-alkaline suite, a common association in felsic magmatic \nterranes is the tonalite\u2013trondhjemite\u2013granodiorite suite (e.g., Smithies 2000).  \nThe Phanerozoic equivalents of these rocks are called adakites and their origin \nis controversial (e.g., Defant et al. 2002; Kay & Kay 2002).  They are thought \nto be generated by high heat flow in several subduction-related settings where \npartial melting took place in the garnet stability zone, > ~40 km depth, with \nend member models implicating either young subducting slab or partial \nmelting of mafic lower arc crust (e.g., Defant et al. 2002; Kay & Kay 2002).  \nTerranes with rocks of this suite are typified by the \u2018Median batholith\u2019 and \ncentral magmatic arcs of South Island, New Zealand (Muir et al. 1998; \nMortimer et al. 1999).  Similar plutonic rocks are interpreted, from seismic \nevidence, to characterize some modern oceanic arcs (e.g., Suyehiro et al. \n1996).  Some felsic magmatic terranes, or at least some sequences within \nthem, are dominated by felsic volcanic rocks at exposure level (e.g., Clift & \nRyan 1994; MacDonald et al. 1996; Bryan et al. 2001), which are interpreted \nto be the erupted equivalents of arc and back-arc pluton, although dispersed \nterranes derived from continental rhyolite large igneous province magmatism \nare known (e.g., Heatherington & Mueller 2003). \n \n4. Non-turbidite clastic, carbonate or evaporite sedimentary terranes.  These \nterranes fall into two categories: well-bedded, shallow marine, fluvial, or \nterrestrial sequences, probably representing platform, rift margin, or shallow \nbasin deposition, and a category consisting of massive limestones.  Well-\nbedded terrane sequences often represent dispersed fragments of continental \nmargin rocks, including clastic and volcaniclastic sediments (e.g., Campbell et \n 16\nal. 2001; Noda et al. 2004), carbonates (e.g., Gaetani et al. 2004) and \nevaporites (e.g., Thomas et al. 2001), but can also be deposits from arc-related \nbasins (e.g., fore-arc Nichols & Cantrill 2002) or aulacogens (failed rifts) (e.g., \nZolnai 1986).  Massive limestones are often masses scraped off seamount \nsummits in accretionary complexes (e.g., Kimura et al. 1994; Stevens et al. \n1997; Cawood et al. 2002). \n \n5. Terrane collages.  These consist of composite terranes formed by \namalgamation of some or all of the above terrane types (e.g., the Argentine \nPrecordillera (Thomas et al. 2002) and Avalonia (Nance et al. 2004)), with the \nadded complication of internal sutures as well as internal overlap and stitch \nassemblages. \n \nSize of terranes \n \nThis is a difficult subject.  As with many natural objects, it is easier to know what \nsomething is than it is to define it.  Parfenov et al. (2000) placed a lower size limit on \nterranes by defining them as units that can be mapped at the 1:5,000,000 scale, \nalthough they admitted that size limits are largely arbitrary.  Seng\u00f6r (1990) argued \nthat nappes and blocks in m\u00e9lange units should not be considered terranes, but more \nrecent work would suggest that there is no effective lower size limit (m\u00e9lange zones, \nfor example, can be argued to consist of an arbitrarily large number of faults (e.g., \nChang et al. 2001) \u2013 any exotic block in a m\u00e9lange zone is, therefore, fault bounded \nand could be considered a terrane, although this is an extreme case).  Composite \nterranes can be very large (e.g., modern New Zealand could be considered a \n 17\ncomposite terrane), and although composite terranes should be smaller than \ncontinents, there is no arbitrary upper limit to terrane size. \n \nCurrent research themes \n \nThe study of tectonic plates in terms of terranes is called \u201cterrane analysis\u201d (e.g., \nHowell & Howell 1995).  Once a terrane has been recognized, by identification of its \nbounding faults, the next component of terrane analysis is characterization (e.g., \nSamson et al. 1990; Lapierre et al. 1992), which uses standard geological techniques \nsuch as mapping, geophysics (e.g., Brown 1991; Ferraccioli et al. 2002; Armadillo et \nal. 2004), sample collection and follow-up laboratory work etc.  It is then necessary to \ndetermine the relationship between the terrane and the adjacent continental margin \nand other neighbouring terranes (e.g., Samson et al. 1991); this is often in \ncombination with efforts to characterize a terrane.  In most cases, especially in \nPalaeozoic orogens, it is easy to designate a terrane as \u2018suspect\u2019, but difficult to prove \nthat it is exotic to the continental margin and its immediately adjacent marginal seas.  \nSeveral techniques exist for testing the origin of a terrane (Howell & Howell 1995).  \nWhere a terrane is suspect, techniques to determine qualitative or semi-quantitative \nestimates of absolute movement include palaeontology (e.g., Smith et al. 2001; \nBelasky et al. 2002; Cawood et al. 2002; Kottachchi et al. 2002), palaeomagnetism \n(e.g., Johnston 2001; Keppie & Dostal 2001) and palaeoenvironmental studies (e.g., \nCondie & Chomiak 1996; Monger 1997; Trop et al. 2002).  Some techniques do not \ngive movement information directly, but can determine what relationship a terrane has \nto adjacent terranes and\/or determine its ultimate origin.  These include petrology \n(e.g., Barr 1990; Restrepopace 1992), isotope geochemistry (e.g., Samson et al. 1990; \n 18\nLeat et al. 2005), geochronology (e.g., Herrmann et al. 1994; Weber & Kohler 1999), \nprovenance studies of sandstones (e.g., Ireland et al. 1998; Friedl et al. 2000; Adams \net al. 2002; Adams et al. 2005) and conglomerates (Wandres & Bradshaw 2005, this \nvolume), and sediment geochemistry (e.g., Willan 2003).  Of the provenance \ntechniques U\u2013Pb and Hf isotope dating and fingerprinting of zircon are particularly \nimportant because, in addition to age, they provide information about evolution of the \ncrustal sources (Bodet & Sch\u00e4rer 2000; Friedl et al. 2000; Knudsen et al. 2001; \nGriffin et al. 2004).  A second approach to characterizing terranes and identifying \ntheir origins comes from comparison with modern analogues.  For example, the \nJapan\u2013Izu Bonin arc collision (e.g., Kawate & Arima 1998; Soh et al. 1998) is a \nmodern active example of accretion of a primitive magmatic arc to a composite \nmicrocontinental arc terrane.  Taiwan preserves an active arc\u2013continent collision zone \nbetween the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate (e.g., Fuh et al. 1997; Chang \net al. 2001).  The situation in Southeast Asia is complex and shows evidence for very \nrapid changes in plate boundaries on geological timescales, commonly coeval \ncompressional and extensional regimes and abundant strike-slip (Hall 2002).  Pigram \n& Davies identified as many as 48 Cenozoic terranes in Papua New Guinea\/Irian Jaya \nand the region shows a long history of terrane processes (Metcalfe 1994).  The arc\u2013\ncontinent collision between Australia and Indonesia\/Papua New Guinea (e.g., Abbott \net al. 1994), which is complicated by Pacific Plate interactions (e.g., Hall 2002), \nshows features of terrane dispersal even as terrane accretion is underway (e.g., \nMilsom et al. 1999), and includes an active collision zone between a submarine \nplateau (Ontong-Java) and the Melanesian arc (e.g., Hall 2002).  Many of the features \nthat developed during the Cenozoic development of the region of Southeast Asia and \nthe southwest Pacific are at odds with interpretations of older accretionary orogens \n 19\n(R. Hall personal communication 2004) and the reasons for this mismatch are so far \nunexplained.  The Lesser Antilles, by showing a system where sediments derived \nfrom a primitive arc mix with sediments that are cratonically derived, provide a \nmodern analogue that illustrates the potential complexities of provenance analysis \nbased on sediments (e.g., Marsaglia & Ingersoll 1992; Faugeres et al. 1993; Leitch et \nal. 2003).  Aerogeophysical techniques provide powerful tools for identifying terrane \nextents and boundaries in areas of ice (e.g., Ferraccioli et al. 2002) or thick sediment \ncover (e.g., Chernicoff & Zappettini 2003).  Another approach in characterizing and \nsourcing terranes is to determine the composition and gross structure of the terrane \ndeep-lithosphere.  This can be done by examining the compositions of deeply sourced \nmagmas such as primitive mafic dykes and the compositions of any xenoliths they \nmay have carried from depth (e.g., Yu et al. 2003; Leat et al. 2005, this volume), or \nby quantifying the structure of the lithosphere using energy from distant seismic \nsources such as earthquakes (e.g., Reading et al. 2003; Reading 2005, this volume) or \nmagnetotellurics (e.g., Ledo et al. 2004).   \n \nTerrane studies on the margin of Gondwana  \n \nNew Zealand \n \nNew Zealand was one of the places where the terrane concept was developed (Blake \net al. 1974; Coombs et al. 1976; Howell 1980; Coombs 1997) and one of the first \nparts of the Gondwana margin where the terrane concept of Coney et al. (1980) was \napplied (Bradshaw et al. 1981).  The terrane model has proved highly successful in \nunderstanding the pre-Late Cretaceous evolution of the region.  It has been well tested \n 20\n(Bradshaw 1989; Adams & Kelley 1998; Cawood et al. 1999; Sivell & McCulloch \n2000; Mortimer & Cooper 2004), and there have been no competing models for the \nlast twenty years.  Early Palaeozoic terranes form a Western Province of Gondwana \naffinity, which is separated from late Palaeozoic to Mesozoic accreted terranes of an \nEastern Province by a Median Tectonic Zone or batholith (Mortimer et al. 1999) that \nconsists of late Palaeozoic to Mesozoic igneous rocks.  The first-accreted Eastern \nProvince terranes include ultramafic rocks (such as the type dunites of Dun Mountain: \nCoombs et al. 1976).  Wandres & Bradshaw (2005, this volume) review New \nZealand\u2019s terranes and present new data on their origins using provenance of clasts in \nconglomerate deposits, arguing that the Antarctic Sector of the Gondwana margin is a \nmajor source of detritus.  Similarly, Adams et al. (2005, this volume), use Sr and Nd \nisotopes of metasedimentary sequences in the \"Australides\" from Australia to \nsouthern South America to characterize Gondwana margin accretionary complexes \nand the nature of their sources.  A simple conclusion of this work is that at any one \ntime material of different origins was being deposited and accreted in different parts \nof the orogen, and that the accretion history of West Antarctica and southern South \nAmerica is distinct from that of New Zealand. \n \nAustralia \n \nThe Tasman orogenic system \u2018Tasmanides\u2019 of Australia occupies the eastern third of \nthe Australian continent.  It consists of several orogenic belts whose age of \ndeformation and accretion decreases from west to east (Murray et al. 1987; Coney et \nal. 1990; Fl\u00f6ttmann et al. 1993; Glen et al. 1998; Ireland et al. 1998; Fergusson 2003; \nMcElhinny et al. 2003).  The Early Palaeozoic Delamerian orogeny formed as \n 21\nNeoproterozoic and Cambrian sedimentary and volcanic arc terranes were accreted \nalong the formerly passive margin of the western Australian Precambrian continental \ncore.  This orogen an along-strike correlative of the Ross orogeny in Antarctica \n(Stump et al. 1986; Fl\u00f6ttmann et al. 1993).  To the east, the Early Palaeozoic Lachlan \nand Thomson fold belts represent accretion of Cambrian to Silurian volcanic arcs and \ndominantly siliciclastic sediments to the margin (e.g., McElhinny et al. 2003).  The \neastern New England orogeny represents accretion of terranes during late Palaeozoic \nto early Mesozoic times.  In this volume, Glen (2005) comprehensively reviews \ncurrent models for the development of the Tasman orogenic system and identifies \nthree supercycles of sedimentation and deformation.  His proposed model is one of \nessentially continuous accretionary orogeny at the Pacific margin of eastern Australia \nsince Neoproterozoic times.  The deep structure of terranes is also important.  \nReading (2005, this volume) presents a new technique for imaging the deep roots of \nsouthwestern and southeastern Australian terranes and terranes boundaries using \nearthquake seismic data. \n \nSouth America \n \nThe first ideas that the South American margin might consist of accreted terranes was \npresented in relation to a Permian carbonate fragment in southern Chile known as the \nMadre de Dios terrane (Mpodozis & Forsythe 1983).  Subsequent work on most of the \nmeta-sedimentary rocks of the southernmost Pacific Andean margin has shown that \nthey do not represent Palaeozoic Gondwana basement as once supposed, but are best \ninterpreted as Mesozoic accreted material (Herv\u00e9 1988; Fang et al. 1998; Herv\u00e9 & \nFanning 2003).  East of the Andes, the Argentine Precordillera is widely regarded as a \n 22\nlarge-scale exotic terrane derived from Laurentia and accreted during the Early \nPalaeozoic (e.g., Ramos et al. 1986; Moore 1994; Astini et al. 1995; Thomas & Astini \n2003).  Much research has been focused on refining models for the history of this \nPrecordillera or Cuyania terrane.  Nevertheless, others have disputed its Laurentian \nderivation, preferring an autochthonous origin within Gondwana (Ace\u00f1olaza et al. \n2002).  It is notable that geochronology and detrital zircon analysis have been central \nto the development of both sides of this controversy (Casquet et al. 2001; Thomas et \nal. 2004; Finney et al. in press).  In any event, it is becoming increasingly obvious \nthat western South America retains a fragmentary record of high-grade Proterozoic \nmetamorphic rocks coeval with the Grenville belt of North America (e.g., Thomas et \nal. 2004).  Cordani et al. (2005, this volume) present new evidence for Proterozoic, \nGrenvillian fragments in the Columbian Andes, and Casquet et al. (in press) have \nidentified Grenville-age massif anorthosites in western Argentina, comparable to \nthose of the Grenville province.  This \u2018southern Grenville belt\u2019 may well represent a \ncommon orogeny linking Laurentia and \u2018Western Gondwana\u2019 within Rodinia. \nAnother aspect of importance in terrane accretion is the tectonic history of the \ncollision zone.  Miller & S\u00f6llner (2005, this volume) present evidence that the \nFamatina Complex represents autochthonous arc\u2013continent collision on the \nGondwana margin in Late Proterozoic to Ordovician times, which could be related to \naccretion of the Precordillera terrane.  Zimmermann (2005, this volume) uses new \nprovenance data from Late Proterozoic to Cambrian sediments of the Puncoviscana \nbasin to show that the rocks represent a peripheral foreland basin succession to the \nPampean orogeny.  As a counterpoint to terrane interpretations of southern South \nAmerica, Lucassen & Franz (2005, this volume) present an alternative history for the \n 23\nearly Palaeozoic of the Central Andes proposing a non-terrane, tectonic situation \nsimilar to the present day.  \nAttempts to view the rest of South America in terrane terms were advanced by \nBernasconi (1987) for the Precambrian and Ramos (1988) for the Phanerozoic.  The \ncurrent stage is one where the identification and characterization of terranes in poorly \nexposed or poorly studied areas, which potentially include Patagonia, has not been \nconvincingly demonstrated.  Geophysical evidence is crucial in such in such \ncircumstances (e.g., Chernicoff & Zappettini 2003).  Rapalini (2005, this volume) \nreviews southern South American terranes from east to west, and provides new \ninsights into key events during Gondwana assembly in the Neoproterozoic to Late \nPalaeozoic from the perspective of palaeomagnetic data.  Rapela et al. (2005, this \nvolume) identify a previously unknown Early Jurassic magmatic arc and show that \nmagmatism in the Triassic\u2013Jurassic interval reveal a rotational tectonic regime which \nshould be a major constraint on the plate configuration of Patagonia and the \nrelationship between southern South America and the Antarctic Peninsula in pre-\nbreak-up Gondwana reconstructions. \n \nAntarctica \n \nThe ice cover of most of both East and West Antarctica has hampered regional \ncorrelations.  Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that most of East \nAntarctica consists of a collage of Archaean blocks and Proterozoic belts that were \nfinally stabilized in their current configuration during the Pan-African orogeny (c. \n700\u2013500 Ma) when the Mozambique Ocean separating East and West Gondwana \nclosed to form the Gondwana continent (Fitzsimons 2000a, b; Boger et al. 2002; \n 24\nJacobs et al. 2003).  Closure of this ocean around the end of Precambrian times \nformed the continuous Pacific margin of the Gondwana continent along which the \nPalaeozoic to Mesozoic orogenic belts developed (Fig. 1).  During the Mesozoic \nbreak-up of Gondwana, West Antarctica behaved as several crustal blocks separated \nby rift and strike-slip deformation zones (Dalziel & Elliot 1982).  Stone & Thomson \n(2005, this volume) present fossil evidence that supports rotation of the Falklands \nmicroplate during Gondwana break-up and has implications for the extent of the \nGondwanide ice sheet.  Siddoway et al. (2005, this volume) show new evidence for \nstrike-slip movements affecting West Antarctica during the Cretaceous just prior to \nthe rifting-off from Gondwana of New Zealand (Laird & Bradshaw 2004).  West \nAntarctica appears to mostly consist of crust accreted to the Antarctic margin during \nCambrian to Cretaceous times.  Terranes were first identified in the Ross orogeny of \nthe Transantarctic Mountains where Cambrian sedimentary and volcanic arc terranes \nwere accreted to the margin in Cambrian times (Weaver et al. 1984; Stump 1995).  \nThe extent to which these terranes are exotic to the Gondwana margin is a matter of \ncurrent debate and Tessensohn & Henjes-Kunst (2005, this volume) present a \nreview of the most recent results and models. \n \nWest Antarctica appears to consist of Early Palaeozoic to Mesozoic provinces, at \nleast some of which are \"suspect\" (e.g., Pankhurst et al. 1998; Vaughan & Storey \n2000; Millar et al. 2002).  Rocks of Proterozoic age (1176 \u00b1 76 Ma, Millar & \nPankhurst 1987) crop out in just one location in West Antarctica, at Haag Nunataks. \nThere is continuing uncertainty whether this is an isolated far-travelled terrane \nderived from a continental margin, a fragment of the Gondwana core or whether it \nrepresents more extensive Proterozoic basement to West Antarctica, as indicated by \n 25\nisotope studies of granites and xenoliths (Millar et al. 2001; Handler et al. 2003). \nLeat et al. (2005) shed some light on this by using lithosphere-derived mafic magmas \nto determine differences in lithospheric mantle composition beneath Antarctica. \n \nOther parts of the Gondwana margin \n \nStudies of the interaction between Gondwana and Laurentia have been an important \ndriver of orogenic theory.  When Wilson (1966) asked if the Atlantic had closed and \nthen reopened, the closure he referred to was between Gondwana and Laurentia.  \nWilliams & Hatcher (1982; 1983) demonstrated that this closure had incorporated \nmany exotic terranes in one of the first demonstrations of the utility of the terrane \ncollage model of Coney et al. (1980).  Hibbard et al. (2005, this volume) present a \nre-examination of the Gondwana\u2013Laurentia terrane-collision orogeny in the Carolina \nZone of the Appalachian belt and present a new model for middle Palaeozoic \ninteractions of the Appalachian peri-Gondwanan realm with Laurentia. \n \nSome suggestions for the future \n \nGeological mapping, augmented by geochronology, geochemistry, palaeontology, and \naerogeophysical methods, continues to be the foundation stone of terrane analysis.  \nNew techniques such as 1-D seismic analysis, Hf-isotope investigation of zircon, and \nxenolith studies promise to provide further new insights into terrane deep structure \nand provenance.  Geophysical studies, integrated with geological field data, are \nallowing us to better predict what lies beneath the ice of Antarctica.  Despite the many \nrecent advances, there are still some significant gaps in our knowledge.  1-D seismic \n 26\nstudies would benefit from increased Antarctic coverage of permanent seismic data \nrecorders, which is low relative to other continents.  Hf-isotope studies are currently \nhampered by incomplete sets of representative Hf data from potential source rocks for \nGondwana terranes.  In a sense we need to know the \"Hf of the world\" to give us \nmore confidence in our interpretation of Gondwana provenance data and, to this end, \nwe recommend that all zircon mounts that have been dated by the U-Pb SHRIMP \nmethod are analysed in-situ for Hf.  In regional terms, linking the Australia\u2013New \nZealand sector of the Australides with the South American sector is made more \ndifficult by a gap in geological and high-resolution aerogeophysical data in the Pine \nIsland Bay area of Ellsworth Land.  This area is currently a target of glaciological \nresearch, but it needs to be made a key target for geology and aerogeophysics.  It is \nclear that the long period of Phanerozoic subduction beneath this margin had a large \nimpact on mantle evolution of the southern hemisphere.  However, there is a need for \nmore robust regional models \u2013 building on excellent local data sets \u2013 for the origin \nand relationship of the diverse mantle reservoirs that have sourced magmatism in the \nAustralides.  A deeper understanding of terrane processes is likely to result from \ncloser comparisons between the Australides and the Cenozoic accretionary orogens of \nSoutheast Asia, and the southwest Pacific, by re-assessing data and interpretations of \nolder orogens in the context of the well-constrained processes and events described \nfrom Cenozoic margins.  In simple terms, we should look for analogues of Mesozoic, \nand older, processes in younger, better-constrained Cenozoic orogens. \n \nConclusions \n \n 27\nAccretionary orogenesis is a key process of stabilization and formation of the \ncontinental lithosphere.  Terrane theory and terrane analysis represent the framework \nfor understanding the processes of crustal accretion.  The \u201cAustralides\u201d are one of the \nlargest and longest-lived orogens on Earth and have been a key testing ground for the \norigination and development of terrane theory.  Terrane studies continue to be a \nvibrant and active area of research in the \u201cAustralides\u201d, with new techniques and \ninsights emerging on a regular basis.  Many research groups from North and South \nAmerica, Europe and Oceania are active in the region, whose work has provided deep \ninsights into the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic evolution of the orogen and the \nfundamentals of accretionary orogenesis.  The \u201cAustralides\u201d are a key area for terrane \nresearch and here we have attempted to capture the current state of ideas and provide \nan introduction and benchmark for future research. \n \nThe papers in this volume stemmed from work presented at the \"Terrane Processes at the Pacific \nMargin of Gondwana\" meeting held in Cambridge, UK in September 2003 and at the 10th Chilean \nGeological Congress held in Concepci\u00f3n in October 2003, as well as invited contributions.
