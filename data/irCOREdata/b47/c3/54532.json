MODELING OF BLAC MOTOR AcCOUNTING FOR DQ-Axis\nposition sensor in permanent magnet (PM) brushless AC CROSS-COUPLING MAGNETIC SATURATION AND IMPROVED\n(BLAC) drives, by employing a sensorless technique. While EXTENDED BACK-EMF BASED SENSORLESS METHOD\nsignal injection based sensorless schemes can successfully The 3-phase voltages of a BLAC motor are given by:\nestimate the rotor position at standstill and low speeds [1],\nback-EMF based sensorless techniques are only applicable to Fva1 Rs 0 0 ia dVldt\nhigher speeds [2]-[4]. Hence, it is common to employ a hybrid a L R 0 i 1+1 dw Idt (1)\nsensorless technique, which uses both a signal injection based b IIsi\nmethod and a back-EMF based method [5]. Back-EMF based LvC 0 0 RS icL dVfcldt\nsensorless methods were first developed to estimate the rotor where va, vb, vc ia, ib, ic, V1a, Vib and are the 3-phase voltages,\nposition of BLAC motors having a surface-mounted PM rotor currents, and flux-linkages, respectively, and Rs is the phase\nwithout rotor magnetic saliency. They were then extended to . ' '\nBLAC motors having different d-axis and q-axis inductances rsi\n[2]-[4], which led to the 'extended' back-EMF method in which\nthe d-axis inductance term was combined with the EMF term in FVd1 FRs 0 ]Fid 1 F dvddt - V'qV (2)\norder to make the impedance matrix of the dq-axis voltage vqK L \u00b0 d Vfq Idt + Co,fd\nequations symmetrical. In [2], the influence of magnetic L s q r\nsaturation was neglected, and the q-axis apparent inductance where vd, vq, id, iq, Vid, and qiq are the d- and q-axis voltages,\nwas assumed to be constant. Magnetic saturation was currents, and flux-linkages, respectively, and Wr is the rotor\nsubsequently considered in [3] [4]. However, although the electrical angular velocity.

CONCLUSIONS\nThe conventional extended back-EMF based sensorless\ncontrol method has been improved by accounting for\ncross-coupling between the d- and q-axes and magnetic\nsaturation by introducing an apparent mutual winding\ninductance for a permnanent magnet brushless AC motor with\nmagnetic saliency. The error in the estimated rotor position\nwhich arises when cross-coupling and magnetic saturation are\nneglected has been analyzed analytically, predicted by finite\nelement analysis, and confirmned by measurements, for various\nd- and q- axis currents. Measurements confirmn that a significant\nimprovement in the accuracy of the estimated rotor position\nestimation can be achieved by using the proposed extended\nback-EMF based sensorless technique.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.H.
