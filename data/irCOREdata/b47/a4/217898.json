Because of its central location and diverse cultural heritage, the \nabsorption of the princely state of Hyderabad into the Indian Union was an important \ngoal for Nehru\u2019s government. But the task of bringing Hyderabad into the Union was \nnot an easy one. As it entered Hyderabad, the government of independent India had \nto come to terms with the limitations of the police, military and bureaucracy which it \nhad inherited from the colonial state. As it took over the governance of the state, it \nhad to find ways to manage relations between Hindus and Muslims, even as the \nsocial order was being transformed. And it had to fight communism in the Telangana \nregion of the state, whilst trying to ensure the loyalty of its new citizens. This article \nexamines the ways in which India\u2019s first government confronted these complex \nproblems. The following pages argue that these early years must be seen as a time \nof great dynamism, rather than as a period of stability inherited from the colonial \nstate.  \n \nTaylor C. Sherman \n2 \n \nThere is near consensus amongst scholars of postcolonial India that, at least in \nretrospect, the Nehruvian period was one of relative calm and stability. According to \nthis line of thought, independence did herald change in India, including the \nintroduction of democracy with universal suffrage and a constitution with a charter of \nfundamental rights, but the trauma of partition, the war over Kashmir and the \nintegration of the princely states, \u2018ensured that precisely those traits of the Raj which \nIndian nationalists had struggled against were now reinforced\u2019.1 The police, military \nand bureaucracy inherited from the colonial regime, it is agreed, enabled the \nCongress-led government to \u2018enforce central authority\u2019, and to ensure stability in a \nunified Indian state.2   \n \nThe following pages challenge this view by examining the integration of the princely \nstate of Hyderabad into the Indian Union. It is argued that this view posthumously \ninvests the colonial state\/early postcolonial state with qualities it did not have. The \nidea that the colonial state acted as a monolithic machine to stamp out dissent and \ndisorder where it pleased is unsustainable. Central policy was often fraught with \ncontradictions. Institutions, especially the police, courts and prisons, were often \noverwhelmed by the work thrust upon them during times of unrest. Tensions between \nthe centre and local administrators frequently erupted, as officers used their position \nas \u2018the man on the spot\u2019 to act contrary to orders or to justify committing acts of \nviolence against the subject population. Taken as a whole, therefore, the colonial \nstate was often either weak and inefficient or extraordinarily violent and ineffective.3 \nBy taking the absorption of Hyderabad as a case study, this work examines the ways \nin which the new government coped with its inheritance.   \n \nHitherto, the story of the integration of the princely state of Hyderabad into the Indian \nUnion has been told from a number of relatively parochial perspectives. There have \nTaylor C. Sherman \n3 \nbeen personal stories of hardship and bravery during the conflict;4 detailed analyses \nof the tortured negotiations between the Indian government, the Nizam of Hyderabad \nand the British;5 clinical accounts of the military operations;6 and histories of the \ncommunist Telangana movement in the territory.7 None of these accounts, however, \nhave examined the impact of the integration of Hyderabad on the formation of the \nstate in newly independent India.  \n \nThe absorption of Hyderabad provides an excellent study of the nature of the \npostcolonial Indian state for three reasons. First, Hyderabad had been part of the \ncalculations of all-India political parties at least since the 1930s.8 The territory was \ntherefore a vital part of the self-image of newly-independent India. Secondly, it was \nthe Ministry of States, part of the central government in Delhi, which assumed overall \nresponsibility for the integration of the former princely states. After the police action of \nSeptember 1948, the Hyderabad regime was virtually disbanded. As a result, the \nnew authorities had relative freedom to shape the new territory as they pleased. \nFinally, as Hyderabad was brought into the Union, police, military and members of \nthe bureaucracy were drafted in from the rest of India to rebuild Hyderabad. One can \ntherefore use the case of Hyderabad not only to try to understand the \u2018mind\u2019 of the \ncentral government, but to examine the extent to which policies designed by the \ncentre were successfully implemented on the ground. \n \nWhen they assumed power in Hyderabad, the new Indian government faced an array \nof questions the answers to which would impact the shape and character of the new \nnation-state as a whole. These included, how to deal with the limitations of the \nmilitary, police, and bureaucracy which they had inherited; how to frame the new \nconstitution to protect the integrity of the country; how to manage relations between \nHindus and Muslims, whether in the bureaucracy or in the population; and how to \nfight communism and ensure the loyalty of their new citizens. This article explores \nTaylor C. Sherman \n4 \nthese questions in three sections. First, it situates the princely state of Hyderabad at \nthe geographic, economic and cultural heart of the sub-continent, and locates the \nterritory in the vision of India imagined by the British and their Indian successors. \nSecondly, it analyses the ways in which the Indian authorities addressed the question \nof relations between Hindus and Muslims after the fall of the Muslim-led government \nof the Nizam of Hyderabad. Finally, it turns to the ways in which the Indian army, and \nthen the civilian authorities, confronted the communist Telangana movement in the \neastern part of the state. It is argued below that, in the years shortly after \nindependence, India\u2019s internal character had yet to be set in stone, and the \nexperience of the integration of Hyderabad reflects the vibrancy and uncertainty of \nthe early Nehruvian period. \n \nHyderabad and the Indian Union \n \nThe history of the awkward place of the princely states in the transfer of power \nnegotiations is well known.9 On the eve of independence, several large states, \nincluding Hyderabad, had declined to join either India or Pakistan. Each state \npresented its own unique problems, but the Government of independent India \nbelieved that the accession of Hyderabad to the Indian Union was ineluctable. As \nearly as June 1947, Nehru had warned he would \u2018encourage rebellion in all states \nthat go against us\u2019.10 In the new Indian Government, the accession of the \nsubcontinent\u2019s second largest princely state was viewed as a foregone conclusion \nbecause Hyderabad could not be independent except in name, given its geographical \nposition.11 Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India\u2019s Home member and Minister for States \nremarked, \u2018Hyderabad is, as it were, situated in India\u2019s belly. How can the belly \nbreathe if it is cut off from the main body?\u201912 In the summer of 1948, as India\u2019s \nstatesmen, especially Patel, began to hint of an invasion, the British encouraged \nTaylor C. Sherman \n5 \nIndia to avoid using force, but repeatedly declined the Nizam\u2019s requests to intervene \non his behalf.13 \n \nIn the months preceding independence, however, Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan \nBahadur had refused to accede to either India or Pakistan. He attempted, instead, to \nmanoeuvre his state towards independence, from where he could negotiate an \nalliance with India, rather than amalgamation into India.14 To avoid accession, the \nNizam\u2019s government had signed a Standstill Agreement with the Government of \nIndia. The accord provided that relations between the state and the Indian Union \nwould remain for one year as they had been prior to independence. India would \nhandle Hyderabad\u2019s foreign affairs, but Indian Army troops stationed in \nSecunderabad would be removed. Soon after the agreement had been struck, \nhowever, each side began to accuse the other of violating its terms. The Nizam \nalleged that the Indian government was imposing an informal embargo by using its \ncontrol over railways leading into the state to deny the territory vital goods, especially \narms and medical supplies.15 India claimed that the government of Hyderabad was \nedging towards independence by divesting itself of its Indian securities, banning the \nIndian currency, halting the export of ground nuts, organising illegal gun-running from \nPakistan, and inviting new recruits to its army and to its irregular forces, the \nRazakars. These moves were regarded in Delhi as part of a \u2018comprehensive plan to \nbreak up the economic cohesion of India.\u201916  \n \nThe situation in Hyderabad in 1948 \n \nWhile the Nizam attempted to manoeuvre himself towards independence, the internal \nsituation in the territory was deteriorating. The state had been crippled by communist \ninsurgents on the one hand, and forces loyal to the Nizam of Hyderabad on the other. \nTo a limited extent, Congress volunteers engaged in satyagraha had contributed to \nTaylor C. Sherman \n6 \nthe internal disorder by disrupting courts, filling jails, and engaging in sabotage with \nthe aim of convincing the Nizam to join the Indian Union. As stories of the conflict in \nthe state spread in India, and refugees fled into the surrounding Indian provinces, the \nGovernment of India concluded that the unrest threatened to undermine peace in the \nwhole of India.  \n \nWhen, in 1947, the authorities in Hyderabad refused to accede to either dominion, \nmany opposition parties in the state called for the Nizam to join the Indian Union. The \nCongress launched a satyagraha, and encouraged students to leave schools, and \nlawyers to boycott courts. More radical members of the Hyderabad State Congress \nplanned acts of sabotage, organised raids against government property and \ncommunications, and authorised their members to take action in \u2018self-defence\u2019, with \nweapons if necessary. According to an Indian government note in March 1948, 'the \neducational institutions function no more, the law courts are barren and the \ncommercial life is shattered.'17 As many as 21,000 congressmen were said to have \nbeen arrested.18 However, the Hyderabad State Congress Party was divided \norganisationally along regional lines, and ideologically between socialists and \nliberals; its impact on the internal situation in the state, therefore, was more limited \nthan that of the communists.19  \n \nThe fight between the communists and forces loyal to the Nizam, by contrast, was \ncharacterised in the spring of 1948 as \u2018a people's revolt on the one side and fascist \norgy and anarchy on the other\u2019.20 Its roots were in the insurgency begun in 1944-\n1945 in the Nalgonda and Warangal districts, known as the Telangana area, in the \neast of the territory. Forces loyal to the Nizam of Hyderabad sought to repress this \ncommunist movement. These forces comprised of police and military as well as local \nmembers of the Razakars. The Razakars, headed by Kasim Razvi, were a \nparamilitary organisation comprised of volunteers who were said to be as \nTaylor C. Sherman \n7 \nenthusiastic as they were undisciplined.21 Razvi and his volunteers were associated \nwith the Majlis-i-Ittehad-ul-Muslimein, a political party with considerable influence \nover the Nizam and dedicated to maintaining Muslim rule in Hyderabad.22 Both \ncommunists and forces loyal to the Nizam employed brutal measures to strike \nagainst their enemy and intimidate villagers into collaboration. According to a \npamphlet that the Government of India had drawn up for public consumption, \nbetween 15 August 1947 and 13 September 1948, the communists had murdered \n2000 people, attacked 22 police outposts, destroyed village records, manhandled \n141 village officials, seized 230 guns, eight revolvers and one rifle, looted or \ndestroyed paddy worth Rs70,000, robbed cash and jewellery worth Rs10,43,668, and \ndestroyed 20 customs outposts.23 While the primary fight up until early 1948 had \nbeen between the communists and the Nizam\u2019s forces, in May 1948, the Nizam and \nurban members of the communist party struck an improbable tactical alliance against \na common enemy, the \u2018bourgeois\u2019 Indian Union. According to the agreement, which \naimed to bolster the fight for the independence of Hyderabad, the Nizam amnestied \ncommunists from jails, cancelled outstanding arrest warrants and lifted the ban on \nthe party.  \n \nDuring the summer of 1948, the Razakars continued to seek out and eliminate the \nenemies of the regime.24 They targeted not only Hindus, but Muslims whose loyalty \nwas in doubt.25 As it became clear that negotiations with the Indian Union were \nstalemated, they also courted confrontation with Indian forces. Their raids against \ntrains and villages in Madras, the Central Provinces (CP) and Bombay raised panic in \nthese provinces. In July, Razakars killed six Indian Army troops in an ambush near \nthe Indian enclave of Nanaj. 26 Equally, there were allegations that Indian troops \ncrossed Hyderabad\u2019s borders as they gave chase to Razakars. The Government in \nDelhi concluded that the increasing influence and violence of these unruly volunteer \nparamilitaries proved that the Nizam had lost control over his own territory.  \nTaylor C. Sherman \n8 \n \nThese battles threatened to spill into Union territory in more than one way. First, \nrefugees fleeing the disorders escaped into Indian territory to form large camps in the \nprovinces of Madras and Bombay. Some estimates put the number of refugees at \n40,000 in CP alone.27 Secondly, though the fault lines in the conflict did not run \nneatly along religious lines, the perceived \u2018communal\u2019 nature of the fighting \nthreatened to revive Hindu-Muslim tensions in India.28  \n \nThe Nizam\u2019s government tended to privilege a few thousand Muslims, leaving an \nunderclass of poor Muslims. Nationalist Muslims in the State tended to oppose the \nNizam, while, as far away as Delhi, the Socialist Party enrolled Muslim volunteers to \nagitate against the Nizam.29 At the same time, the Depressed Classes Association \nand Depressed Classes Conference in Hyderabad had joined hands with the Nizam \nin June 1947 to fight against incorporation into the Indian Union, because they \nbelieved accession would entail domination by caste Hindus.30  \n \nThe structure of rule in the state, however, where a predominantly-Muslim \ngovernment and gentry held power over large numbers of disadvantaged, of whom \nthe majority were Hindus, appeared to divide the population along religious lines. And \nsome political parties took advantage of this. Since the war, the All-India Hindu \nMahasabha had used this government structure to gather support for their \norganisation. In 1941 they began to keep a record of all, \u2018tyrannous and political \ninjustices and unfairness on the Hindus in all Provinces and particularly under Muslim \nadministration and Muslim states.\u201931 Hyderabad was no exception.32 As the violence \nof the Nizam\u2019s forces increased in Hyderabad, Hindu nationalists called on Muslims \nthroughout India \u2018to give proof of their loyalty to the Indian Union,\u2018 by opposing the \nNizam\u2019s regime.33 Clearly, the subtleties and complexities of the Hyderabad situation \nwere being folded into all-India communal politics. The Government of India, \nTaylor C. Sherman \n9 \ntherefore, concluded that the unrest in Hyderabad threatened to destabilise \u2018the \ncommunal situation in the whole of India\u2019.34  \n \nIn the volatile international situation in South Asia in the year following independence, \nNehru had been reluctant to use force to bring Hyderabad into the Indian Union.35 \nThe Indian economy was suffering a crisis of inflation, accompanied by a panic in the \ngold market, which impelled the Government of India to re-impose controls on textiles \nand other essential commodities. In addition, the autumn of 1948 was a tense time \nfor the militaries on the subcontinent. Pakistan had admitted that its troops were \npresent in Kashmir, and Nehru was writing of being at war with its neighbour, albeit \nan undeclared one.36 India feared that any move against Hyderabad would prompt a \nmilitary response from Pakistan. Though Pakistan had no plans to protect Hyderabad \nwith arms, India did not know this.37 Moreover, the new government in India was \ntrying to calm tensions after the violence of partition, and struggling to provide for \nmillions of refugees. The situation in Hyderabad, they concluded, must be resolved \nbefore it adversely affected India\u2019s internal and international security.  \n \nOn 13 September 1948, therefore, the Government of India declared a state of \nemergency, and sent its troops into Hyderabad State. During the \u2018police action\u2019, the \nIndian Army entered Hyderabad with the objective of forcing the Nizam to re-install \nIndian troops in Secunderabad to allow them to restore order in the state. The Nizam \nsurrendered in four days, and the Government of India appointed Major-General J.N. \nChaudhuri as Military Governor. Delhi decided that the Nizam could retain his \nposition as Rajpramukh, though law-making and enforcement power rested with the \nMilitary Governor.  \n \nHindu-Muslim relations and the character of the new Hyderabad State \n \nTaylor C. Sherman \n10 \nOnce they had seized control of the territory, the new Military Governor, Major \nGeneral Chaudhuri, the Chief Civil Administrator, D.S. Bakhle, and the Government \nin Delhi had to ask themselves what character and composition they wished the new \nHyderabad state to have. This question involved a number of different elements. \nFirst, to what extent would those who took part in violence before and during the \npolice action be punished for their activities? Secondly, how far would the Muslim-\ndominated administration in the state be altered? Finally, what role would the \nCongress Party have in the new state? Given that each of these questions impacted \nHindu-Muslim relations, Nehru felt that the decisions which they made in Hyderabad \nwould be seen as the touchstone of the Indian government\u2019s minority policy.38  \n \nBefore the invasion of Hyderabad, Nehru\u2019s primary concern was to normalise Hindu-\nMuslim relations there and in the rest of the country. He wrote to Patel that, after the \nproblem of the Razakars, all other issues were \u2018relatively secondary\u2019.39 Before the \nfirst Indian troop set foot in Hyderabad, there was much uncertainty over whether the \npolice action would provoke an adverse reaction amongst Muslims in India. In the \nstate\u2019s surrounding provinces, therefore, provincial governments detained dozens of \nMuslims, including Members of the Legislative Assembly, for \u2018security reasons\u2019, on \nthe grounds that their sympathies with Hyderabad might spur them into inciting \nunrest.40 As troops marched into the state, many Muslims in India lent their support \nto the police action, however.41 Prominent Muslims in Delhi publicly welcomed the \nGovernment of India\u2019s choice to come to the aid of the \u2018innocent masses\u2019 threatened \nby the Razakars, and appealed for calm.42 In the event, there was no trouble in India \nduring the five days of the police action. Indeed, before reports emerged of the \nfighting within the state, Nehru ventured to declare that Hyderabad had 'suddenly \nopened out a new picture of communal peace and harmony.'43  \n \nTaylor C. Sherman \n11 \nQuickly, however, stories began to seep out of large-scale violence within the \nterritory in the immediate aftermath of the police action. It is unclear exactly what \nhappened between the people of Hyderabad, the members of the falling regime, and \nthe invading forces during and immediately after the police action, but it appears that \nthere was widespread bloodshed as the population took the opportunity to commit \nacts of violence against the Razakars and other Muslims. Two prominent nationalists, \nPandit Sunderlal and Qazi Abdulghaffar prepared a report on the situation after \nNehru appointed them to tour the state and assess the extent of the destruction, but \nthe original was suppressed and only scraps of it remain.44 They recorded that after \n13 September, there had been a widespread anti-Muslim purge, which had occurred \nprimarily in the Marathwada and Telangana areas. What evidence is available \nsuggests that Hindu residents as well as some members of the Army attacked \npersons and property in the weeks after the police action began.45 Conservative \nestimates suggest that 50,000 Muslims were killed.46 Others claim several hundred \nthousand died.47 Indian troops in some places remained aloof from these activities, in \nothers, they were implicated in them.48 Sunderlal and Abdulghaffar concluded that, \n\u2018In general the attitude of the military officers was good but the soldiers showed \nbigotry and hatred.\u201949 The invasion of Hyderabad had not heralded a new era of \ncommunal harmony in the territory. Instead, the main task of the new authorities in \nthe state was to cope with the aftermath of the turmoil. \n \nIn order to depose the existing regime and to contain the unrest, the Government of \nIndia\u2019s police and military authorities had detained Razakars, Hindu militants, \ncommunists and many others more loosely connected with the general upheaval. \nAccording to their own figures, the military and police detained over 13,000 Muslims, \nplus several hundred Arabs and Pathans, who were associated with the Razakars \nand the Nizam\u2019s irregular forces. Another several thousand Hindus were jailed after \nhaving been implicated in the post-police action reprisals against Muslims. Many \nTaylor C. Sherman \n12 \ncommunists were also detained. But it is clear that, with their limited knowledge of \nthe local situation, the invading forces simply jailed thousands of suspects without \nreal knowledge of their activities. The police and military were captive to local \ninformants, who took advantage of the situation to have their political enemies \nimprisoned.50 Indeed, many of the difficulties which the colonial regime had faced \nwhen confronting large-scale communal unrest also affected the early postcolonial \ngovernment: the police and military were disposed to make mass arrests in order to \nrestore order, and to think about prosecution only after the event. But court cases \noften simply provided another arena for the conflict, and the government came under \npolitical pressure to release those detained.51 \n \nHaving imprisoned an estimated 17,550 people as they entered the territory, the \nGovernment of India was left with the questions of what to do with all the prisoners \nrounded up in the upheaval, and how to relieve the problem of over-crowded jails.52 \nIn Hyderabad, the Government of India inherited a criminal justice system which had \nbeen paralysed by the conflict, and could not process any significant number of \ncases. This meant that, just as in British India, politics came to determine who was \nsubjected to formal punishment, and who escaped. Of course, many of the political \naims of the Nehru government were different from those of the British: they were \nconcerned not to spend money on expensive legal proceedings which could \notherwise be used for development projects; and they were sensitive to the \nimportance of political parties in a democratic age. For their part, many members of \nthe public remained constant in their insistence that, when the government punished \nparticipants in communal violence, this only worsened relations between those \ncommunities who were perceived to be at loggerheads with one another.53 For these \nreasons, though thousands were originally detained, only a few exemplary persons \nremained in jail by 1953.  \n \nTaylor C. Sherman \n13 \nGiven the volume of cases, the military regime decided to prosecute only those \u2018who \nindulged in the worst kind of atrocities\u2019.54 In the six months following the Nizam\u2019s \ndefeat, therefore, the government released over 11,000 Muslims without trial \nbecause no incriminating evidence against them existed. They also deported some \n2000 Arabs back to Aden and a similar number of Pathans to \u2018other parts of India\u2019.55 \nMajor-General Chaudhuri and his administration planned to prosecute the remainder \nof those detained. Accordingly, shortly after the proclamation of the State of \nEmergency, the Government of India propounded a Special Courts Order to \ndispense with the large numbers of persons in jail. In a word, the order was designed \nto process cases speedily. To this end, it relaxed the standards of written evidence \nby requiring only summaries of the evidence rather than full accounts; it made it \nimpossible for an accused to deliberately delay proceedings, e.g. by hunger striking; \nand, at first, it provided for no right to appeal to higher courts. This latter provision \nwas amended in October 1949, to allow appeals to the High Court for major offences. \nThere was no mention either way as to access to a lawyer, and it appears that while \nsome of the accused obtained counsel, others declined or were denied access to \none.56 The ordinance strongly resembled those which had been passed by the \ncolonial government during the twentieth century. For example, it incorporated the \nlessons which the British had learnt by making it impossible for a defendant to delay \na case by hunger striking.57  \n \nIn reality, the Special Tribunals were anything but speedy. In each of the courts sat a \nthree-member panel, all of whom had to be present for a case to proceed; when one \nmember was sick or on leave, the tribunal did not meet. Further, English was the \nworking language of the tribunals, but there were few advocates who were able to \nconduct a prosecution in English.58 As the trials made halting progress, thousands \nlanguished in jails waiting for the police to finish investigating their cases or for the \ncourts to begin their trials.59  \nTaylor C. Sherman \n14 \n \nBy April 1949, appeals for an amnesty were gaining volume. Thirteen Urdu \nnewspapers jointly asked the government to free Muslims who had been imprisoned \n\u2018on mere suspicion\u2019 and had yet to stand trial. The editors suggested that these men \nhad suffered in jail long enough, and that their continued detention would serve no \ngood purpose. To release them would help create a \u2018harmonious atmosphere\u2019 in the \nstate, and it would foster the minority community\u2019s confidence in the government.60 \nSimilarly, Swami Ramandanda Tirtha, leader of the Congress Party in the state, \nagreed that the institution of cases for events which had occurred nine months before \nwas \u2018causing great discontent\u2019.61  \n \nThe constraints of governance in a democratic state had an impact in three rather \ncontradictory ways on the decisions which the government made about these \nprisoners. First, as these men had been detained for several months without trial, the \nInternational Committee for the Red Cross was pressing Nehru to see that those \ndetained were either prosecuted or released.62 Nehru had long since realised that the \neyes of the world were on Hyderabad and wished to prove that the new Indian \nGovernment could be balanced in its approach to both Hindus and Muslims.63 \nSecondly, it was the widely held opinion amongst the new rulers of the state that the \ncommunist and \u2018communalist\u2019 parties in the state remained popular because the \nstate Congress Party was weak. Chaudhuri, therefore, hoped that the release of \nprisoners would \u2018rehabilitate the prestige of the Hyderabad State Congress\u2019 Party in \nthe eyes of the public in Hyderabad, and improve relations between the state and \nnational sections of the party.64 Even so, there could be no general amnesty because \nthe Military Governor still wished to prosecute prominent Razakars such as Kasim \nRazvi.65  \n \nTaylor C. Sherman \n15 \nWhen the government of Hyderabad, in consultation with the centre, weighed these \narguments, they knew that any policy adopted could not be seen to favour either \nHindus or Muslims. The new government convinced itself that equal blame did attach \nto each community. In Major-General Chaudhuri\u2019s words, \u2018in political physics, \nRazakar action and Hindu reaction have been almost equal and opposite\u2019.66 Thus, \nwhen it was decided to free all Hindus and to institute a programme for the review of \nMuslim cases with an aim to gradually letting many out of jail, the government \npreferred that the policy be given no publicity.67 Releases were staggered and former \nprisoners made to report periodically to the police.68  \n \nBecause prosecutions of either Hindus or Muslims in cases of \u2018communal\u2019 violence \ntended to elicit allegations of bias, any cases which were brought to court had to be \ndesigned to minimise ethnic tensions. Thus, Kasim Razvi and four of his associates \nwere prosecuted for the alleged murder of a fellow Muslim, Shoebullah Khan. The \nvictim, a nationalist journalist who had opposed the Razakars, was killed on 22 \nAugust 1948. His murder attracted public interest, though only after the police action \nhad begun. The Bombay Chronicle described the journalist as \u2018a brave young man\u2019 \nfor refusing to bow to the will of the Ittehad-ul-Muslimein. The paper went on to \ndeclare Shoebullah \u2018a martyr in the cause of the people.\u201969 Though a Special Tribunal \nfound Razvi and his cohorts guilty, they were acquitted in the High Court. The same \nmen stood accused in the Bibinaga Dacoity Case, which ran simultaneously with the \nShoebullah Khan case. In the former, it was alleged that, when passing through \nBibinaga station in a train, the accused had shouted 'Shah-e-Osman zindabad', but \nthe people in the station had replied with the nationalist slogan \u2018Mahatma Gandhi ki \njai\u2019. The accused then disembarked, and proceeded to burn down a house, and beat \nand rob those in the vicinity of the station.70 In this case, the High Court upheld the \nSpecial Tribunal\u2019s guilty verdict, and the men were sentenced to imprisonment. It was \nbelieved that if this type of case were chosen then the prosecutions would be more \nTaylor C. Sherman \n16 \nlikely to inspire in the public feelings of pure abhorrence or deep nationalism, rather \nthan enmity between Hindus and Muslims.  \n  \nAs news of the convictions of Razvi and his men reached the public, prominent \npoliticians again pressed Nehru to show generosity to the Muslims of Hyderabad.71 \nThe Prime Minister was sympathetic. Hyderabadi Muslims, he wrote to Patel, \nexemplified a unique \u2018and rather attractive culture\u2019, and were \u2018very much above the \naverage\u2019.72 In essence, Nehru argued that Muslim prisoners in Hyderabad were not \ncriminal types, and therefore did not merit punishment. Instead, their behaviour in the \nsummer and autumn of 1948 was analogous to the \u2018madness\u2019 that seized \u2018decent \npeople\u2019 in the country during partition. Many of those guilty of partition violence \nremained free in India and lived \u2018as respected citizens.\u201973 By this logic, if the crimes of \npartition could be buried, so could those of Hyderabad\u2019s accession. Nehru also \nwarned that if a gesture of \u2018friendliness\u2019 were not offered \u2018to those who are down and \nout and full of fear\u2019 these disenfranchised Muslims could join forces with the \ncommunists. Finally, the Prime Minister argued, in a developing state the money \nspent on prosecution could have \u2018brought rich results if spent on constructive \nactivities in Hyderabad.\u201974 \n \nWhen Nehru first voiced these arguments, Patel demurred. He was convinced that \nthe promise of penal action against criminals had helped restore law and order, and \nthat if that promise were not fulfilled, it would signal the government\u2019s partiality for \nMuslims and would endanger the peace in the state.75 By the time the cases of \nKasim Razvi and of the ex-ministers of the Nizam\u2019s regime had wound their way \nthrough the judicial system, Patel had passed away and elections were about to be \nheld under a much improved political atmosphere in the state. In January 1952, all \nex-Ministers were released; only Kasim Razvi and a few members of the Nizam\u2019s \nregime who had been involved in the most notorious cases remained in prison.76   \nTaylor C. Sherman \n17 \n \nIn the end, only a handful of symbolic Razakars were punished with formal \nimprisonment. Just as its colonial predecessor had been, the Indian government \nfaced administrative constraints which precluded the use of the ordinary judicial \nsystem to dispose of every case arising out of large scale violence. The police and \nmilitary, lacking real intelligence or familiarity with the territory, jailed thousands \nwithout obvious cause, and without labouring to find one. Courts, even special \ntribunals, were unable to work through the cases at a reasonable speed. Pleas for \namnesty inevitably arose in circumstances in which the members of the public \nbelieved that people were being detained unfairly for protracted periods. Political \nconsiderations, therefore, determined the futures of those who found themselves in \njail.  \n \nIntimately tied to these issues was the question of the Hindu-Muslim balance in the \nservices. The well-known rivalry between Patel and Nehru was crucial in this respect, \nas Patel often ran the States Ministry without as much consultation with Nehru\u2019s \nCabinet as the Prime Minister would have preferred.77 Before the invasion, Nehru \nhad presided over a meeting in which it was decided that, in order to be generous to \nthe Nizam and to create a positive impression on the other princely states, the \nmilitary regime ought to change as little as possible in Hyderabad. Dramatic \nadministrative and policy changes in the territory were to wait for a democratically-\nelected government.78 At other levels of administration, however, divergent ideas \ntook hold. The new authorities in Hyderabad attempted to adjust the ethnic balance \nin the executive, police and administrative services, where Muslims predominated. \nTo this end, they dismissed over a hundred officers, from the Chief Secretary to low-\nlevel police personnel. 79 They also detained many of those local officers who were \nsuspected of participating in the violence which accompanied the police action. In \naddition, they attempted to reduce the number of Muslims working in the civil service \nTaylor C. Sherman \n18 \nor sitting as judges through forced retirement, or transfer from the state. They \nadopted a policy of not hiring new Muslims in the services. The civilian administration \nunder Vellodi continued this policy.80 And the government introduced in June 1950 \nunder a scheme of diarchy had similar ideas.81  \n \nTo replace those dismissed, they drafted in junior officers from Bombay, CP and \nMadras. This created greater difficulties, however, as many of the new officers were \nnot only inexperienced, but were also unable to speak the languages of the people \nunder their jurisdiction, and were unfamiliar with local conditions.82 This left the \nadministration generally, and the criminal justice system in particular, unable to \nfunction efficiently or effectively. The Prime Minister objected to these schemes on \nthe grounds that they were both inspired by \u2018communal\u2019 chauvinism and impractical \nbecause they brought in incompetent outsiders.83 Nehru, along with many \nHyderabadis, called for qualified Hyderabad residents to fill vacant posts. However, \nthe people taking the reigns of power in Hyderabad were able to circumvent these \norders by falsifying residency documents.84 Thus, the answers which were found to \nthe question of the ethnic composition of the services were neither similar, nor co-\nordinated. It is clear that the new Indian government in Delhi, like its British \npredecessor, had to contend with competing visions of the state. These visions were \nnot identical to those present before 1947, but they were a mark of the continued \ninability of the centre to elicit discipline and obedience from the individuals it \nemployed. \n \nThe Congress party in Hyderabad \n \nThe final question facing the new authorities in Hyderabad was what the role of the \nCongress Party in the state ought to be. Initially, the answer seemed relatively \nstraightforward to the government in Delhi. Congressmen at the head of the \nTaylor C. Sherman \n19 \nGovernment of India wished the Hyderabad State Congress Party to guide the future \nof the state. To some extent this decision can be explained by the supposed \nideological affinity between the local and the national party. Technically, the \nHyderabad State Congress had not been part of the all-India party because \naffiliations with outside organisations had been banned under the Nizam. \nHyderabad\u2019s Swami Ramananda Tirtha, however, had participated in the non-\ncooperation movement in Sholapur, and later made frequent visits to Gandhi. Tirtha \noften consulted him on matters of policy, though the two did not always agree.85 In \naddition, the all-India party had contributed to the Congress satyagraha in the state in \n1938.86 Moreover, the Hyderabad State Congress was also one of the few political \norganisations which was not confined to a single linguistic group, and which \nattempted to span the entire state. It would be easier to work with a single \norganisation rather than with the several linguistic parties.  \n \nAt the time, however, the Hyderabad State Congress had been in existence for little \nmore than a decade, and had operated as no more than a token institution before \n1946. It suffered from organisational shallowness and internal divisions.87 If it were to \ntake power successfully, the Hyderabad State Congress Party would need all the \nhelp it could get from the national party. To this end, when they took over the \ngovernance of the state, the Indian authorities ordered the release of all \nCongressmen who had landed in Hyderabad\u2019s jails during their campaign of \nsatyagraha and sabotage before the police action. Before the release, there was \nsome debate as to whether those who had committed crimes of violence should be \nfreed. In the event, Congressmen accused of violent crimes were let out, while \ncommunists were kept in jail, whether their crimes involved violence or not.88 Under \nthese orders, the Government of India released 1222 out of 1736 detenus, and 7893 \nout of 9218 political prisoners.89  \n \nTaylor C. Sherman \n20 \nThe situation was far more fluid than had been anticipated, however. As the military \nand police attempted to restore order by arranging prosecutions against those who \nhad partaken in the violence, many Congressmen ended up back in jail. The Military \nGovernor reported that one faction in the party, \u2018has given information against the \nmembers of the other groups for having been concerned in the commission of \natrocities after police action.'90 It became clear that the fissures within the Hyderabad \nState Congress would not be easy to repair. Nehru met with Congressmen in the \nstate to persuade them to bury their differences in the interests of their country.91 \nV.P. Menon and Sardar Patel, repeatedly pressed the divergent blocs in the party to \nadopt a \u2018united approach\u2019, but their \u2018bickering\u2019 and \u2018mud flinging\u2019 continued \nunabated.92 Thus, though the Government of India originally had intended to \nestablish a constituent assembly in Hyderabad, and to transfer power to a civilian \ngovernment composed of Hyderabadis, within a few months of the police action, both \nobjectives were soon shelved. The government in Delhi refused to hand power to \ndemocratically-elected representatives when the Hyderabad State Congress \nremained in ideological and organisational disarray.93 It therefore orchestrated a \nmore gradual transfer of power, and did not sanction state-wide elections until 1952.  \n \nIf the state comprises not only policy, but institutions and individuals, it is difficult to \ndraw a clear and simple picture of the Indian state during the first months after the \npolice action because these three levels seem to be pulling in different directions. \nPolicy coming from the Government of India level was clearly concerned to appear \neven-handed in its punishment of participants in the violence which surrounded the \ndeposal of the Nizam\u2019s regime. Nehru, at least, was also keen to avoid making \ndrastic changes to state institutions. But as they took control of Hyderabad, the new \nIndian government found itself with poor institutions and independently-minded local \nofficers. As a result, the composition of the administration in Hyderabad was changed \nsignificantly, and Muslims tended to be disenfranchised during this period. The \nTaylor C. Sherman \n21 \nnature of politics in a democratic state also affected policy, for the centre\u2019s decisions \nwere designed to improve the stature of the Congress party, and to appeal to certain \nmembers of the electorate. But there were others who were not so easily pleased, \nand it is to the communists that we now turn.  \n \nThe communist insurgency and the making of the new state \n \nWhen they arrived in Hyderabad, the Indian military found that the communists had \ndone great damage to the structures of government in the Telangana region, but that \nthey had also introduced reforms on an impressive scale. The government, therefore, \nboth fought the communists, and learned from them. Or rather, they fought them first, \nand then they learned from them. Their various encounters with the communists \naffected the future of India as a whole in many ways. This section will highlight two. \nFirst, some of the oppressive measures used against the movement came to be \nincorporated into the new nation\u2019s constitution. Secondly, the development work of \nthe communists encouraged the government to adopt its own programme of uplift for \nthe peasantry. \n \nWhile the main justification the Government of India used as they entered Hyderabad \nwas to end the \u2018communal\u2019 violence, they soon found that the problems in the state \nwere intimately related to the communist uprising which was flourishing in the \nTelangana region of the state, for the violent struggle against the Nizam was centred \nin Telangana and led by communists. The communists drew adherents from a \nnumber of fronts. Amongst the poor peasantry and landless labourers, there was \ngreat resentment against the jagirdari system of landholding which governed 43 per \ncent of land in the state. This system was infamous for the high rate of forced labour \nextracted from peasants who held little land, were given paltry access to water and \nmanure, and were subjected to high rates by (often absentee) landlords. Moreover, \nTaylor C. Sherman \n22 \nduring the Second World War, the burden of a compulsory levy fell heavily on the \npeasants who were experiencing similar agrarian troubles to those which plagued the \nrest of India. Rural areas also lacked facilities for medical care and education. These \nfactors combined with a system in which customary class distinctions were often \nreinforced with brutal violence to leave a large number of peasants alienated from \nthose who governed them.94 In addition, urban communists and wealthier peasants \nhad initially fought their own battles under the communist banner, but by 1948, the \ncoalition between poor and middling peasants had fallen apart.95 \n \nIn rural areas, the communist cause, led by Ravi Narayan Reddi and organised \nunder the aegis of the Andhra Mahasabha, sought to alleviate the grievances of the \npoor peasants in the Telangana area.96 Though at the outset, they only targeted \nzamindars and deshmukhs, the police and military were pulled into the conflict at the \nrequest of local magnates, and by December 1945, the communists had launched a \nfull-scale agitation against the state. Initially, they assaulted the prestige of \ngovernment officials, especially the police. They progressed to boycotting local \nrevenue collectors and judicial officials, and then to establishing their own \npanchayats and courts. Between July and November 1946, encounters between the \ncommunists and the Nizam\u2019s forces grew increasingly violent, and in the last two \nmonths of that year, the Nizam\u2019s police and military, with the occasional aid of local \nRazakars, undertook coordinated action against the communists. The Nizam\u2019s \nforces\u2019 tactics were varied. They cordoned off villages and captured suspected \ncommunists en masse, shot into crowds, burnt villages and engaged in widespread \nloot in a manner than that was described by one Congressman as \u2018absolutely \nindiscriminate and organised.\u201997 Habeeb Mohammed, the subedar of Warangal, was \nlater tried for crimes which included murder, and the burning of two hundred houses \nin the village of Gurtur. The taluqdar of Nalgonda, Moazzam Hussain, was said to \nhave ordered the death of twenty \u2018innocent Hindus\u2019 after a group of several hundred \nTaylor C. Sherman \n23 \ncommunists had attacked and killed several dozen Razakars.98 The communists \nresponded with \u2018punishment\u2019 against government officials and suspected \ncollaborators. Their measures were said to be more targeted but equally brutal.99 \nAccounts of the action taken by both sides were documented by the Government of \nIndia, 100 by politicians such as Sarojini Naidu\u2019s daughter, Padmaja Naidu,101 and \nthey also appeared in the press.102 \n \nWhen it became clear that the communists had not laid down their arms when the \nIndian Army arrived, the Military Governor adopted a policy of rooting out \ncommunists wherever they were found. Rhetoric was found to match. Nehru \ninstructed Chaudhuri that the fighters in Telangana should not be referred to as \ncommunists, but as terrorists. The Prime Minister wrote, \u2018too much talk of \ncommunists confuses the issue because communists in other countries function \ndifferently.\u2019103 He made a distinction between communists in the Soviet Union and \nIndonesia who opposed imperialism, and those fighting the free government of \nindependent India. To add factual support to this discourse, the Government of \nHyderabad drew up a pamphlet entitled \u2018Communist terrorism in Hyderabad\u2019. The \npamphlet\u2019s message was simple:  \nthe Communist hooligans of Hyderabad have carried forward their \ncampaign of crime to an extent that assures it a prominent place in \nany anthology of destruction.104 \nGovernment forces, it was implied, had the right to use force to restore order, and to \nremove these outlaws from the territory. The means adopted to dislodge the \ncommunists were also heavy-handed. By December 1949, the police and military \nhad jailed over 6000 persons without trial, and yet the ranks of communists seemed \nto be growing.105 \n \nTaylor C. Sherman \n24 \nFundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution and the situation in Hyderabad  \n \nThough these detentions did not have much effect on the communist movement, they \ndid have a profound impact on the shape of the Indian Constitution, which was \nfinalised during this crucial period in the country\u2019s history. As the document was \nbeing drawn up by the Constituent Assembly, the sub-committee on Fundamental \nRights was given the task of articulating the legal, political and social rights of the \nnew citizens of the Republic of India.106 B.R. Ambedkar drew up a set of rules for \narrest and detention which would suit India\u2019s unique needs. After many revisions, the \nsubstance of Ambedkar\u2019s final, multi-part article provided for very little protection \nagainst long-term detention without trial. It laid down rights for those arrested or \ndetained, but then stated that these rights did not apply to those held under \npreventive detention laws which might be passed by the legislatures.107 Ambedkar \njustified the text on two grounds. First, India was in great turmoil: refugees, economic \ncrisis, uncertainty over princely states and the rise of communism throughout the \ncountry justified the use of preventive detention. Secondly, it was not a \u2018practical \npossibility\u2019 to expect the current executive, judicial and administrative system to \nprocess and review large numbers of detentions, given the current political situation \nin the country.108 The infrastructure they had inherited was inadequate for the work at \nhand. If the constitution were to endow citizens with the right to have their cases \nreviewed in less than three months, as critics of the clause had suggested, then \nthousands would have to be released because courts and review boards would fail to \nmeet the deadline.  \n \nIt would be easy to conclude that these measures signalled the willingness of the \nGovernment of India\u2019s new leadership to anchor their power in the country by any \nmeans necessary. However, the articles adopted in the constitution must be seen in \nthe context of the recent past in India. That most Congressmen had been detained \nTaylor C. Sherman \n25 \nwithout trial for several years during the recent war affected the way that detention \nwas viewed in the country. Imprisonment without trial was seen as a measure \nnecessary in the face of grave danger. But the inveterate legalism of the leadership \nof the nationalist movement encouraged them to try to articulate in law the precise \nterms on which that power could be exercised. And yet, with knowledge of the \nweakness of the institutions which they had inherited, the constitution makers were \nunwilling to be tied down. The clause was the uneasy result of a compromise \nbetween legalism and pragmatism.   \n \nCivilian administration and the victory of the generous \n \nJust as the constitution came into force, the political situation in Hyderabad began to \ntake a new direction. In December 1949, the Military Governor\u2019s administration \nended, and M.K. Vellodi replaced Major-General Chaudhuri at the head of the new \ncivilian administration in Hyderabad. Vellodi toured the Telangana districts and found \nthat the authorities stationed in the area had not dealt with the communist cause \u2018with \nany understanding\u2019. He testified that, 'the villagers who had been alternately beaten \nup by the Military and the Police and the communists had a haunted look.\u2019109 This \nsection examines how the civil administration won the war with a combination of \nmore responsive policing, and more aggressive programmes of development.  \n \nThough the communists were branded \u2018terrorists\u2019 in public, the government quietly \nlearned lessons from them. It was clear that the communists had earned the support \nof the people because they had tapped into grievances which the Indian government \nin the state had not begun to address. Assessing the achievements of the \ncommunists in the field of social and economic uplift, the Intelligence Bureau\u2019s \nDeputy Director deemed them \u2018positive and in some cases great.\u2019110 The communists \nhad redistributed land and livestock, reduced rates, ended forced labour and \nTaylor C. Sherman \n26 \nincreased wages by one hundred percent. They inoculated the population and built \npublic latrines; they encouraged women\u2019s organisations, discouraged sectarian \nsentiment and sought to abolish untouchability. \u2018Thus\u2019, concluded the Deputy \nDirector, \u2018the Communist regime was one of relief and uplift to the isolated villager \nand improved his self-respect.'111 \n \nMembers of the government in India were not ignorant of the significant influence of \nagrarian uplift on the political situation. Indeed, Nehru encouraged the Ministry of \nStates to view the problems of the peasantry in Hyderabad in the context of the \u2018great \nagrarian revolution \u2026taking place over these vast areas of Asia\u2019.112 In light of the \ncommunist uprisings in Burma, Malaya and Indonesia in 1948, it was obvious to the \nmore discerning members of India\u2019s governing class that the communist movement \nappealed to those in Telangana who suffered under conditions of socio-economic \ndistress.113 Indeed, soon after the police action, Swami Ramananda Tirtha and his \ngroup in the State Congress cautioned Nehru that the use of force against \ncommunists would have to be supplemented with agrarian reforms in order to strike \nat the \u2018root cause\u2019 of the movement.114 \n \nAs the state\u2019s first Chief Minister, Vellodi initiated a number of more nuanced military \nmeasures designed to disrupt the communist movement. He replaced the Brigadier \nin charge of the Telangana area, who spoke no Telugu, with Captain Nanjappa of the \nIndian Civil Service, who acted as Special Commissioner in the region.115 Review \ncommittees were constituted to consider the cases of prisoners who were elderly, \ninfirm, or were no threat to security.116 Within a year over 5000 detenus were \nfreed.117 Nanjappa substituted the sweeping and heavy-handed operations of the \nmilitary with small police parties which worked on the basis of intelligence.118 Home \nguards and village patrols were organised to assist the police.119 In the beginning of \n1951, Nanjappa gave secret instructions to start a \u2018whispering campaign\u2019 to let it be \nTaylor C. Sherman \n27 \nknown that those who laid down their arms voluntarily would have their cases \n\u2018favourably considered.\u2019120  \n \nThe authorities also began to build or repair infrastructure from roads and wells to \ndispensaries and schools. They passed a Tenancy Act, which was designed to \nimprove the rights of tenants by capping landholdings, opening the market to \ncultivators, and protecting tenants from ejection.121 Although land reforms were not \nimplemented in a uniform manner, and they did not go far enough in many areas, the \nAct went some way to recognising peasant grievances.122 A Tribal Reclamation \nScheme was introduced in Warangal, under which two teams of Social Service \nOfficers were constituted to \u2018redress grievances and create contentment\u2019 amongst \nthe inhabitants of the area.123 To this end, they travelled through rural areas, and \ntried to settle any outstanding disputes, and alleviate all major difficulties in the lives \nof the villagers. These officers aimed to see that vacant government land was \nallotted, tenants\u2019 rights confirmed, disputes with absentee landlords settled, land \ntaken by moneylenders restored and debts reconciled. Having been allotted a lump \nsum of two lakhs, and an annual budget of 1.38 lakhs, they arranged for the supply of \nessential commodities such as cloth, kerosene and iron at subsidised prices.124 \nPolice and Revenue officials who visited tribal people distributed medicines, sold \ncheap cloth, and handed out free dhotis, sarees, soap, slates and books. As a result, \nnoted the Deputy Central Intelligence officer with a hint of surprise, \u2018their cooperation \nwith the forces of law and order in this division is most spontaneous.\u2019125 They were \neven helping to capture communists.126 \n \nThere are indications in the available documents, however, that these schemes were \nnot without elements of coercion. The hill tribes in the area, the Koyas, Chenchus \nand Lambadas, were said to have had connections with the communists, who used \nthem as couriers, and their settlements as hide-outs.127 In order to disrupt the \nTaylor C. Sherman \n28 \nassociation between the two, the tribes \u2018were uprooted from their villages inside the \nforests and made to live nearer to human habitation.\u2019128 By February 1951, 7000 out \nof 30,000 Koyas in the Warangal area had been settled in villages under this \nscheme.129 It was widely reported that, because re-located tribes people lacked basic \nfacilities such as drinking water, they and their livestock fell victim to hunger and \ndisease.130    \n \nMeasures for the uplift or simple relocation of tribesmen and of the peasantry, \nwhether forced or voluntary, seemed to have drawn many away from communist \ninfluence. As a result, the communists had difficulty securing food, water and \nammunition from the population.131 Moreover, the Communist Party of India (CPI) \nwas divided over whether to continue the violent struggle in Telangana, or to \nparticipate in the general elections due the following year.132 In Hyderabad, the \nmovement split along the same lines. Raj Bahadur Goud, and Maqdoom Mohiuddin, \nmembers of the City Communist Party, as well as Ravi Narayan Reddi, a prominent \nleader of the Andhra Mahasabha came out of hiding to disassociate themselves from \nthe violent movement. They were promptly arrested.133 After seeking guidance from \nMoscow and Beijing, the CPI and the Andhra Mahasabha called off the armed \nstruggle in the state in mid-October 1951.134 Top-ranking communists visited the \nstate to support the call for a turn to electioneering. Though the change in policy did \nnot satisfy all members of the movement, it brought about a formal end to the \nTelangana struggle.135 In 1952, the various parties of the left in the state united to \nform the People\u2019s Democratic Front to contest the forthcoming general elections.  \n \nThe fight against the communists can be divided into two phases, the first  executed \nby the military, the next orchestrated by the civilian administration. The military phase \nof the campaign bore remarkable resemblance to military action during the British \nperiod. Hampered by a dearth of intelligence, and blinkered by the over-riding \nTaylor C. Sherman \n29 \nimperative to restore order, their over-bearing acts of oppression and indiscriminate \npunishments produced either bitter quiescence or unending antagonism in the \nsubject population. The Indian government in Hyderabad came into its own when \nVellodi took power at the head of a civilian administration. Vellodi and Nanjappa \n\u2018discovered\u2019 that if they could slake the population\u2019s thirst for basic goods, the \ngovernment could win their loyalty as well. And, marking a crucial departure from the \nBritish period, they found the funds necessary to achieve this end.  \n \nThis can be seen as part of a larger, global shift both in the nature of governance \nmore generally and in counter-insurgency tactics in particular. After the second world \nwar, the nature of citizenship changed as the responsibility of the state for the social \nand economic welfare of its population was greatly expanded. At around the same \ntime, the British, too, began combating the communist insurgency in Malaya with \nmeasures designed to ameliorate the economic conditions in the countryside.136 The \nleadership of the new Indian nation quickly grasped the notion that if they were to \nearn and retain the loyalty of the people of India, they would have to fulfil the \npromises of the nationalist movement and provide uplift for the common people. If \nthey failed in this task, they risked losing the allegiance of villagers, peasantry and \nlabourers to communists who promised the prosperity that the Congress party could \nnot deliver. \n \nThe end of Hyderabad \n \nHyderabad\u2019s fate, in the final account, was intimately connected with that of South \nIndia as a whole. Since independence, significant sections of the population had \nurged the Government of India to re-divide the provinces in India along linguistic \nlines. Hyderabad, situated in the centre of South India, and populated by four distinct \nlinguistic groups, was elemental to this vision of India. Indeed, as the existence of \nTaylor C. Sherman \n30 \nHyderabad kept these groups from being unified with their linguistic brethren, it was \nseen by some as the \u2018centre of gravity of the British Empire in India.\u2019 137 Socialists in \nthe new nation detested the feudal conditions extant in the state, and believed that \nthe system could only be abolished by dismembering every element of the Nizam\u2019s \nregime.138 The disintegration of Hyderabad, in these views, was essential in order to \nestablish real swaraj in India. \n \nThough he cautioned against repeating the sins of partition, Nehru conceded that, in \nprinciple, if there was \u2018strong and widespread\u2019 support for the re-drawing of India\u2019s \ninternal borders, then \u2018a democratic government must ultimately submit to it.\u2019139 In \nHyderabad, politics had long moved along linguistic lines, and the major players, \nincluding the Andhra Mahasabha, and the faction of the Congress Party led by \nSwami Ramananda Tirtha, favoured the break-up of the state.140 The People's \nDemocratic Front, the socialists and the Peasants and Workers Party participated in \nthe campaign for the disintegration of the state as well.141 In addition, the \nincorporation of Hyderabad into the Indian Union had emphasised the importance of \nlocal officers who spoke the local language of the population. This realization, \ncombined with the agitation for linguistic states, tipped the balance against the \ncontinued existence of Hyderabad. In 1953, the state of Andhra Pradesh was carved \nout of Madras. In 1956, the Telugu-speaking regions of Hyderabad, including \nTelangana, were joined with the new province. And Hyderabad\u2019s Marathi speakers \nwere eventually amalgamated into the new state of Maharashtra, and its Kannada \nspeakers into Karnataka.  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of the experience of Hyderabad, how can one characterise the state in \nindependent India? Though this article only concerns Hyderabad, the police military \nTaylor C. Sherman \n31 \nand bureaucracy which form the basis of this analysis were drafted into the state \nfrom outside, and, though one must be cautious, it is possible to draw conclusions \nwhich range beyond the borders of the former princely state. It is clear that, while \nthere were some continuities, there were also sharp differences between the colonial \nand postcolonial state. When the members of the new government took over the \ninstitutions left behind by the British, they inherited many of the constraints of the \ncolonial system. Courts were easily overwhelmed by unrest; prisons continued to be \nused as holding cells, rather than as disciplinary institutions; the police and the \nmilitary were often clumsy and heavy handed, especially in the first phase of the \noccupation; and local officers could not always be relied upon to implement the \ncentre\u2019s policies as directed. The colonial apparatus simply did not provide the \nstability and coherence which many scholars have presumed. \n \nThe new Government of India was able to integrate Hyderabad into the Indian Union \nbecause it was innovative. These innovations were inspired as much by pragmatism \nas by democratic concerns and ideological change. Because the Congress Party was \nconcerned to assert its influence over the voting population, members of the \ngovernment tended to formulate policies to serve this end. Intimately connected with \nthe democratic imperative was the new socialist ethos which influenced government \npolicy. Whether inspired by the communists of Telangana, contemporary practices of \ncounter-insurgency, or Nehruvian socialism, the postcolonial state was more directed \ntowards the uplift of Indian villagers. It quickly learned that development programmes \ncould be more effective than coercion in certain circumstances.  \n \nAbove all, the rulers of independent India were remarkably flexible, particularly during \nthe first few years after 1947. In Delhi and in Hyderabad members of government \nwere not, as a whole, intractably loyal to any single idea. They were willing to adapt \ntheir policies to changing facts on the ground. This means that they did not fight all \nTaylor C. Sherman \n32 \ntheir battles in the same way: in Hyderabad development was an important element \nin their fight against communists; in other places, other tactics predominated. In \nHyderabad, new styles of governance had to be developed precisely because \npostcolonial India did not possess the institutional framework necessary to fight \ncommunists using the oppressive powers of the colonial police, military and \nbureaucracy. If later governments were able to secure their tenure by using these \ninstitutions, they did so only after significant change. Indeed, the military changed \nstructurally and doctrinally after 1947.142 And the ranks of the police and bureaucracy \nexpanded remarkably.143 Historians must now turn our attention to these changes, \nand we must begin to view the Nehruvian era as a time of uncertainty, dynamism and \neven contest within the new Indian state. \nTaylor C.
