We thank the conference participants\nand an anonymous referee for useful comments. This paper is partly based on a 2003 working paper version\nof our \u0093friendly boards\u0094paper. It only includes material that did not appear in the published version (Adams\nand Ferreira, 2007).\nElectronic copy available at: http:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=1409833\n1 Introduction\nAll recent proposals for governance reform call for a more active monitoring role of boards\nthrough increased independence. As evidence that boards have failed to do their work prop-\nerly, many point to the corporate and accounting scandals at Enron, Tyco and Worldcom.\nFor example, in its report on Enron\u0092s collapse, the US Senate argued that by not question-\ning management about the complicated \u0085nancial transactions Enron was engaging in, the\nboard had failed in its \u0085duciary duties to shareholders (U.S. House, 2002). Others question\nhow boards award executive compensation. Especially in the US, concerns that CEO pay\nis too high to be compatible with shareholder value maximization are widespread (e.g. Be-\nbchuk and Fried, 2003). Additional concerns are the size of the pay-performance relation\n(e.g. Jensen and Murphy, 1990; Hall and Liebman, 1998), contractual puzzles such as the\nresetting of under-water options and the lack of indexing at the industry level (Hall and\nMurphy, 2003), and more recently the options backdating scandal (Lie, 2005). However,\nthere is also a substantial body of research that supports the contrarian view that CEO pay\nlevels have little to do with weak boards (e.g. Holmstr\u00f6m and Kaplan, 2003; Gabaix and\nLandier, 2007; Frydman and Saks, 2007). Part of the reason for the con\u0087icting views about\nboards is that there is no robust empirical evidence that board independence improves \u0085rm\nperformance (Adams, Hermalin, and Weisbach, 2009), which is considered a puzzle by many\n\u0085nancial economists.2 Nevertheless, the view that strong boards are desirable is almost never\nquestioned.\nOne of our goals in this paper is to challenge this view. As with almost everything, board\nindependence comes with bene\u0085ts and costs. Corporate scandals are clear (and expensive)\nevidence that board monitoring may have been ine\u00a4ective. Because independent directors\nare assumed to be better monitors of CEOs, in times of corporate scandals there is a natural\ntendency to over-emphasize the bene\u0085ts of board independence and to forget about its costs.\nWe believe any serious attempt to evaluate the performance of boards should be guided by\na theory that takes the bene\u0085ts of board monitoring, but also its costs, into account.\nThe model we develop in this paper highlights an usually neglected cost of board mon-\n2 This empirical puzzle has led some to recognize that board independence alone might not be enough to\nimprove governance (e.g. Morck, 2004).\n1\nitoring: the possibility of breakdowns in communication between CEOs and directors. The\nspecial feature of this cost is that it arises endogenously and cannot be easily overcome. As\na consequence, since board monitoring is just one of many governance mechanisms, share-\nholders should rely less on board monitoring whenever communication between CEOs and\nboards is important. This argument is consistent with recent evidence that tough monitoring\nby boards may be detrimental to \u0085rm performance. Adams and Ferreira (2008) suggest that\ntough monitoring by boards can reduce \u0085rm value in \u0085rms that have few anti-takeover pro-\nvisions. Schmidt (2008) \u0085nds that management-friendly boards improve acquisition returns\nin \u0085rms in need of more board advice. Adams (2009a) \u0085nds evidence that directors who\nhave a stronger monitoring role perceive that they receive less information from the CEO.\nConsistent with board independence being costly, Ferreira, Ferreira and Raposo (2007) \u0085nd\nthat board independence is lower in \u0085rms in which external governance mechanisms are more\ne\u00a4ective.\nWe develop a model in which overmonitoring by the board may lead to a breakdown in\ncommunication between the CEO and the board. Recent theoretical papers on boards also\nemphasize communication between the CEO and the board (see e.g. Adams and Ferreira,\n2007). We add to this literature by explicitly analyzing the impact of CEO ownership and\nprivate bene\u0085ts on CEOs\u0092incentives to share information with the board. We also derive\nimplications for the optimal amount of board monitoring as a function of CEO ownership\nand private bene\u0085ts.\nOur model tries to capture important aspects of the special relationship between the\nCEO and corporate directors. The board monitors the CEO by observing measures of\nperformance, it decides whether to dismiss the CEO, and it also advises the CEO. Advice\nhere is over an investment decision, where the quality of the board\u0092s advice is improved if\nCEO provides it with some \u0085rm speci\u0085c information.\nDirectors generally agree that their main responsibility is to hire and \u0085re the CEO (Lorsch\nand MacIver, 1989), thus to ful\u0085ll their duty of ensuring the best possible leadership for the\n\u0085rm, directors collect information that helps them evaluate whether the CEO should remain\nCEO. We de\u0085ne this type of information collection to be the board\u0092s monitoring role.\nReplacing the CEO, however, is a right that directors seldom exercise. In times of\nnormalcy, directors spend much more time acting as a sounding board for management and\nadvising management on the strategic direction of the \u0085rm. Speci\u0085cally, the board uses\nthe expertise of its members to make recommendations to the CEO. Most board members,\n2\nhowever, need to rely on the CEO for \u0085rm-speci\u0085c information. Thus, the quality of the\nboard\u0092s advice is improved when the CEO shares its private information with the board.\nGiven that the board monitors him, a CEO who is uncertain about his ability may face\na trade-o\u00a4 in sharing information. On the one hand, the board will give better advice if the\nCEO shares his information. On the other hand, the additional information may cause the\nboard to revise its previous good opinion of the CEO and \u0085re him. As Lorsch and MacIver\n(1989, p. 181) point out \u0093each director is engaged in an ongoing assessment of the CEO\u0092s\nperformance, as he or she listens to the chief\u0092s report.\u0094 Information revealed by the CEO\nhelps the board disentangle the e\u00a4ects of CEO ability on corporate performance from those\ndue to conditions beyond the CEO\u0092s control. The more precise the board\u0092s information about\nthe CEO\u0092s ability, the greater the risk a CEO whose job is currently secure faces. Thus, a\nCEO may hesitate to communicate \u0085rm speci\u0085c information to a board that monitors him\ntoo intensively.3\nThe predictions of our model can be explored empirically. For example, the model implies\na (roughly) U-shaped relation between monitoring and CEO ownership and private bene\u0085ts,\ni.e. monitoring decreases then increases with CEO ownership and private bene\u0085ts. Our\ntheory suggests extensions to prior empirical analyses of these issues. Weisbach (1988)\nand Shivdasani and Yermack (1999) analyze the cross-sectional relationship between board\nindependence, CEO ownership, and CEO tenure. They \u0085nd that board independence is\nnegatively related to both CEO ownership and tenure. More recent evidence in Boone,\nFields, Karpo\u00a4 and Raheja (2007), Coles, Daniel and Naveen (2008) and Linck, Netter\nand Yang (2008) suggests these \u0085ndings are robust across samples and time periods. This\nevidence is consistent with CEOs taking an active role in in\u0087uencing the choice of directors\nand with more powerful CEOs being able to select a less independent board, as argued, for\nexample, by Hermalin and Weisbach (1998). Our model, however, suggests that previous\nempirical speci\u0085cations are not \u0087exible enough to capture more nuanced possibilities.\nWe predict that board monitoring should be related to CEO ownership and tenure in a\nnon-monotonic fashion. We show that allowing for these non-monotonicities by augmenting\nprevious speci\u0085cations encountered in the literature generates a di\u00a4erent pattern of evidence\nin a cross-section of \u0085rms. In particular, we \u0085nd that board independence and CEO owner-\n3 Our model is related to models in which strong incentives or monitoring intensity lead to \"rationally-\nmyopic\" behaviors by agents who manipulate or withhold information in detriment of long run pro\u0085ts. See\nfor example Stein (1989) or Tirole (2006, chapter 7).\n3\nship are negatively correlated when CEO ownership is low, but positively correlated when\nCEO ownership is su\u00a2 ciently high. Similarly, we \u0085nd that board independence and CEO\ntenure are negatively correlated when CEO tenure is low, but positively correlated when\nCEO tenured is su\u00a2 ciently high. While these \u0085ndings do not necessarily rule out the idea\nthat powerful CEOs select less independent boards, it is not clear how this explanation can\ngenerate the non-monotonic relationship we document.\nOur empirical results are fairly robust to changes in speci\u0085cations and are statistically\nand economically signi\u0085cant. Furthermore, the results are unchanged when we use a proxy\nfor board monitoring which tries to infer monitoring intensity from the total number of board\ncommittee meetings devoted to monitoring, rather than the proportion of outsiders on the\nboard as a measure of board monitoring. Recent literature argues that regulatory de\u0085nitions\nof director independence are \u0087awed because they do not capture social relations between\ndirectors and the CEO that may impair a director\u0092s judgement in monitoring (Cohen, Frazz-\nini and Malloy, 2009; Hwang and Kim, 2008). This new proxy circumvents this problem\nby focusing on director tasks. Furthermore, this proxy has fewer alternative interpretations\nthan director independence, which has also been used as a proxy for directors\u0092expertise (e.g.\nColes, Daniel and Naveen, 2008; Linck, Netter and Yang, 2008). We view the use of this\nproxy as an additional contribution of this paper.\nWe do not expect our \u0085ndings to be considered as ultimate evidence corroborating our\nmodel. In order to remain tractable, our model abstracts from many important issues, such\nas the design of optimal CEO compensation and the in\u0087uence of CEOs on the selection\nof directors. The evidence is not rich enough to separate every possible e\u00a4ect. Even more\nproblematic, causation cannot be inferred from correlation. However, we believe the evidence\nillustrates the importance of theory as a guide for empirical work. Our theory predicts a\nmore complex relationship between board monitoring and CEO ownership and tenure than\nthe ones that have been estimated so far in cross-sectional data. Without such a theory in\nmind, or another one that generates similar implications, there is no good reason to search\nfor these complex relationships in the data.\nOur analysis leads us to question the emphasis put on director independence in the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002, the revised listing standards at the NYSE and Nas-\ndaq, and the numerous recent governance codes around the world. We believe the problems\ndisplayed by banks in the recent \u0085nancial crisis support our argument that the costs of in-\ndependence may outweigh its bene\u0085ts when communication between directors and the CEO\n4\nis important. The activities of banks are arguably more complex than those of other institu-\ntions, which suggests that information exchange between CEOs and directors is essential in\norder for bank boards to carry out their responsibilities. Furthermore, on average CEOs of\nbanks have lower ownership than CEOs of non-\u0085nancial \u0085rms, as documented in Adams and\nMehran (2003). If we assume that we are in the region of our model where independence\nis increasing with ownership, this suggests that banks should have lower independence to\nencourage information-sharing. However, as Adams (2009b) documents, on average banks\nactually have higher levels of independence than non-\u0085nancial \u0085rms. One reason may be that\nregulators demand better compliance with SOX. Adams (2009b) provides further evidence\nthat increased independence may have decreased value for banks. She shows that banks\nthat were bailed out by the US government had more independent boards than other banks.\nWhile several explanations are possible, our analysis suggests that excess independence may\nhave lead to communication breakdowns between CEOs and boards. This interpretation\nis supported by the OECD Steering Group on Corporate Governance\u0092s (Kirkpatrick, 2009)\nargument that bank boards had problems obtaining information.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We discuss the related literature in\nSection 2. We develop the theory in Section 3 and discuss our empirical evidence in Section\n4. Section 5 concludes.\n2 Related Literature\nBecht, Bolton and R\u00f6ell (2002), in their survey of corporate governance, stress the relative\nscarcity of theoretical analyses of corporate boards, in contrast with other topics in corporate\ngovernance, such as takeovers and \u0085nancial contracting. Since then, there has been a sharp\nincrease in the number of theoretical papers concerned with boards. In this new generation\nof models, two ideas play a central role. First, it is acknowledged that boards not only\nmonitor management, but that they also have an important advisory role. Second, there is\na great emphasis on the problem of communication between the board and the CEO. Here\nwe brie\u0087y review four recent models in this tradition and discuss their relations with our\nmodel.\nIn Adams and Ferreira (2007), we analyze the con\u0087ict that arises when a board that\nhas a dual role as a monitor and as an advisor of management needs to extract relevant\ninformation from a CEO who dislikes excessive monitoring by the board. We show that it\n5\nmight be optimal for the board to commit to a low level of monitoring intensity in order to\nprovide the CEO with incentives to communicate openly with the board. The model in this\npaper shares these same features, but di\u00a4ers in two important aspects. First, as in previous\nworks on boards, such as Hermalin and Weisbach (1998) and Warther (1998), the need for\nboard monitoring arises from selection rather than moral hazard problems. Second, and\nmost importantly, the model in this paper generates predictions concerning the relationship\nbetween CEO ownership and board monitoring, which is the main contribution of this paper.\nIn Adams and Ferreira (2007), we model CEOs\u0092and shareholders\u0092incentive alignment in a\nreduced-form fashion, which does not enable us to generate implications for CEO ownership.\nRaheja (2005) also emphasizes the role of information transmission between the board\nand the CEO in a model in which outside directors are less informed than inside directors\nand the CEO. The distinguishing element in her analysis is her focus on the role of inside\ndirectors as providers of information that is useful for monitoring the CEO. Based on an\nexplicit modeling of the motivations and incentives of inside and outside directors, she derives\nimplications for the optimal size and composition of boards.\nSong and Thakor (2006) analyze a problem that is, in many aspects, similar to the one in\nthis paper. The main di\u00a4erence is that, in their model, not only the CEO but also directors\nhave career concerns. They show that directors\u0092 and CEOs\u0092 career concerns interact in\nimportant ways, and they generate many interesting implications that are unique to their\nframework. In particular, the CEO\u0092s incentives to disclose high-precision information to the\nboard depend crucially on the career concerns of board members.\nFinally, Harris and Raviv (2008) develop a model that combines many of the elements\nmentioned above. Their distinguishing feature is a focus on the optimal delegation of\ndecision-making between insiders and outsiders, leading to a theory of board control.\nThe model in this paper shares many features with the models discussed above. The\ndistinguishing feature of our model is its ability to generate implications relating CEO own-\nership, private bene\u0085ts, and board monitoring. Furthermore, we also provide some new\nevidence corroborating the model.\n3 Model\nIn section 3.1, we describe the setup of the model. In section 3.2 we analyze the model\nfor a \u0085xed monitoring intensity of the board. We relax the assumption that the monitoring\n6\nintensity is \u0085xed in section 3.3 and analyze the comparative statics of the board\u0092s monitoring\nintensity in section 3.4.\n3.1 Setup\n3.1.1 Timing\nOur model has three periods.\nPeriod 0 In period 0 the \u0085rm is established and shareholders hire a CEO. Shareholders\nchoose the optimal level of monitoring \u0019 to evaluate the CEO\u0092s ability. They choose a board\nthat will monitor the CEO with intensity \u0019. We interpret the monitoring intensity parameter\nas a measure of board independence. Alternatively, independence could a\u00a4ect the costs of\nmonitoring as in Adams and Ferreira (2007), leading to the same qualitative conclusion that\nmore independent boards monitor more intensively.\nThe CEO owns an exogenous fraction w of the \u0085rm, as the result of a compensation\npackage to induce unmodeled CEO e\u00a4ort, for example.\nPeriod 1 In period 1 the CEO and the board face a non-routine or innovative risky\ninvestment decision, such as whether to enter a new product market or not. We assume that\nthis decision is non-routine because on routine issues the board is unlikely to have much of\nan advisory role. The board observes its own private signal \" about the pro\u0085tability of the\nproject. The CEO also receives a private signal s about the \u0085rm\u0092s environment that will help\nhim choose whether or not to undertake the project. This information is uncorrelated with\nthe CEO\u0092s ability; for example, the information is about the \u0085rm\u0092s access to distribution\nchannels or the size of the market. However, a high-ability CEO receives a high-precision\nsignal of \u0085rm conditions.4\nThe CEO then decides whether to reveal his signal to the board or not. After listening\nto the CEO\u0092s report, the board advises the CEO on whether to implement the project or\nnot. We describe the advisory process in more detail below.\nAt the end of period 1, the CEO chooses whether to implement the project or not.\n4 Managerial ability is characterized in a similar way in Scharfstein and Stein (1990) and Prendergast\nand Stole (1996).\n7\nPeriod 2 At the beginning of period 2, the board investigates (monitors) the quality of\nthe CEO\u0092s information by collecting information about the \u0085rm\u0092s environment with intensity\n\u0019, and uses this information to update its beliefs about the CEO\u0092s ability. Shareholders (and\nthe board) care about managerial ability because CEOs with more precise signals will make\nbetter decisions. We assume that project \u0093output\u0094is not easily observable or, equivalently,\nthat the output can only be veri\u0085ed in the long run, while decisions about the retention of\nthe current CEO must be made before the output becomes fully observable.5 On the basis\nof its evaluation, the board decides whether to \u0085re the CEO and hire a replacement at the\nbeginning of the second period. The CEO loses his private bene\u0085ts if he is \u0085red, therefore\nhe cares about his job security.\nAt the end of period 2 the \u0085rm is liquidated and all players are compensated out of\n\u0085rst-period project revenues and second-period revenues.\n3.1.2 Remarks on the main assumptions\nSharing information with the board Before the board advises the CEO, the CEO\nmust decide whether to share his information with the board. Initially, the board believes\nthe ability of the CEO to be high enough so that it will not \u0085re him unless it obtains\ninformation that causes it to change its mind. The CEO is uncertain about his ability, thus\nany action he takes that allows the board to learn more about his ability imposes a risk\non him. Since his job is initially secure, learning by the board can only hurt him. If the\nboard did not monitor him, the CEO would reveal his information since it does not re\u0087ect\ndirectly on his ability, and with more information the board\u0092s advice is improved and the\nvalue of the CEO\u0092s shareholdings increases. However, when the board monitors him, the\nCEO\u0092s information enables the board to update its prior on the CEO\u0092s ability. Thus the\nboard\u0092s posterior on the CEO\u0092s ability is more precise when the CEO reveals his information.\nSince without monitoring the board would not have \u0085red him, the probability that the board\n\u0085res the CEO increases when the board has a more precise posterior on his ability.6 In\nmaking his decision, the CEO must weigh the e\u00a4ect his information has on the value of his\n5 This assumption can be relaxed. As long as the \u0085nal output is not completely informative about the\nCEO\u0092s ability, our model would still yield similar qualitative results. See also Ferreira and Rezende (2007).\n6 This is similar to the argument in Zwiebel (1995): with more information, the variance of the CEO\u0092s\nestimated ability increases, so if the CEO is of high ability getting a bad draw is more likely and will hurt\nhim. If the CEO is of low ability, his chances of getting a good draw increase and he is better o\u00a4. The\ndi\u00a4erence here is that the manager does not know his actual ability.\n8\nshareholdings versus on his job security.\nThe board can verify the CEO\u0092s information ex post, for example through reports, thus\nwhen the CEO communicates his information to the board, it is always accurate. We also\nassume that the board cannot induce the CEO to reveal his information by o\u00a4ering him a\ncontract.7 This is similar to Aghion and Tirole (1997), where the act of communicating\ninformation to the principal is noncontractible. Formally, this is a message game in which\nthe CEO can choose between two messages f;; sg, where ; stands for \u0093not reveal\u0094and s is\nthe CEO\u0092s information when he chooses to reveal, but the messages themselves cannot be\ncontracted on.8 Due to the limited time they spend in the \u0085rm, directors may not be able\nto evaluate what information they need unless management guides them, especially in the\nsituations in which the board is most likely to have an important advisory role: when the\nissue at hand is non-routine.9 This makes it di\u00a2 cult for them to implement contracts to\ninduce the CEO to reveal his information. One could incorporate this idea formally in our\nmodel by making the arrival of the signal stochastic. If the CEO does not always obtain a\nsignal, the board cannot punish the CEO for not revealing information.\nAdvising A crucial assumption in our analysis is that the quality of board\u0092s advice is higher\nwhen the CEO shares his private information with the board. There are many reasons why\nthis should be so. For example, the board might have limited time to evaluate competing\nprojects, and CEO\u0092s information might be useful in restricting the set of relevant projects\nthat need to be considered (Adams and Ferreira, 2007). Similarly, directors might have to\nexert costly e\u00a4ort to learn about investment opportunities and the CEO\u0092s private information\nabout \u0085rm-speci\u0085c conditions might reduce the board\u0092s marginal cost of learning. Finally,\nit could also be that the combined board expertise \" is too complex to be transmitted in a\nsimple message, thus knowledge of the CEO\u0092s information might be useful in determining\nwhich types of simple messages (a subset of the information contained in \") the board should\nsend to the CEO.\n7 In fact, because his shareholdings increase in value when he reveals, the CEO does get a payo\u00a4 for\nrevealing. If the board can give him enough shares, the CEO will reveal, as we show later. However, in\nsome cases it may be too costly for the board to induce revelation. This could correspond to a case where\nthe CEO\u0092s contract (number of shares) is \u0085xed ex ante and new projects arise unexpectedly. It may be too\ncostly to renegotiate the contract whenever this happens.\n8 Milgrom (1981) provides an early example of such a model.\n9 See Demb and Neubauer (1992, pp. 116-128) for a discussion of the problem that directors may not\nknow the right questions to ask when the CEO\u0092s strategy is not to disclose.\n9\nFor our results to hold, it is immaterial which of these cases is assumed. Accordingly, we\nwill simply assume that the quality of the board\u0092s advice is higher when the CEO reveals his\ninformation. A rationalization of such an assumption can be found in Adams and Ferreira\n(2007), although in a di\u00a4erent setup.\n3.1.3 Output Technology\nThe project outcome (if undertaken) at the end of the \u0085rst period is given by\ny1 = \u0012 + \"\u0000 c; (1)\nwhere \u0012 is a parameter re\u0087ecting \u0085rm-speci\u0085c conditions, \" is a parameter re\u0087ecting the\nboard\u0092s expertise concerning industry or economy-wide conditions and c is the (a priori\nknown) cost of undertaking the project. If the project is not undertaken, y1 = 0:\nTo simplify the board\u0092s \u0085ring strategy, \u0085rm revenues at the end of the second period are\ngiven by y2 = \u000b, where \u000b is the CEO\u0092s ability. The board will dismiss the CEO if expected\nsecond period output under his leadership, b\u000b, is less than expected second period output, \u000b,\nunder a replacement CEO, i.e. b\u000b < \u000b.\nWe interpret the project implementation decision as a one-shot strategic decision that\nhas long-term implications. After the \u0085rm makes the decision, the board may replace the\ncurrent CEO with a new one. However, this change can only a\u00a4ect part of the total long-run\noutput, y = y1 + y2; namely y2. We interpret the \u0085rst component y1 as the part of the\noutcome that is due to the implementation decision only and is not a\u00a4ected by the identity\nof the CEO in charge.\n3.1.4 Information\nAt the beginning of period zero, neither the board nor the CEO knows the CEO\u0092s ability \u000b;\nthe exact \u0085rm-speci\u0085c conditions \u0012 or the general conditions \". Instead, they have common\npriors over \u000b, \u0012 and \". They believe \u000b, \u0012 and \" are independently distributed, with \u000b = \u000bH\nwith probability q and \u000b = \u000bL with probability 1\u0000 q. For simplicity, \u0085rm speci\u0085c conditions\ncan be either good \u0012G or bad \u0012B with equal probabilities. The random variable representing\nthe board\u0092s expertise concerning industry or economy-wide conditions \" has a cumulative\ndistribution function F (:), which is continuous and has an unbounded domain.10 At the\n10 These conditions are actually stronger than we need. We make them for simplicity.\n10\nend of period zero, the CEO observes a signal s 2 f\u0012B; \u0012Gg of the \u0085rm-speci\u0085c conditions.\nThe signal s equals the true value of \u0012 with probability 1 if the CEO has high ability \u000bH\nand with probability p > 1\n2\nif the CEO has low ability \u000bL. Therefore, better CEOs receive\nmore precise estimates of true \u0085rm conditions \u0012.\nSince CEOs do not know their ability, they are not able to signal their ability or can\n\u0085rms sort CEOs ex ante by o\u00a4ering a menu of contracts. This is a common assumption in\nthe literature on career concerns initiated by Holmstr\u00f6m (1982\/1999).\n3.1.5 Monitoring Technology\nThe board monitors the CEO with probability \u0019, which we call its monitoring intensity.\nMonitoring has two elements. When the board monitors, it may get a direct signal of the\nCEO\u0092s ability \u000b and also a signal of \u0085rm conditions \u0012. It learns the true managerial ability\n\u000b with probability t and the true \u0085rm conditions \u0012 with probability 1. Both signals will be\nused in updating the board\u0092s beliefs about the CEO\u0092s ability. For simplicity, we assume that\nthe board does not observe any of the other actions of the CEO\u0092s, including the decision\nconcerning the project.11\nInitially, the common prior on the CEO\u0092s ability is\n\u000b = q\u000bH + (1\u0000 q)\u000bL: (2)\nIf the board observes \u0012 but not \u000b, it will update its beliefs about the CEO if and only\nif it also observes the CEO\u0092s signal s. In this case, the CEO\u0092s signal matches the board\u0092s\nsignal, i.e. s = \u0012, with probability 1 if the CEO is good and probability p if the CEO is bad.\nTherefore, the unconditional probability of matching signals is P (s = \u0012) \u0011 q+(1\u0000 q) p and\nthe posterior beliefs on the mean of \u000b are\n\u000b (s = \u0012) =\nq\nP (s = \u0012)\n\u000bH +\n(1\u0000 q) p\nP (s = \u0012)\n\u000bL; (3)\n\u000b (s 6= \u0012) = \u000bL:\nSince the board would not have wanted to \u0085re the CEO at the beginning of the \u0085rst period,\nwhen the CEO\u0092s expected ability is \u000b, the board will not \u0085re the CEO at the beginning of\n11 This assumption can be relaxed without qualitative changes in the results. As long as the decision\nconcerning project implementation does not fully reveal the CEO\u0092s private information, the same trade-o\u00a4\npersists if we allow the board to observe the CEO\u0092s actions.\n11\nthe second period unless it obtains new information through monitoring. We summarize the\nboard\u0092s \u0085ring strategy formally in the following proposition.\nProposition 1 (Firing Rule) The board will \u0085re the CEO if and only if:\n1. It observes the CEO\u0092s ability through monitoring (which happens with probability t)\nand learns that \u000b = \u000bL, or\n2. it does not observe the CEO\u0092s ability directly, but learns that the CEO\u0092s signal s does\nnot match its own signal \u0012, i.e. s 6= \u0012.\nWhen the board makes its recommendation concerning project implementation to the\nCEO, it either knows the CEO\u0092s signal s or not. We denote its information at this point by\ni 2 f\u0012B; \u0012G; ;g. We have that i = s if the board learns the CEO\u0092s signal s and i = ; if it\ndoes not learn.\nGiven the board\u0092s \u0085ring rule, the expected second period output when the board monitors,\nM(i); will depend on its information i:\nM (s) = t [q\u000bH + (1\u0000 q)\u000b] + (1\u0000 t) fP (s = \u0012)\u000b (s = \u0012) + [1\u0000 P (s = \u0012)]\u000bg ; (4)\nM (;) = t [q\u000bH + (1\u0000 q)\u000b] + (1\u0000 t)\u000b:\nSince\nM (s)\u0000M (;) = (1\u0000 t) fq\u000bH + (1\u0000 q) p\u000bL + [(1\u0000 q) (1\u0000 p)\u0000 1]\u000bg > 0; (5)\nexpected second period output is higher when monitoring is more informed, i.e. when the\nboard learns s. We call the di\u00a4erenceN \u0011M (s)\u0000M (;) the gains from informed monitoring.\n3.1.6 Preferences\nWe will assume that when the board \u0085res him, the CEO retains his shares w.12 In addition,\nthe CEO receives control bene\u0085ts of b if he remains in control at the end of the second period.\nThus the CEO\u0092s utility function is given by\nUM = w(y1 + y2) + b\u001fRemain in control; (6)\n12 It does not alter the analysis much if he loses his shares and it simpli\u0085es some of the comparative statics.\nIn fact managers do receive golden parachutes and if their shares are accumulated for their own accounts\nthey cannot be taken away. Only if the manager is given phantom or restricted stock can his stock privileges\nbe revoked.\n12\nwhere\n\u001fRemain in control =\n(\n1\n0\nif the CEO is not \u0085red\nif the CEO is \u0085red.\n(7)\nThrough his share in \u0085rst period output the CEO is interested in making a successful\nproject implementation decision. However, he also cares about his job security because if\nhe is \u0085red he may lose his control bene\u0085ts. In making his decision about whether to reveal,\ntherefore, the CEO faces the trade-o\u00a4 that revealing information increases expected output\nbut is also costly because it may increase the probability that he is \u0085red.\nThe board is risk-neutral. We will assume that the board cares only about increasing\n\u0085rm-value, y = y1 + y2. However, the extent to which the board can increase \u0085rm value is\nlimited because, in order to analyze the trade-o\u00a4 to the CEO induced by the board\u0092s dual\nrole, we assume initially that the board\u0092s monitoring intensity \u0019 is \u0085xed.\nWith probability \u0019 the board monitors, in which case expected second period output\ngiven its information is M(i): With probability 1\u0000 \u0019 the board does not monitor, in which\ncase it does not \u0085re the CEO. Therefore, the board\u0092s expected utility function is given by:\nEUB = E [y1 + \u0019M(i) + (1\u0000 \u0019)\u000b] (8)\n3.2 Analysis of the Model for a Fixed Monitoring Intensity\nThis section analyses the model when the board\u0092s monitoring intensity \u0019 is \u0085xed. In section\n3.3 we relax this assumption.\nAt each of its information sets along the equilibrium path the board must behave opti-\nmally given its beliefs. It chooses whether or not to recommend project implementation and\ngathers information on \u0085rm-speci\u0085c conditions with monitoring intensity \u0019. If the board\nmonitors, it observes \u0012 with probability 1 and updates its beliefs about the CEO\u0092s ability\nif it also observes \u000b or if it learns the CEO\u0092s signal s. It then decides whether to \u0085re the\nCEO. The CEO must decide whether or not to reveal his information and whether or not to\nimplement the project given the board\u0092s recommendation.\nWe focus on strategy pro\u0085les and belief systems for the board and the CEO that constitute\nperfect Bayesian equilibria. When the game is in its monitoring phase, the board\u0092s optimal\nbehavior is fully characterized by its \u0085ring rule derived in Proposition 1. Therefore, in\nsubsection 3.2.1 we only consider the e\u00a4ects of the players\u0092behaviors on \u0085rst-period output y1.\nWe then work backwards and analyze the CEO\u0092s decision to share information in subsection\n13\n3.2.2.\n3.2.1 Information and the Quality of Advice\nThis section describes the advice the board gives to the CEO and the CEO\u0092s optimal choice\nof whether to follow the board\u0092s advice or not.\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the continuation games that arise after\nthe CEO\u0092s decision to share information is made. There are only two possible types of\ncontinuation games at this stage: one in which the board learns the CEO\u0092s signal s and one\nin which it does not.\nWhen the CEO\u0092s and the board\u0092s strategies constitute an equilibrium, we denote the\nCEO\u0092s expectation of the \u0085rst period outcome given his signal s when he reveals his infor-\nmation to the board (i.e. i = s) by E [y1 j s; i = s]. Similarly, when the CEO does not reveal\nhis information to the board (i.e. i = ;), this expectation is E [y1 j s; i = ;]. Implicitly in\nthe de\u0085nition of these expectations we are assuming Bayesian updating of probabilities along\nthe equilibrium path.\nWe de\u0085ne the advisory bene\u0085ts from information sharing as\nR (s) \u0011 E [y1 j s; i = s]\u0000 E [y1 j s; i = ;] : (9)\nOur results depend only on the following weak assumption on the function R (s).\nAssumption 1 (Information Sharing Implies Better Advice):\n1. The advisory bene\u0085ts from information sharing are non-negative for all s:\nR (s) \u0015 0;\n2. At least one of R (\u0012B) and R (\u0012G) is strictly positive:\nmax fR (\u0012G) ; R (\u0012B)g > 0:\nThe main implications of our model depend only on these two properties of the function\nR (s). For simplicity, we state them as an assumption, but an explicit modeling of the\ncommunication game in which these properties emerge endogenously is available from the\nauthors.\n14\n3.2.2 The Decision to Share Information\nHere we analyze the \u0085rst-period decision problem for the CEO. To decide his strategy the\nCEO compares his expected utilities from revealing and not revealing his information. The\nexpected utility for the CEO when the board learns his information is given by\nEUM (s; i = s) = wE [y1 j s; i = s] + \u0019wM (s) + (1\u0000 \u0019)w\u000b+ b (10)\n\u0000\u0019 ft (1\u0000 q) + (1\u0000 t) [q + (1\u0000 q) (1\u0000 p)]g b:\nIf the board does not learn s, the CEO\u0092s expected utility is given by\nEUM (s; i = ;) = wE [y1 j s; i = ;] + \u0019wM (;) + (1\u0000 \u0019)w\u000b+ b\u0000 \u0019t (1\u0000 q) b: (11)\nThe monitoring bene\u0085ts from information sharing are given by \u0019w (M (s)\u0000M (;)) =\n\u0019wN . We de\u0085ne the costs from information sharing to be\nC = \u0019 (1\u0000 t) [q + (1\u0000 q) (1\u0000 p)] b: (12)\nIt is important to note that the costs from information revealing increase both with the\nmonitoring intensity \u0019 and with the private bene\u0085ts of control b. To simplify notation, we\nde\u0085ne\n\u0014 \u0011 (1\u0000 t) [q + (1\u0000 q) (1\u0000 p)] : (13)\nWe now characterize the equilibrium when the monitoring intensity \u0019 is \u0085xed. For sim-\nplicity, we assume that when the CEO is indi\u00a4erent between revealing or not revealing his\nsignal to the board in equilibrium, he will choose to reveal.\nDe\u0085ne \u00190 as\n\u00190 \u0011 wmax fR (\u0012G) ; R (\u0012B)g\n\u0014b\u0000 wN : (14)\nWe have the following result:\nProposition 2 (Monitoring Intensity and Information Sharing) The equilibrium is\nsuch that:\n1. if \u0014b > wN , and\n(a) if \u0019 \u0014 \u00190 , the CEO always reveals s;\n15\n(b) if \u0019 > \u00190, the CEO never reveals s:\n2. If \u0014b \u0014 wN , the CEO always reveals s:\nAccording to this proposition, there exist equilibria in which CEOs will not share infor-\nmation with the board. Since \u0085rm value is higher when the CEO does share his information,\nthis proposition provides the motivation for boards who take their \u0085duciary duties seriously\nto \u0085nd instruments with which they can increase the CEO\u0092s net gain to sharing information.\nWhen it is too costly for a \u0085rm\u0092s board to a\u00a4ect the CEO\u0092s incentives to share information,\nthis proposition explains why the shareholders will change their board in order to \u0085nd one\nwith which the CEO will communicate.\n3.3 Endogenizing the Board\u0092s Monitoring Intensity\nIn the previous section, we argue that when the board\u0092s preference for monitoring is \u0085xed,\nCEOs may not share their information with the board, depending on whether \u0019 > \u00190 or not.\nHere we discuss the equilibria that arise when the board commits to a choice of monitoring\nintensity ex ante in order to maximize shareholder value. We will assume that it costs the\nboard d(\u0019) to change its monitoring intensity \u0019.13 We assume d (0) = 0; d0 > 0; d00 >\n0; lim\u0019!0 d0 (\u0019) = 0; lim\u0019!1 d0 (\u0019) =1:\nFor the sake of brevity, we assume from now on that \u0014b > wN; so that only part 1 of\nProposition 2 is relevant. If this assumption does not hold, the problem is still well de\u0085ned.\nHowever, the monitoring bene\u0085ts from information sharing would always be larger than the\ncosts from information sharing, implying that the CEO faces no trade-o\u00a4 between revealing\nand not revealing. We therefore focus on the more interesting case in which this trade-o\u00a4 is\npresent, which is more likely to occur when private bene\u0085ts of control b are high and CEO\nownership w are low.\nLet m (s; \u0019) be the message the CEO sends to the board when his private information is\ns and the monitoring intensity is \u0019. From proposition 2, we have that\nm (s; \u0019) =\n(\ns; if \u0019 \u0014 \u00190\n;, if \u0019 > \u00190 : (15)\n13 For example, this could be a result of coordination costs (e.g. Yermack, 1996).\n16\nMessages a\u00a4ect \u0085rst period outcomes through their e\u00a4ect on the quality of the advice\nthe board can o\u00a4er to the CEO:\nE [y1 j m (s; \u0019)] =\n(\n1\n2\nE [y1 j s = \u0012G; i = s] + 12E [y1 j s = \u0012B; i = s] ; if m (s; \u0019) = s\n1\n2\nE [y1 j s = \u0012G; i = ;] + 12E [y1 j s = \u0012B; i = ;] ; if m (s; \u0019) = ;:\n(16)\nMessages a\u00a4ect second-period outcomes through their e\u00a4ect on the quality of the board\u0092s\nmonitoring M [m (s; \u0019)].\nThe board\u0092s problem can then be written as\nmax\n\u0019\nE [y1 j m (s; \u0019)] + \u0019M [m (s; \u0019)] + (1\u0000 \u0019)\u000b\u0000 d (\u0019) (17)\nThe next proposition describe the main properties of the equilibrium.\nProposition 3 (Optimal Choice of Monitoring) The equilibrium is always unique (with\nrespect to the choice of \u0019) and it is of one of the following three types:\n1. The optimal monitoring intensity \u0019\u0003 is \u0019f < \u00190 and the CEO shares his information\nm (s; \u0019\u0003) = s. Furthermore, the board chooses the \u0085rst-best level of monitoring and\nboth \u0085rst- and second-period outputs are at their \u0085rst-best levels.\n2. The optimal monitoring intensity \u0019\u0003 is \u00190 and the CEO shares his informationm (s; \u0019\u0003) =\ns. Although the \u0085rst-best level of outcome is achieved in period one, the same is not\ntrue for the second period outcome, since there is too little monitoring.\n3. The optimal monitoring intensity \u0019\u0003 is \u0019n > \u00190 and the CEO does not share his in-\nformation m (s; \u0019\u0003) = ;. Neither the \u0085rst- nor the second-period outputs are at their\n\u0085rst-best levels.\nIn the \u0085rst equilibrium the CEO\u0092s revelation constraint is not binding. In the second\nequilibrium the CEO\u0092s revelation constraint is binding but the value of the CEO\u0092s information\nis high enough that the board will optimally commit to a smaller monitoring intensity than\nthe \u0085rst best level to induce the CEO to reveal it.14 In the third equilibrium the CEO\u0092s\nrevelation constraint is binding but it is too costly to induce the CEO to reveal. Since, the\nboard\u0092s preferred monitoring intensity is highest when there is full communication (since the\noption value of \u0085ring the CEO is highest when he reveals), we de\u0085ne the board\u0092s preference\nfor less than \u0085rst best monitoring to be management friendliness.\n14 The argument that in certain situations too much information may hurt the principal has been studied\nin other contexts. For example, Aghion and Tirole (1997) discuss how a principal may choose to delegate\nformal authority to an agent when the agent\u0092s private bene\u0085ts are high or when the principal cannot refrain\nfrom hurting the agent. With more formal authority, the agent will participate more in the organization (e.g.\ncommunicate information). Similarly, Burkart, Gromb and Panunzi (1997) consider the trade-o\u00a4 between\nmore initiative by management and more control through monitoring by shareholders.\n17\n3.4 Comparative Statics on the Board\u0092s Monitoring Intensity\nHere we discuss the results linking cross sectional di\u00a4erences in monitoring intensity \u0019 to\nCEO\u0092s shareholdings and his private bene\u0085ts\nAs CEO ownership increases, his net gain to revealing his information increases. Thus,\nthe optimal monitoring intensity in a sample of \u0085rms di\u00a4ering in the amount of CEO own-\nership will vary non-monotonically as follows:\nProposition 4 (Relation between equilibrium monitoring and CEO ownership)\nThere exist levels of CEO ownership wf and wn where 0 < wn < wf such that:\n1. the monitoring intensity of the board is at its \u0085rst-best level \u0019f if CEO ownership is\ngreater than wf ;\n2. the optimal monitoring intensity of the board is \u0019\u0003 = \u00190 if CEO ownership is between\nwf and wn;\n3. the optimal monitoring intensity of the board is \u0019\u0003 = \u0019n if CEO ownership is below\nwn.\nThe optimal monitoring intensity is a non-monotonic function of w. When w is very low,\nboards monitor with intensity \u0019n. Beyond wn, monitoring initially drops then rises again.\nAt wn there is a discrete jump in the board\u0092s monitoring intensity due to the fact that the\nCEO makes a discrete choice to reveal or not.\nAs the CEO\u0092s concern about being \u0085red increases, he is less likely to reveal his infor-\nmation. Thus as b increases it will become more costly to induce him to reveal. Since \u0085rm\nvalue is independent of the CEO\u0092s private bene\u0085ts b, the analysis of the optimal monitoring\nintensity as a function of b is similar to the analysis for ownership. As a function of his\nprivate bene\u0085ts, optimal monitoring varies non-monotonically as follows:\nProposition 5 (Relation between equilibrium monitoring and CEO private bene-\n\u0085ts) There exist levels of private control bene\u0085ts bf and bn where 0 < bf < bn such that:\n1. the monitoring intensity of the board is at the \u0085rst-best level \u0019f if private bene\u0085ts are\nless than bf ;\n2. the optimal monitoring intensity of the board is \u0019\u0003 = \u00190 if private bene\u0085ts are between\nbf and bn;\n3. the optimal monitoring intensity of the board is \u0019\u0003 = \u0019n if private bene\u0085ts are above\nbn.\n18\nAs is the case for ownership, the optimal monitoring intensity is a non-monotonic function\nof b: When b is low, boards monitor with the \u0085rst best intensity \u0019f . Beyond bf , monitoring\ndecreases then jumps up again to \u0019n.\n4 Testable Implications and Some Evidence\nThe model implies a (roughly) U-shaped relation between board monitoring and both CEO\nownership and private bene\u0085ts, i.e. monitoring decreases then increases with these character-\nistics of the CEO\u0092s incentive structure. Thus, while it would be di\u00a2 cult to test the model\u0092s\nimplications concerning the extent to which CEOs share information with their boards,15\nthe implied cross-sectional relationships between monitoring and both incentive alignment\nand private bene\u0085ts can, in principle, be examined empirically. Using a cross section of 358\nFortune 500 \u0085rms in \u0085scal 1998, we conduct a brief examination to determine whether the\nevidence appears consistent with the predictions of the model.\nThe key step to implementing the empirical examination is to develop appropriate prox-\nies for the board\u0092s monitoring intensity. The proxies for the CEO\u0092s ownership and private\nbene\u0085ts are more straightforward.\nProxies for the board\u0092s monitoring intensity In accordance with the traditional\nassumption that board composition determines the board\u0092s monitoring strength, we rein-\nterpret the probability that the board monitors the CEO as a \u0085xed parameter representing\nthe percentage of outside directors on the board (see e.g. Baysinger and Butler, 1985, and\nHermalin and Weisbach, 2003). This proxy has been criticized for not taking into account\nsocial relations between directors and the CEO (Cohen, Frazzini and Malloy, 2009; Hwang\nand Kim, 2008). Furthermore, it may also be \u0087awed if inside directors have information that\nallows them to be more e\u00a4ective monitors.\nWe also use a di\u00a4erent proxy for the board\u0092s monitoring intensity than previously used.\nIn particular, we attempt to measure the monitoring intensity of the board independently of\nits advisory function by using a proxy developed in Adams (2003). We use board committee\ndescriptions as a way of separating the board\u0092s monitoring from its non-monitoring tasks.\nThen we construct a proxy for the probability that the board monitors the CEO by using\n15 Although see Adams (2009a) and Schmidt (2008) for some recent steps in this direction.\n19\ncommittee size and meeting data to estimate the proportion of director meetings allocated\nto monitoring duties. This proxy combines the idea that activity (the number of meetings)\nmatters for monitoring as well as the number of directors monitoring.16\nSince this proxy is based on board activity and size, it is independent of board com-\nposition. Boards and committees either have regular or special meetings. However, special\nmeetings are rare.17 Thus it is plausible that directors can commit to a given monitoring\nintensity through their scheduling of board and committee meetings. One advantage of this\nproxy is that it avoids the problem pointed out in recent literature that regulatory de\u0085nitions\nof director independence are \u0087awed because they do not capture social relations between di-\nrectors and the CEO (Cohen, Frazzini and Malloy, 2009; Hwang and Kim, 2008). Another\nadvantage is that it has fewer alternative interpretations than independence, which can also\nproxy for the extent to which the board has \u0085rm-speci\u0085c knowledge, as in Coles, Daniel and\nNaveen (2008).\nProxies for CEO ownership and private bene\u0085ts We proxy the extent to which\nCEOs care about increasing \u0085rm value by their shareholdings. Because in the model the\nCEO cares about his job security due to fear of losing his private bene\u0085ts, it is reasonable\nto assume that the longer the CEO has been in the \u0085rm the smaller are his private bene\u0085ts\n(because there are fewer periods remaining until retirement). Thus, consistent with Gibbons\nand Murphy (1992) and Brickley, Coles and Linck (1999), we use a measure of CEO tenure\nto proxy for the CEO\u0092s internal career concerns.\nWe also use a dummy variable indicating whether the CEO is also the chairman of the\nboard as a measure of his private bene\u0085ts. Many \u0085rms (see e.g. Vancil 1987) have a well-\nde\u0085ned succession process that can be described as follows: the president, (or other heir\napparent to the CEO) becomes CEO and president. After a probationary period he receives\nthe additional title of chairman. As part of his succession process he relinquishes \u0085rst the\ntitle of president, then the title of CEO, and \u0085nally the title of chairman. Once the CEO\nbecomes chairman he has no further title to aspire to, so his concerns about job security\nare likely to be smaller than before. In addition, he is more likely to be closer to the end\n16 The assumption that the number of directors matters for monitoring is similar to the assumption in the\nliterature that uses the supervisor\/worker ratio to test e\u00a2 ciency wage theories (see Prendergast, 1999, for a\nsummary).\n17 Only 5.5% of the sample \u0085rms had special board meetings. Only 4% of the 1561 board committees in\nthe sample \u0085rms had special meetings.\n20\nof his career than the beginning. Thus we expect to observe a positive relation between the\nCEO=chair dummy and the monitoring intensity of the board.\n4.1 Data sources and Description\nFor all publicly traded Fortune 500 companies in 1998 for which we could obtain proxy\nstatements or 10-Ks from Disclosure Global Access we collected data on board and CEO\ncharacteristics during \u0085scal 1998. We exclude \u0085nancial \u0085rms and utilities. Our \u0085nal sample\nconsists of 358 \u0085rms.\nFor each \u0085rm we collected the following information about its board: the proportion of\ninsiders, board size, number of meetings, the number and types of committees, and the size\nand number of meetings of each committee during \u0085scal 1998. For six of the \u0085rms we could\nonly obtain 10-Ks that do not disclose committee information. Thus our \u0085nal sample of\ncommittees contains 1565 committees from 352 \u0085rms. In addition we collected the number\nof years the CEO has been on the board and the proportion of shares the CEO holds in the\n\u0085rm.18 Financial data are from Compustat. Data on the number of years since the date of\nincorporation are from Moody\u0092s manuals.\nSince proxy statements only selectively disclose the year the CEO joined the \u0085rm, we use\nthe number of years the CEO has been on the board as a proxy for the CEO\u0092s tenure in the\n\u0085rm. We de\u0085ne the proportion of outsiders on the board to be the proportion of directors\nwho do not work for the \u0085rm.\nWe construct our second proxy for the board\u0092s monitoring intensity as follows: we de-\n\u0085ne meeting units spent on the work of a committee to be the number of directors on the\ncommittee times the number of regular meetings of that committee during \u0085scal 1998. The\nnumber of meeting units spent on monitoring duties is the sum of meeting units devoted to\nthe compensation, audit, corporate governance, nominating, non-managing director, succes-\nsion, and stock option committees. Total meeting units are the sum of total meeting units\nspent on committee work and the meeting units spent on board work (=board size times\nnumber of regular board meetings). A proxy for the board\u0092s monitoring intensity is then the\nfraction of total meeting units spent monitoring (for more information see Adams, 2003).\nTable 1 shows descriptive statistics for selected \u0085nancial and board characteristics. The\n18 We de\u0085ne the CEO\u0092s shareholdings to be the sum of common shares, deferred shares, restricted shares\nand shares held for family members minus options exercisable within 60 days.\n21\ncorrelation between the fraction of outsiders and the fraction of total meeting units spent\nmonitoring is 0.24, thus the dependent variables seem to be su\u00a2 ciently di\u00a4erent to warrant\nusing both.\n4.2 Empirical Results\nSeveral empirical papers have already found a negative relationship between both top man-\nagement ownership and tenure and the proportion of outsiders on the board (for example\nShivdasani and Yermack, 1999). To capture the non-monotonicity predicted by our model\nwe add quadratic terms of ownership and tenure to similar regressions. In addition, we\ninclude the CEO=chairman dummy. To be consistent with the roughly U-shaped relations\npredicted by our model, we expect to \u0085nd that the coe\u00a2 cients on these additional terms are\npositive.\nAs \u0085rm level controls we include the natural log of book value of assets as a measure\nof size, capital expenditures over sales as a measure of growth, the number of 2-digit SIC\nsegments the \u0085rm operates in as a measure of diversi\u0085cation, the number of years since the\ndate of incorporation as a measure of age, return on assets as a measure of performance and\nleverage (long term debt\/book value of assets). In addition all speci\u0085cations include 2-digit\nSIC industry dummies.\nTable 2 presents the coe\u00a2 cient estimates for all speci\u0085cations using board composition\nas the dependent variable. White\u0092s robust t-statistics are in parentheses to correct for\npotential heteroskedasticity. To compare to the previous literature, Column I of table 2\nshows the results of the OLS regression without the quadratic terms for CEO tenure and\nownership. The signs, magnitudes and pattern of signi\u0085cance of the estimated coe\u00a2 cients\non CEO tenure, ownership and the CEO=chairman dummy are very similar to the estimates\nin a cross section of 336 Fortune 500 \u0085rms in Shivdasani and Yermack (1999, Table IV, \u0085rst\ncolumn).19\nIn Column II we add the quadratic terms for CEO tenure and ownership. Consistent with\nthe implications of the model, the coe\u00a2 cients on both quadratic terms and the coe\u00a2 cient\non the CEO=chairman dummy are positive, with the coe\u00a2 cient on the square of ownership\nsigni\u0085cant at the 5% level and the CEO=chairman dummy signi\u0085cant at the 1% level. Once\n19 Shivdasani and Yermack (1999) use a non-CEO chairman of the board dummy, so the sign on the\nCEO=chairman dummy is the opposite of the estimated coe\u00a2 cient in their paper.\n22\nwe include the quadratic term, ownership also becomes signi\u0085cant (at the 5% level) unlike\nin Column I, suggesting that the quadratic term was an omitted variable in Column I. In\nColumns III and IV we include the quadratic terms for tenure and ownership separately\nwith similar results. In Column V we replicate Column II with board size and number\nof committees as additional board level controls as in Shivdasani and Yermack (1999). All\nrelevant explanatory variables are signi\u0085cant with the predicted signs in this speci\u0085cation.\nIn Table 3 we present the results using the fraction of total meeting units devoted to\nmonitoring as a proxy for the board\u0092s monitoring intensity. Overall the results are similar to\nthose in Table 2, yet suggest even more strongly than the results in Table 2 that the relation-\nship between the monitoring intensity by the board and both CEO tenure and ownership is\nnon-linear as implied by the model.\nThe estimated e\u00a4ects also appear to be economically signi\u0085cant. For example, if the CEO\nis not the chairman of the board, the board\u0092s monitoring intensity is reduced by 0.06-0.08\n(0.04-0.05) when the dependent variable is the fraction of outsiders (the fraction of meeting\nunits devoted to monitoring) compared to when the CEO is the chairman of the board. This\nrepresents a reduction of approximately one half of the standard deviation in the board\u0092s\nmonitoring intensity.\nIf we focus on our new measure of monitoring (Table 3), we \u0085nd that the non-monotonic\ne\u00a4ects are also economically meaningful. Our results suggest that monitoring decreases with\ntenure in the \u0085rst two years and increases with tenure after 3 years. It is interesting to note\nthat it usually takes two years for the CEO to become the chair of the board. Monitoring\nalso decreases with CEO ownership until 19%, when it starts to increase with ownership.\nNote that, according to our model, monitoring should only increase with ownership when the\nCEO becomes fully aligned with shareholders (concerning the information sharing decision).\nAlthough potential endogeneity problems weaken the interpretation of the evidence, we\nconclude that the raw evidence is at least not inconsistent with the empirically testable\nimplications of the model. In addition, while the results could also be consistent with\nother explanations, we are unaware of other theories predicting a non-monotonic relationship\nbetween board monitoring and CEO career concerns and ownership. For example, the results\ndo not appear consistent with traditional agency stories that predict that CEO power (or\nentrenchment) is negatively associated with monitoring by the board. In such a case, one\nmight expect that when the CEO is the chairman of the board, monitoring by the board\ndecreases. In contrast, we \u0085nd that when the CEO takes on both roles, monitoring by\n23\nthe board increases. In addition, the entrenchment hypothesis implies that monitoring by\nthe board should decline over the course of the CEO\u0092s tenure (Hermalin and Weisbach,\n1998). The increase in monitoring close to a CEO\u0092s retirement here is inconsistent with this\nprediction.\n5 Conclusion\nExplicit theories of boards are useful, mostly because they can suggest new ways of looking\nat the data. Our model has new empirical implications. Although our evidence in this paper\nis only suggestive, it does raise some questions concerning the interpretation of previous\nempirical \u0085ndings. A super\u0085cial glance at the empirical evidence may sometimes suggest\nthat boards are structured in ways that are not consistent with shareholder value maximiza-\ntion. Our preliminary evidence in this paper suggests more caution in drawing inferences\nfrom data: there are some cross-sectional relationships between board monitoring, CEO\nownership, and CEO tenure that defy explanations based on CEO power alone. Much more\nempirical work is needed to assess the importance of CEO power for the design of gover-\nnance structures. This is especially important because governance reform has been and will\ncontinue to be an important priority for policy makers.\nWe believe recent governance reform proposals may have overemphasized the idea that in-\ndependence serves to limit CEO power. Our analysis suggests that the value of independence\ndepends on other incentive mechanisms in place. Furthermore, the value of independence is\nnot linear. Thus, simply mandating an increase in independence for all \u0085rms is not the so-\nlution to governance problems in all \u0085rms. Furthermore, focusing primarily on one incentive\nmechanism may cause additional governance problems. Our analysis suggests, for example,\nthat \u0085rms may respond to increases in independence by increasing CEO ownership. But,\nincreases in ownership may lead to potentially excessive risk-taking by CEOs. The recent\nconcern about bank governance during the \u0085nancial crisis illustrates that SOX and the NYSE\nand Nasdaq listing standards may not have been e\u00a4ective in solving governance problems.\nSeveral observers identify excessive director independence as a problem. In addition, many\nargue that bank executives received too much performance pay which led them to undertake\nstrategies that were too risky. As a result, the OECD has launched an action plan to ad-\ndress weaknesses in corporate governance. Some aspects of this plan seem like steps in the\nright direction, for example, it emphasizes more than one incentive mechanism for CEOs.\n24\nHowever, unless the interactions between incentive mechanisms are taken into account, it is\nunlikely to solve all the problems it hopes to address.\n6 Appendix\n6.1 Proofs\nProof. (Proposition 1) Since P (s = \u0012) = q + (1\u0000 q) p < 1; q\nP (s=\u0012)\n> q (and (1\u0000q)p\nP (s=\u0012)\n=\n1\u0000 q\nP (s=\u0012)\n< 1\u0000 q). Therefore\n\u000b (s = \u0012) =\nq\nP (s = \u0012)\n\u000bH +\n(1\u0000 q) p\nP (s = \u0012)\n\u000bL\ngives more weight to \u000bH than \u000b does, which implies that \u000b (s = \u0012) > \u000b > \u000b (s 6= \u0012) = \u000bL.\nTherefore the board will retain the CEO if and only if it learns that he is of high ability or\nthe CEO\u0092s signal matches its own signal, i.e. s = \u0012:\nProof. (Proposition 2) Assume \u0014b > wN . Let \u0019 \u0014 \u00190 and let s0 2 argmaxR (s). By\nAssumption 1, we know that R (s0) > 0. A CEO who receives a signal s0 chooses to reveal his\ninformation if (assuming that the board assigns equal probabilities to both types whenever\nthe CEO does not reveal his information):\nwR (s0) \u0015 \u0019 (\u0014b\u0000 wN) :\nBut this condition holds in this case from \u0019 \u0014 \u00190. Therefore, the CEO will reveal his\ninformation if s = s0. Consider now a CEO of type s00 6= s0 and suppose that he chooses not\nreveal his signal. The board, however, knowing that if the CEO had a signal s0 he would\nhave chosen to reveal, correctly infers that s = s00. This makes the CEO indi\u00a4erent between\nrevealing or not revealing his information when s = s00. Since we assume that ties are broken\nin favor of revealing, we conclude that the CEO will choose to reveal his information when\ns = s00 as well.\nNow let \u0019 > \u00190. In this case, both types of CEOs (\u0012G or \u0012B) prefer not to reveal their\ninformation, so this is an equilibrium.20\n20 There may exist other perfect Bayesian equilibria in this case, ones in which both types reveal their\ninformation, and when a deviation occurs and the CEO does not reveal his type, the board believes that one\nof the types (either \u0012B or \u0012G) is more likely to be the one deviating, and assigns di\u00a4erent probabilities to\neach type after a deviation. We argue that these equilibria are unreasonable, for they require that the CEO\u0092s\n25\nIf \u0014b \u0014 wN , then pooling (non-revealing) equilibria do not exist, because the expected\ngain from revealing when your type is \u0012s is\nwR (s) + \u0019 (wN \u0000 \u0014b) \u0015 0\nwith strict inequality for at least one of the types. If both types reveal their information,\nthis is trivially an equilibrium.\nProof. (Proposition 3) Let \u0019f be such that\nM (s)\u0000 \u000b = d0 \u0000\u0019f\u0001 :\n\u0019f is well-de\u0085ned because M (s) \u0000 \u000b > 0 and we assumed that d (:) satis\u0085es certain\nregularity conditions.\nSuppose \u0085rst that \u0019f \u0014 \u00190. If the board chooses \u0019\u0003 = \u0019f , then by Proposition 2 the\nCEO will choose to share his information. When there is information sharing, advising\nis optimal and expected \u0085rst-period output is therefore maximized. But since \u0019f is the\nunconstrained best choice of monitoring for the board, second-period output (which depends\nonly on monitoring) is at its \u0085rst-best level. This is the equilibrium in item 1.\nSuppose now that \u0019f > \u00190. Now, the \u0085rst-best cannot be achieved anymore. If the board\nwants to induce revelation, it will choose \u0019\u0003 = \u00190. Otherwise, it will choose \u0019\u0003 = \u0019n where\n\u0019n is such that\nM (;)\u0000 \u000b = d0 (\u0019n) :\n\u0019n is well-de\u0085ned because M (;)\u0000 \u000b > 0. The board will prefer choosing \u0019\u0003 = \u00190 if\nE [y1 j m = s] + \u00190M (s) + (1\u0000 \u00190)\u000b\u0000 d (\u00190)\n\u0015 E [y1 j m = ;] + \u0019nM (;) + (1\u0000 \u0019n)\u000b\u0000 d (\u0019n)\nand will choose \u0019\u0003 = \u0019n otherwise. If it chooses \u0019\u0003 = \u00190, Proposition 2 implies that the\nCEO will share his information m (s; \u0019\u0003) = s. First-period output is maximized because the\nboard learns the CEO\u0092s information, but second-period output is not \u0085rst-best because there\nis too little monitoring: \u0019\u0003 < \u0019f . This is the equilibrium in item 2.\n\u0093right to remain silent\u0094signals his information even though both types have incentives not to reveal. This\ncase is analogous to the right-to-silence game analyzed in Farrell and Rabin (1996). Instead of remaining\nsilent, the CEO could say \u0093you should not try to infer my information from the fact that I am not talking\nto you, because it is in my own interest not to reveal my information to you no matter what it is.\u0094This\nmessage, if believed, is credible. Assuming a rich common language (Farrell, 1993), these equilibria should\nbe ruled out because they are not neologism-proof.\n26\nIf the board chooses \u0019\u0003 = \u0019n, Proposition 2 implies that the CEO will not share his\ninformation m (s; \u0019\u0003) = ;. Expected \u0085rst-period output is not maximized because the board\ndoes not learn the CEO\u0092s information, second-period output is also not \u0085rst-best because\nthe gains from monitoring are lower when there is no information sharing: M (;) < M (s).\nThis is the equilibrium in item 3.\nProof. (Proposition 4) Since \u00190(w) is a strictly increasing function of w, \u00190(0) = 0\nand \u0019f does not depend on w, there exists a unique wf such that \u00190(wf ) = \u0019f . Since for all\nw \u0015 wf , \u00190(w) \u0015 \u0019f the board will implement the \u0085rst best level of monitoring by choosing\nto monitor with intensity \u0019f in this region by proposition 3 For all w < wf , the \u0085rst-best\ncannot be implemented anymore. Now consider the board\u0092s expected utility when \u0019 = \u00190\nand the CEO reveals. The derivative of the board\u0092s expected utility with respect to w is:\n@EUB\n@w\n= [M(s)\u0000 \u000b\u0000 d0 (\u00190)] @\u0019\n0\n@w\n:\nSince \u0019f was chosen to satisfy M (s) \u0000 \u000b \u0000 d0 \u0000\u0019f\u0001 = 0 and d0 (\u0019) > 0; we have for\nall w < wf that M(s) \u0000 \u000b \u0000 d0 (\u00190) > 0. Since @\u00190\n@w\n> 0, the board\u0092s expected utility is\nstrictly increasing in w. Since the board\u0092s expected utility when the CEO does not reveal is\nindependent of w, there exists a unique wn < wf , such that for all wf \u0015 w \u0015 wn the board\nchooses to induce revelation by monitoring with intensity \u00190 and for all w < wn the board\nchooses to monitor with intensity \u0019n.21 Now suppose that w = bw is such that \u0019n = \u00190.\nIn this case the board\u0092s expected utility is strictly greater when the CEO reveals, thereforebw > wn and there is a discontinuity in the board\u0092s strategy since at wn, \u0019n > \u00190.\nProof. (Proposition 5)The proof is analogous to the proof for the CEO\u0092s shareholdings\nexcept that \u00190(b) is strictly decreasing in b and lim\nb!wN\n\u0014\n+\n\u00190(b) =1, so there exists a unique bf\nsuch that \u00190(bf ) = \u0019f and the board can implement the \u0085rst-best monitoring probability \u0019f\nfor all b \u0014 bf . Since for all b > bf , M(s)\u0000 \u000b\u0000 d0 (\u00190) > 0 but @\u00190\n@b\n< 0, the board\u0092s expected\nutility is strictly decreasing in b in this region. Since the board\u0092s expected utility when the\nmanager does not reveal is independent of b, there exists a unique bn > bf ,such that for all\nbf \u0014 b \u0014 bn the board chooses to induce revelation by monitoring with intensity \u00190 and for\nall b > bn the board chooses to monitor with intensity \u0019n. Now suppose that b = bb is such\nthat \u0019n = \u00190. In this case the board\u0092s expected utility is strictly greater when the manager\n21 We are assuming here that when w = 0 and the board chooses to induce revelation by monitoring at\nintensity \u00190 = 0; the board\u0092s expected utility is smaller than when the CEO does not reveal and the board\nmonitors at \u0019n. If not, wn > 0 does not exist but the remainder of the proposition still holds.\n27\nreveals, therefore bb < bn and there is a discontinuity in the board\u0092s strategy since at bn,\n\u0019n > \u00190.\nReferences\nAdams, R., \u0093What do Boards do?

Data are for fiscal year 1998. Financial data are from Compustat. The number of \nbusiness segments is equal to the number of 2-digit SIC codes segments the firm operates in. Leverage=long-term \ndebt\/book assets. Data on year of incorporation were taken from Moody\u2019s Manuals. Governance characteristics \nwere collected from proxy statements for the 1999 proxy season. These proxies contain data on governance \ncharacteristics during fiscal 1998. CEO=COB is a dummy indicating whether the CEO is the chairman of the \nboard (yes=1). CEO tenure as director is the number of years the CEO has been on the board. CEO ownership is \ntotal cash flow rights in units of the company\u2019s traded common stock not counting options exercisable within 60 \ndays. Some CEOs only hold shares in a different class of stock; those CEOs have zero common shareholdings. \nBoard size is the number of directors sitting on the board at the beginning of fiscal 1998, which we calculate as \nthe number of directors standing for election in 1999, plus the number that left the board, minus the number \nthat was added during the year. The board size variable excludes advisory directors and director emeriti. We \ndefine outsiders to be all directors except those currently employed by the company. The estimate of number of \ndirector meeting units spent on the work of a committee is the number of directors on the committee times the \nnumber of regular meetings of that committee during fiscal 1998. Total meeting units spent on committee work \nare the sum of all meeting units spent on individual committees. Total meeting units are the sum of total \nmeeting units spent on committee work and the meeting units spent on board work (=board size times number of \nregular board meetings). We define the number of meeting units devoted to monitoring duties to be the sum of \nmeeting units devoted to the compensation, audit, corporate governance, nominating, non-managing director, \nsuccession and stock option committees. The number of observations varies because of missing data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVariable Obs.

CEO=COB is a \ndummy indicating whether the CEO is the chairman of the board (yes=1) as a proxy for CEO career concerns. \nLikewise, CEO tenure as director (=number of years the CEO has been on the board) is a proxy for CEO tenure \nin the firm and therefore a proxy for CEO career concerns. CEO tenure is measured in decades. CEO ownership \nis a proxy for the CEO\u2019s incentive alignment. CEO ownership is measured as a fraction of total shares \noutstanding.
