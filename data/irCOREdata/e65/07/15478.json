Constructions of \nexternal threats and interests were contested between a largely realist-minded elite around prime \nminister Koizumi bent on Japan\u2018s re-militarization and those still holding to anti-militarist norms. \nThis contest is traced in an analysis of the policy-making process, including the role of bureaucratic \nand political institutions, the opposition parties and the public. Indicative of the power of norms, \nKoizumi was forced to compromise his ambition to use the Iraq crisis to help make Japan a \u2017normal\u2018 \ngreat power.  \n  \n  \n This article examines Japan\u2018s policy in the Iraq war, with the aim of using IR theory \nto illuminate the case and of drawing some lessons from the case relevant to debates over \nforeign policy making.  \n \nTHEORETICAL DEBATES \n  \nOne of the main debates in IR is between the \u2017neo-utilitarians\u2018 (e.g. realists) and \nconstructivists over how far norms, as opposed to material, systemic factors drive foreign \npolicy decisions (Ruggie, 1999).  Realist scholars see a world in which states face objective \nthreats: thus, Chinese power, Korean missiles, and Japan\u2018s energy and security vulnerabilities \nare objective factors that can harm or constrain Japan and to which policy-makers must \nrespond. Realists expect states to respond to the systemic environment by relatively similar \n 2 \nstrategies of power-balancing, with variations a function of level of threat and a state\u2018s power \nposition. For them, Japan\u2018s non-military strategy is a temporary anomaly and, as its economic \ncapabilities and interests have expanded, Japan is seen to be acquiring enhanced military \ncapabilities. Particularly in the post-Gulf war (1990-91) period, Japan became increasingly \n\u2017proactive\u2018 and prepared to use its military instruments in international crises (Green, 2001; \nIwamoto and Edirippulige, 2001; Katzenstein, 2002; Yachi, 2002; Lind, 2004). For realists, \nJapan is in the process of becoming a \u2015normal\u2016 great power. \n For constructivists, however, this is not inevitable: states\u2018 perceptions of external \nthreats are a function of contingent historically constructed enmities while identity and norms \ndetermine what aims and methods (e.g. realist or liberal) are thought appropriate responses. \nFor them, Japan\u2018s distinct anti-militarist national security culture explains its deviation from \nconventional \u2015realist\u2016 behavior (Berger, 1996); its eschewing of a military great power role \ncommensurate with its economic capabilities is attributed to distinctive anti-militarist norms \ngenerated by the Second World War experience of the cost of militarism and institutionalized \nin its \u2015Peace Constitution\u2016 (Katzenstein, 1996: 3) Against realist expectations, Japan\u2018s \nforeign policy remained \u2017reactive,\u2018 \u2017passive,\u2018 and  \u2017low-risk,\u2018 long after the norm-shaping \nexperience and despite great changes in its potential power position (Drifte,1990; Curtis, \n1993; Yasutomo, 1995; Hook, 1996; Heginbotham and Samuels, 1998).   \n Examining the mechanisms said to explain states\u2018 adaptations to the international \nsystem gives some leverage over this debate. For neo-realist Kenneth Waltz (1979), states are \nsocialized into the realist rules of an anarchic system by the high costs of defying them and \nby emulation of successful realist states. Yet, it is neither self-evident that Japan\u2018s strategy as \na trading state has failed nor that the more militarist American approach is so successful that \nit should be emulated; indeed, Japanese policy makers have until recently seemed to agree \nwith Wendt (1992) that anarchy is what states make of it and that through their non-\n 3 \nmilitaristic behaviour they can deter its construction in a malign Hobbesian way. Rose\u2018s \n(1998) neo-classical realism explains lags in adaptation by domestic factors such as elite \nfailures to perceive threats correctly and\/or the lack of institutions to mobilize a country\u2018s \npower potential; but these variables must themselves be explained by domestic political \nculture. Both explanations point to interpretations of the external environment by domestic \nactors, thereby opening the door to the constructivist argument that the distinctive norms and \nidentity of individual states shape their responses to systemic factors. Adaptation in \nbehaviour depends on adaptation in norms.   \n What, then, determines norm change or persistence, particularly in the Japanese case? \nA primary constructivist pathway to norm change is a state\u2018s adoption of system-level norms \nin order to be accepted as a legitimate world player. Japan\u2018s vulnerability, as a result of its \npost WWII experience and subsequent security dependency, to US normative pressures to \nassume military responsibilities can be seen in the way the Japanese elite was seared by US \nadmonitions that they had responded \u2015too little too late\u2016 to the 1991 Gulf war. Such external \npressure is, however, chiefly applied to elites who must still transmit the new norms, if they \nabsorb them, to their own societies; however since, as Katzenstein (1996) argues, domestic \nnorms are denser than those at the international level, the former may prove very resistant to \nchange. This exposes how far Wendt\u2018s notion of the state as a corporative entity sharing \ncollective norms is inappropriate in periods of change when multiple norms are contested \namong elites and between elites and publics (Zehfuss, 2006). In this contest, Putnam\u2018s (1988) \nidea of Janus-faced elites negotiating between the outside and the inside is relevant, \nespecially as adapted by Finnemore and Sikkink (1999), who see domestic political \nentrepreneurs using dominant international norms to shift the identity of their own states.  \n Foreign policy analysis is essential to take the argument further since the structures \nand processes of foreign policy-making are the site of such norm contestation. When norms \n 4 \nconflict, which ones prevail is a function of the power struggle inside regimes and the policy-\nmaking process that channels it. The role of norms in the foreign policy process has several \ndimensions: \n 1) Leaders whose policies diverge from dominant norms must normatively legitimize \nthem or face constraints and high costs (Reus-Smith, 2002); 2) Leaders must carry state \ninstitutions with them but other office-holders may have their own views. The bureaucratic \npolitics paradigm in which policy is affected by competition between different branches of \nthe bureaucracy whose views are shaped by the special interests and jurisdictions of their \noffices can be extended to wider political institutions; moreover, the contest is best seen to be \nconducted by normative discourse over the goals appropriate to a country\u2018s identity and the \nmeans compatible with its norms; 3) The distribution of power in the policy process can be \naltered in several ways. First, institutional and legal change may empower certain office-\nholders and weaken others. Second, when dominant national norms are at stake, the scope of \nconflict may widen and actors be differentially empowered or constrained by the \nmobilization of the public around normative issues.   \n This analysis of Japan\u2018s role in the Iraq war will depart from and explore the \nfollowing assumptions: 1) policy-makers must respond to material systemic factors but that \nresponses vary by state identity which shapes conceptions of interest; 2) there is no single \nfixed national interest and in times of change, it becomes an object of internal contestation, \nwith the balance of institutional power and competitive normative discourse determining \nwhich view prevails. More particularly, the study will show that while top policy-makers \naround Prime Minister Koizumi saw the war as an opportunity to advance their realist \ninterpretation of the world and of Japan\u2018s national interest, they faced significant constraints \nin operationalizing their policy from deep-rooted anti-militarist norms.  \n \n 5 \nJAPAN BETWEEN REALIST ELITES AND ANTI-MILITARIST NORMS \n  \n The Iraq war coincided with a Japanese government of exceptional political strength. \nWhile even association with an unprovoked war against a state that posed no threat to Japan \nand which lacked UN endorsement would seem to be highly problematic on normative \ngrounds, the Koizumi administration, far from simply responding to US pressures for \ninvolvement, saw the war as a major opportunity to serve what it took to be vital national \ninterests.\ni\n Japan\u2018s policy included a statement of clear political support for the US invasion; \ndiplomatic efforts to get support from UN Security Council member states for a resolution to \nendorse the war and another for post-war reconstruction; and the passage of special \nlegislation, the Iraqi Special Law in July 2003, to enable the dispatch of the Japanese Self \nDefense Forces (SDF) to Iraq. Japanese ground troops were deployed in Samawah, a city in \nsouthern Iraq to render reconstruction assistance, and Maritime and Air SDFs undertook \ntransport and fuelling operations in support of the US-led coalition. Japan also hosted a post-\nwar international conference on Iraq reconstruction in October 2003 in which it pledged US$ \n5 billion (US$1.5 billion in grant and US$3.5 billion in loan), the largest amount of financial \nassistance after the US and nearly 10% of the sum called for by the US from donor states. \n Japanese policy-makers believed this policy would enhance the nation\u2018s power \nposition and military security, as realists would expect. They aimed to use the crisis to \nreinforce the US alliance, on which they believed Japan\u2018s security in East Asia to depend in \nthe face of rising Chinese power and a North Korean nuclear threat. It was also an \nopportunity to recover the stake in Iraq\u2018s oil fields they had been forced to relinquish after the \n1990-91 Gulf war, and hence contribute to Japan\u2018s energy security, so dependent on Middle \nEast oil. They believed it would demonstrate international leadership and gain the \ninternational respect as a great power that the Japanese elite craves while redressing the \n 6 \ninternational contempt they suffered for their failure to make a military contribution to the \n1990-91 Gulf war. And, perhaps most important, by enabling the deployment of the SDF, the \ncrisis was expected to help reshape national norms in a way more favorable to Japan\u2018s re-\nmilitarization and hence mark a major step in redressing its lopsided strategic profile as an \neconomic giant without commensurate military capabilities and hence global political clout.  \n All of these aims reflected a sea-change in norms at the elite level, with Japan\u2018s \nleaders seeking now to be a \u2017normal\u2018 great power rather than a non-military great power or \nmere trading state. Although fully explaining this norm shift is beyond the scope of this \npaper, it was in great part the result of rising US global hegemony; the embrace by a new \ngeneration of Japanese elite of US-promoted \u2017realism;\u2018 their fear of abandonment by the US \nin the face of perceived new threats in East Asia, and the deeply ingrained norm among them \nof priority to the US alliance.\nii\n  \nHowever, this new \u2015realist\u2016 view was strongest among top policy makers around \nPrime Minister Koizumi, in his Cabinet Office and in the senior ranks of the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs and was much less embraced outside this top policy-making circle. Japan had \nbecome sharply divided over the relevance of the old anti-militarist norms between the new \nrealists and the older generation within the ruling party, opposition politicians and the public \nmajority, which continue to hold, to varying extent, to anti-militarist norms. Involvement in \nthe Iraq war was highly controversial in that it seemed to challenge national norms and hence \nrapidly mobilized opposition, even in policy-making circles.  \n The outcome was affected by alterations in the balance of power in the policy process. \nTraditionally, Japanese policy-making was made by consensus within a broad but cohesive \nelite made up of senior bureaucrats, ruling party officials, and the leaders of the business \ncommunity (Kusano, 2001: 65-7). This was consistent with a cautious, incremental and \nreactive foreign policy. However, power in Japan had been increasingly centralized (Nakano, \n 7 \n1997), with the weakening of LDP party factions and strengthening of the prime minister\u2018s \noffice, accompanied by a decline of the old consensus politics. The Koizumi administration \n(2001-2006) was a period of exceptional power concentration in the hands of the prime \nminister and his Cabinet Office. Under the central administrative reforms of January 2001, \npolicy-making in an international crisis was centralized in their hands, enabling the prime \nminister to take decisions without seeking a consensus. This \u2017top-down\u2018 policy process was \ndeliberately designed to by-pass the bottom-up bureaucratic and consensual policy process \nthat had delayed Japan\u2018s contributions to the 1990-1 Gulf war, at great cost, in the elites\u2018 \nview, to its international prestige and value as an ally of the US. Additionally, the \ngovernment benefited from an exceptionally popular prime minister, the electoral dominance \nof the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and historic weakness of the opposition parties which \nconstrained the ability of opponents of the Iraq war to mobilize popular normative \nopposition. (Shinoda, 2004, 2007; Muramatsu, 2004, 2005a, 2005b; Furukawa, 2005; \nTakahashi, 2003).   \n Additionally, the government exploited US pressure to overcome resistance to its \npolicy. US demands for Japan\u2018s military participation in the war in Iraq helped Koizumi to \nput his policy preferences on the agenda, while contact with US counterparts, either in the \nform of visits of US leaders or bilateral meetings of high-ranking officials, determined the \ntiming of specific decisions or spurred policy implementation against the inertia or even \nresistance in the bureaucratic process. Thus, the decisions on SDF participation in Iraq and \nfinancial contributions to Iraq reconstruction were both responses to specific requests by US \nUnder-secretary of State Armitage.\n \nCabinet approval of SDF deployment in December 2003 \nwas a response to the visit of US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to Tokyo in November \n2003 and the subsequent US expressions of anger at the delay (Yomiuri Shinbun Seijibu, \n2006: 171-2).   \n 8 \n Thus, the prime minister was empowered to push his policy preferences in the Iraq \nwar and to use participation in the war to erode anti-militarist norms. But he still had to \nstruggle to impose his preferences against the wider circles excluded from decision-making. \nMoreover, the policy-making process still gave sufficient weight to anti-militarist norms, by \nwhich decision-makers were constrained and opponents of the war empowered, that the \nKoizumi administration had to substantially compromise its original ambitions.   \n \nTHE POLICY-MAKING PROCESS IN THE IRAQ WAR \nThe inner policy-making circle \nThe Prime Minister and the Cabinet Office (Naikaku Kanb\u014d):  (C Head) \nThe prime minister made the key decisions on Japan\u2018s policy toward the war. Determined to \nshow support for the US quickly and willingly rather than under pressure, he decided on early \nsupport for the US military attack on Iraq when even high pro-US officials in the Ministry of \nForeign Affairs (MOFA) could not reach an agreement. He decided on deployment of the \nSDF to Iraq. He also decided to carry the burden of 10 per cent of the international financial \ncontribution to Iraqi reconstruction that the US called for, despite the preferences of the \nMinistry of Finance. It was also his idea to seek US cooperation in getting UN endorsement \nof the war in order to facilitate Japan\u2018s involvement (Yomiuri Shinbun Seijibu, 2006: 152, \n159-60, 168). The prime minister personally believed that the Japanese military should \nrecover its role through a revision of the Constitution\u2018s Article 9 (Tachinana, 2003: 34) and \nhoped the Iraq war would facilitate this.  \n Koizumi\u2018s exceptional personal popularity, with approval ratings as high as 78 per \ncent compared to the more usual prime minister ratings of around 20%, combined with the \npowers of his office, made him by far the single most powerful policy-maker. Within the \nCabinet, the prime minister had a firm grip on his Cabinet colleagues.\niii\n Crucially, his \n 9 \nexceptional personal public stature allowed him to include in the cabinet only his trusted \nfollowers and to ignore the traditional practice of giving representation to the LDP\u2018s factional \nbalance (Shinoda, 2004:105-7; Shinoda, 2007: 118-21).  Koizumi's leadership was also \nstrengthened by the fact that the Foreign Minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, having been chosen \nfrom outside inner political circles, lacked an independent power base and had to consult with \nthe prime minister on every detail. Also, the Director-General of the Cabinet Office, Yasuo \nFukuda, acted on behalf of the prime minister, shared his views and had a significant degree \nof control over when and how to implement his key decisions, such as when to send the SDF \nto Iraq (Akasaka, 2004: 225). The prime minister\u2018s dominance within the cabinet was by no \nmeans the norm, and contrasts, for example, with the ability of a independent-minded cabinet \ndirector general to block the wish of a former, also activist-minded pro-US prime minister, \nYasuhiro Nakasone, to comply with a US request that Japan send mine-sweepers to the \nPersian Gulf in the 1980s.  \n  \nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) (Gaimu sh\u014d): (C Head) \nThe main partner of the Cabinet Office in policy-making on Iraq was MOFA. Besides its \nbureaucratic jurisdiction over foreign relations, senior MOFA officials carried exceptional \ninfluence with the prime minister because he had taken office lacking familiarity with foreign \naffairs. Moreover, the Cabinet Office worked closely with top MOFA officials and greatly \nrelied on their views and interpretations of Iraq issues and of Japan\u2018s interests (Kan, 14 \nMarch 2003).  \n The policy-making structure within MOFA also took on a top-down pattern, \nfollowing a new structure that took effect in cases of international crisis in order to speed up \ndecision-making. Policy-making over Iraq was therefore dominated by the highest-ranked \nMOFA officials, who are disproportionately recruited from US specialists or diplomats who \n 10 \nhave served in America and who tend to prioritize the US alliance over all other interests. \nMost involved in the Iraq case were the North American Affairs Bureau and the Foreign \nPolicy Bureau\u2018s Division of General Affairs, which were among the most enthusiastic about \nmeeting US demands. By contrast, the Middle East and African Affairs Bureau (MEAB: \nCh\u016bt\u014d Afurika kyoku), which deals with and has knowledge of the Middle East through the \nembassies posted in Middle East states, as well as functional sections such as the UN Policy \nDivision (Kokuren Seisaku ka), were more skeptical about bandwagoning with the US but \nthey were excluded from Iraq war policy-making. MOFA officials outside the senior ranks \nwere even denied information on aspects of Japan\u2018s policy, which was known to be highly \ncontroversial (Yamatani, 2005: 24; Amaki, 2003: 21, 27, 29, 173-74). This suggests that the \nmerits of the war carried far less weight in the policy process than the perceived needs of the \nUS alliance.  \n In their interactions with the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office, MOFA\u2018s top ranks \nadvocated proactive co-operation with the US and SDF participation in Iraq. They were \nespecially active in lobbying in the war\u2018s aftermath for a quick dispatch of the SDF while \nIraq was still under US occupation for fear that the UN might take over and Japan would lose \nthe opportunity to show its commitment to the US alliance (Okamoto, 2003: 19). In this one \nrespect, however, the prime minister proved more cautious. On the visit of the US Defense \nSecretary Rumsfeld in November 2003 to encourage the SDF dispatch within the year, \nMOFA officials attempted to force Koizumi\u2018s commitment by including the prime minister\u2018s \npledge in his script for the meeting, but Koizumi ignored it (Kasumigaseki Konfidensharu, \nJanuary 2004: 235). Contrary to their preference, SDF activities were reduced from what was \noriginally planned and the SDF dispatch was further delayed as the prime minister attempted \nto appease opposition to the move. \n   \n 11 \nThe intermediate policy-making circle \nIn the intermediate policy-making circle, which enjoyed access to the dominant policy-\nmakers, were the bureaucratic branches relevant to the issue, including the Japan Defense \nAgency (JDA) and the Self Defense Force (SDF), the key economic ministries, the leadership \nof the ruling coalition parties and the leaders of the business community. The majority of \nthem agreed on the basic position of support of the US and of SDF participation in Iraq, but \ntheir views on the degree and the manner in which these policies should be pursued varied.\n  \nCabinet Legislation Bureau (CLB) (Naikaku H\u014dsei kyoku): (C Head) \nThe Cabinet Legislation Bureau (CLB), positioned above the bureaucratic branches, was \nsupposed to be the guardian of national norms in policy-making, charged with ensuring the \nconstitutionality of draft legislation before its submission to parliament. In this capacity, it \nhad to certify the constitutionality of legislation enabling the planned SDF participation in \nIraq. It was therefore pivotal in shaping the form of Japan\u2018s participation. The perimeters of \nthe debate were set by the fact that \u2017collective security,\u2018 meaning participation of Japanese \nforces abroad in UN peace-keeping had, since the 1990 Gulf war, come to be accepted as \nconstitutional, while the use of force in \u2017collective defense,\u2018 meaning SDF participation in a \npurely US-led coalition, was still considered to be prohibited or at least highly controversial. \nWhile a UN resolution had legitimized participation in re-construction activities in Iraq, the \ncountry was in practice under US control and the SDF would in key respects be operating \nunder it; it was, hence, unclear how far the SDF could assume an active military role. The \nCLB\u2018s attempt to accommodate the government by flexible interpretation of the constitution \nwhile still maintaining constitutional principles led to inconsistency. The CLB took a more \nrestrictive view on the constitutionality of the use of force in \u2017collective defense\u2018 than the \npermissive reinterpretations promoted by MOFA and JDA and only approved legislation on \n 12 \nSDF deployment in Iraq on the condition that its activities be restricted to \u2017non-combat areas\u2018 \n(hi sent\u014d chiiki). However, this was eccentrically defined as areas free from combat between \nentities claiming to represent a state, thus excluding the activities of anti-occupation \ninsurgents in Iraq who, in reality, made Iraq a combat zone. In interpreting the area to which \nthe SDF was going as not \u2017a combat area\u2018 (sent\u014d chiiki), it allowed its dispatch without armed \ncapability beyond that needed for strict self-preservation, hence without the actual ability to \nengage insurgents. As the prime minister decided against investing his political leadership \ncapital in reinterpreting the issue of the use of force in collective defense, the CLB\u2018s weapons \nrestriction went unchallenged. \n  \nJapan Defense Agency (JDA) (B\u014dei ch\u014d): (C head) \nUnder Koizumi, younger leaders with strong views on a greater role for the SDF were \nappointed Directors Generals of the JDA\niv\n and its top permanent officials were also \nenthusiastic about sending the SDF to Iraq. This would please US counterparts, enable \nexpansion in the mission of the SDF and possibly lead to the upgrading of the agency to the \nministerial level\u2014which did actually happen in January 2007. However, compared to MOFA \nand some military activists among the politicians, JDA was more cautious about the \nconditions and the timing of SDF participation, putting greater emphasis on minimizing \ncasualties and wanting better weaponry. However, mainly due to the agency\u2018s structural \ndisadvantage of being at the sub-ministerial level and subordinate to the Cabinet Office, but \nalso in part because the JDA\u2018s director lacked good relations with the head of the Cabinet \nOffice, these concerns were largely ignored. \n JDA lobbying was, however, effective in overcoming the reservations of some \npolitical leaders over sending an Aegis information-processing warship to support the war in \nAfghanistan from the Indian Ocean so over-stretched US forces could concentrate on the Iraq \n 13 \nwar. The JDA favored it because of the little risk and large gains from US appreciation but \nsome politicians in the LDP and its ruling coalition partner, the K\u014dmeit\u014d, were wary about \nthe Aegis\u2018 possible involvement in the constitutionally prohibited \u2017collective defense\u2018 with \nthe US. Exceptionally in matters regarding the Iraq war, Prime Minister Koizumi followed in \nthis case the traditional practice of deferring to ruling coalition party leadership, but JDA and \nSDF officials were successful in getting party leaders\u2018 support for a revision of the Anti-\nTerror Law (first passed in 2001 to enable Japan\u2018s naval participation in support of the war in \nAfghanistan), to authorize dispatch of an Aegis vessel in November 2002. \n  \nSelf-Defense Force (SDF) (Jiei tai): (C head) \nThe Self-Defense Force\u2018s involvement in policy-making was limited to technical matters, \nwith the JDA otherwise representing it (Kasumigaseki Konfidensharu, August 2004: 235). \nSDF officers viewed participation in Iraq as a way to enhance their inferior status in Japanese \npublic life and overcome what they took to be crippling restrictions on Japan\u2018s defense \ncapability. Among some lower-rank SDF officers, there was a feeling of duty, even a heroic \nsense of risking their lives for these goals (Handa, 2004: 39). However, the SDF was far from \nunited over the conditions and timing of deployment. The Maritime Self-Defense Force \n(MSDF), having the closest liaison with the US, was in favor of an early deployment. The \nGround Self-Defense Force (GSDF) was more cautious due to the security risks. Its \nleadership had successfully opposed government desires to deploy it to Afghanistan in 2001, \nbut once some politicians began to complain that there was no reason to have an army that \ncould not be used, the GSDF put its priority on securing proper conditions for deployment in \nIraq (Kasumigaseki Konfidensharu, March 2004: 236). SDF\u2018s top ranks appealed directly to \nleaders of the Cabinet Office and in a Diet session GSDF Chief of Staff Hajime Matsusaki \nappealed for a revision of the restrictions on heavy weaponry for the forces to be deployed to \n 14 \nIraq. But the Cabinet Office ignored this, fearing it could throw doubt on the claim that the \nSDF would be deployed in a non-combat area. It also ordered an overly hasty deployment \nfrom the point of view of military preparations.  \n  \nThe Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) (Jiy\u016b minshu t\u014d or Jimint\u014d): (C Head) \nThe Prime Minister\u2018s extraordinarily (as high as) 78 % popularity rating compared to the \npublic 30% approval of the LDP meant that the party was dependent on his personal \npopularity and therefore lacked much leverage over his government\u2018s policy-making. This \nenabled Koizumi to promote party leaders sharing his pro-US, military activist views, thus \nspeeding up the shift in the power balance within the LDP in this direction.\nv\n By contrast, the \ntraditional mainstream LDP Diet members, who were now marginalized, generally favored a \nmore cautious, self-restrained and moderate activation of the SDF. For the activist group, the \nIraq war was an opportunity to advance their agenda.  \nThe prime minister was not entirely free of intra-party opposition to his Iraq policy. \nThe strongest opposition came from anti-Koizumi factions that were marginalized under his \ngovernment and objected to his bypassing of traditional consensus-building within the LDP \nand his evasion of any discussion of the constitutionality of the government\u2018s war policy \n(Shinoda, 2004: 106-07). Other party members who opposed the policy were not anti-\nKoizumi but opposed sending the SDF to Iraq, fearing the political risk of going against \npublic opinion. However, the Koizumi government was able to use the prime minister\u2018s \npopularity among the electorate to contain this opposition (Takahashi, 2003: 98-9).  In the \nend, only three LDP deputies remained opposed but, indicative of the strong disquiet evoked \nby Koizumi\u2018s policy, these were considerable heavyweights, namely, former LDP Chairman \nand Minister for Home Affairs, Hiromu Nonaka (Hashimoto faction), former LDP Chairman \n 15 \nand Minister for Transportation, Makoto Koga (Horiuchi faction), and former Minister for \nHome Affairs Mamoru Nishida (Hashimoto faction). \nAnother line of disagreement came from the \u2017defense tribe\u2018 of politicians with close \nties to the JDA who shared the view that the GSDF should be deployed with proper \nweaponry, expecting that casualties among the troops were likely under the regulations in \nforce; there was even a voice calling for abandoning GSDF deployment under these \nconditions. But they too were contained by the prime minister\u2018s influence in the party.  \nThe great majority of intra-party opposition was mainly over the details, not the \nsubstance of the Iraq policy, and mostly motivated by concern for the risks to the LDP\u2018s \nelectoral prospects. The prime minister was more of a risk-taker and was ineffectively \nconstrained by the more cautious majority. The government had, of course, to overcome \nopposition by its own Diet members in order to pass the enabling laws needed to act in Iraq. \nIts strategy was to pick off opponents one-by-one through a combination of threat, persuasion \nand cooptation. But, crucially, the government also had to make concessions that constrained \nor reduced the SDF\u2018s mission in Iraq. For example, it had to defer to a demand to remove \nWMD clearance activities from the GSDF\u2018s mission. However, given such concessions, the \nLDP Diet majority provided the enabling legislation the government needed to advance its \noverall policy on Iraq (Ishiba and Ushio, 2004: 102). \n 16 \n  \nThe Coalition Partners: (C Head) \nAt the time of the Iraq war, the Koizumi government depended for its parliamentary majority \nin the upper house on a coalition of the dominant LDP with two smaller parties, the New \nConservative Party (Hoshu shin t\u014d) and the K\u014dmeit\u014d. The overwhelming dominance of the \nLDP was the main source of its ability to co-opt its coalition partners over the war in return \nfor minor concessions.  \n The New Conservative Party, having split from the LDP over factional politics, but \nideologically very similar, was highly supportive of the government\u2018s Iraq policy. After a \ngreat loss of its Diet seats in the November 2003 election, its remnants merged with the LDP, \nincreasing the latter\u2018s representation. On the other hand, the K\u014dmeit\u014d had historically \nrepresented itself as a \u2017party of peace\u2018 based on UN-centrism, anti-militarism and opposition \nto the US alliance. In the case of the Iraq war, however, the party leadership shelved the \nparty\u2018s historic policy. The K\u014dmeit\u014d\u2018s leadership appealed for a non-military solution in Iraq \nbut did not obstruct the government\u2018s planning for military participation. Its opposition to \nsending the Aegis vessel was also withdrawn at the beginning of December 2002. When the \nwar was launched without a UN resolution, it officially criticized the US action while still \naccepting the Japanese government\u2018s support for it. Indeed, it defended the government\u2018s \npolicy by criticizing the Saddam Hussein regime and its supposed WMDs and later argued \nthat the SDF mission was humanitarian.   \nThe K\u014dmeit\u014d leadership successfully rebuffed criticism from the party membership \nand strong protests from its main public support base, the Buddhist religious organization, \nS\u014dkagakkai (Hirano, 2005: 26-7). This was because the party\u2018s electoral support, being based \non religious identity, was relatively secure regardless of party policy. The party leadership\u2018s \nbandwagoning with the LDP was motivated by its urge to remain in power and to survive in \n 17 \nwhat it feared was an emerging two-party system of the LDP and the opposition Democratic \nParty. It had witnessed the collaboration between those two large parties in the passage of the \nAnti-Terror Law in 2001 following the 9\/11 terrorist attacks; it was therefore keen, on the \noccasion of the Iraq war, to show its readiness to collaborate with the LDP in order not to be \nreplaced by the Democratic Party as the LDP\u2018s coalition partner (Shinoda, 2004: 77). The \ngovernment therefore could rely on the K\u014dmeit\u014d in the Diet to support key enabling \nlegislation needed for its Iraq policy.  \nNevertheless, the government had to make some concessions to keep the K\u014dmeit\u014d\u2018s \nsupport. It was necessary to the LDP majority in the House of Councillors and LDP Diet \nmembers were increasingly dependent on its highly-organized voting support for their victory \nin elections under the dual voting system.\nvi\n The K\u014dmeit\u014d\u2018s influence on government policy \ngrew with the October 2002 election, and further in the election a year later. Hence, at the \ntime of the passage of the Iraq Special Law, it was able to strike a bargain with the LDP on \ntax concessions favoring its constituency in return for support of the law. It was also able to \nsecure the exclusion from the SDF mission of the transportation of weapons and ammunition \non the grounds that this constituted a prohibited \u2017use of collective defense\u2018 with the US \ncoalition. The K\u014dmeit\u014d was also able to convince the government to postpone the SDF \ndeployment on the grounds of its negative impact on the up-coming Autumn 2003 elections, \nand to further postpone it until after the K\u014dmeit\u014d party conference of 6 December 2003. \nOverall, the coalition parties supported the government\u2018s basic policy for post-war \nparticipation of the SDF, while diluting the substance of its mission. \n \nThe Economic Ministries: (C Head) \nThe two major economic ministries, the Ministry of Finance (MOF - Zaimu sh\u014d) and the \nMinistry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI - Keizai Sangy\u014d sh\u014d) were historically less \n 18 \npro-US and more protective of Japan\u2018s national interests than MOFA, but they were largely \nmarginalized by Koizumi's jettisoning of consensus-based decision-making. Their \ninvolvement in policy-making over Iraq was limited to matters such as the amount of Japan\u2018s \nfinancial contribution to post-war reconstruction. Initially MOFA preferred to provide US$5 \nbillion to shoulder about 10% of the total amount called for in order to maintain the Japanese \nposition as the world\u2018s leading aid donor, while MOF was proposing a tenth of this. High-\nrank MOFA officials persuaded Prime Minister Koizumi and Cabinet Office Director Fukuda \nto opt for the provision of US$5 billion (Yomiuri Shinbun Seijibu, 2006: 174-5). The \ngovernment originally intended that only US$0.5 billion of this would be a grant (rather than \na loan) but the US objected that the grant should be larger in order to encourage other states \nto be generous. MOFA wanted to accommodate the US. Within MOF, the Budget Bureau \n(Shukei kyoku), the most powerful section within the ministry, wanted the grant minimized \nwhile the International Bureau (Kokusai kyoku) supported MOFA.\nvii\n The decision, finally \nmade jointly by the Cabinet Office and MOFA, raised the grant portion to US$1.5 million \n(Iraku Fukk\u014d ni 10 Oku Doru. 18 September 2003; Washimi, 2004). The Japanese \ngovernment\u2018s earlier reluctance to yield to the US demand to write off the Iraqi debt similarly \nreflected the influence of less pro-US, more domestically-oriented bureaucratic branches, \nMETI and MOF, but, again, they were overridden from above. On the other hand, METI \nrepresented and had been organizing the part of the Japanese business community that was \nenthusiastic about reconstruction contracts in post-war Iraq. It was therefore interested in \nhaving the SDF dispatched as early as possible in order to take an advantageous position in \nseizing business opportunities. However, its influence on the matter proved very limited. \n  \nThe business community (zaikai): (C Head) \n 19 \nBusiness was largely a bystander in the debate over the war, bandwagoning with rather than \nlobbying the Koizumi government (Zaikai, 2005: 50; Sonoda, 2004). Business leaders \ngenerally feared the war would have a negative effect on the Japanese economy by causing \nan oil price rise, a lowering of investment and a reduction of their exports (2003 nen Keizai \nSaisei. 21 January 2003). However, believing that the US decision for war could not be \nreversed by Japan, they focused on how to minimize the negative effect and make use of the \nwar to gain business advantages. \n Japan\u2018s over-grown construction industry saw a great opportunity for re-construction \ncontracts in Iraq. Also keen for opportunities in Iraq were chemical plant builders, the \nfinancial sector, and Japan\u2018s leading general trade companies (Nihon Kensetsugy\u014d Dantai \nReng\u014d kai 2003; Hamada, 2004: 160). The business association, the Keidanren, with the \nparticipation of nearly 70 companies from these industries, had held three meetings with \ngovernment officials from MOFA and METI by Autumn 2003, to discuss post-war \nreconstruction business, the possibility of a share in the Iraqi oil industry and the Iraqi market \nfor Japanese exports (Mori, 2004: 156). In contrast to these sectors, Japanese oil companies \nwere reluctant to enter the Iraqi market, believing investment in Iraq to carry great risks and \nthat the Japanese oil industry lacked the capital to obtain a large contract and would have to \nenter a consortium with a major US or British company.\nviii\n \n Business sectors hoped the war would take place within a UN framework since the \nUN would likely be favorable to the business interests of Japan, its second largest donor \n(IEEJ, 2002: 3). As the military attack was launched without UN support, and it became clear \nthe US would decide the allocation of reconstruction contracts, business leaders started \narguing that it was necessary to gain US favour through early SDF participation in Iraq. \nWhen, after the invasion, the US government started to allocate Iraqi contracts to US \nenterprises, there was impatience among business leaders at the government\u2018s delay in \n 20 \ndeploying the SDF. However, their urging of early deployment proved ineffective in the face \nof government caution (Sakae, 2003; Hamada, 2004). For the government, Japanese business \nopportunities in post-war Iraq were secondary to its strategic goals and domestic popularity.  \n \nThe outer policy-relevant circle \nThe opposition parties: (C Head) \nThe opposition parties strongly opposed the war and were excluded from policy-\nmaking over Iraq. The smaller opposition parties, the Japan Communist Party (JCP, Nihon \nKy\u014dsan t\u014d) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP, Shakai Minshu t\u014d, the former Socialist \nParty), firmly held to Japan\u2019s non-militarist and UN-centrist national norms, standing against \nthe war and against sending the Aegis vessel to the Indian Ocean, for a non-military solution \nto the Iraqi WMD issue within the UN framework, and for the provision of humanitarian and \npost-war reconstruction assistance to Iraq without the use of the SDF. However, the number \nof their Diet seats had declined to the point where the government could ignore them in \nlegislation, hence in the policy-making process. The largest opposition party, the Democratic \nParty of Japan (DPJ, Nihon Minshu t\u014d), stood for a UN-centered policy in opposition to the \ngovernment\u2019s support for the US invasion without a UN resolution. Its condition for post-war \nSDF participation was that there should be a new UN Security Council resolution \nestablishing a UN multilateral force for the purpose of providing reconstruction assistance, \nand that there should be a request from a new Iraqi government.\nix\n The Democratic Party \nrebuffed attempts by the government to co-opt it, believing that, in view of public opposition \nto the war, an independent policy would win it electoral support As a result, the government \ndecided to marginalize the opposition altogether, dismissing all its protests and questioning of \ngovernment policy and relying on the ruling coalition\u2019s majority in the Diet. \n 21 \nThe opposition parties were unable to mobilize the public\u2019s broad opposition to the \nwar to effectively counter the government. To be sure, they jointly submitted a resolution \nagainst the war to the House of Representatives demanding the withdrawal of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s statement of support for the US invasion. They also used delaying tactics against \npassage of the Iraqi Reconstruction Law, submitted motions of no confidence in the \ngovernment and boycotted the vote on ex-post facto approval of the SDF dispatch in late \nJanuary 2004. However their position was weakened by lack of unity. Thus, when the DPJ \nsubmitted on 3 July 2003 an amended bill to the House of Representatives that removed \nauthorization of SDF deployment, the three other opposition parties did not back it since they \nbelieved it did not challenge the legitimacy of the occupation of Iraq. The DPJ itself was \ndivided since its members came from various political parties including both the LDP and the \nformer Socialists. As a result, the opposition parties could not block SDF participation in \nIraq, although the government\u2019s fear not to give them too much ammunition in forthcoming \nelections contributed to the concessions it made to its own parliamentary supporters.  \n \nThe media: (C Head) \nThe two pro-government papers with 55 per cent of the total circulation, Yomiuri Shinbun \nand Sankei Shinbun, systematically promoted the government message that support for US \npolicy was in the national interest by linking the Iraq issue to the North Korean WMD threat. \nMost journalists and the widely-watched privately-owned TV news programs opposed the \nwar and helped maintain a critical atmosphere. But they failed to mobilize the public behind a \nviable alternative to government policy mainly due to their lack of investigative reporting and \nin-depth explanation of the issue and their limiting of the discussion to the terms of Japan\u2018s \nrelationship with the US (Fujita, 2003: 86-94). The critical majority of Middle East experts \nrefrained from open opposition for fear of government retaliation. As a result, the public did \n 22 \nnot receive vital information that would have enabled it to reach an informed opinion. Among \nthe five major newspapers, only the left-center Mainichi Shinbun shed light on the broader \npicture but it had only a 14 per cent share of total circulation. \n \nPublic opinion and national norms: (C Head) \nPolicy-makers saw the Iraq war as an opportunity to further erode the anti-militarist and UN-\ncentrist norms in Japan\u2018s political culture and also to promote a new public appreciation of \nthe US alliance. Public sensitivity to military activism had, over time, already been assuaged \nby policy-makers\u2018 security discourse, which insisted on the importance of Japanese \nparticipation in management of international crises following the 1990-1 Gulf war and had \nbeen invoking the \u2017North Korean threat\u2018 since the late 1990s. Their hope was that new \nprecedents established in the Iraq war, especially SDF participation, would also come to be \npublicly accepted.  \n However traditional norms remained strong enough that the disparity between them \nand Japan\u2018s bandwagoning with the US in the war crisis had to be addressed. To comply with \nthe still strongly held UN-centrist norm, the government sought UN backing for the expected \nUS attack on Iraq. When this failed, the government claimed that twelve-year-old UN \nresolutions, numbers 678 and 687, and Resolution 1441 demanding Iraq disarm but not \nspecifically authorizing an attack on it, were sufficient. The government also sought to \ndisplace UN-centrism with prioritization of the US alliance as a new public norm. However, \nin contrast to the Gulf war of 1991, which was widely seen as a UN-authorized defensive war \nin which Japan had some obligation to participate, US pressures for participation in the \nunprovoked 2003 war were received negatively by the public. The government therefore \nplayed down demands from the US to join the coalition, and argued that strengthening of the \nalliance was in Japan\u2018s own interest in countering the North Korean nuclear threat;x in fact, \n 23 \nthe Asahi polls of November 2002 and March 2003 showed that 73 per cent of respondents \nwere worried about North Korea and 67 per cent took it into consideration in judging the \nPrime Minister\u2018s support for the US war on Iraq (Koizumi Naikaku Shiji. 2002; Iraku K\u014dgeki \n\u2017Fushiji\u2018. 22 March 2003).  \n Overall, however, the Iraq war showed the persisting strength of the anti-militarist \nand UN centric norms among the public. An Asahi poll taken just before the war showed \naround 78 per cent of respondents against the US military attack and around 52 per cent \ndisagreeing with the government\u2018s support for it. Active expression of public opposition \nincluded over 60 local assemblies\u2018 anti-war resolutions, prefectural governors\u2018 protests, a \nlawyers\u2018 lawsuit against the government, a mail and phone-in campaign of protest to the \nPrime Minister\u2018s Office, and a \u2017human shield\u2018 traveling to Iraq.  \n Around 70 per cent of the public also opposed SDF participation in Iraq (Tachibana, \n2004: 29). The prime minister repeatedly asserted that the SDF was not going to Iraq for war \nbut for humanitarian reconstruction. He also promoted a re-interpretation of the Constitution, \nclaiming that the phrase in its Preamble on the \u2017aspiration [of Japan] to occupy an honored \nplace in an international society striving for the preservation of peace\u2018 meant that Japan \nshould gain international respect by sending Japanese troops in support of international peace \n(MOFA, 2003; Kantei, 2004; MOFA, 2004). However this re-interpretation did not win \npublic acceptance, and on the contrary, elicited criticism even from LDP leaders. The high \nlevel of insecurity the SDF would encounter in Iraq added to the public opposition.  \n None of this, however, deterred the government from pursuit of its aims. Koizumi \nopenly insisted the public should not always be heeded since it was wrong in always \npreferring peace to war (Yoron ni Say\u016b sarete Tadashii ka? 5 March 2003; Jidai Banare no \nGaik\u014d. 17 March 2003). To be sure, his popularity dropped dramatically as a result of the war \nbut nevertheless remained above 40 per cent, still a record level of public support for a \n 24 \nJapanese prime minister (Naikaku Shijiritsu. 19 January 2004). Crucial was that while a \nmajority opposed the government\u2018s policies on Iraq, this did not necessarily turn them against \nthe government per se. An opinion poll of 23-4 February 2003 showed that 41 per cent of \nthose opposed to the war nevertheless accepted the government policy, with the majority of \nsuch supporters saying that there was no credible alternative to Koizumi\u2018s leadership. A poll \ntaken four months after the SDF dispatch showed that 73 percent of the respondents still \nfavored the prime minister staying in office (S\u014dsaisen Jimin Shijiritsus\u014d. 10 September 2003; \nShush\u014d Tsuzukete Hoshii. 20 April 2004).  \n Although policy-makers managed to deploy the GSDF, thus setting a precedent for \nenlarging its overseas activities, they had, nevertheless, to scale down their original ambitions \nand to refuse certain US requests. Expected SDF participation in logistical and rear support \nfor the US coalition during wartime proved impossible due to the absence of an endorsing \nUN resolution and planned security maintenance tasks after the war were abandoned either \nbecause the government could not secure enabling legislation from the Diet despite the ruling \ncoalition\u2018s majority or saw domestic political risk in doing so in the face of strong public \nobjections. In the end, the SDF deployment to Iraq for post-war humanitarian and \nreconstruction assistance was purely symbolic, demonstrating political support for the US \nwar but contributing nothing to its military effort. The effect of public opinion on policy-\nmaking although indirect, was powerful: it was the public\u2018s personal support for Prime \nMinister Koizumi that allowed him to advance his agenda and it was public criticism of the \nwar, inspired by anti-militarist norms, that limited its extent.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n Japan\u2018s pro-US military activism in the Iraq war marked a clear departure from its \ntraditional policy. It demonstrated that anti-militarist norms at the elite level had been \n 25 \nthoroughly eroded by \u2017realist factors\u2018 such as US-hegemony and the asymmetric relationship \nbetween the US and Japan, coupled with the absence of zones of peace in East Asia and the \nMiddle East. The Iraq war was also exceptional in the relative ability of policy-makers to \nreinterpret national norms in the pursuit of their agenda. This was possible because of the \nexceptional political strength of the Prime Minister, the LDP near-majority in the Diet, the \nnewly established structure of top-down policy-making, and policy-makers\u2018 recognition that \nthe public\u2018s opposition to the war was not turning it against the Koizumi government.  \n Yet this power centralization in the hands of a \u2017realist\u2018 elite, even combined with US \npressures and perceived threats from without, was not enough to transform Japan into a \nrealist actor. Policy-makers remained constrained by the institutionalization of anti-militarist \nnorms in the constitution and backed by public opinion. The UN-centric norm that Japanese \ninvolvement in military operations had to be within a UN framework forced the leadership to \ninvest much diplomatic effort in trying to secure UN approval and failure to get it excluded \nJapanese participation in the war itself. UN endorsement of Iraq\u2018s post-war reconstruction \nenabled SDF participation in this but the fact that it took place in a de-facto war zone under \nUS control meant constitutional constraints and anti-militarist norms still forced the \ngovernment to so reduce the scope of the SDF mission that it was robbed of most of its \nsubstance.  \n Traditional norms were empowered in the policy process by the role of the Cabinet \nLegislation Bureau in defense of constitutionality; concessions that had to be made to keep \nsupport for government policy within the ruling party, the ruling coalition and the Diet; and \ngovernment fear of negative reaction from public opinion. That despite their power advantage \nthe prime minister and the Cabinet office got only a fraction of what they wanted is evidence \nof the constraining impact of norms on the elite\u2018s ability to operationalize its \u2017realist\u2018 \nworldview.  \n 26 \n To be sure, from a realist viewpoint, Japan is moving toward a \u2015normal\u2016 great power \nin that a dominant part of the policy-making elite has embraced realist norms and increased \nJapan\u2018s military capabilities. The notion of the national interest they embraced was not, \nhowever, self-evident, but issued from an interpretation of the world seen through the prism \nof norms absorbed in good part from the world hegemon but which were contested within \nJapan. The elite\u2018s attempt to use the Iraq war to further promote a realist interpretation of the \nworld faced resistance both from within the political class and from public opinion which, to \nvarying extents, continued to hold to non-realist liberal internationalist and anti-militarist \nviews. Alterations in political institutions, in the distribution of power among agents and in \nthe dominant discourse, had shifted power marginally but not decisively in favour of the \nrealists and their norms.  \n The test of how far the Iraq war episode eroded anti-militarist norms will be whether a \nfuture leader can respond as Koizumi did to a similar US request for Japan\u2018s military \nparticipation in a crisis. So far, neither normative or institutional change appear sufficient \nand, hence, a similar venture would require another exceptionally favourable balance of \nforces in the policy process, that is, a strong Koizumi-like leader backed by an LDP majority. \nIndicative of this is the strong opposition that had to be overcome by the post-Koizumi \nleadership to renewal of the Anti-terrorism Law allowing quite modest support of US naval \noperations in the Indian Ocean.\nxi\n Hence Japan\u2018s reconstruction as a \u2015normal\u2016 great power in \nthe realist mould remains far from complete.  \n The Japanese case exposes, for the broader discipline, the importance of a complex \nmulti-level analysis for a sufficient understanding of state behavior. It underlines the \nimportance of combining attention to agency, exposed by foreign policy analysis, with \nsystemic structure and of material with socially constructed ideational factors, as argued by \nHudson (2005). The system level is, as realists argue, constituted of objective material \n 27 \nfactors\u2014global hegemons, powerful neighbors, economic interdependencies and \nvulnerabilities\u2014that states cannot ignore but whether they are threats or opportunities is \nnever self-evident; rather policy-makers\u2019 interpretation of the external environment is the \nmost important immediate factor shaping in their responses. Their interpretation is affected \nby norm contestation involving both international, often hegemon-promoted, norms and \ndomestic level ones that reflect the historically accumulated experience of the foreign policy \nestablishment and the distinct security culture of a particular society, with elites, Janus-faced, \nnegotiating between the two levels. Against realism\u2019s assumption that analysis can safely \ntake the state as a unitary actor, FPA\u2019s opening of the black box of internal decision-making \nis essential to identify the relative weight and interaction of ideational and material factors. \nThe policy process resembles bureaucratic politics but one in which varying actor interests \nare promoted through competitive normative discourse over conceptions of national interest \nand identity, of the nature of the external environment, and the appropriate (e.g. liberal vs. \nrealist) kinds of response. Neo-classical realism sees lags in states\u2019 \u201crational\u201d adaptation to \nsystemic situations as a function of domestic constraints on or distortions of \u201crealist\u201d \nbehavior; what it fails to acknowledge is that \u201crationality,\u201d itself constructed\u2014and somewhat \ndifferently in different security cultures\u2014need not take a \u201crealist\u201d form. Indeed, realist \nanalysis, in taking the state as a unit, looking only at policy outputs and failing to penetrate \nthe policy process would miss, as it does in the Japanese case, the ambiguities, complexities \nand normative constraints on state behavior.  \n  \n 28 \nREFERENCES \n \nAkasaka, Taro (2004) Fukuda to Fusein ni Sukuwareta Koizumi (Koizumi, who was Rescued \nby Fukuda and Hussein).
