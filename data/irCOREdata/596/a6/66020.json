Sixteen relevant hominid sites lacking chronometric evidence are briefly discussed. \nChronometric evidence from 37 sites is assessed in detail. The dates for many hominid fossils are \npoorly constrained, with a number dated by comparisons of faunal assemblages a method that \ndoes not have good chronological resolution for much of the last million years. For sites with \nstratigraphic sequences of dates, it is generally possible to refine the dating, but in some cases, \nthe revised chronology is less precise than previous chronologies. Fossils over 200 ka in age tend \nto be poorly dated, but for the last 200 ka, dating is better due to the availability of electron-spin-\nresonance and thermoluminescence dating. Consideration of the chronologies favored by the \nproponents of the out-of-Africa and multiregional hypotheses of human evolution shows their \nselectivity. The chronological assessment of the fossils here is compatible with either hypothesis. \nIf evolutionary schemes that do not rely on the morphology of the hominid fossils to decide the \nsequence of fossils are to be built, then further dating is required, alongside full publication of \nexisting dates. \n3 \nIntroduction \nOur understanding of the early evolution of Homo sapiens depends critically on being \nable to define the chronology and ordering of middle and late Pleistocene (ca. 500\u201350 ka) sites \ncontaining hominid fossils and\/or archaeological evidence for \u201cmodern human behavior.\u201d \nAlthough there have been numerous attempts to date (and redate) key sites, the \u201cmost serious \nimpediment to interpretation of the Middle Pleistocene record has been the lack of a sound \nchronological framework\u201d (McBrearty and Brooks, 2000: 487). The provision of a reliable \nchronology is a key component required in the resolution of conflicting theories of modern \nhuman origins and dispersal. Over the last decade, the majority of opinion on the evolution of \nmodern humans has favored the out-of-Africa model of human expansion at ca.100 ka replacing \nearlier hominids, rather than the multiregional model of worldwide evolution with gene flow. \nHowever, debate continues (Cann, 2002; Templeton, 2002; Thorne and Wolpoff, 2003; Br\u00e4uer et \nal., 2004), with the details of both models contested, though there is more extensive debate \nwithin the out-of-Africa school (e.g., McBrearty and Brooks, 2000). Within these debates, some \ndates on fossils are widely accepted (e.g., dates of ca. 100 ka for modern humans in the Levant), \nwhile others are disputed or uncertain so that different authors choose different chronologies to \nsuit their evolutionary schemes. The debates will not be resolved until we have clear knowledge \nof which fossils\u201f dates are and are not well constrained, as well as the reliability of these dates. \nGenetic studies provide some evidence, but are inherently ambiguous in their dating (Cann, \n2002; Templeton, 2002). Other aspects of the study of human evolution, such as brain size and \ncognitive capacity (Aiello and Wheeler, 1995; Mithen, 1996) and the impact of climate change \n(Ambrose, 1998) also rely on being able to date fossils firmly. The crucial importance of dating \nevidence has led to a great deal of effort being expended over the last 20 years in obtaining and \n4 \nimproving chronometric dates for fossils (e.g., Aitken et al., 1993). As dating procedures have \nevolved, it has become clear that some methods are more reliable than others, and all have \nsignificant uncertainties in their estimates. Despite this fact, many authors treat dates uncritically \nor selectively. Some choose \u201cthe most likely ages\u201d (see caption to Figure 1 in Br\u00e4uer et al., 1997) \nor ignore the published uncertainty in chronometric estimates, leading to overinterpretation of \nthe dating evidence. Others ignore known technical problems that suggest certain types of dates \nare unreliable (Millard and Pike, 1999). Even the recent compilation of dates for African \nhominids (see Table 1 in McBrearty and Brooks, 2000) suffers from each of these errors in \nseveral places, despite its greater awareness of the problems than many other papers. Hence, \nthere is a need for the development of a methodology for systematic and coherent evaluation of \ndating evidence, and its application to fossil hominid sites, before dating evidence can be used to \nsupport or refute particular interpretations of human evolution. \nArchaeologists and geologists have recognized for many years that chronometric dates \nand stratigraphic information need to be combined, if only at the level of establishing that the \nordering of samples according to stratigraphy agrees with their ordering by chronometry. The \nlast 15 years have seen the development and application of Bayesian statistics to radiocarbon \ncalibration and chronological modeling as a means to move beyond this level so that the \nstratigraphic (or other) prior chronological information can be used to constrain and inform the \nquantitative estimates of time from chronometric measurements. In general, this approach leads \nto gains in chronological resolution, and fuller statements of uncertainty, due to the use of all \navailable information. Until recently, radiocarbon dates were the only chronometric data that \ncould be incorporated using this methodology (Buck and Millard, 2003).  This paper uses recent \ndevelopments in this methodology that allow luminescence, uranium-series, and electron spin \n5 \nresonance (ESR) dates to be included in stratigraphic analysis, and applies them to test and refine \nthe age estimates for hominid fossils from the period of 500\u201350 ka, within which modern human \nskeletal morphology appears. \n \nMethods \nTwo basic principles underlie the methods used here: \n \n(1) \u201cchronometric hygiene\u201d (Spriggs, 1989) should be applied to all dating techniques \nand samples; \n(2) wherever possible, all chronometric information should be treated within a coherent \nanalytical framework (including statistical analyses) with internally consistent \nassumptions. \n \nChronometric hygiene \nChronometric hygiene seeks to weed out from our collection of dates those that are \nunreliable or unrelated to the question at hand before analyzing the remainder. The idea of \napplying such a sifting process to the dates relating to hominid fossils is not new, as a scheme for \nthe general classification of the reliability of dates and their association with fossils was set out \nby Oakley (1964), and a detailed scheme for critical consideration of radiocarbon dates was \ndescribed by Waterbolk (1971) and more recently by Pettit et al. (2003). The caveats and criteria \nfor reliability of other dating techniques are less explicitly set out in the literature. For the \nmethods considered here, criteria for technical reliability are outlined below, and a more detailed \ndiscussion of critical approaches to assessing the reliability of dates will be found in a \n6 \nforthcoming volume (Bailiff and Millard unpubl. ms.), including indications of what data should \nbe published to allow for a critical assessment and, if required, recalculation of dates based on \ndifferent assumptions. In general, chronometric hygiene assesses the extent to which the samples \nconform to the assumptions of the technique, the consistency of repeated measurements on the \nsame sample, and the consistency of sequences of dates with their stratigraphic order. \nPotassium-argon (K-Ar) and argon-argon (Ar-Ar) dating methods rely on assumptions of \nrelease of Ar during melting of minerals and of initial \n40\nAr content prior to the build up of \nradiogenic \n40\nAr from the decay of \n40\nK. These are critical considerations for both methods, but \nthey are hard to test with K-Ar dating except by consistency within groups of ages, and between \nK-Ar ages and those obtained by other methods. With Ar-Ar dating, however, stepwise heating \nand single-crystal laser-fusion (SCLF) allow the assumptions to be tested, using plateau tests, \nage spectra, and isochrons (McDougall and Harrison, 1988). For the young subaerial samples of \nmost middle and late Pleistocene hominid sites, isochrons should show initial \n40\nAr\/\n39\nAr ratios \nclose to the atmospheric value of 295.5 (Steiger and J\u00e4ger, 1977), and age-spectra or plateau tests \nshould show a strongly reproduced young age with some higher ages if the sample is \nincompletely reset. \nMost Ar-Ar ages considered here are SCLF ages. The methods reported in the literature \nfor assessing the consistency of such dates on the crystals of a single sample are ad hoc and \nvariable. McDougall et al. (2005) rejected outliers that are more than two standard deviations \n(SD) from the mean, iterated until no more analyses were rejected, and then calculated a mean \nage from the remaining analyses. Potts and Deino (1995) also used an iterative process of \neliminating the outliers in an ischron analysis until the scatter was accounted for by analytical \nerror alone. Clark et al. (1994) rejected outliers on the basis of visual inspection of age-\nComment [MSU1]: \u201cIn prep.\u201d should be \nchanged to \u201cunpubl. ms.\u201d \n7 \nprobability spectra to ensure a normal distribution of results. Potts and Deino\u201fs (1995) process is \nan objective one that does not depend on the number of measurements, but McDougall et al.\u201fs \n(2005) method will reject 5% of genuine measurements and, like Clark et al.\u201fs (1994) process, \ndoes not apply a statistical test showing that the dates accepted and averaged follow the expected \nnormal distribution. Within the field of radiocarbon dating, the standard statistical test for \nconsistency, and rejection of outliers before combining ages, is that of Ward and Wilson (1978). \nThis method tests whether the scatter of a set of dates is greater than that expected if they were \nnormally distributed about a true date with the quoted uncertainties as the only source of scatter. \nIf the test is passed, a weighted mean age and uncertainty are calculated. It thus accomplishes \nusing a formal statistical test what researchers using Ar-Ar dating have attempted using informal \napproaches. For this reason, Ward and Wilson\u201fs (1978) method was used in the present study to \nreassess the consistency of SCLF measurements of a single sample and to calculate a weighted \nmean age as the estimate of the age of the sample. For samples failing the test, consideration \nmust be given to alternative methods of calculation. The outlier-elimination method of Ward and \nWilson (1978) was used here to reduce the data set to a coherent group that passes the test, but \nfor one site, Bodo, applying this procedure was problematic, and thus a tailored statistical \napproach was taken, as described below in the discussion of the site. Where there are Ar-Ar dates \nfrom multiple samples considered coeval, the Ward and Wilson (1978) test was also appropriate \nfor testing for consistency. \nElectron spin resonance (ESR), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and, \nthermoluminescence (TL) techniques have a common basis in measuring a signal that increases \nin response to environmental radiation while a sample is buried. They differ in the methods of \nsignal measurement and the mechanism for its initial zeroing, and in the assessment of internal \n8 \nradiation dose. In evaluating the external dose, it is necessary to consider possible \ninhomogeneous radiation fields, especially if elemental analyses of sediment are used without in \nsitu -spectrometer measurements for comparison. Multiple samples from the same stratum, or \neven site, may depend on a few evaluations of external dose, so that statistical analysis is \ncomplicated by correlation of uncertainties; this is often forgotten when dates are being \ncombined or compared (Millard, 2003). In addition, where dating is conducted on museum \nspecimens excavated many years ago, careful consideration must be given to the reconstruction \nof the external dose rate and whether it can be made reliably from small amounts of soil adhering \nto the sample (Mercier et al., 1995). This is true for all three methods, but in practice applies \nmore to ESR dating studies.  \nWhen ESR and luminescence dates on a single stratum were combined in a single \nchronology, the external radiation field will have been the same for all the samples, and thus it \nwas necessary to check that the various dates were computed using the same values of the \nparameters that influence that radiation field (i.e., the radiation emitted by the sediment, the \nwater content that attenuates the radiation, and the dose rate from cosmic rays). Where different \nworkers used different assessments or estimates of these parameters, it was necessary to assess \nthe values used, evaluate the means by which they were reached, and arrive at a common set of \nparameters that could be used to recompute the dates on a common basis. In general, the most \nconservative estimates of their uncertainties were used. \nIt is usually assumed that the uncertainty in water content is normally distributed, but this \ncan lead to negative water contents having nonzero probabilities. As water content is expressed \nas water per dry weight of sediment, a useful approximation is to treat the ratio as lognormally \n9 \ndistributed (Aitchison, 1986). The calculations made here therefore assumed lognormal \ndistributions with the same mean and standard deviation as previously estimated.  \nDates obtained by these dating techniques also rely to a greater or lesser degree on \nconversion factors to calculate dose rates from elemental concentrations. Over the years, these \nhave been revised, and for fine-grained comparisons, it is necessary to recalculate ages using the \nlatest tables of conversion factors. For this study, where possible, the tables of Adamiec and \nAitken (1998) and Brennan and Lyons (1989) were used to recalculate ages, superseding the \ntables of Bell (1979) or Nambi and Aitken (1986), and Valladas (1988) or Zimmerman (1972), \nrespectively. \nThe standard procedure for combining either TL or OSL dates, assuming they date the \nsame event, is that of Aitken (1985: Appendix B), which weights by the uncertainties unique to \neach sample and accounts for uncertainties in common between samples. There are no published \nmethods specifically for combining ESR dates, and the usual approach has been to average a set \nof dates, weighting by their uncertainties, and computing a reduced uncertainty (e.g., Gr\u00fcn and \nBeaumont, 2001). Multiple determinations on one specimen are averaged in the same manner as \ndeterminations on multiple specimens. This approach ignores the fact that a major source of \nuncertainty on all determinations from one specimen, and often on all those from one stratum, is \nfrom their common estimates of external dose rate and the sediment water content. Such \nuncertainties cannot be reduced by averaging. As the structure of the uncertainties is almost \nidentical to that of TL and OSL, the method of Aitken (1985: Appendix B) is more appropriate, \nbut has only occasionally been used. Due to the complexity of the calculation of uncertainty in \nTL, OSL, and ESR dates, no statistical tests have been devised to check the consistency of a set \nof dates presumed to be dating the same event. \n10 \nElectron-spin-resonance dating is usually applied to tooth enamel (Rink, 1997). The \ntechnique relies on the measurement of the ESR signal that increases in teeth in response to \nirradiation. In addition to the external radiation dose, consideration has to be given to the internal \nradiation dose, which varies with the history of uranium uptake into the tooth. As this history is \nunknown, it is common to make alternative calculations for two scenarios: early uptake (EU) and \nlinear uptake (LU), which are regarded as extremes of the range of possibilities, representing \nuptake of uranium immediately after burial (for EU) or steady accumulation of uranium between \nburial and the present (for LU). If a uranium-series date is also measured on the tooth, it can be \nused to check which uptake model is more appropriate or allow for the application of a more \nflexible uptake model such as the US-ESR model (Gr\u00fcn et al., 1988). These more sophisticated \n(and mathematically more complex) uptake models have not yet been adapted for the Bayesian \nstatistical approach described below, so the analyses of this paper used only EU and LU, noting \nwhether these dates differ from published US-ESR dates. In order for reanalysis of dates to take \nplace, a large number of experimental measurements for each sample must be published, and this \nis usually the case (Millard, 2006a). In order to use the most recent conversion factors , all ESR \ndates and their components were also recalculated using ROSY version 2.0 (Brennan et al., \n1999; Kao et al., 2003). Where there was no strong evidence as to whether EU or LU ESR dates \nare more accurate, alternative chronologies are presented for both models. \nOptically stimulated luminescence dating (or simply \u201coptical dating\u201d) relies on the \nremoval of OSL signal by bleaching with sunlight, and the stability of any subsequently acquired \nsignal until laboratory measurement. Chronometric hygiene therefore requires the passing of \ntests for incomplete bleaching or the presence of completely unbleached grains (e.g., Roberts et \nal., 1999) using multiple aliquots of the same sample or measurements on single grains (e.g., \n11 \nJacobs et al., 2003b). The OSL signal of quartz grains is generally believed to be stable on \nPleistocene timescales, but feldspars often suffer from anomalous fading (Roberts, 1997). \nTherefore reliable dates are obtained when only quartz is extracted, or when tests show that any \nfeldspars present do not suffer from anomalous fading. \nThermoluminescence dating is best applied to heated materials, notably burnt flints in \nhominid sites. It is less reliable when applied to unburnt sediments, especially in comparison to \nOSL, due to the greater chance of incomplete bleaching of the TL signal and greater difficulty of \ndetecting this (Spooner, 1998). The older the material to be dated, the greater the need to check \nfor the onset of saturation of the TL signal, especially as dating moves into the hundreds of \nkiloannum range. \nUranium-series (U-series) dating is applicable to a range of calcareous materials. It \nassumes that uranium is present initially without its radioactive decay products (thorium and \nprotactinium) and that no uranium is subsequently lost or gained except by radioactive decay. \nThe build up of the decay products can thus be used to calculate the age of the material. For \nspeleothems, pure calcitic material is preferable, but \u201cdirty\u201d calcites can be dated if account is \ntaken of the initial presence of detrital thorium using a suitable method such as an isochron plot \n(Ludwig and Titterington, 1994). Bones and teeth have frequently been dated, but it is now clear \nthat they take up uranium continuously and checks on the uranium-uptake history are essential \n(Millard and Pike, 1999), and methods should be used that allow modeling of that history \n(Millard and Hedges, 1996; Pike et al., 2002). In comparison with other dating techniques, the \nmajority of U-series dates on bones are underestimates (Millard, 1993: 29). Mollusc shells \nsimilarly suffer from unknown uptake histories, and there are fewer methods to control for them \nthan with bone. Uranium-series dates on molluscs are therefore suspect, and as stratigraphic \n12 \nconsistency within a site is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for reliability, they are useless \nfor constructing chronologies, as it cannot be determined whether they over- or underestimate the \ntrue age. Thus, chronometric hygiene requires all U-series dates on molluscs to be rejected and \nthose on bone to be treated as suspect and likely to be underestimates unless there is a clear \nunderstanding of uptake history. Dates on calcitic materials should only be accepted when there \nis negligible detrital thorium, or when initial thorium is accounted for using an isochron. \nNo statistical test is currently available to check the consistency of repeated U-series \ndates on the same sample, due to the nonnormal distribution of uncertainty on these dates. \nComparisons were therefore made less rigorously on the basis of overlap uncertainties at two \nstandard deviations. \nIn addition to criteria relating to the chronometric data, stratigraphic data need to be \nsubject to what might be termed \u201cstratigraphic hygiene\u201d in order for a reliable chronology to be \nconstructed: \n \n(1) the stratigraphic position of the hominid remains and of the dating samples should be \nsecurely known and clearly reported; \n(2) the stratigraphic relationship between the dating samples and hominid remains should \nbe similarly known; \n(3) there should be a correlation of dates with depth and\/or stratigraphic ordering, making \ndue allowance for the uncertainty estimates on the dates. \n \nThe dating of one deposit often depends on correlation with strata at another location, \neither within a site, across a region, or even across a whole continent. Within-site correlations are \n13 \nusually clear and uncontentious. Regional correlations are more difficult to prove. Tephra \nhorizons provide good markers (especially in eastern Africa), but their chemical and physical \nproperties are not always unique (Faupl et al., 2003), leading to occasional ambiguity. Regional- \nand continental-scale correlations are frequently by biostratigraphy, which can introduce even \ngreater ambiguity.  It must be assumed that faunal change over distances of up to thousands of \nkilometers was synchronous and that the current set of dates on faunal assemblages of a \nparticular biochronozone accurately represents its duration. It is certainly not true that a single \ndate at a single site can be directly transferred to all other sites with closely similar faunal \nassemblages as though a biochronozone had no duration. Biostratigraphy thus gives a good \ncheck on chronometric determinations, but on its own it can only provide broad temporal \ncorrelations. \nIn addition to the criteria for reliable dates, where parameters used in the dating \ncalculations might be chosen differently or revised in the future, the chronometric data should be \ngiven in sufficient detail to allow recalculation of the dates. In this study, dates were recalculated \nfrom published data, as described in the original papers, and any discrepancies were noted. This \nwas necessary as miscalculations occasionally occur. \n \nStatistical approach \nIn reanalyzing published dates that satisfy the criteria of chronometric hygiene given \nabove, this study attempts to quantify the range of possible dates of each specimen by modeling \nthe relation of hominid remains to dated materials using a Bayesian statistical framework \n(Christen, 1994; Litton and Buck, 1995; Zeidler et al., 1998; Christen, 2001; Buck, 2003). The \nBayesian approach to statistics is framed as taking a current state of knowledge, specified as a \n14 \nprior probability distribution, and updating that knowledge with observations to arrive at a \nrevised state of knowledge, specified as a posterior probability distribution. In an analysis of \nchronology, the stratigraphic evidence is taken as the prior information and is updated with \nchronometric data to provide posterior information. Thus, the key feature of this framework is \nthat it combines two forms of dating evidence: \n \n(1) the stratigraphic order of a sequence of events; \n(2) chronometric age estimates of those events. \n \nThe integration of these two forms of evidence allows: \n \n(1) refined estimates of the date of events included in the analysis; \n(2) the estimation of the date of any other event that can be included in the stratigraphic \nordering. \n \nIn order to do this, mathematical and statistical relationships between the dates of all of the \nevents have to be specified \nAs most hominid remains are not directly dated, but dated via stratigraphic relationships \nto directly dated samples, this is a powerful tool to assess the uncertainty of our knowledge about \nhominid fossils. The stratigraphic relationships between hominid fossils and dated sample are \nvaried and can be complex. However, the possible stratigraphic relationships can be expressed \nusing a small number of components that express the minimum information to record the whole \nstratigraphic sequence (Harris, 1989). Similarly a small number of components can be used to \n15 \nbuild mathematical models of stratigraphic orderings. For the purposes of this study, three cases \nof stratigraphic relationships are important, and their analysis can be contrasted with previous \napproaches to the process of data reduction required to estimate a fossil\u201fs date. \nCase 1: Where there are two dates from samples stratigraphically above and below a \nhominid fossil, the date of the fossil must lie between them. Traditional approaches have not \nusually attempted data reduction in this situation. The Bayesian approach is to construct a \nmathematical model expressing the stratigraphic sequence. The simplest model assumes that a \npriori the true dates of deposition of the fossil and of the two dating samples are each equally \nlikely to lie anywhere in a large time span, subject to them being in the correct order (Buck et al., \n1994). As the probability of deposition is the same throughout this period, it is represented by a \nuniform probability distribution and known by the shorthand label \u201cuniform prior.\u201d The prior \ninformation on the dates is thus vague and contributes little to the results. Once the chronometric \ndeterminations have been obtained, the information on the dates is greatly increased. A simple \nstratigraphic sequence such as this is found at Lainyamok (see below for details of the dating), \nwhere Potts and Deino (1995) simply stated the bracketing ages, but a Bayesian analysis yields a \nnumerical estimate of the date of the fossil itself. \nCase 2: A hominid fossil comes from a stratum with a number of dated specimens. \nPreviously, the approach to this situation has been to average the dates to give a \u201cbest estimate\u201d \nof the date of the fossil. However, this yields an estimate of the average date of the stratum, with \nan uncertainty on that average. If the stratum was deposited over an extended period of time, \nthen this average date may not be close to that of the fossil and the uncertainty of the date of the \nfossil is underestimated. The Bayesian approach to this situation is to model the deposition of the \nstratum as a period with events marking the start and end of deposition, both equally likely a \n16 \npriori to have true dates lying anywhere in a large time span, subject to them being in the correct \norder . Within this stratum, the deposition of the fossil and the dating samples are assumed a \npriori equally likely to have occurred at any point between the start and end, but there is usually \nno stratigraphic constraint on their order (Zeidler et al., 1998). In this case, there are two uniform \npriors: one on the start and end dates, and a second-level one on the events between those dates. \nFrom the observed dates within the stratum, the start and end dates are estimated, and thus the \ndate of the fossil that lies between them. The site at Taramsa has a stratigraphic sequence \nequivalent to this case, where averaging obtained a quite precise age of 63\u201348 ka, at 95% \nprobability (Vermeersch et al., 1998), but the application of a Bayesian approach yielded a range \nof 73\u201340 ka (see below for full discussion of the site). \nCase 3: Where a hominid fossil is directly dated or dated by a contemporary specimen, \nthis date is usually quoted as the date of the fossil without considering whether it can be refined \nby comparison with other stratigraphically related dates. The Bayesian approach incorporates \nthe date into the type of analysis described above to arrive at an improved estimate. \nOther more complex stratigraphies can generally be represented in terms of combinations \nof the above cases. For example, where there are three conformable strata, labeled I, II, and III \nwith increasing depth, with multiple dated samples from Strata I and III, and a hominid fossil \nfrom Stratum II, each stratum can be modeled as in Case 2, but with the additional constraint that \nthe end of Stratum III is the same date as the start of Stratum II and likewise for Strata II and I. \nMost sites considered here have stratigraphic sequences like this with conformable strata in one \ncontinuous sequence, and they are modeled in this way. A few are simpler and modeled as in \nCase 1, and a few are more complex. \n17 \nIf the published dates and stratigraphic information were all that was required to \nconstruct Bayesian statistical models to estimate the dates of hominids, then OxCal (Bronk \nRamsey, 2001) could be used for the calculations. OxCal is software primarily designed to \ncalibrate radiocarbon dates and incorporate them into Bayesian stratigraphic models, but it can \nalso include results from other techniques as dates with independent, normally distributed \nuncertainties. However, the dating techniques typically used on Pleistocene sites do not have \nnormally distributed uncertainties and, as discussed above, ESR and luminescence dates often \nhave components of their uncertainties that are common between samples and are thus not \nindependent. The methods of Millard (2006a,b) are necessary to account for uncertainties that \nare correlated and\/or not normally distributed. \nBayesian models of chronologies are not without their problems. In cases where there is a \nlot of dating information, the results depend only weakly on the assumptions embedded in the \nmodel of stratigraphy, but in cases where there are few dates or the intervals between events are \ncomparable to the uncertainties in the dates, the effects of these assumptions need to be assessed \n(Steier and Rom, 2000; Nicholls and Jones, 2001). In addition, although the models capture the \nimportant information from stratigraphy of ordering events in time, this is done at the cost of \nintroducing explicit statistical assumptions. The uniform prior is a repeated and statistically \nsimple assumption, but Nicholls and Jones (2001) showed that it implies a priori that long \ndurations between events are much more probable than short ones. Usually, this has little effect \non the results, as the chronometric data constrain the duration between events much more \nstrongly than the prior stratigraphic model, but in situations with complex stratigraphic models \nand few chronometric data, it can affect the results. This problem can be overcome by taking a \nmathematically (and computationally) more complex prior assumption that all durations of \n18 \ndeposition are equally likely. This is available as an option in OxCal (Bronk Ramsey, 2001), and \nknown as a \u201cuniform span prior,\u201d but it was not used for the analyses for this study, except where \nnoted. A uniform prior or a uniform span prior is a necessary but arbitrary assumption that \nconverts a stratigraphic statement about ordering into a quantified probability of a chronology so \nthat it can be linked to quantitative chronometric data (Steier and Rom, 2000). Thus, in applying \nthese stratigraphic models it is important to be aware of the effects of these assumptions and, \nwhen needed, to compare alternative models. Nevertheless, the Bayesian methodology for \nincorporating stratigraphic information gives a powerful means to assess the dates of fossils \nthemselves rather than just the dates of associated materials that are often discussed in vague \nterms or as if they are direct dates on the fossils.  \nThe results of Bayesian calculations are reported here as 95% posterior probability ranges \nfor the age of the event, given the stratigraphic model and chronometric data. Where only a \nminimum (or maximum) date can be calculated for a fossil hominid, a range cannot be given, \nand the most useful representation of date in these cases is the date that has a 95% probability of \nbeing a terminus ante quem or terminus post quem for the fossil. \n \nComputation \nWhere Bayesian stratigraphic models were used, dates were initially recalculated without \nstratigraphic constraints and compared to the published results to check for gross discrepancies \nand coding errors. They were then calculated incorporating the stratigraphic constraints as \ndiscussed below for each site. Where dates in a sequence were independent (or almost so) and \ncould be represented as normal distributions, calculations were performed in OxCal 3.10, \nentering the dates as calendar dates. Where the situation was more complex (e.g., where dates \n19 \nwere dependent on common external dose-rate estimates), the stratigraphic model and \nchronometric data were combined using a program coded specifically for the site using \nWinBUGS 1.3 or 1.4 (Lunn et al., 2000; Spiegelhalter et al., 2004) following the methods of \nMillard (2006a,b). Computer files for models are available from the author upon request. On \noccasion, information was not published fully enough to allow for reanalysis of a dependent set \nof dates, and these sites had to be analyzed as if the dates were independent, while recognizing \nthat such a procedure leads to underestimation of uncertainties. \n \nResults \nA number of sites with hominid remains do not have chronometric evidence for their \nages. These are summarized with a brief commentary in Table 1. Other sites are presented \nalphabetically by region for ease of reference. A full list of all chronometric determination used \nfor each site together with the corresponding posterior 95% probability ranges from Bayesian \nstratigraphic models is given in the online supplementary material. \n \nOlduvai and related sites \nThe inferred stratigraphic relationships among these sites and a summary of the \nchronometric evidence is shown in Figure 1. \nBodo, Ethiopia.  The hominid cranial and humeral fragments from Bodo are dated to the \nmiddle Pleistocene by associated fauna, and a terminus post quem is provided by laser-fusion \nAr-Ar dates on a tuff that is lower than the remains by stratigraphic correlation (Clark et al., \n1994). The Ar-Ar dates are a mixture of single- and multiple-grain ages and show some \ncontamination by older crystals, complicating their chronological interpretation. Clark et al. \nComment [MSU2]: Please check \ndeletion of \u201cq\u201d \nComment [ARM3]: deletion of \u201cq\u201d is \ncorrect \nComment [MSU4]: Need references \n20 \n(1994) preferred the pooled mean age of 630 \u00b1 30 ka, but allowed the weighted mean of single-\ngrain ages of 550 \u00b1 30 ka as a minimum age. Using the Ward and Wilson (1978) methods, the 13 \nindividual laser-fusion ages cannot all be combined to give a pooled mean age, and after the \nelimination of three outliers, the age is 705 \u00b1 18 ka. However, contrary to the chronometric-\nhygiene criterion of a strongly reproduced young age, the three laser-fusion ages eliminated are \nthe youngest ages (see supplementary information). A mixture analysis based on the assumption \nthat there are two normally distributed populations of crystals of different ages suggests a \nyounger component with mean age of 523 \u00b1 26 ka and an older component of 725 \u00b1 22 ka. From \nthis and from the calculation on single-grains of Clarke et al. (1994), it seems likely that there is \na younger component with an age between 500 and 600 ka, but reliable estimation of its age is \ndifficult with only 13 laser-fusion ages. \nClark et al. (1994) noted the similarity of the Bodo fauna to Olduvai Gorge Bed IV, \nwhich is dated to at least 490 ka, and possibly greater than 990 ka (see under Olduvai below). \nThe Ar-Ar date for Bodo, on the basis of any of the interpretations discussed above, lends weight \nto the short chronology for Olduvai. \nLainyamok, Kenya.  Lainyamok is important for its well-dated faunal assemblage and \nalso a hominid femur. The age of the deposits is constrained by K-Ar dates (920 \u00b1 10 ka and 890 \n\u00b1 30 ka) on the underlying Magadi Trachyte, and SCLF Ar-Ar dates on the volcanic mudflows \nnamed Khaki 1 and Khaki 2 (Potts and Deino, 1995). The bones came from the Khaki 2 deposit \nand are interpreted as having been deposited in hyena burrows in the Khaki 2 layer before \nsubsequent sedimentation, including deposition of Khaki 1 (Potts and Deino, 1995). As the date \nof the remains is tightly constrained by the Ar-Ar dates, the K-Ar dates do not feature in the \nanalysis here. Using an iterative technique to eliminate outlying (older) results in an isochron \nComment [MSU5]: References \n21 \nanalysis, and averaging two dates for each layer, Potts and Deino (1995) obtained dates of 330 \u00b1 \n6 ka for Khaki 1 and 392 \u00b1 4 ka for Khaki 2. Using OxCal, with a model assuming that the \nhominid femur is a priori equally likely to fall anywhere between these dates, a 95% confidence \nrange for its date of 328\u2013393 ka is obtained. \nOlduvai, Ndutu, and Ngaloba (Laetoli), Tanzania. Two hominid specimens that \npotentially fall into the period reviewed here have been found at Olduvai Gorge, and other \nspecimens have been found in the Ngaloba Beds at Laetoli and at Ndutu, which can be \nstratigraphically correlated with the Olduvai remains (Leakey and Leakey, 1977; Hay, 1987; \nMturi, 1976).  The stratigraphic sequence at Olduvai is of Beds I to IV followed by the Masek \nBeds, the Ndutu Beds, and the Naisiusiu Beds (Figure 1). Tamrat et al. (1995) considered the \nmagnetostratigraphy of the sequence from Bed I to the Masek Beds. They preferred a long \nchronology, correlating the reversed magnetization of the upper Masek Beds with the end of the \nMatuyama Chron at 990\u2013780 ka, but allowed that a short chronology was possible, with this \nreversed magnetization correlating to the Emperor Subchron at about 490 ka and the Brunhes-\nMatuyama boundary occurring high in Bed IV. Both chronologies place the end of the Olduvai \nsubchron at 1770 or 1790 ka, low in Bed II. Either magnetostratigraphic interpretation is \ncompatible with K-Ar ages on faulting that bracket the formation of the Masek Beds. MacIntyre \net al. (1974) reported a mean age of 321 \u00b1 44 ka for flows contemporary with faulting postdating \nthe Masek Beds. They also reported that faulting that predates the Masek Beds is bracketed by \nfaulted flows averaging 1217 \u00b1 22 ka and unfaulted flows averaging 1156 \u00b1 22 ka. The fauna \nfrom Bodo (Ethiopia) is similar to that in Bed IV at Olduvai, and dates to less than 646 \u00b1 42 ka, \nlending weight to the short chronology for Olduvai (see under Bodo above). \nComment [MSU6]: References \n22 \nThe Ndutu Beds have produced infinite radiocarbon dates from the upper unit (Hay, \n1976). The lower unit contains a marker tuff that is correlated to one in the Ngaloba Beds at \nLaetoli, containing the LH 18 skull (Hay, 1987). Hay (1987) estimated the age of this tuff to be \n120 \u00b1 30 ka but gave no basis for his estimate other than \u201cits relative stratigraphic position\u201d (p. \n45). At Mumba Shelter, uranium-thorium measurements on bones overlying this tuff provide an \napparent age of 132 \u00b1 7 ka (Br\u00e4uer and Mehlman, 1988). Similarly, bones from the tuff in the \nNgaloba Beds at Laetoli have produced an apparent uranium-thorium date of 129 \u00b1 4 ka (Hay, \n1987). Because of uncertain uranium-uptake histories, both of these dates should be regarded as \nunreliable, but they are probably minimum ages. The Naisiusiu Beds have produced infinite or \nnearly infinite radiocarbon dates (Skinner et al., 2003), or dates on materials now considered to \nbe unreliable, but recent work has produced LU ESR dates averaging 62 \u00b1 5 ka for the type \nsection (Skinner et al., 2003). \nThus, the few available dates form a coherent sequence for these sites, but they provide \nonly vague information about the ages of the hominids. While a chronological model could be \nconstructed, the results would be very sensitive to the prior assumptions. More dates are \nrequired; nevertheless, the dates for the hominids may be stated broadly as: \n \n(1) for the OH 11 maxilla, attributed to Lower Ndutu Beds (Leakey and Leakey, 1977), \n>62\u00b15 ka, certainly <990 ka, and probably <490 ka; \n(2) for LH 18, in the marker tuff (Hay, 1987), probably >129 \u00b1 4 and >132\u00b17, certainly <990 \nka, and probably <490 ka; \n(3) the Ndutu cranium underlies a tuff that is probably correlated with the Norkilili (upper) \nMember of the Masek Beds, which would make it older than LH 18, but the tuff could be \nComment [MSU7]: Need page numbers \nfor quote \nComment [MSU8]: Reference \nComment [MSU9]: Reference \nComment [MSU10]: Reference \nComment [MSU11]: Reference \nComment [MSU12]: Reference \n23 \nthat in the lower unit of the Ndutu Beds, which would make its possible age range similar \nto that of OH 11 (Mturi, 1976); \n(4) for the OH 23 mandible, from the Lower Masek Beds (Leakey and Leakey, 1977), either \n1070\u2013990 ka or (more likely) 780\u2013490 ka. \n \nMumba and Eyasi, Tanzania. These two sites are close together and their sedimentary \nsequences are linked (Mehlman, 1987). The report of initial dating attempts by Protsch (1981) on \nthe Eyasi remains using amino-acid racemization and radiocarbon was shown by Mehlman \n(1984) to be confused and to suffer from technical deficiencies. These data are not considered \nhere. Mehlman (1987) established the stratigraphic provenance of the surface-collected hominid \nremains as Member C of the Eyasi Beds. Absolute age constraints arise from an underlying \ntrachytic tuff in Member F, which is regionally correlated with tuffs in the upper Ngaloba Beds \nat Laetoli and the lower Ndutu Beds at Olduvai Gorge (Figure 1). From uranium-thorium dates \non bone at Ngaloba, this tuff has a possible minimum age of 129 \u00b1 4 ka (Hay, 1987) and a \nmaximum age given by a paleomagnetic reversal in the Norkilili Member of the Masek Beds at \nOlduvai of 490 ka or 990 ka (the short chronology is more likely: see above under Olduvai). A \nminimum age is provided by dates from sediments at Mumba Shelter, which overlie the Eyasi \nBeds. There are radiocarbon dates of 26,900 \u00b1 760 BP (ISGS-566 from Bed III) and a \nstratigraphically earlier date of 25,130 \u00b1 320 BP (USGS-1505 from Bed IV) (Mehlman, 1987). \nUranium-series measurements on a bone from Bed VI-B yielded a uranium-thorium age of 76132  \nka and a uranium-protactinium age of 4423109  ka (Br\u00e4uer and Mehlman, 1988). However, the \nconcordance between the two decay schemes is necessary but not sufficient evidence for a closed \nsystem, and U-series dates on bone cannot be relied on without investigation of their uranium-\nComment [MSU13]: Reference \nComment [MSU14]: Reference \nComment [ARM15]: refers to my own \nargument above \n24 \nuptake history (Millard and Pike, 1999), though they are most likely underestimates of the true \nage.  At Mumba Shelter, three human molars were found in layer VI-B (Br\u00e4uer and Mehlman, \n1988), and are thus broadly contemporary with the U-series-dated bones.  The remains from \nthese two sites are therefore rather imprecisely dated to between 990 ka and 132 \u00b1 7 ka, and \nmore likely between 490 ka and 132 \u00b1 7 ka, with Eyasi older than Mumba.  \nOther eastern African sites \nAduma, Ethiopia. Haile-Selassie et al. (2004) reported parts of four anatomically modern \nhominid crania from the Middle Awash region, 15 km from the Herto locality. Comparisons of \nlithic assemblages suggest that the remains are younger than the Herto formation (Haile-Selassie \net al., 2004) and therefore younger than 154 \u00b1 7 ka (see under Herto below). Yellen et al. (2005) \nreported Ar-Ar dating confirming that the deposits are younger than 180 ka, and various age \ndeterminations using U-series, TL, and OSL, which they regarded as problematic. No details of \nthe chronometric measurements were reported, so a critical examination of the dating evidence is \nnot possible. Yellen et al. (2005) considered the OSL ages of 91 \u00b1 5, 93 \u00b1 16, 92 \u00b1 15, and 93 \u00b1 \n10 ka to be the most reliable and concordant with their set of U-series dates on bone ranging \nfrom 79 \u00b1 1 to 105 \u00b1 14 ka. The fossils are therefore broadly dated to 100\u201380 ka, but not much \nconfidence can be placed on this date. \nGarba III, Melka Konture Basin, Ethiopia. Hominid cranial fragments were recovered at \nGarba III, which is located above all four tuffs in the Melka Konture Basin that can provide \nstratigraphic correlations (Chavaillon, 1982). The youngest tuff, Tuff D, has normal magnetic \npolarity and is placed within the Brunhes Chron (Westphal et al., 1979). As there are several \nphases of sedimentation and down cutting between Tuff D and Garba III, the hominids must be \nComment [MSU16]: Reference \n25 \nconsiderably younger than the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary at 780 ka (Berggren et al., 1995), \nbut no specific date within the Brunhes Chron can be given. \nHerto, Ethiopia. Fossil hominid material assigned to a new subspecies, Homo sapiens \nidaltu, consisting mostly of skulls and skull fragments, was described by White et al. (2003) and \ndated by Ar-Ar to between 154 \u00b1 7 and 160 \u00b1 2 ka (Clark et al., 2003). The maximum age comes \nfrom multiple dates on volcanically derived clasts in the fossiliferous unit, and the minimum age \ncomes from correlation of the overlying Waidedo Vitric Tuff (WAVT) with an unnamed tuff in \nthe Konso region of southern Ethiopia on the basis of geochemical composition. This unnamed \ntuff underlies the Konso Silver Tuff, which was directly dated by Clark et al. (2003).  Faupl et al. \n(2003) contested the security of the correlation of the WAVT to the unnamed tuff in Konso on \nthe grounds that this geochemical comparison is \u201chighly speculative,\u201d (Faupl et al. 2003: 622) as \nit does not include rare earth elements or isotopes. In a reply, Hart et al. (2003), demonstrated the \nclose geochemical similarity between the two tuffs. There seems to be no evidence against these \ntuffs being from the same eruption, though stronger correlations could be sought.  Ages have \nbeen recomputed from the supplementary data of Clark et al. (2003), and analyzed with \nstratigraphic ordering using OxCal. The resulting date for the Herto remains is 161\u2013150 ka. \nIleret (Guomde), Kenya. A hominid skull (KMN-ER 3884) and a femur (KNM-ER 999) \nwere recovered from the top of the Chari Member of the Koobi Fora formation (this member was \nformerly known as the Guomde Formation), close to the base of the Galana Boi Formation, \nwhich is latest Pleistocene to Holocene in age (Br\u00e4uer et al., 1997). Direct U-series dates by \ngamma-spectrometry on the bones yielded infinite ages, with a minimum 180 ka (Br\u00e4uer et al., \n1997).  Although this method is not very reliable (Millard and Pike, 1999), the date probably is a \nminimum. As the remains come from the top of the formation, they must postdate the Silbo Tuff, \nComment [MSU17]: Reference \nComment [MSU18]: Page number for \nquote \nComment [MSU19]: Reference \nComment [ARM20]: reference is at the \nend of the sentence \u2013 does it need citing \ntwice? \nComment [MSU21]: Reference \nComment [ARM22]: This information \nwas given and the reference cited two \nsentences prior to this one, I don\u201ft think it \nneeds repeating here. \n26 \nwhich is dated to 751\u00b122 ka, but there is a stratigraphic disconformity between the Chari \nMember and the Galana Boi Formation (McDougall and Brown, 2006), and thus the only \nestimate for the minimum age of the fossil is 180 ka. \nKapthurin, Kenya. Deino and McBrearty (2002) reported Ar-Ar dates for tuffs bracketing \nthe stratigraphic position of fossils KNM-BK 63 through KNM-BK 67 and KNM-BK 8518. The \nsingle-crystal laser-fusion ages on these tuffs are all concordant within a sample and yield an age \nof 509 \u00b1 9 ka for the overlying Grey Tuff, and 543 \u00b1 4 ka for the underlying K2 Pumice Tuff. A \nsimple stratigraphic model allowing a uniform prior probability that the hominid remains lie \nbetween the two tuffs yields an age of 547\u2013501 ka. Deino and McBrearty (2002) argued that, \nbecause the remains are known to come from about 0.7 m (KNM-BK 63 through KNM-BK 67) \nand 3 m (KNM-BK 8518) below the Grey Tuff, the ages may be interpolated. They inferred a \nsedimentation rate of 1 m\/kyr, but did not state the vertical distance between the two tuffs. From \nFigure 3 of Deino and McBrearty (2002), the distance is about 34 m vertically from the Grey \nTuff exposures to the K2 exposure in the Bartekero River valley, but only about 18 m to the \nexposure in the Kobosowany River valley, which is slightly closer horizontally but in a different \ndirection. Simple linear interpolation between the Ar-Ar ages using a 34 m distance gives ages of \n510 \u00b1 9 ka for KNM-BK 63 through KNM-BK 67 and 512 \u00b1 9 ka for KNM-BK 8518. Using an \n18-m distance gives ages of 510 \u00b1 9 and 515 \u00b1 8 ka, respectively. Whether taking interpolated \ndates or the broader dates of the simple stratigraphic model, these mandibles (KNM-BK 67 and \nKNM-BK 8518) and postcranial fragments (KNM-BK 63 through KNM-BK 65) are some of the \nmost precisely dated hominid remains from the Pleistocene of Africa. \nOmo Kibish, Ethiopia. Omo I and Omo II are cranial remains of modern human form \nthat, until recently, were poorly dated (McDougall et al., 2005). Renewed fieldwork in the region \nComment [MSU23]: Reference \nComment [ARM24]: reference is at the \nend of the next phrase \nComment [MSU25]: Reference \n27 \nand new laser-fusion Ar-Ar dates give a more reliable chronology (McDougall et al., 2005). Both \nremains derive from the upper part of Member I of the Kibish Formation, where they overlie a \ntuff. A second tuff about 50 m higher, in Member III of the formation, gives a minimum age.  \nMcDougall et al. (2005) claimed to have arrived at a consistent set of dates from the multiple \nlaser-fusion measurements on each sample, using iterative elimination of outliers more than 2 SD \nfrom the mean. Application of the chronometric-hygiene procedures advocated in this paper to \nthe fully published laser-fusion Ar-Ar dates on multiple groups of 1\u20136 crystals in pumice clasts \nyields slightly different results to the original publication (Table 2) and suggests four times as \nmany outliers in the data set. McDougall et al. (2005) combined dates from the three 02-01 \nsamples to arrive at a date for Member I and combined the four 99-275 and 99-274 samples to \narrive at a date for Member III. However, application of the Ward and Wilson (1978) statistical \ntest shows that, within each of these groups, the values differ significantly at the 5% level, \nwhether one takes the dates as originally calculated or as recalculated here. If the level of \nconsideration for averaging within either group is taken back to the level of the individual laser-\nfusion results, then Ward and Wilson\u201fs (1978) outlier-elimination method eliminates even more \nlaser-fusion measurements than when it is applied to clasts individually, and this larger group of \noutliers does not include some of the measurements identified as outliers from individual clasts. \nThus, there is not a single coherent date represented by the clasts, and the best estimate of the age \nof the deposit in which they lie is the age of the youngest clast in each case. On this basis, the \nhominid remains are dated to between 189.6 \u00b1 1.4 ka (sample 02-01B) and 99.8 \u00b1 1.0 ka (sample \n99-274A), but actually lie much closer in time to the former. This is a few thousand years \nyounger than the original publication\u201fs range of 196 \u00b1 2 ka to 104 \u00b1 7 ka.  \n28 \nPorc Epic (Dire Dawa), Ethiopia. A fragmentary piece of mandible was excavated in \n1933, and on the basis of excavations and subsequent obsidian-hydration dates was assigned a \nminimum age of 70\u201360 ka (Clark, 1988). However, Deacon emphasized that the mandible was \nrecovered \u201cfrom old excavations that lack modern standards of stratigraphic control\u201d (Deacon, \n1989:547-548). Assefa (2006) noted that the 1933 discoveries were poorly described and cannot \nbe related to the 1970s excavations that yielded the dated obsidian and gastropod shells with \nconventional radiocarbon dates from 33,700 \u00b1 300 to >43,200 BP. It seems unlikely that a date \nmore precise than later Pleistocene can be assigned to this fossil. \nSinga, Sudan. The hominid calvaria from Singa has been dated by McDermott et al. \n(1996). The enclosing calcrete gave one uranium-thorium date of 133 \u00b1 2 ka, confirmed by less \nprecise dates from isochron analyses of other samples of calcrete and from ESR measurements \non indirectly associated animal teeth (McDermott et al., 1996). As the calcrete formed after the \ndeposition of the calvaria, this constitutes a minimum age for the specimen. \n \nNorthern African sites \nJebel Irhoud, Morocco. The Irhoud 1\u20134 hominid specimens are poorly provenanced, but \nGr\u00fcn and Stringer (1991) reported ESR ages on three teeth from a level immediately overlying \nIrhoud 4, which produced five age estimates, though they are reported only as \u201cEU estimates \nrange between about 90 and 125 ka and the LU estimates between 105 and 190 ka\u201d (Gr\u00fcn and \nStringer, 1991: 185). These numbers seem to be reflected as error bars in their figure, and it is \nnot clear if these are confidence ranges for averages of the dates or ranges for the midpoint \nestimates, though the discussion of them by Hublin (1993) implies the latter. Hublin (1993) \nstated that the three dated teeth are stratigraphically close together and low in the sequence, and \nComment [MSU26]: Reference \nComment [MSU27]: Page numbers for \nquote \nComment [MSU28]: References \n29 \nthus that the spread of ages is problematic. However, without uncertainties on the dates, it is \nimpossible to assess whether they are statistically different. Amani and Geraads (1993) examined \nthe faunal collection and identified an additional hominid mandible fragment. Their estimate of \nthe age of the site was late middle Pleistocene, with a suggested maximum age of 150 ka. This \nfaunal date is more compatible with the LU ESR date than the EU one, but without more details \nof the dating, these remains can only be broadly placed as late middle Pleistocene. \nKebibat (Rabat), Morocco. The skull fragments and mandible known as \"Rabat Man\" \nwere placed by Saban (1977) in the middle Tensiftian (i.e., the middle of the middle Pleistocene) \nbetween his assignments of Sidi Abderrahman to the early Tensiftian and of Thomas Quarries \nand Sal\u00e9 to the late Tensiftian. The reasons for this placement are not fully detailed in his paper. \nThere are U-series dates by Stearns and Thurber (1965) on molluscs; however, these were \npublished in the very early days of U-series dating before the unreliability of dates on molluscs \nwas recognized. Thurber himself later coauthored a paper reviewing U-series dates on molluscs, \nincluding these, which concluded that they were all suspect until the uranium-uptake process in \nmolluscs are understood (Kaufman et al., 1971). Nothing more precise than a middle Pleistocene \nage can be assigned. \nMugharet el Aliya (Tangier, Morocco). Three hominid teeth and a juvenile maxilla were \nfound in Aterian contexts at this cave site, and probably originate in Layer 5 (Wrinn and Rink, \n2003). One ESR date has been obtained for each of layers 10, 9, 6, and 5, with the hominids \ncoming from the highest dated layer. Recomputation of the ESR dates of Wrinn and Rink (2003) \nshows that the gamma-dose rate from the sediment seems to have been miscalculated. For \nsamples 97121a\u201397123a, the reported dose rate equates to that computed using the conversion \nfactors of Nambi and Aitken (1986) without any attenuation due to water, rather than with \nComment [MSU29]: Reference \nComment [ARM30]: reference at the \nend of the sentence \n30 \nattenuation due to 10% water and the conversion factors of Adamiec and Aitken (1998), which \nare implied by the citation of Brennan et al. (1999). For sample 97120a, the calculations seem to \nbe as reported. Recomputing using ROSY 2.0 leads to 7\u201310% higher ages for samples 97121a\u2013\n97123a. Using a Bayesian stratigraphic model with the ESR ages gives a date for the hominid \nremains of 46\u201321 ka, assuming early uptake, and 57\u201327 ka, assuming linear uptake. \nTaramsa, Egypt. A child\u201fs skeleton in a burial was recovered from Middle Paleolithic \nquarry deposits (Vermeersch et al., 1998). The sequence of OSL dates for the quarrying are \ninadequately reported for a full model to be constructed. The dates are all associated with late \nMiddle Paleolithic contexts, as is the child\u201fs burial. Vermeersch et al. (1998) averaged a wide \nrange of imprecise dates to obtain a date of 55.5 \u00b1 3.7 ka. Using a model in OxCal that treats all \nof the dates and the skeleton as coming from a single coherent phase of deposition yields a date \nof 72.9\u201340.7 ka with a uniform prior or an almost identical date of 72.7\u201340.7 ka with a uniform \nspan prior. As the dates have not been fully modeled, the uncertainties are underestimated. \n \nSouthern African sites \nBlombos Cave, South Africa. Nine human teeth have been recovered from a number of \ndifferent Middle Stone Age (MSA) strata at Blombos (Henshilwood et al., 2001; Grine and \nHenshilwood, 2002). From the MSA levels, there is one reported date of 103 \u00b1 9.8 ka from the \nuppermost level, using a subtraction technique combining TL of quartz and infra-red stimulated \nluminescence (IRSL) of feldspars to overcome changes in environmental radiation dose rates \n(Vogel et al., 1999; Henshilwood et al., 2001). However, Henshilwood et al. (2001) considered \nthis date to be unreliable because there is evidence that the sample contained spalled cave-roof \nmaterial as well as aeolian grains. Overlying the MSA levels is an aeolian sand layer, which also \nComment [MSU31]: What does this \nstand for? \n31 \nfound outside the cave. This has been dated by OSL using both multiple-grain aliquots (Jacobs et \nal., 2003c) and single grains (Jacobs et al., 2003a,b). The two approaches yield equivalent results \nwithin their uncertainties. The multiple-grain-aliquot dates are based on the measurement of a \nmuch larger number of grains and are therefore more reliable, given that the single-grain \napproach showed the suitability of the samples for OSL dating.  \nBased on a model of the sand deposition in a single event, the three OSL dates can be \naveraged to give a minimum age of 70.1 \u00b1 1.9 ka (Jacobs et al., 2003c), which can be expressed \nas a 95% probability that the remains are older than 67.0 ka. Alternatively, it is possible to \nconsider these three OSL dates to represent a phase of deposition and calculate an age for the \nstart of the phase of deposition that represents the minimum age of the deposits. As the majority \nof uncertainty in the three dates is independent, it is feasible to calculate this by entering them as \ncalendar dates in OxCal to give an alternative minimum age of 69.0 ka at 95% confidence. \nBorder Cave, South Africa. Deposits at Border Cave spanning the MSA and Later Stone \nAge (LSA) yielded four ancient hominid specimens (Gr\u00fcn et al., 1990a). The stratigraphic \nsequence consists of an alternating series of brown sands (BS) and white ashes (WA) labeled \nwith 1BS as the youngest. The hominid remains BC1 and BC2 are of uncertain provenance, but \nthey have been linked to either layer 4BS or layer 5BS on the basis of adhering sediment; BC3 is \nan infant from a grave cut into 4BS that may have been dug during the deposition of the \nsubsequent layer 1RGBS; BC5 has a secure provenance of layer 3WA (Gr\u00fcn and Beaumont, \n2001). All are morphologically modern (Stringer, 2002). \nThe sequence has been dated by unpublished luminescence dates by Joan Huxtable (Gr\u00fcn \nand Beaumont, 2001), amino-acid racemization dates on ostrich eggshells published only as \naverages for each layer (Miller et al., 1999), a few bulk-charcoal conventional radiocarbon dates \nComment [MSU32]: By whom? \nComment [MSU33]: Reference \n32 \n(Gr\u00fcn and Beaumont, 2001), a series of AMS radiocarbon dates (Bird et al., 2003) for the upper \npart, and a series of 71 ESR determinations (Gr\u00fcn and Beaumont, 2001).  The ESR dates were \nanalyzed by Millard (2006a) using stratigraphic constraints and the same approach as in this \npaper. Two of the ESR dates were identified as outliers by Gr\u00fcn and Beaumont (2001), but their \nexclusion from the data set made negligible difference to the results of the calculations. Table 3 \ncompares the results of Millard (2006a) with those of Gr\u00fcn and Beaumont (2001), showing that \nthe revised chronology is slightly shorter for the deeper strata. \nDie Kelders, South Africa. Twenty-seven human remains have been recovered from \nseveral sets of excavations at Die Kelders Caves 1 and 2, constituting at least 10 individuals \n(Grine, 2000). They are mostly isolated teeth with two manual phalanges and a fragment of \nmandible. Their morphology is neither distinctively modern nor archaic (Grine, 2000). Eighteen \nof the specimens, including the phalanges and mandibular fragment, derive from Layer 6, \nwhereas the others are scattered through Layers 4\/5 (youngest), 8, 10, 11, 14, and 15 (oldest). \nElectron-spin-resonance dates have been obtained from layers 4\/5, 6, 10, and 12 (Schwarcz and \nRink, 2000) and from Layers 4\/5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 by luminescence (Feathers and Bush, 2000). \nEarly-uptake ESR and luminescence dates are in agreement, placing the deposits in the range of \n70 \u00b1 4 and 70\u201360 ka, respectively. Thackeray (2002) presented an alternative analysis using \nprincipal components analysis of micromammal-species abundance to derive a temperature index \nthat he compared to the marine oxygen-isotope record. However, Thackeray\u201fs analysis does not \nallow for any uncertainty in the reconstructed temperatures, so although his correlation of the \nsequence with a much younger date range spanning oxygen-isotope stage (OIS) 3 (i.e., 60\u201320 ka) \nmay be possible, it is impossible to tell if alternative ages are also compatible with this analysis. \nComment [MSU34]: References \n33 \nThe luminescence and ESR dates were reanalyzed for this study incorporating \nstratigraphic information and important correlations between the results of the techniques due to \nthe large uncertainty in water content of the sediments. Feathers and Bush (2000) calculated \nalternative dates using 10%, 15%, and 20% water content with an uncertainty of \u00b15%. Schwarcz \nand Rink (2000) calculated alternative dates assuming 10%, 20%, and 30% water content. It \nseems prudent to allow for this uncertainty by assuming a water content of 20 \u00b1 10%. Feathers \nand Bush (2000) conducted a detailed study of luminescence using TL, OSL, and IRSL, which \nwere all in agreement. The TL and OSL methods differ in the determination of the equivalent \ndose but have exactly the same dose rates for a given sample, so the equivalent doses were \ncombined. Infra-red stimulated luminescence is measured on feldspars and, as no checks for \nanomalous fading were conducted, the two IRSL samples were excluded from this analysis on \nthe grounds of chronometric hygiene, although it should be noted that they agree within their \nuncertainty with OSL dates on the same strata. The small cosmic-dose component was calculated \ndifferently in the original papers. For luminescence, 5.5 m of rock above the cave was assumed, \nwhile for ESR, 24 m of overburden was assumed. Examination of the photographs of Marean et \nal. (2000) shows that 5.5 m is likely to be the correct value, so the values given by Feathers and \nBush (2000) were used for this study instead of the values of Schwarcz and Rink (2000). Two of \nthe ESR samples were conjoining pieces of a tooth found in layers 4\/5 and 6, so these layers \nhave to be regarded as one stratigraphic unit for dating purposes.  \nOn the basis of a Bayesian stratigraphic model incorporating the luminescence dates and \nEU ESR dates, the hominids in layers 4\/5 and 6 can be placed at 72\u201348 ka, while those from \nlayers 8, 10, and 11 are 79\u201366 ka, 83\u201372 ka, and 85\u201373 ka, respectively. The hominids from \nlayer 14 are older than the oldest luminescence date in layer 13 and so are older than 78 ka. \nComment [MSU35]: Spell out \n34 \nOlder dates would be obtained by calculation using the luminescence dates with LU ESR dates, \nbut the two sets of dates are inconsistent with each other. These dates cover a wider range than \nthe 70\u201360 ka and 70 \u00b1 4 ka quoted in the original dating papers, as well as the assignment of 74\u2013\n59 ka (OIS 4) derived from sedimentological considerations (Grine, 2000). While it is possible \nthat the deposits accumulated over a short time interval, as assumed by Grine (2000), a longer \ntime span is also possible. \nEquus Cave, South Africa.  Equus Cave has yielded 10 human teeth of Pleistocene age \nand one mandibular fragment, probably from Pleistocene levels (Grine and Klein, 1985). The \ncave was formed in the Oxland Tufa, the youngest parts of which are dated to 230 \u00b1 17 ka by \nuranium-thorium (Vogel and Partridge, 1984). Butzer et al. (1978) stated that the sediments are \nolder than a widespread manganiferous patina. This patina is older than the Blue Pool Tufa II, \nwhich has a minimum radiocarbon date of 15,980 \u00b1 230 BP, and younger than the Blue Pool \nTufa I, which has uranium-thorium ages ranging from 30 \u00b1 3 to 103 \u00b1 6 ka (Vogel and Partridge, \n1984). The patina is also younger than a travertine at Witkrans Cave dated by radiocarbon to a \nminimum of 33,150 \u00b1 2,500 BP (Berger and Libby, 1966; Clark, 1971). Butzer et al. (1978) \nargued that the dissolution of Equus Cave was contemporary with the formation of the Blue Pool \nTufa I. The human remains are thus broadly constrained between a calibrated radiocarbon age of \n17,600\u201316,850 BC and the formation of the Oxland Tufa at 230 \u00b1 17 ka and most likely belong \nto the period between 103 \u00b1 6 ka and 30 \u00b1 3 ka. Given the weak stratigraphic correlations, a \nmore sophisticated analysis is not warranted. \nFlorisbad, South Africa.  Parts of a cranium and a maxilla were recovered from the \nFlorisbad spring deposits in 1932 (Gr\u00fcn et al., 1996). The only dating, by ESR and OSL, was \nreported by Gr\u00fcn et al. (1996). No details of the chronometric measurements were given, with \nComment [MSU36]: Reference \n35 \nmost ages shown only on a diagram and a few central ages and uncertainties given in the text. \nThere is a stratigraphic sequence of dates by both methods, but the reliability of the ESR dates \nmust be considered uncertain, as Figure 1a of Gr\u00fcn et al. (1996) shows that they decrease with \nincreasing depth. An ESR date on a fragment of the hominid tooth gave a date of 259 \u00b1 35 ka, \nwhile the OSL date on the peat in which it was found was 281 \u00b1 73 ka (Gr\u00fcn et al., 1996; \nBamford and Henderson, 2003). The best available estimate for the age of the hominid remains \nis the 95% confidence range of the direct ESR date, 329\u2013189 ka. \nHoedje\u2019s Punt, South Africa.  The dating of the layer that contains human teeth and other \nremains is unclear due to underreporting of chronometric data. The initial report on the site \n(before hominid remains were found) by Volman (1978) assigned a broad age based on finds of \nMSA artifacts. Berger and Parkington (1995) discussed the site in more detail and suggested that \nthe foraminiferal assemblage in the hominid-bearing layers indicated a marine regression prior to \nthe OIS 5 to 4 transition, (i.e., prior to 78 ka). However, a calcrete capping the whole \nstratigraphic sequence is said to yield a U-series age of about 300 ka, with no further details \ngiven (Berger and Parkington, 1995). Neither these authors nor subsequent ones have discussed \nhow such an old age is possible for a capping deposit, given the other data. More recently, \nStynder et al. (2001) quoted unpublished luminescence ages that placed the overlying DAMA \nlayer at ca. 117 ka and the hominid-bearing HOMS layer at younger than 550 ka. Citing faunal \ncorrelations to the Florisbad Faunal Span and the ESR date on the Florisbad hominid (Gr\u00fcn et \nal., 1996), Stynder et al. (2001) suggested \u201ca maximum age around 250 ka\u201d (p.372) but then \nstated that the hominid bearing sands were \u201cmost probably deposited between 200 ka and 300 ka \nago\u201d (p.372). . Klein (1999: 399) assigned an age of 300\u201371 ka based on \u201cU-series, geologic \ncontext, associated fauna.\u201d Given these pieces of evidence, it seems that the age of the remains \nComment [MSU37]: Page numbers for \nquote \n36 \nmust lie between the luminescence ages (though without uncertainty estimates this is not a \nparticularly useful statement) and be within the floruit of the Florisbad fauna, which itself can \nonly be stated to include the 259 \u00b1 35 ka date of the Florisbad hominid. \nKabwe (Broken Hill), Zambia.  The remains of \u201cRhodesian Man,\u201d along with faunal \nremains, were discovered in 1921 by miners (Klein, 1973). The principal dating is based on \nKlein\u201fs (1973) assessment that the fauna is similar to that at Elandsfontein and broadly similar to \nthose from Olduvai Gorge Upper Bed II through to Bed IV. There are no chronometric \ndeterminations. On the basis of the faunal correlation to Olduvai (Figure 1), an age of younger \nthan 1780 ka and, depending on the chronology for Olduvai, either older than 990 ka (on the \nlong chronology) or, more likely, older than 490 ka (on the short chronology) may be assigned \n(see under Olduvai above). This is consistent with Elandsfontein being older than 330 \u00b1 6 ka \n(Table 1). \nKlasies River Mouth, South Africa.  Klasies River Mouth (or Klasies River Main \nSite KRM) has a yielded a long sequence of stone tools and fossil hominids (Singer and \nWymer, 1982). It serves as a reference sequence for many aspects of the MSA in southern \nAfrica. The deposits are divided into a series of members (Figure 2), starting with the Lower \nBrown Sands (LBS), followed by the Sand-Ash-Sand (SAS), Rockfall (RF), White Sands (WS), \nand Upper members, with the Upper Member divided into the Howieson\u201fs Poort (HP) and \nMiddle Stone Age 3 (MSA3) (Singer and Wymer, 1982). Hominid fossils have been found in \nnumerous layers within all members but RF, but the majority come from the lower part of the \nSAS Member (Singer and Wymer, 1982). The morphological status of the fossils has been \nsummarized by Grine et al. (1998: 106) as \u201csuggesting a pattern of overall, albeit incomplete \nmorphological modernity. The cranial and especially the postcranial bones from KRM present a \nComment [MSU38]: References \nComment [MSU39]: References \nComment [MSU40]: References \n37 \nmixture of primitive and modern features.\u201d A number of dating attempts have been made and \nreported in varying detail. Amino-acid-racemization ages have been published in summary form \n(Brooks et al., 1993; Miller et al., 1999), whereas luminescence dates have been published in full \n(Feathers, 2002), as have ESR dates (Gr\u00fcn et al., 1990a) and U-series dates on speleothems \n(Vogel, 2001). \nTwo of the dates reported for KRM were rejected on chronometric-hygiene grounds. The \nESR sample 547 was \u201cfound on the floor and thought to be derived from the nearby wall\u201d (Gr\u00fcn \net al., 1990a: 429), and therefore does not have a secure stratigraphic provenance. The TL and \nOSL measurements of the burial dose for luminescence sample UW227 differ significantly, \nthough they should be the same, and this sample was therefore rejected as unreliable. \nFor calculation of the chronology, the estimates of water content with the most \nconservative errors are those of Feathers (2002) of 20 \u00b1 10% throughout, except 6 \u00b1 3% in the \nWS Member. The variable cosmic dose rates through the site as estimated by Feathers were \nused. For the U-series dates at KRM, a correction for initial \n230\nTh had to be made. Following \nVogel (2001), the reasonable but arbitrarily chosen value of unity was taken for the initial \n230\nTh\/\n232\nTh ratio. \nKlasies River Mouth has one of the more complex stratigraphic orderings considered in \nthis paper (Figure 2), with the RF and WS members both overlying the SAS Member but not \nable to be ordered stratigraphically. In addition, a stalagmite from the SAS member has internal \nordering of multiple U-series dates from the base to the top. All of these orderings are included \nin the calculations. Some strata do not have temporal constraints on both their start and end, and \na terminus ante quem or terminus post quem for the stratum was calculated. \nComment [MSU41]: Page number for \nquote \nComment [MSU42]: Page numbers for \nquotes \n38 \nAnalysis of the luminescence, U-series, and ESR dates yields dates for hominids from the \nvarious units as shown in Table 4. The differences between the chronologies in the lower strata \nare small compared with the ages and make little difference to their interpretation in terms of \nhuman evolution, but in the higher strata, the differences are a significant proportion of the ages. \nThe revised ages are broadly compatible with the previous estimates by Deacon (1989), but \nsuggest a wider range of dates for the SAS Member. The Howieson\u201fs Poort industry is shown to \nbe later than Deacon\u201fs estimate, with the modeled start of the industry in the interval 65\u201349 ka \n(EU) or 63\u201351 ka (LU). This is somewhat later than the 82\u201368 ka date for the start of the \nHowieson\u201fs Poort at Border Cave (Millard, 2006a). The morphologically modern fossils from \nthe lower SAS Member are most likely earlier in the possible range for that member, but without \na significant number of additional dates, it is not possible to know the date more precisely. There \nis clearly scope for additional ESR and OSL dating, targeted specifically at the SAS Member, \nand it would be worth revisiting the U-series dating using modern high-precision mass-\nspectrometric techniques. \nMumbwa, Zambia.  A series of teeth and long-bone fragments have been recovered from \nmiddle and late Pleistocene levels at Mumbwa (Pearson et al., 2000). The sequence is dated by \nTL dates on sediments and one OSL date. Electron-spin-resonance dating has been carried out, \nbut no details were reported by Barham and Debenham (2000). The sequence of dates conforms \nto the stratigraphy, except that the two dates from lowest in the stratigraphy, separated by 3 m of \nsediment, are virtually identical at 172 \u00b1 22 ka (Unit XIV) and 172 \u00b1 21 ka (Unit IX). Barham \nand Debenham (2000) rejected the age on the lowest sample as too young, citing the \nmicromammal evidence of Avery (2000), and placed Unit XIV (the bottom of the sequence) at \naround 255 ka. Avery\u201fs (2000) reconstruction of climate from the micromammals suggested a \n39 \nseries of climatic fluctuations in the lowest 3 m, which were correlated to marine isotope stages \nusing the chronology of Barham and Debenham (2000). Given the circularity of these arguments, \nthere appears to be no strong argument for rejecting the TL date from Unit XIV, and there is no \nindication of any technical problem, such as saturation of the TL signal or incomplete bleaching. \nGiven the uncertainties of the dates, a simple analysis of the possible difference between these \ndates suggests that it is 60\u20130 ka at 95% confidence. Avery assigned each stratigraphic unit of the \nsite to a separate isotope stage or substage, but it seems quite possible that some of the variations \nare within-OIS variations, and that there was a rapid accumulation of sediment.  \nInsufficient detail of the luminescence-dating measurements is given for a full analysis \nfollowing the methods of Millard (2006b), so the sequence was analyzed for this study by \ntreating the dates as calendar dates in OxCal. This model puts the radial fragments from Unit XII \nat 220\u2013149 ka, the two tooth fragments from Unit X at 204\u2013138 ka, and the lower second molar \nand femoral fragment from Unit VII at 148\u201374.8 ka. \nSea Harvest, Saldhana Bay, South Africa.  The only chronometric determination from \nthis site is an infinite radiocarbon date of >40 ka from a shell midden stratigraphically above the \nhorizon which contains a human manual phalanx and a premolar (Grine and Klein, 1993). Grine \nand Klein (1993) placed this material younger than 128 ka, as it is stratigraphically higher than a \nwave-cut platform of the last interglacial. On the basis of the fauna, they suggested that a last \nglacial age of 128\u201374 ka is most likely. \n \nLevantine sites \nAmud, Israel.  Remains of 18 individuals have been discovered, 15 from Middle \nPaleolithic contexts, and all from layers B1 and B2, except one from the earlier layer B4(Valladas \nComment [MSU43]: Reference \n40 \net al., 1999). Three skeletons are Neandertal in morphology Amud I from layer B1 and Amud II \nand Amud 7 (an infant) from layer B2 (Valladas et al., 1999). The ESR dates on teeth (Rink et \nal., 2001) and TL dates on burnt flints (Valladas et al., 1999) have been obtained from the three \nrelevant layers. The latter papers contain inconsistencies in the chronometric data. Valladas et al. \n(1999) gave uncertainties on the internal and external doses and uncertainties on their dates that \nare consistent with one another, but the overall dose rates received by the flints have \nuncertainties that are much greater than implied by the other data. The reported uncertainties on \nthe overall dose rates were assumed to be incorrect and the consistent part of the data was used \nhere. Flints from Squares O14 and O15 were excluded due to disturbances that are likely to have \naltered the external radiation dose. Examination of the values in the tables of Rink et al. (2001) \nand reproduction of their calculations show that all samples were dated using in situ \nmeasurements by gamma-spectrometry or TL dosimetry and none of the gamma dose rates used \nwere calculated from sediment compositions, despite what is stated in the text. The in situ \nmeasurements were also used here. Following Rink et al. (2001), they were assumed to represent \nradiation dose with a water content of 10% and an uncertainty of 10%.  Using the US-ESR \nuptake model, Rink et al. (2001) computed ages that fall midway between the EU and LU ages, \nwhich themselves only differ by a few thousand years.  Table 5 shows the results of the Bayesian \nstratigraphic models for Amud. In comparison to the summary of Valladas et al. (1999), the new \nchronology is less certain, but in comparison to the averages presented by Rink et al. (2001), the \n95% probability intervals are more precise than their 1\u03c3 ranges. The age for layer B1, which \ncontained the Amud I Neandertal, suggests that it is similar in age to the Kebara Neandertal or \nslightly younger. \nComment [MSU44]: References \nComment [MSU45]: References \n41 \nDederiyeh, Syria.  Remains of fifteen Neandertal individuals have been recovered from \nMiddle Paleolithic contexts at this site, including two burials (Akazawa et al., 2004), but the site \nhas not yet been systematically dated. Akazawa et al. (2004) reported that there are six \npreliminary radiocarbon dates ranging from 48,100 \u00b1 1200 to 53,600 \u00b1 1800 BP for layers 2\u20133, \nwhich are high in the stratigraphic sequence. \nKebara Cave, Israel.  Various excavations have yielded 29 separate hominid finds \nassociated with the Mousterian levels in this cave(Bar-Yosef et al., 1992). The most important is \nthe well-preserved burial of an adult male Neandertal from Bed XII (Bar-Yosef et al., 1992). \nThermoluminescence dates on flint have been obtained for Beds VI (youngest) to XII (oldest) by \nValladas et al. (1987), but were only reported as mean dates for each layer. Schwarcz et al. \n(1989) obtained ESR dates for Bed X, the bed that they presumed \u201ccorresponds most closely to \nthe \u201eliving floor\u201f at the time of burial.\u201d (Schwarcz et al., 1989: 654) Using the full data on the TL \ndating (Valladas, pers. comm.) and the ESR data, it makes little difference whether EU or LU \nESR dates are used, because of the small difference between them in this site and the dominant \neffect of 37 TL dates. Two dates were omitted from the calculations: the TL date on flint \nN21,109 because the reported \u03b1- and \u03b2-dose rates are inconsistent with the reported radioelement \nconcentrations, and the ESR date on tooth fragment H17cmoust, as the reported zero \u03b2-dose rate \nfrom the sediment seems to be an error. Most of the human remains catalogued by Bar-Yosef et \nal. (1992) come from layers IX, X, and XII, and the computed dates for these layers are shown in \nTable 6. The revised chronology is more precise for layers IX and X than the previous \nchronology based on simple averaging of TL dates but is essentially unbounded for layer XII, as \nthere are no dates below this level. \nComment [MSU46]: References \nComment [MSU47]: References \nComment [MSU48]: References \n42 \nQafzeh, Israel.  This site has yielded five anatomically modern human burials, with \nfragments of up to 11 other individuals (Vandermeersch, 1981). The hominid remains come from \nlayers XV (youngest) and XVII (oldest) of Vandermeersch and co-workers, excavated from 1965 \nto 1979, and layers F and L of Neuville, excavated from 1932 to 1935 (Vandermeersch, 1981). \nLayer F is not correlated with those of Vandermeersch and co-workers, from which the \nchronometric samples came, but layer L corresponds to layers XVII\u2013XIX (Vandermeersch, \n1981). Valladas et al. (1988) obtained TL dates on flint from layers XVII\u2013XXIII, while \nSchwarcz et al. (1988) obtained ESR dates on odd-numbered layers from XV to XXI. \nUnfortunately, the ESR dates were reported without any chronometric data, and even without \nuncertainties, so that all that is available is a set of point estimates for one or two teeth per layer, \nand it is not possible to reanalyze these data. \nOn the basis of a Bayesian stratigraphic model incorporating the TL dates, hominids Q8\u2013 \nQ12 and Q14\u2013Q17 from layer XVII date to 95.2\u201387.0 ka. Specimens Q13 and Q18 from layer \nXV are not directly dated by the TL ages, but on the limited evidence of the ESR ages, they are \nunlikely to be much younger than the others. The stratigraphic positions of Q3 and Q6 are less \nwell known, so they date to 96.9\u201387.6 ka. These dates are more precise than the 92 \u00b1 5 ka \naverage of TL dates for layers XVII\u2013XXIII of Valladas et al. (1988) and reinforce their \nsuggestion that the whole hominid assemblage accumulated rapidly.  \nShanidar, Iraq.  Nine Neandertal skeletons were excavated at Shanidar by R. Solecki in \nthe 1950s. They were all found in the upper half of Layer D, which contained Mousterian tools, \nand was sealed by the Upper Paleolithic Layer C (Trinkaus, 1983). Two radiocarbon dates from \nthe top of Layer D of 46,900 \u00b1 1500 BP (GrN-2527) and 50,600 \u00b1 3000 BP (GrN-1495) (Vogel \nand Waterbolk, 1963) and the correlation of a pollen-based climate sequence led Solecki (1963) \nComment [MSU49]: References \n43 \nto place the middle of Layer D at about 70\u201360 ka. Radiocarbon dates obtained so long ago and of \nsuch great age are likely to be minimum ages. No other more direct dating evidence is available \nfor these fossils, so the best evaluation of their age is that they are over 50 kyr old by an \nindeterminate amount. A stalagmitic crust within Layer D predates all of the Neandertal remains, \nand, if still accessible, offers the opportunity for U-series dating, which might elucidate the date \nof this important hominid sample. \nSkhul, Israel.  Excavations by Dorothy Garrod recovered remains of 10 modern human \nindividuals from burials in Layer B at Skhul (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2005). Layer B was divided into two \nparts distinguished by their hardness, with Layer B1 overlying Layer B2 (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2005). \nThermoluminescence dates have been obtained on six burnt flints (Mercier et al., 1993), which \nwere subsequently shown to have derived from Layer B2 (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2005). Electron-spin-\nresonance dates and U-series dates were obtained on 11 animal teeth and the hominid remains \nSkhul II and Skhul IX (Stringer et al., 1989; Gr\u00fcn et al., 2005). The stratigraphic position of the \nhuman and animal remains is known to be Layer B, but whether they came from B1 or B2 is \nunclear (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2005). The descriptions of Skhul II suggest that it may have come from \nLayer B1, and the depths of Skhul IX and Skhul V strongly suggest that they derive from Layer \nB2 (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2005). Two of the animal teeth were found in direct association with these \nhuman burials (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2005).  \nSchwarcz et al. (1980) reported U-series ages on travertines from the alcove in which \nSkhul III was discovered. Unfortunately, the extent of removal of sediments makes stratigraphic \ncorrelation of these samples with the hominid and other remains impossible, and the dates of 79 \n\u00b1 4 ka on one sample and >350 ka on three others cannot be used to estimate the dates of the \nhuman burials. \nComment [MSU50]: References \nComment [MSU51]: References \n44 \nThe three ESR and TL dating studies have taken different approaches to calculating the \nexternal dose rate of their samples, although in principle, the same \u03b3- and cosmic-radiation \nsources were irradiating all of the samples. Stringer et al. (1989) computed a 380 \u03bcGya\u22121 \u03b3-dose \nrate from dry sediment using chemical analysis of sediment attached to teeth and other archived \nsediment samples. They assumed a cosmic dose rate of 120 \u03bcGya\u22121 on the basis of less than 2 m \nof overburden and a water content of 10 \u00b1 10%. Mercier et al. (1993) used this \u03b3-dose rate \nestimate, but assumed a water content of 15% \u201con the basis of palaeoclimatic data\u201d (Mercier et \nal., 1993: 173) (which was not specified), and a cosmic dose rate of 100 \u03bcGya\u22121 taking into \naccount the geometry of the adjacent cliff. They assumed \u00b130% uncertainty on the external dose \nto allow for inhomogeneous chemical composition and variations in water content. Translated \nentirely into an uncertainty in water content, this would be equivalent to assuming a water \ncontent of 15 \u00b1 31%. Gr\u00fcn et al. (2005) reevaluated the external doses. They analyzed a much \nlarger suite of sediment samples and examined what is known about the stratigraphic position of \ntheir samples. To allow for sediment inhomogeneity, they calculated dose rates by weighting the \ndose rate from sediment attached to the tooth at 25% and that from the bulk sediment at 75% (as \n25% of the \u03b3-dose comes from sediment within 5 cm of the sample). They also noted that two \nsamples (1057 and 1058) from close to the bedrock may have received lower dose rates. Their \nwater content estimate is 10 \u00b1 5%. \nFor the purposes of integrating all dating evidence here, common assumptions for all the \ntechniques were required. Water content was taken as 10 \u00b1 10%, the most conservative of the \npublished values. Sediment \u03b3-dose rates for ESR samples were weighted following Gr\u00fcn et al. \n(2005). The uncertainty in the contribution to this dose rate from the wider sediment, and for the \nentire dose rate for the burnt flints, was computed by assuming that the sediment U, Th, and K \nComment [MSU52]: Page number for \nquote \n45 \nconcentrations are lognormally distributed with the same means and standard deviations as the \nset of sediment samples reported by Gr\u00fcn et al. This assumption is based on the facts that trace-\nelement distributions are well approximated by a lognormal distribution (Aitchison, 1986) and \nthat lognormal distributions give a better fit to Gr\u00fcn et al.\u201fs (2005) compositional data than \nnormal distributions. This assumption also has an advantage over the unwritten standard \nassumption of normal distributions, in that negative concentrations (and dose rates) cannot occur \nin the calculations. The cosmic dose rate of 116 \u00b1 17 \u03bcGya\u22121 of Gr\u00fcn et al. is the most carefully \nconsidered estimate and was used here. In cases where bedrock contributed to the \u03b3-dose rate, \nGr\u00fcn et al. (2005) took its infinite matrix dose rate as 90 \u03bcGya\u22121 without uncertainty. As this was \nbased on an in situ \u03b3-spectrometer measurement, an uncertainty of \u00b19 \u03bcGya\u22121 was assumed here \non the basis of a typical \u03b3-spectrometer uncertainty of 10%. \nGr\u00fcn et al. (2005) reported combined U-series-ESR analyses of six samples, which ought \nto give more reliable ages because the assumptions of EU or LU can be relaxed. Unfortunately, \nthere is currently no mechanism for fully including such dates in a Bayesian analysis. The US-\nESR model and the CSUS-ESR model yield similar dates, and those dates are very close to the \nLU dates, so the best Bayesian computations that can currently be made are with LU dates and \nprobably yield results close to the true values. \nComputing on this basis leads to the dates given in Table 7. Direct association with ESR \nsamples leads to more precise dates for Skhul IX and Skhul V than for the other hominids, which \ndo not have directly associated dating samples. Although the Skhul hominids have been widely \nconsidered to date to 100\u201390 ka, the results here show a great uncertainty in their true age. These \nresults contradict several of the conclusions of Gr\u00fcn et al. (2005): Skhul V appears quite likely to \nbe younger than Skhul IX, the estimate for the date of Skhul V is somewhat younger than Gr\u00fcn \n46 \net al.\u201fs estimate, and the possibility remains that some or all of the hominids other than Skhul V \nand IX are late Middle Paleolithic or Upper Paleolithic in age. \nTabun, Israel.  Tabun has one of the deepest and longest hominid- and artifact-bearing \nstratigraphies in the Levant and has served as a reference sequence for the region. Preservation of \nskeletal material is variable in the deposits, and correlation of the strata reported by excavations \nover a period of more than 60 years is not straightforward. Initial excavations in the 1930s \ndivided the sequence into Layers A (youngest) to F (oldest), separate from the sequence in \nChimney II (Garrod and Bate, 1937). \nHominid remains were recovered in the 1930s excavations by Garrod and Bate (1937). \nThey were numbered B1, B3, B4, and B5 from Layer B, C1 to C7 from Layer C, E1 from Layer \nEa, and E2 from Layer Eb. Specimens BC2 and BC6 were recovered from Chimney II. \nSpecimens C1 and C2 are also known as Tabun I and Tabun II. Most authors consider all of \nthese specimens to be Neandertal in form (Oakley et al., 1977). Bar Yosef and Callander (1999) \nreviewed the evidence for the stratigraphic position of C1 and suggested that there is a possibility \nthat it originates from Layer B. Coppa et al. (2005) reviewed all the dental material from Tabun \nand suggested that there is a new individual, BC7, from Layer B, although they identified the \nteeth with those that Garrod and Bate (1937) reported as recovered from the outermost fringe of \nLayer C. Electron-spin-resonance measurements show that the radiation dose received by the \nteeth is consistent with doses of animal teeth in Layer B and not with those from Layer C (Coppa \net al., 2005). Coppa et al. (2005) disagreed with some previous tooth identifications, but apart \nfrom suggesting that BC2 and B5 represent the same individual, they did not suggest any other \nrevised stratigraphic assignments. \nComment [ARM53]: I don\u201ft think this \nneeds a reference, it is my own summary \nafter reading all the literature cited in this \npaper \nComment [MSU54]: References \nComment [MSU55]: Reference \n47 \nAnimal tooth enamel from the archive of Garrod\u201fs excavation has been dated using ESR \n(Gr\u00fcn et al., 1991; Gr\u00fcn and Stringer, 2000), with external dose rates estimated from sediment \nsamples attached to the teeth or otherwise in the archive.  Subsequent excavations directed by \nJelinek (1982) and Ronen (Ronen and Tsatskin, 1995) have also recovered datable material. \nJelinek and Ronen provided more detailed stratigraphic sequences, but these are not always \ndirectly correlated with the larger units used by Garrod. A sequence of TL dates on burnt flint \nderive mostly from flints recovered by Jelinek (Mercier et al., 1995, 2000; Mercier and Valladas, \n2003) from strata correlated with Garrod\u201fs Layer C and below. Rink et al. (2004) obtained ESR \ndates for a single tooth recovered in Ronen\u201fs excavation from layers equivalent to Garrod\u201fs \nLayer Ed. \nUranium-series dating was carried out on animal teeth by McDermott et al. (1993) and on \nthe bones of hominid C1 by Schwarcz et al. (1998). The difficulty of knowing the uranium-\nuptake history renders these dates problematic, but while those obtained from teeth can be used \nto constrain the uptake model used for the ESR dates, Millard and Pike (1999) showed that the \nmeasurements made on the bones of Tabun C1 are of little use for dating. \nThe TL dates of Mercier et al. (1995, 2000) and the ESR dates of Gr\u00fcn et al. (1991) have \nbeen the subject of debate, as they disagree in the lower levels of the site. Mercier et al. (1995) \nsuggested that the elemental concentrations in the sediments used by Gr\u00fcn et al. (1991) had been \naltered postdepositionally, thus shortening the ESR chronology. Gr\u00fcn and Stringer (2000) \nshowed that the differences persist with a larger suite of sediment samples from the Garrod \ncollection, and their analyses are therefore likely to be representative of the sediments from \nwhich the teeth came. A further problem is the poor correlation of Jelinek\u201fs stratigraphy with \nGarrod\u201fs sequence. Farrand (1994) discussed the fact that Garrod\u201fs layers were not natural \n48 \nstratigraphic units, being at least partially based on stone-tool typology, and the reality of the \nstratigraphy is much more complex than might appear from the small number of labeled layers. \nGarrod excavated the entire contents of the outer chamber of the cave, so \u201cthere is no way of \nrelating Garrod\u201fs finds to Jelinek\u201fs stratigraphy in detail\u201d (Farrand, 1994: 34), and doubts must \nalways remain about the relationship between the two stratigraphic sequences and the position of \nthe hominids within them. At best, the hominid remains can be assigned to Garrod\u201fs layers, but \nthe possibility remains that hominid C1 actually derives from Garrod\u201fs Layer B (Bar-Yosef and \nCallander, 1999). \nAs the latest revision of the TL chronology (Mercier and Valladas, 2003) updates both \nthe internal dose rates and the equivalent doses, but does not give detailed data for either, and it \nis impossible to calculate the appropriate figures from the published data, the TL dates cannot be \ntreated fully using the methods of Millard (2006b). Consequently the chronologies presented \nbelow used the TL dates as independent estimates of calendar dates, ignoring any correlation of \nuncertainty between them. The resulting chronologies are likely to have somewhat \nunderestimated uncertainties. \nAs a consequence of the problems outlined above, several models were used to calculate \nfive alternative chronologies, shown in Table 8: TL only, EU-ESR only, LU-ESR only, TL with \nEU ESR, and TL with LU ESR. Of these, the last two are not internally coherent due to the \ndifferences between results from the two techniques, and are dependent on the assumption that \nthe correlation of Jelinek\u201fs and Garrod\u201fs stratigraphies is correct. These combined TL-ESR \nchronologies are presented for comparative purposes only. \nFrom the data of McDermott et al. (1993), U-series dates using EU or LU can be \ncalculated and compared to ESR dates calculated on the same basis, in order to help resolve \nComment [MSU56]: Page number for \nquote \n49 \nwhether EU or LU dates are more reliable. The comparison shows that all U-series dates fall \nwithin error of the published ESR dates, except for LU dates from Layers D and Ea, but the \nuncertainties of the ESR dates are so large as to render the comparison largely meaningless. \nComparison of the U-series ages with the dates from the Bayesian stratigraphic models (Table 8) \nshows that EU U-series dates mostly fall short of the date for the relevant stratum from the TL-\nonly chronology and short of the posterior date for the same sample in the two EU-ESR \nchronologies. In contrast, LU U-series dates are generally older than the TL-only and the two \nLU-ESR chronologies. Overall, when the dates computed here are compared to the relatively \nprecise U-series dates, no more than two of the six U-series dates match with the dates of \nappropriate samples or layers in the modeled chronology, but the EU dates for U-series and ESR \nare less discrepant than the LU dates. The U-series determinations are not useful in forming a \nchronology themselves, but they do indicate that, all else being equal, the true chronology should \nbe shorter than the LU-ESR chronology and closer to but longer than the EU-ESR chronology. \nThese chronologies are mostly more precise than the comparable published chronologies. \nExpressed as 95% probability ranges, they make it clear that all hominids from Tabun are \nimprecisely dated, but especially those from Layer B and, on the TL chronology, Layer C. The \nrevised chronologies are slightly younger than the previously published ones, but not sufficiently \ndifferent to change the broad placement of the fossils. The TL and EU-ESR chronologies show a \nmeasure of agreement on the date of Layer C, but still differ in Layers Ea and Eb. \nThe conundrum of which chronology TL or ESR best dates the Tabun hominids \nremains. The ESR dates are better associated stratigraphically with the hominid remains, but \ndoubts remain over the reliability of that stratigraphy, the sediment dose rates, and the uptake \nmodel to use, while the TL dates have a more secure stratigraphic sequence and more certain \n50 \nexternal dose rates, but even weaker correlation with the hominid fossils\u201f stratigraphic positions. \nThe TL-only and EU-ESR-only chronologies represent the two best alternatives, though that \nbased on EU-ESR will be shorter than the best possible ESR chronology, and the uncertainties in \nthe one based on TL are underestimated. To resolve the chronology of this important site will \nrequire further dating, with samples carefully chosen to avoid as many of the problems with \nreliability as possible that have limited this analysis. \nZuttiyeh, Israel.  The Zuttiyeh partial cranium was excavated in the 1920s, and its \nstratigraphic position within the cave was poorly recorded (Schwarcz et al., 1980). It appears to \ncome from below the artifact-bearing layers, which yielded Acheulo-Yabrudian tools. The only \nchronometric dating that has been performed is U-series on travertines Schwarcz et al. (1980) \nreported an age of 164 \u00b1 21 ka for a sample that they considered to be coeval with or postdating \nthe skull. Other dates on Acheulo-Yabrudian assemblages suggest that it may well be as old as \n400\u2013200 ka (Barkai et al., 2003). If Schwarcz et al. (1980) correctly interpreted the stratigraphy, \nthen the skull must be older than 122 ka. \n \nDiscussion \nFrom the compilation and consideration of the chronometric evidence for African and \nNear Eastern hominids, a series of issues and problems relating to chronological data can be \nidentified, and the revised chronology has implications for various aspects of our understanding \nof human evolution. \nComment [MSU57]: References \n51 \n \nProblems with chronological data \nStratigraphic hygiene. In some cases, doubts about the stratigraphic provenance of a \nfossil are recorded in the literature (e.g. for BC1 and BC2 from Border Cave; Gr\u00fcn and \nBeaumont, 2001), but the stratigraphic positions are frequently stated as if they are confidently \nknown. For many fossils this confidence is warranted, but doubts may have been forgotten, as \nhappened with Tabun B1 (Bar-Yosef and Callander, 1999). With the more recent remains, there \nis the particular problem in which graves cut into lower levels but are not recognized as such \nduring excavation, as demonstrated by the direct dating to the Neolithic of the supposedly \nAurignacian human remains from Vogelherd (Conard et al., 2004). Direct dating of hominids is \nmore difficult beyond the range of radiocarbon, and thus this will always be a problem for earlier \nremains.  Uncertainties about the stratigraphic provenance of some hominid fossils are \ninevitable, and even though the deliberate selection of dating samples that lack stratigraphic \nrelationships with the hominids, fauna, or archaeology of interest is avoidable, it has happened \n(e.g., at KRM [ESR sample 547] and Skhul [U-series dating]). \nLack of datable materials. Despite the large number of chronometric determinations \nreviewed here, some fossils are still only dated by faunal correlations or to broad time periods \nbetween dated stratigraphic horizons. In some cases the lack of precision in our knowledge of \ntheir dates extends to hundreds of millennia, so that they cannot be chronologically ordered with \nother fossils with full confidence. In some cases, this may be the best that can be done, as no new \nevidence can be adduced (e.g., the Berg Aukas femur); however, it is clear that, if some key \nspecimens (e.g., Kabwe) are to be securely placed and used to infer evolutionary sequences, then \nimproved dating techniques are required. \n52 \nTechnical aspects of chronometric hygiene. For significant proportion of sites considered \nin detail above, inadequate reporting of the details of the chronometric data that support the dates \npresented is a problem. No examples of full reporting of amino-acid-racemization data were \nfound. Of the 34 sites examined, six had luminescence dates reported at a level of detail \ninadequate for reevaluation, as did three for ESR, two for U-series, and one for Ar-Ar. Authors \nneed to publish the detailed data, or make it available on request, especially as (1) calculation of \ndates depends on constants such as half-lives that have been revised over the years, and (2) three \nof the papers that did give full data contained errors in the calculations or performed them \ndifferently from their stated method. For the trapped-charge techniques (ESR, OSL, TL), \ndifferent authors were occasionally inconsistent in their calculations of dose rate from the same \nsediment, which can be excused due to the passage of time between the application of the \ndifferent techniques, but cannot be excused when it occurs in consecutive papers in the same \njournal (i.e., Feathers and Bush, 2000; Schwarcz and Rink, 2000). \nDating of bones, teeth, and mollusc shells by ESR or U-series depends on an \nunderstanding of uranium uptake, and lack of understanding has clearly hampered the \nconstruction of reliable chronologies. This led to competing EU and LU chronologies at most \nsites dated by ESR, and there were four cases of U-series dating of bone and one of mollusc \nwhere these were presumably the only materials available, but the dates had to be rejected as \nunreliable. A better understanding of uranium-uptake processes, as has been achieved to a certain \nextent for bone (Millard and Hedges, 1996), would be an important advance in dating. \nLaser-fusion argon-argon dating generates large numbers of dates on an individual \nsample, and the assessment of the consistency of those dates and the evaluation of the likely true \ndate of the sample is a crucial part of the procedure. Previous methods of data reduction were \n53 \ncritiqued above, and the method of Ward and Wilson (1978) advocated for determining the \ncoherence of a set of dates. However, although the Ward and Wilson (1978) method is adequate \nto determine whether the dates are the same, it may not be the best method for identifying \noutliers. It would therefore be preferable if formal statistical methods for outlier detection could \nbe developed based on an understanding of the physical processes involved. \nUse of the literature. In conducting this review of the chronometric evidence for African \nand Near Eastern hominids, the search for the detailed chronometric data was hampered by \noverreliance of many authors on the secondary literature. It is not uncommon to find a date cited \nfrom a publication, which upon checking simply cites another publication, which cites another, \nwhich cites the paper that first suggested the date. Frequently in such a chain of citations, the \njustification for the original date is lost, and in some cases, error limits disappear. For example, \nthe ESR date of 259 \u00b1 35 ka for the Florisbad hominid (Gr\u00fcn et al., 1996) can be applied to the \nFlorisbad fauna, but somehow in the discussion of Stynder et al. (2001), this becomes simply \u201ca \nmaximum age of around 250 ka\u201d (p.372) for the Florisbad Faunal Span, and in McBrearty and \nBrooks (2000), it becomes a bald 260 ka age without any uncertainty for the Florisbad hominid \nitself. Sometimes, the primary proposal for a date is based solely on comparisons of morphology \nto the best-dated fossils at the time of publication, and for later papers to suggest evolutionary \nsequences based on this date is obviously problematic. Given the flux in dating methods, the fact \nthat problems have often been identified some time after the introduction of these methods, and \nthe changing understanding of the dates of faunal successions, every author should be beholden \nto check the basis of the dates cited and apply some basic chronometric hygiene. \nComment [MSU58]: This sentence is \ndifficult to follow; should be rewritten and \nsimplified \nComment [MSU59]: Page numbers for \nquotes \n54 \n \nImplications of the revised hominid chronology \nTable 9 and Figures 3 and 4 summarize the chronology for fossil hominids developed in \nthis paper. Figure 3 shows that the geologically older specimens are relatively poorly dated, and \nthose dates rely mainly on faunal correlations. In particular, where the relevant specimens have \nbeen considered here, there is imprecise dating of hominids assigned to Group 1 by McBrearty \nand Brooks (2000) or to Homo ergaster and early H. sapiens by Klein (1999: 265\u2013266). A few \nare well dated, and their ordering is fairly clear (Kapthurin, Lainyamok, Florisbad, Tabun, \nMumbwa), but of these, only Florisbad and Tabun are particularly diagnostic (Klein, 1999: 275). \nThe age estimated here for Kabwe differs significantly from that quoted by previous \nauthors, and, with the date for Bodo, places the appearance of archaic H. sapiens before 490 ka. \nHowever this date is dependent on the two sites\u201f faunal correlations with Olduvai, and it is \ntherefore only semiquantitative and not entirely certain. A direct comparison of the Bodo and \nKabwe faunal suites might help strengthen the dating. This early dating is similar to that of OH \n23, which is usually assigned to H. erectus or H. ergaster, and therefore the relationship between \nthese specimens should be reevaluated. \nThe geologically younger fossils (shown in Figure 4) tend to have more precise and \nbetter-defined ages, due in part to a number of more recent excavations focused on MSA sites \nand the availability of several alternative chronometric techniques (ESR, TL, U-series) \napplicable to sites dating to less than 250 ka. The dating of Omo by McDougall et al. (2005) \nchanged the dates from those of previous compilations, and, with the remains from Herto, \nsuggests a longer chronology for what are recognized as morphologically modern humans. \nConversely, the dates deduced for Jebel Irhoud are younger than those used by the previous \n55 \nstudies, but again rely on the fauna, though in this case the support of poorly reported ESR dates \nadds confidence to the faunal analysis. The Qafzeh hominids are closely dated and somewhat \nmore recent than Stringer (2002) had placed them. In contrast, the remains from Skhul, which are \nconsidered to be very similar in morphology, are much less precisely dated and not necessarily \ncontemporary with Qafzeh. With the Q3 and Q6 specimens date at 97\u201388 ka and Skhul IX dated \nat 173\u2013106 ka, it is clear that Skhul IX is earlier than all of the Qafzeh hominids. The possibility \nshould be considered that the two sites represent different populations, even perhaps separate \nincursions of African H. sapiens into the Levant during OIS 5c (Qafzeh) and OIS 5e (Skhul). \nIn general, the dates arrived at here are less certain than many of those presented in the \nliterature, and consequently, the current chronological scheme is compatible with various \nhypotheses about the evolution of H. sapiens. The three previous studies summarized in Table 9 \n(and numerous others) have confidently ordered fossils, labeling them early or late and archaic or \nmodern, but the dates presented appear to be selective, and sometimes towards one end of the \npossible range for a particular fossil. The construction of evolutionary sequences depends on the \nuse of both morphology and dates, but given the uncertainty of the chronometric evidence, it \nseems that many of these evolutionary schemes order fossils on the basis of their morphology. \nWhere we have well-dated fossils, some of the sequences conform to expectations based on \njudgments of the archaic or modern nature of their morphology but others do not.  This is \nexemplified by the near closeness in date of Omo I and Omo II demonstrated by McDougall et \nal. (2005), in contradiction to many previous studies that concluded that these formerly poorly \nprovenanced specimens were of widely different ages due to their different morphologies. \nWithin the chronology developed, here it would be feasible that there was more morphological \nComment [MSU60]: Date for reference \n56 \nvariability than is envisaged by most accounts of the evolution of H. sapiens. Whether this is so, \nor merely due to the chronological uncertainties, remains to be seen. \nThe issue of the sequence of modern human and Neandertal occupation of the Near East \nhas been debated for many years. The chronometric evidence reviewed here shows that some of \nthe remains can be put into temporal order with confidence, but that much ambiguity remains \n(Figure 4). It is clear that the Qafzeh modern humans are younger than Tabun C and Zuttiyeh, \nand that the Neandertals from Kebara and Amud B1 are younger than Skhul V and IX and \nQafzeh, as are the remains from Taramsa. The two species therefore did alternate in their \noccupation of the Levant, but the dating needs to be much more precise if a link between these \noccupations and climatic changes is to be proved or disproved. \n \nConclusions \nOverall this study has found that, for hominid fossils from Africa and the Near East, the \ndating evidence for many key fossils is poor and that, in many cases, they cannot be ordered in \ntime.  The current chronology of the African and Near Eastern fossil hominids is unable to \ndiscriminate between the evolutionary schemes of the out-of-Africa hypothesis (Stringer, 2002), \nthe multiregional hypothesis (Thorne and Wolpoff, 2003), and the hybridization-and-\nreplacement hypothesis (Br\u00e4uer, 1989; Br\u00e4uer et al., 1997). Within this region these models \ndiffer only slightly in their ordering of fossils, but comparison with Asian (and to a lesser extent \nEuropean) fossils is also necessary. The chronology of these fossils will be the subject of a future \npaper. \nIn order to put our understanding of human evolution over the last half million years on a \nfirmer footing, further work in the dating and chronology of the fossils is required. Different sites \n57 \nwill require different techniques, but a few promising methods need wider application, especially \nthose applicable to materials excavated many years ago. Uranium-series dating of bone using the \ndiffusion-adsorption model (Millard and Hedges, 1996; Pike et al., 2002; Pike et al., 2004) has \nproved its value in a few cases, and while it cannot be guaranteed to produce a date in every \ncase, it should be used more often. Direct ESR dating of hominid fossils using small fragments \nof enamel has also reached a similar state of development (Gr\u00fcn et al., 2003; Gr\u00fcn et al., 2005). \nAn advantage of these techniques is the direct dating of hominid material with a relatively small \namount of destructive sampling. For sites with extant stratigraphy and documented positions of \nthe hominid fossils, there are of course a wider range of techniques that can and should be \napplied for example, dating of Klasies River Mouth has been improved by sampling for \nluminescence dates many years after the original excavations (Feathers, 2002). \nAn alternative, and perhaps more widely useful development, would be an improved \nchronology for the African faunal sequence and quantitative methodologies for comparison of \nfaunal assemblages to derive dates. From the literature reviewed here, it is clear that a similar \nand larger-scale project could reevaluate the dates of faunal assemblages. In addition, there are \nmethods for quantitatively correlating and dating faunal assemblages for example, Alroy\u201fs \n(2000) dating of North American fauna or Weiss et al.\u201fs (2003) analysis of trilobite faunas, \nwhich might be applied to African sites.  Overall there is still much to be done to date the \nevidence for the last half million years of human evolution in Africa and the Near East. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper was written as a product of research leave funded jointly by Durham \nUniversity and the UK Arts and Humanities Research Board (award number \nComment [MSU61]: References \n58 \nRLS:APN15253\/AN9564).

(1995: 151) stated that it is \u201cnot possible \u2026 to place [the femur] in a \ngeochronological context.\u201d There is no associated fauna. \nCave of Hearths, \nSouth Africa \nHominid mandible \nfrom Bed 3 and radius \nfragment from the fill \nof a sinkhole \nThe dating of this site is poor and the literature is confused. Mason (1988) \ndescribed it but gave very limited information on its dating. Beds 1\u20133 contained \nAcheulean materials, and he assigned them an age of 500\u2013200 ka (p. 181), or \n250\u2013200 ka (Fig. 20C on p.47; see also p. 580), though no reasoning was given \nfor either range of dates. He noted the mixed nature of the ESA and MSA \nmaterials in the sinkhole (p. 75) but considered that the radius was most likely \ncontemporary with the mandible, given its morphology (p. 189). Pearson and \nGrine (1997) cautiously assigned the radius to either late ESA or MSA. Mason \n(1993) mentioned the mandible, suggesting a possible age of 250 ka in his \nabstract, but did not discuss dating in the body of the article. Br\u00e4uer et al. (1997) \nplotted a most likely age of 200 ka but did not indicate to which fossil it refers \nnor the source of the date. \nDar es-Soltane, \nMorocco \nTwo adult skeletons Br\u00e4uer et al. (1997) plotted a \u201cmost likely\u201d age of 90 ka for these skeletons, but \ncited no reference for this. Oakley et al. (1977) suggested a \u201cfinal Soltanian\u201d \nage, which would place the deposits in the late glacial, younger than 35 ka.  \nElandsfontein (alias \nHopefield, Saldanha), \nSouth Africa \nCalvaria and part of a \nmandible \nThe remains were recovered from surface deposits. There are no chronometric \ndeterminations. Klein and Cruz-Uribe (1991) described the fauna as early mid-\nQuaternary and suggest a date of \u201cperhaps\u201d 700\u2013400 ka by comparison to dated \nfaunal sequences. Potts and Deino (1995) suggested a minimum age of 330 \u00b1 6 \nka by comparison with the Ar-Ar dated fauna at Lainyamok.  \nEliye Springs, Kenya Cranium Although the cranium was found out of stratigraphic context in deposits \nreworked by wave action, Br\u00e4uer and Leakey (1986) considered that it probably \ncame from deposits underlying the Holocene Galana Boi beds. They assigned a \ndate of 200\u2013100 ka based on cranial morphology. Br\u00e4uer et al. (1997) plotted a \nmost likely age of 200 ka but gave no reference for this. Only a probable pre-\nHolocene date can be assigned. \n80 \nKabua, Kenya Partial cranium and \nmandible \nA partial cranium and mandible were found in surface collection in the Turkana \nDistrict. They may derive from late Pleistocene lake sediments or from more \nrecent burials intruded into those sediments. Rightmire (1975) considered that \nthey were closer morphologically to modern H. sapiens than to the Kabwe skull. \nThere is no real evidence to assign anything other than a broad possible date \nrange of late Pleistocene or Holocene. \nWadi Dagadl\u00e9, \nDjibouti \nMaxilla This is broadly dated from the associated fauna to 900\u2013100 ka (de Bonis et al., \n1988). \nGeulah Cave, Israel Three fragmentary \nanatomically modern \nhuman bones \nThese were found in a Mousterian context in the cave (Arensburg, 2002). They \nare therefore older than 40 ka and younger than about 250 ka on comparison \nwith the sequence at Tabun. \nNadouiyeh A\u00efn Askar, \nEl Kowm, Syria \nParietal attributed to H. \nerectus \nThis was discovered in the complex deposits of a spring at this site and was \nhypothesized to be between 350 and 450 ka by correlation with the date of the \nYabrudian at Tabun and the date of marine isotope stage 12 (Jagher et al., 1997). \nSubsequently, the parietal was stated to have been found in a late Acheulean \ncontext dated to 400\u2013150 ka (Muhesen, 2001), but also to be about 450 ka in age \n(Le Tensorer et al., 2001). Only a vague middle Pleistocene age can be assigned. \nSal\u00e9, Sidi \nAbderahman, and \nThomas Quarries, \nMorocco \nVarious hominid \nremains \nAll three sites are late Amirian or early Tensiftian in age and likely \ncontemporary with the Anfatian marine transgression(s) (Hublin, 1985). The \nAnfatian can be correlated with either oxygen-isotope stages 7, 9, and 11 \n(Hublin, 1985) or 9, 11, and 13 (Ward, 1985), so the age is uncertain but likely \nbetween 190 ka and 525 ka. \nTighenif (alias \nTernifine), Algeria \nTeeth, mandibles, and a \nparietal \nThe sediments are normally magnetized and the fauna are younger than several \nmiddle early Pleistocene sites and older than Thomas Quarries and therefore \nclose in time to the early\/middle Pleistocene boundary (Geraads et al., 1986). \nHublin (1985) equated this to 1000\u2013600 ka. However, the combination of fauna \nand normal magnetization supports Klein\u201fs (1999: 275) assignment of an age of \nslightly less than 780 ka.  \nUm el Tlel, Syria Small fragment of an \nadult Neandertal \nMuhesen (2004) remarked on the existence of these remains but gave no source. \nBo\u00ebda et al. (1999) mentioned preliminary TL dating of Mousterian levels, \nwhich had yielded \u201can age in excess of 50,000 years\u201d (p. 394). \n \nComment [MSU90]: Page numbers for \nquote \n81 \nTable 2 \nDates of pumice clasts in the Kibish Formation \nMember Sample \nnumber \nNumber of \nLF-Ar-Ar \nmeasurements \nNumber of outliers removed  Weighted mean age (ka) \nMcDougall et al.

EU-ESR and LU-ESR dates, the LU chronology is listed. These are Skhul, Klasies \nRiver Mouth, Amud, Kebara, and Mugharet el Aliya. The TL chronology is shown for Tabun. Where the possible dates are \nconstrained by ages with uncertainties, the two-standard-deviation limit of the age has been taken. All dates in this table are rounded \nto the nearest 1 ka. Dates marked * are dependent on the choice of long or short chronology for Olduvai; the more likely short \nchronology dates are shown. The dates derived from Figure 3 in Stringer (2002) are approximate.  The midpoint dates from Figure 1 \nin Br\u00e4uer et al. (1997) are given without the original error bars of \u00b110 ka.  Abbreviations are as follows: u = a lack of quantitative \ndating information, p = partially quantified dating information, m = the stated range is a 95% probability range from a statistical \nmodel, e = early, m = middle, l = late, Mid Pl = middle Pleistocene, Upp Pl = upper Pleistocene.  \n91 \nFigure captions \nFigure 1.

Summary of dates deduced for \u201cearlier\u201d hominids, with most likely ages older than \n200 ka. Where chronologies based on EU and LU ESR differ only slightly, the LU chronology is \nshown, as in Table 9. Two chronologies are shown for Tabun, with solid lines for the TL-only \nchronology and dotted lines for the EU-ESR-only chronology. Sites marked * are dependent for \ntheir upper or lower limit on the assignment of a date to the magnetic reversal in the Masek \nBeds. As plotted, the more likely date of 490 ka has been taken, but the 990 ka date cannot be \nexcluded.
