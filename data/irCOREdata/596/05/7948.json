However, a serious drawback in the molecular analysis of\nthe nervous system of L. stagnalis has been the lack of large-scale genomic or neuronal\ntranscriptome information, thereby limiting the use of this unique model.\nResults: In this study, we report 7,712 distinct EST sequences (median length: 847 nucleotides) of\na normalized L. stagnalis central nervous system (CNS) cDNA library, resulting in the largest\ncollection of L. stagnalis neuronal transcriptome data currently available. Approximately 42% of the\ncDNAs can be translated into more than 100 consecutive amino acids, indicating the high quality\nof the library. The annotated sequences contribute 12% of the predicted transcriptome size of\n20,000. Surprisingly, approximately 37% of the L. stagnalis sequences only have a tBLASTx hit in the\nEST library of another snail species Aplysia californica (A. californica) even using a low stringency e-\nvalue cutoff at 0.01. Using the same cutoff, approximately 67% of the cDNAs have a BLAST hit in\nthe NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide sequence databases (nr and nt), suggesting that\none third of the sequences may be unique to L. stagnalis. Finally, using the same cutoff (0.01), more\nthan half of the cDNA sequences (54%) do not have a hit in nematode, fruitfly or human genome\ndata, suggesting that the L. stagnalis transcriptome is significantly different from these species as\nwell. The cDNA sequences are enriched in the following gene ontology functional categories:\nprotein binding, hydrolase, transferase, and catalytic enzymes.\nPublished: 23 September 2009\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:451 doi:10.1186\/1471-2164-10-451\nReceived: 13 February 2009\nAccepted: 23 September 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/451\n\u00a9 2009 Feng et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:451 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/451Conclusion: This study provides novel molecular insights into the transcriptome of an important\nmolluscan model organism. Our findings will contribute to functional analyses in neurobiology, and\ncomparative evolutionary biology. The L. stagnalis CNS EST database is available at http:\/\/\nwww.Lymnaea.org\/.\nBackground\nThe freshwater pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis (L. stagnalis,\nLinnaeus, 1758), belongs to the phylum Mollusca (Gastro-\npoda, Basommatophora, Pulmonata, Lymnaeidae). Simi-\nlar to other gastropods such as the marine snail Aplysia\ncalifornica (A. californica) and the terrestrial snail Helix\naspersa, L. stagnalis has served successfully as a model for a\nwide spectrum of studies in molecular, cellular, and\nbehavioral neurobiology. As compared to the mamma-\nlian brain with 1011 neurons and Drosophila melanogaster\n(D. melanogaster) ganglia comprising 200,000 neurons, L.\nstagnalis has a relatively simple central nervous system\n(CNS) consisting of a total of ~20,000 neurons, many of\nthem individually identifiable, organized in a ring of\ninterconnected ganglia (Figure 1). Most neurons of the L.\nstagnalis CNS are large in size (diameter: up to ~100 \u03bcm),\nthus allowing electrophysiological dissection of neuronal\nnetworks that has yielded profound insights in the work-\ning mechanisms of neuronal networks controlling rela-\ntively simple behaviors such as feeding [1,2], respiration\n[3,4], locomotion [5], and reproduction [6,7]. Studies\nusing the CNS of L. stagnalis as a model have also identi-\nfied novel cellular and molecular mechanisms in neuro-\nnal regeneration [8-11], synapse formation [12-15],\nsynaptic plasticity [16], learning and memory formation\n[17,18], the neurobiology of development [19-22] and\naging [23-25], the modulatory role of neuropeptides [26-\n28], and adaptive responses to hypoxic stress [29-32].\nContrasting the large body of dedicated studies in neuro-\nbiology, the molecular analysis of genomic information\nof L. stagnalis is rather limited. The only available tran-\nscript sequence data set of L. stagnalis includes 1,320\nexpressed sequence tags (ESTs; derived from 771 different\nsequences) generated from L. stagnalis CNS libraries that\nwere not normalized [33]http:\/\/www.nematodes.org\/\nNeglectedGenomes\/MOLLUSCA\/. The lack of adequate\ntranscriptome and genome information of L. stagnalis is\ncurrently a large drawback for the use of this species in\nfunctional and comparative molecular studies [34].\nMollusks have more than 100,000 extant species and\ncomprise the second largest phylum after the Arthropods\n[35,36], indicating the phylum has been highly adaptive\nto environmental changes since its origin in the Cambrian\nperiod [35]. The gastropods are the largest group within\nthe mollusca encompassing over 80% of the extant spe-\ncies [37]. However, in contrast to their abundance and\nimportance in neurobiology, large-scale genomic infor-\nmation relating to neuronal function is limited to one spe-\ncies, A. californica [38]. There are two additional on-going\ngenomic sequencing projects of mollusks: Lottia gigantea\n(L. gigantean; http:\/\/genome.jgi-psf.org\/Lotgi1\/\nLotgi1.download.html) and Biomphalaria glabrata (B. gla-\nbrata; http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/sites\/ent\nrez?Db=genomeprj&cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSe-\narch=12878); however, the genomic sequence informa-\ntion from these two species is currently not yet available.\nAs L. stagnalis and A. californica genera are believed to have\ndiverged over 600 million years ago, the sequencing of the\nCNS transcriptome from L. stagnalis holds significant\npromise for functional, evolutionary, comparative and\nenvironmental studies of Mollusks and other species.\nThe dissected central ring ganglia of Lymnaea stagnalisFigure 1\nThe dissected central ring ganglia of Lymnaea stagna-\nlis.

This study provided 10,375 EST sequences, which\ncluster to 7,712 unique sequences. Despite a substantial\nfraction of the cDNAs being homologous to A. californica\nsequences in the existing known sequence database, data\nanalysis revealed that the majority of the L. stagnalis\ncDNAs are novel and have no known homologues. There-\nfore, our findings argue for the sequencing of the full tran-\nscriptome of this species. This study forms the basis for\nfunctional genomic research of L. stagnalis not only as a\nmodel system for various areas of neuroscience research\nbut also for general evolutionary and comparative genom-\nics.\nResults\nOverall statistics of the L. stagnalis cDNA library\nDouble-end sequencing was performed on 5376 clones\nthat were randomly selected from the L. stagnalis CNS nor-\nmalized library. After deleting the vector sequences, we\nsuccessfully obtained a total of 10,375 EST sequences\n(GenBank EST Acc. number: ES291075 - ES291826;\nES570937 - ES580561), which cluster to 7,712 unique\nsequences. The median length of the sequence reads was\n838 nucleotides (mean 803 nt), the shortest being 20, and\nthe longest cDNA being 1044 nucleotides. In fact, close to\n90% of the raw sequences (9272) are longer than 700\nnucleotides (Figure 2A). The mean and median G+C con-\ntent of the cDNA library is 36%.\nPost-processing and sequence assembly\nTo estimate the level of sequence redundancy and overlap\nwithin our library, we first ran a BLAST search against the\nraw sequence library itself, and noticed that a large\nnumber of sequences overlap, most likely as the result of\nbi-directional sequencing. We then assembled the cDNA\nsequences by using the CAP3 software [39], which identi-\nfied 6,139 singlet sequences, and 1,573 clusters (default\nparameters were used as suggested by the authors of\nCAP3), yielding 7,712 sequences with unique cDNA\nsequences. The median length of these assembled cDNAs\nis 847 nucleotides (with mean of 862 nt), the shortest\nbeing 20 nucleotides, and longest being 3,227 nucle-\notides. Figure 2A compares the distribution of the\nsequence length before and after the sequence assembly.\nWe next translated the 7,712 assembled cDNA sequences\ninto six possible open reading frames (ORFs), and\nselected the largest ORF for each sequence. Figure 2B\nshows that 3,248 cDNA sequences contain ORFs that are\nlonger than 100 amino acids, which is a strong indication\nthat these cDNAs cover protein coding regions.\nComparison with previously published L. stagnalis EST \nsequences\nPreviously, Davison and Blaxter [33] sequenced a small\nset of ESTs from unnormalized libraries of L. stagnalis CNS\nand the EST set contained 1,320 sequences with an aver-\nage length of 665 nt. Using these data as query we\nsearched for homology hits in our cDNA library. Using a\nstringent cutoff requiring sequence identity of at least\n90% and a minimum alignment length of 30 nucleotides,\n509 (38.6%) sequences in our library have a hit in the pre-\nvious library, and 711 (54%) of the sequences in the ear-\nlier library have a hit in ours. These differences may be\naccounted for 1) by the sizes of the libraries used, and 2)\nthe previous ESTs may include redundant sequences.\nComparison with NCBI non-redundant protein and \nnucleotide sequence libraries\nWe next ran BLASTx searches (using translated nucle-\notides as a query to search against protein sequence\nlibrary) and mapped the L. stagnalis cDNA sequences to\nthe NCBI (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/; up to May,\n2009) non-redundant protein library (nr), which is com-\nmonly used as the principle target database to search for\nprotein homologies. This database was constructed by\npooling the sequences from the following databases, fol-\nlowed by clustering and removing redundant entries:\ntranslated protein coding region of all the sequence\nentries in the GenBank, RefSeq database (high quality\nproteins from human and mouse), PDB (protein structure\ndatabase), SwissProt, PIR (Protein Information Source),\nPRF (Protein Research Foundation).\nIn addition, we carried out BLAST searches against the\nNCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequence data base (nt),\nwhich stores all the nucleotide sequences submitted to\nGenBank to account for the possibility that some of the\nshorter cDNA sequences were derived from 3' or 5'\nuntranslated regions (UTR) of mRNA transcripts instead\nof mapping to the protein coding region. This also covers\ncDNAs that are derived from non-coding RNA transcripts\nsuch as rRNA.\nThe results of these two BLAST searches are plotted in Fig-\nure 3. For each e-value cutoff, we divided the L. stagnalis\nsequences into four categories: (i) having a hit in \"nr (pro-\ntein)\" but not in \"nt (nucleotide)\", (ii) having a hit in\nboth \"nr\" and \"nt\", (iii) having a hit in \"nt\" but not in\n\"nr\", and (iv) having a hit in neither \"nr\" nor \"nt\". Our\nprediction was that the third category likely represents 3'\nor 5' UTRs or noncoding RNA transcripts. A closer inspec-\ntion of the reads in category (iii) revealed that most of\nthese reads that actually map to EST or cDNA sequences in\n\"nt\" do not have a corresponding entry in \"nr\", mostly\nbecause that these nt sequences are either too short or do\nnot contain an open reading frame. The fourth category,\non the other hand, likely represents novel sequences that\nonly exist in L. stagnalis. However, it is also possible that\nsome of the sequences in this category are reads from the\n5' or 3' UTRs or from non-coding transcripts.

Even\nat an e-value cutoff of 0.001, 52% (3,930) of L. stagnalis\ncDNA sequences longer than 100 bases (Figure 3A) and\n50% (3,630) of cDNA sequences longer than 500 bases\n(Figure 3B) have no significant BLAST matches in the non-\nredundant protein and nucleotide databases. This is likely\ncaused by the relatively low coverage of DNA or genomic\nsequences from the Mollusca phylum in the current\nsequence databases, including the A. californica and B. gla-\nbrata EST databases.\nWe next investigated the phylogenetic distribution of the\ntop BLAST hits. For each L. stagnalis cDNA, we found the\nphylum of its best BLAST match, and then catalogued the\nbest matches according to their phylogenetic origin and\ncounted the matches for each phylum. Table 1 shows the\nfrequency of the matches with an e-value cutoff 1e-10 as\nused by Moroz et al (2006) [38]. The hits to chordate\nsequences are significantly higher than the other phyla,\nincluding Lophotrochozoan. However, this raises a ques-\ntion about the usefulness of such an analysis for sequence\nmapping as the frequency of hits is obviously associated\nwith the number of the sequences available in the data-\nbase. The number of sequences from each of the meta-\nzoan phyla in the database is largely variable as the\ndifferent phyla are not all equally covered. Thus, such a\npresentation has the potential to introduce a serious bias\ntowards phyla that are better presented in the databases.\nComparison with A. californica sequences\nA. californica is currently the only other mollusk species\nfor which an effort has been made to obtain the complete\nCNS transcriptome sequences [38]. To better understand\nthe sequence diversity between these mollusk species, we\ncompared the L. stagnalis cDNA sequences (7712\nsequences with an average length of 862 nucleotides) with\nthe EST sequences from A. californica reported by Moroz et\nal [38]. The published A. californica EST dataset includes\n199,689 sequences surveyed from a wide range of tissues,\nwith an average length of 563 nucleotides. Table 2 pro-\nvides data on the cumulative populations of hits between\nthe L. stagnalis and A. californica ESTs. We first conducted\nthe Blastn analysis between the two datasets. At e-value\ncutoff of 1E-6, approximately 13% of the L. stagnalis\ncDNAs has a BLASTn hit in the A. californica EST library,\nand approximately 6% of the A. californica library has a\nmatch in this L. stagnalis cDNA library (Table 2). At a less\nstringent e-value cutoff of 0.01, hits for an additional ~7%\nof the L. stagnalis cDNAs were found in the A. californica\nTable 1: Phylogenetic distribution of the top hits in the NCBI nr library\nPhylogenetic group Number of cDNAs\n(e-value < 1e-10)\nChordata 944\nArthropoda (e.g. insects and Crustaceans) 562\nLophotrochozoan, including Mollusca, Annelida (segmented worms) 302\nEchinodermata 273\nCnidaria (e.g. Hydra and jelly fish) 212\nNematoda (including C. elegans) 57\nPlatyzoa 47\nBacteria 46\nPlants 41\nFungi 33\nTotal 2583Page 6 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:451 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/451EST library, and an additional ~7% of the A. californica\nlibrary produced hits in this L. stagnalis cDNA library\n(Table 2). Because these two species are distantly related\norganisms, the low hits resulted from our Blastn analysis\nmay be simply due to the difference in their genetic codes.\nWe thus carried out a tblastx analysis to search a translated\nnucleotide database using a translated nucleotide query.\nAs presented in Table 2, at e-value cutoff of 1e-6, the\ntblastx hits of L. stagnalis ESTs in A. californica database\nreached 28.9%, whilst the percentage of tblastx hits of A.\ncalifornica sequences in the L. stagnalis EST database was\n11.9%. Taking together, these data indicate a relative low\npercentage of matches between A. californica and L. stagna-\nlis EST sequences.\nIt is possible that some of these L. stagnalis cDNAs are not\nexpressed at high levels in A. californica and are not detect-\nable in the transcriptome studies; therefore we compared\nthe L. stagnalis cDNA sequences against the A. californica\ngenomic trace files, downloaded from NCBI GenBank.

Another possible explanation for the relatively low\nmatch between L. stagnalis and A. californica could be that\na large proportion of corresponding ESTs match to differ-\nent parts of the same (orthologous) mRNAs and are there-\nfore not identified as a match. To test this we took the\n1,074 L. stagnalis ESTs with a best scoring match to NCBI\nnr and ran the respective NCBI nr match sequences\nagainst the A. californica EST database using a tBLASTx\nsearch. We expected that orthologous non-overlapping\nESTs from both species would thus be bridged by their\ncorresponding longer NCBI nr sequence match. Surpris-\ningly only ~0.2% (2 out of 1074) of the L. stagnalis ESTs\ncould be matched with an A. californica EST with an e-\nvalue \u2264 0.01. Although there are several limitations with\nrespect to comparing EST datasets, especially when they\nare relatively small in size, these findings together seem to\nsuggest that there is high sequence divergence between A.\ncalifornica and L. stagnalis.\nComparison with Biomphalaria glabrata sequences\nThe freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata (B. glabrata)\nbelongs to the family Planorbidae of the pulmonate gas-\ntropod mollusk. Recently the whole genome sequencing\nof B. glabrata has been completed http:\/\/\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/\nwwwtax.cgi?id=6526, however, the trace sequences have\nnot yet been assembled. Currently, there are 19,523 EST\nsequences of various B. glabrata tissues, not limited to the\nCNS, deposited into the GenBank. We thus compared the\nB. glabrata EST sequences with our L. stagnalis EST\nsequences. Our blastn and tblastx analyses are shown in\nTable 4. At e-value cutoff of 1e-6, the rate of Blastn hits of\nL. stagnalis ESTs in B. glabrata database was ~5% and the\nrate of tblastx hits was ~11%. In contrast, the Blastn hits\nof B. glabrata ESTs in our L. stagnalis database was ~12%\nand the tblastx hits were ~17%. These results indicate 1)\nthat there is a significant level of redundancy in the B. gla-\nbrata EST library because many B. glabrata ESTs match to\nthe same L. stagnalis sequences; 2) there is a relative low\nmatch between B. glabrata and L. stagnalis EST sequences,\nsuggesting a substantial difference between the transcrip-\ntomes of the two animals.\nComparison with other model organisms\nWe investigated the occurrence of the L. stagnalis cDNAs in\nthree different organisms: the model organisms nematode\nworm (C. elegans) and fruitfly (D. melanogaster), and\nhuman. We ran BLAST searches against the combined pro-\ntein, mRNA, and noncoding RNA libraries in worm, fruit-\nfly and human respectively; the results are shown in\nFigure 4. As seen in Figure 4A, with an e-value cutoff at 1e-\n6, 1,694 L. stagnalis cDNA sequences have a BLAST hit to\na protein, an mRNA, or a RNA sequence in worm; 1,915\ncDNAs have a hit in fly, and 2,065 cDNAs have a hit in\nhuman. Remarkably, 70% (5463) of the cDNAs do not\nhave any BLAST hit in any of these three organisms. Simi-\nlar results are shown in Figure 4B, with a BLAST cutoff at\n0.01. In this case, 54% (4,179) of the cDNA sequences do\nnot have any BLAST hit. This relatively low concordance\nreflects the substantial evolutionary distance between L.\nstagnalis and the three species from different animal\nphyla.\nGene Ontology Mapping\nWe mapped the cDNA sequences to the UniProt protein\ndatabase, since this is the only comprehensive database\nfor which GO annotation data is available. Using the e-\nvalue cutoff of 1e-6, 2,242 (29%) sequences can be\nmapped to a UniProt entry; using an e-value of 1e-10,\n2,038 (26%) can be mapped to a UniProt entry. We iden-\ntified the corresponding Gene Ontology entries mapped\nto GOslim terms by using the tools provided by the GOA\nwebsite http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/GOA\/. Table 5 shows the\nmost frequently occurring GO functional categories.\nAlignment of known presynaptic genes\nWe identified a number of genes from the L. stagnalis\nlibrary that are functionally related to presynaptic activity\nand other neuronal functions. We then generated multi-\nple sequence alignments of these L. stagnalis proteins with\ntheir orthologous genes from other species and generated\nthe corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 5, 6, and 7).\nTable 4: Blast hits in the B. glabrata EST library using the L. stagnaliscDNA as query\nBlast E-value Number of L. stagnalis ESTs having a blast hit in B. \nglabrata library\nNumber of B. glabrata ESTs having a blast hit in L. \nstagnalis\nBlastn Tblastx Blastn Tblastx\n1e-10 307 (4%) 682 (8.8%) 2098 (10.7%) 2689 (13.8%)\n1e-6 375 (4.9%) 868 (11.3%) 2372 (12.1%) 3378 (17.3%)\n1e-03 594 (7.7%) 1288 (16.7%) 3244 (16.6%) 4891 (25.1%)Page 8 of 15\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:451 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/451We found that, as expected, the L. stagnalis sequences are\nmost closely related to their orthologs in A. californica.\nTypical examples are the clathrin adaptor-protein com-\nplex 2 (AP-2) mu-1 subunit and the clathrin AP-1 theta-1\nsubunit shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively. The\nphylogenetic trees clearly show the conservation of these\nproteins across species. The L. stagnalis orthologue is more\nclosely related to A. californica than other invertebrates\nand is distant from vertebrates. Intriguingly, L. stagnalis\nhas an ortholog of the vertebrate syntaxin 7 gene, but its\nequivalent has so far not been found in the A. californica\nlibrary (Figure 7).\nDiscussion\nIn summary, we reported in this study the CNS expressed\ncDNA sequences of 5376 randomly selected clones from a\nnormalized CNS cDNA library, thus providing what is\ncurrently the largest database of L. stagnalis cDNA\nsequences. Because molluscan species have not been fre-\nquently used in the sequencing projects, this is currently\nthe second largest CNS transcriptome study in the entire\nMollusca phylum. Although the transcriptome informa-\ntion is far from complete, we found only ~25% BLAST hits\nof L. stagnalis cDNA sequences in A. californica sequences,\nwhich suggests substantial genetic differences between\nthese two gastropod mollusks. This argues for further large\nscale sequencing of L. stagnalis that will shed light on the\nextent of diversification of the genome in both molluscan\nspecies.\nNormalized cDNA library\nIn this study we used a normalized cDNA library to reduce\nthe high variation among the abundant clones, thus\nincreasing the probability of sequencing rare transcripts\n[40]. We found that over 90% of the sequences are\nbetween 700 and 1000 bp long, indicating the overall\ngood quality of the sequencing processes. We have\nsequenced 5376 clones and obtained 10,375 EST\nsequences which cluster to 7,712 unique sequences. The\ncomparison between our library and the previous pub-\nlished Lymnaea EST sequences generated from a non-nor-\nmalized library [33] showed that 509 (38.6%) sequences\nin our library have a hit in the previous library, and 711\n(54%) of the sequences in the earlier library have a hit in\nours. The higher percentage of hits using the previous\nlibrary to search the present ESTs is likely due to that 1)\nthe previous sequencing of an unnormalized EST library\nincludes a large proportion of redundant sequences; and\n2) this study sequenced ESTs from normalized libraries\nwhich reduces the probability of redundant sequences,\nand thus yielded a higher coverage. In addition, the previ-\nous library comprised sequences from the 5' end of tran-\nscripts, whereas the present EST database includes a mix of\n5' and 3' sequences. It thus is also possible that a propor-\ntion of sequences of the previous ESTs generate more than\none hit in our database.\nNovel transcripts in L. stagnalis \nIt is intriguing that a large proportion of the L. stagnalis\ncDNAs contain novel sequences that apparently have no\nsignificant match in any of the existing databases.

Many of these novel\ntranscripts can also be translated into long sequences of\namino acids. For example one cDNA (Contig 596; Supple-\nmentary Material, http:\/\/www.Lymnaea.org\/) has 3216\nnucleotides containing 505 consecutively translated\namino acids. Interestingly, the closest sequence homolog\nfor this sequence is a RNA polymerase in potato\n(gi|68124015|emb|CAJ01915.1| DNA-directed RNA\npolymerase [Solanum tuberosum]). Nevertheless, the large\ncollection of gene sequences identified in this study\ninclude structural proteins, heat shock proteins, transcrip-\ntion factors, ion channels, receptors, and protein kinases.\nAlignment and phylogenetic trees\nWe have aligned a number of presynaptic protein\nsequences from L. stagnalis to those of other model organ-\nisms. The L. stagnalis presynaptic protein sequences tested\nhere are highly homologous to other species, consistent\nwith the notion that both invertebrates and vertebrates\nshare similar molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmis-\nsion (see [41]). Interestingly, we identified a syntaxin 7\nsequence in the L. stagnalis CNS transcriptome. Syntaxin 7\nis one of the endosomal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleim-\nide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) proteins\nthat may be involved in a conserved late endosomal\nfusion pathway [42,43]. Notably, this protein has so far\nnot been reported in A. californica.\nOur results demonstrate that the L. stagnalis CNS tran-\nscriptome data complement the transcriptome sequenc-\ning project of A. californica [38]. Based on the A. californica\nCNS sequence data, we expect a total of ~20,000 neuronal\ngene products in the L. stagnalis CNS. We currently\nobtained 2,406 transcripts corresponding to known bio-\nlogical processes. These annotated transcripts contribute\n12% of the predicted transcriptome size. The hits of L.\nstagnalis sequences to the A. californica transcriptome are\n~29% (e-value: 1E-6; tblastx), and an additional 9% were\nfound to match A. californica sequences with an e-value\ncutoff at 0.01. Amongst 7712 L. stagnalis sequences tested,\nover 97% (7484 out of 7712 sequences) of them have\nlengths greater than 300 nucleotides, and over 42% (3248\nout of 7712) sequences contain ORFs that are longer than\n100 amino acids. Assuming that the A. californica EST set\nhas a good coverage [38], it is a somewhat low match\nwhich indicates the possibility that the CNS transcriptome\nsequences of the two species are considerably different.\nAlthough both species are classified as heterobranches\n[44] within the gastropods, the two branches diverged\nover 600 million years ago. Thus it is not surprising to see\nthese apparently large transcriptome sequence variations\nbetween these two species. However, our sequencing\neffort comprises only a fraction of the neuronal transcrip-\ntome and a larger scale sequencing project is required in\norder to make a full comparison between these two spe-\ncies.\nConclusion\nThis study currently provides the largest database of L.\nstagnalis CNS EST sequences, and demonstrates the substan-\ntial genetic differences between two gastropod mollusks,\nL. stagnalis and A. californica.

Animals were kept in water at 20\u00b0C\nunder a 12 hr light\/dark cycle, and fed green leaf lettuce\ntwice a week. Two-month old snails having shell lengths\nof 15 to 20 mm were used in this study. Specifically, the\nsnails were anesthetized with 10% (v\/v) Listerine for 10\nmin. The central ring ganglia and attached buccal ganglia\nwere dissected out and prepared for total RNA extraction.\nThree central ring ganglia were used for total RNA extrac-\ntion.\ncDNA synthesis and cDNA library normalization\ncDNA synthesis and normalization were carried out by\nBio S&T Inc. (Montreal, QC, Canada). Specifically, total\nRNA was extracted from snail ganglia using the modified\nTrizol method (Invitrogen, USA). Purification of mRNA\nwas carried out using Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, USA),\nand cDNA synthesis using the SMART\u2122 cDNA library con-\nstruction kit (Clontech, USA). The clones contain SfiI-A\nand SfiI-B restriction sites, which allowed directional\ncloning. Full-length cDNA was synthesized with two set of\nprimers for driver and tester cDNA. Single-stranded cDNA\nwas used for hybridization instead of double-stranded\ncDNA [40]. Excess amount of sense-stranded cDNA was\nhybridized with antisense-stranded cDNA. After hybridi-\nzation, duplex structures were removed by hydroxyapatite\nchromatography. Normalized tester cDNA was re-ampli-\nfied with the tester specific primer L4N without amplifica-\ntion of the driver cDNA that cannot be amplified using the\nL4N primer.\ncDNA normalization efficiency was strictly monitored by\nBio S & T Inc. (Montreal, QC, Canada). Specifically a par-\nallel normalization of an internal control was performed\nin addition to the normalization of the cDNA population.\nIn the parallel normalization, a modified reporter gene\n(chloramphenicol resistance gene with same adaptor-\nprimer sequences) was added to the cDNA population\nbefore normalization at a desired redundancy rate (e.g.\n1.0%) as a control. cDNA was cloned using a modified\npBluescript SK-vector (MBI-Fermentas, Canada). Because\npBluescript is ampicillin resistant, the percentage of this\ncontrol gene is determined before and after normaliza-\ntion. The frequency of chloramphenicol resistant clones\nwas determined and used to estimate the reduction during\nnormalization. In this study, reduction was 40\u00d7.\nFollowing normalization, ss-cDNA were amplified by\nPCR and purified. Re-amplified cDNAs were then sub-\njected to SfiI digestion and size fractionation in a 1% aga-\nrose gel. cDNA fragments larger than 0.5 Kb were purified\nfor cloning. The cloning vector was a modified pBluescrip-\ntII SK-with SfiI A&B inserts between EcoRI and XhoI. The\nligated cDNAs were then transformed into DH10B (Invit-\nrogen, USA). The clones were arrayed in a one clone\/well\nformat and amplified by overnight culture. The average\ninsert size was 1.5 kb based on a test sample of 20 random\nclones. cDNA clones were prepared as glycerol stock in\n384-well plates for sequencing.\nDNA Sequencing\nDouble-end cDNA sequencing was carried out by the\nGenome Sciences Centre at the British Columbia Cancer\nAgency (Vancouver, BC, Canada) using the Sanger\nsequencing method. For sequencing of 5'-ends, T3 (or\nM13F) primer was used; for sequencing of 3'-ends, T7 (or\nM13R) primer was used. The sequences listed are all in the\nforward strand, 5' to 3'.\nSequence analysis and bioinformatics\nThe raw cDNA sequences were subjected to 5'-trimming to\neliminate the vector and 3'-trimming to eliminate low\nquality portions. The sequences were then clustered and\nassembled into 7712 sequences using the program CAP3\n[39]. We used the BLAST program [46] to search for\nhomology sequences in the following sequence databases:\nNCBI non-redundant protein (nr) and nucleotide (nt)\ndatabases, Swissprot protein database, and EST databases\nincluding the previously published EST library of A. cali-\nfornica [38]. We wrote PERL scripts to conduct the subse-\nquent bioinformatic analyses (available upon request).\nAuthors' contributions\nZPF and NN carried out the molecular genetic studies; ZZ\nconducted the bioinformatics analysis; ZPF, ZZ, and NN\nparticipated in the sequence alignment; ZPF and ZZ\ndrafted the manuscript; ZPF, ZZ, REVK, VAS, RPC, and\nABS participated in producing the final version of the\nmanuscript. KJ developed the sequence database. ZPF,\nREVK, NIS, and ABS participated in the design of the\nstudy. ZPF, NIS and ABS conceived of the study, and ZPF\ncoordinated the study.
