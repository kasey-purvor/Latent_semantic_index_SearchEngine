Hybrid spintronic devices re-\nquire the growth of ferromagnetic films onto semiconductors\nfor spin injection. The choice of semiconductor is governed\nby whether mobility or spin lifetime is maximized; narrow-\ngap III-V\u2019s ~Ref. 6! seem promising in the former case, and\nSi ~Ref. 7! in the latter. However, the NiMnSb:semiconduc-\ntor system is challenging to work with because ~i! transport\nspin polarization8 (Pt) drops dramatically with a few percent\natomic disorder,9 ~ii! Pt drops at the free surface due to sur-\nface reconstruction,10,11 and ~iii! it has been reported12 that\nthe true half-metallic state in NiMnSb only persists up to 80\nK. Optimizing properties, particularly M S and Pt , is critical\nto the realization of hybrid spintronic devices.\nThe drive to continually increase data storage densities\nhas sustained interest in magnetoresistance ~MR! materials,\nparticularly giant MR multilayers13 and colossal MR\nmanganites.14 In these materials the magnetic field ~H! aligns\nthe magnetic moments, which reduces the resistance. This is\ntermed \u2018\u2018negative magnetoresistance.\u2019\u2019 Recently, magnetore-\nsistances of comparable,15 or greater,16 magnitude to the\nCMR materials but opposite ~positive! sign have been re-\nported. In composite heterostructures16 the MR is a geomet-\nric effect, caused by magnetic deflection of the current path.\nIn the nonmagnetic silver chalcogenides,15,17 Ag26dX (X\n5Se,Te), the magnetic field increases the intrinsic resistivity\nof the material through band-gap tuning,18,19 with the maxi-\nmum in the magnetoresistance, and a linear field depen-\ndence, found at the crossover from hole-dominated to\nelectron-dominated transport. In doped FeSi ferromagnets,20\nthe positive MR is associated with weak localization21,22 in\ndisordered metals. In Ti:Si films,23 the positive MR vanishes\nbelow the sharp resistivity minimum.\nRecently, it has been shown24 that a number of metallic\nHeusler alloys show a low temperature upturn in the resis-\ntivity, and are best described as strongly disordered electron\nsystems, rather than conventional metals. Here we report the\nobservation of a positive giant magnetoresistance in thin\nfilms of nonstoichiometric NiMnSb that is coupled to a low-\ntemperature upturn in the resistivity.

All films were shown by energy\ndispersive x-ray analysis to be nonstoichiometric, formulated\nNi11xMn12ySb, (x50.1560.05,y50.1560.05). There was\nno systematic variation of stoichiometry between films of\ndifferent thickness. The x-ray diffraction ~XRD! pattern was\nconsistent with a NiMnSb half-Heusler phase with the lattice\nparameter 5.99 \u00c560.02 \u00c5, compared to 5.9320 \u00c5\n60.0028 \u00c5 for the target, and no second phase was ob-\nserved. The magnetic properties of the 45, 110, and 390 nm\nfilms were measured from 5 to 300 K in a Quantum Design\nSQUID magnetometer ~a reliable signal could not be ob-\ntained for the 5 nm film!. These three films had saturation\nmagnetizations (M S;2mB \/f.u.) and the Curie temperatures\nwere significantly reduced from the target (M S\n;3.2mB \/f.u.;TC5744 K).\nMagnetotransport data was collected in a van der Pauw\ngeometry. The zero-field resistivity of the series of films is\nshown in Fig. 1~a!, which is dominated by the sharp upturn\nin the resistivity of the 5 nm sample below 150 K. The inset\nshows the temperature dependence of the other films. The\nresistivity upturn systematically decreases with increasing\nfilm thickness, and the 390 nm film does not show an\nupturn. In the thickest film the resistance ratio is\n@r(290 K)\/r(50 K)51.2# . This shows that the transport is\nstill inequivalent to bulk polycrystals,12 where\n@r(290 K)\/r(50 K)52.5# and the MR is negative. The tem-\nperature dependence of the MR, defined as @R(H)\n2R(0 T)#\/R(0 T), in an applied field of 1.9 T, perpendicular\nto the film surface, is plotted in Fig. 1~b!. For all the films the\nMR is positive, with a maximum coincident in temperature\nand minimum in the resistivity. The 390 nm film is an ex-\nception because it shows a broad maximum in the MR of\n10.5% around 150 K, but no minimum is observed in the\nresistivity. The inset to Fig. 1~b! shows I(V) curves of the 5\nnm film, taken at temperatures with the same resistance on\neither side of the resistivity minimum, 140 and 225 K. Below\nthe resistivity upturn, the I(V) curve deviates from Ohm\u2019s\nlaw for currents above 500 mA, indicating a profound change\nin the transport mechanism below the upturn.\nTo test whether anisotropic magnetoresistance ~AMR!\nplays a significant role, the dependence of the large MR on\nfield orientation was measured. When the field was applied\nparallel to the film surface, the MR was found to be slightly\nenhanced relative to the perpendicular MR, and was not af-\nfected by whether the current was perpendicular or parallel\nto the field direction. Hence, AMR does not significantly\ncontribute.\nThe high-field and low-temperature behavior of the MR\nof the 5 nm sample is shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that\nthis data was collected with fresh contacts on a different\ninstrument, and does not correspond exactly with those\nshown in Figs. 1 and 2. The field dependence of the MR has\ntwo regimes. In the low-field regime it varies as H2 at all\ntemperatures, whereas in the high-field regime the field de-\npendence is clearly changing with temperature. The solid\nlines in Fig. 2 show a fit of the high field (H.2 T) data to\nMR5MR01aHn and the inset shows the fitted value of ex-\nponent n as a function of temperature. The exponent is less\nthan unity at temperatures below the resistivity upturn, and\ngreater than unity above the upturn. The maximum in the\nMR occurs at the upturn temperature, where n51.\nBetween 50 and 150 K, the field dependence of the MR\nis superficially similar to the disorder-induced weak localiza-\ntion model.21,22,25 However, this model predicts an H\n1\n2 de-\npendence in the high field limit, and H2 at low field, with the\ntheoretical crossover point around H5kT\/gmB which corre-\nsponds to H575 T at 100 K ~assuming g52). The fit of the\n100 K MR with n51\/2 for H>2 T ~Fig. 2! shows that the\ncrossover occurs at around 2 T. Furthermore, the plot of the\nexponent with temperature in the inset to Fig. 2 shows that\nthe exponent of H is slowly increasing with temperature, and\nis coincidentally close to H1\/2 around 100 K. The model\ncannot predict either the crossover field or the temperature\ndependence of the exponent, and seems inappropriate for this\nFIG. 1. ~a!

This linear, maximum\nMR was found to occur when the number of electrons and\nholes was equal,26,19 as demonstrated by a sign reversal in\nthe Hall coefficient. The similarities between the NiMnSb\nfilms and the chalcogenides merit a Hall investigation. How-\never, in NiMnSb, the Hall analysis will not be transparent\nbecause of the anomalous Hall term, and the Fermi surface\ncontains both holelike sheets and an electronlike sphere.4\nTwo-carrier Hall analysis is not straightforward.27\nThe MR is clearly linked to the low temperature upturn\nin the resistivity. The upturns in the 5 and 80 nm samples\nwere fitted to a number of potential models, as has been\nreported28 for disordered Ni0.5Al0.5 alloys. The variable range\nhopping, weak localization, and Kondo mechanisms result in\nupturns that follow (1\/T)1\/4, T1\/2, and ln T, respectively. This\nfitting procedure was not conclusive for these films, although\nthe Kondo model was clearly inappropriate. Figure 3 shows\nfits to the other two models. The fit to the variable range-\nhopping model is shown for the 80 and 5 nm films in Figs.\n3~a! and 3~b!, respectively, and fits to the weak localization\nmodel for the 80 and 5 nm films in Figs. 3~c! and 3~d!,\nrespectively. The two models give reasonable fits of similar\nquality for the 80 nm sample. The 5 nm sample can be fitted\nreasonably with the (T1\/2) weak localization model, and not\nat all with the (1\/T)1\/4 variable range-hopping model. Only\nthe weak localization model gives a reasonable fit for both\nfilms. However, this model gave a poor description of the\nfield dependence of the MR of the 5 nm sample. The upturn\nin the 5 nm sample is so much more dramatic than that of the\nother samples that it is not clear whether the same mecha-\nnism dominates the resistivity of all the films, or whether\nanother mechanism is operating in the thinnest sample. In-\ndeed nonlinearity in the I-V curve of the 5 nm film below the\nupturn @inset to Fig. 1~b!# is suggestive of percolative behav-\nior in this sample.\nIn summary, we report a giant positive magnetoresis-\ntance that increases with decreasing thickness in nonstoichio-\nmetric NiMnSb:Si films, and is greater than 100% for the 5\nnm film at 200 K in 8 T. The temperature of the maximum in\nthe magnetoresistance corresponds to the minimum in the\nresistivity. There is a further, small enhancement of the MR\nwhen the field is applied parallel to the film surface. The\nevolution of the field dependence of the magnetoresistance\nappears similar to the silver chalcogenides, and is indicative\nof a crossover from hole-dominated to electron-dominated\ntransport as the temperature increases.\nThe authors thank Mark Ellerby ~UCL! for access to\nSQUID magnetometry and acknowledge the E.U. program\nG5RD-CT-2001 for funding.\n1 F.
