For operations \nmanagement researchers interested in product development, the study furthers our understanding of \nlearning in NPD, indicates topics that need further investigation, and suggests suitable \nmethodologies. For practitioners, the results indicate the potential for more effective team learning \nin NPD. \n \nKeywords: new product development, post-project reviews, project management \n \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nManagers responsible for new product development (NPD) need to constantly improve their \nprocesses and strengthen core R&D capabilities (Wheelwright & Clark, 1992). A post-project \nreview is, \u201ca formal review of the project which examines the lessons which may be learnt and used \nto the benefit of future projects\u201d (Lane, 2000) and such reviews are a potentially valuable method to \ncapture the knowledge generated during the course of a NPD project. The importance of post-\nproject reviews (PPRs) is frequently stressed by practitioners and academics, but rigorous research \ninto how they are typically conducted, are perceived, or how learning occurs, is scarce.  \n  Companies rarely conduct PPRs\u23afas shown by a wide body of anecdotal evidence (e.g. Tidd et \nal, 1997) and a few empirical studies (e.g. Bowen et al, 1994; Huber, 1996; Saban et al, 2000). An \nopportunity for learning is lost when PPRs are not used and this can result in companies making \nvery similar mistakes to those made in previous NPD projects (Tidd et al, 1997). \nThis paper describes how NPD personnel perceive PPRs and this is important because only if \nthey are positively perceived, will the necessary motivation for learning be present. The research \nalso investigated the role of social interactions and tacit knowledge in NPD. The scope of the \nliterature that should be considered relevant to the study of PPRs is a salient point. Both the project \nmanagement and NPD literature give useful pointers. The organizational learning literature is also \nrelevant but, surprisingly, most researchers working in the NPD context have failed to apply this \nknowledge (McKee, 1992). In this paper we review all three literatures to identify gaps in the extant \nknowledge and gain insights into suitable methodologies. Next, we explain the choice of \nmethodology and the actions taken to ensure validity. The results are then presented and the \nimplications for practitioners and academics are identified, including ideas for further research. \n2 \n \nREVIEW OF THE EXTANT LITERATURE \nProject Management Literature \nIt was in the 1950s that the need to review the performance of projects was first recognized, at the \nsame time as project management was emerging as a discipline (Weinberg and Freedman, 1984). \nLater, recommendations appeared on how to conduct reviews at the end of a project (e.g. Gulliver, \n1987) and the advantages of PPRs became apparent. However, it has been identified that a \nlimitation of the project management literature on PPRs is that most previous studies have not been \nconducted in a systematic fashion and so the validity of the recommendations is questionable \n(Koners and Goffin, 2005). \nThe literature identifies three main issues about PPRs. Firstly, much can be learnt from \nprevious projects and this can help prevent similar mistakes being made again (Pitman, 1991). \nSecondly, disseminating the lessons learned across the organization is of critical importance (Ayas, \n1996). This can be achieved by using databases of lessons learned, rotating personnel, and \ncirculating written reports (Balthazor, 1994; Holtshouse, 1999). Thirdly, each and every project \nneeds to contribute to the continuous improvement of the organization\u2019s processes (Prahalad and \nHamel, 1990). However, the adoption of PPRs has been slow. \nThere are a number of recommendations in the literature on how best to conduct PPRs (e.g. \nBaird et al, 1999; Busby, 1999; Freedman & Weinberg, 1977; Schindler & Eppler, 2003). However, \nmany of these are vague including \u201cdiscourage glib categorization\u201d (a recommendation given but \nnot explained by Busby [1999]). Others are more specific. For example, Schindler and Eppler \n(2003) suggest a \u201cproject knowledge broker\u201d should be responsible for transferring the lessons \nlearnt within and between project teams. Such mechanisms are necessary as there are many \nindividual and organizational barriers to learning in NPD.  \nThe fact that few organizations conduct PPRs is the result of various factors. The pressure of \ncurrent projects leads to a lack of time to reflect on past projects (Kotnour, 1999). Managers may be \nuncertain as to whether they can learn from project experiences (Boudes et al, 1998). Reviews often \nsuffer from the reluctance of participants to critically evaluate performance, although most people \ngenuinely want to review past projects (Gulliver, 1987). Experiences and insights from projects \nmay be hard to share and difficult to capture in reports and databases (Durrance, 1998). \n \nNPD Literature \nKnowledge has become recognized as a key source of long-term competitive advantage in R&D \n(Corso et al, 2001). Consequently, the importance of learning from NPD projects is made by several \nauthors (e.g. Bowen et al, 1994; Leonard-Barton, 1992; Liyanage et al, 1999). However, there has \nonly been sparse application of the principles of learning theory to empirical studies of the NPD \nprocess\u2014there is a need for more research into how learning can improve product development \n(Saban et al, 2000). Such learning can take place at the individual and organizational levels and \nthere are many barriers to successful learning in NPD teams (Lindkvist, 2001). \nIt has been identified that PPRs are seldom used (Bourgault and Sicotte, 1998; Bowen et al, \n1994; Wheelwright & Clark, 1992) but there have been few empirical studies of this topic. One \nstudy showed that only two out of 33 microelectronic manufacturers use formal PPRs (Boag and \nRinholm, 1989). Goffin and Pfeiffer (1999) found that only four of their 16 case study companies \nused PPRs but failed to give details on how they were used. A survey of 63 NPD managers \nidentified that only 3% of their organizations conduct a review after every project but the majority \n(94%) think their organizations should conduct PPRs (von Zedtwitz, 2003).  \nThere are a number of papers which give recommendations of how to run PPRs (e.g. Duarte \nand Snyder, 1997; Lilly and Porter, 2003; Smith, 1996; Wheelwright and Clark, 1992). These are \noften based on small samples, or the personal experience of the authors. Similar to the project \nmanagement literature, the recommendations given are seldom based on empirical data and so it is \n3 \nunclear how valid they are (Koners and Goffin, 2006). Moreover, the focus of the NPD literature is \non knowledge that can be written down, documented and easily shared. In our previous research we \ncollated the findings in the literature and then collected empirical data to further the understanding  \nof the characteristics of PPRs that influence their effectiveness. Fourteen different characteristics \n(see Table 1) were identified as pertinent, based on five case studies (Koners and Goffin, 2006). For \nexample, the research showed that the timing of PPRs is important, as are the participants and the \nway in which such a meeting is moderated and the findings disseminated. Although this research \ngives insights into the way in which PPRs should be organized, there are other important issues. For \nexample, there have been no studies of whether NPD professionals who participate in PPRs \nperceive them to be valuable and effective. Such studies are needed, as the motivation of \nindividuals is a necessary but not sufficient condition for learning in NPD teams (Lindkvist, 2001). \n \n \n \nCharacteristics of \nPPRs \nConclusions (based on five case  studies and the literature) \n1. Objective of \nPPRs \n\u2022 Closure is important. \n\u2022 Focus is normally on learning from mistakes \u2013 there is an opportunity to learn from successes. \n\u2022 PPRs support knowledge dissemination and this should be an objective \n2. Timing of PPRs \u2022 Guidelines of about 6 months after market launch are not usually followed due to timing problems or \nother priorities. \n\u2022 Discipline is needed to ensure PPRs happen. \n3. Duration of PPRs \u2022 Length of PPRs varies a lot which is also reflected in the results and depth of discussion  \n4. PPR Participants \u2022 Core team always needs to be present.  \n\u2022 The presence of senior management at the presentation of the results both acts as a motivator and a \nmeans of disseminating the knowledge gained. \n5. Moderation of \nPPRs \n\u2022 The responsibility for running and moderating a PPR is often given to the project manager.  \n\u2022 Using a professional moderator (as used by AppliancesCo) appears to be a more effective way to \nchallenge the team and generate more learning. \n6. PPR Discussion \nMethod \n\u2022 The setting,  the questions asked by the moderator, and the visual aids used all appear to influence the \ndepth of discussion and the learning generated. \n7. Location for PPR \u2022 Separate meeting rooms are always used.  \n\u2022 External rooms are sometimes deliberately chosen to facilitate open discussion and concentration \noutside of the company. \n8. Use of guidelines \nfor PPRs \n\u2022 Only one company uses its guidelines for PPRs, others do not have them, only use the compulsory part \nor do not use them at all. \n9. Preparation of \nPPR \n\u2022 Preparation is largely based on the individual reflection of the team members in advance.  \n\u2022 The moderator and project leader should prepare a specific agenda for the PPR. \n     10. Atmosphere \nduring PPRs \n\u2022 Degree of openness and formality depends on participants and company culture \u201catmosphere\u201d  \n\u2022 Hard to measure but very important. \n     11. Documentation of \nthe results  of \nPPRs \n\u2022 PPR discussions should be documented but more effective dissemination is needed. \n\u2022 A presentation to senior management supports a wider awareness. \n     12. Dissemination of \nPPR results \n\u2022 Results are only received by the project team (i.e. the participants) and senior management. \n\u2022 Limited dissemination outside the project team \u2013 a missed opportunity. \n     13. Creation of action \npoints \n\u2022 Action points are derived by all companies.  \n\u2022 Follow-up is problematic if responsibility is not allocated to project manager. \n     14. Agreement on \nimprovement \nsuggestions \n\u2022 Two companies have a target for the minimum number of improvement suggestions. \n\u2022 All companies document them in their minutes.  \n\u2022 Only one company presents them to the management. \nTable 1: Fourteen Key Characteristics of PPRs (adapted from Koners and Goffin, 2006) \n \nJust as managers\u2019 perceptions of PPRs have been overlooked, so it is that most researchers \nhave ignored learning theory when looking at knowledge creation in NPD (McKee, 1992). The \nwork of Thomke and Fujimoto (2000) recognized the difference between knowledge in R&D that is \n4 \neasy to share and that which is best transferred by close interaction. Thus, their research is at the \nvanguard of applying concepts from organizational learning to NPD but unfortunately it did not \ninvestigate PPRs. \n \nOrganizational Learning  \nThere is a vast body of knowledge on organizational learning but little agreement as to what it \nreally is and how it occurs (Chiva and Allegre, 2005). However, there are two concepts in the \norganizational learning literature that appear particularly relevant to NPD: the understanding of \nknowledge and the importance of social interactions for learning.  \nThe concept of knowledge, and the differences between \u201ctacit\u201d and \u201cexplicit\u201d knowledge \nrelates back to Polanyi (1962) and his famous quote that \u201cwe can know more than we can tell\u201d. \nExplicit knowledge is what we can readily explain and document, whereas tacit knowledge is \ndifficult to articulate and exists at a subconscious level. Although it is possible to distinguish \ntheoretically between explicit and tacit knowledge, they are hard to differentiate in practice \n(Johanessen et al, 2001; Lam 2000; von Krogh, 1998). It should be noted that there is some \ncontroversy about whether tacit knowledge can be converted into explicit knowledge (Cook and \nBrown, 1999). However, the discussion in the literature has largely been at a theoretical level and \nhas failed to make empirical inroads into the understanding of tacit knowledge  \nStudying tacit knowledge empirically is a problem area (Wong and Radcliffe, 2000). \nConsequently, the main problem with attempting to apply the concepts from the organizational \nlearning literature to NPD is the difficulty to operationalize the constructs. However, metaphors and \nstories have been recognized in the literature as indicators of the generation and exchange of tacit \nknowledge (Cook and Brown, 1999; Nonaka, 1994). In fact, individuals use metaphors to help \nexplain their intuition to themselves and share it with others (Crossan et al, 1999). The existence of \nmetaphors and stories can be taken as evidence for that tacit learning is taking place (Gherardi, \n2000). Despite the recommendations in the literature that metaphors and stories can be used as a \nmeasure, there is a notable absence of empirical work.  \nThe organizational learning literature identifies the importance of social interactions for the \ntransfer of knowledge. Tacit knowledge can only be transferred through detailed discussions among \npeople from similar backgrounds and with common experiences. Communities of Practice (CoPs) \nare groups of people who are informally bound to one another by exposure to a common class of \nproblems (Wenger and Snyder, 2000). This exposure leads to a high degree of common knowledge, \nunderstanding and language, and experience which supports the efficient transfer of knowledge. \nProject teams can be considered an embryonic form of a CoP (Sense and Antoni, 2003). CoPs \ntheory views learning as a social phenomenon and claims that knowledge, particularly tacit \nknowledge, can only be produced and held collectively (Howells, 1996). It should be noted that \nseveral of the characteristics of PPRs shown in Table 1 relate strongly to social interactions (e.g. the \nway such a meeting is moderated, or held in an informal setting). \n \nConclusions on the Literature \nMuch of the literature on PPRs has discussed their importance, identified that few R&D \norganizations use them, and generated recommendations for how they should be organized. Overall, \nthe key conclusions for the current research are: \n\u0083 Although the key characteristics of PPRs have been identified, there are still many aspects about \nthem that warrant detailed investigation; \n\u0083 Both academics and practitioners stress the importance of PPRs but have not investigated \nwhether managers directly involved in NPD perceive them positively. Such an investigation is \nimportant as, without personal motivation of staff, the capacity for learning will be limited; \n\u0083 The tacit dimension of learning in NPD is poorly understood.  \n \n5 \nRESEARCH DESIGN \nLearning can occur at the individual, project team and project-to-project level and more needs to be \nunderstood about the first two before the latter can be adequately investigated. The gaps identified \nin the literature led to an in-depth study of PPRs, covering a range of topics, including the \ncharacteristics of PPRs (Koners and Goffin, 2006) and the type of learning generated. This paper \nfocuses on perceptions of PPRs, including their ability to generate knowledge. It sets out answers to \nthe following research questions:  \n\u0083 How do NPD professionals perceive PPRs? \nTo answer this question we looked at what NPD professionals think of PPRs, what they want to \nachieve through them, how PPRs support learning, and perceptions of ideal outcomes and how \nlearning can be disseminated. \n\u0083 Is tacit knowledge created during PPRs? \nTo answer this we explored for evidence of tacit knowledge. \n \nCase Study Methodology \nBased on the exploratory nature of the research, in-depth case studies were selected. These are \nappropriate when researching complex social phenomena in real-life contexts (Eisenhard, 1989; \nYin, 1994). Furthermore, they allow researchers to look at a wide array of variables and aspects \n(Hartley, 1994). However, we recognized the need to design the cases carefully to ensure sufficient \nrigour, through focusing on construct validity and internal validity.  \n Construct validity was addressed by using operational measures for the different phenomena \nunder study. For example, it was necessary to find appropriate \u201cmeasures\u201d for the occurrence of \ntacit knowledge during PPRs. As tacit knowledge is hard to identify, the usage of metaphors and \nstories was taken as a proxy measure. (The use of metaphors and stories as a proxy measure of tacit \nknowledge in NPD may be controversial and this will be discussed later). Based on the way the \norganizational learning literature stresses the importance of social interaction, the data were also \ncoded for such indications. These included looking for references to the way meetings were held, \nthe atmosphere necessary, the company culture required and the like. \nInternal validity refers to the reliability of a case study and whether the variables chosen for \ninvestigation are sufficient to explain the topic under investigation (Dane, 1990). Therefore, in order \nto maximize internal validity, multiple sources of data were used.  \n \nData Sources \nThe collection of data per case typically required 5 full but non-consecutive days of on-site visits. \nThese were spread over approximately 6 months and took place during the years 2003 to 2005. \nThese visits were used for collecting documents, conducting interviews and observing a PPR. \nFollowing the completion of each case, an extra visit gave specific feedback to the company on its \nprocesses and suggestions for improvements (the feedback component was not part of the formal \nresearch design but was important in gaining the cooperation of the companies). The research was \nconducted by a native German speaker with support from an English native speaker who speaks \nfluent German. Figure 1 shows the data sources and data collection techniques used for the \nresearch. This approach allowed a high degree of data triangulation between the three sources of \ndata: company documents, interviews, and observations of PPRs. \n \nCompany Documents \nCopies of company confidential documents on PPR guidelines and the minutes of specific PPR \nmeetings were obtained. A content analysis was conducted for PPR practices, documented lessons \nlearned as well as metaphors and stories. The data coding recorded in documentation typically \nreflects explicit knowledge;  \n \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Multi-Faceted Design of Case Studies \n \nInterviews with NPD Personnel \nAt each company six interviews were conducted with project participants with different levels of \nexperience in the respective company. All interviewees were managers of NPD projects or were \nactively involved in NPD. The first part of each interview was based on repertory grid technique. \nThis technique is especially useful in exploratory research settings (Goffin, 2002) and has been used \npreviously to understand supplier-manufacturer relationships (Lemke et al, 2003). Repertory grid \ntechnique stimulated interviewees to contrast different projects on which they had worked. This \nelicited the lessons that they perceived to have learned from previous NPD projects. The particular \nadvantage of repertory grid technique is it forces the respondent to think deeply and probes their \ntacit knowledge.  \n The semi-structured part of the interviews was based around the following six questions: \n1) What do NPD professionals think of PPRs? \n2) What do NPD managers want to achieve with a PPR? \n3) How do PPRs support the learning from projects? \n4) What is the ideal outcome of a PPR? \n5) How should PPR results be disseminated? \n6) What are possible alternatives to PPRs? \n \nPPR Observation \nAn actual PPR was observed at four companies (one company refused permission) and this was \nanalyzed using ideas from learning theory. Thus, meeting transcripts were analyzed with a \nparticular focus on lessons learned, metaphors and stories as well as social interactions. \n \nSample \nThe sampling frame chosen was the 50 largest companies in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. This is \nconsidered to be a leading high-tech region because it accounts for the highest number of patents \nand R&D investments per capita in Europe (Staatsministerium Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 2001). \nCompanies from different sectors were chosen, so that direct competitors would not be in the \nsample, which was an important aspect in gaining the co-operation and trust of the companies. The \ncompanies have been given disguised names and Table 2 summarizes the data collected at each site.  \n \nCase study no.

It included cross-checking the data coding \nand ensuring that salient quotes, which often included slang and dialect, were translated \nappropriately into English. There were three stages: \n\u0083 Within-case analysis. Data from each case were analyzed separately to give a complete picture of \neach company\u2019s approach to PPRs. The same analysis framework was used for each case and the \nresearch design ensured that a high degree of data triangulation could be performed. Part of this \nanalysis was the collation of interviewees\u2019 answers to the semi-structured interview questions, \nlooking for evidence of the importance of social interactions. Another vital part of the analysis \nwas the coding of the minutes of PPRs, repertory grid data, and observation transcripts\u2014in all of \nthese the use of metaphors and stories was the proxy measure chosen. \n\u0083 Data reduction. 2-3 page case descriptions were written on each company. The descriptions were \nthen submitted to informants at the case companies to prevent observer bias (Lincoln and Guba, \n1985) and to establish the credibility of the interpretation (Wallendorf and Belk, 1989). \n\u0083 Cross-case analysis. Comparisons across the companies were made, to determine where \nsimilarities and differences existed and to identify a number of \u201cbest practices\u201d (Yin, 1994). \nThese comparisons effectively organized the results into the characteristics of PPRs (reported in \nAuthors, 2006), and perceptions of learning (this paper). Further analysis is planned on the \ntypical lessons learned in PPRs and NPD in general. \n \nRESULTS \nHow do NPD Professionals Perceive PPRs? \nOverall, 30 interviewees expressed their personal views on PPRs in the semi-structured interviews. \nThe insights gained from these interviews are presented in Table 3. This includes the frequency of \nthe different perceptions. Note that due to time constraints and the semi-structured character of the \ninterviews, not all 30 interviewees provided answers to every question. Thus, the total number of \nresponses (which is given in brackets) is always lower than 30. Furthermore, as some interviewees \nmentioned several different issues in response to one question, the sum of responses listed in Table \n3 is in some cases higher than the overall total of interviewees given in brackets. To demonstrate the \ntrail of evidence, we will discuss Table 3 in more detail.  \n \n \n \n \n  Empirical results Practical recommendations based on responses \n1 Judgements of \nPPRs \n\u2022 15 (out of 28) positive perceptions \nthat PPRs cause team reflection \nand learning \n\u2022 9(out of 28) negative comments that \nPPRs do not take place or are \nmissing top management support \n\u2022 4(out of 28) neutral comments \nthat PPR value depends on \nparticipants, culture etc. \n\u2022 Conduct PPRs for all projects \n\u2022 Communicate PPRs as the final and accepted \nproject milestone \n\u2022 Extend the circle of participants outside the core\nproject team and include all project experts \n\u2022 Support PPR importance with (partial) top \nmanagement presence and combination of PPR \nwith a social event \n8 \n2 Personal \nobjectives of \nPPRs \n\u2022 13 (of 23) focus on evaluation and \nreflection \n\u2022 9 (of 23) emphasize learning  \n\u2022 7 (of 23) suggest to find \nimprovement suggestions \n\u2022 Confirm PPRs as an important learning event \n\u2022 Enable open atmosphere and foster \nconstructive criticism and learning culture \nwithin the R&D organization \n3 PPRs and \nlearning \n\u2022 23 (of 28) view PPR discussion as a \ntrigger for generating personal \nreflection  and shared insights  \n\u2022 2 (of 28) highlight that PPRs do \nnot solve problems and are highly \ndependent from the company \nculture \n\u2022 3 (of 28) neutral comments that only \nfuture projects can show the \nlearning effect \n\u2022 Prepare, structure and manage the PPR \ndiscussion in an optimal way, e.g. with the help \nof a moderator and visual aids \n\u2022 Allow sufficient time for in-depth \nbrainstorming and reflection \n\u2022 Provide a supporting company culture that \nsupports open discussions \n\u2022 PPRs are a clear opportunity to achieve project-to-\nproject learning \n4 Outcomes of \nPPRs \n\u2022 15 (of 27) highlight documents like \nminutes or guidelines \n\u2022 10 (of 27) propose action based \nresults like checklists and open \naction points \n\u2022 8 (of 27) prefer social interactions \n\u2022 Make sure that minutes are written for all PPRs \n\u2022 Highlight the need to document action items and \nimprovement suggestions \n\u2022 Recognize tacit results from PPRs and their \nvalue to the organization \n5 Dissemi-\nnation of \nresults \n\u2022 19 (of 28) prefer social \ninteractions  \n\u2022 10 (of 28) mention documents as \ndissemination tools \n\u2022 Support exchange of tacit knowledge and \nexperience via informal networks, job rotation \nand internal presentations \n\u2022 Enable general access to minutes of PPRs and \norganized integration of PPR insights into \nguidelines and handbooks \n6 Alternatives to \nPPRs \n\u2022 15 (of 29) suggest social \ninteractions \n\u2022 9 (of 29) mention different forms of \nmeetings as alternatives \n\u2022 7 (of 29) highlight database \nalternatives \n\u2022 Ideas for other ways of sharing learning can \naugment PPRs \u2013 they do not have to be strict \nalternatives \n\u2022 Arrange regular meetings of project managers \n\u2022 Establish presentations of key experiences \nacross projects and business units \n\u2022 Support close physical proximity between \nsenior and junior staff so that \u201cstories\u201d can be \ntransferred \n\u2022 Introduce godfather programmes or coaching \nprocesses for junior project managers \n\u2022 Allocate clear responsibility for the update of \ndatabases and guidelines \n \nTable 3: Summary of Empirical Results and Recommendations \n \n1. What do NPD professionals think of PPRs? \nThe opinions on PPRs were grouped into positive, negative and neutral statements.  PPRs were \nperceived by many interviewees as an ideal occasion at which to discuss what happened during the \nproject. PPRs were perceived positively, because the presence of the development team enables \nprojects to be considered from different viewpoints and because they can help to avoid similar \nproblems in subsequent projects. PPRs were also appreciated as a source of ideas for future projects \nand giving formal closure to a project (thus avoiding that a project just \u201cfizzles out\u201d, without a clear \nend). Other interviewees stated that PPRs provide an ideal opportunity to recognize and reward the \nperformance of the team for the overall outcome of the project.  \nA perceived negative aspect of PPRs was the problem of time constraints. As NPD \norganizations generally face increasing pressure to come up with new innovative products, several \ninterviewees mentioned the high pressure to finish a project and to move quickly to the next rather \nthan spending time on a PPR.  \nNeutral statements included that the effectiveness of a PPR is very dependent on top \nmanagement support and the culture of the NPD team. If the atmosphere within the team and within \nthe NPD organization is not open to constructive criticism, then the outcome of a PPR will be \n9 \nlimited. Thus, it appears to be important that senior management clearly establish PPRs for all NPD \nprojects and for them to be at least partially present at PPRs. \n \n2. What do NPD managers want to achieve with a PPR? \nThe objectives that interviewees want to achieve from PPRs were found to fit into three categories; \nevaluation, learning, and improvement. The objective most frequently mentioned was that a PPR \nenables an objective evaluation of a project after the product has been launched. In this evaluation, \nevery aspect of a project can be considered from different viewpoints and with an immediate \nexchange of ideas. Some interviewees indicated that they want to fully evaluate projects during \nPPRs. This means not only looking at the project outcome and its quality, but also referring back to \nthe original objectives of the project and analyzing if these were met and to what degree. (These \ncomments indicate that some PPRs are perceived to focus too tightly on project outputs, rather than \nthe process.) It was perceived that project learning can result from either positive or negative \nexperiences, from mistakes or from successful practices which were applied. Often, the objective of \nNPD professionals is not only to learn but to achieve improvements by applying the lessons learnt \nto future projects. \n \n3. How do PPRs support the learning from projects? \nResponses regarding how PPRs support learning were grouped into positive and negative \nstatements. The majority - 23 interviewees - were positive about the role of PPRs in supporting \nlearning. PPRs were perceived to facilitate the exchange of experience, because the discussion \nraises different viewpoints, which individuals may not have recognized on their own. This is \nachieved in that a PPR usually brings together the whole project team, and not only the core team. \nThus, the pool of experience available is higher than in many project meetings where certain sub-\nteams discuss specific issues. Another positive aspect was that PPRs trigger personal reflections and \nlead to brainstorming within the team which does not happen during other meetings. \u201cThere are \ncertain issues that only come up at the end in the review, because only then you have the time and \npeace of mind to actually think about causes and consequences\u201d (Interviewee 2, Appliances Co.). It \nwas also mentioned that the discussion during a PPR enables more transfer of know-how within the \nteam than anything that might be formally documented and stored in databases. \u201cDuring the \ndiscussion the real important points emerge within the team - you will never find these points in \nminutes or databases\u201d (Interviewee 7, Appliances Co.).  \nOnly two interviewees expressed clearly negative perceptions regarding the role of PPRs in \nsupporting learning. One said that PPRs have limited utility in that they discuss problems and \npotential improvements but action issues are very seldom followed-up in a professional way. The \nsecond negative view was that PPRs are only effective if the company culture supports open \ndiscussion. Without this, PPRs were perceived as not being able to contribute to a learning \norganization at all. Neutral comments stressed that only the results of future projects would really \nshow whether PPRs had resulted in lessons learned within the organization. \nOverall, the majority of interviewees perceive the role of PPRs in supporting learning \npositively. Yet, it is also important to stress that learning depends to a high degree on the way the \ndiscussion is structured and moderated, the time a company invests for in-depth reflection during a \nPPR and the underlying company culture (this links to many of the points in Table 1). \n \n4. What is the ideal outcome of a PPR? \nResponses regarding the outcomes of PPRs were found to fit into three categories; documents, \naction points and social interaction. Overall, 15 interviewees thought that written summaries were \nan ideal outcome and mentioned minutes of PPRs, internal guidelines and checklists such as \noutputs. It is interesting to note that three of the 15 interviewees mentioned that only a document-\nbased approach would work in their organization. For example, at MedCare Co. there are no \n10 \npersonal relationships with colleagues in other business units and so documents are essential. A \nproject manager at Publishing Co. recommended documents as the preferable outcome of a PPR, \nbecause the company culture did not support personal and social interactions as a way to transfer \nlearning. It is interesting to note that the interviewees did not recognize the limitations of documents \n(for example, tacit knowledge cannot be disseminated by documents). This means that many \ninterviewees do not have an understanding of the different types of knowledge that can be created.  \nTen interviewees went further than mentioning documents and expressed the view that \nidentifying specific action points is important. Such action points should be allocated by a specific \nperson to be completed by a specific date. The action points can be general improvement \nsuggestions, the most important aspects to be considered in future projects or a checklist of \nremaining actions \u2013 all these are also considered to be a vital outcome of PPRs. In addition, eight \ninterviewees recognized the problems of sharing results and suggested social interactions as the \noptimal outcome of a PPR. They emphasised that the outcomes of PPRs cannot be documented in \nan efficient way and that the team discussion during the PPR is most important. \u201cI always prefer to \ndo personal presentations after the PPR took place, because only the interaction between people \ncan really transfer the knowledge gained  during the meeting\u201d (Interviewee 4, Machinery Co.).  \n \n5. How should PPR results be disseminated? \nThe responses about the dissemination of the results of PPRs were found to fit into two categories; \nsocial interaction and documents. A majority of responses (19 out of 28) stressed that results should \nideally be disseminated informally through social interactions, since this is easier and more efficient \nthan reading the minutes of PPRs. It was stressed that the best dissemination of the results of PPRs \ntakes place when the participants apply their learning to subsequent projects. Alternatively, the \nresults could also be given to a steering committee, with responsibility to disseminate the results \nwithin the wider organization. Other interviewees proposed presentations where PPR results and \n\u201cstories\u201d could be verbally presented by the project manager or team members to other members of \nthe NPD organization. Some interviewees suggested the use of documents as part of the \ndissemination of the results of PPRs and said the project team plus senior managers should receive \nthe minutes of PPRs. One of the perceived critical success factors for such a document, though, is \nthat it should not be too long, because the problem of information overload was mentioned several \ntimes. Finally, interviewees suggested to integrate the results of PPRs into official NPD guidelines \nand handbooks. Such an approach was perceived to make it more likely that the experiences would \nbe applied to future projects.  \n \n6. What are possible alternatives to PPRs? \nThe mechanism most often mentioned as a potential alternative to PPRs was social interactions, i.e. \nany kind of personal relationship within a department, project group or company which enables the \ninformal exchange of ideas and experiences. For example, interviewees said that senior employees \noften gain a reputation for their know-how in a very particular area and are consulted by colleagues \nif questions in this area arise. One factor that supports these informal networks is the co-location of \nexperienced colleagues with younger members of staff. Informal networks and personal discussion \ncan work well and it was mentioned that they provide the easiest and quickest way to find answers \nto complex questions. However, it was mentioned that one-to-one discussions are on the one hand \nhighly focused, but on the other hand they do not provide the same kind of insights as a PPR, \nbecause these combine the perspectives of the whole project team.  \nAnother mechanism mentioned was godfathers - experienced project managers assigned to \nmeet weekly with junior colleagues in order to discuss their current issues and answer questions (a \nformal way to stimulate the creation of networks). An alternative to PPRs which is based on social \ninteraction is meetings of project managers. The frequency of these meetings, however, varied a lot \n11 \nbetween the case companies. Some have the practice to meet each week, some every two or three \nmonths and some only once or twice a year.  \nInterviewees also perceived coaching meetings to be useful. In these, an experienced project \nmanager discusses example problems with a group of junior members of staff in an informal \nsession. Three out of the five case companies actively use databases to store project information and \nexperiences. However, databases are most often used to store technical data like quality issues and \nhow they were solved rather than the storage of experiences. Overall, the mechanisms mentioned \nwere perceived not as strict alternatives, but as ideas that can augment PPRs.  \nThe semi-structured interviews showed that social interactions are perceived as important \nfor the transfer of learning within NPD organizations. Table 3 includes not only the frequency of \ncomments but also gives practical recommendations based on the interviews. It can be seen that \nmany of these are related to social interactions (as indicated by bold type). However, In addition to \nstressing the importance of interaction, the organizational learning literature emphasizes tacit \nknowledge. This was investigated by looking at a range of different data from the case studies.   \n  \nIs Tacit Knowledge Created during PPRs? \nSince identification of the use of metaphors and stories has been recognized as providing evidence \nfor the creation and transfer of tacit knowledge, the data were coded accordingly. As shown by \nTable 2, the data consisted of the official minutes of 19 PPRs at the case companies, the results of \n30 repertory grid interviews, and the transcripts and notes from direct observation of 4 PPRs.  \nTable 4 shows that a total of 94 metaphors and stories were identified (four in the minutes, \n35 in the repertory grids and 55 were observed in the PPRs). For example, \u201cWe always had clear \nrules of play in our team\u201d was found in the minutes of a PPR from Appliances Co. in the summary \nof a discussion about the positive aspects of a project. In a repertory grid interview a respondent \nsaid, \u201cIn the past we had a marketing silo and a technical department silo and we have thrown our \nnot very well defined wishes over the wall to the other silo and what we got in return was not what \nwe wanted\u201d (Repertory grid interviewee 5, MedCare Co.).  \nSeveral metaphors and stories observed during PPRs were clear to the participants, but not \nto the researcher(s) present. In these cases, the discussion before or after a specific metaphor or \nstory was used was hard for the researchers to understand. For example, during the PPR at \nAppliances Co. one of the participants mentioned that: \u201cHe [the project manager] was almost like a \nsheepdog and kept circling the project team like a herd of sheep.\u201d Some minutes later in the \ndiscussion, another participant of the PPR then referred back to this statement and said \u201c\u2026yes, this \nis again the example with the herd of sheep.\u201d Although the metaphor was repeated, the researcher \nwas not clear of the meaning, although it had obviously been understood by the whole team. At that \npoint, one of the participants quietly explained to the researcher that the metaphor referred to the \nproject manager\u2019s keenness to successfully meet the project objectives and how he had monitored \nprogress very closely throughout the project.  \n \nCase \nno \nCase name Metaphors \nfound in \nminutes of \nPPRs \nNumber of \nminutes \ninspected \nMetaphors \nused during \nrepertory \ngrids \nMetaphors \nmentioned \nduring PPR \nobservations \nPPR Length \n1 Engineering Co.  5 5 14 2.5 hours \n2 Appliances Co. 2 3 12 30 7.5 hours \n3 MedCare Co.  4 5 6 2 hours \n4 Machinery Co. 1 4 3 5 3 hours \n5 Publishing Co. 1 3 10 n\/a N\/a \n Total 4 19 35 55 15 hours \nTable 4: Identification of Metaphors and Stories \n \n12 \nAnother example of the intimate nature of the discussions during PPRs was the use of a \nmetaphor observed at Appliances Co.: \u201cIt like was a game with moles. You hit one on the head and \nsomewhere else four or five other ones appear.\u201d This particular metaphor caused a lot of laughter \namongst the PPR participants but it was not clear to what it referred. Thus, the researcher asked the \nproject manager after the PPR about the background of this metaphor. He then explained that the \nmoles were metaphor for problems, i.e. as soon as a one problem was solved by the team; then \nseveral others arose straightaway. This metaphor indicates that project teams may develop their own \nvocabulary (moles = problems), which is intricately linked with the transfer of tacit knowledge. \nMetaphors and stories also appeared to enliven and bring humour to discussions about complex \ntechnological issues, by making them easier to understand for those without detailed knowledge. \nThe observation of four PPRs enabled the researchers to recognize that the atmosphere at a \nPPR appears to influence the outcome. At MedCare Co., the PPR took place in a very formal and \nserious manner and did not include a lot of interaction between the participants. In contrast, the PPR \nof Machinery Co. took place in a beer garden and was run in a very informal manner. During the \nobservation, the researcher noted that often a single metaphor or story was enough to trigger a long \ndiscussion. \nTable 4 compares different types of data and thus gives a new perspective on learning from \nPPRs in NPD. The official minutes of PPRs were found to include only 4 metaphors and stories, \nwhereas in the PPRs that were observed, metaphors and stories were used 55 times\u2014on average \nevery 16 minutes. Therefore, it appears that the social interactions in a PPR lead to the use of \nmetaphors and stories that are not then documented in the minutes. (By omitting the metaphors and \nstories from minutes, companies may be missing opportunities for disseminating knowledge). \n In the semi-structured interviews, many respondents indicated that they found interaction to \nbe very important. However, the importance of tacit knowledge was not mentioned, perhaps \nindicating that the respondents were unaware of this concept. Obviously, it would have been \ninappropriate to ask them whether they perceived tacit knowledge to be important and so repertory \ngrid technique was used to identify whether individuals\u2019 learning from NPD involved the \ngeneration of tacit knowledge. Repertory grid technique is known for probing deep into individuals\u2019 \nknowledge and so the transcripts for this part of the interviews were coded for the use of metaphors \nand stories. As shown in Table 4, the transcripts of the repertory grid interviews contain a total of \n35 metaphors and stories. This indicates that working on NPD projects develops tacit knowledge.  \nOverall, it is evident that metaphors are used by interviewees in PPR discussions (as \nobserved), but are almost entirely absent from the minutes produced. The repertory grid interviews \nindicate that individuals generate tacit knowledge from working on NPD. However, the social \ninteraction between the experts present at a PPR appears to give the most support to the creation of \ntacit knowledge.  \n \n \nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \nOverall, most NPD personnel expressed a positive personal attitude towards PPRs and their impact \non learning. This is interesting when considering that most R&D organizations do not conduct \nPPRs. Within the limitation of the exploratory current research, it was found that: \n\u0083 NPD professionals who take part in PPRs do perceive them to be a useful mechanism for \npromoting individual and team learning in NPD (based on evidence from Table 3); \n\u0083 Taking part in the discussions at PPRs is perceived to trigger insights that are of more value than \nreading what is documented in minutes, or stored databases. This can be clearly related to social \nlearning theory. A comparison of the frequency of usage of metaphors and stories in the minutes \nof PPRs and in actual meetings provides support for NPD professionals\u2019 perceptions. It appears \nthat the social interactions at PPRs do stimulate the creation and exchange of tacit knowledge \n(based on evidence from Tables 3 and 4); \n13 \n\u0083 Documents like the minutes of PPRs and checklists are an important means of disseminating \nknowledge but they do not always contain all the aspects from the discussions (based on Table 3); \n\u0083 The importance of social interactions for learning is stressed in the literature and this was \nmatched by the perceptions of NPD professionals and observations of PPR discussions, \nparticularly those held in informal settings (based on Tables 3 and 4); \n\u0083 The results indicate that metaphors and stories form an important part of PPR discussions and are \nused (consciously or subconsciously) to stimulate or summarize key points, for example related \nto technical or project management issues (based on evidence from Table 4). \n \nLimitations and Recommendations for Researchers \nAs with all exploratory research, this study has significant limitations. These are linked to the \nnecessity of having to try and identify both the key constructs and suitable measures for them. The \napproach chosen to investigate tacit knowledge may be controversial to some readers, because one \ncould argue that tacit knowledge cannot be operationalized. However, we argue that tacit \nknowledge should not only be discussed at a purely theoretical level. This paper intends to provide \na first step in that it looked for empirical data on tacit knowledge in NPD. Unfortunately, as \ncomparable data does not exist, it is not possible to judge whether the frequency of usage of \nmetaphors and stories is particularly high, or not. Furthermore, the sample of five German \ncompanies is naturally not representative. However, as an exploratory sample, it allows our \nunderstanding of PPRs to be advanced. Later research will need to look to wider samples to \nestablish externally valid results.  \nIn Table 5 we summarize our conclusions, showing the approaches we took and how we \nthink they can and should be enhanced in future research. For example, we relied on NPD \nprofessionals\u2019 perceptions of the importance of social interactions and think that additional \napproaches, such as longitudinal (ethnographic) observation will be necessary to gain a real \nunderstanding of interactions and learning. Similarly, the subjective analysis that the atmosphere of \nPPRs influences the results needs refining.  \nTacit knowledge was investigated using a proxy measure\u2014the frequency of usage of \nmetaphors and stories. A categorization of the types of metaphors and stories used by NPD teams is \nneeded, as is an understanding of what individuals perceive they have learnt from them. \nResearchers need to rise to the challenge and attempt to understand the role of social interactions \nand tacit knowledge in NPD better\u2014by moving to develop effective approaches as suggested by \nTable 5. \n \n Construct Approaches used in this study Suggested additional approaches \n1 Social interaction \u2022 NPD professionals\u2019 perceptions of \nits importance \n\u2022 Subjective assessment of the \natmosphere at PPRs by the \nresearchers \n\u2022 Longitudinal observation of \nhow NPD professionals \ninteract: frequency, depth, etc. \n\u2022 Need to measure the formality \nof PPR meetings in a more \nobjective way \n2 Tacit knowledge \ngeneration \n\u2022 Frequency of use of metaphors \nand stories in documents, \nrepertory grid interviews and in \nobserved PPRs \n\u2022 Semantic analysis of how \nmetaphors and stories are \nused \u2013 to develop an \nunderstanding of the types of \nmetaphors and stories used \n\u2022 NPD professionals\u2019 \nperceptions of what they have \nlearnt from the usage of \nspecific metaphors and stories \n\u2022 Identification of how \nmetaphors and stories are \nused outside of PPRs (e.g. to \n14 \npass learning to other project \nteams) \n\u2022 Comparison of individuals\u2019 \nperceptions of what they have \nlearnt from a project before \nand after a PPR \nTable 5: Suggested Operational Measures for the Constructs  \n \n In addition to focusing on operational measures related to learning, there is an urgent need \nfor more research on PPRs and learning in NPD. Such research needs to fully consider \norganizational learning theory. In particular, the following topics need investigation: \n\u0083 How many companies are currently using PPRs for stimulating learning in NPD? Here a \nrepresentative survey is needed; \n\u0083 A large scale survey is also needed to gather generalizable data of NPD professionals\u2019 \nperceptions of their PPR, in order to establish whether the findings from this exploratory research \nare representative; \n\u0083 What are the lessons that NPD professionals learn from working on NPD? \n\u0083 What would be suitable performance measures to determine the effectiveness of PPRs? \n\u0083 How do PPRs support project-to-project learning?   \n \nFor Practitioners \nBased on the research results, a number of recommendations can be made which are all targeted at \nthe improvement of learning in NPD: \n\u0083 The importance of PPRs needs to be supported by top management, in order to ensure that they \ntake place, have the right atmosphere, and company culture encourages constructive discussions; \n\u0083 The time and effort invested in PPRs can bring better returns if the knowledge is disseminated to \nother project teams. Managers need to actively support this process, for example by job rotation, \nthe creation of project teams with experienced as well as junior members, via informal networks, \nand through internal presentations; \n\u0083 Typical lessons learned should be disseminated to other project teams in an easily assimilated \nform e.g. by presentations, checklists, and short minutes of PPRs; \n\u0083 Tacit knowledge needs to be addressed. For example, PPRs could be combined with a \u201csocial \nevent\u201d, in order to celebrate the team\u2019s achievements. The term social event can cover anything \nfrom a visit to a museum (Appliances Co), or a dinner (Engineering Co). These events could help \nin the generation and communication of knowledge; \n\u0083 PPR discussions can be based around the use of metaphors and stories, as these appear to be \nimportant vehicles for the transfer of tacit knowledge within NPD teams. \n \nOverall, the research gives new insights into learning in new product development teams. It \ndemonstrates the potential of PPR\u2019s to generate knowledge and indicates the importance of \ninteraction between NPD professionals to transfer knowledge. Minutes and databases of lessons \nlearned have their place but as one interviewee said, \u201cYou cannot really write down experiences, \neven if you try. This is almost impossible and it would be a huge book\u201d (Interviewee 2, Publishing \nCo.). \n \nREFERENCES  \n1. Ayas, K. (1996). Design for Learning and Innovation.
