Introduction\nThe need to innovate is viewed by many companies as central to their survival strategy. Novel\nand high-tech product development is an effective way to give companies a leading edge over\ncompetitors and open new markets. Having a product of technical superiority in the market\nplace can be a significant advantage. Hence the high importance of good research and\ndevelopment for firms involved in technological products.\nResearch and Development (R&D) is an ongoing process for forward thinking technology-\nbased companies. Development of existing products is advisable to keep ahead of advances that\ncompetitors may be making. Further, when a potential customer approaches a firm outlining its\nrequirements for a product, R&D may be required to fulfil the request. More speculative \u2018blue\nsky\u2019 research is also an option for firms. Speculative R&D is a valuable avenue to open new\nmarket opportunities and this type of research may lead to totally new products being\ndeveloped, new markets being entered and thus strengthen the company\u2019s position through\ndiversification.\nWhere a firm seeks to define the balance between R&D in established areas of corporate\nknowledge and more speculative R&D a decision has to be made on how to prioritise\ninvestment. A choice exists between investing in development within proven markets and\nproduct spheres or venturing into new knowledge domains. The situation is analogous to a fleet\n3of fishing trawlers. While most of the fleet will trawl waters known to be frequented by fish, a\nfew boats may speculate by exploring uncharted waters. This can lead to new opportunities\nbeing discovered and thus reducing the fleet\u2019s dependence on its familiar areas for catches.\nSimilarly, a technology-based company may guard against being damaged by downturns in its\nestablished sectors by seeking new sectors to move into through speculative \u2018blue sky\u2019 R&D.\nLarge numbers of proposed R&D projects may potentially be pursued when considering this\nR&D philosophy. The ability to consistently select the best projects to fund is therefore vitally\nimportant to firms. Extensive academic research has been conducted over the past thirty-five\nyears or so to produce methods to improve the R&D project selection processes. Many project\nselection models have been developed over the years taking into account projects\u2019 financial\naspects, risk considerations, or ranking projects by using scoring models. Research has shown\n(Cooper et al., 2001) that the most successful approach is to select projects by considering\nfinancial, risk and project ranking, using a so-called hybrid selection model.\nDespite this scope of previous work, relatively little research has been done to investigate the\napplication of project selection processes within companies, particularly in small firms. This\nstudy looks at an individual case of applying a hybrid R&D project selection model within a\nsmall engineering company. Such a field test provides an insight into the practicalities of\napplying a model abstracted from academic research in industry. Insight is also gained into the\nR&D selection process currently used within a small UK based engineering firm. From this\nstudy the factors that determine whether or not such a project selection model is likely to be\nadopted within a particular company are analysed based on the field test results and reviewed\nliterature.\n2.  Research Project Selection Model\nWhen an organisation is tasked with deciding which research projects to proceed with, and\nwhich projects to reject, the selection process is often inconsistent. This research programme\nwas designed to test the provision of a more formal, consistent and logical management tool to\nassist in project selection. This work builds on the findings of previous research at Cranfield\nUniversity (Smout, 1995, Ferguson, 1997, Lockwood, 1999, Coldrick et al, 2002). The test\n4focuses specifically on the requirements of R&D managers in Small and Medium-sized\nEnterprises (SMEs).\nA research project selection model has been developed by Smout, 1995, Ferguson, 1997 and\nLockwood, 1999 and is used to form the basis for this work. The previous work has concluded\nthat the hybrid PSM is the type that will produce best results. This previous work has resulted\nin a theoretical and accademic model, as such work has been done in this programme to\nfacilitate the application of this model in an SME. The results reported are of a field test at a\nsmall engineering company in the aerospace instrument and telecommunications sectors and the\nconclusions are drawn on the applicability of such selection models within small companies.\n2.1 Use of Project Selection Models in Industry\nDespite the fact that many models for R&D project selection have been developed by\nacademics, very few seem to have been tested in companies. Similarly, relatively little research\nhas been published on the project selection techniques that are actually used in companies.\nThere are a limited number of surveys that have been published into methods being employed\nin large firms (Cooper et al., 1997a, 1997b). These surveys are largely based on manager\u2019s\nexperiancesand are reviewed in the remainder of this section. There is no such information\nwidely available on techniques being used in SMEs. In the absence of statistics on the\napplication of project selection models in small firms, attention is turned to surveys of methods\nused in large companies to gain insight. Therefore, this study focuses on R&D in SMEs, and\nconsequently provides novel insights currently lacking in the published literature.\nLarge firms in the USA that are proven successes in R&D activities have previously been\nsurveyed to establish the management practices they use (Matheson et al., 1994; Menke, 1997a,\n1997b). Financial methods of project selection have been found to be the most widely used\namongst large firms. However, companies that employ formalised project selection techniques\nthat incorporate risk analysis and a scoring model as well as financial analysis generally\noutperform companies that rely solely on considering the financial aspects of projects (Cooper\net al., 2001).\n5Ongoing research at McMaster University, Canada (Cooper et al., 1999, 2000, 2001), has\nsurveyed over three hundred large companies throughout the world on their R&D portfolio\nmanagement methods. From this, businesses have been sorted into four clusters based on the\nquality of their portfolio management technique and whether or not management is satisfied\nwith the current method used. These clusters were identified using cluster analysis (Cooper and\nKleinschmidt, 1995) and their definitions are illustrated below in the Table 1.\nAs expected, \u2018Benchmark\u2019 companies were found to perform best in terms of R&D project\nsuccess, with \u2018Crossroads\u2019 second best. An interesting finding is that \u2018Duds\u2019 outperform\n\u2018Cowboys\u2019 (Cooper et al., 1999). This suggests that if a company has poorly structured research\nportfolio management, it is at least better if management are dissatisfied with this state of\naffairs.\nApplying a structured and formal method of managing portfolio has been found to have several\nbenefits. The balance of projects is improved, as is the number of projects in a firm\u2019s portfolio.\nAlso, more projects are completed on time and R&D spending better reflects company strategy\nwhen good quality portfolio management techniques are used (Cooper et al., 1998).\nSurveys have shown that companies that employ formal project selection methods have better\nproject launch success than those companies with no formal project selection technique. Sales\nand profit objectives have also been found to be significantly better where structured selection\ntechniques are used (Cooper et al., 2000).\nReports on in-house R&D management techniques used within the companies SEI of Japan and\nABB show that formal documented portfolio management techniques are utilised successfully\nin these large firms (Osawa and Murakami, 2002; Stillman, 1997).\nCluster\nClassification Criteria Benchmark Crossroads Duds Cowboys\nGood portfolio management technique?

The model does not set out to establish the best portfolio mix of research projects.\nIt is designed to assess projects on their own merits, and to compare projects of similar types\nwith each other.\nProject selection models have historically fallen into three categories, financial, risk and\nscoring. The model studied here can be considered as a hybrid, composed of the three distinct\nand established project selection techniques. A scoring model is incorporated into the model, as\nis risk analysis and assessment. Financial considerations are also included in the form of Cost\nBenefit Analysis (CBA) or Discounted Cash Flow (DCF). When used as a selection tool the\nmodel is designed to be applicable to all types of research projects, but cannot be used to\ncompare projects of different types. Three project type definitions are used, namely; Basic\nResearch, Applied Research and Experimental Development. The model uses an initial\nevaluation stage to quickly establish if a project shows potential and therefore merits a more\ndetailed examination. This evaluation is qualitative and is in essence a scoring model.\nQuantitative and qualitative project criteria are set out. Scores are weighted and summed to give\na single figure result. By weighting, the significance of each criterion and category are taken\ninto account. The process by which the scores and weights are arrived at is vitally important in\napplying the model successfully. This process is discussed in detail in section 2.3.\nThe project selection stages provide a more rigorous examination by conducting risk assessment\nand analysis on those projects that give promising results in the initial evaluation stage. Cost\nBenefit Analysis or Discounted Cash Flow is also applied to analyse the financial aspects of\nproposed projects.\nA rigorous set of field tests within companies of various sizes is essential to assess the\napplicability of the model. Whereas, a study of previous work shows that the model is yet to be\ntested at first hand. It is therefore necessary to conduct further work to allow the model to be\napplied in real companies.\n72.3 Application of the Project Selection Model\nIn the previous section a need to validate the model in real firms was identified. In section 2.1\na distinct lack of documented evidence testing model usage in SMEs was highlighted.\nTherefore, this section details work done with the model to enable its application in a field test\nwithin a small engineering company in the telecommunications and aerospace sectors. A study\nof the project selection model allowed documents to be produced that enabled the model to be\napplied at the company. A step-by-step guide to model application has been developed. The\nprocess is represented diagrammatically in Figure 1. Instructions and guidelines illustrating how\nto carry out each step have also been produced.\nFigure 1 - Project Selection Model Step-By-Step Flow Chart\nSince the project selection model is applicable to all types of research projects, but cannot\ncompare projects of different types, the first step in using the model is to categorise the project\neither Basic Research or Applied Research and Experimental Development. Information on\nhow to categorise a project is shown in Figure 2. However, the nature of the field test company\u2019s\nbusiness means that they do not undertake Basic Research projects.\nGroup Project By Type\nApplied Research &\nExperimental DevelopmentBasic Research\nFilter Stage Filter Stage\nGroup By Application\nExisting ProductNew Product\nRank To Compare\nCost Benefit Analysis Discounted Cash Flow\nComparison\nSpreadsheet\nComparison\nSpreadsheet\n8Figure 2 - Project Selection Model Project Type Classification Flow Chart\nOnce a project has been classified, a simple evaluation is carried out. This \u2018Filter\u2019 stage\ndetermines if the project can quickly be rejected as obviously being unpromising. The model\nsuggests using six industry wide categories, consisting of company standard criteria. An\nexample of such a Filter stage suitable for use within the company can be seen in Table 2.\nApplication specified?\nTechnology fully understood?\nYesNo\nBasic Research\nApplied Research ExperimentalDevelopment\nNo Yes\n9Table 2 - Project Selection Model Filter Stage\nGuidance is provided on score and weighting assignments. Scores assigned in the Filter stage\nshould be established by standard group decision-making techniques. This could be by Normal\nGroup Technique (NGT), where an anonymous ballot is followed by a discussion of the scores.\nA second ballot is then averaged to establish the final score. Alternatively, Delphi technique can\nbe used; this is a remote survey with no group interaction.\nFurther consideration of the application of the model assumes that the proposed project is not\nof classification Basic Research. As previously mentioned, the company being used in the field\ntest does not undertake projects of that type.\nApplied Research or Experimental Development projects that score sufficiently well in the\nFilter stage are next put forward for more detailed consideration. Further project classification\nis required as New Product projects (generally Applied Research) cannot be compared with\nFILTER Criteria Category Project \n Score 1-5 Weight Score 1-5 Weight Score 1-5 \n1.

Once classified, projects can\nbe ranked by their scores from the Filter stage. \nFor both types of project (New Product and Existing Product) the next stage is to conduct a Risk\nAssessment. This assessment establishes the appropriate level of risk analysis with which to\nscrutinise the proposed research project. This is done by finding a value \u2018x\u2019. x is determined by\nconsidering available resources, budget and Benefit Cost Ratio. The equation for determining x\ncan be seen below.\nWhere: R is manpower resource. (1-5)\nr is the resource weighting factor.\nB is the project budget. (1-5)\nb is the budget weighting factor\na = 0.01. A weighting factor to reduce the importance of BCR\nBCR = (Benefits - Total Cost) \/ Total Cost\nAssigning values to the variables in the x equation should follow a consistent method. A single\ntable should be constructed to assess the budget and manpower resources required for the range\nof projects being considered for approval. Once values are assigned to the variables the value\nof x can be calculated, consequently the level of risk assessment corresponding to the calculated\nvalue of x is known. The process is illustrated in Figure 3.\nx R r B b a\nBCR\n-----------+\u22c5+\u22c5=\nr b+ 1=\n11\nFigure 3 - Risk Analysis Flow Chart\nProject Plan\nAnalysis\nDone\nSubmit Plan\nfor ApprovalYes\nIdentify Level\nof analysis\nNo\nx > 2\nx > 3\nx > 4\nL\/C analysis\ni) Identify\nii) Assess\nEvent Tree:\nAssess\nAnalytical\nModeling:\nAssess\nSimulation\nModeling:\nAssess\nMitigating Actions\nx > 5\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\n12\nAfter the suggested level of risk analysis is carried out mitigating action is taken in an attempt\nto reduce the chance of the project failing to meet expectations. The process then repeats from\nthe risk assessment stage until either the risk is sufficiently low to approve the project, or it is\nthe case that all mitigating action has been taken and the project is still deemed to risky to\napprove.\nFor projects that pass the risk analysis stage the next stage in the selection process depends upon\nthe project\u2019s classification. A Cost Benefit Analysis should be conducted next for projects\nclassified as New Product, while a Discounted Cash Flow study is the next stage for Existing\nProduct projects. For an existing product cash flow information can be judged, hence the more\ninformative DCF analysis is chosen over CBA. For a new product, cash flow information is\nunlikely to be able to be predicted with any degree of confidence, hence CBA techniques are\nused for financial analysis.\nFinally, in all cases is a Comparison Spreadsheet to allow selection between projects of the same\ntype to be made. This brings together for review the scoring model scores, risk analysis results\nand financial assessment findings for a final comparison of the projects being considered for\napproval.\n2.4 Project Selection Model Field Test\nIn order to gain insight into the model\u2019s potential for application within small engineering\ncompanies a project selection model field test was used with small UK-based engineering\ncompany. The firm operates in the telecommunications and instrumentation sectors and was\nchosen for its active role in R&D and product development. Work reported in previous sections\nhas readied the project selection model for application at the company. This has been achieved\nby producing documents that can be used by management at the company being considered in\nthe field test. These documents have been developed following the framework for a project\nselection model set out by Lockwood (1999).\nThe field test was facilitated by a meeting with a member of the company\u2019s senior management\nwho was is in the position of making project selection decisions. The meeting allowed the\nproject selection method developed in this research programme to be applied to a project\n13\npreviously undertaken by the company. Throughout the process of applying the project\nselection model feedback was gathered on all aspects of the model. Comparisons were drawn\nwith the method used when the company originally considered the project for selection.\nInvestigations into the selection process at the company revealed that many of their normal\nconsiderations are reflected by those in the selection model. However, at the company the\nprocess is not explicit and is carried out by an individual. As such no data is recorded.\nManagement at the company argue that the quality of decision making within the company is\nmaintained without the use of a project selection model. Good decision making employees\ncontinue to consistently make good decisions, while bad decision makers are dismissed from\nthe company.\nTherefore, the field test found that the model would not be used for decision making within the\ncompany. Indeed it has been suggested before that management are unlikely to actually use\nformal models such as this for decision making (Moore and Baker, 1969). In fact, this was found\nto be the case at the company being considered here.\nIn place of a research selection role, the possibility exists to instead use the model as an\ninformation tool. In this case application of the model aids communication of decision making\ninformation down from senior management to project leaders. Management at the company\nconsiders that the value gained by using the model for this reason is outweighed by the cost of\nits implementation. This cost was estimated to be fifteen thousand pounds per annum, as an\nadditional staff member would be needed to administer the decision making records.\nOne aspect of the project selection model is considered by the company to be potentially\nworthwhile to formalise and document. The financial analysis section of the model allows\ndocumented Discounted Cash Flow to be linked to technical and financial project targets. The\nnext section will therefore look at developing a project finances tracking framework that meets\nthe company\u2019s requirements of being quick and easy to apply.\n14\n3. Multiple Project Cash Flow Tracking\nThe research project selection model field test has shown that such a formalised and\ndocumented management tool is unlikely to be implemented within the small engineering\ncompany tested. A need has been identified to enable management to closely track the cash\nflows within the company\u2019s portfolio of projects.\nWhile the financial department will have a good understanding of company finances from the\naccounting processes, engineering management at the company currently lack this insight.\nWhat would be beneficial is a method which will allow management to conveniently track\nindividual project, as well as the overall cash flow associated with the company\u2019s entire\nportfolio of projects. The tracking method should also allow management to easily predict the\ncash flow consequences of a project running over the initially estimated time schedule and\nbudget. This should then be mapped to the portfolio cash flow to see the overall impact on\nfinances.\nTo fulfil this need a simple extension to establish Discounted Cash Flow analysis techniques is\nproposed. By presenting DCF analysis information in a particular way, projects\u2019 costs over time\ncan be efficiently tracked by management. By individually tabulating DCF information for each\nproject in the company\u2019s portfolio in a spreadsheet, the overall portfolio cash flow can be\ncalculated and displayed both numerically and graphically. Changes can easily be made to\nindividual investment figures and time scales. The impact for the project finances in the future,\nas well as the impact on the portfolio cash flow is then automatically calculated, with results\ndisplayed numerically and graphically. Table 3 shows a spreadsheet containing DCF for an\nexample  project. From a series of such project DCF tables a company\u2019s overall portfolio cash\nflow can be plotted as shown in Figure 4.\n15\nCalendar Year\nProject Year\n1990\n1\n1991\n2\n1992\n3\n1993\n4\n1994\n5\n1995\n6\n1996\n7\n1997\n8\n1998\n9\n1999\n10\nCapital Investment\nResearch Costs\nConsultancy Fees\nUniversity Fees\nLabour Resource\nFacility Investment\nInstrumentation\nRe-building\nRe-running\nTotal Investment\n0.7\n2.0\n1.5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4.2\n8.3\n2.0\n1.5\n2.0\n0\n0\n0\n13.8\n4.5\n2.0\n1.5\n2.0\n0\n0\n0\n10.0\n4.0\n2.0\n1.5\n2.0\n0\n0\n0\n9.5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n230.4\n60.0\n128.0\n418.4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n230.4\n60.0\n128.0\n418.4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n230.4\n60.0\n128.0\n418.4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n230.4\n60.0\n128.0\n418.4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n230.4\n60.0\n128.0\n418.4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n230.4\n60.0\n128.0\n418.4\nCapital Return\nPreventing Damage\nTotal Return\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\n768.0\nNet Cash Flow\nTax Effect @33%\nEffective Cash Flow\nCumulitive CF\nDisc.

Summary and Conclusions\nThe potential benefits of consistent and structured R&D project selection have long been\nrecognised in both academia and industry. For about the last thirty-five years countless models\nhave been developed to provide logic and structure to R&D project and portfolio management.\nEarly development centred on scoring and financial models. Risk assessment is also an\nestablished technique used in project evaluation. Much of the more recent work has produced\nhybrid selection tools, where the three aforementioned techniques, scoring, financial and risk\nare used to provide a more balanced project assessment tool.\nProject and Portfolio Cash Flows\n-300.00\n-200.00\n-100.00\n0.00\n100.00\n200.00\n300.00\n1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011\nYear\n\u00a3 \nx \n10\n00\nProject 1 NPV\nProject 2 NPV\nProject 3 NPV\nPortfolio NPV\n17\nA particular new hybrid project selection model has been studied. A need to field test the model\nwas identified. Consequently, work has been completed to allow translation of the model into\nan applicable form for a small engineering company. While documentation of project selection\nmodel development in academia and industry are widespread, reports of model evaluation and\nusage within industry are relatively scarce. While some studies have been conducted on model\nusage in large companies, applications within SMEs remain largely undocumented. This\nresearch has produced insights into the use of R&D project selection models in SMEs by testing\na recently developed hybrid project selection model in a UK-based engineering SME.\nThe field test conducted in this research at a typical small engineering firm points to a general\nconclusion that small companies are unlikely to adopt structured hybrid project selection\nmodels such as the model considered here. This is due to management\u2019s view that a high quality\nof decision-making is maintained without implementing a selection tool. Therefore, the benefits\nof applying a selection model are perceived to be outweighed by the cost and time involved in\nimplementing the model. However, the results are limited by the fact that this is only one\nexample. Field tests at several more small companies are desirable to gain a better\nunderstanding of the applicability of the project selection model within small firms. Different\ncompanies and different styles of management may produce different field test results. For\ninstance, the importance placed on recording the decision-making process by particular senior\nmanagers will have a significant effect on the likelihood of decision support systems being\nimplemented within a firm. Also, in larger companies, using a formal selection process to assist\ndecision-making is likely to have greater benefit than in small firms since larger firms have\nmore decision-makers and thus by default there is more to be gained by aiming to achieve a\nmore consistent decision-making process.\nThe field test has shown that cost is a barrier to small firms implementing formal project\nselection techniques. Perceived benefits of such a decision support system are judged to be\noutweighed by the cost of using a model. Many larger companies already utilise structured\nproject selection decision processes and could therefore adopt the particular model being\nconsidered here much more easily than a small firm with more limited financial resources.\nOne of the advantages of implementing the project selection model is that it allows a record of\nlearning within the company to be kept. Such records are likely to be more valuable in large\n18\ncompanies than in small firms. In large companies the scope to share decision-making\nknowledge is greater than in small firms where the number of decision-makers is less. Indeed\nin the test case here the number of decision makers is one and thus the value of keeping decision\nmaking records to share knowledge is very low. This offers an explanation as to why small firms\nin general and the company participating in this field test in particular are unwilling to invest\nthe time and money to allow the implementation of a hybrid project selection model.\nThe field test identified a need for engineering management to track R&D project and portfolio\nfinances more closely. Prompted by the willingness of management to formalise analysis and\nrecord keeping of financial aspects of R&D projects, a simple spreadsheet based tracking\nmethod has been developed. The method meets the requirements expressed by engineering\nmanagement of being quick and easy to use. It clearly displays individual project and overall\nportfolio finances over time. The method makes it straightforward for management to quickly\nestablish the effect of changes to projects\u2019 budgets and time scales to the overall portfolio cash\nflow.\nThe company\u2019s interest in only formalising financial project aspects is not altogether surprising.\nFinancial models have the most widespread use in large firms. This combined with the reduced\nvalue identified of sharing knowledge in small firms compared with large firms explains the\ngreater reluctance of small companies to adopt a hybrid project selection model.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the United Kingdom Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council and also Rotadata Ltd. for supporting this project.\n19\nReferences\nColdrick S, Lawson C P, Ivey\nP C, Lockwood C, (2002)\n\u201cA Decision Framework For R&D Project Selection\u201d,\nIEEE IEMC August 2002.\nCooper R G, Edgett S J,\nKleinschmidt E J, (1997a)\n\u201cPortfolio Management in New Product Development:\nLessons from the Leaders-I\u201d, Research Technology\nManagement, Vol. 40, Issue 5, (Sept\/Oct 1997).
