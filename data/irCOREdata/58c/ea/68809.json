Tenhunen \nNew models for estimating delay and noise in VLSl circuits, based on \nclosed farm enprersions for the fin1 and second moment of the \nimpulse responsc in coupled RC trees are reported. The effect of \ncrosstalk an delay and noise can be accurately estimated with a \ncomplexity only marginally higher than the Elmore delay. \nTiming analysis in VLSl circuits has long used the simple model of an \nRC tree where all capacitors are connected to ground, which we shall \ncall a simple tree. Signal delay through the tree is usually estimated by \napproximating the dominant time constant with the Elmore delay [I], \nthe first moment of the impulse response. For waveforms which are \npoorly represented by a single exponential, a two pole, single zero \nmodel based on the first two moments and the sum of the open circuit \ntime constants was proposed in [2]. Generic moment matching techni- \nques were later derived in [3], which could be applied for any type of \ncircuit with linear elements. Recently [4] and [5] have presented \naltematc second-order models for the transfer function, using the first \nthree moments, and the first two moments with hcuristics, respectively. \nWith the increased integration allowed by nanametre processes, noise \ncoupling has becomc very important, and the circuit model has to \ninclude coupling capacitors. In estimating the delay in such coupled \ntrees, the usual practice is to modify the Elmore delay by an empirical \ncoefficient [6] which however results in poor accuracy. General moment \nmatching can be applied, but for initial analysis that requires many \niterations, the formulation of the nodal matriccs and subsequent costly \nmatrix manipulations are best avoided, even for models which depend \non only the first three or four moments [7]. \nIn this Letter, we report second-order models for gencral arbitrarily- \ncoupled trees with multiple drivers that depend only an the first two \nmoments o f the  circuit, which moreo~er  are explicitly matched to the \ncircuit elements by means of closed form equations. Our models can be \nthought of as an extension of the methodology presented in [2], to \ncoupled trees, and represent the minimum complexity with which \nsecond-order approximations can be obtained without compromising \ngenerality. The response for each driver switching is obtained by \ngrounding all other inputs. The superposition of all waveforms allows \naccurate delay and noise cstimations. \nThe circuit topology consists of simple trees coupled to each other \nthrough series capacitors, and an example is shown in Fig. 1. The \nnotation we employ is that CSp is the capacitance to ground at node k in \nthepth tree, CC69 is the capacitance between node k on the pth tree and \nnode j on the qth tree where the firrt sub(super)scnpt refers to the \nreference tree, Rfe is the resistance shared on the piths behveen \nthe source and nodes e and k, respectively, on tree p. and 1\"; is the \nnth moment of the impulse response at the kth node. Superscripts \nalways refer to simplc trees while subscripts always refer to \nnodes, except in the definition for moments, where the supmcripl \nrefers to the order of the moment.

Hence when the victim driver \nswitches the output will always change rails, whereas it will start and \nend at the same rail far an aggressor switching. Therefore the second- \norder transfer function for the former case will have a zero on the \nnegative part of the real axis: \nand at the origin for the latter: \nUsing Kirchoffs laws and integration by parts, the first moment of \nthe impulse response at e for the victim driver switching is seen to he: \nSimilarly, the second moment is: \n1 1.2 = 2 R L  CS[rg + CC:' ib, + R;;Cq' XEvicilm 1 [ Kea) \n+CC;\"[ib, + K G 2 R a C c ]  + . . .

When applied to ( I ) ,  (3) and (4), this results in (7) \nand (8): \n(7) \n(8) \nr;. = r ,  + T> - r:.\" \n(7:,)' = ( 7 ,  + il - Tz.r)(rl + d - z l i i  \nNow T, and r2 in (7) and (8) refer to the dominant poles for the event of \nthe victim driver switching. To solve this system of three unknowns, a \nthird equation is required. Since all aggressors are grounded thc \nmetric that gives the best solution is the sum of the open circuit lime \nconstants with reference IO the victim driver, which we shall call ~ p ' .  \nThis is a good approximation for the sum of the pole time constants, \ngiving: \n1; = i, + z2 (9 )  \nNow (7), (8) and (9) can be solved for the zero and two poles associated \nwith the victim switching. \nTo salve for the poles and zeros associated with an aggmsor \nswitching, the above identity is used on (2) ( 5 )  and (6 )  to give: \n7;. = ko, (10) \n(75,)' = T ~ , ~ , ( T ,  + T I )  (11) \nNow the zero is available immediately, and dividing (1 I )  by (IO) results \nin the pole sum: \nAgain, the ~olution for the poles requires extra information, which can \nbe obtained by using intuition gained from the physical interpretation of \nthe moments. The first moment includes resistances of the switching \nline, and either all capacitances connected to i t  (when the victim \nswitches) or capacitances connecting it to a particular line, (when an \naggrcsrar switches). The second moment propagates outwards another \nlevel, and includes resistances and capacitances o f  immediately adja- \ncent lines as well. Since the victim is the net of interest, combining: the \nmoments for the victim switching with those for a particular aggrmor  \nswitching resulti in a solution which is  biased towards the victim and \nthat aggressor. Hence to obtain the solution to a switching aggressor, \n(7), (8) and (12) can be combined to generate the two poles of interest. \nI 0.047 \n0.12 \nerror at25%=1% \nerror at peak=-2% \nerror at 25%=-1% \npeak noise err01=151 peak noise eiror=5% \n0.04 \n0.04 p: \nerror at 25%=4% \nerror at peak=-1% \n0 . 0 3 h  error at 25%=-1% \nerror at25%=1% \npeak noise error=3% 0.02 Deak noise error=15% \no.ot] \\ \n0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5  \nns ns \nc d \nerror at 50%=0% \nerror at DO%=O% \n0.4 \n.2L 0 0 1 2 3 4 5  \nns \ne \nFig. 2 Response ai oulput node e\/or .nviiching of drfferrrnr drivers \n0 Response of aggressor tree 4 \nb Response of aggressor wcce 3 \nc Response of aggressor tiee 6 \nd Response of aggressor tree 5 \nr Response of viclim \nThe accuracy of the models for the transfer function were tested by \ncomparing the step rcsponses for a variety of circuits against a dynamic \nsimulator Spcctre, and found to be excellent for the vast majority The \nwaveforms shown in Fig. 2 correspond to the circuit of Fig. 1.

One remedy would be to use the third moment of the impulse \nresponse to gather extra information, and use a technique that guaran- \ntees stability, similar to that descibed in [4], just for those comer cases. \nAnother would be to consider simple circuit transformations, as any \ninstability is an indication that the response is dictated by a very limited \nsection of the overall circuit for that particular case.
