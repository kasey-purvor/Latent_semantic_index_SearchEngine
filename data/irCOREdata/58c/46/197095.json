Process Theory Between Scylla and Charybdis \n \n \nIn this paper, I propose a middle way between current process and substance theorising as I \nargue that both \u201cpure\u201d views are fraught with theoretical problems. I base my proposal on the \nontologies of Aristotle and A.N. Whitehead, who both maintain that being and becoming are \nequally important for a comprehensive analysis of change processes. Drawing on their \ninsights, I develop a conceptual frame that distinguishes between change and becoming, and \nproposes to use the pairs of potentiality-actuality and activity-relationality as notions that are \nless fraught with conceptual baggage and more relevant empirically than the distinction \nbetween substance and process. \n \n \n \n \nWord count: 10497 \n 2 \nAs we all know, the ancient Greeks had a really good time. They were unbothered by \ndisciplinary power, iron cages (except the obvious sort), or high reflexivity. To compensate \nfor that, their cruises were sometimes cut short \u2013 often terminally so - by two horrible \nmonsters called Scylla and Charybdis. This bad luck also befell Odysseus on his extended \ncruise: \n \n\u201cScylla was a supernatural creature, with twelve feet and six heads on long, snaky necks, \neach head having a triple row of sharklike teeth, while her loins were girt with the heads of \nbaying dogs. From her lair in a cave she devoured whatever ventured within reach, \nincluding six of Odysseus\u2019 companions. [\u2026] Charybdis, who lurked under a fig tree a \nbowshot away on the opposite shore, drank down and belched forth the waters thrice a day \nand was fatal to shipping. [\u2026] The shipwrecked Odysseus barely escaped her clutches by \nclinging to a tree\u2026\u201d (\u201cScylla and Charybdis\u201d 1993) \n \nMore prosaically inclined fellows say that Scylla was a rock and Charybdis a maelstrom in the \nWestern Mediterranean Sea. Whatever the case, let us remember that Odysseus clings to a \ntree\u2026 \n \nThe Odyssey: Analysing Organizational Change \n \nIt is probably fair to say that, in terms of quantity, the literature on organizational change has \nexploded since the 1980s. For these last three decades, change has been the most pervasive \nsubject in organization studies, sociology, and social theory. However, this interest is not \nrestricted to academia as most of the major public discourses (e.g. globalisation, breakdown \nof post-war order, cloning and genetics) relate to change as well. This conceptual move is so \noverpowering that terms like \u201cstatic\u201d, \u201cstable\u201d, \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201ceternal\u201d have even gained a \n 3 \npejorative status. For a company to be pronounced static in this world of hyper-competition \nseems to constitute a near death sentence. Employees deemed resistant to change and learning \nare treated as either dumb or obstinate and in sore need of re-education. Academics are \nexpected to publish new insights quickly and copiously \u2013 and the best way to do this is by \nresearching into change because change, by definition, is new every day. Thus, a search for \nthe subject of \u201corganizational change\u201d in the EBSCO Business Source Complete database \nrenders over 16,000 articles, while its counterpart \u201corganizational stability\u201d is not even listed.  \nIn contrast to this rather overwhelming verdict on the importance of change versus stability, \nthe present paper seeks to rehabilitate stability as a realist, ontologically founded concept of \nequal importance as change. It does so by connecting to current discussions on change and \nprocess which have been given a new twist by the emergence of approaches based on process \nphilosophies within the last decade (see, for example, the special issues of \u201cOrganization\u201d \n1\/2002 and \u201cOrganization Studies\u201d 6\/2002, the 1st Organization Studies Summer Workshop \nin 2005 and the annual International Symposia on Process Organization Studies since 2009).  \n \nThe field of organizational change has indeed become so vast that meta-analyses are needed \nto structure it. The meta-analyses on change published in the last decade (van de Ven and \nPoole, 1995; van de Ven and Poole, 2005; Weick and Quinn, 1999) all point to a similar \ndistinction. This distinction - although I do not approve of it for reasons given later in the \npaper \u2013 thematises the opposition of stability versus change, or substance versus process. \nThus, Weick and Quinn (1999) talk about episodic versus continuous change, van de Ven and \nPoole (1995) distinguish between a prescribed and a constructive mode of change, and ten \nyears later van de Ven and Poole (2005) posit organizations as social entities against the view \nthat organizations are composed solely of organizing processes. In these typologies, the \nrespective first term portrays a form of change that is, one way or the other, embedded in \nstability: stable conditions, stable patterns, stable environments and\/or stable substances. The \n 4 \nrespective second term, on the other hand, gives priority to change itself and either negates \nstability or relegates it to the observer\u2019s mind. The distinction is taken up by process \ntheorists1 2006, for instance Bakken and Hernes ( ), Chia and Tsoukas (2002) and Chia (1999). \n \nIn the paper at hand, I shall take a closer look at the two major camps and indicate some of \ntheir shortcomings. As so often with \u201cversus\u201d-classifications, the differentiation between the \ntwo camps is, first, far less clear cut than I give credit for below. I believe, however, that the \ncritique presented applies to the authors quoted and to a number of authors arguing in the \nsame vein. Second, the classification is proposed and upheld by one side only, viz. the process \ntheorists. Apart from substantial concerns, one reason for this is certainly political, an attempt \nto legitimise a new field of study by attacking the reigning paradigm. Substance theorists, on \nthe other hand, seem to be interested neither in the distinction nor in a critique of process \ntheory as such. For that reason, most points of critique of the substance view are taken from \nprocess theorists, whereas most points of critique of the process view are mine. Although I \nconsider myself a process theorist, I think organizational process theory in its present state \nwould benefit from the more subtle conceptual distinctions I shall propose in the middle \nsections of this paper. Specifically, I should like to stop the field revolving around the \nsubstance\/process or being\/becoming distinction and move on to more fruitful conceptual \ntools. At the end of the paper, I will revisit the literature introduced at the beginning and \ncompare it to my model of organizational change and process. \n \nThe Scylla of Substance: A Process Critique \n \nBarnett and Carroll follow the classical substance view by defining: \u201cOrganizational change \ninvolves, by definition, a transformation of an organization between two points in time.\u201d \n(Barnett and Carroll, 1995:219). To them, an organization \u201cchanges when and how its \n 5 \nmanagers decide it will\u201d (Barnett and Carroll, 1995:220), allowing for unexpected outcomes \nand, in some cases for change as an unintentional by-product of other decisions and actions. \nIn line with their theoretical background, they consider change, especially \u201ccore\u201d changes of \nan organization\u2019s mission, authority structure, technology, or marketing strategy, very risky \nand prone to result in the death of the organization, which is the central event to be captured \nempirically. On a more abstract level, the underlying model is relatively simple: the \norganization is a stable or inert, quite unproblematic \u201cthing\u201d that suddenly \u201cjumps\u201d (i.e. enters \na change process), and may eventually be fatally damaged on landing2. The moments t1 and t2 \n(before and after the jump) are empirically relevant, and change is the difference between the \ntwo. However, the little analogy of the jump immediately shows the problem of the \nassumption: the essentials of a jump, i.e. a movement, cannot be captured by describing a \nperson standing still in a place before and after. What can be measured is the length of the \njump, but \u201cthree meters\u201d is not a description of the unfolding of a jump, however useful the \nfigure may be in certain contexts. This is largely why change, process theorists (for example, \nChia, 1999; Chia and King, 1998) would argue, cannot be reduced to two static states linked \nby a formal operation, indeed, it loses its essential qualities in the process. Time series \nmeasurement in general does acknowledge this fact when it prefers short intervals between t1, \nt2,\u2026 (and thus more points in a given time span) over long intervals (and fewer points in a \ngiven time span), considering the former to be more precise. What actually happens is that the \ninterval between t1 and t2, which is change, is more and more reduced, ideally approximating \nzero. Hence, the basic aim of the model is to reduce and ignore change rather than describe or \nexplain it. A process view, on the other hand, brings the process \u201cin between\u201d the two states \nto the focus of attention to the extent that the two states appear only as outcomes or \ntemporarily stabilized instances of it. \n \n 6 \nIn my second example, Greenwood and Hinings also define organizations as substances in my \nsense portraying them as \u201cheterogeneous entities composed of functionally differentiated \ngroups\u201d (Greenwood and Hinings, 1996:1024) that are embedded in an institutional context. \nThese organizations normally reproduce themselves and their beliefs (convergent change), but \nsometimes also enter phases of radical change. The incidence and pace of radical changes \nvaries across and within institutional sectors. The institutional context is crucial for these \ndevelopments because ultimately \u201c[t]o survive, organizations must accommodate institutional \nexpectations\u2026\u201d (Greenwood and Hinings, 1996:1025). Change, again, is the exception to the \nrule, the enigma or explanandum leading to the basic question \u201c\u2026how does institutional \nchange occur?\u201d (Greenwood and Hinings, 1996:1028, quoting DiMaggio and Powell). This \nview also meets with some problems, perhaps most evident in the choice of language. \nSandelands and Drazin (1989) have directed attention to the use of \u201cachievement words\u201d like \n\u201csurvive\u201d and \u201cadopt\u201d, which suggest agency where none can be found. The problem, to \nthem, is that we take abstractions, for example organizations, to be real things or actors and \nemploy our semantics accordingly. Analysing the language of exogenetic or evolutionary \nperspectives of organizational change, they conclude:  \n \n\u201c\u2026the word organization is used in two ways; as a name for the fact that people or actions \nare related in a pattern, and as a name for a thing that is acted upon by the environment or \nby strategic decision-makers. This second use is a hypostasization; it involves treating an \nentity that cannot be denoted as though it could be denoted. This problem stems from the \nfact that language reifies; the act of naming produces entities that are easily mistaken as \nmaterial and do-to-able things.\u201d (Sandelands and Drazin, 1989:464) \n \nThe two examples from the literature may serve as illustrations of the problems the substance \nview has with the notion of change; problems that have been noted by a number of \n 7 \nphilosophers over the centuries, for example Locke, Leibniz and Hegel (for a brief overview, \nsee Rescher, 1996). The problems are caused by the very definition of the term. Since \nantiquity, substances are defined as self-sufficient (i.e. not derived from or reducible to \nanything else) and as capable to affect other things (i.e. as agents). This goes back to the  \nseminal definition by Aristotle, which is still used today (for example, Robinson, 2009):  \n \n\u201cSubstance, in the truest and primary and most definite sense of the word, is that which is \nneither predicable of a subject nor present in a subject [\u2026] Thus everything except primary \nsubstances is either predicated of primary substances, or is present in them, and if these last \ndid not exist, it would be impossible for anything else to exist.\u201d (1993a:6). \n \nWhat Aristotle says here is that a substance is an individual \u201cthing\u201d like the ones we find as \ngrammatical subjects in particular (i.e. non-general) statements. Thus, \u201cSocrates\u201d is a \nsubstance. What is predicable of a substance, for example attributes (\u201cbrown\u201d), relations \n(\u201cbigger than\u201d) or kinds (\u201cman\u201d), are not substances in the primary sense. (For a more \ndetailed and subtle discussion of the various implications, see Robinson, 2009). The next idea \nis that substance is primary to what can be predicated of it and functions as a \u201ccarrier\u201d of its \npredicates. Thus, we can \u201cload\u201d Socrates with many attributes: old, funny, wise, tall, etc., \nwhile the attributes, vice versa, could not in the same sense be \u201cloaded\u201d with: Socrates, \nPhilippos, Menelaos etc. Hence, predicates need substances as carriers exist, while substances \nneed nothing else to exist. Young Socrates existed, young as such does not exist in the same \nway. The Aristotelian definition then was taken up by medieval scholasticism (de Vries, \n1983), for example in Thomas Aquinas\u2019 {, 1993 #2462:17} rendition \u201cA substance is a being \nthat subsists of itself\u201d,  and has informed the debate ever since (for a history of the concept \nsee Halfwassen et al., 1998). If substances are ontologically prior to everything else, they \n 8 \ncannot be caused by something because a cause precedes its effect. They are, hence, self-\nsufficient. If they cannot be effects, they can only be causes. Thus, they are natural agents. \nHence attributing an organization the status of a substance almost unfailingly invites \nachievement words and hypostasization because it implies that the organization is an agent. \nFurthermore, because of the self-sufficiency, causality is a major problem for any substance \nview. Once entities are established as self-sufficient, it is difficult to explain how and by what \nthey should be affected at all. Process theorists would criticise that any (temporal or causal) \nlink to another substance has been severed the very moment an entity has been declared a \nsubstance. It now stands for itself, by itself, and has to be (causally) re-linked, which takes a \nmajor theoretical effort. Substance theories also tend to be prone to what Bhaskar (Bhaskar, \n1991; Norrie, 2010) calls \u201contological monovalence\u201d. This refers to the ontological position \nthat negativity or absence is denied recognition as a category of being because being is solely \ndefined in positive terms.  \n \nThe Charybdis of Process: A Critique of Process \n \nHaving established why it is clever of the average sailor to steer clear of big, stable, cutting-\nedge rocks, let us now take a closer look at the second monster. In the subsequent sections, I \nwill concentrate on three aspects of process theory as presented in organization theory that I \ndeem problematic. \n \nThe swirl of language \n \nReviewing the organizational literature on process, especially the authors propagating a \n\u201cstrong view\u201d (Chia, 1996; Chia, 1999; Chia and King, 1998; Clegg et al., 2005; Cooper, \n2007; Drazin and Sandelands, 1992; Linstead and Thanem, 2007; Nayak, 2008; Shotter, 2006; \n 9 \nTsoukas and Chia, 2002; Wood, 2002; Weick, 1969), the first problem continuously remarked \nupon is one of language and concepts. Chia and King (1998) state that \u201cWe are not good in \nthinking movement.\u201d Weick (1969) suggests talking in verbs rather than nouns to capture the \nnature of organizational reality. Tsoukas and Chia (2002:569) ask how \u201cchange [can] be \nthought of in its own terms\u201d. Their common concern is that academic and everyday language, \ndue to the persistent influence of the substance view, relies on apparently stable concepts like \nthings, persons, and organizations, and is thus ill-adapted to express a process view. There is, \nhowever, disagreement on whether the disease can be cured. Nayak (2008:178) talks about the \n\u201cnon-representational, hidden and latent nature of reality\u201d that is, in a quote of Bergson \n\u201cconsequently inexpressible\u201d (Nayak, 2008:179). This implies that language, to the extent that \nit operates with fixed and stable concepts, cannot capture fluid reality, marking the most \nradical, and ultimately pessimistic view on process. A more conciliatory approach starts from \nthe same assumption, but adds that new methods can be devised, a new language invented in \norder to express processual reality. This is prominently Bergson\u2019s approach, echoed by Chia \nor Nayak. It entails the method of \u201cintuition\u201d. Intuition, very briefly, is a kind of introspection \nfocussing on inner \u201cflows\u201d and the inner experience of dur\u00e9e. This focus is then used to \u201cget \ninto\u201d other phenomena and understand\/empathise their flow and dur\u00e9e (for a detailed \ndescription see Nayak, 2008).   \n \nI believe both approaches have their problems. The first makes process unavailable, similar to \nKant\u2019s Ding-an-sich (which, for all we know, may even be processual!). We cannot know it, \nwe cannot speak about it, and perhaps we should heed Wittgenstein\u2019s advice at the end of his \nTractatus: \u201cWhereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\u201c As a theory, it is not \nrefutable, but as it is incommunicable, it is quite useless for scientific analysis. The second \napproach is more viable as it suggests the possibility of accessing process after adjusting \none\u2019s way of perception. The problem of communication, however, remains. This time, it is \n 10 \nnot a general incommunicability of the phenomenon, but the inherent solipsism of the method. \nIntuition and introspection as experiences are incommunicable as they are always my \nintuition, which differs from your intuition. I may translate my experience into language after \nI have had it but translating it I already change it - and probably lose the important bits. This \nproblem is not limited to intuition, but can be found in most methods that try to get \u201cin sync\u201d \nwith reality in a pre-conceptual manner from Mediaeval mysticism to Husserl\u2019s epoch\u00e9. \nWhile the experience in itself can surely be made, it cannot as such be communicated. \nCommunication, however, is the coin of knowledge and of science.  \n \nOn a more general plane, however, I should like to question the basic assumption that a \nchange in our ontological perspective necessitates a change in language at all. The proposition \nbecomes attractive if one, like Bergson (1993; 1911), dichotomises between matter on the one \nand lived experience on the other hand, and accordingly between traditional analysis on the \none and intuition on the other hand. It is tempting to reason that as we have progressed too far \ntowards the one pole of the continuum, we must now reverse, discard our tools and find new \nones. This thinking in opposites, however, is not a necessary ingredient of process philosophy, \nas Whitehead (1985) shows. To him, language is always elliptical, never capable of rendering \nthe whole of experience, always cutting out, abstracting something. He admits that traditional \nphilosophy has led us to believe that, for instance, the subject-predicate pattern of our \nlanguage represents an ontological fact about particular substances \u201cdoing\u201d things. He \nmaintains, however, that we are perfectly capable of \u201crethinking\u201d this proposition and \nsevering this relationship. Whitehead is a \u201cnatural realist\u201d (Hoffmann et al., 1992) in that he \nholds, against Kant, that we can and do experience process immediately, and against critical \nrealists3 that we can do so without transcendental reflexion. His tenet is founded on the \npresupposition that human beings are in no way different from the entities that surround them. \nThere is, in consequence, no ontological categorical difference between culture (noumena) \n 11 \nand nature (phenomena) or experiencing subject and experienced object. Every being \nexperiences and is experienced by others. This experiencing is the integral part of an entity\u2019s \nbecoming, crudely speaking, it is because it experiences. In such a scheme there is no place \nfor transcendence as entities are always deeply embedded and immediately affected by what \nis going on around them4. Human perception can reflect and distance itself at later, more \nadvanced stages of perception, then involving symbols and language, but its original input is \nthe world as unmediated process. Thus, language is not in our way when we perceive process \nand communicate our perceptions. It is our interpretations of language that may get in the \nway, but interpretations can be changed.  \n \nThe swirl of potentiality  \n \nEvery new theory comes with a promise. In the case of organizational process theory, \nTsoukas and Chia (Tsoukas & Chia, 2002:568) name even three: a more complete \nunderstanding of the micro-processes of change, learning how change is actually \naccomplished, and producing more successful change programmes. Of the three, I believe the \nsecond promise to be inherently problematic. Tsoukas and Chia (quoting James) criticise \ntraditional explanations of change as  \u201cpostmortem dissection\u201d that only explain ex post facto \nwhy an organization has changed the way it did. They complain that \u201c\u2026we do not know \nenough about how change is actually accomplished. [\u2026] If organizational change is viewed \nas a fait accompli, its dynamic, unfolding, emergent qualities (in short: its potential) are \ndevalued, even lost from view.\u201d (Tsoukas & Chia, 2002:568). While I agree that change can \nand should be attended to on the micro level, I do not think process theory can make good on \nthe promise of potentiality. To be more precise, although process theory can raise the issue \nand sensitise readers to the existence of potentials, it is no better equipped to analyse them ex \n 12 \nante than substance views. This is because this is not a matter of methods or methodology, but \nof logic. Let me explain this. \n \nWhat is potential is, by definition, not actual. The difference between the two states lies in \ntheir determinacy, i.e. we can say about something actual that it is x or that it is not y. We \ncannot make a similar statement about something potential because it \u201cis\u201d not in the same way \nas something actual is. We cannot observe potentials, only surmise from prior experience, for \nexample, that a piece of wood is a potential chair or a drunken driver a potential danger. Even \nthe most elaborate technical simulations are based on functions and parameters that are \nderived from prior tests and observations. In consequence, their predictions are bound to be \nprobabilistic. An engineer may predict that a particular aircraft will explode, but that is still a \nprobabilistic statement, and any statistician will confirm that even a probability of 1 does not \nmean that the event is certain to happen. Or, to take an example from logic, the statement \u201cIt \nwill rain tomorrow.\u201d is neither verifiable nor falsifiable. All we can do is wait until tomorrow \nand then verify or falsify the statement \u201cIt rains today.\u201d These examples show that potentiality \ncannot be empirically described or analysed in the same way as actuality can be. We can, of \ncourse, take the pragmatic view and say that a probability of 1 is good enough for our \npurposes, which means acting as if the prediction was a statement about an actual occurrence. \nIn most real-life cases, that is what we do. In categorical terms, however, there is no way to \nbridge the gap between potentiality and actuality. \n \nBack to Tsoukas and Chia, that means process theory is no better off than substance theory. \nNo matter from which ontology you argue, the categorical difference between potentiality and \nactuality remains the same. No matter which (process) methods one adopts, one will not \nbridge the gap because it is not a matter of method but of category. We cannot grasp \npotentials empirically except as probabilistic predictions or after they have been realised (ex \n 13 \npost facto). And indeed process theory, in another context, states this need for ex post analysis \nwhen it talks about \u201cheterogeneous becoming\u201d (Chia, 1999:218), \u201cdifference in kind\u201d (Nayak, \n2008:179), or \u201cconcrescence\u201d (Whitehead, 1985): All these processes have a unique and \nnovel ingredient that is, by definition, unforeseeable. It is not only new in the sense that it is in \nthe future, but in the sense that it is different from what came before. As such, it cannot be \npredicted or inferred but only observed after it has been realised (ex post facto). It is, \nconsequently, only with regard to the conceptualisation of potentials, not the prediction, that a \nprocess view has an advantage over a substance view. Substance views have difficulties \nintegrating potentiality because their primary entities (i.e. primary substances) are perfectly \nactualised entities that carry no potentials. Process, in contrast, always implies a movement \ntowards something that is not yet actualised. \n \nIn any case, as I have stated at the beginning of this section, potentiality is an important \nfeature, and process theory is right to sensitise readers to its significance. I will come back to \na discussion of potentiality and actuality later on. \n \nThe swirl of history \n \nProcess theory draws much of its charm from the \u2013 correct - analysis of the errors of the \nsubstance view. Bergson (1911), for example, devotes far more space to the critique of the \nexisting paradigm than to the discussion of his own view. In the same vein, most organization \nscholars derive the justification of their process view from the refutation of the substance \nview. While I have no objection to the procedure in general \u2013 after all, regicide is considered \ngood practice in science \u2013 I am somewhat uneasy about this special application.  \nRegicide only works if there is (exactly) one king. If there are more contenders, you would \nhave to kill them all in order to gain the throne, which is far more messy and cumbersome. \n 14 \nThe same is true for substance and process views. Establishing the process view through a \ncritique of the substance view only works if there are no other contenders. Organizational \nprocess scholars sometimes create this illusion by going back to Parmenides and Heraclitus as \nthe two most prominent proponents of the respective views. They then portray the whole \nhistory of Western philosophy as \u201clittle more than a continuing series of footnote attempts at \nsynthesizing these two great but apparently irreconcilable intellectual traditions.\u201d (Chia, \n1999:214) This view, I think, is misleading. Even in antiquity, Heraclitus and Parmenides \nwere considered to be extreme in their views, and almost all authors, most notably and \ninfluentially Aristotle, posited themselves somewhere in the middle between the two. As I \ncannot enter into a full-blown philosophical discussion here, let me cut the argument short \nwith an far more cautious assessment of the process philosopher Rescher: \n \n\u201cThough its antecedents reach back deep into classical antiquity, [the doctrine of process \nphilosophy] as such is a creation of the twentieth century\u2026\u201d (Rescher, 1996:1) \n \nAnd on the historical background: \n \n\u201cHeraclitus may accordingly be seen as the founding father of process philosophy [\u2026]. \nAnd the static system of Parmenides affords its sharpest contrast amid the most radical \nopposition.\u201d (Rescher, 1996:9, my italics) \n \nThere is more \u2013 a lot more - to the history of Western philosophy than just \u201cnothing but \nbeing\u201d and \u201cnothing but becoming\u201d.  \n \n 15 \nTo summarise, what I take from this critique to my own model is the conviction that no new \nor special language is needed to theorise process; that potentiality and actuality are important \nconcepts, but in logical and ontological terms and not with regard to their empirical-predictive \ncapacity; and that there are not just two ways of solving the substance-process problem. In the \nsubsequent section, I shall discuss some authors trying to conceptualise a third (fourth and \nfifth) way. I will begin by introducing some conceptual distinctions that are important for my \n\u201cbeing-becoming\u201d model. \n \n \nA Very Greek Concern: Conceptual Distinctions and Ontological Oppositions \n \nThe original philosophical problem concerning becoming is easy to state but difficult to \nsolve5. When we say \u201cSomething becomes.\u201d we imply that there already is something that \nthen becomes. However, if something already is, there is no need for it to become. On the \nother hand, if we suppose that there is nothing in the beginning, it is difficult to explain how \nthe process of becoming should start at all. This is captured in the old formula of \u201cex nihilo \nnihil\u201d (nothing springs from nothing), but as much present, for example, in the first law of \nthermodynamics, which states that the energy of a closed system is conserved and cannot be \nincreased without input. In this section, I want to turn to solutions proposed by Aristotle, \nThomas Aquinas, and A.N. Whitehead, who have tackled the problem in similar ways6. \n \nAristotle (Brentano, 1975; Buchanan, 1962; Sachs, 2001; Aristotle, 1993c; Aristotle, 1993b) \ndistinguishes between two meanings of the term \u201cbecoming\u201d, which coincide with two \ndifferent grammatical forms. One takes \u201cbecoming\u201d to be an intransitive verb (\u201cSomething \nbecomes.\u201d), the other takes it to be transitive (\u201cSomething becomes something else.\u201d). In the \nfirst case, something new is established, while in the second something already existing \n 16 \nchanges into something else. Aristotle reserves the term \u201cbecoming\u201d in a narrow sense \n(genesis) for the first case, and refers to the second as \u201cchange\u201d (kin\u00easis7). According to this \ndefinition, change presupposes a particular (i.e. a being), which then changes in some way. \nBecoming, on the other hand, is created from nothing, or more precisely, from non-being. \nAristotle\u2019s idea here is that in the process of becoming a potential is realized. A potential, \nhowever, is by definition not actual because it lacks a number of attributes that define being \n(quality, quantity, time, location, number etc.). In this sense, it can be characterised as non-\nbeing. Hence, becoming characterises a transition from non-being to being, or from \npotentiality to actuality. This also marks the source of our problems to describe a process of \nbecoming as we cannot apply the attributes of being to it. Change, on the other hand, does not \nface these difficulties as it takes place in the realm of being, with \u201cbeings\u201d being changed into \nother \u201cbeings\u201d.  \n \nMoreover, change is in physical time in a way becoming is not. This is a very challenging \ndistinction as it requires the conception of a process, i.e. a succession of before-after, that is \nnot temporal. The idea is introduced, with many examples but still conceptually vague, by \nAristotle in his \u201cMetaphysics\u201d (Book VII). He describes a number of processes in which an \norganism or a gestalt comes into being, for example a sculptor chipping off marble from a \nblock to make a statue. The temporal problem with these processes is that although we can \ndetermine a moment in physical time where we add (or chip off) a part, we can not determine \nthe moment in time when the gestalt or the whole-that-is-more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts \nappears. A modern echo of this may be the discussion at which point in time a lump of cells in \na woman\u2019s womb becomes a human being (with the right to live). Whitehead (1985:68f and \n283) takes Aristotle up on this8 and uses the notion of \u201cquantum\u201d to refer to the fact that \nbecoming is an extended process (i.e. has before and after), but cannot be divided like a \ntemporal process. That is because \u201cEach phase in the genetic process presupposes the entire \n 17 \nquantum\u201d (Whitehead, 1985:283). This state of affairs is different from change in physical \ntime, where we can divide and add at any point in time. If we look at, for example, a marathon \nrunner, we can attribute a moment in physical time to each of the steps without having to take \nthe whole of the run into account. \n \nThomas Aquinas (see P\u00f6ltner, 2001) makes a similar distinction (for a comparison see Table \n1) between becoming as a process of production (mutatio) and becoming as an event \n(creatio).  An example for the first process is a builder building a house. We can distinguish a \nphase of production in which the house becomes from a phase of being in which the finished \nhouse sits on the ground. In this case, being is the result of becoming, while becoming is a \nprocess of change from one being (bricks) to another (house). In Thomas\u2019s words, the cause \nof the becoming or building of the house (causa fiendi) is different from the cause of its \ncontinued being (causa essendi) as the builder is responsible for the former, but not for the \nlatter. The second process, which Thomas refers to as creatio, on the contrary, finds being and \nbecoming happening at the same time. An example for this would be an act of communication \nor any other event, which is (only) as long as it becomes. The reason is that its causa fiendi \nand causa essendi are identical. Moreover, as with Aristotle, we find the idea of indivisibility \nin this second process of becoming for people do not participate in a talk by claiming an \nindividual part of it. Although a conversation normally takes turns, the process of \ncommunication itself cannot be divided. \n \nIn Whitehead\u2019s ontology, as already indicated, the distinction can be rendered as change in \ntime versus timeless becoming. To him, change can only happen if there is a minimum of \ncontinuity to posit it against because change involves a comparison in time. We say, for \nexample, that John has changed when we compare what we see of him today with our \nmemory of him some time ago. For this reason, actual occasions (the ultimate building blocks \n 18 \nof Whitehead\u2019s cosmos) cannot change because they perish the moment they come into being. \nThe only entities that can suffer change are enduring objects, which consist of \u201cstrings\u201d or \n\u201cwebs\u201d of actual occasions linked together in a certain way over time (for example, the \nidentity of a person being made up of all her actions or decisions over time). As each of its \nactual occasions differs from all the others, but at the same time the whole complex retains \nsome identifiable \u201cgestalt\u201d, we can perceive the enduring object as changing. Timeless \nbecoming (concrescence), on the other hand, describes the becoming of the actual occasions \nthemselves. This process is a transition from indeterminateness to perfect determination, or in \nother words, from potentiality to actuality. As I have argued before, such a transition is not in \ntime.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nTo sum up, it makes sense to distinguish between change on the one and becoming on the \nother hand. Change \u2013 Aristotle\u2019s kin\u00easis, Thomas\u2019s mutatio, Whitehead\u2019s change - would \nrefer to an already existing entity that undergoes some modification but continues to be \nrecognised as the same entity. Becoming (genesis, creatio, concrescence), on the other hand, \nwould refer to the emergence of new entities. It is an event that perishes as soon as the process \nof becoming is finished and the activity maintaining the event ceases. It is important to note \nthat in what follows I will use \u201cbecoming (genesis)\u201d to refer to this latter concept, while I will \nuse \u201cbecoming\u201d alone to refer to the broader, non-terminological use. \n \nThe distinction may, at first glance, look like a repetition of the process-substance debate with \nchange taking the substance part and becoming the process part. However, it is not, for none \nof the ontologies I present here \u2013 from Thomas\u2019s \u201csubstance philosophy\u201d via Aristotle\u2019s in-\nbetween solution to Whitehead\u2019s \u201cprocess philosophy\u201d \u2013 forces the reader to choose between \n 19 \nthe one or the other aspect. Both change and becoming are necessary to make sense of the \nempirical world around us. The next section will dwell a bit more on the ontological \nreasoning behind this proposition.  \n \nOntological Oppositions \n \nHaving established the conceptual distinction between change and becoming, I now want to \ntake a closer look at the apparent ontological opposition of being and becoming, which lies at \nthe heart of the apparent incompatibility of the substance and the process view. Aristotle9 \nhimself is a good example for this struggle to mediate. Like every empirical scholar, he is \nbaffled by the ubiquity of change going on in the world. As we can see from his cosmology, \nwhere love, not inertia, makes the heavens move, he is convinced that there has to be a power, \nan active force behind that change. He calls it the \u201ccause\u201d (aitia) of the becoming of things, \nand stipulates that the search for causes is what science should be about. Hence, the major \nquestion is: What makes a thing become a thing? Aristotle\u2019s answer to that \u2013 to make matters \nshort \u2013 is: the essence10 (to ti \u00ean einai) of a thing. Now, we all know that essence is a four-\nletter word in poststructuralist times, but fortunately Aristotle understood essence in a \ndifferent way than we do today. The Greek term is to ti \u00ean einai, which translates as \u201cwhat it \nalways was to be\u201d11. Essence, for Aristotle, is an active principle of the \u201cbeing-in-becoming\u201d \nof a thing. In later chapters of the \u201cMetaphysics\u201d, he further characterises the essence as form \n(eidos, morph\u00ea), and again we must think of form as something active and creative. In \nAristotle\u2019s view, what makes a statue is not the material or matter, but the artist\u2019s vision of it. \nThis vision then shapes the material into a statue. What makes a house more than a heap of \nbricks \u2013 and more general, every whole more than the sum of its parts \u2013 is the plan, the \norganization of the material. The form is the soul of a thing, and indeed Aristotle uses the \n 20 \nsame definition for both, viz. the \u201cbeing-at-work-staying-the-same\u201d of an organized body \n(Sachs, 2001).  \n \nIn order to work change, however, form needs a continuum to work on. This continuum is \nprovided by the notion of matter (hyl\u00ea), and again for Aristotle hyl\u00ea is not matter in the \nmodern sense. Hyl\u00ea is neither material in the technical sense nor any other stuff, but a \nprinciple, a two-term relation to be used as \u201cx is the matter of y\u201d. The two-term or relational \nstructure of matter is Aristotle\u2019s answer to one of the major problems in any theory of \nbecoming: If water becomes ice or if a boy becomes a man, it does not make sense to say that \nat some moment the water resp. the boy perishes and the ice resp. the man is created ex nihilo. \nThere is a continuity in becoming, and to express this continuity Aristotle conceived of matter \nas the substrate (hypokeimenon)12 of becoming. The substrate is not an active being but a \nprinciple which, as relation, guarantees continuity between what was and what will become. \nAs ultimate principle of becoming, however, it cannot be described under the categories \nwhich describe being and must thus remain undefined. It is just the potential or disposition of \nthe entity waiting to be formed. An actual block of wood may contain the matter of a table, of \na wardrobe, of a door, but it is not that matter. And the matter only starts to take on \ncharacteristics \u2013 become recognisable \u2013 when the process of forming starts (see my above \nremarks on analysing potentials ex post facto). This transition from potentiality to actuality is, \nfor Aristotle, the most general definition of becoming. To sum, in order to describe the \nprocess of becoming, Aristotle introduces an active, forming principle (form or potential) to \ndrive the process, and a relational principle (matter or substrate) to guarantee continuity. \n \nIn the 20th century, the Aristotelian solution is taken up by Whitehead (Leclerc, 1993). It is \ninteresting to see that many scholars consider Aristotle a \u201csubstance theorist\u201d and Whitehead \na \u201cprocess theorist\u201d, although Whitehead basically uses the same combination of elements and \n 21 \nexplicitly refers to Aristotle when he introduces his concepts (e.g. Whitehead 1985:31). \nWatch closely how easy it is to turn a substance theory into a process theory (see also Table \n2). Whitehead reshuffles the Aristotelian notions of form and matter in order to give them a \nstronger process twist and make room for his own concept of creativity. Hence Aristotle\u2019s \n\u201cmatter\u201d becomes Whitehead\u2019s \u201ccreativity\u201d, the \u201cultimate notion of highest generality at the \nbase of actuality\u201d (Whitehead, 1985:31). Creativity, however, is not passive, but on the \ncontrary a \u201cpure notion of activity\u201d (Whitehead, 1985:31). Vice versa, form, as the formerly \nactive ingredient in Aristotelian thought, becomes passive and is now called \u201ceternal object\u201d. \nIt retains, however, its function of a potential determining actual states through its ingression \nin them. This conceptual reshuffle creates a new opposition \u201cpassive-potential versus active-\nactual\u201d, where Aristotle had conceptualised \u201cactive-potential versus passive-actual\u201d as \noppositions. As drab as it may seem, this is in fact where the difference between Aristotle the \nsubstance philosopher and Whitehead the process philosopher lies. For the unformed actuality \n\u2013 process - is now the creative and active part, while the individualising part \u2013 substance \u2013 is a \npassive potential for process to take on at will. The conceptual emphasis and ontological \nprerogative has shifted with the re-attribution of the active and passive role \u2013 not more. That \nis how close substance and process philosophies can become. Both need the notion of being, \nboth the notion of becoming for their respective systems, and indeed in quite a similar way: \n\u201c\u2026it belongs to the nature of a \u2018being\u2019 that it is a potential for every \u2018becoming\u2019.\u201d \n(Whitehead, 1985:23).  \n \nAnd like Aristotle, Whitehead immediately makes the link to relationality for in the very next \nsentence he states: \u201cThis is the \u2018principle of relativity\u2019.\u201d Like Aristotelian matter, \nWhiteheadian creativity relates every actual occasion to every other actual occasion. This \nhappens because every actual occasion that has finished its process of becoming immediately \nperishes and becomes a \u201cdatum\u201d, an unchangeable fact of the past. As a datum, it will then \n 22 \nenter every emerging actual occasion. Without this notion of ultimate connectedness \n(relationality, relativity) change, process or becoming cannot be conceptualised. \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nIn his conceptualisation of the process of becoming, Whitehead maintains Aristotle\u2019s \ndefinition of a transition from potentiality to actuality. Thus, Whiteheadian becoming \n(concrescence) is characterised by an actual occasion acquiring perfect determinateness \n(Whitehead, 1985:29). It starts out, so to speak, with many potentials, but in the course of \nconcrescence all these potentials are either actualised or not. At the end, there is no more \nroom for indecision or open possibilities; the actual occasion has become a fully determined \n\u201cfact\u201d that is not open to change any more.  \n \nThe transition from potentiality to actuality also plays a central role in the conceptualisation \nof Whiteheadian process as such. In fact, Christian (1959) claims that Whitehead sought to \nsubstitute the potentiality-actuality distinction for the being-becoming distinction as basis of \nhis ontology. Thus, the two major elements he takes to be existing are actual occasions, which \nrepresent perfect actualisations, and eternal objects, which are pure potentials (1985:22). \nTogether, these two elements \u201cmake\u201d being and becoming. In the process of concrescence, \nthe emerging actual occasion uses eternal objects to concretise itself. Once it is perfectly \nconcretised, it perishes and becomes a datum. As a datum, it then enters the concrescence of \nother actual occasions \u2013 the being as a potential for becoming. Eternal objects, because they \nare timeless, can function as linking pins between the individual actual occasions, thus \ncreating the \u201cstrings\u201d and \u201cwebs\u201d that make up enduring objects. Thus, to give a simple \nexample, Whitehead would reconstruct a blue ball as a series of occasions or perceptions. \n 23 \nEach occasion perishes immediately, but they are linked to form an enduring object by a \nnumber of eternal objects, such as the colour blue or the ball shape. \n \nIn conclusion, two major ideas may be taken from the three philosophers. The first is the \ndistinction between change and becoming. The second is to base the description of the process \nof becoming not on an opposition of substance\/process or being\/becoming, but on \nrelationality, activity, and the transition from potentiality to actuality.  \n \nOrganizational Process Theory \n \nHaving discussed some of the features of organizational process theory in the first part of the \npaper, I should now like to revisit one seminal paper (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002) in order to \nshow how my approach differs from their perspective on becoming and change. Like me, the \nauthors start from a critique of the Lewinian stage model of change to say that in models of \nthat type change is never really analysed because \u201cthe stages into which you analyze a change \nare states; the change itself goes on between them\u201d (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002:571, quoting \nWilliam James). They argue that instead of viewing change as a property of organizations, we \nshould take change to be ontologically prior to organization and view organization as \nemerging from change (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002:570). In order to reflect the ontological \npriority and pervasiveness of change, they suggest the notion of \u201corganizational becoming\u201d, \nwhich is then elaborated in the main part of the paper. Organizing, to them, is the creation of \nsomething more durable \u2013 i.e. forms or patterns \u2013 from the continuous flux (Tsoukas and \nChia, 2002:577), and this is mostly achieved through the creation of generalisations, types and \ncategories (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002:573ff., following Weick in this). Every stable item, \nhowever, is not truly enduring, but the outcome of permanent reproductive activity and in that \nsense precarious (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002:573). \n 24 \n \nWhile I agree with a number of insights from the paper, my approach differs in two respects. \nThe first is the assumption that change is not ontologically prior and \u201creflects becoming\u201d \n(Tsoukas and Chia, 2002:580) but that change (kin\u00easis) and becoming (genesis) are different \nconcepts, and that being and becoming are equiprimordial ontological concepts that are both \nneeded to explain change. My quarrel with Tsoukas and Chia is that if I take change to be the \nfirst and only ontological principle, I do not see how they can then explain that organization is \nemerging from change (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002:570), organization here defined as the \n\u201cmaking of form\u201d (Tsoukas and Chia, 2002:577). If we assume a kind of \u201cprimordial soup\u201d \nthat is entirely made of continuous change, where does form come from? It seems to be a kind \nof deus ex machina. Even if we take a view of patterns \u201cemerging\u201d from chaos, we would \nhave to assume some kind of memory or retention to be able to talk about \u201crecurrent patterns\u201d \nor \u201cself-enforcing loops\u201d \u2013 indeed to talk about \u201cpatterns\u201d and \u201cloops\u201d at all. Tsoukas and \nChia address the problem by explaining how cognitive categories (generalisations) emerge \nthat have a relatively stable core and a fluctuating periphery of meaning. As long as patterns \nof actions relate to the core, they tend to be stable. The categories can change over time, \nhowever, to the extent that the periphery brings in new meanings that may modify the core \nmeanings. While this idea in itself is absolutely comprehensible and descriptive of a number \nof empirical change processes, I have my doubts as to its ontological capacity. To start with, \nthe fact that it is derived from a philosophy of language approach does not help given this \nschool\u2019s reservations towards ontologies of the kind this paper is discussing (Wolf, 1984). \nSecond, just as with forms and patterns above, it remains ontologically unclear where these \ngeneralisations come from. The authors, drawing on Weick as well as on Berger and \nLuckmann, describe organizing as \u201cthe process of generating recurring behaviors through \ninstitutionalized cognitive representations. For an activity to be said to be organized, it implies \nthat types of behavior in types of situations are systematically connected to types of actors\u201d \n 25 \n(Tsoukas and Chia, 2002:573; italics in the original). However, where do types come from in \na continuously changing world? Would we not need some kind of repetition or resemblance to \nconstruct a type? And would that not presuppose some comparatively unchanging criterion of \ncomparison? \n \nMy approach, in contrast, recognises the fact that something permanent \u2013 call it forms, eternal \nobjects or whatever \u2013 is needed right from the start because it cannot be logically inferred \nfrom continuous change. In other words, organization cannot be conceptually developed from \nthe sort of ontology that Tsoukas and Chia suggest. It does not emerge from change. Neither \nis it stability as opposed to change. In my view, both change and organization are explananda \nor objects of analysis containing both \u201cfluid\u201d and \u201cfixed\u201d aspects. Both can be analysed from \ndifferent ontological perspectives: either from a substance view (with the problems discussed \nat the beginning), from a process view (with the problems discussed here and at the \nbeginning) or from the being-becoming view that I propose in this paper. \n \nOrganizational Change as Relationality and Activity \n \nThis final section will discuss what a model of organizational change that is based on being \nand becoming as equiprimordial can look like. As I have argued in the preceding sections, my \nappeal is to avoid Scylla and Charybdis by discarding both the \u201cnothing but being\u201d and \n\u201cnothing but becoming\u201d view. Instead we should adopt a model that integrates being and \nbecoming. In this model, becoming is the actualisation of potentialities that creates being from \nnon-being. Change is the actualisation of potentialities that creates a modified being from a \npreviously existing being. Change is ontologically characterised by two aspects that should \nshape the empirical research design on organizational change: relationality and activity. \n \n 26 \nRelationality refers to the retaining capacity in the process, the one that I have found lacking \nin the ontology of Tsoukas and Chia\u2019s account. Relationality links the different states in the \nprocess of change. It can do so in various ways. It can, first, link past, present and future \nstates, or it can, second, link contemporary \u201cneighbours\u201d through similarity or \ninterdependence. The former is something Chia and King (1998) have described as the \n\u201cprinciple of immanence\u201d, and Heidegger (1977) has called the \u201cecstasies\u201d (i.e. \u201creaching \nout\u201d) of temporality. The latter happens when, for example, an organizational field is \nconstructed, in which contemporary organizations are related through contracts, common \nissues or competition. Organizational identity is another relational feature using both the \nsynchronic and the diachronic aspect as it links the organization to its past and future but also \nlinks it to similar organizations by way of comparison. Relationality can, third, appear in \ndifferent modes. Hernes and Weik (2007) as well as Hernes (2008) list a number of examples, \nsuch as connectivity, recursiveness or programmes, but more may be found.  \n \nActivity is the creative capacity responsible for the innovative part of change. It is a \ncomparatively undetermined \u201cforce\u201d, a dispersed activity (e.g. Thompson, 1982), and not \nlimited to human agency. It fosters \u2013 and on this I agree with Tsoukas and Chia \u2013 continuous \nchange in the world. In their presentation of a dialectical perspective of strategic alliances, de \nRond and Bouchikhi (2004:66) describe such forces when they talk about alliances as \n\u201cheterogeneous phenomena that are continuously torn by multiple and contradictory forces \n[\u2026] The dialectical tensions that arise from the interplay of these forces are neither \nintrinsically functional nor dysfunctional (nor naturally geared towards stability or instability). \nThey are not there to serve an explicit or unconscious purpose. They just are.\u201d The \ncontradictory forces they refer to are, among others, competition vs. cooperation, vigilance vs. \ntrust, autonomy vs. control  (Bouchikhi, 1998) \u2013 an established catalogue from organization \n 27 \nstudies, but one that is often referred to only in the context of strategic (human) action instead \nof marking permanent forces that the organization is subjected to. \n \nAs I have already exposed the differences of this model to Tsoukas and Chia\u2019s, let me go back \nto the two papers discussed at the very beginning and show how my model differs from their \naccounts of organizational change. As we have seen, Barnett and Carroll (1995) use a time \nseries model where they look at the state of the organization in times t1, t2 and so on. Their \nnotion of change is based on a model of inertia \u2192 jump \u2192 inertia, which is characteristic of \nall change models using a punctuated equilibrium or similar logic (Hargrave and van de Ven, \n2006). My model, in contrast, would not see relationality and activity as alternating modes, \nbut as modes that are always present at the same time. They, in fact, have to be present at the \nsame time because the transition of potentiality to actuality needs both. (This is what Aristotle \nand Whitehead state with their form-matter argument, see table 2.) They are two sides of the \nsame coin. In the second paper, Greenwood and Hinings (1996) argue in the tradition of \nevolutionary approaches that the organization must accommodate the environment in order to \nsurvive. As I have pointed out earlier, the problem here is that organizations are hypostasised \ninto agents that do something in relation to the environment. In my model, in contrast, change \ncan be explained without turning organization into quasi-human agents since activity does not \npresuppose human action or human intent. Even if all human agents stopped acting for a \nmoment, the world \u2013 and organizations in it - would change in that moment. This does, of \ncourse, not mean that people cannot change organizations. They can, but their intentional \nchange comes on top of the changes that are already under way. The second problem of the \nevolutionary approach is the use of words like \u201caccommodate\u201d or \u201csurvive\u201d that, again, \nsuggest human agency in organizations. My model, in contrast, can rephrase the phenomenon \nunder the umbrella of relationality and thus avoids anthropomorphic language. What these \nwords are supposed to describe is the relation, or change in relation, between the organization \n 28 \nand the environment. If we conceptualise the organization as a bundle of relationships, we \nmight even get rid of the idea of  it being \u201cembedded\u201d in \u201cthe environment\u201d, which is either a \nquasi-biological or residual and in any case not very illuminating concept, as, for example, \nSandelands and Drazin (1989) have pointed out. \n \nSumming up, an empirical research design on organizational change that follows my model \nwould redirect the focus of the researcher from an inertia-jump model to parallel modes of \ninnovation and retention. It would redirect attention from human agency to various and \ndispersed forces propelling change, and might ask how they interact and interfere with \nstrategic human action. It would prevent the reification and anthropomorphization of the \norganization by viewing the organization as made up of relations and activity. Further \nresearch could and should then be done on different empirical forms of relationality and \nactivity. \n \nOdysseus\u2019 Tree \n \nTo summarise, when we analyse organizational processes and organizational change, I think it \nmakes sense, first, to distinguish between becoming (genesis) and change. Second, it is \nontologically sound to conceptualise being and becoming as equiprimordial, but it is, third \nand most importantly, even better to not use these terms at all and instead focus on \npotentiality, actuality, relationality and activity because these concepts can inform empirical \nwork on change. \n \nOn broader canvas, my intention was to sensitise readers to terminological differences (see \nTable 3) and towards the different \u201csorts\u201d of processes I have described in this paper. Due to \nthe long and winding conceptual history of the terms \u201cbeing\u201d, \u201cbecoming\u201d and \u201csubstance\u201d, \n 29 \nmy experience is that this sensitising is better achieved by focusing on more empirically \nrelevant notions instead of on being\/becoming and substance\/process.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \nHowever, this is just one suggestion among others. As I pointed out in the section \u201cThe swirl \nof history\u201d, there are not only two possible views on process, and at the end of this paper I \nwill not claim that there are only three. There is an indefinite number of solutions, but all \nshould be aware of the terminological differences in table 3 and the necessity to steer a \nstringent course in order to avoid Scylla and Charybdis. \n 30 \n \n \n \n \n \n  Aristotle Whitehead Thomas \nPure \nbecoming \nTerm Genesis Concrescence Creatio \nDefined as Potentiality \uf0e0 \nActuality \nPotentiality \uf0e0 \nActuality \nBeing = becoming \nCausa essendi = \ncausa fiendi \nTemporal \nstatus \nNot in time Not in time In time, but not \ndivisible \nChange Term Kin\u00easis Change Mutatio \nDefined as Being \uf0e0 Being Enduring object \uf0e0 \nEnduring object \nBeing \u2260 becoming \nCausa essendi \u2260 \ncausa fiendi \nTemporal \nstatus \nIn time In time In time, divisible \n \nTable 1: Pure Becoming versus Change \n \n 31 \n \n Aristotle Whitehead \nActive principle \nThat which pushed the process \nonwards \nForm Creativity \nRelational principle \nThat which guarantees continuity \nMatter Eternal objects \nPotentiality in Form Eternal objects \nActuality in Matter Actual occasions \nBecoming (pot \uf0e0 act) produced \nthrough \nForm shaping matter Actual occations taking on \neternal objects \nContinuity produced through Matter linking different \nparticulars \nEternal objects linking \ndifferent actual occasions \n \nTable 2: From Substance to Process Philosophy \n \n \nBeing \n\u2260 \nSubstance \nBeing Existence \nBeing Stability \nBecoming not-Being \nBecoming Change \n \nTable 3: Mind the Gap \n 32 \nNotes \n \n1 In order to avoid confusion, I will refer to authors propagating a strong process view in organization studies as \n\u201cprocess theorists\u201d.  A strong process view takes process to be ontologically prior to substance, whereas weak \nprocess views analyse process without such an ontological assumption. Philosophers advocating a process \nmetaphysics will be referred to as \u201cprocess philosophers\u201d.   \n2 Textual evidence for this position can be found, apart from the initial quote in the authors\u2019 citing Hannan and \nFreeman: \u201c\u2026although organizations sometimes manage to change positions on these [core] dimensions, such \nchanges are rare and costly and seem to subject an organization to greatly increased risks of death.\u201d (Barnett and \nCarroll, 1995:224). Note the spatial expression \u201cchange positions\u201d. \n3 Critical realists of Whitehead\u2019s time were Santayana and Lovejoy, later Sellars. They agreed with Kant that our \nperceptions were mediated, but thought it nevertheless possible to infer real structures and qualities from them.  \n4 Second, transcendence is not possible for Whitehead because, in contrast to Kant, the subject that constitutes \nthe object is not the same as the subject that perceives this object (Ford, 1998). The subject (actual occasion) that \nconstitutes the object by unifying multiple prehensions perishes the very moment this constitution is completed. \nThe perception of the object thus constituted is left to the next actual occasion. There is, in effect, no continuing \nsubject that could reflect on what it has done. \n5 Martin Heidegger (2004:283) once referred to it as \u201cthe most difficult thing that ever had to be thought in \nWestern metaphysics.\u201d \n6 There are, of course, differences between them from a philosophical point of view. These are, however, not \nrelevant for the problems discussed in this paper. \n7 Kin\u00easis literally translates as \u201cmovement\u201d, but Aristotle reserves the word not only for changes in location, but \nalso for changes in quality or quantity. \n8 Whitehead also uses a logical-mathematical argument that I will not introduce. For a more detailed discussion \nsee Hammerschmidt (1984) \n9 For a very accessible introduction to Aristotle\u2019s thoughts on this, see Meikle (1985). An in-depth discussion of \nthe Aristotelian notion of matter as compared to modern notions see Suppes {, 1974 #2554}. \n \n10 \u201cEssence\u201d is the Latin translation of the Greek concept. Sachs (2001), however, echoes the concern of many \nAristotelian scholars when he says that Latinizing translators have turned Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics into \n\u201cgibberish\u201d. See also the next footnote. \n 33 \n \n11 The expression has puzzled many scholars, who prefer the more obvious to ti esti (\u201cwhat it is\u201d) Aristotle also \nuses sometimes. However, I think that the first term brilliantly covers the temporal, i.e. non-static, effort of every \nstable thing to remain recognisable through all processes of change. \n12  In the subsequent history of philosophy, there have been a number of misinterpretations and errors in \ntranslation, which resulted in a confusion between \u201esubstance\u201c and \u201esubstrate\u201c (Halfwassen et al., 1998). \n 34 \nReferences \n \n\u2018Scylla and Charybdis\u2019.
