The case study application is in mass market electronic products; the potential application is wide.\nKeywords: Requirements Management; Return Merchandise Authorization; Maintenance Service; Consumer\nProducts\n1 Introduction\nCustomer satisfaction is a prime goal for any sustainable business organization. A quality product and good\ncustomer service are elements in satisfying customers. Worldwide production continues to shift between the\nestablished centres in Europe and North America and the newly emergent production platform of Asia. In the\nmid-1970s the changes in manufacturing industry dynamics operating across the global marketplaces of North\nAmerica, Europe, Japan and some other Far East nations were widely recognised. The rise of India and China\nas manufacturing centres is a recent phenomenon. There are many wild predictions about the potential impact\non established Western manufacturing business models, but we can already look to other nations to assess the\npotential impact in the longer term, (Sackett et al, 2005). Leading edge companies producing high technology\nproducts in the Far East have moved beyond the base physical product and are also providing technological\nservices, product planning and support to customers. This, linked with rising customer expectation and\nmarket acceptance hurdles, has had a major impact on the classic maintenance service model in which the\nmass market industries normally recognise little or no relation of service to the high technology product\nmarketing strategy. In our case study enterprise the Original Equipment Manufacturer with no market\npresence under their own label, mass manufacturing high end consumer electronic models centrally in the Far\nEast, are servicing the product in high labour cost, local to market, remote from the Company\u2019s headquarters\nlocations and in support of other firms\u2019 brand names and customers. The Company has grown to a turnover\napproaching 2 billion Euros in 8 years. The maintenance service must fulfil customer satisfaction in high\ntechnology and short life-cycle product, demanding consumer electronics markets. Maintenance service has\nincreasingly become a proactive, complex, and perpetuating process that can support more revenue generating\nopportunities than the direct sale of the products themselves. A challenge for the mass market high\ntechnology product sector is the provision of a global and customised service network. Requirements\nManagement techniques have been established in software engineering and new product development\napplications (Chen et al, 2004). The authors propose that Requirements Management techniques be modified\nand used to identify the stakeholders and prioritise the potentially conflicting needs in this emerging\nenvironment of maintenance service for high technology global products.\nIn this paper the authors identify a research gap in the application of requirements management by:\n\uf06e Identifying the stakeholders for global return merchandise service of the high end electronics\nconsumer product market, and\n\uf06e demonstrating the potential application of a requirements driven system in a maintenance service\ndomain.\nThe practical application and development of this requirements management derived system interface with a\ncompany\u2019s internal reporting system is described. This provides a single document customer reporting system.\nThe specific and specialised product maintenance requirements of a rapidly growing and highly successful\nmanufacturer trading in a global market are detailed through a case study. The means to implement a\nrequirements management based service system are illustrated. The discussion highlights the key findings\nand the scope for application of the research to associated sectors with similar service characteristics. It is\nanticipated that this application area will grow substantially.\n2 Stakeholders and Customers requirements\nThe word \u2018requirement\u2019 is applied loosely in both the engineering and wider communities. Usage normally\naddresses requirements in the context of a physical product, and requirements are used to derive product\ndevelopment \u2013 not use, particularly in large projects, and disregarding requirements for after sales services. A\nrequirement is:\n\u201cA statement identifying a capability, physical characteristic, or quality factor that bounds a product or\nprocess need for which a solution will be pursued.\u201d (IEEE Std 1220-1994), and \u201cCharacteristics that\nidentify the accomplishment levels needed to achieve specific objectives for a given set of conditions\u201d,\n(EIA\/IS-632). Non-functional requirements: specify an aspect of the system other than capacity to do\nthings. Examples include those relating to performance, accessibility, usability, branding and visual\nstyle. Functional requirements: specify what the system must be able to do, it terms that are\nmeaningful to its users (Hooks, 1994).\nRequirement classification enables the product team to assess the difficulties associated with changing a\nrequirement. By definition, if it is a primary requirement a Contract Change, or perhaps a new market\nanalysis, will be required. If it is a derived requirement, the decision to change (as long as the change is\nwithin the scope of the \"parent\" primary requirement) rests with programme management.\nPatterns and templates for the requirements definitions are targeted to new product development and software\nengineering (Robertson et al, 1999, and Gilb, 2005). The output elements of the service requirements are not\nproduct specifications but instead the process and quality issues. Maintenance service output is a series of\nactivities, processes and targets, not a physical item. The service requirements do include some physical\nitems such as repair materials, equipments and tools but customer concerns are items such as quantity,\navailability and cost. Here, the product specification is fixed, unchangeable; also it belongs to the customer.\nThe time-to-market for the service delivery is much shorter than the product development time. A new\nproduct development team deal with one product, but a service project deals with many products and each\nproduct service has different requirements. The classic requirements definitions do not fully embrace the\nvolatile and highly customer driven process of a mass market, high technology product Maintenance and\nService Environment.\nThe stakeholder management literature can be traced back to the seminal work of Freeman (1984), who\narticulated a \u2018stakeholder model\u2019 to replace the \u2018managerial model\u2019 of the firm. He distinguishes two senses\nof the Stakeholders:\nThe \u2018narrow definition\u2019 includes those groups who are vital to the survival and success of the\ncorporation. The \u2018wide definition\u2019 includes any group or individual who can affect or is affected by\nthe corporation (Freeman, 1997).\nThe development of stakeholder theories of the corporation has revived debates about the ambit of corporate\nresponsibilities (Cragg, 1996); different perspectives provide different views of stakeholders (Cragg, 2002). It\nalso shows the different groups of stakeholders as Customers, Employees, Shareholders, Security, regulators\nand government officials, Communities. The authors propose the Competitors can also be a stakeholder as\ntheir business strategy always affects the company. Customer needs will be the core requirements, to satisfy\ncustomers we must understand how to find out what they need \u2013 the requirements. From the view of\nrequirements management, the requirements from the external customer will be the most critical. Yoji Akao\n(1990) distinguished three classes of customer wants:\nI. \u201cWhat customers say they want\u201d. Customer demands are frequently translated into specifications\nwithout exploring their meaning in regard to how the product or service will be used. Neglecting to\nexplore how the customer intends to use the product or service can lead to poor or improper design.\nII. \u201cThe customer's expected quality consists of expectations the customer does not verbalize because\nthey assume them to be evident: such as the product must be safe\u201d. Extensive interviews may not\nelicit these expectations. Customers will be dissatisfied if the product or service does not meet these\nassumed expectations. If the expectations are built into the product, customers will hardly notice.\nIII. \u201cExciting quality consists of attributes of the product or service contributed by the supplier\u201d. The\ncustomer may not expect these characteristics; they recognize them as improvements and like them.\n3 Maintenance Service\nMaintenance service models can be split by value \/ volume in a simplistic tri-segmentation:\n\uf06e High value - Low volume\nThose products are normally high acquisition cost, long life-cycle, high technology and high\nperformance; the service maintenance costs may subsequently exceed the purchase price. For\nexample, a commercial aero engine may cost 8 million Euros, yet over the typical 20 years plus\nlifecycle the overhaul costs will be more than the list price. This is in addition to the on schedule\nand unscheduled maintenance service. The product will be fully functional throughout its\nserviceable life. The high capital value and cost of failure requires well organized maintenance\nservice by certified organisations.\n\uf06e High value \u2013 High volume\nExamples include high technology products, such as Personal Computer, Laptop, Personal Data\nAssistant and high function mobile phone. Market value is time sensitive. The products exhibit high\nvalue to weight ratios. Service life-cycle may be months or years; production lifecycle can be weeks\nor months. Second owners may have different service expectations. Service provision may be short\nduration and then ad hoc.\n\uf06e Low value \u2013 High volume\nThis kind of product is low margin and market share is price sensitive. Typical mid range examples\ninclude standard domestic white goods. Product life-cycle may be 10+ years, production life may be\n6 months. At the lower end or after a brief warranted service life the product may not have any\nservice offered.\nThe buyer may be able to select the maintenance service model. The manufacture may list different\nmaintenance packages to satisfy the customer requirements. Outside the High value \u2013 Low volume sector,\neven if no contract is offered there is always the warranty period during which the provider (Liden et al, 2003)\nwill need to assure the product. Failure symptoms, once accepted as not caused by the customer, will need to\nbe accommodated, probably at no charge. The product provider will need a maintenance service model to\nfulfil the customer\u2019s legal entitlement. The maintenance process is currently viewed as quite simple. The\nsense is that the repaired product will be close to the performance of the original manufacture standard. It will\nnot be a better or different product. The market perception is that a repaired product is not \u2018as good as new\u2019.\nRepaired product may be sold as \u2018graded\u2019 \u2018refurbished\u2019, indicating possible sub standard operation or life.\n3.1 High technology products maintenance service\nAs high technology products become complex, the role of supporting services needed to exploit product\nfunction is increasingly important. To achieve the performance to specification customers are entering into\nservice contracts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers or independent service providers. Aspects such\nas what services to deliver, who is to deliver them, how they are to be delivered and received, and at what\nperformance level, need to be considered in the negotiation process and agreed upon by both the provider and\nthe client. Thomas (1975) distinguished between equipment-based and people-based services. Examples of\nequipment-based services include airlines and vending machines, examples of people-based service are\nappliance repair and management consultants. For the maintenance models, different types of product have a\ndifferent maintenance model. van de Water (2000) identified the maintenance service as broadly of two\ntypes, non built-in maintenance and built-in maintenance; for each type we can further classify Preventive\nbased and Failure based maintenance. Even so it is hard to find universal models applicable across different\nmaintenance service environments.\n3.2 Requirements of a maintenance system \u2013 case study environment\nThe case study company provides \u2018Personal Digital Assistant\u2019 phone and \u2018Smartphone\u2019 Maintenance Service\nthrough a centre in the United Kingdom. They can service up to a few thousand units per month from this\nlocation. The customers include all major telecom operators some with up to a dozen types of products. They\nrepresent many million end users. The major challenges in the global maintenance service centre are Turn-\nAround-Time and Repeat-Return-Rate. These are the indicators of the service delivery performance. The\nhigh technology product market does not normally allowed end users to repair the product themselves \u2013 this\nwould invalidate the warranty. To fulfil these requirements the sub-requirements can be classified as:\n\uf06e Customer interface: (a) for end user, when a customer walks into an Authorized Service Centre, the\nproduct is examined for defects. The fault is classified into 3 categories. Level 1 and Level 2 faults\ncan be repaired by the Authorised Service Centre itself but the product with Level 3 fault has to be\nsent to the Authorized Repair Centre. Each fault is assigned a fault coded which determines the\nnature of the repair and the materials needed for repair. (b) For the retailer, a service programme\nmanager must be assigned for each retailer as the Return Material Authorization process is complex.\n\uf06e Delivery: customers may use different delivery companies. The management system must consider\ndelivery requirements in the contract.\n\uf06e Environmental: anti-static and dust free are requirements. For mobile phone maintenance the\navailable radio signal strength is a requirement.\n\uf06e Logistics: the forecast requirements need to be defined by the material planner and suppliers which\nis normally a multi-destination air-land transportation supply chain for global maintenance service\n(Li et al, 2005). The Enterprise Resource Planning system may be able to help, but will probably\nnot provide the precision needed.\n\uf06e Safety: safety requirements for the products but also for the staff including the moving lines,\nequipment, the limitation of the height and weight, etc.\n\uf06e Quality: customers expect the product to be as it comes out from original manufacture, or better.\nThe quality is measured by the repeat return rate but continuous improvement and high frequency\nupgrading in the product provide opportunities for customers to question quality.\n\uf06e Warehouse: the hardware and software requirements for the warehouse management need to meet\nthe customer requirement that their products will not mix with other competitor or faulty products.\n\uf06e Technical: requirements for the repair technique and instructions for the repair engineer on each\nproduct, the customer will need technical support as the products are complex. (For these products\nthe no fault found rate is around 30%).\n\uf06e Equipment: new product introduction must also include new repair equipment requirements and the\ntechnician skills requirements.\n\uf06e Information system: the basic system includes the Enterprise Resource Planning and the Return\nMerchandise Authorisation system. ERP system to control the material and goods in\/out. RMA\nsystem to keep the maintenance repair record and generate the reports.\n\uf06e Regulation: the different global locations each have different regulations. These may also come\nfrom the customer requirements, such as ISO9000:2000, the customer will normally prefer to deal\nwith an ISO certificated company.\n\uf06e Financial: through the repair reports, the maintenance service centre can claim the cost from the\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer, Customer or End User. The incorrect financial reports will\ncause transfer delay which may cause a financial crisis in a small medium maintenance service\ncentre.\n4 Data Collection\nTo identify the stakeholders in the high technology electronic maintenance service industry, the authors\ninvestigated the operations of 4 separate global companies. In-depth personal interviews comprised of open-\nended questions were conducted in each firm. The executives were selected from operations, senior\nmanagement, and customer relations because each of these areas could have an impact on requirements in the\nmaintenance service company. The respondents held titles such as general manager, department leader,\nservice programme manager, customer service relation, senior engineer and technical support. Ten executives\nwere interviewed about a broad range of service requirements issues (e.g. what they perceived the\nrequirements are and how they manage the requirements).\nA Requirements Engineering process is a structured set of activities which are followed to derive, validate and\nmaintain a systems requirements document. The process activities consist of four main activities that are\nperformed repeatedly in an iterative fashion. These are, (Tseng et al, 1997):\n\uf06e Requirements elicitation: eliciting customer needs and acquiring the voice of the customers.\n\uf06e Requirements analysis: the process of interpreting customer needs and deriving explicit\nRequirements that can be understood and interpreted by people and\/or computer programs.\n\uf06e Requirements tracking: involves continuous interchange and negotiation within a project team\nregarding conflicting and changing objectives.\n\uf06e Requirements verification: embodies the procedures for determining whether or not a product or\nprocess complies with a designated set of Requirements.\nThese steps are not all-inclusive. Many companies have additional steps and requirements. But generally the\nbasic steps are similar across industries. The key differences are not in the names of the similar steps, but in\nthe order, length, repetition of, reviews, and information exchanges between the steps.\nTo means to adopt requirements technology is not clearly described in the literature and successful\nimplementations are hard to find. One needs to choose a process that fits the lifecycle requirements of the\nsystem, tailor that standard to fit the system\u2019s specific requirements, and then apply it. A more precise\ndefinition is the process defined by INCOSE RWG (Requirements Working Group), Figure 1. The rational\nsteps: Capture, Analyze, Specify, Verify & Validate, and Manage the Requirements, should be followed in\nsequence.\n[Insert Figure 1 about here]\n4.1 Model of a high tech product maintenance service centre\nThe Return Merchandise Authorisation maintenance service centre is typically organised into departments,\nFigure 2: Repair Centre, Logistics, Service Programme Manager, Maintenance Information System,\nAdministration and Finance.\n[Insert Figure 2 about here]\nRepair Centre\nThis Department is organised into: handset and motherboard repair centres. The handset repair centre carries\nout repair of incoming telephones. After diagnosing the handsets, defective parts are replaced by new parts in\nstock, the defective parts are then sent to the motherboard centre. The motherboard centre carries out the\nrepair of parts coming from handset centre as well as defective parts coming directly from customers. This\ndepartment is where the Company produces added value, repairing the handsets and defective parts. The\nDepartment has important relationships with most other departments.\nLogistics\nIncoming receiving, incoming check, warehousing, purchasing, material planner\/controller, shipping\npersonnel are all in this department. Logistics is also a key department in the daily activity of the Company\nand works closely with the other departments.\nService programme manager\nIts function is to coordinate with the Taiwan Headquarter Service Programme Manager Department for all\nservices projects development and ensure the transfer of repair knowledge and the repair service preparation\ngoes smoothly. SPM works closed with the repair centre supporting and developing new projects, and with\nlogistics providing forecasting information from customers.\nThe major customer focused processes identified are: Customer contact, receiving, repair, testing, packing,\nfull package inspection and shipping.\n4.2 Stakeholder requirements analysis method\nA stakeholder analysis can identify and assess the importance of key people, groups of people, or institutions\nthat may significantly influence the success of the activity or project. The authors modify this technique and\nuse it to:\n\uf06e Identify the stakeholders that will influence Company initiatives (positively or negatively).\n\uf06e Capture the kind of requirements.\n\uf06e Develop strategies to get the most effective support possible and reduce any obstacles to\nsuccessfully fulfil stakeholders requirements.\nThis then develops a Stakeholder Requirements Analysis Matrix, Table I.\nOnce you have a list of all potential stakeholders consider the role the key requirements for each stakeholder\nmust play for the project to be successful, and the likelihood that the stakeholder will play this role. The\nlikelihood and impact of a stakeholder's negative response to the Company. Assign A for extremely\nimportant, B for fairly important, and C for not very important. Record these letters in the column entitled\n\"Assessment of Impact.\" The final step is to consider the kinds of things that you could do to get stakeholder\nsupport and reduce opposition. Consider how you might approach each of the stakeholders. What kind of\ninformation will they need? How important is it to involve the stakeholder in the planning process? Are there\nother groups or individuals that might influence the stakeholder to support your initiative? Record your\nstrategies for obtaining support or reducing obstacles to your project in the last column in the matrix.\n5 Findings\nBeing a customer is about pleasure, happiness and satisfaction. In our case study the Requirement Derived\nService Maintenance domain for high technology electronic product maintenance provides special needs. The\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer has more than 50 Authorised Service Providers. The case study company\nis one of the Approved Service Providers owned by the manufacturer. The characteristic of their product is\nhigh technology, high value and high control needed to manage the quality and the technology. The\ntechnology needs continuing engineering change so the maintenance service environment is dynamic. The\nquality of maintenance is constantly challenged because the technology is unstable; there are frequent re-\nengineering tasks such as Operating System or firmware upgrades. This re-engineering needs to be done\nduring the service maintenance. Such maintenance will not be included in the customer requirements but will\nbe defined by the provider\u2019s requirements. The cost of service maintenance is an ongoing concern.\n5.1 Stakeholders\nThe requirements should be classified by the stakeholders (Chen et al, 2005). In our case study the\nstakeholders can be distinguished as external and internal. The End-users, Customers, Co-operators, Re-\nseller, Bank, Mother Company, Courier, Regulators, and the competitors are the external stakeholders. The\nService Programme Manager, Customer Service Relation, Repair Centre, Warehouse and Finance\ndepartments are the internal stakeholders, see Figure 3. They all have different requirements for the\nmaintenance service process.\n[Insert Figure 3 about here]\n5.2 Requirements management\nUnlike product design, these maintenance requirements will be dynamic. The requirements in maintenance\nprocess will need to be audited continuously. For the high technology electronic product there is no\nscheduled maintenance programme; rather a refurbishment reengineering programme.\nAll stakeholder requirements will need to be combined and incorporated. The formats of requirements will be\nextensive and comprise many types of information format such as a phone call, an email, a document, a photo\nand the type of requirement could be a document, a process, equipment, an engineer or even a place\/location.\nCustomers have expectations about what they will receive from the maintenance service delivery. These\nexpectations are beliefs about future events that, when compared with the perceived actual maintenance\nservice delivered, influence satisfaction and assessments of overall service quality. To deal with the\nrequirements for the maintenance service, the case study company launched a project led by the Service\nProgramme Manager. The project team members comprised the entire set of internal customers who\naccording the external customer requirements, generated the internal requirements.\nFor each category, there are lists of sub requirements. The requirements examples are shown in Table II. The\nproject team defined the owner of the requirement item who will need to respond to this requirement, the date\nwhen it can be finished, and how it can be realised, Table III.\nBy using this kind of simple method, the project team can fulfil the requirements at the base level. The\nnumbering helps to trace the requirements; the classification will limit the search area. This functionality can\neasily be managed by information system products familiar to most office users. The large number of\nrequirements presents a challenge to management control. The changes will normally impact the whole\nprocess; the team need to analysis the impact of the requirements and propose a solution which needs to be\ncomprehensive for internal and external customers.\n5.3 Application and development\nThe authors developed system has been installed by the Company and combined with the weekly report.\nThese have been combined with the weekly reports to reduce management time spent at meetings and deal\nwith the various formats of the report documents provided by different customers. All customer accounts are\nnow presented in the same format from different files created by the service account manager but maintained\nby all the project team member-internal stakeholders. The same format of report helps the reviewer and team\nfamiliar with the management system to jump between different customer management reports. This report\nand the management control table has become the standard, customer driven requirements management\ncontrol table. The freeze, sorting, and filter functions of the EXCEL file are widely used to monitor the\nmanagement reports. This combination can help the requirements communication between the service\nstakeholders. The stakeholders can easily add and manage the requirements through the authorised permit.\nAll the maintenance service requirements have been classified in each sheet. Each sheet has a stakeholder\nwho checks and updates the status before the daily review meeting using the colouring system, red, yellow\nand green to show the urgency level (Figure 4 and 5). There is a specific owner responsible for each of the\nrequirements. We have included the column \u201csupport by\u201d to clarify the second owner for certain specific\nrequirements.\n[Insert Figure 4 about here]\n[Insert Figure 5 about here]\n6 Conclusion\nThe maintenance service environment across enterprise sectors is increasingly complex and differentiated.\nService models now need to be adaptable. Many kinds of service and maintenance delivery models are now\nfully customised and regularly re-customised. The traditional maintenance service process has been specified\nand controlled by the manufacturer. Now service may be controlled by the Original Design Manufacturer,\nAuthorised Service Providers, multiple Customers or users.\nIn some sectors maintenance service has been seen as a low priority. In high technology products good\nmaintenance service models can provide significant business benefits by, for example, allowing reduced time-\nto-market in unstable technology applications and upgrading the product via service activities in the field.\nThis service environment can provide re-furbished product to better than original performance specification or\nre start product life.\nThe requirements from stakeholders in high technology electronic product can be classified and ranked by the\nrequirements analysis matrix, control and managed by the requirements control table. By this methodology it\nis possible to satisfy the stakeholder requirements and set up a customised requirements derived maintenance\nservice process. The stakeholder and customer requirements can be managed and controlled by this\nrequirements management technique and managed faster, more effectively and potentially cheaper. The\nrequirements management based system can readily be combined with conventional management reporting\nsystems to provide enhanced functionality of the rapidly developing maintenance service domain.\nReferences\nChen, Y.
