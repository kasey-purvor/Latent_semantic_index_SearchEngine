The effect of solvent on the \nfluorescent properties of this calixarene in the presence of PA has been studied, and \ndemonstrates that varying solvent polarity allows the wavelength of enantiomer selectivity to \nbe tuned from 227nm to 440nm. While enantiomeric selectivity is observed in methanol at \n227nm, no discrimination is achieved in acetonitrile. Chiral discrimination is statistically \npossible with L1 and PA in chloroform at 227nm, but it is not comparable with the extent of \ndiscrimination achieved in methanol. In chloroform a new emission band at a longer \nwavelength (440nm) is formed with R- PA in solution with L1, an effect that is not observed \nwith the S-enantiomer. This new band in chloroform at 440nm allows very effective chiral \ndiscrimination and has been attributed to the presence of two different conformations of \ncalixarene L1, which is reinforced by 1H-NMR studies and molecular modelling studies.  \n__________________________________________________________________________ \nKeywords: fluorescent calixarene, molecular sensor, chiral discrimination, solvent effect. \n \n \n \n                                               \n\u2217\n To whom correspondance should be addressed; e-mail: dermot.diamond@dcu.ie \n 2 \nIntroduction \nDetermination of enantiomeric composition is important due to both the role of chirality in \nmany biological processes1 and to increasing restrictions on the composition of \npharmaceuticals, whose efficacy is dependent upon a chiral moiety2, 3. Chiral molecules have \nidentical physical and chemical properties, and differ only in their interactions with polarised \nlight and other chiral entities. Our aim was to develop a molecular sensor, which could \ndistinguish enantiomers of a chiral guest molecule. In order to fulfil its role, the molecular \nsensor must possess several essential features: (i) Functional groups must be present that bind \nreversibly with the target guest species, for example; hydrogen bonding groups or acidic\/basic \ngroups. (ii) These groups must be spatially pre-organised in order to provide the required \nselectivity. (iii) A quantifiable signal must be generated by the host\u2013guest interaction4. \nPossible options for signalling include electrochemical (e.g. potentiometry, amperometry) and \nspectroscopic (e.g. fluorescence, absorbance) methods. (iv) The groups conferring recognition \nand signal transduction must be arranged in an interactive conformation, so that binding with \na target species results in signal generation. \nCalixarenes are cyclic oligomers that have an upper rim, defined by the para \nsubstituents of the phenolic rings and a lower rim defined by the phenolic hydroxy groups. \nDerivatisation of calixarenes at the upper and lower rim is desirable to introduce various types \nof functional groups, to increase their usefulness as new host molecules. Much of the \nanalytical interest in calixarenes derives from their potential as selective and useful \ncomplexation agents, with the main area of interest to date being their use as molecular \nsensors\n5\n. This depends in part on the presence of appropriately sized cavities however for the \nmore sophisticated recognition mechanisms it is also necessary that appropriate functional \ngroups are present in a spatial arrangement that is complementary to binding sites in the guest \nmolecule (i.e. shape-based recognition rather than size-based). The synthesis of calixarene L1 \n(Figure 1) was previously described6. This molecular sensor incorporates a fluorescent \nnaphthyl moiety, the necessary fluorophore for optical transduction, in proximity to hydrogen \nbonding and chiral centres in the host molecule in such a way that binding of the guest species \nresults in quenching of the fluorescence.  \nThe efficiency of the quenching of a fluorescent species by a quenching species \nfollows the Stern-Volmer relationship if the fluorophore and quencher concentrations are in \nthe appropriate range: where I0 is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of the quencher, I \nis the fluorescence intensity in the presence of quencher at a concentration [Q], and KSV is the \nStern-Volmer constant. KSV is a measure of quenching efficiency,7 and a large value for this \nparameter equates to a sensitive response. Ideally, the aim is to obtain a material that displays \n 3 \na large KSV for one enantiomer and zero for the other (no quenching effect). This material \ncould subsequently be employed as an optical sensor. \nI0\/I = 1 + KSV[Q]      (1) \nFluorescence emission spectra are widely variable and depend on the chemical \nstructure of the fluorophore and also the nature of solvent employed. In general, only \nfluorophores that are polar in nature will display a large sensitivity to solvent polarity, with \nnon-polar molecules such as hydrocarbons, showing much less sensitivity to solvent polarity8. \nIn previous work it has been shown that calixarenes9, 10, 11, 12 and more recently fluorescent \ncalixarenes13, 14, 15 can discriminate between enantiomers.  Here we present how solvent \npolarity has an effect not only on the extent of enantiomeric discrimination, but also on the \nwavelength at which discrimination occurs. \n \nExperimental Section \nEquipment and Materials \nAll fluorescence emission and quenching experiments were performed using a \nPerkin-Elmer Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50B (Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK), \ninterfaced with a Pentium PC, which employs fluorescence data management software, \nFLWinlab. Post-run data processing was performed using Microsoft Excel \u201997 and 2000 after \nimporting the spectra as ASCII files.  \nAll fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed using an Edinburgh \nAnalytical Instruments Single Photon Counter in a T-setting, which employs a nanosecond \nnitrogen flash-lamp nF900, with photo-multiplier detector, model S300 (-20\u00b0C to -30\u00b0C). \nPost-run data processing was performed using a Pentium PC, F900 data correlation program, \nversion 3.13 and Microsoft Excel 2000 after importing the spectra as ASCII files.  \nAll UV measurements were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 \nUV\/VIS\/NIR spectrometer. The instrument was controlled via UV WinLab software and post-\nrun data processing was performed using Microsoft Excel \u201997 and 2000 after importing the \nspectra as ASCII files. \nBoth enantiomers of phenylalaninol, (R)-(+)-phenylalaninol and (S)-(-)-\nphenylalaninol were of puriss grade (98% pure, the other 2% consisting of the other \nenantiomeric form), obtained from Fluka Biochemika (Gillingham, Dorset, UK). In addition \nas a control, this chiral amine was obtained of puriss grade from Sigma-Aldrich. The solvents \n 4 \nused (methanol, acetonitrile and chloroform - HPLC grade (fluorescence emission) and \nSpectrometric grade (lifetime measurements)) were obtained from Labscan (Stillorgan, Co. \nDublin). The synthesis of calixarenes L16 and L216 have been described previously.  \nPreparation of solutions for Fluorescence Measurements \nSolutions giving concentrations of the propranolol amide calix[4]arene L1 (0.7-\u00b5mol dm-3) \nand phenylalaninol in the range 1 \u2013 25-mmol dm-3 in methanol were prepared as follows. A \n0.1-mmol dm-3 stock solution of calixarene L1 was prepared by dissolving 8.9 mg in 50mL of \nmethanol. A 0.25-mol dm-3 stock solution of phenylalaninol was prepared by dissolving the \nrequired combination of the two enantiomers, totalling 0.945 g, in 25mL of methanol. Test \nsolutions were prepared by taking 70\u00b5L of the calixarene stock solution in a 10mL volumetric \nflask, adding 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0mL of phenylalaninol stock solution, and making up \nto the volume with methanol. The fluorescence emission of the solutions was measured at an \nexcitation wavelength of 227nm, and the emission intensities were measured at 340nm.  \nSolutions giving concentrations of L1 (3.0-\u00b5mol dm-3) and phenylalaninol (in the \nrange 1 \u2013 20-mmol dm-3) in acetonitrile, and L1 (5.0-\u00b5mol dm-3) and phenylalaninol (in the \nrange 1 \u2013 44-mmol dm-3) in chloroform, were prepared as described for experiments in \nmethanol. The fluorescence emission of these solutions was measured at an excitation \nwavelength of 285nm, and the emission intensities were measured at 340nm.  Measurements \nwere repeated a minimum of three times for each addition.  \nProcedure for Fluorescence Measurements of di-functionalised R-propranolol \namide calix[4]arene in Methanol \nSolutions giving concentrations of the R-propranolol diamide calix[4]arene L2 (0.7-\u00b5mol dm-\n3) and phenylalaninol in the range 1 \u2013 20-mmol dm-3 in methanol were prepared as follows. A \n0.1-mmol dm-3 stock solution of calixarene L2 and 0.25-mol dm-3 stock solutions of \nenantiomers of phenylalaninol were prepared as previously described. Test solutions were \nprepared by taking 70\u00b5L of the calixarene stock solution in a 10mL volumetric flask, adding \n0 - 0.8mL of phenylalaninol stock solution, and making up to the volume with methanol. The \nfluorescence emission of the solutions was measured at an excitation wavelength of 227nm, \nand fluorescence intensities were measured at 340nm.  Measurements were repeated a \nminimum of three times for each addition. \n 5 \nPreparation of solutions for Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements  \nSolutions giving absorbance readings at 300nm of 0.474 of the calix[4]arene L1 and therefore \na concentration of 56.1-\u00b5mol dm-3 in methanol were prepared. Extinction coefficient (\u03b5300nm) \nof L1 is 8449 dm3 mol-1 cm-1. Each sample was spiked with the R-enantiomer of \nphenylalaninol and the consequent fluorescence lifetime was measured. The concentration \nrange of R-phenylalaninol examined after an addition of 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40\u00b5L of the 1.0-\nmol dm-3 stock solution of R-phenylalaninol was 4-16-mmol dm-3. Solutions giving \nabsorbance readings of 0.453 of L1 and therefore a concentration of 53.6-\u00b5mol dm-3 in \nmethanol were prepared and measured, and were spiked with the S-enantiomer of \nphenylalaninol in the same general procedure as in the case of the R-enantiomer. \nSolutions giving absorbance readings of 0.570 of L1 and therefore a concentration of \n44.9-\u00b5mol dm-3 in chloroform were prepared. Each sample was spiked with the R-enantiomer \nof phenylalaninol and the consequent fluorescence lifetime was measured. The concentration \nrange of phenylalaninol examined after an addition of 0 - 1000 \u00b5L of a 1.0-mol dm-3 stock \nsolution of R-phenylalaninol was 40 - 400-mmol dm-3. Solutions of L1 spiked with S-\nphenylalaninol were prepared in the same general manner as in the case of the R-enantiomer \nof PA. \n \nResults  \nExcitation and Emission Spectra \nThe design and synthesis of p-allyl calix[4]arene-tetra-S-propranolol amide L1 is reported \nelsewhere6. The excitation and emission spectra of L1 at a concentration of 0.7-\u00b5mol dm-3 in \nmethanol are shown in Figure 2, in the absence and presence of racemic phenylalaninol. The \nmaximum of the excitation spectrum is at 227 nm (Figure 2a), and the maximum of the \nemission spectrum obtained using an excitation wavelength of 227 nm is at 338 nm (Figure \n2b). Considering that phenylalaninol and methanol do not absorb in these regions, 227nm is a \nsuitable excitation wavelength for the following experiments in methanol. \nThe excitation and emission spectra of calix[4]arene L1 at a concentration of 3.0-\n\u00b5mol dm-3 in acetonitrile are shown in Figure 3, in the absence and presence of racemic \nphenylalaninol. There are maxima in the excitation spectrum at 220nm, 235nm and 285nm \n(Figure 3a), and the maximum of the emission spectrum obtained using an excitation \nwavelength of 285nm is at 339 nm (Figure 3b). The guest species PA and solvent do not \n 6 \nabsorb in the region of the spectrum higher than 280nm, hence 285nm was chosen as the \nexcitation wavelength for following experiments in acetonitrile. \nThe excitation and emission spectra of calix[4]arene L1 at a concentration of 5.0-\n\u00b5mol dm-3 in chloroform are shown in Figure 4, in the absence and presence of racemic \nphenylalaninol. The maxima of the excitation spectrum are at 285, 338 and 400 nm (Figure \n4a), and the maximum of the emission spectrum obtained using an excitation wavelength of \n285 nm is at 338 nm (Figure 4b). Given that the guest species PA and solvent do not absorb in \nthis region, 285nm was used as the excitation wavelength for following experiments in \nchloroform. \nLinear Response range \nIt is important to use a concentration of the calixarene within the linear range in order to \nensure that no self-quenching occurs and therefore that no alternative self-quenching \nmechanisms are present. The linear response range of fluorescence intensity of calixarene L1 \nin methanol was determined to be between 0.1 and 0.7-\u00b5mol dm-3. A concentration of 0.7-\n\u00b5mol dm-3 was chosen for L1 for subsequent experiments to examine the effects of \nphenylalaninol (PA), and hence any quenching observed can be related to the effect of the \ntarget species on the ligand.  \nThe linear response range of fluorescence intensity of calixarene L1 in acetonitrile \nwas determined to be between 0.1 and 4.0\u00b5mol dm-3 . A concentration of 3.0-\u00b5mol dm-3 was \nchosen for subsequent experiments in acetonitrile. The linear response range of fluorescence \nintensity of calixarene L1 in chloroform was determined to be between 0.1 and 6.0\u00b5mol dm-3 \nhence a concentration of 5.0-\u00b5mol dm-3 was chosen for L1 for following experiments in \nchloroform. \nVariation of Stern-Volmer plot with enantiomeric composition in methanol \nThe Stern-Volmer plot of L1 in methanol was found to be linear over the range 0-25 mmol \ndm-3 of racemic phenylalaninol (PA). Figure 5 illustrates the Stern-Volmer plots for the \nquenching of the fluorescence of calixarene L1 (0.7 \u00b5mol dm-3 in methanol), upon addition of \n0% S-PA: 100% R-PA, 50% S-PA: 50% R-PA (racemic mix) and 100% S-PA: 0% R-PA \nrespectively, at a concentration range of 0 \u2013 25mmol dm-3. The Stern-Volmer constant KSV, is \na measure of the quenching efficiency and a large value for this parameter indicates a \nsensitive response. The values for the Stern-Volmer constants (KSV) are 0.17, 0.12 and 0.09 \nafter the addition of 0 % S-PA: 100% R-PA, 50% S-PA: 50% R-PA and 100% S-PA: 0% R-\nPA respectively and the (KSV) ratio [100% R\/100% (S) is 1.9. Because the Stern-Volmer \n 7 \nplots show such a large difference in the KSV values of each enantiomer, it can be concluded \nthat in methanol, calix[4]arene L1 exhibits significant ability to discriminate between the \nenantiomers of phenylalaninol. \nPrevious results show that it is possible to discriminate between the enantiomers of \nchiral amines with appropriately arranged hydrogen bonding groups, chiral centres and \nquenching sites using suitably functionalised calix[4]arenes14, 15. The position of the chiral \ncentre relative to the hydrogen bonding groups and the aryl group in the guest molecule \nappears to be vitally important, illustrated by the fact that the calix[4]arene host L1 does not \ndiscriminate between enantiomers of phenylglycinol without an extra methylene spacer \nbetween the chiral centre and phenyl ring, while excellent discrimination is observed with \nphenylalaninol, with a methylene spacer6. The importance of the aryl group in the \ntransduction process (quenching) was convincingly demonstrated by preceding results using \ncyclohexylethylamine as guest13. L1 encompasses four appended chains with chiral units in \nthe S-configuration. For this reason it was envisaged that L1 would preferentially interact \nwith R-enantiomers of the guest species through hydrogen bonding and pi-pi overlap. \nFluorescence quenching studies confirm this proposed preferential association, with the R-\nenantiomer of phenylalaninol giving larger Stern-Volmer constants than the S-enantiomer. \nVariation of Stern-Volmer plot of a partially functionalised calix[4]arene with \nenantiomeric composition  \nAs a control to test the postulation that enantiomeric discrimination is due to the three-\ndimensional cavity of the lower calixarene rim, fluorescence-quenching studies were carried \nout on the p-allyl calix[4]arene- di-R-propranolol amide L2 (Figure 1) in the presence of both \nenantiomers of phenylalaninol in methanol. As can be seen from Figure 6 practically no \ndifference is discerned in the Stern-Volmer plots for L2 with each enantiomer, and in some \ncases the error bars for both series overlap. Consequently there is no difference in the KSV \nconstants for each enantiomer of phenylalaninol in the presence of L2 in methanol. This \ntherefore signifies that the partially substituted equivalent of the aforementioned calixarene \nL1 does not possess the ability to discriminate between the enantiomers of phenylalaninol. \nThis confirms the previous suggestion that discrimination is achieved due to an effect of the \n3-D distribution of pendent groups at the calixarene lower rim. \nVariation of Stern-Volmer plot with enantiomeric composition in acetonitrile \nThe Stern-Volmer plot of L1 in acetonitrile (3.0 \u00b5mol dm-3) was found not to be linear over \nthe range 0-40 mmol dm-3 of racemic phenylalaninol. Since the Stern-Volmer plots (not \n 8 \nshown) upon addition of 100% (R)- and 100% (S)-phenylalaninol respectively, show such \nsimilarities in the behaviour of each enantiomer at a concentration range of 0 \u2013 40mmol dm-3, \nit can be concluded that L1 does not exhibit significant ability to discriminate between the \nenantiomers of phenylalaninol in acetonitrile. \nFluorescence emission in Acetonitrile \nFigure 7 (a) shows the emission of L1 in acetonitrile after the addition of the phenylalaninol \nguest, which results in an initial large decrease in fluorescence intensity in the calixarene \nspectrum followed by only minor changes subsequent to further aliquots of guest addition. \nThis trend was observed for both enantiomers of phenylalaninol. This may be due to the \nformation of a 1:1 complex between the host and guest upon the addition of the guest to the \ncalixarene solution; however the exact mechanism of quenching is not clear at present. In \nview of the fact that similar effects were observed for both enantiomers of phenylalaninol, it \ncan be concluded that L1 does not possess the ability to discriminate between the enantiomers \nof phenylalaninol in acetonitrile.  \nVariation of Stern-Volmer plot with enantiomeric composition in chloroform \nThe Stern-Volmer plot of L1 in chloroform (5.0-\u00b5mol dm-3) was found to be linear over the \nrange 0 - 40-mmol dm-3 of racemic phenylalaninol. The Stern-Volmer plots upon the addition \nof 100% (R): 0% (S) and 100% (S): 0% (R)-phenylalaninol at a concentration range of 0 \u2013 40 \nmmol dm-3, yield KSV values of 0.014 and 0.011 for the R- and S-enantiomers of \nphenylalaninol respectively, i.e. a KSV ratio of 1.25. Although the slopes for each enantiomer \nin the presence of L1 are statistically different, these results taken at an emission wavelength \nof 338nm show great similarities in the behaviour of each enantiomer in the presence of L1, \nwhen compared to the methanol solutions previously discussed. Hence it can be concluded \nthat the ability of L1, to discriminate enantiomers of phenylalaninol at 338nm in chloroform, \nis greatly reduced compared to methanol.  \nFluorescence emission in Chloroform \nPreliminary studies of the absorption spectra of ligand L1 in chloroform show that the \naddition of guest phenylalaninol produces a simple additive effect to the calixarene absorption \nspectrum. However when the excitation spectrum of L1 is examined in the absence and \npresence of phenylalaninol (Figure 4a), differences are noted. When the emission spectrum of \ncalixarene L1 in chloroform is examined in the presence of R- and S-phenylalaninol \nvariations can clearly be seen (see Figure 7b and c). A decrease in fluorescence intensity is \nnoted at 338nm after addition of both enantiomers of PA, however in the presence of R-\n 9 \nphenylalaninol the weak emission band of L1 at 430nm is greatly enhanced. This \nenhancement is not observed however for L1 in the presence of S-phenylalaninol.   \nFigure 8 shows that by monitoring the fluorescence intensity of L1 in the presence of \neach enantiomer of phenylalaninol (at an emission wavelength of 430nm), a clear distinction \nbetween the effects of the R- and S-isomers of phenylalaninol can be observed, i.e. an \nincrease in fluorescence, which is in contrast to the results previously obtained. When \nmethanol is employed as solvent, the enantiomeric discrimination can be observed at 340nm \nas a decrease in the fluorescence intensity with a corresponding increase in guest \nconcentration. In the case of chloroform as solvent, if the fluorescence intensity is monitored \nat a wavelength of 430nm, the enantiomeric discrimination can be observed as an increase in \nthe fluorescence intensity with a corresponding increase in guest concentration. By \nmonitoring at this wavelength (430nm) it can clearly be discerned, which enantiomer is in \nsolution with calixarene L1. \nAn explanation for this increase in intensity of the emission band at 430nm is attributed \nto the presence of two emitting species in solution, which we have assigned as two different \nconformations of the calixarene L1. The 1H-NMR spectrum suggests that the calixarene does \nnot exist as a symmetrical cone in CDCl3 solution, but rather a distorted cone, which alters \nconfirmation to bind with metal ions in solution6. Energy minimised molecular modelling \nshows that the appended chains of this ligand can be flexible (see Figure 9)6.  The modelling \nstudies and 1H-NMR spectrum strengthen the argument that two conformations of the \ncalixarene are present in chloroform solution. In the case of L1, there is a relatively well-\ndefined 3-D chiral space through which the enantiomers must pass in order to facilitate \nquenching. Clearly, if this is the case, then the R-phenylalaninol must be better predisposed to \npassing through the chiral space than the S-enantiomer. Upon addition of R-phenylalaninol, \nthe conformation of L1 changes to accommodate and associate with the guest. This changes \nthe equilibrium of conformations present in solution, which seems to generate more of the \nconformer which emits at 430nm, and less of the form whose emission is observed at 340nm. \nThis would explain the intensity enhancement of the band at 430nm.  The fact that the band at \n340nm decreases in the presence of the S-enantiomer of phenylalaninol may be attributed to \nweak complex formation between S- phenylalaninol and L1. \nVariation of fluorescence lifetimes with enantiomeric composition  \nQuenching that results from diffusive encounters between the fluorophore and quencher \nduring the lifetime of the excited state is termed \u201cdynamic quenching\u201d. Quenching can also \noccur as a result of the formation of a non-fluorescent complex between the fluorophore and \nthe quencher i.e. \u201cstatic quenching\u201d. The fluorescence intensity decrease is linearly dependent \n 10 \non the concentration of the quencher, a case that is identical for both static and dynamic \nquenching. In general, mechanisms of quenching can be distinguished by their differing \ndependence on temperature and viscosity, or preferably by lifetime measurements.  \nEmploying an excitation wavelength of 307nm and scanning at an emission \nwavelength of 340nm, values of 9.4 and 4.6 ns were measured for the lifetime of L1 in \nmethanol, and 6.6 and 1.6 ns for the lifetime of L1 in chloroform, both in the absence and \npresence of R-PA (see Table 1). This would suggest that two fluorescing species are present \nin solution, and that addition of R-PA does not affect the lifetime of L1. Since spectroscopic \ngrade solvents were used the second value was not attributed to an impurity. The two \nlifetimes may be due to different conformations of the calixarene, as the array of naphthalene \ngroups can be differently positioned in one conformer over the other, possibly altering the \nelectronic state of the molecule. It is interesting to note that these and any following lifetime \nmeasurements were obtained in both oxygenated and degassed solutions, and that no \ndifference was discerned between values acquired. This implies that molecular oxygen has no \neffect on the fluorescence spectra of these solutions, failing to contribute to the quenching \nprocess.  \nThe lifetime of the excited state of L1 was also measured in the absence and presence \nof the S-enantiomer of phenylalaninol. Two values of 9.2 and 4.6 ns were measured in \nmethanol, and 6.6 and 1.6 ns in chloroform. The results illustrate that the presence of this \nguest enantiomer in solution does not perturb the excited state lifetime of the calixarene, \nconfirming that both enantiomers of phenylalaninol form ground state complexes with \ncalixarene L1 in methanol and chloroform, but clearly by different degrees as confirmed by \nthe emission quenching data. The fluorescence lifetime data confirms that the mechanism of \nquenching of the fluorescence of L1 by both enantiomers of phenylalaninol is static. Hence an \nexcited state complex is not accountable for the increase in intensity of the emission band at \n440nm. This reinforces the argument that there is a change in equilibrium of two calixarene \nconformations in the presence of R-phenylalaninol in chloroform solution.  \nAt present we cannot distinguish which conformation or rotamer is responsible for the \nemission bands at 340nm and 440nm. Fluorescence emission and lifetime measurements of \nmetal complexes of L1 in chloroform may help to discern whether a more rigid cone \nconformation induced by metal ion complexation is responsible for one of the emission bands. \nIt is clear however, that enantiomeric discrimination is possible with calixarene L1 in \nchloroform solution if the emission intensity is monitored at 440nm. Since the intensity of L1 \nin chloroform changes very little when in solution of S-PA (Figure 7b), and undergoes a four-\nfold increase when in the presence of R-PA (Figure 7c) (highest concentration) it is \nimmediately obvious which enantiomer one has in solution with this calixarene. It is clear that \n 11 \nthe enantiomeric composition of PA can be determined from the slope of the Stern-Volmer \nplots. However, a faster and less tedious method that involves only a single fluorescence \nmeasurement of the sample at 440nm in chloroform could be employed.  \nL1 has been designed to have hydrogen bonding sites and the chiral centre, separated \nfrom the naphthyl groups by an ether group. The guest molecule, PA (Figure 1), contains a \ngroup capable of hydrogen bonding (primary amine) as part of a chiral centre attached to an \naryl group via a methylene spacer. This arrangement could facilitate simultaneous pi-pi \ninteractions between the naphthyl groups on L1 and the PA aryl group and hydrogen bonding \nbetween the hydroxyl group on L1 and the PA amine. However, the presence of this \narrangement of structural features on its own does not explain the enantiomeric selectivity \ndisplayed by L1, as L2 does not exhibit this behaviour, with just two appended chains.  \nIn order to facilitate enantiomeric discrimination it is generally accepted that a \nnumber of points of attachment is desirable via hydrogen bonding17, 18. Molecular modelling \ncalculations suggest that up to four hydrogen bonds may occur between the (R)-enantiomer of \nphenylalaninol and the calixarene host L119. Energy minimised structures of the calix[4]arene \nL1 (see Figure 9) suggest that the four (S)-propranolol amide groups present a well-defined \n3D chiral space into which the (R)-enantiomer of phenylalaninol is preferentially bound, \nresulting in enhanced quenching compared to the (S)-enantiomer.  \nConclusion \nL1 was found to successfully discriminate between enantiomers of phenylalaninol in \nmethanol at 338nm. Fluorescence lifetime studies provide further information on the \nmechanism of quenching, and it was established that static quenching was the cause of the \ndecrease in fluorescence intensity at 338nm of L1 in the presence of PA. \nChiral discrimination of PA is not possible with L1 in acetonitrile. There appears to be \na 1:1 host: guest association between L1 and PA in this solvent. Since acetonitrile is a polar \nnon-protic solvent, there is no hydrogen bonding between the solvent and the calixarene. This \nimplies that the guest does not need to disrupt any host-solvent associations when spiked into \nthe calixarene solution and therefore immediately associates with the host. \nChiral discrimination is statistically possible with L1 and PA at 338nm in chloroform, \nbut is not comparable to that observed in methanol. When the emission intensity of L1 in \nchloroform is monitored at 440nm in the presence of PA, huge differences are seen with \nrespect to the two enantiomers. Practically no change in emission is observed at 440nm with \nthe S \u2013enantiomer, whereas a dramatic increase in fluorescence intensity is observed when the \nR- enantiomer is added. Fluorescence lifetime experiments have established a static \n 12 \nquenching mechanism between L1 and R-PA, thus ruling out exciplex formation, and show \ntwo fluorescing species in solution. These have been attributed to two different calixarene \nconformations in chloroform. When one consults energy minimised structures of L1 (see \nFigure 9) it is clear that the calixarene is quite flexible and may exist in conformations other \nthan a rigid cone in solution. This theory is supported by 1H-NMR spectra6. \n 13 \n \nO\nNO\n2\nO\nHO\nO 2\nO OH\n(117a)\nO\nNO\n4\nO\nOH\nOH\nNH2\nH\nL1 L2 PA\n \n \nFigure 1: Molecular structures of L1, L2 and PA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n200 250 300 350 400 450\nWavelength (nm)\nI 0 \n(ar\nbi\ntr\nar\ny \nu\nn\nits\n)\n(i)\n(ii)\nI 0 \n(ar\nbi\ntr\nar\ny \nu\nn\nits\n)\nCalixarene alone\nCalixarene + PA\nI 0 \n(ar\nbi\ntr\nar\ny \nu\nn\nits\n)\nI 0 \n(ar\nbi\ntr\nar\ny \nu\nn\nits\n)\n \n(a) \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n310 330 350 370 390 410 430 450\nWavelength (nm)\nIn\nte\nn\nsi\nty\n \n(ar\nbi\ntra\nry\n \nu\nn\nits\n)\n(i)\n(ii)\nIn\nte\nn\nsi\nty\n \n(ar\nbi\ntra\nry\n \nu\nn\nits\n)\nCalixarene alone\nCalixarene + PA\nIn\nte\nn\nsi\nty\n \n(ar\nbi\ntra\nry\n \nu\nn\nits\n)\nIn\nte\nn\nsi\nty\n \n(ar\nbi\ntra\nry\n \nu\nn\nits\n)\n \n(b) \nFigure 2: Excitation and emission spectra of calix[4]arene L1 at a concentration of 0.7-\u00b5mol \ndm-3 in methanol.
