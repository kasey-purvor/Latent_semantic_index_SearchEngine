Many of these women writers choose to\nfocus their writings on their experiences of life as South Asian women.\nIn this article, the diasporic literature I will be workingwith is by South\nAsian women writers from Canada, UK, and USA, and I therefore\nmay occasionally group these countries under the term, \u2018the West\u2019,\nfor ease of reference. For the same purpose, writers writing from\nwithin South Asia have been designated the term \u2018home writers\u2019.1 (It\nmust be noted that home and diasporic South Asian women writers\nare inclined to define themselves as such, based on race, culture, and\nfamily background, rather than on nationality and political status.)\nIt is perhaps unsurprising to find that the literature of diasporic\nwriters differs in style and content from theworks of thosewriting from\nwithin South Asia. Because there is a pattern of difference, this gives\nrise to the presumption that the geographical locations of the authors\ninfluence, to no small degree, their approach to writing in English, the\n1 One may well have reservations about the potentially misleading term \u2018home\nwriter\u2019; the term was chosen to imply that the writer resides within South Asia, or\nis a national of a South Asian country. It is not possible to ascertain the nationality\nof every diasporic writer, but the purpose of this differentiation between home and\ndiasporic writers is less to determine the political status of the authors, and more to\nregister the geographical residences and locations of the writers, which goes a long\nway in influencing the writing.\n0026\u2013749X\/05\/$7.50+$0.10\n237\n238 L ISA LAU\naudience for whom they write, and the concerns which they choose\nto draw attention towards. This difference and its implications is the\nprimary focus of this article, which argues that the diasporic writers\nenjoy an advantage in terms of their (global) profile, and this in turn\nhas had a significant impact on the representation of South Asia,\nespecially beyond the Indian sub-continent.\nThe next section of this article will discuss the prominence of\ndiasporic authors within this literary subculture of South Asian\nwomen\u2019s Literature, and the following section will proceed to discuss\nthe implications of this dominance on the literary scene. The fourth\nsection contains illustrations of the various types of diasporic andhome\ntexts, discussed with particular attention to the theme of identity in\nthese texts. The article concludes with a discussion of the similarities\nand differences in the contemporary home and diasporic writings of\nSouth Asian women, paying particular attention to the pattern of\ndifference, which is shaping and creating the image of South Asia.\nThe Prominence of Diasporic Authors Within the Genre\nTo understand the extent to which the literary subculture of South\nAsian women\u2019s writings is dominated by diasporic authors, it is useful\nto list the works of fiction (novels and short story collections) published\nin 2001 and 2002 (Table 1) and observe the proportion of diasporic\nauthors.2\nThe table includes information on the author\u2019s country of origin as\nwell as the current residence of the authors because it was found that\nmany of these authors have emigrated from South Asia to the West,\nespecially to USA. The vast majority of the authors in the table are\nin fact currently residing in the USA. Many, therefore, are diasporic\nAmerican Indians, and it is this group of writers who are the most\nprolific of the contemporary South Asian women writers, which in\nturn implies that it is their portrayals of South Asia and South Asian\nwomen which will be most widespread and dominant. It appears that\nit is predominantly the diasporic women writers who are the creators\nand keepers of the global literary image of South Asian culture, and\nthis trend looks set to continue.\n2 This list does not claim to be exhaustive, but it does compile the prose fiction I\nhave managed to access by South Asian women writers published in 2001 and 2002.\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 239\nTable 1\nPublications of South Asian Women\u2019s Writings in 2001\u20132002\nAuthor\u2019s Current Primary\ncountry location location\nAuthor Genre of origin of author of plot Publication details\nTalat Abbasi Short Pakistan USA Pakistan Oxford, UK, 2001\nstories\nBrinda Charry Novel India USA India Penguin, India, 2001\nChitra Short India USA USA Abacus, UK, 2001\nDivakaruni stories\nChitra Novel India USA USA Random, USA, 2001\nDivakaruni\nSuguna Iyer Novel India India India Penguin, India, 2001\nAmulya Malladi Novel India Denmark India Ballatine, USA, 2002\nRani Manicka Novel Malaysia UK Sri Lanka & Hodder &\nMalaysia Stoughton, 2002\nBharati Novel India USA India Hyperion, USA, 2002\nMukherjee\nAnita Nair Novel India India India Penguin, India, 2001\nMeera Nair Short India USA India Pantheon, USA, 2002\nstories\nKavery Novel India India India Penguin, India, 2002\nNambisan\nTahira Naqvi Short Pakistan USA USA TSAR, Canada, 2001\nstories\nKamila Novel Pakistan Pakistan Pakistan & Bloomsbury, 2002\nShamsie & UK USA\nPreeti Singh Novel India India India & Hodder & Stoughton,\nEgypt UK, 2002\nIndu Novel India USA India Pocket Books, USA,\nSunderesan 2002\nManjushree Novel Nepal USA Nepal Penguin, India, 2001\nThapa\nThrity Short India USA India Picador, USA, 2001\nUmrigar stories\nVineeta Novel India USA India Soho Press, USA,\nVijayaraghavan 2001\nOf these 18 publications in 2001 and 2002, there are 11 debut\nauthors represented here, which indicates that there are more and\nmore newcomers joining the literary scene.3 The momentum of\nSouth Asian women writing literature in English only seems to be\naccelerating, judging by the increasing numbers of first-time authors.4\n3 The debut authors on the table are: Abbasi, Charry, Iyer, Malladi, Manicka,\nM.Nair, Singh, Sunderesan, Thapa, Umrigar, Vijayaraghavan.\n4 In an online interview, the Publishing Director of Harper Collins had said that a\nsaturation point of South Asian women\u2019s literature will eventually assuredly come, but\n240 L ISA LAU\nCuriously, this list does not seem to contain any second-generation\ndiasporic South Asian writers. Most of the writers on this list were\nborn and raised in India. However, there are three Pakistani writers\u2014\nNaqvi comes from Lahore and Abbasi and Shamsie from Karachi,\nand all write about the Pakistani community. (Naqvi writes about the\ndiasporic Pakistani community in her latest publication.) For the first\ntime, there is even a Nepali writer publishing a novel in English\u2014\nThapa, from Kathmandu. Nevertheless, it is the writers from India\nwho still prevail in sheer numbers, and it is their writings which\ndominate the South Asian literary subculture.\nMeenakshi Mukherjee had expressed a fear that the increasing\nprominence of literature in English would cause a less than\nrepresentative view of India to emerge.\nThe category of writers called \u2018The Third World Cosmopolitans,\u2019 who are\nglobally visible, who are taught in postcolonial classrooms the world over,\nand who are hailed in the review pages of Western journals as interpreters\nand authentic voices of the non-Western world hardly ever include a writer\nfrom India who does not write in English . . . . . the precondition for belonging\nto this club is that s\/he must write originally in English. Implicit here is an\nerasure of the diversity of India (Mukherjee, 2000).\nJudging by the list of recent publications on this table, however, it\nwould appear that Mukherjee has more to fear than the erasure\nof India\u2019s diversity, or even the erasure of South Asia\u2019s diversity,\nbecause even the women writers from India writing in English are\neasily outnumbered by their diasporic American-Indian sisters.\nIt is a curious fact that although the majority of the authors on this\nlist are currently located in USA, their stories are mostly written\nagainst a backdrop of locations within South Asia. All the debut\nwriters have situated their writings within South Asia (at least in\npart), perhaps due to their familiarity with both the culture and the\ngeographical location of their countries (and cities) of origin. It is\npossible that having settled outside South Asia, they may choose\nto write of South Asia in order to inform other non-South Asians\nabout their culture. It is remarkable, however, that all eleven debut\nwriters have independently decided to start by writing of life for\npeople in South Asia even though most of them are now living in\nUSA. (Vijayaraghavan is a slight exception in that although her\nat this juncture in time (2001), it appears that the saturation point is still nowhere\nin sight.\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 241\nnovel is situated in India, she writes of a diasporic protagonist on a\nsummer visit.) There is usually a wealth of local detail in these books,\nsuggesting that these authors are drawing on personal experiences\nand memories.\nIt is also worth noting that although all the debut novels and short\nstories on the list have located their plots and characters in South\nAsia, Divakaruni, and Naqvi did not choose to do so in their writings.\nIt is must be remembered that these are not debut writers. Continuing\ntheir literary careers, these authors have chosen to turn from writing\nof South Asians in South Asia, to writing of the diasporic experience\nfor South Asians in USA. It remains to be seen whether these debut\nnovelists will also be turning to situate South Asian characters in the\nWest instead of in South Asia.\nPositioning Home and Diasporic Writers\nWhether moving from South Asia to the West, or vice versa, or having\nbeen born and bred in the West, the one clear message from diasporic\nSouth Asian women writers is that they are different, very different,\nfrom their Western and South Asian counterparts. They are people\nwho are asmulti-cultural as they aremulti-lingual. They do not regard\nthemselves as fully belonging in either culture, and have practically\nevolved a sub-culture peculiar to themselves. They try to take the\nbest from both worlds, but suffer the sense of hybridity and cultural\nentanglement. \u2018Transplanted, the individual is transformed; the \u201cI\u201d is\nno longer a speaking subject with a clear history and a distinct voice\nbut rather becomes a composite product of historical antimonies and\ncontradictory impulses\u2019 (Balkan, 1998).\nApart from the cultural entanglement (which can also be regarded\nas hybridity), diasporic South Asian writers have in common the deep\ndesire to \u2018look back\u2019 to South Asia, to write and discuss at length the\nconfusion of identity they are experiencing. This process of \u2018looking\nback\u2019 which has been described as nostalgia, seems irresistible to\ndiasporic writers. Salman Rushdie explains that for Indians,\n. . . . . exiles or emigrants or expatriates, are haunted by some sense of loss,\nsome urge to reclaim, to look back, even at the risk of being mutated into\npillars of salt. But if we do look back, we must also do so in the knowledge\u2014\nwhich gives rise to profound uncertainties\u2014that our physical alienation from\nIndia almost inevitably means that we will not be capable of reclaiming\nprecisely the thing that was lost; that we will, in short, create fictions, not\n242 L ISA LAU\nactual cities or villages, but invisible ones, imaginary homelands, Indias of\nthe mind (Rushdie, 1983).\nRushdie highlights a vital point\u2014namely that some of the Indias\ncreated by the diasporic communities may be no more than imaginary\nIndias. Be that as it may, the images of South Asia propounded\nand disseminated by the diasporic writers have the power of\ncreating\/recreating a South Asia to the wider world, (especially to\na Western world, given the readership), and through the countless\nretellings, the \u2018true\u2019 portrayal of India may be warped, skewed, and\ndistorted. Rushdie further explains that this skewed perspective may\nnot be due to authorial irresponsibility, but is in fact the inevitable\nconsequence of diasporic life because \u2018it may be that when the Indian\nwriter who writes from outside India tries to reflect that world, he is\nobliged to deal in broken mirrors, some of whose fragments have been\nirretrievably lost\u2019 (Rushdie, 1983).\nAlthough the diasporic writers may reflect their identities through\nfragments of broken mirrors as Rushdie puts it, these reflections are\nimbibed by others in the diasporic community, namely, the readers.\nSome readers do of course challenge the accuracy and completeness\nof the portrayal of South Asia, but for many, the literary images\nadvancing and propagating (and even prescribing) a certain way\nof life which is then labelled as \u2018diasporic South Asian\u2019 results in\nthe diasporic community trying to reproduce what they have read.\nWriters are therefore at least partially responsible for contributing\nto the creation of a diasporic culture. In brief, the imagined and\nfictionalised diasporic experience may have become more real than\nreality.\nIt must also be noted that outside the Indian subcontinent, it is\ngenerally easier to obtain the publications of diasporic South Asian\nwomen writers than to obtain the work of home writers. This may in\npart be due to the audience and the demand for specific literature.\nDiasporic South Asians, especially those living in countries where they\nhave facilities for publication and publicity available to them, are\nbetter positioned to formulate the image of South Asia. It is ironic that\nthese articulate diasporic South Asian women writers may be so much\nmore effective than their South Asian counterparts in marketing their\nideas and ideals, that they almost consign the homeSouthAsians to the\nposition of subalternism. Diasporic literature is not only a reflection of\ndiasporic life; it also plays a part in the propagating of certain ideas and\nideals which contribute to the shaping of the identity of the diasporic\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 243\ncommunity. In short, diasporic literature produces a culture which it\nthen circulates and legitimises (Said). This diasporic culture is initially\nan imagined culture, but having grafted itself into the imagination\nof the diasporic community, it becomes part of the thriving\nculture.\nIn terms of sheer numbers, as has been observed in Table 1 above,\ntheir prominence on the literary scene is considerable. Moreover,\nwith their greater access to publication, promotion, and wide-spread\ndistribution channels, the diasporic South Asian women writers find\nthemselves in a position of disproportionate influence and reach, and\ntheir portrayals of South Asian women regarded as representative.\nAlthough the portrayals by these diasporic writers are regarded as\nrepresentative, these images makers occasionally appear to be slightly\nunsure of the culture they are portraying. It is quite ironic to then\nfind these diasporic authors requesting that their work be checked\nby other South Asian women to ensure that the details and local\ncolour in their writings (particularly for ceremonies and festivals) are\nauthentic and accurate. The positionality of diasporic South Asian\nwomen writers can therefore be understood to be a somewhat uneasy\none as they simultaneously struggle to negotiate their identities and\nyet find themselves occupying a vantage point relative to those writing\nfrom within South Asia.\nThis position, however, may not necessarily be an enviable one;\nas Spivak pointed out, by making an individual a representative of\ntheir race\/religion\/nation, it was actually distancing that individual\nfrom the group represented by differentiating the individual from the\ngroup. In addition, it has been pointed out that there are numerous\npitfalls for writers who set themselves up, or are set up by others, as\n\u2018emissaries\u2019, \u2018mirrors\u2019 or \u2018the authentic insiders\u2019 (Narayan,1998).One\nmajor pitfall is that diasporic communities are inclined to succumb to\n\u2018totalisations\u2019 (defined by Uma Narayan as casting values or practices\nwhich pertain only to specific privileged groups within the community\nas values of the \u2018culture\u2019 as awhole). Totalisations are one of the results\nof deterritorialisation, the displacement of identities and meanings\n(Kaplan, 1987); diasporic writers more vulnerable to this than the\nhome writers. In the following discussion of the literature by diasporic\nSouth Asian women writers, it can be seen that nostalgia, totalisation,\nand deterritorialisation are all factors which play their parts in\nshaping the imagination and identity of the diasporic community,\nand consequently, their presentation of the image of South Asia to the\nworld.\n244 L ISA LAU\nJustapositioning Texts\nIt must be acknowledged that upon close analysis of the literary\nand personal backgrounds of the authors (such as are available to\nbe studied), a definition of what precisely constitutes a diasporic\nwriter is neither easy nor exhaustive. Many South Asians now travel\nwidely, frequently, and for extended periods of time. Many reside\nboth in South Asia and in the West, having family and bases in\nboth locations and thus moving freely and frequently from one to\nthe other. Some have immigrated, some hold dual-citizenship, while\nothers have permanent residence status in countries outside their\nown. The distinction between travel (however frequent) and diaspora\nneeds to be made, and it is worded most succinctly by Clifford who\nsays, \u2018diaspora is different from travel (although it works through\ntravel practices) in that it is not temporary\u2019 (Clifford, 1997).\nThis travel and mobility, which was scarcely possible only several\ndecades ago and far more uncommon, now slightly blurs the boundary\nbetween the home and diasporic writers. This suggests that these very\nboundary markers are negotiable, and certainly questionable, and it\nis important to keep in mind that the distinctions are not set in stone.\nNevertheless, for the purposes of comparison, and in order to trace\nthe emerging pattern in the writings of the South Asian women, in\nthis article diasporic writers are so defined if they either do not write\nfrom within South Asia or else are not primarily based in South Asia.\n(This is a working definition rather than an attempt to classify writers\ninto watertight compartments.)\nThe geographical location of the women characters in the novels\nof diasporic South Asian women writers largely fall into three broad\ncategories: South Asian women who were born and bred in a Western\ncountry and have subsequently either been sent back to South Asia\nfor a prolonged stay or to be married, or have simply chosen to\n\u2018return\u2019; SouthAsianwomenwhowere born and bred in SouthAsia and\nsubsequently have either been sent or have chosen to live in the West;\nand South Asian women who were born and bred in aWestern country\nand continue to live there. Notions of identity differ significantly\nin each of these categories as formal textual interpretation in the\nfollowing section will illustrate. The textual interpretation will also\ninclude an example of a home author, for the purposes of comparison.\n(The texts selected for the following analysis have been chosen for\ntheir deliberate engagement with issues not only of being a woman,\nbut of being a South Asian woman, wherever she may find herself.)\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 245\nFrom West to East\nVijayaraghavan\u2019s Motherland tells the tale of teenage protagonist,\nMaya, sent by her parents from USA to Tamil Nadu, to spend a\nsummer with her mother\u2019s relatives. This trip is intended to remind\nMaya of her roots and culture, and is an attempt to dissipate some\nof the undesirable influences of Westernisation. As Maya renews her\nacquaintance with the way of life in India, and accustoms herself\nonce again to living under a different set of rules, standards and\nexpectations, she discovers new aspects of herself. Dinner parties,\nvisits to friends of relatives, dealingwith servants, all these daily events\nbring home to Maya the confusing and disturbing knowledge that in\nsome way, she is different from her relatives.\nMaya is confused because, to a greater extent than she recognises, at\nunexpected moments, she finds herself tempted to identify herself as\nAmerican. In conversation with her uncle and aunt, Maya suddenly\ndiscovers her latent loyalties and affinities, \u2018\u201cWhy would America\nwant to do that?\u201d I asked. I was careful not to say \u201cwe\u201d for America\u2019\n(Vijayaraghavan, 2001). It appears that amongst her Indian relatives\nin Tamil Nadu, Maya feels American, whereas amongst her white\nAmerican friends, Maya feels Indian.Wherever she is, Maya compares\nherself with others and finds herself balancing between two sets of\nexperiences which seem worlds apart from each other, and yet are\nboth contained within her. In containing these separate worlds within\nher, Maya feels she is not completely a hundred percent from or of\neither.\nMaya discovers that with each trip to India, she finds herself\nstruggling harder not to feel out of place, \u2018If I scrubbed hard enough, I\nhoped I would peel away that layer of Americaness that made me feel\nclumsy and conspicuous here; I wanted to unearth that other person\nwho had felt at home here and known how to fit in\u2019 (Vijayaraghavan,\n2001). Maya\u2019s problem can in part be attributed to the fact that\nshe is unaccustomed to the less comfortable living conditions, but\nthe problem is also augmented by the fact that her relatives notice\nher \u2018clumsiness\u2019, remark on it, joke, or otherwise draw attention to\nher being from USA, however inoffensively. Her relatives regard her\nforeign statuswith amixture of pride and deprecation, proud to be able\nto claim a niece and therefore connections in USA, and deprecating\nbecause they fear she may no longer be one of them.\n\u2018Nowmore than on earlier trips, I felt how hard and how exhausting\nit was to translate, even though we were all speaking English. There\n246 L ISA LAU\nwere so many ways of being and expressing myself that I had to leave\nbehind, somany I had to relearn\u2019 (Vijayaraghavan,2001).Mayamakes\nan interesting point when she says she has to translate even though all\nare speaking in English. The English spoken in India and in America\nare naturally different and the teenage Maya feels obliged to change\nher manner of self-expression, which in turn necessitates some shift\nof self-identity also.\nThe older Maya grows, the more it is brought home to her that\nshe has to come to terms with the dual identities she has inherited,\nand that both worlds are increasingly demanding of her loyalties.\nShe finds herself walking a finer and finer line as fewer and fewer\nallowances are made for her youth. Part of Maya\u2019s problem is the\napproach and attitude taken by her relatives in India. She finds herself\npresented with only two options, \u2018\u201cLook Maya,\u201d said my aunt, with an\nedge of exasperation. \u201cIt is up to you. You can come here and be\na tourist, do whatever you like to do, or you can come here and be\na member of the family, with responsibilities and obligations. You\nchoose\u201d\u2019 (Vijayaraghavan, 2001). Her aunt\u2019s words convey to Maya\nthe implicit warning that she must conform if she wishes to retain\nthe privilege of her place in the family, leaving Maya little room to be\nboth Indian and American simultaneously, leaving Maya little room\nto be the Indian-American which she is. Little occasional remarks or\nreminders such as, \u2018\u201cYou\u2019ve been Indian longer than you have been\nanything else,\u201d my aunt said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that\u201d\u2019 (Vijayaraghavan,\n2001) are designed to instill in Maya a sense of owed loyalty and duty.\nDiasporic South Asians in Maya\u2019s position often feel the conflicting\ntug of loyalties, and to different degrees, seek a sense of belonging\nwhen in South Asia. According to Vijay Prashad, it is not only issues of\nidentity which the diasporic South Asians have to grapple with, they\nalso have to deal with both the notions and the reality of a distant\nhomeland, \u2018Those in India too struggle with the reconstruction of\nculture. The only advantage they have over the desi5 diaspora is that\nthey do not have to labour under the illusion that there is a distant\nland that is home of pure religion, of the dharma thatHindu American\nchildren are told to long for\u2019 (Prashad, 2000).\nWhen in South Asia, many diasporic South Asians find that they are\npart of a large joint or extended family, a very different experience and\nposition from interacting only with a nuclear family. All the diasporic\n5 Desi: defined as those who claim South Asian ancestry.\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 247\nSouth Asian women writers, without exception, compare either\nimplicitly or explicitly, the closeness of family ties within and without\nSouth Asia. Most portray family ties in South Asia as being stronger\nand closer than inWestern countries, where they aremore likely to feel\ntheir individualism to a greater extent, and more alone. Some write\nof this aloneness with relief and pleasure, portraying it as a welcome\nhaven away from the suffocation of family pressure and interference,\nwhile others describe it as loneliness, alienation and exile. This\ncomparison is carried out both by diasporic authors describing moves\nfrom theWest to the Indian subcontinent, and vice versa. This leads us\ninto a consideration of the second category of diasporic South Asians:\nthose who have been born and bred in South Asia, and who have\nimmigrated to Western countries in their adult lives.\nFrom East to West\nIn most of the diasporic South Asian women\u2019s writings, the journey\nfrom West to East is a brief one, a trip made during vacation time\nor in times of family emergencies, a time away from work and the\nusual routine of everyday life. More often than not, it is a trip which\ninvolves meeting relatives and old friends, very frequently, staying\nwith the nuclear and\/or extended family. It is usually a brief sojourn\nfrom the familiar to the forgotten or distant familiar. Journeying from\nEast to West, however, is portrayed by the South Asian women writers\nas being a very different cup of tea altogether. It is a move from the\nknown to the unknown. It is usually for a considerable amount of time,\nto be calculated in terms of years rather than weeks or months. It may\nbe a traumatic journey due to the certain knowledge that those left\nbehind in South Asia have invested much and are eagerly awaiting\nnews of success. It is a journey away from close networks of family and\nfriends, to the loneliness of being a stranger in a strange land. Return\nto South Asia is usually assumed, but at an indefinite point in the\nfuture.\nBaldwin\u2019s stories of Sikh communities in Canada discuss how\nimmigrants cope with their new environments. Baldwin\u2019s stories\ndemonstrate that each character experiences the same sense of\ndislocation and displacement, but for different reasons, to different\nextents, and consequently evolve different methods of coping.\n\u2018Montreal 1962\u2019 is Baldwin\u2019s tale of a young housewife who has\nimmigrated to Canada with her husband. She is deep in thought\n248 L ISA LAU\nabout being away from her community as she lovingly handles the\nturbans which she is washing. Being nostalgic for home, she reflects\nonly on the way her distant homeland compares far more favourably\nthan Montreal, where she finds herself. This short story hints at\nthe problems of preserving one\u2019s culture in a place which does not\ncomprehend such a culture, let alone sympathise with it. For this\nprotagonist, the turban becomes the symbol not only of the Sikh\nidentity, but of her pride in this identity. Although aware that her\nhusband has been disadvantaged in seeking employment because he\nwears a turban, she nevertheless resolves, \u2018And so, my love, I will not\nlet you cut your strong rope of hair and go without a turban in this land\nof strangers . . . . . Then we will have taught Canadians what it takes\nto wear a turban\u2019 (Baldwin, 1996). This indicates that the diasporic\nSouth Asian may be very conscious of being a representative of his\/her\nrace\/religion\/culture\/country of origin. Baldwin\u2019s words suggest that\nthere is a need on the part of the diasporic South Asians to prove\nsomething to Westerners, a fear or a refusal or a precaution against\nbeing despised, pitied, or patronised. The turban may no longer be\nworn only because it is part of one\u2019s culture, but may in part be worn\nbecause in the public eye, one\u2019s cultural identity has to be constantly\ndemonstrated and reinforced.\nWhether attempting to stand apart or to integrate, it appears that\ndiasporic South Asians are self-consciously representatives of their\nrace and culture, aware of being cast in such a role, and accepting\nit, occasionally even welcoming and exploiting it. One frustrating\noutcome of such a role is that \u2018as emissaries, third world individuals\nare often expected to be virtual encyclopaedias of information on all\nsorts of different aspects of their complex \u201ccultural\u201d heritage. Their\nencyclopaedic expertise is often expected to range from the esoteric to\nthe mundane, from popular to High Culture, from matters of history\nto contemporary issues\u2019 (Narayan, 1998). Even diasporic South Asian\nwomen writers are not exempt from such pressures and expectations\nand find themselves needing to verify their cultural facts before pub-\nlishing. This concern with accuracy of cultural facts suggests a lack of\nconfidence in their own knowledge of the culture, and a possible differ-\nence in the way they themselves practise their culture on a daily basis.\nThe sense of being an \u2018emissary\u2019, in Narayan\u2019s terminology, is sim-\nultaneously annoying and gratifying. It does serve to set the diasporic\nSouth Asian apart, perpetually labelled as \u2018the Other\u2019 in a Western\nenvironment, but if the difference is regarded as privileged, exclusive,\nor desirable, it may well be welcomed. It appears that being \u2018the\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 249\nOther\u2019 is acceptable and even pleasant, as long as thewider community\nregards their difference as an asset rather than a liability or a lacking.\nEast in West\nThis subsection focuses on South Asians who have never known a home\nwithin South Asia, i.e. the second-generation diasporic South Asians.\nOne author who falls into this category is British-Punjabi Meera Syal.\nSyal\u2019s first novel features a protagonist called Meena, for whom home\nis Tollington, England.\nAnita and Me depicts Meena growing up and learning early to juggle\ntwo identities\u2014one for home and family life, and one for public life\namongst her English peers. Meena clearly enjoys her cosy family\nlife, but she also strives to be regarded as a \u2018Tollington wench\u2019. She\nenjoys the company of her parents\u2019 friends\u2014the diasporic South Asian\ncommunity in Britain, the \u2018aunties\u2019 and \u2018uncles\u2019\u2014but she also hankers\nafter the company of Anita Rutter, a brazen, hard-boiled English girl.\nAlthough deeply attached to her parents, Meena learns from\nchildhood that she has two sets of morals to juggle and contend with,\none applicable at home, and the other applicable outside her home. For\nexample, Meena is well aware that stealing would horrify her parents,\nand yet she does steal, because it affords her a pleasing sense of\nbravado, and it is the passport to acceptance amongst her peers.Meena\nis impressed by her parents and the way they live their culture, but it\nis their culture, rather than hers. She is aware that the standards and\npractises of her parents\u2019 culture would earn her little by way of street\ncredit, and accordingly, she learns to deal in a differentmoral currency,\njust as she learns to speak with a different accent and slang when\noutside her house. Although just a child, Meera perceives that life\ninside the home and life outside it are divided into two separate worlds.\nSyal shows that even a child as young as Meena (nine years of age),\nalthough identifying with her parents\u2019 culture to some extent, already\nunderstands that she is different. She notes that although her parents\nare respected and approved of by the general community they live\namongst, they do not completely respect or approve of their neigh-\nbours. They choose not to belong and set themselves apart from the\nEnglish community. Meena, in comparison, is comfortable thinking\nof herself not only as English, but as belonging to Tollington, \u2018 . . . . . I\nhad won them over with my cheeky charm . . . . . and my deliberately\nexaggerated Tollington accent, thus proving I was very much one of\n250 L ISA LAU\nthem, they did not need to shout to make themselves understood or\nthink they could get away with muttered swearing and I would not un-\nderstand, that I belonged\u2019 (Syal, 1997). She enjoys her easy inclusion\nin the Tollington community and it is not until she is a little older that\nshe would realise the underlying racial tensions and realise too, that\nshe does not, in fact, belong. This, in a curious inversion, is the same\nexperience as that of Maya in Motherland who also finds that in visits\nto India, as she grows older, increasingly she is being forced to choose\nher set of affiliations. This indicates that for diasporic South Asians,\nwherever they go, whether in South Asia or in their new homes in the\nWest, they continue to experience the sense of double-consciousness.\nHome South Asian Women Writers\nHome South Asian writers also portray protagonists being concerned\nover the issue of self-identity, but this struggle is not with the\nmaintaining of a South Asian identity in a Western world, but in\nfinding individuality in a community which is highly prescriptive of\neach person\u2019s role. Kavery Nambisan is an author who tells the tale of\na young Indian woman who travels to resolve her own identity. Shari,\nthe protagonist of Nambisan\u2019s novel Mango Coloured Fish is a young\nwoman who travels to understand what she has to escape from. When\nShari feels her social personality is being created at the expense of\nher private personality, she makes up her mind to put some distance\nbetween herself and her home.\nShari\u2019s is only a partial identity crisis because she has already figured\nout what she does not want to be: she does not want to be the woman\nher mother is attempting to mould her into. Shari\u2019s family is run\nby her dominating mother, who exercises control with a mixture\nof unscrupulous charm and uncompromising determination. Shari\u2019s\nolder sister, having the same goals and ambitions as her mother, had\nbeen the \u2018perfect daughter\u2019. Shari\u2019s older brother had not been a\nperfect son, and as a result, had been the black sheep of the family\nand chose to live far away in Vrindaban, happy in his choice of a wife\nand in his work as a low profile doctor. It is to this brother that Shari\nescapes, with her marriage fast approaching.\nNambisan highlights the North\u2013South divide of India in Shari\u2019s\nfamily. Although they are Tamils fromMadras (Chennai), her mother\nhad decided that Delhi culture is more refined, and has tried to\nerase their Tamilian origins. Her husband had meekly complied with\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 251\nher wishes, which ranged from choice of attire and food to personal\ninterests, \u2018Father gave up the dhotis he wore at the house for kurta-\npyjamas, and rubber chappals for kolhapuris; ate rotis instead of rice,\ndrank tea instead of coffee, and listened to Begum Akhtar and Bade\nGhulam Ali instead of Mali or Chembai\u2019 (Nambisan, 1998). Shari\u2019s\nmother seems equally determined to shape Shari\u2019s identity as she has\ndone with her husband\u2019s.\nFleeing her family (especially her mother), and fleeing marriage\nwith Gautam, (a man whom she herself had chosen), Shari flies to\nVrindaban, and then on to Delhi to stay with her old school friend,\nYash. Shari flees her family because she wishes to escape the type\nof lifestyle her marriage to Gautam would inevitably comprise. On\nthe verge of assuming the new identity as Gautam\u2019s wife which her\nmother fervently wishes for her, Shari also flees because she loves\nan unsuitable man, one who does not wish to marry her, but one who\nunderstands her and does not seek to change her. InDelhi, Sharimoves\nout of Yash\u2019s house, and finds a room for herself in a hostel, for several\nweeks. Although such accommodation lacks the comforts she has been\naccustomed to, it does afford her the time and space to do as she, and\nshe alone, wishes. Shari realises that accepting Yash\u2019s hospitality, just\nas accepting her family\u2019s support and later Gautam\u2019s support, would\nrequire a conforming of her personality to their wishes, to some extent.\nA large part of Shari\u2019s identity crisis lies in the fact that her society\u2019s\nstructure does not leave hermuch opportunity to define herself. Living\nwith Yash, she realises that Yash has allowed her society\u2019s wishes and\nvalues to formher life, and that Yash is unhappy and dissatisfied in and\nwith her identity. Nambisan portrays the bait of social sanction and\nfinancial security trapping South Asian women like Yash. Nambisan\nalso portrays that it is so subtle and insidious a trap that although\nShari instinctively struggles when she feels it closing around her, she\nis not entirely sure what it is, precisely, that she is struggling against.\nThis makes it more difficult not only to resolve an identity crisis, but\nto recognise one as such in the first place. Nambisan\u2019s novel hints that\nsome societies are so highly structured that there is little room for\nexploration of self-identity.\nDifferences and Similarities\nWherever contemporary South Asian women writers may be writing\nfrom, it is clear from the outset that many grapple with issues\n252 L ISA LAU\nof identity. Identity is one of the most common themes in their\nliterature, and in many cases the search for self-identity is portrayed\nas confusing, painful and only occasionally rewarding. Some write\nsemi-autobiographical novels, delving into personal pasts in order to\neither discover or re-examine their motivations and affinities. Others\nuse fictional characters and situations to question traditional norms,\ntesting, trying, and occasionally reinforcing (whether intentionally or\notherwise) notions of race and culture. Many contemporary South\nAsian women writers write with a sense of attempting to make their\nindividual voices heard over a cacophony of long-standing stereotypes\nand expectations.\nThe writings of the diasporic South Asian women writers clearly\ndemonstrate that their notions of identity are intimately boundupwith\nconcepts of home and place, as the space of return and of consolidation\nof the Self, enabled by the encounter not with the other, but with one\u2019s\nown (Grewal, 1996). The writings also suggest that the notions of\nself and identity, as conceived of by the women characters, change\nover time, and significantly, change depending on their location\nand environment. Diasporic South Asian women writers, almost\nwithout exception, testify to a sense of dual or multiple identities.\n\u2018The South Asian diaspora looks to the sub-continent as an anchor\nfor identity formation, however mythical and uncomfortable . . . . . \u2019\n(Bhattacharyya, 1998). Many also hint at a \u2018double consciousness\u2019,\nas it was termed by W. E. B. Dubois. Many go on to perceive the East\nand West as being in cultural conflict and\/or opposition, and set up\ntheir stories accordingly, always emphasising the sense of being torn\nin two directions.\nIt is noteworthy that although the vast majority of novels and\nshort story collections written by diasporic South Asian women\nare concerned with the roles, positions, experiences, situations and\ncircumstances of the women, writings by home South Asian women\nwriters are far more diverse in theme and concern.\nBroadly speaking, issues of identity for diasporic South Asian women\nare bound up with ideas of home, roots, and belonging, whereas\nissues of identity for home South Asian women are inclined to be\nconcerned over individualism and realising self-potentials. \u2018In general\nthe migratory experience can lead to more embracing identifications\non themargin of the host society. Thosewho do not think of themselves\nas Indians before migration become Indians in the diaspora\u2019 (Van der\nVeer, 1995). It appears that these notions and debates, and the very\nself-consciousness of what it means to be South Asian, is primarily\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 253\ncontested and shaped by the diasporic community, to a much greater\nextent than by the South Asians within South Asia.\nClifford points out that diasporic women are \u2018caught between\npatriarchies, ambiguous pasts, and futures. They connect and\ndisconnect, forget and remember, in complex, strategic ways. The\nlived experiences of diasporic women thus involve painful difficulty in\nmediating discrepant worlds\u2019 (Clifford, 1997). These diasporic South\nAsian women are also inclined to form their identities in reaction to\nthe culture they have brought from South Asia, either in conformity\nwith it or in rebellion against it.\nFrom the contemporary writings of the diasporic South Asian\nwomen, it appears that South Asian women of the diaspora feel\nthe tug of loyalties and confusion of identities until they learn to\nbalance dual-identities or double consciousness, and combine those\ninto a certain equilibrium. Many diasporic South Asians appear to\nlabour under the assumption that there has to be a trade-off between\nbeing \u2018authentically South Asian\u2019, and being \u2018Westernised\u2019. There is a\nhabitual attempt to set up a situation where the \u2018traditional\u2019 is pitted\nagainst the \u2018modern\u2019. In a search for cultural purity, too many fall\ninto the unrealistic assumption that tradition is at polar opposites\nfrom modernity, seeking to designate one as desirable and the other\nas undesirable. In the temptation to oversimplify or dichotomise,\ndiasporic South Asians engage in a process of \u2018selective rejection\nof Westernization\u2019 (Narayan, 1998). This selectiveness is in turn a\nreaction to or an influence of post colonialism. Inmuch of the literature\nof the diasporic South Asian women writers, the protagonists are\nportrayed learning to negotiate a hybrid identity, forging a new self\nwhich manages to co-exist more comfortably both in a South Asian\nenvironment and in a Western one. In discussing the tensions which\ndominate \u2018colonised lives\u2019, Aligiah describes these tensions as \u2018the\nattempt to build a bridge from one culture to another without falling\ninto the ravine in the middle in the process\u2019 (Aligiah, 2001). This\nhybrid identity is therefore presented as something of a balancing\nact.\nThe strong polarisation of East and West, with comparisons drawn\nand juxtapositions made between these two supposedly socially\nopposing or even conflicting cultures, is all too common in the\nliterature of diasporic South Asian women writers. It is only a tiny\nhandful of writers such as AnitaDesai whose works do the opposite and\nexplore the similarities between East and West rather than set them\nup as irreconcilably different. The majority of diasporic South Asian\n254 L ISA LAU\nwomen writers portray their protagonists fighting the dual battle for\nethnic\/racial rights and recognition, and the battle against patriarchy\nand traditional cultural restrictions and taboos. These battles are\nmade even more complicated by the fact that the protagonists are\nusually seeking acceptance bothwithin the inner circle of their families\nand in the outer, racially and culturally different world.\nIn comparison, the writings of the home South Asian women authors\ndo pursue the notion of identity, but not through a comparison of what\nlies within South Asia with what lies without. Home South Asian\nwomen writers are inclined to analyse the way their protagonists\ntry to develop themselves in ways which are different from those\ntraditionally prescribed by society. Women are portrayed attempting\nto rise above gender stereotypes and powerful social expectations of\nthem as women, wives and mothers, and striving to gain some degree\nof autonomy and individuality. Their struggle is primarily against the\npatriarchal nature and habit of their society rather than a sense of\ndouble consciousness. Like the diasporic South Asian women, they are\nalso regarded as keepers of their culture, and burdened with the role\nof being guardians of the sanctity of their traditions, but unlike the\ndiasporic community, they need not fear distance from the homeland\ncausing the loss or dilution of their culture.\nAnother commonality in terms of notions of identity in the literature\nof diasporic and home South Asian women\u2019s is that both sets of writers\nhighlight the cultural practice of holding up ideals of the good South\nAsian women to be emulated. In this sense, wherever they may live,\nSouth Asian women find that their identities as such are predefined,\nby cultures which base their identities on the womenfolk.\nConclusion\nIn the comparison of diasporic and home writings by South Asian\nwomen, the primary difference observed is how identity is perceived\nand engaged with. For South Asian women of the diaspora, nostalgia,\nfamilial expectations, and the notion of the distant and perfect\nhomeland continue to dog their notions of identity and belonging,\n\u2018 . . .women in diaspora remain attached to, and empowered by, a\n\u201chome\u201d culture and a tradition\u2014selectively\u2019 (Clifford, 1997). The\nword \u2018selectively\u2019 is significant\u2014diasporic South Asian women do\nindeed practise only certain elements of their culture and tradition,\nand certainly not the culture in entirety. While some diasporic South\nMAKING THE DIFFERENCE 255\nAsians attempt to emulate mainstream society and integrate, there\nare others who deliberately flaunt their difference, marketing it as\nexotic, mysterious, exciting, or in whichever form would enable them\nto best use it as a means to their ends. These diasporic South\nAsians brandish their skin colours, accents, clothes, and all other\nsymbols of their difference, either as weapons or as trophies, or\nboth.\nThe selectivity of the culture which diasporic South Asians live and\npractise, results in diasporic South Asian culture becoming a partially\nreinvented culture. Perhaps it is as a result of this, that there exists\na constant anxiety over the authenticity of the culture they claim as\ntheir South Asian heritage. (It is an irony that both the non-South\nAsian world as well as the diasporic South Asian communities look\nto the literatures by the South Asian writers for understanding and\nknowledge of South Asian culture, when some of these very writers\n(the diasporic ones) feel the need to have their writings checked for\ncultural accuracy and authenticity.) Diasporic South Asian women\u2019s\nliterature is a space in which self-identity is frequently discussed\nand negotiated. Consequently, it was found that the diasporic\nSouth Asians in particular read and respond to writings by South\nAsians as a way of informing themselves of their culture and social\nidentity.\nDiasporic literature inevitably produces some generalisations. In\nmaking certain generalisations, some diasporic South Asian women\nwriters are seen to be propagating certain cultural images, implying\nthat that which may apply only in a certain section of society, is in\nfact the norm in the wider South Asian community. It is a diasporic\ntendency, Avtar Brah tells us, that \u2018tradition is itself continually\ninvented even as it is hailed as originating from the mists of time\u2019\n(Brah, 1996). Narayan further reminds us that people are \u2018susceptible\nto the suggestion that practices and institutions are valued merely\nby virtue of the fact they are long-standing\u2019 (Narayan, 1998), a\nsusceptibility that the diasporic South Asian community have no\nmonopoly over. In circulating stereotypes and playing with cliche\u00b4s,\nsome diasporic writers play a role in providing (mis)information on\nSouth Asians, thereby contributing to the creation of the global image\nof the South Asian culture.\nIt is clear that the writings of diasporic South Asians have greater\ninfluence over the shaping of a global South Asian image and identity.\nIn most cases, their writings are more widespread, more easily\naccessible, and better promoted than those of the home writers.\n256 L ISA LAU\nOne important factor contributing to the accessibility of diasporic\nSouth Asian women\u2019s literature (as opposed to literature by the home\nauthors) is that diasporic writing is generally more inclined to a\nhybridity of cultural norms, explaining South Asian culture even as\nit portrays it.\nReferences\nAligiah, George. 2001.
