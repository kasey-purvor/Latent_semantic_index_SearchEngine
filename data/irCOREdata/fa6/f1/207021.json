INTRODUCTION \nMultimedia plays an important part in the field of \ncommunication, as a facilitator for human-to-human \nconnection and as an information provider.  Users, as the \n\u2018ultimate\u2019 senders and receivers in the communication \nprocess, remain the central constituents of multimedia \ncommunication.  Research in multimedia that focuses on \nuser requirements has been relatively scarce compared to \nthat on technical requirements [1]. Traditional \ncommunication development has been demand (i.e. user) \nled, since the pressure of much technological development \nwas initiated by necessity.  Multimedia communication \ndevelopment has mainly been technology led, as it \ncontinues to reap the benefits from vast improvements in \ntechnological developments over the past few decades.  \nThis may partially explain why initially user needs have \nbeen comparatively overlooked in multimedia \ncommunication development.  Nonetheless, adapting to user \nrequirements is equally important.  The use of advanced \ntechnology will otherwise serve no more than \u2018bells and \nwhistles\u2019 to multimedia applications.  The case for \naddressing gender differences in user requirements is rooted \nin the context of supporting diversity in human \ncommunication.  Gender is a primary dimension of \n                                                          \n  \n1 Netdecisions Ltd, Elsinore House, 77 Fulham Palace Road, \nLondon W6 8JZ, UK \n2 Information Systems Department, London School of Economics, \nHoughton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK \ndiversity; the immutable differences of sex exert an impact \nthroughout each individual\u2019s life [2].  The case for \naddressing user requirements in multimedia communication \nrests on the argument that multimedia communication \nchanges interpersonal communication and the distribution \nof information in society.  By investigating the social aspect \nof the diversity of communication, multimedia technology \nshould have the potential to progress beyond those benefits \nprovided by technology.  \n \nWhilst multimedia technology itself may be constructed as \nneutral, many observers have identified the use of such \ntechnology in communication as deeply gendered [3-6].  As \ngender specific issues gradually become a recognized area \nof academic research, literature on women, multimedia \ntechnology and culture has been particularly prolific in the \npast two decades.  Research in this area began in the \nproceedings of conferences on women and computing.  \nThese conferences have provided opportunities for female \npractitioners from academia and industry to discuss gender-\nrelated issues.  These conferences tend to take on a \n\u2018feminist\u2019 approach, which focuses on the fight for equality \nfor women in the culture of technology.  Such an approach \ncan initially be divided into two main strands [7].  First, the \n\u2018women into technology\u2019 strand.  This strand addresses the \nlimited presence of women in technology and emphasizes \neducation, training and equal opportunity initiatives to \nincrease the number of women in the field.  Second, there is \nthe sociological and philosophical strand.  This strand \nfocuses on the nature of work involving technology and the \nlinks between technology and feminist history.  A third \nstrand of studies has now emerged as contemporary gender \nstudies shift from the traditional concerns about women in \nthe workplace towards the culture of computer ethics.  \nInterests are focused on perspectives, attitudes and identities \nof women in \u2018cyberspace\u2019 and are often attached to studies \nof the Internet [1, 8]. \n \nOften considered as an opposing viewpoint to the feminist \napproach, the \u2018humanistic\u2019 approach investigates situations \nand developments as they affect the welfare of both \ngenders, rather than addressing only that of women.  The \nargument is that information technology is likely to affect \nall those who use it, although the consequences may be \ndifferent for the different genders.  The approach takes the \nview that both gender and technology should be considered \nas cultural processes that are not fixed, but capable of \nTowards Accommodating Gender Differences in \nMultimedia Communication \nAmelia K.Y. Tong, Member, IEEE Computer Society1, Ela Klecun2  \n 2 \nadaptation and transformation.  It is with this notion that this \npaper discusses gender-related differences raised in \nmultimedia communication and seeks to recommend ways \nof how these differences should be addressed.  We argue \nthat gender differences should be accommodated rather than \nmade neutral in multimedia systems.  Our contribution is a \nproposal for a new model for this accommodation of gender \ndifferences in multimedia applications development. \n \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.  The next \nsection identifies the gender-related differences and \ndiscusses their relationships with the essential elements in \nmultimedia communication.  The paper then discusses how \nthese differences should be addressed, and describes the \nproposed model for accommodating gender differences in \nmultimedia communication. \n \nII. GENDER-RELATED DIFFRENCES IN MULTIMEDIA \nCOMMUNICATION \n  \nThe gender differences identified in this section are based \non observations, as described in the literature, of the ways in \nwhich gender issues are related to a variety of activities and \nabilities in a multimedia environment. It is no more possible \nto say that gender differences influence the developments in \nmultimedia technology, than to say that multimedia \ntechnology developments cause identifiable gender \ndifferences.  This is because in gender studies, no true \nexperiments in the strictest sense can be carried out. In an \nexperiment, as opposed to observation studies, the \nexperimenter has \u201ccontrol over a possible cause in the \ndifference in output\u201d of the process [9].  Fundamentally, a \ntrue experiment requires a variable to be manipulated, or \nsubjects to be randomly assigned to certain groups.  These \ncriteria cannot be satisfied in gender research, since \nresearchers can neither manipulate people's sex, nor \nrandomly assign people to male or female group.  On this \nbasis, gender research observations are mainly obtained \nfrom correlation studies, which may allow us to conclude \nthat two variables are affecting each other, never that one \ncauses the other. \n \nWith this distinction in mind, it should be noted that the \ndiscussion here is not driven by a conclusive experimental \noutcome, but is drawn from the correlation between the \ngender differences identified  and the essential elements in \nmultimedia communication. We define essential elements as \nthose that have high impact across the different areas of \nmultimedia applications.  The areas of multimedia \napplications include education, e.g. multimedia tutoring \nsystems; information services, e.g. public on-line databases; \ncollaborative work environments, e.g. video conferencing; \nand entertainment, e.g. virtual reality.  For the purposes of \nthis paper we restrict our discussion to professional \nmultimedia communication.  Entertainment applications are \ntherefore beyond the scope of this paper. \n \nBased on the review of gender related studies, identifiable  \ngender differences can be categorized here as interpersonal \ncommunication patterns, information retrieval interfaces, \nand empowerment. While the first two categories refer to \nhuman-to-human and computer mediated communication \n(CMC), empowerment refers to the context in which they \ntake place. These differences and their correlation with the \nelements in multimedia communication were first presented \nand discussed at the 5th International Conference on \nIntegrating Technology and Human Decisions in 1999.  \nFigure 1 extends the ideas developed at the conference and \nintroduced in a previous paper [10], and illustrates the \ncorrelation between the identified differences, the essential \nelements in multimedia communication and the causal \nrelationships between them.  \n \nFigure 1 near here. \n \nA. Communication Pattern \nThis issue addresses gender differences in human-to-human \ncommunication.  This difference is correlated to the \ninteractivity element in multimedia communication. \nInteractivity can be defined as the degree of interaction to \nwhich participants in a communication process have control \nover and can exchange roles in a mutual discourse [11-13].  \nInteractivity in multimedia applications includes not only \nhuman-to-machine or machine-to-machine connections, but \nalso most importantly human-to-human connections via \nmultimedia technology. The link between communication \npatterns and interactivity in multimedia is most evident in \ncollaborative work multimedia applications [14].  In \nmultimedia communication interactivity is an essential \nelement that emerges when the technology is employed \nacross different categories of application [15].  In \neducational applications a high degree of interactivity \nbetween the system and the learner-user is necessary for \nlearning to take place, otherwise multimedia communication \nmay be no more than a one-way presentation of information \nin different media.  In information services applications \ninteractivity occurs when a user sends a message to the \nsystem expressing his\/her needs for certain information.  In \norder to perform as intended the system must first interpret \nthe user\u2019s message, act on the message by looking for the \ninformation, and finally respond to the user\u2019s message by \nproviding the information requested.  Interactivity in \nmultimedia communication is crucial in collaborative work \napplications.  This is due to the cooperative nature of \nactivities that multimedia technology aims to support. \n \nTo be able to illustrate how multimedia systems potentially \nalter communication patterns this section now discusses \nconventional communication. Empirical research has shown \nhow the two genders differ in conventional communication \npatterns [16].  In verbal communication, men\u2019s voices tend \nto be deeper and louder than women\u2019s.  They tend to be \nmore authoritative, talk more, interrupt more, and change \ntopics more often.  Women tend towards the styles that \n 3 \nfoster participation and communication.  They self disclose \nmore, use more personal references and emotional tone and \nlanguage.  In non-verbal communication, i.e. the type of \nbody language used while communicating, women tend to \nperform gestures such as sitting or standing with their legs \ntogether, taking up as little space as possible.  Men tend to \nexhibit the opposite behavior.  In terms of eye contact, men \nare more likely to \u2018look people in the eye\u2019, while women are \nmore likely to stare at those who are not looking at them \nand avert their gaze when speaking to others.  The most \ninfluential members communicating in a group are men and \nwomen who adapt features of the communication styles of \nthe other gender [17]; the most effective male \ncommunicators soften their speech and change topics less \noften abruptly than their male peers.  The most effective \nfemale communicators use more third person pronouns.  \nThey refuse to be interrupted and they speak to the group as \nwhole rather than to an individual person.  This \ndemonstrates that positive, inoffensive communication \nstyles that are used by one gender can be effectively used by \nthe other, indicating that effective communication can be a \nthoughtful and articulate process and no longer gender \nspecific. The reminder of this section considers to what \nextent multimedia technology supports this type of \ncommunication.  \n \nMultimedia technology developments provide alternative \ncommunication channels at both the social, as well as the \nprofessional level. The Internet, and the use of electronic \nmail, is now a common form of multimedia communication.  \nThe way in which people \u2018converse\u2019 with others on email is \ndifferent from other forms of communication.  Long and \nformal messages may have the same form and style as their \npaper counterparts.  Short requests and small pieces of \ninformation can be quite succinct when compared to direct \npersonal interaction or with a telephone call. However, \nthere is conflicting evidence as to what extent, if at all, these \ndevelopments alter communication patterns with respect to \ngender differences [18, 19].  Being mainly text-based, email \nmessages often lack the accompanying features such as \nvoice inflection and body language.  This might be seen as a \npositive note towards greater control by users over the \ndisplay of their gender attribute in a social context. \nAlthough pseudonymity is not an option for professional \ncommunication, CMC (particularly email) may alleviate \nsome of problems of face-to-face communication \nencountered by women. For example, Lind [14] conducted a \nstudy of face-to -face and virtual work teams (using email \nand file-sharing) and concluded that women appeared to be \nmore satisfied with the virtual group experience that the \nmen did. Lind hypothesizes that the lack of non-verbal cues \nand the structure of an email-enabled virtual group may \nhave allowed for more equal group participation. While \nemail may not be taking the place of traditional work \nmeeting completely, passing information by this means \nmight promote a more direct, less-gender specific approach \nto communication.  However, there is some evidence that \nthe use of computers to mediate communication leads to \nmore aggressive behaviors and the use of emotionally \ncharged language [16, 20].  Furthermore, in a study of two \nelectronic discussion groups, Herring [18] observed that \nmale and female academic professionals did not participate \nequally in discussions. A small male minority dominated the \ndiscourse. Thus despite democratizing potentials of the \ntechnology, there is growing evidence that social \nrelationships in electronic forums mirror many key aspects \nof face-to-face relationships [19]. \n \nFurthermore, multimedia technology such as video \nconferencing can preserve the non-verbal communication \nstyles, even though such usage has not been as popularized \nas expected because of the costs.  The technology itself can \nact as a barrier to direct personal communication, e.g. some \nmay initially find it unnatural to speak to an image on the \nscreen.  If the feminist interpretation of the world\u2019s view on \nwomen is adopted, one may worry that such communication \ncan be dominated by men, following the notion that women \nare more likely to be intimidated by technology [21].  \nStudies have shown that visual cues engender a strong sense \nof social presence [22]. An analysis of a professional Web \nsite for teachers that features \u2018virtual classroom visits\u2019, i.e. \nvideo clips of teachers teaching, and the asynchronous \nforums for discussing the videos, uncovered unintentional \nbias in the representation of gender [23]. Although there are \nmore female than male teachers, females were \nunderrepresented in video clips. This bias was reflected in \nasymmetries in participation by males and females in the \ndiscussions. Although, no females had their videos refused \n(i.e. less females submitted their video clips to the web site), \nHerring [23] argues that designers of CMC systems should \ntake gender into account when developing such multimodal \ninterfaces, and more actively encourage female \nparticipation, as well as giving them more prominent \nposition. Beyond this, very few studies, if any, have been \nconducted to raise any gender issues in the context of video \nconferencing. This is an area that needs further research. \n \nB. Communication Interface \nThis issue addresses gender differences in human to \ncomputer communication. This difference is related to both \nthe information retrieval and the information presentation \nelements, and is emphasized in all areas of multimedia \napplications.  \n1) Information retrieval \nInformation retrieval, in short, is the process of matching \nqueries posed by users to the (traditionally text-based) \ndocuments available in a given search space [24].  A high \nlevel of interactivity between the user who poses the \nqueries, and the agent which carries out the match is \ntherefore essential for effective information retrieval.  In \ntraditional text-based information retrieval an index is \ncreated from a set of documents (i.e. the given search space) \nto which queries are applied by users to satisfy their \ninformation needs.  Effectiveness in satisfying these \ninformation needs is often measured by the agent\u2019s ability to \n 4 \nretrieve all relevant documents from the search space, and \nthe agent\u2019s ability to return only the relevant documents.  \n \nIn educational applications student-directed activities are \nadvocated as a means to move away from passive textbook \nand lecture activities [25].  Many multimedia tutoring \nsystems provide opportunities for learners to explore \ntutorial content non-linearly.  Learners are encouraged to \nfind out information for themselves [26], e.g. by \nformulating their own queries and posing them to the \nmultimedia tutoring system.  Information retrieval in this \napplication can take the form of allowing the learner-user to \nchoose a topic to learn in the domain, and the multimedia \ntutor subsequently retrieving the appropriate material \nrelated to the topic requested by the user.  It can also take \nthe form of letting the learner-user ask different questions \nabout the domain, and the multimedia tutor retrieving \nrelevant information to answer the user\u2019s questions.  \nAdaptive information retrieval is essential for the success of \ninformation services dealing with the diversity of needs of \nthe information seekers [27].  In collaborative work \napplications information retrieval takes place when team \nmembers search for and manipulate information in \ndistributed databases. \n \nThere are two basic types of multimedia retrieval methods: \nretrieval via databases, and retrieval via links.  In databases, \nthe user has to choose appropriate search terms and the \nsystem then looks for these terms, either in the title of the \ndocument (not necessarily text only), in the index list, or in \nthe content of the document.  This method is highly \nstructured.  However, it is often difficult to find and process \nthe right terms.  The links method relies on connections \nbetween two documents, which have been created by the \nauthor of the documents.  This method is comparatively \nunstructured, undirected and often follows intuition [28].  \nIntuition can be perceived as having an immediate insight to \narrive at a true, or at least a highly plausible view, without \nconsciously stepping through evidence or logical sequences.  \nIn links retrievals, however, going through large and \nunstructured volumes of documents must include some \nsensible approach. In the course of her research Turkle [29] \nfound that women and men have different attitude to using \ncomputers. She labels feminine style of computer usage, as \n\u2018soft\u2019 mastery, which she depicts as bottom-up or bricolage, \nakin to intuitive and holistic style of \u2018non-Western\u2019 science. \nCorrespondingly, \u2018hard\u2019 mastery (preferred by more males \nthan females) is more rule-driven, and based, for example, \non the analytical style of \u2018Western\u2019 philosophers. This \nimplies that female users may benefit from a different \nretrieval route and in turn a different retrieval interface to \nmale users.  However, these findings are not conclusive. For \nexample, a study of 28 university students has shown that \nboth genders used similar searching techniques [28]. Even if \nwe all agree that significant gender differences in cognitive \nabilities exist, this does not essentially imply different \ninterfaces for different genders, as an interface should be \nconstructed to be useful to different users and environments \n[30].  Specialized interfaces for specialized users only are \nneither practical nor efficient in system development. \nFurthermore, as Pohl [28] argues such specialization may in \nitself be gender stereotyping and restrict women\u2019s \nparticipation and usage of the Internet. Thus, this paper \naddresses the issue of providing effective means of retrieval \nfor both genders. \n \n2) Information Presentation \nFor information retrieval activities to serve their purpose, \nthey need to be supported by the delivery of the retrieved \ncontent to the information seeker.  One of the factors \naffecting the effectiveness of such delivery is how the \ninformation is presented in terms of form, i.e. the medium \nused [31].  Research in information visualization has been \nexamining the effectiveness of the different forms of visual \npresentation of information, ranging from comparing user \npreference and performance with tables and graphs \n(different formats) [32], to investigating the effectiveness of \nreading music from an \u2018animated\u2019 screen versus paper \n(different media) [33].  Current research has shown an \nincreasing interest in the usability of the various means of \ndisplay.  This interest has, in part, been fostered by \nincreases in capacity and the ease of inclusion of the \ndifferent media in a computing system [34]. \n \nInformation presentation plays a significant role in all \napplications of multimedia communication.  Findings from \neducational psychology indicate that people learn more \nefficiently and better retain what they have learnt if the \nlearning process involves more than one medium, and that \ninteractive multimedia systems support \u2018learning by doing\u2019 \nactivities [35-37].  For example, text illustration may be \nmade more effective by adding graphics, sound effects, or \nanimation.  However, excessive usage of multimedia may \nbe distracting and may decrease the efficiency of learning \n[38].  Information presentation with the appropriate medium \nfor individual learners is therefore crucial to the facilitation \nof teaching and learning in multimedia tutoring systems.  \nInformation presentation also has a profound impact in \ninformation services applications.  Information presentation \ndetermines what is visually or audibly accessible and what \nis hidden.  Therefore, it directly influences the physical \naccess to information [13].  The form in which information \nis presented must match the needs of the information seeker, \ne.g. if he\/she is unable to see, then visual display is an \ninappropriate presentation of information.  Moreover, \nfindings in behavior psychology in \u2018conditioned responses\u2019 \nindicate that an individual\u2019s information seeking behavior is \ncaused and affected by the stimuli in the environment he\/she \nis immersed in, which in turn is determined by how \ninformation is presented.  In collaborative work \napplications, members in a team carrying out different tasks \nmay require the same piece of information presented to \nthem to aid their work.  The form in which information is \npresented to the different members may vary according to \nthe nature of their tasks.  For example, the main team \nmembers of an operational unit in an air traffic control team \n 5 \nfor a certain sector of traffic are the executive and the \nplanning controllers.  The executive controller, whose main \nresponsibility is to maintain the separation standards within \nthe sector, makes use of information presented visually and \naudibly.  The planning controller, whose responsibility is to \ncoordinate the traffic passing in and out of the sector, makes \nmore use of the information presented in audio, which keeps \nhim in contact with the controllers in adjacent sectors [39]. \n \nMultimedia information presentation faces more complex \ninterface problem than text-based information retrieval \nsystems.  Apart from visualization and layout of multimedia \ndocuments, the most intriguing issue arises from the fact \nthat non-textual information may mean different things to \ndifferent users.  As far as thinking and interpretation are \nconcerned, there are basic differences that parallel the \nphysical differences between men and women.  Research on \ngender differences in cognitive abilities has shown \nsignificant differences in visual-spatial abilities [28].  These \ninclude spatial perception, mental rotation, spatial \nvisualization, and spatio-temporal ability.  Multimedia \ncommunication has transformed traditional discourse of \ngraphics from two dimensional to four dimensional by \nincluding virtual reality.  More considerations and studies in \nvisual modeling for the two genders will help bring together \nthe differences in perception, as well as efficiency in the \ndifferent methods of communicating and constructing \nmeaning [40]. \n \nA study by Passig and Levin [41], correlating gender and \nmultimedia interface, suggests that the visual design of the \nmultimedia interface, the way the information is presented \nand the ease of dialogue between the user and the system \naffect the user, both in terms of understanding the material \nand the desire to use it. A study by Gulz [42] suggests that \ninterface preferences tend to correlate with style of thoughts \nas well as with gender. Thus, in the study when presented \nwith two different interfaces for the same application more \nwomen (7) than men (3) preferred the person oriented \nversion, while the spatially oriented version was chosen by \nmore men (8) than women (4). Yet, elaborated spatial \nframeworks in software are more frequent than equally \nelaborated social frameworks [42]. Furthermore, there is a \nlegacy in computer culture of masculine images of \ncompetition, sport and violence, and metaphors like \nworkbenches, tool kits, drives and engines and so forth [43]. \nSuch interfaces may discourage some females from \nembracing computers. \n \nThe significance of the correlation between gender \ndifferences and the combined effect of information retrieval \nand presentation is more pronounced in the education \nsetting of multimedia applications.   This is exhibited \nthrough the cognitive style of the learner [44].  In the past \ndecade, learning theorists have suggested different learning \nstyles that are gender-related [45].  Majority of the males, \nand some females exhibit autonomous, independent learning \nstyle, whereas majority of the females, and some males, \nexhibit relational, interdependent style.  In terms of \nknowledge and intellectual development, males prefer \nchallenge and debate, individual activities, and the use of \nexternal evidence, while females tend towards inter-\nindividual, collaborative activities. The gender differences \nin learning affect the way information should be retrieved \nand presented to the learner, which in turn affects the use of \ntutoring strategies in the educational discourse.  This aspect, \ntogether with the content of the educational material, has \nextensive effects on tutoring strategy selection on \neducational multimedia applications [44], where multiple \nrepresentations of the same content are possible. \n \nSo far this paper discussed gender differences in \ncommunication pattern and interface (including information \nseeking behavior, visualization and perception), and \nlearning styles. The literature surveyed indicates that gender \ndifferences in cognitive styles and abilities do exist. These \ndifferences lead to the conclusion that women prefer \ndifferent communication pattern and interface.  However, \nthese differences cannot be seen as simple dichotomies but \nrather as positioned on a continuous scale. Furthermore, this \npaper argues that technology and gender are not fixed and \ngiven but are dynamic forces that interact with each other \n[28, 46, 47]. This means that that gender differences are not \nonly inherent (physiological) but are socially constructed \nand thus need to be considered in their social context. The \nnext section discusses this context in relation to multimedia \ncommunication and women\u2019s empowerment. \nC. Empowerment \nRather than being specifically related to any elements or any \nmultimedia applications, this difference is raised initially as \na consequence of the ease of access to the type and amount \nof information through multimedia communication [10].  \nGender studies on empowerment by multimedia \ncommunication have been undertaken in three different \nperspectives.  The first perspective entails global cultural \nstudies of female in developing countries, and investigations \non how these female are empowered as a result of having \naccess to multimedia communication [48].  The second \nperspective adopts a feminist approach and examines the \nrelationship between multimedia communication and \nfemale\u2019s self-development, e.g. gaining more confidence, \nsense of acceptance, and feeling more as part of a group \nthrough women electronic bulletin boards [49].  The third \nperspective approaches the issue from an organization \nbehavioral viewpoint, and examines opportunities for a \nchange of power and work structure between the two \ngenders [50].  It is beyond the scope of this paper to address \nthe first two perspectives of empowerment.  Instead, it will \nadopt the third perspective and explore this difference under \nthe organization collaborative work setting of multimedia \napplications.   \n \nThe combination of demographic, organizational, social and \ntechnical factors evolved from the advancement of \nmultimedia communication cause the nature of work \n 6 \nrelationship to undergo radical changes.  The lower level \nworkers have now been \u2018empowered\u2019 with more \nresponsibility due to the availability of information.  A \ntelesales personnel, for example, who originally was only in \ncharge of sales is now \u2018empowered\u2019 to deal with accounts as \nwell, with the availability of the customers\u2019 account detail \non the computer screen.  The traditional, usually male \nmanagers can no longer rely on status and authority to \ninfluence activities, but need to empower teams, possibly \nlower ranks and female dominated, to make their own \ndecisions [10].  However, the traditional view of the \ngendered roles still stands, even though the roles may not be \nas hierarchical and rigid as they once were.  The predictions \nprevailed in Europe in the 1970s and 1980s that females \nwere less prepared than males to accommodate changes due \nto technological innovations, and that female would remain \ntechnology-illiterate, to the extent to which they would be \nexcluded from decision making at work [51].  A recent \nstudy in gender, work and organization [52] shows that \nalthough females today are definitely not technology-blind, \nlittle progress has been made in terms of their involvement \nin decision making. Furthermore, a study by Robertson et \nal. [53] concludes that women in computing (in academia \nand industry) continue to be segregated both horizontally \nand vertically, i.e. they are associated with \u2018softer\u2019 aspects \nof the profession (e.g. sales or marketing), and are \nunderrepresented in higher posts.  \n \nSome argue the reason for this bias is that females do not \nutilize technology as aggressively as males [54].  On the one \nhand, research has indeed suggested that men tend to \ndisempower in order to gain submissive control, whereas \nwomen prefer to empower others through negotiation in \norder to achieve consensual power [55].  From this \nviewpoint, multimedia communication may potentially \nreinforce and magnify stereotypical gendered behavior \nrather than create a balance for both genders.  On the other \nhand, there are also reports indicating that women have \nbeen increasingly taking advantage of multimedia \ncommunication to \u201cbecome their own bosses\u201d by setting up \ntheir own businesses [56], especially in the information-\nintensive service providing sector. \n \nTaking less of a feminist viewpoint, it is clear from the \nliterature in the work process, technology studies and \norganizational studies domains, that information has \nnonetheless been unevenly allocated in organizations, not \nmerely restricted in the \u2018gendered\u2019 nature.  \u2018Knowledge\u2019 has \nbeen identified as a political device used by some groups to \nsecure protection of their employment, high pay and status, \nand to exclude others [50]. Gender-related difference in this \nrespect appears to have a larger impact on female workers, \nnot only because of the original personal traits differences \nof the genders, but the subsequent differences in terms of \nthe nature of the jobs they do, and the way in which these \njobs are organized [50].  More studies need to be carried \nout before one can answer the question of how multimedia \ncommunication can be utilized to help to distribute \ninformation and to facilitate social and work-related \nnetworks to compromise the difference of the genders. \n \nIII. THE MODEL FOR ACCOMMODATING GENDER \nDIFFERENCES IN MULTIMEDIA COMMUNICATION \n \nThe previous section has identified and discussed the \nsignificance of gender-related differences in multimedia \ncommunication. This section makes recommendations on \nhow these differences should be treated and proposes the \nmodel for accommodating gender differences in multimedia \ncommunication. This model is contrasted with different \napproaches adopted in the past.  \n \nThe section begins by illustrating in Figure 2 the ideas from \ntraditional gender studies and approaches for addressing \ngender differences that draw on them. Figure 2 does not \nrepresent a coherent model, as such a model does not exist. \nIts aim is merely to serve as a reference point from which \nour model (illustrated in figure 3) can be grounded.  \n \nFigure 2 near here \n \nBoth, the approaches depicted in Figure 2 and our model \nare based on the assumption that gender differences in \nmultimedia communication exist. Where they differ is in the \nrecommendations for treating them. Thus the other \napproaches recommend the narrowing or neutralizing of \ngender differences. This has led, for example, to calls for \ndeveloping different interfaces or systems and web sites \nfocused on women\u2019s needs [47]. Alternatively, adaptive \nintelligent interfaces, are proposed as having potential to \nmeet different needs of different user groups [27, 57]. In \nterms of empowerment, feminist scholars focus exclusively \non the needs of women and fight for equality between \ngenders. \n \nOur model for accommodating gender differences in \nmultimedia communication, shown in figure 3, provides a \nnovel and alternative viewpoint in the treatment of the \ndifferences identified.  As opposed to that of traditional \ngender studies, the model recommends that the differences, \nalthough significant and consequential, need not always to \nbe narrowed or neutralized.    \n \nThe model supports ideas from research in related \ndisciplines such as cultural, cognitive and organizational \nstudies, and draws upon solutions which are directed \ntowards recognizing and accommodating, rather than to \nnarrowing and eliminating the differences.  The model \nbuilds on exploratory studies in the use of multimedia \nsystems by different genders. For example, Passig and \nLevin [58] after examining the differences of satisfaction \nwith multimedia learning interfaces between boys and girls, \nsuggest that careful design of multimedia interface can \nmake the use of multimedia content appealing and satisfying \nto both genders. Spilker and Sorensen [47], analyzing how \n 7 \ngender is constructed in multimedia form and content, \nreport on two multimedia products that have been designed \nin order to attract female users. The first one, JenteROM \u2013\naccording to the article\u2019s authors \u2013 is based on a \nconstruction of women as quiet, knowledge seeking but \ntechnically less competent users. The second product \u2013 \nHjemmeNett \u2013 is based on an assumption that women are \nseeking trust, broad access, flexibility and individualism. \nHjemmeNett embodies a belief that there is no need to \ngender the design of the web service to attract feminine \nusers but at the same time it does not assume that \ntechnology is neutral or without gender. It promotes an \napproach that takes gender into consideration while trying \nto create masculine as well as feminine spaces.  It is such a \nperspective that the model presented in this paper seeks to \ndevelop. Figure 3 illustrates the model, which consists of \nthe identified differences, the recommendations, and the \nrationale that supports the recommendations. The reminder \nof this section discusses the recommendations. \n \nFigure 3 near here. \n \nA. Realization and Acceptance of Differences \nThe gender differences in communication patterns arise \nfrom the differences in how males and females tend to \nexpress themselves in a conventional way.  As opposed to \nstudies, which propose to close the gap by utilizing \nmultimedia technology to neutralize gender interaction, the \nmodel advocates the recognition of the gender differences in \ncommunication pattern.  Its view is that in multimedia \ncommunication, existing conventional differences may \ninevitably be preserved, and that new differences may \neventually emerge.  Attempting to use technology to \nneutralize gender may bring about the adverse effect of \nstereotypical gendered behavior being reinforced and \nmagnified [59].  The issue here is the need to accommodate \nthe differences, by addressing these differences and \nadapting multimedia technology usage for both genders.  \nThis idea is, to some extent, reflected in user interfaces that \nprovide structured and unstructured retrieval methods. \nHowever, the model presented here is concerned not just \nwith retrieval methods but also with communication patterns \nand interfaces. Problems in inter-gender communication are \nsomewhat in line with the stumbling blocks in intercultural \ncommunication, which has been identified as [60]: (a) \nassumed similarity (e.g. an assumption that norms, beliefs \nand behavior patterns are shared amongst the participants), \n(b) language (problems arising from language \nmisinterpretations), (c) nonverbal misinterpretations, (d) \npreconceptions and stereotypes (e.g. stereotyping genders or \nraces), (e) tendency to evaluate (e.g. making comparisons), \nand (f) high anxiety. The first five points are most relevant \nto the recommendation being made here.  On the one hand, \nby learning not to assume that males and females should be \nthe same, this model emphasizes sensitivity to the fact that \nmale and female values and goals may differ, and generally \ntheir verbal and nonverbal language will vary as well.  On \nthe other hand, awareness of preconceptions and stereotypes \nwhich portray the other gender as \u2018different\u2019 can help to \navoid such stereotypes.  For example, although there are \ndifferences in multimedia communication pattern in both \ngenders, it is not appropriate to assume that all males \nexhibit the commonly described interruptive behavior, or \nthat all females are intimated by technology.  Instead of \nbeing annoyed by e.g. \u2018aggressive\u2019 communication style, it \nshould be recognized that it is a style, which as much part of \na gender\u2019s identity, as a religion is part of a culture.  The \ntask is to improve awareness and respect, rather than \nevaluation [61].  \nB. Creation of Metaphors for User Adaptation \nCommunication interface differences, i.e. gender \ndifferences in human to computer interaction, arise from the \ncognitive differences in perception, interpretation, learning \nstyles, information seeking and processing behavior \nbetween the genders.  The model recommends that these \ndifferences should be stressed when designing interfaces for \nmultimedia information retrieval and navigational \nenvironments.  Although a wealth of studies on cognitive \ndifferences between genders has existed for decades, it is \nonly recently when research such as navigating in \ninformation spaces and visualization of abstraction arose, \nthat cognitive modeling has become associated with user \nnavigation and information seeking activities.   \n \nAs opposed to advocating an interface that would adapt to \nthe cognitive differences of the genders when interacting \nwith multimedia applications, the model recommends the \ndesign of mechanisms for multimedia applications that \nwould allow the different genders to adapt to the \napplications themselves.  This recommendation is not a \nresult of skepticism towards the concept of adaptive \nintelligent interfaces, but more as an echo to the \nrecommendation of stereotyping avoidance discussed in the \nprevious recommendation.  Interests in the cognitive state of \nthe user have underpinned research on the models systems \nhave of users.  Research aimed at developing systems that \naccommodate models of the gender of users to adapt their \ninterface to gender differences may run into the problem of \nsimply including a selection of stereotypical behavior, \nwhich are then selected as most appropriate by the system to \nmatch the user [62].  Rather than implanting stereotypes of \nusers into systems for adaptive interfaces, an alternative \nstrategy would be to allow the system to tell the user about \nitself, such that the user could adapt to the interface of the \nsystem. This concept intuitively seems to contradict the now \nwidely accepted idea that it is the technology which should \nadapt to people, not vice versa.  This is not the case; the \napproach advocated here reinforces the importance of user \nrequirements and the need for technology to be designed to \nsuit users, but acknowledging that gender differences exist, \nit proposes how these can be accommodated, without \ndesigning different systems for different genders.  \n \n 8 \nThis approach has been acknowledged by others [57, 62].  \nCognitive studies have revealed that people do adapt to the \ninterfaces they use.  They do so by making an analogy of \nthe interface as a metaphor of something they are familiar \nwith [63].  The key in this context is for multimedia \napplication interface designers to consider the types of \nmetaphors that can be created by each gender from the \ninterface, and the ease of the creation of these metaphors for \neach gender. This approach differs from designing \ninterfaces that contain cognitive characteristics of both \ngenders and letting the users pick for themselves.  What is \nrecommended here is an attempt to articulate ultimately the \nuser\u2019s reflexive response, rather than raising the user\u2019s \nconscious actions.  This may also help users to avoid \nconsciously assuming stereotypical gendered behavior when \ninteracting in multimedia environments. This approach \nencourages the designers to cater for user requirements that \nare not immediately obvious or made explicit.  \n \nThe two recommendations above suggest that the gender \ndifferences observed should be accommodated rather than \nneutralized.  This stems from the humanistic standpoint \ntaken in this research.  The nature of these \nrecommendations is distinguished from that of the \"non-\nsexist\" approach [64].  Non-sexism believes that differences \narise from individuality and uniqueness, and therefore may \nnot address directly, if at all, the issue of equality.  It is \ntherefore perceived by some as playing down the \nimportance of gender. \n \nC. Organizational Learning \nIssues in gender related differences surrounding \nempowerment evolve from the advancement of multimedia \ncommunication that causes the nature of work relationship \nto undergo radical changes. The empowerment dimension \nof the model presented here is important because \ncommunication and information retrieval do not take place \nin a vacuum. Wider issues need to be considered if we \nintend to accommodate gender differences in multimedia \ncommunication. As Robertson et al. [53] suggest gender \nrelations of power within organizations are reproduced \nthrough processes of communication, through networks of \ngendered relationships and through wider legitimizing \nstructures. \n \nThe review carried out for this research has shown that there \nis a bias against females for \u2018powerful\u2019 jobs.  Empowerment \nis a multi-dimensional issue and no single set of \ncontingencies can be used to describe it.  It does not merely \ninvolve the delegation or distribution of power.  It involves \nhow leaders lead, how individuals and peers react, and how \nwork related processes are structured [65]. In coupling the \nutilization of multimedia technology with gender related \ndifference in empowerment, this paper recommends the \ninvestigation in organizational culture, and the nurture of \norganizational learning, before considering the exploitation \nof technology in this context. We acknowledge, however, \nthat feminism offers a partial view, and that gender is only \none (albeit very important) of variables that disadvantage \none group in relation to another. Thus, we advocate a \nhumanist approach. The true paradox of empowerment \noccurs when power and control are \u2018given away\u2019 or rather \nwhen people are given means to empower themselves.  \nFrom the findings in this research, it appears that \u2018power\u2019 is \npretty much still a male preserve.  Power will not be \ndistributed through the use of multimedia technology if \nthere is no will to give it away.  Organizations need to \nprovide a culture that promotes trust and inclusion for both \ngenders in a collaborative work environment.  Organization \nwith traditional, functional management cultures and \ndominated by masculine psycho-structure are not ready to \ncope with global diversity, the sharing of information to \nachieve complex goals and further self-development [65].  \nWithout the ability to envisage changing business needs, \norganizational dynamics and social changes, the benefits of \ntechnological innovations will never be fully realized.  \n \nIV. CONCLUDING REMARKS \nThis paper set out to address gender differences in \nmultimedia communication.  Firstly, the paper has \nillustrated that although no true experiments in the strictest \nsense can be conducted in gender-related issues, empirical \nresearch in many related disciplines such as education and \npsychology, have shown the significance of gender \ndifferences in multimedia communication. However, the \nmajority of research focuses on the use of email, the Internet \n(including retrieving information from the Web, \ncommunicating via list servers and chat rooms, or playing \nMulti-User Dungeons).  More research should be done in a \nbusiness environment, and include studies of the influence \nof video conferencing on gender differences in \ncommunication. Secondly, the paper has put across a novel \nviewpoint in terms of how the differences should be treated.  \nIt asserts that the differences should be accommodated, and \nnot necessarily neutralized.  Thirdly, the model has \ncontributed to multimedia development, by making a case \nfor the emphasis of socio-technical issues in multimedia \nresearch.  Multimedia communication is not a new topic, \nbut up to now it has been mainly approached from a \ntechnological viewpoint.  Gender-related differences are not \nthe only issues that need addressing when analyzing user \nrequirements in multimedia technology development.  From \nthe research undertaken in this paper, it is evident that social \nissues including ethics and culture should also be taken into \naccount.  \n \nFuture direction of work includes exploring further \nimplications of the main recommendations proposed by the \nmodel, both individually and in synthesis.  In view of the \nrich nature of gender issues and the extensive range of \nactivities made possible through multimedia \ncommunication, it would be an oversimplification to rest on \na small number of guidelines: rather, the guidelines are \nmany and some are implicit in this paper.  As with many \n 9 \nother existing tools and concepts for which no final \nevaluation is available, the value of the proposed model will \nonly be established through use or disuse.    \n \n \n \n 10 \nReferences \n \n[1] D.
