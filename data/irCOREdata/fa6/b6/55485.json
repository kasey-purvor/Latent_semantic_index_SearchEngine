The article \nhighlights the continued under representation of women in terms of the proportion of \ncouncillors who are women, and the \u201egender gap\u201f that exists in terms of council leadership \nand the portfolios that men and women hold on council cabinets or executives. It moves on to \na consideration of qualitative evidence that suggests that there are similarities and differences \nin the way that female and male councillors in leadership positions perceive of their roles and \nstyles. \n \n \nA consideration of the position of women in elected local government in England, Scotland \nand Wales is pertinent for three main reasons: firstly, there has been a slow but steady \nincrease in the proportion of councillors who are women over the last thirty years; secondly, \nthere have been a number of changes to local government in the United Kingdom which have \nled to questions over the role of councillors, including around \u201eleadership\u201f; and thirdly \ndebates over descriptive and substantive representation have encouraged questions as to what \ndifference women councillors might make. \n \nFrom the late 1990s the government has placed considerable emphasis upon local leadership, \narguing, for example, that \u201eWhatever the causes, the Government believes that the failure to \nmaximise the potential of locally elected representatives to act in a leadership role as \nadvocates and champions of local communities is a major obstacle to our ambitions for civil \nrenewal and improved public services\u201f.1 Consequently local government in the United \nKingdom, particularly in England and Wales, has been \u201eencouraged\u201f, as part of central \ngovernment\u201fs modernisation agenda, to adopt new forms of decision-making structures, based \nupon the view that these would be more efficient, and would enhance accountability and local \nleadership through a clearer linkage of individuals to policy making and to outcomes (in \nScotland greater attention has arguably been paid to the electoral system, with the \nintroduction of the single transferable vote system for local government elections from May \n2007). These new structures have focused upon the replacement of the traditional committee \nsystem with leaders and cabinets, leaving the majority of councillors as \u201ebackbenchers, \nalthough in a small number of instances local authorities have shifted to directly elected \nmayors. \n  \nThe government has continued to emphasise that it wishes to see more visible local \nleadership, and in late 2006 published a White Paper for England, Strong and Prosperous \nCommunities, Chapter 3 of which includes discussion of \u201eMore diverse and representative \ncouncillors\u201f, \u201eCouncillors as democratic champions\u201f and \u201eStronger leadership\u201f. Under the \nlatter heading, the White Paper states that \u201eThe Government believes that it is important that \ncouncils move towards having more stable and more visible political leadership. Our research \nshows that leadership is the single most significant driver of change and improvement in local \nauthorities\u201f,2 and contains a promise to legislate so that in future there will be three models of \nexecutive arrangement: a directly elected mayor with a four year term; a directly elected \nexecutive with a four year term; or an indirectly elected leader with a four year term. In each \nof these models the government states that \u201eall executive powers will be vested in the mayor \nor leader\u201f, making that role even more important. \n \nAs part of the programme of modernisation since 1997, including local government, the \nLabour government has recognised that \u201eElected representatives are a long way from being \nbroadly representative of the communities that they serve\u201f in terms of gender, age and \u201erace\u201f, \nand that \u201eBeing representative means being able to attract more women and more people from \na range of diverse backgrounds\u201f, implying at the least an acceptance of some of the arguments \nfor greater equality of representation and descriptive representation.\n3\n However, the \ngovernment has also stated that \u201eThere is no evidence to suggest\u2026 that the election of women \nor ethnic minority councillors necessarily means equalities are improved or introduced into \nemployment and\/or services within local government\u2026 It should also be noted that it is not \nnecessarily the case that a councillor who is from a particular group will identify with and \nunderstand the needs and circumstances of that group\u201f, again touching upon debates around \ndescriptive and substantive representation.\n4\n In the 2006 White Paper for England, Strong and \nProsperous Communities, the government developed an argument more closely related to \nutility, and in particular legitimacy, suggesting that \u201eIf democratic representatives are to \ncommand the confidence of their communities then they need to reflect the diversity of their \nlocal communities. Groups that are under-represented are more likely to believe that their \nperspectives are overlooked and disengage from the democratic process\u201f.5 \n \nIt has sometimes been argued that local government has been more accessible to women than \nnational politics, for example, being inevitably more local, making it easier to integrate the \npotential demands of work, family and political life; having more seats and less competition \nfor them; and being more open for women generally, as reflected in the promotion of equal \nopportunities for women staff and having women\u201fs issues more firmly on the agenda.  \n \nIt is worth noting that involvement in local government is important (in the UK at least) also \nbecause it is a significant training ground and pathway into national politics. Wilson and \nGame point out that following the 1997 general election 56% of MPs (62% of the 1997 \nintake) had experience as councillors,\n6\n while in the first Scottish Parliament 40% of MSPs \nhad local government experience\n7\n and in the first National Assembly for Wales 38% of AMs \nhad been councillors.\n8\n \n \nThese debates clearly reflect those around descriptive representation. Where women are \nconcerned Phillips has argued for the \u201epolitics of presence\u201f, including to address past and \ncontinued injustices which require that trust be given only to descriptive representatives, to \nallow historically excluded groups to get their ideas, issues and perspectives on the political \nagenda, and to revitalise democracy by demonstrating a commitment to diverse representation \nwhich in turn will encourage greater participation and legitimacy for democratic institutions.\n9\n \nFrom another perspective, analysing the 2001 British Election Survey, Campbell has \nsuggested that there are gender differences in policy priorities between men and women in the \nUnited Kingdom, with women being more likely to prioritise education and healthcare issues, \nand men more likely to see the economy as the most important election issue, which she \nargues supports Phillips\u201f call for gender quotas as \u201ethere is evidence that men and women \nwant slightly different things from the political system and these differences need to be \nrepresented in order for a meaningful debate to ensue\u201f.10 Similarly Mansbridge has argued \nthat democracy works better if there is \u201eproportional descriptive representation\u201f, with \ndisadvantaged groups requiring full levels of representation for a variety of reasons including \ncritical mass, dispersion of influence and a range of views within the group.\n11\n For such writers \nit is generally women\u201fs life experience that links descriptive and substantive representation, \nwith that life experience making it more likely that women representatives will take up \nwomen\u201fs issues. \n \nThere is clearly a potential weakness in the attempts to suggest that including individual \nmembers of a group, such as women, is sufficient to represent the group\u201fs perspective, and if \na white middle class woman cannot speak for a black woman or a poor woman, how can they \nrepresent the collective experience of women as a group. Young recognises that there are \ndifferences between the represented and their representatives and argues that these have to be \nacknowledged and affirmed. However, she also suggests that what is necessary is \naccountability and authorisation, rather than simply descriptive representation.\n12\n Given the \ncomplex and dynamic nature of representation the important thing is therefore to ensure that \ncitizens can appropriately choose their representatives and hold them accountable, so that any \nassessment of representation will depend upon the behaviour of representatives. \n \nHowever, Dovi criticises this view, giving as an example Young\u201fs claim that an Asian \nAmerican could have the perspective of an African American, arguing that \u201eIf Asian \nAmericans can possess an African-American perspective and thereby satisfy the requirements \nof being descriptive representatives for African-Americans, so can whites\u201f.13 Dovi notes that \nfew of those arguing for greater descriptive representation (greater presence) have said \nanything about the criteria by which such representatives should be chosen. She argues that \nthere is a need for such criteria in part because there are many differences within groups, \nwhilst also suggesting that these representatives, whilst paying special attention to overlooked \ninterests, should retain the autonomy to \u201ereasonably interpret those interests in a variety of \nways\u201f. She therefore argues that the criterion for identifying these individuals should be that \n\u201ePreferable descriptive representatives have strong mutual relationships with dispossessed \nsubgroups\u201f, with the mutuality being grounded in a mutual recognition and interactive \nrelationship between representatives and represented, and dispossession referring to groups \nthat are unjustifiably excluded from or by the political process and which thus lack the \npolitical and economic resources necessary for effective representation. \n \nClosely allied to the idea of descriptive representation in relation to women and politics has \nbeen the concept of \u201ecritical mass\u201f, with the notion that as the proportion of women in elected \nassemblies increases, this will in turn lead to better levels of substantive representation and \nthat at some stage (varying from levels of around 15 to 40%) political behaviour, policy \nagendas (including greater attention to women\u201fs issues) and institutions will be transformed. \nHowever, whilst this view has led to increased attention being paid to the levels of women \nrepresentatives, it has also been criticised as, for example, individuals do not necessarily \n\u201estand for or speak for the groups that they come from, higher proportions of women in \nassemblies do not necessarily lead to changed agendas, whilst it is also the case that smaller \nproportions of women can be effective in bringing new issues on to the agenda\u201f.14 \n \nThe ideas of descriptive and substantive representation, and of critical actors, Celis et al [AS \nDISCUSSED BY CELIS ET AL IN THIS ISSUE?],\n15\n are also relevant to debates around \npolitical leadership. While there has been debate about the links between descriptive and \nsubstantive representation, and the importance of positional power in facilitating the \nsubstantive representation of women,\n16\n the increasing emphasis on leadership at local and \nregional level in recent years means that any \u201eunder-representation\u201f of women (or of any \nother \u201eminority\u201f groups) may be exacerbated by the greater centralisation of power on one \nindividual (such as an elected mayor) or a small group of individuals (in the case of leader \nand cabinet\/executive models), as well as by the apparently growing difference between \n\u201efrontbench\u201f and \u201ebackbench\u201f or non-executive councillors,17 as, if most of the senior post-\nholders are male, the representation of women would effectively be decreased in terms of \ndecision making positions and power within local authorities.  \n \nMethods \nThere were effectively two stages to the empirical elements of this work. The first involved \nthe collection and analysis of secondary data from local authorities in England, Scotland and \nWales on the models of decision-making adopted, the numbers of male and female \ncouncillors, the proportions of female and male councillors in senior positions, and, where \nrelevant, the portfolios for which they were responsible. This was gathered primarily through \nthe examination of authorities\u201f web pages, supplemented by examination of The Municipal \nYearbook, and, where necessary, by telephone or email contact with councils. This provided a \ncomprehensive picture of the position as at May 2006. \n The second phase of the research involved in-depth, largely qualitative interviews, either \nconducted face-to-face or by telephone, with 36 individuals in leadership positions from a \nvariety of forms or authority (county and district councils, London boroughs, English unitary \nand Scottish and Welsh councils), from the three main political parties and independents, and \nfrom councils with one party majorities, coalitions and minority administrations. There are \nalways potential risks in approaches that rely upon self-reporting, but in this instance, with all \ninterviews being conducted on a confidential basis, with there being no potential benefit or \nrisk to individuals in terms of either positive publicity or fit with party policy, there was no \nreason for respondents to speak with less than absolute candour, and indeed the willingness of \nmany to give their views in a forthright and open manner, even when potentially clashing \nwith party positions, suggests that they did so. \n \nThis analysis concentrates on England, Scotland and Wales (Northern Ireland is excluded), \nbut in general reference is only made to each of these countries where there is a significant \ndegree of difference across them. \n \nThe descriptive representation of women in local government \nLocal government councillors in the United Kingdom remain far from descriptively \nrepresentative \u2013 well under one-third are female, only four per cent are non-white, and more \nthan half are aged over 60. They are also more likely to be educated to degree level than the \nrest of the population, and are more likely to come from managerial or professional-type \noccupations, although many are not in employment, including as a result of retirement and\/or \nbecause they have become full-time councillors. \n \nAlmost regardless of the debates around descriptive and substantive representation of women, \nthere remain important issues, including in relation to justice and participation, and the \nlimited numbers of women (and for that matter other groups, such as black people and  \ndisabled people) who have traditionally been candidates for and elected to local government \nin the United Kingdom. As noted above, since 1997 this is something that the Labour \ngovernment has paid some attention to as part of its \u201emodernisation\u201f agenda, including \nthrough discussion of \u201erepresentativeness\u201f, although, as noted elsewhere18 and as the local \ngovernment White Paper recognises, there are other associated issues such as trust in and \nlegitimacy of the political system, and the danger of continued marginalisation of some \ngroups. \n \nOne thing that is clear from any examination of the figures is that there has been a slow but \nsteady increase in the proportions of elected positions held by women in the United Kingdom, \nboth within the Westminster Parliament and at the local level. In parliament there was a very \nslow increase from 4% of MP being women in 1945 to 9% in 1992 and then a jump to 18% in \n1997, largely as a result of the Labour Party\u201fs decision to adopt all-women shortlists as part of \nthe selection process. The current figure is just under twenty per cent; in addition one of the \nearly actions of David Cameron when he became leader of the Conservative Party, was to \nsignal a desire to increase the number of women contesting winnable seats for his party, \nalthough whether this initiative will prove successful remains unclear. Within local \ngovernment, since the reorganisations of 1973\/4 there has also been a slow but clear trend of \nincreasing numbers of women standing as candidates and being elected to councils. The \nvariety of forms of local government make it difficult to aggregate the figures, but at the \ncounty council level in England there has been an increase in the percentage of women \ncouncillors from 15% in 1973 to 26% in 2000, with 24% of councillors elected in 2005 being \nwomen,\n19\n while in Scotland there has been an increase from 10% in Scottish regions and 13% \nin Scottish districts in 1974 to 23% in Scottish councils in 2003 and 2007.\n20\n \n \nGiven the relatively low levels of women in local government in the United Kingdom, it is \nperhaps unsurprising that much of the academic literature has focused on barriers to \nparticipation and recruitment, including individual circumstances, structural factors and \npolitical culture, and that there has been relatively little analysis of women\u201fs progression to \nmore senior positions within local authorities. In the 1990s Young and Rao, and Rao, \nsuggested that women were proportionately as likely as men to hold senior positions,\n21\n whilst \nBochel and Bochel found a similar picture for England and Wales, but also that in Scotland \nwomen were still less likely than men to have progressed to senior positions in elected local \ngovernment.\n22\n \n \nThe current research covered every local authority in England, Scotland and Wales. Of those \nin England and Wales, where the new decision making arrangements had been introduced, the \ngreat majority (83%) of councils had adopted the leader and cabinet model, 3% (11 \nauthorities) had a directly elected Mayor, and 1 council had a directly elected Mayor and a \nCity Manager. Thirteen per cent of councils (54, all small authorities) had chosen the \n\u201ealternative arrangements\u201f option. In Scotland, a small number of authorities had shifted to \nthe cabinet model, but the majority retained the committee system. \n \nThe number of women councillors on authorities varied from 1 to 39 (a mean of 13), but \nperhaps more importantly, the percentage of councillors who were women ranged from 3% to \n49%, with a mean of 27%, very much in line with other estimates for the country as a whole. \nIn terms of the political parties, 31% of Liberal Democrat councillors were women, 27% of \nLabour councillors, 25% of Conservatives and 23% of Independents. Looking briefly at the \nquestion of whether there is any relationship between the levels of remuneration (as measured \nby the basic allowance paid to councillors) paid by different authorities and the proportion of \nwomen councillors, our analysis suggests that there is not.  \n \nIt has sometimes been suggested that women are less likely to be represented in the most \nimportant political positions precisely because they are more important, as with the \ndesirability hypothesis and the lag hypothesis\n23\n, and the evidence from this research would \nappear to support such a view, at least in relation to the leaders of local authorities, with a \nsignificantly lower proportion of council leaders being women. Across the United Kingdom, \nonly 15% of leaders were women (19% in Scotland, 15% in England and 13% in Wales) and, \nwhere such a post existed, 15% of deputy leaders were women (16% in Wales, 15% in \nEngland and 10% in Scotland). Only eleven councils had a woman as both leader and deputy \nleader, compared with 237 that had male leaders and deputy leaders. However, while these \nfigures remain low, they do represent a marked increase on the 10% of authorities that we \nidentified as having female leaders in the early stages of modernisation in 2001.\n24\n There \nappears to be no statistically significant relationship between the percentage of councillors \nwho are women and the likelihood of an authority having a woman as leader. However, party \ndoes appear to have some influence here, with Labour, Conservative and Independent \ncontrolled councils being less likely (11, 15 and 17% respectively) than Liberal Democrat \ncontrolled councils (26%) to have women leaders. London Boroughs were by far the least \nlikely type of authority to have women leaders, with only 2 from 32 authorities (6%). Having \nnoted above that there is no apparent relationship between the level of basic allowances and \nthe proportion of women councillors it is perhaps worth noting that the same is true for the \nlevel of allowance for council leaders (which varied from \u00a3583 to \u00a371,856 per year) and the \nsex of those leaders.  \n \nThe introduction of new structures of decision making has inevitably changed the range of \nleadership positions within local government, with a shift away from committees, often with \npowerful chairs, to cabinets and executives with portfolio holders. A consideration of cabinets \nin England and Wales shows that these varied in size from 3 to 15 (with a mean of 8.4), while \nthe number of women cabinet members varied from 0 to 9 (with a mean of 2.1, or slightly \nlower than proportionate in relation to the numbers of male and female councillors). The \nproportion of women on cabinets had increased slightly compared with that found in 2001. \nTwenty-eight councils (8%) had no women in their cabinets, while no authorities had no men \nas cabinet members. There was a statistically significant relationship between the sex of the \ncouncil leader and the proportion of the cabinet who are women (Pearson\u201fs r = .302, \nsignificant at the .01 level), with women leaders being more likely to have more women in \ntheir cabinet. However, given that only about one-third of councils give the leader the power \nto choose their cabinet,\n25\n it is not clear whether this suggests that women leaders are more \nlikely to choose women for their cabinets or whether there is some other explanation, such as \nthat authorities with more politically powerful women are more likely to have one of those \nwomen as their leader. There was a stronger relationship between the percentage of \ncouncillors who are women and the proportion of the cabinet who are women (Pearson\u201fs r = \n.420, significant at the 0.01 level), and while this may in part simply be an artefact of having \nmore women available (although in itself this is obviously important), it might also reflect \nother pressures that arise from having greater \u201epresence\u201f, including greater implicit \nexpectation of more \u201erepresentative\u201f proportions of women and men in senior positions. \n \nIt is also interesting to go beyond merely the numbers of men and women on cabinets to look \nat the type of portfolios that female and male cabinet members hold, and this has implications \nfor some of the arguments around substantive representation, such as whether women \nrepresentatives seek to act in the interests of women. While this inevitably requires a \nsignificant compression of a wide range of descriptions, and in some instances the \nresponsibilities of cabinet members spread across more than one area, table 1 provides a \nuseful illustration of the positions in 2001 and 2006. \n \n1. Cabinet Members\u201f Portfolios, 2001 and 2006, percentages \n \n 2001 2006 \n Female Male Female Male \n \nSocial Services\/Inclusion\/Welfare 37 63 40 60 \nCulture\/Leisure 14 86 33 67 \nHousing 13 87 37 63 \nEnvironment\/Sustainability 29 71 27 73 \nEducation 50 50 26 74 \nCorporate Affairs 16 84 13 87 \nRegeneration\/Economic Development 15 85 18 82 \nTransport 20 80 17 83 \nCommunity\/Neighbourhood Services 36 64 35 65 \nCommunity Safety* 0 100 27 73 \nCustomer Services**   33 67 \nHealth**   46 54 \nOther 27 73 26 74 \n \n*The Community Safety percentages for 2001 are skewed by the fact that there was only one council that had such \na portfolio at that time. \n**Not collected for 2001 as the numbers were very small. \n The table suggests that women councillors are proportionately more likely to hold portfolios \nrelating to \u201ecaring\u201f areas, such as social services and social inclusion, housing, health and \ncommunity and neighbourhood services, while they are less likely to have responsibility for \nspheres such as corporate affairs, regeneration and economic development and transport. \nIndeed, in these latter instances these differences can be seen even more clearly in some of the \nfields that we have included within these overall headings, with 42 out of 46 portfolio holders \nfor regeneration, 36 out of 41 portfolio holders for finance, and 26 out of 29 portfolio holders \nfor transport being men. In Scotland, where many authorities have retained the committee \nsystem for decision making, a similar pattern emerges, with, for example, 35% of chairs of \nsocial work committees being female. \n \nIn addition to the creation of cabinets\/executives another feature of Labour\u201fs attempts to \nmodernise local government in England and Wales was the introduction of scrutiny \ncommittees, intended to hold the executive to account and to evaluate policy, including \npotentially prospectively as well as retrospectively. The number of scrutiny committees varies \nwidely, from one (including most district councils, many of which are quite small) to ten, \nwith the mean being 3.8. Our results show that three-quarters of scrutiny committees were \nchaired by men, and one-quarter by women. As with cabinet portfolios, authorities also vary \nwidely in the policy areas for which they establish scrutiny committees, but the same general \npattern emerges as for portfolio holders, with women being more likely to chair scrutiny \ncommittees relating to \u201ecaring\u201f topics (see table 2). \n \n2. Scrutiny Committee Chairs (examples), 2006, percentages \n \n Female Male \n \nChildren (92 committees) 41 58 \nCommunity\/Leisure (57 committees) 35 65 \nEnvironment\/Sustainability (142 committees) 20 80 \nHealth (130 committees) 40 60 \nOverview\/Scrutiny* (221 committees) 20 80 \nRegeneration (107 committees) 25 75 \nResources (77 committees) 13 87 \n \n*Includes those authorities with only one committee. \n \nClearly women are proportionately more likely to chair scrutiny committees relating to areas \nsuch as children, health and community\/leisure services, are much less likely to chair those \nrelating to resources, and are also somewhat less likely to chair committees relating to the \nenvironment\/sustainability or general overview\/scrutiny committees.  \n Some have identified horizontal gender segregation in many spheres of life, including in \npolitics, and these findings might appear to reflect such a view. However, while there are \nclearly some major differences in the extent to which responsibilities for different areas of \ncouncil work are held by men and women, what is not clear from these figures is the extent to \nwhich these are, or are not, the choices of the individuals concerned, or are, the result of other \ninfluences, such as bias or stereotyping. The limited evidence that we were able to gather \nfrom previous studies in the 1990s, when there was even greater under-representation of \nwomen in senior positions in local government, suggested that women were generally happy \nwith, and sometimes actively sought (although rarely in an attempt to substantively represent \nwomen), the positions which they held, but nevertheless we had retained some suspicion that \nthis gender clustering of areas of responsibility reflected perceptions of areas of \u201ewomen\u201fs \ninterests\u201f. Among the questions that might be considered here, therefore, are what are the \nreasons for these gender differences in roles, and what, if any, is the impact of these upon \ncouncils\u201f policy and practice? In terms of debates around the substantive representation of \nwomen, if it is assumed that critical actors are likely to be women, then their presence in \npolicy areas of importance to many women could be viewed as positive, but the evidence \ndoes not necessarily support such an interpretation. \n  \nIn relation to this latter point, what is of relevance and interest here therefore, is whether \nwomen are representing women\u201fs interests in these roles, and whether they are actively \nseeking to do so. It is of interest that these portfolios at least partly reflect the priority areas \nthat Campbell identified amongst women at the 2001 general election. The fact that only \naround half of authorities give leaders the power to allocate portfolios to the members of their \ncabinets\n26\n, and the degree of negotiation that takes place within and between political parties \nover the allocation of portfolios, means that at present it is not possible to explore this further. \nFurther research needs to be undertaken on the preferences of leaders and portfolio holders, \nand the negotiations that take place on the formation of cabinets and the distribution of policy \nresponsibilities. It is however worth noting that there does not appear to be any significant \ndifference in the distribution of portfolios by sex across the different political parties. \n \nRepresenting women\u2019s interests? \nIn the analysis of the more qualitative aspects of this research there are therefore a number of \nquestions that we might start to explore, although the extent to which we are able to do this is \ninevitably limited by the data available. These include: the extent to which men and women \ncouncillors may seek to represent the interests of women; how they might do this through \ntheir leadership roles; and whether there are any perceptions of gender differences in \napproaches to leadership, emphases upon particular policy areas, or in networking.  \n \nReturning to the issue of descriptive representation, among those people to whom we have \nspoken, women were considerably more likely to support the idea of descriptive \nrepresentation, such as with respect to gender and race, with around three quarters supporting \nsuch a notion (regardless of party), than men, of whom about half supported such a viewpoint. \nThis would appear to reflect similar findings at the level of the Westminster Parliament and \nparliamentary candidates,\n27\n and might, perhaps, be a result of women being more likely to see \ntheir gender, and therefore descriptive representation, as important. Among councillors there \nwas, however, widespread awareness of the barriers to this, both practical for individuals and \nin terms of the difficulties of getting measures adopted. Typical viewpoints were \u201eI totally \nsupport this\u2026 favour all-women shortlists\u201f (Female, Independent), \u201eYes, councils should be \nrepresentative, but getting people to stand is difficult\u201f (Female, Liberal Democrat), \u201eWe are \nnot into tokenism. It is a bit of a sideshow\u201f (Male, Labour), \u201eI would like to see it happen, but \nI would reject any measures that would make it happen\u201f (Male, Conservative). Several \npointed out that this should extend beyond gender and \u201erace\u201f so that councils should be \ngenerally more representative of their community. A number of respondents highlighted the \ndifficulties of getting younger people on councils. \n \nAgain, reflecting findings such as those of Childs that women MPs felt that they had a \ndifferent style from men,\n28\n and perhaps suggestions from some academic work that the \nsignificant presence of women can impact upon political style and decision-making, women \nrespondents were also far more likely to suggest (unprompted) that women operate differently \nfrom men (again, regardless of party), for example, putting forward views such as that women \nare more likely to seek consensus, take less directive approaches, be more open and \ntransparent and to compromise than are men (\u201eWomen see more grey issues; more willing to \ncompromise (Female, Labour); \u201eWomen are more touchy feely, work more on consensus\u201f \n(Female. Liberal Democrat), \u201eWomen are more open, transparent\u201f (Female, Conservative)), \nalthough a small number of men agreed with this view (\u201eWomen make better, more patient \nnegotiators\u2026 a more consensual approach\u201f (Male, Conservative)). Perhaps unsurprisingly, \ngiven these views, women were far more likely than men to identify skills such as \ncommunications and networking as important for councillors.  \n \nHowever, interestingly, and clearly relating to discussions of substantive representation and \nthe extent to which women representatives seek, expect, or feel a responsibility to represent \nwomen,\n29\n relatively few respondents, female or male, agreed that women bring different \nperspectives to issues or emphasise different policies or policy areas from men, with most \nsuggesting that \u201eOverall there isn\u201ft much difference\u201f (Female, Liberal Democrat), that \u201eMen\u201fs \nand women\u201fs issues are coming together \u2013 men are sharing roles\u201f (Female, Conservative), or \nthat it depends on the individual, although again a small number felt that different experiences \nmight have an impact (\u201eMen won\u201ft have experience of the same issues [such as] childbirth, so \non some issues they are likely to have a different perspective\u201f (Male, Conservative)). One \ncouncil leader cited the example, from their authority, of relatively recently elected \ncouncillors from different ethnic groups, arguing that they had brought forward issues that \nmight not otherwise have reached the council floor. So, whilst women councillors may be \nlikely to hold positions that have often been associated with areas of interest or importance to \nwomen, they do not claim to be seeking to substantively represent women or to be acting in \nthe interests of women, nor do they believe that they bring different perspectives or policy \nemphases. While some writers have argued that women representatives may feel a \nresponsibility to act for women more generally, the evidence from this research does not \nparticularly serve to either support or refute such a view. Indeed, it may be that with cultural \nchange, in theory if not in practice, sex differences in relation to such claims might in any \nevent be expected to diminish, as might also be expected with regard to leadership and \nmanagement styles, as discussed below. \n \nThe view of respondents that there is little or no difference in the perspectives and policy \npriorities of female and male councillors, serves to further confuse possible interpretations \naround the differences in cabinet portfolios (and indeed scrutiny committees chaired) \nidentified earlier, particularly when combined with the wide range of constraints that act upon \nleaders (the variety of mechanisms that exist include, in some instances, ruling parties, and in \nothers, entire councils, voting for cabinets (sometimes extending to electing or approving \nspecific individuals for each portfolio)). This situation is made even more unclear by the \ngrowing number of authorities where no one party has an overall majority. It is unsurprising \ntherefore, that many of those to whom we spoke recognised that there is a process of \ndiscussion and negotiation in choosing cabinet members and in the allocation of portfolios. \nHowever, the majority of respondents, both female and male, from all parties and across \ndifferent types of councils, felt that there was no hierarchy of portfolios (\u201ewith the previous \nleader there was. This mirrored the old [committee system] council\u201f (female, Conservative); \n\u201eI have tried to balance portfolio responsibilities\u201f (male, Labour), and where such a thing was \nidentified, it was often seen as being because a particular post was held by a deputy leader, or \nfor specific local reasons, such as that roads or education were currently a high profile issue in \nthe area. The fact that women are more likely to hold responsibilities in some policy areas \ndoes not therefore appear to reflect any difference in status or power across cabinets, certainly \nas measured by councillors themselves. This is arguably different from the situation prior to \n\u201emodernisation\u201f, where the chairs of some committees, frequently those most likely to be \nchaired by men, were generally seen as having greater power and influence than others.  \n \nThere were also two other findings that might potentially relate to debates about women and \nsubstantive representation, and in particular to the extent that women (seek to) represent \nwomen. Firstly, women were no more likely than men to report that they had experience with \ncommunity issues and community groups before entering politics, a finding that fits well with \nthe literature that suggests that women are more likely to become involved in politics via \nmechanisms outside the political mainstream. Secondly, however, women were significantly \nmore likely than their male counterparts to report that they had other political commitments, \nalthough in this instance these were frequently directly related to their local government role, \nrather than to involvement in other groups or organisations that might have been expected to \nact as mechanisms for links with other women. \n \nThe information gleaned from the interviews is again somewhat contradictory in relation to \ndebates and evidence on gendered political leadership, and in particular the view that women \npoliticians operate differently from men. Although, as noted earlier, women were likely to say \nthat they do adopt different approaches from men, when asked specifically about their \nleadership styles, the majority of respondents, female and male, suggested that they \u201eseek to \nbe inclusive\u201f (Labour, male), are \u201eless confrontational and more consensual\u201f (female, \nConservative) and \u201einformal and participative\u201f (male, Conservative), although some still \nemphasised that they are \u201ewilling to have conflict and make tough decisions\u201f (female, \nConservative). After \u201einclusiveness\u201f, the most commonly used phrases were \u201econsensual\u201f and \n\u201etransparent\u201f; many respondents argued that they wished to have more transparent decision \nmaking, frequently citing their predecessors as not having had this, but several also stressed \nthat they were \u201ewilling to make tough decisions\u201f. Perhaps unsurprisingly they identified skills \nsuch as strategic thinking, networking, communication, \u201emanagerial\u201f and IT skills as \nimportant for council leaders. Overall there was little difference in responses between men \nand women, with both being far more likely to say that they were inclusive than any other \nresponse, and with women being just as likely as men to say that they were willing to make \ntough decisions (although it was only women who identified transparency as one of their \ntraits).  \n \nConclusions \nIn terms of the descriptive representation of women, the results presented in the first section \nof analysis in this article provide a comprehensive picture of the position in 2006. On the face \nof it, the reforms that the Labour governments have introduced since 1997, particularly in \nEngland and Wales, appear to have made relatively little difference, with trends such as the \ngradual increase in the number of women councillors continuing, and a continued closing of \nthe gender gap in relation to senior posts, such as portfolio holders in cabinets, although the \nnumbers of women reaching the position of leader or deputy leader of councils remains lower \nthan would be expected in relation to the numbers of women who are elected to local \nauthorities. \n \nDespite their under-representation amongst council leaders, it does not appear likely that \nwomen are losing out more than previously as a result of the increased concentration of power \namong the small groups that form the cabinets, particularly in England and Wales, compared \nwith the larger committees under the previous structures. This is because the relative under-\nrepresentation of women in the positions of council leader (and deputy leader, where such a \nposition exists) does not appear to be reflected in the make-up of cabinets which, on average, \nnow roughly reflect the proportions of female and male councillors, again a change from the \nposition in 2000\/2001. This almost inevitably leads to the question of whether and when the \nproportion of council leaders who are women will come to reflect the proportion of cabinet \nmembers who are women, as might be expected from perspectives such as that of the lag \nhypothesis. However, perhaps more immediately of interest are the differences in portfolio \nresponsibilities, and in particular the extent to which women councillors are proportionately \nmore likely to oversee certain areas, such as social services, housing, health and community \nor neighbourhood services, and are much less likely to have lead roles in others, such as \ntransport and regeneration\/economic development. The ways in which these portfolios are \nallocated are an important area for further examination, clearly in relation to gender, but also \nto other factors such as party, and the relationships between leaders and the members of \ncabinets. Similarly, the apparent relationship between women leaders and the proportion of \nwomen in cabinets is also worthy of exploration \u2013 do women leaders choose to have more \nwomen in their cabinets, or are there other influences at work, such as perhaps the presence of \npolitically powerful women making it more likely that a women will become leader? The \ngreater proportionality of numbers of men and women in cabinets in relation to male and \nfemale councillors has also been reflected in the chairing of scrutiny committees, although the \ngender differences in areas of responsibility are also evident in these roles, and the reasons for \nthis are again unclear. A significant question may again be the extent to which female and \nmale councillors exercise choice over which scrutiny committees they chair. As noted above, \nthere is a literature, including that around critical actors, which suggests that some \nrepresentatives may be much more motivated than others to pursue women-friendly policies. \n\u201ePresence\u201f in positions of responsibility in the right policy areas would be likely to be one \nmeans of doing this, and this research suggests that local government would provide a fruitful \nground for further work in this field. \n \nHowever, on the extent to which women in leadership positions in local government seek to \nrepresent women, the evidence from this research is mixed. Women in such positions in local \nauthorities do appear to be more likely than their male counterparts to support descriptive \nrepresentation (although they are not necessarily more enthusiastic about particular \nmechanisms to achieve this), and are more likely to argue that in politics women operate \ndifferently from men. While there is clear evidence that they are more likely to hold \nleadership positions in areas which might traditionally have been seen as relating to \u201ewomen\u201fs \ninterests\u201f; it is here that the evidence becomes more confused, since, as noted above, the \nextent to which individuals are exercising choice over these roles is unclear. This is another \narea worthy of further exploration in the future, as it has significant implications for debates \nabout the substantive representation of women, since it may be possible to consider the extent \nto which individuals are seeking to act (or not) for the substantive representation of women \nand the policy arenas in which they do so.  \n \nYet, few respondents, male or female, agreed with the proposition that women are more likely \nto hold different perspectives on policy areas, and there was relatively little suggestion that \nwomen are more likely to voice women\u201fs concerns or prioritise particular interests or policy \nareas (areas where the evidence from the parliamentary level is mixed). One possible \ninterpretation of these results might therefore be that senior women councillors are more \nlikely to favour descriptive representation, perhaps on the grounds of justice or legitimacy, \nbut that they do not expect (or possibly wish for) particular policy responses or greater or \ndifferent substantive representation to result from this? However, it may be that the answer to \nwhether there is any fostering of the substantive representation of women depends upon the \ninterpretation of findings such as the distribution of portfolios and areas of responsibility \nbetween men women, an area which remains very unclear, and the policy outcomes that arise \nfrom these.  \n \nFinally when asked about their leadership styles, both men and women councillors tended to \nuse similar language and arguments, with, from their point of view, any perceived contrast \ntypically being with their predecessors, rather than with the other sex. The research therefore \nfinds relatively little direct support for the idea of gendered political leadership, although the \nkey fact remains that at the most senior levels in elected local government, women remain \nunderrepresented, even in relation to the proportion of councillors who are female. \n \n Funding \n \nNuffield Foundation Small Grants Scheme (SGS\/32112). \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1\n Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Vibrant Local Leadership, ODPM, 2005. \n2\n Department for Communities and Local Government, Strong and Prosperous Communities, The \nStationery Pffice, 2006. \n3\n Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Vibrant Local Leadership, ODPM, 2005. \n4\n Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Equality and Diversity in Local Government in England: A \nLiterature Review, ODPM, 2003. \n5\n Department for Communities and Local Government, Strong and Prosperous Communities, The \nStationery Office, 2006. \n6\n D.
