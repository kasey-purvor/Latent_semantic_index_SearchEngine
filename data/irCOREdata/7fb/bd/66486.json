Resonant soft x-ray scattering of 3d transition metal oxides is the only technique for\nthe atomic selective measurement of spin, charge, and orbital correlations in materials, such as high\ntemperature superconductors, colossal magnetoresistance manganites, and charge stripe nickelates.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevLett.90.187201 PACS numbers: 75.25.+z, 61.10.\u2013i, 71.30.+h, 75.47.Lx\nX-ray diffraction is a mature technique for studying\nthe crystallographic structure of materials. With the\nadvent of high intensity synchrotron radiation, the tech-\nnique has broadened to take advantage of the polariza-\ntion, time structure, low divergence, and coherence. The\nenergy of the monochromatic x-ray beam can be changed\nto alter the penetration and scattering, particularly close\nto element absorption edges giving atomic selectivity.\nThe use of soft x-ray energies in single crystal diffrac-\ntion experiments has received little attention due to the\nperception that the absorption by the sample is far too\nhigh. Certainly, x rays at such energies are extremely\ninconvenient to work with. First, air absorption at such\nenergies is severe; the experiment (sample, diffractome-\nter, etc.) must be placed in vacuum. Second, soft x rays\nhave prohibitively long wavelengths, which means that\nthe Ewald sphere is very small and only a very small\nvolume of reciprocal space around the origin is accessible.\nIt is for these reasons that it has been widely believed that\nsoft x rays are inappropriate for diffraction experiments.\nAs a result, there have been no reported experiments of\ndiffraction from single crystals using soft x rays. For this,\nthe first attempt at soft x-ray diffraction, we chose to\nstudy the bilayer manganite La2\u00012xSr1\u00022xMn2O7 [1]. This\nmaterial crystallizes in a layered structure, as shown in\nFig. 1, and has unit cell parameters of 3:87\u0004 3:87\u0004\n20:1 \u0011A. The c axis is sufficiently long to allow us to access\nthe (002) Bragg reflection, even at soft x-ray energies.\nWe find that the diffraction intensity varies strongly with\nincident x-ray energy when scanned through the LIII and\nLII absorption edges, and we observe diffraction from the\nmagnetic ordering via a dramatic resonant enhancement\nat the LII and LIII edges. Our results demonstrate that\nresonant magnetic diffraction can be extended to the 3d\ntransition metals and that this technique provides a direct\nprobe of the 3d orbitals of charge, spin, and orbitally or-\ndered oxides such as manganites, cuprates, and nickelates.\nThe experiments were conducted on station 5U1 at the\nSynchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) at Daresbury\nLaboratory.

A\n300 \u0007m post grating exit slit was used resulting in an\nenergy resolution of \u0014E \u0003 1 eV at 640 eV. The incident\nx rays were approximately 90% linearly \t polarized with\nan incident flux of the order 1011 photons s\u00011. The two-\ncircle diffractometer [2] is in a high vacuum vessel to\neliminate air absorption, and a variable temperature stage\nusing liquid nitrogen is located on the sample (\n) axis.\nThe diffractometer was operated with a base pressure in\nthe region 10\u00016 to 10\u00017 torr with the theta and two theta\naxes both having a mechanical resolution of 0:0005\u0005. A\n300 \u0007m slit was placed in front of the detector to in-\ncrease the experimental resolution, resulting in an angu-\nlar resolution of 0:1\u0005. The scattered photon flux was\nestimated from calibration of the drain current of the\nphotodiode detector. Typically, data was collected with\nan average measurement time of 1\u20135 s per datum.\nThe crystal of La2\u00012xSr1\u00022xMn2O7 with x \u0003 0:475 was\ngrown by the floating-zone method with dimensions of\n8\u0004 8\u0004 1 mm. These samples naturally cleave with large\nfaces with [001] surface normal, and it was this untreated\nsurface that was used. The sample was aligned in the\ndiffractometer with the [001] and [110] defining the dif-\nfraction plane, giving an azimuthal orientation with the\n[110] direction being perpendicular to the incident\nx-ray electric field vector. Initially, experiments were\ncarried out in the nonresonant condition at a photon\nenergy of 900 eV. The inset of Fig. 2 shows a scan through\nthe Bragg (002) diffraction reflection in the [001] direc-\ntion. At 900 eV, the \n angle of approximately 44\u0005 that is\nrequired to satisfy the Bragg condition is easily acces-\nsible. By measuring the peak width in the [001] direction\n(i.e., parallel to the scattering vector), it is possible to\nmeasure the crystal truncation rod, the broadening in\nreciprocal space due to the finite depth penetration of\nthe incident x-ray beam. Performing such a calculation,\nwe find the inverse correlation length [defined as \u000b\u00011 \u0003\n2\f\nc \r, where \r is the half width at half maximum in\nreciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.) and c is the direct space\nlattice parameter] to be 2:273\u0004 10\u00013 \u0011A\u00011. This is ap-\nproximately half that of the inverse correlation length\nmeasured by us on the same crystal at a photon energy of\n12.4 keV and is comparable with the absorption attenu-\nation length, \u0007\u00011. This demonstrates that the soft x rays\nare penetrating through many unit cells of the single\ncrystal and that the technique is not particularly surface\nsensitive.\nIn the next part of the experiment, we recorded the\n(002) Bragg peak intensity as a function of the incident\nx-ray energy. Close to absorption edges the real and\nimaginary scattering factors are radically altered, giv-\ning increased absorption, and also increased scattering.\nFigure 2 shows the intensity of the (002) Bragg reflec-\ntion as a function of energy close to the LIII and LII\nMn-absorption edges. Dramatic enhancement of the dif-\nfraction intensity is observed at \u0006640 and \u0006655 eV,\nwhile there was no observed change in the background\nof the Bragg peak on resonance. These enhancements\nare so large that potentially extremely weak charge scat-\ntering, unobservable at off-resonant energies, could be-\ncome easily observable via the resonant enhancement\neffect.\nThese charge scattering measurements already extend\nthe range of possibilities of x-ray diffraction in the study\nof crystal structures, but the really exciting prospect is\nthe use of such resonances in the study of magnetic\nstructures. The use of x-ray scattering to probe the mag-\nnetic structure of crystalline solids started over 25 years\nago with the study of NiO by de Bergevin and Brunel [3].\nHowever, such scattering is an extremely weak phenome-\nnon, typically 108 times weaker than charge reflections,\nwith the result that most magnetic structure determina-\ntion has employed neutron diffraction. During the past\n15 years, enormous strides have been made in magnetic\nx-ray scattering using highly intense synchrotron\nsources. Huge increases in the magnetic cross section of\nx-ray scattering have been obtained by tuning the x-ray\nenergy near to the absorption edge of the material [4\u20136].\nThese resonant enhancements can be so large that reso-\nnant magnetic scattering can be employed in the study of\nthin films and even surface layers. Furthermore, in the\nresonant regime close to an absorption edge there are\nother terms that contribute to the total scattering. For\nan x ray promoting an inner shell electron to an unoccu-\npied outer level, the amplitude for resonant magnetic\nscattering depends upon the matrix elements that couple\nthe ground and excited states. This means that the energy\nand polarization dependence of the magnetic scattering\nprobes the fine structure of the magnetic states.\nFIG. 2 (color online).

Such edges are convenient to work with, as\nthe effects of air and sample absorption are not so severe.\nFor example, experiments on the spiral magnetic struc-\nture of holmium at the L edges found a fiftyfold reso-\nnant enhancement of the diffraction [4,5]. At the M\nedge even larger effects have been observed, e.g., in\nuranium arsenide (UAs) an enhancement of 7 orders of\nmagnitude was observed at the MIV edge (3.7 keV) and 5\norders of magnitude at the MV edge [6]. Until now, the\nhighest resonant enhancement obtained was discovered\nin UAs where the magnetic scattering signal was found to\nbe 1% of the charge scattering.\nTo date, it has not been possible to exploit fully reso-\nnant magnetic diffraction to study 3d transition metal\ncompounds, the largest class of magnetic materials in\ntechnological applications and fundamental research.\nThis is because 3d ions contain no strong resonances in\nthe hard x-ray region. Scattering at the K edge resonances\nof 3d ions has been observed [7,8], but the enhancement is\nsmall (factor of 3\u20135) because the transition probed is the\n1s\u0001 4p while the spins responsible for the magnetic\nordering belong to the 3d band. To study magnetism in\ntransition metal compounds directly, one needs to access\nthe LIII and LII edges, which exist in the region 500\u2013\n900 eV. However, the value of utilizing soft x-ray reso-\nnance experiments has been demonstrated by related\nexperiments on thin films which have employed resonant\nsoft x rays to probe the magnetic alignment of coupled\nlayers in metallic multilayers [9] and magnetic stripe\ndomain structures in FePd alloys [10]. Other studies\nhave used soft x-ray absorption edges for x-ray magnetic\ncircular dichroism [11]. Very recently soft x-ray resonant\nscattering on thin films of La2\u0001xSrxCuO4 at the oxygen\nK edge has been observed giving information on the\ncarriers [12].\nLa2\u00012xSr1\u00022xMn2O7 (x \u0003 0:475) undergoes a transition\ninto a charge and orbitally ordered state at 220 K followed\nby a transition into an A type antiferromagnetic (AFM)\nstructure at 180 K. The magnetic structure has been\npreviously determined by neutron scattering experiments\n[13,14]. The right side of Fig. 1 shows the magnetic\nstructure which is ferromagnetic in the a-b plane but\nantiferromagnetic along the c axis previously solved by\nneutron scattering techniques [15]. Therefore below 180 K\na magnetic diffraction peak due to the AFM structure\nshould occur at the (001) position, even though the (001)\nBragg reflection is systematically absent because of the\ncrystal symmetry.\nThe sample was cooled down to 83 K and the incident\nx-ray energy tuned to the LI absorption edge (769 eV). No\nresonance of the AFM (001) at this energy was observed.\nThe incident photon energy was set to 639 eVcorrespond-\ning to the LIII absorption edge. Such an edge causes a\ndipole transition from the 2p3=2 to 3d levels directly\nprobing the split electronic structure due to the magne-\ntism. Appreciable intensity of the (001) was found at this\nwave vector, and a scan is shown as the inset of Fig. 3. A\nscan of incident photon energy verses the integrated in-\ntensity of the (001) diffraction was measured. The result,\nshown in Fig. 3, indicates two noticeable peaks showing\nan extremely large resonant enhancement at the LIII edge.\nIn addition, magnetic diffraction was also observed at the\nLII edge. Away from the LII and LIII resonances, the\nmagnetic peak was unobservable due to its very low\nintensity. Such a large resonant enhancement has been\npredicted qualitatively [16]. The different spectral shape\nobserved in this resonance as opposed to that of the Bragg\npeak is most probably due to the electronic structure of\nthe 3d band being split due to the effects of Jahn-Teller\ndistortions of the Mn octahedra and the structure factor\nof the (001) being only sensitive to the Mn ions. To\nconfirm the origin of the reflection, the sample was\nwarmed to 300 K, past the Ne\u00b4el temperature of 180 K\nand the energy scan repeated. No resonance was found at\nhigh temperature. Measuring the inverse correlation\nlength of the (001) reflection in the [001] direction gives\na value of 5:31\u0004 10\u00013 \u0011A\u00011, twice that of the (002) Bragg\npeak off resonance. This increase is most likely due to the\nincrease in absorption at the edge.\nWe measured the integrated intensity of the AFM (001)\npeak as a function of temperature upon warming. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 4. The sample displays charge\nordering below 220 K resulting in additional charge\nsupercell reflections at a wave vector of ( 12 , 12 , 0).\nSeparately, we have measured the charge ordering satel-\nlite intensity as a function of temperature [17] using\nFIG. 3 (color online). An energy scan at fixed wave vector\nthrough the (001) antiferromagnetic ordering reflection at 83 K.\nThe inset shows a scan through the same peak in the \u000700l\b\ndirection, with the solid line being a Lorentzian fit to the\nexperimental data (open circles).\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending9 MAY 2003VOLUME 90, NUMBER 18\n187201-3 187201-3\nnonresonant high-energy x-ray diffraction at beam line\nBW5 at HASYLAB, Germany [18]. Here the same sample\nwas mounted on a four-circle diffractometer with an\nincident photon energy of 94.8 keV. As found by others\n[15], the charge ordering reaches a maximum at 180 K\nbefore reducing in intensity and disappearing below\n120 K. In Fig. 4, we can see that the onset of the AFM\nordering at 180 K exactly coincides with the maximum\nintensity of the charge ordering. It is the onset of the\nferromagnetic order in the a-b plane that causes a collapse\nof the charge order.\nOur results demonstrate the unique features of resonant\nmagnetic diffraction as a probe of the magnetic state of a\nmaterial. By tuning to the different edges, it is possible to\nprovide elemental specific measurements, separating the\nspin and orbital components on each chemical species.\nSecond, the absorption edge, and thus the energy of the\ncore-electron transitions, is dependent on the valence\nstate of the ion. Therefore the resonant energy of the\nmagnetic transition is dependent on the valence state.\nResonant magnetic x-ray scattering is the only technique\nwhich provides this degree of both element and valence\nstate specificity. These new results obtained using soft\nx rays show that we are in a new regime where resonant\nmagnetic scattering is substantially larger than nonreso-\nnant change scattering. In a future paper, we will dem-\nonstrate the use of soft x rays to probe orbital correlations.\nResonant soft x-ray diffraction at the L edges of 3d\ntransition metal oxides is the only technique for the\ndirect observation of spin, charge, and orbital correla-\ntions in strongly correlated electron systems. Soft x-ray\nresonant techniques may be used to study layered cup-\nrates such as La2\u0001xSrxCuO4 (with periods greater than\n6:6 \u0011A) which display charge and spin ordering. This work\nhas shown that soft x-ray diffraction will become an\nexciting technique in the future for the study of magne-\ntism in 3d materials with extensions to systems such as\ncopper based high temperature cuprate superconductors,\ncolossal magnetoresistance manganites, and charge\nstriped nickelates.\nWe gratefully acknowledge experimental support and\ndiscussions with P.
