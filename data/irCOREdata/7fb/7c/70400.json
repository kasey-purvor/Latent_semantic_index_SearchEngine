The integration of digital components \ninto clothing is becoming an increasingly important \nsegment in wearable computing research. The first \nindications for this trend are the incorporation of \nexisting mobile technologies, such as personal \ndigital assistants (PDAs) or mobile phones, into \njackets via flexible textile circuits. In the long term, \nother components could also be envisioned that \nare embedded in apparel, using a flexible bus-type \nnetwork that links all the devices together. This \npaper introduces a functioning prototype of such a \nflexible network that not only allows communication \nbetween wearable components, but is also able to \nsupply power to them. We propose an \narrangement of layered textiles as opposed to the \nmore traditional routed circuitry layout, which \nresults in a novel approach towards the concept of \na flexible clothing network. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nProgress in coating and weaving techniques has \nenabled industry and research to produce durable \nthreads and textiles that are highly conductive and \nas flexible as regular fabric. Research at MIT (5), \nFrance Telecom (6), Foster-Miller (3), Reima \nSmart Clothing (12) and Philips (2,4) has produced \nproducts that use this conductive textile to network \nthe wearer\u2019s mobile devices (such as an MP3 \nplayer or a mobile phone). As these devices get \nsmaller in size and larger in variety, it is plausible \nthat the importance of this flexible clothing network \nwill increase.  \n \nThe routing of power and communication paths in \nclothing is commonly achieved by weaving a \nnumber of conductive threads along predefined \nseams, similar in structure to how peripheral \ndevices are connected to a personal computer. \nThe locations where these wearable devices can \nbe stored are therefore limited to the area around \nthese routes, assuming these are fixed in the \nclothing. Using this integrated routed approach can \ntherefore become more awkward in applications \nwhere the accurate location of these devices is \nessential. \n \nResearch in wearable sensor networks in \nparticular, requires the interconnection of a large \nnumber of sensor devices that can be worn at \ncertain places on the body. Experiments on \nprototypes with conventional cables have proven \nto be inferior, as they hinder the wearer\u2019s \nmovements and tend to put a lot of strain on the \nconnectors. The sheer weight of the cabling, as \nwell as the space that they require, rapidly \nincreases as more sensors are added to the \nclothing network.  \n \nThis paper will present a structural design method \nfor the physical integration of network connections \nin clothing, which is different from traditional \ntechniques. After an overview of how the network \nfunctions and what its components are, a toy \nproblem illustrates the implementation, benefits \nand prospects of this type of networking in \nwearable computing. This is followed by a \ndiscussion on the approach\u2019s limitations and \napplication potential.  \n \n \nA LAYERED DESIGN \n \nThis paper focuses on the use of layers instead of \nroutes, to carry data and power over clothing. This \nexpands the network over flexible two-dimensional \nplanes rather than wires, and results in the \ndistribution of the network over the entire surface \nof the garment. Moreover, using conducting layers \nalso does away with the need for fixed routing. \n \n \nFigure 1. Pictures of the proposed layered textile \nnetwork, where two conductive layers are separated by \na rubber layer, and a wearable device. The network \nconnection is made by attaching the device like a lapel \npin.  \nTo characterize this approach, an example is given \nspecifying the network bus protocol, the physical \narrangement of the layers, and the method of \nconnecting the networked devices to the separate \nlayers. \n \n \nThe Network Protocol \n \nThe protocol that has been adopted in this paper is \nresponsible for providing both a communication \nnetwork and power to any device that gets \nconnected. The Dallas MicroLAN (7) is a protocol \nstandard that needs two connections to network \nand power devices: one for ground, and one for \nthe communication bus\u2019 signal. The latter signal is \nfurthermore pulled to a high state most of the time, \nso that the attached devices are able to \u2018steal\u2019 \npower from that same communications bus.  \n \nThe traffic on the bus network is controlled on a \nmaster-slave principle, where one node controls all \nmessages from the other nodes, dubbed slaves or \nclients. The complexity of this master node \ndepends on the specific network application, but \ncan be implemented in embedded devices.   \n  \n \nThe Physical Network Materials \n \nThe conductive textile that was used in this paper \nconsists of woven threads of nylon that have been \ncoated with silver (AG) to give it conductive \nproperties. The layers of this fabric are insulated by \nflexible sheets of rubber that is available with \nadhesive sides that make it easier to secure to the \nconductive layers. These two materials are widely \navailable, relatively low-cost, and robust enough to \nbe used in clothing.  \n \nThe silver-coated fabric was chosen for its high \nconductivity (0.5 Ohms per square), but other \ncoatings are possible as well (such as Copper) (8). \nAlternatively, one can also use actual fibers of \nconductive alloys rather than coating that are then \nused in a woven or knitted fabric (1). Both types of \nfabrics (using coated nylon or metal fibers) are \ngenerally used in radio frequency shielding and \nanti-static applications. \n \n \nCASE STUDY: TEMPERATURE LOGGING \n \nThe case study in this paper uses the network \ndescribed in the previous section to solve a model \nproblem of a wearable sensor network: Consider \nthat one would like to know the temperature \ndistribution over the entire area of a piece of \nclothing while it is being worn, over a certain period \n(covering hours, days, or possibly even months). \nConsider also certain additional restrictions on the \nsystem: \n \n\u2022 For increasing its robustness, there might \nbe the need to log the temperature data \nlocally in the sensor modules themselves.  \n \n\u2022 There is furthermore a need for flexibility in \nthe network: it should be straightforward to \nadd, reposition, or replace sensors at any \ntime. \n \n \nThe Sensor Modules   \n \nHaving described the network, both physically and \nin software protocol in the previous section, the \nonly remaining component that needs to be \nspecified is the sensor module that carries out the \nmeasuring and logging of the temperatures. We \nuse for this purpose the DS1921H iButton device, \nor Termochron (9), which also interoperates with \nthe MicroLAN network communication standard (as \nall iButton devices do).  \n \nThe Termochron records both time and \ntemperature, it's embedded computer chip \nintegrates a MicroLAN transmitter\/receiver, a \nglobally unique address, a high resolution \nthermometer, a clock\/calendar, a thermal history \nlog, and 512 bytes of additional memory to store \nadditional data. It comes also integrated with a 3V \nbattery that keeps its logging process running for \nmore than 10 years, for temperatures from 15\u00b0C to \n46\u00b0C, with a \u00b10.125\u00b0C accuracy. Each iButton also \nhas an ID number that is unique in the world, \nformed by 64 bits or 8 bytes. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Screenshot of the OneWireViewer utility that \ncomes with MicroLAN parts. The IDs of the devices \npresent on the bus network are listed on the left, while \ndevice specific information (such as the logged \ntemperatures for the Thermochron) is displayed on the \nright.  \n \nAs mentioned in the protocol section, MicroLAN \ndevices typically communicate with a bus master \ncontroller. Adaptors are available that convert the \nsignals from the MicroLAN to serial RS232 levels \nso that the network can be \u2018inspected\u2019 by software \non a PC, as Figure 2 illustrates. \n \n \nThe Connection \n \nThe temperature loggers still need to be capable of \nad-hoc connection to the physical network. For this \nreason, the temperature logging iButtons are fitted \nwith two pins: one short pin that connects to the \nclosest layer, and one partly-insulated longer one \nthat connects to the second layer. In this fashion, \nall \u2018pinned\u2019 modules access the same two layers \nthat provide the network connections (see Figure 3 \nfor a diagram).  \n \nBased upon earlier work from the Pin&Play (10,11) \nproject that uses similar hardware and materials for \ncreating wall-sized networks, we arrive at a \nflexible, textile-based network, connecting small \ndevices that do distributed sensing.   \n \nUsing these pin connectors, the small temperature \nmodules can thus be seen as an electronic \nenhancement of lapel pins that traditionally get \nattached to lapels or ties. Typically, these pins \ncome with a clip to protect the wearer from the \nsharp pin (Figure 3 provides a photograph of an \nexample of a decorative lapel pin).  \n \n \n  \n \nFigure 3. Schematic of the network (top), a photograph \nof an ordinary lapel pin (bottom left), and this paper\u2019s \nimplemented prototype pin and network (bottom right). \nTemperature logging modules can thus be added and \nreplaced on the fabric, similar to lapel pins. These \naugmented pins however contain an additional \ntemperature sensor, data logger, and MicroLAN \ncommunication capabilities.  \n \n \nEXPERIMENT \n \nThis section aims to demonstrate the feasibility of \nusing the prototype hardware discussed in the \nprevious sections, in particular for the introduced \nwearable sensing problem. A further goal is to \ncharacterize the performance of the proposed \nnetwork using this example.  \n \nAs temperature logging is completely the \nresponsibility of the Thermochron iButtons, the \nsoftware for this application that runs on the master \ncomes into action after all the data has been \nstored. All components use their own internal \nbattery power while the experimental garment is \nworn, and no communication between nodes is \nnecessary. The network master (a standard \ndesktop PC in this experiment) therefore does not \nhave to be connected until after the trial-period, \nwhen all the devices need to deliver their logged \ntemperature data.  \n \nThe advantage of using the layered approach to \ngarment construction in this case study is the \nflexibility of location of the sensing devices on the \njacket. Should the experimenters want to redo the \ntrial with additional sensors, or sensors on other \nlocations, all that needs to be done is to simply \nattach or re-attach the devices, respectively. No \nnew wires need to be rerouted in the jacket, and \nno changes in software or hardware are required.  \nThe network protocol used (MicroLAN) comes from \na traditional wired bus standard. Our layered \nnetwork variation therefore does not provide the \nlocation where on the body a device is located, so \nthis information has to be assigned by hand. Once \nthis is done, however, all other information (mainly \nconsisting out of time-temperature data tupels) is \ndownloaded and visualized instantaneously.  \n \nResults \nIn our experiments, the jacket was connected to a \ncomputer as soon as the trial phase was over (i.e., \nafter sufficient temperatures had been logged), \nwith the trial simply involving the jacket being worn \nfor about 20 minutes (without the wearer doing \nanything) as a sanity check using the effects of \nbody-heat. The only user-interaction that is \nrequired on the computer side at that point, is to \ninput the positions of all temperature loggers. It \nwould also have been feasible to connect a \nwearable computer to the jacket while the data \nlogging was going on. However, the jacket is still in \nan early prototypical stage, which was the main \nreason for adopting this two-step process.  \n \nte\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n \nm\nod\nul\ne \ntop sheet \n \nbottom sheet \nTo access the data from the temperature loggers, \ntwo types of response-times are of interest from an \napplication-oriented perspective: the time to detect \nall devices is important for the responsiveness of \nthe software, while the time to transmit the logged \ndata is important for future applications (that might \nask continuously for sensor data from all sensor \nmodules across the clothing network, for instance).    \n \nThe MicroLAN has in its protocol a built-in reset-\npresence-pulse procedure that was designed to \nquickly detect and identify all devices on the \nnetwork. This explains the relatively high rates we \nmeasured between opening the network \nconnection (between master and slaves), and the \nmaster having recorded all identities of the slaves. \nTable 1\u2019s \u2018Time To Read\u2019 column shows our \napplication\u2019s response times, being the actual time \nthe user has to wait between a query and the \nnetwork\u2019s reply (including visualization, etc.). \nThese figures show clearly the negative effects of \nthe MicroLAN\u2019s low bandwidth, which for some \napplications would be unacceptable.   \n \n \nTABLE 1 \u2013 The Experiment\u2019s Time Measurements \n# devices Time To Detect \n(ms*) \nTime To Read \n(ms*) \n2 74 5200 \n4 149 5600 \n6 224 6100 \n8 298 6600 \n10 368 6800 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Figure 5 \nshows the prototype jacket\u2019s inner layer, containing \nseveral temperature logging devices, attached to a \ncomputer for analysis. \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Picture of the prototype jacket\u2019s inside layer. \n \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n \nRestrictions \n \nThere are many reasons why the MicroLAN was \nchosen as a network protocol, with simplicity as the \ndominant factor. Since it needs only two channels, \ntwo insulated layers of conductive textile are \nsufficient, and the devices need only two pins to \nconnect to those layers. But the MicroLAN comes \nalso with some limitations: bandwidth is, at best, \n16300 bits per second, and the network structure is \nlimited to a master - slave architecture. This is \nsufficient for applications exchanging control \npackets, or short transmissions of data, but it \nwould be incapable in its current form of supporting \nstreams of video or sound.  \n \nA more physical disadvantage is the restriction on \nconductive pins: most normal lapel pins are fully \nconductive, so pinning them in the fabric layers \nwould result in shorting the network. Both \nhardware and software can handle this kind of \nfailure, but neither power nor communication will \nbe available to the networked devices. \n \nFinally, the layers of conductive fabric may \ninterfere with wireless protocols operating in its \nvicinity. Initial tests with prototypes from the \nPin&Play project, however, indicate that the \nshielding effect is minimal as long as the wireless \nmodules are not completely enclosed by the \nconductive layers (such as in a pocket). It is thus \npossible to use both layered and wireless \napproaches concurrently, given extra care is taken \nin positioning the antennae. \n \n \nLayered vs. Wireless \n \nThis paper proposes not only an alternative to \nrouted networking in clothing; it obviously could \nalso be an alternative to wireless networks. This \nsection discusses possible reasons why certain \napplications might benefit from this paper\u2019s layered \napproach. \n \nPower. Mobile and wearable computing devices \nare generally restricted in size and weight, which \noften leads to tough design choices on the \nbatteries. Maintaining a wireless communication \nchannel requires an additional amount of battery \npower, causing problems in the devices\u2019 design \nphase. \n \nSize \/ Weight. Another prominent requirement for \nwearable computers is that their size and weight \nshould not obstruct the wearer. The size of the pin-\nbased devices is generally smaller, since they only \nneed power to keep them working when they are \ndetached from the network. They also do not \nrequire antennas or additional communication \nmodules. \n \nNetwork Range. Although some wearable devices \nmay require connections with services in the \nsurroundings of the wearer, most wearable devices \nfor the same person have direct contact with his or \nher clothing. The network\u2019s signal strength and \nquality is also expected to remain the same.  \n \nTransparency of Network Topology. It is \nincreasingly difficult to keep track of what devices \nare attached to one\u2019s network if it is wireless. The \nfact that devices have to be explicitly attached to \nthe wearer\u2019s apparel in our proposed layered \napproach, makes it easier to get a prompt \noverview: Devices attached to the clothing, are \nattached to the network. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nWe proposed a new approach to integrate a \nphysical network in clothing, using layers of \nconductive textile to bring power and \ncommunication capabilities to every square inch of \nthe clothing\u2019s surface. Mobile and wearable \ndevices can be attached to the fabric by pins that \nconnect to each layer, thus giving the devices \naccess to the clothing\u2019s power and communication \nnetwork.  \n \nAn application where a network is required to \nreach the clothing\u2019s entire surface was provided as \na case study. It illustrated that the network can \nhandle ad-hoc connections of many devices that \nwere distributed over the clothing. The current \nprototype has, due to the chosen protocol, a low \nbandwidth as the key disadvantage. This, together \nwith the more fundamental limitation that normal \nconductive lapel pins would disable the network, \nand an insight in health implications for this \nmethodology, remain open issues. \nThe main advantage of spreading a network \nconnection over the full surface of clothing is \nmodularity: wearable devices are not required to \nhave a fixed location or orientation on the clothing; \nthey can be pinned and re-pinned at will, just like \ntheir traditional counterparts. Our case study \nshowed that this property could be useful in \nspecific areas such as wearable sensor research. \nThe clothing-as-a-network paradigm has in our \nview potential beyond this domain, especially in \nlonger-term wearable computing research.  \n  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThis research was in part funded by the European \nCommission\u2019s IST FET framework, under contract \ncode IST-2001-37007 (under project name: \nPin&Play), and by Equator, an EPSRC funded IRC \nproject (GR\/N15986\/01 - \"Technological Innovation \nin Physical and Digital Life\"), as well as the \nEPSRC CommonSense project, under grant \nGR\/S08848\/01 (\"Multi-Sensor Perceptive \nInterfaces in Wearable and Ubiquitous \nComputing\").  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
