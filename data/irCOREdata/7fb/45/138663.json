As T.S. Eliot (1934) said: \n \n\u201cWhere is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? \nWhere is the knowledge we have lost in information?\u201d \n \nHe may not have been referring to the kind of periphrastic papers that emanate from \nbusiness schools around the world and which are largely irrelevant to and ignored by \npractising managers, but he makes a valid point which all of us need to take on board if \nwe re not to see marketing as a discipline entirely sidelined in the real world of \ncommerce.  (Davis and Brady, 1993 and all that followed). \n \nThe purpose of this paper is to provide a brief review of the state of the marketing \ndomain and to set out an alternative model designed to put marketing back at the heart of \norganisational strategy-making. \n \nIt is deliberately written in a \u2018non double-blind-referred journal\u2019 style in the hope that \nthese views will reach a wider audience.  It is fully accepted that the art versus science, \nphenomenology versus positivism debate will continue, quite rightly, but this paper is not \nabout such grave matters.  It is intended merely to note some reflections after sixteen \nyears as a marketing practitioner and twenty six years as an academic on why, following \nthe white heat of excitement about the orgastic future of marketing in the Wills days of \nthe 1960s, (Wills, G., 1976) it has today lost its influence in the corporate world, in spite \nof all our best efforts. \n \nSo, what has gone wrong and what can be done to bring about a recovery? \n \n \nA Brief Review of the State of Marketing \n \n\u201cNow it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are \nsoon told about and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating and \neven gruesome, may make a good tale and take a deal of telling anyway\u201d \n \nThe Hobbit, JRR Tolkin, Harper-Collins Publishers, London, 1995 \n \nPerhaps there is some point to all this recent intellectual whingeing about the state of \nmarketing.  So, before suggesting a way forward, let us make a very brief review of what \nwe have achieved after over fifty years of marketing.  Let us look at the three main \nconstituent parts:-  practitioners; consultants; and academics. \n \n \nPractitioners \n \nAs for practitioners, what better place to start than with the famous Tom Peters\u2019 \u2018In \nSearch of Excellence\u2019, (1982).  According to Richard Pascale (1990), of Peters\u2019 original \nforty three excellent companies, only six were still excellent only eight years later. \n \nTable 1 shows clearly that many of Britain\u2019s best performing companies during the \ndecade up to 1990 subsequently collapsed. \n \n1.  Where a company has been top for more than 1 year, the next best company has been chosen in the\nsubsequent year    e.g.. Poly Peck was related top 1983, \u201884 and \u201885\n2.

The author has painstakingly listed over three hundred \nconsultant fads developed during the past thirty years, a small selection of which are \nlisted in Table 14. \n \n\u2022 In Search of Excellence \n\u2022 Marketing Warfare \n\u2022 One Minute Manager \n\u2022 MBWA \n\u2022 Skunk Works \n\u2022 7 Ss \n\u2022 Etc. \n \nTable 14  Fads (300) \n \n \nDuring the past ten years, many companies have sought a remedy for their declining \nfortunes by retreating into faddism, hungrily adopting one fad after another as they were \npeddled by eager consultants.  In most cases these initiatives have failed, as organisations \nhave treated them as a quick-fix bolt-on without addressing their underlying problems.  \nThe International Standards Organisation\u2019s ISO 9000 quality initiative, for example, very \nlaudable when used sensibly, has, in the main, only been a guarantee that organisations \ncan produce rubbish perfectly and consistently.  We use the word \u2018rubbish\u2019 judiciously, \nbecause there is little point in producing perfectly something that people do not buy. \n \nAnother fad has been business process re-engineering (BPR).  This has been an \noutstanding success in those companies which have used it to redesign their processes to \ncreate value for customers.  But in those organisations which have not grasped the nettle \nof customer satisfaction, it has achieved merely cosmetic productivity improvements \n(Edwards, 1997).  Yet another has been balanced scorecards.  This too, for CEOs who \nunderstand the need to balance the requirements of all the stakeholders in a company \ndelivering customer value, has been very successful.  It is a strategy used with great \nsuccess by BAA, for example, for managing its complex web of stakeholder \nrelationships.  But for those CEOs who do not understand the importance of being market \ndriven, it has proved to be just another fad. \n \nOf course all of these initiatives are fabulous and do work, but only when they are seen in \nthe context of providing superior customer value as a means of providing superior \nshareholder value.  Alas, even in those organisations committed to \u2018relationship\u2019 and \n\u2018one-to-one\u2019 marketing, too often customers remain the Cinderellas.  As Harvard \nBusiness School\u2019s Susan Fournier has pointed out (1998), rapid development of \nrelationship techniques in the USA has been accompanied by growing customer \ndissatisfaction.  The much vaulted relationship that companies were so eager to forge \nwith their customers involved not so much delighting them as abusing them, suggested \nFournier. \n \nThe problem is that companies have become so internally focused they have got carried \naway with supply-side issues and taken their eye off the customer ball.  Until \norganisations make a serious effort to lift their heads above the parapet and understand \ntheir markets and their customers better, all the great initiatives referred to above will \namount to expensive, time-consuming mistakes.  Most boards are spending too much of \ntheir valuable time on internal operational efficiency (doing things right) at the expense \nof external operational effectiveness (doing the right things). \n \nIn conclusion, whilst consultants have not surprisingly fared somewhat better than the \nmarketing practitioner community, they could hardly be adjudged to have had a big \nimpact on practice. \n \n \nAcademics \n \nFinally, of course, there is the academic community.  Table 15 lists a small selection of \nquotations from well-known academics.  Most damming of all is the last one.  At the \nAcademy of Marketing Debate in the summer of 2000, the author carefully prepared his \ndebate-winning proposal that the academic marketing community was out of touch with \nmarketing practice.  One of the facts gathered concerned the number of papers in \nmarketing academic communities which addressed the top fourteen issues of concern to \npractitioners (Wensley 2000) in the two top, five-star rated academic journals. Four per \ncent was the derisory number!  One wonders whether there is a grain of truth in the \nassertion that academics are being increasingly forced by the RAE to write for a narrow, \nesoteric audience in media which are of little relevance to the real world. \n \nO \u201cMuch research is directed at technical refinement,\nwhich produces low risk, quick win publications that are\nlargely irrelevant or incomprehensible to practitioners.\nThe voice of academics is becoming weaker\u201d  (Hugh\nWilmott of MBS)\nO Robin Wensley said that marketing academics have had\nlittle impact.\n\u201cA much wider understanding of the nature of the\ncompetitive market place is required, given that it is\nsuch a central phenomenon\u201d\nO Of ten issues, (confirmed by 3- academic papers and\nthe MSI), only 4% were addressed in the top, 5 star\nrated academic journals\n \nSource:  McDonald, M. Academy of Marketing Debate, University of Derby, 2000 \n \nTable 15  Academics \n \n \nWhilst such journals clearly have relevance to academics and whilst their role is fully \nappreciated, the influence and prestige afforded to them by the RAE is out of all \nproportion to the problems facing the global marketing community and only succeeds in \ndiverting the abundant genius in our academic community into a cul-de-sac.  \nFurthermore, the style of such pieces is also becoming increasingly dense and \nimpenetrable.  The author\u2019s spoof piece in Table 16 is a somewhat lighthearted parody of \nwhat senior academics face when reviewing certain papers for double blind refereed \njournals. \n \nIn  u n d e rta k in g  a n  in -d e p th  p e ru sa l o f  th e  e v o lu tio n a ry  in te ra c tio n  o f  th is  a c ro n n ym ic\no rg a n isa tio n a l c o m m u n ic a tio n , th e  d u a l o rie n ta tio n  fo r  th e  a n a lys is  p a rad o x ic a lly\nre q u ired  a n  u n a sh a m e d  re p o s itio n in g  o f th e  e c le c tic  c o n c e p tu a l f ra m e w o rk  a m o n g s t th e\nm u lti-d isc ip lin a ry  b o d y  o f il lu m in a tiv e  sp e c u la tio n  in  p re d o m in a n tly  sch o la rly\nb u re a u c ra tisa tio n .\nY e t, c o in c id e n ta lly , i ts  e m p iric a l c o m p le x ity  h a d  to  re m a in  re le v a n t to  th e  e so te ric\nre a litie s  o f  p o s tm o d e rn  p ro fe sso ria l in te g ra tiv e  a n te c e d e n t d e v e lo p m e n t tre n d s  a t\na p p ro p ria te ly  c o n c ep tu a lise d  a n d  o p e ra tio n a lly - im p le m e n te d  m e ta  le v e ls .\nC o n se q u e n tly , i t  w as  n e c e ssa ry  to  re v ie w  th e  in d e p e n d e n tly  fo rm u la te d  p s yc h o m e tric\ntra d itio n s  a n d  to  e m p lo y  c o n fid e n tly  th e  a rtic u la te d ly -p re s en t p h e n o m e n o lo g ic a l\nm e th o d o lo g ie s  c u rren tly  a v a ila b le  fo r  p o lys y lla b ic  p a ra d ig m  e x p lo ra tio n .

Open University Business School, Critique of a new MBA Module on Postmodern Marketing, 2001 \n \nTable 16 \n \n \nThe net impact of this sad neglect by the academic and practitioner communities is that \nmarketing as a function has been increasingly relegated away from the core strategy-\nmaking engine of organisations to become a sales support department, in charge of T-\nshirts and promotion (as evidenced by the cultural web shown in Table 10). \n \n \nFrom Tactics to Strategy \n \nSo, what can be done to begin to recover from the sorry state the marketing community \nfinds itself in? \n \nFirstly, we have to work hard to recapture the high ground \u2013 the strategy domain.  This, \nhowever, means reaching some kind of consensus about what marketing is.  Enormous \ndamage is done to our cause when the President of The Chartered Institute of Marketing \ndeclares:  \u201cMarketing isn\u2019t a function.  It is an attitude of mind\u201d (Thompson, D., 2001).  \nThere will be many amongst us who wonder how an attitude of mind can be measured, \nresearched, developed, protected, examined, etc., all of these being the avowed purpose \nof the professional body.  Add to this the hundreds of different definitions of marketing to \nbe found in books and papers on marketing and the confusion is complete.  A selection of \nthirty such definitions are to be found in McDonald 2002, most of which involve doing \nthings to customers. \n \nLet us be unequivocal about marketing.  Just like finance, or HR, or IT, it is a function, \nbut described in terms of what it actually entails, as shown in Table 17.  This is shown \ndiagrammatically in Figure 1. \n \nMarketing is a process for:\nO defining markets\nO quantifying the needs of the customer groups (segments) within these\nmarkets\nO putting together the value propositions to meet these needs,\ncommunicating these value propositions to all those people in the\norganisation responsible for delivering them and getting their buy-in to\ntheir role\nO playing an appropriate part in delivering these value propositions\n(usually only communications)\nO monitoring the value actually delivered.\nFor this process to be effective, organisations need to be consumer\/\ncustomer-driven\n \nSource:  McDonald, M. Marketing Plans: how to prepare them; how to use them, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2002 \n \nTable 17  Definition of Marketing \n \n \nFigure 1 shows a consolidated summary of the marketing process. \n \nDefine\nmarkets\/segments\nEvaluate market\nattractiveness\nand select\nPredict market\nstructure\nDefine objectives\nEstimate expected\nresults\nValue\nrequired\nValue\ndelivered\nValue\nreceived\nHow value\ndelivered\/\ncommunicated\nDefine markets & understand value\nUnderstand value\nrequired\nUnderstand\ncompetitor value\npositioning\nDefine price\/value\nproposition\nDefine marketing\nstrategies\nDetermine value proposition\nOutbound\nlogisticsOperations Service\nDesign\/implement marketing communication programmes\nDesign program Negotiate\/ tailor\nInitiate dialogue Commit\nExchange information Exchange value\nMonitor\nmarcom\nprogrammes\nDeliver product\/service\nExchange Information\nInbound\nlogisticsR&D\nDeliver value proposition\nMonitor \nvalue\nAnalysis\nMarketing\nPlan(s)\nCustomer\ninformation\nPlan\nEffectiveness\nCommunicate value\n \n \nFigure 1  Summary of marketing map \nIt will be seen that boxes 1 and 2 are clearly about strategy determination, whilst boxes 3 \nand 4 are about tactical implementation and measurement.  It is these latter two that have \ncome to represent marketing as a function, which is still principally seen as sales support \nand promotion.  The author recently drove through a new housing estate, where a neon \nsign above an up-market prefab blasted out the following words:  \u201cThe Marketing Suite\u201d, \nloosely translated as:  \u201cThis is where you come to get sold to\u201d.  And when government \nbodies, charities and the like say \u201cwe need marketing\u201d, what they mostly mean is \u201cwe \nneed some promotion\u201d. \n \nThe options, then, are clear.  Firstly, let us all stop this pretence at strategy and \nconcentrate on where the marketing community actually is, which is sales support.  Or let \nus take marketing centre stage, with a major impact on corporate strategy development. \n \nThere is more than enough evidence (see, for example, Jenkins 1997) that one of the \nfundamental determinants of corporate success \u2013 ie. correct market definition, market \nsegmentation and positioning is poorly understood in the corporate world at large.  So, let \nus begin by looking in a little more detail at each of the boxes in Figure 1. \n \nThis process is clearly cyclical, in that monitoring the value delivered will update the \norganisation's understanding of the value that is required by its customers.  The cycle \nmay be predominantly an annual one, with a marketing plan documenting the output from \nthe '\u2018understand value'\u2019 and '\u2018develop value proposition'\u2019 processes, but equally changes \nthroughout the year may involve fast iterations around the cycle to respond to particular \nopportunities or problems. \n \nWe have used the term \u2018Determine value proposition\u2019, to make plain that we are here \nreferring to the decision-making process of deciding what the offering to the customer is \nto be \u2013 what value the customer will receive, and what value (typically the purchase price \nand on-going revenues) the organisation will receive in return.  The process of delivering \nthis value, such as by making and delivering a physical product or by delivering a \nservice, is covered by \u2018Deliver value proposition\u2019. \n \nThus, it can be seen that the first two boxes are concerned with strategic planning \nprocesses (in other words, developing market strategies), whilst the third and fourth \nboxes are concerned with the actual delivery in the market of what was planned and then \nmeasuring the effect.  Throughout, we use the word \u2018proposition\u2019 to indicate the nature of \nthe offer from the organisation to the market. \n \nIt is well known that not all of the value proposition delivering processes will be under \nthe control of the marketing department, whose role varies considerably between \norganisations.  The marketing department should be responsible for and central to the \nfirst two processes, \u2018Understand value\u2019 and \u2018Determine value proposition\u2019, although even \nthese need to involve numerous functions, albeit co-ordinated by specialist marketing \npersonnel.  The \u2018Deliver value\u2019 process is the role of the whole company, including for \nexample product development, manufacturing, purchasing, sales promotion, direct mail, \ndistribution, sales and customer service. \nThe various choices made during this marketing process are constrained and informed not \njust by the outside world, but also by the organisation\u2019s asset base.  Whereas an efficient \nnew factory with much spare capacity might underpin a growth strategy in a particular \nmarket, a factory running at full capacity would cause more reflection on whether price \nshould be used to control demand, unless the potential demand warranted further capital \ninvestment.  As well as physical assets, choices may be influenced by financial, human \nresources, brand and information technology assets, to name just a few.  (For a detailed \nexplanation of each of the four boxes, see McDonald, M., 2002). \n \n \nMarketing\u2019s Role in Value Creation \n \nThere is, however, one final, but crucial piece of the jigsaw to put in place.  Table 18 \nstates clearly that marketing can and should have a central role to play in creating \nsustainable competitive advantage. \nThe overall purpose of strategic\nmarketing, and its principal focus is the\nidentification and creation of\nsustainable competitive advantage\n\u00a9 Professor Malcolm McDonald, Cranfield School of Management\n \nTable 18  The purpose of strategic marketing planning \n \nFigure 2 shows a typical array from any stock exchange of the relationship between risk \nand return, the diagonal line being the Beta. \n \nHigh\nLow\nReturn\nHighLow\n1\n2\n3\nRisk\nAdapted from Sri Srikanthan, Cranfield School of Management  \n \nFigure 2  Financial Risk and Return \n \n \nAny firm on the line will normally be making industry average returns for its \nshareholders \u2013 in other words, making returns equal to the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC).  Firms making consistent returns greater then the WACC is creating \nshareholder wealth, known generally as Shareholder Value Added, Economic Value \nAdded, positive net present value, super profits, sustainable competitive advantage and so \non.  Figure 3 shows diagrammatically how sustainable competitive advantage can be \nachieved. \n \nDifferentiation\nHigh\nVolume\nSales Revenue\nLow Business\nRisk\nLow Financial\nRisk\nPositive\nNPV SCA\nEconomies\nof Scale\nLearning\nCurve\nHigh Cash\nFlows\nGearing\nInterest Cover\nWorking Capital Ratio\nOperational Leverage\nFinancial\nOperations\nLower\nCosts\n \n \n\u00a9 Professor Malcolm McDonald, Cranfield School of Management \n \nFigure 3  The route to sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) \n \n \nAs Doyle has pointed out (2000), modern finance is based on four principles: \n \n\u2022 cash flow (the basis of value) \n\u2022 the true value of money \n\u2022 the opportunity cost of capital (other investments of a similar risk) \n\u2022 the concept of net present value (the sum of the net cash flows discounted by the \nopportunity cost of capital) \n \nAlso, he pointed out that, whilst accountants do not measure intangible assets, the \ndiscrepancy between market and book values shows that investors do.  Hence, \nexpenditures to develop marketing assets make sense of the sum of the discounted cash \nflow they generate is positive. \n \nA little thought will indicate that every single corporate activity, whether it be R&D, IT, \npurchasing or logistics, is ultimately reflected in the relative value put on a firm\u2019s offer \nby its customers.  The marketing function, as defined in Figure 1, (but particularly the \nstrategic roles outlined in boxes 1 and 2) is central to this, as every one of the four, (or \nfive, six or seven Ps) can only be improved by the whole organisation focussing its \nattention on its customers. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn conclusion, we must find a way of escaping from the increasing proclivity of the \nacademic community to creep further and further into the more esoteric groves of \nacademe,  talking about increasingly narrow issues in an increasingly impenetrable \nlanguage to an increasingly narrow audience.  We must address issues which are of \nconcern to the real world and which are central to business success.  We can, in doing \nthis, be academic and rigorous, but we must then learn to translate our findings into \nactionable propositions. \n \nWe have a wellspring of young genius up and coming in our university business schools.  \nOur plea to all of us is that once they have been trained to be rigorous researchers, \npreferably via a PhD, they should be encouraged to be set free from all that is bad about \nthe current modus operandi and encouraged to address all this genius to the heartland of \nmarketing. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBaker, S.
