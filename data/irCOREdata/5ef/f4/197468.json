Whilst institutional entrepreneurship emphasizes the deliberate \ninstitution-building by a select few, distributed agency highlights the emergent institution-building that \ninvolves all organizational members.

We analyze the micro-discursive processes during a crucial event in the \ninstitutionalization of a new organizational template in a UK public-private partnership. We found that \ninstitutional transmission hinged upon enabling the recipients to act as agents (hence, distributed agency) \nthrough dialogue around the audience\u201fs identity, interests and local concerns vis-\u00e0-vis coercive \ninstitutional pressures.   \nKEY WORDS    Dialogue, Discourse, Distributed Agency, Institutional theory, Institutional \nentrepreneurship. \n \n 2 \nDIALOGUE AND DISTRIBUTED AGENCY IN INSTITUTIONAL TRANSMISSION \n \nThis paper is about the \u201cinstitutional work\u201d (Lawrence & Suddaby 2006) involved in the implementation \nof an institutional innovation.  We ask: How does an institutional innovation become accepted by \norganizational members?  In general terms, our query points to an important step in the process of \ninstitutionalization, located in Berger and Luckmann\u201fs (1967) scheme between objectivation and \ninternalization.  To answer this question, we introduce two contributions to the established model of \ninstitutional transmission.  Firstly, we broaden the interpretation of institutional agency beyond the \ninstitutional entrepreneur to include, potentially, each and every organizational member.  To initiate and \npromote an institutional innovation requires an institutional entrepreneur, but to embed it in and turn it \ninto a taken-for-granted element of organizational reality, we suggest, calls for the participation of all \nactors expected to enact the innovation.  To capture this collective property of institutionalization, we \noffer the term \u201edistributed agency\u201f.  Secondly, we contribute to the understanding of institutional \ntransmission by highlighting the role of \u201cinterpreters\u201d in modifying the innovation in dialogue with its \nrecipients.  Constructing \u201cbuy in\u201d on the part of recipients, we suggest, requires engaging in a dialogue \nthat re-constructs the innovation as congruent with the audience\u201fs interests, identity and local conditions.  \nTo reflect this relational\/interactive property of institutionalization, we employ the notion of \u201edialogue\u201f.  \nIn our theorizing we build on the literatures on institutional work, distributed organizational phenomena \n(e.g., distributed cognition, distributed leadership) and dialogical organizational processes (e.g., dialogical \nlearning). \nTo explore the role of distributed agency and dialogue, we take an empirical case of the \nintroduction of a new template in a single organization, a public-private partnership located in the United \nKingdom that delivers employment services to job seekers in areas of high unemployment.  From a macro \nperspective, our case is a classic example of coercive isomorphism - the imposition of an organizational \npractice by a powerful institutional actor - since the new template was introduced under pressure from the \ncontractor, the UK government\u201fs Department for Work and Pension, to improve the quality of the data \n 3 \nsupplied to the Department.  We, however, concentrate on the micro-processes involved in the \nimplementation of the new template in order to uncover what went on \u201cunder the surface\u201d of \nacquiescence to the official mandate.  In so doing we respond to calls for institutional theorists to \n\u201eincrease the magnification of their research microscopes\u201f (Elsbach 2002: 54-55) and develop \u201ea more \nmicro and fieldwork tradition\u201f (Palmer & Biggart 2002: 276) in order to attend to the \u201eactors who give \nmeaning and life to institutions\u201f (Dacin, Goodstein & Scott 2002: 47).  As our case deals with the \nintroduction of a quality initiative, the study also speaks to the issues of retention and customized \napplication raised, respectively, by Zbaracki (1998: 612, 621-626) and David and Strang (2006: 230) in \ntheir analyzes of the implementation of total quality management programs.  \nOur analysis focuses on one crucial event \u2013 a training session intended to familiarize the \nemployees with the new information system designed to support the data quality requirements.  We \nexamine the discursive interactions between the trainers responsible for implementing the new \ninformation system and their audience, i.e. the organizational members who are expected to enact the new \nquality template.  Our analysis shows that, even though the innovation had already been sanctioned by a \npowerful institutional actor and translated into the language of the focal organization, its implementation \nwas by no means a fait accompli, but required the concerted efforts of the trainers and their audience to \nmake the innovation palatable and acceptable.  Our analysis of the dialogue between the trainers and the \naudience shows that achieving \u201cbuy-in\u201d requires investing the recipients of an innovation with agentic \nqualities.  We distinguish three forms of agency present in the dialogue that allowed the recipients to be \nagents rather than \u201cmere pawns\u201d: (1) defining their identity vis-\u00e0-vis coercive pressures, (2) articulating \ntheir interests, and (3) recognizing their rights to do things \u201ctheir way\u201d.  The outcome of this dialogue is, \nwe suggest, a reinterpreted and modified institutional template that facilitates, rather than hinders, the \ntransmission of the innovation.   \nThe paper is structured as follows: firstly, in the next section we elaborate our theoretical points \nof departure and subsequently, the third section presents our empirical case and embeds it into a broader \ninstitutional context.  The fourth section outlines the methodology employed in the study.  In the fifth \n 4 \nsection we present the analysis of the empirical material.  Finally, we discuss our findings and consider \nthe implications of our work for theory development. \nAGENCY AND INSTITUTIONAL TRANSMISSION \nThe question of how to understand the transmission of institutions across time and space, and the role of \nagency in this process, has been central to institutional theory since its inception and remains contested to \nthis date.  The so-called old institutionalism, associated with the works of Selznick (1949), Gouldner \n(1954), and Zald (1970), has been commonly portrayed (occasionally in caricature) as a primarily action-\noriented perspective, focusing on intra-organizational processes, dynamics, endogenous change, values \nand conflict of interests (DiMaggio & Powell 1991: 13; Hirsch & Lounsbury 1997: 408).  The old \ninstitutionalism interpreted institutionalization as a bottom-up process, wherein agents are given a \nprimary role in creating and shaping institutions, which paid little attention to the issue of institutional \ntransmission across organizations.  In contrast, the new institutionalism, launched by Meyer and Rowan\u201fs \n(1977) and DiMaggio and Powell\u201fs (1983) seminal articles (DiMaggio & Powell 1991), has been widely \ncredited with redirecting attention to structure and moving towards a higher level of analysis by \nhighlighting the dominance of the environment, stressing organizational stability and inertia, and adopting \na cognitive approach to institutions (i.e., examining taken-for-granted beliefs and shared meanings) \n(DiMaggio & Powell 1991: Hirsch & Lounsbury 1997; Scott 2001: 83-88).  The new institutionalism \noffered a sophisticated model of institutional diffusion by delineating three key mechanisms of \ninstitutional isomorphism: coercive (stemming \u201cfrom political influence and the problem of legitimacy\u201d), \nmimetic (\u201cresulting from standard responses to uncertainty\u201d) and normative (\u201cassociated with \nprofessionalization\u201d) (DiMaggio & Powell 1983: 150).  This model in turn generated extensive empirical \nresearch on diffusion (cf. Strang and Soule (1988) for review) and the forces of isomorphism (cf. \nMizruchi and Fein (1999) for review and Heugens and Lander (2007) for meta-analysis of findings).  The \nnew institutionalism, however, downplayed the role of agency (DiMaggio 1988: 3,; DiMaggio & Powell \n 5 \n1991: 22) and portrayed institutionalization as a predominantly top-down imposition of institutionalized \npatterns on overly constrained organizations (Oliver 1991: 147-148).  \nIn response to the extensive critique of the new institutionalism for its lack of attention to agency \n(e.g., Hirsch 1997, Hirsch & Lounsbury 1997; Selznick 1996; Stinchcombe 1997), a \u201cthird-wave\u201d of \ninstitutional theory (for want of a better term) has emerged, described as \u201ethe coming together of the old \nand the new institutionalism\u201f (Greenwood & Hinings 1996: 1023).  The third-wave institutionalism \nfocuses on the institutional work that underlies the process of institution-building (Lawrence & Suddaby \n2006).  This approach reconciles the action and structure orientations of the old and new institutionalism \n(e.g., Barley & Tolbert 1997; Hasselbladh & Kallinikos 2000) and enables us to explore \u201ethe effects of \nindividual and organizational action \u2026 aimed at creating, maintaining, and disrupting institutions\u201f \n(Lawrence & Suddaby 2006: 216).  This third-wave institutionalism has greatly advanced our \nunderstanding of agency and institutionalization.  Yet, it has some limitations, of which we note two: a \nnarrow locus of agency and an incomplete description of the process of institutional transmission. \nTo date, institutional research has tended to view agency as \u201eattributed either to an organization as \na whole (Goodstein 1994; Oliver 1991) or to individuals who occupy central roles in an organization \n(Brint & Karabel 1991; Zucker & Darby 1997)\u201f (Zilber 2002: 236).  Agentic qualities are ascribed only to \nthe \u201cexceptional\u201d individuals and organizations, namely, institutional entrepreneurs (Beckert 1999; \nDiMaggio 1988,1991; Fligstein 1997; Garud, Hardy & Maguire 2007; Greenwood & Suddaby 2006), \nrenegades (Kondra & Hinings 1998) and outsiders (Greenwood, Suddaby & Hinings 2002; Kraatz & \nMoore 2002).  These assumptions have led researchers to overlook the role of the majority of \norganizational members, who are arguably vital to institutional transmission because without their \ninvolvement, any institutional innovation would remain at the level of a plan, aspiration or ideal.  In our \nview, this omission is problematic because an institutional template that is not enacted by the members of \nan organizational field would invariably fail to become an institution at all.  This point has tended to be \noverlooked in the existing literature on institutional theory of diffusion (e.g., Abrahamson 1991; \nGooderham, Nordhaug & Ringdal 1999; Guler, Guillen & Macpherson 2002; Ingram & Simons 1995: \n 6 \nO\u201fNeill, Pouder & Ruchholtz 1998; Strang & Meyer 1993; Tolbert & Zucker 1983).  Due to its macro \nfocus, this literature has few means for finely distinguishing between the tactics employed in making \npractices more \u201cacceptable\u201d (and thereby adoptable) to its recipients. \nBeyond Institutional Entrepreneurship \nTo address these limitations and further our understanding of agency and institutional transmission, we \noffer a new set of theoretical instruments: distributed agency and dialogue.  \nDistributed agency \nThe concept of distributed agency helps to develop a more wide-reaching approach to agency, as \npioneered by Zilber (2002), that also draws upon a wider tradition within organization studies that \nhighlights the distributed nature of organizational phenomena, including: distributed entrepreneurial \nagency (Garud & Karn\u00f8e 2003), distributed cognition (Hutchins 1995), distributed framing (Hardie & \nMackenzie 2007) and distributed leadership (Gronn 2002).  Distributed agency implies the involvement, \ninteraction and conjoint activity of multiple actors and reflects social structure and context, as they affect \nthe distribution of agency throughout the system (cf. Giere and Moffatt (2003: 303) on distributed \ncognition).  The concept is valuable for helping to move beyond the \u201cstructure\/agency dualism\u201d, in which \nagency is either the result of changes to the structural relationship or the result of individual action (cf. \nBennet, Wise, Wood & Harvey (2003: 7) on distributed leadership).  \nWe suggest that the term \u201cinstitutional entrepreneurship\u201d can be reserved to denote the frame-\nbreaking efforts of a few (individual and\/or collective) actors involved in deliberate institution-building, \nwhereas the term \u201cdistributed agency\u201d can be used to reveal the more mundane and less prominent, but \nnevertheless essential, activities of \u201cothers\u201d in the institutional work associated with emergent institution-\nbuilding (cf. Quack 2007: 659).  To use the popular metaphor of the theatre (e.g., \u201cactor\u201d, \u201cfront \nstage\/back stage\u201d, \u201cscript\u201d), institutional entrepreneurship focuses on the leading actors, whereas \ndistributed agency also pays attention to the rest of the cast, the \u201cstage-hands\u201d and other supporting \n 7 \nmembers from \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d (cf. Lawrence & Suddaby 2006: 249), and last, but not the least, the \naudience.  \nDialogue \nParallel to expanding the notion of agency to include distributed agency, we also suggest to \u201copen up\u201d the \nprocess of institutional transmission to incorporate dialogue.  In accordance with the third-wave \ninstitutionalism, the concept of dialogue helps to restore the qualities of \u201cfluidity\u201d, \u201cplasticity\u201d and \n\u201cpliability\u201d to the notions of institution and institutionalization (cf. Hirsch & Boal 2000: 256).  This \nmeans taking seriously the social interactions involved in transmission and the role of recipients in the \nconstruction of meaning around institutional change.  This highlights the reciprocity involved in \ninstitutionalization and portrays institutional work as a collective endeavor accomplished by multiple \nactors and incorporating multiple inputs.  This fits well with the companion concept of distributed agency, \nas both emphasize involvement of a wide range of actors.  Dialogue implies a process whereby \nindividuals generate a shared (but by no means identical and not necessarily consensual) understanding of \na local situation through their interaction with other individuals (as well as with artefacts).  It is this inter-\nsubjective engagement that gives institutionalization its fluidity \u2013 both in terms of being incessantly in \nmotion and in terms of generating variation rather than perpetuating an invariant pattern.  \nThe temporal and spatial context, or a local interaction \u201carena\u201d (Lave 1988), is crucial to the \nunderstanding of dialogical processes.  Hence, we draw on the situated action approach to cognition, \nwhich originated in the work of researchers affiliated in the 1980s with the Palo Alto Institute for \nResearch on Learning, such as Lave, Suchman and Wenger (e.g., Lave & Wenger 1991; Suchman 1987; \nWenger 1998) and was popularized in organization studies by Brown and Duguid (1991).  In contrast \nwith the traditional focus of cognitive research on \u201cinside-the-head\u201d phenomena and the focus of \u201cold\u201d \nsocial cognition research on \u201cthinking about social stimuli\u201d, the situated action approach to cognition \nstresses that \u201ehumans do much of their thinking in a social context\u201f (Schwarz 1998: 247, 251).  Its \nproponents argue that \u201ecognitive activities should be understood primarily as interactions between agents \n 8 \nand physical systems and with other people\u201f (Greeno & Moore 1993: 49).  This view interprets cognitions \nas an interactive and collaborative process rather than an exclusively individual act (Levine, Resnick & \nHiggins 1993: 586) and as a process necessarily situated relative to a local context, which includes \npeople\u201fs interrelations with one another and with artefacts (Lorenz 2001: 318).  \nWhile the concept of dialogue fits with the discourse approach in institutional analysis (Phillips & \nHardy 1997; Phillips, Lawrence & Hardy 2000; Phillips, Lawrence & Hardy  2004), it departs from the \nunity and coherence emphasized by the concept of narrative (which is currently the primary focus of \ndiscursive studies of institutions), by also revealing the potential for discord and dispersion.  Our \ntreatment of discourse here is therefore consonant with Green\u201fs suggestion (2004; also cf. Boje, Oswick \n& Ford 2004) that discourses do not necessarily conform to the dominant institutional template, but may \nfrequently depart from it.  It is these departures that provide the focal point of interest for our analysis.  \nThe concept of dialogue also resonates with the broader range of dialogic analyses of other organizational \nphenomena, such as learning (Oswick, Anthony, Keenoy, Mangham & Grant 2000), change (Jabri 2004) \nand identity (Carlsen 2006).  Together, the concepts of dialogue and distributed agency enrich our \nunderstanding by allowing for the complexity and multivocality that is, we suggest, typical of institutional \ntransmission. \nInstitutionalization through the Lens of Distributed Agency and Dialogue \nFrom our perspective, institutions are constantly \u201cunder construction\u201d through a process of inter-\nsubjective dialogue, that is, dependent on the meanings embedded in the interpretive frames and \nembodied in the situated performances of actors (Goffman 1959,1967).  Fine\u201fs (1996: 112) study of \nrestaurant kitchens exemplifies this situatedness of social action: preparing a meal is not a stable, \nunchanging script, but may vary from being a profession, art, business or manual labor depending on \n\u201ewhen and if they seem appropriate\u201f to the situation.  Similarly, Creed, Scully and Austin (2002: 475) \nhighlight the \u201ecomplexity and uncertainty of institutional reproduction\u201f where reframing is done \nopportunistically by actors choosing between alternative frames, albeit driven by attachment to a master \n 9 \nframe.  From a situational perspective, agents can select from different institutional norms akin to the \nselection of different clothing.  For instance, anti-gay groups can, paradoxically, adopt the gay rights \ndiscourse to argue for freedom from discrimination by gays (Creed et al 2002: 489), for example, when a \nnon-gay person applies for a waiter position in a gay bar.  Hence, given that the possibilities of practice \ncannot be anticipated by the templates, we need to focus on the \u201clive\u201d process whereby templates are \nenacted rather than the \u201clifeless\u201d templates themselves (Seo & Creed 2002).  \nEMPIRICAL CASE: INSTITUTIONALIZING QUALITY IN BACK2WORK \nTo illuminate our argument, we draw on the empirical data from a qualitative study of the introduction of \na new information system in a UK public-private partnership organization called Back2Work (all names \nare pseudonyms).  Back2Work delivers employment services in areas of high unemployment (known as \n\u201eEmployment Zones\u201f) across the United Kingdom contracted from the UK government Department for \nWork and Pensions (hereafter DWP).  In the first six years since the company was founded in 2000, it \nhelped more than 70,000 people gain and maintain paid employment.   \nThe study focused on the implementation of a new information system called \u201eQuality \nFramework\u201f that was designed by Back2Work to improve the quality of the data supplied to the DWP \nabout jobseekers (including information such as the number who have secured work and how long they \nmaintain employment) in response to new contractual requirements established by the DWP in 2005.  \nThese contractual requirements reflect a wider shift towards accountability, evidence-based policy and \n\u201caudit culture\u201d (Strathern 2000) in the institutional field of public services, associated with the rise of \nNew Public Management in the UK (and beyond) (Clarke & Newman 1997; Hood 1998; Pollitt & \nBouckaert 2004).  \nAlso relevant to understanding the case study is the context of the New Labour government\u201fs \ndrive to create a new institutional model of public service delivery that is more innovative and responsive \nthan traditional public bureaucracies (i.e. the government-run Job Centre) (Clarke, Newman, Smith, \n 10 \nVidler & Westmarland 2007), including experimental modes of public-private (and voluntary) partnership \n(exemplified by Back2Work).  From 2000 onwards, the contractual requirements from the DWP reflected \nthe governmental policy focus on exploring the potential for innovation and responsiveness from the \nprivate and voluntary sectors.  Accordingly, Back2Work, in the early years of operation, concentrated on \n\u201egetting results\u201f as opposed to \u201edotting Is and crossing Ts\u201f, in the words of one of its managers (Interview \nwith Bob, Quality Framework Project Sponsor).  The 2002 Back2Work Annual Report described the \ncompany as proud of its ability to \u201ecut through red tape and take risks\u201f.  As an example of an unorthodox \nsolution to the problem of long-term unemployment, Back2Work arranged for a job seeker to have tattoo \nremoval surgery on his face to increase his employability.  \nThe more recent shift in emphasis towards \u201eevidence-based policy\u201f, where public policy and \nspending is tied to evidence of the impact and effectiveness of initiatives (such as comparing how many \njobseekers find sustainable employment following help from public-private partnerships like Back2Work, \nversus the government-run Job Centre), led to a change in contractual requirements from the DWP.  As \nthe contract facilitator from the DWP explained to us:  \nEmployment Zones came about, it was an idea that if we freed up the private and not-for-profit \nsector, could they do things better?\u2026 [but] it\u2019s got to be evidence-based policy\u2026 Whenever a \npiece of government policy comes into practice, there\u2019s always a team of statisticians and \nevaluators who will assess it over years\u2026 \u2018Did it work and can we measure how it worked?\u2019  \n(Interview with Dave, Department for Work and Pensions contract facilitator) \n \nHence, a new set of contract requirements, tied to a system of incentives and penalties, were constructed \nin 2005 to encourage contractors to improve the quality of data held about jobseekers.  Failure to meet the \ndata quality targets would incur significant financial penalties and could ultimately result in losing the \ncontract.  In response, Back2Work designed Quality Framework with the aim to improve controls over \nthe collection and storage of data about jobseekers.  As noted by the senior business sponsor of the \nQuality Framework project at Back2Work: \n 11 \n\u2026 there was a wake-up call to us to take a look at quality from a contract-compliant \nperspective\u2026 against the backcloth of increasing contractor requirements, very much around the \ndetail of the delivery.  It meant that we run the risk of losing contracts if we didn\u2019t act and didn\u2019t \nact fast.  \n(Interview with Bob, Quality Framework Project Sponsor) \n \nAs another senior manager explained:  \n\u2026 they [the DWP] are not only focusing on how many people we\u2019re getting into work, but they\u2019re \nfocusing on the quality of the data that we export to them and the underpinning paperwork. \n(Interview with Mary, Senior Manager) \n \nIn institutional theory terms, then, our case study can be understood as an example of institutional \ntransmission of a new quality template, facilitated through forces of coercive isomorphism.   \nCoercive isomorphism, especially through direct imposition, presents a critical test for the \u201cthird-\nwave institutionalism \u2013 and for our dialogical distributed agency account of institutionalization.  Given \nthe strong forces of coercive isomorphism in our case, we would expect to find top-down \ninstitutionalization par excellence, with rigid constraints on actors and action on the receiving end.  Yet, \nas our analysis below shows, our study uncovered substantial room for creativity and reframing.  It is \nimportant to note that the DWP data quality requirements did not mandate any particular solution and it \nwas Back2Work\u201fs strategic choice to construct a technological solution in the form of a new information \nsystem (Quality Framework).   \nMETHODOLOGY \nData Collection  \nThis paper draws on one observational event from a wider qualitative study of Back2Work conducted \nbetween October 2005 and February 2006.  The study was designed to combine semi-structured \ninterviews with non-participant observation of day-to-day work activities, such as meetings, training \n 12 \nsessions, client consultations and general \u201cshadowing\u201d of work activities, during the roll-out phase of the \nnew Quality Framework information system.  The data were collected using the following sources: \n(1) thirty interviews between 15 and 90 minutes with organizational members, including senior \nmanagement, information technology developers and suppliers, employment consultants and \nadministrative employees,  in nine different locations across the UK (including one supplier side);  \n(2) eighteen observations, including the observations of project meetings, information technology \ndevelopment meetings, training sessions, supplier meetings, troubleshooting meetings, project evaluation \nsessions and informal \u201cshadowing\u201d observations of everyday work activities across seven different \nlocations across the UK (including one supplier site); \n(3) twelve documents, including project briefs, project costing and planning documentation, \nmeeting agendas, work process maps and training documents; \n(4) numerous e-mail communications, where the researchers were copied into email exchanges \nrelating to the change process. \nMost of the interviews (24 out of 30) and some of the observations (8 out of 18) were recorded \nusing a digital audio-recording device (where the presence of a recording device was permitted and not \ndeemed too intrusive).  Observations were written up in field-notes either in real-time or shortly after the \nevent in cases where note taking would have interrupted the flow of interaction, such as informal \nconversations during coffee breaks.  \nThe following analysis focuses on a training session for the staff in one of the Back2Work offices \nbased in Birmingham in the Midlands.  The training event provides an ideal site for exploring the \ninstitutionalization process because it represents a critical moment in translating templates from the \nbroader institutional field (i.e., the Government and DWP) into the everyday practices of organizational \nmembers (i.e., the Back2Work employees and their clients).  For example, training and awareness events \nare often where institutional innovations are first introduced and hence where the acceptability of the \nscript is established and the meaning of a template is negotiated (e.g., \u201cWhat is Quality Framework \nabout?\u201d, \u201cWhat will it mean for me?\u201d).  The training event was chosen because it is representative of the \n 13 \nbroader findings of the study, which uncovered a general pattern of practices that dialogically re-\ninterpreted the managerially-sanctioned quality template, as discussed in more detail below.  Whilst other \nobservations revealed similar processes, the event chosen exemplifies the sort of dialogue and distributed \nagency that, we suggest, accompany not only this case but also other cases of institutional transmission \nmore generally.  The event was also chosen because training sessions are likely to amplify these processes \nof dialogue and distributed agency, insofar as training sessions are often where organizational members \nfirst meet innovations, before their meaning becomes established and taken-for-granted (i.e., \ninstitutionalized).  \nData Analysis  \nData analysis was conducted with the aim of understanding \u201emeaning-making in vivo and in situ\u201f (Zilber \n2007: 1051).  Qualitative research such as this is particularly well-suited to \u201eunderstand the actual \nproduction of meanings and concepts used by social actors in real settings\u201f (Gephart 2004: 457).  We \ndeliberately analyze observational data from naturally-occurring events and interactions as opposed to \nrelying on \u201ctexts\u201d or interviews.  While interviews are valuable sources of insight, they tend to elicit the \nreproduction of taken-for-granted \u201cscripts\u201d without investigating how they affect practice (Mueller & \nCarter 2005: 241; Bergstr\u00f6m & Knights 2006: 355).  Similarly, texts such as company documents, \nmemos, manuals, etc. may be quite distanced from what actually happens in the field.  Fieldwork \nobservation was therefore central to our methodology because it enabled us to investigate what happens \n\u201con the ground\u201d when institutions, such as the quality template in our case, travel over time and across \ndifferent locales. \nThe first stage of data analysis involved transcribing the digital recording of the observation and \ntyping up the accompanying hand-written field notes.  Where notes had been written by more than one \nresearcher, the accounts were cross-checked to produce a single record.  It is important to note that the \ndata-set was not \u201ctheory free\u201d in the sense that decisions about what to collect and how to collect it were \ninformed by the theoretical suppositions of the researchers (Bryman 1988; Bryman & Burgess 1994; \n 14 \nHammersley & Atkinson 1995).  The analysis involved a process of \u201cabduction\u201d, i.e. a combination of \ninduction and deduction.  This means that we simultaneously moved upwards from the data and \ndownwards from abstract theory in an iterative, back-and-forth process.  This process was important \nbecause different theories enabled us to illuminate different parts of the data set or the same data in \ndifferent ways.  Our aim was to exploit, rather than eliminate, the tendency for research to be conducted \nthrough a particular \u201clens\u201d, which involves \u201e[adopting], either tacitly or explicitly, certain ways of seeing\u201f \n(Silverman 1993: 46).  \nBy adopting an exploratory approach to data analysis (Bryman 1988; Silverman 1993), our aim \nwas not to verify the validity, reliability or generality of particular accounts or interpretations.  For \nexample, we do not argue that the trainers in our analysis were \u201ccorrect\u201d and the audience \u201cwrong\u201d in \nhow they made sense of the quality template.  Rather, we examine how these various accounts (from \ninterviews, observations, documents, etc.) played a role in negotiating, establishing and\/or challenging the \nmeaning of the quality template.  Thus, our aim was to generate theoretical insight as opposed to \nestablishing empirical generalizability from the data (Bryman 1988).   \nFurthermore, we have chosen the event analyzed in this paper (a training session) because it was \ntypical of the findings of the study as a whole.  For example, the study uncovered patterns of creative \nadaptation, deviation, reinterpretation and appropriation of the technology in other settings, including \nproject meetings, trouble-shooting sessions and the day-to-day use of the new system.  This variation \noccurred, we suggest, for a variety of practical reasons that were relative to the users\u201f various contexts.  \nFor example, deviations and adaptations emerged as users attempted to make sense of the meaning of the \nartefact (e.g., \u201cWhat changes should I make to my work routines to make this system work for me?\u201d), \ncontextualize the legitimacy of the artifact (e.g., \u201cWhy am I being asked to enter this information?\u201d), \nadapt it to local practices (e.g., \u201cWe would prefer to do this differently\u201d), minimize disruption to \nestablished work practices (e.g., \u201cI don\u201ft want to do all this extra work\u201d) and establish an identity as a \ncompetent user and committed employee (e.g., \u201cThe back-log must be because the system is wrong, not \nme\u201d).   \n 15 \nOur sample of data was also chosen to illustrate themes that have theoretical generality that is \nrelevant to others interested in processes of institutionalization.  While other situations would of course \nnot be expected to replicate the exact same transmission mechanisms we identify below - for example, not \nevery situation will involve distancing (see Table 1, section 1a) or appeals to self-interest (see Table 1, \nsection 2a) as in our case - the finding that institutional templates are re-framed and modified through a \nprocess of distributed agency and dialogue is important for understanding processes of institutionalization \nmore generally.  For instance, it is reasonable to speculate that the \u201cchange champions\u201d in our case would \nhave drawn on a different set of transmission mechanisms if they had faced a different set of concerns \nfrom their audience (e.g., concerns that the proposed change would involve less work rather than more \nwork for them, sparking worries about possible job losses), or if they had faced a different interaction \n\u201carena\u201d (Lave 1988) altogether (e.g., a group of senior managers as opposed to administrative staff).  \nThese other scenarios, and indeed any other case where generic institutional templates meet specific local \ncontexts, would also illustrate our thesis that institutionalization is not the product of the sole efforts of \ninstitutional entrepreneurs, but a collective accomplishment of all those involved (hence the term \n\u201cdistributed agency\u201d).  We will now turn to analyse the training event that comprises the focus of our \nanalysis. \nANALYSIS \nOur analysis focuses on a training session at a regional office of Back2Work.  The purpose of the session \nwas to introduce a new information system designed to improve the quality of the data about jobseekers \nsupplied to the contractor, the UK government Department for Work and Pensions.  Fourteen participants \nwere present, including two researchers, ten administrative staff, the trainer Shirley and the IT \nrepresentative Catherine.  The trainer was in charge of the \u201csoft\u201d, human relations side of the introduction \nof the quality initiative, and the IT representative was in charge of the \u201chard\u201d, technology side of the \ninitiative.  Note here that the change agents (the trainer and the IT representative) delivered what had \n 16 \nalready been translated into the language and realities of the organization.  The principles of evidence-\nbased policy and performance measurement had already been paraphrased from a generic New Public \nManagement blueprint into a more context-specific template of the contractual requirements of the \nDepartment for Work and Pensions and further interpreted by the receiving organization, Back2Work, as \nan information system solution to the data quality problem.  However, the process of institutionalization \nwas still incomplete, as the staff of Back2Work had not yet embraced the new practices.  Without their \ncooperation, the quality template would fail to be institutionalized.  The training session was thus an \nimportant step towards the \u201cbedding down\u201d of the new practice \u2013 a crucial stage in its institutionalization.   \nTable 1 presents a series of extracts from the interaction between the trainers (Shirley and \nCatherine) and the audience (the employees targeted to change their practices).  Two notes on our \npresentational style are needed here.  First, for the purpose of grouping the extracts, the data is not \npresented in sequential order, but the time of each extract is instead marked.  Second, while the themes \nwe identify were prevalent throughout the whole session (seven hours of recording), in each section we \nhave selected the verbatim quotes that best illustrate the theme in question. \n \n[Insert Table 1 around here] \nThe findings presented in Table 1 show that we did not observe the process of diffusion of the \nquality template that we expected from such a tightly-coupled institutional field, with \u201eclearly legitimated \norganizational templates and highly articulated mechanisms \u2026 for transmitting those templates to \norganizations within the sector\u201f (Greenwood & Hinings 1996: 1029).  In this institutional context, we \nexpected to find a linear process of diffusion, beginning with the strong coercive isomorphic mechanisms \nof the institutional context (i.e. the government\u201fs contractual requirements that mandated and enforced the \nnew emphasis on data quality), translated into a new information system by senior management, then \naccepted by staff and incorporated into their working practices.  \nTable 1 shows that appeals to the institutional legitimacy of the quality template \u2013 both at a \nregulatory level from the DWP and at an organizational level from senior management \u2013 failed to \n 17 \nestablish the legitimacy of the template at a local level.  The staff from the Midlands office demonstrated \ntheir agency in the form of resistance, cynicism and skepticism resulting from the clash between the \ntemplate and their pre-existing local meanings, practices and agendas.  For instance, the audience were \nresistant to the perceived increase in workload they anticipated from the introduction of the new template \n(see quote 2(a) iii.).  Skepticism was also expressed about the viability of the new quality template, given \ntheir first-hand knowledge of the job they do (see quote 2(a) i.), and their preferred local practices and \nroutines (see quote 3(c) ii.).  Whilst skepticism or resistance are by no means unusual or unexpected \nresponses (Putnam, Grant, Mickelson & Cutcher 2005), in this particular context it occurred in spite of the \nlegitimacy of the quality template from two institutional levels, from being mandated and enforced by the \ngovernment department that provided the contract and from being sanctioned by senior management in \nBack2Work. \nThe agency of the audience led to a dialogue between the trainers and staff that we have grouped \ninto three aspects: identity, interests and need for voice (see Table 1).  This dialogue was designed to find \ncreative methods of transmission to respond to the specific context in hand, or in Lave\u201fs (1988) terms, the \nlocal interaction \u201carena\u201d, i.e. by responding to the specific concerns expressed by the staff of the \nMidlands office.  This dialogue is significant for how it led to the deviation, adaptation and corruption of \nthe received template.  For instance, deviation from the template occurred when the trainers attempted to \ndistance themselves from the \u201cscript\u201d provided for them in an attempt to identify with the audience and \nconstruct a shared identity of \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201f\u201d (see quotes 1(a) i. and 1(a) ii.).  The dialogue also led \nto a recognition of the need for adaptation as a result of the audience\u201fs local knowledge of their job (see \n3(a) i-iii) and the need to incorporate local practices and routines (see 3(c) i.-iv.).  Finally, the template \nwas corrupted as the trainers attempted to appeal to the sectional interests of their audience, for instance, \nby arguing that the new template would make their jobs easier and reduce their workload (see 2(a) i.-v.).  \nBy appealing to the audience\u201fs self-interest in this way, the institutional legitimacy of the template (i.e. \nwe must do this because it is mandated by the DWP and sanctioned by management) was corrupted in an \nattempt to make the template more acceptable and palatable to the local audience.  \n 18 \nThis transformation of the quality template, we suggest, demonstrates the distributed agency at \nplay whereby the local concerns and meanings of the staff at the Midlands office become incorporated \ninto the template during the dialogue that occurred in the training session.  In other words, when the \ntemplate met the agency of the Midlands staff in the form of skepticism and outright resistance, the \nchange agents sought to enter into dialogue with their audience (as opposed to ignoring their concerns).  \nIn doing so, the template was altered to make it more \u201csocially acceptable and credible\u201d (Weick 1995: 61) \nto the audience, even if this also corrupted its original, institutionally-mandated and managerially-\nsanctioned meaning and led to unintended outcomes (Balogun & Johnson 2005).  As such, agency was \nnot simply in the hands of the institutional entrepreneurs that envisaged the new quality requirements at \nthe DWP or the senior managers in Back2Work that translated it into a new information system, but was \nalso distributed across the organization, including those members at the bottom of the organizational \nhierarchy that comprised the \u201ctargets\u201d of the new template.  While the dialogue we observed deviated, \nadapted and corrupted the template, we suggest that this did not undermine, but rather facilitated, the \ntransmission of the template.  For instance, it is unlikely the quality template would become \n\u201chabitualized\u201d (Berger & Luckman 1967) if the trainers simply reproduced the template (our findings \nshow that this had clearly failed), and refused to recognize the agency of the audience by engaging in \ndialogue, leaving the audience remaining skeptical and resistant. \nDISCUSSION \nThe findings of this study suggest that the transmission of institutions involves more than simple linear \nprocesses of diffusion but rather (a) an interactive and collaborative process that is (b) situated relative to \na particular local context.  We observed a distributed and dialogical process whereby agency was not in \nthe hands of a few, but rather distributed amongst the many actors involved in the situation and relative to \nthe context of interaction.  Context is important to this process because different contexts, such as the \nproject meetings attended by the system designers and senior management that we observed, involved a \n 19 \ndifferent set of interpretations that led to different sets of meanings about the quality template being \nconstructed. \nOur point of departure was the question: \u201cWhat actually happens when coercive isomorphic \npressures hit the ground, in this case the imposition of a quality template by a powerful government \nactor\u201d?  Given that Total Quality Management (TQM) has recently been described as past its \u201cprime\u201d and \n\u201esuffering from disillusionment and scepticism\u201f even in the UK, with a renewed focus on its technical \nfoundations, there is increased \u201epotential for customized applications\u201f (David and Strang 2006: 231).  By \nexamining what happened during a specific training session we ask: \u201cWhat does this customization look \nlike\u201d? \nWe found that implementation\/diffusion of a template can be facilitated by (a) creating a positive \nsense of identity for the audience, whether this is a collective \u201cwe\u201d and\/or a sectional \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus\u201d \n(see Table 1, section 1.), (b) appealing to the interests of the audience, both at the level of collective \ninterests and self-interests (see Table 1, section 2), and (c) making the audience feel that they have a voice \nand input in the transmission of the template (see Table 1, section 3).  These are specific tactics that can \nbe employed to help embed specific TQM practices into organization processes \u2013 an important issue \ngiven the widely held view that implementation failure is substantially due to the company and its local \nunit leaders not  \u201emaking TQM an integral part of their organizational unit\u201fs practice and culture\u201f (Beer \n2003: 626).  Our account goes beyond existing efforts by outlining the micro-context, where agents \ndiscursively allocate people voice, an identity or interests.  The practical effect of these discursive \nactivities is to successfully complete the training session, or indeed any other such activity in the \ntransmission of a template, and thereby drive forward the implementation process.  \nBy bringing voice, identity and interest creatively into play, the trainers responded to the \ndifficulties that they seemed to encounter.  What the examples we found have in common is their attempt \nto engage in dialogue with the meanings-in-construction by the audience and thereby increase their \ncommitment to the implementation process.  The concerns of the recipients were not simply ignored and \n\u201cbull-dozed\u201d over in a rigid imposition of a coercively-enforced template.  This dialogue was achieved in \n 20 \nvarious ways, as detailed in Table 1, such as by displaying sensitivity and respect for the voice of the \naudience, in this case by displaying recognition of the legitimacy of their concerns (see 3(a)) and by \nrecognizing their rights to have voice (see 3(b)) and maintain local variations (see 3(c)).  Second, the \ntrainers also employed methods to transform (i.e. change) the meanings-under-construction in order to \nestablish local legitimacy for the quality template and avoid a de-railing of the change process: for \nexample, by distancing themselves from the idea that they are merely a \u201cmouthpiece\u201d of management (see \n1(a) i.-ii.), by demonstrating their awareness of what the audience might want (see 2(a) i.-v.) and \nattempting to show empathy and solidarity with the audience  (see 3(a) and (b)).  This example of identity \npositioning, i.e. we are \u201cone of you\u201d and \u201con your side\u201d, is an important finding because such subtle \nmaneuvering is, in our view, crucial to the success of the session.  This finding links to Fligstein\u201fs (1997) \nthesis that institutionalization is facilitated by the creative social skills required to \u201cimaginatively \nidentify\u201d with others and Creed, Scully and Austin\u201fs (2002) argument that effective legitimating accounts \nare those which enable recipients to identify with the message.  For example, with regard to \u201cidentity\u201d, \nmembership categorization devices are ways actors choose to describe themselves and others (Potter & \nWetherell 1987: 128-131), which carry with them social and moral implications (i.e. who is a member of \nwhat social group and what responsibilities, expectations, rights and obligations does their membership \ninvolve). For example, the term \u201ewe\u201f may be used to refer to \u201eour membership of the business\u201f to infer a \nset of shared interests, responsibilities and objectives \u2013 namely, tackling the \u201eproblem\u201f of having \u201clost \nmoney\u201d because of failed audits (see 1(b) i. and 2(b) i.-iii.). We show how membership categorization, \nsuch as use of the collective pro-noun \u201cwe\u201d, was used to try to construct a common identity and collective \nresponsibility for ensuring the survival of the business.  The trainers were almost certainly not expected to \ndistance themselves from and criticize the script in order to create a sense of allegiance with the audience \n(see 1(a) i.).  Indeed, a key finding from our analysis is that the dialogue led to a deviation from the \ninstitutionally-preferred meaning of the quality template.  For instance, through creative dialogue around \nthe interests of the audience, the trainers emphasized the potential improvements for the working lives of \nthe audience (e.g., reducing their workload) (see 2(a) i.-v.), thereby potentially undermining the emphasis \n 21 \non protecting the interests of the organization and the coercive institutional pressures towards evidence-\nbased policy in the New Public Management in the UK discussed above.  In Suchman\u201fs (1995) terms, the \nagents employed exchange action (a form of pragmatic legitimacy) when what was called for was \nprocedural action, a form of moral legitimacy.  For us, this deviance  appears logical in this particular \nlocal context and given the dialogue that unfolded.  It is also noteworthy that this \u201cself interest\u201d tactic was \nused as early as two minutes into the training session (see 1(a) i.).  This suggests that the trainers tried to \npre-empt and build-in local adaptations to the meaning of the template that would respond to the local \ncontext of deployment, as opposed to being a merely reactive, face-saving technique designed to \u201crescue\u201d \na bad situation (Goffman 1967) and \u201crespond\u201d to a resistant audience.  \nTwo pertinent points need delineation at this point in time.  First, we do not suggest that the \ntraining session is the only (or even the most important) event in the process of institutionalization of the \nquality template.  While the training session is only one small part of the process of institutionalization, it \nis significant because it represents a critical juncture where the meaning of the quality template (e.g., \nWhat is it? How will it change my working practices? Why should I change my working practices?) is \nnegotiated, and where its acceptance has to be achieved.  In Zbaracki\u201fs (1998: 612-626) \u201cnested\u201d \nVariation-Selection-Retention model, our study addresses retention at the micro level of a work unit.  We \nrecognize that this retention has to be continually established (e.g., in the refresher courses, \ntroubleshooting sessions and project meetings we observed during the remainder of the project) until a \ntemplate becomes taken-for-granted (Berger & Luckman 1967: 53) or, in Beer\u201fs (2003) metaphor, until \nthe seed sinks into the soil.  Our paper is an attempt to answer the call to research what actually happens \n\u201con the ground\u201d.  Our argument is that the quality template did not simply arrive with ready-made \nlegitimacy \u2013 we found that the institutional legitimacy of the DWP audit requirements, plus the \nmanagerial sanctioning of the change, was in fact rejected by the audience - but rather its legitimacy at the \nlocal level was actively \u201cworked up\u201d through creative and situationally-relevant dialogue between the \n\u201cchampions\u201d and \u201crecipients\u201d (Phillips & Hardy 1997; Selznick 1949).  We agree with Suddaby (2009) \nthat rhetorical strategies are a key mechanism for establishing legitimacy.  Second, our argument does not \n 22 \nimply the transmission methods we observed were always effective at ensuring acceptance and enactment \nof the quality template.  For example, we did not interview the audience after the training event to \ninvestigate how the dialogue affected their attitudes to the change and their willingness to put the quality \nidea into practice.  This would furthermore be inconsistent with our methodological approach, which \nviews interviews as situated accounts rather than neutral windows into stable \u201cattitudes\u201d on the inside \n(Potter & Wetherell 1987: 145-155, 163-165).  What our study does reveal is the (discursive) practices of \ndistributed agency and dialogue involved in the transmission of an institutional template.  \nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper we have addressed the question of what actually happens \u201con the ground\u201d when attempts are \nmade to implement an institutionally-demanded template.  We have put forward the twin notions of \ndistributed agency and dialogue in order to analyze the sort of interactional practices involved in \nimplementation.  These concepts, we suggest, answer the call for more research into \u201einstitutional work\u201f, \ni.e. \u201ethe broad category of purposive action aimed at creating, maintaining and disrupting institutions\u201f \n(Lawrence & Suddaby 2006: 216).  Based on detailed analysis of a training session from a qualitative \nstudy in a UK public-private partnership, we highlight the forms of distributed agency and dialogue that \nwe observed when a quality template was implemented through a series of discursive methods, namely \naround voice, identity and interest.  \nAs far as our theoretical contributions are concerned, first and foremost, our study contributes to the \nopening up of \u201ethe black box of diffusion\u201f, as urged by Lawrence and Suddaby (2006: 247) in a recent \nreview of institutional research on organization.  The discussions of institutional transmission to date have \ntended to: portray it as \u201efrictionless\u201f and to \u201egloss over\u2026 substantial institutional work on the part of \norganizational actors who must persuade others in their organizations of the merits of the innovation, \nexperiment with the innovation in an effort to understand it and how it might apply to their own \nsituations, modify it in order to gain internal legitimacy, and forge practical connections for the new \n 23 \nstructure or practice\u201f (Lawrence & Suddaby 2006: 247).  In line with this, we draw attention to the sort of \ninteractional dialogue employed by those involved in transmitting institutions, resulting from their \ncreativity in responding to the agency of the recipients.  Our study uncovered a dialogue around the voice, \ninterest and identity of the audience designed to drive implementation forward and make the template \nmore \u201esocially acceptable and credible\u201f (Weick 1995: 61) and create a \u201enew negotiated group \nunderstanding\u201f (Balogun & Johnson, 2005: 1576).  While this dialogue altered and questioned its \ninstitutionally sanctioned form, this is not a case of failed institutional transmission resulting from the \nunintended consequences that occurred when the quality template met the agency of local audiences.  \nIndeed, a series of follow-up visits showed that the local office in question did indeed implement the new \nquality system and comply with the institutional pressures they faced, though with an element of \n\u201ctinkering\u201d with the details.  Thus, our study shows how dialogue and distributed agency play a role in the \nsuccessful transmission of institutional innovations, albeit in a modified form.  \nSecond, our study enriches the picture of organizational responses to institutionalization (Oliver \n1991).  We suggest that we need to study the discursive processes, for instance during training sessions \nand other such embedding activities, which are involved in the gradual deepening or \u201centrenchment\u201d of \nnew practices (Zeitz, Mittal & McAulay 1999: 743).  In Zbaracki\u201fs (1998) framework, such deepening \nwould happen through the replication of the Variation-Selection-Retention spiral, albeit at lower levels \nand distributed throughout the organization.  We argue that by granting voice to the audience, by \nacknowledging the right to local variation (polyphony), by taking account of their situated interests and \nby addressing and, potentially, re-shaping their identity concerns, a deeper form of adoption is being \nmade possible, whereby the template can become more entrenched.  \nThird, Meyer and Rowan (1977: 341-2) had argued that, under certain circumstances, \norganizations establish loosely-coupled arrangements, where there is a gap between their \u201eblueprint for \nactivities\u201f and their actual work activities.  Insofar as generalized rules might be seen as \u201einappropriate to \nspecific situations\u201f (Meyer & Rowan 1977: 355), some form of de-coupling is likely to ensue.  Instead of \ndecoupling, we suggest that \u201elocally adaptive discursive strategies\u201f (Creed et al 2002: 477) are an \n 24 \nalternative or complementary path that might be taken.  If discursive activities can make a template more \nconvincing to potential adopters, this will therefore facilitate actual implementation.  \nFourth we highlight that both the transformation and the reproduction of structures requires \n\u201eresourceful and innovative human conduct\u201f (Sewell 1992: 27).  Diffusion is hence more likely to involve \n\u201ereinterpretations than recitations\u201f (Creed et al 2002: 476), making it a fundamentally idiosyncratic and \nunpredictable process (Sewell 1992).  Zbaracki (1998: 619), for example, found a quiet, skeptical \nresponse during the TQM selection process, where organization members were kind of \u201ecoerced into \nparticipating in TQM\u201f and, as a result, displayed a degree of dissonance.  We have also built on and \nadvanced the work of these authors by suggesting the concepts of dialogue and distributed agency, which \nenable us to understand the nature and consequences of modifications to institutional templates.  For \nexample, in our study the phrase \u201ewe are just delivering this, we don\u201ft like it\u201f (see Table 1, 1(a) i.) was an \nunexpected, creative method of conducting a training session that embodied both mimesis (\u201ewe\u201fre \ndelivering this\u201f) and difference (\u201ejust\u201f, \u201edon\u201ft like\u201f).  By viewing institutions as constantly and \ncontinuously \u201cin the making\u201d, our approach avoids a compartmentalized view of institutionalization, \naccording to which institutional innovation and change is generated by mechanisms different from those \nthat govern continuity and transmission of institutions.  In contrast, by focusing on the ongoing processes \nof dialogue that create, contest and change institutions, we highlight the similarity between the forces \ninvolved in the creation and evolution of institutions.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank the UK Economic and Social Research Council for funding the research \nupon which this article is based and Dr. Anita Mangan for research assistance in the collection and \ntranscription of the data. \n \n 25 \nREFERENCES \nAbrahamson E (1991) Managerial fads and fashions: The diffusion and rejection of innovations, Academy \nof Management Review 16: 586-612. \nBalogun J and Johnson G (2005) From intended strategies to unintended outcomes: The impact of change \nrecipient sensemaking, Organizational Studies 26: 1573\u20131601. \n \nBarley SR and Tolbert PS (1997) Institutionalization and structuration: Studying the links between action \nand institution, Organizational Studies 18: 93-117. \n \nBeer MS (2003) Why Total Quality Management programs do not persist, Decision Sciences 4: 623-42. \nBeckert J (1999) Agency, entrepreneurs and institutional change: The role of strategic choice and \ninstitutionalized practices in organizations, Organizational Studies 20: 777-799. \nBennet NC, Wise P, Wood J and Harvey A (2003) Distributed leadership, National College for School \nLeadership, accessed at http:\/\/www.ncsl.org.uk\/mediastore\/image2\/bennett-distributed-\nleadership-full.pdf on 19 February 2008.  \nBerger PL and Luckmann T (1967) The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of \nKnowledge, Anchor Books, New York. \nBergstr\u00f6m O and Knights D (2006) Organizational discourse and subjectivity: Subjectification during \nprocesses of recruitment, Human Relations 59: 351-377. \nBoje DM, Oswick C and Ford JD (2004) Language and organization: The doing of discourse, Academy of \nManagement Review 29: 571\u2013577. \nBrint S and Karabel J (1991) The Diverted Dream: Community Colleges and the Promise of Educational \nOpportunity in America, 1900-1985, Oxford University Press, New York. \nBrown JS and Duguid P (1991) Organizational learning and communities of practice: Toward unified \nview of working, learning and innovation, Organization Science 2(1): 40-57. \nBryman A (1988) Quantity and Quality in Social Research, Routledge, London. \nBryman A and Burgess RG (Eds) (1994) Analyzing Qualitative Data, Routledge, London. \nCarlsen A (2006) Organizational becoming as dialogic imagination of practice: The case of the \nIndomitable Gauls, Organization Science 17: 133-149. \nClarke J and Newman J (1997) The Managerial State, Sage Publications, London. \nClarke J, Newman J, Smith N, Vidler E and Westmarland L (2007) Creating Citizen-Consumers. \nChanging Publics and Changing Public Services, Sage Publications, London. \nCreed WED, Scully M and Austin JR (2002) Clothes make the person?
