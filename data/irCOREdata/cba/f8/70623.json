However Maxwell\u2019s classical equations remain manda-\ntory for the description of a vast amount of natural phenomena. This ver-\nsatility is in part due to the supplementary constitutive relations that are\nnecessary to accommodate the wide range of materials that respond to elec-\ntromagnetic fields. Although in principle such relations can be derived from\nthe underlying quantum description of matter, in many practical situations\none must rely on experimental guidance to ascertain the classical response of\nmaterials to such fields.\nOnce the unifying power of a spacetime formulation of physical phenom-\nena became apparent with Einstein\u2019s relativistic world view, the natural\nmathematical tool for describing constitutive responses became the total\nstress-energy-momentum tensor for all matter and fields. Early suggestions\nby Minkowski [1] and Abraham [2] for the structure of its electromagnetic\ncomponent in simple media initiated a long debate involving both theoretical\nand experimental contributions that continues to the current time (see e.g.\n[3]), [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [10], [22], [23]). Although it is widely recognised that\nthis controversy is an argument about definitions [11] and that the relative\nmerits of alternative definitions are undecidable without a complete (experi-\nmentally verifiable) covariant description of relativistic continuum mechanics\nfor matter and fields, it remains important to clarify the many conflicting\narguments that have appeared over the years and to offer new insights that\nmay help in modelling the electromagnetic properties of moving media in the\nabsence of a viable or complete description of field-particle interactions at a\nmore fundamental level.\nSome way towards this goal is offered by (covariant) averaging meth-\nods [18], [17]. These however yield non-symmetric stress-energy-momentum\ntensors for electromagnetic fields in simple media. If the total stress-energy-\nmomentum is to remain symmetric this implies that other asymmetric con-\ntributions must compensate and no guidance is offered to account for such\nmaterial induced asymmetries. The need for a symmetric total stress-energy-\nmomentum tensor is often attributed to conservation of total angular mo-\nmentum despite the fact that such global conservation laws may not exist in\narbitrary gravitational fields. Although the magnitude of gravitational in-\nteractions may be totally insignificant compared with the scale of those due\n1\nto electromagnetism, gravity does have relevance in establishing the general\nframework (via the geometry of spacetime) for classical field theory and in\nparticular this framework [14], [12] offers the most cogent means to define\nthe total stress-energy-momentum tensor as the source of relativistic grav-\nitation. This in turn may be related to a variational formulation [16] of the\nfully coupled field system of equations that underpin the classical description\nof interacting matter in terms of tensor (and spinor) fields on spacetime.\nIn this article stress-energy-momentum tensors are defined as variational\nderivatives and it is argued that the classical properties of a simple polaris-\nable medium may be parameterised in terms of a constitutive tensor whose\nproperties can in principle be determined by experiments in non-inertial (ac-\ncelerating) frames and in the presence of weak but variable gravitational\nfields.\nThere has been a rapid development in recent years in the construction\nof \u201ctraps\u201d for confining collective states of matter on scales intermediate be-\ntween macro- and micro-dimensions. Cold atoms and nano-structures offer\nmany new avenues for technological development when coupled to probes by\nelectromagnetic fields. The constitutive properties of such novel material will\nplay an important role in this development. Space science is also progressing\nrapidly and can provide new laboratory environments with variable gravi-\ntation and controlled acceleration in which the properties of such states of\nmatter may be explored. It will be shown below that the response of elec-\ntromagnetically polarisable media to such novel experimental environments\noffers a means to describe their electromagnetic constitutive properties and\nhence gain insight into the electromagnetic stresses induced by electro-\nmagnetic fields in such media. Supplemented with additional data based\non their mechanical and elasto-dynamic responses one thereby gains a more\nconfident picture of the total phenomenological stress-energy-momentum for\nmedia than that based on previous ad-hoc choices.\nThroughout this article the formulation will be expressed in terms of\ntensor fields on spacetime with an arbitrary metric. Attention will be drawn\nto conservation laws when this metric admits particular symmetries. Thus\nthe results have applicability to simple media in arbitrary gravitational fields\nand accommodate both media and observers with arbitrary velocities.\nAfter establishing some geometric notation, section 2 relates the electro-\nmagnetic 1-forms e,b,d,h to the 2-forms F and G that enter into Maxwell\u2019s\nphenomenological covariant field equations in the presence of matter. Sec-\ntion 3 discusses stress, energy and momentum in the vacuum and introduces\n2\nthe useful notion of a drive form that can be used to calculate electromag-\nnetically induced currents involving the flux of electromagnetic energy, mo-\nmentum and angular momentum in Minkowski spacetime. In section 4 the\ndefinition of the stress-energy-momentum tensor is discussed with particular\nreference to its symmetry based on its role as a source of relativistic grav-\nitation. The constitutive properties of the media considered in this paper\nare delineated in section 5 in terms of a constitutive tensor on spacetime.\nThis includes an account of general magneto-electric continua and leads in\nsection 6 to a formulation of a self-adjoint constitutive tensor describing,\nin general, inhomogeneous, anisotropic, magneto-electric matter in arbitrary\nmotion. The question of an invariant characterisation of magnto-electric me-\ndia is mentioned in section 7. In section 8 an action principle is established\nto generate the phenomenological Maxwell system and the use of variational\nderivatives to calculate stress-energy-momentum tensors is discussed in sec-\ntion 9. The computation of the electromagnetic stress-energy-momentum\ntensor, based on the action of section 8, is non-trivial for general media ex-\nhibiting anisotropy and magneto-electric properties in arbitrary motion and\nis presented in some detail. The relation of this result to tensors proposed\nby Abraham and others is discussed in the concluding section where the\nrelevance of the whole approach to experiments on matter in non-inertial en-\nvironments with variable gravitational and electromagnetic fields is stressed.\nNotations follow standard conventions with spacetime modelled as a 4-\ndimensional, orientable, manifoldM with a metric tensor field g of Lorentzian\nsignature (\u2212,+,+,+). \u0393TM denotes the set of vector fields and \u0393\u039bpM\nthe set of p\u2212form fields on M .

G = j (8)\nwhere F \u2208 \u0393\u039b2M is the Maxwell 2-form, G \u2208 \u0393\u039b2M is the excitation 2-form\nand j \u2208 \u0393\u039b3M is the 3-form electric current source 1. In general, the effects\nof gravitation and electromagnetism on matter are encoded in this system\nin ?G and j. This dependence may be non-linear and non-local. To close\nthis system, \u201c electromagnetic constitutive relations\u201d relating G and j to F\nare necessary. In the following the medium will be considered as containing\npolarisable (both electrically and magnetically) matter with G restricted to\na real point-wise linear function of F , thereby ignoring losses and spatial\nand temporal material dispersion in all frames. Continua endowed with such\nproperties will be termed \u201csimple\u201d here. The electric 4-current j will be\nassumed to describe (free) electric charge and plays no role in subsequent\ndiscussions.\nThe electric field e \u2208 \u0393\u039b1M and magnetic induction field b \u2208 \u0393\u039b1M as-\nsociated with F are defined with respect to an arbitrary unit future-pointing\ntimelike 4\u2212velocity vector field U \u2208 \u0393TM by\ne = iUF and cb = iU?F (9)\n1All tensors in this article have dimensions constructed from the SI dimensions\n[M ], [L], [T ], [Q] where [Q] has the unit of the Coulomb in the MKS system. We adopt\n[g] = [L2], [G] = [j] = [Q], [F ] = [Q]\/ \u00b20 where the permittivity of free space \u00b20 has the\ndimensions [Q2 T 2M\u22121 L\u22123] and c denotes the speed of light in vacuo\n4\nSince g(U,U) = \u22121\nF = e \u2227 U\u02dc \u2212 ? ( cb \u2227 U\u02dc) (10)\nThe field U may be used to describe an observer frame on spacetime and its\nintegral curves model idealised observers.\nLikewise the displacement field d \u2208 \u0393\u039b1M and the magnetic field h \u2208\n\u0393\u039b1M associated with G are defined with respect to U by\nd = iUG , and h\/ c = iU ?

((h\/ c ) \u2227 U\u02dc) (12)\nIt will be assumed that a material medium has associated with it a future-\npointing timelike unit vector field V which may be identified with the bulk\n4\u2212velocity field of the medium in spacetime. Integral curves of V define the\naveraged world-lines of identifiable constituents of the medium. A comoving\nobserver frame with 4\u2212velocity U will have U = V .\n3 Electromagnetic Stress, Energy and Mo-\nmentum in the Vacuum\nThe historical development of Newtonian continuum mechanics led to the\nnotion of a stress tensor in Euclidean 3\u2212space that entered into the balance\nlaws for momentum and angular momentum. With the advent of relativistic\nconcepts this was generalised to a stress-energy-momentum tensor in space-\ntime giving rise to conserved quantities in situations where the metric admits\nsymmetries.\nThe basic properties of the electromagnetic stress-energy-momentum ten-\nsor in the vacuum2 can be succinctly discussed in terms of a set of \u201cdrive\u201d3\u2212forms.\nIn vacuo the Maxwell field system with a 3\u2212form electric current source j\nsatisfies\ndF = 0 and \u00b20 d ? F = j. (13)\n2The notion of a classical vacuum here corresponds to spacetime devoid of all material\n(j = 0) although if j has compact support one can refer to \u201cvacuum domains\u201d where\nj = 0. All regions can admit non-zero electromagnetic and gravitational fields.\n5\nFor any vector field Y on spacetime and any Maxwell solution F to this\nsystem one can introduce a \u201cdrive\u201d 3-form associated with Y and F\n\u03c4EMY =\n\u00b20\n2c\n(iY F \u2227 ?F \u2212 iY ? F \u2227 F ) (14)\nThis 3\u2212form can be used to generate different types of conserved quanti-\nties when the vector field Y generates (conformal) isometries on spacetime.3\nIf K is any (conformal) Killing vector on a domain of spacetime it then follows\nsimply from the vacuum Maxwell-system above that\nd \u03c4EMK = \u2212\n1\nc\niK F \u2227 j (15)\nThus for each (conformal) Killing vector field these equations describe a\n\u201clocal conservation equation\u201d ( d\u03c4K = 0) in a source-free region (j = 0).\nFor K any unit timelike Killing vector one has from (14)\n\u03c4EMK =\n1\nc2\ne \u2227 h \u2227 K\u02dc \u2212 1\n2c\n{ \u00b20 g(e\u02dc, e\u02dc) + \u00b50 g(h\u02dc, h\u02dc)} ?

More precisely\n\u222b\n\u03a3\n\u03c4K is the field\nenergy associated with the spacelike 3-chain \u03a3 and\n\u222b\nS2\niK\u03c4K is the power flux\nacross an oriented spacelike 2-chain S2.\nIf X is a unit spacelike Killing vector generating spacelike translations\nalong open integral curves then with the split:\n\u03c4EMX = \u00b5X \u2227 V\u02dc + GX\nwhere iV GX = 0, the Maxwell stress 2-form \u00b5X may be used to identify\nmechanical forces produced by a flow of field momentum current or pressure\nwith momentum density 3-form GX [19].\nIt is important to stress that different timelike Killing vectors give rise\nto physically distinct notions of conserved energy. For completeness the in-\nterpretation of \u201cenergy\u201d requires further information related to its mode of\n3i.e. In terms of the Lie derivative LY , LY g = \u03bb g for some scalar \u03bb. Y is a Killing\nfield when \u03bb = 0. Angular momentum currents follow in terms Killing vector fields that\ngenerate rotational diffeomorphisms.\n6\ndetection. The existence of timelike parallel Killing vector fields (including\nthose whose integral curves are geodesics) are further conditions that sin-\ngle out particular classes that may have priority in establishing appropriate\nnotions of conserved energy.\nIn general, in the absence of Killing vectors one loses strictly conserved\ncurrents (closed 3\u2212forms) but a set of four local 3\u2212form currents \u03c4EMc \u2261 \u03c4EMXc\ncan be defined in any local coframe. In any frame {Xa} with dual coframe\n{eb} the 16 functions TEMab = iXb ? \u03c4EMa may be used to construct the tensor\nTEM = TEMab e\na \u2297 eb (17)\nusually referred as the stress-energy-momentum tensor associated with the\nabove drive forms 4 .\nThe relationships between any stress-energy tensor T and the associated\ndrive forms \u03c4a are given by\n\u03c4a = ?(T (Xa,\u2212)) and T = ?(\u03c4a \u2227 eb)ea \u2297 eb (18)\nIn terms of the 3\u2212forms \u03c4c the symmetry condition Tbc = Tcb is\nec \u2227 \u03c4b = eb \u2227 \u03c4c (19)\n4 The total stress-energy-momentum tensor\nWhen spacetime contains domains with matter (where j may or may not\nbe zero) such regions will in general have physical properties distinct from\nvacuum domains.\nIf a coupled system of electromagnetic, gravitational and matter fields\nhas a total stress-energy-momentum tensor\nT Total = TEM + Tm+I (20)\nwhere Tm+I describes matter and its interactions not included in TEM , then\non general grounds, if T Total is symmetric, one has:\n\u2207 \u00b7 T Total = 0 (21)\n4In view of the above comments on the role of particular timelike and spacelike Killing\nvectors in constructing conserved energy-power and momentum-force currents a more co-\nherent label for T might be the drive tensor\n7\nin terms of a (Koszcul) connection \u2207 on spacetime. Different authors parti-\ntion the total stress-energy tensor into a sum of partial stress-energy tensors\nin different ways. The divergences of certain partial stress-energy tensors are\nsometimes called pondermotive forces.\nIf the connection \u2207, induced from a connection on the bundle of linear\nframes over spacetime, is both metric compatible and torsion free, with grav-\nitational fields satisfying Einstein\u2019s equations, then T Total must give rise to a\nsymmetric stress-energy tensor T Totalab = T\nTotal\nba . However any such symmet-\nric tensor can be partitioned into non-symmetric partial tensors in infinitely\nmany ways. Such a partition is then an expediency without fundamental\nsignificance.\nIn theories of gravitation based on non-pseudo-Riemannian geometries\nthe natural connection may have torsion. For example in an Einstein-Cartan\ntheory with matter that gives rise to a connection with torsion, the gener-\nalised Einstein tensor EinEC , determined by varying the generalised Einstein-\nHilbert action with respect to orthonormal coframes, is non-symmetric and\nhence the source tensor TEC defined by\nEinEC = TEC (22)\nis similarly non-symmetric. However for some forms of gravitational-matter\ncouplings the variation of the total action with respect to the connection\ngives rise to algebraic equations for the connection.5 In principle these can\nbe solved for the connection which can always be decomposed into a sum\ncontaining the torsion-free metric-compatible (Levi-Civita) connection used\nin Einstein\u2019s pseudo-Riemannian description of gravitation. The generalised\nEinstein tensor EinEC can then be written Ein+ S in terms of the Einstein\ntensor Ein and (22) becomes\nEin = TE (23)\nwhere TE \u2261 TEC \u2212 S is symmetric and divergenceless with respect to the\nLevi-Civita divergence. In such cases one may define the total stress-energy\ntensor as the source tensor for Einstein\u2019s equations (23). It is then by defi-\nnition symmetric. If the natural connection \u2207 (determined by a connection\nvariation of the total action) gives rise to dynamic torsion, determined by a\n5For example, locally SL(2, C) covariant couplings of spinor fields to gravitation fall\ninto this category.\n8\npartial differential system involving all fields, the reduction to a geometrical\nformulation in terms of a metric and Levi-Civita connection becomes an im-\npracticality. In such a situation the definition of the stress-energy tensor is\nbest left as TEC . This has two distinct divergences with respect to \u2207 since\nit is not symmetric.\nSuch general considerations offer guidance in the construction of phe-\nnomenological partial stress-energy tensors based on either coarse-graining\ndetailed interactions between fields or the introduction of effective degrees of\nfreedom [13]. Indeed such phenomenological stress-energy tensors are often\nof greater value than actions based on \u201cfundamental fields\u201d since they can\noften be related more directly to experiment. Thus although in this article\ngravitation will be regarded as a background interaction the electromagnetic\nproperties of a simple medium will be accommodated into certain constitu-\ntive tensors that respond to gravitation. We then demand that an action\ndescribing such a medium in the absence of free charges give rise by vari-\nation to Maxwell\u2019s phenomenological equations for a simple medium and a\nsymmetric stress-energy tensor.\n5 The constitutive tensor for simple media\nIn general G may be a functional of F and properties of the medium6.\nG = Z[F, . . .] (24)\nSuch a functional induces, in general, non-linear and non-local relations be-\ntween d,h and e,b. These relations may be explored either empirically or\nby coarse graining a suitable macroscopic model. For general linear continua\none may have for some positive integer N and collection of constitutive tensor\nfields Z (r) on spacetime the relation\nG = \u03a3Nr=0Z\n(r)(\u2207 rF, . . .)

In this article, for the simple\nlinear media under consideration, we restrict to\nG = Z(F )\n6e.g. electrostriction and magnetostriction arise from the dependence of Z on the elastic\ndeformation tensor of the medium [15].\n9\nfor some constitutive tensor field Z .

However one easily verifies that \u03b6db 6= 0 with respect to any\narbitrary unit timelike V . Hence Z describes an intrinsically magneto-electric\nmedium.\nA minimal set of invariants whose non-vanishing is a necessary and suffi-\ncient condition for a medium to be intrinsically magneto-electric is not known\nto the authors.\n8 Action for Source Free Electromagnetic Fields\nin a Simple Medium\nThe classical equations describing the total system of matter and fields will\nbe considered as arising from the extremum of some total action functional\nunder suitable variations with compact support. This action should be con-\nstructed from an action density 4-form on spacetime in terms of (pull-backs)\nof sections (and their derivatives) of field bundles carrying representations\nof local symmetry (gauge) groups and maps between them. Observed local\nsymmetries in nature arise in such a formalism by ensuring that the action\n4\u2212form is a scalar under local changes of section. To maintain these covari-\nances appropriate connections are required to define tensorial (and spino-\nrial) covariant derivatives of sections. In addition the action may depend on\ntensor-valued functions of these sections. All variational principles require a\nspecification of what objects in the action are to be varied and these then\n14\nconstitute the dynamical variables of the theory. In the following we con-\ncentrate on a contribution \u039b to the total action arising from the effects of\nthe electromagnetic field and gravitation in different types of \u201cmedia\u201d. We\nexclude from this \u039b the interaction with charged matter and the dynamics\nof the gravitational field itself. Included is the effect of the electromagnetic\nfield on a polarisable and magnetisable medium assumed to be described in\nterms of a particular constitutive tensor Z. In particular we explore how\nthe response of the medium to gravitation as well as the electromagnetic\nfield can be used to establish the stress-energy-momentum tensor associated\nwith different choices of constitutive tensor. Thus the action 4-form \u039b will\nbe taken to depend only on the spacetime metric and the class of Maxwell\n1-form potentials A with F = dA. The dependence of the tensor field Z on\nthese variables will be explored in some detail below.\nWe have insisted that in the absence of free charge the electromagnetic\nfields F and G for a simple medium in any spacetime metric must satisfy\ndF = 0 and d ? G = 0 (50)\nBefore generating an electromagnetic stress-energy-momentum tensor from a\nparticular contribution to the total action it is necessary to verify that these\nfield equations arise by suitable variation. Consider then the contribution\nS[A, g] =\n\u222b\nM\n\u039b where F = dA ,G = Z(F ) with Z = Z\u2020 and\nc\u039b = 1\n2\nF \u2227 ?G = 1\n2\nF \u2227 ?Z(F ) (51)\nIf a prime denotes the variation with respect to A, then working modulo d:\nc\u039b\u2032 =1\n2\n(\ndA\u2032 \u2227 ?Z(dA) + dA \u2227 ?Z(dA\u2032)\n)\n=dA\u2032 \u2227 ?Z(dA) = A\u2032 \u2227 d ? Z(dA) = A\u2032 \u2227 d ? G\nHence the source-free Maxwell equations (50) follow by variation with respect\nto A from the action (51). Note that the symmetry condition (45) of the\ntensor Z is essential in this variation.\n9 Variational derivatives and stress-energy-\nmomentum tensors\nTo effect the metric variations of the above action functional let t \u2192 gt be\na curve in the space of Lorentzian signatured metrics, with g0 \u2261 gt|t=0. The\n15\n\u201ctangent\u201d to the the curve t\u2192 gt at the point t = 0 is written g\u02d9:\ngt = g0 + tg\u02d9 +O(t\n2) (52)\nFor a general object K which may be a tensor or a map which depends on\nthe metric g, write similarly t \u2192 Kt as the one parameter set of objects\nencoding the dependence of K on gt, K0 = Kt|t=0 and K\u02d9 = ddtKt|t=0, so\nKt = K0 + tK\u02d9 +O(t\n2) (53)\nKt will be referred to as the metric induced lift of K.\nOne may represent the local variation gt in different ways.

Although natural, the assumptions based on physical consid-\nerations are not, however, necessarily the simplest to make.\nIf Z is chosen to be independent of the metric and hence V\u02dc , with Zt =\nZ0 and Z\u02d9 = 0 so that G = Z0(F ) in all gravitational fields, one obtains\nimmediately from the above variational calculations (72) the drive forms\nc \u03c4a =\n1\n2\n(\nF \u2227 ia ?

(F \u2227 ?G)g (105)\nshowing clearly its independence of the 4-velocity of the medium. It is of\ninterest to note that such a tensor coincides with that obtained by sym-\nmetrising the one proposed by Minkowski.\nIn the absence of a generally accepted relativistic covariant description\nof deformable matter interacting with electromagnetic fields, the adoption\nof a particular stress-energy-momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field\nalone in polarisable (and possible magneto-electric) media must remain a\nmatter of expediency. However, useful models for the total stress-energy-\nmomentum tensor for such systems can benefit from the use of sufficiently\ngeneral phenomenological descriptions of the electromagnetic properties of\nmoving media compatible with relativistic covariance. For example a ther-\nmodynamically inert (pressureless, cold) fluid can be modelled by adding the\nelectromagnetic stress-energy-momentum tensor (96) to the matter stress-\nenergy-momentum tensor m0\nc\u00b20\nN V\u02dc \u2297 V\u02dc where N is a scalar number density\nfield, m0 some constant with the dimensions of mass and V the unit time-\nlike 4-velocity field of the fluid. Supplemented with continuity conditions, the\nvanishing divergence of such a combination yields the dynamics of the sys-\ntem and with prescribed boundary conditions at an interface separating such\nmedia with different properties one may compute bulk forces and torques.\nA review has also been given of the symmetry constraints expected of the\ntotal stress-energy-momentum tensor particularly when this is considered to\n28\nbe a source of relativistic gravitation. This led to a definition in terms of a\nvariational derivative and a consideration of the response of the electromag-\nnetic constitutive properties to gravitational perturbations. It is suggested\nthat stress-energy-momentum tensors parameterised by a self-adjoint consti-\ntutive tensor Z offer a viable means to explore the electromagnetic properties\nof a range of inhomogeneous, anisotropic and possibly magneto-electric con-\ntinua, at least in regions where dispersion and losses can be ignored to a first\napproximation. This formulation suggests a method to determine the prop-\nerties of Z by exploring its phenomenological response to electromagnetic\nfields in arbitrarily moving reference frames and variable gravitational fields.\nIt opens up the possibility of performing such experiments in new environ-\nments such as those carried out under terrestrial free-fall or space station\nsituations or in astrophysical contexts.\nAcknowledgements The authors are grateful D.
