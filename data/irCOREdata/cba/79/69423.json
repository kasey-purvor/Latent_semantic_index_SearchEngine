The tournament has a field of\n65 teams. After an initial play-in game, to reduce the field to 64 teams, there is\na standard knock-out format. See Carlin (1996) for further details. The\nimportance of the the annual tournament is highlighted by CBS paying $6\nbillion for 11 years of TV rights in 1999.\nThe initial field of 65 teams consists of 31 conference champions, and 34 teams\nthat are selected by an NCAA committee. These 34 teams are said to be given\nat-large bids to the tournament, The decision by this committee is announced on\nthe Sunday, known as selection Sunday, a week prior to the start of the\ntournament.\nThe choice of the 34 teams to be given at-large bids is often contentious, with\nmuch media coverage prior to the announcement on selection Sunday (see the\nintroduction of Harville, 2003, for more discussion). The difficulty in choosing\nwho receives the at-large bids comes from the large differences in schedules, and\nthe corresponding strength of opponents, of the different teams in contention.\nThis means that it is not possible to purely compare and order teams based on\ntheir win-loss record. For example in 2009 Arizona, with a win-loss record of\n19\u2212 13 were given a bid, whereas Creighton were not, despite a win-loss record\n2\nof 26\u2212 7. Our results in Section 4 support both these decisions, due to the\nsubstantially more difficult schedule that Arizona played.\nWe shall call the strength of a team\u2019s opponents their strength of schedule. The\naim of this paper is to construct a meaningful measure of a team\u2019s strength of\nschedule that will make it possible to directly compare different teams\u2019 win-loss\nrecords after accounting for the different opponents that they have played. Our\nstrength of schedule is calculated by first considering a fictitious team of a\ncertain standard. We then estimate on average how many games that team\nwould win if they played a specific schedule. This expected number of wins is\nthe strength of that schedule, and is a benchmark against which we can compare\na team\u2019s actual win-loss record. By choosing the standard of this fictitious team\nto be that of a team who is right on the borderline for receiving an at-large bid,\nwe immediately get an indication of which teams have performed well enough to\nreceive an at-large bid: they will have won more games than their strength of\nschedule indicates. Thus we claim this gives a simple, and easily interpretable,\nindication that could guide the decision made on selection Sunday. Calculation\nof each team\u2019s strength of schedule is posssible through applying a statistical\nmodel (Stefani, 1980; Harville and Smith, 1994) to the results of matches in the\ncurrent season.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. We first discuss existing statistics that are\ncalculated for NCAA basketball teams, and outline the difficulties in using these\nto guide selection of teams for at-large bids. We then introduce a simple\nstatistical model for analysing results of basketball matches, and show how this\nmodel can be used to estimate the probability that a team would win a given\nmatch. In Section 3 we then show how we can use this model, fitted to the\ncurrent season\u2019s results, to calculate each team\u2019s strength of schedule. We will\n3\nalso explain why we believe calculating our strength of schedule is more\nappropriate than using other inferences from the fitted model to help guide\nselection of teams for at-large bids. We then analyse data from both the 2007\/08\nand 2008\/09 seasons in Section 4. These suggest that St. Mary\u2019s should have\nreceived a bid to the 2009 tournament instead of Wisconsin, and that Arizona\nState and Nebraska deserved bids to the 2008 tournament in place of South\nAlabama and St. Joseph\u2019s. The paper ends with a discussion.\n2 Current use of statistics\nCurrently a number of statistical summaries of each team\u2019s performance are\ncalculated to help guide which teams have performed best in a given season, and\nthus deserve an at-large bid. One system used to rank teams is the ranking\npercentage index (RPI). Initially it was calculated as a weighted average of\nteam\u2019s winning percentage, their opponents\u2019 winning percentages, and their\nopponents\u2019 opponents\u2019 winning percentages. The weights are 1\/4, 1\/2 and 1\/4\nrespectively. More recently it has been changed slightly to give more weight in a\nteam\u2019s winning percentage to away wins and home losses, and less weight to\nhome wins and away losses.\nThe RPI attempts to take account of both a team\u2019s winning percentage and its\nstrength of schedule, although it does this in a somewhat ad-hoc manner. There\nhave been a number of articles criticising the RPI (see e.g. cheap ticket to the\ndance: systematic bias in college basketball\u2019s rating percentage index, 2007, and\nreferences therein).\nThe RPI is often used to construct further summaries of a team\u2019s performance.\nThis includes reporting a team\u2019s win-loss record against opponents who are\n4\nranked in, say, the top 50 teams based on RPI. Even if the RPI was accurately\ndefining the top 50 teams, there are problems with such summaries. The main\nproblem is that it over-emphasises wins against teams just inside the top 50 as\nopposed to those against teams just outside; and by comparison it ignores the\nwidely differing standards of teams within the top 50. These drawbacks are\ndiscussed in more detail in Section 4.\nRelated to the RPI, is a measure of a team\u2019s strength of schedule based on the\nRPI excluding the team\u2019s own winning percentage. This strength of schedule is\noften reported in terms of its rank relative to all other teams: so it gives\ninformation about which team has had the hardest schedule, the second hardest\nschedule, and so on.\nWe will highlight two problems with this approach to calculating and reporting\nteams\u2019 strength of schedule, both of which will be addressed by our approach to\ncalculating a team\u2019s strength of schedule. The first problem is that the ranking\nof teams does not allow a simple and direct comparison of different team\u2019s\nrecords. For example which record was better in the 2008\/09 season:\nWisconsin\u2019s win-loss record of 19-13 with the 42nd hardest schedule, or St.\nMary\u2019s one of 24-6 with the 118th hardest schedule? Answering this question is\nnot possible without a way of quantifying, in terms of wins\/losses, how much\nharder the first schedule is than the second.\nThe second problem is that the relative strength of different schedules will\ndepend on the ability of the team that is being considered. For example consider\ntwo hypothetical schedules in 2008\/09 each of two games, all at neutral venues:\nthe first involves playing the University of North Carolina and Alcorn State (one\nof the strongest and one of the weakest teams); the other consists of playing\nRutgers (a team ranked in the 100s) twice. For a top 25 team the latter would\n5\nbe easier, with the team likely to win all matches except against North Carolina.\nWhereas for one of the weakest teams the former would be, with the team likely\nto lose all matches except against Alcorn State. Thus if we are calculating\nstrength of schedules to help with the selection of teams for at-large bids, we\nneed to take account of the ability of those teams that will be in contention.\n3 A New Strength of Schedule\nOur approach addresses these two problems by calculating a team\u2019s strength of\nschedule in terms of the expected number of wins a team on the borderline of\nreceiving an at-large bid would get if they played that schedule. We now\ndescribe how we can calculate this. We first present a standard statistical model\nfor basketball data which we will use, and then show how after fitting this model\nwe can calculate each team\u2019s strength of schedule.\n3.1 Modelling and Predicting Basketball Results\nCurrently the NCAA men\u2019s basketball 1st division has 347 teams, with the\nnumber, n, of regular season matches (prior to selection Sunday) being around\n5, 000. Following Stefani (1977, 1980); Harville and Smith (1994); Harville\n(2003), we consider a linear model for the difference in the scores between the\ntwo teams in a basketball match. We assume the teams are numbered,\narbitrarily, from 1 to 347. The model has parameters \u03b2j, j = 1, . . . , 347\ncorresponding to the relative ability of the teams, and \u03b3 which corresponds to\nhome advantage.\nFor match i let the teams be ai and bi, and let zi take the value 1 if team ai is at\n6\nhome, -1 if team bi is at home, and 0 if the match is at a neutral venue. Finally,\nlet yi be team ai\u2019s score less team bi\u2019s score at the end of regulation time. So a\npositive value corresponds to team ai winning, and a negative score corresponds\nto team bi winning, and 0 corresponds to the match entering overtime. Then our\nmodel is, for i = 1, . . . , n,\nyi = \u03b2ai \u2212 \u03b2bi + \u03b3zi + \u03c3\u01ebi, (1)\nwhere \u03c3 is the standard error of the residuals, and we assume that each \u01ebi is a\nrealisation of an independent standard normal random variable.\nIt is not possible to identify all \u03b2s in this model, as adding or subtracting a\nconstant to all the \u03b2s leaves the model unchanged. The interpretation of the \u03b2s\nis in terms of relative strength of teams: so if \u03b2j > \u03b2k, then \u03b2j \u2212 \u03b2k is the\naverage number of points we would expect team j to beat team k by if they\nplayed at a neutral venue. The parameter \u03b3 is the average number of points\nadvantage a team gets by playing at home. Note that we assume a normal\ndistribution for the errors, whereas yi must take integer values. A qq-plot of\nresiduals of the fitted model to the 2008\/09 data suggests that this\napproximation is reasonable, see Figure 1(a). Also, see Harville (2003) for more\ndiscussion on the use of a normal distribution for the errors in the linear model.\nIn constructing our strength of schedule in Section 3.2 we require to make\npredictions from our model. Thus to more naturally incorporate uncertainty in\nthe \u03b2 parameter estimates we use a Bayesian analysis. (There is little\nuncertainty in the estimates of \u03b3 and \u03c3 so we estimate these and treat them as\nfixed when making predictions.) For this we introduce priors for the \u03b2\nparameters. Our choice of prior takes account of information on which\nconference a team belongs to, and allows for differences in the average strength\nof each conference. There are 31 conferences, and we group together all\n7\n\u22124 \u22122 0 2 4\n\u2212\n40\n\u2212\n20\n0\n20\n(a)\nTheoretical Quantiles\nSa\nm\npl\ne \nQu\nan\ntile\ns\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n0.\n0\n0.\n2\n0.\n4\n0.\n6\n0.\n8\n1.\n0\n(b)\nPredicted\nAc\ntu\nal\nFigure 1: Plots of model-fit: (a) Quantile-quantile plot of residuals for the linear\nmodel against a standard normal distribution.

All\nmatches were ranked based on predicted probability of a win, and each set contains\n400 consecutive matches from this ranked list. Dashed lines give approximate 95%\nconfidence intervals calculated from the predicted probabilities.\n8\nnon-conference teams. So we introduce mean conference strengths \u03b7k, for\nk = 1, . . . , 32. We assume that if team j belongs to conference cj then \u03b2j has a\nnormal prior with mean \u03b7k and variance \u03c4\n2\nt ; and we assume normal priors for\n\u03b7cjs with mean 0 and variance \u03c4\n2\nc . The remaining parameters in the model, \u03b3, \u03c3,\n\u03c4c and \u03c4t are estimated by maximising the marginal likelihood.\nOne way of interpreting the priors is that they perform shrinkage. Note that the\npriors include no a priori information about which teams or which conferences\ntend to be stronger. Allowing for the differences in conference strengths is\nimportant because the majority of each team\u2019s matches are within conference,\nand without this structure the priors would over-shrink teams in good, or bad,\nconferences towards 0. The effect of the prior is noticeable when estimating\nparameters mid-way through the season, though has only a minor effect on\nestimates at the end of the season. By introducing this prior we avoid any\nproblems of unidentifiability, and the effect of the prior is to center the estimates\nof the \u03b2s around an average of 0.\nPrevious analyses using this model (e.g. Harville, 2003) have used the resulting\nestimates of the \u03b2s to rank teams. However we argue that using such a ranking\nis not appropriate for choosing which teams should be given at-large bids. The\nreason for this is that the estimates of a \u03b2j will depend only on the opponents of\nteam j and team j\u2019s net points difference in those matches. It does not directly\ndepend on the number of matches that team j wins. However, we would want\nthe choice of teams for the national tournament to be governed by their win-loss\nrecord (after accounting for their opponents). This is natural, as if two teams\nplayed identical schedules you would rank the team who won more matches\nhigher, and not the team with the better net points difference. Also it means\nthat a team\u2019s best strategy in each game is always to try and win the game, such\n9\nas by deliberately fouling to get the ball back towards the end of a game, even if\nthis risks losing by a bigger margin.\n3.2 Calculating the Strength of Schedule\nRather than using the estimates of the linear model (1) directly to rank teams,\nwe instead use them to construct a strength of schedule for each team. This\nstrength of schedule is based on calculating the expected number of matches a\nfictitious team, of fixed ability, would win if they played the schedule. Let the\nstrength of this fictitious team be \u03b20. In order to calculate these strength of\nschedules, we need a way of estimating the probability a team of this strength\nwould have of a winning any specific match.\nConsider a match against team j, and let z be an indicator of which team is at\nhome, defined as above. The linear model (1) gives that the probability that the\nfictitious team would win is\n\u03a6\n(\n\u03b20 \u2212 \u03b2j + \u03b3z\n\u03c3\n)\n, (2)\nwhere \u03a6 is the distribution function of the standard normal distribution. This\nfollows by considering the possible values of the error term in the linear model\nwhich corresponds to the fictitious team scoring more points than team j. Note\nthat this calculation ignores the discrete nature of the difference in scores, and\nthus the possibility of the match entering over-time. However alternative\napproaches, for example based on over-time corresponding to an absolute\ndifference in the two teams\u2019 scores being less than 1\/2 and a subsequent model\nfor the likelihood of each time winning in over-time, give negligible difference\nfrom using (2).\nEmpirically this approach to predicting the probability of wins is supported by\n10\nthe normal qq-plot of the residuals of the linear model, see Figure 1(a). Also, for\nthe actual regular season matches we compared predicted win probabilities of the\nfirst named team in each match, against actual frequency of wins. We calculated\nboth mean predicted probability and frequency for sets of 400 matches. The sets\nof matches were obtained by first ranking the matches in terms of the predicted\nprobability of a win, and then each set contains 400 consecutive matches from\nthis list. This ensures that each set contains matches with similar predicted win\nprobabilities. A plot of actual against predicted is shown in Figure 1(b), and\nshows the actual frequency to almost always lie within approximate 95%\nconfidence regions obtained from the predicted probabilities.\nWe cannot directly use (2) as it depends on unknown parameters \u03b2j, \u03b3 and \u03c3.\nOur approach is to plug in our estimates of \u03b3 and \u03c3, and then average over the\nposterior distribution for \u03b2j, given the data from all regular season matches.\nNote that the posterior for \u03b2j can be calculated analytically, and the expectation\nover the posterior can be done numerically.\nTo calculate a teams strength of schedule, for a given \u03b20, we just sum these\nexpected win probabilities for each of the matches that that team played. We\ncan also estimate the posterior variance of the probability (2) for each match,\nand this can be used to determine an approximate standard error for the\nestimate of a team\u2019s strength of schedule.\nAs described above, our strength of schedule for each team will depend on \u03b20.\nThe relative value of each team\u2019s strength of schedule will depend on this choice.\nFor example in the limit as \u03b20 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, each strength of schedule will tend to 0\nexpected wins, whereas as in the limit as \u03b20 \u2192\u221e the expected number of wins\nwill tend to the number of games played. As we are interested in distinguishing\nbetween teams on the borderline for receiving an at-large bid, it is most\n11\nappropriate for \u03b20 to be chosen to be similar in value to the value of \u03b2 for such a\nteam. In practice our approach is to choose \u03b20 such that exactly 34\nnon-conference champions have more wins than the expected number of wins\ngiven by their strength of schedule. These 34 teams are thus the ones which this\napproach suggests should be given at-large bids. In practice, small variations\naround this value make little impact on the rankings of the teams.\n4 Results\nWe now analyse data from both the 2007\/08 and 2008\/09 regular seasons. In\nboth cases we obtained results of all matches between first division teams from\nESPN\u2019s website (http:\/\/espn.go.com\/mens-college-basketball\/). First we\npresent results of the analysis for the 2008\/09 season, with a focus on the issues\nwe have raised above about how informative are different summaries of a team\u2019s\nresults. We then give the results and intepretation for the two seasons, focussing\nspecifically on the choice of teams for at-large bids. Full results from these two\nseasons are available from\nhttp:\/\/www.maths.lancs.ac.uk\/\u223cfearnhea\/Basketball.html\n4.1 Summaries of Teams\u2019 Results\nFor the 2008\/09 season the posterior mean estimates of the \u03b2s ranged from\n\u221222.7, for the N.J.I.T. to 23.1 for the University of North Carolina. The size of\nhome advantage, \u03b3, was estimated at 3.5 points, and the standard deviation of\nthe residuals was 10 points. The latter two are similar to the estimates from the\n1999-2000 season in Harville (2003).\n12\nRank Team \u03b2j Win Prob.

Rank gives the rank, in terms\nof the posterior mean of the \u03b2js, among teams that did not win their conference\nchampionship. Win Prob. gives the predicted win probability of a fictious team:\n(1) corresponds to a team with \u03b20 = 11.8, and (2) to one with \u03b20 = \u221211.8.\nColumns H, A, and N correspond to a home, away and neutral match for the\nfictitious team.\nA small selection of teams, and corresponding estimated \u03b2js are given in Table\n1. This table also gives the predicted probability that two fictitious teams would\nwin a match against each of these teams. The first of these teams is chosen to be\nof a standard comparable to a team on the borderline of getting a bid \u2013 and is\nthe standard of team we use in calculating strength of schedules below. The\nsecond team is chosen to be of a standard comparable to one of the weaker\ndivision I teams.\nThe results in Table 1 help us to quantify how the strength of schedule depends\non the ability of the fictitious team. For the pair of two match schedules\nsuggested in Section 2, a strong fictious team (\u03b20 = 11.8) would expect to win\n13\n1.22 games against North Carolina and Alcorn State, and 1.66 games if they\nplayed Rutgers twice. By comparison a weaker team (\u03b20 = \u221211.8) would win on\naverage 0.82 matches for the first schedule, but only 0.16 for the second. Thus\nthe ability of the team we consider can even effect not only the absolute\ndifficulty of each schedule, but even which schedule is easier.\nThe results in Table 1 also highlight how the importance of home advantage\ndepends on the relative ability of the two teams. For comparable team, such as\nthe stronger fictitious team and Kansas State, playing at home as opposed to\nplaying away can increase the probability of winning by over a quarter. For very\ndisparate teams, such as the stronger fictitious team and Alcorn State, it has\nnegligible effect. By comparison, one disadvantage of the way that the RPI\naccounts for home-advantage is that it quantifies its effect equally for all\nmatches.\nFrom Table 1 we see the problem of using the estimates of the \u03b2js to rank teams\nfor inclusion in the national tournament. Neither Georgetown nor Kansas State\nrecieved bids for the tournament in 2009, whilst Dayton did. In total these\nrankings gave 9 teams in the top 34 non-conference champions that did not\nreceive bids to the tournament. The reason for this disparity is that the\nestimates of the \u03b2js are based on point-differences in matches and not just the\nresults of those matches. So teams like Georgetown had few wins given their net\npoint-difference in the matches they played.\nFinally, we also see that there is a much larger difference between the estimate of\n\u03b2j for North Carolina and Georgetown, as compared to that between\nGeorgetown and either LSU or even Dayton. This highlights the problem of\nsummaries based on win-loss records against top-50 teams, as it ignores the\nsubstantial difference in difficulty of a match against a team like North Carolina,\n14\nas opposed to one like Georgetown. The biggest differences in ability of teams is\nwithin roughly the top-10 teams, and there is comparably little difference\nbetween teams ranked just within or just outside the top-50.\n4.2 2008\/09 Season\nWe now focus on the estimated strength of schedules for teams from the 2008\/09\nseason, and the information they give about who deserved at-large bids to the\nnational tournament. We calculated strength of schedule for all teams, and we\ngive results for a subset of teams in Table 2. Here we focus on teams ranked by\nthe difference in their actual win percentage and the win percentage given by\ntheir strength of schedule. We excluded conference champions, and give results\nfor the teams close to position 34 \u2013 the borderline for receiving an at-large bid.\nAs described in Section 3, we fixed the ability of the fictitious team to such that\n34 non-conference champions won more matches than their strength of schedule.\nThis corresponded to \u03b20 = 11.8. We also quantified the uncertainty in the\nestimates of the strength of schedule, through estimating the posterior variance\nof the predicted win probability for each match. To summarise these, we\ncalculated the average variance in the estimate of the strength of schedules for\nall teams. This average variance is 0.088. This suggests that estimates of\nstrength of schedules are accurate to within plus or minus 0.6, based on twice\nthe corresponding standard error.\nThe 34 non conference champions who won more games than their strength of\nschedule (see Table 2) contain two teams not given at-large bids to the national\nchampionship. These were St. Mary\u2019s and San Diego State, with Michigan and\nWisconsin receiving bids instead.

Rank is based on the difference of actual win\npercentage and win percentage of the strength of schedule (SOS). In calculating\nthe rank we have exclude all conference champions. Thus teams our results on the\nleft should have receved an at-large bid, and those on the right should not have.\nTeams who actually received an at-large bids are marked by \u2217. SOS is given in\nterms of the predicted number of wins.\n16\nMichigan was very close, the former\u2019s strength of schedule was 0.2 less than the\nnumber of games won, and the latter\u2019s was 0.1 more. These are both\ncomfortably within the margin of error of the estimates of the strength of\nschedule, which was 0.6.\nHowever there appears to be clear evidence that St. Mary\u2019s should have been\npreferred to Wisconsin for an at-large bid. The omission of St. Mary\u2019s from the\nnational championship could be explained by an injury to one of their players,\nPaddy Mills, near the end of season, and resulting uncertainty over whether he\nwould be fully fit for the championship. However, even allowing for this, the\nresults in Table 2 suggest that teams other than Wisconsin should have been\ngiven a bid instead.\n4.3 2007\/08 Season\nWe now repeat the analysis for the 2007\/08 season and results are given in Table\n3. We again estimate the margin of error of the strength of schedules as twice\nthe estimated standard error, and this is 0.6.\nThis time there are 4 teams who have won more games than their SOS, but who\nwere not given at-large bids. All four teams had the difference between their\nnumber of wins and their strength of schedule at or within our estimated margin\nof error. Of the four teams who received at-large bids instead, Mississippi State\nwere on the borderline: ranked 35th among non-conference champions and with\ntheir number of wins equal to their strength of schedule. Kentucky had\nperformed poorly early in the season, due to injury problems, but had performed\nmuch better during the second half of the season (12-4 in the SEC). It is likely\nthat the early season injury problems were taken into account in the decision to\n17\ngive them an at-large bid.\nHowever our results suggest that the other two teams, South Alabama and St.\nJoseph\u2019s were fortunate to receive bids. In particular St. Joseph\u2019s won 21\nmatches with a strength of schedule of 22.7, suggesting that they required 2\nextra wins to warrant an at large bid. To look into this further we compare the\nschedules of St. Joseph\u2019s with that of Arizona State, who won 19 matches with a\nstrength of schedule of 18.4 but were not given an at-large bid. The schedules,\ntogether with the win probabilities that are used to calculate the strength of\nschedule are given in Table 4.\nThe argument against Arizona State is that they had \u201cRPI in the 80s,\nnonconference SOS in the 300s, a 9-9 league record and 5-10 in its last 15\nmatches\u201c Glockner (2008). By comparison St. Joseph\u2019s RPI rank was 44 (see\nhttp:\/\/kenpom.com\/rpi.php). Arizona State\u2019s record against top-50 RPI\nteams was 5-7, and St. Josephs\u2019s was 5-6.\nOne of the main aspects of the argument for preferring St. Joseph\u2019s is their\nbetter RPI rating. However, Arizona State\u2019s RPI is severely affected by the\nmatches they played against weak teams. If you remove the 10 easiest matches\nfrom their schedule, then their RPI would improve to about 50th \u2013 despite the\nfact they won all 10 of these matches. Also whilst St. Joseph\u2019s record against\ntop-50 RPI teams is marginally better, looking at Table 4 we can see that on\naverage their matches against top-50 opponents were easier than Arizona\nState\u2019s. The overall expected number of wins for St. Joseph\u2019s against their\ntop-50 opponents is 5.3, whereas Arizona State\u2019s is just 3.7.\n18\nRank Team W-L SOS Rank Team W-L SOS\n27 Davidson\u2217 25-6 24.2 35 Mississippi St.\u2217 22-10 22.0\n28 Oregon\u2217 18-13 17.2 36 New Mexico 24-8 24.1\n29 Arizona St. 19-12 18.4 37 Mississippi 21-10 21.3\n30 Arkansas\u2217 22-11 21.6 38 Syracuse 19-13 19.6\n31 Nebraska 19-12 18.7 39 South Alabama\u2217 25-6 25.8\n32 Villanova\u2217 20-12 19.7 40 Creighton 21-10 21.8\n33 Illinois St. 23-9 22.8 45 Kentucky\u2217 18-12 19.2\n34 Ohio State 19-13 18.9 50 St. Joseph\u2019s\u2217 21-12 22.7\nTable 3: Results for 2007\/08 season. Details are the same as in Table 2.\n5 Discussion\nWe have presented a method for calculating a team\u2019s strength of schedule in\nterms of an expected number of wins. This gives a benchmark performance with\nwhich to compare a team\u2019s actual results, and has been constructed so that if a\nteam wins more games than their strength of schedule, that is evidence that\nthey deserve a bid to the national tournament.\nWe think this approach has advantages over existing methods for ranking teams,\nor summarising their performances. The strength of schedule is interpretable,\nand enables a quick comparison between the performance of different teams after\ntaking account of the schedules that they have each played. It enables teams to\nbe ranked in terms of their win-loss records, as opposed to methods that are\ninfluenced by winning margins. Furthermore, we can assess uncertainty in our\nestimate of the strength of schedule, so we can not only highlight the 34 teams\nmost deserving of bid but also suggest which teams have demonstrated clear\n19\nArizona State St. Joseph\u2019s\nOpponent Res.

For teams whose season has been affected by injuries, such as\nKentucky in 2007\/08, we can break the strength of schedule down into subsets of\nmatches and thus look directly at how a team has performed at different stages\nof the season. As such we believe this strength of schedule would help inform\ndecisions as to which teams are given bids to the national tournament.\nReferences\nCarlin, B. P. (1996).
