(Forthcoming Political Studies 2008) \n \nThe Animal Welfare Act, which came into effect in England and Wales in April 2007, \nhas imposed upon the owners and keepers of animals a \u2018duty of care\u2019 to ensure that \nthe interests of their animals are met.  Thus it is no longer sufficient that individuals in \nEngland and Wales refrain from beating their animals, or refrain from acting in other \nintentionally cruel ways towards them.  Rather, owners must also take certain positive \nsteps to ensure the well-being of their animals: to provide suitable housing; to provide \nadequate food; to offer protection from pain; and to offer the opportunity of expressing \nnormal behaviour.  The focus of the Act is thus animals and their interests, rather than \nhumans and their cruel behaviour.  As such, the Act encapsulates the idea that we \nhave obligations to sentient animals in their own right, based on their own interests, \nand not simply because we disapprove of humans who act maliciously towards them.  \nOf course, if legislation concerning animals is to be based on the interests of animals \nthemselves, it is crucial that we have a good understanding of what those interests \nare.  The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this task by asking whether animals \nhave an interest in liberty.  This question is particularly important because many \nthinkers and campaigners take the view that animals possess an intrinsic interest in \nliberty.i  In other words, it is argued that liberty is good for animals in itself, irrespective \nof its contribution to and facilitation of other goods.  Hence, those writing and \ncampaigning for justice for animals often argue that the practices of zoos, circuses, \nanimal experiments, animal agriculture and even pet-keeping necessarily harm \nanimals.  So in their view, these practices should not simply be regulated, say to help \nalleviate suffering as seems to be the goal of the Animal Welfare Act.  Instead, such \npractices must be abolished, and the animals involved liberated.  In this sense then, \nusing and keeping animals might be considered analogous to human slavery \n(Francione, 1996, p. 127).  For human slavery causes harm not just because of the \npain and suffering it inflicts, but because it violates the intrinsic human interest in \nliberty.  Thus, the problems of slavery could not be legislated away by ensuring that \nslave-owners acted with a \u2018duty of care\u2019; rather, slavery as an institution had to be \nabolished.   \n  In my view, it is reasonably easy to see why some people hold the belief that animals \npossess an intrinsic interest in liberty.  After all, many of us, when we are confronted \nwith animals in confinement, have an intuitive reaction of distaste.  For example, \nseeing animals locked up in zoos, performing tricks in circuses, or constrained in \n 2 \nresearch laboratories and battery cages makes many of us feel uneasy.  Isn\u2019t it better \nthat animals live their lives freely in the wild as nature intended?  If you are an \nindividual with these types of intuitions, the notion that animals have an intrinsic \ninterest in liberty will be appealing.  However, relying solely on our feelings like this is \nnot good enough to decide the matter.  For one thing, and as we see around us, \ndifferent people have quite different reactions to such practices.  Furthermore, while \nwe might feel uneasy by the confinement of animals, that does not mean that the \nanimals themselves are averse to their situation; and surely the feelings of the \nanimals themselves must have some bearing as to what can be said to be in their \ninterests or not.  Finally, those of us who have this negative reaction to seeing animals \nin zoos, circuses, laboratories and battery cages, must ask whether it is based on the \nfact that the animals are confined, or on the fact that the animals in these situations \nare suffering.  That fewer of us have a negative reaction to other confined animals \nwho do not usually suffer, such as pets and those in wildlife parks, at least suggests \nthat our responses might turn on whether an animal is suffering or not, rather than \nliberty itself.   \n  In this paper I argue that most animals do not have an intrinsic interest in liberty.  \nInstead, I claim that most animals only have an instrumental interest in liberty; that is, \nit is dependent on its facilitation of other goods, such as the avoidance of suffering.  \nTo support this argument, the paper is divided into five sections.  In the first two \nsections of the paper, I briefly spell out what it means for an entity to have an interest, \nand then what it means to have an interest in liberty.  In this latter section, I argue that \nmost adult humans possess an intrinsic interest in liberty because they have the \ncapacity to be \u2018autonomous agents\u2019.  That is, they possess the ability to frame, revise \nand pursue their own conceptions of the good.  In the third section, I evaluate whether \nnon-human animals might also be said to be autonomous and draw upon Tom \nRegan\u2019s notion of \u2018preference autonomy\u2019.  I claim that even if we grant preference \nautonomy to animals, it does not ground in them an intrinsic interest in liberty.  In the \nfourth section, I examine the argument that animals have an intrinsic interest in liberty \nbecause exercising their species-specific \u2018natural functionings\u2019 is crucial to their well-\nbeing.  I refute this claim, arguing that it unjustifiably takes a perfectionist view of \nanimals and their lives.  In the final section, I outline the important implications of this \nargument for our moral and political obligations to non-human animals.  Here I claim \nthat while our obligations to animals might well be pressing \u2013 and certainly more \npressing than any state currently legislates for \u2013 they do not necessarily include the \nliberation of animals.    \n \n 3 \nWhat Does \u2018Having an Interest\u2019 Mean?  \nJoel Feinberg has famously argued that to have an interest in x is to have some kind \nof stake in x; and to have a stake in x is to stand to gain or lose depending on the \ncondition of x (Feinberg, 1984, pp. 33-34).  Of course, this raises the question as to \nwhat \u2018to gain or lose\u2019 means.  For Feinberg, it means that one\u2019s well-being is affected \nby x\u2019s condition.  That is to say, an individual\u2019s life goes better or worse as a result of \nthe state of x.  As Feinberg himself puts it: \nThese interests\u2026are distinguishable components of a person\u2019s well-being: he \nflourishes or languishes as they flourish or languish.  What promotes them is to \nhis advantage or in his interest; what thwarts them is to his detriment or against \nhis interest (Feinberg, 1984, p. 34).  \nUnder this conception then, an interest is a component of an individual\u2019s well-being.  If \nwe accept this view - and it certainly seems perfectly plausible - in order to determine \nwhether animals have an interest in liberty, we must ask whether liberty makes life go \nwell for them.  This, of course, leads us to the question of what well-being is.  \n  It is crucial to note at the outset that well-being is what is often called a prudential \nvalue (Crisp, 2003; Sumner, 1996, p. 20).  That is to say, well-being relates to how \nwell things are going for the individual whose life it is.  Prudential values can thus be \ndistinguished from aesthetic, perfectionist and ethical values (Sumner, 1996, pp. 20-\n25).  For example, it might be said that something is beautiful (of aesthetic value), a \ngood specimen of its kind (of perfectionist value), or even the right thing to do (of \nethical value), but in making such judgments we need make no reference to how \nthings are for the relevant entities themselves.  Well-being, on the other hand, is a \nprudential value because something can only promote an entity\u2019s well-being if it is \nbeneficial for that entity itself.  Put another way, I may lead a life that is devoted to \nlooking beautiful, being a perfect example of a member of the species Homo sapiens, \nor doing the morally upstanding thing in every situation, but it is an open question \nwhether any of these states of affair are valuable for me.  For while these lives may be \nof some value, it not evident that they are of prudential value.   \n  I should point out that none of this assumes that well-being can only ever be \nassessed by the individual him or herself, or that the individual is always right in such \nassessments.  It is perfectly possible for an objective account of well-being to \nrecognise that well-being is a prudential value, but maintain that it is best measured in \nrelation to certain definitive goods.  For example, it might perhaps be claimed that \nindividuals in extreme poverty can be duped or conditioned into thinking that their lives \nare going well, when not even their basic needs are being met.  Here, it might be \nargued, is a case where an assessment of well-being can be made in relation to \n 4 \nobjective criteria such as need-satisfaction, but that is nevertheless concerned with \nhow life is going for individuals themselves. \n \nWhat is an Interest in Liberty? \nNow that we have established a very basic idea of what it means for an individual to \nhave an interest, we next need to consider what it means to have an interest in liberty.  \nLiberty, or freedom (and I use the terms interchangeably), is a concept that is used \ndifferently by different thinkers.  Nevertheless, I want to outline three of the most well-\nknown understandings of the term and what it means to have an interest in each. \n  Isaiah Berlin famously distinguished between negative and positive conceptions of \nliberty (Berlin, 1967).  Negative liberty usually refers to being free from interference \nand constraints.  Thus in order to have an interest in negative liberty, one\u2019s life must \ngo better when one is not interfered with.  Positive liberty, on the other hand, is not \nabout the absence of constraints, but the presence of control (Taylor, 1991).  In other \nwords, positive liberty usually refers to an individual\u2019s ability to control his or her own \nlife: to self-govern and to self-rule.  Thus in order to have an interest in positive liberty, \none\u2019s life must go better for being in control of it.  Finally, republican liberty refers to \nthe absence of domination (Pettit, 1997).  To explain this type of freedom, consider a \nbenevolent slave-owner who does not interfere in the life of his slave.  Under a purely \nnegative conception, this slave would be considered to be free.  However, because \nthe master has the ability to interfere in the life of the slave whenever and however he \nwishes, but simply chooses not to, republican thinkers argue that the slave is \ndominated and is unfree as such.  To have an interest in republican liberty, one\u2019s life \nmust go better when one is not dominated by the threat of arbitrary interference by \nanother.   \n  Whichever conception is adopted, most people consider freedom to be an absolutely \nfundamental interest of human beings; but on what basis?  While various arguments \ncan be put forward endorsing the centrality of liberty to human well-being, there are \ntwo different types of account which have the most plausibility (Rachels, 1976).  The \nfirst type sees liberty purely as an instrumental good, valuable only insofar as it \ncontributes to a separate intrinsic good such as pleasure or the pursuit and \nsatisfaction of preferences.  The other type, which I will claim is the more plausible \naccount, sees liberty as having intrinsic value in its own right.  In this section, I briefly \nexamine and refute two different instrumental accounts, before outlining and \ndefending the view that most humans have an intrinsic interest in liberty. \n  First of all then, one can claim that liberty is crucial to human well-being because it \nmakes their lives more enjoyable.  For example, human beings often get annoyed and \n 5 \nfrustrated when they are interfered with, receive considerable satisfaction from being \nthe authors of their own lives, and take pleasure from the fact that they are not \ndominated by another individual or group.  This explanation of the human interest in \nliberty is in keeping with hedonistic classical utilitarianism, which accounts for well-\nbeing solely in terms of the absence of suffering and the presence of pleasure.  Under \nthis account, liberty is an instrumental interest of human beings, valuable only insofar \nas it promotes pleasure and alleviates suffering.  However, as many critics have \npointed out, this explanation of the human interest in liberty is far from satisfactory.  In \nparticular, it has been argued that by making the interest contingent on pleasure, \ninsufficient weight is given to the value of liberty itself for human lives.  For example, \nconsider the case of Truman Burbank in the film The Truman Show.  Truman has a \nvery pleasurable life with good friends and a loving wife.  However, little does he know \nthat his life is being filmed for a television show, and that his friends and wife are \nactors.  Truman\u2019s life is pleasurable, but he lacks liberty.  Truman lacks liberty in all \nthree senses of the term outlined: he is interfered with; he lacks control of his own life; \nand he faces the threat of arbitrary interference from others.  Importantly for our \npurposes, most of us would consider that Truman\u2019s life is not a good life for him, \nprecisely because he lacks such liberty.  While there is a very strong possibility that \nrevealing the truth to Truman would make his life less pleasurable, we still believe that \nit is in his interests to be enlightened.  This is because most of us consider that there \nis something harmful about others controlling and manipulating an individual\u2019s life in \nthis way, even if it results in more overall pleasure.  Such an example suggests that \nliberty is valuable not merely in terms of its facilitation of pleasure, but is a more \nfundamental good for human beings.   \n  Perhaps the importance of liberty is better reflected by the preference-based \nexplanation of the human interest in liberty.  This argument claims that liberty is \nvaluable to humans because it enables them to pursue and satisfy their desires.  This \naccount has a great deal of intuitive appeal on the basis that being able to pursue \ndesires is usually considered to be a good thing for humans, and freedom usually \nfacilitates this.  For example, non-interference provides us space to pursue and satisfy \nour preferences; what seems to appeal about self-mastery is the ability to achieve \nwhat we want; and part of the problem with domination is the threat of having our \npreferences limited and quashed arbitrarily.  On this account, liberty is valuable \ninsofar as it facilitates the pursuit and realisation of our preferences.   However, when \nwe dig just a little bit deeper, we see that this preference-based account of the human \ninterest in liberty is unconvincing.  Once again, it is clear that by making the interest in \nliberty contingent upon the pursuit and satisfaction of preferences, such an account \n 6 \ngrants insufficient weight to the value of liberty itself for human lives.  For example, \nconsider an individual who is raised as a slave.  Imagine further that the individual is \nbrought up so that she thinks of her life as being of less worth than that of her master, \nand overwhelmingly desires to serve him.  Clearly, the slave is able to pursue and \nsatisfy her desires, despite the fact that she lacks liberty.  But even though liberating \nthe slave would be against her wishes, most of us consider that it is nevertheless in \nher interests to be free.  This is because we consider the value of liberty for a human \nlife to trump simple preference satisfaction in this case.  Once again, this suggests \nthat the interest we have in liberty is not simply dependent on its promotion of \npreference satisfaction, but is a more fundamental good. \n  At this point, some might argue that it is possible to alter these instrumental accounts \nto deal with such problems.  For example, we might say that humans have an interest \nin liberty only insofar as liberty promotes the pleasure of a self-governing subject \n(Sumner, 1996), or only insofar as it facilitates the satisfaction of freely-chosen \npreferences (Brandt, 1979; Griffin, 1986; Harsanyi, 1982).  Such changes would allow \nus to deal more satisfactorily with the examples of The Truman Show and the slave.  \nFor we could say that Truman should have the truth revealed to him, because \nalthough he is happy he is not self-governing; and that the slave should be liberated, \nbecause although she is satisfying her preferences, they were not freely chosen.  \nHowever, by making such amendments, these accounts make an important \nconcession.  That is to say, after each account is altered, the relevant intrinsic good is \nno longer mere pleasure or mere preference satisfaction; instead, liberty itself is \nrecognised to be of intrinsic value.  In other words, these accounts only become \nplausible when they are altered to acknowledge the central importance of liberty itself \nfor the lives of human beings.  Given this, it seems that the instrumental explanations \nof the human interest in liberty cannot tell us the whole story; at least part of the \nhuman interest in liberty must be explained by the fact that it is of intrinsic value to \nhuman beings.  But what arguments can be given to show that the human interest in \nliberty is intrinsic? \n  I wish to argue that liberty itself is of intrinsic value to most human beings, because \nmost human beings are \u2018autonomous agents\u2019.  Now although autonomy is a \nsomewhat contested concept, autonomy usually relates to the following: the capacity \nto frame, revise and pursue one\u2019s own conception of the good.  Autonomy thus relates \nto something more than the mere ability to pursue and satisfy desires.  It refers to the \ncapacity to reason and reflect on those desires, and change them in relation to one\u2019s \nvalues and conception of the good (Dworkin, 1988, p. 108).  In other words, autonomy \nrefers to a \u2018second-order\u2019 capacity pertaining to the choice and pursuit of one\u2019s own \n 7 \nconception of the good.  My claim is that it is this capacity for autonomy which \nexplains why most human beings possess an intrinsic interest in liberty.  To explain, \nlet us return once again to the examples which undermined the argument that liberty \nis only of instrumental value.  In his life, Truman lacked liberty.  However, the problem \nwith this was not that it made him unhappy or stood in the way of his preferences; \nafter all, he was happy and could satisfy his desires.  Rather, the problem was that he \nwas unable to frame and pursue his own life plans.  His ambitions and opportunities \nwere limited and determined by the television programme of which he was unwittingly \na part.  Similarly, the contented slave who was brought up to serve her master lacked \nliberty.  While she could follow her desires and satisfy them, she was dominated and \nlacked control of her own life.  Once again, the problem with this lack of liberty was \nnot that it made her unhappy or frustrated her desires; for plainly, it did not.   The \nproblem was that the slave lacked the freedom to frame and pursue her own \nconception of the good.  Her choices and ambitions were limited and determined by \nher master.  In both cases, it was in these individuals\u2019 interests to have the freedom to \nframe, revise and pursue their own ends because they are autonomous agents.  On \nthis basis, it is my claim that freedom is of intrinsic importance to the well-being of all \nthose with the capacity for autonomy.      \n  Of course, liberty may be an intrinsic good of most humans, but that does not mean \nthat in order to live well human beings must live radically free lives, with no constraints \non, and full control over, every option in life.  For one thing, the extent of an \nindividual\u2019s freedom must certainly be limited so that it does not impinge on the \nfreedom of others.  Moreover, one can think of many examples where it is better to \ninterfere with humans and act paternalistically towards them: addicts, children and the \nmentally disabled being good cases in point.  But such examples are easily explained \nby the simple fact that such individuals lack the capacity for autonomy: they are not in \nfull command of the options in their life.  For humans who do possess the capacity for \nautonomy, on the other hand, there is surely always a presumption against \npaternalism when their freedom does not impinge on others.  And even though some \npeople will want to choose lives involving interference and will want to devolve \nauthority over certain options in that life, this does not count against recognising the \nvalue of liberty for individuals.  For the value of liberty for human beings is not \nperfectionist; that is, it does not require us all to lead the same type of radically free \nlives.  Instead, its value is prudential, simply noting that it is up to individuals \nthemselves whether to choose interference or devolve authority over options in their \nlives.  In sum, my claim is that autonomous individuals have an intrinsic interest in \nbeing unconstrained, self-governing, and non-dominated agents.   \n 8 \n  So much for the interest in liberty concerning human beings.  What the next two \nsections of the paper are concerned with is whether animals share this intrinsic \ninterest in liberty. \n \nAnimals and the Argument from Autonomy \nI have claimed that the intrinsic interest in liberty that humans possess is founded \nupon their autonomous agency.  Now we need to consider whether the argument from \nautonomy can be applied to animals.  To do this, we need to ask whether any animals \nare autonomous agents in the way that I have defined the term.  You will recall that I \ndefined autonomy as the capacity to frame, revise and pursue a conception of the \ngood.  Do any non-human animals possess such a capacity?   \n  In the first place, it will be useful to rule out as possessors of autonomous agency \nthose animals that lack any conscious experience at all.  For in order to be able to \nhave goals and pursue them, let alone reflect on them, some conscious experience \nwill undoubtedly be necessary.  While it is hard to be certain exactly which kinds of \nentity have conscious experience and which do not, most writers on the topic \u2013 and \nmany animal welfare laws - agree that a significant line can be drawn between \nvertebrates who possess complex central nervous systems, and invertebrates who do \nnot (DeGrazia, 1996, p. 111; Rowlands, 2002, p. 22; Garner, 2005, p. 29).  Thus the \nphysiological structure of animals such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and \nfish strongly suggests that they have the capacity for conscious experience, whereas \nthat of insects, molluscs, crustaceans, arachnids and so on, suggests that they do not.  \nGiven this, let us concentrate on vertebrates.  These animals are very likely to \npossess the capacity for conscious experience, which is often taken to be \nsynonymous with \u2018sentience\u2019, the capacity to feel pleasure and pain.  Can such \nanimals be said to have the capacity to frame, revise and pursue their own conception \nof the good? \n  At the very least, I believe that we are on reasonably safe ground to attribute to \nsentient animals the ability to possess and pursue desires.  David DeGrazia puts \nforward the case for this view rather well: \nIf sentience were only the capacity to detect certain stimuli that threatened \nharm\u2026, responses to those stimuli would be automatic and unconscious.  But \nsentient creatures have pleasant and unpleasant feelings, which would have no \nadvantage absent an ability to do something in response to those feelings.  Now \nsurely goal-directed behaviour in response to pleasant and unpleasant feelings \ninvolves desires (say, to escape the source of pain) (DeGrazia, 1996, p. 136).   \n 9 \nHowever, while it seems perfectly reasonable to suppose that sentient animals \npossess and pursue desires, as we have seen, this is not quite the same things as \nautonomy.  For autonomy refers to the capacity to reflect on those desires, and modify \nthem in relation to one\u2019s own conception of the good.  Importantly, such a capacity \nrequires a level of consciousness above mere sentience.  Indeed, one might claim \nthat to be an autonomous agent one needs to possess \u2018higher-order thought \nconsciousness\u2019; that is, to be able to have thoughts about thoughts (Carruthers, \n1992).  Is there any evidence to suggest that the members of any species of animal \naside from Homo sapiens possess such capacities?   \n  For most species of animal, there is no evidence to suggest that they possess such \n\u2018second-order\u2019 or \u2018higher-order\u2019 capacities.  Fish, frogs, rats and cats may all have the \ncapacity for conscious experience and may also possess desires, but there is little in \ntheir physiology or behaviour to suggest that they have the ability to reflect on their \nown thoughts and pursue their own considered goals.  I think then that we are on \nreasonably safe ground when we say that the vast majority of sentient animals are not \nautonomous agents, as I define the term.  However, some philosophers and scientists \nhave maintained that there is evidence to suggest that some types of animal \u2013 in \nparticular, the great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas) and cetaceans \n(whales and dolphins) - do have such capacities.  The reason for attributing such \ncapacities to these animals has usually been based on their apparent ability to master \nsign language or other forms of communication (Singer, 1993, p. 111).  Indeed, there \nis ample evidence of these types of animal learning and using various symbols to \ncommunicate information and their desires.  However, a note of caution is necessary \nat this point.  For although the ability to use signs and symbols to communicate in this \nway is remarkable, it does not necessarily reveal the presence of higher-order thought \nconsciousness.  After all, it seems plausible that an animal might be able to use signs \nto communicate desires or feelings, without necessarily being able to ruminate on \nthose desires and feelings.  Having said that, using such signs to express particular \ntypes of feeling, could well be suggestive of such abilities.  Take the communication of \na feeling of regret, for example.  This seems to convey a reflective capability, involving \ndeliberation over past events and actions, and even critical judgement based on \ncertain values.  Interestingly, some anecdotal evidence is present indicating the \nexpression of regret in gorillas (DeGrazia, 1996, p. 208).  However, such evidence is \nby no means conclusive.  Moreover, some scientists have noted evidence from \nexperiments which suggest that even the great apes lack the ability to inhibit and \nmodify their first-order desires (Hauser, 2001, pp. 309-314).  As it stands then, I \nsimply do not know whether the great apes and cetaceans are autonomous.  More \n 10 \nand better evidence is certainly needed.  Nevertheless, there is certainly a reasonable \npossibility that the great apes and cetaceans are autonomous agents, and possess an \nintrinsic interest in liberty as such.  As I will note later in the paper, this possibility may \nwell give us a good reason to adopt a precautionary principle when outlining our \nobligations to such animals.  That is to say, perhaps we should assume that confining \nand using such animals against their will is necessarily harmful, as it ordinarily is with \nautonomous human beings.  \n  However, the great apes and cetaceans make up only a fraction of the animal \nkingdom, and we are on safe ground in assuming that the vast majority of animals are \nnot autonomous agents in the sense I describe.  Most animals cannot frame, revise \nand pursue their own conceptions of the good.  This is not to say that sentient animals \ndo not have different characters, nor is it to deny that they can make choices.  It is \nsimply to make the point that most animals cannot forge their own life plans and \ngoals.  Given this, restricting the freedom of these animals does not seem to cause \nharm in the same way that it does for humans.  To explain, let us take two examples, \nboth of which involve a straightforward restriction of liberty.  In the first, let us imagine \nbreeding, raising, training, keeping and using an animal for a certain sporting activity.  \nFor example, we do this routinely in the case of horses used in show-jumping.  In the \nsecond, let us imagine breeding, raising, training, keeping and using a human being \nfor a certain sporting activity.  For example, it might be plausible to do this to produce \nexcellent gymnasts.  Now, in the case of the human gymnasts, such actions seem to \nbe obviously harmful.  As autonomous agents, most human beings have a \nfundamental interest in being free to pursue their own life plans, forge their own \nconception of a good life, and not to have a particular way of life forced upon them.  \nHowever, in the case of the horse used in show-jumping, the restriction of freedom \nseems less obviously harmful.  Since they lack autonomy, horses are not able to forge \nand pursue their own conceptions of the good. In which case, it is unclear why \nrestricting the freedom of the horse and imposing a way of life on the animal is \nnecessarily harmful.  This, of course, is not to say that interfering with horses or \npreventing them from having control over their lives never causes harm.  Obviously, if \nwe were to train the horse using violence, if we failed to keep the horse in a suitable \nenvironment, or if we were to make the horse perform dangerous tasks, then harm \nwould be done.  However, the harm in such cases is caused by the suffering to the \nhorse, not the lack of liberty itself.  For this reason, it seems initially plausible to \npropose that for non-autonomous animals, their interest in liberty is only instrumental; \nwhereas for autonomous humans it is intrinsic.       \n 11 \n  This plausibility, however, might be undermined by the work of Tom Regan, who has \nquestioned the presumption that animals are not autonomous agents.  Regan \ndifferentiates between two types of autonomy.  Regan calls the type of autonomy that \nI have been referring to as the \u2018Kantian\u2019 sense of autonomy.  However, Regan claims \nthat this Kantian notion is not the only type of autonomy: \u2018An alternative view is that \nindividuals are autonomous if they have preferences and have the ability to initiate \naction with a view to satisfying them (Regan, 2004, p. 80).\u2019ii  Regan labels this type of \nautonomy \u2018preference autonomy\u2019, and claims that while it is highly unlikely that any \nanimal possesses Kantian autonomy, many animals can be viewed as possessing \npreference autonomy.  Here, I think, Regan is quite right: for as was discussed above, \nit is perfectly reasonable to recognise that sentient animals have desires, but also to \nacknowledge that the majority of them lack the capacity for higher-order thought \nconsciousness.  However, if we accept that sentient animals are autonomous in this \npreference-based sense, does that ground an intrinsic interest in liberty? \n  A positive answer to this question might be fleshed out in the following way.  While \nanimals do not have the capacity to reflect on and pursue their own life goals, they do \nhave desires and are able to pursue their desires with a view to satisfying them.  In \nlight of this, it might be claimed that just as being free to exercise their autonomous \ncapacities is good for humans, so too is it good for animals.  Thus, being able to \npursue their desires with a view to satisfying them, so the argument might go, is \nnecessarily good for animals.  In this way, it might be argued that animals possess an \nintrinsic interest in liberty.iii \n  Unfortunately, this reworked autonomy argument does not justify an intrinsic animal \ninterest in liberty.  First of all, we might question whether pursuing their desires is \nnecessarily good for animals.  For example, many of us are familiar with dogs who \ndesire to eat as much as possible; a desire that when satisfied can lead to obesity and \nsevere health problems.  However, the more important point is that even if pursuing \ntheir desires with a view to satisfying them is necessarily good for animals, it is \npossible for them to exercise such capacities even when they lack freedom.  Thus, the \ncase of animals is quite different to that of humans, who cannot exercise their \nautonomous capacities when they lack freedom.  Consider for example two \nindividuals: a pet dog who is treated well by his loving owner, and a human slave who \nis treated well by a kindly master.  In both cases, the individuals lack freedom: they \nare interfered with (actually or potentially) and are not in control of their own lives.  \nNow, in the former case, the dog is able to pursue his desires for food, comfort, \nshelter, companionship, exercise and so on with a view to satisfying them.  \nStraightforwardly then, the pet dog is quite capable of exercising his autonomous \n 12 \ncapacities.  In the case of the slave, however, the situation is very different.  The slave \nsimply cannot frame, revise and pursue her own conception of the good.  Quite clearly \nshe is prevented from choosing and leading her own life.  In other words then, the \ncapacity for autonomy has an intrinsic link to liberty in the case of humans; but \nbecause it is reconceived in terms of preferences, has no such link in the case of \nanimals. \n  If animals are to be shown to possess an intrinsic interest in liberty we need a \nstronger argument than that pertaining to preference autonomy.  It needs to be shown \nthat being free from interference and being in control of their lives are in themselves \ngood for animals.  The fact that animals are \u2018preference autonomous\u2019 is insufficient to \nprove the case; it is possible for animals to pursue their desires even when they lack \nliberty.  Perhaps then, animals possess an intrinsic interest in liberty in order that they \nmight properly exercise their natural functionings.  This is the argument I examine in \nthe next section. \n \nThe Natural Functionings Argument \nSeveral philosophers have claimed that the animal interest in freedom is not founded \non their capacities for autonomous agency, but on the fact that it is good for animals \nto be able to exercise their \u2018natural functionings\u2019.  Natural functionings refer to the \nnormal \u2018beings\u2019 and \u2018doings\u2019 of a species of animal in the wild.  So, for example, acting \nas kangaroos have naturally evolved to act \u2013 say by residing, roaming, eating, mating \nand rearing young within the Australian bush - is argued to be good for kangaroos.  \nMartha C. Nussbaum\u2019s recent application of her capabilities approach to animals is \ncertainly in this spirit. She writes, \u2018\u2026if we feel wonder looking at a complex organism, \nthat wonder at least suggests the idea that it is good for that being to flourish as the \nkind of thing it is (Nussbaum, 2004, p. 306)\u2019. \n  However, it is Paul W. Taylor who has most explicitly linked this idea of natural \nfunctionings with a conception of freedom.  Taylor outlines four different types of \nfreedom and argues that three of them - free will, autonomy and social freedom - \nrelate only to human beings (Taylor, 1986, pp. 105-106).  However, there is, he \nclaims, a fourth sense of freedom, and this fourth sense applies to both human and \nnonhuman entities: \nTo be free in this sense is to be able to pursue one\u2019s ends because no \nrestrictions, obstacles or forces frustrate one\u2019s attempt (absence of positive \nconstraints) and because one has the necessary abilities, opportunities, and \nmeans to gain one\u2019s ends (absence of negative constraints). Now it is this \n 13 \ngeneral idea of freedom that applies to nonhuman living things as well as to \npersons (Taylor, 1986, p. 108). \nSo, Taylor construes this type of freedom both negatively and positively.  However, to \nbe free in this sense is not just to be free from interference in general, nor is it \nfreedom to control one\u2019s life in general; instead, it is to lack interference and to \npossess control in order to pursue one\u2019s ends.  But it is important to realise that here \none\u2019s ends are not simply one\u2019s desires, nor are they one\u2019s own chosen conception of \nthe good.  Rather, Taylor conceptualises freedom as the ability to pursue one\u2019s \nnatural functionings or biological ends (Taylor, 1986, p. 109).  Not only does this \nconception of freedom apply to animals, however, but it is also, according to Taylor, \nvaluable for them (Taylor, 1986, p. 106).  So, in short, the claim is that it is good for \nanimals to be free, where freedom is construed as the ability to exercise one\u2019s natural \nfunctionings.  \n  Of course, the conception of freedom that Taylor presents here relates to many other \ncreatures than just animals.  In fact, since all living things possess biological ends or \nfunctionings, it relates to every single living organism.  Taylor is well aware of this, and \nargues unequivocally that all living things have an interest in this type of freedom.  \nOther philosophers such as Nussbaum disagree and confine their claims as being \nrelevant only to sentient animals (Nussbaum, 2006, pp. 361-362).  However, the \nrelative merits of either side of this debate are not my concern.  For I want to claim \nthat all of these functioning arguments have a fundamental flaw.   \n  One objection to the functioning argument that we need to consider is similar to that \nwhich defeated the preference autonomy argument.  Just as animals can adequately \npursue their desires when denied freedom, perhaps they are also able to pursue their \nbiological ends when they are constrained or lack control of their lives.  After all, isn\u2019t it \npossible for a dog to act like a dog even when a pet, or for a horse to act like a horse \neven when trained to show-jump, or even a penguin to act like a penguin when kept in \na zoo?  Well, perhaps not.  For if one construes \u2018biological ends\u2019 or \u2018natural \nfunctionings\u2019 to mean existing naturally in the wild, then it would seem that these uses \nand constraints are necessarily restrictive.  If this is correct, animals cannot pursue \ntheir true biological ends when they lack freedom. \n  Let us concede then, that denying animals their freedom prevents them from \npursuing their biological ends and natural functionings.  Does such prevention \nnecessarily make their lives worse?  I wish to claim that it does not.  For while the \nability to exercise natural capacities and pursue what is natural is of course often a \nbenefit, by facilitating other goods such as pleasure and the absence of frustration, \nsuch an ability is not in itself good for animals.  To explain this position, I should \n 14 \nremind you of two claims that I made in the earlier discussion of what it means to have \nan interest: first, interests are components of well-being; and second, well-being is a \nprudential value.  As a reminder then, interests concern those things that make life go \nwell for the individual whose life it is.  However, to say that the life of an animal (or \nother organism) is better when it acts in accordance with its natural functionings is to \nimpose a perfectionist value on that individual.iv  To make perfectionist valuations is to \ntalk about what makes an individual a better or worse example of its kind.  But while \nanimals (and other organisms) might be better examples of their species when they \nexercise their natural functionings, this does not in itself tell us whether their lives are \nbetter for them.  Thus the fundamental mistake that proponents of these functioning \narguments make is to conflate an entity\u2019s biological functionings with an entity\u2019s own \ngood. \n  Of course, at this point, we need to consider whether this conflation is justified; \nperhaps it does always make life better for an individual to be a more perfect example \nof its kind.  However, such a claim is rather odd, and can quickly be dismissed with \nsome examples.  I may be a purer example of the human species if I were to hunt \nanimals, kill them, cook them and eat their flesh.  These, after all, are \u2018natural \nfunctionings\u2019 of human beings.  However, I have no desire to do these things, and \nwould rather not eat animals, let alone go out and kill them.  Moreover, I can lead a \nperfectly healthy life without hunting and without eating meat.  What makes me a \nmore perfect example of my kind is a separate question from what makes my life go \nwell.  And this is true for all sentient animals.  A stag may be a better example of a \nstag if he engages in fights over territory and mates.  But exercising such capacities \ndoes not always benefit stags.  It seems nonsensical to suppose that the losers of \nsuch fights who often suffer painful and life-threatening injuries have lives that go well \nfor themselves.  So while it is true that animals will often get great satisfaction from \nbeing good examples of their kind and being able to exercise their natural \nfunctionings, such freedom does not in itself make their lives better for them. \n  In sum then, we must be wary of slipping into perfectionist valuations when making \njudgements about the interests of individuals.  Animals might be better examples of \ntheir kind when they exercise their natural functionings.  However, this does not tell us \nwhether life always goes better for them when they exercise such functionings.  In \nfact, upon reflection we can see that life does not necessarily go better for individuals \nwhen they exercise their natural functionings.  So even when freedom is \nconceptualised as the ability to pursue one\u2019s natural biological ends, animals still \npossess no intrinsic interest in freedom. \n \n 15 \nImplications for our Obligations to Animals \nI have argued that the two arguments in support of an intrinsic animal interest in \nliberty \u2013 that from preference autonomy, and that from natural functionings - both fail.  \nThis, I believe, comes down to the fact that most animals are not autonomous in the \nKantian sense.  Only autonomous beings have an interest in governing their own lives \nwithout interference from others.  This is because only autonomous creatures can \nchoose, reflect on and pursue their own ends.  So while animals can desire things, \ncan act intentionally towards satisfying their desires and can pursue their biological \nends, they cannot reflect upon and choose their own life goals.  Without such \ncapacities for reflection, animals are \u2018locked into\u2019 their ends and desires in a way that \nmost adult humans are not.  Interfering with an animal or preventing her from \ncontrolling her own life does not necessarily harm that animal, quite simply because \nanimals are not autonomous in the relevant sense.  To deny an animal freedom does \nnot in itself setback that animal\u2019s interests. \n  So what does all this mean for how we should treat animals?  First of all, I should \nnote that a substantive account of our obligations to animals does not make itself \nreadily available from the sole claim that animals have no intrinsic interest in liberty.  \nFor one thing, the production of such an account requires much more work than there \nis room for in this paper.  Furthermore, the content of such an account will also \ndepend on the particular normative framework that one uses.  Thus, the following \ndiscussion of the implications of the claim that animals have no intrinsic interest in \nliberty can only be a preliminary one \u2013 much more work needs to be done.  Having \nsaid all of this, many normative theories, including those concerning animals, place \ngreat importance on the interests of individuals.  For example, utilitarians often talk \nabout maximising interest-satisfaction, while deontologists often want to protect \ninterests through assigning rights.  Thus, the contention that most animals have no \nintrinsic interest in liberty has concrete implications from the standpoints of quite \ndifferent theories.  In this section then, I tentatively attempt to consider some of these \nimplications.   \n  Firstly, it is important to point out what does not necessarily follow from the fact that \nmost animals lack an intrinsic interest in liberty.  Some philosophers have argued that \nbecause animals are not autonomous agents, we have no direct obligations to them \nwhatsoever (Cohen, 1986; Fox, 1978).  I have not argued this.  In fact, the paper \nassumes, in keeping with the Animal Welfare Act, that we do have direct obligations to \nthem, and thus that we must take great care in determining what the interests of \nanimals are.  Others have argued that because animals are not autonomous agents \nawarding full rights to them makes no sense (Leahy, 1991, pp. 187-188).  But I have \n 16 \nnot argued this.  Indeed, if one regards the essential feature of rights to be the \nprotection of interests, it seems reasonable to recognise that animals can and do \npossess certain rights (Feinberg, 1974).  Still others have claimed that because \nanimals lack autonomy their lives are less valuable than those of human beings (Frey, \n1987; Steinbock, 1978).  Once again, I have not argued this.  For it is at least \nplausible to endorse equality between humans and sentient animals while also \nacknowledging that the two possess different interests (Singer, 1990).  In sum then, \nthe claim that many animals possess no intrinsic interest in liberty does not undermine \nthe pursuit of justice for animals.  It is perfectly possible to acknowledge that most \nanimals have no intrinsic interest in liberty, while recognising that our obligations to \nthem are various and pressing.   \n  The second thing to note is that I have not argued that animals have no interest in \nliberty whatsoever.  As I pointed out above, it may well be the case that some types of \nanimal - such as the great apes and cetaceans - are autonomous agents and so do \npossess an intrinsic interest in liberty.  Given this possibility, I believe that it would be \nwise for states to adopt a precautionary principle when legislating in respect of these \nanimals.  That is to say, because keeping and using animals such as chimpanzees \nand dolphins may well be harmful in and of themselves, states should legislate so as \nto outlaw such practices involving these animals.  This, of course, would have \nimportant and significant implications with regards to using and keeping such animals \nin zoos, sea-life parks, circuses, research laboratories and so on. \n  Moreover, even those animals that are clearly non-autonomous, and thus possess \nno intrinsic interest in liberty, will often have an instrumental interest in liberty.  And \njust because this interest is instrumental rather than intrinsic does not mean that it is \nof any less importance.  Consider, for example, farm animals crowded into cramped \ncages, zoo animals held in bland environments lacking stimulation, and laboratory \nanimals forcibly injected with toxins.  All of these animals have a strong interest in \nbeing free; and one whose strength is not weakened by the fact that it is founded on \nan intrinsic interest in not suffering.  Furthermore, many species of animal will \nnecessarily be harmed by certain types of restriction on their liberty. For instance, \nanimals such as horses, cats, dogs and so on require social interaction to avoid \nboredom and depression, and will necessarily suffer from being held in isolation.  \nSimilarly, some species such as polar bears and elephants require large habitats to \navoid frustration, and keeping them in very confined enclosures will necessarily cause \nharm.  Once again, these animals\u2019 interest in liberty is instrumental, but it is real, \npressing, and should be recognised in our moral and political obligations.  As such, \nthe argument of this paper does not provide justification for the suffering inflicted on \n 17 \nanimals in intensive farming, experimentation, zoos, circuses and so on.  To this \nextent then, the implications of this argument do not contradict the goals of those \ncampaigners for animals whose primary aim is to put an end to the suffering that \nanimals endure at the hands of human beings. \n  Nevertheless, the claim that most animals have no intrinsic interest in liberty does \nmake some infringements upon the liberty of animals harmless, implying that such \ninfringements are permissible.  This leads us to the third implication of the conclusion \nof this paper: that it is sometimes permissible to use and keep animals for certain \npurposes.  To put it plainly, keeping and using most animals in zoos, circuses, \nresearch laboratories, as pets and so on are not harmful in and of themselves.  Of \ncourse, and as I have pointed out above, it is clear that a good many of such uses are \nharmful because they cause suffering.  However, the conclusion of this paper is that \nwe can end the harm of such practices through regulation and reform to end the \nsuffering; we do not need to abolish each and every incident of animal use.  In this \nsense then, the Animal Welfare Act is in the right spirit: regulation of animal use is the \nway forward, rather than abolition and liberation.  Of course, given the animal \nsuffering that the Act does not address, it is reasonable to claim that its regulation \ngoes nowhere near far enough. \n  Importantly, the argument for regulation rather than abolition stands in opposition to \nthe views of other proponents of and campaigners for justice for animals.  These \nindividuals argue that using animals for certain purposes, even when such use is \npainless and non-lethal, is necessarily harmful.  According to them, using animals in \nfarming, entertainment, sport, laboratories, and so on, necessarily treats those \nanimals as the equivalent of slaves; they are simply resources to be exploited \n(Francione, 1996, p. 2).  I hope to have shown in the paper that the use of some \nanimals for certain purposes is not analogous to the institution of human slavery.  For \nwhile human slavery and human well-being are mutually exclusive, the same is not \ntrue of animal use and animal well-being.  This difference is based on the way we as \nhumans differ as a species: humans have an intrinsic interest in being free based on \ntheir capacity to frame, revise and pursue their own conceptions of the good.  Most \nother species of animal lack this capacity and thus lack the corresponding interest.  \nNone of this implies that we as humans are innately superior to other animals, or even \nthat our interests must always take priority over those of other species.  It is simply to \nrecognise that different species have different capacities, and thus do not share \nidentical sets of interests.  \n  Of course, the conclusion that it is not necessarily harmful to infringe on the liberty of \nanimals does not only make it sometimes permissible to keep and use them, it also \n 18 \nmakes it sometimes permissible to interfere with them; and this is the final implication \nof the conclusion of this paper.  This implication has particular significance for how we \ntreat animals in the wild.  For instance, it is thought by some proponents of animal \nrights, as well as environmentalists, that we should adopt a policy of \u2018benign neglect\u2019 \ntowards animals in the wild (Pluhar, 1995, p. 276; Regan, 2004, p. 357).  That is to \nsay, non-interference is argued to be the best thing we can do for such animals.  \nHowever, if interference is not in itself harmful to animals, then perhaps it is legitimate \nfor us to interfere with them when we have good reason.  In fact, if we are concerned \nabout the real harms that befall animals, such as suffering, then perhaps we have an \nobligation to interfere when we can reasonably alleviate such harm.  So perhaps \npolicies of \u2018benign neglect\u2019 towards wild animals should be overturned in favour of \npolicies of \u2018benign interference\u2019! \n  However, we must be extremely cautious here.  If interference in the lives of wild \nanimals is to be recommended in order to alleviate harm, we must be absolutely \ncertain that our interferences will have this intended effect.  For example, a predator \nundoubtedly causes harm to its prey, simply by chasing, catching and killing it.  \nNevertheless, it is unclear how it would be possible to interfere with this process in \norder to alleviate overall harm.  For if we were somehow able to remove the prey from \nthat environment, wouldn\u2019t the predators who feed on it suffer?  And if we were able to \nremove the predators, wouldn\u2019t the prey species become abundant and out compete \nmembers of other species, who themselves would then suffer?  It is certainly clear to \nsee from this example how interfering with wild animals to prevent harm might, as a \nmatter of fact, cause more overall harm in the long run.  However, none of this rules \nout the very idea of benign interference.  Indeed, given the conclusion of this paper, \nwhen there is compelling evidence that harm will in fact be alleviated, benign \ninterference might well be permissible. \n  Before summing up, it is necessary to examine a possible problem with the line of \nargument that I have taken in the paper.  If animals do not possess an intrinsic \ninterest in liberty because they are not autonomous in the relevant sense, then human \nbeings who are not autonomous in the relevant sense must also lack such an interest.  \nFurthermore, if it is sometimes permissible to keep, use and interfere with animals \nbecause they do not have this interest, then surely the same must be true for these \nnon-autonomous human beings.  Put simply, the logic of my argument seems to imply \nthat it is permissible to interfere with, keep and use non-autonomous humans such as \ninfants and the severely mentally disabled.  For some, this might be too \ncounterintuitive to be plausible, and render the whole argument ineffective. \n 19 \n  However, to challenge this type of intuition I wish to make three points.  First of all, \nand as was the case with non-human animals, while I do deny that non-autonomous \nhumans possess an intrinsic interest in liberty, I do not deny their other interests.  \nHuman infants and the severely mentally disabled without doubt have important \ninterests in such things as avoiding suffering and continued life, and my argument \nprovides no justification whatsoever for violating these.  Secondly, interfering in the \nlives of non-autonomous humans is not only currently routine and uncontroversial, but \nis also often a moral obligation on our part.  For example, paternalistic practices such \nas imposing education and the appropriate nutrition on human infants and the \nmentally disabled, are surely praiseworthy rather than harmful.  Indeed, it would be \nabsurd to claim that we violate the intrinsic interests of a baby by putting her in a \nnappy!  Finally, while the idea of keeping and using non-autonomous humans for \ncertain purposes might at first make us feel uneasy, we should be extremely clear \nabout what kinds of practices would be permissible.  For clearly, keeping and using \nsuch humans in ways that causes harm immediately or in the future, such as using \nnon-autonomous humans in painful experiments or using them as slaves, can \ncategorically be ruled out.  And quite obviously, ordinarily no use of a non-\nautonomous human would be permissible if against the wishes and interests of the \nparticular individual\u2019s parents or guardians.  So simply because it is sometimes \npermissible to use infants for certain purposes - say in scientific studies, or to act in \nplays \u2013 does not open the door for child-slavery, or anything like it.  In light of all this, \nwe can see that the conclusions of this paper do not lead to grossly counterintuitive \nimplications for our relations with non-autonomous humans.   \n \nConclusion \nI have argued that most animals have no intrinsic interest in liberty.  This is based on \nthe claim that these animals, unlike humans, lack the capacity to frame, revise and \npursue their own conception of the good.  The two prominent arguments in favour of \nanimals having an intrinsic interest in liberty both fail.  Neither the argument from \npreference autonomy, nor the argument from natural functionings does the work that \ntheir advocates propose.  This conclusion directly impacts on our moral and political \nobligations to animals.  Importantly, for most animals our obligations do not consist of \nliberating them, and we can use and interfere with non-human animals more often \nthan some proponents of justice for animals have claimed.  Furthermore, using non-\nautonomous animals for certain purposes is not analogous to human slavery.  We do \nnot need to abolish all of the ways in which we keep and use animals; reforming those \npractices so that they guarantee animal welfare is sufficient.  Clearly, of course, more \n 20 \nwork needs to be done in terms of fleshing out our precise obligations to animals than \nthere has been room for here.  However, such work must be informed by a precise \nunderstanding of just what is, and what is not, in the interests of animals.  It is all too \neasy to accord animals the same interests as those that are accorded to human \nbeings.  While human and non-human animals are similar in many important respects, \nthe autonomous capacities of each are clearly different.  Because of this important \ndifference, we can conclude that most non-human animals have no intrinsic interest in \nliberty. \n \n \n \nBibliography \n \nAnderson, E.
