Introduction\nThe Gwna Group is a spectacular, regional scale\nm\u00e9lange, estimated to be up to 3000 m thick (Gibbons\n& McCarroll, 1993), which crops out over an area of\nat least 200 km2 in northwest Wales. This unit was the\nfirst such chaotic deposit ever to be described in the\nliterature and to which the term \u2018m\u00e9lange\u2019 was first\napplied (Greenly, 1919), thus it may be considered the\ninformal \u2018type-locality\u2019 for m\u00e9lange. Although mapped\nby Greenly (1919) and Matley (1928), and in parts of\nLly\u02c6n more recently by Gibbons & McCarroll (1993),\nthe age of m\u00e9lange deposition remains contentious.\nPalaeozoic microfossil evidence for its age (e.g. Muir\net al. 1979) has been contested (Peat, 1984) and appears\nto contradict metamorphic data (e.g. Kawai et al. 2006).\nQuoted ages range from Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran)\n(Gibbons & Hor\u00e1k, 1996; Kawai et al. 2006) to early\nOrdovician (Barber & Max, 1979; Collins & Buchan,\n2004). This paper forms part of a broader study of\nthe provenance and age of clasts within the m\u00e9lange,\nand presents radiogenic and stable isotope evidence\nto establish the age of limestone megaclasts, thereby\nproviding a constraint on the depositional age of the\nm\u00e9lange.\n2. Gwna Group m\u00e9lange\nThe Gwna Group m\u00e9lange has traditionally been placed\nat the top of the Monian Supergroup succession,\na thick (up to 7500 m), low-grade, polydeformed,\nmetasedimentary sequence exposed across North\nWales on Anglesey and on northwest Lly\u02c6n (Shackleton,\n1954, 1969; Gibbons et al. 1994) (Fig. 1). This\nsuccession has an unproven original relationship with\nthe adjacent crystalline Neoproterozoic rocks (the\n\u2217Author for correspondence: Jana.horak@museumwales.ac.uk\nCoedana and Sarn complexes on Anglesey and Lly\u02c6n,\nrespectively) and its age of deposition and tectono-\nsedimentary setting have invoked much debate. The\nMonian Supergroup has been interpreted as part of a\nNeoproterozoic, peri-Gondwanan, forearc accretionary\ncomplex (Gibbons & Hor\u00e1k, 1996). However, the age\nof the m\u00e9lange formation must now be reviewed in light\nof recent detrital zircon U\u2013Pb SIMS data for the South\nStack Group, the basal unit of the Monian Supergroup.\nThese data indicate a maximum depositional age for\nthe South Stack Group of late Early Cambrian to early\nMiddle Cambrian (Collins & Buchan, 2004) and imply\nthat the New Harbour and Gwna groups (Fig. 1) were\ndeposited after this, but prior to the deposition of the\noverlying Arenig sediments. However, these data are\ninconsistent with the Gwna Group being formed during\nNeoproterozoic subduction. This has led to a wider\nre-evaluation of Monian Supergroup stratigraphy, of\nwhich this study forms a part, and provokes the\nsuggestion that it may not be one contiguous succession\nas originally defined by Greenly (1919) and modified\nby Shackleton (1954, 1969).\nThe m\u00e9lange typically forms spectacular coastal\noutcrops on Anglesey and Lly\u02c6n (Fig. 2) but is poorly\nexposed inland. Clasts range in scale from boulders\nthrough to megaclasts hundreds of metres across and\ncan be divided into at least two suites: (1) basaltic\npillow lavas with a MORB chemistry (Thorpe et al.\n1984), hyaloclastites, limestone breccias, red cherty\nmudstones, and minor jasper, all suggestive of an\noceanic affinity; (2) clasts comprising sandstones, ran-\nging from orthoquartzite to litharenites, mudstones and\nshallow-water limestones. Schuster (1979) also defined\nan additional pebbly mudstone facies. The matrix\nis variable in composition and although dominantly\nargillaceous, it may also be coarser grained and rich\nin fragments of disaggregated clasts. The degree of\nmetamorphism and deformation varies between the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\nEarly Neoproterozoic limestones from Anglesey 79\nFigure 1.

Large ornamented clasts within the Gwna Group are a\nschematic representation of megaclasts of limestone, quartzite,\nvolcaniclastic sandstone and pillow lava. No stratigraphic\nrelationship is implied by the relative position of the clasts.\nmajor outcrops of the m\u00e9lange. To the southwest, on\nLly\u02c6n, illite crystallinity data reflect epizone conditions\n(Kubler Index (KI) values in the range \u0002\u25e62\u03b8 0.20\u2013\n0.26) (Merriman & Roberts, 1985). The m\u00e9lange\nhere shows a D1 slaty cleavage, a main D2 folding,\nand minor localized D3\u2013D5 deformation events (F. A.\nGibbons, unpub. Ph.D. thesis, CNNA, 1980; Gibbons\n& McCarroll, 1993). This contrasts with northern\nAnglesey, where illite crystallinity values show only\ndiagenetic to lower anchizone grade (K.I. values in the\nrange \u0002\u25e62\u03b8 0.39\u20130.42) (R. J. Merriman, pers. comm.\n2003) and the degree of deformation appears lower.\nFigure 2. Simplified geological map of north Wales showing the\ndistribution of Gwna Group and the other two components of the\nMonian Supergroup (South Stack and New Harbour groups).\nAge constraints on the depositional age of the\nm\u00e9lange are limited. In northern Anglesey, Arenig\nsediments rest unconconformably on the m\u00e9lange,\nthereby providing a minimum age limit of around\n478 Ma. On the basis of poorly preserved arcritarch\nassemblages extracted from cherts within the basaltic\nsuite in the m\u00e9lange at Llandwyn Island (Fig. 2),\nSW Anglesey, Muir et al. (1979) suggested that the\nm\u00e9lange could be no older than Early Cambrian.\nHowever, Peat (1984) questioned these interpretations,\nand refuted them on the basis of the poor state of\npreservation of the microfossils. Stromatolites have\nalso been described, but not figured, from a limestone\nmegaclast in the m\u00e9lange near Llanbadrig (Fig. 3) on\nnorthern Anglesey by Wood & Nicholls (1973), who\nattributed unbranching stromatolites to Conophyton.\nMuir et al. (1979) made brief reference to more\ncomplex, branching forms that they placed in the\ngenus Georginia. Although these authors attributed a\nlatest Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian age to these\nstromatolites, this age range is not closely constrained\nby the identifications given. Conophyton is a long-\nranging genus with examples known from the early\nProterozoic (2.1 Ga) to Cambrian (c. 515 Ma) (Grey,\n1995; Walter, 1972). Further work by the authors and\nco-workers is therefore ongoing to establish if the\ntaxonomy of the stromatolites can be refined.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\n80 J.

(2006) described a\nprograde metamorphic sequence in SE Anglesey\nfrom metabasites of sub-greenschist facies through\ngreenshist facies into the blueschist belt. Dallmeyer\n& Gibbons (1987) dated amphibole and phengite\nfrom these blueschists as recording metamorphism at\nc. 550\u2013560 Ma. This would appear to constrain the\nage of m\u00e9lange formation to pre-550 Ma. However,\nM. Gyopari (unpub. M.Phil. thesis, Univ. Wales,\nCardiff, 1984) also examined the greenschist-facies\nm\u00e9lange to blueschist transition and his findings\ncontradict those of Kawai et al. (2006), as he concluded\nthat the boundary between the m\u00e9lange and the\nblueschist-facies rocks was a shear zone and the two\nunits did not form a contiguous metamorphic sequence.\nClearly, characterizing the nature of the clasts and\nconstraining the depositional age of the m\u00e9lange are es-\nsential to establishing the broader tectono-sedimentary\nand tectono-metamorphic context in which it was\nformed. This paper uses a chemostratigraphic approach\nto re-examine the limestone megaclasts in northern\nAnglesey to provide additional age constraint data on\nthe m\u00e9lange.\n2.a. Limestone megaclasts\nA range of carbonate clasts is present within the\nGwna Group m\u00e9lange of Anglesey and Lly\u02c6n, showing\nvariation in texture, composition, size and clast density.\nIn both Lly\u02c6n and SW Anglesey, pink Mn-rich carbonate\noccurs interstitial to basaltic pillow lavas and as the\nmatrix to limestone lava breccias (F. A. Gibbons, unpub.\nPh.D. thesis, CNNA, 1980). Lenses of white, grey or\nbuff limestone are dispersed throughout the m\u00e9lange,\nand Gibbons described large, dolomitic limestone\nblocks from Lly\u02c6n.\nThe largest limestone blocks occur in northern\nAnglesey, where clasts from tens to hundreds of metres\nacross have been mapped from the west side of Cemaes\nBay to the west coast of Bull Bay (see Fig. 2) (Greenly,\n1920). However, it is in the region immediately adjacent\nto Cemaes Bay that the largest limestone blocks occur\nwhere, associated typically with quartzite or grey-green\nsandstones, they dominate the m\u00e9lange. The degree of\ndolomitization within the limestone varies, but appears\nto be lowest in the larger blocks such as that at Trywn\ny Parc (Fig. 3).\n2.b. Trwyn y Parc megaclast\nThe Trwyn y Parc megaclast (Fig. 3) has a stratigraphic\nthickness of around 250 m. The exposure is almost\ncontinuous along the low cliffs, and towards the middle\nof the section the sequence has been exposed by an\nagricultural lime quarry. A steep fault runs along the\nsouthern edge of the quarry; to the north of this the\nbedding within the carbonate dips steeply (typically\n80\u25e6) to the NNE or is sub-vertical. Stromatolitic\nhorizons indicate that the sequence youngs towards\nthe north. South of the fault the carbonate dips more\nmoderately at 45\u25e6 to the NE. The southern margin of\nthe megaclast is brecciated and dolomitized, and shows\nan undulating contact with the underlying semi-pelitic\nm\u00e9lange matrix, with tongues of matrix projecting\ninto the limestone. The carbonate sequence can be\nsubdivided into eight units, which reflect a progressive\ndeepening from a sub- to peri-tidal environment.\nThe sequence comprises interbedded units of lam-\ninated, neomorphed micrite, microbially laminated\ncarbonate, which may be variably dolomitized, more\nmassive calcilutite, locally veined by calcite, and\ncoarser calcirudite layers. The latter contains allochems\nthat are dominated by peloidal cigar-shaped structures,\nup to 2 mm long and 0.5 mm wide, which are\ninterpreted as intraclasts from reworked fragments\nof microbial laminated carbonate. Ooids are also\npresent within this part of the sequence and are\nparticularly apparent towards the northern margin of\nthe megaclast. The entire sequence shows a variable\ndegree of dolomitization, with the marginal units being\nmost affected and the central portion least affected. A\nhorizon of dolomitized pods (each up to 0.7 m high\nand 1 m long) is present towards the centre of the\nsequence and is well exposed on the north side of the\nquarry where it intersects the cliffs. A more detailed\ndescription and interpretation of the petrology will be\npresented elsewhere.\n3. Analytical techniques\nRepresentative samples from the lithological units\ndescribed were selected for whole-rock geochemical\nanalysis. The location of these is indicated in Figure 3.\nThe same powders were used for whole-rock, XRD\nand isotopic analysis. These were first prepared by\nremoval of all weathered surfaces; they were then\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\nEarly Neoproterozoic limestones from Anglesey 81\nTable 1.

Whole-rock analysis was undertaken using a\nThermoElemental ICP-MS system at Cardiff Univer-\nsity.

All isotopic\nwork was completed at the NERC Isotope Geoscience\nLaboratories, Keyworth.\n3.a. 87Sr\/86Sr analysis\nApproximately 100 milligrams of powder were leached\nin a Teflon R\u00a9 beaker with dilute acetic acid in a HEPA-\nfiltered clean air hood. The leachate was converted\nto chloride form and the strontium was separated\nusing standard chromatographic exchange techniques\non Dowex resin (Dickin, 1995). The samples were\nloaded onto single rhenium filaments using a TaF\nemission enhancer (Birck, 1986). The 87Sr\/86Sr isotope\ncomposition of the strontium was determined using\na Thermo Triton multi-collector mass spectrometer,\nwhich gave a reproducibility of 0.701222 \u00b1 0.000016\n(2\u03c3, n = 35) during the analysis of these samples. All\ndata are normalized to a value of 0.710250 for NBS 987.\n3.b. \u03b413C and \u03b418O analysis\nThe equivalent of 10 mg of carbonate was reacted with\nanhydrous phosphoric acid in vacuo overnight at a\nconstant 25 \u25e6C. The CO2 liberated was separated from\nwater vapour under vacuum and collected for analysis.\nMeasurements were made on a VG Optima mass spec-\ntrometer. Overall analytical reproducibility for these\nsamples is normally better than 0.1 \u2030 for \u03b413C and \u03b418O\n(2\u03c3). Isotope values (\u03b413C, \u03b418O) are reported as per mil\n(\u2030) deviations of the isotopic ratios (13C\/12C, 18O\/16O)\ncalculated to the VPDB scale using a within-run\nlaboratory standard calibrated against NBS standards.\n4. Whole-rock geochemistry\nWhole-rock geochemical data for the samples were\ndetermined to reveal extent of dolomitization and\nprovide geochemical indicators that might reflect post-\ndepositional modification of the primary carbonate\nFigure 4.

Data are presented in Table 1 and\nplotted in Figures 4 and 5.\nAll samples show high carbonate content, with a\nmaximum SiO2 content of 3.30 wt % and a maximum\nquartz content of 3 % volume determined by XRD. A\ncorrelation between K2O and Al2O3 suggests that a few\nsamples have a minor clay mineral content (NMW 513,\n518, 545). A correlation between dolomite content and\nwhole-rock MgO abundance (R2 = 0.9753) indicates\nthat all magnesium is contained within dolomite. This\npermits classification of the carbonates on the relative\nabundance of calcite and dolomite (Fig. 4).\nTwo samples from the top and base of the sequence\n(NMW 538, NMW 547), plus one from dolomite\npods within the sequence (NMW 543), fall within the\ndolostone field containing more than 90 % dolomite,\none plots as a calcitic dolomite (60\u201390 % dolomite)\n(NMW 546), and two plot as dolomitic limestones\n(10\u201359 % dolomite) (NMW 539, NMW 542) (Fig. 4).\nAll other samples are classified as limestone as they\ncontain less than 10 % dolomite. The block therefore\nshows clear zones of dolomitization on its margins, as\nindicated by the high MgO content.\nThese zones of dolomitization also show an elevated\nMn content and higher Mn\/Sr ratios than the non-\ndolomitized samples from the centre of the megaclast\n(Table 1, Fig. 5). This is a product of both an increased\ncontent of Mn and a reduction of Sr in these dolomitized\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\n82 J. M .

Several workers have suggested that Mn\/Sr is\na valuable indicator of post-depositional modification\nof isotopic signatures, most notably 87Sr\/86Sr, and to\na lesser extent \u03b413C, although the specific value used\nto filter modified from non-modified samples varies\nbetween studies, with little consensus (e.g. Derry et al.\n1989; Asmerom et al. 1991; Kaufman, Jacobsen &\nKnoll, 1993; Denison et al. 1994; McArthur, 1994;\nJacobsen & Kaufman, 1999; Fairchild et al. 2000).\nHowever, the high Mn\/Sr and low Sr values observed\nat the margins of the carbonate megaclast suggest that\nthese dolomitized samples might well not have retained\ntheir primary 87Sr\/86Sr isotopic signature.\n5. Isotopic data\nStrontium isotope data are presented in Table 2 and\ndisplayed in Figure 6, and show a systematic variation\nacross the carbonate block. The most radiogenic\n87Sr\/86Sr values are found on the southern and northern\nmargins of the clast (0.710484\u20130.708824, samples\nNMW 547, NMW 546; 0.707146\u20130.708192, NMW\n539, NMW 538, respectively), whereas the limestone\nin the central part of block (NMW 541\u2013NMW 545;\nFig. 3) is typically less radiogenic 87Sr\/86Sr (0.706902\u2013\n0.706198).\n\u03b418O and \u03b413C analyses were also undertaken on all\nsamples. The limestone samples show strongly negative\n\u03b418O values, ranging from \u221215.7 to \u221218.89 \u03b418O\n(VPDB), whereas the dolostones, and calcitic dolomite\ncontaining 86\u2013100 % dolomite, are significantly less\ndepleted.

Identifying primary isotopic signatures\nAlthough it is suggested by some researchers that the\ncomposition of seawater may have varied though time\n(e.g. Wadleigh & Veizer, 1992; Veizer et al. 1999;\nL\u00e9cuyer & Allemend, 1999), Jacobsen & Kaufman\n(1999) present \u03b418O data for Neoproterozoic carbonates\nto indicate that values of less than \u22125 \u2030 (PDB) are\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\nEarly Neoproterozoic limestones from Anglesey 83\nFigure 6. Isotopic data for samples from the Trwyn y Parc megaclast (see Fig. 3 for location of samples).\nunlikely to represent primary isotopic signatures.\nTherefore the highly negative values observed in the\nGwna Group carbonates are considered to have resulted\nfrom modification of the primary seawater signature\nduring post-precipitation interaction with secondary\nfluids. Oxygen isotope composition is a sensitive indic-\nator of alteration processes, with a decrease in \u03b418O val-\nues typically resulting from interaction with meteoric or\nhydrothermal fluids. A range of oxygen isotope values\nacross a carbonate sequence might be anticipated as\na consequence of variable oxygen mobility linked to\ndiffering degrees of recrystallization, related to the\noriginal depth of burial. Such changes are controlled by\nthe primary carbonate texture and composition (Buick,\nDes Marais & Knoll, 1995). However, the megaclast\ndoes not show a unidirectional progressive variation\nin \u03b418O depletion, and the marginal isotopic values\nshow a correlation with the degree of dolomitization\non the margins of the megaclasts. This distribution\nof values is interpreted as representing two stages of\noxygen mobility. The significance of identifying these\ntwo stages of alteration is that values from one stage\nshow a correlation with \u03b413C values, thus indicating\nthat these values are also not primary isotopic values.\nThe first alteration event (resulting in values as\nlow as about \u221218.9 \u03b418O) overprinted the primary\ndepositional \u03b418O values in the carbonate. Possible\noptions for the derivation of the fluid involved are: (1)\nmeteoric water, (2) hydrothermally driven fluids and (3)\nlow-grade metamorphic fluids. The latter two options\nwould invoke alteration of the limestone blocks after\nincorporation into the m\u00e9lange, while textural evidence\nsuggests that this occurred prior to incorporation. Both\nhydrothermal alteration, as recorded from Avalonian\nNeoproterozoic plutonic rocks and Acadian low-grade\nmetamorphic fluids derived from the dehydration of\nmudrock within the Welsh Basin, can be reasonably\nruled out, as both are enriched in heavy oxygen and\nhave positive values (e.g. Beckinsale et al. 1984; Evans,\n1995).\nThis early alteration event was in turn overprinted\nby a less pervasive event linked to dolomitization of\nthe outer margins of the megaclast. The restricted\nmarginal alteration indicates that this event occurred\npost-emplacement of the carbonate block within the\nm\u00e9lange, with the overprinting recorded by a shift\nin \u03b418O from highly negative values (e.g. NMW 515\n\u221218.9 \u2030) to values of \u221215.7 \u2030 in the limestone and\n\u22129.2 to \u22128.7 \u2030 in the dolostones. These samples with\na second phase of oxygen mobility also show as positive\ncorrelation with Mn\/Sr.\nCarbon isotope systems may be less disturbed than\noxygen systems during diagenetic overprint through\nmeteoric or burial pathways, as the carbon in these\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\n84 J.

Age constraints on the Gwna Group limestone megaclast at Trwyn y Parc, based on seawater 87Sr\/86Sr values from the\nNeoproterozoic to Ordovician, from the data of Halverson et al. (2007) with comparative curves from Shields (1999) and Walter et al.\n(2000).\nfluids is derived dominantly from the precursor car-\nbonate phases (Jacobsen & Kaufman, 1999). However,\nthe range of carbon isotope values shown by the non-\ndolomitic limestone samples from the centre of the\nmegaclast (Fig. 6; NMW 541\u2013545, 0.2 to 1.9 \u03b413C \u2030\n(PDB)) show a positive correlation between \u03b418O and\n\u03b413C (Fig. 6d), suggesting that the primary values have\nbeen shifted from more positive values during the first\npervasive stage of alteration recorded by the highly\nnegative \u03b418O values in these samples.\nCritical to this study is the question of whether\nthe fluid interaction caused alteration, movement or\ncontamination of the strontium isotope composition.\nBecause of the large reservoir of Sr in limestone (444\u2013\n1198 ppm), it is relatively resistant to the effects of\ncontamination by interaction with fluids. The alteration\nmedium would need high concentrations of strontium\nor strontium with a very different isotopic composition\n(that is, highly radiogenic) in order to affect the\nbulk of the rock. Strontium concentration in ground\nwater is usually less than 1 ppm (Montgomery, Evans\n& Wildman, 2006). Hence, a water source of this\nkind, even at high water\u2013rock ratios, is unlikely to\nhave a significant effect on the bulk-rock isotope\ncomposition. The limited effects of interaction and\nisotopic exchange at the margins of the clasts, probably\nassociated with dolomitization, are shown in Figures 5\nand 6, whereas the centre of the clast retains low\nSr isotope values, high Sr ppm and low magnesium\ncontents. Consequently, the lowest Sr isotope values\nare taken as representative of the original seawater\ncomposition from which this limestone precipitated.\nThe three lowest isotopic Sr values measured from\nthe limestone are 0.70620, 0.70629 and 0.70635. High\nwhole-rock Sr and low Mn\/Sr (0.25\u20130.36) for these\nsamples supports interpretation of a primary 87Sr\/86Sr\nvalue in the range 0.7062\u20130.7064.\n7. Secular variation in isotopic Sr\nin seawater composition\nA synthesis of published isotopic Sr values for\ncarbonates of known ages has been used by various\nworkers to document variations in the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio\nof seawater through geological time. Data for the\nNeoproterozoic include the work of Asmerom et al.\n(1991), Kaufman, Jacobsen & Knoll (1993), Derry\net al. (1994), Nicholas (1996), Misi & Veizer (1998),\nJacobsen & Kaufman (1999), Brasier & Shields (2000),\nMonta\u00f1ez et al. (2000) and Melezhik et al. (2001).\nWhile these studies show a general overall trend of\nincreasing 87Sr\/86Sr, with minor incursions, through the\nCryogenian and Ediacaran, there are also significant\ndifferences in actual isotopic values for any given\npoint in time between studies. This is more marked\nin the Cryogenian as illustrated by the curves of Walter\net al. (2000) and Shields (1999) shown in Figure 7.\nThese differences are the product of the methods\nand geochemical values used to identify samples\nconsidered to represent primary 87Sr\/86Sr signatures,\nthe analytical precision of isotopic analyses, and the\nquality of palaeontological or isotopic data used to\ndetermine the age of the carbonates. The most recent\ncontribution by Halverson et al. (2007) presents a new\nseawater evolution curve for the Neoproterozoic that\nis based only on carbonate values that are considered\nto be close to original 87Sr\/86Sr of seawater. This was\nachieved through more rigorous evaluation of existing\npublished data, careful correlation between carbonate-\nbearing successions on the basis of \u03b413C values, and\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\nEarly Neoproterozoic limestones from Anglesey 85\nidentification of samples with well-constrained age\ndata, as well as new analyses from key areas.\n8. Comparison of Gwna Limestone\nto seawater curves\nThe lowest 87Sr\/86Sr values measured from the Gwna\nmegaclast carbonate samples lie in the range 0.7062\u2013\n0.7064. As these samples comply with the geochemical\ncriteria identified as indicative of minimal modification\nof primary seawater Sr isotope values, they can be\ncompared to the secular seawater curves for rocks of\nknown age. Comparison of these samples with the data\nof Halverson et al. (2007) provides a minimum age\nof deposition of c. 800 Ma (early Cryogenian), based\non data from the Grusdiev Formation, Akademiker-\nbreen Group, Svalbard (Fig. 7) (0.7062\u20130.7074), with\nyounger ages being precluded by the continued rise in\nseawater 87Sr\/86Sr through the Cryogenian. However,\nthese data do not provide a unique solution, as values in\nthe range 0.7061\u20130.7062 have been documented from\ncarbonates within the Little Dal Group, Mackenzie\nMountains Supergroup of NW Canada dated at 862\u2013\n868 Ma (Halverson et al. 2007). Carbonates from dif-\nferent sequences of early Neoproterozoic age have also\nbeen correlated on the basis of their \u03b413C signatures,\nand the combined use of \u03b413C and 87Sr\/86Sr data would\npotentially provide a means of distinguishing to which\nof these two age groups the Gwna Group carbonates\nequates most closely. However, it is unfortunate both\nthat the \u03b413C data for the two age groups overlap\n(Grusdiev \u22120.15 to 7.0 and Little Dal Group 4.0) and\nthat the \u03b413C values for the Gwna Group carbonates\nhave been modified during the early alteration event.\n9. Source of the megaclasts\nThe Gwna Group of Anglesey lies within the Eastern\nAvalonian terrane of southern Britain. Within the East-\nern Avalonian, or related peri-Gondwanan terranes,\ncarbonates are poorly represented, the Neoproterozoic\nsedimentary sequences being dominated by arc basinal\nvolcaniclastics and epiclastic deposits. In the type\nAvalonian area of Newfoundland, these deposits have\nbeen related to four main phases of magmatic arc\nactivity spanning the period 760\u2013545 Ma (O\u2019Brian\net al. 1992). Similar phases of activity can also be\nidentified in southern Britain from c. 677 Ma to 560 Ma\n(Gibbons & Hor\u00e1k, 1996). On the basis of the Sr\nchemostratigraphy it is established that the Gwna\nGroup megaclast limestone is older than any rocks\nexposed in southern Britain, and represents one of\nthe earliest records of deposition found within the\nAvalonian terrane.\nWithin the broader peri-Gondwana\u2013Avalonian set-\nting, the Green Head Group of the Brookville Terrane,\nNew Brunswick, contains rocks of late Tonian to\nearly Cryogenian age (White & Barr, 1996). This\nis interpreted as a passive margin sequence and\nincludes carbonate rocks within the Ashburn Formation\nof that group. Although much of this deposit has\nundergone metamorphism and ductile deformation,\nMatthew (1890) described the columnar stromatolite\nArchaeozoon acadiens from less deformed parts of the\nsequence. More recently, Hofmann (pers. comm. cited\nin White & Barr, 1996) has indicated that these suggest\na Tonian to Cryogenian age for the carbonates with an\nage of 750\u2013880 Ma. Although the Ashburn Formation\ncarbonates provide a tantalizing correlative for the\nGwna Group limestones, no comparable geochemical\nor isotopic data are available at present for this unit.\nHowever, the potential for a link between these two\ncarbonate sequences merits a re-examination of the\nGwna stromatolites.\nPalaeomagnetic data for Avalonian rocks suggest a\nposition of around 30\u25e6 S during the late Neoproterozoic\n(580 to 603 Ma) (McNamara et al. 2001; Vizan et al.\n2003), and a slightly lower latitude for the Burin\nGroup of Newfoundland (763 Ma: Krogh et al. 1988)\nconstrains the earliest position known for Avalonia\n(McCausland et al. 2008). The presence of ooids\nwithin the Gwna carbonates may indicate deposition\nin warmer water at low latitude, although this should\nnot be taken as conclusive evidence without additional\ncorroboration. James et al. (2005) have documented\nooids from Neoproterozoic sequences within cold\nwater carbonates and suggest that higher marine\ncarbonate saturation before the evolution of skeletal\ncarbonate biota implies that Neoproterozoic ooids may\nhave formed across the neritic palaeoenvironmental\nspectrum, from polar to tropical settings. As no\npalaeomagnetic data are available for Avalonian rock\nof equivalent age to the Gwna Group limestone,\nthe latitude of deposition remains unconstrained.\nThe 87Sr\/86Sr signature, however, does indicate that\nthese carbonates are derived from the pre-glacial\nNeoproterozoic, and therefore cannot be cap carbonate\ndeposits, as such low Sr isotope values have only ever\nbeen reported from the pre-glacial Neoproterozoic (e.g.\nHalverson et al. 2007).\nA significant Neoproterozoic carbonate component\nis also present within the thick sequence of the\nDalradian Supergroup of Scotland and stromatolitic\ncarbonates have been identified within the shallow-\nwater Bonahaven Dolomite Formation (lower Argyll\nGroup), above the Port Askaig Tillite Formation\n(Fairchild, 1980). This tillite has been attributed to\nthe Sturtian glaciation which Halverson et al. (2007)\nbracket with 87Sr\/86Sr values of 0.7067\u20130.7069. As the\nvalues for the Gwna Group limestone are considerably\nlower, this undermines the basis for a correlation\nbetween these limestone units. Thomas et al. (2004)\nhave recorded a significantly lower 87Sr\/86Sr value of\n0.7064 from the Dufftown Limestone (Ballachulish\nSubgroup, Appin Group), lower in the Dalradian\nsuccession. This indicates that it was deposited around\n800 Ma, and is supported by low \u03b413C values that\nappear to equate to the c. 800 Ma Bitter Springs\nanomaly (Prave et al. 2009). Although the Argyll\nGroup carbonates might provide a potential correlative\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 05 Jan 2011 IP address: 192.171.148.35\n86 J. M . H O R \u00c1 K & J. A . E VA N S\nor source for the Gwna Group m\u00e9lange limestone\nblocks, the interbedded siliciclastic units indicate that\nthese were deposited in a deep-water setting (Prave\net al. 2009). Any association with the Dalradian\nsuccession would require the Gwna Group carbonates\nto be deposited close to the Laurentian margin with\nsubsequent transfer to the Avalonian\/peri-Gondwana\nterranes prior to the opening of Iapetus c. 600\u2013560 Ma\n(Cawood et al. 2001; Li et al. 2008).\n10. Conclusions\n(1) The Sr isotopic data presented in this paper establish\nan early Neoproterozoic Cryogenian (c. 800 Ma) or\nTonian (860 Ma) age for the limestone megaclasts\nwithin the Gwna Group m\u00e9lange of Northern Anglesey,\nand suggest that the age range for the stromatolites\nreported by Wood & Nicholls (1973) and Muir et al.\n(1979) is too young. Further study of the stromatolites\nshould enable the original taxonomic work to be\nrefined.\n(2) Early Neoproterozoic rocks have not been\ndocumented from southern Britain prior to this study,\nthe oldest rocks recorded being the Malvern Complex\nplutonic rocks (677 \u00b1 2 Ma U\u2013Pb zircon: Tucker\n& Pharaoh, 1991) and the metapelite schist from\nAnglesey (666 \u00b1 7 Ma, U\u2013Pb zircon: Strachan et al.\n2007). No evidence exists to suggest that the Gwna\nGroup limestone was derived from a source in southern\nBritain. The restricted distribution of the m\u00e9lange\nin northwestern Wales is more suggestive of a deriv-\nation from a source outboard of the main Avalonian\nmagmatic arc.\n(3) The depositional ages for the Gwna limestone\nmegaclast derived from the Sr chemostratigraphy\nstrengthen the potential correlation between the Gwna\nGroup limestone and the Greenhead Group (Ashburn\nFormation) of New Brunswick. Such a correlation\nwould also constrain the timing of m\u00e9lange forma-\ntion, as the Ashburn Formation underwent regional\ngreenschist metamorphism at 560 Ma (White & Barr,\n1996) and the Gwna limestone appears not to have\nexceeded anchizone conditions, which would imply in-\ncorporation into the m\u00e9lange prior to this metamorphic\nevent. In addition, if the interpretation of Kawai et al.\n(2006) that the Gwna Group in SE Anglesey was\nmetamorphosed to greenschist facies during the event\nthat produced the Anglesey blueschists at 550\u2013560 Ma\n(Dallmayer & Gibbons, 1987) is correct, then the\nminimum age of m\u00e9lange formation must pre-date\n550\u2013560 Ma.\n(4) Interpretation of a Neoproterozoic age for the\nGwna Group m\u00e9lange has implications for the accepted\nstratigraphy of the Monian Supergroup. The early\nPalaeozoic age for the basal part of the succession,\nthe South Stack Group and the overlying New Harbour\nGroup, established by Collins & Buchan (2004), is now\nincompatible with the Gwna Group constituting the top\nunit of this succession. This suggests that the Gwna\nGroup does not belong to the Monian Supergroup\nand that the stratigraphy of the group requires re-\nexamination.\nAcknowledgements.
