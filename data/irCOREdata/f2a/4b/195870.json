This paper reports findings from a national \nevaluation of intermediate care, focusing on the relationship between hospital services \nand intermediate care. \n \nMethods: The evaluation was based on a survey of intermediate care co-ordinators, \ncase studies with five \u201ewhole systems\u201f (Primary Care Trust areas) of intermediate \ncare, and a systematic review of evidence for the effectiveness of intermediate care.  \nThis paper reports some findings from the case study work, drawing on interviews \nand focus groups with key managers and practitioners involved in the planning, \nmanagement and delivery of intermediate care.  Participants were asked about the \ndevelopment of intermediate care, the role and purpose of intermediate care, the \norganisation and management of intermediate care, strengths and weaknesses of \nintermediate care, relationships between intermediate care services and between \nintermediate care and \u201emainstream\u201f services, and future areas for development.  The \ndata were analysed using the framework approach. \n \n 3 \nResults: Respondents identified a range of tensions between hospital services and \nintermediate care, including concerns about the role and involvement of acute \nclinicians; the safety, quality and appropriateness of intermediate care; access to and \neligibility for intermediate care; a lack of understanding and awareness of \nintermediate care; and the risk of intermediate care being dominated by acute \npressures. \n \nConclusions: Although participants were able to identify several practical ways \nforward, resolving such fundamental tensions seems to require significant and long-\nterm cultural change in the relationship between acute and intermediate care. \n \n \n 4 \n \nOlder people and the relationship between hospital services \nand intermediate care: results from a national evaluation \n \nBackground and Introduction \n \nTackling delayed hospital discharge is currently a key government priority in the UK, \nwith ministerial pledges to end widespread \u201ebed blocking\u201f (1).  To achieve this target, \nthe Labour government has introduced a range of measures, including additional \nfunding for health and social care and the introduction of new legislation (the \nCommunity Care (Delayed Discharges etc.) Act 2003) to charge social services \ndepartments for hospital beds unnecessarily \u201eblocked\u201f by people awaiting social \nservices provision (a system known as reimbursement).  While hospital discharge has \nlong been a problematic area of policy and practice (2), hospital admission has tended \nto receive less attention (until relatively recently).  This is now beginning to change, \nhowever, with a growing focus on reducing emergency admissions and supporting \npeople with long-term conditions (3).  As a result of this, there are now national \ntargets to reduce admissions, new case managers to maintain people with complex \nneeds in the community, and a range of different admission avoidance schemes in \nplace throughout the country.   \n \nFor many commentators, the key to tackling delayed discharge and reducing \nemergency admissions is to increase the amount of rehabilitation and recuperation \n 5 \navailable, particularly for frail older people who tend to account for significant \nproportions of emergency admissions (4).  As the Audit Commission suggests (5), \nolder people\u201fs services often experience a \u201evicious circle\u201f (see figure 1).  As the \nnumber of hospital admissions rises, lengths of hospital stays decline, opportunities \nfor rehabilitation are reduced, there is an increased use of expensive \nresidential\/nursing home care and less money for preventative services, thereby \nleading to more hospital admissions.   \n \nTake in figure 1 \n \nAgainst this background, the development of intermediate care services has been \npromoted as one means of breaking out of the Audit Commission\u201fs \u201evicious circle\u201f \nand delivering on the government\u201fs commitment to joint working, prevention of \nunnecessary admissions and delayed discharges, and promoting independence.  In \n2000, The NHS Plan announced an extra \u00a3900 million to be invested over four years \nin intermediate care services such as rapid response teams, intensive rehabilitation \nservices, recuperation facilities and integrated home care teams (1, 6).  Although \ndetails were scarce at this stage, intermediate care was essentially designed to prevent \nunnecessary hospital admissions, facilitate swift and timely hospital discharges and \nprevent premature admissions to permanent residential and nursing care.  While the \nterm \u201eintermediate care\u201f is a broad one that is used to refer to a wide range of diverse \nservices (including rapid response, Hospital at Home, step-up and step-down care \nhome places, supported discharge, and residential\/day rehabilitation), the essential \ncharacteristics shared by such services were subsequently set out in a government \n 6 \ncircular (7), with intermediate care described as services that met all the criteria in \nfigure 2. \n \nTake in figure 2 \n \nWhether the advent of intermediate care has the potential to break the Audit \nCommission\u201fs \u201evicious circle\u201f may very much depend on the relationship between \nexisting acute hospital services and new intermediate care provision.  Just as in the \npast there have been well documented tensions between community and acute care \n(2), there is clearly scope for similar tensions to emerge in intermediate care, and the \nability of new services to act as a genuine alternative to and bridge out of hospital will \nbe significant.  Against this background, this paper reports findings from a national \nevaluation of intermediate care relating to the emerging relationship between acute \nand intermediate care services. \n \n \nMethods \nThis paper reports findings from qualitative research undertaken by a team from the \nUniversities of Birmingham and Leicester as part of a national evaluation of \nintermediate care.  Commissioned by the Department of Health and the Medical \nResearch Council, the evaluation lasted from January 2002 to June 2005.  The \nresearch aims (set out in figure 3) were addressed via a range of research activities, \nincluding a questionnaire survey of intermediate care co-ordinators (Aims 1 & 2), \ncase studies with \u201ewhole systems\u201f of intermediate care (Aims 3 & 4), and a systematic \n 7 \nreview of evidence for effectiveness of intermediate care (Aim 5).  Five (Primary \nCare Trust-based) case study sites were included in the study, selected to include a \nmix of rural and urban areas where there has been a range of intermediate care \nservices operational for at least 2-3 years, reasonable throughput into the intermediate \ncare system (at least 1000 cases per annum), senior management support for the \ncollection of routine data by services themselves, and clinical and managerial support \nfor participation in the national evaluation. \n \nTake in figure 3 \n \nAlongside quantitative data collection for economic analysis, in each area interviews \n(n=61) and focus groups (n=21) were held with key managers and practitioners \ninvolved in the planning, management and delivery of intermediate care.  This \nincluded respondents from primary care, intermediate care, acute care and social \nservices, together with focus groups with front-line staff.  In both interviews and \nfocus groups participants were asked about the background to the development of \nintermediate care services, the role and purpose of intermediate care, the organisation \nand management of intermediate care, strengths and weaknesses of intermediate care, \nrelationships between intermediate care services (and between intermediate care and \n\u201emainstream\u201f services), and future areas for development.  All interviews took place \nin private after written consent had been sought and interviewees had been given \nassurances of anonymity (data being presented in a non-attributable form).   \nInterviews and focus-group discussions were tape-recorded and transcribed.  The data \nwere analysed using a method informed by the framework approach which involves \n 8 \nthe sifting, charting and sorting of material in a systematic process according to key \nissues and themes (8).  As a result of this, key themes were identified from the data \nand subsequently discussed and validated at regular research team meetings.  This \npaper focuses on data from interviews and focus groups, and explores data relating to \nthe relationship between acute care and intermediate care. \n \n \nFindings \n \nIntermediate care as part of a spectrum of services and as a positive alternative to \nhospital \n \nFor many people, the development of intermediate care had initially been driven by \nthe need to do things differently in order to reduce pressures on acute care.  This was \nhighlighted by a range of different respondents, including those from acute care, \nintermediate care and social care, and including both managers and clinicians.  In \nparticular, many respondents saw intermediate care as a positive concept with the \npotential to promote choice, independence and quality of life.  For some, this \ncontrasted significantly with the dependency culture which they felt existed in some \nacute settings, and could lead to older people returning to independent living in the \ncommunity in a way in which stretched hospital services would not be able to \nachieve.  In particular, the success of intermediate care was felt to hinge on the \nflexibility and choice it could offer as part of a wider spectrum of services for older \npeople (see 9 for further discussion). \n \n 9 \nIn addition, a key feature of intermediate care was its capacity to invest time and \nresources in older people to help them regain their independence.  Based outside \nhospital and in as homely an environment as possible, this was seen as preparing \npeople to return home and as giving as realistic an insight as possible into people\u201fs \nself-care abilities in less institutional settings (see 10 for further discussion). \n \n \nDifficulties in the relationship with acute care: issues for hospital staff \n \nDespite these positive perceptions of intermediate care, some staff felt that local \nintermediate care services had been set up too quickly with insufficient input from \nhospital staff.  For some, intermediate care represented a new project that took \nfunding and focus away from existing good practice, and new services too often took \nthe form of short-term, standalone projects, insufficiently linked to mainstream \nservices: \n \n\u201c[Intermediate care] is still perceived as a bit of an add on and to a certain extent we \nstill have a legacy of these projects and short termisms, and the difficulty with that is \nwhen you are working with the public or service users around intermediate care that \nkind of impacts on your working relationship because we don\u201ft want any more \nprojects, we don\u201ft want anymore short term things, we want something that is going \nto be available on an ongoing basis.\u201d (site 5) \n \n \u201cI\u201fve been around far too long, I\u201fve seen so many new schemes come and go at the \nexpense of good sound practice\u2026  [Sometimes it\u201fs not because existing schemes \n 10 \naren\u201ft working well, but because] the government likes to have new money going to \nnew schemes and these new schemes [are] at the expense of [existing] good \npractice.\u201d  (site 2) \n \nFor some, these concerns were also linked to fears that intermediate care might \nrepresent a lower quality form of service for older people and that new models of \nservice provision had been set up in advance of an appropriate evidence base.  There \nwere also concerns that clinicians in hospital settings may end up focusing solely on \nacute care and losing sight of the whole person, although some respondents felt that \nthis constituted a more appropriate use of expensive acute capacity.  For some \nclinicians, moreover, there was also a worrying trend towards avoiding the need for \nspecialists \u2013 partly due to a desire to save money, but also through a desire to reduce \nmedical power:  \n \n \u201cI also feel there is a feeling amongst management in the sense that we must actually \navoid specialists\u2026 and that means the care will be cheap.  It is not, it may become \nmore expensive. The specialists are there \u2026 because\u2026  they can actually\u2026 get a \nbetter outcome for the patients, not for \u201eoh yes the control\u201f.  There are some doctors, \nthey are not geriatricians themselves, a lot of them feel the old school were \ndictatorial, but modern doctors are not dictatorial, they want to work in a \nmultidisciplinary [team], but if you actually want to avoid them and then develop \npockets of services and other things it would be a disaster.\u201d (site 1) \n \nIn some services, moreover, there was a feeling that intermediate care was under-\nused, with intermediate care services were regarded as somehow \u201eseparate\u201f or \u201eother\u201f \n 11 \nfrom mainstream provision.  As a result, interviewees reported that many hospital \nstaff (and indeed GPs too) lacked awareness and understanding of intermediate care \nservices.  Despite numerous attempts to promote intermediate care locally, \ninterviewees reported that the concept had simply failed to become embedded within \nthe mindsets of many mainstream practitioners.  The rotation of hospital staff \ncombined with pressures upon staff to find quick solutions were suggested as possible \nreasons for this: \n \n\u201cI just think people don\u201ft think about it naturally as it is fairly new.  Services have \nbeen limited and where they are they are probably working at capacity because they \nare so limited so thinking of a route through intermediate care as an alternative to \nadmitting somebody or discharge them into long-term care, people just don\u201ft think \nabout it.\u201d (site 2) \n \nIn particular, key barriers included the gradual evolution of intermediate care (with \ndifferent access points and eligibility criteria) and access criteria perceived by \nmainstream practitioners as being too restrictive.  As a result, intermediate care could \nby seen by some as being rather detached from mainstream services, sometimes \n\u201echerry-picking\u201f patients.  In addition, ongoing difficulties in making referrals to \nintermediate care could result in practitioners reverting to other forms of service \nprovision: \n \n\u201cWell the units \u2026 do develop criteria, don\u201ft they, because they have to safeguard \nthemselves by having so many exclusions that actually they become almost impossible \nto use because busy clinicians can\u201ft maintain all the exclusion criteria at their \n 12 \nfingertips.  And if you refer and are rejected, refer and are rejected, next time you see \na case you\u201fre going to think well, we\u201fll do it as we always used to do.\u201d (site 1) \n \n \nDifficulties in the relationship with acute care: issues for intermediate care staff \n \nWhile there was general consensus about many of the issues for hospital staff set out \nabove, some acute medical staff were also seen as resistant to change and as reluctant \nto refer to intermediate care for fear of losing control of their patients, and due to an \nill-knowledge of what was available (which was not helped by frequent staff \nchanges): \n \n\u201cI think the other thing is that I would like to see is that my colleagues in the hospital \nsetting\u2026  feel more integrated with the intermediate care set up, which they don\u201ft at \nthe moment\u2026  They don\u201ft understand what is out there and it is just so difficult to \nkeep people up to speed with new developments and changes.\u201d (site 5) \n \n\u201cNo I don\u201ft think safety is a problem, no.  They just, I think these particular two \n[doctors] do not want to lose control of their patients. I think they see it as a threat, \ntheir patients going to somebody else, to a different Consultant.\u201d (site 1) \n \nIn addition, hospital services more generally were felt not to understand the nature of \nintermediate care, and there were concerns that intermediate care could become too \ndominated by a desire to reduce acute pressures: \n \n 13 \n[We get inappropriate referrals, particularly when there\u201fs] a bed panic, like there is \ntoday, and everybody will be told to go through the ward and find any patients and \nthere will almost be a blanket referral [to intermediate care] for virtually anybody \nwho is vaguely upright.\u201d (site 1) \n \n\u201cI personally think we are perceived as someone that can empty a hospital bed and \nnot as a continuation of the care.\u201d (site 5) \n \nEven where intermediate care reported a good relationship with the local hospital, \ncomments from respondents sometimes suggested underlying misunderstandings of \neach other\u201fs role: \n \n\u201cWe have built up a very good working relationship with [the] Hospital.  I think the \ngirls like the idea of having us at the back to polish up the bits they feel could be \npolished up but they haven\u201ft got the time to do.\u201d  (site 4) \n \nAt the same time, there were also anecdotal and individual concerns that intermediate \ncare beds in one site in particular were becoming \u201eblocked\u201f, with people discharged \nprematurely from hospital and no follow-up services to enable timely discharge from \nintermediate care.  This was felt to be the result of a range of factors, including a lack \nof capacity in the home care and care home sector. \n \nOften, intermediate care staff felt under pressure to accept as many referrals as \npossible, even if they suspected that some were inappropriate.  As a new service, \ntrying to win over the hearts and minds of staff in social, primary and acute care, \n 14 \nsome services felt that they had to be as helpful as possible to potential referrers and \nhad to ensure that their beds were as full as possible to justify a need for their service: \n \n\u201cAnd one of the real hard things for Intermediate Care is that they are damned if they \ndo and damned if they don\u201ft all the time, at the moment.  So the minute we have no \nvacancies in the beds, people start jumping up and down.  And then the minute we \nhave vacancies in the beds they jump up and down for the opposite reason. If we can\u201ft \naccept somebody onto the team from the community they jump up and down.  If we get \nit wrong and have a problem because we accept somebody we shouldn\u201ft have \naccepted, or whatever\u2026    And that at times is very hard for the people trying to \ndeliver. Because they do feel shot at from all directions.\u201d (site 1) \n \n\u201cThere is a pressure to use Intermediate Care services for things not fit for purpose.  \nWe are already being asked to put people in Intermediate Care places where there \nactually is not an Intermediate Care element to that.  It is to get this person out of \nacute hospital bed.\u201d (site 2) \n \nThis task of winning over potential referrers was made more complex in one site as a \nresult of the existence of two community hospitals, which tended to be much more \nregularly used by the local hospital than intermediate care.  While some intermediate \ncare services felt that they were sometimes seen as a means of relieving pressures in \nacute care, therefore, other services felt that they were under-utilised and were eager \nto receive more referrals: \n \n 15 \n\u201cWe are not getting as many hospital discharges as we could have because of the \nclose proximity to the two community hospitals, certainly in the past, it is easier for \nthe staff on the acute hospital ward to just transfer straight across than to sort out \nhow to make the access to Intermediate Care and set that up.  We have probably not \nbeen utilised as much as we could have been and that still goes on.\u201d  (site 3) \n \nOverall, however, concerns from community staff about the dominance and practices \nof acute services were a recurring theme.  As one person put it, \u201cthey are wary that \nthey are a dumping ground for secondary care\u201d (site 1).  In response, participants \nsuggested a number of ways forward that might help to ease tensions.  In particular, \nrespondents emphasised the need for greater geriatrician involvement in intermediate \ncare to reassure hospital clinicians about the safety and quality of services; joint work \nto review eligibility criteria so that these are jointly owned and disseminated \nthroughout both primary and acute care; and the creation of joint, rotational posts, \nwith practitioners working in both intermediate care and acute settings.  In addition, \nvarious sites emphasised the need for accessible information and publicity material to \nraise awareness, and for more proactive case-finding and in-reach into hospital (for \nexample, with intermediate care taking full part in discharge meetings, diverting \nadmissions from A&E etc).  However, underlying all these proposals was a sense that \nmajor cultural change will be required if hospital services and intermediate care are to \nwork together more effectively in the future: \n \n\u201cThe big cultural thing we found in particular about the intermediate care beds is \nhospital staff being prepared to take the risk and discharge somebody to something \nnew that is relatively untested and unknown\u2026 So it is starting to overcome those \n 16 \nbarriers.  Part of it is actually once somebody has put a patient through intermediate \ncare then they have got the confidence to do it again.\u201d (site 4) \n \n \u201cI think the interface between primary and secondary care is a concept and it doesn\u201ft \nfunction really, other than as a place of passing people from one to the other by \npaper, or e-mail or whatever.   I think our view is that you will only get a real \ninterface if it\u201fs a working environment where there is some sort of working link \nbetween people in the community and people in hospital so that you can start to \ndevelop an understanding between clinicians of what is possible and so you can have \nsome commonality about risk sharing and risk management\u2026\u201d (site 2) \n \n \nDiscussion and Conclusions  \n \nPart of a national evaluation of intermediate care, this paper has highlighted a number \nof significant tensions between acute and intermediate care.  While participants from \ndifferent professional and organisational backgrounds have different views, key issues \ninclude concerns about the role and involvement of acute clinicians in intermediate \ncare; the safety, quality and appropriateness of intermediate care for some older \npeople; access to and eligibility for intermediate care; a lack of understanding and \nawareness of intermediate care; and the risk of intermediate care being dominated by \nacute pressures.  At times, this seems to be very much a case of opposites \u2013 some \nservices feeling the need to respond to acute pressures while others feel under-\nutilised; sometimes receiving inappropriate referrals but feeling the need to accept as \nmany referrals as possible in order to embed the new service. \n 17 \n  \nLocal context often accounts for these contrasts, for example the existence of \nalternative discharge arrangements which bypass intermediate care, as well as the \ndifferentiation between services and between sites.  Variation in intermediate care \nprovision within and between sites meant that some services were trusted partners of \nacute care clinicians, others were subject to overflows of inappropriate acute patients \nas they became \u201eholding bays\u201f at times of pressure on hospital beds, while still others \nstruggled to establish relationships with acute care and secure appropriate referrals in \nthe first place.  In part this was attributed to the effectiveness of information provision \nand communication, although it also seemed that hospital doctors were more willing \nto entrust the clinical safety of their patients to some services than others.  This also \nserves as a reminder that many of the suggestions made by respondents above, about \nimproving acute-intermediate care relationships, are likely to be fraught with political \ndifficulties and clinical concerns, especially those which countenanced anything \napproaching a transfer of responsibility for hospital patients\u201f safety.  \n \nWhile participants in the study had a range of practical suggestions as to how they \nmight begin to the issues raised, many were long-term and depended on a series of \nrelatively small-scale approaches that might in time begin to bring about the cultural \nchange required to improve the relationship between intermediate care and hospital \nservices.  With a 2006 White Paper focusing on the need to develop \u201ecare closer to \nhome\u201f (11) and with national targets to reduce emergency admissions, however, it is \nnot clear whether intermediate care has this amount of time available to it (or indeed \nthe power to tackle vested acute care interests). \n \n 18 \nPerhaps in the long-run, the best way forward may be to focus more on providing the \nresources necessary to achieve swift and safe discharge and to focus on the whole \nsystem, not just on one part of it.  Such an approach might well require additional \nfunding for community services, possibly in conjunction with disinvestment in acute \ncare.  Above all, it would place greater emphasis on discharge practices in acute care.  \nFrom existing literature, we know that some acute hospitals fail to plan ahead for \ndischarge, do not adequately involve service users and their carers in decisions about \ndischarge and aftercare, and do not give sufficient notice to users\/carers and other \nservices (2, 12-16).   Viewed from this perspective, finding the best way of facilitating \npositive relationships between acute services and intermediate care may well be a \ncrucial aspect of current attempts to tackle delayed discharge and rising emergency \nadmissions. \n \nOverall, this insight into the relationship between hospital discharge and intermediate \ncare raises significant concerns about the extent to which new intermediate care \nservices \u2013 so widely heralded in 2000 \u2013 have the capacity to rebalance the current \nhealth and social care system and make significant inroads into current emergency \nadmission and delayed discharge rates.  Whilst intermediate care may remain a \npositive step forward with considerable potential, there is a danger that this potential \nmay not be fully realised unless some of the tensions and barriers identified in this \npaper are resolved.   \n 19 \nReferences \n \n1.
