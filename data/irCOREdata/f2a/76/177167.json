INTRODUCTION  \n1.1 Background \nThe Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) was developed as an aid to understanding \npeople\u2019s perceptions about medicines(1), and their adherence (or non-adherence) to \nprescribed medication regimes(2). Its development was one response to mounting evidence \nthat many patients do not use their medicines as directed by the prescriber(3). Estimates of the \nextent of non-adherence vary across studies, largely because of differing methods of \nmeasurement, difficulties in measuring and inconsistency in the definitions used for the term \n\u2018adherence\u2019(4). However, one source reports that across different definitions and settings, \naround 50% of medicines are not used as intended by the prescriber(5). Non-adherence to \nprescribed medicines can pose a significant threat to the success of medical treatments and \nintended improvements in health outcomes. Adherence to evidence-based curative or \npreventive drug treatments for most medical conditions is likely to affect the success of those \ntreatments, since maintaining optimal blood levels is necessary for efficacy.\n \n Poor health \noutcomes following low adherence can in turn impinge on secondary outcomes, such as the \ncost to society of subsequent unresolved and\/or worsening illnesses.  \nVarious reasons for low adherence have been reported, and these can be categorised as non-\nintentional and intentional non-adherence. Non-intentional non-adherence is often the result \nof poor memory or understanding(5). The reasons for intentional non-adherence are less \nstraightforward and include problems experienced as a direct result of taking medicines (such \nas adverse drug reactions), inability to pay for medicines, disagreement with the need for \n 5 \npharmacological treatment, or other patient-specific issues associated with complex \nbehavioural characteristics (6)\n \n. Beliefs about medicines are most likely to be associated with \nintentional non-adherence. \nPreviously, a number of theories from health psychology such as the Health Belief Model, \nTheory of Planned Behaviour and the Common Sense Self-regulatory Model of Illness, have \nbeen used to try to explain variation in adherence to medicines(7). The authors of the BMQ, \nhowever, argued that a separate, specific measure to gauge patients\u2019 beliefs about medicines \nwould add to the explanatory power of such models(1). It was proposed that an enhanced \nunderstanding of people\u2019s beliefs about medicines could inform the development of \ninterventions to improve adherence and optimise the benefits users derive from their \nmedicines. It is unclear, however, whether these beliefs are stable over time, or whether they \nchange depending on concurrent circumstances. \n \nThe BMQ comprises two separate scales(1). The BMQ-Specific scale has two sub-scales and \nassesses respondents\u2019 beliefs about prescribed medicines that they are currently using for \nspecific conditions, for example, hypertension, diabetes or asthma. Studies using the BMQ-\nSpecific sub-scales have shown that respondents with stronger beliefs about the necessity of \ntheir medication and fewer concerns about their medication (as measured by the BMQ) are \nmore likely to use their medicines as recommended by the prescriber(2, 8-11).  \n \nThe BMQ-General scale measures respondents\u2019 attitudes to medicines in general. It has two \nsub-scales, each with four items. The General-overuse sub-scale measures respondents\u2019 \nbeliefs about the extent to which medicines are overused or over-prescribed by doctors. The \nGeneral-harm sub-scale assesses beliefs about the harmfulness of medicines. Items are scored \n 6 \nusing a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate stronger beliefs about the corresponding \nconcepts in each sub-scale, i.e. more negative beliefs about medicines. Scores for each of the \nBMQ\u2013General sub-scales can range from 4 to 20. The BMQ-General scale has been used \nseparately to assess attitudes towards medicines among people who do not share a common \ncondition or treatment. For example, one study in Sweden suggested that pharmaceutical \nspecialists (pharmacists and prescriptionists) had fewer concerns than patients that medicines \nwere harmful or overused(12). Horne et al have reported that pharmacy students have a more \npositive attitude towards medicines than students studying other subjects(13), and that beliefs \nabout medicines vary between people from different cultural backgrounds(14). A recent \nSwedish study found that adherence was associated with general attitudes to medicines (as \nmeasured by the BMQ-General scale); people who believed that medicines were harmful \nwere less likely to take medicines as intended by the prescriber(15).   \n \n1.2 Temporal stability of beliefs about medicines \nTemporal stability is a property of a construct (e.g. beliefs about medicines) which indicates \nwhether the construct changes over time, or under different conditions; for example, whether \nbeliefs about medicines are stable or change in response to changes in health state. This would \nbe important to know because where such beliefs are associated with behaviour (in this \nexample, medicine-taking behaviour), and where that behaviour is maladaptive (such as low \nadherence), changing the behaviour using interventions that target beliefs may be harder to \nachieve when those beliefs are very stable. Previous researchers have proposed that health \nbeliefs (including some related to medicines use) are formed at an early age and change little \nthereafter(16). This US study compared the health beliefs and behaviours of 270 children, \nallocated to two groups depending on age (\u201811years and over\u2019 and \u2018under 11 years\u2019). Their \nfindings seemed to indicate that \u201cchildren\u2019s health related beliefs and behaviors are \n 7 \nrelatively stable\u201d by the time they reach 9-10 years, and that \u201cfew changes take place in these \norientations as the children move into adolescence\u201d. It is unknown however, whether this \nstability persists into adulthood, or whether experiences such as changes in health status, are \nlikely to modify health-related beliefs in later life. \n \n1.3 Aim \n The aim of this paper is to compare the results of two separate applications of the BMQ-\nGeneral scale in the same respondents, over a period of almost four years, in order to explore \nthe temporal stability of BMQ scores. The hypothesis was that scores for the two BMQ-\nGeneral sub-scales would remain stable over time (suggesting stability of people\u2019s general \nbeliefs about medicines) and would not alter with changes in health state. \n \n2. METHOD \nThe BMQ-General sub-scales were included in a postal questionnaire, mailed in 2002 to 3000 \nindividuals randomly selected from the Scottish electoral roll as part of a study about non-\nprescribed analgesics(17). The wording of the introductory text preceding the BMQ items was \nadapted slightly from the original(1) for this study (Box 1). As well as the BMQ-General, the \nquestionnaire collected information about respondents\u2019 characteristics, their lifestyle and \nrecent (within the previous two weeks) use of prescribed and non-prescribed medicines. \nRespondents were also asked to rate their general health using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging \nfrom excellent to poor.  \n \nThe BMQ-General scale was administered again 44 months later in 2005. It was incorporated \ninto a discrete choice experiment (DCE) questionnaire that measured relative preferences for \ndifferent ways of managing flu-like symptoms(18). This questionnaire was mailed to 652 \n 8 \nrespondents to the original survey who had agreed to participate in further research. The \nquestionnaire collected similar demographic and lifestyle information as before, and asked \nrespondents to again rate their general health using the same question as in 2002. Both \nquestionnaires are available on request from the authors. Respondents\u2019 personal \ncharacteristics were compared with other statistics describing the Scottish population using \nthe \u03c72\n \n test. \nBMQ-General sub-scale scores were calculated for the two time points (2002 and 2005) and \ncompared using a paired t-test. This test compares the means of two related samples when the \ndifference between the two groups is Normally distributed. Further comparisons were made \nof the scores of individuals for each item of the sub-scales at the two time points using the \nWilcoxon signed ranks test. This tests for differences between two related samples where the \nvariable of interest (in this case, the BMQ item score) is measured on an interval scale.  \n \nRespondents were divided into three mutually exclusive groups: those whose self-reported \nhealth status had improved or deteriorated (by at least one point on the Likert scale), or \nremained the same at the two time points (2002 and 2005). Mean differences in BMQ scores \nat the two time points were compared for the three groups using one-way analysis of variance \n(ANOVA), a test for Normally distributed data when there are more than two groups to \ncompare.  \n \n3. RESULTS \nIn total, 292 subjects were excluded from the 2002 survey because the questionnaire could not \nbe delivered (n=257) or the addressee was unable to participate (n=35) because they no longer \nlived in Scotland, were under 18 years of age or were deceased.  Removing these subjects \n 9 \nfrom the denominator, we had an adjusted response rate of 55% (n=1501\/2708). In the 2005 \nsurvey, after excluding 70 subjects whose questionnaire could not be delivered and nine who \nwere unable to participate because they were not resident in Scotland, were nursing home \nresidents, suffered from dementia or were deceased\n \n, the adjusted response rate was 57% \n(n=326\/573). A total of 321 respondents to the 2005 survey had scores available for \ncomparison with General-overuse scores from the 2002 survey, and 320 paired scores were \navailable for the General-harm sub-scale. Missing data for the remaining cases meant that \nBMQ scores could not be calculated. The characteristics of respondents with at least one \navailable paired BMQ-General score are given in Table 1. Compared to other statistics for \nScotland, the respondents had a lower proportion of younger people, smokers and drinkers of \nalcohol (p<0.001). \nThe BMQ-General sub-scale scores for respondents at each survey and differences between \nthe two time points are summarised in Table 2. BMQ scores for both sub-scales and the \ndifferences between scores over time were Normally distributed. The paired samples t-test \nrevealed no significant differences in the mean scores between both time points, for either \nsub-scale (Table 2). Results of the Wilcoxon signed ranks test which compared the scores of \nindividuals on each of the eight items in the BMQ-General over time, are shown in Table 3. \nThe number of paired observations for each of the eight items varied between 316 and 323 \nbecause of missing data. There were no statistically significant differences for six of the eight \nitems in the scale. The difference between scores for \u2018Doctors use too many medicines\u2019 was \nof borderline significance (p=0.05).  The difference between scores for \u2018Natural remedies are \nsafer than medicines\u2019 was strongly statistically significant (p=0.001); there was a tendency to \nagree less with this item in 2005 compared to 2002.  \n \n 10 \nComparison of results for both surveys indicated that the self-reported health of 20.5% \nrespondents had deteriorated, 24.0% had improved and 55.5% had remained the same. Data \nwas available to compare General-overuse scores for 313 respondents and General-harm \nscores for 312 respondents. The remainder could not be allocated to one of the three groups \nbecause of missing data on self-reported health in at least one survey. \n \nANOVA revealed no \nstatistically significant differences in mean changes of either General-overuse scores or \nGeneral-harm scores over time between the health status groups. However, at the group level, \nthe 'Better' group did show a small but significant decrease in General-overuse score (Table \n4).  \n4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n4.1 Discussion  \nOur findings support the study hypothesis that general beliefs about medicines remain stable \nover time. No statistically significant differences in the BMQ-General scores of respondents \nwere observed after an intervening period of almost four years. In addition, when assessed \nseparately, there were no statistically significant differences over time for six of the eight \nBMQ-General items, with one of the other items having only borderline statistical \nsignificance. Further support for the study hypothesis was the observation that, irrespective of \nchanges in self-reported health status, general beliefs about medicines did not differ \nsignificantly over time. At the group level, General-overuse scores for those whose self-\nreported health improved over time showed a slight decrease suggesting a more positive \nattitude towards medicines. The clinical significance of this decrease is uncertain but warrants \nfurther investigation in future studies. The observed stability in general beliefs about \nmedicines is consistent with the conclusions reported in a previous study, that health beliefs, \nincluding some related to use of medicines, are stable from an early age(16). \n 11 \n \nOptimising the way in which people take medicines is important if the benefits are to be \nmaximised and adverse effects minimised. There is a substantial literature describing \ninterventions that have aimed to improve adherence, but few have proved effective. For \nexample, a recent Cochrane review identified 78 trials that tested 93 interventions to change \nadherence to prescribed medication(19).  The authors concluded that even the most effective \ninterventions were of limited value in improving adherence.  \n \nA number of published studies covering a variety of clinical areas report that adherence to \nmedication regimes is associated with beliefs about medicines (1, 20-24)\n \n. If, as their findings \nsuggest, low adherence is associated with negative beliefs about medicines, one approach to \nimproving adherence would be to apply an intervention that could modify those beliefs. A \npossible explanation for the lack of successful interventions noted in the Haynes et al \nCochrane review could be the failure of those interventions to modify patients\u2019 knowledge of, \nand beliefs about, their illnesses and treatments. This could be because beliefs about \nmedicines are particularly stable and resistant to change, or because inappropriate methods \nwere used to try to modify those beliefs.  \nIn this study we observed that general beliefs about medicines remained stable over time. \nAccording to the Common Sense Self-Regulatory Model, we might expect that, in the face \nof a change in health status, people's beliefs about the health threat together with their coping \nbehaviours (for example, adherence to medication) would be reappraised(25). Their attitudes \nto medicines would therefore be expected to change in the light of this experience. For \nexample, use of a successful drug therapy (leading to improved health status) might be \nexpected to engender more positive beliefs about medicines than an unsuccessful one. The \n 12 \nstability of BMQ-General scores over time observed in this study, even in the face of \nchanging self-reported health status, suggests that such reappraisal of general beliefs about \nmedicines may not occur. However, we do not know if this means that all beliefs about \nmedicines are resistant to change. It is possible that beliefs about specific medicines might \nchange according to experience while general beliefs remain stable, but our research did not \nmeasure those specific beliefs. Further work will be necessary to explore this in more depth.  \n \nAn alternative explanation for the scarcity of effective adherence interventions might be the \nfailure of investigators to apply appropriate techniques to target and change beliefs about \nmedicines. Interventions have been developed that can modify other psychological constructs \nsuch as attitudes or intentions, leading to behaviour change and improved patient outcomes. \nTechniques used have included self-monitoring and feedback(26). Given the apparent link \nbetween beliefs about medicines and adherence, it would seem reasonable to develop \ninterventions that modify negative beliefs about treatment. None of the 93 interventions \nreviewed by Haynes et al in their Cochrane review appeared to specifically target beliefs \nabout medicines or use this as an outcome in their evaluations. Other published trials may, \nhowever, provide some evidence that changing beliefs can improve adherence. For example, \none trial, excluded from the Cochrane review because it did not measure any treatment \noutcomes, described a theory-based intervention involving provision of telephone advice by a \npharmacist to 255 patients with a variety of chronic conditions(27). Although a higher than \nexpected level of drop-outs left this study underpowered, the findings suggested that \nintervention patients had more positive beliefs about their medicines and better adherence \nafter four weeks. Future \u2018adherence\u2019 interventions should be designed using a theory-based \napproach that identifies which techniques are most likely to modify beliefs about \n 13 \nmedicines(28). Interventions specifically designed in this way may have a greater chance of \nsuccess(29). \n \n  \nThe BMQ-General item that showed the greatest change over time in this study was \u2018Natural \nremedies are safer than medicines\u2019. Recent increases in the use of \u2018natural\u2019 remedies such as \nherbal and homeopathic preparations, and the high profile of such products in the media, \nmight suggest that attitudes towards allopathic medicines are more negative now than in the \npast. However, the reverse was found to be the case in our study as indicated by the tendency \ntowards less agreement with this item in 2005 compared with 2002. It could be that warnings \nfrom the scientific community about potential adverse effects of natural remedies, or their \ninteraction with prescription drugs, influenced the perceptions of the public during this \ntime(30). Further investigation is necessary to explain this finding. \n \nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that the BMQ has been administered twice to the same \nrespondents after a period of several years. Our participants were self-selected because they \n4.2 Study strengths and limitations \nwere volunteers who agreed to take part in further research when responding to our first \nquestionnaire. This could have introduced response bias. In addition, there were \nproportionately fewer younger people, smokers and drinkers of alcohol in our study than in \nthe Scottish population in general. However, the differences were fairly small and the \nrelatively large sample spanned a broad range of other personal characteristics and health \nstatus, increasing the generalisability of our results. Although some changes were made to the \nwording of the instructions to participants completing the BMQ to suit our original study \naims, these were very minor and are not expected to have affected the way in which the \nquestions were answered.  We do not know whether people\u2019s specific beliefs about prescribed \n 14 \nmedicines, as measured by the BMQ-Specific scale of the questionnaire, are also stable over \ntime. A study measuring BMQ-Specific scores at two time points would be needed to \ninvestigate this. \n \n4.2 Conclusion  \nWe have found that general beliefs about medicines appear to remain stable over time, \nirrespective of changes in health status. We do not know, however, if beliefs about medicines \nprescribed for specific conditions will be similarly stable, whether interventions specifically \ndesigned to influence beliefs about medicines can modify those beliefs and\/or adherence, or \nwhether such modifications would result in beneficial outcomes. Further research is needed to \naddress these issues.  \n \n4.3. Practice Implications \nFor the reasons discussed above, the observed stability in beliefs about medicines could have \nimplications for interventions to improve adherence to prescribed medication regimes. Given \nthe association between beliefs about medicines and adherence to medication regimes, it may \nbe helpful for practitioners to assess these types of beliefs in patients for whom they prescribe \nmedication. Such assessment would provide the opportunity to discuss patients\u2019 beliefs with \nthem. However, practitioners should avoid the assumption that such discussions, or changes \nin patients\u2019 health status, will alter their beliefs. This study presents evidence to suggest that \nthese beliefs may not be easily changed. Furthermore, at present there appears to be no RCT-\nlevel evidence that coaching interventions or other attempts at persuasion would modify \nbeliefs about medicines, as none of the trials in the Cochrane review(19) evaluated the effect \nof interventions on this variable. \n \n  \n 15 \nDECLARATION \nI confirm all patient\/personal identifiers have been removed or disguised so the \npatient\/person(s) described are not identifiable and cannot be identified through the details of \nthe story. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
