INTRODUCTION \n \nDuring a major storm surge in 1953 seven people drowned \nwhen the sea overtopped the dunes at Sea Palling in East \nAnglia as a result of a high spring tide of approximately \n3.5m coinciding with an estimated storm surge of 3.2m. \nFollowing that event, a sea wall was built to protect the \nvillage from further risk, but in recent years those sea \ndefences began to be undercut by the sea, and a series of \nnine shore-parallel breakwaters (Figure 1.) were installed in \nconjunction with beach recharge in an attempt to protect the \nearlier defences. \nThese new breakwaters were designed to better retain \nthe sand and hence continue the protection to that part of the \ncoast, but the first four breakwaters performed better than \nexpected at this site and the first breakwater on the northern \nupdrift end of the structures now has a permanent tombolo \nlinking the breakwater to the shore \u2013 something that was \nnever intended in the original design. The subsequent set of \nfive breakwaters installed during the second phase of \nconstruction were built to a slightly smaller size, spacing \nand with a lower height and have performed closer to their \ndesign specification.  \nDespite these efforts to protect the shoreline, beach \nrecharge operations have been necessary every few years to \nmaintain the beach at this vulnerable section of the coast. \nIn 2005 The UK Engineering and Physical Sciences \nResearch Council (EPSRC) and Natural Environment \nResearch Council (NERC) funded LEACOAST2, a \ncollaborative research project to study the hydrodynamics \nand sediment processes around these breakwaters that \nfollowed on from the earlier LEACOAST project [1]. The \naim was to improve the understanding of how such \nstructures interact with the hydrodynamic and sedimentary \nenvironment and hence improve future design guidelines, as \nwell as provide a field scale dataset for sediment process \nmodel development and validation. \n \n \n2.  MEASUREMENTS \n \nTeams from the Universities of East Anglia, Plymouth and \nLiverpool and from the Proudman Oceanographic \nLaboratory (POL) (now the National Oceanography Centre, \nLiverpool) began work in 2006 with a wide range of \nequipment for monitoring waves, currents and sediment \ndynamics.  \nFor the purpose of long term monitoring, an ARGUS \nvideo system was installed on a tower to study the nearshore \nand beach processes and an X-band marine radar on the roof \nof the local lifeboat station for looking over longer ranges of \nup to 4km. Surveys of the beaches and embayments were \nconducted at regular intervals both on foot and by boat \nusing an RTK GPS system by the University of East Anglia \nteam.  \nIntensive field measurement campaigns were conducted \nduring March - April 2006 and October 2006 \u2013 January \n2007 using a variety of in-situ frames and measurement \nsystems for studying the hydro and sediment dynamics. \n \nFigure 1. Location map and view of the Sea Palling breakwaters looking north from the slipway. The first phase of \nfour breakwaters are clearly visible together with the tombolo linking to the nearest at low water. The radar was \nlocated a few metres from this position up on the flat roof of a lifeboat station. \n A Kelvin Hughes marine X-band (9.8GHz) radar with \na 2.4m rotating antenna was deployed on the roof of the Sea \nPalling Inshore Lifeboat Station about 5m above beach level \nand overlooking the offshore breakwaters and associated \nembayments. This was coupled to a PC based digitisation \nsystem of in-house design, allowing image sequences of the \nsea surface to be recorded automatically every hour to \nranges of 4km. Each individual radar record comprised a \nsequence of 256 images, each frame of which represents \none 2.8 second rotation of the radar antenna, hence each \nimage sequence spanned a period of around 12 minutes.  \nThe radar signal was digitised at 20MHz, giving radial \nsamples at 7.5m intervals, and the ping rate was of the order \nof 3kHz. The antenna beam pattern was approximately 0.8 \ndegrees in the horizontal, leading to the sample footprint at \na distance of 1km from the radar being an arc with a radial \ndimension of 7.5m and a circumferential dimension of \naround 20m, going up to 80m at a range of 4km.  \nThe practical consequence of this is that the tangential \nresolution of the radar images degrades with range, \nprecluding the ability to image shorter wavelength waves at \nlonger ranges. However, the radial resolution does not \ndegrade substantially with range, and at other sites it has \nbeen possible to resolve wave patterns and hence perform \nbathymetric inversions to a range of 7.5km when looking \ninto the direction of incoming waves. \nSummary images of each record were produced and \nsent via a broadband link to the POL website so that the \nstatus of the system could be monitored via the internet, \nincluding radar snapshots of the sea surface and time-lapse \nimages that show persistent sea surface roughness features \nvery well. Waves tend to be visible on the radar images only \nwhen the wave height is larger than about 1m, so in contrast \nto more conventional surveying techniques this method of \nmapping is only appropriate during wave events. However, \nthis would allow the bathymetry of an area to be monitored \nduring storms when the largest changes might be expected. \n \nWaves, tides and currents were monitored at various \nlocations around the system of breakwaters and \nembayments using variety of in-situ instrument frames \nalthough none were located more than 500m offshore. Of \nparticular interest is the upward looking Acoustic Doppler \nCurrent Profiler (ADCP) record from a frame located just \nseaward of the northernmost breakwater, as it was located in \nan area sufficiently clear of the breakwaters to allow clear \ntidal signals to be observed.  During this time there was a \nsignificant storm and surge event during which all deployed \ncurrent meters showed that the usual tidal reversal was \noverpowered by the storm induced currents such that the \nebb tidal current continued to flow to the south east rather \nthan reverse to flow north west as would be more usual. \nThe majority of these instrument frames included \npressure sensors, but none were in place for the full duration \nof the radar deployment, so a continuous unbroken water \nlevel record could not be constructed easily. Instead, \nadvantage was taken of the UK National Tide Gauge \nNetwork which operates a network of 44 tide gauges around \nthe UK, the nearest of which being Cromer, 20km to the \nnorth of Sea Palling and Lowestoft 35km to the south. Tidal \nresiduals from these gauges were combined with tide \npredictions for Sea Palling itself to provide a continuous \nestimate of water level at the Sea Palling site for the full 2 \nyear radar deployment. This estimated water level record \ncompared favourably with the shorter records from in-situ \npressure sensors and provided a consistent water level \nreference for the full period of the radar deployment, \nallowing radar derived water depths to be related to a fixed \ndatum. \n3.  ANALYSIS \n \nThe extensive nature of the radar dataset and reliance \non waves being present at any particular time for the data to \nbe of use for bathymetry mapping has meant that attention \nhas been focussed on specific hydrodynamic events.  \n \n \nFigure 2. A snapshot of the sea surface recorded using \nthe radar at Sea Palling during a wave event. Wave \nrefraction into the shallow embayments between the \nbreakwaters can clearly be seen. \nIn particular a storm and surge event at the end of \nOctober 2006 occurred during one of the intensive \nmeasurement campaigns when all of the in-situ frames were \ndeployed, and on which the project partners have focussed \nthe majority of analysis and modelling efforts. \nThe principle underlying the wave inversion analysis \nused here is that the behaviour of waves at a local scale is \ngoverned by the water depth and current. Therefore if the \nfrequency -wavenumber spectrum, can be mapped from an \nimaging system such as the radar (or video) then it should \nbe possible to infer the depth and current maps that caused \nthe observed wave behaviour. \nThe wave dispersion relation used in this case \napproximates non-linear wave theory [2] [3] using a wave \nheight correction to linear wave theory and has been \nmodified to include the Doppler shift of the waves due to a \nmean current.  \nRadar data representing an area of 3km x 2km centred \non the breakwater system was selected for detailed analysis. \nA snapshot of the raw radar data from this analysis area is \nshown in Figure 2 with brighter shading indicating stronger \nradar backscatter. These data were processed for bathymetry \nand currents using a data window of 120m square and at \nspatial intervals of 30m [4][5][6]. Initially, four tidal cycles \nof hourly radar records were processed for bathymetry and \ncurrents.  \n \n4.  RESULTS - BATHYMETRY \n \nAn example of a bathymetric map derived using the radar \nsystem is shown in Figure 3. Water depths are relative to \nOrdinance Datum Newlyn (ODN) - the datum used by the \nUK Ordinance Survey Organisation, which is approximately \n0.25m below mean sea level at Sea Palling. \nFigure 3. A radar derived bathymetric map corrected to \nOrdinance Datum Newlyn  (ODN) using a mean tidal \nlevel. The embayments are clearly defined and a set of \nsubtidal dunes outside the breakwaters are evident. \nTransects from this radar derived bathymetric map were \ncompared with the echo sounder survey that was conducted \nby the University of East Anglia team in calm conditions \nshortly after  the wave event.  \nThese survey lines together with the corresponding \nradar derived bathymetry transects are shown in Figure 4. \nThe plots illustrate that while there are differences between \nthe survey and the radar derived depths, generally of less \nthan a metre, the variations in the individual records \ncorresponding to the subtidal dunes are clearly \ndistinguished. The variations in the radar derived transect \nappear to follow a smoothed version of those in the survey \nas might be expected from this type of analysis. \nFigure 4. A comparison of longshore bathymetry \ntransects derived from the radar (Blue dotted line) and \nsurvey data (Red solid line) \n \nThis presents the possibility of tracking the migration \nof such dune features over extended periods of time, and \nearly results indicate that the features maintain coherence \nand can be seen to migrate in the positive \u2018x\u2019 direction. This \ncorresponds to a long shore migration to the south east as \nexpected from the prevailing long shore drift and residual \ncurrents for that area. This net migration of dune features in \nwater depths of 6-10m represents a significant transport \npathway for sediment on that part of the coast, and one that \nhas previously not been accounted for. \nFurther work will aim to derive the flux of sediment \ncontained within these migrating dune features, allowing \ntheir relative importance to the sediment budget to be \nassessed compared with more conventional estimates of \nlong shore drift in the intertidal zone. \n \n5.  RESULTS - CURRENTS \n \nCurrent measurements derived from the radar compared \nfavorably with depth mean currents measured using an \nAcoustic Doppler Current Profiler located close to the \nnorthernmost breakwater. A comparison of the long shore \ncomponent of the depth mean ADCP record with the \ncorresponding radar derived long shore current is shown in \nFigure 5. These data show that during the peak of the wave \nevent in the first half of the plot, the wave driven near shore \ncurrents overwhelmed the normal tidal reversal. Then as the \nstorm subsided the normal tidal reversal returned in the \nlatter half of the plot. There is a consistent residual flow to \nthe south east (a negative bias on the plot) for the whole \nperiod, probably driven by the waves approaching from the \nnorth. \nA second radar derived time series of currents is shown \nin Figure 6 together with the same ADCP record. This radar \nderived time series is taken from a point 1km offshore and \ndirectly seawards of the radar position. The data shows that \nat that position the tidal currents were able to reverse even \nat the height of the storm and there is far less evidence of a \nresidual flow to the south east. This suggests that the wave \ndriven \u2018jet\u2019 was confined close to the shore. \n \nFigure 5. Comparison of depth mean long shore \ncurrents measured by an ADCP close to the \nnorthernmost breakwater (black) compared with radar \nderived longshore currents at the same location (red). \nThe radar derived currents in Figure 6 also hint at a \nslight phase shift compared with those at the ADCP position \nat the northernmost breakwater, which would be consistent \nwith the propagation direction of the tide. This suggests that \nit might be possible to derive maps of the tidal phase at high \nresolution from such data, and this will also be investigated \nin further work. \n \n6.
