Introduction\nThe erosion of both electron beam physical vapour deposited (EB PVD) and plasma sprayed (PS)\nthermal barrier coatings (TBCs) has been well documented in the past 1-3 4 and will not be covered\nhere5. However, more recently the effects of aging on the erosion resistance and mechanical\nproperties have also been studied 6-8. Interestingly, where Janos et al 8 found that the aging increased\nthe hardness and the erosion resistance of PS TBCs, due to improvements in the inter-splat bonding,\nWellman and Nicholls 7 found that aging increased the erosion rate for EB PVD TBCs. 100hrs at\n1100\u00b0C was found to double the erosion rate while 24hrs at 1500\u00b0C quadrupled it. The different\nresponse to sintering by the two different types of coating is directly related to the differences in\nerosion mechanism which results from the different structure of the coatings. In plasma sprayed\ncoatings erosion rate is dependent on the strength of the inter-splat bonding and thus any strengthening\nof the bonds will improve the erosion resistance. While in EB PVD TBCs the increases in erosion rate\nwhere attributed to both changes in the porosity of the coatings and to the sintering together of the\nindividual columns EB PVD TBCs are only about 80% dense. The sintering of the columns together\nresulted in the propagation of lateral cracks across neighbouring columns thus resulting in a greater\nmass loss per impact event. This adequately explains the increase in erosion rate at 1500\u00b0C where\nsignificant evidence of sintering was observed. However, since at 1100\u00b0C sintering was not as marked\nit was thought that there was something else affecting the erosion rate, possibly porosity and hardness.\nThese finding prompted the authors to investigate the effects of aging on the hardness of the coatings.\nHowever, in previous work 6 it was noted that there was a difference in the hardness between\nindividual columns of an EB PVD TBC, 12-14GPa in the as received condition, and the coating as a\nwhole, 2-3GPa. Thus it was necessary to use nano indentation techniques to assess the changes in the\nhardness of the columns of the EB PVD TBCs and micro hardness tests to determine the hardness of\nthe coating as a whole. Since erosion contact areas are of a similar size to the area of the columns it is\nthe columnar properties that are important and not the properties of the coating as a whole. Thus the\nmain aim of this project was to determine the effect of aging on the measured hardness of both the\nindividual columns and the coating as a whole for EB PVD TBCs.\n32. Samples and Test Method\nAn 8wt% Y2O3 partially stabilised ZrO2 was deposited, using EB PVD techniques, onto a number of\ndifferent substrates which were then given two different heat treatments, namely 100hrs at 1100\u00b0C and\n24hrs at 1500\u00b0C. The samples, including untreated ones, were then cut for the various aspects of the\ninvestigation. Cross sectioned samples were prepared for analysis and sections were prepared for\nnano and micro indentation. Due to the roughness of the coatings in the as deposited condition it was\nnecessary to polish the samples in order to conduct the nano indentation studies. All the indentation\ntests were conducted on at Cranfield University using a Micro Materials NanoTestTM 600, which uses\na diamond Berkovich head. The Oliver and Pharr method was used to determine the hardness and\nYoungs Modulus of the coatings.\nThe following test conditions were used for the indentation studies.\nDue to the size of the columns (10-17\u00b5m in diameter) nano indents, which are about 3-5\u00b5m in size,\nwill be affected by edge effects and neighbouring columns unless positioned close to the centre of the\ncolumn. Thus it was decided to do a number of indents, 49, and use statistical methods to de-\nconvolute the results. Thus the nano indents where conducted on a 7 by 7 grid. A 10mN load was\nused for the microhardness tests, as this resulted in indents that could be contained within an\nindividual column. In the case of micro indentation, since the indent size was expected to interact\nwith a number of columns a 2N load was used and only 4 indents were done on each sample. Previous\nwork on TBCs in the as received condition showed that at loads greater than 1-1.5N the coating\nhardness was assessed. Since the coatings were all in the region of 150\u00b5m thick (after preparation) it\nwas assumed that the substrate had absolutely no effect on the measurements.\n43. Results\n3.1 Effects of Aging Treatments on Microstructure\nThe micrographs in Figures 1-3 show the effect of aging on the morphology of the coatings. Figure 1\nis a reference sample and illustrates a typical EB PVD TBC with its pyramidal type tops to the\ncolumns. It was due to this morphology that it was necessary to polish the samples before indentation\ntesting could be done. As can be seen from Figure 2 there is no visible change to the column\nmorphology after only 100hrs at 1100\u00b0C. However, after 24hrs at 1500\u00b0C, as can be seen from Figure\n3 there has been significant sintering of the columns, which have lost their pyramidal morphology and\nhave started to sinter together. Further, as can be seen in Figure 3b, mud flat cracking has started to\ndevelop as a result of the sintering.\n3.2 Micro Indentation\nThe results of the micro indentation studies are given in the graphs in Figure 4 and 5. These results\nshowed that the hardness of the coating increased with aging condition for both the substrates tested.\nThe low hardness measured on the samples aged at 1500\u00b0C are a result of the measurement being\ntaken on a porous section of the coating. This will be discussed further in a following section.\n3.3 Nano Indentation\nThe graphs in Figure 6 and 7 are the results of the nano indentation tests performed on the coatings on\nthe zirconia and the alumina substrates, plotting hardness against probability.\nAs can be seen from the results the hardness of the coatings was found to increase with an increase in\naging condition except for the coating deposited on zirconia and aged at 1500\u00b0C. This anomaly will\nbe explained in the Discussion.\n54. Discussion\nThe micro indentation tests revealed that the hardness of the EB PVD TBC increased as a function of\naging on both of the substrates, to similar levels, although the coating on the alumina substrate had a\nlower measured hardness in the as received condition. This was attributed to the fact that there was a\ngreater degree of mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficient of the alumina and the coating\nthan between the zirconia and the coating. Thus on cooling after deposition of the TBC (which occurs\nat 1000\u00b0C) there is less constraint between the individual columns on the alumina substrate and hence\na lower measured hardness. The scatter in the results observed in the graph in Figure 5 was a result of\nsome of the indents being positioned over cracked regions of the coating that was aged at 1500\u00b0C, as\nillustrated in Figure 8, consequently these results, the three lowest, can be disregarded. This was a\nresult of sintering occurring in the samples aged at 1500\u00b0C for 24hrs and, in the case of the zirconia\nsubstrate, the formation of mud flat cracking.\nPrevious work on the micro indentation of EB PVD TBCs has shown that the load at which the tests\nare conducted is extremely important as can be seen form the graph in Figure 9. This graph shows the\nexistence of a transition between measuring the properties of an individual column at low loads and\nthe properties of the coating at high loads where the indented area interact with a number of different\ncolumns, hence a load of 2N was used for the micro indentation tests to ensure that the tests were\nconducted at loads greater than the transition loads.\nAs mentioned earlier it was decided to use a load of 10mN for the nano indentation tests and due to the\nfact that a statistical variation of the results was expected 49 indents were conducted on each of the\ntest samples, this was in order to obtain a probability plot. It was hoped that the shape of the plot\nwould be similar to that obtained for the nano indentation of bulk zirconia (from previous work 6) as\nshown in Figure 10, i.e. the results would plateau indicating results un-affected by defect. Such a plot\nenables one to determine those results influenced by porosity or defects and the un-affected results.\nHowever, due to the columnar morphology of the EB PVD TBCs and the size of the columns, 10-\n17\u00b5m diameter, most of the nano indentation tests, which were performed on the tops of the columns,\n6were influenced to some degree by either column boundaries or defects, resulting in the plots shown in\nFigure 6 and Figure 7. Thus, the hardness of the column was taken as the highest measured reading\nand it was assumed that all the other indents had been affected by interactions with defects and column\nboundaries. It was assumed that the highest result was the most probable correct reading of hardness.\nIdeally the results would have plateaued but this was unfortunately not the case.\nUnfortunately due to the size of the indents and the low penetration depth it was not possible to find\nand photograph the indented areas and thus was not possible to ascertain the degree to which the\nindents interacted with the individual columns.\nThese changes in the hardness of the coating with aging are attributed to a number of different\nmechanisms which include: changes in the micro porosity of the columns, changes in the porosity of\nthe coating as a whole due to sintering together of columns, indentation size effects and phase\ntransformation at the higher aging temperature.\nIn all cases the measured increase in the hardness of the samples aged at 1100\u00b0C was attributed to\nchanges in the morphology of the individual columns rather than changes to the coating as a whole.\nFor the samples aged at 1500\u00b0C the change in the hardness was attributed to a combination of the\nchanges in the micro porosity within the columns the sintering together of the columns(although this\nwould have a minor effect) and to phase transformations. The coating on the zirconia substrate,\nhowever, showed a decrease in the measured hardness; it is thought that this is not a true refection of\nthe hardness of the columns but rather indicated that none of the indents centred on a column and\nhence all the measured results are low. The authors do not believe that these results represent the true\nhardness of the columns but rather that it is an effect as a result of the sintering and subsequent cooling\nof the sample and the resultant sinter cracks.\nThe hardness measured on the coating deposited onto the zirconia substrate and aged at 1500\u00b0C also\nneeds to be discussed as it is significantly higher than expected. It was expected that the hardness of\n7the columns would increase as a result of the aging process but not to such an extent. It is felt that\nthere is an over estimation of the hardness due to \u2018indentation size effect\u2019. Bull 9 noted that a higher\nmeasured hardness would obtained when the material being tested did not reach full elastic-plastic\nbehaviour during indentation, as a result of the tip of the indenter being blunt. The authors propose\nthat this could also occur when testing hard materials (i.e. ceramics) at very low loads (possibly\n10mN) thus resulting in an over estimation of the hardness measured. However, since the hardness of\nthe aged samples are being compared to the results from as received samples, under identical testing\nconditions, one can still conclude that the 1500\u00b0C aging treatment resulted in a significant increase in\nthe hardness of the columns.\nSince this project was initiated to investigate the cause for the increase in the erosion rate of aged\nsamples this should also be discussed. Since TBCs are ceramics and erode via a brittle mechanism it\nis expected that the erosion rate will be affected by changes in both hardness and fracture toughness of\nthe ceramics. Since fracture toughness of the individual columns could not be measured it was\ndecided to see how hardness changed with aging condition. This paper has clearly indicated that the\nhardness of the coating increases as a function of aging condition. Since TBCs are ceramic and brittle\nby nature it is reasonable to assume that as the hardness increases the coating will become more brittle,\ni.e. the fracture toughness of the coating and individual columns will decrease. Since a decrease in\nfracture toughness will result in an increase in erosion rate, the increase in hardness due to aging\nwould account for part of the increase in the erosion rate of aged samples. As mentioned earlier, part\nof the increase in erosion rate of the samples aged at 1500\u00b0C is as a result of the sintering together of\nthe columns enabling crack propagation across the columns, which prior to sintering would not occur,\nthus resulting in an increase in erosion rate.\nThe results of the micro hardness test conclusively show that the hardness of the coating as a whole\nincreases with an increase in the aging conditions. The nano indentation results also show an increase\nin hardness with aging although more work is needed to be able to fully quantify the increase in\nhardness of the coatings with aging.\n85. Conclusion\n\uf0b7 It was found that the aging increased the hardness of both the coating as a whole and the\nindividual columns of the coatings.\n\uf0b7 The micro hardness of the coating was found to increase from 2.5-3.5 GPa in the as received\ncondition to 4.5-6 GPa after 100hrs at 1100\u00b0C and to 7.5-8 GPa after 24hrs at 1500\u00b0C.\n\uf0b7 The nano hardness of the individual columns on the other hand was found to increase from\n18GPa in the as received condition to 35 GPa after aging.\n\uf0b7 The observed increase in the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs with aging condition can be partly\nattributed to the measured increase in hardness with aging conditions and the assumed\ndecrease in fracture toughness.\n6.
