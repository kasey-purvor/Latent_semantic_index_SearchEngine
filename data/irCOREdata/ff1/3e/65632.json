The findings suggest significant potential for rapid progress to be made\nin developing both evidence based policy, and policy relevant evidence to tackle inequalities in health.\nI\nn the first paper in this series,1 policymakers involved\nin public health decision making debated what type of\nevidence had an impact on public health policy on\ninequalities, and how the availability of this evidence could\nbe improved. This exercise revealed some powerful messages\nfor the research community, in particular that while clarity,\ntimeliness, relevance, and costs were of prime importance\nwhen judging the relevance and utility of research evidence,\nthese features were often absent from current research. There\nwas also a concern that much \u2018\u2018policy relevant evidence\u2019\u2019 was\nbeing ignored, even though this \u2018\u2018wider public health evi-\ndence\u2019\u2019 often sets the context within which determinants of\nhealth inequalities may be created. One important recom-\nmendation was that researchers could help policymakers\nmore with the task of piecing together the jigsaw of evidence;\nanother important observation was that there was a need to\nincrease the \u2018\u2018flow\u2019\u2019 of evidence on reducing health inequal-\nities\u2014in particular, there was a perceived need for evalua-\ntions of the differential impacts of policies on different\nsocioeconomic groups.\nIn this second paper we explore researchers\u2019 perspectives\non these questions, as well as their perceptions of what type\nof evidence has an impact, and of the means of improving the\navailability of such evidence. The overarching focus is on\nthe evidence base for public health policy making, which in the\nUK (as elsewhere) aims to improve population health while\nalso seeking to reduce health inequalities. To address this issue\nfrom the researcher\u2019s perspective we organised a second\nfocused workshop, this time with senior research leaders.\nThis paper presents examples of policy relevant evidence put\nforward during focused discussions, and analyses the nature\nand sources of such evidence. It then uses these discussions to\ndraw out pointers for the more effective garnering of policy\nrelevant evidence for tackling health inequalities.\nMETHODS\nThe authors, as members of the ESRC Centre for Evidence-\nbased Public Health Policy,2 organised a two day residential\nworkshop at a conference centre in Sussex, England, in\nOctober 2002. Eight senior researchers from the UK and one\nfrom overseas were selected purposively to have the following\ncharacteristics: over 10 years\u2019 experience of synthesising or\nevaluating the evidence on major policies related to health\ninequalities; current leaders in their field as indicated by\nrelevant research awards for which they were principal\ninvestigators, publications and supervision of teams of\nresearchers under these grants; expert advisors to national\nand international policymaking on the implications of\nresearch for policy. As comparatively few people currently\nwork in this field and have the above characteristics, most\nparticipants were known to each other and knew one or more\nof the authors. Participants were assured that their remarks\nwould not be attributed and would be kept confidential. Four\nfocused sessions over the two days were facilitated by the\nauthors in turn, whose role was strictly neutral in that they\nintroduced the focused questions and chaired the sessions,\nbut refrained from voicing their own opinions. Participants\nwere asked to concentrate on a series of questions and the\nensuing dialogue was transcribed independently by two\nrapporteurs (CB, ME). The participants were first asked\nto give illuminating examples of research evidence that\nhad influenced public health related policy around health\ninequalities. Secondly, they were asked about the nature and\nlocation of the evidence and what constitutes good evidence\nmore generally in relation to initiatives to reduce health\ninequalities. The rapporteurs compared notes to produce a\nsingle agreed transcript. MP, MMW, CB, and ME coded the\ntranscript, with input from the other authors, and from this\nidentified the main themes. These were discussed with all the\n817\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nauthors to achieve agreement. We then analysed this\ntranscript for emerging pointers toward the means of\nassembling policy relevant evidence for tackling health\ninequalities in the future.\nRESULTS\nWhat type of evidence has an impact on policy?\nResearch leaders were asked to give examples from their own\nexperience of research that had had an impact on public\nhealth policy related to health inequalities. Their replies\nillustrated that such research has a diversity of purposes and\nsources, grouped into five main categories (box 1).\n(1) Observational studies identifying a problem\nPerhaps the simplest example of evidence leading to policy\naction concerned research that identified the existence of a\nproblem, and for which the intervention to tackle the issue\nwas then fairly obvious. One example given was the obser-\nvational studies showing the association between environ-\nmental radon and lung cancer. This evidence highlighted the\nproblem,3 and led to housing interventions to protect people\nliving in high radon localities.4 For example, in certain high\nrisk areas in the UK, such as Cornwall, grants were given for\nhousing ventilation to reduce the risk of radon associated\ndisease.5\u20137 Another classic example cited was the epidemio-\nlogical studies showing the health damaging effects of\ntobacco exposure, which stimulated a raft of tobacco con-\ntrol policies around the world. These have reduced tobacco\nconsumption to varying degrees, and the focus is now on\ndetermining which combination of interventions would be\nmost effective in specified contexts.\nThe participants recognised that these examples involved\nsingle risks, so the evidence was easier to establish and the\ninterventions themselves were simpler. The task was felt to\nbe much more difficult when addressing health inequalities,\nwhich have multiple causes, rather than a single determinant\n(box 1).\n(2) Modest, but polit ically timely, household studies\nThe persuasiveness of evidence from studies of the reality\nof life in different kinds of households was highlighted.\nSometimes these were descriptive studies, reporting house-\nhold budgets and analysing expenditure on the prerequisites\nfor health for families living in different socioeconomic\ncircumstances. Qualitative studies of decision making in\nfamilies\u2014exploring why one course of action was chosen\nover another\u2014have also had powerful policy impacts. Two\nexamples from the first term of the Labour government were\nused as illustration.\nOne study of the costs of raising children showed that in\nthe 1990s parental expenditure on the essentials for young\nchildren was as high as for older ones, but the official\nbenefits for younger children were much lower.8 The findings\nof this study were disseminated at the same time as the\ndecisions on the 1998 budget were being made and appeared\nto have an immediate impact upon it, with an increase\nin benefit rates for the under 11 year olds.9 The research\nevidence was actually cited by ministers in support of the\ndecision.10 11 The speed of reaction, however, may indicate\na prior decision, with the research evidence used as extra\nammunition. This research is still having an impact on social\nsecurity policy as in the new Child Tax Credit (effective from\nApril 2003) all children over 1 year old attract the same rate\nof allowance.12\nThe second example cited was a qualitative study of\nincome distribution within households in receipt of bene-\nfits.13 This study showed significant gender inequalities in the\ncontrol and distribution of household income. Women\nwere more likely than men to have the burden of financial\nmanagement in low income families, and to \u2018\u2018go without\u2019\u2019 to\nmeet their children\u2019s needs, whereas men had greater finan-\ncial control of overall income and were much more likely\nthan women to indulge in high levels of personal spending.\nThe study\u2019s findings implied that the government\u2019s 1998\nplans to replace Family Credit (paid to the mother) with the\nWorking Families Tax Credit (paid through the wage packet\nto the main earner) might change the perception and allo-\ncation of the money. It was a modest study (31 subjects), but\nits timing was crucial, as it influenced the final legislation\nthat permitted couples to chose whether the benefit would be\npaid as a tax credit via the wage packet or as a cash benefit.14\nAgain, this research has had a continued impact on social\nsecurity policy, as the new Child Tax Credit will be paid to the\nmain carer of the child.\n(3) Controlled evaluations of interventions\nSeveral examples of experimental evidence influencing non-\nhealthcare policy were given, although it was emphasised\nthat controlled evaluations were still the exception rather\nthan the rule. One experimental study, funded by the US\nDepartment of Labor in 1971, was started in response to a\nlong running debate about whether extending unemploy-\nment benefit to recently released prisoners would reduce re-\noffending rates.15 Some 432 prisoners who were about to be\nreleased from prisons in Maryland were randomly assigned\nto one of three treatment groups (payments only, counselling\nonly, both combined) and a control group. The results of the\nstudy showed that the likelihood of re-offending was lower\nin the payment intervention group than in the controls, and\nthis finding was supported by later studies.16 Policy changes\nBox 1 What type of evidence has an impact on\npolicy to tackle health inequalities? Researchers\u2019\nviews\n(1) Observational studies that identified a problem\n\u2018\u2018Evidence based policy\u2019s successes are where the interven-\ntion is quite easy once the problem has been correctly\nidentified.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018Bringing up a problem with an easy solution will have\nmore impact. It is trickier when there is an identifiable\nproblem and the solutions are not clear or they are\ncomplex\u2014health inequalities. What to do about this is\ndifficult\u2019\u2019.\n(2) Modest, but politically timely, household studies\n\u2018\u2018The power of qualitative evidence is high. Qualitative\nevidence paired with quantitative is much more persuasive.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018Timing is crucial. A small piece of research can have an\nimpact if timed rightly\u2019\u2019\n(3) Controlled evaluations of interventions\n\u2018\u2018In 1960s America, there was a more straightforward\nrelationship between research and evidence as policy-\nmakers seemed to be waiting for the results of certain trials\nbefore they made their policy decisions \u2026 this is now rare\u2019\u2019.\n(4) Natural policy experiments\n\u2018\u2018There are natural policy experiments going on that are\nimportant \u2026 but \u2026 (there are) limitations here to the kinds of\ncontrols\/comparisons that can be drawn. Hard to get\ncredible research designs in natural experiments\u2019\u2019.\n(5) Historical evidence with a long shelf life\n\u2018\u2018Policy-makers expect evidence to pop up when they want it.\nLots of things in the past e.g. Rowntree\u2019s studies still have\ninfluence on our social security system\u2014a limestone effect.\nResearch from a long time ago can find itself valuable\u2019\u2019.\n818 Whitehead, Petticrew, Graham, et al\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \ndirectly followed from this finding in some states; for\nexample, California extended unemployment benefit pay-\nments to released prisoners in 1978.15\nThe Headstart programme of pre-school education and\nchild care in the 1960s in the USA was also subject to\nrigorous evaluation. Early positive impacts on child develop-\nment in children experiencing the programme compared\nwith controls brought about a boost in funding for such\nprogrammes. When, however, the gains seemed to disappear\nafter four or five years, the funding wavered. It was not until\nthe children were in their teenage years that \u2018\u2018sleeper effects\u2019\u2019\nof the pre-school programme re-appeared, in terms of greater\nlikelihood of staying on at school, of getting a job and earning\nmore money, and of lower rates of teenage pregnancy and\narrests.17\u201320 These results have subsequently provided compel-\nling evidence for the setting up of the UK\u2019s \u2018\u2018SureStart\u2019\u2019\nprogramme of early education and care introduced in Britain\nin the late 1990s. The same effect of rigorous research on\nspecific issues can be observed in developing countries. In\nAfrica, for example, research on vitamin A and mortality,\nand on rehydration for diarrhoeal diseases have all had an\nimmediate impact on worldwide policy and practice after\nrecommendations from WHO.21 22\nContrasting examples\u2014of evidence that has prevented ill\nadvised policy\u2014were also presented, including the decision\nnot to proceed with mass screening for prostate screening in\nthe mid-1990s. Conservative ministers at the time were\nattracted to the idea, as it could be seen as doing something\nabout men\u2019s health. However, the reviews undertaken by the\nNHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination in York and\ninternationally23 concluded that there was insufficient\nevidence for proceeding and that in fact prostate screening\nmay be harmful. Initially, the evidence was ignored, but\nwhen the researchers became more active in disseminating\ntheir results through press conferences the policymakers did\nreverse their decision.\n(4) Natural policy experiments\nParticipants suggested that evidence from other countries or\nregions could inform debate if it provided concrete informa-\ntion on what happens when a particular policy currently\nunder consideration in one place has already been introduced\nelsewhere. Evidence from surveys of public attitudes to pro-\nposed changes could add to that debate. In 1993, for instance,\nthe New Zealand Blood Transfusion Service became part of a\nnew hospital reorganisation that was required to be profit\ndriven. The results of a survey on the motivations of blood\ndonors suggested that 52% of New Zealand\u2019s blood donors\nwould cease donating if profit were to be made from the\nblood.24 This would have a massive impact on the ability of\nthe service to match demand. As a result of the widespread\npublicity these findings received, the idea to make a profit\nfrom blood donations was scrapped.\n(5) Historical evidence with a long shelf l i fe\nSeveral researchers emphasised that evidence from the past,\neven from many decades ago, should not be overlooked, and\nin fact may be particularly influential in the public health\nfield. Much of the influence is unconscious, but none the less\npowerful in setting the policy agenda. Two examples were\ncited, one being the Rowntree Poverty Surveys of 1901 and\nonwards.25\u201327 These painted a vivid picture of life in the slums\nof Britain\u2019s industrial cities and were shocking to the general\npublic at the time. Their enduring legacy, however, has been\ntheir influence on public attitudes to poverty and the poor\nthroughout the 20th century, which underpinned the build-\ning of the postwar welfare system.28\nThere was also the \u2018\u2018sleeper effect\u2019\u2019 of evidence produced in\na \u2018\u2018cold climate\u2019\u2019, which at the time may seem to have little or\nno immediate impact, but was stored and used when a more\nfavourable political climate develops. One example related to\nsuicide and health inequalities. In Scotland observational\nevidence on the association between unemployment and\nparasuicide produced in the 1980s29 was greeted frostily by\nthe Scottish Office, and attempts were made to discredit it.\nDuring the late 1990s, however, the subject was revived when\nstudies showed that completed suicide rates among young\nmen in Scotland had increased for 30 years.30 A 1998\nconference on the topic received wide media coverage, and\nin 2000 an opposition initiated debate on suicide was held\nin the Scottish Assembly. This in turn kick started the\ndevelopment of a suicide prevention strategy.31 32\nHow can the availability of these types of evidence be\nimproved?\nThe participants then turned to the question of how the avail-\nability of these types of evidence could be improved (box 2).\n(1) Assembling \u2018\u2018the evidence jigsaw\u2019\u2019\nOne prominent theme running through the dialogue was the\ndiversity of sources of policy relevant evidence. The examples\ncited above came from classic observational studies, inter-\nvention research, natural policy experiments, and from\nquantitative and qualitative explorations of the real life\nimpacts of policies. This reflects participants\u2019 views of a\n\u2018\u2018jigsaw\u2019\u2019 of evidence, by which they meant the need to\nsynthesise evidence from diverse sources to make the causal\nlinks that would inform policy.\nMore often than not, the most valuable policy relevant\ninformation was not one single piece of evidence, but\nrather many different bits, of varying quality, creatively\npieced together. For example, participants pointed out that\nBox 2 How can the availabili ty of evidence on\nreducing health inequalities be improved?\n(1) Assemble the \u2018\u2018evidence jigsaw\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018The jigsaw of evidence I meant was about causal links.

As well as new studies, par-\nticipants recommended the appropriate replication of exist-\ning studies\u2014for example, testing the same intervention in\ndifferent areas, communities, and time periods.\n(2) Nurturing an \u2018\u2018evaluation culture\u2019\u2019\nOne reason for the lack of relevant evidence was felt by\nparticipants to be the historical absence in the UK of an\n\u2018\u2018evaluation culture\u2019\u2019, meaning a research and policy envir-\nonment within which the evaluation of the outcomes of\ninterventions is common. This situation was contrasted with\nan earlier period in the USA, where in the 1960s and 1970s a\nstrong \u2018\u2018evaluation culture\u2019\u2019 existed and the costs of evalua-\ntion were actually built into social programmes. A 1969\nPresidential Executive Order, for example, mandated that 1%\nof programme budgets were to be spent on evaluation, and\nin 1972 this amounted to $100 million.33 Subsequently it is\npossible to identify a string of studies from this period that\nhave influenced policy. The fostering of an evaluation culture\nin the UK in the policy field was felt by researchers to require\nthe removal of practical barriers, such as the bias towards\nshort term grants, as well as the funding of longitudinal\nresearch, and improving training for researchers in evalua-\ntion and research synthesis methods. Redressing some\nof these problems would, it was felt, help promote the\nproduction, and perhaps the use, of policy relevant evidence.\n(3) Closer engagement between research and policy\nResearchers felt that some policymakers lacked understand-\ning of research and had inflexible ideas about research\nmethods. They could hinder project evaluations by, for\nexample, objecting to certain methodological principles (such\nas randomisation), and were unable to tolerate uncertainties\nin evidence\u2014while their own certainties hindered evaluation.\nResearchers acknowledged, however, that they themselves\nneeded to express uncertainty in a more accessible way, and\nto learn to summarise and disseminate their own research\nmuch more effectively. Researchers proposed that closer\nengagement could be promoted if both parties consulted at\nthe earliest possible stage on tenders, and that more\nresearchers and policy makers should experience periods\nof working in each others\u2019 fields. Secondment of researchers\nto policy units for a period of time and vice versa was one\nsuggestion.\nDISCUSSION\nStarting from the perspectives of researchers and policy-\nmakers, this paper and its companion have considered the\ncurrent evidence base for policies to reduce health inequal-\nities, and how this could be improved. It was striking\nthat there was significant congruence between the views\nof the research and policy communities, suggesting that\nthere may be a common (though not necessarily shared)\nunderstanding.\nThe most noticeable similarity relates to the types of\nevidence thought to have the most powerful impact on policy.\nAlthough evidence based policymaking has sometimes been\nseen as pertaining solely to the use of experimental evidence,\nthis notion was rejected by both sets of participants in\nrelation to the complex issue of inequalities. The research\nleaders outlined a wider raft of evaluative and other quali-\ntative and quantitative evidence that could be used to support\npolicy making around inequalities. This understanding of an\n\u2018\u2018evidence jigsaw\u2019\u2019 accords well with the policymakers\u2019 views\nin our first study (paper 1) of a \u2018\u2018mixed economy\u2019\u2019 of evi-\ndence, in which heterogeneous types of evidence, varying\nwith respect to methodological \u2018\u2018rigour,\u2019\u2019 are brought to bear\non different aspects of any particular policy question. The\ncompelling nature of evidence from qualitative case studies\nof everyday lives was acknowledged by both researchers and\npolicy advisers, as was the (sometimes hidden) impact\nof historical data. This \u2018\u2018evidence jigsaw\u2019\u2019 itself reflects a\nlongstanding awareness in social science and epidemiology\nthat \u2018\u2018appropriateness of evidence\u2019\u2019 is usually more important\nthan \u2018\u2018hierarchies of evidence\u2019\u2019. The notion of \u2018\u2018appropriate\u2019\u2019\nin this study implied that evidence should be matched to the\nresearch question. As the determinants of health inequali-\nties are themselves complex, and socially and historically\ndetermined, different types of data are needed to identify the\nKey points\nN Our previous paper highlighted a concern that much\n\u2018\u2018policy relevant evidence\u2019\u2019 is often ignored, even\nthough this \u2018\u2018wider public health evidence\u2019\u2019 often sets\nthe context within which determinants of health\ninequalities may be created.\nN As a result of this policymakers have recommended\nthat researchers should help policymakers more with\nthe task of piecing together the \u2018\u2018jigsaw of evidence.\u2019\u2019\nN In contrast with what is often thought, these researchers\nshared the concerns expressed by the policymakers\nabout the type and nature of evidence that is currently\navailable. Researchers recognised the importance of\nassembling the jigsaw of evidence for the complex task\nof tackling health inequalities.\nN There are specific actions that can be taken by\nresearchers, policymakers, and funders that can foster\nthe production of meaningful new research around\ninequalities, including the promotion of an evaluation\nculture, more appropriate training for researchers; and\nmaintaining the investment in longitudinal research,\nsuch as large scale cohort studies.\nN There is significant potential for rapid progress to\nbe made in developing both evidence based policy,\nand policy relevant evidence in relation to health\ninequalities.\nPolicy implications\nN Improving the inequalities evidence base requires a\ngreater commitment by policymakers to the outcome\nevaluation of policies.\nN This would entail a certain percentage of intervention\nbudgets being routinely set aside for project evalua-\ntion, with evaluation beginning at the earliest possible\nstage of policy conception.\nN Closer engagement between researcher and policy-\nmakers is required at all stages of the research\nprogress\u2014from tendering onwards.\nN This may imply more common use of cross employ-\nment, with researchers and policymakers working\ntemporarily in each others\u2019 fields.\n820 Whitehead, Petticrew, Graham, et al\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nmechanisms and suggest areas in which to intervene. We still\nneed to move beyond descriptions of processes and mean-\nings, though, towards evaluations of the actual outcomes of\nthose interventions, if progress towards reducing inequalities\nis to be made.\nAside from an acknowledgement by both groups that there\nis a need for less narrow views of what constitutes evidence,\nanother important message to emerge was that there are\nspecific actions that can be taken by researchers, policy-\nmakers, and funders alike that can foster the production of\nmeaningful new research around inequalities. Chief among\nthese actions is the promotion of an evaluation culture,\nentailing appropriate training for researchers; and maintain-\ning the investment in longitudinal research, such as large\nscale cohort studies. Improving the inequalities evidence base\nwould also require a commitment by policy makers to the\noutcome evaluation of policies, with a certain percentage of\nintervention budgets routinely set aside for project evalua-\ntion, with evaluation beginning at the earliest possible stage\nof policy conception. Closer engagement between researcher\nand policymakers would also be required at all stages of the\nresearch progress\u2014from tendering onwards. This may imply\nmore common use of cross employment, with researchers\nand policy makers working temporarily in each others\u2019 fields.\nOn the other hand, specific tasks for researchers include\nexploring more sophisticated means of comparing and\nsynthesising the results of different types of research. This\nalso requires a clear map of the specific studies that are now\nneeded to populate the health inequalities evidence base, and\nmore effective dissemination of research findings. This\nincludes producing more appropriate summaries, and explor-\ning ways to express uncertainty about those findings in an\naccessible way.\nThis study set out to explore differing perspectives on the\nproduction and use of evidence on health inequalities, but\nwhat was perhaps surprising was the extent to which the\nrecommendations from the two groups were complementary,\nrather than conflicting. Researchers were for example aware\nof many of the barriers to the production and effective\ndissemination of their work to the policy community. There\nwas also a common understanding of the need for different\ntypes of evidence to answer different types of policy\nquestion\u2014as well as agreement on the need for better data\non the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies.\nThese findings suggest that there may now be significant\npotential for rapid progress to be made in developing both\nevidence based policy, and policy relevant evidence to tackle\ninequalities in health. These two papers give practical\npointers to both policy and research communities to help\nachieve these two aims.\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nM Whitehead, C Bambra, Department of Public Health, University of\nLiverpool, Liverpool, UK\nM Petticrew, S J Macintyre, M Egan, MRC Social and Public Health\nSciences Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK\nH Graham, Institute for Health Research, University of Lancaster,\nLancaster, UK\nFunding: this study was funded as part of the ESRC\u2019s \u2018\u2018EvidenceNetwork\u2019\u2019\nproject grant number H141251011.
