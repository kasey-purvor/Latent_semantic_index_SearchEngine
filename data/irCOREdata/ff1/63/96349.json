The first is the catastrophe in \nIraq and the rebalancing of forces it entails. The outcome of this for the Arab world is still unclear, \nbut its balance sheet is unlikely to be positive. The second, less salient development, is the second oil \nboom, which is generating a new regional political economy. The contours of this new regional \nsystem have been emerging in a much clearer fashion. Yet, in the shadow of Iraq, little ink has been \nspilled on the fundamental economic changes in the region. This article is a first attempt to describe \nand systematize what is happening. \n \nIn a nutshell, the boom has been driving a new, unprecedented phase of economic integration in the \nArab region. The term \u201cArab economic integration\u201d is evocative of countless inter-governmental \ncooperation projects \u2013 often grandiose, almost always futile. Current developments have little to do \nwith multilateral trade diplomacy, however. Rather, the new phase of integration is characterized by \nthree secular shifts: \n \n\u2022 Business is playing a more important role than government, \n\u2022 Foreign direct investment (FDI) is more important than trade, and  \n\u2022 The Gulf is the pivotal player. \n \nIn the following, I will analyze these shifts in detail. The article will start with a brief summary of \ninter-governmental attempts to foster economic integration, followed by an in-depth discussion of \nchanging patterns of trade and FDI in the region. After some observations on the policies necessary \nto sustain and deepen integration, it will conclude by analyzing the role of the GCC monarchies in the \nemerging regional political economy. \n \nA (very) brief history of Arab economic integration \nAs most other developing countries, the majority of Arab states have seen several decades of \u201cimport \nsubstitution\u201d policies, saddling them with a legacy of high tariffs, heavy state intervention in \nproduction and, in many cases, uncompetitive industries. Due to the reluctance of governments to \nlose control over national industrial policy and fear of losing tariff income, regional attempts of \neconomic integration have yielded modest results. Various regional and sub-regional agreements since \nthe 1950s have aimed at liberalization of trade, capital, and labour flows, but hardly saw consistent \nfollow-up and implementation.  \n \nStates have been reluctant to expose local industries to competition from often very similar industries \nin neighbouring countries or to yield any discretion over trade policy through binding regional \nagreements, not to speak of regional institutions. Multilateral economic agreements were usually \nconcluded in a haphazard fashion and in reaction to regional political developments. They have \nmostly focused on tariff reduction, not addressing regional trade in services (e.g. contracting, financial \nand transport services) or cross-border investments. \n \nThe most recent region-wide initiative, the 1997 Executive Program for Arab Free Trade that was \nsigned by 17 of 22 member states of the Arab League, is no exception to this pattern. The Greater \nArab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) accord stipulates an annual reduction of tariffs by 10%, resulting \neventually in full liberalization of intra-Arab trade by 2007. Although narrow in scope, this would be a \nconsiderable achievement. Many tariffs have indeed been reduced. GAFTA has run into a number of \nspecific problems, however. Due to similar production structures, governments have requested too \nmany exceptions in exactly the areas of manufacturing in which intra-Arab trade is likely to take place. \n\u201cRules of origin\u201d which define a good as regionally produced (and hence eligible for tariff exemption) \nremain unclear. The Arab League lacks follow-up capacity to put pressure on its members to \nimplement their agreements. \n \nBeyond tariffs, intra-Arab exporters have had to cope with sometimes unpredictable and heavy non-\ntariff customs charges. This is closely related to the broader issue of non-tariff trade barriers, which \nremain considerable in most Arab countries and which have not yet been comprehensively addressed \non a regional level. Intrusive and time-consuming goods inspection regimes, unnecessary or unusual \nproduct standards and documentation requirements tend to lift transaction costs in Arab trade above \nglobal averages. Exceptions like Dubai with its swift customs bureaucracy have not inspired \ncomprehensive change elsewhere. Some GAFTA members are not yet in the WTO, further opening \nthe door for non-tariff trade barriers. \n \nSub-regional economic integration also has a very mixed record: The Arab Maghreb Union is \npolitically dormant, as are a number of other agreements in North Africa and Mashreq. The Gulf \nCooperation Council (GCC) alone has had a discernible degree of success in terms of trade \nintegration, creating labour and capital mobility, and setting common standards in various areas of \nregulation. In several areas such as investment, stock market participation, and government \nprocurement, at least some of the GCC governments have extended national privileges to nationals \nof other GCC countries.  \n \nOn the political and administrative level, several fundamental problems of GCC integration remain \nunsolved, however: The 2003 customs union is still not fully implemented, as GCC members request \nexceptions and bilateral agreements of the US with individual GCC states undermine the coherence \nof its external tariff regime. The GCC monetary union has been seriously called into question by \nOman\u2019s recent announcement to opt out and by the reluctance of heads of state to agree on official \nconvergence criteria. Political tensions between Saudi Arabia and its neighbours, particularly Qatar, \ncould throw a spanner into the works of \u201cdeepening\u201d the GCC. \n \nThe new economic dynamism in MENA \nThe stagnation on the political level of regional integration stands in stark contrast to the dynamism \nof the regional economy during the last six years of augmented oil prices. Table 1 below gives some \nbasic aggregate figures on economic developments in Middle East and North Africa since 2000. \n \nTable 1: Overview of MENA economic development \u2013 some aggregate figures \n 1960 1970 1980 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 \nShare in  \nworld \ntotal \n           \nCurrent account balance  \n(% of GDP) .. .. 1.3 4.9 1.5 1.1 2.1 1.5  .. \nExternal debt, total  \n(DOD, million US$) .. 4 822 64 482 145 225 142 993 151 383 161 162 163 934 162 494 .. \nGDP (million US$) .. .. .. 447 482 449 621 439 469 483 413 547 496 632 570 1.43% \nGDP growth (annual %) .. .. 0.4 3.2 3.3 3.9 2.6 5.9 4.6  \nMerchandise exports  \n(million US$) 2 919 8 766 90 244 124 324 107 694 113 161 131 720 170 600 \n \n221 252 2.13% \nTotal reserves  \n(includes gold, million US$) 1 565 3 735 49 046 65 316 76 946 90 055 119 189 140 020 \n \n176 606 3.83% \n \nSource: World Bank Development Indicators \n \nGDP growth rates between 3 and 6% and quickly growing foreign reserves make the economies of \nthe Arab world look much more hopeful than during the gloomy 1990s. Both aggregate reserves and \nannual exports now are larger than aggregate international debt. Balances of payment of most states \u2013 \nincluding non-oil exporters \u2013 have been positive. Expansion is set to continue: The IMF estimates \nreal GDP growth in the Middle East at 5.8% and 5.4% in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The Arab \nworld currently goes through the second oil boom, as oil prices have reached levels comparable to the \n1981 price peak. As important, they are likely to remain above at least 40 US$ for several years due to \nunprecedented capacity constraints in the upstream sector of the international oil market. \n \nGraph 1: World and MENA GDP growth rates compared since 2000 (%) \n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nWorld\nMENA\n \nSource: World Bank Development Indicators \n \nThe boom appears to be more sustained and considerably better managed than the first one in the \n1970s and early 1980s. Especially the governments on the Arabian Peninsula exhibit better \nmanagement capacities and a much more cautious fiscal approach than a quarter of a decade ago. \nLess money is wasted, projects are more targeted, and more reserves are built up and managed in \nmore sophisticated and diversified ways. All this augurs well for stable and sustained economic \nexpansion, improvements in public services and the systematic removal of infrastructural bottlenecks.  \n \nThe most important difference to the last boom however is arguably the role that private business \nplays in sustaining economic growth and in converting the psychological and, lately, fiscal boost of \naugmented oil prices into diversified growth. Large Arab companies \u2013 especially those based in the \nGulf \u2013 have embarked on a rapid investment and expansion drive, with private sector growth \nregularly surpassing the growth of the government sectors. Private managerial expertise is much \nbroader than 20 years ago, and private capital resources are huge thanks to decades of rent \naccumulation. Private wealth in the Middle East has been estimated at 1.5 trillion US$.  \n \nMoreover, although expansionary budgets are welcome, large parts of the Gulf private sectors are \nmuch more independent from state contracts than they used to be, catering to private demand and \ncontributing the majority share to national capital formation.i Importantly, the current economic \nboom in the Gulf started before governments started their oil-based fiscal expansion, being driven by \nprivate investment.ii\n \nGradual trade integration \nThe greater sophistication and diversification of Arab business has contributed to a modest, but \ndiscernible improvement in regional trade integration (see table 2). Most Arab exports have \ntraditionally gone to importers outside of the region. Intra-Arab trade has roughly doubled its share in \nthe overall trade of Arab states during the last two decades, however. Remarkably, the recent export \nboom has led to more than a tripling of intra-Arab trade between 2000 and 2005.  \n \nAt the same time, its share in overall trade still hovers around only 10%. In Asia, by comparison, \nintra-regional trade is about 40% of total trade. More than half of Arab trade tends to consist of the \nglobal commodity of oil, however, which means that the low figures are somewhat misleading. About \na fifth of the total MENA non-oil trade is intra-regional, which is a more respectable score, \ncomparable to that of regional groupings such as Mercosur or ASEAN in Latin America and \nSoutheast Asia respectively. Needless to say, business plays a much larger role in non-oil trade than in \noil trade. \n \nTable 2: Middle East exports by region of destination (US$ \u2018000) \n 1980 2000 2005 \nMiddle East 9.125.560 4,8% 15.428.300 5,8% 47.734.700 8,9% \nAsia 23.643.200 12,5% 74.368.300 27,8% 157.684.000 29,5% \nChina (P.R.: Mainland) 298.964 0,2% 9.323.480 3,5% 29.262.900 5,5% \nDeveloping Countries 45.945.600 24,3% 107.179.000 40,0% 244.568.000 45,8% \nEuropean Union 72.862.300 38,5% 56.858.700 21,2% 101.209.000 18,9% \nUnited States 27.247.200 14,4% 36.388.600 13,6% 63.092.200 11,8% \nWorld 189.246.000 100,0% 267.680.000 100,0% 534.437.000 100,0% \nSource: calculated from IMF Directions of Trade data base \n \nTable 3: Middle East imports by region of origin (US$ \u2018000) \n \n                1980 \n \n                      2000                  2005 \nMiddle East 7.314.840 7,9% 14.888.500 8,6% 48.174.700 12,3% \nAsia 7.867.590 8,5% 29.493.500 16,9% 87.276.000 22,2% \nChina,P.R.: Mainland 853.536 0,9% 5.856.650 3,4% 26.751.000 6,8% \nDeveloping Countries 21.410.600 23,2% 60.493.200 34,7% 185.313.000 47,2% \nEuropean Union 38.612.800 41,8% 63.860.400 36,7% 132.932.000 33,9% \nUnited States 12.065.500 13,1% 21.532.000 12,4% 36.682.600 9,3% \n       \nWorld 92.439.000 100,0% 174.118.000 100,0% 392.628.000 100,0% \nSource: calculated from IMF Directions of Trade data base \n \n \nAlthough the Arab world has not seen industrial development on the scale of newly industrializing \ncountries in Asia or Latin America, intra-regional trade is considerably more diversified than it was 20 \nyears ago.iii Mid-level manufacturing has grown in importance, and diversification and upgrading has \ntaken place in sectors such as steel and aluminium, machinery, plastics, and food processing.  \n \nMore sophisticated industrial goods however by and large remain off-limits. Value added often is \nlimited, much manufacturing only consists of final assembly, and export competitiveness is frequently \nlacking. Industrial structures of neighbouring countries are often very similar, making for limited sub-\nregional complementarity. \n \nWith the partial exceptions of Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and the UAE, the importance of intra-\nindustry trade in overall trade is still rather low, which indicates the absence of advanced production \nstructures and a smooth regional division of labour. Sophisticated exports \u2013 i.e. medium- and high-\ntechnology exports \u2013 only accounted for 16% of the region's total exports in 2003, up from 10.7% in \n1995.iv\n \nWhile industrial structures are relatively similar in most cases, directions of trade differ greatly from \ncountry to country, indicating different levels of integration into the region and its sub-regions. Table \n4 contains the export volumes of a number of important Arab countries broken down by region of \ndestination. Smaller economies such as Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon tend to have a higher share of \nregional as compared to global exports. Political economists would expect this to undermine the \npolitical drive towards trade integration, as larger and more powerful players like Saudi Arabia can be \nexpected to have a lesser economic interest in it.  \n \nIn absolute terms, Saudi Arabia has by far the largest exports into the region, despite their small share \nin the kingdom\u2019s total exports. Conversely, six Arab countries send more than a fifth of their regional \nexports to Saudi Arabia, further underlining its pivotal role in the region. With the partial exception of \nTunisia, North African countries are hardly integrated with the rest of the Arab world, warranting \ntheir analysis as a separate block. The Maghreb has a share of only 6.8% among total intra-Arab \nexports, whereas the shares of GCC and Mashreq countries are 60.6% and 29.5% respectively. \n \n \n                                                 \ni  Cf.

Although the Comoros are member of the Arab League, they were excluded due to their geographical position outside of the Middle East. \nThe IMF Directions of Trade data base contains no data for the Palestinian territories.\n Trade is moreover strongly clustered within sub-regions: 58.0% of the intra-Arab exports of \nthe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries go to other GCC countries, and 57.2% of \nMaghreb trade is with other Maghreb countries. Mashreq countries have the most diversified \nintra-Arab export structures, with only one third of Mashreq Arab trade being with other \nMashreq countries.  \n \nEconometricians disagree on whether regional trade is too low, i.e. whether the potential for \nregional exchange is underexploited due to tariff and other obstacles. Depending on the \nmodel applied, current levels of trade are interpreted as just right or too low by up to 100% \nof current volumes. Considering the still considerable non-tariff trade barriers in the Arab \nworld, there is likely to be some further scope for trade integration, especially between the \nsub-regional blocs. At the same time, the modest share of the MENA region in global GDP \n\u2013 currently around 1.5% \u2013 and its intermediate level of technological development make the \nevolution of a high-powered trading bloc akin to the EU unlikely. \n  \nHowever, looking beyond industrial structures and trade shares at the more fundamental \nlevel of factor endowments, the Arab world arguably is a textbook candidate for economic \nintegration: Whereas some countries are richly endowed with the factors of labor and arable \nland, others are capital-abundant. Different countries are rich in different natural resources; \nnot only oil, but also gas and various minerals. Assets are complementary, and the \nMediterranean is ideally situated to facilitate exchange. Bringing together the comparative \nadvantages and assets of different players should result in a large scale positive-sum game. \n \nThe real story: explosive investment integration \nThe complementarity of assets has arguably been played out in recent years on an \nunprecedented scale. This has however happened less so in the realm of traded goods than \nin that of foreign direct investment: FDI has been at the core of regional economic \nintegration since 2000. It has accelerated much more massively than trade, and is cross-\ncutting sub-regions in a way that commerce has never managed. \n \nTable 5 shows that FDI levels in the Middle East are still modest by global comparison, but \nhave increased very rapidly: The region\u2019s share in global FDI inflows has grown from 0.4% \nin 2000 to 4.1% in 2005. 2006 figures are not available, but are likely to be even higher. \n 7\n Table 5: Annual FDI inflows of MENA states, % of world total \n 1970 1980 1990 2000 2004 2005 \n2005  \nin million \nUS$ \nECONOMY        \n        \n   Northern Africa 3.25% 0.28% 0.55% 0.25% 0.83% 1.39% 12,738 \n     Algeria 0.60% 0.63% 0.00% 0.03% 0.12% 0.12% 1,081 \n     Egypt 0.01% 0.99% 0.36% 0.09% 0.30% 0.59% 5,376 \n     Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 2.36% -1.97% 0.08% 0.01% -0.05% 0.03% 261 \n     Morocco 0.15% 0.16% 0.08% 0.03% 0.15% 0.32% 2,933 \n     Tunisia 0.12% 0.45% 0.04% 0.06% 0.09% 0.09% 782 \n        \nMashreq and Gulf 0.46% -6.05% 0.07% 0.17% 2.20% 2.70% 24,750 \n     Bahrain  -0.76% -0.09% 0.03% 0.12% 0.11% 1,049 \n     Iraq -0.01% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.01% 0.03% 300 \n     Jordan  0.06% 0.02% 0.06% 0.09% 0.17% 1,532 \n     Kuwait 0.19% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.03% 250 \n     Lebanon  -0.02% 0.00% 0.07% 0.27% 0.28% 2,573 \n     Oman 0.02% 0.18% 0.06% 0.01% 0.03% 0.08% 715 \n     Qatar 0.04% 0.02% 0.00% 0.02% 0.17% 0.16% 1,469 \n     Saudi Arabia 0.05% -5.78% 0.15% 0.01% 0.27% 0.51% 4,628 \n     Syrian Arab Republic 0.00% 0.00% 0.04% 0.02% 0.04% 0.05% 500 \n     United Arab Emirates 0.06% 0.18% -0.06% -0.04% 1.18% 1.31% 12,000 \n     Yemen 0.09% 0.06% -0.06% 0.00% 0.02% -0.03% -266 \n        \nWorld 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 916,277 \n Developed economies 71.28% 86.07% 82.16% 81.30% 57.82% 60.67% 555,927 \n Developing economies 28.72% 13.88% 17.80% 18.06% 36.61% 35.00% 320,670 \n  Developing economies  \nExcluding China 28.72% 13.78% 16.07% 15.17% 28.07% 27.09% 248,231 \nLeast Developed Countries 1.15% 0.97% 0.29% 0.29% 1.23% 1.06% 9,680 \nWorld FDI in US$ 13,417 55,272 201,614 1,409,568 710,755 916,277  \nSource: based on UNCTAD data \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8\n Graph 2: Share of Arab countries in world FDI since 1990 (%) \n0.00\n0.50\n1.00\n1.50\n2.00\n2.50\n3.00\n19\n90\n19\n91\n19\n92\n19\n93\n19\n94\n19\n95\n19\n96\n19\n97\n19\n98\n19\n99\n20\n00\n20\n01\n20\n02\n20\n03\n20\n04\n20\n05\n    North Africa\nMashreq & GCC\n \n \n \nIncreased FDI reflects increased local and international confidence in Arab economies in the \ncourse of the recent oil boom and the way it is being managed \u2013 different from the last \nboom, which led to a rapid expansion of imports and the service sectors, but an outflow of \ncapital, as the 1980 column in table 5 shows. The last three years have brought heightened \ninternational interest in the Gulf economies in particular, as extra-regional institutional \ninvestors and industrial players are slowly moving into markets that have seen a progressive \nerosion of national privileges and investment restrictions since the late 1990s.  \n \nDuring the last decade, one third of FDI in the region was intra-Arab, and although no \nprecise figures are available, the share has quite probably grown further in 2005 and 2006 \u2013 \nwhich helps to explain, among other things, why the economies of non-oil states have also \nbenefited from the boom. \n \nIn FDI, the Arab world has seen stronger bottom-up integration than in trade, as private Arab \ninvestors have displayed a growing predilection for regional projects. With large capital \nreserves, growing surpluses and scepticism of Western investment locations after 9\/11, the \ngradually liberalizing region has gained new attractiveness for Gulf investors. Their asset \nallocation by and large is much more sophisticated than during the 1970s boom, as many of \nthem have transformed from rentiers to entrepreneurs and take active interest in the projects \nthey invest in. The geopolitical atmosphere has newly rekindled an interest in Arab and Islamic \nmarkets, and liberalization and privatization policies in various neighbouring countries are \nopening opportunities which were not available two decades ago. \n \nThis is not to say that regional investors do not face considerable hurdles in plowing their \ncapital back into the region. Although gradually liberalizing, the governments of the Arab \nworld have not changed overnight. Entrepreneurs have to face bureaucratic opacity, \ncomplex and outdated regulations, intransparent licensing policies, judiciaries moving at a \nglacial pace and, frequently, outright corruption. Setting up projects can be time-consuming \n 9\n and subject to uncalled for bureaucratic interventions. That so many investors decide to \nbrave this environment underlines their dedication and resources. \n \nWhere does the money go? The following overview draws on a comprehensive database of \nregional investment projects assembled over the last two years. \n \nFDI in the Mashreq \nFirst of all, an existing tradition of Gulf investment in the Mashreq has been considerably \ndeepened in recent years, covering a plethora of sectors:  \n \nIndustrial projects. Gulf investors have been particularly active in the relatively advanced \nEgyptian manufacturing sector. Big names active there include the Saudi Al-Zamil group and \nthe Kuwaiti Khorafi group. Saudi Savola Group purchased the Egyptian Fertilizers \nCompany for 800 million US$ last December and is building a large sugar refinery. Other \nprojects currently in the pipe in Egypt include a Kuwaiti-Saudi refinery for 1 billion US$ and \na steel plant by the Saudi Tuwairiqi group. Kuwaiti investors have also initiated a 230 million \nUS$ cement project in Jordan, and Qatar has been considering a refinery project in Lebanon.  \n \nTourism and real estate projects: This is the sector with the largest capital commitments. Regional \nreal estate leader Emaar from Dubai is developing the 4 billion US$ Cairo Hills commercial \nand recreation community as well as the 1.7 billion US$ Marassi tourist resort for in Egypt. \nDubai-based Al Futtaim Group has announced investments of 3.5 billion US$ to build a new \nresidential area on 1750 hectares of New Cairo, Cairo Festival City. Damac Holding Group, \nalso of the UAE, has announced a residential and tourism project on Egypt\u2019s Red Sea coast \nwhich is supposed to grow to up to 16.3 billion US$. \n \nIn Jordan, the 1 billion US$ Royal Metropolis project is also financed mostly through Gulf \ninvestment companies. Saudi Oger and Jordanian real estate company Mawared are \nexecuting another 1 billion US$ urban regeneration project in Amman, in which Kuwait \nProjects Company (KIPCO) has a 400 million US$ share. Emaar Jordan, along with a group \nof regional and Jordanian investors, has formed The Dead Sea Company that will develop a \nluxury mixed-use realty project for 500 million US$. \n \nIn Lebanon, Gulf investors have reportedly invested a total of 3.5 billion US$ in local real \nestate, constituting 40% of total realty investments; large players there include Abu Dhabi \nInvestment House, Dubai\u2019s Habtoor Group, Dubai Islamic Bank as well as private Saudi \ninvestors. \n \nEven \u201cdifficult\u201d Syria is seeing the development of large Gulf-financed tourism ventures, \nwith Emaar planning a 4 billion US$ project. The Aref Group of Kuwait has started a 2 \nbillion US$ development to create a new finance and business district in Damascus. Saudi \nPrince Waleed is majority shareholder in the new Four Seasons hotel in central Damascus; \nMajid Al-Futtaim from the UAE and Saudi Bin Laden Group are planning further projects. \nTogether with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reportedly are the largest foreign investors \nin Syria. \n \nTelecoms. This is a sector in which Gulf multinational companies such as Kuwait\u2019s MTC and \nthe UAE\u2019s Etisalat have rapidly spread across the region in recent years. An Etisalat-led \n 10\n consortium bought the third Egyptian mobile phone license for 2.9 billion US$ last summer. \nAt the same time, Bahraini Batelco acquired a 96% stake in Jordan\u2019s mobile firm Umniah for \n415 million US$. In September, Kuwait\u2019s Wataniya won the second Palestinian mobile \nphone license. \n \nFinance. Banking is an area in which the Gulf business classes have gathered particularly deep \nexperience since the 1970s, whereas banking sectors in most other Arab countries have \natrophied under state control. The last year has seen numerous smaller acquisitions and new \nventures. In April, Kuwait\u2019s Global Investment House acquired a 22 per cent stake in the \nJordan-based bank Societe Generale De Banque \u2013 Jordanie. In September, Dubai-based \nAbraaj Capital acquired 25% of Egypt\u2019s EFG-Hermes investment bank. \n \nGulf investors have also been the most prominent actors in the newly liberalizing Syrian \nfinancial sector, where numerous smaller banks and insurance companies have been called \ninto being. Participants include the Saudi Dallah Al Baraka group, UAE\u2019s Emirates Bank \nInternational, Qatar National Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank, Commercial Bank of \nKuwait and Al-Shall Company and Investment Dar of Kuwait. Several Gulf investors have \nalso moved into the Iraqi banking sector, including Bahrain\u2019s United Gulf Bank, Ahli United \nBank, and Kuwait\u2019s Iraq Holding.  \n \nFDI in the Maghreb \nHardly smaller in scale, Gulf investment in Maghreb countries has emerged as a new intra-\nregional phenomenon. It is of far greater importance than the still small trade between \nMaghreb and other Arab states. \n \nTourism and real estate projects. Again leading the pack, the UAE\u2019s Emaar has started half a \ndozen large tourism and realty ventures in Morocco. Together with Dubai International \nProperties, a subsidiary of Dubai Holdings, it has committed more than 19 billion US$ of \ninvestment over the next 10 years. Bahrain\u2019s Gulf Finance House is developing the 1.4 \nbillion US$ Gateway to Morocco tourism and residential project, while property firm Qatari \nDiar aims to build a resort with hotels, holiday homes and a golf course near Tangier for 335 \nmillion US$. Bahrain-based RealCapita and Morocco's Jet Asset Management have formed a \njoint venture that plans to spend 400 million US$ on social housing projects in Morocco \nover four years.  \n \nLast April, Emaar Properties also announced plans to develop the 1.9 billion US$ \u201cAl-\nQussor\u201d project on Tunisia\u2019s eastern coastline. Similar large-scale tourism projects have \nrecently been envisaged for Libya and Algeria, countries which are often considered as too \nunpredictable and bureaucratic for Western investors. Sharjah-based Tameer has announced \nplans to undertake a combined residential, commercial and tourist project in Libya with a \ntotal volume of up to 20 billion US$. Emaar has entered a joint venture to set up a \ndevelopment zone in Libya and has been negotiating large-scale deals with the Algerian \ngovernment. \n \nTelecoms. A consortium of Dubai\u2019s Tecom and Dubai Investment won a tender for shares in \nTunisie Telecom last year. The group paid 2.25 billion US$ for a 35% stake in the company, \nwhich holds a fixed-line monopoly and competes against Tunisiana for mobile customers \u2013 a \njoint venture of Kuwait\u2019s Wataniya and Egypt\u2019s Orascom. Wataniya is also present in \n 11\n Algeria, where it runs the mobile phone service Nedjma. Further telecoms investments are \nbound to happen in coming years. \n \nGulf investment in Maghreb finance and industry is smaller-scale, but nonetheless actively \ndeveloping, with a special focus on Algeria. Saudi magnate Saleh Kamel\u2019s Baraka bank is \nactive there, and Bahrain\u2019s Al Salam Bank has acquired a licence to launch an Islamic bank \nwith a paid up capital of 100 million US$. Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala Development Company is \nengaged in a build, own and operate (BOO) project together with Canadian SNC-Lavalin for \na 1200 MW power plant in western Algeria. In March 2006, Saudi pipe producer Amiantit \nannounced manufacturing joint ventures in Algeria and Morocco. \n \nFDI in the Arab periphery \nGulf investors have not shied away from harsher environments on the Arab periphery such \nas Sudan or Djibouti. In these places, they tend to dominate non-oil FDI. \n \nSudan. Investors from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 again including Emaar \u2013 have \nlaunched several projects in Sudan. Kuwaiti investors have initiated a 70 million US$ project \nto upgrade the Nile port of Juba in Southern Sudan and a 40 million US$ project for a luxury \nhotel in the same town. Much larger Sudanese real estate projects have been announced with \nthe involvement of large Saudi business players such as Juma Al-Juma, the Alireza and \nJamjoum families. Details remain unclear, however. \n \nWhereas real estate is still in its infancy, Gulf investors already have a firm foothold in the \nSudanese telecommunications sector: Kuwait\u2019s MTC has assumed full control of leading \nSudanese mobile operator Mobitel in February 2006, paying 1.33 billion US$ for the 61% of \nthe company which it did not already control. The UAE\u2019s Etisalat holds a license for a \nsecond fixed-line network and a stake in former monopolist Sudatel. Gulf money has also \ngone into shares in several Sudanese banks and into the IPO of Al Salam Bank Sudan, which \nwas organized in 2004.  \n \nDjibouti. Dubai has also taken the lead in investing in Djibouti, which harbours ambitions to \nbecome a local trading hub for Northeast Africa. In February 2006, Dubai\u2019s DP World \ninaugurated the Doraleh Oil Terminal project, a 240,000 metric tonne facility which it will \nmanage for Djibouti\u2019s government. DP World also intends to build a new container terminal \nin Doraleh for 300 million US$.  \n \nAltogether, Dubai is estimated to be working on projects worth 800 million US$ in Djibouti, \nincluding a free zone and hotel facilities. The intention patently is to make Djibouti a mini-\nhub for the surrounding sub-region, corresponding to Dubai\u2019s own model. \n \nFurther vehicles of investment integration \nCapital is also recycled within the region through non-FDI channels, i.e. various forms of \nportfolio investment. These include a wide variety of usually Gulf-based investment funds \nactive in infrastructure, energy, utilities or real estate projects, often benefiting from the \nregion\u2019s governments\u2019 increasing willingness to draw on private capital to finance public \nfunctions. Recent years have also seen an emerging buyout and private equity industry in the \nregion as well as smaller-scale venture capital funds.  \n \n 12\n Portfolio investment opportunities have also been broadened by the increasing breadth of \nregional stock markets. In early 2006, non-Jordanian investment was estimated to make up \nabout 45% of Jordan's stock market capitalisation, with Gulf capital playing a leading role. \nSimilarly, some 30% of the investment on the Egyptian stock market was estimated to be \nGulf money, half of it Saudi. These shares have been fluctuating, and non-Gulf stock \nmarkets were affected by the slow-motion crash that GCC capital markets have seen since \nlate 2005.  \n \nNevertheless, the injection of Gulf capital has created new opportunities for start-ups and \nthe creation of companies which operate on a regional level. Local entrepreneurs can tap \nGulf capital through offering their companies to public subscription. Even Syria is planning \nto open a stock market this year. Arab bourses suffer from typical emerging market ailments, \nbut the very presence of for cross-border stocks investment is a substantial step ahead, while \nthe emergence of institutional investors is likely to gradually improve governance. \n \nThe Gulf and its networks \nWith projects in the billion-dollar range, some of the enormous overseas capital resources of \nthe Gulf bourgeoisie \u2013 estimated at 800 billion US$ or more \u2013 have clearly been unlocked in \nrecent years. The repatriation of even small share of this wealth can make a big difference to \nregional capital formation.  \n \nThe new pattern of capital recycling reflects a larger regional shift in business capacities: \nMost of the largest Arab investment consortia and companies are now located in the Gulf, \neven if they often have a considerable share of non-Gulf Arabs in their management. \nAmong a 2006 Forbes Arabia list of the 50 best performing companies in the Arab world, \nthere were 22 Saudi companies and 11 UAE companies alone. Although some regional \nchampions are also emerging outside of the GCC, notably Egypt\u2019s Orascom Telecom, these \ntend to be the exception.  \n \nMany of the new large-scale investment projects are set up as investment enclaves with \nlimited linkages to the local economy, and intra-Aran investment arguably is too dominated \nby real estate projects. However, there is undeniable tourism potential in most Arab \ncountries, not least as rich (and increasingly richer) Arabs are more and more looking for \ntourism opportunities and second residences in Arab Muslim countries as opposed to the \nWest. From a local perspective, regional rent recycling is vastly preferable to just parking \nmoney in Western bonds and investment funds. \n \nAnd although capital flows from GCC to other Arab countries are largely one-way, they are \nwelcome thanks to their domestic employment effects and the fact that they do not bring \nalong as strong economic displacement effects as trade. Some Gulf attempts to take over \npublicly owned industries have led to political backlashes in the host countries, e.g. when \nSaudi conglomerate Savola intended to buy state-owned sugar mills in Morocco. \nInvestments in new ventures \u2013 the clear majority of projects \u2013 do not face such problems \nhowever, even if some locals may secretly grumble over overweening Gulf magnates. \n \nThere is a speculative element in some of the realty ventures, and the scale of some of them \nmight be overestimated. Surplus Gulf capital will grow further and continue to look for \nregional outlets, however; and even if only half of the envisaged investment gets realized, it \n 13\n will make a very substantial contribution to the smaller economies of the non-oil states. \nAlthough some projects probably will not get off the ground and others might not turn out \nto be profitable, the region is unlikely to see white elephants on the scale of the 1970s or \n1980s.  \n \nPrivate companies and independently managed, profit-oriented public companies dominate \ncross-border investment, resulting in projects which are based on economic rather than on \nsymbolic or political criteria as often was the case with government-driven undertakings in the \npast. As far as public investment agencies play a role in regional capital recycling, they also \nact more strongly on economic criteria. This is not to say that politics plays no role in \ninvestment decisions of public companies or investment agencies, but it does so only after \nminimal profitability estimates have been made. \n \nCross-border investment leads to a significant deepening of networks among regional \nbusiness and government elites. Gulf investors can draw on their local skills as Arabs, their \nknowledge of regional business and bureaucratic cultures, and on personal networks of the \nlarge non-Gulf Arab communities in the GCC: although the number of Arab workers in the \nGulf has decreased over the decades, Arabs continue to be strongly present in managerial \nstrata there. All this allows Gulf companies to operate in relatively hostile investment \nenvironments in the Arab world in which large Western companies do not tread as easily. \nConversely, Mashreq businesspeople have been investing in GCC countries which offer a \nmore liberal investment climate than their home countries, and to which they have personal \nlinks built up in the 1970s and 1980s. \n \nArab governments outside of the Gulf have been actively soliciting FDI from the GCC. \nNew bilateral investment offices are opened in the Gulf, large conferences for Gulf investors \nheld, and privatization initiatives are announced with a specific view to attracting Gulf \ncapital. Several of the big Emaar deals were negotiated with the involvement of senior \npolitical figures in Maghreb and Mashreq. \n \nA healthy competition for Gulf capital has started \u2013 a process in which business tends to \ndrive politics rather than the other way round. Within the GCC in particular, a virtuous \ncompetition for better FDI governance is taking off. Qatar and Bahrain are acutely aware of \nDubai\u2019s attractiveness as business hub with a smooth administrative environment, and are \ntrying to create their own special zones and administrations to attract or at least retain \ncapital. Even the generally immobile Saudi government is now promoting new \u201ceconomic \ncities\u201d following the Dubai model of investment enclaves. Cross-border capital flows and \nFDI within the GCC itself have been growing strongly in recent years. \n \n---------------- \nIn trade and more so investment terms, the Arab world today is best understood as a system \nthat is increasingly centred around the Arabian Peninsula. The Mashreq countries have a \ntradition of relatively intense trading relations with the Gulf and have deepened their existing \nrole as investment destination for Gulf capital. The Maghreb remains peripheral to Arab \ntrade, but has recently emerged as an important investment location for Gulf money. Private \ninvestment has taken over official aid as main component of cross-border capital flows. \n \nA policy perspective \n 14\n Though economics has overtaken politics in processes of Arab economic integration, the \nlatter has political externalities. For one, cross-border capital flows increase the \ninterdependence of Arab countries to a higher degree than trade ever could. With assets \nspread across the region, the costs of diplomatic, economic or military conflict increase. This \nis a good reason for external players to support regional economic integration. And although \nthe integration process is playing out more strongly in favor of the Gulf, the FDI recipients \nalso have a clear interest in attracting and retaining capital \u2013 if only because they are capital-\npoor and prefer to diversify away from exclusive dependence on Western FDI. \n \nAlbeit Arab governments cannot micro-manage economic integration, they can do a lot \nmore to facilitate it. In this context, it will be crucial to give inter-governmental cooperation \nin the region a new focus. What has to be tackled is not mainly trade tariffs, it is \nadministrative reform and regulatory convergence. All too often, investors are still held back \nby opaque rules and institutions \u2013 especially smaller ones who have less political weight to \nthrow around, but whose aggregate capital resources are as impressive as those of the large \nconglomerates. \n \nFDI requires policies that transcend traditional trade rules of cross-border exchange and deal \nmost of all with domestic regulatory structures. Arab economic integration should not least \nbecome a program for targeted bureaucratic reform and standardization. This is a tall order, but \nthe returns in terms of reducing transaction costs and utilizing regional complementarities in \nterms of factor endowments are enormous. Issues that would need to be tackled include the \nstandardization of investment regulations, dispute settlement and accounting procedures, \nstreamlined and non-discriminatory licensing, principles of mutual recognition, regional \nstandards, and a predictable legal environment for foreign actors. This will also help in moving \nthe Arab world towards compliance with the WTO\u2019s General Agreement on Trade in Services \n(GATS). \n \nEven in trade, addressing non-tariff, institutional barriers has been shown to yield higher \neconomic returns than sheer tariff reduction.v Growth effects of service and FDI integration \nare more difficult to model than those of trade integration, but are likely to be much more \nsubstantial. \u201cDynamic gains\u201d through competition effects, technological upgrades, economies of \nscale etc. are likely to be especially high in FDI and services.vi The scale of current investment, \nwhich is happening despite considerable obstacles, indicates the potential of further \nliberalization. \n \nEvery regime is politically constrained in its reform efforts. It is all the more important to create \nregional awareness of how important certain types of administrative reforms are, and to set clear \nbenchmarks to evaluate change, e.g. through a new regional FDI agreement. International \nstandards are often available in the form of specific WTO protocols, which could in a phase of \ntransition be applied only regionally or sub-regionally. Reforms need to be broken down \ninstitution by institution in order to build coalitions for change and avoid cross-cutting \nbureaucratic obstruction. Regional reporting requirements and supervision arrangements, \npossibly organized through a beefed-up Arab League secretariat, could help to enable follow-up \nand increase peer pressure. Private sectors should be included in regional policy deliberation. \nAlthough reforms by and large have to be negotiated domestically, a regional \u201chook\u201d could \ngreatly help to focus the process, make it less threatening and make the rewards appear more \ntangible. \n 15\n  \nOutlook: the GCC\u2019s pivotal role \nThe paradigm of state-directed economic integration has become obsolete in the Arab \nworld; states can at best be facilitators. Concurrently, the Gulf has become the pivot of the \nregional political economy, as it harbors the most capable and capital-rich private sectors. \nThe larger political consequences of all this for the region are not yet clear. The trends \nanalyzed here are important enough, however, to warrant some speculation. \n \nWith its emerging role as dominant economic hub of the region, the GCC arguably is a potential \nanchor of stability in the Arab world: Relatively weak in military terms, it has a vested interest in \npolitical calm, as it can then play out its economic muscle. At a time at which American \nhegemony has become of questionable value even to its \u201cmoderate\u201d allies, the GCC might be \nwilling to play a more assertive role based on its economic resources. \n \nNeedless to say, no amount of Gulf capital can buy stability if facing a mess of epic \nproportions as in Iraq (although Gulf money has been helping significantly in shoring up the \neconomy of the war-wrecked country). Still, the \u201csoft power\u201d of Gulf capital is not an \nacademic point: As more and more GCC money is channeled into Syria for example, Gulf \npolitical influence there is bound to increase. A regime in rather dire economic straits, Syria \nwill be increasingly reluctant to alienate Gulf governments \u2013 which are not capable of micro-\nmanaging the investment decisions of their business classes, but can certainly use their moral \nsuasion to indicate which investment destination is not palatable. Similarly, Gulf FDI \nimparts considerable soft power in Lebanon, where it will play an important role in \nreconstruction. \n \nThis is not to say that economics always trump politics. The more ideological regional \npolitics becomes, the less the Gulf can play out its economic power. Nonetheless, at least in \ninter-state relations, the dynamics have shifted: As a full clash with Israel has become \nincreasingly unthinkable, and no Arab regime has mounted a military challenge to any of its \nneighbors since Saddam\u2019s Gulf war, military power is of declining utility in today\u2019s Arab \nworld. In the absence of a full-scale clash with Iran, economic power will increasingly come \nto the fore in defining intra-Arab relations. And this power largely emerges from the Gulf, \nthrough its business classes and their rapidly increasing regional investment. \n \n \n                                                 \nv  Denise Eby Konan, Alternative Paths to Prosperity: Economic Integration Among Arab Countries (University \nof Hawaii 2002). \nvi  Free trade in the Euromed area \u2013 combining EU and Arab countries \u2013 is expected to yield static gains of \naround 2% of GDP, whereas dynamic effects of deep integration including services and FDI are estimated between 4 \nand 20% depending on the depth of integration.
