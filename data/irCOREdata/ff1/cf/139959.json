There are, however, still few \nfemale role models at the top of companies. This project explores how young career-\nminded women use role models. It draws on previous research into how \nprofessionals experimented with their identity projections to become partners in US \nprofessional service firms. In-depth interviews with ten young professional women \nrevealed that they actively draw on role models from different domains. In some \ncases, the role models were personally known to the individual women, whilst in \nother cases, they were personally unknown to them. The women revealed that they \npreferred to use the learning from external role models rather than focus on individual \nwomen from the top of their own professions. This research adds richness to our \nunderstanding of young female managers\u2019 use of role models, and contributes up-to-\ndate empirical evidence in a field which has been somewhat neglected in recent \nyears. \nKey words:  Role Models, Women, Identity, Managers, Careers, Development \n \n \nIntroduction \nRole models are often said to be key to the \nsuccessful development of young aspiring \nmanagers. Role models, according to Shapiro, \nHaseltine & Rowe (1978) are individuals whose \nbehaviours, styles and attributes are emulated by \nothers. Unlike mentors, who are always \u201cclose\u201d in \nthat they are personally known in an interactive \nrelationship with the young individual, role models \noften are not acquainted with the role model user, \nnor do they give their permission to be used in this \nway. Hence, role models may be close or distant to \nthe role model user.  \nIn the Catalyst study of barriers for women\u2019s careers, \nthe 500 European women reported the lack of \nfemale role models as the second biggest barrier \n(after stereotyping) to career success (Catalyst, \n2003). There are few recent research reports into \nrole modelling, the exception being Gibson (2003, \n2004), who makes a strong case for reinvigorating \nthe role model construct. The research literature has \nup to now focused on the related but more \ninteractive phenomenon of mentoring rather than \nrole modelling (Javidan, Bemmels, Devine and \nDastmalchian, 1995). But little is known about how \nwomen choose or use role models. Role models may \nderive from a variety of domains, but again, there \nappears to be little research reported on role models \nand domains. The aim of this paper is to address \nthat gap. We first consider the literature on role \nmodels, particularly for women aspiring to become \nmanagers. We pursue the idea of role model \npatterns as a framework for understanding role \nmodel development in a similar way to Higgins & \nKram\u2019s (2001) identification of mentoring sets. We \nthen report findings from an empirical exploratory \nstudy in the UK of young women\u2019s role models, and \ntheir use of them. We conclude with suggestions for \nfurther research and consider implications for \npractice. \nRole Model Theory \nSocial learning theory is useful in explaining how role \nmodelling functions (Bandura, 1977). People \nobserve the behaviour of others in given situations, \nand note the outcomes of those behaviours. \nConsequently, they use this knowledge to shape \ntheir own behaviour in similar contexts with \n 2\n  \nexpectations of similar outcomes. They are \nsocialised into an appreciation of the values, abilities, \nexpected behaviours and social knowledge essential \nfor their new roles, particularly in organisational life \n(Louis, 1980). Through emulation of observed \nbehaviours and career paths of their role models, the \nyoung managers and professionals enact their new \nroles (Schein, 1968; Hill, 1992).   \nSo who are the role models drawn on for inspiration \nabout careers? They may be existing leaders in a \nvariety of fields, who display certain qualities, \ncharacteristics, attitudes and behaviours that are \ninspirational to others as models for the successful \nintegration of self and the new career (Chung, 2000; \nScarnati, 2002). Early role models are usually \nparents, modelling standards and providing a \nfoundation for the development of their young \noffspring. Later role models are sought from a wider \narena, and eventually, as careers become more \nimportant, from the corporate, entrepreneurial or \nprofessional worlds (Gibson, 2003). Often role \nmodels are selected because of the way in which \nthey have overcome particular barriers seen as \nrelevant by the users. The role models\u2019 behaviours \nare examined for guidance as to what is appropriate \nfor particular organisations, for the level aspired to by \nthe user, and relevance for the particular culture and \ncontext within which users are building their identity. \nIn a qualitative study of 22 investment bankers and \n21 management consulting professionals, Gibson \n(2003) found career stage differences in the \nconstruction of role models, with early stage \nrespondents drawing positive inferences from \nmodels who were close to them, to establish their \nself-concept, whilst middle and late stage \ninterviewees drew on role models for guidance in \nrefining and affirming their self-concept. Lockwood \nand Kunda (1997) reported that superstars are often \nselected as role models, when there is some \nrelevance for the comparison, for example race, \ngender and personality, and grounds for belief that \ncomparable success could be achieved. Whilst the \nsuperstars are often to be found in the same domain \nof excellence as the role model user, this is not an \nessential requirement. In the Lockwood and Kunda \nstudy, future teachers and accountants were inspired \nby leaders of the same gender as themselves in their \nprofessions.  An important part of the value of role \nmodels is that they demonstrate the possibility of \nattainment for those similar to them. In this respect, \nthey are symbols of possibility, offering inspiration, \nand removing uncertainty \u2013 the fact that role models \nhave got there means that it is possible to do so, \naccording to Chung (2000). He advocates affirmative \naction so that role models can play this role out more \neffectively through greater numbers.  \nBuilding a Professional Identity \nAs young people build their professional identities, \nthey may draw on partial or total role models, and on \npositive or negative traits and behaviours as part of \nthe learning process (Shapiro, Haseltine and Rowe, \n1978; Lockwood, Jordan and Kunda, 2002; Gibson, \n2003, 2004). Indeed, Shapiro et al. are not so \npositive about the usefulness of role models, \nespecially in terms of helping women gain promotion, \nin contrast to mentors who are likely to be helpful. \nThey distinguished between total and composite role \nmodels. There was a danger for women who sought \ntotal role models, i.e. a single \u201cidealised\u201d person \nwhose persona, behaviours and context incorporated \nall the characteristics identified by the user as \nessential for career success, as this was likely to be \nunrealistic. It is just as likely that a young role model \nuser will draw on a number of individuals, selectively \nobserving and copying what appears to be effective \nfor career and life success. Bucher and Stelling \n(1977) found that students and young professionals \nexercised considerable judgement in the partial \nselection of role models. They too warned against \nfemales seeking only total role models and using \nonly female role models for emulation. With both \nsexes in the role model set, young men and women \ncould draw on a wider and more balanced range of \nbehaviours to create a composite \u201cideal self\u201d for their \nown aspiration as professionals. \nIbarra (1999) explored the development of 35 young \nprofessionals through the construction of provisional \nidentities, as they progressed to more senior roles. \nThe young consultants and investment bankers \nobserved role models to identify potential identities, \nexperimented with their provisional selves, and \nevaluated these experiments. The less successful \ntended to use total role models, whilst the more \nsuccessful individuals constructed a composite \ntemplate from several different role models. The \nprocess of identity formation in organisations \ndescribed by Ashforth (1998) is relevant here, as \nindividuals unfreeze their present identity, change it, \nand then refreeze it in the new mould when they \nhave found the appropriate identity and behaviours \nto be effective in the new role. \nIn a qualitative study into key influences on directors\u2019 \ncareers, Vinnicombe, Singh and Sturges (2000) \nfound that women directors used role models to see \nwhat worked and what did not work, through their \nearly interactions with board members. In these \ncases, the role models were more senior, close in \nterms of location, and personally known and \nobserved by the female role model users in \npreparation for their director roles. Lockwood et al. \n(2002) found that individuals who were promotion-\noriented were more motivated by positive role \nmodels, whereas those who sought to prevent \n 3\n  \ntrouble were more motivated by negative role models \nwho indicated ways of avoiding failure. But previous \nwork on role models often has been undertaken in \nclassroom conditions with students who may never \nhave experienced organisational life (e.g. Lockwood \nand Kunda, 1997)). Hence more work is needed on \nsamples who have worked in organisations, at a later \nstage of career development and investment. Gibson \nhas renewed the interest in this area, mapping out \nthe theoretical base for studies into role modelling, \nand suggesting more research into role model sets \n(Gibson, 2004). \nLack of Female Role Models for Women \nAs people seek role models as part of their career \ndevelopment, they often search for individuals with \nsimilar backgrounds to themselves. However, for \nminority individuals, including women, this can be \ndifficult. Young women are often said to be \ndisadvantaged by the lack of female role models at \nthe top of organisations. Indeed, a Catalyst (2000) \nsurvey of current MBA students in the USA reported \nthat 87% of women and 77% of men said that it was \nimportant or very important to feature more women \nbusiness leaders as role models. However, in an \nearlier Canadian public sector study of 1579 senior \nmanagers, Javidan et al. (1995) found that female \nsubordinates had no problems in accepting superiors \nof either sex as role models. In contrast, they found \nthat male subordinates did not see their female \nsuperiors as role models. The critical factor for \nacceptance of a role model by both sexes was \nwhether the subordinate perceived the superior to be \nsuccessful or not, but the sex difference indicates \npersistence of the think manager, think male \nsyndrome (Schein and Mueller, 1992).  \nThere are very few women at board level in UK \nprivate sector companies, and only 4% of executive \ndirectors in the UK\u2019s top 100 companies are female \n(Singh and Vinnicombe, 2004). Women do not see \nthemselves mirrored in the leadership, nor do others \nsee women there, and this is likely to prolong the \nsex-role stereotyping of leadership as masculine.  \nChanging Working Context \nWork-life balance has become a key issue for many \nof today\u2019s managers, particularly for women (Bailyn, \nDrago and Kochan, 2001). Hence, the way in which \nsome high profile women manage their work\/life \nbalance has become of great interest in the media, \nand the few women who do apparently manage this \nwell are role models for many younger female \nmanagers. As early as 1978, Shapiro et al. noted \nthat selection of role models was encompassing \npatterns of how to manage work\/life issues as well \nas \u2018on-the-job\u2019 behaviours. However, younger \nwomen may reject as role models the women at the \ntop who do not have children. They are sometimes \nseen as having given up an essential part of their \nemotional and social capital to achieve success on \nmasculine terms. Ely\u2019s (1994) study indicated that \nwomen in male-dominated professional firms were \nmore likely to report that the women partners were \nnot good role models because they were forming \nthemselves in male moulds (e.g. working all hours, \nand laughing at sexist jokes), and were considered \nto be unlikely to facilitate the careers of more junior \nwomen. In contrast, women in sex-balanced firms \nreported women partners to be good role models \n(professional, stylish, accessible, and encouraging).  \nWomen may also find role models outside the \nbusiness world, perhaps in their social world, their \nfamily or community. Yet no academic studies were \nfound about the sets and diversity of role models \nchosen by women aspiring to leadership, nor about \nthe patterning of domains from which they are \ndrawn. This study therefore explores the role models \nof young women between the ages of 25 and 37, at \na career stage where they have invested in higher \neducation and have some experience of working in \norganisations. \nA Developmental Network Perspective on Role \nModels \nHiggins and Kram (2001) identified a matrix of four \ndifferent developmental networks of types of \nmentors. Developmental networks of mentors are \ndefined as the set of people named by a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as \ntaking an active interest and action to advance their \ncareer by providing developmental assistance. \nTaking a similar approach, the set of role models \nreported by an individual could be seen as a network \nproviding both near and active as well as distant and \npassive career guidance. Young women use senior \nwomen and men as remote role models, as well as \ncloser role models such as managers and mentors. \nAs work-life balance is of increasing importance to \nwomen seeking management positions, we would \nexpect to find that role model sets of a proportion of \nambitious young women would include role models \nof work-life balance as well as high career \nattainment. This study explores the nature of the role \nmodel sets held by our sample of young women \nmanagers. In particular, we consider the number of \nrole models, the sex of the role models, whether the \nrole models are near or distant, and the learning \nacquired from the role models, as well as the number \nof domains from which the role models have been \ndrawn. Some role models were in several domains \n(for example, a working mother role model might be \nin the female, family and business domains). \n 4\n  \nMethodology \nSample  \nYoung women attending a career seminar at a \nleading UK management school were invited to take \npart. Ten young professional women were \ninterviewed, with ages between 25 and 37, average \nage 32. Six had postgraduate degrees and four had \nadvanced professional qualifications. On average, \nthey had eleven years of work experience including \nfour years of project leadership, junior management \nor senior professional experience. Eight were British, \nand two were Japanese women currently based in \nthe UK with their partners. None of the interviewees \nhad children. \nData Collection \nAs this was an exploratory study, an interpretive \napproach was appropriate. Data gathering was \nthrough in-depth interviews, with questions sent in \nadvance so that reflective responses could be made. \nEach interview lasted between 1-1\u00bd hours, and was \ntaped and transcribed. Interview questions covered \nthe following: \n\u2022 Who are the role models, why have they been \nchosen, and the key characteristics of each \nperson cited. Relevance of each role model for \nown career, and what has been learnt from the \nrole model. \nInterviewees were also asked to draw a network map \nof individual set of role models, with domains circled, \nto facilitate discussion of each role model and of the \nrole model set.  \nTranscripts were imported into NVivo software for \nqualitative analysis. Patterns and commonalities \nwere sought in the data, and themes identified and \ncoded into a hierarchical tree structure with branches \nfor role model dimensions, interviewees, learning, \nand set properties and dimensions (Lofland and \nLofland, 1995). The theme of learning was broken \ndown into personal characteristics, life management \nskills, task-related and people-related leadership \nskills.  \nFINDINGS \nThe Role Model Users and their Career Histories \nA recurring theme in the interviews was the issue of \nconfidence, despite these young professionals \nhaving had successful careers to date. Seven of the \nten women indicated lack of confidence (worrying \nabout what people thought them, worried about \npolitics, putting themselves down, being naturally \nshy, concerned about how to influence people), and \nthree of them had been advised to work on their lack \nof confidence for future development. Only one \nreported that a key strength was confidence. Every \none of them said that they were highly motivated and \nhard working. Growing through challenges was an \nimportant feature of their careers, and some of them \nhad high ambitions.  \nThe Role Models  \nThe young women had a variety of role models, \nsome very well known, and in total, 50 role models \nwere identified in their maps, 14 men and 36 women. \nFrom the political world, Margaret Thatcher was \nchosen; similarly, the two Japanese women chose a \nhigh profile Japanese career woman, Madame \nOgata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. \nThe young woman in PR had several news \nrespondents as role models, identifying strongly how \ninspirational they had been in her development from \nan early age. \n\u201cKate Adie \u2013 BBC war correspondent. \nBecause I wanted to be her. As a young \nchild I wanted to be a war \ncorrespondent \u2013 I wanted the \n\u2018excitement\u2019 and the challenge of that \nrole and I always admired her \nindependence and her \u2018spirit\u2019. As I grew \nup I realized how dangerous it was to \nbe reporting on the war. Kate Adie \ndemonstrated that women could be \nequals\u2026anything a man can do\u2026\u201d \nFrom the arts world, role models included a \nJapanese film star.  \n\u201cTomoko Yamaguchi, because she is of \nthe same generation, with a good \ncareer, despite interrupting it when she \ngot married, so it shows you can come \nback and begin again with ambition \u2013 \nthat\u2019s why I admire her, and I am also \nbreaking my career.\u201d \nMarilyn Monroe was mentioned because she worked \nand got what she wanted through working with men, \nand the young TV chef Jamie Oliver was selected for \nhis down-to-earth natural style and consideration for \nfamily relationships.  \n\u201cThe thing I really admire about him is \nthat he doesn\u2019t appear to take life too \nseriously, there seems to be this \nbalance between his passion around \nthe food that he does, and there is \nalways some fun aspect to it, like he \nscoots around London to get \ningredients, all those involved sit down \non a pier and eat it as a picnic.  I just \nlike that relaxed approach, have fun \nalong the way and still come up with the \ngoods.\u201d \n 5\n  \nFrom the music world, Madonna and Kylie Minogue \nwere chosen because they represented success in \ntaking control of one\u2019s life, reinventing oneself, and \nknowing where they wanted to go, even after their \ninitial careers had got stuck.  \n\u201cFrom the age of 14 I admired \nMadonna. She\u2019s been exploited, and \nnow as well as her music, she is a good \nbusinesswoman, and is respected by \ntwo generations. As a woman in her \n40s, she is still a sex icon, she is a \nworking mother, she is confident, she \nhas pushed down the barriers and didn\u2019t \nfollow the rules. She has reinvented \nherself and succeeded in spite of the \nnegative things that happen. I see this \nas empowering for women. She earned \nher success and took control of herself \nand the media.\u201d \nFrom the fictional world, in the Harry Potter age, \nProfessor Dumbledore was selected by one \ninterviewee because he represented good \nleadership, he was fair, always knew what was going \non and allowed others to grow. Another woman \ncommented that her role model was a sort of \nProfessor Dumbledore type. \n\u201cI like him because he is a really good \ndecision-maker. In all the books, he \nsteps in at just the right moment, so it is \nthat balance. When someone comes in \nwith a higher status, that\u2019s pretty critical, \nbecause if it\u2019s done in the right way, it \nallows others to grow around you, and \nshare responsibility, so that they know \ntheir roles.\u201d \nThis choice links to the selection of J K Rowling, the \ncreator of Professor Dumbledore, as a role model by \nanother of the interviewees. Buffy the vampire slayer \nwas yet another fictional role model cited by two \nwomen, as inspiring confidence that women can take \ncharge and overcome challenge, but only one \nincluded Buffy in her role model map. \nFive women reported their mothers (and one \ngrandmother) to be role models, whilst four gave \ntheir fathers and two mentioned sisters. A typical \ncomment: \u201cI look up to my mum. She was originally a \nsecretary, worked her way up to a senior HR \nprofessional role, had two children, and had to work \nher way all the way up again.\u201d None gave brothers \nas role models, although one indicated that she \nmight have included brothers, when we reviewed the \nrole set with her and she realized it was all female. \nFive young women included former bosses, whilst \nthree gave present bosses as role models.  \nAlthough 60% of the role models came from the \nbusiness world, surprisingly few top businesswomen \nwere included. Anita Roddick was given as the \nsuccessful entrepreneur by a young woman whose \nambition included aspirations to reach CEO level. \nShe was also mentioned as inspirational by a young \nwoman in PR, who hoped to start her own business.  \n\u201cAnita Roddick: Chosen because as a \nyoung child I remember seeing her on \nthe news and it was almost unheard of \nto see a young woman pioneering her \ncause and being a successful \nbusinesswoman when many young girls \nthought they would be housewives not \ncareer women. She showed that \nanything was possible even as a \nwoman. It was her entrepreneurial spirit \nand the fact that she believed in \nherself.\u201d  \nThe Role Model Domains \nThe individual role model networks were \ncharacterised by domains with properties of gender, \ndistance (distant or personally known), location \n(workplace, profession, family, business world, \nfriends, etc) as a starting point for analysis. Table I \nprovides a breakdown of the domains from which the \nrole models were drawn. \nFollowing Higgins and Kram\u2019s (2001) developmental \nnetwork typology, we identified two dimensions to \nindividuals\u2019 role model networks. These were: \n\u2022 Whether an individual\u2019s role models came \nfrom a few or multiple domains (seven \ndomains identified, a few being three or less, \nmultiple being four or more); \n\u2022 Whether an individual\u2019s role models were \npredominantly close (personally known to \nthem) or distant (personally unknown to \nthem, or fictional). \n \nIt is clear from Table II that there is a tendency to \nhave personally known role models rather than \ndistant, and to draw them from multiple rather than \nfew domains. Eight of the ten women drew on role \nmodels from at least four domains, and the \nremaining two women drew from three domains. \nSeven of the women had a preference for close role \nmodels, and one had equal numbers of close and \ndistant role models. Only two of the women showed \na preference for distant role models. Whilst five \nwomen had mixed-sex role model sets, one woman \nhad only male role models, whilst four others had \nonly female role models. When reviewing the \nadequacy of the role model sets in meeting their \ndevelopmental needs, several women noted the lack \nof senior women from their own organisation or their \nown business sector, and the lack of males or \n 6\n  \nfemales to provide a male or female perspective \nrespectively. \n\u201cAs for shortcomings, they are nearly all \nin the same line of work and therefore \noffer a narrower viewpoint than if they \nrepresented different functions. They \nare all women \u2013 funny, didn\u2019t realize \nthat until just now, interesting.\u201d \n \nTable I: The Role Model Sets and Domains \n SR BJ DK UY AY HM AS WJ SK FH \nNumber in set 2 9 3 7 5 3 3 6 8 4 \nFamily domain X XX XX XX X  X XX XX  \nFriends domain  XX X XXX XX  XX XX XXX  \nBusiness domain XX XXXX XX XXXX XXX XXX XX XXX XXX XXXX \nArts domain (Ballet, \nTheatre, TV, Music, \nFilm, Literature, Art, \nCraft) \n XX  X X X  X XXXX XXXX \nFictitious domain  X       X  \nRoyal domain     X      \nPolitical domain      X     \nFemale domain  XXX XX XXX \nXXX \nXXXXX XXX XX XXX XXXX\nXXXX \nXXXX \nMale domain XX XXX \nXXX \nX X   X XXX   \nNumber of \ndomains \n3 7 5 6 6 4 5 6 6 3 \nAll Female Set     X X   X X \nAll Male Set X          \nMixed-Sex Set  X X X   X X   \nClose\/Known XX XXXX \nXXX \nXXX XXXXX XXX  XXX XXXXX XXXX  \nDistant  XX  XX XX XXX  X XXXX XXXX \n \nTable II: Close\/Distant and Few\/Multiple Role Models  \n Close Role Models Distant Role Models  \nRole Model Set has Few \nDomains \n(from three domains) \nSR 2 FH     4 2 women \nRole Model Set has \nMultiple Domains \n(at least from 4 domains) \nBJ  7 \nUY  5 \nSK  4  \nWJ 5  \nAY  3 \nDK  3 \nAS  3 \nBJ     2 \nUY     2 \nSK     4 \nWJ     1 \nAY     2 \nHM     3 \n8 women \n 32 Close Role Models 18 Distant Role Models  \n \nLearning from the Role Models \nThe female interviewees were asked to \ncomment not just on their role models but on \nthe specific learning points from them. These \nfell into several categories. Many were about \npersonal characteristics and style, and several \nstereotypically masculine traits emerged, such \nas control and determination. However, for \nseveral of them, there was a view that it was \nacceptable to be feminine in style, their role \nmodels had done it successfully and they \nwanted to emulate that femininity in their own \ncareers. \n\u201cLearning from Madonna was that \nI can be carefree, feminine, \n 7\n  \nattractive, and still be strong and \ngo for things. She makes me \nadmire her for her \u201cI\u2019m a force to \nbe reckoned with\u201d attitude. Be \ncompetitive, don\u2019t give respect \njust for the sake of it, don\u2019t be \nsubservient. You don\u2019t have to \nconform, sexy dressing doesn\u2019t \nhave to mean loose morals.\u201d \nAnother set of learning revolved around life \nskills, particularly that the quality of life is \nimportant. Some of these women had seen city \n\u201csuperwomen\u201d and their demanding lives as \nsomething of a lesson for themselves. Whilst \nthey admired the women at the top, they \nrecognised that it came at a cost. For several \ninterviewees, despite their professional \ncareers, work\/life balance was important to \nthem, as was having a sense of fun at work.  \n\u201cJill Dando, the journalist and \npresenter. Because she was the \n\u2018local girl done good\u2019. She \nflourished into a beautiful woman \nwho was successful in her career \nbut didn\u2019t find love till late in life \u2013 I \nidentified with her in my \n\u2018singledom\u2019. She sent out a \nmessage that even with such \nbeauty and brains, love can \nsometimes evade you. More \nimportantly, she showed that \nanyone could achieve their goals, \nand should not be held back by \ntheir background.\u201d \nAs role models are used to develop \u201cideal \nselves\u201d for future career success, it is not \nsurprising that much of the learning was \nassociated with leadership. Some of this was \nrelated to managing tasks as leader, and came \nfrom watching much more senior people do \ntheir jobs well.  \nImportantly, there was a key kind of learning \nfrom watching their bosses managing and \ndeveloping people. Several of the women said \nthat they had learnt from observing negative as \nwell as positive role models. For example, two \nhad noticed the demotivating effects of leader \nmoodiness, and took special efforts to be seen \nin positive mood. One learnt from her very \nsuccessful father how to have respect for \neveryone, at whatever level, to deal with \npeople calmly and to be genuinely interested in \nthem. Two others commented on the way in \nwhich their male bosses had affirmed their \ncompetence, building their self-esteem and \nconfidence. They had then tried out to replicate \nthis with people junior to them, with successful \nresults that pleased them enormously. One \nsaid: \n\u201cI undertook a task for my boss, \nand he sent a memo to his boss \nsaying I had done it very well, \nwhich was super. And when I had \nto get the help of a junior person, I \ntried to be as supportive of \neverything she did, and I thought \nit would be nice for her to have \nthat sort of affirmation, and so I \nrepeated what my boss had done \nfor me, but of course this was a \nmuch lower level. And she was so \nthrilled that I had done that. And \nto see that working down, that \nwas a nice experience for me. It \nwas that feeling of understanding \nhow to deal with people that I \nlearnt, it was a bit managerial, \nhow to lead them and motivate \nthem.\u201d \nAnother important theme emerging from the \ninterviews was challenge, both in terms of their \nown need for challenge, and their \nunderstanding of how to give challenge to \nothers in a supportive and developmental way. \nOne respondent said that her director boss \nused to give her \u201ca thimbleful of an idea, and \ntell me to go away and run with it\u201d. All he was \ninterested in was that she delivered, but she \nfelt that he was in a way testing her and \ndeveloping her at the same time. She had to \nbe quick on the uptake, be willing to admit \nwhat she didn\u2019t know and take the necessary \naction with very little solid information to go on. \nThis learning was something that she now tried \nto provide for those in her team. Another said: \n\u201cOne of the things I picked up \nfrom him was to give someone a \ntask and have confidence in them, \ngive them the space in which to \ndo it, not to keep jumping down \ntheir throats every five minutes. \nAnd have people feel that if \nsomething goes wrong, they could \ngo and say, I\u2019ve done this wrong, \nand you\u2019ll say, right, we\u2019ll work \nthrough it, not blow your top. I can \nsee how that works.\u201d \nDISCUSSION \nThese findings provide more evidence that \nambitious young women tend to use a \nselection of role models in order to guide them \nthrough their careers and build appropriate \nidentities. They were not falling into the trap \n 8\n  \nidentified by Shapiro et al. (1978) of searching \nfor a single perfectly matched female role \nmodel. Six of them had males in their set too. \nNone of the women had a single or total role \nmodel, but they did not seem to have an \nidealised \u201ccomposite\u201d role model either, in the \nway suggested by Bucher and Stelling (1977). \nIt was more a sense of drawing on different \nrole models for different strengths, but not \nnecessarily building them together again into a \nreconstructed ideal self. However, the \nmetaphor of unfreezing, changing and \nrefreezing suggested by Ashforth (1998) was \nrelevant for the young women who reported \nthat they were at a cross-roads and reconciling \ntheir life plans and career plans, after drifting \nalong in their own comfort zones.  \n\u201cIt was very useful mapping out \nthe role models like this, because \nit made me think, why does it look \nlike this. Why is my mother not \nthere? She has her own career, \nshe is an artist. She is very strong \nin that, and I can\u2019t see why I \nwouldn\u2019t look at her as a role \nmodel in terms of my career \u2013 I \ndon\u2019t draw on her at all. When I \nthink about the shortcomings of \nthis map, I think it is because I am \nat this crossroads. Maybe I\u2019m too \nfocused on personalities, and not \nenough on goals and my career, \nwhich I think is quite a key thing \njust now.\u201d \nBut other women still often used their parents \nas reference points when uncertain what to do, \nconsidering what their parent would have done \nin similar circumstances.  \nThus, the set of partial role models emerged \nas the most common structure. However, as \ninterviewees had been asked to map out their \nrole model set graphically, this may have \ninfluenced the way in which they reported their \nuse of role models to the researcher.  \nJust as Lockwood and Kunda (1997) reported, \nsome \u2018superstars\u2019 were selected by these \nyoung women. This was unexpected. Perhaps \nso much is written about some of these \nfemales that young women actually know \nmuch more \u201cinformation\u201d about them from TV, \nmagazines and newspapers, whether true or \nnot, compared to their knowledge of the \nwomen business leaders, other than a few \nstars at the top who were written about in the \nfinancial pages. Role modelling is assumed to \ninclude social learning (Bandura, 1977) \ninvolving observing and emulating behaviours, \nstyles and attributes of role models. Whilst the \nchoice of celebrity role models might occur \nbecause they are frequently in the public gaze, \noffering glimpses of their behaviour, an \nalternative view can be offered which might \nextend the Higgins and Kram (2001) \nframework used in this paper. The Higgins and \nKram framework was adopted from mentoring \nthat, by definition, involves personal contact \nand offers opportunities for social learning. \nHowever, the notion of close and distant role \nmodels, implicit in discussion of role modelling, \nmay be a useful distinction to make and for \nwhich different psychological learning \nprocesses may be engaged. \nNear and distant has been a concept explored \nin the leadership literature, for example, \nShamir (1995). In that context, near and far \nleaders are ascribed different characteristics; \ndistant leaders are characterised by notions of \nhaving ideological missions, by courage, \npersistence in the face of difficulty, \ndetermination. Near leaders who are \nobservable and known personally are more \nlikely to be characterised in terms of openness, \nsociability and humour. The idea of charisma \nand other hard to copy characteristics are \nmore typical of the\u2019 ideal self\u2019 or aspects of self \nthat are difficult to identify with and access. \nThese are more often ascribed to distant \nleaders than near leaders.  \nThis may also be the case for role models and \nfurther studies could do well to explore near \nand distant aspects of role modelling. At a \ncrossroads in a career when new steps need \nto be taken, a person must find within their \npotential, aspects of themselves hitherto \nuntapped. Often these aspects of self have \nbeen unconscious, perhaps even unwanted in \nthe individual\u2019s life so far. For women, these \noften correspond to characteristics associated \nwith leaders but not necessarily with femininity. \nA positive identification with these aspects of \none\u2019s self is necessary to have the confidence \nto take the next step. For example, standing \none\u2019s ground and having a high profile on a \ncontentious issue is more probable if one\u2019s \nidentity includes being courageous and \npersistent. Yet women are often socialised into \nharmonious and yielding behaviours. Thus the \nassertive aspect is present but unconscious \nand unformed.  \nA distant role model is the ideal way of \naccessing these potentials. The process of \nsplitting and projection is involved (derived \nfrom Object Relations theory, see for example \nKlein\u2019s 1959 seminal paper). In this process, \n 9\n  \naspects of oneself that are unconscious or \ndifficult to own are projected, as if like a \ncinematic projector, onto suitable others. The \nperson onto whom the projection is made is \nthen seen to possess these difficult aspects \n(which may be viewed by other people as very \npositive characteristics) and the projector does \nnot have to deal with them as part of their own \npersonality. However, successfully re-\nintegrating these projections enables the \nperson to consciously own and identify them \nas part of their personality. A celebrity who has \nsome superficial similarity to the aspects of self \nthat are required in a future role is an ideal \nprojective screen. Although a person may \nimagine knowing a lot about a celebrity, in \nreality anything can be projected onto their \npersona. So Madonna may be seen as \ncourageous and stands her ground, yet we \nknow little of how she actually does or does \nnot do this in her personal life. The idea of \nMadonna can be used to incorporate \ncourageous attributes that lie dormant in the \nperson who sees her as a role model into a \nnew set of desired behaviours. In identifying \nwith her as a role model, the young woman \ncan integrate courage and assertiveness into \nher own identity and own them as positive \naspects of herself because the celebrity is \nlauded and has the approval of a significant \npart of society. This may be particularly \nimportant for those characteristics, for \nexample, increasing independence of opinion, \nor taking conflict head on, which women might \nfear could meet with disapproval in their own \ncase. \nHence, the use of distant role models may \nhave less to do with social learning and more \nto do with individuation and psychological \ngrowth. Gibson (2003) found stage one career \ninvolved near role models, whilst in later \nstages, the issues were to do with role models \naffirming the user\u2019s self-concept. Superstars \nand celebrities are ideal for this, and mentoring \nand coaching could incorporate an \nunderstanding of this process to support \nmentees and coachees in re-integrating and \nowning these projections.  Exploring who the \ndistant role models are for the individual, and \nwhy, would be a helpful part of this work.  \nWork-life balance came up in only two \ninterviews, but the issue of combining career \nand future motherhood was mentioned by six \nwomen. Perhaps the former finding was \nbecause balance at present was not difficult to \nattain, as none of the women had children.  A \nstrong need emerged from four of the women \nfor expression of their more artistic sides, \nwhich was being suppressed in busy jobs. \nThese included painting, literature, theatre, \ndance and music, and again may help explain \nwhy role models were sought from such \ndomains. The notion of what is being \nsuppressed and the choice of role model to \naccess the suppressed side of one\u2019s self \nsupports the idea that distant role models may \nassist through their potential use as a \nprojective screen. \nThere is an important issue concerning the few \nbusinesswomen identified as role models, if \nthis is a general issue for women in this age \ngroup in early professional careers. The \nconsequences of lack of business role models \nare serious for women, who do not see career \npossibilities as clearly as they would wish. \nThey may scale down their ambition, their \npotential is under-developed, and often they \nstagnate or leave to find rewards elsewhere. \nThere is also a problem for organisations \nwithout female role models, as indicated by \nSheppard (1989). Their female managers have \nto spend additional time and effort ascertaining \nhow to behave and present themselves at \nwork, with little support available at senior \nlevels from colleagues or peers who are similar \nby gender. Sexualisation and objectivisation of \nwomen at work are often used as instruments \nof power by male colleagues, as a way of \ncontrolling competition for scarce promotions. \nThere are particular problems associated with \nwomen going on maternity leave and returning \nto positions of responsibility, where few or \neven no women have successfully operated \nafter becoming mothers. There is often \ninappropriate behaviour from males, both \nindividually and as groups, because they are \nnot used to dealing with managerial women. \nWithout female role models, women turn to \ndesexualisation of themselves at work as a \ncoping strategy. They constrain their feminine \nside in case it is seen as stereotypically \nunprofessional or as attractive and hence \ninviting of male sexual attention. Leadership \nand management styles therefore continue to \nbe masculine as the feminine is not expressed \nand is undervalued by both males and females \n(Schein and Mueller, 1992). \nCONCLUSIONS \nThis small, exploratory study brings empirical \nevidence of the role modelling process as \nexperienced by young female professionals, in \na field that has been somewhat neglected for \nnearly a decade, apart from Gibson (2003; \n2004). Building also on earlier work by Shapiro \net al.(1978) and Bucher and Stelling (1977), \n 10\n  \nthe paper contributes an understanding of how \nwomen seeking business career advancement \nuse role models in a variety of domains for \ndifferent purposes to guide their own \ndevelopment, rather than seeking a single \nideal type match with themselves. In addition, \nthe paper indicates that women draw on more \nrole models from the business world, but do \nnot include many very senior business women. \nMost of the sample had multiple role models, \nand preferred close or near role models to \nthose more distant and not personally known \nto the user.  \nWe acknowledge the limitations of this \nresearch in terms of the small sample, whose \ncareer awareness had been raised by the \nrecent career seminar. Further research is \nsuggested using a larger sample, across \ngenders to see how much commonality there \nis between young professionals. It would also \nbe useful to study the way in which role \nmodels are used at the threshold of senior \nmanagement, usually the glass ceiling in most \norganisations. It is anticipated that a much \nmore business-focused approach would be \nused to identify the role models, and that the \nlearning at this more senior levels would be \nmore focused on developing appropriate \nleadership behaviours. Given that so many \nwomen managers quote the lack of \nappropriate role models as a key barrier to \nadvancement, it is surely time for research \nstudies to measure the contributions made by \nrole models. \nREFERENCES \nAshforth, B.
