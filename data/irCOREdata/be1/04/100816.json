INTRODUCTION\nCollisions of composite nuclei involve a complicated\ninterplay and exchange of energy and angular momentum\nbetween the relative motion and the intrinsic states of the\nnuclei. High precision data for low-energy fusion reactions\nprovide one of the most sensitive tests of such interplay.\nStationary state coupled-channels descriptions have provided a\nnatural methodology to study the effects of specific excitation\nmodes of one or both of the reactants on the reaction\noutcomes. The wave function in this Schro\u00a8dinger coupled-\nchannels picture is a linear superposition of the states in\nthe model space with a definite phase relationship. This\ncoherent linear superposition can result in enhancement of\nthe quantum tunneling probability and quantum interference.\nThe coupled-channels approach has been very successful [1] in\nexplaining several collision observables. However, problems\nremain. Foremost is the inability to describe elastic scattering\nand fusion measurements simultaneously [2,3] and, related,\nthe more recent failure to describe in a physically consistent\nway the below-barrier quantum tunneling and above-barrier\nfusion yields [4].\nThe coupled-channels treatment of collisions of complex\nnuclei as closed quantum systems is an approximation. In\npractice, collisions evolve as open quantum systems, with\ninnumerable bound and continuum intrinsic excitations of\nthe nuclei. In analogy with problems of a quantum system\nin a bath, and following Bohr and Mottelson [5], we view\nthe nuclear many-body Hamiltonian as a sum of collective,\nsingle-particle, and coupling terms. In a nuclear collision, the\ncollective part comprises the relative motion of the nuclei\nand intrinsic rotational and\/or vibrational modes. Only a\nfraction of the Hilbert space of this Hamiltonian is used\nin any feasible full coupled-channels calculation. This is\nbecause the model space is inevitably restricted to selected,\nmost collective intrinsic excitations. These collective states\ndefine a reduced quantum system. All other states are weakly\ncoupled to this reduced system by residual interactions and\nconstitute an \u201cenvironment.\u201d The key question that arises\nis: do environmental effects influence the reaction dynamics\nand observables, such as angular distributions of products or\ntunneling rates?\nIn modeling fusion, the environment is assumed to come\ninto play only inside the fusion barrier and is accounted\nfor in coupled-channels calculations through an imaginary\npotential or an ingoing wave boundary condition. However,\nenvironmental effects can also be manifested before the nuclei\nencounter the fusion barrier, for example, as real or virtual\nexcitations of giant resonances in the individual nuclei by\nthe long-range Coulomb excitation mechanism. These can be\nimportant doorway states to the irreversible loss of kinetic\nenergy (heating of the nuclei), as first suggested in Ref. [6] for\ndeep-inelastic reactions. Another mechanism is complicated\nmultinucleon transfer channels [7]. Measurements have shown\nthat deep-inelastic processes occur even at subbarrier incident\nenergies [8], in competition with the process of quantum\ntunneling, and thus fusion [9]. Energy loss associated with the\ndeep-inelastic mechanism thus could play a significant role in\nthe inhibition of tunneling at deep subbarrier energies.\nThe investigation of the effect, on near- and below-barrier\nfusion, here requires a dynamical model that can include both\nintrinsic state and environmental couplings in calculations\nof the tunneling probability. There are no existing realistic\ntheoretical approaches for solving this problem. Within a\nmodel context, this article (1) discusses how environment-\ninduced irreversibility can be incorporated into the successful\ncoupled-channels framework and (2) makes a first assessment\nof its effect on a low-energy nuclear collision. The application\nconsidered is quantum tunneling, relevant to the low-energy\nnuclear fusion hindrance phenomenon.\n0556-2813\/2008\/78(6)\/064604(6) 064604-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nA. DIAZ-TORRES et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 78, 064604 (2008)\nThe article is organized as follows. In Sec. II we give a\nbrief survey of theoretical approaches to dissipative dynamics\nof low-energy nuclear collisions and discuss the suitability\nof the Lindblad axiomatic theory for the treatment of energy\ndissipation on subbarrier fusion. In Sec. III we present the\ncoupled-channels density matrix approach. Numerical results\nfor our model test case are discussed in Sec. IV. Finally, the\nsummary of the article is given in Sec. V.\nII. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nNeither existing models of fusion nor of deep-inelastic\nscattering can address both energy dissipation and quantum\ntunneling. The impact of finite lifetimes of excited states\n(e.g., giant resonances) on fusion has been studied within a\ncoupled-channels model [10\u201312], but this approach does not\nlead to energy dissipation. Direct damped collisions between\ncomplex nuclei have also been intensively investigated within\nvarious approaches, including (i) transport theories [13] based\non premaster, master, Fokker-Planck, Langevin, and diffusion\nequations and (ii) quantum mechanical collective theories\n[14]. An appealing semiclassical coupled-channels approach\ncombined with a random-matrix model has been suggested by\nKo [15], which unifies the statistical and coherent pictures of\nenergy dissipation in deep-inelastic collisions. This framework\nhas been successfully applied [16,17] to study the excitation\nof multiphonon giant resonances in heavy-ion collisions at\nintermediate energy. In most of these developments the relative\nmotion of the nuclei is described with classical trajectories,\nwhile the coupling to intrinsic degrees of freedom is treated\neither statistically (random-matrix theory) or through phe-\nnomenological transport coefficients. However, the quantum\nmechanical treatment of the relative motion is essential for\ndealing with quantum tunneling.\nThe quantum dynamical model presented in this work is\nbased on the time evolution of a reduced density matrix.\nIt provides a consistent description of the transition from\na pure state to a mixed quantum state during the collision.\nThe fundamental equation of motion is the Liouville-von\nNeumann equation for an open quantum system, in which\na dissipative Liouvillian accounts for irreversibility due to\ninteractions of the system with an environment. The Lindblad\naxiomatic approach [18,19] for open quantum systems has\nbeen successfully applied in nuclear physics, but within\nrather schematic models. For instance, to describe the charge\nequilibration process in deep-inelastic collisions [20], fission\n[21], decay of giant resonances [22], tunneling through a\nparabolic barrier [23], and scattering in a two-dimensional\ninverse parabolic potential [24]. These are calculations for a\nsingle channel of either one damped oscillator [21\u201323] or two\ncoupled damped oscillators [20,24].\nIn low-energy nuclear collisions, the context of the present\napplication, Lindblad\u2019s dynamics for the evolution of the\nreduced system is justified (i) because the coupling to the\ncomplex environment (through excited doorway states and de-\ntermined by residual interactions) is weak and (ii) because the\nMarkov approximation is expected to be valid, the collective\nmotions of the two nuclei being slower than the rearrangement\nof the environmental (nucleonic) degrees of freedom. With\nincreasing collision energy, to well above the Coulomb barrier,\nmemory effects related to diabatic dynamics [25\u201327] may be\nimportant and a non-Markovian Liouvillian may be required.\nThe weak coupling between two subspaces of the total space of\nintrinsic nuclear states distinguishes between the system and\nthe environment. The Lindblad theory does not require [28] any\nlimitation on the strength of the system-environment coupling,\nalthough the definition of physically well-defined environment\nstates would require a careful analysis in the strong-coupling\nlimit.\nAn essential effect of the environment on the reaction\ndynamics (unlike the effect of absorptive terms) is to pro-\ngressively destroy the coherent linear superposition and the\nassociated phase relationships between different channels,\nintroducing quantum decoherence in the system.\nHere, we identify two such (model) sources of decoherence\nand dissipation. First, an environment inside the Coulomb\nbarrier, which is related to the complexity of compound\nnucleus states. Second, one with effectively a long range,\nassociated with decay out of short-lived (compared to the\nreaction time) internal vibrational states, e.g., the giant dipole\nresonance (GDR) of the colliding nuclei, will be shown to be\nof particular importance. The damping of the GDR, because of\nits irreversible coupling to a sea of complicated surrounding\nstates, which constitute the environment [29], destroys the\ncoherent dynamical coupling with the relative motion of the\nnuclei. Here we show that damping of the GDR results in\ndecoherence and energy loss in the region where the nuclei\noverlap, inhibiting tunneling and thus fusion.\nIII. COUPLED-CHANNELS DENSITY MATRIX\nAPPROACH\nWe exploit the time evolution of a coupled-channels density\nmatrix, as is employed in quantum molecular dynamics [30].\nThe density operator \u03c1\u02c6 in Eq. (1) is represented in an\nasymptotic (product) basis of states of the internal Hamiltonian\nof the individual nuclei, |i\u3009, i = 1, . . . , N (lower indices), and\ncoordinate states describing the separation of the two nuclei,\n|r), r = 1, . . . ,M (upper indices). That is,\n\u03c1\u02c6 =\n\u2211\nij,rs\n|r)|i\u3009\u03c1rsij \u3008j |(s|. (1)\nCrucially, we also add two auxiliary states to the |i\u3009 basis that\nallow distinct environmental interactions, as described below.\nThe density operator obeys the time-dependent Liouville-von\nNeumann equation\n\u2202\u03c1\u02c6\n\u2202t\n= \u02c6L\u03c1\u02c6 = [ \u02c6LH + \u02c6LD]\u03c1\u02c6, (2)\nwhere the total Liouvillian consists of a Hamiltonian part\n\u02c6LH \u03c1\u02c6 = \u2212i[ \u02c6H, \u03c1\u02c6]\/h\u00af describing the coherent evolution of\nthe system with Hamiltonian \u02c6H and a dissipative part \u02c6LD\naccounting for the interactions with the environment. Here, \u02c6LD\nis assumed to be given by Lindblad\u2019s dissipative Liouvillian\n064604-2\nDISSIPATIVE QUANTUM DYNAMICS IN LOW-ENERGY . . .

Here each \u02c6C\u03b1 is\na Lindblad operator for a dissipative coupling, physically\nmotivated according to the specific problem. We assume\nthat each coupling \u03b1 \u2261 (Ij ) between a given state |j \u3009 and\nan environmental state |I \u3009 has an associated rate \u0004Ij , i.e,\n\u02c6CIj =\n\u221a\n\u0004Ij |I \u3009\u3008j | [31], determined by the inverse lifetime of\nthe excited states and the branching ratio of its deexcitation,\ntaken to be that when the nuclei are well separated. We\nnote also that (a) the Lindblad Liouvillian has been derived\nusing microscopic models [22,32] and (b), in contrast to many\n(dissipative) model Liouvillians [19], Eq. (3) preserves both\nthe positivity and the trace of the density matrix. These are\nessential properties in any realistic application.\nIn the model calculations that follow, the basis comprises\ntwo asymptotic states (coupled-channels) |1\u3009 and |2\u3009 with\nchannel energies ej . Channel |1\u3009 is the (ground states) entrance\nchannel and is coupled to an inelastic state |2\u3009 by a coupling\ninteraction V12. Two distinct sources of irreversibility are also\nconsidered, modeled by two auxiliary (environment) states |X\u3009\nand |Y \u3009. The first environmental coupling describes capture\nby the potential pocket inside the fusion barrier. This simulates\nthe irreversible and dissipative excitations associated with\nthe evolution from the two separate nuclei to a compound\nnuclear system. In a stationary states approach this loss of\nflux is approximated by imposing an imaginary potential\n\u2212iW (r),W (r) > 0, or an ingoing wave boundary condition\nat distances well inside the barrier. Here, these transitions\nare described by an auxiliary state |X\u3009, to which all other\nstates |j \u3009 couple, modeled [33] by a Lindblad operator,\n\u02c6CXj = \u221a\u03b3 rr |X\u3009\u3008j |. The absorption rate to state |X\u3009 is given by\n\u03b3 rr = W (r)\/h\u00af, where W (r) is taken as a Fermi function with\ndepth 10 MeV and diffuseness 0.1 fm, located at the pocket\nradius of the nucleus-nucleus potential, \u22487 fm. This choice\nguarantees complete absorption inside the pocket. The fusion\nprobability is defined as the probability accumulating in this\nstate |X\u3009.\nThe second environment, whose explicit treatment will be\nseen to be the most significant at lower energies, is associated\nwith the irreversible decay out of intrinsic excitations of\nthe colliding nuclei. Such decays are independent of the\ndynamical couplings. Specifically, we associate the ONLY\nexcited coupled-channel state |2\u3009 with the GDR excitation.\nWe then introduce a second auxiliary state |Y \u3009, representing\nthe bath of states in which the GDR is embedded and to which\nonly the GDR excitation |2\u3009 is coupled.\nThus, |Y \u3009 and\/or |X\u3009 supplement the two intrinsic states |1\u3009\nand |2\u3009 that compose the two coupled channels. Both of the\nauxiliary states refer to complex excitation modes of the nuclei,\nassociated with nucleonic degrees of freedom and compound\nnucleus states, respectively. They provide intuitive and formal\nchannels [33] for describing irreversible coupling and loss of\nprobability from the system to these environments, couplings\nthat enter only through the dissipative dynamics term \u02c6LD in\nEq. (2). |Y \u3009 is also assumed to couple to |X\u3009 at the appropriate\nFIG. 1.

Probability accumulating in state |Y \u3009\noutside of this |X\u3009 pocket may be identified with deep-inelastic\nprocesses, as is discussed later. These environments and the\ncouplings present in the model calculations are represented\nschematically in Fig. 1.

[34]). In that approach, decoherence and\ndissipation originate from the introduction of random quantum\njumps in the time evolution of the wave function of the system.\nThis unraveling density matrix evolution, through stochastic\nwave function methods [34], shows that the two approaches\nare equivalent and the former takes into account the role of\n064604-3\nA. DIAZ-TORRES et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 78, 064604 (2008)\nfluctuations in the calculation of the expectation values and\nvariances of observables.\nThe present calculational scheme is based on Eqs. (5)\nand (6) and proceeds as follows. Initially, at time t = 0, the\nnuclei are well separated in their ground states, and their\ndensity matrix describes a pure state with Tr[\u03c1\u02c6] = Tr[\u03c1\u02c62] =\n1. An initial wave-packet describes the relative motion of\nthe nuclei. The coupled equations are solved numerically\nusing the Faber polynomial expansion of the time evolution\nsuperoperator [35], exp(\u03c4 \u02c6L), and the Fourier method of\nRef. [36] for the commutator between the kinetic energy and\ndensity operator. Having solved for the dynamical evolution of\nthe density matrix, expectation values of an observable \u02c6O are\nnow obtained from the trace relation \u3008 \u02c6O(t)\u3009 = Tr[ \u02c6O\u03c1\u02c6(t)]. The\npurity of the initial state, conserved under Hamiltonian unitary\nevolution, will be destroyed (Tr[\u03c1\u02c62] < 1) if the environment\ncauses a loss of quantum coherence. This decoherence can\nthus be quantified via this loss of density matrix purity, or\nequivalently by an increase of the linear entropy 1 \u2212 Tr[\u03c1\u02c62].\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSo as to make contact with the coherent Schro\u00a8dinger\npicture, the model Hamiltonian we used was chosen to coincide\nwith that of the coupled-channels fusion model CCFULL [37].\nSpecifically, our model calculations use physical parameters\nrelevant to the 16O + 144Sm reaction at collision energies\nbelow its nominal fusion barrier, VB = 61.1 MeV. We assume\nzero relative orbital angular momentum between the reactants.\nThe form of the bare nuclear potential between the two nuclei,\nconsistent with the stated VB , is a Woods-Saxon potential with\n(V0, r0, a0) \u2261 (\u2212105.1 MeV, 1.1 fm, 0.75 fm). The Coulomb\npotential was that for two point charges. The 16O projectile\nwas taken to be inert and the 144Sm target was allowed to\nbe excited to a GDR vibrational state. The dynamical nuclear\ncoupling of the ground state |1\u3009 to the vibrational state |2\u3009,\nwith excitation energy E1\u2212 = 15 MeV, has a macroscopic\ndeformed Woods-Saxon form with a deformation parameter of\n\u03b21 = 0.2.\nThe time step for the density matrix propagation was\n\tt = 10\u221222 s, and the radial grid (r = 0\u2013250 fm) was evenly\nspaced with M = 512 points. The relative motion of the two\nnuclei in the entrance channel |1\u3009 was described by a minimal-\nuncertainty Gaussian wave packet, with width \u03c30 = 20 fm,\nTABLE I.

The numerical accuracy\nof the time evolution was checked using a fully coherent,\ntime-dependent calculation, excluding coupling to states |X\u3009\nand |Y \u3009. It was confirmed that the normalization and purity of\nthe density matrix, Tr[\u03c1\u02c6] = Tr[\u03c1\u02c62] = 1, and the expectation\nvalue of the system energy Tr[ \u02c6H\u03c1\u02c6] were maintained with high\naccuracy over the required number of time steps, typically 700\nfor the full duration of the collision.\nThe importance of the two, spatially distinct, sources of\nenvironment couplings was studied. Calculations were first\nperformed in the scheme shown in the left panel of Fig. 1.\nHere the intrinsic coupled channels |1\u3009 and |2\u3009 also couple\nto the capture state |X\u3009.

The P (E0),\nshown as a function of E0\/VB in Fig. 2(a), are in very\ngood agreement showing the appropriateness of stationary\nstate coupled-channels calculations for this observable within\nthe dynamical scheme of states |1\u3009, |2\u3009, and |X\u3009. It is our\ncontention that the dissipation associated with state |X\u3009, while\nsignificant at 60 MeV, is strongly localized inside the barrier\nand thus does not impact upon the barrier penetrability. We\nwill now show that the same is not true for the more spatially\nextended dissipation due to the GDR decay environment |Y \u3009.\nThe treatment of the irreversible GDR decay (with a\nspreading width of 6 MeV) to the bath of surrounding complex\nstates (represented by |Y \u3009) was included by switching on the\ncoupling of the intrinsic inelastic state |2\u3009 to |Y \u3009. This is\nthe dynamical scheme of the right-hand panel in Fig. 1.\nUnlike the coupling to |X\u3009, a major part of the inelastic\nexcitation of the system gives access to |Y \u3009 before the wave\npacket encounters the fusion barrier. The onset of decoherence,\nthe purity of the density matrix, and the associated energy\ndissipation are shown in the right-hand entries in Table I and,\nas a function of time evolution, in Fig. 2(b), the latter for\nE0 = 45 MeV.\nSumming over all internal states of the density matrix\ngives the total diagonal elements in coordinate space, which\nrepresent the wave packet at a given time. Snapshots of the\nwave packet in the interaction region (for E0 = 45 MeV)\nare shown in Fig. 3. The curves are shown for times t = 0\n(dashed, the initial state), 400 \u00d7 10\u221222 s (dotted, near to the\ntime of closest approach), and 700 \u00d7 10\u221222 s (thin solid, post\nthe collision). Figure 3 shows the results from (a) the coupling\nto state |X\u3009 and (b) to both |X\u3009 and |Y \u3009. When the wave\npacket tunnels into the pocket (from dashed to dotted lines),\nthe short-range coupling to |X\u3009 leads to trapping of flux from\n|1\u3009 and |2\u3009 inside the potential pocket. This reveals itself as\nan unchanging probability for radii r < 7.5 fm as the main\nbody of the wave packet leaves the interaction region (from\nthe dotted to the thin solid lines) in Fig. 3(a). The additional\neffect of turning on the coupling between states |2\u3009 and |Y \u3009 is\nto trap probability under the barrier, as is shown in Fig. 3(b).\nThis reduces the component of the wave packet that reaches\nthe potential pocket, inhibiting the quantum tunneling.\nThe probability trapped under the fusion barrier is associ-\nated with GDR collective vibrational energy being irreversibly\nremoved from the coherent dynamics into innumerable chan-\nnels (heat). This is then no longer available for relative\nmotion, or tunneling. Such energy loss can be correlated with\ndeep-inelastic processes, seen experimentally, that compete\nwith fusion in reactions involving heavy nuclei [8].\nFigure 4(a) shows the time evolution of the probability\ntrapped in the potential pocket, state |X\u3009, for E0 = 45 MeV.\nWe comment that, when including the inelastic channel |2\u3009\nbut not |Y \u3009, the nucleus-nucleus potential renormalization\nleads to the expected enhanced penetrability from the inelastic\nchannel coupling, compared to the purely elastic (|1\u3009 plus |X\u3009)\ncalculation. The decoherent dynamics due only to environment\n|X\u3009 gives the (full curve).

Additional irreversible processes other than excitation of\nthe GDR are also likely to contribute to the deep-inelastic yield,\nsuch as complicated multinucleon transfers [7]. To simulate\nthese very simply, the assumed state |1\u3009 to |2\u3009 coupling\nstrength was increased. Figure 4(b) shows the dependence\nof the calculated tunneling suppression on the assumed \u03b21\nstrength for E0 = 45 (dashed curve) and 55 MeV (solid curve),\nwhere we note that larger \u03b21 values result in both an increase\nin the strength and the range of the coupling form factor to the\ninelastic state |2\u3009.\nV. SUMMARY\nA quantum dynamical model based on time propagation\nof a coupled-channels density matrix has been presented and\nis shown to describe the transition from pure state (coherent)\nto mixed state (decoherent and dissipative) dynamics during\na nuclear collision. The calculations exhibit both decoherence\nand energy dissipation and so go beyond coherent coupled-\nchannels approaches. Decoherence, originating here from\nthe irreversible decay of a giant-dipole vibrational state of\nthe heavy target nucleus to surrounding states, is shown to\nresult in hindrance of quantum tunneling. Developments of\nthe model calculations to include (a) nonzero relative orbital\nangular momenta between the reactants, (b) additional intrinsic\nchannels, and (c) a more detailed consideration of other\nprocesses, such as multinucleon or cluster transfer reactions,\nare necessary to confront experimental measurements.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank J.
