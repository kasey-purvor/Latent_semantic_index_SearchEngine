Stimuli were 14 color and grayscale pictures of \nfamous abstract and realist paintings (for example: Starry Night by Vincent Van \nGogh; Yellow, Red and Blue by Wassily Kandinsky; Sunrise by Claude Monet; Le \nJardin de Monet; Les Iris, by Claude Monet) cropped and re-sized to be equal in \nterms of overall shape and size. The sequence of blocks within a given run was \norganized quasi-randomly such that every block category was separated from the \nfollowing block category by a 14 s fixation period (which was then used as the \nbaseline condition). In each block, stimuli were presented for 800ms and separated by \na 200ms-duration blank white screen. Each block consisted of 13 unique stimuli. \nBecause we asked participants to perform a one-back task, one of the stimuli in each \nblock was randomly repeated.  \nEach subject undertook 2 runs of localizer tasks (either at the beginning or at \nthe end of the scanning session) which were organized into 18 blocks of experimental \nstimuli and 10 blocks of fixation, all lasting 14 s, for a total duration of 6:32 minutes. \nDuring the fixation period a 0.54\u00b0 x 0.54\u00b0 black cross was presented on a white \nbackground. \nStimuli were presented in the center of the screen and measured 15x8 cm at a \nviewing distance of 60cm. Participants were instructed to look at the fixation point \nduring the baseline period, but to move their eyes freely if they so desired when the \nexperimental stimuli were presented. They were also asked to perform a one-back \ntask by pressing a button with the right index finger.  \nData collection (imaging parameters and set-up) and analysis (pre-processing, \n3D alignment and statistics) were similar to Experiment 2. Unlike Experiment 2, the \nGLM model included 2 experimental predictors (color and grayscale) and 6 motion \ncorrection predictors (x, y, z for translation and for rotation). Color areas were \nlocalized by comparing color versus grayscale pictures. Statistical activation maps for \naveraged data were set to reliable threshold levels using a false rate discovery of \np=0.001 (available in BrainVoyager QX) to verify that our regions of interest were \nunlikely to have arisen by chance as a consequence of multiple comparisons. As for \nthe single-subject imaging maps, significant activations were defined in each \nindividual by contrasting conditions (using separate study predictors in order to \nweight for the contribution of each run) at a threshold of p<0.001, uncorrected.  \n \nLocalizer task 2: stimulus, design and analyses \nWe used a block design experiment to localize category specific brain areas \nsuch as the fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA), in order \nto compare their locations with the activations found for shape, texture and color \nadaptations in Experiment 2. Stimuli were grayscale pictures of faces (front view, \nwith and without emotions), places (exterior\/interiors of houses and panoramic \nscenes), objects (both manipulable and non-manipulable objects), textures \n(resembling stones, bricks, fabric, grass, etc.), patterns (grids, gratings, mosaics, lines, \nspider nets, etc.) and scrambled version of these same pictures. It is important to \nunderline that the set of texture stimuli used in the localizer were 2D pictures of the \nsurface material of real objects and therefore differed from the stimuli used in the \nmain experiments, particularly in that the latter did include variations in pigmentation. \nStimuli were organized into six blocks accordingly to their category (face, place, \nobject, texture, pattern and scrambled). The sequence of blocks within a given run \nwas organized quasi-randomly such that every block category was accompanied by its \nscrambled version and was separated by the following block category by a 14 s \nfixation period (which was then used as the baseline condition). In each block, stimuli \nwere presented for 800ms and separated by a 200ms-duration blank white screen. \nEach block consisted of 13 unique stimuli. Because we asked participants to perform \na one-back task, one of the stimuli in each block was randomly repeated.  \nEach subject undertook 2 runs of localizer tasks (either at the beginning or at \nthe end of the scanning session) which were organized into 18 blocks of experimental \nstimuli and 10 blocks of fixation, all lasting 14 s, for a total duration of 6:32 minutes. \nDuring the fixation period a 0.54\u00b0 x 0.54\u00b0 black cross was presented on a white \nbackground. \nStimuli were presented in the center of the screen and measured 6x6 cm at a \nviewing distance of 60cm. Participants were instructed to look at the fixation point \nduring the baseline period, but to move their eyes freely if they so desired when the \nexperimental stimuli were presented. They were also asked to perform a one-back \ntask by pressing a button with the right index finger.  \nData collection (imaging parameters and set-up) and analysis (pre-processing, \n3D alignment and statistics) were similar to Experiment 2. Unlike Experiment 2, the \nGLM model included six experimental predictors (face, place, object, texture, pattern \nand scrambled) and 6 motion correction predictors (x, y, z for translation and for \nrotation). Face, place, and object areas were localized by comparing face versus place, \nplace versus face, and object versus scrambled objects respectively. Statistical \nactivation maps for averaged data were set to reliable threshold levels using a false \ndiscovery rate of p=0.001 (available in BrainVoyager QX) to verify that our regions \nof interest were unlikely to have arisen by chance as a consequence of multiple \ncomparisons. As for the single-subject imaging maps, significant activations were \ndefined in each individual by contrasting conditions (using separate study predictors \nin order to weight for the contribution of each run) at a threshold of p<0.001, \nuncorrected.  \nTable 3 supplementary materials:  \nLO=Lateral occipital; pIPS=posterior intraparietal sulcus; pCoS=posterior collateral \nsulcus; aCoS=anterior collateral sulcus; LG=lingual gyrus; FG=fusiform gyrus; \nDPLC=dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; mIPS= medial intraparietal sulcus; \npreSMA=pre-supplementary motor area; a=anterior; p=posterior.

Significant activations were defined in each participant by \ncontrasting conditions (using separate study predictors in order to weight for the \ncontribution of each run) at a minimum threshold of p<0.0001, uncorrected. SC \nvoxels were localized near the lateral occipital cortex (LO) using the following \nconjunction contrast: [(SC>NC)&(SC>TC)&(SC>CC)]. TC voxels were localized at \nthe posterior end of the CoS using the following conjunction contrast: \n[(TC>NC)&(TC>SC)&(TC>CC)].

Bars represent standard error. For abbreviations, please see \nFigure 5. \n \n  \n  \nFigure 9 supplementary materials: Overlay activity for Experiment 2 and \nindependent Localizer 2. \nOverlay activity for shape, texture and color areas active in Experiment 2, and face, \nplace and object activations in the independent Localizer 2 are shown for DF, MS and \nthe control group average. Rebound from adaptation for shape change trials \n[(SC>NC)&(SC>TC)&(SC>CC)] are depicted in red, for texture change trials \n[(TC>NC)&(TC>SC)&(TC>CC)] in blue, and for color change trials \n[(CC>NC)&(CC>TC)&(CC>SC)] in green. Activations for faces versus places are \ndepicted in pink, for places versus faces in dark brown and for object versus \nscrambled in plain and dotted orange. As before, the group activation map is based on \nthe Talairach averaged group results, shown for clarity on a single subject\u2019s \nanatomical scan. Face-selective voxels were localized within FFA (in neurologically \nintact controls and in DF) and within OFA (in controls only). Place-selective voxels \nwere localized within PPA and more caudally within the lingual gyrus (pLG) (Epstein \net al., 2007) in both neurological intact controls and in patient DF. Object selective \nvoxels were localized within the more dorsolateral portion of the lateral occipital \ncomplex (LO, in both MS and in neurological intact controls), and in the more ventral \nportion of the lateral occipital complex (posterior fusiform sulcus, pFs, in the \nneurological intact controls only). Object versus scrambled activation encompassed \nFFA, OFA, PPA, LO and the more anterior portion of the color area in the aCoS, \nexcluding color voxels in the LG and texture activation in the pCoS. This pattern of \nresults might be related to the fact that the pictures of objects we used in the localizer \nwere simple gray scale representation, and therefore did not signal the material \nproperties of objects through both color and texture. L=left, R=right, a=anterior, \np=posterior, LO=lateral occipital cortex, FFA=fusiform face area, \nPPA=parahippocampal place area, pLG=posterior lingual gyrus; aCoS=anterior \ncollateral sulcus, pCoS=posterior collateral sulcus.
