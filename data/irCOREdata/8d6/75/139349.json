An increasing number of 4\nreviews (Fan, 2008; Homola, 2008; Visser, 2008; Jason-Moller, 2006; Pattnaik, 2005), and 5\nbooks (Schasfoort and Tudos, 2008; Homola, 2006) dealing with the fundamentals and 6\napplications of SPR-based sensing have been published over the last decade. One of the most7\nimportant advances in the field is the SPR imaging (SPRi), also called \u201cSPR microscopy\u201d, 8\nwhich couples the sensitivity of scanning angle SPR measurements with the spatial capabilities 9\nof imaging. SPRi represents a promising and highly versatile affinity sensing platform suitable 10\nfor an array format. SPRi has been reported for a variety of affinity systems, including 11\nDNA\/DNA (Hayashi 2008; Piliarik, 2008; Lecaruyer 2006; Nelson, 2001), 12\nRNA\/DNA (Li 2006; Nelson, 2002), DNA-binding protein (Jeong 2008; 13\nBouffartigues 2007; Wegner 2003), RNA aptamers\/protein (Garcia 2008; Li 14\n2007; Li 2006), antibody-antigen (Ladd 2008; Liu 2008; Rebe Raz 15\n2008; Wong 2008; Yuk 2006) and carbohydrate\/protein (Grant ., 2008; 16\nMercey , 2008; Wakao ., 2008; Smith ., 2003). SPRi technology enables affinity 17\ninteractions to be monitored in real-time and without the use of any label, as in classical SPR 18\nsensing, but by using a CCD camera for signal detection both sensorgrams ( resonance signal 19\n. time) and images of the chip can be recorded allowing simultaneous analysis of many 20\ninteractions (up to hundreds).21\n22\nThis review describes SPRi technology and its applications. Commercially available SPRi 23\ninstrumentation is included with a focus on some key technical features such as the fluidic 24\nPage 10 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nsystem, temperature control, cell and biochip design. Attention is also given to surface chemistry 1\nfor biochip functionalisation and suitable approaches to improve sensitivity. 2\n3\nTraditional SPR cf. imaging SPR: features and breakthroughs 4\nSPR transduction belongs to the class of refractometric sensing devices, which use evanescent 5\nwaves to investigate surface phenomena. Changes in refractive index at the sensing surfaces due 6\nto analyte binding influence the resonant angle and this shift is used to generate a real-time 7\nsignal. Thus labelling is not required. Commercial SPR instruments are available from numerous 8\nsuppliers (Homola, 2008), the most frequently reported being the Biacore\u2122 system (GE 9\nHealthcare). SPR platforms can be classified according to three modulation approaches: angular, 10\nwavelength and intensity (Homola, 2006).11\n12\nIn contrast to scanning angle SPR and scanning wavelength SPR (traditionally termed \u201cSPR 13\nspectroscopy\u201d), SPRi systems are generally based on intensity modulation, measuring the 14\nreflectivity of monochromatic incident p-polarised light at a fixed angle. The polariser permits 15\nmeasurements both with p-polarised and s-polarised light, but the latter is used only as reference 16\nsignal to improve the image contrast and to eliminate artefacts. In the majority of cases, SPRi 17\ninstruments use a high refractive index prism in the Kretschmann configuration (Kretschmann 18\nand Reather, 1968). An alternative is the use of grating couplers (Wassaf , 2006). The19\nsensing surface of the prism is coated with a thin metal layer (usually gold or silver, 20\napproximately 50 nm in thickness), on which surface plasmons (SPs) are excited by matching 21\nSPs and evanescent wave (EW) propagation constants. The resonance conditions depend on the 22\ncharacteristics of the prism, metal and dielectric medium. The best resonance conditions are23\nusually achieved by varying the incident angle of the light on prism. A charge coupled device24\n(CCD) camera collects the reflected light, allowing the visualisation of the whole biochip in real 25\nPage 11 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\ntime. If the sensor surface is divided into multiple sensing spots, , microstructured, the device 1\ncan be used as a multichannel sensor. 2\n3\nSPRi offers two main advances over conventional SPR: the ability to visualise the entire biochip 4\nsurface in real time and the chance to monitor up to hundreds of molecular interactions 5\ncontinuously and simultaneously in a multi-array format of molecular probes formed as circular 6\nor square spots. It is also possible to control the quality of the spotted array by viewing the 7\nsurface image to accurately select the measurement area. These Regions of Interest (ROIs) are 8\nselected, for example, according to shape, size, and quality of the spot to enhance experimental 9\nresults. Direct image control of the surface also helps identify and reduce the ubiquitous problem 10\nof non-specific binding by defining spots without receptors and spots on gold, to be used as 11\nnegative control surfaces (negative control ROIs). The ability to immobilise many receptors (up 12\nto hundreds) on the surface and to monitor the kinetic parameters of biospecific interactions 13\nsimultaneously in a real-time and label-free microarray format is a tantalising opportunity. Spots 14\n(currently from 50 \u0000Pm2 up to 1 cm2) can be created both manually or by automatic spotters.15\n16\nCharacteristics of SPR imaging instruments on the market 17\nMany in-house SPRi instruments have been described  (Ladd ., 2008; Ruemmele ., 18\n2008; Chinowsky , 2007; Lecaruyer , 2006), but a number of commercial SPRi 19\ninstruments have recently been launched on market by, for example, GWC Technologies 20\n(Madison, USA), IBIS Technologies B.V. (Hengelo, The Netherlands), Genoptics Bio 21\nInteractions (Orsay, France) and GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden).22\n23\nExcept for the BiacoreTM Flexchip (GE Healthcare), configured as a grating coupler sensor, the 24\nKretschmann configuration is adopted (Fig. 1a). The measurement is carried out by fixing a 25\nPage 12 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nsingle working angle that corresponds to the greatest plasmon curves slope of interest and 1\nrecording the analytical datum as the intensity variation of the reflected light at that angle for 2\neach ROI is detected (Fig. 1b). At the same time interactions are displayed as sensorgrams (Fig. 3\n1c). Only the IBIS iSPR instrument operates in scanning angle mode; it directly records the so-4\ncalled \u201cSPR dip\u201d angle shifts linked to analyte binding. The main difference between these two 5\noptical assets relies on the dynamic range of the recorded variable (angle shift or reflectivity 6\nchange) refractive index change (and, consequently, mass density change). In particular, 7\nmeasurements conducted in fixed angle mode limit the linear relationship range between 8\nreflectivity and change in mass to the linear portion of the plasmon curve. This range 9\ncorresponds to approximately 5% variation of reflectivity and about 50 mdeg of the SPR dip 10\n(Nelson 2001).11\n12\nPerformance comparisons have been reported (Beusink 2008; Rebe Raz ., 2008; 13\nLokate 2007). Beusink, (2008), using the IBIS iSPR, developed a 24-spot biosensor 14\nby immobilising both a short peptide (2.4 kDa) and IgG (150 kDa), modified with biotin, to test 15\nthe dynamic range, limit of detection and standard deviation of the measurement of anti-biotin 16\nmouse IgG. The experiment was conducted in parallel with the SPRimager\u00aeII system (GWC 17\nTechnologies) and fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that IBIS iSPR angle scanning 18\nmode yielded a 10-fold larger dynamic range compared to the SPRimager\u00aeII system, allowing 19\nthe detection of molecules of very different molecular weight simultaneously immobilised on the 20\nsame sensor chip. 21\n22\n23\n24\nPage 13 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\nThe performance of a biosensor is strictly correlated with the control of the hydrodynamic 1\nconditions on the sensor surface and, consequently, the liquid handling system plays a crucial 2\nrole. Flow-through and cuvette systems are available. The first system presents the benefit of 3\nwell-defined hydrodynamic conditions during measurements without rebinding effects. 4\nMicrofluidic networks have attracted recent attention and studies to minimise diffusion problems 5\nand on analyte mass transport effects have appeared (Kanda ., 2004; D\u2019Agata ., 2008).6\nCuvette systems, allows multiple sample additions. Moreover the cuvette approach reduces 7\nsample volume require thus it is very suitable when low volumes are available and\/or in case of 8\nanalyte with low binding constants. Most of SPRi instruments offer both flow through and 9\ncuvette systems. 10\n11\nAnother key feature in all SPRi platforms is the flow cell. Early work by Berger (1998) 12\nreported one- and two-dimensional multichannel immunosensing using a homemade SPRi 13\nplatform equipped with a four-channel flow cell governed by a four-channel peristaltic pump. 14\nInitially, the cell was placed in contact with the biochip and antibody was coated onto its surface 15\nby flowing through the channels. The four-channel cell was then turned 90\u00b0, thus creating 16 16\nindependent sensing areas of ~1 mm2, and an equal number of antibody\/antigen signals on a 17\nsingle biochip surface. This multichannel approach has been recently applied to commercial 18\navailable instrumentation (ProteOn\u2122 XPR36, Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA) based on 19\ntraditional SPR transduction. At present, the flow cell is designed to let the same analyte solution 20\ninteract with an array of different probes, minimising the high variability exhibited by21\nmultichannel systems. The internal volumes of most flow cell range from few up to hundreds of 22\nnanoliters and only slight differences in shape can be found between the different instruments.23\nThe SPRimager\u00aeII system (GWC Technologies) can be equipped with flow cells of 24 and 12 24\n\u00b5L internal volume and measurements can be achieved both in stop-flow and recirculation mode. 25\nPage 14 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nIBIS Technologies supplies the iSPR instrument with standard flow cells (30 \u00b5L) and cuvettes 1\n(100 \u00b5L) and the minimum sample volume is 50 \u00b5L. SPRi-Plex and SPRi-Lab+ (Genoptics Bio 2\nInteractions) not allow sample recirculation and the internal volume of the equipped cells is 3\nabout 6 \u00b5L. The minimum volume\/injection ranges from about 20 \u00b5L for SPRi-Lab+ up to 2004\n\u00b5L for SPRi-Plex model. The Biacore family of instrumentation has also recently launched the 5\nFlexchip (GE Healthcare) for up to 400 hundred simultaneous measurements.

The IBIS-iSPR has high 10\nprecision temperature control and both the sample deck (with microtitre plate) and sensor can be 11\ncooled or heated with 0.01-degree precision (\u00b0C) facilitating thermodynamic kinetic analyses. 12\nSPRi-Plex, from Genoptics\u2019 has a Peltier temperature control system between 15\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C 13\nwith a 0.1\u00b0C precision and a 0.01\u00b0C stability. Thermostatic control can be also obtained with the 14\nfully automated Flexchip  in the range 25\u00b0-37\u00b0 C.15\nTo address the lack of temperature control some groups have reported in house developed 16\ntemperature control from 25 to 70\u00b0C (Corne 2008) or temperature scanning to perform 17\nmelting curves on DNA duplexes for point mutation detection (Fiche , 2008). 18\n19\nSPRi Biochips20\nImmobilisation of the molecular probe should be reproducible, retain biological activity and 21\norientate the receptor for optimal binding. Moreover the number and type of probes can vary, 22\ndepending of the application under study. It is not easy to fulfil all these requirements thus ready 23\nto use chips are available from different companies commercialising SPRi instrumentation for 24\nPage 15 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\nnot experienced users. Alternatively many groups familiar with biosensors, report about 1\ninteresting chemical approaches for the SPRi biochips development.2\nThe common strategy for realising spots is to isolate small areas of the surface and to surround3\nthem by an antifouling environment, thus reducing non-specific SPRi signals from background.4\nAn example is the commercial SpotReady\u2122 gold chip (GWC Technologies). 5\nPre-coated chips are also available with different types of chemicals (e.g. \u0000Z-terminated amine6\ncarboxylic functionalities from IBIS Technologies) suitable for further chemical modifications. 7\nElectropolymerisation of pyrrolated-conjugates prepared using pyrrole-NHS, pyrrole-8\nphosphoramidite and pyrrole-hydrazide is also applied for biochip development by Genoptics9\nBehind ready to use biochips, one can develop suitable chemistry for bioreceptor immobilisation. 10\n11\nImmobilisation methods12\nIn SPRi the sensor surface is almost always a thin layer of gold. Most immobilisation techniques 13\ninvolve a first layer of a chemical linker directly bound to the gold, allowing subsequent 14\nanchoring of molecules of interest. The main objective is to create a support structure for the 15\nreceptor that ensures stability under working conditions and access to the analyte, while16\nminimising receptor detachment. The use of a blocking agent prevents non-specific adsorption. 17\nA variety of chemical strategi s have been reported for SPRi-based sensing.18\nA favoured immobilisation method is the use of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the gold 19\nsurface, which increases the degrees of freedom of the probe and, consequently, those of binding20\ntarget molecules. SAMs can be formed by thiol-modified biomolecules, DNA (Manera 21\n, 2008) and RNA (Piliarik 2008) sequences, directly attached to the gold surface by22\nexploiting its high affinity with thiol groups (Fig. 2). Alternatively, the receptor can be 23\ncovalently attached via alkanethiols and alkoxylanes containing \u0000Z-terminated amine (Lee ., 24\n2005; Smith , 2003), hydroxylic (Mannelli ., 2007) or carboxylic (Liu , 2008; Park 25\nPage 16 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\n., 2008; Mannelli , 2007) functional groups (Fig. 2). Probe immobilisation to 1\npolyelectrolyte films via electrostatic interactions has also been reported. In particular, 11-2\nmercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) modified gold surfaces were exposed to a polyelectrolyte film 3\nof branched poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) (Mannelli 2007), in which the amino groups bind the 4\ncarboxylic end of the MUA electrostatically. The high-density extravidin layer then strongly 5\nbinds the biotinylated probes (Bassil 2003) via the extravidin\u2013biotin complex (Fig. 2).6\n7\nAlternatively, SAMs were formed by mixtures of 7 parts to 3 1-mercapto-11-8\nundecyltetra(ethylene glycol) (OEG) and carboxylic acid-capped hexa(ethylene 9\nglycol)undecanethiol (COOH-OEG). Carboxylic groups of COOH-OEG were then activated 10\nwith N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide 11\nhydrochlorid (EDAC) for antibody immobilisation by amino-coupling (Ladd 2008) (Fig. 12\n2). Finally, a SAM layer comprising DNA sequences and OEG was created on a gold surface for13\nthe simultaneous detection of DNA and protein analytes (Ladd 2008a). Thiol-modified single-14\nstranded DNA sequences were spotted onto gold-coated glass substrates, which were then 15\nimmersed in an OEG-terminated thiol solution. This last step created a protein-resistant surface 16\nbackground and improved the orientation of the DNA molecules. Antibodies conjugated to 17\ncomplementary single-stranded DNA sequences were immobilised on the surface through DNA 18\nhybridisation. By converting only part of the DNA array into a protein array, both nucleic acid 19\nand proteins could be immobilised.20\n21\nCorn and co-workers have developed immobilisation protocols over the last decade for 22\nimmobilising nucleic acids (DNA and RNA probes, RNA aptamers), peptides, proteins and 23\ncarbohydrates. Their fabrication procedures uses a reversible protecting groups to manipulate 24\nsurface properties during array construction (Wegner 2004; Brockman 2000) to 25\nPage 17 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\nspatially confine aqueous solutions. A monolayer of 11-mercaptoundecylamine (MUAM) is1\nadsorbed via self-assembly onto an evaporated gold thin film, which can then be reversibly 2\nprotected using organic protecting molecules. In one of the most used methods, a reversible 3\namine, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), acts as protecting group to form a hydrophobic 4\nsurface. By ultraviolet (UV) photo-patterning squares of bare gold are then obtained and further 5\nexposed to MUAM. Thiol-modified DNA is covalently attached to the MUAM squares using a 6\nbifunctional linker, the sulfosuccinimidyl 4-( -maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate 7\n(SSMCC). The linker contains a N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (NHSS) functionality 8\n(reactive toward amines) and a maleimide functionality (reactive toward thiols) (Smith 9\n2003). Alternatively single-stranded, thiol-modified DNA is immobilised using SATP ( -10\nSuccinimidyl S-acetyl-thiopropionate). Deprotection of SH group on the surface is achieved 11\nusing Dithiothreitol (DTT), a small redox molecule, leaving the sulfhydryl to react with 12\ndipyridyl disulphide (DPDS) to create a pyridyl disulfide surface. Finally a thiolated molecular 13\nprobe can be bound to the surface by an exchange reaction between the pyridyl sulphide and the 14\nthiol group of the probe (Fig. 2). 15\n16\nThe formation of a hydrogel film composed of carboxymethyl dextran covalently linked to the 17\ngold surface with the SAM layer is a widely used method to immobilise the probe for SPR and 18\npiezoelectric sensing (Tombelli 2005; L\u00f6f\u00e5s 1995; L\u00f6f\u00e5s and Johnsonn, 1990). By 19\nactivating the caboxymethyl groups, amino-coupling of protein receptors can be achieved. This 20\napproach has been adopted in SPRi for peptide and antibody immobilisation (Beusink 21\n2008). Alternatively, biotinylated molecular probes can be attached via avidin\/streptavidin 22\nbinding previously immobilised using the aforementioned dextran chemistry (Mannelli 23\n2007) (Fig. 2). 24\n25\nPage 18 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nOne limitation of amino-coupling is the lack of control of receptor orientation, since coupling 1\ncan occur randomly with any aminic group on the side-chains. In the case of antibody arrays this 2\nimplies a reduction in the biosensor sensitivity and reproducibility. A number of papers deal with 3\nnew immobilisation procedures to overcome these drawbacks. For antibody arrays, genetically 4\nengineered bacteria were employed to produce protein G with cysteine residues at 5\nthe N-terminus allowing orientation (Lee 2007) (Fig. 3). Cysteine residues can be 6\ngenetically introduced into the specific site of the target protein, and this modified protein forms 7\na properly oriented protein layer through the thiol group adsorption on the gold surface in either 8\nthiolate or disulfide form (Kallwass 1993) for biosensor development (Di Felice and 9\nSelloni, 2004; Persson 1990). Protein G was used as an affinity receptor for antibody 10\nimmobilisation affording better orientation of immobilised antibodies as well as a higher SPRi 11\nsensitivity against antigen targets. Recently, a modified antibody immobilisation introducing a 12\nnovel linker, protein G-DNA conjugate, was reported (Jung 2007) that possesses the 13\nstrengths of both protein G and DNA-directed immobilisation. DNA-directed immobilisation14\nallows spatial assembly of target proteins on DNA-functionalised assay surfaces (Schroeder 15\n2009), resulting in robust and stable chemical linkers (Fig. 3) for SPR transduction and 16\noffering possibilities for SPRi. 17\n18\nAnother immobilisation method involves polymeric species, mainly based on polypyrrole 19\n(Cosnier 2003). Livache and colleagues developed an electropolymerisation technique for 20\nSPRi using the electrochemically directed copolymerization of pyrrole and oligonucleotides 21\nbearing on their 5' end a pyrrole moiety (Bidan 2000) (Fig. 3). The resulting polymer film 22\non the electrode consists of pyrrole chains bearing covalently linked oligonucleotides (a mixed 23\nsolution of DNA-pyrrole and pyrrole monomers). Initially developed for the construction of 24\nDNA chips, the polypyrrole approach has been then extended to other biochemical compounds, 25\nPage 19 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\nmainly proteins (Grosjean 2005) and oligosaccharides (Mercey 2008). The 1\nelectropolymerisation reaction is based on an electrochemical process allowing a very fast 2\ncoupling of the probe directly to a gold working electrode, without the need for further chemical 3\nlinkers.4\n5\nVery recently, in order to synthesise oligonucleotide probes , a quite different approach 6\nhas been proposed by Lockett (2008), to create a more resistant surface to oxidation and 7\nphotodegradation. A lamellar structure in which a thin layer of amorphous carbon was deposited 8\nonto the gold thin film was developed. Carbon-based surfaces can be readily modified with 9\nbiomolecules by attachment of alkene-containing molecules by UV light-mediated formation 10\nof carbon-carbon bonds. The surface was further functionalised with 9-decene-1-ol leading to 11\nhydroxylic terminated surface, which was modified via photolithographic chemical methods, 12\nusing oligonucleotide bases modified with a photolabile 3\u2019-nitrophenylpropyloxycarbonyl-13\n(NPPOC-) protecting group (Fig. 3). 14\n15\nThe best choice of surface attachment chemistry is not yet clearly established mainly because it 16\ndepends on many factors such as the biomolecule type to be immobilised, the sample medium 17\nand the detection method.18\n19\n4. Strategies for signal amplification20\nTypical DNA samples contain attomolar or femtomolar concentrations, which are well below the 21\nnanomolar detection limit SPRi. Hence, sample enrichment (PCR amplification), has been 22\ngenerally applied (Goodrich , 2004a) although in few cases DNA sequences have been 23\ndetected directl extracted from plant using piezoelectric sensing (Minunni , 2005), 24\nPage 20 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\nfrom human lymphocytes by traditional SPR (Minunni , 2007) and from bacteria by SPRi 1\n(Nelson 2002).2\n3\nIn order to increase the sensitivity of SPRi, signal amplification has been developed by: a) 4\nincreasing the SPR output signal through mass or enzymatic processes at the receptor\/analyte 5\nadduct; b) increasing of the intensity of the evanescent field by structuring the chip surface. Mass 6\nenhancement is achieved by addition of molecules which selectively interact with the receptor-7\nligand complex formed at the surface. It was first applied to SPRi for DNA detection  by Jordan 8\n(1997), who combined the hybridisation step with subsequent biotin\/streptavidin binding 9\n(Fig. 4). Both mass and enzyme-based enhancements have been applied to the detection of the 10\nsignalling protein Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) at 1 pM physiological 11\nconcentration (Li . 2007). A VEGF-specific aptamer bound the protein, followed by the 12\naddition of biotinylated anti-VEGF antibody (sandwich-type assay). The SPRisignal was further 13\namplified using an anti-biotin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) which, in presence of an 14\nHRP substrate such as 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), created a localised dark-blue 15\nprecipitation reaction with SPRi signal enhancement (Fig. 4).16\n17\nDNA-linked gold nanoparticles have also been used for SPRi signal amplification with 18\nimmobilised peptide nucleic acid (PNA) sequences to detect point mutations. The target 19\nsequences hybridise the PNA probe on the chip surface and amplification is achieved by DNA-20\nmodified nanoparticles binding to a different region of the target sequence (Fig. 5). Selective and 21\nultrasensitive (1 fM) mismatch recognition was successfully achieved (D\u2019Agata 2008). 22\nFang . (2006) reported a similar approach using a polyadenine (polyA) tail, synthesised 23\n, added to the target sequence to bind its complementary LNA (Locked Nucleic Acid) probe. 24\nPage 21 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\nPolyT-modified nanoparticles, binding the polyA tails were then added to form a ternary surface 1\ncomplex. The reported detection limit for 19-23 mers miRNA was of 10 fM (Fig. 5). 2\n3\nA combination of surface hybridisation, surface ligation and nanoparticle amplification has been 4\napplied to point mutation detection (Li 2006a) by exploiting signal magnification obtained 5\nonly when DNA sequences were fully matched, not containing Single Nucleotide 6\nPolymorphisms (SNPs). Arrays of two sets of probes, differing only in the last nucleotide at their 7\n3\u2019 ends specific to the SNP (Fig. 6, grey bars showed in step 1) were exposed to a target solution8\n(blue bars) containing a second DNA sequence (\u201cligation probe DNA\u201d, orange bar) and Taq 9\nDNA ligase enzyme. Duplexes were formed (Fig. 6; Step 1) where Taq DNA ligase could only 10\nextend the probe sequences with the ligation probe if the receptor did not contain the SNP. After 11\nligation, treatment with 8 M urea selectively denaturated the adducts containing the SNP. 12\nFinally, nanoparticles modified with oligonucleotides complementary to the ligation probe DNA13\nwere added. The SPRi signal, recorded only where the ligation occurred, revealed if the target 14\nDNA contained the SNP (Fig. 6, step 2). The detection limit was 1 pM using 36 mer 15\noligonucleotides and the system was applied to point mutation detection in the BRCA1 gene, 16\nwhich is a breast cancer diagnostic. 17\n18\nA novel approach for DNA detection used RNase H in conjunction with RNA microarrays 19\n(Goodrich 2004 & 2004a) (Fig. 7). The exonuclease selectively destroys RNA sequences 20\nonly in RNA-DNA heteroduplexes, releasing the DNA back to into solution. A single-stranded 21\nRNA (ssRNA) microarray was exposed to a solution containing both complementary DNA and 22\nRNase H (Fig. 7; Step 1). The DNA binds its RNA complement on the surface (Fig. 7, step 2). 23\nRNase H then binds to this heteroduplex, selectively hydrolysing the RNA probe (Fig. 7, step 3), 24\nand then releasing the DNA complement back into solution (Fig. 7, step 4). The released DNA 25\nPage 22 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n15\nmolecule is then free to bind to another RNA probe on the surface, so that a single DNA 1\nmolecule can initiate the destruction of many surface-bound RNA probes (Fig. 7, step 5). With2\nsufficient time, all of the RNA probe molecules are removed from the surface resulting in a3\ndecrease of the SPRi signal (Fig. 7, step 6). Hence, one sequence could in theory prime the 4\nenzymatic catalysis and lead to the destruction of the heteroduplexes on the surface to generate 5\nan observable SPRi signal. In practice, the detection limit was 1000 times improved allowing 6\nDNA detection down to 1fM.7\n8\nOther forms of SPRi amplification focus on surface engineering. Long-Range Surface Plasmons 9\n(LRSPs) are surface electromagnetic waves that can be created on thin metallic films imbedded 10\nbetween two identical dielectric media. LRSPs have been known for almost thirty years (Quail 11\n1983), but have only recently been used for the characterisation of thin-films or for 12\nbioaffinity measurements. Wark (2005) used SPRi to demonstrate the suitability of LRSPs 13\nfor molecular detection and for thin-film sensing in general. A micrometric layer of a 14\ncommercially available inert, optically transparent material (Cytop, CTL-809M.) with a 15\nrefractive index very close to water was deposited on a prism coupler surface. A gold layer was 16\nthen vapour-deposited onto the prism surface and chemically modified for probe immobilisation. 17\nResults obtained showed that it is possible to enhance the SPRi output signal by about 20% due 18\nto the narrow LRSP resonance curve. 19\n20\nImprovement in sensitivity can also be obtained by \u2018\u2018nanostructuring\u2019\u2019 the SPR interface. Lisboa 21\n(2008) patterned the gold surface of SPRi chips using two organothiols, thiolated 22\npolyethylene oxide (PEO), which is unsusceptible to protein and cell adhesion, and 23\nmercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHD) with a carboxylic group suitable for coupling to the amino 24\ngroup of a bioreceptor. The surface was modified with active \u2018\u2018nanospots\u2019\u2019 for subsequent probe 25\nPage 23 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n16\nimmobilisation, surrounded by an inert PEO surface. The nanoarrayed surface produced five 1\ntimes the sensitivity for the Human IgG\/anti Human IgG immunoreaction compared to the 2\nstandard uniform immobilisation.3\n4\n5. SPR imaging transduction in affinity sensing5\nShortly after its introduction by Yeatman and Ash (1987) SPRi was used in a biomolecular 6\napplication for the imaging of phospholipid monolayer films (Hickel 1989). Since then, 7\nSPRi has also been used for surface morphological investigations of many systems, including 8\nself-assembled monolayer films (Evans and Flynn, 1995), mono- and multilayer films prepared 9\nby Langmuir-Blodgett techniques (Duschl 1996) and multilayer films by alternating10\npolyelectrolyte deposition (Nelson 1999). More recently, SPRi was applied in array-type 11\nconfigurations for studying molecular recognitions between nucleic acids, nucleic acids and 12\nprotein, immunoreactions and interaction with carbohydrates.13\n14\n5.1 Nucleic acid arrays for SPRi15\nOver the past two decades, Corn\u2019s research group has optimised immobilisation chemistries for 16\nmicroarray development for SPRi, mainly focusing on DNA and RNA sequences. SPRi has been 17\napplied to hybridisation-based sensing for many applications, including bacterial genotyping, 18\nSNP identification and studing DNA repair. Nucleic acid arrays are also providing innovative 19\ntools for the survey of biomolecular interactions between DNA and RNA sequences and binding 20\nproteins (Jeong 2008; Bouffartigues ., 2007; Wegner ., 2003).21\nOpening up the field of genotyping for environmental and clinical applications, detection of 16S 22\nribosomal RNA from with short, unlabelled DNA and RNA sequences by SPRi was 23\nsuccessfully demonstrated (Nelson 2002; Nelson 2001). Other research groups 24\nPage 24 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n17\n(Manera 2008a; Piliarik 2008, Hottin 2007) have obtained promising results 1\nfor bacterial pathogens, but data are still scarce for real matrices.2\n3\nSpecific RNA arrays for SPRi have been designed to demonstrate the specificity and affinity 4\nbetween synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotics (kanamycins) and RNA sequences (Nishimura 5\n., 2005) to elucidate aminoglycoside-RNA recognition in order to overcome resistance and side 6\neffects of antibiotics. It was shown that kanamycins have non-specific, multiple interactions with 7\nRNA hairpins and that the binding strenght is not always proportional to the antimicrobial 8\nactivity.9\n10\nDue to its capability to discriminate between highly similar nucleotide sequences, SPRi has 11\nrecently gained the attention of researchers investigating SNPs (Fiche 2008; Hayashi , 12\n2008) and gene mutation (Lecaruyer 2006). SPRi applicability for point mutations rapid 13\nscreening, was demonstrated by Livache\u2019s, using in-house apparatus, performing temperature 14\nscans. DNA probe sequences carrying different point mutations were immobilised and15\ndistinguished perfectly matched duplexes from mismatched ones by virtue of their different 16\nmelting temperature over ten temperature scans (Fiche 2008). The results showed that 17\nimaging coupled with temperature scans can be an efficient and low-cost tool for point mutation 18\ndetection on DNA chips.19\n20\nSome crucial enzyme activities have also been investigated using immobilised DNA sequences 21\nsuch as the binding and catalytic properties of DNA N-glycosylase towards damaged DNA sites 22\n(Corne 2008; 2008a). DNA N-glycosylases are enzymes involved in Base Excision Repair 23\n(BER), which is the major mechanism for correction of damaged nucleobases. A decrease of 24\nBER activity is correlated to carcinogenesis and aging and the study of biological interactions 25\nPage 25 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n18\nbetween damaged DNA and repair enzymes have a crucial role in the search for new DNA repair 1\ninhibitors and the understanding of DNA repair mechanisms (Baute 2008).2\n3\nThe importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in gene expression and regulation, as well as in cell 4\nfunction is well established (Williams 2008) and the synthesis of miRNA has been 5\ninvestigated by SPRi (Wark 2008; Fang ., 2006) for possible clinical diagnostic6\napplications. Promising high-quality miRNA profiling for simple, rapid and multiplexed 7\nanalyses is emerging. Another class of nucleic acid sequences, aptamers, represents a 8\ncompetitive tool for proteomic research such as protein biomarker discovery (Tombelli 9\n2007). Aptamers are a promising alternative to antibody microarrays for clinical analysis and 10\nSPRi aptasensing has already been reported for the detection of human Immunoglobulin E 11\n(Wang 2007), human factor IXa (Li 2006) and vascular endothelial growth factor 12\n(Li 2007).13\n14\n5.2 Protein and short peptide arrays for SPRi15\nIncreasing interest in the analysis of peptides and proteins using array formats with surface-16\nsensitive optical techniques like SPRi is prompted by the chance to detect the biomolecular 17\ninteractions without labelling, which may adversely affect molecular structures. Jung 18\n(2005) recently developed protein microarrays for high-throughput SPRi measurements and 19\ntested a SPRi platform for protein\u2013protein interactions (Ro 2005; 2006). The approach20\nfacilitated the study of protein-protein interactions where multiple proteins are involved and 21\ndemonstrated high-throughput monitoring of affinity-tagged proteins in expression and 22\npurification processes (Ro 2005). Moreover, they chose the Human Papilloma Virus E6 23\nprotein with its binding proteins, the ligase E6AP and the tumor suppressor p53, as a model 24\nstudy to investigate the triple protein interaction (E6\/E6AP\/p53) that takes place during the viral 25\nPage 26 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n19\ninfection (Ro 2006). The complex formation induces a degradation of p53 and, 1\nconsequently causes the transformation of normal cells into malignant cells and work in this area 2\nsupports the development of new anticancer drugs against HPV-related cervical cancer. More 3\nrecently, they also reported the study of caspase-3 activation by SPRi (Park 2008). 4\nCaspase-3 is an intracellular cysteine protease and plays a crucial role in the apoptotic cell 5\nprocess. Its activation is commonly used as a biomarker for assessment and understanding of 6\napoptosis, and is conventionally detected using an arti \u0000\u00bf\u0000F\u0000L\u0000D\u0000O\u0000\u0003 \u0000\u00c0\u0000X\u0000R\u0000U\u0000R\u0000J\u0000H\u0000Q\u0000L\u0000F\u0000\u0003 \u0000V\u0000X\u0000E\u0000V\u0000W\u0000U\u0000D\u0000W\u0000H\u0000\u0003 \u0000D\u0000Q\u0000G\u0000\u0003 \u0000:\u0000H\u0000V\u0000W\u0000H\u0000U\u0000Q\u0000\u00037\nblotting. The new method measured a fluorescence signal adapted to SPRi. A chimeric caspase-3 8\nsubstrate (GST:DEVD:EGFP) composed of glutathione S transferase (GST) and enhanced green 9\n\u0000\u00c0\u0000X\u0000R\u0000U\u0000H\u0000V\u0000F\u0000H\u0000Q\u0000W\u0000\u0003 \u0000S\u0000U\u0000R\u0000W\u0000H\u0000L\u0000Q\u0000\u0003 \u0000\u000b\u0000(\u0000*\u0000)\u00003\u0000\f\u0000\u0003 \u0000Z\u0000L\u0000W\u0000K\u0000\u0003 \u0000D\u0000\u0003 \u0000V\u0000S\u0000H\u0000F\u0000L\u0000D\u0000O\u0000L\u0000V\u0000H\u0000G\u0000\u0003 \u0000O\u0000L\u0000Q\u0000N\u0000H\u0000U\u0000\u0003 \u0000S\u0000H\u0000S\u0000W\u0000L\u0000G\u0000H\u0000\u0003 \u0000K\u0000D\u0000U\u0000E\u0000R\u0000X\u0000U\u0000L\u0000Q\u0000J\u0000\u0003 \u0000W\u0000K\u0000H\u0000\u0003 \u0000F\u0000D\u0000V\u0000S\u0000D\u0000V\u0000H-3 cleavage 10\nsequence (DEVD) was developed. Utilizing this caspase-3-dependent proteolytic reporter, they 11\nsuccessfully monitored the proteolytic activity of caspase-3. These results confirm that SPRi 12\noffers new ways to study protein mechanisms without labelling.13\n14\nShort peptides play an important role in identifying important residues in protein-protein 15\nrecognition processes and in the understanding of peptide-DNA interactions and enzymatic 16\nmodification of peptides. Katayama\u2019s group has recently developed SPRi to explore peptide 17\nprobes as kinase substrates (Mori ., 2008; Inamori 2005). The synthesis of drugs 18\nmodulating the activities of particular protein kinases has become a prime focus of the 19\npharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, thus development of high-throughput screening 20\nformats for these enzymes is of crucial interest. Mori and colleagues proposed a novel detection 21\nsystem for on-chip phosphorylation of peptide probes and a zinc(II) chelate compound, working22\nindependently of the amino acid residues on the array, using a single-probe complex, differing 23\nfrom in solution conventional methods (Sola-Penna 2002; Ross 2002). 24\n25\nPage 27 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n20\nSPRi immunosensor based on antibodies arrays, have been also reported. Work dealt with 1\nantibodies orientation for enhancing sensor performance (Jung , 2007; 2008; Lee et al., 2\n2007) and assays for candidate cancer biomarkers. Anti-activated cell adhesion molecule\/CD 3\n166 (anti ALCAM) and anti transgelin-2 (anti TAGLN2) antibodies were employed for the 4\nidentification and quantitation of the relative ALCAM and TAGLN2 antigens (Ladd 2008) 5\nimmobilised in array format. The detection limits in buffer were in the ppb range for both 6\ntargets, which is compatible with physiological levels in human serum (typically 10 to 100 ppb), 7\nalthough high non-specific signals were found in spiked 10-fold diluted commercial serum 8\nsamples. Better results can be expected by improving the surface chemistry to reduce matrix 9\neffects. 10\n11\n5.3 Carbohydrate microarrays for SPRi12\nAs mentioned above, carbohydrates are interesting candidates for array format analysis, but 13\npublications are sparse due to the lack of reliable methods of fabrication. Smith . (2003) 14\nreported the fabrication of mannose and galactose carbohydrate arrays on gold films using poly-15\n(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchannels and their use in SPRi to monitor the binding of the 16\nlectins jacalin and concanavalin A (ConA). They quantified the strength of lectin-carbohydrate 17\ninteractions by determining the adsorption coefficients and the solution dissociation constants for 18\nthe lectins ConA and jacalin, highlighting the potential of SPRi for weak protein-carbohydrate 19\ninteraction studies. Karamanska (2008) recently adopted a similar approach and their data 20\nconfirms the feasibility of a label-free and selective lectin-glycan recognition using SPRi. 21\n22\nAn interesting biotechnological application for screening phage display has been described by 23\nWeiss\u2019 and Corn\u2019s groups (Lamboy 2008) using a polyl-lysine-modified surface created 24\nby the photopatterning of adsorbed 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid. The peptides Lysn (n=16 to 24) 25\nPage 28 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n21\nemerged as optimal for wrapping the phage. The patterned surface was exposed to a solution of 1\nphage in water that was allowed to adsorb electrostatically onto the surfaces. Lysn also provided 2\neffective wrappers for RNA binding in assays against the RNA-binding protein HIV-1 viral 3\ninfectivity factor Vif. The oligolysine peptides blocked non-specific binding to allow successful 4\nselection and screening of the targets.5\n6\n6. Concluding remarks7\nSPRi represents the forefront of label-free and real-time optical detection of many (up to 8\nhundreds) biological interactions simultaneously, furnishing binding profiles for the estimation 9\nof the kinetic parameters of the different interactions between immobilised probes and ligands in 10\nsolution. Most of the immobilisation protocols originate from research on traditional SPR-based 11\nbiosensing. Applications addressed by SPRi vary from protein-protein interactions, hybridisation12\nreactions with DNA, RNA or selected nucleic acids such aptamers with the specific 13\nligands or carbohydrate\u2013lectin interactions. In order to improve sensitivity, signal amplification 14\ncan be achieved by nanopatterning the sensing surface or by addition of enzyme or nanoparticle-15\nlabelled reagents, facilitating detection limits down to 1 fM of DNA for point mutation analysis. 16\nGiven the wide applicability of this emerging technology, some commercial instrumentation has 17\nappeared on the market with dedicated ready-to-use chips. Interest in SPRi technology is rising18\nquickly and we can expect that it will become important in areas ranging from environmental 19\nand food analysis to clinical diagnostics.20\n21\nAcknowledgments22\nMaria Minunni, Coordinator of the project: \u201dAffinity-Based Biosensing (ABB) for gene doping 23\ndetection: an integrated approach\u201d would like to thanks World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 24\nfor financial support.25\n26\nPage 29 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n22\nBibliography1\nBassil, N., Maillart, E., Canva, M., L\u00e9vy, Y., Millot, M.-C., Pissard, S., Narwa, R. & Goossens, 2\nM.

A differential image (left) is produced in real time together with the relative 9\nsensorgrams. As example here are reported two sets of signals  corresponding to the interaction 10\nwith different chemically modified areas. During the specific interaction with the target analyte, 11\nonly the relative specific probe will react, leading to a local change in intensity of reflected light. 12\nThis translates into black\/white contrast for the image. The unspecific receptor series (used as 13\nnegative control) will give negligible or none signal.14\nc) Sensorgrams corresponding to the interactions of the analyte with the spots on the surface.15\n16\nFig. 217\nImmobilisation methods using chemical linkers.

After the formation of the thiolated layer many immobilisation 20\nchemistries can be performed.21\n22\nFig. 323\nImmobilisation methods exploiting direct attachment of the probe to the gold surface of the chip 24\nusing thiol- and pyrrole-functionalised biomolecules.25\n26\nFig. 427\nSignal improvement in SPRi based on mass\/colorimetric approaches. The upper diagram shows 28\nthe DNA hybridisation step followed by addition of streptavidin and biotinylated DNA for signal 29\namplification. In the lower drawing, an aptamer array is exposed to the ligand protein (VEGF) 30\nPage 35 of 35\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n28\nand then biotinylated antibody forms a sandwich-type assay. The SPRi signal was amplified 1\nusing an anti-biotin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) that in presence of a suitable 2\nsubstrate creates a localised dark-blue precipitation reaction.3\n4\nFig. 55\nGold nanoparticles for SPRi signal enhancement. The upper drawing shows gold nanoparticles 6\ncoated with oligonucleotide sequences able to bind the free moiety of the target DNA after the 7\nprobe\/target duplex formation. A similar approach is shown in bottom drawing, in which gold 8\nnanoparticles are coated with a poly-T tail able to bind the target sequence on a suitable poly-A 9\nend.10\n11\nFig. 612\nSignal amplification by a \u201cswitch on\/off\u201d detection strategy: the SPRi signal is produced only if 13\nthe target sequence fully matches to the specific probe sequence. The array consists of two probe 14\ntypes, differing in the presence or absence of a sequence specific to the SNP. The array is 15\nexposed to target solution (blue bars) that contains the ligation probe DNA (orange bar) and Taq 16\nDNA ligase (grey round shape). Duplexes that are formed comprise the combination of probe17\n(grey bars), target sequence (blue bar) and ligation probe DNA (orange bar) regardless of the 18\npresence of the mutation (Step 1). Since ligation occurs only on fully matched duplexes (no 19\nSNP), the addition of nanoparticles carrying nucleotide sequence complementary to the ligation 20\nprobe (Step 2) produces a SPRi signal only if target DNA does not contain the SNP.21\n22\nFig. 723\nDiagram of the approach proposed by Goodrich and colleagues for the enhancement of SPRi 24\nsensitivity. Step 1: a RNA microarray is exposed to target solution containing the enzyme RNase 25\nH and the target DNA sequence; Steps 2 and 3: once the RNA\/DNA heteroduplexes are formed, 26\nRNase H starts to selectively destroy RNA strands in heteroduplexes; Step 4: target DNA strands 27\nare released back to into solution and hybridise other free RNA probes on the surface, promoting 28\nthe their subsequent destruction. The decrease in percent reflectivity becomes larger with time 29\nuntil all of the available RNA probes on the surface are destroyed (Step 6). 30\n"}
