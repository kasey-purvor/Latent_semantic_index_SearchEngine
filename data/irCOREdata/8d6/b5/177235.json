A 2004 systematic review examining the effectiveness of guideline implementation\ninterventions concluded there was a lack of evidence to support decisions about effective interventions to\npromote the uptake of guidelines. Further, the review recommended the use of theory in the development of\nimplementation interventions. A clinical practice guideline for the management of acute low-back pain has been\ndeveloped in Australia (2003). Acute low-back pain is a common condition, has a high burden, and there is some\nindication of an evidence-practice gap in the allied health setting. This provides an opportunity to develop and\ntest a theory-based implementation intervention which, if effective, may provide benefits for patients with this\ncondition.\nAims: This study aims to estimate the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention to increase allied health\npractitioners\u2019 (physiotherapists and chiropractors in Victoria, Australia) compliance with a clinical practice guideline\nfor acute non-specific low back pain (LBP), compared with providing practitioners with a printed copy of the\nguideline. Specifically, our primary objectives are to establish if the intervention is effective in reducing the\npercentage of acute non-specific LBP patients who are either referred for or receive an x-ray, and improving mean\nlevel of disability for patients three months post-onset of acute LBP.\nMethods: The design of the study is a cluster randomised trial. Restricted randomisation was used to randomise\n210 practices (clusters) to an intervention or control group. Practitioners in the control group received a printed\ncopy of the guideline. Practitioners in the intervention group received a theory-based intervention developed to\naddress prospectively identified barriers to practitioner compliance with the guideline. The intervention primarily\nconsisted of an educational symposium. Patients aged 18 years or older who visit a participating practitioner for\nacute non-specific LBP of less than three months duration over a two-week data collection period, three months\npost the intervention symposia, are eligible for inclusion. Sample size calculations are based on recruiting between\n15 to 40 patients per practice. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation.\nTrial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12609001022257 (date registered 25th\nNovember 2009).\nBackground\nDozens of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines\n(CPGs) are published annually with the potential to\nimprove the quality and safety of health care. However,\nfailure to implement CPG recommendations has\nresulted in patients receiving care that is inappropriate,\nunnecessary, or even harmful [1-3]. Effective interven-\ntions are needed to address the barriers to change\nrequired for successful implementation of CPGs.* Correspondence: joanne.mckenzie@monash.edu1School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University,\nMelbourne, Australia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nMcKenzie et al.

Despite some promising\ninterventions, existing studies provide limited guidance\non the factors that moderate the effects of these inter-\nventions in different settings, professional groups, and\nfor different targeted behaviours. Consequently, we\nknow little about how to formulate effective strategies\nfor implementing CPGs. The use of theory has been\nadvocated to inform intervention development with the\npotential to improve our understanding of why a parti-\ncular intervention may be effective [5,6]. Theory can\nprovide an explicit basis for identifying determinants of\nchange and intervention techniques to modify these\ndeterminants. This approach is supported by the United\nKingdom (UK) Medical Research Council (MRC) frame-\nwork for developing and evaluating complex interven-\ntions [7]. Our protocol focuses on the last phase of this\nframework: assessing effectiveness, cost-effectiveness,\nand understanding change processes [8].\nLow back pain (LBP) is a common and costly pro-\nblem. At any one time, 26 in every 100 Australians have\nLBP, and 79% of Australians will experience it at some\ntime in their lives [9]. The direct and indirect cost of\nLBP in 2001 was estimated to total AUD 9,175 million\n[10]. In 2003, the Australian National Health and Medi-\ncal Research Council (NHMRC) endorsed a CPG for\nacute LBP [11] that provided evidence for the diagnosis,\nprognosis and treatment of acute non-specific LBP. The\nrelevant key messages are: that plain x-rays of the lum-\nbar spine are not routinely recommended for people\nwith acute non-specific LBP because they are of limited\ndiagnostic value and provide no benefits in pain, func-\ntion, or quality of life [11]; and advising these patients\nto stay active produces a beneficial effect on pain, rate\nof recovery, and function when compared to bed rest\nand a specific exercise regimen (based on level I evi-\ndence) [11]. While the NHMRC CPG was published in\n2003, recent systematic reviews of randomised trials still\nsupport these two recommendations [12-14].\nThe CPG was disseminated in 2004 via: distribution of\nan evidence summary booklet to 40,000 practitioners in\nAustralia, including allied health practitioners; distribu-\ntion of consumer information sheets; and publicising the\navailability of materials on the NHMRC website. It is\nlikely, therefore, that most practitioners who manage\npeople with LBP will be aware of and have access to the\nCPG. However, recent research in Australian general\npractice indicates that patterns of LBP management (par-\nticularly in relation to the x-ray and advice to stay active\nbehaviours) by general practitioners (GPs) have remained\nunchanged [15]. To our knowledge, the effect that disse-\nmination of the CPG has had on Australian allied health\npractitioners\u2019 behaviour has not been studied.\nThere is a need to establish effective methods for facili-\ntating the uptake of CPGs in allied health. About\none-third of the care for LBP in Australia is provided by\nphysiotherapists and chiropractors [16], however\nresearch suggests that care is not always consistent with\nthe CPG recommendations. International studies demon-\nstrate that chiropractors often investigate people with\nacute non-specific LBP using plain radiography [17-23].\nPhysiotherapy management is less likely to include refer-\nral for plain x-ray, however Australian physiotherapists\u2019\nself-reported use of x-rays for acute non-specific LBP is\nstill too frequent [22], and physiotherapists feel uncertain\nregarding the value of CPGs [24,25].\nA number of randomised trials have investigated the\neffectiveness of interventions to increase compliance with\nCPG recommendations for the management of LBP by\nGPs [26-38]. However, there has been little equivalent\nresearch in allied health settings [39], with only three\ncluster randomised trials (CRTs) reported \u2013 one in the\nNetherlands [40,41], and two in the UK [42,43]. The\nNetherlands CRT evaluated the effectiveness of an inter-\nvention consisting of two interactive workshops designed\nto address barriers to implementation [40,41]. Practi-\ntioners in the intervention group followed the CPG more\nfrequently (odds ratio (OR) 2.05; 95% confidence interval\n(CI) 1.15 to 3.65); however, this did not result in better\npatient outcomes. A UK CRT assessed the effectiveness\nof an evidence-based, local opinion leader-led LBP edu-\ncational program compared to receiving in-service train-\ning on knee pathology management and found no\nevidence of a difference in the odds of practitioners rat-\ning \u2018providing advice to return to normal activities\u2019 in the\ntop five most important treatments delivered to acute\nLBP patients [42]. However, the confidence interval was\nwide and did not exclude potentially important effects.\nAnother UK CRT compared practitioners receiving a\nprinted information package providing evidence-based\nrecommendations to no intervention [43]. Practitioners\nin the intervention group were more likely to record pro-\nviding advice to stay active in response to a single clinical\nvignette (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61). However, these\nstudies did not investigate mechanisms of action of the\ninterventions, limiting the extent to which it is possible\nto explain their findings using theories of behaviour\nchange.\nWe have recently completed a CRT investigating the\neffectiveness of a theory-based intervention for imple-\nmenting the NHMRC CPG in general practice (the\nIMPLEMENT trial) [33]. The current trial (the ALIGN\ntrial) extends this work to allied health. At the writing\nof this protocol (March to May 2010), baseline data col-\nlection, and the physiotherapy and chiropractic interven-\ntions have taken place. Data collection of the patient\nparticipants has just begun.\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 2 of 17\nTrial objectives\nThe primary objective of the ALIGN trial is to esti-\nmate the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention\nthat aims to increase physiotherapists\u2019 and chiroprac-\ntors\u2019 (in Victoria, Australia) compliance with a CPG\nfor acute LBP, compared with providing practitioners\nwith a printed copy of the guideline. Specifically, our\nprimary objectives are to establish if the intervention is\neffective in:\n(i) Reducing the percentage of acute non-specific\nLBP patients who are either referred for an x-ray, or\nreceive an x-ray (practitioner behaviour);\n(ii) Improving the mean level of disability for\npatients three months post-onset of an episode\nof acute non-specific LBP (patient level health\noutcome).\nSecondary objectives include estimating the effects of\nthe intervention for secondary outcomes in the follow-\ning categories: (i) practitioner behaviour (provided\nadvice to stay active, advised bed rest, referred for ima-\nging excluding x-ray), (ii) predictors of practitioner\nbehaviour (practitioner intention to behave in a manner\nconsistent with the CPG\u2019s recommendations, beha-\nvioural constructs (e.g., knowledge, beliefs about capabil-\nities)), (iii) patient health outcomes (pain severity,\nhealth-related quality of life (HRQoL)), (iv) patient\nhealth behaviour (x-ray occurred), and a (v) predictor of\npatient health behaviour (patients\u2019 fear-avoidance beliefs\n(FAB)). In addition, we will assess cost-effectiveness\nbased on the practitioner and patient-level outcomes\ndescribed above, as well as assessment of HRQoL, health\nservice utilisation, and productivity gains\/losses.\nMethods\nTrial design\nThe design of the trial will be a cluster randomised trial,\nwith the clusters being physiotherapy or chiropractic\npractices including one or more practitioners. There are\nchallenges to employing a cluster randomised design\ncompared to patient randomised trials. These include\nincreased sample sizes, with associated additional costs\nand complexity, and increased risk of selection bias at\nthe patient level [44,45]. Selection bias has been shown\nto occur in cluster trials from selective recruitment of\nparticipants by individuals who have knowledge of the\nallocation status [46]. Despite these challenges, randomi-\nsation at the practice level has the benefit of reducing\npotential contamination occurring from practitioners\nconcurrently managing intervention and control\npatients, as would occur in a patient randomised trial\n[47-49], and practitioners within the same practice\nreceiving different interventions, as would occur if\npractitioners were randomised. The latter \u2018contamina-\ntion\u2019 may be seen as beneficial when randomisation\noccurs at the practice level, because this may result in\ngreater diffusion of the intervention from interactions\nbetween practitioners [50]. Therefore in the ALIGN\ntrial, randomisation at the practice level minimises the\npotential for contamination between intervention and\ncontrol groups, while increasing the potential for diffu-\nsion of the intervention within intervention practices.\nEligibility and recruitment\nRecruitment of physiotherapy and chiropractic practices\nSampling frames of physiotherapy and chiropractic prac-\ntitioners were created from lists provided by their\nrespective Victorian Registration Boards. Updated con-\ntact details and information on their practices were\nobtained from the national telephone directory, an inter-\nnet version of the Yellow Pages\u00ae 2009. Practitioners who\nwere unlikely to be eligible (e.g., those practising in ter-\ntiary hospitals or practices obviously not providing care\nfor acute LBP patients) were removed from the sample\nframe. All remaining practitioners were approached and\ninvited to participate (2,463 physiotherapists and 1,196\nchiropractors). Practitioners were sent an invitation let-\nter, explanatory statement, and consent form. Those\nwho did not respond were sent a maximum of four\nreminder letters, each three weeks apart. When one\npractitioner in a practice agreed to participate, a list of\nall practitioners employed at that practice was created,\nand invitation letters were sent to the other practitioners\ninforming them that the practice was included, encoura-\nging them to participate, and allowing them to object to\nthe practice participating if they wished. If the latter\noccurred, we planned to contact the practice manager\nfor direction on whether the consenting practitioners\nwithin the practice could participate.\nTo increase the awareness of the trial, notices were\nplaced in professional newsletters and the trial was pro-\nmoted at conferences. Strategies to promote participation\nin the trial included offering professional development\npoints (for chiropractors in the intervention group only),\npayment for assistance in accessing clinical files of\npatients with acute LBP (AUD 5 per patient), and entry\ninto a draw to win a prize to attend a professionally rele-\nvant conference in Australia (up to a maximum of AUD\n800). In addition, practitioners were advised that some\nrandomly selected participants would have the opportu-\nnity to discuss LBP management with colleagues and\nexperts in the field.\nWe initially intended to recruit 136 practices (68 phy-\nsiotherapy and 68 chiropractic practices), but received a\nbetter than expected response with 210 practices\nwishing to participate. This included 133 physiotherapy\npractices with 180 physiotherapists, and 77 chiropractic\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 3 of 17\npractices with 88 chiropractors. Given the uncertainty in\nthe parameters informing our sample size calculation\n(e.g., intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), see \u2018Sam-\nple size\u2019 section), we made a decision to include all\npractices.\nRecruitment of patient participants\nPractitioners will recruit patient participants over a two-\nweek period at least three months post the intervention\nsymposia. Practices will be provided with study explana-\ntory statements to distribute to all patients over this\nperiod. At each consultation over this period, practi-\ntioners will complete a de-identified patient encounter\nform recording, at a minimum, the date and start time\nof the encounter. The practitioner will provide a brief\nexplanation about the study and will ask each patient\nfor verbal consent to complete a checklist about their\nvisit. If the patient consents, the practitioner will record\nbasic demographic information (date of birth, sex, post\ncode) and will determine if the patient meets the trial\u2019s\ninclusion criteria. Consenting patients with acute non-\nspecific LBP who also meet other eligibility criteria will\nbe considered patient participants. For these patients,\nthe practitioner will complete a checklist of diagnostic\nprocedures and interventions they have ordered, under-\ntaken, or recommended. At the conclusion of the\nconsultation, the practitioner will provide patient parti-\ncipants with additional documentation regarding further\nparticipation in the trial if they wish.\nPatient participants will be provided with a brief\nchecklist to complete and a blank envelope. The check-\nlist asks what diagnostic procedures and interventions\nthey have received, and also invites them to participate\nfurther in the trial by consenting to additional data col-\nlection, either through completion of a survey at three\nmonths post-onset of acute LBP, or allowing their clini-\ncal file to be audited by the research team, or both.\nPatient participants will be asked by the practitioner to\ncomplete the checklist before leaving the practice, place\nit in the provided envelope, seal the envelope, and put it\nin the box at reception. Those who are unable to com-\nplete the checklist at the time of their consultation will\nbe given the option of posting the checklist directly to\nthe research team. Patient participants will be informed\nthat their care will not be affected by their participation\nin the trial, and that the information they provide will\nnot be available to practitioners at the practice. Patient\nparticipants will remain de-identified, unless they con-\nsent to additional data collection (completion of survey\nor file audit, or both). To promote participation in addi-\ntional data collection, patients will be offered the incen-\ntive of being entered into a draw to win a mobile phone.\nThe patient recruitment process has the potential\nto introduce selection bias because patients are recrui-\nted post-randomisation, and this is undertaken by\npractitioners who are aware of their own allocation sta-\ntus [51]. In cluster trials such as ALIGN, which include\npatients with an acute condition, it is generally not pos-\nsible to recruit patient participants prior to randomisa-\ntion of practices [45]. Potential strategies for minimising\nselection bias occurring through patient recruitment in\nALIGN included (i) researchers blinded to group alloca-\ntion recruiting in practices, (ii) reception staff recruiting\npatients, (iii) researchers blinded to group allocation\nsearching clinical files without patient consent, (iv)\nusing de-identified data produced by software for trawl-\ning electronic clinical files, and (v) using administrative\ndata. It was not possible for us to implement any of\nthese options. We did not have the resources available\nto place recruiters at each of the practices (option (i)).\nSome practices did not have reception staff, precluding\nthe use of option (ii). Australia\u2019s state and common-\nwealth privacy legislation does not allow researchers to\naccess clinical files without patient consent (option (iii))\n[52]. Most physiotherapy and chiropractic practices do\nnot use electronic clinical files, precluding the use of\noption (iv). Finally, unlike in the general practice setting\nwhere administrative data on x-ray referral is available\n(MediCare Australia), this data is not available for phy-\nsiotherapists and chiropractors. Given these limitations,\nwe plan to report data to assess potential selection bias.\nDetails are available in sections \u2018Analysis subsets\u2019 and\n\u2018Descriptive analyses at baseline.\u2019\nInclusion criteria\nPhysiotherapy and chiropractic practices were included\nif the following criteria were met:\n1. At least one practitioner within the practice pro-\nvided written informed consent.\n2. The practice was located in the state of Victoria,\nAustralia.\nPhysiotherapists and chiropractors were included if\nthey provided written informed consent and practised\nwithin one of the participating practices.\nPatient participants will be included if the following\ncriteria, determined by the practitioner, are met:\n1. They attend a consenting practitioner for acute\nnon-specific LBP (of duration less than three months).\n2. Provide consent.\n3. Are 18 years of age or older.\n4. Are able to understand and read English.\nExclusion criteria\nPhysiotherapy and chiropractic practices were excluded\nif the practice manager objected to any practitioners\nwithin the practice participating in the trial.\nPhysiotherapists and chiropractors were excluded if\nany of the following criteria were met:\n1. They were investigators of the trial.\n2. They were members of the ALIGN advisory\ncommittee.\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 4 of 17\n3. They were involved in interviews that informed the\ndevelopment of the intervention.\n4. They worked at more than one of the included\npractices in the trial.\nPatients attending the enrolled practices will not be\neligible for inclusion if any of the following criteria are\nmet. These criteria reflect the clinical scope of the acute\nLBP NHMRC CPG [11].\n1. Radicular leg pain is present; this is defined as leg\npain described as shooting, lancinating, or electric in\nquality, extends below the knee, has a dermatomal dis-\ntribution with or without paraesthesia.\n2. They have had previous spinal surgery.\n3. \u2018Red flags\u2019 are present alerting the possibility of ser-\nious conditions such as malignancy, infection, or\nfracture.\n4. They are pregnant.\nRandomisation and allocation concealment\nPractices meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly\nallocated at the same time to receive either the interven-\ntion or control. Restricted randomisation was used to\nreduce the probability of baseline imbalance in potential\nconfounding variables, and to provide greater statistical\npower [50]. Four strata were defined by professional\ngroup (physiotherapists and chiropractors) and the loca-\ntion of the practice (rural or metropolitan; defined from\nthe Rural, Remote, and Metropolitan Areas classification\nsystem [53]). Within stratum, practices were allocated to\nthe intervention and control groups with equal probabil-\nity (1:1 randomisation ratio). This was achieved by gen-\nerating a computer random number (in the statistical\nsoftware package Stata [54]) for each practice, sorting\non the random number within each stratum, and allo-\ncating every alternate practice to the intervention group.\nProfessional group was considered an important strati-\nfication variable, because management of patients with\nacute non-specific LBP may vary because of professional\ntraining and philosophy. A survey of Australian primary\ncare physicians, including physiotherapists and chiro-\npractors, suggested a difference in self-reported x-ray\nuse for acute non-specific LBP between the professional\ngroups [22]. In addition, in 2009 we undertook a survey\ninvestigating the attitudes, beliefs, and intentions of phy-\nsiotherapists and chiropractors in Australia, regarding\ntheir management of patients with acute LBP (response\nrate = 33%, sample size = 469). Differences in intention\nto refer patients for x-ray and provide advice to stay\nactive were found between the professional groups. Spe-\ncifically, of the next 10 patients presenting with acute\nLBP, chiropractors intended to refer 3.7 (95% CI 3.2 to\n4.3) more patients for an x-ray compared to phy-\nsiotherapists, and provide advice to stay active to 0.6\n(95% CI 0.4 to 0.9) fewer patients (Unpublished data:\nO\u2019Connor D, Monash University, Australia).\nWe made a decision to include location of the practice\nas a stratification variable because the rates of x-ray\nreferral may vary with geographical proximity to ima-\nging centres, and because of geographic variation in\nsocioeconomic barriers to health service utilisation,\nincluding diagnostic imaging [55].\nFinally, consideration was given to stratifying by clus-\nter size. Cluster size is quite commonly used as a strati-\nfication variable in community intervention trials [50]\nbecause the size of a cluster is often a proxy for other\nvariables, which may be predictive of outcome, but are\nmore difficult to measure (e.g., educational environment\nwithin a practice). In the ALIGN trial, we did not stra-\ntify by size of the practice because we were not able to\nobtain accurate information on this variable.\nA statistician who was independent of the trial team\nundertook the randomisation. He was provided with a\nfile containing practice codes and stratification variables.\nThe file contained no identifying information about the\npractices.\nBlinding\nIt was not possible to blind investigators involved in the\ndelivery of the intervention to group allocation. In addi-\ntion, due to the nature of the intervention, it was not\npossible to blind the practitioners to group allocation.\nHowever, practitioners only received minimal informa-\ntion about the intervention content in the recruitment\nmaterial. They were informed that they may have to\naccess materials about management of LBP either\nthrough the Internet, or they may be invited to attend\nan interactive workshop. Patient participants will be\ninformed through recruitment materials that their prac-\ntitioner is participating in a study assessing practitioners\u2019\nmanagement of patients presenting with acute LBP; they\nwill not be informed of the study design, and therefore\nof their practitioners\u2019 group allocation. However,\nbecause the practitioner is not blinded, it is possible\nthat they might reveal their allocation to participating\npatients. Outcome assessors extracting data from clinical\nfiles of patients, and research assistants entering practi-\ntioner and patient completed checklists and question-\nnaires, will be blinded to group allocation. The trial\nstatistician will not be blinded to group allocation.\nInterventions\nControl group\nParticipants in control group practices received a\nprinted copy of the summary version of the guideline\nand a written reminder of how to access it [11]. For\nsome practitioners, this provides an additional exposure\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 5 of 17\nto the CPG that was originally disseminated by the\nNHMRC in 2004.\nIntervention group\nIntervention group practitioners received a theory-based\nimplementation intervention developed to address the\nhypothesised determinants of CPG implementation\nidentified in phase one of this project. In phase one,\nsemi-structured interviews, underpinned by a theoretical\ndomains framework [56], were conducted with phy-\nsiotherapists and chiropractors in Victoria, Australia.\nThematic analysis was used to map the identified bar-\nriers and facilitators of the target behaviours to the the-\noretical domains framework. The most salient domains\nidentified formed the basis of a survey, which was dis-\ntributed to a random sample of practising physiothera-\npists and chiropractors in Victoria, South Australia, and\nWestern Australia. The survey quantified the association\nbetween constructs from these domains and intention to\npractice in a manner consistent with the guideline\nrecommendations. Both the findings of interviews and\nsurvey informed the design of the intervention, and will\nbe published elsewhere.\nThe intervention consisted of: a full-day symposium-\nstyle event involving a combination of didactic lectures\ndelivered by peer opinion leaders (identified in consulta-\ntion with representatives from the physiotherapy and\nchiropractic associations), small group discussion led by\ntrained clinical facilitators, and practical sessions; sup-\nporting written material; and a follow-up phone call.\nSeparate symposia were held for physiotherapists and\nchiropractors. All practitioners in the intervention\ngroup, including those who were not able to attend the\nsymposium, received a DVD including videos of the\ndidactic sessions and printed resources about LBP man-\nagement. A clinical member of the project team\nattempted to follow-up all practitioners with a telephone\ncall to discuss difficulties encountered in implementing\nbehaviours and strategies to overcome these. More\ndetail on the intervention, including the development\nprocess, will be reported in a separate publication. Sym-\nposia details are available in Additional File 1 - \u2018ALIGN\nintervention content.\u2019\nFinally, while not formally a component of the inter-\nvention or control group, the practitioner data collection\nprocedure involves completion of patient checklists\nabout LBP management and may act as a prompt to\nchange practitioner behaviour. The checklist includes a\nbroad range of diagnostic procedures and interventions\npotentially used for patients with acute non-specific\nLBP, irrespective of supporting evidence.\nTiming of recruitment, intervention delivery, and follow-up\nThe physiotherapist and chiropractic symposia took\nplace on 20 and 27 February 2010, respectively. Practi-\ntioners in the intervention group were mailed a DVD of\nmaterial from the symposium for their professional\ngroup on 29 March 2010. Practitioners in the interven-\ntion group received a follow-up phone call two to four\nweeks after either attending the symposium or being\nsent the DVD. Materials were sent to the control group\non 10 March 2010.\nPatient participant recruitment will take place over a\nfive-week period, beginning at least three months post-\nsymposium delivery (31 May 2010). Each practice will\nrecruit patients for a period of two weeks (a longer per-\niod was judged to place too great a burden on practi-\ntioners). Practices will be randomly allocated to recruit\npatients in either the first (31 May to 11 June 2010) or\nsecond (21 June to 2 July 2010) data collection period.\nPractitioners who are not able to collect data in either\nof these periods (e.g., on holiday), will be invited to\nselect an alternative fortnight of data collection between\nJuly and September 2010.\nFigure 1 details the timing of recruitment, intervention\ndelivery, and data collection periods for practitioner and\npatient participants.\nIntervention fidelity\nWe will evaluate intervention fidelity, which is the\nextent to which the intervention, as delivered, was\nadhered to as planned [57]. The proportion of practi-\ntioners in the intervention group who attended the\nsymposium, received the follow-up call, and viewed the\nDVD has been documented. The symposia were audio-\nand video-recorded and will be transcribed verbatim.\nObserved adherence will be assessed by content analy-\nsis of the symposium transcripts to evaluate which\nintervention sections were covered, and which beha-\nviour change techniques were delivered. An indepen-\ndent assessor attended each symposium and completed\na checklist to indicate whether or not planned inter-\nvention components and behaviour change techniques\nwere used. We will report the proportion of practi-\ntioners who received each different component of the\nintervention and the data from the checklist completed\nby the independent assessor in the main trial publica-\ntion; the remaining components of this evaluation will\nbe reported in a separate publication.\nStudy outcomes\nPrimary outcomes\nThe primary outcome at the practitioner level is\nwhether the practitioner orders, undertakes, or recom-\nmends a lumbar x-ray for the acute non-specific LBP\npatient over the two-week data collection period (occur-\nring three months post-symposium). The primary out-\ncome at the patient level is LBP specific disability three\nmonths post-onset of their acute LBP episode (Table 1).\nThe rationale for selecting these outcomes as primary\noutcomes is fully described in McKenzie et al. [33].\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 6 of 17\nIn brief, the intervention focused on two key recom-\nmendations from the CPG: diagnostic plain x-rays of the\nlumbar spine are rarely necessary in the management of\nacute LBP, and patients should be advised to remain\nactive. The primary outcome at the practitioner level\nmeasures the effectiveness of the intervention in chan-\nging the practitioners\u2019 behaviour for the first recommen-\ndation, x-ray referral. The primary outcome at the\npatient level measures the effectiveness of the interven-\ntion in changing the practitioners\u2019 behaviour for the sec-\nond recommendation, providing advice to stay active,\nand assessing whether this change results in improve-\nments for the patients in terms of short-term disability.\nSecondary outcomes\nSecondary outcomes include measures of practitioner\nbehaviour (provided advice to stay active, advised bed\nrest, referred for imaging excluding x-ray), predictors of\npractitioner behaviour (practitioner intention to behave\nin a manner consistent with the CPG\u2019s recommenda-\ntions, behavioural constructs), patient health outcomes\n(pain severity, HRQoL), a predictor of patient health\nbehaviour (FAB), and a patient health behaviour (x-ray-\noccurred). The outcomes, data collection methods, and\nassessment periods are included in Tables 1 and 2. Justi-\nfication for the inclusion of these outcomes follows.\nPractitioner behaviour The outcome \u2018imaging referral\nexcluding x-ray\u2019 has been included to estimate the effect\nof the intervention on practitioners\u2019 referral for other\ntypes of imaging. Including this outcome stems from a\nconcern that while practitioners may reduce their use of\nx-rays, they may concurrently increase their use of other\nforms of imaging. Other forms of imaging are rarely\nrecommended for acute LBP [11]. The outcomes \u2018advice\nto stay active\u2019 and \u2018advised bed rest\u2019 have been included\nas additional measures to assess the effectiveness of the\nintervention in changing practitioners\u2019 behaviour, with\nadvice to stay active recommended, and advising bed\nrest not recommended. These outcomes are predicted\nto mediate the relationship between the intervention\nand patient LBP specific disability.\nPredictors of practitioner behaviour We have included\nmeasures of behavioural intention and other behavioural\nconstructs (such as knowledge and beliefs about capabil-\nities) as predictors of behaviour. Several outcomes mea-\nsuring practitioners\u2019 intentions toward behaving in a\nmanner consistent with the CPG\u2019s two recommendations\nFigure 1 Timing of recruitment, intervention delivery, follow-up of practitioner, and patient participants.\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 7 of 17\nare included because intention has been shown to be pre-\ndictive of behaviour [58]. Intention is considered sepa-\nrately from the other behavioural constructs because it is\nthought to mediate the relationship between these\nconstructs and actual behaviour. Details of the other\nbehavioural constructs are reported in Additional File 2 -\n\u2018ALIGN outcome definitions\u2019 and Additional File 3 -\n\u2018ALIGN data collection instruments.\u2019\nPatient health outcomes We have included pain sever-\nity as an additional measure of the effectiveness of the\nintervention on patient level health outcomes because\npain severity is a recommended core outcome measure\nin LBP research [59]. In addition, it is useful to examine\nif the small benefits on pain observed in patient rando-\nmised trials, which underpinned the guidelines, are\nobserved in a pragmatic setting with a less intensive\npatient level intervention.\nWe have included a preference-based measure of\nHRQoL in the set of patient-level outcomes to facilitate\nestimation of intervention effects in terms of quality\nadjusted life-years (QALYs). QALYs are commonly used\nin healthcare priority setting to compare interventions\nover multiple dimensions of HRQoL (in this case pain,\npain-related disability, and physical function inter alia).\nMeasurement of QALYs will permit the results of cost-\neffectiveness analyses to be expressed in terms of incre-\nmental cost per QALY.\nPredictor of patient health behaviour Fear-avoidance\nbeliefs, measured at the patient level, will be included\nas a potential predictor of patient health behaviour.\nTable 1 Outcome measures\nOutcome\n(outcome category)\nData collection method Outcome assessment\nperiod\nSource Level data\ncollected at\nInference intended at the practitioner level\nX-ray referral\n(practitioner behaviour)1\nChecklist completed by\npractitioner\n3 to 4 months post-\nsymposium\nPractitioner Patient\nAdvice to stay active\n(practitioner behaviour)\nChecklist completed by\npractitioner\n3 to 4 months post-\nsymposium\nPractitioner Patient\nImaging referral excluding x-ray\n(practitioner behaviour)\nChecklist completed by\npractitioner\n3 to 4 months post-\nsymposium\nPractitioner Patient\nAdvised bed rest\n(practitioner behaviour)\nChecklist completed by\npractitioner\n3 to 4 months post-\nsymposium\nPractitioner Patient\nX-ray referral (file audit)\n(practitioner behaviour)\nClinical file audit 0 to 7 months post-\nsymposium\nPractitioner case\nnotes\nPatient\nImaging referral excluding x-ray (file audit)\n(practitioner behaviour)\nClinical file audit 0 to 7 months post-\nsymposium\nPractitioner case\nnotes\nPatient\nIntention to adhere to CPG recommendations: Questionnaire Baseline, 4 months post-\nsymposium\nPractitioner Practitioner\nX-ray referral\nImaging referral excluding x-ray\nAdvice to stay active\nBed rest advice\n(predictor practitioner behaviour)\nBehavioural constructs2 (e.g., knowledge, beliefs\nabout capabilities)\n(predictor practitioner behaviour)\nQuestionnaire Baseline, 4 months post-\nsymposium\nPractitioner Practitioner\nInference intended at the patient level\nLBP specific disability1\n(health outcome)\nQuestionnaire 3 months post-onset acute\nLBP episode\nPatient Patient\nPain severity\n(health outcome)\nQuestionnaire 3 months post-onset acute\nLBP episode\nPatient Patient\nX-ray occurred\n(health behaviour)\nQuestionnaire 3 months post-onset acute\nLBP episode\nPatient Patient\nFear-avoidance beliefs\n(predictor health behaviour)\nQuestionnaire 3 months post-onset acute\nLBP episode\nPatient Patient\nHealth-related Quality of Life\n(health outcome)\nQuestionnaire 3 months post-onset acute\nLBP episode\nPatient Patient\nHealth Service Utilisation and Productivity\nGains\/Losses\nQuestionnaire 3 months post-onset acute\nLBP episode\nPatient Patient\nTable adapted from McKenzie et al.

Fear-avoidance beliefs were more frequently\nshown to be associated with acute LBP compared with\nother psychosocial factors, and has been included for\nthis reason.\nPatient health behaviour Patients will be asked if they\nreceived an x-ray. When patients do not receive either a\nreferral for an x-ray or an x-ray from their practitioner,\nthey may choose to see another practitioner who may\nprovide an x-ray referral. While evidence of effectiveness\nof the intervention in changing x-ray referral rates by\npractitioners may be observed, it is of interest to exam-\nine if this ultimately changes the proportion of patients\nwho receive an x-ray.\nOutcome measurement\nPractitioner behaviour will be measured through practi-\ntioner-completed checklists of patient consultations and\nthrough clinical file audit. Practitioners will complete a\nchecklist for each patient consultation over the two-week\ndata collection period, indicating diagnostic procedures\nand interventions ordered, undertaken, or recommended.\nOutcomes measured through the checklists represent\nthe practitioners\u2019 self-reported behaviour approximately\nthree to four months post-symposium delivery. Clinical\nfile audit will be undertaken for consenting patients.\nOutcomes measured through clinical file audit will repre-\nsent practitioners\u2019 behaviour over the period zero to\napproximately seven months post-symposium delivery.\nThe practitioner checklist and details of the data to be\nextracted from clinical file audit are available in Addi-\ntional File 3.\nPredictors of practitioner behaviour will be measured\nthrough a questionnaire, administered as a paper-based\nquestionnaire or through the internet, at baseline and\napproximately four months following symposium\ndelivery.\nPatient health outcomes, patient health behaviour, and\npredictor of patient health behaviour, will be measured\nthrough a questionnaire, administered as a paper-based\nquestionnaire or through the internet, at three months\npost-onset of their acute LBP episode.

Patient participants who have consented to\nfollow-up data collection will be contacted if there is\nmissing data on their patient completed checklist. Prac-\ntitioners of these patient participants will be contacted if\nthere is missing data on the practitioner-completed\nchecklist. Processes will be put in place to monitor the\nnumber of practitioner- and patient-completed check-\nlists received each day over the data collection period.\nA continuous sampling plan will be used to check a\nsample of data extracted from patient clinical files\n[61,62].\nSample size\nThe primary practitioner outcome is x-ray referral. In our\noriginal sample size calculation for this outcome, we\nestimated that we would require 136 practices (68 phy-\nsiotherapy and 68 chiropractic practices), each complet-\ning checklists for an average of 20 patient participants\n(providing a total of 2,720 patient participants), to pro-\nvide 80% power to detect a difference of 10% in x-ray\nreferral between intervention groups. This assumed a\n39% x-ray referral rate in the control group, a 5% signifi-\ncance level, and an ICC of 0.10, and allowed for 20%\nattrition in practices. Empirical research has suggested\nICCs of the order of 0.10 for process variables, such as\nx-ray referral, in primary care [63]. Data on x-ray referral\nrates were not available for the Australian context, so the\nx-ray referral rate of 39% was estimated from interna-\ntional research and assumptions regarding the process of\nx-ray referral in Australia. More specifically, for chiro-\npractors, several international studies have estimated that\nreferral for x-ray for acute LBP ranges from 62% to 72%\n[17,20,23]. For physiotherapists, we assumed that x-ray\nreferral rates would be similar to those found in Austra-\nlian general practice, which has been estimated at 28%\n[64], because many physiotherapists treat patients with\nLBP on referral from, and in conjunction with, GPs.\nBecause we intended to recruit an equal number of\npatient participants from physiotherapy and chiropractic\npractices, we estimated the pooled x-ray referral rate to\nbe 47%. Interventions comparing standard CPG dissemi-\nnation with no intervention control groups have shown\nimprovements in care of approximately 8% [4]. We there-\nfore anticipated a decrease in the percentage of x-ray\nreferral in the control group of this magnitude, providing\nan estimated referral rate of 39%.\nAs previously mentioned, we received a better than\nexpected response from practices wishing to participate\n(133 physiotherapy and 77 chiropractic practices), and\nmade a decision to include all practices because of\nuncertainties in the sample size calculation, including\nour estimate of ICC, the average number of patient par-\nticipants for whom checklists are completed per practice\n(cluster size), variation in the cluster size, and the\nestimated x-ray referral rates. Assuming 168 practices\ncomplete the data collection (allowing for 20% attrition),\nwe have investigated the likely width of the 95% CI for\nthe risk difference and the log odds ratio for the primary\npractitioner outcome x-ray referral, assuming a range of\nvalues of the sample size parameters (Additional File 4 -\n\u2018ALIGN sample size calculations\u2019). From this investiga-\ntion, the width of the 95% CI for the observed difference\nin x-ray referral rates between groups is likely to be in\nthe range of \u00b15% to \u00b17%. On the log odds scale, this is\nequivalent to a range of \u00b10.26 to \u00b10.41.\nEffectiveness analyses\nAnalysis subsets\nThe principle of intention-to-treat (ITT) is generally the\nrecommended analysis approach for randomised trials\nbecause it maintains the comparability of the interven-\ntion groups, in known and unknown prognostic factors,\nbrought about through randomisation, thus providing\nan unbiased estimate of intervention effect. In addition,\nnon-compliance by practitioners and patients is allowed\nfor, therefore providing an estimate of intervention\neffect that is more reflective of actual clinical practice\n[65,66]. For this reason, ITT analysis has been suggested\nfor pragmatic trials [67].\nIn patient randomised trials, requirements of an ideal\nITT analysis include compliance with the randomised\nintervention, no missing responses, and follow-up on all\nparticipants [65]. In a CRT, definition and application of\nan ITT analysis is more challenging [68] because of\ncomplexities with the hierarchical structure of the\ndesign and recruitment of participants potentially occur-\nring post-randomisation of the clusters. More specifi-\ncally, in a CRT such as ours, practices, practitioners,\nand patients may withdraw, or be lost to follow-up. In\naddition, during the recruitment phase of patient partici-\npants, practitioners may not actively recruit patients,\npotentially leading to empty clusters (this may be differ-\nential by group); they may recruit a differential number\nof participants depending on allocation status; or they\nmay selectively recruit patients (leading to patients with\ndifferent characteristics between groups) [68]. Statistical\nmethods for handling missing data and dealing with\nselection bias in CRTs are limited [69], and for some\nforms of missing data (empty clusters), there is currently\nno statistical solution [68].\nWe therefore plan to present a modified ITT analysis\nas our primary analysis, where we will analyse clusters\nand participants (practitioners and patients) as they have\nbeen randomised, regardless of the intervention they\nhave received, but will not impute missing data. As part\nof the secondary analyses, we plan to identify potential\npredictors of missing data through modelling, and\ninclude these predictors in the primary analysis model.\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 10 of 17\nWhere possible, we plan to collect information on rea-\nsons for practice, practitioner, and patient withdrawal.\nTo investigate potential selective recruitment, we will\ncompare the practice list sizes [45], numbers of\nrecruited participants, and their characteristics, between\ngroups (examples of this include [70,71]).\nDescriptive analyses at baseline\nDescriptive statistics of demographic and potential con-\nfounding variables will be presented at baseline for the\npurposes of investigating the comparability of the inter-\nvention groups, and to provide descriptive information\nabout the study sample. Potential confounding variables\nwill include those presented in Figure 2, practitioners\u2019\nself report of the average number of patients they treat\nper week, and the average number of acute LBP patients\nthey treat per week (collected in the practitioner base-\nline questionnaire). In addition, we will compare\nbetween groups measures of the patients\u2019 pain (assessed\nby both the practitioner and patient) and general health\n(assessed by the practitioner) collected at the first visit\nof incident cases of acute LBP over the data collection\nperiod.\nPrimary analyses\nWe will estimate the effectiveness of the intervention\non primary and secondary outcomes with marginal\nmodelling using generalised estimating equations\n(GEEs). These models will appropriately account for\ncorrelation of responses within practice. We plan to fit\nan exchangeable correlation structure, where responses\nfrom the same practice are assumed to be equally corre-\nlated [50,72]. Additionally, we intend to use robust var-\niance estimation that will provide valid standard errors\neven if the within-cluster correlation structure has been\nincorrectly specified [73,74]. For binary outcomes, a\nlogit link function will be used. In the event that the\nICC of an outcome for a particular analysis is negative,\nwe will fit a generalised linear model with no adjust-\nment for clustering (e.g., ordinary linear regression),\nmaking the assumption that in the context of cluster-\nbased evaluations, negative ICCs are more likely to\noccur through sampling error than because of a true\nnegative ICC [50].\nOur primary analyses of outcomes will include adjust-\nment for stratification variables (professional group and\nlocation of the practice) and pre-specified potential con-\nfounding variables (Figure 2). The potential confounders\nhave been selected through discussion amongst the\ninvestigators and from published research (see Figure 2\nnotes). All pre-specified confounders will be included in\nthe models even when no baseline imbalance exists. We\nFigure 2 Potential confounding variables adjusted for in the primary analyses. 1Practitioner checklist; 2Exposure period is the number of\ndata collection days post-patient entry into the trial. 3Clinical file audit; 4Practitioner questionnaire; 5Stratification variable; 6Imaging referral\nexcluding x-ray; 7 Adjusted for the baseline of the relevant behavioural construct (e.g., knowledge (Table 2)) for the specified behaviour\n(managing patients without referral for plain x-ray or advising patients to stay active); 8Practitioners answer yes to the question \u2018Do you primarily\ntreat Work Cover (compensable) patients at your main practice?\u2019; 9Patient questionnaire; 10Managing patients without referral for plain x-ray;\n11Advising patients to stay active; *[100]; \u2020[100,101]; \u00b1[102]; \u2021[103]; \u00b7[104]; II [76]; \u00b6[105]; \u00b0[106].\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 11 of 17\nhave chosen this approach because confounder selection\nstrategies that are based on collected data, (e.g., selecting\nconfounders using preliminary statistical tests) result in\nmodels with poor statistical properties, such as incorrect\ntype I error rates [75-78]. In the circumstance that there\nis limited data or events (e.g., advised bed rest), or both,\nto adjust for all confounders, we will report estimates of\nintervention effect from models including only the strati-\nfication variables, and baseline of the outcome variables\nwhere appropriate (FAB, intention, and behavioural\nconstructs).\nEstimates of intervention effect from these models\nwith binary outcomes will yield odds ratios. In addition\nto the odds ratios, we plan to also provide estimates of\nrisk difference to aid interpretability and provide greater\ninformation to fully assess the implications of the inter-\nvention effects [79]. Estimates of risk difference will be\nestimated from GEEs, with robust variance estimation,\nusing an identity link function [80]. For each outcome,\nthe estimate of intervention effect and its 95% CI will be\nprovided. For the primary outcomes, we plan to provide\nestimates of ICCs and their 95% CIs.\nRegression diagnostics will be used to assess the influ-\nence of outliers on estimates of intervention effect and\nfor analysing residuals. No adjustment will be made for\nmultiple testing. All tests will be two-sided and carried\nout at the 5% level of significance.\nSecondary analyses\nWe will conduct a subgroup analysis to examine\nwhether the effect of the intervention on x-ray referral\nis modified by professional group (physiotherapist versus\nchiropractor). We hypothesise that the effect of the\nintervention may differ by professional group because x-\nrays are seen as more integral to the treatment of\npatients for chiropractors compared with physiothera-\npists [22]. We will examine this by fitting a model that\nincludes an interaction term between intervention group\nand professional group. The estimated ratio of odds\nratios and its 95% CI will be presented from this model.\nGEEs will yield unbiased estimates of intervention\neffect only when data are missing completely at random,\nor when known covariates that are associated with the\nmissing data mechanism are included in the model\n(missing at random) [69]. As part of the secondary ana-\nlyses, we plan to identify potential predictors of missing\ndata through modelling (e.g., [81]), and include these\npredictors in the primary analysis model. We will inves-\ntigate methods to impute missing outcome data col-\nlected at baseline (e.g., baseline behavioural constructs,\nFAB) [82]. Finally, we will investigate methods to adjust\nfor potential differential recruitment [68].\nA disadvantage of using GEEs is that only one level of\nclustering can be modelled. For data collected at the\npatient level, there are three levels of data: practices,\npractitioners, and patients. It is possible to allow for\nclustering at the practice level or the practitioner level.\nWhile we have chosen to adjust for clustering at the\npractice level, because this is the unit of randomisation,\nthere may be an argument for adjusting at the practi-\ntioner level if the variation at this level is larger; this\ncould be predicted to arise because the practitioner has\na more direct influence on patient outcomes (such as\nx-ray referral). We will therefore undertake sensitivity\nanalyses investigating the impact of allowing for cluster-\ning at the level of the practitioner.\nWe plan to undertake explanatory analyses to inves-\ntigate if intervention effects are mediated by our\nhypothesised predictors of practitioner behaviour\n[83-85]. Detailed description of our theoretical model\nand results of these explanatory analyses will form\nseparate publications.\nFinally, we plan to undertake analyses comparing the\noutcomes (e.g., \u2018x-ray referral,\u2019 \u2018imaging referral excluding\nx-ray\u2019) measured via different methods of data collection\n(practitioner completed checklists, patient completed\nchecklists, file audit). In addition, we will undertake sta-\ntistical analyses comparing proxy (e.g., clinical decisions\nin response to vignettes) and direct methods of measur-\ning clinical behaviour [86]. These analyses will be under-\ntaken to add to our knowledge about the design of future\ntrials, but will not be considered part of the trial effective-\nness analyses, and will inform a separate publication.\nEconomic evaluation\nActive implementation entails an additional cost that\nmay or may not be offset by health gains and\/or reduc-\ntions in health service utilisation. Evidence is limited\nregarding this trade-off between incremental costs (sav-\nings) and effects for active implementation versus simple\ndissemination of practice guidelines for management of\nLBP. Hoeijenbos et al. [87] conducted a cost-utility ana-\nlysis comparing standard dissemination versus active\nimplementation of the Royal Dutch Physiotherapy Asso-\nciation (RDPA) guideline for non-specific LBP based on\ndata from the Bekkering CRT [40,41]. While lower per\npatient healthcare utilisation in the active implementa-\ntion group (mean = EUR 125, SD = EUR 91 versus\nmean = EUR 145, SD = EUR 95, p = 0.026) offset the\nrelatively modest incremental treatment cost of active\nimplementation (EUR 366 per physiotherapist), the\nobserved differences in healthcare utilisation (and health\noutcomes) could not be attributed to an intervention\neffect due to failure to control for pre-existing between-\ngroup differences in patient characteristics. Hoeijenbos\net al. [87] therefore concluded that \u2018it is very likely that\nthe extended implementation strategy incurs extra costs\nwithout producing health gains, hence it is very likely to\nbe not cost-effective.\u2019\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 12 of 17\nThe implementation strategy employed by Bekkering\net al. [40,41] and the RDPA guideline differ from the\nALIGN intervention and the NHMRC guideline. Impor-\ntantly, the RDPA guideline contains no specific recom-\nmendation that would limit referral for imaging [88],\nand the implementation strategy employed by Bekkering\net al. [40,41] made no attempt to target referral beha-\nviour for imaging. Another recently completed study\n[33,89] will shortly report on the cost-effectiveness of\nactive implementation versus standard dissemination of\nthe NHMRC guideline, but its findings will relate to\ngeneral practice rather than to the allied health setting.\nFindings from the economic evaluation described here\nwill therefore complement rather than replicate previous\nfindings.\nEconomic evaluation alongside the ALIGN CRT will\nbe conducted with the aim of quantifying additional\ncosts (savings) and health gains arising from the ALIGN\nintervention as compared to access to the guideline via\nexisting practice. Secondary aims will be to determine\nwhether the incremental treatment costs of the ALIGN\nintervention are offset by reductions in health service\nexpenditure (i.e., whether implementing the guideline is\ncost-saving as compared with existing practice), and to\ndetermine whether the ALIGN intervention dominates\nexisting practice (i.e., less costly but no less effective).\nThe time horizon for inclusion of relevant costs and\nconsequences for the trial-based evaluation described\nhere coincides with the final scheduled follow-up of\npatient participants (three months post-onset of their\nacute LBP episode).\nThe proposed economic evaluation will take a societal\nperspective in identifying, measuring, and valuing costs\nand consequences, but some cost categories likely to\nproduce clinically and economically insignificant varia-\ntion in incremental cost will be excluded to simplify our\nanalysis [90]. Likewise, we exclude some dimensions of\nhealth and HRQoL not captured by the patient-level\noutcomes and some (but not all) non-health outcomes\n(e.g., social status) on the grounds that their inclusion\nwould be unlikely to be alter policy recommendations.\nResearch and evaluation costs will be excluded except\nwhere they might plausibly contribute to a clinically sig-\nnificant treatment effect. Costs common and invariant\nto both intervention and control groups (e.g., costs asso-\nciated with development and standard dissemination of\nthe guideline) will not be explicitly calculated for the\nincremental analysis described here.\nIdentification, measurement, and valuation of health\noutcomes\nIn line with the main analysis, the primary outcome for\nthe economic analysis will be x-ray referral to three\nmonths post-onset of patients\u2019 acute LBP episode based\non the practitioner checklist. For the economic analysis,\nwe will conduct a secondary analysis under the assump-\ntion that referral implies occurrence such that patients\nwill be coded as \u2018x-ray received\u2019 if data from any one of\nthe practitioner completed checklist, clinical file audit,\nor patient questionnaire indicate x-ray referral or occur-\nrence. Patients will be coded as \u2018x-ray avoided\u2019 if x-ray\nreferral or occurrence is nowhere indicated in data from\nthe practitioner completed checklist, clinical file audit,\nand patient questionnaire. For the purposes of the eco-\nnomic analysis, x-ray referral and x-ray avoided are\nintermediate measures of mortality and morbidity effects\nthat occur beyond trial-end arising due to reduced expo-\nsure to ionising radiation [91]. Intervention effects with\nrespect to x-ray referral and x-ray avoided to three\nmonths post-onset will be estimated using methods spe-\ncified for the main analysis, controlling for the set of\npotential confounders specified above.\nAdditional secondary outcomes for the economic ana-\nlysis are: any imaging referral (including lumbosacral\nplain x-ray, full spine plain x-ray, lumbar CT scan, lum-\nbar MRI, or bone scan) and any imaging avoided to\nthree months post-onset, LBP-specific disability at three\nmonths post-onset, and HRQoL at three months post-\nonset. The rationale for measuring referral\/avoidance of\nany imaging in the economic analysis is as described\nabove for the outcome \u2018imaging referral excluding x-ray.\u2019\nIntervention effects with respect to any imaging referral\/\navoidance to three months post-onset will be estimated\nusing methods specified for the main analysis, control-\nling for the set of potential confounders specified above.\nLBP-specific disability and HRQoL are included to pro-\nvide measures of differential health outcomes arising\nwithin the trial period due to inter alia any between-\ngroup difference in providing advice to stay active. Inter-\nvention effects with respect to LBP-specific disability\nwill be taken from the main analysis of Roland-Morris\nDisability Questionnaire (RDQ) at three months post-\nonset of their acute LBP episode, controlling for the set\nof potential confounders specified above.\nPreference-based HRQoL weights derived from the\npatient-level AQoL-4D (Assessment of Quality of Life)\nresponses must be combined with a period of time to\npermit estimation of intervention effects in QALY terms\n(and incremental cost-effectiveness in cost per QALY\nterms). Note, however, that follow up of LBP specific\ndisability and HRQoL for the ALIGN study is scheduled\nfor a single time point at three months post-onset. Due\nto feasibility\/resource constraints and to minimise\npatient attrition at the primary endpoint, we decided\nnot to schedule repeated observations on patient level\noutcome measures in the present trial. Findings from\ntwo studies that informed development of the guideline\n[92,93] suggest that any intervention effect with respect\nto pain is likely to arise in the intermediate term (3 to\nMcKenzie et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:86\nhttp:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/5\/1\/86\nPage 13 of 17\n12 weeks) rather than in the short term (<3 weeks).\nBased on this limited information as to the time-path of\nany intervention effect, patients are assumed to transi-\ntion from their baseline health state to their observed\nhealth state (as measured by HRQoL at three months\npost-onset) at three weeks post-onset, remain stable in\ntheir observed health state (as measured by HRQoL at\nthree months post-onset) during the nine weeks from\nthree to twelve weeks post-onset, before transitioning to\nfull or normal health by trial-end. Intervention effects\nwith respect to total QALYs are therefore estimated as\nthe difference between curves for treatment and control\ngroups over the nine weeks from three to twelve weeks\npost-onset of their acute LBP episode using methods\nspecified for the main analysis of patient level clinical\noutcome measures and controlling for the set of poten-\ntial confounders specified above. No attempt has been\nmade to extrapolate from any between-group difference\nat trial-end based, for example, on secondary data as to\nthe relative stability of pain, disability, and return to\nwork between three and twelve months post-onset [94].\nAny between-group differences in transition to chronic\nlower back pain are therefore excluded from our esti-\nmates of incremental effectiveness.\nIdentification, measurement, and valuation of resource use\nIncremental costs will reflect resource use associated with\ndevelopment of the implementation intervention, delivery\nof the implementation strategy, and any changes in clinical\npractice and subsequent health effects. Methods for the\nALIGN cost-analysis will be as described by Mortimer et\nal. [89] for the IMPLEMENT trial (planned analyses) but\npaid and unpaid costs of homecare will be excluded on\nthe grounds that any between-group variation in homecare\ncosts is expected to be quantitatively unimportant.\nGiven the characteristic distribution of health costs\n(truncated at zero and right skewed), the importance\nof obtaining readily interpretable marginal effects, and\nour interest in population-average effects, we will\nmodel intervention effects on health service expendi-\nture and total costs using one-part GEEs with a log\nlink rather than transformed ordinary least squares or\ntwo-part models [95]. Specification of the log link for\nthe GEE model permits natural interpretation of mar-\nginal effects on cost without retransformation [95].\nCorrelation structure, standard errors, and controls for\nconfounding variables will be as specified for the main\nanalysis.\nAdjustment for differential timing\nAll costs will be inflated to current AUD for the year\nof study completion. All costs and benefits will be\nconverted to present values for the year of study com-\npletion using an annual discount rate of 5% in the\nbase-case, and annual rates of 3% and 7% in sensitivity\nanalysis.\nIncremental analysis\nResults from the economic evaluation will be expressed\nas: additional costs (savings) per x-ray referral and per\nx-ray avoided to three months post-onset; additional\ncosts (savings) per any imaging referral and per any\nimaging avoided to three months post-onset; additional\ncosts (savings) per point difference in RDQ at three\nmonths post-onset; and additional costs (savings) per\nQALY gained.\nUncertainty\nCost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) will be\nderived from the joint density of incremental costs\n(\u0394C) and incremental effects (\u0394E) for the intervention\nas compared to existing practice. The joint density will\nbe obtained via non-parametric bootstrapping from the\ndistribution of observed cost\/effect pairs for patient\nparticipants. Separate CEACs will be derived for\nupper\/lower bound estimates of a pre-specified set of\nuncertain parameters not estimated with sampling\nerror: development costs (none, full); unit cost for\npractitioner participant time (AUD 0, average hourly\nwage rate), unit cost for patient travel\/waiting time to\nattend treatment (AUD 0, average hourly wage rate),\nand the discount rate (3%, 7%).\nPublication policy\nThe investigators of the grant will be responsible for\nensuring the results of the trial are published within a\nreasonable timeframe after conclusion of the trial. The\nresults from the trial will be published regardless of the\noutcome. Reporting of this trial will adhere to the rele-\nvant, and most up-to-date, CONSORT (Consolidated\nStandards of Reporting Trials) statements at the time of\nsubmission [79,96-99].\nEthical review\nEthical approval for this trial was obtained from the\nMonash University Human Research Ethics Committee\n(CF07\/1060; CF09\/1956). The investigators will ensure\nthe trial is conducted in compliance with this protocol\nand the Australian National Statement on Ethical Con-\nduct in Human Research [52].\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: ALIGN intervention content.
