Introduction \nAtmospheric nanoparticles have attracted substantial attention from the \nscientific community due to their negative impacts on human health (Donaldson et al., \n2005), urban visibility (Jacobson, 2005) and global climate change (IPCC 2007). \nRecent toxicological and epidemiological evidence indicates that number \nconcentration is one of the most important metrics to assess effects on human health \n(ICRP, 1994; Oberdorster, 2000; Davidson et al., 2005; Donaldson et al., 2005). Road \nvehicles are the dominant source of nanoparticles, contributing up to ~86% of total \nparticle number concentrations in the urban environment (Johansson et al. 2007; Pey \net al. 2009). More than 99% of the particles, by number, in the atmospheric urban \nenvironment are in the <300 nm size range (Kumar et al., 2008a\u2013d; Kumar et al., \n2009a). Exhaust emissions from vehicles can increase ambient number concentrations \nof nanoparticles by two orders of magnitude or more (104\u2013106 # cm\u20133) relative to the \nbackground level (103\u2013104 # cm\u20133) (Kumar et al., 2008c, d; Kumar et al., 2009b). It is, \ntherefore, important to examine emissions from individual vehicles under real driving \nand dilution conditions. However, the situation becomes complex when fine spatial \nscale studies of nanoparticle dispersion are contemplated (e.g. in a vehicle wake) \nbecause of the limited time response of most available instrumentation. Our \npreliminary results (Kumar et al., 2009c) showed that the particle number distribution \nand concentration of nanoparticles changes rapidly in the wake of a moving vehicle \ndue to the influence of a number of transformation processes (i.e. coagulation, \ncondensation, deposition and nucleation). This is because, as the exhaust dilutes and \ncools, volatile precursors present in sufficient concentrations may become sufficiently \nsupersaturated to nucleate, grow and undergo gas\u2013to\u2013particle conversion (Kittelson et \nal., 2006a). This is the key difference between modelling dispersion for standard \n 3 \ngaseous pollutants and nanoparticles. The very short time scales of this evolution (less \nthan a few seconds) call for a more accurate description of the mixing process in the \nvehicle wake than available today. \nA number of methods exist for modelling the dispersion of passive pollutants away \nfrom a roadway, though they very rarely can treat vehicle wakes or include any \nadjustment due to this effect; for example, CALINE4 (Benson, 1989), CPBM \n(Yamartino and Wiegand, 1986), ADMS-Urban (CERC, 2006) and OSPM \n(Berkowicz, 2000). Most of these models treat the emission as a continuous line \nsource, either without any adjustment or by a simple enhancement of turbulence levels  \n(Baker, 2001), despite the significant effect on the dispersion of pollutants that vehicle \nwakes have. There have been a modest number of studies concerning the aerodynamic \nbehaviour of ground vehicles and the effect of ground structures on drag (Eskridge et \nal., 1979; Eskridge and Hunt, 1979; Baker, 2001). However, little attention has been \npaid to the wake properties that are connected with the dispersion of nanoparticles. On \nthe other hand, a number of studies have been dedicated to measurements of \nnanoparticles along the roadside and in street canyon (Charron and Harrison, 2003; \nGidhagen et al., 2004; Brugge et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2008a; Kumar et al., 2008d; \nKumar et al., 2009b). However, the processes of transport and transformation that \nrelate these observations to vehicle tailpipe emissions remain largely unknown. \nThe objectives of this study are to synthesise significant past research work relevant to \nnanoparticle dispersion modelling in the vehicle wakes, together with highlighting \nassociated research gaps. Section 2 presents a critical discussion of the characteristics \nof vehicle wakes and their mixing properties. Section 3 gives an introduction to the \ntransformation processes of nanoparticles emitted by vehicles. The most relevant \n 4 \nliterature on this topic is then reviewed in the following sections, organised in three \ndistinct categories: field measurements (Section 4), wind tunnel experiments (Section \n5) and mathematical modelling (Section 6). Section 7 summarises the previous \nsections, identifies future research needs and sets up a research strategy for \ndeveloping mathematical nanoparticle dispersion models and forming appropriate \nassumptions on the role of fine scale particle dynamics in existing dispersion models. \nSuch models would assist regulatory authorities in designing sensible future actions to \nregulate nanoparticle emissions. \n2. Flow and mixing in the wake of moving vehicles \nA detailed knowledge of flow and mixing processes in vehicle wakes is \nnecessary in order to cope with the very short time scales of nanoparticle evolution \nprocesses; an adequate treatment of such processes is essential for developing reliable \nmathematical models. In this study, we are particularly interested in the case of a \nmoving vehicle with little or no cross\u2013wind. When a vehicle moves forward at \nvelocity V through the undisturbed air, the flow separates from the bluff rear end in \nthe wake. The wake as a whole may generally be divided into two distinct regions: the \nnear wake and the main or far wake (Fig. 1). The near wake is the region of separated \nflow close behind the body. For a road vehicle, it is characterised by both a region of \nrecirculation and the formation of a pair of streamwise longitudinal vortices (Hucho, \n1987). The far wake is an area of general turbulence downstream of the near wake, \nwhich has little discernible flow structure (Hucho, 1987).  \n2.1 Near-wake \nThe near-wake of a car consists of two components: a large scale recirculation \nregion immediately behind the vehicle and a system of longitudinal trailing vortices \n 5 \nwith unsteady fluctuations caused by a variety of effects such as the instability of the \nseparated shear layer and wake pumping (Ahmed, 1981; Hucho, 1987; Baker, 2001). \nThe initial dispersion of the exhaust plume in the near wake becomes important at the \nlocal scale, when receptors (e.g., people) are at close distance (in the same street) as \nthe emission source. However, the level by which this will affect the local scale \ndispersion depends by the local conditions. It is likely that in very dense traffic \nconditions and deep street canyons the near wake may be neglected, but more studies \nare needed to support this hypothesis. \nStudies related to the characterisation of dispersion behaviour in the near\u2013wake are \nmuch rarer than those related to the far wake zone (see Section 2.2). Baker (1996) \ndescribes a model based on the assumption that the pollutant emitted by the vehicle is \nspread uniformly in the near wake (that is the plume is coincident with the vehicle \nwake), using a Gaussian puff approach to calculate the concentrations further \ndownwind. This approach might be acceptable for passive gaseous pollutants, but \nnanoparticles experience transformations on very short time scales (see Section 3) and \na more detailed characterisation of the near wake may therefore be necessary. More \nrecently, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been applied to the near-wake \ndispersion of pollutants (Richards, 2002; Dong and Chan, 2006). The simulations, \nhowever, are limited by the lack of experimental studies specifically aimed at deriving \nsuitable boundary conditions for the numerical calculations. \n2.2 Far wake \nThe most well known and documented vehicle wake theory is that of Eskridge \nand Hunt (1979). Based on the perturbation analysis of the equations of motion the \ntheory describes the velocity field far downstream of a single vehicle moving through \n 6 \nstill air. Using the assumptions of constant vehicle velocity, flat terrain and no wind, \nexpressions were developed for the velocity deficit far downwind of a vehicle i.e. the \nfar wake. A more recent study by Hider et al. (1997) saw the derivation of the same \nexpression using a different method. They also derived expressions for the lateral and \nvertical velocity components. \nDispersion in the far wake is usually treated as a standard Gaussian plume (Baker, \n1996; 2001; Richards, 2002). Very few models take into account the effect of the \nvehicle wake in the dispersion process (see Section 6). \nThe influence of cross-winds has also been studied. The primary effect, either in open \nterrain or within a street canyon, it is to translate the wake in the wind direction \n(Eskridge and Hunt, 1979; Yamartino and Wiegand, 1986; Hider et al., 1997; Baker, \n2001). However, there are other effects due to atmospheric turbulence that are \nstrongly dependent on the surrounding topography (open terrain or street canyon, for \nexample; see Baker, 2001). \nTable 1 summarise some of the key flow and mixing characteristics to be considered \nfor developing a mathematical model for the vehicle wake (near and far wakes). \nClearly, further research is needed for the adequate characterisation of vehicle wakes \nin dispersion models. In particular, almost no information can be found on the mixing \nprocess in the near-wake, though this is the key region where the nanoparticle main \nevolution processes occur (see Section 3). \n3. Short range dispersion of nanoparticles in the urban environment \nThe behaviour of particles in the atmosphere and within the human respiratory \nsystem is determined largely, but not wholly, by their physical properties, which have \n 7 \na strong dependence upon particle size (AQEG, 2005). The smallest group of \nparticles, with diameters of \u226430 nm, are usually referred to as the nucleation mode \n(Charron et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2010a, b, c). Growth of nucleation mode particles, \nprimarily by vapour condensation but also as a result of coagulation processes, leads \nto the formation of accumulation mode particles that are typically between 30 and 300 \nnm in size (Kumar et al., 2010b). Particles in the accumulation mode can have long \natmospheric lifetimes, typically 7-30 days in the absence of rain, much longer than the \nshort-lived particles in the nucleation mode (Kumar et al., 2010b). \nNanoparticles emitted by cars are subject to dilution (mixing) processes very similar \nto those described in the previous section for passive gaseous emissions. They are, \nhowever, also subject to a number of other processes at various stages in their \nevolution (e.g. nucleation, coagulation, condensation and deposition). Ketzel and \nBerkowicz (2004) analysed the time scales associated with different transformation \nprocesses. They concluded that dilution is the fastest transformation process at most \nconcentration levels, followed by condensation. Coagulation and deposition do not \nusually play a significant role in defining particle number concentrations near streets. \nHowever, they did not treat the very first stages of dispersion, where nucleation and \ncondensation are mainly responsible for the formation of nanoparticles. Details of the \ninteraction between dilution and other transformation processes at short distances \nfrom the emission point were studied by Zhang and Wexler (2004). They found that \nthe exhausts emitted from different types of engines retained their own characteristics \nin the first stage of the dilution process. Sulphuric acid\u2013induced nucleation was found \nto be the dominant particle production mechanism, followed by the condensation of \norganic compounds, resulting in the rapid growth of nuclei mode particles and \nrelatively slow growth of accumulation mode particles. This study, however, did not \n 8 \ninclude any effect due to the vehicle wake, which, as described in Section 2, strongly \nmodifies the flow and turbulence fields near the emission source. A summary of the \nsignificance of different transformation processes is reported in Table 2; the table has \nbeen compiled using information from Ketzel and Berkowicz (2004) and the other \nreferences mentioned in this section. \n4. Field measurements \nA number of field measurements of number and size distributions of \nnanoparticles in urban areas have been made using instruments such as scanning \nmobility particle sizers, electrical low pressure impactors, ultrafine particle \ncondensation counters, alone or in combination (Shi et al., 1999; Longley et al., 2003; \nWehner and Wiedensohler, 2003; Weber et al., 2006). A comprehensive review \ncovering this topic can be found in Kumar et al. (2010b). Most of these instruments \nhave low sampling frequencies relative to that required to characterise nanoparticle \ndispersion phenomena in vehicle wakes, hence an instrument with a fast response is \nrequired (Kumar et al., 2009c). The use of one such instrument (a Cambustion \nDMS500) in a street canyon and a vehicle wake was recently reported by Kumar et al. \n(2008a\u2013d, 2009a\u2013c). Yao et al. (2006) confirm the need for fast response \ninstrumentation. They measured the concentration of nanoparticles emitted by a \nvehicle and applied different averaging times in the range from 1 to 120s and \nconcluded that time\u2013averaging data from complex environments, such as street \ncanyons and tunnels, can affect their interpretation and lead to misleading or \nmeaningless deductions regarding particle evolution.  \nField experiments purposely designed for measuring nanoparticle evolution in the \nwakes of vehicles are rare and there\u2019s a clear need for further research. Kumar et al. \n 9 \n(2009c) measured nanoparticle concentrations in the wakes of a moving diesel \nvehicle. In their preliminary experiments, a fixed measurement point was placed 20 \ncm above the ground and used to obtain nanoparticle number concentrations from \nplumes dispersed by diesel vehicles passing over the sampling tube. The results from \nthis particular study are summarised in Fig. 2. An important finding was that the \neffects of transformation processes, such as nucleation and condensation, were \ngenerally complete within about 1 s after emission, showing the rapid evolution of \nparticle number and mass distributions in the near\u2013wake. Because of very limited \nobservations, these preliminary results are useful for understanding the dynamics of \nnanoparticles at very short time scales but not sufficient to enable sensible \nmathematical models to be developed. There is still an need for detailed experiments \nusing the fast response instruments to estimate the evolution time of particle number \nand mass distributions for various types of vehicles running at a range of speeds in \ndifferent urban settings and meteorological conditions, where background particle \nnumber concentrations differ considerably. Additionally, it would be of considerable \nvalue if detailed investigations of the transformation processes were also carried out \nto help address important questions about the role of fine scale particle dynamics. \n5. Wind tunnel experiments \nWind tunnel experiments have been used extensively for determining the flow \ncharacteristics of wake behind vehicles, such as Eskridge and Thompson (1982) and \nHackett et al. (1987), but studies for pollutant dispersion, particularly for \nnanoparticles, are relatively rare. To our knowledge, there have not been any wind \ntunnel experiments involving nanoparticle measurements so far. Results from such \nstudies in the controlled environment of the wind tunnel will be able to complement \nthe data from field studies and, in conjunction with flow and tracer gas measurements, \n 10 \ngreatly contribute to the development of mathematical models. There have been, \nhowever, a number of wind tunnel studies that, even if not directly related to \nnanoparticle dispersion, provide a useful basis for the development of future \nexperiments and mathematical models. Subsection 5.1 describes the extensive work \ncarried out for deriving parameterisation for traffic produced turbulence. This is \nrelevant to enhance our understanding of the mixing process in the near wake (see, for \nexample, Table 1). The following subsection describes the few attempts at \ncharacterising dispersion behaviour in the wake of moving vehicles, in particular in \nthe near wake. The third subsection discusses improvements in the methodologies and \nidentifies further experimental work that can help in the development of models for \nnanoparticle dispersion models in vehicle wake. \n5.1 Traffic produced turbulence \nTraffic produced turbulence (TPT) and its effects on the flow and mixing \nprocesses has been the main focus of a number wind tunnel studies. For instance, \nKastner-Klein et al. (2000a, b; 2001a, b) studied different traffic configurations \n(one-way and two-way) simulated by small metal plates moving on two belts along \nthe street in a wind tunnel model. Their main interest was in the interactions between \ntraffic\u2013 and wind\u2013induced flows in a street canyon. The presence of traffic and its \narrangement were also shown to affect the concentration distribution along the \nleeward canyon wall (Kastner-Klein et al., 2001b). The results were then used to \nderive TPT parameterisations for street canyon models (Kastner-Klein et al., 2003; Di \nSabatino et al., 2003). \nKhare et al. (2002) and Ahmad et al. (2002) used a similar approach, consisting of \nmoving belts carrying model vehicles, in their wind tunnel experiments. The system \n 11 \nwas placed in various types of simulated atmospheric boundary layers, and the effect \nof the traffic condition and the wind direction on the vertical spread of the exhaust gas \nwas examined. Since the main concern was the effect of traffic as a whole on the \ngeneral flow and mixing processes in the urban environment, the above mentioned \nstudies did not analyse in detail the characteristics of the wake behind a single moving \nelement. None of them studied the near wake region of the vehicles.  \n5.2 Dispersion of inert tracers in the vehicle wake \nFor the development of the ROADWAY model, Eskridge and Rao (1986) \ndetermined the optimal turbulence scales in the far wake region of a moving vehicle. \nThis was determined by measuring concentrations of inert gaseous tracer in the far-\nwake (30\u201360 car-heights behind) of a full scale model of a passenger car in the wind \ntunnel. The near-wake was not the focus of their study, though. More relevant to the \nnear-wake was the study conducted by Clifford et al. (1997). They used three \npassenger car models in a row in the wind tunnel, separated by half the car length \nfrom each other and measured the concentration distribution of the tracer on the car \nsurface including air inlet positions. Results of their study highlighted the strong \ninfluence in the mixing process of the car immediately behind the emitted plume. The \nfocus of their study, however, was on internal air quality rather than on the dispersion \nprocess in the near-wake. \nRichards (2002) and Baker (2001) analysed flow and dispersion characteristics in the \nnear-wake of a vehicle model with no cross-wind. Results from these wind tunnel \nstudies highlighted the close relationship between the inert tracer concentration field \nand the velocity and turbulence fields. Concentration fluctuations, measured by a \nflame ionisation detector (FID), were consistent with the fluctuations in the velocity \n 12 \nfield (obtained through a combination of particle image velocimetry, PIV, hot-wire \nanemometry, HWA and flow visualisation methods). The time histories of \nconcentration had a \u201cpeaky\u201d, intermittent nature. Kanda et al. (2006a) measured the \nflow characteristics in the near-wake of small-scale models of a car and a lorry \nemitting a thermally buoyant plume. They used PIV and laser Doppler anemometry \n(LDA) to measure velocity and turbulence fields in the wind tunnel, and a FID to \nmeasure tracer gas concentrations. They found that the buoyancy of the exhaust had \ngenerally a minor effect on the dispersion behaviour. The results from this study were \nthen used as a basis for studying multi\u2013vehicle configurations (Kanda et al., 2006b), \nwith an approach similar to the one adopted by Clifford et al. (1997) in the wind \ntunnel. \nThe effect of cross-winds on a single wake generated by a model of lorry was studied \nby Baker and Hargreaves (2001). The model was placed on a moving model rig and \nwas propelled across a wind tunnel in which an atmospheric boundary layer had been \nsimulated. Experiments were carried out with both open country and with a street \ncanyon wind simulations. \n5.3 Discussion \nIn order to improve our understanding of the flow and mixing processes in the \nnear-wake, and also in the far-wake, more studies on the basic configuration of the \nwake from a single vehicle are needed. As stated above, most of the previous studies \ndealt with more complex situations such as multiple vehicles, cross-winds and \ncomplex geometry (for example, street canyons). They are very useful for deriving \nparameterisations of the traffic flow for use in larger scale models, but cannot be used \nto characterise the single wake. The few studies specifically designed to study a single \n 13 \nwake, and the near-wake in particular (Baker, 2001; Richards, 2002; Kanda et al., \n2006a), have highlighted the differences in the plume behaviour depending on the \nshape of the model and the boundary conditions, so more experimental studies are \nneeded to generalise their findings. \nA possible improvement on past experimental studies would be the use of a rolling \nfloor in the wind tunnel. All the above mentioned studies suffered from the presence \nof a boundary layer developing close to the ground, which can interfere with a \ndeveloping wake flow field and its measurement. Kanda et al. (2006a) tried to prevent \nthis problem by placing the model on an elevated table; nonetheless, a boundary layer \ngrows on the table top and reaches about 3 cm thick at about 1 m from the upwind \nedge of the table, resulting in unrealistic velocity and turbulence fields (Kanda et al., \n2006a). Baker and Hargreaves (2001) solved the problem by using a ballistic model \nwithin the wind tunnel. \nIn order to develop parameterised models specifically designed for nanoparticle \ndispersion there is first a need to understand sufficiently the dispersion of inert gases. \nHowever, as stated at the beginning of this section, measurements of nanoparticle \nnumber concentrations in the wind tunnel, to be possibly compared with field \nmeasurements and numerical simulations, will add valuable information.. In this case, \na few problems need to be overcome to model particle dispersion properly. In \nparticular, the presence of particle elements in the emitted plume adds further scaling \nconditions to have similarity with the full scale situation. For example, see discussions \non similarity criteria in Kind (1986), Xuan and Robins (1994), Goossens and Offer \n(1990) and Parker and Kinnersley (2004). The use of larger scale models is essential \n 14 \nto meet the similarity criteria, besides providing measurements with better spatial \nresolution. \n6. Mathematical modelling \nAs highlighted in the previous sections, further insight is needed on the \ntransformation processes and dynamics of nanoparticles to develop reliable \nmathematical models for the estimation of their number concentrations in vehicle \nwakes. This section provides an overview of approaches for modelling the dispersion \nof pollutants in the wakes of moving vehicles, starting with the most recent advances \nin fully computational models (CFD approach). These have their limitations due to \ntheir complex nature and their requirement of intensive computational resources. The \nmain objective of this section is to discuss possible approaches for fast parametric \nmodels that could be used as stand alone or as sub\u2013modules within a multiscale air \nquality model for routine air quality assessment and forecasts A simple mathematical \napproach, which needs further development, is proposed as an example of such \napproaches. \n6.1 CFD modelling \nWith recent advances in computational modelling, it has become possible to \ninvestigate flow and dispersion characteristics in the wakes of vehicles by using a \nnumerical approach, CFD. However, such methods cannot be used for operational \nmodelling (e.g., real time calculations, forecasting, long\u2013term scenario analysis for air \nquality assessment) because of their resource demands, though but they can be used, \nlike experiments, to gain insight on the phenomena involved, especially when \nintegrated with experimental techniques. \n 15 \nAs already discussed in Section 2.1, a number of approaches to CFD modelling of \ngaseous pollutants in the wakes of vehicles has been attempted. These include \nReynolds\u2013averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) simulations (using the k-\u03b5, RNG k-\u03b5, or k-\n\u03b5\/Chen turbulence models; Richards, 2002; Richards et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2001), or \nlarge eddy simulations (LES; Dong and Chan, 2006; Chan et al., 2008). The latter \napproach is more resource\u2013intensive but has a better potential for unsteady \napplications such as the dispersion of nanoparticles in vehicle wakes. \nThe evolution of nanoparticles can be implemented in numerical models by using the \ngeneral dynamic equation (GDE; Friedlander, 2000). This equation cannot easily be \nsolved, and several numerical techniques have been developed for this purpose, \nincluding sectional methods (Garrick et al., 2006) and the method of moments \n(McGraw et al., 1998). A recent successful application of such methods was carried \nout by Chan et al. (2010); using an LES approach for turbulence, coupled with a \ndispersion model based on the direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM). \nTheir results offer an interesting analysis of the time scales of the processes involved \nin nanoparticle evolution, yielding conclusions similar to those reported in Section 3 \n(see also Table 2), demonstrating the potential of the numerical approach. \nA different numerical technique was adopted by Albriet et al. (2010). They coupled a \nCFD RANS code (using the k-\u03b5 turbulence model) with a box modelling approach for \naerosol dynamics (in particular they adopted the Modal Aerosol Model, MAM). \nComparisons of the numerical results with measured values were promising, though \nthe authors pointed out the necessity of including the vehicle wake for a more correct \ncharacterisation. This may prove to be difficult with the RANS approach, while LES \nmodels may be more suitable for this purpose. \n 16 \nCFD models have proved to be valuable tools for nanoparticle dispersion \ninvestigations. However, despite the fast development of numerical techniques and \nexponential increasing in computational resources, the operational use of such models \nis still very limited and likely to remain so. Routine air quality assessment, including \nair quality forecasting and long-term scenario analysis, need faster approaches; thus \nsimplified parameterised models are still necessary. \n6.2 Dispersion of pollutants in vehicle wake \nGenerally, the dispersion of pollutants in vehicle wakes in parametric models is \naddressed through Gaussian dispersion theory and represents the traffic flow by \nstationary point and line sources placed at intervals along a road, rather than \nconsidering a moving point source (Eskridge and Hunt, 1979; Baker, 1996; 2001). \nDispersion models that include details of the vehicle wake flow (either near or far \nwake) are less common. The few models that consider such effects are primarily \nbased on the wake descriptions developed by Eskridge and Hunt (1979), and \nsuccessive modifications (Eskridge et al., 1979; Eskridge and Rao, 1983; Eskridge \nand Rao, 1986; Baker, 1996; Hider et al., 1997) Hargreaves and Baker, 1997). These \nmodels are only valid at a non-dimensional distance from the vehicle of about X \/ h \u2265 \n15 (where X is the longitudinal distance from the rear of the vehicle, and h is the \nvehicle height). The well known ROADWAY model uses surface similarity theory \nand the wake theory of Eskridge and Hunt (1979) to determine the atmospheric \nstructure along a roadway due to the presence of vehicles (Eskridge et al., 1979; \nEskridge and Rao, 1983; Eskridge and Rao, 1986). A conservation of species or \nadvection\u2013diffusion equation is solved using finite difference approximations to \nobtain the concentration field for multi-vehicle emissions. The model is essentially \ndesigned to predict vertical and lateral concentration distributions near roadways. As \n 17 \npointed out in Section 2.2, the theory of Eskridge and Hunt (1979) and subsequent \ndevelopments by Hider et al. (1997) only describe the velocity and turbulence fields \nin the far wake. While the overall velocity deficit caused by the near wake is included \nas a boundary condition at X = 15 h, the theories do not include detailed modelling of \nthe near wake region and ignore any interaction between the longitudinal vortices and \nthe drag induced wake. \n6.3 Approaches derived from building wakes \nIn contrast with the rare attempts at modelling dispersion in vehicle wake, \nextensive work has been carried out for characterising and simulating the dispersion \nphenomena in the wake of buildings. For example, see the reviews by Canepa (2004), \nWalsh and Jones (2002) and Olesen and Genikhovich (2000). The physical processes \ninvolved are similar to those in vehicle wakes in many respects and a similar approach \ncan be adopted. \nOne of the most advanced models for treating dispersion in the wake of buildings \nunder steady wind conditions is ADMS-BUILD which is included in the ADMS \nmodel. A very similar approach is adopted by another widely used model called \n(PRIME i.e. Plume Rise Model Enhancements) which is developed by the United \nStates Environmental Protection Agency and Electric Power Research Institute \n(Schulman et al., 2000). The ADMS \u2018Building Effects Module\u2019 computes the \ndispersion of pollution from sources near isolated large buildings or an effective \nbuilding representing a group of closely spaced buildings. The model is based on that \nof Hunt and Robins (1982) and is described in more detail by Apsley (1988) and \nRobins et al. (1997). The model assumes a simplified flow field that is based on a well \nmixed cavity (or recirculating flow region, correspondent to the near-wake) and a \n 18 \ndownstream turbulent wake (the far or main wake; see Section 2). It takes into \naccount different source positions (within and out of the near wake) and allows for \ncomplete or partial entrainment into the recirculating flow region. Within the near \nwake region concentrations are assumed to be uniform due to rapid turbulent mixing. \nFor partially entrained plumes, the entrained and non-entrained components form a \ntwo-plume structure downwind (in the far wake). \nStarting from the above modelling approaches, a simple model can be built for \nmodelling pollutant concentrations in vehicle wakes with the integrated use of the \nsituation shown in Fig. 3 and building wake theory. For instance, consider a vehicle \nwith height h moving at speed V into a weak head wind U (i.e. V >> U). The standard \nbuilding wake theory assumes a well mixed near wake region having a volume \u03b1h3 \nand an average exchange velocity v\u2019 operating over the surface area of the near-wake \n\u03b3\u2019h2 (where \u03b1 and \u03b3\u2019 are constants taking into account the shape of the near wake). \nThen the change in pollutant mass per unit time can be expressed as: \n( ) ww CvhqChtt\nm\n\u2032\u2032\u2212=\u2212==\n23\nd\nd\nd\nd \u03b3\u03b1                                    (1) \nwhere m is the pollutant mass in the near-wake, Cw the mean concentration within the \nnear-wake and q the mass flux of pollutant from the near wake. Since V >> U, v' can \nbe assumed to be proportional to the vehicle speed (V) and Eq. (1) can be modified to: \nW\nWwww\nT\nC\nVh\nC\nh\nVCh\nt\nC\n\u2212=\u2212=\u2212= )\/(d\nd\n3\n2\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b3\n                             (2) \nwhere \u03b3V = \u03b3\u2019v\u2019(being \u03b3 another constant), and Tw is the time scale of pollutant decay, \ndefined as Tw = \u03b2 h \/ V; the empirical constant \u03b2 can be taken as \u2248 5 (Fackrell, 1984). \nEquation (2) can be integrated as: \n 19 \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212=\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212=\nh\nxC\nT\ntCC\nw\nW \u03b2expexp 00                               (3) \nwhere x is the distance travelled by the vehicle at time t. Equation (3) shows that \nmaterial is spread by the moving vehicle over a length of road of several times \u03b2h. \nTaking into account a background concentration C(x), and assuming it uniform along \nthe y and z axes (see Fig. 3), Eq. 2 can be rewritten as: \nW\nWw\nT\nCC\nt\nC \u2212\n\u2212=\nd\nd\n                                                    (4) \nand then: \nh\nCC\nVT\nCC\nx\nC W\nW\nWw\n\u03b2\n\u2212\n\u2212=\n\u2212\n\u2212=\nd\nd\n                                           (5) \nleading to: \n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n)(\nd\nd\nd\nd)(\n2\n3 CCh\nx\nCh\nx\nm\nxq ww \u2212=\u2212=\u2212=                                   (6) \nwhere q(x) is the loss rate of pollutant from the wake as the vehicle move along x. \nThis value can be then incorporated as a source term for standard plume models (e.g., \na Gaussian model, taking into account multiple vehicles moving along x and \ncalculating the emission per line length, or a box model to be used within a street \ncanyon). \nNote that this is a very simple formulation that considers only the inert pollutants in \nthe near wake of a moving vehicle in calm or light wind conditions. It needs to be \nfurther refined and validated for the prediction of nanoparticles number \nconcentrations and size distributions after taking into account particle transformation \nprocesses. The proposed model also has its limitations, such as assuming \nconcentrations in the near-wake are uniform, as is also the case in previously \ndeveloped building effect models (e.g. ADMS-BUILD). Nevertheless, it is a useful \n 20 \nbasis that the authors intend to develop further for nanoparticle dispersion, following \nresults from ongoing field and wind tunnel studies (see Section 7). \n6.4 Discussion \nA number of modelling approaches have been attempted in recent years for \nshort range dispersion of nanoparticles and, more generally, aerosols (Pohjola et al., \n2003; Zhang and Wexler, 2004; Zhang et al., 2004; Pohjola et al., 2006). However, \nthey do not include any modifications due to the effect of vehicle wakes. Furthermore, \nmethods for calculating nanoparticle number concentrations in the wake of a moving \nvehicle have not yet even been proposed. \nGiven the importance of the interactions between nanoparticle transformation \nprocesses in the early stages after the emission and the flow and turbulence fields in \nthe near wake, a way of integrating the two approaches must be found. A potential \nmethodology to develop this topic further could come from the approach outlined in \nsubsection 6.2, derived from extensive work on building wakes. However, further \nresearch is needed for adapting this simple approach to the particular characteristics of \nvehicle wakes, such as the flow below the car (unlike buildings), the emission source \nlocated within (or close to) the near-wake, the streamlined shape of the vehicles (and \nthe differences between them). The near-wake dispersion process should also be \nmodelled in more detail if a useful nanoparticle dispersion model is eventually to be \ndeveloped. \n7. Conclusions and future work \nThis article provides an overview of significant past research work relevant to \nmodelling the dispersion of pollutants in the wake of vehicles, with a particular focus \non nanoparticle dispersion. Literature related to vehicle wakes and nanoparticle \n 21 \ndispersion has been reviewed, taking into account field measurements, wind tunnel \nexperiments and mathematical modelling approaches. \nField measurements and nanoparticle dynamics modelling studies highlighted the very \nshort time scales associated with nanoparticle transformations in the earliest stages \nafter emission. These transformations are strongly dependent on the flow and \nturbulence conditions immediately behind the emitting vehicle, hence the need to \ncharacterise these in some detail, especially in the near wake. This is particularly \nimportant when attention is focussed on short range (i.e. street scale) dispersion. Very \nfew studies have addresses this topic and those that do are generally applicable only in \nthe far wake. A simple approach derived from building wake studies has also been \nproposed. Given the lack of experimental studies that could be analysed to determine \nsuitable parameterisations, further research is needed in the areas of wake dispersion \nand nanoparticle dynamics. \nField experiments purposely designed for measuring nanoparticle evolution in the \nwakes of vehicles are rare; there is a clear research need involving fast response \nmeasurements that can provide detailed information on transformation processes \noccurring just after the release of emissions as a result of interactions with the near \nwake flow and turbulence. \nWind tunnel experiments for characterising vehicle wakes have successfully been \nused in the past in the few studies on this topic that can be found in the literature. The \nmethodologies highlighted in those works may be further improved and applied \nspecifically for the development of nanoparticle dispersion models in the wake of \nvehicles. One of the main findings of previous wind tunnel studies is the strong \ndependence of the near wake characteristics on the vehicle shape, so there is a clear \n 22 \nnecessity of studying different geometries in order to generalise the results to be used \nfor model development. None of the previous laboratory studies on pollutant \ndispersion in vehicle wakes involved the use of a rolling floor (although other \nsolutions to the boundary layer development problem exist, as reviewed in Section \n5.3); this technique is widely used in aerodynamic studies and it is essential to \nreproduce realistic flow and turbulence fields in the wind tunnel. Nanoparticle \nconcentration measurements in the wind tunnel have never been attempted; these \nwould greatly help characterise the dispersion process, though care must be given to \nthe key similarity criteria in reduced scale models. \nAs there are several unanswered questions relating to particle dynamics, dispersion \nand modelling at this very fine scale, firm scientific results from ongoing research will \nprovide a sound basis for understanding this topic in a more comprehensive manner. \nFuture work on this topic should address as a priority the following steps: \n\u2022 real\u2013time measurements of particle number distributions at various spatial \nlocations in the wake of vehicles during field experiments; \n\u2022 integration of these measurement by extensive wind tunnel experiments \nallowing aerodynamic studies in realistic conditions with the use of a rolling \nfloor; \n\u2022 development of a mathematical model for the dispersion of nanoparticles \nnumber and size distributions in vehicle wake (e.g., using the approach \nproposed in Section 6.2) using the key findings from the field and wind tunnel \nexperiments. \nSuch work is underway at EnFlo, University of Surrey. The project, funded by the \nEPSRC, will include field measurements using the recently acquired DMS50 \n 23 \nnanoparticle spectrometer, and wind tunnel experiments in the newly built \naerodynamic facility at the EnFlo lab. The project will end in July 2011. \n8.
