This study identifies a sensitivity of\nconvective cloud to spatial variations in soil moisture, based on analysis of satellite observations\nfrom many cases in the Sahel. Patches of wet soil were located using passive microwave data. The\npatches were composited according to length scale, ranging from 37 to 200 km. The response of the\nconvective cloud field to surface variability along the composite cross-section was studied with\nthermal infra-red data. A suppression of convective cloud is evident over the wet soil during the\nafternoon and evening for all but the smallest length scales. Analysis of over 100 individual cases\nwhere convection occurred in the vicinity of a patch revealed that the development of cloud systems\nin their early stages appears to be particularly sensitive to soil moisture.\n1. Introduction\nSoil moisture can play an important role in influencing surface fluxes, the planetary\nboundary layer, and the development of moist convection [e.g. Betts and Ball, 1998]. Much of our\nknowledge concerning the coupling between soil moisture and precipitation has been gleaned from\nnumerical models. However, as shown rather dramatically by Koster et al. [2004], different\natmospheric models have contrasting sensitivities to the land surface.\nTo gain insight into how the coupled system functions, and to better constrain our models,\nobservations are a valuable tool. Monitoring soil moisture on length scales likely to affect moist\nconvection (upwards of a few kilometres) requires the use of satellite data. One of the most\npromising approaches is the use of passive microwave to detect variations in moisture in the top\nfew centimetres of the soil [e.g. Jackson, 1993]. For understanding land-atmosphere coupling, this\nmethod is particularly appealing in regions where the vegetation cover is sparse (dense vegetation\nattenuates the soil moisture signal), and the partition between surface sensible and latent heat is\nrather sensitive to near surface soil moisture. In this study, horizontal variations in soil moisture are\ndetected using microwave data, and the influence of the variability on the atmosphere is assessed\nusing Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) imagery from Meteosat.\n2. TRMM Data Processing\nMeasurements of horizontally and vertically polarised brightness temperature at 10.65 GHz\nfrom the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager are exploited here.\nTRMM data have been used by, amongst others, Bindlish et al. [2003] to make quantitative\nestimates of soil moisture. We use time series of the polarisation ratio in the West African Sahel to\nlocate areas of increased soil moisture. An example of a time series from a region in Niger covering\n 2\napproximately 2000 km2 is presented in Figure 1. Based on satellite measurements available\ntypically once per day, the figure shows low values of polarisation ratio in the aftermath of rainfall,\nfollowed over several days without further storms, by relaxation back to a characteristic \u201cdry\u201d\nvalue. A lower frequency signal (an increase during the wet season) is associated with longer time\nscale changes in the land surface, notably the development of a vegetation layer. The solid line in\nthe figure represents the low frequency changes in polarisation when the soil surface is assumed to\nbe dry. These values are computed by first interpolating pixel values onto a regular grid, then by\nlinearly interpolating in time the maximum polarisation ratio occurring within a moving window of\n21 days. In this paper, daily anomalies in polarisation ratio ( pr) are calculated relative to the low\nfrequency \u201cdry\u201d signal.\nData from TRMM were analysed for a single wet season (June to September 2000) over a\nregion stretching from 10\u00baN to 20\u00baN, and between the Atlantic coast (around 16\u00baW) and 15\u00baE. This\nregion is relatively flat, and is dominated by a strong meridional gradient in rainfall, with the\nvegetation becoming increasingly sparse moving northwards. To illustrate typical spatial patterns of\nsoil wetness detected by TRMM, Figure 2 presents data from two orbits on the evening of August 3\n2000. Values of pr are shown for each pixel in the orbit, based on deviations of the polarisation\nratio from the \u201cdry\u201d value on that day, interpolated to the pixel locations. Areas of significant\ntopography and water bodies are excluded, as are pixels affected by current rainfall based on an\nalgorithm presented by Ferraro et al. [1998]. The figure highlights two distinct large-scale wet\nareas (labelled A and B). These correspond to areas of cold cloud detected using TIR imagery from\nthe previous 15 hours. Wet patch A illustrates the characteristic surface rainfall signature of a\nSahelian Mesoscale Convective System (MCS), travelling approximately 1000 km in a roughly\nsouth-westerly direction.\nTo produce robust results based on a large number of cases, a composite approach was\nadopted. Sections across wet patches of different sizes were combined from data throughout the\ndomain and season. To maintain the highest possible spatial resolution, the cross-sections followed\nindividual scan lines, which arc across the swath (as shown over patch A in Figure 2). Values of pr\nwere averaged over 4 adjacent pixels along the scan to provide data at the resolution of the sensor\n(approximately 37 km [Kummerow et al., 1998]). Wet strips were identified when the 4-pixel\naverage value of pr over some length scale (L) fell below -0.03 whilst values from the adjacent\npixels (within L\/2 of the strip) remained above -0.015. An example of one such strip is shown in\nFigure 2. The crosses mark the bounds of the wet strip on the scan line, which in this case was of\nlength 18 pixels. In the compositing of such soil moisture patterns, a maximum of one strip in every\n3 scans (approximately 42 km) was used to limit the effect of sampling the same 2 dimensional\npatch many times. The resulting composites were made up of 1559 cases of length scales 4 to 22\npixels (37 to 200 km). These cases were distributed fairly regularly in time and space. This ensured\nthat individual cases could not dominate the composite.\n3. Cold cloud field around composite wet strip\nHourly Meteosat TIR data were used to assess the evolution of deep convective cloud along\nTRMM scan lines containing wet strips. Each TRMM pixel contains typically 4 or 5 Meteosat\npixels. For every TRMM pixel in the composite, the percentage coverage of Meteosat pixels colder\nthan a threshold of -40\u00baC was computed. This calculation was performed for a period of 72 hours\nstarting at 0600 UTC on the morning following the TRMM overpass. Figure 3 presents the results\nof this analysis for the 739 strips of between 8 and 20 pixels (74 and 185 km) for the first 30 hours.\nAt all locations along the composite cross-section, there is a strong daytime minimum in cold cloud,\ntypical of the region [e.g. Mathon et al., 2002] with increases in late afternoon and early evening.\n 3\nThere also tends to be more cold cloud in the right of the composite. This is because on average, the\nright hand side samples more southerly pixels, and is therefore climatologically cloudier. The effect\nof the wet patch can be seen by the reduced cloud in the afternoon and evening over wet soils\ncompared to adjacent drier regions. Between 1700 and 2000 UTC when mean convection is\nincreasing rapidly, at the centre of the wet anomaly the effect is equivalent to a 37% reduction in\ncloudiness compared to the values at the left and right hand sides of the figure. A weaker reduction\nin cloudiness over the wet strip is apparent on the evening of day 2 (not shown), after which the\nsignal disappears. It should be noted that the cloud systems associated with the early evening signal\nin Figure 3 are independent of the storms which produced the original soil moisture anomaly, and\nwhich typically occurred the previous day. Rather, the evolution of the composite cloud field is\nconsistent with a negative feedback between soil moisture and convection. Wet soils tend to be\nassociated with less subsequent cold cloud and (assuming that cold cloud is a reasonable proxy for\nprecipitation) less rainfall. As the initial wet patch dries, typically over 1 or 2 days [e.g. Gash et al.,\n1997], and subsequent rain events occur, the surface fluxes in the composite should become less\ncoherent in space, and therefore have a weaker impact on the composite cloud field.\nFigure 4 presents an analysis of evening cloudiness as a function of surface length scale. For\na wet strip of 4 pixels (37 km) there is no discernible impact of soil moisture on variability of cloud\nin the region between 1700 and 2000. Only the large-scale gradient (increasing left to right) is\napparent. For all the remaining length scales examined, cloudiness is reduced over the wet strip\ncompared to the adjacent drier regions, consistent with a negative feedback. Convective cloud is an\ninherently noisy field, and this means that it is not possible to draw statistically significant\nconclusions about the relative strengths of the feedback at length scales larger than 4 pixels from a\ndata set of this size.\n4. Examination of individual cases\nAn impact of soil moisture on cloudiness can be identified from Fig. 3 during certain phases\nof the diurnal and soil drying cycle. However, the composite provides little evidence about the\natmospheric processes involved. We therefore examined individually 108 different patches from the\ncomposite where cold cloud was detected between 1700 and 2000 UTC. For each case, time series\nof Meteosat imagery were analysed to locate the initiation of the cloud system, the characteristics of\nthe system upstream of the patch, and its evolution as it passed over the wet patch. An example of\none such case is presented in Figure 5. In this case, data from a TRMM orbit at 2215 UTC on 12\nJune highlight distinct wet areas associated with cold cloud from that morning. On the following\nafternoon (13 June), convection was initiated in 3 locations (X, Y and Z). These systems expanded\nand propagated towards the south-west. However, system Y moved to the north-west rather than\npass over the wettest soil, whilst the latitudinal expansions of systems X and Z were halted at the\nedges of wet areas.\nThe single case presented in Figure 5 suggests that the development of the convective\nsystems was strongly influenced by the soil moisture field. Based on similar visual analysis of the\n107 other cases, some firmer conclusions can be drawn concerning the origins of the composite\nmean pattern (Figure 3). In only 2 of the 108 cases was a convective system initiated over wet soil.\nIn 58 cases (54%), cold cloud cover decayed sharply moving across dry-wet transitions, as in Figure\n5. In 28 cases (26%), the cloud pattern bore no discernible similarity to the soil moisture, whilst the\nremaining 22 cases did not fall conclusively into either of these categories. Further analysis based\non how far upstream the systems initiated provided additional insight. Of the 39 systems initiated\nwithin 100 km of the patch, 34 (87%) exhibited less cloud over the wet patch than the surroundings.\nSystems initiated further upstream tended to be much larger by the time they reached the wet patch\n 4\nand showed a markedly lower apparent sensitivity to the wet patch, with only 51% of cases\nillustrating cloud gradients located above soil moisture transitions. Overall, this analysis suggests\nthat the relatively weak storm activity apparent in Fig. 3 over the wet strip is linked to the initiation\nand passage of small convective systems (typically less than 200 km across). Possible physical\nmechanisms to explain this finding are discussed below.\n5. Discussion\nThe data presented here show marked suppression of cold cloud during the afternoon and\nevening over wet soils as compared to adjacent drier areas. This signal is associated with\nsuppressed convective initiation over wet soils. There is a tendency in the dataset for small-scale\nconvective systems to propagate over dry soils, whilst larger systems appear less sensitive. The\nimplied negative feedback between soil moisture and precipitation contrasts with the results of\nTaylor and Lebel [1998] from this region, who proposed a positive feedback mechanism operating\nat scales ~ 10 \u2013 15 km to explain observed persistent rainfall patterns.\nA possible explanation lies in the thermodynamics of convective initiation. Surface fluxes\nfrom wet soils produce shallower, moister and cooler boundary layers compared to drier soils.\nHowever, the sensitivity of convective initiation to soil moisture depends not only on surface\nprocesses. The stability of the layer into which the boundary layer is growing is considered to be\nimportant for determining the sign of a feedback [Ek and Mahrt, 1994]. Findell and Eltahir [2003]\nargue that if the temperature profile between 900 and 700 hPa is close to dry adiabatic then the\ntriggering of moist convection is more likely when soils are dry. This is the case in the Sahel, where\nthe deep, well-mixed Saharan air layer overlies a shallow moist adiabatic monsoon layer [Parker et\nal., 2005]. Thus one might expect convective initiation to occur preferentially over dry soils - a\nnegative feedback.\nHowever, about 90% of the rainfall in the Sahel is produced by long-lived and well-\norganised MCS [Mathon et al., 2002], and the physics of a soil moisture feedback may differ here\nfrom the convective initiation case. Organised MCS are associated with a strong cold pool that\nforces ascent, and rainfall is sensitive to convective available potential energy (CAPE). Dry soils\nproduce lower CAPE than wet soils, and a positive feedback from MCS (as inferred by Taylor and\nLebel [1998]) may be favoured. In the present study, the negative feedback is strongest during the\nlate afternoon and early evening, when convective systems tend to be small [Mathon et al., 2002],\nand is indeed relatively weak for longer-lived systems.\nOther satellite studies looking at the impact of land cover variability on cloudiness have also\nfound suppression of afternoon convection over relatively freely evaporating surfaces [Carleton et\nal., 2001; Negri et al., 2004; Rabin et al., 1990]. The former two studies both hypothesised a key\nrole for the pre-storm dynamical response of the atmosphere to the surface forcing. Strong\nhorizontal gradients in sensible heat flux can generate sea breeze type circulations in the lower\natmosphere. From modelling studies [e.g. Avissar and Liu, 1996] the mesoscale updrafts of such\ncirculations could provide the focus for moist convection. In the context of this study, one would\nexpect afternoon convective initiation to occur preferentially over dry soils adjacent to the wet\npatch, with a strong dependency on patch length scale, as found here. Such circulations are rather\nsensitive to the large-scale wind conditions, a characteristic that we were unable to isolate in this\ndataset using wind data from atmospheric analyses. A better understanding of the role of such\nprocesses in surface \u2013 atmosphere feedbacks will certainly emerge from the forthcoming African\nMonsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (AMMA) campaign in the summer of 2006.\n 5\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was funded by the NERC through the CLASSIC Centre NER\/P\/S\/2002\/00205, and by\nthe European Union Framework 6 Integrated Project, AMMA-EU.
