In order to cope with these demands, the systems must provide knowledge about the  business process itself and the organisational context in that these processes operate [Jarvis et al, 1999].  It, however, is not an easy task to provide the \\ud\nappropriate and sufficient knowledge at the right level of abstraction that supports a  workflow system at all stages of operation  in a dynamic environment and for different types of users.At the same time, Enterprise Modelling (EM) methods are well recognised for their value  in describing complex domains in an organised  but usually informal structure.  In  particular, business process modelling techniques provide rich conceptualisations  that tend to describe the type of information  required by the adaptive workflow systems. However, because of their lack of formal structure the use of Enterprise Models that  have been developed is limited [Junginger, \\ud\n2000][Chen-Burger, 2001a].We propose the use of a formal language within a three-layered framework.

In its \\ud\ncurrent state of development, FBPML  (Fundamental Business Process Modelling \\ud\nLanguage) covers business processes,  organisational structure, agents and their \\ud\ncapabilities as well as execution logic that gives direct instructions to a workflow \\ud\nengine.We assist modelling efforts of Enterprise  Modellers by giving them a visual \\ud\nmodelling language, underpinned by a formal  representation, that is expressive and easy to use and that lets them specify the information required by a workflow \\ud\nengine.  In  this  paper, we present our  formal enterprise modelling language, FBPML.
