Here, EC and dermal or synovial fibroblasts were\ncultured on opposite surfaces of 3-lm pore filters and incorporated in\nstatic or flow-based migration assays. Fibroblasts had little effect on\ntumour necrosis factor-a-induced transendothelial migration of neutroph-\nils, but tended to increase the efficiency of migration away from the endo-\nthelium. Surprisingly, similar close contact between EC and fibroblasts\nstrongly reduced lymphocyte migration in static assays, and nearly abol-\nished stable lymphocyte adhesion from flow. Fibroblasts did not alter\nendothelial surface expression of adhesion molecules or messenger RNA\nfor chemokines. Inhibition of attachment did not occur when EC-fibro-\nblast contact was restricted by using 0\u00024-lm pore filters, but under these\nconditions pre-treatment with heparinase partially inhibited adhesion. In\nthe 3-lm pore co-cultures, inhibition of metalloproteinase activity par-\ntially recovered lymphocyte adhesion, but addition of CXCL12 (SDF-1a)\nto the endothelial surface did not. Hence, the ability of EC to present acti-\nvating chemokines for lymphocytes may have been enzymatically inhib-\nited by direct contact with fibroblasts. To avoid contact, we cultured EC\nand fibroblasts on separate 3-lm pore filters one above the other. Here,\nfibroblasts promoted the transendothelial migration of lymphocytes.\nFibroblasts generate CXCL12, but blockade of CXCL12 receptor had no\neffect on lymphocyte migration. While stromal cells can provide signal(s)\npromoting leucocyte migration away from the sub-endothelial space,\ndirect cell contact (which might occur in damaged tissue) may cause dis-\nruption of chemokine signalling, specifically inhibiting lymphocyte rather\nthan neutrophil recruitment.\nKeywords: endothelial cells; fibroblasts; lymphocytes; migration; neutrophils\nAbbreviations: EC, endothelial cells; IFN-c, interferon-c; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocytes; TNF-a, tumour necrosis factor-a.\n\u0002 2010 The Authors.

Recently, we reported the continuous migration of\nlymphocytes back and forth across cytokine-treated endo-\nthelial monolayers in a \u2018frustrated\u2019 manner.7 In addition,\nlymphocytes showed little penetration of substrates (such\nas collagen gel) underneath cultured EC even after\nhours.7,10,11 On the other hand, neutrophils quickly infil-\ntrated collagen gels underneath cytokine-treated endothe-\nlium.7 We proposed that lymphocytes might be actively\nretained by EC until a separate stromal signal induces\nmigration into the underlying tissue.7\nThere is increasing evidence that interactions between\nvarious stromal cells and EC influence the recruitment of\nleucocytes.8,12\u201317 However, the role of pericytes as regula-\ntors of the endothelial-mediated leucocyte recruitment\nremains ambiguous. We showed that co-culturing EC\nwith secretory smooth muscle cells augmented cytokine-\ninduced capture of flowing leucocytes.14 Furthermore,\nhepatocytes promoted lymphocyte adhesion to hepatic\nsinusoidal EC in response to lymphotoxin.15 More\nrecently we reported that rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts\ndirectly induced endothelial capture of flowing neutroph-\nils and lymphocytes.8,16,17 In contrast, dermal fibroblasts\ncultured with EC reduced lymphocyte adhesion induced\nby TNF-a + IFN-c.8 None of these studies addressed the\nability of the recruited leucocytes to migrate through the\nEC and stroma, because the co-cultured cells were on\neither side of 0\u00024-lm pore filters, which did not allow\npassage of cells. Others have shown that culturing endo-\nthelial and epithelial cells on opposite sides of 3-lm pore\nfilters marginally enhanced neutrophil chemotaxis to\ninterleukin-8 (IL-8).13 On the other hand, renal tubular\nepithelial cells inhibited migration of neutrophils through\nTNF-a treated EC.18 Dermal fibroblasts from scleroderma\npatients promoted the migration of a T-cell line through\nan immortalized EC line coated on an 8-lm pore filter,12\nwhen the fibroblasts were cultured on the plate under-\nneath.\nHere we examined whether fibroblasts isolated from\nthe skin or the synovium of patients with rheumatoid\narthritis could provide signals to recruited leucocytes, spe-\ncifically releasing lymphocytes from the endothelium and\/\nor improving their migration efficiency. Initially, the cells\nwere cultured on opposite surfaces of 3-lm pore filters to\nenable studies of migration through the complete con-\nstruct. Because we found unexpected inhibition of recruit-\nment of lymphocytes when fibroblasts and EC were\nbrought into such close contact, we also carried out stud-\nies using smaller pore filters, and using EC and fibroblasts\non closely juxtaposed but separate filters. These studies\nrevealed that fibroblasts could have different effects on\nneutrophil or lymphocyte recruitment, depending on the\ndegree of the contact with the EC.\nMethods\nIsolation of human leucocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial\ncells\nVenous blood from healthy individuals was collected in\nEDTA tubes (Sarstedt, Leicester, UK). Neutrophils were\nisolated by centrifugation using a two-step density gradi-\nent as described.19 Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL)\nwere isolated using Histopaque 1077 followed by panning\non culture plastic to remove contaminating mono-\ncytes.7,8,20 Isolated cells were washed, counted and\nadjusted to the desired concentration in phosphate-buf-\nfered saline containing Ca2+, Mg2+ and 5 mM glucose or\nMedium 199 (Gibco Invitrogen Compounds, Paisley,\nUK), both supplemented with 0\u000215% bovine serum albu-\nmin (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) (PBSA or M199BSA\nrespectively). The PBSA was used for short perfusions in\nflow-based assays, while M199BSA was used for longer\ncultures of leucocytes with EC. In some experiments, lym-\nphocytes were treated for 15 min with 1 mg\/ml of the\nCXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100 (AnorMED Inc., Langley,\nBC, Canada). We have previously demonstrated that this\ntreatment inhibits lymphocyte recruitment from flow to\nEC co-cultured with synovial fibroblasts.8\nTissue samples from synovium and overlying skin were\nobtained from the same patients with rheumatoid arthritis\nand fibroblasts were isolated as previously described.21 Cells\nwere cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco Invitrogen Com-\npounds) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf\nserum, minimum essential medium\u2013non-essential amino\nacids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U\/ml\npenicillin and 100 lg\/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma)\nand used between passages 5 and 9.8\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)\nwere isolated from umbilical cords using collagenase as\npreviously described22 and cultured in M199 supple-\nmented with 20% fetal calf serum, 1 ng\/ml epidermal\ngrowth factor, 35 lg\/ml gentamycin, 1 lg\/ml hydrocorti-\nsone (all from Sigma) and 2\u00025 lg\/ml amphotericin B\n(Gibco Invitrogen Compounds).8 All human tissue was\nobtained with informed consent and with approval\nfrom the South Birmingham Local Research Ethics\nCommittee.\nCulture of endothelial cells and fibroblasts on Transwell\nfilters\nFibroblasts and EC were dissociated using trypsin\/EDTA\n(Sigma) and co-cultured on the opposite sides of 24-well\nor six-well, low-density, 3\u00020 lm or 0\u00024 lm pore Transwell\n2 \u0002 2010 The Authors.

HU-\nVEC were then seeded on the inner surface of filters at a\nconcentration that yielded confluent monolayers within\n24 hr. For comparison, parallel cultures of HUVEC were\nseeded inside filters without fibroblasts. The cells were\ncultured in fibroblast medium for 24 hr or 4 days, after\nwhich 100 U\/ml TNF-a (Sigma) was added alone or in\ncombination with 10 ng\/ml IFN-c (Peprotech Inc., Lon-\ndon, UK) for 4 or 24 hr. In some experiments, a neutral-\nizing antibody against IL-6 (clone 6708, 5 lg\/ml; R&D\nSystems, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK) was added when\nco-culture was established and was present during cyto-\nkine treatment. We have previously demonstrated that\nthis treatment inhibits the ability of fibroblasts to modu-\nlate EC recruitment of leucocytes from flow.8,16 Alterna-\ntively, cytokine-treated endothelial mono- and co-cultures\nwere treated with 100 ng\/ml CXCL12 (SDF-1; Peprotech)\nfor 30 min before assay. In another series, EC were cul-\ntured alone for 4 days to establish a stable monolayer\nbefore co-culture with fibroblasts for 24 hr.\nThe following enzymes or enzyme inhibitors were\nadded to co-cultures when desired, and were present dur-\ning the cytokine treatment: 10 lM galardin [a broad-spec-\ntrum inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and\nsome ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family\nmembers; BioMed International, Exeter, UK]; 10 mU\/ml\nheparinase I (bacterial homologue to human heparin-\nase23) (Oxford Glycosciences, Abingdon, UK); 30 U\/ml\nhyaluronidase (broad spectrum enzyme which cleaves\nhyaluronan and chrondroitin sulphate); 100 lg\/ml a1-an-\ntitrypsin (inhibits trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatic and\ngranulocytic elastase and acrosin); 50 lg\/ml aprotinin\n(broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor) (all from\nSigma).\nFor studies to investigate soluble mediators, conditioned\nmedium was collected from unstimulated fibroblasts or\nco-cultures. Subsequently, an endothelial monolayer was\ncultured in this conditioned medium along with TNF-\na + IFN-c for 24 hr. Alternatively, conditioned medium\nwas collected from endothelial mono- or co-cultures fol-\nlowing 24 hr of stimulation with TNF-a + IFN-c, and\ntransferred to a second endothelial monolayer for 24 hr.\nMigration of leucocytes through Transwell filters \u2013 static\nassay\nLeucocyte migration was assessed using 24-well format\nTranswell filters as previously described.7,24 Co-cultures\nwere washed to remove residual cytokines, fresh M199BSA\nwas placed in the lower chamber and purified leucocytes\n(200 ll at 2 \u00b7 106cells\/ml) were added to the upper cham-\nber. The cells were allowed to settle, adhere and migrate at\n37\u0003 in a CO2 incubator for the desired period, typically\n2 hr for neutrophils and 24 hr for PBL. Migration was\nstopped at the chosen time by transferring the filter into a\nfresh well, leaving the transmigrated cells in the original\nlower chamber. The leucocytes suspended in the upper\nchamber were removed, and pooled with cells obtained\nwhen the filter was washed twice. These cells were taken to\nrepresent non-adherent cells.\nFor neutrophils, the non-adherent and transmigrated\ncells were counted using a Coulter Multisizer II (Coulter\nElectronics Ltd, Essex, UK). Adherent cells (representing\nall cells that bound to the culture whether they transmi-\ngrated or not) were calculated by subtracting the non-\nadherent population from the total number of cells added\nto each well. From the known number of added neutroph-\nils, the percentages that adhered or transmigrated were cal-\nculated. For lymphocytes, cells were counted and their\nsurface phenotypes were analysed by flow cytometry.\nFreshly isolated, non-adherent or transmigrated cells were\nlabelled with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD4, fluores-\ncein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8 (Becton Dickin-\nson, Oxford, UK) or Cy5-conjugated anti-CD45RA\n(Serotec, Oxford, UK) for 30 min on ice. Fixed volume\ncounts for positively labelled cells were made using a Coul-\nter XL flow cytometer and analysed using WINMDI soft-\nware. In this way, we calculated the percentages of CD4+,\nCD8+ and memory T-cells that adhered and transmigrated.\nAgain, adherent cells were calculated by subtracting the\nnon-adherent counts from the total number of cells added.\nIn a variant on this assay, EC or fibroblasts were cul-\ntured on the inner surface of 24- or 12-well 3-lm pore\nTranswell filter inserts respectively. After 24 hr, the 24-\nwell inserts were fitted into the 12-well inserts and cells\nwere cultured together for 24 hr. This arrangement\nbrought the EC within about 250 lm of the fibroblasts\nbut did not allow contact. Co-cultures were treated with\ncytokines as above. The PBL were added and allowed to\nadhere for 10 min after which non-adherent cells were\nremoved and analysed by flow cytometry as above. After\n24 hr, migrated cells suspended in the medium between\nthe two filters or in the lower chamber were collected. Fil-\nters were treated with Accutase (Gibco) to dissociated\nmigrated cells associated with the endothelial or fibroblast\nmonolayers, and washed twice. Cells from each compart-\nment were pooled with their respective washes and analy-\nsed by flow cytometry as above. Migration was quantified\nas the sum of the lymphocytes located in the compart-\nments beneath the endothelial monolayer; i.e. in medium\nbetween the two filters, attached to the fibroblasts or in\nthe lowest chamber.\nLeucocyte recruitment from flow and subsequent\nmigration through co-cultures\nFilters were cut from the six-well format Transwell hold-\ners, placed on a 75 \u00b7 25 mm coverslip and incorporated\n\u0002 2010 The Authors.

At the other end, it was connected to an elec-\ntronic valve (Lee Products, Gerrards Cross, UK) which\nselected flow from reservoirs containing purified leuco-\ncytes or cell-free PBSA. A 4-min bolus of leucocytes was\nperfused over the EC followed by cell-free wash buffer.\nVideo recordings were made of five microscope fields\nalong the centreline of the flow channel after 2 and\n11 min of washout. By adjusting the focus, recordings\nwere made of endothelial surface and then of the under-\nside of the filter, the fibroblast layer and the coverslip sur-\nface. Between these times, a single recording was made of\nthe endothelial surface to allow lymphocyte migration\nvelocity to be analysed.\nThe video recordings were digitized and analysed off-\nline using IMAGE-PRO PLUS software (Media Cybernetics\nUK, Marlow, UK). Leucocytes bound to the endothelium\nwere counted, and each was classified as either: (i) rolling\nadherent (spherical cells moving over the surface much\nslower than free-flowing cells); (ii) stationary or firmly\nadherent (typically with distorted shape and actually\nmigrating slowly on the surface); (iii) transmigrated\nunder the endothelial monolayer (phase dark and spread).\nCells migrated into the layers below the filter were also\ncounted. Transmigrated cells were subdivided into cells\nlocated above or beneath the filter. The total number of\nadherent leucocytes (i.e. all behaviours) was averaged per\nfield and expressed \/mm2\/106 cells perfused.26\nThe migration velocities of phase-dark neutrophils\nunderneath the endothelium were measured by digitizing\na sequence of images 10 seconds apart for 5 min. Individ-\nual cells were outlined and the position of their centroid\nwas determined each minute. Migration velocity (lm\/\nmin) was the average distance moved by the centroid per\nminute.\nGene expression by EC\nTrypsin\/EDTA was used to detach HUVEC from the\ninside of filters, and messenger RNA (mRNA) was iso-\nlated from the cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,\nCrawley, UK). The mRNA levels of CXCL9, -10 and -11\nchemokines were analysed by reverse transcription\u2013poly-\nmerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR), followed by densitom-\netry of product bands run on agarose gels containing\nethidium bromide, as described.8 The mRNA for E-selec-\ntin, VCAM-1 and b-actin was analysed by quantitative\nreal-time PCR using a Quanti-Tect\u0004 probe RT-PCR kit\nas described previously.8 The VCAM-1 and E-selectin 6-\ncarboxy-fluorescein (FAM)-labelled primers and b-actin\nVIC-labelled primers were bought as Assay on Demand\nkits from Applied Biosystems (Warrington, UK). Samples\nwere amplified using the 7900HT Real-Time PCR\nmachine and analysed using the software package SDS\n2.2 (Applied Biosystems). Data were expressed as relative\nexpression units to b-actin.\nFlow cytometry of endothelial surface receptors\nFilters were incubated with non-conjugated antibodies\nagainst E-selectin (1.2B6) or VCAM-1 (1.4C3; both Dako,\nEly, UK) or with mouse immunoglobulin G1 as negative\ncontrol for 30 min at 4\u0003, washed and incubated with goat\nanti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second-\nary antibody (Dako) for 30 min at 4\u0003 as previously\ndescribed.8 All samples were washed and incubated with\nenzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco) for 30 min.\nThe EC were retrieved, washed and analysed using a\nCoulter XL flow cytometer. Data were expressed as med-\nian fluorescent intensity.\nStatistical analysis\nVariation between multiple treatments was evaluated\nusing analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett\ntest for comparison with control or Bonferroni multiple\ncomparison test as appropriate. P < 0\u000205 was considered\nas statistically significant.\nResults\nMigration of neutrophils through co-cultures of EC\nand fibroblasts\nWe first investigated whether fibroblasts modified neutro-\nphil migration through endothelium when the two cell\ntypes were cultured on opposite sides of 3-lm pore fil-\nters, with or without TNF-a treatment. In a static assay,\nneutrophils adhered to and migrated through EC more\nefficiently after TNF-a treatment (Fig. 1a,b), but co-cul-\nture with fibroblasts had no significant effect on adhesion\nor migration, with or without endothelial stimulation\n(Fig. 1a,b). Next, we extended the duration of co-culture\nto 4 days and re-examined effects on migration after\ntreatment with TNF-a. Under these conditions, migration\ntended to be increased when EC were cultured with fibro-\nblasts, but this effect was of borderline statistical signifi-\ncance (Fig. 1c; P = 0\u000206 by ANOVA). Hence, under static\nconditions, the presence of fibroblasts has only slight\neffects on neutrophil migration.\nSubsequently, we directly observed the effects of\nfibroblasts on neutrophil recruitment from flow and sub-\nsequent migration using a novel filter-based assay.8,25\nSynovial fibroblasts induced the capture of flowing neu-\ntrophils to otherwise unstimulated EC (353 \u00b1 102 adher-\n4 \u0002 2010 The Authors.

Under these conditions, most captured neu-\ntrophils were rapidly activated and became stationary\nadherent, with \u0003 40\u201350% migrating through the endothe-\nlial monolayer after 11 min of washout. The overall pro-\nportion of adherent cells transmigrating did not vary\nsignificantly between monocultures or co-cultures\n(Fig. 2b). However, when migrated cells were divided into\nthose above or below the filter, the presence of fibroblasts\ninduced a greater proportion of migrated neutrophils to\npass through the filter (Fig. 2c).\nWe also noted that the velocity of cells migrating\nimmediately below the endothelial monolayer tended to\nbe slower in the presence of fibroblasts (6\u00028 \u00b1 3\u00027 lm\/\nmin with dermal or 6\u00023 \u00b1 2\u00021 lm\/min with synovial\nco-cultures) compared with EC alone (9\u00020 \u00b1 1\u00022 lm\/min;\nmean \u00b1 SEM for three experiments), although this did\nnot reach statistical significance. Overall, fibroblasts had\nrelatively little effect on the migration of neutrophils\nacross the EC, but tended to alter behaviour under the\nendothelium and promote onward migration.\nMigration of lymphocytes through co-cultures of EC\nand fibroblasts\nWe examined the ability of fibroblasts to modify the adhe-\nsion and migration of lymphocytes through EC with or\nwithout TNF-a + IFN-c. Under static conditions, in the\nabsence of cytokine treatment, PBL and CD4+ or CD8+ T-\ncell subsets (enumerated separately by flow cytometry)\ntended to be bound less efficiently to EC co-cultured with\nfibroblasts compared with EC cultured alone (Fig. 3a).\nFew lymphocytes migrated through the unstimulated cul-\ntures, but again, fewer migrated through co-cultures than\nendothelial monocultures (Fig. 3b). Adhesion and trans-\nmigration were increased and less variable after cytokine\ntreatment. Under these conditions, dermal fibroblasts sig-\nnificantly inhibited adhesion compared with EC cultured\nalone, and co-culture with either type of fibroblast mark-\nedly reduced transmigration (Fig. 3). Similar suppression\nof migration by fibroblasts was observed when TNF-a\nalone was used as the stimulus (data not shown).\nThe above effects were evident for both the CD4+ and\nCD8+ T-cell subsets (Fig. 3). In general, there was enrich-\nment of memory CD4+ T cells in the migrated popula-\ntion, as has been reported previously.7,10,11,27 For\nexample, despite the overall reduction of transmigration,\nCD45RA) (memory) cells represented 83 \u00b1 7% or\n91 \u00b1 4% of CD4+ T cells migrated through dermal or\nsynovial co-cultures respectively, compared with 62 \u00b1 2%\nin the original PBL population (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 3 in\neach case; P < 0\u000201 by Dunnett test). Hence, there was an\noverall inhibition of the migratory process, rather than\nthe loss of a specific lymphocyte sub-population.\nRecruitment of flowing lymphocytes by co-cultures\nThe inhibition of lymphocyte migration might arise from\nreduction in migration through the endothelial monolayer\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n100\nAdhesion\nMigration\nProlonged culture\nN\neu\ntro\nph\nil a\ndh\nes\nio\nn \n(%\n)\nN\neu\ntro\nph\nil m\nig\nra\ntio\nn \n(%\n)\nN\neu\ntro\nph\nil m\nig\nra\ntio\nn \n(%\n)\nUntreated\nTNF\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nNone Dermal Synovial\nNone Dermal Synovial\nNone Dermal\nFibroblast in co-culture\nSynovial\nFigure 1.

To evaluate\nthese possibilities, we directly observed recruitment from\nflow. As expected, few flowing PBL bound to unstimu-\nlated EC, and cytokine-treatment greatly increased adhe-\nsion to monocultures (Fig. 4a). Surprisingly, co-culture\nwith either dermal or synovial fibroblasts ablated lympho-\ncyte adhesion to EC whether treated with TNF-a + IFN-c\nor not (Fig. 4a). Similar loss of binding was observed for\nco-cultures treated with TNF-a alone (data not shown).\nWe did not detect such dramatic loss of attachment when\nessentially identical co-cultures were formed on opposite\nsides of 0\u00024-lm pore filters,8 suggesting that cell\u2013cell con-\ntact may have been a critical determinant of the behav-\niour of the endothelial monolayer. Direct microscopic\nobservations did not reveal disruption of the endothelial\nmonolayers in co-cultures, whose appearance was identi-\ncal to those in co-cultures that had supported efficient\nneutrophil adhesion and migration. Observations of EC\nor fibroblast mono-cultures did indicate that a few cells\nof either type could cross the 3-lm pore filters in 24 hr.\nTo test whether prior stabilization of the endothelial\nmonolayer might alter the effect of fibroblasts, EC were\ncultured on the 3-lm pore filters for 4 days before seed-\ning with fibroblasts. However, the recruitment of flowing\nPBL was still dramatically reduced by co-culture with der-\nmal or synovial fibroblasts (Fig. 4b).\nMechanism of inhibition of lymphocyte\nrecruitment \u2013 role of soluble mediators\nWe tested whether soluble mediators released by fibro-\nblasts alone or in co-culture could inhibit lymphocyte\nrecruitment from flow. Conditioned medium from\nunstimulated fibroblasts or from co-cultures with EC was\ntransferred to a separate endothelial monolayer, and\nTNF-a + IFN-c was added for 24 hr. The conditioned\nmedia did not reduce the adhesion of flowing lympho-\ncytes compared with standard culture medium (Fig. 5a).\nHence, agents released by unstimulated fibroblasts or\nco-cultures did not inhibit the subsequent response of EC\nto the cytokines. Alternatively, conditioned medium from\ncytokine-treated EC cultured alone or with fibroblasts was\ntransferred to a separate endothelial monolayer for 24 hr.\nOnce again, lymphocyte adhesion was similar with these\nmedia to that obtained with fresh medium with cytokines\nadded (Fig. 5b). The conditioned medium from cytokine-\ntreated cultures was itself fully stimulatory. It seems,\ntherefore, that suppression of lymphocyte adhesion to\nco-cultures did not arise from freely diffusing, released\nsoluble mediator(s).\nMechanism of inhibition of lymphocyte recruitment \u2013\nexpression of adhesion receptors and chemokines by\nEC\nWe previously reported that adhesion of flowing lympho-\ncytes to EC that had been treated with TNF-a + IFN-c was\nmainly supported through a4b1-integrins binding to\nVCAM-1 on the EC, with a contribution from E-selectin;\nstabilization of this attachment required activation of lym-\nphocytes through CXCR3 binding its ligands (CXCL9,\nCXCL10 and\/or CXCL11).8 Using qPCR, we found that\nco-culture had no significant effect on mRNA levels for E-\nselectin, and tended to increase mRNA for VCAM-1 for EC\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n2000\n1500\nAd\nhe\nre\nnt\n n\neu\ntro\nph\nil\n(m\nm2\n\/1\n06\n \npe\nrfu\nse\nd)\nAd\nhe\nre\nnt\n n\neu\ntro\nph\nils\n (%\n)\nM\nig\nra\nte\nd \nne\nut\nro\nph\nils\n (%\n)\n1000\n500\n0\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nNone\nRolling Stationary Migrated\nBehaviour\nAbove filter Beneath filter\nLocation\nNone\nDermal\nDermal\nFibroblast in co-culture\nSynovial\nSynovial\nNone\nDermal\nSynovial\nFigure 2.

As judged by flow\ncytometry, surface expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1\non the EC was not significantly different for cytokine-trea-\nted EC cultured alone or with fibroblasts (Fig. 6c,d). The\nRT-PCR for the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10 and\nCXCL11 showed their up-regulation in EC by the cyto-\nkines, but no difference in levels between EC cultured alone\nor with fibroblasts (data not shown).

This sug-\ngested an inability of the EC to bind exogenous CXCL12\nin the co-culture system. In general, surface-bound\nchemokines are presented by glycoaminoglycans (GAGs)\nwhich, with the exception of hyaluronan, are associated\nwith a protein backbone. Endothelial cells mainly express\nthe GAG heparan sulphate, along with lower levels of hy-\naluronan, chrondroitin sulphate and dermatan sul-\nphate.28\u201331 We therefore investigated whether proteolytic\nenzymes presented by fibroblasts in close contact with EC\nmight be the cause of loss of lymphocyte binding. Prote-\nase inhibitors were added to co-cultures of EC and syno-\nvial fibroblasts grown on the 3\u00020-lm pore filters.\nInhibiting MMP activity (with galardin) caused a partial\nrecovery in lymphocyte recruitment to the cytokine-trea-\nted co-cultures (Fig. 7b), whereas serine protease inhibi-\ntors had no effect. This suggested that loss of MMP-\nsensitive protein structure(s) on the endothelial surface\nduring co-culture contributed to the reduction in lym-\nphocyte adhesion.\n(a) (b)\n1250\nConditioned media from\nunstimulated cultures\nConditioned media from\nTNF + IFN cultures\n1000\n750\n500\n250\n0\nFresh FB-mono\/\nSource of conditioned media\nCo-culture Fresh EC-mono\/\nSource of conditioned media\nCo-culture\nAd\nhe\nre\nnt\n P\nBL\n(m\nm2\n\/1\n06\n \npe\nrfu\nse\nd)\n1250\n1000\n750\n500\n250\n0\nAd\nhe\nre\nnt\n P\nBL\n(m\nm2\n\/1\n06\n \npe\nrfu\nse\nd)\nFigure 5.

McGettrick et al.\nReturning to the co-cultures on 0\u00024-lm pore filters, we\nfurther tested the concept that loss of GAGs could cause\nreduction in the otherwise efficient binding of lympho-\ncytes. Lymphocytes efficiently adhered to cytokine-treated\nEC cultured alone or with synovial fibroblasts on the\nsmall-pore filters (Fig. 7c), in agreement with our recent\nreport.8 Indeed, this cytokine-induced adhesion was sig-\nnificantly inhibited when the co-cultures were treated\nwith heparinase (Fig. 7c). Treatment with hyaluronidase\ndid not modify adhesion (data not shown).\nOverall, the above findings suggest that impaired pre-\nsentation of chemokines by GAGs, brought about through\nproteolytic cleavage of support structures, resulted in loss\nof binding of lymphocytes when fibroblasts were cultured\nin close contact with EC. Separation of the cells by 0\u00024-\nlm pore filters was sufficient to nullify this phenomenon,\nwhich could not be reproduced by soluble mediators\nreleased by the various cultures tested.\nMigration of lymphocytes through EC cultured with\nfibroblasts without contact\nThe question of whether dermal or synovial fibroblasts\naffect lymphocyte migration in the absence of close con-\ntact with EC, could not be answered using the above\nmodels. We therefore developed a model in which EC on\n24-well, 3-lm pore filters were inserted above fibroblasts\non 12-well inserts, leaving a small space between the cells.\nUnder these conditions, fibroblasts increased adhesion of\nCD4+ or CD8+ T cells to the EC and markedly increased\nthe migration of T cells through EC, with or without\ntreatment with cytokines (Fig. 8c,d).\nFibroblasts are known to secrete CXCL12,32\u201334 and we\nrecently demonstrated a role for this chemokine in the\nrecruitment of flowing lymphocytes to EC cultured with\nsynovial fibroblast.8 We therefore considered whether\nmigration was increased by the presence of this chemoki-\nne in the sub-endothelial compartment in co-cultures.\nHowever, inhibition of its receptor CXCR4 on lympho-\ncytes did not inhibit the increase in migration induced by\nco-culture of EC with fibroblasts (Fig. 9a,b). Furthermore\nneutralization of IL-6 during co-culture had no effect on\nthe increase in T-cell migration induced by fibroblasts\n(Fig. 9c,d). Consequently, fibroblasts could promote leu-\ncocyte migration away from the endothelium, but the\nmechanism(s) remain uncertain.\nDiscussion\nEfficient migration of leucocytes into tissue may require\nmore than a single migratory or chemotactic signal. We\nhave found that TNF-a-treated endothelial cells alone\ncan sequentially present CXC-chemokines and lipid\nmediators to induce immobilization and transendothelial\nand onward migration of neutrophils.2,3 On the other\nhand, although lymphocytes readily adhere to and\nmigrate through cytokine-treated EC, many migrate back\nand forth across the monolayer and onward migration is\nmuch less efficient.7 Here, we set out to investigate\nwhether fibroblasts could provide additional migratory\nsignals for leucocytes, and especially make lymphocyte\nmigration more effective.

In\ncontrast, neutrophil adhesion and migration remained\nfully effective in essentially identical co-cultures. Indeed,\nfibroblasts tended to increase the migration of neutroph-\nils away from the sub-endothelial compartment. Inhibi-\ntion of lymphocyte adhesion was not observed if the\ncells were cultured on either side of smaller pore (0\u00024-\nlm) filters. Moreover, if the EC and fibroblasts were\ncultured on separate 3-lm pore filters close together,\nfibroblasts promoted transendothelial and onward migra-\ntion of lymphocytes through the supporting filter.\nHence, stromal cells can powerfully influence the ability\nof vascular EC to recruit flowing leucocytes and direct\ntheir onward migration, with effects dependent on their\nproximity.\nThe suppressive effects arising from close contact with\nfibroblasts could not be reproduced by transferable solu-\nble mediators generated by resting or stimulated mono-\ncultures or co-cultures, and were similar for both dermal\nand synovial fibroblasts. Suppression could not be attrib-\nuted to gross disruption of the endothelial monolayer,\nwhich appeared undisturbed and was able to support effi-\ncient adhesion and migration of neutrophils. The leuco-\ncyte specificity suggested that fibroblasts selectively\nmodified endothelial expression of lymphocyte adhesion\nreceptors and\/or chemokine ligands. Previously we dem-\nonstrated that cytokine-induced lymphocyte adhesion to\nendothelium was mediated through VCAM-1 and E-selec-\ntin.8 However, here, fibroblasts did not cause loss of\nendothelial expression of these adhesion receptors at\nmRNA or protein levels. In addition, we and others\nshowed the importance of CXCR3 ligands in the stabiliza-\ntion of lymphocyte adhesion to endothelium in cytokine-\ndriven models.5,8,35 Here, we found that cytokine-induced\nup-regulation of the CXCR3-ligands CXCL9, CXCL10\nand CXCL11 was not reduced by co-culture with fibro-\nblasts. Our earlier work with inflammatory synovial fibro-\nblasts and EC cultured on opposite sides of 0\u00024-lm pore\nfilters, indicated that endothelial presentation of fibro-\nblast-derived CXCL12 was required for stable lymphocyte\nadhesion.8 In the present study, EC cultured in close\nproximity with these same cells did not support adhesion\nfrom flow. The foregoing suggested to us that, if close\ncontact with fibroblasts impaired the ability of EC to\npresent (rather than generate) chemokines, this could\nexplain the phenomena observed.\n40\nCD4 adhesion\nCD4 migration CD8 migration\nCD8 adhesion\nAd\nhe\nsio\nn\n(%\n of\n ce\nlls\n ad\nde\nd)\n30\n** **\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n** **\n* *20\n10\n0\nM\nig\nra\ntio\nn\n(%\n of\n ce\nlls\n ad\nde\nd)\n30\n20\n10\n0\nM\nig\nra\ntio\nn\n(%\n of\n ce\nlls\n ad\nde\nd)\n30\n20\n10\n0\n40\nAd\nhe\nsio\nn\n(%\n of\n ce\nlls\n ad\nde\nd)\n30\n20\n10\n0\nUntreated\nTNF + IFN\nUntreated\nTNF + IFN\nNone Dermal Synovial\nFibroblast in co-culture\nNone Dermal Synovial\nFibroblast in co-culture\nNone Dermal Synovial\nFibroblast in co-culture\nNone Dermal Synovial\nFibroblast in co-culture\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 8.

Pre-loading endothelial\nmonolayers with exogenous chemokines has been a strat-\negy employed to examine their ability to induce lympho-\ncyte migration.6,42,43 For example, incubation of\nendothelial monolayers with CXCL12 was reported to\npromote transendothelial migration of lymphocytes in the\npresence of flow.6 Here, pre-treatment of EC mono-cul-\ntures with CXCL12 did enhance the adhesion of flowing\nlymphocytes, but did not increase lymphocyte adhesion\nto EC, which had been cultured in close contact with\nfibroblasts. This showed that we could not re-establish\nrecruitment simply by adding back or substituting a miss-\ning chemokine, and supported the concept of impaired\nability of the EC to present chemokines.\nSurface-bound chemokines are mainly presented by\nGAGs which are themselves attached to a protein back-\nbone (i.e. proteoglycans; reviewed in refs 31,44,45). For this\nreason, we considered whether cleavage of GAGs or of\ntheir support structures by fibroblasts might explain loss\nof lymphocyte adhesion. Although released soluble\nenzymes could not have been responsible for the loss of\npresentation (judging from the lack of effect of the vari-\nous culture supernatants), direct contact with fibroblasts\n(some of which may have reached across and indeed\nmigrated through the 3\u00020-lm pore filters) could have\ninduced cleavage. There is a precedent for proteolysis of\nthe proteoglycan backbone by members of the MMP or\nADAM family influencing leucocyte recruitment in vivo.46\nFor example, MMP7-induced shedding of epithelial synd-\necan-1 was reported to generate a chemotactic gradient\nwithin the peri-vascular space inducing neutrophil migra-\ntion into inflamed murine lungs.47 Furthermore, pharma-\ncological inhibition of MMP9 attenuated murine\nneutrophil and CD4 T-cell migration following hepatic\nischaemic\u2013reperfusion injury.48 Here we found that addi-\ntion of galardin to co-cultures (a broad spectrum inhibi-\ntor of MMPs and some ADAM family members)\nsignificantly reduced the ability of fibroblasts to inhibit\nlymphocyte attachment. In contrast, neither a1-antitrypsin\nnor aprotinin (a serine-protease inhibitor) had any effects\non the co-cultures.\nWe also sought evidence of whether GAGs were neces-\nsary for effective lymphocyte adhesion from flow in our\n\u2018undisturbed\u2019 model. Endothelial cells mainly express the\nGAG heparan sulphate, along with lower levels of hyaluro-\nnan, chrondroitin sulphate and dermatan sulphate.28\u201331\nHere, heparinase treatment of cytokine-treated EC cul-\ntured with synovial fibroblast without close contact\nreduced lymphocyte adhesion. Hyaluronidase treatment\nhad no effect.

Effects of inhibiting actions of CXCL12 or interleukin-6 (IL-6) on migration of T cells through cytokine-treated co-cultures in a two-\nfilter static model. Co-cultures were established by inserting an endothelial-coated 24-well filter into a fibroblast-coated 12-well filter. Cells were\ncultured together for 24 hr and then with tumour necrosis factor-a plus interferon-c (TNF + IFN) for a further 24 hr. In (a) and (b), peripheral\nblood lymphocytes were untreated or treated with the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 for 30 min before the assay. In (c) and (d), neutralizing anti-\nbody against IL-6 was added upon establishment of co-culture and was present throughout cytokine-treatment. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell migration\nwas assessed at 24 hr by flow cytometry and expressed as a percentage of cells added. Data are the mean \u00b1 SEM from two (a\u2013b) or three (c\u2013d)\nindependent experiments.\n\u0002 2010 The Authors. Journal Compilation \u0002 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Immunology 11\nModulation of leucocyte migration by fibroblasts\nthat heparinase treatment did not inhibit neutrophil adhe-\nsion to EC treated with TNF-a.31 Hence, disruption of the\nglycocalyx mimicked the effect of close contact with fibro-\nblasts, inhibiting lymphocyte but not neutrophil binding.\nThis is consistent with a previous report that the inhibi-\ntion of interaction of CXCR3 ligands with heparan sul-\nphate suppressed recruitment of CD4 T cells.49\nAs noted above, the differential effects of fibroblasts on\nstable adhesion of lymphocytes and neutrophils could\narise from the cells different requirements for chemokine\npresentation. In addition to GAGs, inflammatory chemo-\nkines can be presented on the endothelial surface by\nDARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) (reviewed\nin ref. 50), which is insensitive to heparinase treatment.51\nPreviously we reported that CXCL5 (ENA-78) was pre-\nsented by DARC to induce neutrophil binding to EC cul-\ntured with synovial fibroblasts.17 Overall, it therefore\nappears that close contact with fibroblasts may cleave\nstructures required for chemokine presentation to lym-\nphocytes but not to neutrophils.\nOur original purpose was to investigate whether fibro-\nblasts could actually promote sub-endothelial migration of\nleucocytes, especially lymphocytes. Recently, we showed\nthat migrating lymphocytes, but not neutrophils, tended to\nbe retained by EC and proposed that a separate signal was\nrequired to induce lymphocyte migration into the stroma.7\nWe also found that different types of fibroblasts, when co-\ncultured with EC without direct contact, could enhance or\ninhibit the stable attachment of flowing lymphocytes,\ndepending on the origin of the fibroblasts.8 This left open\nthe question of whether fibroblasts could provide signals(s)\nto release lymphocytes from the confines of the endothe-\nlium or direct their onward migration. Here we used a\nmodified model with EC and fibroblasts cultured on sepa-\nrate 3-lm pore filters one immediately above the other, to\ninvestigate this possibility. Indeed, both dermal and syno-\nvial fibroblasts promoted T-cell migration through EC and\nits supporting filter. In a previous report, scleroderma fi-\nbroblasts promoted Jurkat migration through an endothe-\nlial cell line, through supply of CCL2 (MCP-1).12 A variety\nof chemokines have been identified as playing roles in lym-\nphocyte migration into inflamed tissues.52\u201358 Here, the\nmost obvious pro-migratory agent shown to be released by\nthe same fibroblasts in our earlier work, was CXCL12.8,34\nHowever, neutralization of the receptor for this chemokine\ndid not impair fibroblast-induced migration. Nor did neu-\ntralization of IL-6 have any effect, although this agent was\nimplicated in the capabilities of the fibroblasts to modulate\nthe earlier lymphocyte adhesion stage in co-cultures.8\nThe pathophysiological implications of the foregoing\ndepend on the arrangement of tissue in vivo. In immediate\npost-capillary venules where lymphocyte recruitment is\nbelieved to occur in inflammation, the endothelial cells are\nclosely neighboured by an incomplete covering of pericytes.\nIn slightly larger vessels a layer of smooth muscle cells\nbegins to appear. In normal tissue, fibroblasts are likely to\nbe slightly more remote from the EC, where our results\nsuggest they would provide regulatory signals in the migra-\ntion of neutrophils and especially T cells. However, if tissue\nis disrupted and fibroblasts come into direct contact with\nEC, then recruitment of lymphocytes (but not neutrophils)\nmight be suppressed. The effects of pericytes, which are\nnormally closely juxtaposed to EC on migration, are uncer-\ntain, although it has been suggested that they modify the\nbasement membrane in a manner that facilitates leucocyte\ntransmigration.59 Several studies have reported the capacity\nof pericytes to differentiate into various stromal cell types,\nincluding fibroblasts, implicating them as a potential\nsource (progenitor) for stromal cells.60\u201365 It is possible that\nthey might act like fibroblasts in our model, but distinction\nof the functions of pericyte from fibroblasts is made diffi-\ncult experimentally by the lack of unique, definitive mark-\ners for either (reviewed in ref. 66). Pericyte-specific\nmodulation of leucocyte recruitment appears worthy of\nfurther investigation.\nDirect contact between fibroblasts and EC may occur\nin the contexts of dermal tissue injury (wounding) and\nangiogenesis. Several studies have reported the ability of\ndermal microvascular endothelial cells to bind and\nmigrate into dermal fibroblast cultures forming tubule-\nlike structures, whereas the fibroblasts themselves enhance\nand sustain microvessel formation.67\u201370 Our findings\nwhen fibroblasts and EC were brought into close contact\ntally with the observed early recruitment of neutrophils\ninto wounds without obvious lymphocyte infiltration.71\nThe same might apply to tissue undergoing neovascular-\nization in chronic inflammatory conditions, or during\ndisorganized growth of vessels in tumours. Under these\nconditions, a restricted or aberrant form of leucocyte\ninfiltration might prevail until a sufficient remodelling\nhas occurred. However, if there was a failure to establish\nnormal architecture, recruitment might continue to differ\nfrom the pattern found in normal resolving inflammatory\nresponses, e.g. the concept of \u2018dissonant orchestration\u2019\ndescribing the inability of leucocytes to infiltrate tumours\nin the accepted sequence.72 Stromal architecture also\nbecomes dramatically disrupted and\/or reorganized in\nchronically inflamed tissues. A good example of this is\nthe invasive migration of synovial fibroblasts into the inti-\nmal space neighbouring the vascular supply of the rheu-\nmatoid joint.73 The proximity of stromal cells to the local\nmicrovasculature may change dynamically during tissue\nrepair, angiogenesis and chronic inflammation, and this\nmay profoundly modulate leucocyte recruitment.\nOverall, the current and previous studies8,16,17 suggest\nthat stromal fibroblasts can influence both early and late\nsteps in transendothelial recruitment of leucocytes. For\nlymphocytes, it is attractive to propose that fibroblasts\nmight provide an additional regulatory step in the migra-\ntion of T cells, which is not so important for neutrophils.\n12 \u0002 2010 The Authors.

McGettrick et al.\nHence, EC exposed to cytokines are able to capture both\ntypes of flowing leucocytes, but can induce efficient\nonward migration of neutrophils only. Fibroblasts appear\nable to provide the signal for onward migration of lym-\nphocytes. An exciting possibility worthy of further investi-\ngation is that such signal(s), arising from different\nfibroblasts in different tissues, might be sub-set specific.\nThis would enable the selective migration of discrete pop-\nulations initially recruited by the less-specific adhesive\ninteraction with the endothelial surface.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by grants from The Wellcome\nTrust grant number 077828 and 088630 and the Arthritis\nResearch Council.
