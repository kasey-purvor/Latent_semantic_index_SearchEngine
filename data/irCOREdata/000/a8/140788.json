By splitting the\nyear in half, seasonal fluctuations are taken into account,\nensuring that periods of typical hungry\/high infection\nand harvest\/low infection, were clearly included in the\nright category. In the absence of overt droughts which\nare rare in The Gambia, this categorization is considered\nsufficient safeguard for possible year to year variations\nof the seasons. Follow up studies revealed an association\nbetween enhanced thymic function and being born in\nthe harvest\/low infection season for 8 week old infants\n[3]. This suggests that seasonal variation in nutrition\nsupplies and infectious diseases may modulate immunity\nthrough the thymus from early in life; potentially\n* Correspondence: tngom@mrc.gm\n1Nutrition Programme, MRC Laboratories, The Gambia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nNgom et al.

In 2-59 month old children, plasmo-\ndium falciparum specific IgG antibody responses are\ncompromised in the malnourished[7]. Single micronutri-\nent deficiency, for example of zinc, has been associated\nwith poor pneumonia outcome, improved by zinc sup-\nplementation[8]. Selenium deficiency is associated with\nmyocardial infarction caused by coxsackie B virus which\nis inhibited by selenium;[9] and selenium supplementa-\ntion also reverses the symptoms of AIDS,[10] in which\nselenium deficiency is common[11,12]. Vitamin D defi-\nciency also spells poor innate immunity through modu-\nlation of neutrophil and macrophage function; and\nvitamin D status is associated with respiratory illness\nand risk of TB[13,14]. Thymic atrophy characterises diet\ninduced malnutrition in mice;[15] and the administra-\ntion of the satiety hormone, leptin which acts via the\nnutritional-status-sensitive[16] hypothalamic-pituitary-\nadrenal axis, has been shown to reverse starvation\ninduced thymic involution[15]. The thymus is also a tar-\nget for disease causing pathogens, and the exposure of\nmice to plasmodium berghei, resulted in invasion of the\nthymus by day 14; accompanied by severe thymic atro-\nphy[17].\nIn humans, postmortem studies show thymic involu-\ntion in the severely malnourished[18]. Furthermore,\ncytokines including IL-7 and IL-2 which are important\nfor thymic and T cell development may be suppressed\nby changes in the thymus[19,20]. In children, reduced\nCD4+CD62L- and CD8+CD28-effector T cells in the\nhealthy as well as the malnourished-infected, compared\nto the well-nourished-infected are seen[21]. The human\nthymus is also vulnerable to infections, and thymic size\nwas significantly decreased in children infected with\nHIV[22]. Reports show that a smaller thymus was a con-\nsistent and independent risk factor for mortality and was\npredictive of immune competence[23,24].\nOur original analysis of mortality by season of birth\nrevealed the surprising observation that the Kaplan-\nMeier survival curves only started to diverge in adoles-\ncence[2] suggesting that any initial deficits in immuno-\nlogical endowment are magnified by an accelerated\nimmunosenescence and only fall below the protective\nthreshold in early adulthood. To test this possibility we\nrecruited two groups of young adults (18-23 y) born in\nthe hungry\/high infection and harvest\/low infection and,\nbased on the known susceptibility of the thymus to\nnutritional insult and our previous evidence for early-life\neffects[3]. We investigated T cell numbers, sjTRECs, T-\ncell repertoire and telomere lengths. We assumed\nchronic and seasonal nutritional deprivation existed,\npartly because of the low dietary intake and the hungry\/\nhigh infection and harvest\/low infection seasonal cycles\nof weight lost and gain observed for the past decades\n[25]. Growth was also reported to deteriorate in infants\nduring the hungry\/high infection [26] accompanied by\nserious depletion of staple foods. Infections including\nmalaria and diarrhea are endemic here, with the highest\nprevalence in the hungry\/high infection season[27-29].\nThe current study of young adults exposed both at\nbirth and repeatedly for the years leading to adoles-\ncence, presents a natural human experimental model\nwhich could be exploited for the characterisation of the\nimmunological mechanisms underlying the effects of\nseasonal fluctuations as well as chronic, nutritional\ndeprivation and infectious burden. Subsistence cultiva-\ntion of crops for food, practised in this community, is\nconsistent with a chronic lack of adequate nutrition.\nFurthermore, farming here is limited to the annual\nrains. Consequently staple food supplies are depleted for\nmuch of the year as the produce of the farming season\nis exhausted before the next crop matures; this occurs\namidst heavy manual labour from the early teenage\nyears, probably worsening overall nutritional\/energy sta-\ntus, with environmental conditions conducive to the\npropagation of infections. We predict that the exposure\nof both the mothers and their fetuses during pregnancy,\nand of their babies after birth, to deprivation and infec-\ntious burden may have a synergistic effect on the matur-\ning immune system and long term health of those born\nduring the hungry\/high infection season. Therefore the\noverall effect is that residents are under both a general\nand chronic (brought about by the limitations of subsis-\ntence farming and the repeated annual cycles, endured\nfrom early life through to adolescence), as well as a sea-\nsonally differential risk of nutritional deprivation and\ninfectious burden. We report suggestions that aspects of\nadult T cell immunity may be under the influence of\nearly life stressors.\nMethods\nA prospective cohort study of 60 overtly healthy 18-23\nyear (average age 21.3 y, SD 2.0 y) old men living in\nrural village community clusters, born in the hungry\/\nhigh infection (n = 30; average age 21.1 y, SD 1.9 y) or\nharvest\/low infection (n = 30; average age 21.5 y, SD 2.2\ny) season, was conducted. Thirty milliliters venous\nblood was taken following signed informed consent\nfrom each participant. Ethical approval was granted by\nthe joint MRC and Gambian Government Ethics Com-\nmittee (Reference number SCC 863).\nLymphocyte subset analysis\nLymphocyte subsets were evaluated by flowcytometry\nusing the FACsCalibur [Becton Dickinson UK Ltd,\nNgom et al. Journal of Biomedical Science 2011, 18:41\nhttp:\/\/www.jbiomedsci.com\/content\/18\/1\/41\nPage 2 of 11\nOxford, UK] following monoclonal antibody staining.\nBriefly, 100 \u03bcl whole blood was incubated with 10 l\nmonoclonal antibodies including anti-CD4+, CD8+ or\nCD3+ [Cyto-stat, Beckman Coulter S.A, Nyon Switzer-\nland]. The red blood cells were lysed and the white\nblood cells fixed and stabilized [Q-prep Beckman, Coul-\nter] then stored at +4\u00b0C prior to transportation on ice\nto the base laboratory for analysis.\nCD4+ and CD8+ cell selection and Triazol treatment\nPBMCs were separated by ficoll gradient centrifugation\nfollowed by positive selection of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells\nusing magnetic beads [MACS columns, Miltenyi Biotec],\nthen spun at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellet was re-\nsuspended in 1 ml Triazol reagent (SIGMA), then store\nat -80\u00b0C until use.\nDNA\/RNA extraction and cDNA generation\nThe Triazol treated samples were thawed and 1 ml\nmixed with 0.2 ml chloroform followed by centrifuga-\ntion at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes to separate into an\naqueous RNA phase, an organic protein layer and a\nDNA interphase.\nRNA was extracted by adding 0.5 ml isopropanol to\nthe aqueous phase and incubating at-20\u00b0C overnight,\nthen centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes. The\nresulting RNA pellet was washed in 1 ml of 75% etha-\nnol, dried on ice for 5-10 minutes then rehydrated in 10\n\u03bcl sterile water. cDNA was generated by RT PCR using\noligo dT primers.\nDNA was extracted by mixing the inter phase with 0.3\nml of 100% ethanol, then centrifuged at 9000 rpm for\n10 minutes and the pellet washed twice in 1 ml of 0.1\nM sodium citrate containing 10% ethanol; followed by 1\nml of 70% ethanol. The DNA pellet was dried and rehy-\ndrated in 100 \u03bcl sterile water, then DNA concentration\ndetermined by spectrophotometry.\nSignal joint (sj) T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement\nexcision circles (TREC) analysis The sjTREC assay has\nbeen previously described in detail[3]. Briefly: 2 \u03bcl of\nDNA from standards and samples were added to 18 \u03bcl\nof master mix containing 0.3 \u03bcM of sjTREC specific for-\nward: GCCACATCCCTTTCAACCATGCTGAC and\nreverse: TTGCTCCGTGGTCTGTGCTGGCATC pri-\nmers, 5 mM MgCl2, 200 ng\/\u03bcl BSA or 0.01% Tween 20\nto give a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcl. The reactions\nwere then transferred into glass capillary tubes for real\ntime PCR quantification of sjTRECs, using the Light\nCycler. The conditions for the real time PCR were as\nfollows: 1 cycle of 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes for Taq polymer-\nase activation, followed by 40-60 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1\nsecond; annealing at 62\u00b0C for 25 seconds; amplification\nat 72\u00b0C for 12 seconds and measurement of fluorescence\nemitted from product at 85\u00b0C for 5 seconds. A cloned\nsjTREC fragment of known concentration was used as\nstandard and could also serve as a positive control.\nSterile distilled water was included in each reaction to\nserve as a negative control.\nExpressed TCRVb repertoire\nThe lack of abnormal clonal expansion for the CD4+\nTCRVb repertoire reported by others, [[30], and [31]]\nprompted us to restrict the repertoire analysis to the\nCD8+ TCRVb. Following RA extraction and reverse-\ntranscription to cDNA, products of the first round PCR\ngenerated using the 24 TCRVb and TCRCb primers (24\nreactions per T cell subset per subject) were confirmed\non agarose gel to be of the expected CDR3 lengths, ran-\nging from 100 bp to 400 bp[32]. Following this confir-\nmation and labelling of DNA products with fluorescent\nsequencing dye, the CDR3 length distribution of the T\ncell clones within each of the 24 TCRVb types were\ndetermined by spectra typing using a gene scanning\napproach[32]. T cell TCRVb repertoire assay is\ndescribed in detail elsewhere[32]. Briefly, 24 TCRVb and\none TCRCb specific primers were used to amplify\ncDNA corresponding to amino acid residues 95-106 of\nthe TCRVb CDR3 region. The product was labeled with\na 5\u2019FAM dye conjugated TCRCb specific primer. The\nproduct was scanned using an ABI PRISM \u00ae 310\nsequencer (GMI, Inc USA); to generate a spectra type of\npeaks representing the different T cell clones in each\nsample.\nTelomere length estimation\nThe telomere length assay is based on the method by\nCawthon et al[33]. Briefly, commercially obtained telo-\nmere specific primers; CGGTTTGTTTGGGTTTGG\nGTTTGGGTTTGGGTTTGGGTT (forward) and GGC\nTTGCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACC\nCT (reverse), were used to amplify telomeric DNA in\nthe CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subset. Six serial dilutions of\nstandards containing telomeric DNA of known concen-\ntration were prepared by doubling dilution. Sample\nDNA and standard were then placed in 0.2 \u03bcl tubes and\nheated at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and then snap chilled on\nice for \u22655 minutes. Real time PCR reactions were set up\nas follows: A master mix made by adding 10 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7\nQuantiTect mix [Qiagen, UK], 250 nM each of the telo-\nmere primer pairs 1% DMSO for increased primer bind-\ning specificity and 2.5 mM DTT for increased Taq DNA\npolymerase enzyme fidelity. Then 2 \u03bcl of sample DNA\ncontaining 35 ng, was added to 18\u03bcl master mix then\ntransferred to glass capillaries for the real time PCR ana-\nlyses. Optimal PCR conditions were achieved at 1 cycle\nof 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes initial denaturation, followed by\n35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds denaturation; 54\u00b0C for\n40 seconds simultaneous primer annealing and exten-\nsion followed by 1 cycle of 65\u00b0C for 5 seconds fluores-\ncence measurement.

The smaller the Ct the more telomere\nrepeat sequences, hence the longer the telomere in the\nstarting DNA sample.\nStatistical analysis\nFor the T cell repertoire analysis, the Kolmogorov Smir-\nnov test was used to assess variation in the distribution\nof T cell clones within the population. For the season of\nbirth analyses, means were compared for those born in\nthe hungry\/high infection season versus those born in\nthe harvest\/low infection season. For normally distribu-\nted data, the Student\u2019s t test was used, and for skewed\ndata, log transformation was applied and the Man Whit-\nney U test used and geometric means (GM) given. P <\n0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe mean birth weight of the population was 3.07 Kg,\nranging from 1.64-3.65 Kg. There were only 2 subjects\nwith low birth weight (<2.5 kg). To evaluate the effects\nof high or low birth weight as indicators of nutritional\nstatus, we categorized by birth weight above (high) or\nbelow (low) the population median, and subjected the\ndata to analyses of co-variance; but there were no over-\nall differences in birth weight effects (data not shown).\nThymic output and T cell subsets in the population\nThe thymic output, repertoire and telomere length\nanalyses were based on CD4+ and CD8+ sorted cells\nwith purity of at least 90%. Of the 60 subjects included,\n56 (27 hungry\/high infection and 29 harvest\/low infec-\ntion) CD4+ T cell and 59 (29 hungry\/high infection and\n30 harvest\/low infection) CD8+ T cell samples had com-\nplete sjTREC data. Samples from 4 of the CD4+ and 1\nfrom the CD8+ subset could not be analysed for\nsjTRECs due to poor sample quality and therefore were\nexcluded.\nAs a molecular marker of thymic output, sjTRECs\nconcentrations in peripheral blood samples were used to\nevaluate thymic function. Mean sjTREC level for the\nCD4+ T cell subset was approximately 1.5 fold higher\nthan for the CD8+ T cell subset, reflecting a CD4+:CD8+\nproduction ratio of approximately 1.5 Table 1). How-\never, the difference was not statistically significant. The\nresults also showed that sjTREC levels of neither the\nCD4+ nor the CD8+ T cell subsets differed significantly\nby season of birth (Table 1).\nSince thymic output influences peripheral T cell num-\nbers, the major peripheral T cell subsets were similarly\nanalyzed. All but 2 subjects had complete lymphocyte\ncount data (29 from each season); while 59 (30 hungry\/\nhigh infection and 29 harvest\/low infection) had full\nCD4+ and CD8+ counts. There were 57 (29 hungry\/high\ninfection and 28 harvest\/low infection) subjects with\ncomplete CD3+ counts. There were no significant differ-\nences in the percentage CD4+, CD8+ or CD3+ T cell\nsubsets by season of birth. However, the absolute num-\nbers of CD4+ and CD3+ T cells were significantly lower\nin those born during the hungry\/high infection com-\npared to the harvest\/low infection season (Table 2). The\nCD4+:CD8+ ratio was similar for both harvest\/low infec-\ntion and hungry\/high infection season born, at 1.6 and\n1.5 respectively.\nCD8+ TCRVb size distribution showed extensive repertoire\ndistortion with season of birth effects on TCRVb 12\/24\nCD8+ TCRVb repertoire data was available for 52 sub-\njects, with data from 4 subjects missing from each\ngroup. While the CD8+ T cell subset exhibited extensive\ndistortions (visually) in the spectra types of most of the\n24 TCRVb types analyzed, it emerged from the initial\nanalyses that the CD4+ T cell subset consistently exhib-\nited normal spectra type distributions consequently\nfurther repertoire analysis was limited to the CD8+ T\ncell subset. Although the overall variability in the distri-\nbution of T cell clones assessed by the Kolmogorov\nSmirnoff test, which measures divergence of the distri-\nbution from the expected normal, did not show signifi-\ncant season of birth differences (p < 0.67), effects on\nindividual TCRVb types were observed.\nThe number of CDR3 peaks provides a measure of T\ncell clonal diversity. Peaks representing genuine T cell\nclones were defined as those with fluorescence intensi-\nties above 500, an arbitrary \u2018cut off\u2019 which excluded\nbackground \u2018noise\u2019 fluorescence. Figure 1 shows that the\naverage number of peaks for virtually all 24 TCRVb\ntypes are much lower (<6 per TCRVb) than the 8-10\npeaks seen in healthy adults [32], reflecting oligoclonal\nexpansions characterizing repertoire skewing.

The average telo-\nmere length for the CD8+ subset of those born in the\nhungry\/high infection season was marginally lower than\nfor those born in the harvest\/low infection season, with\nGM Ct values 0.02, versus 0.03, per 100 cells for the\nharvest\/low infection hungry\/high infection seasons\nrespectively, p = 0.05 (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nWe previously showed associations between season-of-\nbirth, thymic size and functional changes during early\ninfancy, with those born during the harvest\/low infec-\ntion season having larger thymi and enhanced T cell\nproduction[3]. To test the hypothesis that these early\nlife events are amplified in adults to reflect the season\nof birth effects on the reported adult mortality,[2] we\nfirst assumed that as infants, the young adults studied\nhere, were exposed to some of the same seasonal pres-\nsures which existed previously, although current\nimprovements in the socioeconomic conditions of\ntoday are consistent with milder environmental pres-\nsures. The improved socioeconomic conditions coupled\nwith the repeated exposure of environmental stressors\nacross the seasons has the potential to obscure pre-\nviously reported season of birth differences[2]. Unlike\nthe earlier findings in the babies, [3] we did not\nobserve season-of-birth associations with thymic out-\nput in the young adults. In addition to the overall\nimprovements in the socioeconomic conditions\nenjoyed today, it is also possible that the cumulative\nimpact of chronic nutritional deprivation and repeated\ninfections over the years leading to adolescence\nobscured season-of-birth differences on thymic output\nTable 3 TCRVb usage, as fluorescence intensity-calculation\nof individual TCRVb types of CD8+ subset in the population\nand by season of birth in 18-23 years old men\nTCRVb Type Mean fluorescence intensityx104\/subject *P value\nAll\n(52)\nHarvest season\n(n = 26)\nHungry season\n(n = 26)\n1 6.4 6.8 6.0 0.59\n2 2.8 3.1 2.6 0.97\n3 6.3 6.6 6.0 0.88\n4 6.4 7.5 5.2 0.41\n5 5.2 5.0 5.2 0.88\n6A 3.8 4.1 3.5 0.30\n6B 4.7 4.5 4.9 0.68\n7 4.1 4.8 3.5 0.27\n8 5.1 4.8 5.9 0.35\n9 4.4 4.0 4.8 0.93\n11 6.4 7.3 5.5 0.22\n12 9.6 11.6 7.6 0.04\n13A 2.4 2.5 2.4 0.98\n13B 3.5 3.8 3.3 1.00\n14 4.2 4.2 4.3 0.94\n15 5.9 6.2 5.5 0.65\n16 5.6 4.9 6.2 0.27\n17 5.2 5.6 4.8 0.54\n18 3.7 3.6 3.8 0.82\n20 3.6 3.5 3.7 0.75\n21 5.6 5.2 6.0 0.36\n22 6.0 6.2 5.7 0.60\n23 4.9 5.0 4.9 0.87\n24 0.3 0.1 0.4 0.03\n*P value are for differences between TCRVb usage by season of birth, with the\nnumber of subjects (n) shown.\nNgom et al.

The hungry\/\nhigh infection season is associated with greater mortal-\nity rates; [1] therefore it is also possible that the worst\naffected individuals died before reaching adolescence\nwhich may be a source of bias. It support of our data,\nthe lower TREC concentrations in the young adults\ncompared to the reports in the babies, [3] are consis-\ntent with reduced thymic output in advancing age[34].\nDespite the lack of season of birth effects on thymic\noutput, lower CD4+ as well as CD3+ counts were asso-\nciated with hungry\/high infection season births. Consid-\nering the central role of CD4+ cells in the immune\nsystem, [35-38] this implies worse immunity for adults\nborn in the hungry\/high infection season. When season\nof collection was controlled for, (i.e. sampling done in a\ndifferent season to the subject\u2019s birth) this did not sig-\nnificantly alter the findings, although sample sizes were\nsubstantially reduced. Nonetheless, 67.9% (38\/56) for the\nCD4+ T cell subset were collected during the hungry\/\nhigh infection season months of July to December,\ntherefore it is possible that the raised CD4+ and CD3+\ncounts for those born in the harvest\/low infection sea-\nson (but had some of their samples collected in the\nhungry\/high infection season) were partly influenced by\nmore peripheral T cell proliferation. Antigenic load\nwhich drives T cell proliferation is higher in the hungry\/\nhigh infection season when infectious burden is heavier;\n[39] and malaria which peaks here during the hungry\/\nhigh infection season, is likely to impose further\nimmune pressure accompanied by changes in T cell\nE\nTC\nR\nV\nEE1\n \nTC\nR\nV\nE2\n \nTC\nR\nV\nE3\n \nTC\nR\nV\nE4\n \nTC\nR\nV\nE5\n \nTC\nR\nV\nE6\nA\nTC\nR\nV\nE6\nB\nTC\nR\nV\nE7\n \nTC\nR\nV\nE8\n \nTC\nR\nV\nE9\n \nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n1\nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n2\nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n3\nA\nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n3\nB\nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n4\nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n5\nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n6\nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n7\nTC\nR\nV\nE1\n8\nTC\nR\nV\nE2\n0\nTC\nR\nV\nE2\n1\nTC\nR\nV\nE2\n2\nTC\nR\nV\nE2\n3\nTC\nR\nV\nE2\n4\n%\n T\nC\nR\nV\nEu\nsa\nge\n.\nFigure 2 Relative CD8+ TCRVb usage by season of birth, in the CD8+ T cell subset.

The percentage CD8+ TCRVb usage for those born in\nhungry\/high infection season (blue bars) and harvest\/low infection season (maroon bars) are shown. While the usage of most TCRVb types did\nnot exceed 5%, TCRVb12 usage was consistently higher than all TCRVb types for both seasons of birth. The near extinction of TCRVb24 is\nmanifested in the near zero usage observed for both seasons of birth. There were 26 subjects each born in the hungry\/high infection or\nharvest\/low infection seasons. If each TCRVb type was used at same frequency, usage would be expected at a frequency of approximately 4%\n(1\/24) [dotted horizontal line], therefore there is an overall high usage; with most (16\/24) showing \u22654% usage.

Further stu-\ndies specifically testing the season of collection are\nneeded to verify this.\nThe lack of season of birth effects on thymic output\nmay reflect its higher tolerance threshold, than the CD4\n+ and CD3+ subsets, which may be more sensitive to\npressures from environmental elements. In support of\nthis, dietary zinc was associated with and differential\nrises of up to 24% and 64% CD4+ and CD3+ lymphocyte\ncounts respectively[42].\nSimilarly to the CD4+ and CD3+ counts, the season of\nbirth effects on specific TCRVb types suggested differ-\nential sensitivities to elements of the environment. The\nreduced usage of TCRVb12 for those born in the hun-\ngry\/high infection season (most of whose samples were\nalso collected in the hungry\/high infection season) may\nbe related to the prevailing infections. HBV infection is\nendemic in this community with 10-15% of adult male\ndeaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma which is asso-\nciated with HBV infection[43] and it has been shown\nthat TCRVb12 is specific for hepatitis B virus (HBV)\ncore antigen[44]. Those born in the hungry\/high infec-\ntion season may be less able to control HBV (particu-\nlarly during the hungry\/high infection season), possibly\nleading to increased liver damage[45]. The season of\nbirth differences observed for the TCRVb24 which is\ndeleted in all but 8 of the 52 subjects all of whom only\nlowly expressed TCRVb24, suggested that TCRVb24\nmay not be of significant value for immune protection\nin either season. It is possible that a \u2018chance\u2019 Type 1 sta-\ntistical error arising from multiple testing of repeated\nvariables may account for the season of birth difference\nseen, and that a bigger sample size may produce signifi-\ncant differences in other TCRVb types.\nRepertoire skewing is consistent with accelerated pro-\nliferation and the potential to drive telomere erosion,\ntherefore the shorter mean telomere length for those\nborn in the hungry\/high infection season suggested that\ntheir CD8+ T cells were under proliferative pressure and\nat a higher risk of replicative senescence. Telomere\nshortening is accelerated in arterial tissue exposed to\noxidative stress factors including reactive oxygen species\n(ROS)[46]. The endemicity of infections in this commu-\nnity may be expected to generate ROS to contribute to\ntelomere shortening especially for those born in the\nhungry\/high infection season.\nTo optimize the interpretation of our TREC findings\nat the population level, results from other study popula-\ntions were used for comparison. The TREC assay which\nis now widely used as a marker of thymic output lacks a\n\u2018gold\u2019 standard; thus limiting the number of studies with\nwhich to compare our data. However, our results sug-\ngested that average TREC concentrations in the subjects\nstudied may be substantially lower than those of adults\nelsewhere, [47,48] implying diminished thymic output\nand immune capacity in this population. Persistent\ninfectious burden rather than low thymic output may\nalso be responsible for the lower TRECs; since elevated\ncell proliferation from antigenic exposure is known to\ndilute TREC concentrations[49]. Our findings, at the\npopulation level, that the T cell subsets are comparable\nto those of healthy individuals from the sub region,\n[50-53] imply that poor T cell immunity may be com-\nmon here. The lack of observable differences arising\nfrom the further analyses by birth weight category\n(higher\/lower than the population median) is consistent\nwith the overall findings but may have been confounded\nby the resultant reductions in numbers.\nOur analyses of the T cell repertoire was meant to\ngive an in depth evaluation of T cell immune status\nbeyond thymic output and T cell numbers, and the\nextensive CD8+ TCRVb repertoire distortions in the\npopulation indicated more severe immune challenges\nthan was evident from the thymic output and T cell\ncounts. Only 2 (TCRVb12 and 15) out of 24 TCRVb\ntypes showed an average spectra-type peak number \u22655\nacross all donors; compared to reports of >8 peaks in\nhealthy individuals[54,55]. We speculate that repertoire\nskewing in this population was driven by environmental\nstressors including the repeated persistent antigenic\nexposure annually and across the seasons due to the\nendemicity of infections [56-58] including CMV, which\nis associated with virus specific CD8+ T cell types and\nother risk factors [59,60]. We argue that the chronic\nnature of the assault on the immune system of both\ngroups may be the reason for the general distortion of\nthe TCRV\u00df repertoire. Significantly, the timing of expo-\nsure to environmental stressors may be more critical,\nthe closer to the time of birth it occurs, as the thymus\nexperiences its greatest and only growth phase in the\nfirst year of life, a period of maximum vulnerability;\nwith the potential to generate ever-lasting impact on the\nthymus and the T cells it generates. Consequently the\nthymi of those born in the hungry\/high infection season\nmay never be adequately compensated to cope with\nlater life demands. Conversely, thymi of those born in\nthe harvest\/low infection in a more enabling environ-\nment for development, may be endowed with a more\nresilient initial thymic capacity. The immune insuffi-\nciency implied by the apparent oligoclonal repertoire\ndistortions is consistent both with the lower thymic out-\nput compared to others;[47,48] and supported by the\nassociation of a polyclonal repertoire with a lack of anti-\ngen exposure,[61] favourable immunity being associated\nwith good thymic output and a broad repertoire[62].\nChronic HBV infection is also endemic in this com-\nmunity,[63] and the publicly expressed TCRVb12 being\nspecific to the HLA-A2 restricted hepatitis B virus\nNgom et al. Journal of Biomedical Science 2011, 18:41\nhttp:\/\/www.jbiomedsci.com\/content\/18\/1\/41\nPage 8 of 11\n(HBV) core antigen[44] supports a role for HBV in the\nmarked global repertoire skewing seen. The near extinc-\ntion of TCRVb24 in the population, which has also been\nreported in other settings, where TCRVb24 became\nnotably expanded when stimulated by specific antigen,\n[61] suggested that the near zero expression in our\nstudy was probably not due to lack of capacity for the\nTCRVb24 clone to expand. This implies that TCRVb24\noffers little, if any, advantages in this community. As\nclonal expansion and cell division are accompanied by\ntelomere erosion,[64,65] the shorter telomere of the\nCD8+ compared to the CD4+ subset, supports reports\nthat the CD8+ subset undergoes faster clonal expansion\n[66]. Indeed shorter mean telomere length has pre-\nviously been reported for the CD8+ compared to the\nCD4+ subset in healthy humans[67] and with increasing\nT cell turnover[65]. A na\u00efve T cell is estimated to go\nthrough at least 14 cell divisions during an immune\nresponse,[68,69] therefore the repeated infections might\nbe expected to drive telomere shortening although\nhuman studies with which to compare our data were\nlacking.\nConclusions\nTaken together, our data showed no definitive link\nbetween adult thymic function and early life effects.\nDespite this, season of birth differences in the CD4+ and\nCD3+ counts as well as CD8+ telomeres, suggest that\naspects of adult T cell immunity may be under the\ninfluence of early life stressors. We also argue that,\nrepeated annual cycles of nutritional deprivation and\ninfectious burden may drive overall CD8+ TCRVb reper-\ntoire skewing possibly related to risk factors including\nCMV and HBV infections. Put together, we propose the\nenvironmental pressures possibly of nutritional origin,\npredispose this population to infections arising from the\nresultant challenges to the immune system.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the subjects who donated blood samples and to the\nNutrition Program staff at Keneba.
