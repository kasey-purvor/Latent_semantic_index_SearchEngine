MTC MRI is normally implemented at a fixed magnetic \nfield; however, it may be useful to evaluate changes of the MT effect as a function of \nexternal magnetic field strength (B0). In order to conduct field-dependent MTC experiments \nwith a single MR system, two techniques are crucially needed. B0 should be able to be \nswitched between levels during irradiation of the MT pulse. At the same time, the resonance \nfrequency of the RF coil (f0) should also be able to be shifted to the corresponding value. \nSwitching B0 is attained by the fast field-cycling technique, while in order to switch f0, a \nspecially designed multi-tunable RF coil is required. Here, we designed and constructed an \nactively frequency-switchable RF coil for frequencies at and below 2.5 MHz. The design \nemployed PIN diodes, and enabled switching f0 between five different values, with excellent \nimpedance matching (approximately \u2013 37 dB S11 reflection) and Q-factor of about 100 at \neach configuration.  \n \n \nKey words: Multi-tunable coil; PIN diode switch; Field cycling; Magnetization Transfer \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nMagnetisation Transfer Contrast (MTC) is a well-established MR contrast-generating \nmechanism, and is widely used for clarifying MR-invisible macromolecular information \nindirectly via MR-detectable free protons using their distinguishable NMR spectral \nlinewidths [1,2]. In general, the restricted macromolecular protons are hardly detected by \nmeans of conventional MR techniques because of their very short T2 relaxation times (few \n\u03bcs) or very broad linewidths (few tens of kHz). MTC MRI is typically implemented by \napplying an off-resonance radiofrequency (RF) irradiation pulse (or MT pulse) before \nacquiring MR data by ordinary MR pulse sequences, in order to irradiate the bound \nmacromolecular protons whilst not affecting directly the free water protons. As a result of the \nMT pulse, magnetisation between both proton pools is exchanged and the signal intensity of \nmobile protons is decreased in relation to the amount of macromolecules. \nThe external magnetic field strength (B0) may play an essential role in developing \nmagnetisation transfer contrast (MTC) imaging methods. MTC is normally employed at a \nfixed magnetic field, so many studies of MTC at medium and high magnetic field (0.5 T and \nabove) have been reported. There is, however, little information in the literature concerning \nthe variation of the MT effect as a function of magnetic field, due to hardware limitations [2-\n4]. In order to explore field-dependent MTC experiments using a single MR instrument, two \nessential techniques are required, which enable simultaneously shifting both external \nmagnetic field (B0) and the resonance frequency of an RF coil (f0) during MT pulse \nirradiation and returning them to the original condition during MR data acquisition, as shown \nin Fig. 1.  \nSwitching of B0 is achieved by fast field-cycling (FFC). FFC is a novel technique \nallowing B0 to shift between levels rapidly during the pulse sequence. This makes it possible \nto perform a number of beneficial field-dependent studies and\/or to provide new MR contrast \nmechanisms [5-7]. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of combining FFC with \nMTC MRI using a new off-resonance irradiation method [8,9]. This technique should also be \ncapable of conducting field-dependent MTC studies.  \nSwitching of f0 requires a multi-tunable RF coil. Previously, this type of coil has been \nbuilt with various approaches. The first strategy to achieve multiple-resonant frequencies was \nto use dual or triple RF coils. Lurie et al. combined a birdcage coil (tuned for \n1\nH frequency) \nwith an orthogonally positioned Alderman-Grant resonator (tuned for electron frequency) to \ndetect free radical distribution via \n1\nH NMR signal using the Overhauser effect at low field [5]. \n 4 \nAugath et al. built a triple-resonant RF coil for \n39\nK, \n23\nNa, and \n1\nH MR imaging of a rat head at \n9.4 T. A saddle coil, a Helmholtz coil, and a printed flat mesh structure coil were respectively \nused to attain each configuration [10]. Their switchable frequencies were, however, limited \nto two (or three) values and coupling between the coils was also problematic. Another \napproach was to adapt a parallel LC trap circuit into a single RF coil. Schnall et al. included \nthe trap circuit in series with the tuning capacitor into a surface coil which provided dual \nresonance frequencies for \n31\nP and \n1\nH NMR experiments at 3.0 T. They suggested that this \nmethod could be extended to more than two frequencies [11]. Similarly, Isaac et al. designed \na low-pass birdcage coil by inserting the trap circuit into its legs in series in order to obtain \nboth \n31\nP and \n1\nH resonance frequencies [12]. Shen et al. also demonstrated a double-tuned \nbirdcage coil based on the method of a parallel trap circuit in order to present \n23\nNa and \n1\nH \nimaging at 1.5 T [13]. This method using the trap circuit could be used to avoid the coupling \neffect but the range of the switchable frequency was still limited. A third method introduced \nby Hwang and Hoult was to adjust tuning and matching capacitors by means of electric \nstepper motors [14]. Alternatively, other researchers have used varactor diodes. The \ncapacitance of the varactor diode increases by increasing an applied reverse-bias voltage. \nTugan Muftuler et al. used varactor diodes to build a low-pass birdcage resonator and \nachieved an automatically double-tunable resonator for \n1\nH and \n19\nF imaging at 3.0 T [15]. de \nAlejo et al. also used varactor diodes in a saddle coil and attained an actively frequency \ncontrollable RF coil for \n1\nH, \n3\nHe, and \n19\nF at 4.7 T [16]. They also addressed the problem that \nthe Q-factor decreased with extending available frequencies. Hirata et al. constructed an \nelectronically tunable surface coil using varactor diodes for tuning and matching systems in \norder to avoid frequency shifting and mismatching problems arising in in-vivo electron spin \nresonance experiments [17]. It may be possible to control tuning and matching for various \nnuclei of interest at high field; however, the frequency-switchable range of the varactor \ndiodes may still be restricted to detect the nuclei at low field due to requiring higher \ncapacitance.  \nIn this work, we present the design and construction of an actively frequency-\nswitchable RF coil employing PIN diodes. PIN diodes are usually used not for switching two \n(or more) different frequencies but for tuning\/detuning RF coils (a PIN diode becomes a \nconductor when forward biased whereas it becomes a high resistance when reverse bias is \napplied) [18,19]. Our design has enabled switching the coil\u2019s resonance frequency between \nfive levels without limitation of the switchable frequency range [20].  \n 5 \nMethods \nA single-solenoid transmit\/receive RF coil was designed and constructed for switchable-\nfrequency operation around 2.5 MHz. This type of coil provided sufficient B1 field strength \nand Q-factor for MTC experiments, and horizontal sample access for use in our vertical-B0 \nFFC-MRI scanner [5]. The coil was 150 mm in diameter and 75 mm in length, wound with \n16 turns of 1.5 mm thick copper wire to avoid the skin depth effect, particularly dominant at \nlow field. The winding density was increased at each end in order to improve B1 field \nhomogeneity. The coil was shielded by a cylinder of 50 \u03bcm copper foil with 300 mm \ndiameter and length. Figs. 2a and 2b show photographs of the RF coil with and without \nshield. \nA capacitive balanced matching network (Fig. 3) was used in order to equilibrate the \ncoil\u2019s potential with respect to the ground leading to reduction of dielectric losses arising \nfrom the capacitive coupling with the sample (smaller frequency shift), and increase of Q-\nfactor. In Fig. 3, Cmatch, Ctune, and Csym are matching, tuning, and symmetric capacitors, \nrespectively. The sum of the values of Cmatch and Ctune needs to be approximately equal to the \ncapacitance (Csym) in order to balance the circuit with good matching. The values of these \ncapacitors were first calculated based on the coil\u2019s inductance (42 \u03bcH measured by means of \na Q-meter (HP 4342A)) and desired resonance frequency (for example, 2.5 MHz). Trimmer \ncapacitors which cover the calculated ranges of requirement were then selected. Two types of \ntrimmer (Voltronics, USA), with capacitance ranges of 1.5 pF to 55 pF and 2 pF to 120 pF, \nwere used. \nIn order to increase the number of available resonance frequencies of the coil (f0), \neach PIN diode circuit (PIN diode itself (Infineon technologies, BAR64-05W) and trimmer \ncapacitor) was attached in parallel with each Ctune and Csym of the balanced RF coil circuit. \nFig. 3 shows the circuit diagram of the RF coil. The attached trimmer capacitors increase the \noverall capacitance of Ctune and Csym and, in turn decrease the coil\u2019s resonance frequency. As \nthe detection field of our system was fixed at 59 mT, 2.5 MHz (corresponding Larmor \nfrequency of 59 mT) was selected as the first frequency of the coil. This first f0 was obtained \neither without attaching any PIN diode circuits or equivalently by attaching but disabling the \nPIN diode circuits in Fig. 3b. The second f0 was adjusted using a set of all the PIN diode \ncircuits (red line) (Fig. 3c) and third (orange lines) (Fig. 3d), fourth (green line) (Fig. 3e), and \nfifth (blue line) (Fig. 3f). Only one set of PIN diode circuits was active at a given time, while \nthe others were in the off-state. Therefore, five different resonance frequencies were attained.  \n 6 \nIn order to operate the PIN diodes, PIN diode drivers providing both forward and reverse bias \nvoltages were required. The designs for these were modified and extended from reference \n[18]. The PIN diode drivers were built and assembled into an aluminium diecast box \n(55\/110\/65 mm in width\/height\/length) as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the circuit diagram \nof two of the PIN diode drivers. These drivers were powered by 9V batteries (one for \nproviding stable + 5V and the others for \u2013 12V) through voltage regulators (LM7805CT and \nL7912ACV). All power sources (+ 5V and \u2013 12V) and ground were shared via each \nconductive spacer. Additional PIN diode drivers can easily be expanded for future \napplications. Activating these drivers is achieved by either manual switches 1 to 4 (for \ntesting) or via TTL pulses from the MR console. For example, if a manual switch (SW 1) or a \nTTL pulse (TTL A) is turned on, NPN transistor (Q1, 2N3904) in Fig. 5 is activated which \nallows current to flow from + 5V to ground and this, in turn, activates PNP transistors (Q2 \nand Q3, 2N3906). Consequently, + 5V is transferred into the PIN diode driver outputs (DC \n(a) and DC (a\u2019)) to enable the pre-determined PIN diode set. On the other hand, if both input \nsignals are switched off, all transistors are inactivated leading to an output of \u2013 12V which \ndisables the PIN diode set.  \nDC and RF were split by homemade RF chokes (few mH) located between the PIN \ndiode and PIN diode driver outputs but closer to the PIN diodes. The RF chokes were about 5 \nto 7 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length, wound with many turns of 5 \u00b5m thick copper wire \nin a plastic holder. A Q-meter (HP4342A) was used to measure the inductance of the RF \nchokes. Even though the RF chokes did not completely block RF (since the maximum \ninductance of RF chokes we could build in-house was approximately 4 mH and above this \nvalue the choke became a capacitor), the frequency shift (few hundreds of Hz) and Q-factor \ndrop (few tens of the value) due to the RF leakage level was acceptable. \nFour TTL channels were available for output from our MR console; however, only \ntwo of these were available for control of the RF coil. In order to double the available TTL \nlines, a TTL pulse divider was also built and assembled into the diecast box. Fig. 6 shows a \ntruth table and logic diagram of the divider. This divider consisted of four AND logic gates \n(DM74LS08) and two Inverting gates (DM74LS04). This figure shows that only one f0 is \nselected at one MT irradiation period.  \nThe FFC-MTC-MRI pulse sequence was written using a C-like programming \nlanguage on our system\u2019s commercial console (SMIS Ltd., UK).  \n 7 \nThe coil was initially evaluated on the bench using a network analyser (Agilent Technologies, \nE5061A). MR imaging experiments were then carried out using a home-built field-cycling \nMRI system that uses a permanent magnet for detection and a co-axial resistive magnet for \nfield-offset [5]. The operating field strength of the permanent magnet is fixed at 58.7 mT and \nsignal detection is always carried out at this field strength. However, the effective B0 during \nother parts of the pulse sequence can be set at any value from zero to approximately 100 mT \nby control from the pulse program.  \nA multi-sample phantom was prepared for the imaging experiments which consisted \nof 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% (w\/v) agarose gel (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) samples. In addition, a \nsample only containing aqueous solution of MnCl2 (without agarose) was used as a control.  \n \nResults \nFig. 7 shows screen-shots of network analyser S11 reflection measurements obtained using \nthe actively frequency-switchable RF coil in five pre-determined configurations: 2.5 MHz, \n2.4 MHz, 2.3 MHz, 2.2 MHz, and 2.1 MHz. The traces have been imported as Excel format. \nThe centre frequency and span of the network analyser screen were fixed to 2.25 MHz and \n0.8 MHz, respectively. The pre-determined resonance frequency values of this resonator \ncould initially be adjusted between 2.5 MHz and 2.0 MHz using the trimmer capacitors. \nThese results in Fig. 7 indicate excellent 50 \u03a9 impedance matching (approximately \u2013 37 dB \nreturn loss) and an unloaded Q-factor of about 100 at each frequency.  \nFig. 8 shows the phantom images acquired with an interleaved (with and without MT \nirradiation) gradient-echo imaging pulse sequence. MT irradiation and signal detection were \nboth performed at 2.5 MHz. The imaging parameters were: 1.5 s repetition time, 20 ms echo \ntime, 180 \u00d7 180 mm field of view, 128 \u00d7 128 pixel image matrix size, 20 mm slice thickness, \nNEX = 8 and the MT pulse parameter conditions were: 7.5 \u00b5T B1, 1.5 kHz offset, and 270 ms \nMT pulse duration. In order to attain the 7.5 \u00b5T B1 level, we have used a commercially \navailable RF amplifier (Marconi Ltd., UK). The typical instantaneous transmit power level \nwas approximately 18 W at the 7.5 \u00b5T B1 level, with a duty cycle of 10%, giving an average \npower in the MT irradiation of 1.8 W. This is shared among 8 PIN diodes, giving an average \npower level of 0.225 W each, which is within the power-handling specification of the \ncomponents used (0.25 W). \n 8 \nIn order to analyse the MT effects, regions of interest within the images were \nmanually selected and magnetisation transfer ratios of each sample were calculated using the \nstandard equation MTR = 1 \u2013 Ms\/M0, where Ms and M0 denote the signal intensities of the \nfree protons measured with and without applying the MT saturation pulse, respectively. The \nMTR images were also acquired by pixel-by-pixel based image processing using MATLAB \n(MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Fig 8a shows the images without and with irradiating the \nMT pulse, and the MTR image (from left to right). Fig. 8b presents the quantified MTR \nvalues calculated using the selected regions of interest from the images of the individual \nsamples. Due to the absence of macromolecules in the control sample, we expected that the \nMT effect would be almost zero, but the frequency of the MT pulse was very close to the \nresonance frequency, so a small direct effect was present. Otherwise, the MT effects of the \nother samples increased with increasing concentration of agarose.  \n \nDiscussion \nWe have demonstrated the design and construction of an automatically frequency-switchable \nRF coil. PIN diodes were used as electronic switches, which were attached in parallel into an \ninitially balanced circuit with trimmer capacitors - one in Ctune and the other in Csym. This \nenabled switching of the resonance frequency of the coil between five values with excellent \nimpedance matching and reasonably high Q-factor. Due to the four inserted PIN diode \ncircuits, the noise level of the coil was approximately doubled compared to that obtained \nwithout the PIN diode circuitry. This increase was mainly incurred by the imperfection of \nblocking the RF leakage via the RF chokes. In this work, we also have shown that the \nswitchable frequency range was within a few hundred kHz at ultra-low field. However, the \nrange can easily be extended by adding fixed capacitors in parallel with the trimmers and this \nhas been tested. In addition, more available frequencies could be attained at the expense of \ndecreasing the Q-factor, which is reduced due to the attachment of additional PIN diode \ncircuits onto the RF coil. \nIn the future, we intend to conduct field-dependent MTC experiments using this coil \nwith optimised MT pulse parameters and employing the FFC technique. In addition to its \napplication for MTC, this design could also find use for multi-nuclear magnetic resonance as \nthe switching time of this resonator is very short (few ns).  \n \n 9 \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors acknowledge financial support for the FFC-MRI project from Research Councils \nUK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, under the Basic \nTechnology scheme (grant number EP\/E036775\/1).
