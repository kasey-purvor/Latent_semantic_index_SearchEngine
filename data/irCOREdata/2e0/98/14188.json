The first paper, by Smith, sets the scene for the remaining papers\nwith its focus on policy and how this may be influenced by rhetoric, and in turn may\ninfluence creativity and innovation. In \u2018From flowers to palms: 40 years of policy for\nonline learning\u2019, Smith presents a review of learning technology-related policy over\nthe past 40 years. The purpose of the review is to make sense of the current position\nin which the field finds itself, and to highlight lessons that can be learned from the\nimplementation of previous policies. Smith concludes: \nThe creativity of the early adopters, who matched tools and resources closely to student\nlearning need \u2026 has been overlooked in more recent strategically intentioned develop-\nments, but current funding may be beginning to redress this balance. Lessons learned\nfrom the demise of the UkeU may signal the end of \u2018big systems\u2019 and a return to inno-\nvation, rather than further sustaining Blunkett\u2019s \u2026 rhetoric of e-learning as economic\nnecessity \u2026\nThe remaining papers in this issue certainly present e-learning as a pedagogic rather\nthan an economic necessity. For example, Creanor and Walker examine the pedagogy\nof transnational online learning from the perspective of communities of practice and\nlearning architectures, while Wheeler, Kelly and Gale explore how a Managed Learn-\ning Environment can be designed to promote problem-based learning and situated\ncognition. In \u2018Learning architectures and negotiation of meaning in European trade\nunions\u2019, Creanor and Walker describes a project that evaluates a European project\nfocused on two key activities: developing a networking strand to support cross-border\nsectoral trade union activities, and developing a computer-mediated distance learning\nfor cross-border trade union education. Out of these developments, new pedagogical\narchitectures and social processes emerged. Creanor and Walker use Wenger\u2019s\nconcept of \u2018communities of practice\u2019 (CoPs) as a framework for discussing their\nevaluation data. They conclude: \nCommunication technologies are vital to the future development of transnational\ncollaboration but, rather than experimenting with cutting edge tools, we would argue\nthat the focus should be on the nuances of the interaction, the role of the \u2018broker\u2019 and\nthe impact of the design. If the development of online learning and CoPs in the trade\nunion sector is to be encouraged, continuing investigation of the emerging pedagogical\nand social processes, and the relationships between them, is essential.\n92 Editorial \nIn \u2018The influence of online problem-based learning on teachers\u2019 professional practice\nand identity\u2019, Wheeler et al. describe the design of a managed learning environment\ncalled MTutor, which is used to teach an online Masters Module for teachers. In\ndescribing the design of MTutor, Wheeler et al. highlight the pedagogic value of\nproblem-based learning (PBL), situated cognition and ill-structured problems: \nTeachers tend to become convinced of the efficacy of the higher cognitive level of\nengagement PBL yields, and often change their style to accommodate it in their own\nprofessional practice. Furthermore, mature, full-time professionals prefer the flexibility\nthat online learning affords, often in spite of the many accompanying problems and\nissues.\nThe papers in this issue may also challenge us to examine what we understand by\ncreativity and innovation in e-learning. For example, the experiences of Bracher,\nCollier, Ottewil and Shepherd suggest that if technologies such as video streaming are\nto be used effectively, traditional roles and structures may need to change, while\nLukusiak, Agosthinho, Bennett, Harper, Lockyer and Powley propose a learning\ndesign framework, which is underpinned by considerations of how to create effective\nlearning experiences. In \u2018Accessing and engaging with video streams for educational\npurposes: experiences, issues and concerns\u2019, Bracher et al. present a case study of\ntheir experiences of using a video with undergraduate and postgraduate health care\nstudents. They reflect on the use of the video before and after it was streamed and\nhighlight key issues of access and engagement. \n\u2026 using streaming media successfully will also require both lecturers and students to\nchange their traditional roles and expectations \u2026 in some respects students will need\nto become more \u2018independent\u2019 but teaching staff will need to work less independently\nas they embrace the practicalities of teamwork.\nIn \u2018Learning objects and learning designs: an integrated system for reusable adaptive\nand shareable learning content\u2019, Lukusiak et al. propose a system, the Smart Design\nLearning Framework, designed to support the development of pedagogically sound\nlearning material within an integrated, platform independent structure. Lukusiak\net al. propose their system as an alternative to what they describe as \u2018pedagogically\nneutral systems\u2019.\nJane Seale\nUniversity of Southampton, UK\n"}
