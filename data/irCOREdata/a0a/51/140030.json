INTRODUCTION \nThe study of mixing structure and intermittent behaviour of a coaxial jet discharging \nfrom a circular inlet to free space is important for many practical engineering \napplications such as aeroacoustic, propulsion and environmental emissions. In \naddition, coaxial jet motion is often used as a mechanism to promote or control \nmixing between a fuel spray jet and the adjacent air for combustion applications, as \nwell as to control the turbulent transport within a jet region. Since coaxial jet mixing \ncan have a profound effect on self-similarity and downstream mixing in applied \nengineering systems, a detailed understanding of the mixing and its inter related \nprocesses such as turbulent intermittency characteristics is beneficial to the design \nprocess. \n \nDuring the past few decades various experimental studies have been carried out to \ninvestigate the characteristics of coaxial jets; mainly focusing on mixing of both \npassive and active scalars, the shear layers between the inner and outer jets, and the \ninfluence of the inlet conditions on mixing properties. Regarding experimental \ninvestigations; Forstall and Shapiro (1951) first studied the effects of different inlet \nvelocity ratios on mixing and concluded that the velocity ratio is more important to \ndetermine the near and far field mixing of coaxial jets. Chigier and Beer (1964) \nstudied the near nozzle flow region in double concentric jets. Ko and Kwan (1971) \nand Kwan and Ko (1977) carried out subsonic coaxial jet studies and divided the near \nfield into different zones, while defining the mixing regions with demonstration of \nsimilarities between coaxial and single jets. Dahm et al. (1992) conducted \ncomprehensive flow visualisation for coaxial jets and found a variety of near field \nvortex patterns.  Buresti et al. (1998) investigated the near field flow properties of \n 3 \ncoaxial jets and demonstrated the relation between inlet wall thickness and vortex \nshedding phenomena. Sadr and Klewicki (2003) also studied the near field flow \ndevelopment in coaxial jets and described the anistropic turbulence structure in the \ninner mixing layer. At the same time a series of intermittency measurements have also \nbeen made for some turbulent jets. For example, Becker et al. (1965) investigated \nscalar intermittency in jets and Wygnanski and Fiedler (1969) obtained intermittency \ndata for a self-preserving high Reynolds number axisymmetric turbulent jet. Bilger et \nal. (1976) also took intermittency experimental data for the temperature field using the \nprobability density function (PDF) approach, while Shefer and Dibble (2001) \ninvestigated intermittency for propane based round jet.   \n \nNumerical investigation of a spatially evolving coaxial turbulent jet has also received \nconsiderable attention.  The continuous development of high performance computing \nand large core memories has facilitated the performance of large scale simulations \nrespecting both spatial and time accuracy.  This has allowed both direct numerical \nsimulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) techniques to be employed \nespecially for more fundamental investigations.  In the DNS all the length and time \nscales of turbulence are directly resolved and hence no turbulence models are \nrequired, but currently this technique is only applicable for relatively low Reynolds \nnumber flows.  In LES only large scales of turbulence are directly computed with the \neffect of the small scales requiring a turbulence model.  \n \nSeveral large scale DNS studies have been carried out for coaxial jet calculations. For \nexample, da Silva and Metais (2001) conducted DNS of the spatially evolving coaxial \nround jets, and da Silve et al. (2003) studied the transition in high velocity ratio \n 4 \ncoaxial jets using DNS. Balarac and Metais (2005) also studied the near field of \ncoaxial jets using DNS and analysed the influence of the inner shear layer for the \nmomentum thickness of jet nozzle. Balarac et al. (2007) further extended their DNS \nwork and simulated the high velocity ratio coaxial jets with various upstream \nconditions. LES is capable of simulating higher Reynolds number flows and hence \nmany jet simulations have been carried out successfully using now affordable \ncomputing power. For example, Akselvoll and Moin (1996) have performed LES \ncalculations of confined coaxial jets and discussed fluid dynamical aspects of \nconfined coaxial jets. Boersma and Lele (1999) performed another LES calculation \nfor a compressible round jet.  Yuan et al. (1999) reported a separate series of LES \ncalculations for a round jet issuing normally into a cross flow.  Dianat et al. (2006) \nperformed LES of scalar mixing in a coaxial jet, and Tucker (2008) examined various \nLES submodels for a round jet type configuration with the aim of predicting jet noise.   \n \nA few attempt also been made to perform intermittency modelling of free shear flows \nusing classical Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) techniques. For example, \nByggstoyl and Kollomann (1981) studied the intermittency of a round jet using a \n\uf065\uf02dk  model and Kollmann and Janicka (1982) analysed the intermittency using a \ntransport probability density function (PDF). Cho and Chung (1992) also developed \nmore economical intermittency model by incorporating intermittency transport \nequation to already exist \uf065\uf02dk turbulence model.  \n \nDespite the success of the above noted investigations on free shear flows, further \nstudies for the mixing and its inter related topics such as turbulent intermittency are \nvital. The applicability of large eddy simulation technique for the prediction of \n 5 \nturbulent intermittency is one such issue. The objective of the present work is \ntherefore to study the mixing process and intermittent characteristics of a turbulent \ncoaxial jet in isothermal incompressible conditions using a localised dynamic sub-grid \nmodel version of the large eddy simulation technique. The configuration considered \nhere is a scaled version of a typical RB211 aero engine exhaust using the engine \ncharacteristics provided by Garnier et al. (1997).  We have focused on predicting \nprobability density functions and turbulent intermittency of both velocity and passive \nscalar fields under constant density, non-reacting, incompressible conditions. The \npresent effort can be considered as an essential step in developing understanding for \nthe extension of LES sub-grid scale models to explicitly consider intermittency effects \nin constant density and variable density flow conditions with an ultimate aim of \nimproving simulations for aircraft engine emissions.  \n \nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we discuss the \ngoverning equations and modelling. In section 3, we describe the numerical setup for \nseparate simulations.  Section 4 discuses the results from these simulations and \nanalyses the mixing and intermittency for both velocity and passive scalar fields. Final \nconclusions are presented in section 5.   \n \n2. GOVERNING EQUATIONS \nIn LES the large-scale energy containing scales of motion are resolved numerically \nwhile the small, unresolved scales and their interactions with the large scales are \nmodelled.  The grid-filtering operator, known as a spatial filter, is applied to \ndecompose the resolved and sub-grid scales in the computational domain. Applying \nthe spatial box filter to incompressible governing equations, we obtain the filtered \n 6 \ncontinuity, momentum and passive scalar equations for the large-scale motion as \nfollows: \n0\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\nj\nj\nx\nu\n,  (1) \nj\nij\nj\nij\nij\njii\nxx\nS\nx\nP\nx\nuu\nt\nu\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6 )()2(1)( \uf074\uf06e\n\uf072\n, (2) \njjt\nt\nj\nj\nxx\nc\nx\ncu\nt\nc\n\uf0b6\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6 2\n)(\n)(\n\uf073\n\uf06e\n\uf073\n\uf06e\n,       (3) \nWhere \uf073\uf06e\uf072 ,,,,, cpui and t\uf073 denote the velocity, density, pressure, kinematic \nviscosity, passive scalar concentration, laminar and turbulent Schmidt numbers, and \nthe strain rate tensor, \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf03d\ni\nj\nj\ni\nij\nx\nu\nx\nu\nS\n2\n1\n.

NUMERICAL DETAILS \n3.1 Computational domain, flow conditions and grid resolution \nThe coaxial jet considered has a core jet with diameter 0.878cD m\uf03d , surrounded by an \nannular secondary jet with overall diameter 1.422aD m\uf03d . The centre of the core flow \nis taken as the geometric centre line of the flow where 0\uf03dr and 0\uf03dx . Two \nindependent bulk velocities are used as inlet velocities for the simulations, the bulk \naxial velocity of core jet, 158 \/cU m s\uf03d and the bulk axial velocity of secondary \nannular inlet, 104 \/aU m s\uf03d . The Reynolds number is defined in terms of the primary \n(bulk) axial velocity \uf028 \uf029U , diameter of the core jet annulus )(D  and the kinematic \nviscosity of air \uf06e  such that \uf06eUD\uf03dRe . The computational domain extended for 30 \ncore jet diameters radially and 40 core jet diameters axially, corresponding to \ndimensions of mmm 432626 \uf0b4\uf0b4  in the x,y and z directions respectively. To check grid \nsensitivity, two different grid resolutions have been used and results will be showed \nlater.  The inflow mean axial velocity distribution for the core flow was specified \nusing the power law velocity profile such that \n \n7\/1\n0 1 \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf03e\uf03d\uf03c\nc\nj\nr\nr\nUCU  (6) \n 8 \nwhere jU  is bulk velocity of the core jet, r  is the radial distance from the jet centre \nline, and cr is the radius of the core jet. A value for the constant 28.10 \uf03dC  was \nadopted, which is consistent with a fully developed turbulent pipe flow at outlet.  A \nsimilar equation is used to specify the inlet axial velocity for the annular jet region \nwith the radius of the annular jet replacing that of the core jet such that  \n1\/ 7\n0 1j\na\nr\nU C U\nr\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6\n\uf03c \uf03e\uf03d \uf02d\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0e8 \uf0f8\n     (7) \nwhere jU  is bulk velocity of the annular jet, r  is the radial distance from the jet \ncentre line, and \nar is the radius of the annular jet and similar value is used for \nconstant\n0C . Here we employed an artificial inflow condition to produce instantaneous \nvelocity component \nInU  such that  \n( , ) ( , )In Mean rmsU x t U x t u\uf071 \uf0a2\uf03d \uf02b                         (8) \nwhere \nMeanU is the mean inflow velocity, rmsu\uf0a2 is the root mean square turbulent \nfluctuation and ( , )x t\uf071 is a random number having a Gaussian distribution. This \napproach should be sufficient at low inflow turbulence level and we have used this \nmethod successfully in previous investigations (Ranga Dinesh, 2007). Free slip \nboundary conditions were used for the side walls of the computational domain and \nconvective boundary conditions are used at the outflow.  For the passive scalar, a top \nhat profile was specified at the inlet such that in one case, the passive scalar value was \n1.0 across the core inlet and zero elsewhere, and while for a second case the passive \nscalar value was 1.0 for the annular inlet, and zero elsewhere. For the scalar field a \nzero normal gradient condition was used at the outlet. \n 9 \nThe time averaged mean axial and radial velocities, mean passive scalar components \nand their mean fluctuating values are calculated by time averaging the unsteady \nvariables obtained from LES results, i.e. \n                              2\n1 1\n1 1\n, ( )\nt tN Nn n\nrms\nn nt tN N\n\uf066 \uf066 \uf066 \uf066 \uf066\n\uf03d \uf03d\n\uf03c \uf03e\uf03d \uf03d \uf02d \uf03c \uf03e\uf0e5 \uf0e5   (9) \nWhere  \ntN  represents the number of samples.  \nThe simulations were carried out for 10 flow passes (one flow pass indicates the total \ntime for the inlet flow velocity to reach the outlet boundary) transiently, and then \nstatistics were collected over another 10 flow passes. This allowed the flow field to \nfully develop and any initial transients to exit the computational domain. The samples \nfor the statistical calculations were taken only after the flow field had been established \nto be fully developed.  \n \n3.2 Numerical discretisation \nThe program used to perform simulations is the PUFFIN code developed by \nKirkpatrick et al. (2003a, b, 2005) and later extended by Ranga Dinesh (2007). \nPUFFIN computes the temporal development of large-scale flow structures by solving \nthe transport equations for the spatially filtered continuity, momentum and passive \nscalar. The equations are discretised in space using the finite volume formulation in \nCartesian coordinates on a non-uniform staggered grid. Second order central \ndifferencing (CDS) is used for the spatial discretisation of all terms in both the \nmomentum equation and the pressure correction equation. This minimises the \nprojection error and ensures convergence in conjunction with an iterative solver. The \ndiffusion terms of the passive scalar transport equation are also discretised using the \n 10 \nsecond order CDS. The convection term of the scalar transport equation is discretised \nusing the SHARP scheme (Leonard, 1987).  \nThe time derivative of the mixture fraction is approximated using the Crank-Nicolson \nscheme. The momentum equations are integrated in time using a second order hybrid \nscheme. Advection terms are calculated explicitly using second order Adams-\nBashforth, while diffusion terms are calculated implicitly using second order Adams-\nMoulton to yield an approximate solution for the velocity field. Finally, mass \nconservation is enforced through a pressure correction step. The time step is varied to \nensure that the Courant number iio xtuC \uf044\uf044\uf03d remains approximately constant where \nix\uf044  is the cell width, t\uf044  is the time step and iu  is the velocity component in the ix  \ndirection. The solution is advanced with a time stepping corresponding to a Courant \nnumber in the range of \uf03doC 0.3 to 0.5.  The Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized \n(BiCGStab) method with a Modified Strongly Implicit (MSI) preconditioner is used \nto solve the system of algebraic equations resulting from the discretisation.  \n \n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \nIn this section the results obtained from the LES computations are discussed. First we \ndiscuss the grid sensitivity study, followed by the velocity distributions and passive \nscalar distributions. The radial plots of the mean and rms quantities have been \nnormalised by the diameter of the annular jet )422.1( mDa \uf03d .  \n \n4.1 Grid sensitivity analysis \nWe have initially considered two grid resolutions to investigate the grid sensitivity. \nGrid 1 used 60140140 \uf0b4\uf0b4  grid points along x,y and z directions (approximately 1.2 \n 11 \nmillion cells) and grid 2 used 120140140 \uf0b4\uf0b4 grid points along x,y and z directions \n(approximately 2.4 million cells). Fig. 1 shows the results for mean axial velocity \n(top), rms axial velocity (middle) and mean mixture fraction (bottom) at two different \naxial locations (x\/d=5.0,10.0). Here the dashed line indicates grid 1 (coarse grid) \nresults and solid line indicates grid 2 (fine grid) results. It has been found that the near \nfield comparisons from both grids show similar results whilst some differences are \nfound at downstream axial locations. The peak values of the mean axial velocity and \nmean passive scalar are slightly higher for the coarser grid than finer grid. This shows \nthat the grid resolutions along the axial direction (here z direction) has a direct impact \non mixing of the two jets and in particular that the finer grid is able to capture more \nmixing than the coarser grid due to the higher grid resolution along the axial direction.  \nAll remaining results discuss in this section are thus based on finer grid (2.4 million) \nresolution simulations.  \n \n4.2 Analysis of results for velocity and scalar fields \n4.2.1 Velocity Field: \nFig. 2 presents a contour plot of the mean axial velocity which shows the structure of \nthe coaxial jet where we can see the extent of the potential core of the jet. The \ncentreline mean axial velocity has minimal influence from the annular flow in near \nfield, )0.5\/0( \uf03c\uf03c Dx . As observed by Ko and Kwan (1971) the contour plot reveals \nthe initial merging zone of both inner and outer potential cores, as well as the region \nimmediately downstream (intermediate zone) where the inner and outer mixing \nregions merge. A close up view of the contour plot at near field shows the flow \nseparation between inner and outer potential cores and also the inner and outer mixing \nregions.   \n 12 \nFig. 3 shows the radial plots of the mean axial velocity (left side) and root mean \nsquare (rms) axial velocity (right side) at different axial locations. The mean axial \nprofiles show the expected axi-symmetric behaviour and the mean velocity profile in \nthe core jet is consistent with a fully developed pipe flow profile. As mentioned by \nBuresti et al. (1998), the inlet velocity profile shape can significantly influence the \ncoaxial jet characteristics from near to far field locations. Since we used a power law \nprofile to specify the mean velocity at inlet, the velocity profiles play an important \nrole in producing a weaker shear region in the core side of the inner mixing region. In \naddition, the shear layer regions are also affected by the velocity aspect ratio and \nfurther investigations of different aspect ratios would be beneficial to fully understand \nthe mixing regions and various vortex patterns for coaxial jets in general.  The present \nresults however indicate a self-similar state is established at a closer distance to the jet \nexit plane. This has been also observed by Ribeiro and Whitelaw (1980) in their \ncoaxial jet experiment. Although the core and annular jet have relatively high initial \nbulk velocities, the shape of the axial velocity decay agrees with other findings, e.g. \nSadr and Klewicki (2003). Considering the velocity ratio between the core and \nannular jet regions (\n0\/ 1.48cU U \uf03d ), the length of the potential cores are consistent \nwith previous findings for the velocity ratio \n0\/ 1.24cU U \uf03d  (Sadr and Klewicki) and \nRibeiro and Whitelaw (1980). The existence of higher mean axial velocity in the \ncentral region of the jet is related to higher production associated with the higher \nvelocity ratio of 1.48.  As seen in Fig. 3 the large gradients considered due to the \nvelocity ratio in the mean axial profile lead to increased turbulence intensities as has \nbeen also observed by Champagne and Wygnanski (1971) for their coaxial jet \nexperiment. The centreline rms axial velocity fluctuation has very small values near \nthe centreline and then exhibits a double peak in the region (0.3 \/ 0.5)r D\uf0a3 \uf0a3 . The \n 13 \nhighest peak location occurs in the annular jet as a result of the vortex shedding in the \ninner mixing region between inner potential core and outer potential core. This has \nbeen observed by Sadr and Klewicki (2003). As noted by Champagne and Wygnanski \n(1971) regions with large mean axial velocity gradient contains high turbulence \nintensities and the present simulations confirm this finding. The sudden increase of \nthe velocity fluctuations across the shear layer is an important aspect of the dynamics \nof the coaxial jet at such velocity aspect ratio as discussed in more detail by Dahm et \nal. (1992) who also studied a coaxial jet with\n0\/ 1.48cU U \uf03d . At further downstream \nlocations the centreline rms axial fluctuations increase and follow a similar profile \nshape as the mean axial velocity.    \n \nThe radial plots of the time averaged mean radial velocity (left) and rms radial \nvelocity (right) are shown in Fig. 4. The mean radial velocity is almost zero at near \nfield axial locations (x\/D=0.5, 2.0, 3.0) and gradually increases in the far field outside \nthe centreline. A symmetric behaviour for the mean radial velocity appears at most \naxial locations and its magnitude is mainly determined by turbulent diffusion.  The \nrms radial velocity fluctuation profiles have a small peak value in the region above the \nannular jet at near field positions (x\/D=0.5, 1.0) and the value of this gradually \nincreases at x\/D=2.0, 3.0. The distribution of the rms radial velocity does not show a \nhigh peak at near field axial positions and its magnitude is significantly lower than the \nrms axial velocity. This has also been observed by Ribeiro and Whitelaw (1980). The \ncentreline fluctuations increase in the far field and follow the same distribution shape \nas the rms axial velocity at x\/D=20. The axial and radial fluctuations values are much \ncloser at further downstream axial locations.  \n \n 14 \nFig. 5 shows the shear layer distribution of the coaxial jet. The instantaneous contours \nof the passive scalar field show both the inner shear layer, situated between inner core \nand outer core, and the outer shear layer. As seen in both rms axial and radial \nfluctuations, the peak fluctuation values observed in the inner shear layer are \nassociated with rapid mixing inside the inner mixing region. Fig. 5 reveals that the \ninitial shear layer instabilities are relatively smooth in the near field, but then start to \nroll-up to form vortices in the intermediate and far field regions.  The roll-up of the \nvortices begins at the tip of the inner potential core and expands rapidly out into axial \nand radial directions.  The captured shear layer and the vortex patters are consistent \nwith the observation of Dahm et al. (1992) for the same velocity aspect ratio \n(\n0\/ 1.48cU U \uf03d ). However, Dahm et al. (1992) found various alternative vortex \npatterns with different dynamic structures over a wide range of inlet velocity aspect \nratios.   \n \n4.2.2 Scalar Field: \nThe present work has considered separating initial conditions for the passive scalar \nmixing. The first case (case 1) simulated the scalar mixing by setting the value to 1 \nonly across the core inlet to the domain, while the second case (case 2) simulated the \nscalar field development with the initial value set to 1 only across the annular inlet. \nBoth simulations have been run independently and separate statistics were collected \nfor time averaged calculations.  \n \nFigs. 6 and 7 show sections through the filtered passive scalar and corresponding \npassive scalar isosurfaces respectively for case 1. Fig. 6 shows the near field passive \nscalar exhibits little mixing and slow development due to the high core jet velocity \n 15 \nand thus exists less vortex structures in the near field. Fig. 6 and 7 further reveal that \nthe passive scalar mixing gradually increases in the intermediate region and different \nvortex patterns form that spread radially at downstream axial locations. The \nsubsequent development of the shear layers in the intermediate region appear to be \ndominated by the vortical eddy structures which form and influence the passive scalar \ndistribution in the intermediate region. The roll up of the passive scalar vortices and \nthe passive scalar distribution remain axi-symmetric. The equivalent sectional filtered \npassive scalar and isosurface plots for case 2 are shown in Figs. 8 and 9.   \n \nFig. 10 shows the time averaged mean passive scalar at different axial locations. The \nsolid line indicates the radial plots of the mean passive scalar for case 1 and the \ndashed line indicates the same variable for case 2.  The mean passive scalar exhibits \nthe expected Gaussian shape. The radial profile development for case 1 shows less \nmixing at upstream positions (x\/D=0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0). The radial spread of the \npassive scalar then starts to increase towards the far field, developing smoothly at \ndownstream positions. The radial scalar profiles in case 2 also shows a graduall \nincrease in the mixing rate towards the far field. However the mixing for the two \ncases shows same differences at far field axial locations. For example, the case 1 peak \nvalue is much higher than case 2 at intermediate regions such as x\/D=5.0, 10.0, but \ncase 2 profiles have higher values than case 1 further downstream, x\/D=20.0, 30.0. \nMuch of the mixing for both cases takes place in the developing region including the \npotential cores as has been observed by Champagne and Wygnanski (1971) in their \nsimilar coaxial jet experiment. One can assume that significant intermittency in both \nvelocity and passive scalar fields should occur in these regions and the investigation \nof probability density distributions and intermittency profiles for both velocity and \n 16 \npassive scalar would thus provide useful further details of the mixing processes. \nTherefore the next section discusses the intermittency of both the velocity and scalar \nfields using the numerical data extracted from the simulated turbulent coaxial jet. \n \n4.3 Analysis of results for intermittency fields \nTurbulent shear flows with free boundaries displays an intermittent character \nespecially closer to the outer edge of the flow where the flow alternate between \nrotational and irrotational states. The study of turbulent intermittency is important for \nmany applications such as boundary layer transition in modern turbines and aerofoils, \nignition of combustion devices and environmental emissions. The majority of existing \nturbulence models were originally derived for fully developed flows and thus exhibit \nsome deficiencies in the inhomogeneous intermittent regions near the outer edge of \nsuch flows which contaminated with irrotational flow. Therefore detailed \nunderstanding of the applicability of existing turbulence models in large eddy \nsimulation for turbulent intermittency is essential and timely. Here we study the \ncalculated probability density functions and radial intermittency plots for the velocity \nand passive scalar fields using the dynamic sub-grid LES model.   \n \nThe mathematical derivation for intermittency can be expressed using an indicator \nfunction with the value of one in turbulent regions and zero in non-turbulent (laminar) \nregions. It represents the fraction of time interval during which a point is inside the \nturbulent fluid. Andreotti (1999) experimentally tested and demonstrated a technique \ncalled the normalised histogram method for determine the associated probability \ndensity function (PDF). From this, the intermittency value can be calculated using a \nsummation of probability values for a given threshold value. To calculate the \n 17 \nintermittency from PDF\u2019s here we used the method proposed by Schefer and Dibble \n(2001) in which it is assumed that the PDF is smooth at the scale of one histogram \nbin. Here 8000 measurements at each spatial location with 50 bins over 3 \uf073\uf02d  limits \nof data are considered. Therefore the normalised PDF\u2019s can be written as  \n         \uf028 \uf029\n1\n0\n1P f df \uf03d\uf0f2                                                                               (8) \nThe intermittency value \uf067  (Gamma) can be calculated from the probability values \nrespect to considered threshold value such that  \n           ( )thP f f\uf067 \uf03d \uf03e        (9) \n \n4.3.1 Velocity Field Intermittency: \nHere we discuss the probability density function (PDF) and radial intermittency \nprofiles for the velocity at different downstream axial locations. Fig. 11 shows the \nprobability density distributions of instantaneous axial velocity at x\/D=20 (a-c) and \nx\/D=30 (d-f).  The pdf of axial velocity follows Gaussian shape on the centreline and \nclose to the centreline, but changes from a Gaussian distribution to delta function at \nfar radial locations. The intermediate region from Gaussian to delta shape can be \nidentified as a highly intermittent region where frequent switches from rotational to \nirrotational behaviour happen. As the present discussion is focused on a coaxial jet, \nthe variation of pdfs from Gaussian to delta starting from the centreline to far radial \nlocations at given axial distance can change with velocity aspect ratio 0\/cU U . Fig.11 \n(d)-(f) show the pdfs of velocity at x\/D=30 and a similar observation can be made for \nthe pdf shapes with respect to radial distance. Again the pdf shapes change from \nGaussian to delta with increased radial distance, but discrepancies are apparent for pdf \nshapes between the two axial locations, x\/D=20 and x\/D=30. For example, Fig 11. (b) \n 18 \nand (e) show the pdfs of axial velocity at the same radial location for x\/D=20 and 30. \nThe pdf shape of Fig. 11 (b) exhibit a less Gaussian shape, but not a delta function \nshape and thus define a region indicates of more intermittent behaviour. By \ncomparison the pdf shape of Fig. 11 (e) is already closer to delta shape and thus \nindicates less intermittent behaviour compare with Fig. 11 (b).  To analyse this \nparticular finding we have also considered radial intermittency profiles.  In this case \nthe velocity intermittency is calculated from the probability density distribution of the \ninstantaneous velocity.  For velocity intermittency calculation, we used a threshold \nvalue of 13.1 m\/s which is equal ( ) \/10c aU U\uf02b .   \n \nThe radial variation of the velocity intermittency at x\/D=10, 20 and 30 is shown in \nFig.12. The intermittency value is unity close to centreline at all three locations and \nthen starts to reduce with increased radial distance. At x\/D=10 (Fig 12. a) the \nintermittency shows a sudden drop and thus as can expect a smaller change between \nrotational and irrotational vortices. The intermittency gradually increases towards the \nfar field x\/D=20, 30 close to the outer edge of the flow where the viscous super layer \nplays a dominant role and thus produces more intermediate values of intermittency \nbetween 0 and 1. Finally, the velocity field converts to laminar with respect to \nthreshold value (13.1 m\/s) at far radial locations and thus intermittency values fall to \nzero here.  \n \n4.3.2 Scalar Field Intermittency: \nIn this section we discuss the pdfs and intermittency of the passive scalar field for two \nconsidered cases, identified as case 1 and case 2 in the scalar mixing section. Fig.13 \n(a)-(c) show the passive scalar pdfs at x\/D=20 and Fig. 13 (d)-(f) show the pdf values \n 19 \nx\/D=30. Similar pdf variation can be seen at both x\/D=20 and 30 axial locations. The \npdfs of the passive scalar shows more mixing near the centreline region and then \nfollows the delta function with increased radial distance.  \n \n The corresponding pdfs of the passive scalar for case 2 are shown in Fig. 14. In this \ncase, the pdf variation shows some differences for the axial locations x\/D=20 (Fig. 14 \na-c) and x\/D=30 (d-f). The centreline pdf values at x\/D=20 follow a Gaussian type \ndistribution, while pdfs at x\/D=30 take an intermediate shape between Gaussian and \ndelta forms. Similar behaviour can be seen in Fig. 14 (b) and (e). However the pdfs \nfollow delta function distribution at the far radial locations for both x\/D=20 and 30. \nFig.15 shows the radial variation of the passive scalar intermittency at x\/D=10, 20 and \n30 for case 1 and case 2. Here intermittency is defined as the fraction of time that \npassive scalar is greater than a surrounding medium threshold. In this work, we used a \npassive scalar threshold value 0.015 as proposed by Schefer and Dibble (2001) for \ntheir intermittent propane jet.  \n \nComparison between case 1 (circles) and case 2 (gradients) shows these similar at \nx\/D=10 and then differences widen at x\/D=20 and 30. The region near the centreline \nshows a unit value for the intermittency and thus suggests turbulent mixing is not \nenough to transport unmixed air into the core region of such a coaxial jet. The \nintermittency profiles shape is similar for both cases at x\/D=20, but slight deviation \noccurs for the intermittency values. Again, similar variation occurs at x\/D=30. It can \nalso be seen from Fig.12 and 15 that the radial intermittency of passive scalar profiles \nare consistent with corresponding velocity profiles at their axial locations.   \n \n 20 \n5. CONCLUSION  \nSimulations for a turbulent coaxial jet with high core and annular jet velocities (with \naspect ratio of\n0\/ 1.48cU U \uf03d ) have been conducted using LES. The simulations \nstudied both velocity and passive scalar fields, and the investigation considered both \ninstantaneous and time averaged quantities to describe the flow and mixing fields. The \nradial plots of mean and rms of velocity field have been discussed and the passive \nscalar distributions have been separated into two parts in studying the mixing from \ncorresponding simulations with passive scalar introduced initially from the core and \nannular inlet jets. The mean flow field captured the potential cores and initial self-\nsimilar states. The high velocity fluctuations occurring inside the inner mixing regions \ndue to the vortex shedding have also been captured by the present simulation. The \ntime averaged mean scalar distributions exhibited similarities in the near field and \ndifferences in the far fields for the two cases.  The calculated velocity fluctuations \nresulted in intermittent behaviour near the jet boundaries for both velocity and passive \nscalar fields. The probability density functions and radial intermittency plots obtained \ndescribe the balance between the rotational irrotational states for a given threshold \nvalue and thus shows a significance of intermittency close to outer edge of the flow.   \n \nAcknowledgment  \nThis work was supported by the EPSRC funding under grant EP\/E036945\/1 on the \nModelling and Simulation of Intermittent Flows.
