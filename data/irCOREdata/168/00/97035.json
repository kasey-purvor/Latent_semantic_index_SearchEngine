INTRODUCTION\nThe vast majority of studies of reaction diffusion systems\nhave been directed at analysis of their steady states. How-\never, if these systems are to provide an explanation of bio-\nlogical patterning, they must also be able to produce patterns\non a biologically realistic time scale. It is therefore important\nto consider the speed of formation of pattern \u00031\u0004.\nA major limitation on the speed of the patterning process\narises from the fact that most potential morphogens diffuse\nslowly in the embryo. Crick \u00032\u0004 addressed this issue in his\nclassic 1970 paper, and showed that simple and facilitated\ndiffusion of small molecules within and between cells are\nsufficient to account for the formation of stable concentration\ngradients around a localized source. Crick considered the\ntime taken for a gradient in the concentration of a chemical\nspecies to be established through simple diffusion in a one-\ndimensional domain with a source at one end and a sink at\nthe other. Arguing from basic biophysical principles, Crick\ndeduced that in a time of about three hours a gradient can be\nestablished over a distance of a millimeter or less, but not\nover a distance of a centimeter. More recently, Lander et al.\n\u00033\u0004 have obtained comparable results for the case of growth\nfactors diffusing in the extracellular environment, but it re-\nmains unclear whether these results hold in a general reac-\ntion diffusion scenario. In a reaction diffusion system, every\npoint in the spatial domain is a potential source of the chemi-\ncal species concerned and so pattern formation does not de-\npend directly on the movement of morphogen away from a\nlocalized source.\nIn many biological patterning scenarios, gradient estab-\nlishment by simple diffusion is likely to be too slow \u0001espe-\ncially since many candidate morphogens are proteins such as\ngrowth factors that have relatively low diffusibility due to\nstrong interactions with the extracellular matrix\u0002. As shown\nby Crick, the time taken to establish a steady state gradient\non a spatial domain of length L is proportional to L2, and this\nimposes an upper bound on the size of domain over which\npattern can be established by simple diffusion. Systems in\nwhich each point of the domain can potentially act as a\nsource of morphogen can generate spatial gradients more\nquickly, since diffusion across the entire domain is not nec-\nessary. For example, such systems can generate traveling\nwaves that propagate across the domain in a time propor-\ntional to L. While these traveling waves typically result in\nspatially uniform steady states, they can still generate stable\ngradients of cellular response if individual cells \u201cintegrate\u201d\nthe morphogen signal over time \u00034\u0004. Such signal integration\nhas recently been described in the graded response of cells to\nthe growth factor Activin in Xenopus embryos \u00035\u0004.\nIn this paper we investigate the speed of pattern formation\nin two-component reaction diffusion systems, with the aim\nof exploring whether such mechanisms can generate stable\npatterns on time scales that are appropriate for embryonic\ndevelopment. In particular, we focus attention on the specific\ncase of the initiation of the primitive streak in chick embryos\n\u00036\u0004. We first use standard linear analysis to determine the\nspeed of patterning, and then investigate the validity of the\nlinear analysis estimates of the time scales and explore non-\nlinear pattern selection and growth. We establish a correla-\ntion between the wavelength of the pattern and the time\ntaken for it to form, and deduce that it is not possible to form\na long wavelength pattern in a short time. Finally, we look at\na specific modification of the standard reaction diffusion\nmodel which can reduce the time taken to form a pattern of a\ngiven number of peaks.\n*Email address: kpage@math.ucl.ac.uk FAX: \u000144 20 7387 1397.\n\u2020Email address: n.monk@sheffield.ac.uk\n\u2021Email address: maini@maths.ox.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 011902 \u00012007\u0002\n1539-3755\/2007\/76\u00011\u0002\/011902\u000115\u0002 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society011902-1\nII. LINEAR ANALYSIS AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION\nOF TWO-COMPONENT REACTION DIFFUSION\nSYSTEMS\nIn this section we present results relating to the growth\nrates of pattern modes from perturbations around a homoge-\nneous steady state. Using linear analysis, we show that the\nspeed of pattern formation depends on the wave number of\nthe pattern and on the spatial discretization. We focus our\nattention on a two-component reaction diffusion system in\none spatial dimension with zero flux boundary conditions.\nFollowing nondimensionalization of the system in space,\nsuch that the spatial domain becomes \u00030,1\u0004, the general\nsystem is represented by the following equations:\nut = f\u0001u,v\u0002 + Duuxx,\nvt = g\u0001u,v\u0002 + Dvvxx,\nux = vx = 0 at x = 0,1, \u00011\u0002\nwhere u and v are the concentrations of the two morphogens,\nDu and Dv are the corresponding diffusion coefficients, and\nf\u0001u ,v\u0002 and g\u0001u ,v\u0002 encode the reaction kinetics between u\nand v.\nWe study three different kinetic schemes. Our primary\nexample, which we study throughout the paper, uses Gierer-\nMeinhardt \u0001GM\u0002 kinetics. \u00037\u0004 The GM model has pure\nactivator-inhibitor kinetics \u0001that is, the activator upregulates\nboth the activator and inhibitor, while the inhibitor down-\nregulates both\u0002. We also study two example models with\ncross kinetics \u0001where the activator upregulates itself, but\ndownregulates the inhibitor and the inhibitor likewise up-\nregulates the activator and downregulates itself\u0002. These are\nthe Schnakenberg or depletion \u00038,7\u0004 and glycolysis \u00039\u0004 mod-\nels. Following nondimensionalization \u0001see Appendix A for\ndetails\u0002 the forms of f and g for these models are as follows:\n\u0001i\u0002 Gierer-Meinhardt,\nf\u0001u,v\u0002 = r\u0005u2\nv\n+ 1\u0006 \u2212 \u0002u, g\u0001u,v\u0002 = ru2 \u2212 \u0003v; \u00012\u0002\n\u0001ii\u0002 Schnakenberg or delpletion,\nf\u0001u,v\u0002 = r\u0001u2v + 1\u0002 \u2212 \u0002u, g\u0001u,v\u0002 = \u0004 \u2212 ru2v; \u00013\u0002\n\u0001iii\u0002 glycolysis,\nf\u0001u,v\u0002 = ru2v + \u0003v \u2212 \u0002u, g\u0001u,v\u0002 = r\u00011 \u2212 u2v\u0002 \u2212 \u0003v . \u00014\u0002\nIn each case, the parameters r, \u0002, \u0003, and \u0004 are positive.\nWhen performing numerical simulations of these equa-\ntions, we used the numerical algorithms group \u0001NAG\u0002 library\nroutine D03PCF. This routine uses finite differences for spa-\ntial discretization and employs the method of lines to reduce\nthe system of PDEs to a system of ODEs. The ODE system\nis solved using a backward differentiation formula method.\nAn error tolerance of 10\u22127 was specified and the accuracy of\nthe numerics was verified by performing each simulation\nwith an error tolerance of 10\u22129 instead.\nA. Spatially homogeneous steady states and Jacobian matrices\nIn order to calculate linear growth rates of periodic pat-\nterns in these systems, we first find the spatially homoge-\nneous steady states and Jacobian matrices \u000310\u0004.

Bounds on pattern growth\nIn this section, we present bounds on the linear growth\nrate of spatially periodic patterns \u0001modes\u0002 about the homo-\ngeneous steady state. We first find bounds on the linear\ngrowth rate of all modes, both in general and for each spe-\ncific model described in the previous section. We then con-\nsider the effects on pattern growth of the initial perturbations\n\u0001noise\u0002 about the homogeneous steady state and of the spatial\ndiscretization used in simulations of the models. Details of\nthe analysis are given in Appendix B.\n1. Linear growth rate of any mode\nThe linear growth rate of any growing mode in a two-\ncomponent reaction diffusion system is bounded above by\nthe rate of growth in the corresponding system in the limit as\nactivator diffusion tends to zero. This limiting growth rate is\ngiven by the first \u0001J11\u0002 entry in the Jacobian matrix of the\nPAGE, MONK, AND MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 011902 \u00012007\u0002\n011902-2\nlinearized system. The maximum growth rate \u0005max \u0001over all\nmodes, without considering the restrictions placed by the\nboundary conditions\u0002 is given by\n\u0005max = fu +\nDu\u0001fu \u2212 gv\u0002 \u2212 2\t\u2212 fvguDuDv\nDv \u2212 Du\n\u0006 fu. \u000111\u0002\nThe inequality must hold in order for the parameters to be in\nthe Turing space. For all three of the example models de-\nscribed in the previous section this implies that \u0005max\u0006\u0002.\nThis bound is on the growth rate of the fastest growing\nmode. However, this mode has wave number k* where\nk*\n2\n=\ngv \u2212 fu + \u0001Dv + Du\u0002\t\u2212 fvgu\/DuDv\nDv \u2212 Du\n\n\t\u2212 fvgu\nDv\n1\n\tDu\nas Du \u2192 0. \u000112\u0002\nIt therefore leads to a many-peaked pattern as Du gets small\n\u0001i.e., as we get near to attaining the limiting growth rate\u0002.\nIn Fig. 5, we give examples of k* \/\u0007, the linear analysis\nestimate of the number of half peaks, and \u0005max, the estimated\nlinear growth rate of the pattern, and compare these estimates\nto the results of numerical simulations.\nIn many important biological scenarios \u0001for example,\nprimitive streak initiation in the chick \u00036\u0004\u0002 the system must\ninitiate a pattern that comprises either a single peak or a\nsmall number of peaks. To account for such patterning, we\nrequire a system that can generate a pattern of only a few\npeaks in a biologically realistic time. Making the assumption\nthat the growth of a pattern of given period will be limited by\nthe growth rate of the linear mode of the same period \u0001we\nevaluate the validity of this assumption later\u0002, we consider\nbounds on the linear growth rates of given modes. In this\ncase, we can derive bounds depending crucially on the dif-\nfusion coefficients. This is important since those chemical\nspecies which are considered candidate morphogens in the\nearly embryo are expected to have small diffusion coeffi-\ncients, whereas little is known about the sizes of the kinetic\nparameters.\n2. Mode-specific linear growth rates\nFor the Gierer-Meinhardt model \u00037\u0004, the linear growth rate\nof the mode with wave number k is restricted \u0001see Appendix\nB\u0002 by\n\u0005\u0001k\u0002\u0006\nDv\u0001\t2 \u2212 1\u0002k2\n2\n. \u000113\u0002\nOn a domain of length L with zero flux boundary conditions,\nk will take values n\u0007 \/L, n=1,2. . .. On a periodic domain of\nlength L it will take only values which are multiples of\n2\u0007 \/L. Equation \u000113\u0002 clearly places a much more stringent\nbound on the growth of few-peaked modes than the general\nbound of Eq. \u000111\u0002.\nIf we look, for instance, at the rate of establishment of a\ngradient pattern \u0001i.e., a single-peaked pattern\u0002 on an effec-\ntively one-dimensional domain of length L with zero flux\nboundary conditions, we find, substituting k=\u0007 \/L into Eq.\n\u000113\u0002, that \u0005\u00062Dv \/L2. Standard linear analysis tells us that\nthe initial growth of the n\u0007 mode about the uniform steady\nstate is described by An\u0001t\u0002=An\u00010\u0002e\u0005\u0001n\u0007\u0002t, where An\u0001t\u0002 is the\namplitude of the n\u0007 mode at time t. Thus the time taken for\nthe n\u0007 mode to reach y% of the uniform steady state value is\ngiven by 1\u0005 ln\u0003\nu0y\n100An\n\u0004. The time taken for a gradient to be\nestablished clearly depends on the initial amplitude of the\ngradient mode, although 1\/\u0005 gives an indication of the time\nscale of establishment.\n3. Dependence of linear growth rates on initial conditions\nIn de novo patterning, the gradient mode is present in the\ninitial conditions due to noise in the system. The initial am-\nplitude of each mode depends on the nature of the initial\nperturbations to the homogeneous steady state, and it is dif-\nficult to assess the exact nature of this noise experimentally.\nTherefore unless the statistics of the Fourier components of\nthe initial conditions are insensitive to the type of noise, it\nwill be difficult to assess the initial Fourier components and\nhence the time taken for a pattern to form. If the noise is\nrandomly distributed at each cell \u0001discretization point or set\nof such points\u0002 in the domain and is white with mean 0 and\nexpected magnitude z% of the uniform steady state value,\nthen we find that the gradient mode initially has an amplitude\nof approximately z\t2\/m% of the uniform steady state value,\nwhere m is the number of cells in the domain \u0001see Appendix\nC\u0002.\nThis result demonstrates that for noisy initial conditions\nof this type, the initial Fourier components and the time\ntaken to form a pattern are sensitive to the number of cells in\nthe domain. If we consider the cellular and stochastic nature\nof the system to be important, then it is also important to\nconsider the effects that these features have on the equations\nas well as on the initial conditions. Turing showed that for a\nreaction diffusion system, the contribution of an additive\nnoise term in the Fourier components was significant only in\na small initial time window \u000311\u0004. Thereafter, the growing\nmodes to which the noise contributes initially become suffi-\nciently large that any newly added noise component is insig-\nnificant. Thus we hypothesize that partial differential equa-\ntion \u0001PDE\u0002 models may provide a fairly accurate description\nof noise-driven de novo patterning only after an initial \u201cwait-\ning time,\u201d during which the system should be studied using\nstochastic methods. In general, the final \u0001steady state\u0002 pat-\nterns formed by reaction diffusion systems are insensitive to\nthe details of noise present in the system \u0001at least for low\nwave-number patterns and reasonably white noise\u0002 and so it\nis typically assumed that it is possible to ignore the initial\nstochastic phase in analyzing those patterns. However, in or-\nder to calculate the time taken for patterns to form, we re-\nquire a waiting time and PDE initial conditions to be calcu-\nlated using stochastic analysis.\nIn the following, we shall assume that the main effect of\nthe stochasticity is to give rise to small amplitude Fourier\ncomponents in the initial conditions. Furthermore, we shall\nassume that the cellular nature of the system has little effect\non the time taken for a pattern to be produced, except\nthrough its effect on the spatial scale of fluctuations in the\ninitial conditions. Thus we will suppose that the initial am-\nSPEED OF REACTION DIFFUSION IN EMBRYOGENESIS PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 011902 \u00012007\u0002\n011902-3\nplitude of a Fourier component is approximately z\t2\/m%, as\nsuggested by the analysis in Appendix C.\nWe assume that cells can interpret a gradient when it has\namplitude y% of the uniform steady state value. The ampli-\ntude of the gradient mode will thus have to increase about\n\tm\n2\ny\nz -fold in order for an interpretable gradient to appear.\nThis means that \u0005t \u0001where t is the time\u0002 must reach a value of\nln\u0001\tm2 yz \u0002=ln\u0001 yz \u0002+ 12 ln\u0001m2 \u0002, assuming linear growth.\nThis dependence on the number of cells in the domain\nmeans that care must be taken not only in modeling biologi-\ncal cellular systems using continuum equations, but also in\nthe numerical solution of continuum equations using discreti-\nzation. It is common practice to generate noise in the initial\nconditions by introducing a random variable at each spatial\ndiscretization point. It should be noted that this will lead to\ndifferent times taken for pattern formation as the number of\ndiscretization points is varied and is different from generat-\ning random fluctuations in the magnitude of the Fourier\ncomponents.\nSince we only have a logarithmic dependence on m in the\ntime taken for a pattern to form, we only need to know its\nsize to an order of magnitude. We will fix m in the following\nanalysis at 100, corresponding to a domain length of ap-\nproximately 3 mm \u0001assuming a cell diameter of 30 \u0002m\u0002 and\nassume that this will give a reasonable approximation for\ndomains in the range of 1 mm to 1 cm. Thus \u0005t must reach a\nvalue of ln\u0001y \/z\u0002+ln\u000150\u0002 \/2. From our previous bound on \u0005\nwe deduce that t\bAL2 \/Dv, where A is a dimensionless con-\nstant whose value is about 0.5\u0003ln\u0001y \/z\u0002+ln\u000150\u0002 \/2\u0004. If we as-\nsume that y is likely to be larger than z, we see that A\n\t0.97. For simple diffusion on a one-dimensional domain\nwith a source at one end and a sink at the other, Crick ob-\ntained patterning times of the same form, with values of A in\nthe range of approximately 0.1\u20130.5 \u00033\u0004. Our analysis shows\nthat the Gierer-Meinhardt model generates a gradient on an\neven slower time scale, although it does so de novo, being\ntriggered simply by noise, rather than an initial polarity of\nthe system.\n4. Mode-specific linear growth rates for general models\nThe bound given in inequality \u000113\u0002 applies only for the\nGierer-Meinhardt model. We can obtain a \u0001albeit weaker\u0002\nbound for general reaction diffusion models:\n\u0005\u0001k\u0002\n\nDvk2\n\u000b \u2212 1\n, \u000114\u0002\nwhere \u000b= \u000bgufv\u000bfu2 For the three example models\n\u0001Gierer-Meinhardt, Schnakenberg or depletion, and\nglycolysis\u0002, the conditions for diffusion-driven instability\nimply that \u000b\t2 and hence from Eq. \u000114\u0002 we obtain\n\u0005\u0001k\u0002\n Dvk2. \u000115\u0002\nFigure 1 shows an example plot of the dispersion relation\n\u0001\u0005 vs k\u0002 for the Gierer-Meinhardt model, along with the\nbounds given in Eqs. \u000111\u0002, \u000113\u0002, and \u000115\u0002. In the context of\nembryonic patterning, the latter two bounds are of greater\ninterest, since the growth rates are restricted by the inhibitor\ndiffusion rate. It is likely that the diffusion rates are restricted\nto be less than 10\u22126 cm2\/s, whereas we have little idea of the\nsize of the kinetic parameters. We see from the figure that all\nof the bounds are quite weak, but that Eq. \u000113\u0002 gives the best\nbound on the growth rates of the lower modes.\nInequality \u000115\u0002 means that the establishment of a gradient\non a domain of length L with zero flux boundary conditions\nwill take a time t\tAL2 \/Dv where A is approximately\n\u0003ln\u0001y \/z\u0002+ln\u000150\u0002 \/2\u0004 \/\u00072, which for y\tz is at least 0.2. How-\never, this general bound is not very stringent. The inequality\n\u000114\u0002 gives the same value A\t0.2 for the Gierer-Meinhardt\nmodel. This is clearly much less stringent than the heuristic\nbound obtained in the previous section. We show in Fig. 2 an\nexample of how the bounds compare to the actual times\ntaken for the gradient to reach 10% amplitude in simulations\nof the Gierer-Meinhardt model system. In the simulations,\nwe used initial conditions with random fluctuation of \u00b110%\namplitude around the homogeneous steady state value at\neach discretization point. Five simulations with each of m\n=31, 101, and 1001 discretization points were performed.\nThese results show that for the parameter set used, the actual\ntimes taken for the pattern to reach 10% amplitude are much\ngreater than the bounds that we have obtained.\nEven though the general bound is not stringent, if we take\na generous upper bound on the inhibitor diffusion coefficient\nof 10\u22126 cm2\/s, then, on a domain of length 3 mm, we get t\n\t1.8\f104 s, which is about five hours. However, the\nbounds are weak and unlikely to be attainable. Certainly, the\nreaction diffusion systems that we have studied appear to\npattern on a significantly longer time scale than this. How-\never, our bounds suggest that reaction diffusion could be a\nplausible mechanism for patterning on smaller length scales.\nFor inhibitor diffusion coefficients of the order of 10\u22128 cm2\/s\nor higher, patterning could be attained in a plausible time on\ndomains of about 100 \u0002m \u0001for a potential example, see \u000312\u0004\u0002.\n0 10 20 30 40\n\u22121\n\u22120.8\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\ndispersion relation\nbound (11)\nbound (13)\nbound (15)\n\u03bb\nk\nFIG. 1.

Influence of initial conditions and noise in the system\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the initial condi-\ntions influence the time taken for pattern to develop. Specifi-\ncally, it is often the case that the growing pattern is domi-\nnated by the fastest \u0001exponentially\u0002 growing mode \u0001see\nbelow\u0002. In this case, the time taken for the pattern to reach a\ncertain threshold amplitude \u0001capable of interpretation by the\ncells\u0002 depends crucially on the initial amplitude of that mode.\nIn order to calculate the patterning times then, we need to be\nable to calculate the size of the Fourier components of the\ninitial data.\nSo far, we have assumed that the initial conditions involve\nrandom perturbations about the uniform steady state. In our\nnumerical simulations, we implement this by considering the\nnoise in each variable to be an independent random variable\nuniformly distributed between \u00b1z% of its uniform steady\nstate value at each point in our discretization. In the follow-\ning analysis, we consider noise which is added pointwise at\neach cell or discretization point of the system at a level pro-\nportional to the uniform steady state value. For each species,\nwe have\nu\u0001r\u0002 = \u00031 + \r\u0001r\u0002\u0004u0, r = 1, . . . ,p , \u000116\u0002\nwhere u is the concentration of the species, now considered\nas a function of the cell or discretization node number r, u0 is\nthe uniform steady state value, p is the number of cells or\nnodes, and \r is a random variable such that the \r\u0001r\u0002 are\nindependent with zero mean.\nClearly, each time we run our simulation \u0001or look at a\ndifferent individual biological system\u0002, the initial data will be\ndifferent. We cannot therefore exactly determine a priori the\nmagnitude of a given Fourier mode in a specific set of initial\ndata, but instead we attempt to determine the statistics of the\nmode amplitude. The details of this analysis are presented in\nAppendix C.\nWe find that as we increase the number of cells in our\nsystem or spatial points in our discretization, the Fourier\ncomponents become vanishingly small with probability 1.\nThis means that the time taken to form a pattern will increase\nunboundedly with p. While real biological systems have only\na finite number of cells and hence patterning will occur in\nfinite time, it is nonetheless clear that this time will depend\non the details of the noise present in the system.\nWe note that if the noise at each cell of the system is\nGaussian white noise \u0001i.e., it is normally distributed\u0002, then,\nsince the sum of independent normal random variables is a\nnormal random variable, the Fourier components will also\nhave Gaussian distributions. Since we know the mean and\nvariance of the Fourier components \u0003to O\u00011\/ p\u0002\u0004, we know\ncompletely their distributions. We can, for example, work out\nthe expected magnitude of a Fourier component:\nE\u0001\u000bAn\u000b\u0002 =\n1\n\u000e\u0001An\u0002\t2\u0007\n\f\n\u2212\u000f\n\u000f\n\u000bx\u000be\u2212x\n2\/2\u000e2\u0001An\u0002dx + O\u00051p\u0006\n=\t 2\n\u0007\n\u000e\u0001An\u0002 + O\u00051p\u0006 = 2u0\u000e\u0001\r\u0002\tp\u0007 + O\u00051p\u0006 .\nFigure 3 shows a sample set of the Fourier components\nA1\u2013A5, obtained from numerically generated initial data with\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n0\n400\n800\n1200\n1600\nt\nm\nFIG. 2.

HOW WELL DOES LINEAR ANALYSIS PREDICT THE\nGROWTH RATE OF PATTERNS?\nIn this section we simulate the model equations numeri-\ncally to see whether the patterns formed correspond to those\npredicted by linear analysis and we calculate the rates of\ngrowth of the patterns and compare them with the predic-\ntions from linear analysis. We use a discretization of 1001\npoints and the initial conditions are given by random pertur-\nbations about the uniform steady state values of both activa-\ntor and inhibitor. The random perturbations are independent\nat each point of the discretization and are uniformly distrib-\nuted between \u00b15% of the uniform steady state values. We did\nnot vary the number of spatial points, since this would alter\nthe initial conditions and give rise to slightly different pattern\namplitude profiles.\nWe consider the Gierer-Meinhardt model equations \u00011\u0002\nand \u00012\u0002 on a one-dimensional spatial domain with zero flux\nboundary conditions and we nondimensionalize in space,\nsuch that the domain becomes \u00030, 1\u0004, and in time with a fixed\ntime scale of 104 s \u0001just under three hours\u0002. This time scale is\narbitrary, but is chosen to match the typical time scale of\npatterning in many embryonic patterning processes. We have\nchosen a \u0001nondimensional\u0002 value of 0.027 for Du, since this\ncorresponds to an inhibitor diffusion coefficient of\n10\u22126 cm2\/s on a domain of length 6 mm \u0001the approximate\ncircumference of the marginal zone of the chick blastodisc\nbefore primitive streak initiation \u00036\u0004\u0002. We fix the ratio of\ndiffusion coefficients d\rDu \/Dv=0.01 and the nonlinear ac-\ntivator and inhibitor production parameter r=0.001. We vary\nthe decay rates \u0002 and \u0003, so that linear analysis predicts se-\nlection of modes 1 to 6.\nFigure 5 displays the results of two example simulations\n\u0001further simulations can be found in \u000313\u0004\u0002, showing the\nsteady state activator profile \u0003Figs. 5\u0001a\u0002 and 5\u0001c\u0002\u0004 and a plot\nof ln\u0001umax\u2212umin\u0002 against time \u0003Figs. 5\u0001b\u0002 and 5\u0001d\u0002\u0004, where\numax and umin are the maximal and minimal values of the\nactivator, respectively. The gradient gives a measure of the\nrate of growth: in a linear system, the growth would be ex-\nponential and our logarithm plot would hence be a straight\nline with gradient equal to the growth rate. According to the\nlinear theory,\nu\u0001x,t\u0002 = \u000e\nn\nAne\u0005nt cos\u0001n\u0007x\u0002 \u000f An\n*\ne\u0005max t cos\u0001n*\u0007x\u0002 ,\n\u000117\u0002\nwhere An is the initial amplitude of the nth Fourier mode, \u0005n\nis its growth rate, and n* corresponds to the mode with maxi-\nmal growth rate \u0005max. Thus\numax \u2212 umin \u000f 2An\n*\ne\u0005max t \u000118\u0002\nand\nln\u0001umax \u2212 umin\u0002 = ln\u00012An\n*\n\u0002 + \u0005max t . \u000119\u0002\nIn each simulation, the activator undergoes a period of\nexponential growth. The growth rates during this phase, cal-\nculated from the numerical data, are given in the caption of\nFig. 5. Figures 5\u0001e\u0002 and 5\u0001f\u0002 show the growth rates of indi-\nvidual modes, as predicted by linear analysis for the given\nparameters. The linear analysis estimates of \u0005max and n* are\n\u0005max=2.8\f10\u22123 and n*=0.92 \u0001parameter set 1\u0002 and \u0005max\n=0.12 and n*=5.9 \u0001parameter set 2\u0002.

The number of discretization points p takes the\nvalues 101, 401, 1001, and 4001. The plot shows that there is a\nmarked decrease in the growth rate of pattern as the number of\ndiscretization points increases. For illustration, an arbitrary thresh-\nold at which cells might respond to the activator is shown. In each\ncase, the final pattern developed was of the form of mode 1\n\u0001a gradient\u0002.\nPAGE, MONK, AND MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 76, 011902 \u00012007\u0002\n011902-6\nselected, however the mode which is selected has a growth\nrate only very slightly less than that of the fastest-growing\nmode. With different \u0001random\u0002 initial conditions the fastest-\ngrowing mode is selected \u0001see \u000313\u0004\u0002.\nWe can see in Fig. 6 that, in the initial linear phase, the\ngradient \u0001i.e., the exponential growth rate\u0002 of mode 6 is\ngreater than those of modes 5 and 7, which are greater than\nthat of mode 8, while mode 4 grows still more slowly. This\nagrees exactly with the linear analysis growth rates \u0003see Fig.\n5\u0001f\u0002\u0004 and leads to the selection of the mode 6 pattern.\nIn Fig. 5, the calculation of the gradient from the numeri-\ncal data is not very precise, but the estimates presented show\ngood agreement with the linear growth rates of the modes\ncorresponding to the final pattern. It is apparent also that \u0001in\nthese particular numerical simulations\u0002 the growth is never\nfaster than it is in this linear phase and hence that the linear\ngrowth rates bound the rate of pattern formation.\nThese results suggest that, typically, our linear analysis\nresults will hold. We find, however, that if the parameters are\nsuch that the system is very far from the Turing bifurcation,\nnonlinear interactions can lead to two effects which may\nspeed up the formation of few-peaked patterns.\nIV. PEAK COMPETITION\nIn the highly nonlinear regime far from bifurcation \u0001for\nexample, when the ratio of diffusion coefficients is very\nsmall\u0002, peaks, once formed, can compete with one another\nand some may be annihilated. The modes that initially grow\nfrom the uniform steady state are those with large linear\ngrowth rates. As we have seen, the growth rates of the fastest\nmodes are not limited by the diffusion rates, provided the\nratio of diffusion coefficients is very small, and so the\ngrowth of these modes may be very fast. The pattern, having\nattained sufficient amplitude, may then reorganize such that\nit consists of only one or a few peaks. Providing that this\nreorganization is also fast, this process could lead to few-\npeaked patterns emerging in reaction diffusion systems in a\nshorter time than linear analysis suggests is possible. \u0001We\nassume that cells in the biological system only respond to\nhigh levels of activator concentration when those levels are\nsustained, so that the many transiently appearing peaks have\nno long term effect.\u0002\nFigure 7 shows an example of this phenomenon in a simu-\nlation of the Gierer-Meinhardt model. Figure 7\u0001a\u0002 shows an\nearly time plot of the activator concentration displaying\nmany peaks, while Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002 shows the long time activator\nprofile containing only two peaks \u0001the system takes a very\nlong time to reach steady state, but the number of peaks is\nstable by this stage and their positions change only slightly\non a very long time scale\u0002. Figure 7\u0001c\u0002 shows the natural\nlogarithm of the amplitude of the pattern and Fig. 7\u0001d\u0002 shows\nthe growth rates of modes predicted by linear analysis. This\nexample shows that linear analysis does not always predict\nthe final pattern; however it is not clear from Fig. 7\u0001c\u0002 that\nthe initial growth rate is much faster than the linear analysis\nprediction for mode 4 \u0001the two-peaked mode\u0002. Figure 7\u0001c\u0002\ndoes, however, reveal another way in which the system may\nexceed the growth rate predicted by linear analysis and we\ninvestigate this in the following section.\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\u22126\n\u22124\n\u22122\n0\n2\nt\n8\n7\n4\n6\n5\nln\n(A\n)\nFIG. 6.

ACCELERATED GROWTH\nThere is a regime of growth \u0003between about t=12 and t\n=16 in Fig. 7\u0001c\u0002\u0004, where the amplitude of the pattern grows\nat a faster rate than it does in the linear regime. Indeed, the\nrate reaches at least 1.3 which is several times faster than the\nlinear growth rate of the fastest growing mode \u00010.33 for\nmode 14\u0002. The average growth rate from t=1 to t=16 is 0.43,\nwhich again is faster than the linear growth rate of the fastest\ngrowing mode. At t=16, one of the peaks in the activator\nconcentration is well-established and the other, although still\ngrowing, is clearly discernible. This demonstrates that it is\npossible to establish a pattern in a shorter time than sug-\ngested by linear analysis. The accelerated regime of growth\nis clearly a nonlinear phenomenon. We now investigate why\nit occurs.\nIndividual modes only interact with one another via the\nnonlinear terms. We look at the growth profiles of their am-\nplitudes to see how they contribute to the accelerated growth.\nIn the example of Fig. 7, many modes have positive growth\nrates and the white noise in the initial conditions means that\neach of these modes is present in the system. Hence the\nnonlinear interactions between modes are very complex and\nmany modes contribute to the accelerated growth. We there-\nfore look at a simpler case, when the initial perturbation\nabout the homogeneous steady state is of a single wave num-\nber. We choose the wave number with maximal linear growth\nrate, that is a perturbation of the form cos\u000114\u0007x\u0002. We choose\nits amplitude to be 0.2% of the steady state value, which\nrepresents roughly the amount likely to be present in ap-\nproximately white noise with expected magnitude of 5% of\nthe steady state value on 1000 cells or with expected magni-\ntude 1.4% on 100 cells.\nFigure 8 shows the results of a simulation using these\ninitial conditions. As before, we observe accelerated growth\n\u0001although it is not as marked as in the previous simulations\u0002\nfollowed by peak competition. Figure 8\u0001a\u0002 shows the regime\nof accelerated growth. The average growth rate between t\n=19 and t=20 is 0.49 and overall between t=1 and t=20 it is\n0.36. Both of these values are higher than the maximum\nlinear growth rate \u00010.33\u2014the growth rate of the mode\npresent in the initial conditions\u0002. The acceleration becomes\nevident when the pattern amplitude is about 0.05, which is\n4% of the steady state value. During the period of acceler-\nated growth, simulations show that the only modes present\n\u0001at any significant level\u0002 are the initial mode \u0003cos\u000114\u0007x\u0002\u0004 and\nits harmonics \u0003cos\u000128\u0007x\u0002, cos\u000142\u0007x\u0002, etc.\u0004 The pattern dur-\ning this period consists of seven growing peaks. Later, how-\never, the peaks compete, as in the previous simulations, re-\nsulting in only 1.5 peaks\u0002. Thus the acceleration must be due\nto nonlinear harmonic excitations. The harmonics appear in\norder, the lowest wave number first\u2014so that to start with\nonly the initial mode is present, followed by its first har-\nmonic and so on.\nFigure 8\u0001b\u0002 shows the growth profile of the initial mode\nand its first three harmonics. Between t=18 and t=19, the\ngradient \u0001i.e., growth rate\u0002 of mode 14 is 0.34, of mode 28 is\n0.62, of mode 42 is 0.90, and of mode 56 is 1.18. Thus the\ngrowth rate of the mode is roughly proportional to its wave\nnumber. This result is in concordance with a set of hypoth-\neses for accelerated growth presented in Appendix D.\nVI.

As we have noted already,\ncare must be taken in using numerical simulation results to\ninfer exact timings of pattern formation. However, our aim\nhere is to infer rough timings and compare the time taken in\ndifferent regions of parameter space.\nFigure 9 shows example simulation results, in which the\nnumbers of peaks in the patterns at time t=500 are plotted\nagainst the values of a parameter of the system, the other\nparameters being held constant. The ranges of the parameter\nbeing varied are designed to give as broad a view of the\nTuring space as possible. The results shown are chosen, as\nfar as possible, to be representative. We conclude from these\nsimulation results that the number of peaks increases with \u0003.\nThe dependence on the other parameters is much weaker.\nChanging r has negligible effect on the number of peaks. The\ndependence on \u0002 is unclear, but it does not seem very\nmarked. Values of d near to bifurcation \u0001i.e., larger values\u0002\ntend to lead to slightly fewer peaks, but the effect is mar-\nginal. For a more detailed analysis of the effects on the pat-\ntern of the system parameters see \u000314\u0004.\nThus if we are interested in few-peaked patterns, we\nshould pick a small value of \u0003 \u0001i.e., a low inhibitor degrada-\ntion rate, although this should be higher than the activator\ndiffusion rate or the system will start to oscillate\u0002 and choose\nthe other parameters so that we are in the Turing space, per-\nhaps taking care that d is not too small. We now assess the\nimplications of this choice for the growth rates of the\npatterns.\nWe find from the results of simulations that we need a\nvalue of \u0003 less than about 0.5 to obtain a one-peaked pattern,\nwhich, by the linear analysis in Sec. II, shows that the maxi-\nmum linear growth rate is less than 0.5. When d is not too\nsmall there will be no regime of accelerated growth and so\nthis restriction on the linear growth rate will mean that the\npattern takes at least a time \u000f 10.5\u0003\n1\n2 ln\u0001\nm\n2 \u0002\u0004\u000f3.9 \u0001over ten\nhours\u0002 to be established \u0001see linear analysis section\u2014we as-\nsume the threshold level y is at least as high as the noise\nlevel x and that we have around 100 cells in our domain\u0002.\nHowever, if we make d very small \u0001for example 10\u22124, which\nis unlikely from a biological point of view\u0002, we can obtain a\nregime of accelerated growth. In Fig. 10, we use parameter\nvalues \u0003=0.4 and \u0002=0.3 \u0001about as large as possible to give\nrise to a one-peaked pattern\u0002. The figure shows that r has\nvery little effect on the growth profile, but that reducing d\ncan lead to accelerated growth. The pattern takes a time t\n\u000f3.6 \u0001which corresponds to 10 h\u0002 to reach 20% amplitude\nwhen d=10\u22124, with initial conditions uniformly distributed\nbetween \u00b110% noise on a domain of 100 cells, and a time\nt\u000f9.9 \u0001which corresponds to over 27 h\u0002 when d=0.01. Even\nwhen the pattern reaches the requisite amplitude it has not\nalways yet become single-peaked.\nWe have performed similar numerical simulations with\nSchnakenberg or depletion and glycolysis kinetics and both\nappear to be too slow to explain, for example, primitive\nstreak initiation.

Many-peaked patterns can be initiated\nmore rapidly.\nVII. EFFECT OF SPATIALLY VARYING PARAMETERS\nON PATTERNING SPEED\nIn the previous section, we established a link between the\nspeed of development of a pattern and its wavelength. Now,\nby varying the parameters of a reaction diffusion system, we\ncan move in and out of the Turing space. Thus if the param-\neters are allowed to vary in space, then in some sections of\nthe domain the parameters of the system may be within the\nTuring space and in others they may not. This can lead to\nsections of the domain becoming patterned, while others re-\nmain unpatterned \u000315,14\u0004. Specifically, if the parameters are\nsuch that on a small section of the domain a short wave-\nlength pattern develops rapidly, but on the remainder of the\ndomain no pattern forms, then this may give rise to a single-\npeaked or few-peaked pattern in a short time.\nFigure 11 shows an example of a simulation performed on\nan inhomogeneous domain of this type. Since there are two\ndistinct homogeneous steady state values, we cannot say\nwhen the pattern amplitude has reached y% of the steady\nstate value. However, it is well established before t=1, that\nis, before three hours have elapsed. We performed simula-\ntions with various initial conditions, setting the activator and\ninhibitor equal to the uniform steady state values on the left\nhand side, to the value on the right hand side and to the\nstep-function state. Varying amounts of noise were added to\nthese initial conditions. We found that by t=1, the solution\n\u0001still growing\u0002 was almost independent of the initial condi-\ntions. Thus with a spatially varying parameter, a one-peaked\npattern can be initiated in 3 h in a way that is not sensitively\ndependent on the details of the noise in the system\n\u0001and hence on the number of cells\u0002.\nThe use of a spatially varying parameter, however, pushes\nback the problem to explaining the patterning of that param-\neter. It is clear, though, that in embryonic development the\npatterning is sequential and all but the first patterning events\ntake place in a domain which already has some structure\n\u0001i.e., a \u201cprepattern\u201d\u0002. The importance of these hierarchies of\npattern was noted by Turing \u000311\u0004. Our simulations demon-\nstrate that secondary patterning in a reaction diffusion system\ncan be considerably faster than patterning de novo. It is also\nclear that parameter values can be influenced by external\nphysical factors in a much more obvious way than can the\nconcentrations of gene products directly. For example, before\nthe initiation of the primitive streak in the chick embryo\nappears to have started, there is already a bias in the embryo.\nThe cell density in the posterior is greater than that in the\nanterior and this is thought to be due to the effects of gravity\nwhen the egg is tilted \u0001rendering the presumptive posterior of\nthe embryo uppermost\u0002 in the oviduct \u0001see \u000316\u0004\u0002. If we were\nto suppose that the activator was produced at a given rate per\ncell then this would naturally lead to a preexisting gradient in\nan activator production parameter.\nIn Fig. 11, the activator pattern is much sharper than the\noriginal parameter inhomogeneity. This shows that it is pos-\nsible for secondary patterns to refine and sharpen the existing\nstructure of the biological system. This secondary pattern\ndoes not, however, lend itself to regulation, which is an es-\nsential feature of many patterning processes during embry-\nonic development. If much of the domain has parameters\noutside the Turing space, then, in isolation, those sections\nwill not regenerate pattern unless the underlying pattern in\nthe parameter itself regulates.\nWe note that an alternative to having prepatterned param-\neters in the reaction diffusion system is to have boundary\nconditions that somehow force the patterning. Thus, for ex-\nample, boundary conditions that are inconsistent with the\nhomogeneous steady state can also speed up patterning.\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\nAccording to linear analysis in a two-component Turing\nsystem, the time taken for the establishment of a pattern with\nk half peaks from initial state of a small perturbation about\nthe uniform steady state is at least AL2 \/ \u0001Dvk2\u0002, where A is a\nconstant depending on the kinetic parameters of the system,\nthe details of the initial conditions and the amplitude that the\npattern has to reach. So, according to linear analysis, the time\ntaken to establish a pattern has a very similar form to that for\ngradient formation by simple diffusion \u00032\u0004. This also shows\nthat the time taken depends on the wavelength of the\npattern\u2014long wavelength patterns are slow to develop.\nThe details of the noise in the initial conditions are im-\nportant in determining the time taken for a pattern to de-\nvelop.

Only for x\n0.1 does the system lie\nwithin the Turing space.

The bounds obtained from linear analysis will\ntherefore usually bound above the rate of patterning of the\nfull nonlinear system.\nFar from bifurcation two phenomena occur which mean\nthat the linear bounds do not apply: \u0001i\u0002 peak competition\u2014a\nrapidly growing short wavelength pattern may appear ini-\ntially, but then the peaks compete and some are annihilated;\n\u0001ii\u0002 accelerated growth\u2014nonlinear mode interactions can\ncause a regime of growth which is faster than the initial\ngrowth in the linear regime.\nDespite the fact that bounds from linear theory do not\nalways apply, simulations show that if the diffusion coeffi-\ncients are small, then the patterns can be fast-growing only if\nthey have short wavelength. It seems that straightforward\nreaction diffusion systems cannot explain fast long wave-\nlength patterning in biological systems, such as is required in\nthe initiation of the primitive streak.\nIf the parameters of the reaction diffusion system have a\ndependence on space, then a single peak or few-peaked pat-\ntern can be established rapidly \u0001see \u000313,15,14\u0004\u0002. Nature em-\nploys a variety of strategies to ensure that patterning typi-\ncally takes place on a domain which already has some spatial\nstructure. Embryonic development involves a hierarchy of\npatterning and reaction diffusion may be able to explain\nrapid secondary patterning of a long wavelength, although it\ncannot explain rapid de novo patterning.\nIn this paper, we have focused on a few aspects of the\npatterning process which affect the speed of formation of\npatterns. We chose to focus on a few well-studied kinetic\nschemes. Future research might consider how to generalize\nthe ideas we have proposed to other kinetic schemes and to\nconsider other aspects of the patterning process and how they\naffect the speed of patterning.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nK.M.P. acknowledges the Joint Research Councils\n\u0001EPSRC, BBSRC, and MRC\u0002 for a Lectureship in Bioinfor-\nmatics.
