Res., 111, A07206, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011559.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Geomagnetic storms represent the largest disturbances\nin the magnetosphere. They have effects on a number of\nphenomena that impact the space environment and thus our\ntechnology-dependent society. The primary cause of storms\nis a southward directed interplanetary magnetic field (IMF),\nBs, when it is both large and prolonged [e.g., Gonzalez et\nal., 1994, and references therein; Zhang et al., 2006],\nreconnecting the geomagnetic field at the dayside magne-\ntopause. This dayside magnetic reconnection increases the\npenetration of the solar wind motional electric field\nE \u00bc \u0003V\u0004 B;\nwhere V is the solar wind velocity and B is the IMF vector,\ninto the magnetosphere [e.g., Gonzalez et al., 1994, and\nreferences therein; Zhang et al., 2001]. Consequently, the\nlarge-scale plasma convection in the magnetosphere is\nenhanced [e.g., Dungey, 1961; Rostoker and Fa\u00a8lthammar,\n1967; Burton et al., 1975; Akasofu, 1981; Gonzalez et al.,\n1989; Rostoker et al., 1997]. The magnetospheric convec-\ntion is actually a bulk flow of charged particles both down\nthe magnetotail (associated with the motion of the\nreconnected magnetic fields) and toward the midtail plasma\nsheet from the plasma mantle [Pilipp and Morfill, 1976;\nCowley and Southwood, 1980] and from the low-latitude\nboundary layer (LLBL) [Spence and Kivelson, 1993;\nFujimoto et al., 1996]. At the same time, in the plasma\nsheet, the sunward convective flow (the so-called \u2018\u2018E-cross-\nB drift\u2019\u2019) also intensifies.\n[3] The plasma sheet is a magnetospheric region which\nextends from the near-equatorial magnetotail to the geosyn-\nchronous orbit, separating the two tail lobes and typically\n2\u20136 Earth radii (RE) thick; it is filled with a layer of dense\nand hot plasma in the 0.3\u20133.0 cm\u00033 and keV range\n[Baumjohann et al., 1989; Baumjohann, 1993]. During\nstorms, the plasma sheet, together with the plasma sheet\nboundary layer (PSBL) [Borovsky et al., 1998a], plays a\ncrucial role in the mass transport and energy transfer from\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, A07206, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011559, 2006\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Space Physics Research Laboratory, University of Michigan, Ann\nArbor, Michigan, USA.\n2Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JA011559$09.00\nA07206 1 of 16\nthe solar wind into the magnetosphere [Gonzalez et al.,\n1994; Borovsky et al., 1997b, 1998b]. In the main phase of a\nstorm, the plasma sheet can have access to the geosynchro-\nnous orbit and then the inner magnetosphere [Korth et al.,\n1999; Korth and Thomsen, 2001; Friedel et al., 2001];\ncharged particles in the near-Earth plasma sheet are ener-\ngized and injected deep (L < 4) into the inner magneto-\nsphere; an intensified ring current, monitored by\ngeomagnetic indices like the Dst index, is therefore pro-\nduced. It is believed that the direct source for storms is the\nplasma sheet [e.g., Smith et al., 1979; Chen et al., 1994;\nKozyra et al., 1998b; Korth et al., 1999; Ebihara et al.,\n2005; Denton et al., 2005, 2006].\n[4] The geosynchronous orbit, located at approximately\n6.62 RE geocentric distance in the geographical equatorial\nplane, is an altitude at the transition from the magnetotail\nplasma sheet to the storm-time ring current [e.g., Thomsen\net al., 1998a, 2003; Denton et al., 2005, 2006]. Plasma\nobservations at geosynchronous orbit are especially useful\nin exploring the sources of the storm-time ring current\nparticles. Among those observations are plasma measure-\nments by the Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzers (MPA)\n[Bame et al., 1993; McComas et al., 1993] on board as\nmany as seven Los Alamos geosynchronous satellites.\nThese multisatellite measurements make it possible to\ndescribe both the spatial and temporal variations of plasma\nparameters at geosynchronous orbit.\n[5] The interplanetary and solar origins of storms have\nsolar cycle variation and are dependent on different phases\nof the solar cycle [e.g., Gonzalez et al., 1999, and references\ntherein]. Furthermore, the plasma properties at geosynchro-\nnous orbit are found to be highly correlated with the\nproperties of the solar wind plasma [Geiss et al., 1978;\nSharp et al., 1982; Borovsky et al., 1998a]. Thus it is\nexpected that the properties of geosynchronous-orbit plasma\nhave strong solar cycle dependence as well [Denton et al.,\n2005].\n[6] In the present study, we take advantage of the abun-\ndant ion observations of more than one solar cycle (1989\u2013\npresent) in the MPA data sets to extend previous MPA data\nanalyses by Maurice et al. [1998], Korth et al. [1999], and\nDenton et al. [2005, 2006]. The pitch-angle averaged ion\nfluxes as well as the moments (e.g., density and tempera-\nture) and their derivatives are used in our statistical analysis.\nHowever, only storm-time MPA data at the two solar\nextrema, solar maximum and solar minimum, are extracted\nfrom the abundant MPA data sets. In addition, we consider\nonly high-energy ions (denoted by \u2018\u2018hot ions\u2019\u2019) with an\nenergy range from 0.1 keV to 45 keV, which carry most of\nthe geosynchronous-orbit plasma pressure. Note that 45 keV\nis a reasonable upper limit of the ion energy range at\ngeosynchronous orbit. Although the ion energy in the ring\ncurrent can be as high as 200 keV, the typical location of the\nstorm-time ring current is lower than the geostationary\ndistance, i.e., <6.62 RE.\n[7] The criteria of choosing solar extrema and storm\nevents are the same as those in this study\u2019s companion\npaper by Zhang et al. [2006], who made a statistical\ncomparison of solar wind sources of 549 storms at solar\nminimum and at solar maximum of the latest three solar\ncycles. Because MPA data are available only from 1989,\nstorm events at the solar extrema of Solar Cycle 21 and 22\nare not included in this study; on the basis of the monthly\naverages of sunspot numbers, the 3-year time period of July\n1994 to June 1997 (July 1999 to June 2002) in Solar Cycle\n23 is selected as solar minimum (solar maximum). As in the\nwork of Zhang et al. [2006], all storms, defined by the\npressure corrected Dst index (Dst*; see below), are classi-\nfied into intense (min. Dst* \u0005 \u0003100 nT) and moderate\n(\u0003100 nT < min. Dst* \u0005 \u000350 nT) [Gonzalez et al., 1994].\nThe purpose of this paper is to establish and compare the\naverage behaviors of storm-time hot-ion properties at geo-\nsynchronous orbit in the four storm categories and to\nunderstand these characteristics in the context of the solar\nwind drivers [Zhang et al., 2006].\n2. Data Processing\n2.1. Geosynchronous-Orbit Plasma Observations:\nMPA Instrument\n[8] Plasma observations at geosynchronous orbit are\nobtained from the magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA)\ninstruments on board the six of seven Los Alamos National\nLaboratory (LANL) satellites. The satellite 1989-046 is\nexcluded in this study because of large data gaps; the six\ngeosynchronous satellites selected are 1990-095, 1991-080,\n1994-084, LANL-97A, LANL-01A, and LANL-02A,\nwhose launch year is denoted by the number before (after)\nthe dash in the \u2018\u2018international designators\u2019\u2019 of the first (last)\nthree satellites. These satellites are located nearly in the\ngeographic equatorial plane and make observations at\ndifferent geographic longitudes. Bame et al. [1993] de-\nscribed the detailed MPA design and its operating character-\nistics, and the capabilities and typical observations of the\nMPA instruments were first demonstrated by McComas et\nal. [1993]. The MPA instrument is a spherical-sector elec-\ntrostatic analyzer with a bending angle of 60\u0001, which\nmeasures three-dimensional distributions of both ions and\nelectrons on timescales of \u000186 s. The energy ranges from\n\u00011 eV\/e up to \u000140 keV\/e in 40 levels. Spin-averaged fluxes\n(fs) in every energy channel and several velocity moments\n(e.g., number density Ns, velocity vector us, three-dimen-\nsional temperature matrix Ts) of the measured three-dimen-\nsional plasma distributions can be calculated [Thomsen et\nal., 1996a, 1999],\nNs \u00bc\nZ\nf vs\u00f0 \u00ded3vs\nus \u00bc 1\nNs\nZ\nvs f vs\u00f0 \u00ded3vs\nTs \u00bc 1\nNs\nZ\nms vs \u0003 us\u00f0 \u00de vs \u0003 us\u00f0 \u00def vs\u00f0 \u00ded3vs\nwhere f(vs) is the measured phase space density of a species\ns (electron or ion) at a velocity vs, d\n3vs is the velocity-space\nvolume element, and ms is the particle mass. Under the\nassumption of a gyrotropic distribution, two of the three\neigenvalues of Ts are similar to each other. The average of\nthe two eigenvalues is taken as perpendicular temperature\nTs,per which is in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield. The eigenvector associated with the third eigenvalue,\nthe most different one, shows the magnetic field direction.\nThe third eigenvalue is identified as parallel temperature\nTs,par along the magnetic field direction. Magnetic field\nA07206 ZHANG ET AL.: HOT-ION PROPERTIES DURING STORMS\n2 of 16\nA07206\ndirection is identified by a velocity distribution minimum in\nflux in the high-energy channels (i.e., a loss cone\ndistribution).\n[9] Because the MPA instruments measure only energy\nper charge and thus cannot distinguish the composition of\npositively charged particles, we assume that all ions are\nprotons. Moreover, ions detected by MPA have a distinct\npopulation separation at the energy level of \u0001100 eV\n[McComas et al., 1993]. The low-energy (\u0005100 eV) ion\npopulations are believed to originate from the ionosphere\n[e.g., Reasoner et al., 1983;Moldwin et al., 1994], while the\nhigh-energy (>100 eV) ones are those in the inner plasma\nsheet [e.g., Gurnett and Frank, 1974; Garrett et al., 1981]\nor in the ring current [e.g., Balsiger et al., 1980]. In the\npresent paper, we study the average behaviors of fluxes in\nfour energy channels (f with energies \u000130, \u000118, \u00017, and\n\u00011 keV) and several derived bulk properties of hot ions\nbefore and during storm events. The ion bulk parameters\ninclude number density (N), total temperature (T = (Tpar +\n2Tper)\/3), entropy (measured by T\/N\ng\u00031; g is the heat\ncapacity ratio equal to 5\/3), and temperature anisotropy\n(A = Tper\/Tpar). The intervals of the magnetosheath and low-\nlatitude boundary layer are excluded in our MPA database\nby limiting the number density and perpendicular temper-\nature of hot ions [Korth et al., 1999],\n0:3 cm\u00033 < N < 3 cm\u00033\nTper > 2 keV:\n2.2. Pressure Corrected Dst (Dst*) and Event Selection\n[10] The hourly Dst index corrected by the solar wind\ndynamic pressure (Dst*) is used to identify storm events\n(peak Dst* \u0005 \u000350 nT) in the present study. With the\nmagnetopause current effect removed, Dst* contains mainly\nthe contribution of the ring current. The formula (Dst* = Dst\n\u0003 7.26Pdyn1\/2 + 11.0, where Pdyn is solar wind dynamic\npressure in nPa) given by O\u2019Brien and McPherron [2000]\nis used to compute Dst*. If Pdyn is missing, Dst* cannot be\ncomputed and we replace it with Dst to define a storm.\n[11] Similar to Figure 2 of Zhang et al. [2006], Figure 1\nshows the number of moderate and intense storm events at\nthe selected solar minimum and solar maximum of Solar\nCycle 23. In total, 164 storms, 67 at solar minimum and 97\nat solar maximum (44 intense storms and 120 moderate\nstorms), are identified and analyzed in this study. The 164\nDst*-storms are classified into four categories according to\nstorm intensity and solar activity: 34 intense storms at solar\nmaximum, 10 intense storms at solar minimum, 63 moder-\nate storms at solar maximum, and 57 moderate storms at\nsolar minimum. Apparently, storms at solar maximum\nappear more frequently than those at solar minimum;\nparticularly, intense storms at solar maximum are more than\nthree times as many as those at solar minimum.\n[12] Figure 2 shows the density distribution of the two\nlevels of storm intensity at the two solar extrema. In each\nFigure 1. Histogram of the number of moderate and\nintense storm events at solar minimum (July 1994\u2013June\n1997) and solar maximum (July 1999\u2013June 2002). The\ntotal of storms is parenthesized in the figure title. The\nnumbers in other parentheses indicate the subtotal of storms\nin each category.\nFigure 2. Density distribution of intense storms (upper)\nand moderate storms (lower) at solar maximum and at solar\nminimum.

The minimum Dst* (Dst*min) values of the\ntwo most intense storms at solar minimum reached only\n\u0003131.6 nT and \u0003154.2 nT. The intensity of all other intense\nstorms at solar minimum is >\u0003125 nT. As for the 34 intense\nstorms at solar maximum, six of them are super-storms\n(Dst*min \u0005 \u0003250 nT).\n3. Data Analysis\n[13] Superposed epoch analyses of the four energy-\nchannel fluxes and four derived bulk parameters of hot\nions at geosynchronous orbit are performed for each of the\nfour storm categories: intense storms at solar maximum,\nintense storms at solar minimum, moderate storms at solar\nmaximum, and moderate storms at solar minimum. In the\ncompanion work, Zhang et al. [2006] used the same\nstatistical technique to study the average behaviors of\nsolar wind plasma and IMF parameters, NOAA\/POES\nHemispheric Power, Kp, and Dst* in the four storm\ncategories with storms in Solar Cycle 21 and 22 also\nincluded.\n[14] Dst*min is taken as the zero epoch of the superposed\nepoch analyses and the time domain is \u00b11.5 days. In other\nwords, the epoch time period is from 1 1\/2 days before\nDst*min to 1 1\/2 days afterward. For each storm category, the\neight MPA parameters observed by all the six LANL\nsatellites, as a function of local time (LT) and universal\ntime (UT), are grouped into 1-hour square bins, respectively.\nThe MPA values in each LT-UT bin are then averaged.\n[15] From top to bottom, Figure 3 shows the superposed\nepoch averages of the base-10 logarithms, denoted by \u2018\u2018log\u2019\u2019\nin the text below, of the fluxes f (with energies \u000130, \u000117,\n\u00018, and \u00011 keV), and linear scales for the number density\nN, temperature T, entropy T\/Ng\u00031, and temperature anisot-\nropy Tper\/Tpar of hot ions before and during intense storms\nat solar maximum. The vertical dotted line denotes the zero\nepoch, Dst*min. The means, medians, first quartiles, and third\nquartiles of Dst* are also shown in the last panel. The\naveraged MPA data are color coded in the local time versus\nuniversal time plots (LT-UT maps) because LT-UT maps are\na good method of displaying the large amounts of MPA\ndata. Statistics like standard deviations and quartiles from\nthe superposed epoch analyses of the MPA parameters are\nnot shown but can be provided upon request from the\nauthors. On the LT-UT maps, bins with missing data are\ncolored white, and black (purple) bins indicate that the\nvalues are lower (higher) than the minimum (maximum) of\nthe corresponding color bar. Between the two horizontal\ndotted lines on the LT-UT maps of the MPA data is the\nnightside, that is, 1800 LT to 0600 LT which is centered\naround midnight.\n[16] Similarly, Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the results of the\nsuperposed epoch analyses in the other three storm catego-\nries, respectively. For convenience in making comparisons,\nthe range of the color bar in every MPA LT-UT map and the\nY axis ranges in the Dst* panels are the same among\nFigures 3\u20136. In Figure 4, because of large geosynchro-\nnous-orbit observation gaps due to only ten intense storms\nat solar minimum, white bins on the LT-UT maps of the\nMPA data are filled with linearly smoothed values which are\ncomputed by the following algorithm:\nSi \u00bc\n1\nw\nXw\u00031\nj\u00bc0\nMi\u00fej\u0003w\n2\n; i \u00bc w\u0003 1\n2\n; . . . ; n\u0003 w\u00fe 1\n2\nMi; otherwise\n8><\n>:\nwhere Mi is the averaged MPA parameter value in the ith LT\nor UT bin on an LT-UT map, n is the total of LT or UT bins\non the LT-UT map, w is the width of the smoothed window,\nand Si is the smoothed result of Mi. Thus the smoothing\nformula is applied for both LT and UT bins. If a neighbor\nbin is found to be outside the LT-UT map, values in the\nnearest edge bin are used to compute the smoothed results.\nIn our calculation, w is set to 5; however, there are still\nwhite areas (no data available) in the LT-UT maps of\nFigure 4 when the gap was larger than w.\n[17] Table 1 quantitatively gives the average peak values\nof hot-ion parameters at geosynchronous orbit and Dst*min\nin the four storm categories. After each mean is the\ncorresponding standard deviation. Detailed comparisons of\nthose peak values will be made in the following text.\n[18] To test the statistical significance of the means in\nFigures 3\u20136, we calculate the Student\u2019s t-statistic and its\nsignificance [Reiff, 1990] for each MPA parameter in every\n1-hour LT-UT bin among the four storm categories. Zhang\net al. [2006] also made the same Student\u2019s t-test calculations\non all IMF and solar wind plasma parameters and geomag-\nnetic indices like Dst*, Kp, and NOAA\/POES Hemispheric\nPower.

The means of x and y are considered to be\nsignificantly different if p < 0.05 [Miller, 1986; Press et al.,\n1992]. However, the Student\u2019s t-test assumes that x and y\nhave the same true variance. If x and y have very different\nvariances, the difference of x and y may be difficult to\ninterpret [Press et al., 1992].\n[19] Results from the Student\u2019s t-test show that visual\ninspection is good enough to determine whether features on\nthe LT-UT maps are statistically different (p < 0.05). One\npossible reason is that means in most of those 1-hour LT-UT\nbins are calculated from as many as 1500 data points\nbecause of the richness of the MPA database. Note that\nthe MPA data resolution is \u000186 s. Similar to Table 1 of\nZhang et al. [2006], Table 2 lists some results of the\nStudent\u2019s t-test for the peaks of each hot-ion parameter\nbetween half a day before and after Dst*min during intense\nstorms and moderate storms between the two solar extrema,\nrespectively. If peaks do not appear in the same bin on an\nLT-UT map, which is true in most cases, the Student\u2019s t-test\nis done for the peak value at solar maximum and the\nnonpeak value at the same local time and universal time\nat solar minimum. If peaks are found to be different from\neach other by eye, then the t-statistic significance, p, is\nalways far smaller than 0.05, as shown in Table 2.\n4. Results: Similarities and Differences\n4.1. Similarities\n[20] Figures 3\u20136 demonstrate the typical features of four\ndifferent energy channels of fluxes, density, temperature,\ntemperature anisotropy, and entropy of geosynchronous-\norbit hot ions and the Dst* statistics (means, medians, first\nand third quartiles from the superposed epoch analysis)\nprior to and during intense storms and moderate storms at\nsolar maximum and at solar minimum, respectively. Some\nfeatures of the hot-ion parameters are in agreement with\nprevious studies [e.g., McIlwain, 1972; Borovsky et al.,\n1997a, 1997b; Borovsky et al., 1998b; Kozyra et al.,\n1998b; Thomsen et al., 1998a, 1998b, 2003; Wing and\nNewell, 1998; Korth et al., 1999; Korth and Thomsen,\n2001; Friedel et al., 2001; Fok et al., 2003; Ebihara and\nFok, 2004; Ebihara et al., 2005; Denton et al., 2005, 2006],\nwhile others are presented here for the first time. The Dst*\npanel is shown only for reference. Zhang et al. [2006] have\nreported the similarities and differences of Dst* in the four\nstorm categories. Table 3 outlines the similarities, discussed\nin detail as follows, on the LT-UT maps of the four storm\ntypes for each hot-ion parameter.\n[21] As shown in the LT-UT maps of Figures 3\u20136, during\nthe epoch time period of 3 days, all the geosynchronous-\norbit hot-ion parameters vary with both local time (LT) and\nuniversal time (UT). In other words, each of them is a\nfunction of LT and UT. Moreover, during the average main\nphase and the early average recovery phase (about half a\nTable 1.

They display obvious regions of increase or de-\ncrease and show distinct peaks or minima. Furthermore, the\nlocations of these increase or decrease patterns do not\nchange much with levels of geomagnetic activity either at\nsolar maximum or at solar minimum. These storm-time\ndisturbances of the hot-ion parameters are in response to the\nenhancement of upstream IMF components, solar wind\nplasma parameters, and motional electric field in the four\nstorm categories as presented by Zhang et al. [2006]: (1) the\nsouthward IMF Bz and associated electric field exceed a key\nthreshold value for a long duration; (2) the IMF magnitude\nis enhanced and the three IMF components are all disturbed;\nand (3) the solar wind density, bulk flow speed, dynamic\npressure, and temperature begin to increase several hours\nbefore Dst*min. Corresponding geomagnetic activity in each\nstorm category is also consistently exhibited in the average\nbehaviors of NOAA\/POES Hemispheric Power, Kp, and\nDst* during storms [Zhang et al., 2006].\n[22] As one can see on the first panels of Figures 3\u20136, the\nion fluxes for the higher-energy channel (\u000130 keV) are\nenhanced during almost the whole nightside in the main\nphase. However, when the channel energy drops from\n\u000117 keV, \u00018 keV, to \u00011 keV, the enhancement begins to\nshift close to the dawnside and extend into the early\nrecovery phase. The regions with low fluxes (blue or black\nbins) also change from the morning sector at higher energies\nto the afternoon sector at \u00011 keV. Especially, at an energy\nof \u0001 1 keV, ion flux rates near dawn are unusually higher\nthan those near dusk during half a day before and after\nDst*min; however, a few hours after Dst*min, the ion fluxes at\n\u000130 keV are higher on the duskside than on the dawnside.\nIn addition, one can see higher peak flux rates in the\nlower-energy channels, which is also shown in Table 1.\nThe only exception is found during intense storms at solar\nminimum; the averaged log flux at 17 keV, which is 3.12\n(flux unit: cm\u00032s\u00031sr\u00031eV\u00031) as in Table 1, is larger than\nthat at 8 keV, 3.03, but they are statistically the same if the\nstandard deviations, 0.05 and 0.12, respectively, are con-\nsidered. Another interesting aspect of the hot-ion fluxes is\nthat in the earlier recovery phase the flux rates in every\nchannel are low in the premidnight sector. This feature is\nmore obvious during intense storms than during moderate\nstorms; it is not apparent during moderate storms at solar\nmaximum.\n[23] As shown on the fifth LT-UT map of Figures 3\u20136,\nhot-ion density is enhanced 24 hours before and after Dst*min\nin each type of storm. The density enhancement also has LT\ndependence; it always falls off close to noon. Furthermore,\nin the early morning sector and the postmidnight sector\n(midnight\u20130900 LT) and for a UT interval, 12 hours before\nand after Dst*min, the hot ions are extraordinarily dense, with\naverage peak values as high as 1.47 cm\u00033 for moderate\nstorms and 2.92 cm\u00033 for intense storms. This feature\nmakes the hot-ion density have a clear asymmetric LT\ndistribution around Dst*min during storms, which is also\nnoted by several previous studies [e.g., Korth et al., 1999;\nLiemohn et al., 2001; Fok et al., 2003; Ebihara et al., 2005;\nDenton et al., 2005, 2006].

This quiet-time LT variation is consistent with\nthose in the first and last 12 epoch hours on the density LT-\nUT maps in Figures 3\u20136.\n[24] From 0300 to 1100 LT (through dawn; total 8 local\nhours), hot-ion temperature is generally lower than that at\nother local times during almost the entire 3-day epoch time.\nInterestingly, each temperature LT-UT map of Figures 3\u20136\nshows a very cool region at 0700\u20131000 LT and \u00b14-hour\nepoch time centered atDst*min. The temperature can be as low\nas 2.60, 2.31, 4.12, and 3.62 keV in this region, compared to\npeak values at 9.65, 13.59, 9.77, and 10.35 keV in\nTable 1 for intense storms at solar maximum, intense storms\nat solar minimum, moderate storms at solar maximum,\nand moderate storms at solar minimum, respectively.\n[25] Hot-ion entropy has similar LT-UT maps to those of\ntemperature. That is, the temperature and the entropy are\nalmost consistently higher in the 12-hour LT sector centered\nat dusk than the 8-hour LT sector centered at 0700 LT.\nNevertheless, during intense storms either at solar maxi-\nmum or at solar minimum, the regions of low entropy are\neven more remarkable than the regions of low temperature\nbecause entropy is calculated from T\/Ng\u00031 and, as discussed\nabove, hot-ion density has distinct enhancements near\ndawnside around Dst*min. As shown in Table 1, the lowest\nentropy during intense storms is 1.88 keV\/cm\u00032 at solar\nmaximum and 0.88 keV\/cm\u00032 at solar minimum, but it is\n3.87 keV\/cm\u00032 and 4.17 keV\/cm\u00032 during moderate storms\nat solar maximum and at solar minimum, respectively.\n[26] Temperature anisotropy also has two prominent\nfeatures. One feature is that Tper\/Tpar is significantly re-\nduced during disturbed times on the nightside with a\nminimum near midnight. That is, Tper\/Tpar is low (=\u00011)\non the entire nightside in the main phase and the early\nrecovery phase. In other words, at geosynchronous orbit,\nisotropic hot ions extend across the nightside during storms,\nbut they become anisotropic (Tper\/Tpar > 1) close to noon.\nThe other feature is thatTper\/Tpar in the morning sector is\nusually larger than that in the afternoon sector in each storm\ncategory.\n[27] As the storm driver, a southward IMF, becomes\nweaker and has a northward turning in the end [Zhang et\nal., 2006], the large-scale magnetospheric convection is\nreduced and the mass and energy transport from the solar\nwind to the magnetosphere decreases. Finally, in the late\nrecovery phase (the last 24 hours of the 3-day epoch time),\nalmost all enhanced or decreased hot-ion parameters recover\nto their prestorm levels when various losses, such as charge\nexchange, atmospheric losses, Coulomb collisions, etc.\n[e.g., Kistler et al., 1989; Fok et al., 1991; Jordanova et\nal., 1996; Kozyra et al., 1998a], remove energetic particles\nfrom the ring current.\n4.2. Differences\n[28] In addition to having many features in common, the\nLT-UT maps in Figures 3\u20136 also illustrate the differences of\nthe average variations of the four energy-channel flux rates,\ndensity, temperature, temperature anisotropy, and entropy of\ngeosynchronous-orbit hot ions among the four storm cate-\ngories. Consistent with the average solar wind conditions\n[Zhang et al., 2006], the disturbance intensity and LT and\nUT distributions of the hot-ion parameters have dependence\non the levels of geomagnetic activity and solar activity.\nTable 3 also outlines the differences, discussed in detail as\nfollows, on the LT-UT maps of the four storm types for each\nhot-ion parameter.\n[29] The exact location (both LT and UT) and value of the\npeaks or minima change with levels of storm intensity either\nat solar maximum or at solar minimum. For example, during\nintense storms at solar maximum, the log fluxes at the\nenergy of \u000130 keV peak at 2.55 4 hours earlier than Dst*min\nin the postmidnight sector (at LT = 0400, precisely).\nHowever, the log fluxes in the same channel during intense\nstorms at solar minimum have a peak value of 2.61 between\ndusk and local midnight. In the 1-hour LT-UT bin where\nintense storms at solar maximum have the flux maximum at\n\u000130 keV, the log fluxes at the same energy in the other three\nstorm classes are relatively low: 2.31 during intense storms\nat solar minimum, 2.10 during moderate storms at solar\nmaximum, and 1.88 during moderate storms at solar mini-\nmum. The Student\u2019s t-tests indicate that 2.55 is significantly\ndifferent from these values: t = 3.43 and p = 9.88E-4 (also\nlisted in Table 2), t = 5.95 and p = 1.16E-8, and t = 2.35 and\np = 2.07E-2, respectively, at a confidence level of nearly\n100%.\n[30] On the flux LT-UT maps of Figures 3\u20136, one can see\nthat intense storms at solar minimum have the most extended\nincrease regions of fluxes at \u000130 and \u000117 keV in the\nmain phase and the early recovery phase; however, the\nextent of increase regions of fluxes at \u00018 keV during\nintense storms at solar maximum is comparable to that\nduring intense storms at solar minimum. As far as the last\nchannel is concerned, it is obvious that the most extended\nincrease regions at \u00011 keVare on the LT-UT map of intense\nstorms at solar maximum. As shown in Table 1, even\nthough intense storms at solar minimum are not on average\nthe most intense [Zhang et al., 2006], i.e., the averaged\nDst*min is larger than that of intense storms at solar maxi-\nmum by more than 50 nT, the averaged peak value of log\nflux at \u000130 keV, 2.61, is the highest in the four categories.\nThis is true in the other three channels of fluxes; intense\nstorms at solar minimum always have the highest average\nflux rates at \u000117 keV, \u00018 keV, and \u00011 keV. The second\nlargest fluxes in all the four channels are always around\nDst*min of intense storms at solar maximum. As for moderate\nstorms, like their similar averaged Dst*min [Zhang et al.,\n2006], the peak flux rates in each channel are not much\ndifferent from each other.\n[31] Although the dawnside enhancement regions of the\nhot-ion density during intense storms at solar maximum are\nmost extended among the four storm classes, the highest\ndensity peak is found in intense storms at solar minimum,\n2.33 cm\u00033. As shown in Table 1, the average density peak\nvalues during intense storms are higher than those during\nmoderate storms by 0.9 cm\u00033 at solar maximum and by\n1.5 cm\u00033 at solar minimum. Density during moderate\nstorms at solar minimum not only has the lowest peak\nvalue but also is less enhanced in the whole 3-day epoch\ntime (more blue and black bins in Figure 5) than other storm\ncategories. The possible reason is that moderate storms at\nsolar minimum are the weakest and have the smallest\nA07206 ZHANG ET AL.: HOT-ION PROPERTIES DURING STORMS\n11 of 16\nA07206\nabsolute value of the average Dst*min among the four types\nof storm as indicated in Table 1. In Figure 3, one can see\nanother special feature of intense storms at solar minimum:\ndensity, as well as fluxes at \u000130, \u000117, and \u00018 keV, exhibits\nanother peak near dusk in the middle of the main phase.\n[32] On the nightside and in the afternoon sector, geo-\nsynchronous-orbit-altitude ions in the main phase and\nrecovery phase of intense storms at solar minimum are\ngenerally the hottest in those enhanced temperature regions,\nmore red and purple bins, among the four storm categories.\nThesecondhottesthot-ionregionsarealso, surprisingly, found\nduring the other type of solar minimum storm, i.e., moderate\nstorms at solar minimum. As a matter of fact, one can not see\nsignificant temperature enhancements during solar maximum\nstorms, especially during intense storms at solar maximum.\nPeak temperature values given in Table 1 further confirm this\ndifference: 9.65 keV during intense storms at solarmaximum,\n13.59 keV during intense storms at solar minimum, 9.77 keV\nduring moderate storms at solar maximum, and 10.38 keV\nduring moderate storms at solar minimum.\n[33] A very similar feature can also be found in entropy\non the LT-UT maps of Figures 3\u20136. Moreover, as shown in\nTable 1, the average entropy during intense storms at\nsolar minimum, 25.51 keV\/cm\u00032, is extraordinarily high;\nit is larger than those in other storm classes by more than\n9 keV\/cm\u00032. The second largest entropy (15.93 keV\/cm\u00032)\nand the lowest value of the entropy peaks (13.27 keV\/cm\u00032)\nare also found during moderate storms at solar minimum\nand during intense storms at solar maximum, respectively.\n[34] As listed in Table 1, intense storms (moderate\nstorms) at solar minimum again have the lowest (the second\nlowest) average anisotropy, 0.64 (0.73), among the four\nstorm categories. As shown in Figures 3\u20136, the most\nremarkable feature of temperature anisotropy is that its\ndecrease regions spread across the entire nightside, and it\nthen does not show distinct dawn-dusk asymmetry like other\nparameters. In the late recovery phase during both intense\nstorms and moderate storms at solar minimum, temperature\nanisotropy decreases a second time in the premidnight\nsector. More data are necessary to verify whether this is a\ntypical feature during solar minimum storms.\n5. Discussion\n[35] In this paper, using the superposed epoch technique\nas in the companion study of [Zhang et al., 2006], we have\nexamined and compared the average behaviors of the hot-\nion properties (fluxes, moments, and their derivatives) at\ngeosynchronous orbit during intense storms and moderate\nstorms at solar maximum and at solar minimum of Solar\nCycle 23. After the large amounts of the MPA data are\naveraged and then color coded on the LT-UT maps,\nthe timing and asymmetry\/symmetry of intensifications in\nthe quantity of each hot-ion parameter are readily apparent.\nThe similarities and differences of those average patterns\namong the four storm categories have important implica-\ntions for the purpose of understanding the storm-time ring\ncurrent sources. Moreover, the statistical results from the\nMPA data analysis can be applied to obtain better simula-\ntion results because the geosynchronous-orbit plasmas are\noften used as an outer boundary for modeling the inner\nmagnetosphere, especially the storm-time ring current.\n[36] In order to include as many storm events as possible\nin our study, we define solar maximum and solar minimum\nof Solar Cycle 23 exactly the same way as in the companion\nwork by Zhang et al. [2006]. That is, solar minimum\n(maximum) is the time period of 3 years approximately\ncentered on the trough (crest) of the monthly smoothed\nsunspot numbers in Solar Cycle 23. Therefore the usual\nsolar minimum (maximum) [e.g., Vennerstroem, 2001] and\na short period of the late (early) declining phase and the\nearly (late) rising phase of the solar cycle have been chosen\nas the duration of solar minimum (maximum) in this paper.\nHowever, even with the loose definition of solar minimum,\nthe superposed LT-UT maps of intense storms at solar\nminimum are produced with only 10 events. In order to\ntest the statistical significance, we conducted the Student\u2019s\nt-test on the means in each LT-UT bin among the four storm\ncategories. Since there are fewer geosynchronous LANL\nsatellites in earlier years (e.g., at solar minimum), the\nStudent\u2019s t-test is a good alternative to ensure that compar-\nisons among the results are significant, even with a rela-\ntively small number of storms.\n5.1. Access to Geosynchronous Orbit and Fluxes\n[37] During storms, responding to the strong southward\nIMF and other accompanying disturbances in upstream\nsolar wind plasma and IMF as presented by Zhang et al.\n[2006], the plasma sheet can access geosynchronous orbit\nunder the enhanced large-scale convection electric field\n[Zhang et al., 2001; Korth et al., 1999; Korth and Thomsen,\n2001]. As a result, more energetic and denser particles in the\nplasma sheet become the typical plasma populations in part\nof the geosynchronous orbit in the main phase and in the\nearly recovery phase of storms, which are detected by the\nMPA instruments. In other words, those energized ions and\nelectrons from the plasma sheet can be transported across\ngeosynchronous orbit to closer to the Earth (typically, L =\n3\u20136). This deep plasma penetration is consistent with the\nstorm-time enhancement of NOAA\/POES Hemispheric\nPower and the intensity of the ring current that is gauged\nby the average Dst* and Kp as presented by Zhang et al.\n[2006]. The typical properties of low-energy ions and\nelectrons at geosynchronous orbit were investigated in\nseveral previous studies [e.g., Korth et al., 1999; Denton\net al., 2005, 2006]. The LT and UT dependence of the hot-\nion properties at geosynchronous orbit is the focus of this\npresent paper.\n[38] Unlike cold ions and electrons, hot ions have very\ncomplex drift paths in the inner magnetosphere, which are\ndependent on levels of geomagnetic activity and their\nmagnetic moments (the first adiabatic invariant)\nm \u00bc\n1\n2\nmv2?\nB\n;\nwhere mv?\n2 \/2 is the kinetic energy perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field B, and B is the magnitude of B. Using a\nsimple Alfve\u00b4n layer model, Korth et al. [1999] computed\nthe position of the separatrix between open and closed ion\ndrift paths as a function of energy, local time, and level of\ngeomagnetic activity. At quiet times (Dst* \n \u000350 nT),\ngeosynchronous orbit is located in the region of closed drift\npaths for ions at energies greater than \u000130 keV. In this case,\nA07206 ZHANG ET AL.: HOT-ION PROPERTIES DURING STORMS\n12 of 16\nA07206\nthe stagnation point is on the dawnside. At lower ion\nenergies, the corresponding separatrix first moves closer to\nthe Earth, then evolves into two sets with one being a closed\nbanana orbit, and lastly reverses its configuration with the\nstagnation point flipping to the duskside [Korth et al., 1999,\nFigure 1]. In other words, under low geomagnetic activity,\nvery hot ions in the plasma sheet do not have access to\ngeosynchronous orbit; for intermediately hot ions, the\nplasma sheet can have access to geosynchronous orbit in\nthe premidnight sector and the afternoon sector; for lower-\nenergy ions, the plasma sheet begins to access geosynchro-\nnous orbit from the other side, i.e., from the postmidnight\nsector and the morning sector. Therefore as shown on the\nflux LT-UT maps, low flux rates at \u000130, \u000117, and \u00018 keV\nare found in the morning sector but those at \u00011 keV are in\nthe afternoon sector. During storms, for hot ions in each\nchannel, the separatrix goes even closer to the Earth than\nthat of same-energy ions at quiet times and the banana orbit\nappears in the drift paths of lower-energy ions. Thus\n\u000130 keV ions in the plasma sheet can be injected inside of\ngeosynchronous orbit in the main phase to make the flux\nrates at \u000130 keV enhanced across nearly the entire\nnightside. Similarly, the theoretical locations of the\nseparatrix in other channels can be used to explain the\ndawnside shift of the flux enhancements at the energy from\n\u000117 keV, \u00018 keV, to \u00011 keV. Ebihara and Fok [2004] also\nstudied the postmidnight storm-time enhancement of tens-\nof-keV proton fluxes from the IMAGE satellite, but they did\nnot consider the effects of the energy dependence of proton\ndrift paths on the flux LT distributions.\n[39] Note that the Alfve\u00b4n layer model is highly simplified.\nThe realistic ion injections into the inner magnetosphere\npassing geosynchronous orbit are much more complicated.\nSeveral other factors can affect the LT and UT distributions\nof hot-ion flux rates in geosynchronous orbit. First of all,\nloss processes such as charge exchange, atmospheric losses,\nwave-particle interactions, and Coulomb collisions [e.g.,\nKistler et al., 1989; Fok et al., 1991; Jordanova et al.,\n1996; Kozyra et al., 1998a] play an important role in\ncausing the dawn-dusk asymmetry of the flux LT distribu-\ntions because plasma sheet ions take drift paths with\ndifferent lengths to arrive at dawn and at dusk. Those ions\nwith longer and more circuitous routes suffer more losses\nand hence have lower flux rates [Korth et al., 1999]. This\nmay be a reason for why in the earlier recovery phase of\neach type of storm the flux rates in every channel are almost\nalways low in the premidnight sector. The hot-ions presum-\nably have experienced losses before they are injected from\nthe magnetotail and reach the premidnight sector. Second,\nparticles closer to the stagnation point have slower flow\nspeeds; particles are expected to stagnate at the stagnation\npoint. Hot-ion fluxes near the stagnation point can be\nenhanced during storms. Third, at most times, there is a\npartial ring current during the storm main phase. Additional\ncharging, positively at dusk and negatively at dawn, occurs\non the nightside. The resulting dusk-dawn polarization\nelectric field shields the near-Earth region from the dawn-\ndusk convection electric field and opposes the convection in\nthe inner magnetosphere. Overshielding (undershielding)\noccurs when the driving convection electric field is suddenly\nreduced (increased), due to the sudden changes in southward\nIMF magnitude or sign [e.g., Spiro et al., 1988; Fejer and\nScherliess, 1997; Goldstein et al., 2003]. The flux LT\nasymmetry can result from these shielding phenomena.\nHowever, further investigations are needed to examine the\ndetailed physical processes and to see which of these\nmechanisms dominates. Last, the plasma transport via the\nlow-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) into the magnetosphere\nmay also have effects on the dawn-dusk asymmetry in the\nhot-ion fluxes. The solar wind plasma, first trapped in the\nmagnetosheath, can enter the plasma sheet through both\nthe high-latitude lobes and the LLBL. It has been found that\nthe portion of plasma entering via the LLBL is both dense\nand cold [e.g., Eastman et al., 1976; Fujimoto et al., 1996,\n1998a, 1998b]. These cold, dense ions, which have the\nplasma characteristics of the magnetosheath, are found to\nbe present close to the dawnside in the morning sector\naround Dst*min on the density and temperature LT-UT maps\nin each of the four storm categories.\n5.2. Bulk Properties\n[40] Hot-ion density has been calculated according to\nmeasured fluxes in 14 channels with an energy range from\n\u00010.1 to \u000145 keV. Because the ion drift trajectories are\nenergy dependent, as found in our statistical results, the\nlocations of the flux enhancement regions at different levels\nof energies are different from each other. When energies\nbecome lower, those enhancement regions shift from the\nentire nightside to dawnside and show a distinct dawn-dusk\nasymmetry. Moreover, higher flux peak values are found in\nthe lower-energy ions. As a result, the calculated density is\ncontributed more from the portions of ions with lower\nenergies. During storms, the dawn-dusk asymmetry in\ndensity is determined by (and thus similar to) that of the\nlower-energy ion fluxes. Considering the complexity, espe-\ncially the energy dependence, of ion drifts in the inner\nmagnetosphere, it would have limitations in investigating\nonly the ion bulk properties and ignoring the energy\ndependence of the ion drift paths to understand the devel-\nopment of the ring current.\n[41] The locations of the regions with high density, low\ntemperature, and low entropy indicate that the delivery of\nfresh (cold and dense) ions into the inner magnetosphere\nhas an obvious LT asymmetry. As discussed above, 0300\u2013\n1100 LT on the dawnside is the region where the cold and\ndense ions are transported from the solar wind through\nthe magnetosheath and LLBL into geosynchronous orbit.\nBecause collisions are frequent on the nightside and there is\nno preferred direction, hot ions are isotropic on the entire\nnightside during storms and do not show a clear dawn-dusk\nasymmetry. In other words, on the nightside, the thermal\nspeed of hot ions along the magnetic field direction is not\ndifferent from that perpendicular to the magnetic field\ndirection. However, on the dayside, especially in the morn-\ning sector, the perpendicular speed of hot ions can be higher\nthan the parallel one.\n[42] The LT asymmetries in fluxes, density, temperature,\nentropy, and temperature anisotropy provide a better under-\nstanding of the geosynchronous plasma environment during\nstorm times. Those asymmetries are expected to have\nimportant effects on the development of the storm-time ring\ncurrent and help make improvements to the simulations of\nthe inner magnetosphere by providing a more comprehen-\nsive outer boundary. It is also of interest to investigate how\nA07206 ZHANG ET AL.: HOT-ION PROPERTIES DURING STORMS\n13 of 16\nA07206\nthe effects of the LT asymmetries on the ring current depend\non different solar wind conditions.\n5.3. Solar Cycle Dependence\n[43] Borovsky et al. [1998a] found that the properties of\nthe plasma sheet are highly correlated with the properties of\nthe solar wind. Therefore hot-ion properties at geosynchro-\nnous orbit during storms show dependence on the solar\ncycle. The plasma sheet density and the solar wind density\ncorrelate to each other with a correlation coefficient as high\nas 0.67 [Borovsky et al., 1998a]. In addition, the statistical\ncompanion study by Zhang et al. [2006] shows that solar\nwind density in the main phase of intense storms at solar\nminimum is on average the highest in the four storm\ncategories. This is consistent with the fact that the highest\nplasma sheet density is found in intense storms at solar\nminimum, even though the broadest density enhancement\nregion is shown on the LT-UT map of intense storms at solar\nmaximum.\n[44] In the magnetosphere, the primary energy transfer\nprocess is mechanical energy from the solar wind flows\nbeing converted into magnetic energy and stored in the\nmagnetotail. The magnetic energy is then converted into\nmostly thermal mechanical energy in the plasma sheet,\nauroral particles, ring current, and Joule heating in the\nionosphere [Gonzalez et al., 1994]. Borovsky et al.\n[1998a] found that the temperature of the nightside plasma\nsheet is correlated with the speed of the solar wind with a\nlinear correlation coefficient as high as 0.56. At\nsolar maximum, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), of which\none-third to one-half are magnetic clouds (MCs), play\nan overriding role in driving geomagnetic storms [e.g.,\nTsurutani and Gonzalez, 1997; Gonzalez et al., 1999; Zhang\net al., 2004]. However, at solar minimum, the dominating\ngeoeffective solar wind structures are corotating interaction\nregions (CIRs) [e.g., Tsurutani and Gonzalez, 1997;\nGonzalez et al., 1999], associated with very high-speed\nstreams. High-speed solar wind flows, originating from\nopen solar magnetic field lines at solar minimum, may be\none of the reasons for the higher ion temperature in the\nafternoon sector and on the nightside at geosynchronous\norbit during solar minimum storms than during solar max-\nimum storms. However, extremely fast solar winds are\nmostly observed in the ejecta (CMEs or MCs); moreover,\nit is found in the companion study by Zhang et al. [2006]\nthat solar wind flows in the 3-day epoch time of intense\nstorms at solar minimum are on average the slowest among\nthe four storm categories. One possibility for this difference\nis that Zhang et al. [2006] did not choose the zero epoch at\nCIR interfaces, and thus average speeds at several time\npoints were calculated from both high-speed flows and low-\nspeed flows. Other than this one, we have no other reason-\nable explanations for the inconsistency in the two recent\nstudies. Further investigation is needed to figure out why\nhot-ion temperature and entropy are on average not clearly\nenhanced during solar maximum storms.\n6. Summary\n[45] We summarize our statistical survey of the hot-ion\nproperties at geosynchronous orbit during the 164 storms in\nthe four categories as follows:\n[46] 1. Fluxes (at \u000130, \u000117, \u00018, and \u00011 keV), density,\ntemperature, entropy, and temperature anisotropy vary with\nboth local time (LT) and universal time (UT). In the main\nphase and the early recovery phase during storms, respond-\ning to the upstream geoeffective IMF and solar wind\nparameters, all hot-ion parameters are highly disturbed\naround Dst*min; they display obvious increase or decrease\nregions and show distinct peaks or minima. In addition, the\nlocations of these increase or decrease patterns do not\nchange much with levels of geomagnetic activity and solar\nactivity.\n[47] 2. Fluxes at \u000130 keVare enhanced during almost the\nentire nightside in the main phase; as the energy is reduced\nto \u000117, \u00018, and to \u00011 keV, the enhancement begins to shift\nclose to dawn and also extend into the early recovery phase.\nFurthermore, the lower the channel energy, the higher the\nflux peak values. The regions with low fluxes also change\nfrom the morning sector at higher energies to the afternoon\nsector at \u00011 keV.\n[48] 3. Similar to their uncommon superposed solar wind\ndriver [Zhang et al., 2006], intense storms at solar minimum\nalways have the highest (lowest) average peak value (min-\nimum) in each hot-ion parameter among the four storm\ncategories, even though their average ring current is not the\nmost intensified; in this storm category, density and fluxes\nat \u000130, \u000117, and \u00018 keV exhibit another peak near dusk in\nthe middle of the main phase.\n[49] 4. During each type of storm, density has a clear\nasymmetric LT distribution around Dst*min; it peaks in a\nregion of 0900 LT\u2013midnight and 12 UT hours before and\nafter Dst*min and falls off close to noon. During moderate\nstorms at solar minimum, density has the lowest peak value\nand is least enhanced in the whole 3-day epoch time among\nthe four storm categories, which is consistent with the fact\nthat the average Dst*min in this storm category is the lowest.\n[50] 5. From 0300 LT through dawn to 1100 LT, temper-\nature and entropy are generally lower than those at other\nlocal times during nearly the entire 3-day epoch time. Very\nlow temperature and entropy are found in a region of 0700\u2013\n1000 LT and \u00b14-hour epoch time centered at Dst*min.\nBecause high-speed solar winds dominate at solar mini-\nmum, in their enhanced regions (nightside and afternoon\nsector), both temperature and entropy during solar minimum\nstorms are usually higher than those during solar maximum\nstorms; there is actually no clear temperature and entropy\nenhancement during solar maximum storms.\n[51] 6. During storms, hot ions are isotropic on the\nnightside but anisotropic (Tper\/Tpar > 1) close to noon. In\nthe late recovery phase during solar minimum storms,\ntemperature anisotropy decreases a second time in the\npremidnight sector.\n[52] 7. In the late recovery phase in every storm category,\nalong with IMF Bs becoming weaker and turning northward,\nalmost all enhanced or decreased hot-ion parameters recover\nto prestorm levels.\n[53] Acknowledgments.
