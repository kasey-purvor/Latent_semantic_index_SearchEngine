Figure 1 schematically illus-\ntrates the physics behind the development of a\nsmall-scale convective instability from a thermal\nboundary layer. Oceanic lithosphere on top of a hot\n(almost isothermal) upper mantle represents a\ngravitationally unstable situation. The top part of\nthe lithosphere is very strong, which does not allow\nsignificant internal deformation. Only material at\nthe bottom of the lithosphere with a viscosity up to\n\u0001exp(2.24) \u000210 times that of the underlying\nmantle [Davaille and Jaupart, 1994] is weak\nenough to participate in a convective instability.\nAs oceanic lithosphere cools and grows thicker,\nthis weaker bottom layer of the lithosphere grows\nproportionally (the constant viscosity ratio ht\/hb\nand therefore also the temperature ratio Tt\/Tb\nbetween top and bottom of the SSC layer implies\na constant ratio of yt\/2\nffiffiffiffi\nkt\np\nover yb\/2\nffiffiffiffi\nkt\np\n, and\ntherefore yt\/yb is constant). When the local Ray-\nleigh number of this layer exceeds the critical\nRayleigh number, (small-scale) convection will\nstart [Howard, 1964; Davaille and Jaupart, 1994;\nTurcotte and Schubert, 2002; Dumoulin et al.,\n2005]. When a plate motion and background\nshearing are present, convection rolls aligning with\nthe plate motions are gravitationally most unstable\nand will be the preferred orientation of SSC\n[Richter, 1973; Marquart, 2001; van Hunen et\nal., 2003].\n[4] Small-scale convection was first suggested as\na process to explain the deviation of topography and\nheat flow of old oceanic seafloor from the theoret-\nical purely conductive halfspace cooling predictions\n[Parsons and McKenzie, 1978; Nagihara et al.,\n1996]. Gravity lineations in the Pacific were later\nattributed to the same process [Haxby and Weissel,\n1986; Buck and Parmentier, 1986; Marquart,\n2001]. Seismic tomographic observations suggest\nthe presence of small-scale variations of seismic\nvelocities below the old Pacific [Katzman et al.,\n1998], and present evidence for a \u2018\u2018reheating phase\u2019\u2019\nof the Pacific lithosphere between 70 and 100 Ma\n[Ritzwoller et al., 2004]. It has furthermore been\nsuggested that SSC is a mechanism to create\nintraplate volcanism that cannot be attributed to\nhot spot volcanism [Haxby and Weissel, 1986;\nDoin and Fleitout, 1996; Raddick et al., 2002].\nGravity lineations, seismic tomography patterns,\nand volcanic alignments all occur in elongated\nstructure that, to some extend, align with the\npresent-day Pacific plate motion. If these processes\nare indeed the result of SSC, then orientation\nrelative to the plate motion direction should tell\nus something about the response of SSC to changes\nin plate motions.\n[5] The bend in the Hawaii-Emperor chain of\nseamounts (HEB) is dated at 43\u201347 Ma. It forms\nthe classical example of a sudden change in the\nrelative motion between the Pacific lithosphere and\nthe underlying Hawaiian mantle plume [Morgan,\n1971]. Richter [1973] and Richter and Parsons\n[1975] showed the dominance of longitudinal con-\nvection rolls of mantle flow below a lithosphere that\nmoves with respect to the deeper mantle as a result\nof shearing between the lithosphere and the deeper\nmantle. On the basis of laboratory studies of iso-\nviscous fluid flow they suggested that within 20\u2013\n50 Ma rolls would align with the plate motion if the\nplate moves with 10 cm\/yr [Richter and Parsons,\n1975]. This implies that by now, 43\u201347 Ma after\nFigure 1. Illustration of SSC roll formation. Only the\nbottom part of the lithosphere with a viscosity less than\n10 times the underlying mantle will eventually partici-\npate in convection.

The importance of these results\nlies in the guidance of any search for observational\nevidence for SSC structures: it tells us what kind of\nstructures we can expect.\n[6] In this study, we further elaborate on this pio-\nneering work. In particular, we are interested in the\nrole ofmore sophisticated Earth-like rheology on the\ndevelopment and realignment of SSC roll structures\nwith a changing plate motion. This issue was not\naddresses in the early work of Richter, but is likely to\nplay a dominant role, because the appearance of SSC\nin itself is dominated by rheological parameters. We\nwill address the following questions. Do preexisting\nSSC rolls influence the development of newly ori-\nented rolls after a change in plate motion direction?\nWhat are the influences of rheological parameters\n(diffusion vs. dislocation creep, activation energy,\nrheological layering, effective mantle viscosity) on\nthe style and timescale of the realignment of the roll\nstructureswith the newplatemotion direction?What\nare the possible observations to further constrain our\nmodel results? The paper is organized as follows.\nAfter presenting the governing equations and mod-\neling techniques, we discuss the modeling results on\nthe basis of a few key results. Next, we will present a\nmethod to quantify the dominant roll structure\nthrough time. This quantification of the results\nenables us to draw some general conclusions.\nFinally we discuss the implications and observa-\ntions of the results.\n2. Methods, Model Description, and\nTechniques\n[7] Calculations are performed with a three-dimen-\nsional (3-D) finite element code Citcom [Moresi\nand Gurnis, 1996; Zhong et al., 2000], extended\nfor nonlinear (stress dependent) rheology [van\nHunen et al., 2005]. Fluid flow is incompressible,\nhas infinite Prandtl number, adopts the Boussinesq\napproximations [e.g., Schubert et al., 2001], and is\ngoverned by the following nondimensional equa-\ntions [McKenzie et al., 1974]:\nr \u0005 u \u00bc 0; \u00f01\u00de\n\trP \u00fer \u0005 h ru\u00ferTu\u0002 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\u00fe RaTez \u00bc 0; \u00f02\u00de\n@T\n@t\n\u00fe u \u0005 rT \u00bc r2T : \u00f03\u00de\nThese equations describe the conservation of mass,\nmomentum and thermal energy, respectively.\nSymbols are described in Table 1, and in our\n(bottom-heated) experiments the Rayleigh number\nRa is defined in the usual way:\nRa \u00bc ar0gDTh\n3\nkh0\n: \u00f04\u00de\nEquations (1) to (3) are nondimensionalized in the\nfollowing way: x* = x0h, t* = t0 h2\/k, h* = h0 h0, and\nT* = T0 D T. The primes are dropped in equations\n(1) to (3) and the remainder of the paper for clarity.\n[8] A general nonlinear rheology is implemented:\n_\u0004 \u00bc Asn exp \tE*=RTabs\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f05\u00de\nwhich is benchmarked against results from\nChristensen [1984]. This enables us to use both\ndiffusion creep (with n = 1) and dislocation creep\n(for which we took n = 3.5 [Karato and Wu, 1993]).\nThe prefactor A is chosen such that the effective\nviscosity heff = s\/ _\u0004 = h0 at mantle temperature (i.e.,\nnondimensional temperature T = 1) and, in the\nstrain-rate dependent viscosity case n > 1, under\nstress\/strain rate conditions that result from the\nimposed velocity at the inflow boundary. We\nconstrain heff (and therefore also A) with SSC onset\ntimes rather than with laboratory measurements,\nbecause the effective mantle viscosity is not very\naccurately known due to the uncertainties in, e.g.,\nthe amount of hydration.\n[9] Calculations are performed in a rectangular box\nof 14,000 by 2000 or 4000 km wide and 670 km\ndeep, representing a part of the western Pacific\noceanic upper mantle. All calculations have a T =\n1350\u0006C and no-slip conditions as bottom thermal\nand flow boundary conditions. At the surface, T =\n0\u0006C and a plate motion of 8.6 cm\/yr is prescribed\nwith respect to the bottom boundary in the direc-\ntion of increasing x coordinate. The combination of\nprescribed plate motion and a no-slip bottom\nboundary condition produces the shear that is\nresponsible for the alignment of convective rolls\nwith the plate velocity. The front and back side\nboundaries (at minimum and maximum y coordi-\nnate, respectively) have symmetry boundary con-\nditions for both the momentum and energy\nequations (v = sxy = syz = dT\/dy = 0). Such\nboundary conditions are common for convection\nsimulations, and although in this specific case of\noblique convection rolls these boundary conditions\nare not ideal, they probably still are the least\nrestrictive ones to the flow. By making the calcu-\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 van hunen and zhong: mantle convective structure 10.1029\/2005GC001209\n3 of 14\nlations in the restart phase 4000 km wide, we\nensure little effect of the boundary conditions on\nthe interior of the box. The inflow temperature\nfield corresponds to either a half-space cooling\nmodel for 5 Ma old lithosphere (for the \u2018\u2018initial\nphase\u2019\u2019 described below) or a numerically interpo-\nlated field from this \u2018\u2018initial phase\u2019\u2019 (for the \u2018\u2018restart\nphase\u2019\u2019, also described below). At in- and outflow\nboundaries, a horizontal flow-through velocity\nboundary condition is imposed to simulate large-\nscale Couette-type flow resulting from plate mo-\ntion relative to the deep mantle: the velocity field is\nnormal to the inflow boundary (no components in y\nand z direction) and the shear between the top and\nbottom of the box is distributed such that the\nhorizontal shear stress sxz = _\u0004xzheff is constant for\neach column of elements on the inflow boundary:\nvx(z) = vpl -\nR\nz0 = 0\nz _\u0004xz(z\n0)dz0. This flow condition is\ncopied onto the opposite boundary as the outflow\nboundary condition. This outflow boundary is put\nfar away of the region of interest, such that the\ninfluence on the flow pattern in the box\u2019s interior is\nnegligibly small.\n[10] All results share the same three-phase model-\ning procedure: (1) an \u2018\u2018initial\u2019\u2019 flow phase for given\nplate motion direction is followed by (2) a sudden\nevent of rotation of the plate motion direction, after\nwhich (3) a second \u2018\u2018restart\u2019\u2019 phase is started.\nFigure 2 illustrates this procedure using the model\nresults of model Case 1 (which is described in\ndetail in Table 2).\n[11] 1. In the initial phase, time integration of the\nflow and temperature distribution inside the model\ndomain is performed until a statistically steady\nstate thermal solution is obtained.\n[12] 2. Second, the temperature solution is mir-\nrored several times in the y direction, i.e., the\ndirection perpendicular to the plate motion direc-\ntion. In this way a solution in a wider domain is\nobtained, from which a box with a 60 degree\nTable 1.

This rotation repre-\nsents a sudden change in the plate motion direction\nwith respect to the deep mantle or hot spot refer-\nence frame, and can be related to the kink in the\nHawaii-Emperor seamount chain.\n[13] 3. During the restart phase, a new calculation\nis started from this rotated box to examine the\neffect of this sudden change in plate motion direc-\ntion on the development convective structure.\n[14] Such three phase procedure is equivalent to\nproducing a single model calculation in which the\nplate motion is suddenly changed, but this ap-\nproach is computationally more efficient and tech-\nnically more feasible. During the restart phase, the\ninflow temperature distribution effectively repre-\nsents a MOR oblique to the spreading velocity,\nsuch as modeled by Morency et al.

Technically, the differences between the\ninitial and the restart phases are the numerical\nresolution, the initial and inflow boundary condi-\ntions for the temperature field, and the lateral size\nof the box in plate-motion-perpendicular direction.\nInitial phase calculations are performed in a\n2000 km wide box, which is wide enough to avoid\nany side boundary effects [van Hunen et al., 2005],\nand each calculation is performed with 256 \f 64 \f\n24 elements. For the restart phase, a 4000 km wide\nbox is used to ensure that also in this case, where\nstructures oblique to the side walls are more\ndominant, the box is wide enough. In that case,\nthe numerical resolution in x direction is taken\nequal to that in y direction to accurately resolve\nroll structures oblique to the plate motion, and\nthose calculations are thus performed with 512 \f\n128 \f 24 elements. We apply vertical mesh re-\nfinement in the top half of the box to increase the\nresolution there. One calculation with small length\nscales for thermal structure (Case 2, Table 2) was\nrecalculated with 1.5 times more elements in each\nhorizontal direction to check for sufficient spatial\nresolution.\n[15] The applied version of Citcom uses a parallel\nfull-multigrid iterative solver [Moresi and Solomatov,\n1995;Moresi and Gurnis, 1996; Zhong et al., 2000]\nfor the Stokes equation (equations (1) and (2)), and\na SUPG explicit solver [Brooks and Hughes, 1982]\nto obtain the temperature field. Parallel calculation\nis performed using domain-decomposition with\nMPI [Zhong et al., 2000].\n[16] Apart from visual inspection, the SSC onset\ntime and dominant convective roll structure orien-\ntation can be obtained more quantitatively and\nobjectively. Onset time of SSC is taken as the\nlithospheric age where the thermal field for the\nfirst time deviates more than 1% from the cooling\nhalfspace solution [Davaille and Jaupart, 1994]. In\nsome cases, minor fluctuations in the temperature\nfield can be observed prior to this onset time. For\nthe roll structure orientation, we use a method\nFigure 2. Modeling technique to simulate a sudden\nchange in the plate motion direction, illustrated with a\nhorizontal cross section at 150 km depth of the\ntemperature field for Case 1. (a) An initial calculation\nis performed until thermal statistical steady state\nsolution is obtained. (b) Mirroring the temperature field\nseveral times in the y direction provides a wide solution.\nA box of 14000 \f 4000 km with b = 60\u0006 with the x axis\nis cut out. (c) The resulting temperature field is used as\ninitial and boundary conditions in a restart calculation.\nThe red box indicates the surface area below which the\ndominant roll structure is quantified. Different initial\nlocations for this rectangle are used, and the rectangle\nmoves along with the lithospheric plate.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 van hunen and zhong: mantle convective structure 10.1029\/2005GC001209\n5 of 14\ndescribed as the multi-scale principal components\nanalysis of local orientation [Feng and Milanfar,\n2002; Rieger and van Vliet, 2003]. It uses the\nconcept that the roll orientation is perpendicular\nto the direction of the largest average horizontal\nthermal gradient. This means that the orientation of\nthe dominant roll structures is represented by the\neigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigen-\nvalue of the gradient structure tensor\nC \u00bc rTrTt ; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere the bar represents the average over a local\nvolume. Here, this local volume is defined as the\nvolume of the top 200 km below an approximately\nsquare surface area of 2400\f 2400 km, as indicated\nby the red area in the cross section in Figure 2c. This\nsurface area is chosen rather arbitrarily, but it is large\nenough to ensure observing the \u2018\u2018global\u2019\u2019 behavior\nrather than that of an individual SSC roll, but small\nenough to avoid mixing lithosphere of completely\ndifferent ages. This region moves along with the\nlithospheric plate, and different starting positions\nwere examined.\n[17] The presented model setup is chosen such that\nsublithospheric SSC can be studied efficiently.\nHowever, a second, much smaller thermal bound-\nary layer develops at the bottom of the model, from\nwhich instabilities in the form of small hot plumes\nmay arise, as indicated in a cross section of the\nthermal field in a previous paper [van Hunen et al.,\n2005]. These plumes do not seem to influence the\nplanform an vigor of SSC significantly.\n3.

Thermal field at 150 km depth to indicate\nthe development of roll structure in the default case\n(Case 1, see Table 2). (a) Initial situation at time of\nrestart (t = 0). (b and c) After 20 and 40 Ma, the old roll\nstructure is still dominating. (d and e) Only after 60 Ma,\nnew roll structure clearly starts to overprint the old one,\nwhich seems completed at 80 Ma. A depiction of this\nprocess is available as Animation 1.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 van hunen and zhong: mantle convective structure 10.1029\/2005GC001209\n6 of 14\nfor this model (Case 1) and other models. In this\nfirst case, a Newtonian rheology (n = 1) with rather\nlow activation energy E* = 120 kJ\/mol, a plate\nmotion of 8.6 cm\/yr, Ra = 1.2 \f 107, and a\nrheological layering at 400 km depth with a 50-\nfold jump in the effective viscosity were used. Such\nlow activation energy mimics the effect of disloca-\ntion creep with a Newtonian fluid [Christensen,\n1984]. The 50-fold jump in viscosity at 400 km\ndepth is motivated by Hager and Richards [1989]\nresults from geoid constraints, and results in almost\ncomplete concentration of the shear induced by\nplate motion in the upper 400 km, and the actual\nsize of the viscosity jump has little influence in this\ncase. These parameter settings give small-scale\nconvection with an onset time of approximately\n70 Ma, and its reheating effects were shown to fit\nseismic surface wave observations [van Hunen et\nal., 2005]. After the rotation event, described\nabove, Figure 3a shows a horizontal cross section\nat the beginning of the restart phase at 150 km depth\n(where for this calculation SSC rolls are most\npronounced). It clearly illustrates the orientation\nof the \u2018\u2018old\u2019\u2019 roll structures relative to the new\norientation of the box and the plate motion direc-\ntion. Figures 3b, 3c, 3d, and 3e show the resulting\nSSC roll pattern development after 20, 40, 60 and\n80 Ma, respectively, of time integration with a left-\nto-right plate motion direction (i.e., in the direction\nof increasing x coordinate). The vertical solid line in\nthose plots indicates the divide between the \u2018\u2018old\u2019\u2019\npart (the part which previously experienced the old\nplate motion direction), and the \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 lithosphere\n(that was flowing into the model domain only after\nthe rotation in plate motion direction had occurred).\nSince no \u2018\u2018memory\u2019\u2019 of old roll structures exists in\nthe new part, it is not surprising that convective\nrolls align with the new plate motion there, similar\nto the initial-phase roll structures before the change\nin plate motion direction. Unlike before the rotation\nphase, the line where initial SSC occurs (or \u2018\u2018SSC\nfront\u2019\u2019) is not perpendicular to the plate motion\nanymore after rotation, and a thermal gradient\nremains in the plate-motion-perpendicular direc-\ntion. This is because the lithospheric age at the\ninflow boundary, inherited from the rotated initial\ncalculation, is kept as the thermal boundary condi-\ntion throughout the whole restart calculation. In the\nold part, we see that after 20 Ma the old structure is\nstill clearly present, although thermal gradients\nhave smoothed somewhat. After 40 Ma, roll struc-\ntures below the oldest part of the plate show a\nrealignment, and rolls parallel to the plate motion\nstart to appear. After 60 Ma, most old rolls have\ndisappeared and have been replaced by rolls parallel\nto the plate motion, and after 80 Ma roll alignment\nwith the new plate motion seems complete. From\nthis we can conclude that for this case, roll realign-\nment with the plate motion occurs within 60 to\n80 Ma Animations 1.\n[19] Case 2 shows the same type of calculation\nwith a different rheology: n = 3.5, E* = 360 kJ\/mol,\nand Ra = 2.4 \f 107. Results are shown in Figure\n4. As with Case 1, also this parameter combina-\ntion gives small-scale convection below litho-\nsphere of \u000170 Ma, and its lithospheric reheating\neffect fits the seismic observations [van Hunen et\nal., 2005]. After the rotation event, a temperature\nfield is obtained again which has roll structures\noblique to the new plate motion direction. A cross\nsection at 120 km depth of this field is shown in\nFigure 4a. Roll-structures are somewhat finer (i.e.,\non a smaller scale), but otherwise comparable to\nFigure 4. (a\u2013d) As Figure 3, but for Case 2: n = 3.5,\nE* = 360 kJ\/mol. Cross sections are taken at a depth of\n120 km. (b) Already after 20 Ma, old structures have\nbeen significantly overprinted. (c and d) After 40 Ma,\nthe dominant angle b between the roll structures and the\nplate motion direction remains constant at about 10\u2013\n20\u0006. A depiction of this process is available as\nAnimation 2.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 van hunen and zhong: mantle convective structure 10.1029\/2005GC001209\n7 of 14\nthe ones in Figure 3. After starting the restart\nphase, old structures are quickly erased: after\nalready 20\u201330 Ma, the old plate motion direction\ncannot be easily recognized anymore. Later, a\nsmall angle between the rolls and the plate motion\ndirection remains, which is probably due to the age\nvariation of the plate in y direction. For these\nrheological settings, realignment of the rolls with\nthe plate motion is completed in about 20\u201330 Ma:\nmuch faster than for the Newtonian case-1 calcu-\nlation. After 60 Ma the front of the SSC region is\nnot as strongly correlated to the age of the plate as\nin Case 1: in general, onset age of SSC in case of\nnonlinear rheology fluctuates significantly, due to\ncomplicated feedback between (large- and small-\nscale) shearing, thermal erosion, and the effective\nviscosity Animation 2.\n[20] Case 3 is illustrated in Figure 5. In this case,\nwe again adopted the Newtonian rheology settings\nfrom case 1, but removed the rheological boundary\nat 400 km depth. In Case 1 the shearing between\nthe plate motion and the deeper mantle was mainly\nconfined to the upper mantle above 400 km depth,\nas the mantle below is much stiffer and shears\nmuch less. Removing the rheologically strong layer\nbelow 400 km depth spreads out the shearing\nbetween the moving plate and the deep mantle\nover a larger depth range, and thus reduces the\nshear stress. Since this shearing is responsible for\nthe alignment of SSC rolls with the plate motion,\nwe expect this reduced shearing to lead to reduced\nrealignment. Figure 5 shows that this is indeed the\ncase. Even after 60 Ma, the old roll structures can\nstill be recognized. Even where old roll structure is\noverprinted, a clear pattern of new rolls aligning\nwith the plate motion is not visible. Instead,\nisolated dots in Figures 5c\u20135e indicate the pres-\nence of plume like downwellings without a clear\norientation. Note that simultaneously below the\n\u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 plate roll structures are forming: this clearly\nindicates that the presence of old structure severely\nhampers the formation of new structure. Figure 5\nshows that shearing plays a dominant role in the\nalignment of rolls with plate motion Animation 3.\n[21] We performed several more calculations, and\nall model parameters are given in Table 2. We\nquantified the dominant orientation of the roll\nstructure in all models using the eigenvectors from\nthe average thermal gradient structure tensor in a\nlocal area. Figure 6 shows the resulting dominant\nrealignment angle b for each calculation inside the\nlocal area as a function of elapsed model time\nsince the plate motion rotation. The left edge of\nthe calculation rectangle (shown in Figure 2c)\nwas initially positioned at 2000 km (Figure 6a),\n4000 km (Figure 6b), or 6000 km (Figure 6c) from\nthe inflow boundary. In all cases, the rectangle\nmoves along with the lithospheric plate (i.e.,\ntoward the right). Figure 6a therefore follows the\nstructure development for a fairly young litho-\nspheric plate, whereas Figure 6c shows results\nfor an older lithosphere. Although those three sets\nof results are qualitatively similar, rotation time-\nscales are shorter for older parts of the lithosphere\n(Figure 6c) than for younger parts (Figure 6a).\nCase 1 shows a rather constant angle of >50\u0006 for\nFigure 5. Horizontal cross section of the temperature\nfield at 150 km depth. As Figure 3, but for Case 3: D h =\n1. During the full 80 Ma of model calculation, rolls do\nnot clearly align with the new plate motion. Instead, dot\nstructures indicate plume like downwellings, and\ntransverse roll structures perpendicular to the plate\nmotion are visible. A depiction of this process is\navailable as Animation 3.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 van hunen and zhong: mantle convective structure 10.1029\/2005GC001209\n8 of 14\nthe first 20 Ma. This corresponds to the initial angle\nof 60\u0006 imposed by the rotation. After that, a gradual\ndecrease of the dominant angle sets in, which\nreaches a new equilibrium value around 0\u0006 after\nabout 30\u201360 Ma, depending on the part of the\nlithosphere for which the calculations are per-\nformed. As also shown in Figure 4, the case with\nnonlinear rheology changes its dominant roll angle\nmuch quicker: decrease of that angle sets in imme-\ndiately after the plate motion rotation, and reaches\n10\u0006 in about 25 Ma. After that the angle does not\ndecrease any further. Case 3 shows no significant\nangle decrease in the first 50\u201360 Ma. After that, a\nchange in orientation toward 0\u0006 also occurs in this\ncase.\n[22] Seven more cases (four with Newtonian rhe-\nology, and three with non-Newtonian rheology) are\nshown in Figures 6a\u20136c. Case 4 has increased\nshearing, because the shearing zone is confined\nto the depth range between the bottom of the\nlithosphere and 300 km depth instead of 400. This\nresults in a faster realignment of the rolls with the\nnew plate motion. Case 5 has a reduced plate\nvelocity, and therefore also a reduced shearing,\nsimilar to Case 3. Also the realignment is slower\nthan in the default Case 1, as expected. An in-\ncreased activation energy in Case 6 from 120 to\n360 kJ\/mol has no significant effect on the realign-\nment time. This is rather surprising given the fact\nthat the activation energy plays such a dominant\nrole in the vigor and amount of small-scale con-\nvection [Davaille and Jaupart, 1994; Solomatov,\n1995; Choblet and Sotin, 2000; Huang et al., 2003;\nKorenaga and Jordan, 2003; van Hunen et al.,\n2005]. All the previous cases had approximately\nsimilar SSC onset times of around 70 Ma. In\nCase 7, we reduced the SSC onset time (measured\nin the initial phase) to about 35 Ma by decreasing\nthe effective mantle viscosity (and thus increasing\nRa)(Case 7). This case shows the same initial\nperiod of little change in angle b, but after this\nperiod, alignment with the new plate motion direc-\ntion is significantly faster. Case 8 is similar to the\nFigure 6. Dominant roll angle b of the roll structures with respect to the new plate motion direction in the red\nrectangular area shown in Figure 2c. In all calculations, the rectangle moved along with the plate. The initial location\nof the left edge of the rectangle was located at (a) 2000 km, (b) 4000 km, and (c) 6000 km from the inflow boundary.\nModel parameters are described in Table 2. See text for method description of the calculation of b.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 van hunen and zhong: mantle convective structure 10.1029\/2005GC001209\n9 of 14\nnon-Newtonian rheology Case 2, but the activation\nenergy is increased from 360 kJ\/mol to 540 kJ\/mol.\nRa is increased as well to keep the SSC onset time\ncomparable to Cases 1\u20136. Figure 6a shows very\nlittle difference with Case 2, and Figures 6b and 6c\nshow a small delay in the realignment compared to\nCase 2. Case 9 is again comparable to Case 2, but\nhas a smaller SSC onset time of about 35 Ma.\nFigure 6a shows that realignment is very little\naffected by this change, and Figures 6b and 6c\nshow a slightly earlier realignment compared to\nCase 2. In the final Case 10, we removed the\nrheological boundary at 400 km depth, and extended\nthe upper mantle rheology down to 670 km depth,\nsimilar to Case 3, but for non-Newtonian rheology.\nThe effect is also comparable to Case 3, but less\ndramatic: realignment is delayed in all cases shown\nin Figures 6a\u20136c.\n4. Discussion\n[23] The results suggest that shearing and type of\nrheology both play an important role in the re-\nalignment period. We investigate these results here\nin some more detail. As a first-order estimate, the\nstrain rate produced by the plate motion with\nrespect to the deep mantle can be estimated by\ndividing the plate speed by the thickness of the\nshear layer. This shear layer extends from approxi-\nmately 100 km depth (the typical depth of the\nbottom of the lithosphere in all calculations) to the\ndepth of the rheological boundary at 300 or 400 km\ndepth, or, if this boundary is absent, to the bottom\nof the model domain at 670 km depth. Results are\ngiven in Table 2 as _\u0004pl. Another type of shearing is\ncreated by the SSC itself. Although the orientation\nof this shearing is not uniform as with shearing due\nto the large-scale plate motion, this strain rate\nmight still affect the realignment period in some\nway. Solomatov and Moresi [2000] provide an\nestimate for the SSC velocity (their equation (28)).\nBy dividing this velocity by the typical length\nscale of the SSC convection cells, we obtain a\ntypical strain rate produced in the SSC cells.\nAlthough this SSC length scale differs somewhat\nfrom case to case, we decided to use 200 km as a\ntypical value. Results are given in Table 2 as _\u0004SSC.\nWe estimate the total strain rate from both plate\nmotion and SSC motion by simply adding the two\nstrain rates. We quantify the relation between this\ntotal strain rate and the characteristic realignment\ntime in Figure 7. Here we defined this character-\nistic realignment time as the time it takes for the\nangle b to reach 30 degrees (i.e., halfway between\nthe old and the new plate motion direction angle).\nThese values are added to Table 2 as t2000, t4000,\nand t6000 for results from Figures 6a\u20136c, respec-\ntively. The different colors in Figure 7 represent\nresults from Figures 6a\u20136c. The correlation is\nrather good, given the intrinsic randomness of\nthe SSC process [Huang et al., 2003], and both\nNewtonian and non-Newtonian results have the\nsame correlation between realignment period and\ntotal strain rate.\n[24] Figures 6a\u20136c show that rotation of the dom-\ninant structures toward the new plate motion does\nnot occur in the same way for all shown calcula-\ntions. We might be able to split the total \u2018\u2018realign-\nment period\u2019\u2019 (the period needed from rotation to\ncomplete alignment with the new plate motion\ndirection) into an initial \u2018\u2018delay period\u2019\u2019 (in which\nthe dominant angle b remains more or less con-\nstant), and a \u2018\u2018rotation period\u2019\u2019 (which describes the\nrather rapid decrease of angle b, and thus the actual\nrotation of the dominant structures). Note that the\ncharacteristic realignment time defined above rep-\nresents some average of the total realignment\nperiod and the delay period. Some cases have a\nlong delay period: they keep their initial angle\nclose to 60\u0006 for a long period of time (Cases 3\nand 5) before significant rotation occurs. Other\ncases (Cases 2, 4, and 8\u201310) start rotating almost\nimmediately after the change in plate motion\ndirection. There seems to be a relationship between\nthe large-scale shear strain rate due to plate motion\nFigure 7. Correlation of the characteristic realignment\nperiod (see text) with the total shear as a result of plate\nmotion and SSC. Different colors refer to different\ninitial location of the red rectangular in Figure 2c at\n2000, 4000, and 6000 km from the inflow boundary.\nCharacteristic realignment periods are measured from\nFigures 6a\u20136c and are given in Table 2.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 van hunen and zhong: mantle convective structure 10.1029\/2005GC001209\n10 of 14\nand this delay period: Case 3 has a more distributed\nshear, and Case 5 has less shear due to a slower\nplate motion, while Case 4 has all shear concen-\ntrated in a shallow layer below the lithosphere. The\nreason for the absence of this delay period in the\ncase with nonlinear rheology (Cases 2, and 8\u201310)\nis related to the large SSC shearing of those cases.\nThe rotation period is completed in 10 Ma for most\ncalculations.\n[25] The activation energy E* plays an important\nrole in the development of SSC [e.g., Huang et al.,\n2003; van Hunen et al., 2005]. It may therefore be\nsurprising to see that the influence of E* on the\nrealignment period is very small. This realignment\nperiod is predominantly influenced by the local\namount of shearing. Both the large-scale plate-\ninduced shearing and the shearing by SSC are\nindependent of E*. Large-scale shearing only\ndepends on vpl and the depth of asthenosphere,\nwhile in case of small-scale shearing, E* is almost\ncompletely balanced by a similar change in the\nappropriate Rayleigh number [Solomatov and\nMoresi, 2000] to keep the onset time unchanged.\nTimescales for realignment are shorter for older\nparts of the plate (compare Figures 6a\u20136c). One\nreason for that probably is that the thicker old\nlithosphere reduces the thickness of the underlying\nasthenosphere, and therefore increases the local\nlarge-scale strain rate. Figure 6 also shows that\nafter rotation, not all angles approach b = 0\u0006: the\nnonlinear rheology Cases 2, and 8\u201310 only reaches\n10\u201320\u0006, and does not decrease any further, while\nCases 3 and 7 have their angle b drop to values as\nlow as \t20\u0006. All these Cases have a relatively\nlarge _\u0004SSC to _\u0004pl ratio, which indicates that the more\ndominant the shearing by plate motion is compared\nto shearing by SSC, the better the realignment with\nthe new plate motion direction (and the smaller the\nabsolute value of b). The deviation of realignment\nangle from its expected value b = 0\u0006 is most likely\nrelated to the laterally varying age of the inflowing\nplate in the restart phase. This age variation is\npartly the result of the present model setup, and\ngives rise to large-scale nonzero lithospheric thick-\nness variations and mantle flow components in the\ndirection perpendicular to the plate motion direc-\ntion. However, such plate thickness variation and\nmantle flow perpendicular to the plate motion\nmight be present in the Pacific as well to some\nextent, and a perfect b = 0\u0006 should perhaps not be\nexpected.\n[26] Recently, the debate on the fixity of hot spots\nhas been refueled by evidence for southward\nmotion of the Hawaiian hot spot until 43\u201347 Ma\n[Tarduno et al., 2003; Steinberger et al., 2004].\nThe similarity of the shapes of the Hawaiian and\nLouisville hot spots suggests, that if the plume\nlocations were moving south in the past, it must\nhave been occurring on a large scale [Tarduno et\nal., 2003], and probably involved a southward\nmotion of the local lower mantle. Concerning\nupper mantle shearing direction (which determines\nthe SSC roll development and orientation), there is\nno difference between the Pacific plate ceasing to\nmove North or the lower mantle (including the\nmantle plumes) ceasing to move South at around\n43\u201347 Ma, because only the relative motion\nbetween the Pacific plate and the deep mantle is\nresponsible for the shearing. Therefore our results\nmay be valid for either the case of southward\nmotion of Hawaii and Louisville or northward\nmotion of the Pacific plate.\n[27] Our present knowledge of the rheological\nconditions in the Pacific upper mantle may not be\naccurate enough to distinguish between the pre-\nsented rheological models. Therefore future obser-\nvations of mantle structure below Pacific\nlithosphere older than 43\u201347 Ma may give us\nvaluable information. Chains of intraplate volca-\nnism may help us in this case, because their origin\nmight be related to small-scale convection under-\nneath [Haxby and Weissel, 1986; Doin and\nFleitout, 1996; Raddick et al., 2002]. Some sea-\nmount chains such as Puka Puka and Crossgrain\nRidges [Lynch, 1999], seamounts between Ducie\nIsland and the Easter microplate [Searle et al.,\n1995] or the Sojourn Ridges [Forsyth et al., 2002;\nForsyth, 2004] have a rather random age progres-\nsion (although often with a clear trend [Lynch,\n1999]), and small-scale convection has been sug-\ngested as a possible mechanism to explain those\nridges. Those chains all align roughly with the\npresent-day plate motion direction, and comparing\ntheir age with the age of the HEB gives us an upper\nlimit for the realignment period. Most of these\nridges are significantly younger than the suggested\n43\u201347 age of the HEB, but even those ridges\nsuggest that realignment does not take longer than\naround 40 Ma. The Crossgrain ridges sit on 60\u2013\n80 Ma seafloor and their actual age range could be\nclose to that of the HEB [Lynch, 1999]. The Cross-\ngrain ridges have propagated roughly from west to\neast, and at their most western, and probably oldest\nend, they blend into the more N-S oriented Line\nIslands. This suggests an even shorter realignment\nperiod than predicted by our calculations, and may\nsuggest the need for a thin asthenosphere as well as\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 van hunen and zhong: mantle convective structure 10.1029\/2005GC001209\n11 of 14\na non-Newtonian rheology. Although precise age\nmeasurements are not available yet, future improve-\nments in this direction may provide some useful\nevidence for the formation date of the ridges with\nrespect to the HEB timing.\n[28] Another line of evidence to further constrain\nour rheological parameter space may be the pres-\nence of seismic anisotropy. Several studies indicate\nthat the amplitude of seismic anisotropy in the old\nPacific is small compared to that in the young\nPacific [Nishimura and Forsyth, 1989; Becker et\nal., 2003; Smith et al., 2004]. The seismic anisot-\nropy arising from shearing below the young Pacific\nplate motion might be partly destroyed by the\nappearance of SSC under older oceanic litho-\nsphere. Regular SSC rolls might change, but not\nnecessarily completely destroy large-scale anisot-\nropy. But some of our calculations also show rather\nchaotic convection, in which anisotropy would\nprobably be completely random in small length\nscales, and therefore canceling on the larger length\nscales at which anisotropy is measured. Our results\nshow that, after a change in relative plate motion\ndirection, the roll structure changes from a rather\nregular pattern of parallel roll structures to a more\nchaotic pattern for several tens of Ma. If conditions\nare favorable, a new regular roll pattern emerges\nafterward. We hypothesize that regular SSC might\nstill be able to preserve or newly create seismic\nfabric, but that especially during this chaotic re-\nalignment phase, any present fabric might be\ndestroyed. Furthermore, maps of seismic anisotro-\npy suggest that the oldest parts of the Pacific\nlithosphere have a preferred orientation of the\nseismic velocities that in the shallow portions of\nthe plate align with the (frozen-in) paleo-spreading\ndirection at shallow depth, and in the deeper\nportions tend to align with the present-day plate\nmotion in deeper portions of the lithosphere\n[Nishimura and Forsyth, 1989; Smith et al., 2004].\nIf this anisotropy was formed by SSC at the bottom\nof the lithosphere, the depth of anisotropy may be\nrelated to a thickness of the lithosphere at the time of\nfabric formation, and thus a lithospheric age, which\nmight give us more information on the orientation of\nSSC through time for this part of the lithosphere.\nFurther modeling studies are being performed to\nquantify the evolution of seismic anisotropy in the\npresence of SSC.\n5. Conclusions\n[29] SSC rolls tend to align with plate motion, and\na sudden change in relative plate motion direction\nwould have an influence on the roll structure.\nUnderstanding the development of these SSC rolls\nafter such event is important for our understanding\nof possibly related processes such as gravity line-\nations and some intraplate volcanic chains. We\ninvestigated the influence of a change in the\nrelative plate motion on the presence, style, and\nrealignment pattern of small-scale convection. In\nparticular, we focused on the role of rheology. Our\nmodel results show that complete realignment of\nroll structures with the new plate motion direction\ncan be expected within 20 Ma, but might also take\nmuch longer, depending on the rheological param-\neters. The most important influence on the realign-\nment period is the shear force from both large-scale\nshear between the lithosphere and the deeper man-\ntle, and small-scale shear created by the SSC itself.\nThe realignment period is inversely correlated to\nthe total shear, and therefore positively correlated\nto the thickness of the shear layer and the vigor of\nSSC, and negatively correlated to the relative plate\nvelocity. Dislocation creep rheology reorientation\ntakes much less time than with diffusion creep\nrheology, because shear rates are much higher in\nthe first case. Unlike in the onset time, scale and\nvigor of SSC [e.g., Huang et al., 2003; van Hunen\net al., 2005], the activation energy E* plays a very\nminor role in the realignment phase, because it does\nnot significantly influence the shear rates.\nAcknowledgments\n[30] Two reviewers (Caroline Dumoulin and Garrett Ito),\nassociate editor Magali Billen, and editor Peter van Keken\nare thanked for their many good suggestions to improve the\nmanuscript.
