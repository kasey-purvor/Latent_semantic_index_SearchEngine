The\nfirst of two companion papers, this contribution aims to examine the issue of\nachieving business relevance in BLD and the quality of HR\/management development\nstrategy formulation. Design\/methodology\/approach \u2013 The paper analyses four\norganisation case studies of BLD strategy derived from interview data sourced\nfrom 103 senior line\/HRD managers in 20 organisations. Findings \u2013 The findings\nhighlight the need for HRD managers to take a discriminating approach to linking\nBLD strategy, development method, evaluation and the role of management\ndevelopment.

The predictable growth in leadership development activity has\nbeen accompanied by a wealth of best practice advice on how to design and implement\neffective leadership development (see, for example, Lee, 1996; Zenger et al., 2000; Cacioppe,\n1998; Ready and Conger, 2003). Much of this advice is encapsulated by Fulmer and Wagner\n(1999) in eight principles: aligning leadership development to business strategy; developing\nan HR and business partnership; using competency frameworks; developing home grown\ntalent; forging strong links to succession planning; encouraging action learning; ensuring\nhigh level support for development activity; and, comprehensive evaluation of outcomes.\nHowever there are evident difficulties in implementing these ideas in practice (Gratton et al.,\n1999; Ogbonna and Whipp, 1999; Truss, 2001).\nCriticisms of current practice indicate; poor evaluation of outcomes (Axel, 1999; Mabey and\nThomson, 2000; Santos and Stuart, 2003; Preskill and Lackey, 1999); the over use of\ncompetency frameworks (Hayes et al., 2000; Conger and Xin, 2000); and concerns about\nHR\/MD managers ability to influence the business and to take a strategic overview (Guest\nand King, 2004; Meldrum and Atkinson, 1998; Tate, 2004; Thomson et al., 1997). These\nspecific criticisms reflect a wider specialist debate (Ogbonna and Whipp, 1999) concerning\nthe overall strategic integration between HRM and the business, the complexities of which\nare summarised in Colbert (2004). In short, this discourse focuses on the relative value of:\nvertical fit, integration between business and HRM strategy (Schuler and Jackson, 1987);\nhorizontal integration, bundling HRM activities and process to create synergies (Baird and\nMeshoulam, 1988); and \u201cflexibility\u201d of response over time, (Wright and Snell, 1998; Gratton\net al., 1999; Truss, 2001). More recently, Colbert (2004) extended this latter approach to\naccommodate a complexity perspective in which HRM strategy is conceived in terms of\nenabling organizations to constantly co-evolve with their environment.\nNotwithstanding this potential insight, Sheehan (2005) notes that we are still some way from\nrealising strategic integration of HRM in practice. Not surprisingly this problem is seen as\ncritical in the domain of management development (House and Aditya, 1997; Mabey and\nThomson, 2000; Ready, 2004; Mabey, 2005). Moreover, with insufficiently rigorous data on\nthe effectiveness of leadership development approaches, the relative strategic impact of\ndevelopment activities remains an area of conjecture (Fiedler, 1996; Mabey, 2002). So, is\nbest practice advice fundamentally flawed or is it simply in need of refinement or\ncontextualisation?\nThis question marked the starting point of a two-phase research project to provide a critical\nunderstanding of the current state of business leadership development (BLD) and to identify\ndirections for innovative future practice. The results of phase one, based on the BLD\nexperience in 20 UK organizations, reported in Clarke et al. (2004) and Clarke and Bailey\n(2002), revealed the extent to which BLD in practice is an unfocussed and extremely diffuse\nactivity, which is not evaluated well and poorly aligned to business needs. This malaise was\nfound to be the product of four interrelated factors:\n1. Aligning BLD strategy to received HR wisdom about best practice rather than the\nmedium\/long-term business needs.\n2. Lack of senior management vision for BLD.\n3. Poor quality HR thinking.\n4. Differing agendas and organizational politics.\nWhen combined, these four factors serve to create \u201ccatch 22\u201d situations where development\nis fundamentally undermined by mutually limiting constraints. For example, attempts to\nmake better organizational use of BLD are restricted when senior managers have a limited\nview of its value, a view that is only likely to change through their own experience of BLD.\nIn response to this widespread lack of coherence in approach, phase two of the research\nsought to understand how those involved in BLD made sense of their situation and came to\ndecisions about strategy and action that enabled them to overcome this complex set of\nunfavourable circumstances. This involved an international survey of views about BLD\npractice and the analysis of cases of successful and innovative BLD activity identified in\nphase one.\nThe cases used in this paper allow us to explore two of the barriers to effective BLD cited\npreviously; the issue of achieving business relevance in BLD and the quality of\nHR\/management development strategy formulation. A companion contribution to Journal of\nManagement Development (Clarke et al., 2008, uses cases to explore the other two barriers\nby focussing on the influence of competing political agendas on BLD and how HRD\nprofessionals work within this context.\nWe adopt a critical realist perspective (Bhaskar, 1974; Ackroyd and Fleetwood, 2000) in\nwhich organization, structure, culture and strategy are seen to co-exist but act independently\nof each other (Chia, 2002; Fairclough, 2005), as this perspective lends itself to analysing the\nrelations between the unobservable, causal or generative mechanisms of effective BLD; the\nsocial structures, powers and relations that govern them, and their observable effects (Chia,\n2002; Blaikie, 1993; Partington, 2002). Our research therefore seeks to make a contribution\nby identifying potential generative mechanisms that produce patterns of effective BLD,\nparticularly in relation to achieving business relevance and strategic alignment. Also,\nfollowing Buchanan (1999), these qualitative cases are presented as vehicles for personal\nlearning; written as potential \u201cclassroom\u201d cases we hope that they can be used to stimulate\ndebate about the processes of strategic alignment. Using only four cases our purpose is thus\nexploration rather than prediction. On this basis, practical suggestions for HR\/development\nprofessionals struggling to make a difference in similar situations is provided and potential\nareas for further research are identified.\nStrategic integration of BLD\nThe drive for integration has become critical as management development is increasingly\nseen as a key lever in organization change, in embedding new organization values (Doyle,\n1995) and improving business performance (Mabey, 2005). Yet achieving strategic relevance\nseems problematic.\nFor example, Rainbird's (1994) analysis of 21 cases revealed a lack of integration between\nHR and management development and the business. And several studies have found that\nalthough the main drivers of management development appeared to be strategic, development\nin practice is more directly influenced by individual job related requirements identified\nthrough the appraisal process and requests from line managers (Thomson et al., 1997;\nCannell et al., 2000; Sung and Quinn, 2005). Mabey's (2005) recent study shows a continuing\ngap between management development activities and business strategy.\nThe literature offers two potential reasons why management development falls short of\nstrategic relevance: the quality of MD\/HR professionals, and the complexity of the task.\nWhile a number of studies highlight concerns about the quality of HR professionals in\ngeneral (Sheehan, 2005; Guest and King, 2004), Meldrum and Atkinson's (1998) study of\nmanagement development professionals in particular found line management to be largely\nambivalent or negative about the organizational influence of HR professionals, their ability to\nact as good role models, to match needs to developmental activities, and, significantly, in\nterms of their strategic overview of the business.\nConcerns about the quality of training and development thinking have been voiced by Mole\n(1996), Tate (2004) and by Thomson et al. (1997) in their study of over 900 organizations:\n\u2026 there was not a great deal of evidence of deep thinking about management development,\neither in learning processes or in respect of an operational model or in how to link it to\norganizational strategies (Thomson et al., 1997, p. 79).\nOn this basis alone it is perhaps not surprising that the application of \u201cbest practice\u201d\napproaches to strategic alignment, such as; gaining senior management buy-in (Fulmer and\nWagner, 1999; Sung and Quinn, 2005); working on real projects that link to key\norganizational issues (Zenger et al., 2000; Ready and Conger, 2003); and, developing in-\ncompany programmes that concentrate on live organizational issues (Conger and Benjamin,\n1999; Zenger et al., 2000), may well be difficult to achieve. However there is also evidence\nthat the principles themselves may need refinement.\nFor example, obtaining senior management buy-in implies a degree of organizational order\nand rationality that may not reflect organizational reality (Francis, 2002; Skinner and Mabey,\n1997). In today's environment where organizations increasingly resemble fragmented market\nplaces of competing and mutual interest groups (Colbert, 2004; Butcher and Clarke, 2001) it\nis often difficult to obtain collective agreement about an activity perceived to be of doubtful\nvalue when set against short-term priorities (Sung and Quinn, 2005).\nWhile it is apparently accepted wisdom that in-company development programmes are most\ncost-effective and fit better with the development of strategic leaders (Conger and Benjamin,\n1999; Sung and Quinn, 2005) and public or open development programmes \u201ctend to have\nlittle impact on a leader's ability to produce better results\u201d (Zenger et al., 2000, p. 27), studies\nof evaluation practices question the bases for these conclusions (Axel, 1999; Mabey and\nThomson, 2000; Santos and Stuart, 2003; Sung and Quinn, 2005). Cairns (1997) for example\nfound that half of the evaluations of open executive programmes focussed on immediate post\nprogramme effects and only 6 per cent evaluated the effectiveness after one year. For in-\ncompany programmes, only 18 per cent assessed impact one year later. Furthermore, while\nin-company activities potentially provide greater scope for projects that are relevant to both\nindividual and strategic intent, these action learning projects contain inherent shortcomings\nsuch as \u201clearner defensiveness\u201d (Hardingham, 1999), lack of external strategic thinking and\ndeep transformational learning (Conger and Xin, 2000).\nThese issues formed the background to phase two of this study in which we sought to identify\ncase studies that would highlight factors that seem to enable effective BLD strategy\nformulation and implementation and reveal how HR\/MD professionals tackle the\ncomplexities of strategic integration in practice.\nResearch methodology\nPhase one\nThe case studies reported in the following were derived from the phase one research, which\nwas designed to explore the potential gaps between BLD theory and practice, strategic intent\nand practical experience of BLD. From a relativist perspective, phase one reflected the\n\u201cempirical\u201d phase of our enquiry, to produce a critical description of what is known about\nBLD (Blaikie, 1993). For the critical realist, gaining access to reality is considered\nproblematic (Easterby-Smith et al., 2002) and in consequence our design sought to access a\nbroad range of perspectives. This sample consisted of interview data from 103 managers in\n20 organizations that were selected to represent a broad cross section of industries, size and\nincluded several multinational enterprises. The generalisability of findings was checked by a\npostal questionnaire representing a further 87 managers from companies in Europe, Africa\nand the Far East.\nIn response to criticism of HRM studies that rely on single HR responses (Purcell, 1999;\nTruss, 2001; Schneider et al., 2003) and in line with a relativist perspective that recognises\ncompeting claims about the nature of the social world and thus the likelihood of finding\n\u201csupporter's opponents and doubters\u201d (Pettigrew, 1990), four different organizational\nperspectives were explored to permit a level of triangulation; senior business managers, BLD\nrecipients, HR\/MD managers responsible for BLD strategy and those responsible for BLD\nprovision.\nOne-hour interviews were built around 20 question sets (see the Appendix) designed to\nsurface perceptions about relationships postulated in an initial model of effective BLD. The\nmodel suggested a self-reinforcing set of relationships between; the strategic context for\nBLD, its drivers, BLD activity, and its perceived impact. Semi-structured interviews were\nused as this approach allowed exploration of the perceived relationships between the different\nelements. The tendency for socially desirable responses was minimised by assuring\nconfidentiality and anonymity (Johnson and Johnson, 2002). Validity was further enhanced\nby encouraging anecdotal illustrations of responses, as these can reveal tacit thinking and\norganization activities not easily surfaced through other methods (Ambrosini and Bowman,\n2002).\nInterviews were recorded, transcribed and entered into a proprietary database management\ntool. Results were analysed by total sample, by organizational role, and within-company, the\ncollection of four different perspectives allowing us to triangulate responses to further\nenhance validity. An organization focus to early questions served to ensure that personal\nexperiences could be understood in context, and thus reduce any tendency to make simplistic\nassumptions about cross sample generalisability (Johnson and Johnson, 2002).\nResponses were content analysed using standard practices for qualitative data such as those\ndescribed by Miles and Huberman (1994); Milliken et al. (2003). To increase reliability, data\nwere initially analysed separately by research team members and final coding constructs\nrefined as a result of further cross team discussion. Results are reported in Clarke et al.\n(2004) and Clarke and Bailey (2002).\nPhase two\nGiven the lack of coherence found between BLD strategy and implementation, Phase Two\nwas designed to identify a range of solutions or \u201crational explanations\u201d (Blaikie, 1993) that\nwould allow organizations to break the negative and self-perpetuating Catch 22 situations we\nhad identified, and to develop alternative approaches to effective BLD. A case study\napproach was considered appropriate, as this would allow us to focus on examples of\neffective practice and thus better understand the generative mechanisms that impact on the\nconnections between business strategy, leadership development and the contribution of\nHR\/MD. In particular, it would enable us to understand the context in which individuals,\nacting purposely, unconsciously draw upon, reproduce and moderate existing structures,\npowers and relationships (Ackroyd and Fleetwood, 2000).\nThe cases reported in the following were identified by applying two criteria: first, to ensure\nthat organizations were representative of current leadership development thinking, the\nselected cases were required to reflect a majority (at least five) of the eight principles\nidentified by Fulmer and Wagner (1999). Second, we chose cases so as to illustrate the\nsuccessful application of one of four distinct BLD strategies that had emerged from phase one\n(see Figure 1). The BLD strategy framework differentiates and defines approaches to BLD\naccording to the nature of their content (is content corporately consistent or individualised?)\nand according to development population coverage (is the population targeted or inclusive?).\nThis meta-level framework allowed us to study BLD in different environments (Pettigrew,\n1990; Harrison, 2002). Rather than seeking to establish broad generalisability, it was intended\nthat the case data would facilitate an explanation about the structure, process and generative\nmechanisms in these individual circumstances.\nThe four distinguishable approaches to BLD which we sought to illustrate are:\n1. HiPo tailored \u2013 highly targeted\/individualised provision \u2013 a structured approach\ndriven by the need for succession planning that targets high potential managers\nthrough talent spotting processes and nurtures individual development through\ntailored activities.\n2. HiPo programme \u2013 highly targeted\/corporately consistent provision \u2013 groups of\nmanagers are identified and proceed through a series of planned and consistent HiPo\nactivities based on corporate business needs.\n3. Self-motivated \u2013 inclusive\/individualised provision \u2013 no defined approach,\ndevelopment is open to all but dependent on an individual's own motivation and skill\nin making things happen for themselves.\n4. Generic programme approach \u2013 inclusive\/corporately consistent provision \u2013\ncorporate wide programmes to develop\/ improve specific organization capabilities,\noften cascaded down through different levels of management.\nAlthough not mutually exclusive approaches, as some organizations employed more than one\napproach in different divisions, we concentrated on a particularly successful example of each\nto highlight four very different, yet valuable BLD strategies and to describe why and how\neach was found to be effective for the business context in which it was adopted. The intent\nwas to explore how strategic alignment can be achieved, to provide comparative information\non development strategies and to offer ideas about alternative approaches.\nFigure 1BLD strategy framework\nThe four case organizations reported here are: BANKCO, SOFTCO, PARCELCO and\nRETAILCO. Commensurate with a relativist ontology, the Phase One design sought to\nexplore multiple perspectives through a corroborative design based upon five to six\ninterviews from different organizational perspectives. These data were supplemented by\nadditional interviews with key contacts within each business, and with publicly available\ndata, used primarily to confirm specific details rather than add to the substantive content.\nInitial pattern codes derived from the BLD Strategy Framework were used to develop interim\ncase summaries that became the focus for case meetings among the researc\ncodes were refined and a list of variables created for each case. These were used as the basis\nfor initial causal mapping. Cross case maps were constructed using variables estimated to be\nthe most influential in accounting for the outcomes de\nvariables are discussed later in the paper. Our main HR\/MD contact in each organization was\ngiven an opportunity to critique\/comment on the case content. None of these observations\nnecessitated substantive revisions.\nEach case presented in the following describes the organizational context for development,\nthe company's approach to business leadership development in relation to the BLD Strategy\nFramework and briefly summarises the key aspects of each.\nscribed in each organization. These\nh team. These\nBANKCO: HiPo tailored\nThe financial services industry is still subject to enormous change. In a huge deregulated\nmarket with low barriers to entry, competition is intense, and new entrants are quick to\ncapitalise on the blurring of the traditional boundaries between retail and investment banking\nand the insurance sector. For leading international players like BANKCO, this continues to\nbe a global challenge. At the time of writing, their executives were being asked to tackle\nproblems unimaginable ten years previously. But turning the direction of an organization of\nmany tens of thousands of people was taking time and required a steady supply of managers\nwho were able to think innovatively outside of their role, organization and industry.\nIt was this business need that formed a distinctive focus for BANKCO's approach to\nmanagement and leadership development. In particular, they had been careful to distinguish\nbetween the development needs of their future business leaders and those of other managers.\nThe bank needed leaders who were able to cope with high levels of uncertainty and\nambiguity in order to be able to deliver and continue to develop its future strategy.\nIn consequence there were very clear development processes for the top 200 executives.\nDevelopment was managed through two separate programmes; the Group Executive\nResource (GER) for the top 50 managers and the Top Management Resource (TMR) for the\nnext 150 high potential managers. These populations were nurtured by an eight person\nexecutive resourcing team. Donal, who led the team, believed that the business need for good\nsuccession planning was so well accepted by the board that:\n\u2026 getting the time and sponsorship the team needs to carry out these programmes is not an\nissue.\nIndeed, it was also evident that the Chief Executive saw good succession planning as a key\npriority for the business.\nIn both programmes managers attended an externally managed assessment centre where they\nwere assessed against a limited set of bespoke competencies that reflected the senior\nmanagement capabilities required by the business, given its history, culture and future\naspirations. These included new behaviours for the bank such as \u201crestless curiosity\u201d, the\nability to take an external perspective and to successfully bring that inside BANKCO and the\nability to build good relationships, not just with peers and team members but also in\npartnerships, joint ventures and with suppliers. While many of these competencies were\nrelatively new to the bank, importantly they were viewed as changeable. As Donal pointed\nout,\n\u2026 these are designed to take us into the future but they may well need to be reviewed in two\nor three years time to ensure we stay ahead of the game. The model is a fluid living thing and\nwill need to develop over time.\nFollowing initial assessment individual development was tailored according to each senior\nmanager's requirements. Each person in the GER had their own \u201caccount manager\u201d from\nwithin the executive resourcing team to ensure that resources and opportunities were\noptimised. The range of activities available was wide. Managers could attend external\nprogrammes at well-known business schools and participate in one-to-one coaching with\nexternal coaches. They would have an internal mentor, usually a company director and\nreceive regular 360-degree assessments and carefully selected job moves. They could also\nattend business consortia programmes to rub shoulders with peers from other leading\norganizations and were encouraged to network to share their insights and know-how.\nAt the point of data collection it was relatively early days to measure the effectiveness of this\napproach and there was some debate as to the most appropriate measures. However, the\nmetrics that were being used focussed on what the bank called \u201ctalent flows,\u201d the number of\ncareer moves by the GER group across, and up through the hierarchy, and recruitment and\nretention rates for this high potential population. Consideration was also given to senior\nexecutive and GER views about the quality of the talent pool. Donal was:\n\u2026 doubtful as to the practicality of identifying more concrete processes of evaluating the\neffectiveness of the initiative, despite recent advances in human capital accounting.\nThroughout our interviews with HR and line managers it was clear that both believed that\nsuch activity had a direct positive impact on current and future business performance.\nThis case example illustrates the HiPo tailored approach. With the huge upheaval in financial\nservices the bank's senior management identified that succession planning was a major\npriority and that leadership development played a key role in preparing potential successors\nfor the uncertainty and ambiguity of the globally competitive environment by developing the\nability to work, form productive relationships and incorporate ideas from outside their\nbusiness and industry. But, given BANKCO's culture, and the uncertainty about the future of\nthe industry, attention was given to developing a new approach to leadership development,\none that, in the words of one senior manager\n\u2026 helps managers understand what is expected of them without being prescriptive.\nThis directly influenced the individualised BLD approach the company adopted. The\ncompany was highly selective about who forms the GER but not at all prescriptive about the\ndevelopment process. A broad range of opportunities was made available to develop these\ncapabilities. While at the time of data collection it was still early days, the success of this\napproach was evident in the time and resources it received from senior management, the\ninvestment the programme attracted and the positive feedback about it from those involved.\nSOFTCO \u2013 HiPo programme\nIn 2001 SOFTCO was a small independent software and services business focussed on niche\nfinancial applications, employing around 600 employees in the UK, the USA and Asia\nPacific region. In a highly competitive market still coming to terms with the impact of e-\nbusiness, senior managers had become aware of the need to improve SOFTCO's operational\nflexibility in providing cross product\/service solutions for customers. There was common\nagreement among the senior group that the company needed to develop its ability to become\nmore responsive to customer requirements and needed to encourage greater levels of pro-\nactivity and cross functional working in its management population. However, the company\nwas under pressure to improve its financial performance, did not have a history of formal\nbusiness leadership development and not all the senior team recognised the value of\nleadership development as a way of tackling these business issues. As one senior manager,\nSteve, remarked\n\u2026 the CEO and the FD know the cost of everything and the value of nothing.\nDespite these unfavourable circumstances and the lack of a clear executive commitment, Bill\nthe HR Development Director and some senior colleagues developed a strategy to use\nleadership development to tackle these critical business issues:\n\u2026 in short, the strategy is to identify high potential managers who will receive shared and\nconsistent development that focuses on knowledge sharing and innovation. These managers\nare being encouraged to create \u201cpockets of good practice\u201d to role model change for the rest of\nthe business.\nThe Management Action Programme (MAP) established by Bill was developed for a limited\nnumber of high potential UK middle managers selected by the small group of senior\ncolleagues. While this approach attracted some concerns about elitism, Bill and his\ncolleagues considered that:\n\u2026 working within tight time frames and a limited budget, and in the absence of a validated\nassessment tool, executive managerial judgement about those most able to benefit can be an\neffective approach.\nOn the surface, the programme content was not unusual. Its aim, in line with agreed business\nneeds was to improve cross-functional working and equip managers to take more\nresponsibility to \u201cmake things happen\u201d. What was particularly noteworthy was the way in\nwhich the programme integrated personal development with key business issues. As well as\nproviding much needed business knowledge the programme deliberately fostered a real sense\nof group identity to enable them to work collectively and independently to initiate change,\nsometimes, despite considerable organizational constraints.\nProgramme evaluation was predominantly anecdotal but both the target population and other\nsenior managers noted a number of significant outcomes. For example, the participants felt\nthey were more open with each other after the programme so that it became easier to achieve\ncross-functional activities. As one participant, Kevin, put it:\n\u2026 we had a ready built network to help implement new ideas.\nThey also felt more confident, tackling difficult issues without needing to seek permission\nand better able to see the bigger business picture. The action learning projects resulted in the\nsuccessful introduction of a new customer care strategy that led to a 200 per cent reduction in\ncustomer complaints and a corporate intranet that was believed to have substantially\nimproved cross organizational working.\nSignificantly, these positive outcomes were achieved in a largely unsupportive environment\nand with a relatively low budget of \u00a330,000. This illustrates what can be achieved through\nbusiness leadership development activity that does not rely on top-down support and\ndevelopment processes. The participants were mainly middle managers and were able to\ninitiate change from the \u201cinside out\u201d. By working on projects that were local and important to\nparticipants and not \u201cimposed\u201d, as is sometimes the case in such initiatives, business benefits\nwere valued and realised. Of particular importance in facilitating this was the HR\nDevelopment Director's deliberate role in both protecting the programme from interference\nfrom those less convinced of its merits and through his leadership of the development project.\nThis leadership was demonstrated in co-presenting the programme, in coaching and\nmentoring, and in helping to clear the path for the business improvement projects.\nHiPo Programmes are characterised by activities that have consistent development content\ncombined with the need to be selective about who receives that development. In this case, the\nHR Director and close colleagues perceived the need to initiate corporate-wide change from\nwithin and therefore selected for participation those managers they believed were capable of\ninitiating and delivering this change and used the MAP as a vehicle for facilitating, focusing\nand creating mutual support for change activities. An inclusive approach would not have\nprovided participants with the same potential and a tailored design might not have produced\nthe same critical mass with a common focus. In contrast to BANKCO, the SOFTCO example\ndemonstrates how targeted programmes do not necessarily require unanimous senior\nmanagement approval nor do they depend on providing a wide range of non-targeted\ndevelopment activities to mitigate concerns about elitism. Instead, in this case, it appeared to\nbe the personal purpose, commitment and leadership of the HR Director that helped make the\nintervention successful.\nPARCELCO: self-motivated\nPARCELCO is a world leader in international air express and an established innovator since\nit commenced operations over 30 years ago. At the time of study it employed over 68,000\npeople servicing 635,000 cities in 228 countries. The most substantial operation outside of\nthe USA is in the UK.\nIn 2001, prompted by several factors, the organization had adopted the \u201cself-motivated\u201d\napproach to business leader development. The culture of PARCELCO had for some time\ngiven a priority to encouraging frontline management autonomy. This provided managers\nwith the opportunity to exploit the company's traditional entrepreneurial spirit, a quality seen\nas particularly important in the highly competitive air express business, as well as the scope\nto deliver the substantial growth the company was experiencing. As the new HR Director\npointed out, this had encouraged a \u201cno nonsense, just do it approach\u201d to the business. In\nconsequence, PARCELCO needed managers who were self sufficient and able to work\nindependently, and a training and development function that had a strong commercial\norientation.\nIn this context, the format for business leader development that emerged was one in which\nindividuals took responsibility for their own development. Such an approach can of course be\nopen to criticism and abuse as it can have the appearance of being highly fragmented,\nindividualistic and lacking any real strategic purpose. However, PARCELCO have been able\nto introduce a number of core processes that have contributed to creating an extremely\npositive development culture consistent with strategic aspirations of the business at that time.\nAs one manager, Simon, described the culture:\nIt's easy to get the development you want, if you have a need, the organization will try and\nmeet it.\nAt the heart of this strong development culture were two development centres, open to all\nmanagers according to organizational level. This, combined with a strong operational\ncompetency framework and a well-supported personal development planning process, meant\nthe company had, as one line manager described it \u201cthe building blocks for individuals to\ndevelop themselves\u201d. The training and development department, described as \u201ceasily\naccessible\u201d in terms of getting support and influential with the senior executive team, was\nseen as significant in creating this culture.\nThus in practice, the PARCELCO approach at that time provided a consistent front-end\nassessment process from which managers at all levels could map out their own development\nfrom a wide range of activities including coaching, work assignments, mentoring, external\nprogrammes, MBA's and educational scholarships. The company provided internal\nprogrammes addressing key commercial activities. There were some development activities\nthat necessitated greater levels of targeting but on the whole this was not as strong as the need\nfor self-motivated development. Despite the apparent open-ended nature of the development\nprocess, the development content was usually aligned to PARCELCO's business needs as\nchoices were based on a well regarded assessment process tied to an organization-wide\ncompetency process.\nThe strategic relevance and sensitivity of this choice of BLD approach was highlighted when\nin the face of increasing competition and a plateau in market growth, PARCELCO identified\nthe need for enhanced operational harmonisation. With a heightened emphasis on global\nsynergies and greater job harmonisation the development function began to play a wider role\nin supporting international succession planning through more corporately consistent\ndevelopment provision. Nevertheless, the \u201cSelf-Motivated\u201d approach to development was\nstill valued but driven by a wider strategic consideration. As the HR Director pointed out:\n\u2026 the idea that there is no longer a job for life is really becoming a challenge for companies.\nManagers are asking \u201cwhat's in it for me?\u201d We need to ensure that we redress the balance by\nproviding people with interesting jobs and development opportunities to personally grow\nthemselves. If we can't, then they, and their knowledge, will walk out of the door.\nIn the self motivated quadrant, organizations are responding to the needs for an inclusive yet\nindividualised strategy. Given the PARCELCO business model that required strong local\nautonomy, it was important, as one senior manager expressed, that \u201ceveryone has the\nopportunity to develop themselves.\u201d To give priority to targeting and corporate consistency\nwould have been countercultural and have generated inappropriate levels of centralisation.\nHowever, by ensuring the establishment of robust selection and assessment processes, the\napproach avoided becoming an uncoordinated \u201cfree for all\u201d but allowed activities to be\naligned to broad business needs. The success of this approach was evident in the extremely\npositive way interviewees talked about PARCELCO's development culture and in their belief\nthat they really did have the opportunity to develop both themselves and their business.\nPerhaps the best evidence of the effectiveness of this approach was the company's ability to\nsustain remarkable organic development over many years.\nRETAILCO: generic programmes\nRETAILCO, one of the UK's leading retailers, at the time of the study had a turnover of \u00a325\nbillion and employed over 250,000 people in the UK, continental Europe and South East\nAsia. At the heart of this success is a business model that ensures a consistently high quality\ncustomer experience. The development of RETAILCO's culture, based on two key values,\n\u201ctreating people how we like to be treated\u201d and \u201cno one tries harder for customers\u201d, was\nconsistent across all its activities and was, and still is, an essential part of this success. The\neffectiveness of such value driven business models depends on the degree to which leaders\nthroughout their organization, role model valued behaviours. Management development has\ntherefore had a significant part to play at RETAILCO in enabling managers to take up this\nchallenge and embed the RETAILCO way of doing things. This also meant that leadership\nand management development activities were closely aligned with RETAILCO's business\nneeds at that time. As one manager, John, put it:\n\u2026 the driver of our management development strategy is to ensure that the organization\ndevelops its capability to deliver our business goals.\nIn consequence, this need to develop a clear \u201cRETAILCO Way\u201d provided the impetus behind\na whole range of corporately consistent inclusive development activities. For example, the\ncompany undertook a five-year programme to ensure that all its 8,000 managers, from the top\nthrough to first line supervision, had a common language about core managerial processes.\nThis included skills programmes that enabled the company to adopt a consistent approach to\neffective meetings, to the use of rapid reaction teams, to coaching and performance feedback,\nto problem solving and decision-making. Despite this predominately inclusive approach some\ntargeting did take place in recognition of the different needs of general management and\nbusiness leader populations, but even then on the basis of corporate consistency. For\nexample, the top 1,500 managers participated in a situational leadership programme and all\nstore managers attended an in-company business school programme. Corporate inductions,\nspecial change programmes and the development of an organization-wide managerial\ncompetency framework supported these types of activities.\nThe success of these generic culture change programmes often lies in an organization's ability\nto take account of employee views about these values in action and to respond to concerns\nabout what they see as being important. Without a real interest in employees, such processes\ncan become overbearing and subject to considerable scepticism, a point not lost on the\nmanagement development team:\nI wouldn't say that our managers weren't cynical about our values at first, of course they\nwere, but we have been careful to ensure that senior managers really do live the values we\npromote. Every year we undertake an employee attitude survey. This assesses different\naspects of our ability to live our values. For example, by looking at employee satisfaction in\nareas such as personal development and performance review we can identify whether\nmanagers are really taking an interest in their staff. At the moment we have had over 80 per\ncent of our performance reviews completed in the last year.\nThis survey was supported by a balanced scorecard monitoring process that ensured the\nintegration of people, operational, financial and customer strategies. Each quarter the process\nflags up where the company may be falling short on its objectives on a green-amber-red\nwarning basis. Such methods helped ensure that management development plans did not\nbecome disconnected from the business. Other processes that helped ensure the deployment\nof such management development were values workshops and 360-degree appraisal\nprocesses that encouraged managers to link their objectives to the key organization values.\nHowever, despite the success of this robust set of generic programmes RETAILCO was\nacutely aware of the danger of relying purely on these for future leadership growth and for\nthe need to supplement this approach with alternative processes. As a senior development\nmanager, Peter, explained:\nWe have to be on our guard against becoming too inward looking \u2026 in the future the critical\ncompetence we will need will be change management skills and a culture of continuous\nimprovement. The challenge is to create competency frameworks that are nimble enough to\nrespond to rapid change.\nFurthermore, inclusive programmes run the risk of not differentiating sufficiently between\nleadership and management. Such approaches need a robust set of selection processes to\nensure that the best rise to the top. If selection is only made on here-and-now assessments\nthrough performance appraisals, there is a danger of building a short-term focus into a BLD\nstrategy. Additional processes are therefore required to ensure that leadership attributes that\npromote a longer term and more challenging view are developed.\nWith this in mind, the RETAILCO \u201cAcademy\u201d was created which afforded more targeted\nand individualised approaches, as a vehicle for developing the next generation of RETAILCO\nleaders for who the challenge was to balance adherence to the \u201cRETAILCO Way\u201d with the\nneed for greater innovation. As Peter put it:\n\u2026 the company is now operating in nine countries outside of the UK and given the diversity\nof these business environments it is quite possible that we may need to get store managers to\nthink differently if they are to fulfil our ambition to create real value for our customers.\nAdopting a generic programmes approach is consistent with seeking to influence corporate\nculture through inclusive and corporately consistent development. Driven by a clearly\narticulated business need for a consistent high quality customer experience which is\nembedded in the value driven \u201cRETAILCO Way\u201d, RETAILCO used this approach extremely\neffectively. They also worked hard to ensure that senior management really did live the\nespoused values and had a real interest in listening to employees, thus trying to minimise the\ngap between senior management rhetoric and organizational reality. An undue emphasis on\ntargeting and tailoring would have undermined the establishment of that inclusive culture\nimplied by \u201ctreating others as we would like to be treated ourselves\u201d. The success of the\napproach was not only reflected in RETAILCO's performance but in their employee feedback\nand positive views about their meritocratic organizational culture. However, strong cultures\ncan become inward looking and complacent unless care is taken to inculcate a broader\nexternal business perspective. Similarly, the drive for inclusion can mean there is a danger\nthat leadership needs become undifferentiated from more general management development.\nRETAILCO proceeded to focus on these very issues, demonstrating the need for a critical\nview of the continuing relevance of any particular BLD approach in meeting the anticipated\nstrategic and business needs as they changed.\nEmerging themes\nThese cases were chosen to reflect very different approaches to BLD and illustrate how\ndifferent development strategies can align with different strategic, business and cultural\ncircumstances. Our case selection method would of course lead to some common features\nsuch as developing home-grown talent, the use of competency frameworks and so on, but\nbeyond these obvious points of similarity, what kind of \u201cgenerative mechanisms\u201d or causal\npowers do the case analyses surface that may help practitioners tackle the problems of\nachieving strategic relevance and enhancing the quality of HR\/development thinking? Five\nsubstantive themes appear to be significant, each reflecting the transformational impact of\nindividual agency in shaping the social processes and structures (Fairclough, 2005) of\neffective BLD.\nLinking BLD strategy to business need\nThe importance of aligning BLD activities to business needs is now taken for granted (Doyle,\n1995; Lee, 1996). Yet Phase One revealed that organizations did not find this easy to achieve\n(Clarke et al., 2004). Only 20 per cent of respondents were able to identify strategic drivers\nfor their organization's BLD approach. Lack of clarity about BLD purpose was frequently\nrevealed by the confusion about whether development should be for a targeted audience or\ninclusive of all managers and whether development content should be individually tailored or\ncorporately consistent, provoking simultaneous complaints of elitism or unfocussed activity.\nAnd some practitioners, applying multiple strategies, were not clear about how these related\nto one another or how together they aligned to their organization's business needs. Finally\nthere were frequent examples of practitioners confidently pursuing a development strategy in\none framework quadrant while line managers believed their focus should be in another.\nSignificantly, in the case organizations a critical causal mechanism appeared to be the clarity\nof individual agents about their business context (Schafer et al., 2001), the major strategic\nissue they were trying to address and therefore the choice of approach, which would prove to\nbe most relevant. For example, the HRD Director in SOFTCO recognised that given the scale\nof the change required in cross-functional working he needed to target his development\npopulation selectively but at the same time ensure that BLD content was consistent in order\nto achieve the critical mass required. In RETAILCO, similar insights were achieved; high\nlevels of targeting would undermine the declared values of inclusion. While in PARCELCO\ninappropriate levels of corporate consistency would detract from the autonomous business\nmodel. A good understanding of their business circumstances as well as current and critical\nstrategic imperatives thus enabled individual agents to make critical content and population\njudgements to ensure a high degree of relevance to their business circumstances and\naspirations.\nLinking development method to business need\nA key driver for leadership programmes is often the need to build a common approach and\nnetwork among senior managers (Kamoche, 2000). Combined with prescriptions to develop\nhome grown talent through action-learning, and a view that in-company programmes provide\na better fit with the development of strategic leaders (Conger and Benjamin, 1999) and that\npublic programmes tend to have little impact on a leader's ability to produce better results\n(Zenger et al., 2000), it is not surprising that internal programmes are popular.\nThese cases however highlight how some individuals are moderating such \u201ctaken for\ngranted\u201d assumptions and are not restricting themselves to such an internal or inclusive\napproach advice. Instead they are using agreed perceptions about business need as the\nrationale for the development approach. For example, in BANKCO senior management are\nusing external development activities for selected individuals to stimulate the development of\nan external perspective in an organization that had been traditionally inward looking. This\nsuggests that these selected managers are seen to have the potential personal influence to\nmodify existing social processes that encouraged BANKCO'S introspection. RETAILCO also\nrecognise the risks of developing an inward looking culture and their need to inculcate a\nbroader external perspective. However, in contrast to BANKCO, this organization\nemphasises the use of formal structures such as a leadership academy, competency\nframework, and vision and value statements to both reinforce and modify existing managerial\npractices. In PARCELCO the drive for local autonomy and entrepreneurial spirit meant that\ncorporate consistency was not essential and external development activities had a potential\nvalue in modifying existing structures by stimulating broader and innovative business\nthinking. The PARCELCO case is supportive of Mabey's (2002) finding that when\nresponsibility for development is given to individual managers there is a corresponding\nincrease in diverse development activity.\nClarity about the role of management development\nIn our initial survey although we found many MD practitioners who had great clarity about\nthe role of management development and how it aligned with different business drivers, these\nplans were often not well communicated to their internal customers, a point echoed about HR\nin general by Guest and King (2004). Consequently line managers tended to see a raft of\nseemingly unconnected development activities and were unsure how their own needs were\nbeing managed. This underlines the need for clarity about the vision for management\ndevelopment in addressing these issues and about how best to communicate this role.\nIn contrast to earlier criticisms of the ability of development practitioners to lead change\n(Mole, 1996; Thomson et al., 1997) it was apparent that in each of these cases, practitioners\nwere challenging existing definitions of the relevance and role of BLD. For example, Bill in\nSOFTCO was prepared to generate change from the following in the absence of senior\nmanagement appreciation of and investment in development. In BANKCO, Donal introduced\nsenior management competencies that challenged existing conceptions of leadership, and in\nRETAILCO, Peter and his colleagues are rethinking the future competencies of a more\ninternational RETAILCO.\nWith regard to communicating this role, in our cases this was done better than most, but still\nwith room for improvement. Processes varied from BANKCO's use of internal corporate\ncommunications via the internet and brochures, to Bill's very personal approach in SOFTCO.\nIn RETAILCO the balanced scorecard provided employees with information about how\nannual people development initiatives contributed to the overall business.\nA discriminating, strategically based approach to evaluation\nSurveys repeatedly report the inadequate assessment of development activities (Axel, 1999;\nThomson et al., 1997; Council for Excellence in Management and Leadership (CEML),\n2001). Lack of clear objectives and the difficulty of establishing quantifiable results have\nbeen cited as significant reasons (Cairns, 1997). In our cases the organizations evaluated the\nresults of their investment and overcame some of the reported problems, once again by taking\na more discriminating approach. In BANKCO the focus on creating a stock of high potential\nmanagers enabled the HRD team to evaluate their work through business-wide measures\nrelated to talent flows. In SOFTCO the significant measures were again a reflection of the\ndevelopment goals; perceived improvements in cross-functional working, pro-activity and\ncustomer service. The drive for corporate alignment in RETAILCO has led to a range of\nbusiness outcome measures such as attitude surveys and balanced scorecard evaluations. In\neach case, selecting measures appropriate to strategic intent surmounted the perennial\nproblem of evaluation. In turn, this differentiated approach forced and enabled better quality\nof thinking in those responsible for BLD.\nIndividual leadership in BLD\nThe Catch 22 situations that surround BLD in many organizations leave management\ndevelopment professionals trying to initiate BLD in extremely unfavourable circumstances.\nYet success in these case studies appeared to be closely related to one or more people taking\na substantive leadership role in the design and implementation of BLD. In particular, the\nillustrative examples reflect the importance of individual agency in influencing the\nestablishment of a strategic focus. This is supportive of other research (Murphy and Southey,\n2003) about the role of leadership in HR innovation, but suggests that agents can make\nprogress even when legitimate organizational support is lacking. For example, in SOFTCO,\nBLD itself was used to challenge dominant definitions of the way the organization worked.\nBill's vision, acknowledgement of different power bases and challenge were central to\novercoming the complex set of political and institutional barriers that beset the BLD arena.\nThis is supportive of Truss's (2001) observation of the criticality of informal processes in\nimplementing effective HRM and, Ogbonna and Whipp's (1999) view as to the inherently\npolitical nature of the connections between strategy and HR. The kind of leadership displayed\nin these cases provides an initial insight about how it is that individuals can make a difference\nto the effectiveness of BLD in the face of unfavourable circumstances. We illustrate this\ncritical area in detail in the companion paper (Clarke et al., 2008).\nPoints for reflection and action\nWe believe this analysis builds on current literature in several ways. In recent years there has\nbeen considerable debate about the relative value of; vertical and horizontal integration\nbetween business and HRM strategy; and the need for \u201cflexibility\u201d of response over time\n(Wright and Snell, 1998; Purcell, 1999; Gratton et al., 1999; Truss, 2001; Buyens and De\nVos, 2001). We believe the BLD Strategy Framework described here adds to this debate by\nproviding a conceptual tool that synthesises concerns for both fit and flexibility considered\ncritical by Wright and Snell (1998) and Purcell (1999). The bottom two quadrants being\nconcerned with organizational consistency explicitly address issues of vertical fit, while the\ntop two quadrants offer opportunities for flexibility in as much as they are designed to\nspecifically enhance behavioural repertoires that can provide organizations with options for\npursuing strategic alternatives (Wright and Snell, 1998, p. 761). Indeed this formed part of\nthe driving force behind the PARCELCO and BANKCO approaches.\nThe model can therefore be viewed as a tool to help ensure that BLD is concerned with\n\u201censuring fit among a subset of strategically relevant variables while simultaneously seeking\nto build generic organizational capabilities that can be applied toward both discovering and\nimplementing a variety of diverse strategic initiatives\u201d (Wright and Snell, 1998, p. 767). This\nis achieved by helping those responsible for BLD to discriminate between a bundle of\npractices (not a definite list) that highlight how, over time, BLD processes can be translated\ninto behaviours that suit the changing needs of an organization (Purcell, 1999). We argue\ntherefore that explicit recognition of different development populations; different sponsors,\ninterest groups and strategic timeframes will form the basis for a more informed discussion\nabout strategic alignment of BLD. This broadly allies with Delery and Doty's (1996)\n\u201cconfigurational\u201d approach to HR practice. While the Strategy Framework may understate\nthe real world complexity of organizational possibilities (Colbert, 2004) in only providing\nfour possible configurations of BLD, it is not our intention here to replicate all possibilities or\ncreate ideal types but to draw attention to some of the key variables to consider in\noperationalising BLD.\nIndeed, in Mabey's (2002) study, four key variables in UK management development practice\nare highlighted; the corporate context, the decisions made about development choices, the\ncontent and extent of the development activities and the qualitative value attached to the\ninvestment in management development. Although all four of these variables and the\nlinkages between them are reflected within our own five themes, the cases also reflect the\nimportance of informal activity, individual agency and politics in their execution (Truss,\n2001; Ogbonna and Whipp, 1999; Sheehan, 2005). The individual clarity, motivation and\nleadership of those championing BLD considerably moderated the effectiveness of the causal\nlinkages between business context, BLD strategy and execution. Indeed, it may well be this\nindividual orientation that enabled these organizations to work through the inevitable\nambiguities and contradictions of HRD policy (Ogbonna and Whipp, 1999; Guest and King,\n2004). By mobilising relationships, power resources and structures to challenge the\nenactment of BLD, agents were able to \u201ctransform\u201d the structures of BLD to achieve levels of\nBLD coherence.\nIn combination, the five themes explored here appear to generate a level of discriminative\nthinking that results in a differentiated approach to BLD. In each case this enabled the\norganization to overcome many of the issues of relevance, vision, power and quality\nidentified through the initial survey, particularly those of strategic relevance and quality of\nthinking. These themes and linkages therefore do not provide the complete answer, but do\nsurface a number of helpful themes for HR\/development professionals to consider. For\nexample, thinking more acutely about the relationship between business need\/context, target\npopulation and development method forces better quality thinking about BLD strategy. This\nclarity of intent can form the basis for challenging existing approaches and developing a more\neffective business role for BLD.\nThese insights suggest useful starting points for management development specialists and\nsenior managers in reviewing and improving the BLD strategy and practice in their own\norganizations.\n1. Are we clear about where our current BLD strategy sits in this matrix?\n2. Are we clear about which business conditions support that position?\n3. Are we therefore able to demonstrate a real payback to the business?\n4. Which set of factors (corporate consistency, individualisation, targeting, inclusion) is\nmost important for meeting current business needs?\n5. Do different business units\/activities\/levels\/management populations require different\napproaches\/development methods?\n6. How well are these plans communicated to the different management populations so\nthat they understand how their different needs are being managed?\n7. How will anticipated changes to the business influence the future positioning of our\napproach in this matrix?\nThe case studies were prompted by our earlier findings that exposed the extent to which BLD\nis a poorly understood activity, often disconnected from business needs and greatly under-\nutilised as a means of improving business performance. By definition, case studies provide a\nlimited sample and our intention here was to stimulate debate about effective processes of\nstrategic alignment rather than provide highly generalisable insights. However, what emerges\nfrom the analysis is the importance of developing a more discriminating approach to BLD \u2013\none that acknowledges the criticality of vision, business relevance, politics and quality\nthinking in ensuring a strategically integrated and effective approach.\nThis analysis also raises further questions. First, although part of a larger international\nsample, all the cases focussed on the UK context, albeit that three are part of international\ncorporations. Would effective approaches to alignment differ in a different cultural context?\nSecond, neither do the cases provide detailed evidence about the relative effectiveness of\ndifferent development methodologies. Are there any development methods that are more\nappropriate in different quadrants of the BLD strategy framework? Third, in contradiction to\n\u201cbest practice\u201d advice, organizations are successfully using both internal and external\nmethods of development, so what is the relative value of internal and external activities for\nBLD? Fourth, one of the most significant barriers to a coherent strategic approach to BLD\nidentified through our research was the lack of a meaningful senior management vision for\nBLD. Perhaps one of the most important questions that needs to be researched is how senior\nmanagement view the relative value of leadership and therefore business leadership\ndevelopment against other potential drivers of business performance improvement such as\nbrand, product development or culture. Until greater certainty about these relationships can\nbe obtained, widespread progress on the impact of BLD may be limited. As long as this is the\ncase, as practitioners we are forced to ask how individuals leading BLD can really make a\ndifference now? This question is the focus for the companion paper (Clarke et al., 2008).\nReferences\nAckroyd, S., Fleetwood, S.
