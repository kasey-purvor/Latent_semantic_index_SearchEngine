For example,\nsuch assistance may include providing exercises of appropriate difficulty and content, and\nselecting suitable learning material according to the learner\u2019s current learning needs.\nTraditionally an ITS contains three models. The domain model is a representation of\nthe domain (e.g. concepts, relationships between concepts, prerequisite relationships). The\ndomain model allows the system to generate and understand the content it is teaching, and\nevaluate the accuracy of the user\u2019s input. The learner model is a model of the individual\u2019s\ncurrent understanding of the domain, constructed based on interactions between the user and\nsystem, such as material viewed, time spent on material and, in particular, responses to ques-\ntions or attempts at problem-solving. A learner model is therefore a representation of the\nlearner\u2019s knowledge (including skills, competences and problematic issues), and is dynam-\nically updated \u2013 i.e. it is a model of current knowledge, not an overall performance score or\nsummary. The pedagogical model is a model of teaching knowledge or strategies. Teaching\nstrategies allow an ITS to individualise its teaching: the system interprets the user\u2019s knowl-\nedge from their learner model, comparing this to the domain model, and then makes a vari-\nety of teaching or guidance decisions such as choice of topic, level of detail of information\nor explanations to present, method of presentation of information or explanations and gener-\nation or selection of appropriate exercises. ITSs are being developed for a range of domains,\nfrom mathematics (Melis, Haywood, and Smith 2006) to astronaut training (Dubois,\nNkambou, and Hohmeyer 2006) to music (Lahart 2005).\nIn this paper we focus on the learner model, and the specific case of open learner models\n(OLMs). There is an increasing trend towards opening the learner model to the learner \u2013 i.e.\n*Corresponding author. Email: s.bull@bham.ac.uk\n124  I. Gakhal and S. Bull\nexternalising the model so that it is both visible and interpretable by the user. Examples\ninclude OLMs for computing subjects such as programming (Brusilovsky and Sosnovsky\n2005) and databases (Mitrovic and Martin 2007); technical terminology (Dimitrova, Brna,\nand Self 2002); and foreign language learning (Bull and Nghiem 2002). OLMs can be\nsimple in format \u2013 e.g. skill meters giving a high level overview of knowledge (Mitrovic\nand Martin 2007); or complex \u2013 e.g. conceptual graphs (Dimitrova, Brna, and Self 2002)\nand hierarchical tree structures (Kay 1997). By externalising the model a number of benefits\ncan be achieved, including use of the OLM to raise learner awareness of their current\nknowledge state, to help the student plan and reflect upon their learning, and to allow them\ngreater control and responsibility for their learning through identification of their learning\nneeds. OLMs can therefore help users to set personal goals, plan ways to achieve these\ngoals, and monitor their progress towards these goals (Kay 1997).\nPositive results have been found for users inspecting even a simple learner model using\nthe OLMlets OLM deployed in a range of university courses in electronic, electrical and\ncomputer engineering (Bull, Quigley, and Mabbott 2006). The OLMlets study was with\nusers mostly taking compulsory courses. In such cases students are likely to have varying\nlevels of motivation. Given the positive results amongst such students, we wish to investi-\ngate the potential for simple OLMs to support learning amongst different types of learner.\nHere we consider the case of highly motivated independent learners, using the example of\ntrainee pilots studying for their Private Pilot\u2019s Licence. While we acknowledge that not all\ntrainee pilots will complete a course, and private pilot trainees may be less motivated than\nthose on more advanced pilot courses (Frederick-Recascino and Hall 2003), it seems likely\nthat trainees who choose to continue at a flight school will be at least as motivated to\nsucceed as students in other learning contexts. (As will be seen in the next section, trainees\nare likely to be intrinsically motivated learners \u2013 see Ryan and Deci 2000 \u2013 whereas\nstudents may be externally motivated, for example if they perceive their degree as a neces-\nsary step towards their chosen career.) Our first question, then, concerns whether results\nfor use of an OLM with typical university engineering students are also applicable to\nintrinsically motivated independent learners.\nA second line of investigation concerns the method of presentation of the learner model.\nUse of OLMlets revealed that, of the five simple OLM views available, \u2018skill meters\u2019 \u2013 part\nshaded bars to represent knowledge levels of the various topics \u2013 were the most frequently\nused (Bull and Mabbott 2006). Skill meters are also the most common form of simple OLM.\nNevertheless, in OLMlets, even though skill meters were the most frequently used OLM\nview, not all students used the skill meters and some used these in combination with\nother presentations of their learner model. It was therefore recommended that alternative\npresentations should be considered in the design of OLMs to accommodate individual pref-\nerences. In this paper a new alternative format of learner model presentation is introduced\nfor use alongside skill meters in order to extend previous work on presentation preferences\nfor OLMs. In our second question we seek, therefore, to discover whether a different OLM\npresentation may be found useful by some students.\nWe also investigate users\u2019 use of their OLM as a support for planning over time. Skill\nmeters and equivalent learner model views allow learners to monitor their changing knowl-\nedge and plan their learning in the short term as they show a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of knowledge. A\nthird model view is also available in our system, which is solely concerned with aiding\nlonger-term planning \u2013 hypothesised to be particularly useful to the learning context of the\ntrainee pilots who are working independently. Our third question therefore asks whether\nindependent learners use the more common \u2018snapshot\u2019 OLM or a longer-term planning aid\n(or both).\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   125\nResearch in open learner modelling is still in the early stages. There are therefore very\nmany questions remaining to be investigated, relating to a broad range of issues including\nlearning gains, learner model presentation preferences, what students use OLMs for, what\ninformation they attend to, how OLMs may support collaborative interaction, why some\nstudents do not access their OLM, use of OLMs over time, use of OLMs in different courses\nand the utility of OLMs for different types of user. (See Bull, Dimitrova, and McCalla (2007)\nfor further discussion of research questions.) Using the \u2018Flight Club\u2019 OLM, this paper\nconsiders just some of the early questions. We investigate whether previous work on the use\nof simple OLMs is also relevant to motivated, independent learners \u2013 i.e. we aim to find out\nwhether this type of OLM approach might also be of benefit to the kind of learners who have\na high drive to succeed, and who may already have successful learning strategies in place.\nOur results with trainee pilots may generalise to other motivated learners, such as intrinsi-\ncally motivated students who find themselves with little in common with extrinsically\nmotivated students who may dominate their course. The results may also be relevant to\ndistance learners who, like trainee pilots, tend to be older and more mature (Tucker n.d.).\nIn summary, we consider (i) whether our trainees inspect their learner model; (ii) which\nlearner model presentations are found useful; and (iii) use of the open learner model as a\nshort-term versus long-term planning aid.\n\u2018Flight Club\u2019 users and the learning context\nFlight Club is targeted at trainee pilots working towards their Private Pilot\u2019s Licence (PPL).\nThis licence comprises a course of practical training and a series of seven ground examina-\ntions, set in accordance with the Joint Aviation Regulations (JAR) syllabus (Campbell\n2005). Flight Club is designed to aid the user in learning the material for each of the ground\nexaminations by helping them become more aware of their knowledge state, and providing\ninformation to help them set personal targets.\nIdeally, of course, in an educational setting the complete learning context would be\nconsidered, incorporating an understanding of how technology can support learning taking\naccount of psychological processes of learning and wider environmental features, then\ndeveloping appropriate instructional strategies to encourage learning (Alavi and Leidner\n2001). In our setting this would involve a synergy of understanding about the learner\u2019s theo-\nretical knowledge and any difficulties through learner modelling, and the interaction\nbetween these data and what is being undertaken in the practical flight hours. However, PPL\ntrainees receive no formal instruction for ground examinations, with the emphasis being on\nindependent learning; and there is no direct correspondence between what trainees might be\ndoing during their practical training, and the stage they have reached in their ground exam-\ninations. An OLM approach of raising learner awareness of their knowledge and potential\ndifficulties therefore appears to be an especially useful way to support learning in this\ncontext. Successful use of an OLM in this situation would suggest the potential for OLMs\nto support independent learning more generally.\nThe \u2018Flight Club\u2019 system\nTrainees may consult information based on the JAR syllabus available in Flight Club, or\nconsult the standard materials \u2013 either while using the environment or after having identi-\nfied their needs through questioning by the system. Questions are presented in multiple-\nchoice format. There are two main reasons for this: (i) multiple choice questions can be\ndesigned to elicit known common difficulties; and (ii) the JAR PPL examinations comprise\n126  I. Gakhal and S. Bull\nmultiple choice questions, so Flight Club questions match the format of the examination\ntowards which users are working. Flight Club uses the responses to construct a model of the\nlearner\u2019s knowledge level, areas of difficulty and specific misconceptions. Knowledge level\nis identified by referring to the system\u2019s representation of the expert domain knowledge;\nmisconceptions are identified by comparing the learner\u2019s input to a misconceptions library;\nand general difficulties are identified by learner \u2018knowledge\u2019 that neither matches informa-\ntion in the domain model nor the misconceptions library \u2013 i.e. these are things that the\nlearner does not yet know, but about which they do not have a specific misconception.\nFlight Club is not a full ITS \u2013 it is primarily concerned with questioning the learner,\nmodelling their knowledge and presenting the learner model to the learner. The adaptivity\nof the system is therefore focused around open learner modelling rather than, for example,\nadapting the content or explanations to the user. Kay (1997) argues that giving learners\nresponsibility for their learning can enhance the effectiveness of learning. This also concurs\nwith the aim of promoting learner autonomy and formative assessment through use of an\nOLM (Bull, Quigley, and Mabbott 2006). The aim of Flight Club is therefore to help inde-\npendent learners identify what they need to do, either using external materials or (non-\nadaptive) materials in the system. Thus Flight Club facilitates identification of learning\nneeds by showing learners representations of their understanding in their learner model, but\nat the same time allowing the learner to retain control and responsibility over the decisions\nregarding their learning \u2013 appropriate for advanced, motivated adult learners.\nThe \u2018Flight Club\u2019 open learner model\nBecause Flight Club users are learning independently, with no teaching support, a simple\nlearner model presentation was chosen for the initial evaluation. The OLM can be viewed\nin three forms: skill meters, aircraft positioning and runway schedule.\nSkill meters represent user knowledge as a subset of the system\u2019s expert knowledge,\nwith green (shaded medium grey in Figure 1) to portray the proportion of the user\u2019s knowl-\nedge in relation to full knowledge. For example, Figure 1 shows examples of both when a\nuser currently understands 50% of a topic as inferred from their most recent responses (Air\nLaw), and also when they have a weaker understanding of the subject (Meteorology). The\nlighter grey area represents unknown or currently problematic issues. Red (shaded dark in\nFigure 1) indicates the existence of one or more misconceptions in a topic. The skill meter\nbecomes \u2018overridden\u2019, turning red (Human Performance), in order to focus the user\u2019s efforts\nonto resolving the problem. This is because trainees are required to prepare for ground\nexaminations whilst concurrently conducting practical training \u2013 a misconception could be\ndangerous if applied in a real situation.\nFigure 1. Example of Flight Club\u2019s skill meters.When a misconception has been identified, a button appears allowing the user to view\nthe misconception. A brief description of the misconception is displayed (Figure 2), in\nFigure 1. Example of Flight Club\u2019s skill meters.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   127\naccordance with previous results with university students who consulted descriptions of\ntheir misconceptions when these were provided (Bull, Quigley, and Mabbott 2006). The\ncorrect concepts and information are available for consultation in Flight Club\u2019s learning\nmaterials.\nFigure 2. Example of misconception description.The second way of viewing the learner model is through the aircraft positioning presen-\ntation (Figure 3). This view includes the same information as the skill meters, but portrayed\nin a different manner.\nFigure 3. The aircraft positioning learner model view.Similar to the skill meters, the user is made aware of the proportion of their knowledge\nas a subset of the topic. This is achieved through a pictured aircraft taking off from a\nrunway. As knowledge increases, additional aircraft appear, with an aircraft in the top left\ncorner representing expert knowledge (i.e. where the knowledge of the user is equal to the\nsystem\u2019s representation of the topic). In contrast to the skill meter, here knowledge of only\none topic is displayed on the screen.\nThe existence of misconceptions is indicated by the dial in Figure 4, based on a cockpit\ninstrument (bottom left of the screen in Figure 3). When a misconception is identified, the\nneedle moves into the red area at the bottom of the dial. As with the skill meters, the iden-\ntification of a misconception causes the representation of knowledge level to be overridden\nwith all aircraft disappearing from the screen, to direct the user\u2019s attention towards resolving\nthe misconception. Learners view their misconception description in the same form as for\nthe skill meters (Figure 2).\nFigure 4. The aircraft positioning view presenting a misconception.The two learner model views described above are primarily concerned with helping\nlearners identify their current knowledge and difficulties, thereby facilitating self-monitor-\ning and immediate planning through allowing them to compare their knowledge level\nagainst the system\u2019s expert knowledge, and making them aware of any misconceptions. The\nthird view, runway schedule (Figure 5), aims to help users plan their learning over a longer\nperiod. Users provide information on the date of their examination to allow the system to\ncalculate a number of benchmarks as appropriate for the particular examination, at dates up\nuntil the examination.\nFigure 5. The runway schedule view.Runways start unfilled, and as the system\u2019s representation of the user\u2019s knowledge\nincreases, the runway slowly fills (unfilled portion(s) represent a gap in user knowledge).\nIf the user does not fill the runway to the benchmark point by the date shown, they are\nalerted that they may have difficulty passing their examination. Should the learner\u2019s\nprogress be faster or slower than planned, the schedule and benchmarks can be recalcu-\nlated so that a learner\u2019s different constraints at various times during their study can be\naccounted for.\nEvaluation\nThis section describes the initial evaluation of Flight Club deployed in a UK flight school.\nOur purpose was to build upon the results of a simple OLM used by university students\nFigure 2.

The aircraft positioning view presenting a misconception.\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   129\nstudying in traditional face-to-face courses (Bull, Quigley, and Mabbott 2006), investigating\nthe potential for a simple OLM for highly motivated, independent learners. As Flight Club\ndoes not provide adaptive teaching and given that a main aim is to prompt studying away\nfrom the system, we do not attempt to measure learning gains during use of Flight Club.\nInstead, we investigate the issues raised previously: whether trainees choose to use a simple\nOLM; the learner model views they use; the purpose for which they use the views; and the\nperceived utility of the OLM as a learning aid.\nParticipants, materials and methods\nFlight Club was installed on a computer at the participating flight school, for a four-week\nperiod. All current trainees were invited to try the system, though usage was voluntary. All\n16 PPL trainees used Flight Club. As the JAR PLL assessment consists of seven examina-\ntions taken at different dates, the participants used the system in accordance with the exam-\nination they were working towards. Use was unconstrained and unsupervised, and at the\ntime and frequency of the user\u2019s choosing.\nAll interactions were logged, and the learner models were available for analysis.\nParticipants completed a questionnaire, addressing issues relating to the features of each\nlearner model view. Responses were on a five-point scale indicating the extent of agreement\nwith a statement of the utility of a feature.\nResults\nThe logs reveal that the majority of users viewed their OLM using more than one presenta-\ntion. A breakdown of usage levels and learner model presentations accessed by each user is\nshown in Table 1. All users viewed each presentation while becoming acquainted with the\nsystem. These first viewings are not included \u2013 i.e. the results relate to viewings that took\nplace during learning interactions.\nTen of the 16 trainees used Flight Club on a single occasion, with six using it multiple\ntimes. Individuals answered between 29 and 109 questions (mean 65.75; median 73.5).\nFigure 5. The runway schedule view.\n130  I. Gakhal and S. Bull\nThe skill meters and aircraft positioning views are equivalent in content. Five users used\nboth; nine used only one (with a near-equal split). Amongst those who used each of the\nviews, usage of the aircraft positioning view tended to be higher (mean 4.2; median 4) than\nuse of the skill meters (mean 3.33; median 3). Eleven users used the runway schedule (mean\nnumber of accesses 5.36; median 5), and all but one of the six trainees who used the system\nmultiple times accessed this longer-term planning aid.\nTable 2 details the identification and viewing of misconceptions, and access to learning\nmaterials, as recorded in the system logs.\nFive users had misconceptions at some point. Each of these accessed the misconception\ndescriptions. Only three of the 16 users consulted the learning materials.\nTables 3, 4 and 5 show the number of users who found each of the presentations useful\nin providing a specific benefit associated with the OLM, obtained from the questionnaire data.\nMost users found the skill meters and aircraft positioning views helpful for identifying\ntheir difficulties; most also found the skill meters useful for identifying misconceptions,\nwhile only five found the aircraft positioning view helpful for this purpose. The aircraft\npositioning view was also found useful for identifying or quantifying knowledge level. Only\nTable 1.

A minority found the skill meters\nand aircraft positioning useful as a planning aid. In contrast, all found the runway schedule\nuseful as a means to aid the planning of their learning. (The runway schedule was not\ndesigned to address the other features, and accordingly was not found to be helpful for those\npurposes, by most users.)\nFifteen of the 16 users stated that they found the runway schedule useful in general; 13\nfound the aircraft positioning view useful; and two users considered the skill meters to be\ngenerally helpful.\nDiscussion\nIn this section we discuss the results with reference to our three main questions from the\nintroduction: \n(1) Will trainee pilots use an OLM?\n(2) Which learner model presentations will be found most useful?\n(3) Will trainees use the OLM as a short-term or longer-term planning aid?\nWe then consider the relevance of our findings with this population, for other learners.\nTable 5.

Gakhal and S. Bull\nWill trainee pilots use an OLM?\nOur first question relating to whether trainees will use an OLM necessarily includes use of\nthe environment as a whole, since the OLM is the mechanism through which users obtain\nfeedback on their understanding, modelled according to their interaction. This can be\naddressed by looking at the usage statistics. All current PPL trainees were invited to try\nFlight Club, but given the context of learning and the target users, usage was voluntary.\nNevertheless, all used the system, and it is unlikely that the usage levels would have been\nmaintained if trainees had not perceived some benefit to their exam preparation.\nDepending on their stage of learning and preferred learning patterns, learners may find\nit more or less useful to return to Flight Club over the four-week period. We therefore do\nnot consider frequency of login as necessarily indicative of the general utility. Ten users\nused the system on a single occasion, with the remainder using it between two and four\ntimes. Those who used it multiple times will likely have returned because it was helpful,\nand because they felt there was further need to identify what to study for their exam. Given\nthe extent of interaction also in the single sessions, it is likely that many of these users also\nfound it useful to help them identify where to focus their study.\nOnly three participants viewed the learning materials. Considering the general usage\nlevels, this suggests that most were using the OLM as intended \u2013 to identify where they\nneeded to invest further effort; and most were choosing to follow this up outside the system.\nNevertheless, the fact that some users did use the materials suggests the utility of including\nthese for users who wish to consult information immediately upon encountering a problem\nor a gap in their knowledge.\nWe would not expect an OLM such as that presented here to be a preferred source of\ninformation or practice for all trainees. Our aim is to offer an environment for those who\nfind it useful, to help them identify their learning needs and plan their learning accordingly.\nIt appears that some learners working in a highly independent learning context will indeed\nuse a simple OLM to support their learning, and this may make the provision of an OLM\nworthwhile.\nWhich learner model presentations will be found useful?\nOne of the aims of this study was to build upon previous work (Bull and Mabbott 2006)\nwhere the most common form of simple OLM, the skill meter, was used more frequently\nthan four alternatives with equivalent information. Our second question addresses this.\nUsing Flight Club we investigated whether users preferred to review their knowledge during\ntheir interaction using the skill meters or an equivalent alternative, aircraft positioning. In\nterms of overall usefulness, only two users agreed with the statement that the skill meters\nwere useful, whereas 13 agreed that the aircraft positioning presentation was useful. This\nis supported by the logs which identified more viewings of the aircraft positioning view.\nFinding that the skill meters were not used more than the aircraft positioning presentation\nis in contrast to the results of Bull and Mabbott (2006), but coheres with the findings of\nMabbott and Bull (2004), where participants had preferences for a variety of learner model\nviews. In the study of Mabbott and Bull, complex learner model presentations were\nprovided (e.g. concept map, prerequisites structure, hierarchical trees). Our results now\nsuggest the same might be true in some contexts in which learner model information is\npresented in a very simple format. Certainly it suggests that skill meters may not always be\nthe preferred simple learner model presentation. This result may be due to the specific alter-\nnative view chosen for Flight Club (aircraft positioning), the fact that it focused on a single\ntopic, or the different type of user. Whatever the reason, at this stage our contrasting results\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   133\nwith OLMlets and Flight Club strengthen the recommendation of providing alternative\nlearner model views even when simple presentations are used. This is further supported by\nthe fact that five users in this study consulted both views. Furthermore, although the two\nviews were designed to carry the same information, it seems that users were using them for\ndifferent purposes. Both were considered useful for identifying difficulties. However, only\nthe skill meters were generally considered useful as a means to raise awareness of the exist-\nence of misconceptions; and only the aircraft positioning view was generally found useful\nto identify level of knowledge. The overall preference for the aircraft positioning view,\ndespite the fact that the skill meters were considered better for highlighting the existence of\nmisconceptions, may be because only five users had misconceptions. With more fine-\ngrained learner modelling, or in a subject with typical entrenched misconceptions, or with\nlearners of lower ability and\/or motivation, use of the skill meters might be higher relative\nto other views, as found by Bull and Mabbott (2006). Therefore, as suggested above, further\nresearch should be undertaken as learners may be more likely to use an OLM if it is\npresented in a format that they prefer.\nWill trainee pilots use an OLM as a short-term or longer-term planning aid?\nOur third question regarding use of the OLM as a short-term versus longer-term planning\naid can be addressed by comparing use of the skill meters and aircraft positioning views,\nwith the runway schedule. In the runway schedule, focus is primarily on aiding users in plan-\nning and monitoring learning over time, rather than raising awareness of their current knowl-\nedge. As with the other views, the runway schedule was also used by the majority of\nparticipants. While finding the skill meters and aircraft positioning views useful for identi-\nfying knowledge, difficulties and misconceptions, users were less concerned with short-term\nplanning. It would be interesting to find out what users were doing with the information about\ntheir knowledge state if it was not to aid immediate planning \u2013 were they simply not thinking\nexplicitly about planning, or was the decision of what to do so straightforward for them upon\nviewing their learner model, that they did not consider it to be planning? Whatever the answer,\nusage suggests that trainees do appear to perceive some immediate benefit to using the OLM.\nHowever, it seems clearer that trainees find it helpful to use an OLM for planning longer\nterm \u2013 a less common application of open learner modelling.\nFuture directions\nGiven that all trainees voluntarily used Flight Club independently, it would be worth inves-\ntigating further questions with this type of user. The sample of 16 was sufficient to identify\ninterest in and use of the OLM \u2013 differences in use in a small sample can illustrate a need\nto take individual differences into account. Nevertheless, a larger sample would allow us to\nconfirm our results and investigate the purposes for which users were accessing the different\nviews more fully. We could investigate the extent of the use of the learner model view\ndesigned to aid planning over time, and whether this reflects the needs of this group who\nare studying independently for exams. Would similar results be found for distance learners\nwho, despite the additional academic support recommended for distance learners (see\ne.g. Clarke 2000; Miller and Husmann 1996), will still be undertaking much independent\nwork? Perhaps more interestingly, might this type of learning support also be helpful for\nthose taking part in face-to-face courses, to guide their private study? Work with OLMlets\nhas already suggested this to be the case for university students (Bull, Quigley, and Mabbott\n2006). From the Flight Club results it would appear that an OLM approach is also suitable\n134  I. Gakhal and S. Bull\nfor particularly motivated learners, and so could perhaps be used by such students in other\ncontexts (such as university courses) to help push them further in their study (e.g. to help\nthem extend their learning beyond that of the rest of the group). Might this approach also\nsupport students who are in danger of \u2018getting lost\u2019 as others progress? Access to represen-\ntations of their understanding might help such students identify their needs prior to an\nassessment. Of course, the underlying problem of a general lack of motivation for indepen-\ndent study is not addressed by this, but an OLM could help learners to get back on track\nwhen they most urgently need to, by helping them to prioritise their efforts.\nMany issues remain for investigation. Here we have suggested the utility of a simple\nOLM for motivated learners for both immediate and longer-term planning. We have also\nfound that our users do not have the same preference for learner model views as indicated\nin previous work. This demands further research in this area.\nConclusions\nThis paper has presented Flight Club, a simple OLM to aid immediate and longer-term plan-\nning by motivated, independent learners: trainee pilots studying for their Private Pilot\u2019s\nLicence. All trainees used the system, finding the learner model views useful for different\npurposes: identifying knowledge levels, difficulties and misconceptions, and planning over\ntime. Users had different preferences regarding the model views designed to raise their\nawareness of their understanding, suggesting the utility of allowing a choice of format for\naccessing learner model contents.\nGiven usage amongst learners who had no additional support for learning, we suggest\nthat OLMs could be a helpful aid in similarly \u2018unfavourable\u2019 learning conditions. We also\nconsider that OLMs might be usefully integrated into more supportive environments where\nlearners are learning independently, such as distance learning courses. Furthermore, if\nOLMs can be helpful for these situations, they may also be able to help the more traditional\nmotivated student to push themselves further, when studying amongst a group who are\ngenerally less motivated.\nReferences\nAlavi, M., and D.E.
