INTRODUCTION 1 \n 2 \nIntensively-farmed grasslands pose a number of concerns for river water quality which have 3 \nbeen highlighted by Hooda et al. (2000). These concerns arise from intensification of 4 \nlivestock production with associated increases in stocking density, demand for fodder and the 5 \nneed to manage and dispose of animal wastes such as farmyard manure, slurry, dirty water 6 \nand silage effluent. The quantity of farmyard manure and slurry produced annually from beef 7 \nand dairy cattle in the UK amounts to about 73 million tonnes (Smith et al., 2001), with 8 \nroughly 45% being applied to grassland (Smith et al., 1998). While this can be a valuable 9 \nsource of crop nutrients and organic matter necessary to maintain soil fertility and structure, it 10 \nalso needs careful management in terms of its storage and application to land in order to 11 \nprevent diffuse pollution either directly from farmyards and hard standings, or more indirectly 12 \nfollowing spreading. 13 \n 14 \nOn average cattle slurry contains roughly 6% dry matter, 3 kg N m-3, 0.5 kg P m-3 and 15 \n3 kg K m-3 and has a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 10,000-20,000 mgL-1 i.e. about 16 \n50 times greater than the BOD of untreated domestic sewage (Hooda et al., 2000; Defra, 17 \n2009). While there is guidance as to best practice for both the management and spreading of 18 \nslurry (Defra, 2001a; 2001b; 2009), the timing and rates of application are often determined 19 \nby storage and weather considerations. Leakage of farmyard stores, drainage from hard 20 \nstandings, and runoff following slurry application to land can all lead directly to losses of 21 \norganic matter, nutrients and pathogenic micro-organisms, with potential consequences for 22 \nboth stream ecology and human health. Losses from land have been variously attributed to 23 \nstorm events immediately following slurry spreading, surface application of slurry in winter, 24 \nand the role of under-drainage in heavy clay soils (Withers et al., 2003). These diffuse losses 25 \n 4\nhave mainly been characterised in terms of nutrients (e.g. Misselbrook et al., 1995; 1 \nHeathwaite et al, 1998; Vadas et al., 2007), although attention has recently turned to 2 \npathogenic micro-organisms (e.g. Oliver et al., 2005; Kay et al., 2008). However, the link 3 \nbetween slurry amendment and nutrient losses is, at least in part, circumstantial and tracing 4 \ntechniques are required to substantiate this link and provide an improved understanding of the 5 \nkey pathways and their controls (Granger et al., 2007).  6 \n 7 \nOne potential way forward is through the use of natural fluorescence. Recent advances in 8 \nfluorescence spectroscopy have enabled rapid automated collection of fluorescence intensity 9 \ndata across wide ranges of excitation and emission wavelengths. This technological 10 \ndevelopment has led to the widespread use of fluorescence to characterise dissolved organic 11 \nmatter (DOM) in water. An excellent review is provided by Hudson et al. (2007). In river 12 \nwater samples, both protein-like (tyrosine- and tryptophan-like) and fulvic-like and humic-13 \nlike fluorescence have been detected. The relative strength of these signals has been used to 14 \nindicate the presence of different sources of DOM and the extent of contamination by sewage 15 \nor other effluent (e.g. Baker, 2001; Baker and Inverarity, 2004; Galapate et al., 1998; 16 \nReynolds and Ahmad, 1997). Baker (2002) has also shown that animal wastes not only have 17 \nvery high protein-like fluorescence but also very high ratios of protein-like to fulvic\/humic-18 \nlike fluorescence compared to stream waters. The signal is similar to that from human sewage 19 \n(Henderson et al., 2009), so other tracers (e.g. boron; Jarvie et al., 2006) would need to be 20 \nused in conjunction with fluorescence to separate out agricultural from sewage or septic tank 21 \nsources. However, in the context of purely agricultural headwaters, there is considerable 22 \npotential for exploring natural fluorescence as a tracer for agricultural pollution in the liquid 23 \nphase from both hard standings and following slurry application to land and, thus, reinforce 24 \nthe existence of a direct link between agricultural amendments and nutrient export.  25 \n 5\n 1 \nThe purpose of this paper is to (i) demonstrate the use of natural fluorescence as an indicator 2 \nof diffuse slurry loss, in the liquid phase, following application to land and (ii) assess the 3 \nprospects for its use in quantifying such losses. 4 \n 5 \n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 6 \n 7 \nThis assessment of the use of natural fluorescence to trace slurry losses, following application 8 \nto land, was carried out by field experiment on the Rowden Experimental Research Platform 9 \n(RERP) at North Wyke Research, Devon, UK during autumn 2007. The data from this 10 \nexperiment were supplemented by analysis of nine different slurries sampled from dairy farms 11 \nacross Devon in June 2007 and of drainage waters from the nearby catchment of Den Brook 12 \nduring January 2007. 13 \n 14 \n2.1 Description of the field experiment 15 \nThe Rowden Experimental Research Platform (Figure 1) was established in 1982 on old 16 \nunimproved pasture on poorly drained sloping land (5-10%). Full details are provided in 17 \nArmstrong and Garwood (1991), Scholefield et al. (1993) and Bilotta et al. (2008). The site 18 \nconsists of fourteen plot-scale lysimeters which are approximately one hectare in size. The 19 \nsoil type is a clayey non-calcareous pelostagnogley of the Hallsworth Series (Findlay et al., 20 \n1984) which overlies the clay shales of the Crackington Formation and is typical of much of 21 \nthe permanent grassland in the south-west of England (Haygarth et al., 1998). At a depth of 22 \n30 cm, there is an impermeable clay horizon that prevents water from percolating downwards. 23 \nThe lysimeters are hydrologically isolated from their neighbours by gravel-filled ditches to 30 24 \ncm and at their upslope boundaries by deep interceptor drains. Half of the lysimeters are 25 \n 6\ndrained, with mole drains at 2 m spacing to a depth of 55 cm. The mole drains cross 1 \npermanent pipe drains (>100 mm diameter) at 40 m spacing and a depth of 85 cm, with 2 \npermeable backfill to within 30 cm of the surface. The lysimeters are managed as intensive 3 \ngrassland with annual applications of NPK fertiliser in line with the Code of Good 4 \nAgricultural Practice (Defra, 2009). They are grazed by beef cattle between June and October, 5 \nwith an average stocking density of four livestock units per hectare, to give a sward height of 6 \nbetween 8 and 10 cm. Each lysimeter has had a slightly different management history, in 7 \nterms of liming, fertiliser application and re-seeding, since its inception.  8 \n 9 \nInsert Figure 1 here 10 \n 11 \nSurface flow and throughflow from both the undrained and drained lysimeters is collected in 12 \ngravel-filled ditches installed at 30 cm depth at the lower lysimeter boundary. This flow then 13 \npasses over a standard 45\u02da V-notch weir (BSI, 1981). The drained lysimeters have a second 14 \nV-notch weir which is used to monitor the flow from the subsurface mole drains and pipe 15 \ndrainage network. Stage is recorded at 1 minute intervals by Starlevel sensors (Unidata, 16 \nO\u2019Connor, WA, Australia) connected to Campbell dataloggers (Model CR215, Campbell 17 \nScientific, Loughborough, UK). Rating curves were developed for the weirs by field 18 \nexperiment during July 2006. Full details are given in Krueger et al. (in press). Rainfall was 19 \nmeasured hourly by tipping bucket rain gauge connected to an automatic weather station. 20 \n 21 \nTwelve of the lysimeters were used in the experiment. Six lysimeters (three drained and three 22 \nundrained) were selected for slurry application as shown in Figure 1. Slurry was sourced from 23 \na nearby dairy farm where it had been stored in an open-air lagoon. It was applied at a rate of 24 \n46 m3 ha-1 between 11 and 13 October 2007 using a trailing-shoe spreader which applied the 25 \n 7\nslurry directly to the soil surface. A 5 m buffer zone was left around the perimeter of the 1 \nlysimeters to avoid any transfer of material directly into the collection ditches. Grab sampling 2 \nof the drainage water from the twelve lysimeters was undertaken every two hours during 3 \nstorm events. Two storm events were sampled. The first storm event was a relatively small 4 \nevent with 11.6 mm rainfall on 16-17 October 2007, which occurred immediately after 5 \nspreading. This was only the third storm of the autumn with over 10 mm rainfall and, as 6 \nindicated by the small and varied flow response, the lysimeters were in different states of 7 \nwetness prior to this event. The second storm event sampled was a more substantial double 8 \nstorm totalling 42.0 mm (16.4 mm plus 25.6 mm) rainfall some five weeks later on 18-22 9 \nNovember 2007. The intervening period had been relatively dry with only 23.4 mm rainfall 10 \nspread over several small events, all less than 5.6 mm.  11 \n 12 \nIn setting up the experiment, we were aware of potential changes over time in the 13 \nfluorescence signal from the applied slurry. These may be a result of microbial activity, 14 \nphotodegradation, oxidation, mineralization and preferential adsorption (Baker, 2002; Ohno 15 \nand Bro, 2006; Hunt and Ohno, 2007; Ohno et al., 2007). In order to track these temporal 16 \nchanges, the slurry was also applied to a compartmented tray of sterile medium (vermiculite) 17 \nat the same rate as to the lysimeters. The use of a sterile medium was chosen in order not to 18 \nintroduce additional sources of fluorescence. There was no attempt to simulate soil processes. 19 \nThe trays were located in the field adjacent to the lysimeters. Sub-samples were taken from 20 \nthe trays on a weekly basis using four replicates and two no-slurry controls. 21 \n 22 \n2.2 Laboratory methods 23 \nSamples of drainage waters and slurry were collected in acid-washed brown glass bottles and 24 \nkept cool. Slurry samples were gently mixed by inversion of the bottles before taking 0.5 g 25 \n 8\nslurry which was then made up to 50 ml with Milli-Q water. The sub-samples from the tray 1 \nexperiment were individually bagged in the field and, once received in the laboratory, 200ml 2 \nMilli-Q water were added. Samples were then shaken for 1 minute and left to stand for 9 3 \nminutes. This was repeated before swirling for a few seconds prior to extracting a sample for 4 \nmeasurement.  5 \n 6 \nAll samples were analysed at room temperature within 24-48 hours of collection from the 7 \nfield. Before analysis, samples were filtered using pre-ashed Whatman GFC (1.2\u00b5m) glass 8 \nfibre filters. The fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Varian Cary Eclipse 9 \nfluorescence spectrophotometer fitted with a Xenon flash lamp, using slit widths of 5 nm, an 10 \nintegration time of 12.5 ms and voltage of 725 V. The short integration time was necessary in 11 \norder to measure the large numbers of storm samples within the required 24-48 hours. 12 \nExcitation wavelengths were varied from 200 to 400 nm in steps of 5 nm and emission 13 \nwavelengths from 280 to 500 nm in steps of 2 nm. Absorbance was measured in a 1 cm 14 \ncuvette on a Varian Cary 50 UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 1 nm intervals from 800 to 15 \n200 nm. All absorbance spectra were referenced to a blank of Milli-Q water. Samples with 16 \nabsorbance at 254 nm greater than 1.5 AU cm-1, were diluted using Milli-Q water. This 17 \nthreshold was adopted for pragmatic reasons. It is considerably higher than the value of 0.3 18 \nAU cm-1 quoted by Ohno (2002) but within the limits found by Holland et al. (1977). 19 \n 20 \nThe absorbance measurements were long-wavelength scatter-corrected using the method of 21 \nBlough et al. (1993). Instrument corrections (Holbrook et al., 2006) were applied to the 22 \nfluorescence data to account for lamp output and for instrument sensitivity, following 23 \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Inner-filtering corrections were calculated from the 24 \ncorrected absorbance data (Lakowicz, 1983; Ohno, 2002) and applied to the fluorescence 25 \n 9\ndata. These corrected data were finally converted to Raman units (RU) using the method of 1 \nLawaetz and Stedmon (in press). This step normalizes the fluorescence intensity by the area 2 \nunder the Raman peak between emission wavelengths of 380 and 410 nm for an excitation 3 \nwavelength of 348 nm and, therefore, incorporates both a daily Raman correction and a 4 \nconversion to standard units. Over the entire period of measurement (January 2007 to January 5 \n2008), the area under the Raman peak was measured on 55 days; these measurements have a 6 \nmean value of 380.4 and a standard deviation of 5.7 arbitrary fluorescence units. 7 \n 8 \nTo represent the signal of tryptophan-like and fulvic\/humic-like fluorescence, indices (TI and 9 \nFI) were derived based on results from known standards and their mixtures. Thus, instead of 10 \nsimply using the fluorescence at, or in the region of, the peak for each of the anticipated 11 \nfluorophores, optimal regions of the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) were identified, taking 12 \ninto account the overlap between the separate fluorescence centres. The wavelengths defining 13 \neach region are given in Table 1 and the index is simply the average of the corrected 14 \nfluorescence intensities in the given region. A further approach using PARAFAC analysis 15 \n(Stedmon et al., 2003; Stedmon and Bro, in press) is also being conducted but is not presented 16 \nhere. 17 \nInsert Table 1 here 18 \n 19 \n3. RESULTS 20 \n 21 \nIn order to assess the potential for using fluorescence as a general indicator of slurry losses, 22 \nwe need to be able to demonstrate five points: (i) that there is a relationship, preferably linear, 23 \nbetween the fluorescence indices and slurry concentration; (ii) that there is a difference in the 24 \nfluorescence signal between slurry and drainage waters with no slurry contamination; (iii) that 25 \n 10\nfluorescence characteristics are similar in different slurries; (iv) that uncertainty in the data, 1 \nfrom sampling through to post-processing, is much smaller than the differences which we 2 \nhope to detect and (v) that temporal changes in the fluorescence signal are either minimal or 3 \npredictable. 4 \n 5 \nFigure 2 shows data from a dilution series prepared from an example slurry. It demonstrates 6 \nthat both the TI and the FI extracted from the corrected fluorescence data are linearly related 7 \nto slurry concentration. The results thus validate the fluorescence correction methods used 8 \nand confirm the linearity of the selected indices for natural slurry.  9 \n 10 \n    Insert Figure 2 here 11 \n 12 \nCorrected EEMs for a slurry and for drainage waters (with no slurry input) are given in 13 \nFigure 3. Data with an excitation wavelength below 240 nm are unreliable and are not shown. 14 \nFigure 3a clearly shows the large protein-like fluorescence signal found in slurry consisting of 15 \nlarge tyrosine-like and tryptophan-like peaks at an excitation wavelength (Ex) of 280 nm and 16 \nemission wavelengths (Em) of 304 and 348 nm respectively. Drainage waters, by contrast, 17 \nshow a large fulvic\/humic-like signal at higher excitation and emission wavelengths (Figure 18 \n3b) with peaks typically quoted in the literature at Ex 220-250 nm \/ Em 400-480 nm and Ex 19 \n300-380 nm \/ Em 400-480 nm (e.g. Baker and Spencer, 2004). Figure 3 thus confirms the 20 \ndistinction between the fluorescence signals from slurry and drainage waters found by Baker 21 \n(2002). In these two samples, the ratios of TI:FI are 2.4 for the slurry and 0.3 for the 22 \nuncontaminated drainage water. This eight-fold difference suggests that there is at least 23 \npotential for using the enrichment of the TI:FI ratio in drainage waters as an indicator of 24 \nslurry losses, even down to relatively small amounts of slurry. 25 \n 11\n 1 \n    Insert Figure 3 here 2 \n 3 \nFigure 4 shows the fluorescence and absorbance characteristics of the slurry used in the 4 \ntracing experiment in the context of nine different slurries sampled from farms around Devon 5 \nin June 2007. To give some indication of the variability in the measurements, box and 6 \nwhisker plots of the TI, FI, TI:FI ratio and absorbance at 254 nm are shown. For the slurry 7 \napplied during the RERP experiment (A), they were derived from triplicate measurements 8 \ncarried out on individual samples of the slurry applied to each of the six lysimeters. In the 9 \ncase of the farms (B-J), three samples of slurry were taken from each farm and triplicate 10 \nmeasurements were carried out on some of the individual samples. For these samples, it was 11 \nnot possible to thoroughly mix the slurry prior to sampling and the slurries varied in both age 12 \nand method of storage on the farm. There were also differences in the farm systems, with 13 \npotentially different feed stuffs and bedding material as well as livestock numbers and types. 14 \nFigure 4 shows that there are considerable differences in the values of fluorescence and 15 \nabsorbance between the different slurries. The slurries which have very low TI, FI and 16 \nabsorbance were very watery and the low values are thought to represent considerable dilution 17 \nduring storage on the farm. However, all slurry samples had a TI:FI ratio greater than 2 which 18 \nis much greater than that found in uncontaminated drainage waters which tend to have ratios 19 \nmuch less than 1, or example pore waters collected from the three no-slurry drained 20 \nlysimeters in January 2008 (TI:FI about 0.3). The slurry used in the RERP experiment is at 21 \nthe lower end of the TI:FI range with a lower than average TI. The observed variation 22 \nbetween the slurries implies that the prospects for general quantification of diffuse losses of 23 \nslurry, in terms of the proportion of slurry, are low as it will be important to know the 24 \nfluorescence characteristics of each applied slurry. However, the fact that the TI:FI ratio 25 \n 12\nacross all slurries is consistently high compared to drainage waters suggests that significant 1 \nslurry losses should be identifiable in the enrichment of the TI:FI ratio, confirming the 2 \npotential to use fluorescence, in cases with no sewage effluent, as an indicator of the 3 \nexistence, if not the magnitude, of losses. 4 \n 5 \n    Insert Figure 4 here 6 \n 7 \nUncertainties in fluorescence measurements of drainage waters from sampling through to 8 \nanalysis were estimated by taking ten consecutive samples from four sampling sites with 9 \ndifferent levels of slurry contamination in the nearby catchment of Den Brook. With little or 10 \nno contamination (TI<1), measurements of TI and FI were respectively within \u00b10.06 and 11 \n\u00b10.14 RU, with the TI:FI ratio, as calculated from each EEM, being within \u00b10.01. At high 12 \nlevels of contamination (TI>3), measurements of TI and FI were within \u00b10.32 and \u00b10.17 RU, 13 \nwith the TI:FI ratio being within \u00b10.08. In the context of the values shown in Figure 4 for the 14 \nvariation between slurries, this measurement uncertainty is negligible. 15 \n 16 \n3.1 Slurry tracing experiment 17 \nThe results of the slurry tracing experiment are shown in Figure 5 in terms of a summary of 18 \nthe TI:FI ratio for all the samples from all drainage paths for all the lysimeters. The data are 19 \nseparated out for the baseflow prior to slurry spreading, the two storm events sampled after 20 \nslurry spreading, and baseflow on two occasions following the storm sampling. Within each 21 \nsampling period, the data are arranged in treatment pairs, i.e. slurry (shaded) and no slurry, for 22 \neach flow pathway. The flow pathways, labelled on Figure 5, are surface\/throughflow from 23 \nthe undrained lysimeters (U), surface\/ throughflow from the drained lysimeters (S), and drain 24 \nflows from the drained lysimeters (D). There are very few baseflow samples as the lysimeters 25 \n 13\nonly flow during storm events or very wet periods. Each of these samples is shown as an 1 \nindividual point. The results from the storm-event samples are shown as box and whisker 2 \nplots with the box defining the inter-quartile range and the whiskers extending to the furthest 3 \ndata point within a distance of 1.5 times the interquartile range away from the box. Any 4 \noutliers beyond this are shown as individual points. The horizontal line in each of the boxes 5 \nshows the position of the median value. The number of samples which fall in each of the 6 \ncategories is given below the plot. 7 \n 8 \n    Insert Figure 5 here 9 \n 10 \nMost of the samples have TI:FI ratios less than 1.0. The exceptions to this are mainly samples 11 \ntaken during the storm immediately after slurry spreading from the drain flow pathway of the 12 \ndrained lysimeters receiving slurry. The TI:FI ratios for these samples have a median value of 13 \n1.58 and tend towards the values found in the raw slurry (Figure 4). They are, therefore, 14 \nthought to indicate the occurrence of incidental slurry losses through the drain flow pathway. 15 \nValues of the TI:FI ratio for the drain flow pathway of the lysimeters in receipt of slurry 16 \nremain relatively high in the second storm with a median value of 0.77. Prior to slurry 17 \nspreading, two samples, one each from the drain flow pathways of lysimeters 3 and 9, showed 18 \nsomewhat elevated TI:FI ratios. All lysimeters had been grazed by cows during the summer 19 \nprior to slurry spreading. However, this was not expected to have had a big effect on the TI:FI 20 \nratios or a preferential effect on lysimeters 3 and 9. Drained lysimeters 4 and 9 had received 21 \nslurry in May 2006 but, after 18 months, no residual signal is expected (see below). Thus, the 22 \nreason for these elevated values prior to slurry spreading is unknown. Samples of baseflow 23 \ntaken after the two sets of storm samples tend to suggest that TI:FI ratios in the drain flow 24 \npathways of lysimeters receiving slurry remain relatively elevated, although to gradually 25 \n 14\nlesser degrees. However, the number of baseflow samples taken before and after slurry 1 \napplication is too small to draw any substantive conclusions. 2 \n 3 \nIn the case of the samples from the surface\/throughflow pathways of both the undrained (U) 4 \nand drained lysimeters (S) shown in Figure 5, there is a slight tendency towards higher values 5 \nof TI:FI in those in receipt of slurry compared to those without. However, this is a very minor 6 \neffect compared to the results from the drain flow pathway of the drained lysimeters (D).   7 \n 8 \nIn order to test the hypothesis that there is a significant difference in the TI:FI response for the 9 \nlysimeters where slurry was applied, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed 10 \nunder the assumption of a completely randomised design, two treatment levels (slurry\/no 11 \nslurry) and three replicates. The data for each pathway in each storm were considered 12 \nseparately. To satisfy the assumptions of the ANOVA test, the reciprocal of the TI:FI ratio 13 \nwas used and outliers removed until a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was satisfied. For the 14 \nsamples taken during the October storm, Table 2 shows that no significant difference was 15 \ndetected (p-value>0.05) between the two treatments for the surface\/throughflow pathway of 16 \neither the undrained or drained lysimeters. However, the null hypothesis is rejected (p-17 \nvalue<0.05) for the drain flow pathway indicating that there is a statistically significant 18 \nenrichment of the TI:FI ratio in the drain flows from those drained lysimeters in receipt of 19 \nslurry. As shown in Table 3, a similar result is obtained for the samples taken in the 20 \nNovember storm with the null hypothesis being rejected (p-value<0.01) in the case of the 21 \ndrain flow pathway.  22 \n 23 \n    Insert Tables 2 and 3 here 24 \n 25 \n 15\nThese results clearly show that there is a marked difference in the fluorescence signal, 1 \nexpressed in terms of TI:FI, of water from the drain flow pathway for those lysimeters to 2 \nwhich slurry was applied compared to those without slurry. In the first storm, this difference 3 \nis associated with large values of TI which is consistent with a slurry source. Elevated TI:FI 4 \nratios in the drain flow pathway of slurry-amended lysimeters during the first storm is also 5 \nassociated with elevated concentrations of ammonium which has an average value of 6 \n4.6 mg N L-1 compared to 0.65 mg N L-1 for drain flows without slurry. This again is 7 \nindicative of a slurry source. In the second storm, the higher TI:FI ratios in the slurry-8 \namended drain flow pathways are the result of only a slightly higher TI coupled with a much 9 \nlower FI. Ammonium levels are only slightly elevated but there is a substantial difference in 10 \nthe concentrations of nitrate with an average value of 9.6 mg N L-1, compared to 5.5 mg N L-1 11 \nfor the drain flows with no slurry-amendment. These findings imply that there is potential to 12 \nuse fluorescence as a direct indicator of diffuse slurry losses immediately following slurry 13 \napplication but that over subsequent weeks, the nature and strength of the signal changes. 14 \n 15 \n3.2 Tray experiment 16 \nThe tray experiment was designed to provide information on the change in the fluorescence 17 \nsignal from the applied slurry over time and the results are presented in Figure 6. Also shown 18 \nare the values measured in the applied slurry. Comparison of these values and those of the 19 \ntray sub-samples immediately after application suggests that about 80% of the fluorescence 20 \nsignal is lost once the slurry is applied to the vermiculite. This implies significant adsorption 21 \nof the chemicals onto the surface of the vermiculite which our extraction method did not 22 \nrelease. The adsorption onto the soil or a vegetated soil surface is unknown. Further work is 23 \nneeded to explore other extraction methods and leaching experiments with vegetated soil 24 \ncores in order to fully quantify this initial effect. However, when focussing on the TI:FI ratio, 25 \n 16\nthe first set of tray samples shows only a small reduction in TI:FI compared to the applied 1 \nslurry (Figure 6) and, therefore, this initial adsorption does not invalidate the results based on 2 \nthe TI:FI ratio. 3 \n 4 \n    Insert Figure 6 here 5 \n 6 \nLooking at the change over the succeeding weeks, Figure 6 shows that there is a preferential 7 \nloss of tryptophan-like fluorescence over the first two or three weeks which quickly reduces 8 \nthe TI:FI ratio to about 0.7, which is more commensurate with that found in the drainage 9 \nwaters (Figure 5). This loss is assumed to be due to microbial activity which breaks down the 10 \nmolecules associated with the protein-like fluorescence. Other decay experiments (not shown 11 \nhere) using different application rates and including examples with a covering of vermiculite 12 \nover the top of the slurry to simulate subsurface (i.e. in the absence of light) degradation, 13 \nshowed similar findings with a strong tryptophan-like fluorescence signal one week following 14 \napplication which was reduced by a factor of about four some four weeks later. The similarity 15 \nof findings from the surface and subsurface experiments implies that there is little effect of 16 \nphotodegradation on the fluorescence signal. Experiments simulating conditions which may 17 \nbe found in drains or pipes were not performed. 18 \n 19 \nThe decay over time shown in Figure 6 substantiates in part the findings from the field 20 \nexperiment. The initial storm event was only 3-5 days after the slurry application, i.e. about 21 \nthe same time as the first tray samples, so we can be confident that the fluorescence data 22 \nshown for this storm reflect the slurry signal and are consistent with direct incidental losses 23 \nthrough the field drains. The second storm event, however, occurred some five weeks after 24 \nthe slurry application. The results from the tray experiment shown in Figure 6 suggest that by 25 \n 17\nthis time most of the tryptophan-like signal has disappeared while the fulvic\/humic-like signal 1 \nremains somewhat elevated, thus giving a minimal TI:FI ratio of around 0.7. While this does 2 \nnot explain the elevated TI:FI ratio found in samples of drain flow from the slurry-amended 3 \nlysimeters during the second storm, it does reinforce the need for careful interpretation of 4 \nthese results. 5 \n 6 \n4. DISCUSSION 7 \n 8 \nThe data presented here have demonstrated the potential for using natural fluorescence as an 9 \nindicator of diffuse slurry losses, in liquid phase, following application to land. Measurements 10 \nof natural fluorescence are highly reliable, provided that samples are stored in the cool and in 11 \nthe dark and measured within 24-48 hours of collection. There is a strong linear relationship 12 \nbetween fluorescence intensity, as expressed in the TI and FI indices, and slurry 13 \nconcentration; the TI:FI ratio for slurry is substantially higher than that found in drainage 14 \nwaters which are uncontaminated by slurry; and the combined sampling and measurement 15 \nuncertainty is low. 16 \n 17 \nProspects for quantifying diffuse slurry losses, in terms of the proportion of the applied slurry, 18 \nhowever, are limited except for incidental losses in specific experiments or from specific 19 \nsources. There are two issues here. The first of these is the variability in the fluorescence 20 \nsignal, including the TI:FI ratio, between different slurries. This variability is presumably 21 \ndependent on the age of the slurry and the method of storage on the farm, as well as 22 \ndifferences in the farm system (feed stuffs, bedding material, livestock etc). Despite this 23 \nvariability, the results shown highlight the distinction between the fluorescence signal from 24 \nslurry and that from drainage water uncontaminated by slurry. This is consistent with the 25 \n 18\nfindings of Ohno and Bro (2006) who also showed that DOM from manures was 1 \nquantitatively very variable but had a distinct fluorescence characteristic compared to DOM 2 \nfrom soils, on the one hand, and biota (crops, wetland plants and tree leaves) on the other. 3 \n 4 \nThe second issue, which relates to the use of natural fluorescence in quantifying slurry losses, 5 \nis the change in the fluorescence signal over time following its application to land. The TI:FI 6 \nenrichment measured in the drain flows in the second storm may be an indicator of slurry 7 \nloss, involving temporary storage in the drains and subsequent re-mobilisation. However, it is 8 \nnot associated with high levels of TI and the tray experiment, investigating the change in the 9 \nfluorescence signal from slurry over time, suggests that high levels of tryptophan-like 10 \nfluorescence may be largely lost by the time of the second storm, giving a reduced TI:FI ratio 11 \nof 0.7. This is very close to the median value for the sampled slurry-amended drain flows of 12 \n0.77. An alternative explanation for the signal from the drain flows is that the addition of 13 \nslurry enhances microbial activity in these pathways and that it is the products from this 14 \nsecondary effect which are being measured. Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact 15 \nthat the elevated TI:FI ratios in the first storm are associated with elevated concentrations of 16 \nammonium whereas, in the second storm, they are associated with high nitrate concentrations. 17 \n 18 \nThe fluorescence characteristics of fresh and decomposed DOM have been investigated by 19 \nHunt and Ohno (2007). Their work is based on extracted DOM and they report a reduction in 20 \ntryptophan-like fluorescence and in the ratio of tryptophan-like to humic-like fluorescence for 21 \ndairy manure after only 10 days of decomposition. They also report an increase in the 22 \nhumification index (i.e the ratio of the fluorescence at emission wavelengths 435-480 nm to 23 \nthat at 300-345nm for an excitation wavelength of 255 nm). Median values of the 24 \nhumification index from our tray experiment increase from 3.3 (the raw slurry has a value of 25 \n 19\n1.4 implying some preferential adsorption to vermiculite) for the first set of tray samples to 1 \n4.7 at the time of the second storm. For the sampled drain flows, the humification index for 2 \nthe slurry-amended lysimeters has a median value of 1.1 in the first storm and 6.3 in the 3 \nsecond storm, compared with values of 11.4 and 10.3 respectively from the drains with no 4 \nslurry amendment. This implies that the fluorescence data from the second storm may well be 5 \nindicative of the loss of decomposed slurry. Hunt and Ohno (2007) explain the increase in the 6 \nhumification index by the synthesis or release of higher molecular weight, more aromatic, 7 \nmoieties into solution. Extracellular polymeric substances produced by microbial excretion 8 \nand cell lysis are known to contain large molecular weight aromatic substances and the 9 \nproduction of these during decomposition may be partly responsible for the change in the 10 \nfluorescence signal. Further work is needed to clarify the fluorescence signals associated with 11 \nthe processes of slurry transport, decomposition and carbon sequestration within soils as well 12 \nas the transport and decomposition processes within drains. 13 \n 14 \nIn terms of incidental losses, the experimental evidence presented here has shown the 15 \nimportance of field drains as a pathway for slurry losses in heavy clay soils. This concurs with 16 \nthe findings of Hodgkinson et al. (2002) and Withers et al. (2003). Incidental losses during 17 \nthe first storm were particularly apparent from the drain flow pathway of lysimeter 9. Here the 18 \nenrichment of the TI:FI ratio is associated with TI values around 9.6 RU. These high levels of 19 \nTI were measured in four successive samples over a period of 5.4 hours. With the exception 20 \nof one value (from the drain flow from lysimeter 5), all other measurements of TI are less 21 \nthan 1.64 RU. Assuming that this represents the maximum background level of TI and taking 22 \ninto account uncertainty in the flow data, from the TI calibration curve for the RERP slurry,  23 \nwe estimate that some 2-8 kg slurry were lost in liquid phase via the drain flow pathway from 24 \nlysimeter 9 during the first storm. Furthermore, assuming a slurry density of approximately 25 \n 20\n1000 kg m-3, we can calculate that this represents 0.004-0.016% of what was applied to the 1 1 \nhectare lysimeter. This is clearly only a very small fraction of the applied slurry and 2 \ndemonstrates the sensitivity of the technique. In the context of other published incidental 3 \nlosses (e.g. Withers et al., 2003), it should be noted that the October storm fell on relatively 4 \ndry ground which meant that this was a very minor flow event with the total volume of the 5 \ndrain flow from lysimeter 9 being only 1.7% (0.5-2.8%) rainfall. The high soluble reactive 6 \nphosphorus and BOD content of slurry (Hooda et al., 2000; Defra, 2009), however, suggests 7 \nthat even this small amount may have a significant impact in terms of stream ecology, 8 \nespecially in headwater streams. 9 \n 10 \nOne of the key advantages of natural fluorescence is that measurements are relatively quick 11 \nand inexpensive, compared with that of some nutrient fractions, BOD and faecal indicator 12 \norganisms (FIOs). At the catchment scale, Baker and Inverarity (2004) and Hudson et al. 13 \n(2008) have shown a strong relationship between tryptophan-like fluorescence and BOD. In 14 \nthis larger scale context, the sources of BOD include sewage and industrial effluents which 15 \nindividually also show high correlations between tryptophan-like fluorescence and BOD 16 \n(Reynolds and Ahmad, 1997; Baker and Curry, 2004). Little or no work has been done to 17 \nrelate the fluorescence from agricultural sources to BOD or to FIOs and further work is 18 \nneeded in this area. Indeed, in terms of river monitoring, it is the impact which matters rather 19 \nthan the proportion of slurry (raw or decomposed) which is lost. Hence, it may be that 20 \nfluorescence has greater potential to quantify impact than loss. This, coupled with the 21 \npotential to development techniques for in situ instrumentation (cf. Baker et al., 2004; 22 \nSpencer et al., 2007), is particularly important in the context of the very short-lived intense 23 \nspikes of diffuse pollution which we have measured from agricultural sources both from areas 24 \n 21\nof hard standing (Granger et al., in press) and, as described here, through drains in heavy clay 1 \nsoils following slurry-application to land. 2 \n 3 \n5. CONCLUSIONS 4 \n 5 \nThe results presented have demonstrated the use of natural fluorescence as an indicator of 6 \ndiffuse slurry losses, in liquid phase, following slurry application to land. Specifically, they 7 \nshow that 8 \n\u2022 there is a strong linear relationship between fluorescence intensity (as expressed by TI and 9 \nFI) and slurry concentration; 10 \n\u2022 the TI:FI ratio is a good indicator of slurry contamination with values from slurry 11 \nconsistently greater than 2 and values from uncontaminated field drainage less than 1; 12 \n\u2022 there is considerable variability in the TI:FI ratio (2<TI:FI<5) between different slurries 13 \nwhich limits quantification to cases where the signal from the applied slurry is known; 14 \n\u2022 the combined sampling and measurement uncertainty for fluorescence is low;  15 \n\u2022 incidental slurry losses, indicated by significantly enhanced TI:FI ratios, high TI and high 16 \nammonium levels, occurred via the drain flow pathways of the slurry-amended lysimeters 17 \nin the small storm immediately following slurry spreading \u2013 the maximum estimated loss 18 \nfrom a single lysimeter was 2-8 kg or 0.004-0.016% of the applied slurry; 19 \n\u2022 there are large changes in the strength and nature of the fluorescence signal from slurry 20 \nover time periods of days to weeks, with a preferential reduction in TI; 21 \n\u2022 significantly enhanced TI:FI ratios in the drain flows during the second larger storm event, 22 \nsome five weeks after slurry spreading, were not associated with high TI but with high 23 \nnitrate levels and an increase in the humification index which is consistent with the loss of 24 \ndecomposed slurry.  25 \n 22\n 1 \nFurther work is needed to fully characterise the fluorescence signals associated with slurry, 2 \nparticularly in the context of its transport and decomposition within soils and field drains. 3 \nData are also required to define the relationships between fluorescence, BOD and FIOs for 4 \nagricultural wastes. The key advantages of fluorescence as an indicator of slurry loss 5 \ncompared to these other determinands are its ease of measurement and the potential for in situ 6 \nmonitoring which could capture very short-lived spikes of diffuse pollution such as the 7 \nincidental losses through field drains highlighted here.  8 \n 9 \n 10 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 11 \n 12 \nThis paper arises from research funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food and 13 \nRural Affairs (Defra) and was carried out under project PE0120 in association with project 14 \nWQ0106.
