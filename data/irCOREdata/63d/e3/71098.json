Results are presented of the artificial optical emis-\nsion of the atomic oxygen red line (the radiation of level\nO(1D) with a wavelength of 630 nm) from the HF-pumped\nionosphere, obtained in September 2004 at the SURA heat-\ning facility situated near Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. For ver-\ntical pumping the airglow patch was increasingly displaced\nto the north, up to 7\u20138\u25e6, with increasing reflection altitude.\nFor large brightness of the emission, the airglow patch started\nto develop at the northern edge of the pump beam and later\nexpanded to the south. These effects are attributed to the\nprecipitation of supra-thermal electrons from the pump wave\nupper hybrid resonance altitude to lower altitudes where ex-\ncitation of the O(1D) level is more effective due to the larger\ndensity of atomic oxygen, and the O(1D) lifetime is shorter.\nFor a pump beam inclination of 12\u25e6 to the south, the opti-\ncal spot was displaced by 4\u20135\u25e6 to the south relative to the\nstraight-line projection of the pump beam onto the sky. This\nexceeds that expected from the ray tracing and may be re-\nlated, most probably, to the so-called \u201cmagnetic zenith\u201d ef-\nfect. In addition, mid-scale (1\u201310 km) magnetic field-aligned\nstructures were observed in the pumped volume of the iono-\nsphere. The east-west motions of the airglow patches are also\nanalyzed.\nKeywords.

(2005) found some\nevidence of electron acceleration up to 60 eV. The plasma\nheating and electron acceleration cause an airglow enhance-\nment due to excitation of the neutrals by electron impact\n(Haslett and Megill, 1974). The brightest optical emission\nis the red line of atomic oxygen (the radiation of level O(1D)\nwith a wavelength of 630 nm and has an excitation threshold\nenergy of 1.96 eV). The other emissions from atomic oxygen\nand molecular nitrogen (O and N2) at wavelengths 557.7 nm\n[level O(1S)], 844.6 nm [level O(3p3P)] and 427.8 nm [level\nN+2 (B26\u2212u )] have larger excitation thresholds (4.17, 10.99,\n18 eV, respectively) and smaller excitation cross sections;\nsee, e.g. Gustavson et al. (2005). The artificial airglow\nhas been studied since early 1970s at different ionospheric\nheating facilities, such as Arecibo (Puerto-Rico), Platteville\n(Boulder, Colorado), EISCAT (Troms\u00f8, Norway), SURA\n(Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia), HAARP and HIPAS (Alaska).\nObservations of the artificial airglow are used to study\nthe electron acceleration by HF pump-driven electrostatic\nplasma waves, as well as for mapping of the ionosphere\n(Haslett and Megill, 1974; Bernhardt et al., 1989a,b; Leyser\net al., 2000; Bernhardt et al., 1991, 2000; Pedersen and Carl-\nson, 2001; Gustavson et al., 2001, 2005; Gumerov et al.,\n1999; Grach et al., 2004; Kosch et al., 2002a, 2005). Map-\nping of the pumped volume with CCD cameras is used for re-\nmote sensing of the large-scale irregularities of both natural\nand HF-pump driven origin. Velocities of their drift motion,\nas well as diffusion coefficients and the lifetime of the O(1D)\nquenching can be determined from an analysis of the artifi-\ncial airglow images (Bernhardt et al., 1989b; Leyser et al.,\n2000; Bernhardt et al., 2000; Pedersen and Carlson, 2001).\nRecently, the so-called magnetic zenith effect (MZE), a sig-\nnificant enhancement of the airglow intensity accompanied\nby a dramatic increase in the electron temperature during\npumping along the geomagnetic field line direction, was dis-\ncovered with the use of optical observations at the HAARP\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n690 S. M. Grach et al.: On the location and structure...\nand EISCAT facilities (Kosch et al., 2000; Gurevich et al.,\n2002; Pedersen et al., 2003; Rietveld et al., 2003). In some\nexperiments mid-scale (\u223c1 km) magnetic field-aligned struc-\ntures in the HF pumped ionosphere are seen in the optical\nimages (see, e.g. Djuth et al., 2005). Such structures were\nalso obtained by different radio methods and in-situ measure-\nments (Basu et al., 1997; Kelley et al., 1995; Frolov et al.,\n2001; Myasnikov et al., 2001; Djuth et al., 2006). The ex-\nistence of such structures is supported by theoretical predic-\ntions (e.g. Perkins and Valeo, 1974; Vas\u2019kov and Gurevich,\n1979; Gurevich et al., 2002).\nTwo candidates for the electron acceleration are Langmuir\nwaves and upper hybrid turbulence. Langmuir waves ap-\npear due to the ponderomotive parametric instabilities near\nthe pump wave reflection point z0, at which fpe(zr)=f0,\nand propagate mainly along the magnetic field (Al\u2019ber et\nal., 1974; Perkins et al., 1974; DuBois et al., 1990). Up-\nper hybrid waves initially appear due to the thermal paramet-\nric instability, mainly across the magnetic field, a few kilo-\nmeters below zr near the upper hybrid (UH) resonance alti-\ntude zUH, at which fpe(zUH)=[f 20 \u2212f 2ce(zUH)]1\/2, where fpe\nand fce are the local ionospheric electron plasma and elec-\ntron cyclotron frequencies, respectively (Grach et al., 1977;\nVas\u2019kov and Gurevich, 1977; Robinson, 1989). During the\ndeveloped stage of the thermal parametric instability, the up-\nper hybrid waves essentially broaden their spatial and an-\ngular spectrum (Grach et al., 1981) and excite, as a pump,\ndaughter upper hybrid, Langmuir, and lower hybrid waves\nunder different ponderomotive nonlinear processes (Grach,\n1981; Kuo et al., 1997; Istomin and Leyser, 1998; Mishin\net al., 2004). The question of which candidate dominates\nis under long-standing theoretical discussion (Weistock and\nBezzerides, 1974; Gurevich et al., 1985; Grach et al., 1986;\nDimant et al., 1992; Grach, 1999; Gurevich et al., 2002; Is-\ntomin and Leyser, 2003) but still remains to be resolved. Re-\ncent experimental achievements demonstrated that for long\n(&10 s), pumping electron acceleration is linked to the upper\nhybrid turbulence while short (&10 ms) pump pulses provide\nan effective acceleration by Langmuir waves (Gumerov et al.,\n1999; Gustavson et al., 2001; Kosch et al., 2002b; Grach\net al., 2004; Gustavson et al., 2005). Notice that Mishin et\nal. (2004) have shown that lower hybrid waves can efficiently\naccelerate electrons during HF heating, although to lesser en-\nergies than Langmuir waves.\nBelow we report new results on the mapping of the iono-\nspheric pumped volume in the oxygen red line (630 nm) ob-\ntained at the SURA heating facility. These experiments were\naimed at studying the MZE for mid-latitude conditions: at\nthe SURA facility the magnetic field elevation angle (71.5\u25e6)\nis less than at EISCAT and HAARP (77.2\u25e6 and 75\u25e6, respec-\ntively), therefore conditions for the MZE must be different at\nthe SURA facility (Gurevich et al., 2005). Some evidence of\nthe MZE at the SURA facility has been obtained by radio-\ntomography from satellites (Tereshchenko et al., 2004). In\nour experiments we have found new evidence of the MZE. In\naddition, we were able to resolve mid-scale magnetic field-\naligned structures in the pumped volume; analyzed east-west\nmotions of the airglow patches; and we observed a north-\nward displacement of the airglow patch with increasing pump\nwave reflection height for vertical pumping. A comparison\nof the optical patch positions along the north-south merid-\nian with ray tracing of the pump wave reveals which elec-\ntrostatic waves were responsible for the electron acceleration\nand therefore for the artificial optical emissions.\n2 Experimental data\nThe experiment was carried out in September 2004 at the\nSURA radio facility near Nizhny Novgorod, Russia (geo-\ngraphical coordinates 56.13\u25e6 N, 46.10\u25e6 E, geomagnetic field\ndeclination and inclination are \u224810.0\u25e6 east and \u224871.5\u25e6,\nrespectively). According to the ionospheric conditions,\non 14 September the SURA facility was operated at fre-\nquencies close to the fourth electron gyroharmonic (5.275\u2013\n5.345 MHz). On the other days of the campaign (15, 17 and\n18 September) SURA was operated at the lowest available\nfrequency of transmitters, f0=4.3 MHz. At this frequency\nthe effective radiated power is \u2248150 MW. The HF beam\nwidth at the Sura facility is \u224812\u25e6 when pointing in the verti-\ncal direction and by about 1\u20132\u25e6 wider for beam dip angles of\n12\u25e6 and 16\u25e6, which were used in the experiment. A square\nwave pump modulation of 2 min on, 2 min off, with a period\nclose to the radiative lifetime of O(1D) (107 s), was used.\nOptical imaging was performed using a Peltier-cooled\nfront-illuminated bare CCD camera with 16-bit slow-scan\nread-out (SBIG ST9E). In addition to cooling, the images\nwere binned down to 256\u00d7256 pixels, in order to increase\nsensitivity and reduce noise. A f=50 mm F0.7 lens, giving\na \u224813\u25e6 field of view was used. Using the stars, the cam-\nera look direction was adjusted to be parallel to the pump\nbeam. The relatively small field of view gives a spatial\nresolution of \u22480.5 km in the F-layer, suitable for imaging\nsmall-scale structures. For the entire campaign, a 630-nm\nfilter was used with 27-s integration and 3-s housekeeping\ntime, giving a 30-s cycle. Calibration of the images into\nRayleighs was performed by using the same imager to view\nthe reflected output of a known lamp. Optical observations\nof the HF pumped ionosphere were accompanied by record-\ning the spectra of the Stimulated Electromagnetic Emissions\n(SEE), a secondary radiation from the ionospheric pumped\nvolume (Leyser, 2001), with a HP3585 spectrum analyzer.\nAn ionosonde co-located with SURA made soundings every\n10 min. However, some of the ionograms obtained during\nSURA operations could not be analyzed because of strong\nanomalous absorption of the ionosonde signal during HF\npumping.\nOn 14 and 15 September the HF beam was pointed in the\nvertical direction. On 14 September the pump frequency\nchanged every 4 min (from cycle to cycle) by 10 kHz near\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 689\u2013700, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/689\/2007\/\nS. M. Grach et al.: On the location and structure... 691\n4th electron gyroharmonic. As estimated by the Broad Up-\nshifted Maximum feature\u2019s position in the SEE spectra (for\ndetails see, e.g. Leyser, 2001), the interaction between the\npump wave and plasma occurred near 260\u2013270 km altitude.\nWeak red line airglow with a maximum intensity of \u223c5 R\nagainst a decreasing background was obtained around 21:21\u2013\n21:45 LT. Neither the structure of the images nor the average\nairglow intensity showed a clear dependence on the pump\nwave frequency.\nOn 15 September the experiment lasted from 21:10 LT\ntill 23:24 LT with the pump wave frequency fixed at\nf0=4.3 MHz. The data are presented in Figs. 1\u20133. Figure 1\n(top panel) shows the time sequence of 630-nm airglow in-\ntensity, spatially averaged over the imager field of view, in\nRayleighs. The data have been background subtracted; the\nintensity is measured relative to a minimum background in-\ntensity obtained at 23:02 LT. The square wave represents the\nHF pump wave on\/off cycles. A decrease in the background\nbrightness for 21:10\u201323:00 LT is due to decreasing sunlight\nafter sunset.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 1 shows the real reflection height\nof the HF pump wave, derived from ionograms vs. time. It\nshould be noted that the accuracy of such a derivation is quite\nlow due to strong natural F-spread. For the ionogram analysis\nwe used the lower border of the reflected ionosonde signal,\nthe upper border would have given altitudes by about 30 km\nhigher. However, the presence of the reflected HF pump\nwave signal (f0<fO F2) corresponded to critical frequencies\nfO F2 derived from the lower border. The presence of strong\nF-spread provides evidence for the existence of strong, large-\nscale irregularities of plasma density in the upper ionosphere.\nA correlation between pump wave on\/off time and air-\nglow intensity increase\/decrease is clearly seen in the upper\npanel of Fig. 1 during the interval 21:10\u201323:10 LT. The air-\nglow intensity grows during each \u201cpump on\u201d interval (2 min),\ndecreases during the \u201cpump-off\u201d intervals, somewhat faster\nduring the first minute of no pumping. During the inter-\nval 21:10\u201321:25 LT, the average intensity of artificial air-\nglow was \u223c15 R above the background. Later, during the\ninterval 21:30\u201321:40 LT, it increased up to 25 R, then notice-\nably decreased (up to \u223c10 R) after 21:44 LT, and further de-\ncreased down to \u223c5 R after 22:12 LT. The reason for the in-\ntensity minimum at 22:20\u201322:24 LT is discussed later. After\n23:08 LT the artificial airglow disappeared, together with a\ndramatic decrease in the SEE intensity, despite that the iono-\nspheric plasma was still overdense according to ionograms,\nand the reflection of the pump wave was still observed.\nA set of false color airglow patch images during one pump\ncycle (21:26:00\u201321:30:00 LT) is presented in Fig. 2. The end\ntime of each 27-s integration is shown in the images. North\nand east are at the bottom and right of each image, respec-\ntively.

The maximum airglow intensity\nduring this cycle was obtained before the pump switched off\n(21:27:55 LT) and achieved 42 R (maximum without averag-\ning pixels = 58 R). The airglow patch started to appear as a\ndouble patch: the brighter western portion appeared at the\nnorthern edge of the HF beam and expanded later mainly\nto the south towards the the beam center, along the mag-\nnetic field line. The eastern part of the patch appears near\nthe center of the HF beam in the south-north direction and\nlater expands without any displacement. Later, both parts of\nthe patch overlap, which leads to an apparent southwestward\nexpansion of the whole patch. During the pump-off phase\nthe patch does not exhibit any noticeable displacement as it\nfades. Such a southward spread along the magnetic field,\nbut without a double patch structure and therefore apparent\nsouthwestward expansion, was observed only during 4 pump\ncycles corresponding to a large brightness at the center of the\npatch &37\u201350 R (21:26\u201321:40 LT). In other pump cycles the\nposition of the patches did not vary visibly.\nOn the other hand, perceptible displacements of the op-\ntical patch position over the sequence of images through\ntime were observed. This is illustrated by Fig. 3, which\nshows a sequence of images obtained during the last 27 s\nof each pump-on cycle.

The background image was recorded at 21:25:55 LT. North and east are at\nthe bottom and right of each image. The white circle is a mapping of the 12\u25e6 wide HF pump beam. The black arrows show the direction of\nthe geomagnetic field projection.\nsimultaneously with an increase of the airglow brightness\n(Fig. 1), the patch displaces to the north, and the maxi-\nmum brightness was observed at \u22485\u25e6 from the center of\nthe HF beam. At the same time the patch displaced to the\neast by approximately 1\u25e6 every 4 min, which corresponds\nto a horizontal velocity of \u224820 m\/s at an altitude of 280\u2013\n300 km. At 21:46\u201322:06 LT, when the 630-nm airglow in-\ntensity decreases, the northward displacement decreased by\n\u22481\u25e6, and the patch did not move noticeably. During this\ntime, some optical structures approximately parallel to geo-\nmagnetic field projection are seen in the images. Such struc-\ntures are seen also from time to time in the earlier and later\nimages (e.g. images from 21:23:55 LT and 21:55:55 LT in\nFig. 2). During 22:10\u201322:20 LT, the airglow patch displaced\nto the north by \u22484\u25e6, the brightest area displaced from 3\u20134\u25e6\nto 7\u20138\u25e6 to the north from the center of the HF beam pro-\njection concurrent with westward drifting of the patch. The\nbehavior of subsequent airglow patches looks like successive\neast-west drifting of 2 blobs, in which the 630-nm airglow\nis excited by the HF pump, with the same angular velocity\nof 0.63\u25e6 per 4 min (linear velocity \u224813 m\/s at 280\u2013300 km),\nbut with different positions in the south-north direction. The\nfirst patch with the brightest area at &7\u20138\u25e6 to the north from\nthe beam center existed at 22:22\u201322:36 LT; the second patch\nat \u22484\u20136\u25e6 to the north existed from 22:42 till 23:08 LT. Later,\nthe artificial 630-nm airglow was not excited. This is con-\nsistent with a successive motion of the airglow clouds across\nthe ionospheric heated volume reported by Bernhardt et al.\n(2000).\nThree points are noted. First, a noticeable decrease in\nthe average artificial airglow intensity in Fig. 1 at 22:22\u2013\n22:30 LT is due to the fact that about a half of the air-\nglow patch is outside the imager field of view. Second,\nthe median filter removed only the brightest stars, but the\nweaker ones, appearing about 5\u201310 R brighter than the back-\nground, remain in the images (see images taken from 22:23\ntill 23:08 LT). It is seen from these images that the artifi-\ncial airglow patches drift across the imager field of view with\nthe same apparent velocity (0.63\u25e6 per 4 min) as the stars.\nSuch westward drift also can be seen at 21:10\u201321:20 and\n21:54\u201322:20 LT, respectively. Third, in some images (e.g.\n21:23:55 LT) two connected airglow patches can be seen.\nThis becomes clear when comparing the images with pre-\nvious\/subsequent images.\nThe SEE spectra recorded were typical for f0=4.3 MHz,\nthe frequency being situated well between the 3rd and\n4th electron cyclotron harmonics and contained prominent\nDownshifted Maximum, Broad Continuum, and Broad Up-\nshifted Structure spectral features (Frolov et al., 2001;\nSergeev et al., 2006). Such type of the SEE spectra are classi-\nfied as a \u201cstrong emission\u201d (Sergeev et al., 2006) and charac-\nterize well developed upper hybrid turbulence. The intensity\nof all features decreased slightly with time till 23:08 LT, af-\nter which the intensity rapidly dropped. No clear correlation\nbetween the SEE and airglow brightness or patch positions\nwas obtained.\nOn 17 and 18 September the HF pump beam was inclined\nto the south of vertical. Unfortunately, the time and quality of\nthe optical measurements were limited by clouds and lasted\nonly 20 min on both nights. Even during these intervals the\nsky was covered by a thin cloud layer. The best images ob-\ntained are presented in Fig. 4. On 18 September, when the\npump beam zenith angle was 16\u25e6, the 630-nm airglow patch\nwith a brightness .20 R was located in the center of the HF\nbeam. On 17 September, the HF beam was pointed 12\u25e6 south\nfrom vertical. In this case, the airglow patch with a brightness\nAnn.

For this experiment,\nit is impossible to determine an angular size and position of\nthe southern boundary of the airglow patch, since it extends\nbeyond the imager field of view.\n3 Discussion\nDuring 14\u201318 September 2004 we ran a campaign to study\nthe artificial airglow at 630 nm (the radiation of level O(1D)\nof the atomic oxygen). The airglow appears due to electron\nacceleration by pump-driven plasma waves and excitation of\nthe neutrals by collisions with the accelerated electrons. The\nexperimental data obtained contributes to the knowledge of\nthe behavior of the pumped volume in the ionosphere. The\noptical data provides spatial resolution beyond anything a\nradar can achieve.\n3.1 Variations of the airglow intensity\nThe airglow intensity and angular size of the airglow patch\nvaried during the 2.5 h of experiments on 15 September over\nrather wide limits: from 5 to 25 R averaged across the im-\nager\u2019s field of view, and from 15 to 50 R maximum brightness\nin the center of the patch. Similar values of the intensity were\nobserved at the SURA facility in 1993 and 1995 by Bern-\nhardt et al. (2000). In the earlier experiments of 1990 during\nsolar maximum, intensities up to &200 R were observed. In-\ntensities of similar order (20\u2013100 R) have been observed at\nthe Arecibo, EISCAT and HAARP facilities (e.g. Bernhardt\net al., 1989a,b; Kosch et al., 2002a; Pedersen and Carlson,\n2001). The variations of the brightness do not show any clear\ncorrelation with pump power (for the cases where the power\nexceeds the threshold power for airglow excitation) or with\nthe pump wave freque cy, except for the cases of pumping\nnear multiple electron gyrofrequencies, f0\u223cnfce, n=2, 3, 4,\netc. In the latter case a decrease in the brightness was ob-\ntained for n=3, 4 (Bernhardt et al., 2000; Kosch et al., 2002b)\nand an increase for n=2 (Kosch et al., 2005). In our ex-\nperiments near the 4th gyroharmonic on 14 September only\nvery weak airglow was obtained. On 15 September a no-\nticeable growth of the brightness (from \u223c30 R to \u223c50 R) oc-\ncurred, together with an increase in the reflection altitude at\n\u224821:30 LT, but later (at about 21:45 LT and about 22:10 LT)\nreductions in the brightness does not seem to coincide with\nany other phenomena. The variations of the airglow intensity\ncan be influenced by changes in the background population\nof suprathermal electrons with energies of 0.5\u22121 eV. Ac-\ncording to theoretical studies by Grach et al. (1986); Grach\n(1999) the efficiency of acceleration strongly depends on the\npresence and \u201cinitial\u201d background of such electrons. This\ncomes about because pump-driven plasma waves do not ac-\ncelerate thermal electrons effectively. The population of the\n\u201cinitial\u201d suprathermal electrons in the HF-pumped volume\nof the ionosphere is quite numerous during the daytime but\ndecreases dramatically at nighttime (see, e.g. Sergeev et al.,\n2004) when optical observations become possible.\nGrach et al. (1998) reported that under near-identical iono-\nspheric background conditions (close to local midnight, al-\ntitude, critical frequency and scale length of the F-region),\nand the same pump frequency and power, opposite results\nwere obtained by multi-frequency Doppler sounding of the\npumped volume, while on 30 June 1989 a well-defined de-\npletion of ionospheric plasma from the pump wave upper\nhybrid altitude was observed near midnight and attributed to\nthe plasma heating; an increase in the plasma density related\nto additional ionization by accelerated electrons occurred on\n28\u201329 August 1990. A weak enhancement of geomagnetic\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 689\u2013700, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/689\/2007\/\nS. M. Grach et al.: On the location and structure... 695\nactivity two days before the latter case was the only differ-\nence found. This difference arguably may have contributed\nto an enhanced background of suprathermal electrons.\nIn addition, geomagnetic activity reduces the O\/N2 neu-\ntral composition in the F-layer through Joule heating. Varia-\ntions in the O\/N2 ratio up to an order of magnitude are pos-\nsible (Strickland et al., 2001). The vibrational states of N2\nare strong absorbers of pump-accelerated electrons (Mishin\net al., 2000; Vlasov et al., 2004), but results in no N2 optical\nemissions. Hence, any significant geomagnetic activity up to\na couple of days prior to an artificial airglow experiment sig-\nnificantly reduces the possibility of producing pump-induced\noptical emissions. The small airglow intensity on 14 Septem-\nber is possibly due to this effect under the prevailing geo-\nphysical conditions (Kp=5+). On 15, 17 and 18 September\ngeophysical conditions were much quieter, namely Kp=2, 3\nand 0, respectively, and the artificial airglow intensity was\ncorrespondingly higher.\nWe suppose that the variations of airglow intensity on\n15 September appear to be due to small variations of the\nsuprathermal electron density background, which are very\ndifficult to investigate.\n3.2 Regular northward displacement of the airglow patch\nAs was pointed in Sect. 2, a regular displacement of the 630-\nnm airglow patch to the north by several degrees from the\ncenter from the pump beam straight-line projection was ob-\nserved whilst pumping into the local zenith on 15 September\n2004. The displacement appeared during the fourth pump\ncycle (21:22\u201321:26 LT), when the western part of the double-\npatch was shifted by \u22485\u25e6 to the north, and existed during all\nsubsequent cycles. The displacement appeared simultane-\nously with an increase in the pump wave reflection altitude\nfrom 260 km to 280\u2013300 km. The magnitude of the displace-\nment was \u22483\u20135\u25e6 during 21:28\u201322:16 LT, then increased to\n\u22487\u20138\u25e6, again simultanously with an increase in the reflec-\ntion altitude up to\u223c340 km, then decreased to 4\u20135\u25e6, together\nwith a decrease in the reflection altitude down to 310 km.\nTwo possible explanations appear likely. First, the north-\nward shift of the heated volume may be due to refraction of\nthe O-polarized HF beam according to its group propagation\npath. Second, precipitation of accelerated electrons along\nthe geomagnetic field from a higher situated acceleration re-\ngion to lower altitudes where excitation of the O(1D) level is\nmore effective due to the larger density of atomic oxygen. In\nthis case the northward inclination of the geomagnetic field\nwould provide the patch displacement.\nTo examine these possibilities, we performed a ray tracing\nfor the prevailing ionospheric conditions obtained from iono-\ngrams during the experiment, and compared it to the optical\npatch positions. We note again that the accuracy of the iono-\ngram inversion is low due to strong natural F-spread. The\nresults of the raytracing in the magnetic meridian plane are\npresented in Figs. 5a, b. The solid lines show the paths of\nthe central ray and edge rays (\u00b16\u25e6 from the center) of the\nHF pump beam in the magnetic meridian plane, calculated\nunder the assumption of a horizontally uniform ionosphere,\nfor ionograms obtained at 21:09 LT (panel a) and 22:49 LT\n(panel b), respectively. Note that there was a systematic shift\nin the SURA antenna pattern to the south by \u22482\u25e6 for tech-\nnical reasons (Yu. V. Tokarev and A. N. Karashtin, private\ncommunication). The dotted lines show the straight-line pro-\njection of the HF beam onto the sky, the dashed lines corre-\nspond to the imager field of view, horizontal lines show the\nHF beam reflection altitude zr, where fpe(zr)=f0, the up-\nper hybrid altitude zUH, where fpe(zUH)=[f 20 \u2212f 2ce(zUH)]1\/2,\nand the arrows show the geomagnetic field direction. The\nschematic blobs in the panels correspond to the airglow\npatches obtained at 21:11:55 LT (panel a) and 22:47:55 LT\n(panel b), respectively. When drawing the airglow blobs\nwe assumed an altitude range of 225\u2013275 km. The airglow\nblob position in the south-north direction are shown in ac-\ncordance with the images, and include the area where the\nairglow brightness exceeds the average. In panel (a), where\nzr\u2248260 km, the patch is situated approximately in the cen-\nter of the HF beam at the upper hybrid resonance altitude.\nAt the reflection altitude, the center of the patch is shifted\nby \u224810 km (2\u25e6) to the south from the central ray due to re-\nfraction of the beam near reflection. The deviation is small\n(almost straight-line propagation) on the southern edge of\nthe beam; it is \u224810 km in the central part and \u224820 km on\nthe northern edge of the beam at the reflection altitude. In\npanel (b), where the ionospheric reflection altitude is much\nhigher, the deviation increases by \u22482 times. The projection\nof the optical patch onto the reflection altitude zr is slightly\n(by \u22486 km or 1\u25e6) shifted to the north from the HF beam\ncentral ray, while the northward shift at zUH is much larger,\ni.e. \u224820 km or 4\u25e6. At first glance this shows that the wave-\nplasma processes occur near the reflection point, namely ex-\ncitation of Langmuir waves or cavitons under parametric de-\ncay or oscillating two-stream instability (DuBois et al., 1990)\nprovide sufficient acceleration of electrons (Gurevich et al.,\n1985), which excites the oxygen atoms in the immediate\nvicinity.\nHowever, it is now commonly accepted that the optical\nemission source has a maximum at altitudes below zr, zUH,\nthe altitude of the plasma wave excitation and, therefore,\nelectron acceleration, when zr, zUH&270\u2013300 km. Model\ncalculations for the Arecibo heating facility (geographical\ncoordinates 18.48\u25e6 N, 66.67\u25e6 W, geomagnetic field inclina-\ntion 49\u25e6) by Bernhardt et al. (1989a), performed for the\nsource altitude of suprathermal electrons from 300 to 400 km\nfound that the red line airglow should come from the 270-\nto 280-km altitude, while for a source at 250 km the ac-\ncelerated electrons produce the excited states of the neu-\ntral atomic oxygen locally. Using multi-station observations,\nGustavson et al. (2001) found the maximum optical emis-\nsion to be 5\u201325 km below the pump wave reflection altitude.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/689\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 689\u2013700, 2007\n696 S. M. Grach et al.: On the location and structure...\nMid-latitude altitude estimates by triangulation Haslett and\nMegill (1974) show that the optical emission was limited\nin height to 280\u00b115 km, although the pump wave reflection\nheight could be up to 30 km higher. Kosch et al. (2002a)\nestimated the altitude of the airglow generation to be &200\u2013\n220 km, while the reflection and upper hybrid altitudes were\n30\u201350 km higher. Using this information, we place schemat-\nically the airglow blob at 225\u2013270 km altitude. Additional\narguments for the placement of the blob below the interac-\ntion region are stated in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4. The downward\nshift of the optical emission source from the pump-plasma in-\nteraction altitude (either reflection or upper hybrid altitudes)\nis conditioned by precipitation of the accelerated electrons\nalong the geomagnetic field to lower altitudes with a higher\ndensity of atomic oxygen.\nIf we project the optical blob along the geomagnetic field\nline in panel (b) of Fig. 5, it will coincide approximately\nwith the central part of the HF beam at the upper hybrid res-\nonance altitude zUH. On the other hand, a magnetic field-\naligned projection of the central part of the HF beam, which\nintersects with the reflection level, down to the altitude of\nthe schematic blob, will be shifted by 10\u201340 km (2\u201310\u25e6) fur-\nther to the north from the center of the visible patch position.\nThe same is true qualitatively for other pump cycles with a\nnorthward displacement of the patch. Therefore, if we as-\nsume the airglow to be generated mainly at the 240\u2013270 km\naltitude, we can conclude that electron acceleration occurs\nmainly near zUH, the upper hybrid resonance of the pump\nwave. For the ionogram inversion we used the lower bound-\nary of the ionogram trace. This gives the least northward de-\nviation of the ray group path. Any other choice of the trace\ngives larger ray deviation, a larger northward shift of the re-\nflection point and, therefore, a larger northward shift of the\nairglow patch, if we assume that electrons precipitate from\nthe reflection altitude. Similar joint analysis of ray tracing\nand the closest images for other pump cycles led to the same\nconclusion. Finally, the SEE temporal evolution and station-\nary spectra measured during the experiment were typical for\nones related to upper hybrid turbulence (Sergeev et al., 1999,\n2006).\nA northward elongation and northward displacement of\nthe airglow patch center by \u224830 km from the source of the\naccelerated electrons was observed at the Arecibo facility\nand attributed to an acceleration region from a higher alti-\ntude (Bernhardt et al., 1989b). The magnetic field inclination\nangle is larger at the SURA facility (71.5\u25e6) than at Arecibo\n(49\u25e6). This will give larger displacements at Arecibo, than at\nSURA, while our experiments show similar values. This im-\nplies that the vertical displacement is less at Arecibo than\nSURA. A northward displacement of the airglow patch at\nmid-latitudes was noted by Adeishvili et al. (1978). How-\never, they did not present any detailed analysis of the data\nand attributed the displacements to the group propagation of\nthe pump wave (our first option), which is hardly correct, ac-\ncording to our consideration.\n3.3 Temporal evolution of the airglow patches\nThe positions of the optical patches did not vary spatially,\nneither during the growth (\u201cpump-on\u201d) nor during the decay\n(\u201cpump-off\u201d) phases for the majority of the pump cycles (30\nout of 34 in total). However, during 4 cycles, from 21:26 LT\nto 21:40 LT, with the largest brightness in the center of the\npatch (Figs. 1, 3), the airglow patch started to appear at the\nnorthern edge of the HF beam and subsequently expanded\nmainly to the south, towards the center of the beam (see\nFig. 2). This phenomenon can be attributed to deeper pen-\netration of the precipitating suprathermal electrons to lower\natmosphere layers, down to 220\u2013230 km. Indeed, a station-\nary distribution of the suprathermal electrons through all al-\ntitudes below the source (z\u223c225\u2212300 km) must be formed\nduring the time \u03c4\u223c1\/\u03b4(\u03b5)\u03bd(\u03b5)\u223c10\u201315 s after the pump is\nswitched on (Gurevich et al., 1985). Here \u03b4(\u03b5) is the part\nof the electron energy lost by one collision, \u03bd(\u03b5) is the elec-\ntron collision frequency, and \u03b5 is the electron energy. Ac-\ncording to Sergeev et al. (1999), the characteristic time of\nthe source (i.e. accelerating HF plasma waves) development\nis faster than \u03c4 for the pump cycle used, but the image ex-\nposure time used is longer than \u03c4 . Therefore, already during\nthe first image after the pump is switched on, the airglow\ngeneration should occur under a stationary distribution of\nsuprathermal electrons. The larger (by 10\u201330 R) brightness\nobtained during these 4 cycles definitely indicates the pres-\nence of a larger density of suprathermal electrons in these\ncycles. Since the northward displacement is attributed to the\ndownward precipitation of the fast electrons from the source\nalong the geomagnetic field line, the appearance of the patch\nin the first image at \u22485\u20136\u25e6 from the center of the HF beam\n(upper left panel of Fig. 2), and by \u22482\u20133\u25e6 after 2 min of\npumping, means that the airglow registered in the first image\nshould occur 10\u201320 km below that in the central part of the\nlast image during the \u201cpump-on\u201d cycle. According to Gus-\ntavson et al. (2001), Fig. 8, the lifetime of the excited O(1D)\n(including quenching by molecular oxygen O2 and nitrogen\n(N2), ambient electrons and atomic oxygen (O)) is about 30 s\nat \u223c 220\u2013230 km altitude, increasing with the altitude. This\nmeans that the airglow should appear faster at lower alti-\ntudes, (i.e. further to the north), while later, when approach-\ning the steady state, the maximum brightness should cor-\nrespond to the maximum density of the excited O(1D), i.e.\nhigher altitudes (250\u2013270 km) and, therefore, smaller north-\nward displacements. During the relaxation phase (\u201cpump\noff\u201d time), the brightness should decrease, together with the\nmaximum density of the excited O(1D), i.e. at the same al-\ntitudes \u223c(250\u2013270) km, and, therefore, without any visible\ndisplacement of the patch. During the cycles with smaller\nbrightness, the density of the accelerated suprathermal elec-\ntrons at the low altitudes\u223c220\u2013230 km is, most probably, not\nsufficient to produce any visible effect for the camera used in\nour experiment. This issue can be better resolved by using\nan imager capable of higher temporal resolution.\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 689\u2013700, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/689\/2007\/\nS. M.

They look\nlike 0.2\u20131\u25e6 wide strips, 10\u201320% brighter than neighbouring\nareas with an angular length of about 3\u20134\u25e6 along the mag-\nnetic field projection onto the horizontal plane, and can be\nseen \u223c1.5 min after \u201cpump on\u201d until \u223c1 min after \u201cpump\noff\u201d (see Fig. 2). Similar structures were observed in optical\nobservations by Djuth et al. (2005) at HAARP and Sentman\n(private communications) at HIPAS. The field-aligned opti-\ncal enhancements exist due to the enhanced density of the\nO(1D), and therefore inhomogeneities also exist in the spatial\ndistribution of suprathermal electrons. According to our data,\nthe scales of the inhomogeneities across and along the geo-\nmagnetic field can be estimated as l\u22a5\u223c[z\/ tan(0.2\u20131)\u25e6]\u223c1\u2013\n10 km and l\u2016\u223cz\/[tan(3\u20134)\u25e6 cos(71.5\u25e6)]\u223c40\u201350 km, respec-\ntively, where z is the altitude of the airglow generation, and\nthe angle 71.5\u25e6 corresponds to the geomagnetic field decli-\nnation. According to Vas\u2019kov and Gurevich (1979); Gure-\nvich et al. (2005), inhomogeneities (depletions) of plasma\ndensity with such \u201cmid-range\u201d scale sizes1 appear due to\nself-focusing of the pump wave: the HF waves focus inside\nthe depletions, giving an increase in the pump wave power\ndensity and an enhanced level of the HF plasma waves, en-\nhanced plasma heating, and, therefore, further plasma expul-\nsion from the depletions, etc. The depletions are stretched\nsince plasma diffusion and thermal conductivity across the\nmagnetic field are strongly suppressed. In view of the above,\nmore effective electron acceleration, as well as precipitation\nof the energetic electrons along the geomagnetic field line,\nshould also occur inside the depletions.\n1\n\u201cSmall-scale\u201d irregularities, or striations, usually mean\nstretched depletions with l\u22a5\u223c0.5\u201350 m.\n3.5 East-west variations of the patch positions\nLarge-scale irregularities (l\u22a5&10 km) of both natural and\nheater-induced origin should also provide focusing of the HF\nwaves in the underdense plasma and guide the HF beam.\nHence, the airglow patches follow the motion of the large-\nscale irregularities. By using airglow images we can follow\nthe development of such large-scale structures and the inter-\nnal motions of the irregularities in the pumped volume of the\nionosphere (Bernhardt et al., 1989a,b).\nThe reasons for the regular northward displacement of the\nairglow patches and southward expansion of the patches dur-\ning pumping were discussed above. The east-west motion\nof the airglow patches have been discussed in several papers\n(Bernhardt et al., 1989a,b, 2000; Kosch et al., 2000, 2002a).\nAccording to Bernhardt et al. (1989a), the typical plasma\nvelocities obtained from both radar and optical observations\nabove the Arecibo heating facility, in January and February\nof 1987, were westward with speeds of about 20 m\/s. Usu-\nally the zonal plasma drift did not vary more than \u00b130 m\/s\nabout this value. At the Arecibo facility the star background\nmoves westward with a speed of 20 m\/s due to the Earth\u2019s\nrotation. In some observations, however, an eastward drift\nwith speeds up to 60 m\/s were obtained. Bernhardt et al.\n(2000) reported the eastward drift of the airglow patches ob-\ntained on 21 March 1993 above the SURA facility with a lin-\near velocity\u223c70 m\/s, increasing up to 120 m\/s during 2 min.\nUnfortunately, data on drift velocities during other phases of\nthe experiment were not shown in Bernhardt et al. (2000).\nKosch et al. (2000, 2002a) found no zonal drift motion of the\nairglow patches above the EISCAT heater. On 15 Septem-\nber 2004, during several time intervals, namely 21:10\u201321:20,\n21:54\u201322:20, 22:22\u201322:36 and 22:42\u201323:08 LT, the position\nof the airglow patches drift to the west with the angular ve-\nlocity of \u22480.63\u25e6 per 4 min (linear velocity \u224813 m\/s at 280\u2013\n300 km), i.e. together with star motion across the imager field\nof view due to the Earth\u2019s rotation. During 22:10\u201322:20 LT\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/689\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 689\u2013700, 2007\n698 S. M. Grach et al.: On the location and structure...\nthe westward drift was accompanied by a northward dis-\nplacement. On the contrary, during 21:26\u201321:40 LT, an east-\nward displacement of the patches by \u22481\u25e6 every 4 min was\nobserved (between successive \u201cpump on\u201d cycles), which cor-\nresponds to a linear velocity of\u224820 m\/s. However, east-west\ndisplacements were not observed for all 2-min \u201cpump-on\u201d\ntimes. As a result, we can state that in most cases the large-\nscale plasma structures (in which airglow patches are excited\nduring the pumping cycles) exhibit westward drift, with the\nsame speed as the celestial sphere (star background). This\ncan be easily understood if the large-scale structures do not\nrotate together with the Earth.\n3.6 Inclined pumping\nOur experiments with the HF beam inclined to the south were\naimed to check for the presence of the magnetic zenith effect,\nobtained at the HAARP and EISCAT facilities (Kosch et al.,\n2000; Gurevich et al., 2002; Pedersen et al., 2003; Rietveld\net al., 2003), at lower latitudes under SURA facility condi-\ntions. The amount of data obtained was limited by the clouds.\nFor the successful pump cycles, for both zenith angles of the\nHF beam (12\u25e6 and 16\u25e6, +2\u25e6 southward systematic techni-\ncal shift) the maximum brightness within the airglow patches\nwas observed at the same angle, namely 18\u25e6\u201319\u25e6 south of\nvertical, i.e. practically straight along the magnetic field line\ndirection. Ray tracing performed for the ionograms obtained\non 17 September shows that the central ray of the HF beam\nis displaced to the south, compared to the straight projection,\nby \u223c1\u25e6 at the upper hybrid resonance altitude, and by \u223c2\u25e6\nat the maximum altitude of the ray path, i.e. less than the\ndisplacement of the patch\u2019s brightest area. Unfortunately, it\nwas impossible to perform ray tracing for 18 September due\nto strong natural F-spread. To estimate the position of the\npatch and the HF beam path, we used the ionograms from\n17 September. The patch\u2019s brightest area appeared slightly\nshifted to the north in comparison to the central ray cross-\ning the upper hybrid resonance altitude. Detailed study of\nthe airglow patch structure for the inclined pumping requires\nfurther experiments. The appearance of large-scale struc-\ntures in the magnetic field line direction was obtained by\nTereshchenko et al. (2004), using satellite tomography meth-\nods which they claimed to be consistent with the theory of\nthe magnetic zenith effect (Gurevich et al., 2002, 2005).\n4 Conclusions\nObservations of the HF-induced 630-nm airglow performed\nat the SURA facility in September 2004 have shown the fol-\nlowing.\n1. A northward displacement of the airglow patch occurs,\nincreasing with the increase of the pump wave reflection\naltitude. The position of the patch can be explained con-\nsistently, if we assume that the electrons, responsible for\nthe O(1D) excitation, are accelerated near the upper hy-\nbrid altitude of the pump wave and then precipitate at\naltitudes of 240\u2013270 km.\n2. For pump cycles with the largest emission brightness\nin the center of the patch, the airglow started to ap-\npear at the northern part of the HF beam and expanded\nlater, mainly to the south, towards the center of the\nbeam. This can be attributed to a deeper penetration of\nthe precipitating suprathermal electrons to lower atmo-\nsphere layers, down to altitudes of 220\u2013230 km, where\nthe lifetime of the excited O(1D) decreases noticeably\n(till about 30 s) in comparison with the radiative life-\ntime.\n3. For some cycles, structures approximately parallel to\nthe geomagnetic field projection, corresponding to inho-\nmogeneities (depletions) of plasma density, with scales\nof 1\u201310 km across and 40\u201350 km along the geomagnetic\nfield, are seen in the images.\n4. In most cases, the large-scale plasma structures within\nthe airglow patches (>10 km) exhibited a westward drift\nwith the same speed as the coelosphere (star back-\nground). However, a slightly faster eastward drift\n(\u223c20 m\/s) occurred during \u223c15 min, together with an\nincrease in the reflection altitude.\n5. For 12\u25e6 S and 16\u25e6 S zenith angles of the HF beam, the\nmaximum brightness within the airglow patches was ob-\nserved to be practically straight along the magnetic field\nline, namely 18\u201319\u25e6 to the south of vertical.\nAcknowledgements.
