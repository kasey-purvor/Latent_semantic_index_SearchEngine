INTRODUCTION\nSHORT Er3+-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are attractive,low-cost, and compact devices for optical communication\napplications in the wavelength range of 1.55 \u00b5m. To increase\nthe gain per unit length along the typically centimeters-long\nfiber, high Er3+ concentrations are required. This requirement\nlimits the achievable gain due to the presence of Er3+ ion\u2013ion\ninteractions [1]. It is thus preferable to employ glasses that have\na small homogeneous upconversion coefficient, e.g., phosphate\nglass, as the host material for short EDFA [2], [3]. Another\nimportant requirement for short fiber amplifiers is to maxi-\nmize the pump absorption along the fiber and hence improve\nthe amplifier conversion efficiency. To this end, Er3+-Yb3+\ncodoped fiber amplifiers (EYDFAs) allow to increase the pump\nefficiency of Er3+ ions, as Yb3+ codoping provides an indirect\nenergy-transfer mechanism from the Yb3+ to the Er3+ ions.\nAlso, Yb3+ has a very broad absorption spectrum extending\nfrom approximately 850 to 1000 nm (compared with the more\nnarrow absorption bands of Er3+, e.g., at 976 nm). These\nproperties have led to the recent realization of efficient and short\nEYDFAs [4].\nAn important design issue for fiber amplifiers that operate\nin the multiwavelength regime, i.e., for wavelength-division-\nManuscript received September 8, 2005; revised February 1, 2006.

This consideration is of particular importance\nin access\/metro WDM networks where input signal channels\nare being added or dropped due to reconfiguration. One method\nto achieve automatic stabilization is to introduce a lasing chan-\nnel outside the signal bandwidth to clamp the length-averaged\namplifier population inversion and, hence, the gain [6], [7].\nIn considering the gain-clamping mechanism, one should take\ninto account that the fraction of clustered Er3+ ions can be\nquite significant in high-concentration fibers [8], [9]. This can\nrender gain clamping to be ineffective due to laser self-pulsation\ninduced by the Er3+ clusters [10]\u2013[12]. Yb3+ codoping can\nstabilize the lasing channel, as it increases the pump efficiency\nand counteracts the negative effect of Er3+ ion\u2013ion interac-\ntions [12]. In addition, the improved pump absorption in short\nEYDFAs allows to realize cladding-pumped fiber geometry\nwith higher output powers [13]. This can be useful for power\nboosting applications [14].\nPrevious theoretical works have studied the dynamic behav-\nior of low-concentration gain-clamped EDFAs, e.g., [15]\u2013[18].\nThe dynamics of gain-clamped EYDFAs was recently consid-\nered in [19], [20] both experimentally and with an approximate\nmodel. In particular, it was demonstrated that increasing the\neffective pump power or decreasing the fiber length can limit\nthe surviving channel power transients of relatively long (i.e.,\nmeters) gain-clamped EYDFAs. Our goal in this contribution\nis to further extend these works and to study the dynamic\ncharacteristics of short (i.e., centimeters), high-concentration,\ngain-clamped EYDFAs, operating in the gain-flattened regime.\nWe propose this configuration as a compact, cost-effective,\nautomatically gain-stabilized, optical amplifier for WDM metro\nnetworks, with transmission latency that is considerably smaller\ncompared with longer amplifiers. We demonstrate the effects of\nEr3+ clustering, and the effect of the Yb3+ concentration, on\nthe dynamics of such amplifiers. We also consider the effect of\nvarious important amplifier design parameters, such as the fiber\nlength, laser wavelength, pump wavelength, pump power, and\ncavity losses, on the dynamic performance. For this purpose, we\nemploy a comprehensive coupled propagation-rate equations\nmodel, which we have recently introduced [21]. Our model\ntakes into account the energy transfer between the Yb3+ and\nEr3+ ions, the presence of Er3+ clusters, as well as amplified\nspontaneous emission (ASE) in the vicinity of the signal and\npump wavelengths. The model assumes homogeneous broad-\nening mechanisms, and therefore, it does not account for the\nstatic contribution of the spectral hole burning to the dynamic\npower excursion [15].\n0733-8724\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In Section II, we briefly\ngive the main assumptions leading to the theoretical model\nfor the Er3+-Yb3+ codoped fiber, which was given in detail\nin [21]. In particular, we discuss the choice of model para-\nmeters. In Section III, we consider some numerical examples\nfor cladding-pumped, gain-clamped EYDFAs that operate in\nthe conventional band (C-band) of the Er3+ gain spectrum.\nConclusions are drawn in Section IV. In the Appendix, we\nintroduce a recursive finite-difference solution scheme for the\ndynamic spectral power densities propagation equations, which\ntakes in account the exact boundary conditions at the fiber ends.\nII. THEORETICAL MODEL\nWe assume a step-index fiber geometry of length L, with\ndistributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors on either side that\nprovide optical feedback in selective wavelengths for automatic\ngain clamping [7]. The light that is amplified and generated\nin the cavity, with spectral power densities P\u00b1Er(z, t, \u03bb) and\nP\u00b1Yb(z, t, \u03bb), due to transitions by either the Er3+ or Yb\n3+\n,\nrespectively, propagate in both the forward (positive) and back-\nward (negative) z-direction. It is assumed that the fiber is\nsingle mode at any wavelength in the vicinity of a signal wave-\nlength \u03bbs. The power that propagates in the radiation modes is\nneglected because it is much weaker than the power guided\nin the fundamental mode. Therefore, the coupling of the light\nfield with the fiber core can be described by the power filling\nfactor \u0393(\u03bb) of the fundamental LP01 mode. An approximate\nexpression for this parameter is derived in [22]. The pump\npower P+p (z, t) at wavelength \u03bb = \u03bbp is injected into the fiber\nat z = 0 and propagates along the forward z-direction. For\nsingle-clad fibers, we assume that the pump power filling factor\n\u0393p satisfies \u0393p \u0002 \u0393(\u03bbp). For double-clad fibers, we assume that\nthe first cladding geometry favors rapid pump modes mixing\nalong the fiber length (e.g., by placing the core offset the center\nof cladding) [23]. In this case, we might assume that pump\nabsorption is essentially uniform with an effective pump power\nfilling factor that is approximately given by \u0393p \u0002 Acore\/Aclad.\nHere, Acore is the fiber core area, and Aclad is the first cladding\narea (including the core).\nThe fiber core is uniformly doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ with\nconcentrations NEr and NYb, respectively. Our model takes\ninto account pump absorption by Er3+ and Yb3+ ions, forward\nand backward energy transfer, ASE, and scattering losses [21].\nThe model assumes physical clustering of Er3+ ions. That is,\nthe fiber core contains two types of ion populations, namely,\nhomogeneously mixed Er3+ and Yb3+ ions and a clustered\npopulation of Er3+ ions that are not coupled to the Yb3+\nions and therefore are not excited by the Yb3+ energy transfer\n[21]. The fraction of Er3+ ions in clusters is given by k. We\nmodel homogeneous and intracluster upconversion of Er3+ ions\nusing a quadratic term in the rate equations [24], with rate\ncoefficients C2 and C\u00af2, respectively (cf. Table I). We note that\nC2 depends strongly on the host glass properties [25], and\nwe assume that it increases linearly with the Er3+ concen-\ntration [2]. The cross-relaxation coefficients R61 and R35 for\nthe forward and backward Yb3+-Er3+ energy-transfer process,\nrespectively, are assumed to be of the same magnitude [26] and\nTABLE I\nPARAMETERS USED IN THE NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS\nto depend linearly on the Yb3+ concentration [2]. We note that\nthe existence of Yb3+ clusters and cumulative energy-transfer\nlosses to the Er3+ 2I13\/2 state can be significant in silica-based\nEYDFAs [27]. However, further experimental data are required\nto elucidate the relative strength of this loss mechanism in high-\nconcentration phosphate-based EYDFAs. To be on the safe side,\nwe restrict the calculations to relatively low Yb3+-Er3+ ratios,\ne.g., NYb\/NEr \u2264 5, so that every Yb3+ ion can be assumed to\nbe coupled to the nearby Er3+ ions only [28].\nThe model includes signal and pump scattering losses \u03b1\nand single-ion transitions between levels i and j that are char-\nacterized by wavelength-dependent emission and absorption\ncross sections \u03c3ij(\u03bb), as well as finite transitions lifetimes \u03c4ij\n[21]. We consider the ASE power induced by the 2F5\/2\u22122F7\/2\ntransitions of Yb3+ in the range of 900\u20131060 nm and the ASE\npower induced by the 4I13\/2\u22124I15\/2 transitions of Er3+ ions\nin the range of 1417\u20131649 nm. The propagation equations\nfor the Er3+ and Yb3+ ASE spectral power densities, and for\nthe pump power, are given by [21, Eqs. (11)\u2013(13)], whereas\nthe set of time-dependent rate equations for the homogeneous\nand clustered ion populations is given by [21, Eqs. (1)\u2013(8)].\nTo solve these equations, we divide the ASE spectrum into\ndiscrete channels of width \u2206\u03bb = 1 nm, whereas the width\nof a channel in the signal bandwidth is \u2206\u03bbs \u0005 \u2206\u03bb. Thus,\nthe signal power is given by P\u00b1s (z, t) = P\u00b1Er(z, t, \u03bbs)\u2206\u03bbs.\nWe assume throughout this work that the signal channels\nare injected into the fiber at z = 0, i.e., in forward pumping\nconfiguration. The following boundary conditions are imposed\non the lasing wavelength of the Er3+ spectral power densities:\nP+Er(0, t, \u03bb) =R1(\u03bb)P\n\u2212\nEr(0, t, \u03bb) (1a)\nP\u2212Er(L, t, \u03bb) =R2(\u03bb)P\n+\nEr(L, t, \u03bb).

The fiber core area is Acore = 1.96\u00d7 10\u221211 m2,\nthe numerical aperture NA = 0.21, the injected signal power P+s (0) =\n\u221230 dBm, the pump power P+p (0) = 224 mW, and the Er3+ and Yb3+\nconcentrations NEr = 3.02\u00d7 1026 m\u22123 and NYb = 1.96\u00d7 1026 m\u22123,\nrespectively [4]. Other parameters are given in Table I. The solid lines represent\nthe numerical solution, whereas the rectangles represent experimental data\nobtained from [4].\nHere, the terms R1 and R2 are the power reflectivities at z = 0\nand z = L, respectively. We assume that the DBR mirrors can\nproduce a very narrow reflectivity bandwidth, e.g.,\u223c 0.1 nm, so\nthat it is sufficient to consider a single wavelength reflectivity\nat the boundaries [29]. Thus, the reflected power represents an\naverage over the excited axial modes. To obtain steady-state\nsolutions, we employ an iterative procedure: integration along\nthe forward and backward propagation directions until the\noverall signal and ASE power densities are converged [21].\nFor the time-dependent cases, we use a finite-difference\napproximation with two separate grids, i.e., 1) one for the ions\nand 2) one for the photons, with the ions grid shifted by half-\ntime-step \u2206t\/2 and half-spatial-step \u2206z\/2, with respect to the\nphotons grid. The finite-difference approximations are given in\nthe Appendix, where we also describe the integration procedure\nof the equations with the given boundary conditions (1).\nThe validity of the model equations has been demonstrated\nin the case of continuous-wave high-power EYDFAs [30] and\nQ-switched cladding-pumped Er3+-Yb3+ codoped fiber lasers\n[31], with relatively low Er3+ concentrations and negligible\nclustering. To show the effect of clustering, we depict in Fig. 1\nthe small-signal gain of a 4.4-cm-long core-pumped, high-\nconcentration EYDFA. A similar configuration was studied\nexperimentally in [4] under continuous-wave conditions. We\nnote the excellent agreement between the experimental results\nand the numerical calculation for a wide range of signal\nwavelengths, provided that the fraction of clustered Er3+ ions\nis assumed to be k = 0.17. Smaller values of k tend to increase\nthe gain in the entire bandwidth of the signal wavelengths.\nIII. EXAMPLES\nIn this section, we consider a set of examples for cladding-\npumped, gain-clamped, C-band EYDFA near the 976-nm pump\ntransition. Unless otherwise stated, we assume that the parame-\nters for the calculations are given in Table I. These parameters\ncorrespond to an efficient phosphate-based Er3+-Yb3+\ncodoped fiber. The input signal band consists of ten equally\nspaced spectral channels in the range 1544\u20131562 nm, with\nwidth \u2206\u03bbs = 0.375 pm. This choice is based on the theoretical\ngain spectrum of Er3+ in phosphate glass, which shows that\nthe gain ripple (cf. Fig. 1) can be minimized by properly\nselecting the amplifier parameters (e.g., pump power and fiber\nlength) to achieve a particular average population inversion.\nIt is assumed that the input pump power is P+p (0) = 2 W,\nwhereas the total input power of the signal is P totals = 0 dBm,\nequally distributed among the signal channels. We assume that\nthe Bragg gratings select the lasing wavelength at 1586 nm.\nThe power reflectivities of the DBR mirrors are R1 = 0.98\nand R2 = 0.04 at z = 0 and z = L, respectively. Note that R2\nshould be selected small enough to provide high gain for the\nsignal while maintaining stable gain-clamping conditions.\nIn what follows, we consider the effect of dropping or adding\nnine out of the ten signal channels from an initial steady-\nstate regime. We assume that the signal power decreases (or\nincreases) instantaneously, as this constitutes the worst case\nfailures in WDM network amplifiers [16]. To this end, the\nsteady-state solutions are used as the initial conditions for the\nsubsequent time evolution.\nThe amount of Er3+ clustering in high-concentration Er3+-\nYb3+ codoped fibers is somewhat ambiguous. In principle,\nit depends on several factors, e.g., the Er3+ and Yb3+ con-\ncentrations, and the fiber processing. In particular, high Er3+\nconcentration and low Yb3+-Er3+ ratio favor Er3+ clustering\n[28]. To illustrate the effect of Er3+ clustering on the dynamics\nof gain-clamped EYDFAs, we depict in Fig. 2 the transient\nresponse of a surviving channel (\u03bbs = 1562 nm) when nine\nchannels are dropped at t = 0 from initial steady-state con-\nditions. When the signal channels are dropped, the surviving\nchannel output power exhibits transient power excursions due\nto the relaxation oscillation in the lasing channel [15]. We note\nthat in the limit of negligible amounts of clustered Er3+ ions\n(e.g., k \u0002 0), the power transients damp into a constant steady\nstate after a few hundred microseconds. Thus, the dynamic\nbehavior is similar to low-concentration gain-clamped EDFA\n[15]\u2013[18], but with typically smaller power excursions. With in-\ncreased amount of Er3+ clustering, the period of the relaxation\noscillation increases, and there is no oscillations\u2019 damping. In\nfact, there is a limiting value of k, kcr \u0002 0.1, for achieving\ndamped oscillations in the laser and the surviving signal output\npower. For values of k higher than this value, e.g., k = 0.14, the\namplitude of the oscillations in the laser power increases with\ntime [10], and self-pulsation in the signal power is generated\n[see Fig. 2(a)]. We note that the pumping process builds up\nthe inversion of the homogeneous Er3+ average population\nbetween successive pulses [see Fig. 2(b)], whereas the inver-\nsion of the clustered Er3+ ions becomes depleted in this time\ninterval. Thus, self-pulsation in the signal power is established\nfor effective pumping rates too weak to counteract the fast\nupconversion process in the clustered Er3+ ions during the laser\nchannel relaxation oscillation. It is worth to mention, however,\nthat although an increased amount of Er3+ in clusters wastes\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Transient response of (a) the \u03bbs = 1562 nm channel output power\nand (b) the normalized length-averaged inversion of the homogeneous Er3+\npopulation (left side) and the clustered Er3+ population (right side). Here, nine\nout of ten channels are dropped at t = 0 from initially steady state, for two\ndifferent relative number of Er3+ ions in clusters (k). The Yb3+-Er3+ ratio\nis NYb\/NEr = 1, and the fiber length is L = 16.5 cm, for which the gain is\napproximately flat.\nthe laser power, and therefore reduces the lasing efficiency,\nclustering has only a small effect on the amplifier characteristics\n(e.g., the signal gain, gain flatness, and noise figure) because the\noverall Er3+ population inversion is approximately fixed.\nFig. 3 depicts the transient response of the channel at \u03bbs =\n1562 nm when channels are added at t = 0 to an initial steady-\nstate regime. Here, we also note the similarity between the\ndynamic behavior of nonclustered gain-clamped EYDFA and\nthe low-concentration gain-clamped EDFA [15]\u2013[18]. The am-\nplification process of the signal saturates the homogeneous\nEr3+ inverted population below the threshold value, and the\nrecovery time of the signal power undershoot depends on the\npump efficiency [17]. Increasing the number of clustered Er3+\nions also increases absorption losses. This, in turn, increases the\nundershoot in the signal output power [see Fig. 3(a)]. In fact, we\nnote that for the k \u0002 0.15 case, the pumping process rebuilds\nthe average inversion of the homogeneous Er3+ ion popula-\ntion toward the laser threshold [see Fig. 3(b)], and the \u03bbs =\n1562 nm channel power relaxes toward a constant steady-state\nregime only after several tens of microseconds. We conclude\nthat clustered Er3+ ions act as a distributed saturable absorber\nthat inhibits stable gain-clamping conditions if the clustering\nratio is too high and the pump power is not strong enough.\nFor example, the delay in the onset of relaxation oscillation\nFig. 3. Same as Fig. 2 when nine channels are added at t = 0 from initially\nsteady state.

The Yb3+ concentration\nhas only a small effect on the Er3+ population inversion and\nhence on the static gain-clamped amplifier characteristics, e.g.,\nthe gain flatness. However, the dynamic behavior of high-\nconcentration gain-clamped EYDFAs depends strongly on the\nvalue of the Yb3+ concentration. Fig. 4 depicts the transient\nresponse of the \u03bbs = 1562 nm channel output power when\nchannels are (a) dropped and (b) added at t = 0 from an\ninitial steady-state regime. Here, different Yb3+-Er3+ ratios are\nassumed for k = 0.17 clustering. For a relatively small Yb3+-\nEr3+ ratio (e.g., NYb\/NEr = 1.5), the power in the surviving\nchannel following channels\u2019 removal shows steady oscillations\nwithout damping [cf. Fig. 4(a)]. On increasing the Yb3+ con-\ncentration, the effective pumping rate also increases, and the\noscillation period decreases with time. For the given k, there\nis a limiting value of Yb3+-Er3+ ratio (NYb\/NEr)cr \u0002 2.6 for\nwhich the transient behavior changes from nondamping oscilla-\ntions into damped oscillations. For sufficiently high Yb3+-Er3+\nratio, e.g., NYb\/NEr = 5, the relaxation oscillation in the laser\nchannel are strongly damped, resulting in constant output power\nof the surviving signal within few hundred microseconds. We\nalso note that for high Yb3+ concentrations, the inverted ions\npopulation increases near z = 0, with increased reabsorption\nlosses.

There exists\na fiber length for which this amplitude is the smallest one.\nThis particular length is different for the drop and add cases.\nFor shorter or longer fiber lengths, the compensating laser\npower becomes smaller, and the laser oscillations deplete the\ninverted population of Er3+ ions more efficiently upon channel\nFig. 5.

We note that the dynamic response of a fiber with\nlengths from L \u0002 8 cm (lower limit for laser threshold) to\nL \u0002 17.5 cm is acceptable, as the amplitude of power ex-\ncursions is less than a fraction of decibel in both the add\nand drop cases [15]. In particular, the dynamic response of\na fiber with a flattest gain (L \u0002 16.5 cm) allows accept-\nable compromise between flatness and dynamic performance\nwhen designing high-concentration gain-clamped EYDFAs.\nThe relatively small amplitude of the power excursions demon-\nstrated in Fig. 6 is a consequence of the high Er3+ concen-\ntration assumed in our calculations. If one assumes a lower\nEr3+ concentration, e.g., NEr = 4\u00d7 1026 m\u22123, one obtains\ndifferent minimum power excursions amplitude \u223c 0.12 dB,\nwith fiber length of L \u0002 19 cm, in the drop case. We also\nnote that the increase in the power excursions in longer fiber\nlengths is more significant in the add case than in the drop case.\nIn particular, for fibers longer than L \u0002 20 cm, reabsorption\nlosses become significant, and stable gain-clamping conditions\ncannot be obtained without additional increase in the pump\npower. For such long fibers, the delay in the onset of relaxation\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on June 15, 2009 at 05:09 from IEEE Xplore.

The solid line represents a\nB-spline interpolation to the exact numerical solution.\noscillation is much bigger than the oscillations period (\u2206toc >\n3Toc), so that the contribution of the initial signal undershoot\nto the amplitude of power excursions becomes dominant. The\ndependence of the relaxation oscillation frequency on the fiber\nlength is an interplay between the average gain, propagation\ntime, lasing power, and saturation power [18]. In particular,\non increasing the fiber length, the average inversion along\nthe fiber (and hence the average gain) decreases, whereas the\nround-trip time of propagation in the cavity increases. Thus,\nthe average relaxation oscillation frequency of the surviving\nchannel decreases on sufficiently increasing the fiber length\n[18]. Furthermore, it is higher in the drop case than in the add\ncase, in agreement with the results for low-concentration gain-\nclamped EDFAs [15], [17].\nIn the next examples we consider EYDFA with optimal\nlength, i.e., for which the gain flatness is maximized [21]. Fig. 7\nshows the effect of the feedback laser wavelength on both the\nASE-induced worst channel noise figure [36] and the amplitude\nof the power excursions. The noise figure dependence on the\nlaser wavelength is a consequence of both the signal gain\nand the amount of ASE propagating in the signal band. In\nparticular, the ASE power depends on the spatial variation of\nthe population inversion along the fiber length [36]. The noise\nfigure is higher at shorter laser wavelengths, where the power\nof the compensating laser is stronger, and is nearly constant\nfor longer wavelengths, i.e., for \u03bb > 1575 nm. On the other\nhand, the amplitude of the power excursions depends mainly\non the spectral properties of the gain and generally increases at\nthe longer laser wavelengths. In particular, on increasing the\nlasing wavelength, the lasing process becomes less efficient\ndue to the decrease in the Er3+ emission cross section. Also,\nreabsorption due to excess of Er3+ clusters becomes weaker,\nwhich increases kcr and stabilizes gain-clamping conditions.\nWe conclude that choosing a laser wavelength in the spectral\nrange from \u03bb \u0002 1594 nm to \u03bb \u0002 1600 nm allows minimum\namplitude of power excursions in both the add and drop cases,\nwith acceptable noise figure performance.\nThe effect of the Yb3+ concentration on the dynamics of\ngain-clamped EYDFA is further illustrated in Fig. 8. Here, we\nFig. 8.

The solid\nline represents a B-spline interpolation to the exact numerical solution.\nshow the dependence of the dynamic parameters on the pump\nwavelength for two values of Yb3+ concentrations. In the drop\ncase, the amplitude of power excursions is generally smaller\nnear the peak Er3+ and Yb3+ absorption band, i.e., around\n\u03bbp = 976 nm [Fig. 8(a)]. On the other hand, in the add case,\nthe amplitude generally increases at \u03bbp = 976 nm in the limit\nof large Yb3+-Er3+ ratio [Fig. 8(b)]. The amplitude increase is\nsubstantial at shorter pump wavelengths in the limit of smaller\nYb3+-Er3+ ratios. In this case, less efficient pump absorption\nalong the fiber, and hence, larger reabsorption losses result in\nincreased contribution of the initial signal power undershoot to\nthe excursions amplitude. Furthermore, under these conditions,\nkcr is smaller, and gain-clamping becomes unstable in the\npresence of excess Er3+ clustering. We also note that for both\nthe add and drop cases, the relaxation oscillation frequency\nhas a maximum close to \u03bbp \u0002 976 nm and that the frequency\nof oscillations increases on employing higher Yb3+-Er3+ ra-\ntio. Thus, short fibers with high Yb3+ concentration allow\nmore stable gain-clamping conditions over a somewhat broader\npumping bandwidth, with reduced sensitivity of the power\nexcursion to variations in the pump wavelength compared with\ngain-clamped EDFAs. It is worth mentioning, however, that in\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on June 15, 2009 at 05:09 from IEEE Xplore.

These important\ndesign parameters allow extending the dynamic range of input\nsignal powers for which particular gain-clamping conditions\ncan be achieved. On decreasing the output mirror reflectivity\nat the laser wavelength from R2 = 0.04 to R2 = 0.02, the\nsignal amplification becomes more efficient, and the average\ngain increases from \u223c 19 to \u223c 23 dB, respectively. However,\nincreasing the losses also increases the length of a gain-flattened\nfiber to \u223c 20 cm, and the threshold pump power for achieving\ngain-clamping conditions increases from P+p (0) \u0002 0.7 W to\nP+p (0) \u0002 1.8 W, respectively. For weak pumping just above the\nthreshold, the power excursions are more severe, in particular,\nfor mirror reflectivityR2 = 0.02, where the amplitude of power\nexcursions can be as high as\u223c 0.18 dB. On increasing the pump\npower, the amplitude of power excursions decreases, and the\nrelaxation oscillation frequency increases. In conclusion, we\nnote that the effect of increasing the pump power is similar\nto increasing the Yb3+ concentration, i.e., it increases kcr\nand, hence, suppresses self-pulsation in the presence of excess\nEr3+ clustering. However, because pumping of Er3+ is mainly\nindirect, the effect of pumping in suppressing self-pulsation\ndepends heavily on the Yb3+-Er3+ energy-transfer efficiency.\nFurthermore, increasing the pump power reduces the signal\nconversion efficiency because the gain is fixed.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nTime-dependent rate-propagation equations were used to\nstudy the dynamic features of high-concentration gain-clamped\nshort EYDFAs, operating in the gain-flattened regime. Our\nresults suggest that centimeters-long EYDFAs are attractive\ncandidates for reconfigurable WDM networks, provided that\nthe number of Er3+ ions in clusters is kept small. In particular,\nwe demonstrated that the amplitude of power excursions in\nthe surviving channel is typically small, e.g., less than 0.1 dB,\nfor a wide range of practical operating conditions. These\npower excursions are much smaller than the corresponding\nfigures in conventional gain-clamped EDFAs [15]\u2013[18] and\nrelatively long gain-clamped EYDFAs [19], [20]. Also, po-\nlarization effects are expected to be considerably smaller in\ncircular, short EYDFAs compared with the recently proposed\nhigh-concentration Er3+-doped waveguide amplifiers for simi-\nlar WDM applications [37]. We suggest that further engineering\nof the glass host properties may extend the gain bandwidth of\nshort EYDFAs.\nWe have shown that the noise penalty due to gain-clamping\nbecomes smaller on selecting a feedback laser channel with\nwavelength sufficiently longer than the WDM signal band-\nwidth, i.e., \u03bb > 1575 nm. On the other hand, increasing the\nlaser wavelength also increases the amplitude of the dynamic\npower excursions, in particular in the add case.\nThe dynamic characteristics of the relaxation oscillations in\nthe surviving signal are strongly dependent on the effective\npumping rate of the Er3+ ions and on the degree of Er3+\nclustering. In particular, a high number of Er3+ ions in clusters\nresult in unstable gain-clamping conditions. This instability is\ncharacterized by undamped oscillations of the surviving signal\nin the drop case and deep signal power undershoot in the add\ncase. Increasing the Yb3+-Er3+ ratio allows achieving stable\ngain-clamping conditions over a broader bandwidth of pump\nwavelengths, with lower sensitivity of the dynamic power ex-\ncursions to fluctuations in the pump wavelength. Furthermore,\nemploying higher Yb3+ concentrations increases the pump ab-\nsorption and reduces the period of relaxation oscillations. This,\nin turn, effectively suppresses clustering-induced nondamping\noscillations in the laser channel, provided that the Yb3+ con-\ncentration is higher than a certain limiting value that depends on\nthe degree of Er3+ clustering. On the other hand, reabsorption\nlosses become more significant, increasing the initial signal\noutput power undershoot in the add case. Thus, the optimum\nfiber length is a compromise between acceptable dynamic\nperformance and the efficiency of the pump absorption.\nAPPENDIX\nFINITE-DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATIONS\nThe rate of change of the spectral power densities per unit\nwavelength P\u00b1Er(z, t, \u03bb) that are emitted and amplified due to\nEr3+ transitions is given by [21]\n\u00b1dP\n\u00b1\nEr(z, t, \u03bb)\ndz\n=\n(\n\u0393(\u03bb)\n{[\nN2(z, t)+N\u00af2(z, t)\n]\n\u03c321(\u03bb)\n\u2212 \u03c312(\u03bb)\n[\nN1(z, t) + N\u00af1(z, t)\n]}\u2212\u03b1)\n\u00d7 P\u00b1Er(z, t, \u03bb)+\u0393(\u03bb)P0(\u03bb)\u03c321(\u03bb)\n\u00d7 [N2(z, t) + N\u00af2(z, t)] (A1)\nwhere dP\u00b1Er(z, t, \u03bb)\/dz \u2261 \u2202P\u00b1Er\/\u2202z \u00b1 (n\/c)\u2202P\u00b1Er\/\u2202t, and n is\nthe refractive index of the core. Here, the termsN2 (N\u00af2) andN1\n(N\u00af1) correspond to the excited and ground state populations of\nhomogeneous (clustered) Er3+ ions, respectively. The spectral\npower density term P0(\u03bb) in (A1) represents the contribution of\nthe spontaneous emission to the two orthogonal polarizations of\nthe guided mode [21]. To solve (A1), we assume equally spaced\nintervals along the z-axis with spatial points zj = j\u2206z (j =\n1, 2, . . . , jmax) and time points ti = i\u2206t (i = 1, 2, . . . , imax).\nWe use two different grids to discritize the photons and ions\nequations [21], which are half-step \u2206t\/2 and half-step \u2206z\/2\nstaggered in time and space, respectively. Thus, the spectral\npower densities (P\u00b1Er)i,j are defined at point (i, j) of the\nphotons grid and at wavelength \u03bb.

(A5)\nNote that for the polarized signal channels, we multiply the\nRHS of (A4) by a factor of 1\/2. Similarly, it is straightforward\nto obtain finite-difference approximations for the Yb3+ spectral\npower densities and the pump power, which have the same form\nas (A2) and (A3), but with modifications to (A4) and (A5).\nTo solve the finite-difference equations, we assume that\nthe terms Fi,j and Gi,j are all known for the row i of the\nions grid. Furthermore, we assume that (P\u00b1Er)i\u22121,j are known\nfor all values of j and that (P+Er)i,j\u22121 [or (P\u2212Er)i,j] is also\nknown. Under these assumptions, the numerical solution of\n(A2) and (A3) on row i of the photons grid starts from the\nboundary j = 1(z = 0) or j = jmax (z = L). However, in\ncase that both R1(\u03bb) \n= 0 and R2(\u03bb) \n= 0, e.g., in lasers, the\nboundary condition (1) is given in an implicit form. That is,\ne.g., at j = 1, we have (P+Er)i,1 given in terms of the unknown\nquantity (P\u2212Er)i,1. To express the boundary conditions exactly\nin an explicit form, we employ (A2) in a recursive manner for\n(P+Er)i,j\u22121, (P\n+\nEr)i,j\u22122, . . . , (P\n+\nEr)i,2 to obtain\n(\nP+Er\n)\ni,j\n= U+i,j\n(\nP+Er\n)\ni,1\n+ V +i,j (A6)\nwhereU+i,j and V\n+\ni,j are constants independent of (P\n+\nEr)i,1. Thus,\nin (A6), the term (P+Er)i,j is expressed as a linear function of an\ninitial guess (P+Er)i,1. A similar expression for (P\n\u2212\nEr)i,j\u22121 can\nbe derived from (A3), i.e.,\n(\nP\u2212Er\n)\ni,j\u22121 = U\n\u2212\ni,j\u22121\n(\nP\u2212Er\n)\ni,jmax\n+ V \u2212i,j\u22121 (A7)\nwith constant coefficients U\u2212i,j\u22121 and V \u2212i,j\u22121 that are indepen-\ndent of (P\u2212Er)i,jmax . Assigning j = jmax in (A6) and j = 2 in\n(A7), and using the boundary conditions (1), i.e., (P\u2212Er)i,jmax =\nR2(\u03bb)(P+Er)i,jmax and (P\n+\nEr)i,1 = R1(\u03bb)(P\n\u2212\nEr)i,1, we obtain\n(\nP\u02dc+Er\n)\ni,1\n= Q1\n(\nP+Er\n)\ni,1\n+Q2 (A8)\nwhere Q1 and Q2 are two constants independent of the initial\nguess (P+Er)i,1, and (P\u02dc\n+\nEr)i,1 is the new value obtained for\n(P+Er)i,1 after one round trip in the cavity. The exact value for\n(P+Er)i,1 satisfies (P\u02dc\n+\nEr)i,1 = (P\n+\nEr)i,1, and therefore\n(\nP+Er\n)\ni,1\n=\nQ2\n1\u2212Q1 . (A9)\nTo calculate the constants Q1 and Q2, we start with an initial\nguess for (P+Er)i,1, namely, (P\n+\nEr)\n(1)\ni,1 , and solve (A2) and (A3) to\nobtain (P+Er)\n(2)\ni,1 after one round trip and (P\n+\nEr)\n(3)\ni,1 after the next\nround trip. The calculated values must satisfy (A8), so that the\nunknowns Q1 and Q2 can be solved, and the exact (P+Er)i,1 is\nobtained from (A9). In particular, for (P+Er)(1)i,1 = 0, we find that\n(\nP+Er\n)\ni,1\n\u2261\n[(\nP+Er\n)(2)\ni,1\n]2\n2\n(\nP+Er\n)(2)\ni,1\n\u2212 (P+Er)(3)i,1\n. (A10)\nThe exact (P+Er)i,1 and the calculated (P\n+\nEr)\n(1)\ni,j and (P\n+\nEr)\n(2)\ni,j\nfrom the two round trips are used to find the exact (P+Er)i,j\nalong the fiber for all j \n= 1. To this end, we note that both\n(P+Er)\n(1)\ni,j and (P\n+\nEr)\n(2)\ni,j satisfy (A6), so that the constants U+i,j\nand V +i,j are known in principle. Again, for (P\n+\nEr)\n(1)\ni,1 = 0, we\nfind that for all j \n= 1\n(\nP+Er\n)\ni,j\n=\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n(\nP+Er\n)(2)\ni,j\n\u2212 (P+Er)(1)i,j(\nP+Er\n)(2)\ni,1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb(P+Er)i,1 + (P+Er)(1)i,j .\n(A11)\nSimilarly, because also (P\u2212Er)i,j\u22121 depends linearly on (P\n+\nEr)i,1,\nwe find that for all j \n= 1\n(\nP\u2212Er\n)\ni,j\u22121 =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n(\nP\u2212Er\n)(2)\ni,j\u22121 \u2212\n(\nP\u2212Er\n)(1)\ni,j\u22121(\nP+Er\n)(2)\ni,1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n(\nP+Er\n)\ni,1\n+\n(\nP\u2212Er\n)(1)\ni,j\u22121 . (A12)\nThus, using (A11) and (A12), we calculate the exact values\n(P+Er)i,j and (P\n\u2212\nEr)i,j\u22121 with the exact boundary conditions. We\nnote that if R1(\u03bb) = 0 and\/or R2(\u03bb) = 0, the whole procedure\nis not necessary because the power at row i is exactly known, at\nleast, on one of the two boundaries.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
