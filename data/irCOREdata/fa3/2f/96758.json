Further differentiation of the cells\nwithin these somitic segments leads to the formation of the\nvertebrae, ribs and other associated features of the vertebrate\nmusculature. Somitogenesis is one of the most well-studied\nexamples of pattern formation in the developing embryo and is\nbecoming, more and more, a leading candidate in developmen-\ntal biology for a study that aims to couple findings at a\nmolecular level with those at a cell and tissue level and lends\nitself openly to investigation from a more theoretical viewpoint\n(Schnell et al., 2002; Baker et al., 2003).\u204e Corresponding author.

At regular time intervals (every 90 min in the\nchick), a group of cells at the anterior end of the PSM undergo\nchanges in their adhesive and migratory properties and\ncoalesce together to form an epithelial block of cells known\nas a somite. Somites form in a strict AP sequence (Gossler and\nHrab\u011b de Angelis, 1998; Stickney et al., 2000; Stockdale et al.,\n2000), and budding of cells from the anterior part of the PSM\ncompensates for the addition of cells at the posterior end of\nthe PSM as the body axis lengthens. In this way, the PSM\ntravels down the AP axis, remaining approximately constant in\nlength throughout the process of segmentation and a wave of\ncell determination appears to sweep along the AP axis behind\nthe PSM, leaving somites in its wake (Collier et al., 2000;\nSchnell et al., 2002).\nSeveral genes are expressed dynamically in the PSM with\ncycling times equal to the time taken to form one somite\n(McGrew and Pourqui\u00e9, 1998; Palmeirim et al., 1997). For\nexample, during the formation of one somite, gene expression\nbands of c-hairy-1 and l-fng sweep along the PSM: expression\nis considered to arise as a result of a segmentation clock acting\nwithin cells of the PSM.\nFig. 1. An illustration of the vertebrate body plan during somite formation. The\nred blocks denote individual somites, the yellow blocks denote the determined\nregion of cells with its pre-pattern of somites and the yellow bands represent the\nundetermined regions of the PSM. There is a determination front at the level of\nsomite -V which divides the PSM into two distinct regions; the pre-patterned\nregion where the epithelialisation process has begun (low FGF8 signalling) and\nthe spatially homogeneous region where the cells are still in an immature state\n(high FGF8 signalling).\n117R.E. Baker et al. \/ Developmental Biology 293 (2006) 116\u2013126Another gene with dynamic expression in the PSM is\nfgf8. High transcription levels of fgf8 occur in the posterior-\nmost part of the PSM (Dubrulle and Pourqui\u00e9, 2004) which\ngenerates an FGF8 gradient with elevated signalling levels in\nthe posterior PSM decreasing in a graded fashion with\nmovement in the anterior direction (Dubrulle and Pourqui\u00e9,\n2002, 2004). As the axis elongates, the wavefront of FGF8\nmoves in a posterior direction so that signalling levels\nremain constant relative to the moving PSM. Cells move up\nthrough the PSM as development proceeds so that cells are\ninitially part of the region where FGF8 signalling prevails\nand begin to experience lower levels of FGF8 as the gradient\nrecedes.\nDubrulle and co-workers have shown that the different levels\nof FGF8 in the PSM coincide with regions of differing structure:\nin the posterior-most two-thirds of the PSM where FGF8\nsignalling is high, cells are arranged in a loose mesenchymal\nmanner, whereas in the anterior-most third where FGF8\nsignalling is low, cell arrangement has become more compact\nand the epithelialisation process underlying somite formation\nhas already begun (Dubrulle et al., 2001).\nBesides the obvious structural differences between tissue\nfound in the different regions of the PSM, there are also\ndisparities between levels of segmental determination (Dubrulle\net al., 2001). Determination refers to the irreversible commit-\nment of a cell to a particular developmental pathway.\nThe border which separates the two regions of FGF8\nsignalling is known as the determination front. It has been found\nthat \u201cFGF8 is sufficient to maintain the caudal identity of\npresomitic mesoderm cells and that down-regulation of FGF8\nsignalling at the level of the determination front is required to\nenable cells to proceed further with the segmentation process\u201d\n(Dubrulle et al., 2001). Fig. 1 is an illustration of the vertebrate\nbody plan during somite formation with the determined and\nundetermined regions clearly marked.\nPerturbation of the FGF8 signalling wavefront has been\ninvestigated experimentally by implanting a heparin bead\nsoaked in FGF8 alongside the PSM. FGF8 diffuses out from\nthe bead along the PSM, and the effect of this is to displace the\ndetermination front from its normal position. The result is the\nformation of abnormally small somites on the side of the embryo\non which the bead is grafted, extending for a distance of up to 6\u2013\n7 somites rostral to the bead with one abnormally large somite\nforming caudal to the bead such that the sequence of affected\nsomites falls back into register with the control side (Dubrulle et\nal., 2001).\nPrevious models\nSeveral models have already been suggested for somitogen-\nesis: Cooke and Zeeman's original Clock and Wavefront model\n(Cooke and Zeeman, 1976); Meinhardt's Reaction-Diffusion\nmodel (Meinhardt, 1986); and Stern's Cell Cycle model (Stern\net al., 1988; Primmett et al., 1988; Primmett et al., 1989), to\nname but a few. The models named above have been reviewed\nby the authors in Baker et al. (2003) and therefore we only\ndiscuss them briefly here.Cell Cycle model\nThe Cell Cycle model of Stern and co-workers (Stern et\nal., 1988; Primmett et al., 1988, 1989) assumes that cells are\narranged along the AP axis such that their cell cycles are in\nsynchrony. Cells in the anterior PSM being further advanced\nthrough the cycle than cells in the posterior PSM.\nSegmentation occurs when cells reach a certain time\nwindow in their cell cycle. A mathematical formulation of\nthe Cell Cycle model was first proposed by Collier et al.\n(2000).\nThe hypotheses underlying the Cell Cycle model are now\nwidely disputed. Palmeirim and co-workers have argued\nagainst the role of the cell cycle as a segmentation clock\nbased on the cycling times of c-hairy-1 in the PSM\n(Palmeirim et al., 1997) and the model cannot explain the\neffects of local application of FGF8 (Dubrulle et al., 2001).\nHowever, the mathematical basis of the model is that of a\nsignalling process, with control of the signal and its\nsubsequent actions being determined by external factors:\nwith suitable modifications, it can still be applied to study\nsomitogenesis.\n118 R.E. Baker et al. \/ Developmental Biology 293 (2006) 116\u2013126Reaction-Diffusion model\nMeinhardt's Reaction-Diffusion model assumes that cells\ncan be in one of two possible states, a or p, which correspond\nto the anterior and posterior phenotypes of the somite. The a\nand p states are such that they locally exclude each other but\nstimulate each other over a long range. Cells switch from one\nstate to another until they reach a stable state. In this way, a\npattern of stable apap\u2026 stripes is formed (Meinhardt, 1986),\ncorresponding to the observed pattern of division of somites\ninto anterior and posterior halves: each ap segment constitutes\na somite.\nThe wavefront of FGF8 provides the positional information\ngradient needed to generate the pattern, and further evidence for\nMeinhardt's model comes from the confined expression of c-\nhairy-1 to the posterior half of the somite (Dale and Pourqui\u00e9,\n1997). In fact, the Reaction-Diffusion model is the only one to\naddress anterior\/posterior somite subdivision. However, in its\npresent form, the Reaction-Diffusion model cannot explain the\neffects of local FGF8 application.\nClock and Wavefront model\nThe Clock and Wavefront model was first proposed by\nCooke and Zeeman (1976). The model postulates the existence\nof a longitudinal positional information gradient down the AP\naxis of vertebrate embryos, which interacts with a smooth\ncellular oscillator (the clock), to set the time in each cell at\nwhich it will undergo a catastrophe. By catastrophe, they mean\na rapid change of state, which could possibly be the rapid\nchange in locomotory and adhesive behaviour of cells when\nthey form somites.\nThe wavefront of FGF8 provides a likely candidate for the\nlongitudinal positional information gradient, and there is wide\nevidence for the segmentation clock. However, the model has\nnot been formulated mathematically. In this article, we employ a\nsignalling process similar to that developed for the Cell Cycle\nmodel as a rigorous framework for the Clock and Wavefront\nmodel.\nAims and outline\nThe specific version of the Clock and Wavefront model\nconsidered in this article is that proposed by Pourqui\u00e9 and co-\nworkers (Dubrulle and Pourqui\u00e9, 2002; Pourqui\u00e9, 2004a). Our\ngoal is to investigate the consequences of the interaction\nbetween the clock and the wavefront in response to experi-\nmental perturbations. We do not aim to model specifically the\nmechanisms underlying the clock nor the wavefront. However,\nwe note that the FGF8 signalling gradient along the PSM\nprovides a biological basis for a wavefront and the periodic,\ndynamic expression of genes such as c-hairy-1 and l-fng\nprovides evidence for the presence of a segmentation clock.\nIn the following section, we detail a \u201cword\u201d model which is\naccompanied by a mathematical formulation (see Appendix A)\nbased on the previous model of Maini and co-workers (Collier\net al., 2000; Schnell et al., 2002; McInerney et al., 2004). We\ndemonstrate that this new model can produce a coherent pattern\nof somites which are regulated both temporally and spatially.We then extend our model to include the effects of local\napplication of FGF8, presenting both a schematic view of the\nresulting anomalies and numerical simulation of the accompa-\nnying mathematical model. Finally, we present some experi-\nmentally testable predictions that may be used to verify the\nvalidity of our model and discuss the need for estimation of the\nparameter values involved in the model.\nA new Clock and Wavefront model for somite formation\nThe Clock and Wavefront model proposed by Pourqui\u00e9 and\nco-workers (Dubrulle and Pourqui\u00e9, 2002; Dubrulle et al., 2001;\nPourqui\u00e9, 2004a) hypothesises that there is some interaction\nbetween the wavefront of FGF8 and the segmentation clock in\nthe PSM that acts to gate cells into potential somites. For a cell\nat a particular point, they assume that competence to segment\nwill only be achieved once FGF8 signalling has decreased\nbelow a certain threshold. The threshold level of FGF8 is the\nlevel expressed at the determination front (Dubrulle and\nPourqui\u00e9, 2002).\nTo develop a mathematical formulation of Pourqui\u00e9's Clock\nand Wavefront model, we constructed a system of equations in\nwhich the segmentation clock controls when the boundaries of\nthe somites will form and the determination front controls where\nthey form. This is in agreement with Dubrulle and co-workers'\nobservations (Dubrulle et al., 2001; Tabin and Johnson, 2001).\nIn addition, we introduce the following assumptions:\n1. Once cells have reached the determination front, they\nbecome competent to segment by gaining the ability to\nrespond to a chemical signal and produce a somitic factor.\n2. At a certain time ts later, they become able to signal. ts is\nequal to the period of the segmentation clock, which is\ncoincident with the period of the cycling genes.\n3. Once a cell has reached the determination front, it will\nchange its response to FGF8; essentially, we will assume that\nit becomes refractory to FGF8 signalling.\nThis model is based on the signalling model presented by\nMaini and co-workers (Collier et al., 2000; Schnell et al., 2002;\nMcInerney et al., 2004): at a certain time, a small fraction of\ncells at the anterior-most end of the PSM will gain the ability to\nsignal, that is, they would have reached the determination front\nat a time ts previously. These pioneer cellswill produce and emit\na signal which will diffuse along the PSM. Any cell which has\nreached the determination front, and therefore becomes\ncompetent to segment, would respond to such a signal by\nincreasing its adhesion to neighbouring cells which are\nresponding in a similar manner, thereby forming a potential\nsomite. At this point, a cell has been specified as somitic, and it\nwill go on to segment and form part of a somite during\nsubsequent oscillations of the segmentation clock. The process\nbegins again once the new pioneer cells at the anterior edge of\nthe PSM become competent to signal. Emission of the signal is\ntransient due to negative feedback on signal production by the\ncells which react to the signal. This feedback loop results in\nperiodic pulses in the signal and hence the specification of\n119R.E. Baker et al. \/ Developmental Biology 293 (2006) 116\u2013126somites at regular time intervals. Fig. 2 illustrates the vertebrate\nbody plan during somite formation as envisaged by the new\nClock and Wavefront model. The interaction of the segmenta-\ntion clock with the determination front is clearly shown.\nIt should be noted at this point that the clock used in our\nmodel does not have an immediate correspondence with outputs\nof the segmentation clock observed experimentally by Pourqui\u00e9\nand others (Dale et al., 2001; McGrew et al., 1998; Palmeirim et\nal., 1997; Saga and Takeda, 2001). We do not doubt this large\nbody of evidence regarding gene oscillation in the PSM, and we\nexplore this point more thoroughly in the Discussion.\nThe mathematical model constructed from Pourqui\u00e9's\ndescriptive Clock and Wavefront model consists of a coupled\nsystem of three non-linear partial differential equations. The\nstate variables which the system describes will be a somitic\nfactor which is integral in determining the fate of cells (a cell\nwill only go on to form part of a somite once it has produced a\nhigh enough level of somitic factor), a diffusive signalling\nmolecule which is produced by the pioneer cells at the anterior-\nmost end of the PSM and finally a generic FGF8moleculewhich\nis able to confer the ability of cells to produce somitic factor and\nsignal (according to their level of expression of FGF8). The\ncomplete system of equations is outlined in Appendix A.\nWe know that whilst Hensen's node is regressing along the\nAP axis, cells are left behind and incorporated into the PSMwith\na certain level of fgf8which decays over time. FGF8 is translated\nby these cells and this creates the signalling gradient. We choose\nto model this complex phenomenon by assuming that FGF8 is\nproduced only in the tail and that it diffuses out from the tailFig. 2. Diagrammatic representation of the vertebrate body plan during somite\nformation within Pourqui\u00e9's Clock and Wavefront model. In the top part of the\ndiagram, the FGF8 wavefront is illustrated together with the position of the\ndetermination front. The middle section of the diagram shows the AP axis of the\nembryo with the somites (red blocks), determined region and its pre-pattern\n(yellow blocks) and the undetermined PSM (yellow band) clearly marked. The\nbottom part of the diagram shows the segmentation clock with the time t at\nwhich a cell reaches the determination front and the time ts later at which it\nbecomes competent to signal. The hollow yellow block marks the position of the\nnext somite to be specified: the posterior boundary is fixed by the position of the\ndetermination front at the time at which pioneer cells at the anterior boundary\nproduce a signal.along the PSM and undergoes linear decay (see Baker et al. (in\npress) for more details). The result is the formation of an FGF8\ngradient similar to that shown in Fig. 3(a). The FGF8 gradient\nmoves in a posterior direction along the PSM and confers the\nability upon cells to produce a somitic factor; at time ts later, they\ngain the ability to signal. Somitic factor production is activated\nin response to a pulse in the signal emitted from the pioneer cells\nat the anterior end of the PSM. Rapid inhibition of signal\nproduction by the somitic factor ensures that peaks in signal\nconcentration are transient and produced at regular intervals (see\nMcInerney et al., 2004 for further details).\nWe can anticipate the pattern of somites formed using our\nmodel by considering the progress of the points Pu and Pvwhich\nmeasure the times at which cells become competent to produce\nsomitic factor and signalling molecule (respectively). In a\ncontrol case, the determination front remains at a constant axial\nposition relative to the PSM and hence moves down the AP axis\nat a constant speed. Cells gain the ability to produce signalling\nmolecule a time ts after they become competent to produce\nsomitic factor. Therefore, the number of cells with the ability to\nsegment and the number of cells able to produce signalling\nmolecule increase at a constant rate. Fig. 4 illustrates the\nprogress of Pu and Pv along the AP axis and also the expected\npattern of somites formed. In this example, at t = 0, cells at x = 1\nbecome the next set of pioneer cells and also become competent\nto produce somitic factor. At time t = 2, these pioneer cells\nbecome competent to produce the diffusive signalling molecule,\nand they send out a signal. All cells between x = 1 and x = 2\nhave now reached the determination front and are able to\nrespond to this signal by producing somitic factor. These cells\nbetween x = 1 and x = 2 produce somitic factor in a coherent\nmanner, thereby committing themselves to form a somite\ntogether. It is encouraging to note from Fig. 4 that somites are\nregular in size and form at regular intervals.\nWe also solved our mathematical formulation of the model\n(see Appendix A) numerically using the NAG library routine\nD03PCF (see Appendix B for more details). Fig. 5 shows the\nresults of the numerical computation: the top panel shows the\ndynamics of the somitic factor, the middle panel shows the\ndynamics of the signalling molecule and the bottom panel\nshows the dynamics of FGF8. We see that the region of high\nFGF8 expression moves in a posterior direction along the AP\naxis with constant speed. A sequence of successive signals,\nmoving in a posterior direction, produces a series of coherent\nrises in the level of somitic factor which then enables cells to\nprogress to form discrete somites. We note, once again, that our\nmodel predicts a spatially uniform series of somites forming at\nregular time intervals.\nLocal application of FGF8\nEarlier in this work, we detailed the experiments of Dubrulle\nand co-workers regarding local perturbation of FGF8 in the\nPSM (Dubrulle et al., 2001). A source of FGF8 implanted in the\nPSM caused somite anomalies as a result of a disturbance in the\nprogression of the determination front. We incorporate this into\nour model by assuming that FGF8 is not only produced in the\nFig. 3. Numerical solution for the FGF8 profile along the AP axis. In each graph, the solution is plotted for t = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 (indicated by\narrows) and the hypothetical level of FGF8 marking the determination front is indicated by the dashed line. (a) In a control embryo, the position of the determination\nfront moves with constant speed down the AP axis. (b) A bead soaked in FGF8 is implanted at x = 10.0 resulting in perturbation of the determination front: in a region\nahead of the bead, progression of the determination front slows, whilst behind the bead the rate of progression of the determination front increases. The anterior end of\nthe PSM lies on the left-hand side (LHS) of the figure and the posterior end on the right-hand side (RHS). Parameters are as follows: \u03b7 = 1.0, Dw = 50, \u03be = 0.5, xb = 0\nand \u03d5 = 5.0.\n120 R.E.

Solving numerically the\nnew equations for the FGF8 signalling dynamics results in the\nFGF8 profile shown in Fig. 3(b). The dashed line indicates the\nprogression of the determination front, and we see that itsFig. 4. Illustration of the manner in which somites are formed in the new\nClock and Wavefront model. In the top diagram, the positions of successive\nsomites are found by tracing the lines as shown. The diagonal lines indicate\nthe positions of the points Pu (red) and Pv (blue). Pioneer cells, at x = 0, 1,\n2,\u2026 , send out signals, at times t = 0, 2, 4,\u2026 respectively. Cells which have\nreached the determination front are able to produce somitic factor (those\nbetween x = 0 and x = 1, between x = 1 and x = 2, etc.) and they do so in a\ncoherent manner, thereby forming a somite together. The bottom diagram\nillustrates the relative somite sizes. The reciprocal of the gradient of the lines\nrepresenting Pu and Pv is a measure of the speed at which somites are formed\nand the period of the clock is ts = 2.0. The anterior end of the PSM lies on\nthe LHS of the figure and the posterior end on the RHS.progression slows ahead of the bead whilst it increases behind\nthe bead.\nIn Fig. 6, we use the same method as before to plot the\npatterns of somites that could arise as a result of local application\nof FGF8. The top panel shows the results when a weak source of\nFGF8 (\u03d5 = 3.0) is implanted alongside the PSM: the lines\nrepresenting Pu and Pv deviate slightly from their control paths\nand the result is a series of slightly smaller somites forming\nanterior to the bead where the progression of the determination\nfront is slowed and a large somite posterior to the bead where the\nprogression of the determination front has increased. We note\nthat somite formation falls back in line with the control case\nwithin one or two somites distance posterior to the bead.\nThe middle panel shows the results of our model when a\nslightly stronger source of FGF8 (\u03d5 = 6.0) is implanted\nalongside the PSM: in this example, the anomalies produced are\nmore marked, and we see a sequence of 6\u20137 small somites\nforming anterior to the bead and a very large somite forming\nposterior to the bead. Once again, somite formation falls back\ninto register both spatially and temporally with the control\nembryo pictured in Fig. 4.\nFinally, the bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows the results of local\napplication of a very strong source of FGF8 (\u03d5 = 9.0). This could\ncorrespond to the source being implanted inside the PSM rather\nthan alongside it. This case differs from the others shown in this\nfigure as it results in a region of the PSM that will never segment:\nthe level of FGF8 produced in a region surrounding the bead is\nhigh enough to ensure that cells in this region will never have\nsufficiently low levels of FGF8 to reach the determination front\nand hence never be able to produce somitic factor. We see a\nsequence of small somites in a region anterior to the bead\nfollowed by a region where the cells remain unsegmented\nfollowed by a large somite posterior to the bead and then normal\nsegmentation.\nIt is encouraging to note that all three of the cases pictured\nin Fig. 6 have been observed experimentally (Dubrulle et al.,\nFig. 6. The progress of Pu and Pv as \u03d5, the strength of the bead source, is varied.\nThe red line depicts the progress of Pu and therefore the time at which cells reach\nthe determination front and become able to produce somitic factor. The blue line\ndepicts the progress of Pv and shows the time at which cells become able to send\nout a signal. The boundaries of the presumptive somites are marked by the\ndashed lines. As previously, the positions of the somite boundaries are found by\ntracing between the two lines. The anterior end of the PSM lies on the LHS of\nthe figure and the posterior end on the RHS. Parameters are as follows: \u03b7 = 1.0,\nDw = 10, xn = 0.0, cn = 0.5, xb = 5.0, \u03be = 0.2, ts = 2.0 and F = 0.5. See Baker et al.\n(in press) for more details.\nFig. 5. Numerical solution of the new mathematical formulation of the Clock\nand Wavefront model for somite formation showing the spatio-temporal\ndynamics of the somitic factor (a), the signalling molecule (b) and FGF8 (c). The\nanterior end of the PSM lies on the LHS of the figure and the posterior end on the\nRHS. Parameters are as follows: \u03bc = 10\u22124, \u03b3 = 10\u22123, \u03ba = 10, \u03b5 = 10\u22123, \u03b7 = 1.0,\nDv = 50, Dw = 20, xn = 0.0, and cn = 0.5.\n121R.E. Baker et al. \/ Developmental Biology 293 (2006) 116\u20131262001). Fig. 7 shows a typical numerical simulation of the\nmathematical model corresponding to the middle panel of Fig.\n6. Note the extra large somite.\nExperimental predictions\nIn order to test the validity of Pourqui\u00e9's Clock and\nWavefront model, it is necessary to make some experimentally\ntestable predictions. First, we investigate two of the more\n(mathematically) simple ways in which to perturb somiteformation: perturbing the speed at which the determination front\nprogresses along the AP axis and perturbing the period of the\nsegmentation clock. Using our model, we would expect to find\nresults in vivo similar to those seen in Fig. 8.\nIncreasing the period of the segmentation clock (whilst\nkeeping regression of the determination front constant) would\nresult in increased somite size: when the pioneer cells at the\nFig. 8. (a) Increasing the period of the segmentation clock (ts = 4.0) results in\nlarger somites. (b) Decreasing the rate of determination front progression (whilst\nkeeping the period of the segmentation clock constant, ts = 2.0) results in smaller\nsomites. The red line depicts the progress of Pu and therefore the time at which\ncells reach the determination front and become able to produce somitic factor.\nThe blue line depicts the progress of Pv and shows the time at which cells\nbecome able to send out a signal. The boundaries of the presumptive somites are\nmarked by the dashed lines. As previously, the positions of the somite\nboundaries are found by tracing between the two lines. The anterior end of the\nPSM lies on the LHS of the figure and the posterior end on the RHS.\nFig. 7. Numerical solution of the new Clock and Wavefront model for somite\nformation showing the spatio-temporal dynamics of the somitic factor (a), the\nsignalling molecule (b) and FGF8 (c). With a source of FGF8 implanted in the\nPSM, the somite anomalies are obvious. The anterior end of the PSM lies on the\nLHS of the figure and the posterior end on the RHS. Parameters are as follows:\n\u03bc = 10\u22124, \u03b3 = 10\u22123, \u03ba = 10, \u03b5 = 10\u22123, \u03b7 = 1.0, \u03d5 = 1.5,Dv = 50,Dw = 20, xn = 0.0,\ncn = 0.5, xb = 50 and \u03be = 0.5.\n122 R.E. Baker et al. \/ Developmental Biology 293 (2006) 116\u2013126anterior end of the PSM become competent to produce a\nsignal, more cells would have reached the determination front\n(consider Fig. 2) and become able to segment. This is shown\nin Fig. 8(a).\nDecreasing the rate at which the determination front is\nregressing (whilst keeping the period of the segmentation clock\nconstant) would result in the determination front moving a\nshorter distance during one oscillation of the segmentation\nclock than it would in the control case. The result of this wouldbe less cells gaining the ability to segment and hence smaller\nsomites. This is depicted in Fig. 8(b).\nThe third prediction we make is regarding inhibition of FGF8\nin the PSM. There have been some preliminary experiments to\ninvestigate the effect of inhibiting the FGF8 signalling gradient\nin the PSM (Dubrulle et al., 2001). Upon treatment with\nSU5402, a drug known to specifically block the kinase activity\nof FGF8 receptors, embryos formed with a large pair of somites\nat the level of somite -IV at the time of application of SU5402.\nWe can explain the formation of this anomalous somite by\nreasoning that the SU5402 treatment decreases the level of FGF8\nsignalling throughout the PSM, resulting in a posterior shift of\nthe determination front and an anomalous somite. SU5402 is\nrapidly degraded, and it is expected that FGF8 signalling is only\naffected during a time frame approximately equal to the time\ntaken to form one somite (Pourquie, 2004b). Degradation of\nSU5402 would result in an increase in FGF8 signalling activity,\nback to the original undisturbed level. We model this\n123R.E. Baker et al. \/ Developmental Biology 293 (2006) 116\u2013126mathematically by introducing a sink term into our equation for\nFGF8 which is active for a certain period and proportional to the\namount of FGF8 present in the PSM.\nWe can use similar methods to those used throughout the\nrest of this paper to estimate the anomalies formed when\nSU5402 is used to inhibit FGF8 signalling. Fig. 9(a) shows the\nanomalies produced when FGF8 signalling is inhibited for a\nbrief period: a large somite forms at t = 6.0 and normal\nsegmentation is seen thereafter. Fig. 9(b) shows the anomalies\nproduced when FGF8 signalling is inhibited for a longer\nperiod: a smaller somite forms posterior to the larger somite.\nWe note that, should FGF8 be inhibited for an even longer\nperiod, our model would predict the formation of a large\nsomite, followed by a series of normal somites, followed by a\nsmall somite and then normal segmentation.\nThe results generated by numerically solving the mathemat-\nical model are shown in Fig. 10. SU5402 is injected at time\nt = 8.5, and we assume that the effects last until time t = 9.5. WeFig. 9. Inhibition of FGF8 signalling results in somite anomalies. (a) Case in\nwhich SU5402 is assumed to act for a brief period (less than the period of the\nsegmentation clock). (b) Case in which FGF8 is assumed to be inhibited for a\nlonger period. The red line depicts the progress of Pu and therefore the time at\nwhich cells reach the determination front and become able to produce somitic\nfactor. The blue line depicts the progress of Pv and shows the time at which cells\nbecome able to send out a signal. The boundaries of the presumptive somites are\nmarked by the dashed lines. As previously, the positions of the somite\nboundaries are found by tracing between the two lines. The anterior end of the\nPSM lies on the LHS of the figure and the posterior end on the RHS. In both\ncases, the period of the clock is ts = 2.0.\nFig. 10. Numerical solution of the new mathematical formulation of the Clock\nand Wavefront model for somite formation showing the spatio-temporal\ndynamics of the somitic factor (a), the signalling molecule (b) and FGF8, (c).\nWith inhibition of FGF8 signalling using SU5402, we see the formation of a\nlarge somite at the level of the determination front at the time the drug is applied\n(t = 8.5 until t = 9.5). The anterior end of the PSM lies on the LHS of the figure\nand the posterior end on the RHS. Parameters are as follows: \u03bc = 10\u22124, \u03b3 = 10\u22123,\n\u03ba = 10, \u03b5 = 10\u22123, \u03b7 = 1.0, Dv = 50, Dw = 20, xn = 0.0, cn = 0.5, xb = 5.0 and\n\u03be = 0.5.see the corresponding decrease in FGF8 signalling throughout\nthe PSM in Fig. 10(c). The posterior shift in the determination\nfront as a result of SU5402 application causes the fifth signal\nand fifth somite to be generated early, and the fifth somite is\nlarger than normal. Rapid degradation of SU5402 results in the\ndetermination front re-assuming its normal position and\nsegmentation patterns returning to normal.\n124 R.E. Baker et al. \/ Developmental Biology 293 (2006) 116\u2013126Parameter estimation\nIn order to make quantitative predictions for the somite\nanomalies produced when FGF8 expression is perturbed, it will\nbe necessary to have accurate estimates of the parameters\ninvolved, more specifically, the rate at which FGF8 is able to\ndiffuse along the PSM and its rate of decay in relation to the\nspeed of axis elongation and, correspondingly, somite formation.\nIn experiments in which FGF8 is perturbed locally by\nimplantation of a bead alongside the PSM, it is uncertain how\nmuch of the diffusing FGF8 is actually able to enter the PSM\nand affect somite formation. Our model does not take this into\naccount, but it may be possible to match the anomalies seen\nexperimentally under different concentrations of bead source\nwith the anomalies produced by the mathematical model. In this\nway, it may be possible to estimate the amount of FGF8 entering\nthe PSM from the severity of the anomalies produced. Before\nthis can happen however, we need accurate estimation of the\nrate at which FGF8 is able to diffuse along the PSM and its rate\nof decay.\nDiscussion\nIn this paper, we have presented a revised version of\nPourqui\u00e9's Clock and Wavefront model for somitogenesis with\na mathematical basis derived from the models by Maini and co-\nworkers (Collier et al., 2000; Schnell et al., 2002; McInerney et\nal., 2004). We combine outputs from the FGF8 wavefront and\nthe segmentation clock to control the signalling process\ndescribed by the mathematical model.\nWe next moved to extend this mathematical model to include\nthe effects of local perturbation of FGF8. We represented a\nheparin-soaked bead implanted alongside the PSM by a\nconstant production term for FGF8, which is confined to a\nsmall region of the AP axis. In a similar manner, we solved the\nrevised equation for FGF8 expression numerically and\ndemonstrated the displacement of the determination front\nfrom its conventional path.\nIn both the control case and the perturbed cases, we were\nable to demonstrate the ability of our model to produce the\nresults seen in vivo; progression of the determination front\nalong the AP axis conferred upon cells the ability to produce a\nseries of signals with the centre of the pulse travelling\nposteriorly along the AP axis, leaving a series of coherent\nsomites in their wake. The control case produced a series of\nuniform somites and the perturbed cases a series of abnormal\nsomites with the intensity of the somite anomalies produced\nmirroring the severity of the disturbance in the FGF8 profile.\nWe also note at this stage that it is likely that the effects of\nlocal application of FGF8 via a heparin-soaked bead will wear\noff before all the PSM that would otherwise be affected by this\nperturbation can be gated into somites (Pourquie, 2004b).\nDecaying effects of local application of FGF8 could result in\npronounced \u201clarge\u201d somite anomalies as decay of the source\nwould confer the potential to become somitic to very many cells\nat the same time. The effects of a temporally varying local\nsource of FGF8 is something that remains to be investigated.The results of this work clearly show that perturbation of\nsomitogenesis leads to the incorporation of certain cells into\ndifferently numbered somites than their control counterparts. It\ncan be seen that such cells will go on to segment within a\ndifferent time step and will therefore experience a different\nnumber of clock oscillations before segmenting (Tabin and\nJohnson, 2001). Dubrulle et al. (2001) demonstrate that \u201cFGF8\ntreatment can increase the number of clock oscillations\nexperienced by PSM cells without altering their absolute axial\nposition in tissue. Cells which experience an extra oscillation\nbecome incorporated into a differently numbered somite and\nexhibit Hox expression indicative of a more posterior fate when\ncompared with contralateral control cells.\u201d Our model clearly\naccounts for this result (compare Figs. 4 and 6).\nLastly, we have chosen to simplify the clock: removing its\ncomplexity by modelling it as a signalling process. We note that\nthe clock present in our model does not correspond to the most\ncommonly observed somitogenesis cycling genes (Dale et al.,\n2001; McGrew et al., 1998; Palmeirim et al., 1997; Saga and\nTakeda, 2001), which have been widely accepted as constituting\nthe segmentation clock. Expression of such genes begins as a\nwide stripe in the posterior PSM: the stripe travels in an anterior\ndirection, narrowing as it moves, until it comes to rest in the\nnewly forming somite. However, genes such as l-fng and c-\nhairy-1 are readouts from the segmentation clock, and although\nthese genes and their role in somitogenesis have been widely\ndocumented, the mechanisms underlying the segmentation\nclock are still far from being completely understood. There has\nbeen some progress in modelling aspects of the clock (see for\nexample Lewis, 2003; Monk, 2003), but these are early models\nand we do not feel that incorporation of the mechanisms\nconsidered by these authors into our model would allow us to\nshed any further light on the aspects of somitogenesis\nconsidered here. It is for these reasons that we choose to\nsimplify the clock, removing its enormous complexity by\nmodelling it as a signalling process, with control of the somite\npattern held by a combination of this process and the FGF8\nwavefront. It is interesting to note, however, that recent\nexperiments of Ishikawa et al. (2005) have identified a gene,\nnkd1, which could be linked to our signalling molecule, v. nkd1\noscillates in the PSM with the same period as the other cycling\ngenes, but it is only expressed in anterior regions of the PSM.\nIn a sister paper to this (Baker et al., in press), we study the\nmathematical basis for our model in more detail. In particular,\nwe explain our reasons for modelling a generic fgf8 factor, and\nwe detail the simplifying approximations applied to the model\nused here that allowed us to predict the sequences of somites\nformed under local application of FGF8.\nFuture avenues of exploration lie in several areas. Firstly, in\ntrying to rework the model to use a mechanism better related to\nthe segmentation clock: the somitic factor could be linked to a\nnumber of genes, for example, Mesp2, but as yet there is no\nwell-established biological basis for the signal. One possible\nalteration would be to allow the periodic expression of the\ncycling genes to activate somitic factor production, but only in\ncells that have reached the determination front and therefore\nbecome competent to form somites.\n125R.E. Baker et al. \/ Developmental Biology 293 (2006) 116\u2013126The FGF8 wavefront provides the second avenue for\nfuture studies. It has recently been shown that retinoic acid is\nexpressed along the AP axis in a manner opposite to FGF8:\nhigh in the somites (anterior) and low in the posterior part of\nthe PSM (Diez del Corral et al., 2003). Findings suggest that\nthe FGF and retinoid pathways are mutually inhibitory and\nact to control somite formation (Diez del Corral and Storey,\n2004).\nLastly, it should be noted that Wnt3a has been postulated to\nplay a major role in somitogenesis: in control of the\nsegmentation clock via Notch signalling; and in control of the\ndetermination front via FGF8 expression (Aulehla et al., 2003).\nThis finding suggests a link between the segmentation clock and\nthe FGF8 wavefront and deserves further investigation.\nAcknowledgments\nREB would like to thank EPSRC for a Doctoral Training\nAward and Wadham College, Oxford for a Senior Scholarship.\nSS has been funded by the Research Training Fellowship\nprogramme in Mathematical Biology (Grant No. 069155) of the\nWellcome Trust (London).

The Heaviside function works like a switch: it is\nequal to unity when the bracketed expression is positive, and\nzero otherwise.\nThe dynamics of the spatially homogeneous equations\nhave been analysed thoroughly in previous work (McInerney\net al., 2004). Within a certain parameter regime (which is\ndetailed in the article), the system displays periodic pulses in\nthe signalling molecule as a result of non-linear interactions\nbetween the somitic factor u, and the signalling molecule v.\nThese periodic pulses in v lead to coherent rises in the level\nof somitic factor and the generation of a regular array of\nsomites.\nAppendix B. Numerical solution of the model\nWe solved the above system numerically using the NAG\nlibrary routine D03PCF, which is designed for non-linear\nparabolic (including some elliptic) partial differential equa-\ntions (PDEs) in one spatial variable. The routine is based on\nthe method of lines, using a finite difference approximation to\nreduce the system of PDEs to a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations in the time variable. The resulting\nsystem is solved using an implementation of the Backward\nDifferentiation Formula method. The independent variables\nform a grid: in general, the mesh consisted of 2001 \u00d7 2001\npoints, the output of which was plotted using the Matlab\nfunction imagesc. The accuracy of the numerical method was\ntested by both varying the mesh resolution and the error\nparameter of the routine (which controls integration in the\ntime direction).\nAppendix C.
