Towards an emotional geopolitics \n \nRachel Pain \n \nforthcoming in Progress in Human Geography \n \n \nAbstract \nThis paper questions the recent recasting of fear within critical geopolitics. It \nidentifies a widespread metanarrative, \u2018globalized fear\u2019, analysis of which lacks \ngrounding and is remote, disembodied and curiously unemotional. A hierarchical \nscaling of emotions, politics and place overlooks agency, resistance and action. \nDrawing on feminist scholarship, I call for an emotional geopolitics of fear which \nconnects political processes and everyday emotional topographies in a less \nhierarchical, more enabling relationship. I employ conscientization as a tool to inform \nthe reconceptualisation of global fears within critical geopolitics, and to move forward \nepistemological practice and our relationship as scholars with social change.  \n \nKeywords: fear, geopolitics, emotion, feminism, conscientization \n \nI.  Introduction \nIf the plethora of book titles in the early years of the twenty first century is anything \nto go by, fear is back in fashion (e.g. Bauman 2006; Bourke 2005; Furedi, 2005, 2006; \nRobin 2004; Schneier 2003). That this level of analytical interest in fear exists at this \nparticular time, and largely within the spaces of Anglo-American world, is not \ncoincidental, but relates to a series of contemporary events. Most obviously, terrorist \nattacks in the west this century1 and the war on\/of terror2 have sparked new interest in \nthe politics and patterns of fear. Other global (or at least deterritorialized) issues, \nincluding some that are seen as related to terrorism, have also figured highly in the \npublic imagination and on policy agendas. These include immigration and the threats \nit is perceived to pose to nation states; the possibility of deadly diseases which can \ntravel rapidly across the world; global financial crises; and environmental destruction \nand, potentially, catastrophe (see Beck 2002; Hartmann et al 2005; Hujsmans 2006; \nIngram 2008). The context which these \u2018new\u2019 threats have entered is generally \n 1\nregarded as a longer-standing \u2018risk culture\u2019 in western societies; the thesis runs that \n\u2018paranoid\u2019 or \u2018neurotic\u2019 citizens have become disproportionately anxious in everyday \nlife, encouraged by government actions, scientists\u2019 claims and commercial interests \n(Beck 1992, 1999; Furedi 2006; Isin 2004). While it is not usually analysed in detail \n(although Beck 1999, 2002 is an exception), it is the increasingly global nature of \nthese issues which is held to be ratcheting up both risk and fear and the government \nand individual actions and practices that are held to be resulting.  \n \nThis paper takes issue with this understanding of fear. I argue that a powerful \nmetanarrative, which I call \u2018globalized fear\u2019, is present in academic work and the \nwider public sphere. These literatures have generated important insights, particularly \nthe more critical and detailed accounts of the new geopolitics of fear which include \ncontributions from political geographers (e.g. Katz 2007; Megoran 2005; Sparke \n2007). However, the model of fear that provides the basis for these discussions is not \nalways reflective of the ways that fear is felt, patterned and practiced in everyday life. \nTo engage in this critique may inevitably seem to set up the global\/geopolitical and \nthe local\/everyday in a binary relationship, which is also the case in most of the \nliterature reviewed here. In contrast, the aim of the paper is to critique the ways in \nwhich fear is constituted within the new geopolitics of fear literature, to dismantle the \nartificial scaling it suggests, and to point to a more insightful and empowering \nframework for understanding fear in the twenty-first century that is far more attentive \nto what is happening on \u2018the ground\u2019 in the places and lives that people inhabit. To \nthis end, the paper draws throughout on recent feminist understandings of scale, \nglobal\/local processes and geopolitics, and suggests how these might be combined \nwith accounts of emotion. This provides one way of redressing the scaling-up of \nanalysis of fear that has gradually taken place in recent decades - not reversing it, but \nfinding new ways to refocus on different interconnected sites simultaneously.  \n \nFirst, some of the issues and themes in these new literatures on globalized fear are \nexamined more closely. Next, in a critique of this literature, I suggest that the \n\u2018globalized fear\u2019 metanarrative tends to constitute fear as omnipresent and connected, \nyet at the same time analyses it remotely, lacking grounding, embodiment or emotion. \nI then begin to outline what a call for an \u2018emotional geopolitics\u2019 might entail. I \nexamine three areas of existing literature: critical research on fear of crime, feminist \n 2\naccounts of globalization and geopolitics, and emotional\/affective geographies, each \nof which is largely ignored in the new geopolitics of fear literature. All offer relevant \ninsights, and help underpin a more enabling framework for understanding fear against \nthe backdrop of the war on\/of terror. I go on to develop one agenda for an emotional \ngeopolitics of fear that uses conscientization as a conceptual, epistemological and \npolitical tool. I conclude with some reflections on the separateness of various \ntrajectories of knowledge production around the geopolitics of fear to date.  \n \nThe literatures reviewed here use \u2018fear\u2019 in different ways; they variously analyse it as \nexperiential, discursive, and\/or political. What they have in common \u2013 and this \nunderlies geographers\u2019 longstanding and recently diversifying interest in fear \u2013 is that \nthey view fear as a social and spatial rather than purely psychological phenomenon. \nFear is defined throughout the paper as an emotional reaction to a perceived threat \nthat always has social meaning, and which may have a range of positive and negative \neffects on social and spatial relations.  \n \n \nII. Globalized fear? \n \nFew political spheres generate more fear and awe than the international. This is \nnot only the case with key events such as wars or terrorist attacks, but also \napplies to the very nature of global politics. Consider how conventional realist \napproaches to foreign policy, which revolve around nation states seeking to \nmaximise security, are in many ways political attempts to master and \nmanipulate the awe-inspiring fear of the international and the conflicts it \nengenders. \n(Bleiker and Leet 2006, 714) \n \nFeminist interventions question the disembodied masculinism of the [global] \nand interrogate the limits of local\/global binaries, calling attention to the \nsilenced, marginalized and excluded. In so doing, they observe that the local is \noften essentialized (Roberts 2004)\u2026the discourses of globalization \nhypermasculinized (Nagar et al. 2002), and many forms of knowledge and \nsocial relations effaced. \n 3\n(Mountz and Hyndman 2006, 446) \n \nBy \u2018globalized fear\u2019 I mean the powerful metanarrative that is currently popular in \nanalyses of the relation of fear, terror and security3. There are two senses in which \nthese metanarratives of fear can be considered to be \u2018global\u2019. The first is the idea, \nmore often implicit than worked through, that emotions are being produced and \ncirculate on a global scale: this has become prominent within much recent political \nanalysis of security and terror, including work in human geography. The second sense \nin which these explanations and processes are \u2018global\u2019 ones is that they tend to be \nprioritized and discussed as though they apply to everyone all of the time. In this \nsection, I want to examine these two propositions in more detail.  \n \n1. A scaled history of the analysis of fear \nLike the process of globalization itself, the metanarrative of globalized fear is not \nnew, but gathered pace as the century turned. The last thirty years have seen a steady \nwidening of the scale at which analysis of fear has taken place. The following brief \nhistorical caricature attempts to capture this scaling, though not all of the intricacies of \nacademic analysis of fear. In the 1960s and 1970s, accounts of fear tended to be \nindividualized and pathologized in social science (see Smith 1989 for a critique). By \nthe 1980s, much empirical emphasis was on the neighbourhood as a unit of analysis \n(e.g. Taub 1984). At the same time, feminist and other structuralist critiques became \nsignificant in diverting attention from individuals and environments towards the \nunderlying social and political structures which breed fear, as well as mapping in rich \ndetail the texture of fear in everyday lives (Crawford et al 1990; Pain 1991; Stanko \n1990; Valentine 1989). Critiques of moral panic and the governance of fear at the \nnational scale were also increasingly evident (Hall et al 1978; May 1988). Through \nthe 1990s, such analyses of fear as discursive - as a political and cultural tool used by \npowerful groups within nation states to meet certain ends - gained further ground, \nbecoming more prominent than empirical descriptions of the patterning of fear \n(Garland 1996; Lee 2007). In the early years of the twenty-first century, the idea that \ngovernments are increasingly manufacturing, drawing upon and reproducing fear (at \nleast, certain sorts of fears) has become the predominant focus of attention, though \nthere are different emphases and perspectives in the literature. The suggestion that \nscience and commerce have joined with public policy in encouraging a \u2018culture of \n 4\nfear\u2019, a risk-averse condition which stimulates negative reactions by individuals \n(Furedi 2001, 2006; Glassner 1999), has been eagerly taken up. Some go so far as to \nstate that \u2018public policy and private life have become fear-bound; fear has become the \nemotion through which public life is administered\u2019 (Bourke 2004, x). Isin (2004) \nargues that Anglophone neoliberal state societies are now governed through neurosis, \nresponding to and instilling fear in \u2018neurotic citizens\u2019. For Isin, the \u2018culture of fear\u2019 \nactually argument underplays \u2018the fact that people not only conduct their lives with \naffects and emotions but also in the absence of capacities for evaluating full and \ntransparent information\u2019 (Isin 2004, 220). Such political use of fear is certainly not \nnew, as Bourke\u2019s (2004) history shows (and nor is the outright dismissal of people\u2019s \ncritical capacities). However, many would agree that \u2018there is something new about \nthe specific architecture of fear that is now being crafted and\u2026the specific \u2018we\u2019 it \nattempts to craft with it\u2019 (Weber 2006, 684, my emphasis). \n \n2. Globalized fear in the social sciences \nSince 2001, a burgeoning literature has developed around globalized fear. In \nacademic and public discourses, fear has become primarily focused on issues of \ninternational reach, such as immigration, disease and terrorism, rather than the \nconcerns of previous decades with local everyday lives, bodies and places (Pain and \nSmith 2008b). In accounts of the new geopolitics of fear (e.g. Bleiker and Leet 2006; \nGregory and Pred 2007; Robin 2004; Sparke 2007), fear is drawn into geopolitical \ngovernance and conflict. It is the transnational dimensions of fear that are of interest \nhere: in this model, fear is produced and imagined rapidly and connectedly from one \nsite in the world to another, directed and channelled by political agendas. The \ntransmission between spaces and scales is often attributed to the mass media (Debrix \n2008), with certain culturally proximate events, such as terrorist attacks on the west, \nreceiving disproportionate ongoing attention because of their political and socio-\ncultural utility (Mythen and Walklate 2006). Indeed, the discourse of fear is so \nubiquitous that it is often linked to these before there has been time to ascertain their \nactual emotional impacts (Altheide 2003), and the media rarely specify exactly what it \nis that we actually fear (Poynting et al 2004). Increasingly, this applies to issues \nranging from panics about immigration flows to diseases such as SARS and avian flu, \nthough the core theme has been the war on\/of terror that has followed al-Qaeda \nbombings of western targets this century. Such risks, whether imagined, potential, or \n 5\nhappening now, enter a \u2018world risk society\u2019 (Beck 1999) in which the \u2018unpredictable, \nuncontrollable and ultimately incommunicable\u2019 consequences of risks increasingly \ncirculate at a global scale (Beck 2002, 40). According to Beck, it is not that life has \nbecome more dangerous. It is that risk is now de-bounded, in spatial, temporal and \nsocial terms, so that \u2018the hidden central issue in world risk society is how to feign \ncontrol over the uncontrollable \u2013 in politics, law, science, technology, economy and \neveryday life\u2019 (Beck 2002: 41, original emphasis).  \n  \nWhile the brief history of analysis of fear (above) reflects the dual trends of the \nscaling-up of analytical interest and the de-concretization of risk and fear, we might \nreflect that both fear discourses and its global-mobile nature have been with us in the \nwest for rather longer. Our colonial history provides a pre-condition as well as a \nparallel to these uses of emotion around a supposition of unbounded risk; present day \ngeopolitical events and relations both raise the stakes and provide further credibility \nfor widespread fear (see Ahmed 2004; Tolia-Kelly 2007, 2008). \n \nFor many scholars, the manipulation of fear is central to the \u2018feigning of control\u2019 that \nBeck speaks of, and especially prominent in analyses of the war on\/of terror. Fear is, \nof course, germane to the definition of terrorism, as it involves the use of fear as a \nweapon which is as intended to be effective as bombs. For example, from al-Qaeda \nstatements following the Madrid bombings in March 2004, \u2018if you don't stop your \ninjustices, more and more blood will flow and these attacks will seem very small \ncompared to what can occur in what you call terrorism\u20194; and after the London \nbombings in July 2005, \u2018Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its \nnorthern, southern, eastern and western quarters\u20195. The media have validated this \nsuggestion that western fears of terrorism are widespread (Altheide 2003). Such \nreports (or, more properly, unsubstantiated statements about fear) are, paradoxically, \ntied up with the nation-building that follows terrorist attacks, so that in 2005, \nLondoners were congratulated on their resilience and collective stiff upper lip, \nreminiscent of the \u2018Blitz spirit\u2019 of World War Two (Closs Stephens 2007), in \ncomparison with supposed mass hysteria in the USA following the New York \nbombings of 2001 (see also Smith 2002 on nation-building in the representation of \nterrorist attacks).  \n \n 6\nRecent suggestions from critical commentators that governments use these fears in \norder to justify domestic and foreign political actions are persuasive, at the same time \nas constituting, themselves, new constructed fear metanarratives entering the fray. \nHere fear and risk are woven together in particular ways, and fear has gained \nconsiderable currency as a way in which (geo)politics gets done: \n \nBefore 9\/11, Americans were supposed to be in Eden, idling in a warm bath of \nsocial autism\u2026Our fear of terrorism, orchestrated and manipulated by the \npowerful, is being used to reorganise the structure of power in American \nsociety, giving more to those who already have much and taking away from \nthose who have little.  \n(Robin 2004, pp 1-2 and 25) \n \n3. Globalized fear and human geography \nThe notion of the globalization of fear has, not unexpectedly, stimulated renewed \ninterest in fear within human geography, and from new quarters of the discipline. \nThese ideas about fear fit well with political geographers\u2019 interest in international \nrelations and critical geopolitics, as well as with related popular assertions about risk, \nlifestyle and the quality of life in the west in the twenty-first century (Beck 1999; \nFuredi 2006; Gill 2007). Since 2001, many political geographers have taken up \npositions in opposition to the war on\/of terror (Bialasiewicz et al 2007; Cowen and \nGilbert 2008; Graham 2001, 2004; Harvey et al 2001; Katz 2007; Mitchell 2002; \nOlund 2007; Smith 2002; Sparke 2005, 2007). Shortly following the New York \nattacks, Davis\u2019 (2001, 390) prophesy was that \u2018fear has a brilliant future\u2019, if \nAmericans\u2019 anxieties about personal safety and prosperity were to lead them to trust a \n\u2018revamped National Security State\u2019. Political and social geographers have since \ndemonstrated that the war on\/of terror has led, exactly, to repressive and unjust \ninternational and domestic policies (see the collections by Gregory and Pred 2007; \nand Pain and Smith 2008a).  \n \nThis work has focused especially upon the construction of imaginary and binary \ngeographies that underpin the new geopolitics of fear. Here, government and right \nwing narratives locate (white) western populations \u2018inside\u2019 the map of the nation state \nor Homeland, and the terrorist threats \u2018outside\u2019 \u2013 imaginary geographies which \n 7\nreproduce discourses about dangerous spaces and others, and are laid onto existing \nracial hatreds (Flint 2004; Sparke 2005). Alongside wider political science, \ngeographical work on the war on\/of terror spells out the oppressive consequences that \ntend to reinforce existing inequalities, for example Robin\u2019s (2004) careful analysis of \nshifting US domestic policy as having material consequences for Muslim Americans \nlocally. Fear is viewed as driving political actions, as well as being used and affected \nby them: \u2018responses\u2019 to terrorism such as the Iraq invasion by the US and its allies are \ndriven by powerful emotions and the overwhelming desire to exert control in response \nto them (Bleiker and Leet 2006).  \n \nIn human geography, Megoran (2005) and Oslender (2007) show how geopolitical \nstrategies in recent years spread terror and fear within local populations in Uzbekistan \nand Colombia respectively. For Bialasiewicz et al (2007), popular geopolitical \nrepresentations also feature in the reproduction of imaginative geographies of US \nsecurity strategies, echoing Sharp\u2019s (2000) earlier assertion that everyday practices \nand representations are crucial in forming notions of geopolitics and imagining enemy \nthreats through fear. Katz (2007) builds on this notion of a discursive construction of \nfear with the suggestion that fear in New York city following the 2001 attacks became \nmaterialized via urban architectures, police presence and security measures; \u2018banal \nterrorism\u2019 became installed as routine in our collective subconscious, and fear became \nnormal and accepted. Elsewhere, geographers have begun to engage with the ways in \nwhich bodies might be affected by and implicated in the politics of the war on\/of \nterror (e.g. Lim 2007; Thrift 2007b), a developing literature I return to later.  \n \nIII.      A critique \nTogether, this body of work on the new geopolitics of fear is important in its analysis \nof geopolitical relations and the identification of unjust international and domestic \npolicies. It is also important to point out its layering: it is multi-disciplinary, there is \ndiversity in its approaches to theory and empirical evidence, and so it does not present \na unified or harmonious canon of work. The critique below does not reflect doubt \nabout the value of these lines of enquiry. Nor is it made simply to point out what is \nlacking and might be added on. Instead, my aim is to highlight some of the \nunintended consequences of theories that take fear for granted, and the political \nimperative for at least considering the perspectives of those who are supposedly \n 8\nfearful, who do not currently constitute either collaborators or audience for much of \nthis work. I also question why these (geopolitical) geographies of fear often seem so \ndivorced from other (everyday) geographies of fear. I take issue with the frequently \nuncritical conceptualization and deployment of fear, the common assumptions about \nscale, and the lack of historicity that characterises some of this work. The second \nsense in which these explanations and emphases are \u2018global\u2019 is also problematic: fear \ntends to be prioritized and discussed as though it applies to everyone all of the time, \nwith little regard to social or spatial difference. There are assumptions that fear is, in \nthe first place, in all of these accounts of globalized fear; as well as assumptions about \nthe ways that emotions originate, travel and affect. Ironically, geographers have \nsometimes joined in the universalization of fear, applying it with a broad brush across \na flat earth. Within this literature, there are five important weaknesses.  \n \n1. Fear? Whose fear? \nThe vast majority of the work cited so far examines and makes proposals about \n(globalized) fear with little or no reference to the feelings, perceptions, views, \nsubjectivities or bodies of those who are supposed to be fearful. The concurrent lack \nof reference to empirical social research across much of this literature, which is well \ninto its fifth year now, is notable. Hopkins (2007b) makes a similar point about the \nabsence of the voices of marginalized groups in geographers\u2019 responses to the 2001 \nNew York attacks. I attend to both gaps in a follow up paper which reviews empirical \nevidence about globalized fear, which suggests that fear of terrorism is not \nwidespread among western populations: terrorist events lead to heightened fear which \ndrops off quickly as time passes, and fear effects are much sharper for certain \n(marginalised) groups (Pain 2008a). Yet research identifying the localised \u2018playing \nout\u2019 of globalized fear (a conceptualisation which is also problematized further \nbelow) is often ignored altogether, or placed as subordinate or tangential to the \narguments; critical or nuanced understandings of the local\/global relationships of \nemotion are not explored in much of the literature (for example, neither Bauman 2006 \nor Furedi 2006, 2007 dwell on empirical evidence about global fears). The sense is \nthat the arguments occupy loftier territory; the issues are of such urgent importance, \nthey rise or fall regardless of what might be going on on the ground. Very little \nattention is paid to whose fear it is that we are talking about: who names fear, who \nclaims it, and who actually feels it? How is it experienced, and what do people do \n 9\nwith it? How is it shaped and differentiated by varied lives, communities and places? \nWhile the influential work of geographers such as Graham (2004) and Sparke (2007) \nis more nuanced, engagement with available analyses of grounded geopolitical fear is \nalso lacking. Many political scientists tend to assume the effects of fear discourses in \ncreating fearful masses (see Pain and Smith 2008b).  \n \nA powerful critique by Crawford (2000) of the emotion-blank nature of theories of \ninternational politics, that predated the onset of the war on\/of terror and the escalation \nof the issues dealt with here (see also Ling 2000; and more recently Bleiker and \nHutchison 2008), might also be applied to recent scholarship in political geography. \nCrawford notes that \u2018theories of international politics and security depend on \nassumptions about emotions that are rarely articulated and which may not be correct\u2019 \n(Crawford 2000, 116), and \u2018ironically the emotions that security scholars do accept as \nrelevant \u2013 fear and hate \u2013 seem self-evidently important and are unproblematized. \nThis taken-for-granted status, especially of fear, has particularly pernicious effects\u2019 \n(118). I go on to identify some of these effects. \n \n2. Globe talk: a scaled hierarchy of fear \nThe notion of the movement of fear in the bulk of the literature cited so far is a firmly \nhierarchical one: fear moves from international political events and processes down \ninto people\u2019s minds, bodies and everyday lives. Global, the state, \u2018big\u2019 political forms \nand transnational processes are at the top, active and in control. Ordinary people\u2019s \nemotions are affected, sponge-like and passive, at the bottom. Furedi\u2019s work (2001, \n2006), again, is an archetypal example of this (see Pain 2006, 2008b). Even carefully \ncrafted and historically situated studies of fear such as Robin\u2019s (2004) and Bourke\u2019s \n(2005) do not pause to consider the consequences of people not being afraid (or of \nother emotions). The paradoxical lack of interest in feeling itself within analysis of the \nnew geopolitics of fear is likely only to reinforce a fixation with the global as the key \nscale for analysis. We have seen elsewhere how local\/global binaries do \nepistemological work to exclude the agency of women (Roberts 2004) and young \npeople (H\u00f6rschelmann and Sch\u00e4fer 2005). Marston et al (2005) critique the scalism \ninherent in the \u2018globe talk\u2019 of political and economic geography: in constructing the \nglobal as bigger, better, more important and more worthy of analysis, and through \ndemoting what happens at other scales, this globe talk \u2018plays into the hands of \n 10\nneoliberal commentators\u2019 (Marston et al 2005, 427). The construction of fear as \nglobalized and simultaneously passive produces disempowering identities for its \nsupposed subjects, and therefore may even reproduce the conceptualization of fear of \nthe political forces accused of seeking to order or manipulate emotions.  \n \nThere are exceptions within the new geopolitics of fear literature. For example, in \nMegoran\u2019s (2005) analysis of fear in Uzbekistan he deftly illustrates how a range of \ngovernment policies and actions are intended to garner popular support through \ncreating fear of neighbouring regimes, via popular culture as well as more direct \npolitical channels. He identifies how people\u2019s response to fear discourses is \nembodied, blurring the distinction between the political and the personal. Poynting et \nal (2004) craft a detailed tapestry of local fears, relating moral panics about the Arab \nOther in Australia to events at the national and global scale, but making clear that the \nexperience as well as the discursive construction of fear is always layered and multi-\nfaceted. Sparke (2007, 338) points to the pressing need to ground our understandings \nof hopes and fears in particular spatial contexts \u2018in all their physical, social, economic \ncultural and political complexity\u2019. He suggests that it is not enough to outline the \ngeographies of dispossession which are reinforced by the ways the war on\/of terror \nhas unfolded; \u2018we need to learn to learn from the dispossessed about their hope-filled \nstruggles to create geographies of repossession too\u2019 (Sparke 2007, 347; and see Pain \nand Smith 2008b). In their collection on political violence and fear, Gregory and Pred \n(2007, 6) set out an agenda including the examination of \u2018how political violence \ncompresses the sometimes forbiddingly abstract spaces of geopolitics and geo-\neconomics into the intimacies of everyday life and the innermost recesses of the \nhuman body\u2019. However, any notion that the intimate and the everyday simply absorb \nglobal political violences and fears would be problematic. The task goes well beyond \nsimply expanding the spaces and scales under consideration when charting the ways \nthat politics has its effects. Indeed, and as the later discussion of feminist political \ngeography will explore, there is a strong case for rupturing the very idea of these \nspaces and scales, because they tend to fix commanding notions about emotions, \npower, human agency and being (Pain and Smith 2008b; Pratt and Rosner 2006).  \n \n3. Fear as a social and political construction \n 11\nMost commentators, whether writing about global fears or the more mundane aspects \nof the \u2018culture of fear\u2019, discuss fear as a discourse rather than a material emotion or \naffect. Furedi (2001, 2006) is an exemplar, reading an increasingly \u2018fearful\u2019 society \noff its media prominence, opinion polls and its reproduction through scientific and \ngovernment statements. His work epitomizes the cultural construction of fear; Furedi \n(2001) pares down fear for children\u2019s safety to the point where there is no actual risk, \nno harm, no social unevenness and no geography to children\u2019s experiences of danger \nand fear, reproducing a certain classed and adultist interpretation of childhood (see \nPain 2006). So assumptions about the effect of terrorism on our fears are certainly not \nalone in ignoring the ground. Again, in failing to question the uptake of globalized \nfear or identify the range of responses and resistances to it, many critical scholars are, \ninadvertently, in danger of reifying and reproducing the very fear discourses that they \ntake issue with (for example Bauman 2006; Isin 2004). Rather than dismiss the \ndiscursive power of fear, we should understand it primarily as an emotion which \nrelates in various ways to risk in different contexts, at the same time as it may be \ndeployed and experienced as a signifier, discourse or political tool. Such an \nunderstanding means moving between scales, and keeping a critical eye on their \nconstruction.  \n \n4. Exposing privilege: whose fears matter? \nFourthly, there is the unspoken privilege of the fears that these accounts mostly \ndescribe. We know from other contexts that fear is always named, known, privileged \nand spatialized in certain ways by the powerful, and that it tends to affect the poorest \nand most marginalized people the most (see the later discussion of fear of crime). Yet \nthe preoccupation in the globalized fear literatures is the fears of people in the west, \nwhen the harm and devastation wrought by the war on\/of terror is far greater outside \nthe west. Critical geographers have done more to make this paradox visible than other \nscholars (see Abu Zhara 2008; Graham 2004; Hewitt 2001; Megoran 2005; Oslender \n2007; Wright 2008). Within the west, too, we would be wise to attend to Beck\u2019s \n(2002) reminder that risks may be global and unbounded, but also sharply \ndifferentiated in terms of their unequal social and geographical impacts. The poor are \nroutinely written out of fear. Yet it is the quietest fears, with little political capital but \nmore immediate materiality, which have the sharpest impacts (Shirlow and Pain \n2003). \n 12\n \nGlobal discourses of \u2018global\u2019 fear are also centrally about whiteness. They themselves \nare ordered by power geometries (see Tolia-Kelly 2007, 2008; after Massey 1993). As \nLing (2000, 242) pointed out in an earlier critique, the set of narratives underlying \ndiscussions of globalization \u2018recalls earlier relations between a colonial self and its \nnative Other\u2019. As they are presently construed, the subjects of rapidly moving global \nfear are white people living in the west, faced with fears about others harming them \nand their way of life from near or afar. Thus a pressing but unspoken dimension of the \n\u2018culture of fear\u2019 (Furedi 2006; Glassner 1999) is its whiteness. In contrast, Poynting et \nal (2004) ask what preconditions have allowed the emergence of a \u2018culture of fear\u2019 in \nwestern societies and its deployment to further certain political agendas: their answer \nis its close relation with and contingency upon anxiety about racial and ethnic \ndimensions in particular western nations. Theories of globalized fear, then, should \nalso be contested on these grounds; they often do little to challenge the assumption \nthat fear is the prerogative of the privileged. Research with minority ethnic groups in \nthe west suggests otherwise (e.g. Hopkins 2007b). Class is another unspoken divider \nwhich affects the impact and distribution of global fears. And while a gendered \ncritique of the war on\/of terror is gaining ground (Hunt and Rygeil 2006), especially \nfocusing on its consequences for Muslim women, it is anomalous that very little work \nas yet identifies how the global fears under discussion here might in fact be highly \ngendered (see Ling 2000).  \n \n5. Making room for agency, resistance and action \nFinally, there is little room for agency in accounts of globalized fear. Isn\u2019t fear reacted \nto, thought about, reformulated, resisted and reshaped into other emotions and \nactions? Don\u2019t feelings have transformative power of their own? Few of those writing \nabout global fear have considered that emotions stimulate action and affect the \npractices, progress and shape of politics at different scales (see, in contrast, Askins \n2008; Bleiker and Hutchison 2008; Crawford 2000; Goodwin et al 2001; \nH\u00f6rschelmann 2008; Wright 2008). While hope may be mentioned as a smaller but \npromising cousin of fear, it is largely done with all of the limitations that I have \ndescribed as applying to analyses of fear (with important exceptions including Wright \n2008).  \n \n 13\nThe top down dialectic of discourse\/experience, refracted through global\/local and \ngeopolitical\/everyday, is too simple and has been contested for many years in the \nliteratures I go on to explore. Alongside critiques of the war on\/of terror and its \noppressive policies, then, we might want to ask how people engage with global fear \ndiscourses, how everyday experiences of fear feed into these discourses, and how fear \nrelates, interacts and circulates across these imagined scales of the abstract.  \n \nIV. Framing an emotional geopolitics of fear \nI have argued so far that understandings of the new geopolitics of fear primarily view \nfear as discursively produced and circulated for political ends. There is a tendency \namong some left scholars to use and reinforce this construction of fear, alongside their \ncritique of its deployment by governments. I now go on to suggest an alternative \u2013 an \nemotional geopolitics of fear - and in so doing, further destabilise some of the \ndominant discourses and taken for granted assumptions within geopolitical analysis \nand its scaling of the politics of fear. \n \nLikewise, feminist critiques of political geography in general, and globalization in \nparticular, have taken issue not just with geographers\u2019 mainstream accounts, but also \nwith critical geographers\u2019 critiques of them. In an elegant and powerful piece, Nagar \net al (2002, 260) suggest that geographers\u2019 accounts of globalization provide a \u2018rich \nand important literature [but] tend to deal with (1) economic processes in the formal \nsector, (2) only certain places and scales, and (3) only certain actors\u2019 (see also \nH\u00f6rschelmann and Sch\u00e4fer 2005). Nagar et al go on to suggest remedies to these \nexclusions using existing feminist literature. In parallel, I suggest, many accounts of \nthe new geopolitics of fear, including those of critical geographers, are guilty of \nsimilar exclusions. Feminist and critical work elsewhere in the discipline underpins \nthe critique of globalized fear drawn above, and already provides some suggestions as \nto how these exclusions might be addressed.  \n \nI make three suggestions in calling for an emotional geopolitics of fear. The first is \nthat we rework our understanding of geopolitics to take greater account of emotions, \nand that we should seek to understand and incorporate emotions in nuanced and \ngrounded ways (Crawford 2000). The geopolitics of fear are embedded in cultural, \neconomic, social and spatial micro-geopolitics, as evidenced by other studies of wider \n 14\nexclusion. The bodies of work discussed below provide a starting point for this \nreconceptualization. Secondly, a more emotional geopolitics means taking up \nepistemological challenges that feminist researchers have laid down for decades, and  \nthirdly, the refocusing of attention on resistance, agency and action. In Section V, I \nexpand on this conceptual, empirical and political agenda. First, in supporting this \ncall, I draw upon three existing bodies of literature that comprise a frame for \nanalysing the global\/geopolitical and the local\/everyday. These are critical research on \nfear of crime, feminist accounts of globalization and critical geopolitics, and recent \nwork on emotional\/affective geographies. Their connections to globalized fear are \nreviewed below. Little of this work has explored global fears, and little of it, in turn, \nhas been drawn on or acknowledged by the bulk of the literature I have discussed so \nfar.  \n \n1. Critical work on the fear of crime  \nThe critical literature exploring the effects of fear of crime in everyday life developed \nin the 1980s and 1990s. Much is located in feminist social science including human \ngeography, but it also includes ethnographic studies in sociology and criminology. It \nis characterised by the use of qualitative methodologies as well as carefully crafted \nlocal surveys, and tends to focus on the sharp divisions of well-being and marginality \nthat fear reinforces, particularly around poverty, race, gender and place. As Megoran \n(2005) has observed, its insights have been overlooked in the new geopolitics of fear. \nSociologists and social geographers are just beginning to reflect on overlaps and \nconsequences of crime fear and terror fear (e.g. Altheide 2003; Koskela 2009; Mythen \nand Walklate 2006; Pain and Smith 2008a), and political scientists might follow suit. \n \nHere, fear is viewed as an emotion with embodied sensations and material \nimplications. Fear inhabits people, and they, rather than ethereal, mobile or free-\nfloating discourses, are the subject of empirical and analytical attention. Fear is also \nseen as situated and contextual, affected by local places and events as well as wider \nspatial settings (Loader et al 1998; Smith 1987, 1989). As Simonsen (2007, 175) \nwrites more recently, \u2018moods\u2026are attunements \u2013 contextual significances of the \nworld, associated with practices, lifemode and social situation\u2019. Critical work on the \nfear of crime has explored the role of personal biographies, dispositions and previous \nexperiences in explaining present day fears within communities, but also their \n 15\nintersections with wider social, economic and political structures including class, \ngender, age, ability and ethnicity (Crawford et al 2000; Pain 2000; Stanko 1990; \nWalklate 1989). Although local lives and topographies are the main focus, feminist \nwork in particular \u2018jumps scales\u2019 (see Cahill 2004, 2007), binding everyday \nexperiences to wider networks of power and privilege.  \n \nFear is not viewed as a static or negative state in these accounts, but as continuously \nchallenged, resisted and reshaped. Importantly, people do not absorb messages about \nhow to feel uncritically or without reference to context, knowledge or experience. \nPeople also worry, feel angry, are bold, and hope, and all of these emotions are \nviewed as having the potential to be transformative (Koskela 1997). Finally, fear is \nnot a quantity or quality we can fully know, and cannot be assumed. One of the key \npoints has been that those who are often the most fearful, for example certain groups \nof young people, are more likely to be victims of crime than offenders, and to be \nfearful as well as feared (Brown 2005; Muncie 2004). There are strong parallels here \nwith demonized groups in the current geopolitical climate, as the research of scholars \nsuch as Dunn et al (2007), Hopkins (2007b), Noble (2005) and Pederson et al (2006) \nbears out. These studies share the emphasis in the critical fear of crime literature on \nsensitive, contextualized research to challenge assumptions and stereotypes about \nfear, the fearful and the feared: exactly what is missing in most recent accounts of \ngeopolitical fear. For Mythen and Walklate (2006), questions that arise from fear of \ncrime for the war on\/of terror include whom we are seeking safety and protection \nfrom, how this varies following lines of gender, race, age, place, class and so on, and \nwhat shape \u2018cultures of fear\u2019 take on the ground. Elsewhere, drawing parallels with \nresearch on parents\u2019 fears for children, I raise the political dangers of oversimplifying \nthe likely consequences of the war on\/of terror for fear, calling for critical distance \nfrom assumptions of widespread fearfulness (Pain 2008b).  \n \n2. Feminist accounts of globalization and geopolitics \nScale is at the heart of problems with existing accounts of global fear. Feminist \nscholarship on globalization and geopolitics, though it has had little to say about \nemotion to date, offers some exciting possibilities for rethinking scale. It is not \nenough to consider how global processes play out at local scales, the angle taken in \n\u2018globe talk\u2019 where it diverges from asserting only the global (Marston et al 2005). \n 16\nNeither is it satisfactory to classify emotions as either locally- or globally-produced \n(for example personal\/community experiences of fear, versus state \nsuggestion\/imposition). We might think instead about emotions being experienced as \nsimultaneously both local and global. For example, Hopkins\u2019 (2007a) work weaves \nboth sites into his discussion of the fears of young Muslim men in Scotland; while \nH\u00f6rschelmann and Sch\u00e4fer (2005) describe young people as living and performing the \nglobal through the local, engaging with and negotiating globalization in different \nways. Further, recent feminist critiques of globalization point to the need to unlearn \nand relearn scale (Roberts 2004). As Pratt and Rosner (2006) insist with their \ncollection of feminist work on the intertwining of global and intimate relations, the \ndisruption of grand narratives of global relations and the upending of hierarchies of \nspace and scale are vital. Disturbing the scales of local and global altogether is \nnecessary if everyday practices and actions are not simply taken to \u2018confirm the force \nand inevitability of certain modes of global capitalist expansion\u2019 (Pratt and Rosner \n2006, 16). In other words, we might disturb and dispense with scales and binaries \nsuch as local\/global altogether, as these have disturbing political implications yet \nremain surprisingly resistant in the face of such critiques (Marston et al 2005). This \nimperative suggests de-scaling accounts of globalized fear which, as I outlined in the \nfirst half of the paper, prioritise and reify the global, the geopolitical, and the actions \nof large political structures. De-scaling globalized fear might allow the shape, \nmovement and transformative power of emotions to emerge and their effects to be \nbetter appreciated. \n \nSome key ideas in feminist critical geopolitics also inform the examination of \nglobalized fear. Critical geopolitics as a subdiscipline incorporates work on the \neveryday and private realms, though it more often focuses on the mundane everyday \nthan everyday politics (Dowler and Sharp 2001). Here too, hierarchies of global\/local \nare dismantled to reimagine a more rounded and democratized understanding of \ngeopolitics. Dowler and Sharp (2001) propose three interventions for a feminist \ngeopolitics that are relevant to the current discussion. First, they identify the need to \nembody geopolitics, focusing on how particular bodies are used and represented, in \nevaluating discourses and in highlighting everyday experience (see also Hyndman \n2003). In parallel with this critique of geopolitics, much analysis of fear has been \ndominated by rationalist, disembodied notions of fear - for example dismissing fear \n 17\nthat seems \u2018too much\u2019 or overblown (Furedi 2001) denies the emotional and \nembodied aspects of the relationships between adults and children.  \n \nSecondly, Dowler and Sharp suggest we need to locate geopolitical analysis more \nclearly, to counter previous western discourses. The charge that \u2018critics stand at an \nironic distance\u2026without having to disclose their own location\u2026yet it is a western \nform of reasoning, dominated by white, male academics\u2019 (Dowler and Sharp 2001, \n167) also applies to recent literatures on the geopolitics of fear (though, to be fair, \ncritics of the war on\/of terror find little reason for irony). Globalized fear is largely \nabout us fearing them, and is negatively correlated with risk and harm; but its \nstrategies for gaining analytical purchase on fear rarely include deferring to the fearful \nor feared. More positive - and carrying the political possibility of challenging the \nnature as well as manipulation of fear \u2013 is a rebuilding of understanding from the \nperspectives of those most affected. \n \nThirdly, Dowler and Sharp suggest we need to ground geopolitics and consider how \ninternational representations and processes work out in everyday life. Various \nexamples of feminist work make these connections and insist on a \u2018microscale\u2019 \ngeopolitics of the everyday, including May\u2019s (1988) classic study of the cold war and \nUS identity, Secor (2001) on Islamist politics in Istanbul, and Kallus (2004) on how \nthe residential environment in Israel becomes a site of geopolitical struggle over \nnational territory. A rich example is Katz\u2019s (2004) \u2018countertopography\u2019 of US and \nSudanese childhoods in the context of global restructuring, in which she draws out the \nways that processes affecting what appear to be very different places are intertwined. \nHer argument is that places and scales speak to and affect each other in both \ndirections. Such arguments apply as well to fear, as there are contiguous rather than \nlinear relationships between global processes and local topographies of emotion.  \n \nRecent work that specifically focuses on the war on\/of terror puts these tenets into \ntheory and practice. Hunt and Rygiel (2006) challenge the overwhelmingly gendered \nliterature and representations of war on\/of terror, arguing that certain types of people \nare presented as active agents involved in the doing and shaping of these particular \nglobal events, and others are \u2018acted upon\u2019, passive recipients of the war on\/of terror. \nThey call for attention to intersectionality, rather than the reproduction of \n 18\nhomogenous subjects such as \u2018woman\u2019. Feminist analyses \u2018disrupt and make visible \nthe masculinized, militarized, racialized, sexualized, and classed dynamics through \nwhich the war operates\u2019 (Hunt and Rygiel 2006, 3), as well as providing political \ngrounds from which to contest the oppression that men and women around the world \nmay experience because of the war on\/of terror. In particular, they want to shift \nattention away from the dominant focus of western discussions on Islamic terrorists \nand their victims. Hannah (2005) also exposes the effect of powerful American \ndiscourses - masculinity and the frontier myth - on shaping US foreign policy since \n2001. Cowen and Gilbert (2008) highlight the centrality of heteronormative \ndiscourses about home and family to government strategies that produce and \nreproduce fear in the war on\/of terror, while Puar (2007), in a study of social identities \nin the face of growing securitization, identifies \u2018homonationalism\u2019 in the sexualization \nand racialization of threatening potential terrorist bodies. So we might add to Dowler \nand Sharp\u2019s (2001) agenda for a more embodied, located and grounded geopolitics, a \nmore emotional one.  \n \n3. Emotional and affective geographies   \nThe third body of literature that can help to frame an emotional geopolitics is recent \nwork on emotional\/affective geographies. The burgeoning area of emotional \ngeographies has remained curiously separate from discussions in political geography. \nMore widely throughout the social sciences, it is argued that emotions need to have a \nfar more prominent position in analysis of the socio-spatial world (Anderson and \nSmith 2001; Davidson et al 2005; Turner and Stets 2005). The suggestion is not to \nfocus in on emotions, risking their depoliticization or trivialization, but to demonstrate \nthat they, and their spatialities, are fundamental to the layout of society. Here, I \naddress two overlapping pathways that geographical analysis has taken.  \n \nFirst, a body of work broadly titled emotional geographies has, over the last few \nyears, investigated the importance of emotions to social processes and landscapes, to \nsubjective experiences of space and place, and to the policy arenas which affect them \n(Anderson and Smith 2001; Davidson and Milligan 2004; Pain and Smith 2008; Parr \net al 2005). The relations between individuals are informed by emotions, which are \nthemselves always part of constellations of wider individual and collective landscapes \n(Conradson and McKay 2007). In particular, social geographers have emphasised that \n 19\nthe subjectivity of emotions is inherently tied to social inequalities (see Panelli et al \n2004; Thien 2005b) and to power geometries (Tolia-Kelly 2007, 2008), and that \npeople\u2019s conscious evaluation of emotions may lead to collective action (Pain et al \n2008). Such work is closely influenced by feminist theory and practice, and often \nbeing explicit about the positionalities, emotions and relations of writers and \nsubject\/participants. These premises begin to address critiques of the use of globalized \nfear. For (geo)political geographies, we might see emotions not just as blank \ncanvasses, waiting to be affected by wider events and relations, but as situated, \nhistoricized and relational \u2013 already formed and always changing - and affecting \npolitics, as much as they are affected by politics, at a range of scales. So fear, as \nfeminist analyses have long reminded us, is an emotional response tied to existing \nlives, their topographies, histories and daily insecurities. It was not dropped onto \nwestern countries following the handful of terrorist attacks since 2001. It was already \nthere, embedded in and focused on complex places and identities; it was present \nsimultaneously in entwined local and international histories of risk and threat (Pain \nand Smith 2008b). Approached in this way, emotionality can help us get away from \nindividualized understandings of global fear, as well as accounts which focus \nprimarily on the discursive. One of the values of emotional geographies is its implicit \nfocus on agency, and the challenge it might pose to hierarchical notions of politics \n(following Crawford 2000; Ling 2000).  \n \nSecondly, affective geographies have offered the promise of \u2018a different kind of \nintelligence about the world\u2019 that centres on the biological constitution of being as a \nperformative force, non-verbal communication and the openness of events (Thrift \n2004, 60). This work, closely connected to non-representational geographies, centres \non stimuli and interactions that accompany pre-cognitive affects upon bodies, and \nhave the power to move events, people and places (e.g. Conradson and Latham 2007; \nTolia-Kelly 2007, 2008; Woodward and Lea 2009). This emphasis on movement \noffers an engagement with fear which is potentially highly relevant to the discussion \nhere, given that a key question in unpicking the hierarchical scaling of the geopolitical \nand everyday (see Section III) is how else emotions might move (see Pain and Smith \n2008b). These relations of affect may be channelled for political purposes (Woodward \nand Lea 2009); for example, Thrift (2007a) has outlined how the state may use \naffective contagion to control emotions and establish political and moral authorities, \n 20\nusing bodies as unconscious or semi-conscious receivers and transmitters of \nknowledge and feeling. Scholars working with affect have begun to apply these \ninsights to issues around the war on\/of terror. As Ahmed (2004) describes, love, hate \nand fear towards certain bodies are invoked by the war on\/of terror, concretizing a \nfeeling of the collective and its others. Lim\u2019s (2007) analysis of fear and terror \nexplores \u2018the ways that fear becomes captured by or inserted into narratives of \nterror\u2026[and]\u2026put into service to recruit people and bodies to political causes, \ninterests and actions\u2019.  \n \nHowever, wider critiques of geographies of affect also have relevance to this \nparticular application. While they may seem scales apart in the focus of their analysis, \nsome writing on affective geographies reflects, rather than challenges, the hierarchical \nrelationships that are so problematic within the literature on the new geopolitics of \nfear. Affective contagion can also seem to move between bodies across a flat earth; \nthe weight of the record of fear as a sharply uneven and socially differentiating \nphenomenon, and its role in social injustice, are not always made evident or \nprominent (Tolia-Kelly 2006, 2007). Affect may also seem to relegate emotion to \nimmediacy, immanence and the virtual, whereas \u2018affective registers have to be \nunderstood within the context of power geometries that shape our social world\u2019 \n(Tolia-Kelly 2006, 213). The focus on immediate corporeal sensations also carries the \ndanger of negating the role of past experience (Ahmed 2004; Tolia-Kelly 2006). The \nways in which cognitive thought, consciousness and planned action continually \nchange and move fear are, understandably, not the focus of attention. In emphasising \nthe pre-cognitive, and sometimes in lacking empirical example, affect moves beyond \nthe limits of social constructivism but can feel as detached, disembodied and \nimpersonal as the geopolitics literature reviewed earlier (see Bondi\u2019s (2005) parallel \nargument about non-representational theory). For Thien (2005a), too, affect flits over \nthe crucial sphere of everyday life and emotional subjectivities, paradoxically serving \nto further distance emotion from scholarship and the public arena: it begs questions \nabout authority and who is speaking for whom (Bondi 2005; Thien 2005a; Tolia-\nKelly 2006).  \n \nIn recent responses to these criticisms, geographers have argued that affect can \ncontribute far more to social geographies that attempt to be moral and engaged than \n 21\nhas been evident to date (see Woodward and Lea 2009). Lim (2007) suggests that \nthinking of fear as an affect allows for a focus on what bodies do in the moment of \nencounter, but need not preclude the ways in which bodily memory plays out. Further, \nthe role of affect in how social movements come about it outlined by Woodward and \nLea (2009). Meanwhile, Thrift (2007b) writes of the possibilities of deploying affect \nas a practical strategy, as well as in understanding its misuse by the media in the war \non\/of terror. His suggestion for working on hope and stimulating compassion as a \npracticable affective measure in answer to suicide bombings is one many critical \ngeographers might identify with. However, it is an agenda which is (perhaps \ndeliberately) vague, with neither the mechanics nor the personnel specified. His \naccount of the \u2018necessity of working on the affective episteme of Western populations \nso that they make connections with the world they currently may lack\u2026Western \npopulations exhibit pity when what is really needed is compassion\u2019 (Thrift 2007b, \n286, original emphasis) is a more sympathetic account of Western emotions than the \nlabel \u2018fearful\u2019. However, it makes assumptions about its subjects - we know very little \nabout what \u2018western populations\u2019 are actually feeling in relation to the war on\/of \nterror (but see Hopkins 2007a and Horschelmann 2008 who identify different and \ncomplex emotional responses) and, as I have argued, speculation is not without \ndanger. It also fails to address questions about the audience for geographers\u2019 critiques \nof the war on\/of terror and their ultimate impact. We are left to wonder how do those \nfeeling fear and other emotions already analyse and act upon these feelings? \n \nThe tendency to distinguish between emotion and affect is challenged by Simonsen \n(2007). In a refreshing account of a geography of practice, she emphasises the \ncontextual, relational and multi-scalar nature of emotions; \u2018emotions are neither \n\u201cactions\u201d nor \u201cpassions\u201d (understood as forces beyond our control that simply happen \nto us) \u2013 they are both at once\u2019 (177). She seeks to link social practices from bodily to \ntransnational scales, by understanding how they \u2018meet up with moving and fixed \nmaterialities and form configurations that are continuously under transformation and \nnegotiation\u2019 in particular places (179). Her account builds on both emotional and \naffective geographies, providing a more promising conceptualisation that might \ncounter \u2018globalized fear\u2019. In the next section, I outline another. \n \nV. Towards an agenda for an emotional geopolitics of fear \n 22\nThe particular conceptual, epistemological and political agenda for an emotional \ngeopolitics of fear that I forward here uses the concept of conscientization \n(conscientiza\u00e7\u00e3o), which was first used by the Brazilian radical educator Paulo Freire \n(1972) to describe the development of critical consciousness from within. He \noriginally applied it to students for whom education was crucial in challenging their \nmarginalised status, with the goal of revolutionary liberation. The term has since been \ntaken up more widely, and beyond critical pedagogy, for example into participatory \naction research in geography (see Kindon et al 2007). Importantly in the context of \nthe arguments here, conscientization may describe a theory, a method or a process of \nsocial change (as, in radical pedagogy, these are not separated). \n \nMy call for an emotional geopolitics of fear combines all three of these strands. The \nfirst concerns the nature of analysis; the need to reconceptualize the relationship \nbetween emotions and global issues in a way that challenges the hierarchical, \nprocedural scaling of emotions that characterises much work on the war on\/of terror. \nAs the earlier critique of the position of human agency in the new geopolitics of fear \nliterature suggested, there is an urgent need to interrogate how power and resistance \namong individuals and communities, alongside power and domination by the state, \nmight apply to the effects of emotions. As well as thinking about how people and \nsocial relations are pushed and pulled by emotions (as the new geopolitics of fear and \naffect literatures describe, in different ways), how do they knowingly deploy them, \npublicly, privately, individually and collectively? An emotional geopolitics of fear \nthat explores and engages the conscientization of fear (after Freire 1972) might ask \nhow do self-conscious and self-critical experiences of fear inform ground-up \nprocesses of change; how do emotional conditions, within and without, politicise \nsubjects and mobilise self- and collective action at conscious level? Navigating a path \nbetween the current possibilities and limitations of both emotional and affective \ngeographies (after Simonsen 2007), conscientization has important implications for \nepistemology and action (see below), but this deployment of it need not exclude the \naffective. I recognise that constructing a too-rational fearful subject precludes \npotentially significant understandings of the ways that emotions also figure pre-\ncognitively (Lim 2007; Woodward and Lea 2009), as well as the ways in which \nmarginalised people are sometimes positioned within power geometries so as to \npreclude conscious action (after Tolia-Kelly 2007).  \n 23\n \nSecondly, conscientization underpins the epistemological standpoints that an \nemotional geopolitics of fear might draw on and deploy. Throughout the paper, I have \ncommented on the lack of reference to the (supposedly) fearful which is notable in \nwider literatures on the geopolitics of fear, and geographers\u2019 writings on the war on\/of \nterror and affect. I have also pointed to feminist theory and practice in several existing \nareas which highlights the imperative for thinking, feeling and questioning our own \npositionalities in writing and research (e.g. Haraway 1991; Moss 2002). While critical \ngeographers rapidly condemned of the war on\/of terror, and have called for more \nhumanitarian and cosmopolitan responses, analysis in this field is still dominated by \nwestern, white, male academics, often still engaging in remote and disembodied ways \nrather than exposing our own involvement in the relations we write about. Can we \nfocus, as well, upon people\u2019s own conscious navigation of fear, with a political \nstrategy defined dialogically with those who feel fear? Can we engage an \nepistemological shift to emotion with, rather than emotion of or compassion for? I am \nnot suggesting that there is no place for analyses that are purely conceptual or \nspeculative, nor am I keen to see the sort of  emotional and personalized accounts that \nultimately inflate the self. But the issues of injustice at the present time also demand a \nplace for engaged research which attends more carefully to emotions, and rethinks \nand recasts our own relationships with others. \n \nSome geographers are already responding by giving voice to marginalized groups \nwho are central to the patterning, nature and implications of global fears (e.g. Dunn et \nal 2007, Hopkins 2007b, Pederson et al 2006). Further, research conducted with the \ngoal of positive social change on people\u2019s own terms by activist and participatory \ngeographers, especially those identifying as feminist scholars, has explicitly deployed \nemotionality \u2013 what Kindon (2009) calls \u2018affect with effect\u2019 - for some time (on fear, \nsee Cahill 2004, 2006; Pain et al 2008; Wright 2008). Conscientization provides a \nmethodological strategy that underpins such efforts. As a process of learning that \nleads to change, it involves those traditionally considered teachers\/students or \nresearchers\/researched working alongside each other in more even knowledge \nexchanges and theory building. Conscientization differs from consciousness-raising, \nas knowledge is not transferred from one (expert) group to another (disempowered) \ngroup, but is co-produced. This form of engaged and explicitly relational scholarship \n 24\nhas much to contribute to critical geopolitics. And unlike the affective geographies \nliterature at present, where emotions are written as taking on a life of their own but \nstill usually given life by the scholar\u2019s monologue, conscientization suggests working \nfrom the ways in which people already speak for themselves. \n \nThirdly, and closely related, conscientization describes what people do with fear at \nmany scales: mobilising emotions for action and social change. In the bulk of the \nliterature on globalized fear, as I have argued, there is little mention of resistance to \nfear, of other emotions, or the work that they do in contesting and changing unjust \nsituations and consequences. Yet fear can be a positive and galvanizing force as well \nas a harmful and divisive one: it changes people and places and their trajectories in \ndifferent ways, and it is not just the already-powerful who harness these effects. \nLooking outside the academy, we can see that fear and hope are already being used to \ncounter the metanarrative of globalized fear and the increasingly oppressive and \nunjust policies which the war on\/of terror has led to in the west. These actions may be \nconscientized and conscious, planned, or of the moment. How we analyse and \nincorporate emotion into geopolitics partly depends on how we understand the scaling \nand relations involved in geopolitics. Here, I am building on Koopman\u2019s (2008) \nnotion of \u2018alter-geopolitics\u2019, which describes new proposals and practices that seek to \nchallenge hegemonic geopolitics and create new geopolitics. Koopman\u2019s emphasis is \non grassroots movements that build international relations of solidarity. Activist \nstruggles and new coalitions that are emerging in response to terror, hate crimes and \ncommunity fears materialise varied geographies of hope (Ahmad 2002; Oslender \n2007; Weber 2006; Wright 2008 ). We can add to this people\u2019s strategies for resisting \nor contesting globalized fear in everyday life (Pain et al 2008), and practices that \nbridge racial and religious difference that have been described as everyday \ncosmopolitanism (Noble 2009).   \n \nVI. Conclusion \nIn this paper, I have argued for the development of an emotional geopolitics of fear as \none tool to understand, reposition and respond to accounts of \u2018globalized fear\u2019. \nIdentifying major limitations in the dominant discourse of globalized fear, I have \nexamined how it is nonetheless manifested in recent work by geographers and others \nwriting about the new geopolitics of fear. We know relatively little about these new \n 25\npatterns of fear, or how they relate to older patterns. Notwithstanding that, important \ninsights can be gained from three bodies of existing literature elsewhere: critical work \non fear of crime; feminist accounts of globalization and geopolitics; and geographies \nof emotion and affect. These three fields provide a frame for gaining a fuller sense of \nthe places, politics and possibilities of fear, with particular lessons for dismantling \nscale and analysing how emotions move; rethinking the relation of global\/geopolitical \nand the local\/everyday\/intimate; charting the continuing significance of place to \nindividual and collective emotional topographies; and the centrality of emotions to \nresistance, agency and action. I have used the concept of conscientization to underpin \none agenda for an emotional geopolitics of fear, which involves engaged and \nemotional scholarship. As Askins (2008: 246) suggests, there are many ways in which \nour own work might shift towards seeking and enabling a \u2018transformative geopolitics\u2019 \nof fear.  \n \nFinally, it is worth reflecting on the gulfs between some of the bodies of literature \nreviewed here. They are complementary, and should be closely aligned, and yet the \nscale and persistence of the marginalisation of feminist work is staggering. This \nfollows through political geography in general (as Sharp 2007 and Staeheli et al 2004 \nhave highlighted), globalization and geopolitics (Mountz and Hyndman 2006; Nagar \net al 2002), mainstream work on fear of crime (Pain 2000) and affective geographies \n(Bondi 2005); the list could go on beyond the remit of this paper; the exclusions \nreflect wider patterns of gendered knowledge construction. Academic scholarship is a \nmicrocosm of the processes and worlds we study; some themes and modes of analysis \nbecome \u2018global\u20196 very quickly, while others stay persistently localized. Many feminist \nscholars continue their efforts to dismantle the unjust scaling of resources in everyday \nlife. Now the challenge of undoing and refocusing the scaling of academic endeavour \nmight be taken up by others. \n \nAcknowledgements \nI am grateful to three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, and for a \nPhilip Leverhulme Prize that supported this work.

As Cowan and \nGilbert (2008) argue, fear is central to its operation: as well as being a war on \nterrorism it has been, ostensibly, a war to protect from fear, in reality one which must \ninvoke fear to succeed. They also discuss the ways in which the US regime governs \nthrough terror. \n \n3 See also Koskela (2009) who uses this term in a slightly different way.  \n \n4 From transcript of a video message from al-Qaeda claiming responsibility for the \nMarch 2004 bombings in Madrid. \nhttp:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/europe\/3509556.stm accessed 4th June 2008. \n \n5 From an internet statement of the Secret Organization of al-Qaeda in Europe, who \nclaimed responsibility for the July 2005 bombings in London. \nhttp:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk\/4660391.stm accessed 4th June 2008. \n \n6 \u2018Global\u2019 in this context, as for globalized fear, also means \u2018western\u2019: for example, \nthe standard for \u2018global\u2019 excellence within Anglo-American geography is to be well \nknown, circulated and cited within Anglo-American geography.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nAbu Zhara, N. 2008: Identity cards and coercion in Palestine.
