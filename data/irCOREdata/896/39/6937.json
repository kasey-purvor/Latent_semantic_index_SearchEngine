Vosniadou, E. De Corte and H.\nMandl, volume 137 in NATO ASI Series F\n(Computer and Systems Sciences), Berlin,\nSpringer-Verlag, ISBN: 0-387-58253-3, 1994.\nThis publication is one of a collection of texts\nthat has been produced within the NATO ASI F\nseries - books published as a result of the\nactivities of the special programme on advanced\neducational technology. Currently, the list of\nbooks in this series totals over 35. The present\nvolume contains 37 papers that were contributed\nto the Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on\nEducational Technology held in Crete in the\nsummer of 1992. The purpose of the Institute\nwas to bring together lecturers and graduate\nstudents in order to investigate and discuss the\npsychological and educational foundations of\ntechnology-based learning environments, and to\ndebate the implications of recent research\nfindings in the area of cognitive science for the\ndevelopment of educational technology.\nThe papers that make up these proceedings are\norganized into four basic sections, each devoted\nto a particular theme.\nPart 1 contains 10 contributions dealing with\ndesign principles for learning environments. A\nrange of relevant issues is discussed, some of the\nmore important of which are: theoretically-based\nvisions of educational environments; active and\nconstructive learning; exploratory learning\nenvironments; simulations; socio-cultural issues;\nthe use of intelligent co-operative systems; role\nplay; experimentation; and assessing the effects\nof a learning environment.\nThe ten papers that make up the second part of\nthe book deal with the use of educational\ntechnology to promote conceptual change in the\nphysical sciences. Some of the interesting topics\ndiscussed in this section include multimedia\nenvironments for enhancing science instruction;\ngenerative problem-solving in school science;\nuse of hypermedia; model-based reasoning;\npromoting the study of conceptual change;\ndiagnosis and remediation; software tools\nintegration, environmental education; and the\ndevelopment of subject-oriented learning\nenvironments for teaching basic electricity, the\nhuman nervous system and physics.\nThe third part contains eight papers. These\nexplore, describe and discuss various aspects of\ntechnology-based learning environments\ndevoted to knowledge acquisition in\nmathematics and natural language. The first\nfive papers deal with topics related to the study\nof mathematics, namely the use of multimedia\nenvironments for enhancing student learning in\nmathematics; task analysis and didactic tools to\nsupport mathematics tutoring; 'unintelligent'\ntutoring in algebra based on psychological\ntheories and experimentation; the use of\nintermediate models for solving word problems\ninvolving the development of arithmetic skills;\nand the use of computer programming as a\nmechanism to support the development of\nopen-ended project work. The remaining three\npapers deal with specific issues in language\nlearning, covering the use of computer-based\nmethods to develop reading and writing skills;\ncomputer facilitation of skilled narrative writing\nprocesses; and the development of a 'flow-\ndriven' English (as a foreign language) course.\n76\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nThe final part of the book - containing the\nremaining nine papers - is devoted to the theme:\n'Taking into consideration the needs of the\nlearner'. The important issues covered here\ninclude the use of knowledge profiles in a\nflexible learning environment; the use of student\nmodels; semantic networks; representational\nsystems in mathematics and science; the use of\ngraphics in the computer-aided learning of\nchemistry; an investigation into motivation and\nco-operation in computer-assisted learning; and\nvarious issues relating to the use of hypertext.\nThe three papers on hypertext discuss the effects\nof visible-link types on learning, knowledge\nconstruction and acquisition in customized\nhypermedia environments, and the relationship\nbetween hypertext learning environments and\nepistemic beliefs.\nI found the contents of this book extremely\ninteresting from both the point of view of topics\nand that of treatment. Obviously, the wide\nrange of writing styles encountered in a multi-\nauthor book of this type means that continuity\nand content often fluctuate from one chapter to\nanother. However, the editors have done a\nmasterly job in selecting and grouping papers,\nand in ensuring that a reasonably consistent\nstyle has been maintained.\nThe book is expensive (\u00a347.00 Sterling), so I\nhave to recommend it for a departmental library\nrather than for individual purchase, but I do so\nrecommend it.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nAspects of Educational and Training Technology,\nvolume XXVIII: Computer-assisted and Open\nAccess Education edited by F. Percival, R. Land\nand D. Edgar-Nevill, London, Kogan Page,\nISBN: 0-7494-1414-6, 1995.\nThis is a selection of the proceedings of the 1994\nInternational Conference of the Association for\nEducational and Training Technology (on\ncomputer-assisted and open-access education)\nhosted by Napier University in Edinburgh.\nAround 85 papers were presented at the\nconference; 44 have been reproduced in full in\nthis volume, with the inclusion of abstracts from\nthe rest. Reflecting the organization of the\nconference, the papers have been divided into\nfour sections: Perspectives on Teaching and\nLearning; Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL)\nand Computer-based Training (CBT);\nMultimedia and Hypermedia; and Open and\nDistance Learning. Discussions of political\nissues, underlying concepts, and project reports\nappear in each section.\nClearly, then, the conference attempted to cover\na lot of ground, and quite successfully on the\nevidence of these proceedings. As a result, the\nbook works effectively on two levels: as a useful\nupdate for experts, and as an informative\nintroduction for newcomers to any of the\nsubject areas described above. However, as the\neditors readily acknowledge, there is\nconsiderable overlap between these areas,\nleading to the somewhat arbitrary placement of\nsome papers.\nThe use of computer-based technology in the\nclassroom still continues to excite healthy\ndebate, as evidenced by some of the arguments\nadvanced in the first section. There are some\nwho predict a radical shift towards technology-\nbased solutions in the near future; others take a\nmore cautious approach. Separating those\ncontributors actually using the technology in\nteaching\/learning situations from the politicians\nmight assist the reader in evaluating the\narguments. It was also heartening to see the\nwork of Price, Hobbs and Cheah in which the\nuse of standard software-development control\nand quality assurance procedures are applied to\ncourseware development. All too often where\ncourseware development is concerned, software\ndesign is confused with interface design, often\nleading to predictably unfortunate conse-\nquences.\nSections 2 and 3 will be particularly useful to\nthose involved directly in the production of\nCAL\/CBT packages. Many of the papers here\ndescribe applications of some of the better-\nknown authoring tools, such as ToolBook and\nGuide, and the inclusion of a large number of\nscreenshots gives the reader a real feel for what\nis taking place. Jacquetta Megarry's paper on\ndesign challenges is particularly refreshing,\nquestioning the indiscriminate use of resource-\nhungry video in desktop packages. Section 4 is\nagain largely project-based. The final section,\ncontaining the abstracts, may certainly prove\nuseful, as readers may obtain full papers from\nthe authors, though (given this) the inclusion of\nfull addresses here would obviously have been\nhelpful. The selection criteria used to determine\nwhether a paper was included in full or in\nabstract form are not included.\nThe volume has been produced to a very high\nstandard. The hardback format combined with\ngood quality print and paper give substance to a\n77\nReviews\nbook which would be a very useful purchase on\nthe basis of content alone.\nLorraine Warren, University of Humberside\nGroupwork in Education and Training: Ideas in\nPractice by Michael Reynolds, London, Kogan\nPage, ISBN: 0-7494-1027-2, 1994.\nThe intended audience for this book is broad. It\nis aimed at practitioners involved in education\nand training who use, or want to use, group-\nwork methods, and anyone interested in the\nsocial, psychological or educational processes\nassociated with group work. The author states\nthe overall purpose of the book as being 'to\nmake sense of the complex array of ideas,\nmethods and issues' associated with designing\nand using group activities, and 'making sense of\nthe consequences of using them\".\nMy overall verdict is positive. I enjoyed reading\nthe book, and on several occasions it challenged\nmy assumptions about the way I work with\ngroups. The one downside lies in the fact that\nthe subject area is vast, and to do justice to all\naspects of it would need substantially more than\nthe 138 pages of this book. To be fair to the\nauthor, however, he acknowledges that he has\ngone for breadth rather than depth, and he gives\nexcellent references for following up particular\npoints of interest. As an overview of the subject,\nthen, it offers a well constmcted, easy-to-read\naccount of many of the key issues.\nChapter 1 addresses the question of why\nsomeone might want to use group methods in\nthe educational process. It offers a description\nof the different types of group methodologies\n(for example, simulations, discussions, and\naction learning) and how they differ. The\nauthor concludes that the key reason why group\nwork is so valuable is that it enables learning to\nbe 'grounded in the personal and social\nexperience' of the learner, and that it places the\nresponsibility and (to different degrees) control\nof the learning in his or her hands.\nChapter 2 focuses on the design of group work\nand looks at what factors actually contribute to\nthe learning outcomes of a group session. The\nauthor's key point is that while the design is\nimportant, the outcomes can be influenced by a\ngreat many things, such as participant\nexpectations, the group's history or the social\ncontext - good comfort for those of us who\nagonize over 'failed' designs!\nChapter 3 gives an excellent overview of some\nof the theories that underpin group work. The\nauthor emphasizes how important it is for\ntrainers and teachers to be aware of the\nassumptions, values and beliefs that inform\ntheir approach (theories are seldom value-free),\nand adds that no single school of thought is the\n'unarguable truth'. He summarizes a few of the\nmodels in current use which can act as a good\nstarting point for observing the behaviour of\ngroups, and sets out some complex ideas simply,\nthough I found that his description of how to\napply these models in practice was less clear.\nChapters 4, 5 and 6 offer examples from\npractice which are intended to illustrate some of\nthe issues associated with learning groups which\ntend to be neglected. These chapters make a\nnumber of key points which made me think.\nThe first is that whatever the intended focus of\nan activity, the actual experience of it will be\nbroader, as participants relate it to their own\nindividual experience\/circumstance. The second\npoint is that it is easy to assume that there are\nneat boundaries that can be drawn around\nparticular group activities. However, that so\nmany such activities have unintended\nconsequences points to the fact that they are\noften not as 'bounded' as one might imagine.\nThe final point, is that the design of a group\nsession inevitably transmits to participants\ncertain social values (for example, about who is\nin control, what is\/is not open to influence). I\nfound these chapters very thought-provoking.\nChapter 7 looks at some of the newest\napproaches to group work, and takes the form\nof a series of 'interviews' between the author\nand practitioners who are using these methods.\nI found the descriptions a little too cursory to be\nvery useful, but they act well as an introduction\nto the subject areas.\nThis very well-written book is, therefore, a good\nintroduction to the area of group work, and\nalthough a little superficial in places, it raises\nsome important issues.\nMarion Gillie Partner, Sheppard Moscow Ltd\nManagement Consultants (Tel: 0181 468 7975)\nTeaching and Learning with Audio in Open and\nDistance Learning by Derek Rowntree, London,\nKogan Page (Open and Distance Learning\nSeries), ISBN: 0-7494-1154-6, 1994.\nThis publication is an audio-print package\nintended for teachers and trainers. It consists of\n78\nVolume 3 Number I\na book of 124 pages together with an audio\ncassette, presented together in a durable book-\nsize container. The audio cassette contains\nexamples of audio teaching which are referred\nto in the book. Side A contains fifteen short\nclips as illustrative material; Side B contains two\nmore extensive examples.\nAs might be expected from an author with\nDerek Rowntree's background and experience,\nboth the book and the audio tape are\nintroduced in a way which gives excellent,\nfriendly study guidance to users of the package.\nThe tape begins with a personal introduction\nand advice from the author on how best to\nstudy the material, and the book opens, as all\ngood training packages should, with a statement\nof aims and objectives. This is followed\nimmediately by a concise summary of the\noverall organization of the package and a\nrestatement of the study advice given on the\naudio tape.\nThe package is divided into five parts: (1) the\ncase for using audio; (2) examples of the\ndiversity of audio teaching; (3) examples of\nextended audio teaching and their analysis; (4)\nmaking your own audio package; and (5)\nevaluating audio packages. The book also\nincludes a list of 17 specialist references which\nare relevant to the use of audio packages in\nteaching and training. In each case, the author\nhas indicated how that reference might be useful.\nAt an early stage, Rowntree emphasizes that\ngood audio tuition will probably make use of\nboth the sense of hearing and sight, and this is\nreflected in the exemplary material he has\nchosen. In Part 1, he reviews the potential\nobjectives of using audio in teaching, either as an\naural source or combined with visual materials\nand activities. This section is typical of the book\nas a whole, in that the layout is pleasing and\nwell-organized, with excellent use of different\nfonts, borders and headings to distinguish\nauthor contributions from examples, and\nsomething like 20 per cent of the pages in the\nbook feature diagrams and drawings referred to\nin the taped examples. I stress the appearance of\nthe book because it is presented and structured\nas a self-study package rather than as a textbook\nwith accompanying audio tape. Excellent use is\nmade of boxed instructions and reminders\nwithin the formal textual materials so that the\nbehaviour and thoughts of users can be\nappropriately organized. This means that the\npackage is free standing and ready for\nimmediate use by interested tutors or by\nstudents following courses in educational\ntechnology or flexible and open learning, and I\nshall have no hesitation in offering this package\nto my own students.\nThe taped extracts in Part 2 illustrate the use of\naudio for listening, for listening and looking,\nand for listening and doing. In each case, the\ntext poses questions for readers to consider as\nthe tape is listened to, and then comments on\nthe extract afterwards. One very useful feature is\nthat the text then invites readers to consider\nhow they might use the strategy they have just\nlistened to in their own teaching.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the illustrative\nexamples are all examples of good practice -\nthere is no attempt to create a somewhat\nartificial exercise of comparing good and bad\npractice. However, Part 3 of the package does\ncompare and contrast two extended examples of\ngood practice using different techniques. Both\nillustrate techniques unique to audio, and could\nnot easily be provided by alternative means.\nThe final two sections give clear advice on how\nto prepare and evaluate audio packages,\nrepresent an excellent compilation of good\npractice in the audio field, and are sufficiently\ndetailed to allow an instructor to use audio for\nthe first time.\nIt will by now be clear that I was very impressed\nwith the overall quality of this package: its\nexcellent study guidance (both in the text and on\nthe audio tape), and the integration between the\ntext and the audio tape. My single quibble is with\nthe price (\u00a319.95 Sterling) which is presumably\nrelated to a potentially limited sales volume.\nEquivalent text plus audio packages in modern\nlanguages are much more modestly priced.\nDennis Moss, University of Wales, Cardiff\nUsing Communications Media in Open and\nFlexible Learning by Robin Mason, London,\nKogan Page (Open and Distance Learning\nSeries), ISBN: 0-7494-1149-X, 1994.\nAs the range of available educational\ntechnologies and their respective proponents\nmultiply, so does the need for some rational and\nenlightened view on what these technologies\noffer those who are engaged in the process of\neducation. Mason's book, as part of the Open\nand Distance Learning Series, provides this\n79\nReviews\nevaluation for the subset of educational\ntechnologies she calls communication media.\nThe book is intended as an introduction to the\nsubject. It has approximately 120 pages of\ncontent, and is quick and easy to read. It\ncontains eight chapters, an annotated\nbibliography and an index. The structure is both\nlogical and straightforward. The first chapter\ndiscusses the uses of telecommunications media\nin education, and introduces the three main\napproaches to using them (computer\nconferencing, audiographics and video-\nconferencing). The following two chapters are\ndevoted to the important issues of interactivity\nand the implications of using these technologies.\nMason then considers each of the technologies\nin subsequent chapters using similar section\nheadings for consistency. The penultimate\nchapter describes nine live projects that are\ncurrently using these techniques. The\nconcluding chapter explains why the different\ntechnologies do not compete with each other,\nand gives some advice on best practice.\nIn chapter 2, Mason gives her personal view on\nwhat attributes of interactivity are desirable in an\neducational context, and evaluates these for\ncomputer conferencing, audiographics and\nvideoconferencing. The view taken is the\nconstructivist one - that interactivity can\nenhance learning. The author proceeds to explain\nhow these technologies can facilitate collabora-\ntive working and help cultivate a social presence.\nChapter 4 examines the implications for those\nusing and developing communications-media\napplications in education, and the overriding\nmessage is that using these technologies can be\nvery rewarding for students and staff alike, but\nthat it requires commitment and hard work. The\nmessage to organizations is that these\ntechnologies do not necessarily mean cost\nsavings, and that they must provide appropriate\nsupport and investment in infrastructure.\nChapter 5 explores computer conferencing by\noutlining the current state of the technology, its\neducational uses and its advantages and\ndisadvantages. The impression given is that\ncomputer conferencing is the most accessible of\nthe three technologies and is also the most\neducationally effective. Chapter 6 examines\naudiographics following the themes of the\nanalysis introduced in the previous chapter.\nAudio and graphics seem to work well together,\nthe graphics being the focal point for audio\ninteraction - analogous to the OHP in a\nconventional lecture. Currently, the main use\nfor audiographics seems to be for connecting\nsmaller groups to larger centres for tutorial\npurposes, but trends suggest that this\nfascinating technology has quite a promising\nfuture, especially when combined with\nmultimedia functionality. Chapter 7 discusses\nthe educational uses of video-conferencing;\nunfortunately, this is limited (perhaps reflecting\nthe cost of the technology?). The section on\nadvantages concludes that one-way video\nconferencing facilitates didactic lecture-delivery\nover a wide area with the potential of reaching\na large audience, while two-way video-\nconferencing is best reserved for small tutorial\ngroups. Mason suggests that visual communica-\ntion courses are probably best suited for\nexploiting videoconferencing techniques.\nA chapter concerned with live project case\nstudies is very useful and puts the material\ncovered in previous chapters into context. The\ncase studies come from all over the world and,\ntaken together, are inspiring. Each project\nincludes an evaluation of its educational\neffectiveness with pointers for success, though it\nwould have been interesting to have had more\ninformation on the curriculum design aspects of\nthe projects.\nIn the concluding chapter, Mason is emphatic\nabout the fact that the three technologies\ndiscussed in her book do not compete with each\nother. Each technology supports different\nlearning styles, and the context in which they\nare used is different. Good pragmatic and\npedagogic reasons are given for adopting these\ntechnologies. Communication media are\nimportant elements in the emergence of a new\ntype of learning environment ('close distance\neducation') that will capture the best of our\nconventional learning environments and our\nnewer open and distance learning systems. The\nbook finishes with some best-practice advice.\nMason's clear intention with this book is to\nprovide an easily accessible introduction to\ncommunications media for education, and this\nshe does very successfully. Specialists and non-\nspecialists alike will find the book easy to\nunderstand, and it may even inspire them to try\nout the technologies for themselves. Indeed, it\nwill most likely leave many readers with the\nquestion: 'How do I redesign my course to\ninclude one of these technologies?'\nGeoff Elliott, Cardiff Institute of Higher\nEducation\n80\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nComputer-based Learning in Science -\nProceedings of the International Conference\nCBLIS '95 edited by Graham M. Chapman,\nOpen Education and Sciences, Opava, Czech\nRepublic, ISBN: 80-901974-0-X, 1995.\nCBLIS '95 was held in Opava (Czech Republic)\nin July 1995, and provided a forum for\nresearchers and practitioners interested in\ntechnology-based science education. The\nproceedings consist of 60 contributions selected\nfrom a total of 110 papers originally submitted\nfor review.\nThe papers are grouped into 11 sections which\nvary greatly in size - from a single paper\n(forming the section on Intelligent Software) to\n12 papers (in the section on Teaching Packages).\nThis reflects quite well the focus of research in\ncomputer-based education generally, where\nsolutions are required relatively quickly to\naddress current teaching problems. Systems\nutilizing aspects of artificial intelligence, on the\nother hand, can have significant time, cost and\ncomplexity overheads due to the additional\ndimension of embedded 'intelligence'. As a\nresult, far fewer projects aim at using potentially\nuseful techniques drawn from the field of\nartificial intelligence.\nThe first section (Invited Lectures) consists of\nfour invited contributions which provide a\nbroad overview of some important issues arising\nfrom the development of computer-based\neducation in science. In this review, I shall\npresent a short summary of each of the invited\npapers before providing a brief guide to the\nremaining sections of the book.\nIn the opening paper by Philip Barker, the main\nissues covered concern cognitive engineering\nand interface design. Some of the key cognitive\nengineering concepts introduced here are mental\nmodels, learning styles and the use of\nmetaphors. Interface design issues explored by\nBarker include interactivity, graphical user-\ninterfaces, hypermedia, and intelligent\ninterfaces. Each of these issues is discussed in\nthe context of designing human-computer\ninterfaces to support effective learning.\nThe second of the invited papers, by Graham\nChapman, provides a brief review of some\nrecent trends in computer-based learning and\nhardware development. Chapman places\nconsiderable emphasis on a few key issues and\nidentifies the use of expert computer program-\nmers as perhaps his most important message.\nChapman argues that expert programmers must\nbe used, and that the production of quality\ncourseware necessarily involves a close co-\noperation between academics who are subject\nexperts and computer programmers who\nprovide production expertise.\nMilos Lansky takes a somewhat philosophical\nview of computers in education in the third of\nthe invited contributions. Lansky makes\nparallels between the work of Comenius (a\nsixteenth-century Czech scholar) and computer-\nbased learning. This analysis results in nine\nstatements (or guidelines) which indicate that\nhistorically important pedagogical concerns\nremain relevant in computer-based learning.\nThe final invited paper, by Peter Wright,\naddresses the problems surrounding educating\nthe educators. Here the main concern is the\npreparation of technologically literate teachers\nwho can act as both advocates and role models\nfor the use of computers in education. Both in-\nservice and pre-service teacher training are\nconsidered as means by which teachers in\ngeneral can become catalysts in the widening\neducational use of the new technologies.\nIt is impractical to present a detailed discussion\nof the wide range of topics addressed in the\nremaining sections of the proceedings. Since\nsome effort has been made to organize the\nproceedings into sections, however, a list of the\nareas covered can provide an indication of\ncontent. Topics addressed are: (a) Review\nLectures (b) Teaching and Learning:\nEducational Strategy (c) Teaching and\nLearning: CBL Structures (d) Monitoring of\nPerformance (e) Software and Hardware\nDevelopments (f) Intelligent Software (g)\nTeaching Packages (h) Teaching with\nSimulation (i) Interactive Programmes (j)\nNetworking and Distance Learning. The book\nalso has a preface, contents list and author\nindex.-The preface is light, to say the least, and\ngives little more than the location of the\nconference and the names of the organizers,\npapers committee and sponsors. The inclusion\nof an author index will be of use, though (in line\nwith many proceedings) the absence of a\ntraditional index prevents the work being used\nefficiently as a reference source (perhaps the\nmain use to which academic books of this kind\nare put).\nEven better than the inclusion of an index,\nhowever, would be availability on CD-ROM\nalong with an appropriate search engine. This\n81\nReviews\nwould allow the primary target audience of the\nbook, academics, to use the information\neffectively in their work. The falling costs of\nCD-ROM publication could make this a viable\noption for many conference proceedings and\nwould greatly increase their utility.\nCopies of these proceedings can be obtained\nfrom: Open Education & Sciences, PO Box 84,\n746 20 Opava, Czech Republic.\nStephen Richards, University of Teesside\nISDN Applications in Education and Training\nedited by Robin Mason and Paul Bacsich,\nLondon, The Institution of Electrical Engineers,\nISBN: 0-85296-860-4, 1994.\nThis is an edited collection of papers describing\nthe exploitation of ISDN for distance\neducation. It is unfortunate that the publisher\nchose to print the acronym ISDN in huge letters\non both the spine and the front of the book\nsince it misleads the bookshop browser. It is not\na book primarily about ISDN, though it does\ndescribe the benefits and limitations resulting\nfrom its exploitation in education and training.\nA summary on the back of the book explains\nISDN:\nIntegrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is\nthe provision of a digital-based coupling between\ntwo sites, using the ordinary telephone network\nand the existing twisted-pair cables into\ncustomers' premises, for the purpose of conveying\ndata at a relatively high speed as a cost-effective\nalternative to high-speed leased communication\nlines. As a result it provides a motion-video\ncommunication link operating at several frames a\nsecond (using special compression\/decompression\nhardware) to organisations that would otherwise\nbe unable to justify a leased line.\nWhile the importance of this infrastructure\nprovision must not be understated, the excessive\nenthusiasm over ISDN in this book is\nunwarranted, and the subject is often needlessly\nincorporated. However, this comment should\nnot put off the potential buyer looking for a\nsource of information that explains the\nramifications of exploiting ISDN as a\ntransmission medium for both passive and\ninteractive distance learning.\nThe book consists of 13 chapters divided into\nthree sections, plus a concluding chapter, an\nindex and an extensive glossary.\nThe first section introduces the nomenclature of\ndigital communication standards. It identifies\nthe requirements for fast transmission of text,\nimages and speech, together with the possibility\nof exploiting data compression techniques. The\nproblem of re-synchronizing speech (which is\ndifficult to compress) with its corresponding\nmoving image (which is not so difficult to\ncompress) is briefly mentioned. Since basic-rate\nISDN is not capable of transmitting television-\nquality video in real time, various compromises\nare described (e.g. using monochrome only, or\naccepting a jerkily changing image) with\nparticular reference to their use in education\nand training. This first section also describes\nwhat is meant by audiographics, video-\nconferencing and computer conferencing, and\nrelates them to their exploitation in education\nand training. Some interesting views on the\nfuture methods of teaching are expressed,\nincluding the fundamental need for interaction\nin order for learning and monitoring to take\nplace.-The section ends with a world view as to\nwhich countries have adopted ISDN, its\ncontinued and future use as a means of com-\nmunicating information not specifically targeted\nat education and training, and ISDN's strategic\nrelationship with leased lines, local-area\nnetworks, and so on. The issue as to whether\nbasic-rate ISDN is fast enough is revived at the\nvery end of the section with views as to how\nspeed improvements will become available at a\ncost that is affordable for educational establish-\nments and for students located at home.\nVideoconferencing provides for two-way audio\nand video communication, and Section 2\nconsists of six chapters, each with a different\nperspective on this facility. The first describes a\nuniversity's provision for staff members at two\nmajor companies to participate in the\nuniversity's courses. The organizational issues,\nthe perceived benefits, and three common\nlecturing approaches are discussed. There are\nproblems (e.g. reliance on last-minute prepara-\ntion, and ignoring off-campus students), but we\nare told that these are largely overcome by\ncoaching the lecturers into handling this new\nenvironment. The next three chapters describe\nthe exploitation of videoconferencing in the\nBritish Isles, Australia and Norway, the main\nrationale for this exploitation being to provide\nimportant courses 'to a dispersed student\npopulation with a thinly distributed demand'.\nThe descriptions are mainly about the\nequipment and technical formats involved, but\n82\nALT-J Vo\/ume 3 Number I\nthere is also some focus on the way in which this\nmethod of teaching changes work patterns. For\nexample, it 'encouraged students to become\nmore responsible for their own learning\npatterns' and 'promoted group cohesiveness and\ngroup independence from the tutor*. There is\nalso some emphasis on the lecturers' concerns\nabout videoconferencing and their perceived\nbenefits of the medium, and comments about\nthe technology degrading the prepared visual\nmaterial so that special care has to be taken\nover its preparation. For most of these systems,\nthe lecturer was physically present in a lecture\ntheatre teaching a group of students, with the\nother students located at centres with two-way\naudio-visual links, but a French system had the\nlecturer shut in a booth remote from any\nstudent. The natural consequence of this\nisolation was that the apprehension of being in\nfront of a live audience was diluted. It is a very\n'presidential' style, but does 'allow you to\nconcentrate on (giving) the lecture', though\nstudents did demand a greater degree of\ninteraction with the lecturer.\nSection 2 also contains a cost-benefit analysis of\nvideoconferencing for both companies and\nuniversities. It is based on a range of equipment\nand a range of features available. The analysis\nincludes illustrations of various jobs from\nfactory-floor training through engineering to\nsales and management, and should offer helpful\narguments for adopting videoconferencing in\nboth industry and academe.\nThis second section covers distributed lecturing\nwith the opportunity for students at remote sites\nto ask questions. Section 3, in contrast,\ndescribes systems in which students are more\nparticipative. These systems involve the techno-\nlogy of computer-supported co-operative work\nbased on personal computers. Teacher and\nstudents share the same information displayed\non their own computers, and of course there is\nan audio link. One of the systems described\nenables a shared window to display the output\nof a program so that, for example, a number of\npeople can experience the hands-on learning of\na drawing program; the locus of control passes\nfrom teacher to student and back again as the\nlearning progresses. Various scenarios, are\ndescribed to illustrate the usefulness of such a\nsystem. Unfortunately, it seems, each window\ntook many seconds to update, and the teacher\nhad to' fill in while each person's computer\nsynchronized, making the whole session much\nlonger than if it had been face to face. A view of\nparticipants' faces was not felt to be too\nimportant although the absence of some turn-\ntaking cues caused minor problems.\nSection 3 generally reviews teleconferencing,\naudiographics and computer conferencing, and\nconcludes that 'conversation represents the\nstrongest underlying paradigm for any\ncomputer-mediated form of collaborative\nlearning'. Nevertheless, the lack of visual cues\nmeans that tutors will adopt a more\ninterrogative style in order to monitor the\n'presence' of students than they would need to\ndo in face-to-face tutorials. Two systems\ndesigned to support collaborative learning are\ndescribed. One was an attempt to integrate, in\none system, audio teleconferencing, audio-\ngraphics and computer conferencing, where\neach student sees on his or her personal\ncomputer a resource centre consisting of\nlectures whose material (slides and drawings)\nhas been previously down-line loaded and the\nlive lecture then given via a two-way audio link,\na 'meeting room' within which participants can\norally discuss and present documents, a 'study\nroom' in which the tutor can observe the state\nof each learner's computer screen.a conven-\ntional computer-conferencing tool, and a\nmultimedia resource library. The view is\nexpressed that social interaction is an essential\ncomponent of the learning process and that\ninformal peer learning is as important as formal\nteaching.\nIs the book worth buying? It certainly should be\nbought by libraries and retained on their shelves\nfor decades to come, since it will become an\nimportant source of historical information\nrecording the pioneering days of distance\neducation using digital communication links.\nFor current educators, it does provide an\nintroduction to the transmissive technology at\npresent available, identifies whether it is useful\nto them, and describes how it has been\nexploited.\nIan Benest, University of York\n83\n"}
