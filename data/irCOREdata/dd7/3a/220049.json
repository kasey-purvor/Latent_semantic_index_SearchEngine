By raising the costs of travel and deterring some \nvisitors, visa restrictions hamper personal contact across borders, which is detrimental \nto trade and FDI. Employing a standard gravity-type model in a global dyadic country \nsample, I estimate that if one country unilaterally requires a visa from nationals of the \nother country with no reciprocal restriction in place by the partner country, this lowers \nbilateral trade and FDI by up to 19 and 25 per cent, respectively. If both countries \nrequire a visa from nationals of the other country, the effect on trade is larger, but less \nthan double, at up to 25 per cent, while the effect on FDI is essentially the same as for \nunilateral restrictions. With such substantial negative effects, it is at least questionable \nwhether many of the existing visa restrictions would pass a cost-benefit test. \n \nKey words: trade, investment, visa, gravity, travel. \n 3 \n1. Introduction \nVisa restrictions impose a great burden on affected travelers. There is the cost and \nhassle of applying for the visa either via post, which can take weeks or months to be \nprocessed, or in person, which implies travelling to the embassy or one of the few \nconsulates and waiting in the queue, possibly for hours. Employing professional visa \nservices can mitigate the non-pecuniary cost, but only at the expense of a greater \nfinancial cost. \nDo visa restrictions also impose substantial costs on the country restricting \naccess to its territory as well as on the country whose nationals face such restrictions? \nThis article tackles this question by analyzing the effect of visa restrictions on \nbilateral trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). It complements an existing \nanalysis of the effect that visa restrictions have on dyadic flows of travel (Neumayer \n2010). Yet, much of this travel will consist of tourists and without further analysis it is \nimpossible to assess the economic damage that visa restrictions inflict on affected \ncountries beyond the tourist sector. \nBilateral trade and FDI are likely to be negatively affected by visa restrictions. \nMuch of international trade requires personal contact with trading partners. Visa \nrestrictions render such physical contact more difficult as they raise the burden for \n(potential) foreign trading partners to enter the country. The same will apply to \nforeign economic actors potentially investing in the country imposing the visa \nrestriction. Almost by definition, the setting up of a direct investment abroad will not \nbe possible without personal contact between the investment partners from the two \ncountries. \nOne may of course argue that most trade and FDI will be sufficiently \neconomically profitable to compensate potential trading and investing partners for the \n 4 \ncosts imposed by visa restrictions. However, this presupposes that the partners have \nperfect information about potential gains to be made from trade and investment. Yet, \nsuch potential gains will often only be discovered after personal contact or after \nhaving visited the site of potential investment several times. Hence, visa restrictions \ncan damage a country\u2019s trade and FDI by rendering the discovery of mutually \nbeneficial economic opportunities more costly. Furthermore, in some, particularly \npoorer, countries a considerable part of international trade takes place in markets \nconcentrated close to the international border to neighboring countries. For such trade, \neven small additional costs such as the ones imposed by visa restrictions can defeat \nthe small profit margins of traders. \nThere are therefore good reasons to presume that visa restrictions damage \nbilateral trade and investment. It is perhaps surprising that no empirical analysis has \nhitherto tried to estimate the size of these negative effects. One reason for this is the \nwork effort involved in inputting data on visa restrictions for a global sample of \nnation-states. Fortunately, this paper\u2019s analysis can build on an existing dataset of visa \nrestrictions, which the author has assembled previously (Neumayer 2006). \nThis article finds that unilateral visa restrictions imposed by one country \nwithout reciprocal visa restrictions in the partner country reduce bilateral trade by up \nto 19 per cent, while such trade is estimated to be reduced by up to around 25 per cent \nif both countries have visa restrictions in place on travelers from the respective \npartner country. For bilateral FDI, the estimated effects are essentially the same for \nboth unilateral and bilateral visa restrictions at up to around 25 per cent. Not \nsurprisingly, the effects of visa restrictions on trade and investment are smaller than \nthe estimated effect of such restrictions on travel by visitors as reported in Neumayer \n(2011) who finds that, depending on the exact model specification chosen, visa \n 5 \nrestrictions reduce such travel by on average between 52 and 63 per cent. Since not all \ntrade and FDI is dependent on travelling into the partner countries and economic \nactors can in part substitute travel with other forms of communication and since much \nof foreign travel is not business-related, one would expect the effect of visa \nrestrictions to be smaller on trade and FDI than on foreign travel as such. \nFor reasons explained in the next section, in which I describe the research \ndesign in detail, the estimated effects on trade and FDI are likely to be upward biased. \nThe reason is that the visa restrictions variable is likely to be correlated with some \nother factors that affect trade and FDI and which I am not able to include in the \nestimation model despite including a very large set of control variables. For example, \nvisa restrictions may be in place because of bad relations between two countries or \ntheir governments, perhaps because of historical animosity or rivalry or a recent \nsouring of relations in the wake of political developments in one or both of the two \ncountries forming a dyad, not captured by any of the control variables. If so, the visa \nrestrictions would be more a symptom of another causal factor \u2013 a bad bilateral \nrelationship \u2013 hampering bilateral trade and FDI than a cause in itself. However, visa \nrestrictions are too much prevalent (with only 17 per cent of dyads entirely free of \nvisa restrictions) to simply represent the symptom of bad bilateral relationships. Given \nthat visa restrictions are thus unlikely to merely be symptomatic of bad relationships \nand exert a significant and sizeable effect on trade and FDI even after controlling for a \nvery wide range of factors that capture other aspects of dyadic relationships, the \nresults tentatively suggest that policy makers need to seriously consider the economic \ncosts visa restrictions impose on their economies. \n \n 6 \n2. Research Design \nTo estimate the effect of visa restrictions on bilateral trade and FDI, I employ a basic \ngravity-type model. The model is specified as follows: \n \nln ln ij ijij ij ij ij ijy contiguity sameregion samelanguage tradeagreementdist coloniallink= + + + + +\n \n ln _ [ \/ ]ij ij ijdiplomatic representation migrant stock BIT DTT+ + +  \n _ _ij ij i j ijvisa unilateral visa bilateral u v \u03b5+ + + +  \n \nThe dependent variable is the natural log of bilateral trade or bilateral FDI stocks of \nthe two partner countries i and j. Data on trade are taken from UN (2009), while the \nFDI stock data have been purchased from UNCTAD (2009) and complemented with \ndata from OECD (2009).1 The dependent variables are average values between 2005 \nand 2007 (trade) or between 2005 and 2008 (FDI), while the explanatory variables all \nrefer to values of 2004 or the closest prior year available. \nAs is typical for most gravity-type models (see, for example, de Groot et al. \n2004; Baldwin and Taglioni 2006; Linders and de Groot 2006; Rose 2007; Kleinert \nand Toubal 2010; Zwinkels and Beugelsdijk 2010), I include the log of distance \nbetween the two partner countries in the estimation equation ( ln ijdist ) and dummy \nvariables for when the two countries are contiguous or separated by sea distance of \nless than 150 miles ( ijcontiguity ), for when the two countries are located in the same \nregion ( ijsameregion ), for when the two countries speak the same language as one of \ntheir main languages ( ijsamelanguage ), for when they share a (former) colonial link \n( ijcoloniallink ) and are joint members of a bilateral or regional trade agreement \n                                                 \n1\n Where they overlap, data from the two sources are very highly correlated at r = 0.99 with each other. \n 7 \n( ijtradeagreement ). Additionally, following Rose (2007) I include a measure of \ndiplomatic representation in the partner country, which varies from 0 to 2 (both are \nrepresented in each other\u2019s country), as well as the log of the bilateral number of \npermanent migrants originating from the respective foreign partner countries. All of \nthese variables are expected to have a positive effect on trade and FDI and their \ninclusion is important to prevent the visa restriction variable from spuriously picking \nup a geographical, cultural, political or historical relationship or account for the well \ndocumented fact that migrant networks exert a significant impact on bilateral trade \nand FDI (Jansen and Piermartini 2009).2 In other words, the purpose of these control \nvariables is to reduce the omitted variable bias discussed in detail below. For the FDI \nequation only, I additionally add a dummy variable for whether the two countries \nhave concluded either a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) or double taxation treaty \n(DTT) with each other ( \/ ijBIT DTT ), which have been demonstrated previously to \nhave a positive effect on FDI (Neumayer and Spess 2005; Neumayer 2007; Barthel, \nBusse and Neumayer 2010).3 \nVisa restrictions are measured by two dummy variables: one is set to one if \none of the two countries imposes visa restrictions on the other country, but not vice \nversa ( _ ijvisa unilateral ). The other dummy variable is set to one if both countries \nimpose visa restrictions on each other ( _ ijvisa bilateral ). The omitted reference \ncategory therefore refers to country pairs without visa restrictions on either side. This \nspecification allows testing for the hypothesis that visa restrictions in both countries \nshould have a more damaging effect on bilateral trade and FDI than unilateral visa \nrestrictions, but the effect of two visa restrictions may well be less than double the \n                                                 \n2\n Unfortunately, for lack of data I cannot control for temporary migration. \n3\n The strong correlation between BITs and DTTs mean that these cannot be estimated separately. \n 8 \neffect of unilateral visa restrictions, i.e. visa restrictions may have a diminishing \nmarginal negative effect. Finally, the fixed effects for both partner countries ( iu , jv ) \ncapture the general attractiveness of countries as trade and investment partners. They \ncan capture, amongst others, factors like the economic size and structure of countries \nas well as, to some extent, trade frictions (Anderson and van Wincoop 2003). \nData on distance come from Mayer and Zignago (2006). The variable \nmeasures distance in kilometers between the principal cities of countries weighted by \npopulation size, which thus takes into account the uneven spread of population across \na country. Data on contiguity are taken from Bennett and Stam (2005), while the \ngeographical classification largely follows the World Bank\u2019s (2009) grouping of \ncountries.4 The colonial ties dummy variable is taken from Perkins and Neumayer \n(2008). Data on language stem from CIA (2009), while information on bilateral and \nregional trade agreements has been sourced from the WTO (2009). Information on \ndiplomatic representation is taken from Bayer (2006), data on migration come from \nParsons et al. (2007). Data on BITs and DTTs are taken from Barthel, Busse and \nNeumayer (2010). Results are fully robust to including as further explanatory control \nvariables )ln( ji GDPGDP \u22c5 , i.e. the log of the product of the two country\u2019s economic \nsize as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the absolute difference between \nthe GDP per capita of both countries or dummy variables for combinations of political \nregime type in the two countries (democracy-democracy, democracy-autocracy, \nautocracy-autocracy).5 Data on GDP and GDP per capita are taken from World Bank \n(2009), while data on political regime type are taken from Freedom House (2009). \n                                                 \n4\n The major difference is that the United States and Canada do not constitute their own region, but are \npart of Northern and Central America, while South America forms a group of its own. \n5\n Results are available as part of the replication dataset available on http:\/\/personal.lse.ac.uk\/neumayer. \n 9 \nFully robust here means not only that the coefficients of the visa restrictions variables \nremain statistically significant (this is easy to achieve), but also that the substantive \nestimates do not change much. \nInformation on the main explanatory variables, bilateral visa restrictions, is \ntaken from the November 2004 edition of the International Civil Aviation \nAssociation\u2019s Travel Information Manual (IATA 2004). Used by the vast majority of \nairlines and travel bureaus, this manual provides authoritative information on \nrestrictions in place. Ideally, one would like to trace changes in restrictions over time, \nbut with approximately 33,000 relevant country pairs (dyads) doing so would be \nprohibitively costly in terms of effort (it took several months to input the existing \ndata).6 \nVisa restrictions are a fairly common phenomenon. Only about 17 per cent of \ncountry pairs are entirely free of such restrictions. In about 48 per cent of dyads, both \ncountries impose visa restrictions on each other, whilst in about 35 per cent of dyads \nthe restriction is unilateral. Western developed countries impose restrictions on \ntravelers from many more developing countries than their citizens face when \ntravelling to the developing world. The average Western citizen needs a visa for \ntravelling to around 93 foreign countries, whereas the average developing country \n                                                 \n6\n There are two types of visa restrictions. One is the usual or common type that needs to be applied for \nbefore travelling. The other, less common, type of visa can be applied for upon arrival at the border. \nThis latter type of visa typically does not represent any restriction at all since the procedure of getting it \nis extremely simple and does not involve any major check on the applicant. In fact, arguably its main \npurpose is to generate further revenue for the destination country rather than deterring foreign travellers \nfrom the countries facing such visa restrictions, even if the additional cost may of course deter some. \nSince visas that can be applied for at the border are very different from visas that need to be applied for \nin advance and before travelling, I will count only the latter as visa restrictions in the estimations. \n 10 \ncitizen can enter 156 foreign countries only with a visa. Maps 1 and 2 demonstrate the \ngeographical unevenness in the total number of visa restrictions a country imposes on \nforeign travellers and in the total number of restrictions its nationals face when \ntravelling abroad. Clearly, while such aggregated information does not do justice to \nthe complexity and variety of bilateral relationships between countries, the maps \nclearly demonstrate that access to foreign spaces is very unequal (Neumayer 2006). \nThe estimation of gravity-type models typically has to deal with two major \nproblems: first, an identification problem due to potential omitted variable bias; \nsecond, a potential sample selection problem due to the absence of information on \nbilateral trade and FDI in many dyads. I discuss both problems in turn. Starting with \nthe identification problem, if variables that both have an influence on trade and FDI \nand are correlated with the explanatory variables of the estimation model are omitted \nfrom the specification, then this will cause omitted variable bias (OVB). In principle \nthe bias can go both ways, but there are good reasons to presume that OVB will bias \nthe estimated coefficients of the variable(s) of interest upwards (Baldwin and Taglioni \n2006). Bilateral trade and investment costs, for example, will impact trade and FDI, \nbut are impossible to measure correctly. Baldwin and Taglioni (2006) therefore \nsuggest including dyad fixed effects as well as time-varying nation fixed effects in the \nestimation model to deal with the identification problem. However, because the visa \nrestrictions variable is time-invariant, dyad fixed effects cannot be included in the \nestimations. This would hold true even if one collected data on visa restrictions for \nother years, which is very time-consuming. The reason is that there will be little \nwithin-variation (variation over time) since practically all of the variation of the visa \n 11 \nrestriction variable will be dominated by between-variation (variation across dyads).7 \nGiven dyad fixed effects are impossible, I try to reduce OVB as much as possible by \nincluding nation dummies for both partner countries, which control for the general \ntrade and FDI openness of countries, and as many dyadic explanatory variables other \nthan visa restrictions as possible. This cannot solve the identification problem, but it \nreduces it as much as possible. \nAs concerns the problem that for some dyads in the case of bilateral trade and \nfor many dyads in the case of bilateral FDI no data are reported (Frankel 1997), the \nmost common practice seems to be recoding the missing values to zero or simply \nignoring these observations and estimating the gravity model on dyads which report \nstrictly positive trade or FDI values (Linders and Groot 2006). Both measures are \nequivalent since the log of zero is undefined. However, doing this can lead to biased \ncoefficient estimates due to sample selection. Bias is also likely to follow from \nsubstituting missing or zero values with an arbitrarily chosen small constant so that \nthe natural log of these observations is defined (Linders and Groot 2006). \nThere is no entirely satisfactory solution to this problem since the missing \nvalues could be because either trade or FDI is truly zero or because it is non-zero, but \nrelatively small and escapes the statistical reporting or because it is non-reported for \nother reasons. Two major estimation models for dealing with the issue are the Tobit \nmodel (Tobin 1958) and Heckman\u2019s (1979) sample-selection model.  \nThe Tobit model would be appropriate if desired trade or FDI between some \npartner countries were negative and, since this is impossible, became censored to \nzero. This would be a very strange assumption to make, however. The Tobit model \ncould also be appropriate if reported trade or FDI values got rounded to zero, i.e. \n                                                 \n7\n Technically, dyad fixed effects could be included in this case, but with hardly any within variation in \nthe visa restrictions variable, no valid coefficient can be estimated in such a model. \n 12 \ntruncated if they fall beyond a small value. My sources for trade and FDI do not \nactually report any values of zero, but one could argue that very small values do in \nfact become truncated and are converted by the two data sources into missing data \nrather than zero values. The problem is that no one really knows whether non-reported \nvalues for dyads means very small values that became truncated or whether these \nvalues have not been reported for other reasons. \nHeckman\u2019s sample-selection model works via estimating the determinants into \nbeing selected into the sample simultaneously with estimating the determinants of the \nlevels of trade and FDI for the dyads selected into the sample. It is in principle quite a \nsuitable model if there were a variable that has a strong effect on the likelihood of \nbeing selected, but no effect on the level stage (the so-called exclusion restriction). \nThe problem is that it is unclear what such a variable is supposed to be. In its absence, \nidentification of the model depends on the non-linearity of one of the estimated \nparameters, namely the so-called inverse mills ratio, which some regard as more \nproblematic (Verbeek 2000; Wooldridge 2002) than others (Leung and Yu 1996). \nStill, compared to the Tobit alternative, the Heckman model appears to provide the \nsuperior option. The main model is therefore estimated with ordinary least squares \n(OLS) on dyads that report positive trade and FDI values only, whereas a further \nmodel is estimated with Heckman\u2019s sample selection model to check the robustness of \nthe findings from the main model. \n \n3. Results \nTable 1 presents the regression results. Column 1 refers to OLS estimation for the log \nof bilateral trade, column 4 to the log of bilateral FDI stocks as dependent variables. I \nfirst concentrate on these estimation results, before briefly discussing the results on \n 13 \nthe Heckman sample-selection estimations reported in columns 2-3 and 5-6, \nrespectively. \nFocusing first on the control variables, with one exception results are in line \nwith expectations and previous findings: more distant countries have lower trade and \nFDI, while contiguous countries, countries that share a former colonial link, countries \nthat speak the same language, countries with a larger number of permanent migrants \nfrom the respective partner countries and countries with good political relations (as \napproximated by diplomatic representation) all have more trade and FDI, as expected. \nControlling for these factors, being located in the same macro-region does not exert a \nstatistically significant effect (the exception mentioned above).8 Joint membership in \na bilateral or regional trade agreement raises bilateral trade, but not FDI. The \nexistence of a BIT or DTT is associated with higher FDI. \nAs concerns the main variables of interest, unilateral and bilateral visa \nrestrictions lower both trade and FDI. For trade, the effect of bilateral visa restrictions \nis stronger than the effect of unilateral restrictions, but it is less than double the effect \nof unilateral visa restrictions: an F-test rejects the hypothesis that the coefficient size \nof _ ijvisa bilateral  on travel is twice that of _ ijvisa unilateral  at a p-level of 0.04. \nThis suggests that visa restrictions have a diminishing marginal negative effect on \ntrade. For FDI, the effect of unilateral and bilateral visa restrictions are essentially the \nsame in OLS estimations. A possible explanation for this finding is that whereas \nbilateral trade is essentially symmetric, bilateral FDI stocks are often very asymmetric \nin many dyads, particularly between developed and developing countries, where \nalmost the entire stock comes from one of the two partner countries only. Taking into \n                                                 \n8\n This variable is correlated with contiguity and distance and if these variables were dropped from the \nmodel, then the same region variable becomes statistically significant with a positive coefficient sign. \n 14 \naccount the necessary correction for the interpretation of estimated dummy variable \ncoefficients in semi-logarithmic equations (see Kennedy 1981), unilateral visa \nrestrictions are estimated to reduce trade by about 17.5 per cent, while the effect of \nbilateral visa restrictions is estimated at approximately 25 per cent. For FDI, both \nunilateral and bilateral restrictions are estimated to reduce bilateral FDI stocks by \naround 32 to 35 per cent. \nColumns 2 and 3 report results for trade from the Heckman maximum \nlikelihood sample-selection model for the level and selection stages, respectively. \nBeing located in the same macro-region, which was insignificant in the OLS \nregression, continues to be insignificant at the level stage, but is a marginally \nsignificant predictor of the existence of trade at the selection stage. Contiguity has an \nunexpected negative effect on the existence of trade in the selection equation, but the \noverall effect on trade is positive, as one would expect. Otherwise, results are \nconsistent in terms of coefficient sign and statistical significance with the results from \nthe OLS estimation. The Wald test clearly rejects the hypothesis of independent \nequations, which means that the Heckman model, which estimates both stages \nsimultaneously, is preferable over a (non-reported) two-part model, in which both \nstages of the estimation would be estimated separately and independently. The effect \nof visa restrictions can no longer be easily computed from the reported coefficients of \nthe relevant dummy variables since it is a compound of its impact on the selection and \non the level equations. Applying the formula in Sigelman and Zeng (1999: 177),9 \nunilateral visa restrictions are estimated to reduce bilateral trade by 19 per cent, while \nthe effect of bilateral visa restrictions is around 28 per cent, i.e. close to the estimated \nvalues for OLS regression. \n                                                 \n9\n Alternatively, one can employ the \u201cmfx compute, pred(ycond)\u201d command in Stata. \n 15 \nColumns 5 and 6 report Heckman estimation results for FDI. Conditional on \nthe other explanatory variables, countries that are common partners in a regional trade \nagreement are more likely to have bilateral FDI stocks. Otherwise results are \nconsistent with the OLS estimations. The Wald test again rejects the hypothesis of \nindependent equations. The estimated effect is around 25 per cent for both unilateral \nand bilateral visa restrictions, i.e. somewhat smaller than the estimated effects for the \nOLS regression. Given the large share of censored observations, the lower estimated \neffects from the Heckman model are probably closer to the true effects. The estimated \neffects also corroborate the result from the OLS estimations that for the often highly \nasymmetric bilateral FDI stocks unilateral visa restrictions have already essentially \nthe same negative effect as bilateral restrictions. \nThe essential symmetry of bilateral trade allows me to indirectly test the \nargument that visa restrictions have a detrimental impact on trade in part because of \nthe additional financial burden they impose on travelers. If this argument is correct, \nthen the effect of visa restrictions on trade in dyads in which both partner countries \nare from the developing world should be stronger than in dyads in which at least one \ncountry is from the developed world, whose nationals can arguably more easily \nshoulder the extra burden of paying for, say, a visa services company to obtain the \nvisa on their behalf. In an extension to the model reported in column 1 of table 1, in \nwhich I estimated separate visa restriction effects for developing country dyads on the \none hand and dyads in which at least one partner is a developed country on the other, I \nfind indeed that the effects are much stronger in the former set of dyads than in the \nothers (detailed results not reported, but included in the replication dataset). This also \ntentatively suggests that visa restrictions do not merely pick up an underlying effect of \ngood bilateral relationships not captured by some of the control variables since there \n 16 \nis no reason why such an omitted variable effect would systematically differ between \nthese two sets of country dyads. \n \n4. Conclusion \nThis article has extended standard gravity-type models of trade and FDI (see, for \nexample, de Groot et al. 2004; Baldwin and Taglioni 2006; Linders and de Groot \n2006; Rose 2007; Jansen and Piermartini 2009; Zwinkels and Beugelsdijk 2010; \nKleinert and Toubal 2010) by including a further dyadic relationship that is likely to \nimpact bilateral trade and FDI stocks, namely visa restrictions. The estimated \ncoefficients of the visa restrictions variables and the substantive effects following \nfrom them need to be treated with some caution due to the identification problem \ndescribed in detail above. The specification of the estimation model has tried to \nreduce omitted variable bias as much as possible, but it cannot eliminate it. The \nchallenge for future research is to reduce this bias even further by including other \ndyad-specific variables with which visa restrictions are correlated and which also \nmight impact bilateral trade and FDI. \nTentatively accepting the estimated effects, which are substantial but not \nabsurdly high, visa restrictions do not only appear to impose a burden on affected \ntravelers, they also impact the economies of countries that impose the restrictions and \nof countries whose nationals are faced with visa restrictions. Given the negative \neffects of visa restrictions, the question is why do countries impose visa restrictions at \nall? Neumayer (2006) argues that they are meant to reduce actual or perceived \nsecurity concerns by preventing persona non grata from entering the country. \nHowever, they are a very blunt instrument as they deter many others who would bring \neconomic and other benefits to the country and will often not prevent the entrance of \n 17 \nthose who are meant to be kept out. For example, the 9\/11 terrorists all entered the US \non valid visas. I contend that many existing visa restrictions, particularly those in \ncountries dependent on foreign visitors, trade and foreign investment, would not pass \na cost-benefit test and more research is needed on why states maintain restrictions that \nprima facie would appear not to be in their own economic interest. \n 18 \nAcknowledgement \nHelpful comments from two reviewers are gratefully acknowledged.
