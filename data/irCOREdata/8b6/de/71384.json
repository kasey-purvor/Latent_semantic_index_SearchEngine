DOI: 10.1017\/S0022226704212804\nf 2004 Cambridge University Press\nJoseph Aoun & Yen-hui Audrey Li, Essays on the representational and\nderivational nature of grammar: the diversity of wh-constructions (Linguistic\nInquiry Monograph 40). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003. Pp. xii+289.\nReviewed by KERSTIN HOGE, University of Oxford\nThis book explores two constructions which have been at the centre of\ntheoretical debate in recent syntactic literature, namely multiple wh-interrog-\natives (see e.g. Boeckx & Grohmann 2003) and relative clauses (see e.g.\nAlexiadou et al. 2000). This twofold concern is reflected in the book\u2019s\norganisation.Multiplewh-interrogatives are dealtwith in part I, \u2018Wh interrog-\natives : superiority and interpretation\u2019, which comprises chapters 1\u20133, while\nrelative constructions are addressed in part II, \u2018Relativization: derivation\nand structure\u2019, which covers chapters 4\u20137. The book further contains an\nintroduction and an appendix; the appendix thematically belongs with part\nI, in that it discusses superiority-related effects, viz. the rescuing effect of a\nthird wh-phrase and the so-called antisuperiority effect in Japanese.\nReaders will rightly expect not only to learn something new about\nboth multiple wh-interrogatives and relative clauses but also to find out what\nunifies these two syntactic constructions, and the book does not disappoint.\nAt the heart of part I lies Aoun & Li\u2019s (henceforth A&L) analysis of multiple\nwh-interrogatives in Lebanese Arabic (henceforth LA). The new data from\nLA are argued to necessitate a new approach to superiority effects, which\nrelies neither on Chomsky\u2019s (1995) Minimal Link Condition nor on an\nanalysis of superiority as a Weak Crossover effect (Hornstein 1995).\nThe problem posed by the LA data is that superiority effects, identifiable\nas such by the fact that ungrammaticality is obviated when the wh-phrase\nin situ is changed to a complex phrase of the form which NP, extend to\nnon-movement and non-crossing structures. It is thus possible for a multiple\nwh-interrogative to have one wh-phrase in situ and the other wh-phrase in\nthe specifier of Comp, with the latter being related to a resumptive pronoun\nin an island. As the absence of reconstruction effects shows, these interrog-\natives must involve base-generation of the higher wh-phrase in the specifier\nof Comp and thereby qualify as non-movement structures. Nevertheless,\nsuperiority effects obtain unless the resumptive pronoun c-commands the\nwh-phrase in situ. This is true even for interrogatives where no wh-in situ\nintervenes (linearly or hierarchically) between the wh-phrase in the specifier\nJ. Linguistics 40 (2004), 655\u2013706. f 2004 Cambridge University Press\nPrinted in the United Kingdom\n655\nof Comp and its resumptive pronoun. The relevant structures are sche-\nmatically represented in (1) (A&L\u2019s (30a, b), page 19, and (34a, c), page 21).\n(1) (a) [CP wh1 [IP \u2026 [island \u2026 RP1 \u2026 wh2 \u2026 ] \u2026 ]]\n(RP1 c-commands wh2)\n(b) *[CP wh2 [IP \u2026 [island \u2026 wh1 \u2026 RP2 \u2026 ] \u2026 ]]\n(RP2 does not c-command wh1)\n(c) *[CP wh1 [IP \u2026 [island \u2026 RP1 \u2026 ] \u2026 wh2 \u2026 ]]\n(RP1 does not c-command wh2)\n(d) *[CP wh1 [IP \u2026 [island \u2026 RP1 \u2026 ] \u2026 [island \u2026 wh2 \u2026 ] \u2026 ]]\n(RP1 does not c-command wh2)\nThe existence of superiority effects in LA non-movement and non-crossing\nstructures cannot be captured by the standard account of superiority, which\nviews superiority violations as the illicit movement of a wh-phrase across a\nc-commanding wh-phrase that is not in the same minimal domain. Similarly,\nthe LA superiority effects do not lend themselves to an explanation along\nthe lines of Hornstein (1995), where the functional interpretation of multiple\nwh-interrogatives paves the way for a reanalysis of superiority violations\nas Weak Crossover effects and thereby divorces superiority from movement.\nAs argued convincingly by A&L, pair-list interpretations of LA multiple\nquestions are not derivative of functional readings but are distinguished\nby different locality conditions, i.e. only multiple wh-interrogatives have a\ndomain requirement defined by Tense, so that a wh-phrase can only have\na pair-list interpretation with another wh-phrase within the same phase.\nWhat then emerges is a conception of superiority as a constraint, which\nprohibits the occurrence of a variable or resumptive pronoun related to\nthe wh-phrase in the specifier of Comp in a position where it does not\nc-command the second wh-phrase. A&L implement this idea by proposing\nto derive superiority from a minimality condition on chain formation, the\nso-called Minimal Match Condition (henceforth MMC), which states that\n\u2018an operator must form a chain with the closest XP it c-commands\nthat contains the same relevant features \u2019 (4). Crucially, chain formation is\nnot restricted to movement but can be a representational process, as in the\ncase of multiple wh-interrogatives with a resumptive pronoun in an island.\nOn the assumption that resumptive pronouns contain a wh-feature (33),\nthe MMC derives the contrasts observed in non-movement structures as\nfollows.\nIn a well-formed multiple wh-interrogative, e.g. (1a), the wh-operator in\nthe specifier of Comp forms a chain with the resumptive pronoun, since it\nis the pronoun which is the closest XP with a wh-feature c-commanded by\nthe operator. Superiority effects in crossing structures, e.g. (1b), involve the\nwh-operator forming a chain with the lower wh-phrase, which has the result\nthat the resumptive pronoun will share an index with the intervening\nwh-phrase and will, hence, be A-bound, in violation of Principle C of the\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n656\nBinding Theory. Superiority effects in non-crossing structures, e.g. (1c, d),\nare said to constitute violations of the Bijection Principle. Here, the\nwh-operator must form a chain with both the resumptive pronoun and\nthe lower wh-phrase, since the two are equidistant : neither c-commands the\nother.\nThe reliance on Binding Theory principles to rule out superiority vi-\nolations in crossing structures is reminiscent of Aoun, Hornstein, Lightfoot\n& Weinberg\u2019s (1987) Generalised Binding approach to superiority. The\nresemblance is compounded by the analysis proposed for the ameliorating\neffect of D(iscourse)-linked wh-phrases. If, as required by the MMC, all\nchains are constrained by minimality, the absence of superiority effects can\nno longer be related to the absence of movement. Instead, A&L revive the\nidea of Aoun et al. that the absence of superiority effects with wh-phrases of\nthe form which NP is due to the structural complexity of the wh-in situ. The\nlexical item which constitutes a D-head and thereby differs from mono-\nmorphemic wh-phrases, e.g. who, which are maximal projections in the\nspecifier of D. As a head, which does not qualify as a possible variable for\nthe wh-operator in the specifier of Comp. Hence, an intervening which-\nphrase does not prevent the wh-operator from forming a chain with a lower\nwh-element. In other words, it is not the D-linked nature of which-phrases\nthat accounts for the absence of superiority effects but the morphosyntactic\ndifference between which-phrases and monomorphemic wh-phrases.\nFurther support for A&L\u2019s analysis of which-phrases might come from\nthe fact that no cancellation of superiority effects is observed with a\nwh-phrase of the form how many NP, as illustrated in (2).\n(2) (a) Mary asked how many people read what.\n(b) *Mary asked what how many people read.\nExamples like (2b) were used by Pesetsky (1987) to argue that what is rel-\nevant for the cancellation of superiority effects is the semantic distinction\nbetween D-linked and non-D-linked wh-phrases, rather than the distinction\nbetween complex and monomorphemic wh-phrases. However, if which and\nhow differ in categorial status, i.e. which is a head whereas how is a phrase\nin the specifier of an articulated DP, A&L\u2019s MMC will neatly derive the\nrelevant contrast without having to invoke the notion of D-linking.\nWhile I am thus sympathetic to A&L\u2019s attempt to reduce the amelioration\nof superiority under D-linking to the morphosyntactic nature of which-\nphrases, it needs to be pointed out that the MMC, which applies to move-\nment and non-movement structures alike, leaves even less leeway than a\nmovement-based account of superiority for the explanation of cancelled\nsuperiority effects. And it is telling that the standard examples of multiple\nwh-interrogatives without superiority effects, i.e. (i) D-linked interrogatives\nwith non-which-phrases, (ii) interrogatives illustrating the rescuing effect of\nan additional wh-phrase, and (iii) German multiple wh-interrogatives, are\nR E V I E W S\n657\neither dismissed as non-standard wh-questions, in the case of (i), or left aside\nas unclear or not \u2018straightforward\u2019, in the case of (ii) and (iii). It is difficult\nto see how these phenomena could be captured, given the status of the MMC\nas a representational constraint, and a more wholehearted attempt to engage\nwith this question would have been welcome.\nAn important consequence of A&L\u2019s account of superiority is the need for\na theory which contains derivational and representational constraints \u2013 an\napproach which is likely to be rejected outright by some. The existence of\nboth derivational and representational constraints is justified on the basis\nthat in LA, ungrammatical wh-extraction from a wh-island contrasts with\nthe grammatical occurrence of a resumptive pronoun in a wh-island. While\nthe former violates the Minimal Link Condition, the latter, which involves\nbase-generation of the wh-operator, does not. If the grammar did not contain\nthe Minimal Link Condition in addition to the MMC, the ungrammaticality\nof the wh-island violation could not be derived. Thus, the empirical evidence\nprovided for distinguishing derivations and representations in the grammar\nrests on A&L\u2019s claim that true resumption, i.e. the occurrence of a resump-\ntive pronoun which is separated from its wh-phrase by an island, does not\ninvolve syntactic movement, and it is the use of reconstruction as a diag-\nnostic tool for movement that allows them to put forward this claim.\nReconstruction also figures large as a diagnostic tool in part II of the\nbook, where A&L consider the structure of relative constructions in English,\nLA, Chinese and Japanese, and propose that relative constructions do\nnot have a uniform derivation but \u2018can be derived differently both within a\nlanguage and crosslinguistically \u2019 (191). More specifically, relative construc-\ntions can differ along the following parameters : (i) they can involve an\nadjunction or a complementation structure, (ii) they can be derived by base-\ngeneration or by movement, (iii) if instantiating movement, they can be\nderived by operator movement or by Head raising (i.e. movement of the\nHead of the relative clause from a position within the relative clause to a left-\nperipheral position), and (iv) if instantiating Head raising, they can involve\neither DP-raising or NP-raising.\nEnglish realises these options in the following way. First, relative con-\nstructions can be seen to involve a complementation structure, i.e. not only\nmust a relative clause be projected as a DP (cf. (3a) below, A&L\u2019s (16a), page\n101), but there also exists a selection relation between D and CP (cf. (3b),\nA&L\u2019s (17c), page 102).\n(3) (a) He is an actor that wants to do everything and *(a) producer that\nwants to please everyone.\n(b) the four of the boys *(that came to dinner)\nSecondly, since English relative constructions clearly contain a gap,\nthey must be derived by movement. A&L now argue that English relative\nconstructions exemplify both Head raising and operator movement.\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n658\nNon-wh-relatives are claimed to involve Head raising, whereas wh-relatives,\nnon-wh-relatives with type II determiners (e.g. some) and adjunct relatives\nare said to instantiate operator movement. Empirical support for this claim\ncomes from the distribution of idiom chunks and from reconstruction effects\nin relative clauses containing anaphors and bound pronouns. Only where\nHead raising has applied to move the head from within the relative clause\nto its surface position will reconstruction be possible. Readers familiar with\nKayne\u2019s (1994) analysis of relative clauses will recognise the argument; what\nis new is A&L\u2019s claim that the data in (4) ((4a)=A&L\u2019s (2b) & (42b), page\n110; (4b)=(46a, c), page 111 ; (4c)=(52a), page 113) show a contrast between\nnon-wh- and wh-relatives.\n(4) (a) The headway that\/??which Mel made was impressive.\n(b) The picture of himselfi that\/*?which Johni painted in art class is\nimpressive.\n(c) The picture of his mother that\/?*which every student painted in art\nclass is impressive.\nHowever, as A&L themselves note in a footnote (244), not all speakers\nwill agree that there is such a clear-cut contrast between wh- and non-wh-\nrelatives with respect to reconstruction. In addition, the sentence in (5), in\nwhich the object of the matrix predicate make headway heads a relative\nclause, is problematic for the advocated view that the Head of a non-wh-\nrelative clause always originates within the relative clause, because it strongly\nsuggests that headway originates in the matrix clause with the rest of the\nidiom chunk.\n(5) John made the headway that got us out of here. (Bernstein 2001: 561).\nWhat ultimately ties together parts I and II is A&L\u2019s assertion that \u2018 the\nderivation of relative constructions parallels the derivation of wh-interrog-\natives \u2019 (219). That is to say, the choice as to which options of relative\nformation are realised by a particular language is determined by the\nmorphosyntactic properties of the phrases to be relativised, which are in turn\nreflected in the morphosyntactic structure of wh-phrases in wh-interrog-\natives. For example, English allows operator movement in wh-relatives, as\nin wh-interrogatives, because the Question, Quantification and Restriction\nparts of a wh-expression are generated as one unit. In contrast, Chinese\nallows operator movement only in adjunct relatives because non-adjunct\nChinese wh-expressions contain only the Restriction part. In English, where\nthe morphological composition of a wh-expression contains both Quantifi-\ncation and Restriction, NPs cannot occur in argument position and conse-\nquently Head raising cannot apply to move an NP to the left periphery of\na relative clause. This contrasts again with Chinese, where non-adjunct wh-\nexpressions contain only the Restriction, which indicates that Chinese will\nallow NPs to occur in argument position. Consequently, Chinese can make\nR E V I E W S\n659\nuse of Head raising of an NP in its relative constructions, with the result that\nreconstruction will be unavailable in cases involving a quantified NP.\nThis proposal allows A&L to recognise the close link that exists between\nwh-interrogatives and relative clauses in a framework in which relative\nclauses are not uniformly derived via wh-movement but can be generated by\nHead raising. If the world divides between splitters and lumpers, A&L do\ntheir best to provide a bridge between the two approaches when dissecting\nsyntactic phenomena which were formerly lumped together, without com-\npletely losing sight of the characteristics that unite them. Resumptive pro-\nnouns in bothwh-interrogatives and relativisation may fail to involve a unified\nstrategy, but A&L show that all resumptive pronouns, regardless of whether\nthey involve movement or base-generation, need to be distinguished from\nbound pronouns, and that all relativisation strategies ultimately find their\nexplanation in the morphosyntactic properties of the nominal expressions in\nthe language. It is this carefully balanced approach which, together with\nthe beautifully clear argumentation and the focus on data not previously\ndiscussed, highly commends this book to any reader interested in current\nsyntactic theory.\nREFERENCES\nAlexiadou, A., Law, P., Meinunger, A. & Wilder, C.

Pp. xii+289.\nReviewed by FERNANDA PRATAS, Universidade Nova de Lisboa\nThis book is quite an achievement, and a must for linguists working or\nplanning to work on Cape Verdean Creole (CVC), especially if a generative\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n660\nframework is adopted. Marlyse Baptista provides an extensive description of\nthe syntax of the language, defining her approach as follows: \u2018The primary\ntheoretical framework of generative grammar that I adopt in this book is\nthe Minimalist Program\u2019 (8).\nCape Verde is an African archipelago composed of two main clusters of\nislands, about 450 miles off the coast of Senegal. It was a Portuguese colony\nuntil 1975, and although CVC is the native language of all its inhabitants,\nPortuguese is still the only official language in the country. Baptista ident-\nifies the languages that have contributed to the formation of KRIOLU (as\nit is known by its native speakers) : \u2018besides Portuguese, which contributed\nto its lexicon, the African element is mostly represented by the Niger-\nKordofanian languages: West-Atlantic languages \u2026 and the Mande lan-\nguages \u2019 (19).\nThe fieldwork that supported the author\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation, completed\nat Harvard University in 1997, has been followed by three field trips to Cape\nVerde (in 1997, 2000 and 2001), to gather data representative of all four\nbasilectal Sotavento (leeward) varieties, which are spoken on the islands of\nBrava, Fogo, Santiago and Maio.\nThe volume aims at a threefold audience : creolists, generativists, and\nnative speakers of the language. Chapters 3\u20135 are essentially descriptive,\nwhereas chapters 7 and 8 are more theoretical and, according to the author,\n\u2018should be of particular interest to generativists \u2019 (5) ; chapter 6 \u2018serves as a\nbridge \u2019 (5) between the first and second parts. Thematically, the book offers\nan overview of NP and VP internal patterns (chapters 3 and 4), a description\nof word order patterns (chapter 5) and clause structure (chapter 6), and\nanalyses of verbal syntax (chapter 7) and the syntax of pronominals (chapter\n8). In chapters 1 and 2 we find, respectively, an introduction and a socio-\nhistorical sketch. In these chapters, the author outlines her goals and\northographic choices, as well as the historical and demographic circum-\nstances that surrounded the genesis of CVC.\nOne of the goals defined by Baptista is \u2018 to promote a better understand-\ning of CVC, a language that offers serious descriptive challenges \u2019 (4).\nSome of these challenges are provided by its complex pronominal system,\nwhich is described in the second section of chapter 3. We learn that\nCVC pronominals are \u2018not marked for case, number, or gender except for\nthe formal second person singular pronouns nho and nha \u2019 (46). The distri-\nbution of both the clitic and nonclitic paradigms is illustrated, as are com-\nbinations of clitics and nonclitics. With the sentence in (1), Baptista\nexemplifies one of the possible combinations. The sentence also includes a\npossessive form.\n(1) Kel rapas di meu, el, e more. (61)\nthat boy of mine NONCL CL died\n\u2018That boy of mine, he died. \u2019\nR E V I E W S\n661\nThe demonstrative kel is not a pronominal in this context, but a modifier of\nthe noun rapas \u2018boy\u2019. Although in this section Baptista only introduces\ndemonstratives in modifier positions (57\u201359), CVC also has true demon-\nstrative pronominals, like kel-la \u2018 that one\u2019 and kel-li \u2018 this one\u2019.\nAt several points in the book, the author takes into account relevant\ntheories concerning some widely-debated characteristics present in creole\ngrammars, adopting a comparative perspective and discussing whether\nthese apply to CVC or not. This is the case, for instance, with pluralization\nstrategies : \u2018This section proves particularly enlightening in the realm of\ninflectional morphology in creole languages and is significant with regard\nto the current debate on the morphological properties of creole languages\u2019\n(35). Baptista argues that in CVC \u2018plural suffixation on nominal stems is\na productive process\u2019 (36), against Holm\u2019s (1988) proposal that, as a rule,\ncreole nouns are not inflected for number. She notes that although \u2018CVC\nis endowed with a wide range of quantifiers rendering a plural interpretation\nto the nouns they modify, \u2026 the use of a quantifier does not preclude the\nnoun from carrying the plural suffix, particularly if the noun is animate \u2019 (37).\nThe example in (2) illustrates (TAM=TENSE, ASPECT, MOOD marker) :\n(2) Ta ten txeu mininus ki ta ba skola. (37)\nTAM have a.lot children COMP TAM go school\n\u2018There are a lot of children who go to school. \u2019\nThe descriptive goals of the book, as noted earlier, are generally met in\nchapters 3\u20135 (134 pages). The extensive list of phenomena under study\nincludes, among others, pluralization, gender marking, nominal redupli-\ncation, pronouns, adjectives, TAM markers, the copula, verbal reduplication,\npassivization, serial verb constructions, negation, quantifiers, double object\nconstructions, topicalization, clefting, and wh-questions. Chapter 6 (10\npages) briefly describes CVC TAM templates, illustrating the possible com-\nbinations of the markers ta, sta and -ba.\n(3) Joa\u02dco ta staba senpri ta kumeba. (166)\nJoa\u02dco TAM be+ANT always TAM eat+ANT\n\u2018Joa\u02dco was always eating. \u2019\nIn this chapter, Baptista also proposes that CVC is endowed with a biclausal\nstructure: there are two different AuxP projections, which could account for\nthe recurrence of some TAM markers, for instance, in the pattern sta-ba ta\nV-ba, and for the distribution of senpri \u2018always \u2019 between sta and ta, analysed\nas adjoined to the second AuxP in examples such as (3).\nIn spite of all these qualities, the book has some drawbacks. Besides\ndescription, the author\u2019s goal is \u2018 to use the tools provided by generative\nlinguistics to uncover scientific evidence for the principles that rule the\nlinguistic system of this particular language\u2019 (4). Chapters 7 and 8 (100 pages)\narrive at some conclusions which appear to me to be empirically and\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n662\ntheoretically problematic. Below I will address two such problems, namely\nthe author\u2019s claims that CVC has verb raising (verb movement to a position\nhigher than V) and referential null subjects.\nThe verb-raising and null-subject parameters have been extensively de-\nbated in the generative literature of the past decade. The positive settings\nfor these parameters have often been linked to rich verbal agreement mor-\nphology. In turn, this link has met with a fair amount of scepticism. In\nparticular, linguists have questioned what is meant by \u2018rich\u2019 morphology.\nIt is also well known that certain languages with little or no overt verbal\nagreement morphology still allow verb raising (for example, Kronoby\nSwedish and Troms\u00f8 Norwegian).\nOne type of data used to diagnose verb raising in SVO languages involves\nthe distribution of floating quantifiers. The traditional argument runs as\nfollows: consider a quantifier modifying a subject NP; whenever it appears\nto the right of the verb, it must have been left behind by the NP subject\nmoving to Spec,IP (where it receives nominative case) ; the quantifier is, then,\nstranded in Spec,VP (where the NP subject has been base-generated) and\nthe verb raises past it. The analysis proposed by Bobaljik (1995) shows,\nhowever, that quantifiers may not be a reliable diagnostic for tracing NP\nbase positions, since they can be analysed as adjuncts to the left of some XP.\nThis accounts for the following contrast in English:\n(4) (a) Larry, Darryl and Gerry came into the cafe\u00b4 *all.\n(b) Larry, Darryl and Gerry came into the cafe\u00b4 all [at the same time].\n(c) Larry, Darryl and Gerry came into the cafe\u00b4 all [very tired].\nFurthermore, the main data with floating quantifiers provided by Baptista as\nevidence for verb movement involves clauses with unaccusative verbs (like\ntxiga \u2018arrive\u2019) (196\u2013197) :\n(5) (a) Tudu konbidadu txiga na mismu tenpu.\nall guest arrive at same time\n\u2018All the guests arrived at the same time. \u2019\n(b) Konbidadu txiga tudu na mismu tenpu.\nguest arrive all at same time\n\u2018The guests arrived all at the same time. \u2019\nBaptista argues that the subject NP here is base-generated in Spec,VP\n(195) and that the tree representing the sentence in (5b) \u2018crucially shows\nthat the verb has moved to Ix (or to Tx), past the quantifier \u2019 (197). This\nanalysis is problematic in view of the fact that the English translation of the\nsentence in (5b) is not ill-formed. English does not have verb movement\nin the sense under discussion, and yet it exhibits quantifiers in postverbal\nposition. This could be accounted for by Bobaljik\u2019s (1995) analysis of quan-\ntifiers, as described above.\nR E V I E W S\n663\nIn either case, the subject of unaccusative verbs is widely assumed NOT to\nbe base-generated in Spec,VP, but rather as the internal argument of the\npredicate. In these constructions, whenever the NP moves to Spec,IP it may\nvery well leave the quantifier behind in its original postverbal position. And\nthe verb can stay in V. Hence, the prediction above is not applicable in this\ncase. Baptista fails to discuss the use of this diagnostic with, for instance,\ntransitive verbs; however, I have worked on this topic with my own in-\nformants from Santiago, who systematically reject the quantifier tudu \u2018all \u2019 to\nthe right of the verb.\nAnother criterion Baptista uses to diagnose verb raising is the placement\nof certain adverbs between the verb and its complement. Since the relevant\nadverbs are assumed to be left-adjoined to VP, it is concluded that verb\nraising is what allows these adverbs to appear to the right of the verb.\nHowever, some of Baptista\u2019s examples regarding adverb placement are taken\nfrom literary texts, like the following (187).\n(6) El ta benba pisadu di dinheru ki ta konpensaba\nhe ASP come loaded of money that ASP compensated\nmaterialmenti tenpu gastadu.\nmaterially time wasted\n\u2018He would show up loaded with money that would materially\ncompensate for wasted time. \u2019 (da Silva 1990: 28)\nIt is well known that, compared to spontaneous speech, literary texts are\nmore liable to violate grammatical rules. This suggests that literary texts\nare not the most reliable means for tapping into the grammatical com-\npetence of native speakers. Moreover, as discussed in DeGraff (in press),\nsometimes the creole speech produced by speakers who are bilingual in a\ncreole language and its lexifier (for instance, Haitian Creole and French,\nor Cape Verdean Creole and Portuguese) \u2013 as is the case with da\nSilva \u2013 may be influenced by some patterns that are grammatical in the\nlexifier, such as V-raising. As it turns out, similar examples of verb raising\nacross morphologically light adverbs (like ben \u2018 right \u2019) are rejected by my\nown informants from Santiago. Furthermore, these informants never use\nthe word ben ; instead they use dretu, always in final position. Compare\nthe following:\n(7) (a) Joa\u02dco prende ben se lison. (Baptista, page 185)\nJoa\u02dco learnt well his lesson\n(b) Joa\u02dco prende si lison dretu. (Pratas 2004)\nJoa\u02dco learnt his lesson well\nNevertheless, there may be some dialectal variation involved here. This is a\nsubject for future research. Baptista herself has previously shown some\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n664\nconcerns with sentences similar to the one in (7a), which she noted as being\nfrom her own dialect, and so they may not be \u2018representative \u2019 (DeGraff in\npress : note 66). This makes it more difficult to understand why the author\naffirms in this book so categorically that there is \u2018ample evidence \u2019 for verb\nmovement in CVC (200).\nStill on verb raising, she provides a comparison between the clausal\narchitecture of CVC and Guinea-Bissau Creole (GBC). She argues that\nin GBC \u2018there is no evidence for an independent TP, whereas there is\nin CVC\u2019 (204). This is associated with the fact that the TAM marker\n-ba \u2018 is a verbal inflection found exclusively bound to verb stems in CVC,\nwhereas ba is a non-inflectional (unbound) Tense marker in GBC found\nnot only after verbs, but also after nominal and adjectival predicates \u2019\n(201).\n(8) (a) Joa\u02dco ta staba ta kumeba. (CVC) (199)\nJoa\u02dco TAM be+ANT TAM eat+ANT\n\u2018Joa\u02dco would have been eating. \u2019\n(b) I kumpra pon ba. (GBC) (201)\ns\/he buy bread [+PAST]\n\u2018S\/he had bought bread. \u2019\nFollowing Bobaljik & Thra\u00b4insson (1998) on the relation between a Split IP\nand verb raising, Baptista proposes that this difference between these two\nCreole languages \u2018predicts that there should be a difference in V-movement\nbetween CVC and GBC, and we have shown that this difference does exist \u2019\n(209).\nHer strongest argument for verb raising in CVC comes, in fact, from a\nconsideration of the TAM imperfective marker -ba. Baptista proposes\nthat verb movement to T allows this morpheme to affix to the right of the\nstem. In a language like English, however, we find the TAM suffix -ed.\nIn his dissertation, Bobaljik (1995) outlines a Distributed Morphology\nanalysis for English -ed suffixation, explaining it by means of lowering,\na post-syntactic operation, in the morphological component of the gram-\nmar, and Costa & Pratas (2003) propose that the lowering of Tense is also\nwhat accounts for -ba suffixation in CVC.\nIn chapter 8, Baptista argues that CVC is a pro-drop language. Expletive\nnull subjects in this language (with \u2018weather\u2019 verbs or raising constructions,\nfor instance) are a widely attested phenomenon. Nevertheless, there is on-\ngoing controversy on whether the existence of null expletive subjects is, by\nitself, sufficient evidence to classify a language as pro-drop. Moreover, the\nauthor assumes that CVC also has null referential subjects, and this as-\nsumption, in my opinion, still remains to be supported by a more convincing\ndata analysis. Null referential (argument) subjects are categorically ruled out\nin most CVC sentences, even in embedded clauses, where their semantic\nR E V I E W S\n665\ncontent could be easily recovered from the context. Baptista\u2019s claim that\nCVC allows null referential subjects finds only potential support in sentences\nlike (9).\n(9) (El\/E) e nha pai. (255)\nPRON.3SG\/CL.3SG is my father\n\u2018It\u2019s my father.\/He is my father. \u2019\nIn all other contexts (i.e. except for 3sg+present tense copula) referential pro\nis impossible. Hence, it is not clear how it would be licensed here. In Pratas\n(2004), I argue that there is no pro in (9) but some kind of haplology: the\n3sg clitic and the copula, both e, coalesce phonologically as a single e. There\nis also another possibility: the pro in (9) is not referential, but expletive. If\na sentence like It\u2019s my father, with an overt expletive subject, is possible\nin English, it might be possible with an expletive pro in CVC. I have not\nfound empirical evidence for the claim \u2018that CVC is a radical pro-drop\nlanguage\u2019 (266).\nDespite the problematic cases noted above, Baptista\u2019s theoretical\nproposals come along with a careful review of the literature on both verb-\nraising and pro-drop. Furthermore, theoretical proposals become secondary\nwhen such an extensive set of new data is provided, especially in the case\nof a language that has received far too little study from a generative per-\nspective.\nPersonally, I am truly grateful to the author, for this book has been a\nsource of inspiration for my own work, in generative linguistics in general\nand on CVC in particular.\nREFERENCES\nBobaljik, J.

Pp. x+130.\nReviewed by MATTHEW ABSALOM, University of South Australia\nThe external sandhi phenomenon of RADDOPPIAMENTO SINTATTICO (RS here-\nafter) is one of the touchstones of contemporary phonological theory and\nhas featured in descriptive linguistic texts in Italy since the 15th century.\nGiven this pedigree, any new work on the topic must necessarily bring new\ninsights or, at the very least, clarify what we already know about RS. Un-\nfortunately, the volume under review fulfils neither of these expectations.\nThis OUTSTANDING DISSERTATION, a printed version of Borrelli\u2019s Ph.D. thesis,\nsuffers from two major flaws: gross inaccuracies in content and scholarship,\nmade worse by sloppy presentation.1\nA disconcerting aspect of the volume relates to the outdated and limited\nnature of references contained in the bibliography. There is little reference\nto the important research on RS published outside the U.S.A., and the bulk\nof works referred to are from the 1980s and early 1990s. The median publi-\ncation year of the references relating specifically to the topic of RS (around\n25 out of 91) is 1985.\nThe book opens with a contextualising chapter entitled \u2018Introduction\nand prosodic preliminaries \u2019, which begins by noting that \u2018raddoppiamento\nsintattico, or sometimes raddoppiamento fonosintattico, has received a vast\namount of attention in recent years \u2019 and that it has been \u2018 [l]ong rec-\nognized in Italian grammar books\u2019 (3). The author at this point does not\nprovide one single reference to support her claim, as if this vast literature is\nin fact a fiction. This pattern of unsubstantiated claims, which continues\nthroughout the volume, entirely compromises the scholarly integrity of the\nstudy.\nBorrelli describes the environments for RS and makes the valid point that\nmany studies dedicated to RS focus exclusively on stress-conditioned RS.\nShe discusses the relationship between Standard Italian and the dialects,\ndescribing the traditional tripartite division of dialects based on the geo-\ngraphical designations North, Centre and South. The author claims that her\nstudy \u2018offers a comprehensive and unified account of RS incorporating both\nenvironments in which it occurs \u2026 [T]he resulting analysis, while uniting\ndiachronic and synchronic aspects, will thus account for general patterns\n[1] This review has greatly benefited from the input of my colleagues Mary Stevens and John\nHajek, whom I warmly acknowledge.\nR E V I E W S\n667\nthroughout Italy \u2019 (5). This is an ambitious agenda which would appear\nbeyond the scope of a volume of little more than 130 pages.\nThe description of RS presented by Borrelli accords with the conventional\npresentation found in much American literature on RS. Basically, RS is\nconceptualised as initial-consonant gemination deriving from two processes:\nphonological RS, which is productive and occurs after any word ending in\na final-stressed vowel ; and lexical RS, which is restricted to a small, defined\nset of words. Disappointingly, we are once again offered a limited, idealised\ndescription of RS despite the existence of published research which demon-\nstrates that RS is in fact empirically much more complex. By 1911, it had\nalready been noted by the well-known Italian scholar, Amerindo Camilli\n(whose numerous works on RS are absent from Borrelli\u2019s reference list), that\nin the classic RS environment there are a number of possible phonetic out-\ncomes, not simply initial-consonant doubling (see Absalom, Stevens & Hajek\n2002 for references). More recently, other scholars, none of whom appear\nin Borrelli\u2019s limited bibliography, have reiterated this point (Bertinetto 1985;\nAgostiniani 1992; Absalom & Hajek 1997). As well as initial-consonant\ngemination, it is possible that RS will be blocked by pausing, final-vowel\nlengthening or sudden pitch movement. Additionally, the insertion of a\nglottal stop between the RS trigger and the following consonant can inhibit\nRS (see Absalom, Stevens & Hajek 2002 for a summary). These facts must be\nincluded in any quality study on RS.\nFollowing this introductory section, Borrelli turns to \u2018Prosodic pre-\nliminaries \u2019. She describes Italian syllable structure and highlights traits of\nindividual consonant groups. The second major fault in the work emerges\nin this section: factual inaccuracies accompanied by careless scholarship.\nBorrelli maintains that \u2018 [t]he affricates [ts, dz] are always long as are the\npalatalized consonants [N, y, S ] \u2019 (6). To demonstrate this point, Borrelli\nprovides statistics on consonant length taken from a 1970s phonetic study. In\nfact, however, the claim regarding length is incorrect, or rather, incomplete.\nNumerous studies show that the five consonants listed are long INTER-\nVOCALICALLY, whether word-medially or across word boundaries (Serianni\n1989: 19) ; by contrast, post-consonantally, post-pausally or in absolute\ninitial position, these consonants are not phonologically long. Instead of\nclarifying this situation, the decontextualised presentation of length statistics\nonly confuses the issue. Borrelli provides the following data: \u2018 [S] is 67%\nlonger than [f] and 54% longer than [s] ; [N] and [y] are two to three times\nlonger than [m], [n], [l] and [\u00b6] \u2019 (6). The reader does not know the environ-\nment of these length differences, why the consonants listed were compared\nor, indeed, the significance of the results. This type of careless scholarship\nis singularly unhelpful.\nTurning to vowels, Borrelli states that \u2018 [t]he most common environment\nof long vowels is in open stressed syllables \u2019 (6). This statement begs the\nquestion, where else do they occur? Her explication only leads to more\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n668\nconfusion. She continues that long vowels \u2018can also occur when the mor-\nphology causes a suffix, which happens to be a vowel, to join onto an\nidentical vowel \u2019 (6). This appears straightforward until we read the ensuing\ncontradiction that \u2018 in such cases each vowel tends to be pronounced\nseparately to the point of forming distinct syllables, rather than joining to\nform a long vowel \u2019 (6). Borrelli is clearly unaware of the existence of\nan extensive study of long vowels published by Valesio (1967), over three\ndecades ago.\nBorrelli states categorically that \u2018 [t]he language [Italian] does not allow\nfor extra-long syllables \u2019 (7). This claim demonstrates a further compounding\ndeficiency of this study: lack of familiarity with recent developments in\nItalian phonology. Hajek (2000) has recently questioned the conventionally\naccepted two-way length distinction in Italian, proposing the possibility of\nternary vowel length contrasts, which can be supported empirically.\nThe third section of this introductory chapter is dedicated to a discussion\nof stress and vowel length in diachrony. Borrelli describes penultimate stress\nas most common, with the possibility of lexical stress falling on the ante-\npenultimate and ultimate syllables. To illustrate this claim, Borrelli provides\nus with a highly suspicious example of scholarship. She presents a \u2018survey of\none-hundred and twenty consecutive words in a dictionary\u2019 (8) and from this\ndeduces the following distribution of stress patterns:\npenultimate 76.67%\nantepenultimate 20.83%\nfinal 2.50%\npre-antepenultimate 0%\nBorrelli fails to provide details of the source, but given that the words cited\ninclude citta` and tavola, one must wonder what sort of dictionary has a list of\n120 consecutive words which span the alphabet in this way.\nThe discussion of stress in Italian is unsatisfying since, after presenting\nvarious positions, Borrelli simply states that the issue is \u2018by no means closed\u2019\nand that \u2018the present study follows the traditional approach\u2019 (14). As in-\ndicated at the opening of this review, the volume does nothing to clarify our\nunderstanding in this respect.\nDisappointingly, chapters 2\u20135 are also riddled with inaccurate infor-\nmation, unsubstantiated claims and a clear lack of knowledge of published\nliterature in the field. Chapter 2, \u2018Historical gemination\u2019, attempts to trace\nthe diachronic development of gemination via assimilation from Latin\nto Italian. In this chapter, Borrelli presents a range of data showing recon-\nstructed developments of gemination. This reviewer finds it incredibly\nproblematic that there is at times no reference to the sources of data cited.\nPhonetic transcriptions provided by the author are erroneous. Borrelli\ntranscribes foglia as [fcyia] (17, (26a)) when it should appear as either [fcyya]\nor [fcy:a], depending on the view of geminate consonants taken. Ironically,\nR E V I E W S\n669\nBorrelli\u2019s own transcription conflicts with her earlier mistaken claim that [y]\nis always long.\nChapter 3, \u2018Raddoppiamento sintattico : data\u2019 purports to provide \u2018a\ncareful examination of RS in the many dialects of Italy\u2019 (25) ; in a chapter\nwhich numbers eleven pages, this claim is clearly disproportionate. The first\nsection deals with RS in Standard Italian and in the Centre dialects. Borrelli\nlists the terms which apparently trigger RS in these varieties. Again, there\nis at times no reference to the source of these data and the descriptions\nprovided are inaccurate. For instance, Borrelli\u2019s agglomeration of \u2018Tuscan\nvarieties (including those of Florence, Lucca, and Pisa) \u2019 (28) demonstrates\na profound ignorance both of the linguistic varieties of Tuscany and of\npublished descriptions of these varieties. She states that these varieties\nexhibit RS after the \u2018masculine plural article i \u2019 (28). RS is found exception-\nally after the masculine plural article in Lucca, whereas in Florence and Pisa\nthis is not the case (Agostiniani 1992). Inaccuracies of this degree undermine\nany notion of a \u2018careful examination\u2019.\nBorrelli\u2019s section on \u2018Northern dialects \u2019 highlights a problem of coherence\nwithin the work. In the opening chapter, we are told that Tuscany, Umbria\nand the Marches are central regions of Italy. In this chapter, however,\nBorrelli classes the dialects of \u2018northern and eastern Tuscany, northern\nUmbria, and the central Marches \u2019 as Northern dialects. This incoherence\nserves as a further illustration of the inaccurate treatment of information.\nTurning to the South, section 3.3, the provenance of data presented will\nbe unclear to most readers. It is clear to this reviewer, however, that whole\nswathes of argumentation presented by Borrelli have been sourced from\nother publications which are not adequately acknowledged.\nIn chapter 4, Borrelli offers a review of previous analyses of RS. Essen-\ntially, this chapter is a retelling which does not add to or extend our knowl-\nedge of RS. It is perhaps useful as a type of outdated literature review. What\nis of greatest concern to this reviewer is Borrelli\u2019s lack of coverage of seminal\nliterature.\nChapter 5, \u2018Lenition\u2019, presents cross-dialectal patterns of lenition, which\nare relevant because of the interaction between lenition and RS. The chapter\ndescribes lenition first in Standard Italian, then in the three large geographi-\ncal blocks of the Centre, North and South. The paucity of examples provided\nis problematic ; for instance, in the section on Northern dialects, Borrelli only\nprovides examples from Milanese and from this she infers that \u2018there is little\nif any productive lenition \u2026 in this dialect group\u2019 (63f.). This is a large claim\nbased on a corpus of just ten words. Another problem with the examples\nprovided is that, at times, they do not appear to be from the source given.\nThis is the case in her example (109), where Borrelli provides examples of\nthe Tuscan gorgia toscana ; while her examples (a\u2013d) are found in the\ncited source, example (e) is not. Additionally, the phonetic transcription of\nthis example is questionable, given that the high rounded back vowel is more\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n670\nlikely a semi-consonant : [hwesta]. All examples presented in (110) are absent\nfrom the cited source, and one of these even appears ungrammatical or, at\nleast, poetic. Ironically, once again, in (113e), the palatal glide is transcribed\nas a singleton ([i#honsiyeri#van:o#a#k:onsiyarsi] i consiglieri vanno a con-\nsigliarsi, \u2018 the advisers go to seek advice\u2019) in conflict with Borrelli\u2019s own\nstatement regarding its inherent length. While these may seem small things,\ntaken in the context of the range and frequency of inaccuracies occurring in\neach chapter, the value of this volume must be questioned.\nThe sixth and final chapter, \u2018Analysis \u2019, offers an optimality-theoretic (OT)\ntreatment of RS. The opening paragraph of this chapter (71) establishes a\nneat research agenda, but unfortunately, this analysis does not deliver. The\naccount provided is an unmotivated mish-mash of previous work with little\nrecognition of the relevant literature. Borrelli concludes the chapter leaving\na number of issues unresolved, including:\n. Why vowels are long in word-internal open syllables but not at word\nboundaries.\n. Why oxytones favour RS, that is consonant lengthening and not vowel\nlengthening.\n. Proparoxytones remain unexplained.\n. Loanword phonology cannot be dealt with.\nAgain, the volume fails to extend our knowledge of RS or Italian phonology.\nFurthermore, while purporting to offer a new, integrated analysis, Borrelli\nrelies on dubious past formulations to explain so-called lexical RS: \u2018as in\nprevious analyses, the lexical triggers of RS are stipulated to have in their\nunderlying representation an extra mora\u2019 (76). She also refers to syntactic\nconditioning as valid, once again demonstrating no clear awareness that\nthis has been roundly criticised as having no basis in the literature for RS\nin Italian, Roman and Tuscan varieties (see Bertinetto 1985; Agostiniani\n1992; Absalom & Hajek 1997; Loporcaro 1997) \u2013 even, most notably, by one\nof its former proponents, Vogel (1997: 66).\nA further comment regarding OT analyses of RS: Absalom & Hajek\n(1997) is the only attempt at an OT analysis, albeit preliminary, of ALL of\nthe phonetic resolutions which occur in the RS environment. While this\nwork has been available on the Internet since the mid-1990s, it and other\ncontemporary optimality-theoretic treatments of RS (see Absalom, Stevens\n& Hajek 2002 for full references) are not cited by Borrelli.\nTwo supplementary points must be added. First, Borrelli employs a range\nof terminology without appropriately clarifying its meaning. Among the\nterms used are \u2018minimal phrase \u2019 and \u2018phonological word\u2019, both of which\nhave contested meanings in the literature on phonological theory. There is\nan appeal to a sonority hierarchy (18) but it is unclear where this sonority\nhierarchy comes from, whether it is acoustic or perceptual, etc.\nR E V I E W S\n671\nSecond, an issue which I have referred to repeatedly above relates to the\nlack of familiarity with important research on the topic. Research at doctoral\nlevel should be of a rigorous nature, which, in my view, implies recognition\nof the full gamut of publications available on the given topic, whether from\nthe American tradition or not. The bibliographical shortcomings in this\nvolume could have been redressed by examining more closely the bibli-\nography in Lopocaro\u2019s (1997) meticulous discussion of RS, a work included\nas one of Borrelli\u2019s references.\nFinally, on the issue of presentation, there is a high degree of inconsistency\nin the format of in-text citations. To give but one example, on one page (61)\nBorrelli refers to (Rohlfs), (Rohlfs, \u00b7150) and (Rohlfs 1969, \u00b7151). There are\nmany occurrences of an author\u2019s name alone in brackets as the only reference\nto the source. This degree of incoherence would be unacceptable in under-\ngraduate work, not to mention in an OUTSTANDING DISSERTATION.\nTo conclude, this volume is riddled with slapdash scholarship, unsustained\nclaims and irregular presentation of data and citations. This is compounded\nby deficiencies in the treatment of data based on an overly limited bibli-\nography. The most unfortunate outcome of its publication in a prestigious\nseries such as \u2018Outstanding Dissertations in Linguistics \u2019 resides in the fact\nthat the partial and imbalanced view of RS presented will continue to be\naccepted as conventional by readers who do not have sufficient grounding\nin Italian linguistics. This type of study does nothing to further our under-\nstanding of complex phonological phenomena such as RS. In fact, in its\nrigid and reductionist framework, based on the search for the most neat and\nelegant theoretical formulation, it denies us all the messy complexity of real\nlinguistic behaviour which, arguably, lies at the heart of our passion for\nlanguage and linguistics.\nREFERENCES\nAbsalom, M. & Hajek, J.

Pp. xii+458.\nReviewed by ANDREW SIMPSON, SOAS\nOne of the primary stated aims of this investigation of DP-internal syntax\nis \u2018 to provide as comprehensive as possible a description of the phenomena\nsurrounding adjectival modification in French, and to use this as a basis to\nunderstand variation found in other languages\u2019 (1). The study focuses in\nparticular on the potential role of the category Number in the patterning\nof adjectives and other elements within DPs, and in doing so pursues the\ngeneral goal of describing syntactic variation solely in terms of interface\nproperties which can be justified by language-independent processes of\ncognition. Suggesting that both movement and the hypothesis of a fixed,\nuniversal hierarchy of functional projections are not justified by properties\nof the Conceptual-Intentional system, Adjectives, number and interfaces\n(henceforth ANI) makes an ambitious attempt to develop an analysis of\nvariation in DP-structure without assuming either movement or an elaborate\npre-established internal structure of DP constituents. This approach is re-\nferred to as \u2018Adaptive grammar\u2019 : \u2018we must shift from a Generative grammar\nthat searches among formal systems to an Adaptive grammar that searches\namong logically anterior properties [for] the effects they may have on a\nlanguage system\u2019 (324).\nFollowing its general introduction, ANI has four main chapters, each\ndealing with some aspect of the internal syntax of DPs (most frequently in\nFrench and English), and a long, final chapter on the potential advantages\nof Adaptive grammar over recent movement-based Principles and Par-\nameters models, with fairly extensive criticism of the latter. As the core ideas\nof ANI are essentially developed in chapters 2 and 3 of the book, I have\ndecided to concentrate on this part of ANI in the present review, though\nR E V I E W S\n673\nmention of the interesting extensions of the main approach to other patterns,\nin chapters 4 and 5, will also be briefly made.\nThe principal descriptive problem which chapter 2 of ANI sets out to\nconfront is the observation that certain adjectives frequently precede the\nnoun in French DPs, whereas other adjectives commonly follow it. In a\nnumber of recent analyses this is attributed to raising of the noun to a mid-\nlevel functional head position in the DP. ANI, however, sets out to develop\nan alternative account, based on differences in the way that pre- and post-\nnominal adjectives are interpreted relative to the noun. The starting point of\nthe analysis is the assumption that arguments and modifiers (\u2018dependents \u2019)\nregularly combine with other \u2018 functor \u2019 elements in a particular linear order\nin each language due to the parametric setting of a LINEARIZATION PARAMETER\n\u2018The functor precedes\/follows its dependent\u2019. In French, a head-initial\nlanguage, it is stated that the functor category precedes its dependent, and\nthat the ordering of an adjective following a noun is a reflection of this\nbasic linearization convention, the N being the functor and the adjective\nits dependent. Such an ordering of adjectives with the N also instantiates\none very basic way in which adjectives can semantically combine with\nnouns, the functor N being modified AS A SEMANTIC WHOLE by the dependent\nadjective. ANI then goes on to suggest that there is also a second way that\nadjectives may semantically combine with nouns \u2013 via the modification of a\nparticular semantic sub-property of a noun. It is proposed that the meaning\nof nouns commonly consists in a characteristic function f, a time interval i, a\npossible world w, and a variable assignment function g, and that adjectives\nwith an appropriate semantics may optionally modify just one (or more) of\nthese sub-properties\/functions in an N. For example, it is suggested that a\ntemporal adjective such as \u2018future\u2019 is able to modify the interval of time i in\nan N, the Adj \u2018perfect \u2019 may semantically combine with the characteristic\nfunction f, \u2018 false \u2019 can optionally modify the possible world function w, and\n\u2018alleged\u2019 can apply its force to the value assignment function g. Critically,\nthe LINEAR ordering of nouns and adjectives is argued to play a role in dis-\ntinguishing the different ways in which an adjective may be combined with a\nnoun. If an adjective modifies the entire network of sub-functions of an N\nand combines with the N as a semantic whole, it is suggested that this default\nmode of modification is regulated by the Linearization parameter, and in\nFrench the adjective dependent will follow the noun functor, resulting in N\nAdj sequences. Where an adjective is intended to modify only a certain sub-\nfunction of an N, ANI suggests that it may NOT follow the N, as such a\nsequencing would signal the regular intersective whole-to-whole modifi-\ncation of an N by an Adj. Rather, in order to encode modification of a sub-\npart of an N, an \u2018Elsewhere\u2019 application of the Linearization Parameter\nforces adjectives to be positioned in a different way, preceding the N. This\nconsequently results in sequences such as le futur pre\u00b4sident \u2018 the future\npresident \u2019, ce presume\u00b4 communiste \u2018 that alleged communist \u2019 and de parfaits\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n674\nscelerats \u2018perfect scoundrels \u2019, where the adjectives have intensional rather\nthan extensional readings. In such a view, interestingly, all adjectives are\nclaimed to be intersective, with adjectives traditionally taken to be subsective\nbeing analysed as attributing a property to just a subpart of the nouns they\nmodify.\nFollowing the initial presentation of this novel approach to adjectival\nmodification, the bulk of chapter 2 is then devoted to expanding on, and\nsupporting, such ideas with a substantial amount of evidence and argumen-\ntation. It is noted that certain adjectives may allow for a use in either pre- or\npost-nominal position (e.g. les nombreuses familles\/les familles nombreuses\n\u2018 the large\/numerous families \u2019, un habile chirurgien\/un chirurgien habile\n\u2018a skilful surgeon\u2019), and that though the difference in their interpretation\nin the two positions is sometimes subtle and difficult to assess in isolation,\nonce context and the use of factors such as negation and interrogation are\nemployed, a clear difference in meaning is perceivable, which is fully in line\nwith the characterization of pre- and post-nominal modification suggested\nin the chapter. The wealth of data and careful discussion provided here is\nenlightening, fresh, and generally very convincing. The chapter also shows\nhow a range of other patterns associated with adjectival modification (such\nas the placement of transitive participles) will naturally follow from the\naccount of pre-\/post-N modification developed in the chapter.\nHaving provided extensive support for its account of adjectival placement\nin French in chapter 2, chapter 3 of ANI then attempts to see how this\nmay be adapted to capture the facts of adjectival modification in languages\nwith rather different patterns, such as English. As English is a head-initial\nlanguage, ANI anticipates that adjectives which modify the whole of an N\nshould follow the noun, as in French, and that adjectives modifying a sub-\npart of N should precede it. However, modification in both such ways results\nin the positioning of adjectives before N in English, as for instance in the\nambiguous sequence my old friend (where \u2018old\u2019 would be positioned pre-\nceding the N in French if meaning \u2018former\u2019 and following the N if meaning\n\u2018aged\u2019). The explanation for the French\/English difference here, ANI\nsuggests, is due to the different ways that number is encoded in DPs in the\ntwo languages, as outlined below.\nQuite generally, it is first argued that languages require some means to\nindividualize or \u2018atomize\u2019 the sets defined by common nouns so that such\nNs can be used to refer to individual entities, and that atomization may\npotentially be effected by adding the features of number to a DP (or alterna-\ntively via the use of classifiers in other languages). It is further suggested that\nnumber may critically be grammaticalized in different DP-internal positions\nin different languages. In French, for example, it is argued that number is\nprimarily represented on determiners\/in D due to the regular singular\/plural\ncontrasts which are audibly present in determiners, whereas in English, it\nis suggested that number is primarily encoded in singular\/plural distinctions\nR E V I E W S\n675\non nouns\/in N. (Where any additional \u2018secondary\u2019 representation of number\nis attested, such as in demonstratives, this is described as \u2018agreement\u2019 rather\nthan the primary semantic encoding of number.) Later, in chapters 4 and 5,\nsuch differences in the location of number are argued to have clear conse-\nquences for the omission of DP-internal material. French, with number\nencoded on D, allows for the frequent omission of N, as it is D+Num which\ncritically atomizes the DP, whereas English, with number on N, permits\nN-omission much less easily, and contrasts such as the following are found:\nle gros_ \/the big *(one) ; la rouille\u00b4e_ \/the rusted *(one). Conversely, it is found\nthat D\/determiners can be more readily omitted in English than in French,\nas D does not have the important atomizing function in English that it does\nin French; this difference results in contrasts such as: Beavers build dams\neverywhere\/I hate beavers and *(Les) castors construisent des barrages.\/Je\ndeteste *(les) castors.\nThis hypothesized distinction between French and English in the encoding\nof number is then made use of in the following way. First, the assumption\nis made that regular adjectival modification requires the combination of an\nadjective with a noun BEFORE the latter undergoes atomization by the appli-\ncation of number. Second, ANI adopts a proposal made in Williams (1981)\nthat a word-final morphological head only has scope over elements to its left.\nIf number occurs as a suffix on N, as in English, this will have the effect that\nit can only have scope over adjectives to its immediate left. As a result, all\nregular adjectival modification will be forced to occur in positions to the\nleft of N in English, whether it modifies a subpart of N or N as an undiffer-\nentiated whole (and to compensate for the lack of positional freedom, it is\nsuggested that intonation\/stress is employed to encode differences in the way\nthat an adjective modifies an N). In contrast, French, with number encoded\nhigher in the DP, will allow for adjectives to occur either side of N, as pos-\nitioning adjectives to the right of N will NOT locate such elements outside of\nthe scope of any atomizing number on N as in English. The linear position-\ning of adjectives in French is therefore suggested to be solely dictated by the\nLinearization Principle. (As Bouchard notes, there is, however, a technical\ndifficulty present here, as number suffixed to a determiner in D in French\nmight not be expected to be able to take adjectives occurring to its right in\nits scope. This is a little concerning, as Williams\u2019 scopal rule is actually a key\ncomponent of the analysis put forward here.)\nWith its reference to the different primary location of number in the DP,\nANI thus develops an integrated characterization of variation in adjectival\nplacement, variation in the potential omission of Ns and Ds, as well as a\nplatform to describe various other phenomena, such as the occurrence of\nclitics in a language (further instances of the omission of N). ANI also\nestablishes a potential set of diagnostics for probing the phenomena of\nadjectival modification further in a wider array of languages. These aspects\nof ANI, along with a careful gathering of information about a wide range\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n676\nof adjectival patterns, and a fine description of the interpretations present in\nadjectival modification, are all positive qualities of the book, and make it a\nvery valuable and stimulating volume to read.\nOn a slightly more critical note, there are a number of issues relating to\nthe central analysis of the book which I feel require further examination.\nFirst of all, although there is in-depth treatment of French and English, and\nsome further mention of Walloon, Italian and Celtic, I believe it would have\nbeen more convincing if the book had attempted to test the predictions\nit makes against a wider array of typologically different languages. This\nshould not be difficult to do and might serve to add important support for\nthe number-based theory of adjectival placement. Secondly, ANI assumes\nthat adjectives will participate in the same kind of linearization with respect\nto a head which complements show (hence the term \u2018dependents \u2019 in the\nLinearization Principle refers to both modifiers and complements). This is\nnot a standard assumption, and data from a large-scale study (of over\n600 languages) in Dryer (1992) appears to confirm that the positioning of\nadjectives relative to nouns is not normally predictable from the regular\nhead\/complement ordering in a language. It could of course turn out that\nthe occurrence of number on Ns constrains the positioning of adjectives to\nbe pre-nominal in many head-initial languages in the way it does in English\n(hence giving the appearance of random variation in Dryer\u2019s data). How-\never, until such evidence is gathered, it might seem that adjectival positioning\nrelative to N does not so obviously follow the direction of complement\nselection. Finally, a word can be said about the general aim of the volume,\nnamely to describe linguistic phenomena solely by means of mechanisms\nwhich can be justified as legitimate interface conditions with logically\nanterior properties (hence disqualifying movement as a legitimate linguistic\nmechanism). Though it is clear that Number will indeed qualify as a legit-\nimate interface factor, the same cannot be said about another important\ncomponent of the analysis developed in the book \u2013 Williams\u2019 suggestion that\na word-final morphological head only has scope over elements to its left.\nUnless it is explained and motivated further (which it is not in ANI), this\nformal (and crucial) condition seems to be one which is quite the opposite\nfrom an interface condition with logically anterior properties. In order to\nconvince one fully that ANI\u2019s analysis of adjectival placement really is free\nof all formal \u2018 imperfections\u2019 and is driven by properties of the interfaces\nalone, it would therefore have been helpful if the full range of factors\naffecting word order variation were more transparently described in terms\nof properties of the interface.\nNotwithstanding such potential criticisms, it can be said that Adjectives,\nnumber and interfaces is definitely to be recommended, and is an extremely\nuseful and original work, which should be of interest to both new and ex-\nperienced researchers interested in the area of DP syntax and issues relating\nto the legitimacy of general syntactic formalisms.\nR E V I E W S\n677\nREFERENCES\nDryer, Matthew (1992).

Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic\nPublishers, 2002. Pp. v+378.\nReviewed by OLAF KOENEMAN, Groningen University\nThe behaviour of verbal arguments in clausal syntax has been a well-\nstudied topic since the beginning of the generative enterprise, and it\nempirically dominated the initial stages of the Minimalist program\n(Chomsky 1995). Subjects and objects are so central to syntax that every\nnew framework will, at the very least, have to make explicit statements\nabout their distribution. Despite this thorough attention, most scholars will\nagree that we have yet to finish answering even the core questions. Take\nthe observation that clauses generally seem to require subjects, whereas the\nsame is not true for objects. Mainstream generative frameworks have tried\nto cope with this fact by stating that some subject position (usually the\nspecifier of I(NFL)P or T(ENSE)P) has to be filled and that some abstract\ncase or \u2018EPP-feature \u2019 on the head of that projection triggers the presence of\na nominal phrase. Now, EPP stands for \u2018extended projection principle \u2019,\nthe old rule stating that every clause must have a subject. Hence, it is easy\nto see that such analyses hardly do more than give a technical description\nof the facts, providing no real insight. With respect to language variation,\ntake the fact that some but not all languages display short movement of\narguments across VP-adverbs, scrambling and\/or object shift. There is still\na lively debate about the nature of these movements and about what\ndetermines their presence or absence in a language (see, among many\nothers, Zwart 1997; Neeleman & Weerman 1999 and van Gelderen 2003 for\ndiffering views).\nIn this monograph, Eric Haeberli proposes a new theory to account for\nthe distribution of arguments. The book roughly consists of two parts. In\npart one, the first two chapters, Haeberli sketches the relevant issues, makes\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n678\nhis theoretical assumptions explicit (in short, Chomsky\u2019s (1995) minimalism:\nyes; Kayne\u2019s (1994) anti-symmetry: no) and sets out to formulate a\nframework that captures the core facts about arguments without reference to\nabstract case or EPP-features. In part two, Haeberli uses and extends this\nmodel so as to account for a wide range of cross-linguistic data taken from\nGermanic.\nThis book is an important contribution, as it explicitly argues for the\nviability of checking theory and its role in the formulation of principles\nand parameters. Although checking theory has been used to account for\nvariation in verb placement (see Bobaljik 1995 and Zwart 1997), it has\nnever before been so extensively applied with respect to parametrization\nin the syntax of A-positions (roughly, possible argument positions that\nexclude topic and focus positions). Although the book is full of ideas,\ntechnical in presentation and far from an easy read, Haeberli takes\nthe reader through things with care. Just as should be the case, this work\ndoes not end on the last page, which is another way of saying that criti-\ncism is not impossible. Unfortunately, a brief evaluation of the main\nproposals of each chapter would exceed the scope of this review. I will,\ntherefore, briefly discuss parts one and two in turn, and then raise some\ngeneral issues.\nThe first part offers a new way of looking at the syntax of arguments. The\ncentral questions are: Why does a clause need to have a subject? Why is\nan object raised to subject position in passive constructions? Why can verbs\ndirectly select nominal arguments, in contrast to adjectives and nouns, as\nseen in (1)?\n(1) (a) to believe (*of) Paul\n(b) afraid *(of) Paul\n(c) the father *(of) the bride\nAlthough abstract case and EPP-features have played an important role\nin answering these questions, Haeberli proposes to eliminate them and\nto use only features that are likely to have some conceptual grounding:\ncategorial features. He proposes that there is a difference between what\ncategories look like in the lexicon and how they have to be interpreted\neventually at Logical Form. An (incomplete) overview is provided\nin (2).\n(2) Lexicon LF-interpretation\n(3) NOUN [+N, +V] [+N, xV]\n(4) VERB [+N, +V] [xN, +V]\n(5) DETERMINER [+D (+N), +T (+V)] [+D (+N), xT (xV)]\n(6) TENSEfinite [+D (+N), +T (+V)] [xD (xN), +T (+V)]\n(7) ADJECTIVE [+N, +V] [+N, +V]\nR E V I E W S\n679\nThat a syntax of arguments exists at all is a consequence of the fact that\nthe wrong positive features have to be eliminated during the derivation. A\nverb, for instance, must be interpreted as [xN, +V] but is positively\nmarked for all its features in the lexicon. It therefore needs to attract a\nnominal phrase, with an interpretable [+N] feature, which can check off the\n[+N] feature on the verb. Conversely, a noun is lexically specified as [+V]\nand needs the verb in order to lose this plus-marking. This pattern repeats\nitself with finite tense, which has to get rid of its [+D, +N] features and\ntherefore attracts a DP to its specifier. If the external argument is lacking,\nas in a passive construction, the object DP will be attracted instead. The fact\nthat every clause has a subject now no longer needs a specific rule : it is\nsimply one instantiation of categorial feature checking, a process which\ntakes place everywhere in syntax. That nouns and adjectives cannot select\nnominal phrases (cf. (1) above) falls out beautifully too. A noun must\nattract a category from its complement with an interpretable [+V] feature,\nand a complement noun crucially lacks this. An adjective, on the other\nhand, is already correctly specified in the lexicon as [+N, +V] and will\ntherefore attract no element from its complement. Hence, a noun comp-\nlement would never get rid of its [+V] specification. Although these\nresults are impressive, there are a few drawbacks. Note that to account\nfor the fact that preposition insertion will render the examples in (1b, c)\ngrammatical, Haeberli has to assume that prepositions are minimally\nmarked [+V], which is not intuitively obvious. Second, one may wonder\nhow the syntax knows whether a [+N, +V] category from the lexicon\nneeds to become a verb or a noun. Therefore, Haeberli is forced to assume\nthat all uninterpretable plus-features are marked as such in the lexicon be-\nfore they enter the syntax. This raises the question of why the lexicon would\nnot specify the categories according to their LF-interpretation to begin\nwith, since marking plus-features as uninterpretable is very close to marking\nthem negatively.\nThe second part of the book deals with cross-linguistic variation within\nthe Germanic languages. Chapter three tries to answer the question of\nwhy German displays more freedom in the ordering of arguments than\nDutch, and offers a new way of relating this to a rich case morphology.\nChapter four tries to account for the fact that some but not all Germanic\nlanguages allow adverbs in between the complementizer (or inverted verb)\nand the subject position. It is argued that having this option depends on\nagreement properties and the availability of an empty expletive in a par-\nticular language. Chapter five aims to incorporate expletives into the\nframework. Parametric differences which are analysed include the fact that\nsome but not all languages have expletive constructions with transitive\nverbs, and the fact that, cross-linguistically, expletives place varying\ndegrees of restrictions on DP-arguments in the clause (that is, whether or\nnot they must be indefinite). Chapter six focuses on Icelandic and offers\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n680\nanswers to two important remaining questions: How do we analyse oblique\nsubjects in this language? How come Icelandic has rich case morphology\nbut nevertheless does not show the same freedom in argument ordering as\nGerman?\nPart two of the book is as ambitious as part one is innovative. It is at its\nbest when apparently unrelated differences are brought together. The fact\nthat Icelandic lacks scrambling of prepositional phrases is related to the\nfact that it also lacks preposition stranding under A-movement. Likewise,\nthe proposal which accounts for the presence of oblique subjects in Icelandic\nis also involved in explaining why it lacks the word order freedom which\nGerman has. The main question that arises for part two is whether, on the\nwhole, the empirical scope is not too ambitious. Two issues in particular are\nrelevant. Let us discuss each in turn.\nThe first issue is the degree of technicality often displayed in the analyses.\nLet me give a concrete example. Haeberli not only offers an account of the\nparametric option of having oblique subjects, present in Icelandic though not\nin German (a difference for which he needs two parameters, in fact), but he\nis also interested in the rather complicated agreement patterns in this con-\nstruction. To account for these, Haeberli introduces specific licensing\nmechanisms, an empty expletive, and a few assumptions about the nomi-\nnative and dative cases and about the number and the order of functional\nprojections. Particularly in a theory where technical details already play a\npivotal role, the result is rather overwhelming and the analysis appears as\ncomplicated as the data.\nThe second issue, partly related to the first, is the degree of arbitrariness\ninvolved in some (but not all) central explanations. I will again provide\none illustration. Haeberli explains the fact that German has a freer argu-\nment ordering than Dutch by referring to the fact of the former having\nmorphological case. He proposes that morphological case triggers the\npresence of syntactic case features that have to be checked. Definite argu-\nments are first moved to TENSEP in order to check the relevant categorial\nfeatures. The syntactic case features, introduced by distinct verbal heads\n(ACCUSATIVE and DATIVE) and TENSE (NOMINATIVE), will all reside in TENSE\nonce the verbal heads have moved to this position. Haeberli then proposes\nthat case features have to be checked in separate projections created on top\nof TENSEP. The order in which these are created is free (for example, NOMP\nbefore DATP, or vice versa). This then leads to free word order effects. As\nDutch has no syntactic case features, the arguments are rigidly ordered\nin TENSEP. There is a crucial arbitrariness involved in this proposal. The\norder in which the different case projections are created is free, according\nto Haeberli, because nothing singles out a particular one. Of course, one\ncould easily invent something, particularly in a framework where the\ntiming of operations is generally made precise ; not specifying the order is\nalmost an anomaly. Under the assumption that the highest case feature\nR E V I E W S\n681\nin the structure (NOMINATIVE on TENSE) has to move first, etc., a rigid (and\nin this instance wrong) order would result, namely DIRECT OBJECT>INDIRECT\nOBJECT>SUBJECT. Haeberli thus shows that an account for the contrast\nbetween Dutch and German can be formulated within the framework\nproposed, but not that it is particularly insightful to do so. Approaches\nwith a more traditional flavour (see, for instance, Bouchard 2001 or\nNeeleman & Weerman 1999, who view case morphemes as indicating how\narguments should be mapped onto a thematic hierarchy), although also\nnot without problems, are less arbitrary and therefore intuitively more\nattractive.\nThis monograph can be seen as an attempt to answer the question:\nWhat would the theory look like if some core principles as well as a\nsubstantial number of parametric differences were cast into one formu-\nlation of checking theory? Although I find that, in general, the theory\nbreaks more ground with respect to the principles than with respect to\nthe parameters, Haeberli at least bites the bullet instead of evading the\nline of fire. Hence, the fact that the theory gets significantly more com-\nplicated as the proposal develops is understandable, given the ambitious\nempirical scope of the book, and cannot negate the fact that the starting\npoint of the enterprise (the elimination of abstract case and EPP-features\nin favour of categorial feature checking) is simply great. Future work will\ntherefore have to decide to what extent this framework can be improved\nand\/or simplified in order to gain more understanding of what does and\nwhat does not cause cross-linguistic variation in Germanic. This will\nhopefully bring us closer to addressing the broader and more funda-\nmental question: Is the \u2018checking\u2019 metaphor the right descriptive, as well\nas explanatory, tool for this particular job? For now, Haeberli deserves\npraise for enabling us to compare in a meaningful way a checking\napproach to the syntax of arguments with the approach taken in other\nframeworks.\nREFERENCES\nBobaljik, J.

Berlin & New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2001. Pp. xx+1855.\nReviewed by ANNA SIEWIERSKA, Lancaster University\nThe many publications, conferences, symposia and workshops devoted to\nthe typological approach to language over the last decade or so clearly testify\nto the fact that linguistic typology has come of age. If, however, one were\nto still harbour doubts as to the maturity of language typology as a field,\nLanguage typology and language universals : an international handbook is\nbound to dispel them. The sheer volume of the work has made it possible for\nthe first time to present the extensive range of typological research currently\nbeing undertaken and to provide some idea of the size and truly international\ncharacter of the typological community. The handbook features 124 con-\ntributions by 108 authors, all experts on the relevant topics, from 20 different\ncountries. The majority of the authors are European or affiliated with\nEuropean institutions. This may come as a surprise to those who associate\nlinguistic typology primarily with the West Coast of the United States, but\nis fully in keeping with the locus of much of current typological work and,\nneedless to say, the institutional ties of the editors. Although the editors\ndo not elaborate on the factors that motivated their choice of contributors\nto the handbook, the impression that one gets is that a conscious effort\nwas made to redress the Anglo-American bias reflected in previous major\npublications on linguistic typology \u2013 such as the four volumes of Greenberg\net al. (1978) or the three volumes of Shopen (1985), or the introductions of\nComrie (1981\/1989) and Croft (1990\/2002) \u2013 and to present a European and\nespecially a German perspective. This is not to say that the contributions to\nthe field of language typology of Anglo-American scholars are neglected\nor down-played, but rather that their work is placed in a more global setting.\nWhile the European orientation of the handbook is highly welcome, the\ndecision to have contributions in three languages, English, German and\nFrench, is not altogether fortuitous. Of the 124 contributions, 39 are in\nGerman and 6 in French. Thus, a third of the contributions are likely to be\ninaccessible to many readers. This is a pity, since the net result may be that\nmuch of the European orientation will be lost precisely on those who it was\nintended to reach.\nThe contributions comprising the handbook are divided into fifteen sec-\ntions. The first seven sections offer a detailed overview of the foundations\nand the historical and theoretical underpinnings of linguistic typology. Sec-\ntion one sets the stage for the ensuing discussion with two contributions. The\nR E V I E W S\n683\nfirst outlines the relationship between language universals and language\ntypology, drawing on different notions of language and different levels\nof observation and abstraction. The discussion includes a consideration of\nthe linguistic as opposed to conceptual nature of universals, their degree\nof innateness and the role played by general principles of perception and\ncognition. The second contribution reviews various approaches to language\ntypology. These include the single-parameter approach, concentrating on,\nfor instance, morphological structure, word order or head- and dependent-\nmarking; the construction-based approach, focusing on a given construction\nsuch as the resultative, passive or causative ; the proto-type approach; the\nhierarchy and scale approach; and the areal approach.\nSection two features nine contributions outlining how the issues of\nlanguage universals and language diversity have been approached in fields\noutside linguistics proper, such as cognitive science, artificial intelligence,\nbiology, genetics, language pathology, the philosophy of language and the\nstudy of different writing systems, as well as in sign language and text\nanalysis. Section three dips into the history of language research and pro-\nvides an overview of the approaches to language universals entertained in\nantiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the European enlighten-\nment. This historical perspective is further pursued in the next five con-\ntributions in section four, which present the views on language typology\nheld by various pre-twentieth-century scholars, both European (e.g. Lamy,\nArnould, Wilkins, Girards, Beauze\u00b4es, von Humboldt) and non-European\n(e.g. Panini, Sibawaihi, Fujitani, Sapir).\nSection five provides an account of the positions on typology espoused\nby four of the well-known schools of typology of the second half of the\ntwentieth century (discussed in greater detail in Shibatani & Bynon 1995),\nnamely Greenberg\u2019s, The Petersburg School, The Paris RIVALC and The\nCologne UNITYP. Also included is an overview of Principles and Par-\nameters, and the approach to typological analysis inspired by the work of\nKlaus Hegers, which has many points of convergence with European and\nAmerican Functionalism.\nSection six considers four types of explanation that have been advanced\nfor language universals and typological preferences, namely those involving\nprocessing ease, iconicity, economy and markedness. The section also con-\ntains a contribution on language sampling and the use of statistical methods\nin typological research. The following fourteen contributions of section\nseven are devoted to the issue of cross-linguistic comparability, which is\nexplored with respect to various textual, semantic and morpho-syntactic\ndimensions, such as event structure, participant roles, parts of speech, tense\nand aspect, reference and predication, deixis, clause linkage, discourse\nstructure and grounding, and contextuality.\nThe theoretical aspects of linguistic typology give way to the empirical\nin sections eight through twelve, which provide an up-to-date account of\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n684\nthe typologies of different language phenomena \u2013 morphological, syntactic,\nphonological and lexical \u2013 and their cross-linguistic distribution in terms of\nboth genetic and areal groupings. Most of the contributions include a dia-\nchronic as well as a synchronic perspective. Section eight consists of\nsix contributions, dealing with aspects of morphological structure: aggluti-\nnation, flection, introflection, compounding, affix position and incorporation.\nSection nine contains nine contributions on different morpho-syntactic cat-\negories, parts of speech, personal pronouns, articles, number, intensifiers and\nreflexive pronouns, modal categories, localizing expressions and adpositions,\netc.\nSection ten, on syntactic typology, opens volume two and, as might be\nexpected, is the largest section of the handbook, featuring twenty one con-\ntributions. Many of the well-studied phenomena are represented: clausal\nword order, voice (passive, reflexive and middle), case marking (of objects),\ncausatives, resultatives, possession (adnominal, internal and external), in-\nterrogatives, existentials, coordination (clausal and phrasal), comparatives,\nconditionals, complement clauses, converbs, focus constructions, dislocations\nand reference tracking strategies.\nSection eleven is concerned with lexical matters. The first three contribu-\ntions discuss different approaches to lexical typology: the cognitive, anthro-\npological and universal primitive approaches, respectively. The following\nsix contributions consider kin terms, derivation, colour terms, spatial ter-\nminology, quantifiers and verbs of perception. Section twelve focuses on\nphonological structure. Five topics are considered: the structure of the\nsyllable, phonological processes, metrical patterns, tone systems and inton-\nation.\nThe last three sections of the handbook deal with the synchronic and\ndiachronic characterization of languages in terms of salient typological\ncharacteristics. Section thirteen explores six well-known parameters of vari-\nation: the bifurcation of languages into syllable-timed vs. stress-timed, finite\nvs. non-finite, subject-oriented vs. subjectless, head-marked vs. dependent-\nmarked, configurational vs. polysynthetic, and discourse configurational\nvs. non-discourse configurational. Section fourteen considers the typological\ncharacterization of language families and linguistic areas. Two contributions\npresenting the principles of areal typology and its relationship to dia-\nlectology are followed by a discussion of the typological convergences\nfound in four acknowledged linguistic areas: Europe and Standard Average\nEuropean, the Balkans, the Sudeten region and Mesoamerica.\nThe final section, fifteen, concentrates on diachronic aspects of linguistic\ntypology. The first nine contributions discuss the typologies of diachronic\nchange relating to a variety of phenomena: processes of lexicalization and\ngrammaticalization, contact-induced typological change, pidginization and\ncreolization, language obsolescence and language death. These phenomena\nare then given more detailed exemplification in the last seven contributions,\nR E V I E W S\n685\nwhich illustrate the typological changes that have taken place over time\nwithin particular language families, namely Romance, Germanic, Turkic,\nAncient Egyptian, Northern Ethiopic and Caucasian.\nAs suggested by the above, the handbook is encyclopaedic in its scope and\ncoverage. One could, however, question the editors\u2019 decision to allocate so\nmuch space to the history of typological research and its connections to other\nfields at the expense of better coverage of the actual patterns of cross-\nlinguistic variation and the factors underlying it. For example, the section\non syntactic typology lacks separate contributions on relative clauses, ap-\nplicative constructions, ditransitive constructions, serial verbs, non-verbal\npredicates, clausal negation, morphological alignment and agreement. Fur-\nther, there is only one contribution devoted specifically to word order and\nthis deals just with the Greenbergian word order correlations. The section\non morphological categories would have benefited from contributions on\ngender, classifiers, evidentiality and case, and the section on phonology from\nan entry on phonological inventories. Arguably a more important omission\nis the lack of a section with contributions discussing the relationship between\nlanguage typology and models of grammar. While the Chomskian view of\nlanguage universals and typological variation finds reflection in several\ncontributions, the positions held and solutions adopted within currently\nexisting functional models of grammar, such as Systemic Grammar, Func-\ntional Grammar and Role and Reference Grammar, or within cognitive\nmodels such as Construction Grammar, do not feature. Particularly supris-\ning is the absence of an entry on the ways in which universals and typological\nmarkedness are dealt with within the various versions of Optimality Theory,\nwhich is mentioned only in the context of the discussion of certain phono-\nlogical issues but not at all in relation to morpho-syntactic phenomena.\nAnother area which receives too little attention, in my opinion, is the meth-\nodology employed in typological research. The only issues that are covered\nwell are language sampling and cross-linguistic comparability. The semantic\nmap approach is illustrated in the contributions on areal typology and Stan-\ndard Average European but is not fully explicated. There is no discussion\nof different methods of data collection and analysis, or a consideration of\nthe role currently played by computerized databases and corpora or a\ncritical evaluation of the value and predictive potential of different types of\nimplicational universals. The absence of a comprehensive discussion of im-\nplicational universals is particularly glaring, given that one of the aims of the\nhandbook, as stated in the preface, is to help experts on individual languages\n\u2018place their language within the space of what is possible and common in\nthe languages of the world\u2019 (vi). Needless to say, this requires a sound\nunderstanding of how implicational universals are arrived at, how they\nshould be interpreted and what exactly they entail.\nThe individual contributions to the handbook differ in length from 3 to\n42 pages (in two columns), most being about 15 pages. They are thus long\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n686\nenough to provide a reasonably good overview of the topic under discussion,\nto air potential areas of controversy and suggest possible new directions of\ninvestigation. The discussions are in the main well illustrated with language\nexamples, separated from the body of the text and adequately glossed. The\nvast majority of the contributions contain quite an extensive list of refer-\nences. Thus, readers whose appetite has been whetted can easily pursue their\ninvestigations further. Unfortunately, very few of the contributions contain\ncross-references to other entries in the handbook. This, however, is com-\npensated for in part by the relatively detailed subject index.\nThe handbook is too expensive for most individuals to buy but it is defi-\nnitely an item which a university or departmental library should have. As\nwith most handbooks, it is meant to be consulted rather than read, to act as\na point of departure rather than as the last word. On the whole, it maps out\nthe terrain of different approaches to the study of language universals and\nlinguistic typology well, though unfortunately mainly for readers of both\nEnglish and German. Readers with English only are likely to be frustrated at\ntimes by not being able to access obviously relevant material. They may,\nhowever, still benefit from the list of references. Sometimes, this is good\nenough.\nREFERENCES\nComrie, B. (1981\/1989). Language universals and linguistic typology: syntax and morphology.\nOxford: Blackwell.\nCroft, W. (1990\/2002).

Malden, MA & Oxford: Blackwell, 2003. Pp. xviii+881.\nReviewed by JOSEPH SALMONS & ANDREA MENZ, University of\nWisconsin\u2013Madison\nThis handbook (henceforth HHL) will be widely read by practicing historical\nlinguists and advanced students. The present reviewers, one from each of\nR E V I E W S\n687\nthose core readerships, are confident that both audiences will gain much\nfrom it. Let us turn directly to the volume, section by section.\n1. ON LANGUAGE, CHANGE AND LANGUAGE CHANGE introduces the volume.\nHandbook introductions inevitably seem perfunctory, but this wide-ranging\nsurvey encompasses a quarter of the volume. Janda & Joseph (henceforth\nJ&J) seek to provide \u2018a particularly revealing and useful perspective on the\nnature of language, the nature of change, and the nature of language change\u2019\n(1). As this suggests, the essay does not shy away from theorizing, supported\nby examples though without empirical trench warfare. J&J discuss phil-\nosophy, history of science, time travel, train car design, Mickey Mouse\u2019s\nhands, and Confederate General George Pickett, but such exuberance\nis tempered frequently by a more careful tone. This style of presentation is\ngenerally engaging, the questions at hand are utterly central, and the answers\nare significant.\nFor example, J&J consider \u2018uniformitarianism\u2019, concluding (35f.) that\nlinguistics and other sciences have a uniformitarian THEOREM, derivable\nfrom parsimony and other independently-needed principles, but no such\nPRINCIPLE. They propose instead \u2018 informational maximalism\u2019, \u2018 the utiliz-\nation of all reasonable means to extend our knowledge of what might have\nbeen going on in the past, even though it is not directly observable \u2019, a worthy\nobligation for HHL and our field and the \u2018sworn duty of every kind of\nhistorian\u2019 (37). On other issues, J&J provide sure-footed discussion of such\nslippery issues as the role of acquisition in change. Elsewhere, diachronic\nlinguists are instructed to look to psychology and sociology rather than\nembracing \u2018the siren of biological organicism\u2019 (10), though J&J are later\nmore positive about biological models (67f.).\nTurning to individual chapters, a valuable feature of HHL is what one\nmight think of as \u2018point-counterpoint \u2019 chapters. Pairs of contributions\ntake somewhat differing (mainstream, seldom polemic) perspectives on\nfundamental questions like the comparative method (Rankin, Harrison),\nphonological change (Kiparsky, Hale), and analogy (Anttila, Hock), with\nmore complex constellations on syntactic change and grammaticalization.\nSome contributors provide fresh arguments, ideas, and data; others syn-\nopsize and review familiar views. Our remarks concentrate on the former.\n2. METHODS FOR STUDYING LANGUAGE CHANGE opens with Robert Rankin\u2019s\n\u2018The comparative method\u2019 and S. P. Harrison\u2019s \u2018On the limits of the com-\nparative method\u2019, which lay out goals, premises, methods and limits of\nthis foundation of linguistic reconstruction in a manner that is thorough,\nyet accessible to the beginning\/intermediate student. They focus their atten-\ntion primarily on how the comparative method applies to phonology,\nbut also touch on morphology, syntax and even the morphology\u2013syntax\ninterface. Both draw attention to much-disputed issues of regularity,\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n688\nuniformitarianism, and naturalness in sound change, which arise repeatedly\nin the introduction and throughout the volume.\nDon Ringe, with his usual clarity and care, treats the methods and limits\nof \u2018Internal reconstruction\u2019, very much in a spirit of informational maxi-\nmalism. The chapter is divided into subsections that focus on \u2018alternations\nresulting from conditioned merger [\u2026] and secondary split \u2019 (245\u2013253 and\n253\u2013257, respectively), and \u2018reconstruction from broader patterns\u2019 (257\u2013\n259). In the last, Ringe draws on the Proto-Germanic strong verb system to\ndemonstrate how internal reconstruction can fill in gaps in the comparative\nmethod, while warning against its over-application.\nLyle Campbell returns to the appropriate application of the comparative\nmethod in \u2018How to show languages are related: methods for distant genetic\nrelationship\u2019. Campbell focuses on how to \u2018distinguish fringe proposals \u2019\nfor distant genetic relationships \u2018from more plausible ones\u2019 (263) and ensure\nthat efforts are dedicated to the latter. The bulk of the chapter catalogs\npitfalls awaiting historical linguists who attempt to establish distant relation-\nships, including, for example, a detailed treatment of \u2018chance similarities \u2019\n(274\u2013277) and an entertaining discussion of \u2018erroneous morphological\nanalysis \u2019 (278).\nJohanna Nichols\u2019 \u2018Diversity and stability in language\u2019 explores why \u2018some\nthings in language are prone to change more rapidly than others, and [\u2026]\nsome things are readily borrowed and others are not \u2019 (283). Nichols con-\nsiders what is involved in developing a \u2018full theory of stability and diversity\n[\u2026 that] account[s] for the probability of various elements of language\nto be inherited or acquired, and the various conditions that may hold\nfor particular elements and scenarios\u2019 (289). This chapter also contains a\npractical survey of the \u2018Relative stability of selected linguistic elements \u2019\nwhich covers everything from segments to word order, with an especially\ngood discussion of gender, exemplified by Niger-Kordofanian and Nakh-\nDaghestanian data (299\u2013303). This section is particularly useful in conjunc-\ntion with advice given earlier on avoiding pitfalls in linguistic reconstruction.\n3. PHONOLOGICAL CHANGE begins with Paul Kiparsky\u2019s \u2018The phonological\nbasis of sound change\u2019, reprinted with minor alterations from the Handbook\nof phonological theory (Goldsmith 1995), which in turn draws on a 1988 hand-\nbook chapter. He treats regularity, phonetic conditioning, \u2018 lexical diffusion\nas analogy\u2019, naturalness and his well-known view \u2018according to which pho-\nnetic variation inherent in speech, blind in the Neogrammarian sense, is\nselectively integrated into the linguistic system and passed on to successive\ngenerations of speakers through language acquisition\u2019 (315). The crux is\n\u2018selective integration\u2019, implying language-specific structure-dependence and\nrequiring underspecification.\nMark Hale\u2019s \u2018Neogrammarian sound change\u2019 presents an explicit\nresponse to Kiparsky. Hale begins with a definition of sound change, \u2018 the\nR E V I E W S\n689\nset of differences between the grammar generating the primary linguistic\ndata used by an acquirer and the grammar ultimately constructed by that\nacquirer \u2019 (345). Hale contests Kiparsky\u2019s \u2018selective integration\u2019 because\nacquirers lack access to rules of the grammar which they have not yet fully\nacquired, and therefore have no structure on which to base selective inte-\ngration (353). He also argues that sound change, qua diachronic event, by\nnature cannot be constrained by Universal Grammar, since it takes place\noutside of the human mind. He advocates recognizing two kinds of sound\nchange: \u2018regular \u2019 and \u2018sporadic\u2019.\nGregory Guy\u2019s \u2018Variationist approaches to phonological change\u2019 is an\nobservant, well-written chapter which provides a solid account of the tremen-\ndous value of variation for the study of sound change. Guy continually\nemphasizes Labovian connections between variation and change \u2013 \u2018there\nis no change without variation \u2026 but not all variation leads to change\u2019\n(370) \u2013 advocating a \u2018quantified or \u2018\u2018variable\u2019\u2019 rule \u2019 model for change\n(375) and a continuum approach to the boundary between phonetic and\nphonological change. Ultimately, Guy sees inaccuracies in Saussure\u2019s\nclaim that \u2018 the opposition between \u2026 the synchronic and the diachronic is\nabsolute and admits no compromise\u2019 (398), arguing for \u2018an integrated view\nof linguistic theory\u2019 (399) which recognizes the sometimes \u2018static \u2019, sometimes\n\u2018dynamic\u2019 nature of language viewed both synchronically and diachron-\nically.\nThe final chapter here is Richard Janda\u2019s \u2018 \u2018\u2018Phonologization\u2019\u2019 as the start\nof dephoneticization \u2013 Or, on sound change and its aftermath: of extension,\ngeneralization, lexicalization, and morphologization\u2019. The arguments are as\nelaborate as this title, examining the border between sound change narrowly\nconstrued and morphologization. On Old High German umlaut, Janda\nargues that \u2018phonologization must precede the loss of a former conditioning\nenvironment, and that morphosemantic, morpholexical factors are likely to\nplay a crucial role thereby\u2019 (412). Janda\u2019s critique of Twaddell raises valuable\nquestions, although the handling of complex Germanic data should raise\nwarning flags for specialists (see Iverson & Salmons 2004). In defence of the\nsame point he also briefly discusses Slavic palatalization. Janda concludes\nwith J&J\u2019s \u2018Big Bang\u2019 theory of sound change in which \u2018purely phonetic\nconditions govern an innovation at its necessarily brief point of origin,\n\u2026 but they are rapidly supplanted by speakers\u2019 imposition of phonological\nand sociolinguistic conditions\u2019 (420).\n4. MORPHOLOGICAL AND LEXICAL CHANGE commences with two perspectives\non analogy. Raimo Anttila\u2019s \u2018Analogy: the warp and woof of cognition\u2019\nfocuses on analogy\u2019s cognitive naturalness. Anttila argues that \u2018traditional\nanalogy, as manifested and known in historical linguistics, was and is\nright \u2019 (433) and ultimately concludes that \u2018analogy is the cognitive glory\nof humans \u2026 [It] must be used in explanation and understanding,\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n690\nproblem-solving, decision-making, persuasion, communications, that is, in\nall kinds of learning or human activity \u2019. Finally, he claims that \u2018 language\nstructure and language use are also predominantly analogical, and this is\nwhy analogy is the backbone of universal grammar\u2019 (438).\nHans Henrich Hock\u2019s \u2018Analogical change\u2019 seeks \u2018to reconcile some of\nthe contradictions in \u2026 perspectives by way of a hypothesis which views\nsound change and analogical (and semantic) change as points on a con-\ntinuum of changes that may be considered analogical in the larger sense \u2019\n(441). He proposes that the degree of regularity of a particular change is a\ndirect result of the kinds of factors conditioning that change. Changes con-\nditioned purely by phonetic\/phonological factors (so-called \u2018Neogram-\nmarian\u2019 sound changes) therefore tend to be more regular than changes\nwhich \u2018minimally involve non-phonetic\/non-phonological information\u2019\n(Hock gives the examples of \u2018Brit.

The chapter also includes interesting discussions of \u2018Sturtevant\u2019s\nParadox\u2019 (450) and \u2018the notion that leveling serves to establish the principle\nof \u2018\u2018one meaning, one form\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (445).\nWolfgang Dressler\u2019s \u2018Naturalness and morphological change\u2019 synthesizes\nprevious research on naturalness. He outlines the framework and history of\nNatural Morphology before moving on to an overview of the various sub-\ntheories, including \u2018type-adequacy\u2019 and \u2018system-dependent naturalness \u2019,\nending with a short summary of the advantages of Natural Morphology.\nThe final chapter, Brian Joseph\u2019s engaging, insightful \u2018Morphologization\nfrom syntax\u2019, begins by convincingly justifying a distinction between gram-\nmaticalization and morphologization, and explaining \u2018how to tell \u2019 whether\n\u2018some phenomenon is \u2018\u2018 in the morphology\u2019\u2019 or \u2026 \u2018\u2018 in the syntax\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (478).\nJoseph presents a detailed illustration of Greek future verbs, taking a stance\nagainst the \u2018claim of unidirectional movement along the cline of grammati-\ncalization\u2019 (484), citing examples (J&J 1988) of \u2018demorphologization\u2019 and\n\u2018(re)syntacticization\u2019 (485), and discussing the possibility of the morpho-\nlogization of \u2018higher levels \u2019 (e.g. pragmatics, page 485). Joseph briefly dis-\ncusses implications of these points for reconstruction, summing up the ways\nin which \u2018recognizing grammaticalization\u2019 can help reconstruction, while\nurging caution in light of the lack of unidirectionality.\n5. SYNTACTIC CHANGE begins with David Lightfoot\u2019s brief \u2018Grammatical ap-\nproaches to syntactic change\u2019 (revised in 1998), summarizing his familiar\nviews on parameter setting in acquisition, and denying any need for distinct\ntheories of change. Certain small differences in primary linguistic data trigger\ncascading, catastrophic changes over long periods of time.\nSusan Pintzuk lucidly explores similar theoretical avenues in \u2018Variationist\napproaches to syntactic change\u2019, with a focus on quantitative, corpus-based\nR E V I E W S\n691\nmethodology. Drawing particularly on Old English (and Germanic) word\norder, she stresses the notion of grammatical competition \u2018between two\ndistinct grammatical options in areas of grammar that do not ordinarily\npermit optionality \u2019 (516). Like many of the best HHL contributions, Pintzuk\nuses her chosen tool deftly while acknowledging that understanding\nlanguage change requires a complete toolbox \u2013 sociolinguistics, psycho-\nlinguistics, etc.\nAlice Harris reviews typological diachronic syntax in \u2018Cross-linguistic\nperspectives on syntactic change\u2019, giving a concise overview of the approach\nto syntactic change put forward in Harris & Campbell (1995).\nMarianne Mithun\u2019s \u2018Functional perspectives on syntactic change\u2019 offers a\nkind of nonformal counterpart to Pintzuk\u2019s chapter \u2013 a concise functionalist\noverview of syntactic change, with a detailed case study. She brings new\nanalyses of Yup\u2019ik and comparative Eskimo, such as extension of deriva-\ntional verbal suffixes into inflectional markers. Mithun is informationally\nmaximalist, even holistic, insisting that analysis of any structure requires\nconsidering its fullest discourse and grammatical contexts.\n6. PRAGMATICO-SEMANTIC CHANGE focuses on grammaticalization, first with\nBernd Heine\u2019s essay by that title. (Andersen (forthcoming) offers extensive,\ninsightful discussion of how this topic is treated throughout HHL.) Heine\nreviews familiar territory, but adds a measured response to grammati-\ncalization critics, illustrated with Greek future ta- (cf. Joseph, above). This\nprovides welcome sharper focus on numerous points, and tempers more\nradical views of grammaticalization, though it probably will not convince\nskeptics. Heine concludes with some \u2018weak predictions\u2019 about patterns of\ncross-linguistic change, for instance that new temporal markers tend to\nevolve from locative markers (598).\nJoan Bybee\u2019s \u2018Mechanisms of change in grammaticalization: the role\nof frequency\u2019 reflects her important prior research, arguing that frequency\nis \u2018a primary contributor\u2019 to (602) and \u2018universal \u2019 in (622) grammati-\ncalization. She builds a fine-grained story of English modal can (<cunnan),\narguing that repetition paradoxically simultaneously promotes reductive\nchange in semantics and phonology while ensuring morphosyntactic\nstability.\nElizabeth Closs Traugott\u2019s \u2018Constructions in grammaticalization\u2019 applies\nConstruction Grammar to grammaticalization, drawing on her earlier work.\nShe redefines grammaticalization as: \u2018 the process whereby lexical material\nin highly constrained pragmatic and morphosyntactic contexts is assigned\ngrammatical function, and once grammatical, is assigned increasingly gram-\nmatical, operator-like function\u2019 (645).\nA refreshing contribution is Benjamin Fortson\u2019s \u2018An approach to\nsemantic change\u2019. Fortson discards taxonomies of meaning change \u2013 as\nwrong-headedly result-oriented, assuming literally no constraints on\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n692\npossible relationships between referents \u2013 for a focus on semantic reanalysis,\nespecially during acquisition, and thus on discontinuity : any \u2018connection\nbetween old and new meanings is illusory\u2019 (652). Distinguishing reanalysis\nfrom social transmission, he situates reanalysis in the ongoing context of\nlexicon creation. The rest of the chapter treats the semantics of grammati-\ncalization, finding little special about grammaticalization. Thus in his view,\nthe development of English modals from full verbs was purely lexical, not\nsyntactic. More important, semantic bleaching is treated as an overvalued\ntendency and epiphenomenal, though \u2018basic metaphorical extensions\u2019 are\nfound repeatedly across languages (658). Fortson\u2019s views, of a sort familiar\nin syntactic or phonological change, feel more novel in the realm of semantic\nchange, and suggest fruitful approaches to this often-neglected subject.\n7. EXPLAINING LINGUISTIC CHANGE leads with John Ohala\u2019s \u2018Phonetics\nand historical phonology\u2019, pursuing his familiar, certainly correct view that\ncomparative linguistics can benefit from scientific phonetics. His overview of\n\u2018the phonetic basis of sound change\u2019 (671) includes accounts of variation\nin both speech production and perception, discussion of whether variation\nequals change, and an outline of how phonetics informs our understanding\nof various kinds of sound changes, for instance dissimilation as \u2018perceptual\nhypercorrection\u2019 (678\u2013680). Ohala concludes that \u2018sound change, at least\nat its very initiation, is not teleological \u2019 and that \u2018 the \u2018\u2018change\u2019\u2019 aspect of\nsound change is not mentalistic and thus is not part of either the speaker\u2019s\nor the listener\u2019s grammar\u2019 (683).\nSarah Thomason\u2019s \u2018Contact as a source of language change\u2019 presents a\nsweeping survey of language contact in its broadest sense, providing some\nrevisions to Thomason & Kaufman\u2019s (1988) model. In contact, as Thomason\nhas long argued, a` la Paul Feyerabend, \u2018anything goes \u2019. Her notion of\nchange \u2018by deliberate decision\u2019 (703f.) reflects a certain casualness : even\nwithout clearly attested examples of conscious change, she draws big lessons\nabout what can(not) happen in language change.\nWalt Wolfram & Natalie Shilling-Estes, in \u2018Dialectology and linguistic\ndiffusion\u2019, provide more discussion of variation and give welcome attention\nto diffusion, with well-developed and sometimes less familiar illustrations,\nespecially from Oklahoma English. The \u2018gravity model \u2019, anchored in social\nvaluation of speech, finds a place alongside \u2018wave\u2019 and \u2018tree \u2019 models. Again,\nthe authors value informational maximalism: understanding dialect dif-\nfusion \u2018obviously calls for a multidimensional approach that considers an\narray of geographical, social, and linguistic factors which may interact in\ndifferent ways\u2019 (733).\nIn the brief \u2018Psycholinguistic perspectives on language change\u2019, Jean\nAitchison sketches two cognitive topics often thought to cause change. On the\nfirst topic, child language, she asks \u2018But why have so many intelligent linguists\nbeen prepared to adopt the \u2018\u2018babies rule \u2019\u2019 viewpoint?\u2019, answering her own\nR E V I E W S\n693\nquestion with \u2018false models \u2026 instilled into generations of linguists \u2019 (739).\nThis derisive tone of certainty is out of step with the volume\u2019s more nuanced\ntreatments of this problem. On the second topic, language processing,\nAitchison gives positive nods to typological work (especially by John\nHawkins) and connectionist\/Optimality Theoretic approaches, acknowledg-\ning, though, that to date the diachronic import of neither has been pursued\nin detail.\nSumming up, HHL proves an atypical handbook in several positive\nsenses, beginning with the introduction\u2019s bold tackling of foundational\nissues. While many chapters offer the expected compact overviews of familiar\ntopics, others are, we hope, destined to become influential as needed lucid\nstatements on particular issues (Ringe, Nichols, Guy, Joseph, Pintzuk,\nMithun) and thought-provoking, original contributions (J&J\u2019s introduction,\nHale, Fortson). Equally noteworthy is the extensive cross-chapter interplay,\nespecially between the almost Hegelian \u2018point\u2013counterpoint \u2019 chapters, but\nalso in the alternating concentration on theory versus practice. Equally\nvaluable are the threads on particular topics that surface repeatedly\nthroughout, such as informational maximalism, language variation, and\nwhat actually constitutes \u2018change\u2019. Language acquisition plays a quirkier,\nmore sporadic role than one might expect, though, and grammaticalization\nmay get more space than it warrants.\nThere are naturally gaps, doubtless driven by space considerations (just\nas for this review). As phonologists, we are disappointed by the decision\nto sidestep prosody\u2019s profound role in language change (117). The import-\nance of prosody is made abundantly clear by Lahiri, Riad & Jacobs (1999)\nand others. While we see no need for detailed treatment of traditional\nlexicostatistics, much exciting work is being published in cladistics and\nquantitative approaches to change.\nRemarkably, we find virtually no typographical errors. Minor issues\nof interpretation or fact do appear. For example, returning to Old High\nGerman umlaut, the claim (18f.) that Alemannic manuscript spellings pre-\nvent an \u2018otherwise certain\u2019 misdating is incorrect ; Gu\u00a8tter (2003) and others\nactually give philological evidence for a somewhat earlier chronology.\nThe value of HHL is multifaceted; its influence will be far-reaching and\nlong-lasting.\nREFERENCES\nAndersen, H.

Pp. xx+385.\nReviewed by MOHAMMAD RASEKH MAHAND, Bu Ali Sina University\nScrambling, or free word order, is a feature of some but not all languages.\nIt was first believed to be a stylistic rule, and there are two approaches to\nstudying scrambling: base-generated positioning or syntactic movement.\nDifferent studies have indicated that the various sorts of scrambling are in-\nstances of A-movement or Ak-movement. The optionality of scrambling has\nbecome a challenge for the Minimalist approach (Chomsky 1995), a theory\nthat allows syntactic movement only if it is triggered by morphological\nfactors.\nThe book under review is the result of the International Conference on\nWord Order and Scrambling, held on April 7\u20139, 2000, in Tucson, Arizona.\nSome new solutions are proposed here to the optionality problem. In recent\nyears, the main trends of research in this area have included the discourse\neffects of scrambling and its relation to Topic\/Focus, the semantic effects of\nscrambling, its acquisition and the interaction between scrambling and\nprosody. Simin Karimi, in her introduction to the volume, briefly reviews the\nliterature on scrambling and the current status of studies on scrambling.\nThe first chapter, by Kenneth Hale, Eloise Jelinek & MaryAnn Willie, is\nentitled \u2018Topic and focus positions in Navajo\u2019, and addresses some problems\nin Navajo sentence structure, arguing that this language belongs to a par-\nametric class of languages which exhibit two particular features at spell-out.\nFirstly, nominals and quantifiers are in operator scope positions at spell-out,\nso it is a Discourse Configurational language; and secondly, it is a Pro-\nnominal Argument language, in which these operators c-command and bind\novert pronominal variables in argument positions at spell-out. The authors\nR E V I E W S\n695\nindicate that the order of the nominal operators reflects Topic\/Focus struc-\nture, while the pronouns are ordered according to their grammatical re-\nlations. It is also argued that an NP in a left-peripheral position may be in\nthe Contrast operator position.\nThe second chapter, \u2018Argument scrambling, operator movement, and\ntopic movement in Hungarian\u2019, by Katalin E\u00b4. Kiss, demonstrates the differ-\nent nature of free word order in three fields of the Hungarian sentence. It is\nshown that the word order of Hungarian in post-verbal position is affected\nby a specificity feature of arguments. The middle field of the sentence consists\nof a strict hierarchy of an aspectual operator, a focus, and distributive\nquantifiers. The topic field of the Hungarian sentence hosts constructions\nwhich are not operators but externalized arguments, functioning as the\nsubjects of predication.\nThe third chapter is \u2018Grammatical relations in Tohono O\u2019odham: an\ninstrumental perspective\u2019, by Mizuki Miyashita, Richard Demers & Delbert\nOrtiz. Tohono O\u2019odham is a pronominal argument language in which pro-\nnominals are discourse variables and their position in a sentence is not the\nresult of movement in the traditional sense. The primary mechanism for\ninterpreting ambiguous sentences in this language involves features of\ndiscourse.\nThe first three chapters are mainly concerned with the interaction of\nscrambling and discourse features. Although they cover some of the major\npoints in each of the three languages discussed, they fail to give a general\naccount of the facts observed. In other words, their descriptions are accept-\nable for each language, but they do not address the universal discourse\nfeatures of this movement.\nThe fourth chapter is \u2018Bare nominals, non-specific and contrastive read-\nings under scrambling\u2019, by Veneeta Dayal. It explores the empirical validity\nof the generalization that scrambling of indefinites correlates with the\nloss of non-specific readings. It is argued that if contrastive readings are\nnon-specific, the generalization has to be restated to prohibit non-specific\nindefinites from scrambling without the additional support of contrast. It is\nalso suggested that leftward scrambling forms a Ground: Link structure.\nThe fifth chapter, \u2018On object positions, specificity and scrambling in Per-\nsian\u2019, by Simin Karimi, examines the syntactic, semantic and morphological\nasymmetries between specific and non-specific direct objects in Persian.\nKarimi proposes a two-object position hypothesis for specific and non-\nspecific objects in this language and explains why scrambling applies freely\nto specific objects but is restricted in the case of non-specific ones. A third\nobject position, created by scrambling, is also proposed, and it is argued that\nscrambling is triggered by discourse features such as topic and contrastive\nfocus. This chapter introduces a new account of short scrambling in Persian,\nparticularly the scrambling of specific objects, but it does not discuss some\nother prevalent forms of scrambling in Persian, such as scrambling to the end\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n696\nof the sentence, or the scrambling of non-specific objects, which goes along\nwith a change in the sentence stress pattern in this language.\n\u2018Scrambling, subscrambling and case in Turkish\u2019 is chapter 6, by Jaklin\nKornfilt. The chapter looks at some new facts about scrambling out of larger\nDPs, or subscrambling, and uses the facts of Turkish to show that there is no\nspecificity effect per se, as an independent principle of grammar. The author\nproposes that incorporation can have different dimensions in different\nlanguages, but is also constrained. Certain properties of incorporation are\nobserved in Turkish, but other properties are not, such as changes in the\nthematic structure of the verb due to incorporation, and complete morpho-\nlogical merge of the incorporated element into its host.\nChapters 4\u20136 are mainly concerned with the relation between scrambling\nand specificity. They make the point that scrambling moves specific nouns\nmore easily than non-specific ones. However, these chapters lack any dis-\ncussion of the exact relation between prosody, contrast and the scrambling\nof non-specific nouns in the languages under discussion.\nChapter 7, entitled \u2018Does Russian scrambling exist? \u2019, is by John Frederick\nBailyn. This chapter argues against the necessity of positing scrambling\nto account for Russian free word order. Instead, the author suggests that a\nsubset of the relevant phenomena are related to a purely syntactic process\nof inversion, a kind of raising to subject, and the rest are related to focus,\nwhich is represented in a unique sub-component of the interpretive interface.\nHe concludes that A-scrambling is in fact generalized inversion, and\nAk-scrambling is dislocation, a prosodic movement related to information\nstructure. Bailyn\u2019s view as introduced in this chapter is that what we know as\nscrambling is not scrambling at all, but a form or forms of other movements,\nsuch as inversion and focus movement. Although his ideas are supported\nhere by evidence from Russian, it seems that focus is at work in scrambling\nin other languages too.\n\u2018A-scrambling and options without optionality \u2019 is chapter 8, by Shigeru\nMiyagawa. The author argues that A-scrambling of the object is driven by\nthe Extended Projection Principle (EPP), and is not an optional movement.\nHe argues that what appears to be an optional rule is simply a situation\nwhereby a language has an independent property or properties which allow\nmore than one option as a way to meet an obligatory requirement. The\nindependent properties essential for EPP-scrambling are verb raising and\nthe occurrence of morphological case marking. Miyagawa attempts to show\nthat scrambling is not optional, at least when it is A-scrambling, but the\nproblem with his suggestions is that in a pro-drop language, where EPP is\nnot satisfied with an overt subject, it cannot be an obligatory force for\nscrambling.\nHelen de Hoop\u2019s \u2018Scrambling in Dutch: optionality and optimality\u2019 is\nchapter 9. The author proposes an optimality theory (OT) analysis for\ntruly optional scrambling of definite objects in Dutch. She introduces two\nR E V I E W S\n697\nconstraints : (1) STAY: no scrambling, and (2) SURFACE CORRESPONDENCE 1\n(SC1): definite NPs scramble. The data show that anaphoric definites\nscramble in two-thirds of all cases, but do not scramble in one-third. Also,\nnon-anaphoric definites scramble in 50 per cent of all cases. The analysis\ncaptures the general tendency of anaphoric definites to scramble. It seems\nthat looking at scrambling from an OT viewpoint can solve some of the\nrecalcitrant problems in the field.\nChapter 10 is \u2018Word order and (remnant) VP movement\u2019, by Anoop\nMahajan. He uses the antisymmetry approach to word order variation\nsuggested by Kayne, and proposes a different way of implementing the\nSOV versus SVO difference. He suggests that V-to-I movement should be\neliminated from the syntactic component. He argues that the OV versus VO\ndistinction may be triggered by the presence of a Determiner feature (for\nobjects) which forces the formation of a VP remnant in OV languages,\nleading to stranding of the object prior to VP-movement to [Spec,IP].\nVaijayanthi Sarma is the author of chapter 11, \u2018Non-canonical word\norder: topic and focus in adult and child Tamil \u2019. Tamil is also a scrambling\nlanguage: this chapter identifies two extraction procedures, leftward and\nrightward, which have the properties of movements to non-argument or non-\nlexical positions. It is argued that scrambling in Tamil mimics topicalization\nor clefting, and it is additionally shown that focusing strategies are inde-\npendent of topicalization strategies. Children are aware of the case restric-\ntions on scrambling and use order shifts to signal interpretive changes like\nadults.\nChapter 12 is \u2018L2 acquisition of Japanese: knowledge and use of case\nparticles in SOV and OSV sentences \u2019, by Noriko Iwasaki. It is observed here\nthat even when L2 learners had knowledge of scrambling, they did not always\naccurately produce scrambled sentences. The gap between an L2 learner\u2019s\nknowledge and performance was not random performance failure, but in-\nstead revealed that L2 Japanese speakers use a canonical sentence template\nas a processing strategy. Chapters 11 and 12 are mainly concerned with the\nacquisition of scrambling. This aspect of scrambling has only recently been\ninvestigated, and the findings will help to uncover the complexities of this\nphenomenon.\n\u2018Scrambling and processing: dependencies, complexity and constraints \u2019 is\nchapter 13, by Irina Sekerina. It is a study of how scrambled sentences\nare processed. The chapter compares sentence processing experiments\nconducted on German, Japanese, Finnish, Serbo-Croatian and Russian, and\ndiscusses the implications for linguistic and psycholinguistic theories of\nscrambling.\nThe last chapter in this volume, chapter 14, is \u2018Wh-movement versus\nscrambling: the brain makes a difference \u2019, by Angela D. Friederici, Matthias\nSchlesewsky & Christian J. Fiebach. It compares two constructions in\nGerman, wh-movement and scrambling. The authors present a number of\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n698\nstudies using event-related brain potentials which show that wh-movement\nand scrambling elicit different brain responses. It is concluded that scram-\nbling in German induces a local syntactic violation while wh-movement\ndoes not. Both of the two final chapters investigate scrambling from a new\nstandpoint, which is helpful in shedding light on its lesser-known aspects.\nOverall, this collection provides thought-provoking material which will\nstimulate much future research. Perhaps the most fundamental question,\naddressed in the first six chapters, is the nature of the relation between\nscrambling and pragmatic features. The optionality of scrambling is dis-\ncussed in the next three chapters. The final chapters are mainly concerned\nwith the acquisition of scrambling and the processing of scrambled sen-\ntences. The issues raised in this book are important for any theory of syntax,\nlanguage acquisition and\/or the syntax-pragmatics interface.\nREFERENCE\nChomsky, N. (1995). The Minimalist program.

Pp. x+316.\nReviewed by GIULIO LEPSCHY, University of Reading & University College\nLondon\nWhen I was asked by the Journal of Linguistics to review this book, which\nI had not yet seen, I responded with pleasure, partly because the questions\ndiscussed in it fall within one of my longstanding areas of interest, partly\nbecause I had reviewed, long ago, three volumes devoted by Konrad Koerner\nin the early 1970s to Ferdinand de Saussure, and I had kept up with\nhis successive work of the following decades. Koerner, who taught for\nmany years at the University of Ottawa before returning recently to\nGermany, is a prodigiously energetic and productive scholar, particularly\nwell known for his activity in the field of the history of linguistics \u2013 as a\nresearcher, editor of more than 350 volumes (published since 1973 under\nthe imprint of John Benjamins, in several series of \u2018Amsterdam Studies in\nthe Theory and History of Linguistic Science\u2019), founding editor of the im-\nportant periodical Historiographia Linguistica as well as of Diachronica, and\nR E V I E W S\n699\norganizer of the triennial International Conferences on the History of the\nLanguage Sciences, first held in 1978.\nKeeping in mind the vastness of the works mentioned above, I wondered\nwhether my unexpected sense of disappointment with the present volume\ncame from a feeling of anticlimax: parturiunt montes. But I do not think so,\nand in the following pages I shall try to explain how my reaction was caused\nnot by excessively high expectations but by some intrinsic limitations of this\ncollection.\nThe book consists of ten essays, followed by a conclusion coyly titled\n\u2018In lieu of a conclusion\u2019. Some of the essays are published here for the first\ntime: the first, \u2018The historiography of American linguistics \u2019, the sixth,\n\u2018On the rise and fall of generative linguistics \u2019, the ninth, \u2018On the origin of\nmorphophonemics in American linguistics \u2019, and the concluding one, \u2018On the\nimportance of the history of linguistics \u2019.\nThe others have been previously published, and the \u2018references to early\nlocations where the subjects treated in the present volume \u2026 have been dealt\nwith in some fashion, in all circumstances in much less developed form\u2019\n(v), are listed in the acknowledgements (v\u2013vi). The chapters, with the date\nof the first printed version in parentheses (in some cases there are also\nlater editions), deal with the following topics : chapter 2, \u2018Towards a history\nof Americanist linguistics \u2019 (1988) ; chapter 3, \u2018On the sources of the Sapir-\nWhorf hypothesis \u2019 (1992) ; chapter 4, \u2018Leonard Bloomfield and the Cours de\nlinguistique ge\u00b4ne\u00b4rale \u2019 (1989) ; chapter 5, \u2018American structural linguistics\nand the problem of meaning\u2019 (1970) ; chapter 7, \u2018Noam Chomsky\u2019s reading\nof Saussure after 1961\u2019 (1994) ; chapter 8, \u2018The \u2018\u2018Chomskyan revolution\u2019\u2019 and\nits historiography\u2019 (1983). In a sort of excusatio non petita, the author states\nthat he has\nalways taken the attitude that one\u2019s intellectual property cannot be copy-\nrighted by others, unless it was written for an encyclopedia or a collective\nwork for which one has received payment and thus traded one\u2019s rights to\na publisher. Cannibalizing one\u2019s own writings \u2026 is fair game. (v)\nThis statement may contribute to explaining (but does not justify) the\nrepetitiveness of many of the comments which reappear again and again in\nthe course of the volume. Cannibalizing one\u2019s own writings may be all right\nfor an author, but is less appetizing for readers who find themselves par-\ntaking of the same entre\u00b4es in different forms and degrees of preparation.\nTo this, one should also add that the style is wooden and sometimes uni-\ndiomatic, and that, to judge from the number of typos, the sub-editor must\nhave been less than careful.\nThere are two questions that seem to be the main preoccupations\nthroughout this volume, to which the author keeps returning in different\nguises and from different perspectives. One, of a general kind, is an attempt\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n700\nto characterize the nature of the history of linguistics and to define the notion\nof \u2018historiography\u2019. The other, more specific point, concerns the notion of\n\u2018revolution\u2019 in science and, more particularly, the question of whether\nChomskyan linguistics should be considered a development (however orig-\ninal and innovative) from structural linguistics, or a radical break (in fact\na revolution) against it. To the nature of historiography the author devotes\nthe concluding chapter of his book. For someone like myself, who was\neducated in Italy around the middle of the last century, the distinction\nbetween history and historiography is obvious. Our culture was based on\nworks such as those of the great historian and philosopher Benedetto Croce,\none of whose books we used to read in secondary school, entitled Teoria\ne storia della storiografia. The terminological distinction between history\n(res gestae) and historiography (historia rerum gestarum) is clear enough,\nand so are the theoretical implications, suggesting that if you want to\nunderstand a historical problem it is desirable \u2013 indeed unavoidable \u2013 to\nstudy the HISTORY of the question, i.e., its historiography. A principled, theor-\netically aware consideration of a historical issue includes its historiography.\nIf this is natural for cultural history but presents peculiar difficulties for\nthe history of science, linguistics (which, for some aspects, seems to belong\nto the sciences, for others, to the humanities) is, from the viewpoint of its\nhistory, particularly problematic. A theoretically sophisticated consideration\nof these questions has been current since the end of the nineteenth century.\nKoerner, however, writes that\nsince the late 1970s, the History of Linguistics has become a recognized\nsubject of serious scholarly endeavour, notably in Europe but also else-\nwhere, and it appears to many in the field that discussion of the subject\u2019s\nraison d\u2019e\u02c6tre is no longer required. (286)\nReaders might agree, were they not tempted to put the date back by about\na century and replace 1980 with 1870. The effect of the comment, which the\nauthor adds in a parenthesis, is therefore rather weakened:\nPerhaps given my long-standing North American exposure in matters\nhistorical, I may be permitted to differ, for my intention had never been to\nconvince people in Germany, Italy, or Spain for instance that a historical\nperspective to our work in linguistics or language philosophy would be\ndesirable. It would have meant carrying coals to Newcastle, since in these\nand many other countries there has been a long-standing tradition of\nseeing subjects in a historical mode. (286)\nWell, yes, this may indeed be true. But then one wonders whether it was\nworth writing a book about the historiography of linguistics, concentrating\non questions which ignore such perspective or treat it as marginal. Besides,\nKoerner states that he is dealing with a NEW perspective, but unfortunately\nR E V I E W S\n701\ndoes not explain in what way the notions he is using differ from the tra-\nditional ones, and what exactly he means by \u2018 linguistic past \u2019 in this context :\nIn my view, what I prefer to call (extending the traditional meaning of\nthe term) the Historiography of Linguistics, by which I mean a principled\nmanner of dealing with our linguistic past, or Linguistic Historiography\nfor short, furnishes the practising linguist with the material for acquiring\na knowledge of the development of their own field. (289f.)\nThe second issue mentioned above concerns the relation between struc-\ntural linguistics and generative grammar. The author comes back to\nthis topic again and again, stressing that he sees it in terms of continuity\nrather than revolution (11f.) : \u2018Chomskyan \u2018\u2018autonomous linguistics \u2019\u2019 has\nmuch more in common with Bloomfield\u2019s linguistic theory and practice\nthan with Sapir\u2019s \u2019 (63). Koerner stresses that one of Chomsky\u2019s doctoral\nstudents, Ray C. Dougherty, who wrote about a Bloomfieldian counter-\nrevolution, mistakenly insisted that Syntactic structures had \u2018initiated a revol-\nution in linguistics \u2019 (108). About the \u2018Chomskyan Revolution\u2019 Koerner\ncomments :\nIn may be a \u2018psychological fact \u2019 for those who want to believe that there\nwas one, but from the point of view of philosophy of science, there is\nlittle evidence that a \u2018scientific revolution\u2019 occurred following the publi-\ncation of Syntactic Structures in 1957. (113)\nAnd again:\nIt has become common-place to talk about a \u2018Chomskyan Revolution\u2019\nin the study of language, with the result that few, if any, would pause to\nthink about what the term \u2018revolution\u2019 implies or is taken to imply. It is\ninteresting to note that it is non-linguists in particular \u2026 who referred to\n\u2018Chomsky\u2019s revolution in linguistics \u2019. (157)\nAnd further :\nDespite many disclaimers, TGG [transformational generative grammar] is\nbasically post-Saussurean structuralism \u2026 However, it cannot be denied\nthat many young men and women in linguistics during the 1960s and\n1970s believed they were witnessing a revolution in the field, and it appears\nthat this widespread belief (and the associated enthusiasm that young\npeople tend to generate) has been, I submit, at the bottom of the\n\u2018Chomskyan revolution\u2019. (163)\nOne could continue with more and more passages of a similar tenor :\nthere has been much more continuity and cumulative advance in American\nlinguistics than we have been made to believe both by the active partici-\npants in the \u2018revolution\u2019, the followers, and the court historians (210) ;\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n702\nand \u2018there was more evolution than revolution occurring in American\nlinguistics during the 1940s and 1950s\u2019 (224) ; the \u2018practitioners\u2019 rhetorical\nclaims of revolutionary turns and paradigmatic incommensurabilities \u2019 must\nbe reconciled \u2018with evidence that, in hindsight, suggests more continuity and\ncumulative advance (or in some cases even regression) \u2019 (245).\nMaking the same point over and over again inevitably causes a sense\nof tedium. But this is not just due to the repetitiveness of the individual\nessays. The difficulty is more serious since it seems to me that it is\npointless to discuss whether a theory represents a revolution or an evol-\nution. The question itself is not capable of a sensible definition or a\nmeaningful answer. The etymology and cultural history of the term \u2018rev-\nolution\u2019 is of course an interesting topic, and the study of various uses\nand implications of the term, in different areas and periods, may be\ninstructive and rewarding. Designations such as \u2018French revolution\u2019,\n\u2018October revolution\u2019, \u2018 Industrial revolution\u2019, \u2018Copernican revolution\u2019, etc.\nare well established and their use is fairly standardized (although initials\nmay be lower case or capitalized), and it is perfectly reasonable to try to\nclarify the phenomena in question, or to look at them in a new light. For\ninstance, as I was writing this review, I went to see at the National\nTheatre in London David Hare\u2019s new play The permanent way. The pro-\ngramme notes print an interesting piece by Ian Jack in which the history\nof railways is traced, and it is stated that \u2018the Industrial Revolution,\ncontrary to its name, arrived by increments \u2019. This is a good point to\nmake, in the relevant context, and it clarifies the argument. Of course it is\nlegitimate to point to elements of \u2018continuity\u2019 which link the present to\nthe past, but it would be frivolous to insist that one should therefore\nnot talk of an industrial \u2018revolution\u2019. In any case, the nearer in time a\ncultural change is to us, the more difficult it may be to decide whether its\ndesignation has in fact become established or whether it is a question of\na controversial usage, adopted by some and rejected by others. The fascist\nregime in Italy, while it was in power, used to talk of the \u2018Fascist Rev-\nolution\u2019, but since it fell from power the designation has become obsolete.\nThe situation is even more problematic in the case of titles such as Kuhn\u2019s\n\u2018structure of scientific revolutions \u2019. Here too, notwithstanding the attempts\nto define the replacement of one paradigm by another, it seems fruitless\nand unrewarding to argue whether a hypothesis belongs to this or that\ntrend, rather than discussing the relevant questions of substance. Trying\nto prove that a work fits into one or another paradigm (assuming that\nthis notion makes sense), for instance, whether Saussure\u2019s Cours or\nChomsky\u2019s Syntactic structures belong to structural linguistics, or different\nparadigms altogether, seems to me to have become a pointless exercise,\nparticularly when one is left with the impression that an empty termin-\nological game is being played, and few substantive questions are being\nclarified.\nR E V I E W S\n703\nConcerning the relative positions of Saussure, of different structuralist\ntrends, European and American, and of the various developments of\nChomskyan linguistics, the situation was controversial from the start,\nand was clearly presented in the relevant works written in the sixties\n(see, for instance, Lepschy 1966: 37\u201339, 180\u2013183 and the bibliography\nquoted there ; also Lepschy 1992: 57f.), and in the best of the more modern\naccounts (such as Matthews 1993, 2001). My impression is that Koerner\u2019s\ndiscussions add little of substance and, if anything, leave the situation\nmore confused than it was, distracting readers from the intellectual issues\ninvolved and diverting their attention towards topics which are alleged\nto be culturally, ideologically and politically important but in fact turn\nout to concern petty questions of personal rivalry and self-seeking\ncareerism, attributed mainly to linguists of a generative persuasion. This\nkind of documentary research, masquerading as sociological history, is\nfrequently based on gossip, mean interpretation of private correspon-\ndence, malevolent imputing of base motivations. I feel that readers may\nreact with irritation, as I did, at the manner in which criticisms are\npresented or reported in these essays. As above, I think that, rather than\noffering a detailed analysis, the point can best be proved by offering a\nseries of quotations which illustrate the temper of this book\u2019s attitude.\nFor instance:\n\u2026 one cannot help noticing that he [R. A. Harris] uncritically accepts\nat face value Chomsky\u2019s self-serving accounts of what American linguis-\ntics was like during his formative years. (113)\n\u2026 the picture that [R.A.] Harris draws of his [Chomsky\u2019s] character on a\nvariety of occasions \u2013 the manner in which he fights his adversaries, his\nattitude toward the \u2018 intellectual property\u2019 of others, and his human\nshortcomings generally \u2026 is anything but complimentary. (114)\nConsider also the appeal to \u2018keen observers of Chomsky\u2019s technique of\ncovering up his true sources of theoretical insight by referring to other, in\nfact quite unlikely candidates\u2019 (145, note 17).\nAs for Morris Halle, \u2018Chomsky\u2019s longtime supporter and ally \u2019 (166), he\nappears as the sinister organizer, administrator and academic politician\nbehind the Chomskyan \u2018revolution\u2019. A visitor at MIT in 1962, before the\nInternational Congress, watched \u2018Morris Halle plot as if he were Lenin in\nZurich\u2019 (172). Koerner observes that\nIf we take the Communist overthrow of the Tsarist regime in Russia in\n1917 as an example, we may detect some similarities between this social\nand political revolution and what happened in American linguistics\nduring the 1960s. I am thinking in particular of the manner in which\nrepresentatives of the ancien re\u00b4gime were treated (they may not have\nJ O U R N A L O F L I N G U I S T I C S\n704\nlost their lives, but many academic careers of those who did not join\nthe new faith were negatively affected, some were ruined) and, what is of\nspecial interest in the present context, of the manner in which history\nwas rewritten, memory of the immediate past was obliterated and replaced\nby something else. (214)\nThe MIT Linguistics Department flourished\non the strength of the tremendous sums of money that flowed into its\ncoffers during the 1960s and early 1970s. While it would be unfair to say\nthat money alone has made the success story of TGG possible \u2013 to main-\ntain such a view would mean to deny the existence of human resourceful-\nness and creativity (not in the Chomskyan sense, nota bene !) \u2013 nevertheless\nevery researcher knows the importance of funding for any project s\/he\nmight conceive. (168f.)\nThe overall effect of these comments seems to me depressing, particularly\nwhen one compares their pettiness with the unmistakable sense of intellectual\nvigour and originality, indeed of sheer genius, which one feels when one\napproaches an essay written by Chomsky \u2013 irrespective of the fact that one\nmay disagree with any individual suggestion, and indeed with many of his\nhypotheses concerning the history of linguistics.\nIn order to end on a more upbeat note, I shall observe that in chapter 2,\ndevoted to Americanist linguistics, readers will find many useful and in-\nformative comments to which no doubt they will wish to refer in future, if\nthey deal with this interesting and insufficiently known area. Koerner makes\ngood use here of modern studies, and makes helpful comments on the history\nof so-called \u2018missionary linguistics \u2019, and on many figures who still deserve\nto be studied in greater detail such as John Pickering, Jonathan Edwards,\nAlbert Gallatin, Pierre E\u00b4tienne Du Ponceau, and many others. He concludes\nthat\nIt is this long-standing tradition of work on Amerindian languages which\nexplains that American linguists did not need to read Saussure\u2019s Cours\nin order to focus on the descriptive, \u2018synchronic \u2019 side of language struc-\nture. (30)\nIn what way exactly this can be linked to the main theme of this volume,\nhowever, is a question which would require a more complex discussion.\nREFERENCES\nChomsky, N. (1957).
