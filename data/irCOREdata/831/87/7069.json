ISBN: 1-871516-23-4.\nThe term typography refers to the style,\narrangement, appearance, and design of\ntypefaces and typeset material. In this book,\nSassoon rightly assumes that typography\nnow extends way beyond words printed on\npaper, and in particular to the world of\ncomputers, where alphanumeric information\ndisplayed on a screen is often as important as\nprinted output. Both forms of typography are\ndealt with here. The book consists of eleven\nchapters, written by a variety of different\nauthors, and grouped together into five main\nsections, each one covering a different aspect\nof typography.\nSection 1 (Spacing and layout) contains\nthree contributions. The first of these pro-\nvides an introduction to 'text massage',\nbasically summarizing half a dozen guide-\nlines for improving textual presentation by\nmeans of various massaging techniques. The\nchapter is simple and brief, though unfortu-\nnately its brevity also means that the guide-\nlines described are not supported by any\nreferences to relevant research in the field.\nThe second contribution in this section\naddresses the concept of layout. This is\nachieved by illustrating two versions of a\nquestionnaire, each making use of a slightly\ndifferent spatial arrangement. The impor-\ntance of white space in the design of textual\ninformation is discussed in the context of\ninformation highlighting and the provision of\nstructural cues. The final chapter in the\nsection looks primarily at rules of composi-\ntion. It discusses the effects of inter-character\nand inter-sentence spacing. Rules based on\nthe use of various character shapes and\npunctuation marks are also presented - there\nfor determining optimal sizes for the spacing\nused in presenting text.\nThe second section (Typographic choices -\nLatin and other alphabets) contains two\npapers (as do all the remaining sections). The\nfirst paper describes some of the problems of\nusing alphabets other than Latin, with major\nconsideration given over to handling Hebrew\non a computer. The problems involved in\ncreating multilingual documents are also\nconsidered. The second paper discusses the\nflexibility provided by computers with\nrespect to typography in general, the variety\nprovided by font types and the control of\ninter-letter spacing. There is also a discus-\nsion of the costs involved in fine-tuning\ncomputer-based text.\nThe third section is entitled Technical issues\nin type design. The first paper here describes\nvarious aspects of the effects of technology\non type design, one of the principal effects\nbeing found in screen or printing resolutions.\nLow resolutions can result in a syndrome\nknown as 'the jaggies': low-quality text with\njagged edges. The chapter concludes with a\ndescription of the development of type\ndesign and font production tools. The second\npaper deals with character description\ntechniques in type manufacture. Four\ntechniques are described, two used in the\nproduction of metal type, and two relating to\nbitmap font production and mathematically\nspecified contours (both used in the manu-\nfacture of digital type).\nThe two papers making up the fourth section\nof the book (Lessons to be learned from the\nhistory of typography) each relate to the\ncomplications of computerisation. The first\ndeals with education in the context of\nwriting. Problems relating to the use of\ncomputers in the development of writing\nskills are discussed, and arguments for the\nimportance of handwriting are presented.\nThe second paper discusses the impact of\ncomputerization (particularly, in the form of\n70\nAu-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\ndesktop publishing) on traditional\ntypesetting, and the implications of the\n'democratisation' of typesetting, through the\nwide availability of desktop-publishing\nsoftware, are debated.\nThe two papers in the final section of the\nbook come under the heading Research and\nthe perception of type. The first deals with\nresearch into typography and reading, with\nparticular reference to the lack of research\ninto the effects of the typographic features of\ntext on children. The chapter includes both a\nsurvey of teacher attitudes towards type\nsuitable for children and a description of\nresearch into the effects various type forms\ncan have on children's ability to read and\nwrite. The final paper of the book is devoted\nto the visual analysis of text. Obviously,\nsince the human visual system is fixed, it is\nessential that the features of textual material\nare designed to match its inherent limita-\ntions. The paper presents a method for the\ncomputational analysis of textual layouts\nwhich might be useful in analysing the\npotential of various changes to typesetting\nparameters.\nThis book is aimed not only at those inter-\nested in typography for its own sake but also\nat anyone who wants to produce profes-\nsional-looking documents with a computer.\nIn its latter aim, in my view it is only\npartially successful. Much of the work\nattempts to convince the reader that typogra-\nphy is essential to creating quality computer-\ngenerated documents, but although guide-\nlines for good typographic practice are\noffered, these are not generally brought out\nclearly enough.\nFurthermore, as is often the case in multi-\nauthor works, the different writing styles of\nthe various authors result in some chapters\nbeing easy to read, and others less so. The\nwork would also have benefited from some\nform of conclusion drawing together the\nmajor findings of the papers.\nStephen Richards, University of Teesside\nActive Library on Corrosion by W.F.\nBogaerts and K.S. Agema, a CD-ROM\npublished by Elsevier Science Pub-\nlishers (Amsterdam) and the National\nAssociation of Corrosion Engineers\n(Houston, Texas), 1992. ISBN: 0-444-\n89607-4.\nFor a variety of reasons, electronic books\npublished on CD-ROM are valuable learning\nresources, and publishers are increasingly\nrealizing the many attractive advantages they\noffer. The Active Library on Corrosion\n(ALC) is just one of many publications\nElsevier intends to produce as part of its new\nActive Library series. The ALC runs under\nWindows on an IBM PC or compatible fitted\nwith an internal or external CD-ROM drive\naccessible via the Microsoft CD extensions\n(MSCDEX). The software is fairly easy to\ninstall from the CD-ROM it is supplied on,\nand requires about 3.5 Mb of hard-disk\n.space.\nThe Active Library concept is essentially a\ngeneric hypermedia shell into which can be\nplugged a range of different specialized\nsubject-orientated materials. The shell is\nwritten in GUIDE, the hypermedia authoring\ntool marketed by Office Workstations\nLimited (OWL) and widely used in many\nBritish universities for developing interactive\nteaching material. Two of the reasons why\nGUIDE was chosen for this project are (a)\nthe ease with which hypertext links can be\ncreated, and (b) its ability to handle SGML\n(Standard Generalized Markup Language). \u2022\nSGML was used to mark up many of the\nelectronic documents prior to importing\nthem into GUIDE for interlinking using a\nspecial tool called GUIDE Writer. A good\nrange of electronic tools is available within\nthe system. Functions include specific\nsearches (searching and consulting for\ninformation relating to a specific query),\nhighlighting and annotating documents or\nparts of documents, browsing (associations\nbased on links, with back-tracking fully\nsupported, and current awareness (providing\n71\nReviews\nup-to-date information on a specific field of\ninterest through a user-profile). Two other\nimportant facilities (based on path function-\nality) are Hitlists and Trails. Hitlists are\nsystem-generated collections of related\ndocuments, and Trails are user-defined\nsequences of interesting documents held\nwithin the knowledge corpus.\nThe ALC contains 6,000 documents covering\na broad range of topics in the subject-area of\ncorrosion engineering. It is made up of eight\npreviously published reference works and\n1,200 newly created documents written by\nleading corrosion experts. It also contains\nover 2,000 images (mostly full-colour), 600\nformatted tables, and numerous mathemati-\ncal and chemical formulae. The system, then,\nhas a very large amount of information in it,\nand in order to give readers a sense of where\nthey are in the publication,, the information is\norganized around the use of a library meta-\nphor designed to provide a mental reference\nmap.\nAfter the ALC is started by clicking on its\nWindows icon, one of the initial top-level\nscreens is used to show readers the Library\nMap. This indicates all the available library\nsections that can be accessed by clicking on\nappropriate buttons. Within the individual\nsections themselves, other maps are provided\nto aid navigation and to prevent readers from\ngetting lost. The main Library Map provides\neight basic access mechanisms into the ALC\nsystem. These are the Reference Cube, Case\nHistories, Corrosion Control, Quick Refer-\nence, Books, Databases, Dictionary and\nHelp.\nThe Reference Cube is an innovative three-\ndimensional table of contents in which the\nreader can specify a combination of corro-\nsion type and\/or material and\/or environ-\nment. Using the specifications entered by a\nparticular reader, the Reference Cube can\nconsult its underlying database and provide\nthat reader with relevant information, which\nmay be a single document or a collection of\ndocuments.\nThe Case Histories section contains a\ndatabase of 400 cases of corrosion damage\ntaken from During's Corrosion Atlas.\nThe Corrosion Control section is a collection\nof documents which give an overview of\ngeneral corrosion control measures and\ntypical measures against different corrosion\ntypes. It also presents discussions on indi-\nvidual techniques of corrosion prevention.\nThe Quick Reference section is based on the\nNational Association of Corrosion Engineers'\n(NACE) reference book. It embeds an\nextensive set of look-up tables containing\ncorrosion and materials background informa-\ntion, and it includes a glossary for readers\nwho are not familiar with corrosion engineer-\ning.\nThe Books section contains the four books\nnow regarded as standard works in the field\nof corrosion engineering and corrosion\nprevention. Each has been converted to\nhypertext form, and so are integrated into the\nmain body of documents stored in the ALC.\nThe Database section contains two standard\nNACE databases (COR-SUR and COR-\nSUR2) which together document the per-\nformance of 25 metals and alloys (in more\nthan 1,000 chemicals and corrosive environ-\nments) and 36 non-metals (in more than 850\nchemicals and corrosive environments). For\nnon-expert users, the Dictionary section\nprovides alphabetical access to a comprehen-\nsive selection of corrosion terminology.\nSimilarly, for new users of the ALC the Help\nsection contains online help information on\neach of the other library sections, along with\na series of tips on the basic use of the\nsystem.\nALC is aimed primarily at corrosion engi-\nneers, and is intended to serve as a reference\nwork for day-to-day use as well as a source\nof information on less common corrosion\nproblems, but it will be an extremely useful\nasset in many an academic library or labora-\ntory. It is produced to a very high standard\nboth in terms of its content and its usability.\n72\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nIndeed, it sets a standard for electronic\npublication that many other publishers will\nfind difficult to exceed.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nA Handbook of Computer-based\nTraining by Christopher Dean and\nQuentin Whitlock, 3rd edition, 1993,\nLondon, Kogan Page. ISBN: 0-88415-\n088-7.\nThe title A Handbook of Computer-based\nTraining is somewhat misleading. Two thirds\nof the book deal directly with the subject, but\none third is a general description of different\naspects of computer systems covering, for\nexample, the difference between microproc-\nessors, minicomputers, and mainframes;\nwhat functions operating systems perform;\ndescriptions of a number of input devices,\nand so on. The authors might rightly argue,\nhowever, that this information is useful for\npart of the intended readership. A training\ndepartment, for example, might use comput-\ners for word-processing and spreadsheets and\nnot really appreciate the computing details of\nthose systems. If they were thinking of\nadopting Computer-Based Training (CBT)\nfor much of their central work, this basic\ncomputing information would be valuable.\nAnd indeed, for anyone who secretly wants\nto be initiated into the world of computers,\nthis book presents a balanced overview to a\nreasonable depth. I have a few niggles. For\ninstance, the lower-case m used in mega-\nbytes (a very common error in newspapers,\nbut not one that should appear in a technical\nbook), or the description of a light emanating\nfrom a lightpen which leads the reader to\nassume that the light plays a part in the\ndetection mechanism, when in fact it only\nprovides feedback to determine where the\npen is pointing. But these are the niggles of a\npedant.\nSo what about the major part of the book that\ncovers CBT? One of its pleasing aspects is\nthe emphasis it gives to professional produc-\ntion: it dispels any thought that the job\nshould be given solely to a junior program-\nmer in the computing applications group as a\nspare-time pursuit The production of CBT\nrequires the same detailed planning as does\nany software project, but the personnel\ninvolved must have knowledge of the topic\nbeing conveyed, the authoring software, the\ntechniques for teaching, the artistic skills to\ndesign material that has the necessary impact\non the trainee, and an awareness of the skills\nand experience of the typical trainee. Thus\nCBT material is often prepared by a team\nrather than one individual, and no team\nmember is likely to be particularly skilled in\nwriting conventional software (although in\nsome cases such a team member may be\nnecessary).\nOther key points raised in the book are that\nCBT is rarely used alone, but is usually\ncombined with other media such as\nvideotape and paper booklets.\nThe authors emphasize the need to pre-test\nand post-test to determine how much stu-\ndents have really learnt using the CBT\nsystem, and that the body of the lesson\nshould not be conveyed merely by 'page\nturning'. Instead, trainees should be regularly\nactive, with their responses determining their\npath through the material. A number of\nsituations are described, illustrating how\nCBT has been employed. The authors point\nout that not all situations demand a CBT'\nsolution (for example a video might be\npreferable).\nThe book is oriented towards the front-end of\nCBT development. Is CBT really needed in\nthis case? What is needed? Have the pro-\nspective trainees been consulted as to what\nthey require? What are the arguments for the\nvarious strategies for CBT provision? What'\nare the financial implications for the strat-\negy? What are the computer resource\nimplications for the strategy? And so on. All\nwell answered for the prospective CBT\norganizer to use in discussion with higher\nmanagement.\n73\nReviews\nThe book describes how the outline plan is\nbroken down into constituent elements and\nhow this is organized, planned, managed,\nand executed. It includes descriptions of the\ntools that may be available for specifying the\npaths through the material and the instru-\nments that might be used to document the\ndesign. It also describes the tools that\nmanage the training sessions, including\ntrainee records and progress, and methods for\ndirecting students through the course.\nHowever, how teaching skills are exploited\nin the user-interface, and how the perceptual\nworkings of the human are exploited are not\ncovered except at a very superficial level.\nAgain, the authors might argue that what\nthey do cover is all that is necessary for the\nCBT material currently produced. However,\nwith computer systems increasingly being\nmore graphically interactive, and CBT\ndesigners intent on exploiting that fact,\nfurther guidance is needed to ensure that the\nuser-interface does not confuse the trainee.\nThe authors do describe a system which fails\nto pick up the fact that the supporting\nmaterial the trainee is meant to have while\nusing the computer is absent, despite the\ntrainee identifying the problem to the\ncomputer. This was a failure in the interface,\nbut little guidance is given as to how to\navoid the problem. Tips from experienced\ndesigners would have been valuable.\nThis is nevertheless a useful book for the\ntraining manager's bookshelf. It is particu-\nlarly aimed at the manager who is to intro-\nduce CBT, and that person will be made\naware 6f the computing resources needed,\nthe skills needed of those who will be\ninvolved in its production and maintenance,\nand the stages involved in producing CBT\nmaterial. It briefly describes the functionality\nthat can be expected in software such as\ncourse-authoring tools, computer-managed\nlearning tools, and flowchart tools. It does\nnot (nor should it) go into how these tools\nachieve their results. Perhaps the fourth\nedition might include more detail of screen\ndesign, particularly those aspects that must\nbe foremost in the designer's mind while\ndeciding the best way of conveying specific\nmaterial.\nI.D. Benest, University of York\nLearning Conversations by S. Harri-\nAugstein and L. Thomas, London,\nRoutledge, 1991. ISBN: 0-415-02867-1.\nIn reviewing the development of courseware,\nit is rare to read of the educational or psy-\nchological reasons driving that development.\nAll too often, computational, technical or\neconomic issues dominate. Perhaps in the\navoidance of this 'why' question, it is\ninevitable that a book should appear that\nchallenges almost all the conventional\nwisdoms at once, which fires harmonious\ncannons at practical experience and offers a\nnew model on which all resources for\nlearners should be built.\nIn their book, Sheila Harri-Augstein and\nLaurie Thomas review 40 years of action\nresearch to draw out a unifying theory of\nbehavioural and experiential psychology, and\nEastern and Western philosophy. The funda-\nmental premiss of the thesis is that conversa-\ntion is priori, and learning is a skill which\nitself can be learnt.\nThe book is divided into three main parts.\nThe first looks at learning and how cultural\nand historical precedents have acquired a\nlanguage to describe the process of learning\nwhich might be generalized as modelling\nmeaning. Five types of meaning are identi-\nfied, ranging from 'rote' to 'creative' - an\nincreasing awareness of the learning process\nbeing seen as the key to moving from one to\nthe other.\nThe second part looks at the role of the\n'learning conversation' in helping this\ntransition occur. The 'life', 'task' and\n'learning to learn' phases are identified,\nwhich can be thought to map learners'\npurposes, experiences and interpretation of\nrecords in computerized systems. The\n74\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\n'monitor, analyse, record, reflect, recon-\nstruct' heuristic is described and exemplified\nby tools used to structure learning conversa-\ntions and make the learning process explicit.\nTraditional measures of ability are shown to\nreflect a learner's ability to internalize\nlearning conversations and become more\nself-organized.\nThe third part looks at how self-organization\ncan be encouraged. In passing, many anecdo-\ntal findings of others are explained: for\nexample, why, when the effectiveness of a\ncomputer-based resource is compared with\nits paper-based equivalent, no significant\n'size effect' can be measured. The learner's\nability to converse is shown to encapsulate\nhis\/her potential to learn. A radical challenge\nis made to the current educational establish-\nment to improve the quality of the conversa-\ntions they manage and remove what are\nrevealed to be barriers to learning compe-\ntence.\nThe expansive appendices and postscript\nillustrate the authors' ideas with remarkable\nclarity and give plenty of scope for further\nreading. One of particular interest focuses on\nthe requirement for computer-based re-\nsources that support self-organized learning.\nThey give a reasoned explanation for the\ncommon finding that as objectives become\nmore experimental, computer-based reflexive\ntools are more effective than rubrics. Indeed,\ngaining a language to talk about learner's\nexperiences and environments is one of the\nmain benefits to be gained from this book.\nThe omission of a bibliography does not\ndetract from the work as a whole; references\ncan be obtained from the authors.\nIn the light of previous reviewers' remarks,\nany further comment seems superfluous:\n'I commend [...] Learning Conversations as\nan important work to be widely read'.\nProfessor Gordon Pask (founder of Cyber-\nnetic theory).\n'I believe Learning Conversations is a book\nno psychologist or teacher should be with-\nout'. Dr David Fontana (Editor of the\nPsychology for... series).\n'The S-O-L system has enabled [...] progress\ntowards higher productivity'. Sir Bryan\nNicholson (CBI Educational Training Affairs\nCommittee).\nMartin Reynolds, University of Manchester\nCollins Electronic English Dictionary\nand Thesaurus, San Francisco CA,\nReference Software International,\n1992.\nThe Collins Electronic Dictionary is just one\nexample of what is becoming an increasingly\npopular type of reference work for use with a\npersonal computer system. This particular\npublication was originally produced by\nReference Software International but is now\ndistributed and maintained by the Word-\nPerfect Corporation.\nThe IBM PC version of the product is\nsupplied as a set of seven 3.5 inch disks that\nhave to be installed in a separate directory on\nthe PC's hard-disk drive. The system takes\nabout 15 to 20 minutes to install, and\nrequires about 9 Mb of hard-disk space for\nfull installation. The software itself is made\nup of four basic modules: the dictionary\n(which requires 5.7 Mb), the thesaurus (1.02\nMb), the pronunciation guide (0.54 Mb), and\nthe etymology module (1.1 Mb). The only\nmodule that must be installed is the diction-\nary. \u2022\nThe dictionary is based on the 3rd edition\n(1991) of the paper-based version of the\nCollins English Dictionary and the Collins\nThesaurus (1984). Together, these make\navailable 190,000 definitions (comprising\n3.5 million words of text) and over 275,000\nalternatives for 16,000 main-entry words.\nEntries in the dictionary contain pronuncia-\ntion details as well as etymological informa-\ntion. A relatively simple manual is provided,\ngiving details of how to install the product\nand how to use it. It is quite easy to read yet\n75\nReviews\nfairly comprehensive in its treatment.\nUnfortunately, however, in some places it is\ninaccurate - for example, the telephone\nnumber for hotline support is incorrect, as\nare some of the instructions for running the\nsystem.\nOnce installed, the dictionary can be invoked\nin either of two ways: as a free-standing\nconventional program, or as a Terminate and\nStay Resident (TSR) system. Each of these\nmodes of operation is available within DOS\nand Windows. The TSR version requires the\nuse of hotkeys, and has to be unloaded when\nit is no longer needed. Once the program has\nbeen invoked, the system provides the same\nbasic user-interface and facilities no matter\nwhich mode is being used.\nThe user-interface is in three parts: a hori-\nzontal menu bar running across the top of the\nprogram's display window, a central display\narea for presenting word definitions (and\nother information), and a second horizontal\nmenu bar running across the bottom of the\ndisplay window. There are seven entries in\nthe topmost menu bar: Dictionary, Thesau-\nrus, Search, History, Options, Quit and Help.\nQuit simply terminates the dictionary and\npasses control back to the program that\ncalled it - either DOS (or Windows) or an\napplication (such as a word-processing\npackage or a text editor).\nHelp provides access to a pop-down menu\nthat offers a number of different choices such\nas Pronunciation, Glossary and so on. The\nrange of help facilities available depends on\nwhether the Windows or the DOS version is\nbeing used.\nThe Options entry allows users to customize\nthe dictionary to individual needs - by\nchanging the colour scheme for display\nwindows, case sensitivity (in searching),\nmatching criteria, and so on.-\nThe History option can be used to obtain a\nlist of the last 16 items retrieved from the\ndictionary or thesaurus.\nThe Dictionary and Thesaurus options create\ndialogue boxes allowing the entry of words\nto be looked up in the dictionary and thesau-\nrus respectively.\nThe Search menu option provides three\ndifferent word-search options within the\n'dictionary: definition search, anagram and\nwildcard. The most powerful of the three is\nthe definition search. This searches every\ndefinition in the dictionary in order to find\nentries that contain selected keywords,\naccording to criteria that have been estab-\nlished using a special Search command. Such\ncommands contain keywords connected by\nthe logical operators AND, OR and NOT.\nThe results retrieved in any particular search\nwill depend on whether or not case sensitiv-\nity has been selected, and also upon the\nexactness level specified. Wildcard searches\nuse the two symbols ? and * within a search\nstring to represent, respectively, a single\nunspecified letter and multiple unspecified\nletters. The anagram search can be used to\nfind all words that can be made from a given\nstring of letters.\nThe horizontal menu bar at the bottom of the\ndictionary's display window provides access\nto a range of tools which can be accessed by\nmouse selection or by function keys.

First,\nthe title itself, coming from an author at an\ninstitute highly active in both traditional and\ninnovative design and delivery of distance\neducation, suggested an up-to-date book that\nwould reflect issues central to the field and\nalso the considerable work going on in\ndistance and open learning in Europe overall.\nThen, the author's introduction, giving an\noverview of different perspectives on open\nand distance learning, their shared as well as\ntheir distinct characteristics, was well written\nand conceptually helpful. I hoped the book\ncould become a useful resource.\nHowever, two warning signs soon arose. The\nfirst was the lack of an index or any kind of\noverview of the content, no indication of the\ndescriptors used for entries, and no sort of\nconceptual grouping of the entries. Only\nalphabetical order (and bold-faced terms\nwithin entries, for cross-referencing) were\nthere to guide me. The first term was access\ndevices followed by a page and a half of\ndiscussion with cross-indexed terms: content\nlists, summary, overview, objectives, index,\nglossary, headings, cross-references, advance\norganizers, pre-tests, and concept structure\ndiagram. Once I read the entry, I could see\nthe logic of calling these access devices, but\nI never would have thought to go to an entry\nentitled access devices if I had wished to find\nout more about key issues with, say, concept\nstructure diagrams being used in open\nlearning.\nThe second warning sign came when I then\ntried to look up, via alphabetical order,\nvarious key issues that appear frequently in\ndiscussions about distance and open learning,\nissues such as (among many) how to facili-\ntate co-operative work among learners at a\ndistance or how to design just-in-time open\nlearning and the implications of this kind of\nflexibility for traditional distance education.\nI could find nothing that seemed to relate to\nthese and a number of other key issues.\nPerhaps it was the lack of an index or\noverview that was preventing me from\nfinding what was in the book. I decided to\nread it from cover to cover, and coded the\ncontent. I found four major orientations that\ntogether left me disappointed and frustrated.\nMy general impressions, after my analysis,\nwere that (a) this book was most focused on\nthe design of highly structured print materi-\nals for distance delivery where the assump-\ntion was that learners would generally work\nin isolation; (b> the little of what I see and\nhear as key issues in open and distance\nlearning in Europe circa 1993 are not\nrepresented in this book; (c) most of the\nentries for communication and information\ntechnologies as tools and channels of dis-\ntance and open learning are unsatisfying; and\n(d) the book is unbalanced in its choice of\ntopics.\nThe first point is the most far-reaching. The\nbook appears to be written primarily from\nthe perspective of the designer of structured\nprint materials for distance delivery, where it\nis assumed that the designer, not the learner,\nis in essential control - that is, 'activities [...]\nare things you ask the learner to do ...' (p.\n19); 'an overview thus tells the learners\nwhere they have been, where they are now,\nand not only where they are going but why\nthey are going there' (p. 88); and so on.\nAlthough this approach is certainly relevant\n77\nReviews\nfor some learning situations, it reflects\nnothing of the major discussion now occur-\nring about constructivist approaches to\nlearning or learner control. Also, the book\nseems frequently to assume a model of the\nlearner working in isolation, generally only\nwith the print materials ('since learners\nusually have no one to turn to for clarifica-\ntion', p. 22). The awareness of the impor-\ntance of human interaction within the\ndistance and open-learning paradigm, and\nthe many strategies being used to include\ninteraction as a key part of the distance-\nlearning situation, does not seem to be a key\nissue relative to this book, while I think it is\none in practice and research.\nThe coverage of key terms and issues with\nrespect to the use of and impact of communi-\ncations and information technologies in\ndistance and open learning is particularly\nunsatisfying. Sometimes what is included is\nrather odd in its expression compared to\ngeneral practice. For example,\nteleconferencing is described in a two-line\nentry as 'a system for linking individuals to\ntelephones. Very useful for telephone tutori-\nals' (p. 118). Audio conferencing, for which\nthe above definition would be more accurate\nalthough still strange, and audiographic\nconferencing, have no entries at all, although\nthey are important channels for adding\ninteraction to distance learning in countries\nthroughout the world. Instead of audio\nconferencing or audiographic conferencing\nthere are two strange entries, audio letter and\naitdiovision, that describe techniques I have\nnot seen in current practice, nor certainly\nwould call key issues. Similarly, video\nconferencing does not merit an entry al-\nthough something called radiovision does.\nIn addition to somewhat odd definitions,\nothers relating to communication and\ninformation technologies seem not only out\nof date but uninformed. Computer drill and\npractice is described as 'seldom giving\nfeedback to learners who make mistakes'\n(p. 26). Computer-marked assignments are\nintroduced by saying: 'all that is needed is a\ntemplate that can be placed over a standard-\nized answer form to reveal whether the\nlearner's coded responses are in the right\nplace' (p. 28).\nIcons are described with an explanation that\nmakes little sense: 'they [...] can signal, at a\nglance, the necessity for having to hand your\naudio-cassette player or that you will be\nexpected to write something before the end\nof this particular section' (p. 59). Television\nis dismissed in 10 lines as an 'expensive\nmedium' (p. 119), despite its strategic and\nextensive use in distance education in many\ncountries, for example China and Turkey.\nAnd it is not only media-related terminology\nthat sometimes surprised me. How many\npeople would look up the terms reflective\naction guide, student stoppers or transform-\ners? Agro-botany evaluation is a highlighted\nterm - who is going to look for that as a key\nissue, especially when genuinely key issues\nsuch as criteria for cost-effectiveness evalua-\ntion are not mentioned? Without an index,\nhow will the reader know that people with\ndisabilities has been chosen as a heading?\nThe impression of imbalance I obtained\nrelated not only to content but also to\nimplicit frames of reference. While some key\nissues are represented minimally or not at\nall, others are over-represented. For example,\nentries relating to learner evaluation pre-\ndominate, with major headings that include:\nassessment, assignments, competence,\ncomputer-marked testing, evaluation,\nexaminations, formative evaluation, in-text\nquestions, marking, norm-referenced assess-\nment, objective tests, post-tests, pre-tests,\nself-assessment, and summative evaluation.\nMost of these are written in a introductory\nway, such as one would expect in a reader for\ngeneral pre-service teacher training.\nWith regard to frames of reference, those of\nmany actors in the overall distance and open-\nlearning setting are not represented at all.\nFor instance, key issues facing administrators\n78\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nin distance teaching organizations are not\nrepresented, neither are issues such as those\nrelating to broadening access while main-\ntaining quality or transferability of experi-\nence and accreditation, nor issues relating to\nthe training of instructors to support the\naddition of distance and open-learning\noptions to their teaching. Some specifically\nBritish references occur (for example,\nNational Vocational Qualifications), but no\nhint is given of the extensive experiences\nrelating to open and flexible learning that are\nhappening at the European or other interna-\ntional level, such as the DELTA Project, nor\nthe issues being discussed relative to those\nexperiences.\nOn reflection, if the book had been titled\ndifferently, clearly indicating its orientation,\nand if it had provided an index or overview,\nmy reaction would have been less negative.\nThe book could more accurately be de-\nscribed as 'An Introduction to the Design\nand Validation of (Predominately) Print\nMaterials for Structured Lesson Sequences\nOffered Via Distance Education Institutions'\nthan by its actual title. With this forewarn-\ning, I would have looked for different things\nand at a different level than the current title\nrequired of me. Then I could have appreci-\nated the detail about the construction of such\nprint materials. The three pages, for exam-\nple, under the heading in-text questions\ninclude very useful guidelines if one is not\nwaiting for key issues to emerge somewhere.\nThe discussions about learner characteristics\nand learner profiles are good, if one is not\nexpecting also to find something about key\nissues relating to group interaction at a\ndistance.\nIn summary, and in my opinion, the writing\nin this book about the instructional design\naspects of (predominately) print materials for\nstructured lessons delivered at a distance is\nclear and good and helpful. In contrast, again\nin my opinion, the overall coverage of key\nterms and issues in open and distance\nlearning is weak and unbalanced in selection.\nI would suggest an editing to take out the\ngenerally poor entries relating to media and\ncommunications and information technolo-\ngies, a revision of the title, the addition of an\nindex, and a re-presentation of the book as a\nreference text for print-materials design for\nstructured lessons delivered at a distance.\nThis latter topic is important, and the many\nentries related to it in this book are relevant\nand helpful.\nBetty Collis, University of Twente, The\nNetherlands\nRethinking University Teaching - a\nFramework for the Effective Use of\nEducational Technology by Diana\nLaurillard, London and New York,\nRoutledge, 1993. ISBN: 0-41509288-4\n(hardback), 0-41509289-2 (paperback).\nDiana Laurillard begins her book with an\naccount of her attendance at her very first\nlecture as a student, one which will ring\nfamiliar bells for many of us:\n'With 199 other students I counted myself\nlucky that I was in the main lecture theatre\nand not in the overspill room receiving\nclosed circuit television. The lecturer was\ntalking formulae as he came in, and for fifty\nminutes he scribbled them on the board as he\ntalked and we all scribbled more in a desper-\nate attempt to keep up with his dictation.'\nShe then goes on to recount what happened\nin the first lecture she herself gave as a\nteacher: more or less the same thing. But this\ntime, a student asked a question at the end of\nthe lecture which showed that nothing of it\nhad really been understood, either by that\nstudent or, it soon emerged, by any of the\nothers listening and scribbling furiously.\nLaurillard says that she learned a great deal\nmore from that lecture than did the students.\nThus she came to believe that university\nteachers must take the main responsibility\nfor what and how students learn. Now, given\nwhat I say in partial defence of the tradi-\n79\nReviews\ntional lecture in my editorial in this issue of\nALT-J, one might assume that I would not be\nin entire agreement with the further conclu-\nsions Laurillard comes to as a result of her\nearly experiences, in particular that the\nlecture form as generally practised in\nuniversities is a kind of insanity. 'It is truly a\nmiracle,' she insists, 'and a tribute to human\ningenuity that any student ever leams\nanything worthwhile in such a system.' But,\nthroughout this book, Laurillard talks a great\ndeal of sense about the failings of current\nacademic practice, and she and I are not as\nfar apart as it may at first appear even when\nit comes to the traditional lecture, which she\ntoo sees as a usable medium if well handled.\nLaurillard's main thesis is that the academic\nsystem must be made to change, and not by\nnew guidelines being issued on how to teach\nbut by universities reorganizing their teach-\ning infrastructure. Thus her book is essen-\ntially a discussion of how to think about\nteaching, and the final chapter, towards\nwhich the book steadily builds up, is an\nattempt to define the kind of infrastructure in\nwhich university teachers can be as efficient\nin their teaching as they try to be in their\nresearch. So well executed is this discussion,\nand so clear, consistent and convincing the\ndirection throughout, that I have absolutely\nno hesitation in recommending the book.\nSpace does not allow me to give the details\nof all the strands of argument which\nLaurillard weaves together with the utmost\nclarity and intelligence, and in plain but\nliterate English.\nBriefly, however, Part I consists of a lucid\ntreatment of what the aim of teaching should\nbe and of the complexity of the learning\nprocess, a study of student attitudes, and a\nclear-headed discussion of ways in which an\neffective teaching strategy can be created.\nPart II is an evaluation of the educational\ntools available to teachers, from print to\ninteractive media. It is a straightforward but\npenetrating evaluation - not surprisingly,\ngiven Laurillard's own respected work on\nevaluation - based on key research studies\nabout how students react to such tools and\nhow they use them. This is of very great\ninterest to those of us (which, of course,\nshould be all of us) who wish to be as sure as\nwe can be about which tools are best for\nwhich jobs.\nPart HI is concerned with design methodol-\nogy in educational technology. There is a\nwealth of literature - some good, some\nmediocre, some awful - on design issues in\nthis area. Laurillard talks (her usual) eminent\nsense about general design considerations,\nabout the ways in which design relates to\ncontent, about sensible approaches to\ncombining different media, and about what it\nmeans in practice to use educational technol-\nogy as an integral part of academic life.\nThis, then, is a work - the result of many\nyears of professional experience and active\ncampaigning for better teaching, and in\nparticular the effective use of educational\ntechnology - which puts into the clearest\npossible perspective the issues involved, and\ncogently argues for a rational approach to\nthem. Few readers of the book could fail to\nbe convinced that educational technology, if\nused wisely, is the right way forward for\nacademic institutions.\nIt is therefore a book which all those in-\nvolved in the use of educational technology,\nor those considering its use, should read. In\nfact, a copy of it should be sent to the vice-\nchancellor of every university with an\nexhortation to take some time to read it\ncarefully. Its ideas might then filter down to\nthose working at the coalface who are hardly\naware of the technological tools available for\nteaching, or who are as yet unconvinced of\ntheir value.\nGabriel Jacobs, University College of\nSwansea\n80\n"}
