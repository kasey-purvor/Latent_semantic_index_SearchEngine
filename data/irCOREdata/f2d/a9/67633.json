J. Ridley1 and E. A. Kihn2\nReceived 19 November 2003; revised 2 February 2004; accepted 4 March 2004; published 2 April 2004.\n[1] The polar cap index (PCI) has been shown to be quite\nuseful as an index of the electrodynamic processes within\nthe high-latitude ionosphere. Here we use between 150\nand 180 magnetometers to model the high-latitude\nelectrodynamics with the assimilative mapping of\nionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) technique for all of\n1997\u20132001. We compare AMIE calculations of the cross\npolar cap potential (CPCP), polar cap electric field, and\npolar cap area to the Northern PCI and the existing PCI-\nbased relationships for these quantities. We find that the\nexisting PCI estimates underestimate all of the AMIE\nderived quantities. The PCI is best correlated with the\nCPCP, while it correlates least with the polar cap electric\nfield. In addition, there is a seasonal effect in the\nrelationship between all AMIE quantities and the PCI. It\nis most pronounced in the electric field. The polar cap area\nis shown to have a linear fit in the summer and an\nasymptotic fit in the winter. These differences indicate that\nthere may be a conductance difference in the techniques. We\nderive new relationships between the Northern PCI and the\nAMIE derived polar cap area, CPCP, and polar cap electric\nfield which include the seasonal dependence.

Introduction\n[2] There are a number of global indices that are used to\nindicate the state of the magnetosphere at any given time.\nFor example, the auroral electrojet index is meant to\ndescribe the maximum amount of auroral activity occurring\n(or maximum westward current flowing) within a certain\nmagnetic latitude band. The Dst index indicates the strength\nof the magnetospheric ring current (plus some addition of\nmagnetopause and cross-tail currents). The polar cap index\n(PCI) indicates the amount of energy which the solar wind\nand interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) are transferring to\nthe magnetosphere through direct driving (i.e., merging)\n[Troshichev et al., 1988, 1996b]. The polar cap index is\nderived from a single station per hemisphere. There are\ntherefore 2 independent polar cap indices - one derived from\nthe Thule magnetometer (Northern) and one from the\nVostok magnetometer (Southern). The PCI is continuous\nfrom the present day back to 1975. Recently, it has been\nshown that the Northern and Southern polar cap indices can\ndiffer systematically [Lukianova et al., 2002]. All calcula-\ntions within this study are conducted using the Northern\nPCI computed by the Danish Meteorological Institute\n(DMI).\n[3] The assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrody-\nnamics (AMIE) technique [Richmond and Kamide, 1988]\nhas been used in a number of studies to relate the high-\nlatitude ionospheric electrodynamics to the IMF. AMIE is a\ndifficult technique to use because of the large amount of\ndata needed to create a coherent and accurate solution. In\naddition, the data is distributed among many providers and\nthe quality is quite variable. Therefore, creating proxies of\nthe electrodynamics parameters that can be computed from\nAMIE can be quite useful. For example, Chun et al. [1999]\ncalculated a relationship between the PCI and AMIE de-\nrived hemispheric integrated Joule heating.\n[4] Troshichev et al. [1996a] relates the PCI to CPCP and\nthe radius of the polar cap in the morning and evening\nsectors. These relationships were determined from 6 months\n(January\u2013June 1990) of Akebono satellite data, composed\nof 325 orbits. Troshichev et al. [2000] relate the PCI to the\n\u2018\u2018near-pole\u2019\u2019 electric field. This was done using 450 polar\npasses of DMSP during days that included low and high\nactivity. They related the PCI to the electric field (in mV\/m)\nnear the magnetic pole, and determined the following\nrelationship:\nE \u00bc \u00020:29PCI2 \u00fe 7:65PCI \u00fe 15:3 \u00f01\u00de\nfor the Northern PCI. This is equation (2) from Troshichev\net al. [2000] multiplied by 1.7, as specified in the paper,\nassuming an ionospheric altitude of 110 km, as AMIE does.\n2. Technique\n[5] The AMIE technique was run for every minute of\n1997\u20132001 for both Northern and Southern hemispheres\nusing between 150\u2013180 magnetometers spaced nonuni-\nformly across the Earth. For this study, we concentrate on\nthe Northern hemisphere, which included the vast major-\nity of the magnetometers. 2.6 million calculations of the\nhigh-latitude electrodynamics, including the potential,\nelectric field, conductances, auroral precipitation, and\nhorizontal and field-aligned currents were done. From\nthis database, the CPCP, maximum polar cap electric\nfield magnitude (i.e., largest electric field poleward of\n80\u0001), and the polar cap area were extracted. The polar cap\narea was calculated from the auroral precipitation results\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 31, L07801, doi:10.1029\/2003GL019113, 2004\n1Center for Space Environment Research, University of Michigan, Ann\nArbor, Michigan, USA.\n2National Geophysical Data Center, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/04\/2003GL019113$05.00\nL07801 1 of 5\nin a similar manner as done in Baker et al. [2000]: the\nlocation of the maximum total electron energy flux was\ndetermined at each MLT (i.e., 24 wedges); then move\ntowards the pole until the precipitation flux has fallen\nbelow 25% of the maximum value; then calculate the\narea poleward of this location. The 25% cut-off was\nfound by Baker et al. [2000] to be very effective in\nfinding the open\/closed field-line boundary using total\nelectron precipitation energy flux derived from POLAR\nimages of the aurora. Kihn and Ridley (E. Kihn and\nA. Ridley, A statistical analysis of the AMIE auroral\nspecification, submitted to Journal of Geophysical\nResearch, 2004) have shown that, statistically, AMIE puts\nthe location of the peak of the auroral oval within 1 grid\ncell (i.e., 2\u0001) of satellite observations of the peak. This\nimplies that AMIE can reproduce the location of the oval\nrelatively well.\n[6] AMIE includes both solar and auroral driven conduc-\ntance background models. The solar conductance is speci-\nfied by a solar zenith angle and was developed using data\nfrom Chatanika radar. For different solar zenith angles (z),\nthe conductance is:\nSH \u00bc 1:8 cos z\u00f0 \u00deF1=210:7 z < 65\u0006 \u00f02\u00de\nSH \u00bc SH 65\u0006\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 0:27 z\u0002 65\u0006\u00f0 \u00de z > 65\u0006 \u00f03\u00de\nSP \u00bc 0:5 cos z2=3\n\u0001 \u0002\nF\n2=3\n10:7 z < 65\n\u0006 \u00f04\u00de\nSP \u00bc SP 65\u0006\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 0:24 z\u0002 65\u0006\u00f0 \u00de z > 65\u0006 \u00f05\u00de\nSP \u00bc SP 100\u0006\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 0:13 z\u0002 100\u0006\u00f0 \u00de z > 100\u0006 \u00f06\u00de\nwhere SH and SP are the Hall and Pedersen conductance,\nrespectively, and F10.7 is the solar radio flux. SH (SP) is\nlimited to a minimum value of 0.8 (0.4) mho. The\nconductance is then modified according to the local\nmagnetic field, as described by Rasmussen et al. [1988]\nand Figure 9 in Kamide and Matsushita [1979].\n[7] AMIE modifies the conductances using the formula-\ntion given by Ahn et al. [1998], which relates the ground-\nbased magnetic perturbations to the conductance and\nelectron precipitation. At each magnetometer location, the\nmagnetic perturbation is converted to a Hall and Pedersen\nconductance. The solar conductance is subtracted from this\n(if the station is on the day-side). The Robinson et al. [1987]\nformulation is then used to convert the conductances (at\neach station) to total and average electron precipitation.\nThese individual data sources are then used to derive a\nparticle precipitation pattern (used to calculate the polar cap\narea). The Robinson et al. [1987] formulation is used once\nagain to derive auroral driven Hall and Pedersen conduc-\ntances. These are added to the solar conductances to derive\ntotal conductances. The Fuller-Rowell and Evans [1987]\n(particles) and Weimer [1996] (potentials) models were used\nas background patterns for all runs.\n[8] The cross polar cap potential and electric field were\ncalculated from the PCI on a 15 minute time-scale, using\nequations (3) and (4). Troshichev et al. [1996a] provided the\ndawn and dusk radius of the polar cap. A more physically\nmeaningful quantity is the area of the polar cap, since it\nindicates the total amount of magnetic flux (and therefore\nenergy) in the lobes. We can therefore calculate the area\nfrom the dawn and dusk radii:\nAPC \u00bc p 1\n4\nR2am \u00fe\n1\n4\nR2pm \u00fe\n1\n2\nRam \u00fe Rpm\n2\n\u0003 \u00042\" #\n\u00f07\u00de\nwhere APC is the area of the polar cap, and Ram and Rpm are\nradius of the polar cap in the dawn and dusk sectors (as\ndefined by Troshichev et al. [1996a]), but converted to\nmeters. The above formula assumes 4 wedges with the\nfollowing radii: (1) Ram, (2) Rpm, and (3) two with (Ram +\nRpm)\/2. The AMIE CPCP, area, and electric field were\naveraged over 15 minutes to match the time of the PCI\ncomputed values.\n3. Results\n[9] Figure 1 shows comparisons between the PCI and\nAMIE computed potential, polar cap area, and electric\nfield for January, 1999. The solid lines on each plot\nindicate the relationships in Troshichev et al. [1996a,\n2000]. These lines follow the general trends observed in\nthe AMIE results, but there are some systematic differ-\nences. For example, the relationship under-predicts the\nFigure 1. The PCI versus the AMIE derived CPCP, Apc,\nand Epc (from top to bottom) for Jan., 1999. The solid lines\nare the relationships in Troshichev et al. [1996a, 2000],\nwhile the dashed lines are fits which are described here. The\ncorrelation coefficient (CC) reported is between the AMIE\nderived quantities and the PCI. The errors (err) are the root-\nmean squared differences between the predicted PCI-based\nquantities and the AMIE derived quantities.\nL07801 RIDLEY AND KIHN: PCI COMPARISONS WITH AMIE L07801\n2 of 5\npolar cap electric fields for almost all PCI values. The\nformulation also under-predicts both the CPCP and polar\ncap area at low values of PCI, while doing quite well at\nhigh values of PCI. Another issue is that the Troshichev\net al. [2000] formulation of the CPCP becomes negative\nat around PCI = \u00020.5, which is unphysical. Finally, the\nPCI predicted polar cap area starts to decrease at around\nPCI = 9, which is not typically observed.\n[10] For these reasons, new fits were calculated for the\nthree quantities. The dashed line shows the new fits. For the\nCPCP and the polar cap electric field, linear relationships\nwere determined, while an exponential fit to the polar cap\narea worked best. The following relationships were deter-\nmined for January 1999:\nF \u00bc 27:12\u00fe 15:5PCI \u00f08\u00de\nAPC \u00bc 22:93\u0002 13:13e\u00020:19PCI \u00f09\u00de\nEPC \u00bc 29:69\u00fe 5:79PCI : \u00f010\u00de\n[11] Figure 2 shows the relationship between the PCI\nindex and the AMIE derived quantities for June, 1998.\nThere are some differences between this and the January\n1999 time period. For example, the PCI index is much more\nconfined below 4, while the AMIE electric field and CPCP\ncontain a similar range of values as the January 1999 period.\nBecause of this, the cross correlation coefficients are all\nreduced. The fits for June, 1998 are:\nF \u00bc 38:20\u00fe 16:22PCI \u00f011\u00de\nAPC \u00bc 59:85\u0002 50:98e\u00020:04PCI \u00f012\u00de\nEPC \u00bc 48:52\u00fe 5:20PCI : \u00f013\u00de\nOne of the largest differences is in the exponential fit to\nthe area. The asymptotic limit of the area is almost 60 \u0007\n1012 m, which is over a factor of 2 larger than the\nasymptotic limit for January 1999. Complementary with\nthat is the e-folding factor, which is 5 times smaller than the\nJanuary 1999 factor. These two combined imply that the\narea during June 1998 is approximately linearly related to\nthe PCI, while the area during January 1999 is exponentially\nrelated to the PCI. During June 1998, both the electric field\nand potential have larger y-intercepts (but smaller slopes)\nthan during January 1999, implying that for lower polar cap\nindices, the electric field and potential will be larger in June\nthan in January; and for large PCI, the values will be similar\nor smaller in June than in January.\n[12] Because there is such a large difference between a\nsummer and a winter period, we examine the correlation\nand fit coefficients as a function of the month of the year.\nFigure 3a shows the trend in the relationship between the\nAMIE derived CPCP and the PCI. In the top plot, there is a\ntrend for the correlation coefficient to peak in the winter\nmonths and reach minimal values in the summer months.\nWhen a sin function is fit through these values, the peak to\nFigure 2.

(c) The top plot is the monthly AMIE Apc vs. PCI CC, while the middle and bottom plots show the\nasymptotic limit of the area (i.e., PCI = 1) and the baseline area (i.e., PCI = 0).\nL07801 RIDLEY AND KIHN: PCI COMPARISONS WITH AMIE L07801\n3 of 5\npeak differences is 14% of the mean value, which is\nrelatively small. A similar trend is observed in the intercept\nbetween the PCI and the CPCP, with a minimum during the\nwinter months and a maximum during the summer. The\npeak to peak deviation is about 23%. The slope shows some\nindication of a seasonal variation, but the year to year\nvariation in the mean is more significant. One may conclude\nthat the CPCP may be related to the AMIE derived CPCP\nwith a seasonally dependent y-intercept:\nF \u00bc 29:28\u0002 3:31 sin T \u00fe 1:49\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 17:81PCI ; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere T is the month of the year normalized to 2p (i.e.,\nJan. = 0, July = 6 * 2 * p\/12 = p, Dec. = 11 * 2 * p\/12). This\nformula can be used in general for a relationship between\nthe Northern PCI and the ionospheric CPCP.\n[13] Figure 3b shows the fit and correlation coefficients\nfor each month from 1997 through 2001 for the AMIE\nderived polar cap electric field. Each of these show a\nseasonal variation, such that the electric field can be related\nto the PCI through the relationship:\nEPC \u00bc 34:87\u0002 5:67 sin T \u00fe 3:21\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00fe 6:58\u00fe 2:04 sin T \u00fe 2:03\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \nPCI : \u00f015\u00de\nThe peak to peak variation in the slope is 62%, which is\ncaused by the lack of correlation between the PCI and the\nelectric field during the summer months. The y-intercept\nvaries by 32.5% during the year, which is to compensate for\nthe lack of slope in the summer months.\n[14] Figure 3c shows the monthly relationships for the\narea with the PCI. Since the fits are with an exponential, the\nsecond and third plots are different than Figures 3a and 3b.\nThese two plots show the asymptotic limit of the area (i.e.,\nPCI =1, or the first numbers in equations (9) and (13)) and\nthe baseline area (i.e., PCI = 0, or the first+second number\nin equations (9) and (13). There are few variations in the\nbaseline area with no seasonal dependence being observed.\nThe asymptotic value, on the other hand, varies significantly\n(as does the exponent, which is not shown). The strong\nvariation in the exponent and asymptotic value indicates\nthat the fit is switching between a linear and non-linear\nrelationship for summer and winter, respectively. This is\nseen when the plots in Figure 1 are compared - the fit in\nJanuary is an exponential, while the fit in June is linear over\nthe entire range of PCI values. The relationship between the\npolar cap area and the PCI can be described as:\nAPC \u00bc 29:72\u0002 21:11eb \u00fe 12:73 sin T \u0002 1:08\u00f0 \u00de 1\u0002 eb\n\u0007 \b \u00f016\u00de\nwhere b = (\u00020.24 + 0.16sin(T \u0002 1.08))PCI.\n4. Summary and Conclusions\n[15] We have run the AMIE technique for all of 1997\nthrough 2001 using 150\u2013180 ground-based magnetometers\non a 1 minute cadence. The results of the cross polar cap\npotential, polar cap electric field, and polar cap area were\ndetermined. This study presents a comparison between the\nAMIE results and the polar cap index. We find that the\ncurrent formulation which relates the CPCP, E-field, and\narea to the PCI to be lacking in a number of regards, but\nadequate in some circumstances. Because of the limitations,\nwe rederive the relationships.\n[16] When the newly derived relationships are examined\non a month by month basis, a clear seasonal dependence is\nobserved. This dependence is quite strong in the relationship\nbetween the polar cap electric field and the PCI. It exists in\nthe relationship between the CPCP, but is muchweaker. In the\nrelationship between the PCI and the polar cap area, the\nseasonal dependence is on whether the relationship is linear\nor exponential, while the base area (i.e., when PCI = 0) shows\nno sign of a seasonal dependence.\n[17] Both the AMIE and the PCI take the season into\naccount, but the seasonal dependence between the two\nshows that they are not consistent with each other. As\ndescribed above, AMIE takes the solar driven conductance\ninto account. Different solar driven conductance models\ncould be used in AMIE to determine the effects.\n[18] The study by Lukianova et al. [2002] shows that\nthere is a seasonal dependence between the Northern\n(provided by DMI) and Southern PCI when the PCI is\nlarge. They also show that the Northern PCI is typically\nweaker than the Southern PCI, which matches our assess-\nment that the PCI formulations given by Troshichev et al.\n[1996a, 2000] predict values that are too low.\n[19] It would be of further use to correlate the PCI and\nAMIE derived values for many years with a conductance\nindependent source, such as the SuperDARN or incoherent\nscatter radar networks, or DMSP satellites. Any seasonal\nvariation observed between AMIE or PCI and a conduc-\ntance independent source could be corrected by improving\nthe solar conductance model within AMIE or the method for\ncomputing PCI.\n[20] Acknowledgments.
