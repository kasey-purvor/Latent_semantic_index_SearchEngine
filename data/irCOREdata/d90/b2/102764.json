INTRODUCTION\nStatic (fixed) spectrum allocation permanently\nassigns a segment of the radio frequency spectrum\nto a radio access networks (RAN). Static spectrum\nallocation can be very inefficient, in the presence\nof bandwidth demands that vary highly along the\nspace dimension (from region to region) and\/or\nalong the time dimension (from hour to hour).\nDynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) seeks to ex-\nploit the variations in the loads of various RAN's\nto allocate the spectrum efficiently. Reference [1]\ndiscusses two DSA schemes that have been re-\ncently studied. Important differences between [1]\nand the present work include: (i) our emphasis\non a pricing-driven solution, as well as our con-\nsideration of (ii) data-transmitting terminals over\nCDMA, (iii) physical layer issues, (iv) the value\nof the service to a user (\"willingness to pay\").\nIn the present work, a \"spectrum manager\" im-\nplements DSA by auctioning short-term spectrum\nlicenses. Just before the start of a DSA period, a\nnetwork operator bids for spectrum, on the basis\nof the current state of its network. But all the\nawarded spectrum licenses simultaneously expire\nat the end of a specified short period, after which\nthe allocation process is repeated. It is clear that a\ngovernment agency could become the \"spectrum\nmanager\". But there is another less obvious possi-\nbility: Spectrum owners in a given locality could\ncreate a \"spectrum managing firm\". They could\ntransfer their spectrum rights to the managing\nfirm, while maintaining ownership of this firm.\nAnd they may instruct the managing firm to use\neconomic tools to allocate short-term spectrum\nrights to the original spectrum owners themselves,\n(and, possibly, to new communication firms that\nthey may approve). Of course, the managing firm's\nprofits will eventually be distributed among its\nowners (the original spectrum owners).\nImplementing DSA via short-term spectrum li-\ncenses raises some important issues. First, what\nshould be the \"guiding principle\" of the spectrum\nmanager : revenue-maximisation, fairness, overall\nefficiency, etc.? Second, which market \"mecha-\nnism\" should be used : linear pricing, nonlinear\npricing, auctions, etc.? Auctions seem a natural\nchoice, but many formats are available, and the\nbest choice is not obvious. Herein we assume that\nan auction format has been already agreed upon,\nsuch that it is optimal for each selfish participant\nto submit a bid that equals its true valuation\nof the \"object\". One such format is the multi-\nunit version of the auction proposed by [2]. In\nthe original \"second price\" or Vickrey auction,\n\"sealed bids\" are submitted for an object. The\nhighest bidder wins, but pays an amount that\nequals the highest losing bid. In practise, special\nprovisions must be made to avoid certain types of\nmalicious behaviour in this or any auction format.\nWe do not discuss such measures, but refer the\ninterested reader to a relevant discussion in [3].\nWe focus on the problem of the operator of a\nCDMA cell, populated by delay-tolerant terminals\noperating at various data rates, on the down-\nlink. Given the current status of the network, the\n978-3-8007-2909-8\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE 1 850\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

But the operator's revenues depend on its\nown internal pricing policies. Thus, optimal end-\nuser prices must be found together with a bidding\nstrategy. In [41, a parallel strand of work, we\nprovide optimal pricing results, for a similar but\nsimpler situation in which the spectrum manager\ndirectly sells short-term licenses at a unit price (no\nauctions are used).\nThere are several works that apply Vickrey-\nlike schemes in a communication context. For\ninstance, [5] makes a similar proposal for band-\nwidth allocation in a wired network (which [6]\nlater applies to CDMA power control). But [5]\nassumes that each bidder can choose \"bands\"\nof an arbitrary widths, which complicates imple-\nmentation and analysis. Also of interest are [7],\nwhich explores pricing issues in the downlink of\na CDMA cell, and [8], which studies capacity and\npricing optimisation for a communication resource\nsubject to congestion.\nII. MULTI-UNIT VICKREY AUCTION\nThe multi-unit second-price (Vickrey) auction\nwhen applied to spectrum allocation works as\nfollows. The available spectrum is divided into K\nbands, each of width w. We assume that an oper-\nator cares about how many but not which bands\nhe is assigned (all bands are equally good for\nthe considered radio access technologies). Each\noperator submits a bid vector with K components.\nThe first component means how much the bidder\noffers to pay for the first band assigned to him\n(whichever it is). The kth component means how\nmuch he offers to pay for an additioncal band if\nk - 1 bands have already been assigned to him.\nThe spectrum manager receives all the bid vectors\nand assigns the bands as follows: first, the top\noverall bid (by looking at the components of all\nbid vectors) gets one band, the second highest bid\nwins the next band, and so on, until the K bands\nhave been assigned. Notice that the overall highest\nand the second highest bids could be components\nof the same vector. Thus, the first several bands\n(possibly all) could go to the same bidder. A\ncritical detail is that what a winner pays for a band\ndepends on the losing bids of the opponents. For\nthe first won band, a bidder will pay the highest\nlosing bid submitted by the other bidders; for the\nnext won band, he will pay the second-highest\nlosing bid (excluding his own), and so on. Thus,\na bidder that has won k bands, will pay the sum\nof the k highest losing bids submitted by the other\nbidders. (Ties are broken at random).\nFor example, let K = 3. A bid (bl, b1, b3)\nmeans: I offer to pay bi if I end tip with a total of\none band allocated to me (I don't care which one),\nI offer bI + b2 for a total of two bands, and I offer\nb1 + b2 + b3 for all 3 bands. Suppose that only\ntwo bid vectors are submitted: bl= (5, 3,2) and\nb2=(4.5,4,l). The assignment goes as follows: one\nof the bands goes to bidder 1 (5 is top overall bid),\nthe next band goes to bidder 2 (second highest bid\nis 4.5), the last band also goes to bidder 2 (the\nthird highest bid is 4, the second component of\nb2). Since bidder 1 won only one band, he will\npay the highest losing bid submitted by bidder\n2, which was 1. Bidder 2 won two bands, and\nwill pay the sum of the two highest losing bids\nsubmitted by bidder 1, that is, 3+2=5. Thus, the\nauctioneer will get a total of 6.\nIII. THE MOTIVES OF OPERATORS AND\nEND-USERS\nA. Optimisation problem of a network operator\nThe main question the operator must answer is\nhow much to bid for spectrum at a given DSA pe-\nriod. At the moment of bidding, the operator will\nknow the number and characteristics of the termi-\nnals operating in its network, including the details\nof the physical communication layer (modulation,\nerror-control coding, mode of diversity, etc). A\ndistinguishing feature of the chosen auction for-\nmat is that the bidder \"best response\" is to bid\nhis \"true valuation\" of the object being auctioned.\nIn our specific case, \"truthful bidding\" means\nthat the first component of a bid vector should\nequal the maximum revenues that the operator\ncould obtain if he gets a single band of spectrum\n(and nothing else). The second component should\nequal the extra revenue he would get if instead\nof only one band, he gets a total of two, etc.\nBut the operator's revenues also depend on his\nown pricing policies. Thus, the operator must\ndetermine his own (internal) pricing policy along\nwith the bid.\nIn determining an operator's end-user pric-\ning, we neglect the competition among opera-\ntors. The monopoly analysis provides some useful\n\"bounds\": it is the \"best case scenario\" for the op-\nerator, and the \"worst case scenario\" for the end-\nuser. Additionally, this analysis may be a useful\napproximation of the situation often observed in\npractise, in which relatively few operators domi-\nnate a given region.\nB. Behaviour of the terminals\nWe must specify the behaviour of a data ter-\nminal that can choose resources, in the presence\nof pricing. We focus strictly on the downlink of\n978-3-8007-2909-8\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE 1851\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Reference [9] provides the\nbasic physical model.\nWe assume a QoS index of the form\n-Bi+\u00b1i\nwhere (i) P3i is the monetary value to the terminal\nof one information bit successfully transferred\n(a constant for a given terminal), (ii) Bi is the\n(average) number of information bits the terminal\nhas successfully transferred within a fixed length\nof time, say t, and (iii) yi is the amount of money\nthe terminal has left after any charges and rewards\nare computed. This model is grounded on the\nmicro-economic concepts of quasi-linear utility\nfunction, and partial-equilibrium analysis [10, Ch.\n10].\nBi will generally depend on some physical\nindex of quality of service (QoS), xi (to be spec-\nified further below). When the terminal must pay\nci(x) for QoS level xi, it chooses xi to maximise\nI3iBi(xi) + [Di -c(xi)]. I3Bi(xi) is the \"value\" to\nthe terminal of the bits it gets to transfer over\nthe reference period (the terminal's \"benefit\"), and\nDi is the terminal's monetary budget. Di is just a\nconstant for a given terminal, which limits its total\nexpenditure. If Di is relatively \"large\", it needs not\nbe considered. Thus, the terminal chooses QoS to\nmaximise benefits minus cost: riBi (xi) -ci (xi).\nIV. PHYSICAL MODEL\nBefore proceeding with the analysis, we specify\nin greater detail the physical model.\n1) N is the number of terminals receiving data\nsimultaneously from a CDMA base station\n(BS) (downlink operation). The BS has a\ntotal downlink power constraint of P.\n2) Ri bps is the data rate of terminal i\n3) RC cps is the chip rate of the channel, com-\nmon to all terminals. For convenience, we\nset RC = W, where W is the total bandwidth\n(spectrum) allocated to the cell.\n4) G1 = W\/R1 is the spreading (processing)\ngain of terminal i.\n5) Information is sent in M-bit packets carrying\nL < M information bits.\n6) fs(xi) is the frame-success function (FSF)\ngiving the probability of correct reception\nof a data packet as a function of the signal-\nto-interference ratio (SIR) at the receiver.\nBelow, f(x) : =fs(x) - fs(O) replaces fs(x)\nto avoid certain technical problems [9]. As\nan example, for non-coherent FSK mod-\nulation, with packet size M=80, indepen-\ndent bit errors, no forward error correction,\nand perfect error detection, FSF is fs(x) -\n[1 1- exp (X ')]. However, we stress that\nour analysis does not rely on this or any\nspecific FSF. We assume that all we know\nC\n... ..-.\nFig. 1. From [4]. pricing for revenue maximisation.\nabout the physical layer is that the FSF\nhas the \"S\" shape shown in figure 1. The\ntechnical characterisation of an \"S-curve\"\nand some useful results are given in [11].\n7) Following [7] we assume that in the down-\nlink, the CDMA signatures retain their or-\nthogonality, and effectively eliminate intra-\ncell interference (or that it is included as\npart of the random noise). Thus, the received\nSIR is obtained as xi = GihiPil\/& with Pi the\ndownlink power, hi the path gain, and &2 the\naverage noise power at the receiver.\n8) Packets received in error which cannot be\ncorrected result in ideal re-transmissions un-\ntil correctly received and confirmed.\nA relatively simple analysis similar to that in\n[9] tells us that, on the average, the number\nof information bits successfully transferred by a\nterminal over the time interval X is:\nBi(xi) = t(L\/M)Rif(xi) (1)\nV. OPTIMAL SIR AND OPTIMAL PRICE\nIn order to determine his bid, the operator must\nfind the maximal amount of revenues that he\ncan obtain from the various possible amounts of\nspectrum he may win. Below, we focus on a single\nband of width w, and later generalise. It is natural\nfor the operator to charge each terminal per unit\nof allocated downlink power (we consider only\nlinear pricing). However, a price per power can\nbe easily converted to a price per received SIR\ncixi. To see this, suppose that the terminal must\npay c per downlink Watt. Since the received SIR\nis obtained as xi = GihiPi\/l&, in order to enjoy\nan SIR of xi, the terminal must order (a2\/Gihi)xi\nWatts of downlink power, for which it must pay\n(G2\/Gihi)exi. This payment can be written as cix\nwith ci:- (6\/Gihi)8.\n978-3-8007-2909-8\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE\n-%\ns\n'9\n1852\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on July 14,2010 at 11:42:22 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n2005 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications\nThe terminal chooses its received SIR xi to\nmaximise benefits minus cost: 3iBi(xi) - cixi, with\nBi given by eq. 1. fiBi(x,) is just a multiple of\nthe FSF and inherits its S-shape. Thus, we must\ninvestigate how to maximise an expression of the\nform S(x) - cx, where S is some S-curve. Once the\noperator knows the terminal's best response to a\nvalue of c, he can choose c to maximise revenues.\nWe perform this analysis in detail in [4], whose\nmain results we summarise below.\nFirst, let us think that only one terminal is\nactive. Figure 1 illustrates the solution procedure.\nFirst, if the line cx lies entirely above S, except at\nthe origin, the terminal should decline to operate,\nsince its cost would exceed its benefit for any\npositive x. The largest value of c acceptable to the\nterminal is c*, obtained as the slope of the unique\ntangent line of S that goes through the origin.\nFor c < c*, the maximising choice is the largest\nx at which the derivative of the S-curve equals c\nThus, for a given power price Ck the terminal\nwill find the matching SIR price ck = (\u00a2T\/Gih)c,\nand will not operate if Ck > c*. Otherwise it will\nchoose an SIR (QoS level) xk satisfying S'(xk) =\nCk (e.g., in fig. 1 T1, the tangent of S at xl,\nis parallel to clx). Then, the resulting operator's\nrevenue is CkXk XkS (Xk).\nAs shown by figure 1, the graph xS'(x) (rev-\nenues) has a single-peak at xR, and crosses S(x)\nat a unique positive value, x*, precisely the point at\nwhich the tangent c*x meets S. With the constraint\nc < c*, the curve xS'(x) (revenues) is maximised\nat x - x* corresponding to c = c* resulting in\noperator's revenues of c*x* _ x*S'(x*) - S(x*).\nAs long as the operator can charge an individual\nprice to each terminal, the single-terminal analysis\ngeneralises easily. The operator will choose for\nterminal j a price for downlink power, such that\nits SIR price is c*, the slope of the only tangent\nto Sj that goes through the origin. Since the\nterminals share an identical FSF, f, then each Sj\nis a multiple of the common f. It is easy to see\nand prove that replacing Sj with a multiple of Sj\nwill change c). but will have no effect on the value\nof x;. Thus, the terminals will choose an identical\nSIR x*.\nVI. SERVICE PRIORITY AND BIDDING\nA. Power constraint\nSection V tells us that as long as the terminals\nhave a common FSF, each terminal will end up\noperating at the SIR x* (but each paying an\nindividual price c* for that SIR). With bandwidth\nw, the necessary downlink power is obtained as:\nw hiPi G* * 2x* Ri\nR 7 =X=> Pi = h\nThe power constraint N1 P* < P can be writ-\nten as:\n(3)\nWe can think of w as the \"effective bandwidth\",\nwhich is the original amount amplified by the\nthe available \"rise over thermal\" (ROT) per unit\nof required SIR, with ROT defined as P\/&2.\nLikewise, the ratio Ri\/hi can be thought of as\nthe amount of \"effective\" bandwidth consumed by\nterminal i.\nB. Service priority: revenue per Hertz\nConstraint 3 may not be satisfied with band-\nwidth w. Thus, the operator needs a \"service\npriority\". Such policy is obtained by comparing\nthe revenues provided by a terminal (if served)\nto the amount of resources it consumes. Terminal\ni, if served, will contribute revenues of Si(x*)\nt(L\/M)f(x*)iiRi:= tfiRi . We can think of t\nt(L\/M)f(x*) as the \"net\" or \"effective\" time of\noperation, and fiRi as the revenues from i per\n(effective) time unit (we can choose the time scale\nso that t - 1). By dividing iRi by Ri\/hi we\nobtain terminal i's contribution to revenues per\nunit of (effective) bandwidth: 3ihi. Now, with the\nterminals' labels such that 13hl > ... > INhN,\nour service criterion is simple and clear: serve\nterminals 1 through P1, with 1J the largest index\nsuch that,\nI Ri<\ni-l hi- (4)\nC. Bidding\nThe preceding subsection tells us immediately\nwhat the operator should offer for a single band\n(the first component of the bid vector), namely\n1i-liR for a convenient time scale. To know\nhow much to bid for an additional band, the key\nis to determine the additional terminals that can be\nserved, which would tell us the additional revenue\nbrought by the band. Assuming that the chip\nrate can be adjusted to match a larger bandwidth\n(this is not strictly necessary), we can multiply\nthe right-hand side of constraint 4 by two, and\nobtain 17 as the largest index that can satisfy\nthe new constraint, meaning that terminals I* + 1\nthrough 14 could now be served. Likewise, we can\ndetermine that terminals 1* + I through 13 could\nadditionally be served with a third band, and so\non. Then, the jth component of the bid has the\nsimple form (with Io := 0)\n(2)\nI\nX PiRi\ni=1 1+l\n(5)\n978-3-8007-2909-8\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE\nN Ri.< p\/02 w:= iT.Y, hi x*i=l\n1853\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

For example, with 3 total bands and\n6 active terminals, a bid vector may look like\n[3IR1 + f2R2 + P3R3 P4R4 + f5R5 16R6 ]\nVII. DISCUSSION\nWe have solved the problem of a CDMA op-\nerator participating in a dynamic spectrum al-\nlocation (DSA) scheme, in which a \"spectrum\nmanager\" periodically auctions short-term spec-\ntrum licenses. Delay-tolerant terminals operate at\ndissimilar data rates in the downlink of a CDMA\ncell, and each user has a distinct \"willingness to\npay\", Pi (the most he would pay for a successfully\ntransferred information bit). We have described a\nrealistic business model which could support our\nscheme.\nWith conveniently chosen units, our analytical\nresults acquire crisp form. The interests of oper-\nator and end users meet at a specific operating\npoint: the SIR value x*, which is easily found\nby drawing a tangent to the graph of the frame-\nsuccess rate function (FSF). At the optimum, a\nserved terminal's contribution to revenues is 3iRi\n(with R, its data rate), the amount of \"effective\nspectrum\" it consumes is Ri\/hi (with hi its path\ngain), and its service priority is ihi (\"revenue\nper Hertz\"). The operator's optimal bid for a (an\nadditional) band of spectrum, takes the simple\nform 3iRR with the sum covering the (additional)\nterminals that can be served, if the band is won.\nWe assume that all we know about the phys-\nical layer is that its FSF is some S-curve. This\nmakes our analysis relevant to a wide variety of\npractical configurations, and allows us to perform\nlink layer adjustments for revenue maximisation.\nFor instance, if modulation schemes A & B are\navailable, each produces its own FSF. For each S-\ncurve, we can determine the corresponding oper-\nating point (xn*Jm(xn4)), by drawing the tangent\nmentioned above. For a given bandwidth, other\nthings being equal, the revenue provided by any\nserved terminal is directly proportional to f01(x1),\nand the number of terminals that can be served is\ndecreasing in x,4, (see constraint 3). Thus, if xA <\nXB and fA(xA) > fB(xM ) the modulation scheme A\nshould always be chosen. Otherwise the operator\nwill alternate between A and B depending on the\nspecific values of Pi, Ri and hi, determined by who\nis active and where.\nSome of the additional functionality necessi-\ntated by DSA is discussed in [1]. In particular,\nwe would like the CDMA network to adjust its\nchip rate to match available bandwidth. But we\ncan also apply our scheme with an inflexible chip\nrate, if it matches the basic spectrum bands being\nauctioned. While current networks and standards\ndo not support DSA, the needed functionality\nseems well within reach, given the steady advance\nof technology. Before any network upgrade, a\ncost-benefit analysis should be performed. With\nour results, we can perform auction-driven DSA\namong CDMA operators. But this will not yield\nthe most impressive gains, because their \"loads\"\nare likely to be highly correlated. With a UMTS\nand a DVB-T operator participating in a DSA\nscheme, [1] reports gains approaching 40%. Be-\nfore we introduce a wireless broadcast operator\ninto our scheme, we must complete an analysis\nsimilar to the present one, in order to understand\nits bidding behaviour. Then, we could compare\nour gains to those that have been reported.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nPerformed in the framework of the EU funded\nproject E2R.
