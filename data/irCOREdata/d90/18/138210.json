Recent \nPHASE TRANSITION KINETICS OF PST FILMS \neffort has been focused on the growth of PST as thin films directly onto silicon wafers in \norder to lower cost and improve device performance [3]. \n \nThe formation of perovskite PST can generally be divided into two categories:  in-situ \ngrowth of perovskite PST, or deposition of PST into a non-perovskite form followed by \na post-deposition anneal step to achieve perovskite conversion. For monolithic IR \ndetectors the thermal budget for PST deposition is limited by the underlying CMOS \ncircuitry which suffers from thermally induced degradation of the Al-Si interconnect \nmetallization [3].  Recently there has been a move away from the fully monolithic \napproach for PST based detectors in order to remove these thermal budget limitations \nand enable high merit figures for IR detection to be realized [4].  In this composite \nthermal detectors the arrays of microbridges are fabricated on an interconnect wafer, \nable to withstand temperatures of up to 1000 \u00b0C, which is then flip-chip bonded to the \nROIC [4]. \n \nIt has been shown that the use of excess lead during the sputtering deposition promotes \nthe formation of perovskite PST [5-6].  Todd et. Al [6-7] reported growth of perovskite \nPST at 530 \u00b0C by using sputtering techniques.  However, in-situ perovskite PST \nsputtering at elevated temperature can lead to difficulties with lead compositional \ncontrol and problems with equipment reliability.  Therefore a low temperature \ndeposition followed by a separate post-deposition anneal was preferred.  They also \nshowed that PST deposited at 450 \u00b0C formed a very well crystallised pyrochlore phase \nwhich was difficult to completely transform to perovskite during post-deposition \nannealing. A deposition temperature of 300 \u00b0C resulted in a weak pyrochlore\/amorphous \nphase that could be completely transformed to perovskite by a post-deposition rapid \nthermal anneal (RTA), although not within the CMOS thermal budget.  The processing \nregime was however well within the thermal budget of the interconnect wafer [4].  \nConventional oven annealing was also tried but the slow heat-up rates resulted in \nincomplete conversion to perovskite, due to lead loss from the PST film by diffusion and \nevaporation, and consequently inferior electrical properties compared to RTA annealed \nfilms [8]. \n \nExtensive research has been reported on the ordering of PST, however, only limited \nreports have been devoted to the crystallisation and very little if any on the kinetics of \nphase transitions of perovskite PST from its amorphous or pyrochlore phases.  In this \npaper we report our study on the kinetics of phase transitions from amorphous to \npyrochlore then to perovskite in PST thin films. \n \n \n \nEXPERIMENTAL  \n \nThe substrates used were (100)-Si single crystal wafers which were thermally oxidised \nand overcoated with a sputtered platinum\/titanium(Pt\/Ti) layer.  The PST was deposited \nby sputtering in a custom sputtering system which uses dual 8'' diameter RF magnetron \nsputtering targets in an argon\/10% oxygen atmosphere.  More details have been \npublished elsewhere [6-7]. The as-deposited wafer was cut into several pieces of squares \nJ. BATTAT et.al \nabout 10 mm x 10 mm, and each piece was then subjected to a series of RTA and \nstructural characterisation processes.  \n \nThe Avrami equation [9-10] has been widely used to model the kinetics of phase \ntransitions. The equation is: \n V(t) = 1 - exp(- k tn),  \nwhere V(t) is the transformed fraction at time t, n is  the Avrami coefficient whose value \nnormally varies from 1 to 3 [10] and k a rate constant. Mathcad 7 (MathSoft\u00ae) software \nwas used to simulate intensity profiles as functions of annealing time. \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nTheoretical Consideration \nIt is well established that upon annealing PST undergoes transitions from amorphous (A) \nto pyrochlore (Py) then  to perovskite (Pe), which can be represented as follows: \n \n  zyx nknk \u23af\u23af \u2192\u23af\u23af\u2192\u23af 2211 ,,  \n \nhere x, y, and z are the volume fractions of the amorphous, pyrochlore and perovskite \nphases respectively, n1,k1,n2, and k2 are transformation parameters in Avrami equation. \nTherefore  \n \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(1) \n \nFrom Avrami equation the amorphous phase fraction x at time t is: \n \n)exp( 11\nntkx \u2212= \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(2)  \n \ntherefore   xtnk ndtdx\n1\n11\n1 \u2212= \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(3)    \n \nIf there is an amount  r of the  pyrochlore phase which for some reasons does not \ntransform into perovskite, then the pyrochlore y can be divided into two parts: an active \ncomponent ya, which undergoes the transformation into z and is therefore dependent on \nall four transformation parameters n1,k1,n2, and k2, and a component yr which only \nundergoes transformation from the amorphous but does not convert into z, and therefore \nis only dependent on parameters n1 and k1. i.e., \n \nra yyy +=  \n \n1=++ zyx\nPHASE TRANSITION KINETICS OF PST FILMS \nwe do not know the exact time profile of the yr, but it is plausible to assume that the \nformation of this part of the pyrochlore also follows Avrami equation, i.e.,   \n ( )111 ntkr ery \u2212\u2212\u22c5= ,                     \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(4) \n \n  therefore  \n       \n1\n11 1\n11\nn\nr tkn\ndt\ndy etkrn \u2212\u2212=            \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(5) \n \nAccording to the Avrami equation, at any time t we also have \n \n  a\nn\ndt\ndz ytnk 122 2\n\u2212= \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(6) \n \ncombining the above equations  gives \n \na\nntkn\ndt\ndy\ndt\ndz\ndt\ndx\ndt\ndy ytnketknr\nn\npa 1\n22\n1\n11\n2\n1\n11)1( \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2212\u2212=\u2212\u2212=   \n                                                                                \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(7) \nwhich is a first order differential equation and can be manipulated to give the following \n \nsolution for ar yyy += = ( )111 ntker \u2212\u2212\u22c5  + ya :                               : \n \n( ) ( ) \u222b \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2212+\u2212\u22c5= \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 t kkntktk deeknererty nnnn\n0\n1\n11\n2\n2\n1\n112\n1\n1 11)( \u03c4\u03c4 \u03c4\u03c4  \n                                                                   \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(8) \nSubstitutes the expression for ya to equation (6) gives the following expression for z: \n \n( ) \u03c4\u03b8\u03b8\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03b8\u03b8\u03c4 ddeeknenkrtz t kknkn nnn\u222b \u222b \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\u22c5\u22c5\u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n0 0\n1\n11\n1\n22\n2\n2\n1\n11\n2\n221)(  \n                                                                             \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(9) \nLet y(t) and z(t) represents the theoretical volume fractions of  the pyrochlore and \nperovskite phases at time t respectively, py and pe the corresponding experimental \nvalues.

This suggests a diffusion \ncontrolled pyrochlore growth, with decreasing nucleation rate [10]. This is in good \nagreement with observations in PZT system where a high-number density of  small \npyrochlore grains appeared initially upon annealing from the amorphous matrix, the \nPHASE TRANSITION KINETICS OF PST FILMS \nnumber-density of the pyrochlore grains decreased in the latter stages of the annealing \nwhen perovskite phase was formed [11].  The Avrami coefficients n2 as obtained for the \ntransformation from pyrochlore to perovskite were very close to 1 for three temperatures \n650, 700 and 750  \u02daC and not largely deviated from 1-1.5 for the temperature 725 \u02daC, \nsuggesting also a diffusion controlled growth, without further nucleation after the initial \nstage [10]. This is also similar to the PZT system where the Avrami coefficient for the \nperovskite formation was found close to unity [11]. \n \nStructural Characterisation \nFIGURE 4a, b, c and d show cross section TEM micrographs the films RTA\u2019ed at 650, \n700, 725 and 750 \u02daC respectively. Two kinds of morphologies were observed\u2014one with \nsub-layered structure and another without. Films annealed at 650, 700 and 750 \u02daC all \nshowed columnar-like perovskite structure and sub-layers. A first thought might be that \nthese sub-layers are related to the repeated RTA annealing. However, no link between \nthe number of sub-layers and the repeated times of  RTA annealing was observed, e.g. \nthere were 21 sub-layers in the PST700 but there were only 15 times of repeated \nannealing. A close inspection found that the sub-layers were formed by the horizontal \nlinear distribution of voids. Vertical linear distribution of voids can also be seen in the \nfilm PST650. There were no regular distribution of voids in the films PST725 therefore \nno showing of sub-layer-like features. \n \nSEM investigation on the final annealed films revealed no significant difference in \nsurface morphologies among the films annealed at different temperatures. Perovskite \nPST grains were up to 500 nm in diameter and all the films had cracks. No apparent \nsecond phase grains were observed. Results of the compositional analysis for the films \nare summarised in Table 2. It can be seen that there was about 10% excess lead for the \nas-deposited film and some lead was lost during RTA treatment. However, there was an \ninsignificant compositional difference between the films annealed at different \ntemperatures and overall the films were  Pb-excess.  \n \nTable 2 : Summary of SEM EDX results, all results in atomic percent. \n O Sc Ta Pb \nPST as deposited 59.11 9.31 9.04 22.55 \nPST650 59.63 9.66 9.63 21.08 \nPST700 59.59 10.13 9.4 20.88 \nPST725 59.87 10.09 9.8 20.24 \nPST750 59.69 9.57 9.72 21.02 \nPST stoichiometry              60 10 10 20 \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nPST thin films for pyroelectric application have been deposited by rf sputtering and \ntransformed into the desired perovskite structure by rapid thermal annealing.
