However, limited empirical evidence has been reported on how it influences welfare\nreform. This paper draws upon evidence from the mental health system in Spain, where health\ncare is devolved to the regional states (autonomous communities), to examine whether policy\nreform of neglected policy areas may be triggered through heightened policy awareness and\nbetter participation of interested stakeholders. We find that regional devolution has helped to\nscale up mental health in some of Spain\u2019s autonomous regions relative to support for other\nservices. Evidence suggests that whilst fragmentation and certain historical legacies remain\npath dependent, regional devolution has indeed enhanced experimentation, reform and policy\ninnovation in mental health care. However, the expansion of mental health care coverage has\nbeen constrained by the lack of a clear definition of public coverage, as well as the need to meet\nthe demands of evidence-based policy in an era of cost-containment. Inequalities in access to\nmental health care remain; they are compounded by the stigma and discrimination experienced\nby people with mental health problems, which is a common challenge for all health systems in\nEurope.\nIntroduction\nMental health care often qualifies as the Cinderella service. Reforms have taken\nlonger to materialise due to the low priority devoted to mental health compared\nto other areas of welfare policy. We argue that this is the result of mental health\nseldom garnering significant attention in political debates, though evidence of\nsome progressive change in attitude can be seen through the increased attention\ndevoted to mental health policy across the European Union (EU) during the last\n2 j. costa-font et al.\ndecade. Much of this attitudinal change can be traced back to the publication of\na World Health Report in 2001 (WHO, 2001) that focused specially on mental\nhealth. It has been estimated that about three quarters of legislation in the\narea of mental health provision in Europe was introduced after 1990 (European\nCommission, 2005). Today there is widespread acceptance of the impacts of\npoor mental health (McDaid, 2008); unipolar depressive disorders alone are\nprojected to be the leading cause of years lived with disability by 2030 in the\nWHO European region (WHO, 2005). More than one in four of the European\npopulation can expect to experience a mental health problem in any one year\n(Wittchen and Jacobi, 2005). The European Parliament resolution of 19 February\n2009 recently highlighted the risks of poor physical health associated with poor\nmental health (European Parliament, 2009). For example, the risks for diabetes\nand cardiovascular disease are two to three times greater than those observed\nin the general population. Poor mental health is also acknowledged to have\nsubstantial impact beyond the health system; the adverse consequences for\nemployment opportunities, housing, contact with the criminal justice system\nand personal relationships are substantial (McDaid, 2005).\nAnother interpretation of this phenomenon reflects that understandings\nand\/or social constructions of mental illness have been evolving over time. This\nhas had an impact on the extent to which there is an acknowledged need for both\nsocial and medical responses (Rose, 2000; Rogers and Pilgrim, 2003). Moreover,\nit in part explains the nature of reforms over the least three decades. Community\nintervention leads to a process of deinstitutionalisation and integration ofmental\nhealth in the wider health system in the 1970s (Shorter, 1997). Another viewpoint\nis that although deinstitutionalisation may have been thought initially to be\neconomically attractive; the closure of long-stay institutions in some countries\nhas not always been accompanied by investment in alternative community-\nbased services (Goodwin, 1997). One aspect of reform, in particular since the\n1980s onwards, has been the increased emphasis on the use of psychiatric drug\ntreatments (Rose, 2007); the commercial market for pharmaceutical mental\nhealth treatments has consequently grown, covering not just serious mental\ndisorders such as psychosis but a wide range of anxiety and depressive disorders.\nIn contrast to the growth in importance of drug therapy, limited attention has\nbeen given to preventive mental health actions. However, the mechanisms that\nunderpin reformof neglected policy programmes are still largely to be researched.\nPolicy reforms have exhibited significant developments in southern Europe\ndue to its traditionally limited level of government intervention. At a national\nlevel, Italy has long been highlighted as a pioneer of mental health reform,\ninitiating moves away from a reliance on long-stay institutional care in the late\n1970s (Tansella and Williams, 1987). Such reforms began in Spain in the late\n1980s; but, unlike reform in Greece, the catalyst for reform was not international\ncriticism of their mental health system (Madianos et al., 1999). Furthermore,\ntackling neglect and mental health reform in a devolved system 3\nSpain can also be contrasted with Portugal, where major reforms only took place\nin the last decade (Oliveira and Pinto, 2005). However, Spain is of particular\ninterest becausemental health care reformhas occurred at a time of devolution of\ncentral governmental responsibility for health care. Reform in regionally specific\nhealth systems has enabled the integration of a relatively fragmented network of\nstatutory, church and other third sector mental-health-related services into an\nincreasingly unified package. This has been in part the immediate consequence\nof the completion of reforms in other areas of health and social welfare, as\nwell as increased awareness of the external impacts of poor mental health \u2013\nboth of which are consistent with lower-cost regional level experimentation to\nfoster policy innovation. As we argue in this paper, devolved governance, by\nimproving the chances of participation of both mental health service user and\nspecialist groups in the decision-making process, has acted as a catalyst for greater\nawareness.Hence, we claim that there is some room for reform in the institutional\nstructure of health systems to encourage investment in neglected areas such as\nmental health.\nHistorically, entitlement to mental health services had lacked transparency;\nvague definitions of entitlements were always provided by laws and regulations.\nThese were further complicated by the shifting boundaries between health\nand social care (Salvador-Carulla et al., 2006). Across many countries, Spain\nbeing no exception, there have been moves to have much more evidence-\ninformedpolicy, includinggreateruseof cost effectiveness criteria.Moves towards\ndevolution in Spain have occurred during a time when the case for investment\nin mental health care has been considerably strengthened by the growth of the\nevidence-based medicine, indicating a range of performance effective and cost\neffective interventions to both prevent and treat mental health problems and\nhelp individuals maintain and\/or regain their individual autonomy (Knapp and\nMcDaid, 2009; Chisholm, 2005). The case has become even stronger when we\ninclude impacts outside the health sector.\nThe proliferation of evidence-based decision making does help to explain\nwhymental health care has expanded.However, in Spain devolution, we contend,\nhas also been essential in securing the information and the support for mental\nhealth care reform based on evidence. Health technology agencies, some of\nwhich considered the cost effectiveness of certain mental health treatments, were\ndeveloped in different autonomous communities and have looked at mental\nhealthprogrammes.This alsomayhavehelped speedupmental health innovation\nin different parts of the country. Some regions have also invested in promoting\nmental health policy and practice at a European level: major international events\non mental health have been co-sponsored and hosted by the governments of the\nBasque Country and Catalonia during the last decade. Parallels to the Spanish\ncase can now be seen in the UK following devolution, with Scotland in particular\ndeveloping its own distinct mental health policy and also being visible on the\n4 j. costa-font et al.\nEuropean stage. One obvious downside of devolution and decentralisation is,\nhowever, that the reform proceeds at different speeds across the whole of the\ncountry, potentially leading to widening temporal differences in access to services\nbetween different autonomous communities in Spain.\nThis article therefore attempts to examine the institutional mechanisms\nthat explain the increasing attention given to mental health care in Spain at a\ntime when there has been the development of a devolved system of health care\ngovernance.1 We draw upon the process of mental health care reform to highlight\npertinent evidence on how different reforms came to pass, and their associated\nconsequences, both intended and unintended. Policymakers, like many others in\nsociety, traditionally wishedmental health care to be low profile and \u2018out of sight,\nout of mind\u2019. However, the increased participation of stakeholders, including\ncivil society organisations, not only at national but primarily at regional level,\nappears also to have contributed to the scaling up of mental health care reform\non the welfare reform agenda.\nWe look explicitly at the extent to which political decentralisation or\ndevolution, in place since the early 1980s, in conjunction with the emergence\nof mental health policy at a European level, have both acted as catalysts for\nreform.2 Spain, like most European countries, has experienced a rapid societal\ntransformation with limited cultural adaptation, although institutional reforms\nrunning parallel to rapid economic and political change over the last two decades.\nThe country has shifted from being an autocratic society in the 1970s to resemble\nmore to a liberal democracy in the early years of the twenty-first century. The\ninception of a parliamentary democracy in the late seventies accompanied by\nthe creation of regional health administrations arising from the decentralisation\nof the National Health System (NHS) stand as key tenets of a stable political\nsystem. Paradoxically, rather than vetoing reform, devolutionmay have triggered\nthe development of a consolidated health and social welfare system (Costa-Font,\n2010), which in turn impacts on the principles underpinning mental health care.\nWe then examine the underpinning policy processes behind the scaling\nup and consolidation of what remains a highly fragmented and privatised\nmental health network. As in many other western European countries, Spain\nhas markedly moved away from a heavy reliance on long-stay institutional\n(asylum) care, where policy aimed at protecting society from potential \u2018harm\u2019,\nto the development of a network of mental health centres which provide\nservices in the community and have as one of their aims the prevention of\nsocial exclusion. Furthermore, and particularly in respect of southern European\nUnion (EU) member states, EU membership has led to a form of cognitive\nEuropeanisation (Guillen and Alvarez, 2004), which explains the role of the\nEU as a learning platform leading to cross border policy spillovers. It is a\nchannel for a process of rapid diffusion of certain health policy practices and an\nincrease in epidemiological evidence. We discuss the process of integration and\ntackling neglect and mental health reform in a devolved system 5\ncoordination of mental health care services and the effect of decentralisation, as\nwell as steps to increase awareness and utilisation of services. Furthermore, given\nthat the understandings of mental illness are culturally nuanced, the institutional\nreform of mental health care services should be adapted to the existing regional\nheterogeneity.\nBackground\nDevolution and policy reform\nThe regional devolution of welfare state responsibilities is theoretically\nan institutional device to accommodate heterogeneous preferences and needs\n(Oates, 1993). Generally, it opens the way to the development of different social\npolicies, and therefore for experimentation in exchange for departing from the\nprinciple of uniformity in the provision of care. Models of devolution differ\nin the institutional legacies that affect the distribution of political and fiscal\npowers. Thus, the distribution of fiscal resources can be inspired by principles\nof fiscal equivalence (Olson, 1969) whereby governments\u2019 fiscal capacity should\nadjust to the characteristics of each jurisdiction to provide incentives to perform\nefficiently. Similarly, these principles are to be balanced out with the need for\nregional cohesion.\nOne of the main concerns resulting from devolution lies in its potential\neffects in curtailing welfare development in the form of a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019.\nHowever, evidence suggests that when decentralisation of spending authority is\nnot accompanied by similar levels of decentralisation of revenue authority, but\nfunded through revenue-sharing and intergovernmental grant schemes, overall\nspending is more likely to expand (Rodden, 2003, Costa-Font and Rico, 2006).\nHowever, the answer to another, possibly more significant, question for social\npolicy analysts \u2013 how a devolved form of welfare governance translates into\npolicy reform initiative \u2013 is unknown. Particularly relevant is reform of neglected\npackages, where support or capacity might be region specific.\nWe contend that policy reform builds on the identification of opportunities\nand instruments to overcome formal and informal constraints that might\nfrustrate policy proposals. Formal constraints to reform include autocratic\nprocedures as well as legislative and decision-making processes which can slow\ndownreformandevenvetopolicies that don\u2019t commandacountry-widemajority.\nSimilarly, informal constraints to welfare development include stigma associated\nwith some policy areas, including mental health. Other constraints can involve\ncost-containment pressures and social movements, such as the anti-psychiatry\nmovement in some European countries. Finally, the fragmentation of service\nprovision also acted as a constraint on policy development in comparison with\nother welfare packages. The third sector3 has long played a major role in mental\nhealth practice, but has not been well integrated with public services. One\n6 j. costa-font et al.\nconsequence had been spectacular institutional fragmentation, especially when\nregulation was in the hands of underfunded and uncoordinated local authorities\n(Ferrara, 1996).\nAgainst these constraints, devolution is arguably one device at hand to water\ndown policy reform constraints by tempering the requirements for majority\nsupport where opportunities for reform arise at a regional level. Increasing\nawareness of mental health as an issue is acknowledged regionally, which creates\nthe preconditions for institutions to further develop policy and practice.\nContext: health care devolution in Spain\nEmerging from a fragmented, though mandatory social security system, the\n1986 General Health Care Act re-founded the Spanish National Health System\n(NHS) along the lines of a tax funded andpolitically decentralisedmodel of health\ncare provision. The objectives of the health system were driven towards both\nhealth promotion and illness prevention. Entitlement to health carewas extended\nto all residents, with equality of access and a reduction in social and geographical\nvariations, along with defining more implicitly its efficiency goals. Access to\nhealth care was defined to be free at the point of use for all residents (including\nundocumented migrants), with user co-payments restricted to pharmaceuticals\nprimarily.Thehealth carepackagehasbeendefinedas \u2018comprehensive\u2019 by analysts\n(Lopez-Casasnovas et al., 2005) although, in addition to mental health, coverage\nfor some services, such as long-term care and dental services, remains limited\nand still varies according to region-specific demands (due to differences in policy\npriorities). Simultaneously, health and social care have, alongside education,\nbeen key packages of a process of welfare state decentralisation (Costa-Font and\nPons-Novell, 2007; Lopez-Casanovas et al., 2005).\nThe regional devolution of health care responsibilities took place in\ntwo waves. A first wave ranged from 1980 to 2001 and granted health care\nresponsibilities to seven region states (autonomous communities). Then a second\nwave after 2001 extended the same responsibilities to all remaining ten regions.\nEach regional government has a specific statutory law that covers the provision\nof publicly financed health and social care. Both regional governments and local\nauthorities are financed by tax revenues that are vertically assigned through block\ngrants allocated on an unadjusted capitation system. Regional health and social\ncare services are subject to (unenforced) cooperation and coordination through\nthe Inter-territorial Council of Regional Ministries of Health and Social Care.\nThe budget retained by the national Ministry of Health is restricted mainly\nto quality control, surveillance and safety, alongside health promotion and\nconsumer protection. All in all, welfare devolution was introduced in less than\ntwo decades, so that, whilst in 1981 only 13 per cent of public expenditures were\nsub-central, by 1999 this had increased to 49 per cent \u2013 although tax revenues\ntackling neglect and mental health reform in a devolved system 7\nwere kept centralised and devolved tax revenues barely accounted for 11 per cent\nof total revenues in 2003.\nMental health reform\nPrior to the mid 1980s, a substantial proportion of mental health care\nwas provided outside the National Health System, by the private sector albeit\nwith some funding from local and provincial authorities (Vasquez-Barquero\nand Garcia, 1999). Public mental health services when available were highly\nfragmented, dominated by residential care (Salvador-Carulla et al., 2006) often\norganise in collaboration with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and\nreligious groups. Service coordination was limited.\nThe first steps to mental health care reform were taken in 1983 with\nthe establishment of a Ministerial Commission on mental health. Reforms\nintended to modernise the mental health care network were announced by this\nCommission in 1985 (Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo, 1985), and implemented\nalongside general health system reform in the General Health Act of 1986. These\nreforms had a number objectives, both explicit and implicit: (a) guaranteeing that\nsupport for people with mental health problems would be provided within the\ngeneral network of health care services and specifically within primary care;\n(b) redefining the therapeutic meaning of psychiatric hospitalisation, which\nthus lost its pre-eminence in psychiatry; (c) providing adequate community\nservices and social support to make it possible to rehabilitate and resettle\nlong-stay psychiatric residents in the community; (d) bringing about changes\nin the community to prevent the marginalisation of these individuals; and\n(e) guaranteeing the civil rights of people with mental health problems.\nMental health care was better integrated within the national health system\nand within primary care; service charges other than for psychoanalysis and\nhypnosis were reimbursed within the general health care package. For instance,\nin 1986 in the newly created Andalusian health care service, primary care began\nto serve as a gate-keeping system for specialist care. Mental health needs were\nalso better integrated with other specialist services provided by the Andalusian\nhealth service. Subsequently, this process was replicated in some other regions\nand eventually extended countrywide. A specific set of Diagnosis Related Groups\n(DRG) tariffs for mental disorders was also added to the national DRG system,\nwhich was used to help reimburse health care facilities for the services provided.\nAmong the consequences of this mental health care reform process was\nfurther impetus for de-institutionalisation. This implied a shift from a system\nbased on old asylums to one centred on care in the community, as in some other\nwestern countries. As illustrated in Figure 1, the number of beds in psychiatric\nhospitals has continued to steadily decline. By 2006, there were 46.59 psychiatric\nbeds per 100,000population (WHO, 2009), one of the lower rates in the European\n8 j. costa-font et al.\nFigure 1. Psychiatric beds per 100,000 population Spain 1980\u20132006\nSource: WHO Europe, Health for All Database, January 2009.\nUnion. There has also been a shift away from specialist psychiatric long-stay units\nto psychiatric wards located in general hospitals.\nOne reason for this reduction in long-stay beds has been the mainstreaming\nof mental health within general health and social care systems, which have long\nrelied on a mixture of out-patient, in-patient and residential facilities, as well\nas multidisciplinary teams of health and social care professionals. Workforce\nregulation and accreditation criteria were completely reformed, and a cadre of\nnew social care professionals created, including social workers who progressively\nbecame entitled to the same level of professional standing as health care workers.\nAnother consequence of mental health reform was the creation of a national\ntraining programme for psychiatrists, along with the development of a network\nof mental health units to provide out-patient services upon GP referral, covering\nthe sameHealth Areas envisaged for general health care, serving between 200,000\nand 250,000 inhabitants. By 1994, about 550 mental health centres had been set\nup and they have continued to progressively expand; this has contributed to the\nrelatively high rates of consultation that are found today in Spain.\nThese reforms also help explain the expansion in the number of psychiatrists,\nfrom 3.9 per 100,000 in 1982 to 5.12 per 100,000 by 1994; in addition, a network\nof new mental health care professionals began to emerge, including psychiatric\nnurses, neurologists and psychologists. The early reforms of the 1980s really only\naddressed the needs of a small number of people with severe mental health\nproblems, namely those with psychosis who had been hospitalised, rather than\ntackling the broader exclusion of people living with mental health problems\ntackling neglect and mental health reform in a devolved system 9\nTABLE 1.

Therefore, wider reforms were needed, which\nrequired public support.\nA subsequent wave of reforms took place in 1995 (Royal Decree 63\/1995).\nSignificant developments included defining diagnostic and follow-up treatments,\nnamely drug treatment and group or family psychotherapy, as well as the\nconditions for hospitalisation. A national therapeutic essential drug catalogue,\nincluding drugs for mental disorders, was published.\nMuchmore recently, in 2006, a law on the \u2018Promotion of Personal Autonomy\nand the Assistance for Dependent People\u2019 defined social care as a personal right\nfor people with severe disabilities, including mental illness. In parallel, some\nregional governments have passed similar social care regulations; this process\nhas been complemented by the development of new coordination and financing\nmechanisms for health and social care at the regional level.\nWhat impact have these reforms had? One way of evaluating success is to\nlook at data from the 2006 Eurobarometer survey of the general public on service\nutilisation in Spain and the EU overall. Table 1 reveals that, whilst Spaniards on\naverage used relatively less general practitioner (GP) services formental disorders\nthan other Europeans, their use was roughly the same when the sample was\nrestricted to those with a mental disorder. Whilst they were on average less likely\nto use a pharmacist\u2019s advice, they appeared to bemore likely to visit a psychiatrist.\nRates of contact with therapists and psychoanalysts were similar to those in other\ncountries; however, there were lower rates of psychotherapy and higher rates of\nnursing care. Clearly, greater contact with mental health care reflects increasing\nactivity, though it does not saymuch on the effects on efficiency and productivity\nin tackling need.\n10 j. costa-font et al.\nFinally, and consistent with other European countries, reforms have\nincreased the use of pharmaceutical interventions within the mental health\nsystem. Indeed, the use of antidepressants in Spain, such as paroxetine, doubled\nin only eight years from 1997 to 2004, while sales of all antidepressants almost\ntripled from \u20ac169 to \u20ac447 million in the same period (Girona-Brumos et al.,\n2006). Therefore, up to a certain point, reforms in mental health care have\nopened up opportunities for greater influence by the pharmaceutical industry in\nthe way countries tackle mental neglect (Rose, 2007).\nPrejudices\nAs we argue in this paper, the regional devolution of health care\nresponsibilities, rather than being a dilutant, has in fact triggered an escalating\nawareness of the need for reform. Differences in the priorities attached to mental\nhealth across Spain reflected in differences in social values and views as towhether\nmental health should be largely an individual or family responsibility. Those\nregions that had already made mental health reform a priority no longer had\nto wait for countrywide agreement and were able to proceed with change. The\ndownside, of course, was that traditionally less progressive regions were then\nmore likely to lag behind in reform. Thus, the implementation of reforms has\nbeen geographically uneven, and generally has taken place in regions that have\nembraced health care responsibilities as compared to those regions were health\ncare has remained as a centralised responsibility.\nIn the health system generally, due to cross regional learning and voluntary\ncooperation, geographical inequalities in services appear to have levelled out\n(Lopez-Casanovas, 2005). In the case of mental health, however, significant\ndifferences between the autonomous communities in expenditures on mental\nhealth remain: estimates for specific autonomous communities range from just\n1.5 per cent in Extremadura to 9.4 per cent in Catalonia (Gisbert et al., 2007;\nSalvador-Carulla, 2008). Whether those regions that have prioritised mental\nhealth will act as catalysts for others to follow, as in other areas of health, remains\nto be seen. However, empirical evidence reveals that devolution has acted as a\ncatalyst for mental health policy development in Andalucia, the Basque Country,\nCatalonia, Galicia and recently in Madrid, Castilla Leon, Murcia and especially\nin Extremadura once health care responsibilities were finally devolved after 2002.\nThese regions have been at the forefront of policy developments, which in turn\nhave begun to spill over to other parts of the country. All have developed regional\nhealth plans after devolution specifying mental health targets. However, this\ndevelopment comes at the cost of less central command and the expectation that\ngreater cooperation and policy learning will instead take place.\nAnother key concern with devolution is in its effects on the mixed economy\nof care. As already noted, mental health care services exhibit a higher reliance on\nboth private inputs and informal care by families, who effectively are the main\ntackling neglect and mental health reform in a devolved system 11\nsocial care providers for people living in the community. However, reform has\nintegrated both private and community support in the mental health package.\nThemental carepackagewasupdated in 2006 (RoyalDecree 1030\/2006) to include\nboth primary and specialised care, including both treatment and preventive\nservices, and to formalise the consolidation of a communitarianmodel of mental\nhealth care. This was a first step towards integration, given the coordination\nbetween levels of care (primary and specialist), alongside health and social care\ndimensions.5 However, an explicit definition of the limits of mental health care\nprovision has yet to be agreed. This has to do not only with the heterogeneity\nof social care needs, but principally with other more structural features that\nconstrain reform, mainly the still limited political visibility of reform which\ndecentralisation helps to curb. Yet, still to date the percentage of individuals that\nuse primary mental health care is lower than in most European countries (Sicras\nMainar et al., 2007).\nIntegration and coordination\nOne of the additional questions that devolution poses is on its impact on\nthe integration and mainstreaming of mental health within the general health\nsystem and the coordination of services to support people with mental health\nneeds across different areas of social welfare, such as housing and employment.\nWith regard to integration, following devolution each autonomous community\ndeveloped its own mental health strategy, with specific regional priorities\n(Montero et al., 2004). This led to different approaches for the better integration\nof mental health within the general health system, and has contributed to a\nreduction in the use of long-stay care beds, with a greater proportion of beds\nprovided in general rather than specialist psychiatric hospitals over the last two\ndecades.\nThree regions, Navarre, Andalusia and Asturias,6 closed all of their\npsychiatric hospitals, while other regions retained some psychiatric hospitals\nat the same time as investing in the development of intermediate and specialist\nservices (e.g. Basque Country, Catalonia, Madrid).\nCoordination between services provided within the health care system and\nother sectors has improved after devolution although remains poor compared\nto European standards. Social care services were devolved to the autonomous\ncommunities in 1997, but the devolution of health was not completed until 2002.\nHence, even in regionswhere therewas a reduction in the use of institutional care,\nessential alternative community-based services, which often are the responsibility\nof social care rather than health, have not always been in place (Salvador-Carulla\net al., 2005). Although limited coordination between social and health care is\na common problem worldwide, in Spain this is aggravated by superimposed\nprovincial structures which have not been removed after the creation of regional\n12 j . costa-font et al.\nTABLE 2.

The assymetry of entitlement implies that social care services, unlike health\nservices, are still subject both to means testing and the use of co-payments. At a\nnational level, a clarification of entitlements to mental health services, regardless\nof whether they are provided within the health or social care systems, is merited\nto help promote continuity in care.\nDevolution has led to the creation of intersectorial agencies to promote\ncoordination between health and social care, as in Andalucia or Catalonia.\nHowever, its effects are marked in other regions too. The clearest example\nis that of Extremadura, the poorest autonomous community in the south-\nwest of the country, has fully integrated health and social care responsibilities\nwithin one administrative structure. Thus, while challenges remain regarding\nthe coordination of health and social care, decentralisation does appear to\nprovide scope for regional experimentation and policy diffusion. Experiences\nof coordination at the regional level are not incompatible with country-wide\ncoordination in institutional design, particularly following the creation in 2008\nof the joint Ministry of Health and Social Policies.\nAwareness and utilisation\nHow has mental health reform shifted institutional paradigms and attitudes\ntowards mental health and the use of services? The evidence points to significant\nchange, at least in regions that have chosen to prioritise mental health reform.\nTable 2 suggests that attitudes towards mental health in Spain appear to exhibit\nawareness, although we lack longitudinal data to sustain any time pattern claims.\nCompared to the EU average, we find that fewer people see poor mental health\nas being a threat to others, and instead it is seen as something to be treated\n(Eurobarometer, 2005). Although 13 per cent of respondents stated that people\nwith mental disorders are unpredictable, only a minority blame individuals for\ntheirmental disorders; this is a significantly lower percentage than theEUaverage.\ntackling neglect and mental health reform in a devolved system 13\nTABLE 3.

Both service user\ngroups and the antipsychiatry movement were active in calling for a reduction in\nthe use of institutional care. The latter movement however, which opposed the\nmedicalisation of psychsocial problems by the psychiatric system, ultimately had\nlittle influence on Spanish reforms, mainly because of a lack of resources (Biglia\nand Gordo-Lopez, 2006).\nEvidence of modernisation can be found in Table 3, suggesting an increasing\nuse of mental health care in the total population as compared to the EU as a\nwhole which explains today\u2019s higher reliance on formal care. A major problem is\nappropriateness of care, as about 13 per cent of visits tomental health care services\nin a one year period occurred among people who did not appear to meet the\nconditions for any common mental disorder (Alonso et al., 2007). Paradoxically,\nthough, Alonso et al. (2007) suggest that Spain appears among those European\ncountries exhibiting the lowest consultation rates among those without mental\ndisorder, indicating low prevention efforts.\nAs may be expected following a process of regional devolution, evidence on\nthe existing mix of mental health services exhibits regional variability in care\npractices (Aizpuru et al., 2008). The number of psychiatric beds for people with\nsevere mental health problems ranges from five to 23 per 100,000 population\n(median 10), for non-severe problems between zero and 59 per 100,000 (median\n27), and psychiatrists between one and eight per 100,000 population (median\n4). Figure 2 reveals that for 30\u201340 per cent of the population, mental health\nhas influenced their social activities, although this is still below the EU average.\nHowever, it is difficult to tell whether this evidence indicates a lower prevalence\nor a higher underreporting ofmental disorders due to stigma or other underlying\nsocial motivations, which may be spatially correlated.\n14 j. costa-font et al.\nQuestion: During the past four weeks, how much of the time has your physical health or emotional\nproblems interfered with social activities?\nFigure 2. Self-reported effects of mental or emotional disorders\nSource: Eurobarometer, 64.4, 2006.\nDiscussion\nThis article has sought to argue that mental health care has been a traditionally\nneglected component of the welfare policy agenda, and that reforms have been\ndriven by (a) an increasing awareness of the economic and social impact of\npoor mental health, which has helped to transform perceptions of mental health\n(Rogers and Pilgrim, 1996, 2003), coupled with (b) increasingly robust evidence-\nbased actions to reduce these impacts. Regional devolution of health and social\ncare responsibilities has been key in providing an opportunity for policy and\ninstitutional innovation, has enhanced coordination within and external to the\nhealth care sector it is found to assist evidence-based decision making through\nthe action of health technology agencies.Moreover, devolution has also helped to\ncurb the long-standing shifting of services to means-tested social care (Salvador-\nCarulla et al., 2006).\nAs mental health has risen up the European Union agenda, it has also been\nan issue whereby devolved administrations across Europe, such as Scotland or\nthe Basque country, have been relatively more active compared to the rest of the\ncountry, for instance providing co-financing for Europeanwork onmental health\nreform and sending delegations to the WHO Ministerial Conference on mental\nhealth in Helsinki in 2005. Attitudes and reactions to people with mental health\nproblems reveal evidence of increasing awareness, which in turn is helping to\nengender a climate amenable to reform. Paradoxically though, the development\nof mental health centres has shaped behavioural responses demystifying the issue\nand increasing its priority within health and social care provision. Finally, mental\nhealth reform should be examined in the light of a wider social change, which\nin Spain, in common with many other European countries, is induced by a new\nstructure of working life, with a much greater reliance on work done in high\ntackling neglect and mental health reform in a devolved system 15\npressure service and high technology sectors rather than in manufacturing and\nagriculture (Parent-Thirion et al., 2007).\nThe thriving mixed economy of mental health care provision can be\nexplained by a larger price sensitivity compared to other health care services\n(Frank and McGuire, 2000),7 coupled with the historical fragmentation of\nservices and the lack of clarity over the boundaries between health and social\ncare. That is to say, the state and the various independent sectors have all been\nactive, although with varying degrees of coordination, in service delivery and\nfunding, alongside substantial contributions of family carers and volunteers.\nThis is not to say that removal of financial barriers to mental health care would\nautomatically equalise utilisation and capacity to benefit, as other social barriers\nremain (Costa-Font and Gil, 2009), such as stigma and imperfect information.\nTo tackle the latter by improving coordination, recent reforms call for integration\nof the health and social care packages, improve prevention and abandonment\nof the traditional social-assistance model for one where mental health care is a\nspecialised area of health care subject to similar principles.\nThis paper has sought to argue that the prioritisation of mental health\nproblems in the health care reform agenda depends heavily on the institutional\norganisationof the system, andprimarily on the set upofwelfare devolution along\nwith cost containment pressures and evidence-based policy making. Although\nmental health care can be highly expensive to provide (Kovess-Masterfety et al.,\n2007), it is not obvious howmental health programmes are traded off with other\nhealth-related programmes.\nIn further developing mental health services, it is important to ensure that\nthere is an appropriate balance of care, including help with housing and in\nreturning to open employment, which are also elements of a balanced mental\nhealth system (Thornicroft and Tansella, 2004). However, as we argue in this\npaper, one catalyst formental health reform is greater awareness of the impacts of\npoormental health and the recognition that many of these impacts are avoidable;\nmore positive public attitudes can also help to facilitate change. As we show in\nthis study, triggers for mental health care reform in Spain have shown to be more\nreadily engendered through initiatives fostered at a sub-national level.\nNotes\n1 The purpose of this paper is to examine reform of mental health policy and the mental\nhealth system in Spain. In order to do that, we follow the standard approach in the scientific\nliterature as it may be seen in other similar documents published by WHO (WHO-AIMS),\nWHO-Europe, European Union (HiT) and reports at country level (Italy, Chile, Israel)\nwhere international standards such as the classification of mental disorders at the ICD-10\nare not a matter of discussion. The meaning and the ontology of mental health are beyond\nthe scope of this paper.\n16 j. costa-font et al.\n2 In culturally heterogeneous countries, decentralisation is an institutional device to adjust\nhealth policy priorities at regional level. Such devolution provides an opportunity for natural\nexperimentation between approaches in different regions.\n3 We have noted that many mental heath services were provided privately by civil society\norganisations because of the lack of state funded services. During the second half of the\ncentury, this lack of service meant a reliance on the voluntary sector, typically the religious\norders, who indeed owned many psychiatric and university hospitals.\n4 The process began in 1981when Catalonia took control of its health care system; by 1994, this\nhad extended to Andalucia, the Basque Country, Valencia, Navarra, Galicia and the Canary\nIslands.\n5 The process of reform though did not come to fruition until 2007, when the Ministry\nof Health put forward a working document setting out priorities for mental health, which\ncontainednewclinical guidelines for physicians and specialists to identify andpreventmental\nhealth problems. Similar strategic actions have been set up for specificmental-health-related\nproblems, such as a strategic plan to curtail substance abuse.\n6 In Navarre many long-term residential patients were transferred to psychiatric hospitals in\nother regions\n7 Hence, if US evidence is transferred to a European context, we could conclude that if\nindividuals are subject to cost sharing, they are more likely to go uncovered, and if the\nlatter holds, people with mental health problems are more politically vulnerable to cutbacks\ncompared to other areas of the health system.\nReferences\nAizpuru, F., Latorre, K., Iba\u00b4n\u02dcez, B., Pe\u00b4rez de Arriba, J., Mosquera, F., Bernal-Delgado, E. for\nGrupo Atlas-VPM (2008), \u2018Variabilidad de la tasa de hospitalizaciones por problemas de\nsaludmental en centros hospitalarios de agudos\u2019, Atlas de Variaciones en la Pra\u00b4ctica Me\u00b4dica\nen el Sistema Nacional de Salud (\u2018Variability of the rate of hospitalisation due to metal\nillness in acute hospitals\u2019, Atlas of National Health System Variability in Clinical Practice),\nNo. 5.\nAlonso, J., Codony, M., Kovess, V. et al.
