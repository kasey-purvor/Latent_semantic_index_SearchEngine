It is shown that a strong configuration mixing among the projected states is responsible\nfor the appearance of the tilted bands near to, but slightly above, the yrast line in even-even tungsten isotopes.\nVarious tilted bands in 184Os are also predicted. @S0556-2813~98!50701-7#\nPACS number~s!: 21.60.Cs, 21.10.Re, 21.60.Ev, 27.70.1qThe study of high-angular-momentum phenomena has\nprovided a deep understanding of the motion of nucleons in\na rotating mean field. It is known that this motion is strongly\nperturbed by the Coriolis interaction in the high-j intruder\norbitals and, for instance, shows up in the form of the back-\nbending phenomenon at high angular momenta @1,2#. The\nconventional interpretation of the backbending is in terms of\na crossing of the s band with the ground-state band @3#. The\ns band has two quasiparticles coupled to low-K and orbiting\naround the rotational axis. ~\u2018\u2018K\u2019\u2019 is the projection of the total\nangular momentum along the symmetry axis!. The s band\nrequires less collective rotational energy to generate angular\nmomentum and becomes energetically favored at higher\nspins as compared to the ground-state band.\nFor a partially rotation-aligned state formed from a two-\nquasiparticle ~2-qp! excitation, the total K quantum number\nof the state can be obtained either by the addition or subtrac-\ntion of the V quantum numbers of the individual quasiparti-\ncles. We thus can have two kinds of couplings: a 2-qp state\nwith a larger total K ~high-K! and a state with a smaller K\n~low-K!. We can discuss two situations according to the shell\nfilling: in the lower half of the intruder subshell, both indi-\nvidual quasiparticle states have small V numbers and the\ntotal K numbers for both of the coupling schemes are rela-\ntively small. Therefore, they both can contribute to the s\nband. However, when we move to the upper half of the sub-\nshell, both of the individual quasiparticle states have larger\nV numbers. The coupling in this case will lead to two 2-qp\nstates with very different total K values\u2014one is small and\nthe other is large. Usually, only the low-K state is assumed to\ncontribute to the s band.\nHowever, one should keep in mind that in the above dis-\ncussion, we have assumed that the rotational axis is perpen-\ndicular to the symmetry axis. In this case, high-K bands are\nless easy to align along the rotational axis because it requires\nmore energy to generate angular momentum. Nevertheless,\nthere is experimental evidence that as the Fermi surface\nmoves into the upper half of the intruder subshell, the states\nwith high-K start emerging around the yrast line ~with the\nlowest eigenenergy for each angular momentum! and these\nbands start competing with the low-K s bands @4#. This has570556-2813\/98\/57~1!\/26~5!\/$15.00been observed in W, Re, and Os nuclei @4\u20138# challenging the\ntraditional cranking picture. It seems to suggest a modifica-\ntion of the conventional picture that nuclei should always\nrotate around an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis\n@9,10#. This led to the idea of the tilted axis cranking ~TAC!\napproach in order to interpret @8,11,12# the high-K bands,\nsubsequently called t bands.\nOur interest in this paper is to study the interplay between\nthe ground-state band, the low-K s band and the high-K t\nband near the yrast line. It is observed in 182W @5# that the\nyrare ~the first excited state for each angular momentum!\nband has t-band structure and does not change its character\nappreciably to high spins. However, the yrast configuration\ndepicts a rapid change in moment of inertia and the continu-\nation of the yrast band is not the t band, despite the expec-\ntation that the t band would cross the g band. We would like\nto understand this anomalous behavior of the band crossings\nin this mass region and, in general, the mechanism behind\nthe occurrence of the high-K bands near the yrast line using\nthe projected shell model ~PSM! @13#. This model is ideal for\nstudying these features since the angular-momentum projec-\ntion can be performed for each K configuration and the mix-\ning among the different K states can be evaluated by diago-\nnalizing the shell model Hamiltonian in the projected basis.\nBands with different K configurations are calculated without\nassuming a semiclassical tilted axis. However, as we shall\nsee, t bands appear low in energy after angular-momentum\nprojection and configuration mixing. The present calcula-\ntions are performed for even-even tungsten isotopes,\n182,180,178W, which exhibit a large structural variation.\n182,180W contain well-developed t-band structures @5,6#,\nwhereas 178W shows a more regular s-band crossing @14,15#.\nThe PSM approach is applicable for the low- and high-\nspin states in heavy nuclei and is based on the shell model\nphilosophy. The PSM uses a deformed Nilsson single-\nparticle basis, unlike the conventional shell model which\nuses a spherically symmetric single-particle basis. The de-\nformed basis has the advantage of incorporating important\nnuclear correlations more readily, especially for a well-\ndeformed system. While this shell-model basis violates the\nrotational symmetry, it can be restored by the standard\nangular-momentum projection technique @16#. The pairingR26 \u00a9 1998 The American Physical Society\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\n57 R27PROJECTED SHELL MODEL ANALYSIS OF TILTED ROTATIONcorrelations are included by performing Bardeen-Cooper-\nSchreiffer ~BCS! calculations with the Nilsson states. Thus,\nthe shell-model truncation is carried out in the quasiparticle\n~qp! space with the qp vacuum, uf& defined through the BCS\ntransformation. Using the PSM, it has been demonstrated\nthat one can account quantitatively for many high-spin phe-\nnomena @13#.\nIn this work we have used the following Hamiltonian @13#\nH\u02c6 5H\u02c6 02\n1\n2 x(\nm\nQ\u02c6 m\u2020 Q\u02c6 m2GMP\u02c6 \u2020P\u02c6 2GQ(\nm\nP\u02c6 m\n\u2020 P\u02c6 m , ~1!\nwhere H\u02c6 0 is the spherical single-particle energy. The second\nterm is the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction and the last\ntwo terms are the monopole and quadrupole pairing interac-\ntions, respectively. The interaction strengths are determined\nas follows: the quadrupole interaction strength x is adjusted\nso that the known quadrupole deformation \u00ab2 from the self-\nconsistent mean-field calculations is obtained. In our mean-\nfield Nilsson potential, which provides the optimal deformed\nbasis, the hexadecapole deformation has also been included.\nIn the present calculations, we use \u00ab250.225,0.232,0.240\n~with \u00ab450.057,0.048,0.040) for 182W, 180W, and 178W,\nrespectively @17#. The monopole pairing strength GM is\nGM\n65@21.2213.9(N7Z)\/A#3A21 @13#, with \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019 for neu-\ntrons and \u2018\u20182\u2019\u2019 for protons. The quadrupole pairing strength\nGQ is assumed to be proportional to GM and the proportion-\nality constant is fixed to be 0.16 in the present work. These\nstrengths are consistent with those used in previous works\nfor the same mass region @13#.\nIn the present work, we have assumed that the deformed\nsingle-particle states have axial symmetry. Thus, the basis\nstates uwk& have K as a good quantum number. In the calcu-\nlation, the configuration space consists of the three major\nshells for each kind of nucleon: N53, 4, and 5, for protons\nand N 5 4, 5, and 6 for neutrons. The chosen quasiparticle\nsubspace is spanned by the basis set\n$uf&, ani\n\u2020 an j\n\u2020 uf&, apk\n\u2020 apl\n\u2020 uf&, ani\n\u2020 an j\n\u2020 apk\n\u2020 apl\n\u2020 uf&%.\n~2!\nThe vacuum state uf& has K50, while the 2- and 4-qp states,\nwhich are typically from the intruder orbitals, can have any\nK numbers according to coupling.\nProjection of good angular momentum onto each intrinsic\nstate generates the rotational band associated with a certain\nintrinsic configuration uwk&. For example, P\u02c6 Iuf& will pro-\nduce the ground-state band of an even-even system.

In the case of 182W, the ground, K50 band is\ncrossed by the @(624)9\/2,(615)11\/2#K51 neutron configura-\ntion at I514 and this band is then crossed by the\n@(633)7\/2,(624)9\/2#K51 neutron configuration which is\ncomposed of lower-V states and has a larger rotational align-\nment.

Although,\nwith a very large basis, the PSM results should be indepen-\ndent of the deformation used in the Nilsson potential, in\npractice a limited configuration space is employed and the\nresults do depend on the input deformation, especially for the\nsensitive regions where the single-particle distribution\naround the Fermi surface is a strongly varying function of\ndeformation. We do see that inclusion of a large hexadeca-\npole deformation favors the @7\/2,9\/2#K51 configuration.\nThis would explain the sharp backbending observed @5# in\n182W. It is noted @5# that the backbending in 182W is sharper\nthan in 180W and is somewhat puzzling since normally one\nwould expect that, with the filling of neutrons in the higher-\nV states, the backbending should be smoother. We would\nlike to mention that the oscillatory character of the interac-\ntion strength @18# can also lead to a sharper backbend in\n182W.\nIt is noted from Fig. 1 that the t band with the\n@(624)9\/2,(615)11\/2#K510 neutron configuration is almost\ndegenerate with the ground-state K50 band. The V decom-\nposition of this band is the same as @9\/2,11\/2#K51, but with\nthe individual V states added up. As expected, the unper-\nturbed bandheads I51 and 10 of the two bands are almost\nthe same, since the intrinsic Nilsson energies are identical for\nthe two bands. The t band with a large K-value depicts no\nsignature splitting and the lowest odd-spin states will origi-\nnate from this configuration for all spin values. As men-\ntioned in the Introduction, these high-K bands normally lie at\na higher-excitation energy relative to the K50 bands. How-ever, with the Fermi surface in the upper half of the intruder\nsubshell, these t bands compete with the low-K s bands.\nFuthermore, due to the very large difference in K quantum\nnumbers, there is no term in the Hamiltonian which can di-\nrectly couple the t band with the g and s bands, thus the t\nband remains unaffected by the configuration mixing, as dis-\ncussed later.\nThe band diagram for 180W shows the neutron\n@(633)7\/2,(624)9\/2#K51 band crossing the K50 g band at\nI510. The tilted neutron band @(633)7\/2,(624)9\/2#K58 lies\nhigher in energy as compared to the s and g bands, but it will\nbe shown later that the configuration mixing alters this or-\ndering. The band diagram for 178W contains more structures\nnear the yrast line. The neutron @(633)7\/2,(624)9\/2#K51\nband crosses the K50 band at I512, and this band is later\n~at I518! crossed by the neutron @(642)5\/2,(633)7\/2#K51\nband. The @(633)7\/2,(624)9\/2#K58 band lies higher in en-\nergy compared to both g and s bands. However, the theory\npredicts a low-lying K56 band formed by neutrons\n@(512)5\/2,(514)7\/2# . This band lies very low at the band-\nhead and is crossed by the @7\/2,9\/2#K58 band at I512 with\na very small crossing angle.\nThe PSM results after configuration mixing are compared\nwith the experimental data @6,5,15# in Fig. 2. The yrast con-\nfiguration is reproduced quite well for all the three nuclei at\nlower spins. However, at higher spins, there is some dis-\nagreement, increasing with spin. This can be understood by\nnoting that in our projected basis, we have configurations up\nto 4-quasiparticles only. The 6-quasiparticle configurations\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\n57 R29PROJECTED SHELL MODEL ANALYSIS OF TILTED ROTATIONare known to compete in these nuclei at about the excitation\nenergy of '4.5 MeV and the PSM results appear to deviate\nabove this energy.\nIn the case of 182W, the yrast states up to I510 are domi-\nnated by the K50 configuration. For I512, there is almost\nequal mixing of @9\/2,11\/2#K51 and K50 states, and for\nI514 and 16 the contribution of K51 is larger than K50.\nThe yrast I518 and 20 states are predominantly composed of\n@7\/2,9\/2#K51. The yrare I510 to 14 states have\n@9\/2,11\/2#K510 composition but then change character at\nhigher spins. In Fig. 2, we have followed each band with a\npredominant intrinsic configuration.\nThe t bands in Fig. 2 have almost no overlap with the g\nand s bands. There is no direct mixing between these bands\nwith the QQ interaction employed in the present work.\nTherefore, the backbending observed in the high-spin data of\n182W is due to crossing of the @9\/2,11\/2#K51 and\n@7\/2,9\/2#K51 s bands with the ground-state band. The yrast\nstates above I514 originate from these K51 configurations.\nIn the conventional picture the yrare states above the cross-\ning region are comprised of the K50 g-band configuration.\nHowever, in Fig. 2 it is observed that the yrare states up to\nI514 come from the t band, which is due to strong configu-\nration mixing ~repelling each other! between the g and the s\nbands. In the unperturbed picture in Fig. 1, the yrare I514\nstate has K50 g-band character. The interaction pushes up\nthe g band and makes it possible for the t band to form the\nyrare band.\nFor 180W, the yrast states up to I58 are mainly com-\nprised of the K50 configuration. For I510, the yrast state\nhas a large @7\/2,9\/2#K51 contribution and this increases\nwith increasing angular momentum. The yrare even-spin\nstates up to I516 and all the yrast odd-spin states have\nmainly @7\/2,9\/2#K58 composition. It is to be noted that be-\nfore the configuration mixing, the yrare states belong to\n@7\/2,9\/2#K51. However, the mixing between the g and the\n@7\/2,9\/2#K51 bands is even stronger than that in 182W and\nthis pushes the @7\/2,9\/2#K51, I58 state to higher energy.\nThe yrare states from I58 to 16 have mainly @7\/2,9\/2#K58\ncomposition. The I518, 20, and 22 yrare states have a strong\nmixing from the K51 state and the even-spin states above\nare mainly composed of this configuration. At present, our\ncalculation fails to reproduce the magnitude of the observed\nstaggering in the yrare band between the even and odd\nhigher spin states. Qualitatively, this staggering could be un-\nderstood as a consequence of interaction of the K58 band\nwith other low-K bands ~e.g., the g band!: the even-spin\nstates of the K58 band are pushed up by the interaction,\nwhile the odd spin states remain unperturbed ~there is no odd\nspin state from the g band to interact with!. This question has\nbeen addressed in a model calculation in Ref. @19#. To fur-\nther expose the deviation, a comparison of the staggering\npart of the K58 band in 180W for our calculation with the\ndata is shown in Fig. 3, for quantity of 12 @E(I11)\n2E(I21)#. It is seen that our calculations produce the right\nstaggering phase, but the amplitude is too small as compared\nto the data. In addition, the theoretical results underestimate\nthe alignment of the K58 band.\nThe even-spin yrast states for 178W up to I58 mainly\narise from the K50 g-band configuration, from I58 to I514 they are a mixture of K50 and @(633)7\/2,(624)9\/2#K51\nstates and from I516 and above they are highly\nmixed and arise from @(633)7\/2,(624)9\/2#K51 and\n@(642)5\/2,(633)7\/2#K51. The yrare states up to I510\norginate from the @(512)5\/2,(514)7\/2#K56 neutron con-\nfiguration. If we follow this high-K configuration, it has a\nstrong mixture with the neutron @(633)7\/2,(624)9\/2#K58\nt-band structure before and after their band crossing ~see Fig.\n1!, and it eventually becomes dominated by the\n@7\/2,9\/2#K58 component. However, the yrare structure is\nchanged to the superpositions of K50, @7\/2,9\/2#K51 and\n@5\/2,7\/2#K51 configurations after I512, as we clearly see\nin Fig. 2. We would like to mention that the data @15# also\nshow a dipole band with bandhead spin I56 and a clear\ncrossing of two bands at I512.\nOur discussion of t bands has so far been concentrated on\nneutron configurations. By adding two protons, i.e., going up\nto the osmium isotopes, the proton Fermi level also lies be-\ntween high-K orbitals with K59\/2 and 11\/2. It is thus very\ninteresting to see how the proton 2-qp high-K band competes\nwith the neutron high-K bands discussed earlier. Bands for\n184Os are calculated with the same parameters as for the\ntungsten isotopes except for the deformation (\u00ab250.210 and\n\u00ab450.053 @17#!. In Fig. 4, the band diagram is plotted in the\nupper half, while results after band mixing are given in the\nlower part. Indeed, the proton @~514!9\/2,~505!11\/2#K510\nband is found lower than the neutron @~624!9\/2,~615!11\/2#K\n510 band, and is nearly degenerate with the g band. Al-\nthough 184Os has the same neutron number as 182W, due to\nsmaller deformation the neutron @~633!7\/2,~624!9\/2#K58\nband is also predicted lying low and can compete with the\nneutron K510 band. In addition, a K511 4-qp band, being a\ncombination of the proton K510 and neutron K51 structure,\nsharply dives down at high spins. For these 6 lowest bands,\nbesides the g band with a neutron K51 band crossing, we\nmay focus on another two interesting bandcrossings, i.e., the\ncrossing between the neutron K58 and K510 bands at I512\nand the one between the proton K510 and the K511 4-qp\nband at I515. After band mixing, the partners are pushed up\nor down. The neutron K510 band is strongly mixed with the\nK58 band at the crossing region and has more K58 com-\nponent afterwards. The proton K510 band is the yrare band\nFIG. 3. Comparison for the staggering part of the K58 band in\n180W for our calculation with the data ~spins in units of \\!.

By the strong interaction with the\n4-qp band, it is pushed down at I515 and becomes the yrare\nband again. Actually, this band becomes dominated by the\n4-qp component after I515. It would be interesting to ob-\nserve these predicted phenomena in a future experiment.\nFIG. 4. Predictions for 184Os. The upper panel shows the band\ndiagram and the lower panel contains the results after configuration\nmixing ~spin in units of \\!. In the lower panel, the K58 and 10\nneutron t bands are both shown by dashed-dotted lines since they\ninteract strongly. The two-quasiproton band with K510 and the\nfour-quasiparticle band with K511 also interact strongly and both\nare shown by full lines.A question that remains to be explored adequately is the\ndegree of mixing of the high-K t configuration into the yrast\nband. This has potentially important consequences for the\nunderstanding of anomalous K-isomer decays by highly\nK-forbidden transitions @4#. However, the extent of the t-\nband\/yrast band mixing, here found to be very small, is sen-\nsitive to the model space and the Hamiltonian employed.\nWhile the effect on level energies may not be significant, the\nevaluation of transition matrix elements requires further\nwork.\nIn conclusion, we have studied the near-yrast band struc-\ntures in tungsten isotopes with focus on the tilted bands that\nbecome energetically favored with the Fermi surface in the\nupper half of the intruder subshell. We have demonstrated\nhow the tilted bands can appear at low energy by angular\nmomentum projection and configuration mixing, within a\nmodel going beyond the usual mean-field approach. The ob-\nserved backbending in these nuclei comes from the normal s-\nband crossing. However, due to a strong interaction between\nthe g and s bands, the two bands repel after the configuration\nmixing and the normal yrare band lies at a higher energy. In\nconstrast, the t band has almost no coupling with these bands\nand remains largely unaffected after the mixing. This ex-\nplains the observation of the t band as the yrare band in the\nexperimental data of 180,182W. Finally, a complex and inter-\nesting structure is predicted for 184Os.\nThe Joint Institute for Heavy Ion Research has as member\ninstitutions, the University of Tennessee, Vanderbilt Univer-\nsity, and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory; it is supported\nby the member institutions and by the U.S. Department of\nEnergy through Contract No. DE\u2013AS05\u201376ER04936 with\nthe University of Tennessee.
