While recent breakthroughs like the\ndemonstration of a high-speed optical modulator in Si \u0001Ref.\n1\u0002 bring the concept of transition from electrical to optical\ninterconnects closer to realization, the base for any silicon\nphotonics, namely, a group IV laser source, still has to be\ndeveloped. Up to now, the only lasing devices demonstrated\nin Si are a Raman laser2 and Si-based impurity lasers,3 which\nessentially lack the advantages associated with the silicon\nsystem by requiring an external pump laser source. For sili-\ncon as an indirect semiconductor the concept of infrared\nemitters based on quantum cascade \u0001QC\u0002 heterostructures,\nwhich is very successfully applied to III-V material systems,\nconstitutes a promising approach towards a SiGe infrared\nlaser. But while infrared electroluminescence \u0001EL\u0002 of various\nwavelengths has been demonstrated for p-type SiGe quan-\ntum cascade structures,4\u20136 lasing has yet to be achieved. The\nbuildup of population inversion in order to achieve lasing\nfundamentally depends on the relaxation lifetime of the ex-\ncited energy level of the lasing transition. Therefore the mea-\nsurement and optimization of the intersubband relaxation\ntime constitutes a key issue for the realization of a Si cascade\nlaser source. The intersubband hole relaxation time for tran-\nsitions below the optical phonon energy \u0001Si\u2013Si: 58 meV, Ge\u2013\nGe: 36 meV\u0002 is significantly larger than 10 ps and therefore\nis experimentally well accessible.7 The lifetimes for energies\nabove the optical phonon energies are smaller than 1 ps.\nThus so far experiments suffered from a lack of time\nresolution8 or from hole heating requiring subtraction of\nheating contributions in order to gain a value for the relax-\nation time.9\nIn this work we report the first direct measurement of the\nexcited heavy hole \u0001HH\u0002 lifetime in the femtosecond regime\nfor quantum well \u0001QW\u0002 transition energies above the optical\nphonon energy. Time resolved measurements were per-\nformed using the free electron laser \u0001FEL\u0002 FELIX at FOM\nRijnhuizen. FELIX provides micropulses with full widths at\nhalf maximum down to 280 fs and peak powers of 100 MW.\nThe micropulse repetition rate is 25 MHz, five macropulses\nof 7 \u0001s duration are provided per second. The FEL power\ncan be reduced to 33 dB by attenuators.\nThe sample was grown pseudomorphically on a Si \u0003100\u0004\nsubstrate. The active region contains ten periods of nomi-\nnally the same five coupled SiGe QWs, for that QC EL was\nobserved recently.4 The periods are separated by 500 \u00c5 un-\ndoped Si barriers in order to suppress dark current. A detailed\ndescription of the sample investigated in this work is given\nin Ref. 10. In Fig. 1\u0001d\u0002, the band structure of this sample as\ncalculated according to Ref. 11 is shown for the HH, light\nhole, and split-off band edges. The absolute squares of the\nwave functions relevant for this work are shown at their re-\nspective energy values. The HH1-HH2 transition energy of\nthe deepest well 1 \u000139 \u00c5, 42% Ge\u0002 is calculated to be\n160 meV. Experimentally, this transition energy was deter-\nmined by voltage modulated waveguide transmission.

Figure 1\u0001a\u0002 shows that a clear peak at the calcu-\nlated HH1-HH2 transition energy is observed. The final HH2\nstate of this transition is strongly confined. Thus the HH1-\nHH2 transition of the deepest QW 1 was not observed in our\nprevious photocurrent \u0001PC\u0002 experiments,10 in which low in-\ntensity radiation from a globar was used to excite the sample.\nHowever, since in well 1 the HH1, HH2, and the onset of the\ncontinuum states are nearly equally spaced in energy, PC can\nbe generated by two-photon processes. Figure 1 shows the\nresults of PC experiments using the intense laser radiation of\nFELIX. For two different bias voltages, Figs. 1\u0001b\u0002 and 1\u0001c\u0002\nshow a clear two-photon PC signal resonantly enhanced at\nthe HH1-HH2 transition energy for TM polarization.\nIn order to verify that a nonlinear absorption process is\nresponsible for the PC signal at the HH1-HH2 energy, the\ndependence of the PC peak maximum on the FEL micropulse\nenergy was measured for TM polarized radiation. For pulse\nenergies smaller than 3\u000210\u22122 \u0001J the results presented in\nFig. 2 show a clear superlinear dependence of the peak maxi-\nmum on the pulse energy typical for multiphoton processes.\nFor pulse energies in excess of 5\u000210\u22122 \u0001J, a saturation of\nthe PC signal is observed.\nIn order to understand the power dependence of the PC\nsignal over the whole range of micropulse energies as well as\nthe dynamics of the state occupancies, the response of the\nsystem to a laser pulse resonant with the HH1-HH2 transi-\ntion was simulated using a density matrix \u0001DM\u0002\napproach.12,13 The result of the DM calculations is shown by\nthe solid line in Fig. 2. The details of the DM calculations are\nbeyond the scope of this letter and will be published in a\nforthcoming publication.14 The simulation is in very good\nagreement with the measurement over two orders of magni-\ntude of the exciting power. The calculations show that for\nlow excitation intensities HH2 is only weakly populated by\nthe pulse, most carriers remain in HH1. Therefore the con-\ntinuum occupation depends quadratically on the intensity. As\nthe peak intensity gets higher, the HH1-HH2 transition\nreaches bleaching \u0001i.e., the HH1 and HH2 populations be-\ncome equal\u0002 within the pulse time, and therefore the con-\ntinuum occupation and the PC become linearly dependent on\nthe excitation intensity. For even higher intensities, the occu-\npations of HH1, HH2, and continuum become comparable,\nthus the transition to the continuum becomes bleached and\nthe PC saturates.\nIn order to determine the HH2-HH1 relaxation time,\nwhich has been reported to be mainly determined by optical\nphonon deformation potential scattering,9,15 PC pump-pump\nexperiments were performed. The pump-pump setup is\nshown in the inset of Fig. 2. The FEL beam with a wave-\nlength of 7.9 \u0001m enters the optical setup in TE polarization\nand is split by a beam splitter \u0001B1\u0002. The polarization of one\nof the beams is turned by 90\u00b0 into TM polarization \u0001PR2\u0002.\nThe beam remaining in TE polarization is reflected by a\nmovable mirror \u0001R1\u0002 allowing to adjust the delay between\nTE and TM pulses on a femtosecond scale. Before being\ncoupled into the sample waveguide, the beams are made col-\nlinear again by the use of a second beam splitter \u0001B2\u0002. The\nintegral PC through the variably biased sample originating\nfrom the delayed TE and TM micropulses is measured as a\nfunction of the delay. The advantage of performing PC mea-\nsurements in comparison with pump-probe experiments lies\nin its much higher sensitivity. In addition, major setup prob-\nlems arising for pump-probe transmission experiments in\nwaveguide configuration, like distinguishing between the\nparallel pump and probe beams, are avoided. The cross po-\nlarization of the FEL beams breaks the symmetry of the ex-\nperiment with respect to the sign of the delay and allows an\nunambiguous identification of decay processes even if the\ndecay time constant is close to the time resolution of the\nsetup. Furthermore it prevents interference of the two beams.\nThe results of the pump-pump measurements after sub-\ntracting a background that corresponds to the PC signal for\nlarge delays are presented in Fig. 3. The curves show a pro-\nnounced asymmetry with respect to the sign of the delay,\nwhich is due to the strong polarization dependence of the\ntransition involved. For negative delays in Fig. 3, the TM\npolarized pulse is the first to interact with the sample.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\npolarization, the HH1-HH2 transition is allowed, and thus a\nnonequilibrium population of the HH2 state will be excited.\nThis nonequilibrium HH2 occupation decays exponentially\nwith the time constant \u000310. From the HH2 state, holes can be\nexcited to the continuum also in TE polarization. Therefore,\nif the TE pulse hits the structure before the HH2 carriers\nhave relaxed, the integral PC increases proportionally to the\nresidual holes in the HH2 state. Thus the measured decay of\nthe integral PC as a function of the pulse delay directly\nmonitors the HH2 lifetime. Since the HH1-HH2 selection\nrules prohibit a HH2 population generated by the TE pulse,\nthe HH2 relaxation cannot be observed if the TE pulse ar-\nrives first \u0001positive delays in Fig. 3\u0002 and an asymmetry with\nrespect to the pulse order as observed in the experimental\nresults. The fast decaying increase of the PC signal between\n0 and 1.5 ps in Fig. 3 results from the overlap of the TE and\nTM pulses, and thus indicates the time resolution of the ex-\nperimental setup. An exponential fit reveals a HH2-HH1 re-\nlaxation time of 550 fs, which is significantly longer than the\ntime resolution of the measurement system. Figure 3 also\nshows the simulated results for pump-pump experiments.14\nAs shown by the broken line in Fig. 3, our simulation\naccurately describes the experiment. We want to point out\nthat the same parameters as used for simulating the depen-\ndence of the PC peak maximum on the micropulse energy\nwere used in the simulation of the pump-pump results. The\nexperiment was performed for several bias voltages, how-\never, no influence of the bias voltage on the HH2-HH1 re-\nlaxation time could be observed. From our experiments, a\nsignificantly longer relaxation time \u0001550 fs\u0002 than reported in\nRef. 9 \u0001250 fs\u0002 results, where a contribution of hole heating\nhad to be deconvoluted in order to gain this value. In our\nexperiment, such heating effects would only enter via a time\ndependent development of the distribution function for the\nexcited HH2 population into a Fermi-Dirac distribution de-\nscribed by an elevated hole temperature and a HH2 quasi-\nFermi level. Calculations indicate a decrease of the HH2-\ncontinuum absorption at the pump-pump wavelength of\n7.9 \u0001m as a consequence of heating. Thus, a deviation from\nexponential decay and an underestimation of the HH2 relax-\nation time would result due to heating. However, we want to\nemphasize that due to the low excitation intensity sufficient\nfor our experiments, no deviations from an exponential HH2\ndecay could be observed. Also in previous work, under the\nhigher intensities required for pump-probe absorption deter-\nminations of lifetime, only the heating of the HH1 ground\nstate distribution was subtracted in the analysis and the in-\nfluence of a hot HH2 excited state distribution was\nneglected.9\nThe excellent agreement of measured and simulated re-\nsults for both types of experiments with one set of param-\neters strongly supports the interpretation of our data. The\nextracted HH2-HH1 subband relaxation time \u000310 is thus\nhighly reliable, for it is consistent with the results of both\ntypes of experiments. To our knowledge this work presents\nthe first direct measurement of the intersubband hole relax-\nation time for transitions above the optical phonon energy.\nAdditionally, femtosecond time resolution has been achieved\nhere for the first time in an active, electrically biased SiGe\nstructure. Thus our results constitute a key step in the design\nand dynamic simulation of SiGe QC laser structures.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support by the\nStichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie \u0001FOM\u0002\nin providing the required beam time on FELIX and highly\nappreciate the skillful assistance by the FELIX staff.
