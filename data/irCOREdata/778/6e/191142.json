We find no new\nevidence supporting the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole in this ULX.\nKey words: X-rays: galaxies - X-rays: binaries - Black hole physics\n1 INTRODUCTION\nAlthough ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) were detected and\nstudied by Einstein (e.g. Fabbiano 1989), ROSAT (e.g. Roberts\n& Warwick 2000; Colbert & Ptak 2002; Liu & Bregman 2005)\nand ASCA (e.g. Makishima et al. 2000), the Chandra and XMM-\nNewton observatories have provided us with the clearest view to\ndate of these extraordinary X-ray sources (see e.g. Miller & Colbert\n2004 for a review of the early results from these missions). How-\never, despite the advances afforded by these missions over their\npredecessors, a concise determination of the underlying nature of\nULXs has remained stubbornly elusive.\nOne certainty is that the high observed luminosities of ULXs\n(LX > 1039 erg s\u22121) cannot be explained by stellar-mass black\nholes radiating isotropically below their Eddington limit. As this\nluminosity limit is directly proportional to the mass of the accret-\ning object, the simplest solution is to turn to a new class of larger\nblack holes, that we now refer to as \u201cintermediate-mass\u201d black\nholes (IMBHs; Colbert & Mushotzky 1999), with typical masses\nin the 102 \u2212 104 M\u2299 range. Such objects are certainly enticing as\nthey would fill in a gap in the known mass range of black holes,\n\u22c6 E-mail: tro@star.le.ac.uk\nthat currently falls between \u223c 20 and \u223c 105 M\u2299 (i.e. between the\nstellar-mass objects observed in our own Galaxy, and the supermas-\nsive black holes present in many galactic nuclei). However, there\nis not a single piece of evidence that currently establishes beyond\ndoubt that any individual ULX contains an IMBH. A combination\nof factors - most notably its extreme luminosity - make M82 X-1\nthe best current candidate (e.g. Portegies-Zwart et al. 2004). Evi-\ndence that other bright ULXs contain IMBHs is provided largely\nby the detection of a soft excess in their X-ray spectrum, that can\nbe fitted with an accretion disc spectrum with an inner disc temper-\nature of \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.3 keV, suggestive of the presence of an IMBH\n(Miller et al. 2003; Miller, Fabian & Miller 2004).\nHowever, this last spectral interpretation has recently been\nchallenged by new spectral data and modelling that questions the\nnecessity for IMBHs to power even the most luminous ULXs (e.g.\nStobbart, Roberts & Wilms 2006; hereafter SRW06). This com-\nplements the circumstantial evidence from multi-wavelength data -\nin particular the over-abundance of ULXs found in galaxies host-\ning very active star formation - that argues against IMBHs consti-\ntuting a large fraction of the ULX population (King 2004). Addi-\ntionally, the break in the X-ray luminosity function of ULXs at \u223c\n2\u00d71040 erg s\u22121 (Grimm, Gilfanov & Sunyaev 2003) is difficult to\nreconcile with black holes larger than\u223c 100 M\u2299 contributing any-\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS\n2 T. P. Roberts et al.\nthing but a small minority of the ULX population. These arguments\ntherefore support a demography in which the majority of the ULX\npopulation are a type of stellar-mass (\u223c 10 M\u2299, though plausibly\nup to a few times larger) black hole X-ray binary that can match\nor even exceed its Eddington limit. Models for achieving super-\nEddington luminosities from these systems include the \u201cslim\u201d disc\nmodel (e.g. Watarai, Mizuno & Mineshige 2001), radiation-presure\ndominated discs (Begelman 2002), mildly-anisotropic radiation\npatterns from sources emitting at or below the Eddington limit\n(King et al. 2001) and relativistic beaming (Ko\u00a8rding, Falcke &\nMarkoff 2002).\nWhilst concerted efforts have been made to understand the na-\nture of ULXs via X-ray spectroscopy and multi-wavelength follow-\nup, variability characteristics (particularly in harness with spec-\ntroscopy) have not yet been as widely utilised. Yet, as RXTE has\nso spectacularly demonstrated, the key to understanding accreting\nsources is to study changes in their behaviour over a wide variety\nof timescales (cf. McClintock & Remillard 2006 for a review of\nthe properties of Galactic black hole binaries). In fact, variability\nmeasurements over many different timescales could provide key\nmeasurements for understanding the nature of ULXs.\nFor example, the detection of a 3:2 ratio twin-peak high-\nfrequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at \u223c 1 Hz frequency\nfrom a ULX would imply the presence of an IMBH (Abromow-\nicz et al. 2004; though we note that scaling arguments based on\ndetections in Galactic black holes show that even a mission with\nthe anticipated capabilities of XEUS is likely to struggle to detect\nsuch a signature). The detection of low-frequency QPOs may be\nless revealing, though several authors have estimated the mass of\nthe black hole in M82 X-1 based on the frequency of a QPO detec-\ntion, amongst other factors (e.g. Fiorito & Titarchuk 2004; Dewan-\ngen, Titarchuk & Griffiths 2006; Mucciarelli et al. 2006). A simpler\nargument based on this QPO, which is the best-detected example\nof this phenomenon in a ULX to date, is that its presence argues\nagainst geometric beaming of the X-ray flux in M82 X-1, imply-\ning that an IMBH is likely to be present (Strohmayer & Mushotzky\n2003; though see Kaaret, Simet & Lang 2006b for caveats).\nA second possible diagnostic for ULXs from short-timescale\nvariability measurements is the shape of the fluctuation Power\nSpectral Density (PSD). In particular, the characteristic frequency\nof breaks in the PSD slope can be used to infer masses based on\nthe assumption of a direct scaling of properties between Galactic\nblack holes and AGNs (see e.g. Uttley et al. 2002). Cropper et al.\n(2004) used this technique to support the case that NGC 4559 X7\nis a > 1000 M\u2299 IMBH (though they discuss alternatives). In con-\ntrast, Soria et al. (2004) examined the PSD of NGC 5408 X-1 dur-\ning a flaring phase and from the break frequency and slopes either\nside of the break suggest a mass \u223c 100 M\u2299. Finally, Goad et al.\n(2006) used the lack of variability power in a deep, high signal-to-\nnoise XMM-Newton observation of Ho II X-1 to suggest an upper\nlimit on its black hole mass of 100 M\u2299. However, the calculation\nof PSDs is not always practical for ULXs given that as a class they\ndo not tend to show much short-timescale variability. For example,\nSwartz et al.

In particular,\nthe detection of periodicity could provide a view of the orbital char-\nacteristics of the binary system underlying the ULX. Perhaps the\nmost dramatic form this periodicity could take is eclipsing of the\nX-ray emission by the secondary star; interestingly, this could also\nbe an indicator of the black hole mass, with stellar-mass black holes\nfar more likely to show eclipses than IMBHs (Pooley & Rappaport\n2005). However, known eclipsing ULXs remain rare \u2013 David et al.\n(2005) report a candidate in NGC 3379 with a 8-10 hr period, and\na second candidate with a 7.5-hr period has long been known in the\nCircinus galaxy (Bauer et al. 2001) (though this latter object may\ninstead be a foreground AM Her system; Weisskopf et al. 2004).\nOther reports of periods mainly rely on apparent periodic flux max-\nima in the light curves of the ULXs (for example Liu et al. 2002;\nKaaret, Simet & Lang 2006a), though these detections are often\nbased on very limited data (coverage of 2 - 4 times the suggested\nperiod only). The ambiguities in interpreting such data is high-\nlighted by the case of M74 X-1 (CXOU J013651.1+154547), which\nwas observed to undergo strong, relatively regular flaring behaviour\nduring Chandra and XMM-Newton observations in 2001\/2002. Liu\net al. (2005) interpret this as quasi-periodic behaviour, and from\nthis and the X-ray spectrum suggest a mass of \u223c (2 \u2212 20) \u00d7 103\nM\u2299, whereas Krauss et al. (2005) note that the behaviour resembles\nGalactic microquasars and suggest that the flaring could be related\nto a relativisitic jet aligned with our line-of-sight.\nThe general lack of short-timescale variability exhibited by\nULXs is to some degree extended to longer timescales by their per-\nsistent brightness. Indeed, many bright ULXs first observed by Ein-\nstein and subsequently re-observed by the following missions have\nremained active for more than 20 years with only modest flux vari-\nations between epochs (factors < 4 over \u223c 20 years, e.g. Roberts\net al. 2004). Such persistence is reminiscent of Galactic high-mass\nX-ray binaries with black hole primaries. Interestingly, Kalogera\net al. (2004) predict that accretion from massive stars onto both\nstellar-mass black holes and IMBHs will appear reasonably persis-\ntent, with the key diagnostic being that IMBH systems will show\ntransient behaviour on timescales of tens of years1 No such com-\nplete turn-off has been seen so far from a famous ULX. Indeed,\nthe majority of well-studied transient ULXs to date are likely to be\nsimilar in nature to known Galactic sources (Ghosh et al. 2006a;\nMukai et al. 2005; Bauer & Pietsch 2005), though the spectrally\nhard, very luminous ULX close to the centre of NGC 3628 stands\nout as an IMBH candidate that has shown possible transient be-\nhaviour (Strickland et al. 2001).\nA final temporal diagnostic is the spectral behaviour of ULXs,\nparticularly by comparison to the behaviour of Galactic black hole\nX-ray binaries. ASCA observations of the ULXs in IC 342 iden-\ntified spectra that apparently transited between low\/hard (power-\nlaw dominated) and high\/soft (accretion disc dominated) states in\nobservations separated by 7 years (Kubota et al. 2001), which is\nsimilar to the most common behaviour in Galactic systems. How-\never, many subsequent studies have highlighted ULXs that appear\nto show a contrary behaviour, in that they spectrally harden as their\nflux increases (e.g. Fabbiano et al. 2003; Dewangan et al. 2004).\nFabbiano et al. (2003) note that this may indicate that ULXs are in\na particularly high accretion rate state, though Jenkins et al.

NGC\n5204 X-1 is one of the brightest nearby ULXs with historical ob-\nserved fluxes in the range \u223c 0.7\u2212 2\u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (0.5 \u2013\n8 keV), converting to luminosities of the order 2\u22126\u00d71039 erg s\u22121\nfor a distance of d = 4.8 Mpc (Roberts et al. 2004). It is most no-\ntable for possessing stellar optical counterparts identified from its\naccurate Chandra position (Roberts et al. 2001; Goad et al. 2002),\none of which was subsequently identified as a B0 Ib supergiant and\nsuggested to be the actual counterpart due to UV spectral peculiari-\nties consistent with some Galactic X-ray binaries (Liu, Bregman &\nSeitzer 2004). Initial short Chandra observations were hampered\nby low-level pile-up, but did reveal a steep power-law X-ray spec-\ntrum (Roberts et al. 2001, 2004). Subsequent XMM-Newton obser-\nvations then revealed a spectral soft excess that might be interpreted\nas evidence of an IMBH accretion disc, though other spectral mod-\nels not requiring the presence of an IMBH also fitted well to the\ndata (Roberts et al. 2005; SRW06). In this paper we return to the\nissue of the nature of this ULX, as constrained by our X-ray moni-\ntoring campaign.\n2 THE MONITORING CAMPAIGN\nPrevious observations of NGC 5204 X-1 have indicated that its flux\nvaries by factors of \u223c 3 over a baseline of years, but that little\nor no measureable variability was seen over timescales of minutes\nto a few hours (e.g. Roberts et al. 2004). Hence this monitoring\ncampaign was designed to provide an indication of whether this\nULX varies on timescales intermediate to those already probed, i.e.\ntimescales of days to weeks. The Chandra X-ray observatory is\nthe best choice for such a programme primarily due to its schedul-\ning flexibility, combined with the spectral imaging capabilities of\nACIS-S. The variability was investigated by a sequence of 11 ob-\nservations spanning a period of two months (Table 1). An initial\nmoderately-deep (50-ks) observation began the sequence, provid-\ning information on variability over the course of a \u223c 14 hour inter-\nval. This was followed by a sequence of five short (5-ks) follow-up\nobservations spaced at \u223c 3 day intervals, to investigate variabil-\nity over the course of days, then a further five (5-ks) observations\nspaced at\u223c 10 day intervals to look at the variability on timescales\nof weeks. We summarise the observation details in Table 1, show-\ning the exact start times and live-time corrected exposures. We\nalso show an estimate of the mean Chandra ACIS-S count rate\nfrom NGC 5204 X-1 for each observation, which clearly demon-\nstrates that the source flux is indeed varying over the day-to-week\ntimescales examined.\nA second aim of this programme was to characterise any spec-\ntral variability over the timescales probed. However, as Roberts\net al. (2004) demonstrated, even employing the ACIS-S 1\n8\nsubar-\nray mode in an attempt to mitigate pile-up was not fully success-\nful for previous Chandra ACIS-S observations of NGC 5204 X-1.\nWhen the ULX was located on-axis, and was at its higher flux state\n(> 0.4 count s\u22121), detectable pile-up effects were still evident in\nits X-ray spectrum. We therefore configured each observation such\nthat NGC 5204 X-1 was located a distance of 4 arcminutes off-axis,\ndisplaced along the ACIS-S3 chip such that it remained in the mid-\ndle of the spatial region covered by the 1\n8\nsubarray (i.e. an offset of\n\u2206Y = \u22124 arcmin in detector coordinates). The degradation of the\nChandra point spread function at 4 arcminutes off-axis results in a\n50% encircled energy radius of \u223c 1.5 arcseconds, which compares\nto \u223c 0.5 arcseconds on-axis. This is sufficient to ensure that any\nremaining pile-up is mitigated to manageable levels (< 4%).\nTable 1.

Full light curve for the monitoring campaign. We show the mean\n0.5 \u2013 8 keV band count rate per observation, and use the standard deviation\non this count rate to represent the intrinsic variability per epoch.\nThe resulting data were reduced using standard tools within\nthe CIAO 3.0 software suite, and version 2.23 of the Chandra Cal-\nibration Database. Pulse invariant spectra were extracted for each\nobservation using the tool DMEXTRACT and response matrices and\nancillary response functions (ARFs) were computed. Due to the\nbuild-up of the contaminant layer on the ACIS optical blocking fil-\nter, the ARFs were corrected using Alexey Vikhlinin\u2019s tool COR-\nRARF, now incorporated as a standard part of the CIAO spectral\nextraction.\nIn order to assess the validity of these products in light of\ncalibration improvements made publicly available since our ini-\ntial reduction, we reprocessed data from the 50-ks observation us-\ning CIAO 3.3 and the calibration database (CALDB) 3.2.1, and ex-\ntracted new spectra. Minor differences in the response functions\nwere found, primarily below 0.5 keV, with the functions being\nequivalent above 1 keV. Given that the impact to data in the 0.5-1\nkeV range was minimal, we elected not to reprocess the data pre-\nsented herein.\n3 TEMPORAL VARIABILITY\nWe present the 2-month monitoring light curve of NGC 5204 X-\n1 in Figure 1. The mean observed count rate of the ULX clearly\nvaries by as much as factors of \u223c 5 (in the 0.5 - 8 keV Chan-\ndra bandpass) between the observations, and the variations are sta-\ntistically highly significant (a \u03c72 fit against the hypothesis of a con-\nstant count rate, set to the mean count rate for the eleven observa-\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n4 T.

Most\ninterestingly, the source appears to have upper and lower thresh-\nolds that are not exceeded (albeit within the very limited sampling\nof this programme), confining the flux measurements to between\n\u223c 0.1 and 0.5 count s\u22121. In fact, these limits do not appear to have\nbeen exceeded throughout the historical record of observations of\nthis source (cf. Roberts et al. 2004, Figure 6(f), where the extreme\nflux points are both from Chandra ACIS-S data, and correspond to\ncount rates of \u223c 0.41 and \u223c 0.16 count s\u22121).\nThe light curve, though sparsely sampled, does not betray any\nobvious periodic signature. This is particularly interesting for NGC\n5204 X-1 where a positive identification of the secondary star in\nthis system as a B0 Ib supergiant, and the assumption of Roche\nlobe overflow, leads to firm predictions of the orbital period of be-\ntween \u223c 200 \u2212 300 hours for a wide range of primary black hole\nmasses (3 \u2212 1000 M\u2299; Liu et al. 2004). Our \u223c 59 day baseline\ncovers between 5 and 7 cycles of these possible orbital periods. We\nhave searched for possible hidden periodic signals by deriving a\nLomb-Scargle periodogram from the data. A visual inspection of\nthe periodogram suggested possible periodic signals of \u223c 10 and\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\nChandra monitoring observations of NGC 5204 X-1 5\nFigure 3. The power spectral density of the 50-ks exposure. It was calcu-\nlated by dividing the light curve into 64 segments of 128 points, and the\nFFT of each segment was computed and averaged to produce the plot. Er-\nrors were computed in the standard fashion from the dispersion of the 64\ndata points within each frequency bin.

We further investigated these\nsignals by fitting a model composed of a sinusoidal function plus a\nconstant component to the lightcurve, and did indeed find a best-fit\nto the data at \u223c 10 days. However this fit produced a \u03c72 statistic\nof 27.4 for 7 degrees of freedom (dof), which has a null hypothesis\nprobability of only 3 \u00d7 10\u22124, hence there is very little chance of\nthis being a true periodic signal. The fit for a 16-day period was\neven worse (\u03c72\/dof = 39.5\/7). We conclude that there is little or no\nevidence for periodicity in the X-ray emission from this dataset.\nIn Figure 2 we show the eleven individual lightcurves at 500-\ns resolution, plotted on a convenient scale for direct comparison.\nAn inspection by eye reveals that as one looks at shorter timescales\nthe amplitude of variability in this source is apparently less. That is\nto say, during the 50-ks observation clear trends are visible, start-\ning with a diminution in count rate from \u223c 0.3 count s\u22121 in the\nfirst 5 ks to \u223c 0.15 count s\u22121 after \u223c 30 ks, followed by a slight\nbrightening to \u223c 0.2 count s\u22121 for the remainder of the obser-\nvation. However, trends and\/or large amplitude variations are less\nvisible within the shorter follow-up observations. We performed\nstandard statistical tests to check for significant intrinsic variability\n(i.e. a \u03c72 test against the hypothesis of a constant count rate for\ndata binned to 100 or 200 second resolution, and a Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test at the full 0.74104 s temporal resolution of the ACIS-\nS3 1\n8\nsubarray), and found that the only observation showing highly\nsignificant variability was indeed the 50-ks look (sequence number\n600307, \u226b 10\u03c3 significance in both tests). Only one other obser-\nvation showed variability at > 3\u03c3 significance, namely 600315 (at\nT + 39.2 days) that was significant at the \u223c 4\u03c3 level according to\nthe K-S test (though, in contrast, the \u03c72 test showed a significance\n< 2\u03c3 for this observation). There was no strong evidence of any\nshort-term variability intrinsic to the data in any other observation.\nThe increase in intrinsic variability over longer timescales\nis typical of a source showing a red noise dominated fluctuation\npower spectral density (PSD).

However, the data for this potential red noise\ncomponent are so poor that we are unable to constrain any possible\nmeasurement of the power-law slope characterising this component\nat the 90% level. We note that as the variability increases to factors\nup to \u223c 5 over time scales of \u223c 3 days the putative red noise\nspectrum should continue down to, and become more apparent at,\nfrequencies longer than those covered in the 50-ks observation.\nWe have also investigated whether the broad spectral form\nof the ULX alters during our monitoring campaign by examining\nspectral hardness ratios calculated from the data. We binned the\ndata into 1-ks intervals and segregated it into three energy bands, a\n0.3 \u2013 1 keV soft (S) band, a 1 \u2013 2 keV medium (M ) band, and a 2\n\u2013 8 keV hard (H) band. We then calculated our hardness ratios as\nHR1 = (M \u2212S)\/(M +S) and HR2 = (H \u2212M)\/(H +M), with\nerrors on the hardness ratios calculated as per Ciliegi et al. (1997).\nAn initial examination of the energy-segregated lightcurves\nsuggested that there may be spectral variations as the total flux of\nthe source changes. We investigated this further by comparing the\nhardness ratios to the total count rate of NGC 5204 X-1, which we\nshow here in Fig. 4. There does indeed appear to be a trend over\nthe course of the campaign, with the ULX appearing to be rela-\ntively soft in its lowest flux states, and to harden significantly as its\nflux increases. This appears to be the case for both hardness ratios.\nRemarkably this behaviour appears contrary to the classic low\/hard\nto high\/soft state transitions commonly seen in Galactic black hole\nbinaries though, as we noted earlier, similar behaviour has been\nobserved before in other ULXs. We quantify this relationship in\nTable 2, where we split the data into three broad bins based on\nthe total count rate, and calculate a weighted mean of the hardness\nratio values within that count rate range. In the softer of the two ra-\ntios, HR1, we see that the average source spectrum hardens over all\nthree bins. However, the average HR2 value is consistent between\nthe two brighter count rate bins, and only significantly softer in the\nfaintest bin. We investigate the nature of these spectral variations,\nand their dependence on the brightness of NGC 5204 X-1, in the\nnext section.\n4 SPECTRAL VARIABILITY\nSpectral data were extracted in an elliptical aperture, with major\nand minor axes of \u223c 7.8 and \u223c 4.3 arcseconds respectively, de-\nsigned to encompass the full Chandra point spread function for\nX-ray photons from NGC 5204 X-1 at \u223c 4 arcminutes off-axis.\nBackground data were extracted in an elliptical annulus, centered\non the ULX and with inner and outer axial dimensions of 1 and 4\ntimes the source extraction ellipse axes respectively. The spectral\ndata were grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin, to ensure \u03c72\nstatistics are valid.

The errors quoted through-\nout the analysis are 90% errors for one interesting parameter unless\notherwise stated.\n4.1 The X-ray spectrum from the 50-ks observation\nWe began our spectral analysis by examining the full spectral data\nset for NGC 5204 X-1 from the initial 50-ks observation. In this\nand the subsequent analysis we fitted two absorption columns: a\nGalactic foreground absorber set to the line-of-sight in the direction\nof NGC 5204 (1.5 \u00d7 1020 atom cm\u22122; Stark et al. 1992), and an\nadditional absorption column presumably located along the line-of-\nsight in NGC 5204, or in the local vicinity of the ULX. In both cases\nwe used the interstellar abundances and absorption cross-sections\ntabulated by Wilms, Allen & McCray (2000) (the TBABS model in\nXSPEC).\nInitial fits to the data were attempted using absorbed, single-\ncomponent spectral models. However, despite trying a wide range\nof simple models (e.g. blackbody; thermal bremmstrahlung; multi-\ncolour disc blackbody; MEKAL optically-thin thermal plasma) no\ngood fit to the data was found. The best-fitting simple model was an\nabsorbed power-law continuum, as found in previous observations\nof NGC 5204 X-1 (Roberts et al. 2001, 2004, 2005), in this case\nwithNH= (1.3\u00b10.2)\u00d71021 cm\u22122 and \u0393 = 2.83\u00b10.08. However\nthis was still rejected at high significance (\u03c72\/dof of 212.3\/141,\ni.e. a rejection probability of Prej = 99.99%).3 We show the\npower-law fit and residuals in Fig. 5. As with previous observa-\ntions, the overall continuum shape of this ULX is soft. However,\nthis spectrum is remarkable in that it shows a large residual feature\nat \u223c 0.8 \u2212 1 keV, with further possible residuals evident at both\nlower and higher energies.\nAs we cannot achieve good fits using single component spec-\ntral models, we turned to two-component models. Specifically, we\ntried the empirical models discussed at length in Roberts et al.\n(2005), utilised in fitting the XMM-Newton spectrum of this source.\n2 Data below 0.5 keV were not considered in this analysis due to calibra-\ntion uncertainties in this regime. In addition, although we quote 10 keV as\nthe upper limit, in practise we have only one data bin above 6 keV.\n3 We consider spectral fits to be formally acceptable if their rejection prob-\nability is < 95%.\nFigure 5. Power-law continuum fit to the spectrum of the 50 ks observation.\nThe upper panel shows the data and best fitting power-law model (see text\nfor details), and the lower panel shows the \u2206\u03c7 residuals to this model.\nThese were the standard empirical description of a black hole X-ray\nbinary spectrum, a soft multicolour disc blackbody plus a harder\npower-law continuum, and the non-standard inversion of this spec-\ntrum where the power-law continuum dominates at soft energies.\nWe note that the XMM-Newton data showed ambiguity between\nthese two models, i.e. it did not indicate a strong preference for\none or the other. We again find that our data does not strongly dis-\ntinguish between these two models for NGC 5204 X-1, with best\nfitting parameters of inner accretion disc temperature kTin \u223c 0.18\nkeV and power-law photon index \u0393 \u223c 2.7 for the standard model\nfit, and kTin \u223c 1.2 keV, \u0393 \u223c 3.9 for the non-standard fit. How-\never, unlike the XMM-Newton observation, neither model provides\na good description of the data in this case, with both rejected at\n99.96% significance.\nInstead, statistically-acceptable fits were found using two-\ncomponent models in which the soft component was modelled by\na MEKAL thermal plasma. Good fits (rejection probability Prej <\n80%) were found using either a power-law continuum or a multi-\ncolour disc blackbody as the hard component.

As we were able to fit the hard component\nwith either a power-law or a multi-colour disc blackbody in Mod-\nels (1) & (2), we therefore attempted two continuum fits, one with\neach as the hard component. We chose to use a classic blackbody\nas the soft component. This results in two empirical models with\npossibly quite different physical origins, i.e. an accretion disc plus\nhot corona model (blackbody + power-law continuum), and an ac-\ncretion disc plus a soft excess model (in which the soft excess is\nmodelled by the blackbody). The use of both models resulted in\ngood fits to the data above 1 keV, but left large residuals at lower\nenergies as expected. In both cases we were able to fit these resid-\nuals, and hence provide an acceptable fit to the full dataset, using\na single broad gaussian line at an energy of \u223c 0.96 keV (cf. Mod-\nels (3) & (4) of Table 3). However, neither underlying continuum\nmodel appears to support the presence of a cool (\u223c 0.1\u2212 0.3 keV)\naccretion disc in this ULX, that one would expect if an IMBH were\npresent.\nThere has been some recent speculation that ULXs may form\npreferentially in low-metallicity environments, as these potentially\nallow the formation of large black holes (cf. Soria et al. 2005\nand references therein). Evidence in support of this has recently\nemerged in a deep XMM-Newton observation of the Ho II ULX\n(Goad et al. 2006), where an apparent excess of counts above 0.5\nkeV in the RGS spectrum of this ULX was best explained by re-\nducing the metallicity of the absorbing material to \u223c 0.6 of the\nsolar values. If we allow the metallicity of the second of our ab-\nsorption components to vary (by using the TBVARABS model, with\nall abundances constrained to the same value as a first approxima-\ntion) we find that a sub-solar abundance does provide a marginal\nimprovement to the fit for Model (3), though as Model (4) includes\nlittle or no extra absorption above the Galactic foreground column\nit is insensitive to this test. The actual improvement for Model (3)\nis \u2206\u03c72 = 5.1 for one extra degree of freedom, which is marginally\nsignificant (at the\u223c 2\u03c3 level) according to the F-test. The parame-\nterisation of Model (3) is essentially unchanged, apart from a sub-\nstantially higher column of 4.5+2.6\u22122.3 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122, and a limit of\n< 0.26 times solar abundance for the metallicity of the absorbing\nmedium.\nFinally, we attempted to fit a physical accretion disc plus\ncorona model to the data, as one might expect to see for an ac-\ncreting black hole. As per the work of Goad et al. (2006) on Ho\nII X-1, we used a DISKPN + COMPTT model (subject to the same\nsolar-abundance absorption components as the empirical models),\nwith the two components linked by using the temperature of the\ndisc to provide the input temperature of the seed photons for the\ncorona. This model did not provide a statistically-acceptable fit to\nthe data, with the best fit having \u03c72\/dof = 194\/138, though it did\nhave the interesting characteristic of being totally dominated by the\ncoronal component. An inspection of the residuals to this fit showed\nthat the feature at \u223c 1 keV was not adequately explained by this\nmodel; we therefore again added a Gaussian line. Similarly to the\nempirical models, this provided a statistically-acceptable fit to the\ndata, which we show as Model (5) of Table 3. In fact, it provides\nthe statistically best fit to the data, albeit by a small margin.4 We\nshow the data and Model (5) fit in Fig. 6. Even after the addition\nof the line - which shows very similar properties to the line derived\nfrom the empirical fits - the contribution of the disc component is\nnegligible (\u226a 1% of the 0.5 \u2013 8 keV flux), so we only show the\nparameterisation of the coronal component in the Table. This com-\nponent shows the same remarkable characteristics as the corona in\nHo II X-1, i.e. it is cool (kTe \u223c 1.4 keV), optically-thick (\u03c4 \u223c 7)5\n4 This is not simply due to allowing more degrees of freedom to vary in the\nComptonisation model than are present in empirical models - in fact, this fit\nhas the same number of degrees of freedom as models (3) and (4).\n5 The COMPTT model is not fully self-consistent, and may underestimate\nthe actual depth of the corona. For example, SRW06 model the Ho II X-1\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n8 T. P. Roberts et al.\nFigure 6. Model (5) fitted to the spectrum of the 50 ks observation. The\nupper panel shows the data and best fitted model, with the contribution of\nthe gaussian line and the optically-thick corona highlighted by dashed and\ndotted lines respectively (as can be seen, the corona effectively models the\nfull continuum other than in the 0.8 - 1.1 keV regime). The lower panel\nshows the \u2206\u03c7 residuals to this model.\nand seeded by photons originating in a cool (\u223c 0.1 keV) disc. In-\nterestingly, this is supportive of other recent work, most notably a\nsample of 13 bright ULXs observed with XMM-Newton (SRW06),\nthat shows that it is plausible that the X-ray spectra of a large pro-\nportion of ULXs are well described by an optically-thick coronal\ncomponent seeded by a cool disc. We note that by fixing kTe = 50\nkeV and re-fitting, one can get a statistically-acceptable solution\nwith an optically-thin corona (\u03c4 \u223c 0.2, \u03c72\/dof = 150.6\/137),\nthough this does require the disc temperature to reduce further to\n\u223c 20 eV. However, an F-test shows that the improvement offered\nover this by the optically-thick solution is significant at the \u223c 3\u03c3\nlevel. We therefore view an optically-thick solution as far more re-\nalistic.\nThe spectral modelling results in a typical observed 0.5 \u2013 8\nkeV flux of \u223c 9.8 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (with only a few per\ncent disagreement between the models in Table 3), from which we\ncan derive an average luminosity of \u223c 2.7\u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 over the\nduration of the observation.\n4.2 Spectral variability within the 50 ks observation\nAs Fig. 4 shows, the factor \u223c 2 variation in flux during the obser-\nvation is accompanied by some spectral variation. We have investi-\ngated whether we can quantify this variation through spectral fitting\nin the following manner. We first selected and extracted spectral\ndata from three 10-ks segments within the 50-ks observation, these\nbeing the 5 \u2013 15, 25 \u2013 35 and 40 \u2013 50 ks windows. Roughly speak-\ning, these correspond to relatively stable high (> 0.2 count s\u22121),\nlow (< 0.2 count s\u22121) and medium (\u223c 0.2 count s\u22121) flux states\nduring the observation (cf. Fig. 2; we refer to each segment by these\nrespective titles hereafter). The relative differences in these spectra\nare demonstrated in Fig. 7, where we plot the \u2206\u03c7 residuals for each\ntime segment spectrum against the best fitting model to the whole\nobservation (Model (5), i.e. the optically-thick coronal model).\nIn order to study these spectral differences, we loaded all three\ndatasets into XSPEC simultaneously.

The spectral variability of NGC 5204 X-1 during the 50 ks ob-\nservation. We use the three segments described in the text, and plot the \u2206\u03c7\nresiduals against the Model (5) fit, i.e. the best-fitting description of the\nspectrum of the whole observation. The three panels are shown on the same\nscale for direct comparison.\neach spectral model were identified by first freezing all the model\ncomponents, and then thawing the parameters one-by-one, untying\ntheir values across the three datasets, and re-fitting. Those param-\neters offering the largest reduction in the overall \u03c72 value for the\nsimultaneous fit were judged to be the most important in explaining\nthe spectral variation of the ULX.\nAs Fig. 7 shows, a comparison of the spectral segments to the\nmodel best-fitting the whole spectrum demonstrates the presence of\nconsiderable residuals. Indeed, when loaded into XSPEC this model\nproved a very poor simultaneous fit to the three data segments, with\na \u03c72\/dof value of 572\/200. The majority of spectral variability\nappears to originate above 1 keV, particularly in the case of the\n\u201clow\u201d segment spectrum, where considerable additional curvature\nis present. We find that this spectral variability can be very simply\nand adequately modelled by a variation in the temperature of the\ncoronal component, which provides a statistically-acceptable fit to\nthe data (\u03c72\/dof = 226.7\/197, i.e. Prej \u2248 93%). A striking fea-\nture of this fit is that it appears that the temperature of the coronal\ncomponent falls and rises in line with the flux of the ULX, that is\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\nChandra monitoring observations of NGC 5204 X-1 9\nTable 4.

A slight additional improvement to the fit is offered by\nthawing and untying the optical depth of the corona, though as it\noffers a mere \u2206\u03c72 = 6.9 improvement for three additional degrees\nof freedom it is not statistically robust. However, we still tabulate\nthe best-fitted values of \u03c4 in Table 4 (alongside the best-fitted coro-\nnal temperatures and fluxes for each segment) as we take the view\nthat changes in the optical depth are at least a plausible occurrence\nas the coronal temperature varies. Furthermore, we note that free-\ning either the temperature of the seed photons, or the normalisation\nof the coronal model, does not provide any improvement to the fit.\nFinally, in this model there is no necessity for the flux, central line\nenergy or line width of the Gaussian component at 1 keV to vary at\nall during the observation.\n4.3 Spectral variability throughout the programme\nAs Fig. 4 indicates, the spectrum of NGC 5204 X-1 seems to vary\nin a consistent manner as the count rate varies across the entire\ndataset, including the series of follow-up observations. We there-\nfore hypothesize that the observed X-ray variability during the en-\ntire monitoring campaign can be explained by the optically-thick\ncorona model (i.e. Model (5)), as proved adequate for the intra-\nobservation variability during the 50-ks observation. Unfortunately,\nthe data from the 5-ks snapshots are generally of insufficient qual-\nity to constrain the fits (particularly when the count rate is low).\nWe therefore co-added spectra to produce reasonable quality data\nto work with. Specifically, we co-added spectra from observation\nsequence numbers 600308, 600309, 600312 and 600313, to pro-\nvide a \u201cfaint\u201d state spectrum, as all these observations had aver-\nage count rates in the 0.11 \u2013 0.13 count s\u22121 regime. Similarly,\nwe combined spectra from observation sequence numbers 600310,\n600311, 600315 and 600317 (i.e. where average count rates were\nbetween 0.41 \u2013 0.47 count s\u22121), to provide a \u201cbright\u201d state spec-\ntrum. Again, we began by comparing the extracted spectra to the\nbest fitted spectrum from the deep observation (Model (5)), and\nnote that both co-added spectra showed considerable changes rela-\ntive to this spectrum. We again demonstrate this by plotting the \u2206\u03c7\nresiduals of these datasets compared to Model (5) in Figure 8.\nWe find that the faint state spectrum is very adequately\nexplained by the optically-thick corona model, with \u03c72\/dof =\n67.8\/69. The majority of the variability can be modelled as a\nchange in the coronal temperature, with additional marginally sig-\nnificant improvements (at the \u223c 95% level according to the F-test)\noffered by changes in the optical depth of the corona and, for the\nfirst time, changes in the temperature of the photons seeding the\ncorona (i.e. the accretion disc temperature). Interestingly, the 90%\nerrors on the parameters do allow an optically-thin, hot corona so-\nlution in this case, but again only if the accretion disc temperature\nreduces further to \u223c 20 eV. We note that the presence of the Gaus-\nFigure 8. The spectral variability of NGC 5204 X-1 from the follow-up\nobservations. As per Fig. 7, we plot the \u2206\u03c7 residuals against the Model (5)\nfit.

Thawing each of the coronal temperature, its optical depth and\nseed photon temperature in turn provides a significant improvement\nto the fit each time, though the resultant fit has \u03c72\/dof = 195\/146,\ni.e. it is rejected at the 99.6% confidence level. However, an inspec-\ntion of the residuals reveals that just two isolated bins (at\u223c 1.5 and\n\u223c 5.5 keV) disagree strongly with the model, providing \u2206\u03c72 \u2248 18\neach to the fit. If they are removed, the fit becomes tenable (\u03c72\/dof\n= 159\/146, i.e. Prej < 80%). We therefore conclude that, assum-\ning these two bins do not represent real spectral features6, the un-\nderlying spectral form is still adequately modelled by the optically-\nthick corona model.\nWe compare the spectral parameters from the bright and faint\nco-added spectra with the parameters from the 50-ks observation\n(derived whilst the Gaussian parameters and absorption remained\nfrozen, as is the case for the co-added spectra) in Table 5. In\n6 The deficit present in the \u223c 5.5 keV bin can be modelled by an edge\nfeature, at an energy of 5.1 \u00b1 0.2 keV, with a depth of 0.9+0.6\n\u22120.4\nkeV. This\nproduces an improvement of \u2206\u03c72 = 20.4 for two extra degrees of free-\ndom, and results in a fit that is only marginally rejected (Prej = 95.8%).\nHowever, an edge at this energy may be astrophysically implausible - the\nnearest edge is neutral Ti (\u223c 5 keV), or if it were to be an edge from neutral\nFe it would require a redshift of \u223c 0.3. No such improvement is possible\nfor the 1.5 keV bin, which is unlikely to be a real feature as its width is\nfar narrower than the ACIS-S resolution at that energy. There are no known\nACIS-S calibration issues at this energy, and an inspection of the individual\ncontributory spectra indicates that this feature originates in the juxtaposi-\ntion of less significant residual data points from two out of four spectra,\nindicating this feature may simply be an extreme statistical fluctuation.\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n10 T.

As these flux\nchanges only occur on timescales of days, it is interesting to note\nthat this may indicate that the accretion disc temperature changes\nare occuring on the same timescale. It is certainly true that in the\none instance we are sensitive to shorter timescale variations in the\naccretion disc temperature, i.e. in the 50-ks observation, we do not\nsee such an effect. We note again that the temperatures - in this\ncase of both the seed photons and the corona - appear to vary in\nline with the overall flux of the spectrum, with the system being\nhotter when it is brighter, though the optical depth appears to vary\nindependently in this comparison.\nWhilst this and the previous section have demonstrated that\nthe spectral variability of NGC 5204 X-1 can readily be explained\nthrough changes in the dominant coronal component of Model (5),\nthis was not the only spectral model capable of providing an accept-\nable fit to the full data from the 50-ks observation. By repeating the\nabove analysis for the other spectral models in Table 3 we find that\nModels (1), (3) and (4) can all also adequately describe the spectral\nvariations (we exclude Model (2) for reasons explained below in\nSection 5.2). We tabulate the variable parameters for these models\nin Table 6. In each case, the component responsible for the \u223c 1\nkeV feature - a MEKAL in Model (1), or Gaussian line in Models\n(3) & (4) - remains invariant, whilst the other parameters are re-\nquired to change to provide an acceptable fit to the data.7. In each\ncase, the fitted parameter values again reflect the pattern of spectral\nhardening with increased luminosity.\n4.4 A comparison with XMM-Newton data\nAs a final metric of the longer term spectral variations of NGC 5204\nX-1 we have re-analysed data from an XMM-Newton observation of\nNGC 5204 X-1 taken 8 months before our monitoring programme\ncommenced. This data set (Observation ID 0142270101) was taken\non 2003 January 6, and provides 15.4\/18.5 ks of live-time corrected\nexposure in the EPIC pn\/MOS instruments respectively, with data\nquality comparable to the 50-ks Chandra observation. (We note\nthat there were two further observations of NGC 5204 X-1 taken\n7 In fitting the models, we allowed the power-law normalisations for Mod-\nels (1) and (3), and the normalisation for the blackbody in Model (4), to\nvary. A variation in the normalisations for the components plausibly de-\nscribing an accretion disc - the blackbody in Model (3), and the multi-colour\ndisc blackbody in Model (4) - was not required, consistent with changes in\nthe temperature of the inner-edge of the accretion disc.\nin mid-2003, but both were subject to strong background flaring\nleaving little useful exposure for analysis.) The results of this ob-\nservation have previously been discussed by Roberts et al. (2005)\nand SRW06. Here we use the XMM-Newton science analysis soft-\nware (SAS) version 6.5.0 to re-extract the data from the original ob-\nservation data files (ODFs) available in the XMM-Newton science\narchive, in order to take advantage of refinements in the calibration\nof the EPIC instruments. We then created 0.3 \u2013 10 keV source spec-\ntra from this data, and fit them in XSPEC, in the manner described\nby Roberts et al. (2005).\nThe data were firstly fitted with Model (5) using the same\nmethodology as in the previous sections, i.e. the best fitting pa-\nrameters from the 50-ks Chandra observation were thawed one-\nby-one to assess whether variations from the parameter in ques-\ntion best explain the difference between data sets. In this case we\nwere required not just to vary the three physical parameters used\nto describe the variations in the Chandra data (T0, kTe and \u03c4 ), but\nalso the normalisations of the disc and coronal components, in or-\nder to achieve an acceptable fit. We show the best fit parameter-\nisation of the XMM-Newton spectra using Model (5) in Table 5.\nThe XMM-Newton data appears to follow the same flux - coronal\ntemperature relationship as observed for the various Chandra data.\nUnlike the Chandra data, we were able to measure an appreciable\ncontribution to the spectrum from an accretion disc component in\nthe XMM-Newton data, likely due to the slightly softer response of\nEPIC compared to ACIS. However, this was small, amounting to\nonly \u223c 2.5 per cent of the observed flux in the 0.3 \u2013 10 keV band,\nthough as SRW06 found the disc contribution in empirical disc plus\ncorona models rarely amounts to more than 10 per cent of the flux\nin this band for ULXs.\nAs in the previous section, we also fit the XMM-Newton data\nwith Models (1), (3) and (4). The results are shown in Table 6.\nAgain, we required that extra normalisations were thawed and re-\nfit in order to get statistically-acceptable fits, notably the normali-\nsations for the disc components in Models (3) and (4). The param-\neterisation of the XMM-Newton fits emphasize that this spectrum\nappears different to the subsequent Chandra observations. Overall,\nthey betray a harder spectrum, with both harder spectral parame-\nters, and a general dimunition of the flux in the softer component.\nFor example, the flux in the MEKAL component in Model (1) is\nreduced to \u223c 20 per cent of its value in the later Chandra obser-\nvations (though, where present, the flux of the Gaussian feature is\nagain not required to change in order to obtain a good fit). Hence\nit appears that in the eight months between the XMM-Newton ob-\nservation and the Chandra monitoring the spectrum of NGC 5204\nX-1 softened, in large part due to an increase in flux at low ener-\ngies. Finally, we emphasize that these models are just a sub-set of\nthose fitting this data, and refer the reader to Roberts et al. (2005)\nand SRW06 for more discussion.\n5 DISCUSSION\n5.1 On the temporal variability\nAs this programme is amongst the first dedicated X-ray monitoring\ncampaigns for any ULX, it provides us with a new view of a poorly-\nexplored region of ULX parameter space, namely X-ray variations\nover timescales of hours to weeks. During the campaign the count\nrate of NGC 5204 X-1 varied between \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.5 count s\u22121,\nwith a corresponding observed luminosity range of \u223c 1.3\u2212 6.3 \u00d7\n1039 erg s\u22121.

Indeed, using the B0 Ib\nidentification of the counterpart to NGC 5204 X-1 found by Liu et\nal. (2004), and assuming that the star (which has M\u2217 = 25 M\u2299,\nR\u2217 = 30 R\u2299) fills its Roche lobe, Liu et al. predict orbital periods\nof 200-300 hours for black holes in the mass range 3-1000 M\u2299\nunderlying NGC 5204 X-1, providing us with a testable hypothesis.\nThe most likely and dramatic manifestation of this periodicity\nwould be in the form of eclipses of the X-ray source by the super-\ngiant secondary star, as is discussed for ULXs in general by Pooley\n& Rappaport (2005). These authors point out that the presence of\neclipses in ULX light curves could be an additional diagnostic of\nthe mass of the black hole in the ULX, with stellar-mass black hole\nsystems at least twice as likely to display eclipses. Promisingly, the\nfairly large amplitude (factor \u223c 5) variability seen in NGC 5204\nX-1 on timescales of days occurs between fairly consistent \u201chigh\u201d\n(\u223c 0.5 count s\u22121) and \u201clow\u201d (\u223c 0.1 count s\u22121) flux states, that\none might perhaps expect to see as the source goes in and out of\neclipse. However, no periodic signal to support this interpretation\nwas recovered from the data. This argues that the variability is not\ndue to eclipsing, but may simply be due to accretion processes pro-\nducing variability on the timescale of days. If this is true of many\nULXs, then detecting X-ray eclipses on the timescale of their or-\nbits (which Pooley & Rappaport note could vary from 1-150 days,\neven for a very limited choice of black hole\/secondary star mass\nassumptions) may be far more difficult than simply getting round\nthe logistical problem of acquiring X-ray monitoring data with a\nhigh observational efficiency over timescales of days.8\nDespite the lack of a periodic signal, short-timescale (i.e.\nintra-observation) variability could still be a useful diagnostic of the\naccretion state of the ULX through standard analysis techniques,\nfor example the calculation of the fluctuation Power Spectral Den-\nsity for the ULX. However, such analyses are in practice ham-\npered by the poor photon statistics of our data - we have too few\nphotons for reliable PSD analyses of the short observations, and\ncan do no better than a few 10s of seconds resolution in our light\ncurves before becoming dominated by Poisson noise. Despite this\nthe light curve data we do have, and the PSD of the 50 ks obser-\nvation, are good enough to tell us that NGC 5204 X-1 displays no\nstrong variability on timescales less than a few thousand seconds.\nOn timescales longer than this NGC 5204 X-1 is varying, sugges-\ntive of a red noise PSD with its weak power at higher (\n\u223c\n> 10\u22123 Hz)\nfrequencies swamped by statistical noise in the data.\n8 Though we note that true extragalactic eclipsing sources may now be\nstarting to be observed, for example with the detection of a slightly sub-\nULX luminosity source in NGC 4214 with an eclipse periodicity of 3.6-hr\n(Ghosh et al. 2006b).\n5.1.1 A comparison with GRS 1915+105\nOne interesting means of interpreting our temporal data is via a di-\nrect comparison with GRS 1915+105 (see Fender & Belloni 2004\nfor a review of the properties of this remarkable object). This source\nis the archetypal Galactic microquasar, and has spent much of its\n(to date) 15-yr outburst radiating at luminosities at or above the\nEddington limit for its \u223c 14M\u2299 black hole (Done, Wardzin\u00b4ski &\nGierlin\u00b4ski 2004). This would make it a ULX to an observer ex-\nternal to our Galaxy, hence it is potentially crucial for our under-\nstanding of ULXs as a whole. As it has a low-mass companion,\nKing (2002) suggested that sources akin to GRS 1915+105 could\nexplain the lower-luminosity ULXs associated with old stellar pop-\nulations (such as the population of 1\u2212 2\u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 ULXs as-\nsociated with elliptical galaxies; Irwin, Bregman & Athey 2004). A\ndirect comparison between GRS 1915+105 and the brighter ULXs\n- thought to have much more massive companion stars - may there-\nfore seem illogical. However there may be some crucial similar-\nities, for example both types of system are thought to transfer\nmass through Roche lobe overflow, and possibly accrete at super-\nEddington rates. Hence GRS 1915+105 may still be useful in in-\nterpreting the behaviour of brighter ULXs. For instance Goad et\nal. (2006) find that Ho II X-1, which is far more luminous than\nGRS 1915+105 (at > 1040 erg s\u22121) and a good IMBH candidate\n(Dewangen et al. 2005), shows no temporal variability over short\n(< 1 hour) timescales during an \u223c 80 ks observation. Interest-\ningly, its light curve and PSD during this observation appear to\nmirror the \u03c7-class of behaviours of GRS1915+105 (Belloni et al.\n2000). Taken together with a possible mass limit derived from PSD\nanalysis, Goad et al. argue that Ho II X-1 is a < 100M\u2299 black hole\naccreting at very high rates, and thus behaving similarly to GRS\n1915+105 in its \u201c\u03c7\u201d (or \u201cplateau\u201d) state.\nOne simple test is to qualitatively compare the long-term\nlight curve of GRS 1915+105 obtained from RXTE all-sky mon-\nitor (ASM) data (Fig. 2, Fender & Belloni 2004) to our monitor-\ning light curve. Despite a moderate bandpass difference (0.5 \u2013 8\nkeV for Chandra ACIS-S versus 1.5 \u2013 12 keV for the ASM), both\nlight curves show a similar amplitude variability, factors\u223c 5 over a\ntimescale of days. Indeed, it is plausible that if one randomly sam-\npled the GRS 1915+105 light curve at the same rate as our NGC\n5204 X-1 light curve in Fig. 1, one would find a very similar light\ncurve. However, this similarity is not necessarily maintained over\nshorter timescales. In particular GRS 1915+105 spends a reason-\nable fraction of its time (\u223c 33 \u2212 50%)9 displaying fairly extreme\n9 We calculate this from Table 1 of Belloni et al. (2000). We assume that\nthe 349 observation intervals between January 1996 and December 1997\nare representative of the behaviour of GRS 1915+105, and that the \u03c7 and \u03c6\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n12 T. P. Roberts et al.\nshort-term variability, characterised by complex, sometimes very\nrepetitive variability patterns in its light curves with cycle times\nranging from tens to thousands of seconds. These are thought to be\ndue to limit-cycle instabilities in the inner accretion disc such that\nit is continually emptying and refilling (Belloni et al. 2000)10 . No\nsuch behaviour is seen from NGC 5204 X-1, even though we are\nsensitive to variations on timescales\n\u223c\n< 100 seconds in our data.\nWhat does this imply about the nature of NGC 5204 X-1?\nAn important clue could be that GRS 1915+105 only displays\nits unique limit-cycle variability when it is accreting at super-\nEddington rates (Done et al. 2004). This implies that this behaviour\ncould be an observational signature of super-Eddington accretion.\nIf so, the absence of such behaviour in NGC 5204 X-1 would im-\nply it is accreting at a sub-Eddington rate. In this case, we must ei-\nther be observing beamed X-ray emission (likely of the variety sug-\ngested by King et al. 2001) or observing isotropic emission from a\nlarger black hole, with the peak luminosities of 6.3\u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121\nimplying a black hole mass in excess of 45M\u2299. Interestingly, as\nmost ULXs also show little or no short-term variability (cf. Swartz\net al. 2004, Feng & Kaaret 2005), and certainly nothing resembling\nthe limit-cycle variability of GRS 1915+105, this argument could\nimply that the vast majority of ULXs are sub-Eddington accretors.\nOf course, this is reliant on the limit-cycle behaviour of GRS\n1915+105 being typical of all sources accreting above the Edding-\nton rate, and this is by no means assured. For example, there are\nseveral neutron stars that exceed the Eddington limit in our own\nGalaxy (including Cir X-1 at up to 10 LEdd), none of which show\nlimit-cycle variability similar to GRS 1915+105, though Done et al.\n(2004) note that irradiation of the accretion flow by the boundary\nlayer on the neutron star\u2019s surface might act as a stabilizing mech-\nanism. Perhaps more pertinently, other Galactic black holes have\nreached super-Eddington states (McClintock & Remillard 2005),\nwith no reports of similar limit-cycle variability. If we are to use\nthe apparent absence of limit-cycle variability as an argument that\nULXs are sub-Eddington accretors, then the key observation would\nbe to catch a ULX behaving in precisely this way when it radiates\nat its brightest X-ray luminosities. Otherwise, the lack of such be-\nhaviour in ULXs might just serve to emphasize how unusual GRS\n1915+105 actually is.\n5.2 On the soft part of the X-ray spectrum\nAs Fig. 5 demonstrates, the soft end of our X-ray spectrum showed\nunusual residuals, most notably a line-like feature peaking at \u223c 1\nkeV. Our spectral modelling showed that this feature could be de-\nscribed in two ways; either it is the most prominent feature deriv-\ning from the presence of a warm (kT \u223c 0.9 keV) MEKAL optically\nthin thermal plasma, or it could be described by a single, broadened\n(\u03c3 \u223c 70 eV) Gaussian line at 0.96 keV, with a relatively low equiv-\nalent width (\u223c 50 \u2212 80 eV). Whilst the other components of the\nspectral modelling were required to vary to maintain good spectral\nfits throughout our campaign, the contribution of this component\nremained the same.\nstates (that are present in \u223c 50% of observations) will appear invariant in\nour observations. We note that the \u03b1, \u03b3 and \u03b4 states (a further \u223c 17%) may\nalso appear as such in our comparatively low quality data.\n10 In this case the limit-cycle instability is thought to be driven by cyclical\nchanges in the balance between gas pressure and radiation pressure. This\nis distinct from a second form of limit-cycle instability, namely the ionised\nversus neutral hydrogen cycle, which dominates the long-term transient be-\nhaviour (i.e. outburst versus quiescense) in accretion discs.\nSo what is the origin of this feature? ULXs in which a MEKAL\ncomponent models some part of their X-ray spectrum are relatively\nscarce (though see e.g. Terashima & Wilson 2004; Roberts et al.\n2004; Dewangen et al. 2005; Feng & Kaaret 2005; Soria et al.\n2006), and in some of these cases we are faced with a very soft\ncomponent that is spectrally indistinguishable from a very soft ac-\ncretion disc with the quality of data available. That is not the case\nin this observation, where an optically-thin plasma clearly provides\nthe best explanation for the soft X-ray spectrum. This fit is driven\nby the feature at\u223c 1 keV, similarly to the MEKAL component found\nto be required to fit the spectrum of NGC 4395 X-1 (SRW06; Feng\n& Kaaret 2005).\nFeng & Kaaret (2005) argue that a soft thermal component\ncould arise in a supernova remnant (SNR) co-located with the ULX.\nFor this to be true, the contribution of the SNR to the X-ray flux of\nthe ULX must always be less than (or at most equal to) the total ob-\nserved flux, as a structure of light years in size cannot vary its X-ray\nflux on the timescale of hours to days. By examining the contribu-\ntion of the MEKAL components in Models (1) & (2) to the fitted\nspectrum of the 50-ks observation, we can infer that the MEKAL\nfrom Model (1) contributes \u223c 0.03 count s\u22121 to the overall count\nrate, which is plausible given the minimum observed count rates of\n\u223c 0.1 count s\u22121 for NGC 5204 X-1. However, in Model (2) the\nMEKAL is responsible for \u223c 0.16 count s\u22121, meaning it cannot\noriginate in a large structure like a SNR.11 If the thermal compo-\nnent in Model (1) does originate in a SNR, we note that it can-\nnot be very old - its temperature of \u223c 0.96 keV is rather similar\nto the temperatures of the reverse shock components that become\nvisible on the timescale of years \u2013 a couple of decades in recent\nsupernovae (e.g. Immler & Lewin 2003) but somewhat higher than\nthe \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.4 keV temperatures of the fainter and older SNR\npopulation of M33 (Ghavamian et al. 2006). The fact that the X-\nray flux of this component is seen to brighten by a factor \u223c 5 in\nthe eight months between the XMM-Newton observation and the\nChandra programme (during which it remains constant) may be\ndifficult to reconcile with a large structure such as an SNR, though\nwe note that the X-ray emission of SN 1987A has been seen to\nevolve relatively rapidly (on the timescale of months) as its blast\nwave propagates outwards and hits dense clumps of ISM, causing\nX-ray \u201chotspots\u201d to turn on (e.g. Park et al. 2004). However, in this\ncase it is puzzling that one does not detect any bright radio emission\nfrom NGC 5204 X-1 (Ko\u00a8rding, Colbert & Falcke 2005), as most\nX-ray bright recent supernovae also appear radio bright (Immler &\nLewin 2003).\nIf the feature does not arise in an underlying SNR, where else\ncould it originate? If we consider the Gaussian line fit, its line width\nof \u223c 60-80 eV corresponds to velocities of 0.06-0.08c (18000-\n24000 km s\u22121) for matter radiating a single emission line. Whilst\nthese velocities may be plausible for the innermost regions of an\naccretion disc and\/or a mildly relativistic outflow, in the absence\nof direct evidence for a relativistic origin (for example, a classic\nskewed line profile, or a measurement of its blue- or redshift), or\nindeed a good candidate for a single dominant emission line at this\nenergy, perhaps a more realistic interpretation is that the feature\noriginates as a blend of the Ne K and Fe L lines prominent around\n0.96 keV.\n11 As the necessity to vary this MEKAL component conflicts with every\nother model showing that the soft component remains invariant as the ULX\nflux changes, we do not consider this model as viable for explaining the\nspectral changes, and so exclude it from the analysis in Section 4.3.\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\nChandra monitoring observations of NGC 5204 X-1 13\nIt is once again pertinent to raise GRS1915+105 at this point,\nas recent XMM-Newton EPIC observations have shown that it dis-\nplays a remarkably similar spectral feature, namely a broad (\u03c3 \u223c\n90 eV) emission line at 0.97 keV, albeit with a much higher equiv-\nalent width of 5.6 keV (Martocchia et al. 2006). Whilst there are\ncaveats attached to this detection - most notably the non-detection\nof a corresponding feature in simultaneous XMM-Newton RGS data\n- this finding again raises the question of whether there are at least\nsome physical similarities between GRS1915+105 and NGC 5204\nX-1. Martocchia et al. (2006) interpret the line feature as possible\nevidence for a photoionized disc wind (a collisionally-ionized wind\nis also discussed, but rejected because calculations show any such\nwind in GRS 1915+105 must be approaching the optically-thick\nregime). The same interpretation could apply to NGC 5204 X-1,\nthough the lower equivalent width of its line requires an explana-\ntion (speculations could include the continuum level being higher\nrelative to the wind emission, or the wind emission simply being\nless bright in NGC 5204 X-1 than GRS 1915+105). If so, this could\nbe the first evidence of a photoionized disc wind contributing to the\nX-ray emission of a ULX.\n5.3 On the overall spectral shape and its variation\nIn Table 3 we show five spectral models, four of which are broadly\nempirical and the fifth more physically-based, which can ade-\nquately describe the 50-ks Chandra ACIS-S spectrum of NGC\n5204 X-1. We can arguably rule one fit (number 2) out. We are then\nleft with models that (if taken at face value) variously describe (1)\na compact non-thermal emitter surrounded by a near-solar metal-\nlicity thermal plasma, (3) a fairly \u201cstandard\u201d representation of an\naccretion disc plus corona spectrum with a broad emission line just\nshort of 1 keV, (4) a standard accretion disc plus soft thermal ex-\ncess model with the same emission line and (5) a physical accre-\ntion disc plus corona model, again with the broad emission line.\nUnfortunately even with the relatively good quality of a \u223c 9000\ncount ACIS-S spectrum we can only tell that these are all adequate\ndescriptions of the spectral shape, and not begin to distinguish be-\ntween these models in a statistical sense. We are then left to make\nthe choice as to whether we draw our physical insight from the\nsimpler, empirical models by comparison to the fits these models\nmake to better understood sources, or whether we trust the insight\nof more physical models at the possible cost of allowing more de-\ngrees of freedom and\/or potential ambiguity if the best-fitting pa-\nrameters show large uncertainty ranges. Both methods have ben-\nefits and drawbacks (with opposite viewpoints outlined by Miller,\nFabian & Miller 2006 and Goncalves & Soria 2006). Here, we will\nconsider the insights provided by the physical model further.\nSRW06 find that the majority of ULXs with high-quality\nXMM-Newton EPIC spectral data display a spectral break (which\ncould also be described as a cut-off, or interpreted as an indicator\nof curvature) above 2 keV, which could be an important clue as to\nthe physical nature of ULXs. These authors are not the only ones\nto identify such a feature in ULXs; this was firstly seen by Kub-\nota, Done & Makishima (2002) in ASCA GIS data from IC 342\nX-1, and more recently has been seen for other ULXs observed by\nXMM-Newton, notably the top IMBH candidates Ho IX X-1 (De-\nwangen, Griffiths & Rao 2006) and M82 X-1 (Agrawal & Misra\n2006). This break argues against the simple IMBH model where\nthe emission above 2 keV is dominated by a single power-law con-\ntinuum representative of an optically-thin hot corona (as observed\nin most Galactic black hole X-ray binaries), and could indicate the\npresence of unusual physical processes in the system. One such ex-\nplanation discussed by SRW06 is the presence of an optically-thick\ncorona. Though such fits require the seeding of the corona by a\ndisc with an IMBH-like temperature, SRW06 refer to two models\n(Zhang et al. 2000; Done & Kubota 2006) viably describing very\nhigh accretion rate systems - with no requirement for an IMBH -\nthat could explain both the apparently cool disc emission, and the\noptically thick corona (see also Kuncic & Bicknell 2004 for a sim-\nilar model).\nOur physical model (5) describes the continuum emission of\nNGC 5204 X-1 as an optically thick corona seeded by a cool\ndisc, consistent with the modelling of other ULXs from XMM-\nNewton data.12 Importantly, the Chandra data is of sufficient qual-\nity to demonstrate that this solution is preferred at the 3\u03c3 level to\nan optically-thin solution (with the latter also taking an implausi-\nbly low disc temperature of 20 eV). Perversely though, the Chan-\ndra data alone is not of good enough quality to rule out an unbroken\npower-law above 2 keV, with the simple power-law versus broken\npower-law test of SRW06 inconclusive in this instance. This is per-\nhaps unsurprising given that there are only three data points above\n5 keV in the Chandra data, and that models including a hard power-\nlaw [(1), (3)] do provide good fits to the data. In this case we can\nturn to the XMM-Newton data for this ULX for confirmation, which\nas SRW06 demonstrate does indeed show a significant break fea-\nture at \u223c 5 keV.\nHowever, if we are to maintain any faith in this physical\nmodel, its parameters must vary in a physical way throughout the\nmonitoring programme. Our modelling of data taken from within\nthe 50-ks observation, and from the full monitoring programme,\nshow that the hardening of the spectra with increasing flux (graph-\nically demonstrated by the hardness ratios of Fig. 4) can be mod-\nelled predominantly as an increase in the temperature of the corona\nas the ULX luminosity increases, with additional changes in the\nseed disc temperature occuring over timescales of days. This trend\nis not just seen in the Chandra data; as we have shown, an XMM-\nNewton observation is also consistent with this behaviour. Interest-\ningly, this echoes the behaviour of XTE J1550-564 in a subset of\nits very high state that Kubota & Done (2004) describe as a \u201cstrong\nvery high state\u201d. This state is characterised by strong Comptonisa-\ntion from a cool (albeit in this case still 10 - 30 keV) corona, and un-\nusually low disc temperatures for its luminosity (\u223c 0.5 keV against\nan expectation of\u223c 1 keV for that luminosity in the high\/soft state).\nIn this state the temperature of the corona does indeed seem to track\nthe luminosity of the system (see Fig. 5 of Kubota & Done 2004).\nWe therefore speculate that NGC 5204 X-1 is in a more extreme\nversion of this strong very high state, characterised by a cooler\ndisc and a thicker corona. We further speculate that this thicker\ncorona could be fueled by the extreme mass transfer rates possi-\nble for ULXs if they are stellar-mass black holes accreting from\nyoung, massive stars as described by Rappaport, Podsiadlowski &\nPhahl (2005). Indeed, Done & Kubota (2006) note that this state\nhas the characteristics to explain the X-ray spectra of many ULXs\nwithout the need to resort to IMBHs.\nWe therefore conclude that the optically-thick solution re-\nmains a physically plausible model for this ULX, though we cau-\ntion that it is by no means an unique solution for this data. As re-\nported in previous work, this could again mean that we are look-\ning at a very high accretion rate stellar-mass (or slightly larger)\n12 Obviously we have a second, line-like component in our spectral fit.\nFor the purposes of this discussion we treat its origin as separate from the\nunderlying continuum.\nc\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n14 T. P. Roberts et al.\nblack hole. In this state it could share some similarities with GRS\n1915+105, though we have shown that limit-cycle variability does\nnot appear to be one of them. A possible outflow identified by the\nsoft, broad emission line-like component identified at \u223c 0.96 keV\nis however one potential similarity. Whilst the possible detection\nof an optically thick corona continues a current trend for bright\nULXs (and should not be a surprise given SRW06 detected a sim-\nilar spectrum in XMM-Newton data for this ULX), the detection\nof the broad line feature is unexpected. The presence of this line is\ncertainly very unusual when compared to the range of ULX charac-\nteristics reported to date, and as such it should be fully investigated\nby future studies, in particular by utilising the reflection grating\nspectrometers on XMM-Newton to probe the composition of this\nfeature.\n6 CONCLUSION\nWe have reported the results of a two-month monitoring pro-\ngramme of NGC 5204 X-1, over timescales of days to weeks. We\ndetect no periodic variability, and the source shows little variability\nat all on timescales less than an hour, though it varies by factors of\n\u223c 5 over a few days. This flux variation is accompanied by spectral\nchanges, in the sense that the source spectrum becomes harder as\nthe flux increases. The spectrum of the ULX is composed of two\nmain features: a broad emission line at \u223c 0.96 keV, and a smooth\nunderlying continuum, that can together be described by a vari-\nety of multi-component models. One of these models describes a\ncontinuum originating in an optically-thick corona, consistent with\nother recent results for ULXs, that could describe an extreme form\nof a strongly Comptonised very high state that is seen in Galactic\nblack hole X-ray binaries. The spectral variations appear consistent\nwith the known behaviour of sources in this state. This model does\nnot require an IMBH to power the ULX. Of course, this is not the\nsame as ruling out the presence of an IMBH in this system.\nThe insights gained from studying variations in the X-ray\nspectra and temporal characteristics of Galactic black holes over\ntimescales from milliseconds to years have been immense, and\nhave been facilitated by the unique capabilities of the RXTE satel-\nlite (McClintock & Remillard 2006 and references therein). Such\nstudies cannot currently be done for any single extragalactic ULX,\nwith the exception of M82 X-1 (Kaaret, Simet & Lang 2006a,b),\nand even that study is limited by effects such as the possible con-\nfusion of multiple ULXs in the centre of M82. For the remaining\nfainter sources we are currently constrained to small monitoring\ncampaigns using XMM-Newton and Chandra, which have been sur-\nprisingly rare to date given the potential physical insights they can\noffer. Future, sensitive all-sky monitors with arcminute resolution\nsuch as Lobster (Fraser et al. 2002) will at least offer a reasonable\nmonitoring platform for the brightest ULXs so that we can finally\nexamine the details of their day-to-day behaviour. Until then, im-\nprovement in our insights into the physical processes of ULXs -\nand hence their underlying nature - will continue to rely on ob-\ntaining deeper single observations, or more monitoring of the type\ndescribed in this paper.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank an anonymous referee for helping us to\nimprove this paper. TPR gratefully acknowledges support from the\nUK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC).\nThe authors would also like to thank Simon Vaughan for his advice\non temporal analyses, and Chris Done for discussions on Galactic\nblack holes. This work is in part based on observations obtained\nwith XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and\ncontributions directly funded by ESA member states and the USA\n(NASA).\nREFERENCES\nAbramowicz M.A., Kluz\u00b4niak W., McClintock J.E., Remillard R.A., 2004,\nApJ, 609, L63\nAgrawal V.K., Misra R., 2006, ApJ, 638, L83\nBauer F.E., Brandt W.N., Sambruna R.M., Chartas G., Garmire G., Kaspi\nS., Netzer H., 2001, AJ, 122, 182\nBauer M., Pietsch W., 2005, A&A, 442, 925\nBegelman M.C., 2002, ApJ, 568, L97\nBelloni T., Klein-Wolt M., Me\u00b4ndez M., van der Klis M., van Paradijs J.,\n2000, A&A, 355, 271\nCiliegi P., Elvis M., Wilkes B.J., Boyle B.J., McMahon R.G., 1997, MN-\nRAS, 284, 401\nColbert E.J.M., Mushotzky R.F., 1999, ApJ, 519, 89\nColbert E.J.M., Ptak A.F., 2002, ApJS, 143, 25\nCropper M., Soria R., Mushotzky R.F., Wu K., Markwardt C.B., Pakull M.,\n2004, MNRAS, 349, 39\nDavid L.P., Jones C., Forman W., Murray S.S., 2005, ApJ, 635, 1053\nDewangan G.C., Griffiths R.E., Choudhury M., Miyaji T., Schurch N.J.,\n2005, ApJ, 635, 198\nDewangan G.C., Griffiths R.E., Rao A.R., 2006, ApJ, 641, L125\nDewangan G.C., Miyaji T., Griffiths R.E., Lehmann I., 2004, ApJ, 608, L57\nDewangan G.C., Titarchuk L., Griffiths R.E., 2006, ApJ, 637, L21\nDone C., Kubota A., 2006, MNRAS, in press (astro-ph\/0511030)\nDone C., Wardzin\u00b4ski G., Gierlin\u00b4ski M., 2004, MNRAS, 349, 393\nEbisawa K., Zycki P., Kubota A., Mizuno T., Wataria K., 2003, ApJ, 597,\n780\nFabbiano G., 1989, ARA&A, 87, 27\nFabbiano G., Zezas A., King A.R., Ponman T.J., Rots A., Schweizer F.,\n2003, ApJ, 584, L5\nFender R., Belloni T., 2004, ARA&A, 42, 317\nFeng H., Kaaret P., 2005, ApJ, 633, 1052\nFiorito R., Titarchuk L., 2004, ApJ, 614, L113\nFoschini L., Rodriguez J., Fuchs Y., Ho L.C., Dadina M., Di Cocco G.,\nCourvoisier T.J.-L., Malaguti G., 2004, A&A, 416, 529\nFraser G., et al., 2002, Proc.
