The\nearliest systematic study of electropolishing led to a patent in\n1930.1 The majority of research in this area has been carried\nout on stainless steel although metals such as copper, nickel\nand titanium have also been studied.2\u20134 The present stainless\nsteel electropolishing process is performed worldwide on a\ncommercial scale and is based on mixtures of concentrated\nphosphoric and sulfuric acids. The polishing process is\nthought to involve the formation of a viscous layer at the\nmetal surface and as a result many processes employ viscosity\nimprovers such as glycerol. The practical aspects of electro-\npolishing have been reviewed recently5 following on from a\ndescription of the more fundamental aspects.6 While electro-\npolishing is an extremely successful process there are major\nlimitations and practical issues associated with the technology;\nmost notably that the solution used is highly corrosive and\ntoxic, extensive gas evolution (with associated low current\nefficiency) also occurs during the process.\nDuring the last twenty years ionic liquids have found\napplication in a wide variety of electrochemical and synthetic\nprocesses.7\u201310 Most of the academic studies on ionic liquids\nhave concentrated on imidazolium and pyridinium cations,\nhowever their high cost and sensitivity to water has made them\nof little practical use for large-scale applications such as metal\nfinishing. Eutectic mixtures of zinc, tin and iron halides, in\ncombination with one of a variety of quaternary ammonium\nsalts, can be easily formulated and used for metal finish-\ning.11\u201314 These ionic liquids are air and moisture stable, the\ncomponents are widely available, relatively benign and in-\nexpensive allowing their usage in large-scale applications such\nas metal deposition. For example zinc and zinc alloys can be\nelectrodeposited with high current efficiency from these ionic\nliquids.13,14 This technology has been extended to other metals\nby using hydrated metal salts.15,16 For example, mixtures of\nCrCl3 \u0001 6H2O with choline chloride form a liquid that can be\nused for the efficient electrodeposition of chromium.\nThe principle behind the formation of an ionic liquid by\ncomplexation of the halide anion has been extended by mixing\nquaternary ammonium salts with compounds that form hy-\ndrogen bonds. This has been demonstrated with a range of\nhydrogen bond donors including amides such as urea17 and\ncarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid.18 We have previously\nshown19 that ethylene glycol can also be used as the hydrogen\nbond donor, and that mixtures of ethylene glycol with choline\nchloride can be used for the electropolishing of stainless\nsteel.20 This process has three main advantages over the\ncommercial alternative: (i) high current efficiencies are ob-\ntained; (ii) gas evolution at the anode\/solution interface during\npolishing is negligible; and (iii) the liquid used is comparatively\nbenign and non-corrosive compared to the current aqueous\nacid solutions. In a previous study we have presented a.c.\nimpedance, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chrono-\namperometric data in an attempt to investigate the mechanism\nof electropolishing in these glycol mixtures.20 An interpreta-\ntion of the data from that study, focussed specifically on 316\ngrade stainless steel, suggested that the formation and dissolu-\ntion of a metal oxide passivation layer at the metal\u2013liquid\ninterface is a key feature of the metal dissolution mechanism\na Chemistry Department, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK LE1\n7RH.

It is clear that the differences\nin bulk composition for different grades of steel will influence\nthe nature and stability of this oxide film, however, we have\nsought to develop an alternative electropolishing process that\ncan encompass a range of different alloys. Consequently in the\ncurrent investigation we studied the electropolishing process\non a variety of stainless steel grades (SS410, 302, 304, 316 and\n347). Also we report our findings on the variation of surface\nand sub-surface composition together with morphological\nchanges that accompany the electropolishing process. We have\nused a combination of electrochemical techniques e.g. LSV,\nand surface probes including scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photo-\nelectron spectroscopy (XPS).\nExperimental\nCholine chloride (ChCl) (Aldrich 99%) was recrystallised from\nabsolute ethanol, filtered and dried under vacuum. Ethylene\nglycol (EG) (Aldrich 99+%) was used as received. The\nmixture was formed by stirring the two components (1 ChCl\n: 2 EG) at 75 1C until a homogeneous colourless liquid was\nformed. Voltammetry was carried out using an Autolab\nPGSTAT12 potentiostat controlled using GPES software. A\nthree-electrode system consisting of a stainless steel (SS410,\n302, 304, 316 or 347) disc working electrode (0.5 mm radius),\nsealed in glass, a platinum counter electrode and a silver wire\nreference electrode were used. The working electrode was\nabraded with 150 grit glass paper, rinsed and dried prior to\nall measurements to ensure reproducible voltammetric beha-\nviour. Electrochemical measurements were performed at 20 1C\nand a scan rate of 20 mV s\u00031 was used in voltammetric\nexperiments except where stated.\nSurface analysis was carried out using scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) (Philips XL30 ESEM). Samples of the\ndifferent grades of steel were examined using EDX prior to\ntreatment in order to confirm compositional compliance with\nthe AISI grading defined in Table 1. XPS data were acquired\nusing the Scienta ESCA300 instrument at the NCESS facility,\nDaresbury laboratory. Samples were subjected to Ar ion\netching by filling the sample preparation chamber of the\nScienta instrument with Ar gas to a pressure of approximately\n2 \u0004 10\u00036 Torr. The sample was then exposed to the Ar ion\nbeam for a time period of typically between 1\u20132 min using an\naccelerator voltage of 5 kV resulting in a beam current of\n200 mA. The AFM images were obtained using a Digital\nInstruments Nanoscope IV Dimension 300 (Veeco) with a\n100 mm scanning head and run using both contact and tapping\n(resonant) modes. Images were acquired both in air and also in\nthe liquid environment. The latter procedure was performed\nusing the Veeco liquid attachment with the corresponding\nprobes.\nResults and discussion\nStainless steels are alloys composed mostly of Fe in combina-\ntion with Ni and Cr often with small quantities of other metals\nsuch as Mn, Mo, Nb,and Ta together with trace amounts of C,\nSi, P and S. Compositional ranges for the standard grades\n(AISI) of stainless steels studied here are summarised in Table\n1. The detailed chemistries of the different standard grades are\nwell known, with the minor components playing important\nroles in the metallurgical properties of the steels. For example\nthe extent to which C is present as a solid solution in Fe is\nquite different for 400 series steels (martensitic, low Ni) than\nthat for 300 (austenitic) series materials. This has a strong\ninfluence on the hardness and tempering of the steel. Addition\nof other metals such as Mo, Nb and Ta have stabilising effects,\nfor example Nb and Ta are added to ss347, Table 1, in\nstoichiometric excess, with respect to C, in order to prevent\nformation of Cr carbides. All of these subtleties determine the\nbulk phase structure of the steel and contribute to the surface\nproperties such as corrosion resistance. The Cr content, in\nparticular, is critical to the corrosion resistance of the steel\nsince it encourages the formation of a mixed oxide film on the\nsurface. Our previous study on the in situ electrochemical a.c.\nimpedance during electropolishing of 316 grade stainless steel\nin an ethylene glycol (EG)\/choline chloride (ChCl) mixtures\nhas suggested that the properties of this metal oxide film at the\nsurface, rather than the bulk phase structure of the steel, has\nthe most significant influence on the quality of the optical\nfinish obtained.19,20 Consequently, this study has primarily\nfocussed not on the individual roles of the minor components\nof the bulk phases in the different steels but on the character-\nisation of the surface oxide layer and its dissolution mechan-\nism using surface spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques\ne.g. LSV.\nXPS analysis of oxide passivation layer\nIn order to establish the presence of the oxide layer on the\nstainless steel surface and to estimate the rate of formation of\nthis layer in an aerobic environment XPS was used as a surface\nspecific technique.

The same sample\nwas then returned to the XPS instrument for analysis and\ncomparison. Fig. 1c and d show the XPS spectra of the Fe(2p)\nand Cr(2p) regions, respectively, for the sample exposed to air.\nEach of these clearly shows two features; the original metallic\nlines as well as a pair of broader lines shifted to higher binding\nenergy. The binding energy and shape of these features are\nconsistent with the formation of surface Fe and Cr oxides.\nSpectral deconvolution (iterative curve fitting) of both the\n2p(1\/2) and 2p(3\/2) components of the Cr and Fe regions,\nusing the two component environments shown in Fig. 1d,\nreveals that approximately 70% (\u000510) of the surface Fe is in\nan oxidised form, while 65% (\u00055) of the Cr is present as a\nsurface oxide. Fig. 1e shows the O(1s) region of the same\nsample before and after exposure to air. Little detectable O is\npresent on the cleaned surface whereas the O(1s) signal for the\nexposed sample is very strong. It is noteworthy, however, that\nsome of the observed O(1s) intensity is probably due to\nadsorbed O containing organics. This is evidenced by a small\namount of C also visible (in the C(1s) region) on the surface of\nthe exposed sample.\nThe surface penetration depth of the XPS experiment is\nlimited to a few nanometres because of inelastic collisions and\nrecapture events. However, the sub surface volume over which\nthe photoelectron response is integrated is a function of the\nangle that the electron energy analyser makes with the sample\nsurface (take off angle, TOA). The volume of integration is\nmaximised at a TOA of 901 whereas at smaller values of TOA\nthe technique becomes much more surface specific. In the\nexperiments above the TOA was set to 901. The experiment\nwas then repeated at a TOA of 101; this effectively probes only\nthe outer most 1\u20132 nm of the surface. Fig. 1f shows the Fe(2p)\nof the exposed sample with a TOA of 101. Here only the Fe\noxide layer is visible with no sign of the underlying metallic\niron.\nElectrochemistry of stainless steels in EG\/ChCl. The results\nof a series of LSV experiments carried out with various grades\nof stainless steels in 2EG : 1ChCl mixture are summarised in\nFig. 2. In these experiments the steel wire was formed into the\nworking electrode of a 3 electrode cell. This was achieved by\nencasing the wire in a glass tube using epoxy resin; the wire\nsurface was exposed by polishing. A fresh surface was ob-\ntained by manual abrasion using glass paper (see Experimental\nsection). Direct comparison, and interconversion, of potential\ndata from EG\/ChCl liquids is difficult because of liquid\njunction effects associated with aqueous (or other solvent)\nreference electrodes. Consequently a silver wire pseudo refer-\nence electrode was used. Whilst the reference potential of the\nsilver wire is, in principle, prone to fluctuation we have\nobserved that the potential is dominated by the chloride ion\nconcentration which is both very high (4.18 mol dm\u00033) and\nessentially invariant throughout our experiments.\nFive freshly abraded steel electrodes, having individual\ncompositions summarised in Table 1 were prepared and stored\novernight in deionised water. The steel electrodes were then\ndried and transferred into a fresh mixture of EG and ChCl (in\na molar ratio 2EG : 1ChCl). Fig. 2a shows the LSV response\nfor each of the different steels. All the sample steels show a\nsingle anodic peak at a potential in excess of 1.5 V. The\nvariation in peak current is quite large; this is due to\na variation in surface area (electrodes with 0.5 mm and\nFig. 1 X-ray photoelectron spectra recorded on a polished piece of stainless steel 304 etched for 2 min with an Ar ion beam in the analysis\nchamber of the spectrometer; before; (a) Fe(2p) region, (b) Cr(2p) region and after (c) Fe(2p) region, (d) Cr(2p) exposure to air for 10 min.

The most\nanodic onset potential is exhibited by the SS410 sample and\nthe least anodic by the SS316. The SS316 alloy has the highest\nNi content of these samples where as the SS410 alloy has the\nlowest (with no Ni).\nThe electrodes were again abraded and stored in deionised\nwater as before. Subsequently they were dried, transferred to a\ncell containing the ionic liquid and abraded again in situ in an\nattempt to physically remove the oxide film and to minimise\nthe rate of reoxidation. Fig. 2b shows the LSV responses of the\nsteel electrodes prepared this way without an oxide film. These\nresponses are once again dominated by a single anodic dis-\nsolution peak, however, all the dissolution peaks are shifted\ncathodically by 1100\u20131800 mV. Interestingly, under these\nconditions, the SS410 sample has the most cathodic dissolu-\ntion onset potential whilst the SS316 has the most anodic one.\nConsequentially it follows that for any given steel composi-\ntion, at an electrode potential in the region lying between the\ntwo onset potentials (defined by the LSV curves, Fig. 2a and b\ni.e. in the presence and absence, respectively, of the oxide film),\nmetal dissolution is thermodynamically favourable yet\nstrongly inhibited by the presence of the surface oxide layer.\nFor example at a potential of +0.75 V, Fig. 2b, where little or\nno oxide film is present, the magnitude of anodic current is in\nexcess of 100 mA for all samples whereas at the equivalent\npotential, Fig. 2a where oxide film is established, the current\nvalues are close to zero.\nThe significance of this is that in 400 series the oxide is\nthermodynamically the most difficult to remove but the under-\nlying metal is significantly easier to dissolve than any of the\n300 series steels. This is important because in practical situa-\ntions the electropolishing of 400 series steels at low current\ndensities will lead to incomplete oxide removal which will\ncause pitting dissolution where the underlying alloy is exposed.\nThis is indeed the case, even in aqueous solutions. One\npractical remedy is to use an acid pickle to chemically remove\nthe oxide film.\nIn a separate experiment the removal of oxide film from the\nsteel samples by chemical dissolution in a commercial \u2018\u2018pick-\nling\u2019\u2019 solution was explored. The \u2018\u2018pickling\u2019\u2019 solution consisted\nof a proprietary mix of phosphoric acid and a surfactant.23 The\nsteel electrode surfaces were prepared in the same way as those\nfor which the data are shown in Fig. 2a, however, in place of\ndeionised water, the electrodes were soaked in pickling solution\nbefore being rinsed and transferred to the EG\/ChCl liquid.\nThese data are presented in Fig. 2c. Here the linear sweep\nvoltammograms for most of the steels are very similar to those\nshown in Fig. 2a. Consequently it is clear that the chemical\npickle does not remove the oxide layer from most of the steel\nsurfaces. However, the response for the 410 grade sample bears\na much stronger resemblance to that in Fig. 2b, indicating that\nfor this steel the pickle is effective at oxide film removal.\nSEM and EDX analysis\nWe set out to compare the surface morphology and composi-\ntion of polished and unpolished regions of the steels. This was\naccomplished by preparing steel samples with regions masked\noff using an acrylic resin insoluble in the ionic liquid. The\nsamples were then subjected to the electropolishing regime and\nthe mask was subsequently removed with acetone. This metho-\ndology facilitates both qualitative and quantitative compar-\nison of composition and morphology over a spatially confined\nregion of the same surface. Fig. 3a shows an optical photo-\ngraph of one such sample (stainless steel 304) after the removal\nof the resin mask: here the polished (p) and unpolished (u)\nregions are clearly visible. This sample was transferred into the\nSEM and the image presented as Fig. 3b shows the unpolished\n(masked) surface. The magnitude and type of grain boundary\npattern are characteristic of stainless steel sheet. In the image\npresented as Fig. 3c both polished and unpolished regions are\nclearly visible, separated by a boundary defined by the mask.\nThe polished region appears very much smoother with no\ntrace of the grain boundary pattern seen in the unpolished\nregion. Since one of the motivations for the commercial\nelectropolishing process is to improve corrosion resistance of\nthe substrate it was important for us to establish that the\npolishing mechanism in the ionic liquid did not result in gross\nchanges of the elemental composition at the interface i.e.\ndealloying. Data obtained from energy dispersive X-ray ana-\nlysis (EDX), using a beam spot on each side of the boundary\nobserved in the image shown in Fig. 3c, are presented in Table\n2. These show clearly that the composition of the alloy (insofar\nas we have analysed for the main components only) is\nunchanged by the polishing process and therefore that no\ndealloying occurs.\nFig. 2 Linear sweep voltammograms recorded for various grade steel wires (0.5 mm diam. except SS347 1.0 mm diam.) in ethylene glycol choline\nchloride ionic liquid.

This, in turn, is a\nfunction of the experimental beam energy (accelerator vol-\ntage). In our experiments the spallation depth of the electron\nbeam was between 1 and 3 mm. Consequently the EDX data\ngive no information about alloy composition at the solid liquid\ninterface. In order to probe the manifestation and magnitude\nof any surface dealloying, samples of stainless steels (patterned\nin the way described above) were examined using an XPS\nimaging technique. Fig. 4 shows XPS images acquired in the\nCr(2p) and Fe(2p) binding energy regions for the sample\nwhose optical and SEM images are presented in Fig. 3. This\ntechnique records a 1-D image of the sample along the\ndirection perpendicular to the direction of the patterned\nstripes. The Y-axis of the image corresponds to binding\nenergy, the X-axis defines position on the sample and the\ncolour intensity scale corresponds to electron counts.24,25 Both\nof the XPS images, shown as Fig. 4a and b, exhibit prominent\nvertical line features. These occur at the same lateral position\non both images and correspond to the delineation of the\npolished and unpolished regions. The lateral feature (blue in\ncolour) that runs across the image presented in Fig. 4a\ncorresponds to the Fe(2p3\/2) spectral line whilst that in Fig.\n4b corresponds to the Cr (2p3\/2) spectral line. There is some\nvariation in the intensity of both the Fe(2p) and the Cr(2p)\nsignals across the sample. This might suggest some variation in\nsurface composition between the two regions. However there\nis no obvious discontinuity in the colour across the bound-\naries. In fact, the observed variation in signal intensity can be\naccounted for by the variation in detector sensitivity. This is\nillustrated by Fig. 4c which shows an XPS image (on the Fe\n(2p 3\/2) line) of a homogeneous region of polished steel from\nthe same sample. The same variation of signal intensity is\nobserved here in the absence of surface morphology or com-\npositional contrast. From this qualitative analysis of these\ndata we conclude that there is no evidence of surface deal-\nloying resulting from electropolishing. This is consistent with\nour solution analyses previously presented.19,20\nSurface morphology\nIn order to study the surface morphology and roughness of the\nsteels before and after polishing and in an attempt to quantify\nTable 2\nSample area\nSample composition (EDX spot analysis)\n%Fe %Cr %Ni\nPolished 68.9 17.6 10.1\nUnpolished 68.8 17.3 10.2\nFig. 3 (a) Photograph of a sample of stainless steel 304 masked (with acrylic resin) and polished with ca. 1 mm stripes showing unpolished (u) and\npolished (p) regions.

Fig. 5 shows height contrast images of\na sample of stainless steel 304 recorded across the boundary\nbetween polished and unpolished areas over a length scale of\nca. 74 \u0004 72 mm. The height contrast projection, Fig. 5a, shows\nclearly defined areas of morphology contrast in much the same\nway as the corresponding SEM image, Fig. 3c. The surface\nreconstruction using the height data from Fig. 5a, is shown in\nFig. 5b. A cross-section of this surface, corresponding to a\nsingle line scan at X = 35.6 mm, is shown in Fig. 5c. The\nunpolished area of the surface shows the same surface rough-\nness and grain boundary structure as that observed in the\nSEM. Although the surface is very rough (giving rise to its\noptically dull finish), with feature sizes of up to 500 nm, it is\nalso very flat; see Fig. 5c in the region y o 30 mm. This is no\ndoubt a consequence of the production technique (rolling). In\ncontrast, the polished region, Fig. 5c in the region y4 40 mm,\nhas a bright optical finish, it is very smooth but there are large\nscale fluctuations in height. Surface roughness can be ex-\npressed as a peak-trough height, Zmax, measured over a\ndesignated area of the image. Quantification of the images\ndescribed above was carried out using a square sample area\n(25 mm2) at random positions across the polished and unpol-\nished regions. Mean values of Zmax (calculated over 10 mea-\nsurements) for the unpolished and polished surface were\ndetermined as 497 (\u000550) nm and 88 (\u000510) nm, respectively.\nThe value of Zmax for the unpolished surface is larger than it\nmight be anticipated but this is almost certainly due to surface\ninclination (i.e. the surface is not flat) rather than intrinsic\nroughness. An alternative measure of surface roughness can be\ncalculated from the difference ratio of geometric sample area,\nAG, (here this is 25 mm\n2) to the real surface area, AR, calculated\nfrom the height data. Surface roughness, R, is then expressed\nas a percentage according to eqn (1).\nR \u00bc AR \u0003 AG\nAG\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u0004 100% \u00f01\u00de\nBy this method the unpolished region of the sample has an\naverage roughness of 7.94% whereas the polished region has a\nvalue of just 0.15%. At the edge of the boundary between\npolished and unpolished areas the extent of metal etch is\nvisible. Up to 2 mm of metal is lost at the boundary; this falls\nto 1 mm at distances further away from the mask edge. There is\nno evidence of undercutting at the mask suggesting that the\netch is isotropic.\nLiquid AFM in situ studies\nIn an attempt to understand better the electrodissolution\nprocess we have studied the surface transformation of the\nsteel during polishing using in situ liquid AFM. This was\naccomplished with a liquid interface attachment for the\nAFM instrument together with the corresponding probes.\nAlthough the liquid interface attachment was designed for\nuse in an aqueous environment we have found that it also\nfunctions well in the ionic liquid. The attachment was operated\nin tapping (resonant) mode and despite the relatively high\nviscosity of the liquid (50 mPa s @ 293 K) a tip resonance was\neasily located at between 6\u20138 kHz without the necessity for an\nexcessively high drive amplitude. A schematic representation\nof the electrochemical cell used for the in situ AFM experiment\nis shown in Fig. 6. The cell was constructed using a SS316\nanode plate for the base and a copper foil cathode. The copper\nfoil was insulated from the anode with adhesive PVC tape and\na rubber O-ring was fixed over both electrodes (using silicone\nrubber adhesive) as containment for the liquid electrolyte. To\nminimise the influence of the geometry of the probe assembly\non the current density near the surface the steel plate was\nimaged through a 5 mm hole in the Cu cathode. Real time\nimaging of the process is experimentally very difficult because\nsmall fragments and particles of metal are discharged from the\nsurface during the dissolution process. These diffuse through\nthe liquid passing between the laser source, the tip assembly\nand the photodetector. The resultant scattering of the laser\nlight results in perturbation (noise) and ultimately loss of\nfeedback control. As a result the images were recorded at\ndiscrete intervals before polishing, part way through and at the\nend of the polishing process. These images are shown in Fig. 7.\nIn order to ensure that the same representative area was\nimaged each time the tip was not fully withdrawn from the\nsurface (enabling reasonably accurate repositioning) between\nmeasurements.\nThe image of the unpolished steel surface is shown in Fig.\n7a. Here the morphology and magnitude of surface roughness\nare consistent with those observed previously. The diagonal\nscore marks at the bottom left hand corner of this image are\nFig. 5 Resonant mode (ca. 300 kHz) AFM images (recorded in air at a scan rate of 0.5 Hz, 256 lines) of the sample, Fig. 3, at the interface between\npolished and unpolished regions, (a) tip-height contrast projection and (b) 3-D surface map showing the corresponding height scale, (c) slice\nthrough the surface at X = 35.6 mm showing the tip height data for a single line scan.\nThis journal is \u0002c the Owner Societies 2006 Phys.

The resolution\nof the grain boundary features is good suggesting that there\nare no tip control problems or imaging artefacts associated\nwith surface wetting. The steel was then subjected to the\npolishing conditions for 10 min (constant current density @\n25 mA cm\u00032). The tip was taken off the surface and the surface\ndebris was removed by circulation of the polishing liquid\nwithout moving the probe. The scanning tip was then re-\nengaged and the image presented in Fig. 7c was recorded. This\nprocedure was repeated, the final image after polishing for\n25 min is presented in Fig. 7e. Alongside each of these images\nis presented height data for a single line scan across the middle\nof the sample, Fig. 7b, d and f. To facilitate comparison the\nheight scales are identical for each plot although there is no\ncorrelation between the absolute values.26 These data show\nclearly the qualitative transition from the unpolished to po-\nlished surfaces. The intermediate finish is evident in Fig. 7c\nshowing what remains of the surface features of the unpol-\nished surface. The surface has been eroded first at the most\nprominent features where the electric field and presumably,\ncurrent density, are at their greatest. The single line scan data\nshow that although the polished surface is very smooth there\nare large scale variations in height. These are comparable in\nsize to the unpolished surface but over a much smaller length\nscale in the latter. Quantitative analysis of the images using the\ntwo methods described in the previous section are presented in\nTable 3. The surface roughness (area difference ratio) shows a\nmarked and progressive downward trend whilst the value of\nZmax is largely unchanged. It is noteworthy that the values of\nZmax presented in the table do not correspond to the line scans\nin Fig. 7 because they are measured over the whole image.\nConclusions\nHere we have studied the anodic dissolution process of a\nnumber of stainless steel alloys by electrochemical methods\nand a variety of surface analysis techniques. We conclude from\nXPS measurements that surface oxide formation at the clean\nsteel surface is rapid under aerobic conditions and from LSV\ndata we have observed that breakdown of this oxide coating is\nFig. 6 Schematic diagram of the liquid cell for in situ AFM measure-\nments.

Anodic\ndissolution of metal ions from steel surfaces where the oxide\nlayer was removed in situ was seen to be much faster than at\nthe equivalent alloy surface where oxide coating was encour-\naged and allowed to remain. Aggressive proprietary chemical\ntreatments of the steels were successful in removing the oxide\nfrom only one of the samples studied here (SS410). A combi-\nnation of XPS imaging and EDX analysis was used to probe\nthe elemental composition of both the outermost surface of the\nsteels as well as the sub-surface volume. Analysis of these data\nshows that there is no evidence of dealloying of the steels\nduring polishing in this ionic liquid.\nProbe microscopy studies in combination with SEM have\ngiven both a qualitative and a quantitative insight into the\npolishing mechanism. Initial etching occurs at the most pro-\nminent of the surface features and proceeds until these features\nhave been completely removed. Interestingly the unpolished\nsurface was much flatter, although rougher, than the resultant\npolished finish. Conversely the polished surface was seen to be\nvery smooth but with similar height variations over a larger\ndistance scale. The size of the crevices and valleys observed in\nthe unpolished surface in relation to the wavelength range of\nvisible light gives rise to its dull finish, whereas the relative\nsmoothness of the polished surface over the 1\u20132 mm scale\nresults in an optically bright finish. Consequently the larger\nscale undulations are not detrimental to the subjective quality\nof the polished surface. With the use of masking techniques we\nhave been able to estimate the extent of etch. During a 5 min\netching process 1 mm of metal was removed.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the DTI (ETREAT) and the\nEU (Framework 6 project IONMET, http:\/\/www.ionmet.org\/)\nfor funding.
