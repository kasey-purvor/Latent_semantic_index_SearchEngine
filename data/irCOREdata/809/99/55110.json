Over an 8-week pre-season period, HT \ngroup continued with their normal training programme, whilst the PT group added \ntwo additional 1-hr plyometric-specific sessions, incorporating prescribed exercises \nrelating to the swimming block start (SBS). Following completion of the training \nintervention, post-training swim start performance was re-assessed. For both baseline \nand post-trials, swim performance was recorded using videography (50Hz Canon \nMVX460) in the sagital plane of motion. Through the use of Silicon Coach Pro \nanalysis package findings revealed significantly greater change between baseline and \npost-trials for PT when compared to HT group for swim performance time to 5.5 m (-\n0.59s vs. -0.21s; P <0.01) and velocity of take-off to contact (0.19 ms-1 vs. -0.07 ms-1; \nP <0.01). Considering the practical importance of a successful swim start to overall \nperformance outcome, the current study has found that inclusion of suitable and safely \nimplemented plyometric training to adolescent performers, in addition to habitual \ntraining routines, can have a positive impact on swim start performance.  \n \nKey Words: power production, overload, swim time  \n \n \n \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  4\nINTRODUCTION \nReferring to physical movements characterised by forceful contractions in response to \nmyostatic-stretching of active muscles (8), the use of plyometrics as a means of \nencouraging the muscle to achieve maximal force rapidly and therefore serving to \nincrease explosive-reactive power through a range of motion is a popular training \napproach (8). By developing the efficiency of the neuromuscular system in achieving \nmaximum explosive-reactive power, the application of plyometric training (PT) as a \nmeans to developing the performer has lead to wide use within sports that require fast \nexplosive movements (2). \n \nEstablished as a valuable strategy for enhancing force generating potential of \nexplosive-reactive movements, the effectiveness of such training approach depends on \nthe incorporation of sport-specific movements, applied through appropriate frequency \nand intensity over extended periods. With explosive sports requiring rapid maximal \nmuscular force production, such appropriate manipulation of the stretch-shortening \ncycle to increase efficiency has had a consequential positive effect on sports \nperformance (3). By developing the muscular-reflex to withstand high-stretch loads, \ncombined with the decreased neural disinhibition of muscle proprioceptors, PT \nproduces neuromuscular adaptation and specific muscular activation for coordinated \nmovement patterns, thereby enhancing contraction force (12).  \n \nInvestigating the impact of PT on dynamic movement activity, Lathrop et al. (7) have \nreported substantial improvements in running economy (4.7%) and 3200m cross-\ncountry running times (3.9%) in adolescent performers, whilst Matavulj et al. (10) \nrecorded enhancements in vertical jump economy and height of junior basketball \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  5\nplayers. With significant improvements also being found following PT in 40m skating \nspeed in junior ice hockey players (8), the appliance of sport-specific plyometric \ntraining as a means of improving muscular functioning has a practical importance to \nsports performance. Despite however the growing body of evidence elucidating to the \nvalue of PT in a range of sporting activities, the value to such approach to swimming \nhas had little investigation. Although once in the water, performance benefits of PT \nmay be negligible, when considered that the swimming block start (SBS), which \nrequires explosive-reactive muscular response, accounts for up to 30 percent of total \n50m race time (9), any improvements within this aspect of swim performance could \nhave a significant impact on overall race success. Furthermore, with winning margins \nbeing as small as 0.01 of a second in sprint swimming events (11), an appropriate \nintervention strategy to enhance explosive power output and increase performance \nefficiency during the SBS may have a meaningful impact on overall swim time.  \n \nThe age at which one is physically able to participate in a plyometric training \nprogramme has not been determined, however guidelines have been prescribed to \nassist in developing appropriate programmes for adolescents. To reduce the risk of \ninjury and facilitate the performance of plyometric exercises, programmes must \ninitially focus upon technique using low impact exercises before progressing onto \nhigher impact activities. It is recommended that athletes must have a sound \nunderstanding of plyometric and landing techniques and possess a sufficient base of \nstrength, speed and balance. Other factors such as landing surface, training area, \nequipment, proper footwear and supervision must also be assessed, as with any \nplyometric training programmes (1). Such ramifications to the implementation of \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  6\nplyometric training within developing performers must be paramount to those wishing \nto promote the effectiveness of such training approach. \n \nConsidering therefore the important contribution swim block start plays to overall \nswim performance and appreciating the explosive-reactive nature of such movement, \nthe aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a swimming-specific PT \nprogramme on start performance. By selecting adolescent competitive swimmers, the \nstudy hopes to provide the practitioner with appropriate guidelines when \nimplementing plyometric drills to develop adolescent swimmers performance \ncapabilities. \n \nMETHODS \nApproach to the Problem \nThe research hypotheses were examined by way of an experimental design \ncomprising of two independent groups (IV). Following the completion of a baseline \ntrial, which measured a range of SBS performance dependent variables, subjects were \nassigned through random selection, to one of the groups. After which the groups \nfollowed either their normal habitual training programme or a plyometric programme \nfor an eight-week period. Following the intervention period, both groups were re-\nassessed by completing the SBS performance trial. \n \nSubjects \nRecruiting subjects from local swimming clubs, criteria for inclusion was applied to \nensure all swimmers were aged 10 to 16 years and engaged in a minimum 8 hours \naquatic training per week. All were considered highly competent in executing the SBS \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  7\nby the lead investigator and coach and all had achieved a minimum of regional \nstandard within the past 18 months. Prior to the commencement of any engagement \nwith the subjects, ethics consent was granted through the University ethics committee \nand adhered to throughout the investigation.  Subjects were informed of any potential \nrisks to participation and all provided written informed consent, including consent \nfrom a parent\/guardian, in accordance with institutional regulations. The investigation \nexperienced no withdrawals and subject baseline measures and characteristics are \ndisplayed in Table 1. \n \n[Insert Table 1 here] \n \n \nProcedures \nPrior to initiating the baseline swimming block start (SBS) trial, subjects were \nrequired to conduct a standardised fifteen-minute aquatic warm-up prescribed by club \ncoaches, representing time allocated to swimmers prior to competition. Making a \nrecorded note of performed practices, subjects were then asked to get themselves \nready to perform under race conditions. In accordance with Amateur Swimming \nAssociation competitive start procedures, subjects mounted the blocks, adopted their \npreferred starting position and were counted down. Throughout each SBS trial, \nsubject\u2019s performance was filmed using a Canon MVX460 camcorder at 50Hz in the \nsagital plane of motion. The camera was positioned parallel to the motion 10-metres \nfrom the subject along the poolside and 2 metres from the starting blocks. \n \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  8\nFollowing completion of the baseline SBS trial, subjects were randomly assigned to \neither the plyometric training (PT) group or habitual training (HT) group. Over a \nperiod of eight weeks, all subjects followed the same normal habitual aquatic training \npatterns, however the PT group were provided with an additional 2 hours per week of \nspecific plyometric exercises. Exercises implemented into PT programme are \ndisplayed in Table 2. Included within are the details pertaining to the number of sets, \nreps, recovery periods and box\/hurdle heights.  Subjects were required to conduct a 10 \nminute standardised dynamic warm-up prior to each PT session to increase the \nsubject\u2019s mobility and ensure exercises could be performed safely in accordance with \nRadcliffe and Farentinos (14) who advocate that dynamic preparatory activities \n\u2018excite the neuromuscular system without undue fatigue\u2019. The exercises implemented \nwithin the PT programme were selected based upon their specificity to the SBS. \nParticular consideration was placed on ensuring boxes and hurdles were consistent \nwith recommended heights for adolescents to ensure sufficient muscular overload \ncould be achieved safely. (See Table 2 for details of the training programme).  \nNormative values with reference to box and barrier heights ensured that training \nadhered to the requirements of safety and welfare of the subjects while ensuring that \nsufficient overload was achieved (refer to Table 3 for details). \n \n[Insert Table 2 here] \n \nBeachle and Earle (1) have reported that overload can be established with appropriate \nlevels of training frequency, intensity, volume and recovery in a 6 to 8 week period. \nFurthermore, considering the subject group used in this study, the PT programme was \ndeveloped over an 8 week period to ensure gradual and safe progression within the \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  9\nadolescent performers. Chu (4) further noted that explosive-reactive power is \nestablished by implementing numerous sets of less than 6 repetitions at more than 90 \npercent of one repetition maximum with reference to the adult population. With \nRadcliffe and Farentinos (14) commenting that the intensity of PT programme should \nreflect that of competitive performance, but in considering the population-specific \ngroup in this study, variables affecting the intensity such as box heights and \nrepetitions were adjusted to ensure they were appropriate to the group. \n \nFrom the PT group, subjects were subjectively assessed by a qualified strength and \nconditioning specialist to determine the subject\u2019s levels of competency and \nadaptability to the PT programme. If deemed necessary, intensity and volume were \nsubsequently increased to ensure appropriate muscular overload. Intensity was \nincreased by altering exercise variables including: numbers of repetitions and sets \nand\/or elevated heights of boxes and hurdles. Table 3 provides a guide to the pre-\ndetermined training programme with any increases in overload remaining appropriate \nto subject\u2019s requirements and training recommendations as set by Baechle and Earle \n(1), Chu (4) and Radcliffe and Farentinos (14) to ensure safety. \n \n[Insert Table 3 here] \n \nFor the habitual training group, monitoring occurred throughout the eight week \nperiod, however, no manipulation of training intensity and\/or volume was made. \nFollowing the completion of the eight week training programme, all subjects returned \nto the pool to undertake a second SBS trial. Adhering to their baseline trial strategy, \neach subject undertook their 15 minute aquatic warm-up after which completed the \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  10\ntrial under race conditions. Matching the camera position with the baseline trial, \nperformance was once again videoed, allowing for comparitive analysis.     \n \nThrough the use of Silicon Coach Pro (siliconCOACH Ltd, New Zealand) each \nsubject\u2019s footage was uploaded and subsequently analysed to determine the time from \nthe starting stimulus to contact of the head with the water surface, the distance from \nthe starting stimulus to contact of the head with the water surface, the velocity of take-\noff to contact of the water surface, that angles relating to release off the blocks and \nangle entering the water. The dependant variables of time, distance, velocity and \nangles were identified as the key determinants of the SBS technique (11). The time to \ncomplete a distance of 5.5 metres from the starting stimulus, defined with visual \nreference points on the lane markers and poolside. The rationale behind inclusion of \nperformance time to 5.5 metres was that with the PT measuring the development of \nexplosive-reactive power, any increase in distance would be reliant upon variables \nsuch as kick strength rather than assessing SBS force production (5). \n \nStatistical Analyses \nTo determine whether the PT programme had a significant impact on measures \nmonitored during the SBS trial when compared to habitual training, data was \nsubjected to a two-tailed independent T-test on the change between baseline-post \nimplementation of the training intervention. To evaluate within group differences for \nperformance measures, a two-tailed dependent T-test was administered. Prior to the \ncompletion of the inferential analysis, a Kolmogorov-smirnov test for normality and \nMauchley test for homogeneity of variance were conducted.  Further correlational \nanalysis in the form of Pearson product moment coefficients, were performed to \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  11\nestablish relationships between SBS parameters and 5.5 metre performance time. For \nall statistical analyses alpha was set at the 95% probability level (P <0.05). Standard \nerror of the estimates (SEE) were calculated from linear regression analyses to express \nthe precision of estimate in absolute terms. \n \nRESULTS \nComparison of swim block start (SBS) performance measures revealed significant \ndifferences between the plyometric (PT) and habitual (HT) training groups (Table 4). \nBetween group baseline-post trial scores for swim performance time to 5.5 m, \nfindings revealed a significantly greater change for the PT group when compared to \nthe HT group (P < 0.01). Similarly, significantly greater change occurred across \nbaseline-post trials for the PT group was compared with the HT group for velocity of \nthe take-off to contact (P <0.01), distance to head contact (P <0.01) and time to head \ncontact (P = 0.023). Interestingly, no significance was found for the angle out of \nblocks (P = 0.12) and angle of entry into water (P = 0.27) between the PT and HT \ntraining groups. \n \n[Insert Table 4 Here] \n \nAnalysis of the within group differences between baseline-post trial measures \nrevealed (Table 4) that swim time of 5.5 m was statistically lower (P <0.001) for the \nPT group, however no significance was found for the HT group (P = 0.11). Further \nexamination also identified time to head contact from the PT group to be significantly \nlower following plyometric training intervention (P <0.01) whilst no statistical \ndifference was found for the HT group (P = 0.42). Within training groups, significant \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  12\ndifferences for angle out of blocks, distance to head contact and SBS velocity were \nalso found following their respective 8-week training programme (Table 4). \n \nThe association between SBS velocity and swim performance time to 5.5 m for both \ngroups across baseline and post trials was determined to identify the extent of  \ncorrelational change following 8-weeks of specified training (Figure 1 & 2). For the \nPT baseline trial, analysis revealed a significant relationship between the measures (r \n= -0.66, P <0.05), which was strengthened following the intervention period (r = -\n0.91, P <0.01) detailed in figure 1. Accounting for 83% of the total variance \nexplained, standard errors of estimates (SEE) for the two associations reduced by \n50%, from 0.14s to 0.07s. For the HT group, a significant association was found \nbetween SBS velocity and performance time to 5.5 m for the baseline measures (r = -\n0.69, P <0.05) however remained relatively unchanged for the post trial (r = -0.58, P \n<0.05) detailed in figure 2. Examining the SEE for both associations revealed a \nmarginal increase in error for the post (0.32s) when compared to the baseline \nassessment (0.35s). \n \n[Insert Figure 1 & 2 Here] \n \nDistance to head contact and swim time to 5.5 m was also significantly correlated for \nthe baseline assessment for both the PT (r = 0.82, P <0.01) and HT group (r = 0.66, P \n<0.05). The post-trial association between distance to head contact and time to 5.5m \nin the PT group was strengthened slightly (r = 0.88, P <0.01) following training, \nhowever for the HT group, reduction in the degree of association found (r = 0.31, P \n>0.05). Interestingly, an insignificant association was revealed for time to head \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  13\ncontact and time to 5.5 m for the baseline assessment in the PT group (r = 0.019, P \n>0.05) and the HT group (r = 0.10, p >0.05). Evaluating the post-trial associations \nhowever revealed a marginal change for PT group (r = 0.13, P >0.05) and HT group (r \n= 0.40, P > 0.05), respectively.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a swimming-specific \nPT programme on SBS performance in adolescent competitors. The major finding \nidentified that by engaging in explosive-power training sessions, additional to habitual \naquatic regimes, swim time to 5.5 metres significantly improved on average by 0.59 \nseconds, equating to a 15% improvement in performance time. With the habitual \ntraining group not exhibiting any significant change in time to 5.5 metres, it can be \nassumed that exposure to 2 hours supplementary training per week had a meaningful \nimpact on the swimmers ability to cover the distance quicker.  \n \nWith enhancements of flight dynamics following swim block release thought to \nsignificantly impact on the quality of SBS performance (16), the present study \nconfirms that as a consequence of plyometric training, significant reductions in time \nto head contact and greater distance to head contact more than likely contributed to \nthe improvements in performance time. Indicating that performers were able to \ngenerate greater release speed and power off the block, translating into faster times to \n5.5 metres, signifies to the practitioner that supplementary plyometric training offers a \nvaluable means of developing this important aspect of overall swim performance \nsuccess (9).  \n \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  14\nBy investigating the association between SBS velocity and performance time to 5.5 \nmetres before and after the intervention in both training groups revealed further \nimportant practical implications to the coach. Examination of the findings indicated \nthat as a consequence of plyometric training, the velocity from release to water \ncontact resulted in a stronger relationship (r = -0.91) with performance time than prior \nto the intervention (r = -0.66). Such improvement in the association between an \nimportant SBS variable and the key performance indicator, coupled with a meaningful \nreduction in the standard error of the estimate, signifies the important contribution \nSBS velocity must play in the achievement of reducing swim time over the first 5.5 \nmetres. For the coach working with the swimmer, exercises that focus on developing \nthe velocity of release will have a significant impact on overall swim start \nperformance. Ensuring the performer is able to maximise the power off the block by \naccelerating quickly, increases in distance and time to head contact will allow for \nfaster transit through the water once entered. Establishing whether significant \nimprovements in SBS exist following intervention requires practitioners to provide \nquantitative interpretations into the \u2018flight phase\u2019 prior to contact with the water (15). \nConsidering the complexity of such approach, research studies investigating SBS \nvariables and their impact on key performance indicators are needed. This being the \ncase the present study is the first to provide conclusive evidence that swim \nperformance time enhancement is attributable to both increased flight distance and \ntime. \n \nWith significant changes reported for angle out of the block, distance to head contact, \ntime to head contact and consequently SBS velocity, it would appear that the \nimplementation of the plyometric training intervention provided an adaptive response \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  15\nthat allowed for greater power production off the blocks. Although documented \nevidence does highlight the importance of sport-specific plyometric training to the \nenhancement of muscular force-generating capacity and neuromuscular development \n(3, 7, 8, 10, 12), limited evidence, linking plyometric training and swimming-specific \nblock starts has been reported. One such study to do so however, did conclude that \nfollowing a training intervention programme, no significant improvements in SBS \nwere found (6). Examination of approach does reveal however that implementation of \nthe plyometric training intervention did not take into consideration adaptation and \nprogression through the 6-week schedule. For the current study, increases in intensity \nand volume reflected levels of competency and adaptability to the PT programme \nover the 8 week period. Continually assessing the swimmer and adjusting their \ntraining stimulus accordingly ensured that all swimmers engaged in activities suited to \nthe adaptive responsiveness to the programme and provided a more realistic approach \nto the management and implementation of tailored training regimes. \n \nWith swimmers continuing to engage in their normal habitual training patterns, the \nstudy provided further insight into SBS performance from non-plyometric specific \ntraining. Findings indicated that despite the habitual group significantly increasing \ntheir take-off angle out of the blocks across trials, swimmers showed a decrease in \nboth distance to head contact and SBS velocity, with a concomitant increase in time to \nhead contact. With the habitual training group not performing any land-based \nplyometric training exercises it can be concluded that although aspects of SBS \nperformance altered, an inability to produce sufficient power to transfer the increased \ntake-off angle into meaningful improvements resulted in insignificant changes in \nswim performance time. \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  16\n \nSport-specific PT effectively stimulates muscle spindles, involving agonist muscle \npreloading and elastic energy storage. Through the manipulation of intensity and \nvolume, the force-generating capacity of the stretch-shortening cycle to initiate \nforceful muscular contractions can be altered (1). Allowing for more purposeful and \ndeliberate exercise tasks, Brandon (2) highlights therefore the important responsibility \npractitioners and coaches have in implementing appropriate training frequency and \nintensity to enhance such force-velocity relationship of skeletal muscle. The \noptimisation of eccentric force production significantly develops elastic muscular \ncomponents and explosive power production through enhanced motor unit firing rates \nand development of contraction intensity involved in neurophysical potentiation (13). \nInfluencing muscular power output and force production, the safe implementation of \nplyometric training in addition to habitual aquatic-based drills in the current study \nsuccessfully demonstrates the ability to explosively manoeuvre from the block start \nposition to cover greater distances in significantly faster times.  \n \nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS \nConsidering the importance of the SBS to overall race performance, the development \nof effectively managed plyometric training programmes for adolescent swimmers can \nhave a meaningful impact on overall race success. When devising such PT \nprogrammes, it is imperative that the athletes are provided with adequate supervision \nand assessment to avoid injury due to poor technique and excessive overload to the \nmuscles. The initial development of the programme should therefore be low to \nmoderate in intensity and focus upon the technical proficiency of the exercises utilised \nto avoid injury. The exercises should be specific to the movements in which increased \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  17\npower production is sought and should provide a progressive overload through \nincreases in both intensity and volume. Progression to higher overload intensities can \nbe manipulated through altering exercises and increasing the number of repetitions \nand sets and\/or elevated heights of boxes and hurdles. \n \n \n \n \n  \nPlyometrics and Swim Start Performance  18\nREFERENCES \n \n1.
