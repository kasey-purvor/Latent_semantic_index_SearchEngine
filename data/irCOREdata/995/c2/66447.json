However, some higher-density packaging \nsolutions require fine features to be patterned onto grossly \nnon-planar substrates, for example, in mechanical, optical and \nfluidic microsystems and in novel packaging schemes. \nStandard photolithography cannot be used in these cases \nbecause the inevitable gap between the (planar) mask and \n(non-planar) substrate causes diffractive line broadening and \nloss of resolution. We address this issue by realising the mask \nas a Computer Generated Hologram (CGH), which can then \nbe illuminated to generate an image in space corresponding to \nthe required non-planar profile. The CGHs are derived from \nanalytical expressions and encode both amplitude and phase \ninformation. We illustrate the performance with a 100\u00b5m line \nexposed onto a substrate in the form of a plane\/slope\/plane, in \nwhich the change in depth is 40mm. Enhancements to the line \nshape are discussed that make the technique more robust to \nmanufacturing process variations. The fact that features in the \nrange 10-100\u00b5m can be imaged at large distance whilst \ncoping with significant changes of depth indicates that the \ntechnique shows great potential in the microelectronics \npackaging industry. \nIntroduction \nPhotolithography is the primary technique for pattern \ntransfer within the microelectronics and printed circuit board \n(PCB) industries. The continual push to keep pace with \nMoore\u2019s Law [1] means that it is the subject of intense \nresearch. Projection optics used in sub-micron resolution \nlithography tools has a very narrow depth of field and so it is \nvital to position the substrate at the correct separation from \nthe reduction lenses. The same constraint applies to the \ncontact and proximity exposure tools favoured by PCB \nmanufacturers. Incorrect mask-substrate separation causes \ndiffractive line broadening and loss of resolution. This \nprecludes the use of photolithography in writing fine-pitch \npatterns onto non-planar substrates, such as micro-sensors, \nmicro-optical and micro-fluidic components, since it becomes \ndifficult to obtain an in-focus image over the entire 3D \ntopography. An alternative technique for these cases is to use \na direct-write tool, typically a laser, however this can be \nunattractive due to the lower throughput and extra capital \ncosts [2]. \nResolution enhancement techniques (RET) are being \ndeveloped for sub-micron lithography [3] and these suggest \nsome ways in which a mask pattern can be modified to enable \nhigh resolution to be maintained over a grossly non-planar \nsurface. The simplest enhancement is to modify the feature \ndimensions on the mask to compensate for the diffractive line \nbroadening. For instance, the projection of a 100\u00b5m line onto \nthe side wall of an anisotropically etched silicon wafer would \nrequire a tapering mask feature that started with a width of \n100\u00b5m and narrowed to (say) 90\u00b5m as the mask-substrate \nseparation increased. The exact amount of narrowing would \ndepend on the optical arrangement and the processing \nconditions for the photoresist. This technique has been shown \nto be successful for 140\u00b5m pitch connections over a 500\u00b5m \nstep on the actuators of inkjet print heads [2], but does not \ncope with more extreme situations. Christensen et al [4] \nachieved a minimum line pitch of 60\u00b5m for a similar \ngeometry. \nThe basis of the work presented in this paper can be \nconsidered as a substantial enhancement to another RET \ntechnique, namely the addition of sub-resolution assist \nfeatures around mask shapes. Assist features are effective \nbecause the light striking the mask has a degree of partial \ncoherence making it possible to generate constructive and\/or \ndestructive interference at the substrate surface and so modify \nthe projected line shapes. The extension of this idea to the \npatterning of grossly non-planar substrates requires \nconstructing the mask as something closer to a full hologram, \nso that, when illuminated with a sufficiently coherent light \nsource, the required non-planar light distribution is produced \n[5, 6]. \nComputer generated holograms \nThe traditional method of forming a hologram, recording \nthe interference between a reference laser beam and an object \nbeam on a light sensitive plate, requires a pre-existing master \nsubstrate that is already patterned with the required features. \nThis is the basis of a successful technique for the robust \npatterning of sub-micron features onto large flat panel \ndisplays that has been developed and commercialised by \nHoltronic [7]. However, the production of the master \nsubstrate is expensive and, for 3D geometries, can be very \ndifficult. The alternative is to compute the required hologram \nfor a given pattern and then use a standard mask writing tool \nto write the mask. This produces a computer-generated \nhologram (CGH). This is the basis for an x-ray projection \nlithography technique [8] in which the CGH is calculated \nusing an iterative search method similar to that developed by \nGerchberg-Saxton [9]. Unfortunately, this method cannot \nreadily be extended to complicated non-planar topologies and, \ntherefore, an alternative approach to the generation of the \nCGH is required. The patterns required for photolithography \nare generally composed of lines, rectangles and circles. These \nare simple shapes and it thus becomes possible to employ \nanalytical methods to determine the required CGH patterns. \nFr\u00e8re et al [10] have demonstrated a technique for \ndetermining analytically the CGH for line segments on flat \nand tilted surfaces and this has been extended to include \ncurved surfaces [11]. These analytical methods are \n1-4244-0152-6\/06\/$20.00 \u00a92006 IEEE 283 2006 Electronic Components and Technology Conference\ncomputationally less expensive than the iterative search \nmethods. \nThe iterative and analytical CGH methods generate \ncomplex functions that encode both the amplitude and the \nphase of the light emanating from each point on the mask. It \nis not possible to print these complex numbers directly, so \nquantisation of the functions is required first. The simplest \nquantisation scheme is to ignore the phase component and \nbinarise the amplitude component into either black (opaque) \nor white (clear). The resulting binary amplitude CGH can \nthen be produced using a standard chrome on glass mask \nblank. Alternatively, the phase components can be quantised \nand then realised by selective etching into a glass mask blank, \na technique that is already used for the production of phase \nshift masks (PSM). The functions must also be pixelated, with \nthe minimum pixel size being governed by the mask writing \ntool. Quantisation and pixelation both cause a degradation of \nthe quality of the image projected by the CGH. This may not \nbe an important issue for certain applications of CGHs, such \nas 3D-visualisation [10], however, the noise introduced by \nthese processes has presented a large hurdle to the use of \nCGHs for photolithography. \nPhotoresist deposition \nA second aspect to photolithography in three dimensions \nis the deposition and subsequent processing of a controlled-\nthickness photosensitive layer on the substrate surface. The \nstandard microelectronics photoresist deposition technique \nentails spinning a liquid precursor on to a wafer, whilst in the \nPCB industry dry-film resists are commonly used. Neither of \nthese methods is suitable for substrates that are not flat. Other \ntechniques that do offer some planarising potential include \ndipping and spraying, but the best candidate appears to be the \nuse of electro-depositable photoresist (EDPR). These \nproducts have been developed as a replacement to dry film \nresists [12], but have also found many applications within the \nMEMS domain (e.g. [13]). The EDPRs are deposited by \nmeans of a simple DC electroplating process, thus they \nrequire that the substrate has a conductive seed layer, which \ncan easily be deposited by electroless plating. The growing \nphotoresist film acts as an insulator, causing the deposition to \nbe self-limiting and resulting in a uniform thickness layer \nover the entire substrate, regardless of its shape. In these \nstudies, we have used Eagle 2100, a negative acting EDPR \nsupplied by Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials. A \ndeposition voltage of 150V produces a 5\u00b5m thick photoresist \nlayer. \nMask aligner \nThe optical arrangement used to project the CGH is \nsimilar to that for a standard soft-UV mask aligner, but with a \nlaser replacing the mercury arc lamp (Figure 1). This \nmodification is necessary because we require a more spatially \ncoherent light source with which to illuminate our CGHs. We \nrecognise, however that the suitably collimated beam from a \nUV arc lamp beam may be sufficiently coherent for some \napplications. For our studies, we have used a Coherent \u2018Cube\u2019 \ndiode laser producing 50mW at 403nm. The emission is not \nstrictly UV, but it does have a sufficiently short wavelength to \nexpose the photoresist. A spatial filter\/beam expander \nassembly produces a TEM00 mode beam that impinges on the \nCGH. We are investigating the incorporation of a refractive \nbeam re-shaper into the optical train to smooth the intensity \ndistribution across the beam whilst maintaining a constant \nphase profile. The substrate is positioned on an x, y, z, \u03b8 \nalignment stage. \nLaser Beam expander\nSubstrate\nComputer Generated\nHologram\nAlignment stage\nMirror\n  \nFigure 1 Optical arrangement for CGH projection \nThe same (attenuated) light source is used during the \nmask-substrate alignment. A special test substrate\/CGH \ncombination is used first to ensure that the beam propagation \ndirection is perpendicular to the CGH. The required CGH and \nsubstrate are then installed. Mask\u2013substrate alignment is \nachieved using the projection of special zone plates on to the \nedges of the substrate e.g. [14]. During this step, the central \nportion of the mask is obscured using a shutter. The alignment \nmarks allow x, y and \u03b8 alignment, as in a normal alignment \ntool, but uniquely they also permit z alignment, since they \nonly produce a definite spot at a particular separation z from \nthe mask. \nBasic CGH \nThe analytical equation for the hologram pattern that \ngenerates a line in space along the x-axis at distance z from \nthe mask is that of a cylindrical wave and is given by [10]: \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b= 2exp),( y\nz\njyxH \u03bb\n\u03c0    (1) \nHere, \u03bb is the wavelength of the illuminating radiation. The \nreal part of (1) is a chirp function along the y-axis (Figure 2a). \nIf we binarise the chirp function and truncate it in the x and y \ndirections with a rect function we obtain the binary amplitude \nCGH for a line in space (Figure 2b). \n \n0 1\n \n(a) (b) \nFigure 2 (a) The real part of H and (b) the resulting \nbinary amplitude CGH for a line in space  \n284 2006 Electronic Components and Technology Conference\nThe resulting image, formed at the focal length z when \nprojecting this CGH, is shown in Figure 3. \nFigure 3 Intensity distribution from binary amplitude \nCGH of a line in space \nA prominent line is obtained, but there are significant \nsecondary fringes, both to the sides and at the ends of the line. \nFigure 4 shows the intensity cross-section from this image.

We \nhave achieved this by patterning (using a dry etch technique) \na layer of PMMA spun onto a mask blank. The refractive \nindex of PMMA (n~1.5) means that a \u03c0-radians phase shift is \nachieved in a layer thickness equal to that of the illuminating \nradiation (403nm). The resulting projected image still has a \nsinc2 profile, but the signal to noise ratio from the binary \nphase pattern is 8.5 as opposed to 4.4 for the binary amplitude \npattern [15] (see Figure 7), increasing the manufacturing \nprocess latitude. \n \n285 2006 Electronic Components and Technology Conference\n \nFigure 7 Simulated intensity cross sections from binary \nphase and amplitude CGHs of lines in space \nIn binarising the CGH pattern, a crucial benefit has arisen \nin the suppression of the higher diffraction-order images \nformed by the mask. Typically, a CGH produces a number of \ncopies of the desired image centred at different spatial \nlocations. This corresponds to the \u201cspectral islands\u201d that arise \nwhen a continuous function is sampled. Continuing the \nanalogy, a CGH must then be sampled at a frequency high \nenough to separate the various image copies spatially, so that \nthe primary image can be recovered by appropriate filtering. \nThe upshot is that the minimum achievable mask-substrate \nseparation for a given CGH pixel spacing increases as the size \nof the image region increases; this figure can easily exceed \n1m for a typical PCB geometry. However, the use of binary \nline segment patterns such as that of Figure 6 and the higher \nimage-order suppression that results means that lines can be \nimaged at arbitrary mask-substrate separations. Although \nhigher image-orders may then interfere with other tracks \nimaged elsewhere, their low intensity means that the \nphotoresist can successfully filter out this effect. \nPseudo greyscale CGHs \nFigure 8 shows the comparison of simulated intensity \ndistribution of a line image from a binary amplitude CGH \nwith that of the ideal line. For these binary amplitude or phase \nmasks the intensity falls off as sinc2 on moving away from the \ncentre of the line, making control of line width within the \nphotolithographic process difficult. Additional side fringes \nare also present. \n \nFigure 8 Simulated intensity distribution from binary \namplitude or binary phase CGH \nBy calculating the complex-valued diffraction pattern \ngenerated by a well-defined rectangular feature at a given \norientation in space, rather than the distribution from a sinc2 \nline profile, a much more precisely defined feature can be \nimaged [17]. Unfortunately, the resulting diffraction pattern is \ndifficult to produce using conventional processes; a more \nreadily produced alternative is to take the real part of the \ncomplex distribution and capture this in the holographic \nmask. This results in a need to encode a range of greyscale \nvalues in the hologram, which has been achieved here using a \npseudo-greyscale technique whereby the area of the aperture \nat each pixel represents the grey level (Figure 9). Because the \nreal-valued diffraction pattern takes on both positive and \nnegative values, and because the introduction of a bias term to \noffset the negative parts of the mask results in additional \nunwanted noise in the image, it has also been found necessary \nto superimpose a binary phase layer (Figure 9 and Figure 10) \nto capture the full range of the real axis and to produce a \nsufficiently well defined image. \n \nFigure 9 Section of binary phase\/pseudo greyscale \namplitude CGH for a line in space \n \nFigure 10 Surface profile of section of a binary \nphase\/pseudo greyscale amplitude CGH mask \nThe resulting image (Figure 11) is much closer to that \nrequired, with much lower intensity side bands (Figure \n12). Note, however, that the use of apertures to modulate \nthe transmittance of the mask has led to the introduction of \nmore significant first-order images surrounding the \n \nChrome \n \nPMMA \nAperture with \nphase shift \nAperture \n286 2006 Electronic Components and Technology Conference\nprimary rectangular feature. The relative intensity of these \nfeatures is low, but they may present problems when \ncomplex images comprising many such rectangular shapes \nare created. \nFigure 11 A pseudo-colour intensity distribution from \nbinary phase\/pseudo greyscale CGH \n \nFigure 12 Intensity cross section for binary \nphase\/pseudo greyscale CGH \nUsing the intensity distribution in Figure 11 to expose the \nEPDR results in the metallised line (Figure 13), showing a \nmuch better line shape (width and definition of the end point) \nin comparison to patterned lines produced with the binary \nphase or amplitude masks (Figure 5). However, the lines \nformed still suffer from a regular width variation, \ncorresponding to the spatial frequency of the pixels in the \nmask. \n100\u00b5m  \nFigure 13 A gold line on silicon from binary \nphase\/pseudo greyscale CGH \nCGHs using slits \nThe regular width variation depicted in Figure 13 can be \neliminated by implementing the greyscale amplitude as \nvariable-width slits instead of apertures (Figure 14). This has \nthe effect of virtually eliminating the higher order features \nthat appear above and below the primary rectangular feature \nand Figure 15 demonstrates how the slit-based mask is able to \nproduce an extremely well defined rectangular feature. \nHowever, this approach does increase the intensity of the \nfirst-order rectangle images that appear to both sides (Figure \n16 and Figure 17). Once again though, care must be taken \nwith this approach since the higher image orders are liable to \ninterfere with additional features when multiple line segments \nare required. \nWe suggest that the suppression of higher order images \ncould be achieved by encoding grey scale intensity using \ngraded-opacity pixels rather than the binary apertures \ndescribed above, and that the signal to noise ratio could be \nfurther improved by extending the binary phase coding \nscheme to include multiple phase levels. \n \n \nFigure 14 Binary phase\/pseudo greyscale CGH using \nslits \n \n100\u00b5m  \nFigure 15: Gold line on silicon realised using binary \nphase\/slits greyscale CGH \n \n \nFigure 16 False colour intensity distribution from \nbinary phase\/slit greyscale CGH \n287 2006 Electronic Components and Technology Conference\n  \n \nFigure 17 Horizontal and vertical cross-sections of \nimages from slit amplitude\/binary phase CGH \nConclusions \nIn this paper, we have presented a method for achieving \nfine-pitch photolithography on non-planar surfaces. The \ntechnique is based on the use of computer-generated \nholograms to create a three-dimensional light distribution that \ncan be used to image virtually any topography. We have \nshown that our CGH enhancements make the projected image \nmuch more precise and by this means we can create a robust \nphotolithographic process. We have demonstrated the \npatterning of 100\u00b5m wide tracks over a 40mm step at large \ndistance from the mask. Many applications for the technique \ncan be envisaged in the fields of microelectronic and micro-\noptical packaging and MEMS device fabrication. These are \nthe subjects of ongoing research within our group. \nAcknowledgments \nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the UK \nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, who \nprovided funding for this work under grants GR\/S08336\/01 \nand GR\/S08329\/01.
