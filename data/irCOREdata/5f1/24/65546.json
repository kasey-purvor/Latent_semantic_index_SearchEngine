Introduction \nThe relationship between investment and cash flow has had a turbulent history. It was widely \nstudied in the 1950s and 1960s (Meyer and Kuh, 1957; Kuh, 1963, etc.) Yet cash flow \nsubsequently all but disappeared from the investment literature until its revival in the 1980s \nfollowing the development of models of asymmetric information, and an empirical \nbreakthrough in 1988 by Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (hereafter FHP). FHP (1988) \nestimated investment equations as a function of Tobin\u2019s Q and cash flow using firm-level \ndata1. They found that cash flow tends to have a bigger effect on the investment of firms \nmore likely to face financial constraints and interpreted this as evidence for the existence of \ninformation-driven capital market imperfections. A large literature on the relationship \nbetween cash flow and investment followed FHP\u2019s (1988) paper, many adopting similar \ntechniques (see Hubbard, 1998; and Bond and Van Reenen, 2005, for surveys). \nThe reasons why cash flow matters for investment, however, remains controversial. \nSome researchers have argued that instead of being caused by financing constraints, the \nrelationship between cash flow and investment could stem from the correlation between cash \nflow and omitted or mis-measured investment opportunities that are not captured by standard \nmeasures, particularly Tobin\u2019s Q (hereafter Q)2. Several attempts have been made at \nconstructing alternative measures of investment opportunities to test whether, once these \nopportunities are more adequately measured, cash flow still has a significant effect on firms\u2019 \ninvestment (see Gilchrist and Himmelberg, 1995; Erickson and Whited, 2000; Bond and \nCummins, 2001; Bond et al., 2004; and Cummins et al., 2006)3. \nThe use of Q is based on the idea that investment opportunities, which are forward \nlooking, can be captured by equity market participants, who are also forward looking. In \nparticular, securities\u2019 prices and therefore financial markets\u2019 evaluations of investment \nprospects are a keystone in papers based on the Q-theory. However, in the presence of \ninformation asymmetries in capital markets, a tension is immediately introduced by the use of \nQ. In such circumstances suppliers of external funds are unable to accurately assess firms\u2019 \ninvestment opportunities, and it is likely that there will be gaps in the information sets of the \n                                                 \n1 As marginal Q is not observable, it is generally proxied with average Q in empirical work. Hayashi (1982) \nillustrates the conditions under which the two measures are equivalent. \n2 As discussed in Bond and Cummins (2001) and Bond et al. (2004), this could happen if the Hayashi (1982) \nconditions are not satisfied or if Q is affected by measurement error, in the sense that stock market valuations \nare influenced by factors other than the present discounted value of expected future profits (e.g. bubbles). \n3 It has also been pointed out that holding constant investment opportunities, cash flow and investment could be \nlinked because managers tend to use internal funds for non-value-maximizing projects. This is the \u201cfree cash \nflow hypothesis\u201d (see Jensen, 1986; and Hubbard et al., 1995). \n 3\nfirm\u2019s insiders and outsiders4. Q will thus only capture outsiders\u2019 evaluation of opportunities. \nIt is possible that cash flow significantly affects investment simply because it is correlated \nwith the insiders\u2019 evaluation of opportunities, which are not captured by Q. \nThe principal contribution of this paper is to clarify the role of cash flow in \ninvestment equations by introducing, alongside Q, a new proxy for expectations reflecting the \nfirms\u2019 insiders\u2019 evaluation of opportunities, namely the firm\u2019s contractual obligations for \nfuture new investment projects. This variable should contain information about managers\u2019 \nforecasts of investment opportunities. To ensure that we capture information that is not \ncontained in Q as well, we use Q at the beginning of the period, but contracts for future \ninvestment in the period when they are announced. Including both Q and contracted capital \nexpenditure in our investment equations improves the degree to which investment \nopportunities are measured. If cash flow still plays a significant role on firms\u2019 investment, \nthen we can be more confident it is because of the role it plays in capturing the effects of \ncredit frictions.  \nAnother interesting aspect of our work is its contribution to the debate on the effects \nof financial constraints on investment, with a focus on the UK rather than the US. This is \nimportant because researchers debating the interpretation of cash flow tend to make use of \nUS data more often than European data5. \nWe use a panel of 693 UK firms over the period 1983 to 2000 to estimate investment \nregressions distinguishing firms into more and less likely to face financial constraints using \nemployees as a measure of size6. We initially regress investment on Q and cash flow, and \nfind that, although cash flow affects investment of both types of firms, its effect is stronger \nfor small firms. We then add, alongside Q, our variable measuring the firm\u2019s contractual \nobligations for future new investment. This ensures a more comprehensive measurement of \ninvestment opportunities. When this new variable is introduced, the explanatory power of \ncash flow falls for large firms, but remains unchanged for small firms. This suggests that at \nleast for the latter, the significance of cash flow in investment equations is likely to be caused \nby information asymmetries in the capital markets. \n                                                 \n4 An important theoretical paper serving as the foundation for the financing constraints literature, Myers and \nMajluf (1984), uses this argument to motivate the information asymmetries. \n5 Devereux and Schiantarelli (1990); Blundell et al. (1992); Bond and Meghir (1994); and, more recently, Bond \net al. (2003, 2004) looked at the effects of financial constraints on investment in the UK. For studies focusing on \nfirm investment and monetary policy transmission in the Euro area, see Chatelain et al. (2003), and Part II of \nAngeloni et al. (2003). \n6 Size is widely used in the literature as a criterion to partition firms into more and less likely to face financing \nconstraints (see for instance Devereux and Schiantarelli, 1990, Carpenter et al., 1994, 1998, etc.). \n 4\nThe rest of the paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 summarizes the main points of \ncontroversy about cash flow\u2019s role in determining firms\u2019 investment. Section 3 illustrates our \nbaseline specification and estimation methodology. Section 4 describes our data and presents \nsome summary statistics. Section 5 presents our econometric results. Section 6 concludes. \n \n2. Why does cash flow matter for investment? Summary of the principal points of \nthe controversy \nThe tight relationship between internal funds and investment is well known. As early as 1957, \nMeyer and Kuh stressed the importance of financial variables for investment and firms\u2019 \nseeming preference for internal funds. Research examining how firms\u2019 financing choices \naffected their investment was shelved in the 1960s, following the work by Modigliani and \nMiller (1958) and the extensive development of neoclassical models of investment (e.g., \nJorgenson, 1963; Hall and Jorgenson, 1967). The Q-theory of investment (Tobin, 1969; \nHayashi, 1982) can be seen as a reformulation of the neoclassical theory, according to which \ninvestment demand can be explained by the ratio between the market value of the firm\u2019s \ncapital stock and its replacement cost. Neither the neoclassical nor the Q-theory recognised \nany role of financial variables in determining investment.  \nThe importance of how investment is financed was revived with the development of \ntheoretical models of asymmetric information. Akerlof\u2019s (1970) landmark study on the role \nof asymmetric information in the market for \u201clemons\u201d broke with established economic \ntheory by illustrating how markets malfunction when buyers and sellers operate under \ndifferent information sets. Researchers recognised that similar arguments could be applied to \nfirms seeking funds from lenders (e.g., Stiglitz and Weiss, 1984).  \nIn 1988, Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen published an influential paper which had a \nsignificant methodological impact. They abandoned the representative firm assumption, and, \nusing firm-level US data, examined differences in the sensitivity of investment to cash flow \nacross groups of firms more or less likely to face financial constraints. This methodology \nallowed them to distinguish between different potential roles of cash flow. In particular, Q, \nwhich they included in their investment regressions as a proxy for firms\u2019 investment \nopportunities, might not properly measure them. If this were the case, they argued, then the \ncoefficients on cash flow could be biased due to the correlation between cash flow and \ninvestment opportunities, but one would expect the effects of cash flow on investment to be \napproximately equal for all groups of firms. \n 5\nAlternatively, cash flow could affect investment because capital markets are imperfect, \nand internal finance is cheaper than external finance. In this case, one would expect cash flow \nto play a stronger role on the investment of firms more likely to face financial constraints. \nLooking at the difference in the size of the cash flow coefficients for firms more and less \nlikely to face financial constraints would therefore provide useful evidence about the \nexistence of financial constraints.  \nFHP (1988) divided firms according to dividend policy, with high-dividend firms \nassumed less likely to face financial constraints. Their findings showed that cash flow tends \nto affect the investment of low-dividend firms significantly more than that of high-dividend \nfirms, supporting the hypothesis that cash flow affects firms\u2019 investment because of capital \nmarket imperfections.  \nAlmost immediately, research began to address the potential shortcoming of Q as \nmeasure of investment opportunities. One branch of literature \u201cdeparted from the strategy of \nusing proxies for marginal Q and relied on the Euler equation describing the firm\u2019s optimal \ncapital stock to model the investment decision\u201d (Hubbard, 1998, p. 209). In the absence of \nfinancial constraints, the standard Euler equation derived under the assumption of perfect \ncapital markets should hold. In the presence of financial constraints, on the other hand, the \nstandard Euler equation is mis-specified as financial variables belong in it. Whited (1992), \nHubbard et al. (1995), and Ng and Schaller (1996) estimated the standard Euler equation and \nan Euler equation augmented with financial variables for various categories of firms. Using \nUS data, they found that the standard Euler equation generally holds only for firms less likely \nto face financial constraints. Bond and Meghir (1994) reached a similar conclusion using UK \ndata.  \nAnother branch of literature attempted to identify the effect of capital market \nimperfections on investment without using Q as a measure of investment opportunities, but \nusing alternative measures of investment fundamentals. For instance, Gilchrist and \nHimmelberg (1995) estimated a set of VAR forecasting equations for a subset of information \navailable to the firm, and subsequently evaluated a linear expectation of the present \ndiscounted value of marginal profits, which they used as a measure of firms\u2019 investment \nopportunities7. They then estimated regressions of investment on the latter variable and cash \nflow. Since the informational content of cash flow as a forecasting variable is built in this \nnew measure of investment fundamentals, if the coefficient on cash flow remains significant \n                                                 \n7 Also see Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1999). \n 6\nonce the new variable is included in the investment regression, it is an indication of the \npresence of capital market imperfections. According to their results based on US data, the \nneoclassical model (without cash flow) only holds for firms less likely to face financial \nconstraints, whereas cash flow significantly enters the regressions of constrained firms. These \nfindings are in line with those in FHP (1988)8. \nAn important challenge to the findings in FHP (1988) came from Kaplan and Zingales \n(1997). These authors focused on the low-dividend sub-sample of firms used in FHP (1988) \nand reclassified these firms on the basis of their degree of financing constraints, using \ninformation contained in the firms\u2019 annual reports as well as management\u2019s statements on \nliquidity. They found that investment of firms that appear less financially constrained is more \nsensitive to cash flow than investment of other firms and concluded that higher sensitivities \nof investment to cash flow cannot be interpreted as evidence that firms are more financially \nconstrained. A heated debate followed the publication of Kaplan and Zingales\u2019 (1997) article: \nFHP (2000) criticized Kaplan and Zingales\u2019 (1997) classification scheme as flawed in \nidentifying both whether firms are constrained and the relative degree of constraints across \nfirm groups; Kaplan and Zingales (2000) responded to theses criticisms; examining a large \ncross-section of firms, Cleary (1999) measured financing constraints by a discriminate score \nestimate from several financial variables, and supported Kaplan and Zingales\u2019 (1997) results; \nand Allayannis and Mozumdar (2004) showed that the results in Kaplan and Zingales (1997) \nand Cleary (1999) are largely caused by financially distressed firms (such as firms with \nnegative cash flow) and\/or outliers9. \nA further challenge to FHP (1988) came with Bond and Cummins (2001), Bond et al. \n(2004), and Cummins et al. (2006), who used firm-specific earnings forecasts from securities \nanalysts to construct more accurate measures of the fundamentals that affect the expected \nreturns on investment. In their investment specifications, they found that if one controls for \nexpected profitability by using I\/B\/E\/S analysts\u2019 earnings forecasts, then the correlation \nbetween investment spending and cash flow disappears in all sub-samples of firms10. Similar \n                                                 \n8 Past this point, the controversy on how to interpret the role of cash flow appeared to simmer for a time, as the \nresearch agenda pursued how financing constraints affected different measures of firm activity including \ninventory investment (Carpenter et al., 1994, 1998; Guariglia and Schiantarelli, 1998; Guariglia, 1999, 2000; \nand Benito, 2005); employment (Nickell and Nicolitsas, 1999); and R&D (Himmelberg and Petersen, 1994; and \nBond et al., 1999). \n9 Using international data, Cleary (2006) supported Kaplan and Zingales\u2019 (1997) findings. Yet, Islam and \nMozumdar (2007) found that the distortionary effect of negative cash flow observations reported for US data by \nAllayannis and Mozumdar (2004) also extends to international data. \n10 As pointed out in Carpenter and Guariglia (2007), however, firms selected for coverage by I\/B\/E\/S analysts \nare not random, and are likely to be relatively profitable firms in industries of interest to I\/B\/E\/S customers. \n 7\nresults were obtained by Erickson and Whited (2000) who regressed investment on a measure \nof Q adjusted for measurement error, and cash flow11. \nThese challenges to the findings in FHP (1988) suggest that the controversy on what \nmight cause the observed correlation between investment and cash flow has not been \nresolved. \n \n3. Baseline specification and estimation methodology  \nOur baseline specification can be represented by the following Equation: \n \nIit \/Ki(t-1) = a0 + a1Ii(t-1) \/Ki(t-2) + a2 Qi(t-1)  + a3 CFit \/Ki(t-1) + error term    (1) \n \nwhere I is the firm\u2019s investment; K, the replacement value of its capital stock; Q, Tobin\u2019s Q; \nand CF, the firm\u2019s cash flow12. The subscript i indexes firms, and t, time, where t=1983-\n2000. Subsequently, we will add the contracted capital expenditure to capital stock ratio \n(CONK) as an additional regressor to this specification, and interact all regressors with \ndummy variables indicating whether firms are more or less likely to face financing \nconstraints. \nWe initially estimate Equation (1) using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator. \nYet, OLS estimates are likely to suffer from biases due to unobserved firm-specific \nheterogeneity, as well as possible endogeneity of the regressors. We therefore also present \nestimates obtained using a Within Groups estimator, which only account for the former \nbias13; estimates obtained using a pooled Instrumental Variables (IV) estimator, which only \naccounts for the latter bias; and estimates obtained using a Within Groups IV estimator, \nwhich accounts for both biases. Finally, we present estimates obtained using the first-\ndifference GMM estimator, proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991), which also controls both \nfor unobserved firm-specific heterogeneity and for the possible endogeneity of the regressors, \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFirms facing financing constraints are less likely to be followed by I\/B\/E\/S analysts. This might explain why \nauthors that used earning forecasts by I\/B\/E\/S analysts as measures of investment opportunities did not find \nsignificant effects of cash flow on investment. \n11 Gomes (2001) provides a theoretical challenge to the hypothesis that a significant coefficient on cash flow in \nan investment reduced-form regression can be seen as an indication of the existence of financial constraints \n(also see Abel and Eberly, 2002, 2004; Alti, 2003; Cooper and Ejarque, 2001, 2003; and Moyen, 2004). \n12 It is common practice in the literature to include in investment equations Q evaluated at the beginning of the \nperiod and cash flow evaluated at the end of the period (see Fazzari et al., 1988; Kaplan and Zingales, 1997 \netc.). \n13 For panels where the number of time periods is relatively small, the estimates obtained using the Within \nGroups estimator are inconsistent, as the transformed lagged dependent variable and the transformed error term \nare negatively correlated. This is generally referred to as the Nickell (1981) bias. \n 8\nbut which is typically more efficient than the Within Groups IV estimator. Specifically, we \ncan rewrite a more general version of Equation (1) as follows: \n \nyit = \u03b1yi(t-1) + \u03b2\u2019Xit + vi + vt + vjt + eit ,      (2) \n \nwhere y is the investment to capital ratio, and X, our set of explanatory variables (including \nTobin\u2019s Q and cash flow, but excluding the lagged dependent variable). The error term in \nEquation (2) is made up of the following components: vi, which denotes a firm-specific \ncomponent (encompassing any permanent additive measurement error); vt, which represents a \ntime-specific component (that we account for by including time dummies in all our \nspecifications); vjt, which represents an industry-specific time effect (that we account for by \nincluding time dummies interacted with industry dummies in all our specifications)14; and eit, \nwhich is an idiosyncratic component.  \nThe GMM panel estimator relies on first-differencing the estimating equation to \neliminate the firm-specific fixed effect, and uses appropriate lags of the right-hand side \nvariables as instruments. As can be seen from the following Equation, first-differencing (2) \nallows us to eliminate the firm-specific effect, vi: \n \nyit- yi( t-1) = \u03b1(yi(t-1) \u2013 yi( t-2)) + \u03b2\u2019(Xit- X i(t-1)) + (vt- vt-1) + \n+  (vjt- vj(t-1)) + (eit- ei( t-1))       (3) \n \nYet, in order to estimate Equation (3), instrumentation is still necessary to deal with the \npossible endogeneity of the regressors, and with the correlation between (yi(t-1) \u2013 yi(t-2)) and \n(eit- ei( t-1)). Assuming that eit is not serially correlated and that the regressors contained in X \nare weakly exogenous (meaning that they are uncorrelated with future realizations of the \nerror term), the GMM first-difference estimator uses the following moment conditions: \n \nE[yi(t-s) (eit- ei( t-1))]=0 for s\u22652; t=3,\u2026,18      (4) \n                                                 \n14 We include time dummies interacted with industry dummies, since there could be shifts in investment demand \nor expectations due to changes in industry-level conditions, such as industry demand shocks, or industry-wide \ntechnology changes (see Carpenter and Petersen, 2002). The dummies are aimed at controlling for those \nindustry-specific shifts in investment demand or expectations, and are included in addition to the standard time \ndummies defined at the aggregate level, which remove cyclical variation common to the entire manufacturing \nsector. Firms are allocated to one of the following seven industrial sectors: metals, metal goods, other minerals, \nand mineral products; chemicals and man made fibres; mechanical engineering; electrical and instrument \nengineering; motor vehicles and parts, other transport equipment; food, drink, and tobacco; textiles, clothing, \nleather, footwear, and others (Blundell et al., 1992). \n 9\nE[Xi(t-s)(eit- ei( t-1))]=0 for s\u22652; t=3,\u2026, 18      (5) \n \nThese moment conditions imply that values of y and of all the Xs lagged twice or more can be \nused as instruments in our regressions. Specifically, with reference to Equation (1), legitimate \ninstruments include Iit \/Ki(t-1), Qit, and CFit \/Ki(t-1) all lagged twice or more15.  \nConsistency of the GMM estimates depends on the validity of the instruments. We \ntest for the validity of our instruments by using two tests suggested by Arellano and Bond \n(1991): the J test and the test for second-order serial correlation of the residuals (m2). The \nformer is the Sargan test for overidentifying restrictions, asymptotically distributed as a chi-\nsquare with degrees of freedom equal to the number of instruments less the number of \nparameters, under the null of instrument validity. The m2 test is asymptotically distributed as \na standard normal under the null of no second-order serial correlation, and provides a further \ncheck on the specification of the model and on the legitimacy of variables dated t-2 as \ninstruments. \n \n4. Main features of the data and descriptive statistics \nThe data set \nThe data used in this paper consist of UK quoted company balance sheets collected by \nDatastream. We consider only the manufacturing sector. Investment (I) is measured as the \npurchase of fixed assets by the firm. Cash flow (CF) is obtained as the sum of the firm\u2019s \nafter-tax profits and depreciation. Our measure of the replacement value of capital stock (K) \nis derived from the book value of the firm\u2019s stock of net fixed assets, using the investment \ndata in a standard perpetual inventory formula. Q is calculated as the ratio between the sum \nof the market value of the firm and the firm\u2019s total debt and the replacement value of its \ncapital stock. Precise definitions of all variables used in the paper are presented in Table 1. \nWe started with 11536 annual observations (1113 firms) over the period 1980-2000. \nWe then excluded companies that changed the date of their accounting year-end by more than \na few weeks, so that the data refer to 12 month accounting periods. Moreover, when GMM is \nused, equations are estimated in first-differences, and values of the regressors lagged twice or \nmore are used as instruments. For this reason, considering that our estimating equation \ncontains lagged variables, at least three cross-sectional observations are needed for each firm \n                                                 \n15 The lag structure of the instruments in Qit also helps to control for the time-varying component of the \nmeasurement error, which is likely to affect this variable (see Erickson and Whited, 2000; and Bond and \nCummins, 2001, for a discussion of the measurement error likely to characterize Q). \n 10\nto allow the first-differencing process and the construction of the instruments. Thus, only \nfirms with a minimum of three consecutive observations were kept in the sample. This left us \nwith 10862 observations (955 firms). To control for the potential influence of outliers, we \ntruncated the sample by removing observations beyond the 1st and 99th percentiles for each of \nthe regression variables. We also excluded those observations characterized by an investment \nto capital stock ratio greater than one. These cut-offs are aimed at eliminating observations \nreflecting particularly large mergers, extraordinary firm shocks, or coding errors16. After \nthese adjustments, we were left with 10143 observations on 902 firms17. We then dropped \nfirm-years that did not have complete records on the variables used in our regressions, \nnamely the investment to beginning-of-period capital stock ratio, the lagged investment to \ncapital ratio, the cash flow to beginning-of-period capital stock ratio, lagged Q, the contracted \ncapital expenditure to beginning-of-period capital stock ratio, and the total number of \nemployees. This left us with a sample of 6308 observations for 693 firms over the period \n1983-2000, which is the sample used for the OLS and Within Groups estimates18. As GMM \nis based on the estimation of Equations (1) and (6) in first-differences, only 5615 \nobservations are used for the GMM estimates. Our sample has an unbalanced structure, with \nthe number of years of observations on each firm varying between three and 18. By allowing \nfor both entry and exit, the use of an unbalanced panel partially mitigates potential selection \nand survivor bias. \nTo test whether cash flow has a different impact on the investment of different types \nof firms, we partition firms according to whether they are more or less likely to face \nfinancing constraints using employees as a measure of size. In particular, we generate a \ndummy variable, SMALLit, which is equal to 1 if firm i has less than 250 employees in year t, \nand 0, otherwise19. We allow firms to transit between size classes20. To check robustness, we \nwill explore results for alternative cut-offs. \n                                                 \n16 These types of sample selection rules are quite common in the literature and we employ them to ensure \ncomparability with previous work (Bond et al., 2003; Cummins et al., 2006).  \n17 It should be noted that after removing the outliers, some firms ended up with less than three consecutive \nobservations, and had to be excluded for the sample. \n18 Once again, after removing those observations for which one or more of the regression variables were \nmissing, some firms ended up with less than three consecutive observations, and had to be excluded from the \nsample. \n19 A firm with less than 250 employees is much smaller than a typical \u201csmall\u201d US firm. However, this number is \nappropriate in a European context, where firms are typically smaller than in the US (see Bank of England, 2002, \nfor a discussion of various definitions of small, medium, and large firms). Our results were robust to using the \nfirms\u2019 total real assets as a measure for size. \n20 For this reason, our empirical analysis will focus on firm-years rather than simply firms. See Bond and \nMeghir (1994), Kaplan and Zingales (1997), Guariglia and Schiantarelli (1998), and Guariglia (2000) for a \nsimilar approach. \n 11\n \nThe contracted capital expenditure variable \nThe contracted capital expenditure variable (CONK), which we use as our new proxy for \nexpectations, reflects the insiders\u2019 evaluation of investment opportunities. It is defined as \ncontracts entered into for the future purchase of capital items, expenditure on machinery, \nequipment, plant, vehicles, and buildings, for which nothing has been paid by balance sheet \ndate. Every year, firms are required to provide this information together with their Financial \nStatements, following paragraph 50(3) of the Fourth Schedule to the Companies Act 1985, as \namended by the Companies Act 1989 and Statutory Instrument 1996 189. Contracted capital \nexpenditure has to be reported in the Notes to the firms\u2019 Financial Statements, generally \nunder the heading \u201cCapital Commitments\u201d. These Notes are added at the end of the firms\u2019 \nFinancial Statements: they help explain the computation of specific items in the Financial \nStatements and provide a more comprehensive assessment of companies\u2019 financial \nconditions21. Contracted capital expenditure is likely to transform itself into actual investment \nin the subsequent year, or in subsequent years if the contracts are long-term. Even if the \ncontracts are broken, the variable still contains information about managers\u2019 forecasts of \ninvestment opportunities.  \nAlthough contracted capital expenditure is unlikely to be a complete measure of the \nmanagers\u2019 expectations of future investment demand, as typically firms do not contract their \nentire expected future investment ahead of time, it is still reasonable to interpret this variable \nas an insider\u2019s expectation of future investment demand. We believe that proxying the firm\u2019s \ninvestment opportunities with outsiders\u2019 evaluation of these opportunities (Q), along with our \nmeasure of the firm\u2019s insiders\u2019 expectations of future investment demand gives a more \ncomprehensive assessment of the overall investment opportunities of the firm, than Q alone. \nIncluding CONK in our investment regressions should therefore reduce the chance that cash \nflow is significant only because it is correlated with investment opportunities not captured in \nQ. \nBeing a direct measure of the firm\u2019s managers\u2019 (insiders\u2019) expected future returns, our \ncontracted capital expenditure variable differs from the analysts\u2019 (outsiders\u2019) future earnings \nforecasts used by Bond and Cummins (2001), Bond et al. (2004), and Cummins et al. (2006). \nIt also differs from Gilchrist and Himmelberg\u2019s (1995) indirect measures of investment \nopportunities, which are derived from statistical methods. Contrary to these authors\u2019 \n                                                 \n21 As contracted capital expenditure is reported together with the firms\u2019 Financial Statements at the end of each \nyear, it can only be observed by outside investors and analysts at annual intervals.  \n 12\nmeasures of investment opportunities, our measure is not a substitute, but a complement to \nTobin\u2019s Q. Measuring the firm\u2019s investment opportunities in this \u201cextended\u201d way may \ntherefore reduce the likelihood that cash flow picks up investment opportunities in our \ninvestment regressions. \n \nSummary statistics \nTable 2 reports some descriptive statistics for the full sample and for the sub-samples of firm-\nyears with high and low employment. The first column of figures presents variable means for \nthe full sample, whereas columns (2) and (3) respectively refer to small and large firm-years. \nThe average firm-year has 5225.6 employees, whereas the average large firm-year has 6217.4 \nemployees, and the average small firm-year has 149.5 employees. Compared to large firm-\nyears, small firm-years generally have lower investment, cash flow, contracted capital \nexpenditure, and sales growth. For the small firm-years the investment to capital ratio is in \nfact 0.14, whereas it is 0.17 for the large ones. The corresponding figures for the cash flow to \ncapital ratio are 0.23 and 0.29; for the contracted capital expenditure to capital ratio, 0.02 and \n0.03; and for sales growth, 6.30 and 8.75. In contrast, small firm-years have a larger Q (4.11) \nthan high employment-firm years (3.15). The Table also shows that contracted capital \nexpenditure is a meaningful part of actual capital expenditure for both small and large firm-\nyears: the contracted capital expenditure to investment ratio is in fact equal to 0.20 for the \nformer and to 0.22 for the latter firm-years. The standard deviation of the same ratio is 0.75 \nfor small firm-years and 0.64 for large firm-years, suggesting bigger variations in the \npredictive power of contracted capital expenditure for the former.  \n \n5. Estimation results \nBaseline results \nTable 3 presents the estimates of Equation (1) for the full sample of firms. Column (1) reports \nthe OLS estimates22. The coefficients on the three regressors are statistically significant. In \nparticular, cash flow is positively associated with investment. The point estimate (0.094) \nindicates that the elasticity of investment with respect to cash flow, evaluated at sample \nmeans, is 0.162. A 10 percent increase in the cash flow to capital ratio leads therefore to a \n1.62 percent increase in investment. The R2 suggests that 41 percent of the total variance of \nthe investment to capital ratio is explained by the model. \n                                                 \n22 These estimates, as well as the pooled IV estimates, are adjusted for clustering. \n 13\nAs discussed in Section 3, the OLS estimates are however likely to suffer from biases \ndue to unobserved heterogeneity, and possible endogeneity of the regressors. Column (2) \nreports the estimates obtained using the Within Groups estimator, which controls for the \nformer bias. The \u03c1 coefficient, which represents the proportion of the total error variance \naccounted for by unobserved heterogeneity is equal to 0.31. This suggests that it is important \nto take unobserved firm-specific characteristics into account. The coefficient on the lagged \ndependent variable (0.171) is much smaller than the corresponding coefficient obtained in the \nOLS specification (0.336), which was obviously biased. The coefficient on cash flow is once \nagain positive and precisely determined. \nSince the OLS specification reported in column (1) may also be biased due to the \nendogeneity of the contemporaneous cash flow variable, we report the results based on a \npooled IV specification in column (3), where the instrument set is made up of the investment \nto capital ratio, Q, the cash flow to capital ratio, real sales, and employment, all lagged once. \nIn this specification, we can see that cash flow still has a positive and significant effect on \ninvestment. The J-statistic suggests that the instruments are valid23. \nThe specifications reported in columns (2) and (3) however, only take into account the \ntwo biases characterising the OLS specification individually. In column (4) of Table 3, we \npresent therefore the results of the estimation of our investment equation undertaken using a \nWithin Groups Instrumental Variables estimator, which takes the two biases simultaneously \ninto account, and uses the same instruments as in column (3). Once again, all three regressors \nattract positive and precisely determined coefficients. The point estimate of the cash flow \ncoefficient is 0.11, higher than the other three estimates previously discussed. It suggests that \na 10 percent increase in cash flow leads to a 1.94 percent rise in investment. The R2 suggests \nthat circa 36 percent of the total variance of the investment to capital ratio is explained by the \nmodel. \nFinally, in column (5) of Table 3, we present the estimates obtained with our preferred \nestimator, namely the first-difference GMM estimator. Our instrument se includes Iit \/Ki(t-1), \nQit, CFit \/Ki(t-1), real sales, and employment, all lagged two and three times. The estimated \ncoefficient on the lagged dependent variable lies between the corresponding estimates \nobtained using OLS and the Within Groups estimator. This suggests that our GMM estimator \n                                                 \n23 The J statistic is obtained by regressing the IV equations\u2019 residuals upon all the instruments and calculating \nthe statistic nRu2, where n is he number of observations and Ru2 is the uncentered R2. Under the null hypothesis \nthat all instruments are orthogonal to the error term, this statistic is distributed as a \u03c72 with degrees of freedom \nequal to the number of overidentifying restrictions (Baum et al., 2003). \n 14\nis unlikely to suffer from a weak instrument bias (see Bond et al., 2001)24. Once again, the \ncoefficient on the cash flow variable is positive and statistically significant. The point \nestimate (0.099) indicates that the elasticity of investment with respect to cash flow evaluated \nat sample means is 0.155, suggesting that a 10 percent rise in cash flow is associated with a \n1.55 percent increase in investment. The coefficients associated with the lagged dependent \nvariable, Q, and cash flow are comparable to those obtained in previous studies that focused \non investment behavior in the UK (see Devereux and Schiantarelli, 1990; Blundell et al., \n1992; Bond et al., 2004). The J and m2 statistics suggest that the instruments are valid and \nthat there is no gross mis-specification in the model. The GMM first-differenced estimator \nwill be used in the estimation of all the specifications to follow. \n All the specifications reported in Table 3 indicate that there is a positive relationship \nbetween cash flow and investment, similar to results obtained in previous studies for the UK \nand other countries. It is also important to note that the point estimates for cash flow are \nquantitatively robust to the choice of estimator. But is this positive correlation caused by \ninformation asymmetries in capital markets that may lead to financing constraints, or by the \nrelationship between cash flow and investment opportunities not captured by Q? \n \nIntroducing contracted capital expenditure and allowing for firm heterogeneity \nWe now estimate the following more general regression denoting the firm\u2019s contracted \ncapital expenditure as CONK: \n \nIit \/Ki(t-1) = a0 + a1Ii(t-1) \/Ki(t-2) + a2 Qi(t-1)  + a3 CFit \/Ki(t-1) + a4 CONKit \/Ki(t-1) + error term (6) \n \nContracted capital expenditure is measured at end of period, and captures expectations of \nfuture profits known to insiders, which are not included in beginning of period Q. Adding this \nvariable to our investment specifications alongside Q is likely to ensure that both the insiders\u2019 \nand the outsiders\u2019 evaluations of investment opportunities are accounted for in the regression. \nIncluding contracted capital expenditure should reduce the size of the cash flow coefficient if \ncash flow contains omitted expectations of investment demand. If the cash flow term remains \nstatistically significant, then this is likely to be due to information asymmetries in capital \nmarkets, leading to financing constraints.  \n                                                 \n24 For this reason, we do not report the estimates obtained using the system-GMM estimator developed in \nBlundell and Bond (1998). These, however, are available from the authors upon request. \n 15\nColumn (1) of Table 4 presents the GMM estimates of our extended investment \nmodel for the aggregate sample. We can see that the coefficient on CONKit \/Ki(t-1) is positive \nand both statistically and economically significant: contracted capital expenditure clearly has \ninformation about firm investment embedded in it. Since the coefficient estimate on the Q \nvariable is similar to that reported in column (5) of Table 3, one can conclude that the \nvariation of Q and CONK is largely orthogonal and that the information in CONK is not \ncontained in Q. It also appears that the coefficient on the cash flow variable remains \nstatistically significant, but drops from 0.089 in the model without contracted capital \nexpenditure to 0.079 in the extended model. The fact that cash flow remains positively \nassociated with investment, even after controlling for investment opportunities, considering \nboth the outsiders\u2019 and the insiders\u2019 evaluation of these opportunities, suggests that it might \nplay a role in capturing the severity of financial constraints.  \n If financial factors drive the positive relationship between cash flow and investment, \nthen one would expect this relationship to be stronger for those firms more likely to face \nfinancial constraints. We estimate our investment equation interacting all the right hand side \nvariables with the dummies SMALLit and (1-SMALLit). This formulation allows the \nparameters of the model to differ across observations in the two sub-samples. We initially \nestimate the model including only lagged investment, Q, and cash flow, all interacted with \nthe dummies SMALLit and (1-SMALLit). Our instrument set includes the interactions of Iit \/Ki(t-\n1), Qit, and CFit \/Ki(t-1) with the size dummies, and real sales and employments, all lagged \ntwice.  \nThe results are reported in column (2) of Table 4. Cash flow is positively and \nsignificantly associated with investment, for both small and large firm-years. The Table \nreports the p-value associated with an F-test aimed at assessing whether the impact of cash \nflow on investment is the same for small and large firm-years. Although the hypothesis \ncannot be rejected, the coefficient is larger for small firm-years: the elasticities evaluated at \nsample means suggest that a 10 percent rise in cash flow is associated with a 1.44 percent \nincrease in investment for small firm-years, and with a 1.28 percent increase for large firm-\nyears. This supports the hypothesis that financial variables positively affect investment as a \nconsequence of capital market imperfections. It should be noted, however, that in this \nparticular specification, cash flow could also proxy for investment opportunities. The J and \n 16\nm2 tests do not indicate any problems with the specification of the model and the choice of \nthe instruments25.  \nOur next specification includes contracted capital expenditure interacted with the size \ndummies as additional regressors to improve the measurement of investment opportunities. \nThe GMM estimates of this extended model are presented in column (3) of Table 4. The \ncoefficient on cash flow for large firm-years is now much smaller than in the previous \nspecification and no longer significant at the 5 percent level. On the other hand, the \ncorresponding coefficient for small firm-years remains precisely determined and rises \nslightly: it suggests that a 10 percent rise in cash flow is associated with a 1.6 percent rise in \ninvestment26. The coefficient on the contracted capital expenditure variable is statistically \nsignificant and economically important for both types of firm-years: it is equal to 1.39 for \nlarge firm-years, and to 0.64 for small firm-years. This confirms that contracted capital \nexpenditure has information about firm investment embedded in it. In addition, the \ncoefficient estimates on the Q variables are similar between columns (2) and (3), suggesting \nonce again that the information in CONK is not contained in Q. As in the previous \nspecification, the J and m2 tests do not indicate any problems with the specification of the \nmodel or the choice of the instruments. \nTo formally test whether the inclusion of the contracted capital expenditure variables \nimproves the specification of our investment model, we present a test of the extended \ninvestment model (which includes the contracted capital expenditure variables) versus the \nparsimonious one (without contracted capital expenditure variables)27. This test involves the \nconstruction of the chi-squared statistic suggested by Newey and West (1987). If a model is \nincorrectly specified, the J test for that model will tend to be relatively large. The difference \nin the J statistics between the model with and without the contracted capital expenditure \nvariables, holding the weighting matrix fixed can be seen as a test of whether the \nimprovement of specification which takes place when contracted capital expenditure is added \nis statistically significant28. The difference between the two J statistics is distributed as a chi-\n                                                 \n25 Similar results, not reported for brevity, but available from the authors upon request, were obtained if separate \nregressions were estimated for small and large firms using either the average number of employees over the \nsample period, or the pre-sample number of employees as sample separation criteria.  \n26 Although, according to our F-test, the difference in magnitude between the cash flow coefficient at small and \nlarge firm-years is not statistically significant, the latter coefficient is no longer precisely determined. \n27 The null hypothesis is that the parsimonious model is acceptable, i.e. that there is no significant improvement \nin the specification of the model once the contracted capital expenditure variables are added. \n28 The instruments that we chose provide a set of moment restrictions of the following type: E(Zjiteit)=0, where \nZjit is the j-th instrument for firm i in year t, and eit is the idiosyncratic error term. The GMM estimator \nminimizes a quadratic form, in the corresponding sample moments, using a weighting matrix given by a \n 17\nsquared with two degrees of freedom29. The Newey-West statistic is in our case 2134.46, \nwhich is obviously statistically significant. This shows that there is a clear improvement in \nthe specification of our investment model if contracted capital expenditure is added (also see \nNg and Schaller, 1996, who make use of a similar test). \nOur results suggest that for large firms, there is some evidence that the positive \nassociation between cash flow and investment in the model that only includes lagged \ninvestment, Q, and cash flow as explanatory variables is caused by the correlation between \ncash flow and investment opportunities that are not properly captured by Q. The association \nbecomes in fact weaker once the contracted capital expenditure variables are included in the \nregression. On the other hand, for small firms, the relationship between cash flow and \ninvestment is more likely to be caused by information asymmetries in the capital markets. \nOnce the contracted capital expenditure variables are introduced in the model, cash flow \nremains in fact statistically significant, and its coefficient does not significantly drop. This \ncan be seen as evidence in favor of the controversial hypothesis that financing constraints \nplay a crucial role in explaining the positive link between cash flow and investment. \n \nRobustness checks \nA number of researchers who participated to the debate on the role of cash flow in explaining \ninvestment estimated specifications which did not include the lagged dependent variable as a \nregressor (see FHP, 1988; Kaplan and Zingales, 1997 etc.). To better compare our study and \ntheirs, we estimated a GMM investment equation similar to that in column (3) of Table 4, but \nexcluding the variables involving the lagged investment to capital ratio both from the set of \nregressors and from the instrument set. The results of this new specification are reported in \ncolumn (1) of Table 5. Similarly to the specification in column (3) of Table 4, the coefficient \non cash flow is only significant for small firm-years, and the coefficient on the contracted \ncapital expenditure variable is significant for both small (at the 10 percent significance level) \nand large (at the 5 percent level) firm-years. In spite of these similarities, the J test only has a \nmarginal significance of 0.034, suggesting that the omission of the lagged dependent variable \ncauses mis-specification in the model. \n                                                                                                                                                        \nconsistent estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the moment restrictions themselves. See Arellano and \nBond (1998) for more details. \n29 More in general, the degrees of freedom of the \u03c72 statistic are given by the number of omitted parameters in \nthe parsimonious model. Since the two models that we are comparing differ only by the presence of the two \nvariables in contracted capital expenditure, we consider a \u03c72 statistic with two degrees of freedom. \n 18\n Furthermore, we tested the robustness of our results to different criteria for splitting \nthe sample between firm-years more and less likely to face financial constraints. Our main \ncriterion defines in fact a firm as small in a given year if its total number of employees in that \nyear is less than or equal to 250. We have tried to use other benchmark employment levels to \nclassify firms into small and large, namely 200 and 300. As shown in columns (2) and (3) of \nTable 5, this has left our main results largely unchanged. Column (4) further shows that our \nresults are robust to classifying firm i as small in year t if its total number of employees falls \nin the bottom quartile of the distribution of the number of employees of all firms operating in \nthe same industry as firm i in year t, and as large otherwise. \n As a further robustness test, in column (5) of Table 5, we replaced the end-of-period \ncontracted capital expenditure variable interacted with the size dummies with the same \nvariable evaluated at the beginning of the period. Although in this case there might be some \noverlap in the information contained in the latter variable and Q, evaluating both variables at \ntime t-1 ensures that the information sets of managers and market are at least potentially the \nsame. The results are again qualitatively similar to those reported in column (3) of Table 4. \nThe coefficient associated with cash flow is precisely determined for both small and large \nfirm-years, but larger for the former.  \n Finally, in column (6) of Table 5, we re-estimated our main investment model using a \nbroader sample, which includes those observations with a ratio of investment to capital \ngreater than one. Once again, the coefficient associated with cash flow is statistically \nsignificant (at the 5 percent level) only for small firm-years. On the other hand, the contracted \ncapital expenditure variable now only attracts a precisely determined coefficient for large \nfirm-years. \n Once the firms\u2019 investment opportunities are accounted for in a more comprehensive \nway by including the contracted capital expenditure variables in the regression (in addition to \nQ) the explanatory power of cash flow falls for large firms but remains unchanged for small \nfirms. Overall our results support the view that the investment of small firms is constrained \nby access to internal finance, while this is not the case for large firms. \n \n6. Conclusion \nThis paper sheds light on the controversial role played by cash flow in investment \nregressions. The debate is centred around understanding whether cash flow is an important \ndeterminant of investment because of its role in alleviating credit frictions or because it \nproxies for omitted or mis-measured investment opportunities. \n 19\nWe used a panel of 693 UK firms over the period 1983-2000 to estimate investment \nequations as a function of lagged investment, Q, cash flow, and contracted capital \nexpenditure. We argued that because in the presence of asymmetric information, gaps are \nlikely to exist between the information sets of the firm\u2019s insiders and outsiders, Q is an \nimperfect measure of the firm\u2019s investment opportunities, as it only captures the equity \nmarket participants\u2019 (outsiders\u2019) evaluation of these opportunities. To improve the \nmeasurement of investment opportunities, we included the firm\u2019s contractual obligations for \nfuture new investment projects as an additional proxy. This variable is important as it \ncaptures information about opportunities available only to insiders and thus not measured in \nQ. Introducing it in our investment regressions alongside Q indeed improves the degree to \nwhich investment opportunities are measured. We found that when Q and the firm\u2019s \ncontracted capital expenditure variable were both included in our regressions, the explanatory \npower of cash flow fell for large firms, but remained unchanged for small firms. Our results \nsuggest that while cash flow may contain information about investment opportunities not \ncaptured in Q, the significance of cash flow in investment equations stems from its role in \ncapturing the effect of credit frictions. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe wish to thank two anonymous referees; and the participants at presentations at the 2003 \nRoyal Economic Society Annual Conference, the workshop \u201cInnovare per competere.
