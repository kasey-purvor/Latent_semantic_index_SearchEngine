This distinction is supported by findings from \nstudies showing that recollection and familiarity can be dissociated \nexperimentally. For example, recollection is more sensitive than familiarity to \nlevels-of-processing manipulations (e.g., Gardiner, 1988; Khoe, Kroll, \nYonelinas, Dobbins, & Knight, 2000; Mulligan & Hirshman, 1995) and \ndivided attention (e.g., Gardiner & Parkin, 1990; Jacoby & Kelley, 1992; \nJacoby, Woloshyn, & Kelley, 1989), while familiarity is more sensitive than \nrecollection to modality changes between study and test (e.g., Gregg & \nGardiner, 1994; Toth, 1996). There is also evidence that recollection and \nfamiliarity are supported by different brain regions. For example, findings \nfrom several studies indicate that recollection is dependent on the \nhippocampus while familiarity is dependent on the surrounding medial \ntemporal lobe regions (e.g., Aggleton & Brown, 1999; Tulving & \nMarkowitsch, 1998; Yonelinas, Kroll, Dobbins, Lazzara, & Knight, 1998). \nRecollection and familiarity can thus can be dissociated both behaviorally and \nin terms of their underlying neural substrates (see Yonelinas, 2002, for a \nreview).  \n The view that recognition memory involves two processes has also \nbeen investigated using the remember-know procedure (Gardiner, 1988; \nTulving, 1985). This procedure capitalizes on the fact that recollection and \nfamiliarity can be distinguished on the basis of subjective experience. In \nremember-know studies, participants are instructed to categorize each positive \n4 \nrecognition decision as either a remember (R) response if they can consciously \nrecollect the item\u2019s study presentation, or a know (K) response if they \nrecognize the item on the basis of familiarity but cannot consciously recollect \nits study presentation. The distinction between remembering and knowing was \noriginally used to describe the states of awareness that characterize retrieval \nfrom episodic and semantic memory respectively (Tulving, 1985). However, \nsubsequent findings have often been interpreted within a dual-process \nframework (e.g., Dewhurst & Anderson, 1999; Dewhurst & Hitch, 1999; \nJacoby, Yonelinas, & Jennings, 1997; Rajaram, 1993, 1996; Yonelinas, 2002).  \n Although the distinction between remembering and knowing is \nconsistent with the view that recognition memory involves two separate \nprocesses, some studies that have used the remember-know procedure have \nproduced findings that are inconsistent with the predictions of dual-process \nmodels. For example, dual-process models attribute the word frequency effect \n(WFE) in recognition memory (better recognition of low-frequency than high-\nfrequency words) to a greater enhancement of familiarity for the low-\nfrequency words following their study presentation (e.g., Jacoby & Dallas, \n1981; Mandler, 1980). However, Gardiner and Java (1990) found a WFE in R \nrather than K responses, suggesting that word frequency influences \nrecollection rather than familiarity (see Dewhurst, Hitch, & Barry, 1998, for \nsimilar findings). This is consistent with the view that the WFE reflects the \ngreater distinctiveness of low-frequency words (Glanzer & Adams, 1990; \nRajaram, 1996; Reder, Nhouyvanisvong, Schunn, Ayers, Angstadt, & Hikari, \n2000). \n The aim of the present study was to investigate a further discrepancy \nbetween dual-process models and remember-know studies concerning the \n5 \nrelative speed of the recollection and familiarity processes. According to dual-\nprocess models, familiarity is a rapid and automatic process that places \nrelatively low demands on cognitive resources, whereas recollection is a \nslower and more effortful process that places greater demands on cognitive \nresources (e.g., Atkinson & Juola, 1974; Jacoby, 1991; Mandler, 1980, 1988; \nYonelinas & Jacoby, 1994, 1996). This view is supported by the findings of \nHintzman and Caulton (1997) that under speeded test conditions participants \ncan make old\/new decisions more rapidly than they can make judgements that \nrequire recollection of the learning episode. Further support for this position is \nprovided by the findings of Boldini, Russo, and Avons (2004) who used a \nspeed-accuracy trade-off procedure to separate the recollection and familiarity \nprocesses. They found that modality matches (assumed to influence \nfamiliarity) enhanced recognition with early response deadlines, while deep \nprocessing (assumed to influence recollection) enhanced recognition with late \nresponse deadlines. However, findings from remember-know investigations \nare inconsistent with the view that familiarity is faster then recollection. For \nexample, Gardiner, Ramponi, and Richardson-Klavehn (1999) found that R \nresponses can be made as rapidly as K responses under speeded test \nconditions. Participants in this study were trained to make old\/new decisions \nwithin an early (500 msec) or late (1500 msec) response deadline, before \nmaking R\/K decisions for items judged as old. Gardiner et al. found effects of \nlevels-of-processing and generation in R responses at both early and late \nresponse deadlines and concluded that R as well as K responses can be \ntriggered automatically. More recently, Konstantinou and Gardiner (in press) \nextended the response deadline procedure to face recognition and again found \n6 \neffects of levels-of-processing in R responses with both early and late \nresponse deadlines.  \n Further evidence that recollection can be triggered automatically \ncomes from response time (RT) studies showing that R responses are made \nmore rapidly than K responses. For example, Dewhurst and Conway (1994) \ninstructed participants to make old\/new decisions followed by R\/K decisions \nto items judged as old. They found that old judgements were made more \nrapidly to items that were subsequently categorized as R responses rather than \nK responses (see Dewhurst et al., 1998, for similar findings). Dewhurst and \nConway argued that R responses have an all-or-none quality while K \nresponses have to undergo post-retrieval processing in order to determine their \nfamiliarity relative to other items in the test list. Similar findings were reported \nby Henson, Rugg, Shallice, Josephs, and Dolan (1999) who instructed \nparticipants to make R, K, or new (N) judgements to test items. They found \nthat both R and N judgements were associated with faster RTs than K \njudgements. Henson et al. suggested that the slower RTs for K responses \nreflect the difficulty of making old judgements without the recollection of \ncontextual details, and that such decisions are particularly effortful when test \nitems evoke a degree of familiarity that falls on the K\/N threshold. \n In his review of dual-process models, Yonelinas (2002) argued that the \nslower RTs for K responses are an artefact of instructions that ask participants \nto make a K response only if an item is not recollected. He suggested that such \ninstructions encourage participants to wait until both processes are completed \nbefore making their decision. If the slower RTs for K responses are merely \ndue to demand characteristics, then the findings have little empirical or \ntheoretical value. However, if the RTs reflect genuine differences in the speed \n7 \nof the underlying processes, then they have clear implications for models of \nrecognition memory.  \n The present study investigated the relative speed of remembering and \nknowing by measuring RTs in a series of variations on the remember-know \nprocedure. Experiments 1 and 3 used the procedure introduced by Dewhurst \nand Conway (1994) in which participants made a timed old\/new followed by \nan untimed R\/K decision for each item before proceeding to the next item. \nPositive recognition decisions were divided into R and K responses and RTs \nto the old\/new decision were compared. This is what Eldridge, Sarfatti, and \nKnowlton (2002) have referred to as a two-step procedure, whereby \nparticipants make separate old\/new and R\/K decisions before moving on to the \nnext item. Experiment 1 also included a one-step condition (Eldridge et al., \n2002) in which participants made a timed R\/K decision without a preceding \nold\/new decision. Experiment 2 attempted to decouple the R\/K decision from \nthe old\/new decision by instructing participants to make old\/new decisions to \nthe full set of test items before seeing them a second time and making R\/K \njudgements for each item previously judged as old. \n Experiments 1 and 2 also included a word frequency manipulation. As \nnoted above, the presence of the WFE in R responses is counter to the \npredictions of dual-process models, which attribute the recognition advantage \nfor low-frequency words to a greater enhancement of familiarity following \ntheir study presentation (Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Mandler, 1980). However, it \nis possible that the presence of the WFE in R responses is an artefact of the \ntwo-step remember-know procedure in which decisions of subjective \nexperience are made only after a speeded old\/new decision has been made. If \nfamiliarity is faster than recollection, it is possible that old\/new decisions are \n8 \nbased on familiarity and that items initially recognized on that basis are \nsubsequently categorized as R responses when the slower recollection process \nhas been completed. Comparison of the one-step and two-step procedures \nallowed us to investigate this possibility. The presence of the WFE in R \nresponses was also taken to indicate the consistent use of R and K response \ncategories in the different test conditions. In previous RT investigations, \nvariables that influenced hit rates in R and K responses did not affect RTs \n(Dewhurst & Conway, 1994; Dewhurst et al., 1998). This may also be an \nartefact of the two-step procedure. We therefore included word frequency as \nan independent variable in the analysis of RTs. The exception to this was \nExperiment 3, which used a words-versus-nonwords manipulation. The \nrationale for this is explained in the introduction to Experiment 3.  \nExperiment 1 \n The aims of Experiment 1 were (i) to confirm previous findings that \nold\/new decisions are faster for items subsequently categorized as R responses \nthan for items subsequently categorized as K responses and (ii) to test whether \nthis finding is an artefact of the two-step remember-know procedure. One \ngroup of participants followed the two-step procedure used by Dewhurst and \nConway (1994). In the analysis of RTs, hits were divided into R and K \nresponses on the basis of the second response and RTs to the old\/new decision \nwere compared. A second group of participants followed the one-step \nprocedure whereby they made R\/K decisions without a preceding old\/new \ndecision. Eldridge et al. suggested that the one-step procedure leads \nparticipants to adopt a more liberal response criterion. However, in their \nsecond experiment they found that giving participants a guess response option \nin addition to R and K enabled participants to make responses that were not \n9 \nbased simply on trace strength (see also Gardiner, Java, & Richardson-\nKlavehn, 1996). We therefore included a guess (G) option in addition to R and \nK.  \n Hicks and Marsh (1999) found that the one-step procedure introduced \na liberal response bias whereby correct and false R and K responses increased \nrelative to the two-step procedure. They suggested that a single R\/K\/N \ndecision is the more difficult procedure as it requires participants to choose \nbetween three options. The two-step procedure involves only binary decisions \nand is therefore the easier of the two. We therefore expected RTs to the R\/K \ndecision in the one-step procedure to be slower than RTs to the yes\/no \ndecision in the two-step procedure. The effects of word frequency in hits, false \nalarms, and RTs were also investigated.  \nMethod \n Participants. Fifty six undergraduate volunteers from Lancaster \nUniversity took part in Experiment 1. All were native English speakers. They \nwere tested at individual work stations in groups of between five and eight and \nwere paid for their participation.  \n Stimuli and Design. Stimuli consisted of 40 high-frequency words and \n40 low-frequency words selected from Kucera and Francis (1967). The high-\nfrequency words had a frequency count of at least 100 occurrences per million \nand the low-frequency words had a count of less than 10 per million. The \nwords were divided into two lists, each comprising 20 high-frequency and 20 \nlow-frequency words. One list was presented to participants at encoding and \npresented as targets in the recognition test. The other was used for lure items \nin the recognition test. Half the participants studied list 1 and the remainder \nstudied list 2. Study items were presented in a different random order for each \n10 \nparticipant. The order of test items was also randomized separately for each \nparticipant. The dependent measures were the number of R, K, and G \nresponses given in the recognition test and their respective response times.  \n Procedure. Study items were presented one at a time on Apple \nMacintosh computers. Each word remained on the screen for 1 second with an \nintertrial interval of 1.5 seconds. Participants were instructed to read the words \nsilently in preparation for a memory test, the nature of which was not \nspecified. After all the words had been presented, participants were engaged in \na nonverbal distractor task (solving arithmetic problems) for 10 minutes and \nwere then given the instructions for the recognition test. Participants were \ninformed that they were about to see another sequence of words, some of \nwhich had appeared in the previous set. Their task was to identify the words \nthat appeared in the earlier set by pressing the appropriate response key on the \nnumberpad on the right hand side of the keyboard. Participants then received \ninstructions for R, K, and G responses (taken from Dewhurst & Anderson, \n1999). Briefly, they were told to make an R response if they could consciously \nrecollect seeing an item in the study list and could recall contextual details \nsuch as associations or images generated at the time. They were told to make a \nK response if a word felt familiar from the study list but they could not \nrecollect any details of its previous occurrence. They were told to make a G \nresponse if they were unable to decide if a word had appeared or not. \n Participants in the two-step condition were instructed to press 1 for an \nold item and 2 for a new item. They were told that if they made a positive \ndecision, a prompt would appear on the screen asking them to press R for \nremember, K for know, or G for guess. The words and the R\/K\/G prompt \nremained on the screen until a keypress was made. The R\/K\/G prompt \n11 \nappeared 500 ms. after the old\/new response, and trials were separated by a 2 \nsecond interval. Participants were instructed to make the old\/new decision as \nquickly and as accurately as possible but to take as long as they needed for the \nremember\/know decision.  \n The one-step condition featured a go \/ no go procedure. Participants in \nthis group were instructed to press the 1 key if they could recollect seeing an \nitem in the study list (remember response) or the 2 key if the item felt familiar \nfrom the study list (know response). This pattern was reversed for half the \nparticipants. Participants were instructed to press the space bar with their left \nhand if their response was a guess. They were asked to make the R\/K decision \nas quickly and as accurately as possible. They were told not to make a \nresponse if they did not recognize the item, in which case it would be removed \nfrom the screen after five seconds. Items remained on the screen for five \nseconds or until a response key was pressed. Test items were separated by a \ntwo second interval.   \nResults and Discussion \n Table 1 shows the mean RTs and mean proportions of correct and false \nR, K, and G responses. Note that RTs for the two-step condition represent the \nmean latencies for \u201cold\u201d judgements divided into R and K responses on the \nbasis of the untimed R\/K decision, while RTs in the one-step procedure \nrepresent mean latencies for R and K responses without a preceding old\/new \ndecision. Alpha was set at .05 in all statistical analyses. Guess responses were \nnot included in the analyses as they were produced by only a subset of \nparticipants and are typically made below chance levels (Gardiner, Ramponi, \n& Richardson-Klavehn, 2002). However, their proportions and RTs are \nincluded in the tables for comparison with R and K responses. Prior to their \n12 \nstatistical analysis, the RTs from all participants were collated and outliers \n(RTs greater than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean) were identified. \nOutliers were calculated separately for R, K, and G responses and removed \nfrom the individual data files. A total of 22 outliers were removed from the \ntwo-step condition (11 R, 9 K, and 2 G responses) and 25 from the one-step \ncondition (15 R and 10 K). These represented less than 5% of the total number \nof responses.  \nPlease insert Table 1 about here \n A preliminary analysis of RTs consisted of a 2x2x2 (Group x \nFrequency x Response Type) mixed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) \nconducted on data from participants who made correct responses in each of \nthe four cells created by crossing Frequency (high versus low) and Response \nType (R versus K). This confined the analysis to 45 of the 56 participants (23 \nin the two-step procedure and 22 in the one-step procedure). Frequency did \nnot significantly influence RTs and did not interact with Response Type, F < 1 \nin both cases. For the two-step condition, the mean RTs for R responses (in \nms) were 995 for high-frequency and 1029 for low-frequency, while the mean \nRTs for K responses were 1300 for high-frequency and 1254 for low-\nfrequency. In the one-step condition, mean RTs for R responses were 1221 for \nhigh-frequency and 1177 for low-frequency, while the mean RTs for K \nresponses were 1672 for high-frequency and 1796 for low-frequency.  \nThe RT data were therefore collapsed across Frequency and entered \ninto a 2x2 mixed ANOVA with Group (one-step versus two-step) as a \nbetween-groups factor and Response Type (R versus K) treated as a within \nfactor. One participant in the one-step condition did not make any correct K \nresponses, therefore the data from that participant were omitted from the \n13 \nanalysis of RTs. The ANOVA showed that R responses overall were reliably \nfaster than K responses, F (1,53) = 38.40, MSE = 84029.07. In addition, RTs \nin the two-step condition were reliably faster than RTs in the one-step \ncondition, F (1,53) = 15.95, MSE = 169921.19. Group also interacted with \nResponse Type, F (1,53) = 7.76, MSE = 84025.25. Analysis of simple main \neffects showed that the increase in RTs with the one-step procedure was \npresent in K responses, F (1,106) = 23.71, MSE = 126975.13, but not in R \nresponses, F (1,106) = 2.77, MSE = 126975.13, p = .10.  \n The numbers of correct R and K responses were entered into a 2x2x2 \n(Group x Frequency x Response Type) ANOVA. The main effect of Group \nwas not significant, F < 1. The main effect of Response Type was significant, \nwith participants making more R than K responses overall, F (1,54) = 5.91, \nMSE = 42.11. A significant main effect of Frequency was also observed, \nwhereby overall recognition was greater for low-frequency words than for \nhigh-frequency words, F (1,54) = 9.79, MSE = 2.64. These effects were \nqualified by a significant interaction between Frequency and Response Type, \nF (1,54) = 20.98, MSE = 10.87. Analysis of simple main effects showed a \nsignificant advantage for low-frequency words in R responses, F (1,108) = \n30.15, MSE = 6.75, and a significant advantage for high-frequency words in K \nresponses, F (1,108) = 7.44, MSE = 6.75. A similar analysis of false alarms \nshowed that they were greater for high-frequency than for low-frequency \nwords, F (1,54) = 26.98, MSE = 1.53, and were more likely to be categorized \nas K than as R responses, F (1,54) = 42.87, MSE = 4.68. None of the \ninteractions reached statistical significance.  \n The findings from Experiment 1 are consistent with previous findings \nreported by Dewhurst and Conway (1994) and Dewhurst et al. (1998). Positive \n14 \nrecognition decisions were reliably faster when items were categorized as R \nresponses rather than K responses. These findings are inconsistent with the \nview that familiarity is a rapid and automatic process and recollection is \nslower and more effortful. Instead, the findings suggest that old decisions \nbased on recollection can occur rapidly and automatically, while decisions \nbased on familiarity require additional processes, possibly in order to \ndetermine their familiarity relative to other items in the test. The results of the \none-step condition indicate that these findings are not an artefact of the two-\nstep remember-know procedure. Even without a preceding old\/new decision, \nR responses were executed reliably faster than K responses. These findings are \nagain consistent with the view the R responses can be made rapidly and \nautomatically in an all-or-none manner. The finding that RTs are slower in the \none-step procedure relative to the two-step procedure is consistent with the \nsuggestion of Hicks and Marsh (1999) that the one-step procedure is the more \ndifficult of the two, as it requires a decision between three alternatives (R, K, \nand new) rather than successive binary decisions. The finding that this effect \nwas reliably present only in K responses provides further support for the all-\nor-none nature of recollective experience. \n Analysis of the numbers of hits showed a WFE in R responses, with \nparticipants making more R responses to low-frequency than to high-\nfrequency words. This is consistent with findings reported previously by \nGardiner and Java (1990) and by Dewhurst et al. (1998). A mirror effect was \nalso observed, in that the effect of frequency in false alarms was in the \nopposite direction to the effect observed in hits. This is also consistent with \nprevious findings (e.g., Glanzer & Adams, 1985, 1990).  \nExperiment 2 \n15 \n The aim of Experiment 2 was to test the view that the difference in \nRTs between R and K responses reflects demand characteristics, whereby \nparticipants delay making a K response until both processes are completed \n(Yonelinas, 2002). This was investigated by presenting test items twice and \ndecoupling the R\/K decision from the old\/new decision. On the first \npresentation, participants made old\/new decisions for the full set of test items. \nThe items were then presented again and participants were asked to indicate \nwhether their previous old\/new decisions had been based on recollection or on \nfamiliarity. Any differences in RTs to old\/new decisions between items \nsubsequently categorized as R or as K responses should reflect genuine \ndifferences in the speed of the decision, rather than a strategy that prioritizes R \nresponses.  \nMethod \n The Method was the same as the two-step condition of Experiment 1 \nwith the following modifications: A new group of 50 undergraduates took \npart, none of whom had taken part in the previous experiments. The \nrecognition test was divided into two stages. In the first stage, participants \nwere asked to press the 1 key if they recognized a word from the study list and \nthe 2 key if they did not. Speed and accuracy of response were again \nemphasized. In the second stage, the recognition list was presented again, in a \ndifferent random order, and participants were asked to recall the basis on \nwhich they had made each positive decision in the first stage. They were asked \nto press R if their previous recognition decision had been based on \nrecollection, K if it had been based on familiarity, G if they had made a guess, \nor 2 if they had not recognized the word. Participants were not reminded of the \n16 \nresponses they made at the first stage as it was feared this would artificially \ninflate the numbers of K responses.  \nResults and Discussion \n Following the procedure described for Experiment 1, 37 outliers were \nremoved (23 R, 10 K, and 4 G), representing less than 5% of the total number \nof responses. Table 2 shows mean RTs and mean proportions of correct and \nfalse R, K, and G responses. Preliminary analysis of RTs on the 33 \nparticipants who made responses in each cell showed neither a significant \neffect of Frequency nor a significant interaction between Frequency and \nResponse Type, F < 1 in both cases. Mean RTs for R responses were 794 for \nhigh-frequency and 775 for low-frequency, while mean RTs for K responses \nwere 839 for high-frequency and 868 for low-frequency. The RT data were \ntherefore collapsed across Frequency and the analysis was expanded to the 45 \nparticipants who made at least one correct R and one correct K response. The \nresulting data were analyzed in a related t-test which showed that RTs to the \ninitial old\/new decisions were reliably faster for items that were later \ncategorized as R responses rather than K responses, t ( 44) = 2.13.  \nPlease insert Table 2 about here \n In the analysis of hits, the main effect of Response Type was \nsignificant, F (1,49) = 47.07, MSE = 30.63, with participants making reliably \nmore R than K responses. A significant main effect of Frequency was also \nobserved, F (1,49) = 29.42, MSE = 3.01. Consistent with previous findings, \nparticipants correctly recognized more low-frequency than high-frequency \nwords. This was qualified by a significant Frequency by Response Type \ninteraction, F (1,49) = 23.33, MSE = 6.87. Analysis of simple main effects \nshowed that the effect of Frequency was reliably present in R responses, F \n17 \n(1,49) = 80.95, MSE = 3.01, but not in K responses, F (1,49) = 1.76, MSE = \n3.01. False alarms were greater for high-frequency than for low-frequency \nwords, F (1,49) = 5.65, MSE = 1.21. Neither the effect of Response Type nor \nthe interaction between Frequency and Response Type were significant in the \nfalse alarms, F < 1 in both cases).  \n The results of Experiment 2 provide strong evidence against a demand \ncharacteristics explanation of the faster RTs for R responses (Yonelinas, \n2002). Recognition decisions that were subsequently categorized as R \nresponses were made more rapidly than decisions subsequently categorized as \nK responses, even though the R\/K decision was decoupled from the old\/new \ndecision. Participants were not informed of the distinction between R and K \nresponses when making their old\/new decisions and therefore would not have \nadopted a strategy of waiting until both processes were complete before \nmaking their response.  \nExperiment 3 \n Experiments 1 and 2 found no effects of word frequency in RTs. This \nis consistent with the null effects of frequency and age-of-acquisition in RTs \nreported by Dewhurst et al. (1998) and the null effects of pictures-versus-\nwords and imagery reported by Dewhurst and Conway (1994). Nevertheless, \nin each of these studies RTs to R responses were reliably faster than RTs to K \nresponses. This suggests that any test item that cues episodic details will \nproduce a rapid R response. The stimuli in Experiments 1 and 2 were \nexclusively words, and it is likely that words presented at study give rise to \nrich, episodic traces by activating long-term knowledge, regardless of their \nfrequency. This knowledge is cued when the words are presented again at test \nand allows the participant to make rapid and confident R responses. \n18 \nExperiment 3 therefore featured a words-versus-nonwords manipulation. \nNonwords are unlikely to activate stored knowledge and will therefore be \nencoded less distinctively than words. The encoding of nonwords is more \nlikely to feature phonological or orthographic details, which may be less \ndiagnostic of a prior presentation and may result in slower RTs at test. \nExperiment 3 investigated this possibility.  \nMethod \n The Method was the same as the two-step condition of Experiment 1 \nwith the following modifications: Participants were a new group of 40 \nstudents from Lancaster University. Stimuli consisted of 60 words and 60 \nnonwords, divided into two study lists of 30 words and 30 nonwords each. The \nwords were selected from the Toronto Word Pool, Friendly, Franklin, \nHoffman, & Rubin, 1982) and were of moderate to high frequency. Nonwords \nwere selected from the ARC Nonword Database (Rastle, Harrington, & \nColtheart, 2002) and were all pronounceable.  \nResults and Discussion \n Following the procedure used in Experiments 1 and 2, 49 outliers (29 \nR, 16 K, and 4 G) were removed, again representing less than 5% of the total \nnumber of responses. Contrary to the effects of word frequency in \nExperiments 1 and 2, preliminary analyses indicated that RTs were influenced \nby the words-versus-nonwords manipulation. The main analysis of RTs was \ntherefore conducted on the 34 participants who made responses in each of the \nfour cells created by crossing Words-versus-nonwords and Response Type. \nConsistent with Experiments 1 and 2, a significant main effect of Response \nType was observed, F (1,33) = 110.83, MSE = 96051.43, whereby RTs to R \nresponses were faster than RTs to K responses. A significant main effect of \n19 \nWords-versus-nonwords was also observed, F (1,33) = 6.20, MSE = \n148239.54, whereby RTs to words were faster than RTs to nonwords. This \nwas qualified by a significant interaction between Response Type and Words-\nversus-nonwords, F (1,33) = 9.65, MSE = 105418.89. Analysis of simple main \neffects showed that R responses to words were reliably faster than R responses \nto nonwords, F (1,33) = 13.05, MSE = 148239.54, whereas K responses to \nwords and nonwords did not differ reliably, F < 1. R responses were faster \nthan K responses for both words and nonwords, F = 94.98 and 26.44 \nrespectively, MSE = 96051.43. Table 3 shows the mean hit and false alarm \nrates collected from all 40 participants, plus the mean RTs from the subset of \n34 participants described above.  \nPlease insert Table 3 about here \n A 2x2 ANOVA on the numbers of correct R and K responses showed \nthat participants recognized more words than nonwords, F (1,39) = 7.46, MSE \n= 12.26, and made more R than K responses, F (1,39) = 17.86, MSE = 73.74. \nThe interaction was also significant, F (1,39) = 26.68, MSE = 18.24. Analysis \nof simple main effects showed that more R responses were made to words \nthan to nonwords, F (1,39) = 40.77, MSE = 12.26, while more K responses \nwere made to nonwords than to words, F (1,39) = 6.36, MSE = 12.26. A \nsimilar analysis on the false alarms showed that these were more likely to be \ncategorized as K than R responses, F (1,39) = 15.34, MSE = 7.87. The effect \nof Words-versus-nonwords and the interaction were not significant for the \nfalse alarms, F < 1 in both cases.  \n The main finding from Experiment 3 was that the manipulation of \nwords-versus-nonwords significantly influenced RTs. This is in contrast to the \nfindings of Experiments 1 and 2 and previous research (Dewhurst & Conway, \n20 \n1994; Dewhurst et al., 1998) that stimulus characteristics do not influence \nRTs, despite having significant effects on hit rates. However, despite the \ndifference between words and nonwords, R responses were faster than K \nresponses for both types of stimuli. The finding that words were associated \nwith more R responses and fewer K responses than nonwords is consistent \nwith the findings of Gardiner and Java (1990). \nGeneral Discussion \n The results of three experiments confirm previous findings that R \nresponses are made more rapidly than K responses (Dewhurst & Conway, \n1994; Dewhurst et al., 1998; Henson et al., 1999). These findings are \ninconsistent with the view that recollection is a slower and more effortful \nprocess than familiarity. According to dual-process models, recollection is a \nresource-demanding task that is mediated by consciousness (Jacoby & Dallas, \n1981) and requires the same effortful processes as those used in tests of recall \n(Mandler, 1980). The present findings show that recognition decisions based \non recollection, at least as measured by R responses, can be made rapidly and \naccurately. In contrast, K responses require additional post-retrieval processes, \npossibly in order to determine their familiarity relative to other items in the \ntest.  \n The present findings are also inconsistent with the suggestion by \nYonelinas (2002) that the faster RTs for R responses are an artefact of \ninstructions that require participants to make a K response only when an item \nis not recollected. He suggested that such instructions encourage participants \nto wait until both the recollection and the familiarity processes are completed \nbefore making a response. The results of Experiment 2, in particular, do not \nsupport this account. Participants in Experiment 2 made old\/new decisions \n21 \nmore rapidly to items that were subsequently categorized as R responses, even \nwhen the R\/K decision was decoupled from the old\/new decision. Under such \nconditions, participants would not be aware that their recognition decisions \ncould be based on two different processes. These findings therefore provide \nstrong evidence against a demand characteristics account.  \n The finding that R responses are made more rapidly than K responses \nappears to be incompatible with previous findings that recognition decisions \nare faster when based on familiarity. For example, Boldini et al. (2004) found \nthat effects of modality manipulations (presumed to influence familiarity) \nwere observed with an early response deadline whereas a levels-of-processing \nmanipulation (presumed to influence recollection) affected recognition only \nwith a late response deadline. Similarly, Hintzman and Caulton (1997) found \nthat old\/new decisions were made more rapidly than decisions that required \nrecollection of the learning episode. It is difficult to compare the findings of \nthe present study with findings from response deadline studies as forcing \nparticipants to make speeded responses may alter the nature of the recognition \ndecision. However, it is notable that Gardiner et al. found levels-of-processing \neffects in R responses with both early and late response deadlines, suggesting \nthat R responses can be made rapidly and automatically (see also \nKonstantinou & Gardiner, in press).  \n The inconsistencies between the above findings and those of the \npresent study can be resolved by assuming that RTs to R and K responses do \nnot reflect the time-course of the recollection and familiarity processes per se, \nbut rather the time taken to make old\/new decisions on the basis of the \ninformation provided by these processes, at least under non-speeded response \nconditions. Henson et al. (1999) suggested that the slower RTs for K \n22 \nresponses reflect the time taken to make old\/new decisions in the absence of \ncontextual information. Similarly, Dewhurst and Conway (1994) argued that \nrecognition decisions that do not feature recollective experience require \nadditional processing in order to evaluate the familiarity of an item relative to \nother items in the test list. The present findings support these accounts. In \ncontrast, when a test item cues contextual details, such as thoughts, images, \nand associations made at encoding, old\/new decisions can be made rapidly. \nThe faster RTs for R responses therefore reflect the greater ease of making \nsuch decisions when supported by the recollection of contextual information. \nWe would also argue that it is the cueing of this information at test that gives \nrise to the subjective experience of remembering by mentally reinstating \naspects of the encoding context. Rather than being the product of a slow and \neffortful retrieval process, the present findings indicate that such processes can \noccur rapidly and automatically.  \n The cueing of contextual information at test may also account for the \nfaster RTs for R responses to words relative to nonwords observed in \nExperiment 3. This finding is consistent with the view that the encoding of \nwords is likely to feature information activated from long-term memory, such \nas images, associations, and autobiographical references. These details are \ncued when the words are presented again at test and support rapid and \nconfident experiences of remembering. In contrast, the encoding of nonwords \nis more likely to feature phonological and orthographic information, which \nmay be less diagnostic of a prior presentation, resulting in slower recognition \ndecisions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an independent \nvariable influencing the speed of R responses.  \n23 \n Some researchers have interpreted R and K responses in terms of \nsignal detection theory (e.g., Donaldson, 1996; Dunn, 2004; Hirshman & \nMaster, 1997). According to unidimensional signal detection models, \nrecognition decisions are based on an underlying dimension of trace strength \nor familiarity. Participants make R\/K decisions by setting an old\/new criterion \nand a higher remember\/know criterion for items judged to be old. Items that \nexceed the second criterion are judged as R responses, while items falling \nbetween the two criteria as judged as K responses. The present findings are \nnot inconsistent with trace strength models, as one would expect highly \nfamiliar items to be recognized more rapidly than less familiar items. Indeed, \nWixted and Stretch (2004) have recently shown that a unidimensional signal \ndetection model predicts faster RTs for R than for K responses in both hits and \nfalse alarms. They also argue that such findings cannot be explained by dual-\nprocess remember-know models. However, this argument is based on the \nassumption that R and K responses map directly onto the recollection and \nfamiliarity processes. As suggested above, it is more likely that R and K \nresponses reflect differences in the time taken to make a recognition decision \nbased on the information provided by these processes, rather than the speed of \nthe processes themselves.  \nAlthough the present findings can be explained by unidimensional \nsignal detection models, there is converging evidence from both behavioral \nand brain imaging studies that R and K responses differ in more than just \nfamiliarity or confidence (see Gardiner & Richardson-Klavehn, 2000, for a \nreview). While it is possible that a continuum of trace strength or confidence \nunderlies recognition decisions, we have argued that other types of \ninformation are cued by test items, such as images, associations, and \n24 \nautobiographical references (see also Dewhurst & Conway, 1994; Johnson, \nHashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993; Reder et al., 2000). It is this additional \ninformation that distinguishes R from K responses. The multiattribute nature \nof R responses is more accurately reflected in multidimensional signal \ndetection models (e.g., Banks, 2000; Rotello, Macmillan, & Reeder, 2004). \nSuch models represent a number of dimensions in a single spatial \nrepresentation, which can then be projected onto unidimensional decision \naxes. However, like unidimensional models, multidimensional signal detection \nmodels are concerned with modelling the decision process itself rather than \nthe subjective experience that accompanies it. Whilst they place constraints on \nthe nature and operation of the psychological processes in a model, they are \nnot a substitute for psychological explanations of recognition memory. They \nshould therefore be seen as complementary to first person accounts, such as \nthe remember-know procedure, rather than rival theories.  \n Finally, although not the main focus of the present study, Experiments \n1 and 2 confirmed previous findings of a word frequency mirror effect, \nwhereby low-frequency words were associated with more hits and fewer false \nalarms than high-frequency words (e.g., Glanzer & Adams, 1985, 1990). That \nthis pattern was observed in three variations of the remember-know procedure \ndemonstrates the robust nature of the mirror effect. However, there was no \nevidence of a words-versus-nonwords mirror effect in Experiment 3. Although \nwords were associated with more hits than nonwords, false alarms did not \ndiffer reliably between the two sets of stimuli. This is consistent with the view \nthat the higher false alarm rate usually found for high-frequency words reflects \ntheir greater pre-experimental familiarity relative to low-frequency words \n(e.g., Reder et al., 2000). As nonwords have no pre-existing representations, \n25 \nthey cannot be falsely recognized on the basis of pre-experimental familiarity. \nIt is also notable that the recognition advantage for low-frequency words was \nalways observed in R responses. This is consistent with findings from \nprevious research (e.g., Dewhurst et al., 1998; Gardiner & Java, 1990) and \nindicates that the presence of the WFE in R responses is not an artefact of the \ntwo-step procedure. The presence of the WFE in R responses despite the \nprocedural variations also indicates that participants were using R and K \nresponses appropriately in the different test conditions. \n To summarize, the main finding from the present study is that R \nresponses are made more rapidly than K responses, regardless of the type of \nremember-know procedure used (one-step or two-step) and of the location of \nthe R\/K decision within the procedure (immediate or delayed). These findings \nindicate that subjective experiences of remembering and knowing do not map \ndirectly onto the recollection and familiarity processes, at least as \nconceptualized in dual-process models of recognition memory. Instead, \nexperiences of remembering occur rapidly and automatically, while \nexperiences of knowing may involve evaluative decisions that require \nconscious control. The present findings are consistent with the view that items \npresented in a test of recognition memory cue different types of information, \nincluding subjective feelings of familiarity and details of the encoding context. \nIt is the type of information available at test (familiarity versus contextual \ndetails) that determines the speed with which items can be identified as old. \n26 \nAcknowledgement. \nThis research was supported by Grant R000237594 awarded by the Economic \nand Social Research Council and by Grant F\/00185\/G awarded by the \nLeverhulme Trust.   \n27 \nReferences \n Aggleton, J.P., & Brown, W.M.
