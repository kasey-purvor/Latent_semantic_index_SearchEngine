BRIDGES\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK\n(Received 24 October 2003 and in revised form 2 February 2004)\nThe superharmonic instability is pervasive in large-amplitude water-wave problems\nand numerical simulations have predicted a close connection between it and crest\ninstabilities and wave breaking. In this paper we present a nonlinear theory, which\nis a generic nonlinear consequence of superharmonic instability. The theory predicts\nthe nonlinear behaviour witnessed in numerics, and gives new information about the\nnonlinear structure of large-amplitude water waves, including a mechanism for noisy\nwave breaking.\n1. Superharmonic instability of water waves\nThe superharmonic (SH) instability of travelling surface waves is one of the two\nprincipal instabilities of nonlinear periodic travelling waves of \ufb01nite amplitude, the\nother being the Benjamin\u2013Feir or modulational instability. The SH instability arises\nwhen the momentum of the wave, considered as a function of the wave speed,\npasses through a critical point. Figure 1 shows a typical momentum\u2013wave speed (I\u2013c)\ndiagram where the \ufb01rst critical point is a maximum.\nThe SH instability di\ufb00ers from the Benjamin\u2013Feir instablility in that the SH\nperturbation has the same wavelength as the basic periodic travelling wave. The\nSH instability is pervasive in water-wave problems (e.g. Longuet-Higgins 1978;\nSa\ufb00man 1985; Tanaka 1985; Tanaka et al. 1987; Jillians 1989; Longuet-Higgins &\nDommermuth 1997), in interfacial wave problems (Holyer 1979), and the Kelvin\u2013\nHelmholtz instability (Drazin 1970; Benjamin & Bridges 1997, \u00a7 2.4).\nLinear SH instability of water waves was \ufb01rst found by Longuet-Higgins (1978)\nby computing the eigenvalues of the linearization about periodic travelling waves.\nSubsequently Tanaka (1985) discovered, in further numerical calculations, that\nthe linear SH instability of water waves is associated with a maximum of the\nmomentum (equivalently, the energy) when considered as a function of the wave\nspeed. In a seminal paper, the structure of the linear problem near an SH instability\nwas illuminated by Sa\ufb00man (1985). He showed analytically that a momentum\n(equivalently, energy) maximum corresponds precisely to a change in SH instability.\nUsing Sa\ufb00man\u2019s Theorem, one can predict a point of SH instability transition\n(generically) by studying the critical points of the I\u2013c diagram.\nOne of the most interesting consequences of the SH instability is that numerical\nsimulations show that SH instability is closely associated with a form of wave breaking\n(Tanaka et al. 1987; Jillians 1989; Longuet-Higgins & Dommermuth 1997).\nExisting theory for SH instability is however restricted to linearized instability. The\nonly nonlinear results in the literature are obtained by numerical simulation.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n154 T. J. Bridges\ncccritc0\nI\nFigure 1. A schematic of the momentum\u2013wave speed (I\u2013c) plane for water waves.\nA superharmonic instability transition arises at the maximum.\nIn this paper a theory for the nonlinear behaviour near the SH instability transition\nis presented. The theory is based on an application of dynamical systems theory. The\nmain result is that the nonlinear problem near the SH instability always (generically)\nleads to a homoclinic torus bifurcation . This homoclinic bifurcation explains the results\nseen in numerical simulations near the SH instability (Tanaka et al. 1987; Longuet-\nHiggins & Dommermuth 1997).\nThe ocean environment will have naturally occurring forcing and dissipation. And,\nit is well known that homoclinic orbits with small damping and forcing can generate\ncomplex dynamics. So, with a perturbation (for example, a periodic pressure variation\nover the ocean), and small damping, the homoclinic torus bifurcation can give rise\nto complex dynamics which will in\ufb02uence wave breaking, creating a form of wave\nbreaking perturbed by weak chaos, which we will call noisy wave breaking.\nSo far, this discussion has been limited to the behaviour near the \ufb01rst maximum\nof the momentum as in \ufb01gure 1. However, there are further results in the literature\nabout the I\u2013c diagram that suggest a far more dramatic sequence of homoclinic\nbifurcations. The \ufb01rst maximum in the I\u2013c diagram as shown in \ufb01gure 1 was found\nby Longuet-Higgins (1975). Subsequent analysis using matched asymptotic expansions\nby Longuet-Higgins & Fox (1978) showed that in the limit as the highest wave is\napproached the number of critical points of the I\u2013c diagram approaches in\ufb01nity.\nNumerical results of Chandler & Graham (1993) also provide evidence that the\nnumber of critical points of the I\u2013c diagram is increasing without bound. In other\nwords, the continuation of the diagram in \ufb01gure 1 is a spiral with a \ufb01nite limit\n(I\u221e, c\u221e), and the asymptotics of Longuet-Higgins & Fox (1978) predict that the spiral\nis logarithmic.\nThese results are based on the properties of the Stokes wave. At each critical\npoint of the I\u2013c curve, Sa\ufb00man\u2019s Theorem can be applied to conclude that a\npair of eigenvalues, in the linearization about the Stokes wave, is coalescing at\nthe origin. Indeed, Longuet-Higgins & Tanaka (1997) have computed eigenvalues of\nthe linearization about Stokes waves near the \ufb01rst two critical points (a maximum\nand minimum) and show explicitly that unstable eigenvalues are generated at both.\nThe nonlinear theory of this paper extends Sa\ufb00man\u2019s theory into the nonlinear\nregime. Therefore, one can deduce that near each critical point of the I\u2013c curve, there\nwill be an attendant homoclinic torus bifurcation, and if this sequence is in\ufb01nite the\nphysical and mathematical consequences are manifold.\nThe existence of a homoclinic torus bifurcation for water waves near an SH\ninstability follows from four observations. (a) Numerical results as noted above show\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSuperharmonic instability and homoclinic bifurcation 155\nthat the I\u2013c diagram for periodic Stokes waves has at least one critical point and\npossibly an in\ufb01nite number. (b) Sa\ufb00man\u2019s theorem shows that critical points in the\nI\u2013c plane imply a coalescence of two eigenvalues at zero. (c) Hamiltonian theory\n(using the fact that the water-wave problem is Hamiltonian) shows that locally in\nthe nonlinear problem near this coalescence, there is a homoclinic bifurcation (cf.\nArnold, Kozlov & Neishtadt 1993, pp. 264 and 270). (d) Travelling waves are not\nequilibria but relative equilibria and so there is an attendant circle symmetry. Using\nthis symmetry it follows that there is a toral surface of homoclinic bifurcations.\nThis combination of theory is formal, but can be made precise using Birkho\ufb00 normal\nform theory for water waves (see Craig 1996 for an exposition on normal form theory\nfor water waves). However, the important feature of the above observations is that\nthe nonlinear consequences of SH instability can be predicted a priori, before explicit\ncomputation or numerical simulation.\nNormal form theory shows that there is a four-dimensional subspace of the in\ufb01nite-\ndimensional water-wave problem in which the principal dynamics occurs. Therefore, a\nsimpli\ufb01ed model problem \u2013 which has all the features of the reduced four-dimensional\nsubspace associated with the water-wave problem near an SH instability \u2013 will be\nused to introduce the main features of the connection between SH instability and\nhomoclinic torus bifurcation. Then the implications for water waves are discussed.\n2. A model for nonlinear SH instability\nA simpli\ufb01ed model, which has all the essential geometric features of a Stokes wave\nnear an energy-momentum maximum and a change of SH instability, is\nAtt \u2212 2ia At \u2212 r A \u2212 |A|2A = 0 , A(t) \u2208 \u0001 , (2.1)\nwith a, r \u2208 \u0002 with a > 0 and 0 < r < a2. Although this model is not derived explicitly\nfrom water waves, it is in fact the model obtained when the SH instability arises at\nlow amplitude, as in the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz problem (cf. Drazin 1970; Benjamin &\nBridges 1997, \u00a7 2.4). Indeed, one of the consequences of the observations in this paper\nis that a homoclinic torus bifurcation is also a central feature of the formation of\nnonlinear Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz billows (the full implications of this observation will be\nconsidered elsewhere).\nThe energy H and momentum I for (2.1) are\nH = |At |2 \u2212 r |A|2 \u2212 12 |A|4, I = a|A|2 \u2212 Im(AAt ) . (2.2)\nThey satisfy It = Ht = 0 for all time and model the energy and momentum of water\nwaves. The periodic Stokes wave in the model (2.1) is represented by A(t) = A0e\nict .\nSubstitution of this form into (2.1) results in the nonlinear dispersion relation\n(c \u2212 a)2 + |A0|2 = a2 \u2212 r , (2.3)\nand the momentum along this branch is I = (a \u2212 c)|A0|2. Let c0 = a \u2212\n\u221a\na2 \u2212 r . Then\nfor c0 < c < a the wave speed c is a positive increasing function of amplitude. The\nslope of the momentum is positive for c0 < c < ccrit where\nccrit = a \u2212\n\u221a\n1\n3\n(a2 \u2212 r) < a . (2.4)\nAt ccrit there is a change in slope. Before considering the linear and nonlinear\nbehaviour near ccrit, it will be of value to view this problem from a Hamiltonian\nperspective.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n156 T. J. Bridges\n2.1. Hamiltonian structure of the SH instability\nAs in the linear theory of Sa\ufb00man for the SH instability, the Hamiltonian structure\nturns out to be fundamental in the analysis of the nonlinear SH problem as well. In\nthis subsection, a Hamiltonian analysis of the SH instability of the model problem\n(2.1) is presented.\nLet (q, p) \u2208 \u00024 be real coordinates de\ufb01ned by q1+iq2 = A and p1+ip2 = At \u2212 iaA;\nthen the model equation (2.1) can be written in the standard Hamiltonian form\nJUt = \u2207H (U ) , U = (q, p) \u2208 \u00024 , J =\n[\n0 \u2212I\nI 0\n]\n, (2.5)\nwhere I is the identity on \u00022, and\nH (U ) = 1\n2\n(\np21 + p\n2\n2\n) \u2212 a(p1q2 \u2212 p2q1) \u2212 12 (r \u2212 a2)(q21 + q22) \u2212 14(q21 + q22)2 , (2.6)\nand the momentum in these coordinates is I = p1q2 \u2212 p2q1.\nThe system (2.5) is invariant with respect to the group SO(2) with action G\u03b8 =\n(R\u03b8q,R\u03b8p) where R\u03b8 is the standard action of SO(2) on \u00022. This SO(2) symmetry\nin the model problem is analogous to the translation invariance of the water-wave\nproblem restricted to periodic functions. The details of how SO(2) symmetry arises in\nthe spatially periodic water-wave problem are given in \u00a7 2.2 of Benjamin & Bridges\n(1997).\nThe basic state (representing the Stokes wave) can be characterized as a relative\nequilibrium associated with the group SO(2)\nU (t) = G\u03b8(t)U0, \u03b8(t) = ct + \u03b80, (2.7)\nwith U0 \u2208 \u00024 satisfying \u2207H (U0) + c\u2207I (U0) = 0. Explicit calculations show that\nU0 = (q0, cJ2q0) with |q0|2 = a2 \u2212 r \u2212 (c \u2212 a)2, J2 =\n[\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n]\n.\nThis result is a symplectic formulation of the basic state A(t) = A0e\nict of (2.1).\nFormulating the basic state as in (2.7) so that U0 is a critical point of the energy\nrestricted to level sets of the momentum is analogous to the construction of travelling\nwaves of the water-wave problem as relative equilibria (cf. Benjamin & Bridges 1997,\n\u00a7 2).\nSubstituting the solution (2.7) into the energy and momentum we \ufb01nd\nH0(c) =\n1\n4\n|q0|2(3c2 \u2212 2ac \u2212 r), I0(c) = (a \u2212 c)|q0|2 ,\nwith derivatives I \u20320(c) = \u2212(a2 \u2212 r) + 3(c \u2212 a)2 = \u2212 1cH \u20320(c). Note that when c \u0006= 0,\nthe derivative I \u20320(c) = 0 if and only if H \u20320(c) = 0. This result is a general property\nof periodic travelling waves characterized by a constrained variational principle (cf.\nBenjamin & Bridges 1997, \u00a7 3).\nThe association between the energy\u2013momentum maximum and the SH instability\nis elementary to establish for this model. Linearize (2.5) about (2.7) and look for\nsolutions proportional to e\u03bbt . Then the characteristic equation is\ndet[D2H (U0) \u2212 cD2I (U0) \u2212 \u03bbJ] = \u03bb4 + 2I \u20320(c) \u03bb2 = 0.\nFigure 2 shows the behaviour of the eigenvalues of the linear stability problem as\nI0(c) passes through a maximum.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSuperharmonic instability and homoclinic bifurcation 157\nI'(c) = 0 I'(c) > 0 I'(c) < 0 \nFigure 2. A schematic of the eigenvalue movement of the linearization of (2.5) about the\nbasic state (2.7), when I \u2032(c) changes sign.\n3. Homoclinic torus bifurcation\nUsing the model system, it will be shown explicitly that SH instability always leads\nto a homoclinic torus bifurcation. Then it is shown that this nonlinear bifurcation\nis a generic property of any Hamiltonian system with a state that has an energy\u2013\nmomentum maximum of the form shown in \ufb01gure 1.\nIntroduce the following change of coordinates, (q1, q2, p1, p2) \u2192 (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03b8, I ):\nq1 = \u03be cos \u03b8, q2 = \u03be sin \u03b8,\np1 = \u03b7 cos \u03b8 + I sin \u03b8 \/\u03be, p2 = \u03b7 sin \u03b8 \u2212 I cos \u03b8 \/\u03be.\n}\n(3.1)\nIn these coordinates the symplectic structure remains the same, and the governing\nequations are mapped to\n\u03be\u02d9 = \u03b7, (3.2a)\n\u03b7\u02d9 = (r \u2212 a2)\u03be + \u03be 3 + I 2\/\u03be 3, (3.2b)\n\u03b8\u02d9 = \u2212I\/\u03be 2 + a, (3.2c)\nI\u02d9 = 0. (3.2d)\nThe system (3.2) provides natural coordinates to split the phase space and study the\ndynamics near the basic state (2.7). Equations (3.2c, d) here give the dynamics tangent\nto the basic state, and (3.2a, b) give the dynamics normal to the basic state.\nNow, let (\u03be0, \u03b70, \u03b80, I0) be a basic state of the form (2.7) in the coordinates (3.1):\n\u03b80 = ct , \u03b70 = 0 , \u03be\n2\n0 = a\n2 \u2212 r \u2212 (c \u2212 a)2 ,\nand I = I0(c), and introduce perturbed coordinates: \u03be = \u03be0 + u, \u03b7 = \u03b70 + v, and\n\u03b8 = ct +\u03c6 with I \u2212 I0 small. Then, expanding the nonlinear di\ufb00erential equation (3.2)\nin a Taylor series about the basic state leads to the system\nu\u02d9 = v, (3.3a)\nv\u02d9 = \u22122I \u20320(c) u + 2I0\u03be 30 (I \u2212 I0) + b(c) u\n2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.3b)\n\u03c6\u02d9 = \u2212 1\n\u03be 20\n(I \u2212 I0) + 2I0\n\u03be 30\nu + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.3c)\nI\u02d9 = 0, (3.3d)\nwhere b(c) = (3\/\u03be0)(a\n2\u2212r+(c\u2212a)2) > 0. Now this system is valid in the neighbourhood\nof any value of momentum level set I0 along the (I, c) curve in \ufb01gure 1. However,\nI \u20320(c) = 0 (or I \u20320(c) \u2248 0) at (or very near) the maximum of the curve in which case the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n158 T.

(3.4b)\nThis reduced system has two \ufb01xed points (which represent periodic solutions in the\noriginal problem), one of which is elliptic and the other hyperbolic, for Icrit(I\u2212Icrit) < 0.\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic point coincide resulting in a\nhomoclinic connection. This is shown schematically in the upper part of \ufb01gure 3. It\nis a homoclinic torus, because the trajectory winds around the torus with (3.3c) as\nshown schematically in \ufb01gure 4.\n3.1. Homoclinic torus bifurcation of water waves\nAlthough the above theory has been presented for the model problem, the theory\ncarries over to water waves. Water waves can be modelled as an in\ufb01nite-dimensional\nHamiltonian system using the Zakharov (1968) formulation with canonical variables\n(\u03b7,\u03a6) where \u03b7(x, t) is the free-surface elevation and \u03a6(x, t) is the velocity potential\nevaluated at the free surface, and\n\u03b7t =\n\u03b4H\n\u03b4\u03a6\n, \u03a6t = \u2212\u03b4H\n\u03b4\u03b7\n. (3.5)\nLet \u03b7(x, t) = \u03b7\u0302(x\u2212ct)+\u03b7\u02dc(x, t) and \u03a6(x, t) = \u03a6\u0302(x\u2212ct)+\u03a6\u02dc(x, t) where (\u03b7\u0302, \u03a6\u0302) represents\nthe Stokes wave. The perturbed variables (\u03b7\u02dc, \u03a6\u02dc) will be governed by a Hamiltonian\nsystem. By choosing new coordinates and performing normal form transformations\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSuperharmonic instability and homoclinic bifurcation 159\nthe perturbed water-wave problem can be transformed to\n\u03be\u02d9 = a1\u03b7 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.6a)\n\u03b7\u02d9 = \u2212a2I \u20320(c)(\u03be \u2212 \u03be0) + a3 (I \u2212 I0) + b(c) (\u03be \u2212 \u03be0)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.6b)\n\u03b8\u02d9 = a4 (I \u2212 I0) + a5(\u03be \u2212 \u03be0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.6c)\nI\u02d9 = 0, (3.6d)\nZ\u02d9 = f (Z, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03b8, I ), (3.6e)\nwhere Z represents the in\ufb01nite-dimensional set of complementary variables for water\nwaves. The coe\ufb03cient a1 can be scaled to be \u00b11. The other coe\ufb03cients a2, a3, b(c), a4\nand a5 are generically non-zero. They can be computed from information associated\nwith a given travelling wave and using Birkho\ufb00 normal form theory. However, more\nimportantly, the conclusion of homoclinic torus bifurcation occurs regardless of the\nspeci\ufb01c values of these coe\ufb03cients.\nBy formally truncating the above system, there is a four-dimensional subspace on\nwhich the dynamics is reduced to the local analysis of the model equation in (3.3),\nwith the attendant homoclinic torus bifurcation. Indeed, because of the additional\npurely imaginary eigenvalues, the dynamics will be in general more complex than just\na homoclinic bifurcation. See for example the work of Broer et al. (1993), where the\ncase of a homoclinic bifurcation with one extra pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues\nis studied and shown to have more complex dynamics than an isolated homoclinic\nbifurcation.\nThe fact that any system with an energy\u2013momentum maximum can be transformed\nto the form (3.6) is based on three observations. First, any symmetry-based solution\nwhich has a maximum of the energy\u2013momentum has a pair of eigenvalues (of\nthe linear stability problem) passing through zero \u2013 this is Sa\ufb00man\u2019s Theorem for\nSH instability. Secondly, any Hamiltonian system with a pair of eigenvalues passing\nthrough the origin always has a homoclinic bifurcation (see \u00a7 4 of Chapter 7 in Arnold\net al. 1993 and Broer et al. 1993) as long as the coe\ufb03cient of the \ufb01rst nonlinear term\n(i.e. the coe\ufb03cient b(c) in (3.3)) is non-zero. Thirdly, in the symmetric context (such\nas the model problem and the water-wave problem) the homoclinic orbit has an extra\ndimension, resulting in a homoclinic torus.\n4. Breaking of water waves\nWhile the model (2.1) shows the local nonlinear behaviour near a transition of\nSH instability, we need the full splendor of the water-wave equations to see the\nconsequences for wave breaking.\nThe main results in the literature we can appeal to for comparison are the numerical\nsimulations of the nonlinear problem by Longuet-Higgins & Dommermuth (1997)\nand Jillians (1989). Tanaka et al. (1987) also show numerical simulations near SH\ninstability but the basic state is a solitary wave there. All the numerical simulations\nshow that certain initial conditions lead to a form of wave breaking as shown\nschematically in \ufb01gure 5. The other possibility witnessed in numerics is an evolution to\na slower periodic wave (either in a recurrent or attractive way). Both of these numerical\nobservations are predicted by the homoclinic torus bifurcation. If perturbations are to\nthe left side of the hyperbolic point in the reduced two-dimensional phase space (i.e.\nto the left of the hyperbolic periodic point in the \u03be\u2013\u03b7 phase space in \ufb01gure 3) they\nwill circle around the slower periodic wave. However, the numerical solutions have a\nsmall amount of numerical dissipation (see discussion in Dold 1992). Therefore the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n160 T. J. Bridges\nFigure 5.

A schematic of the reduced phase space when weak damping is included.\nelliptic periodic orbit will develop an attracting direction, and so the behaviour in the\nnumerical solutions is probably closer to the (reduced) phase space schematic shown\nin \ufb01gure 6. Depending on the amount of damping, the initial conditions are either\nattracted to the slower periodic wave or they will circle it in a recurrent fashion,\nslowly settling on the slower periodic wave eventually. This behaviour is in agreement\nwith the numerical results.\nTo the right of the hyperbolic periodic point in the \u03be\u2013\u03b7 phase space in \ufb01gure 3 there\nare no other periodic solutions locally, and so trajectories escape. It is clear from the\nnumerical simulations that this direction leads to wave breaking. Since wave breaking\nis an unsteady solution, it suggests that there are indeed no other steady solutions\nnearby. The only known steady solution in this regime is the steady breaking of wave\nJenkins (1994). However, Jenkins\u2019 solution is multi-valued and so would not be seen\nby the numerics.\n4.1. A potentially in\ufb01nite sequence of homoclinic torus bifurcations\nThe theory that predicts a homoclinic torus bifurcation relies only on the existence of\na critical point of the momentum in the I\u2013c diagram. As noted in the introduction,\nnumerical results of Longuet-Higgins (1975); Chandler & Graham (1993) and the\nasymptotics of Longuet-Higgins & Fox (1978) for the I\u2013c diagram and the numerical\ncalculations of the linear stability problem of Longuet-Higgins & Tanaka (1997) all\nshow that there is more than one point of SH instability transition, and potentially\nan in\ufb01nite number.\nA schematic of the I\u2013c diagram for water waves based on these results is shown\nin \ufb01gure 7 with the sequential SH points marked. It is apparent from the theory in\nthis paper that each of the SH transition points will correspond generically to points\nof homoclinic torus bifurcation, and this is also shown schematically in \ufb01gure 7. One\ncan conjecture a far more dramatic sequence of bifurcations based on the theory\nof Longuet-Higgins & Fox (1978). Using matched asymptotic expansions, Longuet-\nHiggins & Fox (1978) show that as the highest wave is approached the I\u2013c curve\nspirals in\ufb01nitely often. For Stokes gravity waves in deep water, Longuet-Higgins &\nFox (1978) found the asymptotic form of the phase speed c and the momentum I to\nbe\nc2 = c2\u221e + A\u0007\n3 cos(3\u00b5 ln \u0007 + B), I = I\u221e + A\u2032\u00073 cos(3\u00b5 ln \u0007 + B \u2032), (4.1)\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nSuperharmonic instability and homoclinic bifurcation 161\nI\nc\nFigure 7. A schematic of the momentum\u2013wave speed (I\u2013c) plane showing a potential sequence\nof SH instability points and potential homoclinic bifurcations for periodic travelling water\nwaves.\nwhere c\u221e and I\u221e are the speed and momentum of the highest wave and expressions\nfor the order-one constants A, A\u2032, \u00b5, B and B \u2032 are given in the paper. Here, \u0007 is\na small parameter tending to zero as the limiting wave is approached. As \u0007 \u2192 0,\nln \u0007 \u2192 \u2212\u221e leading to an in\ufb01nite spiral in the I\u2013c plane.\nAt every critical point of the momentum as a function of the wave speed a pair\nof eigenvalues coalesces in the linear stability problem. By the theory in this paper\nthere is an attendant homoclinic torus bifurcation. Therefore we can reasonably\nconjecture that as the highest Stokes wave is approached, the phase space is being\n\ufb01lled out by homoclinic bifurcations. On the physical side, this is of interest as it\ngives a geometric structure of the phase space of the nonlinear problem near the\nhighest Stokes wave, and theoretically the sequence of homoclinic bifurcations is of\ninterest as a fundamental new bifurcation in symmetric Hamiltonian sytems in in\ufb01nite\ndimension \u2013 especially if the sequence of homoclinic bifurcations is in\ufb01nite.\n4.2. Noisy wave breaking\nIt is well known in dynamical systems theory that the addition of small damping\nand forcing to an ODE with a homoclinic orbit can lead to complex dynamics, i.e.\n\u2018horseshoe chaos\u2019 (Guckenheimer & Holmes 1990). The existence of horseshoe chaos\nin the model problem (2.5), perturbed by damping and forcing, could be proved\nusing analytical methods. However, an open question is the implications of this\nform of weak chaos on the form of the breaking waves induced by SH instability.\nThe physical implications of horseshoe chaos on SH-induced wave breaking could\nbe tested by modifying existing numerical algorithms in the literature, such as the\nalgorithm in Longuet-Higgins & Dommermuth (1997), by adding weak damping and\nexplicit forcing.\nREFERENCES\nArnold, V.
