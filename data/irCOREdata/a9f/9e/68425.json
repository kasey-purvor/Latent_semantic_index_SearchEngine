It can occur in several ways: from birth; as a result of\na parasitic infection; or as a complication of cancer surgery. The most common treatments are compression hosiery (e.g. bandaging,\nsleeves, etc.), skin care and exercise. The drugs commonly known as benzo-pyrones have been prescribed to prevent the fluid leakage and\ncollection which characterises lymphoedema. This review found that there was not enough good quality evidence to draw conclusions\nabout whether benzo-pyrones are useful either in reducing lymphoedema or the pain and discomfort associated with it.\nB A C K G R O U N D\nLymphoedema is a chronic and progressive condition resulting\nfrom an abnormality of, or damage to the lymphatic system. Any\nreduction in the capacity of the lymphatic system to drain fluid\nfrom the interstitium (a small gap in the tissue) and return it to the\nblood circulation will cause fluid to build up in the skin and the\nsubcutaneous tissues of the affected part of the body (Mortimer\n1995; Levick 1991).\nLymphoedema has many causes but the main ones are:\n1.cancer and its treatment - leading to secondary lymphoedema;\n2.congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system - so called\nprimary lymphoedema;\n3.chronic venous disease of the lower limb - lympho-venous\noedema;\n4.filariasis, a parasitic infection - leading to secondary lym-\nphoedema.\nThe incidence of lymphoedema following breast cancer treatment\nis difficult to assess due to differences in assessments made of diag-\nnosis, measurement and follow-up time. Petrek 1998 andErickson\n2001 conducted systematic reviews to assess the incidence of breast\ncancer related oedema. The included studies assessed its incidence\nin Europe, Australia and North America. Using different search\nstrategies, Petrek 1998 found eight studies which included inci-\ndence and Erickson 2001 found ten, including potentially two\nstudies which were too recent to include in the review by Petrek\n1998. Four papers were included in both reviews although one\npaper was judged to be retrospective by Petrek 1998 and prospec-\ntive by Erickson 2001. Three methods of assessing lymphoedema\nwere included: volume, limb circumference and self report. The\ntime scale used for follow-up also varied. Petrek 1998 reported\nincidence figures of 6 to 30%, however, the table used to explain\nthese figures is unclear. Using only axillary dissection papers, in\nthe review by Erickson 2001 a range of 2.4 to 56%was found. The\nrange in time of follow-up, where available, seemed to result in the\nwide variety of reported findings. The figures for lymphoedema\nof the lower limbs were even less reliable yet it appears to be a\nmajor problem. In many other cancers (for example melanoma,\nsoft tissue sarcoma and pelvic tumours) the treatment often com-\npromises lymphatic drainage routes. Chronic venous insufficiency\nis also a major contributory factor in the development of chronic\n2Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nlower limb oedema, as is filariasis, a parasitic infection endemic\nin parts of India and Africa. Moffatt 2003 surveyed healthcare\nproviders in South West London and found a crude prevalence of\nlymphoedema from any cause of 1.33 per 1000. The incidence of\narm oedema was much higher in women, which reflects the large\nnumber of women developing lymphoedema following develop-\nment of breast cancer.\nLymphoedema can result in significant physical and psychological\nmorbidity. Swelling causes a disproportion in the size of a part of\nthe body and, as such, can both interfere with mobility and af-\nfect sufferers\u2019 perceptions of themselves (Tobin 1993). In addition\nto an increase in size of a limb, the affected subcutaneous tissues\ngradually thicken and fibrose, forming a solid component to the\nswelling (Foldi 1985; Mortimer 1995). The presence of fibrotic\ntissue makes it difficult for fluid in the tissues to drain; affected\ntissues are often described as \u201cwoody\u201d. This explains why estab-\nlished lymphoedema does not respond to elevation of a limb and\nwhy it appears to be more resistant to treatment. Often the more\nsolid limbs are not the biggest in size but, as the fluid is difficult\nto mobilise, it seems likely that a cycle of further fibrosis is set up.\nThe continued presence of fluid in these areas of hardened tissue\nprovides a stimulus to further thickening. Whether the presence\nof fibrosis increases the risk of the acute inflammatory attacks to\nwhich affected patients are prone is not known.\nThe management of this condition involves decongesting the re-\nduced lymphatic pathways as a way of reducing the size of the\naffected limb; encouraging the development of collateral drainage\nroutes; and stimulating the function of remaining patent routes\nin order to control the swelling long-term (Foldi 1985; Mortimer\n1995). Traditional treatments in Europe have focused on the use\nof physical therapies to reduce and control oedema (Foldi 1985).\nComplex physical therapy (CPT), using a multi-layer bandaging\ntechnique (Badger 2000) and manual lymph drainage (a specific\nform of massage) are used to reduce oedema, followed by a main-\ntenance regime of strong compression hosiery, regular exercise and\ncareful skin care and hygiene.\nIn most countries of the world, the standard treatment regime\nconsists of compression hosiery, skin care and exercise. The use of\ndrugs has also gained favour over the last ten years, particularly\nin Australia and Third World countries (Casley-Smith 1993(1);\ndistance from services and climatic conditions may make the pro-\nvision and effectiveness of physical therapy more difficult.\nA number of drugs have been used for this condition and mainly\nbelong to a group known as benzo-pyrones. Formed from a vari-\nety of naturally occurring substances, benzo-pyrones may be plant\nextracts, semi-synthetic preparations or wholly synthetic (Ramalet\n2000). They can be divided into alpha-benzo-pyrones, which in-\nclude the coumarin derivatives; and gamma-benzo-pyrones, which\nare the flavonoids (Ramalet 2000). Gamma-benzo-pyrones can be\nfurther subdivided into flavones and flavonols, such as diosmin,\nrutin etc.; and flavanes (flavanones) such as hesperidin.\nDeveloped originally for use in vascular medicine, benzo-pyrones\nact by reducing vascular permeability (Cesarone 1992; Ramalet\n2000; Roztocil 1993) and reduce the amount of fluid forming\nin the subcutaneous tissues. Among the most commonly used\nbenzo-pyrones are:micronized purified flavanoid fraction (MPFF)\nknown asDaflon, which is a semi-synthetic preparation from dios-\nmin; oxerutins, such as Paroven and Venorutin; escins (horsechest-\nnut) such asVenastat andReparil; coumarins such as 5,6, benzo-al-\npha-pyrone and Lodema; and ruscogenin (butcher\u2019s broom) com-\nbined with hesperidin, as in Cyclo 3 Fort. Much higher doses of\nthese drugs are used in the treatment of lymphoedema than in\nvenous disease. There is a belief that, as a result of reducing fluid\nfiltration into the tissues, the drugs have some beneficial effect on\npain and discomfort in the swollen limb. Claims are also made for\nthe ability of these drugs to increase macrophage activity (Hoult\n1996), encouraging the lysis of extracellular protein which in turn\nreduces the formation of fibrotic tissue in the lymphoedematous\nlimb (Piller 1976(1). There have been concerns about the use of\nsubstances such as coumarin long-term, particularly in the doses\nused to treat lymphoedema. These doses tend to be higher than\nthose recommended in venous disease. Australia has withdrawn\ncoumarin from use because of concerns about liver to\nO B J E C T I V E S\n1.To assess the effectiveness of benzo-pyrones, compared to\nplacebo, in reducing limb volume in lymphoedematous limbs\n2.To assess the relative effectiveness of different benzo-pyrones in\nreducing limb volume in lymphoedematous limbs\n3.To assess the impact of benzo-pyrones on the quality of subcu-\ntaneous tissues in lymphoedematous limbs\n4.To assess the effect of benzo-pyrones on pain or discomfort in\nlymphoedematous limbs\n5.To assess the impact of benzo-pyrones on the lymphoedema\npatient\u2019s quality of life\n6.To assess the incidence of adverse effects associated with benzo-\npyrones\nM E T H O D S\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\nTypes of studies\n3Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nOnly randomised controlled clinical trials were included in this\nreview. If crossover designs were used, the data were analysed up\nto the point of crossover.\nTypes of participants\nStudies that recruited adults (18 years of age and older) with a\ndiagnosis of lymphoedema.\nLymphoedema was defined as clinically detectable oedema from a\nperipheral cause and of greater duration than 3 months.\nFor patients with unilateral oedema, the increase in limb volume\nof the swollen limb had to be at least 10% above that of the contra-\nlateral normal limb volume. This cut-off point is based on infor-\nmation regarding the per cent difference in volume between left\nand right limbs in the normal population, which can be as high as\n8 or 9% (Sitzia 1997). There is no objective means of assessing bi-\nlateral lymphoedema and the presence of swelling was determined\nby taking a patient history, and by subjectively assessing the feel\nand appearance of the affected skin and subcutaneous tissues, in-\ncluding the use of Stemmer\u2019s sign, the inability to pick up a fold\nof skin at the base of a digit.\nNon-cancer and cancer patients could be included; cancer patients\nshould have completed their cancer treatment at least six months\nbefore entering the trial and be without evidence of recurrent ma-\nlignant disease when going into the trial. Participants could have\nreceived prior standard treatment (i.e. have been fitted with a com-\npression garment and followed a regimen of skin care and exercise)\nbut should not have had a course of Complex Physical Therapy\n( i.e. multi-layer bandaging) within the six months leading up to\ntheir inclusion in the trial.\nTypes of interventions\nAny trial that tested one of the following regimes was included for\nconsideration:\n1. Paroven or beta-hydroxyethylrutoside or Venoruton versus\nplacebo;\n2. Coumarin or 5,6 Benzo-alpha-pyrone or Lodema versus\nplacebo;\n3. Venastat or Reparil versus placebo;\n4. Cyclo 3 Fort versus placebo;\n5. Daflon (MPFF) versus placebo\nThe above regimens could include standard physical treatment,\nas previously defined i.e. compression hosiery , exercise and skin\ncare, as long as it was given to both groups.\nThe route of administration could be either oral or intravenous\nfor the different drugs (for example Cyclo 3 Fort cannot be taken\norally) but the route had to be the same for the one drug. Follow-\nup of at least three months was required as it is believed that many\nbenzo-pyrones, in particular Paroven, may take up to six months\nto have any effect. It is possible that other benzo-pyrones may take\nless time to take effect and in order not to risk excluding trials of\nhigh quality that may have reported shorter follow-up periods, a\nminimum of three months was selected for this review.\nTypes of outcome measures\nThe main outcome measure was the measurement of the volumes\nof limbs - volume could be measured in litres or millilitres by:\na) water displacement;\nb) electronic volometer;\nc) or calculated from surface measurements.\nOther physical benefits to be noted included:\na) improvement in pain \/ discomfort scores (using validated meth-\nods of assessment such as visual analogue scales);\nb) changes in tonometry assessments of the affected tissues (where\na validated method has been used such as that described by Bates\n1994)\nc) reduction in the number of attacks of cellulitis;\nd) increase in strength and function of a limb if assessed using\nvalidated measures or scales;\ne) quality of life;\nf ) psychological morbidity;\ng) adverse events.\nPsychological benefits could be assessed using validated scales such\nas:\na) Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD)\nb) Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS)\nc) A disease specific quality of life scale (e.g. Wesley Clinic Lym-\nphoedema Scale Mirolo 1995)\nRecords of adverse effects relating to the drugs were also to be\nkept as both short-term and long-term adverse events were to be\nreported.\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nThe Cochrane Breast Cancer Group register was searched\n(September 2003) using the search strategies of the Cochrane\nBreast Cancer group as outlined in the The Cochrane Library. The\nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane\nLibrary, Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Un-\nCover, PASCAL, SIGLE, reference lists produced by The British\nLymphology Society, the National Research Register (NRR) and\nThe International Society of Lymphology congress proceedings\nwere searched (from the date of inception of the database until\nSeptember 2003).\nThe reference lists in all the retrieved papers were scanned for\nrelevant studies. International experts in the field were contacted\nto see if they held any unpublished data, as were those found to\nbe presenting relevant papers in the conference proceedings.\nNon-English papers were included.\nThe terms used for the searches were as follows:\nLymph?edema NOT animal\na) AND benzo?pyrone*;\n4Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

An eligibility form was designed to aid\nthe selection of papers. All the screening of the papers was carried\nout blinded, i.e. with the authors\u2019 names blanked out and with the\npapers allocated a number with the letter \u201cD\u201d for the \u201cDrug\u201d used\nin front of it, (D1, D2 etc.). A third reviewer (KS) was appointed\nto resolve any disagreement over the inclusion of any particular\nstudy.\nA data extraction formwas designed and piloted before being used.\nData extraction was duplicated by the second reviewer.\nThe following data were extracted from the selected studies:\n1. details of participants including demographic characteristics,\nsource of recruitment, site of oedema, cause of oedema, duration\nof oedema, relevant co-existing medical conditions;\n2. the type and treatment of any cancer including the patient\u2019s\ncancer status at the time of the trial (where relevant);\n3. the experimental and control interventions including drug,\ndosage, route of administration; compliance with allocated treat-\nment; description of the physical treatments used, if any, and con-\nfirmation that CPT had not been used in the six months before\nthe trial;\n4. long-and short- term adverse events separately for each of the\ndifferent drugs (if adverse events were not reported the authors\nwould were contacted)\n5. the homogeniety of the the two treatment groups e.g. in terms\nof severity of oedema at the start of the trial;\n6. methods of assessment of limb volume and other relevant out-\ncomes such as tonometry scores, etc;\n7. details of any financial support that might introduce a conflict\nof interest;\n8. the numbers of participants allocated to each group and the\nnumbers lost to follow-up, or excluded with the reasons why.\nAny data from different psychological scales, methods of assessing\nthe quality of tissues or pain and discomfort etc. were analysed\nseparately. Adverse events were reported separately for the different\ndrugs. Results from the trialswere analysed according to the follow-\nup time.\nAnalysis was by intention to treat if the datawere presented as such.\nContinuous data, such as the percentage reduction in excess limb\nvolume or reductionof volume in litres and any scales used to assess\nsymptoms such as pain, were summarised as standardised means\nand standard deviations. These data were plotted to detect the\npresence of any skew in reporting. For dichotomous data, such as\nthe presence or absence of a symptom, the impact of treatment was\nexpressed as relative risks together with 95% confidence intervals.\nSeparate comparisons were made for each of the types of inter-\nventions. Meta-analysis was attempted where there were sufficient\ntrials reporting the same comparison. Standardised mean differ-\nences were combined for the continuous data. Where there was\nsufficient homogeneity, the fixed effect model was used to com-\nbine the relative risks for the dichotomous data; where significant\nheterogeneity was detected, possible explanations were explored\nand the random effects model used. Sensitivity analyses were con-\nducted of the effects of cause and site of oedema.\nIf significant heterogeneity was found then the following were\ninvestigated as possible explanations:\n1. type of drug;\n2. dosage of drug;\n3. duration of therapy;\n4. geographical differences;\n5. severity of oedema;\n6. whether upper or lower limb oedema;\n7. cause of oedema;\n8. duration of oedema.\nFunnel plots were plotted in order to investigate the possibility of\npublication bias.\nR E S U L T S\nDescription of studies\nSee:Characteristics of included studies; Characteristics of excluded\nstudies.\nFrom the review of titles 63 papers were considered for full review.\nOf these, 15 were included in the review (see table of Character-\nistics of included studies), one excluded (Clodius 1978) and 47\nwere found to be ineligible.\n5Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Only one of these studied the\neffect of MPFF on lymphoedema; the others investigated its use\nin chronic venous insufficiency. Olszewski reported that the lym-\nphoedema study (Pecking 1997) was a randomised controlled trial\nof 104 women with upper limb oedema following treatment for\nbreast cancer. Lymphoscintigraphy was used to assess lymph flow\nat the start and end of the sixmonth trial. Changes in limb volume,\nas measured every two months, was the other outcome. A subset\nof 24 patients with severe oedema were analysed separately and\n\u201cresults showed a significant improvement in the lymphoscinti-\ngraphic parameters in the MPFF group\u201d. The author omitted to\nreport that Pecking found no significant differences between ei-\nther the lymphoscintigraphy parameters or the limb volumes of\nthe MPFF and placebo groups at any point during the trial; the\ndifferences emerged only in the subset with severe oedema. The\nonly area where a significant difference was detected in all those\nwho completed the trial was in an analysis of symptoms: a sig-\nnificant reduction in the symptom of heaviness was found in the\nMPFF group (n= 46) compared to the placebo group (n=48) and\na significant reduction in discomfort in both MPFF (n=45) and\nplacebo (n= 48) groups. The review failed to discuss adequately the\nmethod of randomisation or blinding and no standard deviations\nor confidence intervals were reported. The review also failed to re-\nport information about withdrawals (only 94 patients completed\nthe study) or adverse events, which were reported in six patients\nin the placebo group and eight in the MPFF group.\nIn a review of the pharmacology of hydroxyethylrutosides (HR)\nand their therapeutic efficacy in venous insufficiency and related\ndisorders, Wadworth 1992 included a section on the use of these\ndrugs in lymphoedema. The authors reviewed two reports of ran-\ndomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled studies (\nPiller 1988, Taylor 1993) investigating HR 3g per day over 6\nmonths in a combined total of 48 patients with upper limb lym-\nphoedema following treatment for breast cancer and 14 with lower\n6Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nlimb lymphoedema. In their review of (Piller 1988) they failed to\npoint out that therewas no information provided about the stage at\nwhich the 10 withdrawals from the study weremade: whether they\nwere before or after the crossover point. They reported that HR\n\u201creduced limb volume and circumference, increased limb softness\nand reduced elevated skin temperatures (all changes significantly\ndifferent vs placebo\u2026)\u201d. Treatment also \u201csignificantly improved\nthe sensation of limb swelling, \u2019bursting\u2019 pain, heaviness, tension\nand mobility\u201d. No figures were provided for any of these outcomes\nand no mention made of the fact that all the data in the original\npaper had to be deduced from graphs. Apparently 97% of patients\n\u201creported increased general well-being\u201d while on HR versus 4%\non placebo and 70% of patients preferred the active treatment. In\ntheir report of the second trial (Taylor 1993) the authors stated\nthat HR \u201creduced arm volume by about 10% (p<0.05 vs base-\nline)\u201d. Once again this was a crossover trial with no information\nabout when the withdrawals from the study occurred. A third trial\nBraun 1971 reviewed byWadworth and Faulds found an enhanced\neffect from the benefits of physiotherapy given to 59 patients after\ntreatment for breast cancer, whenHR 600mg\/day was given to 32\nof the patients over four months; but this was an open study, not\na blinded trial. The authors of the review concluded that hydrox-\nyethylrutosides had \u201c\u2026improved signs and symptoms of patients\nwith lymphoedema\u201d and that the recommended dose in such cases\nis 3g\/day. They stated that while the compound was well tolerated\nwhen used for up to six months, claiming that \u201cmost reported\nevents have been mild and transitory \u201d, less was known about its\nlong-term use.\nIn the remaining seven papers (Casley-Smith 1990, Casley-Smith\n1991, Casley-Smith 1992, Casley-Smith 1993(4), Casley-Smith\n1993(5), Casley-Smith 1993(6), Casley-Smith 1999), Casley-\nSmith reviewed a number of trials of benzopyrones. The largest of\nthese reviews (Casley-Smith 1999) was said to include 50 clinical\ntrials. To arrive at this number the trials were categorised accord-\ning to their design and then split according to the grade of lym-\nphoedema they studied, treating each of these groups as separate\ntrials. Thus three of the trials were counted more than once.\nInmany of these review papers there were problems concerning the\ninterpretation of the numbers of patients involved (nowhere was\nthe number randomised and the number withdrawn or excluded\nreported) and also in the interpretation of the results. There were\ninaccuracies, for example in the account of one HR trial (Taylor\n1993): the numbers of participants were reported as 44 when that\nwas the number approached for randomisation and the number\nactually randomised was 31; in another (Piller 1988) the number\nof patients studied was 80 when the paper gave a figure of 50\npatients randomised; in yet another (Mortimer 1995), a figure of\n19 patients, when the number actually randomised was 46. In the\nMPFF study (Pecking 1997) 104 patients were randomised but\ndata are only provided for a subset of 24 with severe oedema who\nwere subjected to a separate analysis; the results on 20 participants\nwere reported without adding that the authors found no difference\nbetween the active and placebo groups. In addition to inaccuracies\nand lack of information, different conclusions were drawn, on\noccasion from those of the authors of the papers. In one (Taylor\n1993), a 14% reduction in oedema due to the active drug was\nreported while the authors themselves reported at most a 10%\nreduction and described this reduction as clinically unimportant .\nIn another (Mortimer 1995), a 30% reduction was reported when\nthe most that could be deduced from the graphs in this paper\n(which were the only source of information) was a reduction of\n4%.\nIn Casley-Smith 1999, after summarising the results of the trials,\na meta-analysis was carried out, including non-randomised and\nopen trials, followed by a series of sensitivity analyses excluding\nthose non-double blind trials and non-peer reviewed papers. The\nconclusions of the review were that the results were robust and\nthat benzo-pyrones were responsible for an overall reduction over\none year of 55-71%, depending on the severity of oedema.\nRisk of bias in included studies\nThe 15 studies included in the review are summarised by inter-\nvention in Additional tables 02 to 06.\nIncluded studies investigating O-(b-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside\n(oxerutin, HR) studies\nThree randomised trials testing HR Table 2 were identified.

Two were of a crossover\ndesign with no washout period (Piller 1988, Taylor 1993); the\nthird was a parallel group trial (Mortimer 1995). The Australian\npaper reported the method of randomisation, saying that separate\nrandomised lists were used for arm and leg patients, but omitted to\nsay how allocation was concealed. Information was available from\none set of authors (Mortimer 1995), who confirmed that central\ntelephone randomisation was used and that blinding was based\non a pharmacy scheme. The other two papers gave no details of\nblinding other than to state, in one of them (Piller 1988), that\ncapsules were supplied by the pharmacy according to randomised\nlists. The HR treatment periods were six months in all three trials.\nTable 2.

In the third trial (Piller 1988), all treatments were stopped\none month before the trial.\nTwo of the trials (Mortimer 1995; Taylor 1993) looked at the ef-\nfect of the drug on unilateral upper limb lymphoedema: all but\none of the patients in these trials had breast cancer-related oedema.\nThe third trial (Piller 1988), looked at unilateral lower limb lym-\nphoedema (primary and secondary to trauma and infection) in\naddition to breast cancer related upper limb lymphoedema. No\ndetails of any cancer treatment given to the patients were reported\nwith the exception of the one male patient with upper limb lym-\nphoedema resulting from squamous cell carcinoma of the hand,\nin Taylor 1993. Patients with active disease at the start of the trials\nwere excluded in two of the trials but the third (Mortimer 1995)\nincluded nine such patients. The original plan to stratify for active\ndisease in the latter trial was dropped due to the small numbers.\n10Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Of the total 127 randomised, the investigators either ex-\ncluded or withdrew 56 participants leaving a total of 81 patients\nincluded in the analyses. Neither of the crossover trials stated\nwhether withdrawals and exclusions occurred before or after the\npoint of crossover, thus allowing the possibility of additional bias\nin the results.\nIncluded studies investigating Ruscus aculeatus and hes-\nperidin methyl chalcone (Cyclo 3 Fort) studies\nWe found one randomised trial (Cluzan 1990), testing Cyclo 3\nFort (Table 3), which was conducted in France.

Cluzan 1996 tested coumarin (Lysedem six tablets\ndaily) versus placebo; Desprez 1985 tested coumarin plus TER\n(nine tablets presumably daily) against placebo for 6 months and\nthen allowed both groups to take six tablets of the drug for the\nremaining 12 months of the trial. No actual doses were given for\neither of these studies. The Spanish trial (Burgos 1999) compared\ntwo different doses of Lysedem (90 mg versus 135 mg) over 12\nmonths; there was no placebo group.\nAll three trials studied patients with unilateral upper limb lym-\nphoedema, two (Burgos 1999; Desprez 1985) stated that all pa-\ntients had oedema following breast cancer treatment; the remain-\ning trial did not report details concerning gender or cause of\nswelling.\nA total of 249 patients were randomised and of these, as 27 were\nexcluded or withdrawn, 222 were included in the analyses. There\nwere discrepancies in two of the studies (Burgos 1999; Desprez\n1985), between the numbers withdrawn and the numbers said\nto have completed the study.

Another trial was conducted in China\n(Casley-Smith 1993(2)), while the remaining two trials took place\nin the United States (Loprinzi 1999) and Australia (Casley-Smith\n1993(3)).

Casley-Smith, was involved in three of\nfive of the trials. His assistance in preparing another of the reports\nfor publication was acknowledged in the paper (Chang 1996), as\nwas his assistance in reviewing the protocol of the another trial (\nLoprinzi 1999). Only two of the reports (Casley-Smith 1993(2);\nCasley-Smith 1993(3)) described the method of randomisation,\nboth used random number tables. In the latter of these patients\nwere matched prior to randomisation to, amongst other factors,\nthe severity of their oedema, however, it was reported that the\nChinese authorities insisted that randomisation be weighted in\nfavour of the treatment group. In practice, this weighting was only\napparent in the smallest group, that of themost severe grade, where\ntwice as many patients were randomised to treatment; the other\ngrades were evenly matched in treatment and placebo groups.\nOne report (Chang 1996) stated that \u201cdouble-blind procedures\u201d\nwere followed but did not specify what these were. The remaining\nstudiesmade nomentionof themethodof blinding.The reports of\nthe Indian trial (Casley-Smith 1993(1); Jamal 1989) raise doubts as\nto how the trial was blinded. In this trial therewere four trial groups\nand two drugs, BaP and diethylcarbamazine (DEC), compared in\ncombination and with placebo. The dose of DEC was calculated\nas 6mg\/kg per day but no further detail was given. Among the\nlist of reasons for withdrawals, the investigators stated that some\n\u201cfound the BaP tablets too big to swallow\u201d and that some \u201cdid\nnot like their reactions to DEC\u201d, suggesting that it was possible\nto distinguish treatments.\nAll of the trials tested the same dose of coumarin (400mg once\na day) against placebo. One of the Chinese trials (Chang 1996)\naddedmicrowave heatingplus bandaging to the treatment regimen\nfor both groups for the second half of the 12 month trial. The\nIndian trial (Casley-Smith 1993(1); Jamal 1989) and the second\nChinese trial (Casley-Smith 1993(2)) were apparently conducted\nconcurrently and tested BaP against placebo, BaP against DEC,\nDEC against placebo, and placebo against placebo. A total of 583\npatients appear to have been randomised and of these, 132 were\nwithdrawn or excluded.\nIn all reports, it was difficult to trace the numbers withdrawn and\nthe numbers included in the analyses; the reasons for withdrawal\nwere seldom given in detail. The report of the American trial (\nLoprinzi 1999) and Chinese trial (Casley-Smith 1993(2)) were\nclearer about withdrawals than any of the others but even here\nthere were discrepancies. In the first of these, a crossover trial, two\nparticipants were reported as withdrawing at the start of the trial\nbut it was not clear from which group; the number reported as\nstarting the trial on placebo first (n=71) was reported differently\n(n= 70) in the first figure outlining the results.\nThe second crossover trial took place in Australia (Casley-Smith\n1993(3)) and gave reasons for the exclusions but did not clar-\nify whether they took place before or after the crossover point.\nThe Chinese trial investigating heat plus coumarin (Chang 1996,\nZhang 1990) had no withdrawals. The report of the Indian trial\n(Casley-Smith 1993(1)), which allowed the inclusion of patients\nwith bilateral oedema, introduced confusion by referring to the\nnumber of affected limbs (n=183) as well as the number of partici-\npants (n=163 out of 216). A table giving details of the gender, age,\ngrade and duration of the oedema of the patients in all four trial\ngroups (n=183) is at odds with the number of patients (n=195)\nwho attended for initial assessment. Nowhere were the figures for\nthe number of patients (as opposed to limbs) reported.\nEffects of interventions\nIncluded studies investigating O-(b-hydroxyethyl)-rutoside\n(oxerutin, HR) studies\nAll three trials used changes in limb volume as the main outcome\nof treatment : two trials (Mortimer 1995; Taylor 1993), calculated\nlimb volumes from surface measurements while the third (Piller\n1988), used water displacement. One trial measured skin temper-\nature (Piller 1988) and twomeasured tissue tone with a tonometer\n(Piller 1988; Taylor 1993). All three trials assessed physical symp-\ntoms.\nThere was insufficient data provided in any of the trials to calculate\nthe per cent reduction, or increase, in baseline excess limb volume.\nStandard deviations or confidence intervals and the numbers in\n21Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nthe groups at the different stages of the trial were missing for all the\ndata in two of the reports (Mortimer 1995; Piller 1988) and for\nmuch of the data in the third, making any attempt at meta-analy-\nsis impossible. The authors of one of the English trials (Mortimer\n1995) concluded that there had been some slight benefit from the\nactive drug on limb volume, in effect the oedema had been sta-\nbilised while the use of placebo resulted in a small increase; but\nno effect on symptoms. These findings were echoed in the sec-\nond English trial (Taylor 1993). The investigators concluded that\nwhile on HR, volume and tissue tone had been reduced by clin-\nically unimportant amounts, with no effect on symptoms. They\ndid not recommend its use in established lymphoedema. The au-\nthors of the Australian trial (Piller 1988) reported that the active\ndrug \u201cshowed significant to very significant improvements\u201d com-\npared to placebo, in volume, skin temperature, tissue tone and\nsymptoms.\nIncluded studies investigating Ruscus aculeatus and hes-\nperidin methyl chalcone (Cyclo 3 Fort) studies\nThe main outcome in this single trial of C3F (Cluzan 1990) was\nlimb volume as calculated from surface measurements using the\nformula for a truncated cone. Physical symptoms were assessed us-\ning visual analogue scores: mobility, feelings of softness and heavi-\nness. \u201cArm quality\u201d was assessed by both patients and investigators\nand reported as \u201cimproved\u201d, \u201cno change\u201d or \u201cdeteriorated\u201d.\nNo baseline data on the per cent excess limb volume was provided\nand the results were reported as reduction or increase of the per\ncent excess volume (presumably mean results). Mild and moder-\nate lymphoedema were also reported separately; as were arm and\nforearmmeasurements. The numbers in the groups at each follow-\nup point were not given nor the standard deviations or confidence\nintervals. The active groups were reported as expressing a total de-\ncrease in the whole limb of 1% at one month; 9% at two months;\nand 13% at three months. In the placebo groups, the total decrease\nwas 0.5% at one month; an increase of 1% at two months; and\nan increase of 3% at three months. The VAS scores for symptoms\nwere not reported and no baseline data reported. Data were ex-\npressed as a per cent increase or decrease in the symptoms. By the\nend of the trial, softness, heaviness and mobility were all increased\nin the C3F group (up by 112%, 33%, 34% respectively) while\nsoftness and mobility were reduced in the placebo group (by 5%\nand 2% respectively) and heaviness increased (5%). It is difficult,\nlogically, to explain the large apparent increase in heaviness in the\nC3F group. In the assessment of arm quality, it seems that the fig-\nure quoted was the per cent of patients and investigators reporting\nthat category. In the C3F group, 70% of patients reported im-\nprovement as against 32% in the placebo group. Presumably the\nfigure for investigators relates to the per cent of patients showing\nimprovement: 75% in the C3F group and 20% in the placebo\ngroup.\nThe authors concluded that C3F caused a significant reduction\nin arm oedema, compared to placebo, and that the reduction was\nmore marked in the forearm than the upper arm. They suggested\nthis is due to a greater ratio of fat to fluid in this part of the limb.\nIncluded studies investigating diosmin plus hesperidin\n(Daflon 500mg) study\nIn the only study of Daflon (Pecking 1997), the main outcomes\nwere lymphoscintigraphic parameters (lymphatic migration speed\nas an indirect measure of lymphatic pumping, clearance and half-\nlife measured as the diffusion of the technetium-labelled colloid)\nassessed at the start and end of the trial; limb volumewas calculated\nfrom circumference measurements using the formula for a trun-\ncated cone. Visual analogue scales were used to assess discomfort;\nheaviness was scored on a four point scale from \u201cabsent\u201d, \u201cincon-\nstant \u201d(presumably meaning intermittent), \u201cconstant\u201d , \u201cinvalid\u201d\n(probably a mistranslation of \u201cincapacitating\u201d). Assessments were\ncarried out every two months.\nNinety-four patients completed the study, 46 on active drug and\n48 on placebo. The authors concluded that there were no signif-\nicant differences between the active and placebo groups in any of\nthe lymphoscintigraphic parameters or for volume over time; no\nactual data were provided. Both groups were reported as showing\nsignificant reductions in discomfort and, unlike the findings in\nthe C3F study (Piller 1988), the active group showed a significant\nimprovement in heaviness. A greater proportion of patients with\nconstant heaviness fell into the intermittent category and the fig-\nures for the incapacitating category did not change at all . Data on\nthe results of lymphoscintigraphy and volume were provided for\na \u201csubset \u201d of 24 patients considered to have more severe oedema\n( 10 on Daflon, 14 on placebo); severe oedema was defined as\nan arm circumference measurement of greater than 2 cm over the\nnormal arm. In the C3F study (Cluzan 1990) reviewed above a\ncircumference of greater than 2 cm and less than 5cm over the\nnormal arm was considered an indicator of mild oedema so it is\ndifficult to see how the above criteria defined severe oedema. In this\nsubset, Daflon significantly improved migration speed and half-\nlife; clearance was not significantly different between the groups\nbut showed a greater tendency to improve in the Daflon group.\nChanges in discomfort, heaviness and volume were not signifi-\ncantly different between the two groups. The excess volume had\nincreased by 13% in the placebo group (n=14) and decreased by\n6% in the Daflon group (n= 10). No values for SDs were given\nIncluded studies investigating coumarin plus troxerutin (Lyse-\ndem, coumarin plus TER, CTR) studies\nTwo of the three studies (Burgos 1999; Desprez 1985) used limb\nvolume as the main outcome measure, the third uses limb circum-\nferences at three set points on the limb. In addition, lymphoscinti-\ngraphic parameters (speed, clearance and half-life) was used in\none of the studies (Desprez 1985), and a \u201cmorphological survey\u201d\nwas conducted using isotope lymphography in another (Cluzan\n1996). All three included subjective assessments of symptoms; one\n(Cluzan 1996) also reported on episodes of infection, and one (\nBurgos 1999) asked patients and investigators to assess efficacy.\nThere were problems with the reporting of the results of trials\n22Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nin all three papers. None reported the numbers in the groups at\neach assessment nor supplied standard deviations or confidence\nintervals. Baseline data was usually missing, making interpreting\nany changes difficult.\nIncluded studies investigating 5,6 benzo-a-pyrone (coumarin,\n5,6BaP)\nThe main outcome measure in all identified trials was change in\nthe size of the affected limb. The American trial (Loprinzi 1999)\ncalculated limb volume from circumference measurements using\nthe formula for volume of a cylinder. TheAustralian (Casley-Smith\n1993(3)) and one of the Chinese trials (Chang 1996) used water\ndisplacement to measure the whole of the limb volume.\nA problem arose with the measurements used in the second Chi-\nnese trial (Casley-Smith 1993(2)), which reported using the trun-\ncated cone method to calculate volume from circumferences.\nHowever it was clear that only half the lower limb was measured\nas the volumes reported were too small for them to represent the\nwhole limb. The authors did not make this point explicit but did\nstate that oedema predominantly affected the lower leg and foot.\nThis was in contrast to the Indian study where the whole leg was\naffected. Even if this difference were so, omitting to measure the\nwhole limb leaves open the possibility that while part of the limb\nreduced, another part did not, a tendency revealed in the French\ntrial of C3F (Cluzan 1990).\nIn the Indian trial, the authors make clear in the second report (\nCasley-Smith 1993(1)) that water displacement was used to mea-\nsure limb volumes only up to 30 cm from the heel (i.e. to the\nlevel of the knee); this was despite the statement that the whole leg\ntended to be affected. In addition, they included the patients with\nbilateral oedema (estimated at 20) in the data analyses by using\nthe mean of the normal limbs in the trial as controls rather than\neach patient being their own control.\nFor those trials not reporting change as the percentage reduction\nor increase in the excess volume over the normal limb, it was\npossible to calculate this figure from the data provided in only one\ntrial (Loprinzi 1999). The authors\u2019 conclusions were based on an\nanalysis that ignored the crossover design (as did the authors of\nthe Australian crossover trial (Casley-Smith 1993(3)). Data were\navailable, however, on normal and swollen limb volumes, which\nallowed results to be calculated for the original trial groups. This\nwas important in the case of crossover trials with withdrawals\nafter the crossover point, since any data after this point could be\nconsidered biased. Standard deviations were reported or could be\ncalculated for only two of the trials (Casley-Smith 1993(3); Chang\n1996).\nThe three trials involving the same author, (Casley-Smith 1993(1);\nCasley-Smith 1993(2); Casley-Smith 1993(3); Jamal 1989) and\nthe Chinese trial looking at heat plus BaP (Chang 1996; Zhang\n1990), all concluded that BaP was significantly more effective at\nreducing oedema than placebo and more effective at improving\nphysical symptoms. In the case of the Indian study (Casley-Smith\n1993(1); Jamal 1989) and one of the Chinese trials (Casley-Smith\n1993(2)), these reductions were apparently very large. The Amer-\nican trial (Loprinzi 1999) concluded that there was no difference\nobserved between BaP and placebo in any of the outcomes under\ninvestigation. There was insufficient data across the included trials\nto draw any conclusions on secondary outcomes such as quality\nof life, pain and tonometry.\nD I S C U S S I O N\nFor many patients with chronic oedema, particularly those living\nin tropical countries or in places where services are inaccessible,\nthe idea of a drug to treat their condition is very appealing. The\nhistory of using benzo-pyrones to treat lymphoedema dates back\nmany years and was perhaps an inevitable progression from their\nuse in venous disease. The main focus of these drugs is to limit\nfluid filtration rather than stimulate drainage; there are also claims\nfor their ability to lyse proliferative tissue. Unfortunately, the trials\ndescribed here do little to strengthen the argument for using these\nsubstances to treat lymphoedema. This is an oedema that results\nnot for the most part from increased filtration of fluid but from a\nreduced capacity to drain fluid. Although some studies recruited\nadequate numbers of patients, it was difficult to be confident of the\nquality of these trials because of the lack of information provided.\nFor the most part it proved difficult to keep a tally of the patients\nrecruited, randomised and withdrawn, making the findings diffi-\ncult to interpret. The quality of the reporting of these trials was\ncertainly too low to allow any attempt at meta-analysis.\nThis review has highlighted the need for consensus on the use of\nobjective outcomes to assess the effects of treatment on chronic\noedema. Limb volume (of the whole limb rather than just the\naffected part so as to pick up any tendency simply to shift fluid\nfrom one part to another) is really the only way to monitor ex-\ncess volume; circumferences, even if taken at frequent intervals,\nprovide limited information. There is a need, where possible, to\nuse the normal contra-lateral limb as a control since factors such\nas weight gain or loss and environmental factors, such as ambient\ntemperature, can affect the size of the limbs. Oedema extending\nonto the body is a relatively common occurrence in lymphoedema\nand is difficult to assess. A sensitive objective method of doing so\nis needed. Lymphoscintigraphy is gaining recognition as an ex-\ncellent tool in the diagnosis of lymphoedema and the differential\ndiagnosis of the various types of lymphoedema. It has not yet been\nproven to be effective and consistent in measuring lymph flow and\nis, therefore, of limited value in assessing changes as a result of\ntreatment.\nThere is a growing recognition that researchers must look beyond\nthe immediate and most obvious problem of size when studying\nlymphoedema and take into account other outcomes such as the\nquality of the affected soft tissues. This presents a challenge to\n23Benzo-pyrones for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nprovide non-invasive assessment. When it comes to assessing out-\ncomes such as pain or discomfort and other quality of life issues,\nthere is scope for modifying existing tools and validating that they\nmeasure problems specific to lymphoedema.\nA U T H O R S \u2019 C O N C L U S I O N S\nImplications for practice\nIt is not possible to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of\nBenzopyrones on lymphoedema from these trials. On an individ-\nual basis, patients may report an improvement in symptoms such\nas heaviness, tightness or aching when taking these preparations\nbut any improvement should be weighed against the lack of in-\nformation about the long-term effects of these drugs. It is difficult\nto see how their routine use could be supported by the current\nevidence.\nImplications for research\nAs with so many aspects of the management of lymphoedema,\ngood quality, properly randomised, multi-centre (preferably inter-\nnational) trials are required to answer questions surrounding the\nuse of benzo-pyrones in the management of this condition.\nA C K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nOur thanks go to the the members of the editorial office of the\nCochrane Breast Cancer Group for assisting in all stages of the\nreview and especially to Sharon Parker and Joanne Telenta.\nThanks are also expressed to the study investigators who provided\nadditional information and were generally helpful.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nReferences to studies included in this review\nBurgos 1999 {published data only}\n\u2217 Burgos A, Alcaide A, Alcoba C, Azcona JM, Garrido J, Lorente C,\net al.Comparative study of the clinical efficacy of two different\ncoumarin dosages in the management of arm lymphedema after\ntreatment for breast cancer.
