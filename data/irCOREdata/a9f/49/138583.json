Within the multi-factor modelling generally performed, the effect of the56\ninitial inoculum size on microbial growth is not, however, commonly investigated; the amount of57\nresource required to produce such a multi-factorial model using traditional methodology (i.e. plates58\nand agar) is often a barrier to such an investigation. Furthermore the assumption that inoculum size59\nhas no effect on microbial growth once growth is initiated would suggest that such experiments would60\nbe irrelevant and some studies have confirmed this. Buchanan, Smith, McColgan, Marmer, Golden61\nand Dell (1993) examined the growth of Staphylococcus aureus using inoculum levels between 10162\nand 106 cfu ml-1 over 4 temperatures; the inoculum size had \u201clittle if any effect on the growth63\nkinetics\u201d. Bhaduri, Turner-Jones, Buchanan and Phillips (1994) stated that in studies with Yersinia64\nenterocolitica inoculum levels between 103 and 105 cfu ml-1 had little effect on the LPD or GT. A most65\nconvincing result with Escherichia coli O157:H7 was reported by Buchanan, Bagi, Goins and Phillips66\n(1993); the effect of inoculum size on the growth kinetics was evaluated using two aerobic variable67\ncombinations: (1) 28oC, pH 7.2 0.5% NaCl; and (2) 19oC, pH 7.0, 5% NaCl. An inoculum range of68\nbetween approx. 101.9 to 105.9 cfu ml-1 was examined. Regression analysis indicated that there was no69\nsignificant effect on LPD, GT or MPD related to inoculum size for a given set of environmental70\nconditions.71\n72\nObservations, however, that inoculum size could have an effect on the duration of the lag73\nphase have been reported. These studies have examined low inoculum size effects (typically <<10 cfu74\nml-1) when populations are exposed to harsh conditions. Augustin, Brouillaud-Delattre, Rosso, and75\nCarlier (2000) showed that the lag time of Listeria monocytogenes was extended when the cells were76\n4severely stressed by starvation. This was observed at very low cell densities and explained by an77\nincrease in the variation of individual cells\u2019 lag time. Indeed these low inoculum size effects are quite78\ngeneral and reflect the distribution of injury in a microbial population, which becomes apparent when79\nsuch low inoculum studies are performed (Pin and Baranyi 2006). Guillier, Pardon and Augustin80\n(2005) described the effect of various stresses on the distribution of individual lag times of L.81\nmonocytogenes, and work by M\u00e9tris, George and Baranyi (2006) has shown the evolution of the injury82\ndistribution of small populations of L. innocua as the concentration of acetic acid in the medium is83\nincreased. The initial application of these \u2018single-cell kinetic\u2019 studies in foods has also been reported84\n(D\u2019Arrigo, Garc\u00eda de Fernando, Velasco de Diego, Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, George and Baranyi 2006). The use of85\nautomated turbidometry in these studies has proven very useful and one point is consistently made \u2013 at86\nhigher inocula, the time to detection is the time taken for the \u2018fittest\u2019 organism to complete repair and87\ndivide. Hence the time to detection of higher inocula (using turbidometry) are those organisms found88\non one-side of the distribution tail. The comparison and the evolution of the distribution injury89\nbetween the population and the fittest organisms following an inimical procedure has been reported by90\nLambert and Ouderaa (1999). Although D\u2019Arrigo et al (2006) state that \u201c the lag times of populations91\ninitiated with small inocula cannot be measured accurately with traditional microbiology techniques92\nsuch as bacterial counts\u201d, the method of Lambert and Ouderaa (1999) allows the distributions to be93\nobtained using this traditional technique.94\n95\nAt the other extreme of inoculum size \u2013 at high cell densities an inoculum effect has been96\nobserved with many organisms, but the phenomenon has been attributed to several mechanisms.97\nProminent amongst these is quorum sensing \u2013 the ability of microbial cells to communicate amongst98\nthemselves (Surette, Miller and Bassler 1999; Miller and Bassler 2001; Smith, Fratamico and Novak99\n2004; Zhao, Montville and Schaffner 2006). The inoculum effect (IE) has also been defined as the100\nincrease in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an inhibitor as the initial microbial101\ninoculum is increased (Steels, James, Roberts and Stratford 2000). Essentially, it is argued, more102\ninhibitor is needed to inhibit a larger microbial load, and this would appear to be a common-sense103\nview. Interestingly, in medical microbiology (where Leistner (2000) has suggested that food104\n5microbiologists look for complementary approaches to similar phenomena) inoculum effects on MIC105\nare clinically important where, for example, high densities of \uf062-lactamase pathogens are found such as106\nin endocarditis and meningitis (Thomson and Moland 2001) and in invasive fungal infections (Gehrt,107\nPeter, Pizzo and Walsh 1995), although the IE has also been considered to be artefactual - \u201can in-vitro108\nlaboratory phenomenon\u201d (Thomson and Moland 2001).109\n110\nBut there are also published studies, which, in contradiction to the assumption given above,111\nsuggest that the inoculum size has a direct influence on the prediction of growth. These studies are112\ngenerally concerned with the growth\/no growth interface (G\/NG) for a given set of environmental113\nconditions. Masana and Baranyi (2000) showed that for identical combinations of NaCl\/pH,114\ndifferences between low and medium levels of inocula were observed, with the medium inoculum115\nmore able to grow at the more extreme conditions. They also reported the increased variability as116\nconditions became harsher, also shown by Ratkowsky, Ross, McMeekin, and Olley (1991).117\nKoutsoumanis and Sofos (2005) described the effect of inoculum size on the growth boundary of L.118\nmonocytogenes for combinations of temperature, pH and aw. Minimum growth values for pH and aw119\nwere found to vary with inoculum size. The effects of inoculum size on microbial growth initiation120\nobserved in their study suggested to them that growth limits for individual cells in microbial121\npopulations were heterogeneous. More recently, Skandamis et al. (2007) have examined the effect of122\ninoculum size on the G\/NG interface of E.coli O157:H7 and again have shown that the lower the123\ninitial inoculum the more its G\/NG boundaries are influenced by stringent conditions. One other124\nobvious explanation of these observations would be the argument used for the IE on MIC.125\n126\nRobinson, Aboaba, Kaloti, Ocio, Baranyi, and Mackey (2001) and also in an complimentary127\nstudy Pascual, Robinson, Ocio, Aboaba and Mackey (2001) showed that the mean lag time of L.128\nmonocytogenes increased with decreasing inoculum size as growth conditions became harsher.129\nFurthermore, they noted that the variance between replicate inocula also increased as the conditions130\ngrew harsher. Above a certain threshold of NaCl concentration (1.2 mol l-1) no well inoculated with a131\nsingle cell showed growth, and a much higher inoculum was required as the conditions became132\n6harsher for the observation of growth. Robinson et al. (2001) argued that that since the maximum133\nspecific growth rate (\uf06d max) was independent of cell history and was uniquely determined by its134\nenvironment (a given assumption), for any set of conditions, a plot of the logarithm of inoculum size135\nversus detection time should yield a straight line whose slope was proportional to the specific growth136\nrate, provided lag time was constant and unaffected by inoculum size (a similar point had been made137\npreviously by Cuppers and Smelt 1993). The deviation from linearity observed by Robinson et138\nal.(2001) implied that population lag was not independent of inoculum size and therefore hypothesised139\na cooperative population effect, \u201cthe ability to initiate growth under severe salt stress depends on the140\npresence of a resistant sub-fraction of the population, but that high cell densities appear to assist the141\nadaptation of those cells to the unfavourable growth conditions\u201d. As conditions became more stressful142\nthe scatter observed increased to about 10 doubling times implying that the variability in detection143\ntime was attributed to greatly extended lags. The hypotheses made by the authors seemed to be144\nsuggesting both the phenomena attributed to high inoculum density studies and to the low density145\nstudies were in operation for the inoculum sizes often used in PM - namely 103 \u2013 105 cfu ml-1.146\n147\nRecently, we have reported on the predictive modelling of some pathogenic bacteria using the148\nGamma concept (Zwietering, Wijtzes, De Wit and Riet, 1992) as an axiomatic base. This concept149\nhypothesises that combined environmental factors (temperature, pH, aw, etc) independently affect the150\ngrowth of microorganisms. The growth of A. hydrophila in combinations of temperature, pH, salt,151\nweak acids and NaNO2 has been reported using the rapid technique of time to detection (TTD), with152\nthe same approach used in studies of Enterobacter sakazakii and Salmonella Poona (Lambert and153\nBidlas 2007a; 2007b; 2007c; 2007d). The method we have developed along with the predictive models154\nused to analyse the data were considered ideal to investigate the effect that the initial inoculum size155\nhad on parameters such as the minimum pH for growth and the MIC of some common preservatives.156\n157\nHerein we describe these investigations and give a possible explanation of the changes that158\noccur in MIC as inoculum size changes and the impact this has on defining a growth\/no growth159\nboundary.160\n72. Materials and methods161\n2.1. Culture Preparation162\nAeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7966), Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serovar Poona (NCTC 4840),163\nListeria innocua (ATCC 33090), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Enterobacter sakazakii (factory164\nisolate, FSM263) were grown overnight in flasks containing 80 ml Tryptone Soya Broth, TSB (Oxoid165\nCM 129) shaking at 30oC. The cells were harvested, centrifuged to a pellet (512g, 10 mins, 15oC),166\nwashed and re-suspended in peptone solution (0.1%). The optical density (OD) of the inoculum was167\nstandardised to OD= 0.5 at 600nm (approximately 7x108 cfu ml-1, Table 1). This standardized culture168\nwas either subject to decimal dilutions (in TSB) or further diluted in TSB to achieve an initial169\ninoculum (Io) of approximately 1x105 cfu ml-1 in the microtitre plate (see Table 1).170\n171\n2.2 Analysis172\nAll analyses were performed in a Bioscreen Microbiological Analyser (Labsystems Helsinki, Finland).173\nIn general the methods of Lambert & Pearson (2000) was used, whereas for combined inhibitors, a174\nchequerboard (grid) arrangement using the method of Lambert and Lambert (2003) was used.175\n176\n2.2.1. Inoculum size dependency of the time to detection177\nAn initial culture with OD=0.5 was consecutively decimally diluted 9 times in TSB. These cultures178\n(250\uf06dl) were placed in the columns of a 10x10 Bioscreen microtitre plate, giving 10 replicates per179\ninoculum size. The plates were incubated at 300C for two days. The optical density (OD) of the wells180\nwas recorded at 600nm every 10 minutes.181\n182\n2.2.2. pH and inoculum size dependency183\n2.2.2.1 Listeria innocua and Salmonella Poona184\nFor L. innocua four plates of TSB (200 \uf06dl) at pH 7, 5.5, 5.2 and 4.8 (adjusted with HCl) were185\nprepared. To each well of the first column of the microtitre plate was placed 200 \uf06dl of pH adjusted186\n8diluted standard inoculum (giving 7.31 log cfu ml-1 in the first column), this was then half-fold diluted187\nacross the plate, giving an initial inoculum range of 7.31 to 4.60 log cfu ml-1 ; this gave 10 replicates188\nper inoculum size per pH. For S. Poona two identical grids of pH (4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.7, 5.2, 5.5, 5.8, 6.2,189\n6.5, 7.1, adjusted with HCl and NaOH as appropriate) and diluted standard inoculum (pH adjusted to190\ncolumn pH, giving ten initial inocula with a range of 4.8 to 2.1 log cfu ml-1) were prepared. Both sets191\nof experiments were incubated at 30oC for 3 days, with the OD recorded every 10 minutes at 600nm.192\n193\n2.2.2.2. A. hydrophila, Ent. sakazakii, E.coli, S. poona & L. innocua194\nThe first row of the microtitre plates with grids of pH and Na acetate (see section 2.2.3 below) were195\ndevoid of Na acetate (pH controls) and were used to examine the effect of pH (range from pH 4 to 7)196\nand inoculum size on the TTD.197\n198\n2.2.3 Weak acid analysis199\nIn general up to 8 identical microtitre plates were prepared as follows; sodium acetate (1 g) was200\ndissolved in TSB and the volume made up to 100ml. The solution was split into 10 equal portions and201\nthe pH adjusted to give a pH range from 7 to 4 (typical target pH were 3.5, 4.0, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.2, 5.5,202\n5.8, 6.2, 6.5). A Bioscreen (Labsystems Helsinki, Finland) 10x10 micro-array plate was prepared in203\nwhich each of the columns (except the wells of the first row) had 200 \uf06dl of TSB added at a pH204\nequivalent to one of the bottles. To the first row was added the appropriate solution of sodium acetate,205\n400\uf020\uf06dl (1%, pH = column pH), and half-fold diluted down the plate, discarding the final 200 \uf06dl of206\nsolution.207\n208\nTo every well of each identical microtitre plate was added a known dilution of the standard culture209\n(pH adjusted to column pH, 50\uf06dl). The plate was then incubated for 3 days at 30oC.The Bioscreen was210\nset to take an optical density (OD) reading at 600nm every 10 minutes.211\n212\n2.2.4. Time to Detection213\n9The criterion used for the time to detection (TTD) was the time taken for the OD at 600nm to reach a214\ndefined value (in this work OD = 0.2 was used). In the presence of inhibitors it was generally assumed215\nthat the time taken to reach a particular OD was equivalent to microbial numbers reaching a specific216\nvalue. Under certain conditions (normally close to a G\/NG boundary and often with reduced217\ntemperatures) and with specific microorganisms, changes in morphology occur (e.g. with Listeria218\nmonocytogenes see Bereksi, Gavini, B\u00e9n\u00e9zech and Faille 2002). No gross morphology changes were219\nobserved microscopically under the most inimical conditions used in this work.220\n221\nTo obtain a precise time for OD = 0.2, linear interpolation of the OD\/time values which straddled the222\ntarget OD was used. This was achieved using an Excel macro which scanned the OD\/time data for the223\ntimes at which the OD crossed the defined TTD criterion.224\n225\n2.3. Model Fitting226\n2.3.1 Inoculum size dependency of the time to detection227\nThe inoculum size dependency was modelled using a simple linear model (Eq.(1), Cuppers and Smelt228\n1993).229\nImCTTD 10log\uf02d\uf03d (1)230\nWhere C = time taken for 1 cell to multiply to the detection value of 0.2 OD and m is the time taken231\nfor a 10 fold increase (1 log10) in microbial numbers for a given, constant temperature (30oC in these232\nexperiments), I is the inoculum size (cfu ml-1). No variance stabilising transform was used in the233\nfitting of this equation to the inoculum size\u2013only data. The increased \u2018scatter\u2019 at the lowest inoculum234\nsize used was ignored in the fitting of the regression line (Figure 2). For a given inoculum size grown235\nunder ideal conditions at a specified temperature the TTD recorded is the shortest possible (in the236\ngiven media) and can be considered as the reference time to detection, TTDref.237\n238\n2.3.2. Gamma composite model239\nThe general form of the model used in these studies has been described previously (Lambert and240\nBidlas 2007 a-d). In the studies discussed herein, the reciprocal transformation of the time to detection241\n10\ndata (TTD) consistently gave superior fits to the observed data than the logarithmic transformation,242\nhence equation (2) was used.243\n\uf0ef\uf0fe\n\uf0ef\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\uf03d \uf0e5\n\uf03d \uf02d\nn\ni\nP\ni\ni\nrefobs\ni\nP\ninhibitor\nRTDRTD\n1 12\n2\n1exp (2)244\nWhere RTDobs and RTDref are the observed reciprocal time to detection (or rate to detection) and the245\nreference rate to detection (normally the reciprocal of the shortest time to detection, 1\/TTDref), The246\nsummation term gives the function for the inhibitory effect of n inhibitors, each of which is defined by247\ntwo parameters, P2i-1and P2i: the parameter P2i-1 is the concentration (normally mg l-1 is used, but248\npercent has also been used) of the inhibitor which gives an inhibition of growth relative to the optimal249\nRTD of 1\/e (approx. 0.368), the exponents (P2i) are slope parameters and can be considered a measure250\nof the dose response. We also define here the summation term of Eq. (2) as the effective concentration251\n(EffC).252\n253\nThe inoculum size dependency of Eq.(2) was modelled by replacing the RTDref by the inoculum size254\ndependent function, Eq. (1), i.e. RTDref = 1\/(C-mlog10I); in the text this model is referred to as the255\n\u2018composite model\u2019.256\n257\nThe concentration of the weak acid and anion produced from the total added salt of the weak acid, at a258\nspecific pH, was calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (3).259\n260\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf03d \uf02d pKapH\nsaltTotal\nHA\n101\n][\n][ (3)261\nWhere [HA] is the concentration in solution at a given pH for a given total concentration of salt with a262\ndefined equilibrium constant given by the pKa.

RESULTS272\n3.1. Time to detection under optimal conditions273\nUnder optimum environmental conditions the time to detection of a given culture will depend only on274\nthe size of the initial inoculum itself, assuming that optimal conditions are inoculum size independent.275\nUsing decimal dilutions of approximately 7x108 cfu ml-1 cultures, OD\/incubation time profiles (30oC,276\npH 6.5) were obtained for A. hydrophila, Ent. sakazakii, E. coli, S. Poona and L. innocua. Figure 1277\nshows the results for A. hydrophila. From the initial standard inoculum (OD = 0.5) it can be seen that278\nsuccessive decimal dilutions display the same OD\/incubation time curve except that it is displaced279\nfurther down the time axis with increasing decimal dilutions. With the 8th decimal dilution, some wells280\n(2\/10) failed to grow within the 2-day incubation time; hence the maximum average OD is281\napproximately 20% lower than the higher inoculants. With the 9th decimal dilution no wells (0\/10)282\nshowed growth within the 2-day incubation period.283\n284\nFrom each of the OD\/time profiles, the time to reach an OD = 0.2 was obtained (ten replicates per285\ninitial inoculum size). A plot of the time to 0.2 OD against the log of the inoculum size gives the well-286\nknown linear relationship (Eq.(1), Cuppers and Smelt 1993 ); Figure 2 gives an example of such a plot287\nfor Ent. sakazakii. As the initial inoculum size is decreased the variance in the replicate data increased.288\nThis was observed in every case studied. Table 1 gives the parameters obtained for all the organisms289\ndiscussed. The inoculum size at OD = 0.2 at 600nm can be obtained from the parameters of Table 1 by290\nsolving the equation for TTD = 0. The maximum specific growth rate can also be obtained from the291\ngradient values given in Table 1, through calculation of the doubling time.292\n293\n3.2. Effect of pH294\n3.2.1. Listeria innocua. The effect of pH (4.8, 5.2, 5.5 and 7) on the time to detection of a range of295\ninitial inoculum sizes (log10 I = 7.3 to 4.6) gave the observations shown in Figure 3. The parameters of296\nthe best fit regression line at pH 7 (C =1163.4 SE = 2.55 and m = 143.5 SE = 0.424) are similar to297\n13\nthose given in Table 1 for this organism although at a different pH (t-test: P = 0.105 and 0.014 for m298\nand C respectively). From the figure as the growth pH is decreased to 4.8 the variance of the replicates299\nincreases especially with the smallest inocula used (at pH 7 the average standard deviation (SDevav) of300\nall the replicates at this pH was found to be SDevav = 3.29 +\/- 1.14; pH 5.5, SDevav = 3.26 +\/- 0.6; pH301\n5.2, SDevav = 3.59 +\/- 0.69; pH 4.8, SDevav = 12.4 +\/- 5.99). Fitting the composite model (Eq. 2 with302\nRTDref given by Eq.1) to the 400 data points gave the parameters described in Table 2, Figure 3303\ncompares the observations with the modelled data. The minimum pH was calculated (Eq. 4) as 4.42304\n(+\/-0.013).Extrapolation to TTD = 0 of the best fit regression lines gives an intercept on the log10 I305\naxis = 8.18 +\/- 0.06 (log10 cfu ml-1) ; from the modelled parameters TTD = 0 occurred at log10 I = 8.09306\n(log10 cfu ml-1).307\n308\n3.2.2. Salmonella Poona. The TTD from the incubation at 30oC of two identical (10x10) grids of pH309\nand initial inoculum size were obtained and Figure 4 gives a plot of the average RTD with respect to310\nthe log10 inoculum size. Out of 200 wells 190 showed growth (the ten wells that failed to show growth311\nduring the 3 day incubation period were all at pH = 4.08, with log10 I < 3.8); the figure suggests that312\nsome of these wells may have shown visible growth if incubated longer. The combined data (190313\nvalues) were modelled using the composite model. Table 2 gives the regression parameters obtained314\nand Figure 5 shows a plot of the modelled RTD with respect to log10 inoculum size. The minimum pH315\nwas calculated (Eq. 4) as 3.89 (+\/-0.03). As the optimum pH is approached, the function describing the316\neffect of the pH tends to a value of 1, hence the curve in Figure 5 (pH 7.1) is given by the inoculum317\nsize dependency only, i.e. RTD = 1\/(C-m log10 I). This can be considered as the optimal-curve for the318\ngiven media and incubation temperature. The model suggests that as the pH is decreased this \u2018optimal319\ncurve\u2019 is multiplied by a constant (for a given pH) which is < 1.320\n321\n3.2.3. Aeromonas hydrophila. The TTD of an inoculum dilution sequence of A. hydrophila (log105322\nCFU ml-1 to log101 CFU ml-1 ) was studied over a range of pH (3.78-6.49). No visible growth was323\nrecorded in any well with pH< 4.56 during the five-day incubation period. A plot of log10 I against324\nTTD for the various pH used showed that a linear relationship between log10 I and TTD exists for a325\n14\ngiven pH. No substantial deviation from linearity was observed (best fit regression lines: pH 6.49,326\nTTD = 673 \u2013 80.5 log10 I, r2 = 0.999 ; pH 6.22, TTD = 747.1 \u2013 95.2 log10 I, r2 = 0.978; pH 5.82, TTD =327\n771 \u2013 92.8 log10 I, r2 = 0.992; pH 5.51, TTD = 884.7 \u2013 105.9 log10 I, r2 = 0.988; pH 5.20, TTD = 1273\u2013328\n151.7 log10 I, r2= 0.999; pH 4.84, TTD = 2359 \u2013 269.2 log10 I, r2 = 0.996).329\n330\nThe data were modelled using the composite model; Table 2 gives the parameters found from the331\nfitting of the model. The minimum pH was calculated (Eq. 4) as 4.52 (+\/-0.05). The values for the332\nparameters describing the inoculum size effect were similar to those in Table 1 (t-test: P = 0.55 and333\n0.043 for m and C respectively). From the regression lines the intercept on the log10 I axis occurred at334\n8.34+\/- 0.29.335\n336\n3.2.4. E. coli (ATCC 25922). A smaller range of initial inoculum (7 initial inocula; log10 I: 5.5 \u2013 3.4)337\nwas used with ten initial pH (range 6.51 to 3.50). No growth was observed in any well with pH < 4.50.338\nPlots of the TTD against the log10 I gave linear relationships for a given pH (best fit linear regression339\nlines for the observables: pH 6.51, TTD = 824.6 \u2013 96.9 log10 I, r2 = 0.990; pH 6.2, TTD = 858.9 \u2013340\n100.7 log10 I, r2 = 0.993; pH 5.83, TTD = 933.9 \u2013 108.3 log10 I, r2 = 0.987; pH 5.54, TTD = 1128.4 \u2013341\n137.0 log10 I, r2 = 0.996; pH 5.22, TTD = 1419.2 \u2013 173.8 log10 I, r2 = 0.999; pH 4.83, TTD = 2305.6 \u2013342\n289.6 log10 I, r2 = 0.992 ; pH 4.50, TTD = 3977.4 \u2013 511.3 log10 I, r2 = 0.987). The data were modelled343\nusing the composite model and the regression parameters are given in Table 2. According to the344\ncomposite model the TTD at a given pH is simply given by the multiplication of Eq.1. by a constant345\nfactor (calculated using Eq.2). The magnitude of this factor is dependent on the harshness of the346\nenvironmental conditions. Table 3 shows a comparison of the ratios between the observed and347\nmodelled TTD at different pH values for different initial inocula relative to pH 6.505 with I= 105.4. For348\nexample a shift from pH 6.50 to pH 4.83 will result in an increase in the TTD recorded at pH 6.50 by a349\nfactor of 2.5. The observed ratios and the modelled ratios are in general agreement. The minimum pH350\nwas calculated (Eq. 4) as 4.11 (+\/-0.05).351\n352\n3.2.5. Ent. sakazakii (FSM 263).353\n15\nPlots of log inoculum, using a half-folding dilution from an initial inoculum of 105.4 (7 initial inocula,354\nrange 5.4 to 3.6) against the observed TTD gave linear relationships for a given pH. During the 3-day355\nincubation growth was observed only in wells with pH 4.24 or greater (best fit linear regression lines:356\npH 6.54, TTD = 742.3 \u2013 91.6 log10 I, r2 = 0.995; pH 6.18, TTD = 734.9 \u2013 90.1 log10 I, r2 = 0.996; pH357\n5.79, TTD = 768.4 \u2013 93.7 log10 I, r2 =0.996 ; pH 5.51, TTD = 854.9 \u2013 102.4 log10 I, r2 = 0.994; pH358\n5.19, TTD = 1084.1 \u2013 131.1 log10 I, 0.998; pH 4.79, TTD = 1663.3 \u2013 200.7 log10 I, r2 = 0.997; pH 4.55,359\nTTD = 2185.7 \u2013 266.5 log10 I, r2 = 0.992; pH 4.24, TTD = 7870.3 \u2013 1074.1 log10 I, r2= 0.976). The data360\nwere modelled using the composite model and the regression parameters are given in Table 2. The361\nminimum pH was calculated (Eq. 4) as 4.10 (+\/-0.06).362\n363\n364\n3.3. Effect of the initial inoculum size on the inhibition by Na acetate and pH365\n3.3.1. E.coli: TTD data from 6 identical 10 x10 grids of Na acetate and pH, each inoculated with a366\nknown amount of E.coli, were obtained. Figure 6 shows the observed data at pH 6.50 for the six initial367\ninocula over the range of acetic acid applied. The pH controls (no Na acetate added) have observed368\nTTDref = 294.6, 331.0, 362.5, 401.5, 443.3 and 474.2 mins for the half-folded dilution from an initial369\ninoculum of 105.52. As the concentration of acetic acid increases the TTD increases; from the simple370\nlinear regressions \u2013 as the initial inoculum decreases the gradient of the regression lines increases.371\n372\nThe data were modelled using the composite model with both Na acetate, (as acetic acid - calculated373\nfrom Eq.3) and pH as the inhibitory effects. The non-linear regression parameters obtained are given374\nin Table 4. Figure 7 shows plots of the observed and modelled data at pH 6.5 and 5.83; they show that375\nthere is a smooth reduction in the RTD as the acetic acid concentration increases or as the initial376\ninoculum size decreases. Indeed the model states that the curve observed is obtained from the377\nmultiplication of the simple inoculum function (C- m log10I) with a constant dependent only on the pH378\nand the acetic acid concentration. Figure 8 shows a plot of the calculated vs. the observed RTD and379\nalso a plot of the calculated RTD vs. the error (calculated RTD-observed RTD) for E. coli. There is an380\n16\nexcellent agreement between the modelled and observed data and the stochastic assumption (that the381\nreciprocal transformation stabilises the variance) appears valid.382\n383\n3.3.2. L. innocua. TTD data from 8 identical 10 x10 grids of Na acetate and pH each inoculated with a384\nknown amount of L.innocua (7 half-fold dilutions from an initial 1x105 cfu ml-1 culture) were385\nobtained; 410\/800 wells showed growth within the 3-day incubation period. The growth data were386\nmodelled using the composite equation and the regression parameters found are given in Table 4.387\nFrom plots of the calculated RTD against the observed RTD along with the error plot (calc. RTD \u2013388\nobs. RTD) the best fit regression lines were obtained: RTDobs = 1.002 RTDcalc - 3x10-6, r2=0.991; error389\n= -0.002 RTDcalc + 3x10-6, r2 = 0.0004 (data not shown).390\n391\nEquation 2 was applied to each individual data set (with constant initial inoculum) and the parameters392\nPi for i = 1 to 4 obtained (Table 5). T-tests were performed on all combinations and in no case were393\nthere statistically significant differences (P<0.05) between any of the parameters for Pi with i = 1 to 4;394\nfor example between the highest and lowest inocula the t-test gave P =0.565, 0.234, 0.632 and 0.429395\nfor P1 to P4 respectively. The minimum pH for growth (4.53 +\/-0.015) and MIC of acetic acid (968 +\/-396\n48 mg l-1) were obtained using Eq.3. From Table 5 the calculated pHmin for L. innocua is not397\nstatistically significantly different over the range of inocula investigated. Interestingly, the MIC of398\nacetic acid shows a slight rise with decreasing inoculum size, however, the confidence intervals also399\nincrease with decreasing inoculum size and this is not statistically significant.400\n401\n3.3.3. Salmonella Poona; TTD data from 5 identical 10 x10 grids of Na acetate and pH each inoculated402\nwith a known amount of S.Poona (4 half-fold dilutions from an initial 2x105 cfu ml-1 culture) were403\nobtained; 309\/500 wells showed growth within the 3-day incubation period. The growth data were404\nmodelled using the composite equation and the regression parameters found are given in Table 4. The405\nminimum pH for growth (3.80 +\/-0.04) and MIC of acetic acid (917 +\/-62 mg l-1) were obtained using406\nEq.4. From plots of the calculated RTD against the observed RTD along with the error plot (calc.407\n17\nRTD \u2013 obs. RTD) the best fit regression lines were obtained: RTDobs = 1.0023 RTDcalc - 5x10-6,408\nr2=0.993; error = -0.0023 RTDcalc + 5x10-6, r2 = 0.0008 (data not shown).409\n410\n3.3.3. Aeromonas hydrophila; TTD data from 5 identical 10 x10 grids of Na acetate and pH each411\ninoculated with a known amount of A. hydrophila (4 decimal dilutions from an initial 1x105 cfu ml-1412\nculture) were obtained; 250\/500 wells showed growth within the 3-day incubation period. The413\ngrowth data were modelled using the composite equation and the regression parameters found are414\ngiven in Table 4. The minimum pH for growth (4.54 +\/-0.03) and MIC of acetic acid (343 +\/-20 mg l-415\n1) were obtained using Eq.4. From plots of the calculated RTD against the observed RTD along with416\nthe error plot (calc. RTD \u2013 obs. RTD) the best fit regression lines were obtained as RTDobs = 0.996417\nRTDcalc + 9x10-6, r2=0.996; error = 0.0044 RTDcalc - 9x10-6, r2 = 0.0046 (data not shown).418\n419\n3.3.4. Ent. skazakii; TTD data from 5 identical 10 x10 grids of Na acetate and pH each inoculated with420\na known amount of Ent. sakazakii (4 decimal dilutions from an initial 1x106 cfu ml-1 culture) were421\nobtained; 338\/500 wells showed growth within a 5-day incubation period. The growth data were422\nmodelled using the composite equation and the regression parameters found are given in Table 4. The423\nminimum pH for growth (4.09 +\/-0.06) and MIC of acetic acid (529 +\/-65 mg l-1) were obtained using424\nEq.4. A plot of the calculated RTD against the observed RTD along with the error plot (calc. RTD \u2013425\nobs. RTD) gave the best fit regression lines as RTDobs = 0.982 RTDcalc + 5x10-5, r2=0.985; error = -426\n0.018 RTDcalc - 5x10-5, r2 = 0.0215.427\n428\n3.4. Effective Concentration429\nOne difficulty with multifactor data is graphically displaying the observed and modelled data. From430\nEq.2. the effect of pH and that of acetic acid on the growth of an organism can be separated, i.e. they431\nare independent. This allows us to define the effective concentration (EffC) of the applied inhibitors as432\nthe summation term given in Eq.2. If a plot of the effective concentration calculated from the433\nparameters given in Table 4, against the RTD for example for A. hydrophila, is made (Figure 9) then434\nat low EffC the RTDref is obtained. As the EffC increases the RTD for a given inoculum size435\n18\ndecreases, but the ratio of RTD between different inoculum sizes, as predicted by the model, is436\nmaintained. For the decimal dilution used the ratios of RTD between the highest an lowest inocula for437\nall EffC is 1: 0.767: 0.622:0.524: 0.452 (where the ratio is the TTD observed \/ TTD of the highest438\ninoculum for a given EffC); at EffC = 0.0357 (pH =6.49, no added Na acetate) the observed ratios are439\n1: 0.770: 0.628: 0.538:0.454 for 105 : 105 : 104 : 103 : 102 :101 respectively; at EffC = 1.301, (e.g. pH440\n5.2 & 240 mg l -1 Na acetate) the observed ratios are 1: 0.757: 0.594: 0.539: 0.447. From Figure 9 this441\ncan be seen as a simple scaling of the curve obtained for I = 105 using these ratios as scaling factors.442\n19\n4. Discussion443\n4.1. The standard inoculum size-incubation time curve444\nUnder optimal conditions, or specified conditions (e.g. temperature and media,) the time to detection445\nof decimal or other serial dilutions from a standard inoculum will give a linear relationship between446\nthe log of the initial inoculum size and the TTD. At very low cell densities (<10 per well), the447\nprobability of obtaining a well with no resident cell increases and the variance in the data increases448\nwith decreasing cell density. At very high cell densities, other factors such as quorum sensing may be449\nin operation, but at the cell densities used in these studies no high inoculum deviation from the straight450\nline regression was observed. For each bacterial species studied the simple linear model, Eq.1. was451\nused to obtain the two growth parameters, m and C. Although the variance increased at the low cell452\ndensities no variance stabilisation was used on the linear regression as this had little impact on the453\nresults obtained. Furthermore at the low cell densities, although it might be expected to see a skewed454\ndistribution of TTD, in no case was this observed, although only ten replicates were done per455\ninoculum size.456\n457\nThe use of OD = 0.2 at 600nm as the criterion for the time to detection was chosen for ease of data458\nanalysis. From figure 1, it can be seen that any specific OD can be chosen and indeed if, for example,459\nwith Ent. Sakazakii the TTD criterion is changed to OD = 0.55 at 600nm, then from the observed data460\nTTD = 790.8 (+\/-6.95) - 82.3 (+\/-1.5) log10 I. The gradients obtained at OD = 0.2 and OD = 0.55 are461\nstatistically equivalent (t-test; P = 0.38) whereas the intercept has increased to accommodate the new462\ncriterion. A lower OD value or a shorter wavelength could also be used -chosen for the convenience of463\nthe media and\/or the added inhibitors being studied.464\n465\n4.2. The composite Gamma function: inoculum size and inhibitors466\nPrevious work (Lambert and Bidlas 2007a) had shown that a general Gamma model of which Eq.2, is467\nthe form using the reciprocal transformation to stabilise data variance, was able to model the affect of468\nseveral combined inhibitors (pH, salt, weak acids). Those studies used a standard inoculum of 105 cfu469\n20\nml-1 and under optimal conditions (for a given temperature with no added inhibitors at an optimal pH)470\nthe reference TTD was a characteristic of the organism used. It was further shown (Lambert and471\nBidlas 2007c) that at different temperatures (range 25 \u2013 41oC) for Ent. sakazakii, although the TTDref472\nfollowed the expectations of the Cardinal Temperature Model (Rosso, Lobry and Flandrois 1993) the473\ninhibitor parameters were constant.474\n475\nSince it was already known that TTDref was dependent on the initial inoculum size the476\nsimplest alteration to the original Gamma model was to replace TTDref with Eq.1. This, at face value,477\nappeared to go against the work described in the introduction on the G\/NG studies. Since the G\/NG478\nboundary changed with inoculum size and since it has been shown that MIC was dependent on479\ninoculum size, the new model would be unable to reproduce these effects. Specifically, the parameters480\nP2i-1 of Eq.2. should be dependent on inoculum size since these parameters are akin to the MIC, indeed481\nEq.4 defines MIC on the basis of the parameters P2i-1 and P2i (the slope parameter).482\n483\nThe composite model, however, makes the prediction that for a given set of environmental484\nfactors the inoculum size dependency of the TTD (Eq.1) will be simply multiplied by a factor given by485\nEq.2. This implies that the linear relationship between TTD and log10 inoculum size will be preserved.486\nFurthermore, the inhibitory parameters P2i-1 and P2i would be independent of inoculum size.487\n488\nThe analysis of the TTD data obtained using the composite Gamma model for combinations of489\ninoculum size and pH and for inoculum size, pH and Na acetate (the reciprocal of Eq.1 replacing490\nRTDref of Eq.2) has shown that the parameters P2i-1 and P2i of Eq.2. are conserved and that the491\ninoculum size parameters (m and C) are also conserved. Figures 3, 4 and 6 directly show that as the492\npH is lowered the gradient of the log inoculum against TTD increases, but that the linear nature of the493\nrelationship between TTD and log10 I is preserved. The variance (Fig.3) also increases with decreasing494\npH over the range of inoculum sizes used and does show an elevated variance at the lowest inoculum495\nlevels used.496\n497\n21\nFigure 6 shows that at a given pH, there appears to be a simple relationship between inoculum size and498\nacetic acid concentration. With decreasing inoculum size, the intercept and the gradient of the499\nTTD\/acetic acid concentration plots increase. For a given pH, and with an inoculum size dependency500\nof the TTDref given by Eq.1, Eq.2. can be written as501\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf0ef\uf0fe\n\uf0ef\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\n...1)log('\nexp)log(\n4\n4\n3\n10\n3\n10\nP\nP\nP\nAcH\nImCK\nP\nAcH\nKImCTTD\n,502\nwhere AcH is the acetic acid concentration (mg l-1) and K = (10-pH\/P1)P2.503\n504\nFrom this expansion we can see that the intercept of Fig.6 (when AcH = 0) is given by K\u2019(C-mlog10I);505\nK\u2019 is simply a constant due to the inhibition caused by pH alone (pH = 6.505), which increases the506\nTTDref by a factor of 1.10. If the values of C and m in Table 4 are used, then for a given log10 I,507\nmultiplication by K\u2019 gives the approximate value for the intercept of the best fit regression lines given508\nin Figure 6. Hence the prediction of the model that for a given set of environmental factors, the509\ninoculum size dependency of the TTD (Eq.1) is simply multiplied by a factor given by Eq.2. Over the510\nacetic acid concentration range 0.5 \u2013 140 mg l-1 the model gives an approximate linear relationship511\nbetween TTD and AcH, with an increasing gradient with decreasing inoculum size.512\n513\nFigure 4 and 5 show that the observed and modelled RTD data are in excellent agreement over the pH514\nrange studied. The former figure suggests a pH optimum between 6.52 and 7.09 for S.Poona, which515\nthe model in its current guise does not allow for (the model is based on hydrogen ion concentration516\nrather than pH and does not have a pH optimum built in).517\n518\n4.3 Inoculum size dependency on the value of MIC519\nThe composite model for inoculum size and the effect of environmental factors described above leads520\nto the conclusion that the inhibitory parameters obtained from the non-linear regression analysis are521\n22\nindependent of the initial inoculum size. The demonstration that this conclusion is not contrary to the522\nobservations made by for example by Masana and Baranyi (2000), Koutsoumanis and Sofos (2005)523\nand also by Robinson et al (2001) has to be made. The one thing that these fore mentioned studies524\nhave in common was that they were conducted over a specified timeframe.525\n526\nThe calculated MIC is defined by Eq.(4) and is independent of time, being a concentration527\nvalue calculated for a specific level of inhibition. The minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC, as528\ndefined in the general microbiological literature, however, is the concentration required to inhibit529\ngrowth at a specified time, e.g. 18 hours (e.g. Andrews 2000). The composite Gamma model can be530\nrearranged to give an expression relating the concentration of acetic acid required to achieve a given531\nlevel of inhibition in a specified time for a given pH and initial inoculum size, Eq.5;532\n533\n)\/1(\n110\n3\n31\n10\n4\n2\n42\n][\nlog\nln][\nexp)log(\nPP\nMIC\nMIC\nPP\nP\nH\nImC\nTTD\nPAcH\nTTD24hrs,e.g.time,specifiedaTTDlet\nP\nAcH\nP\nH\nImCTTD\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\uf03d\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n(5)534\nThis form of the equation will, for a given pH and initial inoculum size, give the concentration of535\nacetic acid [Ac] needed to obtain TTD = TTDMIC. Above this concentration no growth (to the OD536\nstandard used, e.g. visual growth) will be observed in the time given.537\n538\nFigure 10 shows a plot of the initial inoculum size against the TTDMIC =24hr of Na acetate at three pH539\nconditions using the data for L. innocua (Table 4). At an initial inoculum of 1x103 cfu ml-1 at pH = 4.9540\nno growth is calculated within 24hrs (hence no MIC is recorded). At 1x104 and at 1x105cfu ml-1 156541\nand 400 mg l-1 of Na acetate are required to achieve the 24 hr MIC respectively. A ten-fold increase in542\nthe initial inoculum increases the 24hr MIC by a factor of 2.56 in this case. At pH 5.4, growth is543\n23\nobserved within 24hrs at all initial inocula, the pH is by itself not inhibitory enough to prevent growth544\nwithin 24 hrs. With log10 I = 2, 3 and 4, the total concentration of Na acetate required to inhibit growth545\nat 24 hrs was calculated as 677, 1023 and 1446 mg l-1 respectively. This shows is that the MIC for a546\nfixed time is dependent on the inoculum size used.547\n548\nFigure 11 shows a similar use of Eq.5, but in this case a fixed pH (pH = 5.1) has been used and three549\ndifferent MIC used: MIC at 24, 48 and 72 hours. The calculation shows that as the time is extended550\nthe amount of Na acetate required to inhibit the system at specified times increases and the amount is551\ndependent on the size of the inoculum. For example if log10 I = 1, then at 24hrs, there is no growth552\nrecorded (the pH is inhibitory enough to slow the growth) whereas at 48 and 72 hrs, 603 and 1051 mg553\nl -1 are required to prevent growth at those times. If log10 I = 3, then 360 mg l-1 of Na acetate is required554\nat 24hrs, and 1130 and 1578 at 48 and 72 hrs respectively. This shows that the MIC is dependent on555\nboth the inoculum size used and the incubation time given.556\n557\n4.4. Possible explanation of literature studies.558\nMasana and Baranyi (2000) described the changes in the growth \/no growth boundary of Brochothrix559\nthermosphacta as a function of pH (4.20 \u2013 5.8) and salt concentration (0 \u2013 10%) at 25oC (the optimum560\ngrowth temperature for the organism). They demonstrated that the boundary changed with inoculum561\nsize and stated (a point which has direct relevance to Robinson et al. 2001) \u201cIt was apparent that, in562\nmost cases, once a replicate from a combination presented growth eventually all the others also grew.563\nThe changes of probability over time also showed that under more extreme conditions the time to564\ngrowth, as a kinetic parameter, exhibited increasing variability.\u201d565\n566\nThe model described here gives a very simple explanation for the changes in the boundary \u2013 for a567\nfixed time experiment the boundary line for a lower inoculum will always be inside that of the higher568\ninoculum. Modelling from the published data was problematic since the data were discrete (the growth569\nwas recorded in whole number of days, and therefore there was no differentiation between conditions570\nrecorded as Growth =1 day). Using the composite model (Eq.1. & Eq.2), an initial set of parameters571\n24\nwere used to generate continuous data based on the pH and salt grid given by Masana and Baranyi.572\nThe modelled data were then transformed to TTD and rounded-up to the nearest whole number of573\ndays. An upper limit of TTD of 60 days was used, such that if the calculated TTD\u2265 60days, the TTD574\nwas set to 60 days; no growth data from the published work was also treated as TTD = 60 as this was575\napproximately the experimental duration. From this the deviances between the model and the576\npublished work were minimised; the following parameters were obtained, C = 708, m = 109, the pH577\nparameters P1 and P2 were 5.75x10-6, and 1.17 respectively and the salt parameters, P3 and P4, were578\n4.15 and 2.3 respectively. Figure 12 shows the change in the TTD with respect to pH and salt when the579\ninoculum size was reduced. Qualitatively, the change in the boundary with reducing inoculum size580\ndescribed by the model is very similar to that described by Masana and Baranyi; the large difference581\nbetween the G\/NG border at 106.18 with those of 103.18 and 101.18 reflects the observed data, as well as582\nthe similarity between the G\/NG of the latter two lower inocula. Quantitatively there are some583\ndifferences, especially close to the G\/NG border of 60 days, but this is to be expected given the nature584\nof the data, the fitting and the declaration concerning the variability. At I = 106.18, with salt585\nconcentrations at 10% both the observed and model agree - no growth in 60 days, similarly at all pH =586\n4.4. The model suggests that at pH 4.6 and with salt levels less than 3.5%, growth will be observed587\nwithin 15 days, this was observed except at the lowest salt level (observation of no growth). At pH 5588\nwith salt = 8%, the observed TTD = 5 days, the model suggests growth within 15 days; at 9% salt589\nthere was no observed growth at pH 5, in agreement with the model. With I = 103.18, the observed and590\nmodelled pH boundary = 4.6, with the salt boundary decreasing to 8% (observed) or 8.5% (modelled).591\nAt pH 5 and 6% salt, TTDobs = 7 days, modelled <15days; increasing the salt by 1% results in NG592\n(observed), whereas the model suggests a TTD between 45 and 60 days. At I = 101.18, the observed and593\nmodelled pH boundary = 4.6, and the salt boundary = 8% (observed and modelled). At pH 5.2 with594\n7% salt the TTDobs = 10 days, whereas the model suggests 30-45 days; a reduction by 0.2 pH units or595\nan increase of 1% salt results in both the observed and modelled giving NG.596\n597\nWhen the 231 observations were ranked and reclassified as G or NG, out of 111 observations598\nof NG, the model labels 12 of these as G (10 of which are TTDcalc >15days, only two conditions (1)599\n25\npH 4.6, 0.5% salt, I = 106.12 and (2) pH 4.8, 6% salt and I = 106.12 are very different from the modelled600\nTTD of 7 days); of the 120 observations of G, the model labels all as G.601\n602\nMasana and Baranyi (2001) explained the inoculum size effect of Brochothrix thermosphacta on the603\nprobability of growth and the location of the growth\/no growth boundary by invoking the hypothesis604\nthat population differences in resistance to environmental factors were responsible. The use of the605\ncomposite model suggests that the observed changes in the G\/NG boundaries are due to using different606\ninoculum sizes only.607\n608\nKoutsoumanis and Sofos (2005) examined the effect of multiple temperatures, aw, pH and inoculum609\nsize on the 60 day G\/NG boundary of Listeria monocytogenes. The authors state that \u201cThe growth610\nlimits of the pathogen and hence the position of the growth boundary were found to be affected by the611\nsize of the inoculum.\u201d They further stated that their study \u201cindicates the importance of inoculum size612\nfor microbial growth initiation and provides quantitative data that show how the combinations of613\nhurdles which prevent growth vary with inoculum size.\u201d614\n615\nData for the effect of combinations of aw and pH (10 x10 grid) at a fixed temperature (15oC) for four616\ninitial inoculum sizes were given in Figure 2 of their publication. These data were extracted from the617\nfigures and for each combination of pH, aw and log10 I assigned either G or NG. The data were618\nmodelled using a composite model with initial values for C, m, P2i-1 and P2i. The model produced TTD619\nvalues for each combination of factors, these values were then degraded to nominal values of G or NG620\nbased on a G\/NG boundary of 60 days. The initial parameters were adjusted to reduce the total number621\nof mismatched G\/NG labels between the observed and modelled data. The parameters obtained were C622\n= 7951, m = 556.9, P1 = 10-4.761, P2 = 1.168, P3 = 6.53, P4 = 1.38 (15 G\/NG mismatches- 3.75%).Figure623\n13 displays the results of the model along with the published data. Table 6 shows the results of a624\nsimple contingency analysis; of the 15 mismatches, 11 had modelled TTD of between 40 and 80625\nminutes. The other four mismatches ((1) aw 0.997, pH 4.24, I = 104.2; (2) aw 0.997, pH 3.94, I = 106.81;626\n26\n(3) aw 0.997, pH 4.24, I = 106.81; (4) aw 0.983, pH 4.24, I = 106.81) were observed to grow, whereas the627\nmodel showed NG (modelled TTD = 233, 26663, 173 and 256 days respectively).628\n629\nThe initial values used for the inoculum size dependency and the pH parameters were taken from the630\ndata of L .innocua (Tables 1 and 2). The values for C and m given in Table 2 were obtained at 30oC.631\nBy using the Cardinal Temperature model with Tmin = -0.4oC , Topt = 37oC and Tmax = 45oC, the632\nGamma factors at 30oC and at 15oC (0.826 and 0.217 respectively) were obtained; the ratio of the two633\n(3.81) was used to estimate the initial values of C and m at 15oC (4600 and 533 respectively). The pH634\nparameters were used directly, the initial salt parameters used were obtained considering the lower aw635\nvalue found by Koutsoumanis and Sofos (aw \uf0400.9 \uf040 14% salt) and using Eq.4 to estimate an initial636\nvalue for P2i-1, using an estimation of P2i = 2. The derived values obtained are not surprising \u2013 they637\nreflect the general values expected of such parameters; indeed the calculated pHmin = 4.4, MICsalt =638\n13.8 % reflect the literature pHmin values and the aw found by Koutsoumanis and Sofos (note the model639\nand observed mismatch at the lowest pH values, especially at pH 3.94).640\n641\nThe most important point being made here is that the inhibitory function of the composite model is642\nindependent of inoculum size and that changes in the G\/NG boundary with inoculum size can be643\nexplained as being due to the inhibitory function applying a factor (gamma factor) to the linear model644\nof inoculum size dependency on the TTD, i.e. the change in shape of the G\/NG boundary due to645\nchanges in initial inoculum size (for a given set of environmental conditions) is due to the change of646\ninoculum size alone.647\n648\nRobinson et al. (2001) showed that in replicates the variance of Listeria monocytogenes cells increased649\nwith increasing concentrations of NaCl. Further they described experiments which showed that as the650\nconcentration increased the \u201cnumber of cells required to initiate growth increased from one cell under651\noptimum conditions to 105 cells in medium with 1.8 M NaCl\u201d (approx 9.35%, aw = 0.939). From their652\nwork (Figure 1 of their publication) an inoculum\/TTD plot at 37oC, zero added salt, gave an inoculum653\nsize dependency (Eq.1) with C = 858.5 and m = 109.95 (r2= 0.9898). Comparison of these values to654\n27\nthose of Listeria innocua (Table 1) shows them to be comparable (given the differences in655\ntemperatures). The work described herein would suggest that on addition of inhibitory levels of salt,656\nthe observed TTD values with respect to inoculum size would increase by a factor given657\nby \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 2\n1\nexp\nP\nP\nsalt\n. When the data from the exponentially growing wells were analysed (taken from658\nFigure 1 of Robinson et al. 2001), using a composite model of inoculum size and salt inhibition (using659\nthe logarithmic transform to partially stabilise the variance \u2013 see Lambert and Bidlas 2007a), the660\nfollowing parameters were obtained; C = 852.2 (SE 69.0), m = 110.7 (SE 9.3), salt parameters, P1 =661\n6.84 (SE 0.22), P2 = 2.979 (SE 0.28), for 37 observations. A plot of the log of the modelled detection662\ntime against the log of the observed gave a linear relationship with ln(obs) = 1.033 ln(modelled) -663\n0.236, r2 = 0.947.664\n665\nAgain the model suggests that the changes observed are due to the multiplication of a linear666\nrelationship between TTD and log I by a factor dependent on the added stress. Interestingly, in this667\ncase the variance in the data is much more severe than that observed in our studies with pH and Na668\nacetate. The MIC of salt can be calculated using Eq. 4 and in this case is 9.6%, hence the use of 1.6M669\nNaCl is quite close to this G\/NG boundary value and a large variation so close to the boundary would670\ntherefore be expected as is observed.671\n672\nRobinson et al. (2001) concluded on the basis of their observations that growth under severe salt stress673\nappeared \u201cto depend on the presence of a resistant sub-fraction of the population, although high cell674\ndensities assist adaptation of those resistant cells to the unfavourable growth conditions by some675\nunspecified medium conditioning effect.\u201d The study done using the composite model would suggest676\nthat there is no need to invoke a hypothesis of resistant sub-fractions, nor by suggesting the presence677\nof an unknown conditioning effect; the data are consistent with the idea that the inoculum size and the678\napplied inimical procedure are independent.679\n680\n28\nIn our studies described herein, identical chequerboards (or grids) of pH and acetate were prepared; a681\nplot of the log of the initial inoculum against TTD for any given set of pH and Na acetate was found to682\nbe linear and extrapolation to the inoculum axis gave, for example with E.coli an Io = 7.79 +\/-0.26. In683\nthese experiments, therefore, the lag was constant, although the specific growth rate decreased with684\nincreasingly harsher conditions. We would conclude using the hypothesis of Robinson et al. that there685\nwas no resistant sub-fraction of the population present. Nor would we consider quorum sensing to be686\noperating at the inoculum levels used in our experiments, since this would also lead to deviations from687\nthe model.688\n689\nThe experiments we have performed challenge the idea that the IE is a \u2018real\u2019 phenomenon, i.e.690\nanything other than a consequence of using a different inoculum level. Although we recognise that691\nwhere the organism can alter the concentration of the inhibitor are special cases (usually at high cell692\ndensities) \u2013 this includes certain antibiotic resistant organisms (Thomson and Moland 2001) and also693\nsome spoilage yeasts which can destroy (metabolise) certain preservatives (Casas, Ancos, Valderrama,694\nCano and Peinado 2004). We also recognise the so-called inoculum effect used to describe studies of695\nthe variance of single cells, especially those where a pre-inhibitory step has been carried out; we696\nwould suggest that these be called low (or single cell) inoculum effect studies to separate them from697\nstudies where higher inocula are used.698\n699\nOur experiments have shown that only the reference time to detection (TTDref) is affected by inoculum700\nsize, and this is an easily modelled function. That the data required to model this function requires701\nonly a maximum of 2 days to procure for rapid growing bacteria (see Figure 1) and that this can be702\ndone independently of any other environmental factor suggests that this will readily allow future703\npredictive models to incorporate inoculum size as a common feature. Conversely, a response surface704\nmodel already in the literature could be augmented with an inoculum size dependency by invoking the705\nGamma hypothesis.706\n707\nConclusion708\n29\nThe hypothesis used in this study was the null-hypothesis - that the apparent IE and the changes in the709\nG\/NG boundary with respect to inoculum size were due to the time taken for a specific inoculum size710\nto achieve growth under the given environmental conditions. The model developed to study the711\nexperimental data obtained in our laboratory and from the literature appears to have validated this712\nhypothesis.713\n30\nReferences714\n715\nAndrews, J.M. 2001.
