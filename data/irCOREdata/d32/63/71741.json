Increased frequency of\nextreme rainfall events, characteristics of a changing climate, can also potentially\ncontribute to this problem. An effective real-time flood modelling and prediction\nsystem could help mitigate the worst effects of flood disasters through the rapid\ndissemination of information regarding threatened areas, that is simple maps of\npotential flood water distribution. The development of such a system would be\nparticularly important outside of urban areas where conventional hazard manage-\nment systems do not operate \u2014 for example, the large expanses of agricultural land\nand pasture which occupy flood plains. There are, a number of legal and institu-\ntional difficulties associated with the provision of real-time flood hazard data in an\nautomated fashion and direct to potential impactees on the ground. However, these\nissues fall outside the scope of this paper.\nWhile many watershed modelling software packages are currently available, few\nare well integrated within spatial modelling environments (GIS) and are capable of\nnon-expert implementation. The models require considerable expertise in hydro-\nlogical data and model application and are unsuitable for real-time application\nbecause of the types of data required and the interactive nature of their applica-\ntion. Here we discuss models that are sufficiently simple and robust to allow auto-\nmatic application and interactive interrogation by end users with little hydrological\nexpertise.\nThe application of watershed models requires the efficient management of large\nspatial and temporal datasets, which involves data acquisition, storage, and proces-\nsing of modelling inputs, as well as the manipulation, reporting, and display of\nresults. These management requirements are usually met by integrating watershed\nsimulation models and GISs, generating the capacity to manage large volumes of\ndata in a common spatial structure. The integrated systems are then further devel-\noped by combining numerous software packages and mathematical programming\nsystems, and by incorporating a database management system (DBMS) whenever\nnecessary. For example, the EGIS project by Deckers (1993). Interaction between\nthe user and the system relies on a graphical user interface (GUI), which may be\ndeveloped by a third party such as a university, environmental agency, or commer-\ncial vendor. However, these GUIs vary in quality and sometimes contain exclusive\nfeatures not found in other similar programs. Another problem is the use of tem-\nporally dynamic processes, which are considered a major obstacle when coupling a\nGIS with environmental modelling, (Albercht, Jung, & Mann 1997). Some of these\nsystems are complex and sophisticated, are designed for general purposes, and can-\nnot be customised by users for applications in specific circumstances (Bundock &\nRaper, 1991).\nSeveral researchers (Bennett, 1997; Maidment, 1993; Wilson, 1996) acknowledge\nthe lack of sophisticated analytical and hydrological modelling capabilities in exist-\ning systems. The systems also need to be adaptable for specific application and user\nrequirements. Furthermore, existing systems, including simulation models, also lack\nsome of the essential analysis tools such as dynamic modelling (Van Deursen, 1995),\nwith the exception of PCRaster (Wesseling, Karssenberg, Burrough, & Van Deursen\n1996), needed by watershed applications. Hydrological analysis itself is often\n10 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\nhampered by limited data of adequate quality (Goonetilleke & Jenkins, 1999) and\nlacks real-time data, which are fundamental to the success of any flood forecasting\nsystem. The goal of flood forecasting is to provide a reliable prevention mechanism\nto eliminate disasters and reduce the negative consequences of a hazard. However,\nthis requirement is not often met by GIS and hydrological models. The widespread\nand routine use of conventional GISs in important environmental applications has\nbeen hampered by numerous key obstacles (Albercht et al., 1997) such as user\ninterfacing, data integration, presentation of dynamic processes in GIS and carto-\ngraphic modelling language (Map Algebra). GIS systems are built to cover a wide\nrange of applications and are designed to integrate a variety of environmental data,\nallowing them to work together in a readily accessible manner. As a result, even\nbasic GIS functionality for modelling requires relatively complex software and\nhardware, resulting in substantial operating costs. Another factor to be considered\nis the integration of simulation models, also important tools in environmental\napplications of computer technology, which are capable of significantly advancing\nthe potential of GIS for environmental simulation and understanding. However,\nthis complex integration requires significant programming effort and data man-\nagement (Burrough, 1997). Many model reviews examine the mathematical imple-\nmentation of models and their applications (Beven, Kirkby, Schoffield, & Tagg,\n1984; Clarke, 1973). Unfortunately, these reviews often do not acknowledge the\nseemingly trivial problems that are of significant concern to users and stakeholders.\nOne such problem lies in the difficulties arising from interfacing the models and the\ndata; simulation accessibility to interested groups and the general public is another\nobstacle to overcome. Rather than giving a full state-of-the-art review of watershed\nsimulation modelling systems, impossible in only one paper, we have chosen to\npresent highlights of some of the more recently published literature. We also review\nmodelling programs with the principal purpose of evaluating their real-time capa-\nbilities, interfacing functionality, and public accessibility requirements.\nWe have two goals in this paper:\n1. to review the current status of spatial hydrological models with respect to their\nuse for (real-time) flood nowcasting; and\n2. to introduce a new Web-based real-time model for interactive nowcasting.\nThe review provides the rationale for the development of an integrated watershed\nsimulation model with a Web-based interface that benefits users by easing access to\ninformation and by offering technological transparency, platform independence,\nvisual interaction with data, a multimedia environment, and cost efficiency. Imple-\nmenting Web-based GISs would provide local communities with Web access to\nenvironmental databases and help them participate in the environmental decisions\nthat directly affect them. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section\n2 provides an overview of spatial simulation models for flood forecasting. Section 3\npresents the rationale for the development of WWW-based systems. Section 4 pro-\nvides an overview of the methods used and the results obtained and Section 5\nconcludes the paper.\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 11\n2. Review of spatial hydrological models\nHydrological models are defined as mathematical representations of the flow of\nwater and its constituents on some parts of the land surface or subsurface environ-\nment (Maidment, 1993). Environmental modelling of this kind provides numerous\nbenefits: (1) it explains the physical world; (2) it provides decision support to\nresources and hazard management (Moore, Turner, Wilson, Jenson, & Band 1993);\nand (3) it guides experimentation and research for presenting complex ideas in an\naccessible manner (Burrough, 1997). Hydrological models can be considered as\nstand-alone programs with data loaded via the import and export facilities within\nthe model itself without the help of any GIS package, or as coupled to a GIS system\nthrough an interface solely designed for that purpose.\n2.1. Stand-alone models\nThe stand-alone programs depend on a particular computing platform or hard-\nware configuration such as the Windows-based Watershed Modelling System (WMS\nreference, 1999) and GIBSI (Mailhot, Roussseau, & Massicotte 1997), the UNIX-\nbased workstations Modular Modelling System (MMS manual, 1998), or the DOS\nand UNIX-based PCRaster (Wesseling et al., 1996). They all run from an individual\ncomputer, or from several computers on a local area network that is not necessarily\nconnected to a global network, and are then made accessible to the public or to\nmanagers in geographically separate locations.\nOne of the best known and widely used models is HEC-1, from the Hydrologic\nEngineering Center of the US Army Corps of Engineers, which provides a variety\nof options for simulating precipitation-runoff processes. A new interactive version,\nwhich replaces the command-line-oriented programs HEC-1 (flood hydrograph\nmodel) is HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modelling System). This stand-alone rainfall-\nrunoff modelling program has been implemented on both UNIX (Sun Solaris) and\nWindows NT\/95\/98. It has a GUI, integrated hydrological analysis components,\ndata storage and management capabilities, and graphics and reporting facilities.\nFurthermore, a significant amount of data must be gathered to perform hydro-\nlogical analysis using HEC-1 (Nelson, Jones, & Miller, 1994). HMS is designed to\nbe independent of any commercial GIS, so it has no explicit ties to any of them.\nAnother program that is well known and can be used as stand-alone is the WMS\n(Nelson, Jones, & Jorgeson, 1995). It is a graphically based, comprehensive\nhydrological modelling environment that addresses the requirements of rainfall-\nrunoff computer simulations (DeBarry et al., 1999). If it is used as a stand-alone\napplication, data can be imported or exported to or from a GIS package through a\nnumber of popular files formats. For example, a DEM can be imported from\nARC\/INFO, or GRASS and then used in WMS for further analysis. The\nlast example is the TOPMODEL, which is classified as a distributed to semi-\ndistributed model, and a number of papers and applications of this model have\nbeen presented (Beven, 1997; Obled, Wendling, & Beven 1994). It is not intended\nto be a modelling package, but rather a set of conceptual tools that can simulate\n12 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\nthe hydrological behaviour of a watershed (Beven, Lamb, Quinn, Romanowicz, &\nFreer 1995). Because it has been adapted and applied to suit many modellers\u2019\nneeds, a standard version has not been developed. Some of these various imple-\nmentations are listed in the TOPMODEL manual available at http:\/\/www.es.lancs.\nac.uk\/hfdg\/topmodel.html. Data requirements for TOPMODEL are dependant\nupon the version and the application used. The primary drawbacks of using this\nmodel are the lack of a standard version and the preparation of data for each\napplication that requires a long and demanding period of data analysis (Romano-\nwicz, Beven, & Moore, 1993).\n2.2. GIS-based hydrological modelling systems\nAn alternative to using models as stand-alone, is to couple the model with a GIS\npackage. There are, however, specific problems in GIS-based hydrological model-\nling, but before we discuss them, we briefly need to address some impediments of\ncurrent GIS systems. We can identify four principal areas that impede GIS use:\ncomplexity, interfacing, customisation, and platform dependency. At the present\ntime, GIS systems are large, complex, and difficult to use and have been severely\ncriticised as being elitist (Pickles, 1995). The hardware, software, and data can be\nhighly expensive for most individuals; similarly, the training required to use most\nGIS packages successfully is extensive. Over time, GIS software has become more\nversatile and general, and different user interfaces and useful models have been\nadded, all increasing the complexity of the interface. In its early development, the\nGIS industry focused on system functionality and data handling. However, it soon\nbecame apparent that the evolution of GISs could not continue without developing\na better user interface (Raper, 1991). Several vendors have developed new interfaces,\nwith offerings such as ARCVIEW from ARC\/INFO and others. Whilst these prod-\nucts represent important advances, several modellers were reluctant to use a GIS in\nmodelling because of the complexity of developing an efficient integration technique\nto support the modelling effort (Stuart & Stocks, 1993).\nCustomisability is the term used to describe the process by which GIS software is\ntailored and modified to satisfy corporate, departmental, and user requirements\n(Bundock & Raper, 1991). Each organisation requires a system that is in many ways\nunique to its own structure with consideration to its specific problems, requirements,\ngoals and objectives. At present, most GIS and simulation software customisation\nprocesses are time consuming, require technical expertise in many languages, are\nexpensive, and very often produce poor results (Raper & Bundock, 1993). Schultz\n(1993) discusses the use of GISs with increasing complexity in hydrology and indi-\ncates that some necessary hydrological routines are missing from most GISs and\nnew routines cannot be introduced directly by the user. The last point that is\nimportant to consider is that many of these hydrological models and GISs do not\nsupport multiple platforms. Most systems depend on a specific computer platform\nor hardware configuration. For example, WMS runs on a Windows platform (WMS\nreference, 1999) while MMS runs under Unix environment (MMS manual, 1998);\nArc\/Info, the most popular GIS software, runs on a UNIX platform and the\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 13\nWindows-based version has been released recently. Thus, platform dependence is\none of the issues that restrict users from data and software sharing.\nThe approaches for integration of environmental models with GISs have been\nextensively discussed and analysed by many researchers (Burrough, 1996; Good-\nchild, Parks, & Steyaert 1993; Karimi & Houston, 1997; Maidment, 1996; Peuquet,\nDavis, & Cuddy 1993). Similarly, the integration of GISs and hydrological models is\nwell documented in the literature (Maidment, 1993; Romanowicz et al., 1993; Sui &\nMaggio, 1999), thus it is not our intent to discuss these in great detail in this paper.\nHowever, we will briefly discuss the two methods available for coupling GIS and\nhydrological models: loosely coupled and tightly coupled (Batty & Xie, 1994; Stuart\n& Stocks, 1993). In loosely coupled models a GIS is linked to an external model\nwhere operations are performed in languages such as C or Fortran, which are most\nsuited to this kind of mathematical calculation. To use the external model from the\nGIS, a call to the model is placed to calculate certain parameter values and then\nstore the values back in the GIS database. This method usually involves a standard\nGIS package and a hydrological model such as HEC-2 (Djokic, Beavers, & Desha-\nkulakarni, 1994). It is stressed by Albrecht et al. (1997), Burrough (1997) and Frust,\nGristmair, and Nachtnebel (1993) that these couplings provide access to incompatible\nanalytical tools and \u2018\u2018the difference in the data models and in the way relationships\nbetween variables are handled in GIS and hydrological model\u2019\u2019 (Maidment, 1993)\nsoon becomes apparent. This mismatch also affects the quality, cost, and benefits of\nthe modelling results (Burrough, 1997) because modellers and GIS engineers have\nvery different conceptual views of the real world and approaches to their disciplines.\nThis type of integration requires a number of programs that exchange data from one\napplication to another and possibly a DBMS and\/or number of transfer files. A\ndisadvantage of this approach is that there is no common graphical interface and the\ndata exchange and conversion between the GIS and the hydrological model can be\nvery cumbersome. Loose coupling may also involve considerable work in changing\ndata formats and data structure, particularly if the model has been obtained from\nanother source (Burrough, 1997).\nTightly coupled models are developed entirely within a GIS environment through\nthe use of a macro language such as AML (ESRI Arc Macro Language). However,\nthis type of programming is often not able to implement complex applications and\ndoes not support the same capabilities of procedural programming languages.\nUnlike loose coupling, tight coupling does not require file conversion or editing;\nhowever, it is a complex process and requires a great deal of programming and data\nmanagement (Burrough, 1997) plus a customised menu-driven user interface for\ndisplay (Karimi & Houston, 1997). Thus, tightly coupled models require the con-\nstruction of an appropriate interface that can interact with the data structures of the\nGIS system. Karimi and Houston (1997) stress that both the loosely and tightly\ncoupled methods have inherent limitations for modelling.\nWhile GISs provide powerful tools for spatial analysis, their capabilities for spa-\ntio-temporal analysis are limited (Worboys, 1995). Traditional simulation models\nare effective in complex and dynamic situations, but they often lack the intuitive\nvisualisation and spatial analysis functions that a GIS offers. The increasing and\n14 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\nongoing literature on the integration of GISs with hydrological models confirms\nthe recognition of these reciprocal benefits (Maidment, 1993; Moore, 1996). How-\never, the limitations of current GIS applications for environmental modelling\nbecome apparent because of incompatibility between the types of models and GIS\nand the type of data that are associated with them, as discussed by Burrough\n(1996), Goodchild et al. (1993). When integrating the WMS with a GIS package\nthrough the use of scripts (i.e. AML and Avenue), developers are restricted to the\narchitecture of the GIS and users, including hydrologists and engineers, are forced\nto learn the GIS operating environment in order to create hydrological models.\nThus GIS specialists often perform the job of the hydrological engineers (DeBarry\net al., 1999). Also when integrating models like MODFLOW (McDonald & Har-\nbaugh, 1988) and the MMS with a GIS, the outcome is the development of two\ndifferent processes (DeBarry et al., 1999; Karimi & Houston, 1997): the pre-\nprocessors and post-processors which are developed in order to facilitate the inte-\ngration of software. The pre-processors are tools that prepare, analyse and input\nspatial and time series data for use in a model. The post-processors are tools that\nperform the analyses of the model results. These include a variety of statistical,\nand graphical tools, which can be used to assist in making decision, and a user-\ndeveloped interface to display and analyse results. However, these processors are\nalso designed to create the often complex and cumbersome input file requirement\nand to format model output (Karimi & Houston, 1997), including data preparation\nof spatial and time-series, analysis, and model output file for display in a particular\ngraphic environment. Finally many hydrological processes are time-dependent, and\nhydrological models generally require time-series input data and generate time-\nseries output. Current GISs are not equipped to store or manipulate time-series\ndata; therefore, the ability to store, retrieve, and perform operations on time-\nseries data is crucial for implementing serious hydrological modelling within a GIS\n(Maidment, 1993).\n3. Requirements of the hydrological models of the future\n3.1. Real-time\nReal-time data refers to spatial and non-spatial data that becomes available to the\nreal-time GIS, either at fixed time intervals or after the completion of certain events\nsuch as the arrival of data at a desired destination. Conventional GIS models such\nas data modelling, data management, and software design and engineering do not\nallow current GIS systems to meet the requirements of real-time applications effec-\ntively (Karimi & Chapman, 1997). The key requirement of real-time flood forecast-\ning, however, is based on continuous in situ measurements of rainfall to improve\nthe accuracy of model forecasts. While there have been significant advances in the\naccuracy of quantitative measurements and the forecasting of rainfall using weather\nradar and more prolific and sophisticated rain gauge networks, extensive research\nefforts are still required to develop systems that incorporate real-time data with a\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 15\nGIS application so that real-time data can be obtained with sufficient timeliness and\nrapid nowcasts can be produced. Karimi and Blais (1997) provide a comparison\nbetween current and future GIS systems, arguing that interfacing of GIS with\nexternal systems for real-time processing is nearly impossible. GIS and hydrological\nmodels, however, lack a direct connection with external sensor and devices, resulting\nin limited access to real-time data. These deficiencies can lead to hard-coding of data\ndirectly into the system, making updating at existing data particularly difficult.\nKarimi and Chapman (1997) suggested that real-time GISs must contain algorithms\nthat allow fast responses within time constraints for real-time applications. Because\ncurrent GIS algorithms do not take these constraints into consideration, they cannot\nbe used for real-time applications.\nDespite advances in computing power and programming languages, FORTRAN\nremains the language of modellers (TOPMODEL, HSPF, HEC). Fortran and other\ntraditional programming technologies are not suitable for the representation of\ndynamic geographical systems because (adapted from Bennett, 1997): (1) early or\nstatic binding inhibits the representation of processes that change through time, (i.e.\nwhere one process is replaced by another (different) process); (2) data representation\nand management mechanisms are not provided for the development of complex\nobjects; (3) user defined spatial relations are difficult to capture; and (4) models\ndeveloped by traditional programming languages are difficult to extend or modify.\nObject-oriented programming techniques provide one means to overcome these\nlimitations. Raper and Livingstone (1995) demonstrate the use of object-oriented\nconcepts in the representation of spatial data. Many of the hydrological models\ninvolving simulations and optimisation require significant computer resources\nand run for several hours (Walker, 1991), which is unacceptable in real-time\napplications.\nCurrently, there are three basic systems for providing precipitation measurements\nthat can be used for real-time flood forecasting: first, the conventional telemetry-\nbased rainfall gauges, the most commonly and widely used, are typically connected\nto a base station by telephone lines, VHF\/UHF radio, metro-burst telemetry, or\nsatellite (Latkovich & Leavesley, 1993). A second precipitation measurement system\nis weather radar, which provides data on spatial patterns of rainfall as opposed to\npoint measurements indicated by rain gauges. Meteorological radar is not used as\noften because it is expensive and requires sophisticated technical and engineering\nsupport. A review of radar-based precipitation measurement for hydrological\napplication can be found in James, Robinson, and Bell (1993), and Mimikou and\nBaltas (1996). Third measurement tool is satellite monitoring, which estimates rain-\nfall by observing radiation signals reflected or emitted from the ground and atmos-\nphere. Real-time estimates are possible and, once the satellite is in orbit, the process\nis relatively inexpensive. This method provides large area coverage, but also requires\ncalibration with ground-measured data.\nMost data acquisition systems are interfaced to a data transmission system such as\ntelemetry or wireless radio using standard interface connections such as RS-232\nports. Data can be transmitted from a remote site to a central base station through\nseveral available communication systems. The choice of one communication system\n16 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\nover another depends on a variety of matters: the size of the watershed, the time of\ndata transmission, and the costs. The existing types of real-time flood forecasting\nsystems, which generate the most reliable forecasts, are sophisticated, use very\ncomplex data input and are expensive (Feldman, 1994). For a GIS to be effectively\napplied in management decision-making requires reliable, up-to-date data sources\nbe utilised in building and maintaining the system. Although, flood forecasting sys-\ntems exist in many countries, deployed in many projects, real-time flood forecasting\nsystems are still under significant research and development.\n3.2. Interfacing the user\nDuring the development of a modelling system, the most significant aspect of\nimplementation is an appropriate user interface, for it determines the interaction\nbetween the computer system and the user (Dodson, 1993). This interface permits\nthe application of a variety of tools regulating both the visualisation and analysis\nof the spatial distribution of model parameters as well as the simulated state vari-\nables set at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The quality of the user interface\nconnecting the GIS has become an essential contributing factor motivating people to\nuse GIS as a means of handling spatial data and for determining policies. Frank\n(1993) agrees, stating that the user interface is the most important single part of the\nsystem.\nIn the USA, significant design initiatives have furthered GIS user interface design\nsuch as the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA;\nKuhn, Willauer, Mark, & Frank, 1992). Albercht et al. (1997) stated that the fin-\nished product of a modelling system must include a graphical user interface that is\nsimple to use. Knill (1993) stresses the need for improvements in user-friendliness,\nincluding visualisation and results. Some authors focus on the need to develop an\nadaptive user interface, which provides multiple, customised interfaces for each\nclass of users. For example, hydrologists can be presented with a more technical\ninterface than casual users. Kingston, Carver, Evans, and Turton (2000) also stress\nthe need for the development of an interface that can be modified to match the skill\nlevels of the user.\nGIS and simulation models are used most frequently in professional and academic\nendeavors. Therefore, the developments in watershed model integration with GISs\nare actually the result of the development of interfaces that facilitate the creation of\nwatershed model input data sets (DeBarry et al., 1999). Models such as HEC-1, TR-\n20, SWMM, and others which lack good interface design require intensive data\ndevelopment for input which is often very labour intensive and time consuming\n(DeBarry et al., 1999). Even programs such as HEC-HMS, which are designed with\nan interactive GUI to provide a convenient means for entering data and displaying\nresults, the use of the GUI is cumbersome when it is desired to execute a series of\nmodel applications with alternative sets of parameters (HEC, 1996). Because inter-\nfacing is the most important part of hydrological model development, the need for\nimprovement in user-friendliness, and flexibility is definitely needed in order to\nfacilitate the use of such systems.\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 17\n3.3. Accessibility\nEnvironmental information is usually held in government, academic, and com-\nmercial water institutions. Hydrological modelling tends to remain in the domain of\nthe model developer and to be applied within a consulting framework. The models\nare inaccessible to decision makers who are not specialist modellers (Taylor,\nCameron, & Haines, 1998) and appear to be designed for experts and professionals\nfor use as in-house tools. While data are currently available for public use through\nthe Internet by some institutions and governmental agencies, many of these institu-\ntions, however, provide the data in varying formats and use complicated relational\ndatabases (Dai, Evans, & Shank, 1997). However, some, like the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and United States Geological Survey\n(USGS), have made significant progress toward providing public access, in the form\nof real-time data (Stewart, 1999), to various environmental databases. Unfortu-\nnately, effective use of these data requires specialised software not available to every\nuser. Thus, providing public access and analysis to various environmental databases\ncould help local communities and researchers to participate effectively in environ-\nmental decisions that directly affect people\u2019s lives.\nPublic participation and involvement are important components in the imple-\nmentation of a water resources project.Wood,Gooch, Pronovost, andNoonan (1985)\nstress the importance of public consultation and participation in flood management\nplanning. Recently, geographers have begun to consider the practical and societal\nimpacts of using GISs to support public participation (NCGIA, 1995, 1996). In\naddition, it has long been recognized that GISs provide the user with a flexible frame-\nwork for the development of GIS-based Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSSs;\nClarke, 1990). A GIS is often designed for spatial decision support, lacking the capa-\ncity for collaborative spatial decision-making (Jankowski, Nyerges, Smith, Moore, &\nHorvath, 1997). However, in the future, a GIS must support SDSSs in collaborative\nenvironments (Karimi & Blais, 1997) designed for sharing, executing, and comparing\nmodel results, especially when the decision makers and\/or stakeholders are from\ngeographically separate locations (Carver, Frysinger, & Reitsma, 1996).\nDespite the progress in flood forecasting systems, some researchers in the UK\n(Parker, Fordham, Tunstall, & Ketteridge, 1995) have been critical of the Environ-\nmental Agency for not giving more attention to warning and dissemination pro-\ncesses. More work is needed on increasing community involvement in establishing\nlocal flood warning schemes (Haggett, 1998; Parker et al., 1995).\nFinally, data analysis is not only useful for professionals and decision makers but\nalso for a public that demands openness, as is reflected in legislation such as the\nCouncil of European Communities Directive (1990) and the US Freedom of Infor-\nmation Act (1965), which specify that all information must be available to anyone\nwho wants it. Data accessibility and participation are one of the issues that need to\nbe considered in the development of a successful flood forecasting systems. There-\nfore more consideration needs to be undertaken in order to provide a better simu-\nlation and warning system not only for flood forecasting but various environmental\nmanagement systems.\n18 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\nEight key conclusions can be drawn from this review of current hydrological\nmodelling. These key points include:\n1. Interfacing is difficult. It requires tedious, and complex development and typi-\ncally presents the user with difficult to use and limited visualisation of complex\ninformation.\n2. Knowledge of GIS is required. GIS and simulation systems are complex, diffi-\ncult to use and expensive computer programs, which limit the number of users.\nA detailed knowledge of the underlying GIS architecture is required.\n3. Platform dependency. Conventional hydrological modelling systems are plat-\nform-dependent because every program runs on a specific platform. This\nresults in limiting the number of targeted users that can access the system.\n4. Computer and programming knowledge is necessary. Technical expertise in\nmultiple languages and subsystems are required (e.g. Databases definition lan-\nguage, macro language, C and Fortran, operating system commands).\n5. Customisation of models is very difficult. The customisation required to imple-\nment a GIS can run many times the cost of the hardware and software. With\neach upgrade, the custom software must be updated, recompiled and some-\ntimes rewritten from the ground up.\n6. Limited accessibility for data and analysis must be rectified. Models are still\nmostly confined to research laboratories, water and academic institutions and\nnot widely used in the public at large.\n7. Limited collaboration. There is a growing need towards consortium-based pro-\njects, in which projects are, performed by teams of collaborating modellers\nfrom different geographical locations.\n8. Real-time data acquisition and communication are costly. The methods and\nequipment of data acquisition and communications used are costly.\n4. Aims for developing a novel web-based GIS hydrological model\nThe Internet and the Web are exceptionally important tools, which can potentially\ncontribute to the achievement of the goals of watershed analysis. The benefits and the\nadvantages that the Internet and the Web offer to watershed analysis are openness, a\nuser-friendly interface, interactivity, flexibility, and fast communication. It is rela-\ntively cheap and therefore gives the general public access to a variety of both GIS\nsystems and data of varying degrees of sophistication. This direct access, as a means\nof allowing wider involvement and participation in environmental decision-making,\nis an important prerequisite of watershed management. This accessibility occurred\nbecause of user interface familiarity, portability across many computer platforms and\ncapability to display different multimedia and hypermedia formats. Additional bene-\nfit that is offered by Java programming language is the development of a sophisticated\nuser-friendly interface, which can interact with data meaningfully and efficiently.\nUsers can easily interact with the contents of the database or run simulation models,\nthus creating their own analysis results. These results being spatial or non-spatial\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 19\ndata, hydrographs, still or animated images are processed in a Web server and then\ndisplayed immediately in the client machine from any computer in the world. This fast\ncommunication via the Internet is probably the fastest and the most economic media.\nTherefore, by integrating a Web-based system with wireless monitoring network,\nreal-time data can be obtained and disseminated instantly. These important features\nand tools that enhance and improve watershed analysis are available and therefore it\nbecomes a question of using them efficiently and professionally.\nThe promising step in the development of Web-based GIS systems has been the\nimplementation of the Java programming language (Arnold & Gosling, 1996). Java\nprovides tools for creating graphic, networked, and database applications that are\nessential for building watershed management. Java features like object-orientation,\nGUI, platform neutrality, security, image processing, and multi-threading are useful\nfor building such applications (Alsabhan, Mulligan, & Blackburn, 1999). The prop-\nosed system was conceived through a general need for real-time data acquisition,\ndata management, a user-friendly-interface, and accessibility of the data and appli-\ncations. The primary aim was to develop an integrated system that would overcome\nproblems related to the above requirements. The system was designed to act as a\nmeans of archiving and for updating hydrological data as well as for using data in\na rapid decision support system. The system has been developed with the recogni-\ntion that several user requirements are currently implemented within watershed\nsimulation models. Therefore, the aims of the project are:\n1. Real-time data access and analysis. One of the aims is to provide data accessi-\nbility and analysis by permitting access to real-time data through the Web.\n2. On-line watershed simulation and analysis. A detailed implementation of\nhydrological analysis should be undertaken in order to provide a decision\nsupport system.\n3. Development of a user-friendly interface. A well-designed interface should be\nimplemented to facilitate the use of the system so that users can focus on the\ndata, not the interface.\n4. Platform-independence. An additional aim is to provide data accessibility and\nanalysis regardless of the computing platform so that whoever has access to the\nInternet can run the programs.\n5. Inter-departmental collaboration. A system should be published on a project\nWeb site, which allows users and stakeholders to share data, as well as soft-\nware as means for coordinating activities between users from different geo-\ngraphic locations.\n6. Cost-effectiveness. One of the aims is to use cost-effective software development\nand inexpensive equipments.\n5. Methodology and results\nThe approach taken by the authors has been to develop a system that is practical\nand can be applied to a wide variety of watershed scenarios where rainfall data input\n20 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\nis relayed to the system in real-time. This paper is not concerned with the hydro-\nlogical model used, but rather with the provision of a methodology for a rapid, easy-\nto-use, and cost-effective means for implementing watershed simulation models.\n5.1. Data and DBMSs\nThe data capture requirement is two-fold (Worboys, 1995). First, it must provide\nthe physical devices, such as automatic loggers (e.g. climatic and hydrological data)\nand field computers for capturing data external to the system and for writing to the\ndatabase. Second, software must be provided for converting data to structures\ncompatible with the data model of the database, and for checking the validity and\nintegrity of data before entry into the system. The physical devices used for captur-\ning data in this particular project are automatic loggers, wireless modems, and NT\nservers. The data input procedures in this project use rain gauges to measure rain-\nfall. Using a wireless modem, input data are transmitted from the field to a second\nwireless modem connected to an NT server that stores the data. These data are then\ndownloaded in near real-time by File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and stored in a\ndatabase, which is immediately accessible to the GIS model for further analysis.\nFig. 1 illustrates the project architecture.\nA Java-based model is then used to process the data. The primary advantage of\nthis approach is that it provides the end user with real-time data. During the plan-\nning phase of this project, we began our first version with a database connectivity\nFig. 1. Project architecture.\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 21\nthat uses the JDBC approach (Alsabhan, Mulligan, & Blackburn, 2000). However,\nthe JDBC has a number of shortcomings, the most significant being slow perfor-\nmance. Therefore, we upgraded the system using a server-side Java application\n(servlet). When the Web page is accessed by a user, the servlet is executed on the\nWeb server. Unlike applets, servlets run on the server, so they can be large and can\nperform a variety of tasks without taxing machine resources or network perfor-\nmance. Database connectivity using this approach provides a tool that is powerful,\nflexible, and easy to use. Java provides many more capabilities and enhances the\nfunctionality of Web-based data access. A Web data access application, however,\ninteracts with a database and uses the Web as a means of connection with a Web\nbrowser or Java client on the front-end as a common Web server interface. With\nassociated libraries such as the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT; Geary & McClel-\nlan, 1997), Swing, which is a subset of the Java Foundation Classes (Gutz, 1998) and\nthreading (Oaks & Wang, 1999), Java provides the developer with all the necessary\nassistance for the development of user- friendly and cross-platform GIS which lead\nto performance optimisation.\n6. The dynamic model\nDynamic models are difficult to run in most GIS because GIS have been designed\nfor querying and maintaining a static database with static phenomena. Standard\nGIS do not explicitly allow dynamic phenomena to be stored and analysed nor do\nthey provide efficient facilities for iteration through time (Wesseling et al., 1996).\nWe have developed our own hydrological model that provides a quantitative\ndescription and understanding of hydrological processes. The details and operation\nof this model will be provided in future publications as this is not within the scope of\nthe present paper. The dynamic modelling unit is a batch program that runs con-\ntinuously in the system background. The main purpose of this unit is to process the\nincoming data by applying hydrological analysis and then to produce the desired\nresults. The results of this modelling unit are non-spatial (time series) and spatial\n(raster images) of different variables (rainfall, soil moisture, etc.). The program was\ndesigned to store the results in specific directories so that the data loader program\ncan determine when the program was executed. After the data have been processed\nby the modelling unit and the results have been stored in their specified locations,\nthe database loader program uploads the file automatically to the database. Fig. 2\nillustrates the system architecture.\n6.1. The map viewer\nThe map viewer is a Java applet designed for map display. The first page of the\nmodel is the map viewer, which incorporates a hybrid map-display system. Aside\nfrom displaying the two image formats most commonly supported by Java and\nbrowsers, GIF and JPEG, non-standard data files such as large data files held on the\nserver (the DEM for example) can also be handled by Java. To load a DEM image\n22 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\nand the results obtained by applying the hydrological functions (e.g. slope, aspect,\netc.), a rendering algorithm is developed which maps between the DEM elevation\ndata or the function results and a colour palette and then displays the image \u2018on the\nfly\u2019. This client-side program is designed in order to reduce network traffic and\nprocessing burden on the server when displaying large files such as DEMs. Once the\nDEM is displayed, users can select from the different buttons allowing them to\nadjust the map view. To adjust the map view, zoom-in, zoom-out, and pan are\nsupported. The system is also capable of performing animation, permitting users to\nsee more than one image at a time in the same applet frame, thereby allowing a view\nof the changes of a set of images selected by the user. Before the animation applet\ncan run, a Java application was designed that run at fixed-time intervals and walks\nthrough specific directories (rainfall, soil moisture, etc.) to convert the specific file\nformats to GIF. This application then stores each GIF in its predefined directory so\nthe animation applet can process when it is called. Additionally, the applet generates\na legend for a selected map. It also allows users to obtain some analytical statistics\non maps to obtain minimum, maximum, and average selected cell values within\nuser-specified windows, or the whole image can also be chosen to refine the analy-\ntical process. The mechanics of the access and the analytical process are available to\nanyone on the Web who has authorization.\n6.2. Analysis routines\nThe objectives of the data analysis program are to allow the user to set queries and\nto retrieve useful information to satisfy the specific requirements of decision-makers,\nand an important function of the analysis is the ability to predict what will occur at\na location, at another point in time, and under certain conditions. The most impor-\ntant analytical process of the GIS is the provision of capabilities for spatial analysis\nfunctions that are responsible for the manipulation and analysis of the spatial data.\nCurrently, the analytical capabilities of GISs related to the structure of the database\n(raster or vector) are used, and the proposed prototype uses the raster GIS struc-\nture because that raster family is determined to have greater analytical power. This\nFig. 2. System architecture.\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 23\nsystem provides the user with two kinds of analytical capabilities as introduced in\nthe following sections: time series analysis and spatial analysis routines.\n6.3. Time series analysis\nThe time series tool is a Java applet that interacts with non-spatial data in the\ndatabase. To query the time-series database, the user first has to click the database\noption from the main applet page. An easy-to-use form is presented that is designed\nto be user-friendly. Then, the user can query the database by specifying the time\nperiod and the function (Max, Min, Ave) in order to find, for example, the average\nrainfall within a specified period of time. The resulting data indicates the highest\/\nlowest\/average level of any variable within a period of time, and some other infor-\nmation. Or the user can specify several variables and produce a list that includes the\ndate(s), time(s), and value(s) of the time-series data in question. Additionally,\nthe applet supports a selection mode. The form also offers options that modulate the\ninterval and time step of data presented, enabling transmission from the server of a\nmore suitable representation of the time series for the user\u2019s purposes. From the\nmain applet page, the graph option can be selected to visualise the time-series data.\nDepending on user-selected parameters, the graph applet viewer shows changes in\nrainfall, temperature, and other variables over daily, monthly, and yearly periods as\nthey occur. The applet provides the user with the option to view any of these chan-\nges as either line or bar graphs. Fig. 3 shows rainfall time series graph.\nFig. 3. Time series graph page.\n24 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\n6.3.1. Spatial analysis routines\nThe spatial database interface offers the user more flexibility by providing a series\nof drop-down lists to choose from. The user has to select a query (What, When,\nWhere is, or Which), a function (Min or Max), and variable (Rainfall, Precipitation,\nSoil Moisture, Runoff, Recharge), and the system searches the corresponding table\nto produce results according to the query type. To provide the most flexible and\neasy-to-use query interface possible, we have built in a series of questions. The user\ncan select from a drop-down list for the query type, function, variable, and various\nadditional parameters. From these variables, a query can be constructed to satisfy\ngiven predicates or conditions, that is, to define what return row of the database\nshould be projected by specifying conditional Boolean operators that search\nexpressions identifying the tuples to be retrieved by the query. For example:\nWhat is the lowest soil moisture value that occurs in a specified period of time?\nWhen is the highest rainfall value that occurred between two specified periods of\ntimes?\nWhere in the catchment is the lowest rainfall value that occurred between two\nspecified periods of times?\nWhich (where and when) is the rainfall value that is less than a specific value\nAND greater than a specific value?\nTypical queries specifying a number of variables can thus be accommodated, and\nthe data is presented in a result frame. Fig. 4 shows the spatial interface.\nFig. 4. Database interface.\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 25\nThe user can choose from a variety of possible analysis methods, including terrain\nanalysis such as slope (Fig. 5) and aspect. More complex analyses are also provided,\nsuch as accumulated flux, the process of calculating the accumulated amount of\nwater and material that flows over a topological network operating over local drain\ndirection (LDD) maps. Accumulated flux analysis produces a map displaying grid\ncells indicating the amount of water or materials that traversed the cells on their way\nto the outlet (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 shows the analysis interface.\n7. Conclusion\nThe availability of GISs via the Web is becoming a reality in many fields (Doyle,\nDodge, & Smith, 1998). Therefore, the intriguing question of \u2018\u2018Web GIS: Toy vs.\nTool?\u2019\u2019 (Thoen, 1995) has been, in just a few years, answered by the GIS community\nloud and clear. Many non-GIS specialists are beginning to use Web GIS and many\nmajor institutions are moving GIS products and data to the Web.\nReal-time data acquisition is increasingly important in many fields, particularly in\nhydrology. The acquisition of data is becoming more necessary each day, but\nretrieval of that data can be quite expensive. This paper discusses the development of\na real-time Web-based data access system for watershed analysis using cost-effective\ntools. A Web-based interface surpasses the limitation of a traditional decision\nFig. 5. Slope result of the DEM in Fig. 4.\n26 W. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332\nsupport system that stores data, model, and user interface on a single computer\n(Bhargava & Tettlebach, 1997). It is a convenient system and can be applied to a\nwide variety of vital applications necessary for the public good.\nOne of the advantages of the Web is that it generates information presentation on\ndemand (Kutschera, Schimak, & Humer 1996). With the inclusion of Java for spa-\ntial data navigation and temporal data visualisation, a system can achieve flexible\nuser interaction without sacrificing efficiency (Taylor, Ackland, Walker, & Jackson\n1997). Another significant advantage of the Web is that access to it is relatively\ninexpensive and stakeholders can form collaborative contacts. A range of innovative\ntechnologies are being developed that offer different ways of modelling over\nthe Internet. Pieplow (1998) has demonstrated that several other geographical\ninformation technologies are capable of delivering visual, audio, and multimedia\npresentations in support of traditional public participation. Doyle et al. (1998) has\nshown the potential use of Web-based mapping and virtual reality technologies for\nenvironmental modelling.\nOur project exploits recent networking technology to permit Internet users to\nobtain delivery of the desired flood-prediction and management data in real-time and\nprovides the tools to analyse these data. Using the Web to develop data access\nand projected analysis for real-time watershed analysis offers tremendous potential.\nNot only to the benefit of environmental users, but also for other disciplines who\nneed to locate and analyse data. We believe that a Web-to-hydrological model\nFig. 6. Flow accumulation map.\nW. Al-Sabhan et al. \/ Comput., Environ. and Urban Systems 27 (2003) 9\u201332 27\ninterface can play a beneficial role in real-time watershed modelling, as a valuable\nresearch and educational medium (Parson, 1999) and as a link bringing stakeholders\ntogether for collective decisions.\nReferences\nAlbercht, J., Jung, S., & Mann, S.
