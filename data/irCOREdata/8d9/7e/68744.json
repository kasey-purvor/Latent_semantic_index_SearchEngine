For instance,\nBarmby et al (2002) demonstrate for nine industrialised countries that a sig-\nni\u0085cant proportion of work hours are lost through absence, ranging from 1.8%\nto 6% of average weekly hours for Switzerland and Sweden, respectively. As\nwe note later, \u0085gures for the teaching profession fall within this range. Teacher\nabsence incurs direct costs through the organisation and payment of cover for\nabsent teachers. In addition, there are indirect costs in terms of adverse e\u00a4ects\non other sta\u00a4 and potentially on student performance (Ehrenberg et al 1986).\nIn contrast, psychologists have suggested that absenteeism in stressful situations\nmight be implicitly condoned by management because it is seen as a form of\ntemporary relief for the employee, and could therefore be regarded as an e\u00a2 cient\nresponse (Steers and Rhodes 1978).\nDevising an appropriate policy response to absenteeism is therefore complex,\neven more so when it is realised that worker absence can occur involuntarily be-\ncause of physical or mental ill-health, or because of voluntary shirking behaviour\nby workers (Barmby et al 1994, Johansson and Palme 2002). A recent report\nby the Western Australian Government conjectures that up to 50% of absence\namongst public sector workers, including teachers, is in fact voluntary, which\nimplies a substantial degree of shirking (Auditor General 1997).1 Disentan-\ngling shirking behaviour (i.e. voluntary absence) from involuntary absence is\n1 Imants and van Zoelen (1995) suggested that only 20% of teacher absence could be directly\nrelated to what they described as justi\u0085able medical grounds.\n2\nextremely di\u00a2 cult to do in practice. Previous research has attempted to do so\nusing absence spell length. However, as Driver and Watson (1989) argue this is\nunreliable because long spells of absence could be voluntary and a sequence of\nshort spells could be indicative of recurring sickness.\nConsequently, this paper does not explicitly try to distinguish between vol-\nuntary and involuntary absence. Instead, we take the approach of looking for\npeer, or group interaction, e\u00a4ects on individual absence behaviour, and also in-\nvestigate the existence of multiple equilibria in this relationship. A signi\u0085cant\npositive association between individual and group behaviour in relation to ab-\nsenteeism rates increases the likelihood that we are observing shirking behaviour\nrather than simply sickness. There are, however, serious identi\u0085cation problems\nwhen trying to establish whether group behaviour a\u00a4ects individual behaviour,\nwhich we discuss below, and to mitigate this problem our paper focuses atten-\ntion on teachers who move between schools. In addition, we also assess the\ne\u00a4ects of endogeneity bias amongst movers by distinguishing between moves for\npromotion and other moves.\nWe use a unique and previously unused database of matched teachers and\nschools obtained from the Queensland government of Australia. Using this data\nwe estimate cross-sectional and panel \u0085xed e\u00a4ect models for the full sample as\nwell as models for teachers who move schools. The results of cross-sectional\nmodels of absenteeism, though purely descriptive, are also reported to help\n\u0085ll the gap in the empirical literature on the correlates of absenteeism in the\nteaching profession and more generally within the public sector. The estimates\n3\nfor movers suggest that absenteeism is in\u0087uenced by prevailing group absence\nbehaviour at the school. Our \u0085ndings suggest that a worker takes one more\nday of absenteeism if his average coworker takes 12 more days or 8 more days\nabsenteeism per quarter for primary school and secondary school teachers, re-\nspectively. We are unable to \u0085nd evidence of multiple equilibria, which at the\nsimplest level would be re\u0087ected by a bimodal distribution of absence rates at\nthe school level. Figure 1 shows that a bimodal distribution of absence rates is\nnot observed for our population of schools, and we are unable to detect multi-\nple equilibria in our statistical analysis. Teachers on temporary contracts have\nabsenteeism rates 22%-24% lower than permanent teachers, which is consistent\nwith earlier evidence on contract status e\u00a4ects in the private sector (Ichino and\nRiphahn 2005).\nThe rest of this paper is set out as follows. Section 2 contains a review of\nrelevant literature, including a discussion of the notion of a sick school. Section 3\nprovides a detailed description of the data that are used in the empirical analysis.\nIn section 4 we provide a theoretical framework and econometric methodology\nfor the empirical work, which is followed by a discussion of the results in section\n5. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2 Literature Review\nA sizeable literature exists with regard to the in\u0087uence of group interaction ef-\nfects on a range of social and economic outcomes, such as crime, educational\n4\nachievement, employment and ethnic skill di\u00a4erences (Case and Katz 1991,\nBorjas 1995, Glaeser et al 1996, Aaronson 1998, Sacerdote 2001, Marmaros and\nSacerdote 2002, Arcidiacono and Nicholson 2005). Of particular relevance to\nthe current study is Ichino and Maggi (2000) who found evidence of signi\u0085cant\ngroup interaction e\u00a4ects on individual shirking behaviour within a large Italian\nbank.\nIn the education literature, there have been many qualitative case studies of\nthe factors in\u0087uencing teacher absenteeism (Eisenberg et al 1986, Dworkin et\nal 1990, Imants and van Zoelen 1995), but little statistical analysis. Imants and\nvan Zoelen (1995) argued that it was worthwhile classifying schools in terms\nof those that are healthy and those that are sick. Speci\u0085cally, they found that\ncollegial sta\u00a4 relationships and a supportive management style from the school\nprincipal reduced the rate of teacher absence. Furthermore, a recent report for\nAustralia concluded that \u0093motivation and commitment appear to be important\nelements which restrict absence through sickness\u0094, giving rise to a need for ab-\nsent management programmes \u0093that take account of the importance of schools\u0092\nleaders in promoting healthy work environments\u0094 (Department of Education,\nScience and Training 2001).\nThe only previous econometric analysis of teacher absenteeism is Ehrenberg\net al (1986), who focused on providing an explanation of the di\u00a4erences in aver-\nage rates of teacher absenteeism between school districts because of di\u00a4erences\nin sick pay provisions. Average absenteeism was positively associated with the\nuse of sick banks, whereby teachers accumulate unused sick leave, and negatively\n5\nrelated to buy-back provisions that allowed unused sick leave to be cashed in.\nThere was also some evidence to suggest that a larger fraction of teachers aged\nover 55 reduced sick leave usage. Of the variables controlling for school en-\nvironment, the proportion of students living in an urban area and the ethnic\ncomposition of the student body were statistically insigni\u0085cant but the average\nlevel of student absenteeism was positively correlated with teacher absenteeism,\nwhich implies that the e\u00a4ect of group behaviour on individual behaviour may\nextend beyond the in\u0087uence of one\u0092s colleagues.\nMore generally, previous research on absenteeism conducted by economists\nhas focused mainly on the private sector and investigated the impact of both\nindividual (supply side) and workplace (demand side) characteristics (Delgado\nand Kniesner 1997, Barmby and Stephan 2000). Demand side factors that have\nbeen discussed in the literature include \u0085rm size (Coles and Treble 1996). It is\nshown that larger \u0085rms have higher rates of absenteeism, which arises because of\ntheir ability to diversify the risk from absence more easily (Barmby and Stephan\n2000). Clearly, the same could apply in a school environment. Supply-side\nfactors, such as age and gender, have been investigated using aggregate data by\nParinger (1983) and Bridges and Mumford (2001). Both studies found that older\nand single workers were more likely to be absent, especially for men. However,\nDelgado and Kniesner (1997) found the opposite e\u00a4ects in a microeconomic\nstudy of London bus drivers.\nThe in\u0087uence of the worker\u0092s contract status on absenteeism has also been\ninvestigated by Arai and Thoursie (2005) and others. For instance, Barmby et\n6\nal (1995) and Barmby (2002) show that full time workers, or those with longer\ncontracted hours, are more likely to be absent when compared to part time\nworkers. Similarly, Ichino and Riphahn (2005) show that absence rates increase\nonce a probationary period ends and employment protection legislation comes\ninto e\u00a4ect.\n3 Data\nThis study uses personnel records obtained from Education Queensland\u0092s human\nresource information system, and refer to the calendar and school years of 2001\nand 2002 for all teachers employed in the state school system. The absenteeism\ndata is recorded under a number of categories: family\/paternity leave, work\ninjury leave that is covered by employee insurance, time o\u00a4 due to industrial\ndisputes, and absence due to reasons of self-reported illness. The absence days\nare recorded as the cumulative number of days per quarter. Our data tracks the\nindividual teachers throughout the time period, thereby enabling us to construct\na panel data set of teacher absenteeism. We focus on absence due to reported\nillness. Teachers can take up to two weeks sick leave per year. They can\naccumulate unused sick leave in a sick bank, which is transferrable between\nschools. There is no limit on how much leave can be accumulated, but unlike\nsome school districts in the US, there are no buy-back provisions for unused sick\nleave.\nIn common with previous studies, we restrict our analysis to teachers who\n7\nwere employed throughout the two years, to remove possible bias related to the\nprobationary teaching period and those teachers in the process of leaving the\nprofession.\nTable 1 shows summary statistics of teacher\u0092s absence. The \u0085gures are mean\nvalues for the percentage of working time lost and percentage of teachers taking\nabsence. Figures for the UK from Bowers and McIver (2000) are presented for\ncomparison. It is interesting that although full-time teachers in Australia are\nmore likely to take absence, the average percentage of time lost through absence\nis similar in the UK and Australia.\nFor each teacher we have information on personal characteristics, such as age,\ngender, whether a worker has a disability, their length of tenure in the public\nsector and ethnic background; the latter is comprised of two groups, teachers\nfrom a Non-English Speaking Background (NESB) and other Australians.2 We\nalso have data on the workplace characteristics of teachers, drawn from another\nsource of school administrative data. From this we can determine the school\nthe teacher was working at, and along with occupational codes allows us to\ndistinguish between primary and secondary school teachers and the size of the\nschool.\nQueensland teachers can be employed under three types of contracts - ca-\nsual, permanent or temporary. Casual teachers are generally short-term contract\nsta\u00a4, usually \u0091relief\u0092teachers, who may enter and leave the teaching workforce on\na regular basis. Consequently, we exclude this group from our analysis. Tempo-\n2Some teachers are indigenous Australians, however they represent a very small proportion\nof the teaching workforce and provide insu\u00a2 cient observations for statistical analysis.\n8\nrary teachers are employed on \u0085xed term contracts, generally of one years length,\nwhich can be renewed, whereas permanent teachers are in e\u00a4ect tenured. Addi-\ntionally, teachers can be employed on a full-time or part-time basis. Unlike US\nschool systems where there can be considerable variation in employment terms\nand conditions across school districts (Ehrenberg et al 1986), all Queensland\nteachers operate under the same basic pay and working conditions.\nMeasures of school quality are constructed from student record data that\nrefer to all students in the Queensland state school system in 2001. For primary\nschool students we have records for all year 7 students (the \u0085nal year of primary\nschool) and matching year 5 records (for 1999). For secondary students we have\nall year 10 student records (the \u0085nal compulsory year of high school) and year\n12 records for those pupils who remain in education. The student dataset also\nprovides information on student test score performance. In our data we have\ntest scores for year 7 (with matching year 5 scores) and standardized year 12\ntest scores. The individual pupil test scores are averaged for each school to\nprovide an indicator of school quality. However, for secondary schools, year 12\ntest scores will not necessarily be an accurate representation of overall student\nquality. This is because: (a) poorer quality or less motivated students are likely\nto leave the school after the end of compulsory schooling (year 10); and (b)\nsome students may choose to move to more successful schools to complete their\nhigh school. To allow for this our measure of secondary school quality utilises\nschool retention data, which refers to the proportion of students who began at\nthe school in year 7 and also completed at the same school in year 12.\n9\nQueensland covers a large area of land and geographically remote areas have\nhigher concentrations of indigenous Australians who are, in educational and\nsocio-economic terms, generally amongst the most disadvantaged individuals\n(Bradley et al 2005). Other schools are in regional centres and then there is\nthe urban concentration of population in south east Queensland centred around\nBrisbane. As we have the postcode for each school, this enables us to identify\nurban, rural and remote schools.\nIn Table 2 we present summary statistics on variables used in the empirical\nanalysis separately for primary and secondary schools. It is clear that women\ndominate primary school teaching by a ratio of 5 to 1, whereas the gender\ndisparity is much lower in secondary school teaching. Other covariates show\nlittle variation between primary and secondary schools. Three quarters of all\nsecondary school teachers are non-specialists, the omitted case.3 Mean absen-\nteeism rates are very similar for primary and secondary school teachers. Figure\n2 displays the distribution of individual absence days. A large of proportion of\nteachers took less than 5 days absence over the 2 year period. At the same time,\nthere is a clear tail at the right hand side of the distribution.\n3The quali\u0085cations required to be a teacher in Australia di\u00a4er between primary and sec-\nondary school sectors. Secondary school teachers generally complete an undergraduate course\nfollowed by a graduate diploma in education. Conversely, primary school teaching involves an\nundergraduate course dedicated to primary school education. As a result subject specialization\nand post-graduate study information is only available for secondary school teachers\n10\n4 Theoretical and econometric framework\nTo analyse these data we draw upon the theoretical framework and econometric\nmethodology developed by Ichino and Maggi (2000) in their study of absenteeism\namongst the employees of an Italian bank. They suggest four broad determi-\nnants of individual variations in absenteeism. First, \u0091individual backgrounds\u0092,\nincluding personal characteristics, which in the present context also includes\nthe contract status of the teacher. Second, the characteristics of the school in\nwhich the teacher works and the locality in which they live, for instance, the\nsize of the school and the local unemployment rate, which are labelled \u0091locality\u0092\ne\u00a4ects. These factors are what Manski (1995) refers to as contextual e\u00a4ects,\nand exogenous changes in them have no multiplied e\u00a4ect on teacher behaviour.\nThird, teachers may be sorted between schools which have di\u00a4erent average ab-\nsenteeism rates, which is linked to a fourth in\u0087uence, that of group interaction.\nIn this case, absenteeism of an individual teacher is in\u0087uenced by the prevalence\nof that behaviour in the group (Manski 1993, Manski 1995), which gives rise\nto the idea of a social multiplier e\u00a4ect. Ichino and Maggi (2000) suggest that\nthe social multiplier could arise in the shirking context via (i) a peer monitor-\ning mechanism, that is, if more teachers shirk then an individual shirker is less\nlikely to be reported thus the penalty is lower and hence shirking is higher; (ii)\nstigma e\u00a4ects, whereby shirking represents \u0091acceptable\u0092behaviour; and (iii) if\nthe school management has limited monitoring resources then the likelihood of\nbeing caught shirking is reduced.\nIn view of these considerations, it is suggested that workers will compare\n11\nthe bene\u0085ts of shirking with the costs of shirking to maximise expected utility\n(EU), as represented by Equation 1.\nEUit = B(Ait; St; \u0012i)\u0000 C(Ait;\n_\nAt) (1)\nwhere Ait is the individual teacher\u0092s chosen level of absence in period t, St\nis a set of school and locality factors, and \u0012i represents the teacher\u0092s preference\nfor absenteeism.\n_\nAt is the average absenteeism level of the school in period\nt, excluding the ith individual.4 The marginal penalty to absenteeism is lower\nfor higher values of\n_\nAt for the reasons highlighted above. It follows that a\nteacher\u0092s propensity to absent themselves will be determined by the factors\nlisted in Equation 2.\nAit = g(\n_\nAt; St; \u0012i) (2)\nFrom the assumptions above it follows that @Ait=@\n_\nAt > 0 and @Ait=@\u0012i > 0.\nChatterji and Tilley (2002) introduce the concept of the \u0091presenter\u0092, these are\nworkers with a low preference for absenteeism. Such workers derive satisfaction\nfrom being able to maintain a presence at work, regardless of illness, or see it\nis in their own best interest to carry out their duties. The teacher\u0092s concern\nfor her class or the excess workload on colleagues, or perhaps their reputation\nwith the school management, counterbalances the decrease in utility from illness\nor stress. Moreover, extra leisure time generates no increase in utility for this\ntype of individual, and thus the presenter is likely to have a low value of \u0012. We\n4Throughout the empirical implementation t refers to a quarter.\n12\ncannot observe \u0012 directly, however, it is likely that the preference for absenteeism\nis highly correlated with the personal characteristics of the teacher. Also, for\nworkers on a temporary contract C(Ait) is likely to be higher as they face an\nincreased likelihood of contract non-renewal if their absenteeism rate is judged\nto be unsatisfactory.\nThe \u0085rst model that we estimate is therefore given by Equation 3. Initially,\nwe ignore the time dimension in our data and simply estimate a cross-sectional\nmodel.\nAi = \u000ePi + \f\n_\nA+ \rS + \u000f (3)\nPi is a vector of individual background characteristics. In a subsequent\nmodel we exploit the longitudinal nature of our data and rede\u0085ne (3) as a panel\ndata model with individual speci\u0085c \u0085xed e\u00a4ects:\nAit = \u000bi + \u000etPi + \f\n_\nAt +\nX\nd\n&jDjt + \rSt + \u000ft (4)\nwhere \u000b is an individual speci\u0085c \u0085xed e\u00a4ect, Djt is a dummy variable to cap-\nture unobserved locality e\u00a4ects where there are d localities or districts. Ideally\nthis variable would identify the school that a teacher was in at time t. However,\nas our focus is on teachers who move schools and the fact that there are insu\u00a2 -\ncient teachers who movers to identify all 1123 school \u0085xed e\u00a4ects, we therefore\nadopt a similar approach to Ichino and Maggi (2000) by including \u0085xed e\u00a4ects\nfor the 33 education districts. We argue that as education districts are rea-\nsonably homogenous with respect to pay and policies these should adequately\n13\ncapture the e\u00a4ect of time invariant local characteristics. Finally, \u000etPi is simply\na time dummy interacted with ostensibly \u0085xed individual background variables\nto control for time varying e\u00a4ects from observed individual characteristics.\nThere are two further issues that must be considered. First, because group\ninteraction e\u00a4ects are endogenous, estimates of\n_\nAt may well be biased or even\nspurious. One source of endogeneity bias is the so-called \u0091re\u0087ection problem\u0092\nwhereby average group behaviour a\u00a4ects individual behaviour but each indi-\nvidual teacher\u0092s behaviour also a\u00a4ects average behaviour, which means that\nindividual errors are correlated and hence our estimates will be biased. An-\nother source of endogeneity bias arises if relevant school covariates are omitted,\nin which case the errors for teachers in the same school will be correlated and\nthus the e\u00a4ect of\n_\nAt will again be biased. Spurious e\u00a4ects arise where teach-\ners behave in a similar way because they share a common set of unobservable\ncharacteristics which causes teachers to sort between schools.\nIn short, there is an identi\u0085cation problem, which we mitigate by investigat-\ning the e\u00a4ect of group interaction for the subset of teachers who move schools.5\nOur model for movers is given by Equation 5:\nAikt\u0000Aijt\u00001 = \f(\n_\nAkt\u0000\n_\nAjt\u00001)+\nX\nd\n(Dkt\u0000Djt\u00001)&j+\r(Skt\u0000Sjt\u00001)+\u000fkt\u0000\u000fjt\u00001\n(5)\n5Previous research has demonstrated that teachers move schools for both pecuniary and\nnon-pecuniary reasons (Hanushek et al 2004, Bonesronning et al 2005).\n14\nwhere j refers to the origin school and k the destination school; Dkt\u0000Djt\u00001\nis an indicator that a teacher moved education district. The advantage of this\napproach is that we can explicitly control for individual \u0085xed e\u00a4ects which is\nimportant if there is sorting of individuals with similar preferences for absence\nacross the school system.6\nAnalysing only those teachers who move schools does not, however, solve\nthe re\u0087ection problem completely. There still exists the possibility of several\nsources of bias, which are identi\u0085ed by Ichino and Maggi (2000). First, the\nstayers\u0092mean shirking level may be endogenous because group interaction e\u00a4ects\noccur in the direction of mover to stayer. Second,\n_\nAkt \u0000\n_\nAjt\u00001 may also be\nbiased due to unobserved locality e\u00a4ects which in\u0087uence both mover and stayer\nbehaviour. To try to remove the bias from these two sources we replace\n_\nAktwith\nits lagged value\n_\nAkt\u00001 (referred to as test 1). Third, there still remains the\npossibility of measurement error, which downwardly biases our estimate of the\ngroup interaction e\u00a4ect. An alternative approach which may reduce all three\nsources of bias is to instrument\n_\nAkt. We use\n_\nAkt\u00001 as the instrument, on the\nassumption that this will directly a\u00a4ect stayers\u0092current behaviour but not the\nmover\u0092s current behaviour (test 2). A further way of investigating the potential\nproblems of endogenous stayer behaviour and the e\u00a4ect of unobservable local\ne\u00a4ects is to investigate whether the behaviour of the stayers is a\u00a4ected by the\n6We checked whether there is seasonality in absence rates for teachers who move. There\nare variations in the timing of movement and of absence levels. More movement occurs at the\nend of the school year, however, omitting this quarter from our analysis has little e\u00a4ect on\nour results. Further absence levels do not appear to be seasonal in our data: the last quarter\nof the year, for instance, has both the highest absence rate (year 1) and the lowest absence\nrate (year 2).\n15\ndeparture of bad workers (i.e. those with high absence rates) and the arrival of\ngood workers (i.e. those with low absence rates). This involves regressing the\nchange in the mean absence rate of stayers on a set of control variables, as well\nas the mean absence rate of newly arrived teachers, which is expected to have a\npositive e\u00a4ect, and the mean absence rate of those teachers who depart, which is\nexpected to be negative.7 There still remains a potential bias, however, due to\nthe endogeneity of the mean absence rates of arriving and departing teachers,\nwhich we seek to resolve by using the lagged mean absence rate of arriving\nteachers and the lead mean absence rate of departing teachers (test 3).\n5 Results\nTables 3 and 4 report estimates of Equation 3 for primary teachers and sec-\nondary teachers, respectively. Our dependant variable is days absent during\neach quarter for each teacher. Initially we estimate Equation 3 by OLS. How-\never, the record of teacher absenteeism in our data is a count of events, therefore\nestimation using a count data approach (Poisson model) is also used for com-\nparison with the OLS estimates.\nWe report the incident rate ratio (IRR) for the Poisson model for ease of\ninterpretation. Thus, an IRR greater than one indicates that the expected count\nin the exposed group is greater than the expected count in the unexposed group.\nFor instance an IRR of 1.15 indicates a 15% increase in the absenteeism rate for\n7This is equation 7 in Ichino and Maggi (2000).\n16\nthe exposed group, whilst 0.85 indicates a 15% decrease in the rate. Since there\nis a lack of detailed econometric evidence on the determinants of absenteeism\namongst teachers, we \u0085rst discuss the impact of individual background and\nlocality factors before we move to the main focus of the paper, the estimation\nof group interaction e\u00a4ects. In these models we report estimates of the impact\nof school level absenteeism, however for the reasons noted above these estimates\nshould be treated as descriptive.\n5.1 The e\u00a4ect of personal and locality characteristics on\nabsenteeism\nThe OLS results in Tables 3 and 4 show that there is a non-linear relationship\nbetween age and absenteeism which declines quite sharply for primary and sec-\nondary teachers but with slightly di\u00a4erent turning points. For primary school\nteachers the turning point is around the age of 30 whereas for secondary school\nteachers it is age 28, after which absenteeism increases. We also estimated a\nPoisson model where the age variable was grouped into bands to investigate the\nnon-linear relationship in more detail. The \u0085ndings (not reported) show that for\nprimary and secondary school teachers there is a substantial increase in absen-\nteeism for older age groups. For instance, secondary school teachers aged 31-40\nhave a 9% increase in absenteeism rates compared to younger teachers (30 years\nor younger) whereas workers aged 61 or more have a 61% greater absenteeism\nrate, a di\u00a4erential of 52 percentage points. Similarly, the di\u00a4erential between\nprimary school teachers aged 31-40 and those aged 61 or more is 41 percent-\n17\nage points. This is consistent with the age e\u00a4ects found in aggregate evidence\n(Bridges and Mumford 2001). These \u0085ndings could be partly to do with the\ne\u00a4ect of taking accumulated leave before retirement (Ehrenberg et al 1986), or\nbecause of a gradual decline in enthusiasm for the job and hence an increase\nin absenteeism, given that we control for major health problems through the\nteacher being identi\u0085ed as disabled. There is no statistically signi\u0085cant gender\ndi\u00a4erence in the incidence of absenteeism for either primary or secondary school\nteachers. Teachers from a Non English Speaking Background have absence rates\nthat are between 8% and 11% higher. As expected, the impact of having a regis-\ntered disability on the amount of absenteeism taken is very high, 31% and 25%,\nrespectively, for primary and secondary teachers.\nThere are some interesting \u0085ndings with respect to contract status and the\nincidence of absenteeism. Workers on temporary contracts take signi\u0085cantly\n(22%-24%) fewer days of absence than their colleagues on permanent contracts,\nwhich may be indicative of a presenteeism e\u00a4ect in an attempt to secure a perma-\nnent contract (Ichino and Riphahn 2005). A further aspect of the contractual\narrangement for teachers is that some are asked to perform higher duties in\nreturn for more pay. We \u0085nd that those primary and secondary teachers under-\ntaking such duties have around 20% to 24% less absence, which indicates that\nperformance-related pay may reduce shirking. For secondary school teachers we\nnote that absenteeism varies by subject specialism.\nTurning to the locality e\u00a4ects, the e\u00a4ects of school size and the average qual-\nity of the pupil population are either statistically insigni\u0085cant or very small.\n18\nSome of the contextual e\u00a4ects are slightly larger and more signi\u0085cant, for in-\nstance, the higher the average age of the teaching body or the higher the pro-\nportion of teachers who are female in primary schools, the greater an individual\nteachers absence. We \u0085nd that teachers in remote and rural schools take less\nabsence than teachers in urban schools. This could be related to a greater com-\nmitment amongst teachers willing to take teaching posts in these localities, a\nwider sense of community involvement, or simply an inadequate supply of casual\nteachers, which means that teachers in non-urban areas are forced to present\nthemselves for work to ensure that the class is taught.8\n5.2 The e\u00a4ect of group interaction on absenteeism\nTable 5 summarises our estimates of the group interaction e\u00a4ect that are derived\nfrom pooled OLS, panel and mover models. The dependent variable is the level\nor change in individual teacher absenteeism in each quarter over two years. Ini-\ntially, we estimate pooled OLS models to provide estimates of group interaction\ne\u00a4ects without addressing the issues of unobserved heterogeneity and endogene-\nity. Column 2 presents estimates of \f obtained from a pooled OLS estimation\nof Equation 4 where the individual \u0085xed e\u00a4ects term is dropped. The intro-\nduction of individual speci\u0085c \u0085xed e\u00a4ects (column 3) has no marked e\u00a4ect on\nthe estimates. Indeed, these basic set of results suggest the presence of group\ninteraction e\u00a4ects on absenteeism behaviour are not substantially changed by\n8There is some support for this latter argument as casual teachers as a proportion of the\ntotal teacher workforce is much lower in remote areas; 50% less than in urban areas in the\ncase of primary schools and 20% less for secondary schools\n19\nthe inclusion of controls for unobserved individual level heterogeneity.\nA problem with these estimates, however, is that there is an identi\u0085cation\nproblem for the reasons discussed earlier. We therefore estimate Equation 5\nfor those teachers who move schools, with and without the dummy variables,\nDjt. In the appendix (Table A1) we present summary information on movers\nin comparison to stayers. The main di\u00a4erences are that movers are slightly\nyounger, have a shorter tenure and are more likely to be on a temporary contract.\nInter-school movement may be part of a sorting process where, for instance,\nteachers with higher absence propensities move to schools with higher average\nabsence rates. However, it was found that individuals in the highest quartile\nof the absence distribution moved to schools that had a slightly lower average\nabsenteeism than their origin school. For movers from other quartiles there\nwas no discernible change in average school absenteeism between origin and\ndestination. Hence, there does not appear to be systematic sorting across schools\nby absence propensity, at least within the 2 year time frame in which we observe\nmovement. However, we investigate below if this is true for di\u00a4erent types of\nmovers.\nColumn 4 and 5 of Table 5 provide OLS estimates of the mover models. As\nthese models are estimated for the period of movement, they provide estimates\nof the contemporaneous impact of group interaction e\u00a4ects on individual ab-\nsenteeism. For primary school teachers the e\u00a4ect of\n_\nAikt \u0000\n_\nAijt\u00001 is robust at\naround 0.07, regardless of the inclusion of the district dummy variables, whereas\nfor secondary school teachers the coe\u00a2 cient is between 0.10 and 0.12. We can\n20\ntherefore claim that a worker takes one more day of absenteeism per quarter if\nhis average coworker takes 12 more days or 8 more days absenteeism per quarter\nfor primary school and secondary school teachers, respectively. The magnitude\nof these group interaction e\u00a4ects are lower for primary school teachers and\nsimilar for secondary teachers when compared to those previously reported for\nabsenteeism in Ichino and Maggi (2000). Our results are also comparable to\nthose found in other more general research on group interaction e\u00a4ects (see for\ninstance Gaviria and Raphael (2001) and Falk and Ichino (2003)).\n5.3 Further tests\nRecall that our analysis of movers may not fully mitigate the identi\u0085cation\nproblems referred to earlier. We therefore performed a series of tests, discussed\nabove, to try to reduce the potential bias in our estimates of the group inter-\naction e\u00a4ects. The results of test 1 lead to an increase in the magnitude of the\ngroup interaction e\u00a4ect to 0.110 (s.e. = 0.026) for primary school teachers and\n0.234 (s.e. = 0.065) for secondary school teachers. These results suggest that\nour earlier estimates are downwardly biased, although the \u0085ndings for secondary\nschool teachers are higher than expected. The second test proved less conclusive\ninsofar as the estimates were statistically insigni\u0085cant, regardless of the choice of\ninstruments. This is due to problems in \u0085nding suitable instrumental variables\nin our data. For the third test the estimated e\u00a4ect of the mean absence rate\nof arriving teachers is positive and that for departing teachers is negative, as\nexpected, however, the estimates are small and statistically insigni\u0085cant. This\n21\nis not surprising as the number of movers is small relative to the number of\nstayers. It is likely, however, that the e\u00a4ect of group interaction is bigger in\nsmall schools simply because group norms are more easily and more directly\ntransmitted. To test this hypothesis we re-estimated test 3 but for schools with\nless than 30 teachers, and the estimated e\u00a4ects are considerably larger, correctly\nsigned but statistically insigni\u0085cant. These \u0085ndings are consistent with those of\nIchino and Maggi (2000).9\nUp to this point we have ignored the motivation for teachers to move school.\nThis may impact upon our estimates of group interaction e\u00a4ects insofar as\nindividuals whose absence behaviour is improving over time may move to low-\nabsence schools. If this occurs this would tend to overstate the relationship\nbetween individual and group absence behaviour and lead to an upwardly biased\nestimate of the e\u00a4ect of\n_\nAijt \u0000\n_\nAikt\u00001(Ichino and Maggi 2000). Our data does\nnot explicitly identify reasons for movement between schools. However, we\nobserve changes in a worker\u0092s job classi\u0085cation level and their wage rate, which\nmeans that we can identify those teachers who received a promotion as part\nof their school move and those who did not. Individuals who move as part of\na promotion are more likely to have improving absence behaviour over time.\nAs a result we would expect estimates of group interaction e\u00a4ects to be more\nlikely to be upwardly biased for promoted movers. We re-estimate our mover\n9An additional issue is that re\u0087ection problems are likely to be particularly severe in\nworkplaces with a smaller number of sta\u00a4. To examine whether small schools were a\u00a4ecting the\nparameter estimates of our mover models, we re-estimated these models excluding movements\nto or from small schools (5 or less teachers). This was found to not materially alter our\nestimates of group interaction e\u00a4ects.\n22\nmodel separately for the promoted and non-promoted sub-groups for primary\nand secondary school teachers, respectively. Estimates of\n_\nAkt \u0000\n_\nAjt\u00001 for the\nnon-promoted sub-group were approximately 0.064 (s.e. = 0.030) and 0.063\n(s.e. = 0.059) for primary and secondary school teachers, respectively. The\ncorresponding estimates for teachers who moved schools due to a promotion\nare 0.076 (s.e = 0.030) and 0.159 (s.e. = 0.068) for primary and secondary\nteachers, respectively. Similar to Ichino and Maggi (2000) we \u0085nd that the\nestimates of group interaction e\u00a4ects for promoted workers are higher than\nthose for other movers, and in the case of secondary school teachers these are\nstatistically di\u00a4erent. This suggests that the results in Table 5 may be slightly\nupwardly biased, especially in the case of secondary teachers. Nonetheless,\nfor primary school teachers the estimates of group interaction e\u00a4ects are still\nstatistically signi\u0085cant.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper we have sought to analyse to what extent individual teacher ab-\nsence behaviour is in\u0087uenced by group behaviour. To do this we have used a\nunique database of all primary and secondary teachers employed in the Queens-\nland public sector over a period of one year. To address problems related to\nthe identi\u0085cation of group interaction e\u00a4ects we focused on those teachers who\nmoved school during this period. Our results suggest that absenteeism is a func-\ntion of observable teacher characteristics, such as disability, contract status and\n23\nthe remoteness of the school, however, group interaction e\u00a4ects also play a sig-\nni\u0085cant role in determining individual absenteeism. Our \u0085ndings suggest that\nindividual absenteeism will increase by one day if peer group absenteeism in-\ncrease by between approximately 8 and 12 days. This is interpreted as evidence\nthat worker shirking is in\u0087uenced by workplace absence norms.\nOverall, our results support previous research which demonstrates that in-\ndividual absence behaviour is related to levels of absenteeism within the work\nunit (Ichino and Maggi 2000). This is particularly striking given that our data\ncovers a system where work policies and procedures are highly standardised.\nThus, although explicit di\u00a4erences in an organisation\u0092s policy can a\u00a4ect the\nlevel of absenteeism (Ehrenberg et al 1986), in this case variations in manage-\nment and personnel factors at the school level seem a more likely explanation.\nIt is also likely that the e\u00a4ect of group interaction re\u0087ects increased propensities\nto shirk at the individual teacher level. As a result, further research would do\nwell to consider how absenteeism, and speci\u0085cally the group-interaction e\u00a4ect,\nresponds to human resource practices, such as changes in management sta\u00a4 and\nthe manner in which absence management policies are applied. In summary, our\nresults suggest that even in large bureaucratic organisations, such as state-based\nschool systems, sta\u00a4 relationships and management style do a\u00a4ect the degree of\nteacher absence.\n24\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Education Queensland for access to their data.\nThe opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not nec-\nessarily represent the views of Education Queensland.
