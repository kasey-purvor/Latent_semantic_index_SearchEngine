V. Tikhonenko, A. A. Kozikov, A. K. Savchenko and R. V. Gorbachev\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 103, 226801 (2009) \u2013 Published November 23, 2009\nWhen an electronic device is cooled to low temper-\nature, the wavelike nature of charge carriers becomes\ndetectable through quantum interference effects. One\nexample is weak localization, a small decrease in the\nconductivity of a disordered conductor [1, 2]. Since in-\nterference depends on the quantum-mechanical phase\nof electronic waves, the experimental signature of weak\nlocalization has been used over the last thirty years to\nprobe the nature of charge carriers and disorder in nu-\nmerous conducting materials [3, 4]. A new material to\nrecently undergo such scrutiny is graphene [5], a one-\natom-thick layer of carbon atoms. It has created a huge\namount of interest, partly because electrons in it act like\nmassless neutrinos. This behavior is manifest in a range\nof observed phenomena, including the integer quantum\nHall effect [6\u20138], and it gave rise to the prediction of\nweak antilocalization in graphene [9], a small increase\nin the conductivity [2], rather than weak localization.\nSo far, however, experiments have failed to clearly see\nthis effect, reporting instead either weak localization or\na suppression of it [10\u201313]. But now, writing in Physi-\ncal Review Letters, F. V. Tikhonenko, A. A. Kozikov, A. K.\nSavchenko, and R. V. Gorbachev [14] at the University\nof Exeter, UK, demonstrate how to observe a transition\nfrom weak localization to antilocalization in graphene.\nA qualitative picture of weak localization has been de-\nveloped using Feynman\u2019s formulation of quantum me-\nchanics, in which the amplitude for propagation is given\nby a sum over classical paths, each path having its own\namplitude and phase [3, 4]. Typical classical paths con-\nnecting two points, A and B, are sketched in Fig. 1 (a) for\na two-dimensional disordered conductor. Each path fol-\nlows the random walk of an electron experiencing dif-\nfusive motion\u2014a series of straight-line segments con-\nnecting each scattering event. The scattering is elastic,\nso that the phase acquired along any given path is well\ndefined. However, for propagation from A to B, there\nare many different paths in addition to the two shown\nin Fig. 1 (a). Each has a different length and acquired\nphase, so that the sum over them involves many ran-\ndom phases. Interference between such paths averages\nto zero and electrical conductivity remains as described\nby the classical Drude model.\nInterference effects become relevant for closed paths\nbecause two electrons may start from a given point, C,\nand travel in opposite directions, as illustrated in Fig.\n1 (b). Two phases \u03d1\b and \u03d1\t acquired by the elec-\ntrons as they propagate along the closed path in a clock-\nwise and counterclockwise direction, respectively, are\nexactly equal. This results in constructive interference\nof the counterpropagating electrons when they return\nto the starting point C, which enhances the probability\nto backscatter and produces a decrease of conductivity\n[1]. Traversal of a closed loop in two directions may\nbe viewed as motion of a particle and its time-reversed\ncounterpart that traverse the path in opposite directions,\nindicating that their constructive interference is based\non time reversal symmetry. A weak magnetic field per-\npendicular to the conductor violates time reversal sym-\nmetry and suppresses weak localization. This manifests\nin experiments as a negative magnetoresistance.\nWeak localization relies on the phase coherence of\nelectrons as they travel along closed paths. Inelastic\nscattering\u2014caused by collisions with phonons or other\nelectrons, for example\u2014destroys phase information and\nsets the typical scale, the dephasing length, for sup-\npression of the interference effect. Thus contributions\nto the constructive interference only come from return\npaths that are short enough (compared to the dephasing\nlength) to remain phase coherent. Since the dephasing\nlength tends to decrease with increasing temperature,\nobservation of the effect usually requires low temper-\nature (typically, a few tens of kelvin).\nThe above picture is strongly modified in graphene\n[5] because electrons in it possess an additional spinlike\nquantum number, known as pseudospin. It appears be-\nDOI: 10.1103\/Physics.2.98\nURL: http:\/\/link.aps.org\/doi\/10.1103\/Physics.2.98\nc\u00a9 2009 American Physical Society\nPhysics 2, 98 (2009)\nFIG. 1: (a) Two classical paths connecting arbitrary points A\nand B in a two-dimensional disordered conductor. (b) A pair\nof closed paths that contribute to the weak localization cor-\nrection. (c) In a single scattering event, a long-range potential\nis unable to scatter chiral quasiparticles in the backwards di-\nrection (upper left) because it can\u2019t reverse the pseudospin di-\nrection (black arrows), whereas scattering in the forwards or\nsideways direction (lower right) is allowed [15].\ncause the honeycomb lattice consists of two triangular\nsublattices, and two components of the electronic wave\nfunction on them are analogous to the two components\nof spin 1\/2. An \u201cup\u201d pseudospin state would corre-\nspond to all the electronic density lying on one sublat-\ntice, \u201cdown\u201d to all the density on the other, but since\nthe density is shared equally between the two sublat-\ntices, the pseudospin is a linear combination of \u201cup\u201d\nand \u201cdown,\u201d and it lies in the plane of the graphene\nsheet. Furthermore, quasiparticles in graphene are chi-\nral, meaning that the orientation of the electron\u2019s pseu-\ndospin is either parallel or antiparallel to the direction\nof its momentum.\nA long-range potential, due, for example, to charges\ntrapped in the substrate, is not able to differentiate be-\ntween neighboring atoms and thus it does not affect the\npseudospin. Owing to the conservation of pseudospin,\nsuch a potential is unable to scatter chiral quasiparticles\nin the backwards direction [15], Fig. 1 (c), and this sup-\npression of backscattering is associated with weak an-\ntilocalization of electrons in graphene [9]. As electrons\npropagate around closed paths, Fig. 1 (b), the pseu-\ndospin remains parallel to the momentum. For a clock-\nwise path [blue line in Fig. 1 (b)], the pseudospin ro-\ntates by an angle of \u2212pi in the graphene plane; for an\nanticlockwise path (red line), the angle of pseudospin\nrotation is pi. The difference in the angle of rotation of\nthe pseudospin for the counterpropagating paths is then\n2pi. In analogy to the rotation of a spin-1\/2 fermion,\nfor which a rotation by 2pi doesn\u2019t return the wave\nfunction to its original state, net rotation of the pseu-\ndospin by 2pi induces a phase difference of pi between\nthe counterpropagating paths. The returning electrons\nare now out of phase. This leads to destructive inter-\nference that suppresses backscattering, producing an in-\ncrease of conductivity called weak antilocalization [2, 9].\nSuppression of antilocalization by a perpendicular mag-\nnetic field will then be seen as positive magnetoresis-\ntance.\nGraphene has two copies\u2014known as valleys\u2014of the\ngapless Dirac-like spectrum. In the absence of inter-\nvalley scattering, the interference of counterpropagating\nelectrons from the same valley is sensitive to intravalley\nsymmetry-breaking perturbations that affect the pseu-\ndospin. Counterpropagating electrons accumulate dif-\nferent phases, suppressing any (negative or positive)\nmagnetoresistance effect. Intervalley scattering, on the\nother hand, allows the counterpropagating electrons to\noccupy different valleys [16, 17]. As the two valleys\nhave opposite chirality, the phases acquired by the elec-\ntron and its time-reversed partner around a closed loop\nare equal, resulting in constructive interference and a\nrestoration of the weak localization effect [10\u201313, 16, 17].\nThe tendency of symmetry-breaking perturbations,\neither intra- or intervalley, to destroy weak antilocaliza-\ntion suggests that it shows up only in relatively clean\nsamples. Not only did Tikhonenko and coauthors [14]\nimprove sample quality, they were also able to tune the\nratio of the dephasing length to the symmetry-breaking\nlength. They did this by (a) increasing temperature to\nreduce the dephasing length and (b) employing an ap-\nplied gate voltage to decrease carrier density\u2014 thus in-\ncreasing the intervalley scattering length. In this work\nthey exploited behavior established by them in earlier\nexperiments [13].\nAt low temperature, when the dephasing length ex-\nceeds the symmetry-breaking length, weak localization\nis observed, as in previous experiments [10\u201313]. How-\never, by decreasing the ratio of the dephasing length\nto the symmetry-breaking length, it was possible to en-\nter the regime when decoherence suppresses the influ-\nence of symmetry-breaking perturbations. In this case,\nTikhonenko et al. observe positive magnetoresistance,\na clear signature of weak antilocalization arising from\nphase-coherent paths short enough to preserve the chi-\nral nature of counterpropagating electrons. Surpris-\ningly, they find that weak antilocalization persists up to\na relatively high temperature of around 200 K, owing\nto weak electron-phonon scattering in graphene, so that\nthe main source of dephasing over a broad range of tem-\nperature remains electron-electron scattering.\nThe observation of weak antilocalization in graphene\narises from a phase difference of pi acquired by counter-\npropagating chiral electrons. One does not expect this\nin bilayer graphene where the chirality of low-energy\nquasiparticles is different [8, 18]. In bilayers, pseu-\ndospin is linked to the direction of momentum, but\nDOI: 10.1103\/Physics.2.98\nURL: http:\/\/link.aps.org\/doi\/10.1103\/Physics.2.98\nc\u00a9 2009 American Physical Society\nPhysics 2, 98 (2009)\nturns twice as quickly as momentum does. The acquired\nphase difference of counterpropagating chiral electrons\nwould be a multiple of pi, resulting in weak localiza-\ntion [12, 16, 19]. So far, the story of weak localization\nin graphene involves the interplay of additional spinlike\nquantum numbers, related to lattice and valley degrees\nof freedom, but not electronic spin itself. Spin-orbit cou-\npling may be an alternative way to induce weak antilo-\ncalization in graphene and bilayer graphene, as in con-\nventional conductors [2, 3], but its observation is likely\nto be challenging in view of the predicted weakness [20]\nof the spin-orbit interaction in graphene.\nReferences\n[1] B.
