The alleged evidence for humans can\nbe easily explained as an artefact of experimental procedures that do not\ncontrol for the credibility of payment over different time horizons. In ap-\npropriately controlled and financially motivated settings, human behavior\nis consistent with conventional exponential preferences.\nAinslie\u2019s (2001) book, Breakdown of Will, is based on hyperbolic\ndiscounting theory. This theory predicts that the individual could\nbehave in a dynamically inconsistent manner, by holding and act-\ning on preferences at one point in time that contradict the pref-\nerences of the same individual at a later date. However, before\nworrying about ways that the individual could address possible dy-\nnamic inconsistencies, we need to be sure that the behavioral\npremise is valid.\nA critical design feature in the empirical literature on hyper-\nbolic discounting is the use of a time delay to the early payment\noption in order to control for any confounding effects from fixed\npremia due to transactions costs. The use of this front end delay\n(FED) means that one cannot differentiate between \u201cquasi-hy-\nperbolic preferences\u201d and \u201cexponential preferences,\u201d and we do\nnot believe that any credible design can do so.\nAinslie concludes his discussion of the empirical evidence on\nhyperbolic discounting with the following passage:\nThere is extensive evidence that both people and lower animals spon-\ntaneously value future vents in inverse proportion to their expected de-\nlays. The resulting hyperbolic discount curve is seen over all time\nranges, from seconds to decades. Because a hyperbolic curve is more\nbowed than the exponential curve that most utility theories go by, it de-\nscribes a preference pattern that these theories would call irrational: It\npredicts temporary preferences for the poorer but earlier of the two al-\nternative goals during the time right before the poorer alternative be-\ncomes available. (Ainslie 2001, p. 47)\nThis passage confounds three things. The first is whether the dis-\ncount rate varies with the length of the time horizon over which it\nis being elicited, such as it does with continuously hyperbolic pref-\nerences. The second is whether the discount rate for a given hori-\nzon and elicited with a FED is different than the discount rate for\nthe same horizon and elicited with no FED. For an experimenter,\nand for subjects evaluating the credibility of being paid, these are\nvery different questions. The potential importance of this distinc-\ntion seems to have been first noticed by Benzion et al. (1989).1 It\nwas also highlighted by Roberts (1991, p. 344), in the context of\ncomments on Ainslie and Haendel (1983) and Winston and Wood-\nbury (1991). The third issue is whether nonexponential prefer-\nences imply dynamic inconsistency when one relaxes the restric-\ntive assumption of temporally separable preferences (Machina\n1989; McClennan 1990).\nThe FED design was introduced into discount rate experiments\nto address concerns about differential credibility. Although it may\nnot completely solve the potential credibility problem, it arguably\nmitigates it. The FED also serves to equalize any other unspeci-\nfied differences subjects may perceive between the two payment\noptions. For example, if subjects have a \u201cpassion for the present,\u201d\nthey demand a premium in order to accept a delay of any length.\nIn a choice between immediate payment and delayed payment,\nthis premium is attached only to the delayed payment. Thus, the\nsubject is being asked to compare \u201cgood apples today\u201d with \u201cbad\napples tomorrow,\u201d confounding the discount rate with the credi-\nbility of receiving the commodity. However, if both payments are\ndelayed, the premium applies to both choices and thus becomes\nirrelevant to a choice between them. Harrison et al. (2002) used a\nFED in a major field experiment in Denmark, and found that\nelicited discount rates are proximately invariant with respect to\nhorizon.\nThere are, however, many field settings in which the relevant\nissue is what the discount rate is for \u201cmoney today\u201d versus \u201cmoney\nin the future.\u201d2 Even if the experimenter faces the inferential\nproblem of having to then tease apart the effects of time horizon\nfrom credibility, transactions, or other subjective costs, it is en-\ntirely appropriate that experiments with no FED be considered.\nIf there is a finding that discount rates are not constant when there\nis no FED, then it is a matter for interpretation as to whether this\nis a subjective differential cost effect or a time-inconsistency ef-\nfect (or both).\nEvidence for the behavioral importance of a 30-day FED was\nprovided by Coller and Williams (1999). In one of their experi-\nmental treatments they had no such delay, and the results from\nthose experiments can be directly compared to their other exper-\niments. After some minor modifications to their statistical analy-\nsis, Coller and Williams\u2019s results provide evidence that the use of\na FED decreases elicited rates by a large amount. The average ef-\nfect of having no FED is to increase elicited rates by 28 percent-\nage points, with a 95% confidence interval between 52 percent-\nage points and 3 percentage points. Coller et al. (2003) provide\nadditional laboratory evidence on the role of the FED, and show\nthat a 7-day FED is sufficient to overcome the effects of subjec-\ntive transactions costs.\nFinally, there have been no direct tests of the implication of dy-\nnamically inconsistent choice behavior using real rewards. Such\nlongitudinal tests require that one allow for possible changes in\nthe states of nature that the subject faces, since they may confound\nany in-sample comparisons of discount rate functions at different\npoints in time. Harrison et al. (2005) have reported the results of\na large-scale panel experiment undertaken in the field to examine\nthis issue and found evidence strikingly consistent with dynamic\nconsistency.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe thank the Danish Social Science Research Council for research sup-\nport under project No. 24-02-0124.\nNOTES\n1. Holcomb and Nelson (1992) reexamined the role of a FED with\nmonetary payoffs, motivated by a concern that Benzion et al. (1989) only\nstudied hypothetical choices. Their FED was only one day long, so it is not\nobvious that the subjects viewed this as substantially different from there\nbeing no FED. They observed no apparent effect of the one-day FED on\nbehavior.\n2. Such settings might include individual decisions of whether to con-\nsume now or save for future consumption, or to purchase a more expen-\nsive but energy efficient appliance. We believe that individual decisions in-\nvolving more significant sums of money or public policy decisions are\nbetter characterized as having a FED.\nShaping your past selves\nJeanne Peijnenburg\nFaculty of Philosophy, University of Groningen, 9712 GL Groningen, The\nNetherlands. Jeanne.Peijnenburg@rug.nl\nAbstract: I propose to complement Ainslie\u2019s idea of \u201cbargaining with your\nfuture selves\u201d with that of \u201cshaping your past selves.\u201d The result of such a\ncomplementation is that an action can work in two ways: (1) as a prede-\ncent for future behavior and (2) as a shaper of past behavior. I argue that\nthis diminishes the unwanted effects of hyperbolic discounting even fur-\nther.\nWeakness of will, or akrasia, comes in two different forms.
