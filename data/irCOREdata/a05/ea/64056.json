Introduction 41 \n 42 \nIn the enthusiasm that surrounds exciting and novel science it is easy to forget that a 43 \nunified approach to data management aimed to ensure consistency in data quality, ease of 44 \ndissemination between collaborators, secure archiving and future utilisation of the data is 45 \ncritical to the success of projects (Lowry et al., 2005). This is particularly true of major multi-46 \ndisciplinary and multi-partner programmes. Collection of marine data involves expensive 47 \nplatform operations, such as running research vessels and training of qualified personnel. In 48 \naddition, because of the inherent difficulties in their collection marine measurements are 49 \nirreplaceable assets that are both expensive to collect and uniquely document the changing 50 \nearth system.   51 \n Over the past two decades the scientific community has become increasingly aware of 52 \nthe importance of time series measurements as baselines for the quantification of changes in 53 \nthe marine environment (Beaugrand, 2002). It is essential that future generations of scientists 54 \nand research users are able to access environmental data that has been properly managed and 55 \npreserved, to known standards and formats, together with basic background information on 56 \nhow the data were collected and analysed (metadata). Scientists and funding bodies have also a 57 \nlegal and moral responsibility to make the data and results from publicly funded activities 58 \nwidely available. Moreover, insurance is required against accidental loss and technological 59 \nredundancy through changes in storage media. Delivering all this requires a dedicated 60 \ninfrastructure of complex relational databases and staff that understand the data and their use as 61 \nwell as information technology.  62 \nThe scarcity and high value of oceanographic data has led increasingly to the 63 \ndevelopment of a culture where long-term data curation and data sharing, through specialised 64 \nnational data centres, has become the norm rather than the exception (Glover et al 2006, Seys 65 \net al 2006). Since its creation in 1979 the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) has 66 \nprovided support to the UK marine science through its data management activities, by 67 \ndelivering fully integrated and quality controlled data for future utilisation by research 68 \nscientists, the government, industry as well as the wider public. BODC deals with biological, 69 \nchemical, physical, and geophysical data and its databases contain measurements of nearly 70 \n15,000 different variables. Its staff includes data scientists from a wide range of scientific 71 \ndisciplines who have direct experience of marine data collection and analysis working 72 \nalongside information technology specialists developing and maintaining the databases and 73 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  3\nsoftware infrastructure required to support data management and data distribution systems. One 74 \nof the key responsibilities of National data centres such as BODC is to provide data 75 \nmanagement support for the scientific activities of complex multidisciplinary long term 76 \nresearch programmes. In the present paper we discuss our experience in managing the data 77 \narising from the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) project and provide some guiding 78 \nprinciples for the data management of large multi-disciplinary programmes.  79 \n 80 \n2. Overview of the AMT data set 81 \n 82 \nBetween 1995 and 2005 AMT has undertaken 18 cruises essentially twice yearly 83 \nbetween the UK and the southern Atlantic Ocean which involved 46 international research 84 \ngroups (Table 1; Robinson, et al., 2006). The programme was divided into two phases (i.e. 85 \nphase I and phase II), separated by two years during which there was no fieldwork.   86 \nThe scientific aims of phase I were to assess mesoscale to basin scale phytoplankton 87 \nprocesses, the functional interpretation of bio-optical signatures and the seasonal, regional and 88 \nlatitudinal variations in mesozooplankton dynamics. During phase II, the program was 89 \nbroadened (Figure 1 and Robinson et al., 2006) to address a suite of cross-disciplinary 90 \nquestions concerning ocean plankton ecology and biogeochemistry and their links to 91 \natmospheric processes. Broadly, the measurements comprised hydrographic and bio-optical 92 \nproperties, biogeochemistry, aerosol and rainwater composition, plankton community structure 93 \nand plankton physiology, as summarised in Robinson et al. (2006) and Figure 1.  94 \nThe objectives included the determination of how 1) the structure, functional properties 95 \nand trophic status of the major planktonic ecosystems vary in space and time; 2) physical 96 \nprocesses control the rates of nutrient supply, including dissolved organic matter, to the 97 \nplanktonic ecosystem and 3) atmosphere-ocean exchange and photodegradation influence the 98 \nformation and fate of organic matter. Determinands include temperature, salinity, inorganic 99 \nnutrients, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrous oxide, methane, dimethylsulphide, dissolved and 100 \nparticulate carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll, phytoplankton pigments and 101 \ntaxonomy, photosynthesis, respiration, new production, nitrogen fixation, calcification, 102 \nbacterial and microzooplankton abundance and activity, microbial molecular diversity, viral 103 \nactivity, mesozooplankton community structure and physiology (i.e. respiration, copepod egg 104 \nproduction rates), atmospheric dust deposition and characterisation, bio-optical properties, and 105 \ncoloured dissolved organic matter (Table 2). An \u201cindividual dataset\u201d or \u201cAMT dataset\u201d in the 106 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  4\ncontext of this paper is a single or multiple sets of related measurements originating from a 107 \nsingle or a team of data originators during a given AMT cruise. 108 \n 109 \n3. Challenges posed by the AMT dataset management: phase I and phase II 110 \n 111 \nThe two phases of the AMT project presented BODC with very different challenges. 112 \nWhen the formal data management began at the beginning of phase II in 2002 our database 113 \nsystem was already designed to deal with the complexity of biological and biogeochemical 114 \nmeasurements. However, the number of individual sources of data, the size of the AMT 115 \ncommunity, each successive cruise often having new scientists and students and the available 116 \nfunding all presented significant challenges for the successful management of the data. The 117 \nrelative importance of these factors varied for each phase.  118 \n 119 \n3.1 Phase I 120 \nAs no provision had been made for data management during phase I, BODC and the 121 \nAMT community were essentially involved in a data rescue effort. First additional funding was 122 \nsecured. As a large number of individuals (including temporary staff & PhD students) had been 123 \ninvolved in collection, the data were in a varied state of repair. Consequently, the data had been 124 \nkept in assorted formats on a range of media, there were no authoritative protocols for 125 \ncollection and often there was no definitive version of data sets. Thus, there was considerable 126 \npotential for: data loss; confusion during analysis and subsequent interpretation; and wasted 127 \neffort tracking down and re-processing data. The process of acquiring these data was helped 128 \nconsiderably as the benefits of a central data management effort were realised during phase II 129 \nand by the realisation of AMT participants that data from phase I were not readily available. 130 \n 131 \n3.2 Phase II 132 \nPhase II presented the opportunity to undertake a more formal and structured approach 133 \nto the data management. Initially, many scientists were unaccustomed to a culture of integrated 134 \ndata management. Whilst BODC had pioneered such an approach during the NERC North Sea 135 \nprogramme in the early 1980\u2019s (Lowry et al., 2005) and later during other NERC and European 136 \nprojects, a period of organisational upheaval in UK marine science during the late 1990\u2019s 137 \nmeant that a number of the guiding principles had to be re-learned. Previously, it had often 138 \nbeen the practice that BODC data scientists would accompany cruises to provide direct support 139 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  5\non fundamental on-board data management activities (e.g. CTD and underway data 140 \nprocessing). Regrettably, space constraints precluded BODC personnel participation during 141 \nAMT cruises. This situation led to the development and implementation of a more formalised 142 \nstrategy for cruise preparation. This included the writing up of guideline documents of what 143 \nwas expected at the end of a cruise with regards to data and ancillary information associated 144 \nwith CTD and underway continuous measurements and also individual scientist data. 145 \nAdditionally, there was insufficient continuity in shipboard personnel to ensure consistent 146 \ncalibration and quality of the CTD and underway data. Consequently, it proved most efficient 147 \nfor BODC to undertake these tasks for which further resource had to be found. Figure 2 148 \nillustrates the disparity between the initial estimate of effort required for the data management 149 \nand that actually expended. 150 \n 151 \n4. How are the data managed by BODC? 152 \n 153 \n4.1 BODC communication and networking culture 154 \n 155 \nBODC\u2019s philosophy is that communication lays the foundations to good data 156 \nmanagement. Data management begins with the exchange of information between the different 157 \nparties involved in the project (i.e. BODC staff\/AMT data manager, scientists and ship 158 \npersonnel) at the planning stage and throughout the fieldwork. Whilst space constraints 159 \nprevented data scientists from participating on AMT cruises, BODC participated in the AMT 160 \nplanning and science meetings, preparation of newsletter and contributed to reports. As 161 \nmentioned previously, a number of what should have been standard working practices had to 162 \nbe re-learned to attain the processes described below. 163 \n 164 \n4.2 Initial acquisition of cruise data in liaison with the ship technical personnel & the PI 165 \n 166 \nBefore the starts of each cruise BODC liaise closely with the ship\u2019s technical personnel 167 \nbased at the National Marine Facility and the Principal Investigator (PI). This enables data 168 \nscientists to understand the scope of data collection activities and the nature of equipment 169 \ndeployed, but also enables BODC to provide a set of guidelines to assist in good data 170 \nmanagement practices and the recording of the metadata necessary for the accurate future 171 \ndescription of the data. Following the cruise, the PI is required to compile a comprehensive list 172 \nof the data collected during the cruise into the Cruise Summary Report (CSR, formerly the 173 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  6\n\u201cROSCOP\u201d) conceived by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC)  in the 174 \nlate 1960s to provide a low level inventory for tracking oceanographic data collected on 175 \nResearch Vessels.  It is expected that the PI submits the CSR, within a week of the cruise and a 176 \nfull \u201cCruise Report\u201d collating the cruise narrative and a description of the methodology of the 177 \ndata sets collected by the scientists on board, within 6 month from the end of a cruise. These 178 \ndocuments provide the key information outlining the nature of the data collected and the 179 \ntechniques employed. Alongside this, an electronic version of the CTD and underway 180 \nnavigation data is submitted with the appropriate documentation relating to the calibration and 181 \nconfiguration of the scientific instrumentation employed. 182 \n 183 \n4.3 Data tracking and banking 184 \n 185 \nThe initial source of information collated by the PI at the end of the AMT cruise is 186 \nrecorded by BODC into a series of inventory tables, one for each data set collected, together 187 \nwith the details of the scientist responsible for the data. The inventory tables are interfaced with 188 \nthe Oracle database to display the AMT data holdings dynamically on the BODC website 189 \n(http:\/\/www.bodc.ac.uk\/projects\/uk\/amt\/data_inventories\/). The records contained in the 190 \ninventory tables are continuously updated following dialogue with data originators and used to 191 \nkeep the AMT participants informed about the availability and the processing status of the 192 \ndata.  193 \n 194 \n4.3.1 Physical security 195 \nClearly, physical security of data is one of BODC\u2019s primary concerns and the 196 \norganisation\u2019s approach to this has two components: an \u2018accession system\u2019 and an \u2018archive 197 \nsystem\u2019 for long-term preservation of the data. When the data arrive at BODC they are 198 \nrecorded on an electronic accession table and the data copied into the inventory via the Unix 199 \noperating system. The physical integrity of the data is secured by preservation of the original 200 \nmedia together with a copy placed in the BODC data archive and wherever possible, an 201 \nadditional version of the data supplied is saved into ASCII format. The archive system is 202 \nsupported by an accession system containing the metadata record which provide the data 203 \nsubmission with a unique identifier and describe its contents and provenance.  204 \n 205 \n 206 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  7\n4.3.2 Data reformatting and standardisation 207 \n 208 \nMarine data sets cover an unusually wide range of physical, chemical, biological and 209 \ngeological data types. Even a single water sample may be analysed for several hundred 210 \nparameters. Often, scientists use different words to describe the same type of data. All this 211 \nmeans that there can be confusion when seeking data, which may cause errors in reports or 212 \nmisunderstandings between parties. Many organisations also want to be able to provide, search 213 \nand manipulate data over the internet. To be able to integrate these data into a database and be 214 \nable to use them reliably there must be no uncertainty surrounding the terms that are used to 215 \ndescribe data. Therefore, standardisation of the file format and the parameter defining the data 216 \nis essential for their professional management. 217 \n 218 \n4.3.2.1 The BODC file format 219 \n  CTD and underway data are reformatted into the QXF format which is a BODC defined 220 \nsubset of the binary format netCDF. Other data sets relative to discrete measurements are 221 \nhandled in ASCII format prior to loading into a relational database under the Oracle Relational 222 \nDatabase Management system. Additionally, each of the data maintained by BODC is held in 223 \nstandard units and it is assigned a parameter code described by the Parameter Dictionary 224 \n(http:\/\/www.bodc.ac.uk\/projects\/uk\/enpardis\/). 225 \n 226 \n4.3.2.2 The Parameter Dictionary 227 \nTo solve the problem of terminology standardization we have established a dictionary 228 \nof terms which maps directly to dictionaries used by other leading international data 229 \nmanagement organizations. Containing more than 18,000 terms, the parameter dictionary 230 \ndeveloped by BODC (http:\/\/www.bodc.ac.uk\/projects\/uk\/enpardis\/) is a powerful data mark-up 231 \ntool which uses a single 8-bytes parameter code to associate a data value to its parameter name 232 \nand methodology through a semantic model. The names of biological entities in the parameter 233 \ndictionary have been also standardised against the Integrated Taxonomic Information System 234 \n(ITIS) that further enriches the metadata through access to a biological taxonomy.  235 \n 236 \n4.3.3 Data Quality control 237 \n 238 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  8\nAfter reformatting and attributing parameter codes, the quality control of many 239 \noceanographic data sets is operated through data visualisation. The two main approaches to 240 \ndata quality control are either via screening using bespoke soft-wares or simply via direct 241 \nvisualisation of the data by experienced data scientists:   242 \n 243 \n4.3.3.1 EDSERPLO: the BODC way forward to CTD profile and time series data 244 \nscreening 245 \nEdserplo (Editing and SERies PLOtting) is the soft-ware developed by BODC for 246 \nscreening 1- and 2-dimensions continuous data series including continuous underway and CTD 247 \nprofile data. This software can be used to visualise multiple parameters and series and it has a 248 \nquick editing tool which allows the quality control of data through the flagging spikes and 249 \nsuspect data points (Fig 3). Since 2006 EDSERPLO runs on PC computers compared to a 250 \nprevious version, operating on Silicon Graphic stations, allowing a more efficient and faster 251 \nprocessing of the data. 252 \n 253 \n4.3.3.2 Quality control of non continuous profiles or time series data 254 \nDiscrete data measurements measured, for instance, from CTD cast bottles, net hauls or 255 \nduring experiments are also quality controlled through direct visualisation of data points on 256 \nspreadsheets and graphical plots of the data. After the data are screened, quality controlled and 257 \nreformatted they become integrated in the databases. 258 \n 259 \n4.4 Integration of AMT data in the databases 260 \n 261 \nOnce reformatted and quality controlled, all the data collected during AMT cruises 262 \nwhich originates from discrete water column sampling, continuous profilers, tows or benthic 263 \nsampling, are managed within the BODC databases where they are fully integrated with 264 \nconcomitant oceanographic measurements and associated metadata. The data are stored into 265 \nthe BODC databases into a series of tables linked to each other to various degree of complexity 266 \nto minimise duplication of information. Figure 4 shows a simplified representation of the 267 \nBODC databases within the 3 main groups of tables; 268 \n 269 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  9\n\u2022 The sampling metadata tables consisting of the sampling activity or event 270 \ndescription table with links to the fieldwork description table and to the sampling 271 \ngear code table.  272 \n 273 \n\u2022 The data tables consisting of a series of linkage and data storage tables for each 274 \nmain type of sampling or data collection techniques. 275 \n 276 \n\u2022 The parameter dictionary tables defining the 8-byte parameter codes 277 \n 278 \nAll data storage tables have the same field structure consisting of a unique key linking 279 \neach record to the linkage tables, a data parameter code, a data value, a data quality control 280 \nflag, a data originator code and a loading date. The data linkage tables invariably control the 281 \none-to-many relationship between the events and the data. Their structure has been adapted 282 \ndifferently for each main type of sampling or data collection technique in order to incorporate 283 \nspecific metadata information such as for example bottle depth and bottle type for water 284 \ncollection events, plankton net depth range, mesh size, mouth area  for plankton net hauls. The 285 \nstructure of the database is such that it may be easily expanded to include new sampling gear, 286 \nnew methodologies and instrumentation, and new parameters. 287 \n 288 \n5. AMT data policy and data dissemination 289 \n 290 \nThe distribution of the AMT data is regulated by the data policy 291 \n(http:\/\/www.bodc.ac.uk\/projects\/uk\/amt\/data_policy\/) drawn up by the AMT Scientific 292 \nSteering Committee (SSC). The policy was developed to ensure an appropriate balance 293 \nbetween the protection of data originators' intellectual property rights and the potential benefits 294 \nthat may arise via data use by the programme, the wider research community and other 295 \ninterested parties. According to this policy, when AMT data are transferred to BODC they 296 \nbecome available to other investigators within the AMT programme on the condition that the 297 \noriginator is kept informed about how the data are being used and he\/she is acknowledged in 298 \nany exploitation of that data. The AMT data can also be made available to the wider scientific 299 \ncommunity, immediately upon permission being granted by the data originator and the 300 \nsignature of a licence or after 6 months from the end of the program in April 2006. 301 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  10\nBODC supplies the AMT data to both internal and external users either directly via 302 \nemail, the ftp system or in the case of the CTD and underway data, via automatic download 303 \nthrough the BODC website (http:\/\/www.bodc.ac.uk\/data\/online_delivery\/amt\/). Before any of 304 \nthe AMT data can be downloaded, however, users are required to be registered as BODC web 305 \nusers. The data are supplied in a fixed ASCII (CSV) format and they are associated with 306 \ndocumentation providing information about sensors, quality control, calibrations and 307 \nprocessing status. Each time modifications to data are made by BODC, these files are updated 308 \nand changes are noted in the documentation. 309 \n 310 \n6. AMT data requests 311 \n 312 \nRequests for AMT data can be made directly to the BODC staff for all data or via the 313 \nBODC website for CTD and underway data. Data requests and queries made directly to BODC 314 \nare handled by either the AMT data manager or the BODC requests officer. Data requests and 315 \nthe processing of data sets required by PhD students are given priority over all other requests. 316 \nWhen data are lodged at BODC, it is the aim that requests be serviced within 1 to 3 working 317 \ndays. Currently only the CTD and underway cruise data can be downloaded from the BODC 318 \nwebsite whereas discrete data sets can only be obtained contacting the BODC staff. However, 319 \nBODC is developing a system for online delivery of its data holding and AMT data will 320 \nbecome available alongside all other publicly available data held in its databases. 321 \nStatistical information on AMT data request is only available from 2002. Since then 322 \n570 requests for AMT data have been handled (Fig. 5). Figure 5 also shows that data requests 323 \nhave steadily increased from 16 in 2002 to190 in 2005. This increase in data requests reflects 324 \nboth the expansion of the scientific community to approximately 180 scientists from 11 325 \ncountries and the provision of an on-line system for the automatic download of the CTD 326 \nprofiles and the underway data. On the other hand, the slight decrease in 2006 is probably the 327 \nresults of the conclusion of the phase II of the program and the graduation of many of the 328 \n\u201cAMT PhD students\u201d (who accounted for a significant proportion of the data requests). Since 329 \n2003 (i.e. after the introduction of the BODC web data delivery system) the proportion of data 330 \nrequests from the web has represented between 47% and 50% of total requests. Interestingly, 331 \nhowever, although the number of AMT requests received from external users has also 332 \nincreased, their proportion has remained overall stable over time at around 20 % of the total 333 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  11\nAMT requests (Fig 5). The largest data request was received from USA scientists followed by 334 \nthat of the UK and French scientific community (Figure 6). 335 \n 336 \n7. Discussion and conclusions 337 \n 338 \nThe planning and implementation of research and the efficient management of the 339 \nresulting data often appear to be two widely separate worlds. This is because, whereas data 340 \nmanagers consider data collection, management and dissemination as essential for the effective 341 \nuse of research funds, many researchers consider data management as technical and secondary 342 \nto publications. As a consequence data management is often insufficiently planned or not 343 \nplanned at all (Seys et al 2006). Perhaps, the realisation by the scientific community, in the 344 \n1990s, of the importance of long term time series to predict the impact of future changes in the 345 \nearth system on human activities together with the need to handle increasingly large and 346 \ncomplex data sets, has resulted in a change in attitude towards the role of marine data 347 \nmanagement.  348 \nA long-term multi-disciplinary international programs such as AMT provide numerous 349 \nchallenges for the managements of the data they produce in terms of their large volume, 350 \ndiversity of measurements, changes in sampling instrumentation and increased sophistication 351 \nof analytical methods. Increase in diversity and number of variables measured also means 352 \nincreasing demand and needs from the end users for their rational integration. Measurements 353 \nalso need to be supported by a rich metadata if they are to have value for the future. Clearly, 354 \nwhen it comes to satisfying the requirements of modern science on the delivery of fully 355 \nintegrated and quality controlled complex data sets, such challenge cannot longer simply be 356 \nmet by individuals or single scientific organisations without large investment of time and 357 \nresources. BODC through its support to multidisciplinary programs has specialised in handling 358 \ndata sets which are small in volume, but extremely high in complexity covering a wide range 359 \nof physical, chemical, biological, atmospheric and geological parameters. Progresses in the 360 \nacquisition and management of AMT data were facilitated by a culture of communication and 361 \ncollaboration between the data scientists and IT specialists with the AMT scientists and ship 362 \ntechnical staff. Thanks to this collaboration, BODC has rescued > 90 % of the data collected 363 \nduring the phase I of the project by scientists who have moved on in their careers often loosing 364 \ncontact with the AMT community. 365 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  12\nWithin modern data management, the role of a National Data Centres such is also 366 \nevolving from one of data repository to one of active data delivery and redistribution between 367 \nscientific partner organisations. Such evolution is being fostered and made possible thank to 368 \nconcomitant technological advances in IT soft-wares and the advent of the internet. Although 369 \nconsiderable effort has been spent by BODC to ensure the physical security of all data 370 \naccessed, its primary mission is to guarantee that data may be reused with confidence and 371 \nwithout any need for recourse to the data originator no matter how much time has elapsed since 372 \nthe data were submitted. Ensuring this forms the bulk of the work of BODC\u2019s data scientists. 373 \nThus, another important role played by BODC for the AMT community, and for other large 374 \nmultidisciplinary programs, has been in its ability to manage and disseminate data of 375 \nincreasing complexity through the development of bespoke software and web-portals. The 376 \ndevelopment of the BODC Parameter Dictionary and of screening soft-wares like EDSERPLO, 377 \nhas greatly contributed to the effective data management and dissemination of data. BODC 378 \ndata scientists also use sophisticated software, to extract quickly and efficiently integrated data 379 \nsets from the databases to satisfy data requests. In addition, the on-line data distribution system 380 \nhas introduced by BODC since 2003 via its website has also allowed the expansion and 381 \nefficient data delivery within and beyond the AMT community. 382 \nFinally, it is important to note that the funding initially allocated for the data 383 \nmanagement of AMT represented considerably less than the minimum required to manage the 384 \ndata of a large multidisciplinary program as estimated by Glover et al., (2006). In their review 385 \nof the data management of the US JGOFS project, they recommended that good data 386 \nmanagement requires devoted resources to be between 5 - 10 % of the total cost of the 387 \nprogramme. Overall, the AMT program received funding by NERC of the order of \u00a32.38 388 \nmillions of which \u00a362k (2.6%) was initially allocated for data management. In the final 389 \nanalysis an additional \u00a3140k has been sourced, meaning the total cost of the AMT data 390 \nmanagement will exceed 8.5% of the total funding.  391 \n 392 \n8. Lessons learnt and recommendations for managing future long term programs  393 \n 394 \nThe following recommendations can be drawn from the experience acquired by BODC 395 \nthrough the data management of a large multidisciplinary program such as AMT: 396 \n 397 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  13\n\u2022 At the beginning: The data center should be involved at the planning stage of any 398 \nscientific program to ensure that data management can be properly planned and 399 \nresourced. 400 \n 401 \n\u2022 A sound data policy: A comprehensive data policy must be drawn at the start to enable 402 \nthe steady and harmonious integration of the data into the database and their subsequent 403 \ndissemination in relation the protection of the intellectual property rights of the data 404 \noriginator. 405 \n 406 \n\u2022 Early contact with PIs: An early data management liaison with the project PIs 407 \nimproves data quality and the identification and logging of the information in a data 408 \ninventory.  409 \n 410 \n\u2022 A good cruise report: The preparation of a detailed and comprehensive cruise report 411 \nby the cruise Principal Scientist in collaboration with the technical ship personnel is key 412 \nto the subsequent management of the data collected during the cruise    413 \n 414 \n\u2022 Proactive sea-going support: The activity undertaken by the ship technical personnel 415 \nin monitoring the functioning of the underway ship sensors and during CTD operation 416 \nalso represents a crucial step towards gathering high quality data and support for 417 \nsuccessful data management.  418 \n 419 \n\u2022 Early data acquisition: To prevent\/minimise the risk of their loss, data and metadata 420 \nshould be acquired by the data centre as early as possible, from the time of their 421 \ncollection. This is particularly important when data processing and delivery is handled 422 \nby staff on short term contract and students. 423 \n 424 \n\u2022 Data management culture: Close collaboration with project participants including 425 \nattendance at planning and science meetings, and where possible data scientists 426 \nparticipating on cruises helps foster a culture of rigorous Data management.  427 \n 428 \nAMT Data Management & Dissemination, DSRII AMT special Issue  14\n\u2022 Data centralization: Centralisation of the data sets collected during the scientific 429 \nprogram through their submission to the data centre also prevents confusion that may 430 \narise through the dissemination of multiple versions of the same data sets by different 431 \nparties. 432 \n 433 \n 434 \nReferences 435 \n 436 \nAtlantic Meridional Transect, NERC Consortium programme (2005) 2004\/05 Review of the NERC Funded 437 \nMarine Sector Consortium Programmes.
