Compari-\nson of gas- and condensed-phase behavior provides\ninformation on solvation effects. While most applica-\ntions of MS to supramolecular assemblies focus on soft\nionization techniques, e.g., coldspray [2] and desorption\nelectrospray ionization (DESI) [3], to retain the assem-\nbly intact, structural information can be gained by\ntandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) in which precur-\nsor ions are characterized according to their fragment\nions. It is also possible to obtain information regarding\nfundamental reactivity by MS\/MS. To date, MS\/MS\ntechniques applied to supramolecular chemistry in-\nclude collision-induced dissociation (CID) to obtain\nstructural information [4], infrared multiphoton disso-\nciation (IRMPD) for the study of reactivity and mecha-\nnisms of fragmentation in the gas phase [5\u20137], and\nblackbody infrared radiation dissociation (BIRD) for the\nstudy of gas-phase kinetics [8].\nHere, we have applied electron capture dissociation\n(ECD) to the study of metallo-supramolecular double-\nand triple-stranded helicates.

(The requirement for trapped\nions and electrons means that ECD is generally only\nperformed in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron reso-\nnance (FT-ICR) [12] mass spectrometer). As with other\nrecent technological advances in mass spectrometry, the\ndevelopment of ECD has been driven by its application\nto biosciences, particularly in the analysis of peptides\nand proteins, although the technique has recently been\napplied to some synthetic macromolecules, such as\npolymers and dendrimers [13\u201319]. The ECD of metal-\nbound peptide [20\u201323] and lipid complexes [24], mag-\nnesium ammonia complexes [25], and lanthanide com-\nplexes [26] have also been studied.\nThe metallo-supramolecular triple helicates studied\nherein self-assemble in solution via coordination of the\nligands shown in Figure 1 to octahedral metal ions [27],\nin this case FeII. Coordination to the metal center causes\ntwisting along the ligand strand (e.g., between the\nphenylene rings and the adjacent pyridylimine units)\nand three ligand strands wrap about two metal ions\ngiving rise to a triple helical structure. In addition to the\nmetal\u2013ligand interactions, which drive the formation,\nthe structure is stabilized via interstrand face-edge\n\u0001-stacking interactions between the phenylene rings of\nthe spacer groups. If the ligands are reacted with\ntetrahedral metal ions, such as CuI and AgI, dinuclear\ndouble-stranded cations [M2L2]\n2\u0001 are produced [28, 29].\nThese dinuclear double-stranded species exists in two\nPublished online November 6, 2009\nr Inc.

These double- and triple-stranded arrays\nare not only representative of a wide class of metallo-\nsupramolecular species but also provide rare examples\nof functional supramolecular species, showing unique\nand unprecedented DNA recognition properties [30\u201332].\nWe demonstrate that ECD by metallo-complexes\nmay allow access in the gas phase to oxidation states\nand coordination chemistry that cannot be accessed in\nsolution. Electron capture by the di-iron(II) triple heli-\ncate ions produces dinuclear double-stranded complexes\nanalogous to those seen in solution with the monocationic\nmetal centers CuI or AgI.

Also observed in this mass spectrum are peaks\ncorresponding to [FenL2(L2 \u0004 C7H6N2)]\n\u0001\u2022 (n \u0005 1, 2).\nAs a result of the central oxygen in the ligand\nbackbone, cleavage within ligand L3 is more complex,\nsee Scheme 2. Evidence for cleavage analogous to that\nshown in Scheme 1 arises through the presence of peaks\ncorresponding to [FenL3(L3\u0004C6H4N2)]\n\u0001\u2022 (n\u0005 1, 2). In this\ncase, the cleavage does not involve hydrogen atom rear-\nrangement, possibly resulting in the nitrile pyridine. Peaks\ncorresponding to [Fe2L3(L3 \u0004 C12H9N2O)]\n\u0001\u2022, [Fe2L3(L3 \u0004\nC12H9N2)]\n\u0001\u2022, and [FeL3(L3 \u0004 C12H10N2O)]\n\u0001\u2022ions are the\nresult of cleavage of the aryl ether bond. Interestingly,\nthe di-iron products do not involve hydrogen atom\nrearrangement within the ligand, unlike formation of\nthe mono-iron product. Finally, peaks corresponding to\n[Fe2L3(C6H4O)]\n\u0001\u2022 and [FeL3(C7H5N)]\n\u0001 ions are ob-\nserved. Formation of the [Fe2L3(C6H4O)]\n\u0001\u2022 species oc-\ncurs via cleavage of the aryl imine bond (see Scheme 1)\nand the aryl ether bond. Again, this di-iron product\ndoes not appear to involve hydrogen atom rearrange-\nment. It is concluded that the C6H4O moiety is stabi-\nlized via \u0001 stacking interactions with the phenylene\nrings of the intact ligand, which in turn is coordinated\nto the two Fe centers. Production of the [FeL3(C7H5N)]\n\u0001\nions is less clear. The fragmentation pathway either\ninvolves cleavage of the aryl ether together with the\nbond that connects the pyridine to the imine-carbon, or\ncleavage of the imine bond.\nMS3 of Fe2L12\n2\u0001 and MS\/MS of Cu2L12\n2\u0001 and\nAg2L12\n2\u0001 Complexes\nPerhaps the most intriguing result of electron capture\nby the Fe2L3\n4\u0001 ions is the production of the dinuclear\nScheme 1. Elimination of C6H6N2 fromScheme 2. Cleavage sites observed within ligand L3.double-stranded species Fe2L2\n2\u0001. Analogous species,\nM2L2\n2\u0001, are observed in solution for the monocations\nCuI and AgI. The question arises: Are the iron-bound\ndimers of the form FeI2L2\n2\u0001, i.e., has electron capture in\nthe gas-phase resulted in an iron oxidation state that is\nnot typically accessible in solution? To address this\nquestion, we compared the gas-phase behavior of the\nFe2L12\n2\u0001 ions with that of Ag2L12\n2\u0001 and Cu2L12\n2\u0001 ions.\nThe most abundant fragment ions observed following\nECD, CID, and IRMPD of the Ag2L12\n2\u0001, Cu2L12\n2\u0001, and\nFe2L12\n2\u0001 ions are detailed in Table 2.\nFigure 3a shows the ECDmass spectrum of Ag2L12\n2\u0001\nions following 30 ms irradiation. No intact charge-\nreduced dimeric species are observed. The major prod-\nuct is the metal-bound monomer AgL1\u0001. Although the\npeak corresponding to AgL1\u0001 ions overlaps with that of\nthe precursor Ag2L12\n2\u0001 ions, the presence of the mono-\nmer can be confirmed by examination of the isotopic\nenvelope, see Figure 3a inset top. The red diamonds\nindicate the theoretical distribution of the dimer, and\nthe blue triangles indicate that of the monomer. It could\nbe argued that monomer ions were amongst the dimers\nselected for ECD, i.e., were present either in the solution\nphase or in the gas phase before MS\/MS. However, the\nisotopic envelope of the isolated ions, see Figure 3a\ninset (bottom), suggests that the silver complex is\nentirely, or mostly, dimeric before ECD. The second,\nand minor, product of ECD is AgL12\n\u0001. Presumably, that\nspecies is the result of electron capture by a silver\ncation. Similar behavior has been observed by us pre-\nviously in the ECD of Ag-bound polyamidoamine\n(PAMAM) dendrimer complex [18].\nIn the CID and IRMPD of Ag2L12\n2\u0001 ions, three major\nfragmentation channels were observed. First, dissocia-\ntion of the dinuclear dimer to the mononuclear mono-\nmer was observed. The presence of the Ag-bound\nmonomer following IRMPD is confirmed by the distri-\nbution of the isotopic envelope (see Figure 3c, inset).\nThe isotopic envelope following CID is somewhat\nskewed (Figure 3b, inset). As the CID products were\ndetected in the ICR cell, it was necessary to accumulate\na much larger number of precursor ions than ideal for\noptimal performance of the ion trap. That had the effect\nof altering the ion trajectories due to space-charge\neffects and, to isolate the precursor ions, it was neces-\nsary to center the isolation window on an m\/z value,\nwhich did not correspond to that of the precursors (by\n\u00031 Th).

Second,a peak corresponding to [L1 \u0004 H]\u0001 ions was observed.\nThe loss of AgH, via hydride abstraction, following CID\nof Ag\u0001 complexes of primary and tertiary amines,\n\u0003-amino acids, amino carboxylic acids, aryl alkyl ethers,\nand peptides is well-documented. Mass spectrometry\nexperiments combined with density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations showed that for argentinated amines,\nhydrogen atom attached to the carbon \u0003 to the amino\nnitrogen is cleaved together with the Ag atom in a\n1,2-elimination [36, 37]. It is postulated that the [L1 \u0004\nH]\u0001 product ions observed here are the result of disso-\nciation of the Ag-bound monomer. The third fragmen-\ntation pathway involves loss of cyanide from the ligand.\nPeaks corresponding to [C24H20N3]\n\u0001 and [AgC24H19N3]\n\u0001\nwere observed. Presumably, these fragments are the\nresult of decomposition of the mononuclear monomer.\nSuggested mechanisms for the loss of HCN and AgCN\nfrom the Ag-bound monomer are shown in Scheme 3.\nFigure 4a shows the ECD mass spectrum obtained\nfollowing 30 ms irradiation of Cu2L12\n2\u0001 ions. The major\nproduct is the charge-reduced species Cu2L12\n\u0001\u2022 (see\nTable 2). Examination of the m\/z region around the\nprecursor ions (Figure 4a, inset top) suggests that,\nunlike the silver species, monomeric CuL1\u0001 is not a\nmajor product of electron capture. The precursor m\/z\nregion post-ECD reflects the isotopic envelope of the\nprecursor peak following isolation (Figure 4a, inset\nbottom). In addition to the charge-reduced species, a\nvery low abundance peak corresponding to CuL12\n\u0001\nwas observed. The analogous fragment was observed\nfollowing ECD of the silver-bound dimer. Formation of\nCuL12\n\u0001 must be the result of electron capture by Cu\u0001\nand subsequent loss of the copper atom.\nAs seen for [Ag2L12]\n2\u0001, CID and IRMPD of [Cu2L12]\n2\u0001\nions results in dissociation of dinuclear dimer to mono-\nnuclear monomer [CuL1]\u0001, production of [L1 \u0004 H]\u0001,\nand loss of cyanide from the ligand. The distribution of\nthe isotopic envelope shown in Figure 4c (inset) con-\nfirms the presence of Cu-bound monomer following\nIRMPD. The isotopic envelope following CID is again\nskewed\u2014a consequence of space-charge effects in the\nlinear ion trap\u2014(Figure 4b, inset), however the results\nsuggest that the monomer is formed. The [L1 \u0004 H]\u0001\nproduct ions observed in both CID and IRMPD are the\nresult of the loss of CuH from Cu-bound monomer. The\npeaks corresponding to [C24H20N3]\n\u0001 ions indicate loss\nof CuCN from mononuclear [CuL1]\u0001, and those corre-\nsponding to [CuC24H19N3]\n\u0001 ions indicate loss of HCN.\nBoth processes, i.e., loss of HCN and loss of CuCN,\nmust proceed via intramolecular rearrangements, similar\nto those for the Ag-bound monomer (Scheme 3a and b).\nThe CID and IRMPD MS\/MS spectra obtained for\n[Cu2L12]\n2\u0001 ions also show fragmentation pathways that\nwere not observed for [Ag2L12]\n2\u0001 ions (see Table 2). Peaks\ncorresponding to singly-charged [Cu(L1 \u0004 C5H5N1)]\n\u0001\nand doubly-charged [Cu2L1(L1 \u0004 C5H5N1)]\n2\u0001 ions are\nthe result of the loss of pyridine from the ligands of the\nmononuclear monomer and the dinuclear dimer respec-\ntively.

CuCN lost from\none of the monomers is retained with the second. The\npeaks corresponding to [Cu2L1(C24H19N3)]\n2\u0001 indicate\nloss of HCN from doubly-charged dinuclear dimer\nions. Again, that process was not observed in the case of\nCID and IRMPD of the silver-bound dinuclear dimer.\nFigure 5a shows the ECD MS3 mass spectrum of\n[Fe2L12]\n2\u0001 ions following 25 ms irradiation. The singly-\ncharged mononuclear monomer does not appear to be\nformed (see Figure 5a, inset). The major product is the\ncharge-reduced species [Fe2L12]\n\u0001. The equivalent prod-\nuct was observed following ECD of the copper dimer\nbut not the silver dimer. A peak corresponding to\ndoubly-charged [Fe2L1(L1 \u0004 C6H4N2)]\n2\u0001 ions was also\nobserved in the ECD MS3 spectrum. That peak was also\nobserved in the ECD of the di-iron triple helicate\nfollowing extended irradiation. The equivalent peak\nwas not observed following ECD of either the copper-\nand silver-bound dimers.\nThe SORI-CID and IRMPD MS3 spectra obtained for\nthe ECD-derived [Fe2L12]\n2\u0001 ions (shown in Figure 5b\nand c) are dominated by fragments formed as a result of\ncleavages within the ligand (see Table 2).

The CID and\nIRMPD of the [Ag2L12]\n2\u0001 ions reflected that of the\n[Cu2L12]\n2\u0001 ions but not the [Fe2L12]\n2\u0001 ions.\nThe differences in the observed fragmentation be-\nhavior of [Fe2L12]\n2\u0001, [Cu2L12]\n2\u0001, and [Ag2L12]\n2\u0001 ions in\nECD, CID, and IRMPD appear to track with the first\nionization energies of the metal ions (IE1Ag 7.57 eV,\nIE1Cu 7.73 eV, IE1Fe 7,90 eV). For example, electron\ncapture by the di-iron dimer results in the charge-\nreduced species in high yield; by the di-copper dimer\nresults in the charge-reduced species in lower yield, and\nthe mononuclear monomer; and by the di-silver dimer\nresults in the mononuclear monomer only. This conclu-\nsion is supported by our previous work on metal ion\ncomplexes of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers\n[18], which showed that their ECD and CID behavior\nwere dependent on the ionization energy, valence elec-\ntrons, and charge of the metal ions. Studies on the ECD\nof peptide [22, 26] and lipid complexes [24] have also\nshown that the nature of metal ion dictates dissociation\npathways.\nConclusion\nThe results shown constitute the first application of\nelectron capture dissociation to supramolecular struc-\nture determination. The ECD mass spectra are straight-\nforward to interpret, and information regarding stoichi-\nometry and\/or ligand structure can be obtained through\nvariation of electron irradiation time. Of particular interest\nwas the observation that the gas-phase structure of the\nFeI supramolecular helicates mimicked that of the\nequivalent solution phase CuI and AgI complexes, i.e.,\nthey exist as dinuclear double-stranded species. Com-\nparison of ECD, CID, and IRMPD fragmentation behav-\nior of doubly charged di-iron dinuclear dimer ions with\nthat observed for [Cu2L12]\n2\u0001 and [Ag2L12]\n2\u0001 reveal\nsome similarities. Perhaps the most exciting conclusion\nis that electron capture by gas-phase metal complex\ncations may allow access to oxidation states that are not\nreadily available in solution. Rather than existing solely\nas an analytical technique, ECDmay be used as a source\nfor previously unknown metallo-supramolecules, and\ntheir intrinsic gas-phase chemistry may be studied.\n309J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010, 21, 300\u2013309 ECD OF METALLO-SUPRAMOLECULAR COMPLEXESAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Professor Alan G Marshall, Dr. Chris L.\nHendrickson, and Dr. Nathan Kaiser for providing access to the\nFT-ICR facility at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory,\nFlorida State University, and for technical assistance.
