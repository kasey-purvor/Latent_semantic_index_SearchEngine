A compressed \nplume interaction is proposed as a contributing factor in this change.  \nIntroduction \nLaser ablation is key to growth in the micro and nano manufacturing industries [1-3]. \nTechnology has been continuously refined and improved in terms of laser fluence, optical \nresolution and production speed since the emergence of the technique in the late 1970\u201fs [3]. \nBut at present, progress is held in check by laser ablation generated debris [4-8]. This is \nbecause the capability of laser manufacturing techniques has increased to a level where \ntooling performance is limited not by the repeatability and resolution of the machining \nmethod, but by the deleterious effects of the debris created during the process.  \nObvious benefits would accrue in terms of the quality of existing products and for current \nmanufacturing costs, as well as to ensure new product development and economic growth, to \nremove debris as it is generated and therefore preclude the possibility of the debris causing \nproblems. This is termed an \u201ein-line\u201f methodology and a number of workers have attempted \nto develop effective systems, which include liquid based techniques. A technique for \ndelivering a long wavelength laser radiation to a workpiece by use of a fine jet of water \ndemonstrate that the use of such mediums does not pose unacceptable attenuation of the beam \n[9]. The existence and efficacy of ablation plume etching can be proven by the example of \nlaser induced backside wet etching (LIBWE), pioneered by Wang et al. [10]. This process \nmakes laser machining of laser wavelength transparent materials viable by passing the beam \nthrough the material to be machined and focusing the beam to a point just beyond the far \nsurface of the material in a liquid medium. The ablation plume generated in the liquid \nmedium attacks and etches the material. Moreover, the use of LIBWE has been found by \nothers to provide an increased ablation rate when compared to that achieved on the same \nmaterials by direct machining in ambient air [11-13]. The technique projecting a beam \nthrough a liquid medium and onto the surface is less well characterized. A liquid jetting \nsystem has been developed and patented [14], but little has been published detailing its \nperformance as a technique. The technique of immersing the sample beneath a liquid film \nthat the laser beam traverses to focus on the sample surface has been documented in the effort \nto produce and collect micro- and nano-particles efficiently [15].  \nMajor inroads have been made by Dowding and Lawrence [16-19] to develop a workable in-\nline debris removal system based on ablating under both open and closed thick film flowing \nwater. The introduction of a liquid to an ablation event poses a significant difference to the \ntypical gaseous of vacuum environments used for ablation machining. The mechanism of \nablation in liquids has some significant differences with ablation in gases or a vacuum. The \nmost important of these is that the liquid confines the expansion and movement of the plasma \nplume due to its higher density and viscosity. This confinement can greatly influence the \nthermodynamic and kinetic properties of the plasma and therefore the evolution of the plume. \nThis can give rise to distinctly different scenarios both during vaporization and condensation \ncompared to ablation in gaseous or vacuum environments [20]. \nThe impact of the equipment developed by Dowding and Lawrence [17-19] and the \ntechniques it facilitates on the broader machining parameters involved in laser \nmicromachining. This contribution describes fundamental changes to the techniques involved \nin laser machining with respect to laser machining in ambient air: ablation plume pressure; \noptical focal length; and depth of focus.  \n \nExperimental Procedures \nMaterial Details \nBisphenol A polycarbonate (Holbourne Plastics, Ltd), was as received in 1200 x 1000 mm\n2\n \nsheets of 0.5 mm thickness. Prior to excimer laser processing, the bisphenol A polycarbonate \nsheet was cut into rectangular sections of 8 x 12 mm\n2\n using scissors - a shear cutting \ntechnique which avoids production of debris. Protective cover sheets were then peeled off \neach sample. \nLaser Details and Experimental Set-Up. \nFor both closed immersion and ambient air processing, an excimer laser (LPX200; Lambda \nPhysique, GmbH) using KrF as the excitation medium was used to produce a beam with a \nwavelength of 248 nm over 25 ns pulses. Thereafter, the beam was supplied to a laser \nmicromachining centre (M8000; Exitech, Ltd), where it was passed through a stainless steel \nmask to produce a 201 x 203 \u00b5m\n2\n rectangular image. The masked beam was then \ndemagnified through a 4x optic (Francis Goodhall, Ltd) to produce an ablation spot with a \ndepth of focus (DoF) of 6 \u03bcm. A profile of the masked beam was obtained using a beam \nprofiler (SP620U; Spiricon, Ltd), which showed that the beam shape had an even distribution, \nwith only a slight positive skew across the y-axis; demonstrating good positioning of the \nmask in the raw beam. \nFocus was found by narrowing the focal rage until satisfactory focus was achieved. Pulse \nenergy was measured out of focus, using a power meter head (J50LP-2; Molectron Detector, \nInc.) connected to a reader unit (Energy Max 400; Molectron Detector, Inc.). Spot energies \nwere measured six times for each sample \u2013 three times before the sample was machined and \nthree readings were taken after the sample was machined. Each reading was taken after the \nsystem attenuator had been reset. In this way any change in the beam between measurements \nand any inaccuracy in the positioning of the attenuator were accounted for. \nTen sites were machined on all samples using six pulses for each feature. These were \nproduced at regular, consecutive focal lengths, given in Table 1. In this instance the beam \nwas attenuated by a tool attenuator set at 126\u00b0 from minimum transmission, resulting in a \nbeam fluence of 590.4 mJ\/cm\n2\n \u00b1 9.2 mJ\/cm\n2 \nfor ablation in ambient air and under filtered \nwater immersion that produced features of 203 x 205 \u00b5m\n2\n. This fluence data was calculated \nfrom pulse energy data taken using a pulse energy head (J50LP-2; Molectron Detector, Inc.) \npositioned above the focal point of the laser, and enumerated by a laser energy meter (Energy \nMax 400; Molectron Detector, Inc.). The fluence was calculated using the mean beam energy \nmeasured (averaging techniques were employed for experimental rigour: beam pulse energy \nwas recorded five times before and after machining each sample, every value recorded was \nthe mean value measured over 100 pulses - between readings the attenuator was reset to \naccount for attenuator position errors) so that any changes in laser output over time were \naccounted for. \nAmbient Air Laser Processing \nSamples machined in ambient air were produced, using the same laser and micromachining \nequipment as the closed immersion ablation samples. The bisphenol A polycarbonate samples \nwere mounted directly to the vacuum chuck inside the micromachining station (M8000; \nExitech, Ltd). After lasing ended the sample was removed and placed into the cell of a sealed \nsample tray to protect them from atmospheric dust. \nClosed Thick Film Filtered Water Immersion Laser Processing Procedure \nFigure 1(a) describes the critical experimental layout of the sample once clamped inside the \nflow rig, which was mounted to the side of the sample vacuum chuck of the laser micro-\nprocessing centre (M8000; Exitech, Ltd.). The sample was positioned in the centre of the flat \naluminium table between the water supply and exit holes. The sample was retained by a \nrecess in a spacer plate that lay in contact with the aluminium sample table. An O-ring cord, \nlocated by a rectangular groove in the sample table, provided a seal between the sample table \nand the spacer plate. On the top of the spacer plate a second oval O-ring was housed in \nanother machined groove. This acted as a gasket between the spacer plate and the beam \nwindow \u2013 a 25 x 25 x 5 mm3 ultra-violet grade fused silica sheet (Comar Instruments, Ltd). \nThe beam window was retained by a diamond shaped recess in a third aluminium plate, 8 mm \nin thickness to provide stiffness to the whole sandwich.  \nFigure 1(b) shows the water filtering and supply system. Water originated from normal mains \nsupply by wall tap. The water was poured into a domestic water filter (Britta, Inc.) situated at \nthe top the water supply assembly to remove typical corrosive elements present in mains \nwater. The water was then retained in a header tank located above the pump and, under the \naction of gravity, was forced into the 700 W pump chamber (CPE100P, Clarke Power \nProducts, Ltd.). The pump forced the water through a water flow rate meter (FR4500, Key \nInstruments, Inc.) and then along a 3 m distance through a 6 mm outer diameter nylon tube to \nthe inlet push-in elbow fitting on the bottom of the sample table. Last, the water was returned \nalong a further 3 m through a 6 mm outer diameter nylon tube to a collection bucket. The \npump was capable of producing 4.2 bar at the outlet, equating to a maximum flow rate \nthrough the ablation chamber of 3.89 m\/s, given losses along the supply and return tubing. \nPrecise control of the flow rate was provided by a variable valve of the flow-meter. For this \nwork, a flow velocity of 1.85 m\/s was used for this work.  \nSample Analysis Techniques \nTwo methods can be used to measure and demonstrate the focal range of an optical system. \nThe simplest technique is that of micrograph inspection. This allows identification of features \nthat appear to have ill defined edges. Figure 2a shows a feature that appears sharp, Figure 2b \na figure that is slightly out of focus and Figure 2c a feature that is a long distance from the \nideal focal position. \nAnother, more quantative method than micrograph inspection is the adoption of inductive \nneedle profiling. Using this technique, the cross sectional profiles of features can be obtained, \nallowing more detailed analysis of feature wall angle and sample floor profile. The samples \nwere placed under a needle profiler (Talysurf 300; Taylor-Hobson, Ltd.). Software \n(Mountains; Taylor-Hobson, Ltd) was used to process and interpret the raw data generated. \nProfiles of the features imaged in Figure 2 are given alongside for direct comparison. This \ndemonstrates the possibility of this technique for discreet quantative analysis of the focus of \nthe light at a specific focal length. \nResults and Discussion \nModification of the ablation pressure: a cause for feature floor darkening \nIt is sensible to consider PLA in gaseous media first. Three distinct phases have been \nidentified to occur during such an interaction. The initial phase of the pulse will instigate \nablation, and is termed \u201egeneration\u201f: the gaseous materials ejected from the target will form a \nplasma as depicted in Figure 3(a). The plasma formed will be partially confined by the \nsurrounding gaseous environment; however continued ablation and excitation of the plume \nwill cause the plume to expand, as shown in Figure 3(b) [15]. \nThe ablated species originating from the target material are not suspended in the plasma \nplume. Because both the plasma and the surrounding environment are gaseous in nature, the \ntwo tend to mix. The high energy and temperature state of the plume allows chemical \nreactions to occur between molecules from the two substances to form new compounds, this \nchemical modification is termed \u201etransformation.\u201f. The latter part of the pulse adds energy to \ninstigate these reactions; the mixing of the gas and plume continues after the pulse has ended \nas the next phase begins, as described in Figure 3(c) [15]. \nThe heat contained within the plume begins to diffuse into the surrounding environment at \nthe end of the pulse. The intense thermal diffusion of the species in the plasma plume can \nresult in collisions, leading to aggregations. Thus thermal diffusion is also critical in \ntransformation, before eventually leading to \u201econdensation\u201f of the new mixed species into \nmelt form and finally to solidification resulting in particulate matter [15]. \nFabbro et al. [21] found that a shockwave was induced by the laser induced plasma and was \nconfined to the extents of the plume by the surrounding liquid (see Figure 4). The laser \ninduced plasma adiabatically expands when the plasma absorbs the latter part of the laser \npulse and receives a further supply of vaporized mass from the target material at a supersonic \nvelocity to create a shockwave as described in Figure 4(b). This shockwave will generate \nincreased pressure within the laser induced plasma plume. This increase in pressure generated \nby the shockwave has become known as the \u201eplasma induced pressure\u201f. Thermodynamically, \nthe increase in pressure will be coupled to an increase in temperature of the plasma, causing \nthe laser induced plasma under the confinement of the surrounding liquid to have a higher \ntemperature, pressure and density than that of a plasma generated in a gaseous or vacuum \nenvironment. The plasma induced pressure is dependant upon the wavelength and fluence of \nthe beam involved [22], with the maximum pressure achievable decreasing with increasing \npulse length [23]. \nFabbro has been involved in a wide range of research to understand the nature of the plasma \ninduced in a solid-liquid system [21, 23, 24]. Fabbro and colleagues have produced an \nanalytical model to predict the maximum pressure, pmax, measured in GPa, generated by the \nlaser induced plasma in water: \niPZp\n3\n01.0max\n\uf02b\uf057\n\uf057\n\uf03d ,                (1) \nwhere \uf057  is the fraction of internal energy released as thermal energy (typically 25.0\uf0bb\uf057 ), \nPi, is the incident power intensity and Z is the reduced shock impedance between the target \nand the confining liquid (filtered water), defined as \nettwater ZZZ arg\n112\n\uf02b\uf03d ,                 (2) \nwhere Zair, Zwater and Ztarget are the shock impedances of air, water and the target respectively; \nthese values are identical to those commonly quoted as acoustic impedance values [24], \nmeasured in Rayles (N\/s.m\n3\n). The acoustic impedances for the mediums and material used in \nthis target have been collected [25]: air has an impedance of 413.2 Rayles; water 1480 Rayles \nand Polycarbonate is larger still with 2770 Rayles.  Calculation using the values given above \nand Equations (1) and (2), allows the estimation of the plume pressure during the laser pulse. \nThe pressure generated in ambient air is predicted to be an increase of 7.9 GPa, a large \nincrease over atmospheric pressure; however, the use of filtered water immersion posed a \nsignificantly larger increase in plume pressure of 12.1 GPa, a result that is a multiple of 1.6 \ngreater than the pressure generated in a similar plume in ambient air. \nThe change in plume pressure and the resultant increase in plume temperature, coupled with \ngreater plume density, which had the effect of increasing plume attenuation contributions \nwhen machining using closed thick film filtered water immersion of the sample may impact \nthe machining mechanism in several significant manners. The result of this is evident in the \ndarkened surface of the all the samples machined. Cleaning of these samples did not result in \nremoval of this blackened surface as the two features given in Figure 5 show: Figure 5(a) \ngives a sample after machining without any post-process cleaning, clearly displaying the \ncharacteristic darkened surface attribute of closed thick film filtered water immersed laser \nmachining; Figure 5(b) shows the sample feature following 10 minutes ultrasonic cleaning in \nDI water. \nThe apparent change in medium chemistry could be a result of charring of the feature surface. \nThis charring could have been promoted by increased plume temperature which was  \nthermodynamically coupled with the calculated increased plume pressure. However, the lack \nof impact caused by ultrasonic bath immersion of 10 minutes in ultrapure water on the feature \nshown in Figure 5 suggests that this is not a significant contributor in this case, as such a \nrigorous cleaning technique should have removed oxidised detritus from the feature surface \nleaving an apparently brighter surface.   \nAlternately, the darkening could be the result of a number of scenarios. Previous research has \nidentified the existence of laser ablation generated and controllable surface plasmon features \non the surfaces of nanoparticles manufactured using laser ablation [26, 27]. The quaziparticle \noffers a method of specifying a magnitude of the cumulative plasma oscillation existent in the \nfree electron gas of any substance [26]. A surface plasmon is a more specific item, that occurs \nonly on the outer electron shells of exposed atoms of surfaces. These interact strongly with \nlight, causing significant polarization of planar light, it is these that produce the anomalies \nrecorded in diffraction of light from metal surfaces [28]. Surface plasmons can have critical \nmodification of the reflected electromagnetic radiation; they have been used to modify the \napparent colour of surfaces and can afford the ability for low optical diffraction levels below \nthe traditional optical diffraction limit [29]. Both of these effects can go some way to explain \nthe observed darkening of the features machined under closed thick film flowing filtered \nwater immersion. Some previous contributions have proposed that plasmon production and \nsize is proportional to laser ablation plume pressure [26], thus the pressure increase calculated \nabove for the techniques described in this contribution could result in significant modification \nto the interaction between light and the surface of machined features. \nAdditionally, the modification of the ablation mechanism, to feature a significant plume \netching contribution as alluded to in previous contributions [18, 19, 30], where the drag of \nimmersion fluid flowing past the ablation plume distorted the plume geometry. Varying the \nflow velocity resulted in modified ablation threshold [18], ablation rate [30] and surface \ntopography [19]. The recorded modification of surface topography demonstrated that the \nsurface roughness was proportional to flow velocity and laser fluence. It also demonstrated a \nsignificant increase in surface roughness of the features. This increase in surface roughness \nwould have the effect of high diffusivity of light supplied from the microscope objective, \nreducing the intensity of light reflected to the camera as described schematically in Figure 6. \nSuch a characteristic could doubtlessly have a significant use in the displays or lighting \nindustry, where even light distribution over a broad area is a desirable feature. \n \nModification to the focal length of the optical system. \n A simplistic prediction of the change in focal position of the laser system could be \ncalculated before any machining was conducted, using the technique of ray tracing [31]. For a \ntrue calculation of the beam characteristics, thin lens theory states that a number of \ndimensions must be known for an imaging system such as that used in an Excimer laser \nmicromachining tool, as illustrated in Figure 7. The system described in Figure 7 is a simple \ncase where the beam does not experience any change in medium. The system involved in the \nablation of a substrate immersed in a closed thick film of filtered water is much more \ncomplex, requiring the beam to pass from the demagnifying optic, into the ambient air of the \nsystem, on to enter the substrate immersion apparatus fluid enclosing window before finally \nleaving the window and traversing the immersion fluid itself. The changing refractive index \nwill have the effect of modifying each ray as described in Figure 7. If the angle of incidence \nof a ray, \u03b8i, is known, the refraction at each stage can be calculated rearranging the definition \nof the refractive index to give: \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d \uf02d\nn\ni\nr\n\uf071\n\uf071\nsin\nsin 1         (3) \nto give the angle of refraction of the same ray. The maximum angle of incidence, can be \nfound when the distance between the beam and the substrate and the change in radius of the \nbeam are known. The tool used in this contribution had a lens \u2013 substrate separation of \napproximately 65 mm (calculated to be 63.438 mm using thin lens theory); the radius of a \nplanar wave passing the edge of the mask orifice was 400 \u00b5m and then went on to pass \nthrough the edge of the lens and being demagnified to the focal point where the image had a \nradius of 102 \u00b5m, giving a maximum angle of incidence, denoted as \u03b8ia and described by line \n\u201eIa\u201f in Figure 7, of 0.45\u00b0. \nThe other image defining ray passes from the edge of the mask, through the centre of the lens \nand onto the opposite edge of the image at the feature, labelled as \u201eIb\u201f in Figure 7 which will \nnow be denoted \u03b8ib. In the case of the tool used for this work, the distance between the mask \nand the substrate was 250 mm, thus knowing the dimensions of the mask, feature and the \nseparation of lens and substrate as stated above, gives an angle of incidence of 0.09\u00b0 for \u03b8ib. \nWhen a ray passes from one medium to another, the relationship between the refractive \nindices of both mediums must be taken into account. This is done by application of Snell\u201fs \nlaw [32], which can be written as \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d \uf02d\n2\n11 sinsin\nn\nn i\nr\n\uf071\n\uf071         (4) \nwhere n1 is the refractive index of the medium being passed from and n2 is the medium being \npassed to. \nUsing Snell\u201fs Law, it can be calculated that a ray passing from the medium of air surrounding \nthe micromachining centre, that possesses a refractive index value of 1.0008 for \nelectromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 248 nm [33], into the ultra violet (UV) grade \nfused silica, which possessed a measured refractive index of 1.5084 at the same wavelength \n[34], resulted in the modification to the path vectors of Ia and Ib. As the light passed through \nthe fused silica window the angle of refraction of Ia, \u03b8ra, was 0.3\u00b0, and the angle of refraction \nof Ib was 0.06\u00b0. \nAs one can see in Figure 8, the angle of the refraction at the first medium interface becomes \nthe angle of incidence for the second, denoted as \u03b8ii in Figure 8. Again, Snell\u201fs Law can be \nused here to calculate the final range of angles of refraction, \u03b8rr, of any rays including or \nbetween Ia and Ib in Figure 7. The reactive index of filtered water on 248 nm wavelength \nelectromagnetic radiation is 1.3787 [35]. Knowing this, and assuming the boundary between \nthe water and the fused silica window is regular and without cavity, the angles of refraction, \n\u03b8rra and \u03b8rrb are derived to be 0.3\u00b0 and 0.07\u00b0 respectively. \nGiven these angles of modification and knowing the micromachining system was left \nunchanged as the laser machining was moved from ambient air to having the liquid \nimmersion equipment mounted and filled with flowing filtered water, the change in focal \nlength of the optical system can be calculated using successive application of simple \ntrigonometry. The thick film flowing immersion equipment used for this contribution was \ncomposed of 1.5 mm of filtered water covered by 5 mm UV grade fused silica. Knowing \nthese dimensions allows the calculation of the modification to the focal length of the system, \ndenoted \u0394l in Figure 8, which was predicted to be a 2.958 mm increase. \nIn reality, the immersion rig sample mounting surface was mounted 1.7 mm beneath the level \nof the vacuum chuck, The two features, machined in ambient air and under thin film flowing \nfiltered water immersion with optimum focus are indicated by a square in Figure 9(a) and \nFigure 9(b) respectively. The stage height of the lowest sample in Figure 9(a) was at 3.475 \nmm from it\u201fs home position. The stage elevation between each feature was 0.025 mm, \nmeaning that the focal position for machining in ambient air was found at 3.675 mm from the \nhome position of the stage. For the closed thick film filtered water immersed samples, shown \nin Figure 9(b) the lowest feature height was 2.275 mm from the homing position, meaning \nthe focal position was found in this case to be 2.475 mm. This gives an increased focal length \nby relative stage position of 1.2 mm for the immersed sample over that of the sample \nmachined in ambient air. Coupling this value with the 1.7 mm deviation in mounting height \nresults in a 2.9 mm increase in focal length, a value very close to that predicted \nmathematically above. This result means that the modification of beam path can be easily \npredicted given known equipment dimensions, when using closed thick film flowing \nimmersed laser ablation machining techniques. \n \nModification to the depth of focus \nThe depth of focus is the tolerance in the focal length of the optical system used to guide a \nlaser beam from the source, through the objective, through the demagnifying lens and onto \nthe image. The depth of focus is defined primarily by the characteristics of the demagnifying \nlens; but, the application of further optics may modify this dimension. Moreover, modifying \nthe ablation mechanism from one that is dependant upon the laser etching provided by a \nbeam in focus, to one that can operate using the etching contribution of a compressed plume \nby use of a compressed ablation plume, as has been proposed previously [17-19, 30], could \npresent the possibility of an increased range of focal length that produces an acceptable image \nthat can be deemed to be \u201ein focus\u201f. Alternatively, the implication of such a mechanism could \nequally reduce the range of focal length that produces an equivalent feature definition to that \nin ambient air. \nFigure 10 plots the average wall angle, taken from 10 profiles of features machined at each \nfocal length, with respect to 10 focal displacements, separated by increments of 0.05 mm. \nTwo plots are given, a plot describing the angle between level and the wall of ten features \nmachined in ambient air and for a feature machined under closed thick film flowing filtered \nwater ablation at intervals of 0.1 mm in focal length. These results show that use of \nimmersion can produce wall angles equivalent to those achieved by laser machining in \nambient air; however, the range of focal length that high wall angles were produced in was \nsmaller when using laser ablation under closed laser ablation immersion. This result indicates \nthat the depth of focus is reduced. Interpolation of the polynomial best fit given for each \ngroup of data identifies that a wall angle greater than 77\u00ba was achieved by ambient air over a \nrange of 0.2 mm. For the samples machined using laser ablation under closed thick film \nflowing filtered water immersion, this range was 0.15. This indicates a reduction in the depth \nof focus of the system by 25% when using immersion. This result cannot be the result of an \noptical change to the beam by the immersing fluid and associated equipment; the installation \nof this apparatus has the effect of reducing the separation of the rays Ia and Ib, as denoted in \nFigure 7, where the beam was 3 mm above the surface of the material. Hence the actual depth \nof focus was marginally increased as reduced divergence between the rays was afforded. \nGiven this knowledge, it is clear that the modification to the ablation plume by use of closed \nthick film flowing filtered water ablation results in reduced feature definition, when using the \nflow velocity of 1.85 m\/s as used for this work. \nConclusions \nComparison of the calculated ablation pressure and the effect on feature surface \ncharacteristics is given for laser ablation of bisphenol A polycarbonate in ambient against the \nlaser ablation of the same substrate under closed thick film flowing filtered water immersion. \nAlso, the impact of such immersion equipment on the optical performance of the \nmicromachining centre used is quantified and reviewed. \nThe characteristics of pulsed laser ablation in gaseous mediums, such as air, are known and \nwell documented. This occurred in four phases; three of these are of interest for laser ablation \nmachining of features in materials. Interaction of the laser beam with the surface results in \n\u201egeneration\u201f of a laser ablation plume. This plume then absorbed a proportion of laser energy \nby various contribution plume attenuation effects, resulting in plume heating and rapid \nvolumetric expansion of the plume, which was resisted little by the surrounding gaseous \nmedium. Thermal diffusion then followed and with it came condensation and plume collapse. \nThe lack of constraint to the expansion of the plume results in a plume with short life and low \ninternal pressure, calculated to be 7.9 GPa, using previously defined equations and the \nappropriate shockwave impedance values for the materials and medium used. \nImmersion of the ablation plume in filtered water resulted in a modification to the ablation \nmechanism as has been documented previously. The ablation plume was less free to expand \nonce generated by the initial phase of the laser pulse, this restriction in growth was caused by \nthe increased viscosity of the filtered water medium and the vastly larger shock impedance \nthat comes associated. The compression of the ablation plume resulted in a calculated plume \npressure of 12.1 GPa, an increase of 53% over the value achieved in ambient air. Increased \npressure resulted in associated thermal increase and greater plume density, thus increasing the \ncombined plume attenuation effects - further raising the plume temperature.  \nSurface oxidation and charring could be the cause for the darkened feature base surfaces \nobserved to be a result of using this equipment; however, this is unlikely after ultrasonic bath \nimmersion in ultra pure water did not remove significant amounts of charred material as \nwould have been expected. Previous contributors have shown a correlation between laser \nablation plume pressure and surface Plasmon size and frequency. Since the ablation plume \npressure was increased significantly by laser ablation plume confinement when using closed \nthick film flowing filtered water immersion, this phenomena could be the cause, partially or \nas contributor thereof; where the darkening is an optical symptom of the plasmons. It is \nbelieved the largest contribution was given by the effect of dramatically increased surface \nroughness, where the amplitude of surface asperities with base areas lower than 16 \u00b5m\n2\n, \nacted to reflect light unevenly from the surface to diffuse the light and prevent it from being \nreflected back to the observer through the microscope objective. If this was the case, such a \ncharacteristic could doubtlessly have a significant use in the displays or lighting industry, \nwhere even light distribution over a broad area is a desirable feature. \nThe refraction of the laser image by introduction of the closed thick film flowing filtered \nwater immersion was calculated by use of the thin lens theorem, Snell\u201fs law and the ray \ntracing technique. This technique predicted an increase to the focal length of the system of \n2.958 mm, given the known thicknesses of 1.5 and 5.0 mm and refractive indexes for 248 nm \nradiation of 1.3787 and 1.5084 of the filtered water and UV grade fused silica respectively, \nobstructing the beam when the equipment was installed in the ambient air of the \nmicromachining centre used, which typically has a refractive index of 1.0008. The actual \nincrease in focal length measured to be in best focus when using the closed thick film flowing \nfiltered water immersion equipment was 2.9 mm, showing that this modelling technique is \nrelatively accurate and can be used as a tool for simple and quick system design. \nThe modification to the depth of focus was measured discretely by comparing the variance in \nwall angle as samples machined in ambient air and under closed thick film flowing filtered \nwater immersion moved outside the focal tolerance of the demagnifying optic installed in the \nmicromachining centre. This findings of this work indicated that the use of closed thick film \nflowing filtered water immersion can match the level of focus achieved by laser machining in \nambient air. When machining bisphenol A polycarbonate in ambient air, the focal length of \nthe system could vary by 0.1 mm around the optimum focus to produce a measured mean \nwall angle of more than 77\u00ba; the same wall angle was only achievable over a range of 0.075 \nmm when machining under closed thick film flowing filtered water immersion. This indicates \na 25% reduction in depth of focus, that cannot be accredited to beam modification by the \nequipment, as this actually had the effect of  increasing the depth of focus by virtue of \nreducing the angle of convergence of the characteristic rays in the image. This loss in \nperceived depth of focus must be due to the modification and proposed increased contribution \nof plume etching to the ablation mechanism. \nReferences \n1. Rizvi, N.
