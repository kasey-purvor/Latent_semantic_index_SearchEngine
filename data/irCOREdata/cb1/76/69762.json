INTRODUCTION\nTime variability and nonlinearity are natural ingredients\nof physiological systems. In addition, a system\u2019s environ-\nment and its own internal complexity often create a strong\nfluctuational background that is frequently an essential fea-\nture of the dynamics. It is a context where physiological\nmodels are rarely known from first principles, and model\nidentification and parameter inference become indispensable\nfrom the points of view of both fundamental and applied\nphysiology \u00031,2\u0004 and in view of likely medical applications.\nIn many situations, the real-time tracking of physiological\nparameters is the key to successful applications including,\ne.g., brain-controlled interfaces \u00033,4\u0004. However, the interplay\nof noise, nonlinearity, and the time variability of the model\nparameters makes it difficult to extract reliable information\nfrom the data, and very difficult to do so quickly. Accord-\ningly, the simplifying assumptions of linearity and\/or deter-\nminism \u00032,5\u0004 are frequently made in an attempt to facilitate\ninference rather than on physiological grounds.\nIn addition, physiologically important parameters that de-\nscribe specific features of the system state or system dynam-\nics are not usually directly measurable and have to be in-\nferred from measurements of other types of information. At\npresent, there are no general methods available to solve this\nproblem if the model is stochastic, nonlinear, and nonstation-\nary, i.e., its parameters vary in time.\nIn paper I \u00036\u0004, we introduced a general Bayesian frame-\nwork that allows one to identify a nonlinear stochastic model\nfrom time-series data and to infer its time-varying parameters\nin real time. In the present paper, we verify the approach by\napplying it to the analysis of a model of physiological sig-\nnaling. The model chosen is a set of the FitzHugh-Nagumo\n\u0001FHN\u0002 systems \u00037\u20139\u0004. It has been found useful in analyzing\ndynamics of nerve fibers \u000310\u0004 and certain muscle cells in\nheart tissue \u000311\u201313\u0004. It has also been used intensively in stud-\nies of passive myelinated axons \u000314\u0004 and various forms of\narrythmia and cardiac activation evolution \u000315\u0004. The control\nof such neural-related dynamics is important in the context\nof biotechnological applications ranging from neural models\nof voluntary movement \u000316\u0004 to studies of control in nerve\nconduction \u000317\u0004.\nIn our model, the measured signals corresponding to fast\nvariables of the FHN system \u0001e.g., action potentials\u0002 are\nmixed by the unknown measurement matrix. Slow variables\nare hidden, which is the case in most real applications. It is\nassumed that physiological information is coded in the time-\nvarying control parameters \u0001 of each FHN system. Our goals\nwill be to reconstruct the hidden variables and the measure-\nment matrix, to learn the parameters of each individual sys-\ntem, and to use this information for extracting the time varia-\ntion of the control parameter \u0001 in real time. We will show, in\nparticular, that the approach is able to decode large stepwise\nchanges, as well as random and continuous variations of the\ncontrol parameter, for each oscillator in real time. Further-\nmore, we will show that the parameter-tracking algorithm\ncan effectively be embedded into the inferential learning\nframework, enabling us to reconstruct both the unmeasured\n\u0001hidden\u0002 variables of the FHN oscillators and the model pa-\nrameters. For simplicity, we will assume that FHN systems\nare not coupled and that the dynamical equation for the slow\nvariable does not include a random force. However, both\ncoupling and noise in the hidden variables can be incorpo-\nrated into the method, as will be shown elsewhere.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, a model of\nFHN systems coupled by an unknown measurement matrix\nis presented and then reduced to standard form suitable for\nanalysis within the Bayesian framework. Convergence of the\nmodel parameters for the case of stationary signals is dis-\ncussed in Sec. III. Their convergence and online tracking\nwhen the system is nonstationary are presented in Sec. IV.\nFinally, the results obtained are summarized and conclusions\nare drawn in Sec. V.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 77, 061106 \u00012008\u0002\n1539-3755\/2008\/77\u00016\u0002\/061106\u000110\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society061106-1\nII. SYSTEM OF FITZHUGH-NAGUMO OSCILLATORS\nIn a typical physiological situation, neurons fire at the rate\nof \u00055\u201310 s\u22121. The correlation time of the control parameter\nis \u0005500\u20131000 ms. The correlation times of other model pa-\nrameters in the nonstationary case are \u00055 s. A typical sam-\npling rate for measurements is \u000520 kHz. In order to follow\nthe time variations, it is necessary for the computation time\nto be less than the shortest characteristic time in the system,\ni.e., that for variation of the control parameters. So we must\naim for a computational inference delay time of less than\n500 ms.\nTo model this spiking activity, we use the well-known\nFitzHugh-Nagumo system in the form\nv\u02d9 j = \u2212 v j\u0001v j \u2212 \u0002 j\u0002\u0001v j \u2212 1\u0002 \u2212 qj + \u0001 j + \u0006Dji\u0003i,\nq\u02d9j = \u2212 \u0004qj + \u0005 jv j ,\n\u0007\u0003 j\u0001t\u0002\u0003i\u0001t\u0001\u0002\b = \u0006ij\u0006\u0001t \u2212 t\u0001\u0002, j = 1:L . \u00011\u0002\nThis system \u00011\u0002 represents the simplified dynamics of L non-\ninteracting neurons \u00038\u0004, where v j model the membrane po-\ntentials and qj are slow recovery variables. Figure 1 illus-\ntrates the dynamics for one oscillator in the absence of noise;\nvalues of the other parameters are \u0002=0.4, \u0001=0.3, \u0004\n=0.0151, and \u0005=0.0153.\nWe assume that the important physiological information is\nencoded in the parameters \u0001i, which control the frequency of\nfiring. In practice, this information is difficult to extract be-\ncause signals collected from biological systems are noisy and\noften mixed with an unknown measurement matrix. To ana-\nlyze the situation in a realistic way, we introduce dynamical\nnoise into the model system \u00011\u0002 and a measurement matrix X\ninto the following measurement model:\nyi = Xijv j . \u00012\u0002\nHere yi are measured variables, related to v j by linear trans-\nformation with the unknown matrix X. An example of noisy\nsignals before and after the mixing is shown in Fig. 2. We\nsuppose that the only accessible information is contained in\nyi. The problem is therefore to learn the model parameters\nM= \t\u0001i ,\u0002i ,qi\u00010\u0002 ,\u0005i ,Dij ,Xij\n from the time-series data \tyi\n,\nand to use this information for fast on-line tracking of the\ntime-varying parameters \t\u0001i\n for each neuron. It was shown\nin paper I that this problem can be treated within a general\ninferential framework by integrating the middle set of equa-\ntions in Eqs. \u00011\u0002 to obtain\nqj\u0001t\u0002 = \u0005 j\u000b\n0\nt\nd\u0007e\u2212\u0004\u0001t\u2212\u0007\u0002v j\u0001\u0007\u0002 + e\u2212\u0004tqj\u00010\u0002 . \u00013\u0002\nOn substituting Eq. \u00013\u0002 into the top equation in Eqs. \u00011\u0002, we\nhave\n0\n0.4\n0.8\n1.2\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nv\n,q\nt (s)\n(a)\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n-0.4 0 0.4 0.8 1.2\nq\nv\n(b)\nq. =\n0\nv .=0\nFIG. 1.

In what\nfollows, we demonstrate this point using as an example a\nsystem of two FHN oscillators. However, the results reported\nbelow can be readily extended to a set of L linearly coupled\nFHN systems. We will refer to system \u00015\u0002 as \u201ctransformed\ndynamics\u201d to distinguish it from the \u201creduced dynamics\u201d of\nEq. \u00014\u0002.\nIII. STATIONARY DYNAMICS AND CONVERGENCE\nTo infer the parameters of the system of L FHN oscillators\n\u00015\u0002 within the stationary regime, we introduce the following\nbase functions:\n\b\u0001x\u0002 = \t1,y1, . . . ,yL,y1\n2\n,y1y2, . . . ,y1yL,y2\n2\n,y2y3, . . . ,\ny2yL, . . . ,y1\n3\n,y1\n2y2, . . . ,y1\n2yL,y2\n3\n,y2\n2y1, . . . ,\ny2\n2yL, . . . ,yL\n2yL\u22121,yL\n3\n,\t1, . . . ,\tL,e\n\u2212\u0004t\n , \u00016\u0002\nwhere \ti is defined as follows:\n\ti \u000f \u000b\n0\nt\nyi\u0001\u0007\u0002e\u0004\u0001\u0007\u2212t\u0002d\u0007 .\nThe number of base functions,\nN\b = 2 + 2L +\nL\u0001L + 1\u0002\n2\n+ L2, \u00017\u0002\nincreases as L2 with the number of systems. The number of\nunknown coefficients of the system \u00015\u0002 is Nc=N\b\nL+L2\n+ L\u0001L+1\u00022 ; it increases as L\n3 with the dimension of the system.\nThe first term in Nc is the full set of unknown coefficients,\nbecause all possible combinations of the powers of y are\nincluded in this set, i.e., it covers the whole model space of\nthe system with polynomial base functions up to power 3.\nThe second term in Nc is the number of unknown elements of\nthe measurement matrix X, while the third is the number of\nelements of the unknown noise matrix. Only Ninf=N\b\nL\n+ L\u0001L+1\u00022 coefficients can be inferred directly from the time-\nseries data \tyi\n, and therefore only Ninf equations can be\nformed to find the coefficients of the original system \u00014\u0002 and\nthe elements of the matrix X. In practice, however, the num-\nber of coefficients of the original system is always signifi-\ncantly smaller than the full set Ninf, because of the symmetry\nthat is always present in real systems. In particular, the num-\nber of unknown coefficients in the original system \u00012\u0002, \u00014\u0002 is\nNM=6L+L2+\nL\u0001L+1\u0002\n2 \u0001note that here we have counted coeffi-\ncients for yi\n2 and yi\n3\u0002. That is, for a system of two FHN\noscillators we have Ninf=29 equations to reconstruct NM\n=19 coefficients.\nSo it should be possible at least in principle to reconstruct\nall unknown coefficients of the original system for any num-\nber of FHN oscillators, provided that we can establish the\nconnection between the set\nM\u02dc = \t\u0001\u02dci,\u0002\u02dcij,b\u02dcijk, c\u02dcijkl,\u0005\u02dcij, q\u02dci\u00010\u0002,D\u02dc ij\n\nof measured variables of the transformed system \u00015\u0002 and the\nset\nM = \t\u0001i,\u0002i,bi,ci,\u0005i,qi\u00010\u0002,Dij,Xij\n\nof unknown parameters of the original reduced dynamics \u00014\u0002,\nwhere bi= \u0001\u0002i+1\u0002 and ci=\u22121.

Note also that it is a simple matter to ex-\ntend Eqs. \u00019\u0002\u2013\u000115\u0002 to encompass the L-dimensional case.\nIn the new notation, the two-dimensional equations for\nthe reduced dynamics take the form\ny\u02d9i = \u0001\u02dci + \u0002\u02dcijyj + b\u02dcik1k2yk1yk2 + c\u02dcik1k2yk1yk2\n2 + e\u2212\u0004tq\u02dci\n\u2212 \u0005ij\u000b\n0\nt\ne\u0004\u0001t\u2212\u0007\u0002yjd\u0007 + \u0006D\u02dc ij\u0003 j\u0001t\u0002 , \u000116\u0002\nEquation \u000116\u0002 with the N\b=13 base functions \u00018\u0002 allows one\nto apply explicitly the results of paper I \u00036\u0004 to infer the Ninf\n=29 parameters of the transformed system \u000116\u0002. Indeed, the\nbase functions \u00018\u0002 and the model parameters in Eq. \u000116\u0002 can\nbe used to factorize the vector field according to Eqs. \u00017\u0002 and\n\u00018\u0002 of \u00036\u0004. The minus log-likelihood function and its gradient\nfor the transformed system \u000116\u0002 can then be written using\nEqs. \u00016\u0002 and \u000126\u0002 of \u00036\u0004. At the next step, Eqs. \u000110\u0002\u2013\u000114\u0002 of\nthe main algorithm of \u00036\u0004 can be used to reconstruct the\nmodel parameters of the transformed system. Once the pa-\nrameters of the transformed system have been inferred, one\ncan use Eqs. \u00019\u0002\u2013\u000113\u0002 to reconstruct the parameters of the\noriginal model \u00011\u0002.\nIn the rest of this section, we restrict ourselves to the 2D\ncase and analyze the convergence of the method under sta-\ntionary conditions. Our goals will be to show the correlation\nbetween the convergence of the model parameters and the\ndecay of the eigenvalues \t\fi\n of matrix \u0005\u02c6 \u22121 \u0001see paper I\u0002, and\nto demonstrate how one can speed up the convergence by\norders of magnitude by reducing the number of base func-\ntions in an appropriate way.\nA. Convergence of the parameters of the transformed\ndynamics\nIn this section, we analyze the convergence of the model\nparameters of the reduced dynamics \u00014\u0002 as a function of T\n=hN, where h is the sampling time step and N is the number\nof points in a block of data. The model \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 was\nintegrated using the Heun scheme \u000318\u0004 with the set of param-\neters shown in Table I. The fast variables of the FHN oscil-\nlators v1\u0001t\u0002 and v2\u0001t\u0002 were mixed by the measurement matrix\nX to generate synthetic time-series data y1\u0001t\u0002 and y2\u0001t\u0002 of\nmeasured signals. The latter signals were used as the input\nfor testing the algorithm. An example of the signals\nv1\u0001t\u0002 ,v2\u0001t\u0002 and y1\u0001t\u0002 ,y2\u0001t\u0002 is shown in Fig. 2.\nWe now analyze the convergence of the method in the\ncase in which all parameters of the reduced model \u00015\u0002, in-\ncluding elements of the measurement matrix, are unknown.\nAn example of the convergence of parameters for the re-\nduced model is shown in Fig. 3. The sampling rate was\n35 kHz. We used nine blocks of data with 5000 points in\neach block, and these blocks of data were generated at ran-\ndom 1000 times to analyze the statistics of the convergence.\nThe results of the inference are summarized in Table II. It\ncan be seen that convergence of better than 3.5% is achieved\nin less then 1 s, even though the coefficients of the highest\norder polynomials are assumed unknown.\nB. Reconstruction of the mixing matrix\nTo reconstruct both the mixing matrix X and the param-\neters of the original systemM from the inferred parameters\nM\u02dc of the transformed system \u00015\u0002, we have to solve Eqs.\n\u00019\u0002\u2013\u000113\u0002 with respect to elements ofM\u02dc . We note that, in the\ngeneral case of the measurement model, these equations are\nnonlinear and can be written implicitly as Fk\u0001M\u0002=0, k\n=1, . . . ,K, where K is the number of equations. In the par-\nticular case of transformation given by the simple form of\nEqs. \u00019\u0002\u2013\u000113\u0002, the solution of this problem can be found by\nusing the standard nonlinear least-squares method \u000319\u0004, al-\nthough an additional optimization over the set of initial val-\nues may be required. We stress that the present technique is\nTABLE I.

Ex-\namples of convergence of the model parameters and of the\nelements of the measurement matrix are given in Figs. 4 and\n5, and are summarized in Table III. It can be seen from the\ntable that a relative error of inference of better than 2% is\nachieved within less than 1 s of measurement time.\nIn what follows, we will focus on the convergence of the\ncontrol parameters \u0001i and analyze the accuracy and speed of\nthe convergence under various assumptions about the time\ndependence of these parameters and information available\nabout other parameters of the system.\nC. Convergence speed\nWe note that the calculation of the rate of convergence of\nmodel parameters of stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems\nis, in general, still an open problem. Here we provide a brief\ndiscussion, however, based on the results of Sec. II C of\npaper I \u00036\u0004. These indicate that the eigenvalues of the matrix\n\u0005\u02c6 \u0003see Eq. \u000122\u0002 of paper I\u0004 play an important role in the\nconvergence of the model parameters. The meaning of the\nmatrix \u0005\u02c6 is twofold: first, \u0005\u02c6 is the covariance of the poste-\nrior density, so it measures directly how sharply this distri-\nbution is peaked about its mean value; second, \u0005\u02c6 is propor-\ntional to D\u02c6 \u0001\u0006\u02c6 k\n\u22121 \u0003see Eq. \u000122\u0002 of paper I\u0004, so it is directly\ninfluenced by the choice of the base functions and by the\ncorrelations between them. It is clear, in particular, that in the\ncase of polynomial base functions, the lower the order of\npolynomials, the smaller will be the eigenvalues of \u0005\u02c6 \u22121, and\nthe faster will be their convergence. Indeed, the deviation of\nthe model parameters from their limiting mean values is pro-\nportional to a linear combination of the eigenvalues \fi of\n\u0005\u02c6 \u22121. So the convergence of the model parameters is deter-\nmined by the values and decay rates of the largest eigenval-\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n0 0.5 1\n\u03b7~ 1\nt (s)\n(a)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n0 0.5 1\nb~ 1\n11\nt (s)\n(b)\nFIG. 3.

The latter in turn depend on the a priori infor-\nmation available about the model parameters. For the\npolynomial base functions, which is the case of transformed\ndynamics \u00015\u0002, the most important information from the point\nof view of convergence speed is knowledge of the coeffi-\ncients for the polynomials of higher order.\nTo illustrate this point, we calculate the eigenvalues of\n\u0005\u02c6 \u22121 under various assumptions about the number of known\nparameters in the model. The results of this analysis are\nshown in Fig. 6. It can be seen from the figure that when no\ninformation is available about model parameters \u0001i.e., all the\nparameters are unknown\u0002, the largest eigenvalue of \u0005\u02c6 \u22121 has\nan initial value of the order 102 and decays to 10\u22122 over a\nmeasurement time t=1.3 s. The correlation between the de-\ncay of the largest eigenvalue and the convergence of the \u0001\nparameters in this case is evident from Fig. 5. When the\ncoefficients of the cubic and quadratic terms in system \u00014\u0002\nare known, the value of the largest \fi of \u0005\u02c6 \u22121 \u0001shown by the\nblue dashed line in Fig. 6\u0002 is reduced by three orders of\nmagnitude. When all parameters of the system \u00014\u0002 are known\nexcept the control parameters \u0001i, the largest value of \fi of\n\u0005\u02c6 \u22121 \u0001shown by the black dotted lines in Fig. 6\u0002 is further\nreduced by two orders of magnitude.\nIn the latter case, convergence of the inferred parameters\n\u0001i to their true values is much faster. To verify this point, the\nfollowing test was performed: \u0001i\u0002 first a signal of length 1 s\nwas generated with stationary dynamics and used to infer all\nthe model parameters; \u0001ii\u0002 next, the parameters \u0001i were\nchanged in a steplike manner; and \u0001iii\u0002 the convergence of\nthe inferred parameters \u0001i was analyzed as a function of the\nlength of the step.

The parameters \u00011 and \u00012 are\nallowed to change at random in time in a steplike manner,\nand remain constant between steps. The time interval be-\ntween steps is approximately five periods of firing of the\naction potential and contains one block of data with 20 000\npoints. Other parameters of the model are fixed at the con-\nstant values given in Table I. At each step, we infer all pa-\nrameters of the model assuming their initial values to be zero\nand their initial dispersion to be infinity, as already discussed\nabove.\nThe results of this test are shown in Fig. 8.

As mentioned\nabove, however, the time resolution of the method can be\nimproved substantially by considering the other parameter of\nthe model to be known on the time scale of a few seconds\n\u0001corresponding to their correlation time, see Sec. II\u0002 and\ntracking in time only the time-varying control parameters \u0001i.\n2. Tracking control parameters with known dynamics\nWe now investigate how fast physiological parameters\ncan be tracked in time. It was shown above \u0001see Sec. III C\u0002\nthat the convergence speed depends on information about the\nmodel parameters that is available a priori, and that the fast-\nest time resolution can be achieved when all the parameters\nof the model, except the control parameters \u0001i, are known.\nTo demonstrate this effect, we now assume that \u00011 and \u00012\nchange stepwise at random and remain constant between\nsteps as above, but that all other parameters of the model\nremain fixed at known values. The time interval between\nsteps is now approximately 0.03 s and contains one block of\ndata with 1000 points. The results of Fig. 9 show that the\nmethod can track random, stepwise variations of the control\nparameters with a time resolution of less than 0.03 s \u0001i.e.,\nsmaller by more than two orders of magnitude than in the\nprevious case where all parameters had to be inferred\u0002.\nB. Continuously varying control parameters with noise\nTo complete our analysis of the reconstruction of nonsta-\ntionary dynamics of the physiological model, we now infer\nsmoothly varying parameters \u00011 and \u00012 with added noise,\nwithout knowing any other parameters of the model. The test\nis performed as follows: \u0001i\u0002 all parameters of the model are\ninferred from the first block \u0001with 30 000 points\u0002 of station-\nary dynamics; \u0001ii\u0002 for all other blocks of data, we use ac-\nquired information to fix the model parameters constant at\nthe inferred values, and track in time only variations of the\ncontrol parameters \u0001i. Each block of data \u0001except the first\none\u0002 contains 12 000 points and has a time length t\u00120.34 s.\nThe time traces of the unknown variables qi\u0001t\u0002 are recon-\nstructed at every step using Eqs. \u000117\u0002 as explained above.\nThe inferred time evolution of the control parameters \u0001i is\ncompared with its true variation in Fig. 10. It is evident from\nthe figure that the method allows us to infer the unknown\nconstant parameters of the model, and then also to use this\ninformation to track in time the nonstationary control param-\neters of the system with a time resolution of the order of\n0.3 s.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, we have explored the performance of the\nBayesian inferential framework for nonstationary dynamics\nthat we introduced in paper I \u00036\u0004 in relation to physiological\napplications.

Our goal was to see whether we\ncould track on-line the control parameters \u0001i of the model,\ngiven that these can vary with correlation time \u0007cor\n\u000e500 ms. It was assumed that the slow recovery variables of\nthe FHN oscillators were unavailable for measurement and\nthat the correlation time of all other unknown parameters of\nthe model was of the order of 5 s. We have established that\nthe method does indeed facilitate on-line tracking of \u0001i with\na time resolution \r0.3 s. This was achieved by embedding\nthe fast on-line tracking of the control parameters within a\nBayesian learning framework for the more slowly varying\nparameters of the system with a time resolution \r1 s.\nWe showed that the time resolution of the method is de-\ntermined by the eigenvalues of the matrix \u0005\u02c6 \u22121=D\u02c6 \u0001\u0006\u02c6 k\n\u22121\n, and\ntherefore depends essentially on the choice and scale of the\nbase functions. Note that, while the eigenvalues of D\u02c6 are\nintrinsic to the system, the choice and scale of the base func-\ntions can be controlled by the researcher. Specifically, we\ndemonstrated that by accumulating a priori information\nabout slowly varying model parameters, one can enhance the\ntime resolution of the control parameters by an order of mag-\nnitude.\nSeveral limitations of the method should be borne in mind\nin adapting it to any particular application. As we have al-\nready mentioned, fast online applications require that mea-\nsurement noise be small. In addition, it was assumed that the\nequations for the hidden variables are linear and determinis-\ntic. The latter limitations can be removed, at least partially,\nby writing the equation for the hidden variables in the more\ngeneral form q\u02d9= f\u0001q\u0002+g\u0001y\u0002, where the homogeneous equa-\ntion q\u02d9= f\u0001q\u0002 is integrable and the nonlinear function of the\nmeasurable variable g\u0001y\u0002 is arbitrary. One can then proceed\nin exactly the same way as described in the present paper.\nFurthermore, the method can be extended to encompass the\ncase of an integrable stochastic differential equation for the\nhidden variables. To do so, a stochastic integral must be\nadded to the right-hand sides of the equations of reduced\ndynamics. Finally, the method can be applied to the case in\nwhich the dynamics of the system jumps at random between\ndifferent states, as, for example, in gating dynamics. Note,\nhowever, that if the different states are characterized by dif-\nferent dynamical models, then the solution of the inference\nproblem can be obtained more generally within the frame-\nwork of a hybrid probabilistic approach, as will be described\nin more detail elsewhere. We note that the method is also\nuseful when the low-dimensional dynamics is only a rough\napproximation to the actual multidimensional complex dy-\nnamics of the system. The latter situation is often the case in\nphysiological and aerospace applications \u000321,22\u0004.\nWe conclude, therefore \u0001see also \u00036\u0004\u0002, that the results ob-\ntained are of broad interdisciplinary interest. They were re-\ncently shown to be particularly useful in medical applica-\ntions \u000320\u0004 and for the development of prognostics and\ndiagnostics techniques in aerospace applications \u000321,22\u0004. The\nmethod can readily be extended to encompass systems with\nmultiplicative and colored noise, and efforts toward these\nends are already in progress.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to the Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council \u0001UK\u0002 and NASA for financial support, and\nto A.
