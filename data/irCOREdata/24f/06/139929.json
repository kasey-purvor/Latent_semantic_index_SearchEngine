Coatings of thickness of order 100 nm, deposited \nusing the Langmuir Blodgett [1], electrostatic self-assembly [2] and dip coating [3] \ntechniques have been shown to have a significant influence on the transmission spectrum of \nan LPG. The effect has been analyzed theoretically [5, 6, 7]\n \nand has been exploited to modify \nthe response of LPGs to surrounding refractive index [7, 8] and to demonstrate pH [9], copper \n[10], humidity [11], chloroform [12] and DNA damaging materials [13]. \nTo date, experimental studies of the effect of nanostructured coatings on an LPG\u2019s \ntransmission spectrum have been limited to the monitoring of the attenuation bands \ncorresponding to 1st order coupling from the core to cladding modes. This paper reports on \nthe evolution with increasing coating thickness of the attenuation bands corresponding to the \n2nd order coupling between core and cladding modes, which may offer new sensing \ncapabilities. The 2nd order coupling attenuation bands are shown to exhibit a high sensitivity \nto the thickness of the coatings, and onset of the highest sensitivity was observed to occur for \nthinner coatings than were required for the 1st order coupling attenuation bands. The \nobservation of dual attenuation bands that exhibit sensitivities of different sign to increasing \nfilm thickness is also discussed. Further observations on the 1st order coupling attenuation \nbands are also reported within this paper, which support and extend the observations made by \nDel Villar et al in [14] and in the theoretical treatment of [5]. \n2. Background \nLPGs are a relatively new class of fibre optic device that offer exciting properties for optical \nsensing applications [15]. An LPG is an UV induced periodic modulation of the refractive \nindex of the core of an optical fibre, with a period in the range 100 \u03bcm - 1000 \u03bcm. The small \ngrating wave-vector of an LPG allows the phase matching of forward propagating modes of \nthe core and the cladding.  Efficient coupling between the core and cladding modes occurs \nonly where there is significant overlap between the electric field profiles of the modes. Thus \nfeatures corresponding to coupling a from the guided core mode to a discrete set of the HE1,x \ncladding modes (x=2,4,6..) appear in the transmission spectrum of the fibre. These result from \nthe large attenuation of the cladding modes, which generates a series attenuation bands in the \ntransmission spectrum of a fibre containing an LPG, centered at discrete wavelengths that are \ngoverned by the phase matching expression [16].  \n ( )\n2,4,6..x ;  )()( =\n\u039b\u2212\n=\nN\nnn xcladcore\nx\u03bb  \n(1) \n#84599 - $15.00 USD Received 28 Jun 2007; revised 13 Sep 2007; accepted 22 Sep 2007; published 26 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 1 October 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 20 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13097\n  \nWhere \u03bb(x) represents the wavelength at which coupling occurs to the HE1,x modes, ncore is the \neffective refractive index of the mode propagating in the core of the fibre, ncladd(x)  is the \neffective index of the HE1,x cladding mode, \u039b is the period of the LPG and N is an integer \nrepresenting the order of diffraction. The efficiency of coupling to the EH modes is small, and \nthus attenuation bands corresponding to coupling to EH modes are in general not visible in \nthe transmission spectrum [5]. The interaction between core and cladding modes causes the \nexact form of the spectrum and the centre wavelengths of the attenuation bands to be sensitive \nto the local environment: temperature, strain, bend radius and refractive index of the medium \nsurrounding the fibre [17], with sensitivities governed by the differential sensitivities of the \ncore and cladding modes.  \nThe transmission spectrum of an LPG is shown in Fig. 1, exhibiting attenuation bands \ncorresponding to 1st order and 2nd order  coupling to the cladding modes. The attenuation \nbands have been labeled according to their associated cladding modes. The modes have been \nidentified by using the LP approximation to calculate the core and cladding mode dispersion. \nThe indices were then used in equation 1 to determine the coupling wavelengths and, noting \nthat the LP0x modes approximate to the HE1,x modes, the HE1,x modes were labeled in order.   \n 2nd order coupling of LPGs had received little attention to date. There has been a report of \nthe use of the differential sensitivities of the 1st and 2nd order-coupling attenuation bands to \ndiscriminate between the temperature and strain responses of the LPG [16]. Here the response \nof the 2nd order coupling attenuation bands to the deposition of a nanostructured coating is \ninvestigated\n \nFig. 1.

At these thicknesses the attenuation \nbands show a significant response to the optical properties of the coating [1, 2, 3].  The large \nsensitivity is attributed to a reorganization of the cladding modes which occurs when the \nthickness of the coating is sufficient such that it acts as a waveguide that is phase matched to \none of the cladding modes. In this region, the effective indices of the cladding modes change \nrapidly [5, 6, 7] resulting in the observed phenomenon.  \nIn a recent publication the evolution of the spectrum of a selection of 1st order coupling \nattenuation bands to increasing overlay thickness was presented by Del Villar et al [14]. The \ndata originally presented in [1], where the attenuation bands corresponding to the 1st order \ncoupling of an LPG of period 400\u03bcm fabricated in a boron-germanium co-doped \nphotosensitive optical fibre were monitored as the LPG was coated with \u03c9\u2212tricosenoic acid \nusing the LB technique, is re-plotted in Fig. 2 in the style of [14]. The results illustrate clearly \nthe now well-established form of the response, where the attenuation bands show a blue-shift \nin wavelength, the rate of change of wavelength accelerating as the thickness approaches a \nfew hundred nm, before the extinction ratio of the bands reduces. Thereafter the bands \nreappear, taking on the characteristics of the neighboring lower wavelength attenuation band. \n2.1 LP mode description \nAn analysis that approximates the cladding modes to LP modes [6], applicable when the \nindex contrast between the cladding and the coating is small, agrees well with the form of the \nbehaviour shown in Fig. 2. Within the transition region where the attenuation bands\u2019 \nextinction ratios reduce, the analysis predicts that the cladding modes undergo a \nreorganization as the coating becomes thick enough to guide one of the LP modes. The \neffective indices of the modes change rapidly,  with the effective index of the modes of order \nhigher than that guided by the coating taking on that of the immediate lower order LP mode, \ni.e. the effective index of the LP0,i (i=1,2,3..) cladding mode becoming that of the LP0,i-1  \ncladding mode.  \nFor coatings with large losses, the treatment in [6] predicts that a significant increase in \nthe imaginary part of the effective index of the cladding modes accompanies the transition to \nguidance by the coating of one the cladding modes. This acts to reduce the efficiency of the \ncoupling between the core and cladding modes, resulting in a reduction of the extinction of \nthe attenuation bands. As the thickness of the coating is increased further, the mode \nreorganization becomes complete, and the efficiency of coupling to the reorganized modes, \nand thus the extinction ratio of the attenuation bands, increases. The form of the curves \nrepresenting the wavelength shifts of the attenuation bands supports the assertion that this \ntakes place to compensate for the fact that one of the cladding modes becomes guided by the \noverlay, and that the mode reorganization allows the original mode distribution within the \ncladding to the recovered.  \n \n#84599 - $15.00 USD Received 28 Jun 2007; revised 13 Sep 2007; accepted 22 Sep 2007; published 26 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 1 October 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 20 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13099\n Fig. 2. Evolution of the optical spectrum of an LPG in response to an increase in the overlay thickness, for a \ncoating of refractive index 1.57. The LPG was fabricated in a photosensitive optical fibre with cut off \nwavelength 650nm. The gray scale represents the measured transmission, with white corresponding to \n100%, and black to 0%.  The attenuation bands are labeled according to the attenuation bands to which \ncoupling occurs, and the LP notation has been adopted to aid the discussion of the process provided in \nsection 2.1  \n \n2.2 Hybrid  mode description \nWhen the index contrast between the cladding and the coating is large, a hybrid-mode \napproach is adopted [5]. The hybrid-mode treatment predicts that, at the beginning of the \ntransition region, the electric field profiles and the mode effective indices undergo significant \nchanges. As the coating becomes sufficiently thick, the lowest order HE mode becomes \nguided by the coating. Associated with the onset of the guidance of the HE mode by the \ncoating is a reorganization of the cladding modes, such that the HE1,x mode profile and its \neffective refractive index evolve into that of the EH1,x-1 mode, and the EH1,x-1  takes on the \ncharacteristics of the HE1,x-2 mode. At the end of the transition region the lowest order EH \nmode becomes guided by the coating, and a further reorganization of the EH and HE modes \ntakes place, with the net effect that the HE1,x takes on the properties of the HE1,x-2 after \ntransition region.  Thus the transition is a two step process. \nIn terms of the extinction of the attenuation bands, on the first step of the transition region, \nas the HE modes take on the symmetry of the EH modes, the coupling efficiency and thus \nextinction ratio of the attenuation bands corresponding to core to HE cladding mode coupling \ndecrease. However, the EH modes that evolve into the HE mode symmetry increase their \ncoupling strength and associated attenuation bands appear within the spectrum. At the 2nd step \nof the transition region, this process reverses, with the EH cladding mode-associated \nattenuation bands disappearing, and the HE cladding mode-associated bands reappearing [5]. \nAn experimental observation of this effect is reported in this paper. \n3. Experiment \nAn LPG of length 40 mm and of period 400 \u03bcm was fabricated in Fibrecore SM750, a single \nmode optical fibre with cut-off wavelength 700 nm. The photosensitivity of the fibre was \nenhanced by pressurizing it in hydrogen for a period of 2 weeks at a pressure of 150 bar at \nroom temperature.  The LPG was fabricated by illuminating the fibres by the output from a \nfrequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG laser, operating at 266nm, through an amplitude mask. The \ntransmission spectrum of the optical fibre was recorded by coupling the output from a \n#84599 - $15.00 USD Received 28 Jun 2007; revised 13 Sep 2007; accepted 22 Sep 2007; published 26 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 1 October 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 20 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13100\ntungsten-halogen lamp to into the fibre, and analyzing the transmitted light using a fibre \ncoupled CCD spectrometer. The transmission spectrum is shown in Fig. 1.  \nThe transmission spectrum contains two sets of attenuation bands. The bands in the range \n800 nm to 1100 nm correspond to the 1st order coupling. The attenuation bands are labeled \ncorresponding the HE1,x cladding mode to which coupling takes place. The HE notation is \nused as it facilitates direct comparison with the theoretical analysis reported in [6]. Given the \ncharacteristics of the LPG and of the optical fibre, the core mode is phase matched to the first \n8 (HE1,2  - HE1,16) cladding modes, with seven of the associated attenuation bands appearing \nwithin the spectral range of the CCD spectrometer. The bands in the lower wavelength range, \n530 nm to 800 nm, correspond to 2nd order coupling to cladding modes. The 2nd order \ncoupling process allows phase matching of the core mode to a larger numer of cladding \nmodes. This can be predicted, as shown in Fig. 3 (a) and Fig. 3 (b), where equation (1) has \nbeen used to plot the relationship between the coupling wavelengths to each of the bands and \nthe period of the LPG. The data plotted in Fig. 3 was calculated using the LP approximation \nto calculate the dispersion of the core and cladding modes. The approximations made in the \nmodel and lack of information of the exact fibre parameters means that this approach provides \na qualitative model of the effects observed.  \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFig.  3.

The LB \ntechnique facilitates deposition of the material one molecular layer at a time onto a substrate. \nThe \u03c9-tricosenoic acid was spread from dilute chloroform solutions (0.1 mg mL\u22121) onto the \npure water subphase (conductivity 18M\u03a9cm) of one compartment of a Nima Technology \nModel 2410A LB trough, left for 20 min at 20 \u25e6C, and compressed at 0.5 cm2 s\u22121 (0.1% s\u22121 of \ntotal surface area). Deposition was achieved at a surface pressure of 30 m Nm\u22121 and a transfer \nrate of 8 mm min\u22121. The fibre containing the LPG was positioned vertically so its long axis \nwas aligned with the dipping direction and was alternately raised and lowered through the \nfloating monolayer at the air\u2013water interface to deposit the coating. Transmission spectra \nwere recorded after the deposition of each monolayer, with the LPG below and above the \nwater subphase for alternate layers. \n4. Results and discussion \nThe results are shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), where the gray scale image allows the \nevolution of the transmission spectrum with increasing coating thickness, with the LPG under \nand above the water subphase, respectively, to be seen clearly. The results show a number of \ninteresting features. \n 4.1 1st order coupling attenuation bands  \nThe transition from the HE1,x mode to the HE1,x-2 mode is illustrated by the continuous \nnature of the wavelength shift of the bands across the transition region, which corresponds to \na coating thickness range of approximately 250 nm - 390 nm with the LPG below the water \nsubphase and 325 nm to 455 nm above the water subphase for the 1st order coupling. The \ntransition for the 2nd order coupling takes place for smaller values of coating thickness, 150 \nnm \u2013 200 nm with the LPG below the water subphase and 200 nm - 325 nm with the LPG \nabove the water subphase. Note that the attenuation band depth is reduced considerably within \nthe transition region for the reasons discussed previously [5]. It is apparent that the transition \nregion onset occurs for smaller coating thickness when the LPG is below the water subphase, \nthat the transition onset occurs for a larger coating thickness with increase in cladding mode \norder, and that the transition occurs over a wider range of coating thicknesses for higher order \ncladding modes, as noted in [14]. \nFigure 4 shows that, for the 1st order coupling attenuation bands, a new spectral feature is \ngenerated within the transition region, which is believed to correspond to the transformed \nEH1,x-1 modes, predicted in [5]. This was noted in [14], but was not shown as distinctly as it is \nhere. The spectra recorded during the transition region are shown in more detail in Fig. 5. It \ncan be seen that the attenuation band corresponding to coupling to the HE1,8 mode disappears \nfrom the spectrum implying that this is the mode that is guided by the coating layer. \n \n \n#84599 - $15.00 USD Received 28 Jun 2007; revised 13 Sep 2007; accepted 22 Sep 2007; published 26 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 1 October 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 20 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13102\n (a) \n (b) \nFig. 4.

A similar effect was noted in [14], and is attributed to the \ntheoretical prediction that, for a coating with large losses, it is not necessarily the lowest order \nmode that is guided, and that the attenuation bands corresponding to coupling to cladding \n#84599 - $15.00 USD Received 28 Jun 2007; revised 13 Sep 2007; accepted 22 Sep 2007; published 26 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 1 October 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 20 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13103\nmodes of order lower than the mode that is guided by the overlay behave differently to those \nof higher order.  \n \nFig. 5.

This \ncorresponds to a two-step change in the effective indices of the cladding modes predicted in \n[5], with the first step corresponding the HE1,8 mode becoming guided by the coating, and the \nsecond to the EH1,9 cladding  mode becoming guided by the coating. \n \n \nFig. 6.

An interesting feature of the response reported here is that the width of the \ntransition region increases with increasing coating thickness and that it appears that the \nseparations of the transition regions are not uniform. The extinction of the EH-mode-\nassociated attenuation bands is also observed to increase for the 2nd and 3rd transition regions, \nas compared with the 1st.    \n4.2 2nd order coupling attenuation bands \nThe 2nd order coupling attenuation bands show a similar response to that of the 1st order \nbands, but the reduction in their extinction ratio within the first transition region is not so \npronounced. The existence of transformed EH modes in the transition region is indicated, but \nwith significantly reduced extinction compared with the 1st order coupling. The onset of the \ntransition region for the second order coupling bands occurs for thinner films. This may be \nattributed to the waveguide dispersion of the fibre, and also to the dispersion of the film, as \u03c9-\ntricosenoic acid exhibits absorption at around 400nm [19], which indicates an increasing \nrefractive index at the lower wavelengths. The 2nd transition region for the 2nd order \nattenuation bands begins sooner that that of the 1st order bands.  \nFigure 4 also reveals the generation of two new attenuation bands, which occurs at the end \nof the transition region at a wavelength of approximately 900nm. While these bands appear \nwithin the spectral region that has been associated with the 1st order coupling, they are in fact \nrelated to the 2nd order coupling. Initially degenerate, the new bands move in opposite \ndirections along the optical spectrum with subsequent increase in coating thickness. We \npropose that these dual attenuation bands both correspond to 2nd order coupling to the HE1,26 \ncladding mode.  \nDual attenuation bands corresponding to coupling to higher order cladding modes have \nbeen observed previously [20], and are explained by considering the differential propagation \nconstant, \u0394\u03b2,  \n( ))(2 xcladcore nn \u2212=\u0394 \u03bb\n\u03c0\u03b2  (2) \n  \nand its influence on equation 1. As the wavelength increases, the cladding mode effective \nindex decreases rapidly, an effect more pronounced for higher order cladding modes. When \nthe rate of change of the numerator of equation (2) exceeds that of the denominator, the \nrelationship between the resonant wavelength and the grating period (equation (1)) exhibits a \nturning point [16, 21]. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 where the plots show the relationship \nbetween period and coupling wavelengths for the 1st and 2nd order coupling to the cladding \nmodes. \nFigure 3 (b) predicts that, for a period of 380 nm, 2nd order coupling to the 13th cladding \nmode (equivalent to HE1,26) would occur at two wavelengths within the spectral region \nshown, giving rise to dual attenuation bands. Such bands have been shown previously to \nexhibit sensitivities to parameters such as bending, transverse load [21] and refractive index \n[20] that have opposite sign.  \nFigure 7 illustrates the predicted response of these curves to increasing cladding mode \neffective index. Figure 7 shows that increasing the refractive index of the material \nsurrounding the cladding, and thus increasing the effective indices of the cladding modes, \ncauses the curve corresponding to coupling to the 13th cladding mode to move in the direction \nindicated by the arrow. \n  \n#84599 - $15.00 USD Received 28 Jun 2007; revised 13 Sep 2007; accepted 22 Sep 2007; published 26 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 1 October 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 20 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13105\n Fig. 7. The relationship between the grating period and the wavelength at which 2nd order coupling occurs \nto the 13th cladding mode (equivalent to HE1,26)  when the fibre is assumed to be immersed in air (dashed \nlines) and in a material of refractive index 1.43 (solid lines). \n  \nThe turning point for the 2nd order coupling to the 13th mode  (equivalent to HE1,26) is shown \nin Fig. 7, illustrating that, for the period of the LPG used in these experiments (400 \u03bcm), \nwhen the LPG is uncoated there is no coupling to this mode. However, as the effective index \nof the cladding mode increases, as in response to the deposition of the coating, the emergence \nof dual attenuation bands is predicted to occur. The two bands move in opposite directions \nalong the optical spectrum as the external index increases, matching the experimental \nobservations. The asymmetry of the experimentally observed responses of the dual bands to \nincreasing coating thickness may be a result of the asymmetry of the curve in Fig. 7, and of \nthe dispersion introduced by the coating within the transition region. It is anticipated that, \ncould the appropriate spectral range be observed from the full range of 1st order coupling \nattenuation bands, a similar effect would be observed. Figure 6 shows that the appearance of \nthe dual attenuation bands repeats for each transition cycle. \nThe two faint bands, which lie within the 600nm to 800 nm wavelength range in Fig. 4, \nappear to have a similar form to the dual bands discussed above, and may correspond to third \norder coupling to  cladding modes with such  turning points. \n5. Summary \nAn experimental investigation of the behaviour of the attenuation bands corresponding to the \nLPG induced first and second order coupling between core and cladding modes in response to \nincreasing coating thickness has been reported. The results confirm many of the theoretical \npredictions for the response of the LPG transmission spectrum, including the two step \ntransition, and the transformation of the mode profile from HE to EH and back to HE that \noccurs as part of the mode reorganization process that takes place in the transition region.     \nThe 2nd order coupling attenuation bands show a similar behaviour to the first order bands \nbut respond to thinner films, a result of a combination of the effects of waveguide dispersion \n#84599 - $15.00 USD Received 28 Jun 2007; revised 13 Sep 2007; accepted 22 Sep 2007; published 26 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 1 October 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 20 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13106\nand the increased refractive index of the \u03c9\u2212tricosenoic acid coating at lower wavelengths. \nThe evolution of a dual attenuation band that appeared within the optical spectrum during the \ntransition region has been observed and explained.  \n \n \n \n \n#84599 - $15.00 USD Received 28 Jun 2007; revised 13 Sep 2007; accepted 22 Sep 2007; published 26 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 1 October 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 20 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13107\n"}
