This study, conducted in a rural English location, finds that trust and confidence in \nthe police is shaped not by sentiments about risk and crime, but by evaluations of the values and \nmorals that underpin community life. Furthermore, to garner public confidence the police must be \nseen first to typify group morals and values and second to treat the public with dignity and \nfairness. All these findings are consistent with the perspective that people are Durkheimian in \ntheir attitudes towards crime, policing and punishment \u2013 a perspective developed here in this \npaper. \n \n \n \n \nKey words \nPublic confidence in policing; fear of crime; neo-Durkheimian perspective \n \n \n \n \n \n 1\nA recent study found that fear of crime was driven by a particular form of social perception (Jackson, \n2004). People judged a range of things in their community as hostile to social order, and by linking \nsuch symbols of breakdown with the threat of victimisation, people used \u2018crime\u2019 as a neo-\nDurkheimian marker of moral structure. The fear of crime emerged as a lay seismograph of social \norganisation and control, expressing and distilling a whole set of evaluative activity. \nThis paper continues the neo-Durkheimian theme. It analyses the same data reported in \nJackson (2004). But the focus now includes trust and confidence in the police. The study presented \nhere finds that public confidence in policing is driven not by worries about falling victim of crime but \nby concerns about social cohesion. Crime and disorder challenge the moral structure of society and \npeople look to agents of social control to channel group outrage, defend group values, and re-establish \nmoral norms. The public loses confidence in the activities of the police when community values and \nnorms are seen to be deteriorating, not when they worry about their own safety. This study, together \nwith Jackson (2004), consequently finds that fear of crime and public confidence in policing are both \ndriven by lay diagnoses of social and moral order. \nThe study also shows that people judge whether the police are representatives of community \nvalues and morals (Sunshine & Tyler, 2003a). To the extent that the police are felt by members of the \npublic to represent these values (actively defending community morals felt to be under threat), the \npublic has confidence in police effectiveness. Moreover, the study demonstrates that procedural \njustice is a significant driver of identification with the police: one way that the police communicate \nthe values they espouse is through the dignity and fairness with which they treat people (e.g. Sunshine \n& Tyler, 2003b; Tyler & Huo, 2002). \nOverall, this paper contributes to a surprisingly thin British research literature on public \nconfidence in policing. It also contributes to current debates about the role of the police. The research \nfinds that people judge the police in ways that are less about \u2018fear\u2019 and the threat of crime, and more \nabout moral order and social stability (see Girling et al., 2000). Moreover, in this rural community at \nleast, the police are not seen as just another public service: residents want them to typify and defend \nthe value structure of their community, as well as treat the public with fairness and dignity. This \nfinding is consistent with the work of Garland (1990), Loader (1997) and Loader & Mulcahy (2003), \nas well as research on lay attitudes towards crime and punishment (Tyler & Boeckmann, 1997; \nSunshine & Tyler, 2003a).  \nThere are four sections to the article. The first outlines evidence on a neo-Durkheimian \nperspective to public attitudes about crime and punishment. The second introduces the topic of public \nconfidence in policing. The third presents the data. The fourth draws implications for both neo-\nDurkheimian analyses of public sentiment and policing policy. \n \nA neo-Durkheimian sociology of deviance \nRock (1998) offers a Popperian treatment of recent Durkheimian approaches to deviance and social \ncontrol: he presents the argument for such treatments of rules and the boundary-defining work of \ninstitutions of social control; he provides a particularly strong and eloquent account; he then \nsystematically questions their foundations.  \nThe neo-Durkheimian sociology of deviance, he argues, has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s. \nThe thesis was this.  \n \n\u2018The very symbolic boundaries of a society were thought to emerge in the policing of \ndeviance, their features taking form in the dialectic between law-enforcers and \nlawbreakers, insiders and outsiders, us and them. Deviants provided the symbolic \ncontrasts and antitheses that disclosed the form and structure of society, capitalists \ndefining communists; radicals defining moderates; the poor defining the rich; the \ndisreputable defining the respectable; and homosexuals defining heterosexuals\u2019 (Rock, \n1998: 586).  \n \n 2\nTheorists believed crime, deviance and control \u2018 . . . convey[ed] important symbolic representations \nof the cultural, ideological and social order which they themselves help to generate and sustain\u2019 (p. \n588). Law courts are a case in point: they \u2018\u2026define rules, trace boundaries and express public \nabhorrence of deviation\u2019 (p. 589). Courts thus define boundaries of what is acceptable and \nrespectable, and what is not. \nYet one can marshal the example of the law courts to refute the thesis. For Rock (p. 592): \u2018 . . \n. [the neo-Durkheimian sociology of deviance] is attractive and plausible but, unfortunately, it also \nappears to rest on rather flimsy conceptual and empirical foundations.\u2019 Mundane justice is just that: \nmundane. It operates within \u2018an artfully-contrived and neat legal facsimile . . . [that] is designed to \nimpose a clarity and order which can usefully dispel conceptual and moral confusion\u2019  (p. 594). The \nneo-Durkheimian perspective is: \u2018. . . At best [a] radical idealization with only a problematic \ncorrespondence to the ambiguities, anomalies, flux, contradictions, hetereogeneity and uncertainties \nof what might be called a wider cultural and symbolic reality of rules and rule-observance.\u2019 (p.594).  \nAn intriguing debate, to be sure. But the contention of this paper is not that institutions \nfunction and shape society in ways consistent with Durkheim\u2019s theory. Rather, it is that public \nperceptions of crime, punishment and policing can be partly explained by neo-Durkheimian theory. \nThe argument is that crime is seen by a variety of publics to reveal the structure and edges of society, \nto demarcate the respectable from the disrespectable, to communicate the strength of social bonds and \nthe regulation of values, morals and norms. Public concerns about crime are therefore wrapped up in \nconcerns about community cohesion, in people\u2019s sense of place (Girling, et al., 2000), in what seems \nto threaten the \u2018moral architecture\u2019 of their community (Garland, 2001a: 749). \nMoreover, the argument is that public confidence in policing is shaped by lay evaluations of \ncohesion and moral consensus. The public look to the police to defend and reassert the moral \nstructure when that structure is felt to be under threat (Tyler & Boeckmann, 1997; Loader & \nMulcahy, 2003; Girling et al., 2000). Symbolic concerns about social order may be just as important \nin driving public confidence in policing as worries about falling victim of crime (Loader, 1997; \nGarland, 1990). People may look to the police to typify and represent community values (Sunshine & \nTyler, 2003a).  \nBefore presenting the findings, let us first outline existing evidence for a neo-Durkheimian \nanalysis of public opinion on crime.  \n \nPublic perception of crime: A neo-Durkheimian perspective \nTwo puzzles have dominated criminological debate on the fear of crime. On the one hand, fear is, at \nbest, only moderately related to statistical estimates of the risk of crime. On the other hand, disorder \nand incivilities invoke anxieties about crime. Some say fear is based on a misunderstanding of the \nreality of crime. Others say that fear is a response to disorderly aspects of the social world. Nearly all \nagree it has a major impact on individuals and communities.1  \n Bridging social and individual levels of analysis, Jackson (2004) investigated experiential and \nexpressive aspects of fear. The psychological edge was seen in vulnerability and subjective threat \nappraisal explaining why some people worried about personal crime, while others did not.2 The \n                                                 \n1 Recent research has raised the possibility that standard research tools actually exaggerate the fear of crime \nproblem, in the sense that worry about crime may be less frequent than commonly thought (Farrall et al. 1997; \nFarrall & Gadd, 2004; see Farrall, 2004 and Hough, 2004a). Moreover, some people\u2019s responses to risk may be \nbetter characterised as functional fear so arguably does not constitute a social problem (Jackson, 2006a) \u2013 \nrespondents report being worried about crime, but careful probing reveals that worry for them is more of a \nproblem-solving activity than something that eats into their well-being \u2013 a risk management strategy or natural \ndefense against crime. These individuals take precautions against crime, feel less at risk, worry less frequently \nas result \u2013 and crucially, do not believe their quality of life is damaged.  \n2 The study found that people worried about crime if they felt it was likely, the impact would be serious and \nthey had little control over its occurrence. A personal sense of vulnerability may thus be at the heart of fear (cf. \n 3\nsociological edge was seen in risk perception being shaped by everyday evaluations of social order \nand control. In this quiet, relatively crime-free rural area, people attached a threat of crime to certain \nindividuals, behaviours, and social conditions.  \nBut not everyone saw problems of disorder and cohesion; not everyone linked disorder and \nyoung people hanging around with crime. Harcourt (2001) reminds us that categories of order and \ndisorder are not fixed and natural, but are products of historical, social and cultural processes. Jackson \n(2004) found that wider social values shaped the social meaning of disorder and its links to \ncommunity aspects. Respondents who held more authoritarian views about law and order, who were \nconcerned about a long-term deterioration of community, were more likely to perceive disorder in \ntheir environment. People with these values were more likely to link these physical cues to problems \nof social cohesion and the incidence and threat of crime. \nThese findings accord with some important qualitative work (Girling et al., 2000; Innes, \n2004a; Tulloch et al. 1998; Evans et al., 1996; Taylor et al., 1996) and echo Stuart Hall\u2019s claim that \ncrime reflects and refracts a range of anxieties and conflicts. They are consistent with the idea that \nfear of crime is displayed not as a singular fear but as a comprehensive pattern of interpretation of the \nsurrounding social world \u2013 a way of seeing and a way of feeling.3 Crime may serve as a vivid marker \nof the breakdown of social organisation and moral norms; things seen to be hostile to social order \nthen become associated with crime. As Durkheim points out, crime acts as a proxy for the status of \nsociety\u2019s underlying moral order and social organisation. Emotions about crime partly arise as a \ndesire to re-establish rules and behaviour that underpin social organisation, and censure those who \nviolate the rules (see Elster, 2004: 155). \u2018Crime may be one of those forms of \u201cdanger on the borders\u201d \nwhich gives form to a community\u2019s sense of itself . . .\u2019 (Girling et al., 2000: 16) \nThis expressive and symbolically charged aspect of fear of crime \u2013 where fear discloses \nconcerns about social stability and breakdown \u2013 may remind some of the work of Tyler & \nBoeckmann (1997). Studying public support for the Three Strikes and You\u2019re Out initiative in \nCalifornia, which, passed in 1994, mandated life in prison for those convicted of three crimes, Tyler \n& Boeckmann contrasted an instrumental model \u2013 where public concern is rooted in judgements \nabout the severity of the crime problem, anxieties about falling victim, and the sense of \nineffectiveness of the CJS \u2013 with a symbolic model, rooted in the moral consequence of rule-breaking \nbehaviour. The symbolic model suggests that rule-breaking are an affront to shared values and norms, \nand people wish to punish in part because punishment reasserts community commitment to those \nvalues. Tyler & Boeckmann (1997: 240) explain:  \n \n\u2018This approach focuses on the \u201csymbolic\u201d meaning of rule breaking. It links reactions to rule \nbreaking to concerns about social conditions and to judgments about cohesiveness, that is, to \npublic concerns about the nature and strength of social bonds within the family, the \ncommunity, and society. In other words, it suggests that people want to punish rule breakers \nbecause rule-breaking behavior poses a threat to the moral cohesion of society and because \npunishment reasserts social values and the obligation to obey social rules.\u2019 \n \nSupport for the Three Strikes and You\u2019re Out initiative was most strongly linked to \njudgements about social conditions and to underlying social values. Concerns about crime and the \n                                                                                                                                                       \nKillias, 1990, Warr, 1987). For further thoughts on the psychology of risk please see Jackson (2006b) and \nJackson et al. (2006). \n3 The paper also speculated that for some people fear of crime is purely expressive. There is early evidence that \npeople say they are worried about crime in a survey context yet have not recently worried about falling victim \n(Farrall & Gadd, 2004; Jackson et al., in press; Farrall et al., 2006). These people may use the language of \n\u2018worry\u2019 and \u2018crime\u2019 to express a whole host of concerns and anxieties about crime and things connected with \ncrime (Girling et al. 2000; Hollway & Jefferson, 1997; Taylor, 1995; Evans et al. 1996), in the absence of \nconcrete worries about safety and vulnerability. \n 4\ncourts had very little influence on punitiveness. The authors concluded:  \n \n\u2018\u2026surface concerns about the crime problem and\/or the legal system do not seem to be the \ncentral preoccupations of the public and do not drive their policy judgements . . . People are not \nmotivated primarily by their concerns about tangible risks. This finding accords with the findings \nof the \u201csymbolic politics\u201d literature, which have demonstrated that personal concerns and fears \nhave little impact on policy judgements in a variety of arenas.\u2019 (Tyler & Boeckmann, 1997: 240).  \n \nThus, citizens express punitive attitudes not because they fear for their own safety, but \nbecause they are concerned about the moral structure of society. Punishment reaffirms the authority \nof society\u2019s moral structure, and legal authorities channel group outrage and represent the group\u2019s \nmoral values. When social cohesion is believed to be waning, people look for a stronger response \nfrom legal authorities.  \n \nPublic confidence in policing \nThe legitimacy of the police is currently attracting considerable interest in policy circles and the \nsocial sciences (Hough, 2003, 2004b, 2006; Tyler, 2006; Reiner, 2006). Hough (2003: 146-147) puts \nthe problem thus: \u2018 . . . the police function depends critically on the authority that the police can \ncommand, rather than the force that they can deploy as a last resort.\u2019 A police force that fails to secure \npublic trust and establish its legitimacy simply does not function effectively (Hough & Roberts, \n2004). Legitimacy can rest on fair procedures and fair outcomes (Tyler, 2004, Hough, 2006) or on the \nbelief that the criminal justice system defends and expresses foundational values. Legitimacy may \neven have a more tenuous basis, being \u2018 . . . fraught and constantly subject to negotiation and \ndefinition, given the intimate relationship between policing, conflict and, ultimately, violence\u2019 \n(Reiner, 2006: 4). \nIn Britain, public confidence in policing has become a short-hand for trust, legitimacy and \nconsent, and there is considerable evidence that such public confidence has been falling steadily over \nthe past few decades. For example the British Crime Survey shows a steady decrease in the \nproportion of respondents who judge their local police to be doing a very good or fairly good job, \ndropping from 90% in 1982 to 75% in the financial year 2002\/2003 (Nicholas & Walker, 2004). \nPublic support and cooperation may suffer as a result (Tyler & Huo, 2002; Sunshine & Tyler, 2003b). \nReiner (1992, 2000) provides the most influential thesis on the historical trajectory of police \nlegitimacy in Britain. According to his analysis, the police have gone from the \u2018sacred\u2019 (a Golden \nimage of a ordered and settled England where the police held iconic status) to the \u2018profane\u2019 (yet \nanother public service). Where once the police occupied an iconic and identity-bearing status of \nBritish life, public confidence is now \u2018 . . . tentative and brittle . . . to be renegotiated case by case\u2019 \n(Reiner, 2000: 162). \nA number of explanations for changes in the legitimacy of the police have been proposed \n(e.g. Loader & Mulcahy, 2003; Hough, 2003; Lowe, 2002; Reiner, 2000). First, the past few decades \nhave seen massive changes in society. Consider transformations in the political economy. The 1970s \nand early 1980s saw soaring inflation, rising unemployment and increasing levels of industrial and \nsocial conflict. The police were often called upon in particular moments of discord: recall the miners\u2019 \nstrikes for instance (McCabe et al. 1988). Tense and troubled relations have also developed between \nthe police and particular communities which are often structurally excluded. Consider also changing \nvalues and expectations \u2013 less deference to authority perhaps springs first to mind. Society has also \nbecome more diverse, producing a greater variety of expectations from different communities (Lowe, \n2002): how, in an increasingly individualistic and pluralistic society, can the police hope to operate as \nan \u2018effective symbol of a unitary order\u2019 (Reiner, 1992: 779)?  \nSecond, the police service itself has changed. From a parochial and local set of police forces \nto a complex bureaucratic organisation, the public may see the police as less visible and accessible \nthan they once were (Hough, 2003). Equally, a series of scandals have shaped public attitudes \n 5\ntowards the fairness and integrity of the police: well-publicised cases of corruption and abuse of \nrights over the years have surely damaged their reputation (Reiner, 2000; Loader & Mulcahy, 2003).  \nThird, crime has increased since the Second World War (only decreasing from the mid 1990s \nonwards). The public hold the police partly to account for this, with crime moving from a problem \nthat afflicted the poor to become a daily consideration for many (Garland, 2001b). Liberal \nsensibilities about the seriousness of crime as a problem were dented in the 1970s as victimisation \nbecame a prominent fact for the middle-classes. Increasing direct and indirect experience, the mass \nmedia raising the salience of crime and \u2018institutionalising\u2019 public concern, and the growing visibility \nof signs of crime\u2014in the form of physical incivilities, such as vandalism, and social incivilities, such \nas groups of intimidating youths hanging around in the street\u2014all helped to bring crime and the risk \nof victimisation into people\u2019s everyday lives. As Garland (p. 153) puts it: \u2018 . . . rising crime rates \nceased to be a statistical abstraction and took on a vivid personal meaning in popular consciousness \nand individual psychology.\u2019  \nThese analyses are unmistakeably influential within British criminology, providing a range of \nperspectives on public confidence and legitimacy. Yet few studies have contributed by empirically \ntesting why public confidence differs between groups and changes over time. Large-scale research is \nneeded that goes beyond asking people to tick the \u2018police are doing a good job\u2019 or \u2018police are doing a \nbad job\u2019 box (see Loader & Mulcahy, 2003: 35). We need work that strives for causal explanations, \nthat accounts for the phenomenon in action (Goldthorpe, 2000), that identifies the generative \nprocesses that underpin trust and confidence. \n \nPopular sentiments towards policing \nThere are a number of theoretical and qualitative studies on the cultural significance of policing that \ntheoretically informed quantitative research can build upon. Garland\u2019s (1990) work on the role of \npunishment in society is the most sustained and successful resuscitation of Durkheimian themes in \nrecent criminological scholarship. It was also the point of departure for Loader (1997) and Loader & \nMulcahy\u2019s (2003) analysis of the cultural significance and emotional appeal of the police. Loader \n(1997: 7) argues: \n \n\u2018 . . . policing in contemporary western societies comprises for the most part a \nbureaucratic, professionalized and goal-directed set of practices. But this does not mean \nthat it is not also shaped and legitimated by various structures of social belief and affect. \nPolicing like punishment is embroiled in, and animated by, a set of cultural mentalities and \nsensibilities. Policing too communicates meaning and plays its part in the creation of \nculture. And just as with punishment, the way we police, represent policing to ourselves, \nand position it within an overall sense of order, makes a difference to both the construction \nof individual subjectivities, and the quality and character of social relations.\u2019  \n \nAccording to this perspective, lay dispositions disclose policing as a \u2018category of thought and affect\u2019 \n(Loader & Mulcahy, 2001: 39, italics in original) that is not only linked to narratives of social change \nbut also to \u2018the viability of the state and the security of its citizens\u2019 (p. 39). The cultural category of \n\u2018the police\u2019 speaks to anxiety and hope, conflict and order, and the authority and social control that \nbinds social life. Echoes here of the qualitative and ethnographic study of Girling et al. (2000) which \nfound that sentiments towards policing were based less on fear of crime and more on people\u2019s sense \nof place and the things hostile to the social order of that locale.  \n Such work sketches out the beginnings of a cultural sociology that stresses the meaning of \ncrime and policing. It reminds us that public confidence may be intertwined with more fundamental \nconcerns about order and disorder, about the values and morals that underpin social life.  \n \nThe study \n \n 6\nTesting a neo-Durkheimian analysis of public confidence in policing \nThis study tests and compares an instrumental and a neo-Durkheimian model of public confidence in \npolicing on a sample drawn from a rural part of England. The instrumental model predicts that fear of \ncrime erodes trust and confidence in the police. When people are worried about becoming a victim of \ncrime, confidence suffers because people look to the police for protection. If people are anxious about \ncrime, they will judge the police as ineffective in dealing with crime and engaging with the \ncommunity.  \nThe neo-Durkheimian model expects the correlation between fear of crime and public \nconfidence to decrease once concerns about social cohesion and order are statistically controlled for. \nIn other words, individuals are more satisfied with the police response not when they fear for their \nown safety, but when they believe that their community is morally deteriorating (Girling et al., 2000). \nThis model proposes that the police are viewed as prototypical representatives and authorities of the \ncommunity so individuals look to the police to strengthen moral structures. It follows that when signs \nof social breakdown are evident, the police will be judged to be ineffective at dealing with crime. As \nLofthouse (1996: 44) argues: \u2018the police are not just the simple protectors of the community, they are \nconstantly and actively engaged in the construction and reconstruction of the moral and social order\u2019 \n(emphasis added). \nThe model also predicts that moral identification with the police is important (Sunshine & \nTyler, 2003a). Social identity approaches suggest that people use their membership in groups to \ndefine themselves and assess their self-worth (Hogg and Abrams, 1988; Hogg, 2002; Turner, 1999; \nTurner and Onorato, 1997). Authorities should also be prototypical of the group, reflecting its values \n(Hogg, 2001; Hogg and Reid, 2001; Hogg and van Knippenberg, 2003). Therefore, public satisfaction \nwith the police is driven by individual judgements about whether the police embody community \nvalues and morals.  \nHowever, there is a complication. Social identity theory predicts that the more someone \nidentifies with their group (e.g. one\u2019s community) the more the prototypicality of the authority of that \ngroup (e.g. the police) is important (e.g. Hogg, 2001). Hogg (2001: 189) argues that: \u2018As group \nmembership becomes more salient, and members identify more strongly with the group, \nprototypicality becomes an increasingly influential basis for leadership perceptions.\u2019 To address this \nhypothesis we test two interaction effects. First, we predict that as identification with the community \nincreases, the importance of identification with the police is expected to increase (i.e. the association \nbetween identification and attitudes towards the effectiveness of the police increases).  \nSecond, as identification with the community increases, it is predicted that the importance of \nconcerns about social cohesion will decrease. Individuals derive their identify and seek status relevant \ninformation from group membership. A high status group member will likely be less concerned with \nthe prototypicality of group authorities and therefore issues of cohesion and disorder will not be \nparamount. However, those expressing lower levels of identification with the community will be \nmore attune with the prototypicality of group authorities and will therefore likely be more sensitive to \nsocial order and breakdown. \n Finally, consistent with the findings in Sunshine & Tyler (2003a), it is predicted that \nidentification with the police will be associated with perceptions of procedural justice or the belief \nthat the police treat people with respect, dignity, and fairness. If legal authorities gain cooperation by \nembodying the ethical and moral values of the group, how do they show that they have such values? \nOne answer is by treating the public fairly and with dignity. Rooted in social identity theory, Lind and \nTyler (1988) argue that group leaders, rules, norms, and values symbolically represent the group, and \nprovide identity relevant information to the individuals associated with the group. The manner in \nwhich group members are treated by their leaders communicates information to that individual about \ntheir status within the group. Rules governing group behavior and norms guiding authority conduct \nare indicative of the group's fundamental definitions of correct behavior for its members.  In the \ncontext of law enforcement, Lind and Tyler's (1988) relational model of authority of suggests that \nindividuals evaluate the manner in which the police exercise their authority as central to the impact \n 7\non opinion of the police because it reflects on an individual's social status and personal identity. Fair \ntreatment is of intrinsic importance to people and this information is gleaned from how authorities \ntreat subordinates.   In other words, authorities communicate that they represent normative group \nvalues by the manner in which they exercise their authority.  \n \n \nMethod \nSample \nData are from a single-contact mail survey of a randomly drawn sample of residents of seven sets of \ntowns and villages within a predominantly rural area in the North-East of England. According to the \n2001 Census, Tynedale has a population of 58,808. The vast majority was white (99.3% compared to \n90.9% across England). There was an equal gender mix (49% male, 51% female). There was also a \nsignificantly lower incidence of crime and disorder compared to the North East as a whole and to \nEngland and Wales more widely (as testified by police figures relating to the period of April 2000 to \nMarch 2001).  \nIn 2001, questionnaires were sent to 5,906 named individuals drawn from the 2001 Electoral \nRoll. Because of an arrangement with Royal Mail, those that that could not be delivered (e.g. where \nthe residents had moved) were returned to sender. There were 223 of these returns. A total of 1,023 \ncompleted questionnaires were received, leaving the response rate at 18.0%.4  \nThis low response rate has implications for generalisability. Of course, when considering the \nimpact, one begins by comparing known quantities of the sample and population. The socio-\ndemographic breakdown of the sample was close to that of the population of the area according to \nCensus data, albeit with a slight bias towards females and older individuals. But moreover, one \nworries about the representativeness of a sample particularly when one is estimating basic population \nattributes such as means or proportions. Relationships between constructs, as well as the measurement \nmodels in these structural equation models, are arguably less susceptible to low response rates. \nFollowing this logic, the study\u2019s findings\u2013 based on the estimation of measurement and structural \nelements of a number of models \u2013 may have greater validity than other studies that have low response \nrates but do not focus so heavily on relationships between variables. 5\nDetails of the measures of fear of crime and environmental perceptions (social and physical) \ncan be found in Jackson (2004) and Jackson (2005). It is important to note that the survey employed a \nsplit ballot: a random half received a version of the questionnaire that fielded questions about \nattitudes towards social change, law and order and authoritarianism (reported on in Jackson, 2004); \nthe other half received a version of the questionnaire that fielded questions about attitudes towards the \npolice (reported on here).  \n A range of individuals were sampled, many of whom had different perceptions of the same \nenvironment. By and large this design is rare in studies of the fear of crime and public confidence in \npolicing. Most studies sample across cities, regions or countries and do not analyze how different \nperceptions of the same environment play out. These differing perceptions were explained by \nrecourse to social-psychological and sociological processes.  \n \nMeasures \n                                                 \n4 462 (45.2%) were male and 528 (51.6%) were female, and 33 (3.2%) respondents did not state their gender. \nThere was consequently a slight bias towards females compared to Tynedale as a whole. The age distribution \nwas somewhat skewed towards older people (\u039c 55.46, SD 15.63, skewness -.13, kurtosis -.67). Of those who \nindicated their age (40 respondents refused), just over half were aged 55 or above (54.7%), and only around \none-tenth were between 18 and 34 (10.9%). According to the 2001 Census, this compares to the region as a \nwhole, where 40.5% are aged 55 or above, and 18.9% aged between 18 and 34. \n5 See Jackson (2004) for a fuller discussion of the implications of the low response rate.  \n \n 8\nTable 1 provides the wording of the indicators of the following theoretical constructs:  \n \n1 satisfaction with police engagement in the local community;  \n2 satisfaction with police effectiveness in dealing with crime;  \n3 extent to which the police are seen to treat people fairly and respectfully; and,  \n4 social identification \u2013 a judgement by the respondent of perceived similarity between their \nvalues and those of local police officers.  \n \nTable 1 also provides the valid per cent of respondents who were satisfied with each particular aspect \nof local policing, or who agreed with the attitude statements that regarded the police. A breakdown \nfor each item across gender and age groups is presented. But before we discuss these top-line \nfindings, a word or two about scaling. \n \nINSERT TABLE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) allows the a priori theoretical specification of a model \nof the latent construct(s) and indicators, and the empirical assessment of this model. Table 2 shows \nthat, for the measures of attitudes toward the police, each set of indicators adequately scaled in a one-\nfactor model. Appropriate items measured the (a) satisfaction with community engagement, (b) \nsatisfaction with dealing with crime, (c) extent to which the police are seen to people fairly and \nrespectfully, and (d) identification with the police. Each of the latent variables and relevant sets of \nindicators was empirically distinct \u2013 for instance, satisfaction with community engagement was not \nthe same as satisfaction with dealing with crime, even if they were somewhat correlated.6  \n \nINSERT TABLE TWO ABOUT HERE \n \nResults \n \nTop-line findings \nTable 1 shows descriptive statistics for the measures of attitudes towards the police. The biggest \nconcern of respondents was the extent to which the police patrol on foot in the local community. Just \nover half the sample was dissatisfied with the way the police engaged in this activity. Around one-\nquarter was dissatisfied with how the police got to know the community or made themselves available \nto the public. By contrast, only one-in-ten was dissatisfied with how the police met with schools and \ncommunity groups. Males were slightly more likely to be dissatisfied about each of these issues, as \nwere younger respondents. Those aged between 16-24 judged the police significantly more negatively \non each measure than older respondents.7  \nStreet crime was not an issue that provoked many negative evaluations of police actions: only \n7% were dissatisfied with how the police dealt with this form of crime. By contrast, between 17% and \n20% of respondents were dissatisfied with how the police dealt with anti-social behaviour, drink \ndriving and burglary. Again, males were more likely to evaluate the police negatively, as were \nyounger respondents. \nMost people felt that the police were fair and respectful in their dealings with the public. Only \n7% of respondents felt this was not the case. A slightly higher proportion opined that the police did \nnot clearly explain the reasons for their actions. Again, males were more likely to lack confidence in \npolice integrity and fairness. There was also a tendency for 16-24 year olds to lack confidence \ncompared with older age groups. \n                                                 \n6 For details of the successful validation of the fear of crime measures in this survey, see Jackson (2005). \n7 It is notable that this is predominantly the population whom the police control. One should not forget that the \npolice intimidate as well as reassure. \n 9\nThis pattern across gender and age groups was also evident in the extent to which people \nidentified with police officers (e.g. felt they shared values and views, and thought the police officers \nwould respect them). The vast majority of respondents identified with police officers, but between \none-in-five and one-in-four of those aged 16-24 felt that officers had different values and views to \nthemselves. \n \nThe instrumental model: Fear of crime and public confidence in the police \nFigure 1 summarises the results of a test of the instrumental model using structural equation \nmodelling. Most of this framework replicated the model presented and tested in Jackson (2004). The \ninstrumental model stated that environmental perceptions shaped beliefs about crime and risk \nperceptions, and these risk perceptions in turn shaped worries about crime. Here, the associations \nbetween worry about crime and two aspects of police attitudes were assessed. The first was \ndissatisfaction with police effectiveness in cutting crime, the second dissatisfaction with police \neffectiveness in engaging with the local community. The instrumental model predicted that worrying \nabout falling victim of crime was associated with feelings of dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of \nthe police in dealing with crime and in engaging with the community. \nThe fit of the model was good according to approximate-fit indices (RMSEA=.052, \nCFI=.982), but not according to tests of exact fit (\u03c7 2 1521, 604 df, \u03c1<.001), although a relative Chi \nSquare statistic of 2.5 is an acceptable fit according to Kline (1998). A moderate proportion of the \nvariance of \u2018worry about crime\u2019 was accounted for (36.2%) by perceptions of disorder, feelings of \ncontrol over the risk of victimisation, and estimates of the likelihood of victimisation (Figure 1). \nHowever, only 4.6% of the variance of dissatisfaction with police effectiveness in cutting crime was \nexplained by worry about crime (\u03b2=.22, \u03c1<.05): people who worried were more likely to be \ndissatisfied by the police response to crime than people who did not worry. Equally, 4.0% of the \nvariance of dissatisfaction with police effectiveness in engaging with the community was explained \nby worry about crime (\u03b2=.20, \u03c1<.05): people who worried were more likely to be dissatisfied by \npolice engagement than people who did not worry. \n \nINSERT FIGURE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nThe neo-Durkheimian model: Stage one  \nWorrying about crime had a small but significant effect on public confidence in policing therefore, \nwith confidence defined as attitudes towards police effectiveness. But did beliefs about crime, \nperceptions of incivilities, and perceptions of social cohesion play a bigger role in predicting public \nconfidence in policing? Moreover, was fear of crime and public confidence a function of concerns \nabout social order? In other words, once one took into account the association between environmental \nperceptions and police attitudes, was the association involving fear of crime and public confidence \nspurious? \nThis hypothesis can be tested using structural equation modelling but for simplicity\u2019s sake let \nus consider the results of multiple regression modelling. Table 3 shows the parameter estimates of \ntwo models, where the response variable was each type of public confidence and the explanatory \nvariables were: (a) worry about crime; (b) beliefs about crime rates; (c) perceptions of incivilities; \nand, (d) perceptions of social cohesion. Using exploratory factor analysis an index was created for \neach, where the factor scores from one-factor solutions were saved to create single variables (see \nTable 2 for results using CFA).  \n \nINSERT TABLE THREE ABOUT HERE \n \nHolding constant other variables, worry about crime was no longer a statistically significant \npredictor of dissatisfaction with police effectiveness (dealing with crime \u03b2=.09, \u03c1=.068; engaging \nwith the community \u03b2=.07, \u03c1=.053). Only the perception of social cohesion was associated with \n 10\ndissatisfaction (dealing with crime \u03b2=.37, \u03c1<.005, engaging with the community \u03b2=.25, \u03c1<.005). \nThis meant that instrumental worries about personal safety were not, in fact, the driver of \npublic confidence in policing. Feeling that one\u2019s local community lacked cohesion, social trust and \ninformal social control was much more important. Consistent with a neo-Durkheimian analysis, \nconcerns about social order went to the core of how people evaluated the police. This public did not \nfeel let down by the police because they felt vulnerable to victimisation. They felt let down because \ncohesion was low and they looked to the police to defend community morals and values that the \npublic felt to be in flux. This accords with Tyler & Boeckmann\u2019s (1997) finding that attitudes towards \npunishment in California were driven not by instrumental concerns about physical security, but by \nsymbolic concerns about social cohesion and moral consensus. \n \nThe neo-Durkheimian model: Stage two \nThis was an intriguing finding. But there was more. We examined two other public judgements: (a) \nthe extent to which people identified with the values and morals of police officers; and (b) whether \nthe police were seen to treat individuals with dignity and fairness. We hypothesised that judgements \nabout procedural justice (do the police treat people fairly?) had a strong influence on social \nidentification with the police. We simplified the model by dropping out all variables apart from \nperceptions of social cohesion. Figure 2 presents the model at hand.  \n \nINSERT FIGURE TWO ABOUT HERE \n \nAgain, the model fitted the data, at least according to approximate-fit indices (RMSEA=.049, \nCFI=.990). While the Chi-Square measure was not sufficient to indicate exact fit (\u03c7 2 552, 236 df, \n\u03c1<.001), a relative Chi-Square statistic of 2.3 was acceptable according to Kline (1998). \nDissatisfaction with police effectiveness (both in cutting crime and in engaging with the local \ncommunity) was associated with (a) not identifying with the police, (b) feeling that the police do not \ntreat people with fairness and dignity, and (c) judging there to be problems of social cohesion and \ntrust in the community. The biggest single factor was procedural justice \u2013 the partial regression \ncoefficient was .35 (\u03c1<.05) for each of the response variables. Yet social identification also played an \nimportant role (\u03b2=.26, \u03c1<.05 for each of the response variables), as did concerns about social \ncohesion (for effectiveness in cutting crime \u03b2=.25, \u03c1<.05; for effectiveness in engaging with the \ncommunity \u03b2=.15, \u03c1<.05). Together, these explanatory variables accounted for 39.7% and 34.9% of \nthe variance of the respective measures of public confidence in policing. \nAlso striking was the powerful correlation between public judgements about the fairness with \nwhich the police deal with the public and social identification with the police. More than half of the \nvariance of social identification (60.0%) was accounted for by the variance of attitudes towards \nprocedural fairness (\u03b2=.77, \u03c1<.05).  \nThis analysis showed a strong influence of identification with police values on satisfaction \nwith police effectiveness. We lean on social-psychological theory here to make sense of this finding. \nSocial identity theory (and work on the appraisal of authority) predicts that people judge the authority \nof a group largely on the basis of whether they embody the values and morals of that group. This was \nconsistent with our data: we found that the public wanted to identify with the morals and values that \nthe police embody, and wanted the police to actively express the morals and values of their \ncommunity (see Sunshine & Tyler, 2003).  \n \nCommunity identification: Some interaction effects \nFinally, we examined the role of community identification by assessing two interaction effects. \nRespondents were asked how much they identified with their community. Table 4 presents the \nparameter estimates of the model just tested, but this time estimated on three groups: those with low, \nmedium and high identification with their community. We hypothesised that as identification with the \ncommunity increased, so the importance of social identification increased, and equally, so the \n 11\nimportance of concerns about social cohesion decreased. \n \nINSERT TABLE FOUR ABOUT HERE \n \nThe results showed some support for both hypotheses, particularly in the contrast between \nlow and high identification. For those respondents with low levels of identification with the \ncommunity, social identification with the police and concerns about cohesion had moderate effects \n(\u03b2s ranged from .41 to .48). Contrast this with the results for those respondents with high levels of \nidentification: concerns about social cohesion had a smaller effect (\u03b2s .11 and .18) whereas social \nidentification with the police had a bigger effect (\u03b2s .60 and .63).  \nAs Hogg (2001) predicted, those with strong connections to a group judged the authorities of \nthat group on the extent to which they are prototypical representatives. Equally, because they felt \nembedded in the local community, they were less sensitive to concerns about social cohesion. By \ncontrast, those with low identification with the community were more likely to have low confidence \nbecause of their concerns about cohesion, not because of their lack of identification with the police. \n \nDiscussion \nThis paper contributes to a rather thin research literature on the processes that underpin public \nconfidence in policing. The study investigated the impact of fear of crime and environmental \nperception on trust and confidence. It also investigated the roles of identification with the values of \nthe police (Sunshine & Tyler, 2003) and attitudes towards the procedural justice of the police (Tyler, \n2004). These factors were organised within a neo-Durkhiemian framework that drew upon a social-\nidentity approach to authority (Sunshine & Tyler, 2003).  \nIn combination with Jackson (2004), this study found that fear of crime and public confidence \nin policing were both rooted in a particular form of social perception: each was associated with lay \nevaluations of social order and cohesion. Additionally, these lay evaluations were shaped by wider \nvalues and political attitudes regarding social change (Jackson, 2004). Moreover, respondents looked \nto the police to defend community values when they believed the moral structure to be under threat \n(not when they worried for their own safety).  The public wanted the police to be strong \nrepresentatives of their community and to defend the moral structure when it was seen to be under \nattack. Of special importance was how authorities communicated to citizens that they both embody \ncommunity values and seek to strengthen them.  It was suggested that this is achieved when officers \ntreat the public fairly and with dignity (Sunshine & Tyler, 2003b). To our knowledge, this is the first \nevidence on a connection between perceived police fairness and public confidence in policing in the \nUK (see Hough, 2006).  \nFor this rural community, the old-fashioned idea British \u2018bobby' \u2013 resonant of a more ordered \ncommunity, a symbol of benign authority and broader cultural significance \u2013 may still have purchase \ntherefore (see Girling et al. 2000; Loader & Mulcahy, 2003). The police were judged on the basis of \nwhich they exemplified and defended the moral structure of the community. Yet the importance of \npolice prototypicality depended on the degree to which people identified with their community. \nConsistent with social identity approaches (Hogg, 2001), as identification with the community \nincreased, so people judged police authority on the extent to which the police represented the values \nof the group. Conversely, as identification with the community increased, so the importance of \nperceptions of social cohesion and order decreased. \n But how specific was this result to a rural area with low levels of crime, disorder and fear-of-\ncrime? In areas with more crime and more incivility, will public confidence be driven instead driven \nby fear-of-crime and disorder? Work by Girling et al. (2000) shows the situated nature of public \nperceptions of crime. How will this account fare in large urban conurbations for example?  \nSome of the findings presented here replicate a study of New York City residents (Sunshine \n& Tyler, 2003), suggesting generalization may be possible. Though that study did not consider social \nperception and fear of crime, it did find a strong effect of moral identification. If the current study \n 12\nwere to be replicated in an urban environment, fear of crime and perceptions of anti-social behaviour \nmay well play larger roles. Moreover, moral identification with the police may be more complicated \nin areas of social and ethnic pluralism. In more atomised localities, identification may be a weak \nfactor because fewer people share values and individuals have lower levels of identification with their \ncommunity: they will thus care less about threats to the values of that group. But these are all \nempirical questions of course. The next step is to test certain aspects of the neo-Durkheimian model \non data from the British Crime Survey or other sources.  \n \nConclusions \n \n\u2019[Perhaps] people think about policing and private security in ways that have less to do \nwith \u2018risk\u2019 and \u2018fear of crime\u2019 and more to do with a sense of place \u2013 their own place, or \nother places \u2013 and with concern for that place\u2019s \u201cmoral architecture\u201d, its social status, \nand its distinctive \u201csecurity aesthetic\u201d.\u2019  \n(Garland, 2001: 749, in a review of Girling et al. 2000). \n \nCurrent policing policy seeks to decrease fear of crime and increase public confidence in policing. \nPartly this reflects the rising importance of \u2018reassurance\u2019, particularly with the emergence of the \n\u2018reassurance gap\u2019 between falling crime rates and public perceptions that crime is rising (see Innes, \n2004b; Millie and Herrington, 2005). This is evidenced by the Home Office including measures of \nreassurance in its Police Performance Assessment Framework or the inclusion of reassurance as the \nprimary objective in the National Policing Plan 2003-2006, which emphasizes increased contact and \nvisibility of the police (Dalgleish and Myhill, 2004). \n\u2018Neighbourhood policing\u2019 is the buzz-phrase for delivering reassurance and developing a \nmore citizen-focused police service. By 2008 the government intends that every area in England will \nhave neighbourhood policing teams in place. The aim of these teams is to provide a more visible and \naccessible police force, to increase police-resident contact, and to identify and tackle \u2018signal crimes\u2019 \nin partnership with the local community (Innes, 2004a, 2004b). As the Chief Commissioner of the \nLondon Metropolitan Police Service put it, neighbourhood policing tries to counteract the \n\u2018degradation of communal life\u2019. Anti-social behaviour and incivilities not only damage people\u2019s \nquality-of-life, they also present subjective environmental cues for the incidence of crime and the \npossibility of victimisation. By tackling the day-to-day nuisance issues that the local community \nidentify as the things that make them feel insecure, the police hope to reduce fear-of-crime and \nimprove public confidence. \nBut this study found that disorder did not influence public confidence in policing. Nor did \nfear-of-crime, once one controlled for concerns about social cohesion. Instead, worries about crime \nand confidence in policing were both shaped by judgements about cohesion, trust and moral \nconsensus. In consequence, engaging in narrow fear of crime reduction measures may not, in and of \nitself, improve public confidence. As Girling et al. (2000) found, people thought about policing in \nways that had little to do with \u2018risk\u2019 and \u2018fear of crime.\u2019 Moreover, they thought about policing in \nways less to do with disorder and more to do with the values and norms that sustain social life. Most \nimportantly, they looked to the police to be representative of community values and exercise their \npowers fairly.  \nIn this rural community, police strategies to reduce disorder may improve public confidence \nin policing. But not, we suspect, because disorder drives confidence. Rather, doing so might persuade \nmembers of the public that the police shares their concerns, that the police are a strong and active \nsymbol of the morals and values that underpin community life. This can be achieved by exercising \nauthority in a manner perceived to be fair (e.g. affording citizens with respect and dignity) and by re-\nengaging as an active, visible and accessible part of community life.  \n 13\nReferences \n \nBannister, J.
