These papers have been \ndivided into the following areas and are presented chronologically.  The reader may \nnotice some slight duplication of references in this review due to the literature falling into \none or more categories; 1) Ditchings \/ Crash investigations, 2) Component drop tests, 3) \nFull-scale drop tests, 4) Applications of numerical methods \/ methods development, 5) \nLatest developments. \nThe Water Impact Environment: A Critical Design Scenario \nThe specifications related to providing sufficient occupant (crew and troop) \nprotection in the event of a military helicopter accident is provided through MIL-\n2 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \nSTD1290A (Ref. 3) and the Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide (Refs. 4 through 8), \nwhich has been superseded by the Joint Service Specifications Guide in 1998 (Ref. 9).  \nHowever, these regulations do not specify any certification requirements for a water \nimpact case, as they deal primarily with hard and soft soil surfaces.  \nIn the event of a hard surface impact, the structure is designed to absorb the impact \nenergy through plastic collapse for metallic components, or through brittle fragmentation \nfor composites.  This sacrificial structure allows the loads experienced by the occupants \nto be reduced to survivable levels, which is achieved through the harmonious interaction \nbetween the landing gear, subfloor stroke, energy absorbing seat and the restraint system.  \nDuring a hard surface impact, the outer skin plays no part in the energy absorption, as \nshown in Fig. 1a.  \nThe water impact environment is a challenging design scenario for which a \nconventional metallic subfloor performs poorly in terms of transmitting the water \npressure and absorbing energy.  During a water impact, the main mechanisms for energy \nabsorption are different to hard ground, as the dominant response is through the \nmembrane and bending behavior of the skin, coupled with limited plastic collapse of the \nsurrounding structure due to its high failure strength, shown schematically in Fig. 1b.  \nThis response results in high forces and accelerations being passed into the airframe and \ntypically leads to the distortion of the passenger floor, the jamming or loss of the doors, \ntogether with the possibility of skin failure.  Failure of the skin in turn reduces the \nfloatation capabilities of the airframe and exposes the internal structure to secondary \ndamage caused by water ingress.  A summary of the typical structural damage \nencountered during a helicopter impact on water is presented in table 1.  \n3 \n4 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nDitchings \/ Crash Investigations \nDuring the 1980\u2019s, data for Civilian helicopter accidents was limited, as the data was \ntypically reviewed by separate agencies and the information was generally fragmented, \nmaking it difficult to identify potential design improvements, or amend existing \nregulations, as an envelope of survivability had yet to be defined.  \nThis problem was first addressed in 1986 by Coltman (Ref. 10) who provided a \nhistorical review of civil helicopter accidents that occurred between 1974 and 1978, \nwhich was later followed by a review of United States of America (U.S.) Navy and Army \naccidents in the same year (Ref. 11).  A multitude of crash scenarios were considered, \nalong with the mechanism and level of injuries sustained, which led to subsequent safety \nrecommendations.  The use of a shoulder harness could eliminate most of the injuries for \nimpacts with a high forward velocity component.  Harnesses were later incorporated to \nreplace conventional lap belts as they demonstrated significant benefits for both impacts \non hard and water surfaces.  Impacts on water with a forward velocity component \ntypically absorb energy through water displacement.  Restraining the occupants fully, \nminimises the possibility of flailing injuries and other trauma associated with lap belts.  \nIn addition, the authors of Reference 11 recommend the use of energy absorbing seats, a \nfloatation system to promote a stable post crash attitude, as well as emergency lighting in \nthe event of an impact in reduced or low light. \nThe subsequent design improvements recommended in Reference 11 were based \nupon accidents that occurred between 1974 and 1978.  As the role of the helicopter \ndiversified, a recommendation was made to regularly review the current implemented \nsystems in order to improve their functionality, or operation.  This feedback was essential \n4 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \nto the future development of helicopters, as it would see the flight envelope being \nextended outside roles initially considered. \nIn order to collate comprehensive information from an accident, the USA Army \ndeveloped a methodology in 1986, where specialists in the field would collect their \nrespective data, as discussed in Adams (Ref. 12).  A communication structure would then \nbe in place that would enable the information to be shared between different departments, \nallowing trade-offs to be performed on the level of crashworthiness that should be \nincorporated into new designs, by taking into account projected costs and estimates on \nthe benefit in the reduction of fatalities. \nIn order to refine the data set, comprehensive USA studies were performed in 1993 \nfor Naval helicopter water impacts by Wittlin (Ref. 13), Chen (Ref. 14) and Muller (Ref. \n15), who examined helicopter water ditchings that occurred between 1982 and 1989.  \nThis study was performed in two phases, where Part I dealt with the analysis of the \nimpact and post impact conditions (Ref. 14), and Part II provided an assessment of the \nstructural response on occupant injury, approaches for alleviating injuries, together with \nan evaluation of current numerical techniques for modeling helicopter impacts onto water \n(Ref. 15). \nThe findings from Part I identified three impact conditions, as well as two possible \npost water impact scenarios, which were immediate and delayed overturn of the airframe.  \nCareful consideration was given to personal and helicopter floatation capabilities, which \nwere generally found to be inadequate.  The two main hazards to occupant survivability \nreported by Chen (Ref. 14) were drowning and exposure, which identifies the need for \n5 \n6 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \ndeveloping the post impact behavior, as well as improving the energy absorbed by the \nairframe. \nStructural failure of the rotorcraft was not found to contribute significantly to the \nlevel of injury, as in most cases, the occupiable volumes satisfied the definition of \nsurvivable.  The flotation equipment was found to be poor, as it was incapable of \nretaining the floatation, stability, or orientation of the airframe.   Reference 15 discusses a \nvariety of techniques recommended for alleviating injury, including better occupant \nrestraint, delethalisation of interior, energy absorbing seats, together with improved \nperformance and use of flotation equipment. \nOne of the more recent European Union reviews for helicopter impacts on water was \nperformed as part of the CAST project, which is an acronym for the \u201cCrashworthiness of \nHelicopters on Water: Design of Structures using Advanced Simulation Tools\u201d.  The \noriginal internal project report (not publically available) was performed by Agusta in \n2001, who assessed civilian helicopter impacts between 1982 and 2000, which involved \nworld-wide accident databases.  This assessment led to the classification of four different \nimpact cases, namely controlled and uncontrolled ditchings, vertical descents, and fly-ins, \nwhere the pilot has full-control and is unaware of the iminent impact.  This initial Agusta \nreview was extended by Hughes in 2005 (Ref 16), who considered the yearly distribution \nof accidents, the level of injury for partial and survivable impacts, the post impact \nresponse and the degree of structural failure.  Reference 16 concludes that the level and \nnature of the injuries are extremely susceptible to a variety of factors, namely helicopter \nconstruction, internal configuration and impact kinematics.  Efforts need to focus not \nonly on improving the crashworthiness of the internal subfloor structure to accommodate \n6 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \nboth hard and water requirements, but also in the area of floatation, as providing a stable \nplatform and attitude for as long as possible will clearly reduce the number of post impact \nfatalities for survivable accidents. \nComponent Drop Tests \nOne of the difficulties in designing for crashworthiness is the limited amount of \nsacrificial structure available to occupants involved in helicopter crashes, when compared \nto their fixed wing transport counterparts, which results in a continual drive to develop \nhigh performance energy absorbing materials and develop concepts to improve occupant \nsurvivability.  To aid in the understanding of the failure mechanisms involved in a water \nimpact, experimental studies, along with the application of numerical methods were used \nto good effect.  This section will review the experimental and numerical studies \nperformed related to subfloor sections. \nOne of the early experimental studies was reported by Cronkhite (Ref. 17) in 1982, \nwhere the NASA Langley Research Center performed an experimental investigation into \nthe effectiveness of five subfloor concepts onto both ground and water surfaces by \nquantifying the energy absorbed.  The different crashworthy concepts included \ncorrugated beams and half shells, foam filled cylinders, notched corners and canted \nbulkheads and included a drop test on water.  The results generated from this study were \nused for code validation in 2004, which will be discussed later in this review.  In \naddition, Berry (Ref. 18) contributed to developing our understanding of how energy \nabsorbing structures are affected by the type of impact surface. \nThe characterisation of a metallic subfloor structure subject to hard surface and water \nimpacts was dealt comprehensively within the CAST project, where two similar sections \n7 \n8 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nof subfloor were dropped as part of one experimental campaign.  Comparison of test and \nsimulation for an 8ms-1 drop test of a subfloor section of a Westland WG-30 helicopter \n(aft passenger section) is reported in Ref. 19 by Pentec\u00f4te in 2002, in which simulation \nstudies were performed using Pam-Crash, and reported in Ref. 20 by Hughes in which \nsimulations were conducted using LS-DYNA3D in 2003.     \nThe two metallic subfloor components were manufactured from a 2014 aluminium \nalloy, consisting of longerons that run along the longitudinal axis of the helicopter, that \nare reinforced with evenly spaced L-section stiffeners.  The lower parts of the longerons \nare reinforced with Z-section stiffeners that run fully along their length, which are also \ndirectly riveted to these frames and lower skin.  The curved longitudinal end-sections are \nconnected directly to the main lift frames and provide a direct load path for the main \nengine and gearbox assemblies. \nThe frames orientated in the transverse direction are also manufactured from metallic \nsheet and are typically shorter in length.  L-section brackets are riveted to the top part of \nthese frames, which provides the transverse attachment points for the floor.  These \ntransverse frames are connected to the longerons via C-section overlaps to form \nindividual box-sections.  The transverse frames contain a cut out for a z-section stringer \nthat runs along the mid-section span of the skin, in order to provide structural rigidity.  \nThe upper panels that form the passenger section are manufactured from Fibrelam, \nconsisting of unidirectional glass fibres bonded to a honeycomb \/ aramid core.  The lower \nmetallic panels form the outer skin and are riveted directly to longitudinal and transverse \nframes.   \n8 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \n In references 19 and 20, a complete-section-by-section analysis was performed both \nquantitively and qualitatively with simulation results for the 8ms-1 drop test performed at \nthe water impact facility at CIRA, Italy.  As shown in Fig. 2, the metallic floor retains its \nglobal integrity, as the main longitudinal frames remain intact.  The belly skin deflects \nsignificantly in-between these frames, together with two locations of skin failure due to \nrivet pull out and material fracture.  The curved end sections of the floor remain relatively \nundamaged, as their shape minimizes loading at these locations due to the redirection of \nthe water surface.  The dominant behavior of the skin in response to a water impact can \nbe clearly seen in Fig. 2, where the skin deflects in between the main longitudinal frames.  \nReferences 19 and 20 provide a detailed understanding of the collapse mechanism for \nthis type of loading, which is critical if design limitations and possible improvements are \nto be identified, such as improving the membrane response of the skin and improving the \ntransmission of the water pressure into the subfloor beams and the increased collapse of \nframe and intersection joints.  The recommendation for a dual role capability coincides \nwith the conclusions reported by Vignjevic (Ref. 21) and Ubels (Ref. 22). \nImproving the crushing behavior of the intersection joints is an area of active research \nas many authors have identified this limitation in relation to water impacts, due to the \nlimited collapse that is observed.  The redesign of the intersection elements was given \nconsideration by Bisagni (Ref. 23) in 2002, where Pam-Crash was used to initially \nanalyze an isolated element and then a complete metallic subfloor section in response to \nhard surface drop tests and horizontal sled loadings.  Load-shortening diagrams were \nused to compute the peak load, average crush load, specific absorbed energy and the \nstroke and crush load efficiencies in order to assess the validity of the numerical \n9 \n10 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \napproach.  Consideration was given to rivet modeling, whereby beam elements with \nvarying cross-sectional properties were defined.  For a single intersection joint, the \nnumber of failed rivets was close to test, but visualization was difficult due to the large \nnumber of plastic folds that ensued.  The author of Reference 23 performed an \ninvestigation into how rivet failure affects the loads and the resulting behavior by using \nthe same numerical model with no failure defined.  The results changed by a few percent, \nindicating that rivet strength was not a critical parameter.  Due to the high level of \ncorrelation achieved, the author of Reference 23 could, with good confidence, consider \nthe application of optimization techniques to improve the energy absorption capabilities \nof the present design.   \nFurther consideration was given to characterising a subfloor response to hard surface \nand water impacts by Skinner (Ref. 24) in 2003, who investigated the effect of rivet \nfailure on the structural response using the coupled DYNA3D FE-SPH capability \ndeveloped at Cranfield.  Skinner (Ref. 24) agrees with Bisagni (Ref. 23), as the global \nresponse appears to be relatively insensitive to rivet failure, although differences in the \nlocal collapse mechanism were reported. \nIn 2005, Hughes (Ref. 16) provides a comprehensive study of the crashworthiness of \nhelicopters onto water and presents a comparison between test and simulation for the \nimpact of a typical metallic subfloor section onto both hard surface and water (Fig. 3), \ntogether with a fully instrumented WG-30 helicopter drop test onto water (shown later in \nFig. 4).  The detailed quantitative and qualitative assessments for frame heights and the \nmagnitudes for the deflection of the skin enabled an assessment of the validity of \ncomponent and full-scale simulations with respect to one another, as well as identifying \n10 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \ndesign changes that could potentially improve the level of crashworthiness currently \noffered.   \nComposite Materials Research : Implications For Crashworthiness On Water \nAs understanding of the failure mechanisms associated with impacts on water \nincreased, it became clear that existing crashworthy components were inadequate, which \nforced engineers to consider redesigning the construction of the frames to promote \ncollapse, as well as improving the membrane response of the skin.  This change in \nthinking allowed engineers to assess different frame constructions from an energy \nabsorbing point of view, as well as giving consideration to the type of materials used.  \nEngineers turned towards the use of composite materials as a possible solution to the \nwater impact problem. \nThe potential offered by the use of composites for a crash application can be traced \nback to 1980, where Pifko (Ref. 25) presented a combined automotive and aeronautical \nanalysis using DYCAST (Dynamic Crash Analysis of Structures, Ref. 26), which \ncompared the differences between a composite and a more traditional aluminum structure \nonto a hard surface.  The composite construction demonstrated the benefits not only in \nreducing the forces transmitted to the occupants, but also the weight advantages that can \nbe attained without compromising structural strength.   \nDue to the dominant membrane behavior of the skin, the skin is highly loaded, which \ncan fail either diretly in the mateiral itself, or through a combination of material and rivet \nfailure.  This failure typically results in secondary damage caused by the ingress of water \nand the corresponding reduction in the floatation capabilities of the airframe.  Increasing \nthe membrane stiffness of the skin without failing was critical if the loads were to be \n11 \n12 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \ntransferred to other energy absorbing components of the design.  Naturally, engineers \nturned to composite materials for this type of mechanical response, which led to the \npublication of the tensor skin concept in 1994 (Ref. 27).  This concept was further \ndeveloped by performing both static and dynamic tests of a single sine wave construction \nof a representative subfloor section in 1995 (Ref. 28). The results were encouraging from \nboth studies, as the tensor skin demonstrated an ability to transfer the membrane loads \nand initiate crushing to other parts of the subfloor.  This concept was extended by \nDelatombe (Ref. 29) in 1998, which involved validation against different box and \ncruciform structures.   \nThe development of composite material models to predict inter and intra ply \ndelamination and failure has led to significant development by academic and research \ninstitutions worldwide.  A comprehensive review of composites was provided by \nKindervater (Ref. 30) in 1997, in terms of their manufacturability, different types of \ntrigger mechanisms that can be employed to initiate a crushing response, along with the \nvalidation of finite element techniques to predict their energy absorbing response.  The \nliterature contains numerous papers directly related to composite material model \ndevelopment and its application as an energy absorber, but this is beyond the scope of \nthis paper, which focuses on the methods \/ techniques directly related to helicopter water \nrelated research.  For further reading on composite model development, the reader is \ndirected to reference 31. \nSareen (Ref. 32) in 1999 provides a summary of the crash analysis of energy \nabsorbing subfloors during ground and water impacts.  To further develop the application \nof sine wave beams for longitudinal and lateral frames and to move away from traditional \n12 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \nmetallic panels, Vicente (Ref. 33) in 2000 assessed their applicability for impact onto \nhard and soft gravel surfaces using a carbon fiber composite.  The composite model \ndeveloped was based on a macroscopic approach to develop equivalent material \nproperties, which required extensive tuning and a priori knowledge of the failure modes.  \nDespite this limitation, the characterization of this type of frame construction and its \npotential for providing a progressive collapse front, overcomes the poor frame response \nobserved with conventional metallic frames. \nThe application of the tensor skin was further demonstrated by McCarthy (Ref. 34) in \n2000, where sine wave beams were used to promote controlled crushing, as well as \ntapered cruciform elements to provide lateral strength and an increasing collapse load.  \nThe floor specimen was dropped onto rigid ground and soft soil in order to characterize \nits response to two different impact surfaces, together with material calibration via quasi-\nstatic bulge tests.  Further development work was required, as debonding \/ delamination \neffects were not captured with the current modeling approach, which would be \nproblematic if water tests were performed.  However, the results further demonstrated the \npotential benefits of this concept over conventional metallic skins. \nAnother area for improvement concerns the joints formed at the intersection between \nlongitudinal and lateral frames.  With a conventional metallic floor, the frames are \ndirectly connected via rivets.  This type of construction reinforces these locations and \nhinders the progressive collapse of the frames, as higher collapse loads are now required.   \nIn order to develop a composite solution to this problem, a three year German \/ French \nresearch collaboration between ONERA and DLR was reported in 2000 by Delatombe \n(Ref. 35), who provides a summary of the research performed on carbon \/ aramid \/ epoxy \n13 \n14 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nlaminates.  In reference 35, Pam-Crash was used by DLR to recreate cylindrical crush \nspecimens and the quasi-static and dynamic simulation of sub-floor box structures, \nconsisting of longitudinal beams (sinewave, trapezoid and rib-stiffened), lateral \nbulkheads and cruciform intersection elements.  Good agreement was obtained, although \nload levels and energy absorption were low due to over simplifications in the fabric \nmodel developed.  The application of new cruciform intersection joints is particularly \nrelevant to the development of water crashworthiness, as existing metallic designs do not \nuse the available stroke efficiently. \nThis paper recognizes the significant contribution to the field of composite \ncrashworthiness by Kindervater (Ref. 36), through detailed experimental campaigns, \nimplementation of new composite material models to replicate fiber \/ matrix failure and \ninterply delamination.  The author of Reference 36 recognizes the importance of \ndeveloping these types of models, which were extensively tested through bird strike on \nwing leading edges, sacrificial Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) fuselage \ncomponents, as well the composite demonstrator developed as part of the CAST project \n(which will be discussed later in this paper). \nApplications Of Numerical Methods \/ Methods Development \nThe solving of non-linear transient problems has led to the development of a broad \nrange of numerical methods, such as Lagrangian, Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian, coupled \nFE-SPH (Finite Elements and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics), together with hybrid \napproaches.  The difference between these methods lies in the spatial discretisation used \nand the corresponding computational resources required, which allows a diverse range of \n14 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \napplications to be numerically simulated.  This section will describe the application and \nevolution of these computational methods for developing helicopter crashworthiness. \nOne of the earliest papers related to the crashworthiness of helicopters can be found \nin 1977 by Winter (Ref. 37), which is one of the first studies that employs numerical \nfinite element analysis to predict the deformation of a skin covered aluminum frame \nimpacting into a rigid barrier.   \nThe use of the finite element technique as a potential design tool is evident from the \nnumber of papers produced during the 1990\u2019s, which demonstrate the versatility of this \napproach.  For example, Vignjevic (Ref. 38) published a paper in 1997, which concerns \nthe detailed analysis of a Lynx airframe impacting onto a rigid surface.  The methodology \nadopted involved an iterative design process, whereby the code was used to optimize the \nthickness of the lift frame.  This approach provided an insight into how a code can be \nvalidated against test and then used in a predictive manner in situations where \nexperimental testing would be too costly.  \nDue to the limited computational capabilities at the time, many researchers were \ninvolved with the development of hybrid methods, such as DRI\/KRASH (Ref. 39), which \nuses lumped masses and user-defined beams to represent a complex structure.  This \napproach allows parametric investigations to be performed for a significantly reduced \nsimulation time when compared to a finite element model.  However, the costs associated \nwith this method are the significant input and man-hour costs required in order to develop \na tuned model. \nWittlin (Ref. 13) performed a survey of Naval helicopter water impacts in a study \npublished in 1993, that employed a hybrid DRI\/KRASH analysis.  The authors of \n15 \n16 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nReference 11 were able to employ the analytical simulation of the entire crash scenario \nduring impact and post impact.  The advantage of this type of analysis is the rapid \nevaluation of different impact conditions, for example, to determine the benefits from an \nextracted or retracted landing gear for various sea states.  \nThe development of numerical methods to predict the response of composite energy \nabsorbers for low speed impacts in transport aircraft was the focus of a 4th European \nUnion framework project to design for crash-survivability, CRASURV (Ref. 40).  The \nproject was launched in 1996 and was partially funded under the Aeronautics Area of the \nprogramme on Industrial and Materials Technology (BRITE \/ EURAM).  Coupon tests \nand dynamic subfloor drop tests were performed in order to support the simulation \nactivity, which led to the conclusion that deficiencies exist in modeling progressive \nfailure of fabric composites.  The literature generated from this research project will be \ndiscussed later in this paper. \nWittlin (Ref. 41) reports on the findings of using a combined numerical approach for \nthe water impact of a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Osprey in 1997.  The \ndetailed finite element approach allowed the structural deformation to be modeled \nexplicitly and could be used for final design verification, whereas a \u201csimpler\u201d \nDRI\/KRASH model was also developed, which provided a global response of the \nstructure and is better suited to concept development through parametric investigations.  \nThe idea of using these two codes in conjunction is now common practice (Ref. 42), as \ndata can be mutually interchanged between codes for self-validation, in an effort to \nreduce the reliance on experimental testing.    \n16 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \nThe need for developing a water methodology was discussed by Clarke (Ref. 43), as \npart of a joint Rotorcraft Industry Technology Association (RITA) research project in \n1998.  Here, the merits of an ALE approach are discussed to see whether this formulation \nwas capable of recreating the pressures by incorporating a layer of air between water and \nstructure.  Many modeling issues were identified, such as correctly initializing the \nvelocities for the structure and surrounding air particles by incorporating the free fall of \nthe structure.  There are also problems associated with the blending logic used to handle \nthe transmission of the variables, which can also affect the accuracy of the solution.  The \nALE approach is computationally expensive when compared to other numerical methods \nand it has yet to be demonstrated whether incorporating this layer of air can significantly \nimprove the accuracy of crash performance simulations. \nThe application of alternative approaches to water modeling was further demonstrated \nin 1999 by Ribet (Ref. 44), who explored Lagrangian and ALE options available within \nthe commercial code RADIOSS.  Both formulations have limitations to fluid modeling, \nas stability issues when simulating an extreme deformation event limit Lagrangian \napproaches, whereas the Eulerian part of ALE is better suited to predicting fluid flow, \nthese methods suffer from blending logic and the associated difficulty of material \ntracking through the cells.  These limitations made the author or Reference 43 conclude \nthat developing a Lagrangian model (to capture structural response) with a fluid \ncapability could provide optimum results.  This view is shared by many researchers, \nwhich has led to the extensive development of a coupled FE-SPH capability to \nincorporate this recommendation.  \n17 \n18 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nThe ALE approach has demonstrated its potential by providing good agreement with \nVon Karman Theory for the magnitude of the pressures and accelerations for a \nconventional metallic subfloor structure impacting onto water, as reported by Vignjevic \n(Ref. 45) in 2001.  Vignjevic identifies the importance of the water as a passive energy \nabsorber, as the conventional design was predicted to absorb 55% less energy when \ncompared to a hard surface impact.  In a subsequent paper published in 2002, Vignjevic \n(Ref. 21) demonstrates how an ALE approach was used as a predictive design tool, by \nvalidating a novel design concept that attempts to overcome the problem of high strength \nlocations and the resulting high decelerations passed through the cabin floor to the \noccupant.  A dual role capability floor was proposed, whereby the localized collapse \nstrength of the joints could change, depending upon the type of surface encountered.  The \nconcept was validated numerically, but further research is required to develop this \nconcept into a feasible solution.   \nIn the same year, Vignjevic (Ref. 46) also presented a paper on the development of a \nrepulsive contact treatment implemented within their SPH code, which was a necessary \nrequirement in order to develop a coupled FE-SPH capability, which had the potential to \nextend the capabilities of existing numerical techniques.   \nThe contribution by Fasanella (Ref. 47) to the field of water impact was published in \n2003, through testing of a composite aircraft fuselage section, described by Jackson (Ref. \n48), that was dropped at 25ft s-1 onto water for the purpose of direct comparison with \nprior drop tests onto hard surface and soft soil.  The subfloor of the fuselage section \nconsisted of five uniformly spaced Rohacell foam blocks overlaid with E-glass\/epoxy \nface sheets; its construction similar to a conventional metallic box-section and skin \n18 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \nstructure.  The experimental drop test was supported by numerical simulation using the \n\u201cfast\u201d fluid-structure coupling within MSc DYTRAN and ALE and SPH formulations \navailable within LS-DYNA3D.  The authors of Reference 47 provide extremely practical \nmodeling recommendations for all three approaches, along with their limitations.  The \ndamage observed was consistent with current understanding with multiple failures of the \nfiberglass face sheets, due to high in-plane membrane strains generated as the skin \ndeflects in between the Rohacell frames, which show no evidence of collapse.  The \nauthors (Ref. 47) conclude that a coupled Lagrangian FE and SPH approach showed the \nbest agreement with test, although further modifications were needed in refining the \nmaterial properties for the fiberglass skin, as the predicted damage was more severe than \ntest. \nAnother American study was published in 2003 by Randhawa (Ref. 49), whose aim \nwas to investigate the application of numerical techniques to impacts on water, through \nlow speed spherical projectiles and the recreation of the UH-1H drop test performed by \nWittlin in 2000 (Ref. 50).  Reasonable agreement for the spherical drop tests were \nperformed with Lagrangian and ALE formulations.  ALE was used to predict the \naccelerations levels, which were applied as an impulse to two different seat models in \nMADYMO (Ref 51).  The analysis demonstrated how the lumbar loads could be reduced \nthrough careful seat design.  The development of a coupled local and global approach is \ngaining increasing popularity as a virtual testing approach, especially as numerical codes \nbecome more capable and robust. \nThe previously discussed experimental campaign performed under the European \nUnion CAST project was novel, in that it was the first time that the same passenger floor \n19 \n20 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nconstruction would be subject to two extreme types of loading in one experimental \nprogram.  Another objective of CAST involved the development of predictive numerical \nmethods that could assist helicopter manufacturers in a Virtual testing environment. \nThe component floors dropped onto both hard and water surfaces were studied \nnumerically and published by Pentec\u00f4te and Kohlgr\u00fcber using Pam-Crash (Ref. 52 and \n53) in 2003 and 2004 respectively.  In parallel, Hughes in 2003 (Ref. 20) performed the \nsame simulations using LS-DYNA3D (Fig. 3), which allowed independent assessments \nto be made of two commercial codes, with a view for numerical methods development.  \nA coupled FE-SPH approach to fluid-structure interaction was also presented by De \nVuyst (Ref. 54) also as part of the CAST project, together with a paper discussing the \napplication of the finite element approach to water impact by Kohlgr\u00fcber (Ref. 55), and \nZorz (Ref. 42), who provided a comparison between full-scale WG-30 drop test and \nsimulation using DRI\/KRASH. \nIn 2005, this work was extended by Hughes (Ref. 16) who discusses the problems \nassociated with a Lagrangian approach to water modeling through the application of rigid \nshapes impacting onto water.  Alternative techniques to water modeling are also \npresented in an attempt to minimize the stability problems that arise between fluid and \nstructure boundaries.  A methodology is presented in Reference 20 concerning the \nsimulation of fluid-structure interaction problems within the SAFESA approach (SAFE \nStructural Analysis - Vignjevic (Ref. 56)), in identifying idealization, procedural and \nformulation errors, along with techniques and recommended practices to minimize their \neffects.  Reference 16 concludes with applying the validated simulation tools to \ninvestigate a potential solution for improving the crashworthy response by developing a \n20 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \nmultiple cell configuration that attempts to maximize skin deflection and the passive \nenergy absorbed through the water.   \nHughes (Ref. 16) also discusses modeling guidelines on applying a purely Lagrangian \napproach to modeling water, as well as providing discussion on the areas of good and \npoor agreement.  A purely Lagrangian approach was chosen, as it represents the \u201clowest\u201d \ncomputational cost over other methods including ALE and SPH and would be better \nsuited to capturing the structural response, as initially, inertial forces dominate over \nviscous forces.  The use of this approach would allow code limitations to be identified \n(which was the aim of this research), which could be refined at a later stage, if more \ncomplicated numerical methods were required.   \nDifficulties encountered with a purely Lagrangian approach concern the pressure time \nhistories, due to a difference in dynamic impedance between simulation and test, as the \nsimulation only modeled water-structure, as opposed to water-air-structure that occurs in \nreality.  Therefore, the cushioning effect this layer of air has on the pressures could not be \ninvestigated.  The situation is further compounded by contact instabilities that develop in \nthe water elements, together with limitations in the material model (no cavitation, etc) \nused to represent water.  These problems occurred when applying a purely Lagrangian \napproach to water modeling and its implication on virtual testing were reported by \nHughes (Ref. 57) in 2006. \nThe difficulties of existing numerical water models to predict the water pressure can \nresult in spurious results, including negative pressures.  Due to the penalty nature of the \ncontact algorithms used, this approach can lead to separation between water and \nstructural finite elements, together with dynamic impedance issues between test and \n21 \n22 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nsimulation.  This issue raises questions concerning the accuracy of the structural response \npredicted, due to errors in the pressure loads generated.  Zardoni (Ref. 58) in 2005 \nattempts to develop a simple cavitation model within DYNA3D to incorporate some of \nthe main features of cavitation, namely the introduction of a minimum pressure threshold \nthat prevents the pressures from becoming negative and the introduction of air\/liquid \nproperties in the regions of cavitation formation.  Experimental data was generated by \ndropping an aluminum box at various impact velocities, which was instrumented with \nstrain gauges. \nExisting methods use a simple cut-off pressure, which prevents the pressure from \ngoing lower than a user-defined threshold, which can yield acceptable results for certain \napplications.  However, when cavitation is present, this model is not accurate enough.  \nThe proposed cavitation model was based upon a step-by-step vapour pressure \ncalculation using Antoine\u2019s equation and is widely used in engineering applications.  The \nequations for density and speed of sound in the air\/water mixture employ a void fraction \ncalculation that is dependent upon the bubble growth velocity, which make it possible to \ntake into account fluid property changes.  While some improvement was noted, this topic \nremains a current area of research.  \nThe trends in numerical simulation related to aircraft structures under crash and high \nvelocity impact are discussed by Kindervater (Ref. 36) in 2005, who provides a summary \nof how explicit codes have been used to support concept, design and certification.  The \npaper provides an overview of helicopter crashworthiness to impacts on water, with \nstrong reference to the outcomes of the CAST project.  Significant research has been \nprovided by Kindervater on the development of composite energy absorbing structural \n22 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \ncrashworthiness concepts.  Kindervater also discusses the crashworthiness of an A320 \nfuselage section impacting onto a rigid surface, as well as the ditching of transport \naircraft on water.  Fly-in impacts require significant computational resources and a \ncoupled FE-SPH code to perform this type of analysis.  The influences of cavitation, \nsuction forces and the cushion effect the layer of air has between structure and the water \nsurface is highlighted by Kindervater, who recommends the use of SPH particles to \nrepresent air.   \nFull-Scale Testing \nA full-scale airframe drop test onto water was reported by Candy (Ref. 59) in 2000, \nwhere the application of a purely Lagrangian approach was applied to recreate the \nhelicopter accident at the Brent Spar oil platform in 1990 (Ref. 60).  In addition, separate \nsimulations were performed using Lagrangian and coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian \napproaches to recreate a fly-in impact of the space shuttle (Ref. 60).  The comparisons \nrevealed a useful insight into both approaches, which led to the conclusion that a purely \nLagrangian approach demonstrated its potential as a cost effective design tool in \nrecreating a vertical water impact, whereas the coupled formulation suffered from \nnumerical noise and divergence in the response due to a limited water model that did not \ninclude buoyancy effects. \nPrior to the 1990\u2019s, the US dominated the research in the field of crashworthiness \nonto water.  The first European coordinated research came in 1993 entitled \n\u201cCrashworthiness for Commercial Aircraft\u201d, which was a 3rd European Union framework \nprogram, whose aim was to increase safety in moderate commercial aircraft crashes (Ref. \n61).  This program led to increased European Union knowledge in this field and allowed \n23 \n24 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nEuropeans to play a stronger role in informing the Civilian regulatory bodies of their \nfindings and recommendations, with a view for advising in the development of \ncrashworthiness guidelines.  The project achieved many milestones, including the \ndevelopment of new non-linear capabilities in the form of improved material models for \nenergy absorption. \nHELISAFE (Ref. 62) was introduced in 2000 and was a 5th Framework European \nUnion research programme, whose aim was to improve the survivability of occupants in \nhelicopter crashes through the use of an advanced safety system concept, which was \nbased upon interacting safety features.  HELISAFE developed a simulation tool (HOSS) \nthat was capable of predicting the response loads on the human body by taking into \naccount the interaction of passive safety features.  Sled tests were performed using crash \ntest dummies that enabled parametric studies to be performed, which led to the \ndevelopment of new proposals for certification procedures and the increased use of crash \ntest dummies in subsequent experimental programmes.   \nRecent European projects in aeronautical crashworthiness are typically through \ncollaborative projects, whereby increased emphasis is placed upon the pooling of \nspecialist organizations and experimental expertise.  These combined efforts are more \nfavorable in attracting funding due to the cross fertilization of ideas, which in turn, leads \nto an increase in the number of full-scale experimental test programmes in order to \nenhance current understanding. \nOne of the first documented full-scale tests was performed in 1999 by Fasanella (Ref. \n63), whereby a composite helicopter was dropped onto a rigid surface.  The experimental \ndata was used to validate the composite modeling capabilities of MSC DYTRAN.  A \n24 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \ntwo-stage process was used, whereby the output from a detailed landing gear model was \nused to provide the initial conditions for a detailed fuselage model.  This approach \nprovided a high level of agreement for the accelerations, the sub-floor crushing response \nand time sequence of deformation, providing confidence in the use of a finite element \napproach as a crashworthy design tool. \nThe caveats associated with performing full-scale drop tests were highlighted in the \nsame year, where the difficulties associated with assessing the validity of numerical \nresults by direct comparison to test for a UH-1H impact onto water, were discussed for \nboth FE and hybrid approaches by Wittlin (Ref. 41 and 50).  Problems arise due to the \nlarge amount of scatter with the experimental results, especially for the pressures, as \nneither code was able to produce satisfactory results.  This issue led the authors of \nReference 41 to conclude that absolute agreement to test should not be used as a \nvalidation criterion and also raised the issue that a window of correlation is required.  \nThe latest European Union funded research into helicopter crashworthiness was \nimplemented in 2000 with the CAST project (Ref. 64).  This program served to enhance \ncurrent understanding of water impacts through a series of dedicated experimental \ncomponent and full-scale tests.  This project involved assessing current commercial finite \nelement codes for their applicability to water modeling, together with the \nrecommendations for future numerical tools development.  This modeling effort led to \nthe development of a coupled Lagrangian FE-SPH capability, as discussed by De Vuyst \n(Ref. 65) in 2003.  One of the outcomes of the project was the development of composite \nand metallic technology demonstrators that offered improved energy absorbing \ncapabilities for an impact on water.    \n25 \n26 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nAnother European Union Framework V research project was introduced in 2001 (Ref. \n66), whose aim was to develop methods and tools to predict the \u201cCRAsh behavior of \naircraft structures subject to High Velocity Impacts\u201d (CRAHVI).  Implementation of such \nmethods will contribute to enhancing safety through damage tolerant craft and the \ndevelopment of crashworthy aircraft concepts.  The impact conditions considered were \nbird-strike on wing leading edges, debris hits (tire and engine parts), hailstones on \ncomposite structures and fuselage impacts with water, sloped terrain and ground-based \nobstacles.  The state of the art analysis techniques were validated against a series of \nimpact tests, which led to numerical tools development and refinement. \nOther notable simulation efforts include a summary of rigid surface and water \nimpacts of a low fidelity WG-30 helicopter model (Ref. 67) in 2001.  Their aim was to \nassess current simulation tools, which found that a purely Eulerian approach was \nincapable of capturing the fluid-structure interaction.  What is interesting about this paper \nis the use of a coarse WG-30 6,000 element model to assess the damage to the floatation \nsystem and surrounding structure (which was developed significantly by Hughes (Ref. \n16), to incorporate over 360K elements as part of the CAST project (Fig 4.).  However, \nthe level of detail in the undercarriage made it difficult to perform a detailed analysis, as \nit allowed only the identification of potential problem areas, but the author of Reference \n67 recommends increasing the crumple zones in the structure in order to retain the \nbuoyancy of the helicopter.   \nSignificant contribution to the field of helicopter crashworthiness research has been \nprovided by Fasanella and Jackson (Ref. 68 through 75), who have not only provided \nevidence to assess the injury potential for occupants during full-scale hard surface drop \n26 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \ntests of composite rotorcraft and fuselage sections, but have also provided extensive \nguidelines on best practices for crash modeling and simulation (Ref. 76). \nIn 2002, Vigliotti (Ref. 77) presents the experimental campaign of an 8ms-1 water \ndrop test of a complete WG-30 airframe as part of the CAST project.  The airframe \nfuselage overturns a few seconds after impact, which was fully instrumented with \naccelerometers, pressure transducers and an anthropomorphic test dummy.  In 2003, \nPentec\u00f4te (Ref. 52) discusses the application of Pam-Crash to this drop test and provides \na quantitative comparison between test and simulation for the pressures, accelerations and \nmain features of deformation obtained using a Lagrangian water representation.  The \ncalculated and observed deformations of the structure correlated well, although the \nsimulation results were conservative when compared to test.  Pentec\u00f4te also reported the \ndifficulty in comparing pressure time histories, as little agreement was obtained for the \ninitial peak load, which was overestimated by the code. \nLatest Developments \nPrevious attempts at improving the crashworthiness of rotorcraft have revolved \naround developing a new design, which is a costly approach, but does allow more \nflexibility to overcome any inherent limitations with existing designs.  The applications \nof retrofit solutions are starting to be developed.  The development of a cost effective \nsolution that can be applied across the entire helicopter fleet is preferable.  One example \nof a retrofit solution is the composite fuselage section, reported by Jackson (Ref. 48), \nwhere a composite foam subfloor was designed to limit the loads transmitted to the \noccupants and to provide a stable floor for reacting crush loads during hard surface \n27 \n28 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nimpacts.  The same fuselage section was evaluated for soft soil and water impact, as \nreported in Ref. 47. \nIn order to address current limitations with conventional metallic subfloor structures, \nKohlgr\u00fcber (Ref. 53), presented in 2004, a summary of the latest composite subfloor \ndesign that represents the culmination of research and development during the European \nCAST project.  The proposed design consists of a novel approach to avoiding skin \nrupture during an impact on water, as well as crashworthy components specifically \nincorporated to provide an improved response during a hard surface impact.   \nA novel composite skin was developed that consists of a flexible outer skin \nconstructed from aramid fibers, which is stiffened by a Rohacell foam layer (Fig. 5).  A \nfurther layer of aramid is glued to form the inside surface of the skin.   \nThis concept absorbs the impact energy through the delamination of the Rohacell \nfoam layer from the outer composite skin, which in turn leads to a reduced bending \nstiffness and allows higher membrane forces to develop in the skin.  The reduction in \nbending stiffness and the fact that the skin retains its integrity allows the water loads to be \ntransferred to carbon bulkheads and the longitudinal beams that contribute to energy \nabsorption through controlled crushing.  In addition, carbon \/ aramid crush cones are \nincorporated at the joints of the frames to provide increased energy absorption during a \nhard surface impact.   \nThe authors of Reference 53 provide an overview of the extensive testing and \nnumerical simulation performed using Pam-Crash, which provided good correlation with \nrespect to the observed damage.  The same authors extended this simulation work by \nvarying the impact conditions to include pitch and roll, where they were able to \n28 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \ndemonstrate that the proposed new configuration worked well for all impact conditions \nconsidered, as shown in Fig. 6.  The skin concept allows large deformations without \nfailing, providing further confidence with the proposed solution to improving \ncrashworthiness on water. \nThis composite subfloor concept was also analyzed by Perez-garijo (Ref. 78), who \nperformed a survey of existing composite damage models within DYNA3D and \nimplemented a modified fabric damage model that allowed for the post failure \ndegradation of the elastic properties resulting from damage.  Test-analysis correlation \nalso revealed the same failure modes as noted by Kohlgr\u00fcber (Ref. 53), with good \nagreement for the locations of failure and the global response of the structure.  However, \nthe acceleration levels were consistently lower than was observed experimentally.   \nThe development of metallic subfloor concepts for improved crashworthy response \nonto hard and water surfaces was studied by Tho (Ref. 79) in 2004, which involved the \nassessment of cylindrical foam filled and corrugated half-shell concepts using ALE and \nSPH formulations within LS-DYN3D.  The numerical results were validated against drop \ntests performed during the 1980\u2019s by Cronkhite (Ref. 17), where five different energy \nabsorbing subfloor concepts were investigated under a NASA contract.  Sensitivity \nstudies were performed, which included varying the model parameters and impact angles, \nuntil an acceptable level of correlation was achieved.   \nFor the water analysis, only one drop test was performed, where the foam was \nremoved from the cylindrical concept, as reported by Berry (Ref. 18), who correlated the \nnumerical analyses for this impact condition, and then used the code to predict the \neffectiveness of the two different metallic concepts.  For all simulations, the magnitude of \n29 \n30 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nthe peak acceleration, pulse shape and duration were compared, as well as providing a \ncomponent breakdown for the energy absorbed.   \nThe authors of Reference 18 conclude that the presence of foam can stabilize energy \nattenuation for a hard surface impact, but little benefit was gained in terms of energy \nabsorption for a water impact.  For both concepts, the structures absorb much less energy \nwhen compared to the hard surface counterpart.  However, the authors (Ref. 18) \nrecommend that the analysis methodology developed could be used to evaluate and \nquantify multi-terrain impacts in order to improve and evaluate their crashworthy \nresponses. \nThe application of optimization techniques to the field of crashworthiness is \nbecoming increasingly common, especially for composite and honeycomb structures.  In \n2004, Lanzi (Ref. 80) discussed the application of neural networks to reproduce the crash \nresponse of structural components ranging from cylindrical riveted tubes, honeycomb \nstructures and a helicopter subfloor structure.  Despite the fact that only hard surface \nimpacts were considered, the ideas generated demonstrate the potential of using parallel \nsubsystems of small neural networks, with a view for developing robust and flexible \noptimization tools.  The key to success lies with the training of the neural networks, \nwhere Lanzi uses Pam-Crash to provide the necessary data points.  The results from the \noptimization process for the maximum and mean forces and the force-time curves agree \nwithin 10% of test, demonstrating the usefulness of this fast reanalysis methodology.  \nThis method has merit during the preliminary design phases in identifying promising \nconfigurations, which will have far reaching implications for all areas of crash protection. \n30 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \nRecent advances in the development of helicopter crashworthiness for impacts on \nwater are discussed by Vignjevic in 2006 at the European Rotorcraft Forum (Ref. 81).  \nThe authors of Reference 81 provide an overview of the research and development during \nthe last six years at Cranfield University, which has seen the development of new \nmetallic and composite damage models within DYNA3D, together with an algorithm for \ncoupling FE and SPH, as discussed by De Vuyst (Ref. 82) in 2005.  Reference 79 also \ndiscussed the recent development of an adaptive SPH capability, which significantly \nextends the boundaries in application to processes that involve extreme deformation, \nwhich will have a significant impact on safety, impact and crash evaluation studies \nperformed on water within a coupled Lagrangian framework.  The authors of Reference \n81 conclude that the development of a coupled FE-SPH capability has opened up the \npossibility of performing detailed post-impact survivability studies, as investigating the \nstability issues for a variety of sea-state conditions, may lead to design changes that can \nprolong a stable attitude and increase survivability due to exposure \/ drowning hazards.  \nIn 2006, Vignjevic extended this work by publishing a paper on an improved contact \nalgorithm for meshless methods (Ref. 83).  \nOne of the latest papers was published by Taher (Ref. 84) in 2006, who proposes a \nnew composite energy absorbing system for retrofit to aircraft and helicopters, which \nutilizes a lightweight composite energy absorbing keel-beam consisting of an inverting \nstringer.  With this design, the stringer guides the collapse failure mechanism of the \nframe by forcing it into a circular groove, so that the crush path is redirected back along \nthe frame.  In addition, polyurethane foam is used to prevent global frame buckling and \nto contribute to energy absorption.  The concept is tested experimentally as an \n31 \n32 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nimprovement for hard surface impact; however, impact testing is encouraged to \ndetermine the equivalent performance onto water. \nRecommendations For Future Directions \n1. Accident surveys \/ crash investigations are an essential part of crashworthiness \nresearch, in order to provide feedback on structural response (and hence understanding of \nthe failure mechanisms), and the effectiveness of proposed crashworthy measures. \n2. The experimental and numerical results have demonstrated that water impact is \na critical design scenario, where crash requirements from both hard and soft surfaces \nmust be taken into account during the preliminary design phase.  This issue has \nnecessitated the redesign of frame, joint and outer skin constructions and led to concept \nvalidation of dual role capability subfloor structures that utilize the \u2018infinite\u2019 stroke \noffered by the water as a passive energy absorber. \n3. The growth in the number of European funded research programmes has \nresulted in significant collaboration and technical exchange, enabling full-scale \nexperimental programmes to be conducted to further understand water impact \nphenomena, together with the validation of predictive numerical techniques.   \n4. Collaboration between research institutions and industry is extremely \nimportant and has led to the sharing of expertise.  One area that has seen significant \ndevelopment in the field of numerical methods is the application of coupled FE-SPH \napproaches to predict problems involving fluid-structure interaction.  \n5. Another growth area is the continued development of composite material \nmodels in order to provide a robust approach to modeling the complex failure modes \nexhibited by composites (crack formation, propagation and delamination).  This area will \n32 \nJAHS-1385-Feb-2007 \ncontinue to be important, due to increased use of composite materials in aircraft design.  \nIn addition, significant attention is also being given to the development of optimization \nmethods (discrete and robust) for crashworthiness research. \n6. Developing a next generation subfloor structure capable of providing improved \ncrash protection in the event of an impact onto both hard and water surfaces is possible \nthrough frame \/ joint design, triggers and the use of composite and metallic materials.  \nConcluding Remarks \nThe future for crashworthiness development of helicopters impacting water has made \nconsiderable leaps in terms or proposed concepts, improved material models for failure \nand validated simulation methodologies, which will not only result in improved rotorcraft \ndesigns, but will have significant benefit to other areas of passenger crash protection. \nThe development of a local \/ global coupled numerical approach is important.  \nDeveloping expertise in applying these methods to even more complex design regimes is \nnecessary, if authorities are to accept virtual testing techniques for design concept \ndevelopment and certification. \nIt is envisaged that the use of discrete and robust optimization methods will be a \nfundamental part of future engineering research, not only in the area of structural design, \nbut also in the field of crashworthiness.  In addition, hybrid optimizers are also being \ndeveloped that have the ability to switch from one search method (genetic algorithms, \netc) to other gradient based search methods in order to rapidly search the design space for \nan optimum configuration.  The future of crashworthiness research will lie in the \nexploration and development of these techniques, which will compliment existing \nnumerical methods research.  \n33 \n34 KEVIN HUGHES, JAMES CAMPBELL \nReferences \n1Seddon, C.M., and Moatamedi, M. \u201cReview of Water Entry with Applications to \nAerospace Structures\u201d, International Journal of Impact Engineering, Vol 32, (7),  \n2006, pp. 1045-1067. \n2Von Karman, Th.  \u201cThe Impact of Seaplane Floats during Landing\u201d, NACA TN 321, \n1929. \n3\u201dMilitary Standard, MIL-STD01210A, Light Fixed and Rotary Wing Aircraft \nResistance\u201d, Department of Defense, Washington DC, September, 1988 \n4\u201dAircraft Crash Survival Design Guide -
