Introduction\n[2] One of the fundamental advances in modern geo-\nchemistry of the solid Earth is the recognition of composi-\ntional heterogeneities in the Earth\u2019s mantle through studies\nof oceanic basalts. Ocean island basalts (OIB) are partic-\nularly variable in composition such that several isotopically\ndistinct mantle source end-members (e.g., \u2018\u2018DM\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018EM1\u2019\u2019,\n\u2018\u2018EM2\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018HUMU\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018FOZO\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018C\u2019\u2019) are required to explain\nthe variability [e.g., White, 1985; Zindler and Hart, 1986;\nHart et al., 1992; Hanan and Graham, 1996]. The isotopic\nratio differences among these end-members reflect the\ndifferences of the radioactive parent\/radiogenic daughter\n(P\/D) ratios (e.g., Rb\/Sr, Sm\/Nd, U\/Pb, and Th\/Pb) in their\nultimate mantle sources which, with time and the implicit\nassumption of a two-stage development, evolve to distinc-\ntive fields in isotope ratio spaces. Significant fractionation\nof parent\/daughter (P\/D) ratios in the solid state is unlikely\nin the deep mantle due to extremely slow diffusion [e.g.,\nHofmann and Hart, 1978], hence it is logical to suspect that\nprocesses known to occur in the upper mantle and crust\n(e.g., partial melting and magma evolution, dehydration,\nalteration\/metamorphism, differential weathering, transport\nand sedimentation) are the likely causes of any P\/D fractio-\nnation, recognizing that partial melting might also be a\nfactor in the transition zone and lower mantle [e.g., Lith-\ngow-Bertelloni and Stixrude, 2000; Hirose et al., 1999;\nHirose and Fei, 2002]. These shallow or near-surface P\/D-\nfractionated materials are then introduced into mantle sour-\nces of oceanic basalts through subduction zones. Mantle\ncompositional heterogeneity is thus a general consequence\nof plate tectonics because of crust-mantle recycling.\n[3] Among many contributions endeavoring to understand\nthe origin of mantle compositional heterogeneity in the\ncontext of plate tectonics is the classic paper by Hofmann\nand White [1982, p. 421], who proposed that \u2018\u2018oceanic crust\nis returned to the mantle during subduction . . . Eventually, it\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

While some details are considered conjec-\ntural, the principal idea of the model has been widely\naccepted by the solid Earth community as being, to a first\norder, correct [e.g., Hofmann, 1988, 1997; Chauvel et al.,\n1992; Hauri, 1996; Hauri et al., 1996; Rehka\u00a8mper and\nHofmann, 1997; Niu and Batiza, 1997; Lassiter and Hauri,\n1998; Sobolev et al., 2000; Cordery et al., 1997; Leitch and\nDavies, 2001]. In this paper, instead of reviewing numerous\nworks following this line in the literature, we argue that there\nis no obvious association between ancient subducted oceanic\ncrusts and source materials of OIB. Our arguments are based\non well-understood petrological processes, geochemical\nobservations, and recent experimental results on mineral\nphysics under deep mantle conditions [e.g., Agee, 1998;\nOhtani and Maeda, 2001].\n[4] The arguments in this paper will need to be consid-\nered in future models of chemical geodynamics and mantle\nconvection. The concept of mantle metasomatism that has\nexisted in the literature for decades remains valid in explain-\ning many aspects of enriched geochemical signatures in\nOIB and some enriched MORB (E-MORB) [e.g., Green,\n1971; Sun and Hanson, 1975; Frey and Green, 1974, 1978;\nWood, 1979; Le Roex et al., 1983; Anderson, 1989, 1994;\nSun and McDonough, 1989; McKenzie, 1989; Halliday et\nal., 1995; Niu et al., 1996, 1999]. Following Niu et al\n[2002a], we illustrate explicitly that the interface between\nthe low-velocity zone (LVZ) and the cooling and thickening\noceanic lithosphere is the most likely location where such\nmetasomatism takes place, and we argue that the subducted\nmetasomatized portions of deep oceanic lithosphere are the\nbest candidates for the ultimate sources feeding hot spot\nvolcanisms.\n2. Petrological and Geochemical Arguments\n2.1. Melting of Subducted Oceanic Crusts Unable\nto Produce High-Magnesian OIB Melts\n[5] Christensen and Hofmann [1994] explored physical\nscenarios in which subducted oceanic crust might segregate\nfrom the attached lithospheric mantle at the bottom of the\nlower mantle during mantle convection so as to form deep-\nrooted plumes to rise and feed hot spot volcanism in the\nupper mantle. Yasuda and Fujii [1998] made a similar effort\nfor shallower depths. Average bulk oceanic crust is picritic\/\nbasaltic in composition and is likely to have no more than\n\u000113 wt % MgO [e.g., Niu, 1997]. Such crust cannot, by\nmelting, produce the high-magnesian picritic lavas seen in\nmany OIB suites. For example, high-magnesian glasses of\n15 wt % MgO [Clague et al., 1991] or more [Norman and\nGarcia, 1999] have been observed in Hawaiian shield\npicrites. Basaltic melts are derived from more magnesian\npicritic melts produced by partial melting of mantle peri-\ndotites [e.g., O\u2019Hara, 1968a, 1968b; Stolper, 1980; Falloon\net al., 1988; Herzberg and O\u2019Hara, 1998, 2002; O\u2019Hara\nand Herzberg, 2002]. Partial melting of recycled oceanic\ncrust, which is basaltic\/picritic in composition [e.g., Niu,\n1997] and quartz-eclogite or eclogite in petrology [e.g.,\nO\u2019Hara and Yoder, 1967; O\u2019Hara and Herzberg, 2002],\nwill not produce basaltic\/picritic melts but will produce\nmelts of more silicic composition [e.g., Green and Ring-\nwood, 1968; Wyllie, 1970]. If total melting had occurred\n(physically unlikely), the melts would be basaltic\/picritic in\ncomposition, but would still differ in both major and trace\nelement systematics from those of average OIB. It is\npossible that ancient oceanic crust is more magnesian than\nthe present-day equivalent because of hotter potential man-\ntle temperatures and thus greater extents of melting in the\nArchean and Proterozoic, but it is, in principle, not possible\nto partially melt picrites to produce picrites. In fact, primary\nOIB melts must be more magnesian than most primitive\npicrite melts (>15% MgO) observed in Hawaii and other\nOIB suites [Herzberg and O\u2019Hara, 1998, 2002]. Therefore\npetrologically ancient recycled oceanic crusts cannot\nbecome sources feeding hot spot volcanism and OIB. One\nmay argue that OIB are derived from melts of recycled\noceanic crusts mixed with predominantly peridotite melts\n[e.g., Chauvel et al., 1992]. This is possible and will\napparently relax the OIB MgO requirement, but then OIB\nare no longer derived from recycled oceanic crust alone.\n2.2. Ancient Oceanic Crusts Isotopically\nToo Depleted to Yield OIB\n[6] It is generally thought that MORB are derived from a\nmantle source that was depleted in incompatible elements\nearly in Earth\u2019s history as a result of extraction of the\nincompatible-element-enriched continental crust [e.g., Arm-\nstrong, 1968; Gast, 1968; O\u2019Nions et al., 1979; Jacobsen\nand Wasserburg, 1979; DePaolo, 1980; Alle`gre et al.,\n1983]. This early differentiation is postulated to have\nresulted in a relatively homogeneous mantle, from which\nthe depleted mantle (DM) source for MORB and the more\nenriched source for OIB were then produced over a long\nperiod principally by the subduction of oceanic crust [e.g.,\nHofmann and White, 1982; Hofmann et al., 1986; Hofmann,\n1988, 1997]. A simple way to test the hypothesis whether\nancient recycled oceanic crusts can serve as enriched\nsources for OIB is to see what the isotopic signatures of\nthose ancient recycled oceanic crusts would be at present\nand ask whether they are consistent with those of present-\nday OIB. This test rejects the hypothesis as illustrated in\nFigure 1 and detailed below.\n[7] To avoid ambiguous conclusions, we use simple Sr-\nNd-Hf isotopic systems as opposed to complex Pb or poorly\nunderstood Os isotopic systems and the noble gasses. This\nstrategy is logical because if the hypothesis fails for simple\nsystems, interpretations in favor of that hypothesis based on\ncomplex systems must also fail. For simplicity, we also\nassume that ancient subducted oceanic crusts experienced\nno subduction zone dehydration (the effects of which we\nconsider separately below). It is likely that continental crust\nhas been accreted episodically from \u00014.0 Ga to the present\n[e.g., McCulloch and Bennett, 1998], in which case the\nEarth\u2019s mantle would be depleted progressively during this\nsame long period. The mean age of the continental crust is\nabout 2.0\u20132.5 Ga [e.g., Jacobsen and Wasserburg, 1979;\nTaylor and McLennan, 1985]; hence we can assume a\nsimilar mean age for the depleted mantle. Using the\nECV 5 - 2 NIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS\ndepleted MORB melts from the Garrett Transform in the\nPacific [Niu and He\u00b4kinian, 1997; Wendt et al., 1999] as\nrepresenting the DM (eSr = \u000232, eNd = 12, and estimated\neHf = 24), we can calculate the evolution curves of the DM\nwhich differentiated from the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) or\nprimitive mantle (PM) at \u00012.5 Ga as a result of continental\ncrust extraction (the choice of this particular composition\nfor the DM is not critical). In the plots of eSr, eNd, and eHf\nversus time in Figure 1 these curves are labeled 1. Given the\nknown composition of the present-day DM and the decay\nconstants of the radioactive parents (i.e., 87Rb, 147Sm, and\n176Lu), the P\/D ratios (i.e., 87Rb\/87Sr, 147Sm\/143Nd, and\n176Lu\/176Hf) of the DM along these curves are then con-\nstrained at any given time in the last 2.5 Gyr.\n[8] The significant coupling between radiogenic isotopes\nand incompatible element abundances and ratios in many\nOIB suites, seamount lavas, and MORB [e.g., Saunders et\nal., 1988; Sun and McDonough, 1989; Niu and Batiza, 1997;\nNiu et al., 1999, 2002a] suggests that the source materials of\nthese basalts are ancient and have developed their isotopic\ncharacteristics over a period in excess of 1.0 Gyr. If recycled\nancient oceanic crusts played a role in the source regions of\nthese oceanic basalts, then these ancient oceanic crusts\nwould have to be formed >1.0 Ga. Evolution curves of 2\nand 3 in Figure 1 represent these ancient oceanic crusts\nformed at 2.0 Ga and 1.0 Ga, respectively, from the DM by\n20% batch (equilibrium partial) melting using values for the\neffective bulk distribution coefficients, D, given in Table 1.\nSuch calculations are rather simplistic and effective bulk D\ncan vary substantially [e.g., O\u2019Hara, 2000, O\u2019Hara and\nHerzberg, 2002], but more complex models do not change\nthe conclusion of the test; 20% melting is higher than a\nmean value of 15% melting beneath present-day ocean\nridges [Niu, 1997] but is reasonable given the hotter mantle\nin the past. Again, different choices of extent of melting do\nnot affect the conclusion of the test. Figure 1 shows that the\nisotopic compositions (rectangles on the left vertical axes)\nof these ancient ocean crusts are quite depleted after 2.0 Ga\nand 1.0 Ga evolution with eSr <\u000224, eNd > 8.4, and eHf > 19.\nThey are, on average, much more depleted than most of the\npresent-day OIB [Albare`de, 1995; Salters and White, 1998]\nwith eSr > \u000220, eNd < 6, and eHf < 12 given as histograms\nalong vertical axes to the right. Curves 4 and 5 represent the\nevolution paths if ocean crust of present-day mean compo-\nsition (Table 1) had been injected into the Earth\u2019s mantle at\n2.0 Ga or 1.0 Ga, respectively. This is equivalent to assum-\ning different DM ages and P\/D ratios. These paths are\nobviously more depleted in eSr because of low Rb\/Sr ratio\nof the present-day mean oceanic crust with respect to old\nDM, similar in eNd (similar Sm\/Nd ratio) to that of DM, but\nastonishingly display a more enriched character in eHf due to\nthe low Lu\/Hf ratio relative to DM. The \u2018\u2018odd\u2019\u2019 Hf isotopes\nreflects the fact that depleted MORB (or bulk ocean crust)\noften has greater depletion in heavy rare earth elements\n(REE, e.g., Lu) than middle REE and elements like Zr and\nHf (see later). Curves 4 and 5 illustrate the concept, but there\nare old ophiolitic basalts that are as depleted as present\nocean crust [e.g., Bruce et al., 2000]. Changing the mean\nage of the DM to >2.5 Ga, 3 Ga, or 3.5 Ga will not change\nthe conclusion reached here.\n[9] Large databases for MORB and OIB exist [e.g.,\nLehnert et al., 2000], and in particular, high-quality data\nsets on Hf isotopes that have been difficult to collect by\nthermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) have also\nbegun to appear (although not yet openly available) thanks\nto multichannel inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrom-\netry (MC-ICP-MS) [e.g., Blichert-Toft and Albare`de, 1997;\nVervoort and Blichert-Toft, 1999; Vervoort et al., 1999,\n2000; Albare`de and van der Hilst, 2002]. However, the\ntwo data sets we use in Figure 1 (and Figures 4 and 5 in\nsection 2.4) are adequate for the purpose of the paper\nbecause these two data sets define the same trends and\ncover the same spread as the large database seen in the\nrecent literature. For example, the island-averaged data for\nSr-Nd isotopes in the compilation of Albare`de [1995] define\nthe mantle array and reveal clearly the first-order global\nsystematics. The Nd-Hf isotopic data reported by Salters\nand White [1998] on many OIB also define the mantle or\n\u2018\u2018terrestrial\u2019\u2019 array [Vervoort et al., 1999] with global cover-\nage both geographically and in Nd-Hf isotope ratio space.\n2.3. Recycled Oceanic Crusts After Subduction\nZone Dehydration Unsuitable as Sources for OIB\n[10] The ocean crust is altered by hydrothermal activity\nduring its accretion at ocean ridges and pervasively weath-\nered\/hydrated subsequently on the seafloor. In a widely\naccepted model, this crust that is on top of the subducting\nslab endures the greatest extents of dehydration in sub-\nduction zones. Fluids released from this dehydration lower\nthe solidus of the overlying mantle wedge, which then\nmelts to produce arc lavas. The incompatible element\ngeochemical signatures of arc lavas largely reflect the\nsignatures of this subducting slab \u2018\u2018component\u2019\u2019 [e.g., Gill,\n1981; Tatsumi et al., 1986; McCulloch and Gamble, 1991;\nStolper and Newman, 1994; Hawkins, 1995; Pearce and\nPeate, 1995; Davidson, 1996; Tatsumi and Kogiso, 1997;\nEwart et al., 1998]. The slab \u2018\u2018component\u2019\u2019 may include\nelements of altered ocean crust, and pelagic or terrigenous\nsediments [e.g., Plank and Langmuir, 1993, 1998; Elliott et\nal., 1997; Class et al., 2001], but the fluids and the fluid-\nsoluble elements (e.g., Ba, Cs, Rb, U, K, Pb, Sr) released\ncontribute the most to the petrogenesis of arc lavas (see\nFigures 2 and 3a). If this widely accepted interpretation of\nIAB genesis is correct, at least to a first order, then the\nresidual subducted crust that has passed through subduction\nzone dehydration reactions will have geochemical signa-\ntures for the fluid-soluble elements that are complementary\nto the signatures of arc lavas [e.g., McDonough, 1991; Niu\net al., 1999, 2002a]. This residual crust should be relatively\nenriched in water-insoluble or immobile incompatible ele-\nments (e.g., Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and Ti) and highly depleted in\nwater-soluble or mobile incompatible elements (e.g., Ba,\nRb, Cs, Th, U, K, Sr, Pb) (Figure 3b). It follows that if the\nrecycled oceanic crust were the major source of OIB, then\nthese latter basalts should be highly depleted in these water-\nsoluble incompatible elements. However, OIB are enriched\nnot only in these water-soluble incompatible elements but\nalso in water-insoluble incompatible elements relative to\nmean ocean crust (Figures 2 and 3a).\n[11] Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the argument by comparing\nthe average OIB [Sun and McDonough, 1989], average E-\nMORB [Niu et al., 2002a], and average western Pacific\nIsland arc tholeiites (IAB) with average ocean crust (the first\nthree are normalized to bulk ocean crust; see Table 1 for\nNIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS ECV 5 - 3\ndetails). The OIB and E-MORB are progressively more\nenriched in the more incompatible elements than average\nocean crust, whereas the IAB is depleted in REEs, and\nsignificantly more so in water-insoluble incompatible ele-\nments, but enriched in water-soluble incompatible elements.\nFigure 3b shows schematically the geochemical signatures\nthat average recycled residual oceanic crust should hold\nafter passing through subduction zone dehydration reac-\ntions. Assuming heavy REEs are less affected by the\nsubduction zone dehydration, then the contrast in both\nrelative abundances (qualitatively) and patterns of incom-\npatible elements between average OIB\/E-MORB and the\nECV 5 - 4 NIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS\nrecycled residual crust is extraordinary. To melt or partially\nmelt recycled ocean crust with such residual geochemical\nsignatures cannot produce OIB or E-MORB unless this\nresidual crust were refertilized within the mantle by adding\nsignificant amounts of Ba, Rb, Cs, Th, U, K, Pb, and Sr and\nlesser amounts of Nb, Ta, LREEs, Zr, and Hf, i.e., the\nreverse of subduction zone dehydration. Such postulated\nrefertilization is ad hoc.\n[12] Recycled terrigenous sediments would be enriched in\nthese water-soluble elements, but they dehydrate or even\nmelt in subduction zones, contributing to arc volcanism\n[Plank and Langmuir, 1998; Elliot et al., 1997]. If the\nsubducted terrigenous sediments neither dehydrated nor\nmelted, their presence in the source regions of oceanic\nbasalts would still fail to explain the elevated Ce\/Pb and\nNb\/U ratios in most oceanic basalts [Hofmann et al., 1986;\nNiu et al., 1999]. Furthermore, terrigenous sediments with\ndetrital zircon crystals will lead to Zr-Hf fractionation from\nREE and Hf isotopes [Patchett et al., 1984; White et al.,\n1986; Vervoort et al., 1999], an effect which is not observed\nin OIB (see below).\n2.4. OIB Sr-Nd-Hf Isotopes Lacking Subduction\nZone Dehydration Signatures\n[13] If ancient subducted oceanic crusts had indeed\nplayed an important role in the petrogenesis of OIB, then\nisotopic signatures of nonmagmatic subduction zone dehy-\ndration processes must be preserved in OIB. This is,\nhowever, not observed. Figure 4 demonstrates the argu-\nments using island-averaged data compiled by Albare`de\n[1995] for Sr and Nd isotopes and a number of OIB suites\nwith global coverage reported by Salters and White [1998]\nfor Nd and Hf isotopes (also see Figure 1 and discussion\nabove). Figure 4a plots averages of 40 OIB suites in eSr \u0002\neNd space, each representing average composition of an\nocean island (or islands). Except for three EM2 OIB suites\n(Samoa, Society, and Azores) and one HIMU OIB suite (St.\nHelena), all other 36 OIB suites define a scattered, yet\nstatistically significant (at >99.9% confidence levels)\ninverse linear trend. Figure 4b plots a number of OIB suites\nin eHf \u0002 eNd space. Except for the two HIMU Islands (St.\nHelena and Tubaii), the data define a statistically significant\n(>99.9% confidence levels) positive linear trend. Given the\nrelatively minor occurrences of EM2 and HIMU OIB suites\non a global scale, we first focus our discussion on the\nmajority of OIB suites here and discuss the implications of\nthe EM2 and HIMU OIB suites later.\n[14] Because of the large differences in relative mobility\nof Rb > Sr > Nd > Sm > Lu > Hf during subduction\ndehydration inferred from observations (Table 1) and deter-\nmined experimentally [Kogiso et al., 1997], the significant\ncorrelations in Figures 4a and 4b would not exist or would\nhave been destroyed if sources of these OIB had been\ninvolved in, or actually part of, ancient oceanic crusts\npassing through subduction zone dehydration reactions.\nThe significant correlations thus suggest that (1) elements\nSr, Nd, and Hf have behaved similarly in the respective\nsources of these OIB in the past >1.0 Gyr; (2) the similar\nbehavior would be unlikely if these OIB sources had\nexperienced subduction zone dehydration but is entirely\nexpected if the process or processes these OIB sources had\nexperienced are magmatic because of the similar effective\nbulk D of these elements (Table 1); and (3) coupled corre-\nlations of P\/D ratios such as Rb\/Sr, Sm\/Nd, and Lu\/Hf in\nthese OIB sources must also have persisted undisturbed in\nthe last >1.0 Gyr. Figure 5 shows the same plots as in\nFigure 4 on expanded scales to include a number of addi-\ntional items. The numbered diamonds are the model results\nof Figure 1. Ancient oceanic crusts produced 2.0 and 1.0 Gyr\nago (labeled 2 and 3, respectively) from the DM plot at the\nmost depleted end of the OIB arrays and thus cannot be\nsources of OIB as concluded above. The arrows point in the\ndirection of the effect of subduction zone dehydration. The\nlatter makes ancient recycled oceanic crusts even less likely\nas sources of OIB. The aging or radioactive decay of ocean\ncrust with present-day composition (Figure 1) if injected in\nFigure 1. (opposite) Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic evolution of depleted mantle and ancient oceanic crusts using epsilon\nnotations. The horizontal lines with eSr, eNd, and eHf values of 0 are evolution paths of chondrite uniform reservoir (CHUR),\nwhich is often used as representing bulk silicate earth (BSE) or primitive mantle (PM), i.e., mantle plus crust as the Earth\u2019s\ncore probably does not take Rb, Sr, Sm, Nd, Lu, and Hf in significant amount. The recommended CHUR values for Sr and\nNd isotopes used for calculations are from Faure [1986] and Dickin [1997], who give detailed discussions and ultimate\nsources: 87Sr\/86Srtoday = 0.70450,\n87Sr\/86Sr4.55Ga = 0.69897, and\n87Rb\/86Srtoday = 0.0827;\n143Nd\/144Ndtoday = 0.512638,\n143Nd\/144Nd4.55Ga = 0.506697, and\n147Sm\/143Ndtoday = 0.1967. The CHUR values for Hf isotopes are from Blichert-Toft\nand Albare`de [1997]: 176Hf\/177Hftoday = 0.282772,\n176Hf\/177Hf4.55Ga = 0.279742, and\n176Lu\/177Hftoday = 0.0332. The\nrelevant decay constants are taken from Dickin [1997]. Epsilon values are calculated using the general formula (use eNd as\nan example): eNd (t) = (\n143Nd\/144Nd(t,sample)\/\n143Nd\/144Nd(t,CHUR) \u0002 1) \u0003 10,000, where t represents time that varies from\nzero today to the age of the Earth of 4.55 Ga. The depleted mantle (DM) uses the average values of highly depleted lavas\nfrom the Garrett Transform in the Pacific [Niu and He\u00b4kinian, 1997; Wendt et al., 1999]: eSr = \u000232 (87Sr\/86Sr = 0.702245)\neNd = 12 (\n143Nd\/144Nd = 0.513254), and estimated values for eHf = 24 (\n176Hf\/177Hf = 0.283451) from the eNd\u0002eNf\nrelationship in Figure 4. Curve 1 represents evolution of the DM, which differentiated from BSE 2.5 Ga. Curves 2 and 3 are\nevolution paths of ancient oceanic crusts formed from the DM 2.0 Ga and 1.0 Ga, respectively. Curves 4 and 5 are\nevolution paths the ocean crust of present composition (Table 1) would have if it had aged\/decayed since 2.0 Ga and 1.0 Ga,\nrespectively. Compared with the present-day OIB isotopic compositions given as histograms on vertical axes to the right, it\nis obvious that ancient subducted oceanic crusts (curves 2 and 3) that evolved to today (rectangles on the left axes) are too\ndepleted to be sources of most present-day OIB. Note that the low eHf values for curves 4 and 5 result form the low Lu\/Hf\nratios of the mean ocean crust which has a slightly greater depletion in heavy REEs (including Lu) than middle REEs and\nsimilarly incompatible elements like Hf. The present-day Sr-Nd-Hf isotope data for OIB are from Albare`de [1995] and\nSalters and White [1998].\nNIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS ECV 5 - 5\nTable 1.

Adding lower crust dilutes the\nabundances of most tabulated elements in N-MORB by, on average, a factor of 3.2445 (\u2018\u2018bulk crust\u2019\u2019 = 3.2445 \u0003 N-MORB with R = 0.995) without\nsignificantly affecting elemental ratios except for Th, Nb, Ta, K, Pb, Sr and Eu. However, the conclusions of the paper are not affected whether or not using\nlower crust gabbros. Nevertheless, \u2018\u2018bulk ocean crust\u2019\u2019 composition is used throughout the paper.\ngEffective bulk distribution coefficients for the tabulated elements are determined by relative variability (defined as RSD% = 1s\/meanx100) of MORB\ndata (Niu and Batiza [1997]; Niu et al [1999, 2002a], which is proportional to relative incompatibility, by assuming D for Ba being close to zero while D for\nheavy rare earth elements being about 0.2997 determined from various published Kd data and polybaric melting reaction of Niu [1997]. The latter assumes\nmelting in the spinel lherzolite stability field, which for the majority of N-MORB is reasonable.\nhBy normalizing mobile element abundances with respect to the abundances of immobile elements such as Nb, and by comparing IAB with average\nocean crust, we can take ratios as reflecting and proportional to the mobility of these elements under subduction zone dehydration reactions.\nECV 5 - 6 NIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS\nthe mantle at 2.0 and 1.0 Ga (labeled 4 and 5), respectively,\nwould produce odd isotopic ratios that have not been\nobserved anywhere in terrestrial rocks.\n[15] The linear trends in Figures 4 and 5 pass through the\naccepted chondritic or BSE values in the eSr \u0002 eNd space but\npass above the BSE values in the eHf \u0002 eNd space. It is\npossible that the present-day chondritic value of\n176Hf\/177HfCH, today = 0.282772 [Blichert-Toft and Albare`de,\n1997] may be lower than expected although it is not yet\nknown what the ideal value should be [Vervoort et al., 1999].\nIf the value of 176Hf\/177HfCH, today = 0.282818 [Patchett,\n1983] were used, the eHf values for all the samples would be\n1.63 units lower, and the data trend would perfectly pass\nthrough this latter chondritic value. The linear trends defined\nby the majority of the data in the two spaces are commonly\ninterpreted as mixing trends between DM and an enriched\nend-member that is more enriched than BSE. We have done\nsuch an exercise by choosing two reasonable end-members\n(see Figure 5 caption for details). We get slightly curved\nFigure 2.

The point is that such\nsubduction zone filtered ocean crust is depleted in water-\nsoluble incompatible elements like Ba, Rb, Th, U, K, Pb,\nand Sr, while relatively enriched (or less depleted) in water-\ninsoluble incompatible elements like Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, and Ti.\nIt is not possible to melt such residual crust to produce OIB\nor E-MORB unless the residual crust had been refertilized\nin its postsubduction history by some ad hoc processes as\nindicated by the vertical arrows.\nFigure 4.

The arrays pass through (in Figure 4a) and 1.63\neHf unit above (in Figure 4b) the recommended CHUR\nvalues (Figure 1). The linear trends suggest that the process\nor processes that have led to the trends may be simple. The\nEM2 and HIMU OIB suites may be genetically different.\nNote also that the 3 EM2 and 1 HIMU OIB suites define a\nsignificant linear trend in Figure 4a.\nNIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS ECV 5 - 7\nFigure 5. Same plots as in Figure 4 with expanded scales to include some simple model results. The\ndiamonds are model results from Figure 1 as labeled. The arrows with the diamonds pointing to the effect\nof subduction zone dehydration reactions, which removes more Rb than Sr, more Nd than Sm, and\nprobably have little effect on Lu and Hf, thus leading to decreasing eSr, increasing eNd and essentially no\nchange in eHf during post subduction isotopic evolution. As the linear trends in 2-D spaces are often\ninterpreted as resulting from binary mixing, we have done such an exercise as indicated by the hyperbolic\ncurves with 10% increments labeled with pluses between a depleted (D) and an enriched (E) end-\nmembers. The average of highly depleted MORB melts from the Garrett Transform in the Pacific (see\nFigure 1) is chosen as D with 82 ppm Sr, 5.95 ppm Nd, and 1.58 ppm Hf. E is arbitrarily chosen to\nenclose isotopically most enriched OIB suites along the linear trends in Figure 4, and has 600 ppm Sr,\n38.5 ppm Nd, and 7.8 ppm Hf [Sun and McDonough, 1989] with eSr = 14.52 (\n87Sr\/86Sr = 0.705523) eNd =\n\u00025.0 (143Nd\/144Nd = 0.512382), and estimated values for eHf = \u00027.00 (176Hf\/177Hf = 0.282574). Note\nthat the curvatures and increments are identical in this case if source mixing is invoked. Also, the\ncurvatures remain quite similar if another set of reasonable Sr, Nd, and Hf concentration values are used.\nThe deviation of the mixing curvatures from the linear data trends indicates that mixing is not a logical\nexplanation; all these OIB suites are spatially (globally) unrelated. The MORB field, the ranges of EM1\nand EM2 are from Salters and White [1998]. Note that the 3 EM2 suites and 1 HIMU suite in Figure 5a\ndefine a linear trend, but in Figure 5b, while HIMU OIB suites are below the linear trend, both HIMU and\nEM2 suites have a similar eNd and eHf range in a broad sense, indicating that their sources have similar\nmiddle-to-heavy REE patterns despite different Rb\/Sr (also U\/Pb) ratios.\nECV 5 - 8 NIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS\nhyperbolic mixing lines on both plots.

The apparent deviation of the\nmixing lines from the data trends would conventionally\nsuggest a missing component that is unsampled by oceanic\nbasalts, and that must be located somewhere lower left and\nlower right relative to the data trends in Figures 5a and 5b,\nrespectively. Such a hidden component may indeed exist\n[McDonough, 1991; Rudnick et al., 2000; Blichert-Toft and\nAlbare`de, 1997; Albare`de and van der Hilst, 2002] as will be\ndiscussed later. Vervoort et al. [1999] argued that the mantle\narray will pass through the BSE values in the eHf\u0002 eNd space\nif a higher 176Hf\/177HfCH,today value is used, in which case a\nhidden component would not be required. However, the\nmixing lines are necessarily curved if proper end-member\ncompositions are chosen [Albare`de and van der Hilst, 2002].\nTherefore the choice of 176Hf\/177HfCH,today value is not a\nvalid argument for or against the presence of a hidden\ncomponent.\n[16] Given the similar effective bulk D of Sr, Nd, and Hf\nin crystal-liquid processes, we suggest that this simple\nprocess is magmatic. Extraction of the bulk continental\ncrust that depleted parts of the mantle, for example, is\nmostly a magmatic process. Small amounts of low mass\nfraction (low-F) partial melt may form at the core-mantle\nboundary [e.g., Williams and Garnero, 1996] or in the low-\nvelocity zone (LVZ [e.g., Niu et al., 2002a]). This low-F\nmelt with high Rb\/Sr, and low Sm\/Nd and Lu\/Hf ratios will\nbe an important metasomatic agent that ascends and refer-\ntilizes, to variable extents, the DM, and less depleted or\nperhaps even undifferentiated mantle. This would lead to\ndifferent mean Sr, Nd, and Hf isotopic signatures in the\nsource regions of different OIB suites and to the linear\ncorrelations in Figures 4 and 5. We suggest that the linear\ntrends result from such magmatic low-degree melt metaso-\nmatism, but the scatter about the linear trends is a function\nof the age of the refertilization and also possibly the small\ndifferences in the composition of both premetasomatized\nmantle and low-degree melts.\n[17] Although their rocks are relatively minor in abun-\ndance, the deviation of EM2 and HIMU OIB suites from the\nmain linear OIB trends in Figures 4 and 5 needs some\nattention. In particular, the three EM2 OIB suites and the St\nHelena HIMU OIB suite define a simple linear trend\n(Figures 4a and 5a) that is statistically significant (>98%\nconfidence level). This suggests that their origin may be\nsomehow related. It is generally thought that EM2 OIB\nreflect melting of recycled terrigenous sediments [e.g.,\nWeaver, 1991; Hofmann, 1997], whereas HIMU OIB result\nfrom melting of recycled oceanic crust [e.g., Hofmann,\n1997]. These interpretations are favored by interpretations\nof oxygen isotope studies [Eiler et al., 1997]. It is important\nto note that neither EM2 nor HIMU OIB suites show trace\nelement patterns [Weaver, 1991] that are consistent with\ngoing through subduction zone dehydration reactions (see\nFigure 3b). Contamination by altered oceanic crust and\nsediment within the superstructure of the volcanoes may\nbe a factor [O\u2019Hara, 1998], but the only physical scenario\nin which terrigenous sediments and \u2018\u2018ocean crust\u2019\u2019 may be\nintroduced into the mantle source region without possibly\nexperiencing subduction zone dehydration is where a sub-\nduction zone begins to initiate along passive continental\nmargins [Niu et al., 2001a, 2003]. Many parts of passive\nmargins are characterized by \u2018\u2018seaward dipping reflectors,\u2019\u2019\nthe thick sequences of volcanics and intrusives associated\nwith continental breakup [Eldholm and Coffin, 2000]. Parts\nof the sequences overlie the oldest oceanic lithosphere\n(denser than continental lithosphere and oceanic plateau\nroots [Niu et al., 2001a, 2003]). Such magmatic construc-\ntions are unlikely to have been as heavily altered and\nhydrated as normal oceanic crust, and thus should not have\nexperienced significant dehydration when subducted as\nmetamorphosed dense eclogites, along with the terrigenous\nsediments, into the mantle.\n3. Mineral Physics Arguments\n[18] One of the great achievements in mantle tomo-\ngraphic studies in recent years is the consensus that sub-\nducting oceanic lithosphere can indeed penetrate the 660 km\nseismic discontinuity (660-D) into the lower mantle [van\nder Hist et al., 1997; Grand et al., 1997]. This supports the\nwhole mantle convection model and the proposal that\nmantle plumes originate from the core-mantle boundary\n[e.g., Griffiths and Campbell, 1990; Davies and Richards,\n1992]. This also lends support to the model by Hofmann\nand White [1982] that ancient oceanic crusts may be heated\nand segregated from the ambient mantle at the core-mantle\nboundary [Christensen and Hofmann, 1994], feeding man-\ntle plumes and hot spot volcanism. To balance the down-\nward flow of subduction, upward mass transfer from the\nlower mantle to the upper mantle is required. It is possible\nthat plume flux from the deep mantle is the most important\nupward flow that feeds the upper mantle and also possibly\nthe sources of oceanic basalts [Phipps Morgan et al., 1995;\nNiu et al., 1999], but it is also viable that the upward mass\ntransfer takes place in the form of regional \u2018\u2018swell\u2019\u2019 across\nthe 660-D. In either scenario, the fundamental question is\nwhether or not the ancient oceanic crust, if subducted into\nthe lower mantle, can return to the upper mantle source\nregions of oceanic basalts. Recent mineral physics studies\nsuggest that this is improbable.\n3.1. Subducted Oceanic Crusts Too Dense in the\nLower Mantle Conditions to Rise to the Upper Mantle\n[19] Ono et al. [2001] have shown that subducted basaltic\noceanic crust turns into an assemblage of stishovite (\u000124 vol\n%), Mg-perovskite (\u000133%), Ca-perovskite (\u000123%), and Ca-\nferrite (\u000120%) at pressures equivalent to 800\u2013950 km\ndepths, which is in the upper portion of the lower mantle.\nThis assemblage has a bulk density significantly greater than\nthe ambient peridotitic mantle. Figure 6 summarizes their\nresults by comparing the bulk density of oceanic crust with\nthat of mantle peridotite under shallow lower mantle con-\nditions as a function of depth. Assuming a whole mantle\nconvection scenario, and considering a depth of 780 km, the\ntemperature of \u00012000 K at this depth is reasonable. In this\ncase, the subducted oceanic crust is >2.3% denser than the\nambient peridotite mantle. Such huge negative buoyancy will\nimpede the ascent of the subducted oceanic crust to the upper\nmantle. If the crustal portion of the subducted lithosphere\nwere segregated at greater depths as proposed [Christensen\nand Hofmann, 1994], then this crust would only rise to the\nlevel of neutral buoyancy, which is at depths of about 1600\nNIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS ECV 5 - 9\nkm [Kesson et al., 1998; Ono et al., 2001]. If the observed\nseismological heterogeneity at this and deeper depths [e.g.,\nKaneshima and Helffrich, 1999;Kellogg et al., 1999; van der\nHilst and Ka\u00b4rason, 1999; Albare`de and van der Hilst, 2002]\nis indeed controlled by the level of neutral buoyancy, then it is\nunlikely that solid oceanic crust subducted to the core-mantle\nboundary will ever return as solid materials to the upper\nmantle source regions of oceanic basalts.\n[20] In this context, subducted oceanic crust under lower\nmantle conditions should have greater seismic velocities\nthan the ambient peridotitic mantle. This is because the\nsubducted crustal lithologies have abundant high-velocity\nminerals such as Al-rich Mg-perovskite, Al-rich Ca-ferrite,\nand importantly stishovite [e.g., Ono et al., 2001; Anderson,\n1989], whereas the ambient peridotite mantle lacks these\nphases and has abundant low-velocity minerals like magne-\nsiowu\u00a8stite [e.g., Anderson, 1989]. This suggests that the\nwidespread small (<10 km) bodies detected using seismic\nscatter waves in the lower mantle [e.g., Hedlin et al., 1997]\nare not fragments of subducted oceanic crust contrary to\nsome interpretations [Kaneshima and Helffrich, 1999; Helf-\nfrich and Wood, 2001] because these bodies have seismic\nvelocities up to 4% slower, not faster, than their surround-\nings [Helffrich and Wood, 2001].\n3.2. Basaltic Melts in Lower Mantle Conditions\nProbably Denser Than Ambient Solid Peridotites\n[21] As rocks of basaltic compositions have lower melt-\ning temperatures than peridotitic materials in lower mantle\nconditions [e.g., Hirose et al., 1999; Hirose and Fei, 2002],\nsubducted oceanic crust may melt preferentially, as\ndetected seismically in the seismic D\u2019\u2019 region near the\ncore-mantle boundary [Williams and Garnero, 1996]. It\nmay thus be argued that subducted oceanic crusts may\npartially or totally melt in the deep lower mantle and the\nmelt might then rise to the upper mantle source regions of\noceanic basalts. This argument, however, is unsupported by\npresently available knowledge.\n[22] Agee [1998, p. 107] noted the following:\nEquilibrium liquidus crystals will float in variety of terrestrial and\nlunar magmas within a wide range of mantle depths. Density\ninversions exist for ultrabasic mantle melts and olivine at depths\nbetween 245 and 500 km in the Earth. Olivine flotation occurs in\nhigh-Ti basalts at \u0001400 km in the lunar mantle. Basaltic and\nkomatiitic magmas have density inversions with garnet in the upper\nmantle transition zone and perovskite in the lower mantle.\nPeridotitic magma, because of its comparatively large bulk modulus\n(KT) and pressure derivative of the bulk modulus (K\u2019), is likely to be\nless dense than liquidus garnet and perovskite at all depths within\nthe Earth.\nThese suggestions are supported by other studies [Suzuki et\nal., 1998; Ohtani and Maeda, 2001]. Figure 7, which is\nFigure 6. Modified from Ono et al. [2001] (copyright\n2001, with permission from Elsevier Science) to show that\noceanic crust subducted into the lower mantle will be\ntransformed to a high-pressure mineral assemblage whose\nbulk rock density is significantly greater than the ambient\nperidotite mantle [Kennett et al., 1995]. For a whole mantel\nconvection scenario, the mantle temperature would be\n\u00012000 K at \u0001780 km. In this case, the oceanic crust, if\nsubducted into the lower mantle, would be >2.3% denser\nthan the ambient mantle. Such huge negative buoyancy\nimpedes the rise of subducted crust into the upper mantle\nsource regions of oceanic basalts.\nFigure 7. Modified from Agee [1998] reported at 3000\u0003C\nand Ohtani and Maeda [2001] reported at 4000 K (3727\u0003C)\nto show that if oceanic crust subducted into the lower\nmantle melted, this melt of basaltic composition would be\ndenser and progressively more so with depth than solid\nminerals of proper compositions (Mw, magnesiowu\u00a8stite, Pv,\nperovskite, where the numbers refer to Mg # = Mg\/[Mg +\nFe2 +]) and the bulk mantle peridotites at depths in excess\nof 1400 km. At depths approaching the core-mantle\nboundary where the melt may actually form, the basaltic\nmelt would be \u000115% denser than the bulk solid mantle.\nThis would suggest that subducted oceanic crust in the\nlower mantle cannot return to the upper mantle in the melt\nform. It must be stressed, however, that uncertainties\nassociated with both experiments and models are probably\nvery large, and the inferences drawn from these results thus\ncannot yet be validated without further experimental\ndemonstrations. The model solid mantle is from Kennett\net al. [1995], which is the same as the PREM model of\nDziewonski and Anderson [1981]. The shaded band is for\nmantle peridotite with Mg # = 0.89 [Ohtani and Maeda,\n2001]. The latter is significantly less dense than the model\nlower mantle, probably reflecting uncertainties.\nECV 5 - 10 NIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS\nmodified after Agee [1998] and Ohtani and Maeda [2001],\nillustrates the argument. A MORB melt (e.g., from total\nmelting of subducted oceanic crust) becomes denser, and\nprogressively more so as pressure increases, than solid\nmantle minerals (perovskite and magnesiowu\u00a8stite) and bulk\nmantle peridotite compositions at depths in excess of 1400\nkm. At depths close to the core-mantle boundary (or D\u2019\u2019\nregion), the MORB melt would be \u000115% denser than the\nbulk peridotitic solid mantle. The negative buoyancy of the\nMORB melt is so large that it is physically difficult for it to\nrise at all, let alone to arrive in the source regions of oceanic\nbasalts in the upper mantle even without considering the\nhazard of their freezing on the way up. Starting from the\npopular geochemical interpretation and widely accepted\nnotion of \u2018\u2018mantle plumes from ancient oceanic crust\u2019\u2019\n[Hofmann and White, 1982], Ohtani and Maeda [2001] had\nto invoke slab-derived water to lower the MORB melt\ndensity so that it could ascend as mantle plumes, but to\novercome a 15% negative buoyancy is difficult. Further-\nmore, the subducted crust, which is on top of the subducting\nlithosphere, experiences the greatest extents of dehydration\nin subduction zones, and subsequently is water poor. On the\nother hand, highly serpentinized peridotites, which are\nlikely the major lithology atop the lithospheric mantle\nbeneath the crust [Dick, 1989; Niu and He\u00b4kinian, 1997], can\ncontain up to 13% water. Serpentines can be stable up to\n7 GPa [Ulmer and Trommsdorff, 1995], and then trans-\nformed to dense hydrous phases to carry the water deep into\nthe lower mantle [Kuroda and Irifune, 1998]. Much of the\nwater introduced into the deep mantle will be physically and\ngenetically associated with recycled mantle peridotites, not\nrecycled crust. It is possible that a water-rich fluid could be\na free phase able to move around at such deep levels, but\nwhy subducted crusts should be the sinks for water released\nin this way is not immediately obvious.\n[23] Figure 7 also shows that peridotite melts are less\ndense than MORB melts and komatiitic melts, and, signifi-\ncantly, less dense than the solid mantle peridotites under the\nlower mantle conditions. Formation of peridotite melts at\ndeep mantle conditions may indeed be promoted by the\nsubducted water as discussed above. The peridotite melts\nare physically the best candidates to flow into the upper\nmantle, feeding hot spot volcanism, a process which would\nalso explain many petrological and geochemical observa-\ntions of OIB. For example, primitive OIB are quite magne-\nsian, a feature which could well be derived\/evolved from\nperidotite magmas formed in the lower mantle.\n[24] Melting experiments under uppermost lower mantle\nconditions (\u000125\u201327.5 GPa or \u0001700\u2013755 km) by Hirose\nand Fei [2002] provide some revealing perspectives on\npossible melt generations and ascent at these depths. They\nnoted that the temperature of the mantle at these depths is\nlower than the anhydrous melting (solidus) temperature of\nboth peridotite and MORB compositions. This suggests that\nthere would be no melt produced from either types of source\nmaterial at these depths without either the presence of water\n(including excess alkalis and other volatiles) or local ther-\nmal anomalies. If there were indeed melts produced at these\ndepths, these melts would then be less dense than the\nambient mantle (see Figure 7) [Suzuki et al., 1998; Agee,\n1998; Ohtani and Maeda, 2001], making it possible for\nthem to rise. Studying the melting phase relations at these\ndepths, Hirose and Fei produced partial melts for both\nperidotite (KLB-1) and basalt (MORB), with the composi-\ntions given in Table 2.\n[25] While DENSCAL [Niu and Batiza, 1991] suitable\nfor MORB and OIB is unlikely to be valid for calculating\ndensities of melts at these great pressures, we can readily\nsee that the melts produced by partial melting of MORB\ncomposition should be significantly denser than the melts\nby partial melting of peridotite. As MgO and FeO have the\nlargest bulk moduli (87.8 and 73.6 GPa, respectively) [e.g.,\nHerzberg, 1987] and also very large abundance differences\nbetween the two types of melts among all the major element\ncomponents, the bulk melt density depends, thus, largely on\nrelative abundances of FeO (heavy) and MgO (light) or\nFeO\/MgO ratios. This is indeed consistent with available\nknowledge (Figure 7) [Suzuki et al., 1998; Agee, 1998;\nOhtani and Maeda, 2001]. We thus can infer that if there\nwere melts produced at the top of the lower mantle, ultra-\nmafic melts will likely ascend readily, but melts produced\nby recycled crust (MORB compositions), if any, may not\nascend at all or ascend with difficulties.\n[26] How probable is melt production at these depths\ngiven the very high solidus temperatures (>2350\u0003C) of both\nperidotite (e.g., KLB-1) and MORB composition [e.g.,\nHerzberg and Zhang, 1996; Fei and Bertka, 1999; Hirose\net al., 1999; Irifune and Ringwood, 1993; Yasuda et al.,\n1994] relative to the likely geotherm of \u00011800\u20131900\u0003C\nestimated by Stacey [1992] to be most consistent with the\nPREM model of Dziewonski and Anderson [1981]? An\nexcess temperature of >400\u0003C is clearly required for any\nmelt to be produced if the mantle material at these depths is\ndry. Presence of water (accompanied by alkalis and other\nvolatiles) will relax this requirement, but much water will\nstill be needed to produce significant amounts of melts.\nRecycled oceanic crust which has passed through subduc-\ntion zone dehydration reactions (eclogites) will be dry, but\nthe underlying serpentinized lithospheric mantle may carry\nsignificant amount of water down to the lower mantle [e.g.,\nUlmer and Trommsdorff, 1995; Kuroda and Irifune, 1998].\nAs we discuss below, metasomatized deep portions of\nTable 2.

In\nsummary, volatile-bearing peridotites are better candidates\nthan recycled oceanic crust for the generation of melts atop\nthe lower mantle.\n4. Discussion\n[27] The foregoing demonstrates petrologically, geo-\nchemically, and in terms of mineral physics that recycled\noceanic crust cannot be the source of solid mantle plumes or\npartial melts feeding the bulk of hot spot volcanism and\nOIB. However, we cannot rule out entirely some material\ncontributions to OIB volcanism from recycled oceanic crust,\nterrigenous sediments, pelagic sediments, and other shallow\nand near-surface processed materials in which P\/D ratios\nand oxygen isotopes may have been fractionated. For\nexample, EM2 OIB sources may indeed have a component\nof subducted terrigenous sediments [Eiler et al., 1997]. As\ntrace element patterns of EM2 lava [Weaver, 1991] show no\nsubduction zone dehydration effects (Figure 3b), these\nsediments may not have been introduced into mantle\nthrough \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 subduction zones where dehydration\nreactions are pervasive, and sediments may melt [Elliot et\nal., 1997; Plank and Langmuir, 1998]. Instead, they may\nhave been subducted along with thick basaltic piles, as\nopposed to hydrothermally altered and weathered normal\noceanic crust, at passive continental margins during sub-\nduction initiation [Niu et al., 2001a, 2003], in which case\nsignificant subduction zone dehydration may not take place.\nA few HIMU OIB suites have been shown to have low d18O\n[Eiler et al., 1997], which requires a recycled gabbroic\ncumulate assemblage in their mantle sources if crustal level\nassimilation can be ruled out in OIB petrogenesis [Eiler et\nal., 1996; O\u2019Hara, 1998]. However, the lack of subduction\nzone dehydration signatures (Figure 3b) in HIMU OIB\nrequires that the recycled crust undergo no subduction\ndehydration. It is possible that some HIMU OIB may have\na source component derived from cumulate piles at passive\nmargins as interpreted above for possible sediment sources\nof EM2 OIB. In this case, however, (1) the \u2018\u2018basaltic crust\u2019\u2019\nsubducted is not normal oceanic crust, and (2) this sub-\nducted \u2018\u2018crust\u2019\u2019 must not go down to the lower mantle\notherwise it will not come back to the source regions of\noceanic basalts in the upper mantle (see above). The\nsignificance of sediment and crustal material subduction\nduring subduction initiation at passive margins requires\nfurther evaluation.\n[28] Elevated d18O in olivines of some Hawaii Scientific\nDrilling Project (HSDP) lavas was interpreted to arise from\ncontributions of recycled terrigenous sediments [Eiler et al.,\n1996]. Hauri et al. [1996] and Lassiter and Hauri [1998]\nused Os isotopes to postulate that some of these lavas have a\ncomponent derived from recycled oceanic crust and an\nassociated minor amount of pelagic sediment, whereas other\nlavas may in fact come from recycled oceanic lithosphere.\nHofmann and Jochum [1996] interpreted these Hawaiian\nlavas as resulting from recycled gabbros of the oceanic\nlower crust. Sobolev et al. [2000] further argued that the\ncomposition of olivine melt inclusions in some Hawaiian\nlavas recorded \u2018\u2018ghost\u2019\u2019 plagioclase of ancient recycled\ngabbros. While all these interpretations are interesting, their\nvalidity requires careful testing for the effects of crustal\nassimilation in magma chambers [Eiler et al., 1996;\nO\u2019Hara, 1998]. In particular, melt inclusions are often\nassumed to be melt trapped by liquidus minerals which\nare in equilibrium with that melt. This is often not the case\n[e.g., Gaetani and Watson, 2000]. Also, it is not clear that\nmelt inclusions necessarily record melting processes and\nprimary mantle melt compositions, given that the host\nminerals are crystallizing from the cooling and evolving\nmelts in magma chambers. Except for a few exciting\nfindings by Eiler et al. [1996, 1997], the constancy of\noxygen isotopic compositions in MORB and most OIB\nsuites sets perhaps a maximum limit on the amount of\nrecycled oceanic crust involvement in the OIB genesis.\n4.1. Origin of OIB Sources: Our Perspective\n[29] Following the detailed analysis by Niu et al. [2002a]\nin the context of the petrogenesis of near-ridge seamounts\non the flanks of the East Pacific Rise, we emphasize that\nmantle metasomatism is the most important process that\nproduces geochemically enriched domains as dikes or veins\ndispersed in the predominantly depleted peridotite mantle.\nThe concept of mantle metasomatism has been in the\nliterature for three decades [e.g., Green, 1971; Sun and\nHanson, 1975; Frey and Green, 1974, 1978; Wood, 1979;\nLe Roex et al., 1983; Anderson, 1989, 1994; Sun and\nMcDonough, 1989; McKenzie, 1989; Halliday et al.,\n1995; Niu et al., 1996, 1999], but we illustrate when, where,\nhow and under what conditions this metasomatism takes\nplace, and how this metasomatized mantle material (1)\naffects the geochemistry of OIB and MORB on short\ntimescales and (2) becomes a source feeding hot spot\nvolcanism and OIB in the long term in the context of plate\ntectonics and mantle convection. This model is illustrated in\nFigure 8, which is significantly modified after Niu et al.\n[2002a]. The reasoning that leads to this view is detailed in\nthe following sections.\n4.1.1. A Two-Component Mantle Source\n(Composite Lithologies) for Oceanic Basalts\n[30] Many studies suggest that fertile sources of oceanic\nisland basalts are very heterogeneous on variably small\nscales and also vary with time beneath a given ocean island,\na given seamount and a given ridge segment. A common\nview is that such a heterogeneous source essentially has two\ncomponents, a volumetrically small and easily melted\ncomponent enriched in volatiles, alkalis and other incom-\npatible elements dispersed in ambient depleted and refrac-\ntory peridotitic matrix [Hanson, 1977; Wood, 1979; Le Roex\net al., 1983; Prinzhofer et al., 1989; Hirschmann and\nStolper, 1996; Niu et al., 1996, 1999, 2001b, 2002a; Niu\nand Batiza, 1997; Phipps Morgan and Morgan, 1999]. The\ntwo components themselves can each be compositionally\nheterogeneous [Niu et al., 1999, 2002a].\n4.1.2. Both Components Ancient With\nDifferent Isotopic Histories\n[31] In most cases, clear \u2018\u2018mixing\u2019\u2019 trends are found in\nerupted lavas between an enriched component and a\ndepleted end-member with elevated abundances of incom-\npatible elements associated with radiogenic Sr and unradio-\ngenic Nd isotopes and vice versa. Mixing of this kind in\ngeochemical spaces is in fact the consequence of melting\nECV 5 - 12 NIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS\nsuch a two-component mantle, which may be termed\n\u2018\u2018melting-induced mixing\u2019\u2019 [e.g., Niu et al., 1996, 1999,\n2001b, 2002a]. Melting to variable extents of such a two-\ncomponent mantle or melting to similar extents of a mantle\ncontaining variable proportions of the two components\nresults in similar mixing relationships. Such melting\ninduced mixing implies strong coupling between incompat-\nible trace elements and radiogenic isotopes, which further\nsuggests that both enriched and depleted lithologies must\ndevelop their isotopic characteristic independently over a\nperiod in excess of >1.0 Gyr [e.g., Niu et al., 1999, 2002a].\nThe melting-induced mixing has been quantitatively\ndescribed previously [O\u2019Hara, 1985, 1995] by considering\nthe size and shape of the melting regime, and a power\nfactor, n. Integrated melting regimes described by large\nvalues of n (lots of high-F central melting, little low-F\npartial melt from the periphery) would tend to produce\nrelatively homogeneous liquids representative of the aver-\nage bulk source. Those described by small and variable\nvalues of this power factor (large contributions from low-F\nmelts near the periphery) would show the apparent effects\nof mixing between the lowest solidus temperature compo-\nnent of the mantle (the metasomatic veins) and the more\nabundant but less readily melted component contributed by\npartial melting in the central region. Melt regimes described\nby low values of n will also be more vulnerable to potential\ncomplications arising from the persistence of scarce mineral\nphases which are rich in some of the normally incompatible\ntrace elements [O\u2019Hara et al., 2001].\n4.1.3. Low-F Magmatic Origin of the\nEnriched Component\n[32] In many sample suites with melting-induced mixing\ntrends, the enriched samples are progressively more\nenriched in the more incompatible elements than in the less\nincompatible elements and such enrichment correlates pos-\nitively with radiogenic Sr (proportional to Rb\/Sr) and\nunradiogenic Nd (proportional to Sm\/Nd). This relative\nincompatibility-dependent enrichment indicates that the\nenriched component is of magmatic origin [Niu et al.,\n2002a]. Furthermore, this enrichment correlates positively\nwith ratios of incompatible elements of very similar bulk\ndistribution coefficients such as Nb\/Ta, Zr\/Hf, Rb\/Cs, Nb\/U,\nCe\/Pb. This may indicate that this magmatic process leading\nto formation of the enriched component is low-F melting\nbecause low-F melts host the highest abundances of incom-\npatible elements, and because low-F melting can effectively\nfractionate elements with only subtle differences in incom-\npatibility. Note that complex partial crystallization processes\ncould also cause fractionation of these elements [O\u2019Hara\nand Fry, 1996; O\u2019Hara and Herzberg, 2002], but such\nprocesses will disturb the coupled correlations observed\nwith radiogenic isotope ratios.\n4.1.4. Low-F Melt Metasomatism at the Interface\nBetween the LVZ and the Growing\/Thickening\nOceanic Lithosphere\n[33] Low-F metasomatism is a wide spread phenomenon\nin the earth\u2019s mantle and perhaps throughout much of\nEarth\u2019s history [Green, 1991; Sun and McDonough, 1989]\nas evidenced from mantle xenoliths [e.g., Frey and Green,\n1974, 1978; O\u2019Reilly and Griffin, 1988], massif peridotites\non land [Frey et al., 1985; Takazawa et al., 2000], and\nvolcanics and xenoliths from ocean islands [e.g., Frey,\n1980; Halliday et al., 1995]. Delamination of metasomat-\nized continental lithosphere has also been proposed in the\nliterature as a mechanism to introduce enriched materials in\nthe source regions for oceanic basalts [e.g., McKenzie and\nO\u2019Nions, 1995]. However, as old (>1.0 Ga) subcontinental\nlithosphere is compositionally refractory and physically\nbuoyant, its recycling into the deep mantle is difficult\nalthough possible [Griffin et al., 1999; O\u2019Reilly et al.,\n2001]. Subduction of oceanic lithosphere into deep mantle\nis known to occur, and therefore, metasomatized oceanic\nlithospheric mantle is the better candidate (Figure 8).\n[34] Volumetrically small low-F melts enriched in vola-\ntiles and incompatible elements may develop in the LVZ\nand migrate upward and metasomatize the cooling and\ngrowing lithosphere as fine dikes and veins [e.g., Niu et\nal., 1999, 2002a]. The interface between the LVZ and the\nthickening oceanic lithosphere is the effective solidus of the\nmulticomponent natural system where low-F melt coexists\nwith the thickening lithosphere (Figure 8). The LVZ has the\nlowest seismic velocity and the lowest viscosity in the\nmantle. It is thus the most likely region in the asthenosphere\nwhere fluid phases or small amounts of melt may exist.\nThese fluid phases or low-F melts are enriched in whatever\nvolatiles and incompatible elements present, both immobile\nand mobile incompatible elements. As oceanic lithosphere\nthickens due to cooling with time through basal accretion,\nthese enriched low-F melts are readily frozen and incorpo-\nrated as \u2018\u2018metasomatic\u2019\u2019 dikes or veins in the thickening\nlithosphere at the LVZ-lithosphere interface. Consequently,\nalthough the topmost oceanic lithosphere may be highly\ndepleted (MORB residues represented by abyssal perido-\ntites), by the time of subduction its thickened deeper\nportions are reservoirs of volatiles and incompatible ele-\nments hosted in metasomatized dikes or veins. We envisage\nthat this is where \u2018\u2018two-component\u2019\u2019 mantle develops\nenriched dikes and veins (phlogopite- and amphibole-bear-\ning pyroxenites\/garnet pyroxenites) dispersed in depleted\nperidotitic matrix.\n[35] It is less likely that these deep (>60 km) portions of\nthe lithosphere would undergo significant dehydration in\nsubduction zones because of the thermal structure of the\nsubducting slab. Reinjection of this lithosphere into the\ndeep mantle with a subduction-processed oceanic crust on\nthe top, with MORB melting residues (serpentinized harz-\nburgites) in the middle and with a metasomatized peridotite\nsection at the base will contribute to small-scale and large-\namplitude compositional heterogeneities in the Earth\u2019s man-\ntle [Niu et al., 1999, 2002a].\n4.1.5. Recycling of the Metasomatized Oceanic\nLithosphere as Sources Feeding Hot Spot Volcanisms\nand OIB\n[36] In this discussion, we assume that subducting oceanic\nlithosphere can penetrate the 660-D into the lower mantle\nand probably can approach the core-mantle boundary [e.g.,\nGrand et al., 1997], where this subducted lithosphere will be\nheated with time. The heating raises its bulk buoyancy. Its\ncrust and mantle components separate during ascent by\nbuoyancy contrast. The crust tends to sink (Figure 6), but\nthe thermally buoyant peridotitic mantle rises. The presence\nof volatiles and alkalis in the metasomatized lithosphere may\nfacilitate partial or localized total melting, which (1) en-\nhances the buoyancy because peridotite melt is least\nNIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS ECV 5 - 13\ndense among all likely materials at all these depths (Figure 7)\nand (2) reduces the bulk viscosity, physically easing the\nascent. The top portion of the subducted lithosphere (i.e.,\n\u2018\u2018serpentinized MORB residues\u2019\u2019) may still hold significant\namounts of water inherited from incomplete dehydration of\nserpentine [Kuroda and Irifune, 1998], which may further\nfacilitate melting. Given the elevated viscosity in the ambi-\nent lower mantle and the expectation that any bulk material\nsufficiently fertile to account for the local volume of OIB\neruptives will also be significantly denser than the ambient\nupper mantle, we believe the presence of melt is important\nfor both the initiation and ascent of the mantle plumes\n[O\u2019Hara, 1975]. This differs from the traditional view that\nplumes are primarily hot and dry during their initiation and\nascent [e.g., Griffiths and Campbell, 1990; Davies and\nRichards, 1992].\n[37] We believe the principal constituent of what ascends\nin \u2018\u2018mantle plumes\u2019\u2019 is peridotitic in composition. This\ncontrasts with the popular view of \u2018\u2018mantle plumes from\nancient oceanic crust\u2019\u2019 [Hofmann and White, 1982; Chris-\ntensen and Hofmann, 1994], which implies that the source\nis basaltic, and would be eclogitic in most of the upper\nmantle and probably far too dense to ascend. Mantle plumes\nof predominantly peridotitic composition with the presence\nof peridotitic melt are physically buoyant (Figure 7) and\nwill rise. Chemically, the peridotitic composition of plumes\nexplains the high-magnesian composition of primitive OIB.\nIn contrast, plumes of basaltic composition meet neither the\nphysical nor the chemical requirements.\n4.1.6. Two Timescales of\n\u2018\u2018Mantle Source Enrichments\u2019\u2019\n[38] The geophysical observation that oceanic lithosphere\nreaches full thickness in the time frame of \u000170\u201380 Ma\nsuggests that in a vertical section of a mature oceanic\nlithosphere, the age differences of the metasomatic dikes\nor veins can be as large as \u000180 Myr. This time span is in\nfact quite short on geological timescale and in terms of\nradiogenic isotope evolution. Intraplate hot spot volcanism,\nwhile having most of its melts derived from asthenospheric\nmantle, will assimilate with, remobilize or even melt the\nrecently metasomatized lithosphere [O\u2019Hara, 1998; Niu et\nal., 1999, 2002a], leading to extremely enriched lavas such\nas alkali basalts, nephelinite, basanite on many ocean\nislands and some intraplate seamounts [Batiza and Vanko,\n1984; Zindler et al., 1984]. In this case, incompatible trace\nelements and radiogenic isotopes are often decoupled\nbecause of significant P\/D fractionation by the recent\nmetasomatism, yet without having enough time to produce\nradiogenic isotopes [e.g., Halliday et al., 1995]. Some of\nthese metasomatized or metasomatizing deep portions of the\nlithosphere may be perturbed by ridgeward asthenospheric\nflow, leading to MORB melts with clear trace element-\nisotope decoupling [Mahoney et al., 1994; Halliday et al.,\n1995; Niu et al., 1996].\n[39] Many OIB suites, including some Hawaiian lava\nsuites [Hauri, 1996; Lassiter and Hauri, 1998], seamount\nlavas, and MORB show excellent coupling between incom-\npatible trace elements and radiogenic isotopes and even\nmajor elements [Castillo et al., 1998; Niu et al., 1999,\n2002a; Regelous et al., 1999; Wendt et al., 1999]. Such\ncoupling requires a time interval between formation of\nmetasomatized mantle and the volcanism in excess of 1.0\nGyr, which may represent a minimum period from the time\nof the subduction of metasomatized oceanic lithosphere into\ndeep mantle to the return of these materials feeding hot spot\nvolcanism and OIB in the upper mantle.\n4.2. Implications for the Chemical Structure\nof the Earth\u2019s Mantle\n[40] As discussed above and illustrated in Figures 6 and\n7, oceanic crust subducted into the lower mantle will not\nreturn in bulk to the upper mantle because of the negative\nbuoyancy in both solid and liquid states. Transfer of\nbasaltic crust to the lower mantle would be an irreversible\nFigure 8. (opposite) Schematic representations of our preferred interpretation for the origin of enriched geochemical\ncharacteristics of OIB in the context of plate tectonics and mantle convection. (a) A general sketch of the origin of oceanic\nlithosphere at an ocean ridge, its thickening\/growth due to heat loss with time, and its ultimate return into the deep mantle.\n(b) A snapshot of the growing lithosphere. The oceanic lithosphere thickens with time through basal accretion due solely to\nheat loss to the surface. As the material to be accreted to the growing lithosphere with time comes from the LVZ, the\ninterface between the lithosphere and the LVZ as a natural solidus representing the freezing front through which low-F\nmelts enriched in volatiles and incompatible elements originating in the LVZ is incorporated into the thickening lithosphere\nin the forms of trapped metasomatic melts or fine dikes or veins. The points labeled P1\u2013P7 indicate the low-F melts\nincorporated into the thickening lithosphere at different times and at different depths. While enriched materials incorporated\nat P1 would be the oldest, metasomatism or melt freezing can take place from P1 through P7 all at the same time. Therefore\nthe ages of the enriched heterogeneities in the lithosphere on a vertical section cannot be resolved in the time frame (\u000170\u2013\n80 Ma) before the lithosphere reaches its full thickness. These enriched heterogeneities would be similarly old when the\nrecycled lithosphere returns to the source regions of oceanic basalts after >1 Ga. (c) A stratigraphic sketch of the residual\noceanic lithosphere after passing through subduction zone dehydration reactions: (1) The residual crust is depleted in water-\nsoluble incompatible elements (see inset spidergram), and is thus unsuitable as sources for mantle plumes and OIB; (2) the\nMORB melting residues atop the lithospheric mantle may still retain significant amount of water stored in dense hydrous\nphases [Kuroda and Irifune, 1998] inherited from serpentines [Ulmer and Trommsdorff, 1995] thus should also retain\ngeochemical signatures of both MORB melting residues and serpentinization; (3) the deep portions of the lithosphere\ncontains abundant metasomatized dikes or veins enriched in volatiles and incompatible elements (see inset spidergram).\nThese metasomatized dikes\/veins could be remobilized upward or assimilated\/melted during intraplate eruptions, giving\nrise to some extremely enriched lavas on many ocean islands. On the other hand, when subducted into lower mantle, the\nmetasomatized deep portions of the lithosphere will become sources of mantle plumes feeding hot spot volcanisms and\nOIB.

This supports the argument for a hidden compo-\nnent deep in the lower mantle that has not been sampled\nby known volcanism [McDonough, 1991; Blichert-Toft\nand Albare`de, 1997; Rudnick et al., 2000; Albare`de and\nvan der Hilst, 2002] and would also lead to chemical\nstratification of the mantle with the mean composition of\nthe lower mantle becoming progressively enriched in\nresidual ocean crust lithologies (i.e., compositionally lower\nin Ca\/Al, and higher in Fe\/Mg, Si\/Mg, Al, and water-\ninsoluble incompatible elements such as Ti, Nb, Ta, Zr,\nand Hf). If subduction of oceanic crusts into the lower\nmantle has continued for some time, then a large composi-\ntional contrast in terms of these elements must exists\nbetween the upper and lower mantle. The magnitude of\nsuch compositional contrast depends on many factors to be\nexplored. One of the most obvious factors is when the\nsubducting oceanic lithosphere began to penetrate the 660-\nD. This question is relevant because the Earth was likely\nNIU AND O\u2019HARA: ORIGIN OF OCEAN ISLAND BASALTS ECV 5 - 15\nto be hotter in its early history and the oceanic lithosphere\nthen would be thinner, reach thermal equilibrium more\nrapidly with the ambient mantle and thus may have lost its\nnegative thermal buoyancy before reaching 660-D.\nAnother important question is whether oceanic crusts can\nindeed descend into the lower mantle through 660-D along\nwith the subducting lithospheric mantle. It is not improb-\nable that the subducting crust may be stripped, at least\npartly, off the slab and remain in the transition zone\n[Ringwood and Irifune, 1988] given the lower density of\nthe oceanic crust than the peridotite mantle around 660 km\n(Figure 6) [Irifune and Ringwood, 1993; Hirose et al.,\n1999].\n5. Summary\n[41] 1. There is no obvious association between ancient\nrecycled oceanic crusts and OIB sources (mantle plumes) in\nterms of petrology, geochemistry, and mineral physics.\n[42] 2. Melting of oceanic crusts with basaltic\/picritic\ncompositions cannot produce high-magnesian lavas parental\nto most OIB. Primitive OIB melts (>15% MgO) are likely\nmore magnesian than bulk ocean crust (<13% MgO).\n[43] 3. Oceanic crusts passing through subduction zone\ndehydration reactions should be depleted in water-soluble\nincompatible elements such as Ba, Rb, Cs, Th, U, K, Sr, Pb\nrelative to water-insoluble incompatible elements such as\nNb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti, etc. Residual crusts with such trace\nelement systematics are unsuitable as fertile sources for\nOIB.\n[44] 4. Ancient oceanic crusts are isotopically too\ndepleted to produce the isotopic signatures of most OIB.\nOIB Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes preserve no signature that indicates\nprevious subduction zone dehydration histories.\n[45] 5. Subducted oceanic crusts at shallow lower mantle\nconditions form mineral assemblages that are much (>2.3%)\ndenser than the ambient peridotitic mantle. If the subducted\ncrusts melt in the deep lower mantle, this melt, depending\nupon its composition, may have still greater (up to 15%)\ndensity than solid peridotitic mantle. Therefore ancient\noceanic crusts that have subducted into the deep lower\nmantle will not return in bulk to the upper mantle in either\nthe solid or molten states.\n[46] 6. Small fragmented components of subducted oce-\nanic crusts could be returned to the upper mantle source\nregions of oceanic basalts provided they were carried along\nwith streams of ascending buoyant material, but there is no\nconvincing evidence for the presence of bulk subducted\ncrust in the source regions of oceanic basalts, noting points\n3 and 4 above.\n[47] 7. Models invoking recycled oceanic crust to explain\nthe geochemistry of OIB must be able to demonstrate how\nsuch crust can, by melting, produce high-magnesian lavas in\nmany OIB suites and must also explain the lack of sub-\nduction zone dehydration signatures in OIB. Models that\nrequire ancient subducted crusts as plume sources reacti-\nvated from the lower mantle also require physical mecha-\nnisms to overcome the huge negative buoyancy of those\nsubducted crusts in both lower and upper mantle.\n[48] 8. Recycled deep portions of oceanic peridotitic\nlithosphere are the best candidates for the sources feeding\nhot spot volcanism and OIB. These deep portions of oceanic\nlithosphere are likely to have been enriched in water-soluble\nincompatible elements like Ba, Rb, Cs, Th, U, K, Sr, Pb as\nwell as all other incompatible elements as a result of low-F\nmelt metasomatism at the interface between the LVZ and\nthe cooling and thickening oceanic lithosphere. These\nmetasomatized lithospheric materials are peridotitic in bulk\ncomposition. They can, by partial or locally total melting,\nproduce high-magnesian melts for primitive OIB. Such\nmaterials may develop positive thermal buoyancy upon\nheating in the deep mantle, especially in the presence of a\nperidotitic melt phase, making it possible for the bulk\nmaterial to ascend as plumes.\n[49] 9. The solidus temperatures of both dry peridotites\nand MORB (proxy for recycled oceanic crust) are too high\nfor melting to occur commonly at uppermost lower mantle\nconditions. However, if such melts are formed, the best\ncandidates for a source rock would be recycled deep\nportions of oceanic lithosphere with abundant volatiles\nand alkalis (see point 8), which will lower the solidus\ntemperature significantly. Recycled incompletely dehy-\ndrated serpentinized MORB residues atop the lithospheric\nmantle (\u2018\u2018abyssal peridotites\u2019\u2019) with abundant water will\nalso be a favored source material for melt generation.\n[50] 10. If oceanic crusts subducted into the lower mantle\ncannot return to the upper mantle because of their negative\nbuoyancy in both the solid and liquid states, then a\n\u2018\u2018hidden\u2019\u2019 component must exist in the deep mantle that\nhas not been sampled by known volcanism. As a result, a\ncompositional contrast between the upper and lower mantle\nmust have developed. The bulk lower mantle would have\nbecome progressively higher in Si\/Mg, Fe\/Mg etc. than the\nupper mantle. Given the geodynamic significance of the\ninference, further quantitative evaluation is needed.\n[51] Acknowledgments. Both authors thank Cardiff University for\nsupport.
