The\ncomplex interplay between crustal and sea-level movements continues to in\ufb02uence the morphological\ndevelopment of the Scottish coast. A number of geophysical models predict ongoing uplift of the Scottish\nlandmass. However, a number of recent studies based upon the analysis of satellite altimetry data\nindicate a late 20th Century acceleration in the rate of eustatic sea-level rise.\nDetailed geochemistry, radiometric dating, and diatom analysis on selected sediment cores from four\nmature coastalmarsh environments in Argyll, western Scotland, provides an opportunity to investigate the\nlinkages between Twentieth century crustal movements, eustatic sea-level rise and recent rates of sedi-\nmentation recorded within marsh sediments across the proposed Scottish glacio-isostatic uplift dome.\nSolid-phase major and trace element geochemistry has been used to examine the extent to which\npost-depositional physical disturbance and\/or chemical reactions may have in\ufb02uenced the reliability of\nthe radiometric dating methods. Geochemical data indicate that the evolution of these marsh environ-\nments has not been signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uenced by physical disturbance and overall the supply of minero-\ngenic material to the marshes has been quite uniform.\nVertical distributions of 210Pbexcess and 137Cs activity have been measured and used to develop models\nof recent marsh vertical accretion. Dating of the cores reveals subtle variations in the rates of sediment\naccumulation over the last c. 70 years between sites. For much of the last hundred years or so, sedi-\nmentation rates have been in good overall agreement with various estimations for sea-level rise,\nalthough at the more easterly sites these estimates are generally exceeded. However, quasi-equilibrium\nbetween marsh sedimentation and sea-level rise for much of the Twentieth Century is indicated from the\nDiatom analysis.\nOver the most recent period of marsh development (<10 years), a signi\ufb01cant increase in the rate of\nsurface sedimentation is recorded at all sites across the study area. Diatom analysis of these surface\nlayers reveals an increase in the relative abundance of marine (polyhalobous) taxa in the near-surface\nsediments. This signi\ufb01es a very recent increase in the rate of regional relative sea-level rise indicating\nthat a regional threshold in coastal forcing has now been exceeded.\nThese \ufb01ndings provide clear evidence that recent relative sea-level rise is now outpacing estimated\nrates of glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) across the proposed Scottish uplift dome.\n\u0001 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.98\n99\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n1051. Introduction\nIt is widely believed that at a global scale, sea-level rise has\naccelerated since the mid 20th Century, with present global rates\nestimated to be 3.1 mm yr\u00011 (Cabanes et al., 2001; Holgate andfax: \u00fe44 (0)1273 642285.\nTeasdale).\nElsevier Ltd.\n.A., et al., Recent estuarine sed\n016\/j.quascirev.2010.08.002\n106\n107\n108Woodworth, 2004; Leuliette et al., 2004; Church and White,\n2006; Woodworth et al., 2009). At a regional scale, the character\nof sea-level change is much more variable and any appreciation of\nthe probable nature of future changes requires detailed consider-\nation of more local factors such as tectonic and glacio-isostatic\nmovements (Firth and Stewart, 2000).\nGeophysically-based models are increasingly being used to help\nunderstand present day Earth movements and sea-level changeimentation rates from shallow inter-tidal environments inwestern...,\n109\n110\nP.A.

A good\nexample of this is the distinct discrepancies between modeled and\nempirically-based sea-level curves for the Beauly Firth, north-east\nScotland. At present themodels incorporate assumptions concerning\nthe former thickness of ice cover and a further issue arises over\nwhether the spatial patterns of crustal movement have remained\nstatic over time or have migrated (Firth and Stewart, 2000).\nGeophysical models suggest that glacio-isostatic adjustment\n(GIA) processes are still active and that crustal uplift of the Scottish\nmainland is still taking place with maximum rates of <2.0 mmyr\u00011\nat the centre of uplift in the Western Highlands (Firth and Stewart,\n2000; Shennan and Horton, 2002; Gehrels, in press). Recent\nre\ufb01nements to some models are now producing improved esti-\nmations of present day crustal movements for the British Isles\n(Bradley et al., 2009; Shennan et al., 2009).\nDuring the Late Holocene relative sea-level movements have\nbeen complex. Sea-level has generally fallen at sites in close prox-\nimity to the centre of uplift and risen at the margins (Dawson and\nSmith, 1997; Dawson et al., 2001; Da la Vega-Leinert et al., 2007;\nJordan et al., 2009). Detail concerning rates of recent relative sea-\nlevel change for northern Britain is limited to the analysis of rather\nsparse tide-gauge data for the Scottish coast. The long record from\nAberdeen (109 years) provides a useful estimation for 20th century\nsea-level rise of 1.0 \u0003 0.15 mm yr\u00011 (Shennan and Woodworth,\n1992), albeit from a location peripheral to the former centre of\nuplift in North-East Scotland.\nRecent statistical analysis presented by Pethick (1999) suggests\nthat the trend of falling relative sea-level is likely to be reversed in\nresponse to predicted rates of global sea-level rise which are likely\nto accelerate during the \ufb01rst half of the 21st century (Douglas,1992:\nCabanes et al., 2001; Cazenave and Nerem, 2004; Holgate and\nWoodworth, 2004; Leuliette et al., 2004; Nakada and Inoue,\n2005; Nerem et al., 2006 Cazenave et al., 2008).\nUsing tide-gauge data from stations other than that at Aberdeen\nwith shorter temporal records, Dawson et al. (2001) provide esti-\nmations of present relative sea-level change and best estimates for\nfuture rates of change to 2050 AD for northern Britain, within zones\nde\ufb01ned by differential rates of residual GIA across the uplift dome.\nThey suggest present day continuing relative sea-level fall within\ncoastal locationsproximal to areas experiencingmaximumestimated\nrates of uplift (Shennan andHorton, 2002; Shennan et al., 2009) with\na reversalof relative sea-levelmovementby2050ADtoratesof rsl rise\nof<2.9 mmyr\u00011. While tide-gauges, andmore recently GPS stations,\nprovide some of the most detailed information on relative sea-level\nchange for northern Britain, they are typically sparse and of limited\nduration, making assessment of likely future changes problematic.\nAn alternative proxy for understanding recent relative change in\nsea-level can be provided by empirical studies of contemporary\ncoastal marsh sediments. These can be extremely sensitive to\nchanges in mean sea-level (Reed, 1995) and a number of studies\nhave highlighted the close correlation between rates of sedimen-\ntation taking place onmaturemarsh surfaces and estimated rates of\nregional sea-level rise (Pethick, 1981: Gehrels and Leatherman,\n1989; Allen, 1990a, 1990b; French, 1993; Cundy and Croudace,\n1996; Orson et al., 1998; Temmerman et al., 2003).Please cite this article in press as: Teasdale, P.A., et al., Recent estuarine sed\nQuaternary Science Reviews (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.quascirev.2010.08.002From a sea-level research perspective, studies of contemporary\ncoastal wetland development in northwest Scotland are lacking\nwithin the published literature. This paper aims to redress this\nsituation by focussing upon the investigation of recent\/historical\nrates of sedimentation from inter-tidal marsh settings in Argyll,\nwestern Scotland. In so doing, this provides an opportunity to\ninvestigate the linkages between estimated continued crustal\nmovements, recent sea-level change and the rates of vertical marsh\nsedimentation recorded within shallow marsh sequences across\nthe proposed glacio-isostatic uplift dome.\n2. Study area\nThe coastline of the Western Scottish Highlands displays\na number of well-studied raised\/relict shoreline features present at\ndiffering altitudes that re\ufb02ect the interaction of eustatic sea-level\nchanges and glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) processes (Synge\nand Stephens, 1966; Gray, 1974; Dawson, 1980b; Sissons, 1982,\n1983; Gray, 1985; Smith, 1997). The large body of earlier research\nhas recently been updated by Smith et al. (in preparation) who\nidentify a number of distinct shorelines of Holocene age which\nshow a broadly consistent pattern of land uplift in Northern Britain.\nA number of bio-stratigraphic studies have also been under-\ntaken from various locations in western Scotland, from which\ndetailed relative sea-level curves for the region have been deve-\nloped (Shennan et al., 1993, 1994, 1995a; Dawson et al., 1998; Selby\net al., 2000; Shennan et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2007). The region is\nalso of interest from a neotectonic perspective. Analysis of raised\nshorelines around the Firth of Lorne suggests localized block uplift\nof the crust (Gray, 1974; Ringrose, 1989) with altitudinal offsets\ncoinciding with major fault lines (Firth and Stewart, 2000).\nFour marsh sites in western Argyll were examined extending\nwestwards away from the centre of uplift over a w70 km transect\nacross the Firth of Lorne (Fig. 1).\nThe most easterly site is located near the proposed centre of\nuplift at the head of Loch Etive, with the more westerly sites being\nprogressively located towards the margin of the uplift dome on the\nwest coast of the Isle of Mull (Fig. 1). According to the geophysical\nmodels (Lambeck, 1991, 1993a, 1993b, 1995; Shennan and Horton,\n2002) all four sites should still be experiencing GIA with rates of\nuplift increasing towards the east.\nThree of the study sites (Loch Scridain, Loch Creran & Loch Etive)\nrepresent estuarine sea-loch environments where marsh sediments\nhave accumulated within the inter-tidal areas at the head of these\nformer glacially scoured fjords. The remaining site at Loch Don,\nsituated on the south-east side of the Isle of Mull, is surrounded by\nlessmountainous topography and represents an extremely protected\ndepositional setting unlikely to be in\ufb02uenced by higher energy wave\nconditions, thereby providing a useful setting for comparison of\nmarsh development within the fjord-head settings.\nTidal ranges within the study region are macro-tidal, exceeding\n4 m around the coastline of the Isle of Mull and within the Firth of\nLorne. However, within Loch Etive the internal tidal range is much\nreduced and does not exceed 1.8 m as a consequence of severe\nshoaling over the inner basin bedrock sill of the fjord, which\nconstrains tidal currents (Edwards and Edelstone, 1977). The\ngeomorphology of the four marsh sites and extent of marsh\ndevelopment along with the location of core sampling sites are\nshown in Fig. 2.\n3.

Such studies highlight the\nability of many mature (high) marsh settings (i.e. marsh surfaces\nthat are only \ufb02ooded during the Highest Water Ordinary Spring\nTides, HWOST), to \u2018keep pace\u2019 with sea-level rise via an asymptotic\nrelationship between vertical sediment accumulation and rates of\nsea-level rise (i.e. the marsh maintains its elevation relative to the\ntidal frame).\nSediment accretion and surface elevation change are highly\ndependent upon a number of key in\ufb02uential factors. These include,\nlocal crustal movements, supply of minerogenic sediment to the\nmarsh surface, in situ production of organic matter, the composi-\ntion and density of halophytic plant species and importantly, tidal\nrange which determines the available accommodation space for\nsediment accumulation to take place.\nUnderstanding of the linkages between these processes and the\nmorphodynamic behaviour of coastal wetlands has been improvedPlease cite this article in press as: Teasdale, P.A., et al., Recent estuarine sed\nQuaternary Science Reviews (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.quascirev.2010.08.002by the development of several conceptual, one-dimensionalmodels\n(Krone, 1987; Allen, 1990a, 1990b; French, 1993; Allen, 1995, 1997,\n2003, Kirwan and Temmerman, 2009), which consider the para-\nmeters that in\ufb02uence vertical marsh sedimentation through time.\nThese have been tested in modern marsh settings by a number of\nstudies with emphasis focussed upon quantifying the morphody-\nnamic response to sea-level rise through vertical sediment accu-\nmulation (Armentano and Woodwell, 1975; McCaffrey and\nThompson, 1980; Reed, 1990; Cahoon and Reed, 1995: Cundy and\nCroudace, 1996; French, 1996; Orson et al., 1998; Cundy et al.,\n2002; Temmerman et al., 2003; French, 2006).

Recently, unlike the more straightforward classi\ufb01-\ncation of taxa into freshwater, brackish or marine tolerant forms,\na range of high resolution ecologically derived transfer functions\nhave been developed that relate speci\ufb01c modern microfossil\nassemblage data to measured environmental gradients (e.g.\nsalinity and altitude) across contemporary marsh surfaces (Zong\nand Horton, 1998; Edwards and Horton, 2000; Gehrels, 2000;\nGehrels et al., 2001; Edwards et al., 2004; Massey et al.,\n2006a,b; Szkornik et al., 2006).\nRecent studies using foraminifera analysis, from thewestern and\neastern North Atlantic Ocean coastal margins, have presented\nevidence for regional relative sea-level rise during historic times.\nA rate of 3.2 mm yr\u00011 is recorded in marsh sediments from Chez-\nzetcook Inlet, Nova Scotia, Canada (Gehrels et al., 2005) providing\nevidence of an early 20th Century acceleration.

Linkages between recent marsh\nsedimentation and sea-level rise have been investigated using this\napproach by Haslett et al. (2001), in the Severn Estuary, UK. Here,\nmarsh vertical sedimentation was examined by assessing changes\nin the relative abundance assemblage of key Foraminifera. This\nstudy used the indicative meaning (i.e. the relationship of a sea-\nlevel index point to a contemporaneous tide level; Shennan,\n1983a,b), determined from microfossil assemblages to reveal\nwhether or not rates of sediment accretion maintained a quasi-\nequilibrium with sea-level tendency or were indicative of submer-\ngence or emergent periods of marsh development. This technique\nprovided a robust assessment of the reliability of marsh vertical\nsedimentation as a proxy for sea-level rise (Haslett et al., 2001).\nHere, we have adopted this approach using diatom assemblage data\nfor comparison with 210Pb and 137Cs derived geochronologies.\n4.

Sediment monoliths of\n75 cm diameter were extracted by manual digging and supported\nusing PVC drainage pipe to ensure that no compaction of the core\nsamples occurred. All cores were described in the \ufb01eld and were\nthen sealed and secured to prevent damage during transport.\nUnder laboratory conditions, a detailed description of the stratig-\nraphy was compiled and the cores were then sliced and sub-\nsampled at 1 and 2 cm intervals prior to analysis.\n4.2. Radiometric dating using 210Pb and 137Cs\nMeasurement of 210Pb activity (half-life (t\u00bd) \u00bc 22.26 years) is\na widely established method for the dating of recent coastal sedi-\nment sequences (Koide et al., 1972; Armentano and Woodwell,\n1975; Robbins, 1978; Wise, 1980; French, 1996: Thompson et al.,\n2002; Cundy et al., 2002; Haslett et al., 2003). 210Pb is a naturally\noccurring radionuclide formed as part of the 238U decay series. The\nmethod is based upon the measurement of 210Pb \u2018excess\u2019 activity\nincorporated into the accumulating sediment from atmospheric\nfallout. Total measured 210Pbwithin sediment sequences is the sum\nof this excess activity and the supported activity (resulting from the\ndecay of 238U series radionuclides producing a 226Ra component\nthrough in situ decay). A full description of the methodology is\ngiven in Appleby and Old\ufb01eld (1992) and Appleby (2001).\n137Cs is an arti\ufb01cial radionuclide (half-life (t\u00bd)\u00bc 30.2 years) and\nis present in environmental systems as a result of atmospheric\ninputs and marine discharges. Signi\ufb01cant global atmospheric\ninputs occurred through the detonation of high-yield thermonu-\nclear weapons, commencing in 1952. The mean atmospheric resi-\ndence time is estimated to have been 6e13 months (Appleby et al.,\n1991) with radionuclides being returned to the ground by wet and\ndry depositional processes. The most signi\ufb01cant fallout maxima in\nthe northern hemisphere occurred in 1963 (Ritchie and McHenry,\n1990). Further atmospherically derived 137Cs to the environment,\nin particular to northern Europe, occurred as a result of the Cher-\nnobyl nuclear power reactor accident on the 26th of April 1986. This\nreleased a considerable quantity of radioactive material into the\natmosphere but unlike the radioactivity resulting from the earlier\nweapons-testing programs did not penetrate the stratosphere. As\na consequence much of the radioactivity derived from this source\nwas returned to the Earth\u2019s surface via wet deposition in the days\nfollowing the accident. This resulted in the deposition of 137Cs and\nother radioisotopes throughout many European countries\n(Anspaugh et al., 1988) including the UK (Cambray et al., 1987;\nPlayford et al., 1992; Callaway et al., 1996b).\nIn recent decades, a signi\ufb01cant source of radio-caesium to the\nwestern Scottish coast has been derived from authorized\ndischarges into the Irish Sea from the British Nuclear Fuels Limited\n(BNFL) nuclear power generation facility at Sella\ufb01eld (see Fig. 1)\nlocated in Cumbria, NW England (Fig. 3).\nAmarine transport lag time of approximately 1 year for Sella\ufb01eld\nderived radionuclides entering the western Scottish coastal region\nhas been suggested from the studies by McKinley et al. (1981),\nLivingstone et al. (1982a; 1982b) and McKay and Baxter (1985).\nWhere detected within sediment sequences, distinct peaks in\n137Cs activity provide useful marker horizons linked to known\nperiods of atmospheric inputs and marine discharges from nuclear\nfacilities.\nThese marker horizons also provide an independent time-strati-\ngraphic horizon tracer with which to critically evaluate 210Pbexcess-\nderived estimations of marsh sediment accumulation (Aston and\nStanners, 1979; Callaway et al., 1996b; Norton-Smith, 2001).\n210Pb activity was determined through the measurement of its\ngranddaughter radionuclide 210Po (proxy method in secular equi-\nlibriumwith 210Pb), using alpha spectrometry. The method is basedPlease cite this article in press as: Teasdale, P.A., et al., Recent estuarine sed\nQuaternary Science Reviews (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.quascirev.2010.08.002upon the technique outlined in Flynn (1968), which uses double-\nacid leaching of the sediment sample followed by auto-deposition\nof the Po in the leachate onto silver polished disks. 209Po was added\nto the sample and used as an isotopic yield tracer. The limit of\ndetection is 0.1 Bq kg\u00011. The supported 210Pb activity was deter-\nmined from the value of constant 210Po activity at depth and\ncorroborated using measurement of 214Bi and 214Pb obtained from\ngamma spectrometry. Samples were counted over a three-day\nperiod on a Canberra Alpha spectrometry Quad system at the\nNational Oceanography Centre, Southampton, UK. Measurement of\nthe cores from Argyll shows the supported 210Pb activity to be\nbetween 12 and 20 Bq kg\u00011 (\u00032 Bq kg\u00011).\n137Cs activity pro\ufb01les were determined by gamma spectrometry\nusing a Canberra 30% P-Type High Purity Germanium well-type\ndetector system. Count times of 80 000 s were used for upper core\nsamples with count times of up to 320 000 s being undertaken for\nsamples at depth. Counting errors were typically less than 5% with\ndetection limits of 0.5 Bq kg\u00011. All gamma data were processed\nusing the Fitzpeaks software package (J.F. Computing Services,\nStanford in the Vale, UK) and measured 137Cs activity levels have\nbeen decay corrected to the time of sampling for individual cores.\n4.3. Sediment geochemistry\nThe reliable use of radionuclides for modelling sediment accu-\nmulation is highly dependent upon their post-depositional\nimmobility. Remobilization of radionuclides can occur as a result of\nphysical reworking, bioturbation and chemical diagenesis in \ufb02uc-\ntuating redox environments (Cundy and Croudace, 1995). Both\n210Pb and 137Cs distributions can be vulnerable to such processes\nparticularly in strongly reducing environments (Evans et al., 1983;\nComans et al., 1989; Benoit and Hemond, 1990; Urban et al., 1990;\nHardaway et al., 1998). Hence, it is important to assess whether\nsuch processes may have in\ufb02uenced the down-core distribution of\nradionuclides used for dating purposes.\nMajor and trace element geochemistry analysis provides\nameans of achieving such an assessment and is a robust method for\ndetermining the solid-phase distribution of redox-sensitive\nelements thereby facilitating direct comparison with radionuclide\nactivity pro\ufb01les.\nSediment compositional data was obtained using X-ray \ufb02uo-\nrescence spectrometry. Major elements were determined from\nfused beads with trace elements being measured from the analysis\nof pressed powder pellets. The procedure follows the method\noutlined in Croudace and Williams-Thorpe (1988) and Croudace\nand Gilligan (1990). Measurement precision was assessed by\nroutinely comparing concentration values from a range of standard\nreference materials (typically USGS and MAG-1 marine shale).\nPrecision was typically <3% relative standard deviation for major\nelements and <5% for trace elements.

Diatom analysis\nPreparation of diatom slides follows the method outlined in\nBattarbee (1986). A sub-sample of approximately 0.2e0.5 g of wet\nsediment sample from speci\ufb01c depth horizons was taken and\ndigested in 40 ml of 30% Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) to remove\norganic material. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant\ndiscarded. Pellets were then re-suspended and washed using\ndistilled water and re-centrifuged. The washing process was per-\nformed up to four times to ensure thorough cleaning of material for\nslide preparation. 3e5 ml of the \ufb01nal clear homogenized aliquot\n(w50 ml) was carefully pippeted onto a cover slip. Once dry these\nwere thenmounted ontomicroscope slides using Naphrax solution.\nAnalysis of prepared slides was performed using a Meiji M800\nseries light microscope with up to 1500\u0004 magni\ufb01cation capability\nwith phase contrast coupled with a live image capture software\nsystem for \u2018on-screen\u2019 imaging of slides. The down-core relative\nabundance of taxa based upon known salinity preferences were\nrecorded and the raw data were complied into representative\ngraphical format using the Tilia Graph software (Grimm, 1991).\nDiatom identi\ufb01cation was undertaken using a range of reference\ntexts and published articles (Krammer and Horst-Lange Betalot,\n1986; Hartley, 1986; Krammer and Horst-Lange Betalot, 1988,\n1991a,b; Vos and de Wolf, 1993a; Hartley et al., 1996; Vos and de\nWolf, 1998; Witkowski et al., 2000).\n5. Results and interpretation\n5.1. Stratigraphy and core composition of the Argyll marshes\nThe stratigraphy of the four cores is shown in Fig. 4. In the core\nfrom Loch Scridain sedimentary material consists of an upper unit\nof dark-brown \u2018silty\u2019 peat with abundant rootlets, with some \ufb01ne to\nmedium sand present throughout extending from the surface of the\nmarsh situated at 1.71mOD down to a depth of 57 cm. This overlies\na lower basal unit of coarse sands with medium to \ufb01ne gravel and\nsome cobble-sized material that extends to the base of the core at\n68 cm depth (at 1.03mOD). At discrete depths within the peat layer\noccasional small quite angular clasts of \ufb01ne gravel are visible. The\nlower 18 cm section of the peat consists of a more clay-richmaterial\nwhich was noticeably less water-logged and compact (Fig. 4). At\nLoch Don the marsh core consists of an upper unit of brown\/light-\nbrown silty clay containing lenses of \ufb01ne sand extending from the\nsurface at 1.89 m OD down to 11 cm depth. Abundant rootlets are\nvisible in this upper section. These are still present in the under-\nlying sub-unit in which the \ufb01ne sand content increases down to\na depth of 27 cm at 1.62 m OD. A further underlying sub-unit of\nmore clay-rich material with sandy lenses extends from 27 cm to\na depth of 35 cm (1.54mOD). This unit is darker and grades to dark-\nbrown\/dark grey at the boundary with the basal coarse sand and\ngravel where some angular clasts of pebble-sized material is also\nevident at a depth of 50 cm situated at 1.39 m OD (Fig. 4). The core\nfrom Loch Creran contains an upper unit of dark-brown\/black silty\npeat with some clay extending down from the surface at 1.87 m OD\nto a depth of 36e37 cm (1.50 m OD). Rootlets are quite abundant\nwithin this upper unit and some small angular pebble-sized clasts\nare visible at 14e15 cm. Beneath this unit the lithology grades over\n2e3 cm into an underlying unit of coarse sand and \ufb01ne gravel\nmaterial extending from 37 cm to a depth of 55 cm situated at\n1.37mOD. Rootlets are virtually absent from this section of the core\nwhich overlies a basal unit of gravel-rich material consisting ofPlease cite this article in press as: Teasdale, P.A., et al., Recent estuarine sed\nQuaternary Science Reviews (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.quascirev.2010.08.002coarse angular and sub-angular small to medium pebbles (Fig. 4).\nAt Loch Etive, the core consists of an upper lithological unit of\nbrown-dark\/brown silty clay peat with lenses of \ufb01ne, medium and\nsome coarse sand. Rootlets are present throughout this upper unit\nwhich extends from the marsh surface at 1.41 m OD to depth\ndown 24 cm (at1.17 m OD), over which the concentration visibly\ndecreases. Some laminated structure has also developed in the\nlower section of this peat unit. Underlying this is a shallow sub-unit\nof light-brown\/tan \ufb01ne to medium sand with occasional clasts of\n\ufb01ne gravel material extending down-core from 24 cm to 29 cm (at\n1.12 m OD). Lenses of organic-rich material are evident at the base\nof this sub-unit close to the quite sharp boundary with the\nunderlying unit (Fig. 4). Here a signi\ufb01cant change in lithology\noccurs with the presence of a 12 cm depth sub-unit of very dark-\nbrown\/black silty soil with \ufb01ne tomedium clasts of angular granite-\ntype gravel (present at 1.12e1.0 m OD). Preserved and fragmented\nrootlets are recorded in this sub-unit but are not as prevalent as in\nthe upper peat layer. The basal unit of the core consists of light-\nbrown medium to coarse sand which has been deposited upon an\nunderlying substrate of semi-rounded large cobble-sized material\nand extends to an altitude of 0.88 m OD, belowwhich the substrate\ncould not be penetrated (Fig. 4).\nLoss on ignition (via 550 \u0005C proxy method) pro\ufb01les indicate\na lower section in all cores with low organic content situated at\ndepths below 40 cm in the Loch Don, Creran and Etive marshes\nwith this organic-poor basal layer situated below 55 cm in the core\nfrom Loch Scridain. Above these depth horizons, organic carbon\ncontent increases towards the marsh surface, \ufb02uctuating between\n4.8 and 12.2 (% ashedmass). The exception to this is the pro\ufb01le from\nthe Loch Etive marsh, which reveals the presence of a dark rela-\ntively organic-rich silty unit with maximum values approaching 15\n(% ashed mass) between 30 and 40 cm depth. Above this depth\ninterval organic matter content decreases somewhat and then\nincreases gradually within the upper section of the core to\na maximum value of 11.4 (% ashed mass) at 5e6 cm depth. These\nvalues then decrease immediately above this sub-unit with a return\nto higher values (maximum 11% ashed mass) in the near-surface\nsediments. In the other three cores near-surface values are seen to\n\ufb02uctuate between 5 and 10 (% ashed mass). Dry bulk density (dry\nmass per unit wet volume) pro\ufb01les provide further indication of the\ncoarse nature of the lower sediments uponwhich themarshes have\ndeveloped with values \ufb02uctuating around 1.8 g cm \u00013. At depths\nwhere the organic component increases dry density values\ndecrease and are generally between 1.0 and 1.6 g cm\u00013. These\npro\ufb01les are remarkably uniform until the near-surface layers are\nreached where minor \ufb02uctuations in sediment density are evident.\nIn the Loch Etive core the dark silty sand unit with relatively high\norganic content shows a concomitant decrease in dry density with\nvalues of 1.1e1.3 g cm \u00013 (Fig. 4).\n5.2. Major element geochemistry\nMajor element oxide pro\ufb01les of SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, and CaO\nprovide a measure of the compositional variability through time\nand indicate that the elemental composition of each of the cores is\nbroadly similar (Fig. 4). Si is associated with the coarse sediment\nfraction. Al and K are useful proxies of clay content. However, these\ncan also be contained within the coarse fraction in the presence of\nalumino-silicate feldspars. SiO2 can be seen to \ufb02uctuate between\n>52 wt % and >72 wt % in the cores from sites on Mull and at Loch\nCreran. In the core from Loch Etive SiO2 values throughout the core\nare more uniform between 66 and 71 wt %. In all cores the pro\ufb01les\nof Al and K reveal the uniform deposition of clay material over time\nwith only minor \ufb02uctuations evident in the sediments from Loch\nCreran and Loch Etive atw20 cm and 30e40 cm depth respectively.imentation rates from shallow inter-tidal environments inwestern...,\nFig. 4.

Increases in\nCaO content at depth in the cores from Mull correspond to distinct\nchanges in sediment composition evident in the core stratigraphy\nand re\ufb02ect the nature of the coarse sand\/gravel contained in these\nlowermost sub-units (Fig. 4).\nThe relatively undisturbed nature of the Argyll marsh sediments\nis further revealed by the Al normalized pro\ufb01les for SiO2, TiO2 and\nK2O (Fig. 5), to take account of the constant sum problem (Roll-\ninson, 1992).\nThese pro\ufb01les suggest that the composition of accumulated\nmaterial has not \ufb02uctuated signi\ufb01cantly over time. However, The\nSi\/Al and Ti\/Al pro\ufb01les do imply signi\ufb01cant changes in grain size,\nsuggesting that AlO2maywell be associatedwith the coarse fraction\nin these marsh sediments. Coarsening of the sediment matrix is\nrevealed by increases in the ratio of these elements to clays (Spears\nand Kanaris-Sotiriou, 1976; Salomons and Mook, 1977). This effect\ncan be seen in themid-sections of the Si\/Al pro\ufb01les fromLochCreran\nand the Si\/Al and Ti\/Al pro\ufb01les from the Loch Etive marsh core.\n5.3. Redox zonation in the Argyll marshes\nRadiometric dating methods are highly dependent on a lack of\npost-depositional (redox-mediated) migration of the particular\nradionuclide activities measured (Cundy and Croudace, 1996). The\nbehaviour of the redox-sensitive elements Fe, Mn and S within\naquatic systems are well documented (Froelich et al., 1979;\nMcCaffrey and Thompson, 1980; Stumm and Morgan, 1981;\nGaillard et al., 1989; Burdige, 1993; Cundy and Croudace, 1995;\nThompson et al., 2002). Peaks in the down-core pro\ufb01les of these\nelements may be indicative of redox redistribution driven by\nbacterially-mediated early diagenetic chemical reactions. Fe and\nMn tend to precipitate within oxic conditions whereas an increase\nin S indicates the bacterial reduction of sulphate. Concentration\npeaks in the Fe, Mn and S distribution pro\ufb01les coincident with any\napparent in the radionuclide activity pro\ufb01les may therefore be\nindicative of post-depositional redistribution of 210Pb and 137Cs as\ndescribed by some authors (Evans et al., 1983; Comans et al., 1989;\nUrban et al., 1990; Benoit and Hemond, 1991).\nDistinct peaks in Fe and Mn are evident in the core pro\ufb01les from\nLoch Scridain, Loch Don and Loch Creran and are used to infer the\ndepth of the redox-cline within these sediments (Fig. 6).\nSulphur distributions show enrichment in the near-surface\nlayers of these cores consistent with the deposition of sulphide-rich\nminerals derived from the active erosion of the fronting marsh\/\nmud\/sand\ufb02at (see below). In the core from Loch Etive less\npronounced peaks in Fe andMn are visible above the black organic-\nrich silty sand layer from 29 to 30 cm depth to the marsh surface.\nWithin this sub-unit S is signi\ufb01cantly enriched. The high concen-\ntrations of organic matter may therefore have initiated localized\nsulphate reduction in this unit, as observed in organic-rich units\nwithin marine sediment cores (e.g. Thomson et al., 1993, 1996). In\nthe basal section of the cores the existence of highly anoxic sedi-\nments is not con\ufb01rmed owing to the low levels of S recorded in all\nfour cores.\nComparison of the Fe, Mn and S pro\ufb01les from the four marshes\nwith the down-core pro\ufb01les of 210Pbexcess and 137Cs activity\nstrongly suggest that redox processes have not in\ufb02uenced the\nhistorical record of radionuclide deposition. The inventory of both\nradionuclides used for dating is contained within the oxic sedi-\nments of the cores where incorporation into the solid-phase of the\nsediments acts to preserve the record of accumulation. Measurable\n137Cs activity is recorded at lower depths within the cores\nhowever, this does not appear to have compromised depth\/activity\nhorizons used for dating (see below). Field observations of \ufb02oo-\nding characteristics at each of the four sites indicate that thePlease cite this article in press as: Teasdale, P.A., et al., Recent estuarine sed\nQuaternary Science Reviews (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.quascirev.2010.08.002coring locations are only submerged during the High Water\nOrdinary Spring Tide (HWOST) periods. This may also account for\nthe development of strongly oxic conditions in the upper sections\nof the core.\n5.4.

In coastal marsh environments where\nsedimentation rates are likely to have varied over time, this model\nprovides a more robust method for the modelling of historical rates\nof marsh sediment accumulation (Cundy and Croudace, 1996).\n210Pbexcess CRS model calculated age\/depth and sedimentation\nrate\/age pro\ufb01les (Fig. 8) record a period of relatively high sedi-\nmentation rate at depths>20 cm, likely to be consistent with lower\nmarsh conditions, within all cores excepting that from Loch Creran.\nHere the lowermost section of the age\/depth curve displays rela-\ntively low accumulation rates which may have been in\ufb02uenced by\nthe\ufb02uvial bardepositswhichunderlie themarsh at this site, thereby\naffecting the height of these sediments relative to the tidal frame as\nthemarsh has developed, (detail inferred fromcoring investigations\nand \ufb01eld observation). Owing to low 210Pbexcess activities measured\nat depth, ages determined for the lowermost sections of the cores\nmust be treated with some degree of caution despite the fact that\nthesewere run for longer count times (<320 000 s) in an attempt to\nimprove detection ef\ufb01ciency and precision.\nIn the upper sections of the cores, the linear nature of the\n210Pbexcess (CRS model) age\/depth pro\ufb01les (Fig. 8) shows that\nsedimentation rates over the past c. 70 years have been relatively\nconstant up to very recent time periods.

These highlight the more subtle variations in rates of marsh\naccumulation between the four sites over lastw 70 year period. In\nthe Loch Scridain core, rates of sediment accretion were near-\nconstant throughout much of the Twentieth century to 1995AD\nwith values of 1.1 mm yr\u00011 (2 s range 0.8e1.3 mm yr \u00011). In the\ncores from Loch Don and Loch Creran sedimentation rates have\nbeen both higher and more variable throughout the last circa. 70\nyears with values of 2.4 mm yr\u00011 (2 s range 2.2e2.7 mm yr\u00011) and\n3.3 mm yr\u00011 (2 s range 2.7e4.3 m yr\u00011) respectively. Similar\ndevelopment of the core from Loch Etive is recorded over the last\ncircaw70 year period with an accumulation rate of 2.2 mm yr\u00011 (2\ns range 1.9e2.8 mm yr\u00011).\nIn the surface layers of all the cores, 210Pbexcess CRS model\ncalculations highlight the onset of recent and signi\ufb01cant increases\nin sedimentation rates in all four cores with recorded values\nranging between 5 and 10 mm yr\u00011 across the sites (Fig. 8).\n5.5. 137Cs\nMeasurement of 137Cs activity records a lower peak consistent\nwith 1963 weapons fallout maximum in the cores from Loch Don,\nLoch Creran and Loch Etive at depths of 8e9 cm. 210Pbexcess CRS\nmodel dates gives provide ages of 1964 (\u00031 year), 1964 (\u00031 year)\nand 1963 (\u00032 years) respectively for these marker horizons (Fig. 9).\nIn the core from Loch Scridain, a lower peak is visible at a shal-\nlower depth of 4e5 cm. 210Pb dating gives an estimated age for this\npeak of 1975 (\u00031 year) derived from the CRS model calculations.\nThe ascribed age from the model therefore indicates that this peak\nis likely to be more coincident with the period of maximum\ndischarge of 137Cs from Sella\ufb01eld.

Superimposed\nupon these activity levels, a distinct peak in the near-surface layers\nresulting from atmospheric and \ufb02uvial input of 137Cs derived from\nthe Chernobyl accident is apparent in the cores from Loch Don,\nLoch Creran and Loch Etive. The position and general shape of the\n137Cs activity pro\ufb01les in the cores from these sites bears a strong\nresemblance to the 137Cs pro\ufb01le shown in Callaway et al. (1996b),\nfrom the North Norfolk marshes UK, which also received signi\ufb01cant\ninput derived from Chernobyl. 210Pbexcess CRS model calculations\nfor these near-surface marker horizons yield dates of 1986 (\u00031\nyear), 1985 (\u00031 year) and 1985 (\u0003<2 years) for these marsh cores\nrespectively. An atmospheric source can be further invoked by\ncomparison of measured 137Cs inventories obtained from sub-\nmarine sediments from the outer basin of Loch Etive and other sub-\ntidal sea-loch locations in western Scotland (Krom et al., 2009),\nwith the marsh core inventories measured in this study (Table 1).\nAt these sites, the total inventory is several orders of magnitude\ngreater than that measured within the inter-tidal marshes, signi-\nfying the dominance of Sella\ufb01eld derived radio-caesium within\nthese deeper sediments. The lower inventory recorded in themarsh\ncores highlights a relatively weaker Sella\ufb01eld signature which has\nbeen overprinted and partially obscured by catchment (terrestrial)\nsources of Cs (weapons-test fallout and Chernobyl), due to greater\ncatchment versus marine inputs of radionuclides and radionuclide\nlabeled sediment being supplied to the high marsh settings. This is\nfurther supported by the earlier work of Williams et al. (1988) whoTable 1\nComparison between inter-tidal marsh core inventories of 137Cs with those from\nFjord-mouth (sub-tidal) sediments from proximal sites in western Scotland (Krom\net al., 2009).\nSite Location 137Cs Inventories (Bq\/m\u00012)\nInter-tidal marsh sites (this study)\nLoch Scridain 1015 \u0003 76\nLoch Don 2122 \u0003 278\nLoch Creran 3384 \u0003 395\nLoch Etive 1518 \u0003 95\nFjord-mouth (sub-tidal) sites (data from Krom et al., 2009)\nLoch Etive (core-ET 7\/8) 5134\nLoch Sunart (core-2422) 10114\nPlease cite this article in press as: Teasdale, P.A., et al., Recent estuarine sed\nQuaternary Science Reviews (2010), doi:10.1016\/j.quascirev.2010.08.002recorded lowlevels of activity for a range of radionuclides in sur\ufb01cial\nsediments within the outer and inner basins of Loch Etive.\nIn the core fromLochScridain, anear-surfacebroaderpeak in 137Cs\nactivity isnotdiscernableas input fromtheChernobyl accidentowing\nto a 210Pbexcess CRS model age of 1975. This date and the character-\nistics of this peak strongly suggest the in\ufb02uence of Sella\ufb01eld derived\n137Cs, which has swamped any activity resulting fromChernobyl. It is\nalsopossible that the comparatively lowermeasured activityand lack\nof a distinct upper peak here also suggests that the site at Loch Scri-\ndainmay not have been directly affected by the Chernobyl cloud that\npassed over western Scotland (Cambray et al., 1987).\n137Cs rates of accretion are simply a function of x\/t (where\nx \u00bc the depth of accumulated sediment and t \u00bc time of known\nmaximum inputs). Sediment accumulation rates using the 137Cs\nmarker horizons are shown in Table 2. These are in good agreement\nwith the 210Pb CRSmodeled ages for the upper sections of the cores.\nUse of the depth\/time increment assigned to maximum Sella\ufb01eld\ndischarges in the Loch Scridain core yields an estimation of sedi-\nment accumulation of 1.4 mmyr\u00011 which is also in good agreement\nwith the 210Pb derived estimations at this site.\n137Cs distributions show measurable activity levels within all\ncores at depths that pre-date both weapons-test fallout and\ndischarges from the BNFL Sella\ufb01eld facility. This indicates that some\ndown-core remobilization of 137Cs has occurred, most probably\nwithin the pore waters of the marsh sediments that containChernobyl accident. For the Loch Scridain core a broad peak in Cs activity at\n4e5 cm suggests a source derived from Sella\ufb01eld. Using maximum discharge in the\nperiod 1974e75 and the calculated CRS model age here of 1975 yields a sedimen-\ntation rate of 1.8 mm yr\u00011, in agreement with the 1963 Weapons-test signature rate\nof accumulation.

Within the near-surface layers, sediment dry\nmass accumulation rates can be seen to increase signi\ufb01cantly\nsupporting the radiometric age vs. depth \ufb01ndings. 137Cs marker\nhorizons also help to constrain the evidence for a regional recent\nincrease in marsh sedimentation rates at the four sites. Subtle\nincreased dry mass accumulation is recorded when using the pre-\n1963 AD weapons-test fallout at three of the sites, the 1975 marker\nhorizon (in the Loch Scridain core) and the recorded 1986 Cher-\nnobyl marker horizons, with the latter yielding slightly higher\nvalues. This is not an unrealistic \ufb01nding as the recent increase in\nsedimentation post-dates the Chernobyl event.\n5.7. Diatom analysis\nDiatom assemblage data from the Loch Etive core is shown in\nFig. 11.\nThe diagram highlights the variability in the distribution of taxa\nrelated to the visual and geochemical changes in lithology shown in\nFigs. 5 and 6. The base of the core is dominated by marine and\nbrackish taxa (e.g. Cocconeis scutellumvar. scutellum,Navicula directa,\nAchnanthes delicatula and Pinnularia lundii var. baltica). These\ndecrease markedly and give rise to the dominance of oligohalobous\ntaxa (e.g. Eunotia spp., Navicula radiosa and Tabellaria \ufb02oculosa)\nwithin the black silty organic-rich sand unit situated between 29 and\n41 cm depth. Immediately above this sub-unit the \ufb01ne\/medium grey\nsand unit reveals a return to brackish and marine species similar to\nthe lower sand unit at the base of the core. Throughout the upper\nmarsh peat unit the polyhalobous and in particular, mesohalobous\ntaxa dominate the species assemblage and in conjunction with the\nsmall \ufb02uctuating background oligohalobous speciesmaintain a near-\nconstant ratio extending up to the near-surface layers.

In the\nuppermost sections of the core the species relative abundance alters\nand shows distinct evidence of an increase in the marine (poly-\nhalobous) species occurring on the mature marsh surface.\nBased upon the recent changes in relative species abundance\nevident within the upper surface layers of the core from Loch Etive,\ndiatom analysis of the other three cores focuses attention on the\nupper sections (w10 cm depth). Diatom down-core distributions\nfrom the Loch Scridain, Loch Don and Loch Creran marsh cores are\nshown in Fig. 12 (aec).\nThese diagrams clearly demonstrate that stable sedimentary\nconditions have also prevailed throughout the various time\nperiods indicated by the 210Pb dating. Brackish water taxa including\nA. delicatula, Cosmioneis pusilla, Diploneis interupta, Navicula skevi-\nsensis, Nitzschia littoralis, Opephora mutabilis, Opephora swartzii and\nPlanothidium delicatulum, dominate the relative species abundance\nexpressed here as percentage total diatom valves. Polyhalobian taxa\nalso constitute a percentage of the recorded taxa presentwith species\nsuch as Cocconeis costata var. costata, C. scutellum var. scutellum,\nFallacia hyalinula and Opephora schultzii shown to be present\nthroughout the depth\/time horizons. Oligohalobous taxa are repre-\nsented in comparatively reduced relative abundance and include\nspecies suchasA.delicatula,Martyanamartyii,N. radiosaandT.\ufb02oculosa.\nVery subtle increases in the relative species abundance of pol-\nyhalobian taxa (listed above) are recorded in the near-surface\nsediments of the marshes at Loch Scridain and Loch Creran,\n(Fig. 12a and c) with additional species e.g. Navicula libonensis,\nNavicula phyllepta and Planothidium polaris that are less evident\nwithin the sub-surface sediments. There is little evidence to\nsuggest increasing percentages of polyhalobian taxa in the upper\nsection of the Loch Don core (Fig. 12b).\n6. Discussion\n6.1.

Similar scenarios\nhave been reported by other workers, where 137Cs has been used as\na dating tool (Thompson et al., 2002). Overall, the presence of two\ndistinct peaks relating to 1963 weapons-test fallout and the 1986\nChernobyl accident provide usefulmarkerhorizons for comparisons\nwith 210Pbexcess-derived rates of sediment accretion in the LochDon,\nLochCreran andLoch Etivemarsh sediments. Despite themaskingof\nboth a pre-1963 weapons-test marker horizon and Chernobyl\nderived 137Cs in the core from Loch Scridain, the broad activity peak\ncentered around 4e5 cm depth, corresponds to a 210Pbexcess CRS\nmodel age of 1975AD. This calculated age correspondswell with the\nperiod of maximum discharges from the BNFL Sella\ufb01eld facility\nwhich occurred in 1974 and conforms well with the estimated\ntransportation lag time of w1 year to western Scottish coastal\nwaters suggested by Livingstone et al. (1982a; 1982b). Therefore,\nthis peak may also be used as a suitable marker horizon to assess\nsedimentation rates within this core. Calculated rates of sediment\naccretion from the four sites using 210Pbexcess models are in good\nagreement with the data obtained using 137Cs dating. In the core\nfrom Loch Scridain, situated on the periphery of the uplift dome,\na sedimentation rate of 1.1 mm yr\u00011 suggests a quasi-equilibrium\nrelationship between estimated sea-level rise for the region\n(1.0 mm yr\u00011 \u0003 0.15 mm yr\u00011), Shennan and Woodworth (1992),\nvertical marsh accretion and estimated residual crustal uplift\nthroughoutmuchof theTwentieth century (FirthandStewart, 2000;\nShennan and Horton, 2002; Terferle et al., 2009; Gehrels, in press).\nHigher rates of sedimentation are recorded in the cores from\nLoch Don (south-east Isle of Mull), Loch Creran and Loch Etive\n(mainland Argyll). The more variable sedimentation rates over the\nlast c.70 years within the cores from these three sites may represent\nepisodes of \u2018catch-up\u2019 in more youthful marsh settings in response\nto earlier periods of lower sediment availability (Allen, 1990a). This\ntype of morphological response has also been reported from the\nmore organic-rich marshes in Connecticut, USA (McCaffrey and\nThompson, 1980).\nThree of the cores examined in this study (Loch Scridain, Loch\nDon and Loch Creran) are from mature marsh settings with macro-\ntidal ranges in excess of 4 m at High Water Ordinary Spring Tides\n(HWOST), whereas the Loch Etive site furthermost to the east is\nmicro-tidal with a range of 1.8 m at MHWOST. Previous studies\nhave highlighted the in\ufb02uence of tidal range on marsh sedimen-\ntation rates within largely macro-tidal settings (e.g. Chmura et al.,\n2001; Haslett et al., 2003) and have reported reduced rates of\nsedimentation with increasing tidal range. The differential tidal\nrange between macro and micro-tidal settings examined in this\nstudy does not appear to have resulted in signi\ufb01cant variations in\nrecorded sedimentation rates occurring on the macro-tidal mature\nmarsh settings and the marsh surface at Loch Etive. Additionally,\nthere seems to be no evidence of marsh sedimentation rates being\nin\ufb02uenced by the 18.6-year tidal modulation as has been previously\nhighlighted by Cahoon et al. (2000) and French and Burningham\n(2003) for other UK allochthonous dominated marsh systems.\nDiatom analysis of the core sequences provides additional\nevidence indicating that marsh development has been stable\nmaintaining their position relative to the tidal frame with no\nsigni\ufb01cant change in species assemblages. Data from the study sites\nis comparable to the study by Haslett et al.

Recent marsh sediment accumulation\nWithin the near-surface layers of all the cores the radiometric\ndating models identify a very recent and signi\ufb01cant increase in\nsedimentation now taking place on the marsh surfaces with rates\nranging from between 5.0 and 9.8 mm yr\u00011. These rates greatly\nexceed the estimations provided in the study by Pethick (1999) for\na projected sea-level rise of c. 4 mm yr\u00011 to 2050 AD for the west\ncoast of Scotland and those proposed in the study of Dawson et al.\n(2001) who suggest a scenario of differential relative sea-level rise\nto 2050 AD across the Scottish uplift dome in response to residual\nGIA, determined from tide-gauge data from stations other than that\nfrom Aberdeen with shorter temporal records (Fig. 13).\nOf major importance here is the relative position of the marshes\ninvestigated in this study relative to the zones de\ufb01ned by Dawson\net al. (2001). The marsh at the head of Loch Scridain is situated\napproximately on the border of their proposed zones I and II where\nrelative sea-level is predicted to have been falling or RSL tendency\nis uncertain. Rates of sedimentation obtained from this core suggest\nthat this site is more compatible with zone III of Dawson et al.\n(2001) (Fig. 13).\nIn the near-surface layers of the Argyll marshes, measured\nsedimentation rates show a signi\ufb01cant increase at all sites across\nthe proposed uplift dome and provide evidence that a regional\nthreshold in response to coastal forcing has been exceeded. Active\nerosion of fronting areas of low marsh settings is apparent at all\nsites where tidal scour has resulted in remnant marsh tussock\nmorphology and the removal of material exposing large sections of\nunderlying \ufb02uvial substrate, with little evidence that new pioneer\nenvironments are forming. This morphological adjustment, which\ncorresponds to the predictions of the one-dimensional models of\nmarsh behaviour (Allen, 1990a) and empirical studies (Orson et al.,\n1985; Reed, 1990, 1995; vanWijnen and Bakker, 2001; Temmerman\net al., 2003; Goodman et al., 2007) is possibly being enhanced by\nthe less cohesive nature of the Argyll marsh sediments in\ncomparison to other more southerly, clay-rich UK marsh environ-\nments (Cundy and Croudace, 1996). This may provide an explana-\ntion for the enhanced rates of vertical accretionwhich are currently\nexceeding 20th Century and more recent estimations of global sea-\nlevel rise (Peltier and Tushingham, 1989; Nakada and Inoue, 2005;\nChurch and White, 2006). It is important to note here that no\nassessment of tidal funneling within the constricted head of theimentation rates from shallow inter-tidal environments inwestern...,\nTable 3\nSummary of evidence derived from the various methods of enquiry to support the hypothesis of recent relative sea-level rise in western Scotland.\nMethod of enquiry\/\nanalysis\nKey \ufb01ndings\nRadiometric\ndating\n210Pb A recent signi\ufb01cant increase in the rate of sediment accretion (ranging from 5 to 10 mm yr\u00011) on the surface of the Argyll marshes derived\nfrom the 210Pbexcess CRS model dating. These rates are some 2e3 times the estimated values for much of the 20th Century and imply\nthat a regional geomorphological threshold has been crossed at all sites along the transect over the proposed uplift dome.\n137Cs Effectively supports the 210Pb dating results for estimated rates of accretion. Importantly, rates of accretion are higher using the 1986\nAD Chernobyl marker horizon in comparison to that from the 1963 AD Weapons-Test signature indicating a sedimentation increase\nafter 1986 AD. Cumulative dry mass\/age pro\ufb01les also show a signi\ufb01cant increase in the near-surface layers of the marshes.\nComparison of these pro\ufb01les with the near-exponential decline in 210Pb activities strongly suggest that this is due to increased\nsedimentation rather than slight sur\ufb01cial mixing of 210Pb in the surface layers.\nMicrofossil (diatom\nanalysis)\nA recent increase in the relative abundance of various polyhalobous taxa in the near-surface sediments of three of the marsh cores,\nindicating a more dominant marine source for recent sedimentation.\nGeomorphology\n(\ufb01eld observations)\nSigni\ufb01cant active erosion of the frontal sections of marshes at all four sites.

Any such response to regional\nsea-level rise may well be exerting additional in\ufb02uence upon\nsediment erosion through enhancement of tidal current velocities.\nThe distribution of diatom taxa in the near-surface sediments\nprovides evidence that the source of new material being deposited\non the marsh surfaces is of marine\/inter-tidal origin, identi\ufb01ed by\nthe subtle increases in polyhalobian benthic and planktonic taxa\nwithin three of the four cores studied.\nGeophysical models predict ongoing uplift of the Scottish\nlandmass resulting from GIA adjustment processes (Shennan,\n1983a,b; Lambeck, 1993b; Peltier et al., 2000; Shennan and\nHorton, 2002). These rheological models are largely constrained\nby mid-late Holocene 14C dating of raised marine sediments. As\nsuch the models therefore represent a \ufb01rst estimate with regard to\npresent day\/recent geodynamics within western Scotland with\nmaximum crustal uplift values of <2 mm yr\u00011 (Shennan, 1983a,b),\nrecently revised by Shennan and Horton (2002). Firth and Stewart\n(2000) suggest that these rates are in fact lower and provide revised\nestimates of 0.2e0.5 mm yr\u00011, in good agreement with the recent\nmodeled estimations of Bradley et al. (2009). If these estimates are\ncorrect then it is entirely feasible that current estimates of sea-level\nrise highlighted by Church et al. (2004) and Church and White\n(2006) are now outpacing rates of crustal uplift thereby exerting\nsigni\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on the morphological development of coastal\nmarshes across the proposed uplift dome. Rates of marsh sedi-\nmentation for the two key periods de\ufb01ned by this study are\ncompared with the estimations for crustal uplift in Fig. 14 and\na summary of the study \ufb01ndings from the various lines of enquiry\nare presented in Table 3.\n7. Conclusions\n210Pbexcess and 137Cs activity pro\ufb01les provide accurate and reli-\nable constraints upon marsh development and sediment accumu-\nlation within shallow inter-tidal environments in Argyll.\nGeochemical compositional characteristics provide strong evidence\nthat stable depositional conditions have prevailed during the\nhistorical period of marsh development. This is further supported\nby the down-core distribution of diatom taxa which indicate\na quasi-equilibrium relationship with sea-level rise during the 20th\nCentury.

This is likely to\nhave taken place as a result of pore water movements within the\n\ufb02uctuating redox conditions that occur when the mature marsh\nsurfaces are \ufb02ooded during Spring tides. However, this has not\nsigni\ufb01cantly compromised the measured activity pro\ufb01les used for\ndating purposes and as such the dating undertaken in the study is\nconsidered to be robust.\nOn the periphery of the uplift dome at Loch Scridain, the marsh\nhas been accumulating in quasi-equilibrium with estimated sea-\nlevel rise and residual crustal uplift. At the more easterly sites, in\ncloser proximity to the hypothesized centre of uplift, marsh sedi-\nmentation rates over the past c. 70 years have generally exceeded\nestimations for 20th C global sea-level rise and residual crustal\nuplift although a quasi-equilibrium is still indicated by the distri-\nbutions of diatom taxa. These increased rates of sediment accu-\nmulation over small age\/depth horizons within the three cores\nprobably re\ufb02ects periods of \u2018catch-up\u2019 in these more youthful\nmarshes in response to \ufb02uctuations in local sediment supply.\nIn the near-surface sediments, a signi\ufb01cant increase in rates of\nsediment accumulation is recorded in all the marsh cores. Diatom\nanalysis of these surface sediments indicates that the recent\nsediment accumulation is of marine origin. These \ufb01ndings show\nthat the Argyll marshes are now experiencing marine trans-\ngression at all four study sites across the uplift dome and provide\ncompelling evidence that regional sea-level rise would now\nappear to be the dominant process affecting relative sea-level\nmovements in western Scotland. This has important implications\nfor future coastal development in Scotland, particularly within\nlow-lying estuarine settings more peripheral to the centre of\nuplift. Further a \ufb01eld where GIA processes are negligible or are\nresponsible for continued crustal subsidence, marshes may be\nrecording a signi\ufb01cant morphological response to current esti-\nmates of sea-level rise.\nProvided that rigorous assessment of 210Pb and 137Cs dating\nmethods is undertaken, these tools can be effectively utilizedwithin\ncoastal wetlands to develop reliable geochronological models of\nmarsh sediment accumulation. Such models therefore provide\na robustmeansof comparing thehistorical responseofmarsheswithimentation rates from shallow inter-tidal environments inwestern...,\nQ3Q4\nQ5\nQ6\nQ7\n8\nP.A.
