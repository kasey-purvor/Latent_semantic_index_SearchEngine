A variety of initia-\ntives, such as multimedia broadcast and multicast\nservices (MBMS), digital video broadcasting-\nhandheld (DVB-H), and terrestrial\/satellite-digi-\ntal multimedia broadcasting (T\/S-DMB) are\nenvisaged to provide one-to-many content distri-\nbution to mobile users. The 3rd Generation\nPartnership Project (3GPP) MBMS framework\n[1] defines a unidirectional point-to-multipoint\nmode for providing multimedia services and\nthereby, optimizes the available capacity in cellu-\nlar networks. DVB-H [2], as initiated by the\nDVB forum, implements additional features\nbased on the DVB-T standard to address the\nspecific constraints associated with mobile hand-\nheld terminals. At the same time, the media for-\nward link only (MediaFLO) [3] air interface\nspecification developed by Qualcomm was\nrecently approved by the Telecommunications\nIndustry Association (TIA) as a new air inter-\nface standard for multicast delivery, aimed at\ndelivering cost-efficient and high-quality multi-\nmedia services to the U.S. mobile market.\nAs a complementary alternative to 3G mobile\nnetworks, the S-DMB system is attracting a great\ndeal of attention within the satellite community\n[4] as a cost-effective approach for the delivery\nof MBMS to mobile users over satellite broad-\ncasting networks. Based on its broadcast nature,\nthe S-DMB system offers extensive coverage,\nlow transmission cost for large numbers of ter-\nminals, as well as high QoS guarantees for multi-\nmedia provisioning. By employing the wideband\ncode-division multiple access (WCDMA) with\nfrequency division duplexing (FDD), the system\ncan be closely integrated with existing mobile\ncellular networks and minimize the potential\ncost impact on both 3G cellular terminals and\nnetwork operators. The whole range of issues\npertinent to the S-DMB system, from system\ndefinition to demonstration and validation, are\naddressed in the following European IST pro-\njects: Mobile Applications & sErvices Satellite &\nTerrestrial inteRwOrking (MAESTRO) and\nMobile Digital broadcast Satellite (MoDiS).\nGiven the unidirectional nature and the point-\nto-multipoint services it provides that are aimed\nat maximizing spectrum efficiency and satisfying\ndiverse QoS, the design of radio resource man-\nagement (RRM) functionality implemented at\nthe S-DMB access layer is challenging. The pack-\net scheduling, which is the single function per-\nforming short-term resource allocation, is the\nfocus of efficient resource allocation.\nHerein the packet scheduling is envisaged at\nABSTRACT\nIn recent years, multimedia content broad-\ncasting via satellite has attracted increased atten-\ntion. The satellite digital multimedia\nbroadcasting (S-DMB) system has emerged as\none of the most promising alternatives for the\nefficient delivery of multimedia broadcast multi-\ncast service (MBMS). The design of an efficient\nradio resource management (RRM) strategy,\nespecially the packet scheduling scheme,\nbecomes a key technique for provisioning multi-\nmedia services at required quality of service\n(QoS) in S-DMB. In this article, we propose a\nnovel cross-layer packet scheduling scheme that\nconsists of a combined delay and rate differenti-\nation (CDRD) service prioritization algorithm\nand a dynamic rate matching (DRM)-based\nresource allocation algorithm. The proposed\nscheme considers multiple key factors that span\nfrom the application layer to the physical layer,\naiming at simultaneously guaranteeing diverse\nQoS while utilizing radio resources efficiently\nunder the system power and resource constraints.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the pro-\nposed cross-layer scheme achieves significantly\nbetter performance than existing schemes in\nqueuing delay, jitter, and channel utilization.\nADVANCES IN MOBILE MULTIMEDIA\nHongfei Du, Linghang Fan, Upendra Mudugamuwa, and Barry G.

First, the service prioritization procedure\ntakes into account the service types and QoS\nrequirements in terms of maximum tolerable\nqueuing delay and required data rate. Second, the\nqueuing dynamics are envisaged effectively into\nservice prioritization to track the instantaneous\ntraffic variations at the radio link control (RLC)\nlayer. Furthermore, the instantaneous data rate at\nthe transport channel (TrCH) is envisaged as\nanother important criterion to minimize the\nunnecessary discontinuous transmission (DTX)\nand thereby, optimize the resource utilization.\nThe proposed cross-layer packet scheduling\nalgorithm is distinct from most existing schemes\n[5, 6] in that:\n\u2022 It guarantees the prescribed QoS require-\nments.\n\u2022 Simultaneously, it considers multiple cross-\nlayer criteria and balances the priority and\nfairness.\n\u2022 A DRM technique is applied to resource\nallocation to reduce unnecessary puncturing\nand repetition and optimize the transmit\npower.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to investigate the cross-layer optimization\nthat combines QoS requirements, queuing\ndynamics, and rate matching information togeth-\ner in the packet scheduling decision.\nThe article continues with the background\ndescription of the S-DMB system and the respec-\ntive issues pertinent to RRM, highlighting some\nresearch challenges and opportunities for packet\nscheduling design. The subsequent section details\nthe proposed cross-layer packet scheduling\nscheme. Simulation performance of the pro-\nposed scheme is then presented, followed by the\nconclusion of the article.\nBACKGROUND\nS-DMB SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the S-DMB system defines\na hybrid satellite-terrestrial communication sys-\ntem, featuring a geostationary satellite component\nthat is responsible for MBMS delivery and pro-\nvides a European coverage by multiple umbrella\ncells. Being closely integrated into the 2.5G\/3G\nbaseline architecture, the system enjoys maximum\nreuse of technology and infrastructure and mini-\nmum system development cost. The hybrid system\ntakes advantage of the satellite broadcast capabil-\nity to provide efficient delivery of MBMS content\nto an extensive mass mobile market.\nThe S-DMB radio interface employs an adap-\ntation of the WCDMA, with the satellite gate-\nway hosting both the radio network controller\n(RNC) and the Node B functional entities. The\nuser equipment (UE) applies the standard 3G\nterminal, enriched with S-DMB-enabling func-\ntions, which given the unidirectional nature, are\nvery limited. The terrestrial gap-fillers, identified\nas intermediate module repeater (IMR), are col-\nlocated at the terrestrial base stations to enhance\nsignal reception quality and provide adequate\ncoverage in urban and built-up areas. The S-\nDMB-enabled broadcast\/multicast service center\n(BMSC), is enhanced with S-DMB-specific func-\ntions from the standard 3GPP MBMS BMSC. It\nis noteworthy that no direct return link via satel-\nlite is envisaged under the baseline S-DMB\ninfrastructure; rather, the return path is provid-\ned via the terrestrial networks if required.\nRRM\nIn S-DMB, the RRM functionality comprises\nthree main parts: radio resource allocation\n(RRA), packet scheduling, and admission con-\ntrol. This functionality cooperates interactively\nduring resource allocation procedures.\nThe RRA is responsible for the radio bearer\nconfiguration at the beginning of each session start,\nn Figure 1.

However, its role in assuring compre-\nhensive QoS guarantees remains crucial for mul-\ntimedia provisioning.\nRATE MATCHING\nThe provisioning of multimedia applications\ninvolves highly variable bit rates. Therefore, it is\nhighly desirable that the available radio\nresources can be utilized efficiently and adap-\ntively in response to the data rate dynamics.\nTo satisfy the physical layer supportable\nframe structure prior to the transport channel\nmultiplexing, rate matching (RM) is performed\nat the physical layer to match the encoded TrCH\ndata rates to the allowed physical channel data\nrates by either puncturing or repeating bits to\nthe TrCH. The objective of this function is to\nminimize unnecessary DTX insertions so as to\nreduce the transmission power-off periods.\nTime multiplexing from TrCH to physical\nchannels is performed independently from other\nphysical layer functions, such as CRC addition,\nturbo coding, and interleaving. However, the RM\nfunction, which is an essential part of the trans-\nport channel coding and multiplexing mechanism,\nplays a crucial role in efficient resource allocation.\nMOTIVATIONS AND RESEARCH CHALLENGE\nThe unique features of the S-DMB system\nrestrict the effectiveness and efficiency on short-\nterm resource allocation functions. The design of\npacket scheduling proves to be challenging for\nthe following reasons:\n\u2022 The system suffers from the long delay asso-\nciated with the geostationary satellite link,\nwhich makes the channel-state-dependent\nscheduling and the fast power control\nmechanism unfeasible.\n\u2022 Its unidirectional nature accompanied with\nthe built-in broadcast multicast mode fur-\nther aggravates the design difficulty on a\nfeasible packet scheduling scheme.\n\u2022 The total available power for all the physi-\ncal channels within a single satellite beam is\nlimited, and the packet scheduler must be\ndesigned such that it satisfies the power\nconstraint and minimizes unnecessary\npower consumption.\n\u2022 Multimedia applications feature stringent\nand diverse QoS requirements, hence the\ndesign of a packet scheduler must take into\naccount both the differentiation and fulfill-\nment of these requirements.\nTherefore, the design of an efficient packet\nscheduling scheme in S-DMB requires compre-\nhensive considerations on both system con-\nstraints and QoS satisfactions.\nAlthough a variety of packet scheduling algo-\nrithms are proposed in the literature for both wired\nand wireless networks [5], they cannot be applied\ndirectly to the S-DMB network due to its unique\narchitectural constraints. Previous studies [6] have\nsystematically addressed the packet scheduling\nproblems in S-DMB via adaptation of two well-\nknown scheduling schemes, namely multi-level pri-\nority queuing (MLPQ) and weighted fair queuing\n(WFQ), both of which feature major weaknesses in\nproviding QoS-differentiated multimedia services\nwith respect to efficiency and fairness.\nMLPQ serves a queue, based on its traffic\npriority; low-priority service may suffer from\nconsiderably longer queuing delays. Round-robin\nis employed among queues with the same priori-\nty, providing no differentiation for services with\nthe same QoS rank.\nIn WFQ, queues are prioritized based on\ntheir required data rates, while the time-stamps\nof the head packets are considered for queues\nwith the same data rate. Since no QoS differen-\ntiation is envisaged, the performance of WFQ is\neven worse than that of MLPQ in terms of both\ndelay and delay variation (jitter) [6].\nAn existing static rate matching (SRM) tech-\nnique calculates the rate matching ratios (RMR),\nthat is, the percentage of bits required to be\npunctured\/repeated against the total information\ndata, based on the maximum allowed data rates\nof the TrCH at the beginning of each session\nstart. RMR remain unchanged during the ses-\nsion transmission. Consequently, unnecessary\nDTX insertion in the physical layer occurs when-\never the instantaneous data rates of TrCH are\nless than their maximum data rates. This can\nresult in unnecessary puncturing and repetition\nand inefficient resource and power utilization\nbecause the base station transmit power is wast-\ned during these DTX power-off periods.\nCROSS-LAYER PACKET SCHEDULING\nOVERVIEW\nFigure 2 illustrates the layer\/sublayer interactions\nof the proposed cross-layer packet scheduling\nscheme. The RRM mainly is handled at the data\nlink layer, which can be further divided into radio\nresource control (RRC), RLC, and MAC sublay-\ners. The proposed cross-layer\/sublayer correspon-\ndence is set up, from both upward and downward\ndirections. During the radio bearer configuration,\nthe RRA abstracts the prescribed QoS demands\nfrom each session when it starts and passes them\nto the packet scheduler as one set of priority cri-\nThe provisioning of\nmultimedia \napplications involves\nhighly variable bit\nrates. Therefore, it is\nhighly desirable that\nthe available radio\nresources can be \nutilized efficiently\nand adaptively in\nresponse to the data\nrate dynamics.\nDU LAYOUT  7\/19\/07  12:03 PM  Page 96\nIEEE Communications Magazine \u2022 August 2007 97\nteria. The queuing dynamics in the RLC buffer\nare monitored and passed to the packet sched-\nuler as another set of priority criteria. We employ\na joint priority function (JPF) in the packet\nscheduler to handle the previous priority criteria\nand derive the serving orders of competing flows.\nThe parameters considered in the JPF can be\ngrouped into two categories:\n\u2022 QoS parameters\n\u2022 Queuing dynamic parameters\nThe parameters in the first category depend on\nthe application and are derived on a per-session\nscale that remains constant during the session\ntransmission, while the parameters in the second\ncategory track the instantaneous queuing behav-\niors at the forward access channel (FACH)\nqueue in the RLC buffer on a per-TTI scale.\nIn the S-DMB system, the service types are\nconsidered as streaming, hot download, and cold\ndownload and described as follows:\n\u2022 Streaming enables multimedia to be stored\ntemporarily in the receiver buffer and dis-\nplayed continuously even before the com-\npletion of transmission. Service in this\ncategory requires explicit upper bound on\nqueuing delay and jitter.\n\u2022 Hot download enables the data to be stored\nat the receiver for offline access. Compared\nwith streaming, the hot download service has\nmore tolerant demand on delay and jitter\nbut more stringent demand on packet loss.\n\u2022 Cold download requires the least demand\non delay and jitter but the most stringent\ndemand on packet loss. Services in this cat-\negory are often transmitted as an individual\nfile, such as software packages,\nvideo\/images, and text messages.\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween an MBMS session and an MBMS point-\nto-multipoint traffic channel (MTCH) logical\nchannel. The logical channels then are mapped\nin a one-to-one manner to the FACH transport\nchannel. The scheduled packets are delivered to\nthe secondary common control physical channel\n(S-CCPCH) in the form of transport block (TB)\n[7]. One or more FACH(s) are carried by a sin-\ngle S-CCPCH via transport channel multiplexing\nat the physical layer. For each active physical\nchannel, the exact format of the transport for-\nmat combination (TFC), which consists of multi-\nple transport block sets (TBS), is selected from\nthe transport format combination set (TFCS).\nThe framework of the proposed packet\nscheduling scheme is illustrated in Fig. 3. The\npacket scheduling strategy can be conceptualized\ninto the following two main steps:\n1. Service prioritization: The incoming service\nrequests are ordered according to the prior-\nity criteria. In selecting the respective crite-\nria, the service attributes are considered to\nprovide the scheduling task while consider-\ning multiple and essential QoS factors.\n2. Resource allocation: After all of the multi-\nplexed sessions are prioritized, resources\nare allocated accordingly to these sessions\nthat consist of bit rate and transmit power\nassignments within the specific resource\nallocation interval (i.e., one TTI).\nCDRD SERVICE PRIORITIZATION\nAdvances in multimedia applications require the\nRRM scheme to support diverse QoS among het-\nerogeneous traffic. The proposed CDRD service\nprioritization algorithm takes into account multi-\nple key criteria simultaneously for assuring com-\nprehensive QoS satisfaction. On the one hand,\nthe CDRD scheme considers the application pre-\nscribed QoS requirements as a combination of\nmultiple attributes including traffic priority,\nrequired data rate, and queuing delay constraint.\nOn the other hand, the queuing dynamics of the\ncompeting flows at the RLC layer are captured\nfor further scheduling optimization.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3, each session is assumed\nto retain an individual FACH queue in the RLC\nn Figure 2.

Packets in the FACH queues are priori-\ntized according to their respective performance\nmetrics. The packet scheduler handles all the\nFACH queues according to their instant joint pri-\norities rather than the service types of the carried\ntraffic. By considering multiple performance crite-\nria, the packet scheduler can balance the perfor-\nmance in various aspects among heterogeneous\nmultimedia traffic with diverse QoS preferences.\nIn CDRD, the following criteria in the JPF\nare considered:\n\u2022 QoS class factor \u2014 This factor is essentially\na time-independent parameter designated\nfor each queue, representing heterogeneous\nservice types amongst competing sessions.\n\u2022 Data rate factor \u2014 This factor is calculated\nas the ratio of the required data rate against\nthe average transmitted data rate until cur-\nrent TTI. This factor effectively drives the\ninstantaneous achieved data rate of the ser-\nvice to its required data rate.\n\u2022 Delay constraint factor \u2014 This attribute is\ndetermined according to the difference\nbetween the average queuing delay and the\nmaximum queuing delay tolerated by the\ncorresponding service (i.e., delay thresh-\nold). Delay threshold can be regarded as a\ntunable parameter upon balancing the sys-\ntem performance. This factor is only effec-\ntive when the average queuing delay is\nbeyond the designated delay threshold.\nIn each TTI, the scheduler sorts the FACH\nqueues in descending order, according to their\ninstantaneous priorities calculated from the JPF\nfunction. Subsequently, the FACH queues with\nhigher priorities are served prior to their coun-\nterparts with lower priority.\nFrom the implementation point of view, the\nproposed CDRD algorithm introduces extra com-\nputation complexity due to its nonlinear (with loop\niterations for selection\/sort operation) and nonde-\nterministic (with unpredictable variables) nature.\nTo examine the scalability of the proposed CDRD\nalgorithm, the Big O notation [8] is employed for\ndetermining the involved computational complexi-\nty. We assume there are n sessions to be transmit-\nted to the UE that are located in multiple sectors\nof a satellite beam. The computational complexity\nfor CDRD algorithm is computed for a single TTI\nperiod. With the input size of the total number of\nthe FACH denoted by n, the CDRD algorithm\nrequires an overall computational complexity of\nO(n2), featuring typical quadratic statistics.\nDYNAMIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION\nDynamic Rate Matching \u2014 To minimize the\nDTX insertion and optimize the total power\nconsumption in downlink SRM, the DRM tech-\nnique was proposed for S-DMB in [9]. The\nobjective of downlink DRM is to minimize the\nnumber of DTX bits required for the selected\nTFC at a given TTI according to the available\nphysical layer resources. Rather than the rate\nmatching calculation in SRM, in the DRM, the\nRMR is calculated in each TTI, based on the\ninstantaneous data rate of each TrCH. There-\nfore, the DRM employs a variable RMR to pre-\nvent unnecessary DTX insertions. In each TTI,\nthe following phases are performed in DRM:\n\u2022 Phase 1 (TFC reordering): all the TFC within\nthe TFCS list are re-ordered according to\ntheir corresponding total data rates.\n\u2022 Phase 2 (RMR calculation): the RMR is cal-\nculated, based on the instantaneous data\nrate (i.e., the TBS size) of each TrCH for\neach different TFC allowed for a given\nphysical channel.\n\u2022 Phase 3 (bit matching): according to the\nselected TFC, a tentative value for repeti-\ntion and\/or puncturing bits is calculated for\neach TrCH.\nFinally, the rate matching module performs\nthe tentative value corrections, and a rate match-\ning pattern is generated.\nn Figure 3.

The\ntransmit power that was saved can be utilized for\nbetter performance on transmission capacity or\npacket loss rate. The main limitation of DRM is\nthat more processing and memory are required\nfor the rate matching calculation and storage.\nDRM-based Resource Allocation \u2014 The task\nof resource allocation is to select the required\nbit rate and transmit power for all physical chan-\nnels within the specific resource allocation inter-\nval (i.e., one TTI), subject to system constraints.\nAn existing SRM technique at the physical layer\nhas been traditionally designed separately from\nhigher layers. Based on the novel DRM tech-\nnique at the physical layer, we develop a cross-\nlayer design that optimizes the resource\nutilization at the data link layer to improve the\noverall system efficiency when combined with\nresource allocation at the data link layer.\nUnlike SRM, where the RMR is fixed during\nthe session transmission, in DRM, until all the ses-\nsions are scheduled, the precise RMR for each\nTrCH is unknown, and the DRM only knows the\npossible TFC candidates (i.e., a TFC subset). The\npower requirements for TrCH are evaluated based\non every possible TFC within the TFC subset. In\neach TTI, a TFC is selected for the given physical\nchannel; the DRM then calculates the number of\nbits required to be repeated or punctured.\nThe proposed DRA algorithm, as shown in\nFig. 4, relies on the DRM technique to evaluate\nthe required transmit power for respective TrCH\naccording to their instantaneous data rate\nrequirements. In this case, the physical layer\ninstantaneous supportable data rate is effectively\nthe TBS size that is allowed for the total trans-\nmit power estimation. In addition to the priority\ndecided by the service prioritization function,\nthe instantaneous data rate information is fed\ninto the resource allocation module for the\npower estimation. The derived TFC is thereby\npriority-based, DRM-associated, and data-rate-\nconfined, which is then allocated to the corre-\nsponding physical channel. In conclusion, the\nDRA algorithm offers two main advantages:\n\u2022 It allows better DTX minimization.\n\u2022 It requires less transmit power when the\ninstantaneous data rates are less than the\nmaximum data rate.\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nSIMULATION SCENARIOS\nTo demonstrate the performance enhancement of\nthe proposed cross-layer packet scheduling\nscheme, a system-level simulator implementing\nthe S-DMB system was developed with the aid of\nthe software package ns-2. The packet scheduler\nis physically implemented in the satellite gateway.\nThe streaming traffic model applies publicly avail-\nable trace files for video streaming traffic. Traffic\ncharacteristics associated with hot and cold down-\nload services follow the Pareto distribution. In\naddition, we examine the performance between\nusers with different data rates. Due to the space\nlimitation, an indicative and persuasive scenario is\nselected to discuss the simulation outcomes as:\n\u2022 S-CCPCH 1 carries streaming FACH 2 and\n3 with data rates of 256 kb\/s and 64 kb\/s,\nrespectively, and hot download FACH 1\nwith a data rate of 64 kb\/s.\n\u2022 S-CCPCH 2 carries streaming FACH 4 and\n5 with data rates of 256 kb\/s and 128 kb\/s,\nrespectively.\n\u2022 S-CCPCH 3 carries cold download FACH 6\nwith a data rate of 384 kb\/s.\nSYSTEM PERFORMANCE RESULTS\nQueuing Delay Evaluation \u2014 First, the mean\nqueuing delay experienced by packets in each\nFACH queue at the RLC buffer is investigated.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 5, downloaded multimedia\nservices experience much less mean queuing delay\nin CDRD than in MLPQ, while the mean delays\nexperienced by streaming services feature similar\nperformance. It can be inferred that the significant\nreduction on the delay of the lower QoS class\ndoes not pose significant performance degradation\non its higher QoS class counterpart, that is, the\nQoS of streaming can be guaranteed. The cumula-\ntive distribution function (CDF) of queuing delays\nfor the respective streaming FACH verifies that\nCDRD achieved better queuing delay distribution\nthan MLPQ for all the streaming FACH.\nn Figure 4.

The simulation results\nprove that the CDRD achieves much lower\nqueuing jitter for both streaming and download\nservices, which makes it an attractive approach\nfor delivering jitter-sensitive multimedia services.\nAs mentioned previously, the delay threshold\nis an adjustable parameter upon balancing the\nsystem performance. Simulation results prove\nthat a more stringent delay threshold leads to\nbetter performance for the corresponding QoS\ntraffic class and causes longer delays for the oth-\ners. It is worth mentioning that the JPF function\nemploys multiple performance criteria for deter-\nmining the traffic serving priority that effectively\nprevents queues with performance degradation\non a single profile from gaining extra unneces-\nsary resources. In the case that a flow experi-\nences instantaneous extra burst traffic, the\nincrease on its queue length may lead to its queu-\ning delay out of profile. However, extra incoming\ntraffic can also lead to instantaneous increase on\nthe transmitted data rate, which effectively influ-\nences its serving priority and prevents the queue\nfrom obtaining unnecessary additional resources.\nPhysical Channel Utilization Evaluation \u2014\nFigure 6 depicts the instantaneous physical chan-\nnel utilization achieved for different scheduling\nand rate matching schemes during a sample sim-\nulation period. On the one hand, the total chan-\nnel utilization achieved by CDRD enjoys\nremarkable improvement, compared with MLPQ.\nOn the other hand, by effectively utilizing wasted\nresources via minimizing the unnecessary punc-\nturing and repetition, the DRM-based resource\nallocation outperforms its SRM-based counter-\npart with a significant performance gap.\nIt is noteworthy that the heterogeneity of traf-\nfic mixture in an S-CCPCH can have an essential\nimpact on the physical channel utilization. It is\nshown that the performance gain in the S-CCPCH\nchannel utilization is higher in a more heteroge-\nneous traffic mix scenario (e.g., S-CCPCH 1) than\nthose in other relatively simple scenarios (e.g., S-\nCCPCH 2 and 3). Therefore, this proves that the\nproposed algorithm is capable of offering a higher\nresource utilization score when the traffic mix in\nthe S-CCPCH becomes more heterogeneous.\nNote that the impact of TTI variation on the\nperformance of the proposed scheduling mecha-\nnism is two-fold. On the one hand, the simulation\nresults proved that a higher TTI setting improves\nthe system performance on the throughput and\nchannel utilization. On the other hand, we found\nthat a lower TTI setting is capable of providing\nhigher sensitivity for capturing the traffic dynamics.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this article, we propose a cross-layer packet\nscheduling scheme for multimedia delivery in the\nS-DMB system. This scheme not only takes into\naccount the impact of key performance factors\nreflecting service QoS demands and queuing\ndynamics, but also utilizes a DRM technique at\nthe physical layer to maximize spectrum efficien-\ncy and resource utilization. Simulation was con-\nducted over extensive scenarios for various\nperformance metrics. Results show that the pro-\nposed packet scheduling scheme achieves better\nn Figure 5.
