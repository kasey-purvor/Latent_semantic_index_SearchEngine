De-\ncoupled, rotational sequences built on a single \u03bdh 11\n2\norbital\nare observed in all N = 57 isotones from 9942Mo up to 10952 Te\n[1\u20137] with associated weakly deformed, prolate shapes. At\nmedium spins, these single-quasiparticle rotational bands are\ncrossed by multi-quasiparticle configurations, which have\nbeen interpreted in the framework of the Cranked Shell Model\nto be associated with either \u03bdh 11\n2\n\u2297 \u03c0 (g 9\n2\n)2, \u03bdh 11\n2\n\u2297 \u03bd(g 7\n2\n)2, or\n\u03bdh 11\n2\n\u2297 \u03bd(h 11\n2\n)2 configurations, depending on the proton num-\nber and the associated core deformation [1\u20133]. These collective\nrotational bands can compete with single-particle excitations\nformed by the favored, maximally aligned couplings of high-j\nproton (g 9\n2\n) and neutron (h 11\n2\nand g 7\n2\n) orbitals. This Brief\nReport describes the identification of a high-spin isomeric state\nthat feeds the previously reported h 11\n2\ndecoupled-rotational\nstructure, at I\u03c0 = 232\n\u2212\n, in 99Mo [1].\nThe experiment was performed at Argonne National Labo-\nratory using the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System\n(ATLAS), which delivered a 178Hf beam at a laboratory energy\nof 1150 MeV, with an average beam intensity of 2 particle nA.\nThe main experimental focus was to study long-lived isomers\nin hafnium-like nuclei, using deep-inelastic reactions with a\nthick 208Pb target; the results from this work are reported in\nRef. [8]. The data on 99Mo described in this Brief Report were\nobtained from incidental fusion-fission reactions between the\n178Hf projectiles and the 27Al support frame for the 208Pb\ntarget. Nuclei synthesized in fusion-fission reactions were\nidentified as such from the observation of \u03b3 rays associated\nwith the decay of binary products, consistent with the fission\nof the 178Hf + 27Al fusion-compound nucleus. The beam\n*Corresponding author: G.Jones@Surrey.ac.uk\ndelivered by the ATLAS was bunched into short pulses of width\n\u223c0.5 ns, separated by periods of 82.5 ns. This pulsing was\nutilized to study metastable states in the 10\u22129 < T1\/2 < 10\u22124\ns range; nine out of ten beam pulses were swept away from the\ntarget, resulting in a 825 ns period within which delayed \u03b3 -ray\ndecays could be studied. Events where two or more coincident\n\u03b3 rays were detected within a 2\u00b5s range were written to tape\nfor subsequent off-line analysis. A total of 2.1 \u00d7 109 events\nwere recorded over the course of a 5-day experiment.\nThe nature of the fusion-fission reaction process leads to\nthe detection of a plethora of \u03b3 rays emitted from excited\nstates in a broad range of nuclei, resulting in a highly complex\ndata set. The \u03b3 -ray decays from all the reaction products were\nmeasured using the Gammasphere [9] array, comprised of 101\nCompton-suppressed germanium detectors in this experiment.\nBecause of this level of complexity it was necessary to utilize\nmultidimensional \u03b3 -ray coincidence techniques to correlate\n\u03b3 -ray decays associated with particular nuclides. A variety of\ncoincidence cubes corresponding to different \u03b3 -ray time and\nenergy conditions were created; Table I provides details of\ncubes created, which are relevant to this report. These were\nanalyzed with standard software packages described in Refs.\n[10\u201312].\nA high-spin isomer in 99Mo has been observed for the\nfirst time using these data. Figure 1 provides a level scheme\nof transitions in 99Mo deduced from the current work. The\nisomeric state at Ex = 3010 keV is observed to decay directly\ninto the negative-parity sequence, reported in Ref. [1], by the\nemission of a 305 keV transition to the I\u03c0 = 232\n\u2212\nmember of\nthe decoupled rotational band. Figure 2(a) shows the promptly\nfed decays of the negative-parity band in 99Mo; the 980 and\n1064 keV transitions are observed from the previously reported\nI\u03c0 = ( 272\n\u2212) and ( 312\n\u2212) states, respectively. Figure 2(b) shows\ndelayed transitions associated with double gates in 99Mo.\nThis spectrum clearly identifies the 482, 693, and 846 keV\ntransitions associated with decays from the I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\n, 192\n\u2212\n,\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(4)\/047303(4) 047303-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 047303 (2007)\nTABLE I.

Prompt and delayed\n\u03b3 rays (\u03b3p and \u03b3d , respectively) are defined by the time difference,\nTDp or d , between the \u03b3 -ray, T , and that of the beam, RF.

A previously unreported 305 keV transition is apparent\nin this spectrum; it is interpreted as the direct decay from an\nisomeric state at Ex = 3010 keV. No transition from the isomer\nto the I\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\nstate was observed in this experiment. This is\nconsistent with intensity measurements for delayed transitions\nbelow the isomer, which indicate 100% feeding through the\n305 keV decay.\nThe spectrum shown in Fig. 2(c) illustrates promptly fed\n\u03b3 rays above the Ex = 3010 keV state, using double gates on\ndelayed transitions (see Table I). A weak 1739 keV transition is\nobserved in this spectrum, which fits energetically with a decay\nfrom the Ex = 4749 keV, I\u03c0 = ( 312\n\u2212) state to the isomeric\nlevel. Table II shows Weiskopff estimates of the 1739 keV\ntransition for different multipolarities. For this transition to\ncompete with the collective-E2, 1064 keV \u03b3 ray, one would\nexpect it to decay between states with |Ii \u2212 If | = \u0004L\u0002 2. The\n1739 keV transition is placed tentatively in the level scheme\nprovided in Fig. 1. Other \u03b3 -ray photopeaks at 685, 764, and\n842 keV are identified in this spectrum, associated with prompt\ntransitions that possibly populate the isomeric state. Because\nof the complexity of the data set, particularly with \u03b3 rays\nof energy E\u03b3 < 1 MeV, these transitions could not be linked\nconfidently to the decay of specific states above the Ex =\n3010 keV isomer in 99Mo.\n1\/2\n5\/2\n7\/2 235.5\n11\/2 684.5\n15\/2 1166.3\n19\/2 1859.4\n23\/2 2705.4\n(27\/2 ) 3010.3\n(27\/2 ) 3685\n(31\/2 ) 4749\n97.8\n137.7\n449.0\n481.8\n693.1\n845.9\n304.9\n980\n1064\n(1739)\n0.76 s\n8(2) ns\n15.5 s\nFIG. 1. Partial level scheme for transitions observed in 99Mo.\nArrow widths provide an indication of the relative strengths of\ndifferent \u03b3 -ray decay paths. The \u03b3 -ray energies from states with\nE < 3685 keV have an error of 0.3 keV; the 980, 1064, and 1739 keV\n\u03b3 rays are accurate to 1 keV.\nFigure 2(d) provides a \u03b3 -ray time spectrum of the double-\ngated delayed transitions from the isomeric Ex = 3010 keV\nstate. Relative to the accelerator RF signal, the half-life of the\ndecay is measured as T1\/2 = 8(2) ns, using a folded Gaussian\nplus exponential fit.\nThe spin-parity assignment for this previously unreported\nstate is based on (i) the observed decay to the I\u03c0 = 232\n\u2212\nmember of the negative-parity collective sequence in 99Mo; (ii)\nthe measured lifetime associated with the 305 keV decaying\ntransition; and (iii) the tentatively observed 1739 keV, \u0004L\u0002 2\ntransition that links the Ex = 4748 keV state with the Ex =\n3010 keV isomer.\nWeisskopf single-particle transition rates for a 305 keV\ntransition with E1 or M1 multipolarity are B(E1) = (1.4 \u00b1\n0.4) \u00d7 10\u22126 W.u. or B(M1) = (9.6 \u00b1 2.4) \u00d7 10\u22124 W.u., re-\nspectively.

The \u03b3 rays in (c) illustrate candidates for transitions\ndecaying from states above the Ex = 3010 keV isomer. Panel\n(d) gives the time evolution of the isomeric decay, including a folded\nGaussian plus exponential fit; the dashed line is the prompt Gaussian\nused in the fit (with FWHM = 12.5(10) ns), obtained from a fit to a\nprompt \u03b3 ray with E\u03b3 \u223c 300 keV. Contaminants (97Mo and 178Hf)\nare indicated in each spectrum where applicable.\nhowever, Endt [13] shows that E1 transitions in this region\ncan be hindered to this magnitude. Examples of such hindered\nE1 transitions can also be seen in Ref. [14]. An E1, 305 keV\ntransition would imply I\u03c0 = 232\n+\nor 252\n+ for the isomer. Under\nsuch circumstances, one might expect to observe a 1152 keV\ntransition from the isomer to the I\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\nstate; Weiskopff\nestimates in Table II indicate that a 1152 keV, M2 or E3\ntransition is likely to compete with the E1, 305 keV decay.\nThe fact that no competing E\u03b3 = 1152 keV decay is observed\nto the I\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212 (or lower spin) member of the negative-parity\nsequence suggests that the spin of the isomeric state is at least\nI = 252 .\nA stretched-E2, 305 keV transition provides I\u03c0 = 272\n\u2212\nspin-parity assignment for the Ex = 3010 keV state, cor-\nresponding to a Weisskopf single-particle transition rate of\nB(E2) = 0.96(24) W.u. Weiskopff estimates for the 1739 keV\ntransition are also consistent with a I\u03c0 = 272\n\u2212\nassignment for\nthe isomer. On the basis of these arguments, we suggest an\nE2 assignment for the 305 keV transition and thus a tentative\nI\u03c0 = ( 272\n\u2212) spin-parity assignment for the isomeric state.\nAn I\u03c0 = 212\n+ isomeric state in the N = 57 isotone 10548 Cd\nhas a reported configuration of \u03bdd 5\n2\n\u2297 \u03c0 (g 9\n2\n)\u22122, as deduced\nTABLE III.

The analo-\ngous maximally aligned coupling of the (g 9\n2\n)2 protons with\n\u03bdd 5\n2\n, \u03bdg 7\n2\n, and \u03bdh 11\n2\nwould be expected to form energetically\nfavored multiparticle states in 99Mo with I\u03c0 = 212\n+\n, 232\n+\n,\nand 272\n\u2212\n, respectively. A simple estimate for the excitation\nenergies of such states can be made with Ex = [\u03b5i + 2\u0004p],\nassuming no residual interactions. The single-quasiparticle\nenergy, \u03b5i , is taken from the low-lying single-quasiparticle\nstates in 99Mo; the proton-pair gap, \u0004p = 2.12 MeV, is\nestimated using an empirical mass formula [16] with binding\nenergies taken from Ref. [17]. An empirical comparison of\nthe proton-pair gap shows that the estimate is accurate to\nwithin a few hundred keV; the excitation energy of the aligned\n\u03bdd 5\n2\n\u2297 \u03c0 (g 9\n2\n)2, I \u03c0 = 212\n\u2212\nstate in 93Mo is Ex = 2.4 MeV.\nTable III shows the energy estimates for the expected I\u03c0 =\n21\n2\n+\n, 232\n+\n, and 272\n\u2212\nstates associated with the simple (d 5\n2\n), (g 7\n2\n),\nor (h 11\n2\n) neutron, coupling to the maximally aligned \u03c0 (g 9\n2\n)2\nconfiguration. The calculated state energy for the maximally\naligned \u03bdh 11\n2\n\u2297 \u03c0 (g 9\n2\n)2 configuration appears to be within 200\nkeV of the observed isomeric-state energy. The experimentally\nsuggested spin-parity for the isomer is also consistent with this\nassessment.\nThis interpretation assumes a spherical shape; however,\npreliminary potential-energy-surface calculations [18], which\nfollow the prescription of those presented in Ref. [19], indicate\na shallow oblate-triaxial minimum for the isomeric state.\nWhilst the spherical pairing estimate offers an impressive\ncorrelation with experimental data, a deformed shape for the\nisomeric state could be a possibility. In the absence of further\ndata on the isomeric state and\/or the observation of collective\nstates associated with its configuration, it is not possible to\nmake a firm conclusion in this respect. Nevertheless, this\nlow-lying spherical or oblate-triaxial isomer is distinct from\nthe prolate-triaxial structure of the \u03bdh 11\n2\nband, which undergoes\na bandcrossing at higher spin [1] and forms a rotation-aligned\n\u03bdh 11\n2\n\u2297 \u03c0 (g 9\n2\n)2 sequence.\nIn summary, a previously unidentified isomeric state in\n99Mo has been reported here for the first time. The isomer\nwas identified from the study of \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy in a\npulsed-beam experiment. Using systematic arguments and a\nsimple pairing estimate, the state is interpreted as a maximally\naligned \u03bdh 11\n2\n\u2297 \u03c0 (g 9\n2\n)2 configuration.\nThis work is supported by the U.S. Department of\nEnergy, Office of Nuclear Physics, under Contract DE-\nAC02-06CH11357 (A.N.L.); the U.S. AFOSR under Contract\nF49620-02-1-0187; the AWE (U.K.); and the EPSRC (U.K.).\n047303-3\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 047303 (2007)\n[1] P.
