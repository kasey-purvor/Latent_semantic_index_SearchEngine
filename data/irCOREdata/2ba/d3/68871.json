INTRODUCTION\nSoon after the fabrication of individual graphene flakes\na few years ago [1], it was realized that low-energy quasi-\nparticles in graphene are chiral, with a linear dispersion\nand degree of chirality characterized by Berry\u2019s phase \u03c0\nin monolayer graphene [2, 3] and quadratic dispersion re-\nlated to Berry\u2019s phase 2\u03c0 in bilayers [4, 5]. In addition to\ntheir degree of chirality, bilayers are distinguished from\nmonolayers by the possibility of using doping or exter-\nnal gates to induce interlayer asymmetry that opens a\ntunable gap between the conduction and valence bands\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], as observed in transport [12, 13]\nand spectroscopic measurements [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].\nRecently, there has been experimental interest in the\ntransport properties of trilayer graphene [20, 21, 22].\nIt is expected that two different types of stacking or-\nder, ABA and ABC (illustrated in Fig. 1), will be real-\nized in nature and that electronic properties will depend\nstrongly on the stacking type. For ABA-stacked trilayer\ngraphene, the low-energy electronic band structure con-\nsists of separate monolayer-like and bilayer-like bands\n[6, 7, 10, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] that become hybridized in the\npresence of interlayer asymmetry [7, 26]. By contrast, the\nlow-energy bands of ABC-stacked trilayers [7, 10, 23, 28]\ndo not resemble those of monolayers or bilayers, but ap-\npear to be a cubic generalization of them. Thus, there is\na cubic dispersion relation and chirality related to Berry\u2019s\nphase 3\u03c0 [7, 29, 30], and, as in bilayers, the application\nof interlayer asymmetry is predicted to open an energy\ngap in the spectrum [7, 10].\nIn this paper, we show that the low-energy band struc-\nture of ABC-stacked multilayer graphene is not just a\nstraightforward generalization of that of monolayers and\nbilayers. We focus on a particular aspect of the band\nstructure, trigonal warping, which plays a crucial role in\nthe low-energy band structure. Trigonal warping is a de-\nformation of the Fermi circle around a degeneracy point\n[31], at each of two inequivalent corners of the hexagonal\nBrillouin zone that are known asK points [32] [Fig. 1(b)].\nIn bilayer graphene, trigonal warping is enhanced by the\ninterlayer coupling and leads to a Lifshitz transition [33]\nwhen the Fermi line about each K point is broken into\nseveral pockets [5, 24, 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Here, we de-\nvelop an effective Hamiltonian for ABC-stacked trilayer\ngraphene, to show that trigonal warping in it is both\nqualitatively and quantitatively different from that in bi-\nlayers. The main contribution to trigonal warping arises\nfrom a different type of interlayer coupling that is miss-\ning in bilayers and we predict that it leads to a Lifshitz\ntransition at a much larger energy \u223c 10meV, which is 10\ntimes as large as in a bilayer. Moreover, on undergoing\nthe Lifshitz transition, the Fermi surface breaks into a\ndifferent number of pockets reflecting Berry\u2019s phase 3\u03c0\nin contrast to 2\u03c0 in bilayers. Here, we also generalize our\napproach to describe trigonal warping in general ABC-\nstackedN -layer graphene, to show that Berry\u2019s phaseN\u03c0\nmanifests itself in different characteristics of the Lifshitz\ntransition.\nIn the next Section, we describe the effective mass\nmodel of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene and the result-\ning band structure. Then, in Section III, we derive an\neffective low-energy Hamiltonian and we use it to com-\npare the behavior of low-energy chiral quasiparticles in\ntrilayers with those in monolayer and bilayer graphene.\nIn Section IV, we provide an approximate analytical de-\nscription of the Lifshitz transition in the absence and in\nthe presence of interlayer asymmetry that opens a gap\nin the spectrum. Section V describes the manifestation\nof the Lifshitz transition in the degeneracy of Landau\nlevels in the presence of a finite magnetic field. In Sec-\ntion VI, we generalize our approach to ABC-stacked N -\nlayer graphene. Throughout, we compare the approxi-\nmate description of the effective low-energy Hamiltonian\nwith numerical diagonalization of the full effective mass\nmodel.\n2FIG. 1: (a) Schematic of the ABC-stacked trilayer lattice\ncontaining six sites in the unit cell, A (white circles) and B\n(black circles) on each layer, showing the Slonczewski-Weiss-\nMcClure parameterization [39] of relevant couplings \u03b30 to \u03b34.\n(b) Schematic of the hexagonal Brillouin zone with two in-\nequivalent valleys K\u00b1 showing the momentum p measured\nfrom the center of valley K+. Schematic of the unit cell of\n(c) ABC-stacked trilayer graphene, (d) ABA-stacked trilayer\ngraphene, and (e) bilayer graphene. In (c), \u03b32 describes a\nvertical coupling between sites B3 and A1 in different unit\ncells.\nII. THE EFFECTIVE MASS MODEL OF\nABC-STACKED TRILAYER GRAPHENE\nThe lattice of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene consists\nof three coupled layers, each with carbon atoms arranged\non a honeycomb lattice, including pairs of inequivalent\nsites {A1, B1}, {A2, B2}, and {A3, B3} in the bottom,\ncenter, and top layers, respectively. The layers are ar-\nranged as shown in Fig. 1(a,c), such that pairs of sites\nB1 and A2, and B2 and A3, lie directly above or below\neach other [for comparison, the unit cell of ABA-stacked\ngraphene is shown in Fig. 1(d)]. In order to write down\nan effective mass Hamiltonian, we adapt the Slonczewski-\nWeiss-McClure parameterization of tight-binding cou-\nplings of bulk graphite [39]. Nearest-neighbor (Ai-Bi for\ni = {1, 2, 3}) coupling within each layer is described by\nparameter \u03b30, \u03b31 describes strong nearest-layer coupling\nbetween sites (B1-A2 and B2-A3) that lie directly above\nor below each other, \u03b33 (\u03b34) describes weaker nearest-\nlayer coupling between sites A1-B2 and A2-B3 (A1-A2,\nB1-B2, A2-A3, and B2-B3). With only these couplings,\nthere would be a degeneracy point at each of two in-\nequivalent corners, K\u00b1, of the hexagonal Brillouin zone\n[32] but this degeneracy is broken by next-nearest-layer\ncoupling \u03b32, between sites A1 and B3 that lie on the\nsame vertical line [10, 23, 28]. For typical values of bulk\nABA graphite we quote [39] \u03b30 = 3.16eV, \u03b31 = 0.39eV,\n\u03b32 = \u22120.020eV, \u03b33 = 0.315eV and \u03b34 = 0.044eV. Al-\nthough the atomic structures of ABA and ABC (rhom-\nbohedral) graphite are different, we refer to those values\nin the following numerical calculations, assuming that\nthe corresponding coupling parameters have similar val-\nues [40].\nIn a basis with atomic components \u03c8A1, \u03c8B1, \u03c8A2,\n\u03c8B2, \u03c8A3, \u03c8B3, the ABC-stacked trilayer Hamiltonian\n[7, 28, 40, 41] is\nH\u02c6ABC =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edD1 V WV \u2020 D2 V\nW \u2020 V \u2020 D3\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (1)\nwhere the 2\u00d7 2 blocks are\nDi =\n(\nUi v\u03c0\n\u2020\nv\u03c0 Ui\n)\n(i = 1, 2, 3), (2)\nV =\n(\u2212v4\u03c0\u2020 v3\u03c0\n\u03b31 \u2212v4\u03c0\u2020\n)\n, W =\n(\n0 \u03b32\/2\n0 0\n)\n, (3)\nwhere v = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b30\/~, v3 = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b33\/~, v4 =\n(\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b34\/~, \u03c0 = \u03bepx+ ipy, \u03c0\n\u2020 = \u03bepx\u2212 ipy, and \u03be = \u00b11\nis the valley index. Here p = (px, py) = p(cos\u03c6, sin\u03c6) is\nthe momentum measured with respect to the center of\nthe valley [Fig. 1(b)]. The parameters U1, U2, and U3\ndescribe on-site energies of the atoms on the three layers\nthat may be different owing the presence of substrates,\ndoping, or external gates. In the following, we set the\naverage on-site energy to zero U1 + U2 + U3 = 0 and\nwrite differences between the on-site energies in terms of\nasymmetry parameters \u22061 and \u22062 [26],\n\u22061 = (U1 \u2212 U3) \/2 ,\n\u22062 = (U1 \u2212 2U2 + U3) \/6 .\nParameter \u22061 describes a possible asymmetry between\nthe energies of the outer layers, whereas \u22062 takes into\naccount the possibility that the energy of the central layer\nmay differ from the average outer layer energy.\nAs there are six atoms in the unit cell, ABC-stacked\ntrilayer graphene has six electronic bands at low en-\nergy as plotted in Fig. 2. For no interlayer asymme-\ntry \u22061 = \u22062 = 0, and exactly at the K point, p = 0,\nthe eigenvalues \u01eb of Hamiltonian Eq. (1) are given by\n(\u01eb2 \u2212 \u03b321)2(\u01eb2 \u2212 \u03b322\/4) = 0. Four of the bands are split\naway from zero energy by interlayer coupling \u03b31 (\u01eb = \u00b1\u03b31\ntwice). These high-energy bands correspond to dimer\nstates formed primarily from orbitals on the atomic sites\nB1, A2, B2, and A3 that are strongly coupled by \u03b31.\nThe other two bands (\u01eb = \u00b1\u03b32\/2) are split slightly away\nfrom zero energy by next-nearest layer coupling \u03b32\/2 that\nconnects atomic sites A1 and B3 [10, 23, 28].\nFigure 2 shows the band structure at several \u22061\u2019s with\n\u22062 = 0, using the parameter values quoted above. \u22061\nopens an energy gap between the lower electron and hole\nbands, because of the energy difference between A1 and\n3FIG. 2: Band dispersion of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene\nin the vicinity of K+ along px axis.

Figure 3 shows contour plots of the lower\nelectron band at (a) \u22061\/\u03b31 = 0 and (b) 0.4, showing that\nthe band is trigonally warped, and the contour splits into\nthree pockets at low energy. The detailed band structure\nand its relation to the band parameters will be studied\nin the following sections.\nIII. THE LOW-ENERGY EFFECTIVE\nHAMILTONIAN\nTo describe the low-energy electronic properties of\nABC-stacked trilayer graphene it is useful to derive an\neffective two-component Hamiltonian that describes hop-\nping between atomic sites A1 and B3. Such a procedure\nhas been applied to bilayer graphene [5] and to ABC-\nstacked trilayer graphene [7] for \u03b33 = \u03b32 = \u22062 = 0. We\nbegin with the energy eigenvalue equation H\u03a8 = \u01eb\u03a8 of\nthe six-component Hamiltonian, Eq. (1), eliminate the\ndimer components \u03c7 = (\u03c8B1, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B2, \u03c8A3)\nT and, then,\nsimplify the expressions for low-energy components \u03b8 =\n(\u03c8A1, \u03c8B3)\nT\nby treating interlayer coupling \u03b31 as a large\nenergy scale |\u01eb|, vp, |\u03b32|, |\u03b33|, |\u03b34|, |\u22061|, |\u22062| \u226a \u03b31. We de-\nnote h\u03b8 as the diagonal block of Hamiltonian of Eq. (1)\ncorresponding to \u03b8, h\u03c7 as the four by four diagonal block\ncorresponding to \u03c7, and u as the off-diagonal 2\u00d7 4 block\ncoupling \u03b8 and \u03c7. The Schro\u00a8dinger equation for \u03b8 can be\nexpanded up to first order in \u01eb as [h\u03b8 \u2212 uh\u22121\u03c7 u\u2020]\u03b8 = \u01ebS\u03b8\nwith S \u2261 1+uh\u22122\u03c7 u\u2020. Then, the effective Hamiltonian for\n\u03b8\u02dc = S1\/2\u03b8 becomes H(eff) \u2248 S\u22121\/2[h\u03b8 \u2212 uh\u22121\u03c7 u\u2020]S\u22121\/2.\nThus, we find the following two-component Hamilto-\nFIG. 3: (a) Equi-energy contour plots of the lowest electron\nband of ABC trilayer graphene at (a) \u22061 = 0 and (b) 0.4\u03b31.\nNumbers on the contours indicate energy in units of \u03b31. Filled\nand empty triangles represent local minima and maxima, re-\nspectively, of the energy band.\nnian in a basis of the A1-B3 sites:\nH\u02c6\n(eff)\nABC = H\u02c63 + H\u02c63w + H\u02c63c + H\u02c6\u22061 + H\u02c6\u22062, (4)\nH\u02c63 =\nv3\n\u03b321\n(\n0\n(\n\u03c0\u2020\n)3\n\u03c03 0\n)\n,\nH\u02c63w =\n(\n\u22122vv3p\n2\n\u03b31\n+\n\u03b32\n2\n)(\n0 1\n1 0\n)\n,\nH\u02c63c =\n2vv4p\n2\n\u03b321\n(\n1 0\n0 1\n)\n.\nH\u02c6\u22061 = \u22061\n(\n1\u2212 v\n2p2\n\u03b321\n)(\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n)\n,\nH\u02c6\u22062 = \u22062\n(\n1\u2212 3v\n2p2\n\u03b321\n)(\n1 0\n0 1\n)\n.\nHere we keep only the leading order for the terms includ-\ning \u03b32, v3 and v4. Terms H\u02c63 and H\u02c6\u22061 were derived in\nRef. [7]. The cubic term H\u02c63 describes effective hopping\nbetween sites A1 and B3 via the other sites on the lattice\n4that are strongly coupled by \u03b31. Taken on its own, it pro-\nduces a dispersion \u01eb = \u00b1v3p3\/\u03b321 . H\u02c63w arises from the\nskewed interlayer coupling \u03b33 and the next-nearest inter-\nlayer coupling \u03b32, and is responsible for trigonal warping\nas discussed in detail later. H\u02c63c, coming from another\ninterlayer coupling \u03b34, gives an identical curvature to the\nelectron and hole bands and thus introduces electron-\nhole asymmetry. Terms H\u02c6\u22061, H\u02c6\u22062 arise from the inter-\nlayer asymmetries \u22061 and \u22062, respectively. H\u02c6\u22061 leads\nto the opening of an energy gap between the conduc-\ntion and valence bands, while H\u02c6\u22062 produces electron-\nhole asymmetry in a similar way as H\u02c63c. In the two-\ncomponent basis of H\u02c6\n(eff)\nABC , time reversal is described by\nH\u02c6\u2217 (p,\u22061, \u03be) = H\u02c6 (\u2212p,\u22061,\u2212\u03be) and spatial inversion by\n\u03c3xH\u02c6 (p,\u22061, \u03be)\u03c3x = H\u02c6 (\u2212p,\u2212\u22061,\u2212\u03be). Manes et al [29]\nshowed that the Fermi points of ABC-stacked multilayers\nare stable with respect to the opening of a gap against\nperturbations that respect combined time reversal and\nspatial inversion, as well as translation invariance.\nThe low-energy effective Hamiltonian for ABC-stacked\ntrilayer graphene bears some resemblance to that of bi-\nlayer graphene [5]. In the lattice of bilayer graphene,\nFig. 1(e), two of the sites (B1 and A2) are directly above\nor below each other and are strongly coupled by inter-\nlayer coupling \u03b31 whereas two sites (A1 and B2) do not\nhave a counterpart in the other layer. The low-energy\nHamiltonian is written in a basis (\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2) of these two\nsites:\nH\u02c6\n(eff)\nAB = H\u02c62 + H\u02c62w + H\u02c6\u2206, (5)\nH\u02c62 = \u2212v\n2\n\u03b31\n(\n0\n(\n\u03c0\u2020\n)2\n\u03c02 0\n)\n,\nH\u02c62w = v3\n(\n0 \u03c0\n\u03c0\u2020 0\n)\n,\nH\u02c62c =\n2vv4p\n2\n\u03b321\n(\n1 0\n0 1\n)\n,\nH\u02c6\u2206 = \u2206\n(\n1\u2212 2v\n2p2\n\u03b321\n)(\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n)\n,\nwhere parameter \u2206 describes interlayer asymmetry be-\ntween on-site energy \u2206 of the atoms, A1 and B1, on\nthe first layer and \u2212\u2206 of the atoms, A2 and B2, on the\nsecond layer.\nThe first term in each Hamiltonian, H\u02c62 for bilayers,\nEq. (5), and H\u02c63 for ABC-stacked trilayers, Eq. (4), are\nmembers of a family of Hamiltonians H\u02c6J = F (p)\u03c3 \u00b7 n\nwhere n = lx cos(J\u03be\u03c6)+ly sin(J\u03be\u03c6) for p = p(cos\u03c6, sin \u03c6)\n[5, 7, 29, 30]. They describe chiral quasiparticles, and\nthe degree of chirality is J = 1 in monolayer graphene,\nJ = 2 in a bilayer, and, here, J = 3 in ABC-stacked\ntrilayer. Quasiparticles described by the Hamiltonians\nH\u02c6J acquire a Berry\u2019s phase \u2212i\n\u222e\nC\ndp \u00b7 \u3008\u03a8|\u2207p|\u03a8\u3009 = J\u03be\u03c0,\nupon an adiabatic propagation along an equi-energetic\nline C. Thus charge carriers in ABC-stacked trilayer\ngraphene are Berry\u2019s phase 3\u03be\u03c0 quasiparticles, in con-\ntrast to Berry\u2019s phase \u03be\u03c0 particles in monolayers, 2\u03be\u03c0\nin bilayers. As well as the first term in the Hamilto-\nnian Eq. (4) of ABC-trilayers being a generalization of\nthat in bilayers, the influence of interlayer asymmetry\n\u22061 = (U1\u2212U3)\/2 as described by H\u02c6\u22061 is similar to that\nin bilayers as described by H\u02c6\u2206, Eq. (5).\nIV. TRIGONAL WARPING AND THE\nLIFSHITZ TRANSITION\nIn a similar way to bulk graphite [39], the parameter \u03b33\n[where v3 = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b33\/~] produces trigonal warping in\nbilayer graphene [5], where the equi-energetic line around\neach valley is stretched in three directions. This is due\nto the interference of the matrix elements connecting A1\nand B2, where an electron hopping from A1 to B2 ac-\nquires a factor e2i\u03be\u03c6 in H\u02c62 and e\n\u2212i\u03be\u03c6 in H\u02c62w. We neglect\nthe terms including v4 which add a term \u221d p2 to the en-\nergy but don\u2019t contribute to trigonal warping. At \u2206 = 0,\nthe eigenenergy of Eq. (5) is given by\n\u01eb \u2248 \u00b1\n\u221a\nv23p\n2 \u2212 2\u03be v3v\n2p3\n\u03b31\ncos 3\u03c6+\nv4p4\n\u03b321\n. (6)\nThe warping has a dramatic effect when H\u02c62 and H\u02c62w\nhave comparable amplitudes, i.e., v2p2\/\u03b31 \u223c v3p, which\nis satisfied at p \u223c p0 = \u03b31v3\/v2. It leads to a Lifshitz\ntransition [5, 24, 29, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], in which the\nequi-energetic line is broken into four separate pockets.\nThere is one central pocket located around p = 0 and,\nthree \u201cleg\u201d pockets centered at momentum of magnitude\np = p0 and angle \u03c60 = 2n\u03c0\/3 + (1 \u2212 \u03be)\u03c0\/6. The Fermi\npocket separation occurs at energy \u01ebL = (v3\/v)\n2\u03b31\/4,\nwhich is estimated to be \u01ebL \u223c 1meV.\nIn ABC-stacked trilayer graphene, there is a similar,\nbut much greater warping effect. In hopping from A1 to\nB3, an electron acquires a factor e3i\u03be\u03c6 from H\u02c63 and a\nfactor of unity from H\u02c63w, giving trigonal symmetry in \u03c6.\nAt \u22061 = \u22062 = 0, the eigenenergy of Eq. (4) reads,\n\u01eb \u2248 \u00b1\n\u221a\nf(p)2 + 2\u03bef(p) g(p) cos 3\u03c6+ g(p)\n2\n, (7)\nwhere f(p) = v3p3\/\u03b321 comes from H\u02c63 and g(p) =\n\u22122vv3p2\/\u03b31 + \u03b32\/2 from H\u02c63w. Similarly to the bilayer,\nthe warping effect is prominent when |g(p)| \u223c f(p), or\np \u223c p0 with vp0\/\u03b31 \u2261 [\u03b32\/(2\u03b31)]1\/3 \u2212 (v3\/v)\/3. This es-\ntimate is valid as long as |v3\/v|<\u223c|\u03b32\/\u03b31|1\/3, which holds\nfor typical parameter values of bulk graphite [39].\nThe major difference from the bilayer is the contribu-\ntion of the parameter \u03b32\/2, which appears in the Hamil-\ntonian without an accompanying momentum-dependent\nfactor and, thus, it doesn\u2019t vanish at p = 0. Such trigonal\nwarping produces a Lifshitz transition at low energy, but,\nunlike bilayers, it occurs at energy \u01ebL \u2248 |\u03b32\/2|. Although\nthe value of \u03b32 in ABC-trilayer graphene has not been\nmeasured experimentally, comparison with similar cou-\nplings in bulk graphite [39] suggest that |\u03b32| \u223c 20meV.\n5This opens up the possibility that the Lifshitz transi-\ntion in ABC-trilayer graphene could occur at a much\nhigher energy than that in bilayers. At energy lower than\n|\u03b32|\/2, the contour splits into three leg pockets centered\nat p \u223c p0 in a trigonal manner. Unlike bilayer graphene,\nthe central pocket is missing because H\u02c6\u03b32 does not vanish\nat p = 0.\nAn effective Hamiltonian in the vicinity of the leg pock-\nets, for |\u01eb| \u226a \u01ebL, may be obtained by transforming to\nmomentum q = (qx, qy) measured from their centers,\nqx = px cos\u03c60 + py sin\u03c60 \u2212 p0 , (8)\nqy = \u2212px sin\u03c60 + py cos\u03c60 , (9)\nand taking the limit of infinitely large \u03b31:\nH\u02c6 legABC = 3v\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b322\u03b31\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\/3(\n0 \u03be\u03b1qx \u2212 iqy\n\u03be\u03b1qx + iqy 0\n)\n, (10)\nwhere \u03b1 = 1 + (4v3\/3v)(2\u03b31\/\u03b32)\n1\/3. Thus,\nthe pockets are elliptical with dispersion \u01eb \u2248\n\u00b13|\u03b32\/(2\u03b31)|2\/3v\n\u221a\n\u03b12q2x + q\n2\ny. The different nature of the\nLifshitz transition in bilayers and ABC-stacked trilayers\nis a manifestation of Berry\u2019s phase. In trilayer graphene,\nthe geometrical phase integrated around the equi-energy\nline of each pocket is \u03be\u03c0 as in a monolayer, giving 3\u03be\u03c0\nin total. This is different from bilayers, where 3\u03be\u03c0 arises\nfrom three leg pockets and \u2212\u03be\u03c0 from the center pocket\ngives 2\u03be\u03c0 in total [29, 37].\nInterlayer asymmetry \u22061 opens a gap in the spectrum\nand produces a Mexican hat feature in the low-energy\ndispersion. [7] The eigenenergy corresponding to Eq. (4)\nis given by\n\u01eb \u2248 \u00b1\n\u221a\nf(p)2 + 2\u03bef(p) g(p) cos 3\u03c6+ g(p)\n2\n+ h(p)2, (11)\nwith an extra term as compared to Eq. (7), h(p) =\n\u22061(1\u2212v2p2\/\u03b321), coming from H\u02c6\u22061 . For no trigonal warp-\ning [g(p) = 0], it yields \u01eb2 = \u220621(1\u2212 v2p2\/\u03b321)2+ v6p6\/\u03b341 .\nThe energy is \u01eb = \u00b1\u22061 at zero momentum, but there is a\nminima located isotropically about the center of the val-\nley at finite momentum p = p1 \u2248 (2\/3)1\/4\n\u221a|\u22061\u03b31|\/v\n(for |\u22061| \u226a |\u03b31|) at which the energy is \u01eb = \u01eb1 \u2248\n\u00b1\u22061\n(\n1\u2212 (2\/3)3\/2|\u22061\/\u03b31|\n)\n.\nIn the presence of trigonal warping, there is an in-\nterplay between the Mexican hat feature and the Lif-\nshitz transition. In the large gap regime, such that\n|g| \u226a f, h, the circular edge of the band bottom is\ntrigonally distorted by the perturbation of g(p), mak-\ning three pockets on it. The bottom of the pockets\nmoves to momentum p = p1 + \u03b4p1 with v\u03b4p1\/\u03b31 \u2248\n(\n\u221a\n6\/8)[\u03b32\/(2\u22061)] \u2212 (5\/6)(v3\/v), and energy \u01eb = \u01eb1 \u2212\n\u03b4\u01eb1 with \u01eb1 = (2\/3)\n3\/4\n\u221a\n\u22061\/\u03b31\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03b32\/2\u2212\u221a8\/3(v3\/v)\u22061\u2223\u2223\u2223.\nThe area of the pocket in k-space becomes of the order\nof p1\u03b4p1, and the depth in energy is of order \u03b4\u01eb1, both of\nwhich increase as \u22061 increases. This significant enlarge-\nment of the trigonal pockets, in the presence of finite \u22061,\nis illustrated in Figure 3 which is produced by numerical\ndiagonalization of the full Hamiltonian Eq. (1). Note that\nsimilar widening of the pockets by the gap term occurs in\nbilayer graphene as well. This can be understood in an\nanalogous way, by writing f(p) = v2p2\/\u03b31, g(p) = v3p,\nand h(p) = \u2206(1 \u2212 2v2p2\/\u03b321).\nV. LANDAU LEVEL SPECTRUM\nThe energy levels in a magnetic field are given by\nreplacing p with p + eA in the Hamiltonian Eq. (1),\nwhere A(r) is the vector potential corresponding to the\nmagnetic field. Here we consider a uniform magnetic\nfield B applied along +z direction in a Landau gauge\nA = (0, Bx). Operators \u03c0 and \u03c0\u2020 are then related\nto raising and lowering operators a\u2020 and a of the Lan-\ndau level in a conventional two-dimensional system, such\nthat [lB\/(\n\u221a\n2~)]\u03c0\u2020 = a\u2020 and a for K+ and K\u2212, respec-\ntively, with lB =\n\u221a\n~\/(eB). The operator a acts as\na\u03d5n,k =\n\u221a\nn\u03d5n\u22121,k, and a\u03d50 = 0, where \u03d5n,k(x, y) \u221d\neikye\u2212z\n2\/2Hn(z) is the wavefunction of the nth Lan-\ndau level in a conventional two-dimensional system with\nz = (x+ kl2B)\/lB, and Hn being a Hermite polynomial.\nIn the simplest model including only \u03b30 and \u03b31 without\ntrigonal warping, the effective Hamiltonian H\u02c63 in Eq. (4)\nyields the eigenstates for K+ [7]\n\u01ebn = 0, \u03a8nk \u221d\n(\n\u03d5n,k\n0\n)\n(n = 0, 1, 2),\n\u01ebsn = s\n\u22063B\n\u03b321\n\u221a\nn(n\u2212 1)(n\u2212 2)\n\u03a8snk \u221d\n(\n\u03d5n,k\ns\u03d5n\u22123,k\n)\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe (n \u2265 3), (12)\nwhere s = \u00b11 describes the electron and hole levels, re-\nspectively, \u2206B =\n\u221a\n2~v2eB. The eigenstates n = 0, 1, 2\nhave a non-zero amplitude only on the first element (A1),\nand remain at zero energy regardless of the magnetic field\nstrength, while the energy of the other levels behaves as\n\u221d B3\/2. At the other valley K\u2212, there is a similar struc-\nture except that the first and second elements are inter-\nchanged, i.e., the zero-energy Landau levels have ampli-\ntudes only on sites B3 [7].\nTrigonal warping gives a remarkable feature in the\nstructure of Landau levels. In enough small fields,\nthe three leg pockets independently accommodate an\nequal number of Landau levels so that they are triply\ndegenerate. This is in contrast to bilayer graphene\nwhere the central pocket also contributes to the de-\ngeneracy [5]. The low-energy effective Hamiltonian,\nEq. (10), shows that the Landau level energy follows a\nsimilar sequence as that in monolayer graphene, \u01ebn =\n3|\u03b32\/(2\u03b31)|2\/3\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2206Bsgn(n)\n\u221a\nn where n is integer. The\ntotal number of Landau levels accommodated in each\npocket is roughly estimated by the condition \u03b5n \u223c |\u03b32|\/2,\nas n \u223c (\u03b31\/\u2206B)2[\u03b32\/(2\u03b31)]2\/3\/(9\u03b1).\n6Fig. 4(a) shows the Landau level spectrum at the valley\nK+ as a function of \u2206B(\u221d\n\u221a\nB), numerically calculated\nfor the full parameter model Eq. (1) at \u22061 = \u22062 = 0.\nBelow \u01eb = \u03b32\/2, the Landau levels are triply degenerate\nand move in proportion to\n\u221a\nB. The degeneracy of each\nlevel is broken at \u01eb = \u03b32\/2, and it splits into three sepa-\nrate levels, corresponding to coalescence of the leg pock-\nets at the Lifshitz transition. At even higher energy, it\napproaches B3\/2 behavior as described in Eq. (12). The\ntriply degenerate level around zero energy is regarded\nas the n = 0 level in each of three pockets. In actual\nfact, its degeneracy is split slightly in a large magnetic\nfield, owing to magnetic break down among the semi-\nclassical orbits in the leg pockets, which is caused by the\nparameter v4. When the trigonal warping vanishes, those\nthree levels switch to the degenerate levels with indices\nn = 0, 1, 2 in Eq. (12).\nFig. 4(b) shows the Landau level spectrum at K+ as\na function of asymmetry \u22061 with fixed magnetic field\n\u2206B = 0.1\u03b31 (B \u223c 1T). As \u22061 is changed from negative\nto positive, three Landau levels [indicated by the single\ndiagonal line that crosses \u01eb = 0 at \u22061 = 0 in Fig. 4(b)]\nare pumped from the hole side to the electron side. In the\napproximate model of Eq. (12), this corresponds to the\nfact that the energy levels n = 0, 1, 2 have a wave ampli-\ntude only on A1, so that it acquires on-site energy +\u22061\nin the first order of perturbation. At the other valley\nK\u2212, there is the opposite movement, i.e., the three levels\ngo down from positive to negative energies in increasing\n\u22061.\nThe energy of the Lifshitz transition appears as a re-\ngion where the levels are densely populated, and below\nthat energy the levels are triply degenerated [indicated by\nthe shaded region in Fig. 4(b)]. It should be noted that\nthe number of triply-degenerate levels increases for larger\n\u22061, reflecting the enlargement of the trigonal pockets\ndiscussed above. In a measurement of Hall conductivity,\nthose triply-degenerate Landau levels would be observed\nas quantum Hall steps of magnitude 3gvgse\n2\/h, where\ngv = gs = 2 are the valley and spin degeneracies, respec-\ntively.\nVI. GENERAL ABC-STACKED MULTILAYER\nGRAPHENE\nThe analysis of ABC-stacked trilayer graphene can be\nextended to multilayers with N layers. We consider each\nlayer to consist of carbon atoms on a honeycomb lattice,\nand the layers are arranged with ABC stacking. The\nHamiltonian is written in a basis \u03c8A1, \u03c8B1, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B2,\nFIG. 4: Landau levels of ABC trilayer graphene, plotted\nagainst (a) B1\/2 at fixed \u22061 = 0, and (b) \u22061 at fixed mag-\nnetic field (2~v2eB)1\/2 = 0.1\u03b31 (B \u223c 1T). The region in which\nLandau levels are triply degenerate is highlighted by shading.\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c8AN , \u03c8BN , as [40, 41]\nH\u02c6N =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nD1 V W\nV \u2020 D2 V W\nW \u2020 V \u2020 D3\n. . .\n. . .\nW \u2020\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n, (13)\nwhere the 2\u00d72 blocks Di, V ,W are defined in Eqs. (2,3).\nPairs of sites B(i) and A(i+ 1) (i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N \u2212 1) are\nvertically above or below each other, and are strongly\ncoupled by \u03b31 giving dimer states. Thus, all the sites\nin the lattice, except two, contribute to bands that lie\naway from zero energy. The remaining two sites, A1\nand BN , form the lowest-energy electron and hole bands.\n7Note that these sites lie on the outer layers, so that the\nlowest bands are missing in an infinite system with pe-\nriodic boundary conditions applied in the stacking di-\nrection. The band structure has trigonal symmetry for\nany N . This is checked by applying the transformation\n\u03c6\u2192 \u03c6+2\u03c0\/3 to Eq. (13), where the change in the matrix\nelements can be canceled by the gauge transformation\n\u03c8\u02dcAn = \u03b1n\u03c8An and \u03c8\u02dcBn = \u03b1n\u03c8Bn, with \u03b1n = e\ni\u03be2npi\/3.\nThe effective low-energy Hamiltonian is obtained by\ntreating terms other than \u03b31 as perturbations. The ef-\nfective Hamiltonian in a basis {\u03c8A1, \u03c8BN} reads\nH\u02c6\n(eff)\nN =\n(\n0 X(p)\nX\u2020(p) 0\n)\n+\n2vv4p\n2\n\u03b321\n(\n1 0\n0 1\n)\n,\nX(p) =\n\u2211\n{n1,n2,n3}\n(n1 + n2 + n3)!\nn1!n2!n3!\n1\n(\u2212\u03b31)n1+n2+n3\u22121 \u00d7\n(vpei\u03be\u03c6)n1(v3pe\n\u2212i\u03be\u03c6)n2\n(\u03b32\n2\n)n3\n, (14)\nwhere the summation is taken over positive integers\nwhich satisfy n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 = N . Here we collected\nall the higher order terms not including v4, but retain\njust the leading term for v4. The trigonal warping struc-\nture can be described well in this treatment as shown\nbelow, since v4 only gives the circularly-symmetric band\ncurvature as in ABC trilayer.\nThe eigenenergies are given by \u03b5 = 2vv4p\n2\/\u03b321 \u00b1\n|X(p)|. If we neglect \u03b32 and v3, we have X =\n(vpei\u03be\u03c6)N\/(\u2212\u03b31)N\u22121 which gives a pair of bands,\nisotropic in momentum, which touch at the origin [5, 7,\n29, 30]. Berry\u2019s phase integrated along an energy con-\ntour is N\u03be\u03c0 at every energy. Perturbation by \u03b32 and\nv3 produces trigonal warping as observed in the trilayer.\nFigure 5 shows the lower energy band structure for \u03c6 = 0\nat several N \u2019s, where the solid lines are calculated using\nthe original Hamiltonian Eq. (13), and the dashed lines\nuse Eq. (14). We can see that the effective Hamilto-\nnian reproduces the original band structure rather well\nincluding the positions of the band touching points, ex-\ncept that the magnitude in energy tends to be overesti-\nmated around vp \u223c \u03b31 where the perturbative approach\nfails.\nThe band touching points, or Dirac points, are given by\nthe solution of X(p) = 0. They appear in a series of p\u2019s\nat only three angles \u03c60 = 2n\u03c0\/3+(1\u2212\u03be)\u03c0\/6, and around\nwhich the Hamiltonian has a chiral structure similar to\nmonolayer graphene. We empirically found that the ar-\nrangement of these points obeys the following rules: We\nhave [(N + 1)\/3] Dirac points at p 6= 0 at each of three\nangles, and each of them has Berry\u2019s phase \u03be\u03c0. Here\n[x] represents the greatest integer which does not exceed\nx. The Dirac point at the center (p = 0) only appears\nwhen N is not a multiple of 3, and its Berry\u2019s phase is\n\u03be\u03c0 and \u2212\u03be\u03c0 when N \u2261 1 and \u22121 (mod 3) respectively.\nThe total Berry\u2019s phase summed over all Dirac points\nis always N\u03be\u03c0, the same as the value without trigonal\nwarping. The energy scale for fine structure around the\nDirac points becomes smaller as N increases, because the\nFIG. 5: Low-energy band structure of ABC-stacked mul-\ntilayer graphene for several different layer numbers N , at\n\u22061 = \u22062 = 0. Solid and dashed curves are calculated us-\ning Eq. (13) and its approximation Eq. (14), respectively. In-\nsets show the equi-energy lines at \u01eb = 0.04\u03b31. The black and\nwhite arrows (circles in insets) represent Dirac points having\nBerry\u2019s phase \u03be\u03c0 and \u2212\u03be\u03c0, respectively.\nmatrix elements connecting A1 and BN become higher\norder in p for larger N . We see that N = 3 has the most\nprominent structure, where \u03b32 directly connects A1 and\nBN . The parameter v4 never opens a gap at the Dirac\npoints but gives an energy shift by 2vv4p\n2\/\u03b321 and as-\nsociated band curvature, leading to misalignment of the\nDirac point energies as shown in Fig. 5. The curvature is\nindependent of N because it is due to the second order\nprocess from A1 or BN to the nearest-neighboring dimer\nstate.\nThe approach applied to the Landau levels of the tri-\nlayer in Sec. V can be extended to the N -layer case. In\nthe simplest model including only \u03b30 and \u03b31, the Landau\n8levels at K+ read\n\u01ebn = 0, \u03a8nk \u221d\n(\n\u03d5n,k\n0\n)\n(n = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N \u2212 1), (15)\n\u01ebsn = s\n\u2206NB\n\u03b3\n(N\u22121)\n1\n\u221a\nn(n\u2212 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (n\u2212N + 1)\n\u03a8snk \u221d\n(\n\u03d5n,k\ns\u03d5n\u2212N,k\n)\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe (n \u2265 N),\n(16)\nwith s = \u00b11. The first and second elements are again\ninterchanged at the other valley K\u2212. The zero-energy\nlevel is now N -fold degenerate per valley and per spin\n[7, 29, 30]. In presence of trigonal warping and v4, how-\never, this is expected to split in accordance with the dis-\ncrepancy between the energies of different Dirac points\nshown in Fig. 5 for B = 0, while some levels keep three-\nfold degeneracy owing to trigonal symmetry as in the tri-\nlayer case. It is possible that electronic interactions may\ncreate exotic collective modes in such highly-degenerate\nLandau levels, but we leave the discussion of this for fu-\nture studies.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn ABC-stacked multilayer graphene with N layers,\ntwo low-energy bands in the vicinity of each valley are\nformed from two electronic orbitals that lie on the bot-\ntom and top layers of the system. Such bands support\nchiral quasiparticles corresponding to Berry\u2019s phase N\u03c0\n[5, 7, 29, 30]. The interplay between different types of\ninterlayer coupling produces trigonal warping, in which\nthe Fermi circle around each valley is stretched in three\ndirections. At very low energy, trigonal warping leads\nto a Lifshitz transition [33] when the Fermi circle breaks\nup into separate pockets, in such a way that the total\nBerry\u2019s phase is conserved. We predict that the Lifshitz\ntransition is particularly prominent in trilayers, N = 3,\nwith the Fermi circle breaking into three parts at a rel-\natively large energy that is related to next-nearest-layer\ncoupling.\nVIII.
