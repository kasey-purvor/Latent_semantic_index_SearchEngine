Introduction\n[2] Mantle plume\u2010ridge interaction alters the structure and\ncomposition [Ito et al., 2003] as well as the overall geometry\nand location of mid\u2010ocean ridges [Canales et al., 2002;\nHardarson et al., 1997; J\u00f3hannesson, 1980; Jones, 2003;\nM\u00fcller et al., 2001; S\u00e6mundsson, 1974; Wilson and Hey,\n1995]. Changes in ridge location are often caused by a\nplume \u201ccapturing\u201d a nearby ridge axis through ridge propa-\ngation [Hey, 1977; Wilson and Hey, 1995], which probably\ninitiates by discrete shifts or \u201cjumps\u201d of the ridge axis [e.g.,\nHardarson et al., 1997]. Numerous observations indicate that\nrepeated ridge jumps at ridge\u2013hot spot interactions [e.g.,\nBriais and Rabinowicz, 2002; Brozena and White, 1990;\nHardarson et al., 1997; Hey, 1977; J\u00f3hannesson, 1980;\nKrishna et al., 1995; Krishna and Rao, 2000; Mammerickx\nand Sandwell, 1986; M\u00fcller et al., 1993; Nakanishi et al.,\n1999; Small, 1995] can play a significant role in the long\u2010\nterm evolution of the tectonic plates [M\u00fcller et al., 1998,\n2008].\n[3] Ridge jumps toward hot spots have been estimated to\noccur over distances from \u223c101 km at Iceland [Garcia et al.,\n2003; Hardarson et al., 1997] to \u2264800 km at Shatsky Rise\n[Nakanishi et al., 1999] and often occur repeatedly along a\nsingle ridge segment as the distal sections of the overall\nridge axis migrate away from the hot spot. For example,\nIceland has experienced at least four ridge jumps toward the\npresumed plume center in the last 16 Myr [Hardarson et al.,\n1997; J\u00f3hannesson, 1980] as the Mid\u2010Atlantic Ridge has\nmigrated NNW relative to the hot spot [Jones, 2003; Torsvik\net al., 2001]. Repeat ridge jumps are also observed at the\nGal\u00e1pagos [Hey, 1977], the Ninety\u2010East Ridge [Krishna et al.,\n1995; Krishna and Rao, 2000], and possibly the Louisville\nhot spot [Small, 1995].\n1SOEST, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.\n2Now at Laboratoire FAST, CNRS\/UPMC\/UPS, Orsay, France.\n3Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University, Durham, UK.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/11\/2010JB007504\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 116, B01102, doi:10.1029\/2010JB007504, 2011\nB01102 1 of 20\n[4] Two of the principal factors necessary for a ridge jump\nare weakening of off\u2010axis lithosphere and a stress field that\npromotes rifting. One mechanism proposed to weaken the\nlithosphere is the thermal and mechanical erosion of the lith-\nosphere by a laterally spreading mantle plume (i.e., plate\n\u201crejuvenation\u201d) [e.g., Li et al., 2004; Ribe and Christensen,\n1994]. Another proposed weakening mechanism is heating\nof the lithosphere as magma passes through it [Mittelstaedt\net al., 2008]. In fact, thermal as well as mechanical weak-\nening by magma has been suggested to be important to the\ninitiation of rifting in the Gulf of Aden [Kendall et al.,\n2005], during the initial breakup of the North Atlantic\n[Nielsen et al., 2002], to the creation of continental micro-\nplates [M\u00fcller et al., 2001], and to play a key role in\ndetermining the location of hot spot islands [Hieronymus\nand Bercovici, 2001]. The lithospheric stresses that pro-\nmote ridge jumps can be due to far\u2010field tectonic stresses,\nshear tractions on the base of the lithosphere induced by a\nlaterally spreading plume, and plate\u2010parallel gravitational\nstresses due to buoyant uplift of the lithosphere.\n[5] In previous work, Mittelstaedt et al. [2008] examined\nthe contribution of thermal weakening of the lithosphere due\nto magma penetration at a near\u2010ridge hot spot to ridge\njumps. Our method involved imposing magmatic heating in\na zone of fixed width and at a rate proportional to the\ntemperature contrast between magma and the lithosphere\nwhile the lithospheric stress field was controlled by far\u2010field\ntension driving plate spreading. The results suggest that\nmagmatic heating alone can cause ridge jumps, but only on\nyoung, slow moving lithosphere. One shortcoming of these\nmodels was the inability to predict repeat ridge jumps as the\nridge migrates away from the hot spot.\n[6] This study builds upon our previous work by including\nthe contribution of a plume\u2010like upwelling and a new\ndescription of magmatic heating that includes mantle melting\nand melt transport. The goal is to investigate the most basic\nmechanical processes that control ridge jumps associated\nwith plume\u2010ridge interaction. While the documented natural\noccurrences of ridge jumps have distinct and sometimes\nunique characteristics, we aim to examine the factors that are\nlikely to be important to all plume\u2010related ridge jumps and\nquantify the effects of particular geologic variables. We thus\nquantify the behavior of ridge jumps in stationary and\nmigrating systems, for different plume\u2010ridge separation dis-\ntances, spreading rates, plume temperatures and buoyancy\nfluxes, and different heating rates of the lithosphere by\nmagma. The newmodels are the first to spontaneously predict\nrepeat ridge jumps as well as other dynamical behaviors\nincluding single jumps, capture of the ridge by the hot spot,\nand dueling between the new and old rifts. Additionally,\nmagmatic heating of the lithosphere predicted by our models\nprovides another possible mechanism for thinning of the\nlithosphere above intraplate plumes, such as Hawaii.\n2. Conceptual and Mathematical Model\n2.1. Conceptual Model\n[7] Figure 1 illustrates the concepts that set the frame work\nof our mathematical and numerical model. A hot, off\u2010axis\nmantle plume rises,melts, and spreads laterally as it encounters\nthe lithosphere. The buoyant melt percolates vertically through\nthe mantle until it reaches the top of the melting region (i.e., the\nsolidus) where it accumulates within a high\u2010porosity layer just\nbelow the cooler, low\u2010permeability lithosphere. Melt flows\nalong the base of the lithosphere toward a locally eroded depth\nminimum over the plume. As melt accumulates, it builds\npressure on the overlying lithosphere. When the melt pressure\nis high, fractures open in the lithosphere and allow magma to\ntravel to the seafloor. As the magma passes through and heats\nthe plate, the plate thins and weakens. If the weakening is\nsufficient, stresses associated with plate motion and the\nspreading plume initiate rifting off\u2010axis. Eventually, spreading\nshifts from the old to the new ridge axis.\n2.2. Mathematical and Numerical Model of Viscous\nMantle Flow\n[8] We use the finite element code CITCOM [Moresi and\nSolomatov, 1995; van Hunen et al., 2005; Zhong et al.,\nFigure 1. Conceptual model of an upwelling, near\u2010ridge mantle plume, melting, melt transport, and\nmagmatic heating of the lithosphere. Melting generated in the mantle is transported (gray, smaller arrows;\nall arrows are illustrative only) vertically and then along the solidus at the base of the lithosphere toward\nlocal minima in solidus depth where it collects until it builds sufficient pressure to penetrate the litho-\nsphere. Shear stresses are imposed upon the lithosphere due to the solid flow of the upwelling mantle\nplume (black, large arrows).\nMITTELSTAEDT ET AL.: REPEAT RIDGE JUMPS B01102B01102\n2 of 20\n2000] to solve the 2\u2010D equations of conservation of energy,\nmomentum, and mass in a viscoplastic mantle. The model\ndomain measures 1200 km laterally and 400 km vertically\nand is discretized into 512 by 128 elements, respectively.\nThe height and width of each element range between 1.5 km\nand 3.2 km with the highest resolutions in the upper 50 km\nand in the region of plume\u2010ridge interaction. The vertical\nsides of the model are traction free at depths >80 km, where\nthe hot, low\u2010viscosity asthenosphere is present, and are\nimposed to move at a horizontal velocity at shallower\ndepths, where the cooler and stiff lithosphere is present, to\ndrive plate spreading (Figure 2). The horizontal upper sur-\nface is shear traction free with a zero vertical velocity; the\nbottom boundary is traction free (i.e., an open boundary).\nThe thermal boundary conditions include insulating sides\nand imposed potential temperatures of 0\u00b0C and 1300\u00b0C at\nthe top and bottom boundaries, respectively. Within the\nmodel domain, the initial temperature condition is that of\nthe plate model [e.g., Parsons and Sclater, 1977] in which\nthe lithosphere is thinnest at the ridge and increases to a\nmaximum thickness of 125 km.\n[9] To initiate a plume\u2010like upwelling, a hot patch is\nimposed along the bottom of the model with a temperature\nanomaly defined by DT = DTp exp(\u2212Dx2\/(Dxp\/2)2), where\nDx is the horizontal distance from the plume center. The\nmaximum plume temperature of DTp = 300\u00b0C and the\ntemperature anomaly width of Dxp = 80 km result in a\nplume buoyancy flux of \u223c2000 kg s\u22121 (assuming a cylin-\ndrical plume stem) similar to estimates for many hot spots\n[Sleep, 1990; van Hunen and Zhong, 2003; Zhong and\nWatts, 2002].

We do not\nconsider retained melt fraction [Hirth and Kohlstedt, 1995a,\n1995b] or extracted water [Hirth and Kohlstedt, 1996]\nbecause they have competing effects on viscosity, with a net\neffect that is not well understood in natural settings.

As \"p is a\nmaterial variable, we track its advection using tracer parti-\ncles [Bianco et al., 2008]. This method forms regions of\nplate rifting across \u223c10\u201320 elements with faster spreading\nrates leading to more focused deformation. Thus, the model\nresolution of \u223c1.5 km in the region of plume\u2010ridge inter-\naction allows for plate boundary widths of 15\u201330 km for\nhalf spreading rates between 10 and 30 km Myr\u22121.\n2.3. Mantle Melting\n[12] We use a description of decompression melting of a\ndry, peridotite mantle to calculate melt productivity \u2202F\/\u2202P\nwhere F is the melt fraction and P is pressure. The melting\nregion is bounded by the peridotite solidus Tsolidus of Katz\net al. [2003, Figure 1]. At a given pressure P, when the\npotential temperature T surpasses Tsolidus, a constant \u2202T\/\u2202F\nand a constant change in entropy DS (associated with con-\nverting a solid to a liquid) are used to calculate \u2202F\/\u2202P [e.g.,\nAsimow et al., 2004; Ito and Mahoney, 2005; Katz et al.,\n2003]\n\u0002 @F\n@P\n\u00bc\n@T\n@P\n\u0001 \u0003\nF\n\u0002 \bT\n\tcp\n@T\n@F\n\u0001 \u0003\nP\n\u00fe TDS\ncp\n; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere a is the coefficient of thermal expansivity, cp is the\nheat capacity at constant pressure, and r is the mantle\ndensity. The value of \u2202T\/\u2202F and DS are chosen (see list of\nsymbols in Table 1) so that the model predicts a normal\nridge crustal thickness of 6\u20137 km in the absence of a mantle\nplume. The value of F is limited to \u223c0.2 to simulate the\nstrong reduction in \u2202F\/\u2202P when cpx is completely melted\n[Asimow et al., 1997, 2004]. This parameterization is very\nsimple; the only variations of \u2202F\/\u2202P with depth are associ-\nated with the slope of the solidus and not, for example, with\nwater content or mineralogy. More realism is not needed\nbecause what is most essential to this study is the ability to\nsimulate self\u2010consistent changes in melt flux reaching the\nsolidus at the base of the lithosphere in response to local\nfluctuations in mantle temperature and flow.\n2.4. Melt Transport and Penetration of the Lithosphere\n[13] The melt transport equations used here are based on\nthose introduced by McKenzie [1984] to describe the con-\nservation of mass and momentum of a two\u2010phase system\n(see Appendix A). We assume that the shear and effective\nbulk viscosities of the matrix are too low for pressure gra-\ndients associated with solid shear or compaction to influence\nmelt flow. At the top of the melting region (i.e., the solidus),\nwhere T \u2264 Tsolidus, freezing melt makes a boundary that is\nimpermeable to flow and leads to formation of a high\u2010\nporosity channel [Sparks and Parmentier, 1991, 1994;\nSpiegelman, 1993]. As a result of the above assumptions,\npressure gradients associated with melt buoyancy alone\ncause melt to rise vertically in the melting zone and to flow\nlaterally along the sloping solidus near the base of the\nlithosphere.\n[14] It is the lateral transport of melt along the base of the\nlithosphere and vertical penetration of melt through the\nlithosphere that is essential to the model results. Here, lateral\nmelt flow is controlled by the average porosity (volume\nfraction of melt) \u0004 in the high\u2010porosity channel below the\nfreezing boundary, whereas melt flux across the freezing\nboundary (through the lithosphere) is controlled by the\ndepth\u2010averaged porosity of the lithosphere F. The time\u2010\ndependent melt transport along and across the solidus is\ndescribed by (Appendix A)\n@\tm\u0004\n@t\n\u00fe \tm @u\n@x\n\u00fe @w\n@z\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u00bc 0; \u00f07\u00de\nu \u00bc \u0002k0\u0004\nn\n\nm\n\ts \u0002 \tm\u00f0 \u00deg sin \u0003\u00f0 \u00de \u00feDZ @\u0004\n@x\n\u0004 \u0005\n; \u00f08\u00de\nwmantle \u00bc \u0002\nZZsolidus\nZmax\ndF\ndP\n\u0001 \u0003\n\tsgWdZ; \u00f09\u00de\nwlith \u00bc \u0002k0F\nn\n\nm\n\ts \u0002 \tm\u00f0 \u00deg cos \u0003\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere u is the Darcy melt flow rate times porosity parallel\nto the solidus; w is the melt flow rate perpendicular to the\nsolidus; W is the vertical velocity of the matrix (capital\nletters indicate solid velocities); rm is the melt density and\nrs is the solid density; n = 2 is the exponent relating\nporosity to permeability. See Table 1 for the definition of\nother variables. Equation (7) describes conservation of melt\nmass whereas equation (8) describes Darcy flow (conser-\nvation of momentum) of the melt in the direction parallel\nto the solidus x. The assumption of 1\u2010D melt transport\nalong the solidus allows us to solve separately the equa-\ntions defining melt supply created in the mantle below the\nhigh\u2010porosity channel, wmantle (9), and that penetrating\nthe lithosphere above the channel, wlith (10, discussed\nbelow), the difference of which is used to compute \u2202w\/\u2202z\nin equation (7).\n[15] To isolate the fundamental parameters that govern\nporosity in the channel, we combine (7) and (8), make\nvariables dimensionless (denoted by primes) as described in\nMITTELSTAEDT ET AL.: REPEAT RIDGE JUMPS B01102B01102\n5 of 20\nAppendix A, and derive the dimensionless governing\nequation (see Table 1 for definition of all variables),\n@\u0004\u2032\n@t\u2032\n\u0002 @\n@x\u2032\n\u0004\u2032n\n@\u0004\u2032\n@x\u2032\n\u0004 \u0005\n\u0002 Pe \u0004\u2032n\u00021 sin \u0003\u00f0 \u00de @\u0004\u2032\n@x\u2032\n\u0002 \u0004\u2032\nn\nn\ncos \u0003\u00f0 \u00de @\u0003\n@x\u2032\n\u0004 \u0005\n\u00bc wmantle\u2032 \u0002 wl0wm0 wlith\u2032 : \u00f011\u00de\nTwo input parameters control melt transport: the Pecl\u00e9t\nnumber Pe, and the ratio of scales for the flow rate of melt\nthrough the lithosphere and up from the mantle wl0\/wm0.\n[16] The other essential aspect of the magma transport\nmodel is to simulate when and where magma actually\npenetrates the lithosphere (i.e., where and when w\u2032lith > 0).\nEquation (10) describes the depth\u2010averaged magma flux\n(per area) through the lithosphere wlith due to general\nmechanisms which could include intergranular porous flow,\ninterconnected melt channels, and diking. As such, wlith\ndepends on the average fraction of melt in the lithosphere, or\nporosity F. Following a methodology similar to that of\nHieronymus and Bercovici [2001], we assume that changes\nin F are caused by changes in the excess pressure of the\nmagma just below the plate sp and lithospheric damage\n(generally to include chemical, thermal, and structural\ndamage) caused by magma passing through the plate (see\nAppendix A)\nF \u00bc Fmax\n2\n1\u00fe tanh \u0005p \u0002 \u0005c \u00fe L0H\n2C0=Fmax\n\u0001 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\n; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere Lo and Co are constants, sc is the inherent (constant)\nstrength of the lithosphere, Fmax is the maximum permitted\nlithospheric porosity, and H is a fraction of the integrated\nmelt flux, a measure of the accumulated magmatic damage\n(described below).\n[17] We normalize sp and sc by a pressure scale that is\nproportional to \u00040, and normalize H by H0 to derive the\nnondimensional form of (10)\nwlith\u2032 \u00bc cos \u0003 1\u00fe tanh\n\u0004\u2032 cos \u0003\nD\u2032\n\u0002 \u0005c\u2032\nD\u2032\n\u00fe L0\u2032 H \u2032\nD\u2032\n\u0001 \u0003\u0004 \u0005n\n\u00f013\u00de\n(see Appendix for more details). Equation (13) describes the\nvertical melt flux across the solidus as a balance between the\nscaled porosity along the solidus \u0004\u2032, which controls the melt\npressure from the high\u2010porosity channel below the solidus,\nthe scaled strength of the lithosphere s\u2032c, the sensitivity to\nmagmatic damage L\u20320, where L\u20320H \u2032 is a measure of the\naccumulated lithospheric damage due to prior magmatism,\nand the scale factor D\u2032. The total damage is not permitted to\nexceed the strength of the lithosphere (i.e., L\u20320H \u2032 \u2264 s\u2032c ). In\npractice, this limit is rarely reached for the chosen value of\nL\u20320 (Table 1). Three free parameters control equation (13):\ns\u2032c, L\u20320, and D \u2032.\n[18] Lithospheric damage is assumed to occur through\nthermal, chemical, or physical mechanisms of recent vol-\ncanism. The quantity that measures this damage is H and is\ncalculated using the following (dimensional) advection\nequation\n@H\n@t\n\u00bc wlith \u0002 @ HUrate\u00f0 \u00de\n@X\n\u0002 S\nH \u00fe H0\u00f0 \u00de2\n; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere X is the lateral coordinate in the absolute reference\nframe (i.e., not along the solidus). With only the first term\non the right\u2010hand side, H would equal\nR\nwlithdt, the time\u2010\nintegrated magma flow through a given section of litho-\nsphere. The second term on the right hand side describes\nadvection of damage with a plate migrating horizontally at a\nhalf spreading rate of Urate, and the third term describes the\nreduction of damage by healing. With this formulation (see\nAppendix for details), more damaged lithosphere (larger H)\nheals more slowly than less damaged lithosphere (smaller H;\nan analogous behavior is seen in concrete compression\nexperiments [Zhong and Yao, 2008]), and the damage ini-\ntiated in pristine lithosphere heals at a maximum rate of\nS\/H0\n2. This maximum healing rate sets the minimum magma\npenetration rate wlith where damage begins to accumulate.\nEquation (14) introduces one more free parameter, S.\n[19] In summary, (11), (13), and (14) control magma flow\nin the asthenosphere and through the lithosphere. The fol-\nlowing procedure is used to solve these equations and\ncouple them to the calculations of mantle melting and\ntemperature each time step. First, the location and slope of\nthe solidus are determined from the solutions of solid flow\nand heat transfer. Next, the melt supply from below wmantle\nis calculated from (9). The value of wlith at each point along\nthe solidus is found using (13) with the damage variable H\nfrom the previous time step. Equation (11) is then solved for\nthe transport of melt along the solidus. Finally, H is updated\nusing equation (14). Analytical solutions of (11) are used to\nverify the method (Appendix A). The free parameters are\nPe, wl0\/wm0, H0, L\u20320, D\u2032, and S (see Table 1 for values).\nMagmatic heating of the lithosphere is calculated as\ndescribed in section 2.5.\n2.5. Magmatic Heating\n[20] In a formulation similar to that of Mittelstaedt et al.\n[2008], the (dimensional) magmatic heating rate at each\npoint in the lithosphere is defined as\nq \u00bc \tcp\u000bwlith Tasth \u0002 T X ; Z; t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0004 \u00f015a\u00de\nqmax \u0005 \tcpTasth\u000bwmaxlith ; \u00f015b\u00de\nwhere Tasth is the temperature of both the nonplume\nasthenosphere and the penetrating magma (1300\u00b0C), b (m\u22121)\nis a constant scale factor controlling the heating rate, wlith\n(m s\u22121) is the magma penetration rate (or volumetric flux per\nunit cross\u2010sectional area) through the lithosphere which\nreaches a maximum value wlith\nmax before a ridge jump, X and\nZ are coordinates of the absolute reference frame, and qmax\nis the maximum heating rate before a ridge jump (used in our\nscaling analysis, section 3.3). Consistent with (13), which\ndescribes melt flux through the lithosphere, (15a) is designed\nto be as general as possible and to not require a specific\nmelt transport mechanism in the lithosphere (seeMittelstaedt\net al. [2008] for further discussion).\n[21] We examine cases withwlith calculated from (11)\u2013(14)\nand a constant value of b (b is varied between 9 \u00d7 10\u22126 m\u22121\nand 10 \u00d7 10\u22125 m\u22121) in (15a). To explore a range of model\nbehaviors, cases are run with half spreading rates of 10, 20,\nand 30 km Myr\u22121, plate ages above the center of plume\nupwelling between 3 and 15Myr, and for a few cases, we vary\nMITTELSTAEDT ET AL.: REPEAT RIDGE JUMPS B01102B01102\n6 of 20\nexcess plume temperature and buoyancy flux. Additionally,\nwe consider some cases where the plume and ridge migrate\nrelative to each other.\n3. Results\n3.1. Controlling Parameters of Melt Transport:\nSimplified Test Cases\n[22] Six free parameters control melt transport along and\nthrough the lithosphere. Various tests reveal that final model\npredictions are relatively insensitive to wl0\/wm0, H0, and D\u2032\nand most sensitive to the three parameters Pe, L\u20320, and S.\nThe effects of Pe, L\u20320, and S are explored with a set of\npreliminary calculations that involve solving (11)\u2013(14)\nalone, without the Citcom calculations of mantle flow and\ntemperature (Figure 3).\n[23] First, we examine how flow along the solidus is\ninfluenced by Pe, which governs the relative importance of\nsolidus slope versus lateral variations in \u0004\u2032. The problem\nexamines the steady state porosity beneath a solidus that is\nshallowest at X \u2032 = 30 and slopes away from this point, much\nlike that beneath a lithospheric plate as it thickens away\nfrom a ridge axis (Figure 3a) (X is the horizontal dimension\nand X\u2032 = X\/d is dimensionless). In this test case, the melt\nsupply from below is a Gaussian function of X\u2032 also centered\nat X\u2032 = 30, L\u20320 = 0 (melt escapes out of the ridge center at X\u2032 =\n30, but no damage accumulates), S = 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 m2 s\u22121, and\n\u0004\u2032 = 0 is the boundary condition on the left and right sides\nof the domain. Smaller values of Pe tend to reduce lateral\nporosity variations, whereas larger values of Pe lead to a\nlocal peak in porosity (melt accumulation) where the solidus\nis shallowest (Figure 3a).\n[24] The second test case (Figure 3b) demonstrates the\neffect of the healing rate scale S on the focusing of magma\npenetration through the off\u2010axis lithosphere. Roughly sim-\nulating a ridge and an off\u2010axis hot spot, the solidus slopes at\na constant angle (10\u00b0) down to the right away from the\nhypothetical ridge axis (at X\u2032 = 0) and the melt supply from\nbelow is highest at X\u2032 = 50 (Figure 3b). Accumulated lith-\nospheric damage (proportional to) H\u2032 is advected to the right\nat a constant velocity (10 km Myr\u22121) with the plate, \u0004\u2032 = 0\non the right edge, and \u2202\u0004\u2032\/\u2202X\u2032 = 0 at the left edge.

Larger\nvalues of S lead to more focused zones of damage because\nthey restrict the distance over which magma penetration is\nlarge enough to initiate damage (equations (13) and (14))\n(Figure 3b).\n[25] Finally, the third case discussed here demonstrates\nhow the sensitivity (L\u20320) of w\u2032lith to damage affects the width\nand location of magma penetration through the lithosphere\nFigure 4.

Resembling a situation of hot spot\u2013ridge\ninteraction, the solidus deepens with the square of the dis-\ntance from a \u201cridge axis\u201d which is centered at X\u2032 = 30; the\nmelt supply from below is equal to the sum of two Gaus-\nsians with peaks at X\u2032 = 30 and at X\u2032 = 60 (the \u201cridge\u201d and\n\u201cplume\u201d melt supplies), and \u0004\u2032 = 0 imposed on the left and\nright edges (Figure 3c); Pe = 0.1, and S = 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 m2 s\u22121.\nOnce damage begins to accumulate, larger values of L\u20320 lead\nto greater fluxes of magma penetrating the lithosphere. The\ngreater magma fluxes cause more damage to accumulate and\nreduce the healing rate, which together cause a positive\nfeedback that focuses the magma penetration at two narrow\npeaks (Figure 3c), one at the ridge axis and one over the hot\nspot.\n[26] The restriction of magma penetration to such narrow\nzones (e.g., comparable to the width of a hot spot island) is\nessential for the associated magmatic heating to sufficiently\nweaken the lithosphere for a ridge jump. The final chosen\nvalues of Pe, L\u20320, and S (see Table 1) used in our full\nnumerical calculations lead to eruptive zones at the hot spot\nand ridge across \u223c10\u201320 km for most cases, and are kept the\nsame for all model cases below.\n3.2. Time Evolution: Full Simulations With Fixed\nPlume\u2010Ridge Separation Distance\n[27] With the above parameters controlling melt transport\nfixed, full simulations of time\u2010dependent plume\u2010ridge\ninteraction and melt transport are used to study the effects\nof the more geologically relevant parameters: b, spreading\nrate Urate, initial lithospheric thickness Zlith (or seafloor\nage tage) at the hot spot, and relative motion between the\nridge and hot spot Umig. The range of values considered in\nthese geologic parameters is relevant to a variety of natural\nexamples, which we discuss below.\n[28] The first set of calculations involve a ridge that is\nfixed relative to a plume (Figures 4a\u20134d, Umig = 0). Melt\ntransport and lithospheric heating are initiated after the\nplume impacts the lithosphere and begins to spread across\nthe box, which defines time t = 0. Again, the imposed plume\nanomaly at the bottom of the model has a Gaussian width of\n80 km and a peak excess temperature of 300\u00b0C. For the\nexample case shown in Figure 4, the half spreading rate,\nUrate, is 30 km Myr\n\u22121 and the heating parameter b = 3.0 \u00d7\n10\u22125 m\u22121 (equation (15a)). Melting occurs beneath the ridge\naxis and within the plume stem. Initially (t = 0.17 Myr), the\nmagma penetrating the ridge axis lithosphere comes from\nboth the plume and ridge melting zones (generating a melt\nthickness of \u223c30\u201340 km) and is focused to a zone \u223c15 km\nwide; but off axis, above the plume, a small magma flux\npasses through the undamaged lithosphere over a broad\nregion (\u223c150 km wide) (Figure 4a, top). After several\nFigure 5. (a) Ridge jumps (solid symbols) occur when the\nvalue of the maximum heating rate qmax is above a critical\nvalue (black line) but not, in general, for values less than this\n(open symbols). Symbols for different spreading rates are as\nlabeled. (b) The model results show a similar fit to the scal-\ning law when plotted versus Qcool (equations (20a) and\n(20b)). This relationship is used to calculate the curves in\nFigure 8 and to predict the minimum value of qmax for hot\nspots in Figures 5c and 6a (except for Gal0, where no jump\nhas occurred and we predict the maximum qmax).

A feedback develops in which an\nincreasing off\u2010axis magma flux thins the off\u2010axis litho-\nsphere which causes the solidus to shoal near the hot spot,\nwhich further enhances magma penetration. The continued\ndamage accumulation and thinning of the lithosphere\neventually constricts the off\u2010axis magmatism to a width\ncomparable to that at the ridge axis. As the off\u2010axis magma\nflux increases, the flux at the ridge decreases. Soon there-\nafter (t = 2.3 Myr) rifting over the hot spot begins, and as it\ndoes so, warm mantle material rises into the protorift which\nfurther weakens the lithosphere and promotes faster rifting.\nDuring this transfer of spreading from the old to the new\nridge axis (t = 2.0\u20132.9 Myr), the lithosphere between the\nrifts acts as a microplate with very little, to no visible\nvelocity gradients across its surface (Figure 4c). Finally, all\nspreading is accommodated at the new ridge axis and the old\nridge is abandoned (t = 5.5 Myr, Figure 4d).\n3.3. Scaling Analysis of Model Results:\nFixed Plume\u2010Ridge Separation Distance\n[29] The main model results are described in terms of\nbasic quantities that reveal the important physical processes\nand are themselves functions of the pertinent geologic\nvariables. The first quantity characterizes the rate that\nmagma heats the lithosphere. For this quantity we use qmax\n(equation (15b)), which again is the product of the heating\nrate factor b and the maximum magma flow rate through the\noff\u2010axis lithosphere wlith\nmax (1.5\u20133.0 \u00d7 10\u22129 m s\u22121, which\nwould generate \u223c5\u201340 km of excess crust if erupted at the\nridge axis, spreading at Urate = 10\u201350 km Myr\n\u22121, and\nmagmatic accretion zone 5 km wide). This quantity is\nanalogous to the scale factor Qhot spot (total heating rate at t =\n0) used by Mittelstaedt et al. [2008].\n[30] The second quantity is a measure of the thermal\nresilience of the lithosphere. Mittelstaedt et al. [2008]\ndefined thermal resilience as the heating rate required to\nthermally remove the lithosphere,\nQthin DX\u00f0 \u00de \u0005 \tcpUrate\nZZlith\n0\nTasth \u0002 T DX ; Z\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00det\u00bc0dZ\n2\n4\n3\n5; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere Zlith is the initial thickness of the lithosphere a dis-\ntance DX from the ridge axis where a ridge jump occurs or,\nin cases without a jump, above the plume center. Similar to\nMittelstaedt et al. [2008], we find that for a given value of\nthermal resilience Qthin there is a minimum value of mag-\nmatic heating rate qmax required to initiate a ridge jump and\nthis value increases nonlinearly with Qthin (Figure 5a),\nqmax \u0006 a Qthin\u00f0 \u00deb\u00fec; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere least squares regression yields a = \u22120.23 J(b\u22121) m(b\u22123)\ns(b\u22121), b = \u22120.5, and c = 0.0016 J m\u22123 s\u22121. The lithospheric\nthermal resilience parameter Qthin, however, does not have\na straightforward relationship with commonly observed\nvalues such as seafloor age. A revised measure of the\nlithosphere\u2019s thermal resilience is therefore the spreading\nrate times the time\u2010integrated surface heat loss of a cooling\nhalf\u2010space:\nQcool \u0005\nZtage\n0\nUrate\tcp Tasth\u00f0 \u00de\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u0007\f\npffiffi\nt\np dt \u00bc 2Urate\tcpTasthffiffiffi\n\f\np ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\u0007tagep ; \u00f018\u00de\nin which tage is the age of the seafloor at DX. Intuitively,\nthrough its dependence on\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ntage\np\n, Qcool is proportional to the\nthickness of the lithosphere predicted by a cooling semi\u2010\ninfinite half\u2010space Zlith = 2\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u0007tage\np\n. Indeed, the minimum\nmagmatic heating rate qmax needed to cause a ridge jump\nincreases with this measure of thermal resilience much like\nwith Qthin,\nqmax \u0006 a Qcool\u00f0 \u00deb\u00fec; \u00f019\u00de\nwith a = \u22120.044 J(b\u22121) m(b\u22123) s(b\u22121), b = \u22120.3, and c =\n0.0023 J m\u22123 s\u22121 (Figure 5b). For several natural systems\nwith ridge jumps, we use (19) with observations of Urate\nand tage (equation (18)), to infer a minimum qmax for each\nof these systems (see Figure 5b and Table 2).\n[31] Another model output quantity that closely relates to\ngeologic observations is the predicted times from the start of\nmagmatic heating to when the jump is complete, tjump.\nValues are well fit if tjump is normalized by seafloor age at\nthe location of the incipient rift tage (Figure 5c):\ntjump\ntage\n\u00bc d qmaxDX\n\u0007\u00f0 \u00de1=2\n !e\n\u00fe f ; \u00f020a\u00de\nwhere DX (= tageUrate) is the distance between the incipient\nrift and the initial ridge axis, d = 4.37 \u00d7 103 Je m3e se\/2, e =\n\u22120.92, and f = 0.26. For several natural systems, observed\nvalues of tjump\/tage and DX and the minimum qmax inferred\nfor these systems from equation (19) are shown for com-\nTable 2.

The last relation reveals that a\nlarger solidus slope tends to channel more magma to the\ninitial ridge axis at the expense of magma penetrating the\noff\u2010axis lithosphere. These results indicate that melt trans-\nport is an important mechanism for controlling the timing of\nridge jumps.\n3.4. Migrating Ridges\n[32] The next set of calculations simulates relative motion\nbetween the plume and ridge by moving the location of the\nimposed plume temperature anomaly relative to the model\nboundaries at a constant rate Umig. The model domain for\nthese cases is 2000 km wide with a uniform element width\nof \u223c2 km (1024 elements). Other model conditions are\nunchanged. The plume is initially held stationary beneath\nthe ridge axis and is allowed to rise and spread laterally\nbeneath the lithosphere until the thermal profile beneath the\nridge is at steady state (i.e., the subridge mantle is displaced\nby plume material; a few million years). At this time (t \u2261 0)\nmelt transport, magmatic heating, and plume migration are\nactivated.\n[33] Figures 4e\u20134h display an example of the time evo-\nlution for a case with a relative velocity between the plume\nand the original ridge axis location (Urate = 10 km Myr\n\u22121,\nUmig = 10 km Myr\n\u22121, b = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 m\u22121). Initially, all of the\nmelt produced travels to the ridge axis, and there is negli-\ngible off\u2010axis magmatism and heating. After the plume\nmigrates a distance of \u223c50\u201370 km (t = 7.3 Myr), an off\u2010axis\nregion of melt penetration develops \u223c30\u201350 km from the\nridge (Figure 4e). As the plume continues to migrate relative\nto the ridge, the off\u2010axis magma flux focuses to a narrow\nregion, the overlying lithosphere thins, and rifting pulls up\nwarm asthenosphere, which further weakens the lithosphere\nuntil a new ridge axis forms. The time between t = 0 and the\nridge jump is significantly longer (tjump \u223c 27 Myr) than for\nnonmigrating cases with the same values of the other\nparameters (Figure 4f). After the initial ridge jump is com-\nplete, the majority of melt from the plume travels toward\nthe new ridge due to the steeply sloping lithosphere cur-\nrently above the plume. The peak in magma flux penetrating\nthe off\u2010axis lithosphere is just plume\u2010ward of the new ridge\nFigure 6. (a) Cases where the plume migrates relative to\nthe ridge axis display a variety of behaviors listed in order\nof increasing plume influence (increasing symbol size): no\njumps (white circles), two \u201cdueling\u201d rifts with divergence\nshifting between them (light gray circles), a single ridge\njump (gray circles), repeat ridge jumps (dark gray circles),\nand immediate ridge capture (black circles). The ratio of\nthe maximum magmatic heating rate to the lithospheric ther-\nmal resilience per thickness of lithosphere qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith)\nand the difference between the half spreading rate and the\nmigration rate Urate \u2212 Umig effectively describe the range\nof behaviors. Results suggest a maximum in plume influ-\nence for small, positive values of Urate \u2212 Umig (gray, dashed\nlines). Values for natural hot spot\u2013ridge systems (gray\nboxes) are placed along the horizontal axis in accordance\nwith published spreading and ridge migration rates and\nalong the vertical axis according minimum predicted qmax\nvalues required to jump in Figure 5b. Labels and refer-\nences are as follows: Asc, Ascension [Brozena and White,\n1990]; Gal0, Gal4, Gal10, Galapagos in its current config-\nuration (0 Ma), at 4 Ma, and at 10 Ma, respectively [Harpp\nand Geist, 2002; Wilson and Hey, 1995]; Ice, Iceland\n[Jones, 2003; LaFemina et al., 2005; Torsvik et al., 2001].\nSee Table 2 for values used. Where ridge jumps have been\nobserved, the predicted qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) is expected to be\nminimal (up arrows). For the modern day Galapagos (Gal0)\nwithout jumps, the predicted qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) is expected to\nbe maximal (down arrow). At the Galapagos hot spot, qmax\/\n(Qcool\/Zlith) is predicted to increase during 10\u20135 Ma (repeat\nridge jumps to ridge capture) and to decrease during \u223c2.5\u20130\nMa (ridge capture to no jumps). (b) This predicted evolution\nin qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) roughly mirrors the evolution of the\nmagma volume flux at the Galapagos Islands (modified\nfrom Ito et al. [1997]).\nMITTELSTAEDT ET AL.: REPEAT RIDGE JUMPS B01102B01102\n11 of 20\naxis (Figure 4g). This offset tends to make the ridge migrate\nwith the plume, but at a slightly slower rate than the plume\nitself. The plume essentially \u201ccaptures\u201d the ridge for a short\ntime. After the plume moves sufficiently far from the ridge,\na new, separate peak in off\u2010axis magma flux appears. The\nfeedback between off\u2010axis lithospheric thinning and\nenhanced melt transport begins anew until the ridge jumps a\nsecond time (t = 50 Myr) (Figure 4h).\n[34] In addition to repeat ridge jumps, different values of\nUrate, Umig, and the magmatic heating rate qmax lead to other\nbehaviors. Characterizing different levels of plume influence\non the ridge, from least to greatest, the behaviors include no\njumps (i.e., minimum influence), \u201cdueling\u201d rifts where each\nrift accommodates a fraction of the total spreading rate that\nvaries through time, single jumps, and a rapid jump fol-\nlowed by continued migration of the ridge axis with the\nplume, i.e., complete \u201cridge capture\u201d (maximum influence).\nThe different behaviors appear to depend primarily on two\nquantities: Urate \u2212 Umig, the difference between the plume\nspreading rate and the migration rate, and qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith),\na ratio of the magmatic heating rate to the thermal resilience\nper thickness of the lithosphere Zlith (Figure 6). Urate \u2212 Umig,\nis the rate of absolute plate motion over the plume as the\nridge migrates away from the plume. Note that qmax\/(Qcool\/\nZlith) = qmax\nffiffiffi\n\f\np\n\/UratercpTasth is independent of Zlith because\nof the proportionality of Qcool with Zlith. Large values of\nqmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith), at a given relative plate motion (Urate \u2212\nUmig), lead to cases with complete ridge capture while small\nvalues of qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) lead to cases without ridge jumps\n(Figure 6a). For Urate \u2212 Umig \u2248 0 (i.e., little motion between\nplume and overlying plate), an increasing qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith)\nleads to a steady increase in plume influence, again from\nleast to most: no jumps (qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) \u223c0.1 \u00d7 10\u22123),\n\u201cdueling\u201d rifts, single jumps, repeat jumps, and ridge cap-\nture (qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) \u223c0.7 \u00d7 10\u22123). The plume influence\nappears to be greatest (i.e., jumps begin at the lowest qmax\/\n(Qcool\/Zlith)) between Urate \u2212 Umig = 0\u201310 km Myr\u22121 (gray,\ndashed lines in Figure 6a) and generally requires greater\nqmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) for the same behavior as Urate \u2212 Umig\ndeviates away from the point of maximum influence near\n0\u201310 km Myr\u22121. At a fixed qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith), for example\nqmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) \u2248 0.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 m\u22121, cases withUrate \u2212Umig \u2248 0\nresult in \u201cdueling\u201d rifts, cases with Urate \u2212 Umig \u2264 \u223c \u22122 km\nMyr\u22121 do not jump, and for Urate \u2212 Umig increasing from\n\u223c10 to \u223c20 km Myr\u22121 cases result in repeat ridge jumps and\nfinally no jumps.\n[35] The tendency for plume influence to increase with\nqmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) is mostly intuitive, whereas the changes\nin behavior with Urate \u2212 Umig is less straightforward but\nreflects different ways in which ridge jumps are influenced\nby melt transport and magmatic heating. For example,\nincreases in Urate promote ridge jumps by decreasing lith-\nospheric thickness and slope \u2202Zlith\/\u2202X at a given distance\nDX (i.e., less melt is transported to the ridge). Increases in\nthe absolute value of Urate \u2212 Umig inhibit ridge jumps by\nincreasing the rate that the plate moves through the hot spot\nheating zone, thus decreasing the time a given piece of\nlithosphere can be heated. The direction or sign of Urate \u2212\nUmig is also important. When Urate \u2212 Umig < 0 (absolute\nplate motion to the left in Figure 6) older, thicker lithosphere\nthat has seen less magmatic heating is being delivered to the\nmagmatic heating zone, but when Urate \u2212 Umig > 0 (absolute\nplate motion to the right in Figure 6) younger, thinner\nlithosphere that has seen extensive magmatic heating is\nbeing delivered to the magmatic heating zone. The above\neffects sometimes compete and sometimes reinforce each\nother to varying degrees.\n3.5. Variations in Plume Temperature\nand Buoyancy Flux\n[36] Figure 7 displays how tjump is influenced by changes\nin plume excess temperature DTp and the width of the\nplume (the effects of changing width with constant DTp are\nshown in terms of the resulting changes in buoyancy flux B\nfor ease of comparison to other work). We vary DTp and B\nfor two different types of cases. For type 1, the values of\nboth b and wlith are artificially held constant (bwlith = 1.5 \u00d7\n10\u221213 s\u22121) across a zone of heating 12 km wide, the half\nspreading rate is 10 km Myr\u22121, and the fixed plume\u2010\nridge separation distance is 100 km. For type 2, magmatic\nheating is calculated from (11)\u2013(15a) and (15b), b = 6.5 \u00d7\n10\u22125 m\u22121, qmax = 0.91 \u00d7 10\n\u22126 J m\u22123 s\u22121, the off\u2010axis mag-\nmatic heating zone varies in width through time between\n15 and 100 km, half spreading rate is 20 km Myr\u22121, and\nplume\u2010ridge separation distance is 200 km.\n[37] For cases of type 1, changes in DTp and B only\ninfluence heat conduction and stress in the mantle but do not\nchange the (fixed) magmatic heating rate in the lithosphere.\nThe value of tjump increases with increasing DTp (Figure 7a)\nbut decreases with increasing B at fixed DTp (Figure 7b).\nAlthough larger DTp result in larger B, the principle control\non tjump when DTp is increased is weakening of the ridge\naxis caused by the warmer underlying mantle. When B is\nincreased without changes in DTp (larger volume flux), the\ndecrease in tjump is promoted by an increase in lithospheric\nFigure 7. (a) Increasing plume temperature DTp for a case\nof type 1 (imposed, constant magma penetration rate\nthrough the lithosphere) decreases the ridge axis strength\nand results in larger values of tjump. Increases in DTp in\ntype 2 (melting controls magma penetration rate) cases\nresult in sharp decreases in tjump due to increasing melt sup-\nply from the mantle at the hot spot. (b) Increases in the\nbuoyancy flux B at constant DTp (changes to plume conduit\nwidth) of both type 1 and type 2 cause a decrease in tjump.\nMITTELSTAEDT ET AL.: REPEAT RIDGE JUMPS B01102B01102\n12 of 20\ntension above the plume due to the enhanced shear between\nthe spreading plume material and the overlying plate.\n[38] For cases of type 2, changes in DTp and B cause\nchanges not only in mantle temperature and the stress field,\nbut they also change the melt supply from the plume. Unlike\nthe cases of type 1, increases in DTp and B for type 2 both\nlead to decreases in tjump (Figures 7a and 7b). Over the range\nof DTp examined (300\u00b0C\u2013350\u00b0C), there is a large decrease\nin tjump (\u223c3 Myr) due to increasing values of magma flow\nrate through the lithosphere associated with greater plume\nmelting. In fact, for the case shown in Figure 7, values of\nDTp \u2264 250\u00b0C do not result in a ridge jump. Like type 1,\ntype 2 cases predict a decrease in tjump with larger values of\nB, but the sensitivity to B is larger, presumably because\nof the added dependence of melt generation on B.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Mid\u2010ocean Ridge Jumps: Predicted Trends\nand Observations\n[39] Mid\u2010ocean ridge jumps associated with plume\u2010ridge\ninteraction are observed near current and former locations\nof many hot spots including Iceland [Hardarson et al.,\n1997; J\u00f3hannesson, 1980], the Galapagos [Wilson and Hey,\n1995], Ascension [Brozena and White, 1990], Shona\n[Small, 1995], Shatsky Rise [Nakanishi et al., 1999], Louis-\nville [G\u00e9li et al., 1998; Small, 1995], and along the Ninety\u2010\nEast Ridge [Desa et al., 2006; Krishna et al., 1995; Krishna\nand Rao, 2000; Small, 1995]. In Figure 5c, we compare the\ntrend predicted by equations (20a) and (20b) to observed\nvalues of tjump\/tage andDX and inferred values of qmax at four\nhot spots: Ascension, Iceland (since \u223c16 Ma), Galapagos (at\n10 Ma), and Louisville. Again the inferred values of qmax\ncome from equation (19) and observationally constrained\nvalues of Qcool (Figure 5b). The observed values of tjump are\nconstrained by magnetic and bathymetric observations at\nAscension (\u223c0.7 Myr [Brozena and White, 1990]), dating of\nrift zone lavas at Iceland (\u223c8 Myr [Hardarson et al., 1997]),\nmodels of magnetic anomalies at the Galapagos requiring 3\u20134\njumps between 5 and 10 Ma (\u223c1.6\u20132.5 Myr [Wilson and Hey,\n1995]), and the width of magnetic anomaly 2A at Louisville\n(\u223c\u22641 Ma [Small, 1995]). The values of tage are from refer-\nences in Figure 6 or calculated as described in Table 2. In\nFigure 5c, Iceland, the Galapagos, and Louisville plot very\nclose to the predicted trend suggesting that the value of qmax\nfor these hot spots may be close to the actual value. However,\nthe predicted value of the minimum qmax to jump for the\nAscension hot spot is much smaller than that suggested by\nequation (20a), implying that the actual qmax is larger than we\nhave inferred. The hot spots show general agreement with the\ntrend predicted by equation (20b), suggesting that our models\ncapture the major processes involved in ridge jumps (i.e.,\nlithospheric weakening) and that other processes including\npostrift ridge propagation are short relative to tjump.\n[40] Figure 8 shows the relationship between observed\nvalues of Urate at the time of a ridge jump and tage for 14\ndocumented ridge jumps. Also shown are a set of theoretical\ncurves based on the model results (equation (19)) of the\nFigure 8. Observed half spreading rates and age of the lithosphere where jumps occurred tage are shown\n(black circles) for several locations including the Ascension hot spot (Asc), the Galapagos hot spot (Gal),\nIceland (Ice), the Kerguelen hot spot (Ker), the Kolbeinsey Ridge (Kol), the Louisville hot spot (Lou), and\nShatsky Rise (Sha). Bars show the estimated observation error. When no error bars are present, errors are\neither smaller than the symbol or unknown. Curves for different maximum heating rates qmax (units are in\nkJ m\u22123 s\u22121) are from equations (20a) and (20b). Ridge jumps are predicted to occur below any one curve\nfor a given qmax. Data are from Breivik et al. [2006], Brozena and White [1990], Desa et al. [2006], G\u00e9li\net al. [1998], Hardarson et al. [1997], Krishna et al. [1995], Krishna and Rao [2000], LaFemina et al.\n[2005], Mjelde et al. [2008], Nakanishi et al. [1999], S\u00e6mundsson [1974], Small [1995], and Wilson and\nHey [1995].\nMITTELSTAEDT ET AL.: REPEAT RIDGE JUMPS B01102B01102\n13 of 20\nmaximum tage and Urate to initiate a ridge jump (jumps are\npredicted to occur below, not above, the curves) at a given\nvalue of qmax. Observed values of Urate and tage are from the\nreferences in Figure 8 or are estimated using published\nmagnetic anomalies with error bars based on anomaly width.\nFor the special case of the jump from the extinct Aegir Ridge\ntoward the Iceland hot spot into continental lithosphere to\nform the Kolbeinsey ridge (Kol, Figure 8), the value of tage is\ntaken as the equivalent age of oceanic lithosphere with the\nsame depth\u2010integrated yield strength. This yield strength was\ncalculated with the thermal, lithological, and rheological\nparameters ofMjelde et al. [2008] at 45Ma with an estimated\nlithosphere\u2010asthenosphere boundary depth of 30\u201340 km.\nLarge error bars in Figure 8 reflect the uncertainty of the\nassumptions used here for Kolbeinsey. The theoretical curves\npredict ridge jumps to be restricted to younger plate ages for\nlarger values of spreading rate (for a given value of qmax). At\na given spreading rate, the theoretical minimum value of\nqmax is smaller for jumps to younger seafloor. The curves\nillustrate the model predictions that ridge jumps are favored\nat younger seafloor and jumps to older seafloor require\nlarge magma fluxes or slow spreading rates.\n[41] Indeed, although the data likely represent a range of\npoorly constrained values of qmax and specific tectonic\nenvironments in detail, the above locations show a general\ndecrease in the observed tage for larger values of spreading\nrate, which is consistent with the trends of the theoretical\ncurves. The favorability of jumps to young seafloor is also\nreflected by 11 of the 14 jumps occurring in seafloor \u22643 Myr\nold. Of jumps that occur to seafloor older than 3 Myr, the\nmost recent jump at Iceland and the jump from the extinct\nAegir ridge to the Kolbeinsey ridge (\u201cIce\u201d and \u201cKol,\u201d\nFigure 8) both occurred in very slowly moving lithosphere\n(half spreading rates \u226410 km Myr\u22121). The remaining large\njump along the Ninety\u2010East Ridge into \u223c8 Myr old seafloor\n[Krishna and Rao, 2000] appears to require an unusually\nlarge magmatic heating rate compared to other cases.\n4.2. Repeat Ridge Jumps\n[42] At many locations including Iceland since \u223c16 Ma\n[Hardarson et al., 1997; J\u00f3hannesson, 1980], Shatsky Rise\n[Nakanishi et al., 1999], and along the Ninety\u2010East Ridge\n[Desa et al., 2006; Krishna et al., 1995; Krishna and Rao,\n2000], proximal ridge segments often jump repeatedly\ntoward the hot spot as the rest of the plate boundary migrates\naway from the hot spot. Alternatively, the hot spot might\ncapture a ridge segment through asymmetric spreading, such\nas at the Galapagos between \u223c5 and \u223c2.5 Ma during which\nthe ridge remained fixed with the hot spot without resolvable\ndiscrete ridge jumps [Hey, 1977; Wilson and Hey, 1995].\nFinally, the hot spot and ridge can separate without a jump\nas has occurred at the Galapagos since \u223c2.5 Ma [Wilson and\nHey, 1995]. While such observations are widely docu-\nmented, the mechanisms controlling ridge jumps are not.\n[43] Our models predict that it is the dynamic evolution of\nmagma flux through and corresponding heating of the lith-\nosphere that is the primary process leading to repeat jumps.\nWithout magma transport calculations, the models of\nMittelstaedt et al. [2008] predicted a jump to capture the\nridge and cause it to migrate steadily with the heating zone,\nwithout any repeat ridge jumps. With magma transport\ncalculations, however, repeat ridge jumps are predicted. The\nkey is the separation of the plume away from the ridge axis\nand the development of a new off\u2010axis peak in magma flux\nafter the previously sloping solidus, shoals and flattens\nabove the plume. Thus, with a more\u2010or\u2010less steady rate of\nmelt production by the plume and a steadily migrating ridge,\nour models predict an ever changing melt transport system\nwith punctuated changes in ridge geometry.\n[44] In Figure 6, model predictions of the inferred mini-\nmum qmax to jump (Figure 5b) and observationally con-\nstrained values of Qcool\/Zlith and Urate \u2212 Umig are used to plot\na set of natural hot spot\u2013ridge systems where repeat ridge\njumps are observed: Ascension, Iceland, and the Galapagos.\nThe value of Urate \u2212 Umig for each system is determined\nfrom the references in the caption of Figure 6. A variation of\n\u00b110% of the published spreading rates is imposed (Table 2).\nThe estimates of Umig and Urate for Ascension are modern\nvalues [Brozena and White, 1990], those from Iceland are\nfrom 11 Ma [Jones, 2003] and three values of Urate are used\nfor the Galapagos, one at 10 Ma, a second at 4 Ma, and the\nthird from the present (i.e., 0 Ma) [Wilson and Hey, 1995].\nThe three values used for the Galapagos correspond to\nobserved repeat jumps (10 Ma), ridge capture (4 Ma), and\nno jumps (since \u223c2.5 Ma) [Wilson and Hey, 1995]. The\nvalues of qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) predicted for Ascension, Iceland,\nand the Galapagos (at 10 Ma) all fall within the range of\nrepeat jumps, in agreement with observations.\n[45] For the Galapagos at 4 Ma when the ridge was\napparently captured, the inferred value of qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) is\nsmaller than predicted for this behavior. This result is con-\nsistent with the actual qmax being larger than we have\ninferred from equation (19) (up arrow in Figure 6a), which\nagain describes the minimum value required for a jump. At\npresent\u2010day Galapagos (Gal0), which we consider to be\nwithout a ridge jump, the inferred qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith) appears\nto be larger than predicted for no jumps. This result implies\nthe actual qmax being less than that inferred (down arrow\nFigure 6a). Thus, the changing behavior at the Galapagos\nhot spot implies an increase in magmatic heating between\n\u223c10 Ma and \u223c5 Ma (shift from repeat jumps to ridge cap-\nture) and a decrease in magmatic heating at \u223c2.5 Ma (shift\nfrom ridge capture to no jumps). This evolution is similar to\nchanges in estimated magma volume flux at the Galapagos\nIslands over the past \u223c8 Myr (Figure 6b) [Ito et al., 1997].\n4.3. Ridge Jumps and the Location of Ridges\nRelative to Hot Spots\n[46] A recent study by Jellinek et al. [2003] noted that hot\nspots not associated with the Pacific and African super-\nplumes are commonly clustered within \u223c1000 km of slow\nspreading, but not fast spreading ridges. They suggested that\noff\u2010axis hot spot formation is inhibited by plume material\nbeing drawn into the corner flow at fast spreading ridges but\nnot at slow spreading ridges. Another possible reason for hot\nspots to be located near slow spreading ridges is the capture\nof a ridge by a mantle plume through repeat ridge jumps and\nasymmetric spreading. Ridge jumps are predicted to be\npromoted by slow spreading rates (equation (20a) and\nFigures 5c and 8). In addition, as a ridge and plume separate,\nunder certain model conditions, the ridge is predicted to\nremain near the plume for long periods of time. Over time,\nrepeat ridge jumps result in asymmetric accretion as\nobserved near many hot spots [M\u00fcller et al., 1998, 2001]\nMITTELSTAEDT ET AL.: REPEAT RIDGE JUMPS B01102B01102\n14 of 20\nand could well explain the distribution of hot spots and\nridges today.\n4.4. Intraplate Hot Spots: Contribution of Magmatic\nHeating to Plate Thinning\n[47] Magmatic heating in the model predicts appreciable\namounts of lithospheric thinning above a plume, ranging from\nmaximal thinning to cause a ridge jump, to broad regions of\nmore subdued thinning. Such thinning is likely to contribute, at\nleast locally, to elevating the hot spot swell. These predictions\nare consistent with recent seismic observations that suggest\nthe lithosphere beneath the Hawaiian islands thins from \u223c100\u2013\n110 km beneath the island of Hawaii (normal 90Myr old plate\nthicknesses) to \u223c50\u201360 km beneath Oahu and Kauai, \u223c500 km\ndownstream [Li et al., 2004]. Previously suggested mechan-\nisms for plume\u2010induced thinning of the Hawaiian lithosphere\ninclude conductive heating of the plate by the warm plume\nmaterial, small\u2010scale convection, and solid\u2010state lithospheric\nerosion [Detrick andCrough, 1978; Li et al., 2004;Moore et al.,\n1998; Ribe and Christensen, 1994]. Heating of a plate by\nmagma as it penetrates the lithosphere provides another mech-\nanism for lithospheric thinning above the Hawaiian plume\nand at other intraplate hot spots.\n5. Conclusions\n[48] We explore the combined effects of plume\u2010lithosphere\ninteraction and magmatic heating of the lithosphere on the\ninitiation of ridge jumps. We use a 2\u2010Dmodel of viscoplastic\nmantle flow with a strain\u2010history\u2010dependent yield criteria\ncoupled to a model of melting and melt transport, which is\nused to compute heating of the lithosphere where magma\npasses through it. The melt transport equations simulate the\naverage flow of melt in a channel of high porosity at the\nsolidus, just beneath the lithosphere. The ability of magma to\nreach the seafloor depends on a balance between the melt\npressure at the solidus, the strength of the lithosphere, and the\naccumulated magmatic damage of the lithosphere. Calcula-\ntions predict a dynamic focusing of magma penetrating and\nheating the lithosphere over widths (\u223c10\u201320 km) comparable\nto the width of the neovolcanic zone at manymid\u2010ocean ridges\n[e.g., Karsten et al., 1986] and the widths of hot spot islands.\nThis focusing of magmatism is critical for ridge jumps to\noccur and is predicted to be caused by a positive feedback\nbetween local shoaling of the solidus associated with litho-\nspheric thinning, increased flow of melt toward the locally\nshallow solidus, and accumulation of magmatic damage.\n[49] Model results show that the time to a ridge jump\ndecreases for larger values of the magmatic heating rate and\nspreading rate, and smaller values of plate age. The inverse\nrelationship with spreading rate is due to increased melt\ntransport velocities up a steeper solidus slope; ridgeward\nmelt transport is faster beneath slower spreading lithosphere\nbecause of its larger slope, leading to a greater on\u2010axis but\nsmaller off\u2010axis heating rate (i.e., larger tjump). A hot, plume\u2010\nlike upwelling introduces competing effects. Although larger\nplume excess temperatures inhibit ridge jumps by weakening\nthe ridge axis, the dominant effect is to promote jumps by\nincreasing melt supply off axis. Ridge jumps are also pro-\nmoted by increases in the volume flux of the plume due to\nboth increases in melt flux and larger shear stresses on the\nbase of the plate.\n[50] Models predict five main behaviors, including repeat\nridge jumps, when ridges migrate relative to plumes due to the\ndynamic interaction between melt transport, lithospheric\nmagma penetration, and the shape of the base of the litho-\nsphere. As the influence of the plume on the ridge axis in-\ncreases, the models predict: no jumps, dueling rifts, single\njumps, repeat ridge jumps and total ridge capture. Plume\ninfluence increases with increasing qmax\/(Qcool\/Zlith), the ratio\nof the maximum magmatic heating rate to the thermal resil-\nience per thickness of lithosphere. A maximum in plume\ninfluence is found for slightly positive values of Urate \u2212 Umig.\nFrom this maximum, plume influence generally decreases\nmore rapidly as Urate \u2212 Umig becomes increasingly negative\nandmore slowly asUrate\u2212Umig becomes increasingly positive.\n[51] Model predictions show favorable agreement with\nobservations at natural plume\u2010ridge systems. Observations at\nAscension, Iceland, Louisville and the Galapagos support\npredicted trends in the timescale of jumps as a function of\nseafloor age to where jumps occur. Our models predict varia-\ntions in the Galapagos hot spot heating rate over the past\n\u223c10 Myr, similar to independent estimates of changes in\nmagma volume flux at the Galapagos Islands. In addition,\nobservations at 14 ridge jumps support the prediction that ridge\njumps are promoted on slower, younger seafloor.Model results\nalso suggest that magmatic heating of the lithosphere is a\npotential mechanism for lithospheric thinning above intraplate\nhot spots such as Hawaii. Finally, the process of repeat ridge\njumps and ridge capture might explain the observed clustering\nof hot spots near the slow spreading Mid\u2010Atlantic Ridge.\nAppendix A\nA1.

Simplified Equations for Transport in the\nMantle and a High\u2010Porosity Channel Beneath\nthe Lithosphere\n[53] The location and magnitude of magma flow rate\nthrough the lithosphere (i.e., out of the mantle) is calculated by\nusing a set of simplified equations of melt flow through, along,\nand across the top of the melting zone (i.e., the solidus). The\nsimplification that pressure gradients associated with matrix\nshear and compaction are negligible compared to that associ-\nated with melt buoyancy (i.e., the zero compaction length\napproximation), allows the two momentum equations (A3)\nand (A4) to be solved separately and is a reasonable approxi-\nmation for mantle viscosities \u2264\u223c1019 Pa s [Spiegelman, 1993].\nThus in the low\u2010viscosity melting zone, melt rises vertically,\nand at the very top of the melting zone migrates in a high\u2010\nporosity channel parallel to the impermeable freezing bound-\nary at the solidus, just below the lithosphere [Sparks and\nParmentier, 1994; Spiegelman, 1993].\n[54] Melt flow in the sublithospheric channel is described\nusing a Cartesian coordinate system in which x is parallel to\nand z is perpendicular to the average slope of the solidus.

Following Hieronymus and Bercovici\n[2001], we assume that an incremental change in F is con-\ntrolled by incremental changes in the excess melt pressure at\nthe base of the lithosphere sp and damage \" (generally due to\nchemical, physical, and thermal processes) of the lithosphere\ncaused by magma passing through it:\nCdF \u00bc d\u0005p \u00fe L0d\"; \u00f0A13\u00de\nwhere L0 is a constant and C is defined such that the\nporosities in the lithosphere vary between 0 and the maxi-\nmum allowable porosity, Fmax,\nC \u00bc C0\nF Fmax \u0002 F\u00f0 \u00de : \u00f0A14\u00de\nSubstituting (A14) into (A13) and integrating yields an\nequation for lithospheric porosity,\nF \u00bc Fmax\n2\n1\u00fe tanh A0\u0004 cos \u0003\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 \u0005c \u00fe L0H\n2C0=Fmax\n\u0001 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\n: \u00f0A15\u00de\nThus, F is controlled by the balance between the melt\ndriving pressure from the high\u2010porosity channel sp =\nA0\u0004cos(\u0003), the intrinsic (constant) strength of the lithosphere\nsc, and the damage associated with erosion of the litho-\nsphere as magma passes through it L0H, where H is a\nfraction of the time\u2010integrated melt flux (see below). Lith-\nosphere porosity F increases in response to a combination of\nincreasing melt pressures and time\u2010integrated magmatic\ndamage (\u223cH).\n[58] The value of H evolves according to the following\ndimensional advection equation:\n@H\n@t\n\u00bc wlith \u0002 @ HUrate\u00f0 \u00de\n@X\n\u0002 S\nH \u00fe H0\u00f0 \u00de2\n; \u00f0A16\u00de\nwhere Urate is the speed of the overlying lithosphere and X is\nhorizontal distance in the absolute reference frame (i.e., not\nalong the solidus). The second term on the right\u2010hand side\ndescribes advection due to plate motion and the last term\ndescribes healing of damage. Without the last two terms, H\nwould equal\nR\nwlithdt, the total thickness of magma that pen-\netrated a given section of lithosphere. The healing rate (last\nterm) is assumed to be proportional to the conductive cooling\nrate; the pertinent width scale DX for temperature variations\nin the zone ofmagma penetration is proportional to howmuch\nmagma has passed through it H. Consequently,\nhealing rate \/ \u0002 @T\n@t\n\/ @\n2T\n@X 2\n\/ DX\u00022 \/ H\u00022 \u00f0A17a\u00de\nand therefore\nhealing rate \u0005 S\nH \u00fe H0\u00f0 \u00de2\n; \u00f0A17b\u00de\nwhere S and H0 are constants. Equation (A17) yields greater\nhealing rates for smaller integrated magma fluxes and a\nmaximum healing rate of S\/H0\n2,which is effectively the min-\nimum magma penetration rate needed to create new damage\n(i.e., wlith \u2212 S\/H02 > 0 in (A16)) and thus increase porosity\n(equation (A15)).\n[59] The porosity equation (A15) is expressed terms of\ndimensionless parameters using H0 and the (sublithospheric)\npressure scale A080:\nF \u00bc Fmax\n2\n1\u00fe tanh \u0004\u2032 cos \u0003\u0002 \u0005c\u2032\u00fe L0\u2032H \u2032\nD\u2032\n\u0001 \u0003\u0004 \u0005\n; \u00f0A18\u00de\nwhere s\u2032c = sc\/(A0\u00040), L\u20320 = H0L0\/(A0\u00040), H\u2032 = H\/H0, and\nD\u2032 = 2C0\/(FmaxA0\u00040). The corresponding dimensionless\nform of the equation for lithospheric melt penetration\nrate (A9) is\nwlith\u2032 \u00bc\nwlith\nwl0\n\u00bc cos \u0003 1\u00fe tanh \u0004\u2032 cos \u0003\nD\u2032\n\u0002 \u0005c\u2032\nD\u2032\n\u00fe L0\u2032H \u2032\nD\u2032\n\u0001 \u0003\u0004 \u0005n\n: \u00f0A19\u00de\nEquation (A19) states that the melt penetration rate is con-\ntrolled by the balance between the scaled porosity \u0004\u2032 in the\nsublithospheric channel, the scaled strength of the litho-\nsphere s\u2032c, and the effect of magmatic damage L\u20320H\u2032. Pene-\ntration rate w\u2032lith varies from 0 to its maximum value of\n4cos(\u0003) (for n = 2).\n[60] In summary, the three equations governing melt\ntransport are (A12), (A16) and (A19). Transport in the\nsublithospheric channel (A12) is controlled by two input\nparameters: wl0\/wm0 and Pe; the other two equations\ndescribing lithosphere penetration by magma require four\ninput parameters: S, D\u2032, s\u2032c, and L\u20320. Numerically, the diffu-\nsion term in (A12) is treated with centered differencing\nand the advective terms by upwind differencing. In (A12)\nand (A16), time is advanced using a first\u2010order, explicit,\nEuler scheme with a time step \u226450% of the Courant limit.\nA2. Benchmarks With Analytical Solutions\n[61] To verify the numerical solutions, we compare them\nto some simple, steady state (\u2202\u0004\u2032\/\u2202t\u2032 = 0.0) analytical solu-\ntions which neglect either the terms associated with gra-\ndients in porosity (i.e., Pe = large) or the terms accounting\nfor the slope of the solidus (i.e., Pe = 0.0). All cases are\nshown in Figure A1 with RMS values of the difference\nbetween the numerical and analytical solution divided by\nthe maximum porosity of the analytical solutions.\nA2.1. Flat Lithosphere, Uniform Melt Flux From\nBelow (Pe = 0.0, w\u2032lith = 0.0, q = 0.0)\n[62] The first case is that of a horizontal solidus that is\neverywhere impermeable to melt with a uniform melt flux\nfrom below. The Pecl\u00e9t number is set to 0 so flow is con-\ntrolled only by gradients in porosity (A12). Scaled porosity\n\u0004\u2032 is maintained at zero on both the left and right hand sides\nof the domain (width L\u2032 = 100). The analytical solution of\n(A12) is\n\u0004\u2032 \u00bc n\u00fe 1\u00f0 \u00de \u0002wmantle\u2032 X \u2032\n2\n2\n\u00fe wmantle\u2032 L\u2032\n2\nX \u2032\n\u0004 \u0005\u000b \f1= n\u00fe1\u00f0 \u00de\n; \u00f0A20\u00de\nMITTELSTAEDT ET AL.: REPEAT RIDGE JUMPS B01102B01102\n17 of 20\nwhere the uniform melt flux from below w\u2032mantle (= 1.0 \u00d7\n10\u22122) is balanced by the melt flux out the sides of the\ndomain at x\u2032 = 0 and x\u2032 = 100. Comparing this solution to the\nnumerical method for n = 1, 2, and 3 results in a very close\nmatches with RMS error \u22640.016.\nA2.2. Flat Lithosphere With Fixed Melt Sources\n(Pe = 0.0, \u2202f\u2032\/\u2202X\u2032 = 0.0125 at x\u2032 = 0, q = 0.0)\n[63] The second analytical solution is similar to that in\nsection A2.1, but instead of restricting \u0004\u2032 to 0 on the left\u2010\nhand boundary, a porosity flux of Q\u2032 ( = \u2202\u0004\u2032\/\u2202X\u2032 = 0.0125) is\nimposed.

Sloped Lithosphere Without Diffusion\n(Pe = 100, w\u2032lith = 0.0, q = 10\u00b0)\n[64] When Pe is large, the diffusion term in A12 can be\nneglected and the analytical solution for buoyant melt\ntraveling up a sloping lithosphere is straightforward. Solving\nthe resulting first\u2010order differential equation with the\nboundary condition of \u0004\u2032 = 0.0 on the right\u2010hand side of the\ndomain yields\n\u0004\u2032 \u00bc \u0002nwmantle\u2032\nPe sin \u0003\u00f0 \u00de X \u2032\u0002 L\u2032\u00f0 \u00de\n\u0004 \u00051=n\n: \u00f0A22\u00de\nComparison with a numerical solution where melt is allowed\nto flow out of the left boundary and porosity is 0 on the right\nedge for n = 1, 2, and 3 and w\u2032mantle\/Pe = 1 \u00d7 10\n\u22124 results in\nRMS errors < 0.0050.\n[65] Acknowledgments.
