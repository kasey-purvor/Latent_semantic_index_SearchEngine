In particular it is shown that there is a simultaneous etch deposition process \nwhich takes place, and that the dc bias can be used to control this etch rate, and hence the \nnet film growth rate. When a balance between etching and deposition is achieved, the \nfilms show increased residual stress and optical density with exposure to Ar + bombardment \nin the plasma. In addition to the measured dc bias the local electric field developed \naround the substrate is also found to significantly influence the energy with which ions impinge \nupon the growing film. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThe properties of wide band gap, low dielectric con- \nstant, high intrinsic electrical resistivity, high-carrier mo- \nbility, high thermal conduction, and chemical inertness \nmake diamond an attractive material for electronic devices \nwhich are to operate in hostile environments.\u2019 In addition \nits extreme hardness and optical transparency make it at- \ntractive in a host of coating applications.2\u20193 The recently \ndiscovered possibility of depositing polycrystalline dia- \nmond films on different substrate materials has made the \nprospect of realizing the technological potential of dia- \nmond more realistic. \nDiamond films can be deposited using a variety of \nplasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD ) \ntechniques. These include plasmas formed by coupling dc, \nrf, or microwave electric fields to a gas mixture which \ncontains CH, with either Hz or Ar.~ In this paper we con- \ncentrate on films formed from a CHJAr rf plasma. The rf \nPECVD technique has the advantages of being a low-tem- \nperature process where substrates are commonly held at \n20 \u201cC and easily extendable for large area deposition. The \nmajor disadvantage is that the films obtained from a \nCHd\/Ar rf plasma are not comprised entirely of diamond \ngrains, but rather diamond grains within an a:C matrix and \nis therefore a mixed phase material.4 This material is there- \nfore more accurately described as carbon-diamond as op- \nposed to diamond or diamond-like carbon. Transmission \nelectron microscope (TEM) shows the diamond grains in \ncarbon-diamond films to range from 10 to 200 nm.4 Sur- \nface microanalysis carried out using scanning tunnelling \nmicroscopy (STM) also confirm the diamond--a:C mixed \nphase nature of the films.5 Scanning electron microscope \n(SEM) examination of carbon-diamond film surface shows \nit to be very smooth and free of pin holes or surface cracks. \nSurface roughness measurements using a profilometer re- \nveal that features of 5-10 nm over scan lengths of several \ncentimeters can be obtained for some films. This mirror \nquality of surface smoothness, which can be obtained in \nrf-deposited carbon-diamond films, is directly related to \nthe small diamond grain size in the films. The more pure \ndiamond films obtained from microwave PECVD typically \nhave grain sizes of 1 to 10 ,um and do not result in such \nsmooth surfaces. It is interesting to note that attempts to \nreduce the grain size and improve surface smoothness in \nmicrowave PECVD diamond films for x-ray lithography \nalso led to a degradation in the purity of the fihns6 \nIn this work emphasis is placed on how the mechanical \nand optical properties of rf-deposited carbon-diamond \nfilms change as a function of the plasma-substrate dc self \nbias voltage and substrate surface area. In particular the \nvariation of refractive index and stress in the films is char- \nacterized. The optical absorption characteristics of the \nfilms are also discussed briefly. \nII. EXPERIMENT \nThe carbon-diamond films were deposited in a capac- \nitatively coupled 13.56MHz rf deposition chamber at a \npressure of 300 mT. A gas flow of 160 \u2018seem was used with \nan 8% CH4 mixture in Ar. Substrate material was { loo), \nl-5 fi cm n-type Si. The dc self bias which accelerates the \nions taking part in film growth was controlled by varying rf \npower input to the chamber. In this system the sample is \nplaced on the bottom electrode which is electrically driven \nand cooled to 20 \u201cC. The dc bias voltage, deposition time \nand substrate surface area were used as variable parame- \nters. \nAllsubstrates were subjected to an in situ preclean in \nan Ar plasma with dc self bias of - 450 V. It was found \nthat this precleaning procedure had to be carefully deter- \nmined as it has the potential to cause significant damage at \nthe Si surface, and hence the carbon-diamond\/Si interface. \nFigure 1 shows how the preclean procedure affects the \n5374 J.

Compared to the case \nwith no plasma preclean (but with dkgreasing), both di- \nodes on precleaned substrates show signs of additional de- \nfects being introduced at the Au\/Si interface. However, the \nsample precleaned for 30 s still -preserves rectifying char- \nacteristics but with an increase in the junction resistance (a \nlarge ideality factor). The sample subjected to a 5-min \npreclean shows a loss in rectifying characteristics and an \nincrease in the forward resistance, consistent:with the pres- \nence of an excess number of defects at the Au\/Si interface. \nFilm thickness was determined using a Gaertner ellip- \nsometer. The film thicknesses predicted by ellipsometry \nwere calibrated against measurements from a Dektak 3030 \nprofilometer. Refractive indices (ri) of the films were also \nobtained by ellipsometry. Film stress was obtained by mea- \nsuring substrate curvature before and after deposition. Car- \nbon-diamond films of up to 600 A in thickness were trans- \nparent, those in the thickness range 700-1200 w yellow \nand those thicker than 1200 A a mixed blue-green and \nviolet in color. \nFigure 2(a) shows a typical infrared (IR) transmis- \nsion spectrum for the carbon-diamond films, and is a useful \nway of characterizing the amorphous carbon present in the \nfilms. The films are transparent over a major part of the IR \nspectrum showing the most absorption below 1100 cm - * \n( > 9 pm) in the far infrared. The gradual slope in the \ncharacteristic with reducing wave number down to 1200 \ncm -I is introduced in the process of subtracting the Si \nsubstrate background from the composite IR spectrum. \nThis type of IR spectrum is different from those reported \nfor a-C, a-C:H, and diamond-like carbon7-9 in that it shows \nsignificant absorption in the 3400-3100 cm - \u2019 region, \nrather than 3100-2800 cm =- * normally associated with \nmonohydride C-H bonds. In the literature concerning IR \nstudies of carbon films there is no report of the very dis- \ntinct absorption peak (transmission trough) at 3225 cm - \u2019 \nobserved in these films.

The limited absorption above 4.1 eV and below 5.4 \neV suggests that the density of states between these two \nenergies are limited.

Growth rate \nFigure 5 shows film thickness versus deposition time as \na function of dc bias voltage. The substrate surface dimen- \nsions were 30 mm~20 mm. This data gives some insight \ninto the rf PECVD process for carbon-diamond. For the \nfilms deposited at a dc bias of - 450 V it is seen that after \nan initial step deposition of 100 A in 30 s, the net deposi- \ntion for the next 45 min is 70 A. By contrast the films \ndeposited at - 160 V dc bias grow at a constant rate of 70 \nli\/min over the entire 45 min. The films deposited at dc \nbiases of - 320 V and - 400 V show continued Elm \ngrowth, but with changes in growth rate for the - 400 V \n3500 -- fLc-d_L_I_LL_I__(- L  ,--I -A~ I -1 ~I I 1  I t I \nA L  \n3000 \n2500 \n2000 \nIS00 \nIO00 \n500 \n0 \nI \n, ,\u2019 I I , \n\u2018(\u2019 1 \nf ,\u2019 \/ ,.d \/ I \/ \n20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 \nTime \/ mins. \n5376 J.

This leads us to view \nCI&\/Ar rf PECVD as an etch\/deposition process, and \nthat a balance between the two competing processes com- \nponents can be achieved by changing the dc bias voltage. \nThis was further conErmed by exposing carbon-diamond \nElms to a pure Ar + plasma and measuring Elm thickness \nwith time. Figure 6 shows thickness vs time for a carbon- \ndiamond Elm which was initially 560 w thick (deposited at \na dc bias of - 400 V) exposed to an Ar + plasma at - 400 \nV dc bias (flow rate 20 seem, pressure 30 mT). The much \nfaster etch rate seen in Fig. 6, 10 A \/s, compared to the \ncorresponding film deposition rate of approximately 50 A\/ \nmin in Fig. 5, indicates that Ar plays a significant role in \netching the growing carbon-diamond Elms. \nIt should be noted that while Ar + ions etch the grow- \ning Elms, the dc bias which influences Ar + acceleration \nacross the sheath space, and hence the sputter efficiency, is \nproportional to the rf power coupled into the chamber at a \ngiven pressure. Therefore a higher proportion of Ar atoms \nin the chamber will also be ionized with increasing rf \npower and dc bias voltage. Changes in both the dc bias \nvoltage and ionized Ar concentration will therefore influ- \nence the etch rate of the carbon-diamond Elm during dep- \nosition. \n6. Refractive index and stress \nIf we now consider the film which was deposited at a \ndc bias - 450 V in Fig. 5 and note that virtually no growth \ntakes place after 15 min: It is reasonable to conclude that \nan etch\/deposition balance has been achieved. During this \n\u201cno growth\u201d period the Elm-can be viewed as being sub- \njected to Ar + bombardment. Figure 7(a) shows the vari- \nation of refractive index (ri) with time as a function of dc \nbias voltage for the same Elms as those in Fig. 5. Figure \n7(b) shows the variation of ri with thickness for the same \nfilms. For the film deposited at - 450 V dc bias it is seen \nthat the ri increases with time durhig the no growth period. \nThis increase in the effective optical density of the Elm is \nconsistent with the compacting of the Elm and a rise in Elm \nstress due to Ar * bombardment. Figure 8 shows measure- \nments of carbon-diamond Elms stress as a function of ri \nwhich are consistent with the view that Ar + bombard- \nment leads to increased Elm stress during the no growth \nperiod. It is interesting to note that Elm stress values above \n2 GPa correspond to hydrostatic pressures at which dia- \nmond is the stable phase of carbon at room temperature. \nThe significance of such high Elm stresses in determining \nthe transition from graphitic amorphous carbon to amor- \nphous diamond in ion beam deposited Elms has been ex- \nperimentally verified recently. K+S \nFrom Fig. 5 it can be seen that the Elm deposited at a \ndc bias of - 400 V shows a growth rate of approximately \n50 u min up to 30 min, after which it drops to 20 A\/min. \nFrom Fig. 7(a), which shows the corresponding ri data, it \nis seen that after an initial rapid rise to a value of 2.1, it \nstays at this value up until 30-min deposition time. After \nthis an increase in the ri which is accompanied by a fall in \nthe growth is seen. This suggests that during the slow \n5377 J. Appl.

Thickness vs substrate deposition area. \nsition to a balance between etching and deposition at a \nparticular film thickness, and that the thickness at which \nthis transition occurs is a function of the dc bias. After this \nbalance has been achieved the films are subjected to com- \npaction or densification by Ar \u2019 bombardment which leads \nto an increase in film stress and ri. The absence of growth \nrate fall off in the films deposited at - 320 and - 160 V \ndc bias show that the etch\/deposition balance thickness \nhas not been reached after 45 min of deposition. The ri \ndata shows that for the - 160 V dc bias case there is a \nrapid rise to a value of 2.1, after which it increases more \nslowly to a value of 2.5-2.6. This is to be expected as even \nthough the Glrn is growing at a constant rate without sig- \nnificant compaction, the stress in the film can increase as it \ngrows. The rapid initial rise in ri from 1.5 to 2.1 is consis- \ntent with the initial film being more amorphous (typical ri \nof a:C 1.8-2.0),* and an increasing diamond (ri of 2.4) or \ndiamond-like content .in the film growing on this initial \nfilm. For films deposited at - 320 and - 160 V it was \nfound that before an etch\/deposition balance was reached \nthe films delaminated due to the stored energy in the \nthicker films. under high compressive stress. At these dc \nbiases it was possible to continue deposition with constant \ngrowth rates for up to 70 min without delamination taking \nplace. \nC. Substrate surface area \n4 substrate surface area dependence on the* growth \nrate, ri and stress in the films has also been observed. Fig- \nures 9 and 10 show the variation of thickness and ri with \nvarying substrate area, respectively. The deposition param- \neters were identical for all substrates, dc bias was main- \ntained at - 450 V, and deposition time was 30 min. The \narea unit of 1 corresponds to the surface area of a 75-mm- \ndiam Si wafer. As can be seen from the data in Fig. 9 the \nfilm thickness, and hence growth rate, increases with sur- \nface area. Taken together with the ri and stress data in \nFigs. 10 and 8, it demonstrates that the effective dc bias \nunder which the deposition takes place is influenced by the \n5378 J. Appi.

Comparing this data with the data \nin Figs. 5 and 7 where the substrate area is constant and \nthe dc bias varies, it is seen that larger surface area has the \nsame effect as reducing the dc bias.

Si substrates (di- \nelectric constant 11.9) of varying length were placed on the \n\u201clower electrode.\u201d This was held at - 450 V, with the \n\u201cupper electrode\u201d earthed. Figures 11 (a), 11 (b), and \n11 (c) show contours of constant electric field in mV\/pm \nfor these Si substrates. It can be seen that the electric field \nacross the surface area of the smallest substrate is compa- \nrable to those fields that are present at the edges of the \nlarger substrates. This effect is also seen experimentally as \na variation in the color of the interference fringes from the \nedge of the substrate to the middle, for films thicker than \n0.4 pm. \nPlacing of the Si substrate on the driven electrode gives \nrise to larger local electric fields as the substrate edges. For \nsmall substrates the ions accelerated by this high edge elec- \ntric field can take part in film growth over the entire sur- \nface. However, for large substrates the high edge fields will \nonly intluence film growth around the edges and the bulk \nof the surface will appear an extension of the underlying \nelectrode. Therefore the effective dc bias under which \ngrowth takes place will be significantly larger for smaller \nsubstrate areas. \nFrom the thickness data of Fig. 9 a critical substrate \nsurface area of 10 cm2 can be obtained. This is the sub- \nstrate surface area below which edge effects dominate. This \nhas implications for extension of the rf PECVD carbon- \ndiamond process for large area coatings of films.

CONCLUSIONS \nThe rf PECVD of carbon-diamond films from a \nCHQ\u2019Ar plasma is shown to be a combined etch\/ \ndeposition process. The key parameter which influences \nthe etch, and hence deposition rate is the effective dc self \nbias between the substrate and the plasma. As the film \ngrows a balance in the etch\/deposition process can be \nachieved so that net film growth stops. The film thickness \nat which such a balance is achieved is also determined by \nthe dc bias. Once film growth stops the film is subjected to \ncompaction or densification by ion bombardment. This \ngives rise to an increase in film stress and refractive index. \nData which show that the effective dc bias between the \nsubstrate and the plasma is a function of substrate surface \narea is also presented. These results suggest that local edge \nelectric field effects determine the effective dc bias of small \nsubstrates. \ni K. Shenai, R. S. Scott, and B. J. Baliga, IEEE Trans Electron.
