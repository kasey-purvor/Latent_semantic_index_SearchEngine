It is particularly important that the consortium\naddresses the issue of embedding change within organizations if it is to succeed in its aims.\nHowever, as Brown (1998) has noted, the integration of learning and teaching innovation\ninto the broader fabric of an institution, by projects with a fixed remit and life cycle, is\nproblematic. Here we will investigate how the Chic project has related evaluation outcomes\nto disciplinary pedagogical imperatives in order to foster a greater sense of purpose and\ncohesion towards the project and its objectives. This recognizes the value of evaluation in\n19\nRichard Hall and Derek Harding Driving departmental change through evaluation: some outcomes and problems\naffecting the context of learning, through the iteration of teaching techniques and resource\nprovision. The resultant implications for institutions, and the barriers to change, need to be\nexamined in the light of the pedagogical context of the history discipline. Whilst accepting\nthe premise that change needs to be placed in the context of institutional policy (Hart,\nRyan and Bagdon, 1999; Li and Kaye, 1999), this paper will show how a culture of change\ncan be promoted within departments.\nRelating evaluation to pedagogy\nPedagogical context\nThe project's primary aim is to develop and disseminate distinctive pedagogies, through the\nproduction of context-specific case studies, to support the use of existing TLTP\ncourseware and other learning-technology-based materials within the mainstream history\ncurriculum of UK higher education. These pedagogies should enhance the quality of\nstudent learning beyond what might be achieved solely by the use of traditional teaching\nmethods.\nTo date, apart from the History 2000 project (Fund for the Development of Teaching and\nLearning, project 20\/96), little cohesive research has been undertaken into the learning and\nteaching of history at undergraduate level. History 2000 has taken an enlightened\napproach to the development of learning and teaching within the discipline, noting that 'C\n& IT-related work should be one important thread in a multi-stranded and co-ordinated\nstrategy for developing learning and teaching as a whole'. Moreover, it states that there is a\nneed for 'examples of how C & IT can be embedded in current structures and modes of\nteaching and learning' (History 2000 Response to the HEFCE Circular Letter 36\/98,1998).\nIn order to assess and address the factors which affect pedagogy, and to promote the active\nengagement of students in the practice of history, the Chic project staff need to understand\nhow effective student learning can be hindered and promoted. Measuring the reactions and\nperceptions of students and staff, and mapping these onto departmental imperatives is\ncrucial. To address the concerns of teaching staff and managers, it is important to examine\nwhether the integrated Web-based materials are sufficiently transparent that they promote\ndeep-level learning which then fosters critical reasoning and autonomous self-reflection\nwithin the discipline (Rogers, 1969; Sharp, 1990; Bowden and Marton, 1998). If so, then\ndepartmental change becomes justifiable. Explicitly making the link between pedagogic\ninnovation and educational development, and meaningful evaluation data is vital in raising\nawareness and underpinning departmental change.\nEvaluation context\nThe evaluation of the Chic project has both to address generic learning and teaching issues,\nand to acknowledge the diversity which exists within its seven consortium sites, or sub-\nprojects. The consortium consists of three pre- and three post-1992 universities and one\nuniversity college, all of which have vastly differentiated levels of technical support\navailable. In the 1998-9 session, the evaluations focused on modules with fully- and\npartially-integrated and customized ICT elements. These modules involved between 2 and\n250 level one, two and three students, both part- and full-time, and of all ages.\n20\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nDespite this heterogeneity, one of the main objectives for the first year of the project was to\nestablish a comparable and viable framework for evaluation that would produce\nmeaningful research data. The creation of context-sensitive case studies requires the use of\nthoughtful qualitative methods, which allow one effectively to evaluate and assess the value\nof ICT in the learning and teaching of history, whilst recognizing diversity. A common\ncore of questions and issues has been addressed throughout the consortium, and generic\npro forma information was generated which allows comparisons to be made across types of\nstudent or course.\nHowever, each site has to match its evaluation tools to its specific implementations. The\nkey here is the relevance of the questions or issues raised to student and staff perceptions\nof their local infrastructure, customization and delivery mechanisms, and how these are\nperceived to have affected learning experiences and outcomes. Learning outcomes and\nprocesses will be further analysed through an investigation of assessment scores, by\nobserving student learning patterns in laboratories, by examining student diaries, and\nthrough sensitive interviewing. The triangulation of these mechanisms will allow the\nproject to develop an increasing understanding of possible learning gains in different\ncontexts over its three-year duration.\nClearly, staff resourcing issues affect the levels and types of evaluation data which can be\ncollected. In general, the sub-project co-ordinators managed the local evaluative process,\nalthough module tutors, fully-briefed graduate teaching assistants and the project manager\nalso conducted interviews and observations, ran focus groups and delivered questionnaires.\nIt was considered crucial that the module tutor was seen, by the students and staff, to be\ncommitted to the purpose and process of evaluation, although in some instances it was felt\nthat s\/he was too close to the material effectively to evaluate it, and so an external evaluator\nwas utilized. Table 1 relates the different sites, the module levels where ICT implementa-\ntions were taking place, and the total number of students on those modules, to the\nmethods used to evaluate student perceptions, and the relevant numbers of students\ninvolved in those methods, in the first year of the project.

It has\nalso been iterative and provided a more coherent strategy for the rest of the project's life.\nMoreover, it has allowed each site to generate findings which will feed into future learning\nand teaching plans. Increasing awareness about these evaluations has been fundamental in\nallowing the project to feed directly into departmental strategies.\nKey evaluation findings and their implications for departmental\nchange\nIn order to create a climate where departmental change can flourish it is crucial that the\nsymbiosis between learning and teaching is contextualized. This requires the triangulation\nof staff and student findings in order to illuminate the possibilities for pedagogic\ninnovation, and for the promotion of departmental change.\nThe student experience\nThe student evaluations highlighted several issues that impinged upon learning. These were\nthe need for:\n\u2022 integrated materials;\n\u2022 locally customized resources that provide differentiated learning pathways;\n\u2022 improved access to materials;\n\u2022 relevant tutor-led training.\nGenerally, the students valued an integrated pedagogical approach using a range of\ntraditional and online materials. Second- and third-level students commented upon the\ngreater understanding they gained through primary evidence which 'brought you closer to\nhistory'. This understanding was aided by the fact that locally customized TLTP course-\nware allowed them 'to develop [their] own ideas', and that the range of sources and their\nease-of-comparison 'made one's approach to the sources more flexible'. Clearly,\n22\nALT-) Volume 8 Number \/\ncustomization that matches resources to learning and teaching processes is important in\ngenerating student interest.\nHowever, it is clear that staff need to come to terms more fully with their students' learning\nstyles and contexts. A majority of level-one students, alongside many who were mature\nand\/or part-time, did not see computer-based materials making a positive difference to\ntheir learning. The prior experiences of these learners and the lack of customization for\nspecific modules at certain sites gave these materials the look of any other pre-packaged\nresource to be used or ignored. One first-year noted that the courseware 'contained so\nmuch material that it is very easy to become swamped, and therefore miss the main points\nof the documents'. Students with limited research and critical skills want and need more\ndirection, which focuses the need to align customization to the prior experiences of the\nstudents, and their levels of critical ability. This in turn impinges upon pedagogic\nimperatives.\nSuch imperatives are also affected by access to relevant materials. As has been argued by\nTrathen and Sajeev (1996), there needs to be access from as many sites as possible if any\nstudent's educational well-being is to be supported. One second-level student found 'the\ncomputer room often too noisy to concentrate', whilst one of her peers noted that 'I\ndisliked the environment for accessing the tutorial, i.e. a busy computer room'. This is\nparticularly relevant because, for a majority of the students who were interviewed across\nthe consortium, time-management was very important. Two full-time level one students\nwere not attracted to using the materials in college, where they found the machines\nsubstantially slower than their own computers.\nAt every site some students had difficulties in gaining access to the computer resources or\nin satisfying their own learning pathways. Those living off-campus or learning at a\ndistance, and those who did not work well in the context of a computer room, needed\naccess from home or from machines in open-plan rooms, with space to begin to construct\ntheir own perceptions of a historical period or argument. Clearly, there is a need to balance\nthe ICT and resource priorities of departments and institutions, bearing in mind that\ntechnical difficulties are the quickest way to disaffect both students and staff.\nOf equal importance for students was tutor support in mastering the technologies that\nwould be used to achieve the course objectives. Basic IT courses, either run by the history\ndepartment concerned or by institutional IT support or education units, were available for\nall students involved in the project. However, purely voluntary sessions without formal\nrequirements were not taken up by many, and this has important ramifications for first-\nyear and mature students. These learners needed enough technological guidance from the\ntutor who was leading the course, in supervised, timetabled sessions, to remove any barriers\nto learning that the computer interface may have presented. Having the historical and\ntechnological skills was crucial. It was only where the technology became sufficiently\ntransparent that positive learning outcomes, in terms of attitudinal changes and deep-level\nthinking, were perceived by students and staff. If departments are successfully to promote\nlearner-autonomy, they need to understand and act on these issues.\nStaff perceptions\nThe themes generated by the student findings demand adequate context-based, holistic\neducational development for staff, in order to give them technical and pedagogical support\n23\nRichard Hall and Derek Harding Driving departmental change through evaluation: some outcomes and problems\n(Biggs, 1999). How far this can be achieved without reorganizing the teaching programme\nis unclear, and in any case this may not affect the negative perceptions which are held by\nmany staff about the role of ICT. These negative reactions are broad-based and\ninterconnected, having personal, academic and technological focuses.\nPersonally, skills are a problem for some staff who felt that they were not as competent as\ntheir students. Support for academic staff is crucial but institutions must overcome\nproblems concerning the time to invest in training and teaching reorganization. One tutor\nnoted that 'if training was an add-on it would be seen as an unnecessary extra burden'.\nHowever, addressing the basic need for staff to understand how computer-based resources\ncan add depth to student learning requires that they see their courses in terms of their\nstudent's needs. Approaching course development in this way is essential in order to\novercome student reluctance.\nAcademically, staff fears tended to focus on: plagiarism; the undermining of a reading\nculture; the lack of a relevant critical approach; the pre-digested, inflexible or formulaic\napproach of the courseware; and student concerns about the loss of tutor and peer-group\nsupport and guidance. These issues highlight the need for integrated technical and\npedagogical staff support which will allow ICTs to be integrated more fully into teaching\nand learning, and make staff aware of the possibilities for creating differentiated yet\nrelevant materials within a supportive learning context. One academic believed that online\nmaterials could alter student's learning patterns depending upon their enthusiasm, adding\nthat 'attractively packaged materials undoubtedly sparks\/develops interest and hence\nstimulates learning'.\nTechnical factors were major causes of staff reticence, even amongst the IT-literate. Whilst\none member of staff at a pre-1992 university stated that the tutorials were 'a good process\nof integrated learning', he added that he would not push such learning 'until I know that\nthe machines are there and that the students have access'. The six staff who taught at\nsatellite sites or who worked off-campus also pointed to infrastructural difficulties, such as\nnetworks crashing, which made effective learning, teaching and research difficult. When\ncoupled to the limited hours available to students in some computer labs, the lack of a\nrobust system is a major problem. The concomitant pressure from students both for\ngreater availability of materials and better facilities creates a demand for departmental\naction.\nThese factors have important ramifications for those staff who are reticent or opposed to\nthe use of ICT in their teaching. Such staff need support because departments cannot\nmake training voluntary while expecting the successful integration of ICT-based materials.\nThis is particularly pertinent as several students warned that they 'would not have chosen\nthe course if it revolved solely around it [the materials]'. However, for some staff the nature\nof the language of educational development is beyond their discipline-situated compass\nand at times anathema, creating a barrier to involvement. This tends to add to a sense that\nmany staff are not being touched by institutional learning and teaching development units.\nOf importance here is finding methods by which departments can invest in in-house\ndevelopments, and make the link between evaluation and pedagogy explicit.\n24\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nDepartmental change mechanisms\nDriving departmental change\nThese student and staff evaluations illuminate disciplinary preconceptions with respect to\npedagogical innovation and underpin the mechanics of departmental change. There is a\nneed to match the staff's personal, academic and technical concerns to the integration,\ncustomization, access and training issues raised by the students. Across the consortium,\nthere is a wide range of staff involvement, both in terms of teaching, training and full\nawareness-raising, and several strategies have been employed to promote departmental\ninnovation in the use of ICT. There has been no one way of achieving this, but a mix of\nmethods has been utilized.\nBoth management and staff noted how 'the power of role models' is fundamental in\nforging an awareness of good practice, and in allowing departments to overcome the\ntensions created by attempting the integration and customization of materials. Each of\nthese sites had IT-literate academics as their sub-project co-ordinator. Such staff are\ncrucial in overcoming the fears of those who felt that they were not as IT-competent as\ntheir students. Utilizing both individual and group demonstrations these academics have,\naccording to one dean, made 'colleagues . . . much more aware of [the] potential\nrepresented by ICT for effective teaching in history'. At one site it was vital that the co-\nordinator found time to work in one-to-one situations with those who were nervous about\ntheir skills levels or ambivalent about the worth of computer-based resources. .\nAt two other sites, dedicated ICT away days have been used to share the findings of the\nconsortium's evaluations. For one dean circulating such responses was crucial as 'positive\nstudent responses have confirmed the merits' of ICT-integrated initiatives. Two heads of\ndepartment at different sites concurred. The first noted that such initiatives could raise\ndepartmental awareness, whilst the other added that 'it has helped show doubting\nThomases that this . . . is feasible and within the potential of both staff and students'.\nThese approaches work to strengthen or even alter a department's approach.\nTwo consortium history departments already had well-developed and embedded ICT\nstrategies. One of these, along with a third, also had dedicated ICT support staff attached\nto their faculty. These staff had time to forge a positive link between the technical and\npedagogical needs of the academics, who had some of the pressures on them removed, by:\nfinding time to deal with ICT services to get work undertaken; creating effective and\nrelevant individual pathways for staff re-skilling; and, understanding how ICTs can be\nsuccessfully integrated within the fabric of a course. The construction and negotiation of\nan active and empowering dialogue between ICT staff with a pedagogical understanding\nand academic staff with a range of technological expertise allowed these departments, and\nparticular staff within them, to consider thoughtful curriculum change and adaptation\nwith confidence (also exemplified by Stephens and Dalgleish, 1999).\nThe process of wider staff involvement and the sharing of research data has directly\ninformed the planning of four consortium departments. Using a mixture of group and\nindividual demonstrations, general awareness-raising and dialogue about learning and\nteaching, these departments have been developing implementation plans for next semester,\nin history modules, joint history-English modules and in a cognate discipline - art and\ndesign. This is a very positive outcome and underlines the importance of supportive\n25\nRichard Hall and Derek Harding Driving departmental change through evaluation: some outcomes and problems\nenvironments in effecting change. These implementation plans have become levers to\ngenerate wider interest within and across departments.\nFor instance, six of the staff at one site will be using materials with between 25 and 100\nstudents at levels one, two and three. Not only will the training sessions be compulsory, but\nthere has also been some sense of rethinking the curriculum and course design. Source\nanalysis, workshops and commentaries will form significant parts of the module\nassessments. It is important to note the statement made in this department's implementa-\ntion plan that 'with a radical review of the history curriculum forthcoming, made\nnecessary by impending retirements, the possibility of explicitly designing course(s) around\nTLTP courseware was discussed. It was agreed to return to this matter once further\nevaluation had been carried out.' The methods that succeeded in driving departmental\nchange this far will be utilized to maintain the momentum for improving the processes and\ncontexts of their students'learning.\nIn a separate department an on-going focus group held at regular intervals with first-year\nstudents empowered both students and staff to work together in a manner akin to a\nlearning development unit. The students made suggestions about course and Web-site\ndesign, and courseware customization, as well as advising on training and evaluation\nstrategies. A module Web site was evaluated by them and the involvement of the Arts\nFaculty ICT Officer was vital in giving the students the confidence to express their own\ntechnical needs. This sense of collaboration meant that their suggestions, mediated through\nacademic and technical staff, were taken very seriously in designing teaching strategies for\nthe 1999-2000 academic year.\nA process of redesigning teaching strategies is being undertaken at four sites, and is being\nfocused upon module Web sites linked to both the courseware and discussion lists, along\nwith further customization of materials. Two of these departments are also purchasing\ntheir own servers for in-house materials in an attempt to improve access for students.\nIntegrating resources was important for the deans of faculty at these sites who saw benefits\naccruing from having materials and handbooks on an intranet, with open access for all\nstudents. One dean noted: \"The matching of the electronic materials to delivery systems on\nsite here has not been trouble-free. However, development of [the] intranet will alleviate\nthis problem'. Such outcomes indicate a clear sense of pedagogic drive fostered by\nmeaningful evaluation, which is fundamental to the process of change (Draper, 1997;\nMcllvea, Greenan and Humphreys, 1997).\nThere were also strategic drivers for change. One dean felt confident that such\ndevelopments 'will be regarded favourably in future QAAHE reviews'. Two senior\nmanagers stated that quality assurance is clearly an important factor, as it recognizes the\nneed for wider use of ICT in higher education, although one added that in the\nimplementation of computer-based learning there is a need to recognise the academic\nculture of departments and the autonomy of staff. These perceptions were matched by\nthose of four heads of department or course leaders, who felt that the use of ICT would\nhelp to attract students as well as contributing to favourable subject review. One noted: 'We\nwant to be seen as a cutting-edge department in all aspects of teaching quality and\ninnovation. ICT helps.' Another was more tentative, and stated that while skills and\nemployability were parts of their recruitment strategy, their possible effect on numbers was\n'more a hope than anything else'.\n26\nALT-] Volume 8 Number I\nInhibiting departmental change\nDespite the fact that the Chic project has found an almost overwhelming student\nacceptance of the principle that teaching materials should be available online, there are\nbroader institutional issues that affect departmental change, and these mirror those\nhighlighted by the Atkins report (HEFCE, 1998). The stresses on an individual's time-\nmanagement and the ability to find money to devote to infrastructure are crucial. One\nhead of department was worried that 'extra work for some in the developmental stage was\nnot easy to manage'. A separate department was having to contend with a business ethic\nwhich ran through its institution's ICT support services. This confronted the department's\nwishes to develop its ICT provision within a small budgetary constraint, with a need to\npurchase support that was calculated by individual network connections. For large\ndepartments with low ICT budgets such policies could prove crippling.\nClearly, the provision of adequate time and infrastructure is vital in creating a proactive\nculture of change. As important is the-understanding of managers and their ability to act\nto make staff aware of the potential of online materials. This demands that the whole issue\nof ICT needs to be placed firmly within the compass of institutional learning and teaching\npolicy (Carrotte, 1994; Foley, 1994). In proactive departments the lack of an institutional\nlead can be overcome. However, where there is no strong top-down pull towards\npedagogical innovation, in essentially reactive environments, with technophobic or hostile\nsenior and middle managers, ICT-based projects are likely to fail. Overcoming a lack of\novert support, which is often based on a lack of awareness about what is required beyond\nthe short-term, requires communication and dialogue within faculties and departments\nabout ICT in the context of learning and teaching, illuminated by evaluation data.\nConclusion\nFrom the perceptions of the students and staff involved in its first year, the Chic project\nhas shown that the use of integrated computer-based materials can encourage the\ndevelopment of critical and independent thought. A major issue for the second year of the\nproject is to address the extent to which students want to be empowered to follow their own\nlearning techniques rather than being directed too closely, and this impacts on issues of\nservice-provision (Hill, 1995; Rowley, 1997). It is vital that differentiated learning is\nsupported and in this way the development of departmental implementation plans, with\nthe support of middle and senior managers is fundamental.\nSuch change has been driven by a series of factors which in some combination have\nsupported innovation. These factors were:\n\u2022 role models at each site who could work on a one-to-one, and one-to-many basis;\n\u2022 holistic, context-specific staff training and dedicated staff away days;\n\u2022 illustrating and supporting innovation with student evaluation data;\n\u2022 matching evaluation data to broader pedagogic perceptions;\n\u2022 forging departmental implementation plans that support curriculum change and\nsuccessful QAA review;\n\u2022 effecting positive links between technical and teaching staff.\n27\nRichard Hall and Derek Harding Driving departmental change through evaluation: some outcomes and problems\nThe success of these factors in supporting innovation is affected by resource implications\nand management priorities. However, departmental change requires a holistic approach\nfrom the change-agent and this is why the Chic project is attempting to address the needs of\nall stakeholders. Without support from students,, staff and managers change will be\nillusory.\nThe finance and support that the consortium sites enjoy has made these developments\npossible. Beyond the life cycle of the project, the developments are likely to continue\nbecause their worth to the departments and faculties involved is explicitly acknowledged.\nHow this is then transmitted to the history teaching fraternity may depend upon the role of\nthe subject centre, the practice of collaborative networks of academics, and institutional\npolicy. However, the Chic project has shown how the creation of a supportive structure\nwhich highlights good practice is fundamental in gaining the uptake of materials and in\nchanging perceptions. Such an approach can provide a suitable environment for the\nsymbiosis between learning and teaching to develop.\nReferences\nBiggs, J.
