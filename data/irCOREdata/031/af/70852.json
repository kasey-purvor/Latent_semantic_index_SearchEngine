INTRODUCTION\nIt has long been recognized that, even for healthy subjects in repose, the human heart does not beat at a constant\nrate. Rather, its frequency varies in time.1\u20133 This heart rate variability influences blood flow, blood pressure,\nand other parameters of cardiovascular regulation, which also vary in time. Moreover, the influence is mutual,\nbecause of the feedback mechanisms in the system. As a result, the blood that circulates through the vessels\nand its pressure are regulated in a highly complex, dynamical way.\nA number of noninvasive measurements (e.g. ECG, blood pressure, cutaneous blood flow, respiration) can in\nprinciple be used to characterize the state of the human cardiovascular system. However, the extreme complexity\nof the system, combined with strong intrinsic noise, make it a challenging problem to find a parametric model\ncapable of describing the numerous possible states of the system. The motivation in this search for a model is\nto gain further insight into the complex control mechanisms responsible for the function of the cardiovascular\nsystem and to improve the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, especially in their early stages.\nA particular effort has been made to understand the role and origin of the oscillations observed in the\ncardiovascular signals (see reviews1,4). It is well recognized that there are three distinct oscillatory modes\n(around 1, 0.3, and 0.1 Hz for human) and it was recently suggested that two additional noisy oscillatory\nmodes contribute to the dynamics of blood distribution3,5 (around 0.04 and 0.01 Hz). With different degrees\nof confidence, each of the oscillations can be related to a particular physiological mechanism and the hope has\narisen that they can provide useful measures of the control mechanisms involved in the system.6\nThere are different, sometimes conflicting, ideas of how to explain and model cardiovascular oscillations. An\nimportant class of models is based on differential-delay equations which aim to describe feedback control loops\npresent in the system. It was suggested that the baroreflex control loop can be responsible for oscillations around\n0.1 Hz in the arterial blood pressure and the heart rate variability.4,7, 8 Also e.g. respiratory feedback control\nmechanism can result in so-called periodic or Cheyne-Stokes breathing.9,10\nCorrespondence to: A.

An example of a set of noninvasively measured cardiovascular signals\nAnother approach is based on the hypothesis that the cardiovascular system can be modelled as a system\nof coupled oscillators,3,5, 11 which is consistent with the idea that rhythmical dynamics and oscillators are ubiq-\nuitous in nature.12,13 However the choice of the model\u2019s parameters, e.g. the type of oscillators and the form\nand strength of the couplings, and the physiological significance to be attributed to them, still remain open\nproblems. Nonetheless, there is a general agreement that the underlying models of the cardiovascular oscillations\nare necessarily stochastic and nonlinear.6 Conventional linear analysis of the oscillations, e.g. wavelet or Fourier\ntransforms, which provide amplitude and frequency information, have been widely used to determine the physi-\nological origin of some of the oscillations, and the changes attributable to cardiovascular diseases. However, for\nthe description of the system\u2019s dynamics the essentially nonlinear nature of oscillations, the time-variability of\nthe characteristic frequencies of the oscillations, and the strong intrinsic noise, should also be taken into account.\nA different approach is required.\nIn this paper we suggest that fast Bayesian inference of stochastic nonlinear systems14 can be applied to\nthe cardiovascular data to infer parameters of the existing models. We present preliminary results, inferring\nthe parameters of a coupled oscillator model from measured cardiovascular data. In particular, we address the\nwell-known cardiorespiratory interaction.15 We propose that the inference technique can be further developed\nto provide a quantitative measure of the success of different models and to illuminate the critical and intricate\nproblem of model choice. We argue that this new approach can be applied to the long standing problem of\nparameterizing the state of the cardiovascular system, and that it can help to provide deeper insight into the\nphysiological and clinical significance of the model parameters.\nIn section 2 we describe briefly some cardiovascular signals that can be measured noninvasively. In section 3\nwe outline the fast Bayesian inference algorithm and show an example of inference for a model system. In section\n4 we infer parameters for coupled noise-driven oscillators. In section 5 we show an example of inference applied\nto the respiratory oscillator using measured data. In section 6 we discuss the possibility of applying the technique\nto estimate the parameters of cardiorespiratory interaction from the blood flow and respiration signals. Finally,\nin the conclusion, we list remaining problems and open questions and suggest directions for further research.\n2. NONINVASIVE MEASUREMENTS\nThere are well established techniques3 for the simultaneous measurement and recording of several kinds of\ncardiovascular signal from different sites of a body. Noninvasive measurements of ECG, respiration, blood\npressure in a finger, cutaneous blood flow and temperature signals were performed. An example of a set of\nmeasured cardiovascular signals is shown in Fig. 1. The so-called heart rate variability signal, giving a measure\nof the instantaneous heart rate, can readily be constructed from ECG signal. A big advantage of simultaneous\nmeasurements is that very diverse information about the cardiovascular system is being acquired. There is no\ndoubt that the interplay between the different cardiovascular mechanism must be manifested in the cardiovascular\nsignals, and the challenge is to extract this information.\n3. INFERENCE ALGORITHM\nMuch nonlinear time series analysis is in practice concerned with the inference of unmeasured or unmeasurable\nquantities, such as system parameters, from noisy measured time series. The most widely used approach to the\nproblem involves Bayesian inference. However, no general methods are currently available to infer the parameters\nof a nonlinear model with internal stochastic dynamics. Existing applications of the Bayesian approach rely\non heavy numerical methods (like Markov chain Monte Carlo technique) to generate the Bayesian conditional\nprobabilities.16 It was recently suggested by Vadim Smelyanskiy that the conditional probability can be obtained\nby expressing it in terms of a white noise path integral.14 Taking advantage of this idea, a concise and fast iterative\nBayesian inference scheme can be derived. This technique can be successfully used to infer the parameters of\nstochastic nonlinear models subject to additive white Gaussian noise.\nConsider for the sake of simplicity a one-dimensional dynamical system subject to additive noise of the form\nx\u02d9 = K(x|c) + \u03be(t), (1)\n\u3008\u03be(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(0)\u3009 = D\u03b4(t),\nwhere K(x|c) is the deterministic drift force, \u03be(t) is white zero-mean Gaussian noise and D is the noise intensity.\nWe assume that the unknown deterministic force can be represented in the form\nK(x|c) =\nL\u2211\nl=1\nclfl(x), (2)\nwhere fl(x) are known base functions, and c = {cl} is a set of unknown coefficients that have to be inferred from\nthe experimental data.\nWe assume that measurement error is negligible compared to the intrinsic dynamical noise \u03be(t), and we\ntreat the state variable x as directly observable. Then, using results of,17\u201319 the conditional probability density\nfunction (PDF) L(x|c) of an observation x(t) for a given choice of the model parameters c can be written as\nL(x|c) = Pst(x(t0)|c)Fc [x(t)] . (3)\nHere Pst(x|c) is a stationary PDF of the system (1) and Fc[x(t)] is a probability density functional of x(t). It\ncan be expressed through the white noise path integral using the direct interrelation between the noise variable\n\u03be(t) and x(t) given by (1). Then for the probability density functional defined on a time lattice ti = tin + i h\n(i = 0, 1, . . . , N) with the step h = (tfn \u2212 tin)\/N\nFc[x(t)] = (2piDh)\u2212N\/2 exp\n(\n\u2212h\n2\nN\u2211\ni=1\n\u2202K(xi|c)\n\u2202x\n)\nexp\n(\n\u2212 1\n2Dh\nN\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n[xi+1 \u2212 xi \u2212 hK(xi|c)]2\n)\n. (4)\nIn this derivation we assume that the time step h is sufficiently small (h\u00bf |Kx(x|c)|\u22121).\nPrior information about the model parameters is contained in a prior PDF p(c). Given a set of observations\none can improve the estimate of the model parameters by computing a posterior PDF p(c|x) taking advantage\nof Bayes\u2019 theorem\np(c|x) = L(x|c)p(c)\u222b\nL(x|c)p(c)dc . (5)\nThe integral in the denominator in (5) ensures that the posterior PDF is normalized. Clearly, equation (5) can\nbe applied iteratively each time a new record of measurements is used: the prior distribution in the next iteration\nis just the posterior distribution from the previous iteration. For a sufficiently large number N of observations\nin x the posterior distribution p(c|x) becomes sharply peaked about certain parameter values c corresponding to\nthe most probable model of the system for a given measurement set.\nWe choose the first prior PDF p(c) as a Gaussian form with respect to the unknown parameters c\np(c) =\n\u221a\ndetA0\n(2pi)L\nexp\n[\n\u22121\n2\n(c\u2212 c0)TA0(c\u2212 c0)\n]\n, (6)\nwhere c0 is a vector with arbitrary initial parameter values and A0 is a diagonal matrix with arbitrarily small\nvalues of diagonal elements reflecting, the fact that the initial values of the model parameters are not known.\nPst(x(t0)|c) in (3) can be neglected if N is large. Then the likelihood is in the form\nL(x|c) = (2piDh)\u2212N\/2 exp\n[\n\u2212R\nD\n\u2212\n(\n\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1\nD\n)T\nc\u2212 cT B\n2D\nc\n]\n, (7)\nwhere\n\u03b1k =\n\u2211\ni\n(xi+1 \u2212 xi) fk(xi), xi = x(ti),\nBk k\u2032 = h\n\u2211\ni\nfk(xi) fk\u2032(xi),\n\u03b3k =\nh\n2\n\u2211\ni\n\u2202fk(xi)\n\u2202x\n, R =\n1\n2h\n\u2211\ni\n(xi+1 \u2212 xi)2 .\nRepresenting the exponent in the posterior PDF p(c|x) as a quadratic form with respect to the vector c, and\nminimizing it, one obtains an estimate of the parameters c. The width of the distribution p(c|x) is the precision\nof this estimate. The noise intensity can be obtained by minimizing the likelihood (7) with respect to D. The\nalgorithm can be applied iteratively: the inferred value of noise intensity D, parameters c and the width of their\ndistribution are updated with each new block of data.\nThe formulation of the algorithm can easily be extended to the M -dimensional case with a general noise\nmixing matrix.\n4. INFERENCE OF PARAMETERS OF COUPLED NOISE DRIVEN OSCILLATORS\n4.1 Inference in normal coordinates\nThe system of M noise driven coupled two-dimensional oscillators can be written in an almost general form as\nx\u02d9m = F xm(xm, ym) +G\nx\nm(xm, ym, xk, yk) + \u03be\nx\nm(t), (8)\ny\u02d9m = F ym(xm, ym) +G\ny\nm(xm, ym, xk, yk) + \u03be\ny\nm(t), (9)\nwhere m, k = 1,M , k 6= m. Functions F xm, F ym define the intrinsic properties of each oscillator and Gxm, Gym\nrepresent couplings between them. \u03bexm(t), \u03beym(t) are sources of white Gaussian noise. If the base functions of\nF xm, F ym, Gxm, Gym are known, and if all the dynamical variables xm, ym are measured, one can infer all of the\nunknown parameters of the system (including noise intensities).\nTo illustrate the technique we show the result of inference of a model of two coupled noise driven Van der\nPol oscillators\nx\u02d9m = ym, (10)\ny\u02d9m = \u2212\u03c92mxm + \u03b7m(1\u2212 x2m)ym + gmxk + \u03bem(t), (11)\nwhere m, k = 1, 2, m 6= k . In this case the general inference algorithm can effectively be reduced to one\ndimensional form. The model for inference can be defined separately for each oscillator\nKm(xm, ym, xk) =\n3\u2211\nl=1\nclfl(xm, ym, xk),\nwhere f = {xm, (1\u2212x2m)ym, xk}. We infer parameters cl and noise intensityD from numerically generated time\nseries of the model (10)-(11). Phase portraits of the two oscillators and the result of inference of the parameters\nof one of them (m = 1) are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. One can see that all the parameters (including coupling\ncoefficient and noise intensity) converge to their correct values.\n\u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1 2 3\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\nx\ny\n\u22125 0 5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nx\ny\nFigure 2.

Then the couplings and\nnoise are additive terms in the equations for amplitude and phase.\nThe transformation from (x, y) to (A,\u03c6) variables is defined as\nAm =\n\u221a\nx2m + y2m, \u03c6m = arctan(\u2212ym\/xm).\nAs an example we show inference results for a pair of coupled Poincare\u00b4 oscillators\n\u03c6\u02d9m = \u03c9m + am sin\u03c6k + \u03be\u03c6m(t), (12)\nA\u02d9m = \u03b7m(Am \u2212A3m) + bm sin\u03c6k + \u03beAm(t), (13)\nwhere m, k = 1, 2, m 6= k.

INFERENCE OF THE RESPIRATORY OSCILLATOR\nTo test the ability of the inference technique to deal with real cardiovascular data we apply it to what is apparently\nthe simplest oscillator of the cardiovascular system \u2013 the respiratory oscillator.\nThe most interesting physiological information is hidden in the variations of the amplitude and phase. So it\nseems natural to consider a Poincare\u00b4-like oscillator, where the equations for amplitude and phase are uncoupled\n\u03c6\u02d9 = w, A\u02d9 = \u03b7(A\u2212A3).\nThe normal state variables are given by\nx = A cos\u03c6, y = \u2212A sin\u03c6.\nFrom the normalized measured respiration signal x shown in Fig. 8 (top, left) we need to construct both\namplitude and phase signals. This can be done approximately\u2217 with help of the Hilbert transformation.

Amplitude and phase of the respiration signal\nApart from the \u201cPoincare\u00b4-like\u201d behavior, the fluctuations of A and \u03c6 both have obvious additional periodic\ncomponents. They result from the non-sinusoidal shape of the respiratory oscillation, which we try to model as\nbeing caused by the phase of the oscillator. Then the model for inference is as follows:\n\u03c6\u02d9 = c\u03c61 + c\n\u03c6\n2 cos(2\u03c6) + c\n\u03c6\n3 sin(2\u03c6) + \u03be\n\u03c6(t), (14)\nA\u02d9 = cA1 A+ c\nA\n2 A\n3 + cA3 cos(2\u03c6) + c\nA\n4 sin(2\u03c6) + \u03be\nA(t), (15)\nwhere \u03be\u03c6(t) and \u03beA(t) are two independent sources of white Gaussian noise of intensities D\u03c6 and DA.\nThe results of inference for all of the parameters are shown in Fig. 7.\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n2.3\n2.35\n2.4\nc\u03c6 1\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\u22120.7\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.5\nc\u03c6 2\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\nc\u03c6 3\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\ntime, s\nD\n\u03c6\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n0\n0.5\n1\ncA 1\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\ncA 2\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.3\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.1\ncA 3\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n0.5\n0.6\ncA 4\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\ntime, s\nD\nA\nFigure 7.

INFERENCE OF THE CARDIORESPIRATORY INTERACTION\nIn this section we explore the possibility of inferring parameters of the cardiorespiratory interaction from the\nmeasured cardiovascular data.\nThe existence of the cardiorespiratory interaction, i.e. the interaction between the lungs and the heart, has\nbeen well known for many years (see review15). Two important results of this interaction are respiratory-sinus\narrhythmia, which means modulation of the heart rate by the respiration; and cardiorespiratory synchronization,\nmeaning that the heart and respiration can synchronize for brief episodes of time. Understanding this interaction\nis very important in understanding the basic mechanisms of the cardiovascular system. A method for estimation\nof the strength of the coupling between heart and lungs from measured time series was was recently introduced.20\nTo infer the parameters of the cardiorespiratory interaction we need to have two signals, each corresponding\nto one of the oscillators (the cardiac and the respiratory oscillators). We construct time series of the (faster)\ncardiac oscillator from the cutaneous blood flow signal, filtering out all the low frequency content below 0.5 Hz.\nIt is important that FIR filter with linear phase response is used so that the phase information is not distorted.\nWe construct time series of the respiratory oscillator in two different ways: first we take a directly measured\nrespiration signal; and, secondly, we construct the time series by extracting the respiratory related component\nfrom the blood flow signal with aid of the of filter.\nThe choice of a mathematical model for inference is an intricate task. Linear coupling terms were proposed\nto include the interactions between the cardiac and respiratory oscillatory components at the level of peripheral\nblood flow.11 Here we formulate the model for the cardiac oscillator in the blood flow signal as a Poincare\u00b4\noscillator driven by the phase of the respiratory oscillator and noise\n\u03c6\u02d9c = c\n\u03c6\n1 + c\n\u03c6\n2 sin(\u03c6r) + c\n\u03c6\n3 cos(\u03c6r) + \u03be\n\u03c6(t), (16)\nA\u02d9 = cA1 A+ c\nA\n2 A\n3 + cA2 sin(\u03c6r) + c\nA\n3 cos(\u03c6r) + \u03be\nA(t). (17)\nThis model cannot describe the whole cardiorespiratory dynamics. We use it as a pilot, trying to describe\nmodulation of the cardiac oscillator by the slow respiratory influence, and trying to infer parameters of this\nmodulation.\n\u22121.5 \u22121 \u22120.5 0 0.5 1 1.5\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nx\ny\n\u22121 \u22120.5 0 0.5 1\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\nx\ny\n\u22121.5 \u22121 \u22120.5 0 0.5 1 1.5\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nx\ny\nFigure 9.

Inference of the cardio oscillator and parameters of the cardiorespiratory modulation due to model (16)-(17)\nusing both cardiac and respiratory oscillations extracted from blood flow signal\nThe phase portraits of the cardio and the respiratory (constructed in the two different ways) oscillators are\nshown in Fig. 9. The result of inference is shown in Fig. 10 for the original respiration signal used, and in Fig. 11\nfor the extracted from blood flow respiration signal. In spite of visual differences in two respiration time series\nused (compare (middle) and (right) in Fig. 9), the results of inference (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11) are consistent. They\nsuggests that, for the signal used, there is significant modulation of amplitude of the cardiac oscillator and there\nis no noticeable modulation of phase due to respiratory influence.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have taken advantage of the new Bayesian inference technique, able to deal with stochastic\nnonlinear systems. We have used it to estimate the parameters of models of the cardiovascular signals directly\nfrom the measured time series, as well as demonstrating inference in some model system. There are still many\nopen questions to address. The main and the most difficult problem, which has so far prevented a simple\napplication of the inference scheme to cardiovascular signals, is the absence of any clear understanding of how\nthe cardiovascular signals are generated and how the different physiological mechanisms interact with each other.\nThis means that one of the two necessary parts of the inference technique \u2013 the model \u2013 is not confidently defined.\nThe choice of model is crucial, and the optimal model means that it should be good enough to capture the basic\nphysiological mechanisms, and that it should be simple enough to have a limited number of unknown parameters,\nso that they can be reliably inferred.\nMuch remains to be done in further developing and improving the inference technique. The next important\nstep will be the extension of the inference scheme for systems with non-white noise. There is no reason to suggest\nthat the intrinsic noise in the cardiovascular signals is white, and that is why general properties of noise (not\nonly the noise intensity) have to be inferred from the measured time series. Another important step to be taken\nwill be the introduction of a quantitative measure of success for different models describing the same data set.\nHowever, even at this early stage of the research, it is clear that there is a real possibility of inferring\nphysiologically relevant parameters from the cardiovascular data. Inference offers a very promising tool for the\nmodelling which is likely to contribute significantly to the development of a new diagnostic technique based on\nnoninvasive measurements.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was supported by EPSRC, INTAS, NASA Intelligent Systems\/Intelligent Data Understanding program,\nRFFI, Joy Welch Trust, British Council and the Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sport.\nREFERENCES\n1.
