J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s inequality gives a necessary condition for a non-elementary group\nof Mo\u00a8bius transformations to be discrete. In this paper we generalise this to the case of\ngroups of Mo\u00a8bius transformations of a non-Archimedean metric space. As an application,\nwe give a version of J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s inequality for SL(2,Qp).\nDedicated to the memory of Alexander Reznikov\n1. Introduction\nIn [6] J\u00f8rgensen proved a famous inequality giving a necessary condition for a non-elementary\nsubgroup of SL(2,C) to be discrete. Intuitively, this inequality says that if two elements of\nSL(2,C) generate a non-elementary discrete group then they cannot both be very close to the\nidentity. J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s theorem both makes this statement precise and gives explicit uniform\nbounds.\nThe methods used to prove this inequality have been generalised to a wide variety of\ndifferent contexts but, generally, the statements look rather different from that given by\nJ\u00f8rgensen. For example, a geometrical interpretation says there is always an embedded\ntubular neighbourhood of a very short geodesic in a hyperbolic manifold and that this\nneighbourhood, or \u201ccollar\u201d, has volume uniformly bounded away from zero. Hence handles\nin hyperbolic manifolds cannot be both short and thin.\nIn [7] Markham and Parker gave a general formulation of J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s inequality for Mo\u00a8bius\ntransformations on a metric space which recovers many known versions as special cases.\nIn these examples the one-point compactification of the metric space in question is the\nboundary of a rank one symmetric space of non-compact type, that is one of real, complex\nor quaternionic hyperbolic spaces or the octonionic hyperbolic plane. Additionally, this result\napplies when the metric space is a field, for example the p-adic numbers Qp in which case\nMo\u00a8b(Qp) = PSL(2,Qp). In the main result of this paper, Theorem 3.1, we show that for\nnon-Archimedean metric spaces one obtains a better inequality than Theorem 2.4 of [7].\nIn the case of Qp this improved version of J\u00f8rgensen\u2019s inequality looks very similar to the\noriginal statement given by J\u00f8rgensen in [6]; see Theorem 4.2. We interpret this theorem\ngeometrically in terms of the action of our group on an infinite, regular p+ 1 valent tree.\nIn the final section, we consider function field spaces. There is a strong analogy between\nthese spaces and the p-adic numbers. It is possible to give a version of Theorem 4.2 in this\ncase, but we leave details to the reader.\nWe would like to thank the referee for his\/her valuable comments. Also, we would like to\nthank Guyan Robertson for his help, in particular for telling us about reference [3].\n2. Non-Archimedean Mo\u00a8bius transformations\nLet X be a non-empty set. A distance or metric on X is a function \u03c1 from pairs of elements\n(x, y) to the real numbers satisfying:\n(i) \u03c1(x, y) \u2265 0 with equality if and only if x = y;\n(ii) \u03c1(x, y) = \u03c1(y, x);\n(iii) \u03c1(x, y) \u2264 \u03c1(x, z) + \u03c1(z, y) for all z \u2208 X.\nThe inequality in (iii) is called the triangle inequality. A metric is said to be non-Archimedean\nif the triangle inequality is replaced with the following stronger inequality, called the ultra-\nmetric inequality:\n(iv) \u03c1(x, y) \u2264 max{\u03c1(x, z), \u03c1(z, y)} for all z \u2208 X.\nA simple consequence of the ultrametric inequality is the fact that every triangle in a non-\nArchimedean metric space is isosceles:\nLemma 2.1. Suppose that \u03c1 is a non-Archimedean metric on a space X. If x, y and z are\npoints of X so that \u03c1(x, y) < \u03c1(x, z) then \u03c1(x, z) = \u03c1(y, z).\nProof. We have\n\u03c1(y, z) \u2264 max\n{\n\u03c1(x, y), \u03c1(x, z)\n}\n= \u03c1(x, z)\nby hypothesis. Likewise,\n\u03c1(x, z) \u2264 max\n{\n\u03c1(x, y), \u03c1(y, z)\n}\n= \u03c1(y, z)\nsince otherwise we would have \u03c1(x, z) \u2264 \u03c1(x, y) which would be a contradiction. Therefore,\nwe have\n\u03c1(y, z) \u2264 \u03c1(x, z) \u2264 \u03c1(y, z)\nand hence these quantities are equal. \u0003\nMany metrics arise from valuations on a ring. Let R denote a non-trivial ring. An absolute\nvalue (or valuation or norm) on R is a real valued function x 7\u2212\u2192 |x| on R satisfying:\n(i) |x| \u2265 0 with equality if and only if x = 0;\n(ii) |xy| = |x| |y|;\n(iii) |x+ y| \u2264 |x|+ |y|.\nOnce again, a valuation is said to be non-Archimedean if the inequality in (iii) is replaced\nwith the stronger inequality:\n(iv) |x+ y| \u2264 max{|x|, |y|}.\nGiven a valuation | | on a ring R we may define a metric on R by:\n\u03c1(x, y) = |x\u2212 y|.\nExamples\n(i) The standard absolute value on R or C, which gives rise to the Euclidean metric.\n(ii) Fix a prime number p and let r \u2208 Q be non-zero. Write r = pfu\/v where f \u2208 Z and\nu, v are coprime integers both of which are also coprime to p. Then define a valuation\n| |p on Q by:\n|r|p = p\u2212f , |0|p = 0. (1)\nOne can then show that |r + s|p \u2264 max\n{|r|p, |s|p}. This valuation is called the p-adic\nvaluation.\n2\nLet X be a complete non-Archimedean metric space with metric \u03c1. Following [7], we now\ndefine the Mo\u00a8bius transformations on X. Let Aut(X) \u2282 Isom(X) be a group of isometries of\nX. This may be either the full isometry group or a sufficiently large subgroup that preserves\nsome extra structure on X. We will suppose that Aut(X) acts transitively on X. The metric\n\u03c1 induces a topology on X and we give Aut(X) the corresponding compact-open topology.\nLet o be a distinguished point of X. (Since Aut(X) acts transitively, in fact we may take\no to be any point of X.) Suppose that the stabiliser of o in Aut(X) is compact. We make\nsome more assumptions about X that allow us to extend Aut(X) to the group of Mo\u00a8bius\ntransformations on X.\nGiven d \u2208 R+, a dilation with dilation factor d2 \u2208 R+ is a map Dd : X \u2212\u2192 X with\nDdo = o and for all z, w \u2208 X we have\n\u03c1(Ddz,Ddw) = d2\u03c1(z, w). (2)\n(It may seem more natural to have taken d rather than d2. However that would have intro-\nduced square roots into our formulae, such as (7) below.) Note that of d 6= 1 then Dd has a\nunique fixed point in X.\nLet X \u222a{\u221e} be the one point compactification of X. Suppose that there is an involution\nR interchanging o and \u221e and so that if z, w \u2208 X \u2212 {o} then\n\u03c1(Rz, o) =\n1\n\u03c1(z, o)\n, (3)\n\u03c1(Rz,Rw) =\n\u03c1(z, w)\n\u03c1(z, o)\u03c1(w, o)\n. (4)\nWe may think of R as reflection in the unit sphere of centre o \u2208 X.\nLet Mo\u00a8b(X) be the group generated by Aut(X), Dd and R for all d in some multiplicative\nsubgroup of R+. We call Mo\u00a8b(X) the group of Mo\u00a8bius transformations of X. There is a\nnatural topology on X \u222a {\u221e} induced from the metric \u03c1 (so neighbourhoods of \u221e are the\nexteriors of compact subsets of X). This enables us to define the compact-open topology for\ncontinuous functions from X \u222a {\u221e} to itself. We will be interested in discrete subgroups of\nMo\u00a8b(X) with respect to this topology.\nProposition 2.2 (Proposition 2.1 of [7]). Let X be a metric space and Mo\u00a8b(X) be the group\ngenerated by Aut(X), Dd and R satisfying (2), (3) and (4).\n(i) Let A be any element of Mo\u00a8b(X) for which A\u221e = \u221e. Then there exists a positive\nnumber dA so that for all z, w \u2208 X\n\u03c1(Az,Aw) = dA2\u03c1(z, w).\n(ii) Let B be any element of Mo\u00a8b(X) for which B\u221e 6= \u221e. Then there exists a positive\nnumber rB so that for all z, w \u2208 X \u2212 {B\u22121\u221e}\n\u03c1(Bz,Bw) =\nrB\n2\u03c1(z, w)\n\u03c1(z,B\u22121\u221e)\u03c1(w,B\u22121\u221e) ,\n\u03c1(Bz,B\u221e) = rB\n2\n\u03c1(z,B\u22121\u221e) .\nThe intuition behind Proposition 2.2(ii) is that B is like reflection in a sphere of radius\nrB followed by an isometry. Also, we see that for all B \u2208 Mo\u00a8b(X) with B\u221e 6=\u221e we have\n\u03c1(Bz, z)\n\u03c1(Bz,B\u221e) =\n\u03c1(z,B\u22121z)\n\u03c1(B\u22121z,B\u22121\u221e) . (5)\nLemma 2.3 (Lemma 2.2 of [7]). Let X be a metric space. If Aut(X) acts transitively on X\nthen Mo\u00a8b(X) acts 2-transitively on X \u222a {\u221e}. That is, given any two pairs x1, y1; x2, y2 of\npoints in X \u222a {\u221e} then there exists B \u2208 G so that B(x2) = x1 and B(y2) = y1.\n3\nLemma 2.4 (Lemma 2.3 of [7]). Let X be a metric space. Suppose that B \u2208 Mo\u00a8b(X) fixes\ndistinct points x, y \u2208 X \u222a{\u221e}. Then B is conjugate to A \u2208 Mo\u00a8b(X) with fixed points o and\n\u221e. Moreover, the dilation factor dA2 of A is independent of the conjugating map.\nDefine the cross-ratio of quadruples of points in X \u222a {\u221e} by\nX(z1, z2;w1, w2) =\n\u03c1(w1, z1)\u03c1(w2, z2)\n\u03c1(w2, z1)\u03c1(w1, z2)\n,\nX(z1,\u221e;w1, w2) = \u03c1(w1, z1)\n\u03c1(w2, z1)\n.\nUsing Proposition 2.2 it is not hard to show that the cross-ratio of four points is preserved\nby the action of Mo\u00a8b(X). Also, the cross-ratios satisfy the following property that resembles\nthe ultrametric inequality\nProposition 2.5. Let X be a non-Archimedean metric space. Let z1, z2, w1, w2 be four dis-\ntinct points in X \u222a {\u221e}. Then\nX(w2, z2;w1, z1) \u2264 max\n{\n1, X(z1, z2;w1, w2)\n}\n,\n1 \u2264 max\n{\nX(w2, z2;w1, z1), X(z1, z2;w1, w2)\n}\n.\nProof. When z2 =\u221e we have\nX(z1,\u221e;w1, w2) = \u03c1(w1, z1)\n\u03c1(w2, z1)\n, X(w2,\u221e;w1, z1) = \u03c1(w1, w2)\n\u03c1(w2, z1)\nand the result follows directly from\n\u03c1(w1, w2) \u2264 max\n{\n\u03c1(w1, z1), \u03c1(w2, z1)\n}\n, \u03c1(w2, z1) \u2264 max\n{\n\u03c1(w1, z1), \u03c1(w1, w2)\n}\n.\nNow using the invariance of the cross-ratio under Mo\u00a8b(X) we get the result for general\nquadruples of points. \u0003\nLet A be an element of Mo\u00a8b(X) fixing x, y \u2208 X \u222a {\u221e} with dilation factor dA2 which\nmay be 1 (see Lemma 2.4). Suppose that mA is a positive number so that for all points\nz \u2208 X \u222a {\u221e} \u2212 {x, y} we have\nX(x,Az; y, z) \u2264 dAmA. (6)\nThis is a conjugation invariant statement of the following inequality in the special case when\nx = o and y =\u221e:\n\u03c1(z,Az) \u2264 dAmA\u03c1(o, z). (7)\nObserve that combining (7) with Proposition 2.2 gives\n\u03c1(z,A\u22121z) \u2264 dA\u22121mA\u03c1(z, o)\nand so mA\u22121 = mA. The number mA gives a quantitative measure of how near A is to the\nidentity: if A is close to the identity then the distance from z to Az should be small and\nhence mA must be small. We remark that such an mA always exists. For example using\nAo = o and the ultrametric inequality, we obtain\n\u03c1(z,Az) \u2264 max{\u03c1(o, z), \u03c1(o,Az)} = dAmax{dA, 1\/dA}\u03c1(o, z). (8)\nThus one may always take mA = max{dA, 1\/dA} \u2265 1.\nLemma 2.6. Let X be a non-Archimedean metric space. Suppose that A \u2208 Mo\u00a8b(X) is\nconjugate to a dilation with dA 6= 1. If mA is any positive number satisfying (6) then\nmA \u2265 max{dA, 1\/dA} > 1.\n4\nProof. Assume A fixes o and \u221e and that mA is any positive number satisfying (7). Since\ndA 6= 1 then \u03c1(z, o) 6= \u03c1(o,Az). Hence, using Lemma 2.1, we have equality in (8). In other\nwords,\n\u03c1(z,Az) = dAmax\n{\ndA, 1\/dA\n}\n\u03c1(o, z)\nand so if mA satisfies (7) we have dAmA\u03c1(o, z) \u2265 \u03c1(z,Az) = dAmax\n{\ndA, 1\/dA\n}\n\u03c1(o, z) and\nmA \u2265 max{dA, 1\/dA} > 1 as claimed. \u0003\nThe intuition behind Lemma 2.6 is that, when dA 6= 1, the map A is uniformly bounded\naway from the identity. For example, when A fixes o and \u221e we have\n\u03c1(z,Az) = dAmax\n{\ndA, 1\/dA\n}\n\u03c1(z, o) \u2265 \u03c1(z, o)\nand so \u03c1(z,Az) is bounded below by a number depending on z but independent of A.\n3. The main theorem\nThe main result of this paper is:\nTheorem 3.1. Let X be a complete non-Archimedean metric space and suppose that Aut(X)\nis a group of isometries of X that acts transitively on X with compact stabilisers. Suppose\nthat Mo\u00a8b(X), the group of Mo\u00a8bius transformations on X, satisfies hypotheses (2), (3) and\n(4). Let A be an element of Mo\u00a8b(X) with exactly two fixed points, which we denote by x\nand y. Let mA be a positive number satisfying (6). If \u0393 is a discrete subgroup of Mo\u00a8b(X)\ncontaining A, then for all B \u2208 \u0393 so that {Bx, By} \u2229 {x, y} = \u2205 we have\nm2Amax\n{\n1, X(Bx, y;x,By)\n}\n\u2265 1. (9)\nUsing Lemma 2.3, since Aut(X) acts transitively on X we see that Mo\u00a8b(X) acts 2-\ntransitively on X \u222a {\u221e}. Thus, without loss of generality, in what follows we shall suppose\nthat A fixes x = o and y =\u221e. Then the cross-ratio in (9) becomes:\nX(Bo,\u221e; o,B\u221e) = \u03c1(o,Bo)\n\u03c1(B\u221e, Bo) .\nWe now begin the proof of Theorem 3.1. This will broadly follow Section 2.3 of [7].\nThe main difference will come from the fact that we are working with a non-Archimedean\nmetric. Our strategy is to assume that the hypothesis (9) fails. In particular, we must have\nmA < 1 and so dA = 1, using Lemma 2.6. (Recall, that as we saw above if dA 6= 1 then\nA is uniformly bounded away from the identity in the sense that \u03c1(z,Az) \u2265 \u03c1(z, o).) We\nconstruct a sequence Bn for n = 0, 1, . . . as follows. Let Bn be defined by B0 = B and\nBn+1 = BnAB\u22121n . Let xn = Bno and yn = Bn\u221e be the fixed points of Bn+1. Let rn denote\nrBn . We shall show that when the hypothesis (9) is not true then the Bn form a sequence of\ndistinct elements of \u0393 that tend to the identity as n tends to infinity. This contradicts our\nhypothesis that \u0393 is discrete.\nWe begin by supposing that xn, yn 6\u2208 {o,\u221e} for all n. We then show that xn tends to o\nand yn tends to \u221e as n tends to infinity, Corollary 3.8. This immediately implies that the\nBn are distinct.\nLemma 3.2. Let A be a dilation fixing o and \u221e with mA < 1. With the above notation\n\u03c1(o, xn+1) \u2264 mA\u03c1(xn+1, yn) \u03c1(o, xn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n,\n1\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn+1)\n\u2264 mA\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn)\n\u03c1(o, yn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n.\n5\nProof. This follows the proof of Lemma 2.5 of [7]. Using Lemma 2.6, since mA < 1 we have\ndA = 1. Using Proposition 2.2 and (7) we have\n\u03c1(o, xn+1) = \u03c1(o,BnABn\u22121o)\n=\nrn\n2\u03c1(Bn\u22121o,ABn\u22121o)\n\u03c1(ABn\u22121o,Bn\u22121\u221e)\u03c1(Bn\u22121o,Bn\u22121\u221e)\n\u2264 mArn\n2\u03c1(o,Bn\u22121o)\n\u03c1(ABn\u22121o,Bn\u22121\u221e)\u03c1(Bn\u22121o,Bn\u22121\u221e)\n=\nmA\u03c1(BnAB\u22121n o,Bn\u221e)\u03c1(o,Bno)\n\u03c1(Bno,Bn\u221e)\n= mA\u03c1(xn+1, yn)\n\u03c1(o, xn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n.\nWe have used (5) on the penultimate line. Similarly, we have\n1\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn+1)\n=\n1\n\u03c1(BnABn\u22121o,BnABn\u22121\u221e)\n=\n\u03c1(ABn\u22121o,Bn\u22121\u221e)\u03c1(ABn\u22121\u221e, Bn\u22121\u221e)\nrn2\u03c1(ABn\u22121o,ABn\u22121\u221e)\n\u2264 mA\u03c1(ABn\n\u22121o,Bn\u22121\u221e)\u03c1(o,Bn\u22121\u221e)\nrn2\u03c1(Bn\u22121o,Bn\u22121\u221e)\n=\nmA\u03c1(o,Bn\u221e)\n\u03c1(BnAB\u22121n o,Bn\u221e)\u03c1(Bno,Bn\u221e)\n=\nmA\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn)\n\u03c1(o, yn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n.\n\u0003\nSuppose that\nXn = X(Bno,\u221e; o,Bn\u221e) = \u03c1(o,Bno)\n\u03c1(Bno,Bn\u221e) =\n\u03c1(o, xn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n.\nWe may rewrite our hypothesis that (9) fails as\nmA < 1 and m2AX0 < 1.\nWe shall show, first, that if the hypothesis (9) fails to hold then there is an N \u2265 1 so that\nXN \u2264 1 and, secondly, that this implies that Xn tends to zero as n tends to infinity.\nLemma 3.3. Suppose that Xn > 1 then Xn+1 \u2264 m2AX2n.\nProof. Since Xn > 1 we have \u03c1(xn, yn) < \u03c1(o, xn). Therefore, using Lemma 2.1, we see that\n\u03c1(o, yn) = \u03c1(o, xn). This means that\nXn+1 =\n\u03c1(o, xn+1)\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn+1)\n\u2264 m2A\n\u03c1(o, xn)\u03c1(o, yn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)2\n= m2A\n(\n\u03c1(o, xn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n)2\n= m2AX2n.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.4. Suppose that Xn \u2264 1 then Xn+1 \u2264 m2AXn.\n6\nProof. If Xn \u2264 1 then \u03c1(o, xn) \u2264 \u03c1(xn, yn). Thus\n\u03c1(o, yn) \u2264 max\n{\n\u03c1(o, xn), \u03c1(xn, yn)\n}\n= \u03c1(xn, yn).\nThis means that\nXn+1 =\n\u03c1(o, xn+1)\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn+1)\n\u2264 m2A\n\u03c1(o, xn)\u03c1(o, yn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)2\n\u2264 m2A\n\u03c1(o, xn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n= m2AXn.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.5. Suppose that m2AX0 < 1. Then there exists N \u2265 0 so that XN \u2264 1.\nProof. If X0 \u2264 1 then we choose N = 0. Suppose that Xk > 1 for all 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u2212 1. Then,\nusing Lemma 3.3, we have\nm2AXn \u2264\n(\nm2AXn\u22121\n)2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 (m2AX0)2n .\nSincem2AX0 < 1, this sequence is eventually at mostm2A. Therefore we can only have Xn > 1\nfor finitely many values of n. Hence there exists N with XN \u2264 1. \u0003\nLemma 3.6. Suppose that XN \u2264 1 then Xn \u2264 m2n\u22122NA for all n \u2265 N . In particular, if\nmA < 1 then Xn tends to zero as n tends to infinity.\nProof. We use induction. We have XN \u2264 1 = m0A. Suppose that Xn \u2264 m2n\u22122NA for some\nn \u2265 N . Then, using Lemma 3.4, we have Xn+1 \u2264 m2AXn \u2264 m2n+2\u22122NA . The result follows.\n\u0003\nWe now use the fact that Xn tends to zero as n tends to infinity to show that \u03c1(o, xn)\ntends to zero and \u03c1(xn, yn) tends to infinity as n tends to infinity.\nLemma 3.7. Suppose that mA < 1 and XN \u2264 1. Then for all n \u2265 N we have\n\u03c1(o, xn) \u2264 mn\u2212NA \u03c1(o, xN ) and\n1\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n\u2264 m\nn\u2212N\nA\n\u03c1(xN , yN )\n.\nIn particular, \u03c1(o, xn) tends to zero and \u03c1(xn, yn) tends to infinity as n tends to infinity.\nProof. Using Lemma 3.6, we see that mAXn \u2264 m2n+1\u22122NA \u2264 mA < 1 for all n \u2265 N . Thus\n\u03c1(o, xn+1) \u2264 mAXn\u03c1(xn+1, yn) < \u03c1(xn+1, yn),\nand so, using Lemma 2.1, we see that \u03c1(o, yn) = \u03c1(xn+1, yn). As we already know that\n\u03c1(o, yn) \u2264 \u03c1(xn, yn), this means\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn) = \u03c1(o, yn) \u2264 \u03c1(xn, yn).\nUsing Lemma 3.2, we have\n\u03c1(o, xn+1) \u2264 mA\u03c1(o, xn) \u03c1(xn+1, yn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n\u2264 mA\u03c1(o, xn).\nUsing induction, we see that \u03c1(o, xn) \u2264 mn\u2212NA \u03c1(o, xN ) as claimed.\nSimilarly, from the second part of Lemma 3.2, we have\n1\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn+1)\n\u2264 mA\n\u03c1(xn+1, yn)\n\u03c1(o, yn)\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n\u2264 mA\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n.\nAgain, we use induction to get\n1\n\u03c1(xn, yn)\n\u2264 m\nn\u2212N\nA\n\u03c1(xN , yN )\n.\n\u0003\n7\nCorollary 3.8. The points xn tend to o and the points yn tend to \u221e as n tends to infinity.\nWe claim that the Bn lie in a compact subset of Mo\u00a8b(X). Hence (a subsequence of) the\nBn tend to the identity. Since the Bn are distinct, we see that \u3008A,B\u3009 is not discrete. This\nwill prove the main theorem in the case where xn, yn 6= o,\u221e.\nIn order to verify the claim, observe that we may choose Dn lying in a compact subset\nof Mo\u00a8b(X) so that DnBnDn\u22121 fixes both o and \u221e. Secondly, since Bn is conjugate to A,\nusing Lemma 2.4 we see that the dilation factor of DnBnDn\u22121 is 1. Thus for all z, w \u2208 X\nwe have\n\u03c1(DnBnDn\u22121A\u22121z,DnBnDn\u22121A\u22121w) = \u03c1(A\u22121z,A\u22121w) = \u03c1(z, w).\nHence DnBnDn\u22121A\u22121 is in Aut(X) and fixes o. By hypothesis the stabiliser of o in Aut(X)\nis compact. Hence Bn lies in a compact subset of Mo\u00a8b(X) as claimed.\nWe need to treat the case where there is an N \u2265 0 for which either xN or yN is o or \u221e,\nand so xN+1 = o or yN+1 = \u221e. Without loss of generality, suppose yN+1 = \u221e and hence\nyn =\u221e for all n \u2265 N + 1.\nSuppose xn 6= o for all n. We will not use (9) but only the fact that \u3008A,B\u3009 is discrete.\n(Note that taking N = 0 this shows that if \u3008A,B\u3009 is discrete then {Bo,B\u221e} \u2229 {o, \u221e}\ncannot be just one point.) Consider the sequence Bn as defined above. By construction, Bn\nis conjugate to A and fixes \u221e for n \u2265 N +1 and so dBn = dA = 1. In other words, Bn is an\nisometry of X for n \u2265 N + 1. Hence for n \u2265 N + 1 we have\n\u03c1(xn+1, o) = \u03c1(BnABn\u22121o, o)\n= \u03c1(ABn\u22121o,Bn\u22121o)\n\u2264 mA\u03c1(Bn\u22121o, o)\n= mA\u03c1(Bno, o)\n= mA\u03c1(xn, o)\n\u2264 mn\u2212NA \u03c1(xN+1, o).\nTherefore xn tends to o as n tends to infinity and, arguing as above, Bn is a sequence of\ndistinct elements of \u3008A,B\u3009 converging to the identity. Again, \u3008A,B\u3009 cannot be discrete.\nFinally, suppose xN+1 = o and yN+1 = \u221e for some N \u2265 0. Thus Bn+1 fixes both o and\n\u221e for all n \u2265 N + 1. Again we will not use (9), but this time we only use the fact that\n{Bo, B\u221e} \u2229 {o, \u221e} = \u2205. Since A has precisely two fixed points, if Bn+1 = BnABn\u22121 fixes\nboth o and \u221e then Bn either fixes both o and \u221e or interchanges them. Without loss of\ngenerality, suppose that N is the smallest index for which xN+1 = o and yN+1 = \u221e. Since\n{B0o, B0\u221e}\u2229{o, \u221e} = \u2205, we may assume that N \u2265 1. Then BNo =\u221e and BN\u221e = o and\nwe see that BN has an orbit of size 2. Thus B2N fixes points that BN does not. Since BN is\nconjugate to A, this is a contradiction. This proves the theorem.\n4. The p-adic numbers\nIn this section we consider the case where X = Qp, the p-adic numbers, that is, the com-\npletion of Q with respect to the p-adic valuation (1). We show that Mo\u00a8b(X) is then the\nmatrix group PSL(2,Qp) = SL(2,Qp)\/{\u00b1I} acting on Qp\u222a{\u221e} by Mo\u00a8bius transformations.\nDiscrete subgroups of SL(2,Qp) have been considered by Ihara [5] and Serre in Chapter II.1\nof [8], in particular page 84. Our main theorem gives a necessary condition for a subgroup\nof SL(2,Qp) to be discrete, Theorem 4.2. This is very similar to the standard version of\nJ\u00f8rgensen\u2019s inequality, [6]. In [4] Gromov and Schoen considered more general p-adic repre-\nsentations of lattices in non-compact, semisimple Lie groups. Our main result should apply\nin many of these cases.\n8\nThe construction of the p-adic numbers and their properties in terms of non-Archimedean\nspaces is well known; see Artin [1], Cassels [2], and Serre [8], for example. We recall that\na p-adic integer is any p-adic number \u03b1 with |\u03b1|p \u2264 1. Thus, the ring of p-adic integers,\ndenoted Zp, is the p-adic unit ball in Qp. Each p-adic integer \u03b1 has an expansion\n\u03b1 =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nanp\nn (10)\nwhere an \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , p\u2212 1} and so Zp is compact; see Lemma 2 on page 10 of Cassels [2].\nLikewise, a p-adic unit is any u \u2208 Qp so that u \u2208 Zp and u\u22121 \u2208 Zp. That is, u has the form\n(10) with a0 6= 0. Since the set of units is the intersection of two compact subsets of Qp, we\nsee that it is compact.\nWe now show how to define a tree T whose boundary is Qp \u222a {\u221e}. This idea is due to\nSerre, [8], but our treatment will follow Figa`-Talamanca [3]. The closed balls in Qp are the\nvertices of T , that is\nV =\n{\nx+ pkZp : x \u2208 Qp, k \u2208 Z\n}\n.\nTwo vertices x+pkZp and y+pjZp are joined by an edge of T if and only if either k = j+1\nand x \u2212 y \u2208 pjZp or else j = k + 1 and x \u2212 y \u2208 pkZp; see page 8 of [3]. In other words,\n|j \u2212 k| = 1 and one of the balls is contained in the other. Notice that each ball x+ pkZp of\nradius p\u2212k is contained in exactly one ball x+ pk\u22121Zp of radius p\u2212k+1 and contains exactly\np balls x+ ypk + pk+1Zp of radius p\u2212k\u22121 where y = 0, 1, . . . , p\u2212 1. Hence each vertex has\nexactly p + 1 edges emanating from it. Therefore the graph T we have just constructed is\nan infinite, regular p+ 1 tree.\nWe now find the boundary of T ; see [3]. We consider geodesic paths through T . In other\nwords, such a path is a (possibly infinite) sequence of vertices vj so that for all j the vertices\nvj , vj+1 are joined by an edge and vj\u22121 6= vj+1, that is there is no back tracking. The semi-\ninfinite geodesic path p\u2212kZp for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . identifies a point of the boundary denoted\nby \u221e. Every other semi-infinite geodesic path starting at the vertex Zp eventually consists\nof a sequence of nested, decreasing balls x + pkZp for k = K, K + 1, K + 2, . . .. The limit\nof this sequence is the point x of Qp. Choosing a starting point other than Zp makes only\nfinitely many changes to these paths. Hence the boundary of T is Qp \u222a {\u221e}.\nAny two distinct points z, w in Qp \u222a {\u221e} are the end points of a unique doubly infinite\ngeodesic path through T . We denote this path by \u03b3(z, w). The cross-ratio X(z1, z2;w1, w2)\nhas the following interpretation in terms of T .\nLemma 4.1. Suppose that z1, z2, w1, w2 are four distinct points of Qp \u222a {\u221e}. Let \u03b3(z1, w2)\nand \u03b3(z2, w1) be the geodesics joining z1, w2 and z2, w1. If X(z1, z2;w1, w2) = pd > 1. Then\nthe shortest path in T from \u03b3(z1, w2) to \u03b3(z2, w1) has d edges. If X(z1, z2;w1, w2) \u2264 1 then\n\u03b3(z1, w2) and \u03b3(z2, w1) intersect.\nProof. Without loss of generality we suppose that w1 = o and z2 = \u221e. Then we have\nX(x,\u221e; o, y) = \u03c1(o, x)\/\u03c1(x, y). The geodesic \u03b3(o,\u221e) passes through vertices pjZp for j \u2208 Z.\nSuppose first that the first few terms in the expansion of x and y are the same. In other\nwords, we have x = pj(a+ bpk) and y = pj(a+ cpk) where k > 0 and a, b, c are units with\nb 6= c. Then \u03c1(o, x) = p\u2212j and \u03c1(x, y) = p\u2212j\u2212k and thus we have X(x,\u221e; o, y) = pk > 1.\nEvery vertex on the geodesic \u03b3(x, y) has the form pj(a+ bpk + plZp) or pj(a+ cpk + plZp)\nwhere l \u2265 k > 0. The points of \u03b3(o,\u221e) and \u03b3(x, y) closest to each other are pjZp and\npj(a+ pkZp). The geodesic segment joining them has k edges and passes through the k + 1\nvertices pj(a+ plZp) for l = 0, 1, . . . , k. This proves the first part of the lemma.\nSuppose now that the first few terms of z1 and w2 are not the same. That is, we have\nz1 = apj and w2 = bpk where a and b are units and either j 6= k or, if j = k, then a \u2212 b\nis a unit. Then \u03c1(o, z1) = p\u2212j , \u03c1(w2, z1) = p\u2212min(j,k) and X(z1,\u221e; o, w2) = pmin(0,k\u2212j) \u2264 1.\n9\nThen the geodesic joining z1 and z2 passes through pjZk, which also lies on the geodesic\njoining o and \u221e. \u0003\nWe claim that Mo\u00a8b(Qp) is PSL(2,Qp) acting on Qp via Mo\u00a8bius transformations. Let\nAut(Qp) be the collection of maps Ax = (ax + b)a where a is a unit in Qp and b is any\nelement of Qp. For d = p\u2212m the dilation Dd is defined by Ddx = p2mx and satisfies (2):\n\u03c1(Ddx,Ddy) = |p2mz \u2212 p2mw|p = |p2m|p|z \u2212 w|p = d2|z \u2212 w|p = d2\u03c1(z, w).\nThe inversion R is given by Rx = \u22121\/x and clearly satisfies (3) and (4):\n\u03c1(Rx, o) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22121x\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\np\n=\n1\n|x|p =\n1\n\u03c1(x, o)\n,\n\u03c1(Rx,Ry) =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22121x \u2212 \u22121y\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\np\n=\n|x\u2212 y|p\n|x|p|y|p =\n\u03c1(x, y)\n\u03c1(x, o)\u03c1(y, o)\n.\nAs elements of SL(2,Qp) these three maps are given by\nA =\n(\na b\n0 a\u22121\n)\n, Dd =\n(\npm 0\n0 p\u2212m\n)\n, R =\n(\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n)\n.\nThe maps A, Dd and R also act on T . Consider the vertex v = pj(x + pkZp) where x is a\nunit and k \u2265 0. The action of isometries and dilations is straightforward; see pages 9 and\n10 of [3]:\nA\n(\npj(x+ pkZp)\n)\n= pj(a2x+ pkZp) + ba, Dd\n(\npj(x+ pkZp)\n)\n= pj+2m(x+ pkZp).\nThe action of R is slightly more complicated. Let y be the unit with xy = \u22121. Then\nR\n(\npj(x+ pkZp)\n)\n= p\u2212j(y + pkZp).\nif k > 0 and R(pjZp) = p\u2212jZp. One may easily check that R preserves the structure of T .\nClearly Aut(Qp) acts transitively on Qp: For any b \u2208 Qp the map A(x) = x + b sends o\nto b. Notice that the stabiliser of o in Aut(Qp) comprises those maps A(x) = a2x where a is\na unit. Since the units form a compact subset of Qp, we see that Aut(X) acts with compact\nstabilisers. This means that the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1 are satisfied in this case. In fact,\nwe can restate Theorem 3.1 in a more familiar form:\nTheorem 4.2. Let A be a an element of SL(2,Qp) conjugate to a diagonal matrix. Let B be\nany element of SL(2,Qp) so that, when acting on Qp \u222a {\u221e} via Mo\u00a8bius transformations, B\nneither fixes nor interchanges the fixed points of A. If \u0393 = \u3008A,B\u3009 is discrete then\nmax\n{\u2223\u2223\u2223tr2(A)\u2212 4\u2223\u2223\u2223\np\n,\n\u2223\u2223\u2223tr[A,B]\u2212 2\u2223\u2223\u2223\np\n}\n\u2265 1.\nProof. Suppose that\nA =\n(\n\u03bb 0\n0 \u03bb\u22121\n)\n, B =\n(\na b\nc d\n)\n,\nwhere \u03bb, a, b, c, d \u2208 Qp and ad\u2212 bc = 1. Then mA = |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb\u22121|p and Bo = b\/d, B\u221e = a\/c.\nBy hypothesis neither Bo nor B\u221e is either o or \u221e, so\nX(Bo,\u221e; o,B\u221e) = |b\/d|p|a\/c\u2212 b\/d|p =\n|b|p|c|p\n|ad\u2212 bc|p = |bc|p.\nWe can then calculate\u2223\u2223\u2223tr2(A)\u2212 4\u2223\u2223\u2223\np\n= |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb\u22121|2p = m2A,\u2223\u2223\u2223tr[A,B]\u2212 2\u2223\u2223\u2223\np\n= |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb\u22121|2p |bc|p = m2AX(Bo,\u221e; o,B\u221e).\nThe result follows directly from Theorem 3.1. \u0003\n10\nWe can interpret this result geometrically in terms of the action of \u3008A, B\u3009 on T as follows.\nLet A be as in the proof of Theorem 4.2 and write \u03bb = pja where a = a0 + a1p + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 is a\nunit. Then \u03bb\u22121 = p\u2212jb where b = b0 + b1p+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 is the unit with ab = 1.\nSuppose that mA = |\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb\u22121| < 1. Then j = 0 and p divides a\u2212 b, that is a0 = b0. Since\nab = 1 this means that a0b0 = a20 is congruent to 1 (mod p); that is \u03bb\n2 is congruent to 1\n(mod p). In this case, A(z) = \u03bb2z fixes each vertex pjZp. In other words, A fixes \u03b3(o,\u221e).\nFor such maps, Theorem 3.1 states that X(Bo,\u221e; o,B\u221e) \u2265 1\/mA > 1. Geometrically this\nmeans that \u03b3(o,\u221e) does not intersect its image under B.\nOn the other hand, if A has dA 6= 1 then A maps the geodesic \u03b3(o,\u221e) to itself shifting\neach vertex along by a fixed number of edges (see page 77 of Serre [8]). Recall that in this\ncase mA \u2265 1 and \u03c1(z,Az) \u2265 \u03c1(z, o). This corresponds to the fact that A must translate each\nvertex by a whole number of edges and so cannot have arbitrarily short translation length.\n5. Function field spaces\nWe now explain how a function field can be thought of as resembling the p-adic numbers\nQp as developed in Section 4. We consider a field k and the field k(t) of rational functions\nover k. The elements of k(t) are quotients of two elements of the polynomial ring k[t] over\nk. Then k(t) is analogous to Q and k[t] to Z. We choose an irreducible polynomial p(t) in\nk[t] which plays the role analogous to the prime p in the definition of Qp. We consider an\nelement \u03c6(t) \u2208 k(t) and we write\n\u03c6(t) = p(t)f\nu(t)\nv(t)\nwhere f \u2208 Z and u(t), v(t) are polynomials in k[t] without common factors and so that p(t)\ndoes not divide either u(t) or v(t). Following (1) above, we define\u2223\u2223\u03c6(t)\u2223\u2223\np(t)\n= c\u2212f (11)\nwhere c > 1 and we develop the theory in a manner resembling the p-adic case.\nThere is another approach, which we prefer in this section; see Artin [1] or Section II.1.6 of\nSerre [8]. If we replace the irreducible polynomial p(t) with the rational function 1\/t (which\ncorresponds to \u221e at t = 0) then the valuation corresponding to (11) is\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223u(t)v(t)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = cdeg(u)\u2212deg(v). (12)\nHere the polynomials u(t) and v(t) have no common factors and have degree deg(u) and\ndeg(v) respectively. This valuation corresponds to the standard absolute value in the case\nof Q. The valuation (12) is non-Archimedean and leads to an ultrametric space.\nIn number theoretic applications (for example to the function fields of curves defined over\nfinite fields) it is natural to define the number c in (11) to be q, where k is the field Fq of q\nelements.\nWe are led, accordingly, to consider u(t) = antn + an\u22121tn\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + a0 in k[t] with\nan, an\u22121, . . . , a0 \u2208 k and n \u2265 0. We introduce the valuation\n\u2223\u2223u(t)\u2223\u2223 = {cdeg(u) = cn if u(t) 6= 0,\n0 if u(t) = 0.\n(13)\n11\nIt follows that \u2223\u2223u(t) v(t)\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223u(t)\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223v(t)\u2223\u2223,\u2223\u2223u(t) + v(t)\u2223\u2223 \u2264 max{\u2223\u2223u(t)\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223v(t)\u2223\u2223},\u2223\u2223u(t) + v(t)\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223u(t)\u2223\u2223 if deg(v) < deg(u).\nIf we take k = Fq and c = q then\n\u2223\u2223u(t)\u2223\u2223 = qdeg(u) (for u(t) 6= 0) is the number of residue\nclasses of polynomials in Fq[t] modulo u(t), which is why c = q is the natural choice. (Each\nresidue class may be represented by a polynomial of degree less than u(t). There are q choices\nfor each of the deg(u) coefficients.)\nIf k(t) denotes the quotient field of k[t] then the the valuation defined by (13) extends in\nthe obvious way to (12). The field k{t} of formal Laurent series in 1\/t consists of the series\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(t) = antn + an\u22121tn\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ a0 + a\u22121t\u22121 + a\u22122t\u22122 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nwhich is the completion of k(t) with respect to the valuation (12) and is analogous to the\ncompletion of Q with respect to the Archimedean valuation. For such a \u03c6 we have\n|\u03c6| = \u2223\u2223\u03c6(t)\u2223\u2223 = cn. (14)\nWe may define Mo\u00a8b\n(\nk{t}) in terms of SL(2, k{t}) acting on k{t} via Mo\u00a8bius transforma-\ntions and, similarly, Aut\n(\nk{t}). The dilations Dd are given by Dd(\u03c6) = t2m\u03c6. We can prove\nthe analogue of Theorem 4.2 with the valuation (14) in place of the p-adic valuation.\nReferences\n[1] E. Artin, Algebraic Numbers and Algebraic Functions, Nelson 1968.\n[2] J.W.S.
