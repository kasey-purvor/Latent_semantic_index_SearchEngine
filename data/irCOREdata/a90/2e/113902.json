Through studies of chronic misalignment between our internal clocks \nand the environment (e.g. during shift work), it has long been postulated that \ndisruption of circadian rhythms is detrimental to human health.  Recent advances in \nunderstanding of the cellular and molecular basis of mammalian circadian timing \nmechanisms have identified many key genes involved in circadian rhythm generation \nand demonstrated the presence of clocks throughout the body.  Furthermore, clear \nlinks between sleep, circadian rhythms and metabolic function have been revealed and \nmuch current research is studying these links in more detail.  Here, we review the \ncurrent evidence linking circadian rhythms, clock genes and adipose biology.  We \nalso highlight gaps in our understanding and finally suggest avenues for future \nresearch. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nCircadian rhythms are endogenously controlled changes in physiology and behaviour \nthat enable organisms to regulate their biology in anticipation of predictable daily \nchanges in the environment.  These rhythms occur with a periodicity of approximately \n24 hours and, in order to maintain an appropriate temporal relationship with the \noutside world, the phase of endogenous clocks is synchronised (entrained) by external \ntime cues, termed zeitgebers (1). \n \n 2\nIn mammals, the master circadian clock resides within the suprachiasmatic nuclei \n(SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus (2,3).  For a number of years, it was believed that \nthe SCN represented one of only a few tissues capable of generating circadian \nrhythms; indeed, the SCN clock was believed to ultimately drive most rhythmic \nphysiological and behavioural rhythms.  However, circadian clocks have now been \nidentified in nearly all tissues (4,5) and even in immortalised cell lines (6).  These \nfindings have necessitated a change in the perception of the cellular organisation of \nthe clock, which is now conceptualised as an integrated circadian timing system (7) \n(Figure 1).  In this complex system, clocks present in peripheral tissues drive local \naspects of physiology.  These so-called peripheral clocks are synchronised by multiple \noutput pathways from the SCN (8), which thus retains its position as the master clock \nbut acts by co-ordinating daily rhythms throughout the body. \n \nThe molecular basis of the mammalian circadian clock has been reviewed in detail \nelsewhere (1).  In brief, the clock is based on transcriptional-translational feedback \nloops.  In the central clock loop, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors \nBMAL1 and CLOCK (or its paralog NPAS2) stimulate transcription of three Period \n(Per1-3) and two Cryptochrome (Cry1-2) genes via E-box elements within their \npromoter regions.  The translated PER and CRY proteins then form the basis of \ninhibitory complexes that translocate back into the nucleus and bind to CLOCK-\nBMAL1 proteins to inhibit their activity and thus the transcription of the Per and Cry \ngenes.  Within this cyclical process, the stability of PER and CRY proteins is tightly \ncontrolled by casein kinases (CK1\u03b4\/\u03b5) and the F-box protein FBXL3, respectively (9-\n15).  Such post-translational control is believed to be critical in determining the length \nof the molecular oscillations (16). \n 3\n Secondary feedback loops also exist within the circadian mechanism.  The best \ncharacterised of these drives rhythmical expression of Bmal1 via retinoic acid-related \norphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present within its promoter (17). In this \nloop, CLOCK-BMAL1 dimers stimulate the rhythmic transcription of Rev-erb\u03b1, \nwhich represses Bmal1 transcription following translation into REV-ERB\u03b1 protein.  \nThe purpose of these secondary loops is unclear but may provide additional \nrobustness to the primary loop or perhaps provide mechanisms through which \nexternal processes (e.g. metabolic state) may interact with circadian biology. \n \nIn order for the molecular clock mechanism described above to regulate cellular \nphysiology, it must be able to communicate temporal information to other \nintracellular pathways.  It is now recognised that core clock proteins not only regulate \nthe expression of other clock genes but also of output (or \u2018clock-controlled\u2019) genes by \nbinding to circadian promoter elements, including E-boxes and ROREs (18-20).  \nMany of these clock-controlled genes are themselves transcription factors that then \nregulate the expression of further downstream target genes; for example, the D-\nelement binding protein gene (Dbp) is rhythmically expressed via E-boxes in its \npromoter and the resulting circadian profile of DBP protein then rhythmically induces \ntranscription of downstream genes via activation of D-boxes.  Through such \nmechanisms, the circadian clock is believed to drive rhythmical expression of \napproximately 10% of the transcriptome of most tissues (21). \n \nFollowing from these advances in our knowledge of basic circadian mechanisms, \nimportance is now being attached to understanding how the circadian timing system \n 4\ninteracts with other physiological systems.  Indeed, one of the key challenges of the \nfield is to determine the functional role of circadian timing processes in health and \ndisease. \n \n \nLinking the clock to adipose function \n \nThere are multiple lines of evidence that suggest a close relationship between \ncircadian rhythms and adipose biology.  Indeed, multiple aspects of adipose-related \nphysiology display daily variation.  For instance, in humans 24-hour rhythms have \nbeen reported in the circulating blood-borne concentration of leptin and adiponectin \n(22,23), which are members of the fat-derived hormone family, the adipokines (24).  \nMost of these studies have been performed with the experimental subjects being kept \nin fluctuating external conditions, including a light-dark cycle.  As a result, the \nreported rhythms are not necessarily circadian in nature, as they may be in part driven \nby the presence of rhythmic zeitgebers.  However, the importance of endogenous \ncircadian mechanisms in driving circadian adipokine secretion has been demonstrated \nin rodent models, in which leptin and adiponectin secretion is dependent on a \nfunctional SCN and persists in constant darkness (25,26).  Whether human adipokine \nrhythms persist in the absence of environmental cues remains to be determined. \n \nFurther links between circadian and adipose physiology lie at the molecular level, in \ncellular, animal and human models.  There is now in vitro evidence to suggest that \nmultiple clock genes play a role in adipocyte differentiation.  Not only does the \nexpression of both Rev-erb\u03b1 and Bmal1 mRNA increase approximately 3-4 days \n 5\nfollowing the onset of differentiation of cultured adipocytes (27-28), but manipulation \nof gene expression in cultured cells indicates that they both promote the \ndifferentiation process (28-29).  However, their expression is apparently not necessary \nfor adipocyte differentiation in vivo as juvenile Bmal -\/- mice and adult Rev-erb\u03b1-\/- \nmice do not exhibit any gross adipose abnormalities compared to their respective wild \ntype controls (30-31). \n \nDespite the lack of gross adipose abnormalities in juvenile Bmal-\/- mice and adult Rev-\nerb\u03b1-\/- mice, many mutant mouse lines bearing genetic lesions of clock or clock-\nrelated genes exhibit abnormal lipid processing.  Mice expressing the dominant \nnegative allele Clock\u039419 on a C57BL\/6J background display many of the symptoms \nof metabolic syndrome, including adipocyte hypertrophy, hyperleptinemia, \nhyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia (32).  In \naddition, serum VLDL triglycerides and apolipoprotein C-III concentration are \nelevated in Rev-erb\u03b1-\/- mice (33), and mice with targeted disruption of the Nocturnin \ngene, which encodes a clock-controlled deadenylase, are resistant to diet-induced \nobesity (34).  Adult Bmal1-\/- mice exhibit a reduction of fat and other tissues, although \nthis may be due to premature ageing, rather than a specific abnormality of adipose \nphysiology per se (31). \n \nOne caveat when considering the metabolic phenotype of genetically altered mice is \nthe effect of genetic background on expression of the phenotype.  As has been \nreported in other models (35), the background genotype of mice appears to influence \nthe expressed metabolic phenotype of the Clock\u039419 mutation onto other mouse lines \n(36-37).  After crossing the Clock\u039419 mutation onto an ICR background, Oishi et al \n 6\nreported a reduction in dietary fat absorption and subsequent protection against \nobesity induced by a high fat diet.  Kennaway et al crossed the Clock\u039419 mutation \nonto a melatonin-proficient CBA line and reported a metabolic phenotype including \nelevated plasma adiponectin and reduced plasma free fatty acid concentration.  \nHowever, despite these phenotypic differences, a common thread through the studies \ndescribed above is that disruption of clock and clock-related genes induces metabolic \ndisruption and lipid homeostasis. \n \nBuilding on the rodent studies, a number of groups have now reported associations \nbetween metabolic disruption and polymorphisms of human clock genes.  Variants of \nBMAL1, NPAS2 and PER2 have been linked to components of metabolic syndrome, \nincluding hypertension and glucose dysregulation (38-39).  Moreover, studies of both \nBritish (40) and Argentinean (41) populations have investigated polymorphisms of the \nCLOCK gene and found significant relationships between CLOCK haplotypes and the \npresence of obesity and metabolic syndrome.  These data therefore complement the \nanimal studies and are consistent with an interaction between clock genes and lipid \nmetabolism.  \n \nFinally, consistent with the existence of a localised peripheral clock within WAT, \nrhythmical clock gene expression has been reported in adipose tissue.  These studies \nare discussed in detail below.  \n \n \nAdipose tissue rhythms \n \n 7\nRhythms in adipose tissue and the effect of diet \n \nAnalysis of murine adipose gene expression has revealed 24-hour rhythms of \nadipokine clock gene expression.  The relative phasing of gene expression in WAT is \nconsistent with SCN rhythms and the molecular model of the circadian clock \nsuggesting the presence of a circadian clock within WAT (42-43).  Moreover, use of \nmicroarrays suggests that up to 20% of the murine adipose transcriptome is expressed \naccording to a diurnal rhythm, with many of the identified genes being involved in \nmetabolism (43-44).  Similar data have also been reported with human WAT arrays, \nalbeit with a limited number of diurnal sampling time points (45).  It therefore appears \nthat many aspects of mammalian adipose biology are regulated on a 24 hour basis. \n \nInterestingly, WAT tissue rhythms are altered in obese individuals and are sensitive to \ndiet.  Ando et al compared rhythms of clock gene expression in WAT taken from \nthree mouse lines; one was lean, another was obese with mild type 2 diabetes mellitus \n(T2DM) and a third was obese with sever T2DM.  The data revealed markedly \nreduced rhythm amplitude in obese mouse lines, compared to lean mice (42).  This \nfinding has notable similarities with previous reports of reduced amplitude rhythms of \nplasma adipokines in obese human subjects (22,46-48), suggesting that rhythms of \nboth gene expression and endocrine activity may be attenuated in WAT of obese \nindividuals.   The role of diet on adipose rhythms has been investigated using \ndifferent experimental paradigms.  Administration of a high fat diet to mice for 6 \nweeks had multiple effects on circadian physiology, including a lengthening of the \nperiod of behavioural rhythms and also altered diurnal gene expression rhythms in \nboth WAT and liver (49).  Consistent with data relating to other peripheral tissues, \n 8\nrestriction of food availability to the light phase regulates the phase of adipose \nrhythms in mice (43).  Finally, in overweight human subjects, short-term fasting also \nalters diurnal human sub-cutaneous WAT rhythms (45).  Together, these data not only \nindicate a key role of daily rhythms in adipose function, but that there is a functional \nrelationship between metabolic state and the phasing and\/or robustness of adipose \nrhythms. \n \nDespite their importance in identifying molecular rhythms in adipose tissue, there are \nsome limitations with the above studies.  As with the reports of adipokine rhythms in \nhuman plasma, they were conducted in changing light-dark cycle and so the \ncontribution of endogenous timing mechanisms cannot be readily distinguished from \npossible masking effects of environmental rhythms.  Also, the complex composition \nof adipose tissue and its input pathways makes the cellular basis of adipose rhythms \nunclear.  These factors are discussed in detail below. \n \n \nWAT cellular heterogeneity \n \nAs with other tissues, WAT is comprised of multiple different cell types and this \nheterogeneity causes difficulty interpreting which cells contribute to rhythmicity at \nthe tissue level.  In addition to adipocytes and pre-adipocytes, WAT contains a wide \nvariety of cells that are believed to contain endogenous clocks (Table 1). \n \nOther potential confounding factors when interpreting rhythmicity in WAT are 1) the \ninflammatory state of the tissue and 2) the origin of the WAT explant.  One aspect of \n 9\nobesity is the chronic inflammatory state of adipose tissue (50).  During this time, the \nbalance of the WAT cellular composition changes, notably including an increase in \nthe macrophage content of the tissue.  It is now clearly understood that different \nadipose depots have markedly different influences over body metabolism; for \nexample, visceral WAT is a much better predictor of metabolic syndrome than \nsubcutaneous fat (51).  This differential function of adipose depots also appears to \nextend to circadian rhythmicity, as the phase of clock gene rhythms in adipose tissue \nis dependent upon anatomical location (52-53). \n \n \nRhythmical inputs \n \nAs with other peripheral tissues, WAT is subject to a variety of rhythmical input \nsignals (Figure 2).  Many of these inputs are neuroendocrine in origin; neuronal inputs \ninclude autonomic innervation; endocrine inputs include melatonin and \nglucocorticoids.  Other putative rhythmical inputs include feeding and paracrine \nfactors from other WAT cells, e.g. macrophage cytokines.  Although the likelihood of \nphysiological redundancy makes it difficult to identify the role of individual \nsignalling pathways in the synchronisation of WAT rhythms in vivo, there is evidence \nthat these neuroendocrine and behavioural rhythms are involved in the entrainment of \nat least some peripheral clocks. \n \nFeeding behaviour \n \n 10\nIt has been recognised for a number of years that temporal restriction of food \navailability acts as a powerful environmental time cue that regulates circadian \nrhythms (54).  In nocturnal rodents, restriction of food availability to the day time \nsynchronises rhythms of food anticipatory activity and gene expression in peripheral \ntissues, including WAT (43).  In most experimental models, the SCN remain \nentrained to the light-dark cycle, resulting in an uncoupling with many peripheral \ntissues.  However, in some mouse strains and during both temporal and caloric food \nrestriction, SCN rhythms also entrain to food availability (55-57). \n \nThe mechanisms through which temporal food availability regulate circadian clocks \nare poorly understood.  Changes in metabolite concentration are able to synchronise \ncultured cells in vitro (58) and so may also contribute to synchronisation in vivo.  \nFurthermore, there is a wealth of evidence supporting the existence of a food-\nentrainable oscillator (FEO), which lies outside of the SCN and is capable of driving \nphysiological and behavioural rhythms (54).  Although the location(s) of the FEO is \nthe subject of much current debate (59,60), its role within the circadian timing system \nis likely to be of great physiological importance. \n \nAutonomic innervation \n \nThe autonomic nervous system is a major physiological regulator of many peripheral \ntissues.  Neuronal outputs from the SCN directly regulate the activity of hypothalamic \npre-autonomic neurones, and thus the activity of the autonomic nervous system \nexhibits circadian changes (61).  In particular, sympathetic innervation has a key role \nin driving many peripheral rhythms, including pineal melatonin synthesis, hepatic \n 11\nglucose metabolism and adrenal corticosteroid secretion.   Interestingly, denervation \nof the sympathetic input to the submaxillary glands made these tissues more receptive \nto the synchronising effects of temporal food availability (62), indicating that a \ncomplex interaction between different physiological entraining stimuli may exist for \nperipheral clocks. \n \nThere is some controversy in the literature regarding the parasympathetic control of \nWAT (63,64).  However, clear evidence for sympathetic innervation of WAT function \nhas been available for many years (65).  This sympathetic innervation exerts \nphysiological control over WAT, for example increasing lipolysis, and may \nconceivably also entrain circadian rhythms in this tissue. \n \nMelatonin \n \nMelatonin is the primary product of the pineal gland and exhibits an extremely robust \ndaily rhythm of secretion, with elevated plasma melatonin concentration at night (66).  \nIn many model systems, melatonin has proven to be a powerful entraining signal for \ncircadian rhythms.  At the molecular level, much of our understanding of melatonin \nsignalling on circadian rhythms comes from studies of the pars tuberalis of the \nanterior pituitary.  In this tissue, melatonin signals through its MT1 receptor subtype \nto regulate the expression of multiple clock genes (67-69).  Furthermore, recent array \nstudies have demonstrated that melatonin is likely to have acute stimulatory and \ninhibitory effects on a wide range of signalling pathways (70,71). \n \n 12\nPinealectomy modifies sensitivity of rats to insulin, suggesting a role for melatonin in \nenergy balance in vivo (72).  Studies of cultured cells indicate that melatonin \nreceptors are expressed on adipocytes (73,74) and that melatonin may directly \nregulate lipolysis and leptin expression (74,75).  However, the ability of melatonin to \nregulate adipose rhythms is currently unknown. \n \nGlucocorticoids \n \nThe secretion of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex also exhibits a clear circadian \nrhythm, controlled by a combination of 1) SCN regulation of the hypothalamo-\npituitary-adrenal axis, 2) SCN regulation of autonomic input to the adrenal gland and \n3) rhythmic sensitivity to ACTH driven by a local adrenal clock (76).  Administration \nof the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone entrains liver clock gene \nrhythms in vivo (77) and can synchronise cultured cells, including fibroblasts and \nadipocytes, in vitro (78,79).  Interestingly, although physiological glucocorticoid \nsignalling does not appear to regulate liver expression of core clock genes, rhythmic \nexpression of a large proportion of cycling liver genes appears to be dependent upon a \nfunctional adrenal gland (80).  Moreover, liver-specific loss of glucocorticoid \nsignalling accelerates the entrainment of mice to a temporally restricted feeding \nparadigm (81).  Thus, there is evidence that both exogenous and endogenous \nglucocorticoid hormones are capable of regulating peripheral clock function. \n \n \nAdipocyte rhythmicity in vitro \n \n 13\nA recent study has investigated rhythmic gene expression in explants of human WAT.  \nHere, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue was removed from obese subjects, \nkept in tissue culture conditions overnight and then analysed every 6 hours over a 24 \nhour period (53).  Rhythmic expression was observed for selected clock genes and \nalso other adipose-related genes, consistent with the hypothesis that WAT contains its \nown autonomous clock.  However, it is still unclear from this study whether the clock \nlies in the adipocytes, or some other cell type(s).  In order to address this question, \nsome groups have begun to study cultures of adipose-derived cells. \n \nThe ability to use cultured cells to analyse circadian rhythms was first demonstrated \nusing hepatic fibroblast cultures (6).  Application of a \u2018pulse\u2019 of high serum \nconcentration or one of many pharmacological stimuli has been shown to induce \nmolecular rhythms within a cell population using many different cell types, including \nimmortalised cell lines (78).  Elegant analysis of single cell fibroblast rhythms using \nreporter constructs shows that the effect of the pulse is not to induce rhythmicity \nwithin cells, but rather to synchronise existing cellular rhythms that have drifted out \nof phase with one another (82,83). \n \nThe first study to apply the pulse technique to adipose physiology utilised human \nsubcutaneous adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs).  Following a 2-hour pulse with \neither dexamethasone, rosiglitazone or 30% foetal bovine serum, circadian expression \nof selected clock genes was observed in both undifferentiated and adipocyte-\ndifferentiated ASCs (79).  Similarly, a later study reported rhythms of Per1 and \nBmal1 mRNA in undifferentiated ASCs following a 1-hour pulse with 50% foetal \nbovine serum (84). \n 14\n We have taken a similar approach to investigate murine adipocyte rhythms and have \nstudied the well-characterised 3T3-L1 cell model (Otway, Frost, Johnston \nunpublished observations).  Although these cells are known to express clock genes \n(28,85), there are no available quantitative data describing temporal changes in their \nphysiology.  Our data are consistent with some of the ASC findings described above, \nbut also add extra levels of analysis and reveal some interesting differences.  \nConsistent with the ASC data (79,84), we observed rhythmical variation of Per2, Dbp \nand Rev-erb\u03b1 expression in pre-adipocytes.  However, we failed to observe circadian \nrhythmicity of other genes involved in the circadian clock (Per1, Cry1, Bmal1) or \nother aspects of adipocyte biology (PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1).  This result was \nsurprising given that all of the genes are rhythmic in murine WAT (42-44,86) and \ntherefore suggest that some of the reported rhythmicity in murine WAT may derive \nfrom non-adipocyte cell types and\/or rhythmical input signal(s). \n \nIn differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we found that expression of Per2, Dbp and Rev-\nerb\u03b1 were again rhythmic, but the other genes tested exhibited no obvious circadian \npattern.  Although the rhythmic expression of Rev-erb\u03b1 was similar to that in the pre-\nadipocytes, the amplitude of Per2 and Dbp rhythms was markedly attenuated.  The \nreason for this could potentially be due to attenuated intra-cellular rhythm amplitude \nor a decreased ability of the serum pulse to synchronise the cell population.  Finally, \nin contrast to a lack of circadian Leptin and Adiponectin mRNA expression, our data \nindicate that adipocyte clocks may drive circadian secretion of leptin, but not \nadiponectin.  Although the mechanism of circadian leptin secretion is currently \n 15\nunclear, this is the first indication of an adipocyte-based mechanism driving the \nplasma leptin rhythms described above. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThere is an increasing body of evidence linking circadian rhythms and clock genes \nwith adipose physiology and pathophysiology.  Despite the progress made in \nunderstanding adipose rhythms over the past few years, there are a number of \nimportant research avenues that remain to be explored.  Of particular importance will \nbe an understanding of rhythmic input pathways and intercellular communication, the \nrelationship between circadian and metabolic dysfunction, and the generation of cell- \nand tissue-specific clock knockout models.  Given the importance of obesity and \nmetabolic disease in contemporary society, a clearer understanding of the function of \nadipose clocks has great potential therapeutic value. \n 16\nReferences \n \n1.
