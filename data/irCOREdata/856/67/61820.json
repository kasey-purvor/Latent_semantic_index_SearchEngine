Xu et al.: Vertical and interhemispheric links in the stratosphere-mesosphere\n1 Introduction\nA pole-to-pole atmospheric circulation can be driven by\nthe dissipation of gravity waves (e.g. Fritts and Alexan-\nder, 2003). During the stratospherically undisturbed winter\nmonths in either hemisphere, the summer-to-winter merid-\nional circulation leads to a warm winter mesopause and a\ncold summer mesopause (e.g. Manson et al., 2002). The\nlatter provides opportunities for noctilucent clouds (NLC)\nor polar mesospheric clouds, and polar mesospheric sum-\nmer echoes. During sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW),\nwhich are defined as mid-winter events almost exclusively\noccurring in the Northern Hemisphere, variability and even\nreversal of this meridional flow may occur (e.g. Becker and\nFritts, 2006), associated with major changes in planetary\nwave (PW) and gravity wave (GW) activities in both hemi-\nspheres. A SSW may be major or minor: briefly, \u201cmajor\u201d\nif, at 10 hPa or below, the latitudinal mean temperature in-\ncreases poleward from 60 degrees latitude and an associated\nzonal mean wind reversal occurs (eastward to westward);\n\u201cminor\u201d if the warming event is regional, the polar vortex\nis less disturbed and the wind reversal is less extensive in\nlongitude and latitude. We also use the abbreviation MMW,\nstanding for Major Mid-winter Warming. For clarification,\nnote that a MMW is a major SSW while a SSW might be\nmajor or minor.\nThere is growing evidence in recent years that the Arc-\ntic atmosphere is linked dynamically and thence chemically\nwith the Antarctic atmosphere. Modeling studies such as\nthose by Becker et al. (2004) and Becker and Fritts (2006)\naddressed how gravity waves could have driven an interhemi-\nspheric coupling in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere\n(MLT) during the MaCWAVE\/MIDAS northern summer pro-\ngram of 2002. They linked several anomalies observed in\nthe Northern Hemisphere (NH) polar summer MLT during\n2002 to unusually high planetary wave activity in the South-\nern Hemisphere (SH) winter. This was a historically unique\nSH winter (e.g. Chshyolkova et al., 2006), since a major\nSSW occurred. Karlsson et al. (2007) found a strong anti-\ncorrelation between winter stratospheric temperatures and\nsummer mesospheric NLC occurrences based on the year-\nto-year variability of the monthly means over 5 years. Such\nan interhemispheric link was also reproduced by the use of\ntemperature simulations from the extended Canadian Middle\nAtmosphere Model (CMAM) (Karlsson et al., 2009). Both\nof these studies confirmed that the source for an anoma-\nlous stratosphere e.g. one having a warmer monthly temper-\nature than average in a given year, is the enhanced plane-\ntary wave flux entering the winter stratosphere; but following\nthat an anomaly in gravity-wave drag arises, through chang-\ning wind-filtering conditions, leading to an anomalously cool\nmonth in the winter mesopause region. The meridional\nwinds between the polar-regions are therefore weakened or\nreversed, resulting in relative warming of the summer polar\nmesopause.\nInterhemispheric propagation of PWs is also possible.\nChshyolkova et al. (2006) noted that with favourable con-\nditions, PWs with \u223c10-, 16- and 25-day periods can pen-\netrate to the opposite hemisphere at stratospheric heights\nand further propagate upward to mesospheric heights during\nequinoxes. This has also been supported by modeling studies\n(Forbes et al., 1995; Miyoshi, 1999) which showed that a tie\nexists between the two hemispheres.\nSome attention has been paid to the interhemispheric sta-\ntionary planetary wave (SPW)-tidal connections recently.\nThese studies were incited by the report that the nonlinear in-\nteractions between the migrating semidiurnal tide (s=2) and\nthe SPW (S=1) could produce the nonmigrating semidiur-\nnal tide (e.g. Angelats i Coll and Forbes, 2002). Baumgaert-\nner et al. (2005) compared the seasonal sequences of plan-\netary wave amplitudes with amplitudes of the semidiurnal\ntide at Scott Base (78\u25e6 S, 167\u25e6 E) and pointed out that plan-\netary waves in both the SH and NH are partly responsible\nfor the seasonal variability of the SH semidiurnal tide via the\ngeneration of a s=1 semidiurnal tide. Based on observations\nat Scott Base and at Halley (76\u25e6 S, 26\u25e6 W), Baumgaertner\net al. (2006) further showed that the amplitudes of the non-\nmigrating semidiurnal tide (s=1) were positively correlated\nwith the NH SPW near 1 hPa during the SH summer months,\nbut also with the SH SPW near 10 hPa during SH winter.\nMost recently, Smith et al. (2007) provided evidence for a\ncorrelation between variability of the mesospheric semidiur-\nnal tide in the NH and the quasi-stationary planetary wave\n(S=1) in the SH stratosphere during NH summer and fall.\nTheir interpretation is that the SPW in the SH interacts with\nthe global semidiurnal migrating tide and produces nonmi-\ngrating semidiurnal tides that vary in time in concert with the\nSH planetary wave. Smith et al. (2007) used the semidiurnal\ntidal data only at Esrange (68\u25e6 N, 21\u25e6 E). However, longitu-\ndinal and latitudinal variations in the tidal (24-h and 12-h)\namplitudes and phases are present in most cases (e.g. Man-\nson et al., 2002). In addition, the low and high frequency\nprocesses, or in other words seasonal trends and the shorter\ntime-scale oscillations respectively, were not distinguished\nin these correlation studies. Therefore, additional work is\nnecessary for a better understanding of the interhemispheric\nSPW-tidal coupling processes. This is the subject of scrutiny\nin another paper by the present authors (Xu et al., 2009).\nThis work assesses the interhemispheric coupling pro-\ncesses based upon the temporal variability of temperature\nobservations. There have so far been fewer interhemispheric\ncoupling studies using the day-to-day variability of tempera-\nture observations with considerations of the statistical signifi-\ncance of trends in temperature sequences from disparate parts\nof the atmosphere. Continuous Aura-MLS temperature mea-\nsurements with near global view (latitude coverage 82\u25e6 S\u2013\n82\u25e6 N) allow investigation of the pole-to-pole atmospheric\nconnection through the day-to-day variability of the obser-\nvations. The most dramatic events in the mid-winter polar\nmiddle atmosphere are the sudden breakdowns or splitting of\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 3387\u20133409, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/\nX. Xu et al.: Vertical and interhemispheric links in the stratosphere-mesosphere 3389\nthe polar vortex in the NH and the associated minor and ma-\njor warmings in the stratosphere (e.g. Manson et al., 2008).\nThe objective of this study is to identify the response of the\nsummer Antarctic mesospheric temperature to disturbances\nat the mid-winter Arctic stratospheric altitudes. The winter\nstratospheric disturbances often have durations of only a few\ndays, so that several events can occur within a given month.\nTherefore, the day-to-day variability can potentially reveal\nthe summer mesosphere-response of the winter stratospheric\npolar vortex and warming events better than the year-to-year\nmonthly mean (e.g. Karlsson et al., 2007, 2009).\nThis study also looks at the local mesosphere-responses to\nthe winter stratospheric disturbances since intra-hemispheric\nstratosphere-mesosphere connection (i.e. spatially varying\nvertical connection) is often the foundation of interhemi-\nspheric stratosphere-mesosphere linkage. The vertical con-\nnection has been widely studied (e.g. Jacobi et al., 1997,\n2003; Walterscheid et al., 2000; Hoffmann et al., 2002;\nChshyolkova et al., 2005; Dowdy et al., 2007; Manson et\nal., 2008), but will be highlighted by the use of the larger\nobservational dataset in this work.\nThis work is based on the day-to-day variability of tem-\nperature measurements by Aura-MLS covering the win-\nters 2004\/2005\u20132007\/2008 and supplemented by the UKMO\n(also called MetO) assimilated data as well as mesospheric\nwinds from MF radars. Section 2 will briefly describe the\ndataset. In Sect. 3 the winter characteristics and vertical cou-\npling will be addressed. Section 4 will focus on the inter-\nhemispheric coupling. Finally a discussion and summary\nwill be made in Sect. 5.\n2 Data\nThe data used in this work are from the same sources as those\nin Chshyolkova et al. (2007), so only brief descriptions are\nmade here. More information on the data can be found in\nChshyolkova et al. (2007) and references therein.\n2.1 Aura-MLS temperature\nThe temperatures used here are version 2.2 data by the Mi-\ncrowave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board the National Aero-\nnautic and Space Administration (NASA) Aura satellite. The\nAura satellite is sun synchronous with \u223c90 min orbital pe-\nriod. The daily data are available starting in August 2004\nand have latitude coverage from 82\u25e6 S to 82\u25e6 N. The useful\naltitude range is 316\u20130.001 hPa (\u223c8\u201397 km) with precision\nranging from 0.6 K in the lower stratosphere to 2.5 K in the\nmesosphere and approximately 3 to 6 km steps depending on\nheight. In this paper, zonal mean temperature and tempera-\nture planetary waves (PW) are constructed in latitude bands\nwith 5\u25e6 width. In order to investigate longitudinal difference\nin correlation plots, the data are also further sorted into lon-\ngitude sectors of 20\u25e6. The daily temperature is obtained by\naveraging over a 3-day window which is stepped by 1-day\ninterval. We can expect some aliasing effects on the zonal\nmean temperatures from the migrating tides. However, note\nthat since Aura is in a sun synchronous orbit, its samples\nare stationary with respect to migrating tides. These should\nappear as constant offsets to the measurements at a particu-\nlar latitude. If the means are subtracted, the migrating tides\ntheoretically should be removed. Therefore, the aliasing ef-\nfect on the correlation result is negligible. In addition, in\nthe stratosphere and lower mesosphere, the tides are usually\nweak so the tidal contamination is also weak.\n2.2 UKMO data\nThe UKMO (United Kingdom Meteorological Office, also\nknown as MetO) data are the result of assimilation of op-\nerational meteorological measurements from satellites, ra-\ndiosondes and aircrafts into a numerical forecasting model\nof the stratosphere and troposphere. The UKMO data have\nbeen widely used to describe the state of the stratosphere (e.g.\nO\u2019Neill et al., 1994; Chshyolkova et al., 2005, 2006, 2007;\nManson et al., 2008). In this paper, we use UKMO temper-\natures and horizontal wind components to describe the state\nof winter stratospheric circulation and polar vortex.\n2.3 MF radar data\nDaily mean meridional winds from MF (medium frequency)\nradars (e.g. Troms\u00f8 (70\u25e6 N, 19\u25e6 E), Saskatoon (52\u25e6 N,\n253\u25e6 E)) are used to examine responses of the mesospheric\ncirculation to stratospheric disturbances. Daily mean winds\nare obtained by a least-squares fit of the mean, 24-, and 12-\nh tidal components to the hourly mean radar measurements.\nThe fitting uses a window of 3 days shifted by 1 day.\n3 Polar vortex characteristics and vertical linkage in the\nstratosphere-mesosphere\nIn this section, the characterization of the vortex for each\nwinter is completed to provide perspective for the statistical\nanalyses in the next section. This is necessary; in particular\nlongitudinal asymmetry of the vortex and hence atmosphere\nhas largely been ignored by earlier researchers in the corre-\nlation analysis. Also this can inform the readers who wish to\nlearn some new aspects of the atmosphere in these winters.\nThe detailed descriptions are presented mainly for the last\ntwo winters (2006\/2007 and 2007\/2008). For the two earlier\nwinters (2004\/2005 and 2005\/2006), more information about\nthe vortex were given in our recent studies (Chshyolkova et\nal., 2007, 2009; Manson et al., 2008).\nThe vertical connection has been widely studied. How-\never, the \u201cestablished knowledge\u201d has often been based upon\ndata from 2 heights, stratosphere and some emission line in\nthe mesosphere (e.g., Walterscheid et al., 2000) or the re-\nsponse of a single parameter such as the mesospheric wind\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/ Ann.

Here we\nuse data of multi-years (4 winters), more variables (temper-\nature, heat flux, planetary wave amplitude, mesospheric and\nstratospheric winds) and higher vertical resolution (\u223c3\u20136 km\nfrom tropopause to upper mesosphere).\n3.1 2004\/2005 winter\nThe winter stratosphere of 2004\/2005 has been described\n(e.g. Manney et al., 2006; Manson et al., 2008) as cold and\nwith a strong polar vortex, i.e. zonal mean lower stratospheric\ntemperatures were generally cold, with no MMW. This win-\nter was also typified as having a \u201ccold\u201d 30 hPa polar atmo-\nsphere in December and January (statistics from the Institute\nof Meteorology, Free University of Berlin \u201cFUB\u201d).\nManson et al. (2008, Fig. 9) discussed 2004\/2005 and\n2005\/2006 differences: the planetary wave breaking oc-\ncurred at lower stratospheric heights in December 2004,\nleading to a cold mid-winter middle-upper stratosphere and\nthe absence of a major SSW. Appropriately (Labitzke et\nal., 2006), the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO) was in its\n\u201cwesterly wind\u201d phase. Despite the above, 2004\/2005 was\nnot simple dynamically (Chshyolkova et al., 2007). Like\nmore than 50% of all years (Harvey et al., 2002) there was\na regional or minor warming in the Pacific Western-Canada,\nwhich in 2004 was associated with a very strong and deep\nAleutian stratospheric anticyclone. This anticyclone led to a\nsmaller but very cold, strong, and distorted vortex lying over\nScandinavia-Western Europe in January and February.\nFigure 1 shows the day-to-day variability of derived quan-\ntities in winter 2004\/2005. It is in most respects a figure of\nclassical content and design, as used in reports from the FUB\nbefore 2002. The bottom panel (Fig. 1d) is for the zonally\naveraged meridional eddy heat flux (v\u2032T \u2032) at lower strato-\nspheric heights (30 hPa, 60\u201365\u25e6 N). As mentioned in New-\nman et al. (2001) and references therein, the eddy heat flux\nis proportional to the vertical group velocity of a planetary\nwave. The eddy heat flux for a particular wave is proportional\nto the square of the wave amplitude and the vertical and zonal\nwavenumbers. Since the eddy heat flux is almost always pos-\nitive, the wave energy is always propagating vertically from\nthe troposphere to the stratosphere. Hence the eddy heat flux\nis an estimate for the upward propagating PW activity from\ntroposphere. Figure 1d shows three disturbances, occurring\nnear 1 January, and 1 and 25 February. There are correspond-\ning increases at 10 hPa in the zonal mean temperatures at\nhigh polar latitudes (Fig. 1b), and decreases or reversals of\nthe zonal mean winds at high latitudes (Fig. 1a). The plan-\netary wave number 1 (PW1) amplitudes at 10 hPa (Fig. 1c)\nare also large near 1 and 25 February, but not all disturbances\nin the heat flux are exhibited in the stratospheric PW1 since\nthe heat flux includes contributions from all waves. There is\nconsiderable evidence that amplified planetary scale distur-\nbances in the winter stratosphere can be traced into the tro-\nposphere (Quiroz, 1979; Randel, 1987; Liberato et al., 2007).\nThe stratospheric PW1 amplitudes are nearly in-phase\nwith the mean meridional temperature gradient during the\nwhole winter period, the former slightly leading the latter\n(Fig. 1c). Around 25 February, the strongest disturbance of\nthis winter, an enhanced PW1 reversed the meridional tem-\nperature gradient, leading to a warming stratosphere and a\ncooling mesosphere in the polar region (Fig. 1b). Both mean\nstratospheric zonal wind and Saskatoon mesospheric merid-\nional flow were reversed as well near this date (Fig. 1a). The\nmeridional wind in the mesosphere over Saskatoon (52\u25e6 N,\n253\u25e6 E) also showed clear fluctuations to stratospheric dis-\nturbances near 1 January and 1 February, further indicating\nmesospheric responses to the stratospheric disturbances.

Xu et al.: Vertical and interhemispheric links in the stratosphere-mesosphere 3391\nshould be noted that the response of mesospheric wind to\nthe stratospheric disturbances has longitudinal dependence.\nThe longitudinal differences are related to the relative posi-\ntion of the cyclone (vortex) and the anticyclone. During this\nwinter, the Canada-Saskatoon MF radar observed clear re-\nsponses of mesospheric meridional winds to the stratospheric\ndisturbances because of stratospheric warmings in that lon-\ngitudinal (the Pacific Western-Canada) sector (Manson et al.,\n2008).\n3.2 2005\/2006 winter\nMoving to the 2005\/2006 winter, the planetary wave break-\ning occurred at the upper stratospheric heights in December\n2005, leading to a warmer mid-winter middle-upper strato-\nsphere and weaker winds than in December 2004, and the\npresence of a major SSW (Manson et al., 2008; FUB statis-\ntics). The major SSW event occurred around 22\u201325 Jan-\nuary, accompanied by a zonal mean mesospheric cooling\nand the reversal of the stratospheric zonal mean zonal wind\n(Fig. 2). Also at Troms\u00f8 (70\u25e6 N, 19\u25e6 E) the MF radar ob-\nserved a strong southward wind near this event (dashed line\nin Fig. 2a). There were several hemispheric stratospheric\ndisturbances prior to the MMW (they began in late Decem-\nber), which were followed by extremely low temperatures\nin the stratosphere and extremely high temperatures in the\nmesosphere (Fig. 2b). Similar descriptions were also pre-\nsented in recent studies (e.g. Manney et al., 2008; Coy et\nal., 2009). It is important to remember that these low and\nhigh temperatures were zonal mean values. During Jan-\nuary 2006, the stratospheric zonal mean zonal wind showed\na weakening trend from eastward to westward flows, with\nsuperimposed short term oscillations (solid line in Fig. 2a),\nwhich are associated with the MMW and its earlier strato-\nspheric disturbances. The PW1 (Fig. 2c) and meridional heat\nfluxes (Fig. 2d) feature related variability, but the lack of de-\ntailed visual positive correlation indicate the complexity of\nthe hemispheric spatial structures that contributed to the var-\nious zonal means.\nIndeed, the vortex was significantly disturbed and dis-\ntorted during January 2006, which contributed to the se-\nquence of zonal mean temperature disturbances (Fig. 2 and\nChshyolkova et al., 2009). The Aleutian anticyclone was\nmore toward the western Pacific this year than in 2004\/2005,\nand during the MMW event the anticyclone moved further\nwest and literally slid within and under the existing vor-\ntex. This resulted in warm polar temperatures, and reversed\nstratospheric westward winds at the majority of mid-latitude\nlongitudes, which is an indicator of significant zonal symme-\ntry. However the longitudinal asymmetries before the MMW\nwere significant, with Scandinavia (Pacific) being respect-\nfully colder (warmer) in the middle stratosphere, but warmer\n(colder) from stratosphere into mesosphere (Chshyolkova et\nal., 2009; Figs. 7 and 8). The effects of these asymmetries\nwill be demonstrated later in the correlation plots.\n 35\n \n \n \nFig. 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2.

This latter is notable as the QBO was in\nits westerly phase, and occurrence of this MMW broke\nthe sequence of MMW-events during the QBO-easterly\nphases, which existed from 2003\/2004. This tendency\nhas been reviewed again by Labitzke (2005). Compari-\nson of the Eastern Canada-Atlantic-Europe and Pacific lon-\ngitudinal quadrants indicates strong temperature asymme-\ntries at mid-stratospheric heights (\u223c30 km) and mesospheric\nheights, with warmer (colder) values in the Pacific at mid-\nstratospheric (mesospheric) altitudes. Figure 3 shows the\nthree largest disturbances occurring at 10 hPa near 2 Jan-\nuary, 5 and 24 February. For the disturbance of 2 January,\nthe mesosphere showed a clear response with cooling and a\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3387\u20133409, 2009\n3392 X.

There was no short\nterm mesospheric thermal effect of the minor SSW near 5\nFebruary (Fig. 3b), although the four other parameters for\n30 and 10 hPa (Fig. 3a, c and d) showed appropriate re-\nsponses. Nevertheless, this event did occur in the middle of\nan overall mesospheric cooling trend. During the major SSW\nnear 24 February, reversals of stratospheric zonal wind and\nmesospheric meridional wind were observed (Fig. 3a), al-\nthough no obvious mesospheric cooling event occurred. This\nspeaks to the longitudinal variability and complexity of upper\nheights of the major SSW. Between the disturbances around\n2 January and 5 February, and based upon mean 10 hPa tem-\nperatures at 60\u201365\u25e6 N for two longitudinal sectors (Pacific\nand eastern Canada-central Russian; not shown) hemispheric\nsymmetry was re-established and the polar vortex apparently\nrecovered near 12 January. These features will influence the\nresults in the correlation plots in the next section.\nAs is to be expected, in this winter the vortex was again\nsignificantly distorted, especially near the dates discussed\nabove. Four typical and appropriate vortices are shown in\nFig. 4: 12 January, between the first two thermal disturbances\nwhen zonal symmetry is strongest; disturbed vortices on 3\nand 23 February; and the vortex for another intermediate date\nof 16 February. It should be noted that the date of a vortex\nbest representing an event (circa 15\u201350 km) differs slightly\nfrom the date of a peak in 10 hPa zonal mean temperature\ntime sequences. It is interesting that on 12 January the vor-\ntex was centered on the pole, approaches circularity, has little\nvertical tilt, and yet there was still a multi-height anticyclone\ncentered near 800 K\/30 km over the Pacific. For the two\nFebruary disturbances the vortices at lowest heights (450\u2013\n550 K, 16\u201322 km) were centered over Scandinavia, with vari-\nable extensions into the Atlantic and\/or Russia sectors, and\nwith westward tilts with increasing height. On 3 February\nthe vortex at 2000 K\/50 km extended over Canada, and the\nAleutian anticyclone was centered over the western Pacific-\nJapan. The latter extended from 600\u20131600 K (24\u201343 km).\nThe vortex-tilt is less during the major SSW (23 February\nis shown), the pole is actually outside the vortex, and the\nAleutian anticyclone was centered over the central northern\nPacific. As expected, between these two events (16 Febru-\nary), the vortex was more closely centered on the pole, but it\nwas more elliptical because of two anticyclones near 0\u25e6 and\n180\u25e6 E longitude.\nThe height-latitude temperature contours for 20\u25e6\u00b112.5\u25e6 E\nand 180\u25e6\u00b112.5\u25e6 E longitude sectors were derived from Aura-\nMLS (Fig. 5): the dates are for three days centered on the\ntwo February warming events, and the 11\u201313 January sym-\nmetrical condition. We have chosen longitudes that pass\nthrough the vortex and the Aleutian anticyclone for each of\nthe three dates, so that contrasts in temperatures up to the\nmesosphere can be distinguished. The zonal means (left side)\nare subtracted from the values for the two events to even bet-\nter distinguish the thermal conditions appropriate to the cy-\nclone (near 20\u25e6 E, middle of the figure) and the anticyclone\n(near 180\u25e6 E, right side). The stratosphere (mesosphere) over\nScandinavia-western Europe is still very cold (warm) dur-\ning the 4\u20136 February warming days and even for SSW days\n(23\u201325 February). Conversely the Pacific sector has reverse\ntemperature tendencies. The zonal mean sections of Fig. 5\nshow the contrast between the cold polar stratospheric tem-\nperatures during the undisturbed 11\u201313 January days and the\nincreasingly warm polar temperatures during the minor and\nthen major warmings.\n3.4 2007\/2008 winter\nThis winter was also typified by the FUB as having colder\nthan average 30 hPa polar temperatures in December and\nJanuary, with a MMW in February. The Eastern Canada-\nAtlantic-Europe and Pacific longitudinal quadrants again\nindicated significant asymmetry at 60\u201365\u25e6 N, with higher\n10 hPa temperatures in the Pacific quadrant during strato-\nspheric disturbances in January and February.

The sev-\neral disturbances cause the alternating occurrence of warm-\ning and cooling at stratospheric heights in January and Febru-\nary (solid line in Fig. 6b). The mesospheric zonal mean\ntemperature shows a clear anti-phase with them during this\nperiod (dashed line in Fig. 6b). Both stratospheric zonal\nwind and mesospheric meridional wind were found to be re-\nversed when the MMW appeared near 23 February (Fig. 6a).\nSimilar to 2005\/2006 winter, the stratospheric zonal mean\nzonal wind shows a reversal trend from eastward to west-\nward flows with superimposed short term oscillations (solid\nline in Fig. 6a) during the occurrence of the MMW and the\nseveral earlier disturbances.\nThe vortex was again significantly distorted, especially\nnear the dates discussed above. Four vortices, which are\nportrayed from 450 K\/16 km to 2000 K\/48 km, are shown in\nFig. 7: 26 January, near the end of the first temperature-\ndisturbance of Fig. 6, when the vortex was strongly ellip-\ntical with the major axis lying through the 90\u25e6 and 270\u25e6 E\nsectors, and when the Pacific anticyclone was strongest; 9\nFebruary during the second 10 hPa disturbance of Fig. 6; 11\nFebruary when the Pacific 10 hPa-temperatures had rapidly\ncooled; and finally on 23 February at the peak of the major\nSSW. Throughout this time the preferred orientations of the\nvortex-major axes in the lower stratosphere were within the\nranges 45\u201390\u25e6 E and 225\u2013270\u25e6 E, especially during the dis-\nturbances of Fig. 6. After 26 January, the vortex returned to\na position in these ranges and with similar structure on the\n9 February; there were rapid vortex-distortions as a Pacific-\ncooling occurred for a few days (11 February), and anticy-\nclones are evident at several longitudes besides the Pacific;\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/ Ann.

See text for details.\nand variability within these ranges continued until the ma-\njor SSW near 23 February, when warm air presided near the\npole in the lower to middle stratosphere. The complexity of\nthe vortex-shapes is due to anti-cyclones, again seen at sev-\neral longitudes besides the Pacific. On 23 February the vortex\nhas little vertical tilt from 15\u201350 km.\nThe height-latitude temperature contours for 20\u25e6\u00b112.5\u25e6 E\nand 250\u25e6\u00b112.5\u25e6 E longitude sectors were again derived from\nAura-MLS (Fig. 8): the dates are chosen from Fig. 7. As for\n2006\/2007 we have chosen two longitude-sectors that pass\nthrough the vortex and the Aleutian anticyclone on all four\ndates, so that contrasts in temperatures up to the mesosphere\ncan be distinguished. The zonal means (left side) are sub-\ntracted from the values for the two longitudes to even better\ndistinguish the thermal conditions appropriate to the cyclonic\nvortex (middle of the figure) and the anticyclone (right side).\nWithin the vortex during the first two disturbances, and even\nthe relative cooling (11\u201312 February), the entire stratosphere\nis cool relative to air in the anticyclone. Conversely the air of\nthe vortex-mesosphere is relatively warm compared with that\nof the Pacific anticyclone. The situation during the MMW\n(22\u201324 February) is more complex, with the vortex continu-\ning to have relatively cool air in the lower stratosphere (com-\npared with the Pacific anticyclone), a warmer region (30\u2013\n60 km) centered on the stratopause, and a cool mesosphere.\nThe zonal mean sections of Fig. 8 provide temperatures con-\nsistent with the zonal means of Fig. 6. Only 22\u201324 February,\nduring the major SSW, has warm polar stratospheric air; on\nthe other dates the polar stratospheric air is cooler than that at\nmiddle latitudes.

Walterscheid et\nal. (2000) reported that the mesospheric cooling preceded the\nwarming in the lower stratosphere. Figure 9 shows time-\nsequences of the 80\u201385\u25e6 N zonal mean temperature at 10,\n0.01, 0046, 0.0021 and 0.001 hPa for the four winters. One\ncan see for most pronounced stratospheric disturbances (e.g.\naround 25 February 2005; 13 and 24 January 2006; 1 Jan-\nuary 2007; 22 January and 5 February 2008), the middle\nmesosphere (\u223c80 km) usually showed a simultaneous cool-\ning while in the upper mesosphere (>85 km) the cooling of-\nten occurred slightly (1 or 2 days) earlier than the beginning\nof the warming in the stratosphere.\nFollowing discussions by Walterscheid et al. (2000), a rea-\nsonable explanation for why the upper mesospheric cooling\nprecedes the stratospheric warming disturbance is as follows.\nThe amplification of SPW (mainly S=1 and S=2) results in\nnorthward heat transport and vertical motion during strato-\nspheric disturbances. Initially, the upper mesosphere be-\ncomes cooled as a result of the upward forcing from below,\nwhile in the stratosphere the adiabatic cooling due to the up-\nward motion is balanced by northward heat transport. The\nstratospheric warming does not occur until the heat trans-\nport overwhelms the adiabatic cooling. GW propagation into\nthe MLT is also affected by the changing background winds\ndue to PW, which produce longitudinal variations in atmo-\nspheric parameters (Figs. 4 and 7). GCM models with data\nassimilation will be useful in assessing these lower and upper\natmospheric behaviours, which might be also related to dif-\nferences between gravity wave fluxes and momentum depo-\nsition in the lower mesosphere and in the upper mesosphere.\nThe impacts of this time shift will be demonstrated later in\nthe correlation plots of short term variations.\n4 Interhemispheric coupling in the stratosphere-\nmesosphere\n4.1 Year-to-year variability of monthly zonal mean\ntemperature\nInvestigations in this paper on interhemispheric linkage are\nthrough a series of correlation analyses. This work focuses\non correlation analysis with the daily temperatures. How-\never, before we show that, we want to demonstrate whether\nthe Aura-MLS temperature data used here can reproduce the\nresults of others. Following Karlsson et al. (2007, 2009),\nwe perform correlation analysis based on the year-to-year\n 39\n \n \n \n \nFig. 6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 6.

Figure 10 shows\nthe correlations of monthly averaged zonal mean tempera-\nture at each latitude and height throughout the global mid-\ndle atmosphere with respect to the same parameter at the\nAntarctic summer mesopause over the 5 winters (2004\/2005\u2013\n2008\/2009). Here we also choose the summer mesopause\nregion as the fixed sequence for each height-latitude correla-\ntion plot due to the relatively stable spatial (latitude and alti-\ntude) thermal-variability compared to the winter hemisphere.\nThe results indicate a strong positive (negative) correlation of\nthe summer Antarctic mesopause region with the winter Arc-\ntic stratosphere (lower-middle mesosphere) for the month of\nJanuary (the middle panel of Fig. 10). Such an interhemi-\nspheric connection is consistent with the results found by\nKarlsson et al. (2007, 2009). It is also not surprising that the\nwinters of NH polar stratospheric temperatures exhibited sig-\nnificant variability, based upon the materials (Figs. 1\u20133 and\n6) and discussion in Sect. 3: 2004\/2005 was cooler than av-\nerage with very large ozone destruction; 2005\/2006 warmer\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/ Ann.

To assess this we\nrepeated the monthly mean correlations for December and\nFebruary. The month with cleanest partitions between +\/\u2212\ncorrelations was December (left side of Fig. 10), when few\nif any SSW\/stratospheric disturbances occur; January (mid-\ndle of Fig. 10) was still very clean, but less well partitioned,\nlikely due to the occurrence of a few SSW; February (right\nside of Fig. 10), which experienced most of the SSW, was\nquite noisy. When a winter stratosphere is little disturbed,\nthe cold\/warm relationship among different parts of the mid-\ndle atmosphere is relatively stable, i.e. cooler winter strato-\nsphere, warmer winter mesosphere and cooler summer meso-\nsphere. The occurrence of SSWs in the winter hemisphere\nwill cause distinctive and strong responses in both winter\nand summer mesospheres. However, the duration of a SSW\n(typically \u223c10 days) is generally much less than a month.\nFor example, if the first half of a month experiences a ma-\njor SSW and recovery leads to a strong polar vortex in the\nsecond half, then the monthly average of the winter strato-\nsphere would be in a state between that of a warmer and\na colder. The monthly averages of the summer and winter\nmesopauses will also be in a state between that of a warmer\nand a colder, which plus the frequent longitudinal asymme-\ntry, would make the cold\/warm relation unstable and thus the\ncorrelations less clear. Therefore, it is not surprising that the\nDecember has the cleanest partitions between +\/\u2212 correla-\ntions while the February was noisy, which is consistent with\nthe argument made at the start of this paragraph.\nAnn.

Hence\nwe can expect to be able to identify the influence on the sum-\nmer mesosphere of the winter disturbances. These time inter-\nvals will also be used for the subsequent correlation analyses\nand figures. In this paper, a Monte-Carlo shuffling method\nis applied to estimate the significance of correlation (e.g.\nEbisuzaki, 1997; Usoskin et al., 2006). This spectral method\nensures that the significances are appropriate to the degrees\nof freedom existing in each of the time sequences and hence\ncorrelations.\nInspection of Fig. 11 indicates that positive (negative) cor-\nrelation coefficient values are generally observed in (above)\nthe lower-middle stratosphere (\u223c16\u201340 km) over high north-\nern latitudes during these winters. Compared to other win-\nters, the 2006\/2007 winter shows weak positive correlation\nin the middle mesosphere (\u223c75 km) and a smaller area of\npositive (negative) correlation in (above) the lower-middle\nstratosphere (\u223c16\u201340 km) for high northern latitudes. No\nsignificant correlation is found in the middle-upper meso-\nsphere (80\u201397 km) over high northern latitudes in winters\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3387\u20133409, 2009\n3400 X. Xu et al.: Vertical and interhemispheric links in the stratosphere-mesosphere\n2005\/2006 and 2007\/2008. Other clear features are the\nnegative and significant correlations in the stratosphere and\nlower mesosphere of the SH summer, in comparison with the\nmiddle-upper mesosphere. Both of these areas of significant\ncorrelation extend out to low-middle latitudes (circa 30\u25e6 S).\nThis is interesting, as anti-correlations between temperature\nvariations in stratosphere and mesosphere are usually not the\nsubject of discussion in the summer hemisphere. Presum-\nably the summer stratosphere is generally warmer due to\nlong hours of insolation, and the mesosphere cooler due to\nthe GW-driven northward flow toward the Arctic (Lindzen,\n1981). The correlations in Fig. 11 are showing variations\nabout those mean states. Finally, in the winter hemisphere, at\nlatitudes outside the polar vortex (circa 50\u25e6 N) and extending\nto the equator, there are areas of significant anti-correlation\nwith height-regions within the vortex. These will be asso-\nciated with variations in the strength of the Brewer-Dobson\nCirculation (Salby, 1996; Shepherd, 2000).\nThe significant positive correlation coefficients in the po-\nlar winter stratosphere indicate that when the polar win-\nter stratosphere gets warmer, the polar summer mesosphere\ngets warmer too. This link matches with the interhemi-\nspheric connection suggested on the basis of model studies\nor the year-to-year variability of monthly averaged observa-\ntions (e.g. Becker and Fritts, 2006; Karlsson et al., 2007,\n2009). The intermediary phenomenon is the variable merid-\nional flow, which is initially forced by GW, such that air-\nflows into the winter mesosphere are weakened or reversed,\nleading to winter mesospheric cooling. However, we must\nbe careful in the interpretation of such a connection because\nthese correlations in Fig. 11 are dominated by the low fre-\nquency variability (i.e. the seasonal trend) in the sequences.\nWe find similar correlation patterns (not shown) if only low\nfrequency variability in zonal mean temperature sequence is\nused. Because of this, these correlations are not sensitive to\nthe time lag between the sequences, i.e. the correlation coef-\nficient varies little over a wide range of time lags. Hence, for\nthe original sequences of zonal mean temperature (Fig. 11),\ncorrelations have been calculated with simultaneous time se-\nries.\n4.3 Short-term variations in daily zonal mean\ntemperature\nIn order to see what the correlation looks like for the high\nfrequency variability (i.e. the short term variations), we have\nremoved the trend from the temperature sequences. The de-\ntrended value for any day is obtained by removing the linear\ntrend over a time window of 15 days (\u00b17 days). Compared\nwith other detrending methods, this approach should intro-\nduce as few spurious high-frequency fluctuations as possible.\nA stratospheric disturbance has a duration of typically \u223c10\ndays. The use of a window of 15 days minimizes the effect\nof seasonal variability with the disturbances little changed.\nIt has been reported that the response in the summer hemi-\nsphere could be traced into the winter hemisphere with a\ntime lag (Becker and Fritts, 2006; Karlsson et al., 2007).\nHence in this case we have to consider the effect of the time\nlag on the correlation with the detrended temperature se-\nquences. So lagged-correlations have been calculated at each\nlatitude\/height for the detrended sequences. Figure 12 shows\nthe strongest lagged-correlation coefficient over time-lags of\n0 to 10 days (the Antarctic summer mesopause is the refer-\nence point; positive lags mean that the Antarctic mesopause\ntemperature sequence is lagging) at each latitude\/height. In\naddition, a 9-point 2-D smoothing algorithm was applied to\nthe contour plots to highlight their main features. The cor-\nresponding time lags are labeled with black numbers (unit:\nday) in the plots. Only regions with clear time lags are shown\nfor clarity. The reasons for why a range of 0 to 10 days are\nchosen are as follows. First, it is usually believed that the\nwinter hemisphere drives the summer mesopause due to the\nvariability in time and space of the winter polar vortex. That\nis to say, the time lag usually should be \u22650. Second, a strato-\nspheric disturbance has a duration of typically \u223c10 days, so\nthe lagged-correlation often also has a periodic fluctuation as\na function of the time lag. If we use a lag longer than 10\ndays, we would not separate the effect of the time lag from\nthat due to the oscillation of the sequence.\nIt is shown in Fig. 12 that the temporal variability, at\ntime scales of less than 15 days, of zonal mean tempera-\nture at the Antarctic summer mesopause is again positively\n(negatively) correlated with in the Arctic winter stratosphere\n(mesosphere) during 2004\/2005, 2005\/2006 and 2007\/2008\nwinters. That is to say, in these three winters when the po-\nlar winter stratosphere experiences a disturbance\/warming\n(SSW), the local polar mesosphere gets cooler for the same\ntime scale and the other polar mesosphere experiences a\nwarming event. This is consistent with the interhemispheric\ncoupling chain proposed by Becker and Schmitz (2003),\nBecker et al. (2004) and Becker and Fritts (2006), although\nhere we are now referring only to temporal disturbances of\nperiod less than 15 days. The 2006\/2007 winter, however,\nis largely different from other winters. The negative (posi-\ntive) correlations are mainly found in the winter stratosphere\n(mesosphere) over the middle-high northern latitudes during\nwinter 2006\/2007. As mentioned in Sect. 3.3 and shown in\nFig. 4, between disturbances the polar vortex recovered in the\nwinter hemisphere, and zonal asymmetry was restored. The\nrapid alternation between strong asymmetric and symmetric\nstructures might lead to the difference in correlation (Figs. 11\nand 12) between the 2006\/2007 winter and other winters.\nIn the plots of Fig. 12, the black numbers represent the\ntime-lags of the temperature sequences at the Antarctic sum-\nmer mesopause (the reference point) relative to the sequences\nat latitudes\/heights around the numbers when the strongest\nlagged-correlations are found over lags ranging from 0 to 10\ndays. It can be seen that the Antarctic summer mesopause-\nresponse and the onset of the Arctic winter stratospheric\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 3387\u20133409, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/\nX.

This is also the only year of our study during which\na major SSW did not occur (Sect. 3.1). During 2005\/2006\nand 2007\/2008 winters, the summer mesopause shows re-\nsponse to the winter stratospheric disturbance with a time\nlag of about a week. Both of these two winters experienced a\nMMW, continuous and numerous disturbances, and consec-\nutive and cumulative reversals of stratospheric zonal wind\nfrom westerly to easterly (Sects. 3.2 and 3.4). For winter\n2006\/2007, the interhemispheric time lag is not clear as ex-\npected from earlier discussion. The time difference between\nthe response of the Antarctic summer mesopause and the\nArctic winter stratospheric disturbance reflects the time scale\nfor interhemispheric coupling, which is probably related to\nthe characteristics of the winter polar vortex for a given year.\nIn Fig. 12, the black numbers in the Arctic upper mesosphere\nare usually slightly larger than those in the Arctic strato-\nsphere, indicating that the upper mesosphere-responses in the\nlocal NH winter are slightly leading the changes in the vor-\ntex structure at stratospheric heights. This is consistent with\nthe report that the cooling in the winter upper mesosphere\noften occurs 1\u20132 days earlier than the winter stratospheric\nwarming (Sect. 3.5). The time-lags obtained for 2004\/2005\nand 2006\/2007 are distinct from 2005\/2006 and 2007\/2008\nwhere a 6-day lag dominates for the coupling between the\nwinter stratosphere and the summer mesopause. Analysis\nusing a 6-day lag in 2004\/2005 and 2006\/2007 (not shown\nhere) indicates that the magnitude of the correlation between\nthe winter stratosphere and the summer mesopause decreases\nand even becomes the opposite sign compared to the results\nshown. This reflects the variable speed of the mesospheric\nmeridional wind and the variable characteristics of each win-\nter polar vortex.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/ Ann.

The dashed line indicates a 95% confidence level. Time lags are applied based upon the results from Fig. 12.\nSee text for details.\nNote that the values of (Pearson) correlation coefficient\nshown in Fig. 12 are a measure of a linear relationship in-\ntegrated over all frequencies. The significance test using\nthe Monte-Carlo method generally indicates that the corre-\nlation shown between summer mesopause and winter strato-\nsphere reaches a 95% significance level. To further as-\nsess the \u201creality\u201d of the relationship, first we inspected the\nsampling distributions and spectra of the detrended (short-\nterm variation) sequences of zonal mean temperatures at the\nAntarctic summer mesopause and in the Arctic winter strato-\nsphere(not shown here). The two sequences for each win-\nter are approximately in a normal distribution, which meets\nthe fundamental condition for the Pearson correlation cal-\nculations. In 2005\/2006 and 2007\/2008, the spectra of the\ntwo sequences are dominated by variations of \u223c10 day pe-\nriod, while in the other two winters the dominant periods are\nlonger. Then we performed cross-spectral analyses, which\ncan add information on frequencies relevant to a correla-\ntion. Figure 13 provides the coherence and phase between\nthe detrended sequences of zonal mean temperatures at the\nAntarctic mesopause (80\u201385\u25e6 S, 0.002 hPa) and in the Arctic\nwinter stratosphere (>65\u25e6 N, 21\u20134.6 hPa) for the four winter\nintervals used in Fig. 12. Time-lags of 0, 6, 2 and 6 days\n(derived from Fig. 12) were respectively applied in the four\nwinters so that the spectral information of strongest lagged-\ncorrelation can be examined. These spectral estimates were\nobtained by direct Fourier transform (Emery and Thomson,\n2001). Block-averaging has been used to improve the statisti-\ncal reliability of these spectral estimates and introduce spec-\ntral noise for the coherence calculation. The sequences were\npartitioned into 5 or 9 segments (depending on the length\nof sequence) with 50% overlap between adjacent segments.\nEach segment was tapered with a Hanning window. Spec-\ntra were then calculated for each segment at each frequency\nband, and then are block-averaged to form the final spec-\ntral estimates. Given a particular frequency, two signals are\nconsidered highly coherent if the coherence is large and the\nphase is close to 0\u25e6 (positive correlation) or \u00b1180\u25e6 (negative\ncorrelation). Inspection of Fig. 13 indicates the following:\nin 2005\/2006 and 2007\/2008 (right of Fig. 13), the correla-\ntion of short-term variation is dominated by fluctuations at a\nperiod of 10\u201315 days that matches the duration of a major\nSSW (Fig. 2b and Fig. 6b); in the other two winters (left of\nFig. 13) the dominant periods are longer, which corresponds\nto a weaker SSW (2004\/2005, Fig. 1b) or a recovery of strong\nvortex between SSWs (2006\/2007, Fig. 3b). The spectral\nanalyses are consistent with the features of winter polar vor-\ntex described in the last section, suggesting that the correla-\ntions along with the determined time-lags shown in Fig. 12\nare statistically reasonable.\nAnn.

The white line indicates the 95% level of\nsignificance. Time lags are applied based upon the results from Fig. 12. See text for details.\n4.4 Longitudinal variability\nThe aforementioned correlations are based on the temporal\nvariability of zonal mean temperature. However, we know\nthe temperatures in the winter hemisphere have longitudi-\nnal dependence. In particular, the zonal asymmetry of tem-\nperature over the winter mid-high latitudes is most obvious\nduring the disturbed days (e.g. Figs. 5 and 8). Compared to\nprevious correlations with zonal mean temperatures, the cor-\nrelation with temperatures in different longitudinal sectors\nin the NH might give more details of the interhemispheric\nconnection. Figure 14 shows the correlation between zonal\nmean temperature at the Antarctic summer mesopause and\ntemperature over 60\u201365\u25e6 N at each longitude sector and pres-\nsure level. The SH zonal mean temperature was used be-\ncause the longitudinal variations were very small in the local\nsummers. As for Fig. 12, time sequences of temperatures\nwere detrended before calculating correlations for Fig. 14.\nTo keep consistent with Fig. 12, the time lags of 0, 6, 2,\nand 6 days between the summer mesopause and the winter\nstratosphere-lower mesosphere (\u223c16\u201380 km), and of 1, 8, 3,\nand 8 days between the summer mesopause and the winter\nupper mesosphere (\u223c80\u201397 km) were respectively applied to\nthe correlations for the 2004\/2005, 2005\/2006, 2006\/2007,\nand 2007\/2008 winters in Fig. 14. These lags were chosen\nbased on the results of Fig. 12. On the whole, the correlations\nshow opposite signs for Scandinavia-Eastern Europe and the\nPacific-Western Canada longitudinal quadrants in these four\nwinters (Fig. 14). This is an indicative of temperature asym-\nmetries. As described in Sect. 3 and shown in the vortices\nof Figs. 4 and 7, Scandinavia-Eastern Europe (the Pacific\nWestern-Canada) is usually occupied by the polar vortex or\ncyclone (anti-cyclone) near the disturbance dates.\nIn winter 2004\/2005, the longitude sector dominated by\npositive (negative) correlations in the stratosphere (meso-\nsphere) is only slightly larger than that with negative\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3387\u20133409, 2009\n3404 X. Xu et al.: Vertical and interhemispheric links in the stratosphere-mesosphere\n(positive) in the stratosphere (mesosphere). This year did not\nexperience a major SSW, meaning that the zonal asymme-\ntries were not as large as during the other years. So the corre-\nlations using zonal mean temperatures show very weak pos-\nitive (negative) values in the stratosphere (mesosphere) over\n60\u201365\u25e6 N (upper left panel of Fig. 12). During the 2005\/2006\nand 2007\/2008 winters, stratospheric (mesospheric) positive\n(negative) correlations appeared at most of mid-latitude lon-\ngitudes, leading to the associated strong and spatially clear\npositive (negative) correlations with zonal mean temperature\nin the stratosphere (mesosphere) (right column of Fig. 12). In\ncontrast, negative (positive) correlations in the stratosphere\n(mesosphere) occupied the majority of mid-latitude longi-\ntudes in the 2006\/2007 winter. Correspondingly, the nega-\ntive (positive) correlations at the stratosphere (mesosphere)\nare found for the correlations using the zonal mean temper-\nature (lower left panel of Fig. 12). All these indicate a sta-\ntistical consistency between the correlations for the height\nversus latitude plots using zonal mean temperatures (Fig. 12)\nand for the height versus longitude plots using temperatures\nin different longitudinal sectors (Fig. 14). This analysis also\nillustrates the inadequacies associated with the use of zonal\nmean data when dealing with time intervals and winters for\nwhich the vortex was significantly distorted and\/or displaced\nfrom the pole.\nAsymmetry of the polar vortex, which led to longitu-\ndinally alternating maxima and minima in middle atmo-\nspheric temperatures (Figs. 5 and 8), and varying positive\nand negative correlations in the stratosphere and mesosphere\nat northern latitudes (>50\u25e6 N, Fig. 14), also will have led to\nstrong variations in the distribution of chemical constituents:\nozone, chlorine monoxide, nitrous oxide and hydrochloric\nacid. A prime source for these and other chemicals involved\nin the loss of ozone due to heterogeneous chemistry is the\ndata archive of Aura-MLS. Using that for winter 2004\/2005,\nManson et al. (2008) showed strong variations in these chem-\nicals within the Aleutian anticyclone and the Scandinavian-\nWestern Europe sector, which latter preferentially remains\nwithin the distorted polar vortex. Also for that winter, and\nwithin the vortex, temperatures required for Polar Strato-\nspheric Clouds (PSC) and ozone loss were shown to occur\npreferentially within the regions of cyclonic curvatures and\nnot in the anticyclonic regions of the vortex.\nWe have assessed the chemical and thermal conditions\non days near the SSW\/disturbances of 3 and 23 February\n2007, using Aura-MLS data. For heights near 500 K (orange\nto red) and relative to the areas inside the vortex (Fig. 4),\nthe mixing ratios for O3 were hemispherically low, espe-\ncially in the coldest locations (T<196 K) where ClO had\nmaximum values. The height-latitude ozone contours on 3\u2013\n5 February for longitude sectors passing through the vor-\ntex (90\u25e6\u00b112.5\u25e6 E) and the anticyclone (190\u25e6\u00b112.5\u25e6 E) are\nshown in Fig. 15. The zonal means are subtracted in this\nfigure to better distinguish the chemical conditions in the cy-\nclone and the anticyclone. There are anomalously low O3\nmixing ratios in the vortex and near 20 km (500 K). Max-\nimum ClO values are collocated, and a \u201c\u00d7\u201d symbol has\nbeen placed in that area of the 3 February 2007 vortex\n(Fig. 4). Ozone mixing ratios are high in the anticyclone\nsector, due to the presence of ozone-rich air from middle-\nlow latitudes. Notably, ozone minima and the presence of\nessential heterogeneous chemicals, continue to exist during\nSSW\/disturbances, as at these particular times the vortex is\nmost distorted and strongly cyclonic regions favoring very\nlow temperature prosper. The SSW\/disturbances of winter\n2007\/2008 are summarized chemically by reference to the\nvortices in Fig. 7 and related discussion of Sect. 3.4. As\nnoted there, a quasi-elliptical vortex existed until the ma-\njor SSW (\u223c23 February), with major axis lying through 90\u2013\n120\u25e6 E and 270\u2013290\u25e6 E. We have chosen the 9 February dis-\nturbance, which was included in the longitudinal correlations\nof Fig. 14, as being behaviorally typical of the pre-MMW in-\nterval. The height-latitude ozone contours on 9 February for\nlongitude sectors passing through the vortex (290\u25e6\u00b112.5\u25e6 E)\nand therefore close to Eureka (Canada), plus through the Pa-\ncific anticyclone (210\u25e6\u00b112.5\u25e6 E) are also shown in Fig. 15:\nagain, there are anomalously low O3 mixing ratios in the vor-\ntex and near 20 km (500 K). Maximum ClO values are also\ncollocated, and a \u201c\u00d7\u201d symbol has been placed in that area of\nthe 9 February 2008 vortex (Fig. 7). In this year temperatures\nfavouring PSC did not occur during the MMW, as the lower\nstratosphere of the polar vortex had become too large (Fig. 7)\nand relatively warm.\nThe longitudinal asymmetry of the distribution of ozone-\nchemicals during the quiet and disturbed intervals of\n2006\/2007 and 2007\/2008, including thermal and vortical\nchanges, is a powerful indicator of the importance of the vor-\ntex in hemispheric and global studies. Further consideration\nof the coupling processes between the vortex and the asso-\nciated Aleutian anti-cyclone are warranted. Given that the\nvertical motions in the mesosphere within and above these\nsystems are respectively normally downward and upward, si-\nmultaneous coupling between them and the Antarctic sum-\nmer mesosphere are inevitable and inherent in the correla-\ntions of Fig. 14. The result will be longitudinal variability\nof meridional winds, having continental and vortex-scales,\nwhich flow from Antarctica into the winter Northern Hemi-\nsphere.\n5 Summary and discussion\nBased on temperature measurements with near global view\nby Aura-MLS and supplemented by the UKMO stratospheric\nassimilated data as well as the MF radar wind observa-\ntions, we address the vertical and interhemispheric linkages\nin the stratosphere-mesosphere during four northern winters\n2004\/2005\u20132007\/2008.\nA clear vertical coupling process can be seen, even by us-\ning zonal means for the temperature sequences, during winter\nAnn.

The vertical coupling process is as follows: An in-\ncreased (decreased) planetary wave activity from the tropo-\nsphere drives increased (decreased) temperatures and a rever-\nsal or weakening (strengthening) of eastward zonal flow in\nthe polar winter stratosphere. Accordingly, the polar winter\nmesosphere shows a clear response with a cooling (warming)\nas well as a reversed or weaker (stronger) northward wind.\nThe cooling in the upper-mesosphere often slightly precedes\nthe beginning of the warming in the stratosphere. These ver-\ntical connections agree well with previous studies by others\n(e.g. Jacobi et al., 1997, 2003; Walterscheid et al., 2000;\nHoffmann et al., 2002; Dowdy et al., 2007), but are more\ncompletely (multiple years; more parameters; and higher ver-\ntical resolution) revealed by the larger observational dataset\nin this study.\nThe characterization of the vortex for each year was com-\npleted to provide perspective for the analyses later within\nthe paper. The vortices shown and discussed demonstrated\nstrong and variable distortion and displacement, usually into\nthe Scandinavian-Russian sector, which were most extreme\nduring temperature disturbances (SSW or regional warm-\nings). There were 3\u20134 disturbances each winter, and the\nthree last winters (2005\/2006\u20132007\/2008) experienced ma-\njor SSW. The Aleutian stratospheric anticyclone was always\nin evidence in the middle to upper stratosphere and was\nstrongest during the SSW. Major and minor SSWs are seen\nto be distinguished purely by the relative spatial sizes and\nintensities of the vortex and the anticyclone, so that dis-\ntinctions between the two categories are sometimes tenuous.\nWe used temperature contours plotted with height-latitude\naxes, and passing through a disturbed vortex and the asso-\nciated anticyclone to reveal the expected, but extraordinar-\nily large anti-correlations between stratospheric\/mesospheric\ntemperature perturbations. For the examples of 2006\/2007\nand 2007\/2008, and in the anticyclone, the entire strato-\nsphere was warmer than the vortex (typically +24 K), and the\nmesosphere was colder (typically\u221224 K). Given that vertical\nmotions within the vortex and the anticyclone are opposite\n(downward and upward), and that zonal means are mainly\nused for interhemispheric coupling studies, it is clear that\ngreat caution has to be used in interpreting such results.\nThe interhemispheric coupling has been identified initially\nby correlating the daily (3-day mean, centered on the mid-\ndle day) zonal mean temperature near the polar SH sum-\nmer mesopause with that at each latitude and height of the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere. From the original time sequences of\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3387\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3387\u20133409, 2009\n3406 X. Xu et al.: Vertical and interhemispheric links in the stratosphere-mesosphere\ntemperature, a positive correlation is generally found be-\ntween the polar SH summer mesopause and the polar NH\nwinter lower and middle stratosphere (\u223c16\u201340 km) during\nfour winters, 2004\/2005\u20132007\/2008. These correlations are\ndominated by the low frequency variability (i.e. the trend)\nover the 40\u201370 day sequences. The length and dates of these\nsequences were ascertained by assessments of zonal-mean\nparameters, characterizations of the winter polar vortex us-\ning vortex-edges, and associated longitudinal temperature-\nvariations.\nWith the detrended sequences, which retain periods less\nthan 15 days, the strongest value of correlation coefficient\nfor time lags of 0 to 10 days (the summer mesopause is lag-\nging) indicates that the Antarctic summer mesopause is pos-\nitively (negatively) correlated with the Arctic winter strato-\nsphere (mesosphere) during three out of the four winters.\nThe remaining winter (2006\/2007) has more complex cor-\nrelations structures; correspondingly the polar vortex was\ndistinguished this year by variations between longitudinal\nquasi-symmetry and strong asymmetry when the vortex was\ndistorted and centered over western Russia. The use of zonal\nmeans for the correlation time-sequences in this case appears\nto be unjustified; indeed we consider it problematic in any\nwinter study, without considerable investigation.\nDue to this significant departure from longitudinal tem-\nperature symmetry, associated with dynamical-thermal vor-\ntex structures, interhemispheric correlations were also com-\npleted and provided using longitudinal sectors. For\nnorthern mid-high latitudes (\u223c50\u201370\u25e6 N), temperatures in\nScandinavia-Eastern Europe and in the Pacific-Western\nCanada longitudinal sectors often have opposite signs of cor-\nrelations with zonal mean temperatures near the SH sum-\nmer mesopause during mid-winters. These longitudinal dif-\nferences in the correlation are related to the relative posi-\ntions of the cyclone (vortex) and the anticyclone. In addi-\ntion, this study also observed a positive correlation between\nthe Antarctic polar summer mesopause region and the Arc-\ntic winter stratosphere from the year-to-year variability of\nmonthly averaged zonal mean temperature in December and\nJanuary, with the greatest clarity in the early winter. This\nextends the study of Karlsson et al. (2007) to 1 other year\nand early and late winter months. The changing clarity with\ntime is considered associated with the greater distortion and\ndisplacement of the vortex, and the competing physical pro-\ncesses within the vortex and the Aleutian anticyclone.\nInspection of global temperature-correlation figures indi-\ncates variations from winter to winter. These are considered\nto be associated with the evolution of the winter polar vortex.\nThe correlations in winters 2005\/2006 and 2007\/2008 were\nvery similar, which is perhaps due to congruities in their win-\nter stratospheres such as the occurrence of a MMW, continu-\nous and numerous disturbances, and consecutive and cumu-\nlative reversals of zonal mean zonal wind from westerly to\neasterly. In the winter stratosphere of 2006\/2007, between\nwell temporally spaced disturbances there were strong vor-\ntex recoveries and movements of the vortex back toward the\npole. The alternation between strong asymmetric and sym-\nmetric structures, along with the use of zonal means for two\nof the three correlation plots shown, might well have led to\nthe differences in the correlations between the 2006\/2007\nwinter and other winters. Indeed the correlations between\nAntarctic mesospheric temperatures and the NH high mid-\nlatitudes, with longitude as the variable, show very organized\nstructures that are different from any of the other three win-\nters.\nThe correlation results also vary depending on the time in-\nterval used. In this paper the correlations are calculated over\nintervals covering most of the stratospheric disturbances in\nrespective winters because what we are most interested in are\nSH summer mesospheric manifestations of NH winter distur-\nbances. It is known that the temporal evolution of tempera-\nture includes not only transient variations but also seasonal\nvariability. The transient variations with periods of several\ndays (\u223c5, 10 and 16 days) are induced by planetary scale\nresonances or Rossby Waves, while the seasonal variability\nis attributed to a complex combination of insolation, dynam-\nics and chemistry. A detailed statistical analysis of the sea-\nsonality in global temperature would require many years of\ndata for stable estimates, and cannot be performed in this pa-\nper. The use of the detrending method as applied in this paper\nwill have significantly reduced the influence of the seasonal\nvariability on correlations for each winter (see Sect. 4).\nAnother important factor influencing the features of the\nglobal (height versus latitude) correlations for the high fre-\nquency variability (periods less than 15 days) is the time-lag\nbetween the reference position and each latitude\/height. We\nassociate these time-lags with the time-scales for interhemi-\nspheric coupling in each winter. Since we do not know the\ntime-scales, the correlation and time-lag are determined by\nlooking for the largest magnitude of correlation coefficient\nwithin a range of time-lags (e.g. Becker and Fritts, 2006). In\nthis paper time lags ranging from 0 to 10 days are considered\nin the correlation analyses with high frequency variability.\nOur principle reason for this choice is that stratospheric dis-\nturbances in our four winter study have durations of typically\n\u223c10 days. The differences in correlation-patterns between\nthe four winters might be related to this limited range of time\nlags, but our analyses are most consistent and physically re-\nalistic with the lag-range of 0\u201310 days.\nIn spite of the differences from winter to winter, this work\ngenerally suggests the following chain: the propagation of\nPW disturbances from the NH winter troposphere produces\na warmer winter stratosphere, a cooler winter mesosphere,\nand then a warmer SH summer mesopause. Such a chain is\nconsistent with other studies (e.g. Becker and Schmitz, 2003,\nBecker et al., 2004; Becker and Fritts, 2006; Karlsson et al.,\n2007), although this paper is the first to overtly distinguish\nlow and high frequency processes in correlation studies, or\nin other words seasonal trends and the shorter time-scale dis-\nturbances.

Warming occurs when the heat transport is larger than\nthe adiabatic cooling caused by wave-forced vertical motion.\nDue to wave-forced vertical motion from below (e.g. Wal-\nterscheid et al., 2000) and the modulated gravity wave drag\nin the mesosphere (e.g. Becker and Fritts, 2006), the north-\nward meridional wind into the Arctic mesosphere will be\nweakened or reversed when a stratospheric warming occurs,\nleading to a cooler winter mesosphere. The associated down-\nwelling at high polar latitudes will be weaker or in the case of\na reversed meridional flow, an upwelling will occur. This in-\nterpretation is supported by the in-phase relation near the dis-\nturbance dates of 2004\/2005\u20132007\/2008 between the merid-\nional wind and zonal mean temperature in the NH polar\nmesosphere, as shown in Sect. 3.\nBased on Becker and Fritts (2006), the meridional cir-\nculation anomaly can go across the equator and continue\nin the SH summer hemisphere, causing a warmer summer\nmesopause by a weaker upwelling or a down-welling. The\nobserved global meridional flows near 95 km for the two\nsolstices (June\u2013July 1993, December\u2013January 1993\/2004;\nManson et al., 2002) demonstrate this along with some\nsmaller scale longitudinal variability of the meridional flows.\nSuch flows are strongly inferred by the global atmospheric\ncorrelations that have been the focus of this paper. Currently\nwe cannot directly demonstrate this across-equator propaga-\ntion, by the use of observations for the years of this study,\ndue to lack of sufficient meridional wind data near the equa-\ntor and at the southern high latitudes. Here we show only one\nexample. Figure 16 gives meridional winds at 88 km over\nSaskatoon (52\u25e6 N, 253\u25e6 E) (dashed line) compared with those\nover Rothera (68\u25e6 S, 292\u25e6 E) (solid line) for the 2004\/2005\nwinter. During the Pacific-Western Canada warming near\nthe end of February and the final warming in mid-March,\nthe meridional winds over Rothera and Saskatoon are nearly\nin phase. This may be an example of the mesospheric merid-\nional wind flowing southward across the equator in the pres-\nence of enhanced SPW activity and a distorted polar vortex\nin the NH winter stratosphere. Detailed interhemispheric dy-\nnamics will be explored in the future after additional merid-\nional wind observations become available.\nAcknowledgements.
