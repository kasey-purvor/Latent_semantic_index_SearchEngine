Two frequency Planar Doppler Velocimetry (2\uf06e-PDV) is used in conjunction with imaging \nfibre bundles to make time-averaged three component velocity measurements using a single CCD \ncamera and iodine cell.

These images are then used to produce a normalised transmission image that can be processed \nas in normal PDV. Three component measurements are made possible by porting separate views to a \nsingle CCD camera using the imaging fibre bundles.

Planar Doppler Velocimetry, flow measurement, acousto-optic frequency switching, \ncoherent fibre bundles \n \n1 Introduction \n \nThe non-intrusive measurement of flow using laser methods has proven to be invaluable as a diagnostic tool \nfor many years both for the designer and also for those interested in fundamental investigations of fluid \nmechanics. Original optical systems, laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) and laser transit anemometry (LTA), \nmeasure velocities at a point within the flow with high temporal resolution. However, the time taken to map \nflow fields, for example in large wind tunnel facilities, is very costly and often precludes their use. In \naddition there is increasing interest in techniques able to provide information simultaneously from different \nregions of the flow thus enabling spatial features of the flow to be measured. The development of planar \ntechniques has helped to address this issue. In planar flow measurement a region of the flow is illuminated \nwith a laser beam conditioned to form a light sheet in the region of interest. The light scattered from particles \nentrained in the flow is imaged onto two-dimensional detector arrays, usually CCDs. \n \nThe most developed planar flow measurement method is particle image velocimetry (PIV) in which two \nimages of the flow are collected with a short time difference between them [1]. Correlation techniques are \nthen used to calculate the distance and direction a particle has moved. A single viewing direction and laser \nsheet results in the measurement of two velocity components in the plane of the sheet. The out of plane \nvelocity component is more difficult to extract but techniques based on stereoscopic viewing have shown \nsome success. PIV requires a well-controlled seeding density and particle size and is limited to reasonably \nsmall flow field sizes.  \n \nIn contrast the more recent technique of Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV)[2-5], also know as Doppler \nGlobal Velocimetry (DGV), is capable of operating with a range of seeding densities, large flow fields and \nhigh speed flows (>100m\/s). Three components of velocity can be measured instantaneously or time-\naveraged depending on the laser source and image processing methods used. PDV was originally \nimplemented using conventional optical components, but more recently the addition of optical fibres to the \ninstrumentation has added considerable flexibility and functionality to the technique[6-11]. \n \nPDV relies upon measuring the Doppler frequency shift of light scattered from particles entrained in the \nflow. The technique allows the measurement of the three-dimensional flow velocities over many points in \nthe plane, quickly and non-intrusively. \n \nA single observation direction can measure a single component of velocity, as shown in figure 1, and \nmultiple viewing, or illumination, directions are required for multiple velocity component measurements. \nThis would usually require multiple imaging systems, however the use of imaging fibre bundles[9] allows \nseveral observation directions, and thus velocity components, to be measured simultaneously by spatially \nmultiplexing on to a single CCD camera.  \n \nThe optical frequency shift, v\uf044 , is given by the Doppler equation:  \nc\nV)iov(\nv\n\uf0d7\uf02d\n\uf03d\uf044\n\u02c6\u02c6\n \n(1) \nwhere v is the optical frequency, o\u02c6 and i\u02c6 are unit vectors in the observation and illumination directions \nrespectively, V is the velocity vector and c is the free space speed of light.  \n \nFigure 1. The relationship of laser illumination direction and observation direction to the measured velocity component determined \nfrom the Doppler equation.  \n \nThe optical frequency of light scattered from each particle in the seeded flow experiences a Doppler shift, \nwhich is linearly related to the velocity of the particle. In PDV, a region of the illuminated flow is imaged, \nthrough a glass cell usually containing iodine vapour, onto the active area of a CCD camera. Iodine has \nnumerous narrow absorption lines over a large part of the visible spectrum[12] and the laser frequency is \nchosen to coincide with one such line. Hence the optical intensity at any position in the camera image is a \nfunction of the Doppler shift experienced at the corresponding position in the flow, via the frequency-\ndependent iodine absorption. \n \nThe intensity over a PDV image is also affected by the intensity profile of the illuminating laser sheet \n(typically Gaussian), spatial variations of the seeding density within the flow, and diffraction fringes caused \nby imperfections in the optical surfaces.  These variations are generally of similar amplitude to those \nresulting from absorption in the iodine cell, and can obscure the information about flow velocity that is \ncontained within the camera image. It is therefore usual to amplitude-divide the image beam onto two \ncameras, figure 2; from one of the two imaging paths the iodine cell is omitted, and the resulting image acts \nas a reference to normalize the signal image carrying the velocity information. \n \n2 Two frequency Planar Doppler Velocimetry (2\uf06e-PDV) \n \nIn the two-frequency Planar Doppler Velocimetry (2\uf06e-PDV)[10] technique the signal and reference images \nare acquired sequentially, on the same CCD camera, figure 3, by the use of two illumination frequencies. \nThere are two approaches to the positioning of the illuminations frequencies relative to the iodine absorption \nline.  \nIn the first a signal and reference image are captured similar to conventional PDV. The first illumination \nfrequency is tuned just off the low frequency side of an absorption line to lie in a 100% transmission region \nof the iodine transfer function (figure 4, point A). A reference image is then acquired. The second \nillumination frequency is positioned at approximately midway (50%) on the iodine cell transfer function \n(figure 4, point B), and a signal image is acquired. The two images can then be processed as in conventional \nPDV, by dividing the two images to produce a normalised transmission image that is then used to calculate \nthe frequency, Doppler shift and finally the velocity. \nSignal CCD and \nimaging lens\nReference CCD and\nimaging lens\nIodine Absorption\nfilter\nBeam splitter\nMirror\n \nFigure 2.

Two frequency PDV, single CCD camera, imaging head. \n \nThe second approach increases the sensitivity of the system by tuning the two frequencies to the positions \nshown as B and C in figure 4. With one source tuned onto the falling slope and the other on the rising slope, \na constant Doppler shift will result in the further attenuation of one image to a lower signal level and the rise \nin the signal level in the other image. Dividing the difference of the images by the sum, and taking into \naccount any difference in the gradients will give a result that has approximately double the sensitivity of the \ncurrent PDV methods.  \n-0.1\n0.1\n0.3\n0.5\n0.7\n0.9\n1.1\n-2 -1 0 1 2\nFrequency (GHz)\nN\no\nrm\na\nli\ns\ne\nd\n T\nra\nn\ns\nm\nis\ns\nio\nn\n\u0394\u03bd\nReference beam\nnr\n\u0394\u03bd\nSignal beam\nA A'\nB\nB'\n\u0394\u03bd\nC\nC'\n \nFigure 4. Relative positions of the laser frequency, and the shifted frequency on a typical absorption feature for 2\uf06e-PDV (A and B\/C \ndenote the position of the illumination frequencies and A' and B'\/C' the Doppler shifted frequency) \n If the initial (un-shifted) transmission of each frequency is located on the linear portion of each slope, and the \nexpected Doppler shifts will not cause the scattered frequency to fall outside of the linear region then the \nnormalisation can be performed using the following analysis. Here each slope is assumed to have a constant \ngradient. \n \nIf the flow is illuminated using two frequencies of laser light, which are tuned to opposite sides of the iodine \nabsorption line, as shown in figure 4, (points B and C), then the Doppler shift expressed in terms of the \nchange in transmission (for the first beam), \uf044T1, can be obtained. \n \nIf the intensity of the light scattered from the flow at any point is given by, Is, then this can be assumed to be \nthe same under both illuminations, if the time interval between them is short and the seeding conditions \nremain constant, as the difference in the Mie scattering for the closely spaced frequencies will be negligible. \nThere is no discernable differences in Mie scattering until the wavelength difference is ~0.5nm, here we use \na difference of ~0.001nm. \n \nThe intensity recorded at a pixel on the CCD will depend upon this scattered intensity and the absorption that \noccurs in the iodine cell, which is dependant upon the frequency of the illuminating light. \n \nUnder the illumination of the first frequency, \uf06e1, the recorded intensity, I1, will be given by: \nsImTTI )( 1111 \uf044\uf02b\uf03d  \n(2) \nSimilarly under the illumination of the second frequency, \uf06e2, the recorded intensity, I2, will be given by: \nsImTTI )( 2122 \uf044\uf02d\uf03d  \n(3) \nWhere: \nI1, I2 Recorded intensity at any pixel on the CCD under the illumination of \uf06e1 and \uf06e2 \nIs The intensity of the light scattered from any point in the flow. \nT1, T2 Initial (un-shifted) transmission ratios of the illumination frequencies, \uf06e1 and \uf06e2 \n\uf044T1 Change in transmission ratio (on the negative gradient slope of the iodine \nabsorption line.) \nM1, M2 Gradients functions of the two sides of the iodine absorption line \n1\n1\n1\n1 \uf03d\uf03d\nM\nM\nm  \nNormalised gradient of the negative gradient side of the iodine absorption line. \n1\n2\n2\nM\nM\nm \uf03d  \nNormalised gradient of positive gradient side of the iodine absorption line. \n \nBy rearranging and equating (2) and (3) the change in transmission is given by: \n)()( 11122121 mTTImTTI \uf044\uf02b\uf03d\uf044\uf02d  \n(4) \n)(\n)(\n1221\n1221\n1\nImIm\nTITI\nT\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\uf044  \n(5) \nThis shift can then be added to the initial transmission ratio, T1, of the first illumination frequency to find the \nnormalised transmission, R, as found in conventional PDV using a signal divided by a reference. \nAlternatively the Doppler frequency shift can be calculated directly from \uf044T1 using the gradient of the first \n(negative gradient) slope of the absorption line. \n11 TTR \uf044\uf02b\uf03d  \n(6) \nHowever as the gradient of each slope is not constant, a look-up table can be used to perform the \nnormalisation. The value of the ratio I1\/I2 for known values of the Doppler shift can be calculated using \ncurves fitted to each slope of the iodine absorption line. The un-shifted illumination frequencies are found \nfrom their initial transmissions, then the Doppler shift is then added to each frequency and the transmission \nat this shifted frequency can then be found. Finally the ratio T1\/T2 (= I1\/I2) for that value of the Doppler shift \nis calculated. The ratio of the measured intensities in the two images can then by used with the lookup table \nto find the Doppler shift. Using this approach the range of Doppler shifts is no longer restricted to just the \nlinear portion of the iodine absorption line, allowing a greater range of flow velocities to be measured. \n \nBoth of the normal and increased sensitivity approaches overcome several problems identified with \nconventional PDV. In conventional PDV superposition of the two images to sub-pixel accuracy is essential if \nerrors in the calculated velocities are to be minimized. For example Thorpe et al[13] assess the impact of \nimage misalignment, on the velocity field of a rotating disc, for an image misalignment of 0.1 pixels, they \ngive an estimate of this error as \u00b1 5ms\n-1\n. Errors due to poor image registration become particularly \ntroublesome if large velocity gradients are present in the region imaged. The main causes of poor image \nregistration are differences between the optical aberrations and magnifications of the two imaging paths so \nerrors tend to be worse towards the outside edges of the images, where these factors are largest. In 2\uf06e-PDV \nalignment of the reference and signal images on the active area of the camera is no longer an issue and the \nsignal\/reference image misalignment problem found in conventional PDV is avoided.  \n \nThe 2\uf06e-PDV method also eliminates the polarization sensitivity of the split ratio of the beam splitter used in \ntwo-camera systems[14]. Ideally the beam splitter used in a conventional PDV imaging head would split the \nincoming light 50:50 between the signal and reference cameras with no variation for different polarizations \nof light. However even the 'non-polarizing' beam splitters typically used retain a slight sensitivity to \npolarization, typically quoted as \u00b13% variation in the split ratio for S and P polarized light, leading to typical \nvelocity errors of \u00b17ms\n-1\n. \n \nA two-wavelength method has been described by Arnette et al [15], using two laser lines (532 and 618nm) \nand a colour CCD to capture signal and reference images simultaneously. However the effects of different \nscattering efficiencies from the particles at the two widely spaced wavelengths were not taken into account, \nnor were the differing responses of the CCD used at these different wavelengths. The arrangement of pixels \nin a colour camera would imply that there is an image offset of at least one and possible two pixels between \nthe signal and reference image, so image misalignment issues remain. Another problem was that of  \u201csignal \nbleed\u201d of the scattered intensity from one pixel to another led that led to significant errors. It is also unclear \nwhat effect the absorption bands in the region of the 618nm reference beam had on the reference signal, as \nthe iodine absorption spectrum was not reported either experimentally or theoretically at this wavelength. \n \nMuller et al [16] described a similar method using a frequency modulated Distributed Bragg Reflector \n(DBR) laser diode (852.6nm, 100mW) and a Caesium absorption cell to capture three sequential images at \nthree wavelengths for a single velocity component.  \n \n3 Multiple viewing directions using imaging fibre bundles \nViewing the flow from a single observation direction allows a single component of the flow velocity to be \nmeasured; therefore to make three-dimensional measurements a minimum of three viewing directions are \nnecessary. Conventional methods use a separate PDV imaging head (two cameras and an iodine cell each) to \nmeasure each of the three velocity components. The use of imaging fibre bundles, pioneered at Cranfield \nUniversity[9,17,18], to port multiple views of the region of interest to a single detector head, considerably \nsimplifies the system and makes it possible to make three component velocity measurements using a single \nPDV imaging head. A similar multi-branch imaging fibre bundles has been described by Willert et al [19]. \n \nThe custom made imaging fibre bundles in use at Cranfield uses a coherent array of fibres that is spilt into \nfour channels (figure 5). Each channel is 4m long, and has 600x500 fibres that are 8\uf06dm in diameter and \npositioned at 10\uf06dm centres. Cross talk between fibres is minimised by the use of interstitial absorbers \nbetween fibres[20]. The losses through the bundle are ~50% for the 4m length used. The four views are \ncombined at the detector head, with each occupying a quarter of the CCD image (figure 6). An example of \nthe image formed is shown in figure 7. This is a view of a calibration target used to de-warp the image to a \ncommon view and determine the observation directions for each view[21]. Figure 8 shows the result after \nthis de-warping process; here all four views have been overlaid for demonstration purposes.  \n \n  \nFigure 5. The individual arms of the imaging fibre bundles. Figure 6. The combined end of the imaging fibre bundles. \n \n \n \nFigure 7.

An example of the 'de-warped' views, showing all four \nviews overlaid and centred on the same point. \n \n4 Experimental Arrangement \n \n4.1 Illumination system \nIn our previous work using 2v-PDV[10] a combination of acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) were used to \nshift the optical frequency of an argon-ion laser to provide two illumination frequencies separated by \napproximately 700MHz. The light source used was a tuneable Argon-ion laser (Spectra Physics Beamlok \n2060), incorporating a temperature-stabilized etalon to ensure single-mode operation at 514.5 nm. The \nsingle-mode line width was about 2 MHz and optical frequency stability was ~10MHz jitter plus a long-term \ndrift with ambient temperature of ~50MHzK\n-1\n. This set-up allowed rapid switching between the two \nillumination frequencies. However this system proved to be light inefficient due principally to multiple \npasses through a high frequency AOM, resulting in low illumination powers. This combined with the use of \nthe imaging fibre bundles, with an optical efficiency of approximately 50%, resulted in low scattered light \nlevels being collected on the CCD. \n \nFor this work the experimental arrangement was modified to allow greater illumination power; this new \narrangement is shown in figure 9. The beam passes through an optical isolator to prevent back reflections \nentering the laser cavity; the polarisation is then adjusted using the first half wave plate to set the intensity of \nlight entering the frequency locking system. The second half wave plate is used to adjust the polarisation for \ncoupling into the high birefringent single mode polarisation maintaining fibre (York VSOP 2253-01F) used \nto guide the light to the beam scanning light sheet generator. \n \nHere the laser frequency is selected by changing the optical path length of the intra cavity etalon and is then \nstabilized using a locking system[22]. This consisted of an iodine cell, signal and reference photodiodes and \nlocking electronics which adjusts the laser etalon temperature to ensure that the laser frequency is stable, \nbased upon the transmission through this cell. The cell used in the locking system is a saturated cell, 100mm \nin length, which is held in a temperature controlled oven at 30\no\nC. It is necessary that the frequency of the \nlocking beam is shifted by 260MHz, using an acousto-optic modulator, so that the locking system can still \noperate if the laser frequency is tuned to 100% transmission. The locking beam will be shifted onto the \nabsorption line so that any frequency fluctuations will result in an associated transmission fluctuation seen by \nthe photodiodes and can then be corrected for. The addition of the locking system allowed the laser \nfrequency stability to be improved to ~3MHz.  \n \nAlthough this arrangement increased the illumination power, the images are now captured with a separation \nof minutes rather than seconds, although for time average measurements presented here this has not proved \nto be a problem. \n \nBoth beams are coupled into the optical fibre and are then delivered to a prism-scanning device[6]. This \nscans the collimated beam rapidly across the region of interest, resulting in an ideal 'top-hat\u201f intensity profile \nof the generated light sheet.  \n \nImaging\noptics\nCollection\nlens\nCCD\nCombined end\nof imaging fibre\nbundles\nIodine\nabsorption\ncell\nArgon Ion Laser\nDetector Head\nControl\/ Capture\ncomputer\nBeam scanning \nlight sheet generator\nRegion of Interest\nFrequency \nlocking system\nIodine\nabsorption cell\nPhoto-\ndiodes\nOptical fibre \nbeam delivery\nView 1\nView 2\nView 3\nView 4\nPBS\nHWP HWP\nAOM\nBS\nOptical\nisolator\n \nFigure 9.

This technique is used in conventional PDV \nto correct for differences in the optical paths for the two images. In our previous work a similar correction \nwas thought to be necessary due to the differences in the spatial profile of the two beams exiting the optical \nfibre, used to transport them to the sheet generator. These differences were accentuated when a thick sheet \nwas required; such as when illuminating the face of a disc, this resulted in the white card correction being \nnecessary for these measurements. However with the arrangement described above both frequencies have \nidentical paths so the spatial profile of both beams after the fibre will be identical avoiding the need for a \nwhite card type correction. \n \nAs well as providing increased beam powers, it is now possible to tune both illumination frequencies to \ncoincide with either side of the absorption line allowing 2\uf06e-PDV measurements to be made using the second, \nincreased sensitivity approach, described in section 2. This was not possible using the combination of AOMs \npreviously reported, as a frequency separation of greater than 700MHz is required to span the absorption \nline, and this was not achievable with the AOMs available. \n \n4.2 Image capture system. \nAs described above the image capture system is greatly simplified by the use of imaging fibre bundles and \nthe two-frequency technique, with the imaging head consisting of a single CCD camera and temperature \nstabilised iodine cell, figure 10, with the views being ported to the imaging head via the imaging fibre \nbundles. Each channel of the fibre bundles viewed the region of interest using 35mm SLR camera lenses \ncoupled to the fibre using custom mounts. The light efficiency of the optical system is approximately 50% \nthrough the imaging fibre bundles and 50% from the output of the fibre bundles to the CCD. Although the \nnumerical aperture of the imaging system is not well matched to the bundles the optics were chosen to \nproduce high quality flat field images on the CCD chip. \n \nThe camera used was an \u201eImager Intense\u201f camera supplied by LaVision. This is a digital camera with 12 bit \nA\/D conversion on a Peltier-cooled chip (-15\no\nC), with a 1376 by 1040 image resolution. The pixel size is \n6.7\uf06dm by 6.7\uf06dm. Dedicated image acquisition and processing software (DaVis) is used to control the camera \nand process and display the captured data. The integration time of the camera can be varied between 1 ms \nand 1000s, depending on the scattered light intensity. The camera dark current noise was found to be \nrelatively constant with integration time, typically 40 counts, and can be removed using a background \nsubtraction. Another important characteristic of the CCD is camera linearity. The manufacturer's \nspecification quote a non-linearity of less than 1%, this was previously investigated[10] and the camera \nfound to be linear over 90% of full range. The remaining non-linear portion can be avoided by discarding \npixel intensities over a certain threshold, typically >3800 counts. \n \nFigure 10. Photograph showing the single camera imaging head arrangement. \n \nThe iodine cell, figure 11, which operates as a starved cell[23], is 25 mm in diameter and 50 mm long, and \nincorporates a cold finger that was used to determine the starvation temperature. The use of a starved cell \nmeans that the control of the cell temperature can be less stringent, as above the starvation temperature all \nCCD camera Iodine cell and \noven \nImaging fibre bundles \n(combined end) \nCold finger \nthe iodine is in vapour form, so the characteristics of the absorption will not vary greatly with temperature. \nThe operating temperature should not be too much greater than the starvation temperature of the cell, \notherwise thermal broadening of the absorption lines will alter the cell characteristics[24]. The starvation \ntemperature of the cell used is 40\no\nC. The cold finger is held above this temperature using a Peltier element in \na feedback loop, and the cell body is contained in an oven held at the same temperature (50\no\nC). The cell \ndiameter is much smaller than those typically used in PDV (50-100mm[6,25]), due to the use of the imaging \nfibre bundles, helping to maintain a constant temperature throughout the cell volume. \n \nFigure 11.

Experimental scan of the iodine absorption cell (crosses), shown plotted over the theoretical absorption spectrum[26]. \n \nIn the first implementation of 2\uf06e-PDV, in which signal and reference images are captured, the shape of the \niodine absorption around the 100% transmission region is of interest as the reference image is captured when \nthe flow is illuminated with a frequency positioned here (figure 4, point A). As the reference image should \nbe unaffected by Doppler shifts, this region needs to be flat, at 100% transmission, over the range of \nexpected frequency shifts. Figure 12 shows an experimental scan of the iodine cell used in this work, \noverlaid on the theoretical iodine absorption, it can be seen that this region is flat over a range of ~1GHz. \n25mm \n90mm \n50mm \nCold finger \nIodine cell \nOven heater and \nfan assembly \nSlight differences exist between the modelled and measured transmission due to differences between the cell \nmodelled and that used experimentally. Impurities in the cell as well as a slight difference in the quantity of \niodine will both effect the transmission profile. In this work this is unimportant as the experimental curve \nwas used in the calculations. \n \n4.3 Data collection \/ processing scheme. \nAs the modified 2\uf06e-PDV system described above allowed sufficient frequency spacing between the two \nillumination frequencies it was possible to capture data using both the normal sensitivity and increased \nsensitivity approaches. Therefore to allow comparison between the two approaches, the data collection \nscheme consisted of capturing three images in succession under different illumination frequencies. The first \nimage was captured when the laser was tuned, and locked to a full transmission position (figure 4, point A) \nnext the laser was tuned to a point at approximately 50% transmission on the falling slope (figure 4, point B) \nand a second image captured. Finally the laser frequency was tuned to a similar position on the rising slope \n(figure 4, point C,) and the third image captured. A background image was acquired before the data capture \nand is subtracted from all images to remove ambient scattered light and CCD dark current noise. \n \nThe first two images are analogous to the reference and signal images in conventional PDV and are used to \nproduce a normalised transmission image in the normal sensitivity 2\uf06e-PDV approach. The second and third \nimage can be used in the increased sensitivity 2\uf06e-PDV approach to produce a normalised transmission image \nas described in section 2 using (2)-(6).  \n \n \nSignal Image Reference \nImage \nSplit into four \nviews \nSplit into four \nviews \nCalculate \nvelocity \ncomponent 1 \nTransform to \northogonal \ncomponents \nCalculate \nvelocity \ncomponent 2 \nCalculate \nvelocity \ncomponent 3 \nCalculate \nvelocity \ncomponent 4 \nDewarp Dewarp Dewarp Dewarp \nSig Ref Sig Ref Sig Ref Sig Ref \nView 1 View 2 View 3 View 4 \nOptional \n \nFigure 13. Flow diagram detailing the processing scheme for a 3D PDV measurement. \n \nAn overview of the processing scheme used when making 3D measurements is shown in figure 13. Before \nthe normalised transmission is calculated the image is split into the four views and each view is de-warped to \na common view. The de-warping process also calculates the observation direction for each view on a pixel-\nby-pixel basis[21]. The de-warping process requires a target to be placed in the region of interest and an \nimage captured. Software is then used to identify the markers on the target and map the image to a regular \ngrid. A threshold is also applied to the images to remove pixels whose signal levels are too low or are \nsaturated (typically signal levels of <50 counts and >3800counts).  \n \nIn conventional PDV processing it is necessary to apply a white card correction to the ratio image to obtain \nthe normalised transmission image. The need for this correction in conventional PDV has also been observed \nin our previous work, as well as by other researchers[27-29]. However this is not necessary when using the \n2\uf06e-PDV techniques due to the automatic alignment between the two images used.  \n \nMany researchers[27,28] also apply low pass filters to the data or processed results to remove high frequency \nnoise, however in this work this was found to be unnecessary and so has been avoided or kept to a minimum. \nFinally once each view has been processed to a measured velocity component it is necessary to convert from \nthese non-orthogonal components to the three orthogonal velocity components, U, V and W. \n \n5 Results \n \n5.1 Three dimensional velocity measurements on a rotating disc. \nThe system was used to measure the velocity field of a rotating disc. This provides a well-known velocity \nfield with which to characterise the performance of the system. Each arm of the imaging fibre bundle was \nused with a 35mm SLR camera lens to view the rotating disc. The disc itself was 200mm in diameter, \nalthough the common field of view of each observation direction was an approximate disc 100mm in \ndiameter. The rotation of the disc was measured using an optical tachometer giving a maximum velocity in \nthe field of view of ~\uf0b134ms-1. The geometry for the measurements is shown in figure 14, with three views \n(O1, O2 and O4) located in forward scatter and the third located in backscatter. Views 3 and 4 (O3 and O4) are \nin the XZ plane and view 1 and 2 (O1 and O2) are raised\/lowered out of the plane. \n \nFigure 14.  Diagram showing the viewing geometry used when making measurements on the rotating disc. O1, O2, O3 and O4 are \nthe observation directions for each arm of the imaging fibre bundles. \n \nMeasurements were made using both 2\uf06e-PDV approaches described above. In order to measure all three \ncomponents of velocity it is necessary to view from at least three directions, however the imaging fibre \nbundle in use has four channels so all four were used to view the face of the disc. The process of converting \nthe measured velocity components to the three orthogonal components magnifies the error present. This \nresults in the errors in the orthogonal components being greater than those in a single velocity component \nmeasurement. We have found that the use of a fourth measured velocity component can significantly reduce \nthese conversion errors. The viewing configuration used for disc measurements is also far from ideal due to \nthe restriction of only being able to view the light sheet (the face of the disc) from a single side, so this \nmagnification is greater than it would be for real seeded flow experiments where the light sheet can be \nviewed from both sides. The use of additional velocity components and the optimum positioning for the \nviewing direction will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming publication. \n  \nFigure 15. A single measured velocity component of a \nrotating disc, calculated using the normal sensitivity \nscheme. \nFigure 16. A single measured velocity component of a \nrotating disc, calculated using the increased sensitivity \nscheme. \n \nEach observation direction was processed to yield the measured velocity component given by (\u00f4 \u2013 \u00ee) for both \nthe normal and increased sensitivity 2\uf06e-PDV schemes. As discussed above, both illumination frequencies \nbeams have identical paths which results in identical signal and reference illumination profiles and there \nbeing no need to apply the 'white card' correction to realise the velocity field. The low-pass filtering \ncommonly used in PDV processing was kept to a minimum, with no filtering at all applied to these results. \n \nFigure 15 and figure 16 show examples of a single measured velocity component for both sensitivity \nschemes. Here it can be seen that the velocity component captured using the increased sensitivity scheme is \nvisibly less noisy than that captured using the normal sensitivity scheme. \n \nIn order to assess the benefit of the increased sensitivity scheme, a theoretical velocity component was \ngenerated, for all points on the wheel, for each view. At each point this was subtracted from the calculated \ncomponent and a histogram of this variation over the image plotted. Figure 17 shows the resulting \nhistograms for a single velocity component for both normal and increased sensitivity schemes. Here it can be \nseen that the resulting error is smaller for the increased sensitivity scheme. \n Figure 17. Histograms showing the difference between the measured and theoretical velocity component.  \n+ Normal sensitivity 2\uf06e-PDV technique, * Increased sensitivity 2\uf06e-PDV technique.  \n \nSimilar plots were produced for all four velocity components and the standard deviations for these are shown \nin table 1. It can be seen that there is approximately a 40% reduction in the level of error when using the \nincreased sensitivity scheme over the normal sensitivity scheme. \n \nTable 1.

Figure 18 shows a comparison between \nthe two sensitivity schemes for these orthogonal velocity components. The improved sensitivity can also be \nseen in these calculated orthogonal components with the increased sensitivity results being visibly smoother. \nAgain if these calculated orthogonal components are compared with the theoretical orthogonal velocity \ncomponents and histograms taken of this variation, the increased sensitivity scheme makes a considerable \nimprovement. The standard deviations of this, shown in table 2, are again typically 40% smaller for the \nincreased sensitivity scheme compared with the normal sensitivity scheme, as would be expected from the \nimprovement in the measured velocity components \n \n \n  \n \nU (normal sensitivity) U (increased sensitivity) U error \n  \n \nV (normal sensitivity) V (increased sensitivity) V error \n  \n \nW (normal sensitivity) W (increased sensitivity) W error \nFigure 18.

The jet \nhas a theoretical exit velocity of 94ms\n-1\n, which was calculated by measuring the nozzle pressure ratio. \nImages where captured with an integration time of 10 seconds. \n \nThe system was set-up as shown in figure 19, with three views positioned on one side of the sheet and the \nfourth viewing from the opposite side. As mentioned above the ability to position views on opposite sides of \nthe light sheet greatly improves the propagation of errors from the measured velocity components to the \northogonal velocity components. An example of a measurement is shown in figure 20, with vectors showing \nthe in-plane velocities and the colour representing the out-of-plane component.  \n \n \nFigure 19. 3D schematic diagram showing the experimental configuration used for measurements on the seeded air jet. \n \nAs the jet was seeded through the air intake, seeding levels outside of the jet were low resulting in low levels \nof scattered light for these regions. As any velocity measurements for these regions would be unreliable a \nthreshold has been applied to the data. As with the disc measurements four viewing directions, and hence \nfour velocity components, were used in the calculation of the orthogonal velocity components to minimise \nthe final errors. Similarly no 'white-card' correction was necessary and low pass filtering was minimal, a \nsingle pass of a 3x3 averaging filter in order to smooth the vectors. It can be seen that the measurements \nshow the expected development of the jet, in the main flow direction, with minimal out-of-plane velocities. \n \n2\u03bd-PDV imaging head \nTo \nlaser \nHi-Bi optical \nfibre \nLight sheet generator Jet nozzle \nLaser light \nsheet \nSLR lens \nCombined end of \nimaging fibre bundles Imaging optics \nIodine cell \nCCD \n  \nFigure 20. Example of a 3D 2\uf06e-PDV measurement made on a seeded air jet. Vectors show the in plane velocities (every 8th and 40th \nvector show in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively) and colour the out of plane velocity. \n \nA second set of measurements were then made with the jet nozzle rotated, so that the main flow was in the \nout-of-plane direction. A 'swirler' was introduced into the nozzle, in an attempt to create more in-plane flow \nvelocities. The nozzle was positioned at various distances from the sheet allowing the measurement of the \nflow velocities in several slices through the jet; this is shown in figure 21. A single slice, at 120mm \ndownstream from the nozzle, is shown in figure 22. In these measurements the vectors represent the in-plane \nvelocity components and the colour represents the out-of-plane velocity component. Again seeding was \nintroduced to the jet via the air intake, so signal levels in regions outside of the jet were low so measurements \nin these regions have been removed using a threshold. It can be seen, in figure 22, that the jet was swirling \nand drawing in air predominantly from one side of the flow, this could also been seen visually in the light \nsheet. \n \n6 Discussion and Conclusions \n \nA PDV technique using two illumination frequencies and imaging fibre bundles has been demonstrated that \nis capable of measuring all three components of velocity, across a plane defined by a light sheet, using a \nsingle CCD camera. As an extension of our previous work, where single component, time averaged, velocity \nmeasurements were made, the system was expanded to measure all three components of velocity using \nimaging fibre bundles. The system was demonstrated with 3D velocity measurements on a rotating disc and a \nseeded air jet.  \n \n \nFigure 21. 3D 2\uf06e-PDV cross section measurements on a seeded air jet. Vectors represent the in plane velocities (every 12th x 12th vector \nshown) and colour the out-of-plane velocity. Cross sections were measured at 60,80,100 and 120mm distances from the jet nozzle exit. \n Figure 22. 3D 2\uf06e-PDV cross section measurements on a seeded air jet at 120mm downstream from the nozzle exit. Vectors represent \nthe in plane velocities (every 12th x 12th vector shown) and colour the out-of-plane velocity.  \n \n \nThe combination of the 2\uf06e-PDV technique with the imaging fibre bundles allows 3D velocity measurements \nto be made using only a single camera and iodine cell, greatly reducing the cost and complexity associated \nwith conventional PDV techniques which require six cameras and three iodine cells for 3D measurements. \nThe use of the imaging fibre bundles also allows greater flexibility in the positioning of the observation \ndirections. \n \nAs both signal and reference images are captured on a single camera the pixel-matching problem is \novercome resulting in there being no need to use a 'white card' type correction that is commonly applied in \nPDV measurements. However the images used in the normalisation process are now captured sequentially, \nunlike in conventional PDV where they are captured simultaneously. For steady-state flows this should not \nbe a problem, provided that the seeding is relatively dense and the seeding distribution remains essentially \nunchanged during the time taken to acquire the two images.  \n \nIn a rapidly time-varying flow, averaging over long integration times is not an option; a pulsed laser would \nbe required for this type of flow, to freeze the motion of the particles. An investigation of this is currently \nunder way. \n \nThe ability to further improve the sensitivity of the two-frequency PDV technique, by positioning both \nillumination frequencies on opposite sides of the transfer function, has been demonstrated. By comparison \nwith the theoretical velocity field for a rotating disc a typical reduction in the error of approximately 40% \ncan be achieved using the increased sensitivity scheme. \n Acknowledgement \n \nThis work was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK \n(GR\/SO4291). \n \nReferences \n \n [1] Samimy, M. and Wernet, M.P., 2000, Review of Planar Multiple-Component Velocimetry in High-\nSpeed Flows, AIAA Journal, 38, 4, 553-574. \n [2] Komine, H., Brosnan, S., Litton, A., and Staepperts, E., 1991, Real-Time Doppler Global Velocimetry, \nAIAA 29th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno, Nevada, Paper 91-0337. \n [3] Meyers, J.F. and Lee, J.W., 1991, Proof of concept test of the Doppler Global Velocimeter, \nSpaceborne Photonics: Aerospace Applications Of Lasers And Electro-optics, Newport Beach, CA,  \n [4] Meyers, J.F., Lee, J.W., and Schwartz, R.J., 2001, Characterization of Measurement Error Sources in \nDoppler Global Velocimetry, Measurement Science and Technology, 12, 357-368. \n [5] Ford, H.D. and Tatam, R.P., 1997, Development of Extended Field Doppler Velocimetry for \nTurbomachinery Applications, Optics and Lasers in Engineering, 27, 675-696. \n [6] Roehle, I., Willert, C., Schodl, R., and Voigt, P., 2000, Recent Developments and Applications of \nQuantitative Laser Light Sheet Measuring Techniques in Turbo machinery Components, Measurement \nScience and Technology, 11, 1023-1035. \n [7] Ford, H.D., Nobes, D.S., and Tatam, R.P., 2001, Acousto-optic Frequency switching for single-camera \nplanar Doppler Velocimetry, SPIE proceedings, Optical Diagnostics for Fluids, Solids and \nCombustion, Eds.
