Model experiments with black lipid membranes (BLM) demonstrated\nthat the nanoparticles indeed enhance membrane permeability.\n1. Introduction\nIn any industrial process using freely dispersed microorganisms as catalysts, they need to be\nseparated from the products after catalysis has taken place and the reaction has reached its\nconclusion. Typically, the separation is carried out either by filtration or centrifugation (Luo\nand Sirkar, 2000). This is the first step of the downstream processes required to purify the\nproduct.\nAlthough the free dispersal of microorganisms in a fluid reaction volume optimizes mass\ntransport, it is sometimes difficult to carry out the necessary separation afterwards, and\nusually the separation procedure compromises viability, i.e. the organisms die. Therefore,\nefforts have been made to immobilize bacteria, typically in the form of biofilms coating\n3reaction vessels with high surface to volume ratios1. The starting materials must then simply\nbe made to flow over the biofilm, and no separation is subsequently required (Naito et al.,\n2001). Furthermore, biofilms offer protection to the cells against adverse environmental\nconditions, and to some extent at least they are self-renewing and may therefore be used for\nmany production cycles, or even for continuous rather than batch processes. On the other\nhand, mass transport is much slower than with freely dispersed microorganisms.\nSome DBT biodesulfurization results have been reported using immobilized Rhodococcus\nerythropolis. Naito et al. (2001) immobilized the bacteria by entrapping them with calcium\nalginate, agar and resin polymers; and Prieto et al. (2002) used Biolite beads to support an\nadsorbed network of bacteria on their external surface. Naito et al. (2001) found out that\nusing immobilized cells made it easy to recover desulfurized oil and to use the biocatalyst\nrepeatedly for long periods with reactivation. Immobilization of bacteria by traditional\nentrapment methods has major downsides, however. Mass transfer problems reduce cell\naccess to the substrate and usually lead to a disappointingly low biotransformation activity\n(Xu et al., 2006)2.\nIn order to combine the advantages of immobilization\u2014i.e. ease of separation and microbial\nlongevity\u2014with those of free diffusion\u2014i.e. good mass transport\u2014another approach is\n1 Three major techniques are used for immobilizing bacteria: entrapment, adsorption and coupling\n(Corcoran, 1985). To achieve entrapment, the microbial cells are mixed with a gel-forming polymer,\nyielding pores smaller than the size of the cells. This ensures retention of the cells, but permits\nmovement of nutrients, starting reagents and products. Adsorption means allowing the bacteria to\nform weak chemical bonds to the substrate; electrostatic interactions between a charged support and\ncharged cells have been made use of (Yang and Albayrak, 2006). However, the forces involved in cell\nattachment are then so weak that cells are readily lost from the adsorbent (Shan et al., 2005). To\novercome this problem, cells can be covalently bonded (coupled) to an activated support (Hulst and\nTrumper, 1989).\n2 As an exception to the general rule, D\u00edaz et al. (2002) reported that by immobilization of bacterial\ncells the biodegradation rate of crude oil was significantly enhanced compared to free-living cells.\n4possible, namely to decorate the bacterial cells with magnetic nanoparticles (Shan et al.,\n2005). After completion of the reaction, the bacterial cells can be separated from the\nproducts using a magnetic field. This is a much milder and more cost-effective process than\ncentrifugation, and allows the bacteria to be reused many times (Gupta and Hung, 1989).\nIn the present work we have made use of a widely studied Gram-positive desulfurizing\nbacterial strain, Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8, in order to investigate the effects of\ndecorating the bacteria with magnetic nanoparticles. R. erythropolis is known to be able to\nutilize a wide variety of sulfur compounds as sulfur sources (Kayser et al., 1993) and this\nmicroorganism has been investigated in some detail (Gray et al., 1996; Li et al., 1996; Ansari\net al., 2007). We suspended R. erythropolis in basic salt medium (BSM) containing\ndibenzothiophene (DBT) as the sole source of sulfur, and the DBT degradation ability of R.\nerythropolis was measured with the help of HPLC. DBT was chosen in this study as a model\ncompound for the forms of thiophenic sulfur found in fossil fuels; up to 70% of the sulfur in\npetroleum is found as DBT and substituted DBTs (methylated DBTs); these compounds are\nhowever particularly recalcitrant to hydrodesulfurization (HDS), the current standard\nindustrial method (Yang and Marison, 2005). We have used Fe3O4 as the nanoparticulate\nmaterial; it is chemically stable in the working environment and nontoxic to the bacterium.\nPrevious work by Yang and Albayrak (2006) has moreover suggested that bacteria can be\ndecorated with them by simple adsorption.\n52. Experimental\n2.1 Chemicals\nDibenzothiophene (DBT) (99%), dimethyl sulfoxide, 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP), ferrous\nchloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2.4H2O), ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3.6H2O), glycine,\nRinger\u2019s solution and all other chemicals were from Fisher Scientific (UK), Lipids were from\nSigma, Water was purified by ion exchange and reverse osmosis (ELGA-option3B, Elga\nWater Ltd, UK).\n2.2 Bacterial strain and medium\nRhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 (ATCC 53968) was from American Type Culture\nCollections. The bacteria were grown in basic salt medium (BSM), a sulfur-free medium\ncontaining 2.44 g KH2PO4, 5.47 g Na2HPO4, 2.00 g NH4Cl, 0.2 g MgCl2.6H2O, 0.001 g\nCaCl2 .2H2O, 0.001 g FeCl3 .6H2O, 0.004 g MnCl2 .4H2O and 1.84 g glycerol in 1 L of\ndeionized water. DBT dissolved in ethanol was added to give a final concentration of 0.5 mM\nas the sole sulfur source.\n2.3 Nanoparticle synthesis\nMagnetic nanoparticles were synthesized using the procedure described by Yeh et al., (2004)\nto obtain Fe3O4 nanoparticles: briefly 25 mL of 0.2 M ferrous chloride (FeCl2) was mixed\nwith 100 mL of 0.1 M ferric chloride (FeCl3) solution in a flask at room temperature and then\n3 mL of 2 M HCl solution was added to make the solution slightly acidic. Then 1 g of glycine\nwas added, and 11 mL 5 M NaOH solution was slowly dripped into the mixture to increase\nits pH to over 10, to provide an alkaline environment for Fe3O4 to precipitate; next, an\nadditional 3 g of glycine was added, and the mixture agitated with an FB15024 vortexer\n6(Topmix, UK) for 10\u201315 min and then sonicated for 30 min; subsequently 5 mL acetone was\nadded and agitated. The resulting precipitate (Fe3O4) was isolated with a permanent magnet\nand the supernatant discarded by decantation. The precipitate was washed twice with\nultrapure water followed by centrifugation at 2500 g for 5 min to remove excess ions in the\nsuspension and obtain water-dispersible nanoparticles. Finally, the washed precipitate was\ndispersed in ultrapure water for further investigation. The magnetic nanoparticle\nconcentration is expressed as dry weight per volume of suspension medium.\nA particle diameter of 50 nm was chosen, because if the particles are large, their Brownian\nenergy overwhelms the relatively weak attachment forces. Preliminary experiments using\niron oxide particles with a diameter of 1 \u03bcm (Dynabeads, Dynal Biotech) showed that they\ndid not attach to the bacteria. Furthermore, the particles should be small enough to be\nsuperparamagnetic, i.e. smaller than the critical magnetic domain size (Morrish et al., 1956;\nSchmidt 2001; Zhang et al., 2006). This critical diameter is around 50 nm for our material.\n2.4 Nanoparticle characterization\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were\nused to characterize the particles (Fig.1). In order to prepare TEM samples, the final\nnanoparticle slurry was sonicated for approximately 5 min to better disperse the\nnanoparticles. A drop was placed with a carbon-coated copper TEM grid (200\u2013300 mesh) and\nthen left to dry in air. The particle diameters were determined directly from the TEM images\nto be in the range of 45\u201355 nm (Fig.1A).\n7Fig.1. (A) TEM image of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Capillary forces during drying of the\nsuspension on the grid result in the aggregation visible on the micrographs. (B) SEM\nimage of the synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles.\nFig. 2 shows a bar chart of the sizes. Further characterization of the synthesised Fe3O4\nnanoparticles was obtained using a FEI XL30 field emission SEM (Fig.1B). In order to\nprepare SEM samples, the particle suspension was washed several times in deionized water to\nremove any salt residue, then diluted using deionized water, and finally using a pipette a drop\nwas placed on an Al-stub and left to dry overnight, before mounting the stub on the SEM\nsample holder. The operating voltage was in the range of 10\u201320 kV to minimize charging of\nthe sample. The SEM image were not subjected to quantitative analysis, but merely served to\ngain a visual impression.\n8Fig. 2. Bar chart of the particle sizes from a typical preparation determined from TEM\nimages (a total of 100 particles were measured). Mean size is 47.22 \u00b1 0.96 nm (S.d.)\nMagnetic hysteresis loops of the samples were measured using a Magnetic Measurements\n(Peterson Instruments, UK) variable field translation balance (MMVFTB). Saturation\nmagnetization (9.9 emu\/g) was obtained from the hysteresis loop resulting from applying a\nmagnetic field from -8 to +8 kOe (Fig. 3). The paramagnetic component was removed by\nassessing the gradient of the magnetization curve (B vs H) once saturation had been reached.\nIt should be emphasized that the residual magnetization is almost negligible for these\nparticles, which is very likely important for achiving good dispersibility of the nanoparticles\nin a fluid.\n9Fig.3. Magnetic hysteresis loop of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles measured at room\ntemperature. The paramagnetic component of the magnetization has been removed\naccording to a standard procedure.\nPowder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were performed between 10\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 with a copper\nX-ray source (Siemens). The XRD pattern of the nanoparticles indicates the presence of\npredominantly Fe3O4 crystals (Fig. 4).\nFig.4. X-ray diffraction pattern of the nanoparticles. The numbers in parenthesis give\nthe Miller indices of pure Fe3O4 (NBS, 1976) assigned to the observed peaks.\n10\nThe zeta potentials of the prepared nanoparticles suspended in deionized water (100 \u03bcg\/mL)\nwere measured using a 3000HS Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd, UK).\nFig.5. Surface charges of the Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles suspended in water at 25 \u00b0C\nas a function of pH, changed by appropriate additions of 2 M HCl or NaOH.\nThe pH of the as-prepared particles in suspension was 7.0 \u00b1 0.2. The variation of the zeta\npotential with pH (Fig. 5) revealed that the isoelectric point of the particles is 9.0. Hence at\npH 7, at which the bacteria are negatively charged, they will electrostatically attract the\nnanoparticles.\n2.5 Cell growth and decoration\nThe bacteria were grown in BSM until the mid-exponential growth phase and harvested by\ncentrifugation at 1400 g for 10 min. The cell pellets were washed twice with Ringer\u2019s\nsolution and resuspended back in BSM at a concentration of 5.6 mg dry cells\/L. The cells\nwere then decorated with magnetic nanoparticles as follows: 10 mL of a suspension\n11\ncontaining 100 \u00b5g\/mL Fe3O4 nanoparticles per mL of water were mixed with 100 mL of the\ncell suspension in BSM at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The ratio of nanoparticle mass to\nbiomass is 1.78 w\/w. We estimated that this ratio makes sufficient particles available per\nbacterium to yield a suitable level of decoration. The resulting successful separation (Fig. 6)\ndid not require subsequent optimization.\nFig.6. Photograph of nanoparticle-coated cells (Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8) in\nEppendorf tubes showing, successively: (A) dispersed cells coated with magnetic\nnanoparticles; (B and C) coated cells were gradually concentrated and collected\ntowards the rear of the tube by an external permanent magnet (within the white\nhousing behind the tubes); (D) liquid medium free of suspended nanoparticles, which\nare visible as a thin dark stripe at the back of the tube.\n2.6 Batch biodesulfurization of DBT\nBiodesulfurization was carried out using the cells in 100 mL of BSM containing DBT at a\nfinal concentration of 0.5 mM, in a 250 mL flask incubated on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm and\n30 \u00baC (0.5 mM of DBT are equivalent to 0.092 g DBT\/L). For analysis of the supernatant by\nHPLC, it should not contain any contamination (like free bacteria or other nonmagnetic\ncontamination) that would damage the HPLC column. Therefore, prior to analysing the\n12\nsupernatant, the cells were separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation at 6600 g\nfor 10 min, so that the same procedure could be used for both decorated & nondecorated\ncontrols.\n2.7 Product analysis\nThe concentrations of DBT and HBP were analyzed by high-performance liquid\nchromatography (HPLC) using a HPLC Model LC-10AD VP (Shimadzu) equipped with a\nNova Pak phenyl column (3.9\uf0b4150 mm) with a guard column. Isocratic elution with 60%\nacetonitrile and 40% water at 1.5 mL min-1 was carried out and detection was realized with a\n117 UV detector fixed at a wavelength of 233 nm. The mobile phase, a mixture of HPLC\ngrade water and acetonitrile, was sonicated for 10 min, and further deaerated with helium\nbefore use.\n2.8 Nanoparticle-induced membrane permeability assay\nLipid bilayer membranes were formed by the method of Mueller et al. (1962) from a\ncardiolipids:phosphatidylcholine 5:95 mixture mimicking the bacterial outer membrane. The\nmembrane current was measured by an OPA 129 operational amplifier (Burr-Brown) used as\na current-to-voltage converter.\n3. Results\n3.1 Visualization of decoration\nScanning electron micrographs of the surfaces of cells decorated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles are\nshown in Fig. 7, which clearly shows that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were adsorbed on the\nsurface of the bacteria.\n13\nFig.7. SEM images of two different Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 bacteria decorated\nwith magnetic nanoparticles. The bacterium shown on the right panel is about to\nundergo division.\n3.2 Magnetic separation\nFig. 6 shows a suspension of bacteria coated by nanoparticles in a holder equipped with a\nremovable slide-out magnet: the decorated cells in the liquid culture medium could easily be\nseparated by bringing an external magnet into their vicinity.\n3.3 Biodesulfurization\nFig. 8 compares the degradation of DBT with nondecorated and nanoparticle-coated cells.\nThe results show that the production of HBP was significantly higher in the latter. It can be\nseen that whereas the production rate of the nondecorated cells falls off to almost zero after\nabout 70 h, the decorated bacteria continue producing more vigorously until at least 100 h,\nwith a concomitant increase in DBT HBP conversion.\n14\nFig.8. Degradation of DBT by R. erythropolis IGTS8 without (left) and with (right)\ndecoration by nanoparticles, in BSM with DBT at the initial (t = 0) concentration of 0.5\nmM as the sole sulfur source. concentration of DBT, concentration of HBP.\nThe bacteria were present at a concentration of 4 \uf0b4 107 cm-3.\n4. Discussion\nThe main discovery emerging from these experiments is that the decorated bacteria are\nsignificantly more active in desulfurization. Here we discuss possible reasons, starting with\nthe open issue whether the biodesulfurization takes place within the cytoplasm or at the\nbacterial surface.\n4.1 Degradation pathway\nThe first and rate-limiting step in the oxidative desulfurization of DBT and other sulfur\ncompounds in living organisms is apparently transfer of DBT from the oil to the cell (Setti et\nal., 1999). In support of this, Folsom et al. (1999) found that the overall rate kinetics were\naffected by the concentration and distribution of the DBT. It is then oxidized to HBP in\nseveral steps by desulfurizing (Dsz) enzymes as illustrated in Scheme 1. These enzymes are\n15\nsoluble and presumably found in the cytoplasm (Marcelis, 2003). On the other hand, there is\nno evidence that the DBT molecules are actively transported into the cell (Monticello, 2000).\nPatel et al. (1997) attributed the mass transfer of the very hydrophobic DBT to the\nhydrophobic nature of the Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS8 surface, because of their finding\nthat desulfurization activity is correlated to the external surface hydrophobicity of the IGTS8\nwall\/membrane. It might therefore be supposed that at least some of the enzymes are located\nin the wall\/membrane region3.\nScheme 1. Proposed (so called 4S) pathway for DBT desulfurization by R. erythropolis.\nThe DBT desulfurization pathway results in the formation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP)\nand sulfate, via the Dsz enzymes (cf. Van Hamme et al., 2003).\n3 This suggests that some of the desulfurization enzymes should function in nonaqueous solvents,\nwhich consequently would facilitate contact with the oil phase and enhance mass transfer during\nbiodesulfurization. In the other words, the Rhodococcus strains should be able to access to DBT\ndirectly from the oil (Monticello, 2000). This is consistent with the large body of work reporting\ngrowth of R. erythropolis IGTS8 on hydrocarbons such as hexadecane (Solano et al., 1999).\n16\nIt is not presently known how the product, HBP, leaves the cells (Monticello, 2000) \u2014\nassuming it is produced in the cytoplasm, not on the bacterial surface. At any rate the HBP\nreleased into the oil maintains fuel value (Gray et al., 1996). However, this compound is toxic\nto bacterial cells; hence growth and biodesulfurization activity become inhibited by its\naccumulation (Zhang et al., 2005). The sulfate formed during the 4S pathway remains in the\naqueous phase and will combine with any ions \u2014 e.g. sodium, ammonium, calcium \u2014 that\nare present in the medium (McFarland et al., 1998), and might be assimilated by other\nmicroorganisms (Kilbane and Bielaga, 1990).\n4.2 Membrane permeabilization\nThe observation of significantly increased HBP production in the decorated cells suggests\nthat the magnetic nanoparticles somehow facilitate transport of HBP out of the cells \u2014\nassuming that it is produced in the cytoplasm. A possible mechanism for the enhancement is\nthat the nanoparticles bound to the bacteria make their membranes more permeable. In order\nto investigate this hypothesis, the possible effect of nanoparticles on membrane permeability\nwas assessed in a model membrane system mimicking the outer bacterial membrane\n(Grigoriev, 2002). Fig. 9 shows typical results. They provide evidence for nanoparticle-\ninduced permeabilization, supporting the proposed enhanced ingress of DBT into the\ndecorated bacterial cells.\n17\nFig.9. Temporal change of membrane current (ordinate), in the presence of\nnanoparticles. The sensitivity of the current recording device was changed during the\nrecording (at the moments marked by arrows) from 1 nA\/V at the start of the trace to 1\n\uf06dA\/V at the end. Conditions: nanoparticle concentration 300 \uf06dg\/mL, 200 mM KCl, pH\n6, transmembrane voltage 60 mV. The plane of the lipid bilayer was vertical and it was\nsituated about 10 mm above the floor of the glass chamber. Calibrations: vertical 5 pA\n(initially), horizontal 10 s.\nIn the model experiments, the added nanoparticles diffuse to the surface of the membrane and\nare adsorbed. The adsorbed particles diffuse within the membrane, and self-assemble into a\nconducting transmembrane system, resulting in an increased transmembrane current. Step by\nstep the membrane conductance is increased: it is a dynamic, reversible process, the pore-\nforming substance can also leave the membrane and the conductance then decreases. The\nstep-like fluctuations of the membrane current at the start of the trace probably correspond to\nthe formation of discrete ion-conducting 20 pS pores.\n18\nTable 1.

The integrated form is\nkBt\nD\nH \uf02d\uf03d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\n0\n1ln (2)\nwhere D0 is the initial DBT concentration (0.5 mM). Linear regression of the data from Fig.\n8 according to eqn (2) yields k (Table 1). It can be seen that decoration increases the\nbiodesulphurization activity by 56%.\n19\n5. Conclusions\nWe decorated bacteria with Fe3O4 nanoparticles to facilitate cell separation at the end of the\ndesulfurization process; decoration is facilitated by electrostatic attraction between the\nnanoparticles and the bacteria. The synthesized nanoparticles are dispersible in water and\nbiological media. Magnetic separation is compatible with any automated platform that can be\nequipped with a magnet.\nWe found that we could thereby achieve a 56% higher rate of desulfurization. We favour the\nview that the rate limiting step of the process is transport of DBT into the cell, where it\nundergoes desulfurization. We show that the nanoparticles increase the permeability of a\nmodel black lipid membrane, and infer that they thereby enhance ingress of the DBT into the\ncell.\nMagnetic nanoparticle- decorated Rhodococcus also facilitates its recovery and reuse; hence\nit offers a number of advantages for industrial applications compared to nondecorated cells.\nThe nanoparticles are easy to prepare from rather cheap precursor materials, and are therefore\nsuitable for large scale industrial applications. The generation of stable, inexpensive and\nnontoxic adjunct materials for use with microbial cells greatly facilitates the separation of the\ncells from the products during bioreactor process development, and the removal of the cells\nfrom the medium at any time via magnetic decantation.\n20\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Mimi Hill for the magnetization measurements carried out at Liverpool University\nand Qi Zhang & Matthew Kershaw (Cranfield University) for help with the zeta potential\nmeasurements and XRD respectively.\nReferences\nAnsari F, Prayuenyong P, Tothill I. 2007.
