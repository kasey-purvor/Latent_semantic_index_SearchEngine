Arguing that the film fits into a specific \u2018puzzle film\u2019 \ncategory favouring self-deceiving protagonists and surprise twists, the essay seeks to \naccount for the negative critical reaction accrued by the film\u2019s denouement. Most \ncentrally, I invoke the Russian Formalist\u2019s concept of the \u2018dominant\u2019 in order to \nsuggest how Secret Window subordinates textual elements to the film\u2019s narrative \nrevelation. It is this prioritising of the main plot twist that accounts for many of the \nfilm\u2019s dramaturgically contentious tactics. The essay demonstrates the means by \nwhich Secret Window cuts against the grain of Hollywood storytelling norms; it \nsuggests that the film manipulates character engagement in a way that exceeds the \npuzzle film\u2019s traditional reshuffling of sympathies; and it indicates how the film \ndeploys generic convention and allusion to engender a highly self-conscious and \nrepressive narration. These arguments aim to show that the film displays bold and \nsophisticated aesthetic strategies. More broadly, the essay argues that by analysing \nproblematic examples of a film genre, we can usefully disclose the aesthetic principles \nthat underpin the genre\u2019s more successful films. \n \nRecent Hollywood cinema has elaborated an extant fascination with self-deceptive \nprotagonists and shock twists.\n1\n In particular, a few films anchor revelation in a \nfundamental aspect of the protagonist\u2019s identity. Until the revelation\u2019s disclosure, this \nhidden but essential aspect is repressed by the character and concealed from the \nspectator. The protagonist may be dead (as in The Sixth Sense, 1999 and The Others, \n2001) or assailed by another, altogether more malevolent personality (e.g. Fight Club, \n1999). In all such films, the epistemic hierarchy aligns protagonist and viewer: the \nviewer\u2019s coming into knowledge is concurrent with the protagonist\u2019s moment of \nanagnorisis. In a recent study of modern Hollywood cinema, David Bordwell \nincludes these movies within a discussion of contemporary \u2018puzzle films\u2019: that is, \nfilms which organise narrative suspense around a central enigma, repress crucial story \ninformation, provoke inaccurate hypotheses, and equivocate about the objectivity of \nnarrative action. Bordwell\u2019s examples encompass such twist films as The Game \n(1997), Memento (2001), and The Usual Suspects (1995), as well as The Sixth Sense, \nFight Club, and The Others (Bordwell, 2006, pp.80-2). The puzzle film is a wider \n 3 \ncategory than will be evident from the films I am concerned with here. Not every \npuzzle film, for example, will root its chief enigma in a revelation of character \nidentity. \n     Despite the popularity of these puzzle films, the narrative paradigm they employ \ndoes not ensure critical success. Two recent Hollywood films \u2013 Secret Window (2004) \nand Hide and Seek (2005) \u2013 apply the paradigm in apparently problematic ways. \nConsider this representative sample of critical opinion on Secret Window\u2019s late-\narriving twist. For one critic, the film \u2018starts out promisingly but goes spectacularly \noff the rails\u2019 (Leyland, 2004, p.78); another opines that \u2018there is something awry in \nthe movie\u2019s construction\u2019 (Wilmington, 2004); and still another accuses director-\nwriter David Koepp of \u2018serving up a colossal\u2026stinker\u2019 in the final act (Lim, 2004).2 \nIf Secret Window capitalises on a successful narrative trend, what constructional \nmanoeuvres are responsible for the apparent failure of its narrative revelation?  \n     In what follows, I seek to disclose and account for Secret Window\u2019s \u2018problematic\u2019 \naesthetic strategies. I set these strategies against the film\u2019s most proximate contexts, \ni.e. the particular brand of puzzle film described above, and the (\u2018post\u2019-) classical \nHollywood cinema more generally. In this way, I aim to show that Secret Window \nactively explores mainstream cinema\u2019s parameters of character revelation. Most \nproblematically, I argue, the film sacrifices certain dramaturgical (or \u2018extrinsic\u20193) \nnorms to narrative surprise. By elevating its twist above other constructional \nprinciples, the film effects some radical revisions to classical conceptions of \ncharacter. Devolving from this, I go on to establish how the maintenance of character \nin Secret Window complicates viewer sympathy and calls attention to narrational \nprocesses. By centring my analysis on Secret Window, I seek not only to lay bare the \nformal patterning of an individual film, but to sharpen the focus on key structural \nnorms underpinning both the puzzle film and Hollywood narratives in general. \nIsolating Secret Window\u2019s deviations from convention thus sets in relief the very \nnorms that the film violates.\n4\n \n     Adapted from a novella by Stephen King, Secret Window invokes other King \nadaptations \u2013 The Shining (1980) and Misery (1990) \u2013 in its focus on a writer \nprotagonist.\n5\n Six months after discovering his wife Amy (Maria Bello) in an affair \nwith Ted (Timothy Hutton), Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) languishes alone in a \nlakefront cabin. There, Mort is confronted by Shooter (John Turturro), a Mississippian \ndairy farmer who accuses Mort of plagiarising a story he claims to have written. \n 4 \nShooter lays down an ultimatum: within three days, Mort must provide proof that his \nstory is an original work, or else Shooter will exact revenge. Mort is also instructed to \nrework the story\u2019s climax, so that the fictive protagonist kills his wife.  \n     After his pet dog is ominously skewered by a work tool, Mort enlists the help of \nKarsch (Charles S. Dutton), a private detective. More disquieting incidents occur, \nincluding the burning down of Amy\u2019s house. To discredit Shooter\u2019s plagiarist \nallegations, Mort arranges courier delivery of the magazine in which his story was \noriginally published. He takes more immediate action by planning to rendezvous with \nKarsch and Tom Greenleaf, a local resident who has glimpsed Shooter in the woods. \nDiscovering Karsch and Greenleaf murdered, and his own axe and screwdriver \nembedded in the victims\u2019 heads, Mort disposes of their bodies for fear of being \nframed. As his sanity ebbs away, Mort is struck by a shattering realisation: Shooter is \na figment of his own schizoid mind, an epiphany corroborated by flashbacks revealing \nMort engaged in the earlier crimes. When Amy and Ted arrive at the lake cabin, Mort \nkills them and buries them in his \u2018secret garden\u2019 \u2013 an eventuality that dovetails with \nthe revised story ending proposed by Shooter. \n \nClassicism and innovation \nInvoking the Russian Formalist concept of the \u2018dominant\u2019 best allows us to \ncomprehend Secret Window\u2019s eccentric narrational manoeuvres. The dominant, as \nRoman Jakobson defined it in 1935, is \u2018the focusing component of a work of art: it \nrules, determines, and transforms the remaining components\u2019 (Jakobson, 1971, p.82). \nAs Kristin Thompson later characterised it, \u2018the dominant is a formal principle that \ncontrols the work at every level, from the local to the global, foregrounding some \ndevices and subordinating others\u2019 (Thompson, 1988, p.89). In Secret Window, the \ndominant is the narrative epiphany that Shooter and Mort are the same person. This \nnarrative fact displays primacy over other aspects of narrative construction, and \ndetermines \u2018the role and structure of the other components\u2019 (Jakobson, 1971, p.83). \nSecret Window will chance some radical departures from canonic filmmaking norms \nin order to prioritise and conceal its main plot twist (i.e. its dominant).\n6\n The \nrevelation, moreover, exerts transformative influence upon ensuing story material, \nparticularly with respect to the film\u2019s internal framework of character engagement and \nsympathy.  \n 5 \n     I will discuss this latter phenomenon in the next section. For now, let us lay out \nsome of the film\u2019s putatively \u2018disturbing\u2019 revisions to classical narrative. Many of \nthese revisions, we will find, are traceable to the film\u2019s dominant, that is, the narrative \ntwist around which the film is structured. (Likewise, critical dissatisfaction with \nSecret Window is largely relatable to effects wrought by its key revelation.) We will \nfind, moreover, that the film\u2019s contravention of extrinsic norms does not indicate \nstructural ineptness, as some critics have implied, so much as a propensity for bold \nand experimental storytelling. Upon closer inspection, then, we can elucidate and \nsmooth down some of the film\u2019s more problematic elements. \n     Most Hollywood films, as Kristin Thompson points out, favour \u2018clear, gradual \ncharacter change\u2019 (Thompson, 1999, p.43). A character\u2019s psychological growth will \ntypically be mapped across several phases of story action, the better to show how \nnarrative events steadily shape an agent\u2019s attitudes and beliefs. In As Good As It Gets \n(1997), a \u2018neoclassical\u2019 film which traces a broad arc of character change, the \ntransformation of Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) from misanthrope to philanthropist \nis matched to the film\u2019s entire running length. Along the way, Melvin encounters \nvarious characters and situations that teach him the value of self-improvement. To be \nsure, many Hollywood films require their protagonist to undergo a less extreme \nchange of personality than that traced in As Good As It Gets. Often, character change \namounts to ironing out flaws rather than to a steep volte-face in character behaviour. \nIn any case, the principle that governs character development in these subtler \ninstances is still that of modulated psychological change. The character\u2019s emergent \ntraits crystallise as the narrative events unfold. \n     Daringly, Secret Window employs gambits of character change that contravene \nHollywood convention. First, the film flouts the kind of graduated character \ndevelopment outlined above. Because character change is here the crux of narrative \nsurprise, the narration cannot overtly signal Mort\u2019s gradual change into Shooter. To \ndo so would be to expose and extinguish the main revelation (i.e. that which I have \nidentified as the dominant). As a result of the film\u2019s suppressive tactics, Mort\u2019s \nmetamorphosis strikes the viewer as sudden and unmotivated, rather than as a gradual \ntransformation shaped by earlier story events. To speak of character development in \nthis context risks underplaying the disjunctive nature of character change in the film.  \n     Second, whereas conventional films engender a gradual change in the hero\u2019s \npersonality, Secret Window posits a sudden change in its protagonist\u2019s identity. From \n 6 \nthe revelation onward, Mort is Shooter in all but physical appearance.\n7\n With little \napparent regard for character consistency, the film supplants Mort\u2019s established traits \nwith the malignant attitudes and desires of Shooter. A more traditional approach to \ncharacter change is exemplified in As Good As It Gets. As the story progresses, some \nof Melvin\u2019s character traits gradually evolve while others remain constant. In this \nway, personality change occurs against a baseline of basically stable traits by which \nwe individuate the character. Melvin can thus trace a quite broad arc of change which \nposes no serious threat to character consistency. Psychological growth in As Good As \nIt Gets \u2013 by conventional standards, an \u2018extreme\u2019 example of character change in \nHollywood dramaturgy \u2013 is therefore quite distinct from the kind of bold character \ntransformation found in Secret Window.\n8\n  \n     Once its narrative revelation is out of the bag, Secret Window forces the spectator \nto revise prior moral judgements about Mort. Again, character consistency is put at \nrisk. \u2018Forgivable\u2019 character flaws established at the outset, such as slothfulness, \nparanoia, and plagiarist tendencies, hardly prepare us for the murderous intent with \nwhich Mort is now endowed. Tracing a protagonist\u2019s moral degeneration is not \nwithout precedent, of course. Though it is still the Hollywood norm to present \u2018nice \npeople\u2026becoming nicer\u2019 (Bordwell, 2006, p.83), some films plot the moral \ndegeneration of their initially nice heroes. But here, too, screenwriting laws of \nplausibility and causality mandate that change be wrought in stages. The corruption of \nMichael Corleone (Al Pacino) is played out across almost the entire length of The \nGodfather (1972), while Anakin Skywalker\u2019s withdrawal to the \u2018dark side\u2019 occurs \nextremely gradually, spanning three Star Wars films (1999, 2002, 2005).  \n     In Secret Window, however, we are asked to come to terms with what we perceive \nto be a radical break in Mort\u2019s moral valence. The protagonist\u2019s new capacity for \nmurder takes us by surprise. At the level of story, in fact, Mort\u2019s moral upheaval is \nnot as abrupt as it first appears. Action prior to the revelation can be taken as \nrepresenting Mort\u2019s gradual transmogrification into Shooter: this foregoing action \npresents Mort becoming acquainted with, conversant with, and finally acquiescent to \nthe amoral spectre haunting his unconscious. That Mort\u2019s moral transfiguration does \nnot occur to us as gradual, but on the contrary as unprepared and surprising, is again \nattributable to a restricted narration with suppressed gaps \u2013 a narration that aims to \npreserve the integrity of the plot\u2019s major twist (i.e. the dominant). If the twist is to be \npotent in surprise, the narration must repress information pertaining to Mort\u2019s crisis of \n 7 \nmorality. In privileging the forcefulness of the twist, then, the filmmakers boldly \nreject tactics of foreshadowing that would cue the viewer gradually to Mort\u2019s shifting \nmoral state. \n     None of this is to assert that abrupt character change, identity switches, and moral \nu-turns are without precedent in Hollywood narrative, only that such tactics are \nexceptional (especially the co-ordinating of all three tactics at once).\n9\n We can sketch \nin the horror genre as a pertinent context for these collective devices. Some horror \nfilms will transform morally good characters into malevolent ones (as in The \nAmityville Horror (1979) and The Shining), though again psychological change tends \nto be engendered quite gradually, and is often signalled during an early phase in the \nnarrative. Psycho (1960) anticipates more closely the narrative strategies evinced in \nSecret Window, especially as it dovetails character change and a deus ex machina. \nPsycho, however, places less emphasis on the protagonist\u2019s moment of anagnorisis \nthan does Secret Window or the other films that I am considering here.\n10\n If Secret \nWindow finds forebears in the horror genre, its strategies exceed or transgress the \nconventions of its other pertinent and proximate contexts (namely, the contemporary \nHollywood film in general, and the Hollywood puzzle film in particular).  \n     Particularly courageous is Secret Window\u2019s mapping of character goals. Early \nphases of action clearly establish Mort\u2019s primary goal: he must disprove Shooter\u2019s \nallegation of plagiarism, and so resolve their hostile impasse. A second goal requires \nMort to salvage his marriage to Amy. In plot terms, both goals are drastically \ncurtailed by the main revelation (wherein Mort\u2019s psychological traits, including his \ngoals, are vanquished by Shooter\u2019s supersession). Abandoning these goals risks \nvexing the spectator who engages emotionally in Mort\u2019s goal-oriented activity. \nMoreover, the twist exposes the triviality of Mort\u2019s principal goal, which is neither \nresolved nor further elaborated by the narrative.\n11\n Whether Mort plagiarised from \nShooter becomes a question both tail-chasing and academic in light of the revelation \nthat they both are the same person. The film\u2019s chief character goal, then, comes to be \nviewed by the spectator as fundamentally inconsequential. Secret Window thus \nchances a risky manoeuvre: by undermining the significance of the plagiarism story, \nthe twist removes the very underpinnings of the film\u2019s main conflict. \n     Once more, however, the narrative revelation spurs us to review character goals. \nRetroactively, we ascribe additional, unconscious goals to Mort which tacitly run \nparallel to his more transparent desires. These repressed goals are less sharply defined \n 8 \nthan his explicit desires, but we can infer that both sets of desires are mutually \noppositional: at an unconscious level, Mort pursues incongruous desires to both \nemancipate and restrain his perverse alter-ego. Often an unconscious goal will keep in \ncheck one or both of the transparent goals. Midway through the film, for example, \nMort and a private detective, Karsch, arrange to meet an elderly local named Tom \nGreenleaf. Greenleaf, Mort claims, has witnessed Shooter and Mort conversing in the \nwoods. In setting up the rendezvous with Karsch and Greenleaf, Mort acts on a \nconscious desire to determine more about the figure terrorizing him. Yet, at an \nunconscious level, Mort knows that Greenleaf could not possibly have seen Shooter \n(since Shooter does not exist); the old man will surely testify that Mort was alone in \nthe woods. Shooter kills the two men before Greenleaf can provide testimony that \nwould push Mort closer to self-discovery. Mort\u2019s latent desire to keep Shooter \nenigmatic thus intervenes in his conscious course of action.  \n     Retrospectively, then, the spectator comprehends the undulations of plot \u2013 its \nadvancing and retarding of character objectives \u2013 not as resulting from the conflicting \ngoals of two discrete antagonists, but from an interplay of the repressed and conscious \ndesires possessed by a single agent. Taken together, Mort\u2019s and Shooter\u2019s cluster of \ngoals aptly delineates a single internally-conflicted psychology. \n     Recognising the duality of Mort\u2019s actions allows us to re-evaluate initially \nunsatisfying plot manoeuvres. For instance, we can now qualify our belief that Secret \nWindow abandons Mort\u2019s goals. Rather, only some of his goals are discarded \u2013 \nnamely, those consciously pursued, narratively transparent objectives. So the \nrevelation may forsake certain explicit goals, but it signals the achievement of a key \n\u2018unconscious\u2019 goal, i.e. to permit Shooter full anarchic reign. From this angle, \napparent dramaturgical ineptness begins to look like fairly adventurous storytelling, \nmotivating action by the protagonist\u2019s latent rather than explicit desires. \n     Secret Window transgresses Hollywood narrative in still other ways. Like The \nSixth Sense, Fight Club, and The Others, the film achieves narrative surprise by \nexploiting basic and habitual assumptions. We ordinarily assume (unless, that is, \ngenre conventions or narrative cueing indicate otherwise) that a coherent and \nanimated body designates a living human agent \u2013 an assumption that leads us awry in \nThe Sixth Sense and The Others. Secret Window violates another of the viewer\u2019s \u2018low-\nlevel\u2019 assumptions: character individuation. It does this by forcing the viewer to \nmisapply character individuation; that is, to individuate agents inappropriately. In \n 9 \nview of their shared identity, Mort and Shooter ought not to be individuated \ndiscretely, yet the film daringly encourages just this process of discrimination by \nemploying two physically dissimilar performers in the roles.\n12\n Differing external cues \nthus mark Shooter and Mort as discrete agents, and deflect hypotheses that might \nanticipate the main revelation. Once more, then, the dominant is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of \naesthetic risk.   \n     Our assumption that the narration presents Shooter from a vantage point of \nobjectivity is also undercut. Not only is our individuation of character wrongheaded, \nbut, we realise, every view of Shooter is focalised subjectively through Mort\u2019s skewed \nperspective. Here, Secret Window manipulates its own motivic system as a means by \nwhich to mislead the viewer and conceal narrative surprise. Some films codify \nfocalisation or character point of view by opposing colour and black & white \nsequences.\n13\n Similarly in Secret Window, dream sequences and subjective flashbacks \nare recurrently characterised by reverberative sound effects, desaturated images, \noverexposed lighting, and handheld camerawork. Occasionally, however, the film will \ndepart from this codification of subjective action. A few flashbacks are rendered in \nthe film\u2019s orthodox (if occasionally flamboyant) aural and visual style. Stylistic cues \nfor subjective action are not, therefore, unequivocally and consistently demarcated in \nthe film. Consequently, Secret Window can justify rendering certain subjective events \n\u2013 most significantly, Mort\u2019s hallucination of Shooter \u2013 in the film\u2019s overarching, \n\u2018objective\u2019 audiovisual style. Rather than transparently differentiating subjective and \nobjective points of view, the narration obfuscates these perceptual boundaries, \nthrowing into doubt the objective nature of action preceding the revelation. \n     Also undermined is our tacit assumption that the protagonist perceives events \naccurately. As in The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, and The Others, Secret Window\u2019s \nprotagonist is an unreliable focaliser of story action. More generally, these films teem \nwith motifs of misperception. Characters may perceive events through mediated \nsurfaces, such as eyeglasses, telescopes, or rear-view mirrors.\n14\n Minor characters may \nbe literally sightless, as is the elderly clairvoyant in The Others. (In Secret Window, \nMort\u2019s chief companion is a blind dog.) Sleep becomes a prominent metaphor for \nflawed perception, and in Secret Window hints at the protagonist\u2019s conversance with \nhis unconscious. All the films link visual impairment with the protagonists\u2019 \ninaccuracies of knowledge. And these themes and motifs acquire deeper resonance by \n 10 \nmirroring the viewer\u2019s off-center hypotheses. Narrative revelation will expose these \nperceptual errors, and elucidate aural and visual motifs of (mis)perception.\n15\n  \n     For all its narrative experimentation, Secret Window remains rooted in classical \nstorytelling principles. David Bordwell has shown how puzzle films, and so-called \npostclassical films in general, rely on classical principles of narrative form and style \n(Bordwell, 2006). Innovation flourishes within the parameters of classical narration. \nLikewise, in Secret Window aesthetic risk stands out against a ground of classical \nconvention. Even the revelation sequence conforms to classical norms of staging, \ncontinuity editing, sound design, and so on. Against these \u2018stable\u2019 elements, the film\u2019s \nexperimental play with character and story organisation acquires special salience. (At \nthe level of story construction, too, familiar structural mechanisms underlay narrative \nexperimentation; some typical or classical norms such as formal symmetry \u2013 here \nimplemented by a prologue and epilogue \u2013 are faithfully hewn to.)  \n     Secret Window\u2019s revelation exposes other classical gambits. Consider the \ninstigation of Mort\u2019s primary goal, which is retroactively accorded a subtle but \nsignificant change in emphasis. \u2018Hollywood protagonists,\u2019 observes one scholar, \u2018tend \nto be active, to seek out goals and pursue them rather than having goals simply thrust \nupon them\u2019 (Thompson, 1999, p.14). Initially, by contrast, we believe Mort\u2019s \nprincipal goal to have been thrust upon him: Shooter unexpectedly arrives at Mort\u2019s \ndoor and issues an ultimatum. This apparent deviation from the classical norm is \nimportant, because it situates Mort as the victim of events \u2013 a circumstance that \ncrucially helps stack sympathy in his favour. When the revelation arrives, the genesis \nof Mort\u2019s goal assumes a new composition: obliquely, we realise, Mort himself \nengendered the goal, and thus an initial platform for sympathy is retrospectively \nplaned down. Ironically, despite its subversive functions and effects, the main \nrevelation here works to sharpen a classical tactic; that is, the twist reveals Mort\u2019s \ngoal to be more classical than we had originally construed. \n     Bold, radical strategies mask a \u2018classical\u2019, ideologically conservative affirmation \nof the family. Both Secret Window and Hide and Seek relate the protagonist\u2019s mental \ndissolution to familial dysfunction. An unfaithful wife precipitates the dysfunction in \nboth films. Character motivation here finds an ideal generic context: observing the \n\u2018connection of the Family to Horror\u2019, Robin Wood has argued that \u2018the \npsychotic\/schizophrenic, the Antichrist and the child-monster are all shown as \nproducts of the family, whether the family itself is regarded as guilty\u2026or innocent\u2019 \n 11 \n(Wood, 2003, pp.75-6). Motivating the protagonist\u2019s psychosis by marital breakdown \nalso invites the viewer to infer, by reverse logic, that emotional wellbeing is derivable \nfrom familial stability. In important respects, then, ideological conservatism and \ngeneric convention underlie the film\u2019s daring narrational manoeuvres.16  \n     Still, we have seen that Secret Window is hardly a paradigm case of classical \nstorytelling. Character traits, typically corrigible in the classical film, are here usurped \nin abrupt and immoderate ways; the protagonist\u2019s moral valence is likewise \noverturned with apparent little foreshadowing; character goals are ostensibly \nabandoned, and issues seemingly at stake in the narrative are dissolved; character \nindividuation is travestied; and the viewer\u2019s tacit assumptions of narrational \nobjectivity and reliability are crudely undercut. Much of what the viewer experiences \nas narrative \u2018disturbance\u2019 we have accredited to the film\u2019s dominant, i.e. its main twist \nand the tactics employed to preserve it. Similarly recalcitrant of classical convention, \nand equally traceable (but not reducible) to the main revelation, is the film\u2019s anarchic \nplay with character engagement. \nReshuffling allegiance \nNarrative revelation in the \u2018puzzle film\u2019 tends to challenge our engagement with \ncharacter in a number of ways. Most basically, the twist typically effects a general \nredistribution of sympathies. Secondary and minor characters may turn out to have \nbeen harshly judged by the spectator, and now stake a claim for our compassion (e.g. \nMarla in Fight Club, the servants in The Others, and the grief-stricken neighbors in \nHide and Seek). The revelation may function to flatten out undesirable traits in the \nprotagonist, and deepen our allegiance with her (e.g. Grace may elicit greater \nsympathy once The Others\u2019 twist is revealed, for the revelation supplies knowledge \nby which we can better understand her fraught behaviour).\n17\n Typically, while our \nsympathy with supporting characters may alter quite drastically, our allegiance with \nthe main protagonist is apt to remain relatively stable.  \n     A more radical reshuffling of viewer sympathy is achieved in Secret Window. The \nrevelation forces us to both drastically revise our moral judgement of the protagonist \nand to recast or nuance our evaluation of secondary agents. Neither The Sixth Sense \nnor The Others challenges us in this way. Grasping the main twist in The Sixth Sense \ndoes not entail that we re-evaluate Malcolm in moral terms, only that we revise our \njudgement of him as a reliable focaliser of events. Though his range of knowledge \nmay be exposed as deficient, Malcolm continues to embody the moral values upon \n 12 \nwhich our allegiance rests. Even Fight Club\u2019s revelation poses no serious challenge to \nour sympathetic engagement with The Narrator. Secret Window, however, shakes up \nallegiance more comprehensively, generating ambivalence around its main \nprotagonist, and putting the viewer\u2019s moral assumptions into disarray. \n     One way in which the film complicates allegiance is by tampering with the \nphysical specificity of its protagonists. Secret Window\u2019s revelation marks the end of \nShooter as a bodily autonomous agent. Thereafter, \u2018Shooter\u2019 is perceptible only as a \nset of mental dispositions \u2018channelled\u2019 through the physical dimensions of Mort. By \ncollapsing hero and antagonist into a single body, Secret Window complicates the \nspectator\u2019s distribution of sympathy. Conflating the two characters means that the \nviewer\u2019s sympathy (with Mort) and antipathy (toward Shooter) is no longer \ndiscriminable by separate bodies. The corporeal body we have individuated as Mort \nthus plays host to a dynamic conflict of spectatorial emotions. In Fight Club, by \ncontrast, the narration retains visual purchase on Tyler even after his autonomy as a \nhuman agent is undermined. Maintaining Tyler\u2019s bodily integrity not only permits \nDavid Fincher to keep his star performer (Brad Pitt) on screen (compare the \nirreverence with which John Turturro is vanquished in Secret Window); it also allows \nhim to preserve the clarity of distinction between Tyler and The Narrator, \ntransparently marking out their position of conflict, and enabling a basically \nconventional battle of wits to usher in the denouement. Conversely, Secret Window \nfolds together its protagonists\u2019 discrete moral states, thus dissipating conflict and \ndislocating allegiance.  \n     The bodily unification of Shooter and Mort heads off any anticipation of a \nclimactic Manichaean struggle between the two characters. But the denouement also \ncloses down the prospect of an internal moral conflict, a gambit that would ameliorate \nthose negative traits of Mort\u2019s that the narration now lays bare. Hollywood cinema \noffers generic precedents for the interior Manichaean struggle, particularly in the \nhorror genre: think, for example, of the demonically possessed priest in The Exorcist \nIII (1990). By closing off generic options of this kind, however, Secret Window \nimplies that Mort\u2019s submission to Shooter is absolute and irreducible. (\u2018Mort\u2019s dead\u2019, \nthe schizoid protagonist drawls in Southern dialect near the climax.) If the \nManichaean tropes we expect to find are retarded, does the final act dispose of moral \nconflict altogether? (It does, after all, dispose of Shooter\u2019s bodily continuity and the \npersonality attributes we identify with Mort.) In fact, the locus of moral conflict is \n 13 \nresituated at the climax by pitting Shooter against Amy and Ted. Now the film \nreworks its pattern of allegiance so that the ensuing moral conflict achieves an \nambivalent, unsettling effect upon the spectator\u2019s sympathies. \n     Note that I have not called this final confrontation a Manichaean conflict. Even \nafter the twist reconfigures the moral status of each character, the viewer cannot \nunequivocally assume that anyone among the party embodies purely good or evil \nvalues. (It is, however, still a moral conflict, because Shooter\u2019s harmful intent is at \nodds with Amy and Ted\u2019s everyday values.) Part of our reluctance to ascribe absolute \nmoral states to the characters arises from our prior judgements of them. The \u2018primacy \neffect\u2019 (i.e. the first impressions that inform our evaluation of a character) thus reveals \nits particular potency in these moments. If the narration now asks us to re-evaluate \nAmy and Ted as basically good people, this judgement must be counterbalanced \nagainst our established archive of assumptions about the two characters. Since this \narchive includes a good many negative judgements, our response to Amy and Ted will \nmost probably be ambivalent at the film\u2019s climax. (Our reluctance to infer \nindomitable moral states may also reflect a recent wariness toward the film\u2019s narration \n\u2013 if the narration has misled us about an agent\u2019s moral status before, it may do so \nagain.) \n     Still more ambivalent is the spectator\u2019s engagement with Mort. At stake here is the \nfund of goodwill that the film has generated toward the protagonist. Are we inclined \nby the revelation \u2013 that is, by its moral revision to character \u2013 to \u2018disengage\u2019 our \nsympathy with Mort (assuming that such short-circuiting of emotional response is \npossible)? Certainly the surprise twist reveals our allegiance to have rested on some \nshaky assumptions. But the revelation does not so much arrest allegiance as attenuate \nit, and several factors ensure that our alliance with Mort prevails at the climax.  \n     For instance, the identity switch is unveiled late in the film, by which stage the \nviewer\u2019s allegiance with Mort is firmly established; it is no easy task, therefore, for \nthe late-arriving twist to sever this allegiance altogether. We can also understand the \nfilm\u2019s climax as satisfying the demands of a tacitly augured revenge plot. Early \nphases of action establish Mort as blighted, ineffectual, and tormented by his wife\u2019s \nadultery. Now culminating events empower him to mete out \u2018retribution.\u2019 From this \nperspective, Mort\u2019s revenge-taking becomes a desirable trope (though the extremity \nof his payback will most likely disconcert the viewer). Another probable factor \nshaping our allegiance at the climax is Depp\u2019s star presence. Here, star \u2018charisma\u2019 has \n 14 \na determinate mitigating effect upon undesirable character activity.\n18\n (Depp, in the \nview of one critic, \u2018takes the audience with him whether he\u2019s reaching for an evil-\nlooking poker or a cup of coffee\u2019 (Christopher, 2004).)  \n     Our enduring sympathy with Mort tinctures the film\u2019s denouement. The kernel of \nour allegiance with the character helps leaven the horror of the film\u2019s ending, and so \nmaintains the macabrely comic tone that characterises the film as a whole. There is no \ndenying, however, that our allegiance with Mort is radically altered by the film\u2019s \nrevelation: sympathy may comprise part of our amended judgement, but so too does \nsuspicion, distrust, and antipathy. Through all this, the dominant is the central hub \nthat transforms our allegiance. Action occurring early in the film sets out character \nflaws that will later be exposed on a far greater scale. These flaws are transmogrified \nby the main revelation, which modifies our evaluation not only of Mort, but virtually \nof the entire narrative populace. (Even minor characters, such as the town\u2019s \nineffectual sheriff and the smitten female postal worker, are tainted with a suspicion \nthat we must subsequently disqualify.) But the dominant in Secret Window motivates \nstill another substantive effect, one that pertains less immediately to story \ncomprehension and character engagement.   \n \nNarrational salience \nRevelation in the puzzle film not only reorders the viewer\u2019s sympathy; it also makes \nplot architecture highly salient. As we endeavour to adjust to its shifting pattern of \nallegiance, the film invites us to appreciate the dextrous use of cues and structures by \nwhich it has concealed the chief revelation. The film\u2019s formal design, then, is spotlit \nby the revelation sequence. Murray Smith has applied the phrase \u2018architectural \npleasure\u2019 specifically to parallelism and the American independent cinema, but we \ncan requisition it to broadly characterise the revelation\u2019s foregrounding of form.19 \nHere, delight is taken in repressive formal procedures. Puzzle films thus evince a kind \nof epistemic as well as architectural pleasure. A major part of their interest derives \nfrom an elaborate play with the viewer\u2019s knowledge.  \n     Now the narration reveals itself to be more repressive than we had thought. Errors \nof comprehension become palpably evident to the viewer. Flashbacks revive lines of \ndialogue that, in retrospect, seem to flirt precariously with disclosure of the main \ntwist. Even character names come to be seen as bits of foreshadowing. (In Secret \nWindow, Mort lives up to his name by at one stage splintering into several bodies.) As \n 15 \nthe revelation unfurls, the film makes its principles of construction maximally \ntransparent.\n20\n  \n     Revelation sequences also lay bare anticipated genre tropes. Generic expectations \nare never as acute as when they are retarded. Sometimes, the puzzle film overlaps two \nor more genres, the better to furnish unexpected events that can nonetheless be \nmotivated generically. This strategy is evident in Secret Window, which, though \novertly a horror-thriller hybrid, blends together strong elements of comedy and \nromance. It also animates a tacit detective schema. This schema is embodied not only \nby the film\u2019s repressive narration, but by Mort\u2019s effort to solve a disturbing enigma.  \n     Applying detective schemata to Secret Window finally obliges us to identify the \ndetective (Mort) as the criminal (Shooter), and vice versa.\n21\n Or we might say that the \nfilm intensifies a detective norm \u2013 namely, the close identification of detective and \ncriminal \u2013 so that the degree of interchangeability between the two figures becomes \n\u2018maximal.\u2019 From either angle, the film\u2019s generic strategies look fairly subversive of \ndetective convention. However, we form a different impression by mapping horror \nschemata onto the film. Whether the cause is possession (The Shining) or \nschizophrenia (Sisters, 1973), the pinpointing of evil within the protagonist is a \ncommon trope of the horror film. Explaining the revelation in terms of detective \nnorms thus risks distorting the film\u2019s adherence to genre conventions. What may \nstrike us as \u2018antigeneric\u2019 and surprising with respect to the detective film is quite \nconventional when set against horror schemata. By subduing detective schemata, \nSecret Window lets horror norms come forth with surprising effect. \n     Generic allusion also foregrounds a highly self-conscious narration. Secret \nWindow reminds us that the functions of allusionism can be effectively wide-ranging. \nAt times the film employs allusion \u2018postclassically\u2019, for purposes of homage.22 But \nreferences of this sort tend always to be mediated by a more \u2018immediate\u2019 narrative \npurpose. In Secret Window\u2019s revelation sequence, the inexplicable fissures that snake \nacross the cabin walls not only evoke similar imagery in Repulsion (1965) and The \nExorcist (1973), but also function subjectively (giving us Mort\u2019s aberrant POV) and \nmetaphorically (signifying the severity of his mental schism). Allusion will also \nfunction as narrative decoy. The grisly killing of Mort\u2019s pet animal in Secret Window \nrevives a favourite motif of the horror and thriller genres \u2013 recall, for example, the \nominous animal totems displayed in Straw Dogs (1973) and invoked in Cape Fear \n(1962, 1991). Traditionally, this motif asserts the potency of some external agent \n 16 \nthreatening the family (e.g. the Cornish farmhands; the aggrieved ex-con). Exploiting \nthis motivic connotation allows Secret Window to further misdirect the viewer, whose \nsuspicions should properly fall upon a figure located within the family itself.  \n     Lastly, allusion will reflect thematic concerns. In a riff on The Shining\u2019s \u2018Redrum\u2019 \nwordplay, Mort\u2019s spiralling delusions transmute a baleful proper name (\u2018Shooter\u2019) \ninto a murderous directive (\u2018Shoot Her\u2019). This allusive emphasis on renewed \nperception is apt for a film that thematises perceptual and cognitive misapprehension. \nIt also hints at Secret Window\u2019s broader strategies of narrative comprehension, which \nbind the viewer\u2019s perceptual and inferential activity on a rack of repressiveness, \nmisdirection, and unreliability.\n23\n  \n     Two more self-conscious tactics should be highlighted. First, several of our puzzle \nfilms call attention to narrative processes by making storytelling a thematic reference \npoint. Characters might reflect on the art of effective storytelling, as in The Sixth \nSense (\u2018You\u2019ve got to add some twists\u2019, one character instructs Malcolm). In The \nOthers, the traditional discourse of oral narrative propels the film\u2019s plot (\u2018Now \nchildren: are you sitting comfortably? Then I\u2019ll begin\u2019). Secret Window magnifies this \ntactic further, tailoring fiction-making and plagiarism into ostensible story materials. \nIn addition, reflexive dialogue focuses our attention onto particular aspects of the text, \nas when Mort proclaims in the film\u2019s coda: \u2018[the ending] is the most important part of \nthe story\u2026 this one is perfect.\u2019  \n     Secondly, Secret Window flags narrative procedures by baring the device of \nvoiceover. Mort\u2019s periodic narration functions in traditional ways, supplying \nsubjective data and soliciting the viewer\u2019s allegiance. Yet, as the main twist will \nreveal, interior monologue here exceeds its typical functions. Hindsight lets us \nperceive psychological cues hitchhiking on the voiceover device: Mort\u2019s \n\u2018disembodied\u2019 voice, we realise, has all along been evidence of a fractured \npsychology. By suppressing this psychological cue, Secret Window discourages us \nfrom probing the voiceover for deeper narrative significance.  \n     Mort\u2019s voiceover will reach a pitch of overtness just prior to the revelation. Here, \ndiegetic boundaries overlap as Mort begins interacting with his nondiegetic narration. \nPrima facie this gesture constitutes a stylistic flourish, but Secret Window\u2019s twist will \nuncover a narrative connotation as well. Engaging Mort in cross-diegetic dialogue \nserves retrospectively to signal his fast-unravelling psychosis. As so often in Secret \n 17 \nWindow, a bold or transgressive tactic turns out to be motivated by character traits and \nstory action. \n \nAny critic reproaching Secret Window for dramaturgical incompetence needs to \nacknowledge the ambitiousness of the film\u2019s narrative strategies. Moreover, part of \nthe film\u2019s interest lies in the imputed \u2018failure\u2019 of its revelation. From this, we can \ndiscern the rough limits of character revelation as they are tacitly defined in \ncontemporary Hollywood cinema. Tellingly, these parameters seem to stem from \nprinciples of classical filmmaking: the film\u2019s most problematic elements are those that \nappear to violate classical norms. Typically, however, the film\u2019s innovations are \ndiscreetly anchored in classical principles. Often, what looks like incompetent \nstorytelling is simply action that has been motivated obliquely. For example, story \naction will fulfil Mort\u2019s repressed goals, abandoning his explicitly-stated objectives; \ndetective schemata will be judiciously superseded by horror elements, which the \nnarration seeds throughout the foregoing action; and self-conscious voiceovers are \nretroactively justified by Mort\u2019s schizoid psychology. The critic indicting Secret \nWindow for inefficient storytelling fails to recognise either the film\u2019s aesthetic risk-\ntaking or its adherence to classical narrative principles. True to puzzle film tradition, \nSecret Window invites and rewards repeat viewings.  \n     I have tried to show that Secret Window\u2019s main twist importantly shapes many of \nthe film\u2019s \u2018difficult\u2019 functions and effects. Furthermore, what I have defined as the \nfilm\u2019s dominant assumes fairly complex activity on the part of the viewer. Secret \nWindow\u2019s revelation, we have seen, forces the viewer to reweigh her sympathy with \nthe dramatis personae. It wrenches the viewer\u2019s attention between story \ncomprehension and formal appreciation. It undercuts basic and \u2018automatic\u2019 \nassumptions, i.e. that distinct bodies signify distinct individuals. And it upsets learnt \nexpectations pertaining to character goals, character change (including moral flux), \nreliable protagonists, and genre tropes. Acknowledging the twist\u2019s cognitive demands \nallows us to refute claims that contemporary Hollywood films bear witness to \u2018the \ndemise of audience consciousness\u2019 (Dixon, 2001, p.363). Indeed, puzzle films in \nparticular are largely predicated on a challenge to narrative comprehension.  \n     If we want to better grasp the tacit rules governing \u2018successful\u2019 puzzle films (like \nThe Sixth Sense), we do well to dwell upon problematic examples of the genre. Such \nan undertaking contains a historical component, moreover: it can gesture toward what \n 18 \nis encouraged aesthetically at a given moment in history. Secret Window betokens the \nparameters of character revelation within a particular film type at a particular \nmoment. Its handling of norms not only lends the film an intrinsic formal interest, \ntherefore. It also elucidates the aesthetic principles upon which its more celebrated kin \nrely. \n \n \n  \n \nI would like to thank Warren Buckland, Fred Botting, and my anonymous reader for \ntheir insightful comments and suggestions.  \n \nNotes \n                                                          \n1\n Though recently flourishing, this preoccupation is not new to Hollywood. Popular \ncinema has a long history of films organised around a surprise twist. In terms of \ncharacterisation, the contemporary films I\u2019m referring to here extend and rework the \npsychological confusion associated with the New Hollywood antihero (just as that \narchetype reworked the psychological transparency of the classical hero). Like the \n1970s antihero, the current protagonist is vulnerable to deception, but now the deceit \nis self-perpetuated rather than attributable to a corrupt social epoch. \n2\n Critics find Hide and Seek\u2019s main twist equally problematic: \u2018\u2026this is a precisely \nengineered piece\u2026only letting itself down in its final act\u2019 (Davies, 2005); \u2018it\u2019s not \ntechnically true to say that the movie cheats, but let\u2019s say it abandons the truth and \ndepth of its earlier scenes\u2019 (Ebert, 2005); \u2018the ending\u2026is so abysmally lame and \nimplausible\u2019 (Arendt, 2005); \u2018when [the film] springs its Big Twist 80 minutes in, \nprior to the feeble climax, it\u2019s clear there really is nothing under the emperor\u2019s \nclothes\u2019 (Elley, 2005). \n3\n Extrinsic norms are those repeated standards or \u2018rules\u2019 by which typical or classical \nnarrative films operate. Intrinsic norms, by contrast, are rules that are set up by the \nindividual work, and which may (as in the case of the films we\u2019ll be considering) \nexplicitly violate extrinsic norms. \n4\n Considerations of space oblige me to restrict my analysis to Secret Window, but \nmany of the arguments I advance here are equally applicable to Hide and Seek. I will \ntry to flag any substantial dissimilarities between the two films at relevant junctures. \nA sketch of Hide and Seek\u2019s narrative will be useful at this point. A New York \n 19 \n                                                                                                                                                                      \npsychologist, David Callaway (Robert DeNiro), is distraught by the apparent suicide \nof his wife (Amy Irving). David relocates to the countryside with his young daughter, \nEmily (Dakota Fanning), who soon reports of encounters with an imaginary friend \nnamed Charlie. Shortly thereafter, the country house is assailed by \u2018disturbances\u2019: \ngraffiti is mysteriously scrawled on the bathroom walls; a pet cat is discovered \ndrowned in the bathtub. David attributes the incidents to Emily, who in turn diverts \nthe blame to Charlie. Things turn more sinister when a family friend (Elisabeth Shue) \nis thrown from Emily\u2019s bedroom window. Eventually an epiphany strikes David, as \nhe discovers that he has been repressing an alter ego: Charlie. Overwhelmed by his \ndiabolic persona, David\/Charlie tries to murder Emily but is shot dead by Katherine \n(Famke Jannsen), a colleague from New York. In the film\u2019s coda, Emily sketches a \npicture of herself, but the crayon drawing implies that David\u2019s schizophrenia has \nhereditary consequence: the self-portrait shows a two-headed child. \n5\n King\u2019s story \u2013 included in the anthology Four Past Midnight (Hodder and \nStoughton, 1990) \u2013 is entitled \u2018Secret Window, Secret Garden.\u2019 \n6\n In identifying the twist as the dominant, I run up against a dissenting voice within \nthe diegesis itself. Secret Window\u2019s blocked novelist proclaims: \u2018The only thing that \nmatters is the ending. It\u2019s the most important part of the story.\u2019 Mort\u2019s assertion may \nbe true of his own \u2018story\u2019 (which, admittedly, closely parallels that of Secret Window), \nbut it does not hold true of Secret Window itself. The film\u2019s coda cannot exist \nindependently of the twist; in other words, the revelation facilitates the ending. By \ncontrast, the revelation is not dependent upon the coda for its meaning, and a vast \nrange of alternative denouements could conceivably be yielded by the revelation. \n7\n King\u2019s novella can underscore this identity switch by titular sleight of hand: the \nnarration refers to Mort only as \u2018Shooter\u2019 once the main twist has been revealed. \n8\n Of course, there is another type of protagonist who actively assumes a distinct \nidentity, but Secret Window departs from this tradition of character as well. A handful \nof examples will suffice. In The Talented Mr Ripley (1999), Tom (Matt Damon) steals \nthe identity of Dickie to compensate for the amorphousness of his own identity. In \nThe Passenger (1975), David Locke (Jack Nicholson) inherits the shady existence of \na gun smuggler, so as to escape the trappings of his past. And in Superman: The \nMovie (1978), the Man of Steel (Christopher Reeve) manufactures the persona of \nClark Kent to patrol Metropolis undetected. Unlike each of these figures, Mort\u2019s \n 20 \n                                                                                                                                                                      \nadoption of a dual identity is not consciously motivated. In addition, Mort is totally \nconsumed by his alter ego in a way that these other protagonists are not. Though he \nmay want to, for example, Ripley is unable to fully relinquish his original identity, \nhowever tenuous it may be. \n9\n A relatively early precursor of our puzzle film trend is Alan Parker\u2019s Angel Heart \n(1987), a film which tailors its plot surprise to the thematic motifs (e.g. incest, flawed \nacts of detection) of such neo-noirs as Chinatown (1974). \n10\n Much the same can be said of Haute Tension (aka High Tension\/Switchblade \nRomance, 2003) which, though not a Hollywood film, is contemporaneous with the \ntrend I have been describing. Like our Hollywood examples, Haute Tension contrives \na narrative revelation hinged on a suppressed identity. However, the viewer\u2019s coming \ninto knowledge is not paralleled by the female protagonist\u2019s moment of \u2018awakening\u2019 \u2013 \nindeed, it is not clear that the character ever becomes properly cognizant of her split \npersonality. \n11\n A determinate outcome for the foremost goal is not furnished, for ambiguities still \nremain. Because Mort and Shooter are the same person, Mort effectively plagiarised \nhis own work. From another standpoint, no actual story authored by Shooter can exist, \nsince Shooter is not literally a person; thus Mort could not have plagiarised it. Or \nperhaps Mort did plagiarise the story from another, actual author, and his feelings of \nethical guilt simply manifest into the virtual figure of Shooter. Far from being \nresolved, then, Mort\u2019s primary goal is simply retarded by the narrative revelation. In \nany event, the twist reveals that the plagiarism story \u2013 the armature on which Mort\u2019s \nprincipal goal hangs \u2013 is a sheer plot device, akin to a Hitchcockian macguffin. \n12\n Hide and Seek circumvents this play with recognition by not specifying Charlie\u2019s \nphysical attributes. In this way, David can more easily assume Charlie\u2019s identity in \nthe mind of the viewer. \n13\n For a discussion of this tactic, see Buckland, 2001, p.33. \n14\n Film titles may also reflect this thematic preoccupation. The Sixth Sense, Hide and \nSeek, and Secret Window are titles which evoke unnatural, covert, or mediated \nperception. The Others is a more deceptive title, which compounds the film\u2019s red \nherring. It is a revelation of the self, rather than of or about others, that in this film \ntruly resolves the narrative enigma. \n 21 \n                                                                                                                                                                      \n15\n Examples of aural motifs of perception include iterated phrases or lines of dialogue \n(typically revolving around modes of \u2018seeing\u2019) and certain music cues (as in The \nOthers\u2019 appropriation of \u2018I Only Have Eyes For You\u2019). \n16\n Thanks to authorial license exercised in the adaptation stage, the causal nature of \nAmy\u2019s infidelity becomes salient in Secret Window. King\u2019s novella begins in medias \nres, depicting the first tense encounter between Shooter and Mort. Koepp\u2019s film also \nbegins in medias res, but prefaces King\u2019s opening with another moment of abrupt \nconflict: Mort confronts Amy and her lover in a motel room. By inaugurating his film \nwith a situation of marital collapse, and by trailing the event with a \u20186 months later\u2019 \ncaption, Koepp augments our sense that Amy\u2019s infidelity has determinate causal \ninfluence upon the narrative events that follow. The film thus implies her culpability \nin Mort\u2019s mental deterioration, though it will later mitigate her actions by itemising \nMort\u2019s negative traits (e.g. alcohol abuse) and Amy\u2019s own private trauma (she has \nmiscarried their child). That Amy\u2019s love affair triggers Mort\u2019s mental schism is \nimplied throughout the film. Several of Mort\u2019s subjective flashbacks, for instance, \nhark back to the opening motel confrontation. (Hide and Seek\u2019s protagonist is \nsimilarly beset by memories or fantasies of his wife\u2019s infidelity. Here, fragmentary \nsubjective flashbacks accumulate for communicative purpose, gradually orienting the \nspectator to previously withheld events and supplying motivation for David\u2019s acts of \nviolence.) \n17\n The term \u2018allegiance\u2019 is borrowed from Murray Smith, 1995. Smith employs the \nterm to denote the viewer\u2019s moral evaluation of a character, which serves as the \nmainspring of emotional response. \n18\n For the capacity of star charisma to influence allegiance, see Smith, 1995, pp.193-4. \n19\n This is not to deny, of course, that a puzzle film can also be an American \nindependent film. For more on \u2018architectural pleasure\u2019, see Smith, 2001, p.156. \n20\n Still, the narration is not \u2018parametric\u2019, or style-centred in Secret Window. As I have \nindicated, the revelation sequence places considerable demands on the viewer, not \nleast in respect of story comprehension and character allegiance. Rather, the film\u2019s \nbaring of narrational style operates concurrently and interconnectedly with its surprise \ndevelopments at the level of story. (For parametric narration, see Bordwell, 1985, \nChapter 12.) \n 22 \n                                                                                                                                                                      \n21\n Tzvetan Todorov points out that in detective fiction, the criminal is often a \npoliceman. Films like Otto Preminger\u2019s Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) situate \nthemselves within this literary tradition. But typically, such narratives cue us to the \ndetective\u2019s criminality early on, rather than revealing it as a narrative twist late in the \nfilm. See Todorov, 1977, p.50. \n22\n No\u00ebl Carroll provides some important insights into the prevalence of cinematic \nallusion in Carroll, 1982. \n23\n King\u2019s novella also acknowledges literary and filmic antecedents. Synthesising the \nnames of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s protagonists in The Talented Mr Ripley, King confers \nthe moniker Tom Greenleaf upon a minor character. The reference to Highsmith\u2019s \nnovel is apt, given King\u2019s themes of interchangeable and confused identities. \nHitchcock\u2019s Psycho is also referenced in King\u2019s novella. Another minor character, \nRichard Perkins Jr (named for Anthony Perkins) holds class at Bates College. Once \nmore, the allusion is apposite: Mort will be subjugated to a shadow identity just as \nNorman Bates will be overwhelmed and displaced by \u2018Mother.\u2019 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 23 \n                                                                                                                                                                      \n \nReferences \n \nArendt, P.
