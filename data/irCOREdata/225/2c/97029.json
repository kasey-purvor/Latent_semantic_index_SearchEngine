The oscillatory field\nconsists of the collective motion of spatially distributed intracellular biochemi-\ncal oscillators [3,21]. So far, these wave phenomena have been studied by using\noscillatory reaction-diffusion equations, but recent experimental results suggest\nthat the overall wave behaviour is strongly affected by the hydrodynamic flow\nof protoplasm [12]. To take this into account, a reaction-diffusion-advection\nmodel was recently proposed for the system and the arising wave behaviour\nwas analysed in [10,22]. The flow is protoplasmic streaming, which is derived\nfrom a biologically active process and said to be self-consistent [22]. Namely,\nthe flow is not constant but varies with respect to space and time, depending\non the state of the system. This is a difficulty and the reason why the wave\nbehaviour is not well understood.\n1.1 Biological background\nThe plasmodium is a large aggregate of protoplasm with sheet-like morphology\nand it shows rhythmic contraction everywhere within the organism. While\nthis cyclic contraction is coupled with oscillations of biochemical components\nincluding Ca2+, ATP, H+ and NADH, it produces motive force (hydrostatic\npressure) leading toprotoplasmic streaming [13,20,23\u201325]. The streamingdirec-\ntion is switched periodically back and forth, depending on the spatial difference\nof the contraction phase. For these reasons, it is necessary that the plasmodium\nis regarded as a coupled oscillator system with advection [10,22]. In fact, phase\nwaves of cellular rhythm are observed in the real organism, and play a sig-\nnificant role in regulating the mechanisms controlling chemotaxis, thermotaxis\nand phototaxis [7,8,11]. Although these tactic responses can be explained by\nthe nonlinear dynamics of the phase wave, these phase waves have so far been\nanalysed for a conventional oscillatory reaction-diffusion model, and the effect\nof the flow has been ignored for the sake of simplicity.\n1.2 Aims and outline\nWe begin by motivating our study with some examples of phase waves in\nPhysarum polycephalum. We show the spatio-temporal patterns of rhythmic\noscillation that arise in the organism under different external conditions. We\nthen move to take a more theoretical approach: studying, in general, the effects\nof self-consistent flow on the wave behaviour of oscillatory reaction-diffusion\nDispersion relation in oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems 747\na 10 min \nsp\nac\ne\ntime\nb\nFig. 1 Acceleration of phase waves in the actual organism. a Typical spatio-temporal pattern of\nrhythmic oscillation, measured by the conventional optical method [7], in a plasmodium extending\nfreely along a lane of agar gel, as shown on the left. In the figure, the organism, indicated by shad-\ning, moved downward as indicated by the double arrow. The phase of the oscillation was almost\nsynchronous through the width of the lane. We recorded the time series observed along a line in\nthe middle of the lane. The propagation speed of the wave was faster in the rear than in the frontal\ntip (the boundary between these two regions is indicated). The lower figure, drawn on an enlarged\ntime scale, shows more clearly the difference in propagation speed. b Slower wave propagation on\na nutrient-containing gel (below the arrows). In all figures, the vertical and horizontal directions\nindicate space and time, respectively. The oscillation phase of cell thickness was discretised into\ntwo states, increase (black) and decrease (white). Scale bar: 10min except for the enlarged figure\nof (a). The length of organism was 2\u20134 cm\nequations. We use numerical techniques to calculate the dispersion relation\nfor propagating waves, and analyse the effects of the flow on travelling plane\nwaves. Later we consider a more general setting: we derive an approxima-\ntion for the dynamics of phase waves arising in a generic reaction-diffusion-\nadvection model by means of a perturbation method. Finally we suggest\npossible physiological roles of the self-consistent flow in the Physarum\nplasmodium.\n2 Wave acceleration of real organism in relation to variations in protoplasmic\nstreaming\nFigure 1 shows a plasmodium extending freely along a lane of agar gel (see\nupper-left part of figure): as time progresses the plasmodium extends along the\nlane, from top to bottom (double arrow). The different parts of Fig. 1 show\nsome real patterns of rhythmic contraction in relation to changes in strength\nof protoplasmic shuttle streaming. In order to demonstrate the oscillations, the\nphase of cell thickness was discretised into two states: increasing (black) and\ndecreasing (white).\n748 H. Yamada et al.\nIn Fig. 1(a) we see that in the frontal tip of the freely extending organism\n(below an imaginary line connecting the two horizontal arrows), wave prop-\nagation is slower than in the rear part of the organism (above the imaginary\nline). This slow propagation arises as a result of changes in the protoplasmic\nflow rate: weaker in the frontal tip of the organism. The phenomenon can be\nobserved more clearly in chemotaxis of the organism, as shown in Fig. 1(b). On\nthe nutrient site (below the imaginary line connecting the arrows), the wave\nspeed is much slower: it is known that protoplasmic flow is weaker at nutrient-\nrich sites than at other sites (above the imaginary line). From these results, we\nconclude that wave propagation is accelerated by increased protoplasmic flow.\nThese findings motivate our study: we investigate the effects of flow on\nwave propagation rates in oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems, in order to\ndetermine whether protoplasmic streaming rates can affect the phase waves\nobserved in the plasmodium.\n3 Numerical calculation of the dispersion relation\nA recently proposed model for contraction dynamics of the Physarum plas-\nmodium is a system of reaction-diffusion equations with flow terms [4,10,22].\nTo numerically calculate a dispersion relation, we specify a conventional two-\nvariable model with self-consistent flow [22]:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+ w.\u2207u = f (u, v) + D\u22072u,\n(1)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= g(u, v),\nwhere u and v are chemical concentrations. Here, we assume that one meta-\nbolic chemical described by u flows with the endoplasmic streaming while the\nother chemical described by v is bound to ectoplasm. The quantity D is the\ndiffusion constant of the chemical u. The velocity of the self-consistent flow, w,\nis determined by the concentration of the metabolic chemical as\nw = q\u2207u, (2)\nwhere q is a (constant) parameter expressing the intensity of the flow.\nModel equations (1) and (2) take the form of a generalised reaction-\ndiffusion-advection model with self-consistent flow proposed in [22] but they\ncan be obtained by some simplification from a previously proposed model with\nthree components [10]. In the previous model, the variables u and v are chem-\nicals which display oscillatory behaviour in ectoplasm. While v is bound in the\nectoplasm, u is a free component which can interact with contractile proteins\nand exchanges with the same chemical in the flowing endoplasm (say z). The\ndynamics of z include an advection term which is dependent on u. Although\nthis exchange of u and z is not so fast, we assume, for the sake of simplicity,\nDispersion relation in oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems 749\n0 20 40 60 80\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\nCo\nnc\nen\ntra\ntio\nn\nTime\n(a) Concentration profiles\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\nv\nu\n(b) Phase diagram\nFig. 2 Numerical solution of the spatially homogeneous system (D,w = 0 in Eq.

Parameters\nare as follows: a = 0.1, b = 0.5, u(0) = 0.6, v(0) = 0.6 and both plots are shown for t \u2208 [0, 80]\nthat u is always similar to z and has an advection term in addition to its intrinsic\ndiffusion term. Our justification for this comes from the fact that we make the\nadvection coefficient, q, small enough. From this, Eq. (1) is obtained.\nThe reaction kinetics are chosen to exhibit a limit cycle oscillation. Here the\nfunctions f and g are taken to be the Schnakenberg (tri-molecular) reaction\nkinetics [9,18]:\nf (u, v) = a \u2212 u + u2v, g(u, v) = b \u2212 u2v, (3)\nwhere a and b are positive constants. Under spatially homogeneous conditions\n(D = 0 and w = 0), the system has a stable limit cycle for b \u2212 a > (a + b)3 [9].\nWe chose this reaction system because the shape of the limit cycle in the phase\nspace is similar to that of the calcium oscillation in the plasmodium, which is a\nstrong candidate for the primary chemical clock underlying the rhythmic activ-\nity. Figure 2 shows plots of the numerical solution of the spatially homogeneous\nsystem and clearly demonstrates the limit cycle kinetics.\nPlane wave solutions of the system given by Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) are of the form\nu(x, t) = U(\u03c9t \u2212 kx) and v(x, t) = V(\u03c9t \u2212 kx), (4)\nwhere \u03c9 is the wave frequency (so that the period T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9) and k is the wave\nnumber (so that the wave length \u03bb = 2\u03c0\/k). The propagation velocity can be\ncalculated as \u03be = \u03c9\/k.\nTo obtain the dispersion relation for travelling waves, we carried out numer-\nical calculations for Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) with the following procedure. We initiated a\npulse travelling on a ring (a one-dimensional region with the periodic bound-\nary conditions), and solved the system until the solution became periodic in\n750 H.

(1)\u2013(3). The numerical method is outlined in the\nAppendix. a shows the concentration profile for u over (x, t)-space while b shows the concentration\nprofile for v. Parameters are as follows: a = 0.1, b = 0.5, q = 1.0 and D = 1.0\ntime. After measuring the rotating period of the travelling pulse on the ring,\nwe repeated the calculation for rings of different lengths. Thus we obtained the\ndispersion relation for periodic wave trains with stable propagation.\nWe used the explicit an Euler method for the reaction terms, an upwind\ndifferencing method for the advection terms, and an implicit method for the\ndiffusion terms. A more detailed outline of the numerical calculations, includ-\ning the initial conditions and numerical discretisation employed, can be found\nin the Appendix. In our calculations, the parameter values were taken to be\na = 0.1, b = 0.5 and D = 1.0. To see if these results are typical of the behaviour\nof the system, we undertook an analytical investigation: it is time consuming to\ncarry out a detailed numerical investigation over a wide parameter space. The\nanalysis outlined in Sect. 4 will allow us to approximate the dispersion rela-\ntion by numerical calculation of just two integrals. In this way we can quickly\ninvestigate whether the behaviour observed with the parameter set of Fig. 3 is\nrepresentative of that observed for more general parameter choices.\nFigure 3 shows a plot of the numerical solution of Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) and clearly\ndemonstrates the periodic behaviour of u and v. Plane waves with a wave length\nof \u03bb = 25 (k \u2248 0.25) occur with a period of approximately T = 10 (\u03c9 \u2248 0.63).\nDispersion curves for the reaction-diffusion-advection system, given by\nEqs. (1)\u2013(3), are shown in Fig. 4 (wave number, k, against frequency, \u03c9) and\nFig. 5 (period, T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9, against velocity, \u03be = \u03c9\/k) for various values of the\nadvection constant, q. It can clearly be seen from the figures that variations in\nthe self-consistent flow have a pronounced effect on plane wave propagation,\nand that propagation behaviour depends on both the wavelength and on the\nsign of q.\nDispersion relation in oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems 751\n0.5\n0.52\n0.54\n0.56\n0.58\n0.6\n0.62\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35\nfre\nqu\nen\ncy\nwave number\nq = 0.0\nq = 1.0\nq = 2.0\n0.5\n0.55\n0.6\n0.65\n0.7\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35\nfre\nqu\nen\ncy\nwave number\nq = 0.0\nq = -0.5\nq = -1.0\ntrigger wave\nphase \nwave\ntrigger wave\nphase \nwave\nq>0\nq<0\nFig. 4 Dispersion curves obtained by numerical calculations for positive (upper panel) and nega-\ntive (lower panel) values of q.

These classifications\nhave been marked on both Figs. 4 and 5.\nIn both cases (q positive and negative), as q is increased (while thewave num-\nber, k, is kept constant) the oscillation frequency of phase waves, \u03c9, remains\nessentially constant (note that the plots of Fig. 4 are on different scales). How-\never, the change in frequency is marked for trigger waves. As q is increased,\nthe oscillation frequency of trigger waves decreases: the change in frequency\nis more significant for q < 0.

For negative values of q, the curves\nshow large convex regions in period corresponding to trigger waves\nthe flow is increased, opposite effects occur according to whether the flow is in\na positive or negative direction. For example, for trigger waves and q > 0, \u03c9\ndecreases as |q| increases, while for q < 0, \u03c9 increases as |q| increases.\nIn contrast we see that as q is increased (while the oscillation frequency,\n\u03c9, is kept constant) the wave number, k, of trigger waves increases. Again we\nnote that this results in opposing effects when considering the modulus (i.e. the\n\u2018strength\u2019) of the flow.\nDispersion relation in oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems 753\n3.1 Application to Physarum plasmodium\nIn the previous section, the parameter q, expressing the intensity of flow, was\nshown to be crucial to the rate of wave propagation. This was the coefficient\nthrough which the chemical oscillator was related to the motive force of proto-\nplasmic flow. Therefore, q is associated with the power which is produced by the\nmechano-chemical apparatus of actomyosin in the organism. A recent simula-\ntion for the rhythmic amoeboid movement in Physarum plasmodium claimed\nthat this type of parameter, which in that report was called the \u2018stiffness of\nectoplasmic gel\u2019, played a key role in determining the speed and stabilisation\nof wave propagation [4,19]. This also indicates that the coefficient of flow or\nstiffness is a key parameter for regulation of phase wave propagation.\nIn the actual case of the Physarum plasmodium q is positive, provided that\nthe contraction force is maximum when chemical concentration is minimum.\nSuch behaviour is observed for Ca2+, which is the most probable candidate for\na primary chemical clock in the plasmodium [10].\nHereafter, we will focus only on the phase wave which is characterised by\na low wave number, k, since only low wave numbers were observed in the\nactual organism. The results of this section show that self-consistent flow has\na number of profound effects on the phase waves, such as acceleration of the\nwave. This can be thought of as equivalent to elongation of the wavelength,\nsince the frequency of the phase waves remains almost unchanged. Clearly this\neffect has advantages for intracellular signal communication because physio-\nlogical information is encoded in the phase of oscillation [7,8]. By making use\nof the acceleration, the plasmodium can maintain a system as large as up to the\norder of a metre, for example, in spite of it being a unicellular organism with no\nnervous system.\n4 Derivation of phase dynamics and estimation of dispersion relation\nfor a generic model\nIn this section, we consider a general type of reaction-diffusion systemwith flow\nterms [22]:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+ M\u2207u.\u2207u = f(u) + D\u22072u, (5)\nwhere u is an N-component vector of chemical concentrations varying over\nspace, x, and time, t. The reaction kinetics, denoted by f, are of limit cycle type\nand the quantity D is a positive diagonal matrix of diffusion constants. The\nvelocity of chemical flow resulting from protoplasmic streaming is determined\nby the concentration of the chemicals as M\u2207u, where the tensor M represents\nadvection coefficients. To consider the effect of flow on the dispersion relation,\nwe derive the phase dynamics from Eq. (5), and estimate a dispersion relation\nfor the phase wave.\n754 H. Yamada et al.\nBy means of limit cycle perturbations, the dynamics of phase waves in\nstandard reaction-diffusion systems for oscillatorymedia are described byBurg-\ners equation [5,6,14\u201316]. We adopt a similar method for oscillatory reaction-\ndiffusion equations with this type of flow term.\nWe assume that the limit cycle is described by a solution of Eq. (5) under\nspatially homogeneous oscillation with frequency \u03c90:\nu = u0(\u03c4 ), \u03c4 = \u03c90t, (6)\nwhere u0 satisfies \u03c90u\u20320 = f(u0) and u0(\u03c4 + 2\u03c0) = u0(\u03c4 ). Since the system (5) is\ninvariant under time translation, it has a solution u = u0(\u03c4 + \u03c8) where \u03c8 is an\narbitrary constant.\nWe introduce multiple scales\nX = \u221a\bx, \u03c4 = \u03c90t, T = \bt, (7)\nand the asymptotic expansion,\nu = u0(\u03c4 + \u03c8) + \bu1(\u03c4 + \u03c8) + . . . , (8)\nwhere \b is a small parameter and \u03c8 = \u03c8(X,T). Substitution of Eqs. (7) and (8)\ninto Eq. (5) yields a hierarchy of linear equations for each order in \b:\n\u03c90\n\u2202u0\n\u2202\u03c4\n= f(u0), (9)\nLuj = bj, (10)\nwhere\nL = \u03c90 \u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2212 \u2202f\n\u2202u\n(u0). (11)\nHere bj denotes the inhomogeneous term of the jth order equation for j =\n1, 2, . . .. For the first order equation, the inhomogeneous term is\nb1 = \u2212\u2202u0\n\u2202T\n\u2212 M\u2207Xu0.\u2207Xu0 + D\u22072Xu0, (12)\n= \u2212u\u20320\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202T\n\u2212 Mu\u20320u\u20320|\u2207X\u03c8 |2 + Du\u2032\u20320|\u2207X\u03c8 |2 + Du\u20320\u22072X\u03c8 , (13)\nwhere \u2207X is the nabla operator with respect to the scaled coordinate X. Thus\nthe solvability condition for u1 gives the dynamics of the phase waves:\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202T\n= c1\u22072X\u03c8 + c2|\u2207X\u03c8 |2. (14)\nDispersion relation in oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems 755\nThe coefficients c1 and c2 are obtained from the relations,\ncj = \u3008v\n\u2020, vj\u3009\n\u3008v\u2020,u\u20320\u3009\n, (15)\nwhere\nv1 = Du\u20320, and v2 = Du\u2032\u20320 \u2212 Mu\u20320u\u20320. (16)\nHere\n\u3008v\u2020, v\u3009 =\n2\u03c0\u222b\n0\n(v\u2020, v)d\u03c4 , (17)\nand v\u2020 is the nontrivial periodic solution to the adjoint differential equation\nL\u2020v\u2020 = 0. Equation (14) describes slow modulation of the homogeneous oscil-\nlation with frequency \u03c90 by the phase \u03c8 . We note that the coefficient of the\nnonlinear term, c2, shows \u2018competition\u2019 between diffusion and flow.\nIn terms of the quantity \u03c6 = \u03c90t + \u03c8 , Eq. (14) becomes\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202t\n= \u03c90 + c1\u22072\u03c6 + c2|\u2207\u03c6|2. (18)\nThe dispersion relation is thus estimated from the phase Eq. (18) through the\nwave characteristics \u03c9 = \u2202\u03c6\/\u2202t and k = \u2207\u03c6 as [1,2]\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 + c2k2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (19)\nwhere k = |k|.\nSince the scaling of coordinates in the perturbation expansions (7) means a\nslow spatial modulation, k = O(\u221a\b), Eq. (19) is the Taylor expansion for the\ndispersion curve, \u03c9 = \u03c9(k), in the vicinity of k = 0. Thus, the coefficient of the\nnonlinear term in Eq. (18) is c2 = \u03c9\u2032\u2032(0)\/2. Here Eq. (19) has no linear term in k\nbecause of reflectional symmetry in the spatial part of Eq. (5). As shown above\nin Eq. (16), c2 depends on advection constants as well as diffusion constants.\nThe dispersion relation, Eq. (19), shows that the wave number, k, can de-\ncrease at a fixed value of the frequency \u03c9, as c2 varies, depending on the flow\nterm. But c2 also depends on the diffusion term and the concrete form of the\nfunction was given by Eq. (16).\nWe note that the dispersion relation, Eq. (19), is only applicable to periodic\nwaves with constant speed. It does not apply to waves with non-uniform phase\ngradients [17]. In such cases, we need to use the phase equation, Eq. (18), or\nanalyse Eq. (5) directly.\n4.1 Application to the Physarum plasmodium model\nWe now apply the results of this section to determine an approximate dispersion\nrelation for the model of Sect. 3. From Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) we see that the operator L\n756 H. Yamada et al.\nand its adjoint, L\u2020 are given by:\nL =\n(\n\u03c90\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2212 \u2202f\n\u2202u (u0, v0) \u2212 \u2202f\u2202v (u0, v0)\n\u2212 \u2202g\n\u2202u (u0, v0) \u03c90\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2212 \u2202g\n\u2202v (u0, v0)\n)\n, (20)\nand\nL\u2020 =\n(\u2212\u03c90 \u2202\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 \u2202f\u2202u (u0, v0) \u2212 \u2202g\u2202u (u0, v0)\n\u2212 \u2202f\n\u2202v (u0, v0) \u2212\u03c90 \u2202\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 \u2202g\u2202v (u0, v0)\n)\n. (21)\nThis results in the solvability condition of\n0 =\n2\u03c0\u222b\n0\nu\u20200\n[\n\u2212u\u20320\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202T\n\u2212 q(u\u20320)2|\u2207X\u03c8 |2 + Du\u2032\u20320|\u2207X\u03c8 |2 + Du\u20320|\u22072X\u03c8 |\n]\nd\u03c4\n+\n2\u03c0\u222b\n0\nv\u20200\n[\n\u2212v\u20320\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202T\n]\nd\u03c4 , (22)\nwhere u0, v0, u\n\u2020\n0 and v\n\u2020\n0 satisfy the equations\n\u03c90\n(\n\u2202u0\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202v0\n\u2202\u03c4\n)\n=\n(\nf (u0, v0)\ng(u0, v0)\n)\n, (23)\nand\n\u2212\u03c90\n\u239b\n\u239d\n\u2202u\u20200\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202v\u20200\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u239e\n\u23a0 =\n(\n\u2202f\n\u2202u (u0, v0)\n\u2202g\n\u2202u (u0, v0)\n\u2202f\n\u2202v (u0, v0)\n\u2202g\n\u2202v (u0, v0)\n)(\nu\u20200\nv\u20200\n)\n. (24)\nFrom this we have a dispersion relation of the form\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 + c2k2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (25)\nfor small k, where\nc2 =\n2\u03c0\u222b\n0\nu\u20200\n[\nDu\u2032\u20320 \u2212 q(u\u20320)2\n]\nd\u03c4\n\/ 2\u03c0\u222b\n0\n[\nu\u20320u\n\u2020\n0 + v\u20320v\u20200\n]\nd\u03c4 . (26)\nSince Eqs. (23) and (24) cannot be solved analytically, we employ numerical\ntechniques to gain an estimate of the coefficient c2 for varying values of the\nflow parameter, q. We solve the system of differential equations in Matlab and\nthen evaluate the integrals by employing the trapezoidal rule. The dispersion\nrelation for differing values of q is plotted in Fig. 6.\nDispersion relation in oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems 757\nFig. 6 Dependence of the\ndispersion relation upon the\nflow. Equations (23) and (24)\nwere solved numerically and\nthen the parameter c2 was\ncalculated for varying values\nof the flow parameter, q. As q\nis increased the frequency, \u03c9,\nincreases for fixed values of\nthe wave number, k. We note\nthat this is in agreement with\nnumerical simulations of the\nsystem shown in Figs. 4 and 5.\nParameters were as follows:\na = 0.18, b = 0.5 and D = 1.0\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15\n0.66\n0.68\n0.70\n0.72\n0.74\n0.76\n0.78\nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \n(\u03c9\n) \nWave number (k)\nDependence of the dispersion relation upon flow\n \n \nq=\u20135.0\nq=0.0\nq=5.0\nApplication of the method of Sect. 4 to the Physarum plasmodium model\nneatly demonstrates the competition between rates of diffusion, D, and advec-\ntion, q in determining the dispersion relation (see Eq. (26)). However, without\nthe aid of numerical tools, it is difficult to make remarks (either qualitative\nor quantitative) on the behaviour of c2 as D and q are varied. This is due to\nthe highly nonlinear nature of the problem: the effects of varying q and D will\ndepend specifically on the problem at hand.\n5 Conclusion\nWe began by motivating our theoretical studies with observations on wave\npropagation rates in the actual organism, Physarum plasmodium. From consid-\neration of the spatio-temporal patterns of rhythmic oscillation we inferred that\ndecreased protoplasmic flow results in a decrease in wave propagation speed.\nWe then studied the effects of self-consistent flow on the wave behaviour\nof the oscillatory reaction-diffusion model proposed for the Physarum plasmo-\ndium. We used numerical techniques to solve the system of Eqs. (1)\u2013(3), and\nthrough this obtained a dispersion relation for varying values of the flow rate,\nq, and wave number, k. The addition of self-consistent flow had a number of\nprofound effects on the phase waves, such as acceleration of the wave.We noted\nthat this is equivalent to elongation of the wavelength since the frequency of\nthe phase waves remained almost unchanged.\nThese theoretical results are in agreement with the inferences of Sect. 2\nregarding the actual organism: protoplasmic streaming was able to accelerate\nthe phase wave speed. As discussed in the text, it is clear this effect could\nprovide advantages for intracellular signal communication due to the fact that\nphysiological information is encoded in the phase of oscillation.\nTo consider the effect of flow on the dispersion relation in amore general set-\nting, we derived phase dynamics for a generic reaction-diffusion system, given\n758 H. Yamada et al.\nby Eq. (5) and used asymptotic techniques to derive an estimate of the disper-\nsion relation for phase waves. The dispersion relation, Eq. (19), showed that the\nwave number decreased at a fixed value of frequency as c2 varied depending\non the flow term. The flow effect on wave acceleration could be understood by\nthis generic relation. We concluded that the flow term was able to accelerate\nthe phase wave speed (similar to elongation of wavelength).\nAcknowledgments TN is supported by theGrant-in-Aid for ScientificResearch,No.15300098, the\nJapan Society for the Promotion of Science.

(3). The system was solved on the domain x \u2208 [0, \u03bb],\nwith periodic boundary conditions: u(0, t) = u(\u03bb, t), and similarly for v. The\ninitial conditions were taken in the form of a \u2018pulse\u2019:\nu(x, t) = 1\n2\n+ sin\n(\n2\u03c0x\n\u03bb\n)\n, (29)\nv(x, t) = 1\n2\n+ 9\n5\ncos\n(\n2\u03c0x\n\u03bb\n)\n. (30)\nThe system was discretised using the following methods: an explicit Euler\nmethod for the reaction terms; an upwind method for the advection term; a\nleapfrog method for the flow, w, and an implicit method for the diffusion terms.\nLettingUnj \u2248 u(xj, tn) andVnj \u2248 v(xj, tn), where xj+1\u2212xj = \u2206x and tn+1\u2212tn =\n\u2206t, results in the following discretised system:\nUn+1j \u2212 Unj\n\u2206t\n+q\n[\nUnj+1 \u2212 Unj\u22121\n2(\u2206x)\n][\nUnj+1 \u2212 Unj\n\u2206x\n]\n= f (Unj ,Vnj ) + D\n\u00d7\n\u23a1\n\u23a3U\nn+1\nj+1 \u2212 2Un+1j + Un+1j\u22121\n(\u2206x)2\n\u23a4\n\u23a6\nVn+1j \u2212 Vnj\n\u2206t\n= g(Unj ,Vnj ).
