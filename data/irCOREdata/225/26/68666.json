In this paper, we \nexplore the psychological paradoxes that function within climate change settings, with \nparticular attention devoted to the way that research and development reinforces these \nparadoxes by advocating for participatory forms of inquiry.

This interconnection between these policy and research settings, reflections \non paradox, and the experience of incorporating community psychology into the \nparadoxical settings of NRM and climate change are captured in this paper. \n \n \nKeywords: Climate change, paradoxes, natural resource management, methodology, \nabduction \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 3 \n \nChasing our tails: Psychological, institutional and societal paradoxes in natural \nresource management, sustainability, and climate change in Australia \n \n \n \nThe notion of psychological paradoxes has seen a re-emergence in recent \ntimes. The paradoxical nature of happiness (Martin, 2008); self-awareness and \nidentity (Mullen, Migdal, & Rozell, 2003); and organisational processes (Birnbaum, \n2008;  Fernandez-Alles, & Valle-Cabera, 2006) are examples of where the notion of \nparadox has been investigated. Psychological paradoxes have also been found in \ncommunity responses to environmental concerns. Syme, Nancarrow, and McCreddin \n(1999) reported consistent findings over seven studies of conflicting values regarding \nthe management of water resources, a sensitive issue in Australia which is the driest \ninhabited continent. They reported that the community could make complex \njudgements where community members felt competing concerns for individual rights \nto water and the need to protect the environment. We will explore the notions of \npsychological paradox in the context of climate change and natural resource \nmanagement at three levels of decision making: the community; organisational and \ninstitutional; and at a societal level.  \nThe basic premise of paradox is explored in psychological, organisational, and \npolitical literature. Paradox is a term used to describe conflicting demands, opposing \nperspectives, and illogical findings (Lewis, 2000). In describing paradoxes, Smith and \nBerg (1997) cited the exasperated comments of a Cretan named Epimenides who \nstated \u201cAll Cretans are liars!\u201d Paradox has been used in psychology as a way of \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 4 \nunderstanding organisational behaviour and conflict (Smith & Berg, 1997). \nUnderstanding paradox as a structural feature of organisational and community \nsettings is a useful tool for community psychologists and other professionals \nattempting to conceptualise the complexity of NRM systems (e.g., Browne, 2007; \nCortner & Moote, 1999; Moon & Lim, 2002; Smith, 2000; Svedin, O\u2019Riordan, & \nJordon, 2001; Welby & Gowan, 1998). Paradoxes in NRM settings appear to serve as \na set of boundaries which constrict or facilitate peoples\u2019 willingness to act (e.g., \nCleaver, 2001).  \nParadoxes are often complex and create conditions where conflicts between \nmotives or actions are not easily resolvable. Smith and Berg (1997) described this as \n\u201cstuckness\u201d. They alluded to one of these more complex paradoxes that is now known \nas the \u201cexistential paradox\u201d that was articulated by Kierkegaard. The foundation of \nthe paradox is the biblical story of Adam and Eve and their eviction from the Garden \nof Eden. Kierkegaard suggested that the eating of the apple was symbolic of the \ndawning of self-consciousness and the loss of innocence. Reflecting on the human \ncondition, humans became aware of their mortality and also their ability to project \nthemselves beyond the limitations of life dictated by death. The paradox is that life \nand death are intimately woven into people\u2019s lives; the goal of life is death. This \ntriggers, for some, a desire to retreat into the blissful ignorance of denial. For others it \nrequires faith in a God who will save them from ultimate death through the \ncontinuance of an immortal soul. At a fundamental level, one could argue that the \nincreasing awareness of a range of environmental issues including climate change \nimpacts has interwoven into its\u2019 discourse the characteristics of Kierkegaard\u2019s \nparadox. Gore (2006) adopted this perspective when he argued that responses to \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 5 \nclimate change tended to be either that of denial or the belief that a technological \n\u2018god\u2019 would solve the problems. \nThere is a paradoxical, but often unobserved, cycle of environmental \n\u201ctradeoffs\u201d between different environmental policy areas in Australia. This paradox \ncan be stated as follows: as the climate warms, rainfall decreases and evaporation also \nincreases resulting in a greater need for water to support agricultural production. This \nresults in the opening up of more agricultural land and developing alternative water \nsources that have a negative environmental impact. This leads to greater energy use \nand emissions which then impact negatively on climate change.  \nMany areas of Australia are also irreversibly saline, resulting in the clearing of \nhabitable land for agricultural expansion. The complexity and uncertainty that \ncharacterises systems such as those described above (e.g., Gunderson & Holling, \n2002) underpins the experience of paradox at all levels of environmental\/human \nsystems. The paradoxes expressed in these systems are also linked to issues such as \nthe nature of postmodern\/postcolonial research and policy, social justice, fairness, and \nother key community psychological concepts.   \n \nParadox at the Personal Level \n \nPersonal experiences of paradoxical settings are often described through \nconcepts such as conflict and descriptions of \u201cstuckness\u201d (e.g., Smith & Berg, 1997). \nOne of the primary examples of psychological paradox is the experiential aspects of \nbeing engaged in global climate change and other NRM strategies. These strategies \ncurrently focus policy on individualised approaches to sustainable energy and \nenvironmental behaviours and consumption. When contrasted to organisational and \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 6 \nsocietal levels of analysis, an analysis of psychological paradox and experiences of it \nbegin to gain more weight in terms of the way it reflects certain elements of social and \npolitical systems. Psychological paradoxes embedded in these environmental and \nclimate change systems that emerge under analysis (particularly when viewed \nholistically with other \u2018levels\u2019 of analysis) are often the experiential aspect of equity \nand social justice, economic choice and freedom, and the impact of lifestyle, \nbehavioural and other attitude change focused approaches. The conscious consumer is \n\u2018stuck\u2019 in a system of conflicting values that privileges both consumption and \nenvironmentalism.  \nAn example of a psychological paradox which reflects stuckness and conflict \nrelates to our observation and involvement in water supply and demand management \nresearch as a result of decreased water supplies in south-east Queensland, Australia. \nPurifying and recycling waste water in Queensland was initially suggested in two \nregions, the Sunshine Coast just north of Brisbane and Toowoomba, a rural city west \nof Brisbane. In both cases, resistance to the plans was organised by a community \ngroup calling themselves CADS (Community Against Drinking Sewerage). In both \ncases community reactions were negative enough to stop the plans. In Toowoomba \n(affectionately\/cynically coined by CADS as \u2018Poowoomba\u2019 during the campaign), a \nlocal referendum to approve water recycling was lost even though water scientists \nassured the community that the process was safe for a range of purposes including \ndrinking. Due to the severe water crisis in Queensland these communities needed \nalternative water supplies, but they were not willing to use recycled water. A number \nof people in these communities have indicated that the water shortage situation was \npartially due to the government\u2019s inadequate planning for water supplies in the face of \nincreasing population and demand. Part of the psychological conflict in this situation \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 7 \ncould be that a problem which was perceived as originating in government (lack of) \nplanning for increasing state population and increased demand in water supplies was \nsuggested as being resolved by a system perceived as compromising individuals.  \nAlthough we will not explore this issue in detail within this paper, these \npsychological paradoxes also exist and can be experienced at a \u2018global\u2019 level. Climate \nchange is a global problem, with many arguing that what is needed is a \u2018global \nsolution\u2019. These various global expressions of psychological paradox, particularly the \nway that as Western consumers \u2018our choice\u2019 as consumers is portrayed as supporting \na certain type of national\/international discourses of climate change will be discussed  \nfurther in the next section.  \n \nInstitutional and Organisational Paradox in NRM R&D \n \nAs mentioned, paradoxes can affect how organisations and institutions \nfunction. In Australia one example is that the institutions that supply water to the \ncities are often the organisations that are responsible for improving efficiency and \nreducing water usage. Australian state governments have wrestled with the inherent \nparadox that these water supply institutions want to sell more water to the community, \nto maximise financial returns for government, while at the same time try to reduce the \noveruse of water resources and facilitate more effective water demand management. \nThe paradox has been attempted to be addressed by separating the functions of water \nsupply and water use efficiency by creating separate state agencies.  \nParadoxes also emerge in research and policy settings through approaches that \ninclude and involve community participation and which reconfigure science towards \nengaged and participatory scientific inquiry (B\u00e4ckstrand, 2004). As discussed earlier, \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 8 \nsolutions to water management and global climate change involve solutions targeted \ntowards the individual, household and the community such as reducing and managing \ndemand. Therefore, participatory and collaborative approaches are being increasingly \nsupported and promoted by governments as appropriate strategies to catalyse change. \nApproaches that include \u2018context\u2019 and the community into research and policy \nframeworks (e.g., postmodern, poststructuralist, transdisciplinary, participatory \napproaches) consistently bring to the surface the underlying paradoxical structure of \nenvironmental policy and research settings. This underlying paradoxical structure may \nalso be observed and experienced by community psychologists working in \ninstitutional and organisational settings for climate change, particularly if an \ninconsistency between the forms of democracy supporting climate change solutions is \nobserved. Community psychology, historically, is more aligned with participatory \ndemocracy than the more commonly expressed neoliberal democracy. This may cause \nfeelings of stuckness, conflict and a range of other difficulties for those involved in \nthese settings. At a disciplinary level and within our organisations\/institutions we will \nneed to be aware of the potential experience of paradox and ways to overcome it. This \nwill be discussed over the next sections of the paper.  \nIn programs that focus on collaboration and integration of policy, scientific \nand community perspectives, a number of paradoxical elements can often be observed \nat an organisational level. For example, organisational paradoxes can be framed \nbetween issues such as flexibility and consistency, inclusiveness and accountability, \nexpert and open decision making, bureaucracy and responsiveness, conflict and \ncollaboration, centralisation and decentralisation, and ecological and human time \nframes (Cortner & Moote, 1999). Institutions and governments involved in NRM in \nAustralia currently are engaged in these contradictory discourses of \u2018sustainability\u2019 \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 9 \nthrough an approach that frames a dichotomy between personal control and \neconomy\/governance. \nThese organisational\/institutional paradoxes can be observed as the flux \nbetween different policy and governmental directives for both NRM and global \nclimate change. For example, in both NRM and climate change in Australia a cycling \nbetween centralisation and decentralisation as guiding political philosophy can be \nobserved. In relation to global climate change in Australia, centralisation occurs at \ntimes through the suggestion of nuclear power as a new \u2018green and clean\u2019 power \nsource, and national level incorporation of strategies such as carbon trading. However, \nthis alternatively swings between these centralised policy solutions for climate \nchange, to decentralised approaches which focus on individualised, lifestyle and \ntechnologically based choices for \u2018consumers\u2019. For example, hybrid cars, changing \nover to energy efficient lighting, turning off light and electrical sockets, and other \nhousehold solutions have been suggested as being able to effectively impact on \nclimate change. That is not to suggest that a range of \u2018centralised and decentralised\u2019 \nsolutions to climate change are not necessary. The issue to be highlighted here, \nhowever, is the way in which policy directives around climate change in Australia \nparadoxically alternate between a centralised and decentralised approach. This is \nsimilar to the issue discussed earlier in this section in relation to the supply of water \nand the management of demand for the same system. In Australia, frequent \ngovernmental structural changes that alternate the two paradoxical roles of supply \n(cost recovery) and demand between separate and connected departments reflects the \nlack of resolution of this institutional\/organisational paradox.    \nAt another level there are a number of issues that are observed in Australia\u2019s \napproach to climate change that bridge the societal and the organisational expression \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 10 \nof paradox. For example, the move to environmental sustainability and a greater focus \non climate change are strongly emerging from the first world. However, Australia is \nalso invested economically, politically and socially in minerals and other forms of \nmining expansion. Particularly in Western Australia, we have experienced an \n\u2018accelerated\u2019 form of minerals and resource development juggernaut, that only \nrecently begun to slow down since the downturn in the global economy in 2008. \nAustralia, as a resource rich nation, is supporting the economic paradox in the \nrelationships being established between developed and developing nations, where we \nare both encouraging these developing countries to (inequitably?) engage in \n\u2018sustainable development\u2019 and climate change initiatives, while developing those \nresources supplied by Australia into consumables.  \nAs of the beginning of 2009 solutions to the current global economic crisis in \nAustralia involve targeted and fiscally supported infrastructure and economic \ndevelopment. It appears that in periods of \u2018boom and bust\u2019, the development of \nAustralia as a nation is intrinsically linked with primary resources (such as mining) \nand \u2018development\u2019 (such as infrastructure, housing etc). Although this is embedded in \nan increasingly visible political discourse regarding the environment and a range of \nenvironmental crises including climate change, a fundamental paradox emerges \nregarding the relationship between economy, environment\/nature and democracy in \nAustralia. This reflection on Australia\u2019s economic paradox is connected to a deeper, \nmore covert societal paradox about the way that dual frameworks for democracy \ncurrently shape environmental and climate change research and policy.  \n \n \n \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 11 \nSocietal Paradox: The Paradox of Democracy \n \n  A major paradox for climate change is that in first world countries the \neconomy is dependant on energy production and supply, yet this dependence is \nfuelling and accelerating global warming. Often the nature of the societal paradox of \nNRM and climate change is lost in the politics of natural resource exploitation, and a \nsystem that relies on this exploitation to maintain economic growth. For example, just \nas the US government\u2019s environmental policies are affected by the powerful lobbying \nof energy interests (Flannery, 2005), Australian environmental policies have been \nlargely controlled by the coal industry and other energy industries (Hamilton, 2007). \nHamilton writes that the coal industry has such a powerful lobbying position that it \nhas boasted that it wrote the previous federal government\u2019s climate change policies. \nAside from the powerful impact of vested interests, there is the broader paradox in \nthat energy production is at the core of economic development and it is this increasing \nenergy production and consumption that has created and maintains global warming. \nThere is another level to this paradox in that economic development and population \ngrowth are based on economic worldviews that expansion of the economy has been \nessential for countries like Australia and the U.S. (Atkinson & Hamilton, 2003; \nHamilton & Quinn, 2005; Stern, 2005). In Australia the resultant global warming \nfrom the use of non-renewable fossil fuels is that the continent is drier and the \ncarrying capacity (the sustainable capacity of the land to support human and non-\nhuman life) is threatened.  \nParadox is something that can be directly experienced.  However, it can also \nbe observed outside of these tangible organisational, community and personal \nsettings. Paradox can be located in the contradictory and competing discourses that \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 12 \nshape and inform environmental and climate change research and policy. \nGovernmentality reflects the features of capitalist, neoliberal and globalised societies \nthat at once promote a certain type of contractual social, political, economic and \nenvironmental context, yet is increasingly applied through strategies such as \nparticipatory democracy, human rights, empowerment and citizen engagement. \nGlobal (western) society is currently characterised by dualisms between the various \nforms of democracy (Marcil-Lacoste, 1992). Theoretically these concepts and \nexpressions of paradox expressed through these dualistic forms of democracy can be \nrelated to theoretical issues currently being explored in community psychology. These \nparadoxical \u2018dualisms\u2019 could be as easily suggested to be an alternative expression of \nrelationships between concepts such as Gemeinschaft\/Gesellschaft (T\u00f6nnies, \n1887\/1957) and the Third Position (Bishop, Vicary & Browne, 2009; Newbrough, \n1995), The One and the Many (Adler & Gorman, 1952), and specifically related to \nR&D strategic\/top-down approaches versus \u2018grassroots\u2019 participatory approaches.  \nComplex social, political and environmental questions in NRM are framed \nfrom different \u2018oppositional\u2019 perspectives from these two conceptualisations of \ndemocracy. Resolution of stuckness and conflict between these perspectives is often \nattempted through various approaches to research and policy. For example, in NRM, \nattempts to bridge these dualistic perspectives take the form of finding \u2018common \nground\u2019 (e.g., Plumwood, 1991). However, Marcil-Lacoste (1992) in a discussion \nabout the relationships between the One and the Many in different historical \nexpressions of democracy, highlighted how, although not identified in practice, this \nduality may actually be more accurately represented as a plurality. That is, these \ndifferent forms of democracy are often represented as dualistic and any attempt within \npolicy or research to address these dualisms reinstates a fundamental societal paradox. \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 13 \nEach perspective is \u201cconceptualised within an epistemological and axiological \nmonism which \u2013 and here is the paradox \u2013 makes it inseparable from its opposite\u201d (p. \n132). Similarly, Mouffe (1992) suggested that this represents a conversation regarding \ndemocracy where \u201ctwo different languages in which to articulate our identity as \ncitizens are confronting each other\u201d (p. 226). These different representations of \ndemocracy are currently \u2018engaged\u2019 through various forms of R&D and policy to \naddress land and water management and climate change in a dialogue, which actually \nmakes them inseparable. By attempting to overcome psychological, institutional or \norganisational level paradox by trying to resolve only one conceptualisation of the \nproblem (e.g., addressing only the creation of improved water supply systems or only \nhousehold demand management) actually reinstates a broader societal level paradox. \nThis classification of opposing perspectives within NRM and ESD, are linked to this \nplurality paradox and what is framed as oppositional perspectives may in fact be \nconnected and inseparable parts of the same system.  \nAlthough a duality is actually assumed, as an example of these plural and \nintegrated concepts, Australian government and bureaucratic settings attempt to \ngovern the environment and people through the democratic processes as well as \nthrough \u2018macro level\u2019 polices reflecting ideologies such as neoliberalism, \nglobalisation, and capitalism. These approaches encourage individual competition and \nbidding for involvement in engaged NRM while promoting benefits such as \nindividualised, controlled forms of empowerment. Conflicts over different ways to \napproach NRM, ESD, water management and climate change reflects a \u2018clash of \ncivilisations\u2019, characterised by attempts to consolidate (politically) differences \nbetween fundamentally and diametrically opposing cultural and ideological positions \n(e.g., Caldera, 2004; Huntington, 1991). Currently ecologically based forms of \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 14 \ndemocracy attempt to empower citizens through participation and collaboration. \nHowever, paradoxically, at the same time these approaches are suggested in a social \nand political environment that encourages individualism and competitiveness, \nreflective of neoliberal capitalism. Community psychology, in casting a \nmethodological and theoretical \u2018eye\u2019 over the issues of climate change and NRM, \nneeds to be careful to not reinstate this fundamental paradox but to work towards \nsolutions that address paradoxes at all levels.  \n \nThe Implications of Paradox for Community Psychology Methodology and \nTheory to Address Climate Change \n \nOne paradox about paradoxes is that while the outcome may be stuckness, \nwhich implies slow or no change, it is the people faced with the paradox who are \nstuck and not necessarily other aspects of a given community or context. We now see \nthat some of the climate change predictions are occurring more rapidly than expected. \nParadox creates an inability to respond to change, even though climate change is \nthreatening the nature of our existence (Flannery, 2005; Gore, 2006). The \nenvironment is changing more rapidly than humans can adapt to change. In this \nsituation community psychology needs to change quickly also. Centrally, we need to \nbe players in social action, to take the role of facilitating the change processes. \nCommunity psychologists cannot take on the role of the dispassionate researcher, \nremoved from the very people they are working with. Partnership with community \nimplies changing our roles to recognise that we are players in a game in which we all \nwill lose.  \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 15 \nPolicy response will need to be rapid. Research to inform policy will also need \nto be rapid. This means that long-term and well executed research will not be \npossible. Research must be seen as part of the policy process and part of societal \nchange. Our assumptions, of what the nature of the community and society are, will \nneed to be reconceived, we will finally and necessarily need to be Model II learners \nand use \u2018double loop learning\u2019 (Argyris & Sch\u00f6n, 1978). Model II emphasize \nparticipation and sharing control, deemphasizing winning at all costs. As Argyris \n(1976) stated: \"Every significant Model II action is evaluated in terms of the degree to \nwhich it helps the individuals involved generate valid and useful information \n(including relevant feelings), solve the problem in a way that it remains solved, and \ndo so without reducing the present level of problem solving effectiveness\" (pp. 21-\n22). Argyris and Sch\u00f6n distinguish between single-loop and double-loop learning. In \nsingle-loop learning, people modify their actions according to the difference between \nexpected and obtained outcomes. In double-loop learning, the actors reflect on the \nvalues, assumptions and policies that led to the actions in the first place; if they are \nable to recognize and modify those then double-loop learning has taken place. While \nArgyris and Sch\u00f6n were concerned with organizational level learning (and the validity \nof the approach has been criticised, Lipshitz, 2000), the concepts are very useful at the \nresearcher and practitioner level. This reflective process means that the nature of the \nproblem, as well as solutions are examined and developed. \nThe nature of the reflective research data and conclusions will be less \ninternally valid than is traditionally afforded by laboratory research. More \u2018weak\u2019 \nknowledge claims will be made as we do not have the time as researchers to spend \ngetting longer term \u2018strong\u2019 knowledge claims. Knowledge claims will need to be \nstrengthened by using contextual information and multidisciplinary knowledge to \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 16 \nbolster conclusions. In developing a picture of the complex environment, a series of \nsmaller research projects are needed that build on each other. The notion that it is \npossible to conduct a large scale study that has definitive answers is misguided as this \nreflects reductionistic thinking. Reductionist thinking, in this domain, is unhelpful as \nit assumes that aspects of context can be held constant while a specific hypothesis is \ntested. The nature of complexity is such that it is not possible to pin some aspects \ndown. The strength in research outcomes will require triangulation of findings so that \nexternal validation is determined, not by any one research outcome, but by developing \nconsensus between diverse research findings and researchers. This will mean that \ncommunity psychologists will have to let the nature of the social problems associated \nwith mitigation and adaptation to climate change dictate the nature of our research. \nWe will need to open up the discipline to others to work in partnership.   \nResearch will become more speculative and our research process will need to \nbe based on what Peirce (1955) called \u2018abduction\u2019, where knowledge claims are based \non logical analysis of weak claims. This will require what Polkinghorne (1983) called \nassertoric knowledge. We need to recognise that \u2018limited research\u2019 is better than no \nresearch, and that community psychological input may be required where there is not \nthe research to back up our speculations. Again, a social voice based on speculation or \nintuition serves the state and the world better than no voice. We need to frame our \nscience in terms of the questions that need to be asked, rather than in terms of the \n\u2018scientific merit\u2019 or status earned by the researchers. This requires working at the \n\u2018coal face\u2019, an unfortunate term, in this context! By this we mean that although \ncommunity psychology has many of the methodological and theoretical skills \nnecessary to address the issues of climate change, will need to develop new and \ncontextually responsive research designs.  \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 17 \nThe complexity of the issues surrounding climate change means that definitive \nanswers are not possible as the eco system is too complex. Dealing with how we ask \nquestions is as important as the questions we and others ask. Unfettered questions are \ndriven by unexamined worldviews. A role for the community psychologists is to use a \nworldview analysis of policy and research. Community psychology has recognised \nthe importance of power (e.g., Nelson & Prilleltensky, 2005), and thus the importance \nof governance, politics and policy. Worldview analysis based on the ethical \nunderstanding inherent in community psychology can provide a structure to ensure we \nask the best questions. The social justice framework of community psychology \nevident from its inception (e.g., Nelson & Prilleltensky, 2005; Rappaport, 1977; Reiff, \n1968) offers opportunities to analyse who has stood to gain from the emission of \ngreenhouse gases, who has paid the price, how we will deal with those who are \nvictims of global warming, and how can their voices be heard and their plight \nrecognized. The paradox of the assumption that the world needs economic \ndevelopment and expansion with little thought for the environmental and social costs \nneeds to be questioned. This requires that the notions of democracy need exploration \nas part of the research process.  \nThe ideals of democracy functioning within dominant neoliberal, capitalist and \nneoliberal world environments, create and form approaches that bring together \ncitizens and scientific\/policy experts in a way that still privileges expert frameworks \nfor understanding, but attempts to create settings where communities are transformed \nby engagement. There is a paradoxical conflict of balancing these different positions \nof community, layperson or citizen, and the \u201cexpert\u201d. The challenges that this brings \nfor community psychologists attempting to explore (and encourage) community \nengagement with environmental research and policy, and specifically climate change, \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 18 \nwill underpin the discussion in this section. There is a need to adopt methodological \napproaches within community psychology that allow us to observe, and effectively to \nwork toward creating change to, the paradoxes that emerge in these complex settings.  \nCommunity psychology is already at the forefront of adopting \nmultidisciplinary and transdisciplinary perspectives (e.g., Reich & Reich, 2006) that \nare necessary for addressing these complex issues. These perspectives are \nincreasingly being used by community psychologists working in environmental \narenas in Australia and the U.S. (e.g., Bennett, 2005; Browne, Bishop, Bellamy & \nDzidic, 2004; Browne & Bishop, 2007). We need to be cautious and adopt critical, \niterative and reflexive methods (e.g., Bishop, Sonn, Drew & Contos, 2002; Dokecki, \n1992; Lawson, 1985) so we do not re-embed the discipline or the communities that \nwe are working with back into the paradoxical experience of these environmental \nsettings. Within this we must recognise that that transdisciplinarity involves adopting \na scientific approach to analyse and inform complex social and environmental \nsettings, and therefore, has the ability to reinscribe the \u2018expert\/community\u2019 dichotomy \nas does other forms of research practice.   \nCommunity psychology\u2019s strong connection with contextualism (e.g., Payne, \n1996; Pepper, 1942) will provide a good background for exploring the issues of \nparadox and complexity that emerge in environmental and climate change research \nand policy settings (e.g., Browne, 2007). Also, our strong history of theory and \npractice with being translators (e.g., Freire, 1972), advisor (e.g., Minson, 1998), \nborder crosser (e.g., Sarason & Lorentz, 1998), active mediator, and other direct roles \nin involving the community, can be used to effectively create connections between \npolicy, science and the community involved in global climate change (Fischer, 2000).  \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 19 \nWhat community psychology needs to develop however, is a stronger, and \nmore \u2018multidisciplinary\u2019 approach to contextualism, and one that is not, \nfundamentally, modernistic (Newbrough, 1995). Although as a discipline our \napproach to contextualism is relatively strong, there are other disciplines that also \nhave been developing and refining alternative forms of contextualism that may well \ninform our theory, methods and practice (e.g., human geography, political ecology, \nand sociology). This is particularly necessary as currently the \u2018macro\u2019 level \nphenomenon such as the neoliberal democracy\/participatory democracy \u2018dualism\u2019 is \nnot easily expressed through community psychological contextualism or community \npsychologically disciplined \u2018language\u2019 (Browne, 2007). Therefore, while developing \nour own theory and methodology to effectively address climate change we will need \nto work with other disciplinary perspectives that more effectively address complexity \nand paradox (e.g., Kendall & Wickham, 1999). \n \nConclusion \n \nIn this paper we introduced how the concept of paradox can be used to \nunderstand some of the challenges community psychologists and others operating in \nclimate change settings may face. We discussed this at the personal, the \norganisational\/institutional and societal levels. We showed how individuals and \ncommunities can easily get stuck if paradoxes are not identified and overcome. \nIdentifying solutions for climate change involves recognising that there are \nfundamental paradoxes embedded in the solutions as they often conflict with current \ndominant ideologies of the (neoliberal) economy and \u2018capitalistic\u2019 democracy. \nIdentifying solutions to climate change involves addressing fundamental paradoxes at \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 20 \nmultiple scales, and recognising the way in which individual and organisation \nstuckness is embedded in the contexts of, and intersections between, economy, nature \nand democracy. A move away from understandings of solutions to climate change \nbased on dichotomies to pluralistic approaches is both appropriate and necessary.   \nThe threat of getting \u2018stuck in a paradox\u2019 as researchers has direct \nconsequences for community psychology. We discussed the implications of this for \ncommunity psychology including the necessity to more authentically adopt \nmultidisciplinary and transdisciplinary perspectives, and to embed practice and \nresearch in a rigorous process of critical self-reflection. These processes are important \nso the discipline, or the communities that we are working with regarding climate \nchange, are not re-embedded into these multiple scales of paradox. By effectively \naddressing the complexities and multiple scales of paradoxes when addressing climate \nchange scenarios, community psychology will be able to positively engage with, and \ninfluence, issues of sustainability and climate change in research, community and \npolicy settings.  \n \nChasing our tails: paradoxes of climate change 21 \nReferences \n \n \nAdler, M.J., & Gorman, W.
