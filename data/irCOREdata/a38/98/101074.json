Hargreaves argued that in medicine, \nprofessional decisions, such as which treatment to prescribe for a particular condition, are \nbased on the best available research evidence.  This ensures that patients receive the most \nappropriate treatment, with the greatest likelihood of success. \n \nIn contrast, teachers rarely utilise research in their decisions about what is best for their \npupils.  Hargreaves suggested that teaching could become an evidence-based profession \nif educational researchers were made more accountable to teachers.  This could be \nachieved through a coordinated approach to research, which would target research on \nwhat really counts (especially pedagogy).  He also called for more energy to be devoted \nto disseminating research findings more effectively.  \n \n 3\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nIn 2001, the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) began work on a \nresearch project designed to illuminate some of these issues.  The research formed part of \nthe Local Government Association (LGA) research programme.  The project began with \na review of the available literature, which was designed to inform the project\u2019s \nsubsequent empirical research.  This article outlines the approach and findings from the \nliterature review. \n \nThe review set out to answer the following questions about research utilisation and the \ndissemination of findings:  \n\u2022 How do local authority officers, heads and teachers use research findings for school \nimprovement? \n\u2022 Which features of research encourage teachers to use research findings in their own \npractice? \n\u2022 What role do opinion-leaders, diffusion networks and change agents play in the \ndissemination and adoption of ideas for school improvement? \nOne further research question was added at a later stage (see below). \n \nAbout systematic review \nA systematic approach to literature review attempts to identify the best available evidence \nto answer specific questions.  Such an approach prioritises evidence from empirical \nstudies that have the most appropriate design and are of the highest quality.  Systematic \nreview has its origins in the medical field and has been developed through the Cochrane \nCollaboration (Sheldon & Chalmers, 1994; Booth, 2001).  Recently, some of the features \n 4\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nof this approach have been adopted in the social sciences, including education (e.g. \nEvidence for Policy and Practice Information Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre)).  \nEvans & Benefield (2001) have identified some of the key features of a systematic review \nwithin education.  The approach adopted for this review set out to:  \n\u2022 address explicit research questions  \n\u2022 document the methods used for literature searching \n\u2022 carry out exhaustive searches  \n\u2022 establish explicit criteria for assessing the quality of studies \n\u2022 establish explicit criteria for including or excluding studies, based on the scope of \nthe review \n\u2022 adopt a consistent approach to combining information across different studies \n\u2022 produce a clear statement of the findings of the review.  \n \nMethodology \nThe systematic approach entailed extensive searches of relevant education and medical  \ndatabases, namely: AEI; BEI; BOPCAS; CERUK database; ERIC; PSYCINFO; \nMedLine; Web of Science and the NFER Library\u2019s own bibliographic databases.  Hand \nsearches, and internet searches were also carried out.  The searches were extended \nbeyond education to include medicine for three reasons.  First, because Hargreaves \n(1996b) had drawn comparisons between the teaching and medical professions, it seemed \nappropriate to consider empirical studies on research utilisation from the medical field.  \nSecond, it was anticipated that research utilisation would be a well-established research \ntopic in the field of medicine, and that searches in this field would add useful information \n 5\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nto the potentially smaller pool of studies that would be found in education alone.  Third, \ninitial searches identified three studies that set out to compare the behaviour and attitudes \nof different professional groups, including professionals in education alongside those in \nmedicine and other fields (e.g. Beard & Williams 1992; Latham, 1993; Hannan et al., \n2000).  The decision to include studies from the medical field enabled the review to \naddress a further research question: \n\u2022 Do medical practitioners make greater use of research findings than heads and \nteachers and if so, why? \n    \nSearches of electronic and on-line databases using thesaurus search terms were carried \nout and tracked during the search process. The intention was to ensure that, as far as \npossible, all literature in the field was identified, while keeping the focus on literature of \ngreatest pertinence to the research questions.   \n \nThe search was limited to publications between 1988 (the year of the Education Reform \nAct) and 2001.  This starting date was chosen because 1988 marked a major change in \nthe educational landscape of England and Wales, particularly in respect of the relative \npower and responsibilities of local authorities and schools.  The review considered \nEnglish language reports from the UK and in other countries, including the United States \n(US), Canada, Australia and Europe.  Published journal articles and unpublished \nconference papers reporting on empirical research from the fields of education, nursing \nand medicine were included, but theses were excluded.   \n \n 6\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nThe searches for the review of literature resulted in 183 papers (empirical, theoretical and \nopinion papers) being selected for further scrutiny from over 5,000 citations.  All \nsearches were documented and requests for literature (including those identified from \ncitations in articles) were tracked using a database.  As each publication was received, it \nwas scrutinised for its pertinence to the remit of the review.  \n \nAfter strict application of the search parameters, 21 empirical research publications \n(articles, papers, and books) were selected for detailed study.  In addition, the review \nincluded one influential theoretical publication pertinent to the research objectives \n(Rogers, 1995) which drew on a wide range of empirical research studies carried out by \nthe author and others.  Non-research papers were considered separately.  Their main \ncontentions were documented in order to consider the prevailing arguments in relation to \nthe evidence base. \n \nEach piece of empirical research was subjected to a thorough review, using a standard \nframework to extract key information about the purpose, design, sample, methodology, \nfindings and implications of the study.  The work was carried out by the main author of \nthis paper, but the two authors independently reviewed the first piece in order to establish \na common understanding of the precise nature of the information required and to provide \nconsistency of approach for later analysis.       \n \nThe summaries of each study were then analysed to build up an evidence-base in relation \nto each of the review questions.  In doing so, the researchers used a best evidence \n 7\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \napproach, prioritising the findings from the best designed and most authoritative studies \n(Slavin, 1986).  Criteria used to determine the priority accorded to research findings \nincluded: the pertinence of the research to the review; the appropriateness of the study \ndesign to address each of the review questions; the quality of the research in terms of its \ndesign, conduct and reporting; and the reviewer\u2019s judgement of the validity, reliability \nand generalisability of the findings.   \n \nHow local authority officers, heads and teachers use research \nfindings for school improvement \nThe review identified few empirical studies focusing on the use of research findings for \nschool improvement.  However, there were a small number of studies that investigated \nrelated areas, and the main findings are presented below. \n \nLocal authority officers\u2019 role in the use of research and performance data \nThe literature searches were unable to identify any empirical studies that concentrated \nspecifically on how local authorities officers use research findings for school \nimprovement.  Nevertheless, local authorities are involved in a range of school \nimprovement initiatives (DfEE, 2001), and a number of empirical studies have \nconsidered the use of pupil performance data for this purpose (e.g. Hendy, 1999; Lee & \nScanlon, 1999; Saunders & Rudd, 1999; Demie, 2001; Pavlou & Bennett, 2001; Rudd & \nDavies, 2002).  The main findings from these studies indicated that the majority of LEAs \nnow have an identifiable unit to undertake research and statistical data collection.  \nHowever, there are conceptual, statistical and ethical challenges associated with data use, \n 8\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nespecially when data are used to measure school performance and school improvement \n(Saunders & Rudd, 1999). \n \nUse of research findings by headteachers and school principals \nThe searches identified two research papers (Saha et al., 1995; Biddle & Saha, 2000), \nreporting on a study undertaken in 1991, on the awareness and use of research findings \nby school principals (headteachers) in America and Australia.   The key issues addressed \nwere whether principals believed that research had any value in their day-to-day \ndecisions and which factors might explain their attitudes to the value of educational \nresearch knowledge.   \n \nThe authors provide qualitative and quantitative data to support their claim that principals \nheld a generally positive view of research, and tended to use research in their decision-\nmaking.  They described the \u2018typical\u2019 principal in the study as judging research \nknowledge to be valuable.  Principals considered themselves to be regular, thoughtful \nusers of research knowledge and stated that they learned from that knowledge.  The \n\u2018typical\u2019 principal also argued that although research knowledge may be flawed, they \nbelieved it to be relevant.  Nevertheless, the authors suggest that although principals\u2019 \nresearch knowledge was broad, it was shallow.  They conclude that post-graduate training \ncontributed towards raising a principal\u2019s regard for educational research knowledge even \nthough he or she might consider such research to be problematic.  \n 9\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nUse of research findings by teachers \nAs a result of the search, four empirical studies were identified that focused on teachers\u2019 \nawareness and understanding of research literature (Latham, 1993; Zeuli & Tiezzi, 1993; \nZeuli, 1994; Shkedi, 1998; Hannan et al., 2000).   \n \nThe most pertinent evidence for this review is provided by Zeuli (1994).  This empirical \nstudy specifically concentrated on the way teachers use research findings.  The study was \ncarried out in Michigan in the United States with a convenience sample of thirteen \nprimary, middle and secondary school teachers, and aimed to find out how teachers read \nand respond to educational research.   The researcher provides a summary of teachers\u2019 \nself-descriptions of how they read research, and how they believe their research \nknowledge influenced their teaching.   Teachers were given the research articles, and a \nlist of questions they would be asked, during the interview (i.e. teachers had not read the \nresearch articles in advance).   \n  \nZeuli (1994) argues that teachers only consider an article or find it credible when it \nmatches their personal experience.  The researcher found that some teachers believed \nresearch should exclusively identify strategies and techniques that could have a direct \nimpact on their teaching, and these teachers judged the study\u2019s merits on the basis of \nwhether the findings can be translated into procedures that work in classrooms.  Other \nteachers believed that research could have an indirect impact on their teaching and had \nthe potential to expand their understanding of teaching.  These teachers were concerned \nwith the concepts and the claims the authors proposed, and how each study\u2019s conclusions \n 10\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nwere supported by evidence.  Zeuli argues, however, that most of the teachers responded \nmore positively to credible concrete cases or examples, and teachers needed more \nsustained opportunities to link their understanding of research to their knowledge of \nteaching.  \n \nFeatures of research that encourage teachers to use the findings \nin their own practice \nThe searches identified a number of opinion and discussion papers that raise issues about \nthe impact of educational research on practice (Shavelson, 1988; Shavelson & Berliner, \n1988; Bracey, 1989; Biddle, 1996; Budge, 1996; Hargreaves, 1996a; Scheerens & \nCreemers, 1996; Hegarty, 1997; Kennedy, 1997; Hargreaves, 1999; Blunkett, 2000; \nCounsell et al., 2000; Davies, 2000; Edwards, 2000; Hagger & McIntyre, 2000; \nMortimore, 2000).  These papers concentrated on the extent to which educational \nresearch contributes to practice, what research is expected to achieve and how researchers \nmight help teachers to make use of research.  In general, authors put forward the view \nthat there is a need for better professional knowledge about the management of schools, \nand effective teaching and learning (e.g. Biddle, 1996; Hargreaves, 1996b; Hagger & \nMcIntyre, 2000) and there is a lack of good, well-founded research evidence into key \npolicy issues (Bracey, 1989; Hargreaves, 1996b, 1999; Blunkett, 2000; Edwards, 2000).  \n \nThe subject of facilitators (and barriers) to the use of research has also been the focus of \nmuch speculation and discussion in education (see for example: Fleming, 1988; Tobin, \n1988; Rauch, 1991; Bassey, 1992; Turnbull, 1992; Malouf & Schiller, 1995; MacColl & \n 11\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nWhite, 1996; Staller & Kirk, 1998; Desforges, 2000a and b; Landry et al., 2000; Tierney, \n2000).   Authors of opinion pieces suggest that research can have an impact on practice as \nlong as teachers are involved in the identification of problems and are provided with the \ncontext in which they can learn the strategies for improvement.  Authors recommend that: \nresearch findings should be more accessible; the reward structures should be re-framed \n(i.e. academics should be rewarded for dissemination to practitioners); alternative \npublishing venues should be developed to target users; and academic jargon should be \nreduced.  Authors of opinion papers frequently argue that teachers and policy-makers do \nlearn from research but research utilisation works best in settings of collaboration and \nmutual support.  They conclude that effective programmes for change should be \nutilitarian, inspirational, provide immediate payoffs and meet local needs.  \n \nThe searches also revealed a number of discussion and opinion papers relating to the \nsubject of evidence-based practice (Marchant, 1988; Valencia & Killon, 1989; Foster, \n1997; Sackett et al., 1997; Murray, 1998; Cordingley, 1999a and b; Davies, 1999; \nPeersman et al., 1999; Cordingley, 2000, 2001; Davies et al., 2000; Groundwater-Smith, \n2000; Nutley & Webb, 2000;  Hammersley, 2001; Teacher Training Agency, 2001; \nNutley et al.,  2002), the value of action research (e.g. Elliott, 1994; Hancock, 1997; \nMeerah et al., 2001) or teachers\u2019 involvement in research (e.g Vulliamy & Webb, 1992; \nKershner et al., 1998; Halsall et al., 1998).  For example, Cordingley (2000) argues for \nteachers to be involved in research and also speculates about features of research that \nmight help teachers to access and make greater use of research findings.   \n \n 12\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nWhile the subject of practitioners\u2019 use of research has attracted considerable debate, there \nis limited empirical evidence on this subject, although Datnow (2000) used 22 case \nstudies to examine how and why schools in Canada adopted policy driven reforms, and \nthe consequences of these processes for the management of change.   \n \nBarriers and facilitators to using research in education \nThe searches identified three empirical studies that focused on factors that hinder or \nfacilitate the use of research by teachers (Castle, 1988; Cousins & Leithwood, 1993; \nShkedi, 1998).  Castle (1988) conducted a qualitative study with 26 elementary, junior, \nmiddle and senior high schools from one state in the United States, all of which were \ninvolved in a school reform initiative.  The findings suggested that the volume, lack of \napplicability and ambiguity of research material were barriers to the use of research by \nteachers.  Facilitators included: making information readily available; enabling teachers \nto devote time to reading research; use of outside consultants; providing evidence of the \nbenefits of using research; ensuring that research had practical application; and \npromotion of a colleagial atmosphere between researchers and teachers (see also \nRatcliffe, 1988).   \n \nFindings from a case study of 47 teachers by Shkedi (1998) in Israel suggested that very \nfew teachers turned to research literature to expand professional knowledge, solve \nproblems or to meet the requirements of their job.  Teachers in the study argued that they \ndid not use research literature because they perceived it to be irrelevant, unhelpful and \ntoo theoretical.  They claimed they lacked time, did not trust the findings, and could not \n 13\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nunderstand the language or make sense of the statistics.  Teachers also said that research \nliterature was not available in their immediate surroundings but, when they did read \nliterature they gave preference to practical educational literature that could be applied \ndirectly to their teaching.  Most of those using research literature were doing so in the \ncontext of academic study, rather than to support their teaching.   The author also argues \nthat teachers perceived educational research to be quantitative in nature and found that \nteachers were largely unaware of the potential and value of qualitative research.   \n \nThe best evidence for this review is provided by a study conducted by Cousins & \nLeithwood (1993).  Survey questions focused on both the characteristics of the source of \ninformation and the context in which dissemination had taken place.   The authors argue \nthat dissemination to encourage the use of information for school improvement should \nnot aim at merely prompting practitioners to replicate the work of others.  They conclude \nthat school improvement is an organisational change process, that schools are social \nsystems and knowledge is socially constructed, therefore, social learning needs to take \nplace.  In order to promote social learning, the authors conclude that school improvement \ninformation should be shared and that practitioners should be involved in the design, \ndelivery and follow-up activities associated with school improvement.  The authors found \nthat the relevance of the source information was a key factor in the use of research \nfindings and that respondents (principals and district staff) were more likely to use \nresearch when the findings met their information needs.  The authors concluded that the \nperceived sophistication (how finely tuned it was to match local needs), value, relevance, \nand timeliness of the information had a positive impact on its use.   Social marketing was \n 14\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nadvocated by the authors as a way of encouraging school improvement on the basis that \ndissemination should meet the needs of the users.  The authors also point out that there is \na need to create a demand for information associated with school improvement.  \n \nThe use of research by medical health practitioners \nThis section provides a brief overview of key papers from the medical field.  There is a \nconsiderable body of research concerning the use of research by medical practitioners \n(e.g MacGuire, 1990; Winter, 1990; Bassett, 1992; Closs & Cheater, 1994; Rodgers, \n1994; Moore, 1995; Verhoeven et al., 1995; Lacey, 1996; Schmitt, 1999; Bryant, 2000; \nRodgers, 2000).  Studies examining evidence based practice (e.g. Barker and Gilbert, \n2000; Falshaw et al., 2000) concluded that whether research is used depends on how \nrelevant it is to the NHS agenda and how accessible it is to those in the field.  \n \nA meta-analysis by Haug (1997) aimed to find out what kind of generalisations could be \nmade about physicians\u2019 preferences for sources of professional information.  This meta-\nanalysis provides some of the \u2018best evidence\u2019 because it summarises the data from twelve \nstudies and highlights a number of issues related to information-seeking behaviour.  Haug \n(1997) found that physicians appeared to choose the sources of information that were \nmost easily accessible and most applicable to the problem, and practitioners frequently \nrely on indirect sources of information about research findings, such as discussions with \ncolleagues.  Bryant (2000) conducted research in England using face-to-face interviews \nwith GPs and concluded that they rarely sought information in order to keep up-to-date.  \n 15\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nThey were anxious about \u2018information overload\u2019 and the availability of time needed to \nsearch for information. \n \nBarriers and facilitators to using research in medicine and nursing \nSystematic searches identified a small number of opinion papers on barriers and \nfacilitators to research utilisation in medicine which concentrate on discussing the \ndifferent levels of implementation of research findings in nursing (MacGuire, 1990; \nBassett, 1992; Closs & Cheater, 1994; Moore, 1995; Lacey, 1996).  Following influential \nempirical research by Funk et al. (1991) there have also been a number of empirical \nresearch studies which focused on barriers and incentives to the use of research findings \nin nursing (Champion & Leach, 1989; Bostrum & Suter, 1993; Lacey, 1994; Rodgers, \n1994; Barta, 1995; Funk et al., 1995; Hunt, 1996; Meah et al., 1996; Camiah, 1997; \nCarroll et al., 1997; Dunn et al., 1998; Kajermo et al., 1998, 2000; Le May et al., 1998; \nHundley et al., 2000; Parahoo, 2000; Parahoo et al., 2000; Retsas, 2000).   \n \nOne of the most comprehensive studies is a cross-sectional survey by Funk et al. (1991, \n1995) because the sample used for this survey was a large, stratified random sample.  \nFunk et al. (1991) devised a \u2018barriers\u2019 scale for a research study with a target sample of \n5,000, and an achieved sample of 1,989 registered nurses (including nurse managers and \nadministrators) in the US. They found that the most frequently cited facilitator was \n\u2018enhanced administrative support and encouragement for research utilisation\u2019, \nmentioned by a third of those surveyed.  They argued for the creation of an organisational \nculture that values and uses research. Other suggestions were: advanced education; \n 16\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \ncolleague support networks; and employing more nurses with research skills as role \nmodels.   A study by Dunn et al. (1998) carried out in the UK with 316 nurses, used the \nBarriers Scale, and found that factors associated with the \u2018setting\u2019 were consistently \nperceived as strong barriers to research utilisation by nurses in both the UK and the US.  \nThe major barriers were identified as: insufficient time to implement new ideas; lack of \nco-operation from physicians; lack of time to read research; and inadequate facilities to \nsupport implementation.   \n \nDo medical practitioners make greater use of research findings \nthan heads and teachers and if so, why? \nSearches identified two studies that set out to compare the behaviour and attitudes of \ndifferent professional groups, including professionals in education alongside those in \nmedicine and other fields (e.g. Latham, 1993; Hannan et al., 2000).   The most pertinent \nfindings for this review emerged from a small-scale cross sectional survey by Hannan et \nal. (2000) who found that compared with surgeons, GPs and teachers appeared to be less \ninvolved or interested in research. They suggest that the different level of involvement \nreflected its importance for career advancement among surgeons, whereas this is not the \ncase for the other two professional groups.  Although findings from a range of studies \nsuggest that educationalists rarely use research findings compared with other \nprofessionals, searches identified little convincing or robust evidence to indicate how, \nand why practitioners in other fields use research findings more effectively.   \n \n 17\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nThe role of change agents, opinion-leaders and diffusion \nnetworks in the dissemination and adoption of ideas for school \nimprovement \nThere has been much discussion about approaches to the dissemination of research \nfindings in education and other fields (Louis et al., 1988; Richardson & Anders, 1990; \nFrantz, 1991; Leimu, 1992; Louis, 1992; Klein, 1993a and b; Huberman, 1993; Louis, \n1996; Myers, 1998; Rumsey, 1998; Brooker & MacPherson, 1999; Schmitt, 1999; \nCampbell, 2000; Hopkins & Levin, 2000; Stanton & Morris, 2000; Louis & Jones, 2001).   \n \nA number of significant empirical research publications have also focused on the \ndissemination of research findings (Mills, 1992; Cousins & Leithwood, 1993; Michel & \nSneed, 1995; Rogers, 1995; DETYA, 2000) and the links between researchers and \npractitioners (Reed & Franks, 1989; Huberman, 1990; Cousins & Simon, 1991; Crewe & \nNorris, 1991; Ordonez & Maclean, 1997; Elliott & Popay, 2000). In addition, the \nNational Center for the Dissemination of Disability Research (NCDDR) (an organisation \nbased in the USA) carried out a survey of literature which aimed to provide a knowledge \nbase for improving access to and use of research results (NCDDR, 1996). \n \nThe diffusion of innovations model (Rogers, 1995), is widely acknowledged as having \nmade a significant contribution to our understanding of the dissemination of innovations \nand ideas.  Rogers presents a comprehensive analysis of the way new ideas are \ndisseminated and adopted by users, based on research carried out in the US and drawing \non examples from agriculture, health education, manufacturing and technology.  Rogers \n 18\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nargues that the adoption of new ideas is a process of social change and he identifies two \nkey roles in that process.  Change agents are people with professional training who are \ncharged with bringing about the wider adoption of a new idea.  Opinion leaders are \npeople within a field who are influential in their social networks.  Rogers, therefore, \nsuggests that effective dissemination of ideas can be achieved by identifying opinion \nleaders, and concentrating change agents\u2019 contacts on them.  Kanefsky (2001) recognises \nthe relevance of Rogers\u2019 model within education and identifies a number of issues that \nneed to be considered by research funders and change agents (with particular reference to \nthe Learning and Skills Council).   \n \nFor the purpose of this review, key findings emerging from the research literature are \npresented under the following headings derived from the diffusion of innovations model: \nchange agents; opinion leaders; and diffusion networks.   \n \nResearch into the use of change agents \nA change agent is: \u2018An individual, such as a teacher, consultant or manager who \ninfluences clients\u2019 innovation-decisions in a direction deemed desirable by a change \nagency\u2019 (Rogers, 1995, p. 336).  Governments and local authorities, therefore, frequently \nact as change agencies and may seek to increase the impact of research.  The role of \nchange agents in this process has been the subject of considerable discussion and \nspeculation  (Dockrell, 1993; King & Wahlstrom, 1993; Roberts, 1993; Hill, 1998; \nHutchinson & Whitehouse, 1999; Goldstein & Woodhouse, 2000; Wilkins, 2001). \n \n 19\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nA study by Bolam (1994) provided the best empirical evidence on research impact and \nthe role of change agents in the UK.   He focused sharply on the findings from four \nresearch projects and on the subsequent implementation of recommendations from those \nprojects.  Bolam (1994) carried out research to reflect on whether key aspects of \nnationally funded continuing professional development (CPD) research projects have \nmade a difference to policy and practice over a period of fifteen years.   \n \nAs a result of this analysis, Bolam challenged some of the assumptions made about the \nlinks between dissemination of research findings and impact on policy and practice.  He \nfound that the most significant factors affecting impact on practice are resources and \nrelevant regulations.  Initiatives that were funded and made compulsory were likely to be \nimplemented, whereas optional initiatives, especially those that were not adequately \nfunded, were unlikely to be implemented.  He concludes that there is no direct positive \nrelationship between systematic dissemination of research findings to practitioners and \nimpact on policy and practice.  Bolam recommends that researchers seek ways of \ncommunicating their findings to policy makers and funding agencies. \n \nResearch on opinion leaders in education \nRogers suggests that opinion leaders have credibility to activate peer networks, which \nhelp to diffuse the innovation to others.  They are also characterised by their tendency to \nadopt new ideas before their peers (Rogers, 1995).   \n \n 20\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nA study by Wikely (1998) attempted to find out how research on good practice can be \ndisseminated to teachers in such a way as to inform school improvement.  This research \nwas the only empirical study identified by the review that specifically considered the use \nof teachers as \u2018opinion leaders\u2019 to disseminate information to their peers.   The chosen \ndissemination strategy involved teacher\/managers from six high performing departments \nsharing a written report, presentations and group discussions with their peers in a \nconsortium of 15 schools.   \n \nThe dissemination activities were intended to stimulate discussion about effectiveness, so \nthat teachers in other departments could select, amend and apply those features that \nappeared relevant to them.  However, instead of engaging with this process, the author \nfound clear evidence of defensive behaviour among staff.  The opinion leaders were \nperceived to have an unwarranted status as \u2018experts\u2019.  Teachers thought that the intention \nwas to impose a particular style or model on their departments by offering practical \ntraining in how to be a \u2018good\u2019 department.    The teachers challenged the validity of the \nresearch, and claimed that their unique situations invalidated the application of its \nfindings.  Wikely suggests that opinion leaders should be accepted as such by their peers \nand that the dissemination of research findings must be carefully facilitated in relation to \nthe needs of practitioners.  Clearly, asking teachers to use research findings is not a \nsimple matter, even where potential opinion leaders have been identified.  \n \n 21\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nResearch on diffusion networks in education \n\u2018Diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain \nchannels over time among the members of a social system.\u2019 (Rogers, 1995, p. 5).  \nProbably one of the most important developments in defining a theory of dissemination is \nthe increased focus on the social processes involved (Huberman, 1990; Louis & Jones, \n2001).  The use of \u2018links\u2019 or \u2018networks\u2019 in the dissemination of research findings to \nteachers has been discussed by a number of authors (Wilkins, 1988, 2000; Johnstone et \nal., 1990; Slavin, 1990; Maclure, 1992; Hammersley & Scarth, 1993; Hallinan, 1996; \nHargreaves, 1996a; Mitchell & Boyd, 1998; Davies, 1999; Harris, 2000, 2001; Kirst, \n2000).   \n \nHuberman (1990) provides the best empirical evidence on diffusion networks in \neducation because his research examined the interaction between researchers and \npractitioners.  He evaluated 25 projects from a national vocational education research \nprogramme in Switzerland to establish how and whether such interaction impacted on the \neffective dissemination of research findings.  Huberman (1990) found that good links \nestablished prior to and during a research study contributed to a more energetic approach \nto dissemination of the findings later on.  He deduced that there is a relationship between \nthe type and amount of contact made during a research study and the strength of the \nrelationship between researchers and practitioners 18 months afterwards. Closer \nrelationship help researchers to take into account the local context and predict the way in \nwhich the findings will be implemented.  The author concludes that by strengthening the \nlinks between practitioners and researchers at every stage of the research process, the \n 22\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nimpact of research can be improved.   However, in her review of research literature, \nLouis (1996) suggests that Huberman\u2019s study is limited because he made an assumption \nthat there is a gap between research knowledge and practitioner knowledge that cannot be \nbridged without calculated interventions.    \n \nDissemination and adoption of ideas for school improvement \nIn her narrative literature review Louis (1996) analysed emerging theories of knowledge \nutilisation and explored a link with research on educational improvement.  The paper \ndiscusses why current models are inadequate as a way of explaining observed phenomena \nrelating to dissemination and knowledge utilisation in education.  She argues that policy \nmakers in most countries believe that with proper \u2018sticks and carrots\u2019, schools can be \nencouraged or required to become better consumers of research results.  She points out \nthat popular documents funded by a variety of agencies (mostly in the USA) were \nintended to pave the way towards a better understanding of the connection between \nresearch knowledge and good school practice.  However, she argues that knowledge is \npolitical and political contexts are critical to understanding knowledge use.   \n \nLouis suggests that all knowledge is local and knowledge created elsewhere must be \ncompatible with existing belief structures so that it becomes legitimised and has utility \nwithin the local setting.  She suggests that research knowledge generated in universities \nor research institutes is only one source of knowing and that its use must be negotiated \nthrough the dissemination process.  She also observes that there has been a trend to \ninvolve practitioners in setting some research agendas.  However, she argues that \n 23\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \ninvolving users will not necessarily make the research more usable, except among those \nwho have been directly involved.  Louis concludes that the main barriers to knowledge \nuse in the public sector are not at the level of individual resistance but lie in an \ninstitutionalised culture that does not foster learning.  She also points out that the \nutilisation and impact of research on practice can only be assessed over a long period of \ntime. \n \nResearch impact on teaching and learning \nHillage et al. (1998) expressed concern that actions by decision-makers and practitioners \nare insufficiently informed by research, and dissemination is viewed as problematic.  The \nfollowing dissemination concerns are identified: use of publication in academic journals \nand inaccessibility of journals to non-academic audiences; lack of encouragement given \nto dissemination to practitioners; and absence of time and support to help practitioners \naccess research.  \n \nThe searches for this review identified one key, substantial and comprehensive study by \nDETYA (Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (2000) carried out in \nAustralia, which provides the best evidence of issues related to research impact.  The \nauthors identified a tension between educators and researchers, which they attributed to \ntheir different goals.  They conclude that the practitioner wants new solutions to \noperational matters whilst the researcher seeks new knowledge. Two other issues were \nalso raised by the report: the poor co-ordination and thin spread of research activities and \nthe limited level of planning for training researchers in the dissemination of research.  \n 24\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nThe report indicates that post-graduate students (mainly part-time) constitute the largest \nsingle group involved in educational research in Australia.  The conclusion to the \nDETYA (2000) study states that the impact of research in schools and in policy \nformulation depends greatly on educators valuing research, and on their ability to critique \nand apply it.  The authors suggest that for ideas to be accessible to educators and policy-\nmakers, researchers have to market their knowledge actively to the education community \nas well as the research community. The author highlights the inadequacies of conceiving \nthe relationship between educational research and practice as a linear relationship.  \n\u2018Impact\u2019 suggests a clear, identifiable, measurable and direct relationship.  The report \ncontests such a view.  Instead a multi-layered, unpredictable, interacting process of \nengagement between the researcher and the educator is presented.   This engagement \ninvolves both researcher and educator in the creation of new knowledge and new \nsolutions to challenges.  The question of impact then becomes one of effective and \nresponsive linkages at all levels. \n \nDiscussion and conclusions \nCritical analysis of the findings from this systematic review resulted in the emergence of \nthe following themes in both education and medicine: the need for cultural change; and \nmanagement strategies.  The following themes emerged from empirical research \u2013 only in \nthe field of education: research design issues; training and professional development; \ncollaboration, partnerships and links; and communication networks.  \n \n 25\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nOpinion papers that explored barriers to research utlisation tend to argue that the \nemphasis should shift from a personal level to an organisational level, and that it is \nsimplistic to blame individual practitioners for their failure to access or use research.  The \nconclusions from empirical research, in both education and in nursing, confirm that the \nmain barriers to knowledge use in the public sector are not at the level of individual \nresistance but originated in an institutionalised culture that does not foster learning.  \nEducation practitioners appear to have very little incentive to access research findings \nand the language and presentation of research is perceived as alienating, particularly \nwhen the findings rely on statistical analysis.  Education practitioners who are using \nresearch are likely to be doing so in the context of academic study.  The key \nrecommendation that emerges from empirical studies is that managers are viewed as key \nfacilitators, and there is a need to create and develop an organisational culture that values \nand uses research. \n \nThe development of management strategies to facilitate research use was recommended \nby authors of opinion papers in both education and in medicine.  The value, relevance, \nand timeliness of research information is thought to have a positive impact on use. \nAuthors in the education field suggest that there is a lack of good, well-founded research \nevidence into key policy issues and, therefore, they argued for better professional \nknowledge about the management of schools, and effective strategies for teaching and \nlearning.  Some authors recommend that performance data should be managed effectively \nand used to help to improve schools. Further research is needed to examine specific \nmanagement interventions, projects or programmes that facilitate research use.    \n 26\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \n \nFindings from this systematic review suggest that the design of research studies can also \nimpede research use in education.  Empirical studies conclude that there is a tension \nbetween educators and researchers, which is attributed to differences in their professional \ngoals.  Teachers perceive educational research to be quantitative in nature and frequently \nchallenge the validity of the research, arguing that their unique situations invalidate the \napplication of its findings.  Practitioners are identified as seeking new solutions to \noperational matters whilst the researchers are characterised as seeking new knowledge.  \nFindings from this review suggest that many teachers judge a study\u2019s merits on the basis \nof whether the findings can be translated into procedures that work in classrooms.  \nFindings from empirical research in education reveal that most teachers using research \nliterature are likely to be doing so in the context of academic study, rather than to support \ntheir teaching.  Post-graduate training appears to contribute towards raising practitioners\u2019 \nregard for educational research knowledge. The impact of research in schools and in \npolicy formulation appears to depend greatly on educators valuing research, and on their \nability to critique and apply it.  Teachers may also needed more sustained opportunities to \nlink their understanding of research to their knowledge of teaching and they appeared to \nchoose the sources of information that were most easily accessible and most applicable to \nthe problem. \n \nAuthors of opinion papers argue that teacher involvement in research is one of the keys to \ngreater research utilisation in education.  Research by Louis (1996), however, contradicts \nthis assumption.  She argues that involving users does not necessarily make the research \n 27\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nmore usable \u2013 except among those who have been directly involved.  Authors of opinion \npapers also frequently argue that teachers and policy-makers learn from research, but \nresearch utilisation works best in settings of collaboration and mutual support.  They \nconclude that effective programmes for change should be utilitarian, inspirational, \nprovide immediate payoffs and meet local needs.  Findings from empirical studies \nindicate that school improvement is an organisational change process, which implies that \nmere involvement in research is insufficient.  They view schools as social systems and \nknowledge as socially and politically constructed, which places emphasis on \norganisational and professional cultures as the context for social learning.   For such \nsocial learning to take place, empirical researchers conclude that research findings should \nbe shared and practitioners should be involved in the design, focus, delivery, and follow-\nup activities.   \n \nEmpirical research shows that there is no direct positive relationship between systematic \ndissemination of research findings and impact on policy and practice.  Although evidence \nfrom some empirical studies concluded that effective dissemination of ideas is facilitated \nthrough the identification and use of opinion leaders, research also demonstrates that \nopinion leaders need to be accepted as such by their peers, and the dissemination of \nresearch findings must relate closely to the needs of practitioners.   The findings of this \nreview suggest that the most significant factors affecting impact on practice in education \nis legislation because schools will adopt policies, whether or not they are evidence based.  \nHowever, if such initiatives are not adequately funded, they are unlikely to be adopted. \n \n 28\nHemsley-Brown, J.V. & Sharp, C. (2004). \u2018The use of research to improve professional practice: a \nsystematic review of the literature\u2019, Oxford Review of Education. (forthcoming). \nThe evidence from this review suggests that good links established prior to and during a \nresearch study contribute towards a more energetic approach to dissemination of the \nfindings from educational research.  For ideas to be accessible to educators and policy-\nmakers, researchers have to market their knowledge to the education community as well \nas the research community.  Marketing, in a research context, means anticipating and \nidentifying the needs of the users (practitioners and policy-makers), meeting those needs \nthrough participative research activities, and effectively disseminating research findings \nthrough the word-of-mouth recommendations of successful user-opinion-leaders.    \n \nIn conclusion, differences in the way that research knowledge is constructed in the social \nsciences has led to researchers being challenged about their findings, particularly in \nrelation to the context, generalisability and validity of the research.   For these reasons the \ndevelopment of communication networks, links between researchers and practitioners, \nand greater involvement of practitioners in the research process, have emerged as \nstrategies for improving research impact.    \n \nMain text 6,540 words \n \nReferences \nBARKER, J. & GILBERT, D.
