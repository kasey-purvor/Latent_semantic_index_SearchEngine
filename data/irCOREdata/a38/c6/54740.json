There has\nbeen little published evidence of their impact on proc-\nesses of care or improved patient outcomes. Reported\neffects on prescribing behaviour or process changes have\nnot adequately accounted for secular (underlying) trends\nin performance.\nIt has been argued that studies of educational interven-\ntions should evaluate change in a geographical area\n(rather than a single practice) targeting an identifiable\nlearning need which if addressed could lead to real\nimprovements in patient outcomes [7]. In the case of\ninterprofessional learning, \"when [members or students\nof] two or more professions learn with, from and about\none another to improve collaboration and the quality of\ncare [8]\" it should also be focused on a relevant problem\nappropriate for the multiprofessional group [4]. In order\nto do this a mixed methods study was conducted into the\neffect on practice prescribing and behaviour of an educa-\ntional session on diabetes care provided by Lincolnshire\nTARGET (Time for Audit, Review, Guidelines, Education\nand Training), set up as an multidisciplinary protected\nlearning time (PLT) scheme, and innovative in that it\ninvolved all general practices with their associated pri-\nmary care teams in a large rural county of the East Mid-\nlands, United Kingdom.\nThe educational session was centred around the HOPE\nstudy which provided evidence that patients with coexist-\ning diabetes and hypertension or other cardiovascular risk\nfactors should be treated with an ACE inhibitor at a ther-\napeutic dose (specifically ramipril 10 mg) [9] to reduce\ncardiovascular morbidity and mortality. An interrupted\ntime series analysis showed a significant increase in ACE\ninhibitor prescribing across the county, taking into\naccount secular change, following the educational inter-\nvention (odds ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.93) with an\nincrease in prescribing of ramipril by 52,345 items\n(31,132 items at 10 mg) at a cost of \u00a3292 k to \u00a3460 k\ndepending on formulation [10].\nThe aim of this parallel qualitative study was to investigate\nthe perceptions of practitioners on the effect of the educa-\ntional event relating to their processes of diabetes care. We\nwere interested in what practices did, if anything, to\nimplement and sustain change as a result of the educa-\ntional intervention, what the barriers to change were,\nwhat other external factors may have led to change, and\nwhich elements of the educational intervention were\nhelpful or not helpful.\nMethods\nLincolnshire TARGET\nLincolnshire TARGET was set up in 2000 with the aim of\nproviding needs based learning for general practitioners,\ncommunity nurses and administrative staff working in\nprimary care during working hours. This was achieved by\nusing local out-of-hours cooperatives and other internal\narrangements in group practices to provide primary care\nservices during educational sessions. Each session was\norganised and delivered by a team of educators, led by a\nclinical director with administrative support, and focused\non a topic based on both local practitioner need and\nnational priorities. The sessions involved a combination\nof lectures delivered by local, regional or national opinion\nleaders and facilitated small interdisciplinary group work\ninvolving medical, nursing and administrative staff. At the\nend of each session individual primary care teams worked\nin small groups to discuss how they might implement\nchange as a result of the education. TARGET included edu-\ncational sponsorship from a number of pharmaceutical\ncompanies and promotional stands were also a feature of\nthe sessions. Lunch was provided before the educational\nmeeting began but no other incentives were offered to\nencourage attendance.\nIntervention of interest\nThe educational session on diabetes was delivered in\nNovember 2001 and lasted about 2.5 hours. It consisted\nof a welcome session outlining the objectives for the after-\nnoon, an opening talk to set the scene of diabetes in gen-\neral practice followed by parallel talks for clinicians and\nadministrative staff. The first session for clinicians was\ndesigned to look at diabetes prevalence and screening fol-\nlowing which a local general practitioner who had suc-\ncessfully implemented the findings from HOPE into his\nown practice was able to describe practical steps leading to\nimprovements in ACE inhibitor prescribing for diabetes\nwithin his practice.\nFor other (including nonclinical) staff a talk was given\nfrom the patient's perspective by a speaker from Diabetes\nUK, a talk on the diabetic clinic was given by a local spe-\ncialist diabetic nurse and a practical session looking at\ncomputer data, risk assessment and routine procedures,\nfor example in reception, was given. Finally practices\nteams met together as a group, to discuss the barriers to\nimproving practice processes for diabetes care, including\nimplementation of HOPE, and considered an action plan\nof how they might overcome barriers and implement bet-\nter systems of care. Each plan was fed back to the whole\naudience.\nSelection and interviews\nInterviewees were chosen purposively from selected prac-\ntices. Nurses and general practitioners providing diabetesPage 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2008, 8:4 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/8\/4care in practices were specifically chosen because they\nwere more likely to have in-depth knowledge of changes\nin processes of care whether related to the intervention or\nnot. Practices were selected according to the extent of\nchange in prescribing following the educational interven-\ntion. Stratified sampling was used to get a variety of per-\nspectives because the quantitative study showed that there\nwere differences in change in prescribing rates in practices\nin temporal relation to the intervention. Practices were\ntherefore divided into four strata depending on change in\nprescribing as follows [10]:\nStratum 1 (S1): little increase in prescribing before or after\nthe educational intervention\nStratum 2 (S2): some increase in prescribing before and\nafter\nStratum 3 (S3): little change before but a great deal after\nStratum 4 (S4): a great deal of change before and after\nOne of the authors (KS) selected three practices, ordered\nat random, from each of the four strata and invited them\nto take part in the qualitative interview study. If a practice\ndeclined to take part the next practice on the list from that\nstratum was invited. A total of twelve interviews were car-\nried out, three from each of the four strata. Interviewees\n(practices) and interviewers were blinded to the practice\nstratum so that neither the practice, nor the interviewers\nwere aware of the stratum from which the practice was\ndrawn at the time of the interview (see Table 1). The audi-\notape from one practice in stratum 2 was inadvertently\ndamaged precluding analysis. Informed consent was\nsought from participants.\nInterviews and data analysis\nThe interviews looked for perceptions of change in diabe-\ntes care and facilitators of change. This included not only\nthe educational session but also any other factors that may\nhave prompted change, barriers to change and evidence of\npractice interventions to implement change (Table 2).\nOne-to-one in depth interviews took place at the practice\npremises in 2003, within 18 months of the educational\nsession. They were 45 to 90 minutes in duration and con-\nducted individually by two researchers. They were tape\nrecorded and transcribed in full. Qualitative data from the\ntranscripts were analysed using specific software (QSR\nN6). A sample of the transcripts was independently exam-\nined by all members of the project team and categories\nderived by induction. Categories were decided and\ngrouped into themes through discussion. Themes were\nidentified in the context of the stratum and the profes-\nsional discipline of the interviewee and agreed through\nexamination of transcripts by all members of the team.\nThematic analysis was used to make sense of the data. This\ninvolved examining the transcribed interviews to identify\nkey issues and then coding and categorising text express-\ning these recurrent issues to form explanatory themes.\nEthics committee\nLincolnshire Research Ethics Committee (study number:\n02\/1\/680). The study was approved for research manage-\nment and governance by West Lincolnshire PCT.\nResults\n101 practices, 38 from East Lincolnshire, 25 from Lincoln-\nshire South, and 38 from West Lincolnshire were included\nin the study. Of these, 15 were training practices, 56 Per-\nsonal Medical Services (PMS), 18 single-handed practices\nand 59 dispensing.

From 12 prac-\ntices only one or more GPs attended and no nurses, from\n8 practices one or more practice nurses or health visitors\nbut no GPs, and from 56 at least one GP and at least one\npractice nurse or health visitor attended. All 101 practices\nhad their prescribing data analysed for ACE inhibitor pre-\nscribing before and after the educational session and the\nquantitative analysis has been described in detail in a sep-\narate paper [10].\nThe results have been written under the five main themes\nemerging from the data which include changes in proc-\nesses of care, facilitators for change, barriers to change,\nsustaining change and perceived effect of PLT (See Table\n3). In order to differentiate between the different strata\nand also the professional group of the interviewee, each\nquote was identified as such, for example stratum one, GP\nquote (S1 GP), or stratum three nurse (S3 NS). The effect\nof stratum on change was also explored.\nChanges in processes of care\nThe main changes stated by interviewees in the care of\npatients with diabetes in the year following the educa-\ntional intervention included increased used of protocols\nand policies; using ACE inhibitors as a first line for\npatients with diabetes who developed hypertension;\nswitching patients to glitazones; increased use of aspirin\nand statins; putting patients on insulin either directly or\nby referral to secondary care; quicker titration of drugs\nleading to increased prescriptions; increased screening\nand review of patients with diabetes. Practices in strata 1\nand 2, though still aspiring to improve care were less able\nto specify the precise interventions by which they did this.\nProtocol development\n\"...We've had a diabetes protocol in existence for about 4 or 5\nyears...it's now in its third different edition...because we did the\n'Micro-Hope' and NSF as a single editing and its now been\nredone for the Quality and Outcomes Framework...\" (S4 GP)\nPolicy review\n\"Well we've reviewed the policy of putting all the hypertensive\npatients on ACE inhibitors ... and ACE inhibitors as a first line\nfor all diabetic patients who turned hypertensive after they\ndeveloped diabetes.\" (S4 GP)\nIncreased review leading to additional prescribing \"We're see-\ning diabetic patients much more regularly than we did, and\nwe're noticing changes in their blood pressure and cholesterol\nlevels, making sure they have more screenings and all their\nchecks are in place.\" (S1 GP)\nTable 2: Semistructured interview schedule\n1.

[We] put most of the diabetic patients on aspirin, the\nmajority of them on a statin regardless of their cholesterol\nlevel.\" (S3 NS)\n\"...We just referred the tenth patient to the nurse [for insulin],\nthose ten patients otherwise would have been referred to hospi-\ntal.\" (S4 GP)\n\"We've picked up a lot of new diabetics, simply by the recall sys-\ntem we have for our CHD patients and a lot of them are turning\nup...\"(S1 GP)\n\"...If you come in for a blood test you tend to get a glucose done\nand it ifs high we then take it further we don't just think its\nslightly high, you know, watch your diet, we do tend to do a\ndiagnostic for a blood glucose test.\" (S3 NS)\nFacilitators for change\nThere were a number of explanatory factors offered by par-\nticipants as leading to these changes in diabetic care.\nThese ranged from dissatisfaction with current services to\ngovernment initiatives based on the outcomes of major\nresearch studies. The main reported facilitators of change\nwere financially driven performance targets, particularly\nthose set by the new GP contract and quality and out-\ncomes framework, large research studies such as HOPE\/\nMicro HOPE, and UKPDS as well as government guide-\nlines as outlined in the NICE guidance and Diabetes NSF.\nIncentives and resources\n\"We can now use the stream of resources coming in that are\ntied to quality, to employ people and health care assistants\" (S4\nGP)\n\"What's happened with the new contract is that you have been\ngiven a financial incentive to do it, to record it and to make it\navailable for auditing and for PCTs to make sure you have done\nit...\" (S2 GP)\nEvidence and guidance\n\"We decided as a practice after the publication of 'HOPE' that\nwe would take an opportunistic approach to starting diabetic\npatients on ramipril when we saw them and that's been reason-\nably successful in bringing our rates of ramipril prescription\nup.... \"(S4 GP)\n\"UKPDS was such a huge trial...so you couldn't miss it unless\nyou were blind...it's not that they were telling you something\nnew but it does have an input.\" (S1 GP)\n\"And of course all the NICE guidance that came out, particu-\nlarly with the use of diabetes zones, the drug therapies, foot care\nguidance that was out in January, that's influenced the way we\nrefer to podiatry and how the podiatry work with us now.\" (S3\nNS)\n\"Evidence from the National Service Framework...NICE and\nclinical guidelines... so probably all those things, the most\nimportant would probably be the NSF I would think.\" (S2 GP)\nInformation sources\nInformation was received from a number of sources\nincluding the Primary Care Organisations and profes-\nsional journals but drug representatives were also seen as\nan important source of information.\n\"The National Service Framework regarding diabetes and pro-\ntocols that have come in from the Trust.\" (S2 GP)\n\"Well I take a couple of these diabetes and CHD combined\njournals...and then if it's of particular interest to me or partic-\nularly pertinent to a patient then I might look it up.\" (S3 NS)\n\"I think they [drug representatives] probably played a bit more\nof a part here that they usually let them do which is that they\ndid persuade me that glitazones were probably a good thing...\"\n(S4 GP)\nClinical audit\nAudit and benchmarking care against other practices' per-\nformance was perceived to be an important driver for\nchange in all practices interviewed. Clinicians in most\npractices used 'real-time' entry to improve data recording\nbut for some practices this was a relatively recent phenom-\nenon.\n\"...We've taken a sample of about 50\u201360 patients we've picked\nup at random and we've followed them right the way through\nand it's a report back but a lot of things have changed over those\ntwo years so its quite interesting.\" (S3 NS)\n\"You're in line with your colleagues and thinking along the\nsame line I think sort of group approach... everybody's calling\nthe same tune, at least within this county.\" (S1 GP)\nInformation technology and decision support\n\"We're all using the computer live and we've being doing so for\nquite a while, it's take a bit of a churn to get people to do it but\nit's working.\" (S1 GP)\n\"We've got a very slight detailed template...we've got extra\nthings on that we like and we also have sub templates for podi-\natry and eye screening retinopathy...\" (S3 NS)Page 5 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2008, 8:4 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/8\/4Role redesign\nA number of practices encouraged nurses, particularly the\ndiabetes nurse, to take a leading role in delivery. Health\ncare assistants also supported diabetes care, either work-\ning alongside the nurse or to protocols supervised by the\ngeneral practitioner (GP). GPs appreciated that using\nhealth care assistants in this way was a radical change.\n\" [We are] encouraging the nurse practitioner to take on more\nof a leading role...\" (S1 GP)\n\"Our diabetic nurse...we do tap into her, her sources and her\nskills, and if we have something difficult we will turn to her\nrather than a hospital clinic...\"\"the health care assistants do the\nblood tests,...height,...weight, the blood pressure, they check\nthat they're seeing the chiropodist, ... the opticians and they fill\nin as much as they can.\" (S3 GP)\nTraining in diabetes\nTraining of professionals in the care of diabetes was also\nseen as a facilitator of change. By contrast one practice in\nstratum 1 felt that he was under too much other pressure\nto consider training in diabetes.\n\"I think everybody who sees a diabetic patient should have had\nsome training, you know, not just the minimum, hide behind\nthe one day, diabetes management course its got to be some-\nthing much more encompassing the complexities of the dis-\nease.\" (S3 NS)\n\"I went to the diabetes UK conference two years ago and came\nback from that really fired up, so the doctors have very much let\nit be led by me...\" (S3 SN)\nPatient involvement and empowerment\nClinicians interviewed expressed ambivalence about\npatient empowerment. Some clinicians felt that patients\nwere increasingly knowledgeable about their condition,\noften using the Internet for information, and this affected\nhow they provided services.\nGiving patients written information about their condition\nwas seen as empowering. Some practices offered routine\nannual reviews whilst others actively encouraged patients\nto decide when to contact the practice for additional care\nor advice. Patient held records were also mentioned by\none practice that felt that they helped inform patients\nabout what had been done for them.\n\"I was looking at ways in which to empower the patients and\nwhat that empowerment actually meant to people. What we\nactually discovered was, empowerment meant different things\nto different people.\" (S1 GP)\n\"A lot of patients would really we 'did' it for them.... I'm afraid\nI'm a bit sceptical about patient empowerment, I think there are\npatients who do but I'm not sure that it's as quite as wide\nspread...as the enthusiasts for it would have you believe.\" (S4\nGP)\n\"What we do is send off a pack with various nutrition informa-\ntion...that sort of stuff, together with their annual blood forms\nand things like that so that when they come back we then invite\nthem back to the clinic.\" (S1 GP)\n\"Because we only recall our patients once a year with having so\nmany we rely on them doing the blood test and coming in if\nthere's a change and telling us, I mean that again is patient\neducation but we spend a lot time sort of explaining that if\nthere's a big change...don't wait...\"(S3 GP)\nBarriers to change\nInertia was cited as a hurdle to change. One of these prac-\ntices had undergone significant change already, the other\nless so. Other stated barriers included resources, concerns\nover doing more harm than good with medication and\nlack of secondary care support.\nInertia\n\"I think that partly it's the inertia in the system that when\nyou're doing things and the results show you that you're doing\npretty well there's a tendency to say, well fine, don't need to put\nmuch more effort into changing things here...\" (S4 GP)\n\"The most difficult thing is to then make the change... going\nback and deciding how we going to get better, making sure eve-\nryone knows about it and discussing it and finding the time to\ngo over it. I think we've done okay.\" (S2 GP)\nLack of resources\n\"I work twenty-six hours a week and I could spend every hour\nof that doing diabetics, I don't because I'm a nurse practitioner\nas well and with us being short-staffed at the moment...\" (S3\nNS)\n\"Time ... diabetes is not the only thing to get done, so it is the\npractice staff time.\" (S1 GP)\n\"Financial, lots of space and more opportunity for education.\"\n(S1 GP)\n\"Yes, there's two big barriers, one is time and one is money and\nthat's the two big things. I mean if we could fund more hours\nfor diabetic patients [although] we couldn't at the moment\nbecause of the building space...\" (S3 NS)Page 6 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2008, 8:4 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/8\/4Risks versus benefits of medication\nOne GP felt concern about putting patients who appeared\notherwise healthy onto an increasing number of poten-\ntially harmful medications in order to meet targets.\n\"I've got somebody in their late seventies...who's had type 2 dia-\nbetes for decades I find it very difficult motivating myself to get\nher cholesterol down. I find that very difficult to defend, and I\nappreciate that somebody else might say that you shouldn't be\nallowed to do that... Occasionally I think why am I making this\nwoman potentially ill with medication...blood pressure reduc-\ntion can be achieved ultimately but it may take four or five dif-\nferent approaches per patient and we have to ask ourselves, is\nthat in the patient's best interest and all these drugs?\" (S2 GP)\nLack of secondary care support\n\"Dietician support ... at the moment it is pie in the sky, I think\nits taking months and in fact the dietician have recently written\nto us suggesting that because they're snowed under, we get our\npractice nurses trained in what needs to be done for diabetic\nassessment.... There's always more demand than supply.\" (S2\nGP)\nSustaining change\nKey factors in sustaining change were a systematic and\nteam based approach with enthusiastic clinicians who\nhad a personal interest in diabetes care.\nSystematic attention to detail\n\"...getting into the habit so that when you see a patient coming\nback for review you try and make it automatic, should they be\non an ACE inhibitor, do they need to be on a statin, is their\nHBA1C still coming down or at least stable, so its really a ques-\ntion of getting into habits of it which is why a diabetic clinic is\nso advantageous because diabetes care more than anything else\nI think is a matter of attention to detail.\" (S4 GP)\nTeam approach\/holistic care\n\"I think it's the way you go about the change in the first\nplace...what we tend to do is take an idea to the team and let\nthem thrash it out and find out what the answers going to be.\"\n(S3 NS)\n\"...by combining diabetes and care of its complications particu-\nlarly Coronary Heart Disease together we actually care for\npatients fairly holistically, they don't on the whole go to the dia-\nbetic clinic and the Coronary Heart Disease clinic, we found\nthat we do them all in one go if we possibly can so that's time\nsaving...\"(S4 GP)\nPersonal interest and enthusiasm\n\"It's the enthusiasm with which I carry something through that\nbecomes infectious and that's why the change, it's not all down\nto me, it's like a domino effect.\" (S3 NS)\n\"I mean obviously it's been driven partially by the fact I have an\ninterest in diabetes anyway...\" (S1 GP)\nPerceived effect of TARGET on diabetes care\nParticipants expressed that the research outcomes of\nmajor studies and government policy had a big impact on\npractices. What difference did the protected learning time\nsession for diabetes make? Only one practice interviewed\nstated that they had not attended TARGET. This GP was a\nsingle-handed practitioner in stratum 1 and gave 'lack of\ntime' as his reason for non-attendance. Practices were\nmixed in their opinions about whether TARGET had made\na difference in their care provision for patients with diabe-\ntes. Although many felt that they were already implement-\ning change the majority of practices cited new systems\nsuch as screening at-risk patients, providing information\nfor receptionists, organising foot care and putting patients\non aspirin as resulting directly from TARGET.\nGroup work was specifically mentioned as helpful by two\npractices where working with 'fellow GPs', colleagues\nfrom different disciplines and other practices was seen as\nbeneficial. Peer pressure and being seen to be 'in line' with\ncolleagues appeared to be another important factor. In-\nhouse training using protected time was mentioned by\ntwo practices in strata 3 and 4 as a way of developing their\nindividual practice's systems. Expert speakers (non GP)\nhad a limited appeal to some practitioners whereas other\ngeneral practitioners were welcomed.\nSpecific changes made as result of TARGET attendance\n\"Yes, that came from TARGET when we did the screening for\nDiabetes, I remember being in the discussion about what's the\nmost economical way to detect the patients with undiagnosed\ndiabetes and as a consequence of that we target all our chronic\ndisease people for screening for diabetes...\"(S3 NS)\n\"...the girls from the reception found it particularly useful meet-\ning people with diabetes and discussing the ins and outs, they\nhaven't been quite so aware of Hypos and blood tests and things\nlike that...\"(S3 NS)\n\" [I] did go along to the TARGET morning that they had on foot\ncare in diabetes and that did modify my approach to examine\ndiabetic feet which has had a knock-on effect, we're pretty con-\nfident about doing them so that they're now pulling out podiatry\nfor examining diabetic feet apart from more complicated\nones...\"(S4 GP)\n\"Aspirin was one of the things that was brought up from the\nTARGET meeting because we've been discussing it already\nwhether to put diabetics on aspirin and they did discuss the\nHOPE study that really pushed along to decide that yes, we\nwere going to put people on aspirin, so yes that came directly out\nof TARGET...\" (S3 NS)Page 7 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2008, 8:4 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/8\/4Peer pressure in TARGET\n\"I did feel that there was like quite a big gap between people\nwho were doing their very best and the people who were not\ndoing very well at all.\" (S3 NS)\n\"If you're thinking of being more pro-active putting someone on\nan inhibitor and you go along and every other GP says \"Oh\nyeah, that's a good idea, we're doing that\", it will mean that\nyou do it, you get peer pressure to do it. If it was just one doctor\nwith a specialist interest [saying] by the way the latest research\nshows this and all the GPs say 'yeah we'll do that next time.\"\n(S2 GP)\nLack of change from TARGET\n\"It didn't make any difference here because we were already\ndoing most of what was done, ... the actual care in the practice\nwas already beyond what TARGET was aiming for anyway\".\n(S3 NS)\n\"No, because I didn't go to the meeting...I'm a single handed\npractitioner and it's not as though I've got to travel a million\nmiles to target, but it's the time factor...\"(S1 GP)\nUse of consultants in TARGET\n\"...It's nice to see the consultant from time to time but it's best\npractice in the situations that we find ourselves in and I think\nthere's a tendency to get a little tired with the experts telling\nus...\" (S4 GP)\nEffect of stratum on change\nPractices in strata 1 and 2 (little or some change before\nand after the educational intervention) generally reported\nmaking opportunistic rather than systematic improve-\nments whereas strata 3 and 4 practices (a great deal of\nchange before or after the educational intervention)\ntended to cite influencing factors and resulting changes in\npractice more often. Changes in processes were report to\noccur in every practice to some extent, but for participants\nfrom strata 3 and 4 described change at a faster pace. Prac-\ntices in stratum 4 in particular tended to have been early\nadopters, one practice in this group stating that they\nstarted implementing 'HOPE' very soon after publication.\nPractices in strata 3 & 4 were more likely to mention uti-\nlising protected learning time for in-house training in\norder to develop the practices' systems and teamworking.\nPractices in strata 3 & 4 were also more likely to acknowl-\nedge the benefit of diabetes education whereas those prac-\ntices in stratum 1 reported themselves to be under too\nmuch pressure from other areas of work to undergo addi-\ntional education.\nDiscussion\nPrincipal findings\nDespite some interviewees reporting that protected learn-\ning time (PLT) had not been a major influence in bringing\nabout change in prescribing, others indicated that PLT was\none of a number of key drivers for bringing about change\nin diabetes care in their practice [11]. Changes occurring\nafter the educational intervention included using ACE\ninhibitors as a first line for patients with diabetes who\ndeveloped hypertension, increased use of aspirin, switch-\ning patients to glitazones and commencing insulin; such\nchanges by leading to better control of glucose and cardi-\novascular risk factors are known to reduce complications\nof diabetes.\nReported facilitators of change were financially driven\nperformance targets, research evidence and national guid-\nance. Despite many interviewees suggesting that they had\nalready looked at diabetes care provision and that the edu-\ncational session may not necessarily have influenced this,\nmost practices offered explicit examples of change intro-\nduced directly as a result of the session. Other factors for\nchange linked to the educational session were peer sup-\nport, teamworking and benchmarking through audit and\ncomparative feedback.\nStrengths and weaknesses\nThe main strengths of the study were that it provided an\nexplanatory framework for changes linked to a quantita-\ntive study into the effect of protected learning time on pre-\nscribing, that the practices were stratified for inclusion\naccording to change in prescribing and that prescribing\nstatus was blinded by both interviewee and interviewer.\nLimitations included the small number of practices from\neach stratum and the potential for recall bias. Respondent\nvalidation, or other data validation, was not undertaken.\nContext of other literature\nThe findings support the role of peer influence and mod-\nelling in the learning process [12] which was more than\nsimply from networking opportunities [2]. The protected\nlearning session provided influential sources of informa-\ntion and delivered a personalised message, based on indi-\nvidual experience focusing on specific evidence linked to\nclear outcomes and encouraging change [13]. Local opin-\nion leaders and early adopters who contributed to the\neducational programme may have had a beneficial effect\non adoption by others [14] and the interactive nature of\nthe educational process was more likely to improve out-\ncomes compared to didactic lectures [15], a view sup-\nported by adult educational theory [16]. Respondents\nhighlighted audit and benchmarking as facilitators for\nchange and although evidence for this from the literature\nis equivocal [17] it could be argued that the audit process\nwas a mechanism for peer influence as well as providing a\nbasis for measurement of change. Interprofessional learn-\ning may also have had a positive impact [8] given that\nmembers of practices teams had the opportunity to dis-\ncuss potential changes during the session.

Utilising a combination of\napproaches to address barriers to change [19] was integral\nto the concept of the protected learning time scheme. The\neducational session addressed barriers to change, known\nto be helpful in modifying outcomes, by sharing learning\nacross practices [20]. Various other evidence based strate-\ngies to improve performance, such as identifying with the\nconcerns of practitioners and patients, using practice-\nbased active learning methods, delivery by opinion lead-\ners and peers, encouraging collaboration and teamwork\nwere employed as part of the teaching programme [21].\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nANS had the initial idea, contributed to the design and led\nthe study.
