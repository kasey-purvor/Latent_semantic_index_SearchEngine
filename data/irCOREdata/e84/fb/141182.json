Nitrite (92\nmu g l(-1)), particulate phosphorus (107 mu g l(-1)) and soluble phosphorus (74\nmu g l(-1)) exceeded environmental limits during base flow. Concentrations of\nnitrate and nitrite were decreased during the storm event, whereas all other\npollutants generally increased and exceeded environmental limits where\nspecified, especially when associated with a small subsidiary hydrograph on the\nrising limb of the main hydrograph. Total pollutants loads, when using a 60 min\nsampling frequency, would have led to significant over and under-estimations\ndepending on which 60 min sample set was used. In the worst case, loads of\nammonium could have been under-estimated by 35% or over estimated by 25% with\nerrors being associated with loads on the rising limb of the hydrograph and more\nspecifically a small subsidiary hydrograph. This subsidiary hydrograph may have\noccurred as a result of runoff from the farm hard standings within the\ncatchment.

To\nbetter understand these different source areas and pollutant dynamics there is a need for\nnovel tracing techniques to better understand their relative contribution and pathways.\n1. Introduction\nWith the recent and on-going introduction of legislation and policy aimed at improving\naquatic ecology and water quality in river basins (e.g. EU Water Framework Directive),\nattention is increasingly focused on efforts to decrease inputs of pollutants into surface\nand groundwaters. In agricultural areas, which represent a large proportion of the land\nsurface in Europe and North America, studies have shown that pollutants are usually\nderived from diffuse sources spread over large areas. Over 42% of the agricultural land\narea, or 26% of the total area, of England and Wales is under permanent grassland\n(source: SEISMIC (Hallet et al., 1995) v.2.0.6. software 2000 dataset). Permanent grassland\nis usually maintained as such due to the combination of soil type and climate which\nrenders them unsuitable for arable production. Indeed, of the total agricultural land under\npermanent grassland, approximately 50% occurs on soils with a shallow impermeable\nsubstrate (HOST models H-K (Boorman et al., 1995)). This type of heavy soil frequently\noccurs in western Britain where high levels of rainfall can lead to seasonal water logging\nwhere drainage has not been installed or where it is working inefficiently. These systems\ninclude the dairy pastures of south-west England which are characterised by high levels of\nrainfall and sloping land with high stocking densities making them potentially erosive\nenvironments (Brazier et al., 2007). These areas also receive high levels of nutrients either\nthrough the deposition of animal excreta or through the application of inorganic fertilizers\nand managed manures (Haygarth et al., 2006). As a result they act as significant sources of\ndiffuse pollution i.e. nitrate (NO3-) (Ryden et al., 1984; Haigh and White, 1986; Scholefield\net al., 1993), phosphorus (P) and sediment (Heathwaite et al., 1990; Smith et al., 1995b;\nHawkins and Scholefield, 1996; Haygarth et al., 1998; Bilotta et al., 2008).\nThe majority of studies exploring diffuse pollution in permanent grasslands have\nfocused on sources and behaviours of individual pollutants. However, whilst such research\nprovides vital information on the processes and mechanisms associated with these\nindividual pollutants, a more holistic approach is required in order to provide meaningful\ninformation for implementing policy and remediation options concerned with the health\nof aquatic systems as a whole (e.g.Quinn and Stroud, 2002; Neal et al., 2008). Thus, this\nstudy expands to include a suite of potential pollutants including NO3-, P and sediment,\nbut also other pollutants which have so far received less attention i.e. nitrite (NO2-) and\nammonium\/ammonia (NH4+\/NH3) which are both potentially toxic to aquatic fauna at low\nconcentrations (Lewis and Morris, 1986; Randall and Tsui, 2002). Dissolved forms of\ninorganic and organic carbon (DIC\/DOC) are also recognised to play a significant role in the\nhealth of aquatic ecosystems leading to increased biological oxygen demand within water\nbodies which is potentially detrimental to aquatic fauna (Edwards et al., 2008).\nFurthermore, hydrochemical catchment studies have typically been based on hourly or\nsub-hourly measurements of water fluxes and weekly or monthly chemistry samples\n(Kirchner et al., 2004). Studies which are based on weekly or even lower resolution\nchemical monitoring may miss base flow variation and also most storm events which can\nlead to significant miscalculations of pollutant flux (Johnes, 2007). Storm events are often\nhighly significant in terms of pollutant transfer and Pinoke et al. (1996) reported that the\nmajority of P loss from some catchments occurs during the largest three to five storms in a\nyear. Furthermore, knowledge of the dynamics of pollutant delivery during storm events\ncan potentially highlight changing pollutant sources and the mechanisms of delivery which\nmay not be revealed through infrequent sampling. Therefore higher resolution monitoring\nis vital for defining effective mitigation measures to reduce pollutant loss. Examples of\nhow high temporal resolution series have improved our understanding of hydrochemical\nprocesses are given in Scholefield et al., (2005) where hourly monitoring of riverine\nnutrients revealed marked diurnal patterns occurring during periods of base flow, and\nJordan (2005) where ten minute measurements of total P (TP) in a stream draining a small\nagricultural catchment in Ireland also showed that, although storm events were\nresponsible for major P flushing episodes, cyclical non-storm transfers of TP occurred\nduring base flow.\nThe aim of this study was to monitor the behaviour of a suite of diffuse pollutants\nin a stream draining an agricultural grassland system during a storm event at a temporal\nresolution sufficient to elucidate variations in the chemographs which will improve our\nunderstanding of how pollutants from grassland systems are delivered to surface waters.\nSpecifically, the objectives are to: (1) produce time series of a suite of diffuse pollutants\nwithin a stream draining an intensively managed grassland catchment throughout a\ndiscrete storm event; (2) interpret observed pollutant concentration with respect to\npotential sources; (3) monitor the selected pollutants in surface run-off from a grassland\nfield within the larger catchment to understand better the significance of this source; and\n(4) demonstrate the need for high temporal resolution data to improve flux calculations\nand provide information on diffuse pollutant dynamics and their controls.\n2. Materials and Methods\nStudy Site\nLocated in Devon, England, the Den Brook catchment (UK grid ref. SX 67712 99685) is a\nfirst-order headwater catchment 48 ha in size (Figure 4.1a and b), characterised by a\nslowly permeable seasonally waterlogged clay soil of the Hallsworth series (Harrod and\nHogan, 2008) (Typic Haplaquept (USDA); stagnogley (UK); HOST 24). The catchment\nreceives high levels of rainfall with an annual average of 1050mm (40yr average), the\nmajority of which typically falls in the winter\/spring. However, in recent years it has been\nobserved that heavy rainfall events during the summer months are increasing (Maran et\nal., 2008). The catchment has a limited amount of field drainage installed, predominantly\ndraining areas close to the stream. With this soil type and the associated wet weather\nconditions, the hydrological response to rainfall can be very flashy with a large proportion\nbeing saturation-excess overland flow. The catchment is predominantly managed as\ngrassland sustaining cattle and sheep and the sward is dominated by perennial ryegrass\nreceiving periodic applications of manure, inorganic fertilizer (N, P and K) and excretal\nreturns during the spring\/summer. Within the catchment, there is also a hard-standing\narea with associated animal housing that is served by a slurry lagoon receiving animal\nwaste and contaminated run-off. This area is connected to the Den Brook by a large\ndrainage pipe which intermittently discharges farmyard run-off into the stream. The\nextent of this connection is poorly understood; however, in 2003 the slurry lagoon was\nrebuilt in an attempt to reduce pollution entering the stream. Waste contained within the\nlagoon is spread within the catchment area when ground conditions allow, typically during\nthe spring\/summer. To the south of the catchment a road drain delivers run-off from the\nroad via a concrete conduit.\nDischarge from the catchment was measured using a trapezoidal flume which has\nbeen installed since 2001. Stage height, from which discharge is calculated, is measured\non 5 minute time-steps by a pressure transducer in a stilling well, 1m upstream of the\nflume and is recorded by a data logger (Campbell Scientific CR10X). Precipitation is\nrecorded at the catchment outlet by a tipping-bucket rain gauge (Rain-wise Bar Harbor,\nME), which records the total number of tips per minute (each tip equivalent to 0.254mm\nprecipitation). Within the catchment, a single field has been defined as a sub-catchment\nand is also monitored for flow. This field at the west of the catchment (Fig. 1b) represents\n12% of the catchment area and slopes at about 5\u00b0 from its SW to NE corner. The field is\nbounded on its upslope sides to the south and west by earth banks forming hedges (~1m\nhigh) while on its down slope sides only livestock fencing exists. However, on these sides\nsmall earth banks (~15cm high) have developed, possibly as a result of the field\u2019s recent\nhistory; it had been ploughed and used for maize production until 2006, when it was\nreturned to grassland. This field, like the majority of the land within the catchment away\nfrom the stream channel, has no field drainage installed, and subsurface flow is\nconsidered to be negligible due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil (<10mm\nday-1) (Armstrong and Garwood, 1991). Due to the nature of the slope and the presence of\nsurrounding banks, all surface run-off is contained and directed towards the NE corner of\nthe field. In this corner a \u2018V\u2019 notch weir was installed in 2006\/07. All surface flow occurring\nwithin this field is channelled down to the weir and discharge is calculated from the stage\nheight measured by a stilling-well and ISCO 6712 auto-sampler, integrated bubbler\nmodule (Teledyne Isco Inc, Nebraska, USA).\nFigure 4.1. Maps showing the location of (a) the Den brook catchment in the south west U.K.\nand (b) the Den brook catchment and the field sub-catchment along with their associated\nsampling points.\nAt the time of the study the regional weather pattern had been highly convective\nproducing large volumes of rainfall in highly localised areas. Monitoring in the catchment\nwas set up in order to capture one such event, ideally with both a base flow and a storm-\nflow element. On the 2nd June 2008 a large storm event occurred that produced over\n13mm of rainfall in 3 hours and at its most intense 8mm falling in 30 minutes.\nSample Collection and Analysis\nSamples were collected from both sample points using ISCO automated pump samplers\nwhich had depth-integrated inlets, thus samples were taken from throughout the water-\ncolumn. The auto-samplers were started shortly before a storm event was forecast and\nprogrammed to sample on 30 minute time-steps. The internal clocks of the two auto-\nsamplers were synchronised prior to sampling. Samples were collected from the field\nwithin 24 hours of the first sample being collected or on the same day as sampling was\ncompleted. Samples were immediately refrigerated in the laboratory while still stored in\ntheir original plastic ISCO sample bottles and chemical analysis was conducted within a\nUKAS accredited laboratory. On the same day as the samples were collected subsamples\nfor TP and filtered TP were taken and stored in autoclavable glass digestion bottles, the\nlatter being filtered through a 0.45\u00b5m cellulose nitrate filter paper (Whatman) prior to\nstorage. Samples were also analysed for NO2--N on the same day as they were collected.\nAnalysis for NH4+-N and total oxidised nitrogen (TON) was carried out within 48 hours of\nsample collection whilst analysis for suspended solids (SS), volatile sediment (VS), DIC and\nDOC were completed within one month.\nThe method used to determine TP concentrations was an acid persulfate digestion\nof the sample using a method adapted from Eisenreich et al.(1975). Phosphate was then\ndetermined colourimetrically on a spectrophotometer (Cecil Instruments, Cambridge, UK).\nValues of filtered TP were subtracted from TP to give values for >0.45\u00b5m TP. This fraction\nhas been operationally termed particulate P (PP), while the <0.45\u00b5m fraction has been\ntermed soluble P (SP). However, it is recognised that the SP value represents all forms of P\nthat are <0.45\u00b5m, which can include colloids and bacteria as well as \u2018truly\u2019 soluble P.\nNitrite-N concentrations were determined colourimetrically, after filtration through a\n0.45\u00b5m PES filter (Chromacol, Welwyn Garden City, UK), by segmented flow analysis\n(Bran+Luebbe Autoanalyzer3, Norderstedt, Germany) using the\nsulphanilamide\/naphthylenediamine method (Henricksen and Selmer-Olsen, 1970).\nAnalysis for NH4+ and TON was carried out colourimetrically on a continuous flow analyser\n(CFA; Skalar, Breda, The Netherlands). Ammonium-N was determined through the\nIndophenol reaction (Searle, 1984). Total oxidised nitrogen was determined after\nhydrazine sulphate reduction to NO2--N and subsequent\nsulphanilamide\/naphthylenediamine analysis (Henricksen and Selmer-Olsen, 1970). The\ndifference between TON and NO2--N was considered to be NO3--N. Forms of dissolved\ncarbon were determined on samples filtered through a 0.45\u00b5m cellulose nitrate filter\npaper (Watman) using a FormacsHT Combustion TOC analyser (Skalar, The Netherlands)\nthrough oxidation in a quartz reactor at 950\u00b0C containing cobalt oxide, where all forms of\ncarbon are oxidised to carbon dioxide (CO2). Dissolved inorganic carbon is determined\nthrough digestion of the sample in orthophosphoric acid at room temperature to\ndecompose all inorganic carbon forms to CO2. The CO2 produced in each case is measured\nwith an infrared detector. Dissolved organic carbon is taken to be the difference between\ntotal dissolved carbon (TDC) and DIC. Suspended solids were determined through the\nvacuum filtration, and a subsequent drying at 105\u00b0C, of a known sample volume through a\npre-weighed GF\/F filter paper (Whatman), with particle size retention of 0.7\u00b5m. Filter\npapers were then heated to 500\u00b0C to determine the total residual ash. The difference\nbetween SS and total ash is considered to represent VS (UK Standing Committee of\nAnalysts, 1980).\nCalculation of Pollutant Loads\nThe pollutant loads were calculated using linear interpolation of point concentration data\nfollowed by multiplication with the corresponding Q data. Loads for the catchment were\ncalculated from the point at which increased Q occurred through to the end of water\nsampling 18 hours 25 minutes later. Although at this point both chemistry and Q values\nhad not yet reached base flow levels, values were very low compared to during the event\nsuch that further losses were minimal. Loads were calculated using the 30 minute sample\ndataset and also on a sample set artificially reduced to represent samples collected at 60\nminute intervals. Loads for the field sub-catchment were calculated from the time that the\nfirst sample was taken until insufficient Q meant no further samples could be collected.\nBecause Q was initiated at 16:05, and the first sample was taken at 16:30, no load can be\ncalculated for the first 25 minutes and therefore loads calculated from the field sub-\ncatchment are underestimated.\n3. Results\nHydrological Response\nFigure 4.2 shows the rainfall measured close to the catchment outlet and the hydrographs\ngenerated from both the catchment outlet (Figure 4.2a) and the monitored field (Figure\n4.2b) within the catchment. These hydrographs present discharge (Q) as uncertain\nhydrographs (Qmax and Qmin) through a technique developed by (Krueger et al., 2008)\nbased on estimates of the errors associated with the calibration technique (Bilotta et al.,\n2008). A centre Q line has been plotted through this uncertainty interval to give a clearer\nvisual indication of the nature of the flow response. The values of Q cited, or parameters\nrelated to Q, are the centre value with the uncertainty interval. The uncertainty interval is\npresented in parentheses following this value i.e. Q (Qmin-Qmax).\nA 2.5 hour period of base flow (about 1.9l s-1) was monitored before the onset of\nincreased Q at the catchment outlet which occurred at 14:25, 20 minutes after the onset\nof rainfall and after 5.6mm had fallen on the catchment. Peak Q reached 61l s-1 (52-70) at\n17:10, 2 hours 45 minutes after the onset of increased Q and after 14mm of rain had\nfallen on the catchment which accounted for 96% of the rainfall received over the study\nperiod; once rainfall had stopped, Q began to recede. On the rising limb of the hydrograph\na small subsidiary peak occurred at 15:05, 40 minutes after the onset of increased Q. Here\nthe peak Q was 19l s-1 (14-24) before receding to 16 l s-1 (11-20) over a 20 minute period,\nQ subsequently increased to its maximum value. Surface flow generated from the field\nsub-catchment was initiated at 16:05, 2 hours after the onset of rainfall \u2013 some 1 hour 40\nminutes later than the catchment outlet. The maximum Q was 3.4l s-1 (2.9-4.0) and\noccurred at 17:00, 55 minutes after the initial generation of flow and roughly coincidental\nwith the peak discharge at the catchment outlet. Surface flow then decreased until its\ncessation at 03:35 the following morning. The subsidiary hydrograph peak that appears on\nthe rising limb of the main catchment hydrograph preceded the onset of the field sub-\ncatchment hydrograph.\nIf it is assumed that the rainfall measured at the catchment outlet represents the rainfall\nover the whole catchment then the total volume of water deposited was 6748m3. The\nbase flow over the 3 hours immediately prior to the storm event was 6.9m3 hr-1 (1.8-12)\nand the volume of water leaving the catchment from the point at which Q increased after\nthe onset of rainfall until sampling ceased was 1260m3 (949-1572). The volume of water\nfrom the catchment outlet less base flow is therefore calculated to be 1132m3 (915-1349)\nand gives a runoff coefficient of 17% (14-20). Again, assuming even rainfall across the\ncatchment, the total water deposited on the field sub-catchment was 796m3. The volume\nof water that left the field via surface flow was 23m3 (16-29) giving a runoff coefficient of\n2.9% (2.1-3.7).\nChemical Variation\nThe data obtained for the chemical response in drainage derived from the catchment as a\nwhole are presented in Table 4.1, while Figure 4.3 shows the chemographs of the\nvariation in concentration presented alongside Q from the catchment outlet (Figure 4.3a)\nand field outlet (Figure 4.3b). Base flow concentrations are presented as a mean and two\nstandard errors in parentheses.\nFigure 4.2.

As Q rapidly increased, so NO3--N concentrations rapidly decreased such\nthat within 35 minutes of the onset of increased Q, NO3--N concentrations were below\nanalytical quantification (<0.18mg N l-1). Concentrations of NO3--N only became\nanalytically detectable again at 17:30, after Q had peaked and continued to rise\nthroughout the duration of the falling limb of the hydrograph. Concentrations measured\nfrom the field sub-catchment were all below quantifiable levels (<0.18mg l-1).\nConcentrations of NO2--N in the catchment base flow averaged 92 (\u00b1 5)\u00b5g l-1 and\nfollowed a similar trend to that of the NO3--N chemograph with concentrations falling\nrapidly (to about 8\u00b5g l-1) with the onset of increased Q and gradually increasing as Q\ndecreased. However, unlike NO3--N concentrations of NO2--N remained initially low once Q\nhad peaked and did not start to increase for about 3 hours. One anomaly exists in the\ndata, which corresponds to the peak Q, whereby a value close to pre-storm\nconcentrations occurs.\nConcentrations of NO2--N in the surface flow from the field sub-catchment ranged\nbetween 2 and 6\u00b5g l-1 and did not appear to show any temporal variation during the\nperiod of flow from the field weir.\nAmmonium\nAmmonium-N concentrations in the catchment base flow were largely below levels which\ncould be quantified analytically (<0.26mg l-1). Concentrations of NH4+-N remained low\nthroughout the majority of the storm and unlike NO3--N and NO2--N did not show any\ntemporal variation over the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph. However, two\nsample points were substantially higher in concentration than the rest of the storm. These\nconcentrations of 14.3 and 2.87mg l-1 corresponded to the occurrence of the subsidiary\npeak on the rising limb of the main hydrograph. The duration of the spike in NH4+-N\nconcentrations lasted for 90 minutes before concentrations fell back below levels which\nwere analytically quantifiable. In contrast, concentrations of NH4+-N measured in surface\nflow from the field sub-catchment were always below analytical quantification (<0.26mg N\nl-1).\nSuspended and Volatile Solids\nConcentrations of SS in base flow from the catchment outlet averaged 9 (\u00b1 0.5)mg l-1 of\nwhich VS comprised 43%. During the storm event, concentrations of SS and VS rose to\nmaximum concentrations of 925 and 387mg l-1 respectively. These maxima both occurred\non the subsidiary hydrograph peak. A small secondary peak in SS concentrations was\nobserved after the initial spike in concentrations; however, a corresponding secondary\npeak in VS concentrations was not apparent. Concentrations of both SS and VS declined\nthroughout the remainder of the rising limb of the main hydrograph such that at peak Q,\nconcentrations of SS and VS were already reduced to 103 and 25mg l-1 respectively.\nConcentrations of both SS and VS continue to decline over the duration of the falling limb.\nWith the onset of increased Q, despite concentrations of both SS and VS\nincreasing, the relative contribution of VS fell from a base flow value of 43% to 18%, and\nalthough this increased back to 42% on the subsidiary hydrograph, levels decreased\nimmediately after to ~ 25% throughout the remainder of the rising limb. Throughout the\nduration of the falling limb, although both SS and VS concentrations decreased, the\nrelative contribution of VS began to increase reaching pre-storm levels before the study\nhad been concluded.\nConcentrations of SS and VS measured in the field sub-catchment Q did not appear\nto show any temporal variation and averaged 15.3 (\u00b1 0.6) and 8.2 (\u00b1 0.6)mg l-1\nrespectively. The relative contribution of VS was larger than that observed at any point\nfrom the catchment outlet, averaging 54% of the SS.\n15\nTable 4.1.

During the storm event,\nconcentrations of PP and SP remained broadly similar to one another, reaching maximum\nconcentrations of 5947 and 5870\u00b5g P l-1 respectively. These maxima were both reached\non the subsidiary peak. However, while PP increased dramatically with the onset of\nincreased Q, increases in SP appeared to be slightly delayed. Concentrations of PP rapidly\nreduce after their maximum to 1957\u00b5g P l-1 over the next 30 minutes, coinciding with the\ntrough between the subsidiary hydrograph and the remainder of the rising limb. It then\ncontinued to decrease at a slower rate throughout the remainder of the rising limb of the\nmain hydrograph. Similarly concentrations of SP also decreased on the rising limb of the\nhydrograph after their initial peak, although the reduction in concentrations was more\nrapid than that of PP. Although PP and SP both continued to decrease generally over the\nduration of the hydrograph falling limb, both appear to have small increases in\nconcentration occurring over a 1-2 hour period with the apparent increase in SP occurring\nshortly after peak Q.\nIn base flow, the relative contribution of PP to TP was ~ 60%. However, with the\nonset of increased Q, due to the lag in the increase in SP concentrations, this rose to 88%.\nOn the subsidiary hydrograph peak, where both PP and SP maximum concentrations\noccurred, the relative contributions of PP and SP were equal, while over the remainder of\nthe main rising limb PP tended to be the more dominant fraction. However, after peak Q\noccurred, SP initially became the more dominant fraction, coinciding with the secondary\nSP concentration peak, before pre-storm levels of contribution were achieved.\nConcentrations of PP and SP in surface flow from the field were far smaller than\nthose in the stream during the storm event at 177 (\u00b1 7) and 216 (\u00b1 11)mg P l-1 respectively.\nWhile concentrations of SP appeared to show no variation over time, concentrations of PP\n17\nappeared to decline slightly over the period from ~ 200 to 160mg P l-1. This trend leads to\na slight decline in the contribution of PP to TP over the period from ~ 50% to 45%.\nCarbon\nConcentrations of DIC and DOC in the catchment base flow were comparable at 11 (\u00b1 0.1)\nand 8.7 (\u00b1 0.6)mg l-1 respectively. Although neither DIC nor DOC concentrations were\naffected immediately by the onset of increased Q, both DIC and DOC rapidly increased in\nconcentration in association with the subsidiary hydrograph peak (58 and 248mg l-1\nrespectively) before concentrations decreased throughout the rest of the main\nhydrograph rising limb (12 and 36mg l-1 respectively). Concentrations of DOC rose slightly\nafter peak Q had been reached (43mg l-1) before declining gradually thereafter to 21mg l-1\nsome 14 hours later. Concentrations of DIC however, rose gradually after peak Q had been\nreached from 12 to 16mg l-1 at the cessation of sampling. The relative contribution of DOC\nto TDC increased with the onset of increased Q and was at its maximum at the peak Q of\nthe subsidiary hydrograph (81%). After this DOC comprised 75% of the TDC throughout\nthe remainder of the hydrograph rising limb and, due to the contrary tends in DIC and\nDOC concentrations over the falling limb, the proportion of DOC reduced from 76 to 58%.\nConcentrations of DIC and DOC measured in the surface flow from the field sub-\ncatchment both increased over time. Concentrations of DIC increased from 11 to 17mg l-1,\nwhile DOC concentrations increased from 23 to 29mg l-1 however these concentrations\nwere less than those observed at the catchment outlet during the storm.\n4. Discussion\nCatchment Base Flow\nConcentrations of chemical parameters in base flow (Table 1) have been assessed in terms\nof documented acceptable limits and the data reported from a long term study using\nweekly grab samples from this sample site (Jarvie et al., 2008). Concentrations of NH4+-N\n18\nand SS were within the range of values previously reported from this catchment and well\nbelow levels specified by the EU (0.78 and 25mg l-1 for respectively) (European Economic\nCommunity, 1978) The concentration of NO3--N was also well below the 11.3mg l-1 level\nset out by the European Union for identifying waters designated as \u2018nitrate vulnerable\nzones\u2019 (NVZ\u2019s) (European Economic Community, 1991) and comparable to those reported\nin this catchment for this time of year and those reported in a nearby river system\ndraining land of equivalent soil type and management (Scholefield et al., 2005). While\nNO3--N is typically perceived to be the species of N with most environmental relevance\nwithin grassland systems it would appear that NO2--N may be more environmentally\nsignificant. While NO2--N may only account for a small proportion of the total inorganic N\npresent (~ 4%), it is highly toxic to aquatic fauna and the concentrations measured were\nan order of magnitude higher than European acceptable limits (European Economic\nCommunity, 1978). The concentrations measured were larger than those reported in this\ncatchment previously and those reported elsewhere in river water (Scholefield et al.,\n2005) but consistent with reports from Northern Ireland that have shown that\nconcentrations of NO2--N within certain river systems draining grassland catchment can be\nlarge and frequently in the range of 100 to 150\u00b5g l-1 (Smith et al., 1995a).\nConcentrations of PP and SP in base flow were also large, but within previously\nreported ranges, with mean values of 107 (\u00b1 9) and 74 (\u00b1 6)\u00b5g P l-1 respectively. These\nconcentrations can be considered large as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment suggests that eutrophication problems can be triggered by TP\nconcentrations of 35 to 100\u00b5g l-1 (OECD, 1982) while the EU cite threshold values of 65\nand 130\u00b5g P l-1 for salmonid and cyprinid waters respectively (European Economic\nCommunity, 1978). Interestingly, TP was evenly apportioned between PP and SP which\nwas an unexpected finding as it is generally considered that P losses from grassland are\ndominated by SP, especially during periods of base flow (Sharpley and Rekolainen, 1997;\nHouse and Warwick, 1998). However, there is growing discussion on this subject (Bilotta\net al., 2007, Brazier et al., 2007).\n19\nNO2-\n0\n50\n100\nN\nO\n2-\n-N\n(\uf06d\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n60\n120\nNH4+\n0\n50\n100\nN\nH\n4+\n-N\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n8\n16\nPP\nC\nat\nch\nm\nen\ntQ\n(l\ns-\n1 )\n0\n50\n100\nPP\n(\uf06d\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n4000\n8000\nSP\n02\/06\/2008 03\/06\/2008 04\/06\/2008\nC\nat\nch\nm\nen\ntQ\n(l\ns-\n1 )\n0\n50\n100\nS\nP\n(\uf06d\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n4000\n8000\nSS\n0\n50\n100\nS\nS\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n500\n1000\nVS\n02\/06\/2008 03\/06\/2008 04\/06\/2008\n0\n50\n100\nV\nS\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n250\n500\nNO3-\nC\nat\nch\nm\nen\ntQ\n(l\ns-\n1 )\n0\n50\n100\nN\nO\n3-\n-N\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0.0\n1.5\n3.0\nDIC\n0\n50\n100\nD\nIC\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n50\n100\nDOC\n02\/06\/2008 03\/06\/2008 04\/06\/2008\n0\n50\n100\nD\nO\nC\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n200\n400\nNO3\n-\nFi\nel\nd\nS\nub\n-c\nat\nch\nm\nen\ntQ\n(l\ns-\n1 )\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nN\nO\n3-\n-N\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nNO2-\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nN\nO\n2-\n-N\n(\uf06d\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n20\n40\nNH4+\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nN\nH\n4+\n-N\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nPP\nFi\nel\nd\nS\nub\n-c\nat\nch\nm\nen\ntQ\n(l\ns-\n1 )\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nP\nP\n( \uf06d\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n250\n500\nSS\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nS\nS\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n25\n50\nVS\n02\/06\/08 03\/06\/08 04\/06\/08\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nV\nS\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n25\n50\nSP\n02\/06\/08 03\/06\/08 04\/06\/08\nFi\nel\nd\nS\nub\n-c\nat\nch\nm\nen\ntQ\n(l\ns-\n1 )\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nS\nP\n(\uf06d\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n250\n500\nDIC\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nD\nIC\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n25\n50\nDOC\n02\/06\/08 03\/06\/08 04\/06\/08\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\nD\nO\nC\n(m\ng\nl-1\n)\n0\n25\n50\na\nb\nFigure 4.3. Chemographs of the diffuse pollutant temporal dynamics at (a) the catchment outlet\nand (b) the field sub-catchment. Discharge is plotted as only the centre line of the uncertainty\nenvelope for visual clarity.\n20\nThere is little information in the literature about the evolution of DIC and DOC\nfrom intensively managed grasslands due generally to the perception that such systems\nyield little carbon. In general the DOC concentrations of \u2018uncoloured\u2019 streams range\nbetween 2 and 10mg l-1 while concentrations in \u2018organically coloured\u2019 streams may range\nfrom 3 and 50mg l-1 (Malcolm, 1993). The values measured in this study support these\nprevious findings and those reported previously within this catchment for DOC.\nHydrological Response\nBoth hydrographs demonstrate the rapid, flashy response of the catchment to rainfall,\nespecially at the intensity experienced, due to the heavy clay nature of the soil type.\nDischarge from the catchment outlet started to increase rapidly 20 minutes after\nthe onset of an intense period of rainfall and increased from 2 (0.6-3.6) to 61 (52-70)l s-1\nover a 2 hour 45 minute period. Discharge from the field sub-catchment was initiated 2\nhours after the onset of rainfall with the lag time representing the period needed for the\nfield to wet-up sufficiently to generate surface and subsurface flow. Both catchment and\nsub-catchment peak Q occur almost simultaneously indicating that most of the catchment\nQ is derived from the grassland area that makes up the majority of the catchment with the\ndelayed response time between the onset of increased Q from the catchment and from\nthe field sub-catchment representing a period of wetting-up and in-field storage. The\nhigher runoff coefficient of the catchment compared to the field sub-catchment probably\nreflects the contribution of near-channel areas as well as the contribution of other\npathways such as field drainage and preferential flow pathways. The subsidiary peak\npresent on the main catchment hydrograph rising limb responded sufficiently quickly, and\nwas short-lived enough, for a recession limb to have started to occur before the rest of the\ncatchment response led to the remainder of the rising limb of the main hydrograph. The\npresence of a greatly increased NH4+-N concentration points to the fact that the subsidiary\nhydrograph represents the contribution of the hard standing area within the catchment,\nwhich is dominated by the presence of animal manures. The results suggest that the\n21\nimpermeable surface of the hard standings offered a near immediate run-off response\ninitiated by the period of intense rainfall, channelled through a concrete pipe, with a\nsimilarly rapid fall in Q once rainfall had ceased. The remainder of the catchment exhibited\na more buffered response, which allowed the individual hydrological signal from the hard\nstanding to be observed. With an area of 4744m2, the volume of water deposited on the\nhard standings would have been 66m3. The volume of water represented by the subsidiary\nhydrograph peak, less base flow, is calculated to be 35m3 (26-45) giving a runoff\ncoefficient of 53% (40-67). This value may underestimate the true runoff coefficient of the\nhard standings as it is not possible to resolve the full extent of the subsidiary hydrograph\nfalling limb.\nCatchment Chemographs\nConcentrations of NO3--N responded negatively with Q producing a characteristic\nchemograph whereby soil microbial NO3--N is diluted by rainwater. This response in NO3--\nN concentrations has been reported elsewhere (Webb and Walling, 1985; Armstrong et\nal., 1999; G\u00e4chter et al., 2004) and is typical of systems where rainwater moves quickly\nover or through the soil thus having only limited opportunities for the diffusion of NO3--N\nfrom soil water to storm event water. The storm water in effect dilutes the base flow NO3-\n-N leading to a rapid decrease in concentration. While it has been shown that a seasonal\neffect can be observed in NO3--N evolution chemographs, with increased concentrations\noccurring with increased Q during the summer, in cases where intense rainfall occurs a\ndilution effect is still expected (Webb and Walling, 1985). If the NO3--N in the drainage was\nsourced from fertilizer N applications, then the opposite effect might be expect to occur\nwith an increase in NO3--N concentrations associated with increased Q as storm runoff\nwashes material off the soil and into the stream. This type of transfer has been previously\nstudied in relation to P losses (Haygarth and Jarvis, 1999; Preedy et al., 2001; Withers et\nal., 2003) and has been termed \u2018incidental\u2019 transfer and while there is no specific\ndefinition of incidental losses they have been described as \u201cdirect losses from fertilizers or\n22\nmanures soon after application to land perhaps when coincident with a rainstorm\u201d\n(Haygarth and Jarvis, 1999). In practical terms incidental mobilisation describes the\nunpredictable losses of source materials that are initially separate to the soil.\nNitrite-N produced a similar chemograph to that of NO3--N and, although no other\nchemographs of NO2--N concentrations during a storm event at this resolution could be\nfound, it would seem likely they would be similar to NO3--N chemographs. This is because\nNO2-, like NO3-, is a highly soluble anion, formed within the soil system and held within the\nsoil water and is therefore subject to the same mobilisation and transport processes as\nNO3-. The one data anomaly, which corresponds to the peak Q, cannot be explained but is\nprobably erroneous and therefore should be ignored. As with NO2--N, the literature\nprovides little information on the chemographs of NH4+-N concentrations from grassland\ncatchments at high temporal resolution and is a determinand generally ignored. However\nit might be predicted that concentrations would be very low and unaffected by Q.\nAlthough the NH4+ cation is soluble, that which is formed through the mineralisation of\nsoil organic matter, or enters the soil system from the excreta of grazing animals, will be\nretained by the negatively charged clay-humus particles within the soil before being\nrapidly nitrified to NO3-. Therefore, the leaching and drain flow losses of NH4+-N would\ntend to be small (Watson et al., 2000; Hatch et al., 2004). This is the case at the catchment\noutlet, with concentrations of NH4+-N below analytical quantification (<0.26mg l-1)\nthroughout the majority of the storm and unchanged from base flow levels. However, the\nconcentration of NH4+-N shows a spike co-incident with the subsidiary hydrograph and\nexceeds levels permitted by the European Union for water supporting freshwater fish\n(0.78mg l-1) (European Economic Community, 1978). As was the case with the NO2--N\nconcentrations, this spike in concentration could be anomalous, however this is not\nbelieved to be the case for three reasons; i) it is not a single datum point, but consists of\ntwo elevated data points, ii) the two samples were visually different to the other storm\nevent samples, being dark in colour, and had a noxious smell and iii) the timing of the\nconcentration spike coincided with the subsidiary hydrograph. The occurrence of the\n23\nconcentration spike with the subsidiary hydrograph is characteristic of an incidental loss\nand a recent review by Hatch et al. (2004) has highlighted the importance of such losses of\nNH4+-N on water quality. Ammonium-N entering ditches and drains from the uncontained\nrun-off from farmsteads, the leachate from field heaps of solid manure, and summer\nstorms washing manure and fertilizer from the field surface are all highlighted as\nsignificant routes of transfer.\nAs with the NH4+-N, all the other pollutants in this study have concentration spikes\nassociated with the subsidiary hydrograph. However, while it may be reasonable to\nassume that all NH4+-N was sourced from the hard standing area within the catchment,\nsuch a conclusion cannot be made about PP, SP, SS, VS, DIC and DOC. These potential\npollutants taken individually or as a suite may very well characterise the response\nexpected when animal manures enter a water body, however unlike NH4+-N their\npresence in the catchment is not restricted to one specific area. The rapid run-off from the\nhard standings could have mobilised these pollutants from other source areas such as\nexposed soil along the line of connectivity between the hard standings and the stream or\nfrom the stream channel itself. Despite this, it seems very likely that there was a\ncontribution from manure material sourced from the hard standings in the stream\nassociated with the subsidiary hydrograph peak.\nThe contribution of pollutant losses associated with the hydrological response of\nthe hard standings masks the contribution of the grassland on the rising limb of the main\nhydrograph and it is not possible to resolve the two contributing areas without some form\nof tracing experiment. However, there is an indication of a second smaller peak in\nconcentration in some of the chemographs (Fig 4.3a. SP, SS and DOC). The concentrations\nof SP indicate the presence of a second peak which corresponds to the main hydrograph\npeak and appears to represent a more subtle Q-related SP contribution. Concentrations of\nSS exceed the 25mg l-1 limit set by the European Union for rivers supporting fresh water\nfish (European Economic Community, 1978) throughout the majority of the hydrograph\nand also appear to have a second, more sharply defined, peak after the main spike\n24\nalthough PP concentrations do not exhibit a corresponding secondary peak, perhaps\nindicating that the second SS peak has a high proportion of P deficient sediment within it.\nWhile a second smaller peak in DOC concentration, also associated with the main\nhydrograph peak, is also suggested by the data the same cannot be said of DIC; the\nconcentration of which continued to rise throughout the storm event. The nature of the\nresponse of carbon and other pollutants from the multiple source areas within the\ncatchment is clearly complex. To understand better the relative contribution of these\nareas and pathways requires further investigation and highlights a role for tracers to\nimprove understanding of diffuse pollution from agriculture (Granger et al., 2007).\nField sub-catchment Chemographs\nChemographs of chemistry plotted against Q from the field sub-catchment give the reader\nsome idea of the nature of the response generated from an agricultural grassland.\nHowever, it should be noted that the field studied was managed differently to the rest of\nthe catchment, in that livestock were excluded and there was a good herbage cover crop\nin place at the time of the rainfall event.\nIn general, pollutant concentrations did not vary over the period of flow\ngeneration with the exceptions being PP, DIC and DOC. The response was not surprising\nfor NO3--N, NO2--N and NH4+-N as these exist within the soil profile contained in soil water,\nand not on the soil surface, therefore limiting potential interactions with surface run-off.\nFurthermore, given that the field had no animals or amendments for over a month prior\nto the storm event, it would seem unlikely that these forms of N would be present in\nsurface flow in the form of an incidental transfer. Similarly, SP may be considered to be a\nconstituent of soil water and not readily accessible to surface flows. However it is possible\nthat some proportion of PP transported by surface flows may move into solution leading\nto an apparent SP response (House et al., 1998). Particulate P appeared to decrease\nslightly with decreasing Q. This is in keeping with the literature which indicates that PP\nconcentrations require the hydraulic energy of rainfall and surface run-off to mobilise\n25\nsediment and its associated P. In contrast, SS did not appear to decrease over time. While\nthis might not be surprising given the management of the field at the time, it might also\nbe expected that PP should also demonstrate no relationship with Q, although there is\nconsiderable uncertainty in the link between PP and SS (Krueger et al., 2008). The reason\nfor this disparity is unclear but it might be that the analytical resolution of SS\nconcentrations at these low levels was unable to reveal any underlying relationships with\nQ. Apart from PP, dissolved carbon was the only other determinand to show any temporal\nvariation. There is little evidence in the literature reporting grassland DOC concentrations.\nHowever, a study investigating DOC losses from grazed grasslands under different\nmanagements found that concentrations in flow from undrained plots decreased over the\nwinter period and were larger in plots which had received inorganic N (11-47mg l-1) when\ncompared with plots which had received none (7-31mg l-1). Concentrations of DOC from\ndrained plots which had received the same fertilizer N management did not show a\ndecrease with time and were similar in concentration, however, peaks in DOC\nconcentration coincided with periods of high rainfall (McTiernan et al., 2001).\nConcentrations of DOC measured in surface run-off from the grassland were in broad\nagreement with those reported in this study.\nPollutant Loads\nTable 4.2 contains the calculation of pollutant load from the catchment outlet based on\nthe 30 minute sample frequency undertaken within the study and also the calculated\nloads based on two artificially depleted 60 minute sample set with samples removed on\nthe hour and half hour respectively. Despite the relatively short duration of the event, the\ntwo 60 minute pollutant loads showed considerable variation when compared with the 30\nminute sample set. Loads calculated from 60 minute sample set (I) were generally under-\nestimated with the greatest underestimation associated with NH4+-N (-35%) with DIC flux\nunder-estimated the least (-4%). The total load of NO3--N was found to be unaffected,\nbeing over-estimated by 1%, while NO2--N was overestimated by 12%. A more detailed\n26\nbreakdown of the total load during different periods of the drainage event is presented in\nFigure 4.4. Estimates of load from the catchment outlet were made for each pollutant\nexported during; i) the subsidiary hydrograph up to the end of its receding limb, ii) the\nremainder of main hydrograph rising limb, and iii) the main hydrograph falling limb. The\nchange in sampling resolution typically has little effect on the calculation of load on the\nfalling limb of the hydrograph, ranging from +9.9% for NO2--N to -4.1% for NO3--N, with\nmost pollutant fluxes being over estimated by no more than 3%. The main deviation in\nload between 30 and 60 minute sample data (I) occurs on the rising limb, and more\nspecifically the subsidiary hydrograph. Over this period loads were over estimated for NO2-\n-N (57%) and NO3--N (206%) and underestimated for all other pollutants. The degree of\nunderestimation ranged from just -58% for DIC up to -82% for NH4+-N.\nConversely, loads calculated using the 60 minute sample set (II) was generally\nunder-estimated. Again, the greatest error occurred associated with NH4+-N (25%) while\nthe total load of NO3--N was unaffected and NO2--N was underestimated by 3%. Again, the\nfalling limb of the hydrograph accounted for little of this error (1.8% to -4.2% for SS and\nNO2--N respectively) with the rising limb dominant however errors associated with the\nsubsidiary hydrograph was not solely responsible. Over estimations with the 60 minute\nsample set (II) were more evenly apportioned between the subsidiary hydrograph and the\nmain hydrograph rising limb for SS, VS, PP, SP, DIC and DOC, while the main rising limb\naccounted for a 75% overestimation for NH4+-N.\n5. Conclusions\nIt is clear from the data presented in this paper that catchments dominated by intensively\nmanaged grassland systems have the potential to be a significant source of a range of\ndiffuse pollutants. Within the study catchment base flow concentrations of P (both as PP\nand SP) and NO2--N were found to be environmentally significant while during storm flow\n27\nTable 4.2 Loads calculated for the field sub-catchment and the catchment based on 30 minute sample frequency and uncertain\nhydrographs.

Both NO3--N and NO2--N concentrations were observed to decrease in a\nmanner that was typical of rainwater dilution indicating that both were derived from within\nthe soil. Other pollutants, both particulate and soluble, were observed to increase with\nincreased discharge. A subsidiary hydrograph which occurred on the main hydrograph rising\nlimb appeared to be a response to rapid run-off from farm building and hard standings\nwithin the catchment. This conclusion was reached due to a significant increase in NH4+-N\nconcentrations which occurred in association with the subsidiary hydrograph peak.

This is because\nthese pollutants could have been sourced elsewhere in the catchment in addition to the\nhard standings and merely mobilised by the increased discharge. However, the delayed\nhydrological response of the field sub-catchment relative to the catchment outlet would\nindicate that the catchment was still in the process of wetting up while the spike in\npollutants was occurring at the catchment outlet. This would suggest that the spike in\npollutant concentrations could only have been sourced from the hard standings, from within\nthe stream channel, or from areas proximal to the stream channel.\nConcentrations of pollutants in the surface flow from the field sub-catchment were\nlower than those observed at the catchment outlet and did not show the same degree of\ntemporal variation with the exception of DIC and DOC the concentration of which increased\nover time. The clearly complex nature of the pollutant\/discharge dynamics of this relatively\nsmall first order stream catchment highlights the need to understand better the role of\ndifferent source areas and pathways in pollutant delivery to water bodies.\nWithin this study, the 30 minute sampling strategy adopted was only just sufficient to\ncapture the significant incidental pollution event associated with the subsidiary hydrograph.\nAn hourly sampling strategy may not have captured the concentration dynamics associated\nwith this small subsidiary hydrological event. Calculated pollutant loads were also severely\naffected by a reduction in sample frequency such that in the worse case loads of NH4+-N\ncould have been underestimated by 35% or over estimated by 25% depending on when\nhourly samples were collected. Typically loads calculated on the falling limb of the\nhydrograph were not greatly affected with most errors occurring on the rising limb and\nmore specifically on the subsidiary hydrograph which was associated with an incidental\ntransfer of pollutants.\nWhile the findings presented in this paper are useful they are limited to one small\ncatchment and one storm event. To better understand multi-pollutant dynamics there is a\nneed to monitor more storms of different magnitudes and during different seasons, and on\ndifferent catchments with contrasting soil types and land uses. This short study also\nhighlights the need to understand better the source areas and pathways from which\npotential pollutants become entrained. These may be better understood through the use of\n30\nnovel tracing techniques to discriminate between the different source areas, and to\nhighlight the pathways by which pollutants are transported.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper arises from research funded by Department of the Environment, Fisheries and\nRural Affairs (project PE0120).
