Ionosphere (Ionosphere-magnetosphere interac-\ntions; Plasma convection) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (Mag-\nnetotail)\nCorrespondence to: A. Grocott\n(a.grocott@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe concept of twin-vortex \u201cDungey-cycle\u201d magnetospheric\nconvection has been understood for many years (e.g. Dungey,\n1961). Typically during intervals of southward IMF, re-\nconnection at the dayside low-latitude magnetopause causes\nclosed terrestrial field lines to become connected into the so-\nlar wind, adding open flux to the polar caps. This flux is\ntransported anti-sunward at high-latitudes over the northern\nand southern polar caps by the flow of the solar wind, into the\ntail lobes. Here it convects equatorwards, ultimately recon-\nnecting again in the central plasma sheet, becoming closed\nonce again. This newly closed flux then convects back to\nthe dayside at lower-latitudes via dawn and dusk completing\nthe twin-vortex convection pattern with which we are famil-\niar. The physical process by which the tail component of this\nreconnection cycle occurs is often associated with magneto-\nspheric substorms (Hones, 1979; Farrugia et al., 1993; Baker\net al., 1996; Nagai et al., 1998). Although the finer details\nof causality during substorms are still highly debated, it is\ngenerally accepted that substorms are responsible for a large\nfraction of magnetotail flux transport (Hones, 1979; Baker\net al., 1996). This is often observed to occur in the form\nof bursty bulk flows (BBFs) (Baumjohann et al., 1990; An-\ngelopoulos at al., 1992, 1994) or rapid flux transport events\n(RFTs) (Scho\u00a8del et al., 2001a, b) which are essentially lo-\ncalised, transient, packets of fast moving magnetic flux.\nThe nature of the twin-vortex convection excited in the\nionosphere in association with the onset and expansion phase\nof magnetospheric substorms has been demonstrated by Gro-\ncott et al. (2002) and Provan et al. (2004). Macroscale con-\nvection features associated with isolated BBFs have also\nbeen investigated by Grocott et al. (2004a) and Nakamura et\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1710 A. Grocott et al.: Magnetotail flux transport during IMF-northward non-substorm intervals\nal. (2005a) during intervals of relative quiet preceding major\nsubstorm expansions. In addition, a new mode of large-scale\nmagnetotail flux transport which appears to dominate during\nintervals of northward, but BY -dominated IMF, has been ob-\nserved in HF ionospheric radar data as reported by Grocott et\nal. (2003, 2004b, 2005). This takes the form of highly asym-\nmetric Dungey-cycle twin-vortex convection, with bursts of\nfast azimuthal flow in the midnight sector accompanying in-\ntervals of modest flux closure. Grocott et al. (following ear-\nlier work by Sandholt et al., 1998a, b) suggest that dayside\nreconnection equatorward of the cusp persists during such in-\ntervals of intermediate IMF clock angle (in addition, perhaps,\nto high-latitude reconnection usually associated with north-\nward IMF), and that this drives a moderate convection cycle\nwhich is not sufficient to trigger magnetospheric substorms.\nMilan et al. (2005) coined the term \u201ctail reconnection during\nIMF-northward, non-substorm intervals\u201d (TRINNIs) to de-\nscribe this phenomenon, which recurs on timescales of tens\nof minutes, and acts to balance the low-level open flux cre-\nation at the dayside. The lack of associated substorm signa-\ntures such as geosynchronous particle injections and global\nauroral expansions implies that that this reconnection is oc-\ncurring at a more distant neutral line, rather than the near-\nEarth neutral line which is activated at substorm onset.\nThe dependence of the orientation of TRINNI flows on\nIMF BY , as well as the interhemispheric asymmetry which\nthey display, has led several authors (including Nishida et\nal., 1995, 1998; Grocott et al. 2004b, 2005) to suggest a\nmechanism for their generation based on the idea of magnetic\nfield reconfiguration following reconnection in a twisted\ntail. This follows earlier work by Taguchi (1992), Taguchi\net al. (1994), Taguchi and Hoffman (1996) who reported\nMagsat observations of IMF BY -controlled field-aligned cur-\nrents near the midnight auroral oval and associated DE-2\nobservations of azimuthal plasma convection. Essentially,\nthe effect of prolonged exposure to significant IMF BY is\nto introduce an azimuthal separation between the Northern\nand Southern Hemisphere footprints of a reconnecting tail\nfield line, such that newly reconnected flux would have to\ntravel faster in one hemisphere to convect, via dusk or dawn,\nback to the dayside. It is proposed that this is what then\ngives rise to the fast bursts of flow observed in the night-\nside ionosphere, however, no in-situ magnetospheric obser-\nvations have yet been reported which support this idea. In\nthis paper, in-situ observations of magnetotail flux transport\nfrom the Cluster spacecraft are presented along with simul-\ntaneous ground-based radar observations of the large-scale\nionospheric flow. It is revealed that TRINNIs are associated\nwith bursty bulk flows, but ones which have a significant az-\nimuthal velocity component matching that of the large-scale\nconvection evident in the ionosphere. Furthermore, in-situ\nobservations from either side of the tail current sheet reveal\nconvective flow with opposite azimuthal sense. This provides\ncompelling evidence for a twisted tail containing field lines\nwhich are aligned significantly out of a meridian plane, lend-\ning weight to the proposed mechanism by which this new\nmode of magnetospheric convection transports flux in the\ntail.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe observations discussed in this paper were made during\ntwo intervals: 21:50\u201322:20 UT on 14 August 2004 (hence-\nforth referred to as I-1) and 00:55\u201301:25 UT on 17 Septem-\nber 2005 (henceforth referred to as I-2). In-situ magneto-\ntail observations were made by the Cluster spacecraft during\nboth intervals. The Composition and Distribution Function\nAnalyzer (CODIF) sensor and the Hot Ion Analyser (HIA)\nof the Cluster Ion Spectrometry (CIS) instrument (Re`me et\nal., 2001) provided ion velocity data for the events, and mag-\nnetic field data were provided by the fluxgate magnetometer\n(FGM) (Balogh et al., 2001). The positions of the space-\ncraft in the magnetosphere at the midpoint of each interval\n(22:05 UT for I-1 and 01:10 UT for I-2) are illustrated in\nFig. 1a. The top panel shows the geocentric solar magnetic\n(GSM) x-z plane, the middle panel shows the x-y plane and\nthe bottom panel shows the y-z plane. In all three panels\nCluster 1 (black) lies on the solid field line for I-1 and the\ndashed field line for I-2. These field lines are the T-96 model\nfield lines (Tsyganenko, 1995). Spacecraft 2\u20134 (red, green\nand blue, respectively) have had their positions relative to\nCluster 1 expanded (by a factor of 10 for I-1 and 2 for I-2)\nfor clarity.\nMeasurements of ionospheric convection from both inter-\nvals were provided by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Net-\nwork (SuperDARN) radars (Greenwald et al., 1995). Super-\nDARN is an international collaboration of HF radars located\nin the auroral regions of both hemispheres, which provide\nroutine observations of the horizontal ionospheric plasma\nflow. The flow measurements made during both intervals\ndiscussed here are thus used to infer the large-scale nature\nof magnetospheric-ionospheric convection via the derivation\nof large scale maps of the high-latitude convection using the\n\u201cMap Potential\u201d model (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998). This\ntechnique involves the mapping of line-of-sight radar veloc-\nity measurements onto an equal area polar grid and using\nthem to determine a solution for the electrostatic potential,\nexpressed in spherical harmonics up to sixth order. The\nequipotentials of the solution represent the plasma stream-\nlines of the modelled convection pattern. Information from\nthe statistical model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996),\nparameterised by concurrent IMF conditions, is used to sta-\nbilise the solution where no data are available. A Heppner-\nMaynard boundary, determined from the line-of-sight veloc-\nity data, is also used to constrain the convection pattern at\nlower latitudes (Heppner and Maynard, 1987; Shepherd and\nRuohoniemi, 2000).\nFigures 1b\u2013c show the fields-of-view of SuperDARN plot-\nted for I-1 at 22:05 UT in the Northern and Southern\nAnn.

The locations\nof the radars are indicated by the filled black circles. The\nNorthern Hemisphere scan is from the Iceland East radar (E)\nat 22:10 UT and the Southern Hemisphere scan is from the\nSyowa East radar (N), a few minutes later at 22:14 UT. The\ndata are colour coded according to the colour bar at the bot-\ntom such that green and blue data represent positive Doppler\nvelocities, i.e. plasma moving towards the radar, and red and\nyellow data represent negative Doppler velocities, i.e. plasma\nmoving away from the radar. Superposed on these data are\ncontours of the ionospheric electric potential (equivalently\nstreamlines of plasma flow) derived using data from the full\ncomplement of SuperDARN radars via the Map Potential\ntechnique. The Cluster footprints from Fig. 1 are also shown\non the Northern Hemisphere map for reference.\nThe plasma streamlines, which give an indication of the\nlarge-scale nature of the flow, reveal a number of impor-\ntant features. Firstly, they reveal that the large-scale flow\nis asymmetric about the noon-midnight meridian. Secondly,\nthey reveal that this asymmetry has an opposite sense in\neach hemisphere. Thirdly, they reveal that the sense of the\nflow in the midnight sector is azimuthal; east-west in the\nNorthern Hemisphere and west-east in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere. Looking at the line-of-sight data on which the\nstreamlines are superposed reveals additional information\nabout the macroscale nature of the flows. They are quite\nclearly locally enhanced, i.e. of order 1000 m s\u22121 in both\nhemispheres (the red and blue patches of scatter). They also\nexhibit a clear reversal (yellow to blue in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere and green to red in the Southern Hemisphere). This is\nconsistent with the flows transitioning from open to closed\nfield lines (discussed further in Sect. 4) with the TRINNI\nflows generally considered to be the low-latitude enhance-\nment to the \u201creturn flow\u201d of closed flux. Looking at the data\nfrom \u223c10 min either side also reveals that these enhanced\nfeatures are transient and bursty (discussed in more detail in\nSect. 4). These observations are consistent with the char-\nacteristics of IMF BY -negative TRINNIs which have been\nreported in previous studies.\nThe concurrent IMF conditions for this interval are sum-\nmarised in Fig. 3a, which shows the 3 components of the\nlagged ACE magnetic field data (BX: blue, BY : green and\nBZ: red) between 21:50 and 22:20 UT. This shows that the\ninterval was one of northward, but negative BY -dominated\nIMF, which is consistent with the orientation of the TRINNI\nflows described above. The corresponding in-situ magneto-\nspheric observations from the Cluster spacecraft are shown in\nFigs. 3b\u2013c. Panel (b) shows the GSM X and Y components\nof the full flow vector and of the magnetic field perpendicular\ncomponent of the flow. The latter were calculated by rotating\nthe CIS CODIF data into a magnetic field oriented coordinate\nsystem (determined using the FGM data), removing the field\nparallel component, then rotating back into GSM. The result-\ning data are then a good representation of convective motion\nof magnetic flux. The FGM data (in GSM coordinates) are\nshown in Fig. 3c.

This\nenhancement was in a duskward direction, the same as the\ndirection of the TRINNI flows in the Northern Hemisphere\nionosphere (Fig. 2a). The corresponding (but smaller) en-\nhancement in VY reveals that the plasma was indeed accel-\nerated in a duskward direction, although the magnetic field\ngeometry was such that it was the field-perpendicular com-\nponent of the flow which had the most significant azimuthal\nsense. BY also showed some variability, with a positive en-\nhancement occurring a few minutes prior to the enhancement\nto the flow followed by a negative enhancement coincident\nwith the peak flows. It is difficult to comment on the signif-\nicance of these signatures, but it seems reasonable that there\nmight be some fluctuations in the azimuthal component of\nthe magnetic field close to the reconnection site in an asym-\nmetric tail.\nAt 22:07 UT (iii) all 3 components of the magnetic field\ndropped to zero in association with a change in sign of V\u22a5X\nand V\u22a5Y which suggests that Cluster moved tailward of a re-\nconnection X-line. AlthoughBZ barely went negative, which\nit might have been expected to do for a simple X-line geom-\netry, it did become less positive (dropping below the T-96\nmodel field value). This is consistent with the idea that the\nlocal reconnection geometry was in fact somewhat complex.\nTowards the end of the interval, in association with the end of\nthe observed flow enhancement at \u223c22:13 UT (iv), BZ had\nlevelled off in line with the T-96 model field, approximately\n5 nT above its pre-interval value.\n3.2 Interval 2: 17 September 2005 (00:55\u201301:25 UT)\nFigure 4 shows a single scan of Northern (a) and Southern\n(b) Hemisphere SuperDARN line-of-sight data in the same\nformat as Fig. 2.

The Cluster footprints from\nFig. 1 are also shown; Clusters 2 and 4 are shown on the\nNorthern Hemisphere map and Cluster 3 is shown on the\nsouthern map (because Cluster 3 is south of the neutral sheet,\nas will be discussed below). Because the coverage of data\nfrom any one radar is not as good for this interval as it was\nfor I-1, scans from a number of radars are shown on the same\nmap: Iceland East (E), Iceland West (W), and Goose Bay (G)\nfor the Northern Hemisphere and Halley (H) and Sanae (D)\nfor the Southern Hemisphere. These data are sufficient to de-\nrive potential patterns which have similar characteristics to\nthose of I-1, i.e. large-scale flow that is asymmetric about the\nnoon-midnight meridian, azimuthal in direction and with an\nopposite sense in each hemisphere. This asymmetry is re-\nversed relative to I-1, however, being west-east in the North-\nern Hemisphere and east-west in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe more localised low-latitude bursty element to the flow\npatterns are again revealed by the line-of-sight data.

It is possible\nthat a lack of data in the post-midnight sector in this case is\ncontributing to the lack of asymmetry in the derived potential\npattern.\nFigure 5 presents the ACE and Cluster data for this inter-\nval in the same format as that shown in Fig. 3.

It should be pointed out that owing to\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1709\u20131720, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1709\/2007\/\nA. Grocott et al.: Magnetotail flux transport during IMF-northward non-substorm intervals 1715\ndegradation of the CODIF sensor the data shown for Clus-\nter 3 is from HIA. Unfortunately, Cluster 4 has no work-\ning HIA instrument and therefore a like-for-like comparison\ncan not be made. However, the coincident observation of\nenhanced earthward flows of a few 100 km s\u22121 by different\nsensors on each spacecraft implies that, at least on the larger\nscale, they are both observing the bulk plasma motion.\nThese enhanced flows were accompanied by a perturba-\ntion in BZ beginning at 01:02 UT (i) (peaking at\u223c5 nT after\n10 min). Although there is a less significant enhancement\nduring this interval than was observed during I-1, the general\ntrend up to (iii) is that of an increase. Interestingly, how-\never, although there were enhancements in V\u22a5Y at the time\nof the BBF there was no such enhancement in VY . This im-\nplies that the net motion of the plasma (field-aligned + field-\nperpendicular) was earthward, but that the convective mo-\ntion of the flux did have an azimuthal component. Consider\nCluster 4, which observed a positive BX component and was\ntherefore above the neutral sheet, the same as for I-1. The en-\nhancement in V\u22a5Y in this case was in a dawnward direction,\nthe same as the direction of the TRINNI flows in the North-\nern Hemisphere ionosphere (Fig. 4a). However, looking at\nthe BX component measured by Cluster 3 reveals that the\nspacecraft was below the neutral sheet. Here, flows with an\nopposite V\u22a5Y were observed, in apparent agreement with the\nduskward sense of the flows observed in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere ionosphere. These observations imply that, although\nthe flow itself was earthward at the location of the spacecraft,\nthe convective motion of the magnetic field had an azimuthal\ncomponent which was opposite in the two hemispheres. In-\ndeed, looking at BY , although the overall sense is positive (as\nexpected for a twisted tail under positive IMF BY (Nishida et\nal., 1994)), smaller-scale perturbations between (i) and (ii)\nalso have the opposite sense between Cluster 3 and 4.\n4 Discussion\nThe radar data presented above are consistent with previous\nobservations of non-substorm transient convection enhance-\nments in the nightside high-latitude ionosphere (e.g. Grocott\net al., 2003). This enhanced convection is understood to re-\nsult from bursty nightside reconnection associated with mod-\nest solar wind driving at the dayside magnetopause during\nintervals of northward, but BY -dominated, IMF. These bursts\nof \u201ctail reconnection during IMF-northward, non-substorm\nintervals\u201d, (TRINNIs) are characterised not only by their\nionospheric flows, but also by the lack of accompanying\nauroral and geosynchronous signatures. Energetic electron\ndata, for example, from the Los Alamos National Laboratory\n(LANL) spacecraft (not shown) reveal no sign of injection\nsignatures during either interval discussed here. A number of\nauroral datasets (not shown) also confirm that neither inter-\nval is associated with typical substorm activity.

The locations of Cluster 3 and\n4 (from I-2) are also indicated in (c) (not to scale) by the green and\nblue filled circles, respectively.\nGreenland (Friis-Christensen et al., 1985) networks, for ex-\nample, reveal enhancements in the auroral electrojets of only\na few tens of nanotesla and negligible low-latitude Pi-2 band\n(20\u2013200 s) activity. The magnetic field continuation method\nof Amm and Viljanen (1999) provides values of the asso-\nciated field-aligned currents of \u223c100 mA m\u22121 which, when\ncombined with electric field measurements from the radars\nof \u223c50 mV m\u22121 suggests auroral conductivities of just a few\nS. Auroral imagery from the wideband imaging camera on\nthe far-ultraviolet instrument onboard the IMAGE satellite\n(Mende et al., 2000a, b) also reveals no significant auro-\nral breakups, although some small, localised, brightenings at\n\u223c70\u25e6 magnetic latitude during I-1 are apparent. These may\nwell be related to poleward boundary auroral intensifications\n(PBIs) or arc \u201cbifurcations\u201d (Lyons et al., 1999) and auroral\nstreamers (Henderson et al., 1998) which have been shown\nto occur commonly under a wide variety of conditions, both\nduring \u201cquiet\u201d times and during substorms. Why these auro-\nral forms should be present during only one of the intervals\ndiscussed here and not be common to all BBF-type activity is\nan interesting question, but is beyond the scope of the present\nstudy.\nThe primary significance of the observations discussed in\nthis paper then, is that they show that TRINNIs, previously\nobserved only in the ionosphere, have a distinct and identi-\nfiable signature in the magnetosphere. They have revealed\nthat, at least in some cases, TRINNIs are associated with\nbursty bulk flows and, more significantly, that the azimuthal\nsense of the large-scale flow observed by SuperDARN may\nalso be present on a smaller scale in the magnetosphere. In\norder to better visualise the implications of these observa-\ntions consider the illustration in Fig. 6, which depicts the\ngeometry involved in the tail for 3 different scenarios, as\nviewed looking onto the Earth from the tail.

Figure 6a\nshows field lines which are symmetrical about the midnight\nmeridian, as might be expected, for example, for IMF BY =0.\nA spacecraft located at the position of the black circle would\nthen be expected to observe dawnward convection. In Fig. 6b\nthe tail field lines are twisted out of meridian planes by the\npersistence of negative IMF BY prior to reconnection (see\ne.g., Nishida et al., 1998; Grocott et al., 2005; Milan et al.,\n2005). The thick arrowed curves then show the direction of\nthe TRINNI flow bursts in the ionosphere. The field lines\nand flow bursts are coloured according to whether they re-\nconnected post- (green) or pre- (red) midnight, thus forming\neither a Northern Hemisphere (westward) or Southern Hemi-\nsphere (eastward) TRINNI. In this case, a spacecraft located\nat the position of the black circle would observe duskward\nconvection, as was the case in I-1, described above. Finally,\nFig. 6c shows the case for I-2, where the twisting of the tail is\nthat due to positive IMF BY . The locations of Cluster 3 and\n4 are now indicated on the figure (not to scale) by the green\nand blue filled circles respectively. The opposite senses of\nBX observed by the two spacecraft during the interval con-\nfirms that they were on opposite sides of the current sheet and\nthe opposite senses of V\u22a5Y that they observed, along with the\ncorresponding ionospheric observations in each hemisphere,\nimply their locations on oppositely moving field lines.\nNow, consider the relationship between the ionospheric\nand magnetospheric manifestations of TRINNIs in more de-\ntail. Whilst it is apparent that they can agree in broader\nterms, their time-dependence does not appear to be identi-\ncal. Signatures of BBFs in the magnetosphere are intrinsi-\ncally short lived, lasting of order \u223c10 min. In the ionosphere\nthe electric field enhancements associated with TRINNIs de-\nvelop over longer timescales. To aid discussion of this tem-\nporal evolution, time-series data summarising the observa-\ntions of Figs. 2\u20135 are presented in Fig. 7 for I-1 (21:50\u2013\n22:40 UT) and I-2 (00:55\u201301:45 UT). These intervals have\nbeen extended slightly from those displayed in Figs. 3 and\n5 to illustrate the persistence of the radar signatures beyond\nthe times of the Cluster data displayed previously. V\u22a5Y from\neach interval is reproduced in panels (a1) and (a2) for refer-\nence. Panels (b\u2013e) show range-time-velocity SuperDARN\ndata from the radar beams indicated in the corresponding\npanels of Fig. 1. The colour coding of the radar data is as\nin Figs. 2 and 4, though it is perhaps worth pointing out that\nthe data presented from I-1 are from oppositely directed radar\nbeams than that from I-2 (see Fig. 1), such that the east\/west\nsense of the blue\/red colour scale is effectively reversed for\nthe two intervals.\nLooking first at I-1, the Northern Hemisphere flow burst\nfrom Fig. 2a is clearly evident in the data shown in Fig. 7b.\nThe enhanced westward (blue) flows can be seen to have\ndeveloped 2\u20134 min after the onset of activity in the tail (i),\nin concert with the peak in flux transport (ii). This flow\nenhancement continued, however, until at least 22:24 UT,\nwith all evidence of the enhancement not disappearing un-\ntil \u223c22:34 UT, some 20 min after the end of the BBF signa-\nture. Now consider the corresponding Southern Hemisphere\ndata presented in panel (c) which shows the flow burst from\nFig. 2b. In this case, the enhanced eastward (red) flows in the\nSouthern Hemisphere do not appear to have developed until\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1709\u20131720, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1709\/2007\/\nA. Grocott et al.: Magnetotail flux transport during IMF-northward non-substorm intervals 1717\nafter all evidence of the magnetospheric enhancement had\nsubsided (iv). A gap in the coverage of SuperDARN scat-\nter prior to this point might well be responsible for some of\nthe apparent delay, although the enhanced flows in this case\npersist for longer than their Northern Hemisphere counter-\npart. A lack of consistency between the timing of Northern\nand Southern Hemisphere flow bursts is not unexpected how-\never, since they are not geomagnetically conjugate and are\nnot, therefore, constrained to occur simultaneously (Grocott\net al., 2005). Turning to the summary for I-2, the Northern\nHemisphere data shown in Fig. 7d reveal a clear patch of fast\neastward (blue) scatter centred on (ii), which appears\u223c5 min\nafter the onset of the eastward flow in the magnetosphere, as\nevidenced by the Cluster 4 data (the blue curve in panel a2).\nInterestingly in this case, the enhancement was short lived\n(\u223c5 min), although the flows became enhanced again after\n01:30 UT, in concert with Cluster 4 observing an additional\nenhancement in V\u22a5Y (now westward, since the spacecraft\nhad moved below the neutral sheet). Finally, the Southern\nHemisphere data for this interval, plotted in panel (e), also re-\nveals enhanced flow signatures which persist throughout this\nextended interval. In this case, however, the first evidence of\nfast westward (red) flow occurs at \u223c01:00 UT, slightly prior\nto the first magnetospheric signatures being observed. Ad-\nditional enhancements at \u223c01:16, \u223c01:25 and 01:35 UT are\nalso apparent.\nTwo possible explanations exist for this lack of consis-\ntency between the magnetospheric and ionospheric observa-\ntions. One is that there are propagation effects resulting in\nthe flows which are initiated in the magnetosphere not be-\ning experienced in the ionosphere for some finite time. An-\nother is that the reconfiguration of the tail which is evident\nin the ionosphere is related to a larger-scale magnetospheric\nevent than previous studies of BBF suggest, or that multi-\nple quanta of smaller-scale magnetospheric events are occur-\nring and that Cluster is only observing one such contribu-\ntion. In fact, it is likely to be a combination of both temporal\nand spatial effects. In theory, the minimum time delay be-\ntween a magnetospheric disturbance being observed in the\nionosphere is limited by the Alfve\u00b4n speed, which is sensitive\nto variations in the magnetic field strength and plasma den-\nsity and therefore difficult to integrate along any given field\nline. Nakamura et al. (2005b) compared the Cluster obser-\nvations from our I-1 with those from the Double Star (Liu\net al., 2005) TC-1 spacecraft, located \u223c9RE downtail, and\nfound no discernable signature of the dipolarisation front this\nclose to the Earth. It is possible, however, that the signif-\nicant azimuthal component of the disturbance could be re-\nsponsible for the delay between the BBF signature at Clus-\nter and ground-based observations made at an earlier local\ntime. This can be investigated by considering, for example,\nthe time at which the ionospheric signature of the BBF was\nobserved by the MIRACLE ground magnetometer network\n(as discussed by, e.g., Amm and Kauristie, 2002). MIRA-\nCLE was located about 1000 km to the west of the mapped\nlocation of the Cluster spacecraft during I-1 and observed\nthe signature of the BBF at 22:12 UT, some 8 min after the\npeak signature observed by Cluster. This translates to a prop-\nagation speed of \u223c2 km s\u22121, which is comparable to values\ndiscussed by Amm and Kauristie. At this speed, however, it\nwould have taken twice this time for the same BBF to have\npropagated into the premidnight sector where the peak radar\nflow enhancement was observed (Fig. 2a). This suggests that\neither the BBF has a much larger azimuthal extent than previ-\nously thought, or that a number of BBFs are occurring across\nthe tail within the timescale of the TRINNI.\nAdditional information about the relationship between the\nlarger-scale TRINNI activity observed by SuperDARN and\nisolated BBFs observed locally by Cluster is revealed by con-\nsideration of the associated reconnection rates and flux trans-\nport. Estimates of total flux closure and associated night-\nside reconnection rates for TRINNIs have been determined\npreviously, for example, by Grocott et al. (2003) and Mi-\nlan et al. (2005, 2006) to be \u223c0.1\u20130.2 GWb and \u223c35 kV, re-\nspectively. These estimates were based on large-scale iono-\nspheric observations from auroral and radar data. Estimates\nof the in-situ flux transport associated with BBFs have been\ndetermined by Angelopoulos et al. (1994) and Scho\u00a8del et\nal. (2001a) to be \u223c2\u00d7106 WbR\u22121E . If BBFs are responsi-\nble for transporting all the flux closed in a typical TRINNI,\nthen this implies either a 100RE scale size for the BBFs in\nquestion, or that a large number of localized BBFs contribute\nto the large-scale convection. The latter is more probable,\nsince the timeframe of observations of BBFs is of the order\nof 10 min, whereas TRINNI activity has been observed to last\nfor in excess of an hour (e.g. Milan et al., 2006). Grocott et\nal. (2004a) compared in-situ measurements of flux transport\n(at similar levels to those observed by Angelopoulos et al.,\n1994, and Scho\u00a8del et al., 2001a) made by Cluster to observa-\ntions of the ionospheric flow perturbation associated with an\nisolated BBF. They observed a localised ionospheric voltage\nenhancement of \u223c10 kV which, over the \u223c10 min duration\nof the event corresponds to \u223c6\u00d7106 Wb. If this enhance-\nment was due solely to the action of the BBF then this would\nimply a scale size of \u223c3RE in the magnetosphere which is\nmore consistent with previous observations (e.g. Sergeev et\nal, 1990, 1996; Angelopoulos et al., 1997; Kauristie et al.,\n2000; Nakamura et al., 2001).\nIn order to make a similar comparison for the events stud-\nied here, the criterion of Scho\u00a8del et al. (2001a) is used to\ndefine the horizontal electric field EH (Eq. 1), which is then\nintegrated between (i) and (iv) from Fig. 3 (and (i) and (iii)\nfrom Fig. 5) to find the flux transport per RE , 8H :\n8H =\n\u222b tiv\nti\nEH \u00b7 dt =\n\u222b tiv\nti\n\u221a\n(VXBZ)\n2 + (VYBZ)2 \u00b7 dt (1)\nThis yields values of 2.25\u00d7106 WbR\u22121E (at Clus-\nter 1) and 2.86\u00d7106 WbR\u22121E (at Cluster 4) for I-1 and\n1.11\u00d7106 WbR\u22121E (at Cluster 3) and 3.10\u00d7106 WbR\u22121E (at\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1709\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 1709\u20131720, 2007\n1718 A. Grocott et al.: Magnetotail flux transport during IMF-northward non-substorm intervals\nCluster 4) for I-2. These values are again comparable to\nthose reported by Angelopoulos et al. (1994) and Scho\u00a8del et\nal. (2001a). The electric field measured in the ionosphere,\ncorresponding to flows of \u223c1000 m s\u22121, is \u223c50 mV m\u22121.\nThis is a factor of 10 greater than the local electric field\nassociated with the BBF, presumably resulting from the\nconvergence of field lines in the ionosphere. By putting\nan upper limit on the width of the flow channels in the\nionosphere (from Figs. 2 and 4) of \u223c500 km this then\nimplies a scale size for the BBF in the magnetosphere of\n\u223c1RE . It also implies an associated ionospheric voltage\nof \u223c25 kV which is consistent with the studies discussed\nabove. However, the fact that the ionospheric flows persist\nsignificantly longer than the BBF timescale implies that\nthere are likely to be multiple BBFs contributing to the\noverall large-scale convection.\n5 Summary\nAzimuthal bursts of flow in the nightside, high-latitude iono-\nsphere which have previously been associated with \u201ctail re-\nconnection during IMF-northward, non-substorm intervals\u201d\n(TRINNIs) by Grocott et al. (2003, 2004b, 2005) and Mi-\nlan et al. (2005), have been observed in concert with sig-\nnatures of flux transport in the magnetosphere. These mag-\nnetospheric signatures resemble Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs)\nor Rapid Flux Transport events (RFTs) as described by An-\ngelopoulos et al. (1994) and Scho\u00a8del et al. (2001a), taking\nthe form of \u223c10 min timescale bursts of \u223c800 km s\u22121 earth-\nward flow in the central plasma sheet. Atypically however,\nthese BBFs also revealed some azimuthal asymmetry, which\nmatched that of the TRINNI flows observed in the iono-\nsphere. Observations from opposite sides of the neutral sheet\nalso revealed convective flows with opposite azimuthal direc-\ntion. This was consistent with interhemispheric observations\nof the ionospheric flow, corroborating the idea that TRIN-\nNIs are formed by the effect of reconnection on field lines\nwhich have been twisted out of meridian planes by the pene-\ntration of IMF BY into the tail. Values of flux transport asso-\nciated with these bursts of reconnection have been calculated\nto be \u223c2\u00d7106 WbR\u22121E , compared to values of ten times this\nover similar timescales in the ionosphere, suggesting a lack\nof one-to-one correlation between BBFs and the large-scale\nconvection associated with TRINNIs. Time-series analysis\nof the ionospheric data confirms this to be the case, indicat-\ning that the flows can persist for in excess of 30 min after the\nmagnetospheric signatures subside. This implies that multi-\nple, localised, quanta of magnetospheric flux transport con-\ntribute to the overall large-scale convection which is evident\nin the ionosphere.\nAcknowledgements.
