Introduction \nThe feasibility of using an OSL scanning technique to determine the cumulative absorbed \ndose for single inclusions embedded in sliced ceramic samples has been demonstrated in \nprevious work (Bailiff and Mikhailik, 2003). The application of this approach to dating \nmeasurements with archaeological ceramic samples on a grain-by-grain basis is of interest in \ncases where, for example, only a small fragment is available or where the distribution of \nlithogenic radionuclides in the sample matrix is heterogeneous. The general problem of \nconfinement of the measured luminescence to a very small proportion of grains has been long \nrecognised (Huntley and Kirkey, 1985) and this undermines a basic assumption of the method \nif the radiation field due to radionuclides of lithogenic origin within the sample is strongly \nnon-isotropic. Elements of the methodological approach developed by Aitken and Wintle \n(1977; also Aitken, 1985, in respect of the measurement of a value) for dating slices of calcite \nand flint are relevant, although not directly applicable to single grains in ceramic slices. The \naim of the experiment was to investigate whether bright grains were present in brick samples \nand, if so, to apply a regenerative procedure using the OSL scanner to determine the \npalaeodose for individual grains. The slices of ceramic examined were cut from bricks that \npreviously had been dated using disaggregated HF-etched quartz inclusions for which \ndeterminations of the palaeodose were available for comparison. \n \n2. Experimental  \n2.1 Samples \nSlices were extracted from two brick cores (refs 294-17 and 304) that had been obtained as \npart of an on-going programme of dating of a group of English late medieval buildings. These \nsamples were selected because of their bright OSL signals and the high experimental \nprecision obtained in the measurement of the palaeodose. Using a diamond wafering blade, \n 3\nslices of 1 mm thickness were cut from brick rods of ~15 mm length (~ 10 mm x 12 mm in \ncross-section) that had been encapsulated in a cold-setting resin. After removal of the resin by \nimmersion in a solvent, the slices were fastened to machined stainless steel plates using a \ncyanoacrylate glue. All preparation was performed under subdued red lighting conditions and \nexposure to (red) light was kept to a minimum to avoid optical bleaching of the exposed \nsurfaces. No further polishing or treatment of the surface was undertaken. \n \n2.2 Instrumentation \nSpatially resolved OSL measurements with the slices were performed using an OSL scanner \nthat is based on the system described previously (Bailiff and Mikhailik, 2003). The \ndistribution of OSL is obtained within an area of 10 mm x 10 mm based on data from 1600 \nmeasurement points when using a step size of 250 \u03bcm. The optical stimulation beam is \ndirected onto the sample surface at a constant angle (~ 45\u00ba) after passing through an \nelectronically controlled shutter, selected optical filters and a beam-focusing lens. In these \nexperiments the sample was moved under the path of the beam in a stepwise manner; after \neach incremental move, the shutter was opened for a selected stimulation period (e.g., 200 \nms) during which the sample was exposed to the laser beam and the OSL recorded.  \n \nThree types of optical stimulation source were used: a constant wave (CW) source provided \nby the output of an Ar-ion laser (Reliant 250D, Laser Physics) operated in multi-line mode \n(488\/514 nm lines dominant); a CW 850 nm laser diode (Laser 2000) and a pulsed diode-\npumped solid-state laser (YAG:Nd; Laser 2000) that was frequency doubled to provide \nemission at 532 nm. The laser beam spot diameter at the sample position was adjusted to ~250 \n\u03bcm using the knife-edge technique to measure the intensity profile. The beam intensity and \nposition were monitored using a silicon photodiode with a pin-hole aperture placed in the \n 4\nsample position, and the power was adjusted either by regulation of the laser power or by \noptical attenuation of the beam.  \n \nThe luminescence was detected by an EMI 9635QA PMT after passing through a Schott U-\n340 filter (6 mm), the signal from the PMT anode was passed via a fast charge-sensitive \npreamplifier and discriminator to a multi-channel scalar (MCS), as described previously \n(Bailiff and Mikhailik, 2003). When using the pulsed laser stimulation source, a time-window \ndiscriminator (Redut Ltd) and dual-channel MCS (FAST Comtec GmbH) were substituted for \nthe corresponding elements in the above configuration to distinguish prompt (< 1 \u03bcs) and \ndelayed (>1 \u03bcs) recombination luminescence detected following the arrival of each laser pulse \n(Bailiff and Mikhailik, 2003). OSL measurements for disaggregated quartz grains were \nperformed using a Ris\u00f8 DA 12 semi-automated reader (Ris\u00f8 National Laboratory) under \noptical stimulation with blue LEDs.  \n \nAbsorbed doses were administered to grains located on stainless steel discs using the standard \n90Sr\/90Y irradiator mounted on the reader, the dose-rate from which had been calibrated \nagainst a secondary photon source (60Co; G\u00f6ksu et al., 1995) at the GSF Secondary Standards \nDosimetry Laboratory (SSDL). Slices were irradiated using a beta irradiator (Bailiff, 1980), \ncontaining a similar type of 90Sr\/90Y beta source, the spatially-resolved dose-rate from which \nwas calibrated with quartz grains that had been irradiated with a known dose (1 Gy) by a 60Co \nsource at the GSF SSDL, as discussed further below.  \n \n2.3 Procedures for the measurement of absorbed dose  \nThe absorbed dose to both disaggregated grains and grains within the surface of slices was \ndetermined following an OSL single aliquot regenerative procedure (Bailiff and Holland, \n 5\n2000) that is similar to that described by Murray and Wintle (2000) and which included the \nmonitoring and correction of sensitivity change due to sensitization effects. Increases in OSL \nsensitivity are generally slight for samples of this age and type since the palaeodose \n(typically1-2 Gy) and the temperatures, TP, used in the preheat treatment are sufficiently low \nto avoid the onset of significant sensitization. Unless stated otherwise, the beta doses \nadministered ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 of the estimated palaeodose, P. The preheating procedure \napplied to slices (holding the sample at 220\u02daC for 10s) was selected after examination of the \nposition of the palaeodose plateau (P vs TP) obtained with disaggregated quartz grains from \nthe same sample and taking into account the effects of thermal lag. \n \n2.4 Spatially \u2013resolved calibration of beta source dose-rate \nThe beta source dose-rate to quartz grains in the sub-surface of 1 mm-thick slices of ceramic \nwas measured using single grains of quartz irradiated with a dose of 1 Gy at the GSF SSDL. \nThe latter were distributed in an array of shallow holes cut into the surface of a slice of \nceramic tile prepared for use in calibration. A regenerative procedure using scanning \nmeasurements was applied to obtain the absorbed dose (units of time) at each location where a \nsufficiently bright grain was detected. Using these data, the measured dose-rate to 90-150 \u03bcm \ndiameter single grains located in the central region of the sub-surface of the 1 mm-thick \nceramic slice was 1.02\u00b10.07 Gy min-1. The relative variation of the measured source dose-rate \nwith radial distance in the sub-surface plane is shown in Fig. 1 for measurement points within \none half of the irradiated area. It compares well with that predicted by Monte Carlo \nsimulations performed for this particular irradiation geometry using the MCNP code (Forster \net al., 2004), although the source dose rate in one quadrant of the irradiated area showed a \nstronger reduction with radial distance and this is to be investigated in more detail. Monte \nCarlo simulations of beta particle transport were also performed to obtain the dose-depth \n 6\nprofile in a 1 mm-thick ceramic slice for the specific irradiation conditions. The relative \nspatial variation in source dose-rate is also similar to that observed experimentally by Spooner \nand Allsop (2000) who used the same type of  silver plaque source.  \n \n3. Results \n3.1 Single grains in brick slices \nThe OSL data were collected in two consecutive scans to optimise the signal-to-noise ratio. \nRegions of bright emission were identified by producing contour plots of the recorded photon \ncounts (obtained using either 514 nm or 850 nm radiation). Fig. 2 shows an example of an \nOSL contour map obtained with sample 294-17-S4, and the corresponding photographic \nimage of the slice is shown in Fig. 3. Visual inspection and correlation of the two images at \nmacroscopic and microscopic levels was performed to identify the sources of luminescence \nevident in the OSL map. For example, a grain of ~500 \u03bcm diameter highlighted in Fig. 3 can \nbe correlated with a region of relatively intense OSL emission in the contour plot (Fig. 2). \n \nProviding the first OSL scan (natural dose) indicated sufficiently bright emission, a \nregenerative procedure was applied to determine the palaeodose for the one or more grains \nlocated within each emitting area. Between each stage of the regenerative procedure the slices \nwere exposed to white light from an unfiltered tungsten-halogen lamp for at least 25 mins to \nensure trapped charge depletion. Following completion of the OSL regenerative procedure \nusing 488\/514 nm stimulation, each slice was scanned using either 850 nm (CW) or 532 nm \n(pulsed) laser radiation following administration of a beta dose to identify the location of \nfeldspar emissions; for the two samples discussed here the majority of bright grains detected \nwere attributed to quartz. \n \n 7\nThe areas delineated by analysis of the first OSL scan as showing the brightest emission were \nused as the basis for signal integration in all subsequent scans of the slice. These data were \nplotted as growth characteristics to determine the palaeodose for each area. As expected from \nthe measurements with disaggregated grains, the growth characteristics showed a linear \ndependence of OSL signal with dose within experimental error of \u00b15% (for brevity, not \nshown). The calculation of P was performed initially in units of (irradiation) time and then \nconverted to absorbed dose in quartz (mGy) using the spatially resolved calibration of the beta \nsource. Table 1 presents values of palaeodose, PSG, obtained for the bright areas in each slice \n(denoted surface grain) that were subsequently identified as single grains by visual \nexamination, together with their estimated grain size. The average values of palaeodose, Pi, \nobtained with disaggregated quartz grains extracted from each sample are also shown in the \ntable. The term surface grain is used below to refer to both abraded and unabraded grains. \n \n3.2 Comparison of palaeodose - HF etched quartz and single grains in slices  \nA comparison of the values of palaeodose obtained using the two experimental procedures \nwas performed by scaling the value of Pi, measured with HF etched grains, to obtain the \npredicted values of effective absorbed dose for surface grains of specified size in the surface \nof a slice, calPSG.  The scaling factor, SC, was calculated as the ratio of the total dose rate for \nthe surface grain, SGD& , to that for disaggregated HF etched grains, iD& ,  \ncalPSG = Pi\u00b7SC = Pi\u00b7( SGD& \/ iD& )  (1) \nD& i was obtained by summing the \u03b2, \u03b3 and cosmic dose-rate ( D& ) components for the quartz \ninclusion technique (Aitken, 1985), including lumped coefficients b and g to account for \nattenuation effects and irradiation geometry: \n iD&  = b \u03b2D& +g \u03b3D& + D& c  (2) \n 8\nThe calculation of SGD&  requires an estimation of the relative contributions of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \ncosmic radiation to the volume of the grain remaining in the slice. The contribution of alpha \nradiation to the total dose-rate varies according to the size of the grain and the extent to which \nit has been abraded. Examination of the slice surface indicated that the smaller grains were \nlikely to have been either mechanically removed from the surface or remain intact with slight \nabrasion, and that the larger grains (e.g., >150 \u03bcm dia.) were usually abraded, although there \nwere some instances where the blade cut through cavities above grains leaving them intact. \nTaking these considerations into account, the dose-rate to the volume corresponding to the \nsurviving portion of grain, when located in the undisturbed matrix, was calculated on the basis \nof the volumes penetrated by each radiation type, as indicated in Fig. 4.  \nIf the grain is exposed by cutting but is not abraded, \n SGD&  = (b \u03b2D& +g \u03b3D& + cD& ) + (VG-Vi) \u00b7 (a\u2032 \u03b1D& ) \/VG, (3) \nwhere the dose-rates D& and the coefficients b and g are defined in Eq. (2), a\u2032 represents a \nlumped coefficient to account for alpha efficiency and irradiation geometry, VG and Vi, are \nthe volumes of the whole grain and the inner grain volume of radius (R- \u03b1R) not penetrated by \nalpha irradiation respectively.  \nIf the grain is abraded, the dose rate is given by the following expression: \n SGD&  = (b\u2032 \u03b2D& +g \u03b3D& + cD& ) + (Vcap-Vicap) \u00b7 (a\u2032 \u03b1D& ) \/Vcap, (4) \nwhere the volumes Vcap and Vicap within an abraded grain are those below the plane of cutting, \nas indicated in Fig. 4, and where the lumped coefficient b for the abraded grain is denoted b\u2019. \nThe formulae for the volumes Vcap and Vicap can be expressed in terms of the grain radius R, \nthe parameter h and the alpha range \u03b1R, as discussed in the caption to Fig. 4. \nThe following assumptions were made when evaluating Eqs. (3) and (4): i) the alpha particle \neffectiveness and range were 0.10\u00b10.03 and 20 \u03bcm respectively, and the irradiation geometry \n 9\nwas 2\u03c0; ii) the grains were spherical; iii) the OSL sensitivity and transparency of the grains \nwere assumed to be uniform; iv) the distribution of dose within single grains due to \u03b3 and \ncosmic radiation was uniform. Also, when evaluating Eq. (4), it was assumed that larger \ngrains (>200 \u03bcm dia.) were abraded during cutting to a depth corresponding to half their \nradius.  The predicted change in the total dose-rate, DSG, with the degree of abrasion (i.e., h) \ncalculated using Eqn 4 and making the above assumptions is shown in Fig. 5 for unetched \ngrains of diameter 100 \u03bcm and 500 \u03bcm.  \nThe dose-rates D&  used in the calculation are based on measured rather than hypothetical data \nand the values of attenuation factors for spherical grains irradiated by beta particles emitted \nby lithogenic radionuclides in the surrounding medium were taken from Brennan (2003).  In \nthe case of the abraded grains, the value of the lumped coefficient b\u2032 differs from that for an \nunabraded grain because the beta dose within the unabraded grain generally decreases with \ndepth from the surface of the grain due to the effects of attenuation. The distribution of beta \ndose consequently changes in an abraded grain (except where a spherical grain cut in half), \nthe extent of which depends on the degree of abrasion. Estimates of b\u2032 were obtained using a \nsimple spherical grain model that accounts for the changes in the proportions of volumes \nwithin the grain (as concentric spherical shells) with the degree of abrasion and the absorbed \ndose profile within the grain (simulated using MCNP for a 40K beta decay energy spectrum). \nThese calculations indicate that the value of b\u2032 is generally higher than that of b due to the \nincreased weighting by the outer layers of the grain that have received a higher absorbed dose \nrelative to volumes closer to the centre of the grain. However, for the grain size ranges \nrelevant to the samples discussed here, the increase is slight (~5%), and this has been taken \ninto account when performing an analysis of uncertainty in SGD& , as discussed further below.   \nFinally, the values of calPSG (= SC\u00b7Pi) calculated for each sample are shown in Figs 6a,b (open \ncircles) for a range of grain diameters in the surface of the slice and these are to be compared \n 10\nwith the experimental values PSG for the surface grains in the slice (open triangles). The \nexperimental value of Pi for HF etched quartz, from which the calculated values calPSG were \nderived by scaling, is also shown (filled square).  To obtain a measure of the effect of \nuncertainty in the extent of abrasion of the larger grains, a Monte Carlo simulation (using the \nsoftware program Crystal Ball, Decisioneering Inc.) of the calculation of calPSG was performed \nin which the depth of the surviving portion of grain, h, was allowed to vary within a range of \na quarter of the grain diameter, and the distribution obtained was used to define the \nuncertainty in the values shown in Figs. 6a,b. As indicated in Fig. 5, the sensitivity of the total \ndose-rate, D& i, to variation in h is not particularly strong (according to this approximation).  \nSince the beta source was calibrated for sub-surface grains (90-150 \u03bcm dia.), an additional \nadjustment was made to calPSG for grains larger than 200 \u03bcm to account for the reduction for \nthe source dose-rate with depth in the slice.  \n \n4. Discussion \nThe finding of a relatively small number of bright grains (Fig. 2) was generally consistent \nwith scans obtained with other slices tested from the same and similar samples. It was \nsurprising to find that the value of P obtained with disaggregated HF etched quartz grains \nextracted from sample 294-17 was measured with relatively high precision since the fabric \nhas a generally heterogeneous composition (Fig. 3). This is relevant to the investigation of \nsamples that exhibit significant scatter in the value of palaeodose and where the cause could \nbe related to the sporadic distribution of a small number of bright grains in a fabric arising \nfrom a strongly heterogeneous beta radiation field or, on the other hand, an undetected factor \nassociated with the properties of the quartz inclusions that affects the determination of P.  \n \n 11\nThe greater spatial extent of the OSL associated with a single grain compared with its \nphysical size (e.g., the large grain within slice 294-17 circled in Fig. 3) is a consequence of \nbeam size and localised scattering of laser light at the slice surface. The beam diameter \n(FWHM ~250 \u03bcm and FWQM ~500 \u03bcm) was adjusted to be equivalent to the step size to \nobtain continuity of optical stimulation and also tolerance to small differences in sample \npositioning (i.e., 50 \u03bcm). In this respect the scanner has been optimised for the measurement \nof a relatively small number of bright grains in an opaque matrix and the aim has not been to \nperform imaging, as with a CCD system (e.g. Spooner, 2000; Habermann et al., 2000; \nGreilich et al., 2002). The extent of optical bleaching of grains located beyond the stimulation \narea due to scattered light was also investigated in previous tests. Measurements with grains \nlocated in areas stimulated towards the start and finish of a scan indicated that the level of \nbleaching during a scan (typically lasting 50 mins) due to scattered laser light was less than \n10%. Providing the series of scanning measurements applied to a slice remains unaltered \nthroughout the regenerative sequence, this level of bleaching is not expected to give rise to \nsystematic differences in the value of absorbed dose due to the position of an emitting grain in \nthe scan sequence.  \n \nTurning to the values of PSG (Figs 6a,b and Table 1) obtained for single grains in the two \nslices, reasonably consistent values were obtained for grains judged to be of similar size. For \ngrains of nominal diameter 200 and 100 \u03bcm the average values of P for samples 294-17 and \n304 were 1560\u00b170 mGy (s.d. 3) and 1910\u00b155 mGy (s.d. 4) respectively. Despite the potential \nfor variability in this type of experiment, the relative error is comparable to that obtained with \nHF etched disaggregated grains. The trend in the reduction of the experimental values of \npalaeodose with increasing grain size is also consistent with expectation. The level of \nagreement achieved between the average experimental values and the corresponding \n 12\ncalculated values is reasonable in view of the series of assumptions and approximations made. \nThe differences in the central values of the experimental data (1560\u00b170 mGy and 1910\u00b155 \nmGy) and the corresponding predicted values (1820\u00b150 mGy and 1780\u00b185 mGy) for grains \nlocated in the sliced samples represent an underestimate of 15% and an overestimate of 9% \nfor samples 294-17 and 304 respectively. Given the approximations discussed above, this \nlevel of agreement is encouraging.  \n \n5. Conclusions \nAlthough, from a dosimetry perspective, the experimental approach required to measure \nabsorbed dose for single grains in slices is inevitably more complex than the quartz inclusion \nmethod, it has the potential to provide information concerning absorbed dose that is not \navailable by performing measurements with disaggregated grains. The results of the \nexperiments described in this paper suggest that reliable determinations of palaeodose can be \nobtained with single quartz grains, judged in this case against the conventional quartz \ninclusion technique.   In particular, it provides a means of investigating the issue of a non-\nisotropic radiation field in the sample matrix and, ultimately, the possibility of dating single \ngrains in situ if the experimental difficulties of microdosimetry of the immediate grain \nenvironment can be overcome, an issue that harks back to earlier research (e.g., Miallier et al., \n1985). \n \nAcknowledgements \nI am grateful to Mr. S.

Variation in beta source dose-rate with distance from the central axis. The open circles \nrepresent experimental determinations of source dose-rate to the sub-surface of a 1 mm-thick \nceramic slice using 90-150 \u03bcm quartz grains, as discussed in the main text. The filled \ntriangles represent the calculated values of absorbed dose based on Monte Carlo simulations \nof electron transport in the ceramic slice. Each set of data is normalised to the initial value of \ndose. \n \nFig. 2. Contour plot of OSL distribution for slice 294-17-S4, measured using blue\/green \nstimulation wavelengths (488\/514 nm); the dimensions of both axes are \u03bcm. \n \nFig. 3. Photographic image of slice 294-17-S4 bonded to its metal positioning plate. The \nwidth of the slice is 13 mm. The area contained in the white circle is a grain of ~500 \u03bcm \ndiameter at the surface and which was located just below the cutting blade and consequently \nnot abraded. The darkest areas are fissures in the fabric. \n \nFig. 4. Geometric cross section of a spherical grain, of volume VG, that identifies the radius \n(R), the depth of penetration of alpha radiation (\u03b1R) and the depth, h, of the surviving part of \nthe grain in the ceramic slice after cutting as indicated by the dotted line. The difference \nbetween the volumes Vcap and Vicap in the surviving part of the grain below the cutting plane \nrepresents the portion of the grain that would have been penetrated by \u03b1 radiation, whereas \nboth volumes are penetrated by \u03b2, \u03b3 and cosmic radiation.  \n \nFig. 5. Variation in total dose-rate SGD& with h (see Fig. 4) for unetched grains calculated using \nthe approximations described in the main text, for grain diameters of 100 \u03bcm (open circles) \nand 500 \u03bcm (filled circles). The values of SGD&  were normalised to the total dose-rate, iD& , for \nHF etched grains of diameter 90-150 \u03bcm. \n \nFig. 6. Values of absorbed dose (palaeodose) vs mean grain diameters for slices a) 294-17-S4 \nand b) 304-1-S2.  The experimental values, Pi and PSG, are shown as open triangles and as a \nfilled square for single grains in the slice and 90-150 mm disaggregated HF etched grains \nrespectively. The uncertainties in the single grain diameters are estimates. The open circles \nrepresent the predicted values of absorbed dose, calculated using the approach discussed in \n 18\nthe main text, calPSG, to single grains of the size indicated that were calculated using the \napproach discussed in the main text. \n 19\n \n \n \n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nRadial Distance (mm)\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \nD\nos\ne\n \n \nFig. 1 \n 20\n \n \n \n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\n \n \n \nFig. 2 \n 21\n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3 \n 22\n \n \n \n\u03b1R\nh\nR\nVcap\nV icap\n \n \n \nFig. 4 \n 23\n \n \n \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nh (\u03bcm)\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ndo\nse\n-r\nat\ne\n \n \nFig. 5 \n 24\n \n \n \na) \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nMean Grain Diameter (\u03bcm)\nA\nbs\nor\nbe\nd \ndo\nse\n (m\nG\ny)\n \n \nb) \n \n \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n0 100 200 300\nMean Grain Diameter (\u03bcm)\nA\nbs\nor\nbe\nd \ndo\nse\n (m\nG\ny)\n \n \nFig. 6 \n"}
