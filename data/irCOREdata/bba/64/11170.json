From the observations by the PIXIE and UVI\ncameras on board the Polar satellite, we derive global maps\nof the precipitating electron energy spectra from less than\n1 keV to 100 keV. Based on the electron spectra, we gen-\nerate instantaneous global maps of Hall and Pedersen con-\nductances. The UVI camera provides good coverage of the\nlower electron energies contributing most to the Pedersen\nconductance, while PIXIE captures the high energy compo-\nnent of the precipitating electrons affecting the Hall conduc-\ntance. By characterizing the energetic electrons from some\ntens of keV and up to about 100 keV using PIXIE X-ray mea-\nsurements, we will, in most cases, calculate a larger electron\nflux at higher energies than estimated from a simple extrap-\nolation of derived electron spectra from UVI alone. Instan-\ntaneous global conductance maps derived with and without\ninclusion of PIXIE data have been implemented in the As-\nsimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE)\nprocedure, to study the effects of energetic electrons on elec-\ntrodynamical parameters in the ionosphere. We find that the\nimproved electron spectral characterization using PIXIE data\nmost often results in a larger Hall conductance and a smaller\ninferred electric field. In some localized regions the increase\nin the Hall conductance can exceed 100%. On the contrary,\nthe Pedersen conductance remains more or less unaffected\nby the inclusion of the PIXIE data. The calculated polar cap\npotential drop may decrease more than 10%, resulting in a\nreduction of the estimated Joule heating integrated over the\nNorthern Hemisphere by up to 20%. Locally, Joule heat-\ning may decrease more than 50% in some regions. We also\nfind that the calculated energy flux by precipitating electrons\nincreases around 5% when including the PIXIE data. Com-\nbined with the reduction of Joule heating, this results in a\ndecrease in the ratio between Joule heating and energy flux,\nsometimes exceeding 25%. An investigation of the relation-\nship between Joule heating and the AE index shows a nearly\nCorrespondence to: A. Aksnes (Arve.Aksnes@fi.uib.no)\nlinear correspondence between the two quantities, in accor-\ndance with previous studies. However, we find lower pro-\nportionality factors than reported by others when taking geo-\nmagnetic conditions into account, ranging between 0.13 and\n0.23 GW\/nT. We also find that the contribution from auroral\nparticles to the energy budget is more important than most\nprevious studies have reported.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; particle precip-\nitation) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (storms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nAn auroral substorm is one of the most striking features we\nknow, as it often results in bright and beautiful aurora in\nthe sky. However, it is also a significant phenomena, be-\ncause of its relationship to magnetospheric dynamics. Under-\nstanding the electrodynamics in the ionosphere is crucial to\nimproving our understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling. Developing this understanding is greatly compli-\ncated by the fact that the electrodynamic behavior changes\ndrastically during auroral substorms.\nIn order to gain more knowledge about the processes that\ncouple the different regions in the near-Earth environment,\nwe need to know how the electrodynamics in the ionosphere\nvary during a substorm and how the different parameters re-\nlate to each other. The Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric\nElectrodynamics (AMIE) procedure is a tool to understand\nthe electrodynamics, as this technique provides global instan-\ntaneous distributions of ionospheric electrodynamical pa-\nrameters.\nIn a statistical study \u00d8stgaard et al. (1999) investigated the\nglobal features of the aurora using X-ray measurements from\nthe Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment (PIXIE)\nand ultraviolet emissions from the Ultraviolet Imager (UVI)\non board the Polar satellite. They studied 14 isolated sub-\n476 A. Aksnes et al.: Effects of energetic electrons on ionospheric electrodynamics\nstorm events from 1996, and they found significant changes\nbetween the particle precipitation detected by the UVI and\nPIXIE cameras. The growth phase was found to be domi-\nnated by lower electron energies less than 10 keV, well mea-\nsured by UVI. As the expansion phase took place, UVI data\nshowed intense precipitation in the duskward part of the au-\nroral bulge. PIXIE, on the other hand, revealed an east-\nward drift of the X-ray aurora. During the recovery phase,\nPIXIE showed a precipitation maximum in the morning sec-\ntor which was not seen by UVI. Many studies have reported\nsuch a maximum in the energetic electron precipitation in\nthe dawn region, including substorm studies (Jelly and Brice,\n1967; Berkey et al., 1974; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2001; Aksnes et\nal., 2002) and statistical studies involving different geomag-\nnetic conditions (Hartz and Brice, 1967; McDiarmid et al.,\n1975; Wallis and Budzinski, 1981; Spiro et al., 1982; Hardy\net al., 1985; Hardy et al., 1987). \u00d8stgaard et al. (1999) used\nmodels of the gradient and curvature drift of electrons to es-\ntimate the energy of eastward drifting electrons causing the\nX-rays seen by PIXIE. Their result indicated average electron\nenergies usually within 90 and 120 keV, though one particu-\nlar event actually revealed an electron energy between 180\nand 200 keV. Such energetic electrons during substorms are\nin accordance with X-ray studies by Sletten et al. (1971) and\nKangas et al. (1975).\nThe electron density is critical for determining the iono-\nspheric conductivities (Chapman, 1956), meaning that the\nHall and Pedersen conductivities can be strongly affected\nby electron precipitation. A study by Aksnes et al. (2002)\nshowed that the calculation of an accurate Hall conductance\ndepends strongly on measurements of energetic electrons up\nto 100 keV. Aksnes et al. (2002) also used Polar data from the\nPIXIE and UVI cameras, in order to provide instantaneous\nglobal conductance maps. By calculating the conductivities\nfrom combined PIXIE and UVI measurements, to compare\nwith the conductivities from using UVI data only, they found\nsignificant differences in the Hall conductance. In some re-\ngions, the Hall conductance increased by almost 50% when\nincluding the energetic electrons estimated from the PIXIE\nmeasurements. On the contrary, the Pedersen conductance\nwas hardly affected at all. This is explained by the fact that\nthe largest Pedersen and Hall conductivities are occurring in\ndifferent height regions. Electrons with energies in the range\nof a few keV will deposit their energy around 125 km (Rees,\n1963), where the Pedersen conductivity peaks. Higher elec-\ntron energies will penetrate further down in the ionosphere,\ncontributing more to the Hall conductivity. The highest val-\nues of the Hall conductivity are found below 110 km, where\nthe ions are strongly coupled to the neutrals.\nThe intensity of the shortest UVI-wavelengths decreases\nstrongly at higher electron energies (Lummerzheim et al.,\n1991; Germany et al., 1990; 1998b), so UVI measurements\nare unable to accurately characterize the most energetic elec-\ntrons. Several papers have shown that the electron energy\nspectrum often changes and becomes harder at higher en-\nergies, meaning that the slope of the spectrum flattens out\n(Meng et al., 1979; Goldberg et al., 1982; Miller and Von-\ndrak, 1985; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2000). Therefore it is not suffi-\ncient to simply extrapolate the UVI derived electron energy\nspectra in order to take the higher electron energies into ac-\ncount. The improved electron spectral characterization at\nhigher energies using PIXIE data may sometimes result in\na lower electron flux than calculated from extrapolated UVI\nderived electron spectra. As we will see in this study, how-\never, the most likely situation when including PIXIE data\nto characterize the precipitating electrons is a significantly\nlarger flux at higher electron energies.\nIn this paper the AMIE procedure is used for the first\ntime to study the effects of energetic electrons on the elec-\ntrodynamics in the ionosphere. The term \u201cenergetic elec-\ntrons\u201d refers to the electrons from approximately 20 keV up\nto about 100 keV, estimated from the PIXIE measurements\nresponsible for a hardening of the spectra compared to the\nextrapolated UVI spectra. The technique used to calculate\nthe conductances from the PIXIE and UVI data is described\nin Sect. 2, while Sect. 3 gives a brief overview of the AMIE\nprocedure and the method and data sets used for this study.\nResults are presented in Sect. 4 and discussed in Sect. 5. Fi-\nnally, we summarize and conclude in Sect. 6.\n2 Deriving ionospheric conductances from X-rays and\nUV-emissions\nData from the PIXIE and UVI cameras are used to obtain\nglobal instantaneous ionospheric Hall and Pedersen conduc-\ntances. We present in this section the methodology used to\ndeduce the conductances.\n2.1 Deriving electron energy spectra from the PIXIE mea-\nsurements\nBremsstrahlung is produced when precipitating electrons in-\nteract with the nuclei of atmospheric particles to form a con-\ntinuous spectrum of X-rays. X-ray photons between approx-\nimately 2 and 22 keV were measured by the pinhole camera\nPIXIE on Polar (Imhof et al., 1995).\nFrom neutron transport codes (Lorence, 1992), a coupled\nelectron photon transport code has been developed. This has\nresulted in a look-up table giving the production emitted at\ndifferent zenith angles for electrons with different exponen-\ntial energy spectra. By using this look-up table, we are able to\nderive a four-parameter representation of the electron spec-\ntral distribution causing the measured X-rays (see \u00d8stgaard\net al., 2000, for more details).\n2.2 Deriving electron energy spectra from the UVI mea-\nsurements\nUV-emissions are produced by the electrons precipitating\nin the atmosphere. Protons can also contribute to the UV-\nemissions (Frey et al., 2001). This may cause uncertainties\nin the estimation of conductivities, which we will discuss in\nmore detail in Sect. 5.2.\nA. Aksnes et al.: Effects of energetic electrons on ionospheric electrodynamics 477\nThe UVI instrument (Torr et al., 1995) provides global im-\nages of emissions within the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH)\nband (140\u2013180 nm). Within this emission band, the O2 ab-\nsorption differs significantly, as the O2 Schumann-Runge ab-\nsorption continuum peaks at the shorter wavelengths and de-\ncreases with longer wavelengths. The UV-emissions have\nbeen separated into LBHS (140\u2013160 nm) and LBHL (160\u2013\n180 nm), where S and L refer to short and long wavelengths,\nrespectively. By taking the ratio between the intensities of\nthe two LBH-bands, we are able to derive the average elec-\ntron energy, as the shorter wavelengths (LBHS) are subject\nto significantly greater O2 absorption than the longer wave-\nlengths (LBHL). The intensity of the LBHL emissions are\nfurther used to calculate the electron energy flux. A more\ndetailed description is given by Germany et al. (1997, 1998a,\nb).\n2.3 Deriving electron energy spectra from both PIXIE and\nUVI measurements\nWe combine derived energy spectra from PIXIE and UVI, in\norder to estimate a more reliable spectrum having an elec-\ntron energy range between approximately 0.1 and 100 keV\n(\u00d8stgaard et al., 2001). Since the production of X-ray pho-\ntons is low, we need to include measurements from an exten-\nsive area or to increase the time averaging, in order to obtain\ncount rates that are statistically significant to derive a proper\nelectron spectrum. The spatial resolution of the PIXIE cam-\nera is rather coarse, varying between 600 and 900 km at a\ndistance 6\u20138RE from the Earth. By dividing the measure-\nments into boxes of 6\u25e6 in corrected geomagnetic (CGM) lat-\nitude by 1h in magnetic local time (MLT) (\u00d8stgaard et al.,\n2001), we derive the energy spectra from a region compa-\nrable in size with the spatial resolution of PIXIE. The first\nbox is between CGM latitudes 52 and 58\u25e6, and the last box\nis situated at CGM latitudes 76\u201382\u25e6. Due to a high voltage\nproblem, a duty cycling scheme is applied, meaning that one\nof the detecting chambers of PIXIE is on 4.5 min and then\noff for some minutes. In this paper, we will present data\nfor a substorm event occurring on 26 June 1998, when the\nchamber is off for 5.5 min, leaving us with images of 4.5 min\nexposure every 10 min. We will also study the electrody-\nnamics during two other substorm events from 1997, when\nwe have images every 15 min. The UVI camera has a much\nbetter time resolution than the PIXIE instrument. It takes\non the order of two minutes, dependent on operating mode,\nto accumulate the two LBH images needed to perform an\nelectron energy spectrum analysis. The spatial resolution is\nalso much better for the UVI instrument, though the wob-\nbling of the Polar satellite considerably degrades the reso-\nlution in one direction. From apogee the spatial resolution\nis approximately 40 km \u00d7 360 km. In order to combine the\nmeasurements from PIXIE and UVI, we average UVI pixels\ncontained within the boxes of 6\u25e6 in CGM latitude by 1h in\nMLT and within the exposure time of the PIXIE measure-\nments.\nFrom the X-ray measurements, we derive a four-parameter\nexponential electron spectrum. From the UV-emission data,\nwe estimate an average electron energy, as well as an en-\nergy flux. These data are used to fit an exponential and\na Maxwellian distribution. We then choose the spectrum\nwhich gives the smoothest transition to the exponential elec-\ntron spectrum derived from the PIXIE data.\n2.4 Deriving conductance values from the energy spectra\nThe University of Maryland has developed a computer code\nto model the ionospheric effects of energy deposition by pre-\ncipitating particles. Their computer code is based on the\nTANGLE code (Vondrak and Baron, 1976; Vondrak and\nRobinson, 1985). By giving the electron spectra derived from\nthe PIXIE and UVI measurements as input, this code can es-\ntimate the conductivities. As a first step, the electron produc-\ntion rate q is calculated. This process involves a model of\nthe atmosphere, and the code uses a set of values for neutral\ndensity, composition and temperature which are comparable\nwith the Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter Extended\nAtmospheric model (MSIS-E-90). We also need a deposition\nfunction of the electron energy, which is set to be the cosine-\ndependent Isotropic over the Downward Hemisphere (IDH)\nmodel of Rees (1963). After calculating the electron pro-\nduction rate q, the code establishes a value of the electron\ndensity Ne from the time-dependent rate equation:\ndNe\/dt = q(h)\u2212 \u03b1eff(h) \u2217N2e (h). (1)\nDiffusive transport is negligible at the heights contributing to\nthe conductances and is therefore not included in Eq. (1). The\neffective dissociative recombination coefficient \u03b1eff is calcu-\nlated by using formulas derived from Vickrey et al. (1982)\nand Gledhill (1986). As the recombination time is of the\norder of seconds, we assume chemical equilibrium and set\ndNe\/dt = 0. By using electron-neutral collision frequen-\ncies from Thrane and Piggott (1966), as well as ion-neutral\ncollision frequencies from Vickrey et al. (1981), the conduc-\ntivities are derived.\n2.5 Limitations in the technique used to derive the iono-\nspheric conductances from PIXIE and UVI measure-\nments\nThe rather coarse PIXIE resolution (600\u2013900 km) means that\nwe cannot resolve localized enhancements in the energetic\nelectron flux. Therefore, the strongest Hall conductance val-\nues derived using PIXIE X-ray measurements seldom exceed\n50 S. In comparison, Gjerloev and Hoffman (2000) were able\nto identify much larger Hall conductance peaks of more than\n100 S using electron precipitation data from the Dynamic\nExplorer (DE) 2 satellite. These values were reported to be\nhighly localized, with a scale size of typically 20 km. Similar\nresults showing maximum values of about 90 S were found\nby Marklund et al. (1982), using particle data obtained by\nthe S23L1 rocket crossing over a discrete pre-breakup arc in\nJanuary 1979. Kirkwood et al. (1988) calculated Hall con-\n478 A. Aksnes et al.: Effects of energetic electrons on ionospheric electrodynamics\nductance values reaching 120 S, using electron density pro-\nfiles with high resolution in both altitude (2 km) and time\n(5 s) obtained from the European Incoherent Scatter (EIS-\nCAT) radar. Aikio and Kaila (1996) also made use of EIS-\nCAT data and determined an extreme value of 214 S. Morelli\net al. (1995) combined measurements of the line-of-sight\n(LOS) Doppler velocity from the PACE HF radar located\nin Antarctica with conjugate magnetic observations on the\nGreenland west meridian chain, to estimate the Hall conduc-\ntance. Despite the large uncertainty, as the data compared\nwere taken from different hemispheres, it is interesting to\nnote that the results found by Morelli et al. for a multiple-\nonset substorm on 12 April 1988, indicate Hall conductances\nof \u223c80\u2013160 S. The inability to identify localized structures\nusing PIXIE measurements means that the electron flux at\nhigher energies is being smoothed over a broad region. This\nimplies that the effects of energetic electrons to be presented\nin this study should be even more significant and much larger\nin localized regions with strong gradients in the precipitation.\nAnother issue is the estimation of electron spectra from\nUVI and PIXIE data. As explained in Sects. 2.1\u20132.3,\nthis procedure is not straightforward, as the precipitating\nelectrons are derived indirectly from measurements of UV-\nemissions and X-ray photons. For the low electron energy\nrange based on UV-emissions, Germany et al. (2001) per-\nformed a sensitivity study and estimated an upper limit of\n23% for modelling errors when calculating mean energies.\nNon-modelling errors, such as imaging processing and Pois-\nson uncertainties, were estimated by Germany et al. (1997;\n1998a; 1998b) to be 3 and 5%, respectively. In a study,\nwhere both UVI and PIXIE measurements were used to de-\nrive the electron spectra in the energy range from 0.1 keV to\n100 keV, \u00d8stgaard et al. (2001) found the derived electron\nenergy flux to be in fairly good agreement with in situ par-\nticle measurements from the Defense Meteorological Satel-\nlite Program (DMSP) spacecraft. An average ratio of 1.03\n\u00b1 0.6 was found between the measured and derived energy\nflux between 90 eV and 30 keV. Note that the large standard\ndeviation is caused by the different spatial resolutions. The\nelectron fluxes measured along the trajectory by a polar or-\nbiting satellite are not necessarily the same as the average\nelectron flux in the corresponding PIXIE pixel.\n3 The AMIE procedure\nThe AMIE procedure is an optimally constrained, weighted,\nleast-squares fitting of coefficients to measurements of dif-\nferent electrodynamical quantities. The purpose of AMIE is\nto obtain the best possible estimate of the electrodynamics in\nthe ionosphere by combining available observations of elec-\ntrodynamical parameters. AMIE uses apex coordinates (Van-\nZandt et al., 1972; Richmond, 1995) and has a grid size of\nabout 1.7\u25e6 in latitude and 10\u25e6 in longitude. The AMIE proce-\ndure is described in detail by Richmond and Kamide\u2018(1988)\nand Richmond (1992). We will only give a brief overview\nbelow.\n3.1 Ionospheric electrodynamics derived from AMIE\nAMIE first estimates Hall and Pedersen conductances by us-\ning observational data to modify a statistical conductance\nmodel. This includes, for example, satellite measurements of\nprecipitating particles through empirical formulas by Robin-\nson et al. (1987) involving energy flux and mean energy.\nMagnetic perturbations observed at the Earth\u2019s surface are\nfurther used to modify the conductance pattern (Ahn et al.,\n1983a). Through formulas by Kroehl (Kroehl, personal com-\nmunication, 1991) the solar-induced conductances, depend-\ning on the solar zenith angle and the F10.7 flux value, are\nalso incorporated in the AMIE procedure. By combining all\navailable data and assuming that the modified conductances\nideally represent the true conductances, AMIE estimates the\nelectric convection patterns. In this process the different data\nsets are weighted according to their errors, so that the most\nreliable data will contribute most to the fitting. A statistical\nconvection model is incorporated in regions where no in situ\nmeasurements exist. After establishing the conductance and\nthe convection patterns, AMIE then provides distributions of\nelectrodynamical parameters, such as Joule heating 6PE2,\nheight-integrated electric currents J\u22a5 and field-aligned cur-\nrents \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 J\u22a5. Note that the effects of neutral wind are ne-\nglected in AMIE, as it is difficult to obtain a realistic wind\npattern.\n3.2 Data and method used in this study\nThe electrodynamical parameters derived from AMIE rely\nstrongly upon the conductance patterns established. In this\nstudy, we make use of instantaneous global conductance\nmaps derived from PIXIE and UVI measurements. As\npointed out in Sect. 1., we need to include the precipitat-\ning electrons up to \u223c100 keV as estimated from the PIXIE\ndata, in order to derive a more accurate Hall conductance.\nEffects of energetic electrons on the electrodynamics have\nbeen investigated by running AMIE using two different sets\nof conductances calculated with and without the use of the\nPIXIE data. To study the largest possible effects, we have\nlimited the set of data to include ionospheric conductivity\nfrom PIXIE and UVI data and surface magnetic field mea-\nsurements from ground-based magnetometers. The statisti-\ncal conductance model of Fuller-Rowell and Evans (1987)\nand the statistical convection model of Millstone Hill (Foster\net al., 1986) are implemented in AMIE in regions not covered\nby real measurements.\nThree periods with substorm activity from 31 July and\n28 August 1997, and 26 June 1998, have been investigated,\nwhen the Polar satellite was at apogee over the Northern\nHemisphere. During these events, data from approximately\n140 magnetometer stations have been included in the AMIE-\ncalculations, of which about 65 of these were located in the\nhigh-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Note that PIXIE usu-\nally has a larger field of view than UVI. In order to perform\na proper investigation of the effects of energetic electrons,\nA. Aksnes et al.: Effects of energetic electrons on ionospheric electrodynamics 479\nFig. 1. The AE, AL and Dst -indices\nbetween 00:00 and 12:00 UT on 26\nJune 1998. AE and AL are calculated\nfrom 63 stations between 55 and 76\u25e6\nin magnetic latitudes. Dst is calculated\nfrom 24 stations below 40\u25e6 in magnetic\nlatitudes. The two vertical dashed lines\nindicate our time interval with data be-\ntween 03:00 and 08:00 UT.\nwe have excluded the PIXIE measurements from regions not\ncovered by UVI.\n4 Results\n4.1 26 June 1998\nThe geomagnetic indices AE(63), AL(63) and Dst (24) are\npresented in Fig. 1, showing very disturbed conditions dur-\ning the early part of this day. Note that the numbers in the\nparenthesis of 63 and 24, respectively, indicate the number\nof magnetometer stations included in the calculation of the\nindices. We have measurements from PIXIE and UVI be-\ntween 03:00 and 08:00 UT, as indicated by the two verti-\ncal dashed lines. The main phase of a geomagnetic storm\nlasted until 04:50 UT, when theDst (24) index reached a min-\nimum of \u2212128 nT and thus, is classified as an intense storm\n(Gonzalez et al., 1994). At the beginning of the recovery\nphase, a substorm event took place with the magnitude of the\nAE(63) and the AL(63) indices at 05:40 UT exceeding 1600\nand \u22121300 nT, respectively.\nIn Fig. 2 we present global maps of the Hall conduc-\ntance 6H derived during the time period between 05:30 and\n06:00 UT on 26 June 1998. The images are 10 min apart,\nwith an integration time of about 4.5 min and the middle time\nas indicated on top of each column. The upper row con-\ntains the distribution of the Hall conductance calculated with\nthe AMIE procedure by using magnetometer data and the\nUVI measurements. In the middle row, the PIXIE data have\nalso been included in the calculation of Hall conductance.\nWe note that the values of Hall conductance are significantly\nhigher when we make use of the PIXIE data, as the improved\nspectral characterization of the most energetic electrons has\nresulted in a larger flux at higher electron energies. This is\nclearly illustrated by the images in the bottom row, which\nshow the local differences in percent when we take into ac-\ncount the energetic electrons from the PIXIE measurements.\nWe find that the differences in Hall conductance can exceed\n60% in some regions when including the PIXIE data. It\nshould be noted, though, that some of the largest differences\nare found in regions where the Hall conductance values are\nrelatively low. The Pedersen conductance 6P remains more\nor less unaffected by the increased electron flux at larger en-\nergies, as shown in Fig. 3. By comparing global maps of the\nPedersen conductance without the PIXIE data (upper row)\nwith the ones that includes the PIXIE measurements (middle\nrow) for the same time interval, as presented in Fig. 2, we\nhardly see any difference at all. The images in the bottom\nrow showing the differences in percent tell us that the local\nvariations are generally less than 5%.\nIn Fig. 4, we present the distributions of electric potential\nduring the same 3 successive time periods, as in Fig. 2 and\nFig. 3. The black lines represent the electric potential pat-\ntern when we have not included PIXIE data, while the red\nlines show the situation after taking into account the ener-\ngetic electrons. We note that the general configuration of the\npatterns remains the same. However, the potential contours\nshift as the estimated electric field values decrease in regions\nwhere the PIXIE data have resulted in a higher Hall conduc-\ntance. We observe that the lines more or less overlap around\nnoon, consistent with the fact that the images in the bottom\nrow of Fig. 2 show negligible differences in this region when\n480 A.

However, from the pre-midnight\nsector until the morning region, we find significant modifica-\ntions of the electric field strength due to the precipitation of\nenergetic electrons. Below each of the images presented in\nFig. 4, we have listed the values of the calculated polar cap\npotential drop 8PC , showing a clear reduction when includ-\ning the PIXIE measurements.\nValues of the potential drop during the whole time period\nwhen we have measurements from PIXIE and UVI between\n03:00 and 08:00 UT on 26 June 1998, are presented in the\nupper row of Fig. 5a. The dashed line represents the poten-\ntial drop derived without the PIXIE data, while the solid line\ngives the values after including the PIXIE measurements.\nThe diamonds give the middle time in each integration pe-\nriod. We see that the inclusion of energetic electrons causes\na reduction in the potential drop. The plot below presents the\ndifference in percent with and without the PIXIE data, show-\ning a general decrease between 5 and 10%. In Fig. 5b, we\ngive the values of the Joule heating rate QJ integrated over\nthe Northern Hemisphere. Similarly to the electric poten-\ntial, we find that the estimated Joule heating decreases when\nincluding the PIXIE measurements. For most of the time pe-\nriod investigated, the decrease is between 10 and 15%, as\nshown in the bottom row of Fig. 5b. The larger decrease in\nJoule heating compared to that in the potential drop is not\nsurprising, as Joule heating QJ depends on the square of the\nelectric field E according to the formula:\nQJ = 6PE2. (2)\nThe inferred energy flux QA by precipitating particles in-\ncreases when we include the energetic electrons from PIXIE.\nAt most, the increase is about 7% during the time period in-\nvestigated from the event of 26 June 1998. Since Joule heat-\ning decreases when including the PIXIE data, we find that the\nenergy flux QA compared with Joule heating QJ becomes\nsignificantly more important. In Fig. 5c, we have plotted the\nratio QJ \/QA. The dashed line representing the ratios with-\nout using the PIXIE data shows the highest ratios. When in-\ncluding the PIXIE data, the ratio decreases, as shown by the\nsolid line. The difference sometimes exceeds 20%. We note\nthat the ratio is larger than 1 throughout almost the entire pe-\nriod, meaning that the energy due to Joule heating generally\nexceeds the energy flux deposited by precipitating particles.\nHowever, the difference between Joule heating and energy\nflux reduces significantly when including the PIXIE data.\nFrom Fig. 5, we can conclude that the maximum change\nin the hemispheric integrated Joule heating rate from adding\nPIXIE observations is \u223c 17%. However, there can be much\nlarger decreases in localized regions, as shown in Fig. 6.\nHere we present global maps of Joule heating, showing lo-\ncal decreases sometimes exceeding 50% when including the\nPIXIE data. The changes in Joule heating take place in re-\ngions where there is a significant flux of energetic electrons.\nFor instance, looking at the images from 05:33 UT, the up-\nper row shows the strongest Joule heating stretching from\nabout 13:00 until 02:00 MLT. Including the PIXIE data re-\nsults in significant decreases of approximately 25 and 50%\nin the pre-midnight sector after 19:00 MLT. This corresponds\n482 A.

The\nparameters have been calculated with-\nout (dashed line) and with (solid line)\nPIXIE data. The differences in per-\ncent when including PIXIE measure-\nments are also presented.\nwell with the images of the Hall conductance in Fig. 2 from\nthe same time period, showing the largest differences to take\nplace in this pre-midnight sector.\nDuring the whole time period between 03:00 and\n08:00 UT on 26 June 1998, when we have PIXIE and UVI\nmeasurements, AMIE provides 9058 data values from re-\ngions covered by both instruments.These values are pre-\nsented as a scatter plot in Fig. 7, showing the effects of\nenergetic electrons occurring at different levels of conduc-\ntances and Joule heating. The distribution of Hall conduc-\ntance is given in Fig. 7a in terms of dots, giving the UVI\nderived values along the horizontal axis and the values when\nincluding the PIXIE measurements along the vertical axis.\nFrom Fig. 7a, we observe a rather systematic increase in the\nHall conductance caused by the inclusion of energetic elec-\ntrons. By performing a simple linear regression analysis, we\nfind that the Hall conductance, on average, increases by 10%\nwhen taking into account the PIXIE measurements. This in-\ncrease in the Hall conductance is indicated with the solid line\nrepresenting a function f (x) having a proportionality factor\nof 1.098. We also note that in some cases the values dif-\nfer strongly, exceeding more than 100% when including the\nPIXIE data in the estimation of the Hall conductance. The\ndashed line having a proportionality factor of 1.0 is drawn\nto indicate the locations of the Hall conductance values in\ncases where the two data sets provide the same output. As\ninclusion of PIXIE data usually leads to a larger Hall con-\nductance, we therefore find 84% of the dots located above\nthe dashed line. In some cases the improved spectral char-\nacterization at higher energies by using PIXIE data results in\na lower electron flux than calculated using extrapolated UVI\nspectra. This explains the dots located below the dashed line\nin Fig. 7a. We should point out that the individual dots rep-\nresent a significant uncertainty considering the complex pro-\ncedure to estimate electron energy spectra from combined\nPIXIE and UVI measurements, as described in Sect. 2. The\nuncertainties will show up as noise though, and not as a sys-\ntematic error in our data. Taking the standard deviation on\nthe slope of the regression line of 0.003 into account, we can\ntherefore conclude that a larger estimated Hall conductance\nis to be expected when including PIXIE data in the calcu-\nlations. A similar scatter plot is presented in Fig. 7b, giv-\ning the Pedersen conductance derived with and without the\nPIXIE data. Here we observe that almost all the values are\nlocated at the dashed line. A proportionality factor of 1.007\nmeans that the Pedersen conductance remains very much un-\naffected by the increased electron flux at larger energies, in\naccordance with the results presented in Fig. 3. Effects of\nenergetic electrons occurring at different Joule heating lev-\nels are presented in Fig. 7c, showing a significant reduction\nwhen taking the PIXIE data into account. By performing the\nlinear regression analysis, we find that the Joule heating, on\naverage, decreases by 15%. Though the values vary signifi-\ncantly, with the largest local decrease exceeding 58%.\nIn Fig. 8, we present the geomagnetic indices AE(67),\nAL(67) and Dst (17) from 31 July 1997. The measurements\nfrom PIXIE and UVI covering the time period between 02:00\nand 04:20 UT involve a clear and isolated substorm event.\nAn abrupt intensification was seen in the AE and AL in-\ndices around 02:45 UT, with peak values exceeding 1300\nand \u2212800 nT, respectively.

In the upper row, where the\nPIXIE data have not been included, the images show max-\nima in both the postnoon sector as well as the morning sec-\ntor. After including the energetic electrons from PIXIE, the\nimages in the middle row reveal that the Joule heating maxi-\nmum in the morning sector decreases significantly. However,\nthe maximum in the afternoon sector remains fairly unaf-\nfected, as the precipitation of energetic electrons is negligible\nin these regions, according to Fig. 9.\nFigure 11 shows the same trends as Fig. 5. Both the calcu-\nlated potential drop and Joule heating are reduced when we\ntake into account the energetic electrons. During the most\nactive period after 02:45 UT, the potential drop decreases by\nas much as 13%, while the Joule heating at two occasions de-\ncreases more than 20%. The inferred energy flux increases in\ngeneral around 5% when including the PIXIE data, resulting\nin a decrease in the ratio between Joule heating and energy\nflux by 20 to 30%.\n4.2 31 July 1997\nA scatter plot of the Hall conductance values given in\nFig. 12a shows the distribution of the 1964 data values AMIE\nprovides between 02:00 and 04:20 UT on 31 July 1997.\nThe linear regression analysis reveals that the Hall conduc-\ntance, on average, increases by 13% and with a maximum\nlocal increase of 99% when including the PIXIE measure-\nments. The Pedersen conductance in Fig. 12b remains more\nor less unaffected by the energetic electrons, in accordance\nwith the results presented in Fig. 3 and Fig. 7b. A reduc-\ntion by 19% and a maximum local decrease of about 39%\nis found in Fig. 12c when studying the PIXIE effects on the\nJoule heating values.\n4.3 28 August 1997\nThe geomagnetic indices AE(68), AL(68) and Dst (16) from\n28 August 1997 are presented in Fig. 13. During the\ntime interval between 03:00 and 10:00 UT when measure-\nments from PIXIE and UVI were available, two relatively\nclear peaks can be seen in the AE(68) and AL(68) in-\ndices. The first intensification is rather extended in time\nfrom about 03:30 until 06:00 UT, with AE exceeding 900 nT\nand AL reaching \u2212700 nT. This substorm took place dur-\ning the main phase of a minor geomagnetic storm, as the\nDst (16) decreased from around\u22125 nT at 03:00 UT to around\n\u221248 nT at 05:30 UT. Then the recovery phase commenced,\nas the Dst (16) index started to increase. However, around\n07:00 UT, another intensification was observed as the mag-\nnitude of the AE(68) and AL(68) indices increased sig-\nnificantly, reaching almost 1100 and \u2212800 nT, respectively,\naround 07:55 UT. Thereafter, the activity slowly diminished.\n484 A.

The data values are taken from the regions covered\nby the PIXIE and UVI instruments. The solid line results from a\nlinear regression analysis of the data points.\nIn Fig. 14 we present similar plots, as presented in Fig. 5\nand Fig. 11. Again we note the effects of the energetic elec-\ntrons on polar cap potential, Joule heating and energy flux.\nOverall, the effects are less than the ones found during the\nevent on 26 June 1998, and 31 July 1997. According to\nFig. 14a, the calculated potential drop is generally reduced\nby 5% at most for the first geomagnetic disturbed period be-\ntween 03:00 and 06:00 UT. The inferred Joule heating de-\ncreases by 5 to 10% during the same period, as shown in\nFig. 14b. However, the second intensification after 07:00 UT\nseen in Fig. 13 results in relatively large effects. Figure 14c\nreveals that the ratio between Joule heating and energy flux\nis reduced by about 25% around 08:30 UT. Similar to Fig. 7\nand Fig. 12, we also present in Fig. 15 the distribution of\nconductances and Joule heating values for the 5767 data val-\nues provided by AMIE between 03:00 and 10:00 UT on 28\nAugust 1997.\nBy performing the linear regression analysis, we derive an\naverage increase of the Hall conductance of 7.4%, as given in\nFig. 15a. This result is somewhat lower than the correspond-\ning values of 10 and 13% from the events of 26 June 1998,\nand 31 July 1997, respectively. Figure 15 further shows that\nthe decrease in the Joule heating values caused by the en-\nergetic electrons, on average, reaches 15%, while the Peder-\nsen conductance remains practically unaffected by the PIXIE\ndata.\n5 Discussion\nWe have studied the effects of energetic electrons on iono-\nspheric electrodynamics during periods of substorm activity\noccurring on 31 July and 28 August 1997, and 26 June 1998.\nOn 31 July 1997, we have measurements prior to and\nduring an isolated substorm event. Before substorm onset\naround 02:40 UT, the PIXIE effects are minor, as shown in\nFig. 11. This indicates that the growth phase was dominated\nby less energetic particles, in accordance with the statistical\nstudy by \u00d8stgaard et al. (1999) presented in Sect. 1. Fig-\nure 11 further shows that the effects of energetic electrons\nincrease as the expansion phase commences. \u00d8stgaard et\nal. (2001) and Aksnes et al. (2002) have investigated this sub-\nstorm event thoroughly, showing an eastward drift of the en-\nergetic electrons and the development of a maximum in the\nmorning sector during the recovery phase of the substorm.\nThis explains the significant effects of energetic electrons re-\nducing the estimated Joule heating integrated over the North-\nern Hemisphere by more than 20% and the ratio between\nJoule heating and energy flux by almost 30%. On 26 June\n1998, the effects of energetic electrons are largest during the\nsubstorm event between 05:00 and 06:00 UT, according to\nFig. 5. From Fig. 2, we now observe a shift westward of\nthe Hall conductance maximum. At 05:33 UT, the maximum\nis located around 19:00 MLT. Ten minutes later, we find the\nlargest Hall conductance in the MLT sector 17\u201318. This shift\nwestward may be associated with a westward travelling surge\n(WTS). Ground magnetometer data from the station Barrow\nA. Aksnes et al.: Effects of energetic electrons on ionospheric electrodynamics 485\nFig. 8. The AE, AL and Dst -indices\nbetween 00:00 and 12:00 UT on 31 July\n1997. AE and AL are calculated from\n67 stations between 55 and 76\u25e6 in mag-\nnetic latitudes. Dst is calculated from\n17 stations below 40\u25e6 in magnetic lat-\nitudes. The two vertical dashed lines\nindicate our time interval with data be-\ntween 02:00 and 04:20 UT.\nindicate the appearance of a WTS, as we observe typical fea-\ntures like a negative dip in the H component and a positive\nbay in the Y component. As summarized by Miller and Von-\ndrak (1985), WTS is associated with energetic electrons.\nIn Fig. 14, we show effects of energetic electrons on iono-\nspheric electrodynamics during the event of 28 August 1997.\nThe second intensification starting around 07:00 UT results\nin large differences, in accordance with the results from 31\nJuly 1997, and 26 June 1998. However, we also note that\nthe first intensification this day between 03:00 and 06:00 UT\nonly leads to minor differences. Except for the results around\n04:30 UT, the effects of energetic electrons are less than we\nmight have expected when observing the relatively large in-\ncrease in the geomagnetic indices. This results from the\nfact that the precipitating electrons were mostly less ener-\ngetic during this time period. We note that the AE and AL\nindices peaked at about 900 nT and \u2212700 nT, respectively.\nDuring the second intensification on 28 August, the AE in-\ndex reached almost 1100 nT and the AL index was close to\n\u2212800 nT. The two other events from 31 July and 26 June\nboth show much larger values of the AE and AL indices, as\npresented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 8.\nIn Fig. 16a we give an example of a typical precipitat-\ning electron energy spectrum derived from PIXIE and UVI\nmeasurements.The solid line represents the full spectral char-\nacterization where both PIXIE and UVI data are taken into\naccount. While the lower electron energies are determined\nfrom UVI data, the PIXIE measurements enable us to char-\nacterize the most energetic electrons. Also plotted is a dashed\nline showing the situation without PIXIE data, where the\nUVI derived electron spectrum has been extrapolated to-\nwards higher energies. Such an extrapolation is obviously\nnot sufficient here, as we see a significant drop in the elec-\ntron flux at higher energies. As pointed out in Sect. 1, the\nPIXIE data may sometimes reveal a lower electron flux at\nhigher energies than provided by the extrapolated UVI spec-\ntra. This explains the cases with negative differences when\nincluding PIXIE data in Figs. 2, 3, 7, 9, 12, and 15. Never-\ntheless, from the same figures we can conclude that the sit-\nuation presented in Fig. 16a, showing a higher electron flux\nwhen including PIXIE data, is by far the most typical. In\nFig. 16b we present the effects on the electron energy depo-\nsition from the two situations described in Fig. 16a with and\nwithout PIXIE data. The dashed line giving the height profile\nof the electron energy deposition based on the extrapolated\nUVI derived spectrum falls off steeply below 100 km. At al-\ntitudes lower than 90 km, the electron energy deposition val-\nues are practically insignificant, as the values have dropped\nbelow 10 keV\u00b7cm\u22123\u00b7s\u22121. In comparison, the solid line rep-\nresenting the energy deposition from the electron spectrum\nderived using combined PIXIE and UVI measurements re-\nmains large in the upper part of the D-region and first starts\nto fall off drastically below 80 km. We find that including\nPIXIE data increases the total height-integrated energy de-\nposition by about 40%. However, if we only consider the\nregion below 100 km, the increase is more than 600%.\nIn Fig. 16c, we present similar height profiles of the Hall\nconductance. We note the discrepancy below 100 km, result-\ning in a large difference in the total height-integrated Hall\nconductivity. Without PIXIE data, we derive a Hall con-\nductance of 27 S. By including the information from the X-\nray measurements, the resulting Hall conductance value is\n39 S, an increase of \u223c44%. The importance of the energetic\nelectrons for the Hall conductance has been pointed out by\n486 A.

The differences in per-\ncent when including PIXIE measure-\nments are also presented.\nSchlegel (1988). From two years of EISCAT data, 8337 con-\nductivity profiles were calculated within a height region be-\ntween 90 and 180 km. The maximum Hall conductivity was\nusually located at 109 km. In comparison, the largest Hall\nconductivity in Fig. 16c is at an altitude of 108 km, along\nwith a significant contribution to the Hall conductance at\nlower heights. During times with very energetic particle pre-\ncipitation, Schlegel sometimes found the maximum in Hall\nconductance at heights below 100 km. For such events, the\nconductivity profiles were extrapolated exponentially down\nto 75 km altitude, in order to derive a more accurate height-\nintegrated Hall conductivity.\nFrom Fig. 16, we can conclude that the difference between\nincluding PIXIE data or not may be tremendous in the lower\nE-region below 100 km. Significant effects on physical pro-\ncesses in the lower thermosphere and mesosphere should be\nexpected. When interpreting the results found in this study,\nthough, we need to keep in mind the limitations described\nin Sect. 2.5. First of all, the rather coarse PIXIE resolution\n(600\u2013900 km) prevents us from identifying localized struc-\ntures in the electron precipitation. Secondly, the procedure\nfor establishing electron spectra and thereafter calculating\nionospheric conductances from PIXIE and UVI measure-\nments may also be a source of uncertainty. As explained in\nSect. 2.4., several assumptions and relations have been in-\ncorporated in the computer code used to infer height profiles\nof the ionization. We should therefore be careful when dis-\ncussing ionospheric effects at specific altitudes from the in-\nvestigation performed. Nevertheless, the results presented in\nSect. 4. undoubtedly indicate that the inclusion of PIXIE data\nmay have a large effect on the ionospheric electrodynamics.\n5.1 Effects on the electric field\nThe large-scale ionospheric electric field has its origin in the\ninteraction between the magnetosphere and the solar wind,\nand its configuration depends on the conditions of the inter-\nplanetary magnetic field (IMF). During periods of a south-\nward pointing IMF, a two-cell electric convection pattern is\nestablished at higher latitudes. The electric potential drop\nacross the polar cap is calculated as the difference between\nthe minimum and maximum electric potentials and is often\nused to compare different electrodynamical states. Particle\nprecipitation leads to an enhancement of ionospheric conduc-\ntivities, resulting in electric polarization fields and thereby\na modification of the electric field in the ionosphere locally\n(Bostr\u00f8m, 1973). Significant increases in the Hall conduc-\ntance when including the PIXIE data during periods of sub-\nstorm activity are seen in Figs. 2 and 9. The largest local\neffects of energetic electrons on the Hall conductances reach\nabout 100%, as shown in Fig. 7a, Figs. 12a and 15a. By as-\nsuming that the magnetosphere acts as a current generator,\nthe computational effect of a larger Hall conductance from\nthe AMIE calculations is a reduction of the estimated elec-\ntric field. This has been shown in Figs. 4a, 11a and 14a.\nSuch an anticorrelation between Hall conductance and iono-\nspheric electric field has been reported in several papers us-\ning measurements from rockets (Wescott et al., 1969; Went-\nworth, 1970; Evans et al., 1977; Marklund et al., 1982), satel-\nlites (Shue and Weimer, 1994; Johnson et al., 1998), and\nradars (de la Beaujardie`re et al., 1977; Kirkwood et al., 1988;\nOpgenoorth et al., 1990; Aikio et al., 1993; Lanchester et al.,\n1996).\n488 A.

The data values are taken from the regions covered\nby the PIXIE and UVI instruments. The solid line results from a\nlinear regression analysis of the data points.\n5.2 Effects of proton precipitation\nThe UVI camera is potentially sensitive to protons, as men-\ntioned in Sect. 2.2. According to Frey et al. (2001), LBH\nemissions may contain contributions from proton excitation,\nthough, this should be limited to regions with strong pro-\nton precipitation. Particle observations from polar orbiting\nsatellites (Hardy et al., 1989, 1991; Newell et al., 1991) and\nground-based optical H emission observations (Creutzberg\net al., 1988) show that the proton aurora can be of particular\nimportance in the cusp and at the equatorward boundary of\nthe auroral oval before midnight. Even though the statistical\nstudies by Hardy et al. (1989) and Galand et al. (2001) show\nthat electrons are the dominant source of ionization, protons,\non average, contribute \u223c 15% to the total energy inferred.\nProtons precipitating in the atmosphere are treated as elec-\ntrons in the UVI calculations, as the measured UV-emissions\nare assumed to be caused by precipitating electrons. This\nmay lead to an underestimation of the electron density, ac-\ncording to a study by Galand et al. (1999). Galand et\nal. (1999) investigated the ionization by energetic protons in\nthe auroral atmosphere using the Thermosphere-Ionosphere\nElectrodynamics General Circulation Model (Richmond et\nal., 1992). First, they calculated the ionospheric ionization\ncaused by proton precipitation. Then they treated the protons\nas electrons, and showed that the resulting electron density\nwas being underestimated. The largest difference occurred\naround 130 km, near the region where the Pedersen conduc-\ntivity peaks. This indicates that the Pedersen conductance\nmay change somewhat when treating protons as electrons. A\nproton with an energy of 10 keV will deposit most of its en-\nergy in this height region around 130 km (Rees, 1982). In\ncomparison, an electron with a similar energy of 10 keV can\npenetrate down below 110 km (Rees, 1963). For a proton to\npenetrate down to approximately 105 km where the Hall con-\nductivity is largest, an energy of almost 100 keV is needed\n(Rees, 1982). According to Hardy et al. (1989) the proton\naurora can typically be expressed as a Maxwellian with a\ncharacteristic energy between 1 and 20 keV, indicating that\nthe Hall conductance, in general, should be more or less un-\naffected by proton precipitation. If we assume that precipi-\ntating protons takes place during the three events of 31 July\nand 28 August 1997, and 26 June 1998, this might affect the\ncalculation of Pedersen conductance. However, the possible\nchange in the Pedersen conductance should be the same for\na calculation with and without the PIXIE data, meaning that\nthe proton aurora should not affect the results presented in\nthis study. In order for proton precipitation to make a signif-\nicant impact on the results, we need precipitating protons in\nthe energy range of 100 keV or more. Since the protons do\nnot produce measurable X-rays because of their large mass\ncompared with electrons, we might underestimate the Hall\nconductance during such a situation. Taking energetic pro-\ntons in the energy range of 100 keV into account, we should\nthen find the effects presented in Sect. 4 to be slightly larger.\nA.

The solid line results from a\nlinear regression analysis of the data points.\n5.3 Joule Heating vs. AE\nSeveral studies have investigated and found a nearly linear re-\nlationship between hemispheric integrated Joule heating and\nthe AE index. Such studies are motivated by the fact that\nwe are often only able to provide Joule heating in localized\nregions. A possible relation with a geomagnetic index like\nAE means we can estimate Joule heating continuously over\nthe entire polar region. Papers report a proportionality fac-\ntor between the Joule heating rate and the AE index rang-\ning from 0.16 to 0.54 GW\/nT (Ahn et al., 1983b; Baumjo-\nhann and Kamide, 1984; Richmond et al., 1990; Cooper\net al., 1995; Lu et al., 1996, 1998). The discrepancy be-\ntween the studies may be attributed to the fact that different\nmethods are used to obtain Joule heating and the AE index.\nBoth Ahn et al. (1983b) and Baumjohann and Kamide (1984)\nused the Kamide-Richmond-Matsushita algorithm (Kamide\net al., 1981). However, while Ahn et al. (1983b) derived the\nconductances on the basis of ground magnetic perturbations,\nBaumjohann and Kamide made use of an improved version\n(Kamide et al., 1982) of the statistical conductance model\ndeveloped by Spiro et al. (1982). Like the study presented in\nthis paper, Richmond et al. (1990), Cooper et al. (1995) and\nLu et al. (1996, 1998) applied the AMIE procedure. Though\nRichmond et al. adopted AE(12) in their analysis, the other\npapers calculated AE from the north-south component of\nthe magnetic perturbations measured by all available mag-\nnetometer stations in the high-latitude auroral zone. Cooper\net al. estimated a proportionality factor of 0.54 GW\/nT when\nusing AE(12). However, when using a multistation-derived\nAE from AMIE, they found the relation between Joule heat-\ning and the AE index to be 0.28 GW\/nT.\nWe have done a similar investigation with the studies de-\nscribed here, by performing a linear regression analysis.\nWhen using the Joule heating derived without the PIXIE\ndata, we find the proportionality factors to vary between 0.15\nand 0.26, meaning that we are in the lower end of the results\nfound by others. Including the effects of energetic electrons\nresults in even lower proportionality factors, as presented in\nFig. 17.\nFor the events of 31 July and 28 August 1997, we find\nproportionality factors of 0.15 and 0.13 GW\/nT, respectively.\nOn 26 June 1998, we obtain a somewhat larger value of\n0.23 GW\/nT. While the isolated substorm event of 31 July\ntakes place during a non-storm period and the event of 28\nAugust occurs during a minor geomagnetic storm, the sub-\nstorm activity investigated on 26 June is related to a se-\nvere storm with the Dst index reaching a minimum value\nof \u2212128 nT. The large proportionality factor established be-\ntween the Joule heating and the AE index for the event of\n26 June may be attributed to the intense geomagnetic storm\ncondition for this date. A characteristic of a geomagnetic\nstorm is a strong convective electric field (Gonzalez et al.,\n1994), indicating that the electric field may contribute more\nto the ionospheric current responsible for the AE values dur-\ning storms than during non-storm conditions. As Joule heat-\ning depends strongly on the electric field strength, we should\nA.

(c) Height profiles of\nthe Hall conductivity for the two situa-\ntions presented in (a).\ntherefore expect a larger ratio between Joule heating and AE\nindex during storm periods. When looking at the different\npapers investigating this relationship using the AMIE proce-\ndure, we find such a tendency. Richmond et al. (1990) and\nLu et al. (1996) study non-storm events and find proportion-\nality factors ranging between 0.16 and 0.21 GW\/nT. Cooper\net al. (1995) and Lu et al. (1998) find larger values between\n0.25 and 0.54 GW\/nT when studying storm events. A more\nthorough investigation is needed, though, for this suggested\nrelationship between Joule heating, AE index and geomag-\nnetic storm condition.\nFrom Fig. 17, we see that the linear correlation coefficient\nr is high for all events, ranging from 0.88 to 0.94. However,\nwe should point out that the number of points is limited. For\nthe events on 28 August 1997, and 26 June 1998, we have 34\nand 30 data points, respectively. From the isolated substorm\nevent on 31 July 1997, we have only 10 values. Therefore,\none must be cautious when interpreting the results. Even\nthough the statistics are rather limited, the results neverthe-\nless show that the Joule heating turns out to be lower than\nprevious studies have reported. The events of 31 July and 28\nAugust, operating with proportionality factors of 0.15 and\n0.13 GW\/nT, respectively, provide lower values for the rela-\ntionship between Joule heating and AE than found by oth-\ners studying non-storm events. Likewise, the proportionality\nfactor of 0.23 GW\/nT for the event of 26 June is less than\nthat found by previous studies using data from storm time\nconditions.\n5.4 Effects on energy budget\nWe have found that the inferred Joule heating integrated over\nthe Northern Hemisphere decreases by up to 20 percent when\nenergetic electrons are taken into account. According to\nFig. 5c, Fig. 11c and Fig. 14c, the ratio between Joule heating\nand electron energy flux decreases even more, as the calcu-\nlated energy flux increases when we include the PIXIE data.\nThese results show that auroral energy input by precipitating\nparticles probably contributes relatively more to the total en-\nergy budget than previous papers have reported. One of the\nfundamental questions in space physics involves the energy\ncoupling between the solar wind and the Earth\u2019s magneto-\nsphere. The energy budget during magnetic storms and sub-\nstorms has been evaluated and presented in several papers\nin the literature (Akasofu, 1981; Harel et al., 1981; Stern,\n1984; Tsurutani and Gonzalez, 1995; Lu et al., 1995, 1998;\nKnipp et al., 1998; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2002a). The studies agree\nthat the most important forms of energy dissipation in the\nnear-Earth space are the magnetospheric ring current injec-\ntion, atmospheric Joule heating and the energy flux carried by\nprecipitating particles. However, the relative importance of\nthe different energy forms is still much argued. Most studies\n492 A.

Note that the\nPIXIE data have been included when\nderiving Joule heating presented here.\nThe solid line in each plot represents\nthe result from the linear regression an-\nalyze.\nreport that Joule heating represents by far the largest iono-\nspheric energy sink to the total energy budget. Atmospheric\nheating can affect thermospheric winds and cause vertical\nmotions which, in turn, change the atmospheric composition.\nAnother possible effect is the expansion of the atmosphere\nresulting in increasing atmospheric drag on near-Earth satel-\nlites (AFSPCPAM15-2, 1997). Even though we usually find\nJoule heating to be higher than the precipitating electron en-\nergy flux, our result strongly indicates that the contribution\nfrom auroral particles is more important than that presented\nin most studies considering the energy budget. This is in\naccordance with a recent paper by \u00d8stgaard et al. (2002b).\nThey have investigated the energy dissipation rate during 7\nsubstorms from 1997 by using observations from PIXIE and\nUVI. Nonlinear relations between the energy flux and theAE\nand AL indices have been established and compared with\nsimilar linear relations performed by others. The result by\n\u00d8stgaard et al. (2002b) is much in accordance with a paper\nby Lu et al. (1998). However, \u00d8stgaard et al. (2002b) find\nvalues which are a factor 1\u20132 times larger than the results by\nSpiro et al. (1982) and Richmond (1990), and about 4 times\nlarger than reported in studies by Akasofu (1981) and Ahn et\nal. (1983b).\nA. Aksnes et al.: Effects of energetic electrons on ionospheric electrodynamics 493\nTable 1. We present the largest changes in percent of the different electrodynamical parameters when including energetic electrons derived\nfrom the PIXIE data during the three events on 31 July 1997, 28 August 1997, and 26 June 1998. The largest changes in the local values of\nHall conductance and Joule heating are found in regions of limited extent, as demonstrated in Fig. 2, Fig. 6, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10. We have\nexcluded values less than 10 S and 10 mWm\u22122, respectively, to avoid effects caused by statistical uncertainties.\nLargest effects of energetic electrons during the event of:\n31 July 1997 28 August 1997 26 June 1998\n02:00\u201304:20 UT 03:00\u201310:00 UT 03:00\u201308:00 UT\nLocal Hall Conductance 16H 99% 84% 138%\nLocal Joule Heating 1QJ -39% -47% -58%\nPolar Cap Potential Drop 18PC -13% -9.2% -12%\nHemispheric Integrated Joule Heating 1QJ -21% -20% -17%\nHemispheric Integrated Energy Flux 1QA 8.6% 6.7% 7.4%\nRadio Between Joule Heating and Energy Flux 1QJ \/QA) -27% -25% -22%\nIn Figs. 5c, 11c and 14c, the ratio between the hemispheric\nintegrated Joule heating QJ and energy flux by precipitating\nparticles QA is presented. By integrating the total contribu-\ntions from these two ionospheric energy forms throughout\nthe respective time periods with measurements and then cal-\nculating the ratio QJ \/QA, we estimate the largest ratio of\n1.67 for the severe storm event of 26 June 1998. This value\nis much larger than the corresponding average ratios of 1.04\nand 0.955 for the events of 31 July and 28 August 1997, in-\ndicating that the energy flux by the precipitating particles is\nof special importance for substorm events occurring during\nnon-storm periods or minor geomagnetic storms. It is in-\nteresting to note that an inclusion of the neutral wind in the\nAMIE calculations would probably lead to less Joule heating\nvalues and, therefore, even lower ratios between Joule heat-\ning and energy flux by precipitating particles. Lu et al. (1995)\ninvestigated the effects of neutral wind on Joule heating for\n28\u201329 March 1992, when several intensifications could be\nseen in the AE index. On the average, for this two-day pe-\nriod, the hemispheric integrated Joule heating was reduced\nby 28 percent due to the neutral wind.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this study we have investigated the effects of energetic\nelectrons on ionospheric electrodynamics. This was done by\nrunning the AMIE procedure using UVI and magnetometer\ndata and then investigating energetic electrons by repeating\nthe study and including PIXIE data. We find that the im-\nproved spectral characterization of the precipitating electrons\nusing PIXIE data most often results in a larger electron flux\nat higher energies and consequently, a higher Hall conduc-\ntance. The increased Hall conductance then leads to a re-\nduction in the estimated electric field, and we find that the\ncalculated polar cap potential drop sometimes decreases by\nmore than 10% during geomagnetic disturbed periods. This\nfurther affects the estimation of Joule heating, which may\nbe 20% lower on a global scale. In some localized regions,\nJoule heating can decrease by more than 50%. Including the\nPIXIE data increases the energy flux of precipitating particles\nby approximately 5%, resulting in a decrease in the calcu-\nlated ratio between Joule heating and energy flux, sometimes\nby more than 25%. The largest estimated effects of ener-\ngetic electrons during the three events studied in this paper\nare presented in Table 1.\nWe note that the inclusion of the PIXIE data affects the\ncalculation of Hall conductance, polar cap potential, Joule\nheating and energy flux, while the estimated Pedersen con-\nductance is hardly affected at all.\nThe relationship between Joule heating and the AE index\nhas also been studied in this paper. In accordance with pre-\nvious studies, we find a nearly linear relationship between\nthese two quantities. However, our investigation gives pro-\nportionality factors between Joule heating and the AE in-\ndex ranging from 0.13 and 0.23 GW\/nT. We suggest that\nthe largest value of 0.23 GW\/nT derived from the event of\n26 June 1998, may be attributed to the geomagnetic storm\nconditions during this day. A more thorough investigation is\nneeded, though, for this proposed relationship, as only three\nevents have been studied in this paper. By comparing our\ndata with the results found by others considering storm and\nnon-storm conditions, respectively, we obtain lower values of\nthe ratio between Joule heating and AE index than reported\nin previous studies. An investigation has also been performed\nregarding the relative importance of the ionospheric energy\nsinks. For the severe storm event of 26 June 1998, the hemi-\nspheric integrated Joule heating represents the largest energy\nform and contributes 1.67 times more than the hemispheric\nintegrated energy flux by precipitating particles. However,\ncorresponding ratios of 1.04 and 0.955 are found for the\nevents of 31 July and 28 August 1997, indicating the impor-\ntance of the auroral particle precipitation to the energy bud-\nget for substorm events occurring during non-storm or minor\ngeomagnetic storm periods.\nAcknowledgements.
