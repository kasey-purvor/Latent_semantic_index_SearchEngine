Respondents were \nrandomised by team to one of four groups to receive: theory-based intervention; evidence-based \ncommunication; patient-based intervention; no intervention (control). Interventions were delivered \nas pen and paper exercises at the start of a second postal questionnaire that re-measured the \nsame psychological variables. The outcome measures were intention and scenario-based \nbehavioural simulation. \nResults \nResponses were received from 644\/1103 (58%) individuals from 179\/205 (87%) mental health \nteams. There were no significant differences in terms of intention or simulated behaviour between \nthe trial groups. The theory-based intervention significantly increased scores for attitudes to \n(p=0.03) and perceived behavioural control (p=0.001) for the behaviour of \u201cfinding out what the \npatient already knows or suspects about their diagnosis\u201d.  \nConclusions \nThe intervention had a limited effect. This may be partly explained by clinical or methodological \nfactors. The use of a systematic intervention modeling process allows clearer understanding of \nthe next appropriate steps which should involve further evaluation of the interventions using an \ninteractive delivery method in a less selected group of study participants. [ISRCTN15871014]. \n 3 \nKeywords: Intervention modeling, dementia.  \n \n 4 \nIntroduction \nAn international consensus group estimated that in 2001 the global prevalence of dementia was \n24.3 million. Modeling what would happen in 2020 and 2040 they predicted that almost 5 million \nnew cases would occur every year (Ferri et al., 2005). These incidence rates coupled with \npopulation demographics are predicted to result in a doubling of the number of cases every 20 \nyears. Dementia is associated with major social and economic costs, including those to families \nand carers. The UK National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People states that the improved \ncare of people with dementia depends on early recognition and management (Department of \nHealth, 2001). A recent national clinical practice guideline in the UK has re-emphasised the need \nfor such care to involve a sensitive and accurate explanation of the diagnosis to individuals and \ncarers, with information about the likely prognosis and possible packages of care (National \nCollaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2007).  \nAppropriate disclosure of a diagnosis to individuals with dementia is important for three reasons. \nFirst, from an ethical perspective, people with dementia have a right to know their diagnosis. At \npresent, most carers are told the diagnosis (Audit Commission, 2002) but this is not the case for \npeople with dementia themselves (Bamford et al., 2004). Indeed, disclosure is less likely in \ndementia than in other terminal conditions, such as cancer. Earlier disclosure, supported by \nadvocacy groups, allows the opportunity to plan family, fiscal and long term care arrangements. \nSecond, many people with dementia want to know their diagnosis or receive more information \nabout their illness (Jha, Tabet, & Orrell, 2001; Marzanski, 2000; McWilliams, 1998). Third, \ndisclosure can facilitate decisions about treatment. However, whilst this is increasingly important \nwith the advent of therapies to slow disease progression, anecdotal evidence suggests that \npatients prescribed anti-dementia medication are not always told their diagnosis. A systematic \nreview of disclosure practice indicates wide variation in the reported practice of disclosure of \ndementia among health professionals (Bamford et al., 2004). Four main factors appear to \ninfluence disclosure: patient characteristics (e.g. age, perceived ability to retain the diagnosis); \nnature of the dementia (e.g. severity, diagnostic uncertainty, the appropriateness of using \ndisease-slowing therapies); structural factors (e.g. time); and clinician factors (e.g. perceived \n 5 \nvalue of disclosure) (Bamford, May, Eccles, & Bond, 2001; Downs, Clibbens, Rae, Cook, & \nWoods, 2002; Fortinsky, Leighton, & Wasson, 1995; Heal, 1998; Johnson, Bouman, & Pinner, \n2000; Rice & Warner, 1994; Rice, Warner, Tye, & Bayer, 1997; Vassilas & Donaldson, 1998).  \nIt is a consistent finding that changing clinical practice is unpredictable and can be a slow and \nhaphazard process. There is now a sizeable body of literature suggesting that a range of \ninterventions (e.g. reminder systems, interactive education) can be effective in changing health \ncare professionals\u2019 behaviour (Grimshaw et al., 2001). However, substantial heterogeneity in \ninterventions used, targeted behaviours, and study settings means that generalising findings to \nroutine healthcare settings is problematic - there is no underlying generalisable taxonomy for \neither research or service settings by which to characterise individuals, settings and interventions \n(Foy, Eccles, Jamtvedt, Grimshaw, & Baker, 2005). To avoid perpetuating this situation \nsystematic, replicable approaches to intervention building are required.  \nThat clinical practice is one form of human behaviour and can be described in terms of general \ntheories relating to human behaviour offers the basis for a generalisable classification of methods \nto change clinical behaviours. These may be influenced by modifiable factors such as health \nprofessionals\u2019 \u2018attitudes\u2019 or \u2018perceived control\u2019 over their practice \u2013 and so interventions to change \nthese factors may change behaviour. Thus generalisable (theory-based) concepts can lead to \nreplicable interventions that can be used across different contexts. Two steps are necessary to \ndesign a theory-based intervention for a behaviour change trial (Walker et al., 2003). One is to \nidentify modifiable factors underlying professional behaviour in order to identify which factors to \ntarget with an intervention and the second is to understand how interventions might work and be \noptimised.  \nAs a method of achieving this Collins and colleagues (Collins, Murphy, Nair, & Strecher, 2005) \nproposed a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). They describe this as \u201chaving three \nphases: (a) screening, in which randomized experimentation closely guided by theory is used to \nassess an array of program and\/or delivery components and select the components that merit \nfurther investigation; (b) refining, in which interactions among the identified set of components \nand their interrelationships with covariates are investigated in detail, again via randomized \n 6 \nexperiments, and optimal dosage levels and combinations of components are identified; and (c) \nconfirming, in which the resulting optimized intervention is evaluated by means of a standard \nrandomized intervention trial.\u201d  \nWe have developed an intervention modeling process within which important constructs are \nidentified and manipulated and their impact on interim measures, such as stated intention, is \nmeasured (Bonetti et al., 2005; Bonetti et al., 2003) using an intervention modeling experiment \n(IME). This corresponds to MOST\u2019s phases (a) and (b). Given that a consistent and predictable \nrelationship has been demonstrated between intention and behaviour in studies in general \n(Armitage & Conner, 2001; Sheeran, 2002; Webb & Sheeran, 2006) as well as in studies of \nhealthcare professionals (Eccles, Hrisos et al., 2006; Godin, Belanger-Gravel, Eccles, & \nGrimshaw, 2008) an intervention modeling process aimed at changing intention offers the \nadvantages of smaller size and efficiency in developing and testing candidate interventions prior \nto proceeding to full scale randomised controlled trials (MOST Phase 3). \nThis paper describes the final phase of a larger study. The aim of the overall study was to use \nexplicit and replicable methods to develop and evaluate a theory-based intervention targeting \nmodifiable factors to increase diagnostic disclosure of dementia by members of old age mental \nhealth teams (OAMHTs). The study had a number of discrete steps outlined in the study protocol \n(Eccles, Foy et al., 2006). First, we identified elements of a model of good clinical practice and \nfrom these identified three key behaviours in the disclosure of diagnosis of dementia (Lecouturier \net al., 2008). We then measured, within two theoretical frameworks, the factors that predicted the \nself-reported intention to enact these key behaviours (Foy, Bamford et al., 2007). These two \nphases of the project are summarised below.  On the basis of these results we developed a \ntheory-based intervention (Foy, Francis et al., 2007) the evaluation of which is the subject of this \npaper.  \nWe identified the potential elements of a model of good clinical practice from: a literature review; \n10 face-to-face interviews (four with people with dementia (in two of these the person\u2019s informal \ncarer was present), and six with informal carers only); and a stakeholder panel of \nprofessionals\/advocates from a range of disciplines (two old age psychiatrists, one clinical \n 7 \npsychologist, one social worker, two primary care doctors, one community psychiatric nurse and \none carer support worker).. Together these three sources identified over 200 discrete behaviours \nthat were grouped into seven categories: preparing for disclosure; exploring the person with \ndementia\u2019s perspective; negotiating shared understandings; responding to the person with \ndementia\u2019s reactions; focusing on health promotion and quality of life; negotiating management \nstrategy; communicating effectively. This list was reduced using a two-stage Delphi process and \nthe following criteria: the behaviours should cover different facets of the disclosure process; they \nshould be from the stake-holder panels\u2019 higher ranked behaviours; they should be important to \npeople with dementia and carers; there should be benefit from performing the behaviour; and \nthere should be the potential for change. Finally three key behaviours were selected: [1] finding \nout what the patient already knows or suspects about their diagnosis; [2] using the actual words \n\u2018dementia\u2019 or \u2018Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2019 when talking to the patient (i.e. the use of explicit \nterminology); [3] exploring what the diagnosis means to the patient (Lecouturier et al., 2008).  \nThen, by postal questionnaire survey, we measured, within two theoretical frameworks, factors \nthat predicted self-reported intention to enact these key behaviours by 399 members of 85 \nOAMHTs (Foy, Bamford et al., 2007). Overall, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen, \n1991) explained intention better than Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (Bandura, 1986).  For \nexploring what the patient already knows or suspects, the TPB variables of subjective norm, \nperceived behavioural control and attitudes explained 29% of the variance in behavioural \nintention.  For the use of explicit terminology, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and \nattitudes explained 54% of the variance in intention.  For exploring what the diagnosis means to \nthe patient, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control explained 49% of the variance in \nintention.  In a regression model entering all variables (from both theories) modestly improved \nprediction of intention to perform the three behaviours (to 35%, 63% and 52% respectively). From \nthese results we developed a theory-based intervention (Foy, Francis et al., 2007).  \nThis paper describes the randomised controlled trial evaluating the theory-based intervention \nalongside two pragmatic interventions. Thus this was a modeling experiment within an overall \nintervention modeling process. With the primary outcome of intention we included planned \n 8 \nexplanatory mediational analyses to assess whether interventions successfully changed targeted \nmediating factors and whether these factors in turn accounted for any changes in the primary \noutcome. \nMethods \nDesign and participants \nThis was a four-arm randomised controlled trial of the effect of one theory-based and two \npragmatic interventions on the intentions of a random sample of members of OAMHTs in \nEngland, administered by postal survey (Eccles, Foy et al., 2006). Although disclosure of a \ndiagnosis of dementia might predominantly be the responsibility of consultant old age \npsychiatrists, we recognised the roles of other professionals in this process (e.g. community \npsychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists) and therefore invited all the professionals in each \nOAMHT to participate.  \nRandomisation \nPre-intervention questionnaires were mailed to all members of OAMHTs. Teams from which \nresponses were received were randomised to one of four groups to receive the study \ninterventions detailed below. Randomisation was by computer generated numbers and was \nconducted by the study statistician.  \nOutcome measures \nTable 1 summarises the outcome measures. For each of the three disclosure behaviours the \nprimary outcome measure was intention. For each behaviour, intention was measured by two \nquestions of the form \u201cI intend to \u2026\u201d and \u201cIn my practice I expect to \u2026\u201d. These were rated on 7-\npoint scales from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. Responses were averaged and scaled so \nthat a high score indicated a high intention.  \nA secondary outcome of behavioural simulation was measured post-intervention for two of the \nbehaviours. For using the actual words \u201cdementia\u201d or \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d; and exploring what \nthe diagnosis means to patients it was possible to write brief clinical scenarios; it was not possible \nto write a credible scenario for the behaviour of exploring what the patient already knows or \nsuspects. Respondents were asked to rate, on a five-point scale from Definitely to Not at all likely, \n 9 \nwhether they would perform the two behaviours for each of 10 clinical scenarios.  \nExplanatory variables \nTable 1 summarises the explanatory measures. The theories (Theory of Planned Behaviour \n(TPB) (Ajzen, 1991), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (Bandura, 1986)) and the theoretical \nconstruct of Implementation Intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999) and the reasons for choosing them are \ndescribed and discussed in the study protocol (Eccles, Foy et al., 2006). Implementation \nIntentions have been used in the past in the form of an intervention rather than a questionnaire \nitem. As we began to operationalise Implementation Intentions in a questionnaire format we \ndecided there was a real danger of the questions becoming a co-intervention so decided not to \nproceed with this potentially confounding strategy. Within the Theory of Planned Behaviour, as \nwell as asking questions about instrumental attitudes (perceived costs and benefits), there were \nalso a number of questions asking specifically about affective attitudes (how it would feel to \nperform each behaviour) (Crites, Fabrigar, & Petty, 1994).  \nQuestionnaire items measuring psychological variables were initially developed from previously \nrecommended scales and items (Ajzen, 1991; Bandura, 2000) as well as from qualitative analysis \nof interviews with people with dementia and carers.  \nUnless otherwise stated, all questions were rated on a 7-point scale from Strongly Disagree to \nStrongly Agree. In order to reduce the likelihood of response sets, some items were reverse-\nworded and responses reverse-scored. \nThe interventions \nIntervention content \nThree interventions were developed: a theory-based intervention, which incorporated recognised \nbehaviour change techniques matched to targeted theoretical constructs, and two pragmatic \ninterventions included as examples of \u201ccommonsense\u201d interventions that a healthcare provider \ncould develop and introduce without theory or prior evaluation with the intent of improving the \nface validity of the overall experiment for participants. All three interventions were designed to \nwork across all of the behaviours on the basis that, although we had disaggregated behaviours \nfor the purposes of intervention development, when they came to be delivered in a service setting \n 10 \ntrial they would be more or less aggregated into a single (though potentially multi-faceted) \nintervention.  \nThe development of the theory based intervention has been described in detail elsewhere (Foy, \nFrancis et al., 2007); the intervention components are illustrated in Table 2. In summary, the \nresults from a previous questionnaire study (Foy, Bamford et al., 2007) were used to identify \nconstructs that explained the highest proportion of variance in intention: attitudes to the \nbehaviour, subjective norm (i.e. perceived pressure from social sources) and self-efficacy. Using \na systematic process (Michie, Johnston, Francis, Hardeman, & Eccles, in press) those behaviour \nchange techniques that were judged most likely to change the constructs were identified. As a \nresult of this process, we used the technique of persuasive communication to target both \nsubjective norms (describing evidence that professional colleagues were in favour of disclosure) \nand attitudes (describing evidence of positive consequences of disclosure). In addition, we used \ntwo techniques to target self-efficacy: behavioural modeling was presented as descriptions of \nmethods used successfully by other professionals; a graded task asked participants to identify \nmethods of tackling disclosure in their next step in a hierarchy of situations of increasing difficulty \nof disclosure.   \nThe first pragmatic intervention replicated the frequently used technique of offering evidence-\nbased information to healthcare professionals. The evidence-based communication was an A4 \nsize page, formatted as the inside cover of the questionnaire, describing evidence around the \nfollowing seven issues associated with disclosure of a diagnosis of dementia: many people with \ndementia want to know their diagnosis; most people with dementia thought it helpful to have been \ntold their diagnosis; people given a diagnosis of dementia develop positive ways to cope with \ntheir diagnosis; being given a diagnosis confirms some patients\u2019 own suspicions; lack of \ninformation can cause distress; there is little evidence of catastrophic reactions to being told the \ndiagnosis; the negative consequences of disclosure are no greater or more persistent than those \nof other serious diagnoses.  There was no specific instruction to read the information. \nThe second pragmatic intervention took the form of a patient leaflet that could be sent in advance \nof an initial outpatient appointment and that contained prompts about the nature and content of \n 11 \nquestions that the person might like to ask. Designed as a three panel patient leaflet, formatted \nonto a single side of A4, it had three sections. The first offered brief information on possible \ncauses of memory problems (including Alzheimer\u2019s disease\/dementia). The second provided \nspace where the person was invited to write down their ideas about the causes of their memory \nproblems. The final section offered examples of questions that they might ask during their \nconsultation and provided space for them to write down additional questions of their own. \nRespondents were asked to \u201cimagine that all patients being assessed for a diagnosis of dementia \nhave received [this leaflet] in advance of their appointment or meeting with you\u201d. \nIntervention targets \nThe target variables for the theory-based intervention were attitudes, subjective norm and self-\nefficacy.  For the two pragmatic interventions, we used a consensus process within the research \nteam to specify which predictor variables the interventions might target. Before any experimental \nresults were available two researchers (CB and JF) used a grid to independently categorise \nwhich constructs and behaviours were targeted by each aspect of the interventions. A third \nresearcher (RF) arbitrated during a second round of rating to resolve any disagreement. The \nevidence-based information intervention was judged to mainly target the behaviour of \u2018using the \nactual words\u2019 and to strongly target attitudes and weakly target subjective norm. The patient \nleaflet intervention addressed all three behaviours and mainly targeted subjective norm, \nperceived behavioural control and self-efficacy.  \nIntervention delivery \nAll the interventions were presented as \u2018pen-and-paper\u2019 exercises that were formatted as the front \npages of the follow-up questionnaire. We assumed that respondents would read and perform the \nactivities within the interventions and then move on to answer the subsequent cognitions \nquestions. Questionnaires incorporating the three interventions are available from the \ncorresponding author.  \nSample size and analysis plan  \nThe sample size for a four armed trial, powered to detect a difference between any two arms, was \nbased upon the following assumptions: OAMHT as the unit of analysis; the outcome variable \n 12 \n(intention or simulation) in the form of a score for the team; 80% power; and a type 1 error rate of \n2.5% (rather than 5% to allow for multiple comparisons). Furthermore, we aimed to detect a \nrelatively large effect size of 0.8 on the basis that the modeling experiment eliminates some of the \nsources of variability associated with a \u2018service based trial\u2019 (e.g. patient characteristics) and any \nsmaller modeling effect size is unlikely to translate into a worthwhile effect in a subsequent \nservice based trial. Therefore, we required four groups of 30 teams (120 teams in total). We \nsurveyed 240 teams to allow for a 50% response rate in order to achieve the required sample \nsize.  \nThe primary outcome of interest was the intention to perform each of the three behaviours. \nSecondary outcomes included a measure of behavioural simulation for two of the behaviours and, \nfor all three behaviours, each of the psychological constructs described in Table 1.   \nEach variable was analysed using multilevel modelling with health care professionals nested \nwithin mental health care teams. The dependent variable was the score at follow up and where \navailable the score at baseline was included as a covariate. Variation between health care \nprofessionals and variation between health care teams were modelled as random effects with \nnormal distributions. Differences between the four arms of the study were fitted using three \ndummy variables corresponding to each of the active interventions. Models were fitted using the \nstatistical package MLwiN version 2.02 using an iterative generalised least squares estimation \nprocedure. For each outcome the following two step procedure was adopted. First an omnibus \ntest of overall variation between the four study groups was undertaken using a likelihood ratio test \n(the change in -2 log likelihood was compared against the percentage points of a chi-squared \ndistribution). Secondly, when this variation was significant at the 5% level, the differences \nbetween the four groups were explored further. \nPostal Questionnaire administration  \nWe ascertained the general composition of mental health teams from contacts, usually service \nmanagers, local to the teams.. We then wrote an open letter to all professionals, which was \ndelivered via these contacts, and asked those who agreed to participate to complete and return \nan \u2018opt-in\u2019 form. All potential participants were offered an incentive (\u00a320 (approximately $40) gift \n 13 \nvoucher) enclosed with the initial questionnaire. We asked respondents to complete \nquestionnaires independently (i.e. not together in teams). We posted up to three reminders to \nnon-respondents. \nRespondents to the initial questionnaire were sent the second questionnaire which contained \ntheir allocated intervention and the second set of questions. Data on simulated practice was \ncollected only in the second postal questionnaire. All other variables were collected in both \nquestionnaires. \nEthics approval.  \nThe study was approved by the Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland and by the \nResearch and Development offices of the participating NHS Trusts. \nResults \nParticipation and response rates \nInitial invitation letters were posted out to 2843 individuals in 258 teams. A total of 948 individuals \nfrom 199 teams returned pre-intervention questionnaires and 644 individuals from 179 teams \nreturned post-intervention questionnaires (mean 3.6 respondents per team; range 1-17). Based \non baseline responses, the overall mean response rate was 87% for teams and 58% for \nindividuals (Table 3).  \nThere was some evidence that response rates varied by trial arm ( 1.1023 =\u03c7 , p = 0.02) and by \nprofessional group ( 5.1425 =\u03c7 , p = 0.01). These effects were independent (the difference \nbetween trial arms could not be attributed to variation in response rates by professional group). \nThe breakdown of post-intervention respondents by job category is shown in Table 3. As we were \nnot allowed (by the Ethics Committee) to have access to details of individuals prior to their opting \ninto the study we cannot report an analysis of initial non-responders. There were no significant \ndifferences in gender, years experience of working with people with dementia or baseline \nintention scores between responders and non-responders to the post-intervention questionnaires.  \nEffect of the interventions \nThe results are shown in Table 4. There were no significant differences in intention or simulated \n 14 \nbehaviour between the four randomised groups. The theory-based intervention significantly \nincreased scores for instrumental attitudes (p=0.03) and perceived behavioural control (p=0.001) \nfor the behaviour of \u201cfinding out what the patient already knows or suspects about their \ndiagnosis\u201d.  \nAs the theory-based intervention relied on respondents engaging with the various steps in the \nintervention we analysed responses to identify the number of sections of the intervention that \nwere fully completed, partially completed or not completed. Fifty-four percent of respondents \ncompleted all of the intervention sections as intended. A further 21% attempted all sections but \nonly partially completed some sections; 25% left some sections uncompleted. The other two \ninterventions were presented in a format that just required them to be read by participants so we \nhad no way of quantifying the level of engagement with these interventions. \nDiscussion \nWithin an explicit and replicable intervention modeling process three interventions each failed to \nchange intention or behavioural simulation scores in relation to performing three important \nbehaviours in the process of disclosing a diagnosis of dementia to patients. The theory-based \nintervention was designed to change attitudes, subjective norms and self-efficacy. For one of the \nthree behaviours of interest, it significantly increased scores for instrumental attitudes and \nperceived behavioral control, a construct that is conceptually very close to the targeted construct \nof self-efficacy and which is theorized to have a direct effect on behaviour. Nevertheless it failed \nto shift the theoretically predicted dependent variable of intention.  \nGiven that we comfortably exceeded our required sample size, possible explanations for the lack \nof effect are: (a) study participants not engaging with the interventions; (b) the method of delivery \nwithin the modeling experiment and (c) ceiling effects from intention already being relatively high \nand the linked issue that therefore the factors influencing behaviour may be \u201cpost-intentional\u201d (i.e. \nrelating to difficulties translating intentions into action). Each of these has implications for future \nwork with these interventions and how an intervention modeling process might be used in the \nfuture. \nGiven our analysis of engagement with the theory-based intervention it is unlikely that lack of \n 15 \nengagement was a major factor, at least for this intervention. With 75% engaging totally or \npartially with all steps in the intervention we can be confident that respondents went through the \nprocesses we planned. However, the theory-based intervention group had a significantly lower \nresponse rate to the second questionnaire than the other three trial groups suggesting that some \nsubjects found it difficult to, or did not wish to, engage with the greater complexity of the theory \nbased intervention delivered in this paper-based format. As indicated in the results, it is possible \nthat lack of engagement was a factor for the other two interventions. \nIntention scores were relatively high with two of the key behaviours having mean intention scores \nacross all four groups within (or almost within) one standard deviation of the top of the scale. This \nsuggests that the potential for any of the interventions to increase intention in this population may \nhave been limited. The position with the targeted constructs (with the exception of self-efficacy) \nwas similar. However, across all the trial groups there was a substantial non-response at the two \nstages of the postal survey. It is possible that we were working with more motivated individuals \nwho had higher intention scores and the interventions may have a different effect with a group \nwhose intention scores were lower. Within evaluations non-response will always be an issue and \nhaving taken all reasonable steps to reduce it the final step would be to characterize non-\nresponders and compare them with responders. A particular feature of this study was the \nrecruitment method constraints imposed by the ethics committee because of which we are \nunfortunately unable to say much about the attributes of our non-responders. \nFinally, for the theory-based intervention, it is possible that, despite getting respondents to \nengage with the steps in the intervention, the postal, paper-based self-administered nature of the \nintervention was not \u201cpotent\u201d enough. Whilst it took them through the various stages of the three \nbehaviour change techniques that we used (Table 2) the techniques are more commonly used in \ninteractive contexts. Based on the results of this paper-based experiment a logical next step \nwould be to deliver the same intervention components in a small group format to members of the \nsame mental healthcare team.  \nThe Theory of Planned Behaviour proposes that intention and perceived behavioural control are \nthe immediate precursors of behaviour. For one of our behaviours we did significantly increase \n 16 \nperceived behavioural control and it is possible that this could result in a change in behaviour by \nvirtue of its theorized direct effect on behaviour. However, in the face of a less than perfect \nrelationship between intention and behaviour it is recognized that there are other factors that \ninfluence behaviour that can operate in the gap between intention and behaviour (Sheeran, \n2002). Knowing that the behaviours are not being routinely enacted, the relatively high intention \nscores for at least two of the behaviours raise the possibility that the way to increase rates of \nperforming the behaviours is to intervene on factors operating in the gap between intention and \nbehaviour. Such factors include situation-behaviour associations that become salient as a result \nof planning interventions. For example, a plan in the form, \"When I first discuss a diagnosis of \ndementia with a patient [situation] I will suggest a follow up appointment to explore what the \ndiagnosis means to the patient [behaviour]\" would strengthen the situation-behaviour association \nand make it more likely the situation would act as a prompt for the associated action. There is \nevidence that other relevant modifiers of the intention-behaviour relationship are intention \ncertainty, past behaviour, self-schema and anticipated regret. In addition, whether the behaviour \nis more likely to be influenced by internal factors (e.g., attitudes) or by external factors (e.g., \nperceived normative constraints) is important and, finally, temporal stability of intention appears to \nbe key (Sheeran & Abraham, 2003). The fact that we did not include explicit measurement of \nsuch factors nor aim any of the interventions at them may have limited the experiment. However, \nthere is a limit to how many theories can be included and operationalised within a single \ninstrument and we already had problems with response rates.  One future possibility to consider \nis a hypothesized theoretical framework for the study of healthcare professionals' behaviour and \nintention that was described on the basis of a systematic review of studies of healthcare \nprofessionals (Godin et al., 2008). The two social cognitive models that we used claim to be able \nto account for non-volitional factors. They posit that such effects are mediated through their effect \non the included theoretical constructs such as attitudes within TPB or self efficacy within SCT. \nTherefore with no effect on intention or behavioural simulation, but with an effect on perceived \nbehavioural control for one behaviour we conclude that, for this study\u2019s participants it is unlikely \nthat the interventions as delivered in the experiment would be effective in the real world.  \n 17 \nThe intervention modeling process, of which this experiment formed one part, has the major \nadvantage of transparency. In this stage of the process we were able to examine the effects on \nthe targeted constructs as well as the chosen outcome measures. In addition, the use of a \nmodeling experiment, with proxy outcomes, was less resource-intensive than a full trial. In the \nlight of the null result this study suggests that these interventions should not be taken forward into \na service level trial (MOST\u2019s phase c (Collins et al., 2005)) at this point. Rather, they should be \nfurther examined addressing the shortcomings of recruitment and method of delivery. Even with \nthe advantages of the intervention modeling process there are still a range of methodological \ndevelopments that need to occur before it can be regarded as a stable method and as an \neffective and efficient \u2018filter\u2019 to decide which are the most promising interventions to take through \nto a full-scale, real-world trial.  \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to all members of mental health teams who participated in the study.
