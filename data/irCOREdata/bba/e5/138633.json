For this material, we have shown at high shock \nstresses, a two component wave was formed consisting of a fast moving ramped \nportion and a slower moving shock wave. Changing the thickness of test specimen for \na given shock stress resulted in a change in the magnitude and duration of the ramped \nportion of the wave front. As the shock stress imparted to the target was reduced, or \nthe thickness of the target was increased, the steep shock wave in the rear surface \ngauge was no longer apparent. Instead a relatively slow rising wave was measured. \nConsequently, to establish a Hugoniot at lower shock stress levels, relatively thin \nspecimens of target material are required. \n \nKeywords: A.

Most of the work to date has \nconcentrated on relatively low velocity impact studies [e.g 1-6], sphere penetration \nstudies [e.g. 7-14], dynamic tensile and compression tests using servo-hydraulic \nmachines [15-17] and split-hopkinson pressure bar studies [18-23]. Relatively few \nstudies have been done examining the shock behaviour of carbon fibre-based \ncomposites and in particular, how the shock wave propagates along the fibre \ndirection.  \nUnderstanding how shock waves propagate in these materials is key to our \nunderstanding of how these materials respond to high velocity impacts such as those \nfrom fragmenting munitions. In particular, there is a requirement to know how the \nshock propagates in different directions in these anisotropic materials. Understanding \nthe shock propagation along the in-fibre direction is of particular importance for when \nthe material is subjected to highly oblique impacts. At sufficiently high impact \nvelocities, such a loading condition would result in a shock wave that propagated in a \ndirection parallel to one of the fibres. \nAttention has been given to examining the shock in the through-thickness \ndirection where the direction of all of the fibres is perpendicular to the loading axis. \nDandekar et al. [24] have conducted plate impact experiments on an S2-based GFRP \nmaterial in the through-thickness direction and shown that the compression curve, as \nmeasured in pressure \u2013 particle velocity space, of the GRFP lay in-between that of the \nmaterial\u2019s constituent parts. Their results also indicated that there was a linear \nrelationship between shock velocity (Us) and particle velocity (up) of the form \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 3 \n \nps SucU += 0        (1) \n \nwhere c0 and S are the shock parameters. A linear Hugoniot in shock velocity \u2013 \nparticle velocity space occurs for a wide range of materials [25] including the RTM6 \nresin used in the manufacture of these CFRP laminates [26]. It has also been observed \nby other researchers studying the shock propagation in the through-thickness direction \nof carbon fibre composites [27] and glass fibre composites [28]. Tsai et al. [29] also \nstudied the shock behaviour of GFRP laminates. In this work they tested the shock \nbehaviour of different thicknesses of GFRP in the through-thickness direction. They \nused a multibeam VALYN\u2122 VISAR (Velocity Interferometer System for Any \nReflector) laser interferometer to measure the particle velocity at the rear surface of \nthe targets. They noticed a distinct knee in the velocity time profile during the rise \ntime of the particle velocity profiles in each of the four experiments. Furthermore, the \nslope of the velocity time profiles after this knee decreased with the thickness of the \nGFRP target i.e. with the distance of wave propagation. The stress level at which the \nslope change occurred decreased with increasing GFRP thickness. It was noted that \nthis phenomenon was similar to the elastic-precursor decay observed in elastic-\nviscoplastic materials and for the case of the GFRP tested was understood to be due to \na result of both material and geometric dispersion of the shock wave. \n Some attention has also been given to examining the response in the \nin-fibre direction. That is, when one of the fibre directions is orientated parallel to the \nloading axis.  Eden et al. [31] studied the shock behaviour in a 3D quartz phenolic \ncomposite. In this work, they used a streak camera to visualise the wave propagation \nin the specimen. Their results also showed that there was a clear distinction between \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 4 \nthe wave moving in the fibres orientated with the shock propagation direction and the \nwave moving in the matrix suggesting that the fibres were acting as wave guides. \nHolmes and Tsou [32] investigated the shock response of a composite consisting of \nunidirectional aluminium fibres cast in an epoxy matrix. Again, the fibres were \norientated parallel to the loading axis. They showed that the measured shock \nvelocities were constant over a range of thicknesses indicating that the shock itself \nwas steady. Using a streak camera, they noticed a slight waviness in the shock front \nwith a periodicity that corresponded to the fibre spacing. Again, this suggested that \nthe fibres themselves were acting as wave guides. Changing the volume fraction of \nthe aluminium fibres from 25 % to 60 % resulted in their data points falling on \ndifferent Hugoniots as predicted by the analysis of Tsou and Chou [33]. \nMillett et al. [27] also studied the effect of orientation on a woven CFRP \nlaminate on its shock behaviour. Using very similar materials and experimental \ntechniques to this work, they showed that in the through-thickness orientation, the \nmaterial behaved as though it was a simple polymer. When one of the fibre directions \nwas orientated parallel to the loading axis, very different behaviour was observed. The \nstress pulse had a pronounced ramp, before at sufficiently high stresses, a much faster \nrising shock occurred above it. Millett et al. [28] also showed similar behaviour in a \nGFRP material. Similar behaviour was also observed by Hereil et al. [30] who studied \nthe shock response of a 3D carbon-carbon composite. They showed that the response \ncould be decomposed into two separate waves. The first wave is transmitted by the \nlongitudinal fibres and the second wave corresponds to the shock travelling in the \n\u2018matrix\u2019, that is, all other constituents of the composite including fibres that ran \nperpendicular to the longitudinal fibres. \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 5 \nIn this work, we report experiments that have been conducted to examine the \nshock behaviour of an aerospace-grade woven CFRP laminate so that one of the fibre \ndirections is aligned perpendicular to the planar shock that is generated on impact by a \nflyer-plate. The objective of this work was two-fold:  (a) to evaluate the effect of \nsample thickness on the shock propagation in a woven laminate and, (b) to measure \nthe Hugoniot along the in-fibre direction. This work is part of a wider study on the \ndynamic behaviour of CFRP laminates. \n \nEXPERIMENTAL \n \nMaterials used \n \nThe materials chosen for this study were woven CFRP laminates that were \nmanufactured using the resin transfer method (RTM). The panel was manufactured \nwith Hexcel G0926 Carbon Fabric with a 5 harness satin weave. The resin used was \nHexcel RTM 6 cured for 1 hour 40 minutes at 180 \u00b0C and at a pressure of 100 psi. \nThe CFRP panel was 6 mm thick and made from 16 plies with the lay-up sequence \n(0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, 0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, \n0\/90). The density of the CFRP material, measured using a Micrometrics AccuPyc \n1330 gas pycnometer, was 1.512 g\/cc \u00b1 0.001 g\/cc. The mass fraction of the \nreinforcement was measured using the acid digestion method according to ASTM D \n3171-6, Procedure B. [34] and was found to be 69.7\u00b11.0% \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 6 \nExperimental technique \n \nAll the experiments were conducted using the 50-mm single-stage light gas \ngun [35].  Dural (Al 6082-T6) and copper flyer plates were accelerated to velocities of \nbetween 643 m\/s and 826 m\/s and were used to dynamically load prepared CFRP test \nspecimens.   \nTen carbon fibre composite panels, each with a cross-section of 60 mm \u00d7 6 \nmm were stacked and glued together using a two-part epoxy adhesive (Hysol\uf6da 0151). \nAs the shock impedances for common epoxy resins are similar to that of the RTM6 \nresin used in the manufacture of the laminate [26], it was deemed that the addition of \nthe Hysol would not affect the end result. Indeed, this approach was successfully used \nby Millett et al. [27, 28]. From this block, 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mm thick target samples \nwere cut and lapped to \u00b15\u00b5m. The micrograph in Figure 1 shows a portion of the \nsurface of a prepared target specimen, and the two directions of fibres are clearly \nvisible.  Note that in this micrograph, the loading axis is in the direction through the \npage. \nTwo types of experiments were conducted. Firstly, targets of thicknesses 1.5 \nmm, 3.0 mm, 6.0 mm and 9.0 mm were each impacted such that a similar shock stress \noccurred in each of the target specimens. Apart from the 9.0 mm specimen, the test \nspecimens were instrumented with a single manganin pressure gauge (LM-SS-\n125CH-048), encapsulated between two PMMA layers.  This gauge was located on \nthe opposite face to that impacted, and thus recorded the stress history after the shock \nhad passed through the test specimen (see Figure 2(a)); the 9.0 mm specimen also \nincluded a front surface gauge. The PMMA was necessary, as noted by Millett et al., \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 7 \nto protect the gauge from premature failure. Calibration of the gauges was to \nRosenberg et al. [36]. \nIn the second set of experiments, the test specimens of thickness 3.0 mm, 6.0 \nmm and 9.0 mm were loaded to different stress levels by varying the velocity and \nmaterial of the flyer, as noted above.  In these experiments, two encapsulated \nmanganin gauges were fixed to both faces of the target specimen so that the shock \nvelocity could be recorded. The first gauge was fixed at the interface between a cover \nplate (of the same material as the flyer) and the test specimen.  This gauge was \nencapsulated between two layers of Mylar 50 \u00b5m thick, to provide electrical \ninsulation and to give mechanical protection. The second gauge, located at the rear of \nthe target, was fixed between a layer of PMMA c. 1.5 mm thick, and a PMMA block \nof c. 12 mm thick, so that the thinner PMMA layer was in contact with the test \nspecimen. A typical target set-up is given schematically in Figure 2(b). \nBefore firing, the thickness of each test specimen was carefully measured, so \nthat the distance between the gauges was accurately known.  By measuring the time \nof arrival of the shock at each gauge, the (assumed constant) shock velocity (Us) \ncould be calculated from the transit time (\u2206t) of the shock across the specimen taking \ninto account the offset distance of the rear embedded gauge from the rear of the target \nspecimen and the shock behaviour of PMMA [37]. Hugoniot data for our flyer-plate \nmaterials were taken from Marsh [38] and the velocities of the projectile were \nmeasured by using a sequential pin shorting system to an accuracy of 0.5%. Fast \ndigital storage oscilloscopes (2 GS\/s) were used to capture the arrival and shape of the \nshock; subsequent data reduction and analysis was done on a PC.  The impedance \nmatching technique [39] was used to derive the particle velocity behind the shock \ngiven the measurements noted above. \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 8 \n \nFigure 1 NEAR HERE  \n \nFigure 2 NEAR HERE  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nAs noted by Millett et al. [27], unlike isotropic single-phased materials, the \nshock structure as recorded by the manganin gauges along the fibre direction is \ncomplex. Figure 3 shows the stress histories recorded by the two manganin gauges in \nan experiment where a 5-mm thick copper plate impacted the target at a velocity of \n811m\/s. The front-surface gauge was encapsulated in a 50 \u00b5m Mylar package and the \nrear gauge was protected from the composite by 1.62 mm of PMMA.  It can be seen \nthat initially, the front gauge senses the shock propagating through the target \nassembly and eventually fails (1) probably due to the gauge being punctured by the \nlongitudinal carbon fibres.   \n \nFigure 3 NEAR HERE \n \nThe reason for the change in slope (2) towards the top end of the initial shock is \nunclear. Other traces showed a break in slope around this region and may suggest \nfailure of the adhesive layer between the gauge package and the CFRP. The spurious \nnoise at (3) is due to the front gauge failing and the inevitable subsequent cross-talk \nbetween the gauges. Consequently, the second gauge continues to pick up interference \nfor the duration of the experiment. At (4) the rear face gauge observes a relatively \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 9 \ngentle slope to approximately 1.1 GPa. This has been observed by other researchers \nexamining the shock response of a 3D carbon-fibre composite material [30]. Here the \nlow amplitude ramp was interpreted as being a high velocity wave transmitted along \nthe fibres orientated parallel to the loading axis. Measurements from an experiment \nusing a 3-mm thick sample, indicate a propagation velocity of 6.2 mm\/\u00b5s for the onset \nof the ramped portion.  Previous analysis by Millett et al. [27] has concluded that the \narrival time of the onset of this low amplitude ramp corresponds to a transit velocity \nof ca. 7 mm\/\u00b5s regardless of shock stress, although they noted that his data showed \nconsiderable scatter.  They suggested that if this wave had been transmitted down the \nfibres, it would be largely elastic in nature. At a stress of approximately 1.1 GPa, \nthere is a sharp rise to maximum stress (5), which is attributed to the arrival of the \n\u2018main shock\u2019 that is transmitted through the \u2018matrix\u2019 composed of the binder and the \nfibres not aligned parallel to the loading axis. Finally, the maximum stress is reached \nin the PMMA encapsulation before the arrival of the release wave (7). \nThe stress history shown in Figure 3 is typical of the experiments in which the \nimpact velocity and flyer material were chosen to form a stress of 5-6 GPa in the \ntarget, and where the target specimens were of 6 mm or greater thickness.  However, \nin those experiments where the impact stress was lower, the structure of the stress \nhistory on the back surface gauges did not resemble that of a fast rising shock as seen \nin Figure 3. Furthermore, due to the presence of the cross-talk from the front gauge \nthere was considerable uncertainty in the interpretation of the physical processes. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 10 \nThe effect of sample thickness on the shock behaviour \n \nTo investigate the physical processes further, we conducted a series of three \nwell-resolved experiments using the test specimen set-up shown in Figure 2(a) where \nthere was no front gauge.   In these experiments, 5-mm thick copper flyers impacted \nthe target specimens a fixed velocity of c. 700 m\/s. The thicknesses of the specimens \ntested were : 1.52 mm, 3.00 mm, 6.05 mm. These data were compared to data from a \nprevious experiment on a 9.06 mm thick specimen that used the set-up shown in \nFigure 2(b). With this thicker specimen an aluminium flyer impacted the target at 824 \nm\/s to produce a shock stress in the target that was similar to the thinner targets \ntested. This particular experiment also included a front surface gauge in an attempt to \nevaluate the wave velocity. However due to the presence of the front gauge, that \nfailed at an early stage of the experiment, some spurious noise was produced. \nConsequently an FFT was applied to the data to remove the offending high frequency \ncomponents (50- 570 MHz). All other traces presented required no such filtering. A \nsingle manganin gauge encapsulated by the PMMA layers was placed on the rear face \nof the target to record the stress history after its passage through the test specimen. \nThe stress histories for all four experiments are shown together in Figure 4.  Note that \nthe time axis has been adjusted so that all four traces are coincident, and that the \nstresses are recorded in the PMMA protection at the rear of the specimen, rather than \ndirectly in the target material. \n \nFigure 4 NEAR HERE \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 11 \nIt can be seen that, as the target thickness increases, the ramped portion of the \nstress history becomes more pronounced.  The durations of the ramped portion are \n0.08 \u00b5s, 0.26 \u00b5s, 0.53 \u00b5s and 0.81 \u00b5s for target thicknesses of 1.52 mm, 3.00 mm, \n6.05 mm and 9.06 mm respectively. The magnitude of the ramped portion (measured \nfrom the onset of the ramp until the change to a steeper slope) also increased with \ntarget thickness, with magnitudes of 0.69 GPa, 1.00 GPa, 1.15 GPa and 1.50 GPa for \nthe four experiments conducted.  Note however, that Millett et al. [27] showed that for \nan impact of 936 m\/s by a copper flyer on a 10 mm thick sample, the ramped portion \nterminated at a stress of 1.09 GPa at a time of 785 ns after onset, for an impact stress \nof 5.75 GPa \u2013 a higher impact stress than recorded in Figure 4.  This suggests that the \nmagnitude and duration of the ramped phase of the stress recorded at the rear surface \nof the target specimen was dependent upon both the target thickness and the impact \nstress. This part of the wave form has previously been attributed to be the fast moving \nlargely elastic portion in the fibres. However the increasing length and magnitude and \nshape of this part of the wave demands explanation. One possibility is that energy is \ncontinuously being lost from the fibres into the surrounding matrix material. \nConsequently this ramped portion is initially a sharp elastic rise that is smeared with \ndistance. Indeed, this is consistent with the decrease in the gradient that is seen with \nthe 1.5 mm, 3.0 mm and 6.0 mm sample and to a lesser extent, with the 9.0 mm \nsample. However, we should point out that a certain amount of caution should be \napplied in interpreting this result (for the 9.0 mm sample) due to the filtering that was \napplied. On the other hand, the nature of ramped portion may be attributed to the \ncomplexity of the laminate design used in this experimental programme. Fibre \nwaviness and the presence of the +\/- 45\u00b0 fibres will both result in a variable arrival of \nthe wave at the manganin gauge leading to a gradual increase in resistance (and \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 12 \ntherefore stress) in the gauge material.  However it is difficult to reconcile this latter \nexplanation with the observed magnitude and duration of the ramped portion.  \nThe relatively sharp rise after the ramped portion of the stress histories \n(attributed to the arrival of the wave propagating through the \u2018matrix\u2019) is observed to \nterminate at a decreasing stress as the target thickness increases. This stress is \nindicated by the arrows in Figure 4. Beyond this point, the stress continues to rise at a \nslower rate up to a maximum of 2.8 GPa.  This implies that as the shock is travelling \nthrough the thickness of the material, it is being dispersed. Note too, the reduction in \nthe gradient as the thickness of the material is increased. Tsai et al. [29] studied the \nstructure of shock waves in S2-based polymer reinforced composites of varying \nthicknesses. They noted that as the thickness of the material was increased, there was \na noticeable slope change in the profile of the pulse. The stress level at which the \nslope change occurred decreased with increasing GFRP thickness and was thought to \nbe due to the dispersive nature of these materials. Although Tsai et al. was not \nexamining the in-fibre behaviour, their work correlates with these results. It is \ninteresting to note that the dispersion of the shock occurs for a 6 mm thick sample at \nc. 700 m\/s (with a Cu flyer) but not at higher velocities of impact for the same \nthickness. This result suggests that the dispersion of the shock is dependent on the \nthickness of the target as well as the strength of the shock with weaker shocks being \nmore susceptible to dispersion. \nThere are two possibilities behind this dispersion. Firstly, energy is being \ndeposited into the matrix before the shock arrives.   Due to the relatively low \nimpedance of the surrounding resin, and the low transverse dimension in the rods, the \nstate of strain in the carbon fibres will cease to be 1D at a short distance from the \nimpact surface. As previously discussed the waves propagate along the fibres, energy \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 13 \nis lost to the surrounding matrix prior to the arrival of the shock in that material \nleading to the wave dispersion observed in Figure 4. Another possible explanation is \nthat, wavelets emerging from the carbon fibres result in a state of complex ringing \nbetween fibre bundles in the matrix leading to a state that is unable to sustain a shock \nwave in the material. That is, unless the shock is of sufficient magnitude (as occurred \nwith the high velocity shots) or the ringing is relatively small (as occurred for our thin \ntargets). Changing the fibre spacing would, if this was the case, affect the behaviour \nof shock propagation. \nFinally, we note that the thinner thicknesses tested reach a Hugoniot stress of \n2.6 GPa in the PMMA whereas the 6.05-mm thick sample is subjected to a higher \nstress. Although the reason for the higher stress is not clear, it maybe due to the \ndispersive nature of the wave leading to a longer duration initial \u2018hump\u2019. \nConsequently, the Hugoniot stress is not achieved due to the arrival of the release \nwave from the rear of the 5-mm thick Cu flyer.  Note too that the 3.00-mm thick \nsample Hugoniot stress is slightly higher than the 1.52-mm thick sample stress. This \nis consistent with the slightly higher impact velocity in this case.  \n \nThe in-fibre Hugoniot \n \nAs we have shown, it is possible to observe a reasonably well-defined shock in \nthe back surface gauge if the separation between the two gauges is reduced.  Using \nthis technique, it was possible to establish a Hugoniot along the in-fibre direction.  \nThis is shown below in Figure 5: the error bars indicate the uncertainty in our \nmeasurement of the shock arrival times at each gauge (and hence the measured shock \nvelocity) due the presence of spurious noise occasionally picked up by the rear gauge \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 14 \nas the front gauge failed. For most materials a linear fit can be used to describe the \nshock particle velocity relationship over a limited particle-velocity range according \nEquation 1. Indeed, Millett et al. found that the Hugoniot for the CFRP laminate in the \nthrough-thickness direction could be described by Equation 1 and showed that the \nparameters of c0 and S were 3.23 mm\/\u00b5s and 0.92 respectively.  The Hugoniot is \nshown in Figure 5 and includes three data points where a fast rising shock wave was \nmeasured in the rear gauge by Millett et al. The measured values of S and co were \n2.27 and 2.26 mm\/\u00b5s respectively over the limited particle-velocity range of interest, \nand for shocks along the fibre direction.  This Hugoniot is similar to the RTM6 resin \nused to manufacture these CFRP laminates where the measured values of S and co \nwere 1.55 and 2.65 mm\/\u00b5s respectively [26]. However, the resin has a bulk density of \n1.14 g\/cc as opposed to 1.51 g\/cc measured for this CFRP resulting in a different \nshock impedance. Data points for the resin, over the particle velocity range of interest \nare also included in Figure 5 for completeness. \n \nFigure 5 NEAR HERE \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nA series of plate impact experiments have been conducted on a CFRP laminate \nwhere the plane of impact was perpendicular to one of the fibre directions. These \nresults showed that at high shock stresses, a two component wave was formed \nconsisting of a fast moving ramped portion and a slower moving shock wave. \nChanging the thickness of test specimen for a given shock stress resulted in a change \nin the magnitude and duration of the ramped portion of the wave front. As the shock \nstress imparted to the target was reduced, or the thickness of the target was increased, \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n 15 \nthe steep shock wave in the rear surface gauge was no longer apparent. Instead a \nrelatively slow rising wave was measured. However, reducing the spatial separation \nbetween the front surface and backs surface gauges resulted in the shock being \nmeasured. We were able to observe shock propagation in c. 3.0 mm thick samples that \nwere subjected to a shock stress as low as c. 3.4 GPa. Consequently, using data from \nMillett et al. [27] we were able to establish the in-fibre Hugoniot for this material over \na limited particle-velocity range and it was given by Us=2.27+2.26up (\u00010 = 1.512 \ng\/cc).  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n \nThe authors would like to thank Mr Keith Campbell of Short Brothers plc, \nBelfast, UK for supplying the CFRP panels.
