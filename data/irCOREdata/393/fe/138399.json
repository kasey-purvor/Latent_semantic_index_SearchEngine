Teamworking is turned to with a growing disillusion with knowledge management approaches that are seen as excessively `hard', `objectified', or `information technology dominated'. This paper is a critical review, the purpose of which is to survey the literature across several fields that provide insights into teamworking aspects of knowledge management, and the reverse.

The article attempts to draw together some principles from current\nthemes such as collective mind, modularity, cross-functional teams and communities of\npractice.\n3The two themes of teamworking and knowledge management have attracted great interest\nand generated large literatures. This journal has previously published excellent reviews\non cross-functional teams in new product development (Holland, 2000), principles of\nteamwork (Salas et al., 2000), while several articles have reviewed different aspects of\nknowledge management (Reid et al., 2001; Staples et al., 2001, Harris, 2001; Bontis,\n2001; Gallupe, 2001; Beamish & Armistead, 2001). This article is a critical review, the\npurpose of which is to survey literature across several fields that provide insights into\nteamworking aspects of knowledge management, and the reverse. This approach is\nchosen as disciplines tend to sustain presumptions and preoccupations that may be\ncontradicted by other fields, as shall be shown. In particular, the review challenges what\nis referred to as the \u2018Organisational Behaviour Textbook Theory of Teamworking\u2019 and\nrefers to research and theory from several disciplines that qualify what is still an\ninfluential orthodoxy. The article attempts to draw together some principles from current\nthemes such as collective mind, modularity, cross-functional teams and communities of\npractice.\nThe teamworking and knowledge management fields are increasingly converging. Grant\n(1996a; 1996b) a proponent of a Knowledge-Based View of the Firm, argues that\nknowledge is the pre-eminent resource for competitive advantage in the current era, and\nstresses the role of co-ordination mechanisms to integrate the specialist knowledge of\nmultiple individuals in an organisation. Nonaka & Takeuchi (1995) stress the importance\nof teamwork in the conversion of personal, tacit knowledge into organisational\nknowledge. Dialogue, discussion and dynamic interaction enabled by teamwork are\nargued to play a vital role in the knowledge creation process. The ideas of individuals are\n4articulated, challenged, refined and once converted into organisational knowledge,\nembodied into new products, processes or services. Teamworking is turned to with an\nincreasing disillusion with knowledge management approaches that are seen as\nexcessively \u201chard\u201d, \u201cobjectified\u201d, or \u201cInformation Technology -dominated\u201d (c.f.\nBlackler, 1995; McDermott, 1998; Tsoukas, 1998; Cook & Brown, 1999; Scarbrough &\nSwan, 2001).\nThe next section sets out the view of teamworking that might be described as a received\northodoxy in the field of organisational behaviour, and some research that challenges its\nassumptions. Section Three refers to the concept of \u201ccollective mind\u201d from the literature\non cognition, it shows that efficient teamworking is less a function of group identity as\n\u201cheed\u201d, and stresses the importance of the content of knowledge composed in a team.\nTeamworking under complexity is covered in Section Four, reviewing the debates over\nmodular architecture in products and organisation. Section Five considers the popular\nphenomenon of cross-functional teamworking and discusses the benefits and drawbacks\nof such organisation. Section Six addressed teamworking and identity, emphasising the\nimportance of the team member as a gatekeeper to external communities of practice. A\nsummary of the review in the form of three key propositions is presented in the\nconclusions.\nThe Organisational Behaviour Textbook Theory of Teamworking\nWhere would one reasonably expect to find theory and research on teamworking and\nknowledge management that is practical and useful for managers? For example, one\n5might turn to the organisational behaviour (OB) textbooks of the type that are standard\nissue on MBA courses (e.g. Champoux, 1996; Martin, 1998). Here we find a theory of\nteamworking, where the importance of group cohesion is stressed. Cohesive groups\nperform better than non-cohesive ones and also need less management from above; the\n\u201cself-managing team\u201d idea. Factors affecting cohesive group formation typically include\na number of behavioural factors allowing social interaction: proximity; members not\nphysically isolated; members not physically tied to workspace; high-required interaction;\nlow noise level; incomplete job description; free time at work; low degree of attention\nrequired, low absenteeism. Factors restricting social interaction and group cohesion are\nthe opposites of these listed factors.\nKnowledge bases or the dynamics of learning do not figure as a primary concern in the\nOB Textbook Theory of Teamworking. Instead, there is an emphasis on softer,\ninterpersonal dynamics. Perhaps the most important variable is the basis for attraction\nbetween individuals in the group. This is influenced by interests, education, background,\nage, ethnicity and so on, as well as social interaction among group members, which helps\nform sentiments about colleagues. All other things being equal, people are attracted to\nothers that are similar to themselves with regard to these characteristics. These\nsentiments and interpersonal attraction in general, the textbooks argue, increase\ncohesiveness.\nHowever, psychological research supports only part of the OB textbook theory. Mullen &\nCopper (1994) show that group cohesiveness and performance are strongly correlated,\nand more so in small groups than larger ones. It also shows that the more time group\n6members have to interact with each other the greater the \u201cgroupness\u201d among them, this is\nattributed to \u201ca history of information and experience\u201d (1994: 213) carried by the\nmembers. However, the research also shows that commitment to task is the most critical\ncomponent of cohesiveness, ahead of factors like interpersonal attraction and group pride.\nThe OB textbook orthodoxy would appear to overestimate the effect of these softer,\nsocial aspects on performance improvement as a result of cohesiveness. It may well be\nthat the need for social affiliation is an indirect incentive for effective teamworking, but\ninterpersonal group dynamics do not appear to be a primary factor. Another challenge to\ntextbook orthodoxy is that the direction of causation is stronger from performance to\ncohesiveness, rather than cohesiveness to performance. In other words successful\naccomplishment of the task strengthens the group\u2019s cohesion more significantly than the\nreverse. The social interactions and relationships are secondary, contrary to textbook\ntheory where causation clearly runs from cohesiveness to performance, e.g. Martin:\n\u201cGroups must come to terms with their own internal functioning before they can\neffectively address the tasks facing them.\u201d (1998: 202).\nThe ex ante design of teams has motivated a large body of work focused on group\nstructure. Perhaps the best known is Belbin (1993) which suggests team role archetypes\nthat determine group effectiveness. These roles refer to qualities or tendencies in\nindividuals, such as confidence in co-ordinator types, discipline in implementers, or\nattention to detail in completers. The idea is that when brought together, the nine roles\noffer a complete range of the necessary capabilities for effective teamworking. Roberts &\nFusfeld (1987) identify five similar roles necessary for innovative project teams; idea\ngenerating; championing; project leading; gatekeeping and coaching. Rather than innate\n7tendencies or personality traits, the individual generally adopts each of these roles\ndepending on her stage of career, suggesting that roles are more fluid and accessible than\nBelbin\u2019s model. The role of gatekeeper derives from Allen\u2019s (1984) identification of the\nimportance of individuals who consistently serve to import new technological\ninformation into an organisation. Allen also points to evidence that greater cohesion in a\ngroup tends to discourage external contact and influence, which is vital to the high-\nperforming teams in his study. This further undermines the value of cohesion as stressed\nin the OB textbook theory. In later sections this article will return to the crucial need for\nopenness to external knowledge and influence in effective teamworking.\nPrescriptive Organisational Development (OD) books aimed at practitioners stress the\nvirtues of teamworking and the methods to build teams (Woodcock & Francis, 1994;\nLarson & LaFasto, 1989). Here again interpersonal dynamics are primary, while\nknowledge is not assigned a high significance. Larson & LaFasto do discuss competence\nof team members as being an important factor in team effectiveness. They distinguish\nbetween technical competencies and personal competencies. Technical competences are\n\u201cthe minimal requirement on any team. They refer to the substantive knowledge, skills\nand abilities related to the team\u2019s objective. They are what a team member must know\nand be able to do well in order to have a reasonable chance of achieving the team\u2019s\nobjective.\u201d (1989: 62). However, the discussion lacks some depth, examples offered, such\nas communications skills would seem to fit better into the personal competencies\ncategory. Common features of competent team members are \u201cnot so well defined\u201d; one\nprimary technical skill identified for an effective epidemiologist team member is simply\n\u201can individual prepared to think right.\u201d (1989: 70).\n8Team roles and team building are essentially behavioural, rather than cognitive in nature.\nThis is to be expected in the field of organisational behaviour, however, an understanding\nof managing knowledge in teams will require insight into not only the behaviour,\ninteractions and \u201cgroupness\u201d of the team, but also the content of the individuals\u2019\nknowledge bases and the effects of these working interdependently. One would hope to\nunderstand the rationale for combining the knowledge bases, and the benefits and\nproblems presented by their combination. For such insight we will turn to the literature\non cognition in teams.\nThe Cognitive Perspective: The Thinking Team or Collective Mind\nLiterature on the cognitive dimension of teamworking refers to teams developing a\n\u201ccollective mind\u201d. For Cooke et al. (2000), \u2018team knowledge\u2019 comprises shared mental\nmodels of the task domain, its procedures and conceptual apparatus as well as the team\nsituation; the specific knowledge of behaviours involved in working with the other team\nmembers in the dynamic environment. A well-developed understanding of the shared\nmental model and team situation is argued to predict team performance. Ciborra (1993)\nsuggests that aside from the tasks, control, co-ordination and incentives that impact on a\nteam\u2019s effectiveness, there are also very real effects of identity and enculturation. Once\nthe individual\u2019s identity is with the team, cognition is entrusted to it both with repetitious\nroutines and even for life and death decisions. Through familiarity with solving problems\nand thinking collectively the team constructs a system of interpretation and sense-making\nthat increasingly \u201cthinks\u201d on behalf of the individuals in it.\n9This view of collective mind appears to suggest that group cognition increases in\nassociation with group identity. However, Ciborra warns that this can become\ndysfunctional to the extent of eliminating individual creative thinking; the \u201cgroupthink\u201d\neffect. This is supported by Weick & Roberts\u2019 (1993) research, which suggests that group\nformation and mind formation are distinct processes. For them, collective mind occurs\nthrough alertness, attentiveness and connection among team members; when three crucial\naspects are effected by the individuals; contribution to, representation of, and\nsubordination to the activity system of the group. The authors suggest that \u201cgroup mind\u201d\nemerges when these three aspects are conducted with `heed\u2019. While habit is a replica of\nits predecessor, `heedful\u2019 routines are conditioned by predecessors but each performance\nis novel and the actors are continually learning.\nAs a group matures practices may become more institutionalised, routinised and habitual,\nsuch that individuals contribute less that is addressed to other team members needs,\nrepresent others in less detail, and interact less with them. The boundaries of individuals\u2019\nactivity systems are consequently narrowed. Attention is on local issues, rather than the\nsystem as a whole, interrelating becomes careless and collective mind gradually\ndissipates.\nCrucially Weick and Roberts maintain that the development of mind is a separate process\nfrom the development of the group. Group mind is often strongest in the earliest stages\nwhen a group identity in the OB Textbook Theory sense has not yet been established. As\nindividuals interrelate more smoothly and predictably and become comfortable in their\n10\ninteractive routines, the collective mind may well be eroding. Strong groups can have no\ncollective mind, while collective mind can exist with no strong group identity, as in the\ncase of ad hoc project-based teams, or groups of \u201cjamming\u201d musicians.\nWeick & Roberts\u2019 contribution is strong on the internal dynamics and development of\ncollective mind and in particular the induction of new entrants, but are less concerned\nwith the content of the individual knowledge bases that are collected; what is known and\nhow it is learned (Spender, 1998). The role of expertise, for example, is not a factor in the\ndevelopment of their conception of collective mind. On the combination of individual\nknowledge bases in a team, Hutchins\u2019 (1993; 1995) work is particularly instructive.\nHutchins presents empirically-grounded analysis of \u201csocially-distributed cognition\u201d in\nteams, challenging the presumption that individual competences are necessarily\nheterogeneous and complementary. Instead, the research shows individual knowledge\nbases that overlap or subsume others. In Hutchins\u2019 (1993) example of navigation teams,\nthe individuals accumulate expertise as they move on through all the knowledge domains\nof the group. The result is an amount of \u201credundancy\u201d in the system in that knowledge\nbases of the team members are shared. It is this overlap or redundancy that makes\nteamworking more efficient.\nIn Hutchins\u2019 account of the distribution of tasks in navigation teams, it is shown that\namong experienced experts there is little need for articulation and communication; a few\nwords and gestures suffice. This is a collective mind but not of the instantaneous variety\nallowed by Weick & Roberts\u2019 heedful interrelating. The emphasis here is on the content;\nof what is known. This is tacit knowledge that truly is shared, but only because the team\n11\nmembers have learned the task-related knowledge individually. Group efficiency reduces\nwhere novices are involved and communications needs are increased. In other words,\nefficiency is compromised the more that knowledge needs to be articulated in order that\ninformation may be correctly understood, and appropriate actions need to be prompted\nand demonstrated. For this reason it is often more efficient not to distribute tasks with\nhigh degree needs for communication across two or more people at all, thus reducing\nunnecessary interpersonal dynamics. This does open the hazard of overburdening the\nexperts however.\nThe value of Hutchins\u2019 contribution is as a response to the \u201cgreater than the sum of its\nparts\u201d platitude so common in superficial writing on teamworking and knowledge\nmanagement. As he shows, \u201cIt is not the case that two or more heads are always better\nthan one.\u201d (1995: xvi) Where the content of the heads are quite different, the implications\nof their necessary interactions on workflow need to be considered. This is not simply a\nproblem of \u201ctransfer\u201d of knowledge from one head to another, as is often presented in the\nKM literature. The process of individuals internalising unfamiliar knowledge domains is\nnot a matter of \u2018copy and paste\u2019 but painstaking learning for each individual.\nThe group cognition literature stresses the factors that enable group task execution and\nthe dynamics of individual knowledge bases in interaction. Hutchins, in particular\nstresses learning and expertise in the team, and there are implications also for the\ngeneralist vs. specialist issue. While Hutchins\u2019 experts are generalists in that they have\nacquired deep knowledge of several group tasks, in more complex settings, such overlap\nand redundancy is unfeasible (Cooke et al., 2000). This is addressed in the next section.\n12\nTeamworking under Complexity\nFollowing the trend for teamworking to improve speed, quality and efficiency in\nmanufacturing environments, it has also been advocated as an organisational design for\ncomplex organisations (Galbraith, 1994) that are performing \u201cknowledge work\u201d as\ndistinguished from repetitive production (Mohrman et al., 1995). The increasingly broad\nneeds for technical knowledge bases in Multi-Technology Corporations have been shown\nempirically (Patel & Pavitt, 1994; Granstrand et al., 1997). In addition the growing\nimportance of Complex Products and Systems (CoPS) in modern economies requires the\nintegration of disparate technical and professional knowledge bases in the production of\nthese large capital goods (Hobday, 1998; Marshall & Sapsed, 2000). This means that\nindividuals cannot possibly absorb all the requisite knowledge domains for their team\u2019s\nactivities. \u201cGeneralists\u201d in aerospace engineering teams, for instance, consider\nthemselves more substitutable than their specialist colleagues (Jones & Jordan, 1998), by\ncontrast to the guru status of the generalist in Hutchins\u2019 navigation teams.\nThe complexity of knowledge is argued to be one driver for the trend towards the\noutsourcing of subassemblies and modularity in production (Sanchez & Mahoney, 1996;\nBrusoni & Prencipe, 2001). Sanchez & Mahoney suggest that a modular product\narchitecture may entail a modular organisational design, for example, in component\nsupplier networks. However, such a one-to-one relationship between product architecture\nand organisation is not supported by Brusoni et al. (2001) who emphasise that the\nknowledge bases of firms reach far beyond the boundaries of their production activities.\n13\nAt the firm level, Brusoni et al. argue that knowledge is typically broader than is required\nfor operating activities, encompassing knowledge associated with those modules that are\nroutinely outsourced.\nSanchez & Mahoney\u2019s idea is applied to internal-to-the-firm, team-based organisation by\nGrant (2001) offering the example of Microsoft\u2019s Internet browser development as\norganising around a modular product architecture; small teams deployed to work on\nindividual modules of the system, which were regularly integrated (Cusumano, 1997).\nGrant argues the efficiency of such a system is a response to the costs of knowledge\nintegration- modularity achieves integration across a broad range of different knowledge\nbases while minimising the costs of knowledge transfer. Each team unit integrates the\nknowledge of the individuals within it, without the need for continual transfer to other\nunits. Interfacing between the team-units becomes the second organisational task after\nestablishing modular architecture. This model derives from Herbert Simon\u2019s (1999)\ndescription of \u201cnearly decomposable\u201d hierarchic systems. This is where subsystems\nbehave independently in the short run, but retain weak linkages with other subsystems\nwith which they are interdependent (on aggregate) in the long run.\nHowever, as Grant (2001) suggests it is the messy interfaces between sub-units of\nmodular organisation that are not well understood. While the modular organisation\nargument is intuitively appealing, research into teamworking in complex settings has long\nshown that the knowledge within the project team is usually insufficient for it to\naccomplish its tasks. Allen\u2019s (1984) studies of research and development project teams\nshows that consulting with organisational colleagues that are not assigned to the team\n14\ncomprises a significant amount of engineers\u2019 time. This is particularly so with high-\nperforming teams, and much less with low-performers. Allen concludes that technical\nsupport is needed beyond that available within the groups, and that supporting external\ncontacts should occur on a continuing basis or else serious problems will accumulate. The\nresearch shows that consulting colleagues outside of the team as a practice is used more\nfor problem definition and validation of this definition, rather than idea generation, which\nis a function performed largely within the team. Furthermore higher-performing\nengineers consult to about the same extent with colleagues outside, as well as inside their\nfunctional discipline.\nMore recent research has elaborated on Allen\u2019s original study. The degree of intimacy\nbetween team members and their external contacts has been the subject of work inspired\nby social network theory. This suggests that weak ties between organisational sub-units\n(Granovetter, 1973) are most efficient for a project team\u2019s search needs; transferring\nuseful, nonredundant knowledge across teams. This transferred knowledge speeds up\nproject activities, however there is a slowing effect where complex knowledge is\ntransferred (Hansen, 1999). Where complex knowledge needs to be transferred, strong\nties are required. However, these strong ties may preclude or limit searches for useful\nknowledge beyond existing contacts.\nFor problem-solving activities Allen suggests that intra-teamworking is less important to\nperformance than the communication contacts outside the R&D project team:\n15\nDespite the hopes of brainstorming enthusiasts and other proponents of group\napproaches to problem solving, the level of interaction within the project groups\nshows no relation to problem solving performance\u2026Moreover, it appears that\ninteraction outside the project is most important. On complex projects, the inner team\ncannot sustain itself and work effectively without constantly importing new\ninformation from the outside world. (Allen, 1984: 122-123)\nThis would seem to suggest that it is not so much the knowledge of the team members\nimmediately available that forms the advantage of project teams, but rather the access to\nthe external communities permitted by having those team members as gatekeepers to that\noutside knowledge. This brings us to the literature on cross-functional teams.\nCross-Functional Teamworking\nSeveral authors refer to the need for co-ordination and integration of the various\nspecialist disciplines and functions within an organisation (c.f. Grant, 1996a, 2001;\nPavitt, 1990, 1997; Dyerson & Mueller, 1999). Many working definitions of\n\u201cteamworking\u201d encompass team-to-team co-ordination and integration (Tranfield et al.,\n1998; Hoegl et al. 2000). In particular, cross-functional workflow and knowledge flow is\nargued to give individuals a sense of the \u201cbigger picture\u201d while ideally, management\nsimply co-ordinates (Webb & Cleary, 1994). The task of designing the integration across\nteams Grant (2001) suggests, is the primary role of management. The necessary\nintegration of specialised knowledge within teams can only be managed locally through\nmechanisms like routines. \u201cCross-functional\u201d teamworking has emerged as an important\n16\nimperative for organisations, and the subject of considerable management research and\nliterature.\nEmpirical research suggests that most New Product Development (NPD) activity uses the\ncross-functional form (Griffin, 1997). Gobeli & Larson (1987) present data for a sample\nof 1634 project managers in NPD, construction and new services and processes where\nless than 50% of managers used a pure functional structure, while 85% used some form\nof cross-functional matrix structure. As regards performance, Holland et al.\u2019s (2000)\nreview shows that inter-functional communication and transparency was correlated or\nassociated with successful NPD projects.\nCross-functionality is only one type of diversity that is said to be benefit teamworking\noutcomes, alongside age, gender, ethnicity, personal background etc. Roberts (1987)\nasserts that diversity of technical background, age and values appears to heighten project\nteam performance, as well as maintaining tension and challenge in the team. Too much\ncomfort and familiarity reduces productivity and tends against the refreshment of\ntechnical knowledge through external contacts. Leonard & Sensiper (1998) argue that\nalthough diversity entails the management of divergent viewpoints, this \u201ccreative\nabrasion\u201d can generate discussion and thought resulting in new ideas. Contrary to OB\ntextbook theory which stresses the advantages of similarity in achieving group\ncohesiveness, Leonard & Sensiper suggest \u201c\u2026intellectually heterogeneous groups are\nmore innovative than homogeneous ones.\u201d (1998: 118).\n17\nHowever, research on diverse teams also shows that group members do tend to have\nlower group cohesiveness and job satisfaction, higher turnover and stress (Keller, 2001).\nBy contrast to traditional functional silos, in terms of knowledge management there is a\nproblem to co-ordinate a diverse set of areas of expertise (Denison et al., 1996). While\nvarious authors argue that for systemic tasks like NPD, Cross-Functional Teams (CFTs)\nare more effective, Roberts (1987) and Allen (1984) claim functional organisations show\nbest technical performance. This is contested by Gobeli & Larson\u2019s (1987) study which\nshows that project managers generally felt that dedicated Cross-Functional project teams\nand project matrix type structures were judged most effective on criteria of technical\nperformance, costs and schedule. Those configurations tending more towards functional\norganisation were approaching a consideration of ineffective. It should be borne in mind,\nhowever that this is attitudinal data from project managers and such attitudes are perhaps\nto be expected.\nRoberts (1987) warns of the erosion of technical skills if a cross-functional project team\nis maintained over time. Engineers are removed from the disciplinary structure of their\nfunctions, and while matrix organisation is a noble ideal, usually one interest dominates.\nThere is often tension and conflict. Members of cross-functional teams, which are often\ntemporary, working groups, often act as champions of their respective functions (Denison\net al., 1996). Donnellon (1993) refers to team members withholding their functional\nknowledge from the CFT as a means of defending functional territory. As a practical\nsolution Donnellon suggests shifting the role of the functional manager away from\ncontrolling the resources that are \u201cmade available\u201d to CFTs, in favour of a \u201csupplier\u201d\nrole; teams themselves should be responsible for delivery. This generally supports Gobeli\n18\n& Larson\u2019s position above that recommends the balance of responsibility in favour of\nproject team managers.\nTeamworking, Identity and Communities of Practice\nThese tensions could simply be interpreted as the group-serving bias observed in\nbehavioural decision-making research, which is shown to have an even greater effect than\nself-serving biases (Taylor & Doria, 1981). However, individual and group identity is\nanother notion fraught with problems and factorial issues. Social identification theory\nsuggests that the immediate group is often more salient for the individual, than an\nabstract, secondary organisation, as the immediate group is where interpersonal proximity\nand task interdependence is greatest (Ashforth & Mael, 1989). The immediate group can\nbe a functional discipline or project team, but typically individuals have multiple,\nconflicting identities in the organisation. These are usually unresolved and are managed\nseparately; \u201ccompartmentalised\u201d, sometimes giving rise to hypocrisy and \u201cselective\nforgetting\u201d (Ashforth & Mael, 1989: 35).\nThese issues have long been debated in the field of ethnomethodology; the study of\nsense-making methods in everyday life. Sharrock (1974) refers to the problematic\nrelationship between the individual and the collectivity, and the corpus of knowledge that\nis attributed to the collectivity. He observes that the identification of the individual with\nthe collective corpus is presumptuous. Housley (2000) analyses team contexts through\nverbal communication and questions the relationship between team members and\n19\npurported external bodies of knowledge. Two views of team context are presented: one\nwhere context is imposed through stable, culturally defined, tacit influences, where team\nmembers merely act as filters for distinct corpuses of knowledge in their teams, and a\nsecond view where context is locally achieved and situated through interactions within\nthe group. Housley studies \u201cmultidisciplinary\u201d teams in health and social services, and\nchallenges the orthodoxy that members of these teams bring a \u2018specialist knowledge\u2019\nfiltering into the decision-making process, such that all opinions are canvassed and a kind\nof consensus is achieved. His enthnomethodological approach views context as locally\nachieved by the team, rather than an assemblage (albeit with some added value) of\nindividuals, each connecting to a distinct exogenous collectivity. These are teams that\ncontrary to those functionally-serving examples identified by Denison and Donellon,\nhave \u201cgone native\u201d.\nHousley notes Sharrock\u2019s point that the relationship between individuals and an ascribed\ncorpus of knowledge is problematic, and in the context of teams is based in\n\u201ccommonsensical\u201d sense-making. It is common sense that, for example, electrical\nengineers draw on a corpus of knowledge referred to as electrical engineering, rather than\nmechanical engineering, or Asian embroidery. However, individuals may not subscribe to\nthe corpus with which they are identified. The key point here is that the monolithic view\nof functions or disciplines can be a caricature. Knowledge is a situated phenomenon in\ncross-functional teams, rather than detached or transcendental. Professional\nfunctions\/disciplines are often invoked in teamworking dialogues to legitimate positions\nor claims. For Housley these are not so much the display of identity with the function, but\ntactics to win influence and credibility in the team context.\n20\nContext, in this view, is not so much imposed by the external functions of the collected\nteam members, as negotiated and achieved through the members\u2019 interactions in the team\nsetting. The ethnomethodology view has a similar emphasis to the cognitive perspective\nof collective mind, where the immediate workgroup encompasses an autonomy and set of\ninternal dynamics. Work on individual and group productivity bears this out, Roberts\n(1987) observes that in the innovation literature the nature of the immediate work group\nin terms of composition and supervision matter greatly to productivity among technical\nprofessionals, in addition to exogenous factors like the individuals\u2019 job maturity. In short,\nthe dynamics of team members\u2019 identification with bodies of knowledge will depend on\nthe context, but that context, in Houseley\u2019s terms, is partly imposed by the external\nfunctions and partly determined\/achieved by the team itself.\nThis somewhat dated debate becomes relevant again with the current interest in\n\u201ccommunities of practice\u201d, as described by Lave & Wenger (1991) and Brown and\nDuguid (1991) \u2013 \u201cThese groups of interdependent participants provide the work context\nwithin which members construct both shared identities and the social context that helps\nthose identities to be shared.\u201d (Brown & Duguid, 2001: 202). These communities\nnaturally emerge around local work practice and so tend to reinforce \u201cbalkanisation\u201d\naround functions or occupation, but also extend to wider, dispersed networks of similar\npractitioners (van Maanen & Barley, 1984; Constant, 1987). Academic communities\ntypify the dynamics of a collectivity sharing identity, know-how and ways of working\nindependently of local contact, but similar communities emerge within professions, and\nacross corporate domains where practices are shared.\n21\nBrown & Duguid (2001) argue that practice creates epistemic differences within the firm,\nand so balkanisation of the communities. The firm however is in a privileged position\ncompared to the market, because it is better able to co-ordinate dynamically the\nknowledge produced by the communities of practice, in spite of the differences. Problems\noccur as knowledge \u201csticks\u201d within the divisions of the firm, particularly where the firm\nis organised around the division of labour. Equally, knowledge may \u201cleak\u201d out from the\ndivisions as well as the organisation. The knowledge bases of the firm are not limited by\nits boundaries, given the type of co-ordination that allows contact and flow between\ninternal and external members of communities of practice. Brown & Duguid\u2019s solution is\n\u201cintercommunal negotiation\u201d of differently practising individuals, challenging and\nstretching each other\u2019s assumptions about ways of working. As argued above, cross-\nfunctional teamworking is an organisational setting that promotes this kind of\nintercommunal negotiation.\nThe true value of cross-functional teamworking is the channels it opens to the bodies of\nknowledge that are exogenous to the team. This is confirmed by recent research by Keller\n(2001) that shows that there is an important mediating variable between cross-functional\ndiversity in a team and performance. The mediating variable is external communications,\nwhich effects improvement to technical quality, schedule and budget performance, but\nreduces group cohesiveness. This recent research further weakens the causality of the OB\ntextbook theory that cohesiveness in a team improves its performance. In fact, it appears\nquite irrelevant to performance. If any cohesiveness is important it is that between an\nindividual and her community of practice. Functional diversity allows a project team to\n22\nbetter tap into sources of external knowledge resources in order to cross-fertilise ideas,\nsolve problems and integrate project-pieces so as to effect better performance. Keller\nshows that the primary effect of diversity is indirect, through external communications.\nBy itself functional diversity had a strong, negative direct effect on budget performance,\nand no direct effect on schedules.\nKahn (1996) argues that temporary cross-functional teams are something of a red\nherring, and that interdepartmental integration should be a higher priority for\norganisational initiatives than trying to make these onerous teams work. Interaction is\noften mistaken for integration, while they are in fact, distinct phenomena. Kahn suggests\nremedies to functional insularity such as joint lunches to co-location, or rotating the\nfunctional managers, but not necessarily more formal interaction through cross-functional\nteamworking.\nKahn\u2019s view on interaction and integration is supported by Pinto & Pinto (1990) who\nshow that greater cross-functional co-operation was associated with project teams that\nrelied to a greater extent on informal means of communication, accidental meetings by\nthe coffee machine, telephone calls etc. Colocation was argued to promote this type of\ncontact and communication. This is tested by Kahn & McDonough (1997) without\nfinding a direct relationship between colocation and performance. The influence of new\nInformation and Communications Technologies on teamworking as well as the increasing\nglobalisation of corporate activity reopens the research issues around workspace and\ninteraction conducted by Allen (1984).\n23\nFrom this discussion several threads of research point to a view that cross-functional\nteamworking may be regarded as an organisational means of promoting the exchange of\nknowledge and practice across disciplines and communities. The literature suggests that\nthis benefits creative activities such as new product development but there are associated\npenalties with regard to technical performance and professional career development. In a\nsense the working of the teams is secondary in that their key function is in integration.\nThe group that the individual identifies with is unpredictable. However, teamworking is a\nmeans to an organisational end, in terms of knowledge management, by providing a\nsetting for intercommunal negotiation across communities. Teamworking is something\nmore than an operational solution, for example to cope with modularity or complexity.\nConclusions\nThe article has drawn from various branches of literature, the objective was to draw\ntogether work that gives insight into teamworking and knowledge management. This has\nmeant the research and theory are dispersed across several fields, and the resulting\ndiscussion has been occasionally conflicting and unresolved. The final section presents\nthree declarative propositions that might summarise the work that has been reviewed. The\npropositions represent the opinion of this author, having considered the foregoing\nliterature, rather than being representative of the field. Nor are they intended or expressed\nas \u201ctestable\u201d hypotheses.\n(1) Team cohesion or a strong \u201cgroupness\u201d is not a prerequisite for successful task\nperformance.\n24\nThe traditional Organisational Behaviour textbook theory of teamworking tends to\noveremphasise the interpersonal dynamics or \u201cstrong groupness\u201d factor in teamworking.\nA broader survey of literature suggests interpersonal dynamics and attraction to\ncolleagues is not a prerequisite for successful teamworking. Collective mind can rapidly\noccur in teams that have not developed groupish behaviour, but strong groups often suffer\nfrom stagnation and a narrowing activity system. Commitment to task appears to be a\nmore powerful predictor of performance, rather than cohesiveness.\nEmpirical work suggests task performance and effective knowledge management are\noften in conflict with behavioural prescriptions of cohesiveness. The OB textbook theory\ntypically emphasises homogeneity as a basis for interpersonal attraction in teams, but the\nliterature on cross-functional teamworking, and innovation suggests diversity among\nteam members improves creativity and project performance, in spite of lower cohesion.\nResearch has also shown that teams with greater cohesion tend to be more insular, closed\nto the knowledge and influence outside of the team.\nThe point here is not that cohesion is necessarily negative, or undesirable, but it is not as\nimportant to effective teamworking as depicted in the organisational behaviour textbook\ntheory. It should also be noted that the OB textbook theory is not representative of\nresearch done under the rubric of the OB discipline, which often displays a sophisticated\nunderstanding of knowledge and teamworking. We might expect this more recent work to\nimpact on the textbooks in time.\n25\n(2) The content of individual knowledge bases when combined in a team, effects the\nefficiency of teamworking.\nResearch on the content of individual team members\u2019 knowledge shows why a team is\nnot always \u201cgreater than the sum of its parts\u201d. Where team members\u2019 knowledge is\nsimilar and overlaps, teamworking is more efficient, as tacit understanding is shared and\nthere is less need for explanation and demonstration (Hutchins, 1993; 1995). Where the\nindividuals\u2019 knowledge bases are quite different, teamworking is slowed and\ncomplicated. This is why cross-functional teams are typically difficult to make work,\ncreating a trade-off with the benefits that diversity brings.\nIn complex task environments where specialist knowledge needs to be integrated, team\nstructures based around modular product architecture have proved successful. The\nadvantage is that team size is restricted to a small enough scale that the combination of\nspecialisms is made more manageable. The organisational problem is then to co-ordinate\nthe interfaces between the teams. Research shows that for complex tasks frequent and\nsubstantive consultation with the external organisation and communities of practice is\nassociated with higher performance. This leads to the third proposition:\n(3) The team\u2019s external links are at least as important as its internal dynamics for\nknowledge integration.\nNumerous studies have shown that inter-teamworking is as, if not more important than\nintra-teamworking. In complex contemporary industries such as software, \u201cteamwork\u201d is\n26\nan ambiguous term which in real terms expresses the need for regular group reviewing of\nindividuals work and consulting among colleagues (Failla, 1996). In such task\nenvironments, the internal behavioural dynamics of teamworking and teambuilding\nstressed by the OB textbook theory are somewhat off-target.\nThe benefits of cross-functional teams, for example, derive from their privileged\ncommunication channels to external communities of practice; the gatekeeping function.\nKnowledge tends to be transferred more easily where the source and the recipient are\nsimilar, as is typical in communities of practice, and tends to stick across the boundaries\nof these communities. Cross-functional teams are a useful organisational setting for the\n\u201cintercommunal negotiation\u201d (Brown & Duguid, 2001) to break down the boundaries.\nAlthough the members of such teams will still share more with their own community,\nthey may also \u201cgo native\u201d. As shown by the field of ethnomethodology, the immediate\nwork group is not a negligible influence on identification. As regards identity, while\nBrown & Duguid are entirely right to emphasise that organisations are not monolithic,\nneither are communities of practice, as one may infer from some of their work. As\nasserted by the social identification theory cited above, there are many competing\nimpulses for an individual working in a complex organisation.\nThe picture that emerges is one of teamworking as organisational design (Galbraith,\n1994; Mohrman et al., 1995; Tranfield et al., 2000) to promote knowledge sharing, as\nwell as efficiency in operations. Traditional foci on internal behavioural dynamics and\ngroup identity are supplanted in favour of the content and interactions of differentiated\n27\nknowledge bases. Teamworking is increasingly recognised as a systems solution\n(Ciborra, 1993, 1996; Senge, 1990), involving not only the level of the team, but the\nindividual, the functional department, the organisation, the community of practice, and\nthe necessary interactions between these levels.\nFuture work on teamworking and knowledge management is sure to continue assessing\nthe impact of new information and communications technologies, new organisational\nforms, and globalisation. These are all rich research themes not covered by this review\n(c.f.
