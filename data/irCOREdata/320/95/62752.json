Ungava Peninsula is a vast \n(aproximately 350 000 km2) and sparsley populated sector of north-eastern Canada. The northern \ncoast of the peninsula is located along the Hudson Strait, which links the waters of the Canadian \nArctic and Subarctic to the North Atlantic Ocean via the Labrador Sea. These areas play a key \nrole in the formation of deep water and thermohaline circulation affecting climatic variability on \nlocal and global scales (Dickson 1997). However, the absence of long-term observational data in \nthe area makes it difficult to assess the local extent of historical climatic variability and change, \nalthough recent analyses of paleolimological records suggest that certain areas of Ungava \nPeninsula and Labrador have not undergone environmental variations of similar extent to those \nrecently observed in the western Subarctic and High Arctic (Pienitz et al. 2004; Smol et al. 2005). \nAttention needs to be focused on these areas to gain better insight into the pre-instrumental record \nof moisture transport to this region in order to better understand the potential impacts that \nchanges in hydroclimatology could have on locally derived runoff. \n \nIn recent years, the use of stable isotope proxies to characterize past climate and hydrological \nprocesses has gained noticeable popularity in Quaternary paleoclimatological and \npaleolimnological research (summarized in Leng 2005). Isotope paleolimnology is based on the \npremise that the isotope composition of lake waters is related to local climate and that this signal \nis transferred to components that grow in the lake and form the lake sediment as they are \n 5\ndeposited. However, the \u03b418O and \u03b4D of lake waters do not necessarily reflect that of annual \nprecipitation, this depends on several physical properties such as residence time of water and lake \nto catchment ratio (Leng et al. 2005). Thus, in order to conduct more reliable paleoclimatological \nstudies based on stable isotope composition of lacustrine material (eg., endogenic carbonates and \ncarbonate\/silicate fossils), local present-day hydrology and climatological conditions first need to \nbe defined and lakes identified which have the potential to accurately record different aspects of \nclimatic and environmental variations (Leng and Anderson 2003; Leng and Marshall 2004).  \n \nThere have been no investigations or systematic calibration of isotope variation in the modern \nenvironment in the Ungava region. There is sparse climatic data, and environmental isotope data \nare completely absent for most of northern Qu\u00e9bec (see for example IAEA and CNIP data; \nhttp:\/\/www.science.uwaterloo.ca\/~twdedwar\/cnip\/cniphome.html). Despite the development of \nmodels capable of estimating the modern relationships between \u03b4 18O in precipitation and latitude \nand altitude (Bowen and Wilkinson 2002; Bowen and Revenaugh 2003; Bowen et al. 2005), the \nneed for baseline measurements of climate data is important if we are to monitor climate change. \nPermanent climate monitoring facilities in northern Ungava have recently been established \n(between 1989 and 1992) by the Meteorological Service of Canada (Environment Canada \nNational Climate Archive; http:\/\/www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca\/). However, to go further \nback in time, we must rely on inferences from various environmental data in order to understand \nthe long-term trends in climate, especially over the last centuries to millennia. This paper \nprovides a summary of the climatic data available for the coastal Ungava region for the last 30 \nyears, as well as the first water isotope data from modern northern Ungava precipitation, lake \nwaters and groundwaters contained in permafrost. The results presented here set the framework \nfor future isotope-based paleolimnological and paleoclimatological investigations in this region, \n 6\nwhich could yield important insights into past climatic properties and dynamics that are necessary \nfor the prediction of future environmental and climatic conditions in Ungava. \n \nStudy region  \nGeology, topography & vegetation \n \nThe water data presented in this study were measured from water samples collected in the \nvicinity of the northern villages of Salluit, Kangiqsujuaq and Quaqtaq (Fig. 1), in the northern \ncoastal Ungava Peninsula region (between 61\u00b0-62\u00b0 N and 69\u00b0-75\u00b0 W). The coastal fringe of  \nnorthern Ungava forms part of the Churchill geological province. The bedrock consists of \ngranitic gneisses of Archean and Proterozoic age, overlain with thin Quaternary deposits. The \nnorthern sector of the Ungava Peninsula is a plateau (Saglouc Plateau) crossed by a mountainous \ncorridor (Povungnituk Hills). The average altitude of the plateau is between 300 and 600 m a.s.l., \nand the highest elevations are found inland between Salluit and Kangiqsujuaq. In this sector, the \ncoast is indented by fjords, but becomes lower eastward (toward Quaqtaq).  \n \nThe region is covered by sparse herbaceous tundra vegetation, although protected depressions \nsuch as riparian vallies may support dense growths of Salix shrubs (Maycock and Matthews \n1966). Grasses, mosses and lichens are dominant in the northernmost sectors (Salluit, \nKangiqsujuaq), whereas sedge-moss meadows can be common closer to Ungava Bay (Quaqtaq). \nHowever, vast areas of the region remain barren of vegetation, especially at higher altitudes.  \n \n 7\nClimate \n \nThe climate of northern Ungava is cold and relatively dry (Table 1, Fig. 2) and is influenced by \nthe extent and duration of sea-ice cover over the surrounding water bodies. In Hudson Strait, sea-\nice break-up usually occurs in early July and freeze-up occurs from west to east during late \nOctober to early December. On land, snowpacks and lake ice usually disappear at the end of June \nfor a period of 3-4 months, although snow remains present throughout the summer in sheltered, \nshaded areas.  \n \nEstimates of annual precipitations for Ungava Peninsula as a whole (roughly 55\u00b0- 62\u00b0 N, 69\u00b0- \n77\u00b0 W) vary between 350 and 550 mm annually, with the three warmest months (July, August, \nSeptember) receiving between 150 and 200 mm \n(http:\/\/www.menv.gouv.qc.ca\/biodiversite\/aires_protegees\/provinces\/partie4j.htm). Temperature \nand precipitation data were collected sporadically in Quaqtaq between 1972 and 1988 by the \nCanadian Weather Office (CWO). More recently, the CWO has been recording temperatures and \nwind directions regularly at Salluit and Kangiqsujuaq airports (since 1992) and at Quaqtaq airport \n(since 1989). However, there are no precipitation records for Salluit and Kangiqsujuaq. The \nnearest stations where precipitation is currently measured are Kimmirut, Cape Dorset and Iqaluit, \naccross Hudson Strait on southern Baffin Island, where between 1971 and 2000 the mean annual \ntotal ranged from 340 to 400 mm, and more than half of annual precipitation fell as snow (88%, \n64% and 52%, respectively). Most rainfall occurred during summer (between July and \nSeptember), with a mean of 117 mm in Kimmirut (representing 76% of total annual rainfall), 137 \nmm in Cape Dorset (95% of total annual rainfall) and 180 mm in Iqaluit (91% of total annual \nrainfall) for those three months. The available data from Quaqtaq indicate that between 1972 and \n 8\n1988, mean total annual precipitation was around 380 mm, and slightly less than half (44%) fell \nas snow. During July-September, a mean of 166 mm of rainfall was recorded, representing 78% \nof the annual total. The precipitation regime in Quaqtaq is therefore comparable, albeit with \nsomewhat wetter summers, to that of the three previously mentioned stations on Baffin Island; \nconsequently, we consider these values to be representative of the Hudson Strait region as a \nwhole.  \n \nBetween 1972-2005 in Quaqtaq, there was a statistically significant (r2 = 0.4405; P value = \n0.0008) increase in mean annual temperature (1\u00b0C), with the most notable monthly changes \noccurring in April, July and October. In fact, it seems all seasons have been getting warmer in \nQuaqtaq. However, in Salluit and Kangiqsujuaq, between 1992-2005, no significant variations in \nannual temperature means were recorded. But, despite the relatively short span of these two \nrecords, slight increases in autumnal seasonal means have been observed (for the months of \nOctober and November in Kangiqsujuaq and for November in Salluit).  \n \nThe dominant air masses in the region shift seasonally, although Arctic air masses are \npredominant throughout the year. Summer air masses are important in that they bring most of the \nrainfall to the region. On Baffin Island during most of the year, winds blow from the west and \nnorthwest, except during the summer, when they are easterly in Cape Dorset (July-August) and \nsouth-easterly in Iqaluit (June-September) (Fig. 1) (wind directions not available for Kimmirut). \nIn northern Ungava, the situation is slightly different. In Salluit, the dominant wind direction \nduring the summer months (June, July and August) is from the northeast, whereas winds blow \npredominantly from the southwest (i.e., Hudson Bay and the interior) during the rest of the year. \nIn Kangiqsujuaq, winds shift from a northerly direction between April and July to a westerly \n 9\ndirection during most of the remainder of the year. This translates into a dominant influence of \nmarine air masses in the summer (bringing precipitation) and a continental influence during the \nrest of the year. Finally, in Quaqtaq, the direction of the wind remains relatively constant and \nblows predominantly from the northwest, i.e., from Hudson Strait, throughout the year (see Fig. 1 \nfor dominant summer wind directions). Based on the thermal amplitudes, Quaqtaq seems to have \na more oceanic climate compared to the other two localities (Table 1), although all three localities \nreceive northerly derived air masses from the Arctic.  \n \nStudy sites \n \nThere are many thousands of lakes and ponds across northern Ungava but their limnology has \nnever been studied in detail. The lakes in this study (presented in Table 2) are clear, oligotrophic \nand dilute (< 90 \u00b5S cm-1) systems with circumneutral to slightly acidic pH. Measurements of \ntemperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen throughout the water columns indicate that they \nare well mixed, year-round (continuous cold polymictic). Their depths and sizes vary, but they \nare all open through-flow lakes and receive the majority of their input through summer \nprecipitation and spring surface runoff from melting snow in their catchments. Although the \nstudy region is located in a zone of continuous and widespread permafrost (Taylor and Judge \n1979), lack of information on the local configuration of beneath-lake permafrost and the possible \nbut undetected presence of taliks (unfrozen zones that occur beneath lakes) prevent us from \nmaking any assumption on the effect of groundwater seepage on the water balance of these lakes.  \n \nMethods  \n 10\n \nWater samples were collected from 8 lakes between June 2002 and September 2004. The \nfrequency of the sampling was dictated by logistical constraints. Two of the lakes were sampled \non multiple occasions during the summer of 2002, but the majority were sampled only once (4 \nlakes) or twice (2 lakes), with the result that these samples are both spatially and temporally \nspecific. Water samples for isotope analysis were taken either from the center of the lake (from a \nsmall boat or through ice-cover) or, if this was not possible, from the littoral zone. Precipitation \nwas collected five times in Salluit during the summer of 2002. Rainwater was allowed to \naccumulate in a pan until enough was gathered to fill a 30 ml polyethylene bottle. This usually \ntook between 6 and 24 hours. Groundwater was extracted from 2 permafrost samples taken near \nSalluit. The 2 groundcore sections were allowed to melt in sealed plastic bags and were \ncentrifuged to separate the water from the sediments. Waters were collected for 18O\/16O and D\/H \nanalysis in leak-tight polyethylene bottles, additionally sealed with PVC tape. The waters were \nanalysed at NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory (UK) using the equilibration method for \noxygen (Epstein and Mayeda 1953), and Zn-reduction method for hydrogen (Coleman et al. \n1982; Heaton and Chenery 1990). Isotopic ratios (18O\/16O and 2H\/1H) are expressed in delta units, \n\u03b418O and \u03b4D (\u2030, parts per mille), and defined in relation to the international standard, V-SMOW \n(Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). Analytical precision is typically \u00b1 0.05 \u2030 for \u03b418O and \n\u00b1 2.0 \u2030 for \u03b4D. \n \nResults and discussion  \nRainfall and permafrost \n \n 11\nThe \u03b418O and \u03b4D values for rainfall collected at Salluit (Table 3 and Fig. 3) during June and July \n2002 fall well below the global meteoric water line (GMWL) and are characteristically scattered, \nas \u03b4 values in precipitation tend to vary according to temperature, rainout history and the source \nof moisture (Gat 1996; Darling et al. 2005). The average \u03b418O value of the 2002 summer \nprecipitation samples from Salluit is \u221215.37\u2030, much higher than the value of \u221218.14\u2030 predicted \nby the Online Isotopes in Precipitation Calculator (OIPC; www.waterisotopes.org). The closest \npermanent station where isotopes in precipitation are measured is Goose Bay, in central Labrador \n(53\u00b027\u2019 N 60\u00b043\u2019 W), where the mean annual temperature between 1961 and 1990 was 0.0\u00b0C. In \nthe 1960s (1961-1969), the mean annual \u03b418O value measured at Goose Bay was \u221215.5\u2030. The \nvalue shifted to \u221214.6\u2030 between 1997 and 2003 (CNIP Website; \nhttp:\/\/www.science.uwaterloo.ca\/~twdedwar\/cnip\/cniphome.html). \n \nTwo groundwater samples taken from permafrost from Salluit have similar \u03b418O values despite \noriginating from different depths (48-57 cm; \u03b418O \u221215.81\u2030, in the active layer and 122-145 cm; \n\u03b418O \u221216.92\u2030, in the permanently frozen layer) and from different boreholes. They have similar \n\u03b418O values to some of  the lakes in the region, lying on or slightly offset from the GMWL (Fig. \n3), and similar to the mean \u03b418O value of 2002 summer precipitation (\u221215.37\u2030). The values \nprobably represent a mean of many years of accumulation. \n \nAt high latitudes, on a large geographic scale, there is generally a strong linear correlation (with a \nslope of  0.69\u2030\/\u00b0C for \u03b418O) between mean annual surface air temperature and mean annual \u03b418O \nin precipitation (Dansgaard 1964; Rozanski et al. 1992). The isotopic signal of nordic lake waters \nis therefore considered a good indicator of mean summer temperatures if a) the signal concords \n 12\nwith the meteoric water line and there is no evaporative effect, and b) the lake is replenished by \nprecipitation. The empirical isotope-temperature relation in precipitation for sites having a mean \nannual temperature (MAT) < 15\u00b0C has been described by Jouzel et al. (1994) as the following: \n \n\u03b418O(p) = 0.64MAT \u2013 12.8     [1] \n \nThe MAT in Salluit in 2002 (\u22128.8 \u00b0C), and the mean \u03b418O measured in local summer precipitation \n(\u221215.37\u2030) is 3.03\u2030 higher than the value (\u221218.43\u2030) predicted by Jouzel\u2019s equation, which is \nmuch closer to the aforementioned predicted value (\u221218.14\u2030) by the Online Isotopes in \nPrecipitation Calculator (OIPC; www.waterisotopes.org). These predicted values are closer to the \nmore isotopically depleted lake waters of Tasikutaaq and Qaanganiituuq (2002 mean \u221216.42\u2030) \nthan to the one recorded in lac de l\u2019A\u00e9roport (2002 mean \u221214.52\u2030). One reason for this \ndiscrepancy might be that equation 1 demands the use of mean annual \u03b418O of precipitation, \nwhereas we only have measurements of summer rainfall.  \n \nLake waters \n \nThe \u03b418O and \u03b4D of any given lake water will depend on the hydrologic balance between inputs \n(direct precipitation, surface runoff, inflows, groundwater seepage) and outputs (evaporation, \noutflows, groundwater loss). The isotopic signals of the lake waters in this study are either similar \nto or fall below the GMWL (Fig. 3). The isotope signal of the groundwater and of the lakes \nsuggest that evaporation has little effect on these components during summer. A tentative local \nmeteoric water line is thus defined for the region, but more data is needed to confirm its trend.   \n \n 13\nThe lowest lake water \u03b418O and \u03b4D as well as the groundwater samples from Salluit lie very close \nto the GMWL. These lake samples come from Tasikutaaq and Qaanganiittuq, two lakes near \nSalluit (Table 2). The water samples from these two lakes have a deuterium excess (d-excess = \n\u03b42H \u2212 8 \u03b418O) similar to that of the groundwater samples (+7 to +10.5\u2030), whereas lac de \nl\u2019A\u00e9roport, the other lake sampled near Salluit, has d-excess values more similar to that of local \nprecipitation (0 to + 5.5\u2030; the d-excess of measured local precipitation ranging from \u20130.6 to \n+4.6\u2030). The d-excess parameter gives an indication of the \u201chumidity\u201d of local precipitation in \nrelation to the GMWL, which has a d-excess of +10\u2030. Many factors influence differences in d-\nexcess, such as varying temperature, relative humidity and wind speed at the sea surface. \nGenerally, local precipitation has a seasonal cycle which is marked by lower d-excess during the \nsummer and higher d-excess in the winter (Edwards et al. 2004). The low d-excess values \nobserved for the summer 2002 precipitation in Salluit are typical of precipitation derived from \noceanic sources in the 60\u00b0N \u00b110\u00b0 latitude band, in general (Bowen and Revenaugh 2003). It is \nworth noting here that, despite the wide scatter in the absolute \u03b418O and \u03b4D values of our local \nsummer precipitation, the d-excess values are remarkably constant (Table 3), suggesting a \nconsistent source region effect and minimal sampling error. This leads us to considering that  \nd-excess could potentially be a powerful tool for partitioning the relative contribution of moisture \nsources to the water budget of this area. If the right proxies can be applied (measuring both \u03b418O \nand \u03b4D), past changes in precipitation seasonality or source could even be distinguished using the \nd-excess parameter. \n \nOne possible explanation for the discrepancy in the d-excess of the three lakes in Salluit might be \nthat the smaller basin of lac de l\u2019A\u00e9roport is more responsive to summer precipitation and\/or has \n 14\na shorter residence time than the larger and deeper basins of Tasikutaaq and Qaanganiittuq, which \nhave a greater storage capacity and tend to buffer seasonal variations and retain an isotopic \nsignature closer to that of annual precipitation. Another factor which might contribute to the \ndifferent isotopic signature of lac de l\u2019A\u00e9roport compared to the other Salluit lakes might be \nsnowmelt bypassing, whereby the topography of the drainage basin and\/or fluctuating water \nlevels can lead to flushing of snowmelt under or around ice cover with minimal mixing, resulting \nin under-representation of isotopically-depleted winter precipitation in a lake\u2019s budget (Edwards \nand McAndrews 1989). However, this possibility was not verified in the field. \n \nTo the best of our knowledge, there are only three other lake waters for which \u03b418O has been \nmeasured in northern Ungava. The lakes in question are located inland about 100 km west of \nKangiqsujuaq, within the recently created Pingualuit Provincial Park, and were sampled in \nsummer 1988 by Ouellet et al. (1989). Lac Rouxell (61\u00b013\u201939\u201dN, 73\u00b047\u201941\u201dW) and lac \nLaflamme (61\u00b020\u201927\u201dN, 73\u00b042\u201948\u201dW) are large lakes (surface area \u00b1 20-30 km2, max. depth \n10 m), whereas Pingualuk (61\u00b016\u201937\u201dN, 73\u00b039\u201938\u201dW) is a crater lake (surface area 6.68 km2, \nmax. depth 265 m). The \u03b418O values measured for these lakes (analytical precision \u00b10.1\u2030; \nreproducibility \u00b10.2\u2030) are significantly lower than for our study lakes; \u221219.1\u2030 (Rouxell; \nsurface), \u221218.7\u2030 (Laflamme; surface) and \u221217.2\u2030 (Pingualuk; mean of entire water column, \nwhich is well-mixed during the ice-free season despite its great depth). Snow from the catchment \nof Pingualuk collected during that summer was also analysed and yielded a \u03b418O value of \n\u221219.3\u2030. Unfortunately, \u03b4D was never measured, rainfall was not collected and there are no data \non the provenance of the dominant air masses for the Pingualuit area. The Pingualuk crater lake \nhas a small lake surface to basin ratio (0.7) and is replenished only by meltwater and rainwater \n 15\n(Ouellet et al. 1989); it also has a very long residence time (about 330 years), which means that \nthe isotopic signal incorporates rainfall over a long period. Interestingly, the isotopic signature of \nthe crater lake water (\u221217.2\u2030) is equivalent to a mixture of summer rainfall which we measured \nat Salluit in 2002 (\u221215.37\u2030) and that of the snow from the catchment of Pingualuk (\u221219.3\u2030). \nThis lake water data suggests that there has been no long-term shift in the average isotopic values \nof precipitation for the region during the last three centuries. \n \nThe lake waters from the three localities studied here have distinct isotopic signatures (Fig. 4). \nThe three lakes from the Salluit area, the north-westernmost site, have the lowest \u03b418O values \n(mean = \u221215.68\u2030, which is very close to the mean value for precipitation in this locality: \n\u221215.37\u2030), followed by lakes near Kangiqsujuaq (mean = \u221214.09\u2030) and finally Quaqtaq (mean = \n\u221212.91\u2030), which is the south-easternmost site. The values overlap somewhat, but there appears \nto be a geographical gradient. It is tempting to suggest that the east-west lowering of \u03b418O in \ncoastal summer rainfall is due to temperature as mean annual temperature for Salluit is lower than \nfor Kangiqsujuaq and Quaqtaq (although the maximum temperature difference of 1.4\u00b0C equates \nto \u223c1\u2030 using the aforementioned relation of 0.69\u2030\/\u00b0C).  \n \nInterseasonal lake waters \n \nOur data indicate some variation in the signal of the lake waters (+0.5 to +1.1\u2030) between spring \nand early fall (Table 3). Increasing \u03b418O between spring and fall is expected because the lakes are \nreplenished by rainfall during the summer months (the effect of the isotopically depleted winter \nprecipitation, both snow falling onto the frozen lake and melt water during the spring thaw, is \n 16\ngradually countered by the input of higher \u03b418O summer precipitation). In the two Quaqtaq lakes \nwhich were only sampled in spring under ice cover (Lakes Sunirlait and X), the \u03b418O values were \nlower than those measured in Tasing, which was sampled both times in late summer. The same is \ntrue of their d-excess values. \n \n \nConclusion  \n \nModern instrumental data help characterise the climate (temperature, precipitation, dominant air \nmasses) of northern Ungava Peninsula and show that it has remained stable between 1992 and \n2004 in the vicinity of the villages of Salluit and Kangiqsujuaq. In Quaqtaq, there has been a \nslight tendency towards warmer means throughout the year, between 1972 and 2004, but the \nrecord is of insufficient length to assess the historical representativeness of these recent \nobservations. \n \nThe isotope composition of  \u03b418O and \u03b4D measured in precipitation and surface waters from \nnorthern Ungava fall on or slightly below the GMWL, but define a preliminary local meteoric \nwater line for the region. There is a longitudinal gradient from west to east in the lake waters, i.e.,  \n\u03b418O and \u03b4D are lower in Salluit than in Kangiqsujuaq and Quaqtaq. The available data, although \nfragmental, suggest that evaporation is negligible in some of these lakes and the isotope signal \nprobably mostly reflects annual temperature. Our rudimentary data also suggest that some lake \nwaters vary seasonally, possibly due to flushing of the lakes by the spring runoff of meltwater \nfrom ice and snow that accumulated during the preceding winter, before being replenished by \n 17\nsummer rainfall. Isotope composition of winter precipitation and seasonal balance of recharge to \nthe lakes would be needed to confirm this with more certainty. Additionnally, the possible \npresence of the \u201ccatchment effect\u201d should be assessed in each lake basin before attempting \npaleoisotopic analysis. This process introduces waters into the lake with an isotopic composition \nwhich varies from precipitations due to the nature of the terrain and its effect on runoff to the \nlake. The \u201ccatchment effect\u201d can vary in time with vegetation cover and other ecological changes \nand can introduce into the paleoisotopic archive a signal equivalent in size to a 2-3\u00b0C change in \nmean temperature (Gat and Lister 1995). Nevertheless, the lakes sampled in this study offer the \npotential for different types of paleoenvironmental information (annual flushing and longer term \nmeans) if their archives are to be investigated. In the Salluit area, for example, the waters of lac \nde l\u2019A\u00e9roport reflect the isotope signature of summer precipitation, whereas larger Tasikutaaq \nand Qaanganiittuq have values closer to the annual mean. The observations presented in this \nstudy, including the potential of d-excess as a powerful tool for partitioning the relative \ncontribution of moisture sources to the water budget of this area if the right proxies can be \ndesignated, could eventually have important implications for deciphering past changes in \nprecipitation seasonality or source in the region.  \n \nThis study shows that lakes in the northern Ungava region contain water that records aspects of \nclimate. If the \u03b418O and \u03b4D signals of the lake waters are retained in lacustrine sedimentary \ncomponents, then these could become a valuable archive of northeastern Canadian climate, a \nregion where little paleoclimatic information is thus far available.  \n \n \n 18\nAcknowledgements \n \nThis research in northern Ungava received funding from a National Sciences and Engineering \nResearch Council of Canada grant awarded to R.Pienitz, Alliances de recherche universit\u00e9s-\ncommunaut\u00e9s, Canadian Northern Scientific Training Program and Fondation de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 \nLaval, as well as logistical support from the Centre d\u2019\u00e9tudes nordiques.
