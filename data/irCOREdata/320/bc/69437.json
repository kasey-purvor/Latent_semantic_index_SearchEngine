INTRODUCTION \nULTISTAGE depressed collectors are widely used in M microwave linear beam tubes [l], high power gyrotron \ndevices [2], and particle accelerators [3] to recover the energy \nof the spent charged particle beam and thus enhance the overall \nefficiency of the device. The use of depressed collectors also \nhas the additional advantages of reducing the collector cooling \nrequirements in high power devices and the X-rays generated \nin high voltage devices. In some systems in which the overall \npower consumption is a primary concern, such as satellite \ncommunications, mobile transmitters, large TV transmitters, \nand high energy accelerators, a 100 percent recovery of the \nspent beam energy would be highly desirable. Significant \nadvances have therefore been made in the design of depressed \ncollectors to approach this goal. Detailed reviews of the \ndevelopment of depressed collectors for microwave tubes have \nbeen made by Kosmahl [ l ]  and Kumar and Carter [4]. \nManuscript received December 7, 1994. The review of this paper was \narranged by Associate Editor J. A. Dayton Jr. This work was performed at \nLancaster University under an ESTEC contract. \nL.

He \nis now deceased. \nIEEE Log Number 9412984. \nAmong all the types of collector geometry used so far the \naxi-symmetric geometries developed by Kosmahl and his co- \nworkers at NASA [5], [6] and Neugebauer and Mihran at \nthe General Electric Company [7] have been most widely \ninvestigated and used in the industry. This is because they \nare simple to construct and do not require a magnetic field. \nThese collectors have achieved efficiencies in excess of 85% \nin travelling-wave tubes (TWT\u2019 s) with basic efficiencies of \nabout 17% [6]. This performance was achieved as a result of \nmajor and consistent efforts devoted to collector development \nand the optimization of their design using 2.5-D computer \nsimulations [6]. Backstreaming of electrons into the circuit \nregion is inherent in the design of depressed collectors [ 5 ] .  \nWhile this may be tolerated to some extent in ECM tubes it is \nhighly undesirable in radar and communication tubes because \nit degrades the tube performance and may cause oscillations. \nSome other types of collectors including the hyperbolic electric \nfield (HEF) collector with off-axis electron beam [SI, the tilted \nelectric field (TEF) collector [9], and crossed-field collectors \n[lo], [ 1 11 have demonstrated reasonably high effficiencies \nand promise of reduced backstreaming. Further work on the \noptimization of these designs has been hindered hitherto by the \nlack of analytical techniques or computer codes suitable for \nmodeling them. A fully three-dimensional electrostatic code \nwith the facility of electron trajectory tracing in the pres- \nence of an external magnetic field is required for simulating \nasymmetric and crossed-field collectors. A facility for electron \ntrajectory sorting and collzctor efficiency calculations is also \nnecessary for a collector simulation code. Secondary electrons \nplay a significant role in determining the performance of a \ncollector so provision for calculation of their trajectories is \nalso desirable. \nTo satisfy this requirement, a 3-D package for simulating \ndepressed collectors has been developed at Lancaster Univer- \nsity under an ESTEC project [12], [13]. Results of simple \nbenchmark test runs of the package have demonstrated its \naccuracy for depressed collector problems. The usefulness \nof the package for asymmetric and crossed-field collectors \nhas been shown by the results of simulations of Hechtel\u2019s \nhyperbolic electric field (HEF) collector [8] and of a tilted \nelectric field (TEF) collector with a transverse magnetic field \nfor which some experimental data was available. \n11. DEVELOPMENT OF THE 3-D PACKAGE LKOBRA \nThe collector simulation package (LKOBRA) is based upon \nthe 3-D code KOBRA3 which was originally written for the \n0018-9383\/95$04.00 0 1995 IEEE \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 9, 2008 at 05:29 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\n1664 \nsimulation of ion sources [14]. LKOBRA incorporates the \nIBM-PC version, KOBRA3-INP1, unchanged [ 151. Upgrades \nof KOBRA3-INP can thus be readily substituted for the \nversion (1.13) which was used for the simulations reported \nhere. Some improvements in KOBRA3-INP were made by \nINP to make it more suitable for collector simulation on the \nbasis of feedback from the work carried out at Lancaster. \nLKOBRA also contains pre- and post-processors which \nhave been developed to facilitate interactive creation of input \ndata files, collector analysis, and calculation of secondary \nelectron effects. LKOBRA runs interactively on an IBM-PC \nor compatible system with at least 640 kbytes of memory. The \ndisk storage requirement of the package is about 1.5 Mbytes \nand a typical problem may require about 5 Mbytes of disk \nspace. \nFor large problems the extended-DOS, WINDOWS, or \nmainframe versions of KOBRA3 can be used. The output \ngraphics of the mainframe version are inferior to those of the \nPC version but LKOBRA can be used on a PC for pre- and \npost-processing the data of problems which are run using the \nmainframe version. The main segments of the package are \ndescribed below. \nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 42, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 1995 \nA. Input Integace \nThe LKOBRA input interface facilitates the interactive \ncreation of the input data file for a given problem in the \nformat required by KOBRA3 [15]. Its main features are a \nset of pre-defined shapes for generating plane-by-plane cross- \nsectional data for asymmetric geometries and a beam model \nfor generating the starting conditions of the trajectories at \nthe collector entrance. It also has conversion of units from \nmillimeters to meters and degrees to radians built into it. The \nbasic shapes which have been pre-defined in this program are \nshown in Fig. 1. It is possible to combine these shapes to \ndefine more complex shapes and to cut holes through some of \nthem. The beam model in the interface is useful for generating \nsensible initial conditions for the trajectories when 3-D spent \nbeam data is not available. However, if 3-D spent-beam data is \navailable from the output of a large-signal analysis program or \nfrom experimental measurements, then the starting conditions \nof the trajectories can be added to the input data file by the \nuser. For instance the spent- beam output of the 2.5 D large- \nsignal program [ 161 can be directly appended to the input data \nfile. A beam of arbitrary cross-section can also be simulated \nby choosing appropriate starting positions of the beamlets. \nThe beam model requires as basic data of the electron beam \nits radius, current, and voltage, an estimated kinetic energy \ndistribution, and the maximum angular spread of the beam. \nIt assumes the initial beam cross section to be circular and \ndivides it into a number of rings. Each ring is then divided \ninto a number of sectors such that the areas of all the sectors \nin the beam cross section are equal. The current density in \nthe beam is assumed to be uniform and thus all the sectors \nrepresent equal amounts of current. The given spent-beam \n'KOBRA3-INP is distributed by INP, Junkemstrasse 99, 62 Wiesbaden, \nGermany. Copies of LKOBRA can be obtained (subject to ESTEC approval) \nfrom Dr. R. G.  Carter at Lancaster University. \n(e) \nFig. 1 .  (a)-(e) Basic shapes defined in the input interface. \nenergy distribution is mapped in a pseudo-random manner \nonto the sectors so that the number of sectors to which a \nparticular energy is assigned is proportional to the percentage \nof the total current in this energy range. A specified number \nof trajectories can be started from the centre of each sector \nwith their initial angles distributed randomly within a given \nrange -0 to +B. This randomization avoids, to some extent, \na preferential distribution of energy or starting angles. \nB. The Mesh Generator \nThe KOBRA3-INP mesh generator discretises the three- \ndimensional box containing the problem geometry into cubical \nelements. In the DOS version, the mesh array size is limited \nto 16000 mesh points but in the extended DOS version up \nto 120000 mesh points can be used on a machine with 5 Mb \nof random access memory. Arbitrary electrode shapes can be \nsimulated but the feature size is limited by the mesh spacing \nused. The coordinates of the comers of the polygonal cross \nsection of the electrodes in each mesh plane must be provided \nfor arbitrary shapes. Simple rectangular or circular geometries \ncan be input using geometrical data. Local mesh refinement is \npossible in all three coordinate directions in any desired mesh \ninterval. Neumann (open circuit) boundries are allowed only \non the sides of the problem box. \nC. The Poisson Solver \nThe KOBRA3-INP Poisson solver uses a seven-point finite \ndifference (FD) method for the solution of Poisson's equation \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

In this methoc. the potential at any mesh \nnode is given, in terms of the potentials at the six neighboring \nnodes in the coordinate directions, by the expression \nhl4l+h2 2 h343+h444 h5 5+h646 ( h l h d h l + L  + h3h4(h3+h4) + h5&h5+hd - E) \n(k+&+&) \n$0 = \n(1) \nwhere hi is the distance of the i-th node from the central \nnode and $i is the potential at the i-th node (see Fig. 2). \nThus all the six nodes are allowed to have different distances \nfrom the central node. Where an electrode intersects the \nmesh line joining the i-th node to the central node $i is \ntaken to be the electrode potential and hi the distance of the \npoint of intersection from the central node. The accuracy of \nthis method is of the order of (hm,)', where h,, is the \nwidth of the coarsest mesh. The space charge term on the \nright hand side is determined by tracing the charged-particle \ntrajectories. The system of FD-equations for all the internal \nnodes of the problem is solved using an iterative procedure. \nThe successive over-relaxation (SOR) method is used to speed \nup the convergence of the solution. \nD. The Trajectory Solver \nThe KOBRA3-INP trajectory solver solves the relativistic \nLorentz force equation for charged particles in electric and \nmagnetic fields \nOnly a constant magnetic field in any or all of the coordinate \ndirections can be applied in the normal DOS version of \nKOBRA3-INP because of the limited memory available. This \nlimitation is removed in the extended DOS version. All \ntrajectories are assumed to carry equal amounts of current. \nThe current density distribution is therefore represented by the \ndistribution of the trajectories. Trajectories of multiple species \nof particles can be calculated simultaneously. The trajectory \nequations are solved using a method similar to the Runge- \nKutta method with step size control. The maximum number \nof trajectories is 30000 but this may be limited by the disk \nspace available for storing the trajectory data. \nThe starting velocity of a trajectory can be specified by all \nthe velocity components in d s e c  or any one component by \nthe energy in keV and the other two components by the angle \nwith the axis or by the emittance of the beam. The position, \nvelocity components and total energy of each particle at each \npoint of its trajectory are stored in a data file. \nE. Post-Processor for Collector Analysis \nThe LKOBRA post-processor sorts out the trajectories land- \ning on different electrodes and the backstreaming trajecto- \nries. It also calculates the backstreaming power, the power \ndissipated and recovered at each collector stage and the \ncollector efficiency. KOBRA3 stores the Hamiltonian (total \nenergy) at each trajectory point in the trajectory data file. The \nHamiltonian and the velocity components of the trajectory at \nits starting- and end-points are used to determine the input \npower carried by the trajectory, and the power dissipated by \nit on the electrode at its end-point. The total power entering \nthe collector (Pent) is calculated from \n(3) \nwhere V,  is the voltage corresponding to the initial kinetic \nenergy of the i-th trajectory, Ii the current associated with the \ni-th trajectory, and Nt the total number of trajectories. The \npower Pj recovered at the j-th collector stage is determined \nby \nPj = -V,ItMj (4) \nwhere Vj is the potential of the j-th electrode with respect \nto ground and Mj is the number of trajectories arriving at \nthis electrode. The total power recovered (Prec) is calculated \nby summing the powers recovered (Pj )  at all the collector \nstages. The collector efficiency 77, is found by using the simple \nrelation \n( 5 )  \nBackstreaming trajectories are identified by the positions of \ntheir end-points which lie at or before the entrance plane of \nthe collector. \n~c = (Prec\/Pent) x 100%. \nF. Post-Processor for Secondary Electron Effects \nThe LKOBRA post-processor facilitates the automatic cal- \nculation of secondary electron trajectories. It determines the \nstarting conditions of a secondary trajectory for each pri- \nmary trajectory and writes it to the input data file.

The starting points of the secondary \ntrajectories are located at the end-points of the primary tra- \njectories. This is not likely to introduce any significant error \nsince these end-points are generally close to the electrode \nsurfaces. A total kinetic energy of 50 eV is assigned to \neach slow secondary electron which is generally considered \nas the maximum energy of true secondary electrons. The \ninitial direction of the secondaries is assumed to be normal \nto the electrode surface since slow electrons are preferentially \nemitted in that direction. The normal to the electrode surface \nis determined using the coordinates of the trajectory end- \npoint and the mesh information. In the present version it \nis not possible to include the space-charge of the secon- \ndaries. This is because the secondary electron trajectories \nare calculated separately from the primary trajectories and \nKOBRA3 deletes the space-charge of the previous iteration \non restarting the trajectory calculations. It is also not possible \nto calculate the secondary trajectories simultaneously with \nthe primaries because KOBRA3 does not allow trajectories \nto have different currents. The influence of the space-charge \nof the primaries will, however, be present in the potential \ndistribution which is used to determine the electric field \nfor the secondary electron trajectory calculations. Further \nimprovements in KOBRA3 will be carried out to overcome \nthese problems. \nG. Post-Processor for Resetting Primary Trajectories \nAn option has been provided in LKOBRA for restoring \nall the data related to the primary trajectories after the sec- \nondary electron effects processor has been run. However, the \nsecondary electron data is lost on running this processor. \nH. Program Output \nKOBRA3-INP provides printed and graphical output in \nforms which are useful for collector simulations. The 3-D \ndisplay of electrode geometry, mesh and trajectories indi- \nvidually or together can be viewed from any angle. The \ngeometry and mesh can be displayed in any particular mesh \nplane or between any two mesh planes. The trajectories \ncan be sorted according to ranges of serial number, initial \nenergy, charge or mass of the particles. 3-D plots of potential \nsurfaces in any mesh plane are available. A 2-D plot option \nprovides plots of geometry, equipotentials and electric field \ncomponents in any mesh plane. It is also possible to display \ncurves of potential, total energy and kinetic energy components \n(individual or combined) versus trajectory path length. Sorting \nof trajectories can also be done in these plots in the same \nway as in the 3-D plots. Such plots provide very useful \ninsights into the behavior of trajectories in different energy \nranges. \nThe various KOBRA3 program units interact with other \nunits through disk files. This modular structure made it possi- \nble for us to develop LKOBRA as an extension of KOBRA3 \nand made it convenient to control the flow of the program \ninteractively. The package can also be run in batch mode \nfor a given number of potential and trajectory calculation \ncycles. \n111. VALIDATION OF THE PACKAGE \nTo validate the package and test its performance for 3-D \ndepressed collector simulation, some simple benchmark tests \nwere performed. The benchmark tests were a beam spread test, \nto check the accuracy of the space-charge field calculation, and \nan electron spectrometer test to check the trajectory calculation \nin given electro- and magneto-static fields. The results of the \nbenchmark tests are discussed in the following sections. \nA. Beam Spread Test \nThe expansion of a cylindrical electron beam in a field- \nfree region under the influence of space-charge forces is given \nby the universal beam spread curve [17]. According to this \na uniform electron beam of radius TO doubles its radius in a \ndistance \nL = 0.01207 r~ \/ (pperv) ' .~  \nwhere pperv is the microperveance of the beam. The beam \nspread test was performed for a beam 1 mm in radius carrying \na current of 100 mA at 1 kV (3.1623 pperv). To simulate \nthis problem 100 trajectories representing an electron beam \nwith the above parameters were started at one end of a box \nwith a square cross section. The trajectories were distributed \nuniformly over the beam cross section. The axis of the beam \ncoincided with the axis of the box. The potential on all sides \nof the box was held constant at 1 kV. The distance at which \nthe beam radius became twice its initial value was found to \nbe 6.67 mm which agrees well with the theoretical value of \n6.78 mm given by (6). \nB. Electron Spectrometer Test \nThe accuracy of the trajectory calculation in itself and \nin accounting for the bending effect of a magnetic field \non an electron can be checked by a very simple electron \nspectrometer test. In this test a number of trajectories with \nenergies in the range of 0.6-1.3 kV in steps of 0.1 kV \nwere started from a single point in the x-direction in a \n14.5 cm cube having a constant potential throughout and a \nmagnetic field of 9.43 Gauss in the z-direction. The agree- \nment between the theoretical and computed values of the \nz-position of the end-points of the trajectories was found to \nbe better than 1%. \nIv .  SIMULATION OF AN ASYMMETRIC \nHYPERBOLIC ELECTRIC FIELD (HEF) COLLECTOR \nA four-stage HEF collector, similar to one described by \nHechtel [8], was simulated in order to study its general \nbehavior and to demonstrate the capabilities of LKOBRA. In \nHechtel's collector the electrodes were hyperbolic in shape and \nthe electron beam was launched off-axis. For the simulation \nwe approximated the hyperbolic shapes of the electrodes by \ncones with a total collector length of 31.8 mm. The beam \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 9, 2008 at 05:29 from IEEE Xplore.

The potentials of the \nfour collector stages were 24.54 kV (body), 12.54 kV, 6.54 \nkV, and 0.54 kV. The spent beam energy distribution used \nis shown in Fig. 3 (curve b)  and the beam diameter was 1.4 \nmm. The starting conditions of the trajectories representing \nthe electron beam were generated using the beam model \ndescribed in Section 11-A. The beam cross section was divided \ninto 41 segments of equal area. Five trajectories were started \nfrom the center of each segment with their incident angles \nrandomly distributed in the range -10\" to +lo\". The total \nnumber of trajectories was 205, and these were distributed \namong various energy ranges by the program (Table I). A \nself-consistent solution of the problem was obtained in five \niterations. A tolerance of 0.1% in collector efficiency was used \nas a criterion for self-consistency. The average run-time of \nthis problem on an IBM compatible microcomputer (33 MHz, \n80386 processor with 80387 Maths co-processor) running \nunder MS-DOS was 105 sec. for the potential solution (50 \niterations) and 27 min. for the trajectory calculation for each \niteration. The total disk memory requirement for this problem \nwas 10 h4bytes. The complete details of the simulation are \ngiven in [13] and [18]. \nPlots of the electron trajectories in the HEF collector are \nshown in Fig. 4. Note that this figure and all subsequent \nfigures were produced using the output facilities of KOBRA3- \nINP. An altemative representation of trajectories is available \nin KOBRA3-INP in which any component of the energy, \nthe total energy, or the potential along the trajectory can \nbe plotted as a function of its path length. Fig. 5 shows \nthe axial and transverse kinetic energy components and the \nFig. 4. \nHEF collector. \n3-D representation of the electrode geometry and trajectories in the \npotential energy versus the path length of the trajectories. \nIn the plot of axial energy versus path length (Fig. 5(a)) the \ncontinuously falling curves correspond to trajectories which hit \nthe electrodes directly. The curves having well defined minima \ncorrespond to those trajectories which turn back after attaining \nzero axial velocity and then possibly land on an electrode. The \nheight of a curve after the minimum indicates the axial kinetic \nenergy which will be dissipated by this trajectory. This height \nshould be minimized for all trajectories to achieve the greatest \ncollector efficiency. The spread in the initial kinetic energy of \nthe trajectories belonging to a particular kinetic energy class \noccurs because part of the total kinetic energy is associated \nwith transverse velocity components. Two trajectories around \n23 kV have very short path lengths because they are being \nintercepted by the body electrode. \nThe maximum transverse kinetic energy in Fig. 5(b) is 2 \nkV which is about 8% of the highest beam energy. Fig. 5(c) \nis a plot of the potential versus the path length of the \ntrajectories. The end-points of the curves in this figure indicate \napproximately the potentials of the electrodes on which the \nelectrons are collected. The curves in this plot achieving \nthe highest (body) potential indicate the electrons reaching \nthe body electrode or backstreaming. As in this case no \nbackstreaming trajectories are visible in the trajectory plots, \ntheFe curves show the trajectories reaching the body electrode \nonly. In this plot also as in the plot of axial kinetic energy \n(Fig. 5a), the electrons hitting the electrodes directly and those \nlanding after undergoing a reflection can be identified. \nTable II shows the results of the computer analysis of the \nHEF collector. These results demonstrate the capabilities of \nLKOBRA for the simulation of depressed collectors of this \ntype. \nA. Secondary Electron Effects \nTo study the effects of secondary electron emission in \nthe HEF collector the slow secondary electron trajectories \nwere also simulated. A 3-D plot of the secondary electron \ntrajectories in this collector is shown in Fig. 6. This shows \nthe trajectories originating from the lower potential electrodes \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

SJMULAnON OF A TILTED \nELECTFUC FIELD (TEF) COLLECTOR \nA three-stage TEF-collector of simple geometry for which \nsome experimental data was available was simulated [ 181. The \nelectric field configuration in this collector was similar to that \nof Okoshi\u2019s soft-landing TEF collector [9] but in this case the \nmagnetic field was transverse instead of being parallel to the \naxis. The tilted electric field sorts the electrons according to \ntheir energy and the transverse magnetic field (prominent in \nthe third stage) is expected to reduce the backstreaming. This \ncollector was used in a helix travelling-wave tube with a beam \nvoltage of 4.8 kV and a net collector current of 53.2 mA. The \ncollector stage voltages were 4.8 kV (body), 2.4 kV, and 1.2 \nkV. The experimentally measured spent-beam kinetic energy \ndistribution is given in Table 111. The beam radius was 0.63 \nmm. \nTo simulate the problem on a PC, coarse mesh widths of \n1.9 mm in the %-direction and 0.9 mm in both the y- and \nz-directions were used. Local mesh refinement was used in \nthe regions where the inter-electrode gap or feature sizes were \nsmall. Fig. 7 shows the geometry of the 3-stage TEF collector \nwith the finite-difference mesh superimposed showing the \nlocal mesh refinement in the 2-y plane. A total of 14440 \nmesh points was used to define the problem. To model the \nbeam the circular beam cross section was divided into six \nrings which together contained 61 segments of equal area. \nThree trajectories were started from each segment with their \ninitial angles randomly distributed in the range of -2\u201d to \n+2O. This smaller range of angles was chosen arbitrarily \nconsidering the fact that the perveance of the beam is very \nlow (-0.16 pPerv). The 183 trajectories used were assigned \nkinetic energies such that the distribution approximated that \ngiven in Table 111. The simulation of this collector was carried \nout both without and with a uniform transverse magnetic field \nin the y-direction. A self-consistent solution of the problem \nwas obtained in six iterations. The average run time of the \nproblem on the micro-computer specified in Section IV was 73 \nsec. for the potential solution (50 iterations) and 45 minutes for \nthe trajectory solution in each iteration. The total disk memory \nrequirement of the problem was about 10 Mbytes. The results \nof simulation of the TEF collector without a magnetic field \nwill be described first followed by the effects of the magnetic \nfield. \nA series of interesting equipotential plots in four successive \nplanes at 0.8 mm intervals in the vicinity of the second \ninter-electrode gap is shown in Fig. 8.

Some backstreaming trajectories are visible on \nthe left side of the figure. Many of the trajectories also appear \nto be reflected after penetrating some distance into the third \nstage. The series of trajectory plots in Fig. 11 shows groups \nof trajectories belonging to each of the first four classes of \nenergy in the electron beam.

The shapes of the inner surfaces of the first \npair of electrodes were found to have a marked influence on \nthe trajectories of these electrons in some other simulations. \nElectrons with energy 0.65 VO (3120 eV) are collected at this \nstage after being reflected by the retarding field at the second \ngap (Fig. 1 l(b)). Fig. 1 l(c) is interesting because it shows \nthat most of the trajectories having a kinetic energy equal to \n0.75 VO (3600 V) are not getting collected at the third stage \nwhich is at a potential of 3600 V below that of the first stage \n(body). This is because a part of their total kinetic energy \nhas been converted into transverse energy and their remaining \naxial energy is not sufficient to take them to the walls of \nthe third stage. Increasing the voltage of the third stage to \nabout 3400 V would, perhaps, have made it possible for this \ngroup of electrons to land on it so increasing the collector \nefficiency. The faster electrons above 0.85 VO reach the third \nstage directly with a deflection in the vertical (y) direction \ndepending upon their starting positions and energies. \nA comparison between the experimental results and the \ncomputer analysis without a transverse magnetic field is given \nin Table IV. Good agreement is seen in the collector efficien- \ncies with a maximum difference in efficiencies of 0.6%. The \ndistributions of currents among the collector stages however \ndiffer by as much as 32%. Similar differences between exper- \nimental and computed results have been described by other \nauthors [6]. The simulation also predicts a small amount of \ncurrent reaching the body electrode and primary backstream- \ning current but no experimental data is available for these \nquantities. \nA. Effect of a Magnetic Field \nA dipole magnet of 0.2 A . m2 magnetic moment oriented \nalong the y-axis and located toward the end of the third \nstage was applied to the experimental TEF collector (Fig. 7). \nThis type of magnetic field could not be simulated by the \nDOS version of KOBRA3 but it would be possible using the \nextended DOS version which is undergoing evaluation tests. \nIn order to see the influence of a transverse magnetic field on \nthe trajectories in the TEF collector a uniform magnetic field \nof 8.0 Gauss was applied in the y-direction. This is roughly \nequal to the field produced on the axis of a magnetic dipole \nhaving a moment of 0.2 A.m2 at a distance of 20 mm from its \nTABLE N \nCOMPARISON OF COMPUTED RESULTS (WITHOUT AND WITH MAGNETIC FIELD) \nAND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS (WITH MAGNETIC FIELD) FOR THE TEF COLLECTOR \nQWtitY I \nPower entenng collector \nBackstreaming cunmt \nPower recovered m stage 1 \nPower recovered nt mge 2 \nPower recovered n stage 3 \nPower Luipand n stage 1 \nPower dissipated at stage 2 \nPower Lmpated n stage 3 \nBackstreaming power \nTotal power recovered \nColleeror &icimcy \n-\nComputed \n(B = 0) \n1 9 0 0 W  \n0 3  mA \n366  mA \nI45  mA \n1 7 m A  \n0 0  w \n8 7 9  w \n523  W \n0 9 W  \n2 9 7  w \n1 2 9 W  \n6 3 W  \n1402 W \n73 8% \nD W I  \ncenter. The complete problem was run again until convergence. \nThe primary trajectories showed little influence of this field by \nbending of the trajectories in the y-z plane. The effect of the \nmagnetic field on the secondary trajectories was significant. \nFig. 12 shows the secondary electron trajectories in the TEF \ncollector without and with a transverse magnetic field. A large \nnumber of secondary trajectories are backstreaming in the \ncase without the magnetic field (Fig. 12(a)). In the case with \nthe magnetic field the secondary electron trajectories starting \nfrom the backwall of the last stage and from other electrodes \nwere bent in such a fashion that they were collected at the \nelectrode of their origin and backstreaming of secondaries \nwas completely eliminated (Fig. 12b). There was also some \nredistribution of current among the electrodes. The collector \nstage currents were: 6.0, 37.2 and 13.7 mA for stages 1 to 3, \nrespectively. The agreement of this current distribution with \nthe experimental distribution appears to be better than that \nof the current distribution without the magnetic field (Table \nIV). The collector efficiency was reduced to 72.9% which \nis only 0.6% less than the experimental value. Thus we can \nconclude that the prediction of the collector performance has \nbeen improved by taking the magnetic field into consideration. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

CONCLUSION \nThe development of a 3-D package named LKOBRA for \nsimulation of asymmetric and crossed-field multistage de- \npressed collectors for microwave linear-beam tubes has been \ndescribed. This package is based upon the 3-D code KOBRA3 \nwhich was originally developed for simulation of ion sources \nand subsequently improved for simulation of depressed collec- \ntors. The package has been validated using analytical results \nfor electron beam spreading under space-charge forces and \nbeam bending in a transverse magnetic field. Two different \ntypes of collector: Hechtel\u2019s hyperbolic electric field (HEF) \ncollector with an off-axis beam and a tilted electric field (TEF) \ncollector with a transverse magnetic field have been simulated \nusing LKOBRA to demonstrate its capabilities. Good agree- \nment has been found between the collector efficiency predicted \nby LKOBRA and the experimental value for the TEF collector. \nAlternative representations of electron trajectories in terms of \nplots of the kinetic energy components or of the potential \nenergy versus the path lengths, and sorting of trajectories \naccording to their energy ranges have been shown to be a \nbetter way of understanding the behavior of the collector than \nthe conventional method of trajectory plotting. The package \nis expected to serve as a useful design tool for novel types of \ndepressed collectors. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors are grateful to the Head of the Engineering \nDepartment, Lancaster University for providing the facilities \nfor carrying out this work.
