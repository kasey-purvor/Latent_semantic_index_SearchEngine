ISBN: 0-7494-1768-4, 136 (+\nvii) pages, paperback. \u00a314.99.\nAlthough the range of research undertaken by\nuniversities and colleges covers a very wide\nspectrum, each of the books in this Kogan Page\nseries is narrowly focused on a particular form\nof research, that of small-scale 'insider\nresearch'. This is defined as research into\nteaching and learning which is undertaken by\ntutors with the specific aim of improving their\nteaching practice. The series is intended to be\nquick and easy to read, to provide starting\npoints for research into teaching practice, and\nto give pointers to ways in which outcomes may\nbe recorded and published. It aims to deal with\ncontemporary issues affecting teachers in\ncolleges and universities, and to include a range\nof research methods with suggestions for how\nthese might be used or adapted in particular\ncircumstances. Each book in the series shares a\nversion of the opening and concluding\nparagraphs. The opening paragraph introduces\na concept of insider research based on the\nnotion of the reflective practitioner of\neducation: this model takes the view that\nteachers should play an active role in\nconstructing and reconstructing knowledge with\nthe aim of improving teaching. 'Research' is\nrelated mainly to the rating system defined by\nthe Higher Education Funding Council for\nEngland (HEFCE).\nThe text is careful not to offer a blueprint for\nresearch activity. This would be unlikely to be\nof practical value, given the very wide range of\n\/contexts and activities in which readers would\n\/ be engaged. It seeks instead to provide pointers\n\/ to how to begin reflective research activity, and\n' to the limitations of small-scale research, and\nstresses the need for objectivity. The kinds of\ngroup which might be suited to study, and their\nparticular perspectives, are listed, as are the\ndifferences between the traditions of qualitative\nand quantitative research methodologies in\neducation (there is also a useful appendix which\nintroduces the use of IT in qualitative analysis).\nThere is a synopsis of methods for data\ncollection and analysis.\nChapters 2 and 3 deal mainly with the changing\nrole of the lecturer, and highlight some\ncontemporary directions for research into\nteaching. This again is mostly concerned with\nthe situation in the UK, and highlights policy\ninitiatives such as National Vocational\nQualifications (NVQs), the influence of\nteaching-quality assessments, and problems of\nsemesterization. The move towards a mass\neducation system is related to problems in\nteaching large groups. Aspects of research into\nstudent learning include strategies for learning\nand students' perceptions of learning and of\nassessment. The extent to which students are\nable to take charge of their own learning is\ncontrasted with views about the extent of\nteacher guidance. Open, resource-based, and\ndistance learning are detailed, and the relative\nadvantages and disadvantages are discussed.\nChapter 4 deals with approaches and issues\narising from vocationalization of the\ncurriculum, again specifically related to the UK.\nHowever, the rich literature on students'\nlearning styles and its relationship to styles of\n69\nReviews\nteaching and to personality is not indicated, and\nthe referencing might have been enhanced by\nthe addition of several key texts in this area. The\nuse of computer technology for the delivery of\neducational materials is discussed, though IT is\nassociated only with models of interaction\nclassified as 'surface' or 'deep', and little is said\nabout the evaluation of learning outcomes. The\nculture of educational organizations, as a focus\nfor research, is a useful contribution in Chapter\n5. An explanation of the various cultures,\nborrowed from Charles Handy's perspective on\ninstitutional cultures, is informative. Linked\nwith this is discussion of institutional change\nand the management of change.\nThe concluding chapter is a synopsis of the\nprocesses leading to getting research published.\nThis deals with the process from both the\nauthor's and publisher's points of view, and\noffers good advice on the negotiation of\ncontracts. Finally, there is an annotated list of\npublishers. For those new to publishing, this\nchapter provides an excellent overview.\nThe book is well referenced, and reading lists\nare helpfully annotated with comments on the\nscope and suitability of the texts chosen. Each\nchapter also suggests a number of focused\nresearch tasks: these are displayed as separate\ntables.\nThis is a small book of only six comparatively\nshort chapters. However, as an introduction to\nhelp tutors to begin researching into aspects of\ntheir own work, it is clearly written and\ninformative at an appropriate level. It provides\nsound advice, and good pointers to the kinds of\nresearch which might be undertaken by tutors,\nthough it does focus on the research-assessment\nculture which is current in the UK. It will\nperhaps be of particular value to those who are\nexpert in the practice of their subject but not\nnecessarily in its pedagogy, and who are\napproaching formal, publishable research for\nthe first time.\nDavid Durling, Edge Ltd, Hartlepool\nDesigning Electronic Performance Support Tools\n\u2014 Improving Workplace Performance with\nHypertext, Hypermedia and Multimedia by\nG. H. and E. F. Stevens, Englewood Cliffs, NJ:\nEducational Technology Publications, 1995.\nISBN: 0-87778-283-0. 265 pages, paperback.\n$39-95.\nElectronic performance-support systems (EPSSs)\nare becoming an important mechanism for\nproviding on-the-job, just-in-time training at\nappropriate points of need within both\nacademic and industrial\/commercial organiza-\ntions. They are also important as a support\nfacility within organizations which undergo\ndynamic change in order to meet the demands\nplaced upon them. As the benefits of this\napproach become more widely realized, there is\na growing demand for their use. Unfortunately,\nin the past there has been a distinct shortage of\nappropriate tools and methodologies to enable\nthe rapid creation and application of\nperformance-support techniques. This book is\ntherefore a welcome publication.\nThe book is organized into ten chapters, a\nglossary, a bibliography and a subject index.\nThe major topics covered include a discussion\nof human performance in relation to electronic\nperformance support; the important constituent\ntechnologies that make up an electronic\nperformance-support environment; the anatomy\nof an application; planning information\nstructures and file structures; navigation; end-\nuser interface design; the design and use of\nembedded tools; implementation techniques;\nhardware and software issues; and a series of\ncase studies that deal with performance support\nand organizational change.\nChapter 1 starts off with a discussion of a range\nof background considerations relating to the\nneed for and use of EPSS tools within\norganizations. An important aspect of this\nchapter is the mapping of generic performance-\nsupport tools onto organizational functions. In\nChapter 2 the authors provide a description of\nvarious approaches to the design and\ndevelopment of EPSS facilities. They suggest an\nobject-oriented approach involving rapid\nprototyping, and the chapter provides a useful\nchecklist for selecting a development tool based\non the characteristics of the application\ninvolved and the environment in which it exists.\nApplication characteristics are further discussed\nin Chapter 3, which goes into hypermedia and\nobject-orientation in greater depth, while\nChapter 4 deals with the essential planning\nissues that need to be considered as part of\nhypermedia design. These issues include\nanalysis of opportunities for performance\nsupport; planning how information in an\napplication should be organized and labelled;\nand selecting file structures which will be\neffective for the application.\n70\nALT-} Volume 4 Number 3\nChapter 5 considers the important topic of\nnavigation. It outlines some of the common\nnavigational problems associated with\napplications and design tools. Some of the\nchallenges that designers have to meet are\ndiscussed; they include end-user orientation;\nfocusing users' attention; and providing\ncontextual understanding of the information in\nan application. Tools available to manage these\nchallenges are described.\nChapter 6 deals with end-user interface design\nfor performance-support applications\nprimarily for screen displays. It provides a set of\nguidelines for creating a consistent and effective\nuser-interface. The authors also present a nine-\nstep systematic methodology for interface\ndesign, along with checklists for using this\napproach. Embedded tools to improve end-user\nproductivity and performance are important\naspects of all EPSS facilities. This issue is\ndiscussed in Chapter 7. Typical examples of\nsome of the types of tool considered include\nnote-taking utilities; calculation and analysis\ntools; and auditing tools that can be used to\ntrack users' navigation and use of facilities.\nPrevious chapters in the book have each\npresented essential design strategies for all\napplication areas. In Chapter 8 the authors\nelaborate on selected guidelines for specific\ntypes of application. The three broad types of\napplication considered are instructional, on-line\nreference and job task automation. The issues\nconsidered within the examples presented\ninclude optimizing navigational design;\nfeedback; information structuring; user access;\nidentifying what should be automated; and\nhelping clients to define and communicate their\nexpectations.\nChapter 9 deals with the hardware and software\ntools needed to create hypermedia and\nmultimedia applications in EPSS environments.\nWithin the context of selecting hardware and\nsoftware resources, the authors consider three\nmain perspectives: what is needed to create\napplications, what is required in order to run\napplications, and what is the best way to\ndisseminate them. The MPC (Multimedia PC)\nstandard is briefly discussed, and there are also\nsome useful sections on the design implications\nof using digital audio and video.\nThe final chapter is used to present three case\nstudies relating to EPSS and organizational\nchange. They are rooted in the areas of claims\nprocessing in a health\/medical insurance\ncompany; company reorganization to achieve\nan optimal information environment based on\nthe use of EPSS; and fleet management within a\nlarge automobile leasing company. These case\nstudies serve to illustrate the positive benefits of\nEPSS facilities, and the importance of\nunderstanding the interaction between EPSS\ntool design and organizational structure.\nNowadays, the use of EPSS facilities is starting\nto challenge conventional approaches to the use\nof computers in education and training. For\nthose wishing to get involved in this area, this\nbook contains some very useful tips and\ntechniques.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nEducational Telecommunications, 1996: Pro-\nceedings of Ed-Medial Ed-Telecom 96, edited by\nPatricia Carlson and Fillia Makedon,\nCharlottesville VA: Association for the\nAdvancement of Computing in Education\n(AACE), 1996. ISBN: 1-880094-22-3. 395 pages,\npaperback.\nIt would be impossible, even if the space\navailable here were much greater, properly to\ndescribe the contents of this weighty volume,\nthe proceedings of Ed-Telecom 96, an\ninternational conference focusing on educa-\ntional telecommunications, held in Boston\nMassachusetts in June this year. There are 58\nfull papers and 46 short papers, covering the\ncomplete range of telematics in education,\neverything from evaluating distance-learning\nprogrammes to creating a virtual campus. These\npapers were selected from over 300\npresentations at this leading conference.\nAs with all the proceedings I have ever come\nacross (and this, of course, is inevitable) there is\ngood and bad. In these proceedings, however,\nthere is very good and very bad. Many of the\nshort papers are simply too short to tell us\nanything except that someone is working in such\nand such an area (though this can be useful in\ncertain circumstances, I agree); others manage to\nput forward innovative ideas about which one\nwould have liked to hear much more. But the\nreal interest in this volume lies in the full papers\nwhich make up 337 of the 395 (large-size) pages.\nAnd here, the standard is even more variable. At\none extreme, there are some exceptionally badly\nwritten, badly constructed descriptive-pieces of\nthe type which now makes me tear my hair out.\nThey often open with something like: \"The use of\nthe microcomputer to provide an integrated\n71\nReviews\nlearning environment for teaching a variety of\ndisciplines has received much attention in recent\nyears.' They then continue on the lines of: \"We\ndid this, then we did that, and the students liked\nit [positive feedback is the correct expression],\nthough there were a few students who had some\nreservations (see Figure 29 for a graphical\nrepresentation).' At the other extreme, however,\nthis volume contains some excellent analyses\nwhich reveal the real problems of distance\neducation, and which suggest interesting\nsolutions, as well as identifying and warning\nagainst not so obvious traps into which the\nnovice distance teacher might fall.\nThe contents are not grouped by theme, and\nunfortunately there is no introduction to\nexplain the thinking behind the order in which\nthe papers appear (I could not work it out).\nThis is surprising because the editors mention in\ntheir short preface the 22 major areas\nsupposedly covered by the conference. But this\ncriticism is not very significant: a glance at the\nlist of titles (or at the list of authors at the back\nof the book, if one feels that is important) is all\none needs in order to find the material most\nappropriate to one's area of activity. And\nanyone working in educational telematics will,\nfor sure, find quite a lot of food for thought\nhere even if they almost choke on some of it. So,\nif you are working in this field, or even just\ninterested in it, I suggest you get an inter-library\nloan form as soon as possible.\nGabriel Jacobs, University of Wales Swansea\nThe Adventures of KC in London (five CD-\nROMs) by Adrian Brockett, Arabesque\nMultimedia, 9 Woodland Road, Darlington,\nCounty Durham DL3 7BJ. Tel. 01325 350700.\nOf all multimedia training applications,\nlanguage-teaching programs are conspicuously\nunsuccessful. This is usually for one of two\nreasons. Often, they are designed by\nprogrammers without too much input from\nteachers, with the result that, while the\nappearance is attractive with a variety of clever\nactivities, the pedagogical content is low. The\nalternative is that they are designed by teachers\nwith little experience of programming, and the\nresult is that however worthy the content, the\nprogramming is dull and fails to take advantage\nof the opportunities offered by multimedia\nformat. The Adventures ofKC in London is quite\nexceptional in that it appears to be designed by\na writer who is neither programmer nor teacher.\nAs a result, this program is unfriendly to use,\nand the language content (what little there is of\nit) lacks accuracy, purpose and direction.\nThe program is an EFL teaching application\ndesigned for use by native Arabic speakers who\nhave completed four or five years of language\ninstruction in schools. The material provided\nfor evaluation consisted of a CD-ROM with a.\ntutorial program and one out of five teaching\nprograms or 'adventures'. The tutorial program\nnot only explains the contents of the teaching\nprograms and how they work, but also sets the\n'scenario' which is that the crown jewels have\nbeen stolen from the Tower of London by\nthieves who are, for no obvious reason, the final\nsix letters of the English alphabet. The jewels\nhave to be rescued by KC, who is a suitcase.\nThe adventure provided for review was number\n3 in the series, Sport in Britain. The other four\nadventures are Arriving in London, Shopping in\nLondon, The Houses of Parliament and The\nTower of London.\nMuch of Sport in Britain is not an adventure at\nall. Instead, the teaching program consists of\nfour short texts in English, under 1,100 words in\ntotal, which appear in writing and which can be\nlistened to. There are translation and notepad\noptions. There is also a context icon which,\nwhen you highlight a word in the text, repeats\nthe word and the text verbatim - quite why I\nhave not discovered yet. There is also a facility\nto allow users to record any part of the text and\ncompare their speech with that of a native\nspeaker. The native-speaker recordings have a\nmarked background hiss and are not performed\nby actors. There are questions at the end of each\ntext, three or four questions of a gap-fill,\nmultiple-choice or Yes\/No type. When you get\nenough of these right, you can progress to a\nseries of crosswords, listening and gap filling\ngames where KC recovers the jewels if you get\nthe answers correct. The program runs very,\nvery slowly and there is no way of bailing out\nonce it has started.\nThe real problems, however, lie in the teaching\nmaterial. Four short reading texts and a handful\nof questions is very little indeed for a whole CD-\nROM. The text itself is dull and artificial. This\nsort of exchange, taken from the text called\n'conversation', is typical:\nNick: Oh, I think football is much more\nexciting than cricket, don't you?\nRob: Yes, I far prefer it. You can't beat a\ngood game of football.\n72\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 3\nNobody speaks like this in real life. Further, the\nwriting - and the thought it represents - are\nsloppy. I found myself instinctively reaching for\na red pen to correct it. For example:\nAthletics and water sports have traditionally\ntaken place in summer because of the weather.\nFloods may occur in winter because of the rain,\nbut athletics in summer is not an inevitable\nconsequence of heat and sunshine. The texts\nalso include frequent factual inaccuracies. I\nshall confine myself to pointing out that the\nwinners at Wimbledon do not receive large gold\nplates, the Charity Shield is not played between\nthe winners of the FA Cup and the League Cup,\nand a member of the royal family does not\nalways present the FA Cup. The questions on\nthe text - and there are incredibly few of them -\nare ill thought out. Material for the answers is\nnot always included in the text, and at least two\nmultiple-choice questions have more than one\npossible correct answer with the result that one\nis marked wrong. The answers to the games\nappear to rely on memorization of the texts\nrather than ability in English. Of course, this\nmay appeal to Arabic learners who will\notherwise find the content and level of this\nprogram a great challenge.\nAs one of my colleagues commented on trying\nthe program: 'If they try and learn from this\nsort of material in the Middle East, it's no\nwonder they're so bad at English.' This program\nwill not teach anybody English, although you\nmight enjoy playing with the games if you\nhappen to know English already.\nJames Milton, University of Wales Swansea\nBeing Digital by Nicholas Negroponte, London:\nCoronet Books (Hodder and Stoughton), 1996.\nISBN: 0-340-64930-5. 249 pages, paperback.\n\u00a36.99.\nThis is quite an intriguing book from which I\nhave often quoted material. As director of the\nMedia Lab at MIT, its author Nicholas\nNegroponte should be quite well-known to\nanyone who has delved into or who is working\nin the field of digital multimedia. In this book,\nNegroponte attempts to popularize the digital\nworld of computers by writing an accessible and\nreadable pocket book that can be read as easily\non. a beach as it could in a library. The\naccessibility of the book is reflected in the fact\nthat it has been translated into over thirty\ndifferent languages.\nBeing Digital is organized into seven basic parts:\nan introduction; eighteen chapters arranged into\nthree basic theme areas; an epilogue; an 'after\nwords'; and an acknowledgements section.\nThe introduction is subtitled The Paradox of a\nBook'. Here Negroponte explains why he has\ncommitted his thoughts, ideas, comments and\narguments to an 'old-fashioned book' when an\nelectronic book (of the type described later in\nChapter 5) might have been more appropriate.\nOne of the three reasons he gives for publishing\non paper rather than electronically is simply\nthat 'there are just not enough digital media in\nthe hands of executives, politicians, parents, and\nall those who most need to understand this\nradically new culture'.\nWithin the main body of the book, Part 1 deals\nwith the fundamental nature of digital\ninformation, its importance, how it can be\nmoved from one location to another, and the\nimplications of shifting from an analogue (or\n'atom-based') culture to a digital (*bit-based')\nworld of information. Part 2 is devoted to end-\nuser interfaces and human-computer\ninteraction. It discusses numerous topics, many\nof which were extensively researched in the early\ndays of the Media Lab. Some of the more\nimportant of these are interactivity, sensory\nrichness and machine intelligence; multimodal\ninterfaces (such as 'Put-That-There'); interac-\ntion devices; video conferencing; use of gestures;\ngraphical persona; virtual reality; telepresence\nand remote manipulators; speech input\/output;\nand intelligent interface agents. Part 3 deals\nwith 'Digital Life'; it discusses the various ways\nin which 'being digital' is likely to influence our\nlives in the years to come. The major issues\nconsidered in this section include the post-\ninformation age; time-shifting and video-on-\ndemand; wearable media; household robots;\nand email and the growing demand for and use\nof the Internet as a knowledge resource.\nLearning using LEGO\/Logo systems is also\ndiscussed, as is the importance of personal\ncomputers as educational tools. According to\nNegroponte (p. 220), through computers, 'ten\nyears from now, teenagers are likely to enjoy a\nmuch richer panorama of options because the\npursuit of intellectual achievement will not be\ntilted so much in favour of the book-worm, but\ninstead cater to a wider range of cognitive\nstyles, learning patterns, and expressive\nbehaviors'.\nIn the epilogue, Negroponte expresses some\n73\nReviews\nconcerns about the negative implications of the\ndigital age - unemployment, the misuse of\ntechnology, software piracy, and so on - but is\noptimistic about what he believes are the four\nredeeming qualities of being digital: its ability to\nachieve decentralization, globalization, harmon-\nization and empowerment.\nFinally, in the acknowledgements section, the\nauthor gives a concise person-oriented summary\nof both the history of the Media Lab and of the\nproduction of Being Digital.\nAlthough this book does not say anything\nexceptional or revolutionary, it does provide a\nhelpful synthesis of many useful and powerful\nideas relating to digital media and their use by\ncurrent and future societies. Sadly, there is no\nbibliography, and not even so much as a URL\nlink to a further reading list.\nHowever, in his excellent review of the\nhardback version of the book (ISBN: 0-340-\n64525-3), Joseph (The Computer Jour\/ia\/, volume\n39, number 3, 1996, page 252) suggests that\nBeing Digital should be 'required reading for\nevery computing student and professional'.

ISBN: 0-\n471-14859-8. 498 pages, paperback. \u00a319.99.\nDespite its popularity and pervasiveness, the\nWorld Wide Web (and many applications based\non it) has a number of constraints. Two of the\nmost significant of these are the limited\ninteractivity of Web pages, and the often low\nresponsiveness of many Web sites with respect\nto handling multimedia information. These\nlimitations are inherent in the way in which\nclient\/server applications are implemented using\nthe HTTP approach. In order to overcome these\n(and some of the other) limitations, Sun\nMicrosystems introduced in 1995 the Java\nprogramming language for Web applications -\nand the HotJava browser. According to Sun,\nJava is a 'simple, object-oriented, distributed,\ninterpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral,\nportable, high performance, multi-threaded and\ndynamic language'. This book provides a useful\nintroduction and guide to the Java language\nand its use for the creation of Web applets.\nThe book is organized into four basic parts.\nPart 1 (the first two chapters) is the shortest; it\ndescribes how to get and install the Java\ndevelopment kit, run the HotJava browser (and\nNetscape), and visit Java-enhanced sites on the\nWeb. Part 2 is the largest section (comprising\nChapters 3 to 12) and covers the nuts and bolts\nof Java. Part 3 (Chapters 13 to 17) deals with\nbuilding applets using a 'line-by-line' approach.\nFinally, Part 4 (three appendices) summarizes\nthe reference material available in the SDK and\nAPI packages, the standard libraries for\nhandling I\/O and network communication.\nPart 2, then, contains the details of the Java\nlanguage itself. The early chapters in this section\nprovide a basic introduction to Java (and object\norientation), a description of how to build Java\napplications using an appropriate development\nplatform (Unix, Mac or PC), and a review of\nJava-language basics. Subsequent chapters deal\nwith more detailed treatments of various\nprogramming topics such as flow of control;\nobjects and classes; interfaces; packages;\nmanaging data; handling exceptions; and\nthreads.\nHaving covered the basics, the author uses Part\n3 to cover the creation of applets that can be\nrun within a Java-capable browser such as\nHotJava or Netscape 2.0+. The first chapter in\nthis section provides an applet overview, and\nthe following chapters deal with applet basics,\nuser interfaces, graphics and multimedia. The\nimportant issues covered in these five chapters\ninclude in-line applets in HTML (the '<applet>'\ntag); parameter passing; alignment; the AWT\ndisplay model; layout classes; containers and\ncomponents; user-interface components\nprovided by AWT; event handling; frames,\nwindows and dialogues; drawing methods; use\nof images; using MediaTracker; and sound clips\nand animation.\nAlthough this is a technical book, it is extremely\nreadable, and is relatively free of typographical\nerrors and coding mistakes. It contains lots of\nwell-thought out examples to illustrate the\npoints being made. In fact, anyone wanting to\nlearn how to create dynamic, interactive Web\npages will find it a useful starting point -\nprovided they have at least some programming\nexperience. Unfortunately, however, despite its\nusefulness, what this book does not do to any\ngreat extent is to point to any of the significant\nweaknesses of this approach to creating applets.\nFor those wishing to follow up this issue, a\nuseful diving-in point would be the discussion\npresented by Ted Lewis in the June 1996 edition\n74\nALT-} Volume 4 Number 3\nof IEEE Computer (volume 29, number 6, pages\n8-9). Worth mentioning too, for those who are\nfamiliar with C programming, is that there is a\ncompanion book entitled Java for C\/C++\nProgrammers (ISBN: 0-471-15324-9; also\npublished by Wiley).\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nLearners on the Superhighway by Keith\nYeomans, Leicester National Institute of Adult\nContinuing Education (NIACE), 1996. ISBN: 1-\n872941-96-6. 112 pages, paperback. \u00a36.50.\nThis is a report of a study-tour in North\nAmerica, undertaken in 1994 by Keith\nYeomans, of organizations and individuals\ninvolved in educational communications. The\naim of the research was to identify areas of good\npractice and strategy which might be relevant to\nfuture developments in the UK and Europe.\nIn the opening chapter, Yeomans sets out a\nsummary of his conclusions. Among the most\nimportant of these are that policy makers and\nresearchers in the field should raise awareness of\nthe educational potential of telecom-\nmunications, arrange for local and regional\ndemand to be quantified, develop strategies to\nminimize costs, set up local learning networks,\nensure that the communications industry make\nfull use of cross-sectoral partnerships, and so\nforth. These and related suggestions are\nexpanded in the next five short chapters.\nIt would be hard to find many people who\nwould disagree with the views expressed. Who,\nbesides the odd Luddite, would not concede\nthat the Information Superhighway represents a\nnew opportunity for teachers, and for students\nof all ages and in all locations? Yeomans does\nidentify certain interesting differences in\nattitude between Europe and the USA, such as\nthe fact that in Europe, with our public-service\nculture, we find it hard to understand the\nAmerican commercial attitude towards using\nthe Internet for education. And he does make\nsome points which still need to be hammered\nhome even though so many of us have aching\narms, such as the danger that telematic\neducation, despite its potential for wide\ndissemination of learning, may in practice widen\nthe gap between the haves and have-nots. But\nthe overall impression one has after reading this\nreport is that one has been surprised about very\nlittle its author has said.\nAlthough the book is 112 pages long, the body\nof it ends on page 55. All the rest is given over\nto two appendices: Contributor Profiles, and\nDocuments. The first is a 40-page descriptive\nlist of North American companies, educational\nestablishments and people contacted by\nYeomans. The second is a list of books, reports\nand the like which he collected during the\nperiod of his research. Such lists can come in\nuseful, but there is a great deal in them which -\nI am sure - nobody in the UK will ever need,\nand, in the case of the documents, would ever be\nable to obtain if they did need them, other than\nby contacting Yeomans personally.\nThe reader will have gathered that I have not\nbeen terribly convinced by the usefulness of this\npublication for ALT members. But it would be\nunfair and misleading to end my review\nnegatively. For a start, Yeoman's pedigree as a\nspecialist in the field is not in doubt - indeed, he\nis experienced, fairly well known and has done\nsome excellent work. Certainly, a considerable\namount of effort has gone into writing this\nreport. Further, despite my reservations, some\npeople may read it with interest, and may find it\nquite useful if writing about telematics in the\nUSA, and\/or to cite in learned articles (for that,\nall the right words and phrases are there for the\ntaking). Finally, \u00a36.50 is hardly expensive when\ncompared with the price of some commercial\nreports which run to hundreds of pounds, which\nare written in cliches and platitudes calculated\nto provoke intense irritation, and which contain\nno new material at all.\nGabriel Jacobs, University of Wales Swansea\nUsing Activities in Training and Development by\nLeslie Rae, London: Kogan Page, 1996. ISBN: 0-\n7494-1891-5.214 pages, paperback, \u00a319.99.\nThis book catalogues and discusses the range of\nactivities available for use in learning and\ntraining. Although it is not therefore about\ncomputer-based learning directly, I wondered\nwhether it might act as a source of ideas or a set\nof guidelines for activities supported or\npromoted by computer-based learning\ntechnology.\nThere are two main sections. The first six\nchapters deal with factors common across all\ntypes of activities, beginning with a brief\ntheoretical justification based on the ideas of\nKolb, and Honey and Mumford, of why\nlearning through activity can be effective. This\nis followed by a discussion of the practical\ndecisions required in the planning, selection and\n75\nReviews\npreparation of activities, such as ways of\nconstituting groups and the use of instruction\nsheets. The rest of the section then concentrates\non techniques for observing, recording and\nreviewing the actions of participants. We are\nreminded that 'in many cases as much, if not\nmore learning emerges from a review or\ndiscussion of the activity as from the activity\nitself. The section therefore considers strategies\nand methods for observing interactions between\npairs and within groups. There is a chapter on\nthe use of activity analysis for recording the\nincidence of agreed kinds of behaviour such as\ngiving information, summarizing, and so on. All\nof this is presented at a firmly practical level\nthat avoids the complexities usually introduced\nby texts on behaviour analysis and research\nmethods, and is clearly pitched at practitioners\nrather than theorists. The last chapter in the\nsection considers different ways of providing\nfeedback to participants during debriefing\nsessions. The author identifies this as the most\nessential stage of all, and this chapter looks the\nmost useful.\nSection 2 consists of seven chapters describing\nspecific types of activities. Most of these are\nconcerned with interpersonal activities such as\nintroductions and energizers, one-to-one\nactivities such as role-play, group questions and\ndiscussions, and experiential activities such as\nT-Groups for raising sensitivity and awareness.\nThese chapters have a common structure that\nincludes a description of each activity,\nmembership and timing requirements, planning\nand design, usage, examples and variations.\nThere is plenty of practical guidance about\ndifferent ways in which the activities can be\norganized and about the avoidance of possible\nproblems. Much of this might be useful to\nlecturers in higher education considering\nalternative ways of running group tutorials,\nalthough there is little about dealing with stale\nand weary students, and the touchy-feely kinds\nof activities would be of limited use in many\ndisciplines. There is an amusing section on how\nto run a bad discussion (e.g. start by going on at\nlength with your own opinions and then\ninterrupt and disagree with others'\ncontributions), but then it is one thing to know\nthe right and wrong things to do and another to\napply them in practice.\nThose of us interested primarily in computer-\nsupported activities would probably turn first to\nthe chapters on structured group activities, and\ncase studies and simulations. Rae's only\nreferences to computers appear here, with a\nbrief mention that simulation used to be an\nunwieldy matter before computers were\navailable to present reports, statistics and other\ninformation, or to simulate more dynamic\nvirtual worlds, or to act as analytical or\ncommunication tools. Given that many\nauthorities now recognize that the success and\neffectiveness of computer-supported activities\ndepends as much on their social and\norganizational context as on their supporting\ntechnology (e.g. Laurillard, 1992; Kaye 1992,\npp. 14-15), Rae's practical emphasis on\neffective preparation and organization is\nappropriate. It is not a good idea to give\nstudents a computer-based activity and just\nleave them to get on with it. The checklists in\nthe book might help in avoiding otherwise\nunforeseen difficulties, and the activity\ndescriptions might help in the design of new\nactivities, for example by applying the list of\ndifferent kinds of documents that might be used\nin an in-tray activity.\nClearly the book is written from a great deal of\npersonal experience of working with most of the\nactivities it covers. It provides a gentle\nintroduction to the wide range of activities\navailable to lecturers and teachers. But in\nattempting to discuss learning activities in a\nsubject-free way, independent of specific\ndisciplines, the book tends towards far too\nmany generalities. At the end is a list of\npublished activity resources. The topic areas\nthey cover, such as customer care, assertiveness,\ncounselling, managing stress, communication\nand leadership, reinforced my feeling that the\nbook is really orientated towards the\ndevelopment of personal and interpersonal\nskills for managers, trainers and the like. It is\ndifficult to relate this to learning technology in\nthe computer-based sense.\nReferences\nKaye, A.
