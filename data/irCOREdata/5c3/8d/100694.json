The interac-\ntion between the localized N states and the conduction band\n\u0001CB\u0002 minimum has been effectively modeled with both the\nband anticrossing \u0001BAC\u0002 model2 and the empirical pseudo-\npotential method.3 This has recently led to activity in dilute\nnitrides based on GaP where the fraction of nitrogen can be\ncarefully controlled via molecular beam epitaxy \u0001MBE\u0002\ngrowth. Additionally, yellow-amber-red GaNP LEDs may of-\nfer better device characteristics than current AlInGaP devices\ndue to a weaker dependence of the band gap4 and lower\nthermal resistivity.5 In this letter, we investigate the validity\nof a simple BAC model in GaNP-based materials and con-\nsider the factors limiting the electro-optic efficiency of LEDs\nbased on GaNP.\nThe devices studied here were grown by MBE and uti-\nlize simplified chip processing by one-step growth on trans-\nparent 350 \u0002m thick n-type GaP \u0001100\u0002 substrates. The epi-\ntaxial layers consist of a 0.3 \u0002m thick n-GaP layer\n\u0001Si doped\u0002, 0.15 \/0.1 \/0.15 \u0002m thick undoped\nGaP \/GaN0.006P0.994 \/GaP active region, and 0.8 \u0002m thick\np-GaP \u0001Be doped\u0002 contact layer. LED chips were fabricated\nusing Ge \/Au \/Ni \/Au and AuZn metallization for n- and\np-type contacts, respectively.\nWe employ temperature dependent measurements per-\nformed with a standard closed cycle cryostat setup over the\ntemperature range of 70\u2013300 K. This gives temperature and\ncurrent dependencies of the electroluminescence \u0001EL\u0002 spec-\ntra. The application of high hydrostatic pressure causes an\nincrease in the direct band gap, and a reduction in the indi-\nrect X minima, thereby allowing investigations of the band\nstructure and leakage effects into the indirect minima of GaP.\nPressure dependent measurements were performed over the\nrange of 0\u201310 kbar using gaseous helium as the pressure\nmedium. In the dilute nitrides, high pressure can also be used\nto tune the interaction between the nitrogen level\u0001s\u0002 and the\nconduction band of the host material, forming a useful means\nof investigating the validity of the BAC model.2,6\u20139\nShown in Fig. 1 is the pressure dependence of the EL\npeak energy position \u0001squares\u0002, taken from EL spectra of\nGaNP LEDs, which blueshifts with increasing pressure at\na rate of +1.6 meV \/kbar, consistent with previous\nspectroscopic2 and theoretical3 studies. Also shown are the\npressure dependencies of the \u0001 and X minima of GaP. It can\nbe clearly seen that the change of the peak energy does not\ncorrelate with either minima, suggesting that the emission\npeak is strongly influenced by the addition of nitrogen. It is,\ntherefore, interesting to see if the BAC model can describe\nthis pressure dependence. This simple model9 describes the\neffects of nitrogen in dilute nitrides and allows the prediction\nof temperature and pressure dependencies of CB states.

We note that this is large com-\npared with previous reported values for the GaInNAs \/GaAs\nsystem for which CNM is typically between 1.26 \u0001Ref. 6\u0002 and\n2.7 eV.13 Figure 2 shows EL spectra taken at room tempera-\nture and 70 K. Below 110 K, additional sharp emission\npeaks become visible which can be associated with N\u2013N pair\nstates and N cluster levels.14 Owing to the multiplicity of\nthese levels, the two-level BAC model cannot completely\ndescribe the GaNP system, confirming the reports of Gunger-\nich et al.15 We note here that Kent and Zunger\u2019s supercell\nand multiband empirical pseudopotential calculations agree\nwith our observed positive pressure coefficient,3 suggesting\nthat the conduction band edge of GaNP is more \u201cdirect-like.\u201d\nHowever, they conclude that intervalley coupling and band\nanticrossing between all nitrogen perturbed host states\n\u0001\u0001-X-L\u0002 and a consideration of cluster states is required to\ngive a complete description of the effect of nitrogen incor-\nporation in GaP. Nevertheless, a simple two-level BAC\nmodel based on an \u201caverage\u201d of the nitrogen levels provides\na useful predictive tool for the pressure dependence of the\npeak emission at room temperature and, hence, may be use-\nful for tuning the properties of devices based upon this\nmaterial.\nWhen considering the thermal behavior of the LEDs we\nfind that, for a fixed current, the intensity reduces strongly\nwith increasing temperature. This is consistent with a tem-\nperature dependent carrier leakage path. We note that in\nthese structures, ignoring Coulombic effects, the valence\nband offset is zero and, hence, hole leakage is likely to occur.\nHowever, while it will decrease the efficiency of the devices,\nit is unlikely to be particularly temperature or pressure sen-\nsitive. The energy separation between the Fermi-level and\nthe X minima of the GaP has been calculated to be\n\u0003200 meV, while this is relatively large when compared\nwith the AlInGaP material system, carrier leakage into the X\nminima may nevertheless occur and contribute to the tem-\nperature dependence due to the large density of states of the\nX minima. In Figure 3, we show an Arrhenius plot of the\nmeasured temperature dependence of the integrated EL.\nFrom the slope of this plot, we may determine \u0003E, the en-\nergy separation between the conduction band quasi-Fermi\nlevel and the leakage level \u0001here, the GaP X minima\u0002. The\ninset of Fig. 3 shows the current dependence of the extracted\nvalues of \u0003E, which can be seen to decrease with increasing\ncurrent. This is consistent with the Fermi level increasing in\nenergy and moving toward the GaP X minima, as more car-\nriers are injected. At low current, \u0003E is less than 200 meV,\nand shows the Fermi level has already passed the E\n\u2212\nlevel. At\nhigh current, \u0003E tends to level off with increasing current,\nconsistent with the large density of states in the X minima of\nGaP.\nFurther investigations of the importance of the GaP X\nminima can be determined with the use of high pressure. We\nmay assume that carriers can flow via two paths; radiatively\nproducing a photon, or thermally leaking into the indirect\nbarrier regions and recombining nonradiatively. Since pres-\nsure reduces the \u0001-X intervalley separation, it may be used to\nprobe the importance of this leakage path. In the presence of\na leakage process, the radiative component of the injected\ncurrent Jrad associated with the light emission may be written\nas\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Measured EL spectra at 70 and 295 K for currents 20,\n50, 100, and 150 mA, showing the multiple peaks at low temperature.

Arrhenius plot of the integrated electroluminescence for GaNP\nLEDs at 5\u201330 mA in 5 mA steps. The slope of the curve relates to the\nenergy splitting \u0003E between the conduction band quasi-Fermi level and the\nX minima of the GaP barrier, which can be seen in the inset to decrease with\nincreasing current, as expected.\n021101-2 Chamings et al.

The decrease in EL intensity with\npressure is strong evidence that carrier leakage into the X\nminima is significant. From earlier, the pressure coefficient\nof the emission peak energy and the X minima in GaP is\nknown. Thus, d\u0003E \/dP=\u22123.1 meV \/kbar. Substituting this\nvalue of d\u0003E \/dP into Eq. \u00011\u0002 yields the solid line shown in\nFig. 4. This provides an excellent agreement with the experi-\nmental data confirming that leakage into the X minima of\nGaP is the important nonradiative recombination process in\nthese devices.\nIn summary, we have presented temperature and high\npressure investigations into the material properties and de-\nvice characteristics of GaNP-based LEDs. The evidence of\nseveral N levels in low temperature electroluminescence\nshow that while the BAC model cannot fully describe this\nsystem, it can be used as a predictive tool based upon an\naverage N position. Furthermore, high pressure measure-\nments have shown that carrier leakage into the X minima of\nthe GaP limits the efficiency of these devices.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge EPSRC and the\nSET2 consortium for financial support, and Alf Adams for\nuseful discussions.
