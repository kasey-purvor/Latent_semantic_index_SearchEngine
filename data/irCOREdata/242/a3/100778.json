Internal\ncharging is one of the primary hazards for any spacecraft in MEO,\nand accordingly, the Galileo test satellite, Giove-A, carries a de-\ntector, SURF, to undertake the measurement of internal charging\ncurrents at three different shielding depths. The currents are due\nto electrons stopped in three aluminum plates: the first plate is\n0.5 mm thick and located under 0.5-mm Al-equivalent shielding,\nthe second is 0.5 mm thick and located underneath the first plate,\nand the third is 1.0 mm thick and located underneath the second\nplate. Giove-A was successfully launched on December 28, 2005\ninto a 23 300-km circular 56\u25e6 inclination orbit. In this paper,\nwe provide data on the internal charging currents observed in\n2006, with particular emphasis on two large charging events, one\nin mid-April and one in mid-December. Comparisons are made\nto predictions using the DICTAT internal charging tool and the\nFLUMIC \u201cworst case\u201d trapped electron belt model. In general,\nthe charging currents observed are safely within the standard\nDICTAT 3.5\/FLUMIC 3.0 predictions but are exceeded in the\nmost shielded plate on five calendar days during December 2006.\nThe December event was unique in 2006 in that it was triggered\nby the arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME) rather than\nbeing due to the effects of a fast solar wind stream flowing from\na coronal hole. The currents measured in the December event\nwere, however, an order of magnitude lower than those predicted\nusing the \u201canomalously large event\u201d supplement to FLUMIC\nwhich models the most extreme electron enhancements associated\nwith CMEs.\nIndex Terms\u2014Energetic electron belts, internal charging,\nmedium Earth orbit (MEO).\nI.

It is well known that the outer\nbelt is highly dynamic and prone to regular enhancements of\nthe energetic electron population which can be triggered by\npersistent fast solar wind streams or coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs) [1], [2]. Many anomalies on Earth-orbiting satellites\nhave been correlated with such electron belt enhancements [3],\n[4], and these anomalies are frequently attributed to the process\nof internal charging [5]\u2013[7]. In this mechanism, energetic elec-\ntrons penetrate the outer shielding of the spacecraft but are\neventually brought to a stop, therefore depositing a charge at\nthe end of their track. During enhancement events, the flux of\npenetrating electrons can increase by orders of magnitude. If, at\na particular location, the charge leakage rate is low compared\nto the arrival rate (e.g., dielectrics or isolated metal items),\nthen over time (typically one to two days), enough charge can\nbe deposited for dielectric strengths to be exceeded and an\ninternal electrostatic discharge may occur. Such discharges can\ncause an electronic circuit upset or even permanent damage\nto an electronic component. This process has been reproduced\nin both flight- and ground-based experiments, e.g., [8]\u2013[10].\nHence, there is strong interest in monitoring charging rates at\ntypical shielding depths in the Galileo orbit so that protection\nstrategies can be optimized.\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) has launched a test satel-\nlite, Giove-A, into a 23 300-km circular 56\u25e6 inclination orbit.\nOne of its objectives is to measure the radiation environment\nencountered in MEO. Some initial data from the two monitors\nonboard, \u201cMerlin\u201d and \u201cCEDEX,\u201d have already been reported\n[11]. Merlin, shown in Fig. 1, provides monitoring of internal\ncharging rates, total ionizing doses, energetic proton fluxes,\nand ion linear energy transfer spectra. Of particular interest for\ncharging studies is the \u201cSURF\u201d detector located within Merlin,\nwhich measures internal charging currents at three different\nshielding depths.\nII. SURF DETECTOR WITHIN MERLIN\nThe SURF detector was first described in 1999 [12] and\nwas proven in space in 2000 on the STRV1d satellite in geo-\nstationary transfer orbit [13]. For the Giove-A mission, SURF\ncomprises three shielded aluminum collector plates mounted in\na stack as shown in Fig. 2. The first plate is 0.5 mm thick and\nlocated under a 0.5-mm Al-equivalent shielding; the second is\n0.5 mm thick and located under the first plate (plus shield); the\n0093-3813\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Merlin\u2013Giove-A instrument showing the main detector board: SURF\nis the large diameter circular detector. Also visible are the particle telescopes\nfor protons and ions and the RadFETs for total dose measurement. The power\nand data handling functions are located on the lower board (hidden).\nFig. 2. General configuration of the SURF shielded plates in Merlin\u2013Giove-A.\nthird is 1.0 mm thick and located under the second plate. Each\nof the three collector plates is connected to an electrometer to\nmeasure deposited current. These dimensions are representative\nof typical thicknesses of dielectrics within spacecraft. The plate\ndiameter (70 mm) is chosen to ensure that currents are within\na measurable range when within the belt, allowing sufficient\nheadroom to ensure that exceptionally severe environments will\nbe captured. The dominant particle type is indicated by the\npolarity of the current detected. Within the electron belts, we\nexpect (and observe) this current to be negative, i.e., the depo-\nsition of electrons in the plates is always dominant. Any de-\nposited protons will of course contribute a positive current but\nthe outer belt proton population is negligible except during solar\nparticle events (SPEs). Of course, from a charging perspective,\nit is only the net current which is of importance; therefore,\nSURF accurately reports the charging threat. Simulations using\nMULASSIS (see Appendix A) show that, even during major\nSPEs, the magnitude of the proton currents are small compared\nto the electron currents. In fact, this resilience to the effects\nof protons, confirmed by earlier observations from within the\nintense inner belt [9], means that SURF is also useful as an\nelectron detector in its own right because traditional devices\n(based on particle counting) are often readily contaminated in\nmixed electron\/proton environments.\nSURF was calibrated prior to launch by injecting known\ncurrents into the plates: the calibration is traceable to national\nFig. 3. Response functions for the three SURF plates obtained using the\nDICTAT tool. The environment was isotropic with intensity of\n1 e cm\u22122sr\u22121s\u22121.\nFig. 4. Currents detected in the three SURF plates during preflight test\nexposures in the REEF. The results here correspond to two different ranges\nof the electron point source (Sr-90 pellet) from the top plane of the Merlin unit.\nstandards. Because the detector itself is inert (i.e., metal plate),\nthe amplifier chain is the only potential cause of calibration\ndrift. To monitor any variation in electrometer performance,\na control channel is provided which is simply an identical\nelectrometer\/amplifier chain not connected to any plate. The\ncontrol channel enables any drift to be corrected, although this\nhas not been needed to date.\nSimple 1-D modeling of the SURF plates using the ESA\nDICTAT tool [14], [15] has enabled the approximate response\nfunctions to be plotted\u2014see Fig. 3. The electron environment\nselected within DICTAT at each discrete energy point was\nisotropic with intensity of 1 e cm\u22122 sr\u22121 s\u22121. According to\nthese results the electron energies of peak sensitivity for each\nplate are approximately 1.0, 1.5, and 2.1 MeV for top, middle,\nand lower plates, respectively.\nPrior to launch, SURF was tested in the QinetiQ Realistic\nElectron Environment Facility (REEF) which simulates the\nouter belt electron environment using a 3.7-GBq strontium-\n90 beta emitter [16]. Sr-90 produces a continuous spectrum\nof electrons from 0 up to 2.2 MeV. The results from two in\nvacuum exposures with different source-to-target ranges are\nshown in Fig. 4. These exposures provided confirmation of\npreflight operation and also enable cross-checking of model\nresults against a reference case.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Magnitude of the (negative) internal charging currents measured by\nSURF in the 24 h after unit switch-on. Also plotted are geomagnetic coordinates\nB and L. Each passage through the outer belt is clearly seen with a notable\npeak on either side of the crossing of the geomagnetic equator (minima in B).\nThe small currents registered outside of the belt (large L) are instrument bias\ncurrents.\nIII. FLIGHT DATA\nSURF has been operational on Giove-A since shortly after\nthe launch on 28 December 2005. Fig. 5 is a plot of the\nmagnitude of the currents (picoamperes per square centimeter)\ndetected in the three plates for the first 24 h after SURF\nactivation. All currents observed are negative in polarity. Also\nshown in Fig. 5 are the B, L values obtained from the\nTsyganenko 89 [17] external magnetic field model. The internal\nfield model was IGRF\/DGRF with epoch set at 1994. Each\npassage of Giove-A through the outer belt is evident along\nwith a distinctive \u201cdouble peak\u201d\u2014this feature arises due to\nthe circular orbital path of Giove-A through the outer belt,\nwhich possesses a crescent-shape cross section. On these days,\nGiove-A crosses the geomagnetic equatorial plane below the\nL-value where the flux is at its peak.\nIt is interesting to compare the relative magnitude of the\ncurrents in the three plates to those seen in the REEF tests.\nWhile following the same order, i.e., Jtop > Jmiddle > Jbottom\nwhere J is the current density deposited in each plate; the ratios\nbetween the currents are greater in the flight data from late\nDecember 2005 indicating a softer electron spectrum at that\ntime than that provided by REEF.\nFig. 6 is a plot of the SURF internal charging currents mea-\nsured at the crossings of the geomagnetic equator (B\/B0 \u223c 1)\nfrom January\u2013June 2006. These crossings correspond to L\nvalues of approximately 4.75 in quiet times. Giove-A was\nlaunched at the beginning of a period of outer belt enhancement,\nwhich peaked a few days later and then subsided over the\nnext few weeks. A new belt enhancement occurred in late\nJanuary 2006 and enhancement events continued to occur at\napproximately 27-day (i.e., solar rotation) intervals throughout\nthe first six months of 2006. These enhancements were as-\nsociated with a persistent midlatitude solar coronal hole, first\nobserved in October 2005 as STAR catalog no. CH 192 [18],\nwhich sent fast (> 700 km s\u22121) solar wind streams toward the\nEarth at approximately 27-day intervals (synodic solar rotation\nperiod). This particular coronal hole was very long lived, lasting\nthrough to September 2006. The large event in mid-April is\nFig. 6. Internal charging currents detected at the crossings of the geomagnetic\nequator (i.e., B\/B0 \u223c 1) from January to June 2006 by the SURF detector on\nGiove-A. The points plotted correspond to L \u223c 4.75. Electron belt enhance-\nments occur roughly every 27-day solar rotation interval over this period.\nFig. 7. Profile of charging currents around the orbit during the electron\nenhancement event in April 2006. A single peak is now observed together with\na harder spectrum. Note that the current in the bottom plate is very similar to\nthat in the middle plate, noting of course that the bottom plate is thicker than\nthe other two.\nassociated with the improved efficiency of electron acceleration\nat the equinoxes.\nDuring the April event, the profile of the currents around the\norbit was significantly modified as shown in Fig. 7. The double\npeak has disappeared which suggests that the location of the\npeak of the outer belt in the plane of the geomagnetic equator\nhas moved to a lower L-value, i.e., below that at which Giove-A\ncrosses the geomagnetic equator. The charging currents shown\nin Fig. 7 now indicate a harder electron spectrum than that\nprovided by REEF. The ratio Jtop\/Jmiddle at the geomagnetic\nequator crossing had a value of approximately two in mid-April\n2006, whereas it was as high as four in late December 2005.\nThe ratio Jmiddle\/Jbottom was about one in mid-April 2006 but\nabout two in late December 2005. While the Jmiddle\/Jbottom\nratio of \u223c1 may at first seem surprising, it should be recalled\nthat the bottom plate is twice as thick as the middle plate.\nFig. 8 shows internal charging currents at the crossings of\nthe geomagnetic equator (B\/B0 \u223c 1) for the second half of\n2006. Enhancements continued to occur frequently over this\nperiod, although the picture was more complex due to the\nappearance and decay of a number of midlatitude coronal holes.\nIn addition, an Earth-directed CME occurred on December 13,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Internal charging currents recorded at the crossings of the geomagnetic\nequator (i.e., B\/B0 \u223c 1) in MEO from July to December 2006 by the SURF\ndetector. The points plotted correspond to L \u223c 4.75.\n2006 [19], [20] which led to an outer belt enhancement of\nsimilar magnitude to that seen in April 2006.\nIV. COMPARISON TO THE DICTAT\/FLUMIC\nENGINEERING MODEL\nElectron enhancement events are of engineering significance,\nand we need to compare the observed data to worst case models\nused when designing protection for satellites. DICTAT is ESA\u2019s\nengineering tool for evaluation of internal charging hazards\n[14] and is available worldwide via the Spenvis system [15].\nDICTAT models the electron environment around the orbit,\ndetermines the electron transport and deposition rates, and\nalso calculates the electric fields within dielectrics. DICTAT is\nparticularly valuable in that it can cope with any Earth orbit\nincluding MEO.\nFor the outer belt electron environment, DICTAT uses the\nFLUMIC model [21] which is an empirical worst case flux\nmodel specifically created for the purpose of internal charging\nanalysis and protection. The FLUMIC model creates a worst\ncase envelope around the peak one-day fluxes recorded by\nvarious detectors over the 1980s and 1990s and generalizes to\nother regions and periods. The model returns one-day mean\nfluxes because this is the time period relevant to internal\ncharging in typical dielectrics\u2014instantaneous peaks are not of\ngreat significance. The creators of FLUMIC necessarily made\nmany assumptions and simplifications due to the paucity of\nmeasurements available, the variety of detectors from which\ndata are drawn, uncertainties over calibration, very limited\nsampling of energy, L and B, and, in many cases, the sporadic\nnature of coverage periods. FLUMIC gives the one-day mean\nelectron flux as a function of the parameters B, L, season of the\nyear, and fraction of the solar cycle. The version of FLUMIC\nreferred to in this paper is 3.0 [22].\nFor electron transport and deposition, DICTAT uses an an-\nalytical approach in line with the need for rapid run times. In\naddition, the scale of uncertainties in both the environment and\nmaterial parameters would not justify the attempt to achieve a\nvery high level of accuracy in the radiation transport aspects of\nthe code. The version of DICTAT referred to in this paper is 3.5.\nData from SURF are a valuable test of the output from\nthe first two stages of DICTAT, i.e., the electron environment\nFig. 9. One-day averages of internal charging current in the SURF plates\ncompared to the DICTAT 3.5 predictions. The DICTAT predictions using\nboth FLUMIC 3.0 and ALE electron environments are shown. The standard\nDICTAT\/FLUMIC prediction is breached in the bottom plate during the\nDecember event.\nand the electron transport\/deposition calculations. The DICTAT\n3.5\/FLUMIC 3.0 model has been run to calculate the predicted\ninternal charging currents in the collector plates for the Giove-A\norbit over 2006. The one-day mean currents predicted by\nDICTAT\/FLUMIC are compared to the Giove-A SURF data\nfrom 2006 in Fig. 9. A one-day mean of SURF data is plotted\nbecause this is the timescale on which the FLUMIC model is\nbased. It can be seen that, in general, a margin of safety exists\nbetween predictions and observations as would be expected for\na \u201cworst-case\u201d model such as FLUMIC.\nThe peak currents observed in each plate are quite similar in\nthe April and December events (the peak days for the top plate\nwere April 15 and December 15, respectively). Whereas the\nDICTAT\/FLUMIC envelope is not exceeded in April, it is ex-\nceeded for the bottom plate on five separate days in December.\nThis is because the seasonal modulation function within\nFLUMIC depresses the predicted currents near the solstices.\nThe currents observed in December are however still within the\nDICTAT predictions for the equinoxes.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In fact, CMEs can produce some of the\nmost severe outer belt enhancements, and the FLUMIC model\nincludes a supplement to cover these, albeit rare, \u201canomalously\nlarge enhancements\u201d (ALEs). The currents predicted using the\nALE spectrum as an input to DICTAT are also shown in Fig. 9\non each panel. Note that the ALE supplement has no seasonal or\nsolar cycle dependence. The observed currents in the December\nCME-induced enhancement are less than those predicted using\nthe ALE spectrum by about an order of magnitude. Further\noccurrences of SPE-\/CME-related enhancements are expected\nas we move toward solar maximum.\nV. EXAMINATION OF SPECTRA\nFLUMIC models the worst case electron energy spectrum\nusing a simple exponential function together with an associated\ne-folding energy\nF (> E) = F0 \u00b7 exp\u2212(E\/E0) (1)\nwhere\nE electron energy (MeV);\nE0 folding energy (MeV);\nF (> E) integral flux (per square centimeter per second per\nsteradian);\nF0 integral flux E > 0 (per square centimeter per\nsecond per steradian).\nNote that the validity of FLUMIC is limited to E > 200 keV\nbecause it does not attempt or need to model the low energy\nelectron population.\nWith knowledge of the plate response functions (see\nSection II), it is possible to derive a best fit exponential spec-\ntrum (i.e., E0, F0) from the SURF data for any point in time. A\nsimple method has been used to carry out this task as described\nin Appendix B. For the internal charging problem, the spectrum\nduring periods when fluxes are at their highest is of greatest\nconcern. The fitted spectra derived from SURF data for the\npeak days (in terms of current in the top plate) of the April\nand December enhancements (i.e., fifteenth of each month)\nare shown in Fig. 10 (L \u223c 4.75, B\/B0 \u223c 1) along with the\nFLUMIC 3.0 spectra for the same dates. Also, shown is the\nALE spectrum and the AE8 min spectrum [23] for L = 4.75,\nB\/B0 = 1. The observed spectra for the two peak days are\nquite similar, although harder than predicted by the standard\nFLUMIC. The gradients of the lines (i.e., \u201chardness\u201d) are in\nfact closer to the ALE slope than to those obtained from the\nstandard FLUMIC model.\nIn practice, the spectrum changes continually. The value\nof Eo (obtained from the fitting process) at each geomag-\nnetic equator crossing throughout 2006 is shown in Fig. 11\nalong with the > 0.6- and > 2-MeV fluxes (similarly obtained).\nRepeating cycles of hardening and softening of the electron\nspectrum are evident, and these are well correlated with the\nelectron enhancements. The spectrum hardens as each event\nprogresses and then softens again suddenly at the start of\nthe next.\nFig. 10. Observed electron spectra for April 15, 2006 and December 15, 2006\n(L = 4.75, B\/B0 = 1) compared with the FLUMIC (v3.0), ALE, and AE8\nmin spectra for the same location. Of course, AE8 is an average model rather\nthan a worst case and is provided for reference only.\nFig. 11. Electron fluxes and e-folding energies at the Giove-A geomagnetic\nequator crossings in 2006. This plot is obtained from the fitting of simple\nexponential spectra to the SURF internal charging data. Repeated hardening\nand softening of the spectrum is well correlated with the enhancement events.\nNote that a larger Eo indicates a harder spectrum.\nCloser examination of Fig. 11 shows that, in the December\nenhancement event, the peak fluxes of both > 0.6- and > 2-MeV\nelectrons occurred on the same day (i.e., December 15) and Eo\nwas 0.61 MeV. In the April event, the peak flux of > 0.6-MeV\nelectrons occurred two days prior to the peak flux of > 2-MeV\nelectrons which occurred on April 17. In this case, Eo was\n0.76 MeV on April 15, increasing to 0.96 MeV on the\nseventeenth.\nVI. COMPARISON TO GOES MEASUREMENTS\nThe NOAA GOES satellites provide continuous monitoring\nof the outer electron belt [24] from geostationary orbit: the\nGOES > 2.0- and > 0.6-MeV electron flux measurements are\nwidely used for internal charging studies. A comparison with\nthe SURF MEO data is thus of interest even though the B,\nL ranges of the two missions do not actually overlap. Fig. 12\nshows a plot comparing the > 2-MeV flux reported by GOES-\n12 with the > 2-MeV flux derived from fitting the SURF\ndata to exponential form. From this plot, it appears that many\nenhancement events are more persistent in MEO than GEO.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

CONCLUSION\nThe SURF detector within Merlin has recorded internal\ncharging currents at three shielding depths in MEO through-\nout 2006. These charging data show in particular the effects\nof recurrent outer belt enhancements due to the influence of\nmidlatitude solar coronal holes. The enhancements display a\nvery clear periodicity of approximately 27 days in the first half\nof the year. Regular enhancements are in line with expectations\nfor this part of the solar cycle (close to solar minimum) because\ncoronal holes continue to occur frequently, even though the\npeak period is usually in the declining phase of the solar cycle.\nThe internal charging currents detected around the Giove-A\norbit are seen to vary considerably in profile both within and\nbetween enhancement events.\nThere were two enhancements in 2006 which were notably\nlarger than the rest, one in mid-April and one in mid-December.\nThe former was associated with a fast solar wind stream cou-\npled with the efficient energization of the belt near an equinox,\nwhereas the latter was associated with the arrival of a CME.\nThe peak instantaneous currents recorded during these two\nevents were quite similar, being approximately 1 pA cm\u22122 for\nthe top plate (0.5-mm Al shield, 0.5-mm Al collector) and\n0.4 pA cm\u22122 for both the middle plate (1.0-mm Al shield,\n0.5-mm Al collector) and the bottom plate (1.5-mm Al shield,\n1.0-mm Al collector). The observed one-day mean charging\ncurrents in the three SURF plates have remained within the\nFLUMIC\/DICTAT worst case envelope over the year except\nfor five calendar days during December when the current in\nthe bottom plate exceeded the prediction (although still within\nthe DICTAT\/FLUMIC worst case for 2006 which occurs at the\nequinoxes). An improvement to DICTAT would be for the user\nto input simply the start and end dates of the mission to ensure\nthat the seasonal modulation is fully accounted for, rather than\nhaving to choose a specific date to run the model.\nAs mentioned before, the December \u201clarge\u201d event was as-\nsociated with a CME, and FLUMIC contains a supplementary\n\u201cALE\u201d model to estimate worst case fluxes for such events.\nThe one-day SURF currents observed in December 2006 were\nan order of magnitude below those estimated when using the\nFLUMIC ALE spectrum, i.e., the December event represented\nonly a modest enhancement. Much larger enhancements can be\nanticipated closer to solar maximum.\nIt is worth noting that some CME-related electron enhance-\nments are associated with SPEs which can render counter-type\nelectron detectors unusable. SURF-type detectors would then\nbe invaluable as an electron monitors due to their resilience to\nproton contamination.\nThe relative currents in the three plates give information\non spectral hardness which indicates a general trend for the\nhardening of the electron spectrum during the course of the en-\nhancements. This is followed by a sudden softening at the start\nof the next event. On the peak days of the April event, the\nfolding energies of the spectra were found to lie between 0.76\nand 0.96 MeV, somewhat higher than the 0.49 MeV provided\nby the standard FLUMIC. The value of Eo on December 15\nwas 0.61 MeV, a little lower than the 0.77 MeV provided by the\nALE supplement to FLUMIC which aims to model this type of\nCME-related event.\nOf course, the period covered by our SURF measurements\nin MEO represents, as yet, only a small part of the solar\ncycle. Even so, these data provide a useful test of the available\nenvironment models and design tools. In due course, further\ndata will enable updates of DICTAT, FLUMIC, and other tools\nto be accomplished. Data on doses, ions, and proton fluxes will\nbe examined elsewhere.\nAPPENDIX A\nMAGNITUDE OF PROTON CURRENTS COMPARED\nTO ELECTRON CURRENTS\nThe following is an estimate of how solar proton events (or\nthe inner belt proton environment) can contribute to the total\ncurrent measured by the SURF instrument within Merlin. From\na charging perspective, only the net current is of importance.\nHowever, if SURF is employed as an electron monitor, the\nproton current would be seen as \u201ccontamination.\u201d Whereas a\nlarge SPE has not yet occurred during the Giove-A mission,\na small event was recorded on December 13, 2006, associated\nwith a CME.\nThis problem is approached in two stages; first, the shapes\nof various SPE spectra are used as inputs to Mulassis [25]\nto compute what fraction of incident protons are stopped in\nthe three current-measuring plates within SURF. Then, the\nnormalization parameters of the spectra are used to calculate the\nabsolute \u201cpositive currents\u201d that will cancel out some or all of\nthe electron \u201cnegative currents\u201d that SURF routinely measures.\nA. Stage 1: SPE Spectra\nFive SPE spectra are used as Mulassis inputs:\n1) SPE September 29, 1989: spectrum derived from GOES\nand ground neutron monitor data;\n2) SPE October 24, 1989: spectrum derived from GOES and\nground neutron monitor data;\n3) SPE August 4, 1972: spectral shape derived from to-\ntal fluence Weibull fit and then normalized to a peak\n(>10 MeV) flux of 106 cm\u22122s\u22121;\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

SPE spectra used as inputs to Mulassis tool. The spectra for\nSeptember 29, 1989 and October 24, 1989 are derived for the peak time of\nhigh energy protons.\nFig. 14. Schematic diagram of SURF layers in Mulassis. Green areas repre-\nsent aluminum, and white areas represent a vacuum. The top layer is spacecraft\nshielding. All layers are 0.5 mm unless otherwise labeled. Width is arbitrary as\nMulassis is a 1-D simulation tool.\n4) CREME96 worst week spectrum: 180-h average over\nseries of events in October 1989;\n5) CREME96 peak flux spectrum: peak 5-min averaged\nfluxes observed on GOES in October 1989.\nIt should be noted that the functional forms for spectra 1)\nand 2) are derived using empirical data at >100 MeV and then\nextrapolated to lower energies. As it is the protons in the energy\nrange 10\u2013100 MeV that are responsible for most of the positive\ncurrent in the plates, this extrapolation may not accurately\nrepresent the relevant part of the spectrum for the first two\ncurves in Fig. 13. As stated previously, the August 1972 SPE\nspectrum is derived by normalizing the total fluence model of\nXapsos to a (Spenvis) quoted peak integral (>10 MeV) flux of\n106 protons cm\u22122s\u22121. This corresponds to an equivalent event\nduration (at peak flux) of 5 h. The August 1972 event spectrum\ncan also be closely fitted with a simple exponential function\nwith a folding energy of \u223c30 MeV. Hence, although this event\nis soft in that it contained very few high energy protons, the\nspectral peak occurs in a regime that coincides with SURF\u2019s\nmaximum sensitivity to proton contamination.\nThe Mulassis simulations were performed with layered\ngeometry as shown in Fig. 14. An isotropic proton source was\nused in each case.\nThe fraction of incident protons deposited in each SURF\nplate was calculated by comparing proton flux tallies at the\nlower edge of each aluminum layer. The results are given in\nTable I. The equivalent figures for an exponential electron\nspectrum peaking at \u223c1 MeV are approximately 18%, 10%,\nand 9%. The percentages of Van Allen belt protons that become\ntrapped are also given for comparison.\nTABLE I\nPERCENTAGE OF INCIDENT SPE >1-MeV PROTONS THAT BECOME\nTRAPPED IN ONE OF THE THREE RESPECTIVE ALUMINUM SURF PLATES\nTABLE II\nPROTON-INDUCED SURF PLATE CURRENTS IN FEMTOAMPERES PER\nSQUARE CENTIMETER FOR DIFFERENT SPE SPECTRA\nB. Stage 2: Positive SURF Plate Currents\nHaving established the fraction of SPE protons that are\nexpected to become trapped in the current-measuring SURF\nplates, it is trivial to calculate the expected proton-induced\npositive currents that will contaminate the electron current\nmeasurements\u2014see Table II. The equivalent figures for trapped\nprotons at L = 1.62 are also given for comparison. The values\nin Table II for September 29, 1989 and October 24, 1989 rely on\nnormalizations derived from the peak in the high energy proton\nflux. The extrapolated low energy component (responsible for\nproton-induced currents) may therefore be an underestimate of\nthe peak level contamination observed in SURF.\nThis demonstrates that the technique of extrapolating SPE\nspectral functions to lower energies from high energy empirical\ndata does seem to produce results on similar orders of mag-\nnitude to other data\u2014i.e., the CREME96 worst week model,\nwhich is derived from the same time period as the October 1989\nSPE (GOES data are also used to derive this spectrum although\npossibly inclusive of lower energy bands).\nMore pertinently, this shows that the intensities of the SPEs\nare likely to produce only negligible currents within the SURF\nplates. For example, the measured SURF current in plate 1\nduring the SPE on December 13, 2006 was approximately\n1.2 pA\/cm2 (1200 fA\/cm2). If this was masking a proton\npositive current on the same order of magnitude as the\nSeptember 29, 1989 event, then the true electron current\nwould only be \u223c0.025% higher than was measured (in ac-\ntual fact, the December 2007 event was roughly an order of\nmagnitude less intense in terms of >10-MeV protons than\nSeptember 1989; therefore, the effect should be even more\nnegligible). A nominally softer event, such as that witnessed\nin August 1972, actually represents a more severe worst case\nscenario than CREME96\u2019s peak flux model for two of the three\ncurrent collecting plates; however, the currents are still low\nwhen compared to electron current enhancements during SPEs.\nThis can be contrasted with trapped radiation models (AE8\nand AP8 for electrons and protons, respectively) which, for an\nL shell value of \u223c1.6 (orbit altitude \u223c4000 km), predict flux\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The y-axis units in both cases are arbitrary and\nunimportant.\nlevels what would be expected to induce proton currents in the\nSURF plates comparable in magnitude to those listed in Table II\nfor the CREME96 peak flux case. These \u201cpositive currents\u201d are\ncalculated to be reasonably significant fractions of the negative\nelectron-induced currents at this orbit altitude: 6%, 23%, and\n23% for the top, middle, and bottom SURF plates, respectively.\nThese figures are based on equivalent Mulassis simulations us-\ning electron input spectra derived from the AE8 model. Actual\nSURF measurements from the version of the instrument that\nflew on the STRV1d satellite are up to approximately a factor\nof two higher (\u223c200 fA\/cm2 for the directly comparable top\nplate); therefore, the proton contamination in this environment\nmay in fact be lower.\nAPPENDIX B\nSPECTRAL DETERMINATION\nThe basic method is to begin with a parameterized template\nelectron spectrum, multiply this by the known response func-\ntions of the three SURF current-measuring plates, and thus\ndetermine the predicted plate currents as a function of the\ninitial parameters. Real plate current measurements may then\nbe used to obtain a best fit electron spectrum for the ambient\nenvironment.\nIn the absence of detailed spectral information, the template\nelectron spectrum should be represented by a simple function.\nPreviously, this has taken the form of exponential energy de-\npendence for the integral intensity. The differential form of this\nfunction must also follow an exponential; therefore, we have\nf(E) = Ae\u2212\nE\nE0 (B1)\nwhere f(E) has units of electrons per square centimeter per\nsecond per steradian per megaelectronvolt.\nThis template spectrum is plotted in Fig. 15 with Eo =\n1.5 MeV and an arbitrary value for the proportionality\nconstant A.\nA crucial part of this process is the accurate knowledge\nof the response function of the three current-measuring plates\ncontained within SURF. The current measured by each collect-\ning plate essentially represents a count of the environmental\nelectrons that have successfully penetrated the shielding above\nthe plate but have then dissipated all their remaining energy\nwithin the plate material and thus become trapped. Therefore,\noptimum electron energies will correspond to each plate where\nthe energy is sufficient to pass through the shielding layers but\ninsufficient to pass completely through the plate. Monoener-\ngetic isotropic electron sources were used in the DICTAT tool\nto predict charging currents in each of the three SURF plates;\nthe results are plotted in the main text.\nOnce the template spectrum f(E) has been defined and the\nplate response functions rn(E) are known, the overall plate\ncurrent measurements can be predicted using the following\nintegral:\nJn =\n\u222b\nf(E) \u00b7 rn(E) \u00b7 dE (B2)\nwhich becomes\nJn = A\n\u222b\nrn(E) \u00b7 e\u2212\nE\nE0 dE. (B3)\nIf the response functions (rn) are known in functional form,\nthen the aforementioned integrals may be solved analytically\nto give plate currents as direct functions of Eo. In the more\nrealistic case where the response functions are determined\nnumerically, the dependence of plate currents on Eo must also\nbe presented numerically.\nBy calculating two independent plate current ratios (e.g.,\nJ1\/J2 and J2\/J3), the proportionality constant (A) can be elimi-\nnated as a factor leaving two values and two E0-dependent vari-\nables to be used to determine the spectral hardness. These are(\nJ1\nJ2\n)\nm\n(\nJ2\nJ3\n)\nm\nJ1\nJ2\n(E0)\nJ2\nJ3\n(E0)\nwhich are plate 1\/plate 2 current ratio (measured), plate 2\/plate\n3 current ratio (measured), plate 1\/plate 2 current ratio (as a\nfunction of E0), and plate 2\/plate 3 current ratio (as a function\nof E0), respectively.\nBy systematically varying E0, the best fit-to-data value may\nbe determined by minimizing an appropriate statistical measure\nof the deviation of the model from the data. If empirical errors\nare well known for the measured plate current values, then\na Chi-squared minimization technique is appropriate. In the\nabsence of such errors, an alternative may be used, equivalent\nto least squares fitting in simple linear problems. As ratios are\ninvolved, it is appropriate to define the statistic in logarithmic\nterms, for example, let the minimization statistic S be defined as\nS=\n\u221a[\nln\n(\nJ1\nJ2\n)\nm\n\u2212ln\n(\nJ1\nJ2\n(E0)\n)]2\n+\n[\nln\n(\nJ2\nJ3\n)\nm\n\u2212ln\n(\nJ2\nJ3\n(E0)\n)]2\n.\n(B4)\nS then uses the logarithmic difference between model predic-\ntion and measured value for two plate current ratios, combined\nin quadrature. Finding the value of E0 that yields the lowest\npossible value of S is a viable method for determining the\nspectral hardness of the actual electron environment. Having\ndetermined the best fit to E0, the three predicted plate currents\nwill yield three different values of the proportionality constant\nA. A simple average can then be taken to find the second\nparameter of the template spectrum.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
