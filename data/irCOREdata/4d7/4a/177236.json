The initial screening with a\nsimple binding immunoassay resulted in 8 clones that were further screened using our in-vitro rat\nmonolayer bioassay for GnSAF. Initially the antibodies were screened as pooled phage forms and\nsubsequently as individual, soluble, single-chain antibody (scAbs) forms. Then, in order to improve the\nstability of the scAbs for immunopurification purposes, and to widen the range of labelled secondary\nantibodies available, these were engineered into full-length human immunoglobulins. The immunoglobulin\nwith the highest affinity for GnSAF and a previously described rat anti-GnSAF polyclonal antiserum was\nthen used to immunopurify bioactive GnSAF protein. The two purified preparations were electrophoresed\non 1-D gels and on 7 cm 2-D gels (pH 4\u20137). The candidate GnSAF protein bands and spots were then\nexcised for peptide mass mapping.\nResults: Three of the scAbs recognised GnSAF bioactivity and subsequently one clone of the purified\nscAb-derived immunoglobulin demonstrated high affinity for GnSAF bioactivity, also binding the molecule\nin such as way as to block its bioactivity. When used for repeated immunopurification cycles and then\nWestern blot, this antibody enabled the isolation of a GnSAF-bioactive protein band at around 66 kDa.\nSimilar results were achieved using the rat anti-GnSAF polyclonal antiserum. The main candidate molecules\nidentified from the immunopurified material by excision of 2-D gel protein spots was human serum\nalbumin precursor and variants.\nConclusion: This study demonstrates that the combination of bioassay and phage display technologies is\na powerful tool in the study of uncharacterised proteins that defy conventional approaches. In addition,\nwe conclude that these data support suggestions that GnSAF may be structurally related to serum albumin\nor very tightly bound to serum albumin.\nPublished: 26 September 2005\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 doi:10.1186\/1477-7827-3-49\nReceived: 12 August 2005\nAccepted: 26 September 2005\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/49\n\u00a9 2005 Sorsa-Leslie et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/49Background\nPhage display has proven to be a powerful tool for select-\ning proteins and peptides with specific binding properties\nfrom vast numbers of variants. Phage display is based on\nthe simple fact that if gene fragments encoding polypep-\ntides are fused to bacteriophage M13 coat protein genes,\nthe protein products of these fusion genes are displayed\non the surface of the filamentous phage. Studies had\nshown that functional antibody fragments can be\nexpressed in the periplasmic space of E. coli [1,2]. In the\ncase of antibodies, antibody fragments are displayed on\nthe surface with the antigen-binding domains exposed to\nthe outside environment. These phage-bearing particles\ncan be bio-panned against immobilised antigen and those\nthat bind can be eluted and used to infect a new E. coli\npopulation. This process can be repeated several times\nusing lower concentrations of antigen each time, thus\nleading to significant enrichment of high affinity antigen-\nbinding phage. The surface antibody fragments can then\nbe sub-cloned into E. coli vectors that produce soluble\nantibodies which can be manipulated in the same way as\nany other recombinant protein.\nAlthough five putative gonadotrophin surge-attenuating\nfactor (GnSAF) amino acid sequences have been pub-\nlished [3-6], they have no significant homology, were\nderived from proteins between 12\u201369 kDa in mass, and\nhave not been conclusively confirmed as GnSAF [7]. The\npurification of GnSAF using conventional chromato-\ngraphic methods has been fraught with problems, includ-\ning low concentrations of GnSAF protein in biological\nfluids despite high bioactivity, co-elution of GnSAF with\nserum albumin and the interference from large number of\nproteins in follicular fluid, serum and cell-conditioned\nmedium [6,8,9]. These difficulties have hampered\nadvances in the field. The production of specific GnSAF\nantibodies by conventional means has not been success-\nful. The rat pAb reported by [6] reflects this problem, hav-\ning good affinity for GnSAF bioactivity, but co-purifying\ninadequate amounts of protein, which are also contami-\nnated with too many other proteins, to allow the produc-\ntion of homogenous GnSAF preparations.\nSince conventional protein purification and polyclonal\nantibody strategies have failed to yield conclusive GnSAF\ncandidate molecules, a strategy of combining phage dis-\nplay with our well-established rat pituitary cell bioassay\nfor GnSAF [6,7] was developed. The rationale for this is as\nfollows: Firstly, phage display will produce a range of anti-\nbodies to proteins even in the absence of prior purifica-\ntion of the proteins. Secondly, the GnSAF bioassay can be\nas easily used to detect the absence of GnSAF bioactivity\nas its presence. Thus, the bioassay could be utilised to pick\nout phage-derived antibodies that recognised bioactive\nGnSAF. Once a GnSAF-specific antibody was identified, it\ncould be utilised in an immunopurification strategy to\nisolate the GnSAF molecule. The current study was there-\nfore devised specifically to utilise the novel combination\nof phage display and bioassay in order to attempt to iden-\ntify human ovarian GnSAF.\nThe rationale for the degree of effort that has been\ninvested into GnSAF research revolves around its potential\nrole in the negative regulation of pituitary responsiveness\nto GnRH [7]. GnSAF probably coordinates the LH signal\nwith ovarian steroidogenesis and follicular development\nand, as such, would have considerable therapeutic and\ndiagnostic potential for women and commercially impor-\ntant species.\nMethods\nGnSAF Bioactive Material and Bioassay\nGnSAF bioassay\nA critical part of this study was the GnSAF bioassay which\nwas used to test and screen phage display library products\nfor recognition of GnSAF bioactivity. However, the exact\nmethod employed to test these phage products varied\naccording the stage of the study. The basic bioassay, which\ninvolves the addition of aqueous preparations for testing\nin a dose-response-design is described below. In the rele-\nvant sections detailing the production and testing of the\nphage display library products, the different approaches\nused to generate these aqueous preparations are outlined.\nAdult female Sprague-Dawley rats (10\u201314 weeks old)\nwere maintained under a constant 12-h light: 12-h dark,\n22\u00b0C environment with ad libitum access to food and\nwater. For each cell culture, 15 rats, selected at random\nduring the estrous cycle, were killed by stunning and cer-\nvical dislocation. Dispersion and culture of the pituitary\ncells in serum-free defined medium (SFDM) was carried\nout as described [6,10]. Bioassays were carried out in\nquadruplicate wells: 200 \u00b5l of fresh SFDM was added,\ntogether with the treatments made up to 25 \u00b5l with SFDM.\nAll the culture plates contained at least 12 control wells\nreceiving SFDM only. After 24 h incubation with the test\nsubstances, the medium was collected and stored at -20\u00b0C\nfor subsequent measurement of basal FSH as an index of\ninhibin bioactivity. The wells were then treated with 0.1\n\u00b5M GnRH (Fertagyl: Intervet UK Ltd., Cambridge, UK) in\n50 \u00b5l of SFDM. In all dishes 8 wells previously exposed to\nSFDM received GnRH alone while 4 wells previously\nexposed to SFDM received 50 \u00b5l of SFDM instead of the 50\n\u00b5l of GnRH challenge. These acted as controls for the mag-\nnitude of the GnRH response. Cultures were terminated\nafter 4 h incubation by collecting the media which was\nstored at -20\u00b0C for subsequent measurement of GnRH-\ninduced LH as an index of GnSAF bioactivity (specifically\nreduced GnRH-induced LH, but not basal FSH secretion).\nThe QC hFF preparations were added to each bioassay atPage 2 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/490, 1, 5 & 25 \u00b5l\/well, in at least four wells\/dose\/separate\nculture, to act as a GnSAF quality control. Bioassays in\nwhich the QC hFF caused <30% suppression of GnRH-\ninduced LH secretion, or in which the control GnRH\nresponse constituted <50% increase in LH, were repeated\nand the data discarded. Concentrations of gonado-\ntrophins in cell-conditioned media from rat anterior pitu-\nitary cell cultures were determined using homologous rat\ntime-resolved fluoro-immunoassay (DELFIA) for (a) FSH:\nwith sensitivity and intra-assay and inter-assay C.V. values\nof 0.6 ng FSH\/ml (NIDDK-rFSH-RP-2) using NIDDK-anti-\nrFSH-S11 and 7.1% and 11.2% respectively; (b) LH: with\nsensitivity and intra-assay and inter-assay C.V. values of\n0.2 ng LH\/ml (NIDDK-rLH-RP3) using NIDDK-anti-rLH-\nS11 and 5.4% and 7.9% respectively.\nHuman follicular fluid as a source of GnSAF bioactivity\nAll protocols employing human subjects were given Joint\nEthical Committee Approval at Aberdeen and patients all\ngave informed consent. Follicular fluid (hFF) was aspi-\nrated from follicles \u226418 mm in diameter from 40 women\nundergoing routine IVF in Aberdeen and pooled and\ndesalted as previously described [8]. Subsequently, 500 \u00b5l\naliquots of the hFF pool were stored at -20\u00b0C and used as\na GnSAF bioactivity quality control (QC), producing a\n40\u201360% reduction in GnRH-induced LH at 50 \u00b5l\/well, in\nall bioassays performed as part of the present study, as\npreviously described [8].\nGranulosa\/luteal cell-conditioned medium (G\/LCM) as a source of \nGnSAF bioactivity with reduced serum protein contamination\nGranulosa\/luteal cells (G\/LC) were recovered from hFF\nobtained from women undergoing IVF and cultured as\ndescribed by [6]. In the present study 2,500 ml of G\/LC-\nconditioned medium (G\/LCM) was processed, subjected\nto Dyematrex Blue A Dye reduction of serum albumin and\ntested to confirm GnSAF bioactivity as described [6].\nPhage Display Library Use to Generate GnSAF Bioactivity-\nSpecific Antibodies\nPlasmids and bacterial strains\nThe single-chain antibody expression vector pIMS147 was\nderived from the pHELP1 vector [11-14]. This vector pro-\nduces soluble single-chain antibody (scAb) fragments\nfused via the 3' end of the variable domain with the\nhuman C\u03ba (HuC\u03ba) domain. This vector also contains six-\nhistidine tag for purification by immobilised metal ion\nchelate affinity chromatography (IMAC). The intact\nimmunoglobulin (IgG) molecules were obtained by using\nvectors VHE, VKExpress (a kind gift from A. Bradbury, Los\nAlamos USA) and pLNOH (a kind gift from L. Norder-\nhaug, Oslo Norway). The modification was made by clon-\ning the pLNOH IgG3 into VHE and adding a HindIII site.\nThe phage display of scAbs\n500 \u00b5l of glycerol stock of the Tomlinson J Library was\ninoculated into 500 ml of 2 \u00d7 TY broth supplemented\nwith 1% glucose and 100 \u00b5g ampicillin\/ml, and incu-\nbated, with shaking, at 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.4 (1\u20132 h).\nKM13 helper phage [15] was added to 50 ml of the culture\nand the mixture incubated at 37\u00b0C, without shaking, for\n30 min. Infected E. coli cells were pelleted, resuspended in\n100 ml of 2 \u00d7 TY with 0.1% glucose, 100 \u00b5g ampicillin\/ml\nand 50 \u00b5g kanamycin\/ml, and further incubated over-\nnight, with shaking, at 30\u00b0C. Phage particles were precip-\nitated with 20 ml polyethylene glycol in 2.5 M NaCl (20%\nw\/v) as described previously [16]. Immunotubes (Greiner\nLabortechnik, Gloucestershire, UK) were coated by incu-\nbation overnight at 4\u00b0C with 4 ml of crude GnSAF prepa-\nration (10 \u00b5g total protein\/ml of albumin-depleted G\/\nLCM) in PBS (Oxoid Ltd, Hampshire, UK), washed with\nPBS, and blocked with 2% skimmed milk in PBS at room\ntemperature (RT) for 2 h. Phagemid particles (approxi-\nmately 1 \u00d7 1012) were added in 4 ml of 2% skimmed milk\nin PBS, and incubated at RT for 60 min on a rotating turn-\ntable, and a further 60 min without rotation. The tubes\nwere washed 20 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween\n20 (Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd., Poole, Dorset, UK), and the\nbound phage eluted with 500 \u00b5l of trypsin-PBS (1 mg\/ml)\nfor 10 min, with rotation, at RT. Half of the eluted phage\n(0.25 ml) were infected into 1.75 ml of exponential phase\nTG1 cell culture suspension in 2 \u00d7 TY broth, plated on TYE\nagar containing 1% glucose and 100 \u00b5g ampicillin\/ml and\nincubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. 7 \u00b5l of 2 \u00d7 TY broth contain-\ning 1% glucose, 100 \u00b5g ampicillin\/ml was added to the\nplate and the bacteria scraped until loose. 50 \u00b5l of this cell\nsuspension was then used to infect 50 ml of 2 \u00d7 TY (1%\nglucose, 100 \u00b5g ampicillin\/ml), incubated, with shaking,\nat 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.4 and subsequently 1 ml of\nscraped bacteria was stored with 15% glycerol at -80\u00b0C.\nSelected phage were then rescued from the culture as\ndescribed above. Selection (bio-panning) was repeated a\nfurther three times with reducing total protein concentra-\ntions of the immobilised GnSAF (albumin-depleted, con-\ncentrated, G\/LCM) preparation (2nd and 3rd rounds 2.5 \u00b5g\ntotal protein\/ml, 4th round 1.25 \u00b5g total protein\/ml).\nAffinity selection and initial screening of anti-GnSAF antibodies\nAfter the fourth round of bio-panning, 300 individual\nclones were chosen randomly. The 10 clones with the\nhighest affinity to GnSAF, but not skimmed milk or BSA\nwere pre-selected using an affinity enzyme-linked immu-\nnosorbent assay (ELISA) and further selection was made\nby sequencing them to identify complementarity-deter-\nmining regions (CDRs). Final selection was based on the\nscAb affinity for GnSAF as determined using duplicate rat\npituitary monolayer bioassays described above. The bio-\nassay was used in the first instance to test for pooled phage\nclones and subsequently for individual clones which hadPage 3 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/49been subcloned into a soluble vector. As detailed in Fig.\n1., pooled or individual scAbs or antibodies were immo-\nbilised on dishes pre-coated with secondary antibodies\nand then hFF or G\/LCM or culture medium alone were\nadded. Antibodies or scAbs with affinity for GnSAF bioac-\ntivity removed GnSAF molecules from the medium. When\nDiagram showing the strategy to identify GnSAF-recognising scAbsFigure 1\nDiagram showing the strategy to identify GnSAF-recognising scAbs. (1) 96-well dishes were coated with secondary \nantibodies that would and would not bind the scAbs\/IgGs and then (2) incubated with candidate anti-GnSAF and control scAbs\/\nIgGs. When (3) GnSAF-containing QC hFF or G\/LCM were added, immobilised GnSAF-recognising scAbs\/IgGs bound some or \nall the GnSAF so that when the medium was (4) removed from the wells and added (5) to our rat pituitary monolayer bioassay, \nGnSAF bioactivity (6) would be reduced. Where the sequence of secondary and primary antibodies did not include the appro-\npriate coating antibody and GnSAF-recognising scAb\/IgG, GnSAF bioactivity would not be significantly reduced.Page 4 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/49this medium was then added to the GnSAF bioassay these\nGnSAF-recognising scAbs or antibodies could be detected\nby the reduction in GnSAF bioactivity as revealed by less\nmarked inhibition of GnRH-induced LH release from the\nrat pituitary cells relative to control preparations such as\nhFF incubated with medium only.\nExpression and purification of bacterial single-chain antibody \nfragments\nA single colony of TG1 cells containing the scAb vector\n(pIMS147) was grown as previously described [12] and\nthen induced with isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactosidase\n(IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mM. Induction was\nfor 4 h at 25\u00b0C, after which the periplasmic contents were\nreleased to growth media using fractionation buffer (200\nmM Tris-HCl, 20% (w\/v) sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg\nlysozyme\/ml, pH 7.5) [12]. The periplasmic fraction con-\ntaining scAb was removed and filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m\nfilter (Sartorius Ltd, Epsom, Surrey, UK).\nPurification of single-chain antibody fragments\nThe expressed scAbs were purified with Ni2+-charged fast-\nflow sepharose, IMAC (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd,\nLittle Chalfont, Bucks, UK) [14] using the hexa-histidine\ntail as a binding target. A Ni2+-charged fast-flow sepharose\nresin column was prepared according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions and 2 ml of crude periplasmic fraction\nused to re-suspend the resin. This suspension was allowed\nto bind for at least 1 h at 4\u00b0C and then passed through the\ncolumn 3\u20134 times, each time returning the suspension to\nthe same tube. The sepharose column was washed four\ntimes with 14 ml of 100 mM NaCl in PBS, four times with\n14 ml of 10 mM imidazole in PBS followed by100 mM\nNaCl in PBS, pH 7.9, then twice with 14 ml ice-cold PBS\nand allowed to settle. The column was drained and pro-\nteins eluted with 250 mM imidazole in PBS. The eluates\nwere collected and the elution step repeated a further 3\ntimes. Following dialysis against PBS to remove the imi-\ndazole, the eluates were assayed for expression product by\ncapture ELISA. The eluates were placed in a Slide-A-Lyzer\ndialysis cassette (molecular weight cut-off 10 kDa, Pierce\nand Warriner Ltd, Chester, Cheshire, UK) and dialyzed\nagainst 2 litres of PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C with constant stir-\nring, after which time the PBS was changed and dialysis\nwas continued for a further 3 h.\nELISA for determination of intact IgG produced by CHO-K1 cells\n96-well flat bottomed Immulon\u00ae 4 ELISA plates (Dynex\nTechnologies, Ashford, Middlesex, UK) were coated either\novernight at 4\u00b0C or for 1\u20132 h at RT with 100 \u00b5l of anti-\nbody against heavy chain (anti-human IgG, Sigma)\ndiluted 1:1000 in PBS. The plates were washed 3 times\nwith 200 \u00b5l of 0.05% (v\/v) Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T) and\nthen blocked for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4\u00b0C with 200 \u00b5l\nof 2% skimmed milk in PBS. After washing, as described\nabove, with PBS-T, 100 \u00b5l of the neat culture media con-\ntaining IgGs was added in duplicate to all wells. The plates\nwere incubated for 2 h at RT or 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then\nwashed 3 times with 200 \u00b5l of PBS-T. After this, the plates\nwere incubated for 1 h at RT with 100 \u00b5l of the anti-light\nchain antibody (Sigma) conjugated with horseradish per-\noxidase (HRP) diluted 1:1000 in PBS. A standard curve\nwas produced by a doubling dilution series of a known\nconcentration of purified human IgG (Sigma, 4.8 mg\/ml\nstock). Wells containing PBS alone were included as assay\nblanks. After the final incubation, the plates were washed\n5 times with 200 \u00b5l of PBS-T and then developed with 100\n\u00b5l of 0.1 mg\/ml 3,3', 5,5' tetramethylbenzidine dihydro-\nchloride (TMB\/ml) and 0.2 \u00b5l\/ml of 30% (v\/v) hydrogen\nperoxide in 0.05 mol\/l citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.0.\nWhen optimal signal intensity was obtained, the reaction\nwas stopped by the addition of 50 \u00b5l of 1 M H2SO4. The\nabsorbance at 450 nm was read and corrected for absorb-\nance at 405 nm to account for non-specific absorbance by\nthe ELISA plate on an IEMS MF plate-reader (Labsystems\nAffinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK). The plate-reader was\ncontrolled by Genesis software (version 2.20) for Win-\ndows\u2122. This ELISA was repeated using concentrated, frag-\nment-free, IgG media and a standard curve was calculated\nusing the known IgG standard to determine the concen-\ntrations of intact IgG.\nScAb-derived mammalian IgGs\nCHO-K1 cells were used to express scAb-derived antibod-\nies as intact human IgGs. The cells were grown in tissue\nculture flasks with surface area s of 10 cm2, 25 cm2 or 75\ncm2, or in 96-well plates. The cultures were maintained\nwith HAMS-F12 medium (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies\nLtd., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine,\n10% (v\/v) FCS, penicillin 100 U\/ml and streptomycin 100\n\u00b5g\/ml at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% (v\/v) CO2 incuba-\ntor. The cells were passaged when the cultures became\nconfluent (85\u201395% confluency) by splitting the cells and\nadding fresh media. CDRs from soluble expression plas-\nmids (pIMS147) for two different GnSAF-recognising\nscAbs were amplified by PCR. Two unique cloning sites:\nPstI\/BstEII for the heavy chain and SacI\/XhoI for the light\nchain were then introduced. PCR products were separately\nsub-cloned into mammalian expression vectors for heavy\nand light chains (VHExpress and VKE).\nExpression and purification of intact IgG molecules\nThe transfection of IgG vectors into cultured CHO-K1 cells\nwas performed with Lipofectamine\u2122 PLUS reagent (Gibco\nBRL, Life Technologies) according to manufacturer's\ninstructions. The cells were cultured in 6-well plates, until\n80% confluent, before proceeding to co-transfections. 16\n\u00b5g of DNA diluted in 600 \u00b5l of serum-free Optimem\nmedia (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies) per plasmid con-\nstruct (heavy and light chains) was precomplexed with 36Page 5 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/49\u00b5l of PLUS Reagent and mixed, followed by incubation at\nRT for 15 min. 24 \u00b5l of Lipofectamine Reagent was diluted\ninto 600 \u00b5l of medium (serum-free Optimem) in a second\ntube and mixed. Pre-complexed DNA was combined and\ndiluted in Lipofectamine Reagent, mixed and incubated\nfor 15 min at room temperature. Fresh serum-free Opti-\nmem media (800 \u00b5l\/well) was added to the cells while the\ncomplexes were forming. DNA-PLUS-Lipofectamine Rea-\ngent complexes were added (200 \u00b5l\/well) to each well,\nmixed into the medium gently, and incubated at 37\u00b0C at\n5% CO2. After 3 h incubation the total volume of media\nwas increased to 2 ml\/well and the serum concentration\nwas raised to 10%. After 24 h of transfection the media\nwas replaced with fresh media and incubated for a further\n3\u20134 days before collection and purification. The media,\nconfirmed to contain the intact IgG, was concentrated 10-\nfold. IgG fragments were then removed by filtration\nthrough 100 kDa filter (Centricon Plus-80 PBHK Biomax,\nAmicon, Millipore Ltd., Watford, Hertfordshire, UK), fol-\nlowed by chromatographic purification with rProtein L\u2122-\nAgarose (ACTIgen Ltd., Olso, Norway) according to man-\nufacturer's instructions. An ELISA utilising antibodies\nagainst both heavy and light chains was used to monitor\nproduction and concentration.\nDetermination of scAb\/IgG affinity for GnSAF bioactivity\n(a) Binding of GnSAF bioactivity\nTo determine whether scAbs or scAb-derived IgGs would\nbind GnSAF bioactivity, in-vitro bioactivity-binding exper-\niments were carried out as shown in Fig 1. In the case of\nthe phage form of the scFvs, 96-well flat-bottomed Immu-\nlon 4 ELISA plates were coated (duplicates) either over-\nnight at 4\u00b0C or for 2 h at RT with 200 ng of anti-M-13\nantibody\/well (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd). For solu-\nble scAb fragments in plasmid pIMS147 and for intact\nIgGs, produced by CHO-K1 cells, the plates were coated\nwith 100 \u00b5l\/well (1:1000 dilution) of goat anti-human\nkappa light chains (bound and free) antibodies (Sigma).\nWells were washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Tween\n(200 \u00b5l\/well), blocked with 2% (w\/v) skimmed milk or\n3% BSA in PBS for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4\u00b0C. The\nplates were washed with PBS-T (200 \u00b5l\/well) four times,\n10\u201350 \u00b5l per well of scAb preparation (1\u201310 \u00b5g) in PBS\nwas added and the plates were then incubated for an hour\nat 37\u00b0C or 2 h at RT. Plates were washed again four times\nwith 200 \u00b5l\/well of PBS-T and twice with PBS before incu-\nbation with GnSAF-containing and controls preparations.\nThe source for GnSAF for these bioassays was either QC\nhFF or G\/LCM with GnSAF bioactivity. The GnSAF prepa-\nration was added (250 \u00b5l\/well) to the immobilised scAbs\/\nIgGs and incubated for 2 h on a rotating platform at 37\u00b0C.\nThe fluid was recovered, duplicates combined, centrifuged\nat 20,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and the supernatant bioassayed\nat 0, 1, 5, 25 \u00b5l\/well using duplicate rat pituitary cell mon-\nolayer bioassays.\n(b) Blocking of GnSAF bioactivity\nTo determine whether scAbs or scAb-derived IgGs would\nblock the GnSAF bioactivity, in-vitro bioactivity-blocking\nexperiments were carried out as follows. A 1:1 ratio of QC\nhFF and scAb\/IgG in PBS, or 2 \u00b5g of purified IgG with 250\n\u00b5l of QC hFF, were incubated in duplicate for 2 h at 37\u00b0C\non a rotating platform. The fluid was recovered, duplicates\ncombined, centrifuged at 20,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and the\nsupernatant bioassayed at 0, 1, 5, 25 \u00b5l\/well using dupli-\ncate rat pituitary cell monolayer bioassays.\nImmobilisation of ScAbs and IgGs with immunopurification supports\nCoupling and use of scAb\/IgG with CnBr-activated sepharose 4B\nCyanogen bromide activated sepharose 4 B (Pharmacia,\nBiotech Ltd., Knowhill, Milton Keynes, UK) was swollen\nfor 15 min in 1 mM HCl (0.2 g\/sample) and washed on a\n3G sintered glass filter with the same solution (200 ml\/g\nof dry powder). The washing solution was added in sev-\neral aliquots and the supernatant was aspirated off by vac-\nuum between successive additions. The swollen gel was\nthen washed once with 5 ml of coupling buffer (0.1 M\nNaHCO3, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.3) followed by suction of the\nexcess buffer. When the beads were dry they were added to\na mixture of coupling buffer combined with scAb or IgG\n(1\u201310 \u00b5g in PBS) and rotated in an end-over-end mixer for\n1\u20132 h at RT or overnight at 4\u00b0C. The tubes were centri-\nfuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 10 min and washed 5 times with 1 ml\nof coupling buffer. The remaining active groups were\nblocked by 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0 or 0.2 M glycine,\npH 8.0 for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4\u00b0C. To remove the\nexcess of uncoupled ligand, the adsorbent was washed\nalternatively with high and low pH Sodium acetate buffer\n(0.1 M NaAc, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.0 and pH 4.0) for 5 times.\nThe coupled sepharose was stored in PBS at 4\u00b0C unless\nused immediately.\nInitially, 100 \u00b5l of coupled CnBr beads were combined\nwith 100 \u00b5l of partially purified GnSAF (2 \u00b5g of protein\nfrom albumin-depleted G\/LCM), equilibrated to pH 7.4\nand end-over-end rotated for 2 h at RT or at 4\u00b0C over-\nnight. The beads were centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 5 min and\nthe buffer was aspirated = unbound fraction. One gel vol-\nume (200 \u00b5l) of washing buffer 1 (20 mM PBS, pH 7.2)\nwas added, mixed gently and centrifuged for 5 min at 500\n\u00d7 g and eluates collected. This wash step was repeated 3\ntimes and eluates were pooled together with the unbound\nfraction. The immuno-immobilised proteins (= bound\nfraction) were eluted by one of two methods. The first\nmethod used 300 \u00b5l (3 gel volumes) of 0.1 M glycine, pH\n2.8 and neutralised immediately after centrifugation (5\nmin 500 \u00d7 g) with 120 \u00b5l 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 13. The second\nmethod used 200 \u00b5l of 2 M NaI for repeated elution steps.\nThe eluted fractions were then combined. Proteins from a\nfinal glycine elution step were not combined with the NaI-\neluted bound fractions. Both bound fractions werePage 6 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/49desalted with HiTrap desalting columns (Amersham,\nPharmacia Biotech Ltd.) or microspin G-25 (Amersham,\nPharmacia Biotech Ltd.) before proceeding to GnSAF bio-\nassay at 0, 1, 5, 25 \u00b5l\/well doses in two separate rat pitui-\ntary cell monolayer bioassays. Once the recovery of\nGnSAF bioactivity was confirmed by bioassay, this process\nwas scaled up to immobilise 120 ng of scAb-derived IgG\nand perform 15 consecutive immunopurifications of\nGnSAF from G\/LCM. The bound proteins were pooled\nbetween each immunopurification. The recovered protein\nwas double-desalted, checked for GnSAF and inhibin bio-\nactivities, freeze-dried and reconstituted in 200 \u00b5l of 2-D\nlysis buffer for gel electrophoresis.\nCoupling and use of rpAb with Dynabeads\nTwo ml of rat polyclonal anti-GnSAF antiserum [6] was\nprocessed using a 5 ml HiTrap Q column according to\nmanufacturer's instructions for the purification of rat IgG\nand the partially purified rat IgG desalted into 0.1 M PBS.\nThe IgG was coupled to 300 \u00b5l of anti-rat IgG magnetic\nDynabeads (Dynal Biotech Ltd, Bromborough, Wilts, UK)\nand then cross-linked, to enhance the stability of the\nimmobilisation. The authors had previously (unpub-\nlished observations) determined that using 2 M NaI to\nelute protein bound by immobilised antibodies enabled\nthe antibody to maintain active binding of antigen for\nbetween 10 and 15 cycles of immunopurification of G\/\nLCM, although recovery was reduced marginally with\neach successive elution. Fifteen cycles of GnSAF immu-\nnopurification were then carried out. For each cycle, a\nfresh aliquot of 500 \u00b5l of concentrated G\/LCM was incu-\nbated with the immobilised rpAb for 15 min at RT on an\norbital mixer. This was designed to ensure that the bind-\ning capacity of the immobilised rpAb was exceeded every\ntime in order to maximise the amount of GnSAF protein\nrecovered. Unbound material was removed after each\ncycle by drawing the beads to the bottom of the tube mag-\nnetically and removing the medium. The beads were then\nwashed twice with 0.2 M phosphate buffer for 3 min and\nthe bound proteins eluted by incubation with 500 \u00b5l of 2\nM NaI for 15 min at RT. The bound proteins were pooled\nand between each immunopurification the beads were\nwashed twice with 0.2 M phosphate buffer for 3 min each.\nThe recovered protein was double-desalted, checked for\nGnSAF and inhibin bioactivities, freeze-dried and recon-\nstituted in 200 \u00b5l of 2-D lysis buffer (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH\n7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 8 M Urea, 0.05 M DTT, 10% (v\/v) glyc-\nerol 5% (v\/v) NP40, 6% (w\/v) pH 3\u201310 Resolyte, BDH\nMerck Ltd., Lutterworth, Leics, UK) for gel electrophoresis.\nOther Methods\n1-D SDS-Page and Western Blots\nSDS-PAGE was performed using Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II\u2122\ngel apparatus and SDS-polyacrylamide system supplied\nby Life Technologies Ltd. After separation by SDS-PAGE,\nthe protein was electro-blotted onto a polyvinylidene flu-\noride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon\u00ae-P, Millipore Ltd.)\nor onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C extra, Amer-\nsham International plc, UK). For antibody fragments con-\ntaining the HuC\u03ba domain, HRP-conjugated goat anti-\nhuman kappa light chain (bound and free) antibodies\n(Sigma) were used and for whole IgG antibodies, either\nHRP-conjugated goat anti-human kappa light chains\n(bound and free) antibody or goat anti-human IgG\n(whole molecule) antibody with HRP conjugate (Sigma)\nwere used, as appropriate. The blots were developed using\nthe ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Phar-\nmacia biotech UK Ltd.) according to manufacturer's\ninstructions before exposing the blot onto x-ray film and\ndeveloped in a Kodak M35 X-OMAT processor (Kodak\nLtd., Liverpool, UK). The scAb-derived IgG and rpAb\nimmunopurified proteins in the bound and unbound\nfractions were separated by 1-D SDS-PAGE.\n2-D gel electrophoresis\nProteins immunopurified using the immobilised scAb-\nderived IgG and rpAb and reconstituted in lysis buffer\nwere analysed by 2-Dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D\ngels) gels using a small format gel system [17] with immo-\nbilised pH gradient (IPG) gels for the first dimension sep-\naration. The proteins were separated in the first\ndimension using 7 cm, pH 4\u20137 IPG gel strips (Amersham-\nPharmacia Biotech Ltd.). The dehydrated IPG strips were\nre-hydrated overnight in the IPG re-swelling buffer con-\ntaining the immunopurified proteins [18]. Following\ntheir re-hydration the IPG gel strips were electrophoresed\non a Multiphor II apparatus (Amersham Biotech UK Ltd.)\nas described in [19]. Proteins were located by staining\nwith colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue G250.\nMass spectroscopic peptide mass mapping\nThe protein spots and bands were excised from the gels,\nwashed, in-gel reduced, S-alkylated, and in-gel digested\nwith sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega\nMadison, WI, USA) as described elsewhere [20,21]. An\naliquot of the peptide extract produced by in-gel cleavage\nwas passed through a GELoader tip which contained a\nsmall volume of POROS R2 sorbent (PerSeptive\nBiosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) as described [21].\nThe adsorbed peptides were washed extensively and then\neluted in 0.5 \u00b5l of a saturated solution of \u03b1-cyano-4-\nhydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile\/5%\nformic acid. The mass spectra were acquired on a\nPerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF\nmass spectrometer operating in the reflectron-delayed\nextraction mode.

These controls were either wells exposed to\nSFDM alone (basal secretion) or wells exposed to SFDM +\n0.1 \u00b5M GnRH. The differences between treatment groups\nand dose-responses were assessed using two-way analysis\nof variance (ANOVA). Differences between treatments\nand controls were tested by Dunnet's Post Hoc Test and\nbetween treatments by the Bonferroni-Dunn Post Hoc\nTest. The analyses were performed using the Statview 5\nprogramme (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkley, CA, USA). All\nresults are presented as means \u00b1 SEM.\nSequence of the study\nThe methods described above were combined in the fol-\nlowing sequence: 1) production and partial purification\nof GnSAF bioactivity, 2) bio-panning of the Tomlinson\nLibrary, 3) identification of 300 clones by simple ELISA,\n3) identification of 8 GnSAF-binding clones from the orig-\ninal 300 clones by bioassay, 4) subcloning of the 8 clones\ninto soluble form, 5) selection of 3 scAbs with high affin-\nity for GnSAF by bioassay, 6) expression of the 3 scAbs as\nintact human IgGs in CHO-K1 cells, 7) selection of the\nmammalian IgG with the highest affinity for GnSAF by\nbioassay, 8) immobilisation of rpAb (6) and phage-\nderived mammalian IgG, 9) validation of phage-derived\nmammalian IgG binding and blocking of GnSAF by bio-\nassay, 10) immunopurification of GnSAF using immobi-\nlised rpAb and phage-derived mammalian IgG, 11)\nWestern blot, 1-D, 2-D and mass spectroscopic peptide\nmass mapping of immunopurified GnSAF, 12) further\ncandidate GnSAF molecules identified.\nResults\nProduction of GnSAF from granulosa\/luteal cells and \ndepletion of serum proteins\nBSA-free M199 conditioned by granulosa\/luteal cells (G\/\nLCM) contained significant quantities of GnSAF bioactiv-\nity with a dose of 25 \u00b5l\/well reducing GnRH-induced LH\nsecretion to <50% of control (p < 0.001). When serum\nalbumin was depleted using Dyematrex Blue A affinity\nchromatography, the GnSAF activity remained in the\nunbound fraction, reducing GnRH-induced LH secretion\nto as little as 38 \u00b1 3% of control (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the\nbound, serum albumin, fraction had no significant effect\non GnRH-induced LH secretion (Fig. 2a).\nSelection of anti-GnSAF phage antibodies and their \ncharacterisation\nThe enrichment of phage antibodies from the Tomlinson\nJ Library prior to affinity selection, and from each subse-\nquent bio-pannning step, was indicated by the increase in\nthe number of phage infections after each round of pan-\nning (Table I). The strategy was that selection stringency\nwas increased by lowering the amount of antigen used to\ncoat the immunotubes. After the 4th round of bio-pan-\nning, 300 individual clones were selected randomly to\nproduce single chain variable fragment (scFv)-phage par-\nticles. These were then individually analysed for their abil-\nity to specifically bind to crudely purified GnSAF\npreparation, rather than to blocking agent, by mono-\nclonal phage ELISA. The monoclonal binding ELISA was\nrepeated for 32 positive clones with highest affinity for the\nGnSAF bioactive preparations and an additional control\nof human serum as a binding target to eliminate any\ncross-reactions was added, as was the candidate GnSAF\ninternal peptide, EPQVYVHAPC [6], for hapten finding.\nSince there are large numbers of proteins in serum, the\ndegree of cross-reactivity was marked. The ELISA was\nrepeated and the ten clones showing the strongest affinity\nfor GnSAF bioactive preparations were selected to be\nsequenced and then subcloned into pIMS147 to produce\nphage-free antibodies. Sequencing resulted in 8 unique\nphage clones which were pooled and tested for recogni-\ntion of GnSAF bioactivity using our in-vitro rat monolayer\nbioassay. After sub-cloning the eight clones were induced\nto produce soluble scFv and the binding ELISA was\nrepeated. This confirmed that clones had retained their\nability to preferentially bind GnSAF but not milk or BSA.\nThese clones, when immobilised in 96-well plates,\nreduced GnSAF bioactivity in-vitro (data not shown, simi-\nlar to data in Fig. 2.).\nExpression and purification of ScAbs\nUnfortunately, precipitation of the scAbs was repeatedly\nobserved after dialysing purified scAbs against PBS over-\nnight. This could be due to aggregation or improper fold-\ning of the scAbs. To determine the concentration of scAb\nby HuC\u03ba capture ELISA, the samples were boiled for 10\nmin to avoid a possible aggregation effect before addition\nto the ELISA plate. This enabled the overall number of\nscAbs in the purified preparation, but not the amount of\nfunctional scAbs, to be determined.\nRecognition of GnSAF by scAb antibodies\nThe pooled 8 clones were investigated for the ability to\nimmunocapture GnSAF from QC hFF. The QC hFF incu-\nbated with culture medium alone, or with anti-M13 in the\nabsence of the scAbs (Fig. 2b), or with the negative control\na clone derived from phage library panned against a con-\ntrol peptide derived from a bacterial protein (V peptide,\nFig. 2e), reduced GnRH-induced LH secretion to 37 \u00b1Page 8 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/4910%, 60 \u00b1 2% and 55 \u00b1 7% of control (p < 0.001 vs con-\ntrol). After incubation with the scAb against the non-bio-\nactive, bound (rich in serum albumin), fraction of G\/LCM\nfollowing Dyematrex Blue A purification (Fig. 2c), the QC\nhFF retained its GnSAF bioactivity, reducing GnRH-\ninduced LH secretion to 48 \u00b1 7% of control, (p < 0.001 vs\ncontrol). In contrast, after incubation with the scAb\nselected against the bioactive, unbound, fraction of G\/\nLCM following Dyematrex Blue A purification (Fig 2d),\nthe QC hFF had little GnSAF activity remaining (GnRH-\ninduced LH secretion remained at 82 \u00b1 5% of control, p >\n0.05). When the clones were used to coat 96-well plates\nseparately, 6 (Fig. 3c,d,e,f,j) had no significant effect on\nthe GnSAF bioactivity seen in QC hFF (GnRH-induced LH\nsecretion reduced to 37 \u00b1 11% of control, p < 0.001, Fig.\n3a) or in QC hFF incubated in V peptide-coated wells as a\nInitial screening of pooled scAb populationsFigure 2\nInitial screening of pooled scAb populations. The Dyematrex Blue A process left GnSAF bioactivity in the unbound frac-\ntion (a) and this was used to pan the phage display library. Neither anti-M13 (closed circles) nor SFDM (open circles) affected \nGnSAF bioactivity levels in QC hFF (b). ScAbs recognising the Dyematrex Blue A bound fraction and a non-GnSAF protein (V \npeptide) also had no affinity for GnSAF bioactivity (c, e) while those recognising the unbound Dyematrex Blue A fraction signif-\nicantly reduced GnSAF bioactivity in QC hFF.

In contrast, GnSAF bioactivity\nwas almost totally removed by the scAbs 3-c4c and 3-c4b\nand greatly reduced by the scAb 2-g3 (GnRH-induced LH\nsecretion only reduced to 81 \u00b1 12%, 91 \u00b1 7% and 70 \u00b1\n10% of control respectively, Fig. 3g,h,i).\nBinding and blocking experiments with IgG forms of scAbs\nBased on the bioassay data above, full length (150 kDa)\nimmunoglobulins were produced for the scAb clones 3-\nc4c and 3-c4b which showed the greatest affinity for\nGnSAF. This was done by co-transfecting the heavy and\nlight chain vectors (containing the scAb CDR regions)\ninto mammalian cells CHO-K1. Transient transfections\nwere optimised, but the transfection efficiency was far bet-\nter for the light chain vector and therefore the overall\nintact IgG yield was relatively low. The purified IgGs were\nused for blocking and binding experiments. While the\nclone 3-c4c-derived IgG had lost its functional activity, 3-\nc4b-derived IgG significantly altered the hFF dose-\nresponse curves, demonstrating continued affinity for\nGnSAF (data not shown, dose-response changes very sim-\nilar to Fig. 3h). In bioactivity-binding experiments, GnSAF\nbioactivity was reduced 4.6-fold compared to control IgG\n(transient transfections expressing an unrelated IgG recog-\nnising the pesticide hapten atrazine) while in bioactivity-\nblocking experiments, GnSAF bioactivity was reduced 3.4-\nfold compared to control (data not shown, calculated\nfrom changes in ED50 in dose-response curves).\nImmunopurification of GnSAF bioactivity\nFollowing small-scale experiments to ensure that the\nscAb-derived IgG and rpAb continued to recognise GnSAF\nbioactivity once immobilised, all remaining stocks of\nrpAb and 3-c4b-derived IgG were immobilised and used\nto immunopurify the maximum possible quantity of\nGnSAF bioactivity. These data are shown in Figs. 4 &5. An\nextensive panel of controls were used and these estab-\nlished that elution with 2 M NaI did not interfere with\nrecovered GnSAF bioactivity (Fig. 4a). Two molar NaI\nprocessed in the same way as eluted protein also had no\neffect on GnRH-induced LH secretion (data not shown).\nThe supports used for immunopurification did not bind\nGnSAF bioactivity (Fig. 4b) or inhibin bioactivity (Fig. 4e)\nin a non-specific manner. In contrast, there was marked\nrecovery of GnSAF bioactivity (as defined by the suppres-\nsion of GnRH-induced LH secretion: Fig. 4c), but not\ninhibin bioactivity (as defined by the suppression of basal\nFSH secretion: Fig. 4f), by eluted protein recognised by the\nimmobilised rpAb and scAb-derived IgG. The recovery of\nGnSAF bioactivity in the unbound fraction (Fig 4d) was\nexpected because in each cycle of immunopurification the\nimmobilised antibodies were overloaded with GnSAF\nbioactivity to ensure maximal purification. When visual-\nised by 2-D gel electrophoresis both the scAb-derived IgG\n(Fig. 5a) and rpAb (Fig. 5c) had produced a spread of pro-\nteins between 60 and 70 kDa, pI 5.5\u20136.0, the expected\nrange for GnSAF bioactivity. Only single bands, at 74 and\n69 kDa were visualised by Coomassie blue staining of 1-\nD gels (Fig. 5b,d). Western blotting with the scAb-derived\nIgG (Fig. 5e) compared with Western blot with the sec-\nondary antibody only (Fig. 5f) demonstrated specific rec-\nognition of a unique protein band at 66 kDa (Fig. 5e, lane\n3).\nCandidate GnSAF molecules resulting from scab-derived \nIgG and rpAb immunopurification of G\/LCM\nThe 1-D gel bands and the labelled spots in 2-D gels\nshown in Fig. 5 were then subjected to mass spectroscopic\npeptide mass mapping and the principal findings are\nshown in Table II. The main candidate GnSAF molecule\nidentified was serum albumin, its precursor and variant\nforms. Once the human serum albumin peak was\nremoved from the data for the 1-D rpAb-immunopurified\nprotein, one further candidate molecule at a similar pI\nand kDa was revealed. The five spots visible in the 2-D gel\nof this material also produced positive matches with\nserum albumin precursor, two hypothetical proteins and\nother tissue-specific proteins. The keratin 10 is epidermal\nand therefore likely to have been due to contamination.\nWhile there was insufficient material to obtain positive\nidentification from the IgG-immunopurified protein, the\ntwo 2-D spots again showed positive matches with serum\nalbumin precursor and variant forms.\nDiscussion\nWe have successfully created anti-GnSAF antibodies with\nthe help of phage display technology. The antigen used\nwas partially purified GnSAF and the bio-panning was\ncombined in a novel manner with our GnSAF rat monol-\nayer bioassay as the selection step. This is an alteration to\nthe normal phage display experiment where the antigen is\npreselected prior to phage display. It has not been possible\nto obtain specific GnSAF antibodies by conventional\nmeans, because the GnSAF has not yet been definitely iso-\nlated. This is highlighted by the presence of several non-\nGnSAF antibodies in our previously described rat anti-\nGnSAF serum [6].

The increase in the number of eluted phage particles\nafter each round of panning (Table I) caused an enrich-\nment of clones recognised by the immobilised antigen\nwhich was further confirmed by increased signal of bind-\ning ELISAs for polyclonal phage preparations (data not\nshown) and recognition for GnSAF bioactivity.\nAfter purification of the scAbs some protein aggregates or\nmisfoldings were observed and this made it impossible to\naccurately quantify scAbs, also possibly reducing the\nnumber of functional scAbs in the purified preparations.\nThe same observation has previously been made with\nregard to the Tomlinson J library [22]. In order to over-\ncome this precipitation problem, the scAbs were dena-\ntured by boiling for 10 min before their addition to ELISA\nplates. However, this can only provide the overall number\nof light chains present (the secondary antibody being\nanti-HuC\u03ba), not the number of functional scAbs. When\nproducing scAb-derived IgGs there was no aggregation\nobserved and accurate quantification was carried out\nwithout boiling. The coating of plastic immunoplates\nwith antibodies relied on the immunoabsorbent nature of\nplates. There is always a chance that the 3-dimentional\nstructure of antibody might be assembled in such a man-\nner that antigen-binding site was covered or sterically hin-\ndered. When the antibody was in the phage form, an anti-\nM13 was used as coating agent before adding the scFv to\nensure that the antigen-binding site in of the scFv was left\nfree to be in contact with GnSAF in solution.\nGnSAF immunopurified from G\/LCMFigure 5\nGnSAF immunopurified from G\/LCM. Immunopurification using phage-derived antibody immobilised on protein-L agar-\nose (a,b) or rat polyclonal antibody immobilised on anti-rat IgG-coated magnetic beads (c,d) was pooled after 15 consecutive \nloading and elution cycles with 2 M NaI. Proteins detected by Coomassie blue staining of (a,c) 2-D (immunopurified protein \nonly, numbers match those in Table II) and (b, d) 1-D (Unbound = flow-through, Bound = immunopurified) gels were investi-\ngated by mass spectroscopic peptide mass mapping. Western blot of the 3-c4b-immunopurified G\/LCM (e,f) with either 3-c4b \nand secondary antibody (e) or secondary antibody only (f) show the elution of a specifically recognised 60\u201370 kDa protein \nband (arrow) by 2 M NaI, with no further protein eluted with glycine washes.Page 13 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/49There have been previous reports of panning antibody\nlibraries against \"unknown\" targets. For instance in one\nstudy, a mixture of proteins separated by 2-D gels was\nblotted onto PVDF membrane and an antibody phage dis-\nplay library was panned against individual spots. This\nprocess produced specific monoclonal antibodies against\nprotein spots of interest [23]. However, this strategy pro-\nduces antibodies against denatured proteins and they will\nnot necessarily work in biological fluids where protein is\nin its tertiary structure. In our approach on the other hand,\nthe protein target was in its native structure when selected\nby rat monolayer bioassay and thus the antibodies created\nthis way should be functional in biological environments,\nfor example in bioassays, and physiological systems.\nThe candidate GnSAF proteins identified in this study are\ninteresting in light of a recent publication [24] suggesting\nthat GnSAF is a C-terminal component of the human\nserum albumin subdomain IIIB. The main positive iden-\ntification in our study was serum albumin precursor and\nthis suggests that GnSAF could be a modified form of\nserum albumin. Clearly the major serum albumin forms\ndo not have GnSAF bioactivity since the bound fraction\nfrom the Dyematrex Blue A purification step, which con-\nsists largely of serum albumin, does not have GnSAF bio-\nactivity (Fig. 2). Some evidence of possible endocrine\neffects of serum albumin were published in the early\n1990's, including [25], although further studies suggested\nthat any biological activity depended upon the albumin\nfatty acid content rather than effects on gonadotrophin\nactions [26]. Nevertheless, the fact that our synthetic anti-\nbodies clearly recognised GnSAF bioactivity and also\nappeared to immunopurify serum albumin supports the\nsuggestion that GnSAF may be formed by post-transla-\ntional modification of serum albumin [24] or may be a\nmuch smaller molecule very tightly bound to serum albu-\nmin. What is clear however, for instance by the separation\nof GnSAF activity and the majority of serum albumin in\nbioactive preparations, is that the mature serum albumin\nmolecule does not have GnSAF bioactivity Scaling up the\nproduction of the GnSAF-recognising IgG and immunop-\nurifying a much larger quantity of GnSAF bioactivity than\nin the present study, followed by depletion of serum albu-\nmin, would be the best way of confirming or disproving\nthis possibility. Such an approach would allow the\nextensive validation studies required to confirm whether a\nspecific candidate protein is in fact GnSAF.\nAlthough most studies indicate a 60\u201370 kDa size for\nGnSAF bioactivity [7], previously published candidates\n[3-6,27] are not necessarily mutually exclusive. None of\nthe previously published GnSAF candidate sequences [3-\n6,27] have significant homology with the candidate pro-\nteins presented in Table 2. The only conclusion that can\nbe drawn from this at present is that these candidates are\npossibly not the GnSAF molecule. [4,24] present good evi-\ndence that the serum albumin IIIB domain might be\nGnSAF, particularly a 12 kDa C-terminus component,\npossibly post-translationally modified. This is supported\nby our findings of serum albumin, its precursor molecule\nand variant PRO2619 in the immunopurified GnSAF bio-\nactive G\/LCM fractions. However, the peptide mass\nmatches in our study are scattered across the serum albu-\nmin molecule and not limited to the amino acids after\n490 of the human serum albumin molecule. Clearly this\nis less supportive of the findings of [4,24] and more indic-\nTable 2: Candidate molecules identified (NCBInr) from proteins immunopurified from G\/LCM using immobilised phage-derived IgG \nand rat pAb.\nImmuno-purification Ab Spot\/band Database Protein MOWSE Score Accession Number\nPI kDa\nrpAb 1-D 66 kDa band 5.9 69.2 Serum albumin precursor 224,400 P02768\nExcl albumin peaks 9.08 86.8 SAD1 kinase 767 Q8TDC3\n2-D #1 6.0 56.8 PRO2619 372,800 11493459\n5.9 69.2 Serum albumin precursor 228,770 6013427\n#2 5.8 72.8 Solute carrier family 39, member 12 1,855 22749433\n#3 5.0 57.2 Keratin 10 6,260 88041\n#5 6.0 56.8 PRO2619 102,500 11493459\n5.9 69.2 Serum albumin precursor 78,270 6013427\n#6 6.0 56.8 PRO2619 2,067,000 11493459\n5.9 69.2 Serum albumin precursor 1,302,000 6013427\nDerived IgG 1-D 74 kDa band Insufficient protein\n2-D #4 5.9 69.2 Serum albumin precursor 2.483e+11 6013427\n#7 5.9 69.4 Hypothetical protein 6.366e+11 51476390\n5.9 69.2 Serum albumin precursor 2.276e+11 6013427Page 14 of 16\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nReproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2005, 3:49 http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/3\/1\/49ative of the serum albumin being present as a contami-\nnant or GnSAF transporter. The possible identification of\nSAD1 kinase once the serum albumin peaks had been\nexcluded from the peptide mass search of the 66 kDa\nband of rpAb-immuniopurified G\/LCM, is interesting.\nHowever, there is nothing in the limited literaure about\nthis protein to suggest that it might be GnSAF [28]. The\nsolute carrier molecule is a ion transporter involved in\nmaintaining intracellular zinc concentrations [29] and\ntherefore highly unlikely to be GnSAF. In contrast, the\nhypothetical protein matched to spot 7 appears to be\nanother variant of serum albumin precursor.\nAlthough none of the candidate GnSAF identifications\nwere conclusive, the present study has provided the gene\nsequences to allow transfection to produce antibodies\nthat recognise GnSAF bioactivity or the occupied GnSAF\ntransporter. Scaling-up the production of the scAb-derived\nIgG should be linked together with antibody-based depel-\ntion of non-GnSAF bioactive albumin to further reduce\nthe number of proteins present in bioactive fractions.\nSuch a strategy should ultimately lead to the final charac-\nterisation of this molecule.\nA key technique in the present study was the rat pituitary\ncell bioassay. The use of such bioassays in the study of\nGnSAF was extensively reviewed by [27]. The Fowler and\nDanforth groups (reviewed in [7,27]) in particular under-\ntook studies to ensure that GnSAF bioactivity as deter-\nmined by bioassay was not due to steroid hormones,\ninhibins, activin, follistatin or some endogenous pituitary\neffect. Extensive in-vivo studies of GnSAF in women by the\nMessinis group (reviewed in [7,27]) also show that GnSAF\nrequires the ovary to be present, supporting the use of G\/\nLCM in the present study The latest such data is evidence\nthat post-menopausal women have a more rapid response\nto exogenous oestradiol in terms of sensitisation of the\npituitary to GnRH than would be expected [30], confirm-\ning the effect of an ovarian compound in antagonising\nGnRH. Nevertheless, the possibility that there are multi-\nple proteins in G\/LCM that suppress GnRH-induced LH\nmust be considered. This point is unlikely, but will only\nbe disproven once GnSAF is finally identified. The use of\nG\/LCM greatly reduces the possibility of non-specific\neffects since no substrate for the production of steroid\nhormones was provided, no serum or serum albumin was\nused in the culture medium and the biological activity of\nthe material has been extensively investigated [6], with\nsimilar findings seen in other species [31].\nConclusion\nWe have used a novel strategy by utilising a rat monolayer\nbioassay in bio-panning procedure for the rapid isolation\nof recombinant antibody fragments from a na\u00efve\nsynthetic phage display library. scAbs modified to human\nIgG forms with the same block GnSAF bioactivity and\nimmobilise GnSAF from biological fluids. Furthermore,\nwe have used scAb-derived IgG to immunopurify and\nthen Western blot a band of size 66 kDa, pI 5.5\u20136.0 which\nmatches size and isoelectric behaviour suggested for\nGnSAF in most previous studies [7]. The repeated identifi-\ncation of serum albumin, precursor and variant, supports\nsuggestions that GnSAF may be a post-translationally\nmodified form of serum albumin, although not the\nmature serum albumin molecule itself. Alternatively,\nthese identifications may be due to contamination and\nalso suggests that GnSAF may be tightly bound to, and\ntransported by, serum albumin. The fact that MS finger-\nprinting showed peptide matches across the whole serum\nalbumin amino acid sequence introduces uncertainty as\nto whether GnSAF is actually part of the serum albumin\ndomin IIIB [4,24], and supports the conclusion that\nGnSAF is more likely to be a separate molecule that is\nbound by serum albumin. Finally, this study has\ndemonstrated how phage display and alternative screen-\ning strategies may be combined to improve protein iden-\ntification strategies.\nAuthors' contributions\nTSL carried out the phage and antibody panning and\ndevelopment and drafted the manuscript.\nWJH designed the phage strategy and helped draft the\nmanuscript.\nHDM helped design the study and draft the manuscript.\nPAF designed the bioassay strategy, carried out the bio-\nassays and helped draft the manuscript.\nAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Mrs M Fraser, Mrs P Cunningham, Mrs Elaine Durward \nand Ms F MacGregor for their expert technical assistance.
