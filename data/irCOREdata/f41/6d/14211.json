The first two articles\npresent case studies on the use of video in teaching and learning. Shephard et al. describe\ntheir experiences of re-purposing a back 'care video' for video streaming, and use these\nexperiences to highlight key challenges that others may face when attempting to re-purpose\na video. Blake and Scanlon use their experiences of analysing video recordings of students,\nwho were using computers to support their collaboration in solving statistical problems, to\nargue that such video analysis provides useful rich data with which to interpret and\nunderstand students' experiences.\nThe third and fourth articles address the challenging issue of assessing the costs and\nbenefits of both specific and general learning technologies. Loewenberger and Bull present\nthe results of a survey that attempted to gather information about the costs and benefits of\ncomputer-based assessment; while Nicol and Coen describe and illustrate a model that has\nbeen developed to enable evaluations of the costs and benefits of ICT.\nThe final two articles debate issues raised by an article by Lisewski and Joyce, entitled\n'Examining the five-stage e-moderating model: designed and emergent practice in the\nlearning technology profession', published in issue 11.1 of ALT-J. Tompsett and Alsop\npresent a commentary on this article and offer a reinterpretation of the research by taking\nwhat they call 'a stricter analysis' of the events described by Lisewski and Joyce. In a\nresponse to this reinterpretation Joyce and Lisewski argue that the approach taken by\nTompsett and Alsop is too narrow and runs the risk of not taking into account the whole\ncontext in which learning technology as a profession is emerging.\nWhen I read the six articles, a quote by Frank DeRuyter, an assistive technology researcher\nin America, came to my mind. In discussing methods for evaluating the success of assistive\ntechnologies he wrote:\nWhile it is reasonable to assume that each stakeholder desires a successful outcome, it is\n2\nALT-J Volume 11 Number 2\nunreasonable to assume that each stakeholder desires the same outcome. (DeRuyter,\n1995)\nPicking up on this idea, it seems to me that one theme that draws all the articles in this\nissue of ALT-J together is that of 'stakeholders' and the different views that different\nstakeholders may have on the costs, benefits, successes or failures of learning technologies.\nIn the article by Shephard et al. article the stakeholders can be seen to be the funders, the\nlecturers, the media producer, the learning technology coordinator as well as the actors and\npatients in the video. The different views and interests of all these stakeholders presented\nthe authors with a number of challenges when trying to re-purpose a video for video\nstreaming. For example, the ownership of copyright, creative and moral rights by various\nstakeholders in the video meant that the video had to be cut or re-edited in places and that\nrestrictions were placed on where the video could be accessed. These and other challenges\nlead Shephard et al. to conclude: v\nstreaming existing videos is not for the faint-hearted; a wide range of issues will be\nencountered that must either be overcome or circumvented. Deciding which of these\ntwo responses best fits each problem is probably the toughest task, and in each situation\na rigorous cost-benefit analysis will be necessary.\nIn the Blake and Scanlon article, the stakeholders can be seen to be the different members\nof the evaluation team: CAL designers, course developers and educational technologists.\nBut the use of video analysis to record detailed student behaviours introduces another\nstakeholder into the team - the student. Such an introduction is argued by Blake and\nScanlon to enable a wider consideration of the potential benefits of CAL programmes.\nIn their article, Loewenberger and Bull report two examples in which key stakeholders\ninfluenced their survey. The first example is when staff from two faculties within the\ntargeted institution resisted efforts to engage them in focus groups and interviews, which\nled to a change in methodology. The second example is that the majority of respondents in\nthe final survey were reported to be those with high levels of seniority or experience. It is\npossible to suggest that more senior and experienced people returned the questionnaire\nbecause they had a bigger stake or interest in the relative costs and benefits of computer-\nbased assessment. In both examples, stakeholders in the survey have exerted their power\nand influence in very different ways.\nNicol and Coen identify two key groups of stakeholders in their article: those tasked with\ncosts analysis and those tasked with benefits analysis. Nicol and Coen note:\nwithin institutions, those tasked with'cost analysis normally have little expertise in\nbenefits evaluation and those with benefits expertise have little costing experience, and\nthese groups rarely work together.\nThe INSIGHT cost-benefit model described by Nicol and Coen can be seen as an attempt\nto draw the two sets of expertise together. Nicol and Coen conceptualize the model as a\ndecision-support tool for senior managers in HE tasked with making investment decisions\nabout initiatives in technology-supported teaching. They also suggest that a key\nstakeholder that will benefit from the application of such a model is the higher education\nsector, which will be able to evaluate the benefits of ICT from a wider institutional\nperspective.\n3\nEditorial\nFinally, the discussion papers by Tompsett and Alsop and by Joyce and Lisewski challenge\nus to think about the learning technology community and the different views that different\nstakeholders within that community may hold. Joyce and Lisewski also suggest that some\nof these stakeholders represent 'powerful interest groups' from managerial, academic and\npolitical arenas.\nStakeholder diversity within the learning technology means that for those working within\nthat community life is never dull. Perhaps we need to understand that diversity a little\nbetter in order to ensure that future developments can start from a springboard to success\nrather than a quagmire of 'nearly made it'.\nReferences\nDeRuyter, F.
