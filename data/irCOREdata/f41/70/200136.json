The effects of 'merit pay' on motivation  \nin a public service. \n \nDavid Marsden and Ray Richardson \nLondon School of Economics and Centre for Economic Performance \n1\n \n \n \nIntroduction. \n \nPerformance related pay has been very strongly on the increase in the UK, in both the \nprivate and public sectors. In the private sector, where it has long been a feature of \nmanagerial pay, it is being extended to a much wider range of occupations. In the public \nsector too, a large variety of performance related pay systems can be discerned and, over \nthe last few years, they have been extended to practically the whole of the Civil Service. \nThere also seems to be no prospect that the present Government will back-off from \nperformance related pay. Although the extension of the new arrangements may have been \nsomewhat retarded by the 1.5% public sector pay limit in the 1992\/3 pay round and the \nprospective wage bill freeze in 1993\/4, the Government has given no public indication of \nany shift in its view that extending performance related pay is an integral part of its policy \nof improving public services. \n \nGiven this, it is only natural to ask whether the recent experiments in performance related \npay in the public sector have been successful. This, surprisingly, seems to be a question \nwhich has rarely been addressed with any seriousness, whether in the UK (Cannell and \nWood 1992, Thompson, 1992), or even in the US, where performance related pay in the \nFederal civil service has been in use for much longer (Milkovitch and Wigdor, 1991). In \nparticular, although there exist a small number of evaluations of schemes for managerial \nstaff,\n2\n we know of no evaluation study of PRP for public service non-managerial staff, for \nwhom PRP is a relatively new practice.  \n \nDespite the growing use made of a whole range of performance related schemes, their \ntrue impact remains largely a mystery. This article, a case study of the scheme introduced \ninto the Inland Revenue in 1988, is an attempt to reduce the area of mystery. The scheme \nis a fairly typical UK public sector performance pay scheme, and  conforms to many of \nthe canons of good practice as outlined by ACAS (1990). \n \nWe begin by describing the scheme, and then go on to discuss some evaluation \ndifficulties. There is more than one way in which to seek to evaluate performance related \n  \n \n2 \n \npay. Many studies have focused on schemes in organisations where output can be \nmeasured objectively. But most of the PRP schemes spreading through the public services \nrely on subjective measures based on staff appraisal of one kind or another (Milkovitch \nand Wigdor 1991). Because of the specifics of the Inland Revenue situation, we were not \nable to gauge the impact of its scheme on any objective measure of employee \nperformance. We therefore had recourse to its likely impact on employee motivation, \nwhich we assess through a variety of employee and management opinions and attitudes, \nas expressed in the more than 2,000 responses to a questionnaire we distributed. Our \nconclusion is that performance pay in the Inland Revenue is very unlikely to have \nsignificantly raised employee motivation, indeed may, on balance, have been \ndemotivating. If it did not improve employee motivation it is hard to see how the scheme \ncould have enhanced employee performance.\n3\n \n \n \nPerformance Pay \n \nPerformance Related Pay was introduced in the Inland Revenue in the 1988 Pay \nAgreement.\n4\n  This scheme, known as Performance Pay, was a form of merit pay, under \nwhich staff could be awarded either accelerated increments or 'range points', i.e. up to \nthree increments added on to the top of the incremental scale. An award rested on \njudgments about a staff member's performance made through a system of staff appraisal, \nthe version of which that was in operation at the time of the research dating from the mid-\n1980s. Under this, individual staff were annually rated on a scale of one to five, the so-\ncalled \"Box markings\". Staff getting a Box 1, the top score, received an accelerated \nincrement if they were not already at the top of their scale, and a 'range point' if they were \nat the top of the scale. Staff who got two consecutive Box 2s could also get an award, but \nonly if they were already at the top of their scale; they then moved up the equivalent of \nhalf an increment \n5\n. The main difference between the Inland Revenue scheme and similar \nones for non-managerial employees in other parts of the civil service was that it restricted \nawards to those who had obtained a Box 2 or above (see, Kessler 1993). \n \nThe size of the increment varied by grade. For the lowest grades, Typists and Revenue \nAssistants, the maximum reward for sustained outstanding performance under the scheme \nwas a pay rise of 22% for a succession of Box 1s. For the intermediate grades of Revenue \nOfficers and Revenue Executives, the corresponding increases were 20% and 15% \nrespectively, while Inspectors could earn an extra 12%. A succession of six Box 2s could \nqualify for roughly half these amounts.\n6\n  \n \n  \n \n3 \n \nThis form of reward meant that performance related pay elements were virtually \npermanent, i.e. were analogous to normal service-related increments. They could in \nprinciple be withdrawn after a period of unsatisfactory performance but this was, \napparently, almost unknown. \n \nThe appraisal system which was linked to this scheme involved a number of stages. First \nthere was an annual discussion of individual work objectives (the 'job plan') for the  \ncoming year between each member of staff and his or her immediate supervisor, the \n'Reporting Officer'. Secondly, there was supposed to be frequent review of achievements \nin relation to this job plan, which could in turn have led to the plan being revised. Finally, \nthe Reporting Officer was asked to rate the performance of the staff member at the end of \nthe year according to as many as thirteen work related criteria. These ratings, plus \nimpressions from the preceding discussions concerning the job plan, then provided a \nbasis for the overall Box marking of the member of staff.\n7\n \n \nAn important check on the whole process was provided by the \"Counter-signing Officer\" \nwho had to vet the reports of each Reporting Officer, and who might ask for justification \nof particular Box markings given. Clearly, this made it possible to achieve consistency in \nappraisal standards among Reporting Officers, but staff could also have felt that it \nenabled management to overrule the award of good Box markings for reasons that had \nnothing to do with individual performance, for example, concern at the size of the overall \nwage bill. \n \nThe 1988 Pay Agreement which introduced Performance Pay reflected the Government's \nwish to control public expenditure. It therefore set a ceiling (para 13 vi) on the total \namount which the Revenue could award each year for Performance Pay; \"it is expected \nthat if reporting and marking criteria are properly observed the cost [of Performance Pay] \nwill not exceed (nor fall substantially short of) the cost of giving 25 per cent of the staff \nin the grades covered a range increase on the spine which they are on..\". This statement \nperhaps reflects a lack of self-confidence in the principle of performance related pay but it \nis not an unusual feature of such initiatives. Cost ceilings of a similar magnitude were \napplied to a number of other Civil Service performance related pay schemes in force at \nthat time. \n \nIn the year of our study, between about 30% and 15% of staff in the grades organised by \nthe Inland Revenue Staff Federation (IRSF) were in receipt of Performance Pay, although \npercentages varied by grade: about 30% of Revenue Executives, and about 15% of \n  \n \n4 \n \nRevenue Assistants were getting it, with Inspectors and Revenue Officers in an \nintermediate position. \n \nThe design of the Inland Revenue scheme was in certain respects a considerable \nimprovement on some earlier public service schemes. Unlike that introduced in 1987 for \nthe 90,000 scientific and professional civil servants represented by the IPMS, for \nexample, the Inland Revenue scheme had firm criteria for making awards, and was based \non 'open reporting', with agreed work targets and staff being told the result of their \nappraisals (Kessler 1990). \n \n \nSome evaluation issues. \n \nIn this study we are treating the new payment system as a management initiative and \nasking whether it was a success from management's point of view. The straightforward \napproach would therefore be to establish management's objectives for the scheme and \nthen see whether these were realised. Unfortunately, management's objectives are not \neasily established. Indeed, it is far from certain that the Inland Revenue management \nthemselves were enthusiastic about Performance Pay when it was introduced. It might \nwell be the case that the drive to have performance related pay came much more from the \nTreasury or some other part of the centre. Certainly there were no objectives in the 1988 \nPay Agreement itself which were explicitly tied to Performance Pay.  \n \nThe very title of the scheme, however, means that management must have been hoping to \nuse pay as an incentive to raise performance in some way. The logic of the scheme further \nimplies that the performance in question must have been reflected in the appraisal \nprocess, for it was this which determined the making of awards.\n8\n  There is a difficulty \nhere in that there were no fewer than thirteen work related elements referred to in the \nappraisal, not all of which were relevant to all employees and each of which may have \nhad a different weight for the different grades. There is no source of objective evidence, \ncertainly not one available to us, that would allow any monitoring of behaviour with \nrespect to these thirteen elements. It was therefore not possible for us to evaluate the \nscheme by examining employee behaviour directly. \n \nIt was possible, however, to follow an indirect route. It would be very widely agreed that, \nfrom a management perspective, introducing any scheme of performance related pay \nmakes little sense unless it motivates staff to work better in some respect or other. It is \nimplausible, for example, that its objective would be simply to reward past performance, \n  \n \n5 \n \nunless this were also thought to encourage better performance in the future. The central \njustification for performance related pay must surely be that it somehow acts as a \nmotivator. \n \nBetter motivation does not automatically translate into better performance. Revenue staff \nmight be highly motivated but still perform badly because of a range of impediments, e.g. \npoor management, inadequate training or obsolete equipment. Motivation, then, is \nsomething that can lead to better performance, but only when other conditions are met. \nWe treat it as a willingness or preparedness to do something, which means that it is a state \nof mind. Sometimes, researchers make inferences about levels of motivation purely by \nobserving performance. This can be legitimate but, equally, can lead to difficulties when \nother things are changing at the same time and are independently affecting performance. \nWe have chosen a different approach and have sought to measure possible changes in \nmotivation from the responses of staff to a variety of statements about themselves and \ntheir fellow employees.  \n \nThe second problem is motivation to do what? Given the detail in the appraisal process it \nwas felt appropriate to ask staff about most of the thirteen aspects of performance \nincluded there. Some of these aspects were seen to be more important than others. \nDiscussions with a variety of people in the IRSF and the Revenue led us to the view that \nthe two most important dimensions of performance for appraisal purposes were very \nwidely thought to be the quantity and the quality of the work done, but we explored a \nnumber of the others too. We also looked for motivational change with respect to some \naspects of performance not specifically located in the appraisal form.  \n \nWe have therefore not sought directly to connect the new payment system to changes in \nemployee behaviour. We have instead tried to establish whether Performance Pay \nchanged staff motivation, as measured by the opinions and beliefs of the staff involved. \nThese, of course, are not objective data but it is our judgment that they give a reliable \nindication of at least some of the motivational impact of the scheme.  \n \n \nData collection \n \nOur work was initially stimulated by an approach from the IRSF.\n9\n  A draft questionnaire \nwas piloted on, and small group discussions were held with, about 40 Revenue staff at \none of their offices. In the summer of 1991 the questionnaire was sent to 4,000 Revenue \nstaff in the grades represented by the IRSF. The returns were anonymous and \n  \n \n6 \n \nconfidential, and were returned in sealed envelopes via the Revenue's internal postal \nsystem but addressed to us at the LSE. All the returned questionnaires that reached us did \nso in unopened envelopes and there is no reason to believe that the replies were \ninfluenced by the possibility of favourable or unfavourable judgments from either \nmanagement or the IRSF. \n \nOf the 4,000 questionnaires sent out, 2,423 usable questionnaires were returned, giving a \nsample response rate of slightly above 60%. This is a very satisfactory response rate, \nespecially as it was not practical to send out reminders, and it may well reflect the interest \nwhich staff had in the issues being explored. Two sampling decisions were made prior to \ndrawing the sample. First, the survey was confined to staff in the two largest sections of \nthe Revenue, Taxes and Collection; the remaining sections are relatively small, which is \nwhy they were omitted from the survey, but in what follows their omission could \nconceivably be important. It must be noted, however, that our results very strongly \nsuggest that staff views on the impact of Performance Pay are not different as between \nTaxes and Collection. We therefore feel more confident that the omission of the other \nSections does not lead to any significant overall distortion. The second sampling decision \nwas to sample the different job grades disproportionately, taking a higher fraction of staff \nin the smaller grades. This was done in order to maximise the chance of obtaining \nstatistically significant results with respect to job grade within our overall sample size. It \nalso turned out that response rate to the survey varied by job grade, with higher response \nrates coming from more senior staff. In order to obtain a representative picture of all staff \nin the population, therefore, the results were subsequently re-weighted to compensate \nboth for the oversampling and for the differential response rates. All the results reported \nbelow use the re-weighted data. \n \nOverall, the sample provides a good fit of the population values according to a number of \ncharacteristics of the Revenue's staff that could be checked independently (grade, gender, \nlength of service, region and section). Also, and most importantly, there seems to be a \ngood fit by Box marking, which suggests that the staff who replied had neither done \nparticularly well nor particularly badly in comparison with staff as a whole. There seems \nto be no reason to doubt the representativeness of our data, whether by employment \ncharacteristics or by experience of the Performance Pay mechanics. \n \nIt is perhaps necessary to justify further our use of attitudes and opinions, and our \nconcentration on the inherent characteristics of the scheme rather than its organisational \nand managerial context. Our survey recorded employee opinions and attitudes concerning \ntheir experience of PRP after the scheme had been in operation for two years. They had \n  \n \n7 \n \ntherefore had long enough to become acquainted with it, and to have formed reasoned \njudgments about it. Although only a 'snapshot', our wide sample, pilot discussions, and \ninterviews with senior management and IRSF staff gave no reason to believe that the \nviews reported had been unduly influenced by external events, or that they might change \nradically without a change in the system.  \n \nAn alternative method would have been to use a 'before' and 'after' study of motivation. \nThis was not possible for us, because it would have had to start before implementation of \nthe 1988 agreement. In any case, one cannot sensibly ask employees' detailed views of a \nparticular scheme's effects on their own motivation before they have experienced it. \nInstead, we chose to infer the effects of PRP upon motivation from employees' judgments \nof their personal experience, and those of their reporting officers. \n \nIt would undoubtedly have been interesting to gather data also on objective measures of \nperformance. But these were not available, and, certainly for many aspects on the \nappraisal forms, even the Inland Revenue did not keep them. We therefore confine our \nstudy to the first link in the chain between PRP and performance, namely, whether it \nincreased employees' willingness to provide better performance. \n \nThe political and managerial contexts in which an agreement or a pay scheme are \nintroduced may sometimes be important influences on how they work in practice. A \nunilaterally imposed suspension of long-accepted comparability or consensus could make \nworkers resent a new scheme, and so see it as unfair, irrespective of its inherent merits. \nKessler (1990) argued that the IPMS PRP scheme had been introduced in 'piecemeal and \n\"half-hearted\" way' because of union opposition, and that this was the reason for its poor \nresults. We believe that such factors, although not entirely absent, were less important in \ndetermining the outcome at the Inland Revenue. \n \nFirst, although the IRSF negotiators were told that unless they accepted PRP there would \nbe no pay agreement, there is nothing unusual in negotiations for one or other side to \nissue such warnings. Indeed, the union's policy was to accept the scheme and work for its \nimprovement. Secondly, despite union reservations, the scheme was more coherent and \ncloser to the standard of best practice recommended by ACAS (1990) than the IPMS one. \nThirdly, the results of our own survey showed that a clear majority of the staff agreed \nwith the principle of PRP, and so presumably saw little reason to oppose it. There \nremains the budgetary constraint which led management to adopt a quota on payments, \nbut such pressures are a normal part of any pay r\u00e9gime. It seems, therefore, that the \n  \n \n8 \n \npolitics of its introduction did not greatly distort the working of the scheme at the Inland \nRevenue. \n \n \nWhat do Revenue staff think about the principle of Performance Pay? \n \nSome workers are suspicious of, or hostile to, the principle of relating some part of their \npay to performance. Others see nothing wrong with it or are actively in favour. Our first \ntask was to gauge the views of the Revenue staff on this issue of principle. Table 1 \nhighlights some of our results.\n10\n \n \n \nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \n \nThese results are not far out of line with those in the Next Steps report, which reported \nthat 70% of Civil Servants supported the general principle of rewarding good \nperformance with better pay (Next Steps, para 17). Revenue staff look to be somewhat \nless favourably inclined than this but, on balance, were clearly in favour of the principle \nof some link between pay and performance. As is documented below, however, many of \nthem had deep reservations about the operation of these links in the Revenue scheme. It \nmay well be that these reservations caused some people to be more hostile to the principle \nthan they would have been if the operation of the Revenue scheme was seen to be more \nsatisfactory. This interpretation is supported by the different response to the first two \nstatements in Table 1. The second statement effectively asks respondents to take both \nprinciple and practice into account, and generates less support for Performance Pay. \n \nIt is also worth emphasising that a significant minority of Revenue staff had very strong \nobjections to the principle of performance related pay. Those who expressed strong \ndisagreement with the principle of Performance Pay in the above statements were always \nmore numerous than those who expressed strong agreement. \n  \n \n9 \n \n \nOur first conclusion is that a majority of Revenue staff supported the principle of \nPerformance Pay but that a significant minority felt very hostile to it. \n \n \nDid Performance Pay motivate staff at the Inland Revenue? \n \nIn seeking to establish how people felt the scheme had changed their motivation to \nperform at work, the relevant section of the questionnaire started with the following \npreamble: Now we would like to know how the existence of the Performance Pay \narrangements have affected you personally. There followed a set of sixteen statements \nwhich the respondent was asked to comment on. The sixteen reflected the content of the \nappraisal form plus a few other possible forms of behaviour. A typical statement was as \nfollows: the existence of Performance Pay has made me willing to increase the quantity of \nthe work I do. Table 2 provides a summary of the overall responses to some of the \nstatements. \n \n \nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \n \nWe also asked a general question about whether people thought that Performance Pay had \nsignificantly raised their motivation at work. 12% said that it had, while 76% said that it \nhad not. \n \nIt is clear from these results that, on their own assessment, relatively few Inland Revenue \nstaff members felt that Performance Pay had provided them with an incentive, or a \nmotivation, to change their behaviour at work at all significantly. The results are \nespecially disappointing for the crucial areas of motivating staff to improve the quality \nand quantity of their work, with fewer than 15% perceiving any positive change. It is also \nnotable that staff felt that Performance Pay had had a negligible effect in motivating them \nto become more effective in their dealings with the public, with only 9% seeing a change. \nThis last result is potentially of importance because of the Government's hopes laid out in \nthe Citizens' Charter. \n \nNot all groups of staff had quite the same reactions to Performance Pay. It was easy for us \nto look at the differential responses by sex, grade, length of service and whether the staff \nmember had received a Performance Pay award. The overall picture is that although, on \n  \n \n10 \n \nour measures, Performance Pay did have some differential motivational effects amongst \ngroups, in no case was there a profound positive effect. Those who were most strongly \naffected in a positive direction were the most junior grades, and those with the shortest \nservice. However, even among these groups, the majority of staff replied that there had \nbeen no motivational effect to most of the questions. Among the more senior grades and \nthe longer serving staff, the effects on motivation were generally the weakest, and the \nreports of jealousy and lower morale associated with Performance Pay were the most \nfrequent.\n11\n \n \nIt is possible that individuals are not always the best judges of their own behaviour, or \nindeed of their motivation. An alternative source of evidence is the judgement of those \nInland Revenue staff who have to carry out staff appraisals, i.e. the Reporting Officers. \nWe asked these, about 20% of our total sample, to respond to a number of statements on \nhow they thought Performance Pay had affected staff. The results are highlighted in Table \n3. \n \nTABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \n \nThese results certainly give no comfort to those who feel that staff might understate the \nextent of positive motivational change. They fully confirm the earlier findings that \nPerformance Pay had a very limited effect on positively motivating Inland Revenue staff. \nIndeed, the Reporting Officers were, if anything, even more sceptical of the system's \nsuccess in this respect. Only on the impact of Performance Pay on the quantity of work \ndone were Reporting Officers more sanguine than staff as a whole, and even there the \ndifference was unimpressive. \n \nSo far we have been looking for the existence of positive motivational effects. There \nmust, however, be the possibility that at least some Revenue staff found the new \narrangements to be actually demotivating. This might have happened because some \nthought the whole principle unfair or because they felt, rightly or wrongly, that they had \nbeen cheated out of an award to which they were entitled. One pointer in this direction is \nthe element of strong disagreement with the principle of Performance Pay, noted above in \nthe discussion of Table 1. Another might be inferred from the detailed results lying \nbehind that Table. If someone disagrees with a statement that Performance Pay has had a \npositive motivational effect, he or she might believe either that it has no effect at all or \nthat it has a negative, demotivating one. Those who just express disagreement might feel \nthat it has had no effect. Those who express strong disagreement may well be indicating \n  \n \n11 \n \nthe stronger, negative effect of demotivation. It is notable that for many of the statements \nin Table 1, the number of people who expressed strong disagreement exceeded the total \nof those who expressed any measure of agreement at all. We would not wish to push this \ninferential line of reasoning too far but neither do we think that it is entirely without \nforce. \n \nThe likelihood of an element of demotivation is also indicated by the responses to some \nof the statements elsewhere in the questionnaire where we asked staff to respond to a \nseries of statements about the effect of Performance Pay not on themselves but on staff as \na whole. Some highlights are given in Table 4. \n \n \nTABLE 4 ABOUT HERE \n \n \nWith a majority agreeing that the scheme had undermined morale or caused jealousies \nbetween staff, and a quarter agreeing that Performance Pay had made staff less willing to \nassist one another, the likelihood of some element of counter-productive demotivation is \nevident.  \n \nOur overall conclusion is that the positive motivational effects of Performance Pay, as it \nwas practised up to the time of our research, were at most very modest. It is hard to see \nthat they had been felt to any degree by more than a small minority of staff. Further, the \nnumber who felt motivated to a powerful degree, as shown by the number who expressed \nstrong agreement with any of the relevant statements, was always negligible. Even worse, \nthere is clear evidence of some demotivaton. Although we cannot be sure of this, it would \nbe very easy to conclude that the net motivational effect was, although small, actually \nnegative. \n \n \nWhat explains the motivational impact of Performance Pay? \n \nThere are many strands in the academic literature purporting to explain motivation and \nemployee performance, or the lack of it. Our data allow us to use two of these strands to \nshed light on why Performance Pay in the Revenue seems to have had such a \ndisappointing motivational impact. \n \n  \n \n12 \n \nOne strand, expectancy theory (see, e.g. Lawler, 1971), stresses the importance of a series \nof links between behaviour and the rewards accruing to that behaviour. For there to a be a \nheightened motivation to perform, someone:-  \n(a) has to feel able to change his or her behaviour,  \n(b) has to feel confident that a change in the behaviour will reliably produce the \nrewards, and  \n(c) has to value the rewards sufficiently to justify the change in behaviour.  \nOur results suggest that these three conditions are not all met for a large number of \nRevenue staff. Expectancy theory would therefore point to only modest motivational \nimprovement, or to demotivation. \n \nDid staff feel they could change their behaviour? We asked whether individuals felt \ncapable of doing what was necessary to get an overall Box 1 or 2 marking in the future. \nThis, it will be recalled, was a necessary condition for a Performance Pay award to be \nmade. Only 6% felt that they were not capable of such a performance level, as against \n81% who believed that they were. The first condition of expectancy theory was, therefore, \nclearly met.  \n \nWere staff confident that a change in behaviour would reliably produce the rewards?  No \nfewer than 45% of our respondents were of the view that, even if their performance were \ngood enough to merit a Box 1 or 2, it was doubtful that such a grading would be given; \nonly 40% believed that a good enough performance would produce the correct Box \nMarking. This belief, whether justified or not, substantially reduces staff motivation to \nchange their behaviour, and suggests a potent source of disillusion.  \n \nDid staff value the rewards sufficiently? Obviously, most staff want the money that an \naward would bring. The key question is whether the amounts available justify, in their \nminds, the extra effort involved. Only 17% of our respondents felt that the financial \nreward from Performance Pay was a sufficient inducement for them to change their \nbehaviour; 71% felt that it was insufficient. \n \nThus, two of expectancy theory's three conditions were not met for the Revenue's system \nof Performance Pay, which provides a strong reason for its failure to motivate staff. Other \nfindings from the survey re-inforce this conclusion and point to possible reforms that \nshould be contemplated if motivational change is to be secured. Perhaps the single most \nimportant issue is not so much the amount of money involved but the way it is allocated \nvia the appraisal system. \n \n  \n \n13 \n \nWe asked a number of questions about the appraisal system in the Revenue. Table 5 \nhighlights some results. There is a consistency of response between these answers and \nthose referring to individual feelings as to whether they would get the Box marking they \nfelt they deserved if they were produce the appropriate performance. There was a \nwidespread doubt about the fairness of the appraisal system. Worse, there was manifestly \na view that the system of Performance Pay had undermined the integrity of the long-\nstanding and well-established appraisal system. As was noted above, the mechanics of \nPerformance Pay were bolted on to the existing appraisal system. It is clear that very \nmany staff felt that the appraisal system had been abused and that they were less likely to \nget the appropriate Box marking.  \n \n \nTABLE 5 ABOUT HERE \n \n \nThis belief is very likely to have been reinforced by the fact that the frequency of Box 1 \nand 2s had fallen after 1988, for all grades. As an example, the proportion of staff on the \nInspector (S) grade who were given a Box 1 fell from 12% in 1988 to only 5% in 1991; \nthe corresponding figures for Box 2s were 63% and 43%.\n12\n  The reasons for these \ndeclines are not obvious but it seems extremely unlikely that they reflect a widespread \ndeterioration in staff performance. It is true that Revenue staff had previously been paid \nsomewhat more than comparable Civil Servants for a number of years; it is also true that \nCivil Service staff outside the Revenue seem often to qualify more easily for Performance \nPay Awards, reflecting perhaps the different rules on performance related pay in their \nparticular pay agreements. It is possible that the Revenue used its system of Performance \nPay in part to deny high Box markings and control its wage bill more aggressively than \nother Civil Service employers.  \n \nIf this was so it must have been all the more damaging given the psychological \nimportance staff attribute to their Box marking. 63% of our respondents agreed that the \npersonal satisfaction they derived from work was a sufficient incentive for them to do \nwhat was necessary to get a Box 1 or 2; only 26% disagreed. The right Box marking was \nfor many a highly important signal, confirming them in their self-esteem and in their \nbelief that they were doing their work to the right level. For this to be jeopardised by a \nparticular method of awarding performance related pay is potentially serious for \nmanagement. \n \n  \n \n14 \n \nWe are not claiming that the appraisal system necessarily was unfair, did operate a quota \nor was characterised by undue overruling from above. Our information does not permit us \nto make an authoritative judgment on these issues. But for staff motivation, what is \nimportant is what employees think, and their thoughts were heavily in a negative, cynical \ndirection. \n \nIt is interesting that some of these worries find an echo in the section of the questionnaire \nwhich was answered only by Reporting Officers, i.e. those who carry out staff appraisals. \nTable 6 gives some results. Reporting Officers saw the need for review by their superiors \nin order to secure consistency between Officers. However, they were also uneasy at the \nextent of overruling; they felt that more than mere consistency was involved here. There \nwas also a recognition that the new financial link raised problems; fully 33% expressed \nstrong agreement with this viewpoint, which implies that the increased difficulties were \nby no means trivial for the Officers concerned. \n \n \nTABLE 6 ABOUT HERE \n \n \nOur conclusion on this point is that the links between the appraisal system and the \nRevenue's system of Performance Pay in practice seem, to a degree, to have alienated \nmany staff. They may well have helped to degrade a system which, for other purposes, \nwas entirely suitable. Further, the scepticism which staff were acquiring about the \nintegrity of the appraisal system provides an explanation for the very limited motivational \nimprovement that Performance Pay induced. \n \nExpectancy theory provides one framework to assist in understanding why the positive \nmotivational response to performance related pay in the Revenue was so muted. A second \nframework is given by Goal Setting Theory, which stresses the  virtues of managements \nsetting clear, acceptable and achievable work goals (see, for example, Latham and Locke, \n1991). Table 7 sets out some of our results. \n \n \nTABLE 7 ABOUT HERE \n \n \nThese are rather mixed results. Goal setting theory predicts improved performance if \ngoals are set more clearly, as long as the goals are agreed and believed to be achievable. \n  \n \n15 \n \nThe responses to the first statement in Table 7 suggest only a modest improvement in this \nrespect; those to the second statement suggest a more widespread improvement. Those to \nthe other two statements, however, strongly imply no change. Goals may have become \nclearer but the vast majority of workers felt that they were already working to the \nappropriate standard. This may or not be true in objective terms but even if it is not true, \nour results strongly imply that management had not been able to convince their staff to \nthe contrary. Without a commitment to new and more appropriate goals, goal setting \ntheory would suggest a zero or very modest impact. \n \nReplies to two further questions support this conclusion. 31% of staff believed that the \nvery nature of their job made it hard for them ever to be awarded a Box 1 or 2. In \naddition, no fewer than 46% of the Reporting Officers agreed that staff had insufficent \ncontrol over their work to make performance related pay a sensible idea.  \n \n \nConclusions and Policy Implications. \n \nOur findings in this paper are based on the views of a large and representative survey of \nInland Revenue staff. To our knowledge, it is the first study of performance related pay of \nits kind for public sector white collar workers in the UK. For this reason alone, it deserves \nto be taken seriously. It is given added importance by the Government's declared intention \nof making performance related pay a more important feature of public sector pay \narrangements in the future. \n \nAlthough the principle of relating pay to performance was widely accepted among \nRevenue staff, our results strongly suggest that the system as it operated had, at most, \nonly a small positive motivational effect on staff. The small effect was found both in staff \nreplies on general motivation, and from detailed questions relating to aspects of work that \nwere assessed in the appraisal system. Moreover, the small motivational effect was \nrecorded both in the replies of individual members of staff and in the judgments of \nReporting Officers concerning the behaviour of staff. Finally, these small improvements \nhave to be set against certain changes in the other direction. The net effect on staff \nmotivation could well have been negative. If motivation was not improved at all \nsignificantly, or deteriorated, it is hard to see why performance should have been changed \nfor the better.\n13\n \n \nWhy should Performance Pay have had so little general effect on motivation when 57% \nthe staff reported being favour of the principle? First, and most importantly, it was widely \n  \n \n16 \n \njudged to be unfair in its operation. Many staff believed that there was a quota applied to \nthe Box markings awarded, and that even if their work performance was good enough, \nthey would not be awarded an appropriate Box marking. Indeed, among the latter, 80% \nbelieved that there was a quota in operation on Box markings. About a third of the staff \nalso believed that favouritism influenced Box markings. Objective evidence to support \nstaff views on this matter is provided by the fall in the number of Box 1 and 2 markings \nbeing awarded in the first few years of the new scheme's operation. In this context, it is \nnot surprising that staff perceived that the appraisal system had been twisted for purposes \nthat had nothing to do with actual performance. \n \nAnother cause cited for the feeling of unfairness of operation was that the Box marking \ntook insufficient account of job allocations, i.e. of the detailed tasks that different staff \nwere required to do. Further, about a third thought that their job gave them little \nopportunity to achieve a Box 1 or 2. The latter view was given support by the replies of \nReporting Officers. \n \nIt might be claimed that, in spite of these findings, Performance Pay had nevertheless \nbeen a success from management's viewpoint. True, only a small fraction of the staff \nseem to have been stimulated to perform better, but the cost of Performance Pay in terms \nof the fraction of the overall pay bill paid out was also fairly small. In net financial terms, \nit might have 'worked'. This may be correct, and certainly we do not have the data to \ndisprove it.  However, one should also consider possible hidden costs in terms of loss of \nmotivation elsewhere, and in the damage to established management systems. Three main \npotential costs stand out: possible damage to the work atmosphere; reduced staff \nconfidence in the reporting system; and reduced motivation among more senior and \nlonger service staff. \n \nMany of our respondents said that Performance Pay caused some deterioration in the \natmosphere at work, producing a degree of staff jealousies and a decline in morale. \nErosion of staff confidence in the reporting system is attested by the widespread belief \nthat a quota was in operation of Box markings so that no matter how well people worked, \nmany would not be given a Performance Pay award. As the reporting system had other \nimportant uses, including clarifying staff's work objectives, and as high Box markings \nbrought intrinsic rewards, its discredit among the staff could have been quite serious in \nthe longer run. Finally, as was noted above, longer service staff and those in higher grades \nwere more likely than junior staff to indicate 'strong disagreement' with questions on the \nmotivational impact of Performance Pay. Although our questions on motivation mainly \nasked whether Performance Pay had increased motivation, and strictly speaking even a \n  \n \n17 \n \nstrong \"no\" answer does not imply actual loss of motivation, the possibility seems quite \nserious. \n \nOur results therefore suggest that the system required significant modification if it was to \nrealise the full potential of a number of positive features it had in the eyes of staff. Many \naccepted its principle; it led to greater clarity in setting job targets for some staff; and it \ndid succeed in motivating at least a minority. Our study indicated that what management \nneeded to do in addition was to find some way of overcoming its perceived unfairness of \noperation among staff and to increase the amount of money involved. Both defects \nneeded to be tackled simultaneously, as merely increasing the amount of money at stake \ncould easily intensify feelings of unfairness. In fact, the scheme was modified very \nsubstantially in October 1992, after our research was carried out.  \n \nThe Inland Revenue has now adopted a form of Performance Management which \ninvolves, inter alia, a new pay structure and grading scheme, and a new process of setting \nannual work targets (where possible of a quantitative form) each year with the individual \nmember of staff. At the end of the year a judgment is made by the supervisor as to \nwhether the member has met, exceeded or not met the agreed targets. In the 1993 wage \nround, staff members who were judged not to have met their targets received only the \nbasic 1.5% increase in pay; those who met their targets got between 2.2% and 10%, \ndepending on where they were in the new pay structure; those who exceeded their targets \ngot even more, at least 2.7%. In the event, over 90% of staff were judged to have met \ntheir targets. On the basis of the first year's experience, therefore, any performance related \npay quota would seem to be a thing of the past, and the sense of unfairness surrounding \nthe system of relating pay to performance could, consequently, have been diminished. On \nthe other hand, if more than 90% of staff get the standard performance payment, its \nincentive effect must also become diminished by being seen as close to automatic.  \n \nThe new scheme's first year of operation might not be typical, however. There is, for \nexample, already more than a suggestion that staff members' targets were ratcheted up at \nthe end of the first year, implying that staff might well have to work progressively harder \nto earn any performance element in year two. The implication is that the scheme is \nevidently still evolving, and will repay further evaluation in the near future.  \n  \n \n18 \n \nEndnotes. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  We would like to thank the IRSF for financial assistance in carrying out the research \nreported here, and Clive Brooke, Lorraine Denoris and Jim McAuslan of the IRSF for \ntheir guidance, time and patience. We also wish to thank the Inland Revenue management \nfor their advice, and help in conducting the survey. They are in no way implicated in what \nfollows. \n \n2. Recent evaluations of managerial staff in the UK include Bevan and Thompson (1992) \non local authority managers (but with a view primarily to equal opportunities), and \nstudies in Australia reviewed by Wood (1991), the US (Milkovitch and Wigdor 1991), \nand across a wider range of countries (Wood and Maguire 1993). \n \n3. For a fuller version of the survey results, and details of the questionnaire, see Marsden \nand Richardson (1992). \n \n4. More precisely, the 1988 Agreement led to its introduction for the staff grades covered \nin our analysis; these refer to virtually all the Revenue staff but exclude the most senior \nstaff.  \n \n5. Under the agreement with the IRSF, there were in fact two pay spines, A and B, which \nwere staggered, so that the equivalent of a half increment in some other pay systems was \nachieved by movement to the next highest point of the other spine. Thus Box 1s were \nrewarded with a linear upward progression along their current pay spine, whereas Box 2s \nprogressed by zig-zagging between the two spines. \n \n6. Over time, staff could combine performance awards for Box 1s and two consecutive \nBox 2s, but could not obtain more than three awards on each criterion, subject to the \nmaximum additional reward under Performance Pay of three range points up the spine \ncontaining the member of staff's scale maximum. \n \n7. Even then, Reporting Officers were not required to give an overall Box marking that \nwas a simple average of the individual elements. Not only could certain elements be \ngiven a higher weight than others, additional factors could be taken into account. \n \n  \n \n19 \n \n                                                                                                                                           \n8. It is also in principle possible that an award could have made the difference between \nsomeone staying in the Revenue and leaving -- this was not something we were able to \nexplore. \n \n9. We subsequently approached the Inland Revenue official side to ask whether they \nwished to make it a jointly sponsored union-management study. The official side chose \nnot to participate, but they did provide a great deal of valuable help with background \ninformation, and they cooperated fully with the research. In particular, they agreed to \ndraw the sample to our specifications from their personnel records, and they distributed \nthe questionnaires through their internal mailing service. The authors would like to \nexpress their very sincere thanks to the official side for all their assistance. \n \n10. In our questionnaire, we asked for responses on a five point scale, from strongly \ndisagree, to disagree, to no view, to agree and to strongly agree. For convenience of \npresentation, we have combined strongly disagree with disagree, and strongly agree with \nagree. We have also ignored the 'no views', so that the percentages do not add up to 100. \nFinally, the statements in the Tables do not always correspond word for word with those \nin the questionnaire, again for convenience of expression. \n \n11  See Marsden and Richardson (1992) for the detailed results by type of employee. \n  \n12. These figures were published in IRSF Assessment Pay Special, September, 1991. \n \n13. It is sometimes argued that management may not change payment systems in order to \nraise motivation as such, but to signal a change in management style and work objectives, \nand to encourage staff to alter their work in an appropriate way. It could be argued that \nthe role of performance pay in the Citizens' Charter was just this, to signal a change of \norientation to public servants, that they should become more sensitive to the needs of \nordinary citizens, and provide them better value for money. Our research did not address \nthis issue directly. However, our findings suggest that the scheme has not reinforced the \nposition of management, as reporting officers said they found that performance pay had \nmade appraisal, an important means by which they can influence staff performance, more \ndifficult (Tables 5 and 6). Secondly, our general findings in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that \nthe scheme itself had little effect in inciting staff to work more according to the canons of \nthe Citizens' Charter. \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nReferences. \n \nACAS, (1990) Appraisal Related Pay.
