Introduction to Semi-Solid Processing \nMascara, honey and certain kinds of paint are all thixotropic. When they are sheared \nthey flow, when allowed to stand they thicken up again; their viscosity is shear rate \nand time dependent. Spencer et al. [1] first discovered such behaviour in semi-solid \nmetallic alloys in the early 1970s when investigating hot tearing with a rheometer.  If \nthe material was stirred continuously during cooling from the fully liquid state to the \nsemi-solid state the viscosity was significantly lower than if the material was cooled \ninto the semi-solid state without stirring. Stirring breaks up the dendrites which would \nnormally be present so that the microstructure in the semi-solid state consists of \nspheroids of solid surrounded by liquid (Fig.1). It is this microstructure which is a \nrequirement for thixotropic behaviour and for semi-solid processing. When such a \nsemi-solid microstructure is allowed to stand, the spheroids agglomerate and the \nviscosity increases with time. If the material is sheared, the agglomerates are broken \nup and the viscosity falls. In the semi-solid state, with between 30 and 50% liquid, if \nthe alloy is allowed to stand it will support its own weight and can be handled like a \nsolid. As soon as it is sheared, it flows with a viscosity similar to that of heavy \nmachine oil. This is the behaviour which is exploited in semi-solid processing [2] and \nwhich is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the alloy can be cut and spread like butter. \n \nNearly 30 years of work and effort have been invested in the field of semisolid \nprocessing and the increase in interest in this field has been marked by seven \ninternational conferences [3-9] with an eighth planned in Cyprus in 2004. Semisolid \nprocessing is rivalling other manufacturing routes for military, aerospace and most \nnotably automotive components [10-12]. In Europe, suspension parts, engine brackets \n and fuel rails for automotives are being produced. In the USA, examples include \nmechanical parts for mountain bikes and snowmobiles [13], while in Asia there is \nconcentration on the production of electronic components such as computer notebook \ncases and electrical housing components, particularly in magnesium alloys via \nThixomolding [e.g.12]. Fig. 3 shows some of the components produced by \nThixoforming at Stampal for an Alfa Romeo car.  \n \n1.1 Routes to Spheroidal Microstructures \nThere are many different routes for obtaining non-dendritic microstructures. The main \nones are described here. \n1) MagnetoHydroDynamic (MHD) Stirring: This involves stirring \nelectromagnetically (and hence without the contamination, gas entrapment and \nstirrer erosion involved in mechanical stirring) in the semi-solid state to break \nup the dendrites [e.g.14]. Much of the commercial production of aluminium \nalloy components to date has been based on MHD material supplied by \nPechiney and SAG. There are some problems associated with this route \nincluding lack of uniformity and the fact that the spheroids are not completely \nround with some \u2018rosette\u2019 character remaining. \n2) Sprayforming: Sprayforming is a relatively expensive route but one which can \nbe used to produce alloys, which cannot be produced in any other way, such as \naluminium-silicon alloys with greater than 20 wt.% silicon [e.g. 15]. \nSprayforming essentially involves the atomisation of a liquid metal stream and \ncollection of the droplets on a former. The resulting microstructure is fine and \nequiaxed. When heated into the semi-solid state it is ideal for thixoforming \n[16]. \n 3) Strain Induced Melt Activated (SIMA)\/ Recrystallisation And Partial Melting \n(RAP): These routes are similar but distinct. The material is worked, e.g. by \nextrusion. On reheating into the semi-solid state, recrystallisation occurs and \nthe liquid penetrates the recrystallised boundaries so resulting in spheroids \nsurrounded by liquid. The SIMA route [17] involves hot working and the RAP \nroute [18] warm working. The advantages of these routes are that some alloys \nare supplied in the extruded state in any case and the spheroids are more fully \nrounded than those from the MHD route. The main disadvantages are that \nthere may be variation in the amount of stored work across the section, \nresulting in inhomogeneity, and extrusion can be difficult and expensive with \nwider billet diameters. \n4) Liquidus\/Near-Liquidus Casting: There have been recent developments in \nproducing feedstock by manipulating the solidification conditions. The UBE \nNew RheoCasting (NRC) process [19,20] is based on this principle with the \nmolten metal at near-liquidus temperature poured into a tilted crucible and \ngrain nucleation occurring on the side of the crucible. The grain size is fine \nbecause the temperature is near liquidus. An allied technique is the Direct \nThermal Method [21]. In the Cooling Slope method [22], liquid metal is \npoured down a cooled slope and collects in a mould. Nucleation on the slope \nensures the spheroid size is fine. With liquidus casting, a high rate of \nnucleation can be achieved within the entire volume of undercooled melt [23, \n24].  \n5) \u2018New MIT Process\u2019: This is a recently developed hybrid of stirring and near \nliquidus casting [25,26] (Fig. 4). A stirrer that also provides the cooling action \nis inserted into an alloy melt held a few degrees above the liquidus. After some \n seconds of stirring, the melt temperature decreases to a value which \ncorresponds to a fraction of solid of only a few percent and the stirrer is \nwithdrawn. \n6) Grain Refinement: Grain refined alloys can give equiaxed microstructures \n[e.g.26] but it is difficult to ensure the grain structure is uniformly spheroidal \nand fine and the volume of liquid entrapped in spheroids tends to be relatively \nhigh. \n7) Semi-Solid Thermal Transformation: Spheroidal structure can also be \nproduced by heating a dendritic structure to the semisolid temperature range \nfor a period of time. This is known as semi-solid thermal transformation, or \nSSTT [27] The structures produced by this route tend to be relatively coarse \n(around 100 \u00b5m diameter particles). \nOther methods are summarised in [2, 12, 28]. \n  \n1.2 Types of Semi-Solid Processing \n\u2018Semi-solid processing\u2019 now covers a whole family of processes. The terminology is \nas follows. \n\u2018Rheocasting\u2019 refers to the process where the alloy is cooled into the semi-\nsolid state and injected into a die without an intermediate solidification step. A typical \nrheocaster is shown in Fig. 5. The non-dendritic microstructure can be obtained by a \nvariety of means during cooling (e.g. by mechanical stirring, by stimulated nucleation \nof solid particles as in the New RheoCasting NRC process recently patented by UBE \n[19,20] (see Fig. 6), or by electromagnetic stirring in the shot sleeve as in the New \nSemi-Solid Metal Casting process from Hitachi [30] (see Fig. 7). The NRC process \ninvolves pouring molten alloy, at a temperature slightly above the liquidus, into a steel \n crucible and then controlled cooling to achieve a spheroidal microstructure before \ntransfer to a forming machine. There is no need for specially treated thixoformable \nfeedstock and scrap can be readily recycled within the plant. Hall et al [20] showed \nthat the NRC route has a lower unit cost than Thixoforming, due to the lower starting \nmaterial cost.  \n \n\u2018Rheomoulding\u2019 is allied to polymer injection moulding, and uses either a single \nscrew [31,32] or a twin screw [33,34] (Fig 8). Liquid metal is fed into a barrel \nwhere it is cooled while being mechanically stirred by a rotating screw. The \nsemisolid material is then injected into a die cavity. Such processes are suitable \nfor continuous production of large quantities of components and do not require \nspecially produced feedstock material (at a price premium).  \n\u2018Thixo\u2019 usually refers to processes where an intermediate solidification step does \noccur. There are exceptions to this e.g. \u2018Thixomolding\u2019. \n\u2018Thixomolding\u2019 is the process licensed by the firm called \u2018Thixomat\u2019[35,36]. It is now \nused by numerous companies, particularly in Japan and the US, to produce \nmagnesium alloy components, e.g. for portable computers and cameras. As for \nrheomoulding, it is allied to injection moulding of polymers. Magnesium alloy \npellets are fed into a continuously rotating screw (Fig. 9) and the energy \ngenerated by shearing is sufficient to heat the pellets into the semi-solid state. The \nscrew action produces the spheroidal microstructure and the material is injected \ninto a die. Although the process is highly effective with magnesium alloys, \naluminium alloys in the semi-solid state attack the screw and the barrel. \nStrenuous efforts have been made to overcome these problems but it is not clear \nthat a successful commercial outcome has yet been achieved. \n \u2018Thixoforming\u2019 can cover both \u2018thixocasting\u2019, \u2018thixoforging\u2019 and an intermediate \nprocess called \u2018thixoforming\u2019. \n\u2018Thixocasting\u2019 usually means that the alloy is solid initially and has been treated in \nsuch a way that when it is heated into the semi-solid state it will have a non-\ndendritic microstructure. It is reheated into the semi-solid state and \u2018casting\u2019 is \nimplying that the liquid content prior to forming is relatively high i.e. above \nabout 50 vol. %. This is the type of process used by Magnetti Marelli in Italy to \nproduce fuel rails [37]. \n\u2018Thixoforging\u2019 describes the process where suitable material is heated into the semi-\nsolid state and placed between dies halves [e.g.38]. The parts of the die are then \nbrought together by a ram. The direct insertion of the slurry into the die reduces \nmaterial use because of the lack of runners, gate and press discard.  \n\u2018Thixoforming\u2019 is the process where suitable material is heated into the semi-solid \nstate and injected into a die. Usually, the liquid content is between 30 and 50% \nprior to forming. This is the type of process used by Stampal in Italy to produce \nthe Alfa Romeo suspension component and a number of other automotive \ncomponents [39]. It is also the process used by Vforge in the US to produce \nmaster cylinders, anti-lock brake system valves and automotive steering pumps \namongst others. A thixoforming press is shown in Fig. 10 and illustrates the steps \nin the process, although it is a vertically upwards acting press whereas most \ncommercial presses are horizontal. The specimen is induction heated into the \nsemi-solid state. When it has reached the appropriate proportion of liquid it is \nforced into the die. Usually in commercial thixoforming, the slugs are heated on a \ncarousel. Cycle times are then very comparable with die casting, if not faster \nbecause the full solidification range does not have to be gone through. \n  \nThe distinctions between rheocasting, thixocasting and thixoforging are illustrated in \nFig. 11 [40].  \n \nOther processes include the shear-cooling roll (SCR) process [41,42] and the cooling \nslope process [43]. In addition, there is the possibility of using semi-solid slurries in \nSolid FreeForm (SSF) technology [44]. This method deposits a stream of slurry \nthrough a nozzle that moves relative to a substrate. Components are built by building \nup successive layers so as to rapidly fabricate dense metal structures.  \n \n1.3 Advantages and Disadvantages \nAs with any manufacturing process, there are certain advantages and disadvantages in \nsemisolid processing. They are [2, 45-47]: \n \nAdvantages  \nThe main advantages of semi-solid processing, relative to die casting, are as follows. \n1) Energy efficiency: Metal is not being held in the liquid state over long periods \nof time. \n2) Production rates are similar to pressure die casting or better. \n3) Smooth filling of the die with no air entrapment and low shrinkage porosity \ngives parts of high integrity (including thin-walled sections) and allows \napplication of the process to higher-strength heat-treatable alloys. \n4) Lower processing temperatures reduce the thermal shock on the die, \npromoting die life and allowing the use of non-traditional die materials \n [e.g.48] and processing of high melting point alloys such as tool steels and \nstellites [49] that are difficult to form by other means. \n5) Lower impact on the die also introduces the possibility of rapid prototyping \ndies [48] \n6) Fine, uniform microstructures give enhanced properties. \n7) Reduced solidification shrinkage gives dimensions closer to near net shape \nand justifies the removal of machining steps; the near net shape capability \n(quantified, for example, in [50]) reduces machining costs and material losses. \n8) Surface quality is suitable for plating. \n \nDisadvantages  \n1) The cost of raw material can be high and the number of suppliers small. \n2) Process knowledge and experience has to be continually built up in order to \nfacilitate application of the process to new components. \n3) This leads to potentially higher die development costs. \n4) Initially at least, personnel require a higher level of training and skill than with \nmore traditional processes. \n5) Temperature control. Fraction solid and viscosity in the semisolid state are \nvery dependent on temperature. Alloys with a narrow temperature range in the \nsemisolid region require accurate control of the temperature. \n6) Liquid segregation due to non-uniform heating can result in non-uniform \ncomposition in the component. \nThe economic advantages of thixoforming have been discussed [51,52], including the \nuse of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to evaluate the interrelationships between \nthixoforming characteristics (energy usage, near net shape capability, mechanical \n integrity of product, short cycle time, reduced die wear, raw material cost, process \ndevelopment, skills\/wages of work force) and product characteristics (weight, \nstrength, geometry, tolerances, price premium, lead time, flexibility, finishing \noperations) and quantified in software (www.shef.ac.uk\/~ibberson\/thixo.html). The \neconomics of the NRC process have been analysed [20]. The NRC process does not \nsuffer from the disadvantage of 1). Such analysis is important for industries adopting \nnovel manufacturing methods where the cost base is not yet established through \n\u2018custom and practice\u2019. \n \nMuch of the work on semisolid processing has been reported in the major series of \nconferences [3-9]. Some of these conferences have been refereed whilst others have \nnot. It is therefore the policy in this review to give references as far as possible to \nrefereed journal papers if the work has subsequently been published in that form. \nPrevious reviews include those by Kenney et al [14], Flemings [45], Kirkwood [2], \nQuaak [47], Collot [53] and Fan [12]. In addition, a book has recently been published \nedited by Figueredo [29]. The recent Fan review is comprehensive and the aim here is \nto complement that by providing a more detailed review of modelling of semi-solid \nprocessing and the transient rheological experiments required to provide data for that.   \n \nMillions of components are now made annually by semisolid processing. Aluminium \nalloy components produced by thixoforming and the NRC process are supplied to the \nautomotive industry. Thixomolding is widely used, particularly in Japan, to produce \nlightweight magnesium components for mobile phones, laptop computers and \ncameras. New variants are still emerging (e.g. the \u2018new MIT process\u2019 [25]). The \ncutting edge research issues are now in developing the potential for producing high \n performance alloys [54-60] and in modelling die fill with its concomitant requirement \nto obtain the experimental data which can support the modelling. This review focuses \non the latter two areas. \n \n2. Background Rheology \n \nIn a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress,\u03c4  is proportional to the shear rate,\u03b3\uf026 , and the \nconstant of proportionality is the viscosity, \u03b7 . Thixotropic fluids are non-Newtonian \ni.e. the shear stress is not proportional to the shear rate. The viscosity is then termed \nthe apparent viscosity and is dependent on shear rate, pressure, temperature and time. \nSome non-linear fluids also show viscoelasticity i.e. they store some of the \nmechanical energy as elastic energy. Thixotropic materials do not store energy \nelastically and show no elastic recovery when the stress is removed. \n \nIf a fluid exhibits a yield stress and then gives a linear relationship between shear \nstress and shear rate, it is termed a Bingham material (Fig.2). Then: \n\u03b3\u03c4\u03c4 \uf026ky +=                                                                                                         (1)    \nwhere k  is a constant related to the viscosity.  The Herschel-Bulkley model is where \nbehaviour is non-linear after yield i.e.: \nn\ny k\u03b3\u03c4\u03c4 \uf026+=                                                                                                                (2). \nThere is dispute over whether thixotropic semi-solid alloys display yield [eg.61] and \nwhether they should be modelled as such (e.g. [62]). Barnes [63-65] concluded that \nthe presence of a yield stress as reported by some workers for thixotropic materials \n(but not semisolid alloys) is probably due to the limitations of their experimental \napparatus in not being able to measure shear stresses at very low shear rates. Koke \n and Modigell [66] have used a shear stress controlled rheometer to measure yield \nstress directly on Sn 15%Pb. They distinguish between a static yield stress where the \nfluid is at rest prior to the application of a shear stress, and a dynamic yield stress \nwhere the fluid is being continuously sheared. Their results are shown in Fig. 13. The \nyield stress increases with rest time prior to deformation because of the increasing \ndegree of agglomeration. In terms of modelling semi-solid alloy die fill, the use of a \nyield stress may be appropriate because a vertical billet does not collapse under its \nown weight unless the liquid fraction is too high. In addition, in rapid compression \nexperiments to be described later (in Section 5.2) an initial peak in the load versus \ndisplacement curve is detected. Contrary to this though is the fact that at the \n\u2018thixoforming temperature\u2019 the initial peak is so small as to be undetectable. \n \nThe Ostwald de Waele relationship: \n \nnk\u03b3\u03c4 \uf026=                                                                                                               (3) \n \nis used to describe fluids which do not have a yield point and where there is a power \nlaw relationship between the shear stress \u03c4 and the shear rate \u03b3\uf026 . If the exponent 1=n , \nthis reduces to the expression for a Newtonian fluid with the constant k equal to the \nviscosity \u03b7. In Fig. 12, the shear thinning material (whose viscosity decreases as the \nshear rate increases) would have a value of n of less than 1 and the shear thickening \nmaterial would have n  greater than one. Thixotropic materials are essentially shear \nthinning but also thicken again when allowed to rest (i.e. all thixotropic materials are \nshear thinning but not all shear thinning fluids are thixotropic).  \n \n It is thought that at very high shear rates and at very low shear rates, thixotropic fluids \neffectively become Newtonian. This is expressed in the Cross model [67]: \n \n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n+\n\u2212\n+= \u221e\u221e nk\u03b3\n\u03b7\u03b7\n\u03b7\u03b7\n\uf0261\n0                                                                                           (4) \n \nwhere as the shear rate 0,0 \u03b7\u03b7\u03b3 \u2192\u2192\uf026  and as \u221e\u2192\u221e\u2192 \u03b7\u03b7\u03b3 ,\uf026 . Fig. 14 shows data \nfrom a number of studies [67-70] for Sn 15% Pb alloys with various fractions of solid \nfs. The data obey the Cross model, but information on the extremes is sparse. These \ndata are for steady-state viscosities and, as will be discussed below, it is the transient \nbehaviour which is of importance for the modelling of thixotropic die fill. \n \nViscosity is highly dependent on temperature. For a Newtonian fluid (e.g. the liquid \nmatrix in a semisolid slurry), the viscosity decreases with increase in temperature. \nTemperature also affects the microstructure. Thus in semisolid slurries, the fraction \nsolid decreases with increase in temperature, with a consequent effect on viscosity \n(see Fig. 14). In addition, over time, the microstructure will coarsen by diffusion and \nthis will be accelerated as the temperature increases. Fig. 14 is for Sn 15%Pb alloy. \nThere is little data on aluminium alloys because there are few commercially available \nrheometers that operate above about 500\u02daC. \n \nFor a thixotropic material at rest, when a step increase in shear rate is imposed, the \nshear stress will peak and then gradually decrease until it reaches an equilibrium value \nfor the shear rate over time (Fig. 15). The higher the shear rate after the step, the \nlower the equilibrium viscosity. The peak viscosity encountered will increase with \n increasing rest time before it recovers back to the equilibrium viscosity of the shear \nrate specified. \n \n3. Origins of Thixotropy \n \nWhat is the microstructural origin of thixotropic behaviour? The importance of the \nspheroidal microstructure which results on stirring has already been mentioned. The \nsemisolid metallic systems have much in common with flocculated suspensions (Fig. \n16). At the shear rate 1\u03b3\uf026 corresponding to point \u2018a\u2019, the microstructure consists of a \nseries of large flocs. If the shear rate is increased from 1\u03b3\uf026  to 2\u03b3\uf026 , the flocs break up \nuntil the size corresponds to the flow curve which passes through point \u2018b\u2019. If the \nshear rate is then reduced back to 1\u03b3\uf026 , the individual particles begin to collide and \nagglomerate until an equilibrium size is reached appropriate to the lower shear rate. In \nsemisolid metallic systems, the agglomeration occurs because particles are colliding \n(either because the shear brings them into contact or, if at rest, because of sintering) \nand, if favourably oriented, form a boundary. By \u2018favourable orientation\u2019 is meant the \nfact that if the particles are oriented in such a way that a low energy boundary is \nformed, it will be more energetically favourable for the agglomeration to occur than if \na high energy boundary is formed. If a 3-D network builds up throughout the material, \nthe semisolid will support its own weight and can be handled like a solid. As the shear \nrate is increased, these bonds between particles are broken up and the average \nagglomerate size decreases. Once the bonds are formed, the agglomerated particles \nsinter, with the neck size increasing with time.  \n \n The viscosity in the steady state depends on the balance between the rate of structure \nbuildup and the rate of breakdown. It also depends on the particle morphology. The \ncloser the shape to that of a pure sphere, the lower the steady state viscosity \n[45\u2026summarising much earlier work]. In addition, if liquid is entrapped within \nparticles, it does not contribute to flow. Thus, although the fraction liquid may take a \ncertain value, governed by the temperature (and indeed kinetics as the \nthermodynamically predicted fraction liquid is not achieved instantaneously on \nreheating from the solid state), in practice, the effective fraction liquid may be less as \nsome is entrapped within spheroids.  \n \nThere are similarities and differences between thixotropy in semi-solid metallic \nsystems and that in other thixotropic systems. These are associated with the nature of \nthe forces between the particles. Table 1 summarises the phenomena which are \noccurring during structural buildup and structural breakdown in a variety of systems. \nIn general, the forces between particles include:- Van der Waals attraction; steric \nrepulsion due to adsorbed macromolecules; electrostatic repulsion due to the presence \nof like charges on the particles and a dielectric medium; electrostatic attraction \nbetween unlike charges on different parts of the particle (e.g. edge\/face attraction \nbetween clay particles). In semisolid metallic slurries, none of these forces apply. \nWhat must actually be occurring in structural buildup is a process akin to adhesion in \nwear. As shear occurs, particles are forced into contact with each other. If it is \nenergetically favourable for a solid-solid boundary to be formed, the two particles will \nstay in contact. If not, they will separate again. The process will be influenced by the \nrate of shear in two opposing ways. Increasing the rate of shear will increase the \npossibility of particle-particle contact but it will decrease the time of contact and the \n formation of a new solid-solid boundary is a time dependent process. When the slurry \nis at rest, gravity will bring the particles into contact. In addition, if the solid fraction  \nis sufficiently high, the packing density will be such that particles touch each other. \nStructural breakdown requires the breakdown of particle-particle bonds and this will \ndepend on the cross-sectional area of the bond and the radius of the neck which \ngenerates a stress concentrating effect. \n \nCan this process be represented by a force-distance curve for the particle-particle \ninteraction as has been assumed in other systems? If it can, the forces are very short \nrange (perhaps<1 nm) and the potential well is deep because many bonds do form. \n \nIn many thixotropic systems, the Brownian (thermal) randomising force is significant. \nFor particles of all shapes, this constant randomisation influences the radial \ndistribution function (i.e. the spatial arrangement of particles as seen from the centre \nof any one particle). The Brownian force is strongly size dependent, so that below a \nparticle size of 1 \u03bcm it has a big influence. In semisolid alloy slurries though, the \nindividual particle size tends to be at least 20 \u03bcm and so the Brownian force does not \nplay a strong part. The other force which acts on the particles is the viscous force, \nwhich is proportional to the local velocity difference between the particle and the \nsurrounding fluid. \n \nMany thixotropic systems show \u2018reversibility\u2019 i.e. the slurries have a steady state \nviscosity characteristic of a given shear rate at a given fraction solid regardless of past \nshearing history. However, in semisolid alloy slurry systems, the evolution of particle \nshape (and size) with time and stirring (Fig.17) is irreversible. The measured viscosity \n is then expected to depend on the shearing and thermal history. These dependencies \ncontribute to the difficulty in modelling.  \n \n4. Mathematical Theories of Thixotropy \nBarnes [65] has summarised current mathematical theories of thixotropy. Some detail \non these is given here to enable work on semisolid slurries to be put in the context of \nthe wider understanding of thixotropy. The theories fall into three groups: \n1) Those that use a general description of the degree of structural buildup in the \nmicrostructure, denoted by a scalar parameter, typically \u03bb, and then use d\u03bb\/dt \nas the working parameter; \n2) Those that attempt some direct description of the temporal change of \nmicrostructure as for instance the number of bonds or an attempt at describing \nthe real floc architecture using fractal analysis; \n3) Those that use viscosity time data itself on which to base a theory. \n \n4.1 Models Based on a Structural Parameter \u03bb \nA completely built structure is represented by 1=\u03bb and a completely broken down \nstructure by 0=\u03bb . In the simplest case of a typical, inelastic, non-Newtonian fluid \nwith upper and lower Newtonian viscosity plateaus (e.g. see Fig.14), 1=\u03bb  \ncorresponds to 0\u03b7  and  0=\u03bb  to \u221e\u03b7  . Thixotropy is usually then introduced via the \ntime derivative of the structure parameter, d\u03bb \/dt .This is the sum of the breakdown \nand buildup terms and in the simplest theories these are only controlled by the shear \nrate and the current level of structure \u03bb . The most general description of the rate of \nbreakdown due to shearing is given by the product of the current level of structure and \nthe shear rate raised to some power and the driving force for buildup as controlled by \n the distance the structure is from its maximum value i.e. (1-\u03bb ), raised to another \npower. Then  \n \n( ) db ca\ndt\nd\n\u03b3\u03bb\u03bb\n\u03bb \uf026\u2212\u2212= 1                                                                                           (5) \nwhere a, b, c, and d are constants for any one system. Overall, if the value of d\u03bb \/dt is \nnegative, the system is breaking down towards equilibrium and if it is positive it is \nbuilding up towards equilibrium. The Moore model [72] is a simplified version of \nequation (5) with b and d set to one. Cheng and Evans [73] set 1=b but allowed d to \nvary. The next step is to relate the structure \u03bb , (as calculated using the equations \nabove), to the stress \u03c4 or viscosity \u03b7  in some flow equation. This has been done in a \nvariety of ways which range from a simple Bingham equation (see equation (1) in \nSection 2), through the Cross model to a Cross-like model (equation (4) in Section 2) \ncontaining a yield stress.  \n \n4.2 Direct Structure Theories \nDenny and Brodkey [74] applied reaction kinetics to thixotropy via a simple scheme \nthat examined the distribution of broken and unbroken bonds. The number of these \nbonds was later linked to viscosity. The rate of structure breakdown was then: \n \nqp brokenkunbrokenk\ndt\nunbrokend )()()( 21 \u2212=\u2212                                                (6) \nwhere 1k  and 2k are the rate constants for the breakdown and buildup respectively. \nThis can be solved to give the viscosity by assuming that viscosity is linearly \nproportional to the amount of unbroken structure, with a maximum value when \ncompletely structured of 0\u03b7  and a minimum value when completely destructured of \n \u221e\u03b7 . The rate constant 2k  is assumed to be independent of shear rate, being merely a \ndescription of Brownian collisions leading to restructuring (but note that for semisolid \nalloy slurries build up is not due to Brownian collisions- Section 3), while 1k  is \nrelated to the shear rate by a power law expression. \n \nThe Cross model [67] was derived using such considerations. Assuming that a \nstructured liquid was made up of flocs (agglomerates) of randomly linked chains of \nparticles, Cross obtained a rate equation of the form: \n \nNkkPk\ndt\ndN m )( 102 \u03b3\uf026+\u2212=                                                                                     (7) \nwhere N was the average number of links per chain, 2k  was a rate constant describing \nBrownian collision, 0k  and 1k  were rate constants for the Brownian and shear \ncontributions to breakdown, P was the number of single particles per unit volume and \nn was a constant less than unity. At equilibrium, dN\/dt is zero, so: \n \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\n=\nn\ne\nk\nk\nk\nPk\nN\n\u03b3\uf026\n0\n1\n0\n2\n1\n .                                                                                           (8) \n \nAssuming that the viscosity was given by the constant \u221e\u03b7  plus a viscous contribution \nproportional to the number of bonds Ne, \n  \nn\nk\nk\n\u03b3\u03b7\u03b7\n\u03b7\u03b7\n\uf026\n0\n10 1\n1\n+\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\u221e                                                                                             (9) \n  \nwhich is equivalent to the expression given earlier in equation (4) but with 01 \/ kkk = .  \n \nLapasin et al [75] used a fractal approach to describe flocculated suspensions. In the \nrelationship they predicted, the viscosity is related to: the number of primary particles \nin a floc when the shear stress becomes infinite, a yield stress and the fractal \ndimension of the floc. \n \n \n \n4.3 Simple Viscosity Theories \nMewis and Schryvers [76] have devised a theory that circumvents the use of any \nstructural parameter such as \u03bb , and instead uses the viscosity as a direct measure of \nthe structure. The rate of change of viscosity is then related to the viscosity difference \nbetween the steady state e\u03b7  and the current values of viscosity (not the structure \ndifference) i.e.: \n \n( )[ ]nsKdt\nd\n\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u2212= \uf026 .

Transient Behaviour of Semi-Solid Alloys \n \nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can be used to predict die filling [see Section \n6]. However, some of the work reported has been based on rheological data obtained \nin steady state experiments, where the semi-solid material has been maintained at a \nparticular shear rate for some time. In reality, in thixoforming the slurry undergoes a \nsudden increase in shear rate from rest to 100s-1 or more as it enters the die. This \nchange takes place in less than a second. Hence, measuring the transient rheological \nresponse under rapid changes in shear rate is critical to the development of modelling \nof die filling and successful die design for industrial processing. It can be investigated \nwith two types of experiment. Firstly, via rapid shear rate changes in a rheometer and \nsecondly, for higher fractions solid (where the torque capability of a rheometer is not \nsufficient), with rapid compression experiments, for example, in the thixoformer itself \nor in a drop forge viscometer. \n \n 5.1 Rapid Shear Rate Changes in Rheometers \nStudies of transient behaviour have included those by Kumar [79], Quaak [47], Peng \nand Wang [80], Mada and Ajersch [81,82], Azzi et al [83] Koke and Modigell [66] \nModigell and Koke [84,85] and Liu et al. [71,86]. Two relaxation times were \nquantified: (1) breakdown time and (2) buildup time. The breakdown time is the \ncharacteristic time for the slurry to achieve its steady-state condition after a shear rate \n change from a lower value to a higher value, while the buildup time is for a change \nfrom a higher shear rate to a lower shear rate. These workers found that the times for \nbreakdown are faster than those for buildup. This would be expected, as the breaking \nup of \u2018bonds\u2019 between spheroidal solid particles in agglomerates is likely to be easier \nthan the formation of bonds during shear-rate drops. Quaak [47] proposes two \ncharacteristic times to describe a shear rate jump. He suggests that during a shear-rate \nchange, the slurry undergoes an initial rapid breakdown\/buildup followed by a more \ngradual process dependent on diffusion. This can be described by a double \nexponential expression. Quaak gives Fig.18 as the microstructural basis. Immediately \nafter a change in shear rate, the structure remains the same (\u2018iso-structure\u2019). This is \nfollowed by a very fast process and then a slow process, associated with diffusion, \ngiving coarsening and spheroidisation. It is the \u2018very fast process\u2019 which is relevant to \nmodelling die fill. \n \nIn a rheometer, great care must be taken to ensure that inertial effects do not interfere \nwith the results [e.g. see 86]. In addition, instrumental effects must be carefully \nseparated from those of the material itself, particularly when attempting to examine \nbehaviour that occurs in less than a second. For example, electronic switching may \noccur during the shear rate jump. This can be allowed for by only analysing results \nafter the shear rate has reached ~90% of the specified final shear rate (see [86]). The \nwork of Liu et al. [86] involves the fastest data collection rate so far (~1 kHz capture \nrate). This is significantly faster than that used by other workers (200 Hz in [79], 9 Hz \nin [47], 200 Hz in [80]) and enables the capture of the very fast process. The results \nfor shear rate jumps from 0 to 100 s-1 after different rest times are shown in Fig.19. \nWith longer rest times, the peak stress recorded increases. The breakdown times in \n Table 2 were obtained by fitting an exponential to the data obtained during the second \nafter 90% of the final shear rate was achieved. In Table 2, \u03b7p is the peak-stress \nviscosity, \u03b7ss is the \u2018first\u2019 steady-state viscosity (given that there are at least two \nprocesses going on as mentioned earlier) and b\u03c4  is the \u2018first\u2019 breakdown time. Table 2 \nshows that the longer the rest time prior to the shear rate jump, the lower the \nbreakdown time. This is consistent with microstructural evidence (Fig.20) showing \nthat increasing the rest time increases the solid-particle sizes and the degree of \nagglomeration. This increase would impede the movement of the particles upon the \nimposition of the shear stress. The ease with which particles are able to move past \neach other depends on the fraction of liquid medium present, the size of the particles \nand the degree of agglomeration. The data show that during a change in shear rate, in \nabout 0.15 seconds the semisolid structure would have broken down from its initial \nstate. Regardless of the initial shear rate, the breakdown time decreases with \nincreasing final shear rate [47, 81-83, 85, 86]. \n \nAs far as the existence of \u2018iso-structure\u2019 during the jump is concerned, Turng and \nWang [69] and Peng and Wang [80] observed an overshoot in the measured stress \nduring a rapid increase in shear rate. They found that this overshoot (or undershoot in \nthe case of a decrease in shear rate) is proportional to the change in shear rate. \nTherefore, they argue, for that instant, the material is behaving in a Newtonian way. \nThe viscosity, and hence the structure, is constant, during the change. Peng and Wang \n[80] observed that the overshoot increases with increasing solid fraction. Horsten et \nal. [87] and Quaak and co-workers [40,47] argued that during this transient period \nstructure evolution has not had time to occur and the structure corresponds to that of \nthe previous shear rate. Kumar et al [88] and Koke and Modigell [66] however, find \n shear thickening \u2018iso-structural\u2019 flow behaviour (e.g. Fig.21). In [66], after each shear \nrate jump, the substance is sheared at 0\u03b3\uf026  to obtain equilibrium before the next jump. \nThe plot of shear stress versus shear rate can be fitted with a shear thickening \nHerschel-Bulkley model with a flow-exponent 07.2=n . Koke and Modigell [66] \nargue that this finding is of high importance for simulation of the industrial process. \n \n Data on the transient behaviour of aluminium alloys is sparse because the majority of \nthe commercially available rheometers do not operate at semisolid aluminium alloy \ntemperatures. \n \n5.2 Rapid Compression \n \nFor high solid fractions, above about 0.5, conventional rheometers do not have \nsufficient torque capability. Other methods must then be used, introducing complexity \nbecause the shear rate is no longer constant throughout the material (as it can be \nassumed to be in a concentric cylinder rheometer). Laxmanan and Flemings [68] \nmeasured the force and displacement for Sn 15%Pb compressed between parallel \nplates at low strain rates. The resulting load was not measured directly (but rather, \nderived from the pressure on the ram) and the rate of compression was much slower \nthan in the industrial process. The work of Lou\u00e9 et al [89], carried out at higher shear \nrates by backward extrusion on aluminium alloys, resembles industrial thixoforming \nmore closely. However, the specimens were heated to temperature over a long period \nof time (~ 10 minutes) and then held isothermally for 30 minutes before compression. \nSuch time periods would be considered long in industrial thixoforming. Yurko and \nFlemings [90] designed a drop forge viscometer (Fig.22) to study fluid flow behaviour \n at transient high shear rates. It consists of a lower platen and an upper platen, with an \nattached platen rod to track platen motion with time. It is similar to a parallel plate \ncompression viscometer but the upper plate is allowed to fall under the influence of \ngravity. A high speed digital camera images the rod as it falls. The force is calculated \nfrom the second derivative of the displacement data allowing calculation of viscosities \nat shear rates in excess of 1000 s-1. A typical experiment yields instantaneous, \nvolume-averaged viscosity first under rapidly increasing shear rate and then under \nrapidly decreasing shear rate. Segregation of liquid from solid did not occur at the \nhigh shear rates. Liu et al. [91] have carried out rapid compression in the thixoformer \nitself using a load cell to record the load versus time signals. The compression rate is \nthen akin to industrial thixoforming and the load is measured directly. A typical signal \nresponse is shown in Fig.23. The peak is believed to originate from the three-\ndimensional skeletal structure built up in the solid phase at rest, which breaks down \nunder load. The width of the peak (or, more accurately, the downward part of it) is a \nmeasure of the time taken to destroy this skeletal structure. A rough estimate then \ngives a breakdown time of about 10 ms, an order of magnitude less than the relaxation \ntimes obtained from shear rate jumps in rheometer experiments (see Section 5.1) and \nmust therefore be related to a different mechanism. The height of the peak falls with \ntemperature as the skeletal structure is consumed, and the minimum load beyond the \npeak also decreases with increasing temperature, both because a more spheroidal \nmicrostructure is developed and the fraction liquid increases (see Fig.24). In practice, \nsuccessful thixoforming takes place at temperatures where there is little or no peak. \nViscosity versus shear rate can be derived from the load-displacement data using a \nmethod based on that outlined in Laxmanan and Flemings [68]. This does however \nassume a Newtonian fluid at one stage in the analysis and this may introduce errors.  \n  \nData on viscosity versus shear rate for Al-Si alloys is summarised in Fig. 25. It is \nimportant to be aware that small changes in silicon content can affect the results quite \nconsiderably by changing the solid fraction. The lower values recorded by Yurko and \nFlemings [90] in comparison with those of Liu et al. [91] are derived for an alloy with \nhigher silicon content and also one which has been soaked for longer (giving a larger \nparticle size and consequently lower viscosity). Included in the figure is the steady-\nstate viscosity determined by Quaak [47] for a 7% Si aluminium alloy, extrapolated to \n0.5 fraction solid; this is well below the other results, emphasizing that the steady \nstate is not achieved in those experiments, nor in industrial thixoforming.  \n \n  \n6. Modelling  \n \nThe recent commercialisation has highlighted the need to model slurry flow into die \ncavities. Die design and processing conditions such as ram speed, dwell time and \npressure have, to some extent, been a matter of trial and error.  In particular, die \ndesign rules from die casting are not transferable to thixoforming. This is illustrated in \nFig.26, where attempts were made to produce a generic demonstrator consisting of a \nround plate with three bolt holes and a central boss.  In preliminary trials, there was \ndifficulty in filling the die.  Therefore, partial filling experiments were carried out \nwhich demonstrated that the design of the die, particularly the in-gate, which was \nnarrow as for die-casting, led to some jet flow across the cavity (Fig.26(a)) instead of \nthe smooth progressive filling which is the aim in thixoforming. FLOW3D (a \nComputational Fluid Dynamics Programme produced by FLOWSCIENCE, Los \n Alamos) was used to model the flow into the die, trying out different viscosities in \norder to find the range in which the experimental behaviour was mimicked (e.g. \nFig.26(b)). The agreement was promising given that the work did not take into \naccount heat transfer in the die nor friction at the die surface. In addition, the model \ndid not, in the version used, incorporate thixotropic behaviour as such (i.e. it assumed \nthe fluid had a constant viscosity, independent of the shear rate and time, which in \npractice is not the case). Changing the design of the die in the light of the findings of \nthis \u2018simple\u2019 modelling led to improved filling (e.g. Fig.26(c)). There is, therefore, \nreal potential commercial benefit to be obtained from better understanding of flow of \nsemi-solid material in dies, alongside the academic interest. \n \nIn this section modelling is reviewed. Previous reviews include those by Kirkwood \n[92], Atkinson [93] and Alexandrou [chapter 5 in 28]. Table 3 summarises the main \npapers on modelling [94-125]. The papers are given in year order and this is carried \nover into Tables 4, 5 and 6 which give further information.  These Tables are not \nexhaustive and, where authors have published in journals in addition to conferences, it \nis the journal papers which are cited. The papers are classified as to whether the \nmodelling is finite difference or finite element, one-phase or two-phase. There is in \naddition, a paper on micro-modelling [125] which does not strictly fit any of these \ncategories. A major aim here is to draw out the similarities and the differences \nbetween the flow and viscosity equations which modellers are using. In Tables 4, 5 \nand 6, this is done by quoting the equations from the papers but converting the \nsymbols as far as possible to be common. A Glossary of Symbols is given. Where the \nequations are given in complex terms they are then reduced to simple shear which \nallows more direct comparison. It must be assumed, since this is not made explicit in \n most papers, that where a derivative, for example with respect to t is given as t\u2202\u2202 \/ or \ndtd \/ , that this is in fact the substantive derivative DtD \/  following the material as it \nmoves. Tables 4, 5 and 6 identify the main features of the models and also \nobservations on simulation results and whether these have been validated. Where \ncommercial code has been used this is identified with the reference. The main threads \nin the development of each of the categories are discussed below, with an initial \nsection on the model of Brown and co-workers since this has been used by a number \nof researchers. Thus, the finite difference papers are grouped as to whether they are \nbased on:- The Model of Brown et al. (Section 6.2.1); FLOW3D (Section 6.2.2); \nMAGMAsoft (Section 6.2.3); Adstefan (Section 6.2.4); Two-Phase Modelling \n(Section 6.2.5). For the one-phase finite element papers (Section 6.3.1) in some cases \nit makes sense to group the papers according to author. Thus, the headings are:- \nZavaliangos and Lawley; Backer; Alexandrou, Burgos and co-workers; Viscoplastic \nconstitutive models; Power Law Cut Off (PLCO) Model of Procast; Model Based on \nViscoelasticity and Thixotropy. The two phase finite element papers are sensibly dealt \nwith as a single section (Section 6.3.2) but highlighting the distinctive features of the \npapers. The work of Rouff et al. [125] on Micro-Modelling is covered in section 6.3.3. \n \n6.1 Model of Brown and Co-Workers  \n \nBrown and co-workers [127-129] presented a constitutive model based on the \u2018single \ninternal variable\u2019 concept (see Section 4.1), where the structural parameter \u03bb  varies \nbetween 0 and 1, depending on whether the structure is fully broken down or fully \nbuilt-up respectively. Their model assumes that flow resistance is due to \nhydrodynamic flow of agglomerates and deformation of solid particles within the \n agglomerates. It has been used by a number of workers both for finite difference and \nfor finite element modelling (Ilegbusi and Brown [94]], Ilegbusi et al. [102], \nZavaliangos and Lawley [103], Backer [104]). Ilegbusi and Brown [94] used it in their \nfinite difference work but also introduced a yield stress y\u03c4 . The second term on the \nright hand side in equation (12) (at the top of Table 4) represents the hydrodynamic \ninteraction among agglomerates, with ( )\u03bbA  a hydrodynamic coefficient depending on \nthe size, distribution and morphology of the particle agglomerates. The term is linear \nin shear rate and increases non-linearly with the solid fraction, sf  (the effective \nvolume fraction of solid ( )\u03bb1.01+= sfc ). It depends weakly on sf  for sf <0.5 but \nthen increases at an increasing rate towards an infinite asymptote at a given solid \nfraction and state of agglomeration. The third term on the right hand side represents \nthe deformation resistance due to energy dissipated in the plastically deforming \nparticle-particle bonds. Under isothermal conditions and at constant structure this term \nindicates a shear rate thickening response with 1>n - during rapid shear rate \ntransients, the deformation resistance increases with increasing shear rate (consistent \nwith experimental work by Kumar et al [129]). There is debate as to whether shear \nrate thickening is the constant structure response (e.g. see [84]). The term exhibits a \nstrong inverse dependence on temperature through ( )RTnQCTC exp)( 0= , which \nbrings in the temperature dependence of diffusional processes and the temperature \ndependence of the solid deformation. \n \nEquation (13) (the second equation in Table 4) represents evolution of the structure \nparameter as a function of flow conditions and state variables. H  is an agglomeration \nfunction and G a disagglomeration function representing the shear-induced rupture of \nthe particle-particle bonds. \n  \nOverall the model of Brown et al predicts an increase in deformation resistance with \nthe solid fraction and this becomes rapid between 0.5 and 0.6 sf . Brown et al. state \nthat it is not valid beyond this sharp increase in deformation resistance and is \napplicable only for 6.05.0 \u2212<sf .   \n  \n6.2 Finite Difference Modelling \n \n6.2.1 One Phase Finite Difference based on the Model of Brown et al.  \n \nIlegbusi and Brown [94] use the Brown et al. model (see Section 6.1), but with a yield \nstress, to examine flow into a chisel shaped cavity. This showed the importance of \nheating the die and the heat transfer coefficient, as a solid shell formed at the mould \nwall leading to \u2018jetting\u2019 in the centre of the cavity.  \n \n6.2.2 One Phase Finite Difference Based on FLOW3D \n \nThe approach to thixotropic modelling in the FLOW3D code is outlined in \nBarkhudarov et al. [95] and Barkhudarov and Hirt [96]. Barkhudarov et al. [95] use a \ntransport equation (equation (14) in Table 4) for the viscosity \u03b7  rather than a \ntransport equation for \u03bb  because this is more convenient for CFD, which requires a \nvalue for \u03b7 . This is therefore reminiscent of the simple viscosity theories in Section \n4.3. The transport equation includes an advection term and a relaxation term which \naccounts for the thixotropy of the material. The relaxation term is based on two \nvariables, the steady state viscosity e\u03b7  and the relaxation time \u03c91 , both of which \n may be functions of shear rate and solid fraction. No yield stress, wall slip or elastic \nor plastic behaviour at high solid fractions are included. This simple model therefore \napplies for 7.06.0 \u2212<sf .  It can be related to the Moore model (see Section 4.1 and \n[72]) and t\u2202\u2202\u03bb  then includes agglomeration and disagglomeration terms. Here \ndisagglomeration is dependent on \u03b3\uf026  and not n\u03b3\uf026  as in the Model of Brown et al. [127-\n129]. Barkhudarov et al. [95] used their model to predict hysteresis curves for Sn \n15%Pb with reasonable accuracy and to predict die swell when the relaxation time is \nsimilar to the time it takes for the metal to flow through the nozzle. The equation in \nBarkhudarov and Hirt [96] (equation (18) in Table 4) is an extension of that in \nBarkhudarov et al. [95]. If the local viscosity is greater than the equilibrium viscosity \ne\u03b7  then the local viscosity is driven towards e\u03b7  at the thinning rate \u03b1 , if the local \nviscosity is less than the equilibrium viscosity then it is driven towards e\u03b7  at the \nthickening rate \u03b2 . In this work it is assumed that \u03b1  and \u03b2  are constants, but \npractically it is likely that they are dependent on shear rate. The test problem is one of \nSn-15%Pb droplets impacting on a flat plate. The results show that droplet shape is \ninfluenced by relaxation time. The approach outlined here is essentially the basis for \nthe thixotropic module in the FLOW3D code, which is the basis of thixotropic \nmodelling by a number of workers including Modigell and Koke [84], Modigell and \nKoke [85], Ward et al. [98], Messmer [99].  \n \nModigell and Koke [84] fitted the steady state flow curve for Sn-15%Pb to a \nHerschel-Bulkley model (see Section 2 equation (2)) with a yield stress y\u03c4 dependent \non the fraction solid. The second term on the right hand side in the expression for \nshear stress (equation (19) in Table 4) includes a structural parameter \u03ba  which \n describes the current state of agglomeration but differs from \u03bb  in that it varies from \nzero (fully broken down) to infinity (fully built-up) rather than zero and one. The time \nevolution of \u03ba  is described with  first order reaction kinetics (equation (20) in Table \n4) with ( )\u03b3\uf026ba exp  the rate constant for the approach of  \u03ba  to the equilibrium value \ne\u03ba . After parameter evaluation, the model fits step-change of shear rate experiments \nwith Sn-15%Pb quite well. Simulation of die fill involved a cavity with a cylindrical \nobstacle, highlighting the different behaviour of Newtonian and thixotropic fluids (see \nFig. 27). \n \nThe equation for shear stress \u03c4  in Modigell and Koke [85] (equation (22) in Table 4) \nappears to be slightly different from that in Modigell and Koke [84] in that the yield \nstress y\u03c4 is now multiplied by the structural parameter \u03ba  and the exponential in the \nsecond term in equation (19) in Table 4 is no longer present. This may have been \nrolled into the consistency index *k  as the text states \u2018 *k  \u2026.increased exponentially \nwith the solid fraction\u2019. The experimental rheological data was for Sn-15%Pb but the \nmaterial used for die filling simulation was A356 aluminium alloy. The parameters \nused for the model were adjusted empirically during the simulation study (but are not \ngiven in the paper). Modigell and Koke found that above a critical inlet velocity the \nfilling was not laminar any more. The transition between laminar and turbulent filling \n(in the sense of a smooth flow front and one that is starting to break up) could be \nrepresented reasonably well. \n \nWard et al [98, 140, 141] found that, in modelling force versus time for a rapid \ncompression test (see Section 5.2), the implicit solver tended to give an initial peak \nregardless of whether the viscosity was Newtonian or thixotropic, especially if the \n software was allowed to choose its own time step and if the model started with a gap \nbetween the slug and the platen. Provided the time step was small enough not to be a \nfactor in determining the results, the implicit solver could reproduce the downward \nslope of the initial peak and the subsequent force profile. The explicit solver could \naccurately model shear rate jumps in a rotational viscometer (see Section 5.1) but was \ninordinately slow. FLOWSCIENCE have therefore produced a new Alternating \nDirection Implicit (ADI) solver to cope with the large ranges and changes of pressure \nassociated with thixotropic slurries.  Fig. 28 shows the ADI result for a shear rate \njump in Sn-15%Pb compared with experimental results (three repeats of the same \nexperiment) and the results from a one dimensional spread sheet calculation. The \ncontrast between implicit and explicit solvers is not mentioned elsewhere and it is not \nclear whether workers have tested their modelling against the artefacts found with the \nimplicit solver. Ward et al. [98] found that to model the shear rate jumps, an initial \nviscosity was required which was 2-5 times lower than the experimental values. This \nsuggests that the initial breakdown of the slurry is very rapid, possibly beyond the \nlimits of the viscometer data collection system, even though the system used in this \nexperimental work has the fastest data collection rate of any existing system (see \nSection 5.1 and [86]). \n \nMessmer [99] used FLOW3D to simulate thixoforging rather than thixoforming i.e. \nthe slurry is inserted directly into open dies and the parts of the die are then brought \ntogether by a ram. In simulating the thixoforging process, moving dies must therefore \nbe modelled. The apparent viscosity depends on fraction solid sf , shear rate \u03b3\uf026  and \ntime t . The fraction solid is calculated using the Scheil equation (i.e. assuming a \nsimple binary). The equilibrium viscosity is given by equation (23) in Table 4 and the \n time dependent thixotropic effects in equation (24). The viscosity parameters were \nobtained by fitting the simulation to experimental results with A356 aluminium alloy. \nComparison between forming forces, measured on the lower die at the end of the \npunch stroke, and simulated forces suggests that the initial thinning rate is much \nhigher than that in the final stages. This is consistent with the results of Ward et al. \n[98] and with the proposal by Quaak [47] that at least two different relaxation \nprocesses are operating, with different characteristic relaxation times. The die filling \nfor a suspension part was modelled where the material has to flow around a core and \nweld on the opposite side. The die was modified to ensure this welding occurred in \nthe area of the overflow as required. \n \n6.2.3 One Phase Finite Difference Based on MAGMAsoft \n \nMAGMAsoft and FLOW3D are commercial competitors in the simulation of flow \nprocesses.  It is not the intention here to discuss the relative merits of various \ncommercial codes but rather to identify how those codes have been used. Kim and \nKang [97] compared the output from MAGMAsoft with a Newtonian fluid and \nassuming the viscosity of the fluid obeyed the Ostwald-de-Waele power law with n  \nvarying between \u20130.48 and +0.45 depending on the temperature. The data for this is \nfrom MAGMAsoft. It is not clear in the text what relationship between n  and sf  is \nbeing used to obtain this temperature relationship or how this relates to the \nexperimental findings for A356 by Quaak et al. [142], who found n  values of -0.2 \nand -0.3 for solidified fractions between 0.2 and 0.4 (i.e. temperatures of 605\u02daC and \n589\u02daC respectively) and by Lou\u00e9 et al. [143] who found n  of \u20131.0 almost independent \nof temperature for temperatures between 603\u02da C and 590\u02daC. A value of n  of \u20130.2 does \n fit the curve in Fig. 15 in Kim and Kang [97] at 605\u02daC but the other values are a long \nway off. It is also of note that values of n  of less than zero imply that the shear stress \ndecreases with increasing shear rate. This is not easily explained (see discussion in \n[142] and also [61]). Notwithstanding these comments about the basis for the curve of \nn  versus temperature, the Newtonian analysis does not agree well with the \nexperimental results of partial filling experiments, whereas the results using the \nOstwald-de-Waele power law are closer to the experimental findings. \n \nSeo and Kang [100] also used MAGMAsoft, comparing the Ostwald-de-Waele power \nlaw model, which has a limited range of shear rates over which it is applicable, with \nthe Carreau-Yasuda equation, which allows viscosity at very low and very high shear \nrates to be considered. In the paper, only results of simulation with the Ostwald-de-\nWaele model are presented and show reasonable agreement with partial filling results \nfor an automotive component (but one that does not involve parting and rewelding of \nflow fronts or very big changes in section thickness). \n \n6.2.4 One Phase Finite Difference with Adstefan \n \nItamura et al. [101] compares simulation for die casting, squeeze casting and \nrheocasting for both metal flow and solidification. Few details are given. The results \nindicate that air entrapment would occur for die casting, in contrast with squeeze \ncasting and rheocasting. There would be fewer shrinkage defects in rheocasting than \nwith the other processes. \n \n6.2.5 Two Phase Finite Difference  \n  \nThere appears to be only one paper using a finite difference model for a two phase \nanalysis, that by Ilegbusi et al. [102]. The single phase equations are solved for the \nwhole filling phase. Trajectories of a given number of particles are computed, \nassuming they will \u2018disappear\u2019 when they hit a wall or are trapped in a recirculation \nzone. A measure of segregation is obtained by comparing the number of particles at a \ngiven distance from the inlet to the total number of injected particles. \n \n6.3 Finite Element Modelling \n \nThe consideration of finite element modelling is divided into one-phase and two-\nphase treatments. A number of different commercial and other codes are used.   \n \n6.3.1 One Phase Finite Element \nZavaliangos and Lawley  \nZavaliangos and Lawley [103] use identical equations to Ilegbusi and Brown [94] \nfrom the Brown et al Model (see Section 6.1) but without a yield stress. The analysis \nis for Sn-15%Pb and, for fractions solid less than about 0.5, it is predicted that a free \nstanding billet will collapse. The thixoforming of a simple shape is simulated. No \nexperimental validation of the results is given. Zavaliangos and Lawley deal with a \ntwo phase analysis in the same paper (see Section 6.3.2). \n \n Backer  \n \n Various rheological models were programmed into the WRAFTS software by Backer \n[104] including:- a Newtonian; a Herschel-Bulkley model (i.e. combining a yield \nstress with a power law-see equations (27) and (28) in Table 5); and a Bingham fluid \n(see Section 2) combined with a power law dependence (see equations (29) and (30) \nin Table 5). Note that it is not clear that the description of \u201ca Bingham fluid combined \nwith a power law dependence\u201d is correct here as there is no yield stress in equation \n(30) but rather one term dependent on \u03b3\uf026  and one on n\u03b3\uf026 . An internal variable model is \nalso used (viz. Brown et al in Section 6.1). In this the structural parameter \u03bb  (which \nvaries between 0 and 100% rather than 0 and 1) is perceived as a chemical \nconcentration and a convective transport equation is written for its spatial and \ntemporal variation (equation (31) in Table 5). When this equation is simplified by \nassuming the fluid density is constant and the velocity does not vary spatially, it can \nbe compared to that due to Barkhudarov et al. [95]. There is a strong similarity but \nwith a factor of 2\u03bb  in the second term on the right hand side rather than \u03bb  as in \nequation (15) in Table 4. This reduces the contribution of disagglomeration. \n \nWith the Newtonian rheological model, due to the relatively low viscosity of the \nliquid metal, there are a number of locations behind cores in a complex die that \nremain unfilled while the liquid flows past them. Such locations would increase gas \nentrapment and would show flow lines in a casting. For the power law rheological \nmodel, the fluid fills behind the cores. With the internal variable model, a larger \npercentage of the flow into the cavity arises from the runner at the side of the die \ncavity, in contrast with the Newtonian and Bingham\/power law models which predict \na larger flow rate from the bottom runner. The reason for the larger flow rate from the \nside runner is that the structural parameter (\u2018agglomeration variable\u2019) \u03bb  is reduced as \n the mixture flows through the runner system from a maximum value of 100% in the \nshot sleeve to less than 20% at the end of the side runner. The value at the bottom \nrunner is 40%; thus, the material in the side runner is less viscous and can flow into \nthe cavity more readily. Experimental validation is not presented in the paper. \n \n Alexandrou, Burgos and co-workers \n \nThere are several papers by Alexandrou, Burgos and co-workers [105-109,114] \nsometimes with Alexandrou and Burgos working together and sometimes in \ncooperation with others. The papers have similar threads running through and \ntherefore are treated together here.  \n \nIn [105], Alexandrou et al. use the commercial code PAMCASTSIMULOR to \ncompare Newtonian and Bingham filling of a three-dimensional cavity with a core. \nThe yield stress y\u03c4  is a function of the fraction solid sf . Temperature dependence is \nintroduced through this relationship.  Equations (33) and (34) in Table 5 give the \nviscous stress tensor and the viscosity expression. IID  is the second invariant of the \ndeformation rate tensor. In simple shear, \u03b3\uf026=2\/IID . When the local stress is larger \nthan y\u03c4 , the slurry behaves as a Non-newtonian fluid. m controls the exponential rise \nin the stress at small rates of strain and, depending on the value of the power law \ncoefficient n , the behaviour is either shear thinning ( 1<n ) or shear thickening \n( 1>n ). The continuous Bingham law in equation (33) is based on that introduced by \nPapanastasiou [131] to avoid the discontinuity at the yield stress. In [105], the value \nof n  is taken to be 1. In the simulation, firstly pipe flow was studied, demonstrating \nthat the flow at the outlet was identical with the analytical solution. Due to the finite \n yield stress, the Bingham case shows a large unyielded area where the material in the \ncentre flows like a solid. For a three dimensional cavity with a cylindrical core, there \nis a strong contrast between Newtonian and Bingham behaviour (Fig.29).  In the \nNewtonian case, the velocity vectors at the rewelding front (i.e. where flow fronts \nmust remerge beyond a core) point towards the core, whereas in the Bingham case, \nthey point away from the core, allowing oxide skins to be transported into overflows. \n \nBurgos and Alexandrou [106] examined the flow development of Herschel-Bulkley \nfluids in a sudden three dimensional square expansion, using again the Papanastasiou \nmodel [131]. The results show that during the evolution of flow, two core regions and \ndead zones at the corners are formed. The extent of the core regions decreases with \nthe pressure gradient and the Reynolds number and increases with the power-law \nindex. \n \nThe relative importance of the inertial, viscous and yield stress effects on the filling \nprofile in a two-dimensional cavity with a Bingham fluid is examined in Alexandrou \net al [107]. The analysis is as for the previous two papers. The results identify five \ndifferent flow patterns (see Fig. 30): \u2018shell\u2019 (large Reynolds numbers but small \nBingham numbers), \u2018mound\u2019 (low Reynolds and Bingham numbers), \u2018bubble\u2019 (larger \nBingham numbers), \u2018disk\u2019 (occurs between shell and bubble filling), and \u2018transition\u2019. \nThese can be plotted using the Saint-Venant number, (which is defined as the ratio of \nthe Bingham number VHy \u03b7\u03c4 \/  to the Reynolds number \u03b7\u03c1 \/VH , where H  and V  \nare characteristic length and velocity scales), which indicates the importance of the \nyield stress relative to the inertia forces, and the Reynolds number (see Fig. 31). This \nis a very helpful approach to schematising the different types of behaviour, \n particularly in identifying the vulnerability to defects. Transition flow occupies a \nnarrow region between the disk and bubble patterns. Since the flow initially starts as \ndisk and then switches to bubble filling, this region may be prone to instabilities. \n \nIn Burgos et al [108], the Herschel-Bulkley model in equation (33) in Table 5 and the \napproach of the previous papers [105-107] is expanded to include the effect of the \nevolution of microstructure via an equation for t\u2202\u2202\u03bb  very similar to equation (15) in \nTable 4 [95] but including an exponential factor in the second term on the right hand \nside (i.e. the disagglomeration term). This exponential dependence is included to \naccount for the fact that experimentally [e.g. 80-82, 86] the shear stress evolution for \nshear-rate step-up experiments is faster than that for the step-down case. (It is not \nclear why this is not taken into account by the constants a and b or whether this is, in \nfact, a way of introducing two relaxation processes as in Quaak [47]). In addition, the \nyield stress, consistency index K  and power law index n  are now all assumed to be \nfunctions of the volume fraction solid sf  and the structural parameter \u03bb . There are \nthen six material parameters in the model: ( ) ( ) ( )\u03bb\u03c4\u03bb\u03bb ,,,,,,,, syss ffnfKcba . Burgos \net al. [108] obtain these using data on Sn-15%Pb from Modigell et al. [133]. The \nbehaviour of the material is shear thickening for isostructure during a shear rate jump. \nThe power law index decreases with the structural parameter while the consistency \nindex and the yield stress increase. For flow through a straight square channel, \ndisagglomeration is small in the corners and in the core region of the channel. \n \nAlexandrou et al [109] analysed a simple compression test assuming a Bingham fluid \nand not taking account of the evolution of the internal structure. The viscosity and \n yield stress were obtained from fitting a load versus time curve. There is unyielded \nmaterial at the top and at the bottom of the compressed cylinder, in stagnant layers. \n \nThe identification of flow regimes prone to instabilities in [107] has led to a more \nrecent paper (Alexandrou et al [114]) analysing two dimensional jets of Bingham and \nHerschel-Bulkley fluids impacting on a vertical surface at a distance from the die \nentrance. A bubble pattern gives an unstable jet, whereas shell, disk and mound are all \nstable, along with most transition cases. Instabilities are the result of finite yield stress \nand the way yielded and unyielded regions interact. Plots of Bingham number versus \nReynolds number identify stable and unstable regions. This identification of \ninstability provides an important explanation of the common defect in semi-solid \nprocessing sometimes termed the \u2018toothpaste effect\u2019 (Fig. 32) \n  \n Viscoplastic Constitutive Models \nDing et al. [110] established a rigid viscoplastic constitutive model for AlSi7Mg alloy \nthrough compression tests. They neglected the flow stress during the initial \nbreakdown stage and only fitted the flow stress in the steady state. In the simulation, \nthey assumed that the deformation of semi-solid materials is governed by the Levy-\nMises flow rule. They used DEFORM-3D software with a six-fingered die heated to \nthe initial temperature of the billet, i.e. the conditions are quasi-isothermal. The die \nfingers are of different cross-sectional areas. It appears from the diagrams that the \nmaterial is initially in position in the die and is then compressed by the punch. Metal \nin the larger orifice fingers flows faster, contrary to what would be expected with \nthixotropic breakdown. The simulation and the experimental results agree well but \n there is no analysis of whether liquid phase has segregated out from the solid, and \nwhether it is this which is giving the results which are contrary to expectations. \n \nRassili et al. [112] also obtained a viscoplastic constitutive model from force \nrecordings of extrusion tests. Their simulation is aimed at thixoforging steels. There is \nno time dependence in the constitutive equation (equation (49) in Table 5) in contrast \nwith the Ding et al. equation (46) in Table 5 which does include a \u03b3\uf026  term. This is \ntherefore essentially a forging simulation. The friction is assumed to be very low. \nThere are several combinations possible for the tool displacement. If the ejector goes \nup and the punch starts to go down when the ejector stops, buckling occurs and leads \nto a lap. If the punch and ejector move simultaneously, or the punch goes down first \nand then the ejector goes up, the buckling disappears but a lap is formed on each \u2018ear\u2019 \nof the part. The simulation agrees reasonably with a lead prototype but thixoforging \nresults with steel are not presented. \n \n Power Law Cut-Off  (PLCO) Model of Procast \n \nJahajeeah et al. [111] and Orgeas et al [115] have both used the Power Law Cut Off \n(PLCO) model in Procast commercial software [134]. The major assumption of the \nPLCO model is that the material is a purely viscous isotropic, incompressible fluid. \nThe versions used are slightly different. In the Jahajeeah et al. work, the demonstrator \ncomponent is divided into different regions each with different cut-off values 0\u03b3\uf026 . It is \nnot clear how these values are determined. If 0\u03b3\u03b3 \uf026\uf026 \u2264  then \nn\n00\u03b3\u03b7\u03b7 \uf026= , whereas if 0\u03b3\u03b3 \uf026\uf026 >  \nthen n\u03b3\u03b7\u03b7 \uf0260= i.e. shear thinning is only occurring if the cut-off value is exceeded. If it \nis not exceeded, the viscosity is not affected by local shearing and is calculated using \n 0\u03b3\uf026 . There is reasonable agreement between the simulation and the results of \ninterrupted filling tests with A356 aluminium alloy. With less than optimum runner \ndesign, defects are predicted and these were found in the identified areas in practice. \n \nIn the work by Orgeas et al. [115], there is only one value of the cut-off 0\u03b3\uf026  and this is \ndetermined by geometry. The shear rate cut-off 0\u03b3\uf026  was initially used in finite element \ncodes to improve numerical convergence for shear thinning materials ( 1<n ) when the \nshear rate decreased towards zero. Orgeas et al. adopt a different point of view. \nFirstly, they assume that agglomeration and coalescence of grains probably does not \ntake place over the very short injection times characteristic of thixoforming. \nTherefore, a decrease of \u03b3\uf026  will not lead to an increase of the viscosity \u03b7 . Secondly, a \nsudden increase of the shear rate \u03b3\uf026  will lead to a decrease in viscosity. In effect, an \nincrease of \u03b3\uf026  beyond the largest shear rate 0\u03b3\uf026  experienced so far will lead to a \ndecrease in viscosity (and modify the maximum shear rate 0\u03b3\uf026 ). A decrease of \u03b3\uf026  \nbelow 0\u03b3\uf026  will not modify the viscosity (and leaves 0\u03b3\uf026  unchanged). This \u2018ratchet-\ntype\u2019 behaviour could be fully modelled, but in the work by Orgeas et al. they have \nassumed only one value of 0\u03b3\uf026  because their experiments involve a transition between \na shot sleeve and a small injection aperture and most of the change in viscosity is \noccurring at that point. The calculation of the value of 0\u03b3\uf026  is given in the paper. \n \nOrgeas et al. obtain the parameters for their model from experiments measuring the \npressures and temperatures in a tube with a shaft in it. They then use the model to \nsimulate the filling of a reservoir. Comparison between the simulations and \ninterrupted filling experiments for A356 aluminium alloy are shown in Fig. 33. It \n should be noted that Orgeas et al. found eutectic-rich concentric rings in the tube in a \nPoiseuille type experiment (Fig. 34(a)). These were due to veins of liquid formed in \nthe shot sleeve as a result of mechanical instabilities generated in a solid skeleton \nwhich is not uniformly sheared (see Fig. 34). The vein of eutectic liquid at 45\u02da was \ndue to the \u2018dead\u2019 zone at the bottom right corner of the shot sleeve i.e. a zone which is \nalmost not sheared and only compressed. The compression of the dead zone induces a \n\u2018sponge-like\u2019 effect. Such complex behaviour cannot be predicted with a one-phase \nmodel. It should be noted that this highlights the need for such dead zones to be \navoided in die design for semi-solid processing. \n \nModel Based on Viscoelasticity and Thixotropy \n \nWahlen [113] presents a model based on viscoeleasticity and thixotropy.  Thixotropic \nmaterials do not normally display viscoelasticity. It would seem that this could only \nreally occur if the fraction solid is relatively high. In equation (30) in Table 5, the first \nterm in brackets is the viscoelastic term and the last term in brackets is essentially a \ncreep term. It is not clear why these terms have been multiplied rather than being \ntreated as additive. There is good agreement between the model and the curve of flow \nstress versus true strain but this is for a temperature of 570\u02daC where the A356 would \nbe expected to be almost fully solid (see Differential Scanning Calorimetry data in \n[59]). The simulation results are compared with backward extrusion samples for \nvarious temperatures. There is a transition at around 570\u02daC,  which is interpreted as \nthe transition between plastic deformation of a connected-particle network and the \nviscous flow of a suspension of solid particles. \n \n 6.3.2.Two Phase Finite Element \nSome of the two-phase finite element modelling papers are presented in Table 6 but \nthat approach is less useful when the equations are so complex. (Gebelin et al. [144] \nhave presented a useful mathematical comparison of one phase and two phase \napproaches). Others are discussed here in a more general background section. Orgeas \net al. [115] have reviewed two-phase approaches. In the two-phase models, the \nsemisolid material is considered as a saturated two-phase medium i.e. made of the \nliquid and solid phases. Each phase has its own behaviour, which can be influenced \nby the presence of the other phase via interfacial contributions. The conservation \nequations can be written within a mixture theory background [145] and the solid \nphase (solid skeleton) can be modelled as a purely viscous and compressive medium \n[146,147]. Momentum exchanges between the solid and the Newtonian liquid are \nhandled by a Darcy-type term appearing in the momentum equations [148]. These \nmodels are able to predict phase separation [e.g.118,149]. However, the determination \nof the rheological parameters which are required is not straightforward [e.g. 146, \n147]. Two-phase models also usually require the simultaneous calculation of a solid \nfraction field, a pressure field, two velocity fields (for the liquid and the solid) and a \ntemperature field (although in most cases the simulation is isothermal). Such \nsimulations therefore require very high computation time. \n \nThe distinctive features of the papers identified in Table 6 are as follows: \n\uf0a7 Zavaliangos [116] The degree of cohesion is represented by an internal \nvariable which evolves with deformation (cf. the internal variable in the \nBrown et al. Model [127-129] in Section 6.1). The permeability equation \n implies that solid-liquid segregation decreases as the grain size decreases. \nBehaviour is not symmetric under tension and compression. \n\uf0a7 Koke et al. [117]: The solid phase is assumed to be a pseudo-fluid with a \nHerschel-Bulkley viscosity. \n\uf0a7 Kang and Kung [118] treated the solid phase as compressible and introduced a \nseparation coefficient expressing the actual separation of the particles in \nrelation to their initial separation. The higher the strain rate the more \nhomogeneous the distribution of the solid fraction. In compression forming, \nmacroscopic phase segregation occurred with densification of the remaining \nsolid in the central region. \n\uf0a7 Binet and Pineau [119] adopt a mixture approach where the hydrodynamic \npart is the same as for most incompressible CFD codes but the velocity field \nrepresents the velocities of the mixture. A source term is added to the \nmomentum equations to take account of the diffusion velocities of the \nindividual phases. \n\uf0a7 Choi et al. [120] The solid is assumed to be viscoplastic. Kuhn\u2019s yield \ncriterion is used for the solid phase. (i.e. behaviour is symmetric for tension \nand compression and the hydrostatic component of stress is included). \n\uf0a7 Yoon et al. [122] used Von Mises yield criterion (i.e. symmetric in tension and \ncompression). The semisolid is treated as a single incompressible phase. \n\uf0a7 Kopp and Horst [123] adopt the Drucker-Prager yield criterion (i.e. non-\nsymmetric in tension and compression). \n\uf0a7 Modigell et al. [124] use the pseudo-fluid approach for the solid phase [117]. \nAll the non-Newtonian properties of the material are shifted to the solid phase \nand the liquid is treated as Newtonian. Two-dimensional contour maps \n showing the transitions between laminar, transient and full turbulent filling are \nplotted (Fig.35). The dimensionless groups used for this mapping are not \ngiven in detail in this short paper. The three-dimensional process window for \nA356 aluminium alloy, based on laminar filling, is also identified (Fig.36). \nThese results are highly significant. \n \n6.3.3 Micro-Modelling \n \nRouff et al. [125] present a novel and interesting approach. Spherical inclusions (i.e. \nparticles) containing entrapped liquid are assumed to deform very little and can slip \nrelative to each other if the restriction between them is released. They are surrounded \nby solid bonds and the \u2018not entrapped\u2019 liquid where deformation generally takes \nplace. This \u2018active zone\u2019, associated with the strain localization, is gathered in a layer \nsurrounding the inclusions (Fig. 37). The volume solid fraction of the active zone, sAf , \nis the internal variable. During deformation, the bonds are broken and liquid is \nreleased. Thus, the bimodal liquid-solid distribution changes with the strain rate. Both \nthe liquid and the solid are assumed isotropic and incompressible. The liquid and solid \nare then embedded in a homogeneous equivalent medium having the effective \nproperties of the inclusion or the active zone. The viscosity of each inclusion and the \nviscosity of the active zone can then be determined and the effective viscosity of the \nsemi-solid is a mixture of these. This approach enables very accurate prediction of the \nviscosity of Sn-15%Pb as a function of shear rate and shows great promise for further \ndevelopment. \n \n \n 7. Flow Visualisation \n \nVirtually all the experimental validation of die filling patterns reported in Section 6 \ninvolves interrupted filling. The difficulty with this is that the effects of inertia \ncompromise the results, with the material continuing to travel even when the ram has \nstopped. The most appropriate way of checking the position of the flow front during \ndie fill is with in situ observation. The main recent work with transparent sided dies is \nthat by Petera et al.[150] and Ward et al. [98]. Petera et al. [150] use a T-shaped die, \ncovered with a glass plate on one side. The die is integrated into an oven to ensure \nthat conditions are isothermal. Experiments have been carried out with Sn-12%Pb. \nThe effect of piston velocity on the flow front is shown in Fig.38. At low piston \nvelocity (Fig.38 (a)), no detachment of material from the walls of the die could be \nobserved. At much higher piston velocity (Fig.38(c)), there is significant detachment, \nwith the potential to form cavities in the final product. Ward et al. [98] established an \narrangement which could be used with both SnPb and with aluminium alloys. Various \nobstacle shapes were placed in the path of the flowing material to observe flow fronts \nremerging. Fig.39 illustrates the results for Sn15%Pb and Fig.40 for A357 aluminium \nalloy. The die entrance was either parallel sided or splayed. Obstacles included \ncylinders of various diameters and \u2018spiders\u2019 used in the manufacture of PVC pipe. \nRemerging was sensitive to ram velocity and obstacle shape. \n \n8. Concluding Remarks \nThe main focus for this review has been the modelling of semisolid processing. As \nbackground for that, routes to spheroidal microstructures, types of semi-solid \nprocessing and the advantages and disadvantages have been summarised. \n Groundwork on rheology and the origins of thixotropy have been laid and \nmathematical theories of thixotropy introduced. Experimental data for input into \nmodelling is crucial and depends on measuring behaviour during rapid transients, \neither through rapid shear rate jumps in rheometers or through rapid compression \ntesting. The review of modelling has then been divided into those models based on \nfinite difference methods and those based on finite element. In addition, some models \nare one-phase and some are two-phase. Papers on modelling are summarised in Tables \n4, 5 and 6 and in the text are dealt with in sections, grouped together where there is \ncommon ground. \n \nThere are a multiplicity of approaches to the modelling of semisolid forming. What \nemerges clearly here is the lack of quantitative measures of the accuracy of the results \nand a lack of direct means of comparison. There is also a serious need for more \nrheological data, both for Sn-15%Pb (the classic \u2018model\u2019 alloy for semisolid \nthixotropic studies), for aluminium alloys used in commercial forming, and for other \nmaterials such as steels where there is significant interest in commercial use. This \nrheological data is difficult to obtain and great care has to be taken to avoid artefacts \nand to ensure the data is appropriate for the application. For example, thixoforming is \nessentially a rapid transient rather than a steady state process. Despite these \ndifficulties, accurate modelling can be a great aid in die design, predicting appropriate \nprocessing conditions and minimising defects. The recent development of \u2018maps\u2019 by \nAlexandrou and co-workers [114] and by Modigell et al. [124] is highly significant in \nthis respect.  \n   \n \n  \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with Professors A C F Cocks and A \nR S Ponter at the University of Leicester, and with my co-workers Drs P J Ward, T Y \nLiu, S B Chin and D H Kirkwood at the University of Sheffield.
