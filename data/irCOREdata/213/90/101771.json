Design and simulation data are provided for\na prototype antenna working at 5 GHz. The antenna provides a\nhigh quality CP wave, and the structure is partially suitable for\nincorporating in multilayer microwave circuits.\nIndex Terms\u2014Circular polarization, microstrip antennas, trav-\neling-wave feed.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nC IRCULAR polarization is a key feature of many existingand developing mobile communication systems. More-\nover, many such systems require the antenna to be closely\nintegrated with the other transceiver circuitry. In this paper,\nwe propose a new technique, which is capable of yielding\nhigh quality circular polarization, with a feeding system that\nis particularly suitable for integration in a multilayer circuit.\nThis type of circuit, fabricated either in thick-film or LTCC,\nis attractive because it can provide a combination of high-per-\nformance and low-cost fabrication.\nThe proposed traveling-wave feed system offers a number of\nadvantages over other rear-fed patch techniques that have been\nreported in the literature [1]. It does not require a probe through\nthe dielectric layer beneath the patch and it does not require a\nresonant aperture beneath the patch.\nThe current work is an extension of the concept of using a\nslotline to excite a single patch wave, that was previously re-\nported in the literature [2].\nIn order to establish the validity of the proposed technique, a\nprototype 5-GHz antenna was designed and tested. Data are pre-\nsented that compare the measured and simulated performance of\nthis antenna.\nII. ANTENNA STRUCTURE\nFig. 1 shows the geometry of the proposed CP antenna.\nThe structure is composed of four planar rectangular radiating\npatches each with dimensions and , where is the\nresonant dimension for the fundamental mode and is the\noptimum width [3] to give good radiation from each patch.\nEach patch is linearly polarized, but because there is an annular\nspacing of between the patches they will be successively\nexcited 90 out of phase. This will lead to circular polarization.\nThis concept was originally established by Huang [4] using\nManuscript received June 24, 2004; revised September 10, 2004.

Mrozowski.\nThe authors are with the University of Surrey, Surrey GU2 7XH, U.K. (e-mail:\nk.lum@eim.surrey.ac.uk).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/LMWC.2005.844218\nFig. 1.

A circular slot-\nline channel, of width , runs in the ground plane beneath the\npatches [5], [6]. The test antenna was fabricated on RT\/Duroid\n5870 having the following parameters: substrate thickness,\nmm; substrate dielectric constant, ; 0.5-oz\nelectro-deposited copper. The circuit was fed from 50- mi-\ncrostrip. However, the width of the slotline channel, , would\nbe very small to give a characteristic impedance of 50 and so,\nto avoid etching problems, the impedance of the slotline was\nincreased to 110 so that a wider channel could be used. Two,\ntwo-section quarter-wave microstrip transformers were used to\nconvert the microstrip line impedance from 50 to 110 [7].\nIt should be noted that since the slot is still relatively narrow,\nand the slotline is matched, there would not be significant\nradiation from the slotline.\nThus the key antenna dimensions were\nmm\nmm\nmm\nThe mean diameter of the circular slotline channel was\n80.150 mm so as to give the correct 4 spacing between\nadjacent patches. Photographs of the upper and lower surfaces\nof the antenna are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.\nIII. THEORY\nThe slot line was excited through a conventional mi-\ncrostrip-to-slotline transition [8], [9].

Photograph of the ground plane of the antenna, showing the slotline\nchannel.\ntraveling in the slotline will successively excite each patch, pro-\nviding that the slotline is offset from the center of the patch. The\namount of offset will determine the amount of coupling. In this\ncase an offset of 2 mm was chosen to give minimal coupling\nto each patch, so that each patch would receive approximately\nthe same signal. In future designs the amount of offset could be\nvaried to compensate for the progressive loss of signal in the\nslotline.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe antenna was simulated using Agilent\u2019s ADS software.\nMeasurements were made using an Agilent 8510 Network An-\nalyzer. As shown in Fig. 4, the measured return loss agrees well\nwith the simulated response. It is below 10 dB from 4.6 GHz\nto 5.2 GHz.\nFig. 4. Return loss of the traveling-wave circularly polarized planar antenna.\nFig. 5. Measured circular polarization (plot of variation of strength of E-field\nas a function of angle of rotation at a distance of 1.5 m from antenna) of the\ntraveling-wave circularly polarized planar antenna. [Referring to Figs. 2 and 3,\nthe polarization plot was taken in the XY -plane, with Z =1.5 m].\nFig. 5 shows the measured circular polarization of the antenna\narray at 4.86 GHz. It was found that an adequate combination of\ngood return loss and a good circular polarization existed over a\n6% bandwidth. It is apparent that good circular polarization ex-\nists and the key performance of the circuit has been established.\nFor this prototype antenna, the same slotline offset was used\nfor each patch, and no attempt was made to match the slotline\nbetween patches. Some further improvement to the results could\nbe obtained by introducing a variable offset as previously de-\nscribed, together with inter-patch impedance matching in the\nslotline. Also, efficiency has not been considered in this pro-\ntotype design, which was intended merely to demonstrate the\nprinciple. In future work it is intended to control the amount of\nenergy coupled to each patch so as to minimize the energy dis-\nsipated in the impedance terminating the slotline.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe concept of a novel circularly polarized microstrip array\nusing a traveling-wave feed system has been established through\npractical measurement. High quality circular polarization was\ndemonstrated with very good agreement between the measured\nand simulated return loss of the antenna. The proposed structure\nis particularly suitable for inclusion in highly integrated multi-\nlayer transceivers.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
