Introduction\nThe principles of Asset Health Management (AHM) through maintenance protocols (preventive,\npredictive, reactive, condition-based and reliability-centred), operational procedures and\/or\ngeneric asset health management protocols are well established. Further, the strategy of\ncontinuously monitoring the mechanical and\/or material integrity and condition of critical assets\n(machines, structures, etc), referred to as Condition Monitoring (CM), has been the fundamental\nbackbone of many of these protocols over the last 30 years and includes data collection for Key\nPerformance Indicators (KPIs), evaluation and diagnostics across many industries.\nWhen assessing the condition or health of a given asset, it is normal to understand the expected\nmodes of failure and to set up a monitoring scheme that identifies changes, which are known to\nlead to the initiation of a known failure mode. The objective of CM programmes is to ensure\nsafety, optimise the machines efficiency of energy conversion, maximise product yield while\nminimising energy and product wastage. This is also the primary objective of Overall Equipment\nEfficiency (OEE) driven industries. Equally, these objectives result in optimised useful life times\nand improve the assets Whole Life Cycle Cost (WLCC) beyond its design life (see section 4)[1-\n4]. CM parameters, their trending and modelling are not only critical to commercial efficiency,\nprofitability and \u2018Return-on-Investment (ROI), but they are also critical to the global\nenvironment, since the challenge to the environment is the waste from inefficient asset and\nprocesses in industry.\n- 3 -\n2. Condition monitoring\nThe CM technologies used in these maintenance protocols include Vibration analysis (VA),\nAcoustic Emission (AE), Infrared Thermography (IRT) and lubrication management (LM) [5].\nThe latter includes Oil and wear debris analysis. More fundamental methods for process\nperformance monitoring (measurement of process parameters) includes pressure, temperature,\nspeed, flow rates, etc, which are often used together with the more advanced methods in large\nasset maintenance, such as in ships [6,7], petrochemical platforms or manufacturing plants. The\nuse of any of these technologies, singularly or integrated, would be employed to monitor the\nperformance and integrity of an asset in any OEE programme.\n3. The environment\nWith regard to standards, the environment, and the current development of CM technologies and\ntheir associated International standards (ISO), interest has begun at a time of global relevance.\nThis is vindicated by the acceptance of, and commitment to, the Kyoto protocol by many\ncountries and companies concerned with global warming and their \u2018carbon footprint\u2019, together\nwith the proliferation of engineering and CM standards from the international community (ISO) .\nThe public is also becoming increasingly concerned about global warming, recognising that it is\nthe production of waste material like carbon dioxide and waste energy that is the main cause of\nthis problem. Part of the problem is the demand from society for transportation, heating and\nrefuse disposal. People as individuals can help to limit the stress on the environment by\nminimising their demand on refuse disposal, energy and material products, thus reducing their\ncarbon footprint; but the majority of carbon loading to the atmosphere is from the burning of\n- 4 -\nfossil fuels to supply energy to the power, transport, building and industrial sectors [8]. The latter\nis of particular concern since much of the world\u2019s engineering infrastructure has exceeded, or is\nin the process of exceeding, its design life. For example, an unfortunate consequence of aged\nassets, for instance, was the recent leakage of a \u2018British Petroleum\u2019 (BP) stretch of pipeline and\nthe recent closure of one its largest oilfields in the US in August 2006 due to pipeline leakage.\nWhat ever the cause, the overall concern is always \u2018what is the carbon footprint\u2019. To address this\nconcern the UK government has always supported the framework for action outlined by the\nKyoto Protocol, through initiatives managed by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The\nDTI White paper [9] published in February 2003, considers a cross-departmental approach to\nenergy policy and emphasises the importance of climate change considerations in overall energy\npolicy in the UK. Such importance was re-iterated by Stern [10] more recently. The development\nand implementation of action plans to deliver the emission targets and the monitoring of\nperformance is coordinated by the Sustainable Energy Policy Network (SEPN) at the DTI. There\nare several government programmes, of which the office of the Climate Change Programme\n(CCP) [9] at the DTI is one. This office sets out a strategic package of policies and measures\nacross all industry sectors by working in partnership with key stakeholders. The benefits and\nmeasures of the CCP include amongst many:\na. Improved energy efficiency\nb. Lower costs for businesses\nc. Less fuel poverty\nThese key measures are common to the overall objectives of any condition monitoring\nmaintenance or AHM programme. Further key objectives at the CCP include:\nx To stimulate new and more efficient and renewable sources of power generation such\nas wind power, whereby 10% of power is to come from these new sources by 2010.\nCondition monitoring technologies of VA, LM and AE are being used to monitor\n- 5 -\noperational performance parameters of these wind farms to optimise energy output\nand reduce public concerns for noise in the environment. AE and VA are leading the\nresearch and development of this technology to improve their efficiency even further.\nx Improvement of the energy efficiency within buildings as required within the UK\nbuilding regulations. The new UK Building Regulations for air-tightness of new\nbuildings was published in 2005. The condition monitoring technology of IRT will\nassist this technology to monitor its performance, but has been used for many years\nthroughout the world to monitor all building types for energy-leakage and damage to\nstructures.\nThe overall concern of these governmental bodies is Climate change. This climate change results\nfrom greenhouse-gas emissions associated with economic activities across a range of industrial\nand commercial sectors. These emissions are not limited to just carbon dioxide, but also include\nmethane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride from\nmany industrial waste and effluent streams. The full cost of such emissions to date will only be\nrealised in several years and the impact on the environment, financial and social structures can\nonly be postulated [10]. However, consensus is that the atmospheric loading over the past 20\nyears is responsible for the environmental changes today. The loading to the atmosphere from\ntoday\u2019s activities will influence the changes suffered in the next few decades.\nWhat is clear is that the consequence of climate change will become disproportionately more\ndamaging with increasing emissions. Policies proposed to begin to stem the levels of emission\ninclude the Carbon budget. This budget has the objective to reduce the participant\u2019s carbon\nfootprint. The larger your footprint, the more tax you pay. Whilst the process of meeting locally\nset targets by individual governments is on-going, there are also international negotiations on\n- 6 -\nsetting target emission based on climate change, whereby the concepts of \u2018emissions trading\u2019 and\n\u2018emissions allocation\u2019 are being considered. Many countries are already subject to an emissions\nallocation, while many companies are participating in emissions trading. This is a carbon budget\non an international scale, where carbon credits are allocated for certain activities (e.g., carbon\nuptake by tree stock owned by the company) to counter balance carbon emissions to yield your\ncarbon footprint.\nTo help monitor this policy the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) was launched in April\n2002, together with the UK National Allocation Plan (NAP), to support the European\nCommunities Emissions Trading Scheme (EUETS) in 2005. At present companies not only have\nto strive to meet their emission targets, but also must find ways to budget their carbon load to\nsatisfy the EUETS and pay any outstanding carbon levies. Consequently, the real value of\ncondition monitoring surveillance and testing data within most engineering industries towards\nimproved energy and production efficiency, energy management, and OEE is generally\nunderstated or misunderstood. Without a measure of performance and improvement, the final\ncarbon levy debt will be based on inaccurate models that assess the carbon balance in the\nsustainability loops for each asset.\n4. An integrated strategy\nInformation related to production efficiency, production costs, material costs, service costs,\nenergy consumption and losses, waste and life cycle of components and systems and the Whole\nLife Cycle Cost (WLCC) of asset, and CM and performance test data are input parameters to\nintegrated AHM (IAHM) strategies. Each component in the sustainability loop of each asset\nwithin a system is optimised by the efficiency of the associated CM maintenance programme that\n- 7 -\nserves it. The WLCC component of such an integrated strategy [4] is a holistic view of \u2018whole\nlife\u2019 cost analysis that is \u2018from the cradle to the grave\u2019. The primary aim of WLCC is to aid\ncapital investment decisions on long-term costs of assets. The KPIs in a WLCC framework\nincludes: maintenance, services, component deterioration rates, asset operational costs, service\nlife of components and ratio of maintenance cost to capital cost; all of which are measured via\nCM and diagnostic protocols. CM actually optimises these parameters and contributes to the\n\u2018estimated service life (ESLC) parameter, defined by equation (1):\nESLC = RSLC * A * B * C * D * E * F (1)\nWhere RSLC is the \u2018reference service life\u2019 [or design life], A= material\/component factor, B=\ndesign factor, C= workmanship factor, D= in use (operator) factor, E= external environment\nfactor and F= maintenance factor. Condition monitoring also influences A and F factors. This\nrelationship, equation (2), for ESLC is the basic Monte Carlo simulation equation:\nY = Y(o)*D(x)*C(x)*Q(x)*B(x)*M(x) (2)\nWhich generates a probability distribution for Y= ESLC over time (x). In a service life model\nthese parameters are sometimes weighted then normalised to facilitate the calculation of an\noverall \u2018remaining service life\u2019 using weighted averages. With a Markov processing of these data\na condition rating transition probability [4] can be determined, which then interfaces into a\nWLCC model. With no condition monitoring, the factors A, D and E will dominate the system\nand they will be much less than optimal. Further, with no CM, an asset would likely suffer\nincreased downtime and breakdowns, reducing the life cycle below its design life. The carbon\nbudget from this less efficient asset would be incorrect if a generalised assumed model was to be\n- 8 -\nused, as a higher proportion of energy would be lost and carbon emitted.. The sensitivity on the\nintroduction and level of a Carbon price on exhaustible resources such as oil has been noted [10].\nThe final integrated strategy developed would be required to assist industry in implementing\nincremental and step changes in the way we live, in order for \u2018decarbonisation\u2019 of the built\nenvironment to be realised permanently. The integrated strategy must also include estimation of\nembodied carbon and the carbon footprint of all products and services.\n5. International Standards\nThe establishment of international technical standards for the CM technologies [5, 11] and a\nconformity standard for the certification of CM personnel who collect and manage the data [12],\nensures that the data collected and KPIs measured are accurate and reliable using approved\nprocedures [11-14]. The industries collecting the data would also benefit from a standardised\nqualification scheme specifying these technical standards.\nOver the past decade the international standards community has been developing engineering,\ncondition monitoring and qualification standards that specify the requirements for qualification of\nCM personnel for 3rd party based certification and 2nd party declaration. This standard is the\nISO18436 suite [parts 1 to 7] of standards [11] that specifies the technical requirements in the\nfollowing parts:\nx Part 2- for Vibration Analysis testing\nx Part 4 and 5- for lubricant testing [Field and laboratory]\nx Part 6 for Acoustic Emission testing\nx Part 7 for Thermography testing\n- 9 -\nThe requirements of the 3rd party certifying body are defined in ISO17024 [14]. In order to\nfacilitate these standards for testing personnel into industry, a 3rd party accredited certifying body\nis required to manage the process.\n6. The BINDT certification scheme\nThe unknown quality of training and lack of confidence in testing personnel competency, with a\nlack of standardisation for CM personnel, has long been issues of concern in many safety-critical\nindustries. To address this concern, as requested by the UK industry, the British Institute of Non-\nDestructive Testing (BINDT) has developed a certification scheme for CM personnel [5] that is\naccredited by the UK Accreditation Service [UKAS], that conforms with ISO18436 and\nISO17024. BINDT approves examination bodies in accordance with ISO17024 and ISO18436-1,\nand accredits training bodies in accordance with ISO18436-3. ISO17024 requires a management\nstructure similar to that shown in Figure 1, where:\nAE \u2013 Acoustic Emission; VA \u2013 Vibration analysis; IRT \u2013 Infrared thermography; LM \u2013\nlubrication management (Oil \/ Wear analysis); RTC \u2013 Remote Training centre; BSI \u2013 British\nStandards Institute; ATO \u2013 Accredited Training Organisation; Technical \u2013 Condition Monitoring\nand Diagnostics Technology committee; CMC \u2013Certification Management Committee\n- 10 -\nFigure 1 The BINDT CM structure\nISO\nAccreditation\nBody\nCertification\nBSI\nEFNDT\nAccrediting\npanel\nATO\nRTC\nTechnical\nIRTVA\nAELM\nCMC\nAEC\nBINDT\n- 11 -\n7. Case Studies of Acoustic Emission monitoring in an integrated strategy\nThe two case studies presented indicate how a single CM method can contribute to, and\ninfluence an AHM outcome. The integration of multi-CM methods and various performance\nmonitoring variable (pressure, temperature etc) of the same component or system can be\nmuch more powerful in terms of diagnostics and prognostics.\n7.1 Case Study -1\nPumps are generally used in most of our domestic and industrial applications. In Europe, pumps\nconsume 117 TWH of electricity per annum, while approximately 10% of all electricity used by\nindustry and commerce account for 58MT of CO2 emissions [16]. Every pump manufacturer\nprovides specifications and performance characteristic profiles for their equipment under\nspecified conditions. These profiles demonstrate the inter-relationship between discharge\ncapacities, pump head, power and operating efficiency. The ideal operating point for a pump is\nknown as the \u2018Best Efficiency Point\u2019 (BEP) for that specified condition, and the BEP is normally\nthe target OEE for that pump. This is the point where pump capacity and head pressure combine\nto provide the maximum efficiency of the pump. If the pump operates outside the BEP, not only\nwill its efficiency be compromised, but it will also be subject to increased wear, thus reducing its\noperational life, consequent residual life, WLCC and OEE. It has already been acknowledged\nfrom previous workers that most pumps operate outside their BEP [17]. For example, a recent\nstudy [18] on a 2.2MW centrifugal pump showed that the AET could determine the pumps actual\nBEP, see figure 2. It is interesting to note that for the case study presented (2.2MW pump),\nvibration measurements also showed minimum levels at the best efficiency point, though not as\n- 12 -\nclearly disenable as values associated with AE activity, see figure 2. The significance of this\nadvance in the application of AET to pumps could allow operators to obtain measurable\nindicators, either on-line or off-line, that directly correlate to performance and efficiency, thereby\nallowing for maximisation of pump efficiency and decreasing the WLCC and OEE.\nNDE Bearing vertical\nvibration\nAE at Impeller eye\nposition\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 2250 2500\nFlow rate (m3\/h)\nN\nD\nE\nbe\na\nrin\ng\nv\ne\nrt\nic\na\nlv\nib\nra\ntio\nn\n(m\nm\n\/s\n)\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\nFlow rate (m3\/h)\nA\nE\nin\nr.\nm\n.\ns\n(v)\nBEP\nFigure 2 Identification of a pump BEP with the use of a single CM technology [18]\n7.2 Case Study-2\nThe following is a case study within the power generation industry of an AE condition\nmonitoring programme where the resulting data is used in a CM maintenance programme that\nserves industrial OEE and the environment.

In the power generation industry rubbing is an undesired contact between a rotating part\n(main shaft) and stationary part (seal). It usually occurs as a secondary effect of some machine\nmalfunction such as unbalance, misalignment or thermal expansion. Rubbing in large steam\nturbines is a common occurrence; however, there are occasions when the rubbing becomes severe\nenough for the machine to be removed from service. This has significant consequences on the\nWLCC and OEE factors of the AHM for this machine.\nThe most common method of diagnosing shaft-seal rubbing is vibration monitoring of the\nbearing pedestals using accelerometers and velocity transducers. However, the use of vibration\nmonitoring only confirms that rubbing is taking place and in some instances, the damage suffered\nis significant before a measurable change in vibration level is recorded. The generation of AE\nduring the sliding motion of two mating surfaces is attributed to adhesion, contact and\ndeformation of asperities and the ploughing action of wear particles [18] and it has been shown\nthat the strength and rate of AE activity is dependent on sliding velocity, friction coefficient of\nmating surfaces, contact pressure and the height of surface roughness. For these reasons AET is\nemployed for earlier detection of machine malfunction, such as rubbing. Due to its high\nsensitivity to frictional contact, AET offers an opportunity to detect and locate rotor-stator rubs.\nMore importantly, it allows for the detection of early\/incipient rubbing. During operation\n(3000rpm) of a power generation unit of this case study, measured AE activity showed evidence\nof rubbing, evident by the presences of periodic AE bursts noted in the waveform, see figure 3.\n- 14 -\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\nVo\nlts\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\nVo\nlts\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-5\n0\n5\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\nAE signatures from LP 2 Front\nFigure 3 AE waveforms taken from three bearings of an operational turbine unit [15]\nConsequently the operating conditions of the turbine units were adjusted to reduce the dynamic\nshaft displacement to acceptable operational levels. This was achieved by reducing the system\nvacuum, thereby causing a rise in steam exhaust temperature and thus an increase in clearance\nbetween the seals and the rotor. Acoustic Emission was again measured after this change in\nprocess condition, with the absence of AE levels due to the rubbing. This study verified that a\nsingular AE monitoring technology contributes to improvement in WLCC and OEE.\nThese two case studies exemplify the role that a single CM method can play in decreasing these\nAHM factors, also reducing environmental emissions by maintaining optimum efficiency levels\nof operational asset. The significance of an integrated AHM using multi-CM methods and\n- 15 -\nperformance monitoring tools is obvious. Certification of personnel involved with such\nmeasurements to international standards cannot be over emphasised. Further, numerous examples\nof the application of AET to improving WLCC are publicly available [19] as is the case with\nother CM technologies.\n8. Conclusions\nAsset Health Management (AHM), supported by condition monitoring (CM) and performance\ntesting technologies, together with trending, modelling and diagnostic frameworks, is not only\ncritical to the reliability of high-value machines, but also to a companies the Overall Equipment\nEfficiency (OEE), system safety, profitability and \u2018return on investment\u2019 (ROI). AHM and CM\nare also critical to the global environment and economic sustainable development. Industries that\nmonitor Key Performances Indicators (KPI) to improve OEE and safety as part of an AHM\nprotocol, would benefit from testing personnel who are certified as competent and conforming to\nspecialised ISO qualification standards that share the same objectives as AHM, CM and\nsustainable development. Furthermore, the development of \u2018models\u2019 and integration strategies for\ndetermining Carbon tax burdens imposed by government initiatives is fundamentally dependent\non the integrity and accuracy of the AHM data collected. The BINDT scheme presented in this\npaper shares the same over-riding objectives of safety and OEE as specified for AHM and CM\nprotocols. The certified personnel should apply standards (ISO, EN) that are specific to the\nengineering asset, where best practice demands. The qualification standards however are best\nimplemented by a certification body offering a 3rd party certification programme accredited in\nconformity with an international standard.\n- 16 -\n9.
