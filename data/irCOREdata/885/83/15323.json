Every year, many \nemployees take the decision to migrate. So far the literature has focused on the motivation to \nexpatriate, on the one hand, or Human Resource Management (HRM) for international \nassignments within an organisation, on the other hand. Little regard is paid to the \nopportunities HRM can play in supporting the adjustment of self-initiated expatriates to the \nnew organisation and culture. The paper derives assumptions based on Black et al.\u2019s model of \nadjustment to help self-initiated expatriates to adjust and reach their performance potential \nmore quickly. We argue that organisations should consider whether their current practices \nenhance or hinder the successful employment of self-initiated expatriates. Besides work-\nrelated HRM practices, HRM for self-initiated expatriates should consider expanding support \ninto non-work areas, such as supporting partner relocation or helping to find accommodation.  \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n3 \nSelf-initiated expatriation: Consequences for HRM \nIntroduction \nGlobal migration is an increasing trend demonstrated by the willingness of Europeans to \nmigrate within and beyond the continent for employment (Strack et al., 2007). It is unclear, \nhowever, in how far organisations are prepared for the challenge of managing foreign staff.  \nThe management of talent has been highlighted as the most challenging issue facing \nemployers in Europe going forward to 2015 (Strack et al 2007). Competition for talent is not \njust about competing locally but competing globally, thus raising issues for HR as to who to \nattract and how to retain such talent. Some countries and some organisations take HRM \npractices quite seriously when it comes to competing for talent on the global market. For \nexample, there are international job advertisement sites where organisations can publicise \nthemselves as an employer of choice to candidates \nhttp:\/\/www.addjobs.co.uk\/jobboards\/international\/index.asp). For organisations, it can be \nhighly attractive to have international staff, especially as the competition between companies \ngrows more and more internationally. Especially, in areas of skills shortages, the competition \nfor talent is ever-increasing. Therefore, adopting an internationally focused HR strategy may \nenhance competitive advantage for the company. However, incorporating an international \nfocus to HR practices at many organisations seems to be in its infancy. In order to attract and \nretain international staff and compete on the global talent market, HRM within organisations \nneeds to become more purposeful and proactive. This paper will outline how research in other \nareas of expatriation can inform HRM in organisations and enhance good practice. While \nmost research in the area has been conducted using international assignees, self-initiated \nexpatriation has recently gained more attention (e.g., Jokinen, Brewster & Suutari, 2008). \nHowever, research in this area has considered self-initiated expatriates as a relatively \nhomogenous group. We argue that there are two major differences within the groups of self-\nSelf-initiated expatriation \n4 \ninitiated expatriates to be taken into account: While some expatriates leave their country to \npursue a career in a different country, others leave for personal reasons, such as to follow a \nrelationship or simply for the love of a specific country. The former will go abroad on the \nbasis of a job offer, whereas the latter will not necessarily have a job when they arrive in the \nnew country. In the case of expatriates coming to a new country because he\/she was offered a \njob (we can them here \u201ccareer expatriates\u201d), organisations may be more or less aware of their \nspecific needs for training and development. However, the expatriates arriving for personal \nreasons (called here \u201cprivate expatriates\u201d) and applying while already in the country will be \nconsidered similar to home nationals as their status as an expatriate will be more of a chance \nissue, rather than something the organisation is prepared for. In this theoretical contribution, \nwe concentrate on adjustment and acculturation using the framework of Black, Mendenhall \nand Oddou (1991). Using a differentiation of expatriates based on their motivation to go \nabroad, we will differentiate which HR practices are more or less relevant for which type of \nself-initiated expatriate. This differentiation is very much in line with recent calls for \ndifferentiation in HR practices which acknowledges that HR practices do not affect all \nemployees in the same way (for a recent example see Kinnie, Hutchinson, Purcell, Rayton & \nSwart, 2005). Our aim is to advancing knowledge to inform HR practices by providing a \nresearch agenda and developing propositions. \n \nExpatriation: Some numbers \nResearch into expatriates has mainly focused on employees sent on assignments by their \ncompany (Richardson & Mallon, 2005; Suutari & Brewster, 2000). However, self-initiated \nexpatriation where an individual achieves employment outside their home country is an \nequally important topic. Although absolute numbers for self-initiated expatriation are not \navailable, evidence for the significance of self-initiated expatriation can be found. According \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n5 \nto the Institute for Public Policy Research 5.5 million British citizens live abroad \n(Sriskandarajah & Drew, 2006, see also Guardian weekend from the 27-01-07). The UK \nOffice for National Statistics states that \u201cin 2002, 125,000 people migrated from the UK to \nthe European Union (EU), compared with 89,000 who migrated from the EU to the UK. This \ngives a net outflow of 36,000 to the EU\u201d (Office for National Statistics, 2005), indicating the \nimportance of migration within the EU.  \nIndirect evidence for the prevalence of self-initiated expatriation comes from a study \non international assignments by Riusala and Suutari (2000) who contacted 1,100 expatriates. \nOf the 448 returned questionnaires, 147 (32.8 percent) had to be excluded because they came \nfrom self-initiated expatriates. As far as EU citizens are concerned, the ongoing expansion of \nthe EU has offered its citizens many possibilities: rather than having to focus on their home \nlabour market, Europeans are free to live and work all over Europe (see Article 39 of the \ntreaty establishing the European Community (treaty of Rome), European Union, 1957). With \nthe Schengen-Treaty ratified in 1985, borders, as far as labour mobility is concerned, became \nlargely a thing of the past within the EU (European Union, 2000). This means that migration \nhas become quite easy within the EU and the regulations will enhance migration even further. \n \nSelf-initiated expatriates: Definition and differentiation \nWe define self-initiated expatriates in this paper as employees who decide to migrate to \nanother country for work. For our theoretical analyses, however, we will, focus on self-\ninitiated expatriates who give up their position in their home country prior to migration, rather \nthan those on a career break spent abroad. Self-initiated expatriates initiate their expatriation \nand find a position in another country by themselves.  \nAs mentioned earlier, a large amount of the prior literature on expatriates has focused \non employees undertaking international assignments. These two groups of expatriates can be \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n6 \ncontrasted to each other. Employees on international assignments have a job arranged for \nthem by their company before they leave their home organisation. In contrast to self-initiated \nexpatriates, employees on international assignments usually receive training prior to leaving \nfor assignment. In addition, a typical package for international assignees can include culture \nand language training as well a compensation package that takes into account educational \nbenefits for children, rental supplements etc. (Peterson, Napier & Shim, 1996, \nPricewaterhouseCoopers, 2005). The job of an employee on an international assignment is \nusually restricted in its time perspective, anything from 3 months to 5 years. The time \nperspective for self-initiated expatriate is less clear. Excluding career breaks here, self-\ninitiated expatriates can plan to stay for a period of time or for good but this will usually not \nbe predetermined. See table 1 for an overview of differences between self-initiated expatriates \nand employees on international assignments.  \nTable 1: Overview of differences between self-initiated expatriates and employees on \ninternational assignments \n Self-initiated expatriates International assignees \nInitiation Self Company \nPre departure preparation, training \netc. \nSelf Company \nTime-perspective No limit Limited  \nJob secured prior to expatriation? Yes or No Yes  \nCompensation package No Yes \nSupport in non-work issues No Yes \n \nIn terms of HRM and employee needs, another group from which to differentiate self-\ninitiated expatriates are other organisational newcomers with prior job experience. The reason \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n7 \nfor this is the different levels of knowledge that self-initiated expatriates and organisational \nnewcomers bring to their new workplace. Whereas the organisational culture prevalent at their \nnew workplace in unknown to both self-initiated expatriates and organisational newcomers, \nthe latter are familiar with the country\u2019s culture. Both self-initiated expatriates and \norganisational newcomers will know the characteristics of the job from prior experience and \nwill not know the specific job characteristics of the position they are just starting. The \norganisational newcomer, in contrast to the self-initiated expatriate, may, however, know \nwhat the position comprises of on a country level (e.g., the hours of work), even if the \nspecifics vary between organisations and on different levels of the job. Table 2 provides an \noverview of the differences between initiated expatriates and organisational newcomers.  \nTable 2: Overview of differences between self-initiated expatriates and employees on \norganisational newcomers \n Self-initiated expatriates  Newcomers \nCountry culture Unknown Known  \nOrganisational culture Unknown Unknown \nJob characteristics \n(general) \nKnown Known \nJob characteristics \n(country level) \nUnknown Known \nJob characteristics \n(organisation) \nUnknown Unknown \n \nSelf-initiated expatriates: Motivation to go abroad \nMotivation to go abroad and work can differ considerably. While some expatriates go abroad \nto start a new job and maybe enhance their career, others may have been actively recruited by \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n8 \norganisations that cannot find a specific skill locally. Additionally, others expatriate for \npersonal reasons, including love for a specific country or to pursue a romantic relationship. \nAlthough at first glance, the motivation for expatriation may seem to be less relevant for HR \npractices, we will argue in the following that it is very relevant indeed.  \nExpatriates differ regarding the question whether or not they prepared a job for \nthemselves before going abroad. In terms of HR practices, this differentiation is relevant for \nseveral reasons. For example, expatriates that have applied for a job and move abroad to take \nup that position will probably be more prepared for the job related aspects of their move, \nthough maybe not for the intercultural challenges. On the other hand, expatriates who move to \na certain country because of the country rather than the job may be more prepared for \nintercultural challenges than for the challenges involved in starting a new job abroad. In \naddition to the differences within the group of expatriates, the company involved may have \nmore or less interest in a successful acculturation, depending on whether they particularly \nwanted the expatriate prior to expatriation and, consequently, spend more effort in helping the \nexpatriate to adjust. Expatriates that live in the country before applying for a job, in contrast, \nmay be considered more equally to other (home) applicants. This interest of the organisation \nin the expatriate will differ considerably depending on the local labour market. If the labour \nmarket is characterised by skill shortage, organisations usually have more interest in the \nsuccessful adjustment of the expatriate. We can assume that the source of support may differ \nconsiderably depending on the expatriates situation and the situation of the local labour \nmarket. In the following, we will review prior research on self-initiated expatriates and \ninternational assignees in order to derive propositions for HR practices relating to self-\ninitiated expatriates. We will then differentiate these hypotheses on the basis of our \ndifferentiation of self-initiated expatriates introduced above.  \n \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n9 \nSelf-initiated expatriation and career \nSelf-initiated expatriation can be regarded in the context of modern careers where individuals \nmanage their own careers (e.g., the boundaryless or the Protean career, see Inkson, 2006, or \nthe global boundaryless career, Carr, Inkson & Thorn, 2005). The protean career concept was \nintroduced by Hall (1996) who claimed that careers in the 21st century are \u201c \u2026 driven by the \nperson, not the organization, and [careers] will be reinvented by the person from time to time, \nas the person and the environment change.\u201d (p. 8). This statement is certainly valid for self-\ninitiated expatriates (see also Baruch & Hall, 2004). This is underlined when looking into the \nreasons for migration: According to Carr et al. (2005), there are five main reasons for \nmigration: Economic factors, political factors, cultural factors (such as the choice of a similar \nculture but in a country with greater economic possibilities), family factors (e.g., family \nreunion), and career factors (such as professional development). From interviews among 30 \nBritish expatriate academics, Richardson and McKenna (2002) derived four metaphors for \nreasons for leaving: explorer; refugee; mercenary; and architect. Three of those, namely, the \nexplorer, the mercenary and the architect leave their country in order to gain something in the \nother country (interesting experience, financial rewards or career-building, respectively). \u201cA \nrefugee\u201d is mostly interested in leaving the country he\/she presently works in. Similar to the \nexplorer metaphor, Richardson and Mallon (2005) report those topics in connection to self-\ndirected migration of academics include desire for adventure and new experience. Presuming, \nthese reasons will be similar for other self-initiated expatriates, especially knowledge workers. \nThis is supported by Hall (2005). He analysed migration among high-skilled knowledge \nworkers in general and concludes that besides pay issues, the possibility to \u201cpursue problems \nthat interest them\u201d (p. 948) is most important for high-skilled knowledge workers. \nInternational assignees may volunteer for an assignment abroad but are operating \nwithin the career development opportunities of their company. The responsibility for the \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n10 \nemployee\u2019s career consequently is more in the hands of the company than the individual. Hall \nand Moss (1998) call for a relational approach that companies should take towards their \nemployees\u2019 careers where employers provide opportunities, rather than manage employees\u2019 \ncareers. As Selmer (1999) puts it, the responsibility for career development lies both with the \nindividual and the organization. In the case of self-initiated expatriation, although individual \nexpatriates have taken responsibility for their career to a great extent, the company which \nemploys them still has a duty to contribute to their development. As is obvious from the \nabove cited literature, much research has focused on expatriation as driven by one\u2019s career or \nprofessional interest. However, this definition of self-initiated expatriation only applies to \nself-initiated expatriates that go abroad to take up a job and not for those that expatriate for \npersonal reasons. The latter seems to be an under-researched group in the expatriation \nliterature. \n \nSelf-initiated expatriation and HRM \nWhilst one can argue quite easily for the need of HRM initiatives for self-initiated expatriates \nfrom the perspective of their personal well-being, the question may arise why HRM for self-\ninitiated expatriates is important to organisations, especially if the expatriate was not \u201cinvited\u201d \nto come and join the organisation from abroad but applied while already in the country. One \ncould argue that if an individual decides to expatriate, his or her adjustment and acculturation \nis his or her own responsibility. However, in order to gain advantage from self-initiated \nexpatriates, organisations must try to smooth the transfer from one country to another. As \nAycan (1997) puts it: \u201cOrganizational assistance reduces the time the expatriate has to spend \non these issues and facilitates adjustment to the new work setting\u201d (p. 445). Consequently, \nprofessional HRM policies and practices can assist the expatriate to perform at the expected \nstandard from early on. HRM can become a unique selling point for the individual \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n11 \norganisation in the competition for global talent. An example is developing an employer \nbrand that is communicated internally and externally and, crucially, during the recruitment \nprocess to attract talent (Glen, 2006). \nIn terms of international assignments, HR management can focus on two parts of the \nprocess: support prior to leaving and support on-site (Suutari & Burch, 2001). Mostly, \nresearch has focused on training expatriates in their home country (e.g., Waxin & Panaccio, \n2005). With respect to self-initiated expatriates, the receiving company cannot support \nexpatriates prior to their emigration. That means that HRM in this case has to focus on \nsupporting expatriates in their host country. In other words, the focus of HRM is on the \nadjustment of expatriates after expatriation has commenced.  \nAdjustment to the new culture or acculturation works in four stages (Black, 1988): \nThe \u201choneymoon\u201d stage, a frustration stage, and a stage where some new behaviours have \nbeen adopted. In the fourth stage, adjustment is complete (see also Hofstede, 2001). \nAccording to Hofstede (2001), three different results of acculturation can be differentiated: (a) \nContinue to feel alien and discriminated against, (b) bicultural adaptation, and (c) going \nnative. Only the latter two can be described as successful acculturation. \nBlack and colleagues (e.g., Black, 1988; Black et al., 1991) introduced probably the \nmost elaborate model of adjustment. They differentiate between three types of in-country \nadjustment, namely, (a) work adjustment, (b) adjustment to interaction with host nationals, \nand (c) adjustment to general environment (p. 304). In addition, according to Black (1988), \nadjustment can be subjective or objective. Subjective adjustment describes how comfortable \nexpatriates feel in their new role. Objective adjustment refers to the mastery of role \nrequirements and performance. Combining these two different approaches leads to a three x \ntwo table of adjustment requirements that an expatriate is to achieve (see Table 3). The best \nresult for an expatriate and his\/her employer would, of course, be successful adjustment with \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n12 \nrespect to all facets. Table 3 points out some possible results of expatriates subjective and \nobjective work adjustment, interaction adjustment, and general adjustment, respectively. \nTable 3: Facets of adjustment \n Work adjustment Interaction adjustment General adjustment \nSubjective adjustment Job satisfaction Feeling at ease in \ninteractions \nNot feeling alien \nObjective adjustment Performance  Cooperation with home \nnationals  \nAccommodation, \nsocial life \n \nAs self-initiated expatriates cannot be prepared by their host country\u2019s company prior \nto their expatriation, antecipatory adjustment, as Black et al. (1991) call it, cannot be provided \nby the employer is up to the expatriate him-\/herself. With respect to adjustment in the host-\ncountry, Black et al. (1991) distinguish between individual, job, organisational culture and \nnon-work factors influencing adjustment. Individual adjustment refers to self-efficacy and \nskills (relation, perception). Job antecedents include role clarity, role discretion, role novelty, \nand role conflict. Organisational antecedents comprise organisation culture novelty, social \nsupport, and logistic help. Non-work factors include culture novelty and family-spouse \nadjustment (Black et al., 1991, p. 303). However, as anticipatory adjustment cannot be \nexpected to have taken place, tasks that would otherwise have been dealt with prior to \nexpatriation will be on the agenda after arrival in the host-country. In terms of HRM, the fact \nthat the expatriate will arrive without prior preparation by the company will put more \nemphasis on the selection process and therefore the individual antecedents of adjustment. In \nthe following, we will outline propositions for HR support for successful expatriate \nadjustment. We will concentrate on objective adjustment as this is the type of adjustment that \nHR can probably influence the most and that is also easier to control in terms of successful \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n13 \nadjustment. However, in a later part of this paper, we will outline how HR support can \ninfluence the individual\u2019s effort for subjective adjustment. \n \nSelection \nBlack et al. subsume self-efficacy, relation skills and perception skills under individual \nantecedents of adjustment. In research about international assignments, one factor that often \nemerges as a key factor in the failure of international assignments is the selection on the basis \nof technical rather than intercultural skills (Black and Gregersen, 2007; Harris & Brewster, \n1999). While employees on international assignment can be prepared for their future \nintercultural encounter, this is not possible (at least it is not possible for the organisation) in \nthe case of self-initiated expatriates. In order to be able to \u2018fit in\u2019 and interact successfully \nwith host nationals, it is therefore preferable for self-initiated expatriates to possess good \ncross cultural skills prior to starting their new position, or, as Tharenou (2003) suggests \npossess receptivity to working abroad. Harris, Brewster and Sparrow (2003) concur that \nexpatriates essentially should possess soft skills. This may be quite difficult to assess, \nespecially if the future employer wants to avoid treating the expatriate differently from a \n\u2018home\u2019 applicant. Prior work experience, however, may include working with colleagues \nfrom different countries. Consequently, this type of cooperation can serve as a clue for \ninterpersonal and cross-cultural skills. \nSimilar to success and failure in international assignments (Larson, 2006), another \nfactor that will influence the success of self-initiated expatriates is prior foreign experience. \nThis again is quite easy to assess from a CV, without the need to put the potential expatriate \nthrough additional selection processes beyond those that all applicants have to undergo.  \nTaking into consideration, the motivation to go abroad, we can assume that expatriates \nwho migrated for private reasons may already be familiar with the countries culture as they \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n14 \nare living in the country and have made the choice for a specific country rather than a specific \nposition. Therefore, the question whether or not they possess soft skills will be less relevant. \nHowever, a different issue will be to assess their qualifications. As they want to be in the \ncountry for personal reasons, it is quite possible that they are willing to accept a position that \nhas a low fit with their prior work experience. \nWhereas one may consider selection to relate to the organisations ability to practice \neffective selection strategies for self-imitated expatriates, there is also the issue of how \ncandidates select the organisation. In contrast to an assignment, the self-initiated expatriate \nchooses the organisation he\/she wants to work for. Therefore, HR interventions can play a \nvital role in developing their organisation as an employer of choice Thus, positively engaging \nwith potential candidates is arguably as important as the actual formal selection process. \n \nProposition 1a: With respect to \u201ccareer expatiates\u201d, prior cooperation with \ncolleagues from different countries and prior foreign experience serve as an indicator \nin interpersonal and cross-cultural skills. Self-initiated expatriates who have \ncooperated with colleagues from different countries and\/or have prior foreign \nexperience will more easily adapt to their host countries than others who have not \ncooperated with colleagues from different countries or have prior foreign experience. \nSelf-selection plays a role in the selection process. \nProposition 1b: With respect to \u201cprivate expatriates\u201d, social skills can be taken more \nfor granted but technical skills will need closer examination. \n \nDefinition of position \nBlack et al. (1991) include role clarity, role discretion, role novelty, and role conflict in their \nantecedents of in-country adjustment. For self-initiated \u201ccareer expatriates\u201d one\u2019s first thought \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n15 \nmay be that nothing much changes, for example, an accountancy role or academic position in \nthe UK will have a combination of work activities which are broadly similar in most \ncountries. However, the actual work-load and context may be very varied in different \ncountries. Even if the self-initiated expatriate remains in their prefered field of work, there can \nbe variations in the role requirement which comprise tacit assumptions about cooperation that \nmay be very different in different countries. A \u2018home\u2019 national will most probably be aware \nof this tacit assumptions but a self-initiated expatriate will need more information and support \nin understanding the expectations. However, \u201cprivate expatriates\u201d may need more support in \nadjusting to the work role as their position may differ from their prior work experience. Thus, \nit is even more vital to them with an accurate picture of the organisation\u2019s expectation toward \nthem.  \n \nProposition 2: In addressing job-related antecedents of adjustment, giving a clear \ndefinition of a position will have a positive effect on self-initiated expatriate work \nadjustment. This will be especially true for \u201cprivate expatriates\u201d. \n \nMentoring  \nProbably the most important point to address for the expatriate is cross-cultural awareness. \nResearch into cross-cultural training has shown that such training is generally effective in \nterms of expatriate adjustment (Black & Mendenhall, 1990; Waxin & Panaccio, 2005). \nReferring to Brislin (1979), Waxin and Panaccio (2005) differentiate three methods of cross-\ncultural training, namely, cognitive, affective and behavioural (p. 52). This links in with the \nthree facets of cultural intelligence that Early and Ang (2003) distinguish, that is, the \ncognitive, the motivational and the behavioural facet (p. 67). This differentiation highlights \nthe fact that expatriates need not only to know what is the right behaviour in a different \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n16 \nculture, they also need to be motivated to show that behaviour and, maybe most important of \nall, be able to demonstrate it. Given the clear benefits cross-cultural training can have during \nadjustment (Waxin & Panaccio, 2005), the host country HR can ensure that such training is \nfacilitated.  \nHowever, in order to enhance interaction adjustment while at work, organisations can \nuse other options, such as providing a mentoring system or using co- working systems. These \ntechniques provide direct learning possibilities and opportunities to clarify questions while \nworking on a specific task and will therefore support especially interaction adjustment. We \ncan assume that this is less relevant for \u201cprivate expatriates\u201d. However, though they are \nfamiliar with the culture of their country of choice, they may still need to be advised on \nbusiness practices. We therefore assume that both types of expatriates benefit from mentoring.  \n \nProposition 3: At work support such as mentoring and co-working enhances \ninteraction adjustment for self-initiated expatriates. \n \nNon-work-related aspects HR \nDealing with non-work-related issues is a feature of HRM that is more relevant to expatriate \nHR practices rather than home HR practices. Other non-work-related factors can be derived \nfrom Suutari and Burch (2001): In their study regarding on-site training and support for \ninternational assignees, Suutari and Burch (2001, table 3) derive eleven support practices \nfrom their interviews: arrival and reception; accommodation; shopping\/banks; transportation; \npublic authorities; local laws\/rules; health care system; schools\/day care; free time \npossibilities; partner work arrangements; and family social activities. Shaffer and Harrison \n(1998) examined the effect of work, non-work and family influences on work and non-work \nsatisfaction of expatriates. Partner adjustment and partner satisfaction influenced expatriate \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n17 \nnon-work satisfaction. Also, partner adjustment and living conditions had an impact on \ninteraction and cultural adjustment. Although these results are based on research on \ninternational assignees, it makes obvious the wider HRM needs of expatriates as opposed to \nhome nationals. Shaffer and Harrison (1998) mention four HRM aspects related to partners: \njob search assistance; assistance with obtaining work permits\/ visas; continuing education; \nand allowances for professional seminars and conferences. This research indicates that there is \na clear need for HRM practices to switch focus from the expatriate employee only to \nincluding partner issues (see also recommendations by Richardson & Zikic, 2007). \nComing to a new country often sets challenges in very practical terms. These may \ninclude taxation and custom and excise issues (see Baruch, Steele & Quantrill, 2002, for an \nexample of a company providing support for taxation issues). Finding out about the rules and \nregulations in other countries can take a while and will prevent the expatriates from \nperforming effectively in the first stage of expatriation, if only because he or she will be off \nwork to organise these practicalities. Therefore, support from HR can ease the transition for \nan expatriate. \nIn Baruch\u2019s et al. (2002) study, accommodation was among the four most important \nmotivators for single expatriates for expatriation. Whereas accommodation may not serve as a \nmotivator for all expatriates, finding a place to stay can be quite stressful, especially when the \nexpatriate does not speak the local language or is not familiar with the local rules and \nregulations. Especially, when an expatriate migrates for the job, HR can in this case facilitate \nhelp in finding accommodation and helping with the legal issues involved.  \nAccording to Suutari and Burch (2001), the use of network possibilities, whether \nformal or informal, is advisable for companies, maybe especially during the first stages of \nexpatriation. HR initiatives to develop informal networks or communities may help the \ntransition and give support to better integration and adjustment. However, all these more \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n18 \npractical issues will be less relevant for the \u201cprivate expatriate\u201d. They will have found \naccommodation and arranged the necessary papers before starting a new position. \nPartner\/spouse matters will be, of course, least relevant for those who came to the country to \nlive with a local partner.  \n \nProposition 4: Addressing non-work-related antecedents of adjustment, such as \nintercultural training, family adjustment and practical issues will have a positive \neffect on self-initiated expatriate adjustment. This will not be relevant for \u201cprivate \nexpatriates\u201d.  \n \nObjective and subjective adjustment: HR support and reciprocity \nSo far, we have argued for the influence of HR support on different facets of objective \nadjustment. Subjective adjustment, in contrast, will be more related to the expatriates own \nattitudes and efforts. For successful expatriation this means that both the organisation and \nindividual have to join their efforts. However, organisational and individual efforts are not \nindependent as recent research by De Vos, Dewettinck and Buyen (in press) on career self-\nmanagement and organisational career management and their joint effect on organisational \ncommitment suggests. In terms of employment contract and reciprocity, one can expect that \nthe more an organisation invests into an expatriate\u2019s adjustment, the more he\/she will engage \nin adjustment effort as well. If, however, the expatriate does not perceive support in \nadjustment efforts, he\/she may feel that it is not worth putting effort into adjustment \nhim\/herself and, consequently, will rather tend to look for a position in a different \norganisation or even a different country.  \n \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n19 \nProposition 5: HR support for adjustment is positively related to self-initiated \nexpatriate\u2019s own effort with respect to adjustment. HR support and individual efforts \ntogether lead to successful overall adjustment. \n \nDiscussion, limitations, future research, and conclusion \nFrom the lack of literature in this area, we may conclude that few companies actively and \nsystematically engage in expatriate HRM when dealing with self-initiated expatriates. Using \nBaruch and Altman\u2019s (2002) taxonomy of corporative expatriation and repatriation practices, \none may assume that with respect to HRM for self-initiated expatriates most companies fall \nunder the category of expedient organisations: their approach to HRM of self-initiated \nexpatriates will be ad-hoc and pragmatic rather than following an embedded HRM policy. To \nput it again in Baruch and Altman\u2019s (2002) words: they are merely managing chaos (p. 252).  \nTaking into account different aspects of adjustment, we derived a set of propositions \nfor successful self-initiated expatriate adjustment. Our theoretical review took Black et al.\u2019s \n(1991) model as a starting point to derive assumptions on which factors can help self-initiated \nexpatriates to adjust better to their work, interaction and environment. Figure 1 provides a \nsummary of our propositions regarding how different HR practices influence different types \nof adjustment. We argue that for the different types of adjustment, different HR practices are \nmore relevant. We initially focused on objective adjustment as subjective adjustment is \ndifficult to evaluate for HR, on the one hand, and difficult to influence, on the other hand. \nHowever, joint efforts for adjustment are necessary to achieve successful adjustment. On the \nbasis of reciprocity, we expect that HR support stimulates the self-initiated expatriate\u2019s own \neffort for adjustment, ultimately leading to successful adjustment.  \nEngaging in HRM can positively affect organisations in several domains. First, a good \nrecruitment strategy can give them a strategic advantage over other companies in that they \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n20 \nwill be able to attract good candidates, thus, combating the growing challenge of managing \ntalent. Second, training and mentoring as well as support in non-work issues will render \norganisations\u2019 international staff effective in a shorter period of time than when these issues \nare not taken into account. Taking into account the different motives for employees to \nexpatriate, can help to chose HR practices that are relevant for the adjustment of the \nindividual. In the context of international assignments, Dickmann, Doherty, Mills and \nBrewster (2008) recently found a marked difference between the reasons expatriates give for \naccepting an assignment and the reasons that organisations believe are relevant in this context. \nThis highlights that an analysis of the needs of the individual expatriate, taking into account \nhis\/her individual background can help to chose the right HR practice to ensure successful \nadjustment and retention. Offering different types of support to choose from is one way \nforward that organisations should consider. Given that line managers are more on more on the \nfore-front of HR (Perry & Kulik, 2008) and that they are considered vital for the success of \nHR policies (Purcell & Hutchinson, 2007), the possibilities for support should be pointed out \nto the relevant line manager who can then pick and choose together with the expatriate and \nfind the most appropriate support. \nOur analysis of HRM for self-initiated expatriates is entirely theoretical. We did not \nconduct a study into the actual international HR practices in organisations. These may be \nquite different between organisations and between countries. Indeed the debate regarding HR \npractices and academic theory are duly noted as a raft of scholars acknowledge that academic \ntheory and actual evidence based practice of HR activities vary greatly (Cascio, 2007; Guest, \n2007; Latham, 2007; Lawler, 2007; Rynes, 2007; Giluk & Brown, 2007; Rousseau, 2007; \nSaari, 2007). While we were aiming at general propositions for HRM for self-initiated \nexpatriates, an analysis of the actual practices would provide us with knowledge about the \npossible gaps to be filled by organisations\u2019 HR practices. Similar to Tung\u2019s (1987) \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n21 \ncomparison of the management of international assignments in different countries, future \nresearch could focus on the differences between organisations in different countries and how \nthey approach the management of expatriates. Especially combining this analysis with \nrecruitment and retention numbers would further our insight into the HRM of self-initiated \nexpatriates.  \nOur theoretical analysis focused on self-initiated expatriates. While our propositions \nmaybe generalisable as far as larger companies are concerned, many self-initiated expatriates \nwill work in small or medium size companies that may not even have an HR department. \nHowever, some of our propositions can be emulated by expatriate networks that may be \nutilised by employer organisations in order to maximise expatriates\u2019 well-being and \nperformance even in very small enterprises. Increasing globalisation places emphasis on \nemployers to utilise HR interventions to enhance their selection of candidates and increase \ntheir competitive advantage over other organisations in the growing competition for global \ntalent. So, while in some countries skill shortage already forces companies to engage \npositively with expatriates and even actively recruit abroad, we argue that the HR practices \noutlined here will be beneficial for all companies that employ expatriates. \nAlthough we have differentiated between two types of self-initiated expatriates, many \nmore types exist. For example, we have not taken into account entrepreneurs who go abroad \nto start a new business, either in their current business area or a totally new type of business. \nEntrepreneurs are, of course, not members of organisations and thus cannot be reached by HR \npractices. Nevertheless, support can be given on a country level, for example, as far as legal \nissues, language or cultural differences are concerned. This would support these expatriates\u2019 \nchances of successful integration. \n \nReferences \nSelf-initiated expatriation \n22 \nAycan, Z. (1997).
