P. Abel, A. K. Mohapatra, M. G. Bason, J. D. Pritchard, K. J. Weatherill, U. Raitzsch and C. S. Adams \u2020\nDepartment of Physics, Durham University, Rochester Building, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, UK\n(Dated: January 2009)\nWe demonstrate laser frequency stabilization to excited state transitions using cascade electromag-\nnetically induced transparency. Using a room temperature Rb vapor cell as a reference, we stabilize\na first diode laser to the D2 transition and a second laser to a transition from the intermediate\n5P3\/2 state to a highly excited state with principal quantum number n = 19 \u2212 70. A combined\nlaser linewidth of 280 \u00b1 50 kHz over a 100 \u00b5s time period is achieved. This method may be applied\ngenerally to any cascade system and allows laser stabilization to an atomic reference in the absence\nof a direct absorption signal.\nMany experiments require a stable frequency in\nthe optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum1.\nTypically, an optical frequency reference is estab-\nlished by locking a laser to an optical transition\nfrom an atomic ground state. Many techniques\nexist for locking to an atomic reference, including\ndichroic atomic vapour laser locking (DAVLL)2,3,4, com-\nbined saturated absorption and DAVLL5,6,7, polariza-\ntion spectroscopy8, Sagnac interferometry9,10, frequency\nmodulation (FM) spectroscopy11 and modulation trans-\nfer spectroscopy12,13,14. Recently, electromagnetically in-\nduced transparency (EIT)15,16 has been used as a disper-\nsive reference to lock the relative frequency of two lasers\nto an atomic ground-state hyperfine splitting17. Also\nDoppler-free two-color spectroscopy has been used to lock\nto excited-excited state transitions where the lower state\nis populated18. A limitation of these schemes is that one\nis restricted to wavelengths corresponding to transitions\nwith a significant population in the lower state or with\nsufficiently large Einstein A-coefficient to produce an ab-\nsorption signal. Where this is not the case the alternative\nis to use a frequency comb or a reference cavity stabilized\nto a ground state transition19. However, these methods\nare limited by the stability of the cavity, which is influ-\nenced by environmental factors such as temperature and\npressure.\nIn this letter, we demonstrate a technique which en-\nables laser stabilization to excited state transitions based\non atomic coherences. In contrast to previous laser stabi-\nlization schemes, which rely on having a significant popu-\nlation in the lower state our technique allows laser stabi-\nlization to excited-excited state transitions with no pop-\nulation in either state. Also, our scheme uses a probe\nlaser to stabilize a second laser at a completely different\nwavelength, as shown in Fig 1 (a). The technique uses\nEIT to transfer information about a weak excited-excited\nstate transition to a strong probe transition. This allows\nlaser stabilization to transitions with small A-coefficients\n(of order 100 Hz) such as transitions to Rydberg states.\n\u2020email: c.s.adams@durham.ac.uk\nIn addition, as the technique is based on an atomic coher-\nence one can obtain resonance widths which are smaller\nthan the natural broadening of the lower state. In princi-\nple, the technique is applicable to any excited state tran-\nsition allowing a large number of additional potential op-\ntical frequency references.\nThe specific case we consider is based on cascade\nRydberg20 EIT in a Rubidium vapour cell21,22 at room\ntemperature. This application is particularly useful for\nexperiments involving highly excited Rydberg states23,24.\nWe present details of our experimental setup and give ex-\namples of locking signals produced at various laser powers\nand for various Rydberg states. The stability of the lock\nis demonstrated by results from an experiment on EIT\nof cold Rydberg ensembles23.\nIn order to produce an error signal we use frequency\nmodulation spectroscopy25. The probe beam is modu-\nlated to give sidebands above and below the EIT reso-\nnance. These sidebands then beat with the probe beam\nto produce a detector signal at the modulation frequency.\nFIG. 1: (a) Energy level diagram of a two photon transition\nto a highly excited state in a typical alkali atom system. By\nprobing the strong ground state transition the excited state\ntransition is detected using EIT. (b) A typical EIT spectrum\nas the coupling laser is scanned across resonance. An EIT\nresonance is oberved at both the carrier and sideband fre-\nquencies, \u03c90 \u00b1 (\u03bbp\/\u03bbc)\u03c9m.\n2FIG. 2: Schematic experimental setup for EIT laser stabiliza-\ntion. The coupling and probe laser are counter propagated\nthrough a magnetically shielded Rb vapour cell. The probe\nbeam is modulated using an EOM and detected using a fast\nphotodetector. This signal is mixed with the oscillator to\nproduce an error signal that is fed back to the coupling laser.\nUsing a phase sensitive detection scheme dispersion and\nabsorption components can be recovered to form an er-\nror signal. The signal detected is at the modulation fre-\nquency, so the bandwidth of the feedback is not limited\nby the resonance width26. With the probe beam locked\nand the coupling beam scanning through resonance an\nEIT feature is observed on the transmission of the probe\nat both the carrier and sideband frequencies as shown in\nFig. 1 (b) . Note that due to the Doppler mismatch be-\ntween the probe and coupling beams, the frequency offset\nof the sidebands is scaled by a factor of \u03bbp\/\u03bbc.\nIn our experiment, the cascade system consists of a\nweak probe beam resonant with the 87Rb 5s2S1\/2 (F=2)\n\u2192 5p2P3\/2 (F\n\u2032) transition followed by an intense cou-\npling beam resonant with the 5p2P3\/2 (F\n\u2032) \u2192 nd2D or\n5p2P3\/2 (F\n\u2032)\u2192 ns2S transitions. The experimental setup\nis shown in Fig. 2. A 780 nm probe beam and 479-486 nm\ncoupling beam are counter propagated through a mag-\nnetically shielded Rubidium vapour cell at room tem-\nperature. Both beams initially have a radius of approxi-\nmately 1 mm and are focused through the cell using a pair\nof lenses. The beams are focused in order to increase the\ncoupling beam intensity, this allows EIT to be observed\nfor transitions with small Einstein A-coefficients, such as\ntransitions to Rydberg states. The coupling light is gen-\nerated by a commercial high power frequency doubled\nlaser (Toptica, TA-SHG). The probe light is provided by\na commercial extended cavity diode laser (ECDL, Top-\ntica DL-PRO ) which is frequency stabilized to the 87Rb\n5s2S1\/2 (F=2) \u2192 5p\n2P3\/2 (F\n\u2032 = 3) resonance using FM\ntransfer spectroscopy14. The probe beam is frequency\nmodulated using an electro-optic modulator (EOM) at\nFIG. 3: Locking signal at varying coupling beam powers. The\nprobe beam was fixed at a power of 4 \u00b5W and was locked\nto the 87Rb 5s2S1\/2 (F=2) \u2192 5p\n2P3\/2 (F\n\u2032 = 3) transition\nand modulated at 10 MHz using an electro-optic modulator\n(EOM). The coupling beam is tuned to the (a) 26D and (b)\n70S Rydberg state and scanned through resonance.\n\u03c9m\/2pi = 10 MHz. The EOM is driven by an amplified\n(Mini-Circuits ZHL-3A) sinusoidal signal from an oscil-\nlator. Following the vapour cell the probe beam is in-\ncident on a fast photodiode (Hamamatsu APD C5460\n10 MHz). The photodiode signal is frequency mixed\n(Mini-Circuits ZAD-6+) with the oscillator after pass-\ning through a phase shifter. The error signal is fed back\nto both the laser current and the external cavity piezo\n(using a Toptica FALC module with a 1 MHz cut-off fil-\nter).\nExamples of the resulting error signals while scanning\nthe coupling laser are shown in Fig. 3. The laser system\nhas been locked to Rydberg states between 19 and 57D\nand error signals observed up to 70S. For Rydberg states\nwith intermediate values of the principal quantum num-\nber, e.g. n = 26 in Fig. 3 (a), an error signal with good\nsignal to noise is obtained with coupling laser powers\nof under 1 mW. For higher Rydberg states and transi-\ntions with smaller dipole matrix elements (the Einstein\nA-coefficient for the 5p-ns transitions is an order of mag-\nnitude less than 5p-nd) significantly higher powers are\nrequired, see Fig. 3 (b).\nAlthough a direct beat measurement of the coupling\nlaser was not feasible we use two approximate methods\nto evaluate the performance of the lock. Firstly we esti-\nmate a lower limit on the linewidth of the coupling laser\nsystem by measuring the rms noise of the error signal. As\nthe amplitude of the error signal depends on the coupling\nlaser power we can increase the gradient of the error sig-\nnal without increasing the amplitude noise due to probe\nlaser intensity fluctuations or electronic noise. This al-\nlows us to distinguish between frequency noise and am-\n3FIG. 4: Transmission of a 200 nW probe beam (red) as a\nfunction of probe beam detuning for the 5S1\/2 \u21925P3\/2 \u219226D\ntransition. The probe laser is scanned over 20 MHz in 0.32\nms. The coupling beam power is 84 mW. The black line\nis the theoretical line of best fit from the model detailed in\nreference23 giving a combined laser linewidth of 280 \u00b1 50 kHz.\nplitude noise and consequently we can determine what is\nlimiting the stability of the lock. The rms noise of the\nlocking signal (averaged over a period of 1 minute) when\nthe laser is locked was measured and divided by the gra-\ndient of the unlocked signal to give a linewidth estimate\nfor the 26D Rydberg state error signals. With a coupling\npower of 0.5 mW the gradient of the locking signal was\n20 mV\/MHz giving a linewidth of 200 kHz. A coupling\npower of 1.0 mW gave a gradient of 70 mV\/MHz and a\nlinewidth of 50 kHz. Finally, a power of 2.4 mW gave a\ngradient of 110 mV\/MHz and a linewidth of 35 kHz, illus-\ntrating that for these parameters the linewidth is primar-\nily limited by the gradient of the error signal and hence\nthe coupling laser power used in the locking scheme.\nSecondly, we obtain an estimate of the combined\nlinewidth of the probe and coupling laser by perform-\ning a two photon Rydberg excitation measurement on a\ncold Rydberg atom ensemble23. The probe and pump\nbeam were counterpropagated through a cloud of laser\ncooled Rb atoms. The probe beam is scanned through\nthe 85Rb D2 F = 3\u2192 F\n\u2032 = 4 transition using an acousto-\noptic modulator (AOM) in a time of 0.32 ms to produce\nthe EIT spectra in Fig. 4. The theoretical model used to\nfit the data indicates a combined relative laser linewidth\nof 280 \u00b1 50 kHz. The transit time broadening gives a\ncontribution of less than 40 kHz.\nAlthough the spectroscopy experiment gives a practi-\ncal indication of the performance of the stabilized laser\nit underestimates the longer term linewidth as the mea-\nsurement was performed over a short time scale of less\nthan 100 \u00b5s. The linewidth of the probe laser was evalu-\nated as the stability of the coupling laser is dependent on\nthe stability of probe. To give an indication of the longer\nterm linewidth we performed a beat measurement be-\ntween the probe laser and two other 780 nm lasers which\nwere locked using an equivalent method. By averaging\nover different numbers of measurements the linewidth\nwas determined over time scales between 3.5 seconds and\n170 seconds. The linewidth of the probe laser was found\nto vary between approximately 200 and 350 kHz which\nis consistent with the cold atom spectroscopy measure-\nment.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated a laser frequency\nstabilization to excited state transitions using cascade\nEIT. Our case of Rydberg excitation displays the power\nof the method as the Einstein-A coefficients to Rydberg\nstates are many orders of magnitude smaller than those\nof the Rb D lines. We expect this approach can be ap-\nplied to many different excitation schemes in atomic and\nmolecular physics experiments.\nAfter submission we became aware of a more\nrecent preprint on two-color modulation transfer\nspectroscopy27, which demonstrated signals associated\nwith excited to excited transitions based on both absorp-\ntion (similar to Ref. 19) and frequency modulation (as\nin our work).\nWe are grateful to I.
