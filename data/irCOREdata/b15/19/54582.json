In such en-\nvironments, the newly hatched larvae are exposed to\nmicroorganisms, both immediately and as decomposition\nprogresses. Such insects are under strong selective pressure\nto resist infection and maintain an effective immune\nresponse.\nIn addition to internal immune resources such as\ncoagulation, phagocytosis, encapsulation and nodule for-\nmation (Sadd & Siva-Jothy, 2006), some insects are equipped\nwith external antimicrobial defences. An example is pro-\nvided by Hoback et al. (2004), who showed oral secretions\nfrom several Nicrophorus beetle species and anal se-\ncretions from one species of Silphinae were active against\nVibrio fischerii bacteria. Early twentieth century studies\n*Author for correspondence\nFax: +44 (0) 114 2254449\nE-mail: K.Barnes@shu.ac.uk\nyCurrent address: Department of Biosciences, Sheffield\nHallam University, City Campus, Sheffield, S1 1WB, UK\nBulletin of Entomological Research, Page 1 of 6 doi:10.1017\/S000748530999071X\n\u0001 Cambridge University Press 2010\ndemonstrated antibacterial activity in external excretions\/\nsecretions (ES) from diptera such as Lucilia sericata (Meigen),\nCalliphora species and Phormia terraenovae (Robineau-\nDesvoidy) (Simmons, 1935; Gwatkin & Fallis, 1938; Pavillard\n& Wright, 1957), species which are carrion feeders. Recent\nwork has extended this knowledge in the context of\nL. sericata and shown that ES from sterile larvae is\nantibacterial against organisms such as MRSA (Thomas\net al., 1999; Bexfield et al., 2004; Kerridge et al., 2005;\nHuberman et al., 2007a). The antimicrobial activity has been\nidentified from two fractions of the ES, one between 0.5 and\n10KDa and a second at less than 500Da. The antimicrobial\nconstituent from the latter fraction has been patented under\nthe name \u2018Seraticin1\u2019 (Bexfield et al., 2008).\nThe success of this recent work signals the need to review\nthe antimicrobial capabilities of other insects inhabiting\ncarrion and detritus in order to determine their potential for\ncontrolling a wider range of microorganisms. The present\nstudy investigated the antibacterial activities of un-induced\nES from larvae of a comparable initial coloniser, Calliphora\nvicina (Robineau-Desvoidy) and two beetle species model-\nling colonisers of later stages of decomposition, Dermestes\nmaculatus (DeGeer) and Tenebrio molitor (Linnaeus). The\nantibacterial activities of their un-induced ES are compared\nto that of ES from L. sericata larvae.\nMaterials and methods\nBacterial viable counts were used to assess the antibac-\nterial potency of ES from each of the four larval species\nagainst five bacterial reference species: Staphylococcus aureus\n(ATCC 25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas\naeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 43071) and\nBacillus cereus (NCIMB 3329). On at least two separate\noccasions, each experiment was replicated three times.\nMarker insect species\nLucilia sericata, a member of the Calliphoridae, was used\nas the marker species as it has been studied intensively\nfor decades as a result of its use in maggot debridement\ntherapy (Simmons, 1935; Thomas et al., 1999; Mumcuoglu\net al., 2001; Lerch et al., 2003; Bexfield et al., 2004, 2008;\nKerridge et al., 2005; Reinecke et al., 2005; Daeschlein et al.,\n2007; Huberman et al., 2007b; Jaklic et al., 2008; van der\nPlas et al., 2008). Calliphora vicina, also an initial coloniser,\nwas used as a comparison to L. sericata since less is\nknown about this species\u2019 antimicrobial excretion\/secretion\n(Gwatkin & Fallis, 1938). Dermestes maculatus colonises\na corpse during the decay stages of decomposition\n(Kulshrestha & Satpathy, 2001; Oliva, 2001; Grassberger &\nFrank, 2004), and Tenebrionidae, such as T. molitor, have\nbeen associated with a corpse during the dry stages of decay\n(Me\u00b4gnin, 1894; Arnaldos et al., 2005; Gennard, 2007).\nLarval ES preparation\nColonies of the Calliphoridae and T. molitor were\nmaintained under a lighting regime of 16:8 h (L :D), whilst\ncultures of D. maculatus were maintained in complete\ndarkness. Lucilia sericata and C. vicina larvae were reared\non a diet of ad libitum porcine liver and D. maculatus and\nT. molitor on dried porcine cubes supplemented with\nworking dog biscuits. All colonies were maintained at a\ntemperature of 25\u0001C+3\u0001C.\nThe excretion\/secretion (ES) was collected from each\nspecies by adding a standardised amount of sterile, de-\nionised water to a sample of larvae which were weighed and\nthe numbers adjusted to give a fixed ratio of maggots to\nwater (1 gmlx1). (Blowfly larvae were collected whilst in the\nthird instar and beetle larvae from actively feeding stages\nwith a standard length of 12+1mm for D. maculatus and\n26+2mm for T. molitor). Larvae were incubated at 30\u0001C for\n60min (a method adapted from Bexfield et al., 2004), after\nwhich ES was collected and micro-centrifuged at 7826rg for\nfive minutes and filtered (0.20 mm) to remove large particles\nand bacteria. The ES from each insect species was then\nstored frozen at x20\u0001C until required.\nRepresentative bacterial species\nThe bacterial species were chosen on the basis that they\nwere representative of the changing micro-organism popu-\nlations on a body during decomposition. There has been\nvery limited research on the succession of microbial species\non a corpse during decomposition, and information about\nspecies, location and growth requirements on live bodies\nand habitats were the criteria used to determine which\nbacteria were to be chosen: Staphylococci as common skin\nbacteria; E. coli and P. mirabilis from the gut; and B. cereus,\nP. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa associated with the environ-\nment, being present in soil and decomposing materials.\nPreparation of bacteria\nOne colony was removed from a stock plate of nutrient\nagar (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) and\nwas inoculated into 20ml sterile tryptone soya broth (TSB)\n(Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England). The broth\nwas incubated at 37\u0001C with shaking for 17 h. A sample of\n0.1ml of the overnight bacterial culture was transferred to\n10ml TSB broth and incubated at 37\u0001C with shaking until\nthe optical density reading at 600 nm was in the range of\n0.24\u20130.25.\nConfirmation of antibacterial activity in ES from the\nmarker species, Lucilia sericata\nThe antibacterial activity of L. sericata ES was quantified\nusing liquid culture assays employing 10% TSB and dH2O or\nES to confirm its antibacterial activity before being used as\nthe marker species in the experiments reported in this paper.\nResults demonstrated that L. sericata ES had a significant\ninhibitory action and that there was > 99% less bacterial\ngrowth in ES than controls throughout a 24-h period (data\nnot shown).\nSample preparation\nTo investigate the antibacterial activity of ES from\nC. vicina, D. maculatus and T. molitor against the known\nactivity of L. sericata, defrosted insect excretion\/secretion\n(ES) from each species was separated into 4ml aliquots.\nThe purpose of this study was to model the antibacterial\nactivity of ES in the insects\u2019 natural environment. Therefore,\nadditional media was not employed in this assay, particu-\nlarly as its effect on antibacterial activity of ES was not\n2 K.M. Barnes, D.E. Gennard and R.A. Dixon\nknown. In order to demonstrate the pattern of normal\nbacterial growth, 4ml aliquots of TSB\/dH2O were utilised as\ncontrols to replace the ES. Twenty ml of bacteria in TSB was\nadded to all aliquots and the universals incubated at 37\u0001C,\nwith aeration, for a 24-h period.\nEffectiveness of bacterial control\nViable counts were prepared on nutrient agar at zero,\nfour, eight and 24h after inoculation for each of the four\ninsect species and the controls. The agar plates were\nincubated at 37\u0001C for 20\u201324 h and viable counts (CFU mlx1)\nwere used to provide a quantitative determination of\nbacterial growth.\nConfirmation of absence of contamination\nTo confirm the sterility of samples of ES prior to bacterial\ninoculation, a loop (10 ml) of ES from each insect, TSB, and\nsterile dH2O were spread separately onto nutrient agar and\nincubated at 37\u0001C for 24 h. This procedure was repeated at\nfour, eight and 24h to ensure the media used to prepare\ndilutions for viable counts was contamination-free.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version\n14.0) on log10 transformed mean count data sets to compare\nbacterial growth in ES from the three insect species in\nrelation to growth in ES from L. sericata. The Bonferroni test\nwas used as a post hoc test on those significantly different\ndata sets confirmed by ANOVA. The results are presented as\nthe mean bacterial count over a 24-h period.\nThe pH of insect ES\nThe pH of each aliquot of ES was recorded prior to each\nexperiment in order to observe possible effects on anti-\nbacterial activity. No attempt was made to alter the pH of the\nES as the intention was to observe its antibacterial activity in\nits natural state.\nResults\nA repeated measures ANOVA indicated that there was\na significant difference between the mean bacterial counts\nin ES from each insect species (F3,27 = 5.43, P= 0.005).\nA Bonferroni post hoc test revealed no significant difference\nbetween the antibacterial effectiveness of ES from L. sericata\nand C. vicina against the five bacterial species (P= 1.00). Nor\nwas any significant difference noted between the antibacter-\nial activity of L. sericata and T. molitor (P= 0.128). However,\nL. sericata was significantly more effective at inhibiting the\ngrowth of the five bacterial species than D. maculatus\n(P= 0.006).\nStaphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923)\nAll insect species allowed some growth of S. aureus\n(fig. 1). Of the species compared, L. sericata was shown to be\nthe most effective source of antibacterial ES for controlling\nS. aureus.\nEscherichia coli (ATCC 25922)\nBoth Calliphorids exhibited good bactericidal activity\nagainst E. coli. Lucilia sericata and C. vicina ES inhibited E. coli\ngrowth over the 24-h period (fig. 2), reducing the mean\nbacterial count by 84% and 63%, respectively. Over the first\nfour hours, C. vicina ES reduced the initial count of E. coli by\n55%; over an 8-h period, the bacterial count was 91% less\nthan the original inoculum. In contrast, bacteria treated with\nES from T. molitor and D. maculatus showed exponential\ngrowth so that over eight hours there was a 102 increase\nin bacterial population, indicating that they were not an\neffective means of control of this species.\nBacillus cereus (NCIMB 3329)\nThere was also a significant difference in the antibacterial\neffectiveness of the four insects\u2019 ES in controlling bacterial\ngrowth over a 24-h period. In the first four hours, both\nL. sericata and C. vicina ES (fig. 3) demonstrated a 100%\nbacterial count reduction of B. cereus. They were, therefore,\n1010\n109\n108\n107\n106\n105\n104\nBa\nct\ner\nia\nl c\nou\nnt\n (lo\ng C\nFU\n\/m\nl)\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\nTime Elapsed (hours)\nFig. 1.

Over the\nfirst four hours, C. vicina ES was the more effective and\nreduced the mean bacterial count by 85%, whilst L. sericata\nES only reduced it by 58%. However, over 24 h, L. sericata ES\nmaintained its bacteriostatic activity (55% mean bacterial\ncount reduction), whereas C. vicina ES allowed re-growth to\noccur in the period between eight and 24 h. In contrast, ES\nfrom both D. maculatus and T. molitor were an ineffective\nmeans of controlling P. aeruginosa since both allowed growth\nthroughout the 24-h period.\nProteus mirabilis (ATCC 43071)\nInterestingly, beetle ES was much more effective against\nP. mirabilis, whilst blowfly ES had no effect (fig. 5). By the\nend of a four-hour period, there was a 60% mean bacterial\ncount reduction in D. maculatus ES and a 66% mean bacterial\ncount reduction in T. molitor ES although, after this point,\nD. maculatus ES allowed bacterial re-growth. Tenebrio molitor\nES continued to inhibit the growth of P. mirabilis for a further\nfour hours (77% mean bacterial count reduction). Therefore,\nT. molitor ES was more efficient at inhibiting the growth of\nP. mirabilis than ES from L. sericata, C. vicina or D. maculatus.\nThe effect of pH on antibacterial activity of ES\nThe pH of ES from each insect had different ranges:\nL. sericata (8.67\u20138.82); C. vicina (8.53\u20138.68); D. maculatus\n(6.00\u20136.14); and T. molitor (5.14\u20135.28). However, a two-tailed\nPearson\u2019s test demonstrated that there was no significant\nlinear correlation between the pH of insect ES and its\nantibacterial potency against the five bacterial species tested.\nThis was true for L. sericata ES (r =x0.09, n= 10, P= 0.815),\nC. vicina ES (r = 0.07, n= 10, P= 0.859), D. maculatus ES\n(r = 0.109, n= 10, P= 0.776) and T. molitor ES (r =x0.448,\nn= 10, P= 0.194). Therefore, pH did not influence antibacter-\nial activity of ES from these species.\nDiscussion\nAll four insect species demonstrated differences in their\npotency against each of the five species of bacteria. However,\nviable counts showed that, at the concentration tested, ES\nfrom all species was capable of reducing bacterial numbers\nfor at least part of a 24-h period (figs 1\u20135); no lag phase was\nobserved during this period.\nThe viable count results for L. sericata ES confirm those\nreported by Bexfield et al. (2008), who showed a 97.4%\ndecrease in E. coli populations over a six-hour period.\nIn contrast, research by Jaklic et al. (2008) established a\nprolonged lag phase of 5\u20136 h for E. coli, after which ex-\nponential growth occurred. He demonstrated this same lag\n109\n108\n107\n106\n105\n103\n104\nBa\nct\ner\nia\nl C\nou\nnt\n (lo\ng C\nFU\n\/m\nl)\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24\nTime Elapsed (hours)\nFig. 3.

Barnes, D.E. Gennard and R.A. Dixon\nphase for P. aeruginosa, which is also in contrast to the results\nreported here.\nHowever, an equivalent level of antibacterial potency\nagainst S. aureus reported by both Bexfield et al. (2008) and\nJaklic et al. (2008) was not demonstrated in this study.\nBexfield et al. (2008) showed that, after a six-hour period,\nL. sericata ES was able to reduce the population of S. aureus\n(106) by 91.5%, and Jaklic et al. (2008) demonstrated a 100%\nreduction of S. aureus after eight hours. These differences\nmay be due to variation in concentration of ES, the types of\nmedia used for the liquid culture assay or the duration of the\nexperimental period between these three studies.\nPrevious researchers have suggested that the pH of insect\nES influenced its antibacterial activity (Gwatkin & Fallis,\n1938; Thomas et al., 1999; Bexfield et al., 2004). Therefore, the\norigin of the antibacterial activity demonstrated in the insect\nES was explored by investigating the pH ranges of ES from\neach insect species. Typically, the ES from L. sericata and\nC. vicina was alkaline (pH8\u20139) compared to the ES from\nD. maculatus and T. molitor, which was found to be acidic\n(pH5\u20136). However, there was no significant correlation\nbetween the pH of insect ES and bacterial growth, indicating\npH had no effect on antibacterial potency. These results\nsupport work conducted by Bexfield et al. (2004), who\nshowed that antibacterial activity in L. sericata ES was not\ndependant on the alkaline condition, by changing the pH\nof L. sericata ES and demonstrating the same antibacterial\nactivity existed in aliquots that were altered to pH6 and 7 as\nwas in native ES (pH8\u20139). Therefore, it appears that the\neffectiveness of insect ES relates to agents other than pH.\nThe fact that larval ES did not always maintain an\nantibacterial effect over the 24-h experimental period does\nnot minimise its potential as an antibacterial agent. Data\nfrom several experiments demonstrated that larval ES is\nproduced continuously (unpublished data); therefore, even\nshort-lived antibacterial activity would still be an effective\ndefence against microbes on a corpse.\nThe difference in antibacterial potency and spectrum\nbetween the blowflies and the beetles is not altogether sur-\nprising and may be explained ecologically by the fact that\nblowflies tend to frequent habitats with potentially more\ndiverse species of bacteria present. As the initial colonisers of\na corpse, blowflies encounter bacteria originating from the\nhuman body. As a corpse decomposes, production of waste\ngases extends the body until, eventually, the skin is broken,\nallowing the gut bacteria (and gases) to escape. It is assumed\nthat most obligate anaerobes will die off at this stage; but\nfacultative anaerobes, such as Proteus and E. coli, will survive\nand be in direct competition with the insects now feeding on\nthe corpse.\nBeetle larvae are generally present on a corpse in the later\nstages of decomposition (advanced and post decay), when\nmuch of the soft tissue has been removed. It is assumed that\nmost human-derived bacteria have been reduced in number\nby earlier insect colonisers and that bacteria from the en-\nvironment probably dominate. Bacterial species, such as\nP. mirabilis, against which the beetle but not blowfly larvae\nES in this study were active, may potentially be present at\nthe time of coleopteran colonisation.\nThe blowflies, L. sericata and C. vicina, produced\nexcretion\/secretion (ES), which was active against both the\nGram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested in this\nstudy. This secretion\/excretion had a broader spectrum and\na more potent antibacterial activity than the ES of either of\nthe beetles, D. maculatus and T. molitor. The blowflies\nwere able to inhibit or reduce growth of four out of the\nfive bacterial species used, whereas the beetles were only\neffective against one, P. mirabilis. These results indicate the\npotential of using ES from carrion-feeding coleoptera as\nantibacterial agents, as well as those of Calliphoridae, and\nthat the poorer antibacterial capacity may reflect the bacterial\ncontact in the habitat to which the beetles, in contrast to the\nCalliphorids, are exposed.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank John Flynn for statistical advice\nand support.\nReferences\nArnaldos, M.I., Garcia, M.D., Romera, E., Presa, J.J. & Luna, A.\n(2005) Estimation of post-mortem interval in real cases\nbased on experimentally obtained entomological evidence.\nForensic Science International 149, 57\u201365.\nBexfield, A., Nigam, Y., Thomas, S. & Ratcliffe, N.A.
