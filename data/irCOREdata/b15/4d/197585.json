Geometric Chronophotography and the \nThin-Slicing of the Labouring Body \n \n \nThe First Law of Thermodynamics and the Search for Lost Time \nIn his best-selling book, Blink, Malcolm Gladwell (2006) invites us to consider the power \nof the unconscious in our decision-making. He argues that we often make crucial \nunconscious inferences in the first two seconds of our interactions with people and \nobjects. From Ambady and Rosenthal (1993), he borrowed the term 'thin-slicing' to \ndesignate this activity. The article you are now reading is also about 'thin-slicing', but the \nstory unfolds within a considerably thicker slice of time, and the slice in question, at half \na second, is significantly thinner than Ambady and Rosenthal\u2019s original slice of half a \nminute or the two second \u2018blink\u2019. Gladwell\u2019s book concerns itself with how the efficiency \nof human decision-making might be improved by an awareness of the power of the brief \ninterjection of the unconscious in our day-to-day thinking. This paper concerns itself with \nthe role of embodied unconsciousness in organisational behaviour, with an emphasis on \nthe efforts of scientists and managers to improve the efficiency of the ways in which \ngoods are produced and consumed in the modern world through the exploitation of that \nthin slice of time residing between sensation and consciousness. This paper explores how \nsome of the socio-economic, ideological and technological developments which began in \nthe nineteenth century have ushered in 'a micro-biopolitics, a new domain carved out of \nthe half-second delay which has become visible and so available to be worked upon \nthrough a new series of entities and institutions' (Thrift, 2004: 66).  \n Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was probably the first modern philosopher to identify \nthe \u2018blink\u2019. In the posthumous publication in 1765 of his New Essays on Human \nUnderstanding, he described the mind as a marriage of conscious and unconscious parts, \nand suggested that behaviour could be influenced by what he called minute perception - \nthat is, perception occurring outside of conscious awareness. However, this idea was not \ntaken seriously by philosophers or scientists for nearly 100 years, at which time the \nscientific quest to understand the phenomenon began in earnest. This quest to thin-slice \n 4 \ntime was propelled into Western cultural consciousness following a meeting in Paris \nbetween a German, a Frenchman and an Englishman - Hermann von Helmholtz, Etiennes \nJules Marey, and Eadward Muybridge - on the evening of September 26th 1881. Despite \nmeeting 125 years before the publication of Blink, these three men would have agreed \nwholeheartedly with Gladwell\u2019s contention that '[e]very moment \u2013 every blink \u2013 is \ncomposed of a series of discrete moving parts, and every one of those parts offers an \nopportunity for intervention, for reform and for correction' (2006: 241). The meeting in \nParis was arranged to debate precisely this issue. \n But our story begins in 1847 in the laboratory of the celebrated German physicist \nand physiologist, Hermann von Helmholtz. It was here that Helmholtz elaborated the \nuniversal law of the conservation of energy \u2013 the law we now refer to as the first law of \nthermodynamics \u2013 which argued that the forces of nature are forms of a single, universal \nenergy that can neither be created nor destroyed. In his public lectures and writings \nHelmholtz made it clear that all manifestations of nature obeyed this law. Echoing the \nmechanistic philosopher La Mettrie, he regarded the human body as itself an engine or \nmotor.  \nThe idea of work for machines, or natural processes, is taken from comparison with \nthe working power of man; and we can therefore best illustrate from human labour \nthe most important features of the question with which we are concerned... Now, \nthe external work of man is of the most varied kind as regards the force or ease, the \nform and rapidity, of the motions used on it, and the kind of work produced. But \nboth the arm of the blacksmith who delivers his powerful blows with the heavy \nhammer, and that of the violinist who produces the most delicate variations in \nsound, and the hand of the lace-maker who works with threads so fine that they are \non the verge of the invisible, all these acquire the force which moves them in the \nsame manner and by the same organs, namely, the muscles of the arms. An arm the \nmuscles of which are lamed is incapable of doing any work; the moving force of \nthe muscle must be at work in it, and these must obey the nerves, which bring to \nthem orders from the brain. That member is then capable of the greatest variety of \nmotions; it can compel the most varied instruments to execute the most diverse \ntasks...Just so it is with machines (Helmholtz, 1873: 64). \n 5 \n Three aspects of human labour power troubled Helmholtz. One was the fact that \nmuscles suffer from fatigue. The second was the time lag between an \u2018order\u2019 being \nreceived by the nerves and the execution of that order by the muscles. This phenomenon, \nwhich modern day physiologists explain in terms of \u2018axonal conduction velocity\u2019, \nHelmholtz (1850\/1948) called, more simply, an element of \u2018lost time\u2019. The third \ncontributory factor to the inefficiency of the body (the second element of lost time) \nHelmholtz discovered when studying reaction time - the time it takes a subject to respond \nto a consciously perceived stimulus \u2013 which he found to be far slower than even the \ncombined conduction times he had recorded for sensory and motor activities. Helmholtz \nargued that a great deal of brain processing must occur unconsciously before any \nconscious perception of an object. He therefore concluded that much of what goes on in \nthe brain is not represented in consciousness, but that the perception of objects depends \nupon 'unconscious inferences' made by the perceiver. If the body\u2019s lost time could be \nbrought to conscious awareness, measured, and analysed, Helmholtz believed that \nefficiency could be enhanced by the appropriate intervention, reform and correction.  \n It was these perceived inefficiencies of the human motor that heralded the search \nfor a more efficient conservation and use of energy - a search which, as Rabinbach (1990) \nargues, was to exert a profound influence on Western political and socio-economic \nideologies in the second half of the nineteenth century and beyond. Rabinbach deploys \nthe rather inelegant neologism of \u2018social Helmholzianism\u2019 to describe this 'program of \nsocial modernity that conceived of the working body as a system of economies of force \nand as the focal point for the new techniques that could eliminate social conflict whilst \nensuring productivity' (ibid. 120-1).  \n Unsurprisingly, the military were not slow to catch on to the potential benefits of \nsuch an ideology. For example, in the aftermath of France\u2019s defeat in the 1870-1 Franco-\nPrussian war, the work of the French physiologist Etiennes Jules Marey was sponsored \nby the French Ministry of War. The Minister of War held the view that the loss of the war \nwas due, at least in part, to the inefficient use of the energy contained in the bodies of \nFrench soldiers and horses. Energy was latent within all members of society and the \nMinistry was instructed to rebuild its physically and mentally demoralized population. \nThey believed that physiologists such as Marey should be at the centre of government-\n 6 \nsupported activity to help science bring the forces of nature and society under the control \nof the State. It is perhaps ironic that Marey\u2019s work should have been inspired by the \npioneering work of Helmholtz, who was a recipient of the Iron Cross in 1871 for his \ncontribution to the Prussian war effort. \n Before the war, Marey had been studying and researching muscular forces, as \nwell as working on physical education and gymnastics. He regarded Helmholtz\u2019s work on \nthermodynamics as 'the most remarkable theory of modern times' and set himself the goal \nof describing the economy of motion and to establish the laws of motion of the body. For \nMarey, Helmholtz\u2019s \u2018lost time\u2019 was the basic component of this economy and he hoped \nthat the graphical method favoured by both men would enable the direct measurement of \nphysiological time. 'All movement is the product of two factors: time and space; to know \nthe movement of a body is to know the series of positions which it occupies in space \nduring a series of successive instants' (Marey, 1878a: xi). The Frenchman distrusted any \nscience based on unaided visual perception and was particularly hostile to a physiology \nbased on vivisection. His graphical method enabled lost time to be recorded and corrected \nthrough 'the study in situ of living instruments'. According to Marey, the human \nsensorium was incapable of registering the fine movements of organic systems and so he \nargued that his mechanically produced graphic maps of the body possessed an objectivity \nthat unaided human perceptions did, indeed could, not.  \n His early work involved the use of various graphical inscription devices to capture \nbodily movement directly. For example, he developed the sphymograph which measured \nthe displacement of an artery wall at the pulse point of a wrist of a human body. A lever \nwas attached at one end of the pulse point and the other end at a stylus. The stylus was \nbrought into contact with a strip of smoke-blackened paper moved by a clockwork \nmechanism. The resulting graph measured the ebb and flow of arterial blood. Thus, the \nsphymograph, by measuring features of the pulse, translated the functions of the heart \ninto a graphic language. In 1871, Marey extended this graphical method to animal \nlocomotion and developed pneumatic techniques for transmitting information about \nchanges in the position and speed of a horse\u2019s hooves. This information was recorded on \na blackened cylinder strapped to the horse rider\u2019s back, and the results were graphically \n 7 \ndisplayed as a kind of musical notation indicating both time and space (see figure one). \nHe published his findings in the book La Machine Animale the following year. \n Meanwhile, in California, far from the horrors of the Franco-Prussian war, the \npresident of the US Central Pacific Railroad \u2013 Leland Stanford \u2013 was also developing an \ninterest in horses. On the advice of his doctor, Stanford, a former governor of the state of \nCalifornia, withdrew from active involvement in his railway business to pursue the \nsystematic acquisition, breeding, training, and racing of horses. In June 1870, he \npurchased a six year old gelding called Occident and set himself the challenge of making \nit the fastest race horse in the US. Along with Mark Hopkins, treasurer of Central Pacific \nRailroad, he began intensive research into equine anatomy and animal locomotion. The \ntwo men applied their findings rigorously and, within two years, Occident had earned a \nnational reputation for its endurance and speed on the race-track. \n \nFIGURE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \n Not one to rest on his laurels, Stanford was determined to increase the efficiency \nof his entire stable of racehorses. Crucial to such an endeavour was solving the problem \nof whether a speeding horse propelled itself by its hind quarters or by pulling itself by its \nfore quarters. Initially, he attempted to measure the depth of the impression left by a \nhorses\u2019 hooves on a smoothed sandy track, but results were difficult to decipher. But \nthen, in April 1872, his studies were given fresh impetus by his well-publicised \ninvolvement in a controversy which had been captivating horse racing enthusiasts in the \nUS for some time: was there a moment when all four feet of a racehorse were off the \nground? Marey\u2019s graphical notations of horse locomotion, published just months earlier, \ncertainly suggested to Stanford that this was the case ' (Muybridge, 1879: 246). However, \nthe results were inconclusive when applied to a horse moving at race track speed, and \nStanford resolved to use photography to provide the data necessary to settle the \ncontroversy. \n So it was in 1872 that the celebrated landscape photographer Eadward Muybridge \nwas commissioned to take the necessary photographs of Occident at Stanford\u2019s ranch in \nSacramento. At first, Muybridge had tried to expose photograph film manually by \n 8 \nsnatching the cap off the camera lens as the horse streaked past. After two days of trying, \nthe best photograph he could obtain was little more than a blurred shadow. On the third \nday, he rigged up a crude shutter made of two slats, tripped by a string running across a \ntrack at chest height. When the horse broke the string, the two slats slid in opposite \ndirections across the front of the camera--and for five-hundredths of a second, a gap \nopened that was sufficient to expose the film. This ingenious apparatus provided, in the \nwords of the Alta California newspaper, 'a great triumph as a curiosity in photography \u2013 a \nhorse\u2019s picture taken while going 38 feet in a second!' The photograph showed Occident \nwith all four hooves off the ground. As far as Muybridge was concerned 'the object of the \nexperiment was accomplished' (Muybridge, 1881: 13). However, not everyone was \nconvinced by the silhouette drawings derived from his series of twelve grainy \nphotographs and it wasn\u2019t until 1877 that Muybridge finally took a definitive series of \ntwelve 'instantaneous photographs' of Occident (which were duly rewarded with a medal \nfrom the jurors of the Twelfth Industrial Exhibition in San Francisco that November). \nThe influence of these photographs (shown in figure two) was destined to spread far \nwider than the West Coast horse racing fraternity. \n Back in France, Marey saw Muybridge\u2019 series of photographs of Occident in the \njournal La Nature, and immediately wrote to the editor:  \nI am lost in admiration over the instantaneous photographs of Mr Muybridge, \nwhich you published in your last number of La Nature. Can you put me in \ncorrespondence with the author? I want to beg his aid and support to solve certain \nphysiological problems so difficult to solve by other methods; for instance, the \nquestions connected with the flight of birds. I was dreaming of a kind of \nphotographic gun, seizing and portraying the bird in an attitude, or better still, a \nseries of attitudes, displaying the successive different motions of the wing. Cailletet \ninformed me that he had formerly essayed something similar, with encouraging \nresults. It is evident this would be an easy matter for Mr Muybridge to accomplish, \nand what beautiful zoetropes he could give us, and we could perfectly see the true \nmovements of all imaginable animals. It would be animated zoology (Marey, \n1878b: 29).  \n 9 \nFIGURE TWO ABOUT HERE \n Indeed, within six months the editors of both The Field (UK) and Scientific \nAmerican (US) magazines announced they had successful mounted Muybridge\u2019s pictures \nin a zoetrope. But it was Muybridge, in September 1879, who was to develop the most \nsophisticated way of projecting his photographic images onto a screen.  \nTo this instrument I gave the name of Zoopraxiscope; it is the first apparatus ever \nused, or constructed, for synthetically demonstrating movements analytically \nphotographed from life, and in its resulting effects is the prototype of all the various \ninstruments which under a variety of names, are used for a similar purpose at the \npresent day (Muybridge, 1881: 14).  \n As Robert Haas (1976: 120) observes, whilst not a completely new invention, the \nzoopraxiscope remained the only commercially demonstrated motion picture machine for \nmore than a decade, or at least until Thomas Edison mass \u2013produced his Kinetoscope, \nwhich was more viewer than a projector. The original projector survives and can be seen \nin the Library Museum in Muybridge\u2019s home town of Kingston-upon-Thames in the UK. \n When Marey heard of Muybridge\u2019s invention, he could scarcely contain his \nexcitement. Discovering that the Englishman was to embark on a European tour \ndemonstrating his photographs, Marey persuaded him to come to Paris so that he could \nsee the miracle of \u2018animated zoology\u2019 for himself. So it was that on the evening of \nSeptember 26th 1881, Marey threw a dinner party at which Muybridge, along with his \nzoopraxiscope, was the guest of honour. Hermann von Helmholtz also attended. Marey \nand Helmholtz were both committed to the use of graphical devices to measure motion, \nand both shared a frustration with the limitations and inaccuracies of their own \nchronographic devices. The readout from Helmholtz\u2019s kymograph, for example, captured \nthe minute movement of a frog\u2019s leg muscles but these could only be read via a \nmicroscope and he was obliged to make enlarged free-hand drawings of them. He much \npreferred the visual clarity of the images produced by the phenakistoscopes and rotating \nstroboscopic discs used in his studies of visual persistence (i.e. the tendency for the effect \nof a stimulus to remain visible after its extinction), but the results of these studies relied \non \u2018unscientific\u2019 and subjective self-reports. Like Marey, Helmholtz was keen to take the \n 10 \nhuman experimenter\/observer out of the experimental loop, and instantaneous \nphotography seemed to offer an elegant technological solution. \n The dinner party was remarkable enough to warrant three paragraphs in the \nFrench newspaper, La Globe. From the report we know that the guests were extremely \nimpressed by the zoopraxiscopic presentation \u2013 the apparently moving pictures \nsuggesting a \u2018d\u00e9fil\u00e9 diabolique.\u2019 Marey, in particular, was delighted that the show \nconcluded with the showing of a series of instantaneous photographs of birds in flight. By \nall accounts Helmholtz found the demonstrations riveting, but Marey has later to confess \nsome disappointment. The illusion of motion produced by the zoopraxiscope seemed to \nsimply reproduce what the unaided eye could already see (courtesy of the phenomenon of \nvisual persistence), whilst the individual photographs enabled temporal processes to be \nfixed and analysed to reveal phenomena invisible to the naked eye. This led Marey to a \nkeen interest in the movement between the photographs rather than the illusory motion \ncreated by their projection from Muybridge\u2019s new machine. The uncaptured instances \nbetween the photographs may reveal the secret of Helmholtz\u2019s \u2018lost time\u2019, and it was this \nthat Marey wanted to visualise, measure and analyse. He halted his graphical method \nstudies of motion and turned, with Muybridge\u2019s guidance, to his own brand of \ninstantaneous photography.  \n \nGeometric Chronophotography and the Regimentation of the Body \nMuybridge\u2019s photographs were taken by a series of twelve cameras which were \nsuccessively triggered by wires strung across the path of the moving horse or, more \nproblematically, across the flight path of a bird. But Marey, who had a lifelong interest in \naeronautics and the study of flight, felt that the tripping of wires was far too imprecise a \nmeasure of time and set about designing a more accurate, and faster, camera. By 1882, he \nhad perfected the photographic gun he had dreamt of four years earlier. This gun was a \nportable camera with a single circular revolving plate on which consecutive exposures \nwere recorded at precise intervals of time and distance. The resulting images did not \nproduce a series of photographs of the kind Muybridge was now famous for, but were \nrepresented as twelve overlapping images on a single photograph. Muybridge had \nsuccessfully achieved the decomposition of motion in his photographs, but Marey was \n 11 \nnow perfecting the decomposition of motion into even thinner slices of time. His new \nventure into what he termed chronophotography was to earn him a generous grant from \nthe French Ministry of War. The money from the Ministry (as well as a constant supply \nof volunteer infantry soldiers) enabled Marey to set up a new laboratory, the Station \nPhysiologique, in Paris. The Station was designed: 'to determine the series of actions \nwhich are created in human locomotion in its various types, to measure the effort \nexpended at each moment in the different actions of locomotion, in order to seek the most \nfavourable conditions for utilisation of that effort' (Marey, 1902: 34).  \n But Marey had a problem. Whilst Muybridge continued his instantaneous \nphotography in pursuit of artistic expression by increasing the number of cameras and \nthrough the filming of naked and semi-naked human models, Marey felt that his own \nphotographs contained too much information. With the shutter speed set too slow the \nimages were too blurred to measure; if set too fast the photograph contained far too many \noverlapping images. In 1883, he explained: 'in this method of photographic analysis the \ntwo elements of movement, time and space, cannot both be estimated in a perfect \nmanner. Knowledge of the positions the body occupies in space presumes that complete \nand distinct images are possessed; yet to have such images a relatively long temporal \ninterval must be had between two successive photographs. But if the notion of time one \ndesires to bring to perfection, the only way of doing so is to greatly augment the \nfrequency of images, and this forces each of them to be reduced to lines' (cited in Douard, \n1995:188). Striving for the simplicity and precision of his graphical method combined \nwith the speed and accuracy of chronophotography, Marey found the solution in what he \ncalled geometric chronophotography (see figure three): \nA man dressed completely in black, and consequently invisible upon the dead-black \nbackground, wears bright points and lines, strips of silver lace attached to his \nclothes along the axes of his limbs. When the man, so rigged, passes in front of the \napparatus, photographs will result that will be accurate diagrams to scale, showing \nwithout confusion the posture of upper and lower arms, thighs and lower legs, and \nfeet at each instant, as well as the oscillations of the head and the hips (Marey, \n1902: 323) \nFIGURE THREE ABOUT HERE \n 12 \n \n Through geometric chronophotography, Marey was able to decompose time into \nits \u2018elements\u2019. He created an empirical geometry to reveal how continuous motion is built \nup out of a discontinuous series of movements. For Marey, 'chronophotography renders \nvisible the normally invisible phases of motion or positions in space the body occupies. \nThe data furnished by chronophotography represent the real phases of movement, which \npersistence of vision represents as continuous duration: the fast shutter speeds decompose \nmovement that the eye cannot' (Douard, 1995: 195-6). Marey had finally discovered a \nway to visualise, capture, and measure Helmholtz\u2019s lost physiological time. Now all he \nhad to do was to reduce it. \n Armed with this new graphical language, geometric chronophotographic \nresearchers at the Station Physiologique were able to establish \u2018objective\u2019 rules governing \nthe manoeuvres of soldiers, and the physical exercises of young peoples: in short, to \nreveal the most efficient use of the muscular energy and effort of the human body. Marey \nwas also mindful of other domains where his methods could be put to use. In his book \nMovement (1875: 139), he opined that 'the same method could equally well be applied to \nthe teaching of movements necessary for the execution of various skilled industries. It \nwould show how the stroke of a skillful blacksmith differed from that of a novice. It \nwould be the same in all manual performances and in all kinds of sport.'  \n Marey discovered that even the most highly motor skilled of his photographic \nsubjects were not consciously aware of their own bodily movements. But his geometric \n\u2018chronographs\u2019 provided an immediate means for measuring and improving everyone\u2019s \nmotor skills \u2013 you simply had to study the pictures and learn to copy the representation of \nmovement, one \u2018element\u2019 at a time. Marey\u2019s chronographs contained information \npreviously hidden from both the observer and the subject. But if lost time could be \ncaptured with his pictures, they could also be used to instruct human subjects directly \nwithout recourse to the verbal or written language Marey so distrusted as a basis for \nscientific knowledge. For Marey, \u2018inefficient\u2019 unconscious inferences themselves could \nbe subsumed into conscious, rule-bounded behaviours through the mimetic application of \nchronographs. In this way, Tom Gunning (2002) argues that chronophotography worked \nas much to master motion as to portray it, achieving through this mastery the calculation \n 13 \nof the body itself, rendering visible its unseen motions, making evident its unconscious \nbehaviour. Marey\u2019s friend and colleague at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Henri Bergson, was \nequally dismayed at the way chronophotography reduced time to calculable space and \nsaw Marey\u2019s work as contributing to the subordination of human experience to an \nobjective and external measure (Bergson, 1911). \n Let us now return briefly to Gladwell\u2019s \u2018blink\u2019. The very notion of a thin slice of \ntime owes much to the work of nineteenth-century physiologists such as Helmholtz and \nMarey. But they showed that the \u2018blink\u2019 is not an action or property of the human eye, for \nthe phenomenon of visual persistence reveals that what the eye \u2018sees\u2019 when the eyelid is \nclosed is merely an after-image of what was \u2018seen\u2019 when the eyelids were open. The \n\u2018blink\u2019 is more the property of the opening and closing shutter of Muybridge\u2019s cameras. \nOf course, as Alan Sakula (1988) points out, 'the photograph, as it stands alone presents \nmerely the possibility of meaning' (p 91) and so interpreting photographs requires going \noutside the photographs themselves to ask where and how they were used, and how the \npeople who used them assigned them meaning. Although the technical prowess of Marey \nand Muybridge heralded the birth of cinematography as we now know it (and both men \nhad met Thomas Edison in the late 1880s to discuss possible collaborative projects), the \nmeaning of the thin slices of photographic time they captured was inextricably bound up \nwith the development of social Helmholzianism. \n Indeed, the chronophotographs of industrial hammerers taken by Marey\u2019s student \nCharles Fremont at the Station Physiologique in 1895 bear a striking resemblance to \nthose taken twenty years later by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth for their motion studies in \nthe US. The Gilbreths used a \u2018cyclograph\u2019 which comprised a series of light bulbs \nattached to a black suit worn over a workers body filmed in semi-darkness by a cine \ncamera. The resulting \u2018micromotion\u2019 pictures were then used to train workers in the \u2018one \nbest way\u2019 of working. Somewhat begrudgingly, Frank Gilbreth (1914) was to confess: \n\u2018\u2018Marey is the man whom I wish had not been born. He got a cyclegraph. He set up a \nrevolving disk with a hole in it before a camera, and he photographed this, and got a \nchrono-cyclegraph. We had to design a clock in order to photograph time in order to get a \nclock that would not jump. Marey\u2019s scheme was impractical, but he did the job, and he \ndid it first.\u2019\u2019 \n 14 \n Perhaps only within a discourse of social Helmholtzianism does the \u2018blink\u2019 \nbecome a domain of managerial practice, and one which can provoke Dagognet to see a \nkey role for Marey\u2019s ideas in the rapid proliferation of assembly lines and Taylorist \nexploitations in the twentieth century. 'It could be that he was also pushing toward \nrobotisation. It was less a man-machine or even a human machine that Marey wanted \nthan a machine capable of replacing man; who was considered a machine of low \nproductivity. It was enough to record and calculate the results of this machine to replace \nit with something better' (Dagognet, 1992: 170). It is undeniable that Marey favoured the \nuse of inscription technologies in his search for greater bodily efficiency. 'When the eye \ncease to see, the ear to hear, and the sense of touch or feel, or when our senses deceive \nus', he wrote, 'these instruments are like a new sense of an astonishing precision' (1878a: \n108). Of course, crucial to the successful deployment of geometric chronophonographical \ninstruments was the denial of the importance of both bodily experience and the body \nitself. Marey\u2019s two dimensional geometric chronographs showed only 'what was strictly \nnecessary' \u2013 by which he meant only those elements which could be presented on a \ngraph. Yet, through the medium of photography, Marey managed to persuade a wide \naudience that motion naturally had the structure of a graph. This was possible because, as \nmany researchers have noted, photography carried considerable evidentiary power in the \nlate nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (e.g. Sontag, 1978; Stange, 1989; Banta and \nHinsley, 1986; Barthes, 1981).  \nPhotography achieved compelling stature through its ability to preserve a specific \nmoment in time, an ability made even more believable by the contemporary iconic \nstatus of mechanical progress. Photographs, it was then argued (and is still often \nargued), recorded reality, and looking at a photograph told a viewer what things \nwere really like at the moment of its production. Studying them offered evidence of \nthe natural order of things not visible to the unassisted eye (Lindstrom, 2000: 734). \n In Marey's case, the analysis and reproduction of the nervous system require the \nintroduction of time as a function into the categories of representation. Most importantly, \nBraun (1994) argues, when inscription apparatuses begin to penetrate the time of the \nnervous system, the body loses its thickness and contours. In order to remove the 'imprint \nof flesh and skin so as to reveal the moving parts of the animate machine -- the joints, \n 15 \nlevers, and fulcrums, the rods, and pistons of the human body -- he Marey concocted a \nmoving skeleton, denuding the body of its flesh and volume' (Braun, ibid: 81). In Braun\u2019s \nview, the study of the body in motion had become the study of the decomposition of \nmoving corpses. Such studies, premised on the notion that the body will never be \n\u2018efficient\u2019 until it becomes consciously aware of its limitations, continue to the present \nday in ergonomic and human factors engineering laboratories throughout the world. \n \nPsychophysics and the Regimentation of the Mind \nBut if the body is in need of correction, what of the unconscious mind? What of \nunconscious inference, the second element of Helmholtz\u2019s lost time? Muybridge and \nMarey had little interest in mental processes and effectively evacuated the mind from the \nhuman \u2018motor\u2019. However, psychologists were keenly interested in the relationship \nbetween mind and body, and the introduction of Helmholtz\u2019s first law of thermodynamics \ninto psychology by Gustav Fechner in 1860 heralded the birth of psychophysics as a \ndiscipline combining psychological and physiological research on the human body with \nphysics. Psychophysics concerned itself with uncovering the physiological and \npsychological rules that govern mental activity and sensory perception. In short, Fechner \nand colleagues were searching for the physiological mechanism uniting the unconscious \nbody and the conscious mind. Fechner was aided on this search by Helmholtz and his \ndoctoral student, Wilhelm Wundt, who shared a fascination with the concept of \nunconscious inference. In their experiments on animals, Helmholtz and Wundt were able \nto thin-slice lost physiological time to 30 milliseconds, but did this instant of time have \nany psychological significance? The men were convinced that 'the will, the senses, the \nassociations and apperception all rigorously follow the principles of energy conservation' \n(Wundt, 1914: 900). Moreover, Fechner showed that mental events could not only be \nmeasured, but measured in terms of their relationship to real, physical events.  \n Fechner\u2019s psychophysical research on, and deep interest in, the unconscious may \nwell have passed quietly into obscurity were it not for the profound influence it had on a \nyoung neurology student attending his lectures at Leipzig University during the 1873-4 \nacademic year. The student\u2019s name was Sigismund Schlomo Freud (a name he changed \nto Sigmund Freud four years later). Freud was later to apply Helmholtz\u2019s first law of \n 16 \nthermodynamics to psychological phenomenon as he was convinced that it was emotional \nrather than muscular energy that held the key to understanding human behaviour. Like \nCharles Darwin, Freud perceived emotion as a form of physical energy which obeyed \nphysical laws, and like Wundt, he regarded conscious ideas as representations of physical \nforces.  \n In 1885, Freud moved to Paris to study with the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. \nFreud was immensely impressed by Charcot\u2019s work on traumatic hysteria and from it he \ndeveloped the idea that one of the principal forms of neurosis came about when a \ntraumatic experience led to the formation of unconscious symptoms. Freud based his \ntheory of psychodynamics on the recognition that memories repressed in the unconscious \ncreate increasing tension, and that this was relieved with dischargelike phenomena when \nthe unconscious was made conscious. Hence, 'psychic energy' can neither be created nor \ndestroyed, but can only be converted from one form to another. He suggested that \nnegative energy or anxiety from our childhood conflicts could not be destroyed, just as \nthe first law of thermodynamics would have it, but is pushed, or repressed, out of \nconscious awareness. The unconscious (or id) functions to contain such repressed wishes, \nand a (conscious) ego serves to guide and direct the expenditure of energy. Our instincts, \ncontained in the id, simply represent internal energy the ego must somehow channel and \nrelieve to restore \u2018psychic constancy\u2019 or \u2018neuronic inertia\u2019.  \n In his 1895 Project for a Scientific Psychology, Freud argued that the neuronal \nsystem held the key to understanding human behaviour and cognition. Neurons build up \nenergy which must be discharged when it goes beyond a tolerable level; pain is the \neruption of too much energy, whilst pleasure is the release of energy. Freud believed that \nwe all strive to keep energy at a minimum and thus our ultimate goal is achieving \npleasure and avoiding pain. When wishes that could lead to pain emerge, however, our \nunconscious defence mechanisms repress them. This unreleased energy is then often \ndisplaced through substitute wishes or it seeps out into our dreams. Failure to release this \nenergy could lead to the development of neuroses and mental instability. \n So, for Freud, the unconscious was far more than some kind of momentary \nmediator of perception which serves to reduce the efficiencies of the body. It was a \ncrucial component in all our behaviour, full of wishes, desires and needs having a \n 17 \nbiological and intra-psychological origin, which obey established physical laws. But it \ncould not be measured on a graph or photographed. Freud\u2019s psychotherapeutic techniques \nwere developed to reveal this unreleased energy and facilitate its release into conscious \nawareness through lengthy consultation with a qualified psychiatrist. \n \nThe Engineering of Consent and the Management of the Unconscious  \nFreud\u2019s work, of course, is most commonly associated with mental illness and the \n\u2018talking cure\u2019, and, for the best part of half a century, psychologists stayed well clear of \nhis ideas when studying \u2018normal\u2019 behaviour. Indeed, it wasn\u2019t until the late 1950s that the \nterm \u2018unconscious\u2019 appeared in mainstream US psychology texts (Greenwald, 1992), and \neven then it was primarily the focus of fierce criticism from empirical psychologists who \ncould not \u2018see\u2019 or measure it. But Freud had propelled the notion of the unconscious into \npopular consciousness and, in the US in the 1920s, two strands of applied psycho-\ndynamic psychology emerged which were to revolutionise the way the thin slice of the \nunconscious inference came to be understood and applied to business management \npractices. These two strands became known as human relations and public relations. \n Human Relations. Towards the end of the 1920s, the famous Hawthorne \nexperiments began at the Western Electric Company in Chicago. Although early research \nin the company focused on psycho-physiological and ergonomic aspects of work (e.g. the \neffect of changes in illumination on productivity), once the Australian psychologist Elton \nMayo became involved, the studies soon changed tack to concentrate on channeling the \nunconscious, emotional energy of manual workers towards higher productivity (Bruce, \n2006). With explicit reference to Freud (and implicit reference to Helmholtz\u2019s first law of \nthermodynamics), Mayo (1923a) believed that everyone has unconscious thoughts \n(\u2018unacknowledged reveries\u2019) which, if acknowledged, lead to self-awareness, social \nmaturity, and good citizenship. But, when these are not consciously acknowledged, they \nbecome \u2018negative reveries\u2019 which can fester into obsession, irrationality, and neurosis \n(Mayo, 1923b). The solution to such melancholia was counselling, and Mayo instigated \nan eight-year counselling and interviewing programme with 10,000 workers during the \nlater stages of the Hawthorne studies. The object of this programme was to \n\u2018acknowledge\u2019 the reveries of the workers by allowing them to express their frustrations \n 18 \nto a sympathetic counsellor, thereby reducing inner tension and at the same time \nmitigating the forces of industrial unrest (Roethlisberger & Dickson, 1939). \n Public Relations. Freud did not believe that the unconscious is restricted to \n\u2018primitive processing\u2019, or that \u2018higher order\u2019 thought is restricted to the conscious mind. \nFor example, in The Interpretation of Dreams he observed, 'the most complicated \nachievements of thought are possible without the assistance of consciousness' (1976: \n751). Freud\u2019s nephew Edward Bernays worked tirelessly to promote the application of \nthis idea to the practical business of social persuasion and propaganda in the United \nStates. In his hugely influential Crystallizing Public Opinion, Bernays (1923) argued that \nFreud\u2019s concept of the unconscious could, and should, be utilised by social elites to 'so \nmold the mind of the masses that they will throw their newly gained strength in the \ndesired direction' (p. 20). Governments and business corporations, he insisted, should \n'regiment the mind like the military regiments the body' (p. 21). Here Bernays is \npromoting the idea of regimenting the mind in precisely the same way as Marey and the \nGilbreths were seeking to regiment the body. The secret was to by-pass conscious \nawareness and appeal directly to those unconscious needs and desires his uncle had \nuncovered in his research.  \n Both Mayo and Bernays regarded the unconscious thought processes of the \nindividual as an obstacle to the betterment of democratic society. Edward Bernays\u2019 \n\u2018regimentation of the mind\u2019 is accomplished by what he termed the engineering of \nconsent. This is achieved through taking advantage of the unconscious mind\u2019s tendency \nto self-deception and of falling prey to the seductive power of a strong leader. Mayo held \na similar view, although he was more worried that industrial unrest was primarily caused \nby the seductive power that strong trade union leaders held over workers suffering from \nnegative revery (Gillespie, 1991). If all managers developed counselling skills to \ndissipate this unconscious energy, Mayo insisted, conscious reason would be restored, \nunion leaders would lose their power, and industrial unrest would be confined to the \ndustbin of history.  \n For many years, knowledge of the work of Mayo and Bernays was restricted to a \nfairly select band of academics and politicians. But, in the US, public awareness of the \nrole of the unconscious in decision-making and behaviour was aroused by the publication \n 19 \nin 1957 of Vance Packard's book, The Hidden Persuaders. In this best-selling book, \nPackard described many of the new motivational research marketing techniques (many of \nthem pioneered by Bernays) being employed to sell products to the American consumer. \nThat same year, a market researcher called James Vicary coined the term 'subliminal \nadvertising' to describe how consumer behaviour could be shaped by images flashed up \non a cinema or television screen so quickly that they fell far below the viewer\u2019s threshold \nof conscious awareness. Vicary conducted an experiment at a drive-in cinema in Fort \nLee, New Jersey to prove his point. He placed a tachistoscope in the cinema\u2019s projection \nbooth, and throughout the playing of the film Picnic, he flashed a couple of different \nmessages on the screen every five seconds. The messages were each displayed for only \n1\/300th of a second at a time. The result of displaying the imperceptible suggestions -- \n'Drink Coca-Cola' and 'Hungry? Eat Popcorn' - was an 18% increase in Coca-Cola sales, \nand a 58% surge in the sale of popcorn to the audience. Whilst Marey had analysed the \ngaps in between his photographic images in order to bring to conscious awareness the lost \ntime the eye could not see, Vicary placed a message in these gaps which the eye could \nsee, but the conscious mind could not.  \n The public outcry fuelled by Packard\u2019s book and Vicary\u2019s experiment was such \nthat the US Federal Communications Commission came under intense pressure to ban \nsubliminal advertising from radio and television. A ban was finally instigated on January \n24th, 1974 following an announcement by the FCC that subliminal techniques, 'whether \neffective or not,' were 'contrary to the public interest,' and that any broadcasting station \nemploying them risked losing their licence to broadcast. Although Vicary admitted in \n1960 that he had falsified his research results in order to publicise his marketing business, \nthe idea that corporations or governments might be controlling the unconscious minds of \nconsumers and citizens resonated strongly with the Cold War paranoia of the time.  \n Within academia, the consequent rise of what Pratkanis (1992) has called the \n\u2018cargo-cult science of subliminal persuasion\u2019 served to put Helmholtz\u2019s \u2018lost time\u2019 firmly \nback on the experimental research agenda. Then, in 1979, the neuroscientist Benjamin \nLibet announced the results of his experimental study of unconscious inferences. His \nresults rocked the scientific and philosophical academies to the core. Libet based his \nstudy on the psychophysiological work of Kornhuber and Deeke (1965). Kornhuber and \n 20 \nDeeke asked volunteers to move their right index finger and then measured this voluntary \nmovement with a strain gauge whilst simultaneously recording the electrical activity of \nthe brain by means of an electrode on the skull. They discovered that each movement was \npreceded by a brief upsurge of electrical activity in the brain. They called this the \n'readiness potential' and found that it occurred approximately one second before the \nvoluntary movement. Libet followed up this study with an experiment in which he asked \nvolunteers to lift a finger whenever they felt the urge to do so. He placed an electrode on \na volunteer's skull and confirmed a readiness potential about one second before the \nperson lifted his or her finger. He then compared the time it took for the person to will the \nmovement with the time of the readiness potential. To his amazement, Libet found that \nthe readiness potential appeared not after, but 200 milliseconds before his subjects felt the \nurge to move their finger. Thus, by observing the electrical activity of the brain on a \ngraphical device (an electroencephalograph, or EEG), Libet was able to predict what his \nsubjects would do before they were consciously aware of having decided to act.  \n Now, whilst many commentators have questioned the conclusions Libet drew \nfrom this and subsequent experiments (specifically regarding the status of free will), they \nare in general agreement that 'voluntary acts are nonconsciously initiated' (Gomes, 1998: \n591). More specifically, there is approximately a half-second delay between a bodily \naction and becoming consciously aware of that action, between setting an act in motion \nand our decision to do so. What an opportunity, perhaps, for mnemotechnical \nmanagement through insinuating a product or instruction in this tiny gap between the \nunconscious and conscious awareness. After all, as Nietzsche (1990: 112) has argued, 'a \nmere disciplining of thoughts and feelings is virtually nothing, one first has to convince \nthe body. In two or three generations everything is already internalised. It is decisive for \nthe future of nations and of mankind that one should inaugurate culture in the right place \n\u2013 not in the soul. The right place is the body, demeanour, diet, physiology: the rest \nfollows'. \n \nConclusion: Towards a Neuro-Scientific Management? \nFrom the mid-19th century on, new forms of calculation in sensory registers developed \nwhich were not previously regarded as \u2018political\u2019. This paper has outlined three technical \n 21 \ndevelopments which were fundamental to the growth of what Thrift (2004) terms \u2018micro \nbiopolitics\u2019. First, the development of graphical devices and instruments enabled the \nsmall spaces of the body to become visible and measurable. Second, the development of \nchronophotography enabled the smallest and fastest of bodily movements to be seen, \nrecorded, and manipulated. Third, the development of the technical means to manage \nknowledge of unconscious actions (e.g. via time and motion study, counselling, and \nadvertising) has enabled the reterritorialisation of behavioural control away from the \nlabouring body to the dictates of mindful management. All three of these developments \nneed to be seen in the context of a discourse of the labouring body epitomised by \u2018social \nHelmholzianism\u2019 which renders the embodied unconscious amenable to correction.  \n More than 100 years after the meeting in Paris between Helmholtz, Marey, and \nMuybridge, after the birth of psychophysics, and after Freud\u2019s initial conceptualisation of \nthe unconscious; mainstream cognitive psychology has finally woken up to the fact, long-\naccepted and exploited by business and political elites (and behavioural psychologists), \nthat the embodied unconscious plays a key role in shaping human behaviour. Just as \nMarey\u2019s chronophotography reduced the body to a basic motor and skeletal line drawing, \nthe deeper workings of our unconscious sensorium are now being reduced to graphical \nand photographic images by cognitive scientists armed with ever sophisticated \ntechnologies of representation and measurement.  \n There is now growing evidence that businesses are eager to exploit more fully the \nunconscious influences of the senses of sound (Corbett, 2003a, 2003b) and smell (Bone \nand Ellen, 1999; Corbett, 2006), as well as the sensorium more generally (Howes, 2004; \nLindstrom, 2005 ) on employee and consumer behaviour. This raises the spectre of new \nforms of organisational practices based on a nascent 'neuro-scientific management', \naimed at the exploitation of the micro biopolitics of work behaviour. Yet, whilst the \ninfluence of Taylorism of management thinking and organisational behaviour has been \nendlessly debated in management and organisation studies, the role of applied \nphysiologists, whose work reflected and reinforced an ideology of 'social \nHelmholzianism', has received rather less attention.  \n \n \n 22 \nReferences \nAmbady, N. and Rosenthal, R.
