Development aspects of the processing route are presented here. \n \nKeywords: Pyroelectric Array, Micromachining, corona poling. \nAIP:77.70.+a   77.84.Dy  52.80.Hc  87.80.Mj \nIntroduction \nTypical commercial versions of arrays of pyroelectric detectors are manufactured from bulk \nceramic materials which are lapped and polished, laser machined to thermally isolate the \nelements and flip-chip bonded to silicon chip circuitry. Work at Cranfield is being \nundertaken to develop a pyroelectric array, which incorporates within its structure an array \nof radiation collectors via a silicon wafer processing route. \nSilicon Wafer Processing \nFigure 1 shows the schematic drawing of the early prototype array structure where simple \nradiation collectors have been formed by the anisotropic etching of silicon as pyramidal \nwells by tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Corona poling potentially offers a \npractical route to poling large areas of thin film PZT samples particularly where the presence \nof pinhole defects prevents the use of conventional contact poling methods. Figure 2 \nsummarises the two multiple pin poling set-ups investigated for the poling of 100mm PZT \ncoated substrates. \nCorona Poling \nQualitative experimental observations showed that no poling occurred without an audible \ncorona \u201chiss\u201d. For an initial fixed height of h=~15mm, the corona discharge field was \nsmaller for the higher pin density case. However, on viewing the visible discharge in the \ndark for this set-up, it was evident that only the outermost pins were discharging. For the low \npin density case all the pins showed a discharge at this height. When the height was reduced \nto ~9mm, all the pins in both the low and high density cases were seen to discharge. The \nobservation of visible cloudy areas on the sample coincident with the corona pin positions \nwas the first evidence of poling. This was shown to be microcracking within the PZT \nprobably as a result of stress. However, in large areas, it was still possible to measure array \nelements which showed the characteristic decrease in dielectric constant associated with \npoling, compared to the unpoled state. \n \nSilicon Anisotropic Wet Etching Criteria \n \nTo achieve an acceptable etch rate (25\u03bcm\/hr.) of silicon and because the use of Apiezon\u2122 \nwax to protect the back face processing limited the etch temperature to ~70\u00b0C, a 12.5wt% \naqueous TMAH solution was required. Initial etch runs suggested that degradation effects \nfrom the wax reaction with the TMAH was effecting the uniformity of the etch. Subsequent \nencapsulation of the edge of the sample with silicone rubber prevented degradation of the \nwax. The flow of the etchant over the array was an important criteria also to maintain \nuniformity of etch, across the high density of 16x16 elements per array. The best uniformity \nwas achieved by orienting the sample at 45\u00b0face down towards the stirring rod. \nIdeally, for the pyramidal wells to act as radiation collectors they should have smooth walls. \nThe initial 12.5wt% TMAH solution achieved an acceptable etch rate, but the walls showed \na crater-like topology, as well as a significant undercut of the SiO2 mask. Work by Tabata et. \nal. (1) had reported that using TMAH solutions above 22wt% produced a smooth wall etch, \nalthough at  70\u00b0C the etch rate was relatively slow. As a result, a two step etch process was \napplied to the array structures involving an initial slow ~10\u03bcm etch in a 25wt% TMAH \nsolution followed by the 12.5wt% etch to completion. Figure 3 shows the improvement in \nwall smoothness achieved by the two step etch. The undercut of the SiO2 was also controlled \nproducing uniform apertures and membranes, and a reduction of wall failures between \nneighbouring elements. \nConclusions \nThe multipin corona poling set-up has proved successful at poling intact localised areas of \nPZT, but has introduced development issues. Apart from the set-up requiring identical pins \nset at an identical height, there seems to be a relationship between pin separation(density) \nand height above sample, which effects the uniformity of discharge across the sample. This \nneeds to be addressed to reduce undesirable microcracking across the sample. Development \nof a two step TMAH silicon etch process has proved successful in producing a uniform etch \nacross an array of 16x16 elements. Identical pyramidal radiation collectors are required to \nallow comparative future testing. \n \nReferences \n1.
