Students on this course learn the basic principles of\nthe increasingly important subject of structural biology using software programs such as\nRasmol and Chime to visualize and manipulate molecular structures in three dimensions.\nThey interact with their tutors, based at Birkbeck, using email and text-based\nteleconferencing, and can test their knowledge with multiple choice quizzes on the Web.\nOver 200 students from thirty countries registered for this course in the last four years.\nForty, from central and eastern Europe, were supported by bursaries from the Open\nSociety Institute. The course has been well received by students and its success led us to\nintroduce a similar course in protein crystallography.\nIntroduction\nThe Internet is becoming an important medium for the delivery of educational materials.\nHowever, relatively few institutions are delivering whole courses using this medium. More\noften, the technologies are used to complement traditional courses, which may be given\nface-to-face or at a distance (Farrell, 1999). The Department of Crystallography at\nBirkbeck College, London, has been in the vanguard of the development of 'virtual\neducation', providing some of the first accredited postgraduate courses in the UK to be\noffered entirely using the new technologies. For the past four years, we have been running\nan Advanced Certificate course entitled 'Principles of Protein Structure using the\nInternet'1 (Sansom, Walshaw and Moss, 1997) (PPS). See http:\/\/www.cryst.bbk.aauk\/pps\nfor more details. This was one of the first tutor-assisted, accredited, university-level courses\nto be taught entirely over the Internet, and is certainly the first in biochemistry in the UK.\n29\nClare Sansom and David Moss Principles of protein structure: an established Internet-based course in biology\nIn 1997 the first delivery of the accredited course was granted an award from the\nUniversities and Colleges Information Systems Association (UCISA) for innovative use of\nthe Web in higher education. The PPS course is of nine months' duration, and of final-year\nundergraduate standard, although almost all students are graduates. Successful students\nreceive the award of an Advanced Certificate from London University, which is a graduate\nlevel qualification approximately equivalent to half a UK M.Sc. degree. The success of the\nPPS course has encouraged the department to introduce a second Advanced Certificate, in\nProtein Crystallography, taught in this way.\nOur students, who may come from any country, can study at home, at work or at college,\nand set their own hours of study. This is self-evidently also true for more conventional\ntypes of distance education, delivered through paper-based and broadcast media. How-\never, this way of providing education differs from traditional types of distance learning in\nthat both delivery of course material and student-tutor interactions take place using only\nInternet and associated multimedia technologies. Students are expected to have regular\naccess to a computer with a reliable Internet connection and access to the Web via a\nmodern graphical browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer version 3 or 4. Currently,\nwe support students using PC, Macintosh and Unix platforms. The minimum acceptable\nspecification is kept fairly low; a 486 or an equivalent machine of another platform is\nsufficient. This technology is readily and fairly cheaply available almost everywhere in the\nworld. Most of our students use PCs, or Unix workstations from Sun and Silicon\nGraphics, and these are the best supported by the technical staff at Birkbeck. We\ndeliberately chose to keep the minimum specification low and to allow students choice of\nseveral platforms, although this has limited our choice of software. The benefit of this, of\ncourse, is in increasing access to the course for a wide range of students.\nAlthough all the course tutors are based at Birkbeck, the students also benefit from the\ninvolvement of a group of consultants. These people are usually academics from the UK\nor abroad who conduct tutorials on specialized topics in the syllabus and are available to\nanswer students' questions by email. Some consultants have also assisted in the electronic\nadministration of the courses.\nThe developments that led to the PPS course started in 1993, with the production of\nsoftware for the display of macromolecular structure for teaching crystallography at\nBirkbeck. The growing popularity of the Web led to the next step: the idea of delivering\nthis software over the Web for students' use away from Birkbeck. A pilot version of the\nPPS course was launched early in 1995 to evaluate the possibilities of these technologies\nfor the delivery of a full-scale course. The success of this led to the launch of the accredited\ncourse, in 1996. A total of 252 students have registered for the accredited course in the five\nyears that it has been running. Our students have come from thirty countries, covering\nevery continent except Africa. Just over 30 per cent (seventy-nine) are women; nine were\nover fifty-five when they started the course. The drop-out rate for the accredited courses\nhas been low. In order to be accepted for an Advanced Certificate, students need a UK\nbachelor's degree in any science subject or its equivalent. A few undergraduate students\nhave been accepted on the courses. These are usually from central European countries,\nwhere some undergraduate programmes are up to five years long and lead to the award of\nthe equivalent of a master's degree.\n30\nALT-} Volume 8 Number 2\nSyllabus and assessment\nThe choice of bioinformatics and protein structure, including crystallography, as the core\nscientific subjects taught reflects the growing importance of these subjects to industry.\nStructures of protein molecules are now being determined at an accelerating rate, driven by\ntechnological improvements and increased investment in molecular biology through\ngenome projects. The design of novel drugs and vaccines depends on an understanding of\nthe details of the relationships between protein sequence, structure and function. The\npharmaceutical and biotechnology industries increasingly need personnel trained to a high\nstandard in these interdisciplinary subjects. What was, only ten years ago, an esoteric sub-\ndiscipline is becoming a necessary part of modern biology. Bioinformatics and structural\nbiology are becoming 'core skills' for graduate biologists, and the pace of technological\nchange is such that lifelong learning must become part of the culture. The syllabus of the\nPPS course addresses the skill shortage in this area by introducing graduate students, and\nupdating inexperienced scientists, in the knowledge and skills needed to take part in\nstructural molecular biology research. It starts with an introduction to the use of Internet\ntools and protocols, followed by basic protein structure, protein synthesis, elementary\nbioinformatics (DNA and protein sequence analysis) and the relationship between protein\nstructure and function.\n;%< Netscape-\nFigure I: Screen-shot illustrating a Protein Identification Quiz used for self-assessment in the 1998-9\nversion of the Principles of Protein Structure course.\n31\nClare Sansom and David Moss Principles of protein structure: an established Internet-based course in biology\nFormal assessment of the PPS course consists of an examination and a project. The\nexamination is the only part of the course that is not Internet-based. This is conducted\nalong the same lines as the UK's Open University examinations but on a much smaller\nscale. Students attend in person at one of a number of local centres temporarily established\nthroughout the world. This is an important means of verifying the students' identities. The\nproject consists of a simple resource written in HTML to present and explain some aspect\nof protein structure. We emphasize that the students are not expected to become experts in\nWeb design and programming, just to learn enough HTML to present an attractive and\nwell-linked electronic review. Some example projects are mounted on the Web to give\nfuture students an idea of what is expected.\nStudents also benefit from exercises set throughout the course, which do not contribute to\ntheir assessment. Tutors may use the interactive and multimedia functionality of the Web\nto set course-work exercises containing, for example, images of protein structures which\nthe students are expected to manipulate. Answers to questions may be submitted via email\nor hypertext forms. This electronic submission of answers permits automatic checks to be\nmade on student progress. Each student on the protein crystallography course is assigned a\nseparate user identifier, which they use to run calculations on the central computer\nfacilities at Birkbeck, both for self-assessment and for their project work. We have also pro-\nvided multiple-choice quizzes with instant feedback as self-assessment exercises (Figure 1).\nInternational implications\nAccess to PPS and the other Internet-based Advanced Certificate courses is extremely\nvaluable in countries where the techniques of bioinformatics and structural biology are\nrelatively poorly developed. Many countries in central Europe, which are currently\npreparing for entry to the European Union, are particularly well placed to benefit from\nthese courses. Although the first protein crystallography laboratories opened in Poland and\nHungary in 1994, these countries still suffer badly from skill shortages in these subjects. A\ncrystallography group was formed in Prague (Czech Republic) in 1998. Although the\neconomies of these countries are growing, disciplines such as crystallography have not yet\ndeveloped to a point where students can readily access training programs locally.\nOne advantage of distance education is that students from emerging economic areas can\ntake part in western higher education programmes at a fraction of the cost of travelling to,\nand living in, western countries. The level of technology required to benefit from the\nBirkbeck courses is increasingly available throughout less developed regions, particularly\ncentral Europe and the former Soviet Union, South America and parts of east Asia.\nHowever, the fees introduced for the accredited course, although much lower than those for\nsimilar, traditional courses, effectively denied access to these students. Birkbeck College\nwas awarded a two-year grant from the Open Society Institute that enabled it to offer\nbursaries to about twenty students from central Europe and the former Soviet Union in\n1997 and again in 1998. Although the fees for students located outside the 'western world'\nhave now been reduced to the level paid by UK- or EU-based students, the loss of the\nbursaries has led to a serious decline in student numbers in the 1998-9 academic year.\nThree students from Poland and one from the Czech Republic are currently taking the\ncourses. We are currently exploring other possibilities for supporting students from these\nregions.\n32\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nEnabling technologies\nThe use of the Web as a tool to deliver educational materials and email discussion lists for\nasynchronous communication between tutors and students are well-established techniques\nin distance learning. A large proportion of the course material has been developed 'in-\nhouse' (see Figure 2 for an example). Much 'legacy material', prepared for conventional\nteaching at Birkbeck, has been rewritten for the Web (King, 1998). This process, although\nstraightforward, is fairly time-consuming. We also provide access to high-quality tutorial\nor reference material relevant to the syllabus available elsewhere on the Internet. We have\neliminated potential copyright problems by referencing the material using hypertext links,\nwith the permission of the authors. Messages on the lists are placed in an archive\ncatalogued according to date and topic. Students can review these archives and follow\ndiscussions that have taken place earlier in the course. The unique mixture of technologies\nused in this course also includes molecular visualization software and a text-based\nnetworked virtual environment (TNVE) as a synchronous communication tool for\ntutorials.\nThe study of three-dimensional protein structure is made easier by being able to rotate\ncolour images of the molecules on the computer screen. In PPS we provide viewing\nsoftware such as Rasmol (Sayle, 1999) and associated scripts that enable students to rotate\nRichardsoa (1981) aaraes fee aipba\/beta. stnxtar.i\nsecondary ssuctses fonas a paraEel arraagemea\nSad 'psrs&ci aS 2%>ia\" (zipaa-aJpha-aipha sub\u00abi\nnumbers, but these do aot occw.

Rasmol is readily accessible over the Internet, can be\neasily installed on a wide variety of computer platforms and, importantly, it is free. We are\ngradually increasing our use of the Web plug-in, Chime, which is partly based on Rasmol.\nChime is an important teaching resource as it is relatively straightforward to combine with\nJavascript to produce interactive tutorials (MDLI, 1999). Unfortunately, as later versions\nare only available for the Windows and Mac operating systems, we will not be able to\nreplace Rasmol with Chime if we wish to carry on supporting students using Unix\nworkstations. Molecular movies are very useful for helping students gain an understanding\nof complex molecular processes such as muscle contraction. Students also use the program\nMage to display interactive diagrams or 'kinemages' illustrating protein structure,\n34\nALT-} Volume 8 Number 2\nincluding those produced for use with the excellent textbook Introduction to Protein\nStructure (Branden and Tooze, 1999).\nInteractive tutorials, which are run using a MUD (a Multi-User Dimension) or a MOO (an\nobject-oriented MUD) are a popular feature of the course. When a tutor (usually based at\nBirkbeck) and a group of students (who may be scattered throughout the world) are\nconnected simultaneously to such a system, the tutor can write text which the students can\nsee almost instantaneously and reply in real time. For the first four years of the course, we\nused 'BioMOO' (Sansom, 1997; Towell and Towell, 1997), which is mounted at the\nWeizmann Institute in Israel. Figure 3 shows a dialogue taken from a real tutorial held in\nBioMOO in the 1998-9 PPS course. We have now set up a simple MUD at Birkbeck\nCollege for the exclusive use of students and tutors on Birkbeck's courses. Both the tutor\nand students may simultaneously display Web pages showing an assignment that forms the\nbasis of the tutorial discussion.\nWeb communication can suffer from delays due to network congestion, particularly for\ntraffic across the Atlantic. This is particularly important in countries with relatively poor\nnetwork connections. Internet connections between Poland and the rest of the world\nbecame extremely slow during 1998 and part of 1999, due to network congestion in\nWarsaw. This problem has only recently been resolved (Sansom, 1999). In previous years\nwe have taken up offers from other institutions to mirror our course materials in order to\nminimize these problems. These sites took nightly updates of the PPS course and in\naddition to providing faster Web communication, the mirrors give insurance against\ncomputer or network failures. However, since the teaching material for both courses is now\npassword-protected, which makes mirroring technically harder, the mirrors have been\nremoved. We hope to be able to reinstate at least the Polish mirror (at the Poznan\nSupercomputer Centre), which would make it easier for central European students to\nfollow the courses.\nEvaluation\nAt the end of 1998 we sent a questionnaire (Table 1), by email, to all 194 students who had\ntaken the course during its first three years. The limitation of this means of\ncommunication is simply that many people change email addresses often, and at least forty\nquestionnaires failed to reach their destinations. Therefore, the forty-five responses\nreceived represent a minimum 29 per cent response rate (45\/154). Of the replies, nine (12\nper cent of 75) came from students completing the course in 1996, 14 (26 per cent of 53)\nfrom those completing in 1997 and 21 (32 per cent of 66) from those completing in 1998.\nThis improvement in response rate with students taking later courses probably just\nunderlines the fact that students from earlier courses are more likely to have changed email\naddresses since completion.\nA large majority of students agreed with positive statements about the course. Eighty-\nseven per cent of the respondents (thirty-nine students) claimed that the course had\n'broadly speaking' lived up to their expectations, and 80 per cent would recommend it to\ntheir colleagues. Many had already done so. Sixty-nine per cent agreed with the statement\nthat the course was value for money. It is possible, however, that there was an element of\nself-selection, with those students who gained most from the course being most likely to\n35\nOare Sansom and David Moss Principles of protein structure: an established Internet-based course in biology\nQuestion\nWhich Advanced Certificate course did you take?

This is a common feature of distance learning, but with the PPS\ncourse it was exacerbated by a lack of staff time. For many reasons most students found it\ndifficult to attend tutorial sessions. Only 36 per cent of students reported having attended\nthese 'regularly'. There are many reasons for this: difficulty in scheduling meetings\n(particularly for students based outside Europe and the Americas); other commitments;\nlack of confidence with written English at speed; and technical difficulties. A small\nminority of students, particularly those working in industry, has been unable to attend any\ndue to 'firewalls'. Not all students have been happy to post scientific questions to the public\nmailing lists. The only other direct interaction between the students and their tutors occurs\nduring the self-assessment periods. We have increased these from one to three a year, but it\nwould be difficult to increase interaction with students beyond this without a significant\nfurther investment of staff time.\nWhen prompted with a list of possible problems, 'finding time to follow the course' and\n'network speed' were cited by more than half the students (Figure 4). A far higher\nproportion of students from central Europe than others found speed a problem; 73 per\ncent [11\/15] of students supported by bursaries, compared with 40 per cent [12\/30] of\nothers mentioned that they had had problems with this. The mirror site in Poznan was\nremoved when password protection of course material was introduced, and the Polish\nnetwork infrastructure outside Warsaw was degraded in early 1998 due to competition\nbetween service providers (Sansom, 1999). This combination of circumstances caused\nPolish students taking the course in 1998-9 particular difficulties.\n37\nOare Sansom and David Moss Principles of protein structure: an established Internet-based course in biology\nFuture developments\nThere are still some legal, technical and administrative problems that are hindering the\nwholesale acceptance of these teaching methods. One of the most serious of these concerns\nstudent assessment - when students and tutors never meet face to face, it is much harder to\nguard against plagiarism, or students collaborating on assignments - or even to ensure that\nthe students registered on the course are those who take the examination. Issuing students\nwith individual passwords, which is necessary for protein crystallography students, may be\none way to minimize the risks. The qualification offered, the Advanced Certificate, is also\nmuch less well known than, for instance, the M.Sc, which is an international standard.\nMany potential students, particularly those located outside the UK, are unaware of the\nlevel of qualification it represents. Although Internet bandwidth is increasing rapidly, the\nequally rapid increase in 'traffic' means that communication delays are unlikely to improve\nmuch in the foreseeable future.\nRecent hardware and software developments are already affecting the quality of our\neducational material and the ways in which the tutors, consultants and students can\ncommunicate. Applications written in Java can be used directly, over the Internet, on a\nvariety of hardware platforms without needing installation. One example, CINEMA\n(Parry-Smith, Payne, Michie and Attwood, 1998) (a tool for aligning protein sequences), is\ncurrently used in the course. As network bandwidth increases, MOO-type programs will\nincreasingly incorporate 'shared whiteboards' which will allow dispersed groups of people\n- for example, a tutorial group or a group of academic collaborators working on a paper -\nto make changes to the same document in 'real time'. We are also investigating the\nsimultaneous use of audio communication. Use of the higher bandwidth communication\nprovided by ISDN or cable to provide audio and video may enable us to verify student\nidentity locally.\nWe are gradually extending the range of subjects that we offer at Advanced Certificate level\nusing this technology. We have just introduced a third Advanced Certificate, in Powder\nDiffraction, and we hope to introduce a fourth, Techniques in Structural Molecular\nBiology, during 2001. We are also intending to introduce an Internet-based part-time\nmodular M.Sc. course, which will be built up from the Advanced Certificates. Most\nstudents would take the PPS course in the first year of M.Sc. study, followed by one of the\nmore advanced courses. Students may also be required to submit a project.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Dr Huub Driessen for useful discussions.\nReferences\nBranden, C. and Tooze, J.
