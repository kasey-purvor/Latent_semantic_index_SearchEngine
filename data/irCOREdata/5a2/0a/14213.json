Anonymous student feedback is presented and analyzed with respect to the\nperceived benefits of using the system with respect to enhancing the student learning\nprocess.\nIntroduction\nThis paper describes the use of anonymous discussion within the use of computerized peer-\nassessment, and reports on student feedback concerning the perceived benefits to the\nlearning process that the use of this system has produced. The merits, and demerits, of peer-\nassessment have been researched and well documented over a number of years (Boud,\nCohen and Sampson, 1999; Dochy, Segers and Sluijsmans, 1999; Falchikov, 1995; Stefani,\n1994). Peer assessment provides a means of encouraging students to reflect on the quality of\ntheir own work whilst marking the work of their peers. It must be seen to provide a means of\nenhancing the learning process, not merely reducing a tutor's marking load. This paper is\nnot an attempt to evaluate the use of peer-assessment, but is intended to identify an aspect\n41\nPhil Davies Closing the communications loop on the computerized peer-assessment of essays\nof this assessment method that has often been disregarded, namely the possibility of peer\ndiscussion on feedback. Discussion on feedback is normally impossible due to the very\nnature of anonymity that is associated with 'fair' peer-assessment. If anonymity is not\npresent, then external factors can influence the grades\/marks produced, as noted by Pond,\nUl-Haq and Wade (1995), which 'can be adversely influenced by group collusion, friendship\n(or hostility) and can allow, and even encourage, domination by individuals'.\nThe use of computerized systems to support peer-assessment is still in its relative infancy\n(Davies, 2000; Bhalerao and Ward, 2001; Dennis and Dempster, 2000; Bostock, 2001; Lin,\nLiu and Yuan, 2001). The de-personalization caused by the use of such systems has\nobviously reduced the tutor-student contact with response to feedback. It has been noted\nthat learning depends on feedback to the learner (Falchikov, 1995). However, it has also\nbeen noted that opportunities for traditional tutor feedback are becoming fewer, it is more\nand more difficult to maintain levels and quality of feedback (Falchikov, 1995) and\ndetailed feedback on students' work has been substantially eroded (Race, 1995).\nConstructive feedback is of utmost importance in enhancing the learning process, and\noften the student receives a grade or mark which is little use in directly helping a student in\nthe learning process (Miller, Imrie and Cox, 1998), but in order for it to be effective and\nfair, it needs to be uniform, whereas, as Falchikov (1995) comments: 'tutors may not feel a\nneed to produce detailed formative feedback for students whose grades are satisfactory or\nof a high standard.'\nAs noted by Higgins, Hartley and Skelton (2002), whether a tutor provides such feedback\nor not is no longer an option: it is considered to be essential and often part of the student\ncharter, higher education as a 'service', and it is felt that feedback constitutes part of that\nservice.\nIt should be noted that, in any argument concerning whether a student is capable of\nproviding constructive comments to their peers, not all tutor comments are necessarily\nhelpful, as reported by Miller et al. (1998): 'I am returning this otherwise good typing\npaper to you, because someone has printed gibberish all over it, and put your name at the\ntop of it' (attributed to a professor from Ohio University).\nThis form of destructive comment does not leave the student in any doubt as to the quality\nof their work, but gives little guidance as to how they can improve their work in future.\nThis must be balanced against the opposite feedback of superfluous glowing praise, with\nno guidance on future improvements that will enable him or her to work on points in need\nof attention rather than to keep practising points of strength (Brown and Knight, 1994). It\nmay also be proposed that a tutor will provide comments to placate a student, rather than\nproduce controversial comments that could result in the need for further time-consuming\nconsultations.\nAs previously stated, peer feedback is normally anonymous (Pond et al., 1995), and\nbecause of this there is a problem of a student being able to clarify any issues concerning\nthe feedback they receive for their work. For the feedback to be effective, there is a need for\nclarity, hence dialogue is therefore not simply desirable but, arguably, essential (Brown and\nKnight, 1994). What is needed is an ability to be able to integrate the feedback process with\nan enriched learning process for the students (Collis, De Boer and Slotman, 2001).\n42\nALT-] Volume 11 Number I\nThe enhancement of the Computerized Assessment by Peers (CAP) system (Davies, 2000),\nas described in this paper, will now permit the marker and marked to consult anonymously\nconcerning the final mark or comments to be associated with an essay.\nMethods\nOne of the main issues to be addressed in this study is whether the students will make use\nof the discussion element of the CAP system, and whether it will have any perceived\nimpact upon the learning process. In past uses of the CAP system, few students have\ncontacted the tutor to complain about marks or requested further clarification. The issue\nof whether there have been benefits to the learning process due to the introduction of the\ndiscussion element of the assessment process will be difficult to quantify. It will need to be\nbased upon student feedback concerning their personal perceived benefits.\nA further pointer as to whether the students have played an active role in the discussion\nelement of the assessment process will be the number of iterations of discussion that take\nplace between the marker and marked.\nIn order to obtain student feedback on the use of the CAP system, a detailed anonymous\nquestionnaire (Appendix 1) was presented after completion of the assessment process. To\nmaintain ethical rights, the students were requested to agree or otherwise to the use of their\nquotes in the development of this study via a tick box at the end of the questionnaire.\nAssessment process\nAssessment should be another episode in learning and it can be argued that a shared\nunderstanding of the learning task and the assessment criteria are keys to this ideal.\n(Stefani, 1998)\nThe assessment reported in this paper makes use of both self- and peer-assessment of\nessays within a postgraduate class in Computer Technology at the University of\nGlamorgan during the Autumn Term, 2001. The CAP system has been used within the\nuniversity for a number of years to support the peer-assessment of student essays, and to\nprovide a core element to support the ideal of learning through assessment.\nIn order to provide a framework for the marking of the essays, guidelines were given\nsuggesting what was expected of a first-class degree, an upper second and so on. These\nguidelines were deliberately left open-ended in order to encourage student subjectivity in\nthe marking process.\nThe overall assessment process described in this study is worth 35 per cent of the total\noverall module mark, and possesses the following stages:\n1. The students are required to perform a detailed literature review in a specified area of\nComputer Technology. They are encouraged to use the Web as a source of up-to-date\ninformation.\n2. The students develop and submit an essay in RTF format via Blackboard's digital\ndrop-box facility.\n3. This essay is then self-assessed making use of the CAP system. Detailed comments\nmust be included to justify their allocated marks (Figure 1).\n43\nPhil Davies Closing the communications loop on the computerized peer-assessment of essays\n4. Having completed the self-assessment stage, the students must then peer-assess at\nleast eight of their colleagues' essays (automatically randomly selected), again making\nuse of the CAP system (Figure 1). The decision that eight essays needed to be marked\nwas decided upon in order to permit the students to view as many different attempts\n(varying from excellent to poor in both content and style), without overloading this\naspect of the assessment process.\nCOMMENTS FIELD\nNOT\nMINIMUM\nTIME\nMARKS ALLOCATED\nR m i i c h Shown (* Selection of\nReport M Come* Lovol\n\/30\n\/20\n\/20\n\/3O\n\/1OO\nJ\n'....A handheld computer that serves as an organizer for personal information which generally include * \u2014 I\nat least a name and address database, to-do Hit and note taker.

Once this marking stage is completed, the CAP's Feedback Application is used to\nview the peer comments (Figure 2). It should be noted that the students are only able\nto view the comments of their peers (not the marks). The decision not to show grades\ninitially was taken to avoid a student merely judging a marking by the grade, not the\ncomments, as the following quotes illustrate:\nsimply pay attention to the grade, and seek feedback only when it is perceived to\nprovide 'correct answers' to commit to memory (and only when their grade\nexpectation has not been met).

A marker may be of the opinion that the original mark\/comments are fair. If it is a\nquery from the owner then a reply should occur. If, however, the marker is just asked\nto re-mark, he\/she can simply click on 'Happy with Original', and an automatic email\nis generated to the owner informing them of the marker's decision.\nOn viewing the feedback on a document that the 'marker will not change', the mark is\nautomatically displayed along with the comments. If no agreement has been reached\nbetween the marker and marked, the tutor will review the marking and grades.

Because of its importance half of the total\nmarks for this assessment are allocated for this marking process.\nA process of compensation is now automatically performed by the system (Davies, 2002),\ntaking into account high and low average markings per marker. This is then used to\nproduce a compensated mean that is used as the grade for the essay. The tutor input to the\nassessment marking is thus limited to the allocation of the marks for marking.\nMarks for marking\n01062123 Compensate Self\nMark Assess 1\nSelf\nAssess 2\nOriginal Final Mark\nMark Given\ngiven\nFinal Comments Original Comments\nBaft DIFFERENCE Owner Agreed\nEmail Request History\nGood processor section.

Due to this fact, there is a significant reward to the\nstudent for performing the marking in a constructive and formative manner.\nThe CAP's 'Marks for Marking' application has been extended (Figure 5) to display the\ncommunication between the marker and marked. Marks are allocated for:\n\u2022 Consistency shown in performing the marking process (using the difference between\n47\nPhil Davies Closing the communications loop on the computerized peer-assessment of essays\nself-assessed and compensated marks as the Expected Difference Standard). This\nshould be as close to the difference per marking as is possible for each marked essay.\n\u2022 Quality of the original comments provided with respect to the level of the constructive\ninput, supported suggestions, and analytical skills shown in the subject area.\n\u2022 Quality of the marker's responses to essay owner's requests for clarification and\nremarking.\nThe overall assessment mark is then presented to the student in spreadsheet form,\nindicating where they have lost or gained marks for the essay and marking.\nResults analysis\nIn this study, 48 out of the 55 students were actively involved in the generation of auto-\nemails. At the completion of the assessment exercise, 46 out of the 55 students were\nrequested to have performed the re-marking process.\nIn total there were 244 auto-emails generated; these included requests for re-marking,\nconfirming re-marking had taken place, and also refusing to change comments.\nAfter the initial peer markings there were 440 markings in total for the 55 files. Out of\nthese, 70 per cent were agreed on the first pass of the feedback between marker and\nmarked. Having performed the re-marking process for discussion, the number agreed\nincreased to 80 per cent.\nOut of the 20 per cent of the files that remained without agreement, 8 per cent remained in\ndispute between the marker and marked, 8 per cent were left awaiting re-marking, and 4\nper cent were left not agreed due to the file owner not taking an active part in the feedback\nprocess.\nOut of the 128 requests for re-marking, 15 required a second iteration of feedback, and 3\nwent to a third iteration of feedback. In total, 75 per cent of these requests for re-marking\nproduced a decision of either agree or no change.\nOut of the re-markings that actually took place, 35 per cent of the markings had the\noriginal marks changed. This mark change ranged from +15 per cent to -28 per cent. The\naverage change being +3 per cent. There were only 8 instances where the final mark was\nmodified by 10 per cent or more. The -28 per cent change of mark showed an original\nmark of 88 per cent changed to 60 per cent. However, the comment change did not really\njustify such a significant alteration. This was noted when awarding marks for marking to\nthe marking student.\nThe average marks and standard deviations produced for the overall assessment process\nare shown below:\nSelf-assessment 69 per cent (Mean) 9.0 (Standard Deviation)\nPeer-assessment 63 per cent 8.0\nCompensated 62 per cent 7.9\nThe mean difference of 6 per cent between the self- and peer-assessment corresponds with\npast uses of this system (Davies, 2002).\n48\nALT-] Volume 11 Number I\nExamples of the types of requests that were produced by the owners of the essays to the\nmarker for the re-marking process are shown below:\nPlease clarify what you mean by . . .\nCan you suggest where I can find the information that you suggest in your comments?\nI did explain this in my essay a t . . .\nYou do not criticise or praise my work, what do you think of it?\nHow do you suggest I reference my work so you can find the source of my information?\nI'm not English, so don't criticise my grammar.\nAnalysis of student feedback\nThis study was the first use of the CAP system at postgraduate level of study. It has been\npreviously used at various levels of the undergraduate programme of study (Davies, 2000;\nDavies, 2001). The student comments produced within this study provided very similar\ngeneral feedback compared with these previous studies. The example comments provided\nbelow are taken from the student questionnaire (Appendix 1) as returned by 95 per cent of\nthe students who undertook the module's assessment process.\nConcentrating on its use in this study, over 86 per cent of the students felt that the use of\nthe assessment process had aided their learning in the module. Some of these supporting\ncomments were:\nHelps future work.\nMade me realise my self-assessment was too generous.\nA selection of comments from the many students who were positive towards the use of the\nsystem included:\nBecome more self-critical and analytical.\nHelped me enormously in being more objective about my own work.\nAnother helpful learning process.\nIt really helped me being able to do all my marking, remarking and commenting at home\nover the internet.\nOnly when I read their comments did I realize how much I had left out.\nInsight into what a lecturer looks for.\nThere were very few negative comments of any significance. The main comment of any real\nnegativity was with respect to the amount of time for the overall assessment process: 'It\nwas very time consuming.' The students reported back that on average the time taken to\nmark each essay was approximately 40 minutes. This required a considerable effort on the\nstudent's behalf, that is, 320 minutes of marking.\nWhen asked whether they had benefited from reading the comments of their peers, over 83\nper cent of the students answered in the affirmative. This should be weighed against one\n49\nPhil Davies Closing the communications loop on the computerized peer-assessment of essays\nstudent's comment: 'The best comment I received ended up as my lowest mark.' This\nvariability of views and comments has been noted in past usage of the CAP system, but the\nadded discussion offered by this system appears from the majority of student comments to\nhave made this less of a problem.\nSome general comments with respect to the feedback were:\nSome were very harsh, but needed to be for me to pay any attention.\nSome students really were very constructive.\nInitially hated the thought of doing it, but now accept that I've learnt so much from\ndoing it.\nWhen asked whether overall the students were surprised at the general standard of their\npeers' work, there was quite a number who commented upon the wide range of essays that\nhad been submitted. An example of this was: 'I could have done better when I was in\njunior school.'\nIt tended not to be the content of the essays, but the varying styles and referencing that\nbrought forth the greatest number of comments. As many as 62 per cent of the students\ncommented upon how much they' had benefited from viewing the links provided by their\npeers.\nA total of 88 per cent of the students expressed that they had found the Web to be an\nexcellent resource for providing up-to-date information in the area of computing. One\nstudent did however pose the question: 'Should we really be using the web at MSc level?'\nWith the study being aimed at more mature students than in the past, the comments\nconcerning the need for anonymity were of particular interest. Over 70 per cent of the\nstudents felt that it was essential that anonymity be maintained.\nAnonymity helped me feel more relaxed in making my judgements.\nIt would have undoubtedly reduced my capacity to be wholly objective by introducing\ninter-personal aspects.\nI might well have been intimidated when discussing comments.\nIf I'd known them I would have probably have given a higher mark.\nI would have ignored some classmates' comments due to my low opinion of them as\nindividuals.\nThis was the first use of the CAP system including the facility for discussion and re-\nmarking. When asked had they benefited from this additional process, 56 per cent of the\nstudents answered in the positive, 24 per cent in the negative, and 20 per cent undecided.\nTheir explanations on questioning made their comments much clearer.\nI identified one peer's error in marking, they apologised and corrected their comments.\nA few students suggested that they would have liked more anonymous discussion with their\nmarkers before they had decided they would not change their mark. Due to the method\nused of not showing the marks until the comments were agreed, one student complained: 'I\n50\nALT-J Volume 11 Number I\ndisagreed with him, I discussed it, he changed his comments, and I still didn't like his\nmark.'\nOne student highlighted a problem: 'They said that they'd changed their mark, but I'm not\nsure they really did it.' This was investigated by the tutor and was found to be true in the\ninstance in question. There were some very complimentary comments:\nVery good and revolutionary.\nInteresting to say the least, I actually enjoyed being assessed.\nSome students suggested that improvements could be incorporated:\nThe lecturer is seen to intervene on disagreements.\nStudents should have marks taken off for not remarking.\nThis was the case with respect to the marks for marking process, but was not spelled out to\nthe students in advance: 'better if we knew the mark before agreeing.'\nThis brings into question the students agreeing comments just because they have been\nawarded a good initial mark from a student (even though this mark could be reduced via\nthe compensation process).\nThere were two student comments that were found to be of great interest. One student gave\nhimself a mark of 88 per cent for self-assessment. Prior to the peer marking process he\nrequested that he be allowed to lower this mark to 64 per cent. When asked why, he replied:\n'It was only when I thought about how I was going to assess someone else's work did I\nrealise that I had not been critical enough in my own essay.' This was a very positive\nstatement with respect to the benefits of self- followed by peer-assessment. It highlights a\nproblem in assessment where students may be unaware of what is expected of them: 'I\nhaven't a clue what I'm assessed on' (Higgins et al, 2002). The second comment came from\ngeneral discussion with a student concerning the wide range of marks and associated\ncomments allocated by different students: 'Perhaps the range of self-assessment marks has\ngot something to do with the fact that they may have achieved their first degree overseas\nwhere marks and grades are different.'\nThis is a point to be noted particularly with respect to the use of self- and peer-assessment\nsystems, especially in the area of postgraduate study.\nConclusions\nThis study has overcome the previous problem of limited, if any, feedback via\ncomputerized peer-assessment. To placate some negative student feedback, lecturer\nintervention to mediate on markings left in conflict (8 per cent of the total markings) could\nbe introduced for future uses of the system. A further stage of acceptance of marks\nfollowing on from comment acceptance has also been suggested. However, this would\nsubstantially lengthen the time required for the assessment process.\nStatistically, the acceptability of comments in the student essays has increased by 10 per\ncent (70 per cent to 80 per cent) following the discussion process. In traditional peer-\nassessment this would not have been feasible if anonymity were to be maintained.\n51\nPhil Davies Closing the communications loop on the computerized peer-assessment of essays\nWith respect to the perceived learning benefits of utilizing the CAP system, 86 per cent of\nthe students felt that it had improved their understanding of the subject area. Over half of\nthe students (56 per cent) felt that the use of the discussion element of the system had\nproved a major positive factor in the peer-assessment process. The need for anonymity was\nconfirmed by the fact that 70 per cent of the students when questioned felt that it was\nessential to maintain anonymity for them to be able to perform the marking process in an\nobjective manner.\nPrevious negative comments concerning the lack of constructive comments by the marker\nhave been removed by the addition of the discussion aspect of the CAP system. The uptake\nof student use of this discussion facility has been mixed. Out of the 8 per cent of markings\nleft in conflict, it would have been more pleasing if more iterations of discussion had taken\nplace before the marker refused to change their comments\/marks. In future uses of the\nsystem, at least one iteration of discussion will have to be completed before the marker will\nbe allowed to refuse to change.\nWith respect to judging the effectiveness of the discussion element of the peer-assessment,\nit would have been pleasing to have seen further development in the iterative process of\nmarker\/marked questioning. Statistically this has not been the case, with only a small\nproportion (6 per cent) of the re-markings extending beyond a request-reply stage.\nConversely this could also be viewed as a positive reflection of the quality of the\ncomments, in that the need for further clarification was limited.\nThe comment that appeared consistently in the student feedback was that the marking\nprocess had facilitated greater personal reflection. It provided a means of developing the\nstudents' objectivity for future essays, and helped to develop an understanding of how to\ndirect an essay to meet the needs of the potential marker.\nOverall, the addition of discussion to the peer-assessment process has removed a number\nof past criticisms of its use as part of the formative and summative assessment process.\nThe student feedback has been extremely positive, and the perceived student benefits with\nrespect to the learning process have been noted.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks go to Mr Colin Morris (University of Glamorgan), who co-tutored this module\nand supported the use of this assessment study.\nReferences\nBhalerao, A. and Ward, A.
