Some reference is made to previous\nwriting about psychotherapeutic work with schools, and also\nto recent government policy changes which are impacting on\nservice delivery. There is discussion of the multiple levels at\nwhich interventions need to be conceptualized, and the issues\narising when working within systems and organizations that\nhave very different drivers, tasks, aims and cultures. It is\nargued that, given the complexity of the therapeutic task,\nclinicians need a high level of experience and robustness, and\nto be armed with understanding gleaned not just from\nindividual psychoanalytic psychotherapy but also from\npsychoanalytic thinking about organizations, as well as about\ntherapeutic communities, in order to function effectively.\nThere is discussion of some of the typical institutional\ndefences against anxiety and distress that arise when working\nwith the most complex children and families in schools, and in\nparticular the pressure to locate problems within individuals\nand to attempt to address such issues on an individual basis\nwhile leaving the institutional and systemic issues unad-\ndressed. I suggest that such work demands a complex view of\nthe role of the therapist, which includes taking on a role which\nhas some similarities to working in therapeutic communities.\nSome vignettes are used to illustrate how one can do effective\nand useful clinical work with individual children, and with\ntheir families when wider systemic issues are taken seriously.\nThis paper is about developing therapeutic work in schools in a complex\nclimate.

The first is the impact of the fast-changing social and\npolitical context that is posing an ever-increasing threat to the way in which\nchild mental health services can be delivered successfully. The linked theme\nraises a question about therapeutic approach and technique, and suggests that,\nalthough there is a long and helpful tradition of psychoanalytic thinking about\neducation and schools, to work effectively within a school context one needs to\nembrace ideas and philosophies from outside the traditional practice of clinic-\nbased practice, and in particular utilize ideas derived both from psycho-\nanalytically-informed organizational consultancy, but also from the thinking\nand practice of work in therapeutic communities.\nPsychoanalytically-informed work in school contexts has a long history,\nwith many helpful and seminal contributions, most of which retain salience and\nrelevance for the contemporary practitioner attempting to step out of the\nrelatively calm confines of the consulting room into the turbulent waters that\nare school life. Much of the most influential thinking has arisen from teaching\nand training several generations of practitioners working in schools (e.g.\nteachers\/mentors), who have attended courses at institutions such as the\nTavistock and who have then taken a form of applied psychoanalytic thinking\nback into such community settings. The writings of Wittenberg and Henry\n(Salzberger-Wittenberg et al. (1993) have been particularly helpful in this\nrespect. For example, such thinking has enabled professionals to be aware of the\ndangers that arise when splitting and projection are rife and are used to defend\nagainst emotional pain, or when hidden but powerful transferences develop\ntowards teachers, with the resultant hopes and pains, idealizations and\ndenigrations. These writers, as well as others such as Osborne (Dowling and\nOsborne 1985), have been at the forefront of applying psychoanalytic concepts\nto such institutional settings, making us as practitioners painfully aware of the\nhuge emotional challenges of the school environment. Many generations of\nteachers or special needs specialists have softened towards seemingly stubborn or\nrecalcitrant students when realizing the emotional reasons why their pupils\n\u2018misbehave\u2019 or struggle to concentrate or study, and that these children are not\nsimply being naughty or belligerent. Such professionals have often learnt the\nhard way about the dangers of not acknowledging the degree of dependency\npupils can develop on staff, or indeed on institutions that they can seem to\ndenigrate. Similarly helpful has been a psychoanalytic analysis of the kinds of\ndefences which can be rife in school life, such as the kinds of mania often seen\nGRAHAM MUSIC\n2\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nbefore holidays that for many pupils may in fact be dreaded, or the spirals of\nactivity and busyness through which staff tend to manage increasingly complex\nemotional challenges. Making sense of rivalry, splitting, envy and projections\nhave all contributed hugely to the understanding of professionals in schools, as\nwell as therapists working in such contexts.\nIn recent years there have also been important contributions from linked but\nrelated fields. Osborne and others have stressed the centrality of working with\nprofessional networks and systems in a thoughtful way; Dowling and Osborne\n(1985) and other colleagues from a systemic and family therapy tradition have\nhelped us to take seriously the need to engage with whole systems, with\nnetworks, and indeed maybe most importantly, with the families of the children\nwe are concerned with. Other writings (Barwick 2000) have focused on\ncounselling and other aspects of the therapeutic encounter with pupils in\nschool, and in recent years there have been some very pertinent contributions\nfrom Jackson (2002) regarding a psychoanalytically-informed form of school\nconsultation, which is becoming increasingly influential and useful, working\nwith all levels of the school hierarchy from support teachers to groups of heads,\nusing psychoanalytic understanding in staff discussion groups.\nSuch writings and thinking remain central to any attempt to understand the\nworkings of school life. However, in recent years there has been a major\nupheaval in the way children\u2019s services are being conceptualized and delivered\nwhich has in turn entailed a need to develop new ways of conceptualizing the\ntherapeutic task within schools. There has needed to be more emphasis on the\nvaried roles a clinician might play in a system which now expects therapists to\n\u2018take the clinic to the school\u2019 (Dowling and Osborne 1985), and concomitantly\nthere is more of an idea that what is needed is less \u2018expert\u2019 consultation from \u2018on\nhigh\u2019 and more working within the system, \u2018rolling one\u2019s sleeves up\u2019, seeing\nchildren and taking on cases. Thus we have to conceptualize a role that\nincludes undertaking more direct work with pupils, families and professional\nsystems, which expects clinicians to do active work with cases that are\nextremely complex, and that are often too disorganized to ever make it to a\ntraditional multidisciplinary clinic, and also a wish that clinicians should be\nsufficiently available that their status might change from the \u2018occasional visitor\u2019\nto someone who is prepared to become much more a part of day-to-day school\nlife. I think that this kind of work is best done by more experienced\npractitioners who retain clinic-based clinical time within a multidisciplinary\nteam and ongoing support from peers and senior managers; too often the least\nexperienced are sent out to do this work. The task requires a high degree of skill\nand experience, as well as a robustness and capacity to contain massive anxiety,\nto bear huge projections, to be sure enough in one\u2019s role and self to be able to\nbe very \u2018ordinary\u2019 while always retaining one\u2019s therapeutic stance. Before going\non to give examples of actual work, I will say something about the fast-changing\nexternal context.\nMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS\n3\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nTHE POLITICAL CONTEXT\nThe context in which such work now needs to be delivered has changed\ndramatically in the last few years, and this change has required a\nreconceptualization of the core tasks of the clinician within the school setting.\nServices for children in Britain are being radically re-shaped in the wake of\nvarious government initiatives and policy directives. One hopeful aspect of\nthese initiatives is that there is more understanding of the long-term and\npotentially devastating impact on society as a whole of poor mental health in\nchildren and parents, and government policy-makers have become more aware\nof the paucity of current provision and its uneven spread across the country.\nPolicy has been put in place to ensure that something is done to change this,\nwith radical plans being made to improve CAMHS.\nAlthough CAMHS has historically been delivered by NHS-trained and\nemployed practitioners (e.g. psychologists and psychiatrists), local authorities\nare increasingly leading on all Childrens\u2019 Services and the Department for\nEducation and Skills [DFES] has superseded the DOH as the prime mover in\nterms of government departments for children. The primary policy driver\ninfluencing day-to-day work in Childrens\u2019 Services is \u2018Every Child Matters\u2019\n(ECM), a hugely ambitious policy document and political project which grew\nout of the failures of safeguarding children as seen in the Climbie affair. ECM\naims to deliver a comprehensive Local Authority-led range of genuinely joined-\nup provision for children and one of the main aims include developing\nChildren\u2019s Trusts in each locality, spelling the end of separate Education and\nSocial Services departments. Maybe more importantly for child mental health\nprofessionals, CAMHS and other traditionally NHS-run children\u2019s services,\nsuch as school nursing and even midwifery and health visiting, are also being co-\nopted into these new structures in some localities. Multi-agency delivery of\nservices is a pivotal strand of these new initiatives, with local authorities being\nassessed on their ability to deliver multi-agency work into community locations.\nIn a school context this would include ensuring the setting up of well-\nfunctioning multi-agency professional forums, which might include educational\npsychologists, school nurses, CAMHS workers, connexions workers, educational\nwelfare officers and others, in order to carefully plan which service is taking\nresponsibility for the different areas of a child\u2019s care.\nThe fact that the government has placed the lead functions in the hands of\nlocal authorities needs to be taken seriously. CAMHS has traditionally been\ndelivered in the NHS by NHS-trained practitioners, but Children\u2019s Services\ngenerally are now being commissioned from budgets that the local authority\nhave the lead on, and in some places local authority commissioners are taking\nover commissioning budgets from PCTs. Suddenly the autonomy and cultural\nspecificity of NHS-based CAMHS is under threat. Yet this has occurred at the\nsame time as a massive growth of hope about the future of CAMHS. While\nmany NHS practitioners may not have heard of ECM, most in CAMHS at least\nGRAHAM MUSIC\n4\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nare more likely to be aware of another government document, the National\nService Framework (NSF) for Children, Young People and Maternity Care.\nThese documents, ECM and the children\u2019s NSF were born in separate\ngovernment departments, ECM originating from the DFES and the NSF from\nthe Department of Health (DOH). The DOH have of course published various\nNational Service Frameworks, which set the standards for care and provision,\nothers including for example one for mental health, for older people\u2019s services,\nfor renal services, for diabetes, and many more. The Children\u2019s NSF has a\nsection devoted entirely to CAMHS and sets out very clear standards for what\nshould happen in terms of CAMHS delivery in forthcoming years, and indeed is\na 10-year plan. This document was heralded as a huge triumph for CAMHS.\nThe NSF group consisted of senior, respected and experienced clinicians\nabsolutely committed to the cause of CAMHS, and the document gave huge\nconfidence that government at last was going to take this area seriously.\nAmong the central features which the NSF outlines are the expectation that\nCAMHS will expand so that what is called Comprehensive CAMHS would be\nput in place with the overall aim of improving the mental health of all children\nand young people. The NSF has supported the continuity and importance of\nCAMHS in both traditional outpatient \u2018tier 3\u2019 services and more specialist,\noften in-patient, \u2018tier 4\u2019 services. However what is radically new about the NSF\nis that it has demanded that CAMHS needs to now be delivered in \u2018tier 2\u2019\ncommunity settings, such as GP practices and schools. This work must be\ndelivered alongside other professionals through multi-agency teams, as well as\nworking alongside and offering support to first line \u2018tier 1\u2019 professionals, such as\nteachers, GPs, and others who are generally the first point of contact for\nprofessionals. The aim is for services to be available across all tiers, with a new\nand firm emphasis on accessibility of services via community settings, with early\nintervention and prevention a priority.\nThis has been an ambitious policy directive which was to be supported by a\nlarge increase in funding, and indeed spending on CAMHS nearly doubled\nbetween 2003 and 2006, although the total national spend remains small\ncompared to other areas, and NHS funding difficulties also now impact on the\ncapacity to deliver all that the NSF expects. There was, for example, to be a\nlarge increase in workforce, so that, for example there would be 15 WTEs for a\npopulation of 100 000, and this workforce would be a genuinely well-trained\nmulti-disciplinary one. This was an important and far-sighted initiative from the\ngovernment, which has led to a policy document put together by leading and\nrespected practitioners in CAMHS and has given professionals in the field high\nhopes that at last this often-neglected and \u2018cinderella\u2019 area of service delivery\nmight at last be taken seriously and make more of an impact.\nThere might be some irony in the fact that in a climate that has stressed the\nimportance of \u2018joined-up\u2019 multi-agency work the Children\u2019s NSF came out of a\ngovernment department (the DOH) which was quite separate from and possibly\nMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS\n5\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nrivalrous with the department that drew up Every Child Matters [ECM], the\nDFES, and that these fault lines are often mirrored at a local level between\nHealth, Education and Social Services. None the less there are large areas of\noverlap between the two documents, and it affords an opportunity for\nprofessionals and the local authority to forge proper joined up multi-agency\nworking partnerships.\nThese developments have opened up new opportunities to broaden and\nexpand child mental health work, to develop genuine joined-up work with other\nprofessionals, and most importantly, for children and families to access services\nthat up until now they often struggled to find their way into. Indeed\nprofessionals such as teachers often have frequently attempted referrals to child\nmental health clinics of children and families who have dire needs, yet the most\nworrying cases, those which comprise chaotic families or children with parents\nwho are unstable in other ways, often do not actually make it to the clinics\nwhere such help has traditionally been offered. The children referred in our\ndeprived inner city schools are nearly always cases of the utmost seriousness.\nOur caseloads are, for example, full of serious abuse, neglect, refugee children,\ndomestic violence, drug and alcohol use, mentally ill parents, sexualized\nbehaviour. Such complicated cases are the bread and butter of our work in\nschools, and more often than not the families of such children have been wary\nof professionals, and historically have not received a service. These are the kinds\nof cases that have traditionally been seen as so complex that they need\nmultidisciplinary work; the irony is that they are also often such complex and\ndisorganized cases that they rarely make it to clinics where multidisciplinary\nteams work, and so all too often practitioners in schools (Special Educational\nNeeds Co-ordinators [SENCOs], heads of year, mentors, etc.) are left struggling\nto \u2018hold the baby\u2019 with no specialist support.\nTHE PRACTICALITIES: BEING IN SCHOOLS\nGiven the changes already described, CAMHS practitioners have suddenly\nfound themselves working in schools in new ways, and maybe more importantly,\nhaving to take their place alongside other professionals as part of multi-agency\nteams, and spending large amounts of time in a particular school. This kind of\nwork requires a different mind-set and set of skills to that previously used by the\nexperienced clinicians who would come into schools to briefly \u2018consult\u2019 about\nspecific cases, or to offer some form of support or supervision. These new\nexpectations have meant adapting to new cultures and a whole new set of\nassumptions. This work takes place at an intersection where NHS and education\ncultures meet, and we have found that often we are strangers, if not foreigners,\nto each other, speaking different languages, having different aims, tasks,\npreoccupations, expectations, understandings, and having to slowly and\ncarefully learn from each other and give up some of our cherished shibboleths\nGRAHAM MUSIC\n6\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nin order to be effective in our work and useful to each other. For those of us\ntrained in mental health, schools can seem to be genuinely alien cultures, and\nclinicians trained to work in more traditional therapeutic settings, such as\noutpatient clinics, have to work hard to adjust to the harsh realities of working\nmuch more \u2018at the coalface\u2019, without the protections that our normal clinics\nafford us.\nWilfred Bion (1961) was said to have once famously suggested that \u2018if there\naren\u2019t two anxious people in the room, the two being both the therapist and the\npatient, then there was not much point in turning up to find out what you\nalready know\u2019. Schools can be extraordinarily anxiety-provoking places and I\nthink that in relation to delivering therapeutic work in schools Bion need have\nno fear about there being insufficient anxiety. The question he and we might\nask though is who is the patient that is anxious, and what is, and should, the\ntherapist be anxious about. Schools are complex institutions attempting an array\nof difficult tasks in a fast-changing world; government policies and targets mean\nconstant pressures on headteachers, on class teachers, on pastoral support\nsystems, pressures to attract the \u2018right\u2019 pupils, to control bad behaviour, to do\nwell in tests, to limit exclusions of pupils, to name but a few. Given this context,\ncareful thought needs to be given to the role of the psychotherapist or mental\nhealth worker who is transplanted into an educational context, and in particular\nin the deprived inner city schools where we are being asked to ply our trade.\nWho the client actually is can be a moveable feast; at times it is simply a\nreferred child, but often it will be the staff member who referred the child in a fit\nof anxiety, or the parents of the child, or an external social services system in\nsome disarray, or the institutional culture or management structure of the school\nas a whole. The CAMHS practitioner often finds themselves adopting a subtle\nand careful position, never quite sure when one is off or on duty, nor where\nexactly to locate and deliver one\u2019s interventions. Rather like Dilys Daws\u2019 (1985)\nclassic contributions about providing infant mental health input in GP practices\nby \u2018standing beside the weighing scales\u2019, one adopts an uneasy and complex\nposition of being both inside and outside an institution; one\u2019s trips to staffrooms\nor along corridors can be for the purposes of being social, taking respite,\nproviding consultation, feeding back about patients and much more. Echoing\nwork in therapeutic communities, one is never fully off duty, and sometimes the\nmost crucial and helpful work takes place in idle moments by the kettle in the\nstaffroom, or in the car park. School life does not work in the way we \u2018tightly\nframed\u2019 psychoanalytic clinicians are trained to expect, and as much as we try to\nassert clear boundaries, we find that in order to be useful, we necessarily become\na little uncomfortable as we take our place in the me\u02c6le\u00b4e of school life, hopefully\nwith one foot inside and another firmly in our own secure bases of clinical\nexperience, psychoanalytic traditions and professional support structures.\nAs an example, we might briefly compare this kind of work to that which\ntakes place in a clinic and witness how \u2018exposed to the elements\u2019 therapists in\nMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS\n7\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nschools can be. For example, in clinics most clinicians receive referrals only\nafter they have been carefully filtered, generally scrutinized by a committee of\nsenior practitioners who have the time to ask careful questions or seek more\ninformation from referrers. In schools, referrals are almost always in person,\noften a desperate reaction to an anxiety-provoking event, and just as often\nschools demand immediate action, to the extent that we can find ourselves\naccosted in corridors and on our mobile phones. In clinics when a referral is not\naccepted, the clinician is shielded and does not bear the flak and\ndisappointment one receives in schools for daring to suggest a referral might\nnot be appropriate. One is working without the support of a multidisciplinary\nteam of colleagues, often as a lone practitioner, in a setting where one is rarely\nconsulted, where things change from moment-to-moment, where you are not\ntold that a child you were due to see is on a school trip, or even excluded from\nschool. Rather than the relative luxury of bespoke therapy rooms in clinics, with\nreceptionists welcoming patients, in school settings the work is often done in\nunsatisfactory rooms, often inconsistently available, often with sessions\ninterrupted by teachers, and the work sometimes depends on the therapist\npersonally calling a child out of the classroom and bringing them to the room.\nTo add to our anxieties, our referrer is of course present before, during and after\na session, scrutinizing and expecting \u2018results\u2019. School staff are sometimes\nambivalent about therapeutic work, on occasions stating explicitly that they\nwant our help, while simultaneously subtly undermining the work, distrustful of\nthinking which smacks of the psychological. Teachers and school staff also often\nhave a fantasy that we can and should take away the most complicated and\ndisturbed children and then simply, and very quickly, bring them back \u2018cured\u2019.\nThese teachers, struggling with children from the most deprived backgrounds,\noften feel at the end of their tether and as if they are failing. They can end up\nfeeling de-skilled, overwhelmed and useless, particularly by severely acting out\nchildren who get under their skins. Consequently our arrival in schools too\noften heralds great hopes, we can be placed on a pedestal and then when we fail\nto cure these children immediately we can come crashing down from our\npedestal with a nasty bump, often the bearer of massive projections, projections\nit is a relief for them to pile onto us, as we now become the ones who have\nfailed, or who are not much use.\nWHO IS THE PATIENT ANYWAY?\nFor the therapist trained primarily to work one-to-one in a clinic consulting\nroom, the shock of exposure to the diversity of demands, expectations and\nprojections that one encounters in work in schools can be overwhelming.\nOne particular danger that too often hampers therapeutic work in schools is\nthe idea that problems somehow reside in individual children and should be\ndealt with there. There can at times be too neat a match between the training of\nGRAHAM MUSIC\n8\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\na psychoanalytic psychotherapist to work one-to-one with individuals, and a\ncommon idea in schools that it is indeed within individuals that such problems\narise. In schools, staffs are primarily trained to teach and each child is seen as an\nindividual, but sometimes their context is forgotten. If a child is not learning,\nthen the child is seen as having a problem, perhaps a learning difficulty,\nsomething internal to the child. If a child misbehaves, or is unhappy, or\naggressive, then similarly the conventional understanding of this is that the\nchild has a problem, the child needs help as the problem is \u2018in the child\u2019; one\nshould apply a dose of something, maybe detention, maybe help with anger\nmanagement, maybe even therapy. This convenient but overly individualistic\nanalysis can lead children too often to be sent for individual help such as\ncounselling in schools, with the hope that the counsellor or therapist will \u2018sort\nthem out\u2019. Yet with such complex cases the work needs to be aimed at several\nlevels of the system simultaneously. Often the most useful intervention is to\nwork with the teachers, helping them to make sense of a child\u2019s behaviours; we\nalways involve the parents as part of the treatment, something schools often\nfind hard to stomach, sometimes retorting \u2018you are here to help the children, not\nthe parents\u2019. We insist on meeting with other professionals, such as social\nworkers, educational psychologists or psychiatrists. If direct work takes place\nwith a child or family then we always give feedback to teachers and get them to\nshare information with us. This approach is a big challenge to schools where\neveryone is frantically busy, where they just want to \u2018get on\u2019 and teach, and we\nshould, in their minds, just sort out these children for them.\nOften what looks like an emotional or behavioural issue might in fact have\nits roots in something systemic. As a simple example, in one school with two\nparallel classes for children of the same age, several children were flagged up as\nneeding therapy in one class, and yet none were referred in the parallel class. On\nthe surface these referrals seemed appropriate; the referred children were\nevidencing signs of disturbance and were clearly struggling in many aspects of\ntheir lives and we wondered whether the first teacher had had an unlucky\nintake. Yet when a therapist observed the two classes in action we were struck\nby the contrast between the very well boundaried and experienced teacher in\nthe class where no children had been referred, as opposed to the rather\ninexperienced teacher struggling to impose her personality on the other class\nwith the so-called difficult children. Maybe the experienced teacher was more\n\u2018out of touch\u2019 with the emotional worlds of her children, maybe she deflected\nher anxiety or was slightly thick-skinned; however, we felt that therapy for the\nreferred children would not be the answer to what really was a matter of both\nteaching technique and gaining support in managing the huge anxiety that\nworking with such children gives rise to.\nIndeed providing spaces for school staff to think about the arduous nature of\nthe work, and to gain a more in-depth understanding of the emotional life of the\nchildren can have a huge impact on a school\u2019s culture and way of responding to\nMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS\n9\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nserious emotional and psychological issues, and this has been written about\neloquently elsewhere by Jackson (2002). For example, in the same school I set\nup a support group for learning support staff, staff who often have to manage\nbeing dumped with the most worrying children, but have the least training and\nlowest pay and status. I encouraged them to talk about the children they worked\nwith, what being with these children might stir up in them, and the kind of\nissues that arise in their practice. One child, Torvil, was flagged up as a worry,\nand described by several assistants as a \u2018spoilt brat\u2019 and \u2018annoying\u2019, and indeed\ndisdain and despair were the primary emotions expressed. We soon realized that\nthe assistant formally assigned to Torvil knew little or nothing about his\nbackground, and it became apparent that the teaching staff tend to keep such\ninformation to themselves. Other assistants in the group were glad to share the\nbits of information they had about Torvil, and with each nugget of information\na new and different picture emerged and one could see their view of him\nsoftening. We learnt that he had been placed on the child protection register for\nneglect by Social Services, and was living with his mother at his grandparents\u2019\nhome, and that his grandmother had been awarded parental responsibility. It\nsoon became clear to me that in such institutions the support teachers can feel\nrather like the children they care for; they are often told what to do with no\nwarning, teachers do not share educational or behavioural plans with them, they\nmight not be warned if there is an outing and a child is not there. This soon led\nto another intervention outside the group, speaking to the school management\nto facilitate class teachers and pastoral support staff to both share information\nand understanding about the children, and to jointly plan the work. Meanwhile\nthe group members began to eagerly digest ideas about how deprived children\nsuch as Torvil see the adult world, how little they feel \u2018held in mind\u2019, how they\nmight develop particular defences against overwhelming emotional experiences,\nand how they communicate their feelings in ways that can make workers like\nthemselves feel inadequate and angry.\nAfter one such group, with Torvil on my mind, I went to observe the\n\u2018nurture group\u2019 of which Torvil is a member. Utilizing an applied version of the\nobservational methods developed by Bick (1968) and others can provide\nextremely useful insight into the functioning of a child, a class or indeed a whole\nschool. In this instance I saw an impressive episode of teaching and emotional\ncontainment from an attuned teacher, Molly. Torvil himself struck me as a very\nfragile, open-faced boy, rather desperate for attention. Towards the end of the\nclass Molly had the whole group sitting quietly on the floor as she talked about a\nforthcoming outing. Molly described the forthcoming outing, counting down\nthe days, and she showed the kind of forethought we rarely see in school staff.\nThe children looked excited, and Molly then said that everyone will have to be\non time for the trip, and at this two children shift in their seats uncomfortably,\none being Torvil. Molly said \u2018what\u2019s wrong?\u2019 and the girl and Torvil between\nthem explained that they never get to school on time. Molly replied that the\nGRAHAM MUSIC\n10\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\ngrown-ups would make sure it happens this time, and they relaxed. She then\nsaid that all the children will have packed lunches and at this the same two\nshuffle around, and Torvil, looking somewhat shamefaced, said \u2018I really scared, I\nmight not get a lunch\u2019.\nThe depiction of Torvil as a \u2018spoilt brat\u2019 was fast losing its descriptive power\nin the face of this obvious deprivation and I was glad to hear soon after this that\nhe was being referred to CAMHS. He had been aggressive, and more\nworryingly, he had shown extremely sexualized behaviour in school, and\namongst other concerns, this mixed-race boy had a grandmother, the mother of\nhis white mother, who said that the difficult behaviour is \u2018the black in him\u2019.\nThere were many ways to proceed here. We observed him in other settings, and\nthis more in-depth and fine-grained observation not surprisingly revealed an\nextremely vulnerable boy who was struggling to manage both socially and\nacademically. We met the class teacher and fed back our observations which\nwere felt to be helpful, not least in thinking about how to help Torvil feel more\npositively held in mind. Such cases require interventions at several levels; as\ndescribed, there was the teaching and support staff to think about, there was\nTorvil\u2019s own need to speak to someone, but more importantly we needed to\ngather together the relevant external professionals, such as the social worker,\neducational psychologist, the worker from the mother\u2019s rehabilitation\nprogramme, and we then worked to engage with the grandmother and mother.\nIt was only after a lot of careful preliminary work that we could say the\ntherapeutic work specifically for Torvil had begun, but as so often in these cases,\nwe hope that some of the thinking and containment provided by other aspects\nof the work (e.g. work discussion groups, observations, feedback to staff) would\nhave rubbed off on other aspects of the school system.\nDIRECT CINICAL WORK \u2013 AN EXAMPLE OF APPLIED WORK\nAs already stated, this work requires a range of skills and aptitudes over and\nabove the difficult enough task of ordinary clinical work with children or\nparents. Our thinking has increasingly been informed by psychoanalytic ideas\nabout institutions (Menzies-Lyth 1992, Obholzer and Roberts 1994), as well as\nthinking derived from work within therapeutic communities (Hinshelwood\n1987, Cooper et al. 1989, Gordon and Mayo 2004). This thinking allows\nclinicians to make sense, often retrospectively, of the complex range of\ninstitutional dynamics and projective pressures that fly around settings such as\nschools, and which we all become prey to. I would like to stress a particular\naspect of thinking derived from the therapeutic community movement, which I\nthink is particularly apt when working in schools, the thinking which\nhighlighted mechanisms whereby particular subjects, whether children, or staff,\nor indeed therapists, can be cast in roles as somehow \u2018wrong\u2019 or not fitting with\nthe dominant culture, and so seen as part of an \u2018out-group\u2019, as somehow \u2018bad\u2019, as\nMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS\n11\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\n\u2018beyond the pale\u2019 and needing to be \u2018got rid of\u2019, rather similar to the fate of the\n\u2018mad\u2019 (Foucault 1971) or insane (Laing 1982). Children like Torvil are often\nplaced in such roles, as \u2018naughty\u2019, \u2018uncontrollable\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019, yet they also suffer from\na profound sense of \u2018unease\u2019, of not being \u2018at home\u2019 in the institution, in society\nor in themselves. Projective mechanisms ensure that the behavioural sequelae of\npsychic pain, alienation, and the incapacity to make sense of overwhelming\nexperience, too often gets translated into a moral or educational language, of\nchildren who are not being able to concentrate, are being \u2018contrary\u2019, have\nADHD or conduct disorder, need discipline and much else. An idea that these\nchildren \u2018do not fit\u2019 often leads to literal and moral exclusion. On top of such\nexclusion by others, such children often seem not to \u2018feel comfortable in the\ninstitutions but also in their own skins\u2019, rather like Winnicott wrote of patients\nwhose psyches do not \u2018indwell\u2019 in their soma, or Heidegger\u2019s (1971) statement\nthat \u2018the real plight of dwelling does not merely lie in lack of houses\u2019. Again,\nlike in work with therapeutic communities, one aims for a safe external and\nthen internal \u2018dwelling place\u2019 to combat the sense of being \u2018disarticulated from\npersonal belonging\u2019 (Cooper et al. 1989: 37). Such a sense of alienation from\ntheir environment, which can be exacerbated as rejections at home and\nelsewhere are repeated in schools, can be ameliorated through work with the\ncomplex systems and structures around children, as well as in individual\ntherapeutic work. The nurture group run by Molly described above might be\nseen as equivalent to the safety of the therapeutic milieu, and the complicated\ntask so often is to extend that safety into the setting as a whole, by doing\nongoing complex and subtle work with teachers and other staff.\nI will now give a brief example of some work undertaken in the early days of\nthe projects I was involved in, one that provided a steep learning curve. In this\nparticular school, as often, the arrival of a therapeutic project was swiftly\nfollowed by the referral of several children to the service for individual therapy.\nIt can be hard to withstand the pressure to rush into individual work, although\nthis runs all manner of risks such as colluding with the dominant idea in schools,\nthat the problems reside in children, and a difficulty many schools have in\nthinking about how the child\u2019s issues might be related to what is happening at\nhome and in the surrounding systems\nIn this school we found that we were being asked to see a lot of acting out\nchildren, mostly boys, who were at risk of exclusion. All the referred children\nhad already had temporary exclusions, school staff were often at their wits end\nabout them, and we began to notice a culture develop whereby a child was\nflagged up not just as having a problem but as being \u2018the\u2019 problem in a school.\nThe fantasy in the school was that if only this child was excluded then\neverything in the institution would improve and life would proceed smoothly.\nThe inadequacy many staff felt when confronted with real behavioural problems\nin children often led to a rather desperate need to lay the blame somewhere.\nNot surprisingly the pattern was that as soon as they excluded a child designated\nGRAHAM MUSIC\n12\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nas the threat to the school, then another potential scapegoat popped up in his or\nher place. One of these children referred to us was permanently excluded quite\nquickly. With the next we changed tack, and became much more actively\ninvolved with the parents, the network, and the school system. This child did\nwell, and we held him in school until transfer to secondary school. The next\ncase, whom we will call Courtney, also became the focus of the anxiety of the\nwhole school, and the individual therapeutic work described below was\nundertaken by Becky Hall, and I am grateful to her for allowing me to use this\nmaterial.\nCourtney, a 7-year-old girl, was referred as she was having tantrums and\noften cried for her mother during the day. She was described as a volatile child,\nunable to cope with transitions; she was struggling academically and\noccasionally hit out at other children in the class. She was often sent to school\nin \u2018unsuitable\u2019 clothes \u2013 tight jeans, cropped tops \u2013 and there was some\nsuggestion of sexually precocious behaviour. Social Services became involved\nfollowing her father\u2019s recent release from prison. His sentence followed an\nevent, precipitated by depression, in which he had put his own life, and that of\nhis family, at risk.\nThe family lived on a notorious local estate with Courtney\u2019s two teenage\ncousins for whom they had parental responsibility. The family was well-known\nto, and suspicious of, local services and their lifestyle was marked by chaos and\ndisorder, including several bereavements of a violent and tragic nature, losses\nthat remained extremely vivid to Courtney and her mother. In meetings Mother\ntalked ceaselessly, Father anxiously paced around, it was difficult to bring\nmeetings to a close, and the impression was of an extremely chaotic household\nwith few boundaries, no privacy and little protection for children from adult life.\nCourtney attended an after-school club daily and was then left to play out,\nunsupervised, on the estate. In contrast to the school\u2019s picture of Courtney as a\nrather sexually precocious adolescent, the therapist perceived a desperate,\ngreedy baby-like child and a demanding toddler. She refused to go to bed,\ndemanded baths at midnight, helped herself to food at all hours and was put to\nsleep at night in her parents\u2019 bed with a bottle.\nThe parents too were extremely needy and the initial intervention included\noffering them regular support for themselves, to help with understanding\nCourtney, and also to help mend the link between the family and the school.\nTherapy began later, by which time the situation in school had begun to\ndeteriorate. Her behaviour was increasingly violent as she \u2018attacked\u2019 staff and\n\u2018trashed\u2019 rooms. She was frequently excluded and the staffroom was bursting with\nstories about her. Our image of a sad, confused, desperate if angry little girl was\neclipsed by the staff\u2019s view of someone monstrous, unlikeable and uncontrollable;\nthe fact that she was a 7-year-old child seemed to have been forgotten.\nIndividual work began in which she stripped the dolls of their clothes with\nher teeth, climbed on the furniture, poured water on the floor, and begged for\nMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS\n13\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nnew toys, making the therapist feel as if she was cruelly withholding things from\nher. Courtney\u2019s inability to say hello or goodbye gave some indication of the\npowerful constellation of feelings aroused for her by separations and re-unions.\nPatient-centred comments such as \u2018I wonder if you\u2019re feeling\u2026\u2019 had to be\nquickly retracted when it became clear that Courtney could not tolerate feeling\nvulnerable; she would scream at her therapist, threaten her with chairs, and rush\nto the toilet. Talking in the third person (\u2018There seems to be a Big Courtney\nhere who wants to look after everything herself, and a Little Courtney who\u2019s a\nbit worried about everything she\u2019s got to manage\u2019), and analyst-centred\ncomments worked better. Yet still as breaks loomed Courtney would run from\nthe room into the playground or cower behind dustbins screaming.\nShe stepped easily into the role vacated by the boy who was now doing much\nbetter, that of being \u2018the\u2019 problem for the school, having what Bion (1961) called\na natural \u2018valency\u2019 for this role for which she was a perfect candidate. She was used\nto being unwanted and rejected, had little experience of structure or boundaries,\nwas easily upset and overwhelmed, had little capacity to regulate her own\nemotions and made little sense of the hopes and expectations of the professionals\naround her who had \u2018her best interests\u2019 at heart.\nFollowing one break, which coincided with a trusted staff member leaving,\nCourtney regularly ran out of class and off the school premises, and, as is typical\nwith such children, she particularly did not manage unstructured times. She\ncomplained of illness, begged to go home, hit out at fellow pupils and \u2018attacked\u2019\nstaff who tried to restrain her, and she was excluded several times. Irrespective\nof what she was enacting for the institution, we knew that we had to intervene\nvery actively to avoid a more permanent exclusion. Her parents continued to be\nmet regularly, and in addition to meetings with the Special Educational Needs\nCo-ordinator (SENCO), we liaised weekly with Courtney\u2019s teacher and with\nthe support staff within and outside the school, in the hope that we could help\nthe system manage and make sense of what was happening. Courtney found it\ndifficult to come to her sessions, and once there, would express her intolerance\nof painful feelings of any kind by running out of the room. Collecting a resistant\nCourtney from the classroom was almost a ritual public humiliation for the\ntherapist, as Courtney prevaricated and delayed. In the therapist\u2019s words\nI tried hard to think about the break and its impact on her. I struggled to\nkeep hold of the idea that Courtney, a child rejected from everywhere,\nmight need to project some of this experience into me. I crossed the\nfoyer passing a support teacher who rolled her eyes at me and tutted.\nThe senior management of the school seemed to experience Courtney\u2019s\nbehaviour as an attack, and they responded punitively. She seemed to have\nbecome a receptacle for the negative feelings of the institution as a whole. Our\nview that she was a very worried little girl seemed to be completely at odds with\nthe terrifying version of her in the staff\u2019s mind.\nGRAHAM MUSIC\n14\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nThe relationship between the school and Courtney\u2019s parents began to break\ndown rapidly under the imminent threat of a permanent exclusion. Mother and\nFather felt that Courtney had been abandoned by the school and, in turn,\nseemed to feel abandoned themselves, and they stopped coming to their\nsessions. A common form of splitting in this work is between schools and\nparents; staff can blame parents in an effort to feel less bad themselves, and\nparents get angry with the school for not supporting them and their child. As\ntherapists we suffered another level of projection, becoming identified with\nCourtney as the problem, and our attempts to feed-back to staff felt increasingly\nfrustrated, and her sessions were regularly interrupted. Teachers who are doing\ntheir utmost to help the children in their care struggle when these children\nthrow their best efforts back in their faces; they feel rejected, de-skilled, hurt,\nand often respond punitively, like a mother whose carefully prepared food is spat\nout or rejected. Children like Courtney are easy to give up on, and when staff\ncannot hold onto the idea that a child is being helped to have the future that\nsociety believes it should have, then the hopelessness and upset can be\nexacerbated, leaving staff wanting to blame, punish, exclude, do anything to\ngain temporary relief and respite. Courtney and similar children might be\ncompared to psychiatric patients in the way the system labels and rejects them.\nGordon stated about the insane \u2018It is social sanitisation. The unsanitary become\nthe insane and the issue becomes one of disposal\u2019 (Gordon and Mayo 2004: 10),\nand if one translates bad for mad, and unmanageable for insane, then these\nchildren are indeed faced with a similar form of social ostracism, what schools\nused to call \u2018expulsion\u2019 and is now called \u2018being excluded\u2019, or even the more\nrecent neologism \u2018secluded\u2019.\nIn the light of the growing sense of crisis we called a network meeting that\nwas attended by her parents, the family social worker, the headteacher, a\nmember of the schools reading recovery programme, a member of the local\nauthority inclusion service, the parent\u2019s therapist and our service. This felt like a\npivotal moment and provided a space in which to think about the emotional\ncomplexity of the case. The impact was almost immediate, school staff began to\nview Courtney differently, she managed a full week in school, her parents\nattended their sessions again and the school invited us to contribute to their\napplication for a statement of special educational needs. We were pulling\ntogether rather than blaming each other.\nShe gradually began to build up a growing trust and confidence in the\ntherapy. This extract illustrates something of her difficulties and developments\nat this time. It seems to reflect her growing capacity to acknowledge separations\nand the mechanisms she used to defend against the more painful feelings they\nstirred up.\n\u2018Pretend this is my babe\u2019, said Courtney, holding up one of the dolls,\n\u2018And she has to go to hospital for three weeks\u2019. \u2018Goodness\u2019, I replied,\n\u2018Three weeks, that does seem like a long time\u2019.

Courtney hurled the\ndoll across the room, \u2018Pretend you\u2019re my servant\u2019, she barked, \u2018Clear up\nthis mess!\u2019.\nShe even seemed to have been able to hold onto some of the good, trusting\nfeelings about the therapy following the summer break and to have internalized\nsomething. The work with her parents picked up, and she settled well with\nintensive, regular classroom support, and in her therapy we saw a growing ability\nto tolerate some of the painful feelings stirred up around separations \u2013 where she\nonce bolted from the room, or screamed at her therapist to \u2018Shut up!\u2019, she said\n\u2018Ssh, I know, it\u2019s half term\u2019. She became able to say \u2018Hello\u2019 and sometimes even\n\u2018goodbye\u2019. Her teacher commented on her acquisition of an emotional language\nand her parents joked that she now \u2018counselled\u2019 them at home. She expected to\nbe thought about, and there was an increasing sense that the chaos of the\noutside world intruded less dramatically into the therapy.\nIndividual work was having an impact, but only when the adult network was\nheld. Inevitably crises continually arose, and when the system around the family\nbecame in any way fragile then the previous concerns re-emerged strongly; for\nexample, when staff left, or dad began to drink again, then her behaviour\nescalated, staff anxiety increased and words like \u2018exclusion\u2019 again began to be\nmentioned. Continuing to have a vigilant eye on the network, and on issues\naround the children, meant that we could deter such dramatic enactments. This\nrequired a lot of work with staff, to move nearer to what Tom Main (1977: 11)\ndescribed, again in relation to therapeutic communities, as \u2018an atmosphere of\nrespect for all, and the examination of difficulties \u2026 in a culture which is\nconcerned with whole people\u2019. This is a worthy goal to aim for, but maybe a\nmore realistic aim is simply to be able to take a few tiny steps in that direction,\nwhich did happen with this case at various levels of the system.\nCONCLUSIONS\nObholzer and Roberts (1994) have argued that our major national institutions\noften serve as a location for all manner of projections, hopes and expectations\nfor the population. He writes that the NHS might be burdened with a role in\nrelation to our fear of death, being seen as a \u2018keeping-death-at bay\u2019 service,\nwhile educational institutions carry the hope that our children will be equipped\nand skilled to live in the society of the future, and maybe mental health services\nbear other projected hopes, such as stopping us or our children from going mad.\nCAMHS, suddenly part of a broader agenda for Children\u2019s Services, is expected\nto provide help to community settings like schools alongside other professionals\nin a new multi-agency context. Similarly schools are being asked to play roles\nGRAHAM MUSIC\n16\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nwhich are new to them, such as being a site for the delivery of a whole range of\nother services, and this gives rise to a new weight of expectation. As social\nunrest, drug use, violence and crime increases, and as social services retreat\nincreasingly to a more statutory role, schools are being asked to play a role in\nmanaging social breakdown, while bearing the hopes and responsibilities for the\nfuture of our children, and for society as a whole.\nOne of the dangers is that the educational system is massively projected\ninto, by the general population, by parents, and possibly not least, by\ngovernment. Research by many epidemiologists such as Wilkinson (2005)\nhave consistently demonstrated that both physical and mental health declines\nin populations in direct proportion to the increase in inequality between the\ntop and bottom layers of society, and that this gives rise to more social unrest,\nviolence, more stress-related illness, and shorter life expectancy. Other recent\nresearch such as that commissioned by the Nuffield Foundation (Collishaw\net al. 2004) has shown that adolescent mental health in this country has\ndeteriorated much more than in other countries in Western Europe, and\nindeed only in America has there been a comparable deterioration. Schools\nare increasingly faced on a daily basis with the repercussions of this, with\ngangs and violence, with poor mental health in children and families, and\neven more so in the deprived inner city schools where we work. The idea in\ngovernment and elsewhere that either different schools or better parenting\nshould somehow be responsible for alleviating these social issues is maybe a\nprojection too far for schools, parents and mental health workers. There is a\ndanger that schools, parents, and particular children will bear the criticism for\nsocial failures.\nTherapeutic work can of course help in specific cases when the\ninterventions are aimed at several layers of the system as well as the individual\nchild, as in Courtney\u2019s case. In the cases described work took place with\nchildren, class teacher, the SENCO, the support staff, the parents, the social\nworker and other external agencies, and where possible, the head. The most\neffective interventions include working with the overall culture of the school,\nand individual work is only part of a package; slightly changing the words of\nTom Main (1980: 53) \u2018a community (school) may become therapeutic as a social\norganisation no matter what individual treatments are offered\u2019. Schools show\nvariable capacities to function as effective \u2018containers\u2019 of both feelings and\nattributes that can otherwise be disowned, split off and projected into others. It\nis clear that when the anxieties could be managed, when staff have a space to\nreflect on what is being stirred up, and people feel better about their work, then\nthe culture of blaming and mutual projection can abate.\nThe kind of children and issues that one is confronted with in schools, such\nas in the example of Courtney, can too easily lead to feelings of inadequacy and\nhelplessness, which in turn can lead to splitting and projection. Teachers can\nblame parents, parents feel the schools are failing their children, social services\nMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS\n17\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n14\n:3\n2 \n11\n M\nay\n 2\n01\n0\nare seen as letting vulnerable children down, heads blame local authorities for\nforcing schools to keep unmanageable children in schools, local education\nauthorities blame schools for not managing children well, and as we as therapists\ncome on the scene there is always the danger that we join in this projective\nmerry-go-round, becoming simply the new blamed or joining in the blaming.\nWe approach this work with both a belief in its usefulness and effectiveness, but\nalso wary of the dangers of omniscience and omnipotence; neither schools nor\ntherapists can ultimately compensate for society\u2019s failures, but some of these\nnewer government expectations of delivering services into schools can still\nmake a difference to the lives of particular children, families, staff and hopefully,\nschools as a whole.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author would like to thank Marta Cioeta, Marina Bonfatto and particularly Becky\nHall for their unstinting input into this case.\nREFERENCES\nBarwick, N.
