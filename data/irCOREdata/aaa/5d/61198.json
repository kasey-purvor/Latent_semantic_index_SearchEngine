An optimal estimation method for simultane-\nously determining both basal slipperiness and basal topog-\nraphy from variations in surface flow velocity and topogra-\nphy along a flow line on ice streams and ice sheets is pre-\nsented. We use Bayesian inference to update prior statistical\nestimates for basal topography and slipperiness using sur-\nface measurements along a flow line. Our main focus here\nis on how errors and spacing of surface data affect estimates\nof basal quantities and on possibly aliasing\/mixing between\nbasal slipperiness and basal topography. We find that the ef-\nfects of spatial variations in basal topography and basal slip-\nperiness on surface data can be accurately separated from\neach other, and mixing in retrieval does not pose a serious\nproblem. For realistic surface data errors and density, small-\namplitude perturbations in basal slipperiness can only be re-\nsolved for wavelengths larger than about 50 times the mean\nice thickness. Bedrock topography is well resolved down to\nhorizontal scale equal to about one ice thickness. Estimates\nof basal slipperiness are not significantly improved by accu-\nrate prior estimates of basal topography. However, retrieval\nof basal slipperiness is found to be highly sensitive to un-\nmodelled errors in basal topography.\n1 Introduction\nIndirect inference of basal shear stress distributions of ice\nstreams from measurements of surface data has been used\nsuccessfully in the past to study the role of basal conditions\nin controlling the flow of ice streams (MacAyeal, 1992, 1993;\nMacAyeal et al., 1995; Vieli and Payne, 2003; Joughin et al.,\nCorrespondence to:\nG. H. Gudmundsson\n(ghg@bas.ac.uk)\n2004, 2006). Simultaneous retrieval of both basal topogra-\nphy and basal lubrication was done by Thorsteinsson et al.\n(2002), and a Bayesian framework for surface-to-bed inver-\nsion was outlined by Gudmundsson (2004). To date, limited\nattention has been paid to some more general aspects of sur-\nface inversion on glaciers. For example it remains unclear\nhow the accuracy of estimates of basal quantities is affected\nby the spatial distribution of surface measurements and mea-\nsurement errors. Possible mixing effects, such as the effects\nof basal topography on retrieved slipperiness distributions\nhave also not received much attention.\nThe aim of this paper is to clarify the effects of data den-\nsity and data quality on indirect estimates of basal topogra-\nphy and basal slipperiness on ice streams. We do this by con-\nsidering three different aspects of the retrieval, 1) errors due\nto mixing between basal topography and basal slipperiness\nin retrieval and mixing between different frequency compo-\nnents (mixing errors), 2) the spatial and frequency resolution\nof the retrieval, and 3) the number of resolved basal quanti-\nties per measurement site at the surface.\nWe use a Bayesian approach to this inverse problem and\ndetermine the bedrock profile (b(x)) and the spatial slip-\nperiness distribution (c(x)) which maximise the conditional\nprobability P(b, c|s, u,w), where s(x), u(x), and w(x) are\nthe surface topography, and the horizontal and vertical sur-\nface velocity component, respectively. The forward model\nis based on perturbation solutions to the full Stokes system\n(Gudmundsson, 2003). Consequently our results are only\nstrictly valid in the limiting case of linearised flow pertur-\nbations. Numerical estimates of the strengths of non-linear\neffects in the forward model can be found in Raymond and\nGudmundsson (2005).\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n168 G. H. Gudmundsson and M. Raymond: Surface inversion on ice streams\nThe method used here differs in a number of aspects from\nprevious work done by other authors on the surface-to-bed\ninversion problem on glaciers and ice sheets. We formally\nintroduce prior information about basal properties and use\nthe surface measurements in combination with the prior in-\nformation to give an updated estimate of basal properties.\nThis new estimate of basal properties is given in terms of a\nGaussian probability density function defined through a max-\nimum a posteriori (MAP) solution and its covariance. In the\nsense that the solution maximises the conditional probability\nP(b, c|s, u,w), it can be regarded as an optimal estimate of\nbasal properties. A further example for optimal estimation in\nice sheet modelling can be found in (Arthern and Hindmarsh,\n2003).\nAlthough not always stated explicitly, some sort of a priori\nexpectation about \u201csensible\u201d basal properties has been used\nin most, if not all, previous work. For example the particular\nminimising norm used by Truffer (2004) reflects the reason-\nable expectation that basal properties are in some ways spa-\ntially correlated and that surface data can only be expected to\ngive information about basal properties over restricted set of\nspatial scales.\nAs pointed out by (MacAyeal et al., 1995), for most inverse\nproblems direct minimisation of the misfit between measured\nand modelled data does not always lead to a satisfactory so-\nlution. In the control method introduced by MacAyeal (1993)\nand used by number of other authors (e.g., Vieli and Payne,\n2003; Joughin et al., 2004; Larour et al., 2005), this prob-\nlem is avoided by starting with an initial guess judged to be\nreasonable by the modeller and by not fully minimising the\nmisfit between measured and modelled data. Not fully min-\nimising the misfit is a way of ensuring that the solution norm\ndoes not grow beyond bounds. In effect this limits the set\nof admissible solutions and can be thought of as a form of a\nconstraint on the solution.\nAlthough hitherto not commonly used in glaciology, the\nBayesian approach to inverse problems applied here is of-\nten used to solve geophysical inverse problems, and we refer\nthe reader to books by Menke (1989), Rodgers (2000), and\nTarantola (2005) for a general description. Bayesian inver-\nsion is a statistical inference method where indirect measure-\nments of some quantity are used in combination with earlier\nestimates of that quantity to arrive at a new and improved es-\ntimate. The estimate is optimal in the sense that it maximises\nthe conditional probability P(x|y) where x is the quantity to\nbe estimated, and y are indirect measurements of x. The in-\ndirect measurements y of x are related to x through y=f (x)\nwhere f is referred to as the forward model. Here, in our\nparticular case, the indirect measurements (y) are measure-\nments of velocity and topography along the upper surface of\na glacier, the quantity x to be estimated is basal topography\nand basal slipperiness.\n2 Theoretical framework\nWe consider the problem of determining basal slipperiness\nand basal topography from measurements of surface topog-\nraphy and surface velocity on glaciers. The forward prob-\nlem consists in solving the full set of the linear momen-\ntum equations \u03c3ij,j+fi=0, the angular momentum equations\n\u03c3ij\u2212\u03c3ji=0, and the incompressibility condition vi,i=0 for\na linear media where \u000f\u02d9ij=\u03c4ij\/(2\u03b7) and for a linear sliding\nlaw ub=c\u03c4b. In these equations \u03c3ij are the elements of the\nCauchy stress tensor, fi the elements of the body force, vi the\nvelocity components, \u000f\u02d9ij are strain rates, \u03c4ij are deviatoric\nstresses, \u03b7 the ice viscosity, ub the basal sliding velocity, \u03c4b\nthe basal shear stress, and c the basal slipperiness. In addition\nto these equations we have the kinematic boundary condi-\ntions at the upper and lower boundaries. We consider steady-\nstate conditions and ignore accumulation and ablation.\nThe model domain is that of a slightly perturbed uniformly\ninclined slap with periodic boundary conditions. The pertur-\nbations that we consider here are perturbations in basal to-\npography and basal slipperiness. Unless otherwise specified,\nthe amplitude of a basal topography perturbation is given\nas a fraction of the mean ice thickness. Correspondingly,\nthe amplitude of a basal slipperiness perturbation is given\nas a fraction of the mean basal slipperiness. For example, a\n(fractional) basal slipperiness perturbation with an amplitude\nequal to 0.1 corresponds to a 0.1c\u00af perturbation in basal slip-\nperiness, where c\u00af is the mean basal slipperiness. We have\nu\u00afb=c\u00af\u03c4\u00afb where u\u00afb and \u03c4\u00afb are the mean basal sliding velocity\nand the mean basal shear stress, respectively.\n2.1 Notation\nMeasurements are available at discrete points, and we refer\nto the set of all surface measurement values as the measure-\nment vector. When referring to this (finite) set of surface\nmeasurements, the corresponding vectors are written in bold\nface.\nThe variables to be estimated are the vectors b and c giving\nthe bed topography and basal slipperiness along the profile.\nWe lump these vectors together into one system state vector\nx and, think of x as consisting of two subvectors x1 and x2\nwhere x1=b and x2=c. Hence x=(b, c)H , where H denotes\nthe Hermitian transpose. We use the Hermitian transpose be-\ncause the inversion is done in Fourier space where all vari-\nables are complex.\nSurface data is lumped together into the measurement vec-\ntor y. The set of surface data considered here are measure-\nments of surface topography (s), and the horizontal and ver-\ntical velocity components u and w, respectively. For nota-\ntional convenience we split y into three subvectors and write\ny1=s, y2=u, y3=w. Hence y=(s,u,w)H . We also write\n\u000f1=\u000fs , \u000f2=\u000fu, and \u000f3=\u000fw, where \u000fs , \u000fu, and \u000fw are the cor-\nresponding surface measurement errors.\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 167\u2013178, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/167\/2008\/\nG. H. Gudmundsson and M. Raymond: Surface inversion on ice streams 169\nThe set of all parameters entering the problem that are not\nsolved for as a part of the inversion procedure is denoted by\np. These parameters include, for example, those related to\nice rheology.\nA tilde above a quantity denotes an a priori estimate while\na hat above a quantity denotes an a posteriori estimate. Thus\nx is the true system state while x\u02dc, and x\u02c6 are the a priori and\nthe a posteriori estimates, respectively. Measurement val-\nues are denoted by a hat above the corresponding quantity.\nWe write for example s\u02c6=s+\u000fs where s\u02c6 is the surface mea-\nsurement vector, s is the true surface and \u000fs the error in the\nsurface measurement.\n2.2 Linear forward problem\nThe relationship between surface measurements and basal\nvariables is written as\uf8eb\uf8ed s\u02c6u\u02c6\nw\u02c6\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 = f (b, c,p)+\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u000fs\u000fu\n\u000fw\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 , (1)\nwhere f is the forward model. We have assumed here that\nthe forward model is perfect in the sense that it correctly de-\nscribes the relationship between basal (x) and surface (y)\nfields when exact estimates of model parameters (p) and\nbasal quantities are available.\nIn Fourier space the relationship between horizontal and\nvertical surface velocity components (u and w), surface to-\npography (s) and the basal variables b and c can be described\nthrough transfer functions. Here we use the transfer func-\ntions given by Gudmundsson (2003). Surface and bedrock\nvariables are related through\nyi = yiTxj xj , (2)\nwhere the summation convention is used, and yiTxj are trans-\nfer functions. It is useful to use extended transfer functions,\ndefined as\nyiTx = (yiTb yiTc), (3)\nThese matrices have the dimensions m\u00d72n where n is the\nnumber of locations along the bedline at which c and b is to\nbe estimated, and m is the number of measurement sites at\nthe surface where s, u and w have been measured.\nIn general, no notational difference is made between the\nsame function in spatial and frequency domain. In the dis-\ncrete case, the forward Fourier transform of the correspond-\ning measurement vector s is given by Fs where F is the\nunitary discrete Fourier transform matrix. The discrete for-\nward Fourier transform of the covariance matrix C is given\nby FCFH where H denotes the Hermitian transpose.\n2.3 Description of errors\nCovariance matrices are denoted by the upper case letter C.\nThe covariance matrices considered here will almost all be\nerror covariance matrices, where the expectation value op-\nerator is taken about the true value of some quantity. The\nerror in surface topography measurements is, for example,\ndescribed through the covariance matrix\nCss\u02c6 =< (s\u02c6 \u2212 s)(s\u02c6 \u2212 s)H >, (4)\nor simply as\nCss\u02c6 =< \u000fs\u000fHs > . (5)\nWe assume that measurement errors are normally distributed\nand uncorrelated.\nThe error in the prior estimate is described by the covari-\nance of the ensemble of states about the prior state\nCxx\u02dc =< (x \u2212 x\u02dc)((x \u2212 x\u02dc)H ) > . (6)\nWe assume that the prior estimates of bed topography and\nbasal slipperiness are mutually uncorrelated and write Cxx\u02dc\non the form\nCxx\u02dc =\n[\n< (b \u2212 b\u02dc)(b \u2212 b\u02dc)H > 0\n0 < (c \u2212 c\u02dc)(c \u2212 c\u02dc)H >\n]\n. (7)\nWe know of no studies were the spatial correlation in basal\ntopography or basal slipperiness have been estimated. It\nseems, however, unlikely that basal topography and basal\nslipperiness are spatially uncorrelated. A reasonable model\nfor the prior basal topography covariance\nC\nbb\u02dc\n=< (b \u2212 b\u02dc)(b \u2212 b\u02dc)H >, (8)\nis a stationary first-order auto-regressive process (Box et al.,\n1994) where the prior estimate of the basal topography at\nlocation i is related to that at location i\u22121 through\nb\u02dci = \u03c6b\u02dc b\u02dci\u22121 + \u000fb\u02dc, (9)\nwhere \u000f\nb\u02dc\nis uncorrelated with variance \u03c3 2. It follows (Box\net al., 1994) that the elements of the covariance matrix C\nbb\u02dc\nare\n[C\nbb\u02dc\n]ij = \u03c3 2b\u02dc e\u2212|i\u2212j |\/\u03bbb\u02dc , (10)\nwhere the decay length scale \u03bb\nb\u02dc\nis related to \u03c6\nb\u02dc\nthrough\n\u03bb\nb\u02dc\n= \u22121\/ ln\u03c6\nb\u02dc\n, (11)\nand the variance is\n\u03c3 2\nb\u02dc\n= \u03c3 2\/(1 \u2212 \u03c62\nb\u02dc\n). (12)\nThe two parameters \u03bb\nb\u02dc\nand \u03c3 2\nb\u02dc\ndefine the covariance model.\nWe refer to \u03c3\nb\u02dc\nas the error in prior basal topography. In what\nfollows this error will usually be defined in terms of the mean\nice thickness h\u00af. For example, for a 10 % error in prior basal\ntopography we have \u03c3b=0.1h\u00af.

With the exception of the results shown in Fig. 1,\nwhich is an illustration of one particular synthetic inversion\nexperiment, all the results given below are not affected by the\nexact value of \u03bb\nb\u02dc\nAn identical model is used for the prior basal slipperiness\ncovariance\nCcc\u02dc =< (c \u2212 c\u02dc)(c \u2212 c\u02dc)H >, (13)\nas for the basal topography, and the corresponding model pa-\nrameters are denoted by \u03c3c\u02dc and \u03bbc\u02dc. A 10 % error in basal\nslipperiness corresponds to \u03c3c\u02dc=0.1c\u00af.\nOne of the reasons for using this model for the prior co-\nvariance Cxx\u02dc is that analytical expression for its inverse\n(C\u22121\nxx\u02dc\n) and its Fourier transform (FCxx\u02dcFH ) can easily be\ndetermined (Box et al., 1994). Cxx\u02dc is the only full covari-\nance matrix entering as an input variable to the problem, and\nhaving analytical expressions for its inverse, and its Fourier\ntransform, significantly speeds up the inversion procedure.\nThe retrieval error is described through the covariance ma-\ntrix\nCxx\u02c6 =< (x \u2212 x\u02c6)(x \u2212 x\u02c6)H > . (14)\nIn general we expect Cxx\u02c6 to be a full covariance matrix and\nthe estimates of basal topography and basal slipperiness to\nbe correlated.\n2.4 Inverse problem\nThe retrieval (x\u02c6) is a function of surface data vectors (s\u02c6, u\u02c6,\nw\u02c6), the prior estimate of the system state (x\u02dc), and the set of\nestimated model parameters (p\u02c6), that is\nx\u02c6 = x\u02c6(s\u02c6, u\u02c6, w\u02c6, x\u02dc, p\u02c6). (15)\nWe seek to determine a system state that maximises the con-\nditional probability P(b, c|u, v,w).

(24)\nWe refer to this error component as the \u201cprior retrieval error\u201d,\n\u000fr .\nThe second term on the right-hand side of expression\nEq. (20) is the retrieval error due to errors in the forward\nmodel parameters and the sensitivity of the retrieval to the\nforward model parameters. We refer to this error compo-\nnent as the \u201cforward-model parameter retrieval error\u201d, \u000ff .\nHere we assume that errors in forward model parameters are\nsmall. If not, the corresponding model parameters should be\nincluded as a part of the system state.\nThe third term on the right-hand side of Eq. (20) is the\nretrieval error due to measurement errors (\u000fn) and the sensi-\ntivity of the retrieval to measurements. The (total) retrieval\nerror given by Eq. (18) is the sum of the retrieval error due to\nmeasurements errors and the prior retrieval error.\nFor the MAP estimate given above and the definition of\nx\u02c6Ax , it follows, using the chain rule and the assumption that\nmeasurements are unbiased and errors uncorrelated, that\nx\u02c6Ax = Cxx\u02c6(sTHx C\u22121ss\u02c6 sTx + uTHx C\u22121uu\u02c6uTx (25)\n+wTHx C\u22121ww\u02c6wTx)\nWe refer to x\u02c6Ax as the averaging kernel matrix. The matrix\nx\u02c6Ax is, in general, not a symmetrical matrix. It is a 2n\u00d72n\nmatrix, where 2n is the number of elements in x. x\u02c6Ax can be\nwritten as\nx\u02c6Ax =\n(\nb\u02c6Ab b\u02c6Ac\nc\u02c6Ab c\u02c6Ac\n)\n, (26)\nwhere each of the blocks b\u02c6Ab, b\u02c6Ac, c\u02c6Ab, and c\u02c6Ac are n\u00d7n.\nThe b\u02c6Ac matrix gives the sensitivity of the bedrock retrieval\nto the (true) basal slipperiness distribution, while the c\u02c6Ab ma-\ntrix gives the sensitivity of the estimate of basal slipperiness\nto the (true) bedrock topography. These two averaging ker-\nnel matrices will be referred to as mixing kernel matrices.\nClearly, for a good retrieval these elements of the mixing ker-\nnel matrices should be as small as possible. The elements of\nb\u02c6Ab give the sensitivity of the bedrock-topography retrieval\nto those of the true bedrock topography. Similarly c\u02c6Ac is the\nsensitivity of the slipperiness retrieval to the actual basal slip-\nperiness distribution. We refer to the b\u02c6Ab and the c\u02c6Ac kernels\nas the direct averaging kernel matrices. For good retrieval\nthere should be as little mixing as possible mixing between\nfrequencies while the sensitivity of corresponding frequen-\ncies in the true and estimated system state should be as close\nas possible to one, that is ideally the direct kernels b\u02c6Ab and\nc\u02c6Ac should be unit matrices.\nThe sensitivity of the retrieval x\u02c6 to the prior estimate x\u02dc is\ndefined as\nx\u02c6Ax\u02dc := \u2202x\u02c6\n\u2202x\u02dc\n. (27)\nFrom Eq. (17) we find\nx\u02c6Ax\u02dc = Cxx\u02c6C\u22121xx\u02dc , (28)\nand using either Eq. (20) to calculate x\u02c6Ax\u02dc together with\nEq. (25), or using the above equation in combination with\nEqs. (18) and (25), it follows that\n1 = x\u02c6Ax\u02dc + x\u02c6Ax, (29)\ngiving the relationship between the sensitivity of the retrieval\nto the system state and the prior estimate, and showing that\nthe retrieval is sensitive to either the true system state or the\nprior estimate. Hence, deviations of the averaging kernel ma-\ntrix x\u02c6Ax from the unit matrix is a measure of how sensitive\nthe retrieval is to the prior estimate as opposed to the surface\ndata. Taking the trace of Eq. (29) we can define the number\nof model parameters resolved by the measurements as tr x\u02c6Ax\nand the number of model parameters resolved by the prior in-\nformation as tr x\u02c6Ax\u02dc . The number of basal quantities resolved\nby the surface measurements (ds) is therefore\nds = tr x\u02c6Ax, (30)\ni.e. the trace of the averaging kernel matrix.\n3 Results\nAs an illustration of the method we start by showing results\nof an inversion using synthetic data. We stress that apart from\nthis one example, none of the following results depend on the\nuse of synthetic data.\nThe forward calculation was done for an ice stream with a\nmean surface slope of 0.005, and a slip ratio of 500, where\nthe slip ratio is defined as the ratio between mean basal slid-\ning velocity and forward velocity due to shearing through the\nice column. Spatially uncorrelated and normally distributed\ndata errors were added. Surface topography errors were 1%\nof mean thickness, and errors in both horizontal and vertical\nvelocity components were set at 1% of mean surface velocity.\nThe spacing between measurements was equal to one mean\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/167\/2008\/ The Cryosphere, 2, 167\u2013178, 2008\n172 G. H. Gudmundsson and M. Raymond: Surface inversion on ice streams\nice thickness. The prior for the basal topography and the\nbasal slipperiness was modelled as a covariance-stationary\nfirst order auto-regressive model with zero mean as described\nin the previous section. Both decay lengths (\u03bb\nb\u02dc\nand \u03bbc\u02dc) were\nset at 25 h\u00af (see Eq. 11). The error was 10% of the respective\nmean values, i.e. \u03c3\nb\u02dc\n=0.1h\u00af and \u03c3c\u02dc=0.1c\u00af (see Eq. 12). Syn-\nthetic prior distributions (x\u02dc) were generated using x\u02dc=C1\/2\nxx\u02dc\n\u000f\nwhere \u000f is a sequence of pseudo random numbers with mean\nzero and unit variance. Gaussian perturbations in true basal\ntopography and true basal slipperiness were prescribed.\nNon-dimensional variables are used. All lenghts are nor-\nmalized with the mean ice thickness. Stresses are normal-\nized with the mean basal shear stress, and velocities by mean\ndeformational velocity. These scaling follow Gudmundsson\n(2003). As before the ratio between mean sliding velocity\nand basal shear stress is referred to as the basal slipperiness.\nIn non-dimensional variables this ratio is also equal to the\nratio between mean sliding velocity and mean deformational\nvelocity, that is, to the slip ratio. Hence, in the following the\nterms \u201cslip ratio\u201d and \u201cbasal slipperiness\u201d are interchange-\nable.\nAn inversion of synthetically generated surface data with\nadded errors was performed using Eq. (17). As Fig. 1 shows,\nthe retrieved bedrock perturbation (blue line, Fig. 1a) traces\nthe true perturbation (black line) quite accurately. The re-\ntrieval errors are given by Eq. (18). These errors are in gen-\neral correlated and for that reason somewhat difficult to vi-\nsualise. In Fig. 1, the square root of the diagonal elements\nof Cxx\u02c6 is used to bracket the range of possible retrievals (red\nlines). As explained above this error can be thought of as\nthe sum of the prior retrieval error (\u000fr ) given by Eq. (24)\nand retrieval error due to measurement errors (\u000fn). For the\nbasal topography retrieval, the prior retrieval error compo-\nnent, shown as cyan line in Fig. 1a, is a small fraction of\nthe total retrieval error (red line, Fig. 1a). Hence, the error\nin basal topography retrieval is mostly due to surface mea-\nsurement errors rather than errors in prior estimates of basal\nproperties.\nIn comparison to the estimate of basal topography, the re-\ntrieved basal slipperiness perturbation (blue line, Fig. 1b) is\na much poorer estimate of the true basal perturbation (black\nline, Fig. 1b). As Fig. 1b shows, the main contribution to\nthe total retrieval error (red line) is due to errors in the prior\nestimate (cyan line). It follows that increasing the accuracy\nof the surface data somewhat will not lead to significant im-\nprovements in slipperiness retrieval and that the main limita-\ntion to further improvement in slipperiness retrieval is insen-\nsitivity of the retrieval to surface data.\n3.1 Spatial resolution and mixing effects\nInversion of synthetic data of the type shown in Fig. 1 can\nbe instructive and helpful in identifying problems with the\ninversion method. However the usefulness of such an inver-\nsion exercise is limited by the need to prescribe a particular\nform of basal perturbation.\nA general description of the sensitivity of the retrieval to\nthe system state is given by the averaging kernel matrix x\u02c6Ax\n(see Eqs. 21 and 25). Considering the averaging kernel ma-\ntrix in frequency space we note that for each of the blocks\nb\u02c6Ab, b\u02c6Ac, c\u02c6Ab, and c\u02c6Ac, the i-th row represents the sensi-\ntivity of the retrieval to a system state consisting of white\nphaseless noise. If there is no mixing between frequencies,\nthat is if one frequency in the retrieval is only related to that\nsame frequency of the system state, then the only non-zero\nelements of the i-th row of these blocks is at location i of the\ncorresponding block. It follows that for each of the blocks\nb\u02c6Ab, b\u02c6Ac, c\u02c6Ab, and c\u02c6Ac, the numerical difference between\nthe element at location i, and the sum over all elements of\nthe i-th row, can be taken as a measure of frequency mixing.\nSimilarly, for each of the blocks b\u02c6Ab, b\u02c6Ac, c\u02c6Ab, and c\u02c6Ac the\ni-th columns give the frequency spread, i.e. the sensitivity of\nall frequencies of the retrieval to one single frequency of the\nsystem state.\nA further undesirable mixing effect is represented by the\nblocks b\u02c6Ac and the c\u02c6Ab. These give, respectively, the sensi-\ntivity of the basal topography retrieval to true basal slipperi-\nness, and the sensitivity of the retrieved basal slipperiness to\ntrue basal topography. For a good retrieval these matrix ele-\nments should not only be small in comparison to unity, they\nshould also be small in comparison to the diagonal elements\nalong the same rows of the averaging kernel matrices b\u02c6Ab\nand c\u02c6Ac.\nFigure 2 shows the sensitivity of the retrieval to true sys-\ntem state in frequency space. The curves in the figure fol-\nlow from Eqs. (25) and definition (26). The difference be-\ntween solid and dashed lines of same colour represent fre-\nquency mixing effects. The green and the cyan lines rep-\nresent mixing between basal topography and basal slipper-\niness in the retrieval. The figure was calculated assuming\nerrors in surface measurements of topography and velocity\nequal to 1% of mean values of ice thickness and surface\nspeed. For an ice stream with thickness of 1000 m and sur-\nface speed of 1 m d\u22121 this translates to 10 m elevation errors\nand 0.01m d\u22121 errors in horizontal and vertical velocity com-\nponents. Airborne measurements of surface topography can\neasily reach this kind of accuracy (Vaughan et al., 2006),\nand both repeated annual surveying of stakes positions us-\ning GPS techniques and InSAR velocity measurements give\nsurface velocities within or comparable to this level of error\n(Joughin, 1995; King, 2004; Dach et al., 2009).\nThe dashed-lined red curve in Fig. 2 shows the size of\nthe diagonal elements of the b\u02c6Ab averaging kernel matrix.\nThese are close to unity showing that bedrock topography\nis well resolved down the wavelengths comparable to one\nmean ice thickness.

The solid lines (1\u2212n) show the sensitivity of the retrieval as\na function of wavelength to all wavelengths of the true basal condi-\ntions. The difference between the solid and the dashed lines of same\ncolour is a measure for undesirable frequency mixing effects. The\nred lines show the sensitivity of the estimate of basal topography to\nthe true basal topography, and the blue lines the sensitivity of esti-\nmated basal slipperiness to true basal slipperiness. The green and\nthe cyan lines represent further undesirable mixing effects where\nbedrock perturbations affect estimates of basal slipperiness (cyan\nlines) or where estimates of bedrock topography are contaminated\nby variations in basal slipperiness. The figure was calculated using\na surface slope of 0.005 and mean slip ratio of 500. Surface mea-\nsurement locations were one ice thickness apart and surface data\nerrors were 1% of ice thickness and mean surface velocity. prior\nvalues for basal topography and basal slipperiness were modelled\nas first-order auto-regressive processes with decay length scales of\n25h\u00af and 10% errors.\ndifference between the solid and the dashed red curves im-\nplies that frequency mixing is not a significant problem for\nbedrock topography retrieval.\nThe small difference between the dashed and the solid blue\nlines in Fig. 2 shows that frequency mixing does not pose a\nproblem for basal slipperiness retrieval either. However the\nspatial resolution is somewhat limited with sensitivity greater\nthan 0.5 only for wavelengths larger than about 40\u201350 ice\nthicknesses.\nMixing between different types of basal perturbations is\nrepresented by the green and cyan curves in Fig. 2.

The blue curve in\nthe lower panel is the sensitivity of the basal topography retrieval to\nbasal slipperiness, and the green curve is the sensitivity of the basal\nslipperiness retrieval to point perturbation in basal topography. Val-\nues of all model parameters are same as those used in Fig. 2.\nence between the dashed and the solid cyan lines, this mixing\nbetween basal slipperiness retrieval and basal topography is\ncombined with frequency mixing. Hence, sinusoidal pertur-\nbations in basal topography are aliased into basal slipperi-\nness perturbations (b to c mixing) at different wavelengths\n(frequency mixing).\nFrom Fig. 2 it is not clear which frequencies of the sys-\ntem state contribute to frequency mixing. It is also diffi-\ncult to visualise the spatial resolving power of the retrieval\nmethod from a frequency-space representation such as the\none in Fig. 2. A different way of looking at the averaging\nkernels is to consider the \u201cpoint spread functions\u201d shown in\nFig. 3. The point spread functions represent the spatial, as\nopposed to the frequency, sensitivity of the retrieval to a lo-\ncalised point perturbations in system state.

Values\nof all relevant parameters such as average slope, data errors\nand data spacing are the same as in Fig. 2.\nThe strong differences in spatial resolution of the basal to-\npography retrieval in comparison to that of the basal slipperi-\nness retrieval is clearly seen in Fig. 3a. As the figure shows, a\npoint perturbation in the system state of b is retrieved almost\nperfectly while the retrieval of a point perturbation in basal\nslipperiness retrieval is broad.\nThe degree of mixing between different types of basal per-\nturbations is shown in Fig. 3b. As Fig. 2 showed in a different\nway, this type of mixing is not strong. In particular there is\nalmost no mixing with the basal slipperiness in the basal to-\npography retrieval. The green curve in Fig. 3b shows that\npoint perturbation in b leads to some reduction in slipperi-\nness in upstream direction from a bedrock disturbance and a\nsimilar increases in downstream direction.\n3.2 Number of resolved basal quantities\nOur discussion above on spatial resolution and mixing ef-\nfects was limited to one particular set of parameters defining\ndata errors and data spacing. All surface data errors were\n1% of mean values or ice thickness and horizontal speed, and\nprior errors were set at 10% of mean thickness and mean slip-\nperiness with decay length scale equal to 25 ice thicknesses.\nFurthermore, the spacing between measurement sites at the\nsurface was equal to one mean ice thickness. We will now\ninvestigate the effects of surface data errors and spacing on\nthe number of resolved basal quantities as given by Eq. (30).\nA convenient measure of information on basal proper-\nties gained by surface measurements is the number of re-\nsolved basal parameters per measuring site at the surface. As\nEq. (30) shows the total number of basal quantities resolved\nby surface measurements equals the trace of the x\u02c6Ax averag-\ning kernel matrix. For both basal topography and basal slip-\nperiness the maximum number of resolved parameters is n,\nand the maximum total number of resolved parameters there-\nfore 2n. The number of measuring sites at the surface is m,\nand at each of these sites we have three data values giving\nthe surface elevation and the horizontal and vertical velocity\ncomponent at that site. In the following we assume that the\nnumber of measurement sites equals the number of locations\nalong the bedline where estimates of basal quantities are to\nbe updated, that is m=n. The number of resolved basal to-\npography (d\u00afbs ) and basal slipperiness (d\u00afcs ) quantities per mea-\nsurement site is then\nd\u00afbs =\n1\nn\ntr b\u02c6Ab, (31)\nand\nd\u00afcs =\n1\nn\ntr c\u02c6Ac, (32)\nrespectively. If, for example, the number of resolved basal to-\npography quantities per measurement site is close to unity, all\nof the surface data sites are contributing significantly more to\nthe estimate of basal topography than the prior information.\nIf this number is equal to 0.5, the sensitivity of the retrieval\nto surface data is equal to its sensitivity to prior information.\nIt should be noted that there are number of other possi-\nble ways of quantifying the information content of the sur-\nface measurements. One could for example define the in-\nformation content of surface measurements in terms of the\nreduction in entropy (Shannon and Weaver, 1949; Togneri\nand DeSilva, 2003), in which case the difference between\nthe covariance of the MAP solution and the covariance of the\nprior is taken as a measure of how much the measurements\nhave affected our estimate of the system state. We calculated\nthe Shannon information content but found, as have other\nauthors (e.g. Purser and Huang, 1993), that this measure of\ninformation has some undesirable properties. For example,\ndespite being only of local influence, a single precise mea-\nsurement greatly alters this measure of information.\nFigure 4 shows how data errors affect the number of re-\nsolved basal quantities per surface measurement site as a\nfunction of distance between sites. Data errors are shown\nas percentages of corresponding mean values. A 0.1% data\nerror implies, as an example, a 0.001h\u00af error in surface to-\npography and a 0.001u\u00af error in both horizontal and vertical\nvelocity components, where u\u00af is the mean surface speed. Ide-\nally, the number of resolved quantities per site would be close\nto unity. Note also that a slope of zero in Fig. 4 represents\na situation where the effect of reducing the spacing between\nmeasurement sites is a directly proportional increase in the\ntotal number of resolved basal quantities.\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 167\u2013178, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/167\/2008\/\nG.

Almost identically many basal topography parameters\ncan be resolved in the absence of information about surface\ntopography from knowing the surface velocity vector alone.\nIt is only for distances above about 20 ice thicknesses that\nnot knowing the surface topography starts to significantly de-\ngrade the b retrieval. A further interesting aspect of Fig. 5 is\nhow unimportant the vertical velocity component (w) is for\nthe c retrieval. In fact, not knowing w has such a small ef-\nfect on d\u00afcs that the corresponding blue coloured dash-dotted\ncurve in Fig. 5, showing d\u00afcs for s and u but not w known, is\nnot visible under the thicker solid blue curve giving d\u00afcs for all\nof s, u and w known.\n10\u22121 100 101 102\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\ndistance between measurement sites (h)\nn\nu\nm\nbe\nr o\nf r\nes\nol\nve\nd \nba\nsa\nl q\nua\nnt\nitie\ns \npe\nr s\nite\n \n \nBasal \ntopography\nBasal \nslipperiness\n30 %  error in \na priori estimates \nof basal topography\n1% error in \na priori estimates \nof basal topography\nFig. 6. Number of resolved basal topography (red curves) and basal\nslipperiness (blue curves) quantities as a function of distance be-\ntween measurement sites at the surface for different error estimates\nfor the prior basal topography. The thick and the thin curves were\ncalculated given 1% and 30% uncertainty, respectively, in the prior\nbasal topography.\nThe basal slipperiness retrieval can be expected to be im-\nproved when accurate prior information on basal topography\nis available. Figure 6 shows the number or basal quantities\nresolved by surface measurements for two different error es-\ntimates of prior basal topography. Comparison of the two\nblue lines in that figure shows that improving the estimates\nof prior basal topography from 30% error level to 1% error\ndoes indeed increase the number of resolved basal slipperi-\nness quantities. However, that improvement is modest and\nthe increase in d\u00afcs no larger than about 0.1 (Fig. 6). We con-\nclude that a good prior knowledge of basal topography is not\nan essential requirement for successful retrieval of basal slip-\nperiness.\nThe number of basal topography quantities resolved by\nthe prior clearly must increase with decreasing prior errors.\nHence the significant drop in d\u00afbs values with reduced errors\nin prior basal topography seen in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the\nsensitivity of the basal topography retrieval to surface data is\nstill around 0.2 to 0.3 for site distances above one mean ice\nthickness for only 1% errors in prior basal topography (see\nFig. 6). Hence, it is important to solve for both b and c even\nwhen accurate independent estimates of b are available. Not\nsolving for b when basal topography is known corresponds\nto artificially suppressing the sensitivity of the b retrieval to\nsurface data to zero, whereas in fact, as Fig. 6 shows, the ac-\ntual sensitivity for just 1% prior errors in b is around 0.2 to\n0.3. Ignoring this sensitivity will inevitably cause a bias in\nthe c estimate. The magnitude of this bias can be estimated\nby considering the mixing terms of the kernel matrix x\u02c6Ax\u02dc .\nFrom Eq. (29) and using Eq. (26) we find that sensitivity of\nthe c retrieval to prior estimates of b is the negative of c\u02c6Ab.\nAs we have seen this mixing term can be as large as about\nwww.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/167\/2008\/ The Cryosphere, 2, 167\u2013178, 2008\n176 G. H. Gudmundsson and M. Raymond: Surface inversion on ice streams\n0.3 for wavelengths between around 20 to 50 ice thicknesses\nwith most of that contribution due to frequency mixing (see\nsolid cyan curve in Fig. 2). We note that Fig. 2 was calcu-\nlated for a \u03c3\nb\u02dc\n=0.1h\u00af and that the exact errors in c retrieval\ndue to incorrect error estimates for the prior basal topogra-\nphy will change somewhat as a function of \u03c3\nb\u02dc\n. Inspection of\nx\u02c6Ax and its blocks shows that with decreasing prior errors\nin basal topography the sensitivity of the c retrieval to per-\nturbations in true basal topography increases sharply and can\neasily become much larger than unity.\nThe sensitivity of the retrieval of basal slipperiness and\nbasal stress to errors in basal topography was investigated\nby Joughin et al. (2004). They solved for basal shear stress\nonly, without allowing for any variations in basal topogra-\nphy. Contrary to our findings they concluded that errors in\nbasal shear stress estimates did not increase markedly with\nerrors in basal topography. Similar conclusions were drawn\nby Vieli and Payne (2003) who inverted for basal slipperi-\nness with, and without, a simultaneous inversion for bedrock\ntopography, and found that in both cases the resulting basal\nslipperiness was quite similar. It is possible that the root of\nsome of this difference might be in the use of different for-\nward models. Joughin et al. (2004) solved the shallow ice\nstream equation for non-linear media while we solve the full\nStokes system for linear media. However, it is also possible\nthat this difference is related to difference in the way the sen-\nsitivity experiments were performed. Joughin et al. (2004)\nsolved the diagnostic equation for each change in input pa-\nrameters. The prognostic equation was not used to ensure\nthat both the rate of surface elevation changes and the sur-\nface mass balance were within set limits. This is an approach\nfollowed by number of other authors (e.g., Vieli and Payne,\n2003). In this study we have assumed zero surface mass bal-\nance and zero rate of surface change with time and have ac-\ncordingly calculated the steady state surface topography and\nsurface velocities corresponding to zero surface mass balance\nfor any given change in basal quantities. It seems likely that\nthe sensitivities of retrieved basal quantities to errors in basal\ntopography when a) surface topography is held constant, and\nwhen b) corresponding steady state surface topography is\ncalculated, are not the same. The differences between our\nconclusions and those of Joughin et al. (2004) could, hence\nbe due to differences in the way the sensitivity of retrieval to\nerrors in basal topography is defined.\n4 Limitations and possible extensions\nA key feature of the retrieval method is the use of analyt-\nical transfer functions, that describe the effects of small-\namplitude perturbations in basal conditions on surface ge-\nometry and surface velocity, as a forward model. The trans-\nfer functions used here are solutions to the full Stokes sys-\ntem and only valid for Newtonian media and a linear slid-\ning law. However, the effects of a non-linear sliding law\non surface-to-bed retrieval on ice streams, over horizontal\nspatial scales that are large compared to the mean ice thick-\nness, could be studied by using the transfer functions given\nin Gudmundsson (2008). Doing so would require no essen-\ntial modifications to the method as presented here. Including\nfinite-amplitude effects in combination with non-linear ice\nrheology and non-linear sliding law requires a fully numeri-\ncal treatment. This non-linear retrieval problem can, for ex-\nample, be solved using an iterative procedure where forward\nmodel derivatives are approximated by the analytical trans-\nfer functions. The iterative step of such a method would be\nalmost identical to the method presented and used here. This\nextension of the method to non-linear rheology, non-linear\nsliding law, and finite-amplitude perturbations is the subject\nfuture paper (Raymond and Gudmundsson, 2008).\nTransfer functions for non-linear rheology and non-linear\nsliding have been calculated numerically by Raymond and\nGudmundsson (2005). Qualitatively, the effects of non-linear\nrheology and non-linear sliding on the retrieval can be es-\ntimated by comparing transfer functions calculated for both\nthe linear and non-linear situations. For high slip ratios (>5),\nthe effect of increasing the value of the stress exponent in\nGlen\u2019s flow law is an increase in the ratio between surface\nand bed topography (see Fig. 8b in Raymond and Gudmunds-\nson, 2005, for more detail). For the ratio between surface\ntopography and basal slipperiness the effect is, over most\nwavelengths, the opposite and the (non-dimensional) ratio\nbetween perturbations in surface topography and fractional\nslipperiness decreases with increasing value of the stress ex-\nponent (see Fig. 9b in Raymond and Gudmundsson, 2005,\nfor more detail). This suggests that non-linear rheology may\nimprove the retrieval of basal topography but degrade slip-\nperiness retrieval. However, the picture is complicated by\nthe fact that changing the value of the stress exponent also\naffects surface velocity response to basal perturbations, and\na definitive answer must await a fully non-linear treatment.\nThe method is here only used for data along a flow line and\nwe have not considered the consequences of the transverse\ndimension on retrieval. In particular, we empathise that the\nbounds given above on the spatial resolution of basal slipper-\niness variations have been obtained for a flow-line inversion\nwhere transverse effects have been ignored. Perturbations in\nbasal slipperiness of final transverse width give rise to pat-\nterns of horizontal divergence and convergence (see Figs. 2,\n5c and 5d in Gudmundsson, 2003). It is possible that in many\nsituations the resulting disturbance in horizontal flow veloci-\nties are large enough for perturbations in basal slipperiness of\nfinite width to be extracted from surface data with higher spa-\ntial resolution than suggested by the one-dimensional treat-\nment given here. Based on the transfer characteristics (see\nFig. 5b in Gudmundsson, 2003) it seems, for example, quite\npossible that a transversal sinusoidal perturbation in basal\nslipperiness, i.e. with a crest that is aligned with the flow, can\nbe resolved from surface data down to a (transverse) wave-\nlength considerably shorter than the limit of about 50h\u00af given\nThe Cryosphere, 2, 167\u2013178, 2008 www.the-cryosphere.net\/2\/167\/2008\/\nG. H. Gudmundsson and M. Raymond: Surface inversion on ice streams 177\nhere for longitudinal perturbations. Further support for this\nexpectation comes from Schoof (2004) who found that a nar-\nrow transversal perturbation in basal yield-stress on a per-\nfectly plastic ice stream can significantly affect the horizon-\ntal velocity component at the surface (see Fig. 3a in Schoof,\n2004).\nFinally, we have not considered the effects of finite-\namplitude perturbations in basal properties, or the effects\nof form drag on the transmission of basal disturbances to\nthe surface. Our purpose here has been to give as general\na description of the surface-to-bed inverse problem as pos-\nsible using an analytical approach. Finite-amplitude per-\nturbations are inherently non-linear, the superposition prin-\nciple does not apply and making general statements based\non an analytical approach is difficult. However, we do not\nexpect finite-amplitude effects, or the effects of form drag,\nto change our results. Raymond and Gudmundsson (2005)\nfound finite-amplitude effects not to significantly affect the\nbed-to-surface transmission characteristics for small to mod-\nerate basal amplitudes. For example, for sinusoidal basal per-\nturbations with a wavelength \u03bb=5h\u00af, the analytical solutions\nare correct to within a few percent for normalised bedrock\namplitudes (1b\/h\u00af) and fractional slipperiness (1C\/C\u00af) am-\nplitudes up to 0.3h\u00af for a slip ratio of 1000 (see Fig. 3 in Ray-\nmond and Gudmundsson, 2005). For large wavelengths the\nagreement is even better. These findings are in sharp con-\ntrast to conclusions drawn by Schoof (2002) who argued that\nsome of the assumptions behind the analytical approach in\n(Gudmundsson, 2003) start to be violated for bedrock ampli-\ntudes as small as 0.2 m for 1000 m thick icestreams.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nWe have shown how basal topography and basal slipperiness\ncan be retrieved simultaneously from surface measurements\nwithout any significant frequency mixing or mixing between\nthese two different types of basal perturbations. No smooth-\ning of surface data is needed, and once errors in input data,\ni.e. surface data and prior information about basal properties\nare defined, the maximum a posteriori estimate and retrieval\nerrors are uniquely determined.\nWe find that inversion of surface measurements of topog-\nraphy and velocity, combined with approximate estimates of\nmean ice thickness (h\u00af) and mean basal slipperiness, can be\nused to resolve spatial variations in basal topography down\nto about one ice thickness, with the exact number depen-\ndent on data errors and spacing. In comparison, the best ob-\ntainable spatial resolution of basal slipperiness variations is\nmuch more limited. For 1% data errors, for example, small\namplitude spatial variations in basal slipperiness can only be\nresolved for wavelengths larger than about 50 mean ice thick-\nnesses.\nThe number of resolved basal topography quantities per\nmeasurement site is close to unity down to a spacing between\nsites of one h\u00af. For basal slipperiness the corresponding num-\nber is generally much smaller and only larger than 0.6 for\nspacing larger than ten h\u00af and for highly accurate measure-\nments (data errors less than about 0.1% of mean values).\nAccurate prior estimates of basal topography do not sig-\nnificantly improve the retrieval of variations in basal slipper-\niness. This does, however, not imply that measurements of\nbasal topography are not useful in combination with surface-\nto-bed inversion. Such independent information about basal\ntopography can be expected to be useful for both model val-\nidation purposes and prior error covariance modelling.\nThe sensitivity of basal slipperiness retrieval to true basal\ntopography increases sharply with decreasing prior errors in\nbasal topography. Not allowing for some variation in basal\ntopography when solving for spatial variations in basal slip-\nperiness is equivalent to setting prior errors in basal topog-\nraphy to zero. In this case, estimates of basal slipperiness\ncan be significantly affected by unmodelled errors in basal\ntopography.\nAcknowledgements. We would like to thank M. Truffer and\nA.
