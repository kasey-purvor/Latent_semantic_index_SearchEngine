Consequently, companies need to establish and maintain\nappropriate channels for high-quality customer support; either as a part of their own\noperations or through third parties. This paper describes an exploratory investigation\nof the distribution channels and customer support strategies of five manufacturing\nbusinesses, using case study methodology. The results show the key role that customer\nsupport plays in various industries and illustrate the types of decisions companies\nmake on how to provide high-quality support for their customers. These findings have\nimplications for managers in all industries where customer support is important, as\nthey provide insights on how different channels and strategies affect the quality and\nefficiency of customer support.\nKEYWORDS Customer support, after-sales service, distribution channels\nINTRODUCTION\nCustomers for many types of products, ranging from high-technology computer\nsystems to domestic appliances, require customer support i.e. assistance to help them\n3obtain maximum value from their purchases. Consequently, manufacturers need to\nensure that appropriate customer support is available for their products including:-\ninstallation; documentation; maintenance and repair services (generally termed\nservice); user training; telephone support; and equipment upgrading. An important\naspect of customer support is the distribution channel used and whether companies\nhave their own customer support organization, or use third parties (Armistead and\nClark, 1992).\nCustomer support, which is also referred to as product support or after-sales\nservice, is important for manufacturers because it:\n\uf0b7 Can be a major source of revenue (Berg and Loeb, 1990; Goffin, 1998; Hull and\nCox, 1994), although it often receives too little management attention (Knecht et\nal, 1993)\n\uf0b7 Is essential for achieving customer satisfaction\u2014as identified by a number of\nresearchers (Armistead and Clark, 1992; Athaide et al, 1996; Cespedes, 1995;\nDavidow, 1986; Lele and Sheth, 1987; Teresko, 1994).\n\uf0b7 Can provide a competitive advantage (Armistead and Clark, 1992; Davidow, 1986;\nGoffin, 1998; Hull and Cox, 1994). This is true in most high-tech industries\n(Goffin, 1994; Lawless, and Fisher, 1990; Meldrum, 1995) but also in some low-\ntech sectors (Moriarty and Kosnik, 1989)\n\uf0b7 Plays a role in increasing the success rate of new products (Cooper and\nKleinschmidt, 1993);\nDespite its importance, support is a neglected area on which too little has been\npublished (Hull and Cox, 1994). However, \u201cincreasingly, after-sales customer service\nis... being recognized as an important research priority\u201d (Loomba, 1996). This article\n4reviews the literature and describes case study research in five different companies\nwhich had three main objectives:\n\uf0b7 To investigate the nature of customer support in different industries and its\nimportance in achieving customer satisfaction\n\uf0b7 To examine the distribution channels used for customer support\n\uf0b7 To obtain an understanding of the factors which influence companies\u2019 strategies for\ncustomer support.\nThe results show that customer support is important in each of the five markets\ninvestigated\u2014telecommunications, automobiles, vending machines, aircraft and\ndomestic appliances. They also illustrate the different types of distribution channel\nused for customer support. The research has implications for managers in any industry\nwhere support plays a significant role. Due to the importance of the area, further\ninvestigations are necessary and suitable approaches are recommended.\nKEY ELEMENTS OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT\nFrom the literature, seven main elements of after-sales support can be identified which\nmust be provided to customers over the working lifetime of products. These are:\ninstallation; user training; documentation; maintenance and repair; on-line support;\nwarranty; and upgrades. The main characteristics of these elements are:-\n\uf0b7 Installation. For many products, the first element of product support following the\nsale is installation. For complex products (e.g. computer systems), or where safety\nissues are involved (e.g. medical devices), this is usually performed by personnel\nfrom the manufacturing company, or their representatives. Increasingly, where\nproduct design allows it, customers themselves will install their purchases and\nmanufacturers face the challenge of making this easy for, often, non-technically\n5minded customers. A good example of the importance of easy installation is that\nIBM recognized in 1990 that their personal computer (PC) customers wanted to be\nable to unpack their purchases and have them running quickly. This led to products\nwith pre-installed software and which consequently could be unpacked, assembled,\nswitched-on and in use within five minutes (Haug, 1990). Ease-of-installation can\nalso be an important consideration in sectors such as networking products (Taylor,\n1995), or computer systems (Cespedes, 1995).\n\uf0b7 User Training. The complexity of some types of equipment necessitates that\nmanufacturers provide good training for users. For example, hospital staff need to\nbe well-trained in the use of critical care devices (Cespedes, 1995; Goffin, 1998)\nand the successful implementation of process innovations, such as new\nmanufacturing equipment, depends on extensive training being given over a long\nperiod (Athaide et al, 1996). Many computer-based products include functions\nwhich help users learn to use them more efficiently; these can range from simple\nHelp functions, to full training packages as offered by manufacturers such as IBM\n(Bauer et al, 1992). However, training costs can still be very high\u2014business users\nhave to invest significant amounts of money in training their employees in efficient\nuse of personal computers (Taylor, 1995). For simpler products, training is not\nnecessary and details of product operation are usually given in user documentation.\n\uf0b7 Documentation. Most products have some form of documentation and in industries\nsuch as medical electronics it plays a key role (Goffin and Price, 1996). Typical\nforms of documentation cover equipment operation; installation; maintenance; and\nrepair (ibid). Good documentation can lead to lower support costs and increased\nproductivity (Miskie, 1989), however, the documentation for many products is\npoorly written and hard to understand (ibid) (Anonymous, 1997). New technology\n6is being applied to documentation and, for example, CD-ROMs are making car\nservicing more efficient (Fisher et al, 1991).\n\uf0b7 Maintenance and Repair. Historically, maintenance and repair has been an\nimportant element of product support, which has required companies to invest\nsignificant resources. For example, an estimated 500,000 car mechanics are\nemployed in the USA (Mandel, 1995). If equipment fails, fast and efficient repair is\nessential in many markets because \u201cdown-time costs run typically at anywhere\nfrom 100 to 10,000 times the price of spare parts or service\u201d (Knecht et al, 1993).\nIn markets where product failure has strong implications\u2014for example computer\nsystems for financial institutions\u2014companies need to offer either equipment which\nis very reliable (or even never fails), or a rapid response to expedite repairs (Lele\nand Karmarkar, 1983). One way to achieve a fast response is to provide customers\nwith loaner equipment in the event of breakdowns, where this is feasible (Loomba,\n1996). Another strategy for maintenance and repair is to design disposable\nproducts; the approach used by some companies for watches, torches and other\nproducts. Where repair costs do not exceed a significant percentage of product\nreplacement costs, having repairable products is the best strategy for companies\n(Lele and Karmarkar, 1983). For repairable products, it makes sense for companies\nto develop good diagnostics\u2014efficient means to test for problems and identify the\ncauses (Karmarkar, and Kubat, 1987). However, where products are becoming\ncheaper and more reliable, as is the case with PCs, service is becoming less viable\n(Mandel, 1995). In order to repair faulty equipment, companies need to have\nefficient logistics for the management and movement of spares, the parts used in\nrepairs. Some companies have focused strongly on this area, to gain an advantage\nover their competitors (Hull and Cox, 1994; Lele and Sheth, 1987).\n7Maintenance, also referred to as preventive maintenance is undertaken to clean,\nrefurbish or replace parts of equipment which otherwise would be liable to fail.\nMechanical parts, for example, normally require regular maintenance as in the case\nof cars. In the computer sector, where fewer mechanical parts are involved, remote\nsupport technology enables computers to be \u201cupdated... diagnosed and repaired\u201d by\nlinking them to manufacturers\u2019 support centers via telephone lines (Bauer et al,\n1992). The US earth-moving equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, which focuses\non product serviceability\u2014products that are easy to maintain and repair\u2014is using\nsimilar approaches. This has led them to develop products which can be remotely\nmonitored so that maintenance can be performed before faults occur (Fites, 1996).\n\uf0b7 On-Line Support. Telephone advice on products is a major element of customer\nsupport in many industries. Product experts give on-line consulting to customers to\nhelp them use products more efficiently or, sometimes to trace the cause of faults\n(troubleshooting). Whenever problems can be solved over the telephone, costs are\nmuch lower than an engineer having to visit the customer site. On-line support is\nparticularly strongly utilized for software products (software support) (Armistead\nand Clark, 1992). For example companies such as Microsoft have invested\nsignificant resources in telephone centers (Dubashi, 1992) and support costs are\ntypically 6% of revenues in the software industry (Blaisdel, 1990). Many software\nproducts can now be remotely configured, so that they more exactly match\ncustomer requirements\u2014for example, Microsoft\u2019s Windows 95 product has this\ncapability (Taylor, 1995).\n\uf0b7 Warranty. Manufacturers of most products offer warranty and, in some markets\nsuch as automobiles, manufacturers may try to gain a competitive advantage by\noffering longer warranty periods. Warranty reduces the financial risk of owning\n8products and therefore it is an important element of customer support (Lele and\nSheth, 1987; Loomba, 1996). Over the lifetime of a product, support costs may be\ngreater than the initial purchase price. In the computer sector these costs are\nreferred to as cost-of-ownership and \u201cthe costs of buying and operating computer\nhardware for the office are rather like an iceberg - most of them are hidden\u201d\n(Taylor, 1995). Consequently, as products have become more complex and support\ncosts have increased, customers have started to demand more economical and\neffective support (Loomba, 1996). To reduce the risk of expensive repairs, many\nmanufacturers offer customers the possibility to purchase extended warranty.\nHowever in the domestic appliance sector, manufacturers have been accused of\ncharging excessively for this cover (Lodge, 1998).\n\uf0b7 Upgrades. Offering customers the chance to enhance the performance of existing\nproducts can be an important aspect of support (Cespedes, 1995; Davidow, 1986).\nFor example, computer manufacturers offer upgrades because they increase the\nworking lifetimes of products and can be a significant source of revenue. Original\nequipment manufacturers have a competitive advantage in this business because\nthey normally have records of where equipment has been sold which could benefit\nfrom upgrading (Kneckt et al, 1993).\nOver the last fifteen years there has been a change in the scope of support and in the\nrecognition of its importance. In the early 1980s, when many products had high failure\nrates, the most important aspect of support was fast and reliable repair (Lele and\nKarmarker, 1983). New technologies have led typically to more reliable but more\ncomplex products, often with many software-based functions. Consequently, the scope\nof support has broadened and now includes a greater emphasis on elements such as\n9user training and on-line support (Goffin, 1998). This change in scope is reflected in\nthe greater use of the term customer support, as opposed to customer service which\nwas commonly used in the past (Clark, 1988). As the importance of customer support\nhas become more widely recognized, companies are now taking a more professional\napproach to it than they did previously (Kneckt et al, 1993).\nThere are two aspects of customer support, which particularly deserve\nmanagement attention. Firstly, there is the need for customer support requirements to\nbe fully considered at the design stage (Lele, 1986)\u2014using what are called Design for\nSupportability techniques (Goffin, 1998)\u2014in order to develop products which are\neconomical and easy to support. Secondly, the logistics of delivering customer support\nthrough suitable channels is key. Companies which are good at both of these aspects\nhave differentiated themselves from their competitors and won significant market\nshare [see for example (Goffin, 1994)].\nDistribution Channels\nIf customers are to be provided with good product support, companies need to select\nand effectively manage their distribution channels. Manufacturing companies may\nhave their own\u2014direct\u2014organization for customer support, or they may use\nalternatives. A review of the trade and popular management press confirmed the\nimportance of good distribution channels [see for example (Blumberg, 1989;\nBlumberg, 1994; Cagan, 1994; Fites, 1996; Gasparovic, 1989; or Renn, 1990)].\nDespite this importance, there has only been sparse attention to this area from\nresearchers. Table I summarizes the salient points from the only four pieces of\nprevious research which have collected empirical data on customer support\ndistribution channels. Even these four papers provide only sketchy information.\n10\nLittle et al (1988) surveyed a sample of high-technology companies\u2019 practices\nin spare parts management. Although the importance of the organization used for\ncustomer support is acknowledged, the influence of different distribution channels is\nnot considered.\nArmistead and Clark\u2019s book (1992) is based on the results of survey research.\nIt noted that more complex products usually require more support and therefore\nmanufacturers will normally want to exert maximum control over customer support by\nhaving their own direct customer support organization. Armistead and Clark also\nidentify the limitations of particular distribution channels, for example the high costs\nof a direct customer support channel and the lower degree of control resulting from\nindirect channels, such as dealers.\nTake in Table I\nHull and Cox (1994) studied the role of customer support in six US companies\nin the electronics and computing sectors. Since all six companies used the direct\nchannel, this study provided no information on the role of different channels in\ncustomer support. However, it provided six examples of the successful use of a direct\nchannel and demonstrated the importance of good information exchange and parts\nmanagement.\nIn a study focusing solely on support distribution channels, Loomba (1996)\nstated that there are five main channels:\n1) Direct support from the factory\n2) A direct after-sales network\n3) Channel intermediaries\n11\n4) Authorized, independent third parties\n5) Some combination of the above possibilities\nUsing case study technique at two US computer companies Loomba showed that the\nchoice of customer support distribution channel is closely linked to a company\u2019s sales\nchannel. The limitation of this study is that it only investigated two companies, both\nof which are in the computer industry.\nThe review of the literature indicated the need for a wider investigation of\ncustomer support, covering sectors other than computing and electronics.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe current study investigated the distribution channels used for customer support by\ncompanies in five different industries. To conduct this exploratory research, case study\nmethodology was chosen as an appropriate approach and the research was designed in\nthree main stages:\n1) Preliminary contact. Leading companies in various industries were contacted by\nletter and to obtain their agreement to participate in the research. At this point\ntelephone calls were made to the customer support managers to understand the\ndistribution channels used and identify the most suitable informants at each\ncompany.\n2) Case study visits. One-day visits were made to the companies to conduct semi-\nstructured interviews with the customer support manager and other informants,\nsuch as marketing and quality managers. During these visits the researcher also had\nthe opportunity to see companies\u2019 products; either on a factory tour or a visit to a\ncompany\u2019s product showroom.\n12\n3) Data analysis and post-visit contact. After each visit, data analysis and reduction\nwas conducted and, following the completion of all five visits, cross-case analysis\nwas performed. There was also a high degree of involvement of the participating\ncompanies during this stage, in checking the data and discussing the results with\nthe researcher.\nCase Study Visits\nThe main data collection was performed during visits to the companies. These were\nmade over a period of seven months in 1997-98. During each visit, semi-structured\ninterviews were held with a range of informants. Holding on-site interviews at\ncompanies with personnel from various departments\u2014typically customer support,\nmarketing, quality, and development\u2014allowed a comprehensive picture of the role of\ncustomer support within the company to be obtained.\nThe interviews at each company were based on a questionnaire designed to collect\ninformation related to each of the following research questions:\n1) What are the characteristics of typical products?\n2) What is the role and importance of customer support in the market?\n3) What are the key elements of customer support?\n4) Which distribution channel(s) is (are) used for customer support and what are the\nassociated advantages and limitations?\nThe 11-page questionnaire was based on the instruments developed by\nresearchers who have previously investigated customer support; primarily the work of\nKnecht et al (1993); Hull and Cox (1994); Loomba (1996); and the author (Goffin,\n1990). [The questionnaire also covered a number of additional issues which have\n13\nbeen reported elsewhere (Goffin and New, 1998). Copies of the questionnaire are\navailable from the author.]\nInterviews were recorded (and later transcribed) and at the same time detailed\nnotes were taken. Interview transcripts were prepared and footnotes added to explain\nany specific terms used by the respondents. In addition to direct discussions, a number\nof telephone interviews were held with personnel who were not available during the\non-site visits but interviewees had recommended the researcher to contact.\nA number of company documents were also inspected during the visits. These\nincluded company brochures and annual reports (for background information);\nproduct brochures (to understand product features and to see whether customer\nsupport was used as a marketing tool); financial statements (to investigate support\nrevenues); and organization charts (to see where customer support fitted in the overall\ncompany organization). Companies were willing to give the researcher copies of most\nof these documents but, in the case of financial statements and (sometimes)\norganization charts, they only allowed inspection. After each visit a detailed case file\nwas prepared containing the transcripts, interview notes and copies of documents.\nSample\nFive industries were selected as an exploratory sample for the research. As the\ncomputer industry has been the focus of most previous research (see Table I), other\nsectors were chosen. Telecommunications, the car industry, vending machines, aircraft\nand domestic appliances were chosen\u2014a purposive choice of industries. The choice\nwas driven by the need to cover a variety of case study contexts. Therefore both a\ndeliberately wide range of sectors (including both consumer and business-to-business\nproducts) and technologies (from electronics to mechanical devices) were included.\n14\nOnce the industries had been chosen, \u201cleading\u201d companies were identified\u2014\ncompanies having a significant market share in their industry. All of the sample\ncompanies have operations in Europe.\nAs a motivation to participate in the research, companies were promised,\nanonymity and an informal \u201cbenchmarking report\u201d, contrasting their approach to\ncustomer support to that of the other companies. This offer was well received and only\none company declined to cooperate with the research (forcing the selection of another\ncompany). The companies were also invited to a one-day workshop where the results\nof the research were presented and each company had a chance to discuss customer\nsupport issues with the other companies, which participated.\nData Analysis\nCase analysis involved three main stages.\n\uf0b7 Each case was reviewed separately and the data analyzed to give a complete picture\nof the company\u2019s approach to evaluating support at the design stage. To check the\ninternal validity of the data, triangulation was used; between different respondents\nand between respondents\u2019 comments and copies of company documentation.\n\uf0b7 Data reduction was performed and 2-3 page case descriptions were written on each\ncompany. A number of main headings were used for data presentation including:\nProduct Characteristics; Key Elements of Customer Support; Importance of\nCustomer Support; and Support Delivery Channel. The descriptions were then\nsubmitted to informants for two reasons. Firstly, informants checked that the case\ndescriptions did not contain obvious clues to their company\u2019s identity or\ninformation that was likely to compromise their business. Secondly, informants\n15\nchecked the detail given in the case description\u2014and a number of small corrections\nwere made.\n\uf0b7 Following this, cross-case comparisons were made, to determine where similarities\nand differences existed and to identify a number of \u201cbest practices\u201d (Yin, 1994). As\nthe results of the cross-case analysis were presented to participating companies\nduring the workshop mentioned above, this allowed the conclusions to be discussed\nwith the informants.\nRESULTS: FIVE CASE STUDIES\nThe data from each company will be described separately, before a cross-case analysis\nis given. As the companies were promised anonymity, they will be referred to as\nTelecommA, AutoB, VendorC, AircoD and DomesticE. Table II summarizes company\nbackgrounds and key findings. Data from each case has been collated under the same\nfour headings, to make comparisons easier.\nTake in Table II\nCase 1: TelecommA\nTelecommA is a leading European company in the field of telecommunications\nequipment which designs, integrates and supports complex systems used in logistics\napplications, such as radio contact and control of fleets of vehicles.\n\uf0b7 Product Characteristics. Each system sold has a unique configuration of devices\nsuch as PCs, sensing and radio equipment, with specialized software monitoring\nand controlling the resulting network. Systems are sold for approximately $1M and\n16\ncustomers\u2014normally large companies or organizations\u2014use them for up to 20\nyears before replacement.\n\uf0b7 Key Elements of Customer Support. Systems are complex and are installed by\nTelecommA engineers with a typical installation taking 9 working days. Users\nrequire training and this takes one day following installation. Once the equipment\nis in use, TelecommA \u201cspend very little time on training, we do try to pass that on\nto the customer. We might train the trainers, if anything. We often try to do that\nduring installation\u201d [TelecommA\u2014Development Manager]. All systems are sold\nwith a 12 months hardware warranty and 3 months software warranty, which is\nstandard in this industry. Hardware is very reliable and failure rates are typically\nonly 1%. System documentation is produced by R&D engineers and has, in the\npast, been written mainly for internal use. However, some customers are now\nrequesting comprehensive documentation for their own use in first-line\nmaintenance. Upgrades, which enhance system capability, are a significant\nbusiness for TelecommA and systems typically have a major upgrade every 2 years.\n\uf0b7 Importance of Customer Support. Support is \u201cbecoming more and more important,\nparticularly to... non-technical owners of systems\u201d [Development Manager]. This is\nbecause customers cannot afford their systems to be out of order and therefore,\nTelecommA offer a quick response in the event of problems. From a business\nperspective, support is important because of its influence on customer satisfaction.\nHowever, it also generates about 4 percent of revenues (at margins of typically 60\npercent).\n\uf0b7 Support Delivery Channel. TelecommA have no formal field support organization.\nTherefore, the Operations Manager utilizing R&D engineers organizes installation,\nhardware and software maintenance, and upgrades. It is acknowledged that this can\n17\nlead to resources being stretched: \u201cit\u2019s a balancing act\u201d [Operations Manager] but\nexisting customers have, if need be, the priority over development work. As a\nconsequence, TelecommA think they have \u201cbuilt up a reputation [for good support]\nvery quickly by going in and only sending people who were able to fix the\nproblems\u201d [Quality Manager], compared to competitors who have a dedicated field\norganization but are less effective at system problem-solving.\nTelecommA are now looking to improve their customer support offering and gain a\ncompetitive advantage from it because currently \u201cwe don\u2019t sell our support well\nenough\u201d [Operations Manager].\nCase 2: AutoB\nThis company is a major international car manufacturer. They design, market,\nmanufacture and (indirectly) service cars and their products are produced in very high\nvolumes.\n\uf0b7 Product Characteristics. Typical vehicles cost $15,000 and are sold both to private\nusers and fleets\u2014the latter is a major segment of the business. Car design is\nchanging fast and typical models now include a large amount of new technology in\nengine management, airbag control, etc. A passenger car has a 10-12 year working\nlifetime, during which it will have a number of owners.\n\uf0b7 Key Elements of Customer Support. In the automotive industry product support is\ngenerally referred to as service and the most important elements are warranty;\nmaintenance and repair including parts; documentation (workshop and owner\nmanuals); and training mechanics. Warranty is normally 12 months, although\ncompetitive pressure is changing this to 3 years in some countries. Due to the\nnumber of different mechanical parts, cars require a significant amount of\n18\nmaintenance and repair, which increases cost-of-ownership. Stocking and\ndistributing spare parts is a major part of the business for AutoB and other car\ncompanies. Although accessories\u2014such as mud-flaps and roof racks\u2014may be sold\nafter the initial sale, currently the automotive industry does not have an upgrade\nbusiness as such.\n\uf0b7 Importance of Customer Support. Car cost-of-ownership is a key factor,\nparticularly for fleet sales. Fleet managers are very much aware of running costs, as\nthese are published per model in the trade journals. Therefore \u201creducing cost-of-\nownership sells cars\u201d [Advanced Service Manager]. Internally, support is viewed as\nan important area; parts generate about 15% of revenues and 24% of profits.\n\uf0b7 Support Delivery Channel. AutoB have a large organization responsible for\nmanaging spare parts, as it is a major part of their business. Actual maintenance for\nall of their products is however provided through an accredited chain of dealers all\nof whom must provide sales, service and parts management. To ensure that\ncustomers receive a good quality service, dealers\u2019 car mechanics must attend\nAutoB\u2019s maintenance and repair training courses\u2014there are three levels of training\nand dealers must have a minimum number of staff trained to each level. AutoB\n\u201cpublish labor times and the dealers are required to work to those\u201d [Advanced\nService Manager]. As the service delivery channel is not directly under the control\nof AutoB, they experience difficulty in obtaining comprehensive and accurate data\non reliability and repairs over the typical working lifetime of a car.\nAutoB believe that they must further reduce the cost-of-ownership of their products\nand are looking closely at their competitors\u2019 work in this area.\n19\nCase 3: VendorC\nThis company designs, manufactures, sells and supports complex vending machines.\nVending companies buy large numbers of machines to provide self-service sales of a\nwide range of goods, some of which are of high value.\n\uf0b7 Product Characteristics. Modern vending machines\u2014often referred to as Vending\nTerminals\u2014are a complex mix of mechanical, electronic, security and display\ntechnologies and a top range model can cost in the region of $15,000. The product\nworking lifetime is about 10 years. Due to the relatively large number of\nmechanical components in vending machines and their high levels of usage, regular\nmaintenance and repair is required. Vendor terminals can now be linked via\nmodems to a central computer, which remotely monitors performance, sales\nactivity and stock levels in chains of vending machines.\n\uf0b7 Key Elements of Customer Support. VendorC offer a total installation service and\n\u201cmanage all aspects of installation, from site surveying, architectural design and\nplanning, to building, wiring and fitting\u201d [Quality Manager]. Warranties are 90\ndays\u2014standard in this industry. Timely maintenance and repair is very important as\nequipment downtime leads to lost sales. Terminals have full technical\ndocumentation for maintenance purposes and some of this is being made available\nover the Internet. Training plays a key role, as the staff at vending companies who\nare responsible for first-line maintenance and replenishment of machines require\ninstruction. Using the modem links already mentioned, VendorC have the\ncapability to offer full goods management to their customers i.e. both ensuring that\nmachines are efficiently maintained and replenished with sales goods in a timely\nfashion. This incremental service is an important source of revenue. VendorC also\n20\nsell upgrades; they \u201cwill carefully examine the benefits of refurbishing... used\nterminals to extend equipment lifetime\u201d [VendorC brochure].\n\uf0b7 Importance of Customer Support. Product support generates 35% of VendorC\u2019s\nsales at margins of typically 25%. These revenues are increasing as, although the\nnew products are more reliable and require less service, \u201cgoods management\u201d\ncreates new business opportunities. Top management at VendorC has focused more\nresources on product support over the last decade due to the recognition that good\nsupport can \u201cdramatically improve... [customers\u2019] business performance\u201d [Quality\nManager].\n\uf0b7 Support Delivery Channel. VendorC have a large field organization and 70% of all\nservice-related activities world-wide are conducted by them directly\u2014the balance,\nparticularly in certain countries, being managed via third party maintenance\ncompanies. Some of VendorC\u2019s larger customers use their own staff to carry out\nsimple maintenance procedures. The performance of both the field organization\nand the installed base of vending machines is very closely monitored by an\nelaborate internet-based system which collates data on all aspects of field service.\nProduct reliability (e.g. downtime by product; by location; by cause; etc.) and\nservice engineer efficiency (installation times; percentage first-time-fixes; etc.) are\njust two of the metrics which are reported daily by the field organization. Over 18\nmonths work was required to create this system but \u201cI want to point out that a huge\nstep forward was getting data that was just about instantaneous\u201d [Product Support\nManager]. Comprehensive data has been found crucial for early recognition of\nproduct problems and in \u201ccharging customers where their misuse \/ abuse led to\nservice costs\u201d [Product Support Manager]. \u201cQuality Assurance have [subsequently]\n21\nworked in partnership with several key customers to perform an overall analysis of\ntheir \u2018system\u2019 availability\u201d [Quality Assurance Engineer].\nVendorC\u2019s strong focus on customer support has enabled them to use it to gain a\nsignificant competitive advantage from their unique combination of reliable, highly-\nfunctional products and a responsive field organization offering a wide range of\nincremental services.\nCase 4: AircoD\nThis company designs, manufactures and sells small passenger aircraft\u2014termed\nregional aircraft in the industry. Regional aircraft is a very competitive industry and is\nhighly regulated by a number of authorities such as the Federal Aviation\nAdministration in the USA.\n\uf0b7 Product Characteristics. The aircraft typically cost between $6M and $12M,\ndepending on the size and configuration. Individual aircraft have a working lifetime\nof at least 20 years. Airlines may require customized products and request, for\nexample, particular types of electronics (avionics) or \u201cmid life updates\u201d.\n\uf0b7 Key Elements of Customer Support. Aircraft flight safety and reliability is\nparamount. AircoD deliver aircraft to their customers with comprehensive warranty\ncover, which is generally specified in cycles (e.g. the number of take-offs and\nlandings). The warranty is specified separately for each major component of the\naircraft, for instance engines. Depending on the level of usage, significant amounts\nof maintenance are required\u2014approximately 3 maintenance hours per flying hour\nis typical in the industry. As might be expected in a highly regulated industry, high-\nquality documentation must accompany aircraft including the Flight Manual,\nwhich contains all the information for the pilot; the Manufacturer\u2019s Operating\n22\nManual (MOMs) which specifies all safety procedures; and maintenance manuals.\nTraining of airline personnel is a significant support element. AircoD runs\ninduction and refresher courses for pilots and maintenance engineers on a regular\nbasis. Spare parts are sold to airlines by AircoD but alternative sources exist and so\nthis means that AircoD only \u201cget patchy spares revenues, particularly on second\nhand aircraft\u201d [Customer Service Manager]. On the other hand upgrading aircraft is\na significant business and they \u201cmake substantial revenue from enhancements\u201d\n[Customer Service Manager]. A key aspect of AircoD\u2019s strategy is their\nEngineering Support\u2014advice to airlines on how best to manage their aircraft. This\nis done continually, by examining the trends in customers\u2019 monthly returns of flight\ndelays and cancellation figures; comparing them against figures from similar\noperators; and giving advice on how to improve them. Engineering support is\nprovided without charge to major customers and helps them improve aircraft\nreliability and prevent canceled flights (which otherwise lead to loss of revenues\nfor airlines).\n\uf0b7 Importance of Customer Support. In the aircraft industry, including the regional\nsector, it is crucial to offer good customer support. Support is the source of\napproximately 20% of revenues as \u201cspares revenues and the ground skills\n[maintenance courses] revenues are really the main streams of our income after\nsales\u201d [Customer Service Manager]. Each aircraft sold generates about $300K\nservice revenues per year initially. Typically, however, AircoD earn less revenue\nfrom older aircraft, particularly second hand ones, where alternative sources for\nspare parts may be used. Overall, support contributes approximately 15% of profits.\n\uf0b7 Support Delivery Channel. Regional airlines employ their own maintenance\nengineers and they conduct 95% of maintenance and repair work. Aviation\n23\nregulations require that these engineers be licensed and have received training from\nthe manufacturer. In addition AircoD has a product support organization at the\nfactory. This can provide aircraft maintenance and repair. However, the more\nimportant function of the factory-based support organization is to provide\nengineering support to regional airlines and cater for international customers with\nwidely varying degrees of experience\u2014from those who are almost self-sufficient to\nthose who require daily interface to the manufacturer.\nAircoD\u2019s focus on after-sales service has enabled them to build a reputation in the\nbusiness and they intend to further capitalize on this.\nCase 5: DomesticE\nThis company designs, manufactures, sells and repairs domestic appliances, such as\nwashing machines. They operate in a highly competitive, price-sensitive market\u2014\nshown by the fact that despite having a strong brand, DomesticE have been unable to\nincrease their prices for the last ten years.\n\uf0b7 Product Characteristics. Modern washing machines are a mix of mechanical,\nelectro-mechanical and, increasingly, electronic components and a typical model\nhas a factory cost in the region of $300. Washing machines have a working lifetime\nof about 10 years in normal usage. Due to the number of mechanical components\nthey contain, washing machines are susceptible to failure\u2014the industry average\nfailure rate is 25% for a machine in its first year of usage.\n\uf0b7 Key Elements of Customer Support. In the majority of cases, customers themselves\ninstall washing machines, or independently arrange for installation to be carried out\nby a local tradesman. Warranties of one year are the norm in the industry but\nDomesticE sometimes competes on warranty by offering the customer better terms.\n24\nWashing machines used to need preventive maintenance, however, maintenance\nhas now been \u201cengineered out of products by designing them for the whole life\ncycle\u201d [Process Manager] and service engineers are not required unless a product\nfails. Timely response to failures is essential in this market and DomesticE have\ntheir own, long-established and extensive service organization. Simple and\neffective user documentation is important because customers seldom have much\ntechnical knowledge. DomesticE have recognized this and try to produce user\ndocumentation (covering installation, operation and simple fault-finding) which is\nwritten in a style that is accessible to typical users.\n\uf0b7 Importance of Customer Support. Strong product service is recognized by\nDomesticE\u2019s management as one of their competitive advantages and is strongly\npromoted; \u201cour extensive After-Sales Service ensures each product produces a\nmarket-leading performance from day one onwards\u201d [extract from a promotional\nbrochure]. Currently product service generates significant revenues at margins that\nare typically significantly higher than profits from product sales. DomesticE\u2019s\ncompetitors have, in the main, not gained a reputation for the quality of their after-\nsales service.\n\uf0b7 Support Delivery Channel. DomesticE\u2019s own field service organization responds\nquickly and repairs machines on-site. The organization \u201cis a major strength and\nstrongly influences customers to purchase our products\u201d [Process Manager]. In\ncontrast, one competitor has subcontracted all their repair work to a third party but\nhas failed to build up a good reputation for service. A significant amount of all\nservice-related activities are conducted by DomesticE\u2019s service organization; local\ntradesmen taking the balance of the repair work. DomesticE\u2019s high share of the\ntotal service business is the result of their successful marketing of support and an\n25\nefficient channel to deliver it. The performance of the service organization is\nclosely monitored, including monthly reporting of the number of customer\nproblems which can be fixed on the first visit (a high but confidential figure). In\naddition, DomesticE also collect comprehensive data on product performance from\ntheir service organization and this enables analysis of failure modes. This\ninformation is then fed back to the design team working on product enhancements.\nDomesticE\u2019s focus on customer service has helped them achieve and successfully\ndefend their strong market position. However, they now face the challenge of needing\nto improve product reliability within the restrictions of a price-sensitive market.\nCROSS-CASE ANALYSIS\nAs explained earlier, a deliberately wide range of industries was covered. It is\ninteresting to note that, despite their very different market characteristics, customer\nsupport plays an important role in each of them.\nThe Importance of Customer Support\nAll of the sample companies acknowledged the importance of customer support to\ntheir businesses and their customers. For companies, customer support is an important\nsource of revenue (from between 4% and 35% of total revenues) with very high\nmargins\u2014often much higher than the profit margins on product sales. This result\nempirically confirms the views of Knecht et al (1993) on the magnitude of typical\nsupport revenues.\nAt all five companies, customer support was perceived by managers to be an\nessential part of their \u201coffer\u201d to customers. This was equally true for all the range of\nproducts; from $300 washing machines to $12 million aircraft. Although the measure\n26\nused (managers\u2019 perceptions) is an indirect indication of actual customers\u2019 opinions,\nthe results do show that support is extremely important to customers in a range of\nindustries.\nA major implication of these findings is that researchers have not given\ncustomer support the level of attention, which reflects its importance as both a source\nof revenue and in achieving customer satisfaction. This view is further reinforced by\ncases such as VendorC, where customer support has expanded and new services have\nbecome more profitable than sales of new products. As recognized by previous\nresearch, \u201calthough field service has been noted as a competitive edge, information on\nthe subject... is lacking\u201d (Hull and Cox, 1994).\nKey Elements of Customer Support\nIt should be noted that discussions with the respondents established which elements\nwere important in each company\u2019s market. For the elements chosen as important, no\nfurther attempt was made to determine relative priority ratings. This was because each\nof the respondents stressed that they must offer good support across all of the elements\nseen as essential in their market (a complete \u201ccustomer support package\u201d).\nKnecht et al (1993) recognized that product characteristics\u2014such as cost and\nreliability\u2014have a strong influence over the potential for customer support revenues.\nHowever, they did not identify that the elements of support that are relevant to a\nparticular business can vary significantly. The current five case studies show this\nstrongly; row five of Table II indicates which of the main seven elements of customer\nsupport identified in the literature are key to each of the companies. For AutoB, only\nfour elements are key, whereas for VendorC and AircoD nearly every element is\nimportant and needs careful management. In addition, the latter two companies offer\n27\nincremental services (goods management and engineering support respectively) which\ncould both be classified as additional aspects of support.\nThree key elements are common across all markets: documentation, warranty\nand fast response. Customers in all five markets expect reliable products and, in the\nevent of equipment failure, fast response and financial cover.\nWhat determines which elements of support are key in a particular market?\nTechnology and equipment designs obviously have a large influence over the key\nelements of product support. In the companies where products have a large number of\nmechanical components (AutoB, VendorC and AircoD), products require higher\nlevels of maintenance. In contrast, in the telecommunications industry (TelecommA)\nhardware maintenance is less of an issue but software support is crucial. Between\nthese two extremes, DomesticE have eliminated maintenance but still have significant\nnumbers of failures and, consequently, repairs.\nEquipment retrofits or upgrades are an important element of customer support\nin three industries; telecommunications, vending machines and aircraft (AircoD).\nCurrently they are not important in the car industry (AutoB) but this may change. For\nexample as more electronics\u2014a technology that lends itself to comparatively easy\nupgrades\u2014are used in cars. Equipment design also determines largely the amount of\nuser training required, as has been previously noted (Goffin, 1998).\nFrom the results, it appears that different types of products and different\ncustomers require different patterns of support. All of the elements of support which\nare essential to customers in a particular market need to be provided by companies as\npart of their high-quality customer support \u201coffer\u201d.\n28\nDistribution Channels\nFive different distribution channels can be identified from the sample; as shown by\nTable III. All five companies provide some support direct from their factory.\nHowever, the type of support provided direct from the factory should be noted. Only\nin the case of TelecommA is all customer support from the factory, using R&D\nengineers. In all other cases separate channels provide actual field support for the\ncustomer (e.g. on-site maintenance), whereas the in-factory organization acts as an\ninterface between the distribution channel and the factory. For instance, AircoD\u2019s\nmain field support channel is through airlines\u2019 maintenance engineers whereas the\nfactory-based organization offers training and engineering support. AutoB and\nVendorC both have large factory-based groups\u2014called technical marketing\u2014which\nare deeply involved in product development, ensuring that customer support issues are\nconsidered at the design stage. DomesticE also has a small factory-based organization,\nwhich is responsible for spare parts management.\nTake in Table III\nTwo companies (VendorC and DomesticE) have their own highly-trained field\nsupport organizations, which conduct most of their support. However, both of these\ncompanies also use approved dealers in countries where they do not have their own\norganizations. AutoB also use dealers, but in their case this is their sole channel for\nsupport\u2014an extensive chain of authorized dealers responsible for both sales and\nsupport of AutoB cars.\nFor certain support tasks, such as maintenance, customers may want to use\ntheir own personnel. Three of the case companies enable trained engineers from\n29\ncustomers to conduct support. This approach can lead to reduced costs and, in some\ncircumstances can lead to a competitive advantage for companies which provide the\nmeans for this [for an example see (Goffin 1994)].\nComparisons to Loomba\u2019s Research\nAs it is the most detailed piece of previous research, Loomba\u2019s work deserves mention\nand his findings and propositions require discussion.\nLoomba\u2019s first proposition (P1), based on his two cases, was that customer\nsupport distribution channels are closely linked to sales channels and, for example,\nmanufacturers with their own (direct) sales organizations will opt to establish their\nown (direct) support organizations. By implication, companies with indirect sales\nchannels (e.g. companies selling to customers through dealers or retail chains) will opt\nfor indirect support channels. The five cases in this current study, however, do not\nprovide unequivocal evidence for this. Table IV shows that TelecommA, AutoB and\nVendorC have identical channels for sales and support (for AutoB the channel is\ndealers; for the other two it is direct). However, AircoD and DomesticE do not have\nthe same channels for their support as their sales. Although it appears logical that\ncompanies would normally use the same type of channel for sales and support, a\nbroader investigation is required before conclusions on this can be reached.\nTake in Table IV\nLoomba\u2019s propositions (P2 and P3) on the influence of the type of product on\nsupport channels require inspection. It was expected that manufacturers of\n\u201ccommodity\u201d products would choose indirect support channels whereas manufacturers\n30\nof \u201cspecialty\u201d products would choose direct channels. Once again, three of the case\nstudies fit with these propositions but two do not\u2014as shown by Table IV.\nTelecommA produces highly customized systems and does have a direct channel.\nAutoB has more standard products and an indirect channel. VendorC has complex\nproducts, which are often customized and has a direct channel. Therefore the first\nthree cases do support propositions P2 and P3. However, AircoD has highly\ncustomized products but has an indirect channel. Similarly, DomesticE has\ncommodity products and a direct channel.\nIn order to fully \u201ctest\u201d Loomba\u2019s propositions, survey or similar methodology\nwould need to be used and obviously this was not the case with the current study.\nHowever, in order to increase the knowledge on distribution channels it is still\nvaluable to compare the current results with the previous propositions. Since the\ncomparisons show equivocal results, it appears that the choice of the support channel\nis dependent on more complex factors than originally proposed by Loomba. From the\ncurrent study, it is clear that the choice of customer support distribution channel is\nalso influenced by:\n\uf0b7 Companies\u2019 desire to earn support revenues directly\n\uf0b7 The required degree of control over the quality of customer support\n\uf0b7 The high costs of creating direct distribution channels (especially in remote\ngeographical locations)\nA more detailed investigation, with a wider sample, is necessary on these points.\nCustomer Support Strategies\nIn addition to providing information on distribution channels, the case studies\nprovided an insight into all aspects of how companies manage customer support. All\n31\nof the sample companies have used their expertise in customer support to gain a\ncompetitive advantage. Therefore, the data collected were also analyzed to determine\nwhich factors influence companies\u2019 customer support strategies. From this cross-case\nanalysis, it appears that there are at least four important components to customer\nsupport strategies:\n\uf0b7 Identifying Customers\u2019 Support Requirements. Understanding the customer\u2019s need\nfor support is an intuitively obvious aspect of deriving a support strategy. However,\nit could well be that many companies neglect this. Most of the case study\ncompanies said that they actively conduct market research into customers\u2019 support\nrequirements and to identify new business opportunities. One respondent\nsummarized this as: \u201cthe whole accent on support as far as we are concerned is\ngetting to know your customer and helping them get the best out of our product. To\nensure this we [the manufacturer] can offer to examine the customer\u2019s operation\nand provide advice on how he can get the best from the product. This can be\ntechnical, operational or commercial advice\u201d [AircoD Customer Service Manager].\n\uf0b7 Design for Supportability. Since product design strongly influences how easy it is\nto support products, it is essential to consider customer support at the design stage.\nSome of the sample companies (AutoB, VendorC and AircoD) concentrate\nsignificant resources on this and have been successful at improving the\nsupportability of their products. The ways that the sample companies manage\nDesign for Supportability is covered in detail in a separate paper (Goffin and New,\n1998).\n\uf0b7 Choosing \/ Managing Distribution Channels. The distribution channel used for\nsupport can have a strong influence on the quality of support received (and\nperceived) by the customer. Therefore, the choice of the channel is an important\n32\none and sometimes the high costs of a direct channel are more than offset by the\nrevenues it generates and the competitive advantage it creates (e.g. DomesticE).\nOnce a channel or channels have been chosen, companies face the challenge of\nensuring that all customers receive good support. This requires good logistics; for\nexample in the management of spare parts and ensuring that customer support\nengineers are quickly available to conduct maintenance and repairs. Companies\nalso need to invest in systems for monitoring the performance of their customer\nsupport organizations (as shown by VendorC and DomesticE).\n\uf0b7 Promoting Support for Competitive Advantage. Inspection of company and product\nbrochures from the sample companies showed that they all promote the quality of\ntheir support to their customers to some degree. However, customer support needs\nto be skillfully marketed and one respondent company (TelecommA) stated they\nneeded to improve in this area. Customer support managers at all five of the sample\ncompanies had a detailed knowledge of their competitors\u2019 support channels and\nofferings and used this information in developing their own strategies.\nCustomer support strategy needs to be researched further and best practices need to be\nidentified\u2014because this information would be very relevant to practitioners.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe contribution of this research is that it provides valuable empirical evidence on the\nimportance of customer support in different industries, both in terms of the revenue\nthat support generates and the role it plays in achieving customer satisfaction. By\ninvestigating vastly different industries, the research also demonstrates for the first\ntime that customer support is important in sectors other than computing. In addition,\n33\nthe case studies illustrate the different distribution channels that can be used for\ncustomer support.\nAs the sample was small, the question of whether the results can be\ngeneralized to other companies or industries arises. However, case studies are seldom\nrepresentative of a population and the results from such studies should be \u201cgeneralized\nto theory\u201d (Yin, 1994). From the current research, it is possible to theorize on four\nmain points:\n\uf0b7 Customer support appears to be important in industries where equipment is\ncomplex (and therefore difficult to install, or learn to use); where breakdowns\noccur relatively frequently, or have serious financial or other consequences for the\nowner; and where cost-of-ownership is significant.\n\uf0b7 The nature of the product and market characteristics (such as user skill levels)\nlargely determines the key elements of customer support.\n\uf0b7 There are five main choices for customer support distribution channels and\ncompanies need to determine the best combination to meet their needs and\ncustomers\u2019 requirements.\n\uf0b7 Companies need to consider four main issues in determining a customer support\nstrategy, which will give them competitive advantage.\nAs clearly demonstrated in this article, research into customer support is\nlacking and there many areas that require further investigation. The main priority is for\na wide survey of companies in different industries, to determine how important\nsupport is in further sectors. In the five industries covered by the current study, further\ndata is needed to show whether all companies in these sectors perceive support as\nimportant as the sample companies (which are leaders with significant market shares).\n34\nThis type of investigation should also look at whether there is a relationship between a\nstrong focus on customer support and higher market share. The case of VendorC\nclearly demonstrates that significant competitive advantage can be obtained from\nincremental services. This requires further investigation\u2014are a high percentage of\nmanufacturing companies offering incremental services? Another priority is for\nresearch into customer support strategy and whether the four components of strategy\nidentified in the previous section are relevant to other companies.\nThe current research, although it was exploratory, still has important\nimplications for managers in all sectors where customer support plays a role.\nManagers at all five sample companies state that they have gained a significant\ncompetitive advantage through providing high-quality customer support. Since this\nmessage comes from market leaders, then it is certainly that other companies should\ntake very seriously.\n35\nREFERENCES\n[1] Anonymous (1997), \u201cAircraft Manuals Often Ambiguous\u201d, The Independent, Monday\n3rd February, p4.\n[2] Armistead, C.G. and Clark, G (1992), Customer Service and Support, Pitman, London.\n[3] Athaide, G.A., Meyers, P.W. and Wilemon, D.L.
