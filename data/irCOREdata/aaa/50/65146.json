Sickness benefit reform and the politics of (ill) health.  \n \n \nArticle length: 4176 words \n \n \n \n \nABSTRACT \nIncome maintenance during unemployment, old age or long-term sickness is a key facet of \nwelfare provision and an important mediatory factor in the relationship between socio-\neconomic position and health status. Since October 2008, the main long-term sickness \nabsence benefit in the UK (Incapacity Benefit) has been replaced with \u201eEmployment Support \nAllowance\u201f.  Despite the importance of income maintenance for health and health inequalities, \nthis change has been largely ignored within public health circles. After outlining these reforms \nand providing a historical policy context, this article utilises welfare reform theory and \nempirical literature to argue that these changes represent a broader international \ntransformation from welfare to workfare states, the re-emergence of labour discipline, and a \npolitical shift in how people suffering from ill health are categorised as disabled or not and \nperceived as \u201edeserving\u201f or \u201eundeserving\u201f of state support. Finally, the case is made for the \nneed to develop a new critical public health research and practice agenda around \nworklessness. \n \n158 words \n 2 \nINTRODUCTION \n\u2018If you think that living on welfare is all sugar, cherries and honey, you\u2019re wrong, \nbecause there is too much month left at the end of the money\u2019 \nWelfare Rights Campaigner 1970s USA. \n \nIncome maintenance during unemployment, old age or long term sickness is the key facet of \nwelfare provision and an important mediatory factor in the relationship between socio-\neconomic position and health status (Eikemo and Bambra, 2008). Since October 2008, the \nmain long term sickness absence benefit in the UK (Incapacity Benefit) has been replaced by \nan \u201eEmployment Support Allowance\u201f (ESA) (DWP, 2006; HMSO, 2006) (see Box 1). This \nchange has been largely ignored within public health circles, despite the importance of \nincome maintenance policies for health and health inequalities. This article outlines and \ncontextualises these reforms, and utilises welfare reform theory and evidence to argue that \nthey reflect a broader international transformation from welfare to workfare states, represent a \nre-emergence of labour discipline, and signify a political shift in how people suffering from ill \nhealth are defined as disabled or not, and perceived as \u201edeserving\u201f or \u201eundeserving\u201f of state \nsupport. Finally, the need for engagement by the wider public health community is \nemphasised and the article begins to outline what a critical public health research and \npractice agenda focusing upon ill health related worklessness might look like. \n \n \nUK HISTORICAL POLICY CONTEXT \nHistorically in the UK (and elsewhere), disability and chronic illness are associated with \npoverty and social exclusion (Acheson et al, 1998; Bartley and Lewis, 2002; Oliver and \nBarnes, 1998). This is largely because work is one of the main sources of income in the UK \nand people with disabilities and chronic illnesses have disproportionately low employment \nrates. Since 1945, government action in terms of changing this situation can be categorised \ninto three distinct phases: passive welfarism, active welfarism and what this paper suggests is \na move towards \u201eworkfare\u201f (Box 2).  \n 3 \n  \nBox 1: Sickness absence benefits in the UK   \nSince October 2008, Incapacity Benefit (IB) will be replaced, for new but not existing \nclaimants, by the \u201eEmployment Support Allowance\u201f (DWP, 2006; HMSO, 2006). \n \nIB is the main non-means tested social security cash benefit, paid to 2.7 million people in \nthe UK who are assessed initially by a General Practitioner (GP), and after six months by \na Benefits Agency doctor, as being incapable of work due to illness or disability and who \nhave contributed sufficient National Insurance payments. IB is similar in remit to the long-\nterm sickness and disability insurance schemes of other Western countries, such as the \nUSA\u201fs Social Security Disability Insurance and the disability pensions of Germany and \nSweden (OECD, 2003). There are three rates of IB including two short-term rates: a lower \nrate which is paid for the first 28 weeks of sickness, and a higher rate for weeks 29 to 52. \nThe third, a long-term IB rate, applies to people who have been sick for more than a year \nand comprises the largest number of claimants. IB can be received up to pensionable \nage.  \n \nThe new Employment Support Allowance (ESA) will involve a two-tier system of benefits \nin which all are entitled to the ESA basic benefit (paid at the same rates as unemployment \nbenefit - Job Seeker\u201fs Allowance). However, those judged (via a medically administered \n\u201ework capability\u201f test) unable to work or with limited work capacity due to the severity of \ntheir physical or mental condition will receive a higher level of benefit (Support Allowance) \nwith no conditionality. Those who are deemed \u201esick but able to work\u201f will only receive an \nadditional Employment Support component if they participate in employability initiatives \nsuch as Pathways to Work (DWP, 2006; HMSO, 2006). \n \nBox 2: \u2018Welfare\u2019 and \u2018Workfare\u2019 \n\u201eWelfare\u201f provision is characterised by the passive and unconditional nature of benefits. \nBenefits are passive, as they provide a \u201esafety net\u201f of cash benefits, and they are \nunconditional, as entitlement comes via citizenship. In contrast, \u201eworkfare\u201f is active, \nproviding a \u201etrampoline\u201f effect whereby receipt of cash benefits is supplemented with \ntraining and work experience. Rights to benefits under \u201eworkfare\u201f are, to varying \ndegrees, conditional upon fulfilling certain obligations such as involvement in training \nprogrammes, work experience or community service. \u201eWorkfare\u201f is therefore defined not \njust as \u201ework for benefits\u201f (Robinson, 1998: 87) but as any active measure which results \nin \u201ean increasing emphasis on the obligations of the workers\u201f (Torfing, 1999). \n \n 4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPassive approach \nThe first (passive) phase of public policy towards the employment of people with a disability or \nchronic illness was framed by the Disabled Persons Employment Act of 1944 which set up \nsupported employment programmes (such as Remploy), medical rehabilitation services, and \nthe post-war employment quota. In the 1970s, these measures were supplemented with a \nnumber of health related out-of-work cash benefits, such as Invalidity\/Incapacity Benefit in \n1971 (IB). During the social security reforms of the 1980s and early 1990s, additional \nrestrictions were placed on these cash benefits (e.g. the introduction of the \u201eall work\u201f test in \n1994). However, a radical shift of policy, fuelled by growing Treasury concerns about the \ncosts of disability related benefits (Treasury, 1998), alongside pressure from disability \ncampaign groups in relation to social exclusion (Barnes, 1991; 2002; Danieli and Wheeler, \n2006), did not occur until the mid-1990s. The Disability Discrimination Act of 1995 (and \nsubsequent amendments) abolished the post-war disability employment quota in favour of a \nmore rights-based approach to the employment of disabled people (Floyd and Curtis, 2000; \nOliver and Barnes, 1998; Pope and Bambra, 2005; Bambra and Pope, 2007).  \n \n \nActive approach \n 5 \nAlthough the UK welfare state has always contained a certain element of active welfarism (for \nexample Beveridge himself was an \u201eactivist\u201f and certainly many of the new post-war cash \nbenefits such as pensions were only available to people who had previously paid national \ninsurance contributions (Fulcher and Scott, 2003)), in more recent decades it has become \nmore prominent and far reaching. In the second (active) phase of government action, people \nwith a disability or long-term condition have represented a key group of working age benefit \nrecipients and, as such, they have been the targets of a number of diverse active labour \nmarket interventions (Treasury, 2003). For example, the Disability Working Allowance (DWA), \nthe New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP), and the Access to Work programme (ATW). \nThese phase two interventions have generally tried to overcome the different barriers which \npeople with a disability or chronic illness face when trying to enter employment, including: lack \nof experience or skills; uncertainty from employers; problems with physical access to work; \nand concerns over pay, hours and conditions (Gardiner, 1997; Goldstone and Meager, 2002). \nThe majority of interventions have been supply-side focused, and participation by people in \nreceipt of benefits has been on a voluntary basis (Bambra et al, 2005; Bambra, 2006). \n \nDespite an increase in these kinds of intervention since the 1990s, the employment rate for \npeople with disabilities is still very low, at around 49%, compared with 81% for those without \n(ONS, 2003).  In 2004, there were around 2.7 million IB related recipients (Prime Ministers \nStrategy Unit, 2005). This has meant that people on health-related benefits have remained at \nthe centre of the welfare reform agenda (Blair, 2002; Prime Minister\u201fs Strategy Unit, 2005), \nwith the benefits of (re)employment for health and well-being increasingly being emphasised \nin policy circles (Black, 2008).  \n \nTowards \u2018workfare\u2019 \nThe replacement of IB with the two-tiered ESA (Box 1) builds on the Government\u201fs previous \nreforms of IB in 1999, when claims became dependent on National Insurance contributions \nand the Personal Capacity Test was introduced. However, the addition of such an element of \nconditionality for people in receipt of health related benefits is new within the UK context \n(although Work Focused Interviews are a compulsory part of the 2003 Pathways to Work \n 6 \nprogramme) and signals a break with the voluntary nature of previous participation in \nemployment interventions. It is in some respects, therefore, the dawn of a third phase of UK \npolicy towards the employment of people with a disability or chronic illness, and one which \ncould be considered as a move towards making these recipients subject to \u201eworkfare\u201f (Box 2).  \n \nINSIGHTS FROM WELFARE THEORY \nAdding conditionality, in the form of compulsory involvement in active labour market \nprogrammes, is novel in terms of UK sickness absence benefits. However, it is in keeping \nwith the reform of other UK benefits (such as the reforms to unemployment benefit of the \n1980s and 1990s) and changes to sickness absence benefits elsewhere, such as in Australia \nor the USA (Stone, 1984; OECD, 2003). These reforms are often presented as being initiated \non the grounds of reintroducing recipients to the labour market or providing an incentive for \npeople who are out of work to look for and return to work (Henning-Bjorn, 2004). However, \nthe application of wider welfare theory provides some alternative explanations.   \n \nWelfare to workfare? \nIn general, these kinds of reforms, which have been taking place in a range of advanced \nwelfare states since the 1980s, have been conceptualised as a gradual transition from a \nFordist welfare capitalism, in which the welfare state and social security were characterised \nby centralism and universal, passive, and unconditional benefits, to a post-Fordist \u201eworkfare\u201f \ncapitalism in which welfare provision is pluralist and benefits are targeted, active and \nconditional (Box 2) (Amin 1994; Peck 2001; Painter 2002). The academic discourse around \n\u201eworkfare\u201f has been accompanied by discussions about the recommodification of labour and \nthe extent to which welfare remains an entitlement of citizenship (Torfing 1999; Dean 2001; \nRobinson 1998). There have also been debates about the extent to which welfare state \ndevelopment is path dependent and the extent to which core characteristics of welfare states \nremain entrenched, despite such changes (Torfing 1999).  \n \nThe transformation of the welfare state and the shift towards welfare to work and\/or workfare \nhas also been accompanied by a shift in political language. Increasingly, there is discussion in \n 7 \npolicy and academic circles of the \u201cunderclass\u201d (particularly in the USA) or the \u201csocially \nexcluded\u201d (a more European concept), constituting the unemployed, the low skilled and other \nmarginalised groups (Byrne, 2005). Welfare to work policy, as evident in government policy \ndocuments on the IB reform (DWP, 2006), is promoted as an \u201canti-exclusion\u201d policy, a way of \nempowering people and re-engaging those who are \u201csocially excluded\u201d with the system. \nHowever, as Byrne (2005) has argued, the articulation of the concept of social exclusion \nwithin policies such as welfare to work has in practice tended to create and reinforce, rather \nthan break down, the main exclusionary economic processes of post-industrial capitalism: the \nwork obtained by welfare to work participants is usually poor quality, low paid and insecure \n(also known as the low pay, no pay cycle). Welfare to work participants therefore represent \nthe flexible reserve labour force required by post-Fordist accumulation practices (Byrne, 2005: \n1).  \n \nReflecting the history of welfare reform, most of the analysis to date has focused on changes \nto unemployment related benefits and benefits associated with lone parenthood (e.g. Peck, \n2001; Lodemel and Trickey, 2001; Clasen and Clegg, 2003; Byrne, 2005). Nevertheless, the \nconceptual framework offered by these theorists also helps explain the reform of sickness \nbenefit in the UK, especially the advent of conditionality and the framing of the policy debate \naround the social inclusion of the sick and disabled.   \n \nReasserting labour discipline? \nThe reforms to IB can also be conceptualised as a way of reasserting labour discipline and \nensuring that work is undertaken. There are four salient aspects of the labour discipline \nthesis: Firstly,  commentators such as Ginsburg argue that the social security benefits system \ndisciplines the labour force by attaching conditions to benefits which \u201eensure that the \nintransigent worker cannot so easily turn to the welfare state for support\u201f (Ginsburg, 1979). \nThis aspect of the labour discipline thesis is evident in the UK reforms as recipients of the \nESA will have to take part in employability schemes in order to receive full benefits.   \n \n 8 \nSecondly, following Piven and Cloward (1971), the IB reforms can be seen as part of a wider \nwelfare state retrenchment, as welfare provision acts as a means of \u201eregulating the poor\u201f.  \nHence, provision tends to be expanded during times of political unrest and subsequently \nreduced once a measure of social peace has been restored.  For example the civil unrest in \nthe USA in the 1960s was associated with a subsequent expansion of the welfare state \nwhich, once social order was restored, was followed up by a series of cutbacks under the \n1980s Reagan administration. Given that the UK has recently experienced a period of relative \npeace, it might be expected that welfare benefits would now be cutback. \n \nThirdly, Katz (1986) argues that the stigma associated with benefit receipt also acts as a \ndiscipline upon the labour force, with dependency on state benefits considered not only a \nmisfortune but a moral failure.  The tiered approach of the new ESA system to claimants may \nheighten this aspect of labour discipline, with those deemed \u201esick but able to work\u201f feeling \nparticularly stigmatised.  \n \nFinally, as David Bryne\u201fs work has shown (2005), the reforms to welfare provision of the last \ntwo decades in the UK and elsewhere (particularly the Clinton era USA) have not been about \nending benefit dependency but about linking benefit receipt more closely to work. So for \nexample, the Clinton administration \u201cEarned Income tax Rebate\u201d and \u201cEarned Income Tax \nCredit\u201d as well as the Blair\/Brown \u201cWorking Family Tax Credit\u201d or \u201cChild Tax Credit\u201d have \nincreased the income of working families substantially, but only whilst they are in work - out of \nwork cash benefits have not been increased. Similarly, as has long been argued in regard to \nthe political economy of the welfare state (see Gough, 1979), these in-work benefits act as \nwage subsidies to low paying employers which are funded via horizontal redistribution within \nthe working population rather than vertically via income redistribution and corporate taxes \n(Byrne, 2005: 156). The IB reforms can thus be seen as the somewhat logical extension of \nthe use of the benefits system to assert the work ethic. The reforms similarly reinforce \ndivisions of who is (working poor) and who is not (non-working poor) deserving of state \nsupport (see below).  \n \n 9 \nNo longer deserving? \nThe 2008 reforms to IB also need to be understood in the context of political debates about \nthe relationship between unemployment and health (Bambra, 2008) and research into the \nrelationship between IB receipt, health and employment (Bambra and Norman, 2006).  \nAlthough, in order to qualify for IB, medical certification by a GP or benefits system doctor is \nrequired, the IB system has long been criticised as providing a means of people avoiding \nwork, and as a mechanism which obscures unemployment levels (Beatty and Fothergill, \n1999; 2002; Beatty et al., 2000; Fieldhouse and Hollywood, 1999; Fothergill, 2001). Indeed \nclaims that disability-related welfare claims represent \u201cwelfare scrounging\u201d are not limited to \nthe UK (OECD, 2003).  Nor are they particularly new; the American Social Security Disability \nInsurance, for example, was subject to similar debate and was subsequently reformed under \nthe Reagan administration in the early 1980s (Stone, 1986). However, individual level \nevidence from recent cohort studies suggests that medically certified sickness absence does \nreflect actual morbidity and mortality (Marmot et al, 1995; Kivimaki et al., 2003; Vahtera et al, \n2004), and recent population level studies found a strong relationship between IB claims and \nmortality (Bambra and Norman, 2006; Norman and Bambra, 2007). Nevertheless, despite the \nabsence of any direct evidence (Bambra, 2006), a popular perception remains that IB is a \ndisincentive to work, particularly in political and media debates about worklessness (Grieve-\nSmith, 2005; Wintour, 2005). This perception appears to underlie the division of conditionality \nfor the ESA between types of health condition: those considered \u201esick but able to work\u201f will \nreceive lower levels of benefit which will also be conditional, whereas those considered to \nhave a more severe illness or disability will receive a higher rate of unconditional benefit. \n \nThe separation of health-based claims into two distinct categories is, on the one hand, a \nlogical consequence of Blair\u201fs \u201ework for those who can, welfare for those who cannot\u201f \napproach to reform (Blair, 2002), and an acknowledgment that previous, more passive \napproaches have often exacerbated the labour market exclusion experienced by people with \na disability or chronic illness. However, on the other hand, the division into two levels of \nbenefits is inevitably tied into notions of the \u201edeserving\u201f and \u201eundeserving\u201f poor (Katz, 1989; \nvan Orschot, 2006). Health related cash benefits are amongst the last in the UK system to be \n 10 \nthe subject of extensive reform and, until recently, did not attract as much popular stigma as \nother types of benefits (most notably lone parent benefits). This is also the case in other \ncountries, where people in receipt of benefits due to ill health or disability have been viewed \nand treated as more \u201edeserving\u201f or morally worthy than those in receipt of other types of \nbenefit (Stone, 1986; van Orschot, 2006).  \n \nIndeed, as Deborah Stone argued in \u201eThe Disabled State\u201f (1986), in many Western countries, \ndisability was for a long time considered to be a special administrative category in the welfare \nstate and one which came with distinctive entitlements in the form of social aid and \nexemptions from certain obligations of citizenship, such as the duty to work (Stone, 1986: 4). \nDrawing on Stone (1986), the IB reforms can be seen as a move away from such an \naccommodating perspective, and thereby represent the beginning of a potentially disturbing \npolitical discourse which dictates that certain types of illness or disability are less deserving of \nunconditional public support than others. The construction of disability has long been an \nimportant feature of the welfare state as, in addition to bestowing political privilege on those \ndeemed disabled (Stone, 1986), it places additional obligations on those considered non-\ndisabled. As Stone comments, the state determines what injuries, diseases, and incapacities \nthose defined as non-disabled have to endure as part of their normal working lives (Stone, \n1986: 4). In this context, it is worth considering that this deserving\/undeserving dichotomy and \nthe redrawing of the lines around what is and what is not incapacity may well reinforce and \nmagnify the existing stigma attached to claims based on mental (as opposed to physical) \nillness (see Slade, McCrone and Thornicroft, 1995; Slattery, 2006).  \n \nEVIDENCE BASED POLICY? \nIn light of the fact it is unclear on what basis it was decided to replace IB with the new ESA \nsystem, it is worth emphasising that, since 1997, the UK government has repeatedly \ncommitted itself to being guided by research evidence about \u201ewhat works\u201f (Blunkett, 2000; \nCabinet Office, 1999, 2000; Mulgan & Lee 2001; Wanless 2004).  The notion of \u201eevidence-\nbased policy\u201f has, of course, encountered a variety of problems since the early days of New \nLabour and it is now widely accepted that research evidence can rarely offer clear-cut \n 11 \nsolutions to complex policy problems (Packwood 2002; Smith, 2007; Young, 2004).  Indeed, \nwithin some policy quarters, the term \u201eevidence-based policy\u201f has now been replaced with the \nless stringent notion of \u201eevidence-informed policy\u201f (e.g. Department for International \nDevelopment 2005).  Nevertheless, official commitment to employing relevant research \nevidence, where it is available, remains.  Hence, given that there is a wealth of evidence \nabout the effectiveness (or otherwise) of return to work schemes for people on IB (e.g. \nBambra et al, 2005; Bambra, 2006), it might be expected that decisions about reforming the \nexisting IB system would draw upon this body of work, at least to some extent. \n \nHowever, welfare reform in this policy area appears to be taking place in something of an \nevidence vacuum.  Not only is there a lack of clarity about the evidence base for the reforms \n(given that there is no evidence about whether adding compulsion to such interventions will \nmake them more successful in helping such claimants return to work) but the evidence base \nhighlighting the questionable effectiveness of previous active labour market programmes \ntargeted at IB claimants in the UK (e.g. Bambra et al 2005; Bambra, 2006) appears to have \nbeen ignored.  Indeed, evaluations of previous employment interventions for people with a \ndisability or health condition suggest the main problem has not been the lack of a component \npromoting compulsion but the supply-side focus of these programmes, especially in areas \nexperiencing low overall demand for labour and a low-wage economy (Bambra et al, 2005; \nBambra, 2006; see also Turok, 2000). \n \nThis paper is far from the first observation that policy developments under New Labour \nappear not to have been based on available research evidence (e.g. Naughton 2005; Smith, \n2007; Stevens 2007) and it must be acknowledged that studies of the relationship between \nresearch and policy have long highlighted the complexity of the process and the vast range of \nactors and interests involved (e.g. Cohen, March & Olsen 1972; Kingdon, 1984, 1995; Weiss, \n1977, 1979).  This is not to say, however, that academics should refrain from drawing \nattention to apparent failures by policymakers to draw on relevant existing evidence or, where \nevidence itself is lacking, to the need for new research agendas to be developed.  For even \nWeiss\u201f (1977, 1979) famous \u201eenlightenment model\u201f of the relationship between research and \n 12 \npolicy, and Kingdon\u201fs (1984, 1995) notion of \u201epolicy windows\u201f, suggest research evidence can \nplay an important role in policy outcomes (albeit in unpredictable and often relatively subtle \nways).  It seems especially reasonable to point out gaps between policy and research in an \nera in which policymakers have specifically claimed research evidence will be prioritised \n(Boaz and Haydon, 2002). \n \nA basic problem with the concept of \u201eevidence-based policy\u201f is, of course, that the term \n\u201eevidence\u201f can itself be interpreted in starkly contrasting ways by different actors (Davies et al. \n2000; McQueen & Anderson 2003; Young et al. 2002).  It may be the case that the reforms to \nIB have been influenced by the government\u201fs experience of previous reforms, or by \nobservations of welfare reforms elsewhere and could, therefore, be loosely described as \n\u201eevidence-based\u201f.  However, as those who are unemployed due to ill health or disability have \nmore complicated barriers to employment (Gardner, 1997), policy mechanisms perceived to \nhave worked in relation to other types of benefit recipients are not necessarily transferable.  \nNor, given the well-rehearsed warnings about ignoring potentially significant differences \nbetween broadly similar contexts (e.g. Marmor, Freeman, & Okma 2005), should it be \nassumed that evidence relating to welfare reforms in other countries will be applicable to the \ncase of IB reform in the UK.  For, although the UK shares some approaches to welfare with \ncountries such as the USA and Australia (Esping-Andersen, 1990), there are also important \ndifferences in the welfare provision of these countries (e.g. Bambra, 2005) and significant \nhistorical differences in terms of the decommodifying effects of cash benefits and support \nservices for people out of work due to long-term sickness (Stone, 1986; Esping-Andersen, \n1990; Bambra, 2005). \n \nIn summary, the specific history of IB in the UK implies that the transfer of policy ideas from \nother contexts is not necessarily appropriate.  The relevant (UK based) research which exists \ndoes not indicate that the reforms to IB described in this paper will be effective in helping \npeople move from welfare into work.  Furthermore, research highlighting the stigma \nassociated with some forms of incapacity claims suggest it will be important to assess the \n 13 \nimpact of recent reforms on people\u201fs experiences of claiming (or choosing not to claim) \nparticular benefits.  \n \n \nROLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH  \nGiven the importance of income maintenance during times of ill health, and the links between \nunemployment and health (Black, 2008), the reforms to long term sickness absence benefits \nin the UK have potentially important ramifications for public health. No-one would want to \ndeny work to those who want it, and indeed many people in receipt of IB report that they do \nwant to work (Prime Ministers Strategy Unit, 2005). However, it is far form clear, especially \ngiven the lack of supporting research evidence, if the current approach to IB reform, \ncharacterised by coercion, conditionality and the stigmatisation of certain recipients, is best \nplaced to facilitate return to work or, indeed, the acquisition of suitable (as opposed to any) \nemployment.  In fact, echoing analyses of other areas of public policy (e.g. Naughton 2005; \nSmith, 2007; Stevens 2007), it seems likely that recent IB reforms have been significantly \nshaped by other factors, such as political priorities and responses to public and media \nconcerns, rather than applicable research evidence. \n \nPart of the problem may be the dearth of research exploring the interactions between ill-\nhealth and the experience of receiving welfare benefits.  For, whilst there have been a \nnumber of studies of the impact of welfare-to-work interventions on employment rates \n(Bambra et al, 2005), and much is known about the links between unemployment and ill-\nhealth (Black, 2008), far less is known about how different kinds of welfare reform impact \nupon individuals experiencing ill-health or disability who are in receipt of benefits, or how their \nexperiences of different welfare benefits might impact upon their health, well-being and \nengagement with the formal economy.  A new research and practice agenda should therefore \nbe developed, one that critically engages with the politics involved in debates about sickness \nabsence and which places public health concerns at the centre.  The experiences of sickness \nabsence recipients need to be incorporated into the theoretical insights that are developed in \n 14 \nsuch work, which could hopefully serve as an important resource to advocates and \npolicymakers involved in welfare reform. \n \nTo begin with, evidence of the efficacy of compulsion on return to work is needed.  Hence, \nevaluations should be undertaken to establish whether making benefit receipt more \nconditional is actually an effective means of increasing the employment of people out of work \ndue to long term sickness, and whether this works without the instigation of concurrent \ninterventions designed to increase labour demand, improve the accessibility of working \nenvironments, and enhance the remuneration received in the entry level jobs typically \nobtained by people leaving benefits.  Such work should be undertaken using a \nmethodological approach which also explores the effects of these reforms (and the \nassociated interventions) on the health and wellbeing of participants (as opposed to merely \nmeasuring the employment effects), not least because, for this group in particular, these \nimpacts are likely to be closely related to longer-term prospects for employment.  Finally, from \na more practice-orientated perspective, community and occupational health practitioners \nshould (re)assert the importance of health within sickness absence debates and feed such \nconcerns into those in charge of commissioning and implementing such interventions so that \nthey prioritise health improvement over (or as a precursor to) return to work.   \n \nCONCLUSION \nIn this article we have outlined the IB reforms and placed them within a historical, theoretical \nand ideological context. Utilising welfare theory we have argued that recent reforms to IB are \na result not of evidence based policy but of a continuing broader political and ideological \ntransformation of the welfare state. In the new politics of welfare, fewer people suffering from \nill health or disability will be considered to be \u201edisabled\u201f and therefore \u201edeserving\u201f of \nunconditional state support. Drawing on the work of Stone (1986), Katz (1989) and Bryne \n(2005), we conclude that in the new politics of the active welfare state, people with a disability \nor a chronic health condition are no longer considered \u201edeserving\u201f. In order to fully understand \nthe impacts of these reforms, research exploring the changing experiences of those who \nclaim (or opt not to claim) incapacity related benefits is urgently required.  We have \n 15 \nemphasised the need for public health to engage with this issue and have suggested a \ntentative research agenda in order to better explore the complex relationship between ill \nhealth, employment and benefits claims. \n  \n 16 \nREFERENCES \n \nAcheson, D.
