Introduction \n \nPioneering work such as Charney et al. (1975) on the link between vegetation loss in sub-\nSaharan Africa and drought persistence highlighted the role feedback mechanisms between \nthe land-surface and atmosphere play in determining climate. Numerous studies since (Zeng \net al. 1999; Friedlingstein et al. 2001) have reinforced our knowledge of how land-surface \nproperties change in response to climatic forcing, the magnitude of which itself is influenced \nby the land-surface changes.  Indeed, vegetation change is accompanied by soil moisture \nchange; which can lead to changes in properties such as surface albedo and evaporation, \nresulting eventually in precipitation changes through the soil moisture feedback (Koster et al. \n2004; Zhang et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2009). These complex feedbacks between the terrestrial \necosystem and climate have been extensively studied using land-surface models, but remain \npoorly understood. \nLand surface models calculate the surface to atmosphere fluxes of heat, water and \ncarbon; and update the state variable of the surface and sub-surface layers (Cox et al. 1999).  \nThey are crucial components of General Circulation Models (GCMs) influencing cloud cover, \nprecipitation, and atmospheric chemistry, with these coupled systems representing key tools for \npredicting the likely future states of the Earth system under anthropogenic forcing (IPCC \n2007). However, representation of highly complex biophysical processes in land-surface \nmodels over highly heterogeneous land surfaces with limited collections of mathematical \nequations, and the tendency of over-parameterisation, infers a degree of uncertainty in their \npredictions (Pipunic et al. 2008). Moreover, a substantial portion of this uncertainty may be \nattributed to the representation of land-surface feedbacks within coupled climate models \n(Notaro 2008). \nEven if atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised, the long-memory \neffect associated with the climate system means anthropogenic warming would continue \nthrough future decades and centuries. However, large uncertainties remain with respect to our \nunderstanding of biogeochemical cycle feedbacks, diminishing our ability to accurately \nmodel climate forcing. Significant progress has been made in reducing uncertainties \nassociated with atmospheric change, but further consideration of the long-term changes in \natmospheric chemistry, and the consequences of the associated climate forcing, remains a \npriority (Dameris et al. 2005; Cracknell and Varotsos 2007; Varotsos et al. 2007). To this end \nimproving the estimations in land-surface models of feedbacks to the climate system \nrepresents a pertinent objective. Data assimilation may be viewed as an optimum solution for \nsuch improvements. \nData assimilation is a method of minimising some of the uncertainties inherent in all \nland-surface models due to their approximation of the complexity in the terrestrial ecosystem. \nObservations, if available, from sources such as Earth Observation (EO) satellites, can be \nintegrated into the model to update a quantity simulated by the model with the purpose of \nreducing the error in the model formulation. The correction applied is derived from the \nrespective weightings of the uncertainties of both the model predictions and the observations. \nThere has been much research focused on data assimilation into land-surface models in \nprevious years. Particular attention has been paid to assimilation of land-surface temperature \n(LST) to constrain simulations of soil moisture and surface heat fluxes. These assimilation \nstudies include the use of variational schemes (Caparrini et al. 2003); and variants of the \nKalman Filter sequential scheme, such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) (Crosson et al. \n2002; Huang et al. 2008; Pipunic et al. 2008; Quaife et al. 2008), first proposed by Evensen \n(1994). \nCoupled GCM land-atmosphere models are important tools for climate change prediction \nand for assessing climate feedbacks over future decades and centuries. However, due to large \nuncertainties with respect to these feedbacks - an example being cloud formation - a \nconcerted effort is required to improve the modelling of water, energy and carbon exchanges \nin these coupled systems, by optimising prediction of key variables, such as soil moisture. \nThe assimilation of observations to improve the quantification of soil moisture has long been \nan objective of the hydrological community (Crosson et al. 2002; Crow and Wood 2003; \nHuang et al. 2008). Margulis and Entekhabi (2003), for instance, assimilated skin and air \ntemperature, plus relative humidity, to optimise the water and energy budgets of a coupled \nland surface-atmospheric boundary layer model. Pipunic et al. (2008) also demonstrated \nenhanced model estimates as a result of integrating EO observations into their land-surface \nscheme, with improved predictions of latent and sensible heat fluxes. This focus on the \nmoisture states of models illustrates the importance attributed to the longer memory \ncharacteristics in coupled systems. Optimisation, as a result of data assimilation, thus presents \nan opportunity to improve our ability to predict water and energy fluxes from the land-surface \nto the atmosphere, with the prospect of reducing climate feedback uncertainty. Moreover, the \napplication of data assimilation in understanding and quantifying feedbacks in the climate \nsystem is not just restricted to land-atmosphere interactions. The role of marine sediments \nand ocean biogeochemistry in the long-term regulation of atmospheric carbon has driven the \ndevelopment of data assimilation techniques in these systems; resulting in improved \nparameter estimation (Annan et al. 2005), and enhanced calibration of ocean-atmosphere \nmodels (Ridgwell et al. 2007) through, for example, the integration of phosphate and \nalkalinity observations. However, as in any coupled chaotic system, minor changes in a single \ncharacteristic can have far reaching effects. \nThis paper considers the sensitivity of related characteristics to the model update of a \nsingle variable, through the process of data assimilation. In section 2, LST over two regions \nof the African continent: an area of West Africa (17\u00b0W to 20\u00b0E longitude, 4\u00b0N to 20\u00b0N \nlatitude); and an area of North Africa (10\u00b0W to 33\u00b0E longitude, 20\u00b0N to 30\u00b0N latitude); is \nintegrated into the state-of-the-art land surface model JULES (Joint UK Land Environment \nSimulator), developed by the UK Met Office, during the period 1\nst\n January to 31\nst\n May 2007. \nThe effect on soil moisture is discussed in section 3, whereby the model simulations are \ncompared with European Remote Sensing Satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) scatterometer top \nsoil moisture observations. Finally, in section 4, the implications of the data assimilation \nexercise on surface energy, water, and carbon fluxes are considered. \n \n2. Land surface temperature \n \nLST is the radiative skin temperature of the land, with wide-ranging influences on several \nbiophysical processes of the terrestrial biosphere: such as the partitioning of energy into \nground, sensible and latent heat fluxes (Sellers et al. 1997; Huang et al. 2008) and the \nemission of long-wave radiation from the surface (Rhoads et al. 2001; Trigo et al. 2008); the \nphysiological activities of leaves (Sims et al. 2008); surface dryness (Sandholt et al. 2002; \nSnyder et al. 2006); and stomatal conductance (Sellers et al. 1997); and its reported response \nas an effect of El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Manzo-Delgado et al. 2004). Sensible \nheat flux (H) is a function of the difference between surface and air temperature (Rhoads et \nal. 2001). Latent heat flux (LE), on the other hand, is a function of surface temperature due to \nthe influence LST expends on vapour pressure deficit (Hashimoto et al. 2008). Within the \nsurface balance equation, LE and H are tightly coupled, in which an increase in one is usually \nat the expense of the other. \nLST also has a role to play in the hot topic of fire modelling within land surface models. \nFor example, it is related to fuel moisture content (Chuvieco et al. 2004), and in combination \nwith other environmental variables can be applied in predicting fire occurrence and \npropagation (Manzo-Delgado et al. 2004). This is particularly crucial for Africa, where \nclimate scenarios remain highly uncertain (Williams et al. 2007), most notably in the fire \ndominated savannas. Here cloud-free LST pixels from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and \nInfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) instrument onboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) \ngeostationary satellites, centred over the equator at an altitude of 36000km, is integrated into \nthe JULES model over two regions of the African continent - West Africa and North Africa - \nfor a five month period of 2007. \n \n2.1. MSG-SEVIRI data \n \nSEVIRI acquires an image every 15 minutes, at a spatial resolution of between 3km and 5km \nfor the African continent. LST is generated by the Satellite Application Facility on Land \nSurface Analysis (LandSAF) using a Generalized Split Window (GSW) algorithm (Madeira \n2002) for channels IR10.8 and IR12.0, as a linear function of clear-sky top-of-the-atmosphere \n(TOA) brightness temperatures. Within each scene, bareground and vegetation emissivities, \npreviously assigned to land cover classes (Peres and DaCamara 2005) are averaged, and \nweighted with the fraction of vegetation cover retrieved by the LandSAF (Garcia-Haro et al. \n2005) to estimate channel surface emissivity. \nIndependent data assessment of the GWS algorithm against a set of radiative transfer \nsimulations indicated a bias free algorithm, with  random errors increasing in response to \nincreasing viewing zenith angle (Trigo et al. 2008), with a reported accuracy of 1.5K \n(Sobrino and Romaguera 2004) for most simulations between nadir and 50\u00b0. Since clouds \nscatter and absorb infra-red radiance, LST retrieval requires identification of cloudy \/ part \ncloudy pixels. Clear sky pixels are identified by the LandSAF through the application of a \ncloud mask which makes use of software developed in support to Nowcasting and Very \nShort-Range Forecasting Satellite Application (NWC SAF; http:\/\/nwcsaf.inm.es); with this \ninformation being represented in quality control flags. A complete description of the LST \nretrieval algorithms can be found in the LandSAF product user manual (available at \nhttp:\/\/landsaf.meteo.pt\/). \n \n2.2. Model description and data assimilation \n \nThe JULES land surface model, which has been described elsewhere (Cox et al. 1999; Alton \net al. 2007) in considerable detail, is the community version of MOSES (Met Office Surface \nExchange System). It is becoming increasing important to the UK ecological modelling \ncommunity since it can be coupled to the Hadley Centre GCM or driven by its output. \nBriefly, JULES is terrestrial gridbox model of a fine temporal resolution, in which each \ngridbox is composed of nine surface tiles: five plant functional types (PFTs) - broadleaf trees, \nneedleleaf trees, C3 grasses, C4 grasses, and shrubs; and four non-vegetation types - urban, \ninland water, bare soil and ice. Each gridbox is profiled into four soil layers, which are \nhomogeneous over the gridbox, with soil thermal characteristics being functions of soil \nmoisture. Prognostic soil fields are updated from values for the previous time step using the \nmean heat and water fluxes over the time step; whereby the total soil moisture content within \neach soil layer is incremented by the evapotranspiration extracted directly from the layer by \nplant roots, the diffusive water flux flowing in from the layer above, and the diffusive flux \nflowing out to the layer below (Cox et al., 1999). Furthermore, the Clapp and Hornberger \n(1978) relations for hydraulic conductivity and soil water suction are applied in the model. \nThe physical processes are driven by meteorological data, which update the state \nvariables typically every 30 or 60 minutes; whereas the biophysical parameters remain \nconstant over the duration of each model run. The output from JULES includes numerous \nvariables depicting the state of the land-surface surface in terms of water, energy and carbon \nfluxes. At each timestep the grid box LST is derived from the sum of the individual tile \nsurface temperatures multiplied by their respective fractional covers within the grid box. \nWhereby the surface energy balance equation for each tile, defined by Cox et al. (1999), is \ngiven by equation (1): \n \nSWN + LW\u2193 - \u03c3Ts\n4\n = H + LE + G0      (1) \n \nWhere SWN is the net downward short wave radiation, which is derived from the surface \nalbedo, LW\u2193 is the downward long wave radiation, \u03c3 is the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant, Ts is \nthe surface temperature, H is the sensible heat flux, LE is the latent heat flux, and G0 is the \nheat flux into the ground. \nHere LST was assimilated into JULES for a five month period from 1\nst\n January to 31\nst\n \nMay 2007, by applying EnKF sequential data assimilation, which applies a Monte Carlo \napproach. The exact methodology, which has been applied previously (Ghent et al. 2009a; \nGhent et al. 2009b), is described comprehensively in Ghent et al. (2009b), with the EnKF \napproach implemented according to Evensen (2003). To give a brief overview though, at \neach timestep, model estimates are nudged towards the observations based on the respective \nstate and observation error covariance matrices, P and R. The correction to the forecast state \nvector is determined by the Kalman gain matrix K defined by equation 2: \n \nK = P\nf \nH\nT \n[ H P\nf \nH\nT\n + R ]\n-1\n        (2) \n \nWhere H is the observation operator relating the true model state to the observations, taking \ninto account the observation uncertainty. The Kalman gain matrix is applied to the difference \nbetween the model estimates and the observations according to equation 3: \n \n\u03c8a = \u03c8f + K (H\u03c8t - H\u03c8f + \u03b5)       (3) \n \nWhere \u03c8a is the updated model estimate, \u03c8f is the forecast state vector, \u03c8t is the true model \nstate, and \u03b5 is the observation uncertainty. The estimate of the model state following the \nupdate is taken as the mean of the ensemble members, with the uncertainty indicated from the \nvariance around the mean. The observation error covariance matrix is a measure of the \nensemble spread of observations, with randomly generated perturbations constructed using \nthe observation uncertainty of 1.5K for SEVIRI LST (Sobrino and Romaguera 2004). The \ndistribution of the model ensemble spread, from an ensemble size of 50 in this case, \ndetermines the state error covariance matrix, thereby avoiding the expensive integration of \nthe standard Kalman Filter. In this study, only perturbations to the meteorological forcing \ndata, generated from normally distributed random number perturbations with zero mean and \nunit variance, following the Box-Muller transform method (Box and Muller 1958), and scaled \nto each variable were considered. Uncertainties in model parameterisation or initial \nconditions were not taken into account. \nMeteorological forcing variables were taken from generated 6-hourly National Centers \nfor Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis datasets (Kalnay et al. 1996); with \nprecipitation data calibrated from monthly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) \nprecipitation data (Kummerow et al. 1998). The model itself was run at an hourly timestep \nover the five month assimilation period, with a spatial resolution of 1\u00b0 x 1\u00b0. Land-cover \nchange was not considered in this experiment, so the fractional coverage of the surface tiles \nwere derived from International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land-cover classes \nand mapped onto JULES according to Dunderdale et al. (1999). Initial conditions were set \nfrom an equilibrium state following a 200-year spin-up cycle; with soil parameters derived \nfrom the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) II soil data set \n(Global Soil Data Task 2000). To quantify the influence LST assimilation has on the state of \nthe modelled land surface the changes in several variables were examined: soil moisture; \nevapotranspiration (ET); and net primary productivity (NPP). \n \n3. Soil moisture \n \nThe partitioning of available energy into sensible heat (H) and latent heat (LE), driven by \nchanges in the surface temperature, is influenced by the vegetative cover and the available \nsoil moisture (Smith et al. 2006). Temperature change in soil is dependent on thermal \nconductivity and heat capacity. A dry soil heats up more rapidly than wet soil, since the heat \ncapacity of water is higher than that of air, which occupies a much greater percentage of the \nvolume in dry soil. A wet soil surface loses more LE, whereas a dry soil surface loses more \nH.  \nSoil moisture exhibits a significant memory, which can persist for many months, \nprolonging and intensifying pluvial and drought events (Notaro 2008). Moreover, soil \nmoisture feedbacks can regulate climate change and increase our predictability of seasonal \nclimate, yet the strength and regional significance of this feedback remains poorly understood \n(Zhang et al. 2008). Evidence for soil moisture \u2013 climate feedbacks includes the relationship \nbetween soil moisture and precipitation; evaporation; air temperature; and cloud cover \n(Findell and Eltahir 1997; Zhang et al. 2008). \nThe most extensive study on soil moisture effects - the Global Land-Atmosphere \nCoupling Experiment (GLACE) (Koster et al. 2004; Guo et al. 2006) \u2013 involved a 12 \nAtmospheric General Circulation model (AGCM) intercomparison illustrated that the strong \nland-atmosphere coupling lies mainly in the ability of soil moisture to affect evaporation in \nthe transition zones between dry and wet climates (Zhang et al. 2008). Identified hotspots \ninclude, the Sahel, the northern United States, and southern Europe. Furthermore, the \nfeedback among Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR4 models was \nassessed over Europe (Seneviratne et al. 2006), with a positive correlation between soil \nmoisture and precipitation. In other words, high soil moisture will support enhanced \nevaporation, increasing atmospheric water content and eventually leading to increased \nrainfall; although this temporal response depends on sub-grid condensation processes within \nglobal models, and therefore can vary substantially (Koster et al. 2004). Moreover, the \nstrength and impact of soil moisture feedbacks are likely to differ between El Ni\u00f1o and La \nNi\u00f1a events (Seneviratne et al. 2006; Notaro 2008); with vegetation interactions also being a \nsubstantial influence (Sellers et al. 1997). \nFuture climate change, driven by increased greenhouse gas concentrations, are likely to \nenhance hydrological responses in these hotspots of strong positive soil moisture feedback \n(Notaro 2008). In respect of this, the importance of global soil moisture retrieval, and \nassimilation into hydrological and biophysical models, has received much recent recognition \n(Crow et al. 2005; Reichle and Koster 2005; Parajka et al. 2006; Parajka et al. 2009). Here \nmodelled and assimilated soil moisture estimations and are compared with ERS scatterometer \ntop soil moisture observations. \n \n3.1. ERS-Scatterometer data \n \nThe ERS-1 and ERS-2 scatterometers are active C-band (5.6 GHz) microwave instruments, \nproviding backscatter measurements sensitive to the surface soil water content without being \naffected by cloud cover. The surface soil moisture data (SSM) are retrieved, in a discrete \n12.5km global grid, from the radar backscattering coefficients using a change detection \nmethod, developed at the Institute of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing at the Vienna \nUniversity of Technology. Scatterometer estimates are used to model the incidence angle \ndependency of the radar backscattering signal. Backscattering coefficients are normalised to a \nreference incidence angle of 40\u00b0, with these coefficients scaled between the driest and wettest \nobservations over the long-term to produce relative SSM data ranging between 0% and \n100%; with uncertainty detailed with a soil moisture noise model (Naeimi et al. 2009). \nThe ERS scatterometer (ESCAT) soil moisture dataset used here has undergone previous \nvalidation experiments. Wagner et al. (1999) tested the SSM dataset with gravimetric soil \nmoisture measurements over field sites in the Ukraine and found mean correlations of 0.45 \n(0\u201320 cm profile) and 0.41 (0-100 cm profile). Furthermore, Ceballos et al. (2005) performed \na more extensive validation using a network of 20 soil moisture stations located in western \nSpain. They found a correlation of 0.75; with a root mean square error (RMSE) (0\u2013100cm \nprofile) between the scatterometer data and the average soil moisture of 2.2%. However, use \nof this dataset comes with the caveat that in extreme climates, such as desert regions, biased \nestimates may be derived, with azimuthal viewing geometry not taken into account during \nretrieval (Bartalis et al. 2006). \n \n3.2. Comparison Model-ESCAT \n \nIn this study modelled soil moisture from the JULES model is compared with SSM \nscatterometer values in the top 5cm of the soil from two separate ERS receiving stations \ngenerating SSM \u2018observations\u2019 for northern hemisphere Africa: Maspalomas, covering West \nAfrica; and Matera, covering North Africa. Since 2001, coverage of southern hemisphere \nAfrica did not begin until mid-July 2008, and therefore is not considered during our \nassimilation period. Figure 1(a) and figure 1(b) illustrate the comparison for both the \nmodelled state and the assimilated state carried out over the five month assimilation period. \nThe SSM \u2018observations\u2019 derived from ERS scatterometers for both West Africa and North \nAfrica are lower than the equivalent modelled by the JULES land-surface model. It is clear \nfollowing assimilation that the updated model estimates are closer to the \u2018observation\u2019 values. \nIndeed, for West Africa a 27.4% reduction in RMSE, from 16.8vol% to 12.2vol% between \nthe model soil moisture estimates and the ERS scatterometer SSM \u2018observations\u2019 resulted \nfrom the assimilation process. For North Africa, the reduction in RMSE between the model \nsoil moisture estimates and the ERS scatterometer SSM \u2018observations\u2019 as a result of the \nassimilation process was 32.2%, from 14.6vol% to 9.9vol%. The modelled and assimilated \nruns were repeated 50 times over each region respectively; and paired t-tests performed on \nthe mean RMSEs showed that these reductions in RMSE were significant at the 99% \nconfidence level. \nIt is therefore evident that the process of data assimilation has produced a systematic \nreduction in the model predictions of soil moisture over both West Africa and North Africa \nfor the period 1\nst\n January \u2013 31st May 2007. The implication is that this reduction may affect \nthe predictions of heat, water, and carbon fluxes from the land-surface to atmosphere. When \ncoupled to the Hadley Centre GCM this altered change in the strength of the soil moisture \u2013 \nclimate feedback could influence the predictions of seasonal and interannual climate. \n \n4. Biogeochemical cycles \n \nThe main aim of this investigation is to understand and quantify the impact a change in LST \nhas on the water, heat, and carbon fluxes from the surface to the atmosphere. It has been \nshown that integrating SEVIRI LST into the JULES land-surface model for the first five \nmonths of 2007 over much of northern hemisphere Africa resulted in a mean reduction in \nsurface soil moisture during this period. We now consider the effect this integration, taking \nthe case of West Africa as an example, has on further key fluxes of the water and carbon \ncycles respectively - ET (figure 2) and NPP (figure 3). Unmistakeable mean reductions are \nobserved for both these fluxes over the assimilation period. \nLST and the partitioning of surface energy into H and LE is a function of varying surface \nsoil moisture and vegetation cover. Predominantly vegetated surfaces are associated with \nlower maximum LST values than bare soil (Weng et al. 2004), with surface roughness a \nfactor (Sandholt et al. 2002). This is because increases in surface temperatures are associated \nwith increases in H, and due to the surface balance equation more energy is partitioned into \nLE for higher vegetative cover; whereas higher H exchange is more typical of sparsely \nvegetated surfaces. LE is enhanced with increased ET, which is controlled by stomatal \nconductance (Essery et al. 2003). Stomatal conductance is affected by the quantity of \nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR), but is also critically linked to the availability of \nmoisture in the soil. A reduction in soil moisture below a critical value causes a partial \nclosing of stomata on the underside of leaves to reduce water loss. The subsequent decrease \nin ET results in a decrease in LE, since the drop in humidity reduces the humidity gradient \nbetween the surface and atmosphere, reducing the evaporative cooling causing an increase in \nH and thus surface temperature (Crucifix et al. 2005). \nET is an important climate system feedback between the land-surface and the \natmosphere in that soil moisture anomalies can translate into precipitation anomalies through \nthe ET rate (Shukla and Mintz 1982). This feedback on the precipitation regime could \nsignificantly influence the occurrence and persistence of pluvial and drought conditions, \nwhich in turn influences the distribution of vegetation and thus surface albedo, subsequent \nsurface evaporation and the terrestrial carbon stocks. The terrestrial carbon cycle feedback \nmay be an important component of future climate change (Melillo et al. 2002), with \nexperiments such as Cox et al. (2000) inferring that these feedbacks could significantly \ninfluence climate change over the course of the next few decades. A reduction in soil \nmoisture and associated reduction in ET impacts upon the carbon balance, leading to a \nreduction in NPP as suggested by Rosenzweig (1968) who postulated, in general, a positive \nrelationship between ET and NPP. With interannual variability of NPP greater than that of \nheterotrophic respiration over Africa (Weber et al. 2009), the implication of a reduction in \nNPP over a region would be a corresponding reduction in net ecosystem productivity, and \nhence an altered carbon balance. However, large uncertainties in both the sign and magnitude \nof the carbon cycle feedbacks remain, because of model simplification of the complex \nterrestrial system. \nData assimilation is an exciting field of research offering significant benefits to land \nsurface modelling. The rationale behind this technique is that although both sources of \ninformation \u2013 model and EO \u2013 are associated with uncertainty, the combination of the two \nsources is expected to reduce the resultant uncertainty. For highly changeable variables in \ntime a land-surface model may produce more comprehensive coverage than an EO product, \nwhich can suffer from missing data or occasional instrumentation problems. However, since \nvalidated EO products can be shown to produce more realistic representations of the ground \nmeasurements, the integration of these into land-surface models may provide the best \npossible compromise. Furthermore, data assimilation is reliant on the accurate prediction of \nuncertainty in observations. EO products are generated using implicit or explicit assumptions, \nwhich may not be consistent with the assumptions made in a land-surface model, whereby \nbiased observations will cause the model to depart from the correct state (Quaife et al. 2008). \nIf remote sensing products are to be integrated more comprehensively into land surface \nmodels, then further validation work needs to be undertaken, with the accurate reporting of \nmeasurement uncertainty a priority. \nAs highlighted in Pinheiro et al. (2006), to demonstrate how a small change can be \ninfluential: Brutsaert et al. (1993) report a 10% error in sensible heat flux as a result of an \nerror of 0.5 K in LST; Moran and Jackson (1991) report a 10% error in ET as a result of a 1 \nK error in LST; and Kustas and Norman (1996) suggest a LST error of between 1 to 3 K can \nlead to errors of up to 100Wm\n-2\n in surface fluxes to the atmosphere. Due to the feedbacks \nbetween the land surface and the atmosphere it is clear how these comparatively minor \nuncertainties can produce significantly different climatic conditions. Climate change can lead \nto both positive and negative feedbacks to the climate system. It is therefore essential that we \naccurately represent these feedbacks in coupled land-surface model - general circulation \nmodel frameworks if we are to successfully predict future climate change. \n \n5. Concluding remarks \n \nThese relationships, among others, suggest that the potential is there for LST to act as \nsurrogate for assimilating other state variables into a land surface scheme. Indeed, demand \nfor LST observations is increasing due to its importance in regional and global ecosystem \nstudies, particularly its sensitivity to surface moisture conditions. Remotely sensed data from \nEO satellites offers the most feasible source of data to constrain and validate land surface \nmodels over large geographical regions, as this overcomes the limitation of sparsely available \nground measurements. The significance of model predictions as a resource in climate policy \ndecision making ensures the validation of increasingly employed data assimilation methods a \npriority. Moreover, care should be taken to quantify the changes in the entire ecosystem \ndynamics through updating of key variables. \nWhile assimilation of EO data into land-surface models offers the prospect of optimising \nestimates of key biogeochemical states, herein the danger lies. Unless a thorough \nunderstanding and validation of the model output is performed the possibility of the model \nbeing improved in one sense, in terms of reduced RMSEs against validation observations, but \ndegraded elsewhere remains a distinct likelihood. In terms of the predictions of \nbiogeochemical fluxes, the acknowledgement of the influence data assimilation of EO data \nhas on the feedback from land-surface models to AGCMs is of great relevance to the IPCC \n5\nth\n Assessment Report. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work has been funded by the NERC Climate and Land Surface Systems Interactions \nCentre (CLASSIC).
