Introduction\n[2] Optical Doppler measurements of high-latitude F-\nregion ion drift velocities, using the O+(2P) multiplet\nemission at 732 nm, have been made from the ground\n[Meriwether et al., 1974; Smith et al., 1982; Smith et al.,\n1985] and space [Carr et al., 1992]. The discovery of this\nemission was first published in 1957 [Sivjee et al., 1979].\nO+(2P) ions are primarily produced in the atmosphere by\nphoto-ionisation of neutral atomic oxygen by solar EUV\nradiation at wavelengths less than 66.6 nm [Carr et al.,\n1992]. A secondary source of O+(2P) ions is electron impact\nionisation with a threshold energy of 18.61 eV [Carr et al.,\n1992]. This condition is satisfied at high latitudes in high\naltitude auroras produced by low energy (< 1 keV) particle\nprecipitation [Smith et al., 1982; Omholt, 1957].\n[3] O+(2P) ions are lost either by quenching or sponta-\nneous photon emission. The emission is the result of the\nmetastable transition between the excited 2P and 2D states of\nO+ ions [Carr et al., 1992]. The metastable O+(2P) ions\nhave a lifetime of 4.57 s [Carr et al., 1992], which gives\nenough time to thermalise the ions [Omholt, 1957]. Mod-\nelling shows that the 732 nm volume emission covers a\nbroad altitude range from approximately 200 to 400 km,\npeaking at \u0001300 km [Carr et al., 1992]. Unfortunately,\nhigh-resolution interferometric observations of the 732 nm\nemission are limited by the low intensity (maximum \u0001150\nRayleighs [Sivjee et al., 1999]) and sporadic nature of the\nO+(2P) emissions in nighttime auroras [Meriwether et al.,\n1974]. In addition, the OH(8, 3) emission at 731.6 nm must\nbe excluded by a suitable optical filter in order to prevent\ncontamination in the O+(2P) observations.\n[4] The O(1D) 630 nm and O+(2P) 732 nm emissions\ncome from comparable altitudes with O(1D) \u0002 260 \u00b1 20 km\n[Kosch et al., 2000] and O+(2P) \u0002 300 \u00b1 100 km [Carr et\nal., 1992]. Measuring the Doppler shift and broadening of\nthese line emissions gives the line-of-sight velocity and\nmean temperature of their source, respectively. O+(2P) will\nyield the F-layer ion convection velocity and ion temper-\nature whilst O(1D) will yield the F-layer neutral wind\nvelocity and neutral temperature. The 630 nm emission\nhas been used extensively for thermospheric research.\nIndependent confirmation of the ion temperatures can be\nmade using incoherent backscatter radar data.\n2. Optical Data Analysis\n[5] For a detailed description of Fabry-Perot interferom-\neters, the reader is referred to Hernandez [1986] and\nVaughan [1989]. The optical instrument used is an imaging\nFabry-Perot interferometer (IFPI) [Kosch et al., 1997a],\nwhich uses an image-intensified CCD detector to image\nup to 3 complete fringes within a 1\u0001 field of view. The IFPI\nis described by Rees et al. [1989]. Here we summarize the\ninstrument used in the present study. The capacitance-\nstabilized etalon has a diameter of 15 cm, a gap of 25\nmm and a reflectance of 86%, making it ideal for thermo-\nspheric temperature analysis. Since the gap of the etalon can\nbe varied over more than 2 free spectral ranges, the fringes\ncan be optimally placed on the detector. In additional,\nfringes of a single-mode HeNe laser (632.8 nm) can be\nscanned across the detector in order to fully define the\ninstrument function. A 5-position filter wheel permits multi-\nwavelength observations. A 2-axis steering mirror system\npermits any part of the sky to be viewed. Various gas\ndischarge lamps are routinely used to monitor the IFPI\u2019s\noperational stability. Full technical details of the IFPI are\ndescribed by Kosch et al. [1997b].\n[6] The analysis of IFPI fringe images for the purpose of\nextracting spectral line profiles is well established [e.g.\nNakajima et al., 1995; Kosch et al., 1997b]. A thermionic\nemission (dark) image, which is taken at regular intervals, is\nsubtracted from the fringe image. This image is then flat\nfielded to remove any spatial non-uniformities in the CCD\npixels\u2019 response to light. The flat-field image is obtained by\nilluminating the IFPI with a weak Tungsten lamp through\neach filter used. The finite width of the filters (0.5\u20131 nm)\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 30, NO. 6, 1293, doi:10.1029\/2002GL015833, 2003\n1Max-Planck-Institut fu\u00a8r Aeronomie, Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany.\n2Communications Systems, Lancaster University, UK.\n3Honorary Research Fellow, University of Natal, South Africa.\n4Physical Sciences, University of Oulu, Finland.\nCopyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/03\/2002GL015833$05.00\n26 - 1\nand the broad continuous spectrum of the lamp ensures that\nno fringes are produced. The fringe image is then reduced to\na line profile in wavelength by integrating pixel intensities\nin annuli, which are incremented in steps of constant fringe\nradius squared (equivalent to wavelength). The same pro-\ncedure is employed for all wavelengths. The exact centre of\nthe circular fringes is determined to sub-pixel resolution by\ntrial and error. This is done by comparing the line profiles\ntaken independently from the four image quadrants. The\nfringe image centre is automatically adjusted until the four\nline profiles are identical within the noise error.\n[7] The analysis of spectral line profiles for the purpose\nof extracting thermospheric winds and temperatures is well\nestablished [e.g. Hernandez, 1978] and is also applicable to\nemission doublets [e.g. Connor et al., 1993] such as O+(2P).\nHere we briefly describe the analysis procedure used for gas\ntemperature extraction. When an excited thermospheric\noxygen atom emits its photon, the line emission will be\nDoppler shifted according to the bulk velocity of the gas\nmotion, which is usually interpreted as the thermospheric\nwind speed. In addition, random thermal motion of the\nemitting oxygen atom will cause a spread in the Doppler\nshifts along the observing line of sight, which amounts to a\nbroadening of the spectral emission line. The fringe profile\nof a line emission in an ideal IFPI is represented by a\nDoppler-broadened Airy function. For a gas in thermal\nequilibrium, the analytical representation of a Gaussian\nsource profile G(l, T) follows from the line-of-sight Max-\nwell-Boltzmann distribution of atom velocities:\nG l;T\u00f0 \u00de \/ exp \u0006 l\u0006 lo\u00f0 \u00de\n2\nc2m\n2l2oKT\n !\nwhere l is the Doppler shifted wavelength, lo is the rest\nwavelength, c the speed of light, m is the molecular mass of\nthe emitting atom, K is Boltzmann\u2019s constant and T is\ntemperature. Setting\nG l;T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\n2\ngives\nl\u0006 lo \u00bc lo\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nln 2\u00f0 \u00dep\nc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2KT\nm\nr\n[8] The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the\nfringe profile is given by\nFWHM \u00bc 2 l\u0006 lo\u00f0 \u00de\n[9] Hence, the FWHM is proportional to the square root\nof the temperature of the emitting gas and all other variables\nare known quantities.\n[10] In practice, a single wavelength at zero Kelvin does\nnot result in an infinitely narrow fringe profile but has a\nfinite width determined by the etalon reflectivity and the\nsum of all instrumental imperfections. This so-called instru-\nment function I(l) can be determined by illuminating the\nIFPI with a single-frequency laser (HeNe at 632.8 nm) and\nis mathematically represented by an Airy function con-\nvolved with several specific fringe broadening functions.\nIn practice, this is done for every observing night for a wide\nrange of fringe positions on the detector (equivalent to\nDoppler shifts). The final data fringe profile F(l, T ) is a\nconvolution of I(l) and G(l, T ):\nF l;T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nZ1\n\u00061\nG\u00f0e;T\u00deI\u00f0l\u0006 e\u00de@e\n[11] Hays and Roble [1971] developed a technique of\nnon-linear fitting the low order Fourier coefficients of an\nidealized Doppler-broadened instrument function to the\nobserved line profile. However, with modern computers, it\nis more convenient in practice to convolve the empirically\ndetermined I(l) with G(l, T ) for various values of T until\nthe best fit is found with the line profile data. Generally, it is\nnot possible to empirically determine I(l) at the same\nwavelength as the observations F(l, T ). We implement\nthe method described by Killeen and Hays [1984a] for\ntranslating I(l) from the calibration wavelength used\n(632.8 nm) to the observing wavelengths (630 and 732 nm).\n[12] Figure 1 shows an example of the O+(2P) doublet\nwavelength spectrum for the integration period 20:45\u201320:50\nUTon 20th February 2001. Data (diamonds) and fitted model\nfringe profiles F(l, T) (solid line) for first and second fringe\ndoublets are shown, giving two estimates of the temperature.\nEach fringe doublet is fitted with the sum of two Gaussian\nsource profiles G(l, T), which is convolved with the instru-\nment function I(l). The nominal doublet separation is 0.08\nnm [Smith et al., 1982]. The doublet separation is a free\nparameter in the fit, giving 0.0797 nm for the first fringe and\n0.0796 nm for the second fringe pair. Free spectral range is\nwell defined [Hernandez, 1986; Vaughan, 1989], giving\n0.0107 nm at 732 nm for our IFPI, which is less than the\ndoublet separation. Therefore, the doublet lines are separated\nby 7.477 orders of interference, which gives an apparent\nseparation of 0.0051 nm in the fringe profile. The relative\nintensity of the doublet is also a free parameter in the fit,\nresulting in a ratio of 0.52\u20130.56 for all the data analysed. The\nrelative doublet intensity coupled to the apparent doublet\nseparation in our IFPI is the reason why one of the line\nprofiles of the doublet appears as a weak perturbation on the\nright hand shoulder of the dominant line. In the observations\ndescribed below, the Doppler shift of the O+(2P) emission is\nunknown because the zero velocity baseline could not be\ndetermined. This is due to having data only in one pointing\ndirection (north). Hence, the zero wavelength position has\nbeen arbitrary chosen.\n3. Observations\n[13] We present the first ground-based optical observa-\ntions of ionospheric F-layer ion temperature using the\nO+(2P) emission at 732 nm. The IFPI used is located at\nSkibotn (69.35\u0001N, 20.36\u0001E), Norway. The IFPI scanned the\ncardinal positions (north, south, east, west) at 45\u0001 elevation\nangle and the local zenith for 630 nm but observed 732 nm\nto the north only. An integration time of 300 s for 732 nm\nand 60 s for 630 nm was used, giving a total cycle time for\nall positions of \u000117 min. The single point measurement for\nO+(2P) was implemented in order to improve the cycle\n26 - 2 CIERPKA ET AL.: OPTICAL IONOSPHERIC ION TEMPERATURES\ntemporal resolution and because previous observations from\nSkibotn had revealed a lack of data for all the cardinal\npositions except to the north. Since the IFPI is a passive\ndevice, an independent means of determining the emission\naltitude is required. The incoherent scatter radar facility\nEISCAT [Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993] is located at\nRamfjord (69.59\u0001N, 19.23\u0001E), Norway, about 50 km north-\nwest of Skibotn. The radar routinely measures F-layer ion\ntemperature with 22 km range resolution and a 1\u20132 min.\ntemporal resolution.\n[14] During the period 17\u201324 February 2001, a campaign\nof IFPI dual wavelength (630 and 732 nm) measurements\nwas made. On three nights (17, 19 and 20 February 2001)\nEISCATwas operating, providing independent confirmation\nof the F-layer ion temperature. Since spatial scanning was not\nimplemented for 732 nm, no IFPI ion vector velocity meas-\nurements are possible. Also, EISCAT was pointing mostly\nalong the local magnetic field line (12.8\u0001 south zenith angle).\nHence, there is a horizontal spatial separation between the\noptical and incoherent scatter measurement volumes of\u0001300\nkm. However, this is not a serious problem for comparison\npurposes since it was geomagnetically quiet with Kp \t 2 for\nall the periods of interest. Likewise, the low auroral activity\non the selected days greatly reduces the risk of contamination\nfrom the first positive N2 auroral emission bands [Sivjee,\nprivate communication].\n[15] Figure 2 shows the results from 17 (panel A), 19\n(panel B) and 20 (panel C) February 2001. On the 17th,\n19th and 20th, Kp was in the ranges 0+\u20131, 1\u0006\u20132\u0006 and 2\u0006\u2013\n2, respectively. The dashed and dotted curves show the F-\nlayer neutral and ion temperatures from the IFPI, respec-\ntively. The uncertainty of the measurements is typically <70\nK. It is seen that the ion temperature is consistently greater\nthan or equal to the neutral temperature, as expected [e.g.\nKilleen et al., 1984b; Cierpka et al., 2000; Kosch et al.,\n2000]. The solid curve shows the EISCAT ion temperature\ndata. The altitude of the radar data was chosen to give the\nbest agreement with the IFPI measurements based on\ncomparing averages for the periods of common data.\nFigure 3 shows the altitude profile of EISCAT averaged\nion temperatures (solid curve) for 19 (panel A) and 20\n(panel B) February 2001. The averaged ion temperature\nfrom the IFPI is shown by the dotted vertical line. The\nintersection of the two curves gives the average altitude for\nthe IFPI measurement to the nearest radar range gate (22 km\nresolution). On the 19th and 20th the 732 nm emission\nappeared to come from approximately 335 and 423 km\naltitude, respectively, which is consistent with the expected\nO+(2P) emission altitude [Carr et al., 1992]. There is\nparticularly good agreement between 23 and 03 UT on 20\nFigure 1.

The solid curve shows the EISCAT\nion temperature data for an altitude of 284, 335 and 423 km\non the 17th, 19th and 20th February 2001, respectively.\nFigure 3. The altitude profile of average EISCAT ion\ntemperature (solid curve) for 19th (panel A) and 20th (panel\nB) February 2001. The average FPI ion temperature (dotted\nline) is also shown.\nCIERPKA ET AL.: OPTICAL IONOSPHERIC ION TEMPERATURES 26 - 3\nFebruary 2001 (Figure 2, panel C). The small time shift is\npresumably due to the \u0001300 km spatial separation between\nthe measurement volumes. The overlap of IFPI and EISCAT\ndata on 17 February 2001 is very limited, making this\nheight estimate uncertain. The apparent IFPI measurement\naltitude was \u0001284 km.\n[16] For the selected altitudes and periods of overlapping\ndata, the average ion temperature from the IFPI and EIS-\nCAT are 1041 and 1084 K on the 17th, 1030 and 1033 K on\nthe 19th, and 1301 and 1308 K on 20 February 2001,\nrespectively. The average IFPI neutral and ion temperatures\nfor the entire data sets are 867 and 1058 K on the 17th, 928\nand 1098 K on the 19th, and 979 and 1277 K on 20\nFebruary 2001, respectively, which is consistent with pre-\nvious results [Cierpka et al., 2000; Kosch et al., 2000].\n[17] Figure 4 shows the IFPI data for 24 February 2001 in\nthe same format as Figure 2. On this day Kp was in the\nrange 0\u20130+. No EISCAT data was available. The average\nneutral and ion temperatures for the entire measurement\nperiod are 831 and 777 K, respectively. Indeed, the ion\ntemperature is lower than the neutral temperature for most\nof the time, which is unrealistic. Presumably, this is due to\nthe O+(2P) auroral emission altitude being below the O(1D)\nairglow altitude. This anomalous result demonstrates that\nthe variable altitude for the 732 nm emission (>100 km)\nlimits the usefulness of the optical method of F-layer ion\ntemperature measurement.\n4. Conclusion\n[18] We show the first optical measurements of high-\nlatitude F-layer ion temperatures. We also demonstrate that\nthese observations are consistent with incoherent scatter\nradar data and the expected altitude of the O+(2P) emission.\nUnfortunately, the variable emission altitude may make\ninterpretation of the results difficult. In order to study this\nproblem more closely further optical and incoherent scatter\nmeasurements with both instruments observing in a com-\nmon volume need to be undertaken.\n[19] Acknowledgments.
