Proteins \nof the inner nuclear membrane have been implicated in organi-\nzation of nuclear architecture and cell cycle control. One such \nfamily of inner nuclear membrane proteins is lamina-associated \npolypeptide 2 (LAP2), generated by alternative splicing from a \nsingle gene (Foisner and Gerace 1993; Harris et al., 1994; \nBerger et al., 1996). LAPs have only been found in vertebrates; \nup to six isoforms exist in humans and mice (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, and \u03b6). \nMost LAP2 isoforms have a closely related N-terminal nucleo-\nplasmic domain of variable length with a nuclear localization \nsignal sequence, a single-membrane spanning region, and a \nshort luminal domain at their C terminus. LAP2\u03b1 is structurally \nand functionally unique. It shares the fi rst N-terminal 187 re-\nsidues with all other LAPs but contains a unique C-terminal \n domain of 506 residues, which lacks a membrane spanning \n domain. As a result, LAP2\u03b1 is distributed diffusely throughout \nthe interphase nucleus except for nucleoli (Dechat et al., 1998). \nAt their N terminus, LAP2 proteins share a LEM (LAP2, \nemerin, MAN1) domain (aa 111\u2013152; Lin et al., 2000), which \nbinds to the DNA bridging protein barrier-to-auto-integration \nfactor (Furukawa, 1999; Shumaker et al., 2001), and a LEM-\nlike domain (aa 1\u201385), which binds to DNA and chromosomes \n(Cai et al., 2001). In addition, LAP2\u03b1 interacts with chromo-\nsomes via its \u03b1-specifi c C-terminal domain in a phosphory-\nlation-dependent manner (Vlcek et al., 1999; Dechat et al., 2004). \nOverexpression of C-terminal fragments of LAP2\u03b1 dominantly \ninhibits assembly of endogenous LAP2\u03b1, nuclear membranes, \nand A-type lamins in in vitro nuclear assembly assays and \ncauses a cell cycle arrest in interphase, indicating a role for \nLAP2\u03b1 in cell cycle progression (Vlcek et al., 2002).\nNucleoplasmic LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A complexes \nare required to maintain a proliferative state \nin human fi broblasts\nVanja Pekovic,1 Jens Harborth,2 Jos L.V.

Perutz Laboratories, Medical University Vienna, 1030 Vienna, Austria\nIn human diploid fi broblasts (HDFs), expression of  lamina-associated polypeptide 2 \u03b1 (LAP2\u03b1) upon entry and exit from G0 is tightly correlated with phosphorylation \nand subnuclear localization of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). \nPhosphoisoforms of Rb and LAP2\u03b1 are down-regulated \nin G0. Although RbS780 phosphoform and LAP2\u03b1 are \n up-regulated upon reentry into G1 and colocalize in the \n nucleoplasm, RbS795 migrates between nucleoplasmic and \nspeckle compartments.

Our results suggest that LAP2\u03b1 and lamin \nA\/C are involved in controlling Rb localization and phos-\nphorylation, and a lack or mislocalization of either protein \nleads to cell cycle arrest in HDFs.\nCorrespondence to Chris Hutchison: c.j.hutchison@durham.ac.uk\nAbbreviations used in this paper: HDF, human diploid fi broblast; LAP2, lamina-\nassociated polypeptide 2; MEF, mouse embryonic fi broblast; NCS, newborn \ncalf serum; NE, nuclear envelope; Rb, retinoblastoma protein.\nThe online version of this article contains supplemental material.\n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published January 16, 2007\n http:\/\/www.jcb.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/jcb.200606139\/DC1\nSupplemental Material can be found at: \nJCB \u2022 VOLUME 176 \u2022 NUMBER 2 \u2022 2007 164\nLAP2\u03b1 is found in stable complexes with the type V \n in termediate fi lament proteins lamins A\/C in the nucleoplasm \n(Dechat et al., 2000). The LAP2\u03b1-specifi c C terminus associates \nwith the C terminus of lamins A\/C (aa 319\u2013566) in vivo and \nin vitro. Dominant-negative lamin mutants, which cause aggrega-\ntion of lamins A\/C, also cause LAP2\u03b1 to redistribute to the \nsame aggregates, indicating a functional association between \nLAP2\u03b1 and lamin A\/C (Dechat et al., 2000). Mutations in the \ngene encoding lamins A\/C (LMNA) cause a spectra of human \ndiseases (termed laminopathies), including muscular dystro-\nphies, lipodystrophies, cardiomyopathies, neuropathies, der-\nmopathies, and premature aging syndromes (Hutchison and \nWorman, 2004). It has been suggested that altered lamin A\/C\u2013\nLAP2\u03b1 associations might occur in laminopathies (Goldman \net al., 2004) because LAP2\u03b1 binds to a region of lamin A\/C where \nmany different mutations have been found. In support of this \nhypothesis, a mutation in the LAP2 gene causing cardiomyopathy \nand affecting the C-terminal domain of LAP2\u03b1 alters LAP2\u03b1 \ninteraction with lamins A\/C (Taylor et al., 2005).\nThe retinoblastoma protein (Rb) has functions in muscle \nand fat cell differentiation and in coordinating proliferation and \ndifferentiation during muscle regeneration (Smith and Kudlow, \n2005). The C-terminal domain of Rb is involved in its nuclear \ntethering, which is essential for its growth-suppressing activity \n(Mittnacht, 1998). In early G1, hypophosphorylated Rb is teth-\nered in the nucleus and is capable of binding transcription factor \nE2F-1, which prevents the transcriptional activation of S phase\u2013\nspecifi c genes and traverse to S phase. Hyperphosphorylation of \nRb during late G1 phase releases it from nuclear tethers, which \nin turn releases and derepresses E2F and leads to passage \nthrough S phase. A-type lamins (Mancini et al., 1994; Ozaki \net al., 1994) and LAP2\u03b1 (Markiewicz et al., 2002; Dorner et al., \n2006) both interact with the C-terminal nuclear anchorage \n domain of Rb. In line with an Rb tethering function of LAP2\u03b1\u2013\nlamins A\/C complexes, LAP2\u03b1 has recently been shown to be \ninvolved in an Rb-mediated negative cell cycle control (Dorner \net al., 2006).\nOne model for laminopathies proposes that mutations in \nLMNA impair the control of cell proliferation, particularly, Rb-\nmediated regulatory mechanisms controlling the exit and re-\nentry into the cell cycle (Gotzmann and Foisner, 2006). In support \nof this model, embryonic fi broblasts from a Lmna\u2212\/\u2212 mouse \nshow cell cycle defects because of reduced levels of Rb (Johnson \net al., 2004). Interestingly, despite the proposed growth-\n suppressive function of LAP2\u03b1 (Dorner et al., 2006), its expres-\nsion is dramatically down-regulated upon cell cycle exit in \nhuman diploid fi broblasts (HDFs) and conversely up-regulated \nduring reentry into the cell cycle (Markiewicz et al., 2002). \nTherefore, we tested the hypothesis that in HDFs, LAP2\u03b1 \nexpression is required for cell cycle progression via direct regu-\nlation of Rb. Here, we report that expression and lamin \nA\u2013dependent organization of LAP2\u03b1 is indeed required for \nmaintaining HDFs in a proliferative state by promoting uniform \nnucleoplasmic localization of Rb. Our fi ndings support the \u201ccell \ncycle\u2013proliferating\u2013aging model\u201d for laminopathies and pro-\nvide a novel biological function for LAP2\u03b1 in cell cycle regula-\ntion of human nontransformed adult cells.\nResults\nChanges in expression, solubility, and \ndistribution of lamins, LAPs, and pRb \nisoforms in quiescent human fi broblasts\nWe previously showed that the expression of LAP2\u03b1 is down-\nregulated as HDFs progress from a proliferating to a G0 state \n after serum starvation (Markiewicz et al., 2002). To further \n investigate LAP2\u03b1 responsiveness to factors that induce quies-\ncence in HDFs, we grew cultures to confl uence and used immuno-\nblotting to investigate the expression of proteins of interest. The \nlevel of expression of LAP2\u03b1 declined dramatically as cultures \nreached confl uence and the protein was undetectable in post-\nconfl uent cultures. In contrast, no changes in the level of ex-\npression of LAP2\u03b2, lamin A\/C, or lamin B2 were detected in \nconfl uent or postconfl uent cultures (Fig. S1 a, available at http:\/\/\nwww.jcb.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/jcb.200606139\/DC1). The level of \nexpression of hyperphosphorylated Rb and, in particular, the \nRbS780 isoform also declined progressively in confl uent and \npostconfl uent cultures and correlated precisely with changes in \nthe expression of LAP2\u03b1 (Fig. S1, a and b). These data confi rm \nthat loss of expression of LAP2\u03b1 occurs as a direct consequence \nof entry into G0 and is closely correlated with dephosphoryla-\ntion of pRb at serine 780.\nTo further investigate the correlation between changes in \nexpression of LAP2\u03b1 and phosphorylation of pRb, we per-\nformed double immunofl uorescence microscopy to investigate \nboth the expression and distribution of total Rb and forms phos-\nphorylated at serines 780 and 795. In cultures induced to enter \nG0 through confl uence, LAP2\u03b1 as well as total Rb (Ab2) and \nRbS780 were barely detected in a majority of cells (Fig. 1, a\u2013c). \nCells still expressing higher levels of LAP2\u03b1 also expressed \nrelatively high levels of RbS780 and RbS795 (Fig. 1, a and c). \nIn contrast to Rb780, RbS795 was still detectable in cells with \nlow levels of LAP2\u03b1 and distributed in a small number of \n nucleoplasmic foci (Fig. 1 c, arrows).\nTo see how the distribution and phosphorylation of Rb is \ncorrelated with expression of LAP2\u03b1, Go cultures were restimu-\nlated to reenter the cell cycle. 12 h after serum restimulation, \nLAP2\u03b1 was detected in the nuclei of all cells and was distrib-\nuted uniformly within the nucleoplasm, excluding nucleoli. Total \nand RbS780 were also expressed in nearly all cells and had a \ndistribution that was very similar to that of LAP2\u03b1 (Fig. 1, a and b). \nIn contrast, RbS795 was located in a restricted number of \n nucleoplasmic foci (Fig. 1 c). 18 h after serum restimulation, \nthe intensity of LAP2\u03b1, Rb, and RbS780 had increased but \n remained uniformly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, \nwhereas RbS795 remained within nucleoplasmic foci. Only at \n24 h after serum restimulation, when the staining intensity of \nLAP2\u03b1, Rb, RbS780, and RbS795 was maximal, were all four \nproteins distributed uniformly throughout the nucleoplasm.\nNext, we investigated the solubility properties of lamins, \nLAPs, and Rb in HDFs using a nuclear matrix extraction proce-\ndure. Using immunoblotting, we found that lamins A\/C and \n lamin B2 were relatively more soluble in proliferating HDFs \nthan in quiescent HDFs. In contrast, both LAP2\u03b1 and LAP2\u03b2 \n displayed increased solubility properties in quiescent HDFs \n o\nn\n August 29, 2008 \nw\nw\nw\n.jcb.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n Published January 16, 2007\nTHE ROLE OF LAP2\u03b1 IN CELLULAR PROLIFERATION \u2022 PEKOVIC ET AL. 165\ncompared with proliferating HDFs. Similarly, Rb was more sol-\nuble in quiescent HDFs than in proliferating HDFs (Fig. S1 c).\nTo investigate the solubility properties of the total Rb and \nthe two Rb phosphoisoforms more closely, G0 or serum-restim-\nulated HDFs were extracted in situ. In most HDFs induced to \nenter G0, total Rb, RbS780, and RbS795 were barely detectable \n(Fig. 1, d\u2013f). Between 12 and 18 h after serum restimulation, all \nthree forms of Rb were detectable and resistant to extraction. \nHowever, although Rb and RbS780 showed a more uniform \nstaining throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1, d and e), RbS795 \nwas located in brightly stained nucleoplasmic foci (Fig. 1 f). 24 h \nafter serum restimulation, when cells enter into S phase, all \n isoforms were relatively more soluble after extraction with \n Triton X-100 (Fig. 1, e and f).\nCollectively, our data suggest that progression of HDFs \nfrom G0 to a proliferating state (and vice versa) leads to a sub-\nstantial remodeling of lamina proteins correlated with a more \ncomplex pattern of Rb nuclear anchorage than had previously \nbeen thought. In HDFs entering or exiting a quiescent state, \nRb appears to be present in at least two different compart-\nments depending on its phosphorylation status. Only when \ncells enter S phase (24 h after serum restimulation) are all \nforms of Rb detected in an apparently uniform distribution and \nlargely soluble.\nRb795 associates with splicing speckle \ncompartments during cell cycle exit \nand entry\nThe nature of the foci detected by antibodies against RbS795 \nwas examined by colocalization with a range of antibodies pre-\nviously reported to detect nuclear foci. There was no substantial \ncolocalization between RbS795 and dense chromatin com-\npartments (detected by DAPI; Fig. S2 a, available at http:\/\/www.\njcb.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/jcb.200606139\/DC1), phosphohistone \nH2A.X, or PML bodies (Fig. S2, c and d). In contrast, there was \nalmost complete colocalization of RbS795 foci with splicing \nfactor SC-35, which resides within splicing speckle compart-\nments (Fig. S2 b), indicating that in cells entering G0, this form \nof Rb is localized in splicing speckle compartments.\nTo further investigate the distribution and nuclear anchor-\nage of RbS795, we performed double immunofl uorescence \nand confocal microscopy on HDFs that had been restimulated \nfrom G0, before and after nuclear matrix extraction. Between \n6 and 12 h after serum restimulation, Rb795 colocalized with \nFigure 1.

However, after 18 h, colocalization between \nRbS795 and SC-35 was lost, but RbS795 was still resistant to \nextraction. Only upon entry into S phase (24 h) did RbS795 \nbecome completely soluble (Fig. 2). Thus, associations of \nRb with the splicing speckles are both growth dependent and \nrelated to the expression of LAP2\u03b1. HDFs just entering the \ncell cycle and expressing low levels of LAP2\u03b1 have RbS795 \nassociated with splicing speckles. As LAP2\u03b1 levels increase, \nRbS795 is no longer associated with speckle compartments \nbut codistributes with LAP2\u03b1 and other Rb forms within \nthe nucleoplasm.\nAbsence of lamin A\/C in HDFs correlates \nwith a mislocalization of LAP2\ud835\udec2, cell cycle \narrest, and accumulation of pRb \nin speckles\nTo investigate whether lamins A\/C directly infl uence the distri-\nbution of Rb within speckles, we performed double immuno-\nfl uorescence on HDFs from a patient with lethal fetal akinesis, \nwhich harbors a homozygous mutation Y259X in the LMNA \ngene and is null for lamins A\/C (Muchir et al., 2003). When \ngrown for 2\u20134 d, an increasing number of Y259X HDFs \n(20\u201340%) displayed an abnormal accumulation of LAP2\u03b1 into \naggregates typically at one pole of the nucleus (Fig. 3). These \ncells stained negatively with antibodies against the proliferation \nmarker Ki67 (Fig. 3 a). In addition, cells that were either nega-\ntive for LAP2\u03b1 or in which LAP2\u03b1 was entirely located within \naggregates had greatly reduced levels of total Rb and RbS780 \n(Fig. 3, b and c). In contrast, nearly all cells containing LAP2\u03b1 \naggregates expressed RbS795, which was mainly located in \n nuclear speckles (Fig. 3 d) colocalizing with anti-SC35\u2013positive \nsplicing speckles (Fig. S3, available at http:\/\/www.jcb.org\/cgi\/\ncontent\/full\/jcb.200606139\/DC1). Therefore, the absence of \nlamins A\/C is correlated with aggregation of LAP2\u03b1 and accu-\nmulation of RbS795 in speckle compartments.\nTo investigate the infl uence of lamins A\/C on nuclear \n anchorage of the different Rb isoforms, control or Y259X HDFs \nwere subjected to extraction with detergents before staining \nwith different Rb antibodies. In exponentially dividing control \nHDFs, the nuclei of most cells stained positively for total Rb \nand RbS780 before extraction. After extraction, \u000b40% cells \nhad greatly reduced or absent staining for total Rb and RbS780, \nwhereas \u000b60% remained strongly positive (Fig. 4, a and b), \n refl ecting the different cell cycle stages. RbS795 was uniformly \ndistributed in the nucleus of most cells before extraction, \nwhereas it was found in speckles in \u000b60% of cells and greatly \nreduced or absent in \u000b40% of cells after extraction (Fig. 4 c). In \ncontrast to control cells, the majority of Y259X HDFs were \nnegative or only weakly positive for total Rb and RbS780 be-\nfore extraction, and nearly 100% of cells were negative for Rb \nand RbS780 after extraction (Fig. 4, d and e), whereas \u000b90% of \nY259X HDFs still contained RbS795 restricted entirely to \nspeckles after extraction (Fig. 4 f).\nThese data suggest that nuclear anchorage of RbS780 was \nlamin A\/C dependent. To test this hypothesis, Y259X HDFs \nwere transfected with either GFP\u2013lamin A or GFP\u2013lamin C and \nprepared for immunofl uorescence before or after detergent \n extraction. RbS780 was strongly retained in most cells that ex-\npressed GFP\u2013lamin A after extraction (Fig. 4 g). Surprisingly, \nRbS780 was not retained in cells expressing GFP\u2013lamin C (Fig. \n4 h). Our data suggest that anchorage of nucleoplasmic forms of \nRb is dependent on expression of lamin A, whereas anchorage \nof forms of Rb located in speckles is independent of lamins \nA and C.\nsiRNA knock down of lamin A\/C and LAP2\ud835\udec2 \nleads to cell cycle arrest and accumulation \nof Rb in speckles\nIn Y259X HDFs, aggregation of LAP2\u03b1 and cell cycle arrest \noccurs in only 40% of cells, suggesting that a compensatory \nmechanism might be abrogating the effects of loss of lamin A\/C \nFigure 2.

To investigate the consequences of loss of lamin A\/C \nor LAP2\u03b1 more directly, we used siRNA to knock down each \nprotein independently.

We observed a \u000b70% reduction in the level of LAP2\u03b1 \nor lamins A\/C expression 48 h after transfection with specifi c \nsiRNA as compared with control siRNA, whereas expression of \nLAP2\u03b2 was unaffected. Surprisingly, lamin A expression de-\ncreased by \u000b30% in cells transfected with LAP2\u03b1 RNAi, and \nLAP2\u03b1 decreased similarly in lamin A\/C RNAi\u2013treated cells. \nThe total amount of Rb and, more dramatically (by \u000b70%), the \nlevels of RbS780 were reduced in both LAP2\u03b1 and lamins A\/C \nRNAi cultures (Fig. 5 a).\nTo investigate the effects of siRNA knock down of LAP2\u03b1 \nor lamins A\/C on cell proliferation, we tested the expression of \nKi67. After transfection with scrambled siRNA, only 10% \nof cells were negative for Ki67. In contrast, \u000b70 and \u000b60% \nof cells transfected with LAP2\u03b1-specifi c siRNA or lamin \nA\/C\u2013specifi c siRNA, respectively, were negative for Ki67 \n(Fig. 5 b). We concluded that knock down of LAP2\u03b1 or lamins \nA\/C in HDFs leads to cell cycle arrest.\nTo confi rm these fi ndings, we performed DNA fl ow cyto-\nmetry on HDFs. Cells were arrested in G0 by serum starva-\ntion, transfected with siRNA, restimulated by addition of \ncomplete serum medium, and harvested 0, 24, 48, or 72 h after \ntransfection (Fig. 5 c). After 24 h, a large proportion of cells had \nentered S phase, and there was no difference in the cell cycle \nprofi les between any of the transfected cultures. 48 h after trans-\nfection (the time at which knock down of LAP2\u03b1 and lamins A\/C \nwere detected), control RNAi cultures proceeded normally \nthrough G2\/M and displayed a cell cycle profi le similar to asyn-\nchronously dividing fi broblasts. In contrast, cultures in which \nLAP2\u03b1 or lamin A\/C had been knocked down had a greater \nproportion of cells in S phase and an abnormally high propor-\ntion of cells in G2\/M phase. In view of previous data, showing a \nnegative effect of LAP2\u03b1 on the G1\u2013S phase transition (Dorner \net al., 2006), our result may indicate that loss of LAP2\u03b1 or lam-\nins A\/C promotes more rapid progression through G1 and pre-\nmature entry into S phase, leading to a checkpoint arrest in G2. \nHowever, 72 h after transfection, the LAP2\u03b1 RNAi\u2013treated cul-\ntures appeared to accumulate in G1 phase of the cell cycle. At \nthe same time point, many cells in lamin A\/C knockdown cul-\ntures had accumulated in G1, but some remained arrested in G2. \nControl cultures were dividing asynchronously at this time \npoint (Fig. 5 c). These data are consistent with a cell cycle arrest \nof LAP2\u03b1- and lamin A\/C\u2013defi cient cells in the G1 phase, pre-\nsumably by activating a checkpoint to overcome defects due to \na premature S phase entry in the previous cell cycle round.\nWe previously reported that down-regulation of LAP2\u03b1 \nafter cell cycle arrest during myoblast differentiation is corre-\nlated with relocation of lamins A\/C from the nucleoplasm \nto the NE (Markiewicz et al., 2005). To investigate the \n effects of siRNA knock down of LAP2\u03b1 on lamins A\/C distribu-\ntion, fi broblasts were costained with antibodies against LAP2\u03b1 \nand either lamin A or lamin C. In cells in which LAP2\u03b1 \nwas reduced or absent, both lamin A (Fig. 6 a) and lamin C \n(not  depicted) concentrated at the NE. In contrast, in control \n fi broblasts or in those fi broblasts in knockdown cultures that \nstill expressed LAP2\u03b1, both lamins were found in the nucleo-\nplasm and at the NE.\nTo investigate the infl uence of LAP2\u03b1 on the nuclear dis-\ntribution of Rb, control and LAP2\u03b1 siRNA\u2013transfected cells \nwere costained with antibodies against LAP2\u03b1 and different \nforms of Rb. Although most LAP2\u03b1-positive control cells had \nRb, RbS780, and RbS795 distributed uniformly throughout the \nnucleoplasm (Fig. 6, b, c, and d), in LAP2\u03b1 knockdown cul-\ntures, Rb was greatly reduced and had a granular appearance \n(Fig. 6 b) and RbS780 was largely absent (Fig. 6 c).

Our data sug-\ngest that knock down of LAP2\u03b1 or lamin A\/C expression in \nHDFs leads to cell cycle arrest, dephosphorylation, and migra-\ntion of Rb into nuclear speckles.\nDiscussion\nLAP2\ud835\udec2 function is required for cell \nproliferation in human fi broblasts\nHere, we show that entry of HDFs into G0 is correlated with loss \nof expression of LAP2\u03b1. Furthermore, in HDFs that are null for \nlamins A\/C, LAP2\u03b1 accumulates in aggregates, which is corre-\nlated with cell cycle arrest. Finally, siRNA knock down of \nLAP2\u03b1 or lamins A\/C in HDFs results in cell cycle arrest, and \nthis is correlated with accumulation of Rb into speckles. Our \ndata suggests that the expression and normal distribution of \nLAP2\u03b1 allows proper regulation of Rb and thus maintains a \nproliferative state in HDFs. Our fi ndings are consistent with \nother reports that show that HDFs lacking lamins A\/C grow \nvery slowly in culture (Muchir et al., 2003) and that HDFs \n harboring mutant lamins enter a senescent state prematurely \n(Goldman et al., 2004). Other papers, however, appear to partly \ncontradict these fi ndings. Embryonic fi broblasts from a Lmna\u2212\/\u2212 \nmouse (\u2212\/\u2212 mouse embryonic fi broblasts [MEFs]) display a \nrapid growth phenotype with characteristics of Rb-null fi bro-\nblasts resulting from proteosomal degradation of Rb (Johnson \net al., 2004). A second paper found that Lmna\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs dis-\nplayed a rapid growth phenotype but suggested that this resulted \nfrom inhibition of TGF\u03b2 signaling, leading to increased phos-\nphorylation of Rb (Van Berlo et al., 2005). We have shown that \nin mouse fi broblasts and adipocytes, LAP2\u03b1 represses E2F \n activity via an Rb-dependent pathway and that knock down of \nLAP2\u03b1 in HeLa cells leads to rapid growth (Dorner et al., 2006). \nAlthough there are discrepancies between each paper as to the \nprecise mechanism involved, all three agree that a loss of lamin \nA\/C or LAP2\u03b1 function leads to rapid proliferation through \npathways involving Rb.\nThe apparent discrepancies between the fi ndings reported \nhere and those reported previously (Johnson et al., 2004; Van \nBerlo et al., 2005; Dorner et al., 2006) probably refl ect funda-\nmental differences between the model systems used. Our study \nexclusively made use of HDFs, whereas the previous papers \nused either MEFs or transformed human cell lines. HDFs are \nable to respond to stimuli, such as genotoxic stresses, by induc-\ning a checkpoint arrest transiently in G2 and eventual G1 arrest. \nThis checkpoint is nonfunctional in MEFs as well as in trans-\nformed human cell lines with inactivated pocket proteins, which \ncontinue to divide or enter apoptosis after exposure to genotoxic \nagents (Baus et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2005). Interestingly, \nFACS analysis of LAP2\u03b1 and lamin A\/C knockdown HDFs \n reveals that, initially, cells accumulate in G2, before entering a G1 \nFigure 4.

Therefore, it appears that HDFs respond to a loss of \nLAP2\u03b1 or lamin A\/C function as if they were treated with a \ngenotoxic stress. Alternatively, the loss of Rb repressor activity \nupon LAP2\u03b1 or lamin A\/C down-regulation may prematurely \ndrive the cells into S phase, causing activation of an incomplete \nS phase cell cycle arrest initially in G2 and eventually in G1. \nTherefore, the reason that previous studies have not found that \na loss of either lamins A\/C or LAP2\u03b1 leads to cell cycle arrest \nis most likely because these studies used cell lines in which this \ncheckpoint pathway was abrogated.\nLAP2\ud835\udec2 maintains pRb within \na nucleoplasmic compartment\nIt has been shown that Rb binds to lamin A in vitro and associ-\nates with intermediate fi lament-like structures in the nucleus \n(Mancini et al., 1994; Ozaki et al., 1994). As Rb is no longer \nanchored in the nucleus of Lmna\u2212\/\u2212 MEFs (Johnson et al., \n2004), these fi ndings are widely interpreted as evidence that \nanchorage of Rb within the nucleoplasm is dependent on lam-\nins A\/C. Our current data suggest that anchorage of Rb within \nthe nucleoplasm depends on both lamin A and LAP2\u03b1. We \nshow that nucleoplasmic forms of Rb are entirely absent from \ncells that contain either no LAP2\u03b1 or in which LAP2\u03b1 is \n entirely restricted to aggregates. These fi ndings are consistent \nwith our previous observations that Rb is anchored within the \nnucleoplasm via its C-terminal pocket C domain, which also \nbinds to LAP2\u03b1 in vitro (Markiewicz et al., 2002). Therefore, \nour results suggest that functional complexes of lamin A and \nLAP2\u03b1 are required for anchorage of Rb within the nucleo-\nplasm of HDFs.\nWe also show that absence of LAP2\u03b1 or its accumulation \nin aggregates is correlated with the preferential association of \nRb with speckle compartments. Previous studies have suggested \nthat Rb can bind speckle-associated protein p84 via sequences \nwithin its N-terminal domain (Durfee et al., 1994). These data \nare entirely consistent with our current fi ndings because the \nN-terminal domain of Rb does not bind to lamins A\/C or LAP2\u03b1 \n(Markiewicz et al., 2002), and we show that Rb anchorage in \nspeckles is independent of lamins A\/C or LAP2\u03b1.\nWe propose that Rb is distributed predominantly within a \nnucleoplasmic compartment, through an association of pocket \nC with LAP2\u03b1 and lamin A. However, Rb can also associate \nwith speckle compartments via its N-terminal domain. Although \nin principle these two modes of association are noncompetitive, \nFigure 5. siRNA knock down of LAP2\ud835\udec2 induces delayed G2\/M \nprogression and eventual cell cycle arrest in G1 phase.

In a related study, we have shown that the introduction \nof dominant-negative lamin A mutants into C2C12 myoblasts \ncauses loss of expression of LAP2\u03b1, which is also correlated \nwith the absence of RbS780 (Markiewicz et al., 2005). \n Dephosphorylated forms of Rb bind to and inhibit the transcrip-\ntion factor E2F, thereby suppressing growth in both normally \ndividing cells and during differentiation of several mesenchy-\nmal cell types (for review see Mittnacht, 1998). Therefore, it \nseems likely that the growth arrest caused by knock down of \nLAP2\u03b1 results from dephosphorylation of Rb. Whether asso-\nciation of Rb into speckle domains is also a prerequisite for \ngrowth arrest is unclear. Certainly, the N-terminal region of \nRb, through which Rb can associate with speckle-associated \nprotein p84, is crucial for both terminal differentiation and \ngrowth suppression (Riley et al., 1997). We propose that func-\ntional LAP2\u03b1\u2013lamin A nucleoplasmic complexes might be \nrequired to anchor Rb in a nucleoplasmic compartment. This \nmay allow correct regulation of Rb by cyclin-dependent kinases \nand protein phosphatases, which in turn makes cells respon-\nsive to environmental stresses, such as genotoxic agents. In \ncon clusion, the corollary of this hypothesis is that a loss of \nfunction of lamin A or LAP2\u03b1, in cells with functional check-\npoint pathways, might lead to irreversible cell cycle arrest \nand possibly cellular senescence because Rb can no longer be \nmaintained in a phosphorylated state within the nucleoplasm \nand instead enters speckle compartments by default. This could \nin turn explain why mutations in lamins A\/C and LAP2\u03b1 both \ncause diseases associated with premature aging  (Hutchison \nand Worman, 2004).\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture and media\nHDFs from a needle biopsy of the forearm were cultured in DME  (Invitrogen) \nsupplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS) and 10 U\/ml penicillin \nplus 50 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, at 37\u00b0C in humidifi ed incubators containing \n5% CO2.

Cultures \nwere trypsinized, counted, and transfected with LAP2\u03b1, lamin A\/C, or \ncontrol siRNA. Transfected cells were harvested by trypsinization after \n0, 24, 48, or 72 h and resuspended in PBS and methanol prechilled \nat \u221220\u00b0C (1:9 ratio). Subsequently, washed cell pellets were incubated in \nPBS containing 100 \u03bcg\/ml RNase and 25 \u03bcg\/ml propidium iodide, \nwashed in PBS, centrifuged, and diluted in PBS for cell cycle analysis on a \nFACSCaliber fl ow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data were collected as \nDNA histograms from 5,000 single-cell events, and cell cycle phase distri-\nbution (percentage of G1, S, and G2\/M cells) was determined by the \nDean\/Jett\/Fox model using FlowJo software.\nOnline supplemental material\nFig. S1 shows expression and solubility properties of confl uent HDFs Fig. \nS2 shows colocalization of RbS795 foci with splicing speckles in confl uent \nHDFs.
