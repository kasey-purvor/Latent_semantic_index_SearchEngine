We present our approach to the design and implementation of this detection system. The simulation in a Monte\nCarlo framework using GEANT4 has been carried out for the spectroscopy and for the imaging of gamma-ray events using the Compton camera design which is\ndiscussed. The results of Compton camera measurements using Germanium (Ge) detectors and the subsequent reconstructed images are also presented.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nE = 6 MeV; d = 5 cm; NE=0 = 38%; NE<6MeV = 53%\n \n \nNr\n. o\nf i\nnt\ner\nac\ntio\nns\n\/e\nve\nnt\n in\n C\nsI\nNr. of interactions\/event in Ge\n1\n2\n2\n3\n5\n8\n11\n17\n26\n38\n58\n87\n130\nDetection system principle\nA fast (pulsed) neutron source will be \nused to activate the object under \ninvestigation (Fig. 1). The prompt \ngamma emission from inelastic \nscattering will be detected, which \nprovides a fingerprint of the explosive \nand thus aids of its identification. Direct \nimaging of the elemental contents of the \nmaterial can be accomplished using the \nCompton camera principle. In addition, \ndetection of scattered-neutron recoils \nwill provide a tomographic image. \nGEANT4 simulation results\nThe GEANT4 toolkit was used for the simulation of the gamma spectroscopy and for the imaging of gamma-\nray events using the Compton camera design. The basic setup for the simulations consists of a segmented \nplanar Ge crystal and a pixellated CsI crystal. The former has an active volume of 60\u00d760\u00d720 mm3 which is \nsegmented into 12 by 12 voxels of 5\u00d75\u00d720 mm3. The dimensions of the latter have been varied to study the \nperformance of the detector. Fig. 3 displays a snapshot of the tracks of 2 MeV gamma-rays passing through \nGe and CsI detectors respectively, as simulated with GEANT4.\nThe distribution of the number of interactions per event in Ge and CsI for full energy peak events for 1 MeV\nand 6 MeV gamma-rays are shown in Fig. 4. To consider the effect of detector thickness, simulations have \nbeen carried out utilising a CsI crystal which is segmented into 8 by 8 pixels of 5.6\u00d75.6 mm2 with thicknesses \nof 100 and 50 mm. The results for these two configurations are displayed in Fig. 5. Another configuration has \nbeen simulated applying CsI crystal which is segmented into 16 by 16 pixels of 5.6\u00d75.6\u00d750 mm3. A \ncomparison of the results is shown in Fig. 6.\nConclusion: A technique capable of detecting and imaging hidden explosives applying PFNA and Compton camera principle has been described. The \ngamma-ray detector design considerations of this system which consists of a segmented Ge detector and a pixallated CsI have been discussed. The GEANT4 \nsimulations have been carried out for various CsI detector configurations. It has been shown that reducing the depth of CsI detector from 10 cm to 5 cm \ndecreases the detector efficiency. Utilising a physically larger CsI crystal will cause an increase in the efficiency as well as in the number of 1-1 interaction \nevents. The Images of cone beam reconstruction applying two planar Ge detectors working in Compton camera mode have been presented.\nM. Farahmand, A.J. Boston, A.N. Grint, P.J.

A 152Eu source (0.13 MBq) was placed 60 mm from the front face of the scattering detector. The scattering and absorbing detectors \nwere separated by a distance of 5 cm. The source was rotated from the normal (0\u00ba) up to 60\u00ba relative to the face of the crystal in 15\u00ba steps. For the 1408 keV\ndecay line in 152Eu, reconstruction images have been generated which are shown in Fig. 7. For the image reconstruction an algorithm has been used based on an \nanalytical technique using a back-projection method.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nFu\nll \nen\ner\ngy\n p\nea\nk \n(%\n)\nEnergy (MeV)\n 5 cm\n 10 cm\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n1-\n1 \nin\nte\nra\nct\nio\nns\n\/1\n00\n00\n e\nve\nnt\ns\nEnergy (MeV)\n 5 cm\n 10 cm\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nFu\nll \nen\ner\ngy\n p\nea\nk \n(%\n)\nEnergy (MeV)\n 16*16\n 8*8\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n1-\n1 \nin\nte\nra\nct\nio\nns\n\/1\n00\n00\n e\nve\nnt\ns\nEnergy (MeV)\n 16*16\n 8*8\nGamma-ray detector\nThe gamma-ray detector has to be \nefficient to detect the characteristic \ngamma radiation for the identification. \nIt also has to be capable of working in \nCompton camera mode for the direct \nimaging.
