The\n2-D architecture also results in numerous bottlenecks due to\narea and routing congestion, such as the memory bottleneck\nin multimedia systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) [1]. Recent develop-\nments in fabrication technology have resulted in 3-D integration\nbeing a potentially viable option for gigascale integration [2],\n[3]. Major potential benefits of vertical integration include\nimproved form factor and the reduction in the total length of\nwiring required for a given system configuration. The wire\nlength reduction alone is reported to reduce the interconnect en-\nergy and propagation delay by up to 51% and 54%, respectively,\nat the 45-nm technology node in [4]. However, the potential\ngain in performance is a strong function of the die area, as\nwe show in this paper. The reduced parasitics for interconnects\ncan significantly simplify the circuit and power distribution\nnetwork design for high-performance applications. In mixed-\nsignal systems, noise-sensitive analog\/RF circuitry is prone to\nfailure due to interference from their digital counterpart through\nthe base silicon substrate. Three-dimensional integration aids\nin the solution for noise isolation as it separates the analog\/RF\nand digital circuits into different substrates, with the metal or\nthe dielectric bonding layer used in wafer-bonding technology\nproviding an effective guard ring [5]. The final footprint of the\npackaged system can also be smaller for a 3-D implementation.\nOne of the main obstacles to 3-D integration is poor thermal\nconductivity and heat dissipation and the resultant temperature\nrise due to the high power density [6]. Another is the relatively\npoor yield and correspondingly high cost due to the possibility\nof one faulty die causing an entire stack to be faulty. Balanced\nagainst this is the possibility of improving yield by reducing\nthe area of individual dies. A well-known method to transfer\nheat out of the die is to use thermal vias, which however\nfurther increases the routing congestion [7], [8]. Nevertheless,\nas we show in this paper, careful thermal-via placement in high-\nperformance systems has the potential to effectively control\nthe temperature in 3-D ICs. Some alternative methods that\nhave been proposed, such as integrated microchannel cooling\n[9], [10] may also be a viable option. Moreover, we show\nthat even though the increased temperature reduces the highest\noperating frequency, the overall system performance can still\nbe comparatively better than in a 2-D implementation.\n0278-0070\/$25.00 \u00a9 2009 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

To get a true improvement\nin performance, an accurate analysis using detailed models\nat different hierarchical levels is crucial. Even though several\nprevious works have addressed this issue [11], [12], [13], they\nmostly concentrate on isolated model development, or target\nsome specific type of system. In this paper, we present a\ncohesive analysis of the technological, cost, and performance\ntradeoffs for digital and also crucially mixed-mode systems,\noutlining the choices available at different points in the design\nand their ramifications. To this end, we collate existing models\nfor area, yield, cost, thermal profile, and performance metrics\nfrom the literature, and modify them as necessary in order\nto facilitate their use for analysis of various 2-D and 3-D\nintegration options using modern technologies.\nThe main contribution of this paper is in developing a generic\nmethodology for performance and cost estimations of 3-D sys-\ntems that can be modified for different applications, as well as\nproviding a comprehensive set of estimation models as building\nblocks. We also use this methodology to provide detailed esti-\nmates for two applications that showcase the potential benefits\nof 3-D integration. We build on our previous work in [14] and\ninclude the testing cost in the cost models. We also crucially\nmodel the connectivity between temperature and performance.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II,\nwe present a short overview of 3-D integration technologies,\nwhile in Section III, all models used are discussed in de-\ntail, including comparisons between models where a choice\nexists, and justification and validation for the choice where\nrelevant. This section also presents our estimation and tradeoff\nanalysis methodology. Section IV presents a case study where\nthe models and methodology proposed in this paper are applied\nto two different applications and cost and performance metrics\nderived for various 2-D and 3-D integration options, highlight-\ning the importance of a tradeoff analysis early in the design\nflow. We end with a discussion and our conclusions.\nII. 3-D INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGIES\nTerms that have been coined for packaging technologies\nin the literature are sometimes interpreted in different ways\ndepending on the context of usage. Hence, we define a few\nterms at the outset to avoid ambiguity. The term System-On-\nPackage (SoP) is used to refer to a 2-D multichip module\n(MCM) arrangement where packaged chips are situated on a\nsingle substrate or across a board. A 3-D stacked arrangement\nof chips or dies is referred to as a System-In-Package (SiP).\nAn electronic system that is laid out on a single die in 2-D is\nreferred to as an SoC.\nThree-dimensional integration techniques can be categorized\ninto two major approaches [15]: folding and stacking. In fold-\ning, a planar assembly with a flexible substrate is folded into\nseveral layers in order to form a compact shape. In this ap-\nproach, the interconnect length is longer than in the stacked ap-\nproach described below, but a very small size can be achieved.\nStacking can be carried out at the chip level with either chip-\nto-chip, package-on-package, or MCM-to-MCM bonding using\nFig. 1. Three-dimensional integration options. (a) System-in-package (die\nstacking using wire bonding). (b) WLI with vertical interconnects.\nepoxy or glues and wire bonding, as shown in Fig. 1(a). These\ntechniques present the opportunity to stack Known-Good-Dies\n(KGDs) in layers [16], improving system yield. As an alter-\nnative to chip stacking, 3-D integration can be performed at\nthe wafer level. Different blocks can be processed on separate\nwafers, and interconnected vertically using through-hole vias\n(THV) or through-Si vias (TSV) to form global communica-\ntion links [Fig. 1(b)]. This effectively reduces the latency and\npower drawbacks inherent to global communication in SoCs\nby reducing the average interconnect length and providing\nthermal dissipation channels. Wafer-level integration (WLI) can\nbe performed in two ways: entire wafers can be bonded together\nbefore dicing (an approach herein after termed 3D-W2W) or\nKGDs are bonded on top of a host wafer containing other\nKGD sites, termed (3D-D2W) [17]. Some other possibilities\nnot considered here include capacitive [18], [19] or inductive\n[20] links for wireless communication between chips [21].\nIn this analysis, we concentrate on stacking methodologies\nand compare between 3D-SiP, 3D-D2W, and 3D-W2W tech-\nnologies, the most commonly practiced approaches in 3-D\nintegration.\nIII. PERFORMANCE AND COST ESTIMATION MODELS\nPrevious works that addressed cost and performance trade-\noffs include [11] and [12], where Liu et al. discuss the mapping\nfrom 2-D to 3-D under the constraints of performance, cost,\nand temperature. However, they omit many 3-D technological\ndetails. The authors of [13] describe a yield and cost model\nfor 3-D stacked chips with particular emphasis on the effect on\nyield of the number of THV.\nWe have previously discussed issues around the design\nchoices of SoC and SoP for mixed signal circuits [11]. The\noverall cost estimation process that we propose here is shown\nin Fig. 2. The first task is to find chip\/module area, as the cost\nand performance is predicated on the area. If not provided by\nthe IP vendor, the area of a digital module implemented in some\ntarget technology can be estimated in a straightforward manner,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Overall cost modeling flow for a chip.\nusing gate information and technology scaling. This procedure\ntakes the gate count and technology information as inputs, and\nestimates a core area which in turn yields the die area. The die\narea, together with input-output (I\/O) information, is used to\nestimate the die cost as well as the package cost, leading to the\noverall chip cost after the addition of other relevant costs such\nas testing, dicing, and burn-in costs.\nHowever, the area of an analog chip depends not only on the\nnumber of transistors and their sizes (in practice, minimum-\nsized transistors are not used in analog circuits) but also on\nthe circuit architecture. For example, in a voltage-controlled\noscillator, the area of the on-chip inductor may be hundreds\nof times larger than that of a transistor. In an analog-to-digital\nor digital-to-analog converter, on-chip resistors and capacitors\nmay occupy a large fraction of the total area. Full custom\ndesign experiences are necessary to estimate the size of an\nanalog chip. The models for core area described below are for\ndigital implementations; it is assumed that area information for\nanalog blocks is available. However, all models following on\nfrom the core area are valid for mixed-mode systems. Instances\nwhere variations with respect to pure digital systems occur are\nidentified and supported by appropriate models.\nA. Chip\/Module Area Models\nIn this section, die, chip, and module area models are pre-\nsented, based largely on the SUSPENS model proposed in [22],\nmodified by revisions proposed in the literature over the years,\nand some additional refinements proposed in this paper.\n1) Die\/Chip Area Model: The area occupied by the transis-\ntors and their interconnects is termed the core area (Acore) of\nthe chip. This area can either be interconnect-capacity limited\nor transistor-area limited depending on the logic type and\nthe available resources such as number of metal layers. For\nexample, memories usually have a very regular structure and do\nnot require many interconnection levels, resulting in a very high\npacking density. However, digital logic circuits are less regular\nand require more connectivity, resulting in the area being either\ninterconnect limited or gate area limited. The core area of a chip\nis estimated from\nAcore = max\n{\nNgd\n2\ng, NgAg\n} (1)\nwhere Ng is the average number of logic gates, Ag the average\nlogic gate area, and dg the gate dimension. For static CMOS,\nthe average logic gate is considered to be a two-input NAND\ngate with a fan-out of three identical NAND gates; for dynamic\nlogic, [23] proposes a two-input NOR with fan-out of an inverter\nas the representative gate. The reasons for these choices are that\nthe NAND gate is one of the commonest gates in random logic\nand is widely used in density metrics; NOR gates are widely\nused in high-speed dynamic logic.\nThe estimation of Ag in (1) can be carried out based on the\nheight and width of the cell layout, determined by the contacted\nmetal pitches of the local metal layers. As per [23], the size of\na two-input NAND gate for a standard drive strength is 4 metal\npitches across by 16 metal pitches, i.e., 4pwL \u00d7 16pwL.\nThe gate dimension is defined in [22] as\ndg =\nfgRmpw\newnw\n(2)\nwhere fg refers to the gate fan-out, pw to interconnection pitch,\nnw to the number of interconnection layers, ew to the utilization\nefficiency of interconnects, and Rm to the average interconnect\nlength. This model was further validated and used in [24], and\nalso used in [25]. However, in modern technologies, the number\nof available wiring levels is much higher, and the variation in\nwire pitch between the lowest and highest levels is significant;\nfor example, the pitch of a global wire is typically several\ntimes that of local wires. Additionally, the higher the number\nof levels, the greater the congestion introduced by the presence\nof vias and studs needed for the interconnection of adjacent\nwiring levels. Therefore, (2) requires a refinement in order to\nbe used with multilevel interconnect structures. One proposal,\nin [24], is to use an average value for pw, while another, in [26],\nis to estimate pw\/nw considering only local and global wires. In\naddition, due to unequal usage of power and clock lines on the\ndifferent metal layers and via blockage, the wiring efficiency for\nsignal wires varies from one level to another. In this paper, the\nchange in wiring pitch and different wiring efficiency factors for\neach layer, as well as the effects of via blockage are considered\nby modifying (2) to get\ndg =\n1 + fg\n2\nRm\nnw\u2211\ni=1\new,ikp,i\npw,i\n(3)\nwhere kp,i and ew,i are the wiring utilization factor (modeling\nthe effect of via blockage) and wiring efficiency factor (model-\ning the routing efficiency), respectively, for the ith layer. Such\nan approach is suggested in [23] and [27]. The term (1 + fg)\/2\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on November 30, 2009 at 05:14 from IEEE Xplore.

Average wire length prediction models.\nis a correction to take into account the fact that a logic gate fans\nout to several gates. The term kp,i is the fraction of metal layer\ni occupied by wires, while ewi can be expressed as the product\nof three factors as\new,i = eirout\n(\n1\u2212 biPGC\n) (\n1\u2212 bivia\n) (4)\nwhere eirout is the efficiency of the routing tool for the ith layer\n(approximately constant over all layers), biPGC the blockage due\nto power\/ground\/clock nets, and bivia the blockage due to vias\n[27]. Sai-Halasz [28] estimates that in the case of two layers of\nidentical wire pitch, the top layer blocks between 12%\u201315% of\nthe wiring capacity of the lower layer, and further recommends\nthat the blocking percentage between levels of varying pitch be\nscaled proportionally with pitch. Hence, bivia on the first wiring\nlayer can be between 10% and 50%, and progressively smaller\non higher metal levels [29]. By contrast, bPGC for the topmost\nlevel is around 30%\u201340%, and less than 3% for the lower levels\n[23]. It is possible, however, to assume a constant ew for all\nwiring layers by a process of averaging the different values in a\nfirst-order approximation.\nThe simplest method to estimate the average wire length Rm\nis to assume that exactly half the wires in a module traverse the\nlength of a gate pitch Fp and the remainder the length of two\ngate pitches 2Fp [30]. Under this assumption, the average wire\nlength Rm in gate pitches is equal to 1.5. However, more so-\nphisticated theoretical and empirical treatments for wire length\nprediction based on Rent\u2019s rule have been proposed in the\nliterature, such as Donath\u2019s [31], Feuer\u2019s [32], Mikhail\u2019s [33],\nand Davis\u2019s [34] models. The basic premise in these approaches\nis the recursive application of Rent\u2019s rule (see next paragraph\nfor more details on Rent\u2019s rule) to smaller and smaller logic\nblocks, and the calculation of their external communication\nrequirements. For the tradeoff analysis, we use Donath\u2019s model,\nsince it gives an upper bound (Fig. 3) on average wire length,\nwhen the average interconnection length is given by\nRm =\n2\n9\n1\u2212 4(p\u22121)\n1\u2212N (p\u22121)g\n(\n7\nN\n(p\u22120.5)\ng \u2212 1\n4(p\u22120.5) \u2212 1 \u2212\n1\u2212N (p\u22121.5)g\n1\u2212 4(p\u22121.5)\n)\n(5)\nfor p \u0002= 0.5, and\nRm =\n2\n9\n1\u2212 4p\u22121\n1\u2212Ngp\u22121\n(\n7 log4 Ng \u2212\n1\u2212Ngp\u22121.5\n1\u2212 4p\u22121.5\n)\n(6)\nfor p = 0.5. Here, p is Rent\u2019s exponent.1\nWhen packaging the core, the I\/O pads providing connectiv-\nity to the outside must be arranged around the periphery and\nmay require a larger perimeter than dictated by the core area\nin order to facilitate their placement according to the minimum\nperipheral pad pitch. Then, the die area is given by\nAdie = max\n{\n(\n\u221a\nAcore + 2pp)2,\n(\nNppp\n4\n+ 2pp\n)2}\n(7)\nwhere pp is the peripheral in-line pad pitch and Np is the\ntotal number of I\/O pads. When the I\/O pads are area array\ndistributed, formulas for the die area is given in [35].\nOnce the die area is known, the packaged chip area can be\nestimated according to the following equation:\nApkged_chip = (\n\u221a\nAdie + 2Lbnd)2 (8)\nwhere Lbnd is the bond wire length.\nNp in (7) is calculated from the well-known Rent\u2019s rule, the\nempirical equation that estimates the growth in the number of\nsignal pins on a circuit as a function of the logic components in\nit. It usually takes the form\nNp = K \u00b7N\u03c1g (9)\nwhere \u03c1 is Rent\u2019s exponent, K is Rent\u2019s coefficient, and Ng is\nthe number of logic gates on the chip or logic partition. Rent\u2019s\nrule in this form is valid only for homogeneous systems, not for\nmore complex systems where modules with different architec-\ntures are integrated to form an SoC. A form of Rent\u2019s rule\ndescribed in [36], which argues that the same power-law ex-\npression holds with modified K and \u03c1 parameters, is given by\nKeq = Ng_eq\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a( n\u220f\ni=1\nK\nNg_i\ni\n)\n\u03c1eq =\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c1iNg_i\nNg_eq\n(10)\nwhere Ki and \u03c1i are the usual Rent\u2019s rule parameters, Ng_i is\nthe number of gates in block i, and Ng_eq =\n\u2211n\ni=1 Ng_i.\nThe chip area models defined in (1) through (7) are compared\nagainst actual data from two microprocessors, the Alpha 21164\nand Intel Pentium, reported in [23], which gives transistor\ncounts as well as area breakdowns for cache memory, CPU\nlogic and I\/O pad ring (Table I). The gate-area-limited and\ninterconnect-limited areas reveal that for both processors, the\ntotal area is interconnect limited according to the models, and\nthat the final predicted value is within 9% of the actual value. In\ngeneral, the greater the amount of data available in a particular\n1The Rent exponent for wire length estimation is approximately 0.1 higher\nthan that used for estimating pin count [23].\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The MCM substrate area Asub\ncan easily be estimated by the method outlined by Bakoglu [22].\nIf the chip pitch Fp is known, the SoP area is\nAsub = NcF 2p (11)\nwhere Nc is the number of chips. It is understood that if only\none chip carrier is available on the module, the footprint cannot\nbe smaller than the chip carrier\u2019s size, and will be limited by the\ninterconnection capacity of the module. In Bakoglu\u2019s method,\nthe interconnect-capacity-limited substrate area is predicated on\nthe average interconnect length at the module level, RM, calcu-\nlated using the same approach as in the chip level estimations.\nIn (6), the number of gates Ng is replaced with the number\nof chips Nc. Furthermore, the Rent\u2019s exponent for modules is\ndifferent from that for chips. Hence, Fp can be limited by either\nthe die-size or the chip carrier-related size. Therefore, the chip\npitch is given by the limiting constraint [22]\nFp = MAX\n{\nFo\nFo + 1\nRMNmcmPw_mcm\nNcewnw\n,Dc, Pc\n}\n(12)\nwhere Nc is the chip count, Fo the average fan-out of a chip\u2019s\nI\/O (typically 1.5), Nmcm the total number of chip I\/Os and\nthe I\/Os to and from the MCM, and nw and Pw_mcm the\nnumber and pitch of module wiring levels, respectively, Dc the\ndimension of the chip and Pc the dimension of the chip carrier.\nHowever, this approach assumes that the components to be\narranged in an MCM substrate are homogeneous, which is\nusually not true for mixed-signal systems. It is understood\nthat this restriction is critical in two respects [30]: 1) in the\nderivation of the wiring capacity limited footprint and 2) in\nthe determination of the module size. This limitation can be\novercome by recomputing an effective chip count and corre-\nsponding average interconnect length for each component as\nfollows:\nEffective Nci =\nNIOmcm\nNIOchip_i\n(13)\nwhere NIOmcm is the total number of I\/O connections in the\nwhole module, and NIOchip_i is the number of I\/O connec-\ntions that the ith component requires. The following summation\ncan be used to find the total SoP (MCM) area [30]:\nASOP =\nNc\u2211\ni=1\nF 2pi . (14)\nB. Yield and Cost Analysis\nThe yield of a bare silicon die, Yd, depends on electrical\ndefects created on each mask layer in the fabrication process\nand the total area of the chip. In [37] a yield function for the\nbare silicon die, i.e., the fraction of dies that is estimated to be\nfault free before wafer-level testing, is proposed\nYd =\n1\n(1 + SD0A)\nN\nS\n(15)\nwhere D0 is the average electrical defect density, S the shape\nfactor of (what is assumed to be) the Gamma distribution of\nelectrical defect density, N the number of mask layers, and A\nthe chip area. System yield is a function of the yield of individ-\nual components and the yield of the integration methodology\nused. This is basically the multiplication of the yields of all\ndies, substrate fabrication processes, and bonding processes.\nThus, overall yield can be uneconomically low for complex\nsystems, unless KGD methods are used.\nThe chip yield, Ychip, is defined as the die yield after wafer-\nlevel testing, i.e., the fraction of dies that is estimated to be fault\nfree after wafer-level testing. This is estimated from the fault\ncoverage, which is defined as the fraction of defects that are\nidentified in the test, and the actual yield of the die on the wafer.\nWhen the fault coverage level is denoted by Fc, [30] shows the\nchip yield is given by\nYchip = Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\nd . (16)\nAfter dicing, known defective dies are scrapped and the rest\nsent on for burn-in. The fraction of dies that are available for\nburn-in and test is known as the pass fraction PF defined as\nthe fraction of dies estimated to be fault free, after the dies that\nwere detected to be faulty in the wafer-level test are discarded.\nPass fraction is given by\nPF = Y Fcd . (17)\nHowever, the higher the fault coverage, the higher the cost;\nthe extra testing time results in extra cost including labor, and\nequipment usage costs. Assuming that a higher fault coverage\nlevel requires significantly increased testing time, the following\nexponential model correlating test coverage level with testing\ntime ttest is proposed in [38]\nFc = 1\u2212 e\u2212kttest . (18)\nHere, k is an empirical constant that defines the steepness of\nthe exponential function. It is assumed that 60 s is enough\nto achieve 99.99% coverage, in order to estimate the value\nof k [38]. Thus, k is calculated to be 0.1. In addition, it is\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on November 30, 2009 at 05:14 from IEEE Xplore.

(19)\nNow, the cumulative cost per die or MCM at the end of each\nprocess step is computed as follows:\nC1,i =\nC1,i\u22121 + Ci\nPF\n(20)\nwhere C1,i\u22121 is the accumulated cost of all steps up to but not\nincluding the present step, Ci is the cost of the present step,\nand PF is the percentage of the die or MCMs that passes the\ncurrent step. The bare-die cost is a function of the raw materials,\nprocess cost, and mask cost of a wafer, which are specific to a\ngiven technology, as well as the number of dies per wafer and\nthe die yield\nC1 =\nCwafer(raw, process,mask)\nNdieYdie\n. (21)\nThe package cost is calculated using a price versus pin count\nassumption as in [39]. For a peripheral I\/O single-chip plastic\npackage, the cost in U.S. dollars is\nCpkg = 0.01e1.16 log(NIO)\u22122.09. (22)\nC. Analytical Die Thermal Model for 2-D and 3-D Integration\nThermal integrity is a critical issue in all high-performance\nchips because system reliability is strongly dependent on the\ntemperature. For vertically stacked chips, due to the higher\npower density in the stacked arrangement, it is difficult to\nremove the excess heat from chips or dies that have more than\n1\u25e6 of separation from the heat sink. The increased heat causes\nfurther leakage, which, in turn, increases the temperature, an\nundesirable cycle which can cause catastrophic breakdown. In\nthe following analysis, the contribution to the chip temperature\nfrom interconnect joule heating is disregarded.\nAssuming the heat dissipates through the Silicon substrate,\nthe average die temperature can be usually described using a\n1-D heat equation when the die size is much larger than its\nthickness (t) [41]\nTdie = Tambient +\n(\nt\nkA\n)\nPchip (23)\nwhere Tambient is the ambient temperature, Pchip is the chip\npower dissipation, A is the chip area, and k is the thermal\nconductivity of the material. The factor t\/kA in (23) is known\nas the effective thermal resistance (R) of the substrate layer and\nthe package.\nIf the same assumption is made that the die size is much\nlarger than its thickness, the maximum temperature in a 3-D IC\noccurs at the highest device layer. Then, as described in [41],\nthe average die temperature of a 3-D IC with m layers is\nT3D = Tambient +\nm\u2211\ni=1\nR(i\u22121),i\nm\u2211\nj=i\nPj (24)\nFig. 4. Signal propagation for worst-case latency in a SoC. (a) Signal propa-\ngation link. (b) Interconnect model.\nwhere R(i\u22121),i is the effective thermal resistance between the\nith and (i\u2212 1)th layer including the glue layer where applica-\nble, and Pj is the power dissipation in the kth active layer.\nRecently, a 2-D thermal model called Hotspot [42] that\ntakes into account lateral as well as vertical heat dissipation in\n2-D SoCs was proposed. This model requires information of\nat least the block-level architecture and power density of each\nblock, and heat resistances and capacitances of the resulting\n3-D heat flow network of all layers up to and including the\nheat sink. When such information is available, the 1-D thermal\nmodel in the proposed estimation flow can be replaced by a\nmore accurate model. In the absence of such information, as in\nmost a priori estimations, a 1-D model with an average junction\ntemperature across the die appears to be reasonably accurate,\nand has been used in many prior works [41], [43], [44].\nWith the increasing power density of nanoscale chips, die\ntemperatures are expected to rise substantially. The thermal\nproblem is further aggravated by the fact that leakage power is\nexponentially dependent on temperature. Hence, rising temper-\natures lead to larger leakage power dissipation and vice versa in\na positive feedback relationship. As was mentioned in Section I,\none effective way to alleviate the excessive heat generated in\n3-D ICs is to incorporate dummy thermal vias (T-vias); the\nthermal conductivity of a die layer is significantly improved\nby the existence of thermal vias. When kthv and klayer are the\nthermal conductivity of a thermal via and the layer, respectively,\nand m is the fraction of area occupied by the thermal vias to the\ntotal area, the effective thermal conductivity of the layer is [15]\nkeff = mkthv + (1\u2212m)klayer. (25)\nTo estimate the thermal resistance, the effective thermal con-\nductivity coefficient for each pair of layers, for example, die\nand glue, should be found.\nD. Interconnect Performance Models\nIn the performance estimations, the latency for the longest\npossible link is the characteristic metric used for comparison.\nFor example, in a planar system, the latency between two\ndiagonal corners is considered, while in a 3-D system, the\ndelay from a corner on the bottom chip to a diagonally opposite\ncorner on the top chip is considered. Please refer Figs. 4\u20136 for\nthe schematics.\n1) On-Chip Wire Delay: Typically, on-chip global signal\nwires are highly resistive while the inductance is negligi-\nble. Hence, signal transmission obeys the diffusion equation.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on November 30, 2009 at 05:14 from IEEE Xplore.

Signal propagation for worst-case latency in 2D-SoP and 3D-SiP type\narrangements. (a) Signal propagation link. (b) Interconnect model.\nThe appropriate model therefore, is a distributed resistance\u2013\ncapacitance (RC) line [22], [46]. A very good approximation\nto the delay over an RC dominated wire with capacitive load\nCL connected at the far-end is given by the first-order Elmore\napproximation [22]\ntrc_d=0.693 {Rd(Cd+cwL+CL)+rwLCL}+0.377rwcwL2\n(26)\nwhere Rd is the driving inverter\u2019s equivalent output impedance\nand Cd the self-loading drain diffusion capacitance, while cw\nand rw are the per-unit-length capacitance and resistance of the\ninterconnect and L its length.\nThe wire capacitance incorporates the coupling capacitance\nto adjacent wires, if necessary with an appropriate switching\nfactor to allow for worst-case coupling [47], resulting in a\ncombined total equivalent capacitance. It can be seen that\nthe delay increases exponentially with length when the wire\nparasitics dominate. The most common method of reducing\nthis delay over long interconnects is to insert repeaters at\nappropriate positions, which makes the wire delay linear with\nlength. However, repeater insertion is effective only when wire\ntime constant (rwcwL2) is at least seven times the time constant\nof a repeater (Rd(Cd + Cg)) [22]. The 50% delay for a repeater\ninserted on-chip wire of length L is\ntrc = k\n{\n0.69\nRd\nH\n[\nH(Cd + Cg) +\ncwL\nk\n]\n+ 0.69\nrwL\nk\nHCg\n+ 0.377\nrwL\nk\nCwL\nk\n}\n+ 0.69\nRd\nH\n(Cd + CL) (27)\nwhere H and k are the delay optimal repeater sizes\nand numbers given by H =\n\u221a\nRd(CL + cwL)\/rwLCg and\nk = L\n\u221a\n0.4rwcw\/0.69rwLCg, respectively.\nFinally, the total propagation delay of the on-chip global\nwire, as shown in Fig. 4(b), is the sum of the cascaded buffer\ndelay (tdrv) at the near-end and the repeater-inserted delay of\nthe RC wire\ntintra = tdrv + trc. (28)\n2) Off-Chip Wire Delay: Interchip wires on a typical pack-\nage substrate are characterized by conductors with low resistiv-\nity and a relatively large cross section in a low-loss dielectric,\nmaking losses due to shunt conductance negligible. Hence,\nsignal transmission exhibits transmission line behavior. In a\nlossy transmission line, both RC and LC delays coexist. For\nLC dominated wires, the signal propagation delay is equal to\nits time of flight\ntLC = ttof = L\n\u221a\nlwcw. (29)\nIf a wire is a very resistive transmission line, the following\nempirical formula for adding the time-of-flight (ttof) delay and\nconventional RC delay (trc_tl) was found in [28] to accurately\npredict the total wire delay\ntRLC =\n(\nt1.6tof + t\n1.6\nrc_tl\n) 1\n1.6. (30)\nFor the interchip communication link shown in Fig. 6(b), the\nfollowing expressions can be derived:\ntrc_tl = 0.693\n[\nZ0(Cd+ Cpad + Cbnd + 0.5CL) +\nLbnd\nZ0\n+ rwL(Cpad + Cbnd + CL)\n]\n+ 0.4rwcwL2. (31)\nFinally, the total delay for the interchip communication link\nis the summation of the cascaded driver delay (tdrv) and the\nRLC-wire delay (tRLC)\ntinter = tdrv + tRLC.

As validated\nin [48], when Vdd is sufficiently larger than Vth, the change\nin Vth with temperature is relatively insignificant. However, as\nVdd is scaled down, Vth has a comparable and counter effect to\nthe change in vsat. Therefore, for a 65-nm CMOS technology\nthe driver resistance can be taken as a constant with increasing\ntemperature [49].\nWire resistance Rw increases linearly with temperature due\nto the change in the effective metal resistivity in relation to the\nbarrier layer. In order to characterize the dependence of wire\nresistance with temperature, a linear relationship given by\nRw(T ) =\n\u03c1(T0)l\ntw\n[1 + tcr_bulk(T \u2212 T0)] (34)\ncan be used [50]. In (34), R(T ) is the wire resistance at\nany given temperature T , \u03c1(T0) is wire resistivity at the ref-\nerence temperature T0, w and h are wire width and height,\nand tcr_bulk is the temperature coefficient of resistance of the\nbulk material, a good approximation for which is tcr_bulk =\n0.0039 \u25e6C\u22121 [50].\nIV. TRADEOFF ANALYSIS FOR SoC, SoP,\nAND 3-D IMPLEMENTATIONS\nThe models and methodology proposed in this paper are\ndemonstrated in a case study comprising a comparison of\ntwo mixed-signal systems, a wireless sensor, and a 3G mo-\nbile terminal. The wireless sensor contains a 2-Mb DRAM,\nan application-specified integrated circuit (ASIC), and Micro-\nprocessor with gate counts of 500k and 300k, respectively,\nand an Analog\/RF block occupying an area of 2 mm2. It also\ncontains a MEMS sensor with an area of 1 mm2. The 3G\nmobile terminal has a similar architecture, but with a larger\nmemory (DRAM) of 128 Mb, and a CMOS image sensor (IS)\nwith a pixel size of 1.75 \u03bcm \u00d7 1.75 \u03bcm, and resolution of\n8 Megapixels instead of the MEMS sensor [51]. Furthermore,\nin the analysis, we consider the ASIC and Microprocessor\ntogether as a single logic block, treating our target system as\ncomprising only four megacells: analog\/RF, logic, memory, and\na MEMS sensor or CMOS IS. For all integration schemes, the\nunderlying manufacturing process is a 65-nm 11-metal CMOS\nprocess with a wafer diameter of 300 mm, a lower level wire\npitch of 152 nm and a global level pitch of 290 nm [2]. We\nalso assume a peripheral in-line pad arrangement and wire bond\npackaging. All other key parameters are listed in Table II.\nFor the different blocks in the systems under consideration,\nthe core areas have been estimated using (1). In the case of\nDRAM, the core area is simply NgAg as memories are cell-area\nlimited due to their densely packed structure. The estimated val-\nues for all blocks, in both cases, are shown in Tables IV and V.\nTABLE II\nREPRESENTATIVE VALUES FOR A 65-nm TECHNOLOGY AND SUMMARY OF\nNOTATION FOR MAJOR PARAMETERS USED IN THE ANALYSIS\nBased on the manufacturers data, the power density for the\nconstituent submodules in our case studies can be estimated.\nThe power density for a DRAM is estimated to be 0.02 W\/mm2\n[52], and for a logic block, 0.12 W\/mm2 [53]. A CMOS IS\nhas an average power density of 0.016 W\/mm2. The power\ndissipation of the MEMS sensor is assumed to be 50 mW,\nwhile for the Analog\/RF block, it is assumed to be 500 mW.\nSince these particular mobile applications do not allow the use\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

For the stacked\narrangement, the highest power dissipating block is placed\nclosest to the board while the other blocks are stacked according\nto descending value of power dissipation.\nIn contemporary IC design, a major design consideration is\nto maintain operating temperature at a level which is not detri-\nmental to the desired performance, reliability, and durability. In\nmost ICs, circuits are designed for a worst-case temperature of\n125 \u25e6C [44]. However, DRAM data retention depends heavily\non operating temperature, and should usually be maintained\nbelow approximately 85 \u25e6C. In this analysis, we assume that the\ntemperature of the outside of the package is maintained at 35 \u25e6C\nwithout any loss of generality. The methodology allows for the\nviability of any operating temperature to be investigated. Wire\nparasitics used for delay estimation in different implementation\nscenarios, as discussed in Section III-D, are given in Table III.\nA. Monolithic SoC\nThe integration of mixed-signal systems in a single die re-\nquires a merging of several technologies such as logic, memory,\nand analog\/RF, which results in increased process complexity\nand area. For example, merging logic circuits with memory\nresults in a lower circuit density and hence a larger circuit\narea, than their logic-only or memory-only counter parts. For\nexample, in a United Microelectronics Corporation 0.18-\u03bcm\ntechnology a 6T-SRAM cell has a footprint of about 4 \u03bcm2 in a\npure CMOS implementation, but is 5.6 \u03bcm2 when merged with\na logic process. In this case, the cell area increases by a factor\nof 1.4 as the result of merging processes [11]. The increased\nprocess steps for merging different technologies are mentioned\nin Table VI. If modules P , Q, and R are merged into a single\nchip, the integrated areas of the composite systems comprising\ntwo and three modules, respectively, are shown in [11] to be\nAP\u222aQ =\u03b1AP + \u03b2AQ (35)\nAP\u222aQ\u222aR =\u03b1AP + \u03b2AQ + \u03b3AR.

The thermal profile is also found in a similar manner,\nusing (24).\nD. 3D-WLI\nThe yield of each 3-D implementation method is the cummu-\nlative yield over all layers (m) and is given by\nY3D = Y2D\nm\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nY2DiYa (45)\nwhere Y2D is the fabrication yield of the 2-D process, and Ya is\nthe yield loss due to the 3-D assembly process. The Y m\u22121a term\nin the equation takes into account the fact that integration of m\nFig. 7. SoP\/SiP integration tradeoff analysis flow.\nlayers of chips requires m\u2212 1 silicon growth or wafer bonding\nprocedures. In the case of D2W stacking, die yield after testing\nshould be considered, so that KGDs are used. Hence, the overall\nyield figures for implementing our target system in 3D-W2W\nand 3D-D2W methods as described in [38] and [54] are as\nfollows:\nY3D_w2w =Y2D\nm\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nY2DiYa (46)\nY3D_d2w =Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\n2D\nm\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nY\n(1\u2212Fc)\n2Di\nYa. (47)\nThe total cost for 3-D WLI is given in (42) and (43). Due to\nlimitations in wafer-level processing, there is no possibility of\nreworking. In the case of D2W integration methodology, wafer-\nlevel test and burn-in costs for each die as well as the cost\nof testing the final module have been considered. However, in\nW2W technology, there is no die burn-in process to contribute\nto the cost.\nIt was assumed that standard test equipment can be used for\ntesting of 3-D chips. If specialized equipment is to be used, their\ndepreciation contribution to the cost has to be considered.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Die sizes are normalized to the largest die in each stack, and are\napproximately to scale. (a) Mobile terminal. (b) Wireless sensor.\nIn a W2W integration methodology, all dies must be of\nthe same size in order to alleviate manufacturing difficulties,\nparticularly the precise alignment of wafers to make the vertical\ninterconnections and facilitate dicing, whereas for D2W inte-\ngration the dies can be of different sizes. The thermal profile is\ncalculated using (24), and when the topmost layer\u2019s temperature\nexceeds the allowable limit, T-via insertion is carried out. The\ncross-sectional area of a state-of-the-art TSV is on the order of\na few \u03bcm2 [55], and inclusion of T-vias result in an appreciable\narea increase, and consequently, yield reduction. Thus, the chip\nmanufacturing cost increases.\nShown in Fig. 8 is the tradeoff analysis flow used to estimate\nparameters for comparison. Also, Fig. 9 shows sizes of each\ndie normalized to the largest die in the stack, and their relative\nposition in the vertical direction.\nV. DISCUSSION\nThe results of the case studies are shown in Tables VII\nand VIII. The following implementation options have been\nconsidered in the tradeoff analyses: a single-chip planar SoC,\nand two-chip and four-chip arrangements of the different imple-\nmentation options of 2D-SoP, 3D-SiP, 3D-W2W, and 3D-D2W\nintegration. In the two-chip arrangement, Logic and DRAM\nblocks have been merged to form one chip while the other\ntwo blocks have been merged to form the second chip. In the\nfour-chip arrangement, each individual block constitutes a chip.\nEach case is discussed in detail in the remainder of this section.\nFor the mobile terminal, 3-D integration provides the most\ncompact design compared to 2-D planar techniques. Irrespec-\ntive of whether two- or four-layer stacking is carried out, the\ndifference in the final footprint is approximately 5%, due to the\narea dominance of the IS. Since the area of the mobile terminal\nis relatively large, the yield of the SoC implementation is rather\nlow, while all other implementations result in higher yields.\nAs can be expected, 3D-W2W integration inherently results in\na lower yield in comparison with other 3-D implementations,\nsince untested dies are stacked together. In spite of this though,\nthe final cost of 3D-W2W is the lowest among all options.\nThis is due to the lower test cost in comparison to 3D-D2W,\nand lower assembly cost in comparison to 2D-SoP and 3D-SiP.\nThe low yield of the SoC solution means that it is relatively\nexpensive when compared to all of the other implementations.\nA 3D-SiP implementation is slightly more expensive than a\n2D-SoP implementation due to the higher assembly cost for a\n3-D stack. Overall, the two-chip arrangement is a clear winner\ndue to the lower assembly cost and higher yield in integrating\ntwo rather than four chips by stacking.\nInterestingly, it appears that an SoC solution is the best\nchoice for the wireless sensor node (Table VIII), because all\nother implementations show a lower performance, higher cost,\nand for the most part, a larger area. A 3D-SiP implementation\nleads to the most compact system, although costing the most.\nThe reason for the comparatively large area in 3D-W2W and\n3D-D2W implementations is that the relatively small individual\nblocks result in a higher power density, and require the addition\nof a high number of T-vias for thermal management. The total\narea increases as a consequence, and the cost and worst-case\ndelay increase accordingly. In this case, T-vias occupy about\n66% of the total area in the four-chip stack, and 49% in the\ntwo-chip stack. The wireless sensor node system is also quite\nsmall in comparison to the mobile terminal, and hence has a\ncomparatively higher yield in all implementation choices. For\nall these reasons, an SoC solution may be the best option for\nsuch low area applications.\nA comparatively elevated temperature can be seen in the\nblock which is closest to the substrate (Ttop) for 3-D imple-\nmentations. As mentioned, this is the result of the increased\npower density caused by the relatively small area available for\ndissipation as opposed to the SoC implementation. This is the\nreason for the higher temperature, for example, in the four-chip\narrangement as opposed to the two-chip arrangement in 3D-\nSiP technology. It should be borne in mind that the accuracy of\nthe 1-D heat model for the particular implementation should be\nverified, and be replaced with a more accurate model wherever\nnecessary.\nOne result that might seem counterintuitive is that 3D-WLI\ntechnologies result in a higher worst-case delay in some cases,\nin spite of the reduction in the average interconnect length.\nFor example, the delay in 3D-WLI technologies is significantly\nhigher than that in a 3D-SiP implementation for both case stud-\nies, and even than in a 2D-SoP implementation for the mobile\nterminal. The reason for the increased wire delay in 3D-WLI\nis due to the use of package-intermediate-interconnects [57],\n[58] in 2D-SoP and 3D-SiP implementations. For global signal\ntransmission, three types of interconnects can be identified in\ngeneral. These are on-chip wires on a top metal layer, off-\nchip printed circuit-board-type traces, and TSVs.

FOR 3D-W2W AND 3D-D2W INTEGRATION,\nTHERMAL-VIAS HAVE TO BE INSERTED IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE TOPMOST CHIP\ntraces and TSVs exhibit fast transmission-linelike behavior\nwhereas even the relatively wide global level on-chip lines are\nmuch more resistive, and exhibit diffusive (i.e., RC) behavior.\nAdditionally, taking a signal off-chip and bringing a signal\non-chip entail chip-to-package parasitics that include the pad\ncapacitance, and bond wire or ball-grid solder ball. Finally, the\nlayer-to-layer TSV connection includes a pad capacitance in the\nsignal path.\nEven taking into account the off-chip drivers and chip-to-\npackage parasitics, off-chip wires are much faster than on-chip\nwires for transmitting a signal for the length of a die edge,\nfor a relatively large die. This is because the fast off-chip\ntraces more than make-up for the chip-to-package parasitics\nby outperforming the RC lines. In 2D-SoP and 3D-SiP, the\nopportunity exists to take advantage of this phenomenon by\nrunning wires off-chip and bypassing long chip-edge to chip-\nedge length RC lines. This is shown in Fig. 6(b). The actual\nsaving will of course depend on the specific layout, but in\n[57], for example, this technique of avoiding long on-chip\nwires by running them off-chip to realize Package-Intermediate\nInterconnects, is reported to yield a saving of up to 40%, even\nconsidering the chip-to-package parasitics.\nThe layout and die sizes are a critical factor in determining\nthe relative speed in different implementation technologies. If\nthe layout permits communicating blocks to be placed vertically\nclose to each other, for example, vertical integration does\nprovide an excellent opportunity to substantially reduce the\ncommunication delay. For the specific cases considered in this\npaper, the quantitative results based on accurate parasitics show\nthat signal transmission from the corner of one chip to the\ndiagonally opposed corner of another (A to B in Fig. 6) is faster\nin the 2-D SoP- and 3-D SiP-type implementations due to the\noutperformance of the long on-chip wires.\nAnother contributing factor is the increased temperatures in\nthe higher level layers, which has an adverse effect on device\nand interconnect performance, although this is of less signifi-\ncance. This difference is on the order of tens of picoseconds, as\ncompared with previous values in [14], which did not include\nthis refinement.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we presented detailed and quantitative area,\nyield, and cost models, and simple yet useful thermal models,\nas well as performance metrics for evaluating 3-D integration\noptions. We combined these models in a cohesive cost and per-\nformance tradeoff analysis methodology which is suitable for\nearly analysis and design space explorations of future nanoscale\nelectronic systems. Using example contemporary mixed-signal\nsystems, we demonstrated the use of the proposed methodology\nand models in analyzing the impact of different implemen-\ntations, and conclude that the implementation strategy must\nbe carefully selected depending on the circuit complexity and\narchitecture, as otherwise the move to 3-D may have a detri-\nmental effect. Design choice early in the design cycle will\nhave a significant impact throughout the design and production\nlifecycles, and it is expected that the models and methodology\npresented in this paper will be a useful aid in this choice.\nTopics earmarked for future work include the addition of more\ntechnology options as well as the use of a more sophisticated\nheat flow model.\nREFERENCES\n[1] F.
