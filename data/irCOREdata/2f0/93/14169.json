Much discussion and exploratory work\nhas been undertaken, moving us towards what has been called \u201cthe learning object\neconomy\u201d (Downes, 2001; Campbell, 2003), where teachers, course developers and\nlearners can share, reuse and re-purpose digital materials for incorporation into teach-\ning and learning. Some potential benefits of this \u2018economy\u2019 include: minimising\nduplication of effort for individual teachers across subject areas; reducing costs for\n*Corresponding author.

In the past few years, various institutions and projects have been develop-\ning repositories for these reusable learning objects (Downes, 2003) supported by\ninternational standardization work, notably the suite of specifications produced by\nthe IMS Global Learning Consortium (IMS). Downes (2003) suggests that the next\nstage of development in this \u201ceconomy of education\u201d should be the development of\na network of distributed learning object repositories.\nBecause metadata enables users to discover and select digital learning resources\nsuitable to their requirements, it is a vital component of the learning object economy,\nany future distributed networks and the learning object repositories within them.\nExtensive groundwork has been carried out in this area, mainly centred upon the\ndevelopment of the IEEE Learning Object Metadata standard, known as \u2018the LOM\u2019\n(IEEE LTSC, 2002). IEEE worked closely with the interoperability body IMS in\ncreating the LOM; hence it is integral to such learning technology specifications as\nIMS Content Packaging and IMS Digital Repositories Interoperability. The UK has\nplayed a central role worldwide in the ongoing development of good practice,\ncommon usage and appropriate vocabularies for the LOM, including Graham\nand Campbell\u2019s (2003) \u2018UK LOM Core\u2019 (originally known as the UK Common\nMetadata Framework).\nSo, given the existence of this work, why is there a need for further quality assur-\nance? The key to answering this question involves distinguishing between the\nconcepts of structure and content. The developments above deal primarily with the\nstructure of the metadata; this paper is concerned with the creation of the content of\nthe metadata fields. Once a metadata standard has been implemented within a\nsystem, the specified fields must be filled out with real data about real resources; this\nprocess brings its own problems. For searchers, these manifest themselves in various\nways, including poor recall of available resources and inconsistency of search results.\nThey arise due to errors, omissions and ambiguities in the metadata, many of which\nare known and understood in other communities of practice with tried and tested\nsolutions.\nWithin e-learning the problems of metadata creation have yet to be fully addressed.\nWhen this paper was first drafted for ALT-C  in February 2003, almost no formal\nresearch had been carried out into the process of filling in metadata fields describing\nlearning objects. However, informal consultation via e-learning metadata forums\nrevealed a significant number of colleagues who shared our concerns. All agreed,\nusually from personal experience, that the issue of who creates metadata and how has\nan important impact on the quality of collections of digital materials for resource\ndiscovery by end users.\nThe scope of this paper\nThis paper surveys the issue of metadata creation for digital learning object reposito-\nries with an emphasis on quality assurance, presenting three cases of repositories\nwhose experiences have raised issues for debate and further investigation. We have\n Quality assurance for digital learning object repositories:\n \n7\n  limited our scope to the realm of \u201chuman metadata generation\u201d (Greenberg &\nRobertson, 2002), wherein a \u201cperson intellectually manages the metadata genera-\ntion\u201d. The issue of machine-generated metadata continues to be the subject of\nextensive research within such disciplines as computer and information sciences,\ndata mining and artificial intelligence, and there is much to be learned there for learn-\ning object repositories. However, we are not yet in a situation where machines can\nhandle all metadata tasks, particularly in an area where many resources have limited\ntextual content. Those tasks that require human intelligence and creativity can\ninclude such areas as subject classification, educational attributes and determining\nthe contributors to a resource. This is the domain with which we are concerned.\nWe are also only investigating the creation of metadata necessary for resource\ndiscovery via searching and browsing, although such metadata can also be used for\nresource selection. There has been much recent discussion on what has been called\nsecondary or conceptual metadata (McLean & Lynch, 2003), usage data or \u201cthird\nparty metadata\u201d (Downes, 2003). This refers primarily (but not exclusively) to\nmetadata created about the use of a resource for teaching and learning, generally\nencompassing the idea of reviews or comments by users and intended to facilitate\nselection of appropriate resources. This issue is in the very early stages of investigation\nand the distinction may not be as clear-cut as we have stated here, but for clarity\u2019s\nsake we have excluded it from this paper\u2019s scope. However, there will no doubt be\nimplications for quality assurance.\nIt is worth noting that, although we focus on the creation of metadata necessary for\nresource discovery, none of the evidence we found in the e-learning domain included\nresearch into the ways in which users actually carry out resource discovery. This is a\nsignificant gap, perhaps arising from the paucity of working, well-populated reposito-\nries; however, other disciplines, such as library and information science, may give\npreliminary pointers on these issues. This area of research is vital for the formation of\npriorities and policies for metadata creation. We will return to this in our final section\noutlining future research questions.\nMetadata is powerful\nAlthough many learning resources are available on the web, searching the whole web\nusing a search engine such as Google can prove unsatisfactory. Even with localised or\nadvanced Google-type searching within e-learning, learning objects come in a variety\nof formats; those which are images (including PDF text files), animations or simula-\ntions may have very limited textual content to search. Browsing a directory of web\nresources which have been selected on the basis of some criteria, typically subject, can\nalso be time-consuming, particularly when the sought-after material exists only as a\nsmall chunk embedded within a larger resource. One purpose of digital repositories\nis to overcome these problems by collecting good quality resources, preferably in\nsmall chunks (Duncan, 2003a), together with detailed, consistent information about\nthem, thereby enabling users to conduct precisely targeted searches and to retrieve\nrelevant materials in an efficient and effective manner.\n 8\n \nS. Currier \n \net al.\n            This detailed information about resources, or metadata, is therefore key to unlock-\ning their potential for reuse. At its best, \u201caccurate, consistent, sufficient, and thus reli-\nable\u201d (Greenberg & Robertson, 2002) metadata is a powerful tool that enables the\nuser to discover and retrieve relevant materials quickly and easily and to assess\nwhether they may be suitable for reuse. At worst, poor quality metadata can mean\nthat a resource is essentially invisible within the repository and remains unused.\nMetadata within e-learning\nThe development of interoperability standards and specifications within e-learning\nhas involved, in the main, software and courseware developers, content developers\nand, to a lesser extent, teachers. Information scientists and librarians, whose expertise\nlies precisely in the domain we are examining, were simultaneously developing meta-\ndata technologies (such as the Z39.50 search protocol), standards (such as MARC\nand Dublin Core metadata) and practice for web-based and other digital resources.\nFor a long time these two fields remained largely separate (McLean & Lynch, 2003)\nand opportunities to benefit from the experiences of the library and information\nscience community were often missed.\nConsequently, the metadata creation problem space has been elided within e-\nlearning. Downes (2001) stated in his seminal paper on the necessity for a learning\nobject economy: \nWhatever the properties, the authoring of metadata itself will be straightforward for most\ncourse designers. Because metadata files are machine-writable, authors will simply access\na form into which they enter the appropriate metadata information.\nThis statement encapsulates the (lack of) thinking in this area. IMS and IEEE, in\ntheir metadata specifications, have remained agnostic on the matter, offering no guid-\nance on how good quality metadata creation may be ensured (IEEE LTSC, 2002;\nIMS, 2001; IMS, 2003).\nWe suggest that there are four erroneous assumptions behind the absence of\ninquiry into how metadata should best be created within e-learning: \n\u0002 that, in the context of the culture of the Internet, mediation by controlling author-\nities is detrimental and undesirable;\n\u0002 that rigorous metadata creation is too time-consuming and costly, a barrier in an\narena where the supposed benefits include savings in time, effort and cost;\n\u0002 that only authors and\/or users of learning materials have the necessary knowledge\nor expertise to create metadata that will be meaningful to their colleagues; and\n\u0002 that, given a standard metadata structure, metadata content can be generated or\nresolved by machine.\nWe would also put forward a fifth underlying reason, garnered from conversations\nwith e-learning colleagues around the world: that for both technology and peda-\ngogy experts, metadata creation is seen as a tedious chore rather than as a complex\nintellectual skill which is essential for unlocking access to resources.\n Quality assurance for digital learning object repositories:\n \n9\n      However, standards-based learning object repositories are now being more widely\nimplemented and practical problems resulting from poor understanding of the meta-\ndata creation process are beginning to emerge. These experiences challenge the above\nassumptions and suggest that there is more to the creation of good metadata than\nsimply filling in a form.\nThree examples from the UK\nWe now summarise relevant findings from three UK repositories. They are presented\nin chronological order, to illustrate the development of understanding in the area of\nmetadata creation.\nThe Scottish electronic Staff Development Library (SeSDL) taxonomy evaluation\nSeSDL was a seminal project that, from 2000 to 2001, investigated the development\nof a learning object repository based on IMS specifications, including the IMS Learn-\ning Resource Meta-data specification (v1.1). Funded by SHEFC\u2019s ScotCIT\nprogramme and based at the Universities of Strathclyde, Edinburgh and Paisley, its\npurpose was to encourage the sharing and reuse of staff development materials within\nHE. The main subject focus was the use of C&IT in teaching and learning.\nIn planning this early repository, employing an information specialist was not\nconsidered. However, when it was discovered that no appropriate, readily available\nsubject classification scheme was available, a librarian was brought in to create the\nSeSDL Taxonomy. A small-scale peer evaluation of the taxonomy was carried out\n(Currier, 2001). This evaluation was not designed to test the proficiency of\nresource authors and users in creating metadata, although it did point to potential\nproblems in the specific area of subject metadata. The data gathered was complex\nand could no doubt yield more insight with further analysis; here we merely\nattempt to illustrate in a simple way the difficulties untrained users found in subject\nclassification.\nSix consultants drawn from the project\u2019s user community were provided with eight\nlearning objects to be classified using the taxonomy. The SeSDL team agreed upon\n\u2018ideal\u2019 classifications for the eight objects, against which the consultants\u2019 classifica-\ntions would be compared. The team provided as much structure and guidance for the\nevaluation exercise as possible, while not providing the consultants with training\nwhich would bring them too far beyond the skill level of the intended users of SeSDL.\nHowever, even with guidance notes, the ability of the consultants to understand\nand carry out the task varied considerably. One consultant commented in the post-\nevaluation focus group: \u201cThe whole exercise has given me more admiration and\nrespect for librarians\u201d (Currier, 2001).\nThe SeSDL team assigned a total of 35 classifications to the eight objects, averag-\ning about four classifications per object. In only one instance did all six consultants\nagree with one of the \u2018ideal\u2019 classifications. For five of the eight objects, up to half of\n 10\n \nS. Currier \n \net al.\n                   the \u2018ideal\u2019 classifications assigned were unused by any of the consultants. In all, only\nabout 50% of the \u2018ideal\u2019 classifications had the agreement of more than half the\nconsultants.\nA total of 71 \u2018non-ideal\u2019 classifications were assigned by the consultants, averaging\nabout nine per object. In only 15% of these cases did more than one consultant agree\nupon the classification. Only five classifications (7%) had the agreement of three or\nmore consultants. Out of a total of 106 classifications assigned (including \u2018ideal\u2019\nclassifications), only 39 (35%) had the agreement of more than one consultant.\nThese figures indicate that users of SeSDL will assign a wide variety of classifica-\ntions to their objects and will do so inconsistently in comparison with each other. For\nexample (Currier, 2001), a learning object consisting of an HTML page defining the\nterms \u2018VLE\u2019 and \u2018MLE\u2019 was classified by one consultant as \u2018Student-Centred Learn-\ning\u2019 and \u2018Collaborative Learning\u2019. This appears to reflect their belief that a VLE or\nMLE should be used in a student-centred way, for collaborative learning. The impli-\ncation is that a repository user looking under \u2018Student-Centred Learning\u2019 in the\nbrowse tree would expect to find a learning object defining the term \u2018VLE\u2019 there.\nTables 1 and 2 show the variety of classifications assigned by all the consultants to\nthis object.\nIf the learning objects listed under a particular branch of the SeSDL browse tree\nappear to be randomly or inconsistently classified, this may well influence users\u2019 percep-\ntion of the quality of the repository as a whole and their willingness to keep searching.\nThe Evaluation Report (Currier, 2001) concluded with a number of recommenda-\ntions, the most pertinent of which relate to user support: \n\u0002 Explain what classification is for using simple, jargon-free language and examples.\n\u0002 Ensure users understand the availability of multiple classifications, with examples.\n\u0002 Suggest use of both the upload tool and a paper version of the taxonomy.\n\u0002 Provide a note-taking facility, or suggest that users take notes offline.\n\u0002 Suggest users look for other objects of a similar subject to theirs and note the clas-\nsifications that have been assigned.\n\u0002 Provide a tutorial in classifying objects, designed to lessen the main barriers to\neffective classification as highlighted in the evaluation.\n\u0002 Make alternative terms visible within the upload tool, to assist with understanding\nthe scope of the classifications.\n\u0002 Provide scope notes for classifications where appropriate.\n\u0002 Add more \u2018See Also\u2019 notes and allow these to be seen within the upload tool. Either\ninclude links or automatically bring up the terms referred to.\nSeSDL was a project with a finite lifespan; no ongoing funding was available to\nimplement any of these recommendations. However, its experiences have informed\nsubsequent developments worldwide. Perhaps the most pertinent to this enquiry is\nthe final point made in the evaluation (Currier, 2001): \nHow can online resource provision services which expect their users to classify their own\nresources best support this so that future users will be able to find what they want? Or is\nthis approach ultimately inadvisable?\n Quality assurance for digital learning object repositories:\n \n11\n   The Bolton Woods Local History Project\nBolton Woods Community Centre is a UK-Online centre offering C&IT facilities to\nthe local community. Since 1998 it has been a part of community networking project,\nShipley Communities Online, which is a partnership offering online learning, occu-\npational guidance services and information and advice on training and work\nopportunities.\nIn the Centre\u2019s Bolton Woods Local History Project, members of the community\ncreate digital resources, mainly family and local history materials, which are shared\nwith their peers for use as informal learning resources. Under the Metadata for\nCommunity Content project, a network of community projects, including Shipley\nCommunities Online, were provided with a small repository so learning materials\ncould be shared on a peer-to-peer basis with other communities. Metadata for the\nresources was required to facilitate this sharing.\nTable 2.

Currier \n \net al.\n           Faced with the challenge of creating metadata for a range of materials, the project\ndecided to use the available labour. It became apparent early on that the process of\nmetadata development was one that merited closer attention, so a small study was\ncarried out to investigate whether the creators of resources could also create their own\nmetadata and to compare their ability with information specialists.\nDublin Core metadata was used, with some additional educational elements added\nfor resources used to construct learning pathways (e.g. \u2018AudienceLevel\u2019 and \u2018Typical-\nLearningTime\u2019). This proved to be particularly problematic as neither resource\ncreators nor librarians had the pedagogical expertise either to create learning path-\nways or assign educational metadata.\nFour local history enthusiasts with fairly high-level website design skills created\ncommunity resources for the project and were given the task of creating metadata for\ntheir resources. Two qualified librarians working on the project were asked to assign\nmetadata to similar resources. Brief guidance notes were provided, although a meta-\ndata tool was not used. Instead, DreamWeaver was employed, as this was familiar to\nthe resource authors taking part.\nThe study involved another librarian involved in the project observing the efforts of\nboth groups in creating metadata and assigning a subjective score out of five in five\nkey areas of managing metadata: understanding metadata; context of resources;\nchoosing elements; assigning values; and subject classification. The findings were: \n\u0002 resource creators did not have a good understanding of the purpose of metadata or\nan appreciation of its value;\n\u0002 resource creators did understand the context of their resources and focused on\nthese elements within the metadata;\n\u0002 information specialists had a better understanding of the purpose of metadata and\nincluded a wider range of metadata elements;\n\u0002 information specialists struggled with contextual aspects of the metadata;\n\u0002 neither the resource creators nor the information specialists handled pedagogic\naspects of the resources well.\nTable 3 shows the scores gained by the two groups.\nThe greatest difficulty arose from content creators\u2019 lack of understanding of the\nrationale for assigning metadata (cf. case three, below). The metaphor of finding a\nbook in a library was useful in explaining its purpose.\nTable 3. Comparative assessment of success in creating metadata\nActivity\nInformation specialists Score \nout of 5\nContent creators Score out \nof 5\nUnderstanding 3 1\nContext of resources 1 4\nChoosing elements 4 1\nAssigning values 4 4\nClassification 4 2\n Quality assurance for digital learning object repositories:\n \n13\n     Specific issues included the content creators\u2019 difficulty with the \u2018Relation\u2019 element,\nwhich allows, for instance, a resource to be specified as part of another resource. The\n\u2018Rights\u2019 element also highlighted problems in understanding IPR issues. Subject clas-\nsification was particularly difficult for content creators to understand, echoing the\nfindings of the SeSDL case study above.\nThese findings suggest that a collaborative approach may yield the best results in\nterms of metadata quality, since it would engage the strengths of both groups. This\nsmall study resulted in an improved approach for the project, involving closer collab-\noration between content creators and metadata specialists. Because neither the\ncontent authors nor the librarians were educational professionals, it was noted that\nfurther improvement might be facilitated through the involvement of this third group,\nand that a future study investigating this may be useful.\nThe Higher Level Skills for Industry repository (HLSI)\nThe HLSI project is developing a repository for digital learning objects to support the\ndelivery of learning programmes over a wide curriculum area from GCSE to Higher\nEducation. An ongoing development, the project has both fed into and drawn from\nthe development of this paper over the past year. As such, the issues raised and\nmeasures taken within HLSI to overcome problems are of great interest and represent\na significant potential base for future research.\nBased at the University of Huddersfield and funded by local development\nagency Yorkshire Forward, the project involves 35 partner organisations, with over\n300 members of staff actively participating. Learning objects are uploaded to the\nrepository by their authors (generally educational practitioners); they are intended\nto be shared and reused in e-learning environments across the partnership.\nBy February 2003, the repository had gathered approximately 6500 learning\nobjects from the initial 12 partner organizations, in a variety of sizes and file formats,\ntogether with author-generated IEEE LOM v.1.0 metadata records: \nThe people who submitted resources also provide the metadata, which gives them some\nownership over the records. The drawback is that the quality of metadata varies. (Barker\n& Ryan, 2003)\nClearly, in the early stages of the project, there was an assumption that authors who\nsubmit resources want \u2018ownership\u2019 of the metadata records. This is interesting in light\nof our initial assumptions and may warrant further investigation, although there was\na shift around this issue later in the project.\nThe problem of metadata quality is explained further (Barker & Ryan, 2003): \nThe difficulty with this process is making sure the authors understand the purpose of the\nmetadata and the methodology used to enter it. A balance had to be struck between getting\nhigh quality metadata and not going above the skill level of those entering the metadata.\nAt the moment there is quite a large variation in the quality of metadata for the\nresources. For example some have spelling errors. This affects the performance [of the]\nrepository so several steps are being taken to improve the process.\n 14\n \nS. Currier \n \net al.\n         As shown in Table 4, an evaluation of the metadata records at that time showed that\nnearly half (46%) of the metadata records were of poor quality or unusable\nSpecific problems beyond spelling errors were specifically delineated by Ryan &\nWalmsley (2003): \n\u0002 A single metadata record was duplicated, unchanged, for many or all components\nof a package of educational content.\n\u0002 The terminology used by the metadata authors was not consistent.\n\u0002 Some metadata authors described the facets and characteristics of the educational\nobject and not its content, e.g. describing a Flash file about internal combustion as\n\u2018Flash file\u2019 instead of \u2018internal combustion\u2019.\n\u0002 The metadata tool allowed default values for certain fields and these were used\ninappropriately.\nSteps for improving the process have now been under way for some months. Initial\nmeasures involved providing more user support through education and documenta-\ntion and employing a team of information science professionals to improve the exist-\ning metadata (Ryan, 2003). Ryan (2003) noted that, by June 2003, 2500 metadata\nrecords had been re-edited, taking about 550 hours and costing around \u00a36500 (about\n\u00a32.60 per record). Subsequently, the partnership expanded and the project now has\naccess to a large number of information science professionals who have adopted the\nmetadata problem and are actively driving improvements forward.\nThe process of metadata collection has now been split into two stages: \n1. The educational practitioner is responsible for entering basic metadata, including\ntitle, description, contribution and any technical information they may be aware\nof.\n2. The information scientist is responsible for reviewing the basic metadata and\nproviding additional metadata for subject classification, educational attributes,\netc.\nThis process was created by a group of partners in one of the sub-regions covered by\nthe project; it is now being adopted and actively promoted to the whole partnership,\nsupported by continuous staff development and training.\nThe information scientists also made a number of comments, suggestions and\nrecommendations that have resulted in new development areas for the project. These\ninclude providing: \nTable 4. Metadata quality in the HLSI project prior to intervention\nMetadata quality % of metadata records\nGood 28\nModerate 26\nPoor 32\nUnusable 14\n Quality assurance for digital learning object repositories:\n \n15\n                   \u0002 spell-checking facilities within the metadata tool;\n\u0002 functionality for browsing and searching authority lists (centralized coordination of\nforms of authors\u2019 names, for instance) when reviewing and entering advanced\nmetadata;\n\u0002 a clear separation between basic and advanced metadata, with restricted access to\nthe advanced metadata;\n\u0002 an on-line thesaurus to support advanced metadata entry;\n\u0002 updated terminology and option lists to reflect current practice; and\n\u0002 functionality to record\/report\/track the review status of metadata records.\nThese new development areas represent a significant amount of work and reflect the\nproject\u2019s change in emphasis from a purely technical implementation of specifications\nand standards to a more focused approach on addressing a significant problem. The\ncreation of the two-stage process also led to a change in the conception of ownership\nof metadata records and the responsibility and authority for their quality, without\nremoving the need for the resource author\u2019s own expertise.\nSpecific metadata issues\nIf the proposed learning object economy bears fruit, we may anticipate repositories\nand networks holding large collections of tens of thousands of learning objects or\nmore. The above case studies highlight a number of areas where quality of the meta-\ndata may impact on the discovery of resources in this economy, which are expanded\non below.\nError management\nThe HLSI case study, with its large numbers of records, found that the issue of errors\nwas significant in their repository. The following quote illustrates (amusingly) a\npotentially serious problem facing resource discovery. It touches on motivation and\nsupport for metadata creation by untrained resource authors, and on the necessity for\nchecking of metadata, whoever it is created by: \nEven when there\u2019s a positive benefit to creating good metadata, people steadfastly refuse\nto exercise care and diligence in their metadata creation. Take eBay: every seller there has\na damned good reason for double-checking their listings for typos and misspellings. Try\nsearching for \u201cplam\u201d on eBay. Right now, that turns up nine typoed listings for \u201cPlam\nPilots\u201d. Misspelled listings don\u2019t show up in correctly spelled searches and hence garner\nfewer bids and lower sale-prices. You can almost always get a bargain on a Plam Pilot at\neBay. (Doctorow, 2002)\nAuthors\u2019 and other contributors\u2019 names: authority control\nAn obvious example among a multitude of permutations is that of an author\u2019s name\nchanging when they get married. In this and similar cases, a search by name cannot\nretrieve everything by that person unless there is some kind of name management.\n 16\n \nS. Currier \n \net al.\n          Libraries, archives and museums solve this problem by using centralised name\nauthority records, a time consuming and costly exercise. This also applies to names\nof institutions, conferences, etc.\nHowever, bibliographic indexing services have traditionally not done this, instead\nrelying on the author\u2019s name and subject area to do a \u2018good enough\u2019 job. There is no\nevidence either way for a viable approach for learning object repositories. This is one\narea where research into how users will search would be useful.\nSubject area\nThis is one of the most complex areas of both metadata creation and resource discov-\nery; there is insufficient space to cover it in depth here. All three case studies showed\nsignificant problems when untrained authors attempted to create subject metadata.\nThere are two main ways in which subject access to resources is provided via\nmetadata (as opposed to free text searching): indexing (e.g. key words) and classifi-\ncation. How may this difficult and complex task best be carried out for maximum\nresource discoverability by a heterogeneous population of searchers? Should the\nresource author, who may know their subject area and its terminology well, create the\nsubject metadata? Or should it be a metadata specialist, who may know the specific\narea less well, but may be better placed to step back and think about all the potential\nusers of a resource, and about consistency of key words and classifications across a\nrepository or network?\nEducational metadata\nIt is commonly thought within e-learning that authors are best placed to create educa-\ntional metadata. The Bolton Woods case study suggests that those with educational\nexpertise should be involved in this area, where authors themselves do not have\nsuch expertise. Nevertheless, there are many successful examples of professional\ncataloguing of specialised materials, such as music or photographs, so it is possible\nthat a new sub-speciality of metadata experts could emerge in this area.\nAccessibility metadata\nWith the new SENDA (Special Educational Needs and Disability Act, 2001) legislation\nin the UK there has been some interesting recent work around developing metadata\nto describe the accessibility properties of a resource. However, this may prove\nproblematic for metadata creators who are not experts in accessibility.\nWho creates metadata and how?\nThere is much discussion in e-learning concerning the barriers to uptake of reusable\nlearning objects, often focusing on teachers\u2019 unwillingness to engage in the vaunted\nlearning object economy. IPR and the \u2018not invented here syndrome\u2019 are often quoted\n Quality assurance for digital learning object repositories:\n \n17as significant hurdles. However, how much of a barrier is the task of having to create\nmetadata when uploading a resource, particularly with poorly designed tools? More-\nover, how much of a barrier will it be for teachers searching for resources, if metadata\nis of such poor quality that they cannot find what they need?\nIn this section we outline some possible permutations of how metadata may be\ncreated and by whom. The task of creating metadata may be divided into two stages:\nthe gathering and recording of the information and the expression of that information\nas conformant metadata. For example, in recording the names of contributors to a\nresource, a metadata creator may note illustrators, the authors of any text, any insti-\ntutions that took part, and perhaps an editor. They may then check the cataloguing\nguidelines of their repository and enter this data in a way that conforms to the guide-\nlines. For an experienced metadata creator, these stages may happen simultaneously,\nbut it is an important distinction in deciding how metadata tasks may be allocated.\nWe suggest the following three models for creating metadata: resource author or\ncontributor only; metadata specialist only; and collaborative.\nIn the first case, the design of metadata tools and user support and training take on\na greater weight in terms of quality assurance. Metadata quality in all five of the\nabove-named specific metadata issues may be impacted by inadequate provision here.\nIn the second case, the trained metadata specialist carrying out the task may be\nhampered by lack of knowledge about the pedagogical context, history or subject area\nof the resource, as shown in the Bolton Woods case study.\nWithin a collaborative model there are a number of possible scenarios. For\ninstance, the author may enter data in certain fields (as in the HLSI case), such as\ntheir own name, resource title, institution, educational fields, etc. The metadata\nspecialist may check these for accuracy and conformance and add other selected fields\nsuch as subject classification, keywords and accessibility information. This process\nmay be truly collaborative, with the parties communicating directly, or they may work\nseparately, perhaps with the specialist periodically checking records in bulk. In both\nthe Bolton Woods case and the HLSI case, a collaborative method of metadata\ncreation was chosen after practical experience of the difficulties in taking either the\nfirst or second approach. Both repositories reported improvements as a result.\nThere are various communities that have a body of research and experience to draw\nupon in examining some of these issues. The most obvious is library and information\nscience, with an abundance of relevant peer reviewed journals and conferences. The\narchive and museum communities may also have something to contribute; for\ninstance, the metadata in museum object records is considered to contain a large\nportion of a curator\u2019s academic knowledge and research (Zorich, 1991). Commercial\nabstracting and indexing database services have long utilised author-generated meta-\ndata, requiring authors to submit abstracts and keywords with papers. Research in\nthis field has found that authors \u201cmay lack knowledge of indexing and cataloguing\nprinciples and practices, and are more likely to generate insufficient and poor quality\nmetadata that may hamper resource discovery\u201d (Greenberg & Robertson, 2002).\nThere has been one formal information science study so far on the issue of author\ngenerated and collaborative metadata (Greenberg & Robertson, 2002), which looked\n 18\n \nS. Currier \n \net al.\n               at this with regard to Dublin Core metadata in support of the Semantic Web, a devel-\nopment which aims to bring structured knowledge representation to the web\u2019s mean-\ningful content. This study concluded that: \n\u2026 the integration of expert and author generated descriptive metadata can advance and\nimprove the quality of metadata for web content, which in turn could provide useful data\nfor intelligent web agents, ultimately supporting the development of the Semantic Web.\n[\u2026] If such partnerships are well planned and evaluated, they could make a significant\ncontribution to achieving the Semantic Web.\nConclusions: issues for research\nAnalysis of the studies above enables several areas to be identified where focused\ninvestigation would produce useful information for decision making by developers\nand managers of repositories: \n\u0002 What are the important cultural factors that may influence the e-learning commu-\nnity\u2019s particular approach to metadata creation? For example, is \u2018ownership\u2019 of\nmetadata by resource authors important? If so, how may this need best be met? In\nthe HLSI case, there was a tradeoff between perceived ownership of metadata by\nresource authors and the quality of the completed metadata. Further research as\nthis repository progresses may shed more light on optimum management of this\nbalancing act.\n\u0002 What constitutes good quality metadata, within individual repositories and within\nthe global networked environment? For example, to what extent does metadata\nthat is \u2018good enough\u2019 for local purposes also support effective retrieval by remote\nusers operating in a different contextual setting? Can a set of \u2018metadata metrics\u2019 be\nagreed within communities and beyond?\n\u0002 Who is best placed to create the metadata in any given context? For example, to\nwhat extent does the type of metadata (subject metadata, educational metadata,\netc.) have a bearing? Is a collaborative approach to metadata creation the best way\nforward? Since the evidence presented suggest that this is the case, how can this\napproach be managed effectively?\n\u0002 How can tools be used to facilitate the metadata creation process and how much\neffect do they have? The HLSI repository improved their tool design as part of a\nprogramme of improving metadata quality, while the SeSDL Taxonomy Evalua-\ntion stated that tool design will be vital if resource depositors are to create their own\nmetadata. So how can the design of tools encourage the creation of good quality\nmetadata, whoever is creating it?\n\u0002 To what extent can the provision of guidelines and training improve metadata\ncreation? For example, can information specialists provide adequate guidelines to\nenable non-specialists to use a taxonomy effectively? Can librarians be trained to\ncreate good quality educational metadata?\n\u0002 What are the costs and benefits associated with the various approaches to metadata\ncreation? For example, are savings at the initial metadata creation stage eroded by\nsubsequent costs such as data cleaning? The HLSI case would suggest this is the\n Quality assurance for digital learning object repositories:\n \n19\n                    case. In addition, does reducing metadata costs within a repository simply increase\nthe cost, in terms of time and effort, to the end user?\n\u0002 How will users search for materials within learning object repositories and\nnetworks? For example, how important is it to have authority control over the\nnames of authors and contributing institutions? What educational attributes will\nusers search for and how? Answers to these questions will have a profound impact\non decisions about metadata creation.\nThe evidence presented here suggests that a collaborative approach to metadata\ncreation may be necessary, and that good design of processes and tools is important.\nHowever, further research needs to be done on specific implementation of these\napproaches. Other issues have been raised, with no clear answers; particularly impor-\ntant is how end users will search repositories. What is clear is that there is work to be\ndone before the e-learning community has a good understanding of the issues\nsurrounding metadata creation, such that effective policies and practices can be put\nin place to assure the quality of metadata and hence the ability of teachers and\nlearners to access resources.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the following colleagues for their contributions to\nthis paper: Phil Barker; Lorna M.
