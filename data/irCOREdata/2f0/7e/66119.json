However, until recently biaxiality has remained elusive\nfor thermotropic nematogens. A large variety of synthetic\nstrategies have been employed to engineer new molecules,\nwhich could potentially exhibit orientational order along\ntwo perpendicular axes [4\u20137]. Although each strategy\nshowed some merit, none of these succeeded in producing\na verifiable biaxial phase. Recently this situation changed\nwith both Madsen et al. [8] and Acharya et al. [9] reporting\nstrong experimental evidence to have discovered the first\nbiaxial phase in low molecular weight thermotropic liquid\ncrystals based on molecules with an oxadiazole core\n(Fig. 1). These molecules are neither calamitic (rodlike)\nnor discotic (disclike) but belong to a third group of\nthermotropic mesogens known as bend-core mesogens\n[10]. Earlier theoretical work had predicted that bent-\ncore systems could form mesophases [11]. However, the\nbend angle of the oxadiazole systems does not correspond\nto that predicted by theory, and at this stage it is not\npossible to attribute biaxial ordering in oxadiazole meso-\ngens purely to molecular shape. It should also be noted that\nexperiments to characterize the biaxial nematic phase fur-\nther are not easy, since it is found to be stable only at high\ntemperatures, which makes analysis difficult [8].\nThis Letter aims at analyzing the reported biaxial liquid\ncrystalline phase of ODBP-Ph-C7 (Fig. 1) using an atom-\nistic simulation approach for the molecule and investigat-\ning the forces responsible for its formation. Simulation\nallows us to observe the evolution of the biaxial phase\nand study the structure of the phase itself at a molecular\nlevel.\nResults are obtained from classical molecular dynamics\nsimulations carried out with 256 molecules in a cubic\nsimulation box at five state points corresponding to tem-\nperatures assigned experimentally to lie within the biaxial\nnematic region: 448, 458, 468, 478, and 488 K. The\ncalculations use an all-atom molecular dynamics simula-\ntion approach adopting the same methodology outlined in\nfull in previous studies of the mesogen PCH5 [12,13]. In\nbrief, the simulations used a harmonic force field of the\nOPLS-AA form obtained from a combination of ab initio\nquantum calculations to parametrize internal degrees of\nfreedom and small molecule simulations to refine parame-\nters for nonbonded terms [14,15]; employed partial elec-\ntronic charges with an Ewald sum treatment of electro-\nstatics; made use of the SHAKE procedure to constrain\nbond lengths with a time step of 2 fs; and were carried out\nin the constant-NpT ensemble using a Nose\u00b4-Hoover ther-\nmostat and a Hoover barostat coupled to a leap frog inte-\ngrator. Simulations were started from an idealized per-\nfectly aligned pseudonematic starting configuration with\nperfect order (Q200 \u0004 hS2i \u0005 1, Q222 \u0005 1) at a gas phase\ndensity, compressed rapidly to liquid state density and\nequilibrated at a pressure of 1 bar. Additional simulations\nwere started from an isotropic configuration with Q200 \u0004\nhS2i \u0005 0 at gas phase density. This was also compressed\nrapidly to liquid phase density and equilibrated to form an\nisotropic liquid phase.\nThe molecular orientation was calculated on the basis of\nthree different criteria: (a) orthogonal vectors representing\nthe three principal inertia axes of the molecule were ob-\ntained by diagonalizing the inertia tensor; (b) three or-\nthogonal vectors were obtained from the central\noxidazole ring, with the ring long axis pointing along the\nnitrogen-nitrogen vector and the short axis pointing along\n \nN N\nO\nOOC C\nO O\nC7H15C7H15\n446 K 439 K 421 K495 KI N SmC SmX K\nFIG. 1.

Here we\ndefine the arm vectors in terms of (i) the oxidiazole ring\nonly, (ii) the central oxidiazole ring plus secondary phenyl\nrings, (iii) the whole core plus chains. The results described\nbelow are found to be largely independent of which set of\nthree vectors are used for analysis, indicating that biaxial\nordering of the core is similar to that of the molecule as a\nwhole. For brevity, results presented below are given only\nfor set (a) and (c)(ii).\nThe director vectors, X, Y, and Z, for the three ordering\ndirections of a system of biaxial molecules can be assigned\nto the eigenvectors obtained by diagonalizing three uniax-\nial ordering second rank tensors, QAA\u0001\u0002 [16] constructed\nfrom the three molecular axes (A \u0004 X, Y, Z) defined above.\nBy convention, Z, is defined as the director parallel to the\naverage direction of the long molecular axes and the uni-\naxial order parameter for the long axis, hSZZ2 i is given by\n hSZZ2 i \u0004 Q200 \u0004 hZQzzZi; (1)\nY is taken as the short axes defined above and hSYY2 i refers\nto the uniaxial order parameter for this axis. Following\nAllen [16] we also calculate the biaxial order parameter for\nthe system using X, Y, and Z\n Q222 \u0004\n1\n3\nhXQxxX\u0006 YQyyY \u0003 XQyyX\u0003 YQxxYi: (2)\nThe order parameters for the system grown from a\nperfectly aligned nematic are shown in the top part of\nFig. 2 for the midtemperature of 468 K. Here, loss of the\ninitial perfect biaxial order occurs very rapidly within\n<1:0 ns on cooling from the aligned gas to the nematic.\nHowever, considerably longer ( > 6 ns) is allowed for the\nsystem to equilibrate. In Table I we give the mean values\nfor each order parameter calculated from the final 3.5 ns of\nsimulation for 5 temperatures. The system is seen to re-\nmain nematic and biaxial between 448 and 488 K, which\ncovers the experimental range where biaxiality has been\nreported [8,9], with order parameters decreasing slightly as\ntemperature is increased over this range. The measured\nbiaxiality is small but sufficiently high to indicate a small\ndegree of orientational order for the short axis within the\nphase. The fact that the values of hSZZ2 i, hSYY2 i, and hQ222i do\nnot depend significantly on the definition of the axes in\nTable I suggests that the biaxiality of the core is imposed\non the molecule as a whole.\nIt should be stressed that the values for Q222 are <0:2 in\nall cases. Such values are smaller than expected from\nprevious simulations of idealized models for biaxial mole-\ncules. For example, single site biaxial potentials, such as\nspheroids [16] and a biaxial Gay-Berne [17], predict a\nnematic range where the biaxial order parameter rises to\n>0:6 and >0:25, respectively. In the case of the latter the\nbiaxiality is limited by the onset of smectic ordering. For\nthe current molecule a smaller degree of biaxiality is\nexpected from the deuterium NMR results of Madsen\net al. [8]. Also, for a limited system size of 256 molecules,\nwe would expect some degree of system size dependence\nof the results, i.e., local biaxial fluctuations would be\nexpected to contribute to hSYY2 i and hQ222i. We cannot test\nthe extent of this effect by going to larger system sizes, as\n256 molecules already represent an extremely large system\nto simulate over periods of >10 ns. However, we are able\nto compare with values for these order parameters for a\nknown uniaxial system: for 256 molecules of the uniaxial\nnematic mixture, E7, where the current authors have re-\n \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 20 40 60\nTime\/ns\nO\nrd\ne\nr \nPa\nra\nm\ne\nte\nr\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n0 5 10\nTime\/ns\nO\nrd\ne\nr \nPa\nra\nm\net\ner\nFIG. 2.

The value of\nhSYY2 i \u0004 0:2\u0007 0:02 for E7 is comparable to that seen in\nthis work, while the value of hQ222i \u0004 0:06\u0007 0:03 is\nclearly considerably less. Here, however, we can deduce\nthat the relatively large value of hSYY2 i for the E7 simulation\nis solely down to local biaxial fluctuations in a small\nsystem. For example, if we monitor the direction of the\nshort-axis director in E7 we see quite rapid fluctuations in\nthe direction of this vector. This contrasts with relatively\nslow diffusion of a well-defined short-axis director in\nODBP-Ph-C7.\nBates and Luckhurst [19] have suggested that an alter-\nnative way of quantifying the degree of biaxial ordering is\nby the biaxial parameter \u0003. Here, \u0003 \u0004 \u0001qyy \u0003 qxx\u0002=qzz,\nwhere jqzzj> jqyyj> jqxxj for eigenvalues of the ordering\ntensor of a chosen axis. For ODBP-Ph-C7, the ordering\ntensor for the long molecular (inertia) axes at 468 K yields\na value of \u0003 \u0004 0:16\u0007 0:04, whereas for E7 the value of \u0003\nis 0:03\u0007 0:02. With this evidence, it seems quite clear that\nthe orientational order in ODBP-Ph-C7, although small, is\nfundamentally different to that in a uniaxial liquid crystal\nwith local biaxial fluctuations. Madsen et al. [8] have\nmeasured a value of \u0003 in their NMR study by using\nquadrupolar splitting from a probe molecule of hexame-\nthylbenzene dissolved in ODBP-Ph-C7. In their work a\nvalue of \u0003 of 0.11 is measured. This measurement arises\nfrom the biaxial ordering of the probe molecule within the\nphase itself. We would expect a slightly higher phase\nbiaxiality from the actual ODBP-Ph-C7 molecules. As\nnoted in [19], \u0003 values are expected to depend on the\naxis chosen within the molecule. In our work, larger values\nof \u0003 are available if other axes are chosen, e.g., a value of\n\u0003 \u0004 0:3\u0007 0:1 is measured for the short axis at 468 K.\nTurning to the interactions responsible for biaxiality, it\nhas been suggested that the dipole across the center of the\noxadiazole ring is important in stabilizing a biaxial phase.\nTo this end it is interesting to note the formation of small\nferroelectrically ordered domains in the sample. These are\nshown clearly in Fig. 3, where the color coding shows\ndomains where the central dipoles are aligned. A more\nquantitative measure of this is provided by calculating the\ndistance dependent pairwise dipole correlation function,\ng1\u0001r\u0002 \u0004 hcos\u0004\u0001r\u0002iji, averaged over all molecular pairs i and\nj at a separation r for angles \u0004ij between the short molecu-\nlar axes (Fig. 4). Here, distances are measured relative to\nthe center of the oxadiazole ring. The peak in g1\u0001r\u0002 be-\ntween \u0005 4:2\u201314:6 \u0001A indicates a preference for a parallel\narrangement of the core dipoles at these distances. [The\nsharp negative signal in g1\u0001r\u0002 over a very small range of r\nat \u00053:3 \u0001A occurs because two cores with parallel dipoles\ncannot approach this close without unfavorable steric\nrepulsion.]\nTo test whether the small ferroelectric domains arise\nfrom preferential packing of the core or from electro-\nstatics, we carried out additional simulations in which\npartial charges were removed from the system for further\nsimulations at 468 K. The immediate influence of the\nremoval of charges is a slight stabilization of the nematic\nphase, with the uniaxial order parameter from the long\ninertia axis increasing slightly to 0.8; accompanied by a\ndecrease in hQ222i to 0.07 and a decrease in \u0003 for the long\naxis to 0.03. The change in density accompanying the\nremoval of charges is very small <0:1% (from 1.049 to\n1:048 g cm\u00033). As shown in Fig. 4 the reduction in biax-\niality is associated with a destabilization of the ferroelec-\ntric domains. It therefore seems likely that ferroelectric\nparallel alignment of the cores helps in the stabilization of\nthe biaxial nematic in ODBP-Ph-C7. Possibly this is due to\nfavorable quadrupolar stacking of the molecular cores.\nReintroduction of the charges leads to a recovery of the\noriginal domains and order parameters over a 8 ns period.\nIn recent experimental work, Go\u00a8rtz and Goodby have\nreported that oxidiazole compounds can show interesting\nbehavior with the formation of chiral domains of opposite\nhandedness, as seen via optical microscopy [20]. We have\ntherefore carried out extended simulations to study the\n \nFIG. 3 (color online). Snapshot from a molecular dynamics\nsimulation of the ODBP-Ph-C7 at 468 K.

The time evolution of the order parameters\nfrom this simulation is shown in Fig. 2. Here, growth of a\nliquid crystalline mesophase takes place over approxi-\nmately 50 ns, (corresponding to approximately 12 CPU\nyears on our parallel opteron computer system used for this\nwork). To our knowledge this is the first time growth of a\nliquid crystal phase has been achieved for an all-atom\nliquid crystal model. The time scale for the orientational\ntransition is very similar to that seen in the work of Berardi\net al. who considered the orientational melting of a nematic\nto an isotropic phase close to the clearing point [21]; and is\nconsiderably longer than that required for united-atom [22]\nor coarse-grained simulation models [23]. The value of\nhSZZ2 i at the end of the run are typical of those expected\nexperimentally for a nematic system. Viewing the snapshot\nin Fig. 3 shows that the phase has formed into two distinct\nferroelectric domains in quenching. For this simulation,\nboth hQ222i and \u0003 are larger than seen in the earlier runs,\nrespectively, 0:15\u0007 0:05 and 0:29\u0007 0:04 and these are\nclearly influenced by the size of the domains that are\nformed.\nIn Fig. 3 we note that the limited system size means that\nit is impossible to completely rule out formation of tilted\nsmectic layers rather than nematic domains. However, the\nvalue of the order parameter is typical for a nematic, the\nsystem remains fluid with molecules moving and continu-\nally changing conformation, and there is no well-defined\ntilt direction within the domains, which we might expect if\nwe had a tilted smectic. Go\u00a8rtz and Goodby suggested [20]\nthat an achiral biaxial nematic can separate into two sepa-\nrate chiral domains. To test for this in the simulation results\nwe have calculated the chirality for each molecule by\nmeans of the scaled chirality index, G0S [24]. Although\nindividual molecular conformations are strongly chiral, the\noverall chirality cancels out through conformational aver-\naging. Within the simulation error bars we can detect no\ndifference in the chirality for the two domains formed. It\nshould be stressed, of course, that the two domains seen\nhere are limited by the size of the simulation box,\n\u0005\u000164 \u0001A\u00023, which is very small compared to the domains\nseen experimentally.\nSummary.\u2014We have simulated the nematic phase of the\nmolecule ODBP-Ph-C7 at an all-atom simulation level for\n256 molecules. The results show that the degree of biax-\niality is small in this molecule as measured by the biaxial\norder parameter hQ222i. However, we find that the biaxiality\nseen in this system is genuine and fundamentally different\nfrom the local biaxial fluctuations that arise in uniaxial\nsystems. This is highlighted by comparisons of hQ222i and\nthe phase biaxiality \u0003 from simulations of the uniaxial\nmixture, E7. The discovery of ferroelectric domains in\nthis system is a surprising result. On removal of electronic\ncharges these domains are destabilized, with a correspond-\ning drop in the biaxial order parameter but a rise in the\nuniaxal order of the long axis. The final simulations where\ntwo domains are grown during a quench from the isotropic\nliquid phase are the first to show the growth of a mesophase\nfrom an isotropic liquid for an all-atom model.\nThe authors wish to thank the HEFCE and the University\nof Durham for funding computers through SRIF II; EPSRC\nfor providing financial support for J.
