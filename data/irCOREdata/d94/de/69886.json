Peyton \nThe input capacitance of transimpedance amplifiers can limit their \nresponse time. One novel technique based on a shunt bootstrap \nmethod is shown to be of advantage to op-amp based circuits \nwith a high transimpedance gain. \nIntroduction: Transimpedance amplifiers using voltage feedback \nop-amps are widely used in applications when a moderatehigh \nbandwidth and a high sensitivity are required, such as photodi- \nodes, photomultipliers, electron multipliers and capacitive sensors. \nThe conventional circuit, outlined in Fig. 1, presents a virtual \nearth and thus almost zero load impedance to the current source. \nAt high frequencies and especially for high gain circuits, the total \ninput capacitance CA can severely limit the available bandwidth \nfrom the circuit [l] or even cause a lightly dampediunstable \ndynamic response. A simple expression for the transimpedance \ngain of the circuit can be readily derived by assuming that the \nsource resistance R, is infinite and that the op-amp has a single \npole transfer function (pole frequency a,, and DC gain of A\"): \n-z.Rf \nsz(C,+C ) R  (C\"+C,)R, \nU ,  = \nA,,waf +s(c.fRffk+ A ,  \n(1) \n0 C = 100pF, C = OpF \nC f  = 100pF, C$= 2.8pF \n0 C, = OpF, C, = OpF \nUsing eqn. 1, typical plots are also shown in Fig. I ,  with R, = \n1MQ C, = 100pF,f, = 40% andf, = 4MHz. With no feedback \ncapacitance C, the response has a resonant peak as a direct conse- \nquence of the source capacitance. This peak represents a lightly \ndamped or unstable dynamic response. Lag compensation by \nintroducing feedback capacitance (q  = 2.8pF) can be used to give \na critically damped frequency response. However, this approach \ndoes not permit the full gain-bandwidth characteristic of the op- \namp to be fully exploited. An effective reduction in source capaci- \ntance results in less feedback capacitance being required to obtain \na critically damped response. The limit case, with C, = C, = 0, is \nalso plotted. \nELECTRONICS LETTERS 4th March 7999 Vol. 35 No. 5 369 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

Restrictions apply.\nBootstrap approach: Bootstrapping techniques for reducing the \ninput capacitance have been previously reported [2, 31 and several \npapers have described successful examples of transimpedance cir- \ncuits using series bootstrapping [4]. The basic bootstrapping prin- \nciple is to use an additional buffer amplifier to actively charge and \ndischarge to the input capacitance as required. Consequently, the \neffective source capacitance is reduced, enabling the overall band- \nwidth of the circuit to be increased. There are four possible boot- \nstrap configurations (series or shunt bootstrapping modes, with \neither floating or grounded sources) which can be applied to the \nbasic circuit. Previous published techniques have employed only \nthe series technique, for example in the case of a photodiode boot- \nstrapped by the source of the input FET [5, 61. In this Letter, we \nnow describe a successful application of the shunt approach. \nl \u2019 b i a s  \nShunt mode bootstrap; The bootstrap principle was applied to the \nphotodiode preamplifier circuit shown in Fig. 2, using an AC cou- \npled bootstrap path (C, = 47nF). The frequency responses of the \ncircuit with and without the bootstrap loop are compared in Fig. 2. \nw \nAn LF353N op-amp, 1MR feedback resistor and a large area \nphotodiode (type OSDl5-5T) were selected and the circuit was \ntested with an optical signal source. In the bootstrap circuit, the \nonly feedback capacitance required to produce a near critically \ndamped response was the parasitic capacitance possessed by the \nlayout and feedback resistor. Without the bootstrap loop the cir- \ncuit required an additional 1.8pF of feedback capacitance to give \na near critically damped response. It can be seen that the boot- \nstrap circuit has twice the bandwidth of the standard circuit. Also \nincluded in Fig. 2 are the theoretical critically damped frequency \nresponses of the two circuits using eqn. 1 and the small signal \ntransfer function for the bootstrap circuit given below in eqn. 2. \nTo obtain the small signal transfer function (eqn. 2) the source \nresistance was considered infinite and A1 and A2 were considered \nto be of the same type of op-amp with a single pole transfer func- \ntion (pole frequency o,, unity gain frequency CO, and DC gain of \nA,) giving \n(2) \n-i.Rf \n11, = \ncharacteristic equatiolz \nwhere the characteristic equation is \nbe attributed to this reduction in feedback capacitance, indicating \nthe effect of bootstrapping in effectively reducing the source \ncapacitance. Frequency responses for a range of op-amps and \nbootstrap circuits have been considered and these have been exten- \nsively compared to SPICE simulations with very good agreement. \nFinally, the step responses of the standard and bootstrap circuits \nare compared in Fig. 3. The mprovement in settling time can be \nclearly seen. The waveform at the output of A1 is included reveal- \ning the transients associated with the charge injection action of the \nbootstrap loop. It can be seen that the standard circuit requires \nadditional feedback capacitance in order to obtain a similarly \ndamped response to the bootstrap circuit. \n-U,=-* _m \nip -0.- C N \/ Q . .  -1- \nsco-cd \n-a \n..r 1-1 \n4 \nF \nI \nFig. 3 Step responses of bootstrap and standard circuits \n(i) Standard response with parasitic feedback capacitance only \n(ii) Standard response with parasitic + 1.8 pF feedback capacitance \n(iii) Bootstrap response with parasitic feedback capacitance only \n(iv) Output of bootstrap amplifier, AI \nConclusions: In this Letter we have presented a simple example of \na new shunt bootstrap amplifier based on two op-amps of the \nsame type and shows that the techniques can be used to realise a \nfaster response than is possible with a single op-amp alone. The \nbootstrap method may provide a viable design option for applica- \ntions with high gain (i.e. high RI) and requiring a wide bandwidth \n(where the bandwidth is limited by the parasitic effects of the \ninput capacitance). \n0 IEE 1999 \nElectronics Letters Online No: 19990290 \nDOI: 10.
