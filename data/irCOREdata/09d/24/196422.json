PLAUR is a key serine\nprotease receptor involved in the generation of plasmin and has been implicated in airway\nremodelling.\nPublished: 31 October 2009\nBMC Medical Genetics 2009, 10:112 doi:10.1186\/1471-2350-10-112\nReceived: 3 June 2009\nAccepted: 31 October 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/10\/112\n\u00a9 2009 Stewart et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Genetics 2009, 10:112 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/10\/112Background\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and\nasthma are complex respiratory diseases involving both\ngenetic and environmental factors (e.g. smoking exposure\nin COPD, allergen exposure in asthma) [1,2]. Using 587\nasthma families we have recently fine mapped a 14.4 Mb\nregion on Chromosome 19q13 and identified the uroki-\nnase plasminogen activator receptor (PLAUR, plasmino-\ngen activator receptor, urokinase type, alternative\nsymbols; UPAR and CD87) gene as an asthma susceptibil-\nity gene [3]. Importantly, we also demonstrated that pol-\nymorphisms spanning PLAUR predict decline in forced\nexpiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in asthma subjects\nand determine plasma PLAUR levels [3]. PLAUR plays a\nkey role in the formation of the serine protease plasmin by\ninteracting with urokinase plasminogen activator (PLAU)\n[4] and has been implicated in many processes including;\ncell differentiation, proliferation and migration [5]. Plas-\nminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2) regulate\nPLAUR activity [6].\nWhile asthma and COPD are distinct clinical entities, a\ncommon feature of both diseases is airway remodelling,\ni.e. deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the sub-\nmucosa, thickening of the reticularis and smooth muscle\nhyperplasia [7,8]. From the known biology of PLAUR, this\nprotease receptor is potentially involved in these processes\ndue to its role in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and\ntransforming growth factor (TGF)\u03b21 activation and tissue\nfibrosis [5].\nWhole genome linkage analyses using the Boston early\nonset COPD family cohort has identified linkage to chro-\nmosome 19q13 for FEV1, FVC and FEV1\/FVC, LOD 1.40\n(59 cM), 1.20 (101 cM), 1.47 (61 cM) respectively [9].\nTyping additional markers on 19q13 provided further\nsupport for this region i.e. FEV1 and FEV1\/FVC LOD 1.73\n(62 cM), 1.70 (62 cM) which was strengthened by selec-\ntion of former\/current smokers, LOD 3.30 (71 cM) and\n1.96 (63 cM) respectively [10]. The PLAUR gene is located\nat 67 cM and based on genetic and biological evidence\nmay be a COPD susceptibility gene. Smoking is associated\nwith an increased decline in FEV1 and is a major risk factor\nfor the development of COPD [11] therefore we investi-\ngated the role of PLAUR SNPs in smokers.\nThe aim of the current study was to test the hypotheses\nthat a) polymorphisms spanning PLAUR contribute to\nCOPD susceptibility and severity in smokers and b) that\nthese polymorphisms influence baseline lung function\n(FEV1 and FEV1\/FVC) in smokers. We have genotyped 27\nSNPs spanning PLAUR in a cohort recruited for COPD or\nsmoking history (n = 992 subjects) and completed a series\nof association analyses. We provide tentative evidence\nthat polymorphisms spanning PLAUR influence baseline\nlung function but do not support the conclusion that\nPLAUR is a major COPD susceptibility gene in smokers.\nMethods\nSubjects and Clinical Assessment\nThe subjects were recruited from five UK centres for smok-\ning history and\/or COPD diagnosis (Table 1). 537 sub-\njects were collected in Nottingham, Caucasian > 40 years\nand smoking >10 pack years or other centres (n = 455)\nrecruited for spirometry defined COPD confirmed by a\nphysician, Caucasian > 45 years old and smoking >10\npack years. The combined population (n = 992) recruited\nfor smoking history or COPD diagnosis were stratified\ninto healthy smokers (n = 176, post bronchodilator (BD,\nsalbutamol) FEV1 > 80% and postBD FEV1\/FVC > 0.7) and\nCOPD subjects (n = 599, post BD FEV1 < 80% and postBD\nFEV1\/FVC < 0.7).

COPD severity was investigated using post bron-\nchodilator spirometry, i.e. GOLD classification [12] (n =\n643, Additional file 1). Ethical approval was obtained\nfrom local ethics committees (Nottingham, Sheffield,\nManchester, Leicester, Oxford). Informed Consent from\nall subjects was obtained.\nSNP selection and Genotyping\nThe Human PLAUR gene has been sequenced in 46 Cau-\ncasian individuals (SeattleSNPs, http:\/\/pga.mbt.washing\nton.edu\/). SNPs were chosen for inferred function or their\nability to tag Linkage Disequlibrium (LD) blocks ([3],\nTable 2). CEPH genotyping data from the HapMap project\n(B34) in conjunction with Haploview software (v3.3) was\nused to identify tagging SNPs within the gene (R2 0.8,\nMinor Allele Frequency (MAF) 0.1) or 5'distal region (R2\n0.75, MAF 0.2) [13]. SNPs were genotyped by Kbio-\nsciences (Hitchin, UK) using genomic DNA. Hardy-Wein-\nberg Equilibrium was assessed using Haploview software\n[13].\nStatistical Analyses\nUsing SPSS (version 15, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) logistic\nregression analyses were completed for dichotomous\ntraits using additive (e.g. AA vs. AC vs. CC), recessive (AA\/\nAC vs. CC) or dominant (AA vs. AC\/CC) models. The\nCOPD susceptibility analyses included, age, sex and pack\nyears as covariates (Table 1) and the GOLD 1 versus 4\nanalyses included age as a covariate. Unadjusted contin-\ngency table analyses were completed using genotype or\nallele models (GraphPad Prism version 5, San Diego, CA).\nLinear regression determined the contribution of each\nSNP to baseline FEV1 (litres) or FEV1\/FVC ratio using addi-\ntive, recessive or dominant models including; age, sex,\nheight and smoking pack years as covariates. Haploview\nsoftware was used to identify PLAUR haplotypes. A p <\n0.01 was considered significant for all analyses.\n5'region analyses\nBasal promoter activity of PLAUR has been mapped to\n220 bp upstream of the start codon [14]. Using DNA from\n31 Caucasian subjects a 4 kb promoter region was ampli-\nfied and sequenced (Applied Biosystems, UK). SNPs were\nanalysed for transcription factor (TF) binding site changes\nusing online databases as described [15].\nTable 2: Gene location and minor allele frequencies of PLAUR SNPs genotyped\nNo. SNP Location in PLAUR Alleles Selected for: Smokers Controls COPD\n1 rs4803648 3'UTR A\/T LDtSNP 0.20 0.19 0.19\n2 rs4802189 3'UTR A\/C LDtSNP 0.16 0.16 0.15\n3 rs4251953 3'UTR\/intron G\/A LDtSNP 0.04 0.05 0.04\n4 rs4251938 3'UTR\/intron A\/G LDtSNP 0.12 0.12 0.11\n5 rs4251923 3'UTR\/intron G\/A 3'UTR 0.04 0.02 0.04\n6 rs4760 Exon 7 T\/C Pro317\/272Leu, LDtSNP 0.16 0.17 0.15\n7 rs2302524 Exon 6 T\/C Lys220\/175Arg LDtSNP 0.16 0.16 0.15\n8 rs4251864 Intron 3 T\/C LDtSNP 0.09 0.09 0.08\n9 rs2239372 Intron 3 G\/A LDtSNP 0.50 0.48 0.51\n10 rs2283628 Intron 3 T\/C LDtSNP 0.18 0.18 0.18\n11 rs4251846 Intron 3 C\/T LDtSNP 0.12 0.11 0.13\n12 rs2239374 Intron 3 C\/T LDtSNP 0.18 0.19 0.17\n13 rs2286960 Intron 1 C\/T LDtSNP 0.24 0.28 0.23\n14 rs4251805 5'UTR-119 G\/A Promoter 0.04 0.03 0.04\n15 rs344781 5'UTR-466 T\/C Promoter 0.23 0.29 0.29\n16 rs2356338 5'UTR-649 G\/T Promoter 0.28 0.29 0.29\n17 rs344780 5'UTR-3545 C\/T Promoter 0.23 0.20 0.22\n18 rs344779 5'UTR-3666 G\/T LDtSNP 0.39 0.40 0.37\n19 rs8113334 5'UTR-6873 T\/C LDtSNP 0.19 0.19 0.19\n20 rs4493171 5'UTR-10534 C\/T LDtSNP 0.22 0.19 0.23\n21 rs7259340 5'UTR-12331 C\/A LDtSNP 0.36 0.37 0.34\n22 rs11668247 5'UTR-20040 C\/T LDtSNP 0.39 0.43 0.37\n23 rs346043 5'UTR-20459 T\/C LDtSNP 0.26 0.26 0.27\n24 rs740587 5'UTR-22346 T\/C LDtSNP 0.45 0.49 0.42\n25 rs346054 5'UTR-30147 C\/G LDtSNP 0.45 0.47 0.46\nNumber 992 176 599\nLDtSNP = LD tagging SNPPage 3 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Genetics 2009, 10:112 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/10\/112Results\nClinical Characteristics and Allele Frequencies\nBaseline features of the COPD cases (n = 599) and con-\ntrols (n = 176) are shown in Table 1. As anticipated base-\nline FEV1 and FEV1\/FVC of the smoking controls and\nCOPD cases are significantly different (p < 0.0001). Com-\nparison of other baseline features between controls and\ncases identified significant differences for age, sex and\npack years, therefore in subsequent analyses we adjusted\nfor these variables. Also shown are the baseline features of\nmale and female smokers which show that females have\nsignificantly less smoking exposure and increased lung\nfunction compared to male subjects (p < 0.001). SNPs\nspanning PLAUR were genotyped (Table 2). Two of the 27\nSNPs, rs1994417 and rs4251831 showed deviation from\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.028 and p = 0.004\nrespectively) in the entire population (n = 992). These\nSNPs were removed from subsequent analyses.\nHaplotype structure\nThe haplotype structure of the PLAUR region generated\nusing all data is shown in Figure 1.

Several other SNPs showed borderline signifi-\ncance including SNPs in intron 1 (rs2286960, protec-\ntive(P)) and in the 5'region i.e. rs344779(-3666, P),\nrs11668247(-20040, P) and rs346054(-30147, P). These\ndata provide limited evidence that PLAUR SNPs are asso-\nciated with COPD susceptibility per se.\nPLAUR SNPs do not show association with spirometry \ndefined COPD severity\nSubjects were stratified according to GOLD criteria (Addi-\ntional file 1) and unadjusted analyses comparing GOLD\ngroups 1, 2, 3 and 4 and extreme severity (GOLD 1 versus\n4, adjusted for age) were completed. GOLD Stage 1-4\nanalyses did not identify any SNPs showing significant\nassociation.

PLAUR SNPs predicted\ndecline in FEV1 in asthma subjects and were associated\nwith PLAUR levels in plasma [3] (see Table 4). These data\nand the emerging role of PLAUR in tissue remodelling\nsuggested PLAUR may also influence COPD susceptibility\nin smokers. To test this hypothesis we genotyped 27 SNPs\nspanning PLAUR in a cohort of 992 smokers recruited for\nsmoking history and\/or COPD diagnosis, 25 SNPs passed\nquality control. Data from all subjects identified multiple\n5'region LD blocks, a region of low LD spanning the gene\nand a 3'region LD block in keeping with our previous data\n[3].\nIn our first analyses we determined if PLAUR SNPs are risk\nfactors for the development of spirometry defined COPD.\nThese data identified only one SNP association (p < 0.01)\ni.e. rs740587 in the 5'region was protective however mul-\ntiple borderline associations were observed particularly\nfor additional SNPs in the promoter\/5'region. We have\npreviously shown that asthma risk alleles span the entire\nPLAUR gene including the 5'region, intron 3 and 3'region\n(Table 4, [3]). There was no direct concordance between\nasthma and COPD risk alleles and our data does not sup-\nport the conclusion that PLAUR SNPs are major risk fac-\ntors for the development of COPD in smokers.\nThe finding that the only signal for COPD susceptibility\nmaps to the 5'region is of interest due to the observation\nthat soluble PLAUR is elevated seven fold in the sputum\nof COPD patients [16] suggesting mechanisms underlying\ndisease association may at least in part involve altered\nPLAUR transcription. In agreement with this hypothesis a\nrecent study identified PLAUR mRNA expression in lung\ntissue as a marker of COPD and showed a significant cor-\nrelation between FEF25-75(%Pred) and PLAUR mRNA\nexpression (r = -0.44) [17].\nTable 4: Concordance between asthma analyses and the current study\nSNP Allele *Asthma \nSusceptibility\nDecline in \nFEV1 in \nasthma\n*Serum \nPLAUR\nCOPD \nSusceptibility\nCOPD \nSeverity\n(GOLD 1\/4)\nBaseline \nFEV1\nBaseline \nFEV1\/FVC\nrs4803648 T Risk Accelerated - - - - -\nrs4802189 C Risk Accelerated - - - - -\nrs4251953 A - Accelerated - - - - -\nrs4251938 G Risk - - - - - -\nrs4251923 A - - - - - - -\nrs4760 C - Slowed - - - - -\nrs2302524 C Risk Accelerated - - - Decreased -\nrs4251864 C - - - - - - -\nrs2239372 A Risk - Increased - - - -\nrs2283628 C - - - - - Increased -\nrs4251846 T - - - - - - -\nrs2239374 T - - - - - - -\nrs2286960 T - Slowed - - - - -\nrs4251805 A - - - - - - -\nrs344781 C - NA - - - - -\nrs2356338 T Risk Accelerated Increased - - - -\nrs344780 T - - - - - - -\nrs344779 T - - - - - - Increased\nrs8113334 C -- - - - - - -\nrs4493171 T Protection - Decreased - - - -\nrs7259340 A - - - - - - -\nrs11668247 T - - - - Protection - Increased\nrs346043 C Risk Accelerated Increased - - - -\nrs740587 C - - - Protection - - Increased\nrs346054 G - - - - - - -\n*Significant Family Based Association Test (FBAT) results from our previous study.[3] using three asthma family cohorts from Nottingham, \nSouthampton and The Netherlands (n = 587 families).

Additional\nanalysis of extremes of severity (GOLD 1 versus 4) again\nhighlighted a role for rs11668247 in the 5'region in keep-\ning with the COPD susceptibility analyses suggesting a\nmodest influence of the distal 5'region SNPs.\nIn order to extend our case\/control analyses we investi-\ngated the role of PLAUR SNPs in determining baseline\nlung function in this cohort. These analyses identified sev-\neral significant associations; rs2302524(Lys220Arg) and\nrs2283628 (intron 3) were associated with lower and\nhigher FEV1 respectively. rs740587(5'UTR-22346),\nrs11668247(5'UTR-20040) and rs344779(5'UTR-3666)\nin the 5'region were all associated with increased FEV1\/\nFVC ratio. Interestingly, several SNPs showed very clear\nallele dose effects on FEV1\/FVC ratio e.g. rs740587(5'UTR-\n22346), providing greater confidence in these data. The\nmagnitude of effect was ~5% change in FEV1\/FVC\nbetween genotypes and so potentially these effects are\nclinically relevant and surprising for a single SNP in a sin-\ngle gene. Interestingly, two of the SNPs associated with\nbaseline FEV1\/FVC were also associated with COPD sus-\nceptibility and severity respectively, i.e. rs740587(5'UTR-\n22346) and rs11668247(5'UTR-20040) in the 5'region.\nThe rs2302524 (Lys220Arg) association with reduced\nbaseline FEV1 values is of interest as this variant may be\npredicted to change the coding sequence of the PLAUR\nprotein and this polymorphism has previously been asso-\nciated with increased asthma risk and increased decline in\nFEV1 in asthma ([3], Table 4) The Lys220Arg is considered\na conservative substitution, however the functional signif-\nicance of this finding remains to be resolved. Interestingly,\nour data suggests a potential need for both alleles to be\npresent prior to a physiological effect, i.e. a recessive effect.\nIt is also important to note that the single SNP associa-\ntions reflect the linkage disequilibrium spanning the\nPLAUR gene e.g. rs11668247 and rs740587 are both asso-\nciated with increased baseline FEV1\/FVC and these SNPs\nare in high LD i.e. are inherited together more than by\nchance suggesting they both tag or contribute to the cau-\nsation mechanism.\nFor the key associations with lung function we were also\ninterested to determine if males or females were driving\nthe associations and therefore completed gender specific\nanalyses. All baseline features including mean age, smok-\ning pack years and lung function (pre and post bronchodi-\nlator FEV1 and FEV1\/FVC) were significantly different\nbetween the male and female smokers. These data are in\nkeeping with a recent study that examined gender specific\ndifferences between subjects with severe emphysema and\nagain identified less severe airway obstruction in females\n[18]. Our data suggest that the rs740587(5'UTR-22346)\nand rs344779(5'UTR-3666) associations with FEV1\/FVC\nare driven by the male subjects as females do not exhibit\nthe allele dose effect on FEV1\/FVC ratio. Interesting, by\nselecting male subjects only the magnitude of effect was\nalso increased i.e. the range of FEV1\/FVC between geno-\ntypes for rs344779 for all subjects was 5.1% but for males\nwas 7.3%, females 2.7%. This would suggest females do\nnot demonstrate the lower FEV1\/FVC ratio in carriers of\nthe common alleles at these loci. These data are intriguing\nand potentially suggest that the effects of the polymor-\nphisms in the 5'region are unmasked only in males i.e.\ngender specific transcriptional mechanisms. However, it is\nalso feasible that the SNP effects are only identifiable in\nmore severe airway obstruction i.e. in the males. This\nobservation requires further investigation.\nCardiovascular disease including; ischemic heart diseases,\nhypertension and myocardial infarction have also been\nshown to be a common co-morbidity in COPD [11] and\nCOPD may be an independent risk factor for the develop-\nment of cardiovascular disease [19]. PLAUR levels have\nbeen associated with vascular remodelling [20] and\nmonocyte adhesion in acute myocardial infarction [21].\nTherefore it is feasible that in the COPD case control anal-\nyses we are really testing association with cardiovascular\ndisease not COPD. While we have not formally tested the\nassociation between PLAUR SNPs and cardiovascular dis-\nease outcomes as we do not have this information, this\nseems unlikely. Our data suggests PLAUR SNPs influence\nbaseline lung function in smokers irrespective of the pres-\nence or absence of COPD. Similarly, we have identified\nthat PLAUR SNPs are determinants of baseline lung func-\ntion in asthmatic children where clearly cardiovascular\ndisease is not anticipated to confound the analyses [3].\nIn order to begin to investigate mechanisms underlying\nassociations we have sequenced 4000 bp of the core pro-\nmoter and identified a further five novel and two reported\npolymorphisms making a total of 12 polymorphisms in\nhigh LD (Additional file 3). Several of these SNPs generate\nets family binding sites. c-ets-1 is of particular interest as\nthis transcription factor is induced by oxidative stress e.g.\nH2O2 [22]. Importantly, H2O2 in breath condensate is ele-\nvated in COPD [23] and asthma [24]. These data poten-\ntially provide the link between the airway environment\nand expression of PLAUR determined by the presence\/\nabsence of SNPs. Interestingly, PLAU and PAI-1 expres-\nsion are also elevated in sputum from asthma and COPD\nsubjects [16] suggesting the plasminogen system may be\naugmented in these diseases. Importantly, PLAU and PAI1\ntranscription is also up regulated by ets-1 [25,26]. Also of\ninterest is the alteration in Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)\nbinding sites due to the presence of a polymorphism (e.g.\nSNP rs11668247(5'UTR-20040) that was associated with\nCOPD severity and lung function generates a HIF1 site.Page 8 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Genetics 2009, 10:112 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/10\/112PLAUR transcription has been shown to be increased by\nHIF1\u03b2 under hypoxia conditions [27] which may be a\nmechanism involved in epithelial mesenchymal transi-\ntion (EMT) [28].\nThe exact mechanism by which PLAUR contributes to the\nunderlying pathobiology of the airways remains to be\nresolved, however its role in the generation of plasmin\nwhich subsequently leads to ECM degradation, MMP acti-\nvation, TGF\u03b21 activation, 5-lipoxygenase activation and\ncell migration implicate tissue remodelling as a key func-\ntion [29,30]. The complex role of the PLAU-PLAUR path-\nway in the airways is illustrated in Figure 3. It is important\nto note that there is accumulating evidence that genetic\npolymorphism in genes encoding components of the\nPLAU-PLAUR regulatory network constitute risk factors\nfor the development of COPD e.g. polymorphisms span-\nning Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E (SERPINE2) have\nshown significant association with COPD susceptibility,\nFEV1 and FEV1\/FVC [31]. The SERPINE2 gene encodes a\nPLAU inhibitor providing further support for the role of\nthe PLAU-PLAUR pathway in COPD pathogenesis.\nThe complex role of the PLAU-PLAUR pathway in the airwaysFigure 3\nThe complex role of the PLAU-PLAUR pathway in the airways. PLAUR is a complex, multi-domain (D1, 2, 3) mole-\ncule and exists as a membrane bound GPI linked protein and in multiple soluble forms. The interaction between PLAU-PLAUR \nis critical for the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and is regulated by a series of proteins including; PAI-1, PAI-2 and \nSERPINE2 which have previously been implicated in COPD pathogenesis [16,31]. Plasmin has many downstream proteolytic \neffects including those common to remodelling of the airways e.g. MMP activation. In addition PLAUR interacts with several \nmembrane receptors leading to the activation of signalling cascades resulting in alterations in; proliferation, migration, adhesion, \nendocytosis and cytoskeletal changes. PLAUR also exists in multiple soluble forms (sPLAUR) generated by splicing and\/or pro-\nteolytic cleavage implicated in chemotaxis and interactions with the extracellular matrix [5,35,36].Page 9 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Genetics 2009, 10:112 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2350\/10\/112Chromosome 19q13 has previously been investigated for\ngenetic determinants influencing COPD susceptibility. In\nparticular one of five tested SNPs spanning Transforming\nGrowth Factor \u03b21 TGFB1 (at 41.8 Mbp) was associated\nwith severe COPD in case (n = 304) control (n = 441)\nanalyses and airway obstruction in family (77 pedigrees)\nanalyses (p < 0.05) [10]. Similarly, one of four tested SNPs\nwithin latent transforming growth factor beta binding\nprotein 4, LTB4P (at 41.8 Mbp) was associated (p = 0.01)\nwith a densiometric emphysema distribution phenotype\n(Basal 1\/3 lower lobe) [32] but not lung function [33] in\n282 and 304 subjects respectively from the National\nEmphysema Trial. Overall, therefore the evidence that\nTGFB1 and LTB4P underlie the linkage with FEV1 and\nFEV1\/FVC observed to the region is underwhelming.\nImportantly, in our asthma analyses we excluded these\nregions as containing the main dominants of lung func-\ntion using a combination of linkage and association anal-\nyses [3]. However, it is also important to note that in\nCOPD the linkage peak may involve genetic determinants\nin multiple genes underlying the signal.\nThis study extends our asthma association and has several\nstrengths including extensive evaluation of polymorphic\nvariation spanning the PLAUR region to examine COPD\nsusceptibility and the examination of dichotomous and\ncontinual lung function traits. However, the limitations of\nthis study include the absence of an independent replica-\ntion sample, and that some of the dichotomous analyses\nwere based on small numbers. The low number of con-\ntrols versus cases in the dichotomous COPD analysis may\nat least in part explain the lack of concordance in findings\ngenerated using the continual lung function traits which\nprovided more clear evidence for association. It is also\nimportant to note that the current study examines the role\nof PLAUR SNPs in the development of airway obstruction\nin smokers and does not test the role of PLAUR polymor-\nphisms in non smoking individuals.\nConclusion\nWe provide preliminary evidence that PLAUR SNPs influ-\nence baseline lung function in smokers.
