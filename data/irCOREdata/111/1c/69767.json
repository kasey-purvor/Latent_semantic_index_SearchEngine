By \nC .  S. PRIMROSE, J. B. LEIPER and R. J. MAUGHAN, Department of Environmental \nand Occupational Medicine, University Medical School, Foresterhill, Aberdeen \nA B 9  2 2 0  \nGastric emptying of glucose drinks is controlled such that the higher the energy density \nthe slower the emptying rate but the greater the energy delivery to the intestine. Few \nstudies have examined how quickly water from ingested drinks is supplied to the gut and \nabsorbed. We have compared the rate of gastric emptying and absorption of water from \ntwo glucose-electrolyte solutions (GES) in resting man. Eight fasted male volunteers \nconsumed on two occasions, in randomized order, 500 ml of either a 5% (LG) or 20% \n(HG) glucose solution containing the same concentrations of electrolytes and 12 g of \ndeuterium oxide. Gastric emptying was measured over 60 min using a double-sampling \naspiration technique (Beckers et al. 1988), and unidirectional uptake of water was \nestimated by measuring the rate of accumulation in arterialized-venous blood of a tracer \nfor water (deuterium) (Maughan et al. 1990). Mean (SD) gastric emptying rate expressed \nas slope values (mVmin) of LG (8.5 (1.6)) was faster (P<O.OOl) than HG (4.9 (1.0)). The \namount of glucose emptied from both solutions was similar for the initial 30 min after \ningestion; thereafter glucose delivery was greater from HG. By the end of the study 60.9 \n(SD 11-3) g of glucose was emptied from HG and 24.3 (SD 0.9) g from LG (P<0.004). \nTime to peak deuterium concentration (T,,,, min) in the circulation was faster from LG \n(30 (SD 13)) compared with HG (51 (SD 11); P<0-004). Deuterium accumulation rate \n(ppdmin) expressed as slope values to T,, was faster from LG (13 (SD 5 ) )  than from \nHG (4 (SD 1); P<O-OOl) .  These data do not allow us to conclude whether the faster rate \nof deuterium accumulation from LG was due to the difference in gastric emptying rate or \nthe known improved intestinal water absorption rate of dilute GES compared with \nhypertonic GES with a high glucose content (Leiper & Maughan, 1986). \nBeckers, E.

By J .  C. MATHERS, PATRICIA .  LAWLOR and D. S.  PARKER, Department \nof Agricultural Biochemistry and Nutrition, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, \nNewcastle upon Tyne NEl  7RU \nGuar gum (GG) consumption flattens the post-prandial glycaemic response by mechan- \nisms which are not fully understood. When fed in semi-purified diets, GG increases the \nviscosity of small intestinal (SI) contents, reduces convective movement adjacent to the \nmucosa and may alter mucosal enzyme activities (Johnson, 1990). It is not known if GG \nhas these effects when present in normal mixed human foods. \nTwenty-four male Wistar rats (initial weight 96 g) were given ad lib. access to diets of \nwhich breakfast cereals provided 0.454.49 present as corn flakes (CF), CF + GG (9%) \nwheat flakes (WF) or WF + GG (12%). Dried skimmed milk powder was added to attain \nprotein contents of 150 g\/kg. After 27 d, activities of brush border hydrolases (U\/mg \nmucosa) were measured in mucosa from the proximal and distal regions of the SI; 25 and \n75% of distance from the pylorus respectively. \nCorn flakes Wheat flakes Statistical significance \nSE Of \n-GG +GG -GG +GG mean Flakes GG Interaction \nProximal small intestine \nNS NS \nNS \nNS \nMaltase 16.3 16.5 22.6 21.6 2.15 ** \nSucrase 1-82 1.41 2.32 1.86 0.172 ** ** \nTripeptidase 64.8 19.9 56.4 13.5 6.90 NS \nNS NS Maltase 27.0 26.6 19.2 18.1 2.04 *** \nNS Sucrase 1.77 2.24 1.26 1.59 0.153 *** ** \nTripeptidase 63.6 66.1 63.8 37.8 8.83 NS NS NS \nSI length (cm) 113 118 109 120 3.2 NS NS \n** \nDistal small intestine \n* \nNS, not significant. \n*P<0.10, **P<0.05, ***P<O.Ol \nDisaccharidase activities were higher in the proximal SI of WF- than of CF-fed rats \nwhilst the reverse was observed for the ileum.

By \nDEVINA MCCLEAN~ and K. J. MCCRACKEN~.~, The Queen\u2019s University of Belfast, \nNewforge Lane, Belfast BT9 5PX and 2Food and Agricultural Chemistry Depart- \nment, Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland \nThere is evidence (Elwinger & Saterby, 1987), that enzyme supplements improve the \nfeeding value of diets for broiler chickens, and Inborr & Graham (1991), observed \nimprovements in faecal digestibility of wheat-barley-based diets for weaned pigs. \nThis experiment was done to assess the relative contributions of the small and large \nintestine to digestion of diets based on wheat feed, and the effect of enzyme supplemen- \ntation on apparent digestibility at either site. \nThe experiment was done in two replicates using six four-week-old littermate pigs per \nreplicate. Pigs, fitted with a T-piece cannula at the ileo-caecal junction, were allocated to \none of six experimental diets. Diets contained wheat feed at 200 or 400 g\/kg and were \nsupplemented with cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4) alone (0.2 g\/kg) or plus pectinase (EC \n3.2.1.15, 0.1 g\/kg) and xylanase (EC 3.2.1.32, 0-2 g\/kg). Faecal collections (7 d) were \nmade in conjuction with 8 h ileal collections on alternate days throughout the balance \nperiod. \nDigestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and gross energy (GE) at faecal \nand ileal sites were significantly higher (P<O.OOl and P<0.05 respectively) for the 200 \ng\/kg diet (see Table). No significant effects of enzyme supplements were observed on \ndigestibility at either site. \nApparent ileal and faecal digestibilities (n 12) \nDry matter Crude protein Gross energy \nDiet \n(wheat feed dkg) Faecal Ileal Faecal Ileal Faecal Ileal \n200 0.87 0.75 047 0.77 0.87 0.77 \n400 0.81 0.66 0.81 0.69 0.81 0.67 \nSEM 0.012 0.021 0,016 0.032 0.014 0.024 \nP< 0.001 0.05 0,001 0.05 0.001 0.05 \nThe difference between faecal and ileal digestibility values was greater (P<0.05) for \nthe 400 g\/kg wheat feed diet. However, the degree of fermentation of the residue from \nthe terminal ileum was unchanged by level of wheat feed inclusion, averaging 43.6%. \nIt is concluded that there is considerable capacity for hind gut fermentation in the \nweaned pig and that the digestibility of wheat feed is not improved by enzyme \nsupplementation. \nThe financial support of J.

A.  \nEDWARDS and M. A.  EASTWOOD, Gastrointestinal Laboratory, Western General \nHospital, Edinburgh EH4 2XU \nIspaghula and bran are both effective in bulking the stool and relieving the symptoms of \ndiverticulosis. However, bran reduces intraluminal colonic pressure and ispaghula \nincreases it (Eastwood et al. 1978). Ia the present study the effect of ispaghula and bran \non the caecal, proximal and distal colonic contents was investigated to identify \ndifferences in the physical or chemical properties that may account for the different \neffects on pressure. \nForty male Wistar rats (150 g) were transferred onto a low-fibre diet (45 g non-starch \npolysaccharide (NSP)\/kg) from a stock diet (CRMX, 133 g NSP\/kg) for 4 weeks. Their \ndiet was then supplemented with either 100 g coarse wheat bran\/kg (Chancellot Mills \nLtd, Edinburgh, 95% passed through 0.5-1.5 mm sieves, 463 g NSP\/kg; ten rats) or 50 g \nispaghula\/kg (Plantago ovata Husk, Richardson Vicks Ltd UK, 996 g NSP\/kg; ten rats) \nto provide equal amounts of dietary fibre. Twenty rats remained on the low-fibre diet. \nAfter a further 4 weeks the rats were killed and the contents of the caecum, proximal and \ndistal colon (first half and second half) collected for wet and dry weight measurements, \nand short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis. Results were compared by one-way analysis \nof variance and Student\u2019s t test. \nBoth ispaghula and bran increased faecal wet and dry weights but ispaghula was the \nmore effective (wet weight (g\/d): basal 3.15, ispaghula 7.9, bran 5.4 (SE 0.43); dry weight \n(g\/d): basal 1.51, ispaghula 2.8, bran 2.10 (sE 0.13)). Ispaghula increased the basal wet \ncontent throughout the colon by over 100% (caecum: basal wet weight 3.78 g, ispaghula \n7-53 g (SE 0.44); proximal colon: basal wet weight 0.5 g, ispaghula 1.92 g (SE 0.16); distal \ncolon: basal wet weight 1.33 g, ispaghula 2.55 g (SE 0.2); P<O.OOl)  but significantly \nincreased the dry content only in the caecum, resulting in greater and more liquid colonic \ncontents. Bran had no significant effect on wet or dry weight of colonic contents \ncompared with the basal diet animals. Although ispaghula-fed rats had the highest SCFA \ncontent (Fmol) throughout the colon (caecum: basal 334, ispaghula 532, bran 272 (SE \n31.1); proximal colon: basal 47.9, ispaghula 103.6, bran 52-5 (sE 9.8); distal colon: basal \n88.0, ispaghula 137, bran 76-1 (SE 11.9); P < O . O l  ispaghula compared with basal), \nbecause of increased water the concentration was similar to the bran-fed and basal rats. \nThere was no significant difference between the amount of colonic SCFA of the bran-fed \nand basal rats but faecal output of SCFA was increased in the bran-fed rats. \nThe SCFA profile of the bran-fed and ispaghula-fed rats was different, with a higher \nproportion of propionic acid (mol\/mol) in the caecum of the ispaghula-fed animals (basal \n178, ispaghula 216, bran 150 (SE 7.6); P<O.O1 ispaghula compared with basal), and a \nhigher proportion of butyric acid (moVmol) in the bran-fed animals (basal 141, ispaghula \n129, bran 232 (SE 12-8); P<O.OOl bran compared with basal). Whereas the SCFA profile \nwas maintained throughout the colon for ispaghula, the characteristic profile for bran \nfermentation was present only in the caecum. In the colon there was no significant \ndifference between the bran- and basal diet-fed rats. \nThese results have indicated large differences in the luminal colonic contents of bran- \nand ispaghula-fed rats. The biggest differences were seen in the proximal colon. The \nincreased liquid content of the ispaghula-fed rats may increase distension and therefore \nalter motility. The SCFA results suggest that most of the fermentation of bran occurs in \nthe cirecum whereas ispaghula may continue to be fermented throughout the colon, \nmaintaining its effects on the luminal SCFA. \nEastwood, M.

By C. A. EDWARDS, M. BRUCE and A. \nFERGUSON, Gastrointestinal Laboratories, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh \nEH4 2XU \nProlonged use of elemental diets causes colonic mucosal hypoplasia thought to be related \nto a decrease in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. In this study, the effect of \nsupplementing an elemental diet (E028, Scientific Hospital Supplies Ltd., Liverpool) \nwith dextran 35 (a fermentable polysaccharide composed of glycopyranose units linked \nat C1 and C2 with 4% branching, mol wt 35 000; Fisons plc., Loughborough) on \ncolonic SCFA and mucosal cellular proliferation was investigated. Sixty female Wistar \nrats, weaned on to a laboratory diet (CRMX, 133 g non-starch polysaccharide\/kg) for 4 \nweeks, were divided into three groups fed either CRMX, elemental (ED) or ED plus \ndextran (50 g\/kg). After 4 weeks, ten rats in each group were injected with colchicine. At \n20,40,60,80 or 110 min after colchicine the rats were killed, a sample of tissue was taken \nfrom the proximal and distal colon and processed for microdissection and measurement \nof number of metaphase per crypt and crypt length. The other rats were killed and \nsamples were taken of caecal, proximal and colonic contents for wet and dry weight and \nSCFA content. Caecal SCFA results were used because of the lack of proximal sample \navailable. \nAs expected rats fed ED had little colonic content, and lower SCFA than the rats fed \nCRMX. At both sites studied, for ED-fed rats the mean crypt length and crypt cell \nproduction rate (CCPR) were lower than CRMX-fed rats, although only significantly so \nin the proximal colon. Addition of dextran 35 increased colonic contents and the amount \nof SCFA in the caecum and distal colon (but not concentration), and produced similar \nvalues for CCPR and crypt length to the CRMX-fed rats, but crypt length in the proximal \ncolon remained significantly shorter. \nIn conclusion, the elemental diet caused significant hypoplasia of the proximal but not \nthe distal colon despite large changes in SCFA content. Dextran increased colonic \ncontents and SCFA, but although there was a tendency for CCPR and crypt length to \nincrease, they did not return to the CRMX values in all rats. \nTotal SCFA Total SCFA Tissue wt Crypt Metaphasesl \n(mmoV1) (pmoUsection) (8) length (km) crypt per h \nMean SE Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE \nProximal colont \nCRMX 86 3 287 28 0.43 0.03 147 26 5.09 0.82 \nElemental 66** 4 63*** 9 0.30** 0.03 119* 19 4.02* 0.60 \nElem+dextran 73 5 112***$ 11 0.32' 0.03 121* 14 5.67 1.36 \nDistal colon \nCRMX 69 3 88 9 0.40 0.02 194 17 4.18 1.46 \nElemental 45*** 6 13*** 1 0.35 0.02 122 27 3.09 0.24 \nElem+dextran 60 6 34**$ 4 0.32** 0.02 1Y9 20 4.32 1.54 \nSignificantly different from laboratory diet (CRMX): 'kP<0.05, **P<O.O1, ***P<O.OOl. \nCrypt cell production rate was compared by analysis of variance of slope: all other variables were compared \nt Caecal SCFA was measured instead of proximal colon. \n$ Dextran significantly different to elemental. \nby one-way analysis of variance and t test. \nThis work was supported by Scientific Hospital Supplies Ltd., Liverpool. \n6A A B S T R A C T S  0 F C O M  MUN I C  AT1 ONS 1992 \nIn vitro fermentation of a galacto-oligosaccharide by human bacteria in continuous \nculture.

GRIVET, Dkpartement de Physique, Universite' d'Orkans, \n45071 Orlkans Ckdex, France \nA transgalactosylated oligosaccharide (TOS), (Ga1)n-Glc ( n  14), produced in Japan \n(Yakult Institute) is assumed to escape digestion in the small intestine and be available \nfor fermentation in the large bowel. This study was designed to determine the effects of \nTOS on fermentation metabolism and balance after adaptation of the flora. \nThe four 1 litre vessels of a continuous culture system (see Denis et al. 1990) were \ninoculated with a mixture of homogenized and diluted (110 g\/l) human faeces collected \nfrom three methane (CH4)-producing adult volunteers (faeces kindly provided by L. \nAbensour, HBpital St Lazare, Paris). The vessels were continuously infused with a \ncomplex medium. After 7 d of adaptation, two vessels (+TOS) were fed daily 10 g of \nTOS delivered twice, whereas the other two (controls) were run with the complex \nmedium only; the experiment was then continued for 15 d. At the end of the experiment \nthe flora from each control and +TOS vessels were collected and assayed for reductive \nacetogenesis activity measured by 13C NMR (see De Graeve et al. 1991). \nMaximum degradability of TOS (95%) was obtained after 3 d of feeding and thereafter \nthe fermentation became stabilized. The daily production of short-chain fatty acids \n(SCFA) and gas* (mmol) measured after 5-6 d ( n  4) are shown in the Table. \nVessels \nTotal \nSCFA Acetate Propionate Butyrate CO?

This is in \nkeeping with the results of reductive acetogenesis activity according to which TOS had an \nenhancing effect on the incorporation of 'jC02 into acetate and butyrate carbons (8.3 \nand 3.1 mM I3C incorporated for TOS and control, respectively). These observations \nsuggest that oligosaccharides may activate the reduction of CO2 to acetate and butyrate \nby human flora even in the presence of methanogenesis. Calculation of the fermentation \nbalance of TOS carbon (+TOS minus control data) showed that 55% was recovered in \nSCFA whereas 15% was recovered in the biomass. The recovery in SCFA indicates the \namount of energy which could be saved for the host when feeding this oligosaccharide. \nDe Graeve. K. G. ,  Grivet, J. P. ,  Durand, M..

To determine the fermentative pattern, adult germ-free rats were \ninoculated with a human flora belonging to a methanogenic donor (see Andrieux et nl. \n1991 for details). Rats (four per group) were fed a \u2018human-type diet\u2019 containing either \n10% of sucrose (control diet), or 5% or 10% of TOS (experimental diets). Total gas \nexcretion was measured in a respiratory chamber (Le Coz et ul. 1989).

By HEATHER J .  FINLAYSON, RANDI BARSTAD and J. C. \nMATHERS, Department of Agricultural Biochemistry and Nutrition, The University, \nNewcastle upon Tyne N E l  7RU \nWe have previously reported (Pedroso et al. 1989,1990~) that replacement of sucrose by \nfoods rich in complex carbohydrates (CC), reduced the activity of several lipogenic \nenzymes. Inclusion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), the major fermentation end- \nproducts of CC, in a sucrose-containing diet mimicked the effects of the CC (Pedroso \net al. 19906). \nThe current experiment investigated the individual and interactive effects of differing \ndietary CC and oil sources on the activities (nmol product\/min per mg protein) of three \nNADPH-generating enzymes: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49; \nG6PDH), NADP-malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.40; ME) and NADP-isocitrate \ndehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.42; IDH). The results reported refer only to the effects of the \nthree CC sources (100 g\/kg diet): glucose, i.e. no CC (NC), guar gum (GG) and soya \nfibre (SF), each of which was fed as part of a semi-synthetic diet containing no sucrose to \na total of twenty rats for 21-26 d. \nCaecal SCFA \nMolar proportions \n(nmol\/mol) \ncc Total \nsource (mM) Ac Pro Bu \nEnzyme activity \nLiver G6PDH \n(adipose \nIDH ME G6PDH tissue) \nNC 45.2\" 538a 284h 94b \nGG 7 1 4  527\" 312c 53\" \nSF 66.0' 633h 178\" 14Ic \nS E M  5.6 15 11 4 \n112b 6.7a 11.5b 11.5 \n162ah 24.4b 17.3\" 11.7 \n154\" 7.6\" 7.6a 13.1 \n3.2 049 0.45 0.83 \nAc, acetate: Pro, propionate; Bu, butyrate. \na,b Values in the same column with different superscripts are significantly different: P<0.01. \nAlthough inclusion of both GG and SF increased the total SCFA concentration \nrelative to NC, there were marked differences in the proportions of the individual SCFA. \nCompared with NC, GG resulted in greatly increased propionate and reduced butyrate \nwith the converse for SF. Activities of ME and G6PDH (which provide most of the \nNADPH for lipogenesis) were significantly increased by GG whilst G6PDH was reduced \nin SF-fed rats. There was no effect of CC source on activity of G6PDH in epididymal \nadipose tissue. The results suggest: (l), that the ratio of butyrate to propionate reaching \nthe liver may influence the hepatic NADPH-generating enzymes and ( 2 ) ,  that the effect \nis directly on the liver and not via a systemic mechanism, since adipose tissue G6PDH \nremained unchanged despite major changes in hepatic G6PDH activity. \nThe authors acknowledge the co-operation of Dr. R.

TIPTON, Department of Biochemistry, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Republic \nof Ireland \nChronic ethanol intake in rats and in man is reported to cause ultrastructural alterations \nof the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum of the small intestinal mucosal epi- \nthelium and the hepatocyte. Monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4, MAO), an integral \nenzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane, is present in both of these tissues, where \nit plays an important role in the first-pass metabolism of dietary amines. Two isoenzymes \nexist with differing substrate affinities and inhibitor sensitivities; 5-hydroxytryptamine \nand P-phenylethylamine being preferential substrates, clorgyline and 1-deprenyl being \nselective inhibitors of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively. Chronic ethanol intake is \nassociated with decreased M A 0  activity in the brain of rats and humans. This study was \ncarried out to determine the effect of ethanol consumption on intestinal and hepatic \nMAO. \nMale Wistar rats were fed a Lieber-deCarli diet for 5 weeks. The test group (C, n 16) \nreceived ethanol-containing (5% w\/v, 36% total calories) feed ad lib. and the pair-fed \ncontrol group (B, n 16) a diet with isocaloric substitution of dextrin-maltose for ethanol. \nAnother control group (A, n 16) took ethanol-free feed ad lib. MAO-A and MAO-B \nactivities were determined in duodenal mucosal cell homogenates and in liver mito- \nchondrial preparations, using a radiochemical technique.

By DAVID \nFARRELL, Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Nutrition, University of \nNew England, Armidale, N S W  2351, Australia \nThe beneficial effects of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) on the \nincidence of cardiovascular disease and some other diseases in humans (Galli & \nSimopoulos, 1989) is now well established; fish is a major dietary source of n-3 LCPUFA. \nWe offered diets with added (70 g\/kg) cod liver, rapeseed (Canola) or linseed oils to \nhens and successfully enriched the eggs with n-3 LCPUFA compared to eggs from hens \non a control diet (Fig. la). A sensory evaluation panel could not distinguish between the \nfour egg types. Forty-four free-living volunteers consumed eggs from hens on a \ncommercial feed for 2 weeks. The volunteers were then divided into equal groups and \ngiven two eggs daily from one of the four groups of birds for the following 7 weeks. \nPlasma samples were drawn and other measurements made on subjects fasted overnight \nand at intervals of 0 , 2 , 5 , 7  and 9 weeks. \nConsumption of two eggs daily for 9 weeks did not alter mean plasma cholesterol \nwhich ranged from 4.7 to 5.2 mmol\/l. High-density lipoproteins declined (P<0.05) from \n1.5 to 1.1 mmoVl over time. The increase in plasma n-3 LCPUFA of volunteers after 7 \nweeks on eggs from hens given the experimental diets is shown in Fig. lb .  The increase \nwas greatest in those consuming the eggs from hens on the cod liver oil and Canola oil \ndiets and particularly for docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) and total n-3 LCPUFA. It is \nconcluded that enrichment of eggs is a practical way of providing humans with a dietary \nsource of n-3 LCPUFA. \n18:3 20:5 22:6 \nI \nTotal 18:3 20:5 22:6 Total \nFig. 1.

KLINOWSKI, University Department of Chemistry, Cambridge \nThe occurrence of aluminosilicate deposits in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer\u2019s \ndementia (Candy et al. 1986) has stimulated interest in the possible role of such inorganic \nagents in the aetiopathogenesis of the disease (Evans et al. 1991). \nWe have examined the capacity of several model natural and synthetic aluminosilicate \nmaterials of differing particle size, shape and ionic composition, to stimulate the \ngeneration of free radical and related reactive oxidant species (ROS) by purified murine \nbrain glial macrophage-type cells in vitro. The ROS were monitored in real time by \nluminol-dependent chemiluminescence. Standard soluble and particulate positive con- \ntrol stimulants of the oxygen burst, namely the tumour promoter phorbol myristate \nacetate (PMA) and zymosan, were also examined, together with phosphate saline buffer \nalone. \nI I I 1 \n200 \n0 10 20 30 40 \nTime (Min) \n0 10 20 30 40 \nTime (Min) \nFig. \nerionite) 0 ,  PMA *, zymosan *, and phosphate-buffered saline 63. \nMurine glial chemiluminescent response to calcium ionic form of fibrous ahminosilicate (Turkish \nThe results show that the calcium ionic form of the fibrous aluminosilicate mineral \nerionite, exhibited a significant stimulatory reactivity. \nThe findings suggest that analogous deposits of fibrillary aluminosilicates in association \nwith reactive microglial cells found within the cerebral neuritic plaques in Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease, may similarly contribute to free radical oxidant-mediated neurodegenerative \ndamage.

By \nH. E. BRISTOW, J. J. STRAIN and R. W. WELCH, Human Nutrition Research \nGroup, University of Ulster at Jordanstown, Newtownabbey, Co. Antrim BT37 OQB \nPrevious work from this laboratory has indicated that feeding rats diets either low (20 \nmg\/kg) or high (400 mg\/kg) in iron had little effect on antioxidant enzyme activities or \nhepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, the high-Fe diet significantly \nincreased plasma cholesterol (Bristow et al. 1991). In the current experiment a range of \ndietary Fe levels was used to investigate further the effect of Fe status on antioxidant \nenzymes, MDA and plasma cholesterol. \nFour groups ( n  6) of male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were housed individually, \nand were fed ad lib. for 6 weeks on synthetic diets which contained Fe levels of 20 mg\/kg, \n35 mg\/kg, 150 mg\/kg and 400 mg\/kg. Haemoglobin (Hb), transferrin saturation (TS), \nand hepatic and kidney Fe were measured as indices of Fe status. A range of antioxidant \nand related enzyme activities, namely plasma caeruloplasmin (EC 1.16.3. l) ,  whole blood \nglutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9, GSH.Px), erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate de- \nhydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49, GGPDH), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6, CAT) and superoxide \ndismutase (EC 1.15.1.1, SOD), and hepatic SOD, G6PDH, GSH.Px, CAT, glutathione \nreductase (EC 1.6.4.2) and glutathione S-transferase (EC 2.5.1.18) were assayed, \ntogether with hepatic MDA, and plasma cholesterol.

TBARS in \nother tissues were measured before (basal) or after incubation with iron ascorbate for \nvarious lengths of time. \nBasal TBARS were significantly elevated in several tissues in chicks fed heated \nunsupplemented oils compared to those in chicks fed fresh or a-TA-supplemented \nheated oils. The differences were more pronounced following stimulation of oxidation \nwith Fe ascorbate. The reduced oxidative stability of tissues from chicks fed heated oils \nwas partially offset by supplementation of the diet with a-TA. TBARS numbers in chicks \nfed linseed oil were usually higher than those in chicks fed sunflower oil, possibly \nreflecting greater unsaturation of tissue lipids. The results suggest that dietary per- \noxidized fats promote lipid oxidation in vivo, and increase the a-tocopherol requirement. \nIzaki, Y., Yoshikawa, S. & Uchiyama, M. (1984).

By S. O'FARRELL and M. J. JACKSON, \nDepartment of Medicine, University of Liverpool, PO Box 147, Liverpool L69 3BX \nDietary fatty acids provide the ultimate source of fatty acids in tissue membranes. \nConsumption of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (derived from marine oils) has been linked to a \nlow incidence of heart disease (Herold & Kinsella, 1986), but recent work suggests that \nthe consumption of fish oils renders tissues more susceptible to free radical-mediated \nlipid peroxidation (Hu et al. 1989). Damage to cardiac tissue, induced by ischaemia and \nsubsequent reperfusion, may be mediated by oxygen radical species (Badylak et al. 1987; \nYtrehus et al. 1987) with subsequent peroxidation of cardiac membrane lipids (Ferrari \net al. 1988). We have therefore studied the effect of different dietary lipid regimes on \ntissue peroxidation and the response of the isolated heart to ischaemia-reperfusion- \ninduced damage in the rat. \nGroups of female Wistar rats were fed diets containing 100 g\/kg corn oil, menhaden oil \nor lard for 82 (SD 3) d. The response of isolated hearts to 30 min ischaemia and 120 min \nreperfusion was examined using the Langendorff preparation (Langendorff, 1895). The \nextent of damage was assessed by the measurement of creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2, CK) \nefflux at 15 min intervals following reoxygenation. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by \nmeasurement of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in cardiac tissue. \nThe peak release of CK from reoxygenated hearts of the three groups of animals was \nnot significantly different (mean (SEM) values (n  9) were corn oil 336 (83); menhaden oil \n272 (76); lard 406 (190) mu130 min per mg heart). The TBARS content of the cardiac \nmuscle was significantly (Pc0.05) higher in rats fed the menhaden-oil diet (mean (SEM) \nvalues were corn oil 1-03 (0.04); menhaden oil 1.21 (0.03); lard 1.08 (0-06) A532\/mg \nmuscle). A similar pattern was obtained for TBARS produced by incubation with FeSO? \n(50 FM) and ascorbate (50 pM), (mean (SEM) values were corn oil 5.18 (0.57); menhaden \noil 12-98 (1-21); lard 3.98 (0.49)). \nTherefore it appears that dietary supplementation with menhaden oil (high in n-3 \npolyunsaturated fatty acids) has a dramatic effect on the susceptibility of cardiac tissue to \nfree radical-mediated lipid peroxidation. However, in this experimental model, this has \nno influence on the susceptibility of the heart to damage induced by ischaemia and \nreperfusion. \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Nutritional Consultative \nPanel of the UK Dairy Industry. \nBadylak, S .

By M. J. \nJACKSON, Department of Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3 B X  \nand R. NEALE and G. NORTON, Department of Applied Biochemistry and Food \nScience, University of Nottingham School of Agriculture, Sutton Bonington \nLE12 5 R D  \nThe fatty acid composition of skeletal muscle membranes appears to be susceptible to \nmodification by long-term variations in dietary fatty acid composition (Neudoerffer & \nLea, 1967; Jackson et al. 1988). Modification of muscle fatty acid composition to \nincreasing unsaturation may influence muscle eicosanoid metabolism and exacerbate the \ndamage response of muscle to a standardized damaging stress (Jackson et al. 1988). \nTrans fatty acids (tFA) derived from partially-hydrogenated oils and ruminant fats form \na variable part of the human diet and have been recognized to influence linoleic acid and \neicosanoid metabolism (Kinsella et al. 1988). We have therefore studied the effect of t F A  \nsupplements on skeletal muscle membrane function and viability in response to a \nstandardized stress. \nGroups of female Wistar rats (50-60 g) were fed either a casein-based diet containing \n25% of dietary energy as tram 18:l (t18:1), or a control diet with equivalent fat, but no \nt18:l .  Following mating, female offspring of these animals were fed the same diet until \nsacrificed at approximately 60 g body-weight. Soleus muscles were rapidly removed and \nplaced in an in vitro incubation system as previously described (Jones et al. 1983). \nProstaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was assessed following treatment with the calcium \nionophore A23187 (20 p ~ ) ,  and the effect of excess contractile activity on muscle \ndamage was assessed by measurement of creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2, CK) release \nfollowing 30 min of repetitive tetanii, stimulated electrically (at 30 V for 0.5 sec every 2 \nsec) via platinum electrodes. \nMean peak release of PGE2 from muscles from tFA-fed animals was 2020 (SEM 632) \npg\/30 min per muscle, which was not significantly different from control muscles (2400 \n(SEM 906)). Muscle weights did not differ between the two groups. Mean peak CK \nrelease following stimulation (204 (SEM 42) mU\/30 min per muscle) from tFA- \nsupplemented rats was not significantly different from control animals (215 (SEM 73)). \nAnalysis of the muscle fatty acid composition revealed that up to 10% of the fatty acids in \npolar lipids was ?18:1, but this was also associated with an increase in the 18:2 content in \nthe ?FA-supplemented muscle. \nResults therefore indicate that supplementation of diets with tFA causes substantial \nmodification of skeletal muscle membrane fatty acid composition, but had no effect on \nmuscle membrane function or viability as assessed by prostaglandin production or \nresponse to excess contractile activity. \nThe authors are grateful to Unilever Research, Vlardingen, the Netherlands for \nsupplying the fats used in this study. \nJackson, M.

STEPHEN and BRUCE A. REEDER, Division of Nutrition and \nDietetics and Department of Community Health and Epidemiology, University of \nSaskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada \nFour different types of milk are available to the consumer in the province of \nSaskatchewan, Canada: homogenized (4% fat), 2% (fat), 1% (fat)., and skimmed \n(<0.1% fat). Two independent studies have been used to assess consumer choice in type \nof milk consumed and the reasons for that choice. \nThe Saskatchewan Heart Health Survey (SHHS) investigated risk factors for heart \ndisease in a randon sample of 2168 Saskatchewan residents in 1989. Included in the \nsurvey questionnaire were twelve questions on consumption of foods which are thought \nto influence total intake of fat or dietary fibre, including type of milk consumed. In the \nspring of 1991, a survey was conducted on 271 residents of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan to \ninvestigate changes in milk consumption in the last 5 years, and the reasons for change. \nThe primary goal in this survey was to determine whether health issues influence milk \nchoice. Both surveys were conducted on adults aged 18-74 years, and on equal numbers \nof males and females. Results were analysed using the Chi-square test. \nThe number of subjects consuming each type of milk in the two surveys is as follows: \nSHHS 1989 Saskatoon 1991 \nYO of subjects % of subjects \nM & F  M F M & F  M F \nType of milk (n 2168) 1078) (n 1090) (n 271) (n 135) (n 136) \n~ ~ ~~ \nHomogenized (4% fat) 12.8 14.7 11.2 12.9 16.3 9.6 \n2% fat 50.0 55.0 45.2 44.6 48.9 40.4 \n1% fat 14.2 12.8 16.8 21.8 14.8 28.7 \nSkimmed 13.1 9.4 17.2 16.6 14.1 19.1 \nThese results demonstrate a significant difference between males and females in their \nmilk consumption patterns, more males consuming homogenized and 2% milk and more \nfemales consuming 1% and skimmed milk in both surveys. A significant difference \nbetween the two surveys is probably due to the period between them, in that 1% milk \nwas newly introduced in 1989, when the SHHS was conducted. \nIn the Saskatoon survey, respondents were asked if they had changed their milk type \nin the last 5 years and, if so, why. They were given nine possible reasons, ranging from \ntaste, cost and availability to health reasons such as body-weight control, control of \nserum cholesterol or because of the fat content of the milk. Of the 121 individuals who \nhad changed in the last 5 years, 83% changed to a lower fat milk, the main reason for \nwhich was health, particularly mentioning fat content of the milk. Males and females \ndiffered in reasons for change, males being more concerned with control of serum \ncholesterol, females more with weight control. Fourteen per cent of those changing to \nlow-fat milk were previously skimmed-milk drinkers, supporting the opinion that 1% \nmilk is easier for many individuals to consume than skimmed milk. \nThese studies indicate that the population of Saskatchewan is consuming mainly 2% or \nlower fat milk, that 1% milk has a growing popularity and that health concerns are the \nmajor motivator of change. \nVol. 51 M E E T I N G  OF 27-30 A U G U S T  1991 17A \nThe influence of type of milk and breakfast cereal consumption on daily intake of fat and \nnon-starch polysaccharide in university students. By ALISON M. STEPHEN, WENDY \nJ. DAHL and GLYNIS M. SIEBER, Division of Nutrition and Dietetics, College of \nPharmacy, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada \nIn Canada, four different types of milk are available to the consumer: homogenized (4% \nfat), 2% (fat), 1% (fat) and skimmed (<0.1% fat). One per cent milk was introduced \ninto the province of Saskatchewan in January 1989. In order to assess whether \nconsumption of a certain type of milk influences daily fat intake, university students in a \nfirst year class have carried out a 24 h recall of their diet in 1988, 1989 and 1990. This \ndietary information was also used to assess whether intake of breakfast cereal had an \ninfluence on daily intake of non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) (dietary fibre). \nTwenty-four hour recalls (452) were analysed for nutrients using the NUTS computer \nprogram (Quilchena, Vancouver) which is based on the Canadian Nutrient File. No \nNorth American nutrient database includes NSP; hence a new computer program, \nFIBREFIND, was developed using values from the UK food tables and supplemented \nwith values from analysis of Canadian foods in our laboratory. Data were analysed using \nanalysis of variance. \nThe average intake of the 452 students was: energy 8.34 MJ (1996 kcal); fat 344% \nenergy; protein 14.8% energy; carbohydrate 50.4% energy. NSP intake was 12.2 g\/d; 5.2 \ng soluble, 7.0 g insoluble.

By JESSICA A.

Little information is available on the \neffect of modification of the intake of fat or sugars on the intake of energy and other \nnutrients. \nChildren aged 2-5 years were randomly selected from the Lothian Child Health \nRegister of six areas of Edinburgh. Of 600 approached by letter, 205 were recruited. \nForty-six subsequently withdrew for \u2018social\u2019 reasons and six surveys were unsuitable for \nuse. The remaining 153 children had a slight bias towards non-manual groups. Fifty-four \nchildren repeated the survey after 12 months. Data were collected by the 7-d weighed \ninventory method between May 1988-April 1990. One researcher visited all mothers at \nhome to explain the study and use of the digital scales. Crockery was weighed before \nmeals, and with any remaining food after meals. Leftovers were also described, and \nspillages recorded, in the food diary.

A strong negative \nrelationship of -0.62 (P<O-OOl) was found between YO energy from sugars and Yo energy \nfrom fat. Y Energy from fat was negatively correlated (P<O.OOl)  with intake of fibre, \niron, thiamin, total folic acid, vitamin C and (P<O.Ol) vitamin Bh, and positively \ncorrelated (P<O-OOl) with intake of protein, vitamin A and vitamin BI;~. YO Energy from \nsugars was negatively correlated (P<O*OOl) with intake of protein and (P<O.O1) vitamins \nD, B g  and B12 and positively correlated (P<O.OOl) with vitamin C ,  due to a strong \nrelationship between intake of sugars and fruit juice. YO Energy from starch was \npositively associated (P<O.OOl) with intake of fibre, Fe, thiamin, vitamin Bh, and total \nfolic acid and negatively correlated (P<O.OOl) with intake of calcium and (P<O.O1) \nvitamin A. \nIn conclusion, the above results imply that the diets of pre-school children taking high \nintakes of fat or high intakes of sugars could be improved by encouraging a higher intake \nof starchy foods, whilst ensuring an adequate intake of Ca and vitamin A.  \nThis study was supported by the British Heart Foundation and the Nutritional \nConsultative Panel of the UK Dairy Industry. \nVol. 51 M E E T I N G  OF 27-30 A U G U S T  1991 19A \nIntake and sources of sugar in the diet of pre-school children.

AHMED, Institute \nof Nutrition and Food Science, University of Dhaka, Dhaka-1000, Bangladesh and \nB. MARGETTS and A.  A. JACKSON, Department of Human Nutrition, University of \nSouthampton, Bassett Crescent East, Southampton SO9 3TU \nVitamin A deficiency, one of the most common nutritional deficiencies in the world, is \nthought to be caused primarily by a dietary deficiency. However, infection may also \ncontribute to the disorder and an association has been drawn between deficiency and \ninfection with intestinal helminths, especially ascariasis. Ascariasis has been said to cause \nmalabsorption of vitamin A, based upon the change in the concentration of retinol in \nperipheral blood following an oral loading dose. In very few studies have direct measures \nbeen made of the losses of vitamin A in stool. We were interested to know whether \nascariasis caused increased losses of retinol in the stool, and whether these losses could \nbe attributed to accumulation of the vitamin by the parasite. \nIn twenty-four children aged 5-10 years from an urban slum area, a quantitative count \nfor ascaris eggs in a 24 h stool was used to determine worm burden. In ten children with a \nrange of worm burdens, a vitamin A absorption test was carried out: a single oral dose of \nretinol (as palmitate, 12 mg) was given and stools were collected for the next 48 h. The \nretinol content of the total stool was determined by high performance liquid chroma- \ntography (HPLC) (Ahmed et al. 1990). \nFor the ten children the median worm burden was 804 eggs\/g (range nil to 8353). The \nmedian total excretion of retinol in the stool over a 48 h period was 31 pg (range 10 to \n108 pg). Hence the median apparent absorption of retinol was 99.7% (range 99.05 to \n99.91%). Long transformation of the worm burden excluded one individual with no eggs \nin the stool and a relatively-low apparent absorption for retinol(99.24%). For the other \nnine cases, there was a highly significant inverse relationship between the log worm \nburden and the apparent absorption of retinol ( P  = 0.017, r -0.76). In children being \ntreated for ascaris, male and female worms were isolated from stool and the retinol \ncontent determined by HPLC. Retinol could not be detected in any of the worms \nisolated. \nA significant relationship has been demonstrated between retinol in stool and the \nburden of infection with ascaris, but in all children less than 1% of the oral retinol load \nwas recovered in the stool. Therefore, it cannot be said that these children malabsorbed \nretinol. Retinol could not be detected in the asacarids and, therefore, there was no \nevidence that the worms preferentially accumulated available retinol. All of the children \nin this study had a marginal-to-deficient retinol status and avidly retained the oral dose of \nretinol. There is the need to repeat the observations in retinol-replete individuals. We \nhave been unable to substantiate the claim that ascariasis causes malabsorption of \nvitamin A. \nThis work was supported by Nestle Nutrition Research Grant Programme and the \nGeoffrey Taylor Memorial Fund. \nAhmed, F., Ellis, J., Murphy, J..

To study possible mechanisms for this effect, \nserum retinol and serum and tear immunoglobulins were measured in a subgroup of \nGhanaian children (6-60 months old) participating in a randomized, double-blind study \nof the effect on morbidity and mortality of 60 mg retinol(200 000 i.u.) as palmitate every \n4 months. Before supplementation, 16% of the children had serum retinol levels in the \ndeficient range (<0.35 pM), 52% in the marginal range (0.351-0.7 pM), and 32% in the \nadequate range (>0.701 pM). \nAge-adjusted means (with their standard deviations (SD)) of immunoglobulin levels \nmeasured by ELISA using antibodies against the individual class heavy chains in serum \n(mg\/ml) and tears (Fg\/mg protein) at baseline and 4 months after treatment with vitamin \nA or placebo are shown below for children in each range of serum retinol level. \n<0.35 0\u2019351-0.7 >0.701 \nSerum retinol level (PM) Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD \nBaseline \nSerum IgG (mglml) 8.8 2.0 7.7 2.0 6.8 2.0 \nIgA (mdml) 0.75 0.31 0.68 0.33 0.40 0.33 \nIgM (mglrnl) 0.74 0.27 0.63 0.29 0.56 0.29 \nI 1  10 13 13 \n4 months \nSerum IgG (mg\/ml) 9.2 3.9 10.1 3.6 9.3 3.7 \nIgM (mdml) 0.51 0.26 0.46 0.25 0.52 0.25 \nTear IgG (pg\/mg) 11 30 51 28 44 28 \nIgA \nIgA (mg\/ml) 0.81 0.47 0.52 0.44 0.51 0 4 4  \n13 25 32 23 36 23 \nn 7 25 16 \nSerum IgG and IgA tended to be higher in children with lower serum concentrations in \nboth groups although age-adjusted correlations were significant only for baseline samples \n(IgG: r-0.46, P=0-018: IgA: r-0.46, P=0.021).

Few workers have looked at the \neffect of the menstrual cycle or the contraceptive pill on the metabolism of nutrients. \nSix healthy women aged between 23-28 years, three of whom were and three of whom \nwere not taking an oral contraceptive pill (a low dosage combination pill of 30 pg \noestrogen and 0.15 progesterone), were studied over the period of a menstrual cycle. \nFasted, venous blood was taken on every 3rd day of the menstrual cycle and plasma \nvitamin A and E was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Total \nplasma cholesterol was measured enzymically at 500 nm on samples from days 4, 10, 16 \nand 25, and on days 28 and 34 from subjects who had a menstrual cycle of greater than 28 \nd. Each individual\u2019s habitual intake of vitamins A and E and cholesterol was measured \nfrom a weighed food intake for the duration of the menstrual cycle. \nThe mean plasma vitamin A and E levels of the group (pmoV1) were 1.95 (SD 0.61) \nand 23.31 (SD 6.25) respectively. When the group was divided into pill and non-pill \ntakers it was found that pill takers consistently had a significantly higher plasma vitamin \nA (P<0-0001) and vitamin E level (P<0.002) compared to non-pill takers.

This difference was not significant. \nDespite their lower plasma vitamin A, the non-pill takers were ingesting significantly \nmore vitamin A compared with the pill takers (P<0.05). The mean vitamin A intake of \nthe non-pill takers was 1246.0 (SD 579.0) pg\/d compared with 809.3 (SD 536-7) for the pill \ntakers; one pill taker was a non-meat eater. \nThe effect of the menstrual cycle on plasma levels of vitamins A and E was also \nassessed. There was no significant difference in the plasma level of vitamin E during the \nmenstrual cycle for either pill or non-pill takers. There was, however, a significant rise \n(P<0.05) in the plasma level of vitamin A for the group from week 3 to week 4 of the \nmenstrual cycle. This was shown to be significant (P<0.01) for the pill takers but not the \nnon-pill takers. \nIt would appear that oral contraceptive pills influence the metabolic handling of \nvitamin A. Given the important role played by retinoids in cellular function, this \ndifference should be explored in greater detail. \nVol. 51 MEETING O F  27-30 AUGUST 199 1 23A \nUnusual behaviour of a vitamin BIZ-binder, Transcobalamin 1, in cattle plasma. By J .  \nPRICE, S. G, BARRIE and S .  UENO, Rowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, \nAberdeen AB2 9SB \nThe concentration of vitamin B12 in plasma or serum is a reliable indicator of vitamin BI3 \nstatus in man and the sheep, but growth-response trials have failed to establish critical \ndiagnostic values for cattle. The reasons for this are uncertain but it has been suggested \n(Carlos et al. 1987) that microbiological and radioisotope dilution assays, which function \nsatisfactorily with human and ovine samples, are incapable of measuring the total \nvitamin Bl2 present in bovine plasma. Since denaturation of plasma vitamin B 12-binders \n(Transcobalamins, Tc), with release of the free vitamin, is a primary requirement in all \ncurrent vitamin B12 assays, we have separated the binders in cattle and sheep plasma by \ngel filtration and identified them by comparison of their properties with those of binders \n(reviewed Allen, 1975) which have been fully characterized in man. \nUnsaturated binders in cattle, sheep and human plasmas were labelled directly by \nequilibration with 57Co-cyanocobalamin and separated by chromatography on Sephadex \nG150; their elution characteristics (VJV,) and apparent molecular weights (MW, x lo3 \nDaltons) are shown in the Table. \nHuman Cattle Sheep \nBinder V,No MW V,No MW V,IVO MW \nTcO 1.00 >200 1.00 >200 not detected \nTcl 1.28 103 1.30 96 not detected \nTc2 1.65 37 1.62 40 1.58 44 \nSince failure to detect TcO and Tcl in sheep plasma may be due to an inability to label \nthese binders directly if already fully saturated, plasma samples were dialysed against 7.5 \nM guanidinium chloride to remove native cobalamin and its analogues, then against 0.2 M \nphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) before labelling. Despite a marked increase in label bound to \nTcO, 1 and 2 in human and cattle plasma, Tc2 remained the only binder detected in \nsheep. \nPrior to microbiological or competitive binding assay, displacement of vitamin B n  \nfrom binders in human plasma is normally carried out by heating at 100-120\" for 15-30 \nmin in the presence of cyanide (20 p M ) .  The effectiveness of this treatment was verified \nby gel filtration, labelled vitamin being displaced from all binders in human and sheep \nplasma. Although the vitamin was also displaced from cattle Tc2, a substantial \nproportion of the label, equal to the sum that bound to TcO and Tcl, chromatographed as \na single, unidentified high molecular weight complex. \nThe abnormal behaviour of the cattle Tcl-Bl2 complex under conditions resulting in \ncomplete release of the vitamin from binders in human and sheep plasma, suggests that \nvitamin B12 concentrations in cattle plasma are likely to be underestimated by current \nassay procedures if Tcl is quantitatively important as a vitamin Bwbinder in the bovine. \nAllen.

Diets contained 6.6 mg Cukg diet. \nAfter 8 weeks the rats were killed and the activities of the Cu-dependent enzymes, \ncytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1, CCO) and superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1, \nCuZnSOD) were measured in the liver. Cu content and CCO activity were also \nmeasured in the heart and kidney whilst erythrocyte SOD and plasma caeruloplasmin \n(EC 1.16.3.1, Cp) provided further indices of Cu status.

BEATTIE, \nDivision of Biochemical Sciences, Rowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen \nAB2 9SB \nA recent study with postmenopausal women volunteers suggests that changing dietary \nintake of boron from 0.25 to 3.25 mg boron\/d under conditions of Mg deficiency \nsignificantly increases plasma oestradiol levels (Nielsen et al. 1987). The current study \nwas designed to test in vivo, the in vitro finding, that borates inhibit catechol oestrogen \nmethylation (J. H. Beattie and E. Weersink, unpublished results), and the proposal that \nthis perturbation in oestrogen catabolism could influence the circulating level and \nmetabolic fate of the major oestrogens. \nTen adult female rats which had been fed a diet low in boron (CO.1 mg B\/kg) for 7 d \nand then either the same diet or a diet supplemented with boron (40 mg B\/kg) for a \nfurther 5 d were ovariectomized to remove endogenous sources of oestradiol and were \nimplanted with slow-release devices containing [3H]oestradiol. After recovery from the \noperation the animals were maintained on the same diet and 24-h urine collections, \nwhich were preserved in an acetate-ascorbic acid buffer, were made over a period of 7 d. \nUrinary oestrogens were separated into conjugated, free and catechol forms using \nchemical extraction and enzymic techniques. Most radioactivity was detected in the \nconjugated oestrogen fraction and the dietary intake of boron had no significant \ninfluence on the distribution of tritium between conjugated, free and catechol oestrogen \nfractions. \nProportion (mean % with SD, n 5) of radioactivity in fractions from urine of rats \ncontinuously dosed with [3H]oestradiol and fed a low- or high-boron diet \nFree oestrogens \nConjugated \noestrogens Non-catechol Catechol \nBoron intake \n(mdkg) Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD \n<o. 1 79.8 3.3 10.8 1.9 9.4 2.3 \n40 80.1 1.1 10.9 1.7 9.0 1.9 \nUnder these study conditions, it is clear that a boron intake of 40 mg\/kg diet has no \nsignificant effect on oestrogen excretion in ovariectomized rats. This conclusion supports \nevidence from separate studies that boron does not influence plasma sex steroid levels in \nrats (J. H. Beattie and A. Macdonald, unpublished results), although there is a marginal \neffect on bone growth which may be hormonally related (Beattie & Macdonald, 1991). \nBeattie, J. H. & Macdonald, A. (1991).

By C. BOLTON-SMITH, M. WOODWARD and \nH. TUNSTALL-PEDOE, Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, University of Dundee, \nNinewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee DD1 9SY \nLow tissue 18:2n-6 levels may be objective markers for coronary heart clisease (CHD) \nrisk (Wood et al. 1987). Thus assessing the relationship between diet and tissue fatty acid \ncomposition is pertinent. Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) have not been used to \nlook at 18:2n-6 intake, probably because of the suspect adequacy of the fatty acid \ncompositional data and the lack of fat biopsy and dietary data in the same population to \nprovide validation. \nAs part of a cross-sectional study of risk factors for CHD in Scottish men and women \n(40-59 years) FFQ data were collected (Bolton-Smith et al. 1991) and approximately \n4000 outer upper-arm fat biopsies were taken using P 3 mm syringe. Both adipose and \ndietary 18:2n-6 levels varied by smoking group (Table l ) ,  and correlations between \nadipose and dietary fat variables were poorer in current smokers (Table 2). This suggests \nthat the influence of smoking on the relationship between diet and adipose tissue fatty \nacid composition needs more detailed investigation. The dietary data from the FFQ \nwould appear adequate to detect the previously-reported correlations between diet and \ntissue fatty acids, and confirms the usefulness of the FFQ as an epidemiological tool. \nTable 1.

MORGAN, \nThe Scottish Agricultural College, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JG and \nR. C. NOBLE, M. COCCHI and R. MCCARTNEY, The Scottish Agricultural College, \nAuchincruive, Ayr KA6 5HW \nThe po1yunsaturated:saturated (P:S) ratio of fatty acids in the British diet should be \nincreased (COMA, 1984). Also certain fatty acids (gammalinolenic (GLA) 18:3n-6, \neicosapentaenoic (EPA) 20:5n-3 and docosahexaenoic 22:6n-3) have beneficial effects on \nhealth and increased dietary supply could be advantageous (Sanders, 1988). This \nexperiment attempted to manipulate the composition of pig meat lipid by dietary means. \nForty pigs (ten per treatment) were offered, from 25 kg live weight, one of four diets \nbased on barley and soya-bean meal and containing per kg (1) 50 g tallow, (2) 50 g \nsoya-bean oil, (3) 50 g soya-bean oil + 7.5 g GLAoil (Sturge Biochemicals, containing \n170 g 18:3n-6\/kg fatty acids) or (4) 50 g soya-bean oil + 9.5 g EPAnoil (Seven Seas Ltd, \ncontaining 212 g 20:5n-3 and 145 g 22:6n-3\/kg fatty acids). Five pigs were slaughtered \nfrom each group at 70 and 100 kg live weight and samples were taken from the \nlongissimus dorsi and semitendinosus muscles. The fatty acid composition of the lipids \nextracted from the semitendinosus muscle at 70 kg live weight is shown in the Table. \nP:S ratio and fatty acid composition (g\/kg total) of the semitendinosus muscle \n1S:311-6 \nDiet P:S ratio 18:O 1S:1 18:2n-6 +n-3 20:4n-6 22:511-3 22:6n-3 \n1 0.56 112 44 1 139 15.1 17.9 5.4 4.5 \n2 1.08 106 342 259 26.4 29.6 6.4 3.1 \n3 0.99 110 344 238 24.5 30.6 5.4 3.2 \n4 1.00 103 351 247 21.4 15.6 9.6 8.0 \nSD 0.116 11.3 23.7 22.1 4.68 6.31 1.66 1.12 \nResults were similar for the longissimus dorsi muscle and for pigs at 100 kg live weight. \nThe P:S ratio was increased markedly by feeding soya-bean oil. Importantly, the \nconsiderable increase in polyunsaturates was achieved without obvious detriment to the \nphysical or eating quality of the meat. The effects of the GLAoil on content of \n18:3n-6+n-3 and 20:4n-6 were not consistent and showed no improvement over \nsoya-bean oil alone. The EPAnoil resulted in 8.3 (SD 0.88) g 20:5n-3\/kg total fatty acid in \nthe semitendinosus muscle but none was detected with the other three treatments. The \ncontents of 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were increased by feeding EPAnoil. It is concluded that \nwith respect to both the standard C18 acids and the less abundant C20 and C22 acids the \nhealth image of pig meat can be improved by manipulation of the muscle fat by dietary \nmeans. \nThis experiment was funded by the Beretta Company of Italy. \nCOMA (1984).

SAHA and J .  S. H.  TAY, Department of Paediatrics, National \nUniversity of Singapore, 5 Lower Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 0511 \nThe incidence of, and mortality from, coronary artery disease is very low in the Chinese \nand Japanese compared to that in the Caucasians and Asiatic Indians (Saha. 1987). \nLower levels of serum total cholesterol have been reported in the Japanese, Chinese and \nKoreans as well as lower Apo B levels (Kesteloot et al. 1985; Saha, 1987). However, \nserum total cholesterol level in the Chinese of Singapore has not been found to be \nsignificantly different from that in Asiatic Indians and Caucasians. The present gener- \nation of the Singapore population are more affluent and 'Westernized' in their dietary \nhabits. It was therefore thought that a comparative study of serum lipid and apolipo- \nproteins in the Chinese of Singapore and a group of Chinese foreign workers from \nmainland China would provide some insight whether these differences in serum lipids in \nthe Oriental could be of genetic or environmental origin. \nChinese males (n  167) recruited as foreign workers formed the sample from mainland \nChina. They were studied on their arrival during the mandatory medical examination for \nemployment as foreign workers. Singapore Chinese males (n 166) of comparable \nsocio-economic background were selected at random from the same source. Serum lipids \nand apolipoproteins were estimated following the methods of Saha (1987), and LDL- \ncholesterol from total cholesterol-(HDL-cholesterol+ (triacylglyceroVS)). \nAnthropometry, serum lipids and apolipoproteins in the Chinese of Singapore and \nmainland Chin a \nMainland (n 167) Singapore (n 166) P \n- (adjusted for \nMean SE Mean \nAge \nHeight (crn) \nWeight (kg) \nBody mass index (BMI) (kg\/m2) \nTotal cholesterol (mmoVI) \nHDL-cholesterol (rnmolll) \nTriacylglycerol (mrnolfl) \nLDL-cholesterol (mmol\/l) \nApolipoprotein A1 (rng%) \nApolipoprotein A2 (mg%) \nApolipoprotein B (mg%) \n21.6 0.15 \n58.0 0.50 \n19.8 0.15 \n3.55 0.06 \n0.94 0.02 \n1.26 0.05 \n2.05 0.06 \n1314 4.04 \n44.6 1.22 \n71.2 1.89 \n171.2 0.41 \n26.1 \n169.7 \n63.2 \n22.4 \n4.84 \n1.15 \n1.05 \n3.20 \n135.8 \n44.1 \n70.7 \nSE \n0.42 \n1.85 \n1.20 \n0.62 \n0.07 \n0.03 \n0.04 \n0.07 \n4.36 \n1.03 \n1.57 \n<0.001 \nNS \n<0.001 \n<0.001 \n<0-001 \n<0.001 \nCO.01 \n<0.001 \nNS \nNS \nNS \nThe higher serum triacylglycerol in the mainland Chinese may be due to their higher \nintake of dietary carbohydrates.

ROSE and R.  C. COTTRELL, Leatherhead Food Research \nAssociation, Randalls Road, Leatherhead, Surrey KT22 7RY \nDietary advice designed to reduce fat intake to under 35% of food energy normally \nfocuses on foods such as meat, fats and dairy products, which contribute most fat to the \nnational \u2018average\u2019 diet. Advice better targeted to those with high-fat diets would be more \nefficient, but is hampered by the lack of simple-but-reliable means of identifying such \nindividuals and the dietary habits associated with their high-fat energy intake. \nIn this project the weighed 7-d diet records from the survey of British schoolchildren \n(Department of Health, 1989) were used to evaluate several statistical methodologies for \nthe interpretation of multidimensional dietary data. The aim of the project was to \nidentify whether individuals with high-fat diets (e.g. over 40% fat energy) have dietary \nhabits which allow them to be characterized and differentiated from individuals with \nlow-fat diets (<35% fat energy). Principal components analysis, used to identify dietary \nbehaviours in other recent studies (Barker et al. 1990; Gregory et al. 1990), identified a \nnumber of patterns in each dataset. Only one component among the schoolchildren, \nassociated with avoidance of breakfast cereals, was positively correlated with fat energy. \nCanonical discriminant analysis, to our knowledge not used previously for these types of \ndietary data, produced a classification into three fat energy groups from intake data on \nten foods out of the thirty-eight in the study, the ranking of which differed slightly \nbetween the populations. \nTop ten foods in the discriminant analysis (in decreasing order of importance) \nSchoolgirls S c h o o 1 boys \n- + - + \nButter Butter \nMargarine Margarine \nBread Bread \nSugar Sugar \nSoft drinks Meat \nBreakfast cereals Eggs \nMeat \nEggs Soft drinks \nCrisps Crisps \nCheese Cheese \nBreakfast cereals \nWe conclude that; 1, canonical discriminant analysis is a valid tool for identifying fat \nenergy intake above 40% or below 35% with approximately 65% accuracy and less than \n5% misclassification of extremes; 2, negative predictors are as important as positive \npredictor foods in assessing fat energy; 3 ,  foods such as milk and chips, which contribute \nsignificantly to the (child) population intake of fat, do not necessarily discriminate well \nbetween high- and low-fat consumers. \nThe support of MAFF in funding the project is gratefully acknowledged. \nBarker, M.

TOMKINS', 'Nutrition \nResearch Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, \nLondon WCI, 2Department of Neurology, Middlesex Hospital, London Wl  and \n3Department of Geriatric Medicine, St Pancras Hospital, 4 St Pancras Way, London \nN W l  \nParkinson's disease (PD) is a disabling neurological disorder that is characterized by \ntremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and disturbances of posture and balance. Although it is \noften noted that patients with PD tend to be thin, only two studies have reported this in \nthe literature (Vardi et al. 1976; Yapa et al. 1989). It has, however, been shown that some \nelderly-onset patients with PD have increased energy expenditure at rest (Levi et al. \n1990). This could contribute to the thinness observed. The present study investigated \ndietary intake and nutritional status in a group of subjects with middle-aged onset PD. \nParticular attention was given to assessment of protein intake as many patients are \nadvised to reduce the protein content of the diet in order to maximize the efficacy of their \ndrug treatment. \nForty-five patients (nineteen female, twenty-six male) ranging from 44-83 (mean 62) \nyears were nutritionally assessed using anthropometry and dietary questionnaires. \nWeight loss occurring since the onset of PD was seen in 58% of the patients and of these, \n38% had a self-reported loss >12.7 kg (2 stone). A body mass index (BMI) of <20 was \nseen in 29% of the patients. The range of both weight loss and BMI are shown in the \nTable. \nWeight loss (kg) None 0-6.4 6.5-12.7 12.8-19.1 >19.1 \n% of patients 42 15.5 20 15.5 7 \n% of patients 9 20 51 20 \nBMI (weight\/height?) <l%0 18.0-20.0 20.1-25.0 225.1 \nVarious factors affecting dietary intake were assessed. Of the patients who were \npreviously able to shop for food, 50% were prevented from doing so as a result of their \nPD and, of those who could previously cook, 53% were no longer able to. Advice to \nfollow a protein-restricted diet was given to 40% of the patients but compensatory \ndietary advice was not given. In fact only 44% of those who followed the advice found \nthe diet to be of any benefit to their neurological state. Other factors influencing dietary \nintake were: difficulty in swallowing (44%), loss of taste or smell, or both, (38%), \nchewing difficulties (36%), loss of appetite (24%) and nausea (22%). Vitamin or mineral \nsupplements without any specific dietary instruction were taken by 31% of the patients \nand 13% (all of whom had a BMI <20) took daily high-energy-protein drinks. \nThis study shows that PD patients are subject to considerable weight loss. The \ncombination of increased energy expenditure, decreased ability to purchase and prepare \nfood, advice to restrict protein intake and difficulty in eating is a serious problem for \nthese patients. It is suggested that more careful, specific attention to these aspects of \nnutrition should be incorporated into the management of patients with PD. \nWe acknowledge the support of the Parkinson's Disease Society and the assistance of the \nmedical staff at the Neurology Department of the Middlesex Hospital. \nLevi, S., Cox, M., Lugon, M., Hodkinson, M. & Tomkins.

An anthropometric study of \neighty-five patients. By H. S.  MARK US^, A. TOMKINS~ and G. M.  STERN^, \n\u2018Department of Neurology, Middlesex Hospital, Mortimer Street, London \nWIN 8AA and 2Clinical Nutrition Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical \nMedicine, London WCl  E 7HT \nWeight loss appears to be a common feature of Parkinson\u2019s disease but its incidence and \ncause have been little studied. Contributing factors might include a reduced energy \nintake due to social isolation, chewing or swallowing difficulties or impaired gastro- \nintestinal function, or an increased energy expenditure due to involuntary movements \n(tremor and dyskinesias) or increased muscle tone during \u2018off\u2019 periods. Anthropometric \nindices (weight, height, triceps and biceps skinfold thickness, and mid-arm circum- \nference (MAC)) were recorded in eighty-five individuals (fifty-one male, thirty-four \nfemale) with L-Dopa-responsive Parkinson\u2019s disease. Body mass index (BMI), mean \nskinfold thickness (MSFT) and MAC were correlated with the following clinical features: \nduration of disease, clinical disease stage (Hoehn and Yahr, 1967), living alone, chewing \nand swallowing difficulties, tremor grade (1-4) and dyskinesia grade (1-4), and presence \nof prolonged \u2018freezing\u2019. \nMean values (sD) in all patients, and those with early (4 years) and late (>15 years) \ndisease are documentated in the Table. \nAll Early Late \nMale n 51 n 18 n 11 \nBMI (kg\/m2) 23.0 (3.3) 25.1 (2.9) 21.3 (2.7) \nMSFT (cm) 8.1 (2.6) 9.8 (2.0) \n29.1 (2.7) 23.4 (2.1) MAC (cm) 27.9 (2.5) \n8.0 (2.1) \nFemale n 34 n 16 n 8  \nBMI (kg\/m2) 22.5 (4.6) 24.4 (5.1) 19.2 (2.7) \nMSFT (cm) 12.4 (5.2) 15.1 (5.2) 8.4 (3.4) \nMAC (cm) 26.2 (3.6) 28.1 (3.5) 22.9 (2.8) \nWithin the male group a significant (P<O+Ol) negative correlation was found between \nall three anthropometric indices and dyskinesia grade. BMI and MSFT were significantly \nrelated to Hoehn and Yahr stage, duration of disease, episodes of prolonged freezing, \nand chewing difficulties. In contrast, no relationship was found between derived arm \nmuscle circumference and these clinical variables, suggesting that the weight loss was \npredominantly body fat rather than lean body mass. No correlation was found with living \nalone, swallowing difficulties and tremor grade. Dyskinesia grade, Hoehn and Yahr \nstage and disease duration were interrelated variables but the negative correlation \nbetween anthropometric variables and dyskinesia grade was strongest. Multiple regres- \nsion analysis revealed that BMI and MSFT were only independently related to dyskinesia \ngrade ( R 0 . 0 5 ) .  Within the female group similar correlations were found except that no \ncorrelation was found with episodes of prolonged freezing. \nHoehn, M. M. & Yahr. M. D. (1967).

We have examined two populations with different chronic \ndietary habits to examine whether a difference in their acid-base status exists. Healthy \nfemales ( n  33) volunteered for the present experiment which was approved by the local \nethics committee. Twenty of these subjects ate meat on a regular basis; the remaining \nthirteen subjects were designated as vegetarians, although two occasionally ate fish. All \nsubjects completed a 7-d weighed food intake which was analysed using a computer- \nbased system of food composition tables (Paul & Southgate, 1978). On two separate \noccasions during this week, subjects reported to the laboratory following an overnight \nfast, and arterialized-venous blood samples were obtained for the determination of \nacid-base status. A 24 h urine collection was completed by each subject and later \nanalysed for pH and total acid. Each subject's height, weight and % body fat were \nmeasured. Statistical analysis was by Student's t test for paired and unpaired data; \nsignificance was declared at the P<0-05 level. \nUrinary acid-base \nDietary intake Blood acid-base \nTotal \nOmnivore Mean 9.0\" 69.9\" 88.3\" 278.8\" 7.41* 19.7 -3.8 6.26 48.9\" \nSD 1.5 8.8 18.0 69.1 0.02 1.3 1.2 0.50 20.3 \nVegetarian Mean 7.1 55.1 654 227.6 7.40 19.9 -3.8 6.45 35.3 \nSD 1.1 10.0 22.2 26.1 0.01 1.3 1.1 0.56 23.3 \nDaily dietary intake and acid-base status of the two groups: * denotes a significant difference between the \nmeans. \nAlthough there was no difference in body-weight and % body fat between the two \ngroups, significant differences did exist in dietary intake.

PRENTICE, Dunn Clinical Nutrition Centre, 100 \nTennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1 QL \nDietary surveys may underestimate 'habitual' food intake. This conclusion rests on \nprinciples of energy physiology. FAO\/WHO\/UNU (1985) expressed energy require- \nments as multiples of basal metabolic rate (BMR). That for a sedentary lifestyle is given \nas 1.55 x BMR. Since most dietary surveys also measure height and weight, mean BMR \ncan be calculated from equations (Schofield, 1985) and related to the reported mean \nenergy intake (EIBMR). \nEllBMR \n8, Diet history; 8, diet recall; @, diet records. EI\/BMR in published diet surveys of adults. Fig. \nThe distribution of EI\/BMR in sixty-eight subgroups from thirty-seven studies of \nadults in nine countries of Europe and America, including sixteen major UK studies \nsince 1979, fourteen European studies and six of the best known US epidemiological \nstudies (Black et al. 1992), ranging from n 10 to n 10 000 and including different survey \nmethods, is shown. In only seventeen groups does EI\/BMR reach or exceed 1.55. It is \nimprobable that all intakes below 1.55 X BMR are valid measures of 'habitual' intake, \neven for very sedentary lifestyles. Intakes above 1.55 x BMR may be underestimates of \nintakes of physically-active groups. \nDietary records, weighed or in household measures, give varied values for EI\/BMR; \nrecall method tends to give lower and diet history higher values. EI\/BMR is higher for \nmen (mean 1.49 (SD 0.17)) than women (mean 1.32 (SD 0.17)) indicating either better \ncompliance or higher activity levels. \nEvidence to indicate whether bias to underestimation is an observer effect operating \nequally on all subjects, or from identifiable subgroups, or to a continuum of good-to-bad \nrecords is scanty. At present data have to be taken at face value while maintaining a \ncritical awareness of possible misinterpretations. \nPractical steps for evaluating future studies could include: estimation of individual \nEI\/BMR and study of means for groups and subgroups; questions on occupational and \nleisure activity; questions to identify weight conscious individuals; and inclusion of \nexternal validation procedures in protocol when submitting applications for funds (Black \ner al. 1992; Goldberg et al. 1992). \nBlack, A.

It has been suggested that diets deficient in minerals may result in increased \nenergy expenditure and decreased efficiency of utilization of energy (Kleiber, 1945). The \neffect of a K-deficient diet on energy utilization has been studied in rats. Male Wistar \nrats, 80-100 g body-weight, were randomly assigned to four groups and housed \nindividually. Time 0 rats were killed at the start of the study as a reference. K-adequate \nrats (K-AD) were given a prepared diet containing potassium chloride, 62.7 mmol Wkg \ndiet. Deficient animals (K-DEF) were given the same diet ad Zib., with K excluded from \nthe mineral mixture. A group of rats were pair-fed (K-AD-PF) the adequate diet to the \nintake of the K-deficient animals. For 14 d,  body-weight and food intake were measured \ndaily. The energy content of the diet and the dried carcass was determined by ballistic \nbomb calorimetry. Energy expenditure was derived as the difference between gross \nenergy intake and carcass energy gain. \nGroup \nK-AD \nSE \nK-DEF \nSE \nK-AD-PF \nSE \nWeight \n(g) \n186a \n5 \n131b \n4 \n145c \n4 \nT-E-I \n(MJ) \n4.45a \n0.07 \n3.13b \n0.10 \n3.20\" \n0.12 \nCarc-E-gain TEE EE \n(MJ) (MJ) (MJ\/100 g) \n0.52\" 3.93\" 2.12a.b \n0.04 0.05 0.04 \n0.20b 2-94h 2.24a \n0.03 0.07 0.03 \n0.37\" 2.83b 1.95\" \n0.05 0.12 0.05 \nE density \n(kJ\/g) \n7.4a \n0.5 \n10.3\" \n1.3 \n11.4\" \n1.5 \nT-E-I, total energy intake; Carc-E-gain, carcass energy gain; TEE, total energy expenditure; EE. energy \nANOVA values with the same superscript are not different, P<0.01. \nexpenditure; E density, energy density. \nThe rats on the K-DEF diet had a reduction in food intake and gained significantly less \nweight than the K-AD group. However, the changes in body-weight could not simply be \naccounted for by the reduced intake, as the K-AD-PF group gained weight at a \nsignificantly greater rate than the K-DEF animals. The energy expenditure per 100 g \nbody-weight was not different between the K-AD and K-AD-PF groups, but was \nsignificantly increased in the K-DEF group, by about 15%. There was no significant \ndifference in the carcass energy retained per g of weight gain, and therefore the \ncomposition of the tissue gained was similar amongst the different groups. Specific \nnutrient deficiencies can exert an important effect upon energy requirements. \nDorup, I. & Clausen, T. (1989). British Journal of Nutrition 62,269-284. \nGustafson. A .

By DIANE WRAY-CAHEN, ALAN W. BELL, R. DEAN BOYD and DALE E.  \nB AUMAN, Department of Animal Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA \nExogenous porcine somatotropin (pST) greatly reduces the fat accretion and increases \nprotein accretion rates in pigs. This shift in nutrient partitioning is accompanied by a \ndecrease in insulin sensitivity for whole-body glucose uptake (Wray-Cahen et al. 1990); \nthe relative contribution of metabolic changes in various tissues is unknown. Our \nobjective was to quantify net uptake of glucose, lactate, non-esterified fatty acids \n(NEFA) and oxygen by the hindlimb under normal and hyperinsulinaemic (euglycaemic) \nconditions and to examine the impact of pST on these variables. \nEight pigs (55 (SD 6) kg) received either recombinant pST (120 pg\/kg) or excipient \n(control) for 7 d. Blood flow (via dye dilution) and arterio-venous concentration \ndifferences of metabolites were measured immediately before initiation of treatment \n(day 0) and on day 7 of treatment. The catheterized external iliac arteries and veins \nserved a tissue bed that was approximately 66% muscle and 8% fat. Net uptakes were \nmeasured under basal conditions and during jugular insulin infusions at low (physio- \nlogical, 14 ng\/kg per min) and high (maximal, 360 ng\/kg per min) rates. During insulin \ninfusion, arterial blood glucose was monitored every 5 min and jugular glucose infusion \nrate (GIR) was adjusted to maintain euglycaemia. GIR provides an estimate of \nwhole-body glucose uptake in response to exogenous insulin. \nNet hindlimb uptake \nHindlimb \nInsulin GIR g1ucose:OZ Glucose NEFA \n(ng\/ml) (mgkg per min) quotient (pmoUmin) (pmoVmin) \nDay 7 of \ntreatment Mean sEM Mean SEM Mean SEM Mean SEM Mean SEM \nBasal \nControl 0.48 0.12 - - 1.10 0.20 155 35 5.97 0.44 \n1.34\" 0.24 - - 0.45* 0.18 98 51 -2.15$ 4.66 PST \nControl 0.93 0.09 7.1 0.9 1.76 0.16 290 SO 6.66 1.25 \nPST 1.22* 0.06 1.5* 0.1 0.58* 0.31 120\" 70 -2.07\" 3.02 \nLow insulin \nHigh insulin \nControl 15.56 2.34 24.1 1.7 3.31 0.24 590 68 5.33 0.88 \nPST 16.39 1.06 21.5 2.0 3.82 0.37 737 118 5.27 1.03 \nSignificantly different from control: tP<O.lO, *P<0.05. \nThe pST-induced alterations in hindlimb and whole-body uptake of nutrients were \nonly evident at physiological levels of insulin (basal and low insulin).

(1989) and \npresent values for hindlimb tissue composition. This is consistent with the theory that \npST directs nutrients away from adipose and towards lean tissue growth, by altering the \nresponse of tissues to homeostatic signals. \nDunshea, F.

By c. f\u2019ERSAUD and \nA. A. JACKSON, Department of Human Nutrition and G. WERKMEISTER. \nDepartment of Human Reproduction, University of Southampton, Bmsett Crescent \nEast, Southampton SO9 3TU \nIn the past we have used an increased urinary excretion of 5-0x0-L-proline as an index of \nglycine insufficiency. We have found 5-oxo-~-prolinuria in situations where the \nmetabolic demand for glycine is high, viz during pregnancy (Persaud et al. 1987). Van der \nWerf et al. (1975) have shown in mice that L-dihydro-orotic acid can competitively inhibit \nthe enzyme 5-0x0-L-prolinase. On this basis, Ribes et al. (1987) have speculated that \naccumulated orotic acid or its precursor, L-dihydro-orotic acid, could be the reason for a \nmild 5-oxo-~-prolinuria. Increased urinary excretion of orotic acid occurs in pregnancy \nand we have looked for an association between 5-oxo-~-proline and orotic acid excretion \nin pregnant women to see whether the increased excretion of orotic acid could account \nfor the 5-oxo-~-prolinuria. \nUrine samples (24 h) were collected from seventy-five pregnant women attending the \nantenatal clinic and compared with a control group of twelve non-pregnant women. \n5-0x0-L-proline was isolated by column chromatography and measured enzymically \nafter acid hydrolysis to glutamic acid. Orotic acid was measured coloriinetrically after \ninterfering substances had been removed with a cation-exchange resin. \nOrotic acid (p.mol\/d) 5-Oxoproline (pmolid) \nMedian Range Median Range \n.__ \nNon-pregnant 4.3 24.9 137 29-477 \nPregnant 6-1 1-26 910 40 -2312 \nWilcoxon rank NS P<0~0001 \nNS, not significant. \nThere was no increase in the excretion of 5-0x0-L-proline or orotic acid as pregnancy \nprogressed. However, there was increased urinary orotic acid in forty-six of seventy-five \npregnant women and an increase in urinary 5-0x0-L-proline in fifty-nine of seventy-five \n(beyond the normal range). Regression of urinary 5-0x0-L-proline on orotic acid for all \nthe pregnant women did not show a significant relationship ( r  0.18, P value 0.124), nor \nwhen only the women with raised orotic acid were considered ( r  0.24, P value 0.112). \nTherefore, at most, about 5% of the variability in 5-oxo-~-proline excretion could be \naccounted for by changes in orotic acid excretion. \nChanges in renal function during pregnancy result in a generalized amino aciduria. \nThe increased excretion of 5-oxo-~-proline is greater than can be accounted for by this \nmechanism (Persaud et al. 1987). Although increased orotic acid excretion may \ncontribute to 5-oxo-~-prolinuria, an increased orotic acid level of itself is insufficient to \naccount for the magnitude of the 5-oxoprolinuria seen in normal pregnant women. \nPersaud.

By K. N. FRAYN, D. U. HUDSON, \nK. L. BOULTON and S. W. COPPACK, Sheikh Rashid Diabetes Unit, Radcliffe \nInfirmary, Oxford OX2 6HE \nObesity and anorexia are both associated with disturbances of steroid sex hormone \nconcentrations. Obese men, for instance, have elevated 0estrogen:androgen ratios. This \nmay reflect the fact that adipose tissue is an important site for the peripheral \ninterconversion of steroid hormones. Both the cytochrome-P450-dependent aromatase \n(which converts androgens to oestrogens) and the 17-p hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase \n(EC 1.1.1 -51) (which interconverts androstenedione and testosterone, or oestrone and \noestradiol) are present in adipose tissue. Information on the occurrence of these \nprocesses in vivo is sparse. We have therefore measured arterio-venous differences for \nsome steroid sex hormones across subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. \nSeven men and eight women were studied, in various nutritional states and at various \ntimes of the menstrual cycle. The groups were heterogeneous and included two \npost-menopausal females and one with polycystic ovary syndrome, and one subject with \ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Blood samples were withdrawn from a vein draining \nthe subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue, and from a vein draining a warmed hand \n(\u2018arterialized\u2019) or from a radial artery. The cannulation techniques have been described \npreviously (Frayn et al. 1989). Total plasma concentrations of testosterone, andro- \nstenedione, oestrone and oestradiol were measured by radioimmunoassay after extrac- \ntion with diethyl ether. Within-batch coefficients of variation were: testosterone, males \n3.3%, females 5.7% ; androstenedione, males+females 4.7% ; oestrone, males+females \n3.2% ; oestradial, males+females 6.0%. \nDespite the heterogeneity of the groups, some very consistent findings emerged. \nAlmost all subjects showed increases in oestrone and oestradiol concentrations across the \nadipose tissue (mean (SEM) arterio-venous differences -8 (2) and -22 (7) pmol\/l \nrespectively; P<O-Ol for each hormone by paired t test). In all males but one, \ntestosterone concentration decreased during passage through adipose tissue (arterio- \nvenous difference +0.8 (SEM 0.2) nmoUl, P<0.02); the arterio-venous difference for \ntestosterone was positively related to the arterial concentration ( r  0.70, P0.05). In all \nfemales but one (in whom there was no change) the testosterone concentration increased \n(arterio-venous difference -0.4 (SEM 0.1) nmol\/l, P<0.05). The exchange of andro- \nstenedione was less consistent. The arterialized plasma oestrone concentration was \npositively correlated with body mass index amongst the males ( r  0.85, PO-Ol), despite a \nrelatively narrow range of adiposity (19-3-26.9 kg\/m2). \nWe conclude that subcutaneous adipose tissue is an important site for interconversion \nof steroid hormones, in particular the production of oestrogens. Measurements of \narterio-venous differences (together with blood flow) will provide a useful technique for \ninvestigation of disorders of sex hormone concentrations in obesity and other clinical \nstates. \nWe thank Colin Selby of the City Hospital, Nottingham, for help in setting up the \nradioimmunoassays. \nFrayn, K.

Excretion is greater in children and in patients affected by \nmetabolic bone diseases than in normal adults (Robins ef al. 1991). A pilot study was \ndesigned to quantify different components of within- and between-subject variability. \nUrine collections were obtained from twelve normal healthy children aged 3-5 years, to \nanalyse diurnal and weekly rhythms of excretion, and to assess the rate of excretion at \ndifferent ages. Pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were assayed by high \nperformance liquid chromatography (Black et al. 1988). The mean rates of excretion of \nPYD and DPD calculated from 24 h timed collections were, respectively, 0.22 (SD 0.03) \nand 0.06 (SD 0.02) nmoVmin. Excretion rates were lower in the afternoon (PYD, \n0.14-0.19 nmol\/min; DPD, 0.04-0.05 nmol\/min) than in the morning and night (PYD, \n0.22-0.24 nmol\/min; DPD, 0.06-0.08 nmol\/min). However, only for DPD were the \ndifferences statistically significant. Within-subject variation was 20% on within-day and \n30% on between-day spot samples. Between-day variation was reduced to 20% where \ntimed overnight collections were used. In spite of the large intra-individual variance and \nthe small number of subjects, an age-related significant difference in excretion of PYD \ncould be revealed (Table). \nUrinary excretion of pyridinium cross-links at different ages \nPYD DPD \n(nmol\/mmol creatinine) (nmoUmmol creatinine) \n._ \nAge Mean SD Mean SD \n3 years ( n  4) 168 8 49 8 \n4 years ( n  4) 144 23 42 5 \nS years ( n  4) 128 13 40 8 \nP<O.OS NS \nNS, not significant. \nThese preliminary results indicate that, given this high variability, in order to point out \nthe correlation between cross-link excretion and growth rates, three repeated collections \nwould be needed to reduce the error term of the correlation coefficient to below 10% \n(Liu et al. 1978).

Methods such as skinfold thickness measurement are unreliable, \nwhereas methods such as densitometry, total body electrical conductivity or magnetic \nresonance imaging are not practical. Bioelectrical impedance has recently been shown to \nbe a valid, quick, safe and non-invasive means of body composition analysis in children \nand adolescents (Davies et al. 1988). The use of bioelectrical impedance in infancy has \nnot been reported. \nWe have undertaken a study of the value of bioelectrical impedance to predict total \nbody water (TBW) in VLBW infants, using dilution of the stable isotope H P 0  as a \nstandard. TBW was calculated by the method of Schoeller et al. (1980). Results from \nseventeen studies in eight babies have been obtained. Babies were born at a mean (SD) \ngestational age of 24.9 (1.2) weeks, with a mean birth weight of 760 (64) g. Median \n(range) age at study was 44 (18-76) d, and median (range) weight at study was 1092 \n(661-2116) g. Bioelectrical impedance measurements were made using the Holtain body \ncomposition analyser (Holtain Ltd). Electrodes were placed on the hand and foot, and \nvoltage drop was measured on a further set of electrodes placed 3 cm proximally on the \nforearm and lower leg. TBW was derived from impedance (I) using the association of \nimpedance with length (L2\/I). TBW measured by isotope dilution was highly correlated \n( r  0.96; P<0-0001) with L2\/I. The regression equation of the relationship was TBW = \n0.55 L2\/I+0-094. The possibility was studied that TBW measured by back extrapolation \nof the regression line of l80 concentration against time gives a truer result than the \nplateau method, and that impedance pathway rather than length may be a better \nmeasurement in the prediction equation. The best agreement was given by the plateau \nmethod and length respectively. \nOur results indicate that bioelectrical impedance is a valid, inexpensive, portable, \nrapid and non-invasive means of body composition analysis in VLBW infants. Further- \nmore, it can be used in VLBW infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory \ndisorders. \nDavies, P. S. W. ,  Preece, M. A.,  Hicks, C. J. & Halliday, D. (1988).

MASSEY \nand A. C. MCMAHON, Department of Child Health, University of Manchester \nMedical School, Manchester M13 9PT and D. G. DALGLEISH, Hannah Research \nInstitute, Ayr KA6 5HL \nFinding a satisfactory milk substitute (RMS) on which to rear rat pups artificially has \nproved troublesome and the best available RMS is complicated to produce (Auestad \net al. 1989). The method outlined below is simple and produces a RMS similar to rat\u2019s \nmilk in composition and which gives acceptable survival and growth. \nPasteurized cow\u2019s milk is concentrated by ultrafiltration: this can be achieved on a \nscale of several litres by using a hollow fibre membrane cartridge (UFP-500-D-6, AG \nTechnology, Needham, MA, USA), or on a laboratory scale using an Amicon TCFlOA \ncell and PM30 membrane. The casein, fat and colloidal material are concentrated by a \nfactor of 3 by removing 0.67 volumes of permeate from 1 volume of milk, although some \nserum proteins are lost. Water-soluble vitamins are added to the retentate: 308 mgll \nSolvito (Kabivitrum Ltd., Uxbridge, UK). The calculated composition of the resulting \nRMS is (gll): casein 74.4, whey protein 18.6, total protein 93.0, lactose 42.9, fat 144.0, \nwhich compares favourably with rat\u2019s milk (Auestad et al. 1989). The RMS has excellent \nphysical properties for delivery down the fine tubes used in artificial rearing, being fluid \nand non-viscous. An advantage of this material is that the casein micelles and fat globules \nof the original milk remain intact, so that the formation of a normal coagulum during \ndigestion is likely to be facilitated. Other RMSs contain particles whose structures have \nbeen grossly altered, and which will form abnormal coagula, which may affect digestion \ndeleteriously. \nA variation of this method is to ultrafilter skimmed cow\u2019s milk and to add a mixture of \noils designed to produce a similar fatty acid profile to rat\u2019s milk (Auestad et al. 1989) plus \nwater- and oil-soluble vitamins, and to homogenize the milk at high pressure to prevent \nseparation of the oil. Such preparations were acceptable, but the need for high-pressure \nhomogenization may limit their applicability. \nRat pups have been artificially reared from 5-20 d on RMSs produced by ultrafiltration \nof whole or skimmed cow\u2019s milk (with additions, as above). Survival was as good as, or \nbetter than, for other milk substitutes that we have used (Smart et al. 1984). Growth in \nbody-weight compared with mother-reared pups was satisfactory. After a slight initial lag \n(often encountered in artificial rearing), growth to 20 d was good such that by then there \nwas no significant difference in body-weight between artificially-reared (AR) and \nmother-reared (MR) rats (mean (sD): AR,  40.25 (3.23) and 43.21 (2.93); MR, 38.74 \n(3.23) and 42.12 (3.42) g, in two experiments with a total of twenty AR and twenty-three \nMR rats). There was no significant difference in brain weight at 20 d: AR 1.295 (0.055) \nand MR 1.323 (0.046) g. The timing of eye-opening was normal. \nAuestad, N., Korsak, R. A., Bergstrorn, J.

The yolks of those eggs laid and the follicles still within the \novary were examined at the end of the experiment. The increase in volume of each yolk \nwas used to calculate the total energy content of yolk formed.

JACKSON, Department of Human \nNutrition, University of Southampton, Bassett Crescent East, Southampton \nSO9 3TU \nThe measurement of urea kinetics may be used to characterize the adequacy of dietary \nprotein, in terms of quality and quantity. However, the methods available for measuring \nurea kinetics require a steady metabolic state and are not suitable for application to \nfree-living subjects. Therefore, we have developed a simple approach based upon \nsingle-dose methodology suitable for application in the field. \nSix normal men in whom urea kinetics had been measured with a prime and \nintermittent oral doses of l5Nl5N-urea whilst taking 70 g protein\/d (Danielsen & \nJackson, 1992), repeated the study. A single dose of 15N1jN-urea, 100 mg, was taken in \nthe morning and all urine was collected for the next 48 h. The amount of \"N15N-urea in \nurine was measured and used to calculate the rate of urea production and salvaging. The \nsame method was used in six women to measure urea kinetics whilst they were on their \nhabitual intake of protein on sixteen separate occasions. \nmg N\/kg per d Production Excretion \nIntake Production Excretion Salvage Intake Production \n% ~ ?o \nMen \nInter dose 165 199 128 71 121 65 \nSD 20 18 20 \nSD 37 37 18 \nSingle dose 165 186 136 40 113 79 \nWomen \nSingle dose 215 238 147 92 126 70 \nSD 65 67 36 46 23 13 \nThese data demonstrate that the single-dose method for measuring urea kinetics gives \nsimilar results to those obtained with the prime and intermittent doses under controlled \nconditions in men. When the single-dose method is used to derive urea kinetics in women \ntaking their habitual diet under free-living circumstances, the relative pattern of changes \nis similar to that found under controlled conditions. We conclude that the single-dose \nmethod can be used for measuring urea kinetics non-invasively in free-living individuals. \nDanielsen, M. & Jackson, A .  A.  (1992).

By M. \nDANIELSEN and A. A. JACKSON, Department of Human Nutrition, University of \nSouthampton, Bassett Crescent East, Southampton SO9 3TU \nWe have shown that normal adults can maintain nitrogen balance on a diet containing 35 \ng proteidd through the enhanced salvaging of urea-N in the lower bowel (Langran et al. \n1990). In the present study the response to an intake of 30 g proteidd has been \nmeasured. \nSix healthy young men were studied on two occasions while receiving a mixed diet \nwhich provided about 150 kJ\/kg per d and either 70 or 30 g proteidd. The diets were \ngiven for 5 d and during the last 24 h urea kinetics were measured using a prime and oral \nintermittent doses of 15N,lSN-urea (Jackson et al. 1984). On 70 g proteidd urinary urea \nwas 8-46 (sD 2.2) mg N\/d on the first day and 7.89 (SD 0.82) mg N\/d on the final day of \nthe study, compared with 9.88 (SD 2.8) and 4-47 (SD 0.81) mg N\/d respectively on 30 g \nproteidd. On 30 g proteidd the subjects had stable weight, but were not in N balance \nduring the measurement of urea kinetics. \nmg Nlkg per d \nProduction Excretion Salvaged Production Excretion \nIntake Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD Intake Production \n_____ Yo % \nStudy 1 165 190 20 128 18 71 20 121 65 \nStudy 2 68 123 30 67 8 56 24 181 56 \nANOVA, P <0.001 <0.001 NS <0.01 NS \nNS, not significant \nThere was a statistically-significant decrease in the rate of urea production and \nexcretion on 30 g proteidd, with little change in the salvage of urea-N between the two \ndiets. Relative to the dietary intake, urea production was enhanced on the 30 g proteidd \ndiet, but not to the same extent as had been seen on 35 g proteidd. \nThese data show that whereas on 35 g proteidd N balance can be maintained by the \nenhanced salvaging of urea-N, when the intake is reduced to 30 g\/d the system is no \nlonger able to accommodate to maintain N balance. On 35 g proteidd the urea-N \nsalvaged was 132 mg N\/kg per d with 66 mg N\/kg per d going to excretion (Langran et al. \n1990). On 30 g proteidd the urea salvaging was reduced to almost one-third with urinary \nexcretion being similar. \nWe conclude that the salvaging of urea-N is critical to the mechanism whereby the \nbody accommodates to a low protein intake, and this system fails at an intake of 30 g \nprotein\/d. The fact that N balance on 35 g protein\/d requires the effective salvaging of \nurea-N raises questions of fundamental importance about our perceptions of minimal \nrequirements for protein in man. \nJackson, A.

By G. GROVE and A. A. JACKSON, Department of Human Nutrition, \nUniversity of Southampton, Bassett Crescent East, Southampton SO9 3TU \nAs few metabolic studies are carried out in women, frequently the results obtained in \nmen are extrapolated uncritically to apply to women. From the studies which have been \ncarried out it is clear that during the reproductive years there are important metabolic \nchanges associated with the normal hormonal cycle. Changes in energy expenditure and \nbalance (Bisdee et al. 1988) can be associated with changes in overall nitrogen status \n(Calloway & Kurzur, 1982). We were interested to know whether it was possible to \ndefine changes in protein turnover at different stages of the cycle. In a preliminary study \nthe results had suggested that, around the time of ovulation, protein turnover might be \nincreased in association with increased circulating levels of progesterone, oestradiol, \nluteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, relative to earlier in the cycle. \nHere we report the preliminary results of measurements of protein turnover in a group of \nfive women carried out 7 and 14 d after the onset of menstruation. \nFive healthy women, aged 21-27 years, who were not taking an oral contraceptive pill, \nwere studied on two occasions 3-5 weeks apart. An assessment of each individual\u2019s \nhabitual intake was made from a diet history. For the duration of the study the subjects \nwere provided with their habitual intake of energy and about 1-2 g proteidkg per d as \nsandwiches at 3 h intervals from 06.00 h. Protein turnover was measured by the \nsingle-dose-end-product method using 15N-glycine (Fern et aZ. 1984). The bladder was \nemptied at 09.00 h and a single dose of I5N-glycine (200 mg) was taken orally. Urine was \ncollected for 9 h. The enrichment in urinary ammonia was measured by mass spec- \ntrometry. Differences were sought using the paired t test. \nNitrogen flux Protein synthesis Protein degradation \n(rng N\/kg per 9 h) (rng Nlkg per 9 h) (mg Nlkg per 9 h) \nMean cv% Mean cv% Mean cv% \n.- \nDay 7 245 9 185 15 137 17 \nDay 14 317 25 237 35 210 38 \nP value 0.138 0.097 0.104 \nFor all measurements there may be greater variability in the results at day 14 than at \nday 7. There was a trend towards increased values for flux, synthesis and degradation at \nday 14 compared with day 7, but with relatively large interindividual variation this failed \nto reach conventional statistical significance. \nFor the second measurement at day 14, no attempt was made to standardize the timing \nof the study to coincide with ovulation, and so different subjects might have been at \nslightly different stages of the cycle. This could account for the wider interindividual \nvariation at this time. The data do show that there is wider intra-individual variation in \nmeasures of protein turnover in women in relation to the timing of the menstrual cycle \nthan has been found for repeated studies in men. Clearly, therefore, it is not satisfactory \nsimply to extrapolate findings in men to women. There is the need to define with much \ngreater care the metabolic and nutritional status of women throughout the menstrual \ncycle. \nBisdee, J. T., James, W. P. T. & Shaw, M. A. (1988).

By G. V. KRIEL and M. A. LOMAX, \nDepartment of Biochemistry and Physiology and M. J. BRYANT, Department of \nAgriculture, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading RG6 2AJ \nIt has been proposed that plasma concentrations of IGF-1 mediate the growth responses \nto diet (Pell & Bates, 1990). This experiment was performed to establish whether \nmanipulation of the efficiency of dietary nitrogen retention by feeding growing sheep \ndiets differing in fibre content and energy source (MacRea et al. 1985), would also alter \nplasma IGF-1 levels and their response to growth hormone administration. \nThirty-two female crossbred lambs (Suffolk cross Mule, average body-weight 26.4 (SD \n2.1) kg) were allocated to four dietary groups with the following composition (YO natural \nbasis) and metabolizable energy intakes: diet 1, 80% hay and 20% barley-based \nconcentrate (5.96 MJ\/d): diet 2, 70% hay and 30% barley-based concentrate (9.64 \nMJ\/d); diet 3, 95% barley-based concentrate and 5% hay (9-40 MJId); diet 4, 95% \nmolassed sugarbeet-based concentrate and 5% hay (10.27 MJ\/d). Diets 2, 3 and 4 were \nfed at a similar N intake (17.6 g\/d). After a 3-week period of dietary adaptation blood \nsamples were taken via jugular vein catheters over a 14 h period at hourly intervals. \nAnimals were then given an intravenous injection of pituitary oGH (0.1 mg\/kg) and 11 h \nafter the GH injection sampling was resumed at hourly intervals for a further 25 h. \nPlasma was prepared for the analysis of glucose, insulin, growth hormone and IGF-1. N \nbalances were then performed on all animals. \nTreatment. . .

By L. B. LEVY and S. A. WOOTTON, Departmtwt of Human \nNutrition, Southampton University, Bassett Crescent East, Southampron SO9 3TU \nMalnutrition is often associated with disease and infection, yet the implications that this \nmay have for the functional capacity of skeletal muscle has not been studied. Endotoxin \nalone does not result in impaired rat skeletal muscle function (Levy, 1991) Consumption \nof low-protein diets, however, resulted in prolongation of twitch time in slow twitch \nmuscles, raised force-generating capacity, alterations in force-frequency relationship \nand increased fatigue susceptibility of both fast and slow twitch muscles (Levy & \nWootton, 1991). The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of endotoxin \nadministration on the contractile characteristics of rat skeletal muscle following con- \nsumption of low-protein diets. Muscles were selected to reflect the different muscle fibre \ntypes: soleus (type I), extensor digitorum longus (EDL, type IIB) and tibialis anterior \n(TA, type IINB).  \nMale Wistar rats (initial weight 97 g (SEM 1.9 g)) were fed on a 15% protein diet \n(FED) or a 03% protein diet (LP) ad lib. After 21 d animals received either Escherichia \ncoli endotoxin (0.5 mg\/kg body-weight) or sodium chloride solution 9 g\/1 intra- \nperitoneally. Skeletal muscle function was assessed 8 h later in situ under Sagatal \nanaesthesia, as previously described (Levy & Wootton, 1989). \nThe contractile characteristics of the muscles of animals in the FED + endotoxin \ngroup were not different to the FED-control animals, except a lower force-generating \ncapacity in the TA muscle (49% twitch, 77% maximal, P<O.Ol) .  This was associated \nwith a lower TA muscle weight in the FED + endotoxin animals. Twitch characteristics \nof the LP + endotoxin animals were not different for the EDL and TA, but the soleus \nmuscle exhibited a 37% and 32% faster contraction (P<0.05) and relaxation (P>0.05) \nrespectively. Maximal force-generating capacity was lower in the LP + endotoxin group, \nattaining significance for the EDL muscle (58%, P<O.05). All three muscles exhibited \ngreater fatigue, although some muscles of LP + endotoxin animals exhibited normal \nfatigue indices. No difference in the soleus and EDL force-frequency relationship was \ndiscerned, but the TA muscle exhibited a shift to the left at 20 and 50 Hz compared to \nnon-endotoxin-treated animals (P<O.O5). \nThe results suggest that endotoxin may compound the deficits in skeletal muscle \nfunction resulting from the consumption of low-protein diets.

ANT FANG^, lHurnan Nutrition Unit, Rowett \nResearch Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen AB2 9SB and 2Department of Biomedical \nPhysics, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB9 2 2 0  \nThis study assessed the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting the \nchanges in area and distribution of adipose tissue in obese women after a period of \nsustained weight loss. Estimates of adipose tissue area in nine transaxial planes were \nmade in eight healthy obese women by MRI proton imaging before and on completion of \na 3.35 MJ (800 kcal)\/d residential weight-reducing regime lasting 3 weeks. The women \nwere aged 30-45 years with a mean starting weight of 87.73 (range 78-45-94.45) kg, and \nmean body mass index 31.9 (range 29.2-35.2) kg\/m2. Weight loss was on average 4.48 \n(range 3.90-4.80) kg . \nNine images were taken at positions distributed between the sternal notch and the mid \ncalf. The sites of these images were first determined in each subject from anatomical \nreference points. The MRI proton imager operated at 3.4 MHz, using pulse sequences \nwhich produce an inverse recovery image giving strong contrast between adipose tissue \nand other tissues (Foster et al. 1984). Four repeated measurements of adipose tissue area \nin one subject had coefficients of variation ranging from 2.2% to 9.6% at these sites. \nThe sum of the adipose tissue area (ATA) at the nine sites at the beginning of the \nregime correlated significantly with total fat mass (kg) as estimated from densitometry (r \n0.74, P<0.05). The Table shows the initial percentage of ATA (% ATA) at each site, \nand ATA as a percentage of total area lost (YO TAL) at each site. Sixty-two per cent of \nthe adipose tissue area measured was distributed between four sections. These four \nsections also accounted for 67% TAL from these sites. There was a significant \nrelationship between ATA and TAL ( r  0.86, P<O*Ol). The variability in TAL at each \nsite reflects not only differences in the site of loss between subjects, but also differences \nin the positioning of soft tissue relative to anatomical landmarks. The usefulness of MRI \nfor detecting changes in adipose tissue at different sites therefore depends on careful \nconsideration of the sites imaged. \nSection. . . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n% ATA 9.1 12.3 11.1 14.6 19.3 15.9 10.0 4.3 3.3 \nSD 1.1 2.1 1.8 1.6 0.9 1.1 2.0 1.4 0.7 \nYo TAL 8.4 18.8 3.0 20.1 19.1 23.8 6.5 -1.7 2.0 \nSD 8.0 10.8 20.1 9.8 14.1 17.3 11.6 11.7 3.4 \nFoster, M.

By MARY \nCURSITER, Department of Dietetics and Nutrition and M. HOLMES, Department of \nManageinent and Social Sciences, Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh EH12 8TS \nand SHEILA JENNETT, Institute of Physiology, University of Glasgow, Glasgow \nG12 8QQ \nWeight gain after cessation of smoking has been attributed to a combination of changes \nin energy intake and energy expenditure (EE). Smoking increases 24 h EE (Hofstetter \net al. 1986); Perkins et al. (1989) showed that nicotine has a thermogenic effect on E E  \nduring light exercise. The aim of the present study is to investigate energy balance and \nbody-weight in women smokers, before and after cessation of smoking. \nThis preliminary report presents data on EE and body-weight in forty subjects: \ntwenty-seven successful ex-smokers (mean (SD) age 34.5 (6.0) years and body mass index \n22.6 (2.2)) and fifteen who relapsed (35.9 (6.4) years and 22.0 (2.4)). Subjects were \nassessed as smokers (baseline) and 1 month after an agreed cessation date (return). \nSmoking status was monitored at each visit by measuring end-expired carbon monoxide. \nResting metabolic rate (RMR) and EE during light exercise (EEX) were measured by \nopen-circuit indirect calorimetry using a Douglas bag. The exercise test used a cycle \nergometer, set at a level (determined at a practice visit) to produce light exercise \n(approximately 50% of maximum heart rate, EE 15-20 kJ\/min) for each subject. \nExercise (5 min warm-up, 6 min measurement) was repeated after a 15 min break, during \nwhich subjects either smoked (baseline) or rested (return). The thermogenic effect of \nsmoking on EEX was calculated by subtracting the change in EEX after rest from the \nchange in EEX after smoking. Data were analysed by t tests; complete data were not \nobtained for all subjects. \nSuccess group Relapsed group \nBaseline Return Baseline Return \nn Mean SD Mean SD n Mean SD Mean SD \n~~~ \nWeight (kg) 27 62.0 5.8 64.1** 6.3 15 61.7 7.0 62.4 7.1 \nRMR (kJ\/kg per d) 25 94.6 15.3 91.7 11.8 13 94.7 8.4 95.0 8.5 \nEEX (kJ\/mm) 23 15.3 2.5 15.0 2.5 15 16.2 2.7 16.3 2.8 \nEEX (kJlkgper h) 23 14.9 2.5 14.1* 2.5 15 15.8 2.2 15.8 2.6 \nRMR (kJld) 25 5835 723 5876 755 13 5762 650 5853 765 \n*P<0.05, **P<O.OOl.

A \nthermogenic effect was not found: there was no significant difference between the \npre-smoking EEX (15.5 (2.4) kJ\/kg per h) and the net post-smoking EEX (15.8 (2.5) \nkJ\/kg per h). \nThese results show that stopping smoking leads to a reduction in the energy cost of \nlight exercise; this response, together with other minor decreases in EE, may contribute \nto weight gain after cessation of smoking. \nThis work was supported by the Scottish Health Education Group. \nHofstetter, A., Schultz, Y..

By PAUL \nHAGGARTY, GERALDINE MCNEILL, BRIAN A. MCGAW, SUSANNAH L. \nCHRISTIE, DEBORAH C. MORRISON, ERIC MILNE and GARY DUNCAN, Rowett \nResearch Institute, Greenburn Road, Bucksburn, Aberdeen AB2 9SB \nDivers often undergo substantial weight loss during saturation diving with the seventy of \nthe weight loss generally being proportional to the depth achieved. At least part of this \nweight loss is the result of negative water balance but it has been suggested that \nsaturation diving could also impose additional energetic stresses which may not be met \nby food intake (Webb, 1976). With the advent of the heavy water technique (Lifson & \nMcClintock, 1966) it has become possible to quantify the energy expenditure of subjects \nwithout restriction, and in hostile environments remote from calorimetric equipment. \nThe results of a heavy water study carried out during a 450 m dive are presented here. \nA 31 d onshore 450 m simulated dive was undertaken by six divers at the National \nHyperbaric Centre in Aberdeen. During the 10 d bottom phase the energy intake of the \ndivers was assessed by monitoring the food entering and leaving the chamber airlock and \nC02 production was determined by analysing the isotopic composition of daily urine \nsamples after administration of triply-labelled water (TLW) (Haggarty et al. 1988). \nEnergy expenditure was calculated using respiratory quotients derived from food \nquotients and the change in body energy. During this time the divers undertook a \npipeline repair requiring significant physical work and manual dexterity. \nThe five divers studied all lost weight during the bottom phase; a mean of 266 (SEM 36) \ng\/d, representing a loss of 3.5% of normal body-weight over the 10 d active period of the \ndive. Over this same period the mean energy intake was 9.69 (SEM 0.33) MJ\/d and \nenergy expenditure was 12.55 (SEM 0.98) MJ\/d. The resulting energy deficit of 2.70 MJ\/d \ncould account for around a third of the measured weight loss. The remaining two-thirds \nof the weight loss was assumed to be water. This conclusion was supported by \nhaematocrit values which indicated that the divers became dehydrated as the dive \nprogressed. \nUsing the FAO\/WHO\/UNU (1985) prediction equations it can be calculated from the \nbody-weight of these divers that their mean basal metabolic rate (BMR) would be 7-39 \nMJ\/d. On the basis of the FAO\/WHO\/UNU classifications the energy expenditure of the \ndivers (1.68 x BMR) was not excessive, falling below the moderate activity classifi- \ncation, whereas the intake (1.33 x BMR) would not be sufficient to support even light \nactivity on the surface. Thus, there is indeed an energy imbalance during deep saturation \ndiving and this can explain some of the weight loss found in divers. However, the \nmeasured expenditure could easily be sustained on the surface therefore it must be \nconciuded that the energy imbalance is due to a fall in food intake under hyperbaric \nconditions. Since the divers had access to a wide variety of palatable foods the reduced \nintake must have been due to loss of appetite. \nFAO\/WHO\/UNU (1985). Technical Report Series no. 724.

MOODY, School of Food and Consumer Studies, The Robert \nGordon's Institute of Technology, Queen's Road, Aberdeen AB9 2PG \nFeeding pattern describes the energy intake over a 24 h day as judged by the time of \nconsumption and size of all feeding occasions. Increased feeding frequency and a shift in \ndaily energy intake towards the beginning of the waking day have been associated with \nlower body-weights compared to controls (Adams & Morgan, 1981). Feeding pattern is \nthought to affect body-weight by altering the total daily thermic effect of food (TEF) \n(Fabry, 1969). \nFeeding pattern and body mass index (BMI) were studied in 231 free-living humans, \nseparated for analysis into five age-groups. Total daily energy intake (TDI) was assessed \nusing 7-d weighed dietary intakes. TDI was divided into six feeding periods; breakfast, \nmid-morning snacks, lunch, afternoon snacks, dinner and evening snacks (Summerbell & \nMoody, 1992). The variance between the mean energy intakes over the six consecutive \nfeeding periods, as a per cent of TDI, was used as an assessment of feeding pattern and \ncalled the Feeding Pattern Index (FPI). \nTDI IkJ) \nn Males Females BMI \n- Regression \nGroup Male Female Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD slope? \nAdolescent 12 21 10 802a 2041 7174 1785 21.0' 3.4 0.3105* \nStudent 0 11 - - 7543 1012 20.6 1.7 0.1141 \nYoungadult 29 30 10 332\" 2285 8618\" 2537 22.4 2.1 4.0970 \nElderly 24 64 8652h 1817 6917d 1420 23.6 5.9 -0.0245 \nMiddle-aged 6 34 9929 2247 6829b 1512 25.1\" 4.3 0.1191 \n7 Regression coefficient (slope) showing the change in BMI associated with a unit increase in FPI; \"P<0.05. \nDifferences between age groups were assessed using ANOVA and Scheffe's multiple comparison test. and \nA positive linear relationship was found between FPI and BMI in the adolescent \ngroup, i.e. a more even distribution of energy intake over a day (a snacking pattern) was \nassociated with lower BMI. Also, the amount of energy consumed at breakfast was \ninversely related to BMI (P<0.05) in the adolescent group. Feeding pattern was not \nrelated to BMI within the other four age groups. \nOverall, these results show no significant relationship between feeding pattern and \nBMI in the population as a whole. The lack of a clear or consistent definition of a feeding \noccasion in earlier studies makes it difficult to draw relevant comparisons. \nAlthough weak, the relationship between feeding pattern and body-weight in the \nadolescent group did not support the work of Fabry (1969), unlike those from the other \nage-groups. Two possible explanations for this result are suggested. Firstly, it has been \nshown that TEF decreases with age (Golay et al. 1983); secondly, the relative timing of \nphysical activity in relation to food intake has been shown to affect TEF (Miller et al. \n1967) and it is conceivable that the adolescent group expended greater levels of energy \nafter feeding occasions as compared with the other age-groups. \nare represented by the superscript letters a 4  where: a v .  b = Pt0.05: a v.  c = P<0.01: a v .  d = P<0.001. \nAdams, C.

The population is consuming relatively more food and drink \nduring the latter part of the day and adolescents are placing less emphasis for energy \nintake on the traditional meal. These changes are strongly related to social changes in the \nBritish society. \nTypical snack food such as chocolate and sweet confectionery, fizzy drinks and \nsquashes contributed to the relaiively high proportion of energy intake at mid-morning \nand afternoon in the adolescent group, whereas alcohol accounted for the relatively high \nproportion of energy intake during the evening in the student group. \nThe degree of snacking (Summerbell & Moody, 1992) was related to sugar consump- \ntion (P<0.05) due to the fact that food commodities consumed as snacks were relatively \nhigher in sugar (P<O.OOl)  than those commodities consumed as meals. These results add \nto the concern (BNF, 1987) about high sugar intakes, particularly between meals, \nleading to dental decay, especially in adolescents. \nBNF (1985). Eating in the early 1980s.

GOLDBERG and A. M. PRENTICE, Dunn Clinical Nutrition \nCentre, 100 Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 l Q L  \nExperiments in mice have demonstrated that energy intake is negatively correlated with \ncarbohydrate (CHO) balance on the preceding day (Flatt, 1987). suggesting that a drive \nto maintain CHO balance is a major factor regulating energy balance. \nThis hypothesis was tested by whole-body calorimetry of nine men (body-weight 72 \n(SD 6) kg, body mass index 23 (SD 6) kg\/m2) studied twice on the following protocol (% \nfat:CHO:protein by energy): Day 1, maintenance (40:47:13); Day 2, manipulation \n(carbohydrate depletion (85:3: 12) or control (40:47: 13) diets fed to an identical, slightly \npositive energy balance); Day 3, outcome. Nutrient composition was calculated using the \nvalues from Paul & Southgate (1978). Three-hourly urine samples were analysed for \nnitrogen (Kjeldahl) to determine protein oxidation rates. Fat and CHO oxidation rates \nwere calculated from non-protein gaseous exchange, using the coefficients of Elia & \nLivesey (1988). Carbohydrate fluxes on the manipulation day were: depletion intake 23 \ng, net oxidation 70 g, balance -47 g; control intake 309 g, net oxidation 208 g, balance \n101 g. Thus, hepatic glycogen was severely depleted on the depletion diet (evidenced by \nlow net CHO oxidation and negative balance) and was replete on the control diet. On \nthe outcome day subjects had ad lib. access to a normal diet (40:47:13) and were \nencouraged to eat to satisfaction. Outcome variables are summarized in the Table. \nDepletion Control \nEnergy Protein Fat CHO Energy Protein Fat CHO \n(kJ) (8) (g) (d (kJ) (g) (g) (g) \nIntake 12 729 96 134 384 12 717 97 134 381 \nSD 224 17 24 68 20 1 15 21 62 \nOxidation 9193 87 120 174 9212 95 89 256 \nSD 797 20 11 41 753 35 12 39 \nBalance 3536 9 14 210 3505 2 46 125 \nSD 2140 22 26 66 2045 39 30 46 \nWe interpret the marked positive energy balance as a failure to down-regulate habitual \nintake to match the low activity in the calorimeter.

MCCRACKEN',~, The Queen's University of \nBelfast, Newforge Lane, Belfast BT9 5PX and Food and Agricultural Chemistry \nDepartment, Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland \nIt has been established that energy intake may be limiting lean growth rate in pigs of high \ngenetic potential (Rao & McCracken, 1991). The role of dietary fat in promoting energy \nintake and growth is controversial (Cole & Chadd, 1989). This may be partly due to \nvariability of the quality of fat sources used. A blended fat designed to be close to the \ncomposition of pig adipose tissue was prepared and the apparent digestible energy \ncontent was found to be 34.1 MJ\/kg. This was incorporated into a wheat-barley-fish- \nsoya-bean diet to produce four diets (1-4 respectively), containing 0, 50, 100, 150 of \nsupplemental fat\/kg feed. Four replicates of five littermate pigs were obtained from \npedigree breeders at around 25 kg. They were allocated within litters to one of the four \ndiets or to a fifth treatment offering free choice of diets 1 and 4. All diets were offered \nad lib. from 33-90 kg. \nFeed weighbacks were determined daily and pigs were weighed twice a week to find \nlive weight gain (LWG). The digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) \ncontents of the diets were measured by 6 d balance at around 60 kg live weight. \nDiet 1 2 3 4 5 SEM \nME intake (MJ\/d) 30.4 30.5 30.5 30.8 31.6 0.98 \nLWG(kg\/d) 1.01 1.04 1.05 1.01 1.01 0.053 \nME:LWG 30-1 29.5 29.4 30.5 31.5 0.92 \nThe DE contents were 15-7, 16.9, 17.7 and 19.1 MJ\/kg dry matter for diets 1-4 \nrespectively. There were no significant effects of dietary treatment on ME intake, daily \ngain or conversion of ME to gain. There were large differences between litters in ME \nintake (MJ\/d) (27-2, 31.3, 32.7 and 31-9 (SEM 0.88); P=0.04) and in feed efficiency \n(MJ\/kg gain) (28.9, 32-6,30-8 and 28.5 (SEM 0.82); P=0-014). There were also marked \ndifferences in the proportion of energy from the basal diet selected by the four pigs given \na choice (0.23, 0.50, 0.58, 0.67). \nThe results confirm the report of Cole & Chadd (1989) that boars regulate energy \nintake very closely over a wide range of energy density, and suggest that regulation of \nenergy intake is also maintained when a choice of energy density is offered despite \ndifferences in the level of dietary fat selected by individual pigs. \nCole, D.

M. FORBES, Department of Animal Physiology \nand Nutrition, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT \nResults of studies on the effect of adding fat to the diet on growth and carcass \ncomposition of chickens are conflicting. Griffiths et al. (1977) observed no differences in \nthe composition of the carcass when various levels of fat were fed, while Donaldson \n(1985) indicated that body fat was increased by feeding a fat-rich diet. Adding maize oil \nto the diet will not only increase its energy content, but may also decrease food intake to \nmaintain energy intake. \nTo study further the effect of adding maize oil to the diet on voluntary food intake and \nbody fatness in broiler chickens, twenty-four male broiler chickens were housed \nindividually at 4 weeks of age.

By H. R. KUTLU and J. M. FORBES, Department of \nAnimal Physiology and Nutrition, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT \nHeat stress caused by a high ambient temperature leads to increased mortality, reduced \nfeed intake and growth rate in broilers. Ascorbic acid (AA) can alleviate the effect of \nheat stress on broiler performance, but the success is variable. Our preliminary results \nshowed that dietary supplemental AA improved body growth and feed intake under heat \nstress. The objective of this study was to determine whether chicks, when receiving both \nAA-supplemented diet and normal diet simultaneously, would prefer the supplemented \none when each feed was of a different colour. Unsupplemented red (R-), 0.2 g\/kg \nAA-supplemented red (R+), unsupplemented green (G-) and 0.2 g\/kg AA- \nsupplemented green (G+) coloured standard starter diets were prepared. Sixty-four, \n1-week-old female broiler chicks were divided up into eight groups. Following an 8 d \ntraining period, the chicks were given a choice between either G- and R- or G+ and R- \nor G- and R+ or G+ and R+ for 14 d under either heated (14 h 26\": 10 h 38\") or \nnon-heated (constant 26\") conditions. \nFeed combinations \nG- and R- G+ and R- G- and R+ G+ and R+ SED \nFeed intake (g\/bird) Heated 816 + 438 785 + 543 432 + 877 678 + 752 - \nover testing period (65%) (35%) (60%) (40%) (33%) (67%) (47%) (53%) \nNon-heated 656 + 846 356 + 995 942 + 593 758 + 612 - \n(44%) (56%) (26%) (74%) (61%) (39%) (55%) (45%) \nBody-wt (g\/bird) Heated 872d 966b.c.d Y12C.d 984\"4 \nat 29 d of age Non-heated 1059a,h 980a-d 1080\" 1009a.b 16.4 \nSED, standard error of the difference between means. \na-d Means with different superscript letters are significantly different: P<0.05. \nHeating reduced feed intake and body growth.

Although the \ndifferences between intakes of AA-supplemented diets and unsupplemented diets were \nnot statistically significant (P>0.05), the results tended to support the proposition that \nthe birds could associate AA supplementation and colour and they preferred AA- \nsupplemented diet to unsupplemented diet under high environmental temperature. \n56A ABSTRACTS OF C O M M U N I C A T I O N S  1992 \nThe effect of force-feeding various levels of protein on diet selection and growth of broiler \nchickens.

The composition of recently-digested food is a factor \nin determining short-term regulation (Shariatmadari & Forbes, 1990b). \nIn order to assess the ability of broilers to control their protein intake over a longer \nperiod of time, fow groups of ten male broiler chickens, 3 weeks of age, were force-fed \n40 g per d of isocaloric diets with protein (CP, nitrogen 6-25) contents of 60, 135, 215 or \n295 ( T l ,  T2, T3 and T4 respectively) g CP\/kg fresh food for 10 d with ad lib. access to a \nchoice of feeds with b0 (LP) and 295 (HP) g CP\/kg.

As a result of higher \ntotal protein intake, carcass weight and carcass protein content were increased at the end \nof a 10 d force-feeding period. During the post-treatment period feed intake was higher \nin T3 and T4 birds while protein intake was unaffected. This lower protein:energy ratio \nresulted in reduced carcass protein deposition and showed that these birds had not \nreadjusted their protein intake after the end of force-feeding with high protein feeds. \nShariatmadari.

BOOTH, School of Psychology, \nUniversity of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham B1.5 2TT and JAN HAMILTON, \nSchool of Home Economics, Texas Technological University \nToughness of connective tissue and particle size in a meat soup were predicted to slow \npassage from the stomach and hence to prolong satiety as measured by subsequent food \nconsumption. \nSubjects were twelve undergraduate students in normal health who were not at the \ntime restricting their diet in any way. Each subject completed test sessions with pre-loads \nof two meat species (beef and chicken) and two sizes of meat particles (2 and 4 mm) in a \nmeat-flavoured clear soup base: for men, 200 g meat, 20 g pasta, 285 ml stock; for \nwomen, 140 g meat, 14 g pasta, 200 ml stock. \nThese were served at the subject\u2019s normal lunch time on days when the dietary record \nshowed normal consumption from the previous evening. In the first four sessions subjects \nhad free access to a selection of pre-packed and weighed foods as a test meal given 30 \nmin after each pre-load; a further four sessions presented the test meal 3 h later. \nTable 1.

Thus what \nhas been described as a protein effect could be a meat effect arising from differences in \nconnective tissue. The satiating effects of different foods cannot be understood without \nmanipulating macronutrient contents and other properties of the food independently in \nways that distinguish between mechanisms that could be operative during the test for \nsatiety. \n58A ABSTRACTS O F  COMMUNICATIONS 1992 \nGene expression and the metabolic role of zinc. By J. K. CHESTERS, R. BOYNE and \nBoth in animals and in cell cultures, low availability of zinc restricts growth and \nspecifically inhibits DNA synthesis. In 3T3 cells, the timing of the requirement for Zn \ncoincided with the period of induction of the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis \n(Chesters et al. 1989) and lack of Zn inhibited the corresponding increase in thymidine \nkinase (EC 2.7.1.21, TK) activity. The latter was associated with a reduced concen- \ntration of TK mRNA (Chesters et al. 1990) consistent with the hypothesis that Zn is \nnecessary for certain changes in gene expression (Chesters, 1978). \nSince this hypothesis was largely based on effects of Zn deficiency on replicating cells, \nthe generality of this requirement has now been investigated by examining the impact of \nlow Zn availability induced by addition of a chelator, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid \n(DTPA, 600 pM), on the differentiation of myoblasts in culture. During differentiation, \nthe cells lose the ability to produce DNA, leave the replication cycle and begin to \nsynthesize muscle-specific proteins such as creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2, CK). Although \ninhibition of DNA synthesis by lack of Zn might have been expected to encourage \ndifferentiation, the latter was actually impaired and CK activity was reduced by DTPA \nand these effects were specifically reversed by Zn (400 pM). Similar additions of calcium, \ncobalt and copper did not alter the inhibition by DTPA while iron, manganese and nickel \nproduced only partial reactivations probably associated with displacement of endogen- \nous Zn from the chelator. \nLINDA PETRIE, Rowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen AB2  9SB \nCreatine kinase Creatine kinase \nactivity mRNA \nI \nTreatment (IUlmg protein) CWIXS\" CWS6; \nControl 2.41 1.62 1.40 \nDTPA alone (-Zn) 0.27 0.09 0.15 \nDTPA+Zn (+Zn) 2.33 1.13 1.20 \nDTP A + Fe 0.73 \nDTPA+Mn 1.33 \nDTPA+Ni 0.81 \n* 1% ribosomal protein RNA. \nt S6 ribosomal protein MRNA. \nFurther investigations using Northern hybridization to quantify specific RNAs \nrevealed that, as with thymidine kinase, the reduction in creatine kiriase activity was \naccompanied by a corresponding decrease in the concentration of CK mRNA. This did \nnot result from a generalized inhibition of mRNA synthesis since the decrease was \nequally apparent whether CK mRNA concentrations were expressed per unit of 18s \nribosomal RNA or relative to the concentration of the constitutively expressed mRNA \nfor ribosomal protein S6. It appears that adequate Zn is a prerequisite for induction of \nnormal concentrations of mRNA not only for certain enzymes involved in DNA \nsynthesis but also for others induced in its absence. \nChesters, J.

M. RHODES, A. GREEN and M. J. JACKSON, Department of \nMedicine, University of Liverpool, PO Box 147, Liverpool L69 3BX \nStudies in experimental animals have indicated that analysis of the kinetics of isotopic \nzinc turnover in plasma may be of use in the assessment of body Zn status and provide \ninformation on the size and kinetics of a rapidly-exchangeable, intracellular \u2018pool\u2019 of Zn \nprimarily located within the liver (Lowe et al. 1991). Previous data on the immediate fate \nof injected radioactive Zn in man have indicated a similar pattern of distribution of the \nisotope to that seen in experimental animals (Wastney et al. 1986) and we have therefore \nattempted to examine plasma Zn turnover in normal human subjects using enriched \nstable 70Zn. \nSix normal subjects (four male, two female, aged 25-38 years) were given a bolus \nintravenous injection of 0.5 mg 98%-enriched 70Zn as zinc chloride in isotonic saline (9 g \nsodium chloride\/l). Blood samples were removed at frequent intervals for periods of up \nto 2 h, the plasma was separated and analysed for 70Zn content by inductively-coupled \nplasma-mass spectrometry following extraction of the Zn by ion-exchange chroma- \ntography. The decay curves of 70Zn enrichment were analysed using the techniques \npreviously used to study 65Zn kinetics in rat plasma (Lowe et al. 1991), as originally \ndescribed by Shipley & Clarke (1972). \nOver the time course of the study (120 min) plasma 70Zn enrichment closely followed \ntwo compartment kinetics and was analysed appropriately to derive the sizes of the two \nexchangeable pools (Q, and ah), their fractional turnover rates and the fluxes between \nthese pools. It was assumed that on injection the 70Zn rapidly equilibrated with all of the \nZn in plasma. The initial exchangeable pool was calculated to have a size of 0-047 (SEM \n0.006) mg\/kg body-weight, which was approximately one-quarter that of the second pool \n(QI,: 0.235 (SEM 0.061)). The initial pool was also found to have a very rapid turnover \n(fractional turnover rate: mean (SEM) 0.099 (0.004)\/min) compared to that of Qb (0.019 \nResults therefore indicate that similar plasma Zn kinetics occur in man to those \npreviously described in the rat (Lowe et al. 1991) and the pig (Chesters & Will, 1981). \nMathematical analysis of these decay data appears to provide access to information on \nthe sizes and turnover of Zn pools in man which is likely to be of relevance in various \nsituations, such as the assessment of Zn status and the determination of optimal \nrequirement of dietary Zn. \n(0.002)). \nThe authors would like to thank the Wellcome Trust for financial support. \nChesters.

By G. BREVES, H .  KAEPPNER and B. SCHROEDER, Department of \nVeterinary Physiology, University of Giessen, D 6300 Giessen. Germany \nIt is well documented that the upper small intestine is the major site for net absorption of \ninorganic phosphate (PI) in simple-stomached animals as well as in ruminants (Harrison \n& Harrison, 1961; Pfeffer et al. 1970). Whereas the localization, the mechanisms \ninvolved and their regulation have been intensively studied in simple-stomached species, \nlittle is known about Pi transport characteristics in ruminants. \nIt was the aim of the present study to measure the unidirectional transepithelial PI \nfluxes in the proximal duodenum and mid-jejunum of goats and sheep. Stripped \nepithelial tissues from the duodenum and the jejunum were mounted between the two \nhalves of Ussing-type chambers (surface area 1 cm2). The tissues were incubated in the \npresence of 0.01 mM-indomethacin in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4; 38\") \ncontaining 3.0 mM-phosphate and 10 mM-glUCOSe (serosal) or 10 mM-mannitol \n(mucosal). Indomethacin was added to minimize epithelial prostaglandin effects. For \nmeasurement of unidirectional PI fluxes corresponding tissues were paired. In paired \ntissues the transepithelial conductance (Gt) differed by less than 25%, and 6-8 FCi \ncarrier-free 32P-orthophosphate were added either to the mucosal or to the serosal side \nof the tissue. Flux measurements were initiated 20 min after the addition of 32P and \nconsisted of at least two 15 min flux periods. The tissues were short-circuited during the \nflux measurement and chemical gradients were eliminated, thus allowing measurement \nof active PI transport. \nIn both segments of the small intestine, PI fluxes from mucosal to serosal side (Jms) \nwere significantly higher than in the opposite direction (Jsm) resulting in a significant net \nflux (Jnet). This clearly indicates the presence of a process for active PI absorption in the \nduodenum and jejunum of ruminants (Table). In both species jejunal J,,, was signifi- \ncantly higher compared with the duodenum. \nPi flux rates (nmollcm2 per h), Gr (mSlcm2) and short circuit currents I,, ('peqlcm2 per h) of \nduodenal and jejunal tissue preparations obtained from goats and sheep (means (SEM) for N \nanimals) \nJ, JS\" J\",, Gt 15, \nSpecies Tissue n Mean SEM Mean SEM Mean SEhl Mean SEM Mean SEM \nGoats Duodenum 7 82.2a 12.7 33.0\" 5.2 49.3a 9.4 14.7a 1.2 +0.35\" 0.04 \nSheep Duodenum 6 130.3a 19.1 81.4b 11.1 49.0a 9.9 29.0h 3.0 +0,3S11 0.04 \nJejunum 6 272.8b 33.8 88.3b 21.8 173.3b 47.9 27.P 2.4 -1.29b 0.57 \nJejunum 13 197.P 22.1 81.3h 14.0 116.4b 21.6 30.8' 2.8 +0.37b 0.15 \nMean values in a vertical column with different superscript letters are significantly different (P<0.05; unpaired t test). \nHarrison, H.

Calcium, magnesium, sodium or potassium \nchlorides were added to the incubation buffer of test sacs at concentrations giving the \nsame ratios to the trace metal under study as are found in normal human diets.

By J .  R. ARTHUR', \nG. J.  BECKETT~, F. NICOL~, Y. GUO' and P. TRAYHURN~, lDivision of Bio- \nchemical Sciences, Rowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen AB2 9SB and \n2University Department of Clinical Chemistry, The Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh \nEH3 9YW \nThe trace element selenium is now recognized to be essential for normal thyroid \nhormone and iodine metabolism (Arthur et al. 1990b). Recent work has shown that Se is \na key component of the type I iodothyronine deiodinase enzyme in liver (Arthur et al. \n1990a), which converts thyroxine to the biologically-active thyroid hormone, 3',3:5- \ntriiodothyronine (T3). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has a high activity of the type I1 \niodothyronine deiodinase (ID-II), and the activity is greatly increased in response to cold \nexposure (see Arthur et al. 1991). Severe Se deficiency appears to lead to an impairment \nof ID-I1 activity in BAT, and there is also an inhibition of the acute cold-induced \nstimulation of the enzyme (Arthur et al. 1991). In the present study we have examined \nthe progressive effects of Se deficiency on the stimulation by cold of ID-I1 in BAT. \nMale, weanling, Hooded Lister rats were offered either a Se-deficient (<0.005 mg \nSelkg; -Se) or a Se-supplemented (0.1 mg Selkg; +Se) diet for periods of up to 6 weeks \n(Arthur et al. 1990~). Interscapular BAT was removed from groups of twelve rats after 2, \n4 and 6 weeks; half the animals in each group were exposed to 4\" for 18 h before \nsampling, the other animals being kept at 21\". \nIncrease in ID-11 activity (fmollmin per mg protein) in BAT of rats exposed to 4\" for 18 h \nWeeks on diet +Selenium (n  6) -Selenium (n 6) \n2 2.84 2.52 \n4 1.89 0.25 \n6 2.51 0.13 \nThe basal ID-I1 activity in BAT of +Se rats declined progressively between 2-6 weeks \nafter weaning. A decline also occurred in -Se animals, and at 4 and 6 weeks the basal \nactivity was signficantly lower in the -Se than the +Se animals. Cold exposure caused an \nincrease in ID-I1 activity of 1.89-244 fmol\/min per mg protein (thirteen-thirtyfold) in \n+Se rats at each time-point of the study (see Table). The cold-induced increase in \nactivity was lower in -Se than in +Se rats at 4 and 6 weeks, and declined from 2.52 \nfmol\/min per mg protein (fifteenfold) at 2 weeks to a mere 0.13 units (fourfold) by 6 \nweeks. \nThese results confirm that Se deficiency leads to an impairment in the cold-induced \nactivation of ID-I1 in BAT. The results also show that the defect is evident by 4 weeks \nafter the introduction of the Se-deficient diet. In view of the importance of T3 to \nthermogenesis in BAT, it is likely that the response to cold will be impaired in Se \ndeficiency; this may be of particular relevance to neonatal animals born to dams with a \nvery low Se status. \nArthur, J .

By FATI RABIEE, \nJ.  MUNN and J. LUTZ, South Birmingham Health Education Department, Highgate \nStreet, Birmingham B12 OYA \nAs part of a larger study to develop programmes for preventing coronary heart disease \n(CHD), anthropometric, health knowledge, food frequency and 24 h food recall (over 2 \nd; a weekday and a weekend day) data were collected on 625 pupils aged 14-15 years. \nSchools chosen were socio-economically and ethnically diverse. Fifty-eight per cent of \npupils were Asians. Selected nutrients were compared with recommended daily intake \n(RDI) (Department of Health and Social Security, 1979). \nMean (SD) weights and heights for girls and boys were 51 ( 5 )  kg, 157 (6) cm and 61 (9) \nkg, 168 (10) cm respectively. Six per cent of the population studied were thin (<90% \nweight for height), 8% overweight (>110% weight for height), and 3% were short \n(<%yo height for age) (National Centre for Health Statistics, 1976; Bray, 1975-76). \nEleven per cent of the girls and 2% of the boys said they were currently dieting. \nMean daily energy intake was low both for girls and boys (86% and 83% of the RDI \nrespectively). Protein and ascorbic acid were more than adequate, iron was adequate in \nboys (108Y0 of RDI) and marginally adequate in girls (94% of RDI), but calcium was \ninadequate in both (87% of RDI). Fat contributed 34% of the total energy in girls and \n37% in boys. Carbohydrate provided 53% of the energy in girls and 50% m boys. Sugar \ncontributed 21% of the energy in girls and 15% in boys. Mean daily fibre intake was 16 g \nfor girls and 17 g for boys. \nThe diet is therefore higher in fat and sugary food and lower in fibre than the NACNE \nrecommendation on healthy eating (NACNE, 1983). \nAnalysis of food frequency data suggests that 74% of the pupils drink full-fat milk as \ncompared to only 22% who drink semi-skimmed and skimmed milk. Cheddar cheese is \nstill the most popular cheese (69%) and only 10% of the pupils eat lower-fat varieties. \nThirty-nine per cent of the pupils eat at least one packet of crisps and 25% have one \nhelping of chips every day. Fifty-one per cent of the pupils take fizzy drinks, Ribena and \nLucozade, and 48% have at least one helping of chocolate, sweets, biscuits and cake \nevery day. Fifty-six per cent of pupils consume white bread and 52% cornflakes or rice \ncrispies for breakfast. This pattern of dietary practice echoes the findings of Balding\u2019s \nstudy (Balding, 1987); however, in girls there is lower fat and higher carbohydrate \nconsumption than in Wenlock\u2019s survey (Wenlock et al. 1986). \nIn conclusion, two-thirds of pupils knew about the importance of healthy eating in \npreventing CHD. However, dietary practices did not reflect their knowledge. Health \nEducation programmes in schools should aim to give practical guidance 011 healthy eating \nand also to develop skills to implement knowledge. \nBalding, J. (1987). Young people in 1986.

By PENNY ALLEN and ELIZABETH DOWLER, Centre for Human \nNutrition, London  School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2 Taviton Street, \nLondon WClH OBT \nReform of the UK means-tested benefit system in 1988 was designed to target resources \nto those most in need. Concern has been expressed that the low levels of benefit, and the \nstringent access rules, mitigate against many low-income households being able to afford \na reasonably healthy diet, or even an adequate one. In 1989, a 3-month pilot study was \ncarried out during preparation of a proposal to investigate the nature of nutritional \ndeprivation in such households. The pilot study had two objectives: to assess a \nsemi-structured interview questionnaire to explore food poverty and deprivation among \nlow-income households; and to test the proposed method for contacting low-income \nhouseholds. \nThe interview questionnaire included five broad areas: household details, budgeting \npriorities, the food budget, shopping patterns, and eating patterns. Many useful \nobservations about the design and management of the interview schedule were made. \nLow-income households were contacted through the network of Citizens\u2019 Advice \nBureaux (CAB), and interviewed by a nutritionist. \nFifty householders volunteered to remain for interview after seeing their CAB officer \nduring July and August, 1989 in two London CAB, and ten householders were \ninterviewed in Homeless Families\u2019 Centres. Response rates in the CAB were poor \n(approximately 16% of clients per day, and averaging 4-2 respondentdhalf day) because \nof operational difficulties in using CAB offices. As a result, the main study was \nredesigned. \nThe average expenditure on food per week was 37% of income: 533 per household and \nf14 per person. These figures were said to be very variable, especially in the low-income \nhouseholds. Nearly 60% interviewed said they cut back on food purchases when they \nwere short of money, although they mostly cut out other items first. Nearly 40% said \nthey sometimes ran out of money for food; five households said they did so fortnightly or \nmore often. Most of the latter were \u2018unemployed childless\u2019 or single parents on Social \nSecurity benefits. Homeless families and basic State pensioners also had problems buying \nthe quantity and quality of food they wanted. The main items respondents wanted to eat \nmore often were fresh meat, fresh fruit and fresh vegetables. These were also the items \nmost regularly omitted when money was tight (see Figure). \nCa kes\/biscuits Bread 7 \nFrui \n9 \nSoft drinkskoffee \n3 \nMeat 5 Pasta Milk \n21 2 2  \nLess More \nFoods bought less or more when cutting back. \n66A AB S TR A CTS 0 F C 0 M hl U N I CAT I 0  N S 1992 \nAre practice nurses an effective means of delivering dietary advice as part of health \npromotion in primary health care? By ALISON KYLE, Department of Public Health \nMedicine, Somerset Health Authority, Taunton, Somerset TA2 7PQ \nThe introduction of the new GP contract in April 1990 has given the primary health care \nteam (PHCT) greater incentive to carry out health promotion activities. One area of \nhealth promotion which many practice nurses (PN) have undertaken is giving dietary \nadvice to patients both in a preventative role and in disease management. \nThe present study looks at nutrition training of PN within Somerset Family Health \nServices Authority (FHSA). The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the \ndietary training provided and the quality of information being imparted to clients in \nterms of skills at imparting simple healthy-eating messages accurately and that are easily \nunderstood; giving different dietary advice e.g. weight-reducing or simple diabetic \nadvice; assessing skills at tailoring practical dietary advice to suit individuals; and ability \nto give positive v. negative advice e.g. what they can eat as well as what they cannot. \nThe different methods used were: 1, basic questionnaire to assess how useful PN found \nthe nutrition training and how applicable it was in their role as health educators (n  83); \nfrom these eighty-three PN three smaller groups were randomly selected to carry out: 2, \na case-study questionnaire to assess knowledge of NACNEICOMA recommendations \nand understanding of different issues covered in the healthy-eating messages (n  10); 3, \ntape recorded interviews (n  10); and 4, observation interviews by a community dietitian \n(n  10). \nThere was a 78% response rate to the initial questionnaire. Of PN, 74% rated their \nprevious nutritional knowledge as \u2018average\u2019 whereas after training 72% perceived their \nknowledge to be \u2018good\u2019. When discussing dietary issues with patients, after training, 33% \nof PN described their confidence to be \u2018average\u2018, 64% \u2018good\u2019 and 3% \u2018excellent\u2019. Only \none PN felt the information in the training to be too detailed. Input on additional topics \nand the opportunity to sit in with a clinical dietitian was requested by 3196 of PN. \nSix case-study questionnaires were returned. In questions requiring a specific answer \non healthy-eating issues, 50% of PN gave the correct response and in most cases this was \ngreater than 80%. However, when asked what advice they would give a hypothetical \npatient there was still a tendency to offer \u2018blanket\u2019 healthy-eating advice rather than \ntailoring it to the patient. \nTape-recorded interviews proved to be unacceptable to the PN and so these nurses \nagreed to observations. Fourteen PN were visited who saw a total of eighteen patients \nand three groups. Using an assessment checklist each PN was given a score of 0-5 where \nO= \u2018of very little value to understanding\u2019 and 5= \u2018very comprehensive advice\u2019. Scores \nobtained by the PN were 2 (n  2),  3 ( n  12), 4 ( n  4) and 5 (n  3). \nResults obtained from this small study would suggest that given adequate training, \npractice nurses can increase their knowledge and skills to enable them to deliver basic \nhealthy-eating advice. It was highlighted by the PN, however, that this initial training \nshould be followed up by regular study days to ensure PN are kept up to date and have \naccess to expert nutrition advice when needed. This will ensure that nutrition infor- \nmation is based on sound scientific and dietetic principles. In conclusion, PN can be a \nresource to help promote healthy eating. \nVol, 51 M E E T I N G  i)F 27-30 AUGUST 1991 67A \nNutritional knowledge and attitudes towards nutrition education in medical students at \nSouthampton University Medical School. By P. HEYWOOD and S. A. WOOTTON, \nDepartment of Human Nutrition, University of Southampton, Bassett Crescent East, \nSouthampton SO9 3TU \nWhilst several workers have examined the nutritional knowledge and attitudes towards \nnutrition education in medical schools in the United States (Phillips, 1971; Dugdale et al. \n1979; Weinsier et al. 1988), little attention has been directed towards evaluating \nnutritional education in UK medical schools. This study was conducted in order to assess \nthe nutritional knowledge of medical students graduating from Southampton University \nduring Oct-Nov, 1989. In particular we were interested to determine how the nutritional \nknowledge of medical students and their attitudes towards nutrition and nutrition \neducation altered throughout their medical school education. \nA questionnaire consisting of twenty-seven statements and thirteen multiple choice \nquestions covering eight major topic areas considered to be essential to the education of \nmedical students (Weinsier et al. 1989) was completed by medical students in all 5 years \nof training (year 1, n 94; 2, n 96; 3, n 87; 4, n 50; 5, n 51). The respondent was required to \nindicate whether the statement was true or false, or if they could not confidently identify \nthe correct answer to indicate \u2018not sure\u2019. Nutritional knowledge was expressed as both \n\u2018perceived\u2019 and \u2018actual\u2019 knowledge, as described by Dugdale et al. (1979). Eight further \nquestions examined attitudes towards the teaching of nutrition. In addition, the \nquestionnaire was also completed by Humanity students (n  25), State Registered \nDietitians (n  61), Junior Medical Staff (n  44) and General Practitioners ( n  52). \nThe mean nutritional knowledge of Humanity students and Dietitians was 18% (range \n0-33%) and 71% (range 49437%) respectively. The nutritional knowledge of medical \nstudents on admission to medical school was greater than that of Humanity students \n(mean 28%, range 8-59% ; Pc0.01) and increased over the initial 3 years of training \n(Year 3, mean 44%, range 21-77%; FYO.05). There were no significant differences \nbetween the nutritional knowledge of 3rd year medical students and that of final year \nstudents, GPs or Junior Medical Staff. Over 70% of medical students and qualified \nmedical staff self-rated their knowledge of nutrition to be \u2018poor\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019 and \nbelieved that the teaching of nutrition was inadequate; 90% of respondents felt that \nthere should be more taught on the practical application of nutrition support. \nFrom this cross-sectional comparison of nutritional knowledge, it would appear that \nthe nutritional training of the graduating medical student or qualified doctor is \ninadequate. These findings are similar to those reported in an earlier UK study (Brett \net al. 1986) and by other workers in the United States (Phillips, 1971; Dugdale et al. \n1979; Weinsier et al. 1988) and suggest that further attention is directed towards the \nteaching of nutrition within the medical curriculae. \nBrett, A,,  Godden, D.

KENNEDY, \nDivision of Nutritional Sciences, Department of Clinical Medicine, Trinity College, \nUniversity of Dublin, TCD Medical School Building, St JarnesS Hospital, Dublin 8, \nRepublic of Ireland \nIncreased media interest reflects the public concern about food allergy in recent years. \nThat the general public in the UK considers food intolerance to be widespread is \nindicated by prevalence estimates varying between 15% and 30% (Bender & Matthews, \n1981; Burr & Merrett, 1983; Young ef al. 1987), although these cannot reliably \ndistinguish food allergy from intolerance. This degree of public concern raises the \npossibility that inappropriate food avoidance practices may be common. This study was \ndesigned to estimate the perceived prevalence of \u2018food allergy\u2019 in families in Dublin. to \ndetermine the foods most commonly implicated and to explore the extent to which foods \nare avoided. \nSelf-administered questionnaires were distributed to 300 families through a sample of \nprimary schoolchildren selected randomly from the 6th class of thirty schools which had \nbeen selected by stratified random sampling. The overall response rate was 90% (264 \nfamilies). Response rates to attitude questions ranged between 71% and 100%. Of \nrespondents, 24% felt that \u2018food allergy\u2019 was very common (affecting 50\u20187; of people or \nmore) and 49% felt that it was common (affecting 10-50% of people). \u2018Food allergy\u2018 was \nattributed to milk by 28% and to food additives by 26%. Less frequently blamed food \ningredients were artificial colours (ll%), wheat (7%) and E numbers (6%). One or more \nfamily members were reported to suffer from \u2018food allergy\u2019 in 44% (106 families, 139 \nindividuals). This represents a perceived percentage of 8% (139 individuals of the 1734 \nreached by the survey). \nOf the 139 individuals suffering from \u2018food allergy\u2019, 39% (54) were self-diagnosed or \ndiagnosed by a parent. Among the wide range of foods avoided by this group were milk \nin 34% (48), chocolate in 27% (38), artificial colours in 15% (33), sugar in 14% (31), \nfood additives in 14% (31), E numbers in 14% (31), eggs in 10% (22) and wheat in 8% \n(17). In contrast with other studies, cutaneous symptoms were much more commonly \nreported than gastrointestinal symptoms. The diagnosis of food allergy was most \ncommonly made (57%) by food exclusion without challenge. Unorthodox methods of \ndiagnosis, such as hair analysis and vega testing (Katelaris et al. 1990), were rarely \nreported. \nFrom this survey, we conclude that the general public of Dublin feel that food allergy \nis common. One or  more individuals in a large proportion of families avoid foods \nbecause of food allergy, of whom a substantial number avoid staple food items. The \nconcern remains that many of these individuals may be avoiding foods inappropriately. \nS.S. is the recipient of a postgraduate scholarship from the National Dairy Council \n(Ireland). \nBender, A.

HAGGARTY, \nRowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen AB2 9SB \nThirty-two Mexican male adults from diverse social backgrounds in northern Mexico, \ndivided into four body mass index (BMI) groups (<20; 20-25; 26-30 and 31-40: age \nrange 18-40 years), were selected for basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body composition \ndeterminations. Weight range was 51-75-118 kg and height was 1.61-1.89 m. \nBMR was determined in the subjects after an overnight stay at the unit in which an \nevening meal was provided at one-third of their estimated energy requirement based on \nbody-weight (FAO\/WHO\/UNU, 1985). The measurement was performed by means of a \nventilated hood system using a Deltatrac metabolic monitor. The system was regularly \nchecked by analysis of recovered gases from propane gas burns: mean (SD) of 0 2  and \nC02 recoveries were 99.7 (1.8) and 98.7 (1.6) % respectively. Body composition was \ndetermined by 2H20 dilution assuming that the 2H20 dilution space is 1.04 x body water \nand that fat-free mass (FFM) consists of 73.2% water. The isotope dilution protocol \nrequired a blood sample to be taken after an overnight fast for the determination of \nbackground enrichment. Each subject was then given sufficient isotope to raise their 2H \nenrichment by 300 ppm. A second blood sample was taken 4 h after the dose, during \nwhich time the subject did not eat or drink. \nBMR was analysed with body-weight by regression and compared to the values \npredicted using the FAO\/WHO\/UNU equations (1985). These equations overestimated \nmeasured BMR by 6.71,8.44, 5.68 and 4.39% in the four BMI groups respectively. The \noverall difference of 6.3% in all groups was statistically significant when analysed by \npaired t test (P<O-OOl) .  The BMR prediction equation based on weight obtained for \ntwenty-eight of the thirty-two subjects in the 18-30 age range, when compared to the \nFAO\/WHO\/UNU equations for the same age, showed the difference between intercepts \nto be statistically significant (P<O.OOl) by covariance analysis. BMR between the \ndifferent BMI groups was not significant (P=0.82) when expressed per kg FFM as \ndetermined by 2H20 dilution. \nBMI (kglm2) Weight (kg) Fat (%) BMR (kJ\/d) BMR (kJ\/kg BW) BMR (kJ\/kg FFM) \nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD \n18.2 1.4\" 58.5 6.5' 13.7 3.4a 6137 386a 105.5 6.5\" 128.1 9.0\" \n23.0 1.4b 67.7 84a 21.7 3.9b 6590 869a 97.2 2.7a.b 125.5 9.3a \n27.4 1.3c 86.1 6.7b 29.4 3.4= 7748 954b 90.0 8.3b.c 126.9 11.5a \n33.9 2.4d 101-5 11.5' 36.3 5.4d 8698 834b 86.4 9.9C 130.4 11.5\" \na4 Mean values in a vertical column with different supercript letters were significantly different; P<O.OOl. \nThe overestimation of BMR by the FAOMrHOIUNU equations in these subjects is \nsimilar to, if a little less than, those seen in different ethnic groups by Henry & Rees \n(1988).

By T. J .  HORTON, M. SUN and J. 0. HILL, Clinical Nutrition Research \nUnit, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA \nRefinements in the technique of indirect whole-room calorimetry have enabled an \nexpansion of the information relating to energy balance in man. However, one limitation \nwith this technique has been the inability to measure accurately the quantity of physical \nactivity performed by subjects occupying a metabolic chamber. To address this \nmethodological limitation one of our group (MS) designed a force floor which has been \nincorporated into our whole-room indirect calorimeter. This system enables the accurate \nmeasurement of activity whilst simultaneously measuring energy expendit we. \nThe floor (2.5 x 2.5 m) rests on four force transducers positioned at each of its \ncorners. Both the vertical and horizontal movements of an individual can be measured \nand the external work performed can be calculated. The energy cost of the external work \nis computed from the associated incremental change in total energy expenditure \nmeasured by the indirect calorimeter. Calibration of the floor, using a mechanical device \ncapable of delivering a known amount of work to the system, has shown it to be highly \naccurate and reproducible. Combining the floor with the indirect calorimeter enables us \naccurately to break down daily energy expenditure into its component parts, that is, \nsleeping metabolic rate, resting metabolic rate, the energy cost of activity and \nthermogenesis. \nA further application of the system is to the measurement of work efficiency. This is \ndone by comparing the mechanical work of an exercise to its energy cost measured \nsimultaneously. The graph below illustrates the results from a preliminary study \nmeasuring the energy expenditure (EE) and mechanical work (MW) during different \nwalking and step tasks.

SMITH, Rowett Research Institute, \nBucksburn, Aberdeen AB2 9SB \nThe DLW technique is based on a simple principle (Lifson & McClintock, 1966), but \nthere are a number of complicating processes in mammals which have the potential to \naffect the accuracy of the technique. Having quantified three potentially important \nsources of error: 2H incorporation into body fat during growth, 2H losses in methane, \nand 2H losses in the exchangeable groups of faecal solids (Haggarty, 1991), we set out to \nassess the accuracy of the DLW method before and after correction for these processes. \nThe C02 production (rco,) of eight Large White cross (Large White x Landrace) pigs \nwas determined over 21 d using the DLW method and, simultaneously, by continuous \ncollection of C02 in closed-circuit respiration chambers. Four animals were allowed free \naccess to food, achieving a moderate growth rate (group M) of 491 (SEM 101) g\/d and \nfour were fed sufficient food to produce a low growth rate (group L) of 103 (SEM 14) g\/d. \nFat synthesis was determined from 2H incorporation into body fat, methane production \nfrom the change in composition of the chamber air and faecal dry matter content from \ncomplete collection of faeces in the chamber. The values for these variables are given in \nthe Table together with their consequences for the calculation of rco,. \nGroup L Group M \nMean SEM Mean SEM \nStart wt (kg) \nEnd wt (kg) \n33.80 3.058 41.65 3.920 \n35.97 3.319 51.96 5,779 \nChamber rco2 (Yd) 282 21.6 757 79.4 \nDLW rco, (Yd) 264 9.4 636 53.2 \nFat synthesis (g\/d) 10 0.9 120 32.1 \nEffect on rco, (Ud) -4 0.3 - 46 12.4 \nFaecal dry matter (g\/d) 83 3 .0 320 47.2 \nEffect on rco, (Yd) -6 0.2 -22 3.3 \nEffect on r,, (Yd) -1 0.2 -4 1.0 \nMethane production (Yd) 2 0.3 6 1.6 \nDLW-derived r,,, underestimated the true value by 6% in group M and 16% in group \nH.

Most studies of diet and health make the tacit assumption that either a valid \nmeasure of \u2018habitual\u2019 food intake is obtained, or that bias operates equally across all \nsubjects and thus within-study comparisons remain valid. Only independent external \nmarkers of intake can verify these assumptions. \nIn weight-stable populations energy intake (EI) must equal energy expenditure (EE). \nFree-living EE measured by the doubly-labelled water technique (DLW) can thus be \nused to validate EI.

WOO'ITON~, Departments of Vhi ld  Health \nand 2Human Nutrition, University of Southampton, Bassett Crescent East, \nSouthampton SO9 3TU \nThe energy intake and basal metabolic rate (BMR) of pre-pubertal children (twenty-four \nmale, nine female) with chronic asthma was compared with that of thirty-three healthy \ncontrols matched for sex and fat-free mass in an attempt to determine the extent to which \npoor growth in asthmatic children could be attributed to poor energy intake and \nincreased metabolic demand. All asthmatic children received regular inhaled P-agonist \ntherapy; twenty-three received regular inhaled steroid therapy. Energy intake was \nestimated from 7 d records of weighed food intake using computerized food composition \ntables, and BMR was determined by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood. \nThe BMR of the asthma group was significantly greater than controls when expressed \nin absolute units (5.11 (0.12) v. 4.79 (0.10) MJ\/d; mean (SEM), Pc0.05) or as a \npercentage of the BMR predicted (Schofield, 1985) from age, sex and weight (109 (2) v. \n101 (2)%; mean (SEM), P<O.OOl). Despite the elevated BMR, the energy intakes of the \nasthmatic group were comparable with that of the control group whether expressed in \nabsolute units (8.23 (0.34) v. 7.87 (0.22) MJ\/d; mean (SEM), NS) or as energy \nintake:BMR ratio (1.62 (0.06) v. 1.65 (0.04); mean (SEM), NS). Further analysis \nrevealed that these results were not influenced by accounting for differences in stature or \nsteroid usage. These results suggest that whilst the asthmatic children receiving \nconventional inhaled therapy have a slightly greater metabolic demand at rest than \nsize-matched controls in this study, this would be unlikely to contribute to an energy \ndeficit sufficient to limit growth. \nSchofield, W .

By S.  BOND^, J. KOHLER~ and S. A.  WOOITON', Depnrtments of \n'Human Nutrition and 2Child Health, University of Southampton, Bnssett Crescent \nEast, Southampton SO9 3TU \nPrevious studies have demonstrated that children with cancer are adequately nourished \nat diagnosis and that malnutrition in children with cancer may be largely iatrogenic \n(Smith et al. 1990). Attention has been principally directed towards studying the changes \nin energy intake and expenditure during the initial period of intensive treatment \nfollowing diagnosis (Kien & Camitta, 1987). The extent to which the energy require- \nments are satisfied during the longer period of maintenance chemotherapy have not been \nstudied. Energy intake and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were determined in twenty-six \nchildren aged 5-16 years receiving maintenance chemotherapy following attainment of \ncomplete continuous remission at least 6 months after diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic \nleukaemia (three female, thirteen male) or solid tumour (seven female, three male). \nEnergy intake was estimated from 7 d records of weighed food intake using \ncomputerized food composition tables, and BMR was determined by indirect \ncalorimetry using a ventilated hood in the week prior to a chemotherapy block. Skinfold \ncallipers were used to estimate fat-free mass (FFM). The results were conipared against \nthose of age-, sex- and FFM-matched healthy controls.

Both children receiving chemotherapy and \ntheir controls had a mean energy intake: BMR ratio of 1.59. The ranges of 0.96-2.73 \n(chemotherapy) and 1.23-2.46 (control) indicate the variation within each group. These \nresults suggest that neither food intake nor energy expenditure at rest is altered during \nthe period between chemotherapy blocks in paediatric oncology patients undergoing \nlong-term maintenance chemotherapy. \nDepartment of Health and Social Security (1979).

In the present study we examined a group of middle-aged \nsubjects (four females, eight males, aged 58.0 (SD 9-9) years) who were regularly \nattending the Department of Neurology at the Middlesex Hospital for control of their \nParkinson\u2019s disease. Each subject had taken their normal breakfast and anti-Parkinson \ndrugs before 09.00 hours. They did not take their anti-Parkinson drugs thereafter but at \nthe time of measurement of energy expenditure their neuromuscular abnormality was \ncontrolled by injections or infusions of apomorphine. A group of healthy middle-aged \nsubjects without Parkinson\u2019s disease were also measired (thret iemales, five males, aged \n55.0 (SD 5.7) years). Each subject lay under an acrylic hood and energy expenditure was \nmeasured using apparatus and calculations as described by Buchdahl et al. (1988). \nMeasurements were taken for each Parkinson patient while they were in the untreated \n\u2018off\u2019 state, and while in the treated \u2018on\u2019 state after subcutaneous apomorphine. Muscle \nhypertonicity, present in some patients in the \u2018off\u2019 state, was scored (0-3 in each limb). \nPatients with Parkinson\u2019s disease weighed less (mean (SD) 63.0 (7.8) v. 73.6 (10.1) kg \nP<O.Ol), and were thinner (mean (SD) BMI 21.6 (3.16) v. 24.4 (2.29) P<0-04) than \ncontrol subjects. The resting energy expenditure of the Parkinson\u2019s disease group while \ntreated (mean (SD) 75.76 (12.29) J\/kg body-weight per min) was considerably higher \nthan in control subjects (mean (SD) 57-78 (4.24) J\/kg body-weight per min) (P<0.002). \nWithin the Parkinson\u2019s disease group resting energy expenditure was higher in the \nuntreated state (results above; P<0.05), and comparing individual subjects the percent- \nage increase in energy expenditure occurring in the untreated state, compared with the \ntreated state, was related to the severity of muscle rigidity seen in the untreated state \n(P<0.05). These results show that energy expenditure is still elevated in patients with \nParkinson\u2019s disease despite the use of treatment which was sufficient to eliminate any \nParkinsonian tremor or involuntary movement. Furthermore, muscle rigidity is likely to \nbe a factor in the additional increase in energy expenditure seen in the untreated \ncompared with the treated state. \nWe gratefully acknowledge financial assistance from the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Society of \nGreat Britain and the support of Dr. Lees and Dr. Stern of the Neurology Department, \nMiddlesex Hospital, London. \nBuchdahl, R.

The objective of the present study was to relate children\u2019s blood pressure levels to \ntheir mother\u2019s weight in pregnancy. The blood pressures of 675 children aged 1-9 years \nliving in three villages in rural Gambia were measured. In order to reduce observer \nvariation, blood pressure was determined using a DINAMAP (Model 18465X); its \nrelative validity has been determined in comparison with a Hawksley random zero \nsphygmomanometer (Silas et al. 1980). Blood pressure data were matched to antenatal \nclinic data which had been collected from all pregnant women in the three villages since \n1980. Data on maternal weight were available for 351 pregnancies. Further details are \npublished elsewhere (Margetts et al. 1991). \nAmong children under 8 years of age, those born in the dry season had the highest \nblood pressure and were heavier and their mothers gained more weight in the last \ntrimester of pregnancy. Their blood pressures were positively related to body-weight and \nto mothers\u2019 weight at 6 months of pregnancy. These relationships were independent of \nmothers\u2019 age, parity, birth weight, gestational age and placental weight. \nThe Table shows mean systolic pressures with children divided into thirds of mother\u2019s \nweight gain in the last three months of pregnancy. \nWt gain (kg) . . . <1.85 1.85-3.80 >3.80 \n___. \nAge (years) n Mean 95% CI n Mean 95% CI n Mean 95% CI \n1-4 53 93-3 91-96 64 93.4 91-96 59 95.0 92-98 \n5-7 54 98.0 95-101 34 99.6 95-104 40 97.7 96-100 \n8-9 11 104.5 99-110 18 104.1 99-108 18 99.3 100-105 \nThe relationship between children\u2019s systolic pressure (adjusted for age, body-weight \nand time since last meal) at ages 8-9 years and mother\u2019s weight gain ( R 0 . 0 2 )  was \nindependent of weight at 7.5 months, mother\u2019s height and blood pressure. \nAn interpretation of these findings is that among young children differences in blood \npressure are largely determined by rates of maturation. However, the long-term effects \nof adverse intra-uterine influences which elevate blood pressure become apparent in \nolder children. \nBarker, D. J .  P., Winter, P.

PRENTICE, W. A.  COWARD, R. G. WHITEHEAD and L. T. WEAVER, MRC \nDunn Nutrition Unit, Keneba, The Gambia and Cambridge CB4 1XJ \nThe introduction of weaning foods may suppress breast milk intake by increasing satiety \nin the infant or by decreasing the suckling stimulus in the mother. At  the Dunn\u2019s \nGambian field station all infants receive an energy-dense weaning food (4.18 MJ\/kg; \n1000 kcaVkg) initially at 3-6 months. To measure its effect on breast milk intake, infants \nreceived the supplement (aiternately in order of birth) from either 3-12 months (group \nE) or from 6-15 months (group L). \nEighty-eight infants were studied: 12 h breast milk intakes were measured monthly \nfrom 2-9 months by test weighing in sixty-seven infants; 24 h intakes were measured by \nD20 dose-to-mother method at 10,20 and 30 weeks in twenty-one infants. \nThere were no significant differences in maternal anthropometry , parity, infant birth \nweight or gestation length. Infant growth (mean weight-for-age, NCHS standards) was \ninitially faster in group E, but ceased to be so when group L first received the \nsupplement. Growth rates between 6 and 12 months were the same, although group E \nfell behind group L in the period 12-18 months, when the latter were still receiving \nsupplement. There were no significant differences in other anthropometry between the \ntwo groups during the study. The Table shows mean 12 h milk intakes. \nTime of \nsupplement. . .

At 5 months intakes differed by 121 g on 12 h measures \n(P<0-001) and by 228 g on 24 h measures (P<0-05). When change between 3-5 months \nwas examined for mother-infant pairs, using 24 h data, mean differences were -99 g for \ngroup E and +209 g for group L (P<O-OOl) .  Greater milk intake at 5 months by group L \nwas due to both increased feed frequency (Pt0-03)  and average volume (P<O.001). By 7 \nmonths there was no difference in milk intake between groups. \nSupplementary feeds caused acute suppression of breast milk intake, whether \nintroduced first at 3 or 6 months, but this is not long-lasting. When they are introduced \nlate (at 6 months) infant growth rate is not affected, potentially-contaminated feeds are \navoided and infants enjoy optimal intake of immuno-protective breast milk factors. \nVol. 51 M E E T I N G  O F  27-30 A U G U S T  1991 79A \nEffects of maternal tissue protein depletion at parturition on subsequent lactational \nperformance in rats.

SIMM, Scottish Agricultural College, West Mains Road, \nEdinburgh EH9 3JG \nThe nutritional efficiency of milk production, measured as (milk energy):metabolizable \nenergy (ME) intake is presumed to vary for a given diet only in proportion to variations \nin the partial contributions of maintenance, tissue change and the rate of milk secretion \n(ARC, 1980). There have been suggestions (Taylor et al. 1986) of between-breed \ndifferences in maintenance efficiency of lactating cattle and the possibility exists of there \nbeing variations in nutritional efficiency, both partial and gross, within breeds. \nTo study the consequences of selection for fat plus protein (kg) yield in dairy cattle, we \nare measuring food intake, milk output, weight and condition changes in dairy cows over \ntheir first three consecutive lactations with a view to establishing the extent to which \nthere may be real variation in nutritional efficiency within a breed. Results of the first 2 \nyears of this study are reported. \nCows are selected for high (selected) or average (control) weights of combined fat plus \nprotein yield by breeding to bulls of proven merit using AI. Over 2 years, selected (n  59) \nand control (n  66) animals were offered, ad lib., two complete mixed diets differing in \nforage:concentrate proportions over 38 weeks of lactation. Diets contained grass \nsi1age:draff:concentrates (DM basis) in the ratio either 50:5:45 (high concentrate, HC) \nor 75:5:20 (low concentrate, LC) and contained, on average, (per kg\/DM) 11.7 and 11.3 \nMJ ME and 174 and 179 g crude protein (CP) respectively. Input and output data were \nregressed on predicted cow genetic index (CGI). Regressions on predicted CGI were \nsignificantly different from zero for milk (P<O.OOl), fat plus protein yield (P<0.05), \nprotein % (P<O.Ol) and dry matter intake (P<0.05) for HC animals; that for efficiency \napproached significance. For LC animals, the regressions on predicted CGI were \nsignificantly different from zero for milk (P<O.Ol), fat plus protein yield (P<O-OOl) and \nefficiency (P<O.OOl).

BASSETT, \nUniversity of Oxford, The Growth and Development Unit, University Field \nLaboratory, Wytham, Oxford OX2 8QJ \nDuring natural suckling, the nutrition of the lamb and its growth depend vitally on the \nmilk production of the ewe and are therefore primarily influenced by ewe nutrition and \nby the number of lambs suckled. However, hormones of the endocrine pancreas also \nplay vital roles in regulating growth and in reordering metabolic priorities among tissues \nas nutrition varies. \nTo provide further information about the role of these hormones in modulating \nnutritional regulation of growth in sucking lambs, jugular blood samples were collected \nfrom eighty-two lambs once or twice weekly between birth and weaning at 7 weeks of \nage. Prefeeding blood samples were obtained from the ewes at the same time. The ewes \n(Swaledale X Blue Faced Leicester, mated with Suffolk rams) were kept in individual \npens and offered water and hay ad lib., with a concentrate ration twice daily. In the 1989 \nstudy, twenty-eight ewes (six suckling a single lamb, twenty with twins and two with \ntriplets) received approximately 23 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) and 223 g crude \nprotein (CP) daily, while in 1990, two groups of sixteen ewes suckling twins were offered \neither 28 MJ ME and 400 g CP, or 45 MJ ME and 730 g CP each day. No attempt was \nmade to restrict access of the lambs to the food. or to the ewes before sampling, so their \nmetabolite and hormone concentrations should be representative of the entire feeding \ncycle. \nPlasma insulin concentrations in the lambs were influenced markedly both by maternal \nnutrition and by the number suckled. Geometric mean insulin concentrations of the six \nlambs reared as singles in the first study (274 pmol\/l) were fourfold those of the \nthirty-eight lambs reared as twins (66 pmoU1) and sixfold those of the six triplets (42 \npmolh). In the second study, plasma insulin concentrations of the sixteen twin lambs \nsuckled by ewes fed 45 MJ ME daily (275 pmoV1) were approximately twice those of \nlambs suckled by ewes offered half the amount of the same concentrate (145 pmoV1). \nThese differences were closely associated with differences in live weight growth. \nThe rate of live weight gain by all eighty-two individual lambs over the entire suckling \nperiod was highly correlated with their mean plasma insulin concentration ( r  0.81) and \nwith glucose ( r  0.73), but was negatively correlated with plasma free fatty acids ( r  - 0.65) \nand growth hormone ( r  - 0.43), even though GH concentrations in ram lambs were SO% \nhigher than in ewe lambs. Enteroglucagon ( r  0.38), pancreatic glucagon ( r  0.18) and \npancreatic polypeptide ( r  0.36), showed little relation to the rate of lamb growth. Plasma \ninsulin in the ewes, by contrast, showed strong negative associations with lamb live \nweight gain during the first month of lactation in each of the separate groups (1989, r \n- 0-73; 1990, I - 0.89 and r - 0.81). \nDespite the range of maternal nutrition and numbers of lambs suckled, the pattern of \nchanges with age in plasma and pancreatic hormone concentrations in the lambs during \neach of the studies was similar. Glucose and insulin concentrations were highest 1-2 \nweeks after birth and declined steadily until weaning, while pancreatic polypeptide and \nglucagon increased steadily from a nadir 1-2 weeks after birth. The rate of gain by the \nlambs also declined after the first 3 weeks as insulin concentrations declined. \nThese observations reinforce the significance of insulin secretion as a modulator of \nnutritional effects on growth during the suckling period. \n82A ABSTRACTS OF COMMUNICATIONS 1992 \nEffect of rearing neonatal lambs in a cold or warm environment on thermogenesis during \nslow-wave sleep. By C. J. DARBY, L. CLARKE, M. A. LOMAX and M. E. \nSYMONDS, Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, Universify of Reading, \nWhiteknights, Reading RG6 2AJ \nA failure to maintain normal thermoregulatory control mechanisms is a major cause of \nmortality in neonatal lambs. This may be associated with the transition from nonshiver- \ning (NST) to shivering (ST) thermogenesis in response to acute changes in ambient \ntemperature (Ta) over the first 2 weeks of life in the lamb, as brown adipose tissue is \nreplaced by white adipose tissue (Symonds et af .  1989). The following study investigates \nthe extent to which metabolic rate and the ability to respond to warm and cold challenges \nis altered by rearing lambs in warm or cold environments. \nEight sets of twins (mean (SEM) birth weight 5.50 (0.21) kg), all born normally at term, \nwere removed from the ewe on the morning after birth (Day 1) and one lamb was then \nreared in the warm (25\", WR) and its twin in the cold (IS0, CR). They were fed daily a 2 \nlitre volume of milk containing 200 g milk replacer (VOLAC LAMLAC, Royston, \nHerts), and attained a mean growth rate of 80 gld over the study period. Oxygen \nconsumption ( VOJ was then measured during slow-wave sleep after exposure to warm or \ncold Ta for at least 1 h on day 1 and days 7-8 of life. \nOxygen consumption (mumin per kg) \n~~ \nDay 1 Day 7 \nWarm (27.7\") Cold (14.4\") Warm (25.6\") Cold (1 1.7\") \nMean SEM Mean SEM Mean SEM Mean SEM \n~ ~~ \nWR 12.48 0.68 19.92 1.24 14.35 0.70 L9.71 1.94 \nCR 16.37 1.34 21.09 1.15 16.83 1.02 20.36 1.04 \nCR lambs exhibited a significantly higher (P<0.05) Vo2 at a warm Ta than WR \ncontrols. Both groups had a similar Vo2 during cold exposure, but CR 1,ambs showed a \n5040% (P<0.05) lower Vo2 response to cold exposure. At 1 d of age three WR and two \nCR lambs responded to cold via ST, but by 7 d, seven WR compared to three CR animals \nresponded via ST. \nIt is concluded that rearing lambs in a warm environment does not alter their ability to \nincrease metabolic rate in response to an acute cold challenge. At 7 d od age, however, \nWR animals adopted ST rather than NST, suggesting a more rapid loss of brown adipose \ntissue in this group. The level of GDP-binding to uncoupling protein in isolated \nmitochondria1 preparations was 54% higher in CR lambs at 8 d of age (WR 123 (SD 21) \nand CR 189 (sD 31) pmol\/mg protein; P<O-Ol). \nThis work was supported by grants from the AFRC and Wellcome Trust and a MRC \nstudentship (L.C.). \nSymonds, M.

The availability of the doubly-labelled water (DLW) method \nprovides the first non-invasive means of assessing total habitual energy expenditure in \nfree-living subjects. In 1989, forty-two healthy, bottle-fed Hong Kong Chinese infants \nand toddlers were studied. 180xygen (2.8 g\/kg body-weight of 10% lSO) and deuterium \n(0.11 g\/kg body-weight of 99% 2Hz0) were administered orally after which urine \nsamples were collected daily for the following 7-10 d.

Food quotient was used instead of respiratory \nquotient. Ethical approval was obtained from The Chinese University of Hong Kong and \nMRC Dunn Nutrition Centre. \nIt was found that there was a gradual rise of energy expenditure (EE) from 0.34 MJ (82 \nkcal)\/kg per d at 6 months to 0.46 MJ (110 kcal)\/kg per d at 18 months (see Table) \nsuggesting an increase in physiological need of energy for more physical activity. \nEnergy expenditure (EE) of study children in Hong Kong \nEE (MJ (kcal)\/kg body-wt) Weight (kg) Length (cm) \nAge (months) n Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD \n6 8 0.34 (82) 0.11 (26) 7.18 0.72 65.66 2.2 \n9 6 0.38 (90) 0.07 (17) 8.08 0.90 69.12 3-1 \n12 4 0.45 (108) 0.11 (26) 8.91 1.04 72.70 2.9 \n15 7 0.44 (105) 0.14 (33) 9.29 0.23 75.90 1.5 \n18 5 0.46 (110) 0.07 (18) 9.69 0.66 77.64 1.9 \n21 8 0.42 (100) 0.06 (15) 10.28 0.88 81.64 2.3 \n24 4 0.39 (94) 0.08(20) 10.45 0.49 84.05 1.1 \nBetween 6-9 months, the EE of the study infants was lower than the current WHO \nrecommendation for energy requirement (FAO\/WHO\/UNU, 1985), but comparable to \nthose reported by Prentice et al.

HIMES, Division of Human Development and Nutrition, \nUniversity of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA \nThe long-term effect of morbidity on growth remains controversial. Most studies have \nnot addressed the effect of catch-up growth following illness or the confounding effect of \nsocio-economic status. \nWe have measured the growth and morbidity of 129 stunted children and twenty-one \nnon-stunted children for 2 years. Children aged 9-24 months were recruited by a survey \nof poor areas in Kingston, Jamaica. Stunted children were randomly assigned to receive \nnutritional supplementation or not. The supplement comprised 1 kg\/week milk-based \nformula providing 3-1 MJ (750 kcal)\/d if taken completely. Weight and length were \nmeasured every 2 months. A history of any symptoms of illness was taken weekly by \nparaprofessionals. The effect of morbidity on growth was analysed by multiple regression \nusing 2-month child intervals ( n  1759), with change in either weight or length as the \ndependent variables. The number of days ill with apathy, fever, anorexia, nasal \ndischarge, cough, tachypnoea\/dyspnoea, ear infections, vomiting or diarrhoea were \nentered in separate regressions controlling for sex and initial age. The mean effects of \nsymptoms significantly related to growth are shown in the Table. \nTachypnoeal \nApathy Fever Anorexia dyspnoea Diarrhoea \nWt (g\/a ill) -13.2** -15.7*** -3-8* -3.6* -5.0* \nLength ( m d d  ill) -0.25** -0.007 4.004 -0.004 4.11\u201d \n*P<0.05, **P<O.Ol, ***P<O.OOl \nWhen all morbidity variables were offered stepwise, only fever was significant in the \nregression of weight gain, and apathy in the length regression. The unique effect of \ndiarrhoea approached significance (fWO.07) for weight and length. Nutrition group \n(stunted or  not), supplementation group, toilet and water facilities, and crowding did not \ncontribute significantly to any of the regressions. \nTo determine whether there was a long-term effect of morbidity on growth, the \nregressions were repeated using weight and length change over 4 month intervals. \nWeight gain was reduced if apathy, fever and anorexia occurred in the second 2 months \nof the interval. Neither gain in weight nor length was affected by any morbidity in the \nfirst 2 months. Thus, the effects of morbidity on growth in this population were transient. \nVol. 51 MEETING O F  27-30 AUGUST 1991 85A \nBrown fat-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein in adipose tissues of neonatal goats. \nBy PAUL TRAYHURN and JACQUELINE S.  KEITH, Division of Biochemical \nSciences, Rowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen AB2 9SB \nAlthough brown adipose tissue (BAT) is widely recognized to play a significant role in \nthermoregulation and the regulation of energy balance in small rodents, its presence and \nfunction in large, agricultural, species is much less well established. This is partly b., pcause \nthe primary criterion for determining whether an adipose tissue is functionally \u2018brown\u2019 or \n\u2018white\u2019 is now considered to be biochemical rather than histological, BAT being \nidentifiable by the presence of the tissue-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein \nRecent studies have demonstrated that UCP, and hence BAT, is present in newborn \nlambs, cattle, red deer and reindeer (Casteilla et al. 1987; Soppela et al. 1991). Studies \nbased on general histological appearance, together with the ion conductance of \nmitochondria, have suggested that BAT may also be present in the neonatal goat, at least \nin the perirenal region (Vatnick et al. 1987). We have now examined several adipose \ntissue depots of newborn goats for the presence of UCP, using immunoblotting \nprocedures, to establish whether BAT is indeed present in this ruminant species. \nMale goats, British Saanen breed, were obtained from the Rowett herd within 12 h of \nbirth and at 7 d of age (four goats each). Adipose tissues were removed from five distinct \nsites: perirenal, pericardial, omental and subcutaneous (hind limb and neck regions). \nThe tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u201d. Mitochondria were isolated \nand mitochondrial proteins separated according to molecular weight (Mwt.) by SDS- \npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose \nmembranes, and probed for the presence of UCP using a rabbit anti- (ground squirrel \nUCP) serum (Soppela et al. 1991). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with a \ngoat anti-(IgG) horseradish peroxidase-linked conjugate. \nExamination of the immunoblots indicated that immunoreactivity at the 32 000 Mr \nposition characteristic of UCP was present in mitochondria isolated from each of the \nadipose tissue depots, including the subcutaneous, of newborn goats. No immunoreac- \ntivity was evident at any other Mwt. Immunoreactivity consistent with UCP was also \npresent in the adipose tissue depots at 7 d of age, but the amount of the protein was \nreduced relative to the newborn. \nThis study confirms, on the basis of the immunological identification of UCP, that \nBAT is present in the neonatal goat. It also indicates that even subcutaneous adipose \ntissues are functionally \u2018brown\u2019 in newborn goats, an observation consistent with recent \nreports identifying BAT in the subcutaneous region of other ruminants at birth (Casteilla \net al. 1987; Soppela et al. 1991). \n(UCP), Mr 32 000. \nWe are grateful to Dr. John MacRae for providing the goats, and to Mr. Colin Fraser \nand the farm staff for their assistance. \nCasteilla, L., Forest, C., Robelin, J., Ricquier, D., Lombet, A. & Ailhaud, G.

OLDHAM, \nScottish Agricultural College, Edinburgh EH9 3JG \nEvidence suggests that dairy cattle of different milk yield potential may vary in the \nefficiency with which metabolizable energy is used for maintenance (Taylor et al. 1986). \nAs ion transport is a major contributor to metabolic maintenance (Milligan & Summers, \n1986), differences in maintenance efficiency may be manifested in different rates of ion \ntransport activity. Using the activity of erythrocyte Na+,K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) as a \nmeasure of membrane transport we have made an exploratory study on the influence of \ngenotype, diet and stage of lactation on this process. The activity of Mg2+-ATPase (EC \n3.6.1.4) was also measured. \nFirst lactation heifers from the selected (n 18) and control (n 14) genetic lines within \nthe Langhill dairy herd were used. Approximately half (n  17) received a high forage diet \n(0.8 kg forage dry matter (DM)\/kg total DM) and the remainder a high concentrate diet \n(n  15, 0-55 kg forage DWkg total DM). Jugular venous blood samples were taken at \nweeks 8, 19 and 36 post-partum. Erythrocyte membranes were prepared using a \nmodification of the procedure developed by Wheeler & Whittam (1964) and the activities \nof Na+,K+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase were measured (Gilbert & Wyllie, 1976). \nErythrocyte A TPase activities (pmol Pilmg protein per h) \nDietary forage: \nconcentrate \nratio . . , 80:20 55:45 Pooled \nNa+,K+-ATPase Mg+-ATPase Na+,K+-ATPase Mg+-ATPase Na+,K+-ATPase Mg+-ATPase \nWeek Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE Mean SE \n8 0.118 0.028a 0.689 0.108\" 0.163 0.029a 0.702 0.139\" 0.142 0.020a 0.697 0.089a \n19 0.076 0.014a 0.334 0.045b 0.114 0.019a 0.374 0.05Sb 0.096 0.012b 0.356 0.038b \n36 0.045 0.007b 0.293 0.025b 0.065 0.015b 0.241 0.037b 0.056 0.009c 0.264 0.023' \na,b,c Values within columns with different superscript letters were significantly different: P<O.O5. \nBoth Na+ ,K+- and Mg2+-ATPase activities decreased significantly with stage of \nlactation (P<0.05) suggesting that they reflect increased energy expenditure during early \nlactation.

By \nS. BASHIR and R. F. GRIMBLE, Department of Human Nutrition, Southampton \nUniversity, Bassett CreJcent East, Southampton SO9 3TU \nActivated macrophages produce cytokines among which is tumour necrosis factor-a \n(TNF-a). While cytokines are beneficial in combating infections, excessive exposure to \nsome, particularly TNF-a, can be deleterious. The cytokine has been implicated in \nincreased mortality following sepsis and in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \nwhich accompanies that condition (Grimble, 1990). We have demonstrated that fats rich \nin n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) or poor in linoleic acid can modify the \nintensity of the acute-phase response to TNF-a in rats (Mulrooney & Grimble, 1991). In \nthe present study we examine the effects of a range of fats on changes in lung and liver \nprotein metabolism of mice in response to TNF-a. Nutritionally-adequate diets, similar \nin all respects except for the fat source (100 g\/kg), were fed for 7 weeks to weanling MF1 \nmice. The fat in each diet was maize oil (high in linoleic acid), or coconut oil (CO, high in \nshort-chain saturates and low in linoleic acid). or suet (SU, high in medium-chain \nsaturates and monounsaturates, low in linoleic acid) or fish oil (FO (MaxEPA), high in \nn-3 PUFA and low in linoleic acid). The latter three diets contained 10 g maize oiYkg \namong the total fat to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency. Half of each dietary group \nreceived 30 pg recombinant human TNF-a (endotoxin content (2.9 pg\/mg protein) \nintra-peritoneally, the other half received sterile non-pyrogenic saline (9 g sodium \nchloridell). The latter groups were pair fed the intakes of the TNF-a groups. \nTwenty-four h after injection, fractional rates of protein synthesis (FS R) and protein \ncontent of lungs and liver, zinc content of liver and serum caeruloplasmin (CP) were \nmeasured (Schosinsky et al. 1976: Mulrooney & Grimble, 1991). \nDietary fat . . . \nInjection ( n  6lgroup) \nLiver FSR (%\/d) \nLung FSR (%\/d) \nLiver protein (mg\/g) \nLiver Zn (pglg) \nLung protein (mg\/g) \nCP (units\/]) \nMaize oil Coconut oil Suet Fish oil \nSaline TNF-a Saline TNF-a Saline TNF-a \n82 99 \n16 35*'\" \n153 159 \n35 42* \n177 207\"* \n64 100* \n117 99 \n15 27% \n141 150 \n38 39 \n190 199 \n64 149** \n95 78 \n22 20 \n153 141 \n39 38 \n200 204 \n53 113** \nSaline TNF-(U \n91 81 \n24 11** \n169 152 \n42 46 \n231 190** \n70 97 \nSignificantly different from saline group by ANOVA, *P<0.05, **P<O41. \nThe response of liver and lung to TNF-a was modulated to different extents by the \nrange of fats fed. While the increase in liver Zn was blocked by all fats with a low linoleic \nacid content, that of CP was only affected if the fat was rich in n-3 PUFA. The change in \nlung protein FSR was also reduced by all fats low in linoleic acid, but other fatty acid \ncharacteristics exerted a further influence leading to reduction in the case of CO, total \nsuppression in the case of SU and reversal in direction in the case of FO , \nThe authors are grateful to BASF\/Knoll AG, Ludwigshafen and Seven Seas Health Care \nLtd for the gifts of TNF and MaxEPA respectively. \nGrimble, R.

By HILDA \nMULROONEY and R. F. GRIMBLE, Department of Human Nutrition, Southampton \nUniversity, Bassett Cresceni East, Southampton SO9 3TU \nFats low in linoleic acid suppress responses to TNFa (Mulrooney & Grimble, 1991). \nHowever, major differences in the degree of suppression were apparent between rats fed \ncoconut oil and butter. Oleic acid (C18:ln-9) is the major monounsaturated fatty acid of \nbutter (21.5% compared with 6.2% of coconut oil). This study examined whether oleic \nacid content is the major factor responsible for the differences in suppression of \nresponse. \nForty-eight male weanling Wistar rats (mean (SD) weight 63 (2) g), were fed ad fib. for \n8 weeks on one of four 10% lipid synthetic diets, maize oil- coconut oil- oleic oil- or \nbutter-based. The oleic acid diet contained coconut oil supplemented with oleic acid \n(21.5% of total lipid). Diets were isoenergetic and identical in all constituents; all \ncontained 10 g maize oivkg to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency. Half of each group \nreceived 100 kg TNFa\/kg body-weight intraperitoneally; the other half received saline (9 \ng sodium chloride\/l, pair-fed controls). After 24 h, protein synthetic rates were measured \nin the livers, lungs and kidneys using a modified flooding-dose method (Jepson et al. \n1986). Protein and zinc content of the tissues were measured as previously described \n(Mulrooney & Grimble, 1990). Plasma albumin and complement (C3) were measured \nusing rocket immunoelectrophoresis and radial immunodiffusion respectively.

SHE'ITY, Nutrition \nResearch Center, Department of Physiology, St John's Medical College, Bangalore \n560 034, India \nThis study examined the changes in basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body composition \nfollowing acute perturbations in energy intake, in order to assess their physiological \nimportance to chronic undernutrition. Seven, apparently healthy, free-living, \nchronically-undernourished subjects were supplemented with 3.35 MJ\/d (15 g protein, \n34.5 g fat and 105 g carbohydrate) for 12 weeks. Measurements of BMR, body-weight \nand body fat (four skinfold measurements, Durnin & Womersley, 1974) were made \nbefore, and serially during the 12 weeks of supplementation. Five subjects were followed \nup to 12 weeks post cessation of supplementation.

During the 12 weeks of \nsupplementation, BMR was higher than that accounted for by the increases in FFM. This \nwould indicate an increase in the metabolic activity of FFM. An added cost of lipogenesis \nin the fasting state, denoted by a fasting respiratory quotient (RQ) > 1.00, may also have \ncontributed to this increase in BMR (Schutz et al. 1982). When RQs rose above 1.00, a \nsignificant increase in body fat could be demonstrated and when subjects showed no \nfurther accretion of body fat (i.e. by week 9), the RQs declined to basal values. \nTwelve weeks after cessation of supplementation, BMRs were lower even when \nexpressed per kg FFM. This suggests a 'metabolic economy' during the negative energy \nbalance phase, in these individuals. The study demonstrates that changes in the BMR of \nchronically-undernourished individuals are reversible and hence physiologically im- \nportant in their adaptation to low energy intakes. The demonstration of a lower BMR \nwhen expressed per kg FFM, in chronically-Undernourished subjects, probably denotes a \nmetabolic response to an acute or chronic deficit in energy intake. \nThis study was supported by the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi and the \nUnited Nations University, Tokyo. \nDurnin, J.

By G. MCNEILL, D. C. MORRISON, \nL. DAVIDSON and J .  S .  SMITH, Rowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen \nAB2 9SB \nTo investigate the effect of altering energy intake in the form of carbohydrate (CHO) \nwhile maintaining fat and protein intake, five women age 65-71 years, weight 50.65- \n87.05 kg and per cent body fat (by 4 site skinfold thickness) 284-42.8 were studied on a \n5-week residential protocol (McNeill et al. 1989). In weeks 1 , 3  and 5 they received a diet \ncontaining 45% energy (YO En) as CHO, 40% En as fat and 15% En as protein, in \namounts designed to maintain energy balance for each woman. The mean (SD) \nmetabolizable energy (ME) intake for these weeks was 8607 (874) kJ\/d, with 247 g CHO \n(of which 97 g were sugars), 91 g fat and 75 g protein. In week 2, the energy intake was \nincreased by 40% by the addition of CHO only, while in week 4, the energy intake was \nreduced by 40% by the removal of CHO only. Twenty-four h energy expenditure (EE) \nwas measured on day 7 of each week by whole-body indirect calorimetry. Twenty-four h \nnutrient oxidation patterns were determined from 0 2  consumption, COZ production and \nurinary nitrogen excretion on the 7th day. Body-weight was measured to the nearest 50 g \nafter voiding but before breakfast, wearing standardized clothing, on the first morning of \neach week. The results were compared with results for the same subjects from a previous \nstudy in which fat intake was altered and CHO and protein intake held constant on an \nidentical protocol. \nThe Table shows the changes in weight, 24 h EE\/kg body-weight and nutrient \noxidation patterns on day 7 for changes of CHO and fat intake. \nChanges on overfeeding \nCHO Fat CHO Fat \nMean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD \nChanges on underfeeding \nWt (kg) +1.35 0.24 +0.84 0.21 -1.70 0.30 -0.12 0.20 \n24 h EElkg (%) +4.17 2.83 +2.85 2.20 -0.71 2.38 -0.93 1.75 \nCHO oxidation (g) +203.2 38.9 -19.2 30.0 -164.3 86.8 -1.0 19.8 \nFat oxidation (g) 4 2 . 3  17.2 +19.1 10.4 +55.6 20.8 -8.2 7.9 \nProtein oxidation (g) -10.0 7.7 -0.5 8.6 +14.6 4.5 +0.4 8.0 \nWeight changes were more marked for changes in energy intake as CHO in both \noverfeeding ( R 0 . 0 5 )  and underfeeding (P<O.OOl) ,  probably reflecting changes in CHO \nstores. The changes in 24 h EE\/kg on overfeeding were significantly different from zero \n(P<0.05 for both CHO and fat) but there was no significant difference between CHO \nand fat. The changes in 24 h EE on underfeeding were not significantly different from \nzero for either protein or fat. Nutrient oxidation patterns on day 7 were markedly \naffected by changes in CHO intake, while alterations in fat intake produced little effect. \nThe results suggest that large changes in CHO or fat oxidation due to dietary \nmanipulation have relatively little effect on energy balance after 7 d. \nMcNeill, G., Peale, H.
