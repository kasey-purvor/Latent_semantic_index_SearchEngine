A FBG is an UV induced periodic perturbation of the \nrefractive index of the core of an optical fibre. Photosensitivity refers to the tendency of a material to \nsuffer a permanent change in refractive index or opacity induced upon exposure to light. The \nmagnitude of the photosensitivity gives an indication of the amplitude of the refractive index change \nthat may be induced. The photosensitivity of optical fibres is enhanced either by doping the fibre core \nwith elements such as Ge, or Sn, or by soaking the fibre in a high pressure hydrogen atmosphere for a \nnumber of days. One of the commonly used core dopants is germanium. The high pressure hydrogen-\nloading technique has been recognised as an efficient means of achieving ultrahigh photosensitivity in \nGeO2-doped fibres [2]. Hydrogen loading is also a common method used to allow FBGs to be \nfabricated in fibres such as standard telecommunication fibres, which have a low germanium content.  \n \nA full understanding of the factors that contribute to the photosensitivity, and of the reasons why \n 3\nhydrogen loading increases the magnitude of the refractive index change that may be induced by UV \nirradiation, has not been reached. A number of theories have been proposed based on observations and \nassumptions. Two principal mechanisms are claimed: structural densification and colour centre \nformation [3]. UV-induced densification has been proposed by several investigators to account for the \nformation of FBGs in Ge doped fibres [4, 5]. In such germanosilicate optical fibres, a structural change \nof the glass in the fibre core into a more compact configuration has been observed using transmission \nelectron microscopy (TEM) [6]. Periodically spaced dark fringes in the core of tin doped \ngermanosilicate fibre were observed in a thin film obtained by grinding and polishing the fibre. These \ndark regions were believed to be composed of dense regions of glass which were induced at the \nlocation of the bright UV fringes. However no such pattern was observed in the FBGs fabricated in \nhydrogenated fibres using TEM [7]. Based on this investigation, it was suggested that the UV induced \ndensification could account for a large part of the refractive index modulation induced in rare earth \nelement-doped fibres, but that it was not applicable to the hydrogen loaded germanosilicate fibres. This \nsuggests that a different mechanism is responsible for the formation of FBGs in hydrogen loaded fibres.  \n \nTwo theories have been proposed to explain the photosensitivity increase caused by hydrogen loading. \nFirstly a colour centre model has been suggested to account for the photosensitivity of hydrogen loaded \nfibres [7]. In the model, UV light photoionizes some bleachable defects of the germanosilicate glass. \nElectrons released from these defects are free to move to other defect sites. The resultant refractive \nindex change is linked simply to the photoinduced change in absorption through the Kramers-Kronig \nrelationship. Secondly, it has been proposed that a chemical reaction takes place in the presence of \nhydrogen [8]. In hydrogenated fibres an increase of absorption loss at the first overtone of the O-H \nvibration at a wavelength of 1.27\u03bcm is observed over a period of time [9]. This observation is \nattributed to the reaction of the hydrogen with oxygen to form hydroxyl ions. The formation of a \nhydroxyl group changes the refractive index. In addition, in hydrogen loaded germanosilicate fibres, \n 4\nthe reaction between Ge-ions and hydrogen forms GeH, changing the band structure in the UV. These \nchanges influence the local refractive index according to the Kramers-Kronig model. Kashyap [10] \nstated that all three mechanisms could prevail in optical fibres. The contribution of each mechanism \ndepends on the type of optical fibre and photosensitisation process. \n \nChanges in the surface topology of optical fibres associated with UV induced refractive index changes \nhave not been revealed previously directly under microscopic observation. Poumellec et al [5] first \nused the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technique to observe surface modulation on slices of \nGe:SiO2 preforms following grating inscription. However, due to the restrictions of the technique at \nthat time, this investigation was made on planar slices of material rather than on optical fibres. The \nslices were comprised of a SiO2 cladding doped with B2O3 and P2O5 deposited upon a GeO2-doped \ncore. A surface corrugation pattern was observed following the inscription of FBGs in the slices, from \nwhich the densification mechanism was determined to be responsible for the photosensitivity. The \ninvestigation reported here explores the structural change induced on the primary optical fibre surface \nby UV irradiation. The surface topology of Ge-B-doped fibres and hydrogen loaded fibres are \ncompared.  \n \n2  FIBRE BRAGG GRATING FABRICATION PROCESS \n2.1  Optical fibres and the hydrogen loading process \nThe investigation was carried out using two types of fibres: standard telecommunication fibres (SM-\n1322\/P3022-E, supplied by Optical Fibres, Deeside) and germanium-boron-codoped fibres (Fibercore \nPS1250). Fibrecore PS1250 optical fibre is composed of a silica cladding and a core of 5% wt germania \nwith boron phosphorus doped-silica to enhance the photosensitivity. Both types of fibres are single-\nmode with a 125 \u03bcm diameter cladding and a polyacrylate coating with a cut-off wavelength of \n1250nm. Prior to the inscription of FBGs, samples of the Ge-B codoped fibres were placed in a \n 5\nhydrogen chamber at 120 bars for seven days at 25\u00b0C, while the standard telecommunication fibres \nexperienced hydrogen-loading at 135 bars for 9 days, also at 25\u00b0C. Both hydrogen loaded and non-\nhydrogen loaded fibres were used for FBG inscription. \n \nThe polyacrylate buffer coating exhibits a large absorption in the UV, requiring its removal prior to UV \nirradiation of the fibre. The fibres were soaked in a proprietary paint-remover to remove a 20 mm long \nsection of the polyacrylate coating, and a lens tissue soaked with acetone was used to remove the \nresidual coating. \n \n2.2  UV-irradiation process and AFM observation \n \nAn injection seeded frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm with a pulse width of 5 \nns and 10 Hz repitition rate was used to fabricate the FBGs. The FBGs were fabricated in the stripped \nsection of the fibres using a phase mask configuration [11], as shown in Fig. 1. The period of the phase \nmask was 910nm and the Bragg wavelength of the FBGs was 1320 nm. The exposure time for each \nFBG was 60 s.  \n \nFour different exposure regimes were exploited to examine the influence of the laser energy on surface \nchanges caused by the exposure. A cylindrical lens was used to produce a line focus parallel to the axis \nof the fibre, and the laser energy was controlled to produce average pulse intensities of 2.0, 2.4, 2.8 and \n3.2 W\/cm2. The side of the fibre that faced the UV beam was carefully marked. The location of the \nexposure centre and the 6mm long exposure region were also marked. Hydrogen loading the \nphotosensitive fibre had the effect of increasing the reflectivity from 27% to 60% when the FBGs were \ninscribed under an average intensity of 2.4 W\/cm2 for 60s. Under the same exposure condition, the \nFBGs written in hydrogen-loaded standard telecom fibres had a similar reflectivity as the \n 6\nphotosensitive fibres. However, the FBGs in non-hydrogen loaded telecom fibres were so weak that the \nreflectivity was not measurable. \n \nThe AFM technique examines the surface topography of an object through a fine ceramic or \nsemiconductor tip scanning over a surface. The tip is positioned at the end of a cantilever beam. As the \ntip is repelled by or attracted to the surface, the cantilever beam deflects. The magnitude of the \ndeflection is detected using a laser. The detected signal is amplified by a lock-in amplifier, and then \nconverted into a vertical deflection using the z-axis sensitivity of the AFM. A plot of the laser \ndeflection versus tip position on the sample surface provides the surface topography with peaks and \ntroughs.  \n \nThe AFM observation was performed using a Digital Instruments DimensionTM 3000 SPM under \ntapping mode in which the tip taps across the surface at a frequency of 1 Hz. The advantage of using \ntapping mode is that the lateral forces are virtually eliminated, so there was no scraping of the surface \nunder the probe tip. The tip scanned an area of 10\u00d710 \u03bcm2 on the surface of the fibre. The AFM \nscanning was performed on fibre samples prepared as detailed in Table 1. For the FBGs fabricated in \nGe-B codoped fibres with and without hydrogen loading under 2.0 W\/cm2 exposure, the AFM \nobservation was conducted at the location of the centre of the UV exposure, and repeated at positions \n\u00b11 mm, \u00b12 mm, and \u00b13 mm away from the central exposure point.  \n \n \n3  AFM SURFACE IMAGES  \n \n3.1 Comparison of surface images of the UV-irradiated surface with those of non-UV-irradiated surface  \nThe AFM images revealed that the UV-exposure produced a spatially periodic surface relief pattern on \n 7\nthe exposure surface (surface facing the UV beams during fabrication) for all types of fibres. Figure 2 \nshows the pattern that appeared on the photosensitive fibres which were exposed to UV radiation at an \naverage intensity of 2.4 W\/cm2. The bright stripes on the 2-D image (Fig. 2b) correspond to the peaks \nof the surface relief pattern while the dark areas correspond to the troughs (or valleys). This periodic \npattern can be seen clearly in the 3-D image (Fig. 2 c). The white spots observed in Fig. 2b, are \nprobably caused by the natural surface coarseness and debris left on the fibre surface by the stripping of \nthe buffer coating. Taking a line across the 2-D surface (Fig. 2b), allows the vertical profile to be \ndisplayed as shown in Figure 2a. The cross-section roughness spectrum exhibits peaks and troughs \naligned with the axial direction of the fibres. The amplitude of the corrugation is defined as the vertical \ndistance from the minima of the troughs to the surface level that excludes features attributed to surface \ncontamination which is shown as the hills above the surface level, as seen in Fig. 2a. The average \nperiod of the relief pattern determined from the AFM images was 455 nm, which is equal to the period \nof the interference fringes generated by the phase mask. This value is in agreement with the period of \nthe Bragg gratings formed in the fibre core, which gives the Bragg wavelength of 1320nm. The surface \nrelief pattern period indicates that the surface troughs are the location of the bright interference fringes \nand that the horizontal level of the surface peaks is the surface level prior to irradiation. The energy of \nthe UV irradiation appears to alter the topography of the pristine glass. \n \nThe 2-D and 3-D images obtained from a region on the surface of the optical fibre that had not been \nUV irradiated are shown in Fig. 3. When the observation was made on the region outside of the 6.0 mm \nirradiated section, there is no sign of the periodic pattern observed in Figure 2. The 3-D image shows \nthe surface roughness with a number of peaks associated with surface contamination. The cross-section \nroughness analysis in Fig. 3a indicates a 0.7 nm vertical distance from the peaks to the troughs of the \nnatural surface roughness, which is half of the value seen following irradiation. \n \n 8\nFigure 4 shows an AFM image of a section of fibre lying within the irradiated region, but facing away \nfrom the incident UV beams. No corrugation pattern is observed on the rear surface of the FBGs, \nthough a number of the irradiated fibres were examined using AFM. The UV-irradiation had no \ninfluence on the rear surface of the fibre. This is due to the reduction of UV power intensity through \nthe silica glass. The UV intensity was measured along the beam profile width at the position where was \nbehind the rear surface of the fibre. The measurement was repeated at the same position when the fibre \nwas removed. Figure 5 shows the UV intensity distribution in these two cases. The U-shape in the \ndistribution curve with the presence of a fibre indicates that a large quantity of UV energy was \nabsorbed by the fibre. Upto 22% UV intensity remained at the central location of the fibre. This implies \nthat the UV interference fringes that reach the rear surface possess only 22% energy which is below the \nintensity required to alter the surface topography.  \n \nThese observations reveal that the surface morphology of the irradiated sections containing FBGs is not \nsymmetrical. The asymmetrical structure may have an impact on the optical and mechanical \nperformance of the FBG. The mechanical strength of the fibre has been shown previously to be reduced \nfollowing UV-irradiation [12, 13]. In Cordier\u2019s work [6], following grating inscription, microcracks \nrunning between the dark and light regions were evident in preform slices which were ion-milled for \nTEM observation. The fringes of the gratings appear as the dark band in the TEM images as a result of \nstructural densification. Stress concentrations may exist in the interface between the valley and peak of \nthe surface relief pattern that could lead to the initiation of cracks, resulting in a low failure stress. \n \n3.2  Amplitude of the surface relief pattern for different regions of the UV-irradiated section  \n \nThese observations were conducted on the Ge-B codoped fibres in hydrogen-loaded and non hydrogen-\nloaded conditions. Both fibres were exposed using an average intensity of 2.0 W\/cm2. The AFM probe \n 9\nscanned a 10\u00d710 \u03bcm2 area at 1.0 mm intervals from the beginning of a 6.0 mm long irradiated section. \nThe 2-D surface images obtained are shown in Figures 6 and 7. Each figure contains 4 images \nrepresenting the observed area at the centre of the irradiated region and at positions 1 mm, 2 mm and 3 \nmm away from the centre.  \n \nFigure 8 shows the amplitude of the surface relief pattern as a function of the position of the irradiated \nregion. The amplitude decreases away from the centre of the irradiated region, with the highest value \nlocated at the centre of the region. In Fig. 8, the UV beam profile shows the intensity distribution along \nthe irradiated region.  For both fibres, the change of the surface relief amplitude with distance matches \nthe spatial distribution of the intensity of the UV irradiation. The UV-intensity distribution follows a \nGaussian profile with a full width half maximum of 6.0 mm. The AFM observed that the surface relief \nappeared within the 6.0mm central region of the irradiated area. In Fig. 8, it can be seen that the UV \nintensity decreases to 50% of its peak value when the position is 3.0 mm away from the irradiated \ncentre. The UV interference fringes outside of the 6.0 mm central region had inadequate power to \ncreate the surface modulation. Thus, the intensity of the laser energy has a direct impact on the \nformation of the surface troughs. There is a direct correlation between the intensity of the UV \nirradiation and the amplitude of the surface relief pattern. Hydrogen loading the optical fibres appears \nto magnify the effect, leading to an increase in the amplitude of the surface relief pattern. As shown in \nFigure 8, the amplitude of the UV-induced corrugation on the hydrogen loaded photosensitive fibres \ndouble the value measured on the non-hydrogen loaded fibres.  \n \n3.3  Amplitude of surface relief pattern for different types of fibres and laser pulse energy \n \nTo compare the difference of the surface relief pattern in different types of fibres under different laser \npulse energies, the measurements were made at the centre of the exposure region for all the fibres. \n 10\nRegardless of the type of fibre, all irradiated surfaces show a corrugation pattern with the same period \n(455 nm). Fig. 9 shows the irradiated surface of a standard telecom fibre. A periodic pattern with a 1.91 \nnm amplitude is clearly seen. Standard telecom fibres have little photosensitivity to form FBGs. The \nUV-induced pattern observed in this case suggests that no direct link exists between the surface relief \nand the change of refractive index in the fibre core.  \n \nFigure 10 shows the amplitude of the surface relief pattern measured from AFM images of four types \nof fibres which were exposed to different levels of laser power. There are two significant observations \nthat can be made. Firstly, for the same type of fibre, the surface relief amplitude is a function of the \nlaser power. In the Ge-B codoped fibres, the amplitude increases from 1.24 to 2.09 nm when the \naverage pulse density rises from 2.0 to 2.8 W\/cm2. The standard telecom fibres show a similar trend, \nthe amplitude increasing from 1.91 to 3.14 nm as the laser power raised from 2.4 to 3.2 W\/cm2. This is \nconsistent with the data in Fig. 8 where the amplitude of the surface pattern was strongly correlated to \nthe distribution of laser power within the irradiated region.  \n \nSecondly, the irradiated surface of both standard telecom and photosensitive fibres which were \nhydrogen-loaded demonstrates a larger surface relief amplitude than that observed on the fibres that \nwere not hydrogen loaded. Under the same exposure parameters, the amplitude of hydrogenated \nstandard telecom fibres is 2.4 nm, which is 25% higher than that observed on the non-hydrogenated \nfibres. Hydrogen loading the photosensitive fibres enhances the amplitude of the surface relief pattern \nover 100% compared to the non-hydrogenated photosensitive fibres.  \n \n4  MECHANISMS FOR THE FORMATION OF SURFACE RELIEF PATTERNS \n \nThe AFM observations show that the spatially modulated UV irradiation alters the surface topography \n 11\nof glass fibre, resulting in a periodic pattern with a series of peaks and troughs. The pattern observed on \nthe standard telecom fibres, which is known to have low photosensitivity, indicates that the surface \nchange may not be linked to the formation of FBGs in the fibre core. However, hydrogen loading \nenlarges the magnitude of the surface relief pattern as well as increasing the photosensitivity. The \nsurface relief period closely matches the FBG period. It is not clear whether the surface structure \nchange interferes with the change in the fibre core during the FBG inscription.  \n \nA consideration of the thermal decay phenomena [14] may aid the understanding of this issue. The \nthermal decay of a FBG describes the phenomena of the reversal of the change in refractive index at \nelevated temperature. The thermal degradation of the refractive index modulation results in a reduction \nin the peak reflectivity and a small reduction in bandwidth of the FBG. It was observed that the decay \nof FBGs fabricated in hydrogen loaded fibres is more significant than that of FBGs fabricated in fibres \nthat were not hydrogen loaded.  \n \nTwo mechanisms have been proposed to explain the thermal reversal of the refractive index \nmodulation. The first is associated with an activation barrier Ea1[15]. With thermal assistance, the UV \ninduced defect overcomes the activation energy barrier, with the result that its contribution to the \nmodulation is reduced, and grating decay occurs. Corresponding to this theory is the colour centre \nmechanism that electrons in glass are displaced and trapped in the modulation sites. At elevated \ntemperatures, these electrons are released and reversed, resulting in the thermal decay phenomenon.  \nThe second theory is associated with densification mechanisms. Douay et al [7] observed that the \namplitude of the surface relief pattern in a non-hydrogen loaded boron co-doped germanosilicate \npreform slice decreased, eventually becoming too low to measure, when the slice had been annealed at \n650\u00b0C. The disappearance of the surface relief, correlated with the reduction of the reflectivity of the \nFBGs, appears to support the densification model. This observation indicated that the surface relief \n 12\npattern is responsible for the refractive index modulation. This pattern could be reversed at an elevated \ntemperature that may relax the glass structure. However, the same investigators did not find the \nperiodically dark regions in the core of hydrogen-loaded fibres from their TEM observation, which \nseems not to support the densification theory associated with hydrogen-loaded fibres.  \n \nThe thermally induced decrease of the refractive index modulation of the core has been found to follow \na power law [15]. This indicates that there is a permanent structural change by the UV-exposure \nprocess, which is irreversible. The AFM observation reveals that the surface relief is influenced by \nboth laser power density and the presence of hydrogen. The structure compaction must be the result of \nthe interaction between the UV energy and compositions in the glass. According to a theory proposed \nby Fokine [8], the UV-irradiation induces a photochemical reaction to form hydroxyl-groups under the \npresence of hydrogen. The periodic formation of hydroxyl-groups results in the periodic variation of \nthe refractive index in the fibre core. The similar photochemical reaction would occur on the fibre \nsurface due to the presence of hydrogen which may decompose the silicate glass molecular structure by \nbreaking up the bonds between the silicon and oxygen atoms in the form of: \n \nThe appearance of Si-H and Si-O-H vibration bands was detected by Infrared (IR) spectra in the \nirradiated hydrogen-treated silica glass [16]. In hydrogen loaded germania-doped silica glass, upon \nUV-irradiation, various H-bearing species including H2, SiOH, GeOH, SiH, GeH were identified in the \nIR measurements [17]. This evidence indicates that the interaction of UV energy and hydrogen alters \nthe microstructure of glass by breaking the bonds and reforming new bonds and molecular groups. It is \nnot clear if this change contributes to the structural compaction on the surface. However, the presence \nof hydrogen under the assistance of UV-laser energy may weaken the silicate molecular network which \n 13\nleads to the lower FBG strength and the deeper surface relief pattern on the hydrogen-loaded fibres.  \n \nThe permanent part of the structural change is likely to be induced directly by the UV-energy. The \nexistence of photo-ablation may be assumed, as the amplitude of the surface modulation is closely \nrelated to the intensity of the UV-energy. Based on the densification model, standard telecom fibres \nwith little photosensitivity can exclude the existence of photo-induced densified structure. The \ncompaction surface relief pattern observed on the standard telecom fibre may result from the effect of \nphotoablation which melts the silica glass and reforms local compact structures. The refractive index \nmodulation remaining after thermal annealing may also be attributed to the photo-ablation effect as it \nbrings irreversible structural change. In germanosilicate fibres without hydrogen loading, this \nphotoablation may play a major role in the formation of the surface troughs. Both photoablation and \nchemical reaction may contribute to the surface relief pattern of hydrogenated fibres. \n \n \n \n5  CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe primary surface of Ge-B-codoped fibres and standard telecom fibres with\/without hydrogen \nloading was observed using AFM. The following conclusions can be made: \n1) A periodic corrugation pattern induced by the UV exposure was observed on the surface of the \nfibres investigated. The surface relief period corresponds to that of the interference fringes \ngenerated by the phase mask.  \n2) The surface relief pattern exists only on the side of the fibre oriented toward the irradiating UV \nlaser beam. This indicated that there is a photoinduced structural change on the surface of the \ncladding.  \n 14\n3) The amplitude of the corrugation in a range of 0.7-3.2 nm is dependent on both the intensity of the \nlaser power and the presence of hydrogen. The spatial envelope of the amplitude of the corrugation \nis correlated with the intensity profile of the UV-beam.  \n4) Although the period of the surface corrugation mirrors to the period of the Bragg gratings in the \ncore, the observation of the corrugation on the irradiated telecom fibre surface indicates no direct \nlink between the surface relief and the change of refractive index in the core. Photo-ablation \nappears responsible for the surface compaction troughs.  \n5) Hydrogen loading the Ge-B codoped fibre prior to UV irradiation increased the amplitude of the \ncorrugation with a value doubled that observed in the fibre not subjected to hydrogen loading. \n \n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe authors would like to give their sincere thanks to Ms Christine Kimpton for her skill and patience \nwith the AFM investigation.
