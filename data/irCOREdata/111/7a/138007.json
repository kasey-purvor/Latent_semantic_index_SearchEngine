The use of pesticides and fertilis-\ners has subsequently been linked in the literature2\u20136\nto the contamination of groundwaters. With a drink-\ning water pesticide content of 0.1 \u00b5g litre\u22121 as the\nmaximum admissible concentration within the EC\u2019s\nlegislation, the number of potable groundwater sites\npotentially exceeding this may increase.\nIt has, however, been found that natural attenuation\nof pesticides can occur in some of these contaminated\ngroundwaters. A variety of studies have focused on\nrecording this process either in situ7\u201310 or through\nlaboratory observations using indigenous bacteria\nfrom contaminated sites.11\u201315 In these studies,\nbiological degradation was found to occur with\na varying level of efficacy where aquifer pesticide\nconcentrations exceeded 40 \u00b5g litre\u22121. Where this\noccurred, it was associated with acclimatised bacterial\ncommunities featuring positive degraders of the\ncompound.8\u201310 From these studies we find that\npesticide concentrations >40 \u00b5g litre\u22121 can select for\nan indigenous bacterial community with specific\npositive degraders which are capable of undertaking\npesticide degradation.\nUnfortunately, few directed studies have been\nundertaken16\u201319 to monitor natural attenuation of\ndiffuse concentrations of pesticide in groundwa-\nter (<10 \u00b5g litre\u22121). Results by Purcarevic\u00b4 et al.16\nindicated the presence of both atrazine (average\n0.198 \u00b5g litre\u22121) and common metabolites in a large-\nscale survey of near-surface aquifers in Vojvodina\nprovince, Serbia. Although degradation products of\natrazine were found, these results can be questioned\nas to whether they were derived by the actions of\nsoil or groundwater bacteria. Larsen and Aamand17\nindicated that no degradation of a 25 \u00b5g litre\u22121 spike\nof atrazine occurred independently of the oxidative\ncondition used in relation to the two sandy aquifers\nthat were tested. This was in agreement with an earlier\npaper by Larsen et al.18 where atrazine degradation\n\u2217 Correspondence to: Elise Cartmell, School of Water Sciences, Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire MK43 0AL, UK\nE-mail: e.cartmell@cranfield.ac.uk\n\u2020Based on a presentation at the 4th International Symposium on Environmental Aspects of Pesticide Microbiology: Pesticides, Microbial\nFunctions and Biodiversity in Soil, held at Thessaloniki, Greece on 4\u20139 September 2004\nContract\/grant sponsor: UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council\nContract\/grant sponsor: WRc plc\n(Received 9 June 2005; revised version received 16 October 2005)\nPublished online 9 February 2006\n\uf6d9 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.

These examples suggest that\nthe atrazine degradation products monitored in the\ngroundwaters of Vojvodina province16 were simply\nfrom the leaching of the soil profile. These exam-\nples do not demonstrate any evidence that the diffuse\ngroundwater pesticide concentration has resulted in an\nacclimatised bacterial community capable of undertak-\ning degradation.\nThe work reported in this paper was designed to\ninvestigate whether any prevalent microbial adaptation\nhad occurred to degrade atrazine (2-chloro-N2-\nethyl-N4-isopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,6-diamine) within\na diffusely contaminated (\u223c0.2 \u00b5g litre\u22121) shallow\nchalk aquifer. We used a simple nutrient regime\nfeaturing glucose as the sole carbon source and\nPseudomonas sp. strain ADP20 as a positive control.\nThese treatments were designed on the basis of\nproviding efficacy information in response to the\napplication of future in situ bioaugmentation methods.\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1 Field site\nGroundwater was used from an unconfined middle\nupper chalk aquifer with a shallow water table <5 m\nin depth. Groundwater monitoring had previously\nindicated that this site contained atrazine and\nnitrate concentrations periodically in excess of the\n0.1 \u00b5g litre\u22121 and 50 mg litre\u22121 parametric values (PVs)\nof the EC drinking water directive EC 98\/83EEC.\nMonitored concentrations of atrazine and nitrate had\ntypically been shown to occur within the ranges\n0.02\u20130.2 \u00b5g litre\u22121 and 11.6\u201325.1 mg NO3-N litre\u22121\nrespectively. This water is currently being treated\nusing ion exchange and granular activated carbon to\nensure compliance with the UK Water Supply (Water\nQuality) 2000 regulations.\n2.2 Chemicals\nAtrazine (97.4% pure) was a gift from Oxon Italia\nSpA. Methanol and the far-UV-absorbent acetonitrile\nused in experiments and analysis were of high-\nperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade\n(Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). All water\nused (MilliQ water) in experiments and analysis\nwas supplied from an ELGA Purelab Option-S 7\/15\nmodule used in conjunction with an ELGA Ultrapure\ngenetic module (ELGA, High Wycombe, UK). All\nother chemicals were supplied by Fisher Scientific and\nwere of reagent grade or better.\n2.3 Microbial growth media and atrazine\nspiking solution\nThe minimal mineral salts liquid (Glu-MMSL)\nmedium was derived from a concentrated stock\nsolution and designed for periodic amendment at\nlow volume from this.21 Two separate concentrated\nstock solutions were used (buffer and salts), giving the\nfollowing concentrations per litre of batch fluid when\nadded at volumes of 4 and 0.5 ml litre\u22121 respectively.\nThe buffer constituent of the Glu-MMSL medium\ncreated batch fluid concentrations of glucose 159,\nKH2PO4 25, NaH2PO4\u00b72H2O 100, MgSO4\u00b77H2O\n10 and NH4Cl 300 mg litre\u22121. The salts constituent\nof the Glu-MMSL medium created batch fluid\nconcentrations of H3BO4 3, MnSO4\u00b7H2O 2, CuSO4\n0.4, ZnCl2 0.2, CoCl2\u00b76H2O 0.4, Na2MoO4\u00b72H2O\n0.3 and FeCl3\u00b76H2O 1 mg litre\u22121, with concentrated\nH2SO4 5 ml litre\u22121 to retard precipitation of the salts.\nBoth Glu-MMSL media constituents were prepared\nin MilliQ water and filter sterilised before use. The\nglucose in the buffer solution was the sole amended\ncarbon source at a ratio of Glu-C\/NO3-N = 4:1 based\non an analysed groundwater NO3-N concentration\nof 15.90 mg litre\u22121 (Merck Nitrate Spectroquant cells\nin a Nova 60 spectrophotometer, Merck Ltd, West\nDrayton, UK). The actual addition of glucose was\ncalculated in relation to this groundwater NO3-N load\nbut in reference to batches being composed 80%\nby volume of groundwater. The remaining 20% by\nvolume was composed of inoculum and the relevant\nmedia. Liquid and solid atrazine media containing\nsucrose and sodium citrate carbon sources at 1 g litre\u22121\nwere used as described by Mandelbaum et al.20 This\nmethodology was altered for the atrazine spikes, which\nwere not dissolved in methanol, and cycloheximide\n50 mg litre\u22121 was omitted.\nThe atrazine spiking solution was prepared in\nMilliQ water, as no additional carbon sources could\nbe added to the sacrificial batch trials. Owing\nto the relative insolubility of atrazine in water\n(\u223c70 mg litre\u22121), a 10 mg mass was added to 1 litre of\nautoclaved MilliQ water, shaken for 24 h at 140 rpm\n(Gallenkamp Orbital incubator, Sanyo, Crawley,\nUK) and filtered (Millipore 0.22 \u00b5m \u00d7 47 mm GSWP\nfilters, Fisher Scientific) before being analysed by\ndirect HPLC analysis. All apparatus used throughout\nwas autoclaved before use (121 \u25e6C for 15 min in a\nPriorclave autoclave, Priorclave Ltd, Woolwich, UK).\nAll media solutions were filter sterilised before use\n(Millipore 0.22 \u00b5m \u00d7 47 mm GSWP filters, Fisher\nScientific).\n2.4 Indigenous groundwater bacteria and\nPseudomonas sp. strain ADP inocula\nInocula used were at 10% of batch volume.\nThe indigenous groundwater bacterial inoculum\nwas obtained from groundwater amended with\nthe Glu-MMSL medium. This was grown under\nshaken (140 rpm; Gallenkamp Orbital incubator,\nSanyo) aerobic conditions, amended with Glu-MMSL\nmedium at 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks, and used after 7 weeks.\nThe purpose of this inoculum was to remove the\nlag phase in the experiment, allowing the indigenous\ngroundwater batch system to be comparable to the\ninoculation of a liquid culture of Pseudomonas sp.\n300 Pest Manag Sci 62:299\u2013306 (2006)\nIn situ degradation of atrazine in groundwater\nstrain ADP in an equivalent system, which was used\nas the positive control.\nThe Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP liquid inoculum\nwas produced by inoculating single actively degrading\ncolonies monitored on solid atrazine medium20\ninto 20 \u00d7 20 ml glass universals (Fisher Scientific)\ncontaining liquid atrazine medium.20 Universals that\nindicated degradation of atrazine after 7 days (data\nnot shown) were combined to form a 10% inoculum\n(100 ml) in 2 \u00d7 1 litre glass Duran bottles (Fisher\nScientific) containing fresh liquid atrazine medium.20\nGrowth and atrazine degradation by Pseudomonas\nsp. strain ADP were monitored by optical density\n(OD) readings at 600 nm using 1.5 ml plastic cuvettes\n(Fisher Scientific) on a Jenway 6505 UV\u2013visible\nspectrophotometer (Jenway, Felsted, UK) and HPLC\nanalysis respectively. These batches were subsequently\nused as the 10% inoculum in sacrificial batch trials.\n2.5 Sacrificial batch studies\nThese studies were performed unshaken within a\ntemperature-controlled room at 16 \u25e6C under both\nopen and sealed conditions. Duplicate batches were\ncreated for testing the groundwater bacteria (GW-\nMMSL) and the Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP batches,\nwhere MilliQ water was used as controls.\nEach individual batch contained a start volume\nof 1 litre. This facilitated a zero extraction (400 ml\nvolume) to determine the start concentration, and\nthen a later second extraction (again 400 ml by vol-\nume) to ascertain the time-dependent value. Open\n(500 ml glass Erlenmeyers with 50 mm polyurethane\nfoam stoppers, both supplied by Fisher Scientific)\nand closed (500 ml screwtop bottles, Fisher Sci-\nentific) bottles were used to expose bacteria to\nvarying oxidative states. Treatments (Table 1) con-\ntained, by volume, 80% unsterilised groundwa-\nter and 10% bacterial inoculum (cultured indige-\nnous groundwater bacteria in response to the Glu-\nMMSL media or Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP). The\nremaining 10% by volume contained the atrazine\nMilliQ water spiking solution (1.5 ml at 10 mg litre\u22121)\nand either the liquid atrazine medium for Pseu-\ndomonas sp. strain ADP treatments20 or autoclaved\nMilliQ water for reference controls. Both treat-\nments subsequently received additions of Glu-MMSL\nmedium at 0 and 23 day intervals; this was sub-\nstituted by MilliQ water in the negative con-\ntrols.\nAtrazine concentration, pH (Hanna H18424 pH\nmeter, Leighton Buzzard, UK), NO3-N and bac-\nterial growth were monitored in triplicate at 0,\n23, 63, 83 and 103 day intervals in both of\nthe two sacrificial batch samples per monitoring\npoint. Bacterial growth was monitored on a Jenway\n6505 UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer in 1.5 ml plastic\ncuvettes from Fisher Scientific. NO3-N analysis was\ncompleted using the Hach nitrate, high-range test (N\ntube, 0\u201330.0 mg litre\u22121 NO3-N, chromotrophic acid\nmethod 10020 for water and wastewater; Hach Lange\nLtd, Salford, UK).\n2.6 Sample preparation for atrazine analysis\nDirect HPLC analysis of atrazine batch concentra-\ntions >1 mg litre\u22121 was achieved after centrifugation\n(15 min at 13 400 \u00d7 g; MSE Micro Centaur, Sanyo)\non 1.5 ml samples. For atrazine batch concentrations\n<1 mg litre\u22121, solid phase extraction (SPE) was used to\npre-concentrate samples prior to HPLC analysis. Sam-\nple clean-up was by filtration (70 mm GF 52 glass fibre\nfilters, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), with\nthe exception of the 83 and 103 day sample intervals\nwhere centrifugation was used (10 310 \u00d7 g for 15 min\nusing a Hettich Rotanta 96 R centrifuge; Global Med-\nical Instrumentation Inc., Albertsville, MN, USA) to\nachieve a greater degree of clean-up in response to\nelevated bacterial growth.\nSPE concentration was conducted using Phe-\nnomenex Strata-X 60 mg\/3 ml cartridges in a Phe-\nnomenex 12-position vacuum manifold (Phenomenex,\nMacclesfield, UK). The Strata-X cartridges were con-\nditioned using 3 ml of methanol, equilibrated using\n3 ml of water and loaded at 4 ml min\u22121 under a vac-\nuum pressure of 15 mmHg using a 400 ml sample.\nAfter sample loading, cartridges were washed with\n1 ml of MilliQ water, dried for 5 min and subsequently\neluted with 2 \u00d7 1 ml of acetonitrile into a 2 ml volumet-\nric flask to check elution volume, before completing\nHPLC analysis.\n2.7 SPE extraction efficiency\nDirect analysis of six individual samples of the filtered\n10 mg litre\u22121 atrazine MilliQ water solution indicated\nthat it had a concentration of 7.66 \u00b1 0.1 mg litre\u22121.\nThis solution when diluted at 1.5 ml litre\u22121 in\nbatch fluid gave a calculated concentration of\n11.50 \u00b5g litre\u22121. The average zero concentration for all\nbatches created (totalling 50 for both treatments and\ncontrols), after allowing for the SPE concentration step\nTable 1.

The extraction\nefficiency of the SPE system was calculated to be\n93.98% and results have been corrected for this\nefficiency.\nIdeally, atrazine spiking solutions would have been\nprepared and spiked in a solvent such as methanol.\nHowever, owing to the relative insolubility of atrazine\nin pure water (70 mg litre\u22121), this could not be\ndone, as it would have introduced more methanol-\nbased carbon into the batch systems than the trace\nconcentrations of glucose-based carbon being tested.\nThe resulting bacterial community would have been\ninduced more in response to methanol, rather than\nglucose, metabolism.\n2.8 Analysis for atrazine content\nDetection and calibration of atrazine between 1 and\n50 mg litre\u22121 were carried out on a Shimadzu class\nVP HPLC with a UV detection system (Shimadzu\nDeutschland GmbH, Duisburg, Germany). The limit\nof detection of this system was 0.1 mg litre\u22121. A\nPhenomenex security guard cartridge holder was used\nin conjunction with a C8 (octyl, MOS) 4 mm \u00d7\n3.0 mm i.d. guard cartridge placed in line before\na Phenomenex Luna 5\u00b5 C8(2) 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm\ncolumn. The solvent system was acetonitrile + MilliQ\nwater (40 + 60 by volume) pumped at a flow rate\nof 1 ml min\u22121. This corresponded to an atrazine\nretention time of \u223c7.8 min on 15 min sample runs\ndetermined at a wavelength of 210 nm.\nFor atrazine concentrations >1 mg litre\u22121 as used\nin monitoring Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP inocula,\nduplicate samples were taken per monitoring point,\nwith triplicate HPLC analysis per sample. Error\ndeviations presented in the results are based on six\nanalyses of two samples per monitoring point, and data\nare presented for the two 1 litre batches separately.\nFor spiked atrazine concentrations <1 mg litre\u22121,\nSPE pre-concentrated these samples to concentrations\n>1 mg litre\u22121, and analysis was performed in triplicate\nbut on one extracted sample per batch. Results from\nthese three analyses were averaged. Error deviations\nare not given for control flasks, which were not\nreplicated, but they are given for the treatment batches.\n3 RESULTS\nThe correlation of growth and atrazine degradation\nby Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP on liquid atrazine\nmedium under sterile conditions, before inoculation\ninto the batch trials, is presented in Fig. 1. Initially,\nOD readings decreased during a 140 h lag period as\nunderlying bacterial growth used media constituents.\nAfter this period, OD measurements were dominated\nby the exponential growth of bacterial biomass,\noccurring concomitantly with the degradation of\natrazine. Growth of Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP\nin batch culture reached a stationary phase after\napproximately 233 h, giving OD measurements of\napproximately 0.300 and 0.260 for batches 1 and\n2 respectively.\nAtrazine degradation rates averaged 13.4 mg litre\u22121\nday\u22121, compared with 100 mg litre\u22121 of [14C]atrazine\nin 25 h reported previously.20 Clearly, the Pseudomonas\nsp. strain ADP used within these experiments was\nnot degrading atrazine optimally in comparison with\nprevious findings. In our experiments this culture\nwas grown at 16 \u25e6C, compared with 30 \u25e6C used by\nMandelbaum et al.,20 and this probably caused the\ndifference.\nGlu-MMSL and Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP\ngroundwater inocula were subsequently used to start\nthe sacrificial batch trials (Figs 2(a) and 2(b)).

OD-monitored growth\noccurred throughout the Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP\ninoculated groundwater over the 100 day period\n(Figs 2(a) and 2(b)) owing to the use of liquid atrazine\nmedium.20 Comparatively, in the groundwater Glu-\nMMSL test case, OD-monitored growth declined after\n83 days, most probably owing to complete metabolism\nof glucose having occurred.\nDifferent oxidative conditions were generated using\nboth open and closed batches, but these showed no\nmarked difference in growth throughout, irrespec-\ntive of treatment. These data can be understood by\nlooking at the available NO3-N concentration data\n(Fig. 3). Zero nitrate concentrations in all batches\nwere as expected when compared with the orig-\ninal analysis of the groundwater NO3-N content\n(15.90 mg litre\u22121 NO3-N). As groundwater only com-\nprised 80% of total batch volume, inevitably there is\nless in the groundwater Glu-MMSL cultured batches,\nespecially compared with the elevated starting value in\nthe Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP batch flasks. This is\nperhaps due to the liquid atrazine medium20 contain-\ning Co(NO3)2\u00b76H2O as a trace salt.\nIn all treatments and oxidative conditions a notable\nreduction in NO3-N content was observed to occur\nbetween the 0 and 23 day monitoring points. Within\nthe Glu-MMSL cultured treatments, removal of NO3-\nN was >90% in all cases, although there were\noccasional residual NO3-N concentrations present\nin some batches.

Such high denitrification efficiencies\nhave been reported previously in the context of the use\nof Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP.22,23\nThese results for NO3-N content indicate that\ndenitrification occurred within all batches, irrespective\nof open or closed bottle conditions. This would not\nnormally be expected from an open batch system,\nbut was probably due to a gradient in oxidative\nconditions ensuring anaerobic conditions at the base\nof the batches.\nHaving established by OD monitoring and denitri-\nfication that bacterial growth occurred in these flasks,\nthe effects on atrazine concentration are shown in\nFigs 4(a) and 4(b) respectively for open and closed\nsacrificial batches. Data are presented both for the\ntime duration batches together with the relevant zero\nvalues.\nThese data for atrazine concentrations are treated\nqualitatively, as in all cases there was no degrada-\ntion. A step change in atrazine concentration would\nprovide evidence of positive degradation, but no\nobvious changes were encountered in either the con-\ntrols, groundwater or Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP\ninoculated flasks under either open or closed bottle\nconditions. In the case of the Glu-MMSL cultured\nbacteria this agrees with similar findings cited in the\nliterature.17,18\n4 DISCUSSION\nUse of SPE coupled with HPLC is perhaps less\nthan ideal for these analyses, and either GC\/MS or\nLC\/MS would be more sensitive. At best, the methods\nused here should detect changes in concentration of\n10 \u00b5g litre\u22121 or more, and this should be sufficient\nto detect a positive change in atrazine concentration\nassociated with degradation caused by bacteria.\nIn inoculated batches, Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP\ndegraded atrazine slowly at a tenth of the cited rate.20\nWhether a 16 \u25e6C incubation temperature accounts\nfor this reduction in degradation is unclear, but, as\nthe inoculum was used in an impure culture, the\nunsterilised groundwater matrix in conjunction with a\nhigh nutrient pressure (liquid atrazine medium20) may\nhave produced conditions under which Pseudomonas\nsp. strain ADP could not compete successfully.\nA similar observation has been reported within\nfluidised bed reactors,22 where the loss of atrazine\ndegradation activity by Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP\nwas due to contamination by other denitrifying bacte-\nria that were unable to degrade atrazine. It is therefore\nunclear how effective bacteria are in degrading trace\nlevels of their associated pollutant. In the environ-\nment, positive degrading bacteria are notably found\nat sites that feature high concentrations of their asso-\nciated pollutant, and have been isolated and grown\nunder laboratory conditions in the presence of high\npollutant concentrations.20,21 Given the use of a pure\nculture of a positive degrading bacterium in sterile lab-\noratory conditions, degradation of the pollutant would\nbe expected to reach a zero value if monitored using\nequipment sensitive enough for the purpose. How-\never, whether bacteria can sustain these adaptations\nin the environment under low pollutant concentra-\ntions and microbial competition is not self-evident,\nand has been suggested by these data and in other\npapers.13\nUnder environmental conditions, positive degraders\nmay not necessarily degrade their target pollutant\nwhen exposed to trace concentrations (<10 \u00b5g litre\u22121),\nfavouring instead use of alternative and more readily\navailable carbon or nitrogen sources. For instance,\nPseudomonas sp. strain ADP does not use atrazine as\neither a carbon or energy source, but as a nitrogen\nsource.12\n304 Pest Manag Sci 62:299\u2013306 (2006)\nIn situ degradation of atrazine in groundwater\n0\n(a)\n(b)\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n23 63 83 103 23 63 83 103 23 63 83 103\nBatch Duration (Days)\nA\ntr\naz\nin\ne \n(\u00b5g\n l-\n1 )\nCONTROL GW Glu-MMSL GW ADP\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n23 63 83 103 23 63 83 103 23 63 83 103\nBatch Duration (Days)\nA\ntr\naz\nin\ne \n(\u00b5g\n l-\n1 )\nN\nO\n R\nES\nUL\nT\nGW Glu-MMSLCONTROL GW ADP \nFigure 4. Averaged replicate data for atrazine concentration within (a) open and (b) closed bottle sacrificial batches. White bars denote zero\natrazine concentrations per batch, with grey bars denoting time-dependent atrazine concentrations per batch.\nWhere degradation is incomplete, only residual\nconcentrations of pollutants may be encountered.\nInvariably, these levels may be low, as exemplified\nby the case of pesticides in drinking water, yet\nmay still be greater than required for legislative\npurposes (<0.1 \u00b5g litre\u22121). Consequently, positive\ndegrading bacterial strains cannot be presumed\nto completely degrade pollutants, whether they\nare introduced through use in bioaugmentation\nprogrammes or as a result of natural selection\noccurring in situ. Our results for bacteria from\ngroundwater, where atrazine concentrations were\ntypically 0.02\u20130.2 \u00b5g litre\u22121, indicated no degradation\nof the herbicide atrazine when spiked to concentrations\nof 10 \u00b5g litre\u22121. This suggests that the aquifer atrazine\nconcentration may have been insufficient to generate\nan adaptation to positive degrader status within the\nindigenous bacteria.\nThe presence of nitrate within this groundwater,\ncoupled with the use of ammonium chloride in the\nGlu-MMSL media as an additional nitrogen source\nconducive with denitrification, may have provided\nnon-limited nitrogen conditions. It is known that\nPseudomonas sp. strain ADP will degrade atrazine as a\nsole nitrogen source and does not require atrazine\nas either a carbon or energy source.12,20,22 The\nprevailing NO3-N content at this site could therefore\nhave been responsible for no adaptation occurring\nwithin the indigenous bacterial community to degrade\natrazine as nitrogen source, and under laboratory\nconditions a readily available nitrogen source may\nhave stopped these bacteria from undertaking atrazine\ndegradation.\nOverall, our studies indicate that atrazine degra-\ndation does not readily occur at trace levels in\ngroundwater where diffuse atrazine contamination is\nencountered. Consequently, it cannot be assumed that\npesticides that are readily degradable at high concen-\ntrations in soils will automatically be degraded at trace\nlevels in groundwaters.\nPest Manag Sci 62:299\u2013306 (2006) 305\nR Pearson, A Godley, E Cartmell\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Thames Water, Oxon\nItalia SpA, and Jennifer Seffernick and Larry Wackett\nat the University of Minnesota.
