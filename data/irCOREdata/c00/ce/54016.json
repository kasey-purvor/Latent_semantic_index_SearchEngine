The response of primates to \nenrichment devices may be affected by many factors such as species, sex, age, \npersonality and social context. Environmental enrichment is particularly important for \nsocial primates living in unnatural social groupings (i.e. same-sex pairs or singly housed \nanimals), who have very few, or no, benefits from the presence of social companions in \naddition to all the problems related to captivity (e.g. increased inactivity). This study \nanalyses the effects of enrichment devices (i.e. novel objects and foraging tasks) on the \nbehavior of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) female pairs, a species that usually \nlives in family groups. It aims to determine which aspects of an enrichment device are \nmore likely to elicit explorative behaviors, and how aggressive and stress-related \nbehaviors are affected by its presence. Overall, the marmosets explored foraging tasks \nsignificantly longer than novel objects. The type of object, which varied in size, shape \nand aural responsiveness (i.e. they made a noise when the monkey touched them), did \nnot affect the response of the monkeys, but they explored objects that were placed \nhigher in the enclosure more than those placed lower down.Younger monkeys were \nmore attracted to the enrichment devices than the older ones. Finally, stress-related \nbehavior (i.e. scratching) significantly decreased when the monkeys were presented \nwith the objects; aggressive behavior as unaffected. This study supports the importance \nof environmental enrichment for captive primates and shows that in marmosets its \neffectiveness strongly depends upon the height of the device in the enclosure and the \npresence of hidden food. The findings can be explained ifone considers the foraging \n 3\nbehavior of wild common marmosets. Broader applications for the research findings are \nsuggested in relation to enrichment. \n \nKey words: common marmoset, female pairs, environmental enrichment, animal \nwelfare.\n 4\n The concept of boredom in captive animals is difficult to define, but most \nethologists agree that insufficient environmental stimulation can lead to boredom1.  \nBoredom, due to the absence of new and\/or adequate stimuli, is a major problem for \nlaboratory and zoo primates2,3. Enrichment devices, such as novel objects and foraging \ntasks, may improve the psychological well-being of animals as these devices provide \nnew and\/or additional stimuli to the monkeys that may elicit exploration, manipulation, \nand attempts to gain food items from them4-6. As such, presenting animals with \nenrichment devices on a regular basis should become the normal routine in captive \nsettings. \nMany studies on environmental enrichment have focused their attention on \ncommon marmosets (Callithrix jacchus7), which are commonly kept in laboratories and \nzoos. Laboratories often require housing common marmosets in same-sex pairs for \nresearch purposes or practical reasons, but female pairs, as well as male pairs, are an \nunnatural social grouping for this species. Common marmosets usually live in family \nunits composed of a breeding pair, the older offspring, and sometimes a few unrelated \nindividuals, which all participate in rearing the infants8,9. In captivity the \ndominant\/breeding female often suppresses the ovulation of subordinate females by \nreleasing pheromones by means of scent-marking10 (although Ziegler and Sousa11 have \nrecently shown that this suppression may also occur at low rates). Moreover, female-\nfemale aggression is high among captive marmosets12,13. Enriching pairs, or singly \nhoused primates, where social stimulation is restricted is of utmost importance. \nHowever, for enrichment devices to be effective in improving the well-being of captive \nanimals (by increasing explorative behavior and reducing abnormal behaviours), their \npresence should decrease, or at least not adversely affect, the rates of aggression and \nstress-related behavior.  \n 5\n \nDespite the number of studies on environmental enrichment, little is understood \nabout which object properties are most effective in improving common marmoset well-\nbeing. In addition, object properties may interplay with other factors known to affect \nresponses such as sex, social context, personality, and age14-16. This study examines the \neffects of age and object properties in common marmosets housed in an unnatural social \ngroup (i.e. female pairs). Object properties play a major role in determining \nresponsiveness. Objects containing hidden food, and\/or those that are moveable, or \nrespond to the primates in some way (e.g. aurally responsive) elicit more exploration \nthan those that do not 17-21. Moreover, in some arboreal species devices placed higher in \nthe enclosure receive greater attention22,23. Finally, the social environment may affect \nhow the monkeys respond to environmental enrichment, although previous studies on \nthis topic, and on how novelty affects the occurrence of stress-related behaviors, have \ngiven contrasting results. For example, cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) living in \nunnatural social conditions react slowly to novelty and with increased signs of distress \nin comparison to those living in family groups24 whereas the presence of a foraging \nboard elicits a strong response in individually housed rhesus monkeys and it also \nreduces the occurrence of abnormal behaviors25.  \nEnvironmental enrichment may have two alternative effects on common \nmarmoset female pairs. It may help to reduce social tension within the pair (as the \nattention of the monkeys is focused on the devices), and improve the psychological \nwell-being of the monkeys due to an increase in exploratory behaviour. Alternatively, \nthe presence of enrichment devices may have deleterious effects on female pairs due to \nthe unnatural social grouping. If environmental enrichment elicits high rates of \nexplorative behaviorsaggression and stress-related behavior might increase as the \n 6\nmonkeys try to monopolize the objects. This may be particularly true for enrichment \ndevices containing highly palatable food. Indeed, an increase in aggression when new, \nattractive objects are added to an enclosure has been found in some species, and \nespecially when foraging tasks are used4, 26,27. Moreover, Michels28 has recently shown \nthat frequency of aggression over food is higher among captive common marmoset \nfemales than among males. As such, it is important to examine whether the presence of \nenrichment devices (i.e. foraging tasks) increase the occurrence of aggression within \nfemale pairs, and avoid their use if so. Therefore, the aims of this study are to analyze \nhow common marmoset female pairs respond to artificial enrichment devices; how their \nresponse is affected by type of enrichment device (novel objects or foraging tasks), its \nindividual properties (i.e. size, shape, aural responsiveness and height in the enclosure), \nand by the age of the monkeys. Finally, it aims to determine if allo-grooming, \naggressive and stress-related behaviors are affected by the presence of the devices. \n \nMethods \nStudy animals and housing conditions \n The study animals were 32 common marmoset female pairs, housed at the \nMedical Research Council (MRC) Unit, Edinburgh, Scotland, in the upper level of two-\ntier cages approximately 55 cm wide, 95 cm high, 110 cm deep. Common marmoset \nfemales are peacefully kept in pairs at the MRC by housing an older with a younger, \nusually unrelated, monkey. Details of the method of initial pairing, and success rate of \npairing common marmoset females are provided in Majolo et al.29. All the cages were \nfurnished with a nest-box, ample natural branches, and a bottle of water. Temperature \nwas maintained at 22-23\u00b0C and there was a 12 hours light on cycle per day.  Monkeys \nwere fed once a day (approximately at 13.00 hrs) and water was available ad libitum.  \n 7\n \nApparatus \nThree different novel objects were used in this study, chosen for their different \ncharacteristics (e.g. responsiveness) and not for their \u201cnaturalness\u201d. The first enrichment \ndevice (novel object A) consisted of a cup (approximately 12 x 9 x 12 cm) filled with 10 \nsmall plastic test-tubes. The second one (B) consisted of a plastic bottle (approximately \n17 x 9 x 9 cm) with a large hole on its side, filled with ten pieces of cloth. The third one \n(C) consisted of four film cases (approximately 9 x 6 x 9 cm) joined together by means \nof plastic strings, each containing a marble. Objects A and C were aurally responsive \n(i.e. they made a noise when the monkeys touched them). Object B was silent. The same \nnovel objects, this time also containing ten raisins hidden in them, were used as \nforaging tasks in Experiment 1 (see below). The monkeys usually ate raisins twice a \nweek as part of their diet. \n \nProcedure \nThere were two experiments. Experiment 1 was designed to test whether the \nkind of enrichment device (i.e. novel object or foraging task) and relative age of the \nmonkeys influenced the response of the monkeys towards the objects and, whether rates \nof stress-related and aggressive behaviors were affected by environmental enrichment. \nExperiment 2 examined the effect of object location on marmoset behavior. For \nExperiment 1, data were collected by BM on 20 female pairs, using a between subjects \ndesign. Novel objects were presented to ten female pairs, whilst foraging tasks were \npresented to the remaining ten (see Table 1). Each cage was divided into three equal \nparts (i.e. low, middle, and high) and objects located accordingly. Object A was located \nin the center of the floor (low), object B was attached horizontally to the middle of the \n 8\ncage door (middle), and object C was hung from the ceiling by means of a string (high). \nEach object was presented to each pair of monkeys once, on three observation days with \none-day intervalsPresentation order was counterbalanced among the pairs. The mean \nage of the pairs presented with novel objects did not differ to those presented with \nforaging tasks (25.8 \u00b1 2.2 and 23.1 \u00b1 2.1 months \u00b1 SE respectively, F (1,18) = 0.79, \nNS). The mean age of the older monkeys in each pair was 31.3 \u00b1 2.2 months \u00b1 SE, and \n17.6 \u00b1 1.0 months \u00b1 SE for the younger monkeys.  \nAll the data were collected from a hide with a one-way mirror. Observation \nsessions were scheduled after cleaning and before feeding. Data were collected using \nfocal pair sampling30 on check-sheets for 20 minutes. The objects were removed at the \nend of the observation sessions. An additional 10-minutes observation session \nimmediately preceded the presentation of each object in order to have baseline rates of \nallo-grooming, stress-related and aggressive behaviors. Latency to explore (defined as \ntouching, manipulating, or playing with the novel object\/foraging task), time spent \nexploring, and latency to eat the first food item contained in the foraging tasks were \nused as measures of the responsiveness of the monkeys towards the enrichment devices. \nAggressive behavior (such as frown, tufts\/ears flick or forward, arch bristle locomotion, \ntail raised present, cackle, cuff, and bite) and scratching were also recorded. Recent \nstudies have shown that scratching is a reliable measure of stress in common \nmarmosets31,32 as it is in Old World monkeys33,34. Time spent exploring was recorded \nby using instantaneous sampling method (20 seconds intervals) whilst behavioral events \n(i.e. aggression and scratching) were recorded by using all occurrences sampling \nmethod35. Allo-grooming was collected using the one-zero sampling method, with 20 \nseconds intervals, as this behavior was rarely observed and had variable duration36. \n 9\nExperiment 2 was designed to assess whether responsiveness to the enrichment \ndevices was due to the object properties (i.e. size, shape or aural responsiveness) or to \nits location in the enclosure. The same three novel objects used in the first part of the \nstudy were presented to 12 different female pairs (see Table 2). Monkeys were divided \nin three groups and each group was presented with the same three objects in different \nlocations. For example, object A was located on the floor of the cage (low) when \npresented to group 1, it was attached to the cage door (middle) when presented to group \n2, and it was hung from the ceiling (high) when presented to group 3. The same \nprocedure was used for objects B and C. Presentation order was counterbalanced among \nthe pairs. Data were collected by JB, using the same methodology as in Experiment 1, \nexcept observation sessions were restricted to 10 minutes as most activity occurs \nimmediately upon presentation of objects.The mean age of the female pairs in the three \ngroups did not differ significantly (group 1 = 17.9 \u00b1 3.6, group 2 = 18.5 \u00b1 2.3, group 3 = \n19.8 \u00b1 2.6 months \u00b1 SE; ANOVA: F(2,9) = 0.17, NS), nor was the mean age of the five \ngroups used in the two experiments significantly different (ANOVA: F(4,27) = 1.71, \nNS). \n \nData analysis \nThe mean scores per hour of each pair were used in the data analysis, except \nwhen a comparison was made between the behavior of older and younger monkeys \nwithin each pair and when scratching was analyzed at the individual level. Data were \nanalyzed using a series of mixed-design ANOVAs and repeated-measures ANOVAs. \nThe between subjects factor was enrichment type (novel object or foraging task), and \nthe within subjects factors were object (A, B or C), height (high, middle, low), time \n(before and during object presentation) and relative age (older or younger in pair). \n 10\nTukey post-hoc tests were run when a significant result was found37. Only significant \ninteractions are presented. Presentation order was considered in the data analysis to \nassess whether habituation towards the objects was a factor that affected the response of \nthe monkeys, but as no significant result was found these data are not presented for the \nsake of brevity. A Pearson correlation was run to relate the baseline level of scratching \n(i.e. frequency before the presentation of the objects) and its variation (i.e. baseline level \nminus frequency of scratching during the presentation of enrichment devices). All the \ntests were two-tailed and significance was set at p < 0.05. \n \nResults \nA 2 x 3 way ANOVA with enrichment type and object as factors showed that \nthe latency to explore the foraging tasks was significantly shorter (F(1,18) = 16.73, P < \n0.01) and time spent exploring them significantly longer than the novel objects F(1,18) \n= 5.16, p < 0.05). The response of the monkeys to the three enrichment devices varied \nsignificantly in relation to kind of object (latency to explore: F(2,36) = 19.96, P < 0.01, \ntime spent exploring: F(2,36) = 21.60, P < 0.01; see Fig 1a, b). Post-hoc tests showed \nthat latency to explore objects B and C (i.e. middle and high in the enclosure, \nrespectively) was significantly shorter than object A (i.e. low, P < 0.01). Moreover, \nmonkeys explored both objects B and C for longer than A (P < 0.01). No significant \ndifference was found between objects B and C. \n These results show that the monkeys interacted significantly more with the \nforaging tasks than with the novel objects. They also suggest that other factors such as \nobject properties or height in the enclosure affect the responses towards the enrichment \ndevices, as the monkeys responded to them differentially. However, the experimental \ndesign did not allow assessment of the relative importance of these factors as each \n 11\nobject was presented in the same position. Experiment 2 was thus designed to determine \nwhich factor (i.e. object kind or its height in the enclosure) was primarily responsible \nfor differences in marmoset responsiveness. \nTo this end, two series of repeated-measures ANOVAs were run for Experiment \n2. In the first one, data were divided by object (i.e. A, B and C) regardless their height \nin the enclosure. Neither latency to explore nor time spent exploring the objects differed \nsignificantly in relation to object (latency to explore: F(2,22) = 0.32, NS, time spent \nexploring: F(2,22) = 2.00, NS; see Figure 2a, b). Then, data were divided according to \nthe height of the object in the enclosure (i.e. low, middle and high), collapsing data \nacross the three objects. Object height affected the latency to explore (F(2,22) = 25.84, \nP < 0.01) and time spent exploring (F(2,22) = 13.19, P < 0.01; see Figure 3a, b). Post \nhoc tests showed that the monkeys explored the objects that were placed high or in the \nmiddle of the cage more quickly than those placed low in the enclosure (P < 0.01). \nMoreover, the monkeys spent more time exploring the objects when they were placed in \nthe middle or high in the enclosure than when placed low (P < 0.01). There was no \nsignificant difference in the latency to explore and time spent exploring between objects \nplaced in the middle and high in the cage.  \n \nThe effect of relative age \nTo test whether the response towards the enrichment devices varied between \nolder and younger members of the pairs a series of repeated-measures ANOVAs were \nrun. Data from Experiment 1 for the three novel objects\/foraging tasks were pooled \ntogether. Latency to explore did not significantly differ between older and younger \nmonkeys (older monkeys: 371.4 \u00b1 65.2 mean seconds \u00b1 SE, younger monkeys: 368.2 \u00b1 \n68.9 mean seconds \u00b1 SE; F(1,19) = 0.00, NS). However, younger monkeys explored the \n 12\nobjects for longer than the older ones (older monkeys: 0.12 \u00b1 0.02 mean \u00b1 SE, younger \nmonkeys: 0.19 \u00b1 0.02 mean \u00b1 SE; F (1,19) = 14.44, P < 0.01). Finally, no significant \ndifference was found for latency to eat between older and younger monkeys within each \npair (mean older monkeys: 474.11 \u00b1 94.03 seconds \u00b1 SE; mean younger monkeys: \n418.87 \u00b1 103.01 seconds \u00b1 SE; F (1,9) = 0. 48, NS). \n \nThe effect of environmental enrichment on allo-grooming, aggressive and \nstress-related behaviors \nAllo-grooming was never performed by female pairs whilst they were presented \nwith the enrichment devices. However, this behavior was also rarely observed when the \nobjects were absent (0.47 \u00b1 0.19 mean percentage of sample bouts \u00b1 SE).  \nAs the marmosets spent a considerable proportion of their time exploring the \nenrichment devices, one might expect them to fight in order to monopolize the objects, \nthis effect being stronger in female pairs presented with foraging tasks. To this end, the \nfrequency of aggression and scratching before and during the presentation of the \nenrichment devices was analyzed.  Scratching is a reliable measure of stress in common \nmarmosets (see Methods section. Two 2 x 2 mixed-design ANOVAs were run using \nenrichment type and time as factors. Data were collapsed across the three novel \nobjects\/foraging tasks. \nNo significant difference was found in rates of aggressive behaviors before and \nduring the presentation of enrichment devices (F(1,18) = 4.53, NS, see Figure 4), nor \nwas it affected by enrichment type(F(1,18) = 0.99, NS). The rate of scratching was \nsignificantly lower during object presentation than before it (F(1,18) = 20.26 P <0.01, \nFigure 4) and this decrease was stable throughout the 20 minute observation sessions. \nNo significant difference was observed between female pairs presented with foraging \n 13\ntasks and those presented with novel objects (F(1,18) = 1.26, NS), but a significant \ninteraction was found (F(1,18) = 14.64, P < 0.01). The decrease in scratching was \ngreater for foraging tasks, than for novel objects. Finally, a significant positive \ncorrelation was found between the baseline level of scratching and the reduction in the \noccurrence of this behavior during the presentation of the enrichment devices (rs = 0.87, \nN = 40, P < 0.001). \n \nDiscussion \nAll the monkeys explored the enrichment devices but the foraging tasks were \nexplored earlier and for longer than the novel objects were. The shorter latency to \nexplore the foraging tasks suggests that the monkeys could smell the food hidden in the \nobjects as soon as they approached them. Clearly, the presence of desired food in the \nforaging tasks accounts for the significant difference observed between foraging tasks \nand novel objects in time spent exploring, as this was the only factor that differed \nbetween them. Other studies have also shown that foraging tasks elicit the strongest \nresponses in marmosets and tamarins18,38. As such, the foraging tasks are a more \neffective means of environmental enrichment than the novel objects in the short term for \ncommon marmosets. However, the intensive use of foraging tasks containing desirable \nfood items (such as raisins in this study), has to be considered carefully, as captive \nanimals are often inactive3. The presence of highly calorific food in their diet may make \nthem fatter, more inactive, and reduce their behavioral repertoire. A solution to this \nproblem may be to present the monkeys with foraging tasks containingfood items from \ntheir daily diet. Data on rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) have shown that this \npractice increased the foraging effort (and thus reduced inactivity), the waste of food \nwas lower than with the control feeder, and the weights of the monkeys did not \n 14\nchange39. It is likely that this practice would have similar positive effects on common \nmarmoset female pairs. Moreover, the objects used in this study were not \u201cnatural\u201d (as, \nfor example, an artificial gum tree is). However, these objects elicited high levels of \ncuriosity in the monkeys and they were easy to get and clean, cheap, and not dangerous \nfor the monkeys. As such, another, potentially complementary approach to the previous \none may be to present the monkeys with two\/three objects each day and to alternate the \npresence, and quantity, of food items unpredictably. This practice should be easy to \nimplement, not time consuming for laboratory staff, and the marmosets would spend a \nlarge amount of timeexploring the objectsto determine whether or not they contain food. \nThis situation is more similar to the natural foraging experiences of wild marmosets and \ncan be easily achieved even with artificial devices.  \nAlthough the three objects used in this study differed from one another in size, \nshapeand aural responsiveness, the monkeys did not show any significant preference for \nany one of them. However, they explored the objects placed higher in the enclosure \nmore than those on the ground indicating that this factor greatly affects its attractiveness \nin common marmosets, as already noted by Millar16. This result is not surprising as, in \nthe wild, common marmosets occupy the lower strata of the canopy and rarely goto the \nground presence of potential predators40. Therefore, exploring stimuli located in the \nupper part of the enclosure is a situation that resembles what wild common marmosets \nexperience whilst foraging. However, placement of enrichment devices lower in the \nenclosure need not necessarily be rejected, as Reinhardt et al.41 argue that this might \nencourage greater space utilization. This does not appear to be the case in common \nmarmosets which spend the same amount of time in the upper part of their enclosure \nregardless of the height of food dishes42. \n 15\nNeither latency to explore nor latency to eat significantly differed between older \nand younger monkeys. However, younger monkeys explored the enrichment devices for \nsignificantly longer than the older ones. This result indicates that the older monkeys lost \ninterest in the objects significantly earlier than their younger social companions, as \nalready noted in other studies43. \nEnvironmental enrichment is only effective when it not only decreases boredom \nbut it also does not adversely affect rates of aggressive and stress-related behaviors. In \nthis study, rates of aggressive behaviors were unaffected by the presence of the \nenrichment devices and scratching significantly decreased in their presence. Scratching \nand exploration are not mutually exclusive categories.The reduction in the occurrence of \nscratching was significantly greater in female pairs presented with foraging tasks than \nwith novel objects, but this may be due to the higher baseline level of scratching in \nfemales pairs presented with foraging tasks (Figure 5). However, although not \nconclusive, these data suggest that the presence of the enrichment devices may be \nbeneficial for the psychological well-being of captive common marmosets, especially \nfor monkeys with high baseline levels of stress.  \nOverall, these results support the importance of environmental enrichment for \nthe psychological well-being of captive primates3. In particular, they are important as \nhousing common marmoset females in same-sex pairs is an unnatural social grouping \nfor this species, and the positive benefits of a social companion appear to be limited. \nAggression among captive female marmosets is frequent (Introduction) and moreover \nfemale pairsexchange affiliative behaviors (i.e. allo-grooming) at extremely low rates. \nTherefore, enrichment devices may be extremely important for common marmoset \nfemale pairs (and probably for other captive primates living in similar unnatural social \ngroupings), even if they are presented for relatively brief periods of time, as they reduce \n 16\nboredom through increases in exploratory behaviour, decrease the occurrence of stress-\nrelated behavior, and do not affect aggression within the pair\n 17\nAcknowledgements \nWe should like to thank Keith Morris, Irene Greig, Kevin Hawes, and Mark \nFisken of the MRC Unit, for their practical help and kindness throughout the data \ncollection, Gabriele Schino and Raffaella Ventura for valuable comments on the \nmanuscript.
