Our aim in this study was to find whether \nsiskins caught from the wild in Britain and exposed to different photoperiodic regimes, typical \nof widely separated latitudes, would differ in the subsequent timing and duration of their \nmoults and associated processes. Siskins were caught in late February and early March, and \ninitially kept outside on natural photoperiods. From the spring equinox (21 March), they were \ndivided into three groups kept under photoperiodic regimes that simulated latitudes 40\u00ba, 55\u00ba \nand 70\u00ba N respectively. All three groups showed highly significant subsequent changes in \nbody mass, fat scores and cloacal protuberance size. Moult of the primary feathers started \nduring June \u2013 August (mean 9 July), and lasted 61-99 days (mean 75 days). Birds that started \nto moult late in the season had shorter moult durations. All individuals showed lower mass \nand fat levels during moult than before or after moult. Crucially, there were no significant \ndifferences in the timing of these events between the three photoperiodic groups. Apparently \nthese birds did not use prevailing absolute photoperiod or the prevailing rate of change in \nphotoperiod to time moult-related seasonal events, but used instead some other feature of the \nannual photoperiod cycle or some form of interval timer linked to photoperiod. \n \nKeywords: body weight, brood patch, Carduelis spinus, cloacal protuberance, fat score, \nmoult, photoperiod, siskin  \n \n 3 \n  \nMany species of birds have breeding ranges which span a wide range of latitudes. Within such \nspecies, breeding typically begins later in the year at higher latitudes and in some it extends \nover a shorter period. In species which moult in their breeding areas, this process is also \nspread over a shorter period at higher latitudes (Berthold 1993). Since the timing of breeding \nand moult are controlled by photoperiod (Dawson et al. 2001), either directly or by entraining \nan endogenous circannual rhythm (Gwinner 1986), it is unclear how the timing of seasonal \nevents relates to the different patterns of change in photoperiod at different latitudes.  \n \nAt higher latitudes, photoperiod is longer at the summer solstice and shorter at the winter \nsolstice, and consequently the rate of change in photoperiod is greater at all times of year than \nat lower latitudes (excepting the summer period at high latitudes under continuous daylight). \nMoreover, the differences in photoperiod per degree of latitude increase as latitude increases. \nFor example, at 10\u00b0N the photoperiod at the summer solstice is less than 30 min greater than \nat 0\u00b0N, whereas at 70\u00b0N it is 5 hours longer than at 60\u00b0N (and see Fig. 1). Birds at the north \nand south of the breeding range will therefore experience very different changes in \nphotoperiod during those parts of the year when they are in their breeding areas, and this is \nparticularly true for species breeding at high latitudes. \n \nRowan (1925) first demonstrated that an increase in photoperiod during winter caused \ngonadal maturation. Later studies showed that when birds were transferred from a short \nphotoperiod to a longer photoperiod, the rate of gonadal maturation was proportional to the \nlength of the longer photoperiod (Farner and Wilson, 1957; Farner et al. 1966), and the time \nto the onset of gonadal regression and post-nuptial moult was inversely proportional to \nphotoperiod (Dawson and Goldsmith 1983). Given these markedly different responses to \n 4 \ndifferent photoperiods, it is unclear how birds at different latitudes use photoperiod to time \nseasonal events. \n \nMost bird species show high site fidelity, with young birds breeding in the general region of \ntheir birth, and adults returning each year to the same areas (Newton 2008). In this situation, \nbirds could become genetically adapted to respond appropriately to the cycle in photoperiod \nat their natal latitude. Silverin et al. (1993) exposed great tits Parus major caught at different \nlatitudes to the same experimental changes in photoperiod. Birds from Italy responded to a \nshorter photoperiod than birds from southern Sweden, providing support for this hypothesis. \nHowever, there was no difference between the birds from southern Sweden and others from \nnorthern Norway, even though they were from equally different latitudes. Helm et al. (2009) \nexposed two closely related subspecies of stonechats Saxicola torquata maurus and S. t. \ntorquata, which naturally breed at similar latitudes, to the same annual cycle in photoperiod. \nTheir responses differed, and corresponded to their different natural schedules.  \n \nOther bird species, for example some cardueline finches, can breed in widely separated areas \nin different years, according to prevailing food-supplies (Newton 2008). In some such \nspecies, food supply may play a role in fine-tuning the date of breeding (Hahn et al. 2005). \nNevertheless, all such species are thought to be photoperiodic (Hahn 1998). Different species \nrespond differently to the same experimental artificial photoperiods (Hahn et. al., 2004) and \nhave slightly different mechanisms by which photoperiod brings breeding to an end, to suit \nthe unpredictability of their food supplies. When pine siskins Carduelis pinus, common \nredpolls Carduelis flammea and white-winged crossbills Loxia leucoptera were kept on \nconstant short photoperiods for 4.5 months from the middle of winter, only pine siskins \nshowed significant gonadal development suggesting that siskins may not be highly dependent \n 5 \non increasing photoperiods to induce sexual maturation. In birds transferred to constant long \nphotoperiods in winter, gonadal maturation occurred in all three species. After 4.5 months on \nlong photoperiods, gonadal regression was complete in redpolls and pine siskins, but only \npartial in crossbills. Feather moult was most advanced in redpolls, slightly less advanced in \npine siskins and least advanced in crossbills. This demonstrates that the reproductive systems \nof all three species is stimulated by long photoperiods, but that crossbills, which are temporal \nopportunists, either do not show spontaneous gonadal regression (i.e. absolute \nphotorefractoriness) or developed photorefractoriness more slowly. Body mass and fat depots \nof pine siskins, unlike the other two species, remained high irrespective of photoperiod. The \ndifferent photoperiodic responses of these species appear to result from differences in their \nreproductive neuroendocrinology (Hahn et al. 2008).  \n \nSuch studies can explain how different species respond differently to the same annual cycles \nin photoperiod to suit their species-specific ecologies, but how is photoperiod used by \nindividuals of the same species to time seasonal events when the individuals may be at very \ndifferent latitudes in different years? One possibility is that birds use photoperiod to entrain an \nendogenous circannual rhythm in reproductive function and moult, but it is unclear how this \ncould operate at different latitudes because such rhythms in reproductive function are usually \nexpressed only under a narrow range of permissive photoperiods (Gwinner and Wozniak \n1982, Gwinner 1986, Wikelski et al. 2008). This holds for tropical and for non-tropical \nspecies, such as common starling Sturnus vulgaris (Gwinner 1996). Another possibility is that \nbirds do not use absolute photoperiod, or even the rate of change in photoperiod. Rather, they \nmay use more subtle information on how photoperiod is changing to indicate calendar date. \nEvidence for this came from a study in which Starlings were held for three years on a \nphotoperiodic regime simulating either 9\u00b0N or 52\u00b0N. Gonadal maturation started slightly \n 6 \nearlier at the lower latitude, but regression and moult occurred at exactly the same date \n(Dawson 2007). \n \nIn this paper, we describe an experiment using a cardueline finch \u2500 the Eurasian siskin \nCarduelis spinus. This species is a seed-eater, specialising on the annually variable seed-crops \nof certain trees, notably Norway spruce Picea abies in the early breeding season. Although \nmigratory, it concentrates in different areas in different years, depending on where good seed-\ncrops are available. Numbers in particular areas fluctuate greatly from year to year, in line \nwith seed abundance, and ringing has confirmed that individual siskins can breed and winter \nin widely separated areas in different years. Ringed birds have been found in localities up to \nseveral hundred kilometres apart in different breeding seasons and at localities up to several \nthousand kilometres apart in different winters (Newton 2008). Restricted to breeding in \nconiferous areas, the species has a wide geographical range, extending in some years \nnorthward to the tree limit beyond 70\u00baN and southward into montane forests beyond 40\u00baN. \nThere is no evidence to suggest that individuals could move to breed successfully over the \nwhole of this wide latitudinal span, but, along with some other tree-seed specialists, siskins \nclearly show less site fidelity than most other bird species (Newton 2008). Through their \nmigrations, individuals can also winter at localities separated by more than 30\u00ba of latitude in \ndifferent years, so are exposed to different photoperiodic regimes from year to year as they \nprepare for spring migration and breeding.  \n \nIn this study, siskins were caught from the wild during spring. There is no information on the \ntiming of gonadal maturation in this species, but in closely related greenfinches, Carduelis \nchloris, testicular maturation starts during winter and by the equinox the testes are nearly fully \nmature (Dawson unpublished data). Our specific aim in this study was therefore to find \n 7 \nwhether siskins caught from the wild and exposed, from the spring equinox, to the different \nphotoperiodic regimes typical of widely separated breeding latitudes differ in the subsequent \ntiming and duration of their moults and other processes associated with the end of breeding \nand gonadal regression.  \n \nMethods \nSiskins were caught from the wild during late February and early March 2008 in two \nlocalities in Britain, namely Langholm in Dumfriesshire (lat. 55\u00ba 10\u2019N) and Kings Lynn in \nNorfolk (lat. 52\u00ba 45\u2019N). The species breeds in both areas, but in winter local numbers are \ngreatly swollen by immigration of winter visitors from further north in Britain and continental \nEurope, with ring recoveries from as far east as Russia. No subspecific or clinal variation is \nevident in siskins, and none of our birds had been previously ringed, so their natal areas were \nunknown. However, each individual was ringed on capture to facilitate future identification, \nand sexed and aged (as first year or older) using criteria described in Svensson (1992). Only \nbirds in their first year of life (hatched in the previous calendar year) were kept for \nexperiment. They were fed throughout on a commercial seed mixture, which was made \ncontinuously available in several dishes to minimise potential competition between \nindividuals. Birds were initially held in an outdoor aviary at 52\u00b0N. At the spring equinox (21 \nMarch), the birds were separated into three treatment groups and housed as free-flying birds \nin separate rooms, each with a photoperiod of 12 h light per day. Thereafter, photoperiod was \nchanged each day to simulate changes at 40\u00baN, 55\u00baN and 70\u00baN respectively (Fig. 1), as \ncalculated from the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S Naval Observatory \n(http:\/\/aa.usno.navy.mil\/). Hence, for the 40\u00ba group, photoperiod was increased progressively \nto 15 h on 21 June (the summer solstice) and then decreased appropriately to 9.3 h by 21 \nDecember (the winter solstice). For the 55\u00baN group, photoperiod was increased to 17.4 h on \n 8 \n21 June and then decreased to 7.2 h on 21 December. For the 70\u00ba group, photoperiod was \nincreased to 24 h by 16 May, held constant at 24 h until 26 July, and then reduced to 4 h light \non 14 November. Photoperiod was not allowed to fall below 4 h (normally the birds would \nhave left such high latitudes by then).  \n \nDuring the study all the birds were examined individually at frequent intervals (weekly \nintervals from the end of June) for body mass and fat score, condition of cloaca (males) or \nbrood patch (females), and state of moult. Body masses were taken to the nearest 0.1 g, fat \nscores in the tracheal pit were recorded as 0 - 4 (0 - no fat, 1- slight fat, 2 - some fat, 3 - level \nwith edges, or 4 - extending out from the tracheal pit over the pectoral muscles). Reproductive \ncondition was assessed from the size (height (mm) x width (mm) = size) of the cloacal \nprotuberance in males, or from the presence or absence of a brood patch in females (brood \npatches became de-feathered even though the birds had no opportunity to build a nest). Moult \nwas recorded from the lengths (mm) of the growing primary and secondary feathers in the \nright wing (for the most part both wings moulted in step with one another). As is usual in \nmost passerines, the primaries were shed in sequence from 1-9 (innermost to outermost), and \nthe secondaries from 1-6 (outermost to innermost). Following the usual convention, the \nduration of moult was calculated as the period between the shedding of the first (innermost) \nprimary feather and the completion of growth of the last (outermost) primary. Most other \nfeathers were replaced within this period, but at the end of primary moult some birds were \nstill growing one or two secondary feathers in each wing. Successive measurements from the \nsame feathers enabled their growth rates to be calculated, from which the start and end dates \nof primary moult could be estimated precisely, even though the birds were examined at \napproximate weekly intervals. Growth rates of equivalent feathers were effectively the same \nin all individuals: the first (innermost) primary grew at 2.4 mm per day, the ninth (outermost) \n 9 \nprimary at 2.7 mm per day, and the sixth secondary at 2.5 mm per day. These rates were used \nfor calculating the start and end dates of primary moult, and the end date of secondary moult \n(for those birds in which secondary moult ended after primary moult). \n \nStatistical analyses \nThe number of males present in the three groups, 70\u00baN, 55\u00baN and 40\u00baN, at the start of the \nstudy and the start of moult was 10, 11 and 10 respectively. An additional 5 females were \nincluded with the 55\u00baN group. The study ended on 21 December, when, due to mortality, \nsample sizes for males had decreased to 8, 9 and 8 respectively. Body mass, fat score, and \ncloacal size were analysed using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures (latitude and date) \nusing GraphPad Prism (2007). Moult data were analysed with single factor ANOVA \n(latitude). Due to arrested moult in some individuals, moult end dates and duration were \ncalculated from 5, 6 and 8 birds respectively.  \n \n \nResults \nBody mass and fat score \nAll three groups, kept on photoperiodic regimes of 40\u00ba, 55\u00ba and 70\u00baN, showed significant but \nparallel changes in body mass and fat scores with date (Table 1, Fig. 2). In general, mass and \nfat scores were high on 6 May, having increased substantially from their levels at capture. \nThis may have reflected pre-migratory fat deposition (normally preceding spring migration) \nbut was possibly a consequence of captivity and the availability of excess food. In the absence \nof migration, mass and fat scores of our birds remained high through the breeding season, but \nstarted to decline in advance of the start of moult and reached lowest values towards the end \nof moult. Thereafter values increased again. These increases could again be attributed to pre-\n 10 \nmigratory fat deposition (normally preceding autumn migration). Body mass and fat scores \nchanged in parallel in the three groups, with similar trends through the season. Latitude had \nno significant effect on either body mass or fat scores (Table 1). No interaction between date \nand latitude was evident for body mass, but it was for fat scores which decreased somewhat \nless during moult and increased to greater values in the 70\u00ba group during autumn. \n \nCloacal size \nAll three groups showed significant changes in cloacal protuberance with date (Table 1, Fig. \n2). No males showed any sign of a cloacal protuberance when they were caught in \nFebruary\/March, but all had well developed protuberances when they were next handled on 6 \nMay. Sizes varied from 4x1 mm to 5x2 mm. By 6 June, cloacal protuberances had enlarged \nfurther in some birds, reaching up to 6x3 mm. During the rest of the breeding season, cloacal \nsizes fluctuated within this range in the same individuals. Scores remained high through the \nbreeding season, and declined during moult. Individuals showed considerable variation in the \nstage of moult at which the cloacal region appeared flat again, but all had low scores before \nthe end of moult. There was no effect of latitude on cloacal size, and no interaction between \ndate and latitude (Table 1). The five females examined followed similar patterns to males in \ntheir body mass and fat levels: their brood patches became de-feathered during May, and re-\nfeathered during the course of moult, as new feathers grew.  \n \nMoult in the three treatment groups \nNo significant differences in either start dates, end dates or durations of moult emerged \nbetween the three treatment groups (Table 1, Fig. 3). The overall mean values for all \ntreatment groups combined were 8.7 July (SE 3.9 days, n = 31) for start dates, 10.9 September \n(SE 3.3 days, n = 20) for end dates, and 74.9 (SE 2.1 days, n = 19) for moult durations. The \n 11 \nfigure for duration (74.9 days) is based only on 19 birds followed to the end of moult, \nwhereas the difference between mean start and mean end dates (with sample sizes of 36 and \n19) was 64.2 days. No birds in the 40\u00baN group showed arrested moult but 3 in each of the \nother groups did.  \n \nIn the overall sample, starting dates varied between 6 June and 26 August, end dates between \n22 August and 16 October, and durations between 61 and 99 days. The greater spread in start \ndates (81 days) than in end dates (55 days) resulted at least in part from late-starting birds \nmoulting more rapidly than early-starting birds. This tendency was reflected in the negative \nrelationship between start date and moult duration in the 19 individuals that were followed \nthrough a complete moult (Fig. 4).  \n \nThe above analyses were based on data from males only (some females were included in one \ngroup) and compared treatments ignoring possible confounding effects of location of capture. \nThe initial analysis was therefore extended to test for effects of each of these factors after \nallowing for effects of the other factors (sex and site of capture). No differences in treatments \nwere apparent in either start dates (p=0.13), end dates (p=0.25) or durations (p=0.48). Males \nshowed an earlier start (p=0.057) and end (p=0.003) than females, but no obvious difference \nin duration (p=0.21). No effects of capture site were evident on any of the moult parameters. \n \nOn each bird, most of the feathers were replaced within the period of primary moult, except \nthat some individuals were still growing one or two secondaries at the time the last primary \nreached full length. The whole moult period of these individuals was thereby extended by up \nto fourteen further days. The remaining individuals that finished primary moult failed to \nreplace all their secondaries, and retained the last one or two (presumably for another year \n 12 \nuntil the next moult). Some adult birds when caught from the wild had also retained one or \ntwo secondaries through their previous moult, so retention of these feathers may not be \nunusual among siskins. In addition, some of the captive birds also retained their outer primary \nfeathers, usually one or two, but up to four in some individuals. For these individuals, moult \nend dates and durations were not calculated. \n \nDiscussion \nBirds are highly photoperiodic (at least those species that breed outside the tropics) and use \nthe annual cycle in photoperiod in some way to time key stages of the annual cycle: gonadal \nmaturation and regression, moult and migration. In this study we kept siskins under three \ndifferent photoperiodic regimes, equivalent to those at 40\u00ba, 55\u00ba and 70\u00baN. Absolute \nphotoperiod would have been different at all times (apart from the equinoxes) between the \nthree groups, as would the rate of change in photoperiod. Body mass, fat scores, and cloacal \nprotuberance sizes all changed significantly over time, but there were no differences between \nthe groups. All three groups started to moult at the same time, and moult duration did not \ndiffer significantly between them. This suggests that the birds did not use prevailing absolute \nphotoperiod or prevailing rate of change in photoperiod to time events during at least this part \nof the annual cycle. This finding is compatible with the earlier study on starlings held for \nthree years on a photoperiodic regime simulating either 9\u00b0N or 52\u00b0N in which gonadal \nmaturation started slightly earlier at the lower latitude, but regression and moult occurred at \nexactly the same dates (Dawson 2007). Some other signal derived from the annual cycle in \nphotoperiod must have been important as an event timer in these birds.  \n \nThere are several potential explanations for these findings. Firstly, birds may have an innate \ncircannual rhythm driven rather than entrained by photoperiod. One problem with this \n 13 \nhypothesis is that circannual rhythms in reproductive function (but not moult or migratory \nfattening) are only fully expressed under a narrow range of permissive photoperiods \n(Wikelski et al. 2008). For example, in the common starling, the \u2018circannual clock\u2019 stops on \nphotoperiods exceeding 13h of light per day (Gwinner and Wozniak 1982); the annual cycle \nin photoperiod over-rides a circannual clock. Secondly, birds may utilise an interval timer. \nPhotoperiod at one or more times of year (possibly the spring equinox) may be used to \nprogramme the timing of subsequent events. In some other seed-eating species, photoperiod \nbefore gonadal maturation can affect the timing of autumnal events (King 1963, Farner et al. \n1980, Moore et al. 1982, Berthold 2002). In the present study, all three groups of siskins were \nheld on the same photoperiodic changes until the spring equinox, so photoperiod prior to the \nequinox may have determined the timing of subsequent changes in physiology. However, in \nthe study on starlings (Dawson 2007), birds were held continuously for three years on the \ndifferent simulated latitudes, and the timing of gonadal regression and moult was exactly the \nsame in all three years. An interval timer, set at some earlier date, is highly unlikely to have \noperated over such a long time period. However, an interval timer operating specifically from \nthe equinox alone could control subsequent timings. Finally, birds may be taking information \nfrom the sinusoidal pattern of change in photoperiod: in other words, not absolute photoperiod \nor even the rate of change in photoperiod, but how the rate of change in photoperiod is \nchanging \u2013 a second order function. Also, although absolute photoperiod and rate of change in \nphotoperiod vary at different latitudes, some features of the annual cycle remain the same at \nall latitudes. Photoperiod is the same at the equinoxes, the rate of change is greatest at the \nequinoxes, and the rate of change is minimal at the solstices. In theory, using such \nphotoperiodic cues, birds could estimate calendar time irrespective of their latitude, although \nthis would necessitate a sophisticated degree of perception and presumably a sufficiently long \nperiod of time resident at a given latitude. If birds were actively migrating, this would \n 14 \ncomplicate perception of calendar time. Helm and Gwinner (2005) exposed groups of \nstonechats S. torquata to different patterns of photoperiod during spring to simulate different \nmigration strategies. This did affect the subsequent timing of testicular regression, moult and \nautumnal migratory restlessness. These three possibilities of control are not necessarily \nmutually exclusive and perhaps elements of all three are involved, and the relative importance \nof each may vary between species to reflect their differing ecologies.  \n \nAnother striking finding from the study was the wide variation in all measured parameters \nwithin groups, whether the timing and duration of moult, the timing of reproductive \nregression and fat deposition with respect to moult, or the amount of fat deposited. Three \npoints are relevant. Firstly, because our siskins were caught from winter flocks, their natal \nareas were unknown, but to judge from previous ringing recoveries, the birds could have been \nhatched further north in Britain, or in a wide area of northern Europe extending from Norway \nto Russia. Different birds could have originated from different areas, accounting for some of \nthe individual variation found in all three experimental groups. Secondly, there is evidence \nfrom the wild that the timing of breeding and migration in siskins can vary from year to year \nin the same region, depending on the abundance of the tree-seeds that form their main foods \n(Sv\u00e4rdson 1957, Newton 2008). However, in captivity, our birds had continuous access to ad \nlib food. Thirdly, in the wild, the timing of breeding is likely to influence the timing of moult \nand subsequent migratory fat deposition. Although our captive birds showed reproductive \ndevelopment, they did not have facilities to breed in captivity and so this is unlikely to have \ncontributed to the variation between individuals. \n \nThere was no significant difference in the duration of moult between the siskins on different \nsimulated latitudes whereas in free-living birds of some other species, moult duration is less at \n 15 \nhigher latitudes (Berthold 1993). This too may result from breeding activity. At higher \nlatitudes breeding tends to start later (Berthold 1993) and so it may also finish later (at least in \nsingle brooded species). Moult is often delayed until breeding has finished (Newton 1966, \nSamson 1976, Morton and Morton 1990, Morton 1992, Hemborg 1999). Therefore, breeding \nbirds at higher latitudes may start to moult later. Birds that start to moult late then moult more \nrapidly (Samson 1976, Morton and Morton 1990), because the rate of moult is influenced by \nthe time that it starts (Dawson 2004). In individual siskins, moult duration decreased in birds \nthat started to moult later (Fig. 4). However, in the absence of breeding activity, there was no \ndifference in mean moult start dates between the simulated latitudes and so there was no \ndifference in mean moult duration. \n \nOne other finding from out study concerns the fat scores which followed a similar pattern in \nall three groups, but were higher during late summer and autumn in the 70\u00ba N birds than in the \n55 and 40\u00ba N birds. This difference may have been a response to the longer nights \nexperienced by the 70\u00ba N birds, during which they had to survive on their body fat.  \n \nAcknowledgements \u2013 We are grateful to Jed Andrews, Sophie Barker and Fred Cooke for help \nin catching siskins, to Tony Turk for looking after the birds in captivity and to Peter Rothery \nfor statistical advice.
