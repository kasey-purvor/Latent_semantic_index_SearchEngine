It is envisaged that\nB3G networking by 2010 will support [1]:\n\u2022 Coexistence and convergence of different\nlegacy (wireless, wired, broadcast, etc.) and\nnew networks, including moving and ad hoc\nnetworks\n\u2022 Evolutionary deployment of secure, extensi-\nble, scalable, reconfigurable, and manage-\nable B3G systems\n\u2022 Independent evolution of network technolo-\ngies and services\n\u2022 Controlled service access by users and\ndevices anywhere anytime by different means\n\u2022 Pervasive and seamless mobile multiparty\nmultimedia communications and access to\nall kinds of services to minimize adverse\nimpact on user experience in the changing\nnetworking environment\n\u2022 Value-added interface to upper-layer appli-\ncations to enable and enhance their loca-\ntion, context, and quality of service (QoS)\nawareness\n\u2022 Interactions with access systems for optimal\nmobility management and better use of\nscarce radio resources\n\u2022 Unrestricted and innovative business models\nThe desire to seamlessly deliver application\nservices across heterogeneous access networks in\na B3G system leads to an obvious conclusion\nthat B3G systems would best be built on IP net-\nworking technologies. However, it is also obvious\nthat existing IP networking technologies do not\nprovide all the necessary features to enable a\nB3G system and must be extended.\nTherefore, it is inappropriate to set a single\nroadmap for technology development to achieve\nthe vision, due to different concerns and priori-\nties with respect to technology maturity, technical\ndifficulties, market requirements, business mod-\nels, and more. There will be different paths pur-\nsued, learning and leveraging from each another.\nThe following are some possible goals B3G\nresearch efforts could aim for to achieve the\nvision outlined above [1]:\n\u2022 A system in which a user can move seam-\nlessly between cellular, wireless, and wired\naccess networks\n\u2022 Interdomain administration and manage-\nment support to allow seamless mobility\nbetween administrative domains\n\u2022 Support of multiparty multimedia (including\nQoS-sensitive) sessions between networks\nand administrative domains\nARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES\nThis section describes architectural principles\nand basic requirements commonly regarded as\nthe cornerstone for studying related technologies\nand designing future IP-based cooperative sys-\ntems. These features mainly include functional\nblocks, multiple services and their creation, con-\nnectivity issues, end-to-end concept, security,\ncontrol, operation and maintenance, and self-\norganization [2].\nIn CoNet, a layered approach is globally sup-\nported. This means that the functionality of the\nsystem is grouped into distinct layers that form\nlogically separate subsystems. Any layered model\nhas at least three layers: application, connectivi-\nty, and access. The application layer can be fur-\nther divided into service application and service\nsupport sublayers. The connectivity layer can be\nfurther divided into network control and trans-\nport (IP) sublayers. And the access layer may\ncontain several independent access networks\nthat can also function simultaneously.\nThe layers should have well defined inter-\nfaces and be functionally independent of each\nother. Such an approach is required to ensure\neasy adaptation of heterogeneous access tech-\nnologies, related technology changes, and flexi-\nble support for rapid service innovation.\nBecause of the need for cross-layer optimiza-\ntion (e.g., for power management, QoS support,\netc), the layered approach in CoNet is consid-\nered as a design principle rather than as a uni-\nversal design pattern, meaning that every B3G\nsystem may potentially have its own layered\narchitecture.\nINDEPENDENT FUNCTIONAL BLOCKS,\nMODULARIZATION, AND REUSE\nThe CoNet architecture should define each func-\ntion as an independent functional block. This\npromotes component-based modular architec-\nture, where different building blocks can be\ncombined as needed to realize complex systems.\nThis in turn requires standardized definition of\nsyntax and semantics of these interfaces. For\ninstance, functionalities required to process and\nroute user data, handle control signaling, and\ndeal with network management can be separated\ninto different functional blocks in the user, con-\ntrol, and management planes, respectively. It\nshould be noted that each layer of the architec-\nture has its own separate set of functions for\neach plane; hence, nine different functional\nblocks can be identified, as shown in Fig. 1.\nRealization of the functionalities as indepen-\ndent building blocks allows the introduction of\nnew functions when needed without changing\nthe whole architecture. The building blocks\nshould be reused, when applicable, with different\naccess technologies and realization of various\n\u0002 Figure 1. Layers and planes.\nAccess layer\nApplication\nlayer\nConnectivity\nlayer\nService application sublayer  \nService support sublayer\nNetwork control sublayer  \nTransport sublayer\nUser\nplane\nControl\nplane\nManagement\nplane\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Therefore, implementing the same or\nvery similar functionality multiple times should\nbe avoided.\nCOOPERATIVE CONNECTIVITY\nThe CoNet architecture should ensure connec-\ntivity between all the entities of a network in a\nconsistent manner across all access technologies\nfor any service. This requires consistent support\nfor device mobility, QoS, authentication, autho-\nrization, and accounting (AAA),1 and so on. The\nconnectivity layer provides cooperation across\nvarious realizations of networks, called coopera-\ntive connectivity, and shall be independent of the\nvarious transport technologies used to link the\nnodes of the network together.\nBy separating access and transport the CoNet\narchitecture makes it transparent to the common\nand standardized transport infrastructure and\nhides the technology from the end user, while\nfacilitating the most efficient usage of spectrum\nresources. The CoNet architecture shall support\nboth session continuation (i.e., handover when\nthe access technology used is changed) and\nsimultaneous usage of several access networks.\nFinally, the user should be able to seamlessly\nroam across different access technologies and\nadministrative domains without any manual user\nintervention. This implies that the CoNet archi-\ntecture should also support connection of sub-\nscribers to private IP networks through Network\nAddress Translators (NATs) and Simple Traver-\nsal UDP through NATs (STUNs).\nAN END-TO-END APPROACH\nThe CoNet architecture should include the end-\npoints (i.e., terminals) as part of the communica-\ntion system, and support end-to-end (E2E)\nnegotiation and fulfillment of QoS parameters,\nsecurity settings, and so on. This E2E approach\ndoes not mandate that all functionality should be\nlocated in the endpoints. On the contrary, the\nfunctionality can also be provided in hop-by-hop,\nand\/or edge-to-edge manner subject to proper\nand lawful termination of transport connections.\nThe CoNet architecture should ensure that the\ninteroperability of (and communication between)\nheterogeneous endpoints is maintained.\nSECURITY\nThe CoNet architecture should provide a secure-\nly protected environment in which network ele-\nments are deployed and interact. Besides\nprotecting end users and networks from each\nother through authentication and authorization,\nthe components of the CoNet concept should\nalso be protected from any intrusion or mali-\ncious attack. The architecture should provide a\nsecurity framework to enable protection of pri-\nvate information and data. Furthermore, the\nCoNet architecture should provide accounting\ncapabilities and further enhance the AAA\nparadigm. The architecture should be distributed\nand consist of security components able to com-\nmunicate through well defined interfaces. Under-\nlying mechanisms such as DIAMETER [3] would\nprovide the necessary secure communication\nframework where multiple networks cooperate.\nTo accomplish these, we would be well\nadvised to rely on already existing security algo-\nrithms that are stable, resilient, and well estab-\nlished. The creation of new mechanisms and\nprotocols is outside the scope of CoNet. Rather,\nits objective is to build the trust models and\nsecurity associations between the various compo-\nnents of the distributed CoNet architecture with\nscalable access control to distributed compo-\nnents and resources.\nSELF-ORGANIZING CONETS\nThe CoNet architecture is expected to comprise\na number of networks exhibiting different capa-\nbilities in terms of coverage, capacity, transmis-\nsion rates, transmission delay, and transmission\ncost. Networks might be in a cooperative or\ncompetitive relationship with each another.\nPart of the access domain in the wireless\nworld may not be centrally organized in the\nfuture and may even provide infrastructureless\nconnectivity. Nodes may come and go and be\nloosely associated with each other, forming\nalliances whenever and wherever. Such nodes\nthat could be part of the personal, the local, and\neven the global sphere would temporarily coop-\nerate to provide connectivity in an ad hoc man-\nner or share application resources. A network\nthat is a member of the CoNet has to build rela-\ntions with other networks to provide expected\nglobal connectivity and support the demanded\naccess versatility. Relations between cooperative\nnetworks are supposed to be established dynami-\ncally. The creation of these dynamic relation-\nships is a first aspect of self-organization.\nThe dynamic organization of relations\nbetween networks and individual network ele-\nments is supposed to result in a CoNet structure\nthat adapts its topology to meet the demands of\nvarying traffic patterns and transmission\ndemands. To ease administration and operation,\nthe network nodes should mostly be self-config-\nuring, and resources should be distributed among\nthem dynamically to cope with varying traffic\nvolumes and traffic characteristics.\nTHE ARCHITECTURAL FRAMEWORK\nAn architectural framework supporting the\nresearch work on CoNet should aid the structur-\ning of research tasks and identify relevant fields\nof research, including a reference model2 to\nensure that research toward 4G is carried out in\na harmonized and open-ended manner. The\nInformation Society Technology (IST) project\nWireless Strategic Initiative (WSI) has proposed\nits reference model to WWRF.\nTHE WSI REFERENCE MODEL\nThe basic structure of the WSI reference model\ncovers all aspects of the wireless world from\nbusiness models and user issues down to radio\ninterfaces. The reference model describes the\ngrand building blocks of the wireless world and\nhow they interact at reference points, and cap-\ntures user scenarios and different views. The\nmodel also describes what kind of elements can\nbe used to set up future wireless communication\nsystems. It identifies how these elements can\ninteract, the functionality they have to provide,\nand how a system can be composed out of them.\nFollowing the sphere model, developed by\n1 Within the Internet\nEngineering Task Force\n(IETF) AAA combines\nauthentication, authoriza-\ntion, and accounting;\nwithin CoNet this concept\nhas to be enhanced with\nbasic support for charging,\nroaming, auditing, and\ndigital rights management.\n2 The development of the\nWWRF and its reference\nmodel was initiated by the\nEuropean IST project\nWireless Strategic Initia-\ntive [4].\nBesides protecting\nend users and\nnetworks from each\nother through\nauthentication and\nauthorization, the\ncomponents of the\nCoNet concept\nshould also be\nprotected from\nany intrusion or\nmalicious attack.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply. \nIEEE Communications Magazine \u2022 September 2004 73\nthe WSI think tank in 2000, the reference model\nidentifies the building blocks of the wireless\nfuture. The main achievement is the definition\nof a communication element (a representation of\na certain device or node) that acts as a commu-\nnication entity in the different spheres; a large\nnumber of such elements may exist in the wire-\nless world. Depending on their current commu-\nnication context, they can be logically placed in\ndifferent spheres (e.g., global, local, and person-\nal) reflecting the proximity of building blocks\nwith respect to a user. Therefore, the personal\nsphere can be seen as some kind of body area\nnetwork, the local sphere serves as local net-\nworking infrastructure, and the global sphere is\nresponsible for global connectivity.\nThe functionalities integrated in the commu-\nnication elements are provided by different\nbuilding blocks, assuming that the reference\nmodel should separate content processing, con-\ntrol, and management functions (see the sub-\nblocks inside a communication element) into\ntheir own E2E planes and subsystems. The build-\ning blocks that form communication elements\nare connected by vertical and horizontal refer-\nence points. The vertical reference points define\ninterfaces between the building blocks of the\ncommunication elements, and horizontal refer-\nence points define interfaces between communi-\ncation elements that reside in different spheres.\nRESEARCH CHALLENGES\nIn order to figure out features and characteris-\ntics the envisioned network shall have in differ-\nent aspects, it is necessary to identify the\nsignificant requirements for the target network\nin terms of service provisioning and system capa-\nbilities. Those requirements will give an integral\npart of the guiding framework for investigation\nof design philosophies, principles and guidelines\nfor reference models, network functional archi-\ntectures, and solutions for individual functional\ncomponents.\nFurthermore, it is vital to identify and under-\nstand technical components that require further\nresearch, taking into account the requirements for\nthe target network. We describe overall problem\nareas and generic technical issues to be addressed\nto provide guidance for defining the scope and\nspecific targets of respective ongoing and future\nresearch activities\/projects in the field of network-\ning technologies to realize the CoNet vision [5].\nMULTI-ACCESS CAPABILITY\nIn order to enable a system for multiple access\nnetwork technologies, a number of different\nissues need to be investigated. Here we discuss\nsome of these issues.\nThe device needs to be provided with access-\ntechnology-independent capabilities (application\nprogramming interfaces, APIs, and protocols) to\ndetect which different access networks are cur-\nrently available and learn their characteristics.\nSimilarly, mobile terminals should be able to\nscan in a specific environment to discover candi-\ndate available access networks and register some\npolicy issues.\nFurthermore, there are different ways to\nenable access for a user and\/or device over multi-\nple access network technologies. Either the user\ncould log on to each access network separately,\nor the authentication and authorization mecha-\nnisms for the different access networks could be\nconnected to allow the user\/device to move\nbetween different access networks without need-\ning to log on multiple times. Preferably, the user\nshould not have to close down and\/or restart\napplications when moving between different\naccess networks. To enable this, we might need a\nsolution for mobility management that is tied to\nthe logon procedures for the different access net-\nworks. Concurrently, APIs toward the applica-\ntions should be designed so that an application\ncan communicate requirements for access selec-\ntion to the network or device, and also obtain\ninformation about the access network character-\nistics currently used. There is a need for a multi-\naccess paging mechanism. It should be possible\nto page a terminal with multiple accesses even if\nsome of the interfaces are switched off. Since\nB3G systems will potentially have a wireless link\nin the E2E connection that is either inherently\nunreliable and\/or deal with handovers, solutions\nwill be needed to support E2E session-level relia-\nbility, where a session goes into hibernation when\ndisconnection happens and is resumed when a\nsignal reappears after a period of disconnection.\nMOBILITY MANAGEMENT\nThe architectural changes in the networking infra-\nstructure are mainly dictated by the increasing lev-\nels of heterogeneity in modern networks, their\ninterconnectivity, and their transport capabilities.\nSingle access shifts toward multiple simultaneously\nused access networks, also known as multihoming.\nSingle address space shifts to multiple coexistent\naddress spaces \u2014 IPv4, IPv6. Single device usage\nshifts toward multiple device usage: PDA, smart\nphones, laptops, digital cameras, and more, used\ninterchangeably or at the same time for different\npurposes. Additionally, all networking entities\nbecome mobile: users changing devices, devices\nchanging access networks, access networks allocat-\ning network (IP) addresses dynamically and from\ndifferent address spaces. Personal area networks,\nbecoming reality in the immediate future, are\ninherently mobile. The use of vehicular and trans-\nport related networking will also increase with\ncompletely new applications, for example, in the\ntelemetric area, which put new requirements on\ncapabilities for mobility support. In essence,\ndevices and gadgets without networking capabili-\nties today are moving toward being networked as\nthey serve as sinks and sources of digitally format-\nted information and content as well as running\napplications with networking needs.\nConsidering the above background, CoNet\nmobility management primarily consists of two\nmajor functional components: mobility routing\nmanagement, including handover, and location\nmanagement, providing functionality of location\nupdating and paging.\nA large number of technical issues need to be\naddressed in future research in the area of\nmobility management in order to achieve the\nrequired mobility routing capability in future\nnetworks. The following lists some of the issues.\n\u2022 Mobility architecture (mobility support on a\nnumber of levels, layers, and protocols)\nThe building\nblocks that form\ncommunication\nelements are\nconnected by vertical\nand horizontal\nreference points.\nThe vertical reference\npoints define\ninterfaces between\nthe building blocks\nof the communica-\ntion elements, and\nhorizontal reference\npoints define\ninterfaces between\ncommunication\nelements that reside\nin different spheres.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

These networks can\nchange their point of attachment to other net-\nworks because the NEMO physically moves or\nchanges in topology.\nNEMOs appear in different sizes, from small\ngroups with a few devices attached to an MR up\nto NEMOs on ships and trains that might have\nseveral hundred or more mobile nodes (MNs)\nattached to them. The administrative character-\nistics will differ between NEMOs as well,\nwhether the MRs and MNs are administered\nand owned by the same or different entities. In\nsmall NEMOs the MR and MNs are typically\nowned by the same entity, while in large NEMOs\nthe MR(s) and MNs are typically owned by dif-\nferent entities. This affects, among other things,\nthe level of trust between the different nodes.\nDifferent types of MNs have different require-\nments on location updates and connections to\nexternal networks (home operators) when the\nMNs are not actively participating in a session.\nA laptop might not require instantaneous loca-\ntion detection to a peer in another network,\nwhile a cell phone has to be reached immediate-\nly when someone is calling it. This puts different\nrequirements on what and how much update\ntraffic will be sent through the MRs.\nHere are some research areas that could be\naddressed:\n\u2022 Addressing and scalability.\n\u2022 Speed: Some NEMOs may move at high\nspeeds, which puts requirements on hand-\novers and location updates, as well as fre-\nquency of these handovers and location\nupdates.\n\u2022 Mobility management, nested mobility,\naccess control, and security.\n\u2022 Multihoming: A mobile node can be\nattached to multiple ISPs\/operators.\n\u2022 Aggregation of signaling and user data traf-\nfic between MRs and external networks.\nNETWORK COMPONENTS AND\nTECHNOLOGIES\nThe objective of this section is to provide several\npossible solutions for research challenges, such\nas mobility management, multiple access IP\nQoS, and moving networks,3 that are identified\nin [5] and discussed in previous sections.

The solution\nassumes a routing manager and a location man-\nager to reside in the network control sublayer\ncontrolling the access layer. Both management\nfunctions treat routing information and location\ninformation separately. The managers are trig-\ngered from an access layer to initiate access of\nmobile terminals (MTs), and perform handover\nand location updates and other functions. The\nmanagers are not to be directly accessed by the\nMTs. This enables the managers to be protected\nfrom malicious attempts and may evolve inde-\npendent of the access layer.\nThe routing manager creates, updates, and\ndeletes the routing cache in the transport sublay-\ner (i.e., in the routers) for the MT it is currently\nmanaging. The location manager manages the\nMT location information and pages the MT\nwhen necessary. The routers forward packets\nand perform address exchange procedures for\npacket routing and rerouting. This enables MTs\nto communicate at any time without revealing\ntheir locations or movements to the peer termi-\nnal(s). In addition, this mechanism can also real-\nize efficient utilization of radio frequencies\n(resources), MT power consumption, and use of\nnetwork resources. Figure 2 shows a generic\narchitecture of the proposed solution.\nAccording to the vision of CoNet, the IP host\naddress (IPha) of an MT should not have to be\nchanged in order to maintain communication,\neven when the IP routing address (IPra) changes\ndue to its movement.\nThe IPha is used only to identify an MT, while\nthe IPra is used only to transport packets within\nnetworks and thus for location information. On\nthe other hand, MTs are not aware of the IPra by\nexchanging the IPha and IPra at the edge router\n(router between MT and network), and packets\nsent to MTs are not encapsulated. Therefore, the\nproposed routing mechanism can prevent the\nlocation information of the MT being disclosed to\nthe peer terminal. In addition, it can reduce the\npacket header overhead caused by encapsulation.\nFigure 3 shows the separation between IPha\nand IPra. The access router (AR) of a peer ter-\nminal receives the packet of an MT (i.e., the\ndestination address of the packet, which is the\nIPha). It then changes the destination addresses\nfrom IPha to IPra according to the routing\ncache, where the IPha and IPra are mapped; this\nwhole process is managed by the routing manag-\ner. Then the AR forwards the packet to the MT\naccording to its routing table. The packets can\nbe routed to the AR to which the MT is\nattached, since the AR advertises the route in\nthe network prefix of the IPra. The AR to which\nthe MT belongs receives the packet and\nexchanges the destination addresses according to\nthe routing cache from IPra to IPha. Then the\nAR forwards the packets to the MT with the\nIPha as the destination address.\nIf the AR of a peer terminal does not have\nthe routing cache for the MT IPha, the AR\nrequests the routing manager of the MT to set\nthe routing cache for address resolution.\nWhen the MT moves from an AR to another\nAR, the routing manager is triggered by the\nrouting access controller (RAC) in the access\nlayer, as previously mentioned (Fig. 2). Then it\nupdates the routing cache in the AR of the peer\nterminal and creates a new one in the new AR\nto which the MT is attaching.\nBefore the update and creation steps, the\nnew AR allocates the MT with a new IPra and\nnotifies the routing manager of this. The access\nlayer or routing manager triggers the new AR to\nallocate the IPra.\nMULTI-ACCESS IP QOS\nIt is assumed that the E2E packet delivery ser-\nvice is provided at the IP layer. The quality of\nthis delivery service determines the E2E QoS\nthat is available for the applications. From the\n\u0002 Figure 3.

For instance, the\napplication may be associated with a configura-\ntion or management tool that allows the specifi-\ncation of default (qualitative or quantitative)\nQoS parameters assigned to the application.\nAlternatively, a configuration tool may provide\ndefault QoS settings for a group of applications.\n\u2022The QoS requirements need to be trans-\nported to each domain along the E2E path. A\ndomain may use this information to configure\ndomain-specific functions and resources such\nthat the required QoS can be provided within\nthe domain. When a new domain becomes part\nof the E2E connection (due to mobility or, e.g.,\naccess selection) QoS related information may\nhave to be transported to this new domain.\n\u2022Each domain may have specific mechanisms\nto support QoS requirements. Examples of such\nmechanisms include per-flow admission control\nand resource reservation (e.g., in a cellular wire-\nless network), scheduling and prioritization\nmechanisms (e.g., in a differentiated services IP\ndomain), or resource overdimensioning (e.g. in a\nbest effort IP network).\nThe E2E QoS architecture of Fig. 5 builds on\nthe high-level view of Fig. 4 and takes into account\nthe above three aspects of E2E QoS provisioning.\nA communication session typically begins with\nexchanging application and session layer informa-\ntion. Such information exchange allows the\ninvolved parties to negotiate service capabilities\nand application-specific attributes such as encod-\ning formats and version numbers. The communi-\ncating parties may proceed by requesting an\nappropriate bearer service from the network. This\nphase requires that QoS information be distribut-\ned to all domains of the E2E path. Specifically,\nthe requirements on the E2E QoS information\ndistribution mechanism should include:\n\u2022 Applicability over various QoS technologies.\n\u2022 Clear separation from the control informa-\ntion being transported.\n\u2022 Independence from the application.\n\u2022 Independence of the flow identification\n(state association with a user flow and flow\nidentifier must be independent).\n\u2022 Support for both uni- and bidirectional\nreservations\n\u2022 Efficient service re-establishment after\nhandover. In particular, the distribution\nmechanism must be able to seamlessly inter-work\nwith other mobility and handover protocols.\n\u2022 Admission control and resource reservation\nin domains along the E2E path must enable\na domain to communicate the result of an\nadmission decision to involved parties.\nOnce the QoS information is distributed\nalong the E2E path, each domain may configure\nits own respective mechanisms to provide the\nnecessary QoS for the user data flows.\nMOVING NETWORK\nTo support moving network mobility, various\ntechniques are proposed in the IETF NEMO\nWG [7]. However, all these proposals are based\non Mobile IP; thus, there are several open issues,\nwhich are the same as those of Mobile IP from\nthe mobile carriers\u2019 points of view regarding tri-\nangulation and route optimization techniques\n[8]. For instance, because of the packet over-\nhead due to encapsulation, we cannot achieve\nroute optimization and location confidentiality at\nthe same time. In addition, these proposals\nassume that the prefix inside a NEMO is con-\nstant even if handoff occurs. Therefore, it makes\nit possible to hide the mobility of a NEMO from\nMTs; however, it causes more packet overhead\ndue to several encapsulations, or using the rout-\ning header option to support route optimization,\nin comparison to host mobility.\nAs an alternative solution, four concepts are\nproposed: care-of prefix (CoP), aggregate router\n(AGR), concatenated routing management, and hier-\narchical address management to achieve the same\nquality as host mobility. However, location confi-\ndentiality and route optimization cannot be kept at\nthe same time, which is an open issue in Mobile\nIP. In addition, the Mobility Management for IP-\nBased IMT Network Platform (IP2) is proposed as\none of the possible approaches for the next-gener-\nation mobile communications network beyond 3G\nsystems [6, 8] to resolve this open issue.\nAccording to the NEMO\u2019s assumption, the IP\npacket prefix in the NEMO is constant, and the\npacket header size gets bigger than the host. To\nresolve this problem, it is necessary to identify the\ncare-of address (CoA) of an MT in the NEMO as\nwell as the MT that can be anywhere in the core\nnetwork. The CoP enables this. More concisely,\nthe CoP changes the prefix inside the NEMO\nevery time the NEMO moves to another access\nrouter, and gets the correct topological address\n(CoA) of the MT in the NEMO. When the NEMO\nconnects to an AR, the AR assigns a new prefix,\nwhich shows that the NEMO has moved. Each MT\nin the NEMO uses this prefix to generate the CoA.\nIn this way, an MT\u2019s CoA can be identified from\nanywhere in the core network. Furthermore, the\nallocated prefix is original for each NEMO in\norder to avoid generating duplicate CoAs even\n\u0002 Figure 4.

In the CoP, all CoAs of all\nMTs in the NEMO are changed when handoff\noccurs, so the number of binding update signals to\nthe home agents (of all MTs and all core net-\nworks), in order to realize route optimization, are\nsent according to the characteristics of the NEMO,\nas shown in Fig. 6. The aggregate router and con-\ncatenated routing management can solve this prob-\nlem and are described in the following sections.\nAGGREGATE ROUTER\nThe aggregate router (AGR) handles the mobility\nmanagement of a NEMO. This is a router like\nthe modified mobile anchor point (MAP) in Hier-\narchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [9]. In addition,\nthe AGR aggregates the update signals (U-Plane)\nto the ARs of all CNs. This reduces the number\nof binding update signals toward CNs with which\nthe NEMO is communicating. Furthermore, the\npackets destined to the NEMO are always sent\nvia the AGR. Therefore, AGR should be opti-\nmally located, considering route optimization for\neach communication path. Moreover, if the Mov-\ning Network moves too far, we should relocate to\na different AGR. In addition, there are trade-off\nrelationships between route optimization, handoff\ndelay, and AGR relocation frequency. For\ninstance, if the AGR is located near the NEMO,\nit may achieve route optimization and reduced\nhandoff delay, but AGR relocation may occur fre-\nquently. On the other hand, if located far from\nthe core network, an AGR cannot achieve route\noptimization and reduced handoff delay; but in\nthis case, AGR relocation rarely occurs.\nCONCATENATED ROUTING MANAGEMENT\n(CONCATENATED HOME AGENTS)\nIn this concept, each home agent (HA) only\nholds information of an MT\u2019s whereabouts\/\nattachments (e.g., with mobile router 1, MR1),\nwhile the MR1 HA maintains all the binding\ninformation for home address (HoA) and CoA.\nIn this way, we can realize NEMO handoffs only\nby updating the MR1 HA (Fig. 7).\nHIERARCHICAL ADDRESS MANAGEMENT\nWhen the NEMO moves, it is necessary to\ninform the AGR and MR1 HA of the updated\nCoA, since these are changed. Therefore, the\ndata volume of binding update signals is very\nlarge. The proposed address management con-\ncept resolves this issue. Concretely, in this con-\ncept the CoA of each MT in the NEMO consists\nof shared information and individual informa-\ntion. Shared information indicates the location\nof the NEMO, which changes whenever a hand-\noff occurs. On the other hand, individual infor-\nmation provides the location of each MT in the\nNEMO and does not change even if handoff\noccurs. The CoP enables this address manage-\n\u0002 Figure 5.

In more detail, MR1, AGR,\nand MR1 HA manage the binding information\nas mentioned above, so we can realize a handoff\nof the NEMO by updating only the shared (com-\nmon) information (Fig. 8).\nSumming up, hierarchical address manage-\nment including an aggregate router and concate-\nnated routing management makes it possible to\nsupport frequent handoffs.\nIP2 ROUTING FOR THE MOVING NETWORK\nIP2 resolves open issues in Mobile IP, as men-\ntioned earlier [8]. Therefore, by applying the\nfour key technologies for IP2 routing manage-\nment as discussed in the previous subsections,\nwe can get much better results.\nThe IP2 architecture is as shown in Fig. 9,\nwhere the aggregate router and concatenated\nrouting management are introduced in the net-\nwork control sublayer. In this proposed architec-\nture, we can categorize the two routing\nmechanisms by their location confidentiality (i.e.,\nthe location privacy information). Here, one case\nis the gateway, with IPha and IPra, being the\nMR. In this case, the MR deals with IPra, which\nindicates the location of the MTs; thus, we can-\nnot keep the location information confidential\nfrom the MR. Therefore, it may be easier if the\nMR is owned by carriers\/providers. Another case\nis that the gateway with IPha and IPra is an AR.\nIn this case, the MR does not deal with IPra, so\nwe can keep the location information confiden-\ntial from the MR and MTs. Therefore, it is pos-\nsible that users can own the MR (Fig. 10).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis article outlines the CoNet concept, archi-\ntectural principles, and guidelines for research\ninto cooperative networks assuming that B3G\nsystems will be built over generic IP networking\ntechnologies. The article has also presented the\nkey research challenges, research framework,\nand major network components and technolo-\ngies. The key points are that the system should\nbe layered on demand, encourage reuse of inde-\npendent modularized functional blocks, support\nmultiple services and service creation, should\nhave consistent end-to-end connectivity across\ndifferent access technologies, and cooperate in\nterms of network control, operations, and main-\ntenance. The architecture shall include the end-\npoints of the communications as part of the\ncommunication system, should provide a secure\nand trusted environment in which network func-\ntions are performed, and should self-organize\ndynamically. Additionally, the article has pre-\nsented the IST WSI architecture proposed to\nCoNet as a reference model along with some\napproaches to the outlined research challenges.\nFinally, this study has selected three impor-\ntant network components and technologies (i.e.,\nmobility management, multiple access IP QoS,\nand moving networks) in order to provide\nanswers and possible solutions to the research\nchallenges presented in earlier sections.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the con-\ntributions of their colleagues from the CoNet\nSIG in WWRF Working Group 3.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.
