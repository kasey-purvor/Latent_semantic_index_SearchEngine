Vance (2009) \nsummarizes this sarcastically in his \u201cfoundations of a sound economy\u201d where he defines essential \ntraits of contemporary leadership as \u201carrogant, greedy, over-controlling, out of touch, and clueless\u201d \n(p. 179). The speed with which the public blamed leaders for the current economic crisis indicates \nthat ineffectiveness in leaders is just as much part of the general image of leaders as is hailing them \nfor success (cf. the Romance of Leadership approach; Meindl, Ehrlich & Dukerich, 1985). However, \nresearch into people\u2019s everyday images of leaders or implicit leadership theories (Eden & Leviatan, \n1975, 2000) mainly focuses on images of effective or ideal leaders. Some researchers even assume \nthat implicit leadership theories equal everyday beliefs regarding effective leadership (e.g., House, \nHanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004).  \nHowever, theoretical assumptions of the Romance of Leadership approach and the empirical \nevidence based on the concept shows that leaders are regarded as responsible for success and failure \nof organizations (e.g., Meindl, 1990). Consequently, leaders are not exclusively considered effective \nbut also at times considered ineffective. The present paper aims at contributing to a fuller picture of \nleader images by investigating whether implicit leadership theories include of both effective and \nineffective leader traits. \n \nPage 3 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n4 \nNeed for this study \nResearch into cynicism implies that a negative view of leadership can lead to problems with \nleadership influence. Kouzes and Posner (2005) claim that a large proportion of the workforce is \ncynical and that cynics are \u201cless inclined to be influenced\u201d. Thus, leaders may find it difficult to \ninfluence followers who hold negative views about leaders. For research into everyday images of \nleadership, so-called implicit leadership theories, this means that knowing about negative views \ntowards leadership is important to prevent a lack of influence of leaders on their followers. We \nalready know that implicit leadership theories influence the perceptions of actual leaders (e.g., \nSchyns, Felfe & Blank, 2007; Shamir, 1992). However, the prior focus of research into implicit \nleadership theories is mainly around effective or ideal leaders. Therefore, it is not surprising that \nsuch leader images do not include notions of ineffectiveness. While looking into images of effective \nleader is an important area of research, we will argue that this limited focus on ideal leadership \nleaves a blind spot concerning the notion of effectiveness or ineffectiveness comprised in leadership \nbeliefs. The main question of our study is, therefore, to investigate which effective and ineffective \ncharacteristics are ascribed to leaders in general. More specifically, we are aiming to add to the \nknowledge about implicit leadership theories by, first, examining which dimensions people use to \ndescribe leaders in general, not (only) ideal leaders. Second, we look into these dimensions to \nexamine to what extent they are seen as effective or ineffective by the individuals themselves, \nthereby challenging the common assumption that images of leaders in general equal images of \neffective leaders. \n \nImplicit leadership theories - Definition and prior research \nPage 4 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n5 \nImplicit theories represent a special form of cognitive schemata which \u2013 in analogy to \nscientific theories \u2013 are seen as a cognitive network of everyday concepts. With the help of such \nnaive models people try to explain and predict their own and the behavior of others as well as derive \ntheir action strategies. General definitions of implicit leadership theories imply that they are \ncognitive structures containing the traits and behaviors of leaders (Kenney, Schwartz-Kenney, & \nBlascovich, 1996).  \nThus, people in general but specifically followers use their implicit leadership theories to \nexplain their leader\u2019s behavior. Consequently, the same behavior maybe interpreted in a different \nway by different people based on their implicit leadership theories. For example, a leader giving \nhis\/her opinion in a meeting might be seen as dominant by one follower (possibly leading to no \nfurther involvement in the discussion) or consultative by another (possibly leading to an \ninvolvement in a discussion around the issue in question).  \nCertainly the most extensive groundwork in this area has been undertaken by Robert Lord and \nhis associates (e.g. Lord, Foti, & De Vader, 1984; Lord & Maher, 1991; Phillips & Lord, 1986). \nLord and colleagues developed the theoretical foundation of implicit leadership theories based on \nRosch\u2019s (1978) cognitive categorization theory. The basic idea of leadership categorization theory is \nthat perceivers (e.g., followers) classify stimulus persons (e.g., their supervisors) by comparing them \nto prototypes of a category (e.g., effective leader). \nExamples for studies into implicit leadership theories include research focusing on the \ninfluence of performance information on the perception of leadership, thereby examining the social \nconstruction of leadership (see Lord & Maher, 1991, for an overview); the content of implicit \nleadership theories (e.g., Offermann, Kennedy, & Wirtz, 1994); the effect of implicit leadership \ntheories on the perception of a specific leader (e.g., Ensaria & Murphy, 2003; Shamir, 1992); and \nPage 5 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n6 \nthe effect of a fit between implicit leadership theories and actual leader behavior (Nye, 2005; Nye & \nForsyth, 1991; Epitropaki & Martin, 2005). For the pupose of this paper, research into the content of \nimplicit leadership theories is of special importance. \n \nImplicit leadership theories as theories of effective leaders \nWhat we are interested in our study is the question of whether or not implicit leadership \ntheories of individuals comprise of effective as well as ineffective characteristics. Effectiveness and \nineffectiveness respectively are usually defined as (not) being successful with regard to the \nachievement of goals. As we focus here on everyday images of leaders in general, effectiveness is \nnot meant in any objective way but purely as a mental model about whether or not characteristics \nnamed by participants are felt by them to be successful or not. An example may illustrate this point: \nPrior research into implicit leadership theories has found \u201ctyranny\u201d as one characteristic that is used \nto describe leaders in general (Offermann et al., 1994). Whereas clearly several participants of that \nresearch have mentioned characteristics that can be subsumed under tyranny, we do not know \nwhether or not they thought is was an effective or an ineffective leadership characteristic. People \nmay indeed differ in their judgment, with some thinking that effective leaders need to be tyrannical \nand others disagreeing. We argue here that without asking the people who name characteristics \nrelevant to tyranny to rate these characteristics on effectiveness, researchers have no way to tell in \nhow far aspects of people\u2019s implicit leadership theories include effectiveness or ineffectiveness. It \nhas to be noted that effectiveness may mean different things for different people: Some people may \nthink of \u201chard\u201d criteria for effectiveness (such as company performance), others of \u201csoft\u201d criteria \n(e.g., job satisfaction).  \nPage 6 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n7 \nIn some lines of research, this focus on effective leaders is explicitly chosen. For instance, \nKenney and his colleagues (Kenney et al., 1996) examined the leader category \u201cleaders worthy of \ninfluence\u201d. Gardner and Avolio (1998) introduce the \u201ccharismatic leader\u201d as a subtype of the \ngeneral leader prototype that is reserved for those leaders who engage in visionary behavior. \nAnother example is Keller (1999) who assesses ideal images under the heading of implicit \nleadership theories. Similarly, research on the think-manager-think-male phenomenon (Schein, \n1973, 1975; Sczesny, 2003) and research on match between implicit leadership theories and actual \nleader behavior (Nye & Forsyth, 1991; Nye, 2002, 2005) focused on ideal or effective leaders. \nOther research seems to more or less tacitly concentrate on effective leader traits. One of the \nbiggest endeavors to capture implicit leadership theories across different cultures has been the \nGLOBE project (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness: Den Hartog, House, \nHanges, Ruiz-Quantanilla, & Dorfman, 1999). As the main result the authors show that managers \nfrom different countries had in part very similar ideas about leader attributes (contributing or \ninhibiting outstanding leadership). While the researchers in this project assert to assess implicit \nleadership theories and define them as ideas about how leaders are and the expectations others have \nof them (House et al., 2004), their assessment of implicit leadership theories is limited to attributes \nthat facilitate or inhibit effective leadership (indeed the wording of the answer scale refers to \ninhibition of outstanding leadership; House et al., 2004). We think that it is not enough to say that \nsomething inhibits effective leadership when drawing conclusions about ineffective leadership. \nInhibition of effective leadership could simply mean that this characteristic does not contribute to \neffectiveness. It could be meaningless or its absence may lead to less effectiveness. In our opinion, \nthis does not mean the same as ineffective leadership.  \n \nPage 7 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n8 \nDifferentiating leaders and effective leaders \nA study that explicitly differentiates between the categories \u201cleaders\u201d and \u201ceffective leaders\u201d \nwas conducted by Offermann et al. (1994). Their extensive investigation focused on characteristics \ncomprised in implicit leadership theories. Their starting point was to ask their participants to list \ncharacteristics of leaders \/ supervisors. They extracted 160 characteristics which were then rated by \na different set of participants as characteristic or not characteristic for either (1) leaders, (2) effective \nleaders, or (3) supervisors. Using parallel analysis, they found that the factor solutions for all targets \nwere comparable and yielded six factors describing leaders (sensitivity, tyranny, intelligence, \ndevotion, charisma, and attractiveness). Additional analysis separated by gender showed an \nadditional factor (\u2018strength\u2019) and that \u2018attractiveness\u2019 could be further differentiated into \n\u2018attractiveness\u2019 and \u2018masculinity\u2019. Ultimately, Offermann et al. derived a list of forty-one \ncharacteristics that can be used to assess implicit leadership theories quantitatively. Sample \ncharacteristics comprise: intelligent, knowledgeable, educated, clever (intelligence dimension) and \ndomineering, pushy, manipulative, loud, conceited, selfish (tyranny dimension).  \nTwo main results of the study are especially noteworthy for our purpose. First, the factor \nstructure did not differ across the different targets of leader, effective leader and supervisor. Second, \nthe largest difference in the level of rating was found between the category supervisor and the two \nother targets of leader and effective leader. These latter two significantly differed only on two of the \neight dimensions (i.e., tyranny and strength).  \nBased on this work of Offermann et al., Epitropaki and Martin (2004) set out to cross-\nvalidate the findings and develop a shorter implicit leadership theories scale. They come to a \nreduced set of items (i.e., 21) and factors (i.e., sensitivity, intelligence, dedication, dynamism, \ntyranny, and masculinity) which form higher order factors, which the authors called the leadership \nPage 8 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n9 \nprototype (including sensitivity, intelligence, dedication, and dynamism) and the leadership \nantiprototype (tyranny and masculinity).  \nBased on these results, it seems that there is (1) no important difference between implicit \ntheories of leaders and effective leaders with regard to structure and level of rating, and (2) that \nattributes usually regarded as favorable (i.e., sensitivity; intelligence; dedication; \ndynamism\/charisma and strength) receive higher prototypicality ratings than those commonly \nregarded as unfavorable (tyranny, masculinity). It seems evident to conclude that leaders in general \nare seen as effective with prototypical attributes that are all favorable. Accordingly, the unfavorable \nattributes such as tyranny and masculinity compose an antiprototype and are an expression of \nineffectiveness. But can we really draw these conclusions? \nFirst, the terms \u2018prototype\u2019 and \u2018antiprototype\u2019 are probably misleading in this context. In \nOffermann et al.\u2019s study, all attributes were named when asking the subjects to list traits and \ncharacteristics of a leader. Hence, also the attributes comprised in the dimensions \u2018tyranny\u2019 and \n\u2018strength\u2019 were connected to this category. The mean prototypicality ratings for these dimensions \nwere lower than those for the more favorable aspects, implying that these aspects were regarded as \nnot very characteristic for a leader. Using the term \u2018antiprototype\u2019 to describe these attributes, \nhowever, implies that they are absolutely uncharacteristic of a leader or, better, characteristic of a \nnon-leader. In our opinion, Offermann et al.\u2019s study does not support this view as all attributes were \nnamed as characteristic for a leader. \nSecond, the study by Offermann et al. (1994) does not allow concluding that the images of \nleader in general and effective leader do not differ substantially. The authors themselves are rather \ncautious in this respect and state \u201cit is possible that the cue \u2018leader\u2019 naturally calls forth the image of \nan effective leader\u201d (Offerman et al., 1994, p. 55). Interestingly, a study of implicit leadership \nPage 9 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n10 \ntheories in the political context (Foti, Fraser & Lord, 1982) found considerable differences between \nthe prototypes of political leaders and effective political leaders (though on the same dimensions). \nThis is interesting as political leaders may not trigger the same notion of effectiveness as the label \n\u201cleaders\u201d and, thus, participants are more likely to mention ineffectiveness as part of their implicit \nleadership theories in this context. \nThird, if the respondents really thought of effective leaders when giving their answers, then \nthe low mean ratings for tyranny and masculinity would actually mean that these traits are not very \ncharacteristic for effective leaders. This is not the same as to say that they are traits of ineffective \nleaders. Consequently, negative attributes need not per se to be an expression of ineffective \nleadership.  \n \nImplicit leadership theories - Conclusion \nTo summarize, most research on implicit leadership theories is concerned with the attributes of \neffective or ideal leaders and or does not question the effectiveness of dimensions used to describe \nleaders in general. There is a lack in prior research concerning the question whether leaders in \ngeneral are considered effective. We therefore investigate the attributes people use to describe \nleaders in general more closely. It seems promising to compare the views on leaders in general with \nprior findings to see to what extent they overlap. It seems that researchers into implicit theories \nassume the term \u201cleader\u201d only has a positive connotation, and therefore do not acknowledge or \nexplore where negative or ineffective leadership qualities may fit into one\u2019s general leadership \nschema. The question we want to answer here is: Does the term \u201cleader\u201d only have positive \nconnotations, as most implicit leadership theorists seem to assume, or does it also invoke have \nassociations of ineffectiveness?1  \nPage 10 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n11 \n \n \nMethod \nDesign, procedure and instrument \nConger (1998) stresses the importance of qualitative research as the concept of leadership involves \n\u201cmultiple levels of phenomena, possesses a dynamic character, and has a symbolic component\u201d \n(Conger, 1998: 109). Given the focus of the present study on implicit leadership theories, the \nsymbolic and subjective character of leadership is particularly emphasized. As Offermann et al. \n(1994) probably provide the most extensive example of a qualitative research in the area of \ncharacteristics included in implicit leadership theories, we take their work as a starting point for our \nanalysis and therefore concentrate on traits comprised in implicit leadership theories rather than \nbehaviors. The attributes named should be evaluated concerning their effectiveness to examine if our \nparticipants\u2019 image of leaders in general is that of an effective leader or an ineffective leader. \nIn order to assess implicit leadership theories, the participants were asked to name six \nattributes of a leader in general and to rate these characteristics and the leader in general on \neffectiveness. Participants were presented the following request: \u201cImagine a leader in general. This \nrefers to your image of a leader, based on your experience with different leaders on different levels \nin the organization during your work life. Describe this \u2018leader in general\u2019 using at least six \nattributes. These can be positive\/effective but also negative\/ineffective.\u201d2 Participants were asked to \nrate the leader in general on a scale from 1 = very ineffective to 5 = very effective. The participants \nwere also asked to indicate for each attributes if they found this to be an effective or an ineffective \ncharacteristic.  \nParticipants \nPage 11 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n12 \nOur study was conducted in the Netherlands in 2005 and 2006, thus prior to the current economic \ncrisis. Indeed, at the time, the labor market in the Netherlands showed very low unemployment \nrates. 76 participants took part in our study. 20 of these worked in a clothes shop (15% men, 85% \nfemale), 22 in a grocery shop (50% male, 50% female) and 34 came from various backgrounds \n(61.8% male, 35.3% female). The average age was 29 years (SD = 6.36), 29 (SD = 10.78), and 41 \n(SD = 11.66), in the grocery shop, the clothes shop and the heterogeneous sample, respectively. The \naverage of work experience was 9.28 years (SD = 6.74) in the clothes job, 9.94 (SD = 11.32) in the \ngrocery shop and 17.13 years (SD = 12.85) in the heterogeneous sample.  \nContent analysis procedures \nIn qualitative studies, the data analysis procedures are often only described vaguely if at all \n(Conger, 1998). But if qualitative research wants to break free from the stigma of being \u201cnot \nscientific\u201d, \u201carbitrary\u201d, or \u201csubjective\u201d, it has to follow systematic and transparent ways for data \ncollection, analysis, and reporting (Bachiochi & Weiner, 2002; Creswell, 1998). To achieve this, \nqualitative content analysis (Mayring, 2000) was chosen as an approach that combines the strengths \nof the grounded theory approach in the discovery of \u201cnatural\u201d categories (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; \nStrauss & Corbin, 1998) with strategies from traditional content analysis (Krippendorff, 1980). It is \ncharacterized by the aim to achieve a systematic qualitative text interpretation which is characterized \nby the following principles (Mayring, 2000; Schilling, 2006):  \n\u2022 Fitting the material into a model of communication: Based on the aims of the assessment, it has \nto be determined what parts of the communication are in the focus of analysis (e.g. the topic,  \nthe communicator himself, the text itself or the effect of the message). \n\u2022 Rules of analysis: The material is analysed step by step in a rule-based procedure, devising the \nmaterial into content analytical units. \nPage 12 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n13 \n\u2022 Categories in the centre of analysis: The different text units are categorized. The categories can \nbe developed inductively or applied deductively, but should be carefully founded and revised \nwithin the process of analysis. \n\u2022 Criteria of reliability and validity: The procedure should be comprehensible in order to compare \nthe results to other studies and carry out checks for reliability. \n \nAs the questions concerning the ideal and the actual leader mainly served the purpose of \nfocusing the participants and preventing intrusions from other leader images (see above), the \nfollowing steps of qualitative content analysis were applied only to the answers concerning the \nleader in general:  \n1. Structuring the material into different dimensions (i.e., attribtes and behaviors). As we were only \ninterested in the statements concerning traits of leaders in general, all statements referring to \nleader behavior were deleted (as proposed by Offermann et al., 1994). We asked participants \nspecifically in our instructions to indicate attributes of leaders. Therefore, participants indicating \nbehaviors violated the instructions. Therefore, not all participants may have used both attributes \nand behaviors, leading to a bias in the analyses if we had included behaviors that some \nparticipants named but not including those of participants that followed instructions. All the \nmaterial was controlled by a second researcher for the appropriateness of the reduction (i.e., \nchecking if the deleted statements really addressed behavior and the remaining statements were \nfocused on attributes). \n2. Step by step formulation of categories based on a preliminary category system. This included the \nbasic processes of naming and comparing the data fragments to develop categories for multiple \nstatements (i.e., different notions from one person) and if necessary subsuming old or \nPage 13 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n14 \nformulating new categories (Conger, 1998). As we aimed at comparing our results with existing \nresearch, Offermann et al.\u2019s (1994) categories (sensitivity, tyranny, intelligence, devotion, \ncharisma, attractiveness, masculinity, and strength) served as a preliminary model guiding the \ncontent analysis.  \n3. Revising the categories after 50 percent of the material was coded. The agreement of different \nraters was checked, cases of doubt and problems with the scope and overlapping of the \ncategories were discussed within the research team consisting of two researchers and three \nstudents (Mayring, 2000). The categories were refined in a way that each category was extended \nby its opposite (e.g., devoted\/disinterested; tyrannical\/participative). This two-sidedness of \ncategories used to describe person images is a well-known result from research on personal \nconstructs theory (Bannister & Fransella, 1981). \n4. Checking the category codes: About two-thirds of the way through the material, the developing \ncategory system was checked to prevent drifting into an idiosyncratic sense of what the codes \nmean (Miles & Huberman, 1994). Six typical examples (three in the original direction, three \nopposites) were assigned to each category to illustrate the content of the respective category \n(e.g., tyrannical\/participative: authoritarian, bossy, imperious versus cooperative, collegial). \n5. Final revision of the material. The data set was reexamined to make sure that the categories are \nfully described. Cases of doubt were categorized independently by two researchers; differences \nin the coding were discussed and resolved.3 \n \nQuantitative analyses \nDescriptive numerical analyses were used to complement the qualitative content analyses. Even the \nrather basic measures of absolute topic frequency (i.e., total number of times a category is addressed \nPage 14 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n15 \nacross all interviewees), relative topic frequency (i.e., average percentage of a category in \ncomparison to the total number of statements across all interviewees) and person frequency (i.e., \nhow many of the participants address a certain theme at all) are helpful to avoid weighting single \ncomments too heavily and generalizing findings too quickly (cp. Schilling, 2006). Although it is \ntempting to include the most vivid, interesting or surprising quotes (Bachiochi & Weiner, 2002), \nthese frequency analyses can help to critically evaluate how representative these statements are for \nthe whole sample. \n \nResults \nAttributes of leaders in general. In total, the participants made 349 statements concerning their \nviews on the attributes of leaders in general. The average number of statements was 4.59 (SD = \n1.82; minimum = 1, maximum = 8). Including two new categories that emerged in the last step of \nour analyses, fifteen categories emerged (see Appendix for further explanation of the categories). \nWith the exception of masculinity, all of Offerman et al.\u2019s (1994) categories were also addressed \n(sensitivity, tyranny, intelligence, devotion, charisma, strength, and attractiveness). New categories \nconcerning the characteristics of leaders in general include being pleasant, being a team-player, \ncommunicative, extraverted, organized, conscientious, honest, and being open for new experiences.  \nFrequencies. Having a look at both directions of our category system, the six subcategories \nthat were used most often by our participants were charismatic (30), tyrannical (28), team player \n(25), communicative (25), devoted (24), and conscientious (20). The subcategories honest and \nunattractive were not used at all (i.e., only the categories\u2019 opposites were addressed). Extra- (2) and \nintroverted (1), participative (1), attractive (1), unorganized (1), and dishonest (2) yielded very few \nstatements. The bandwidth of the statements is expressed by the fact that there are no single \nPage 15 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n16 \nsubcategories dominating the views of the subjects. Also, an inspection of topic and person \nfrequencies does not reveal outstanding dissimilarities concerning the importance and pervasiveness \nof a subcategory (see Table 1). Concerning the combined categories (original category plus its \nopposite), team player\/individualist (38; 10.9%), charismatic\/non-charismatic (34; 9.7%) \npleasant\/unpleasant (33; 9.5%) and communicative\/not-communicative (31; 8.9%) receive the \nhighest number of statements. The categories attractive\/unattractive (1; 0.3%), honest\/dishonest (2; \n0.6%) and introvert\/extravert (3; 0.9%) only play a minor role in the beliefs of the participants.  \nEffectiveness\/ineffectiveness. Concerning the effectiveness of leader attributes, the \nparticipants categorized 225 statements as effective (64.5%), 119 (34.1%) were regarded as \nineffective, 5 statements (1.4%) were not clearly labelled as either effective or ineffective. The \nrelative high number of statements rated as ineffective (119) indicates, as we assumed, that implicit \nleadership theories are composed of both effective and ineffective attributes. Moreover, by way of \nan exploratory analysis, we used both sides of our category systems to compare the effectiveness \nratings concerning the subcategories. Table 2 shows the cross-table indicating the number and \npercentage of statements that are normally seen as \u201cfavorable\u201d (e.g., pleasant, attractive, teamplayer, \ncharismatic) and those that are usually regarded as \u201cunfavorable\u201d (e.g., unpleasant, unattractive, \nindidualist, non-charismatic; cp. Offermann et al., 1994) that were rated as effective and ineffective \nby the participants. The most interesting numbers for our purposes are the \u201cunfavorable\u201d statements \nthat are considered effective (6.0%) and the \u201cfavorable\u201d ones that are considered ineffective (7.3%). \nWhile these proportions are small, they still show that there is at least no deterministic connection \n(i.e., all favorable traits are seen as effective and al unfavorable are seen as ineffective) between \nfavorable and effective or unfavorable and effective in the implicit leadership theories of our \nparticipants. \nPage 16 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n17 \n \nSummary and discussion \nThe starting point of our study was to address the question which effective and ineffective \ncharacteristics are ascribed to leaders in general. Based on qualitative statements we derived fifteen \ncategories describing leaders in general such as tyrannical, intelligent and organized. Asking our \nparticipants to rate the characteristics they named revealed that implicit leadership theories are \ncomposed of both effective and ineffective attributes.  \nWe used Offermann et al.\u2019s (1994) categories as a foundation for our categorization and \nfound some overlap between our and their categories. Like Offermann et al. (1994) and Lord et al. \n(1984), we found charisma (charismatic\/non-charismatic), decisiveness\/strength (strong\/weak), \ndedication (devoted\/disinterested), tyranny (tyrannical\/participative), verbal skills \n(communicative\/not-communicative) understanding\/sensitivity (sensitive\/hard) and intelligence \n(intelligent\/stupid) as important aspects in implicit leadership theories. However, some categories \nfound in prior research were seldomly addressed (attractiveness; cp. Epitropaki & Martin, 2004, \nwho argue that attractiveness may be neither a core prototypic or antiprototypic leadership attribute) \nor even non-existing (honesty, masculinity), others had to be added (especially \nteamplayer\/individualist, pleasant\/unpleasant and open\/narrow-minded). Compared to the results of \nOffermann et al. (1994), the statements in the present study are much more varied resulting in a \nlarger and more complex category system. The resulting category system should be regarded as a \nstarting point for a fresh look at the contents of implicit leadership theories. The relatively high \ndegree of unfavorable attributes named to characterize leaders may indicate that, while implicit \nleadership theories are mainly coined by positive images, the images of leaders in general are not \ncompletely romanticized. Our results also indicate that the quite reasonable assumption that \nPage 17 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n18 \nfavorable characteristics reflected in implicit leadership theories are effective and unfavorable \ncharacteristics are ineffective cannot be upheld completely. Over 13% of statements of our \nparticipants fell into the positive\/ineffective and negative\/effective quadrant. It seems to be \nnecessary to distinguish more carefully between implicit theories concerning leaders in general, \neffective and positive (i.e., sympathetic) leaders. As the connectionist model of Lord, Brown, \nHarvey, and Hall (2001) pointed out, the \u2018leader\u2019 category is not as static and fixed as formerly \nbelieved. The present results underline the importance of being very careful with the specific \nquestions we are asking in implicit leadership theories studies. They most certainly work as \nconstraints in sense of Lord et al. (2001) and may activate quite different aspects of our leadership \nbeliefs.  \nWith respect to the practical implication of our research, some tentative conclusions can be \ndrawn. We know from prior research that implicit leadership theories are related to the perception of \nactual leaders (e.g., Schyns et al., 2007; Shamir, 1992) and their evaluation (Nye & Forsyth, 1991). \nWhile there is more research needed into the different degrees of effectiveness included in implicit \nleadership theories and how those implicit leadership theories affect the perception of leaders, we \ncan assume that people with a more ineffective image of leaders may view their actual leaders in a \nmore negative light and may rate them more negatively. There is a danger of a self-fulfilling \nprophecy when followers that hold ineffective implicit leadership theories do not exert as much \neffort for their leader as they could do. The question also arises in how far followers who hold \nimplicit leadership theories that comprise ineffectiveness will respond to attempts of leaders to \ninfluence them (cf. Kouzes & Posner, 2005).  \n \nLimitations and future research \nPage 18 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n19 \nAs any research, our study has limitations that are worth noting. First, while our study has a \nrelatively large sample size for a qualitative study, the sample is still too small to generalize. Thus, \nour study can only serve as a starting point for future research. Second, our study took place in the \nNetherlands and can therefore not necessarily be cross-culturally generalized. Prior qualitative \nresearch on implicit leadership theories in China (Ling, Chia, & Fang, 2000) found completely \ndifferent categories as compared to Offermann et al.\u2019s (1994) US American results. Although we \nused Offermann et al.\u2019s categories as a starting point, it cannot be ruled out that some of our \ncategories are unique to the Dutch working context. However, the categories that were not supported \nin our study (attractiveness and masculinity) were also the weakest ones in Offermann et al.\u2019s study, \nwhich indicates that our data are not completely different from prior American research.  \nThe interpretation of the statements into categories by our participants was undertaken by \nresearchers and not confirmed by the participants themselves. In order to enhance the credibility of \nour interpretation, we excluded cases that were unclear without the context that only the respective \nparticipant could provide. Although this led to quite a few items in the miscellaneous category, it \nleft the categorization less open to speculation.  \nIn our categorization scheme, we use a favorable and an unfavorable anchor for our \ncategories. However, the judgment was made by the researcher and not confirmed with the \nparticipants. While led by prior research such as Lord et al. (1984), Offermann et al. (1994) and \nEpitropaki & Martin (2004), this may be criticized as our personal interpretation. Although it seems \nunlikely that, for example, stupid or unattractive are considered positive characteristics, we cannot \ncompletely rule out that our participants perceived them as such. Future research should therefore \nexamine the emotional value (e.g. likeability) attached to our categories. \nPage 19 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n20 \nWe asked our participants to rate the attributes they named themselves with regard to \neffectiveness. However, we did not explain to them what effectiveness means. Rather we wanted to \nassess effectiveness as a part of their implicit leadership theories. Therefore, we do not know which \ncriteria our participants used to rate effectiveness. Indeed, we would assume that similar to implicit \nleadership theories themselves, ratings of effectiveness draw on different dimensions. That is to say \nthat our participants will likely mean different things when it comes to defining effectiveness. A \ngeneral example from prior literature is that leaders seem to consider objective performance as more \nimportant than followers whereas followers find job satisfaction more important (Dansereau, 1995). \nThus, whether or not our participants were thinking of \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d effectiveness, we do not \nknow. To study this in more detail, a future study could either ask each individual about his\/her \ncriteria for effectiveness or clarify which type of effectiveness is to be used to rate the named \ncharacteristics.  \n Again, in terms of effectiveness, we referred to effectiveness of actual leaders in the \ninstructions for our participants. One may discuss, whether there are indeed different types of \neffectiveness, depending on whether someone is already in leadership position or indeed wants to \nemerge as leader4. Some characteristics may be useful in leader emergence (e.g., dominance) but \nmaybe less so in leader effectiveness once in the position.  \nOur instructions explicitly asked our participants to name characteristics that could be \nnegative\/ineffective. This might have triggered more negative\/ineffective attributes than a neutral \ninstruction. Although we collected further data without this possibly biasing instruction and the \nresults were comparable, we would still recommend for future research to use neutral instructions to \navoid demand characteristics.   \n \nPage 20 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n21 \nConclusion \nOur study addressed a shortcoming in prior research into implicit leadership theories, namely the \nassumption that images of leaders in general comprise of images of effective leaders. Using a \nrelatively large sample (for a qualitative study), we could show that images of leaders in general \ncontain characteristics that are regarded as effective and characteristics that are regarded by our \nparticipants as ineffective. Consequently, future research needs to distinguish more carefully \nbetween the different implicit leadership theories of participants depending on the goal of the \nrespective study. This is crucial when conducting research regarding the perception of leaders, as \nineffective implicit leadership theories may have different effect on the perception of leaders than \neffective ones. Leaders may find it more difficult to influence followers who hold ineffective \nimplicit leadership theories. Knowledge about ineffective implicit leadership theories can help \nleaders to overcome this problem, for example, by trying to influence their followers\u2019 implicit \nleadership theories or by making clear that they as leaders are very much different from these \nimplicit leadership theories. \nPage 21 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n22 \nReferences \nAltman, D.

To \naddress this concern, we drew a small sample of (Dutch) employees (N = 11), to whom we \nadministered the same questionnaire as the one used in this study with two alterations: (1) We asked \nto indicate not more than six attributes (to ensure easy comparison between the participants) and (2) \naltered the instruction by leaving out the reference to positive\/negative, effective\/ineffective. We \nwanted to check in how far participants would still use positive\/negative, effective\/ineffective \nattributes without the prompt. On average, the participants named 5.7 characteristics out of which \nthey rated 2.9 as ineffective. Many of the attributes were indeed quite negative (e.g., incapable, \ninconsequent). Comparing our results to the original data in terms of being favourable\/unfavourable \nand effective\/ineffective, the following distribution emerged:  \n effective ineffective \nfavorable 43.10% 8.62% \nunfavorable 3.45% 44.83% \nPage 32 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nImplicit leadership theories \n33 \n                                                                                                                                                                   \nThus, we conclude that that our instructions did not prompt our participants to name \npositive\/negative, effective\/ineffective characteristics but that these are indeed part of an image of \nleaders in general.  \n3 We used the new data outlined in footnote 2 to calculate the inter-rater reliability of the two \ncoders. In 73% of the cases both coders independently agreed on the same category. The resulting \nCohens Kappa was .71 which can be evaluated as a good degree of inter-rater agreement (cp. \nAltman, 1991).  \n4\n We would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out to us. \nPage 33 of 33\nhttp:\/\/mc.manuscriptcentral.com\/jomi\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n"}
