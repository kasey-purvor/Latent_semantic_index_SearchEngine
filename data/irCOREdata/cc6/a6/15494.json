Egyptian Mummies and Modern Science. Cambridge, \nCambridge University Press. 304pp. ISBN 97805218665791. \u00a3UK 60.00; US $100.00. \n \nRosalie David , Professor and Director of the KNH Centre for Biomedical Egyptology, \nUniversity of Manchester, has for over 30 years led the study of Egyptian mummies and \nassociated materials at Manchester. Starting in 1973 when the Manchester Egyptian \nMummy Research Project was established, multidisciplinary research on mummies has \ngrown and flourished and, in 2003, the KNH Centre was set up in the Faculty of Life \nSciences. This has led to more recent applications of scientific techniques to mummified \ntissue, including the development of a Mummy Tissue Bank as a valuable resource for \nsuch research. This book \u2018provides the first opportunity to present the complete picture of \nthe Manchester team\u2019s more recent studies\u2019 with its aim to \u2018demonstrate how scientific \nstudies on mummies can provide new insights into the ancient Egyptian\u2019s attitudes to life \nand death\u2019 (p. xix-xx); its aim is fulfilled. \n \nThe book is divided into five parts: Introduction to the scientific study of mummies \n(aims, methods and developments of the Project), Diet, disease and death in ancient \nEgypt: diagnostic and investigative techniques (studies on human and animal remains), \nThe treatment of disease in ancient Egypt (comparison of  data from the Project with \nliterary evidence, along with consideration of therapeutic efficacy), Resources for \nstudying mummies (establishment and role of the Mummy Tissue Bank), and finally the \nfuture of biomedical and scientific studies in Egyptology (summary of contributions and \nfuture research directions). The studies described are considered in the wider context of \nmummy studies and Egyptology and are, essentially, a \u201cshow case\u201d of more recent work \nin Manchester. \n \nThe \u2018Introduction\u2019 has two chapters, both by David. \u2018Background to the Project\u2019 \ndocuments the longstanding interest in Egyptian mummies going back to the \nRenaissance. It then describes the first Egyptian mummy autopsies at Manchester by \nMargaret Murray, back in 1908, followed by a discussion of the Manchester Mummy \nProject created shortly after David\u2019s appointment in 1972 as curator of the Egyptology \nCollection at the Manchester Museum. A multidisciplinary approach was emphasised \nfrom the outset with the use of available techniques of analysis. Three phases of the \nProject are described (1973-1978; 1979-1995, and 1995 to present). One of the major \nparts of the final phase has been research on schistosomiasis in ancient and modern \nEgypt, described later in Chapter 8; this particular project led to the formation of the \nInternational Ancient Egyptian Mummy Tissue Bank. The second chapter overviews \nEgyptian mummies, including their historical background, mummification and their \nenvironmental context.  \n \n\u2018Diet, disease and death\u2019 has nine chapters (Imaging, Endoscopy, Dental health, \nHistology, Palaeopathology literature review, Immunocytochemistry, DNA, Analytical \nmethods, and Facial reconstruction); this is, not surprisingly, the \u201cmeat\u201d of the book and \nis contained in around 160 pages. Many of the chapters provide an historical perspective \nto the particular techniques used, and most are well illustrated (including very well \nproduced colour images of histological sections of mummy tissue in the centre of the \nbook). \u201cPalaeopathology\u201d provides a useful perspective on how mummification \nprocedures and materials used can have an effect on the ability to recognise pathological \nconditions, and it gives a summary of methods mummification techniques. The chapter \nthen describes some of the diseases that have been recognised in both skeletons and \nmummies from a global perspective. At this point it would have been better to only \nconcentrate on Egyptian mummy evidence in a book devoted to Egyptian mummies. \nBecause the chapter tries to take a wide view of evidence of disease, it cannot (and does \nnot) take an all encompassing and critical view of the relevant literature, which makes for \na rather weak part of the book. For example, the section on plague reviews ancient DNA \nresearch from France (1998 and 2002) but this work has been questioned in more recent \nyears, while the section on leprosy does not even mention the published evidence in both \nmummified and skeletal remains from Egypt; finally, the section on tuberculosis is \nlimited to 12 lines and defers to a book published in 2003. The aDNA analysis chapter \nsurveys the potential and limitations of such analyses and provides examples of studies \non Egyptian mummies. While interesting and informative, I was disappointed not to see a \nmore critical review of the methodologies used and the real need for better \nstandardisation of methods and procedures between laboratories, as described in Cooper \nand Poinar (2000, in Science). The chapter on facial reconstruction emphasises how \nManchester has been at the forefront of developing this method for \u201cbringing to life\u201d the \nfacial appearance of ancient Egyptians. It charts the methods applied and how facial \nreconstruction has been used in Egyptology from depictions of ancient people\u2019s faces to \nshowing the effects on the face of trauma and disease. \n \n\u2018Treatment of disease\u2019 has three chapters (the Ancient Egyptian Medical System, \nIntoxicants, and Pharmacy). Sources for Egyptian medicine are the focus of the first \nchapter, incorporating archaeological, written and artistic evidence, along with evidence  \nin human remains; the latter section, albeit limited compared to the other data, could have \nusefully described in more detail some of the direct evidence for treatment such as \nsplinting fractures (with references). The last chapter in this section (Pharmacy) has \ninformative data on how therapeutically effective drugs used in ancient Egypt might have \nbeen. \u2018Resources\u2019 has two chapters on the Mummy Tissue Bank and on Conservation \ntechniques. The Bank developed from the concept of tissue banking to support medical \nresearch, and \u2018was the first formal project, on an international scale, to seek material from \nEgyptian mummies held in collections outside Egypt\u2019 (p.240). It has pioneered the \ncollection of mummy tissue samples for future analyses over the last 11 years that it has \nbeen established, and currently holds 1400 samples. \u2018The Future\u2019 concludes the book and \nis written by David; of all the contributors, she is the most qualified to predict the future \nfrom what has gone before. The presence of the Centre for Biomedical Egyptology, a \ngraduate research programme, and a masters course in Biomedical and Forensic Studies \nin Egyptology, all at the University of Manchester, provide a base from which future \nresearch will undoubtedly develop in this field. The strong interdisciplinary links and the \nresearch resource available, along with collaborations in Egypt, show good potential for \nfuture research and training in the field.   \n \nOverall the book provides a good overview of the state of research on Egyptian \nmummies, as seen from the Manchester perspective. Some of the (more technical) \nchapters will be less accessible to the general reader than others. The images supporting \neach chapter in general are useful for supplementing the text but sometimes are of poor \nquality and not very clear. At \u00a360\/$100 US (hardback), this seems a lot of money for a \nrather a small book. However, it will be of interest to scholars working in Egyptology in \ngeneral (students and established academics alike), to researchers working on mummified \nremains, and on Egyptian mummies in particular, to historians of medicine, and to \nmembers of the interested educated public. Studies of ancient Egypt, and its mummies in \nparticular, have always held an interest and fascination for many; this book will be no \nexception to that rule. \n \nCharlotte Roberts \nDepartment of Archaeology \nDurham University \n"}
