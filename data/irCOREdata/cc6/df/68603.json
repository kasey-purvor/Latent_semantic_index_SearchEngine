In the weak-noise limit the distribution is increasingly concentrated near a saddle point of the\ndynamics and is increasingly well approximated by a Weibull distribution, in agreement with theoretical\npredictions. A physical explanation for this behavior is given, which should facilitate the computation\nof corrections to the limiting form. [S0031-9007(99)08581-6]\nPACS numbers: 05.40.Ca, 02.50.\u2013r, 05.20.\u2013y, 07.50.EkA fundamental problem in the fluctuational dynamics of\nrandomly perturbed multistable systems is that of comput-\ning an exit location distribution, i.e., the probability dis-\ntribution of exit points on the boundary \u203aV of the domain\nof attraction V of a stable state. This problem appears\nin many areas of science and technology, e.g., in statisti-\ncal physics [1,2], chemical physics [3\u20135], fluid mechanics\n[6], ecology [7,8], and telecommunications [9,10].\nIn the familiar case of a noise-perturbed overdamped\nsystem in equilibrium, exit from the domain of attraction\nV preferentially takes place in the vicinity of a saddle\npoint of the deterministic (zero-noise) dynamics. In the\ntwo-dimensional case, the exit location distribution on \u203aV\ntypically converges in the limit of weak noise to a Gaussian\ncentered on the saddle point, whose width decreases with\nnoise intensity. Deviations from this behavior are of par-\nticular interest to the chemical physics community [3\u20135],\nbut are usually due to a comparatively large noise intensity\nand\/or anisotropic diffusion.\nMore recently, attention has focused on the problem\nof noise-induced exit in an overdamped, nonequilibrium\nsystem (e.g., one whose noise-free dynamics are noncon-\nservative, so that even in stationarity there is nonzero\nprobability current [11]). The boundary of the domain\nof attraction of a stable point may then contain no saddle\npoints. More typically, the boundary contains one or\nmore saddle points, and noise-induced exit tends to oc-\ncur preferentially in the vicinity of one of them. But the\nphenomenology of escape differs considerably from the\nequilibrium case [12,13]. In general, the exit location dis-\ntribution on \u203aV is now skewed: it no longer resembles a\nGaussian, even in the limit of weak noise [9,10,14\u201318].\nIn two-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, the skew-\ning behavior is largely determined by m \u00ad jlsjylu, the ra-\ntio of the stable and unstable eigenvalues of the linearized\ndeterministic dynamics at the saddle point [14\u201318]. The\nm , 1 case is particularly striking in that the exit location\ndistribution in the e ! 0 (weak-noise) limit, besides being0031-9007y99y82(9)y1806(4)$15.00skewed, is localized on a much broader length scale near\nthe saddle point than the Ose1y2d length scale that dimen-\nsional analysis would predict. Maier and Stein [15] have\nshown that if m , 1, Osemy2d is the correct length scale.\nThey have also predicted that as e ! 0, the exit location\ndistribution on \u203aV typically converges on this length scale\nto a Weibull, or \u201cstretched exponential\u201d distribution. It is\na one-sided distribution: In the weak-noise limit, the sys-\ntem state in most noise-perturbed nonequilibrium models\ntends to avoid the saddle point, by exiting from V a small\ndistance to one side of it. This is a more fundamental form\nof \u201csaddle-point avoidance\u201d than the type seen in conser-\nvative systems [5].\nDirect comparison with experiment has become desir-\nable. In this Letter we use analog and digital experiments\nto seek the predicted phenomenon of skewing, and we re-\nlate it to the geometry of the most probable escape path\n(MPEP) from the stable state to \u203aV, as it approaches the\nsaddle point. The anomalously broad exit location distri-\nbutions when m , 1 are predicted to have a simple physi-\ncal origin: the MPEP grazes \u203aV as it approaches the saddle\npoint [15]. (See, e.g., Fig. 1.)\nThe system we investigate is a bistable one: an\noverdamped particle moving in the symmetric, two-\ndimensional drift field\nusx, yd \u00ad fx 2 x3 2 axy2, 2mys1 1 x2dg , (1)\nwhere a and m are parameters [16]. This system has stable\npoints at s61, 0d, a separatrix or \u201cridge\u201d (i.e., \u203aV) along\nthe y axis, and a saddle point at s0, 0d.

First-quadrant MPEP (thick, solid line) for m \u00ad 0.66\nand a \u00ad 10, compared to a typical escape path (thin, jagged\nline) seen using analog simulation. The dashed rectangle\nrepresents the length scale near s0, 0d on which the exit location\ndistribution is localized for e \u00ad 0.016. Thin straight lines show\nseparatrix x \u00ad 0 and the other axis of symmetry y \u00ad 0.\nIn the language of chemical physics, x is a reaction coor-\ndinate, y is a nonreacting coordinate, and the half-planes\nx . 0 and x , 0 (in either order) correspond to the reac-\ntant and product wells. Since \u00d9x \u00f8 x and \u00d9y \u00f8 2my near\ns0, 0d, jlsjylu equals m.\nBecause of the symmetry through the x axis, for many\nchoices of parameters there are two MPEPs extending\nfrom each stable point to the saddle point s0, 0d [19].\nEach grazes the y axis, and together they yield a limiting\n\u201csymmetrized Weibull\u201d distribution on the y axis near\ny \u00ad 0. So, one-sidedness of the exit location distribution\nshould here be replaced by bimodality.\nTo test these predictions, we have built an analog elec-\ntronic model [20] of (2). We drive it with zero-mean quasi-\nwhite Gaussian noises from a noise generator, digitize the\nresponse xstd, ystd, and analyze it with a digital data pro-\ncessor. We have also carried out a complementary digi-\ntal simulation, using a high-speed pseudorandom generator\n[21] for the increments sDx, Dyd because simulation times\nnecessarily grow exponentially as e ! 0. In both analog\nand digital simulations, trajectories from the stable state\ns11, 0d to first crossings of the y axis were measured, and\nthe corresponding exit location distributions were built and\nanalyzed.\nOur theoretical prediction for the exit location distribu-\ntion was based on the following analysis. The phenome-\nnon of noise-induced exit in the e ! 0 limit is governed\nby the slowest decaying eigenmode r1sx, yd (quasista-\ntionary density) of the Fokker-Planck operator Le \u00ad\nsey2d=2 2 u ? = 2 = ? u corresponding to (2). The\nabsorption location density of this mode on the y axis de-\ntermines the exit location density pes yd. With increasing\naccuracy as e ! 0,\npes yd ~ \u203axr1s0, yd . (3)Our prediction for the exit location distribution relies\non an approximation to r1 that is increasingly valid as\ne ! 0. The approximation also yields predictions for the\nlimiting MPEPs. The appropriate tool for constructing\nthis approximation is the method of matched asymptotic\napproximations [7,22]. Away from the stable state and\nthe y axis, r1sx, yd should take on, to leading order, a\nWKB form const 3 expf2W sx, ydyeg. Near the saddle\npoint s0, 0d, this form should match an approximation of\nthe \u201cturning point\u201d type.\nThe eikonal function Wsx, yd of the WKB approxima-\ntion (also called a \u201cquasipotential\u201d [12]) has a classical-\nmechanical interpretation. For any point sx, yd in the\ndomain of attraction of either stable state, Wsx, yd is the\naction of the least-action zero-energy trajectory of an aux-\niliary Hamiltonian system that extends from the stable\nstate to sx, yd. The Hamiltonian function Hsx, pd for the\nauxiliary system is 12 p2 1 p ? usxd.\nThese zero-energy trajectories satisfy Hamilton\u2019s equa-\ntions, and are the most probable fluctuational trajectories\nof the noise-perturbed system. Such \u201coptimal\u201d trajectories\nare experimentally observable, and the momentum p can\nbe interpreted as the force applied by the noise [23\u201326].\nAccording to theory, MPEPs are simply optimal trajecto-\nries that extend to the saddle point.\nIn Fig. 1, the theoretically predicted MPEP of (2) in the\nfirst quadrant, with m \u00ad 0.66 and a \u00ad 10 (dotted curve),\nis compared with a typical escape path measured in the\nanalog electronic model of (2) ( jagged line). Three im-\nportant, closely related, features deserve comment: (i) for\nm , 1 the MPEP approaches the saddle point s0, 0d along\nthe y axis \u201cridge\u201d; (ii) the shape of the MPEP in a boundary\nlayer near the y axis, obtained by linearizing the Hamilton-\nian dynamics at s0, 0d, is close to y ~ xm; (iii) the measured\nescape path departs from the MPEP and crosses the y axis\nbefore reaching s0, 0d.\nBecause of small transverse fluctuations, the MPEP\nmay be viewed as being surrounded by a \u201cWKB tube\u201d\nwith an asymptotically (e ! 0) Gaussian profile of width\nOse1y2d (see, e.g., [13,23]). In a sense the WKB tube\nis formed from optimal trajectories that are perturbations\nof the MPEP, which are more or less followed during\nactual escape attempts. Because the MPEP grazes the y\naxis as it approaches s0, 0d, the escaping particle should\nwith overwhelming probability diffuse across \u203aV before it\nreaches the saddle point, as observed (Fig. 1). One expects\nthat the limiting exit location density will include a factor\nexps2const 3 y2ymyed, arising from the Gaussian profile\nof the WKB tube. The exponent here is proportional to\nthe square of the distance between the point s0, yd and the\nclosest point on the MPEP. One also expects the density\nto fall to zero as y ! 01.\nThe turning point approximation to the quasistationary\ndensity r1sx, yd that is valid near the saddle point s0, 0d\nturns out to be consistent with the expected behaviors. As\nnoted, this approximation must match the WKB form that1807\nVOLUME 82, NUMBER 9 PHY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 1 MARCH 1999is valid elsewhere. It must also satisfy the approximate\nFokker-Planck equation Ler1 \u00f8 0, with an absorbing\nboundary condition on the y axis. It should be symmetric\nin y, since there are two incomingWKB tubes, just as there\nare two incoming MPEPs: one from the first quadrant and\none from the fourth.\nWhen m , 1, the appropriate approximation to r1sx, yd\nnear s0, 0d is necessarily [15]\nr1sx, yd ~ j yjs1ymd21 sinhs2xj yyAj1ymyed\n3 exps2j yyAj2ymyed , (4)\nand it yields an exit location distribution of the above-\nmentioned symmetrized Weibull form,\npes yd dy ~ j yjs2ymd21 exps2j yyAj2ymyed dy . (5)\nHere the constant of proportionality is chosen to ensure\nunit total probability, and A is the constant that appears\nin the behavior of the MPEPs near the saddle point (i.e.,\ny \u00ad 6Axm). This distribution is localized on the Osemy2d\nlength scale and contains the expected Gaussian factor. It\nis also bimodal.\nClear experimental evidence for the predicted splitting\nof the exit location distribution can be seen in the analog\ndata of Fig. 2. It is evident that, for m . 1 [Fig. 2(a)]\nescape occurs on average through the saddle point (0, 0)\nwhereas, for m , 1 [Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)] it does not:\nthe bimodality of the exit location distribution is well\ndemonstrated. Significant rounding of the minimum of\npe at y \u00ad 0 where the theory predicts pe \u00ad 0 is evident,\nhowever, in Fig. 2(b). This can be attributed to the noise\nintensities used in the experiment: the chain of reasoning\nleading to (5) is valid only in the e ! 0 limit. The\nrounding becomes less pronounced as m and the angle\nof approach to the saddle decrease. The m \u00ad 0.2 curve\nof Fig. 2(c) already resembles a symmetrized Weibull\ndistribution.\n0\n2\n   (b)\n \np e\n0\n2\n4\n6\n   (a)\n \np e\n-0.8 -0.4 0 0.4 0.8\n0\n2\n   (c)\n \np e\n y\nFIG. 2.

Individual escape trajectories from\nthe x . 0 half-plane (Fig. 1) were selected according to\ntheir quadrants of origin and separately ensemble-averaged\nto build partial exit location distributions (whose sum\nobviously corresponds to the standard exit location dis-\ntribution). Each partial component should display one-\nsidedness, i.e., saddle-point avoidance, described by\npes yd ~\n\u2030 j yjs2ymd21 exps2j yyAj2ymyed, y $ 0 ;\n0, y , 0 ,\n(6)\ni.e., an unsymmetrized, one-sided Weibull density.\nPartial exit location distributions obtained by digital\nsimulation for small e are compared directly with the\nWeibull density (6) in Fig. 3. Agreement between theory\nand experiment is reasonable on the Osemy2d length scale\nand improves as e decreases. On a smaller length scale\nnear s0, 0d, some \u201crounding\u201d is evident as in Fig. 2, but it\ndecreases as e decreases.\nThere is a simple physical explanation of the limiting\nWeibull distribution, not dependent on the method of\nmatched asymptotic approximations, which can be refined\nto yield a prediction for the length scale on which rounding\noccurs. Since\n\u00d9x \u00f8 x 1 fxstd , (7)\n\u00d9y \u00f8 2my 1 fystd (8)\nnear s0, 0d, the x and y motions decouple. So exit through\nthe y axis is (in a sense) a one-dimensional activation phe-\nnomenon. Moreover, the figures show that y is typically\nmuch larger than x during an escape event, so to a first\napproximation fy may be disregarded.

The expected time to escape grows\nexponentially as e ! 0, but the duration of the final,\nsuccessful escape attempt grows only logarithmically. If\n\u00d9x \u00ad x near x \u00ad 0 when e \u00ad 0, the time for the particle\nto reach x \u00ad 0 in its final escape attempt will grow in the\ne ! 0 limit as 12 logs1yed 1 t, with\nPst # td \u00ad exps2e22td (9)\ndefining the cumulative distribution function of the com-\nparatively small random quantity t.\nTogether, y \u00ad y0e2mt and (9) imply that the exit loca-\ntion density on the y axis must be of the Weibull form (6),\nwith A ; y0. A slight refinement of y \u00ad y0e2mt yields a\nprediction for the rounding. Taking the force term fystd\ninto account turns y \u00ad ystd into an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess. The deterministic quantity y0e2mt must be re-\nplaced by a Gaussian random variable of mean y0e2mt and\nOse1y2d standard deviation, thus smearing out the Weibull\ndistribution on the Ose1y2d length scale, in qualitative\nagreement with the rounding in Figs. 2 and 3.
