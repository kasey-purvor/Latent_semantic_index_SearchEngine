This analysis synthesises relevant theoretical \napproaches. We then examine two field studies which feed into the development of \nthe task model.  \n \n \n \n1. Background \n \nThe past five years have seen a rapid growth in research, development and \ndeployment of mobile technologies to support learning. Although research in this \narea began with the seminal work of Kay and colleagues at Xerox PARC (Kay & \nGoldberg, 1997) it is only recently that both technology and educational needs have \nconverged. The new technology includes multimedia-equipped mobile phones, \npersonal digital assistants (PDAs) and pen tablet computers; the new emphasis in \neducation is on supporting the learner, in collaboration with peers and teachers, \nthrough a lifetime of education, both within and outside the classroom. This new area \nof personal mobile learning is distinctively different from learning within schools and \ncolleges, and from the traditional notion of continuing education, with its emphasis on \nequipping people with the skills and knowledge for a rapidly changing society. It also \nbrings with it a need to re-conceptualise the interaction between learning and the \ndesign of mobile technology. \n  \n2. General Aims  \n \nOur approach to understanding the domain of mobile learning begins by describing a \ndialectical approach to the development of a task model for mobile learning using the \nsocio-cognitive engineering design method (Sharples et al 2002) in the context of a \nlarge European funded project called MOBIlearn (IST-2001-37440). \n \nWe introduce the socio-cognitive engineering design method, highlighting the role of \nthe task model in systems design. The model is informed by general requirements, \ntheory and field studies. We describe the initial approach to the gathering of \nrequirements, which illuminated the need for a theoretical analysis of the sphere of \nactivity in mobile learning. This analysis attempts to synthesise relevant theoretical \napproaches, from socio-cultural and activity theory and from learning as \nconversation. We then examine some field studies which feed into the development \nof the task model. This leads us to a first articulation of the model.  Future field \nstudies will validate the model, and lead to its onward development.  \n \nThe process is described as dialectical because this first articulation of the model will \nbe used to inform the design of learning environments and tasks. As we evaluate the \neffectiveness of those designs, through field studies, we will feed our findings back \ninto the development and refinement of the task model. At the same time, though, \nthose learning experiences may shape and possibly change the ways that learners \nappropriate and use the technologies they have now been introduced to \u2013 i.e. \nexposure to technology may not leave users unaffected. Thus, the technology \nshapes user behaviour, and that behaviour in turn affects the way that users perceive \ntechnology. \n \nThis cyclic and dialectical process is the only way to fully capture the complexity of \nlearning in a mobile environment, particularly if we wish to ensure that we have fully \nunderstood how to create pedagogically sound activities for learners. To achieve this, \nwe will argue that there is a separation between the semiotics of a learning situation \n\u2013 in terms of the knowledge, language and conceptual resources needed for effective \nlearning \u2013 and the embodiment of these functionalities in specific devices or \nconstellations of devices. We also argue, along with others (e.g Sariola et al, 2001), \nthat the focus should be on the learner being mobile, rather than defining \u2018mobile \nlearning\u2019 as learning that takes place through the use of mobile devices.  \n \n \n3. The socio-cognitive engineering approach to systems \ndesign \n \nSocio-cognitive engineering (Sharples et al 2002) is a coherent approach to \ndescribing and analysing the complex interactions between people and computer-\nbased technology, so as to inform the design of socio-technical systems (technology \nin its social and organisational context). It extends previous work by providing an \nintegrated framework for socio-cognitive system design that incorporates software \nengineering, task engineering, knowledge engineering and organisational \nengineering. \nSocio-cognitive engineering has similarities to contextual design (Beyer & Holtzblatt, \n1998) in its approach of studying human activities and work practices in order to \nsupport them with new technology. Contextual design as formulated by Beyer and \nHoltzblatt is aimed at defining customer-centred systems that are based on a sound \nunderstanding work practices. Our aim is to define human-centred, socio-technical \nsystems (people in interaction with personal technology) that are based on a sound \nunderstanding of how people think, learn, perceive, work and interact. \n \nFigure 1 about here \n \n \nFigure 1 gives a picture of the flow and main products of the design process. It is in \ntwo main stages: a stage of activity analysis that sets constraints on the design and \nanalyses how people work and interact with their current tools and technologies; and \na stage of design of new technology. Our emphasis in this paper is on the first of \nthese, the activity analysis. \nThe activity analysis starts by specifying the general requirements and constraints for \nthe system to be designed. This sets out the type of activities to be supported by the \nnew technology (such as learning and knowledge management), the general domain \n(such as learning in a museum) and any general constraints (such as time and \nbudget available for the system design). This leads to two parallel studies, an \ninvestigation into how the activities are performed in their normal contexts, and a \nmore theory-based study of the underlying cognitive and social processes. The \noutcomes of these two studies are synthesised into a task model. The aim of the task \nmodel is to provide a coherent account of how the activities are performed, the \npeople involved, their contexts, the tools and technologies they employ, the structure \nof the tasks and an account of their cognitive processes, management of knowledge, \nand social interactions. \n \n3.1 The role and significance of the task model \n \nSharples et al (2002) point out that users are important sources of design information \nand may be partners in the design process. Interviews with users can illuminate \nproblems and breakdowns in their current work and technology, as well as \nmismatches between different viewpoints, such as teacher and student, or manager \nand employee. Users are often good at expressing preferences and choosing \nbetween competing products. They may often, but not always, be able to articulate \ntheir methods of working, the basis for decision making and the ways in which they \nstructure and deploy knowledge and skill. They may also provide a guide to language \nand terminology. \n \nBut, the authors suggest, users are not always reliable informants. They may idealize \ntheir methods, describing the ways in which they would like to or have been told to \nwork, rather than their actual practices. Although users may be able to describe their \nown styles and strategies, they may not be aware of how other people can perform \nthe task differently and possibly more effectively. Furthermore, basing design on a \nsurvey of user preferences can result in new technology that is simply an \naccumulation of features, rather than an integrated system. \nKey contributions of the socio-cognitive approach lie in the enriched view of users\u2019 \ntasks and the context of use, which allow us to integrate theoretical insights into \ncognitive processes underlying actions and activities. Importantly, the socio-cognitive \nmethod clearly distinguishes studying everyday activity using existing technology, \nfrom studying how the activity changes with proposed technology. It forces us to \nacknowledge the dialectical relationship between learners and artifacts \u2013 using \nartifacts changes the learner\u2019s activities, and this in turn affects the way the learner \nwants to use the artifacts. Learning is viewed as a distributed activity, so we will need \nto understand the range of actions and opportunities which are on offer to mobile \nlearners, and seek ways of extending this range to support what learners want to do \n\u2013 even if they themselves do not yet know what that is. \nAs mentioned earlier, Figure 1 shows that there are three important contributing \nstrands to constructing the task model \u2013 general requirements, a theory of use and \nfield studies. We now discuss each of these in turn. \n \n4. General Requirements \n \nGeneral requirements for a mobile learning environment were developed in a project \nfunded by the European Union, the MOBIlearn project (IST-2001-37440) through the \nuse of a scenario refinement process, more fully described elsewhere (Taylor and \nEvans 2005). The goal of the MOBIlearn project is to develop a pedagogically sound \nmobile learning environment.   We used scenarios in the project to fulfil a dual \nfunction.  The first was to assist in the process of \u2018envisionment\u2019 (Carroll, 1995) of the \nmobile learning environment, and to develop a shared understanding of its potential \nfor learning.  The second was to begin considering requirements to enable us to \nprogress towards the design of field studies. Of the many scenarios generated, 3 \nwere selected to be fully developed as test scenarios. \n \nThe next step was to refine these scenarios identifying what the basic requirements \nwere for mobile learning, and to pull out the common elements. This gave us a \ngeneral top-down view of the essential elements of a mobile learning environment, as \nidentified by informed experts, which we needed to augment by examining user \nbehaviour in context, to flesh out the detail in a bottom-up fashion. This method has \nmuch in common with the approach to scenario development described by Cugini et \nal (1999). The proposed scenarios were then calibrated, or grounded, by gathering \nuser data from learners and teachers within the context of the domain.  \n \n4.1 Requirements \nMany requirements emerged from the scenario refinement process (some 700), \nsome of them obvious and low level (e.g. devices which are meant to be portable \nneed to be light enough to carry; users need to be able to connect their devices to \nother devices). More interestingly, what emerged were three requirements for a \nmodel of learning that would serve the project: \n \n\u2022 Model Requirement A: the learning model needs to incorporate \nperspectives on group communication\/activities and the social dimension of learning. \n \n\u2022 Model Requirement B: the learning model must be able to describe \nexisting activities with current technologies, as well as new emergent activities as a \nresult of introducing new tools. \n \n\u2022 Model Requirement C: the learning model must provide a framework \nfor analysis of activities of learners and ways of understanding how activities relate to \ngoals. \n \nThese requirements set a target for the development of a learning model, and are a \nsummary of what teachers and learning technology experts felt was essential for a \nlearning model to address in the mobile domain. Model Requirement C  identifies the \nneed to be able to analyse activities, and relate them to goals. What are those \nactivities? \n \nThe second set of requirements addresses this question. The initial most important \nrequirements and common elements which emerged from all the scenarios with \nrespect to activities, or tasks that users want to perform, are: \n \n\u2022 Task Requirement 1: support for communication and collaboration \namongst actors (to include learners, teachers, resources, groups etc.) \n \n\u2022 Task Requirement 2: support for capturing information, annotation of \ndocuments or resources, personalisation of information and messaging, and all \nprocesses essential to learning (e.g. preparation, reflection, archiving etc.) \n \n\u2022 Task Requirement 3: awareness of the context in which activities \nare taking place, to include awareness of other devices in the environment, other \npeople and services \n \n\u2022 Task Requirement 4: immediate and seamless access to services, \nresources and people. \n \nThese general requirements were successively unpacked and refined to produce \nhundreds of specific requirements, too many to detail here. But it became clear that if \nwe were to achieve the goal of providing good pedagogical environments for \nlearning, we needed the theoretical input to create the model of learning in the mobile \nsetting which would adequately encompass the requirements.  We discuss this in the \nfollowing section. \n  \n5. A theory of use for mobile learning \n \nMost theories of pedagogy (as distinct from theories of learning) fail to capture the \ndistinctiveness of mobile learning. This is because they are theories of teaching, \npredicated on the assumption that learning occurs in a classroom environment, \nmediated by a trained teacher. Thus Watkins and Mortimore (1999) reviewed three \nphases of research literature on pedagogy, with a focus on: \n \n\u2022 different types of teachers, \n\u2022 the contexts of teaching, and \n\u2022 teaching and learning. \n \nIt is only the last that is of direct relevance to mobile learning. The second focus is \nimportant, but only with a shift in emphasis to the contexts of learning, rather than of \nteaching. Changing the focus from teaching to learning reveals a much broader \nhorizon of activity. \n \nLivingstone (2002) makes a useful distinction between internal and external initiation \nand structure of learning, shown in Figure 2. \n \n[Figure 2 about here] \n \nTraditional teaching is initiated by demands external to the learner, including the \ncurriculum and examination system, and structured by a classroom teacher.  \nLearning may be externally initiated, but structured by the learner, as in resource-\nbased learning where learners are encouraged to manage their own study, but within \nthe constraints of a curriculum. It may also be initiated by the learner, but externally \nstructured, for example in professional or personal development, where the learner \nopts to study in an evening class or coaching session. Lastly, learning may be both \ninitiated and structured by the learner. Vavoula (2004) has extended this \ncategorisation to include the process and object of learning, and who has control \nover it.  Her typology covers learning where the process is not prescribed and the \nobject is unspecified, as in unintentional informal learning \n \nSuch informal learning activity has been described as the \u201chidden iceberg\u201d of learning \n(Livingstone, 1999). Livingstone and colleagues questioned 1562 Canadian adults \nabout their informal learning activities. The study revealed the breadth of informal \nlearning. On average an adult spends 15 hours per week in informal learning, and \nthis was generally consistent across age and social class (apart from the 18-24 age \ngroup, which spent on average 23 hours per week in informal learning). It contrasted \nwith an average of about four hours per week of study in organised education \ncourses. \n \nAny theory of mobile learning must embrace the considerable learning that occurs \noutside the classroom and is personally initiated and structured. It must also account \nfor the dynamics of learning. Increasingly, we work away from our normal working \nenvironment, at home, on trains, in airport lounges. Such work includes both formal \nand informal learning (Waycott, 2004). Physical mobility is one aspect of the \ndynamics of learning. Others include a continually changing social environment and \naccess to resources, as we move in and out of communication with the Internet or \nother knowledge spaces, and as colleagues become available physically and online. \nWe shall use the term \u2018context\u2019 to refer to the combined physical, information and \nsocial setting of learning, which for mobile learning in particular is in continual \nchange. \n \nLastly, a relevant theory of learning must embrace contemporary accounts of the \npractices and ontogeny of learning. Learning is a constructive process, involving the \nactive construction of knowledge. It is a both a social and a cognitive activity, \noccurring within a rich milieu of physical and cultural tools, settings and social \ninteractions. And it comprises not only a process of continual personal development \nand enrichment, but also the possibility of rapid and radical conceptual change. \n \nThus, theories of learning must be tested against the following criteria:  \n \n\u2022 Do they account for both formal and informal learning?  \n\u2022 Do they analyse the dynamic context of learning?  \n\u2022 Do they theorise learning as a constructive and social activity? \n \nWe shall argue that no single current theory of learning satisfies these criteria \nentirely, but that two are particularly appropriate and complementary: these are post-\nVygotskian theories of mind, culture and activity as applied to learning; and theories \nof learning as conversation, developed by Pask and Laurillard. There is not the space \nhere to discuss these theories in depth, but fortunately both are thoroughly and \nelegantly expounded, by Daniels (2001) on Vygotsky and pedagogy, and Laurillard \n(2002) on learning as conversation. In this paper we shall only discuss how these \ncan contribute towards a task model for mobile learning. \n \n5.1 Sociocultural theories of learning \n \nSociocultural theory, and its near relation activity theory, derive from the work of \nVygotsky (1978), who attempted to describe learning and development as a process \nmediated by tools. The tools include both physical artefacts and semiotic constructs \nincluding language and society. In activity theory, the focus is on the activity itself, \nincluding the processes by which social, cultural and historical factors shape human \nfunctioning (Daniels, 2001). Vygotsky\u2019s original writings have been examined and \ndeveloped, initially by Russian academics including Leont\u2019ev and in recent years by \nWestern theorists including Cole, Wertsch and Engestr\u00f6m. Activity theory has been \napplied to the study of pedagogy, notably by Daniels (2001), and to the analysis and \ndesign of technology-mediated activity by Kuutti and others (e.g. Koschmann, Kuutti \nand Hickman, L. 1998; Virkkunen and Kuutti,2000; Tuikka and  Kuutti, 2000; Iacucci \nand Kuutti, 2002). \n \nEngestr\u00f6m proposes five principles of activity theory, that \u201cstand as a manifesto of \nthe current state of activity theory\u201d (Daniels, 2001). In summary, they are as follows: \n \n\u2022 Activity is the focus of analysis. Individual and group actions can \nonly be understood in relation to an interwoven system of activity. \n\u2022 Activity systems are multi-voiced. They include many perspectives, \ntraditions and interests which are in continual interaction and change, giving rise to \ninevitable conflict that demands analysis and resolution. \n\u2022 Activity systems are shaped over time.  Current activity can only be \nfully understood by taking a historical perspective, to understand how it has been \nshaped and transformed by previous ideas and practices. \n\u2022 Contradictions are sources of change and development. Activities \nare open systems, such that the introduction of new ideas and practices can cause \nconflict with existing ways of acting and describing. The process of resolving such \ntensions may lead to new understanding and thus to opportunities for change. \n\u2022 Activity systems contain the possibility for expansive transformation. \nThey go though extended periods of qualitative change, as the contradictions are \ninternalised and resolved, leading to the emergence of new structure, tools and \nactivity. \n \nSociocultural and activity theory provides a very different perspective on learning and \ndevelopment to previous theories of behaviour and mind. As a systems theory, it is \nsuited to the analysis of collective behaviour, such as a classroom or workplace, but \nit has also been applied to the analysis of the individual learner. Vygotsky proposed \nthe Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) as a way to understand the contradictions \nbetween a learner\u2019s personal understanding and the external opportunities afforded \nby teachers and peers. By working within the region between what a learner can \ncurrently achieve unaided, and what is possible with outside support, a teacher can \ncontinually help the child to strive and develop. \n \nActivity theory provides a framework to analyse the mediating role of new technology \nin activity of learning, and the inevitable contradictions that arise from introducing \nnew technology into an environment such as a classroom or workplace.  \n \nIn recent years, the original formulation by Vygotsky of the relations between a \nsubject, such as a learner, an object (\u201cobjective\u201d is a more accurate translation of the \nRussian), such as a course of study, and tool, such as a teacher or a text, has been \nexpanded by Engestr\u00f6m (1987) into a generalised activity system that also includes \nrules, community, and division of labour (see Figure 3). This expansive activity model \nis a powerful analytic tool that has been applied to the understanding of practice in \nclassrooms and workplaces.  \n[Insert Figure 3 about here] \n \nThe introduction and appropriation of technology is itself an activity system, and so \ncan be analysed with the tools of activity theory. Waycott (2004) has applied \nEngestr\u00f6m\u2019s expansive model to the process of appropriating wireless technology for \nlearning and knowledge working. Waycott derives a model of the Tool Integration \nProcedure (discussed further below) which illustrates how new tools can resolve \ncontradictions in the tool user\u2019s activity, but also how such  tools can also introduce \ncontradictions of their own. \n \nHowever, the very benefits of the expanded activity model are also its limitations. By \nfocusing on particular elements of the activity system, and on activity itself, the model \ninevitably de-emphasises other aspects that may be important to a full understanding \nof the processes of learning and of technology appropriation. Returning to \nEngestr\u00f6m\u2019s five principles, we would suggest that they fail to give sufficient \nemphasis to the following: \n \n\u2022 Learning is conversation. All learning is a process of internal \nconversation with oneself, to understand new phenomena and resolve internal \ncontradictions, and external conversation with peers, with teachers, and nowadays \nwith interactive artefacts such as computers. The role of conversation has been \nextensively analysed by Sociocultural theorists such as Bakhtin (1999) and more \nrecently by Heath and Luff (1982), but, as Daniels (2001) points out, although \nEngestr\u00f6m\u2019s work addresses the production of the outcome, he does not discuss the \nproduction and structure of the tool itself. There is, therefore, a resulting \u201c\u2026lack of \ntheory of structure of discourse as a cultural artefact\u201d (Daniels, 2001, p. 135). \n \n\u2022 Activities are contextual. All activity is performed in contexts, and \nthese are historic constructs. Cole (1996) makes an important distinction between \ncontext as \u201cthat which surrounds us\u201d and context as \u201cthat which weaves together\u201d. \nActivity is not only occurring in a context, but it also creates context through continual \ninteraction and change. Engestr\u00f6m certainly describes the characteristics of activity \ntheory as \u2018contextual and oriented at understanding historically specific local \npractices, their objects, mediating artifacts, and social organization\u2019 (Engestr\u00f6m, \n1996). The expansive activity theory sets activity within a social and cultural context, \nbut does not sufficiently theorise about the nature of context \u2013 for example contexts \nas historic constructs. Engestr\u00f6m (1993) points out the danger of the relative under-\ntheorising of context: \u2018Individual experience is described and analysed as if \nconsisting of relatively discrete and situated actions while the system or objectively \ngiven context of which those actions are a part is either treated as an immutable \ngiven or barely described at all.\u2019 \n \n\u2022 An activity system can understand itself. Human activity systems are \nreflexive; they have the possibility to analyse themselves, and through self-\nexamination to reveal contradiction and to deliberately explore future paths without \nactually following them. This ability to hypothesise and predict is an essential aspect \nof any system that learns through introspection and self-awareness. We haven\u2019t \nspace for a detailed discussion of this issue, but note Giddens\u2019 (1984) comment:  \n\u2018Human social activities, like some self-reproducing items in nature, are recursive. .. \nthey are not brought into being by social actors but continually recreated by them via \nthe means whereby they express themselves as actors. In and through their activities \nagents reproduce the conditions that make these activities possible.\u2019  \n \nThus, we suggest that sociocultural and activity theory, while providing a powerful \nanalytic tool has its limitations. For the purposes of developing the Task Model, we \nhave also explored an alternative theory of learning, Conversation Theory. It is a \nsimilarly extensive framework for analysing and designing the practices of learning \nand, like activity theory, it takes a systems perspective. It differs in that its prime \nfocus is conversation, not activity. \n \n5.2 A Theory of Learning as Conversation \n \nAn encompassing theory of learning based on conversation is Pask\u2019s Conversation \nTheory (Pask 1976).  It derives from cybernetics, the study of communication and \ncontrol in natural and artificial systems, and its more recent extension to second \norder cybernetics, the study of the mechanisms by which a system can understand \nitself. The relevance to our Task Model is in its view of learning as a process of \n\u201ccoming to know\u201d, by which learners in cooperation with peers and teachers, \nconstruct an interpretation of their world. This \u2018radical constructivism\u2019 (von Glaserfeld, \n1984) extends the notion of learning as a constructive process beyond the individual \nto describe how organisations, communities and cultures learn and develop. The \ngeneral approach makes no distinction between people and interactive systems such \nas computers, with the great advantage that the theory can be applied equally to \nhuman teachers and learners, or to technology-based teaching or learning support \nsystems. \n \nConversation Theory describes learning in terms of conversations between different \nsystems of knowledge. In order to constitute a \u2018conversation\u2019, the learner must be \nable to formulate a description of himself and his actions, explore and extend that \ndescription and carry forward the understanding to a future activity.  In order to learn, \na person or system must be able to converse with itself about what it knows. \n \nLearning can be even more effective when learners can converse with each other, by \ninterrogating and sharing their descriptions of the world.  We can say that the two \npeople share an understanding if Person A can make sense of B\u2019s explanations of \nwhat B knows, and person B can make sense of A\u2019s explanation of what A knows. \nThus, it is through mutual conversation that we come to a shared understanding of \nthe world.  Learning is a continual conversation: with the external world and its \nartefacts, with oneself, and also with other learners and teachers. The most \nsuccessful learning comes when the learner is in control of the activity, able to test \nideas by performing experiments, ask questions, collaborate with other people, seek \nout new knowledge, and plan new actions.  \n \nLaurillard (2002) relates Pask\u2019s theory to the realm of academic knowledge.  Though \nprimarily concerned with the application of educational technology to university-level \nteaching, the \u2018conversational framework\u2019 she puts forward can be applied to the full \nrange of subject areas and topic types.   The learning process includes the following \naspects: apprehending structure, integrating parts, acting on descriptions, using \nfeedback and reflecting on goal-action-feedback.  As illustrated in Figure 4, \ntechnology may play multiple roles within the conversation space. \n \n[Insert Figure 4 about here] \n \nTechnology may take the place of the teacher, as in drill and feedback. The difficulty \nhere is that the computer can hold a limited dialogue at the level of actions: \u201clook \nhere\u201d; \u201cwhat\u2019s this?\u201d; \u201cdo that\u201d, but is not able to reflect on its own activities or its own \nknowledge. Although some systems have been developed which attempt to model \nthe student, and to tailor feedback to the perceived student needs, the computer is \nnot engaging in developing a shared understanding. And because it cannot hold a \nconversation at the level of descriptions, it has no way of exploring students\u2019 \nmisconceptions or helping them to reach a shared understanding.  \n \nTechnology can also demonstrate ideas or offer advice at the level of descriptions, as \nwith the worldwide web or online help systems, but their practical advice, at the level \nof actions, is limited. \n \nAlternatively, the technology may provide the environment in which conversational \nlearning takes place. It can extend the range of activities and the reach of a \ndiscussion, into other worlds through games, and to other parts of this world by \nmobile phone or email. The technology provides a shared conversational learning \nspace, which can be used not only for single learners but also for groups of learners.  \n \nActivity theory and conversation theory complement each other in their analytic \npower and focus. Whereas activity theory can provide an analysis of activity systems \nsuch as classrooms, workplaces and learning communities, conversation theory \nilluminates the process of coming to know, as a continual conversation with oneself, \nwith other people and with interactive technology.  \n \nThe theory of use, then, supports the general principle that communication and \ncollaboration lies at the heart of an effective pedagogy for mobile learning \nenvironments.   \n \n6. Field Studies \n \nWe now turn to two field studies to understand learning in practice, and how efforts to \nlearn are either supported or impeded by technology. As we pursue this line of \nanalysis, the dialectical relationship between tools and tasks (i.e.  how they mutually \nshape each other) becomes very evident. Both studies have been undertaken using \nqualitative methods of enquiry. \n \nThe first, (Waycott, 2004 ) is based on field studies in the workplace, and  describes \nhow handheld computers (PDAs) have been adopted as general purpose tools, and \nexamines the related processes of appropriating new tools and shaping existing \nactivities through the use of new technologies. Her central focus is upon the shaping \neffects of tools on behaviour and vice versa. In the second study, we report ongoing \nwork, conducted by Vavoula as part of the MOBIlearn project, analysing people\u2019s \nlearning behaviour in mobile settings. \n \n6.1 Handheld computers and appropriation \nWaycott (2004) develops an account, based within Activity Theory, of the dialectical \nprocess of technology appropriation and the shaping effect of technology on \n \nindividuals and their social environment observed in her field studies. The term \n\u2018appropriation\u2019 is defined as the integration of a new technology into the user\u2019s \nactivities, and Waycott emphasises that this is an active process, greatly influenced \nby the user\u2019s prior experience and expectations. \n \nSome of the participants in Waycott\u2019s studies found that their PDAs provided an \nexact match to existing activity. For instance, someone who had secretarial training \nand had learnt shorthand found the use of the stylus very natural. Another regarded \nthe use of the PDA as taking bits of the computer with them as they moved around \nthe workplace, whilst another saw the value in taking meeting notes on the PDA (and \ntherefore in electronic form) and transferring these directly to the desktop to form the \nbasis of the document to be produced. On the other hand, unsurprisingly, other \npeople found the small screen and awkward input methods too much to cope with, so \nlimiting the usefulness of the device. \n \nIn a study of mobile workers who spent a great deal of their time travelling abroad on \ncompany business, Waycott identifies their needs in terms of support for aspects of \ntheir working life. These workers needed to keep their \u2018office persona\u2019 intact whilst \naway from the company HQ, so continuous access to such tools as email, diaries \nand word processors (to access and create documentation) was crucial. This group \nfound themselves in frequent conflict between their devices, which consisted of \nlaptops, desktops, and PDAs. The diary function was acknowledged to be very \nconvenient handled through the PDA, but this sometimes caused problems in \nsynchronisation failure.  \n \nFollowing this study, Waycott introduces the Tool Integration Process to describe \nintegration of new technologies  into everyday activity (see Figure 5). \n[Insert Figure 5 about here] \nThe figure illustrates considerations that need to be taken into account in the \nintegration and appropriation process. Failure to appropriate can occur due to \nconstraints of the device itself \u2013 a fairly simple case. Alternatively, breakdowns can \noccur between user expectations of the device and what it can actually deliver \n(Bodker, 1991). Otherwise, the tool is adapted to suit the user\u2019s activity, or new \nactions\/operations are developed to fit with the tool and, consequently, use of the \nnew tool may resolve contradictions in the user\u2019s activity system. \n \n6.2 Field Studies of Mobile Learners \n \nAs part of the field studies for MOBIlearn, Vavoula has been looking at existing \npractices of informal, everyday learning, including instances of mobile learning. The \naim of the study is to uncover how people learn on the move or outside their normal \nlearning environment, with their currently available technologies. A diary-based \nmethod has been adopted for the purposes of the study. Participants are asked to \nkeep track of their everyday learning episodes, making notes at the end of each day \nabout the contexts where learning happened, the activities they performed, the \nobjects they used, the people they interacted with, etc. The participants are briefed \nthat learning episodes are: \n\u201coccasions in the day where you feel you have learned something, some new \nknowledge or skill, or you have increased or deepened your understanding on a \ntopic. This could be learning in any form: through formal classes and training \nsessions; during casual visits to places like museums, galleries and theatres; \nduring informal meetings with friends; during travelling; etc. Please keep in mind \nthat we are interested in all the different sorts of learning that you do in your \neveryday life and remember to put equal emphasis on both work-related learning, \nand learning that relates to hobby, leisure or community work\u201d \nThe diary study is ongoing at the time of writing; however, we can report some \npreliminary results. \n \nFor the purposes of this study, we classify learning episodes that take place in our \nown space at the workplace, or at our home, as non-mobile (these are normally our \nfamiliar learning sites); then learning that happens elsewhere (other location at the \nworkplace, places of leisure, friends\u2019 houses, outdoors) is taken to be mobile. There \nwas an equal split between the reported episodes in the two categories. \n \nMany similarities hold between mobile and non-mobile learning episodes: they both \ntake place during the same range of events and at all times during the day, and are \nof varying lengths with longer episodes taking place in the mornings and afternoons \nwhile shorter ones dominate the evenings; they both involve the performance of a \nnumber of activities (typically up to three) and a number of learning objects (typically \nup to four); they both relate to various areas in life, such as work, housework, \nhobbies and community work; they both involve interactions with other people such \nas family, friends, colleagues, but also strangers and people from the media who are \nnot directly involved in the learning.  \n \nPoints of interest in the findings are the following: \n \n\u2022 Web surfing and telephone calls are listed as events during which \nlearning takes place. This cannot but be an indication of the incidental nature of \nsome learning episodes. \n\u2022 Most learning episodes (70%) last up to an hour. Surprisingly \nperhaps, short episodes (up to half an hour) are more often reported in non-mobile \nthan in mobile cases, it therefore would not make sense to assume that mobile \nmeans quick. \n\u2022 The most popular learning activities are discussion, reading, note-\ntaking, information search, and reflection. Note-taking, discussions, observations, \nproblem-solving, and collaboration were reported more often in mobile than in non-\nmobile settings. Some activities, then, are more likely to take place in a mobile \nsetting than others. \n\u2022 The most popular learning objects are the contents of conversations, \nand paper-based and electronic documents. The contents of conversations are used \ntwice as often in mobile settings than in non-mobile. Again then, some objects are \nmore likely to be found in mobile settings than others. \n \nOur initial findings, therefore, do not demonstrate a clear and obvious split between \nlearning supported in non-mobile settings, and learning supported by mobile devices \n\u2013 the situation is more subtle than that.  \n \nThus, from the field studies discussed here, we articulate the central concept of our \nview of mobile learning which is that: \n \n\u2022 there is a clear separation between required functionalities and \ntheir embodiment in any specific technology.  \n \nIn other words, in a work situation or a learning situation, people know what kinds of \nfunctionalities (resources for learning) they would like around them to be effective, \nand will seek these out as and when they need them. \n \nWe also adopt the view of mobile learning expressed by other authors which is that: \n \n\u2022 it is the people that are defined as \u2018mobile\u2019, not the devices \naround them.  \n \nFor example, Sariola et al (2001) suggest that a technology-based definition of \nmobile learning is not sufficient \u2013 i.e. defining mobile learning as that learning which \ntakes place through the use of mobile devices does not have educational relevance \nper se. The issue, rather, is that mobile learning is defined by virtue of the fact that it \nis the learner who is mobile, and is not defined by the devices they choose to use. In \nthis sense, books are archetypal mobile learning devices that we have used for \ncenturies. Defining mobile learning as that which takes place through the use of \nmobile devices also has serious limitations in terms of allowing us to understand how \nto construct a pedagogically sound mobile environment for at least two reasons. \nFirstly, sound pedagogy is not tied to specific devices \u2013 a pedagogical strategy can \nbe expressed technically in many different ways, and we would suggest that \npedagogically inappropriate uses of mobile devices is a confounding factor for many \nstudies. Secondly, technical developments in mobile devices are sufficiently rapid \nthat focusing our analysis around the use of existing tools is bound to limit our \nunderstanding and render studies almost immediately redundant as technical \ninnovation proceeds apace. \n \nPeople may or may not carry mobile devices with them \u2013 any device represents an \nembodiment of some of the functionalities a person needs, no more, no less. Mobile \ndevices, such as PDAs, can be used in some very non-mobile activities \u2013 e.g. sitting \nat a desk in my office looking at web pages. Similarly a user may choose to use a \nmobile telephone in preference to a standard phone because the user\u2019s phone book \nis on her mobile, and it is easier to look up and dial via that than using the keys to \nenter the number on the standard phone. Or an office worker abroad may visit an \ninternet caf\u00e9 in preference to trying to connect a laptop in a hotel. The functionalities \nfit the need to work or learn on the move rather than desire for a particular \ntechnology. However, interaction between technology and activity is important, since \nit constrains or affords particular operations. A mobile phone may not afford web \nbrowsing, or an internet caf\u00e9 may not offer access to a personal contacts list.  \n \nAnd as ambient and ubiquitous computing becomes a familiar part of our \nenvironment, we can assume that the routes for access to our mental workspace \nbecome easier and more readily available \u2018anywhere, any time\u2019 \u2013 or even \n\u2018everywhere, anytime\u2019.1 \n \n7. The Task Model \n \nOur discussion so far has led us now to the introduction of the task model itself. We \nhave discussed the idea that there are two spaces within which learners move \u2013 the \nmental  space which consists of required, or preferred, functionalities, and the space \nof possible actual embodiments of those functionalities in the form of devices.  There \nis a dialectic between these two spaces \u2013 as the learner sees a device that has a \ngood match to their requirements, she may choose to appropriate that technology \nand in so doing, integrate it into her activities, which will be shaped by that device. \nWaycott\u2019s tool integration procedure (Figure 5)  illustrates this process.  \n \nSo we can see that there must be a dialectical relationship between the technological \nspace, and the more abstract semiotic \u2018learn-space\u2019. A learner enters the task of \n                                               \n1 In this discussion we are deliberately ignoring issues of privacy and security because the conclusions \nwill be a theoretical description of mobile activities. In reality, many practical limitations will impinge \nupon this space of activities, but resolving those are not our concern at the present time. \nlearning with an objective \u2013 to augment knowledge and skills they may or may not \nalready posses, and the output from this activity is a new set of knowledge and skills. \nBut several other important factors impinge on this rather simplified process, and in \nour view, these other factors share the same dialectical relationship between a \ntechnological (or physical) domain, and a more abstract human, social \u2013 or as we \ndescribe it semiotic -  domain. Adapting  Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s Expanded Activity System, this \ncan be represented as an activity system as depicted in Figure 6. \n[Insert Figure 6 about here] \n \nThe influencing factors are identified as Control, Context and Communication, which \nare adaptations of Engestr\u00f6m\u2019s original \u2018Rules, Community and Division of Labour\u2019. \nThis adaptation enables the diagram to capture the two spaces (technological and \nsemiotic) and illustrates points at which the dialectic works. We believe that this \nrelationship has not been fully explored in studies of learners to date, but that it must \nbe accounted for by any theory of technology augmented learning to understand how \npeople adopt, adapt and use technology. \n \n7.1 Control \n \nWe know that putting learners in control of their learning is one of the much vaunted \nbenefits of technology enhanced learning (e.g. see Laurillard 2002). To a certain \nextent  this is a technological benefit which derives from the way in which learning is \ndelivered \u2013 if the learners can access materials as and when convenient, they can \nwork through the materials at their own speed, revising and re-checking as they wish. \nThis benefit can be lost, however, if the application is not useable \u2013 i.e. the user \ninterfaces must be effective and fit for purpose, and expectations of the system\u2019s \nperformance must be met. \n \nHowever, technology use occurs within a social system of other users, and people \ncan be easily influenced not only by what other users are actually doing, but also how \nthey feel about it. Social rules govern what is acceptable (e.g. how to use e-mail, who \nis allowed to email whom, what kinds of document format should be used etc).  The \nuser\u2019s attitudes to technology can be influenced by what people around them think \nabout it \u2013 i.e. are people resentful at having to use the technology, or are they keen \nand eager to try it out?  And individuals can also express informal rules which \ncapture the way they like to do things (e.g. never leaving documents on the desktop, \nbut always filing them). \n \n7.2 Context \nThe context in which learning takes place is clearly a significant factor, but the term \nhas many connotations for different theorists. In the Task Model, we aim to pin down \ntwo important aspects of context \u2013 the physically embodied technological context, \nand the human, semiotic context (i.e. the community) within which learning takes \nplace. We mention above the kinds of social rules that serve to control what users \nare likely to do. This node refers to how it is done. The community may consist of \nmany related co-workers or co-learners who may or may not share the same current \n\u2018object\u2019 or objective, but may play a large part in what an individual may like to do. \n  \n7.3 Communication \nThe dialectical relationship between the technological and semiotic worlds is perhaps \nthe easiest to see in the Communication node \u2013 if the system enables certain forms \nof communication, learners can adapt their communication behaviours accordingly, \nand sometimes find ways to subvert the technology (e.g. finding novel ways of \nconnecting across networks). There have been many studies of the use of text-based \ncommunication as a substitute for live conversation (e.g. email, computer \nconferencing) \u2013 such communication is not the same as face to face discussion. But \nas has been demonstrated in the use of SMS text messaging with mobile phones, \nparticularly by younger generations of users, if people see an opportunity offered by \na device that they can exploit, then they will take it, regardless of the usability \naspects involved. The perhaps surprising popularity of texting, in turn, has \nencouraged mobile phone designers to develop tools to support it (e.g. predictive \ntext), so the dialectic rolls on. \n \n7.4 Summary \n \nAs pointed out earlier, the aim of the task model is to provide a coherent account of \nhow the activities are performed, the people involved, their contexts, the tools and \ntechnologies they employ, the structure of the tasks and an account of their cognitive \nprocesses, management of knowledge, and social interactions. This is necessarily a \ncomplex exercise, which relies on drawing together the three strands of information \nfrom theory, field studies and requirements. These are all mutually supporting, and \nthe task model aims to hold all these elements in tension so that attention does not \nfocus on one area to the exclusion of the others. Nevertheless, our current \narticulation is not considered to be complete. We have yet to consider more fully how \nto take into account the temporal element, and for that we still need something like \nConversation Theory as a systems account of the process of coming to know. For \nthe time being, Figure 4 appropriately captures this aspect. \n \nThe task model is not itself prescriptive (e.g. what contexts are important for what \ntypes of learning) nor do the elements need to be explicitly modelled in the \ntechnology (e.g. whether the technology should contain a computational model of the \nlearner, or of the context). But these lower level considerations can now be explored \nthrough case studies, and further empirical work, to illuminate the model further. \n \n \n8. Dialectical relations between Task Model and System \nDesigns \n \nThe main purpose of the task model is not to create a hierarchical analysis of the \ntask structure or to model of the mental states and operations of the principal actors \n(though it might include both of these), but to describe the interactions between the \npeople and their tools and resources, and to analyse how people externalise their \nwork, through representations such as notes and diagrams, the rules and \nconventions that influence the activity, and the terminology and patterns of discourse. \n \nThe task model provides the bridge to a cycle of iterative design that includes: \nspecifying a design concept; generating a space of possible system designs; \nspecifying the functional and non-functional aspects of the system; implementing and \ndeploying the system. Testing is an integral part of the design process, with the \nresults of the evaluation being fed forwards to provide an understanding of how to \ndeploy and implement the system, and backwards to assist in fixing bugs and \nimproving the design choices. Although this stage is based on a conventional \nprocess of interactive systems design (see Newman & Lamming, 1995), it gives \nequal emphasis to cognitive and organisational factors as well as task and software \nspecifications. \n \nThe result of the process is a new socio-technical system consisting of new \ntechnology and its associated documentation and proposed methods of use. When \nthis is deployed, in the workplace, home, or other location it will not only produce \nbugs and limitations that need to be addressed, but also engender new patterns of \nwork and social and organisational structures. These become contexts for further \nanalysis and design. \n \nIn terms of the MOBIlearn project, the use of the model enables us to capture the \nmyriad possible interactions that learners may engage in as they roam around their \nrespective environments, picking up and using devices as they go. Each of the three \ntest scenarios can now be mapped onto the model, instantiating each of the nodes, \nand encapsulating the learners, their objectives, their context and their tasks.  \n \nThe great advantage of this development is that the various scenarios can be \ninstantiated according to the requirements, and this provides both a common \nstructure, but also an individualised representation of each. From a design point of \nview, the MOBIlearn system can be considered successful if it enables all of these \nactivities using a multiplicity of devices in different contexts. \n \nThus, we are able to provide structure to an enormously complex learning situation, \nwhich, from a design point of view, would otherwise be very difficult to engage with. \nThis view also helps emphasise to the design team that designing strictly to one set \nof requirements from one scenario is likely to exclude the needs of other learners at \nother times. The use of the task model, however, keeps the overall needs to the fore. \nThe pedagogic experts can also maintain a view of the components of the system \nwhich bear upon the space of possible activities \u2013 i.e. it is of little use specifying that \nlearners must have access to wireless networks if there are none in the environment. \nWe set out to describe our approach to understanding the domain of mobile learning \nwith a theoretical position that was rich enough to capture the complexity of the \nlearners\u2019 activities and the contexts in which they occur. We believe that the \nproposed task model is a first step in this direction. Refinements will occur as field \nstudies are conducted, and as new user requirements emerge. However, this model \nprovides us with a research agenda for our developing work \u2013 we need to explore \neach of the dialectic relationships identified, clarifying and elaborating the activities \npeople engage in, and how those can be optimised to support mobile learners of the \nfuture.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements: \nWe would like to acknowledge the European Union for financial support through the \nMOBIlearn project IST-2001-37440 . \n \n \n \n9.
