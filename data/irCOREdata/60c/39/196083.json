I particularly \nacknowledge the contribution made to the research reported in this paper by \nChristopher Pole and Sharon Boden, and, of course, to the children and their families. \nThis paper was written during a period of study leave granted by the University of \nLeicester. \n \n 1 \nWhat Not to Wear? Girls, Clothing and \u2018Showing\u2019 the Body  \nExisting literature largely fails to illuminate children's experiences and practices in relation \nto consumption (Martens, Southerton and Scott 2004), and especially in relation to clothing \n(although see Cook 2004; Cahill 1989; Russell and Tyler 2002; Swain 2002).  There are \nemerging trends in late modern societies which now encourage academics to pay greater \nattention to the socio-cultural significance of children\u2019s clothing consumption. The market \nin children\u2019s clothing is considerable and growing (including in terms of designer labels), \ndespite the falling birth rate (Aldridge 2004; Cook and Kaiser 2004; Euromonitor PLC \n2004; Mintel 2003). It is in this context of expansion in the children\u2019s fashion market that \nthe term 'tweenager' developed (Cook and Kaiser 2004; see also Johansson 2004). The term \ndescribes children aged between about eight and 12, especially girls, who are of interest to \nbusinesses because of their significant spending power on the High Street. The targeting of \nchildren by business and marketing along with children\u2019s own consumption of clothing as \nfashion, particularly if this is seen to \u2018sexualise\u2019 girls bodies, has been interpreted popularly \nas \u2018damaging\u2019 to childhood as a social institution. Although coming from quite different \nperspectives, there are some similarities between publicly voiced concerns about the \nsexualisation of feminine childhood through fashion and what can be described as academic \n\u2018postmodern consumption\u2019 perspectives, in that both allude to fashion\u2019s role in the \nweakening of the previously established generational boundaries between adulthood and \nchildhood (Ash and Wilson 1993; Maffesoli 1996). However, Sweetman (2001: 73) is \namong several authors who criticise the idea of fashion cultures as a free floating \u2018carnival \nof signs\u2019, easily adopted and readily discarded, and who insist that fashion is at least partly \nstructured by such statuses as age, stage in life course, and gender (Craik 1994; Edwards \n2000; Kaiser 2001; Russell and Tyler 2002).  \n \n \n 2 \nImportantly, though trends in clothing fashions can only provide the broad context within \nwhich consumers (including children) exercise agency. The meanings of girls\u2019 encounters \nwith controversial clothing fashion should not be \u2018read off\u2019 from market trends, or from \nmedia debates or the concerns of parents. Instead, they need exploring through an \nengagement with girls\u2019 everyday practices of clothing consumption.  \n \nMethodology \nIt is these concerns that have influenced the approach taken in the wider study of children, \nconsumption and fashion, of which this paper is a part. Following focus group interviews \nwith parents, fieldwork was undertaken in England in 2003-4 with eight families. Each \nfamily contained at least one child between the ages of six to 11, whose consumption of \nchildren\u2019s clothing was tracked over a calendar year. The families were selected in \naccordance with well-established sociological methodologies (for example, Hammersley \nand Atkinson 1995), not to be representative of families in England in any statistical sense, \nbut to be illustrative of key social variables, including income level, gender and ethnicity, \nurban and rural location. Data collection methods sought to place children at the centre of \nthe research (Pole et al 1999) via deploying a range of participatory methods. Along with \nsemi-structured interviews with and diary-work by parents, the methods collectively aimed \nto provide insight into the role of children as consumers of clothing within the context of \ndifferent kinds of families across a full year. The study aimed to address gaps in existing \nknowledge about children\u2019s consumption of clothing, including for example, children\u2019s \nunderstandings and interpretations in respect of their own bodies, its mediation through \ngenerational relations in the household, and through peer relations, and the role it plays in \ncontributing to children\u2019s experiences of social inclusion and exclusion. In order to provide \nan insight into the interconnected nature of children\u2019s consumption of clothing with its \n 3 \nproduction, interviews were held with personnel in the children\u2019s wear industry, including \nstore buyers and other executive decision makers.  \n \nData presented in this paper are drawn from seven girls aged between 5 and 12, each of \nwhom participated in five fieldwork visits and related project work over the course of a year. \nAll of the seven girls featured in this paper were white\n1\n, and attended state schools. Data \ndrawn from fieldwork visits with one girl, Hayley \n2\n (aged 8), feature especially prominently \nin the paper. Of all the 28 children in the wider study, Hayley, was by far the most articulate \nin her interviews, writing and photographic project-work about her experiences and \nunderstandings of her consumption of clothing. As with other qualitative studies based on \nsmall samples, my intention is not to generalise from the experiences of Hayley or the other \ngirls in our study to those of all girls, nor to develop from their experiences all-\nencompassing theories of gendered childhoods, clothing and consumption. Rather, my aim \nin this paper is to examine the meanings of \u2018controversial\u2019 clothing fashions for the girls in \nour study and to suggest ways in which their understandings and experiences can inform, \nalbeit in modest and provisional ways, both popular and sociological debates about the \n\u2018erosion\u2019 of gendered, generational boundaries in late modern societies. Accordingly, in the \nfollowing section, I use data from the wider study to explore the meanings the girls \nthemselves gave to controversial clothing fashions, both in relation to their own bodies and \nto those of others. In drawing upon key themes arising from the literature in the \nconsumption of clothing and on the sociology of childhood reviewed earlier, the following \nquestions are addressed. For the girls in our study, is \u2018dressing up\u2019 in controversial clothing \nabout the \u2018innocent\u2019 pleasures of play, the \u2018otherness\u2019 of children\u2019s \u2018tribal culture\u2019 (James, \nJenks and Prout 1998)? Or does it represent a more, reflexive \u2018knowing\u2019 engagement with \nfashion (McRobbie and Nava 1984) in order to \u2018age up\u2019 (Hockey and James 1993) toward a \nparticular, overtly sexual model, of feminine adulthood (Cook and Kaiser 2004)? How is the \n 4 \ngirls\u2019 consumption of contested clothing shaped by the influence of peers (Elliot and \nLeonard 2004) and by negotiations with their parents (Prout 2000)? What are the girls\u2019 \nunderstandings of the symbolic character of clothing (Entwhistle and Wilson 2001; Cahill \n1989), including in terms of the contextual \u2018presentation of self\u2019 and body (Goffman 1969; \nJames, Jenks and Prout 1998; Prout 2000)?  \n \n\u2018Dressing Up\u2019: what to wear, and where \nAmongst the girls in the sample, aged between five and twelve, there is evidence of an \nactive desire for and wearing of a range of clothing styles, shoes and accessories generally \nassociated, at least in Britain, with \u2018emphasised\u2019 adult femininity (Connell 1995). These \nincluded high-heeled shoes and jewelry, and the more contentious items of fashion apparel \nsuch as crop-tops, halter-neck tops, and mini-skirts, central to sexualized presentations of \nadult femininity (Cook and Kaiser 2004). From our discussion with the girls, including \nbased around their project work, there emerged a distinction between \u2018dressing up\u2019 in such \nclothing and accessories as a form of role play or rehearsal of adult femininity that was \nenacted inside the house, and \u2018dressing up\u2019 for \u2018going out\u2019.  \n \nTo introduce this theme in the data, I begin with the example of shoes with \u2018high heels\u2019. \nThese are recognizably long-established items of girls' \u2018dressing up\u2019 paraphernalia, \nborrowed from their mothers\u2019 wardrobe, and through the boost in height they give the \nwearer, represent a practical (if temporary) means of \u2018growing up\u2019. In our sample, the desire \nfor high heels was evident even amongst the youngest girls. For example, Emma (aged five) \ndrew pictures of herself wearing high heels; she said \u2018I'd like high ones [shoes] not low \nones\u2019. Katy (aged seven) both drew and cut-out pictures (from shopping catalogues) of high \nheels as items she would like to have: \u2018I quite like them and everyone at school has them\u2019. \nTwo slightly older girls, Megan and Hayley (both aged eight) each reported that they \n 5 \nactually had their own high-heeled foot wear, and indeed showed them to us during our \nfieldwork visits. However, their consumption experiences were quite different in several \nrespects. In Megan\u2019s case, several items of high heeled footwear were purchased for her by \nher mother, and were subsequently worn for a variety of \u2018going out\u2019 occasions with the full \nand active encouragement of her mother. Megan had a pair of high heeled boots with flower \nmotif and beads. These, worn out to a special family occasion, were a favourite: \u2018I like high \nheels and I like the zip and I like the flower on it\u2019. The boots were purchased by Megan\u2019s \nmother, after several attempts in different shops because of the difficulty in getting the right \nsize. During a fieldwork visit, Megan presented a pair of sandals, styled with straps and with \na one-and-a-half inch heel, and decorated with purple sequins, as another favourite pair of \nshoes. Megan said she wore these \u2018for all sorts\u2019 but especially for going out to \u2018discos and \nparties\u2019. Her mother explained that after wearing these sandals, Megan often came home \nwith sore feet; so much so that she could not wear them again for a few weeks. Megan was \nproud of her ability to walk in high shoes, and of her perseverance in doing so despite the \ndiscomfort they caused her, saying that her mother had said that she herself could not walk \nin them that high. This suggests that Megan gained a sense of \u2018ageing up\u2019 (Hockey and \nJames 1993) through wearing the sandals: she displayed competency in wearing shoes that \nher own mother said she would have difficulty walking in. Moreover, Megan\u2019s consumption \nof high heeled footwear was important to her, not as a child\u2019s game of playing inside the \nhouse at dressing up, but instead in a more adult-like way, of dressing up to go out to events \nand occasions. Similarly, in her photo project, Megan had a photo taken of herself wearing \ncamouflage-style trousers and a cropped, gypsy-style top\n3\n which displayed her belly. She \ndescribed them as her \u2018dressing-up clothes, my night out, going out night clothes, very, very \ntrendy\u2019. Clearly, for Megan, the fashionable \u2018trendiness\u2019 of the clothes was  important, in \nkeeping with a \u2018tweenager\u2019 style valuing of fashion amongst girls under twelve years old \n(Cook and Kaiser 2004; Mintel 2003). \n 6 \n \nThe case of Hayley and her high-heeled footwear further suggests the ways in which the \nmeanings the girls gave to their clothing and footwear was mediated by interactions and \nnegotiations with their parents, and especially their mothers. Hayley\u2019s favourite shoes were \nwhite platform-heel boots (of 1970s-style) and another high-heeled pair (measuring some \nfive-and-a-half inches according to Hayley), both of which Hayley herself had purchased \nfrom a second-hand shop. As with Megan, competency in being able to walk in them, \ndespite their height, was important; indeed the reason why they were in the second- hand \nshop was, according to Hayley, that the original owner(s) \u2018thought they were too high\u2019. For \nHayley, these shoes were \u2018cool\u2019 and also made her distinctive from her friends who did not \nhave similar shoes: \u2018I'm one of the kind\u2019. Despite Hayley\u2019s liking of such shoes, the \u2018ageing \nup\u2019 she gained from her skill in wearing them and the way they marked her unique style, she \nnonetheless regarded them as items for \u2018dressing up\u2019, inside the house. In her project work, \nHayley chose a picture of shoes which she liked because they were \u2018quite high\u2019, but made it \nclear that she would not wear such shoes for going out, only for \u2018dressing up\u2019 inside the \nhouse. This use of high-heeled footwear in an inside-the-house rehearsal of adult femininity \nwas very clearly an outcome of negotiations between Hayley and her mother, whose \nposition on the wearing of high heels contrasted markedly with that of Megan\u2019s mother. In \nparticular, Hayley was not allowed to wear her high-heeled shoes outside the house because \n\u2018they are too high and I think she might fall over\u2019 (Janet, Hayley\u2019s mother). Hayley was \nallowed to wear a favourite pair of high-heeled shoes to a special occasion of a birthday \nparty, but notably, this was inside someone else's house.  \n \nParental strategies that enabled or constrained the girls\u2019 desires for and consumption of \nadult-style attire were also evident in the case of clothing fashions that were contested, not \nbecause of the physical danger of falling over (as with the shoes), but because of moral \n 7 \ndanger arising from the ways in which they revealed the bare skin of the girls\u2019 bodies. Katy \n(aged seven) said that her mother did not really like her to have clothes with glitter or \nsparkle on them and that they often argued about the purchase and wearing of tops without \nany sleeves. As the following data extract makes clear, whilst for Katy, her mother \nespecially disliked the embellishments (the glitter and sparkle) of the contested tops, Katy\u2019s \nmother herself pointed to the \u2018tarty\u2019 and \u2018revealing\u2019 styling of the clothing: : \u2018The only time \nI give in a little bit is the school disco\u2019. \n \nSimilarly, in the following data extract, Hayley and her mother Janet are discussing a \nparticular top which had caused a disagreement between them because it was too \n\u2018revealing\u2019: \nHayley:  I don't even wear it. \nJanet:  No, well that was \u2018cos I didn't really agree with that one. \n \nHayley went on to explain that she wore the top for \u2018dressing up\u2026just at home\u2019 because due \nto her mother's disapproval \u2018I'm not allowed to go out, am I?\u2019.  For both Hayley and Katy, \ntheir consumption of \u2018revealing\u2019 clothing was constrained by their mothers\u2019 ideas of what \nwas acceptable for them to wear, and where. This provides a clear example of the kinds of \npower adults have over what children wear on their bodies, when and where, identified by \nHood-Williams (1990), but also of the kinds of intergenerational negotiations that take place \nbetween parents and children (James, Jenks and Prout 1998; Prout 2000). The revealing tops \nat issue were purchased and worn, even though they were coded by the mothers as \n\u2018restricted\u2019, to be worn only in certain contexts. In Hayley\u2019s case, this meant only for \n\u2018dressing up\u2019 inside the house. For Katy\u2019s mother, Amanda, the school was an acceptable \nand known (safe) interior space\/place and the disco an acceptable occasion for such \nrestricted clothing to be worn, not least because \u2018other girls\u2019 there would also be wearing \n 8 \nthem. In alluding to the 'other girls', Amanda was also conceding the significance of peer \nrelations for her daughter, of securing acceptance and a sense of belonging from wearing the \n\u2018right\u2019 clothes, that was also referred to by Katy in relation to her desire for high-heeled \nshoes. For Hayley, too, fitting in with peers was important in her liking for a crop top: \u2018I just \nkind of like it because everyone else has got one, so I kind of get one to fit in\u2019. \n \nWe get a sense from Katy\u2019s discussion (above) that she likes tops which are not \u2018plain\u2019 and \nnot \u2018normal\u2019. Katy herself does not give the \u2018revealing\u2019 effect of their styling as her reason \nfor liking to wear them. In her project work, Katy chose a picture of a \u2018one-shoulder\u2019 top4 as \nan item of clothes she would like because \u2018I like the style and I like the pattern\u2019. In fact, \nnone of the girls in our study spoke about the effect of revealing skin as an explicit reason \nfor their liking, wanting or wearing such items of clothing. Emma (aged five) said she had \nan off-the-shoulder dress in pink, \u2018sort of see-through\u2019 material with \u2018a lot of sparkle\u2019. For \nEmma, the attraction of the dress was more to do with the fabric and the embellishments \nthan the bare skin the styling of the dress revealed.  Susie (aged 10, and Katy\u2019s older sister) \ndiscussed her liking of halter-neck\n5\n tops which she had \u2018a lot of\u2019 and also a mini-skirt, liked \nbecause of its elastic waist feature. Again, the bearing of skin through these favoured styles \nwas not the issue but rather the hyper-feminine styling of the item in and of itself (see also \nRussell and Tyler 2002).  \n \nHayley also had a gypsy-style top which she explained was \u2018like elasticated and you can \npull it over [off] your shoulder\u2019. For Hayley, though, this style of clothing was not suitable \nfor wearing out to her church: the implication here is that this is because of the \u2018bare \nshoulder\u2019 effect of the top. Amongst the girls in our study, then, there is evidence of a desire \nfor and active wearing of clothes that reveal skin. This effect was not, however, given as a \nreason for liking this clothing style, suggesting that such desires were \u2018innocent\u2019 of the \n 9 \nsymbolically sexual meanings of revealed feminine skin (Cook and Kaiser 2004; Kaiser \n2001). Relatedly, in the girls\u2019 accounts of their preferences, neither was it suggested that the \ndeliberate 'smallness' of the clothing style was used in order to 'age up' their bodies (Hockey \nand James 1993; Wright 1993). \n \nWhat not to wear: \u2018showing\u2019 your body  \nEvidence presented so far shows, amongst the girls in our study, both a desire for and actual \nwearing of clothing styles that revealed bare flesh, including shoulders and upper chest \nareas, midriffs or bellies and the leg above the knee. Yet it is the styling of the clothes that \nwas emphasized by the girls, not the revealing of the body they enabled. In contrast, when \nthe girls spoke about their clothing dislikes, it was this very effect that they mostly objected \nto. In keeping with their earlier noted preferences, neither Katy (aged seven) or Megan (aged \neight) expressed disapproval or rejection of revealing clothing styles. The other girls in our \nstudy reported their dislike and in some cases strong disapproval of \u2018showing\u2019 one's body \nvia clothing.  \n \nFor Emma (aged five) her dislike of tops with thin shoulder straps or those with off-the-\nshoulder styling seemed more to do with the impracticality of the fit to her body. In her \nproject, it was written that she disliked \u2018very thin straps on the shoulders which keep falling \noff her shoulders and down her arms\u2019. For Hattie (aged 12, cousin to Emma and Jennifer), \nissues of impracticality combined with that of unwanted exposure of the skin in her account \nof \u2018revealing\u2019 clothing. Being a wheelchair user, and thus positioned lower down, gave \nHattie and her mother special reason for caution in clothing styling in relation to exposure of \nthe body. In her project, Hattie wrote \u2018I would also love to wear mini-skirts but as I am in a \npower chair all day these are not very practical as my legs would get very cold plus they are \ntoo short when sitting down\u2019. As Hattie\u2019s mother explained, \u2018we have to be careful with the \n 10 \nlength of her skirts\u2026 we have to make sure it covers\u2019. Hattie herself several times \nmentioned tops and a concern that her low sitting position made it easier for people (not \nspecifically boys or men) to \u2018look down\u2019 at her chest. Baggy tops, for example, were said by \nHattie to \u2018show too much cleavage\u2019 and made her worry that \u2018they are looking down my \ntop\u2019, whilst \u2018revealing dresses\u2019 were disliked because they \u2018look too old on me and not very \nnice\u2019. It is apparent here that Hattie is aware of the ways in which clothing can have the \neffect of \u2018ageing-up\u2019 the body to look older, an effect that she wants to avoid for herself. A \nmix of impracticality and the unwanted effect of the display of skin were also given by \nJennifer (aged 9) in her account of styles she disliked. Jennifer disliked \u2018high heels\u2019 because \nthey are \u2018too high up\u2026I wouldn't walk very well in them. I'd fall over me\u2019. Crop-tops were \nalso included in her project as a disliked item of clothing because of the way they exposed \nskin: they \u2018show belly too much [sic]\u2019. As in the case of Hattie, the identity of those to \nwhom one's body is being 'shown' was not clear in the girls' accounts. There was an \nawareness that 'revealing' clothing makes the body and bare skin exposed to \u2018the gaze\u2019 - but \nit is the ungendered gaze of people in general, rather than particularly, say, boys or men.  \n \nFor Hayley, it was not just the exposure of skin that was an unwanted effect of wearing \n\u2018revealing\u2019 clothing but also the risk of exposure of underwear. Hayley told us that \u2018I don't \noften wear my short red kilt because when I sit down it shows my knickers\u2019. This particular \ngirl also spoke about how her school uniform sometimes revealed her body in ways that she \ndid not like: \u2018it gets a bit annoying sometimes because...if I wear a skirt and I choose to do \ncartwheels all day and that kind of gets a bit annoying because my skirt comes up\u2019. \n \nHayley\u2019s comments here point to the way the more \u2018traditional\u2019 clothes girls are expected to \nwear (skirts and dresses) can act to inhibit girls in their physical performance of childhood, \nas discussed by Cahill (1989: 291). As for the other girls, though, for Hayley, it was \n 11 \nrevealing clothes (such as crop-tops) that \u2018show too much bare skin\u2019 that were especially \nproblematical; her preference was for styles that she described as 'more covered\u2019. In \nresponse to suggestions from the interviewer, Hayley said she would consider wearing a \ncrop-top in contexts like on a beach or on holiday in a hot country. However, she would not \nwalk through the High Street of her local town wearing it: \u2018God, no\u2019. This example, along \nwith the earlier described example of what not to wear to church, shows the understanding \nHayley had of the symbolic value of clothing and its importance in the contextual \npresentation of self (Goffman 1969). This is an understanding also demonstrated by other \ngirls in the study, including Megan and her 'going out night' clothes (see also below).  \n \nIt is clear from the project work and interview data presented here that the girls\u2019 reasons for \ndisliking \u2018revealing\u2019 clothing in relation to their own bodies centered on the unwanted effect \nof showing their skin or underwear. Although not clearly articulated by the girls, with the \npossible exception of Hayley, I suggest that their objections stemmed from a concern with \nmodesty. In the girls\u2019 discussions of controversial clothing fashions worn by others, \nespecially well-known celebrities including pop stars they had encountered through \nmagazines or television, issues of modesty were addressed more clearly. Once again, the \npreviously noted distinction drawn between \u2018dressing up\u2019 inside the house and \u2018dressing up\u2019 \noutside emerged in the girls' accounts. \n \nSusie (aged 10) drew a picture of the singer Beyonce wearing high heels, short skirt and a \nstring or halter-neck top. For Susie, like those in the pop group Liberty X, Beyonce is \nsomeone who \u2018sometimes the things she wears are a bit too skimpy\u2026\/\/. Short and a bit \ntoo\u2026erm\u2026.(S. B.: You wouldn't go out in it?). Yeah (laughs)\u2019. Elsewhere in her project, \nSusie included a picture of an off-the-shoulder crop top as an item she disliked because \u2018I \ncan't really wear it out anywhere because it's a bit\u2026.(S.B.: Like something Beyonce would \n 12 \nwear? ). Yes'. Like Beyonce, singer Kylie Minogue was another celebrity anti-role model \nfor the girls in our study due to the styling of her clothing and the immodest bodily display it \nentailed. For Hattie (aged 12), Kylie Minogue \u2018wears too many short dresses and shows off \ntoo much of her legs\u2019. The brevity or smallness of clothing was also a continuing theme in \nthe project work completed by Hayley (aged 8). In a discussion of a crop-top style T-shirt, \nshe came the nearest of all the girls to identifying the sexual meanings of such clothing \nstyles. For Hayley, the T-shirt in question was \u2018Yuk\u2026awful\u2019, due to a combination of its \nbright colour and it being \u2018too short\u2019: \u2018It's just a bit tarty and a bit showy\u2019.   \n \nOur data suggest that the meanings the girls in the study gave to 'revealing' clothing were \nmarked by some ambivalence. In relation to their own bodies, the girls stressed the styling \nand embellishments, the trendiness and fashion of clothing, over and above the effect of \nrevealing their skin. When this effect was discussed, it was in most cases, unwanted and the \ncause of anxiety about being subjected to the gaze of unspecified others and in violation of a \ngirl's sense of modesty in relation to her own body. In relation to the bodies of celebrity \nothers encountered through popular media culture, an understanding of the symbolic value \nof clothing in terms of modesty and morality emerged strongly, over and above the styling, \nembellishment, \u2018trendiness\u2019 and fashion of the clothing itself. The small, short clothes \n(Wright 1993) may have been functional in that they were sufficient to actually cover the \ncrucial areas of the women's bodies and prevent nakedness.  Nonetheless, such clothes were \ncoded by the girls as symbolically immodest, as \u2018not nice\u2019.  This points to the girls' \nknowledge and understanding of the symbolic value of clothing in relation to femininity, \neven if they did not fully articulate its gendered or sexualised component (see also Cook and \nKaiser 2004; Russell and Tyler 2002). \n \nConclusions \n 13 \nThe findings from our study point to the importance of not \u2018reading off\u2019 the meanings of \ngirls\u2019 consumption of fashion styles from market trends, media debates, or the concerns of \nparents. For the girls in our study at least, controversial clothing held a range of contingent \nand often contradictory meanings. Some girls, like Hayley, wore contested items of \nfootwear and clothing especially for playing 'dressing up' inside the house, in an articulation \nof children's distinctive 'tribal' culture (James, Jenks and Prout 1998). Others like Megan, \nwore them, as she put it, as 'going out night clothes' in a reflexive, knowing engagement \nwith fashion trends. Such differences in the meanings girls' gave to their consumption of \ncontested clothing, I argue, was at least partly contingent upon parental (especially mothers) \nviews as to what their daughters were allowed to wear, and where, and to the subsequent \nnegotiations between mothers and daughters. Importantly, though, the girls in our study also \narticulated their own reflexive and skilful understandings of how 'what to wear and where' is \ncontingent upon contexts, both in relation to their own presentation of their embodied selves \nand when discussing the revealing clothing styles of women celebrities like Beyonce and \nKylie Minogue. Although primarily suggestive, these aspects of our findings lend support to \nthose authors like Sweetman (2001) who, in criticism of some postmodern consumption \nperspectives, insist that 'what to wear' (where and when) remains structured, at least in part, \nby statuses such as stage in life course and gender. \n \nControversial clothing was meaningful for girls in relation to their own desires to be \n'fashionable', to dress their bodies in the ways that their peers (apparently) did. Here, \nemphasis was placed primarily upon the styling and embellishments of garments; in other \nwords, it was the ways in which the garment was 'trendy' in and of itself. Arguably, then, \nthose girls who desired and wore revealing clothing had been 'seduced' by the styling and \nembellishments of the garments over and above the accompanying and largely unwanted \neffect of revealing skin. One implication of this finding is that, to avoid the wrath of public \n 14 \ndebate and the antipathies of parents, clothing retailers should carefully attend to the use of \nthe 'aesthetics of femininity' (Russell and Tyler 2002)  in garments. These features make \nwhat might also be 'revealing' clothing items of desire for girls. Indeed, there is some \nevidence of sensitivity to this issue amongst major retailers in girls\u2019 wear. For example, \nSwedish-based H&M have policy statements on children's clothing and publicly proclaim \nthat 'we do not make clothes that may be perceived as provocative on small children' (H&M \n2002). Moreover, in our interviews with children's wear industry executives in England, \nseveral claimed to operate a policy of caution, albeit an unofficial one. As one executive for \na major British retailer said, '[Our company] has a conscience...we won't do things that are \ntoo short', nor 'in a sexual way, because that\u2019s not what we are trying to convey'. \n \nAs I noted earlier, the effect of baring one's skin through revealing clothing was not \nexplicitly valued by any of the girls. When discussing their feelings about wearing such \nclothes on their own bodies, and in discussion of the clothing styles of women celebrities, \nthe girls expressed views to the effect that such clothing was immodest. 'Showing your \nbody', for the girls in our study, was not a nice thing to do, whether it was Hayley playing \nhandstands, Hattie in her wheelchair or Kylie Minogue on television. In this respect, then, \nconcerns over damage to children's 'innocent' sense of morality through the sexualisation of \ngirls' clothing, expressed within public debates about the erosion of childhood, are \nunfounded. Amongst the girls in our study at least, there was a strong sense of the morally \nsymbolic meanings of clothing with respect to not showing the body. It is less clear, though, \nthat the girls recognised the specifically sexual character of revealing clothing, or indeed had \na firm sense of to whom the showing of the body was directed. The girls' consumption of \nrevealing clothing, both in relation to their own bodies and in appraisal of celebrity others, \ncan not be argued to be 'unknowingly innocent': they evaluated the clothing at issue in moral \nterms. Yet, neither were the sexual values of the clothing fully articulated by the girls. With \n 15 \nthis caveat about sexuality in mind, amongst the girls in our study, the evidence is rather \nmixed as to the extent to which there was a 'knowing' engagement with clothing fashions as \nthe 'trappings' of femininity and of empowerment gained through such engagement \n(McRobbie and Nava 1984; McRobbie 1996; Russell and Tyler 2002). For girls in our \nstudy, like Hayley and Megan, it is evident that pleasure was gained through 'ageing up' \n(Hockey and James 1993), for example, through wearing high heels or dressing up in \n'trendy' clothes, either as a form of play inside the house or for \u2018going out\u2019. Moreover, both \nMegan and Hayley experienced a sense of empowerment through their precocious skill in \nbeing able to walk in high-heeled shoes. Yet, the wearing of such attire also acted to \ndisempower the girls. Examples here include Hattie worrying about people looking up her \nskirt or down her top, and Hayley being concerned about showing her knickers when \nwearing short skirts or doing handstands. Through their appraisals of revealing clothing in \nterms of modesty, the girls in our study do demonstrate an ability to reflect critically on \ndominant images of the bodily styles of adult femininity. Yet, through their own practices of \nclothing consumption, it is clear that the girls also continued to include such styles of \nfemininity in the selections they made from the range of clothing available to them, and in \ntheir constrained, but nonetheless, active and creative articulation of their own feminine \nchildhoods. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1\n The wider sample of the study included two girls (sisters) of Pakistani heritage and whose religious affiliation was \nMuslim. In accordance with Muslim culture, Saima and Yasmeen expressed strongly disapproving views on \u2018revealing \nclothing\u2019 and material from their interviews and project work are not included in this paper. \n 16 \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n2\n All names used in the paper are pseudonyms.  \n3\n \u2018Gypsy\u2019 style tops are styled with heavily elasticated fabric across the chest, a feature that enables the wearer to pull \nthe garment down off the shoulder to the upper arms, thereby fully exposing both shoulders, and the upper chest and \nupper back areas of the body. \n4\n A top styled with only one shoulder covered with fabric or with a strap, leaving the other shoulder completely \nexposed. \n5\n A top styled to fit the body via a neck fastening, and which exposes the shoulders, and upper back. \n 27 \nBibliography \n \nAldridge, A.
