This paper connects emerging research on the use of design patterns and pattern languages\nwith a conception of educational design as a conversation between theory and praxis. We illustrate\nthe argument by drawing on recent empirical research and literature reviews from the field of\nnetworked learning.\nIntroduction\nA starting point for the argument presented in this article is that educational design\nis becoming a more complex and a more inclusive area of activity, where once it\nwould have be characterised as a specialist occupation involving some tried and tested\nprocedures (Wilson, 1997; Reiser, 2002). As conceptions of learning become more\nsophisticated and diverse, and as learners and teachers become more proactive in\nshaping the learning environment, so educational design becomes a more distributed\nactivity\u2014one that involves the generation of new roles, concepts, tools and methods\n(Spector & Anderson, 2000). We argue that the increasing complexity of learning\nsituations will require and help people to become more design-savvy. Sometimes this\nwill mean participating in design. At other times it will mean recognising good design\nand making good choices.\nSome of the sources of increased complexity are visible now. We are asking learners\nto become more autonomous and to exercise choice over the broad shape and fine\ndetails of what, why, how, where and when they learn (Simons et al., 2000). This\nincludes choice about whether they learn with others. In some areas of formal\n*Corresponding author. Faculty of Education and Social Work (A35), University of Sydney, NSW\n2006, Australia.

In other\nlearning situations, learners insist upon greater control. Whether for sound\npedagogical reasons or in response to consumer demand, shifts to greater learner\ncontrol add complexity to educational design. Couple this with accelerating\ntechnological change, especially the growth of smarter and more ubiquitous personal,\nmobile and social technologies, and educational design looks even more complex. It\nhas to be a distributed problem: not one amenable to top-down solution.\nCarl Bereiter (2002) has argued that education is beginning to shift from folk\nconceptions to more scientific conceptions of mind, knowledge and coming to know.\nConversations about learning, teaching and educational design\u2014involving learners,\nteachers, designers and researchers\u2014are necessary to, and necessitated by, this shift.\nThe main purpose of this article is to show how such conversations can be\nsupported by an educational design paradigm based on the use of design patterns and\npattern languages. This design paradigm is unashamedly democratic\u2014its purpose is\nto help people understand and take more control in educational design. The structure\nof the article is as follows. First, we explain what we mean by theory\u2013praxis conver-\nsations, and why we think these are important. Second, we introduce the idea of\ndesign patterns and pattern languages. (Our debts are to Lawrence Stenhouse and\nChristopher Alexander, respectively.) Third, we give a worked example of how\nempirical research on networked learning connects with the development of a pattern\nlanguage for networked learning. Fourth, we show how such a pattern language can\nbe a resource for, and enhanced by, theory\u2013praxis conversations. We conclude with\nsome observations about promising lines for further research and development work.\nMost of our work on this theme has been in the domain of networked learning\u2014\nalthough the implications of our argument probably run more widely than this. By\nnetworked learning we mean an educational context in which information and\ncommunication technologies are used to promote collaborative and cooperative\nconnections\u2014between one learner and other learners; between learners and teachers;\nbetween a learning community and its learning resources\u2014so that participants can\nextend and develop their understanding and capabilities in ways that are important\nto them, and over which they have significant control (Banks et al., 2003, p. 1).\nDesign for networked learning involves a number of challenges to create and\nsupport powerful learning contexts in which teachers and learners can interact\nconstructively. In part, we think these challenges can be addressed through theory\u2013\npraxis conversations. In such \u2018conversations\u2019, pedagogical and learning theories inter-\nact with insights from design praxis leading to the development of richer theory and\nproviding a better basis for designing networked learning.\nTheory\u2013praxis conversations\nWe use the term \u2018praxis\u2019 to mean actions that result from the deliberate application\nof theory or are entailed by a particular theoretical structure (de Laat & Lally, 2003).\nThe idea of a theory\u2013praxis conversation or interaction was developed by Lawrence\nStenhouse (see, for example, Stenhouse, 1983). He argued that the development of\nPattern languages to mediate theory\u2013praxis conversations 213\na theoretical understanding of educational action and doing educational research into\nthe practical problems of education are inseparable. If educational research focuses\non the problems that arise in trying to realise a form of educational praxis, then it will\npose questions both about which actions in the context are constitutive of such praxis\nand about the educational criteria employed in deciding this. To summarise,\neducational research, on Stenhouse\u2019s account, is a process that involves the joint\ndevelopment of educational praxis and theory in interaction\nTo push the conversational metaphor a little further, theory\u2013praxis conversations\nrequire some shared language and common ground\u2014without which it is difficult to\nsee how mutual understanding and influence can be achieved. Such shared language\nand common ground can be hard to find. Practitioner experience gets represented in\n\u2018war stories\u2019, case studies, vignettes or teaching tips\u2014which are not easy to connect\nto theory. Meanwhile research produces evidence and theory that can be hard to\nconnect back to the particular, situated concerns of a practitioner. Matters are even\nworse when we consider learners who have little or no appetite for educational theory.\nWhat we need are ways of bridging between theory and praxis: ways of mediating\nthe conversation. To this end, we introduce the idea of design patterns and pattern\nlanguages (Goodyear et al., 2004; Goodyear, 2005a).\nDesign patterns and pattern languages\nDesign patterns and pattern languages originate in Christopher Alexander\u2019s ideas\nabout architecture (Alexander et al., 1977; Alexander, 1979). Part of Alexander\u2019s\nintention was to democratise architecture by offering a set of conceptual resources\nthat ordinary people could use in (re)shaping their environment. His work provides a\nprincipled, structured but flexible resource for vernacular design. The approach\nresolves a tension between rigour and prescriptiveness\u2014offering useful guidance\nwithout constraining creativity. It helps foreground key design issues that might\notherwise be missed. It redistributes design power from technical specialists to those\nwho inhabit (educational) spaces\u2014in our case, teachers and learners.\nA pattern is a solution to a recurrent problem in a context. In Alexander\u2019s own\nwords, a pattern: \n\u2026 describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this\nsolution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice. (Alexander et al.,\n1977, p. x)\nContext is important in helping constrain and communicate the nature of both\nproblem and solution. Describing the context for the problem and its solution avoids\nover-generalisation. In addition, patterns should also teach. They should be written\nin such a way that they help the reader understand enough about a problem and\nsolution that they can adapt the problem description and solution to meet their own\nneeds. The rationale for the pattern helps with this teaching or explanatory function.\nIdeally, the name of the pattern should crystallise a valued element of design experi-\nence and help relate it to other design elements such that we can create and use a\n214 P. Goodyear et al.\npattern language. The use of patterns, then, can be seen as a way of bridging between\nphilosophy, values, theory, empirical evidence and experience (on the one hand), and\nthe practical problems of design.\nThe textual representations of Alexander\u2019s design patterns have the structure\nshown in Figure 1. An example situated in the area of educational design for\nnetworked learning is given in Figure 2.\nFigure 1. Typical structure of an Alexandrian design pattern (after Alexander et al., 1977, pp. x\u2013xi)2 Des gn pattern for discussion group (Goodye r, 2005a)Some of the meaning of a design pattern comes from its location in a network of\npatterns, otherwise known as a pattern language. For example, it would be possible\nto create a pattern language to capture key elements of educational design for learning\nthrough online discussion. At a high level, this might include patterns for, say,\ndebates, buzz-groups, seminars and tutorials. Lower level patterns capture the key\ntasks implicated in these forms of discussion-based activity, as well as the tools and\nresources needed for their efficient conduct.\nPart of our current work as designer\/teachers in networked learning involves the use\nof software elements that map onto some of these patterns. For instance, Goodyear\nand Reimann\u2019s teaching in the Sydney LearnLab environment provides students with\nthe freedom to set up new discussion fora, wikis and document repositories, and to\nselect other collaboration tools, as and when they decide they need them (Ullman\net al., 2005). This can be done by individuals, or by student project teams, as well as\nby the teacher.

Design pattern for discussion group (Goodyear, 2005a)\n216 P. Goodyear et al.\ntools and organisational forms are useful for which kinds of purposes, and this is\nexactly the kind of problem with which design patterns can help (see, for example,\nGoodyear, 2000).\nOur recent empirical work in this area takes a number of complementary forms,\nincluding: elicitation of pattern-informing evidence and experiential knowledge from\nnetworked learning practitioners, in intensive workshops; similar elicitation processes\nand feedback on prototype design patterns, in semi-structured interviews and focus\ngroups; and \u2018pattern-hatching\u2019 events at conferences and within the meetings of\nproject teams. These are supplemented by analyses of case studies drawn from\nnetworked learning courses as well as syntheses of theory and evidence from the\nresearch literature (Goodyear et al., 2004; Goodyear, 2005a, b).\nIt is on these occasions that pattern languages can mediate theory\u2013praxis conver-\nsations through connecting contextualised but reoccurring problems with validated\nempirical research.\nFrom research to patterns\nIn the previous section a pattern for discussion groups was presented. This pattern\naddressed a known problem in everyday networked learning practice about how to\noffer a good structure for a discussion group. In this section, it is our aim to draw on\na body of empirical research to connect with this pattern and contribute to the conver-\nsation within this pattern language on networked learning environments. The\nproblem about structuring discussion groups as expressed in the design pattern\npresented in Figure 2 is a common issue discussed in many studies on networked\nlearning.\nReviews of the networked learning literature (for example, de Laat, 2006) indicate\nthat students benefit from a proper introduction to, and familiarisation with, this way\nof working and learning together. Taking part in an online discussion, for example,\nrequires particular attitudes and competencies, and it takes time for students to\ndevelop these and\/or bring them to bear on their learning. Paradoxically, students\nusually need to be explicitly informed about, and socialised into, community-based\nconstructivist learning. They have to (re)learn to become active learners, and need\ntime to develop confidence to act as constructive learners, and exercise autonomy. It\nis clear that providing a community forum by itself is not enough. A role for the\nteacher-designer includes creating \u2018ground conditions\u2019 within the course design: to\ncreate the circumstances in which a sense of community can develop, and where\nstudents become aware that there are complex group dynamics involved in learning\ntogether. Students also need to learn to act as a community, where they take on active\nresponsibility for educational processes as well as managing cohesion, well-being,\ntrust, emotion, spirit and motivation in the group.\nDuring earlier research into tutoring and learning processes (de Laat & Lally, 2003,\n2004; de Laat et al., in press) we used a multi-method approach, which provides a\nrich description of the complexity of networked learning settings. This multi-method\napproach was developed to address the multi-faceted complexity of the processes\nPattern languages to mediate theory\u2013praxis conversations 217\ninvolved when tutoring and learning in networked learning communities. In this\napproach, the focus was on triangulating data on social network analysis (who is\ntalking to whom?), content analysis (what are they talking about?) and contextual\nanalysis (why are they talking in such a way?). This method was used repeatedly\nwithin a couple of case studies not only to explore how tutoring and learning\nprocesses take place within networked learning communities, but also how these\nprocesses evolve over time. Through this timeline dimension, certain key factors with\nrespect to the main problem in the previously discussed pattern came to light: \n\u25cf Learning together. Through content and social network analysis we have seen that\nthe students are actively engaged in collaborative learning activities. They debate\nideas and problems among themselves, contribute new information, make\nsummaries, reflect on content, as well as share \u2018social\u2019 experiences that are or are\nnot directly related to the task.\n\u25cf Tutoring together. Group regulation and coordination is something all the participants\nare concerned with. They motivate each other, develop an open learning climate,\nand encourage each other to contribute, think and co-design course activities. Our\nempirical findings show elements of developing a learning agenda together, taking\nactive charge and control over their learning activities and engaging in processes of\nhelping out, supporting and facilitating each other. They develop social relationships\nin order to sustain their work on the learning task.\n\u25cf Personal learning goals. At the same time these collaborative learning activities tend\nto be driven by personal interest and learning agendas. Students try to put forward\ntheir own interests (or stimulate ideas of others who happen to advocate their\ninterests) when the learning task is being conceptualised, and during the project\nthe motivation to regulate and coordinate group processes is often rooted in their\npersonal desire to get the task finished. Comments from fellow students are often\nvalued as a way to achieve one\u2019s personal goals.\n\u25cf Changes over time. In our studies, tutoring and learning activity is highest during\nthe middle phase of activities, where the focus is also drawn towards working on\nthe task and facilitation of group processes. In the beginning phase they show\nelements of working on the task and setting up a group structure to support this\n(facilitated by the teacher). During the closing phase there is a relative increase of\nreflection on the task and a focus on facilitation and instructional design to coordinate\nthe final phase of their collaboration. The teacher is mostly engaged in this as well.\n\u25cf Changing teacher\u2013student relationship. The students do not just rely on guidance\nfrom the teacher, but value and provide support and guidance to each other. The\nteachers, during the courses, try to set the stage in the beginning, and provide\nguidance and reassurance to the group to support the group in developing their\ncollaborative project. But at the same time their position is somewhat \u2018levelled\u2019\nwith that of the students, with a view to creating an open learning environment\nwhere everybody can participate in the development and design of their collabora-\ntive project. The teachers in the case studies act both as learners and tutors,\nalthough their main concern is to guide and facilitate the group\u2019s learning.\n218 P. Goodyear et al.\n\u25cf Group structure. We found that students were developing roles and strategies to\nstructure their collaborative learning. Over time we have seen that these roles are\nnot necessarily occupied by the same people. Each phase has its own configuration\nof people moving into and out of the central positions. Through participation they\nlearn from each other\u2019s strategies and styles, and use this to facilitate their own\nlearning goals as well as the goals of the group.\nThese key factors, when connected to the problem presented in the design pattern,\ncan be used to develop a set of guidelines for a community-centred approach to\nnetworked learning (de Laat, 2006) and can result in the development of a set of\ncommunity-centred design patterns, to help structures emerge and be negotiated, in\nan ongoing process, between the members.\nThere is not room here to give the full text of the design patterns. Instead, we offer\nthe text from the solution part of each pattern (which is the heart of a pattern, see\nFigure 1). The patterns are structured in relation to four key phases of a networked\nlearning programme (start-up, beginning, middle, end) (Table 1). The text in the\nleft-hand column orients the reader to the focal purpose of the pattern. Solution texts\nare given in the middle and right-hand columns. In this table, we have attempted to\ndistinguish between solutions that are oriented primarily to the learner group (middle\ncolumn) and those that are oriented primarily towards the teaching staff (right-hand\ncolumn). In actuality, there can be significant sharing of this work between learner\ngroups and teaching staff.\nPatterns in the theory\u2013praxis conversation\nMoments for reflection and re-design\nAsynchronous networked learning courses offer opportunities (\u2018moments\u2019) for\nevidence-informed decision-making in relation to teaching, learning and design. This\nis much less the case with conventional (synchronous) face-to-face teaching, where\nthe data for analysis is not usually available by default, as it would be in a virtual learn-\ning environment (VLE), and where time is more pressing.\nThese moments for reflection and decision-making occur at a number of scale\nlevels. In addition to the \u2018obvious\u2019 design phase (pre-course), there is also the period\nbetween the end of a course and the next time it is run. It also makes sense to encour-\nage the use of some planned moments for reflection and re-design during the course\n(e.g. at two or three key points in the course; perhaps spending half a day reflecting\non data and experiences from the previous three or four weeks, and planning the next\nthree or four weeks). Also, at the micro-level, it makes sense to encourage taking a\nmore \u2018design-savvy\u2019 approach to online teaching, rather than (say) responding to each\nand every student action.\nWhen applying a community-centred approach to networked learning, as in the\nexample presented in the previous section, where the students have a shared respon-\nsibility and control over the networked learning setting, these moments of reflection\nand re-design do not exclusively belong to the domain of the teacher, but they are in\nPattern languages to mediate theory\u2013praxis conversations 219\nTable 1.

In this approach also\nthe students play an active part in designing networked learning. When building in\nre-occurring moments of reflecting during the course, all the participants are invited\nto think more strategically about their performance and make plans on how to move\nforward.\nWhatever the level of re-design, we advocate an approach in which the work at\nthese moments is informed by a combination of evidence from data analysis (as\noutlined earlier), and theory. The strategies and activities arising from these re-design\nmoments can be embodied in design patterns (and other representations of various\nkinds). This further strengthens an evidence-base for design.\nSharing evidence and design patterns within extensive networked learning communities\nWe think that one of the important features of design patterns is that they represent\nan \u2018actionable locus\u2019: a place where the evidence from data analysis, theorising,\nprevious praxis and practical strategies come together in a form that can be used in\nfurther, real praxis. Such patterns can also be an accessible, readily understandable\nand \u2018standardised\u2019 form in which to share \u2018good\u2019 praxis as it evolves in cycles of\nmomentary refection, theorising and analysis (written in a pattern language). This\nevolution results from the \u2018ongoing conversation\u2019 between theory and praxis.\nCommunities of practice (e.g. networked learning teachers and researchers in higher\neducation) might do well to draw on design patterns as an evolving knowledge-base.\nThis would require some consensus about the format of patterns. Contextual details\nof pattern usage and update would also need to be appended. The knowledge-base\ncould include the actual design pattern as well as the evidence, analysis, theorising\nand experience from praxis upon which it was based, so that community members\ncan both use it and engage with it in a more extended, deeper way. These features\nhelp teachers and others use their own ethical judgement in implementing design\npatterns, and lessen the risk of teachers becoming technicians who simply draw upon\nan expert system, the moral and conceptual basis of which is opaque to them. The\ncommunity location of a design pattern evidence-base becomes a powerful way of\nholding expertise within that community.\nFurther research and concluding comments\nThe most urgent task is to provide high-quality examples of design patterns, together\nwith the analysis, praxis expertise, contextual data and theorising (upon which they\nare based) in an exchangeable format. These need to be embedded in illuminative\ncase studies showing evolution and use in a range of contexts. Beyond that, we need\nto attend to the structures, tools and \u2018economy\u2019 of knowledge exchange among\nnetworked learning practitioners and researchers. These practical tasks raise their\nown research questions about how best to support the collaborative construction of\nknowledge within distributed networked communities and map out an agenda for\nfurther conversations between theory and praxis over the coming years.\n222 P.
