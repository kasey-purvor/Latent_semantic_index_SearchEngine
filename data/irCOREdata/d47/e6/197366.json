It was found that ideals that are important in traditional re-\nlationships, such as trust, honesty, and commitment are just as important in online relation-\nships; however, the cues that signify these ideals vary.\n623\nINTRODUCTION\nRECENT FIGURES ESTIMATE that approxi-mately 262 million people world-wide ac-\ncess the Internet,1 with research showing up to\n60% of newsgroup users having formed per-\nsonal relationships with someone they have\nmet for the first time online.2 Ongoing acade-\nmic discussions have focused on the similari-\nties and differences between \u201conline\u201d and \u201ctra-\nditional\u201d relationships, with opinion divided\nover the importance of available social cues in\nthe creation and maintenance of online rela-\ntionships. For example, Slouka3 has argued that\nonline relationships are shallow and imper-\nsonal. This argument is taken up by several oth-\ners who contend that the relative lack of social\ncues on the Internet renders online relation-\nships more hostile and less fulfilling than tra-\nditional face-to-face relationships.4,5 This argu-\nment is supported by Kraut et al.6 who found\nthat a high level of Internet use is associated\nwith depression and loneliness. In contrast,\nothers argue that Internet relationships are just\nas emotionally fulfilling as face-to-face rela-\ntionships; any lack of social cues can be over-\ncome, and, with time, the reported differences\nbetween online and offline relating dissi-\npates.2,7\u201310 This argument is supported by re-\nsearch indicating that greater Internet use is as-\nsociated with a greater sense of social and\npsychological well-being.11\nParks and Floyd2 argue that these two\nschools of thought represent two versions of In-\nternet relationships: \u201cOne version is of rela-\ntionships lost, while the other is of relationships\nliberated and found\u201d (p. 81). Over the past 10\nyears, however, research has failed unequivo-\n1 School of Applied Social and Human Sciences, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.\n2 Department of Psychology, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.\ncally to support one version or the other. With\nsuch large numbers of people participating in\nthese relationships, we believe it is futile to op-\nerate within this either\/or dichotomy, and in-\nstead, focus on the meaning of online relation-\nships to those who participate in them.\nThe current study focuses predominantly on\nrelationships initiated in chat rooms. These in-\nteractions can be one-on-one or group com-\nmunication, are usually between \u201creal,\u201d iden-\ntified people (although identifies are often\nfabricated or disguised), and occur in real time\n(i.e., are synchronous). In particular, this re-\nsearch aims to explore the ways that available\ncues are taken up and used by chat room par-\nticipants to shape the meanings of their online\nrelationships.\nCMR: Cueless, shallow, and hostile\nRelating over the Internet is usually referred\nto as computer-mediated communication\n(CMC), focussing attention on the linguistic\ncharacteristics of such interactions. Alterna-\ntively the term computer-mediated relating\n(CMR) is used to emphasize a more general\nconcern with \u201c . . . all the varied interpersonal\ndimensions of interactions\u201d12 (p. 8). We will use\nthe terms CMR and online communication to\nrefer to the process of communicating over the\nInternet, and online relationships to refer to the\nfriendships and romantic relationships that are\ninitiated via such communication.\nSome writers emphatically argue that such\nrelationships are shallow and \u201cmeaningless\u201d\ncompared to face-to-face relationships, since\nthey lack the full \u201cbandwidth\u201d provided in\nface-to-face relationships.3 Full bandwidth\nrefers to the full gamut of verbal and nonver-\nbal forms of communication. Theorists such as\nSlouka3 argue that electronic communication\nprovides a sense of intimacy without the emo-\ntional investment that leads to close and en-\nduring relationships.\nThis situation is demonstrated in the \u201cboom\nor bust\u201d phenomenon, in which a rapid pro-\ncess of intimate self-disclosure leads budding\nrelationships to become \u201cquite intense quite\nquickly.\u201d As argued by Cooper and\nSportorali12:\nSuch an accelerated process of relevation may\nincrease the chance that the relationship will\nfeel exhilarating at first, and become quickly\neroticized, but then not be able to be sustained\nbecause the underlying trust and true knowl-\nedge of the other are not there to support it.\n(p. 12)\nFurther, theorists who subscribe to \u201cthe social\npresence theory\u201d and\/or \u201cthe social context\ncues theory\u201d argue that online relationships are\nmore impersonal and less intimate than face-\nto-face relationships. The social presence the-\nory13 contends that \u201csocial presence\u201d is the feel-\ning that one has that other persons are involved\nin a communication exchange. Since CMR in-\nvolves less nonverbal cues (such as facial ex-\npression, posture, dress, and so forth) and au-\nditory cues in comparison to face-to-face\ncommunication, it is said to be extremely low\nin social presence. According to this theory, as\nsocial presence declines communication be-\ncomes more impersonal. Hence, CMR is less\npersonal and intimate. Similarly, the social con-\ntext cues theory14 proposes that online and\nface-to-face communication differ in the\namount of social information available. Social\ncontent cues, such as nonverbal behaviors and\nthe physical environment are not available on-\nline. The absence of social content cues can lead\nto more uninhibited behavior, such as verbal\naggression, blunt disclosure, and nonconform-\ning behavior. This type of behavior, known as\n\u201cflaming,\u201d has been observed across a range of\nonline settings, including business, govern-\nmental, educational, and public networks.2,15\nSuch findings lend further support to the ar-\ngument that online relationships are less inti-\nmate and more aggressive than face-to-face re-\nlationships.\nCMR: Textually rich and emotionally fulfilling\nA strong counter-argument, however, is pro-\nvided by Lea and Spears,7 who point out that\nanxieties about the \u201cmuddying of social dis-\ntance\u201d and concerns about bandwidth have\nbeen with us since the 1890s when the tele-\ngraph and telephones first became a means of\ncommunication. They propose that although\nWHITTY AND GAVIN624\nfirst impressions of individuals who meet over\nthe Internet may be very different from those\nin face-to-face communication (where gender,\nage, and physical attractiveness are immedi-\nately revealed), the lack of face-to-face contact\noffers more radical opportunities in relation-\nship development. The study of online rela-\ntionships requires that we rethink traditional\ntheories of attraction and relationship devel-\nopment and maintenance.\nWhile it is acknowledged that online com-\nmunication lacks many of the physical and\nnonverbal cues made available in face-to-face\ncommunication, many theorists reject the idea\nthat this \u201clack\u201d represents an insurmountable\nobstacle to the development of close personal\nrelationships. Instead, it is argued that text-\nbased cues and the augmentation of CMR with\nother forms of communication render online\nrelationships as intimate and personally fulfill-\ning as any other.2,7\nIndeed, research shows that it is too sim-\nplistic to argue that CMR is altogether devoid\nof social cues. Text-based communication is ca-\npable of providing complex and subtle social\nand cultural information. For example, Lea and\nSpears7 contend that complex gender informa-\ntion can be transmitted via text, with certain\nlinguistic cues distinguishing men\u2019s contribu-\ntions from women\u2019s. That these cues are taken\nup by participants is indicated by their effects\non gender-based behavior. In social online set-\ntings, messages from women receive more at-\ntention from men, while in work-related online\ngroup discussions women\u2019s messages receive\nless attention from both men and women, and\nthreads initiated by women are less likely to re-\nceive a response from the group.\nAlthough this gender-related research points\nto the Web as a site of negative experiences for\nwomen, it is also argued that the Internet can\nprovide a more positive arena for women to ex-\npress themselves, particularly in relation to sex:\nIn the anonymity and safety of Net-space,\nwomen may feel free to be more directly and\nexplicitly sexual, without fear of potential real-\nlife consequences (e.g., pregnancy, forced sex,\nor STD\u2019s [sic]) or the need to deal with men\u2019s\nmore powerful physical presence.\u201d12 (p. 11)\nFurther, others have argued that the view that\nonline relationships are impersonal is flawed\nsince these arguments do not consider that In-\nternet relationships are not necessarily re-\nstricted to CMR. For example, Parks and Floyd2\nreported that their participants extended their\nonline relationships to include the telephone\n(35.3%), snail mail (28.4%), or face-to-face com-\nmunication (33.5%). Moreover, Walther8\u201310 has\nargued that many of the differences between\nonline relationships and face-to-face relation-\nships diminish over time. Although restricted\nbandwidth may limit the rate of information\nexchange, this problem can be alleviated by al-\nlowing longer and\/or more frequent commu-\nnication. Walther argues that although CMR\nmay be more aggressive at first, with time this\ndissipates. In fact, Walther9 has found that\ngroups communicating via computer achieved\nmore positive interpersonal communication on\nseveral levels compared to people communi-\ncating face to face.\nIn conclusion, much of this research does not\nfocus on the intent of Internet users. Instead, it\nis based on the perceived lack of \u201cbandwidth\u201d\nand social cues provided online, and their rel-\native importance in creating and sustaining\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d relationships. Although ethically\nquestionable, Lamb\u2019s16 recent research offers\nan alternative approach to this question. In this\nhighly deceptive study, Lamb studied people\nin chat rooms by participating himself. In this\nway he was able to explore the meanings the\nusers ascribed to their online interactions. He\nadopted several identities, all of which were\nteenage bisexual males. He described himself\nas an honors student, who was athletic, sexu-\nally active, financially comfortable, and curi-\nous. From his experiences he divided the thou-\nsand screen names who contacted him into\nthree broad categories: \u201cThe Browsers,\u201d gen-\nuinely curious people who were exploring the\nmedium and expecting to contact real people;\n\u201cThe Cruisers,\u201d who were seeking instant sex-\nual gratification through fantasized sexual re-\nlations and masturbation; and \u201cThe Pornogra-\nphers,\u201d who wanted to gather and trade\npornography.\nClearly, Lamb\u2019s categories support both\nsides of the current scholarly debate about on-\nSOCIAL CUES IN ONLINE RELATIONSHIPS 625\nline relationships. On the one hand are those\nparticipants for whom the Internet is a poten-\ntial forum for intimate and personal relation-\nships, on the other are those seeking emotion-\nally disconnected and superficially erotic\nencounters. However, for us the important\npoint about this research is that it illustrates\nthat it is not bandwidth that differentiates these\ncategories, but rather the intent of the users\nthemselves.\nThis research\nTo summarize, the Internet is a complex so-\ncial arena that can create and sustain both shal-\nlow, aggressive, and superficially erotic en-\ncounters, as well as more positive, emotionally\nengaged, and committed relationships. The\nquestion that concerns us here, however, is not\nthe types of relationships available online, but\nrather an elucidation of the meanings of online\nrelationships to those who engage in them.\nSimilarly, our concern is not to identify what\ncues are available online, but instead to explore\nthe ways that available cues are taken up and\nused to shape these meanings. To this end, we\nchose to interview people about their online in-\nterpersonal interactions.\nMETHOD\nSixty interviews were carried out as part of\nan undergraduate subject named \u201cRelationship\nStudies,\u201d at the University of Western Sydney\nNepean, located in the outer Western Suburbs\nof Sydney, Australia. Students were trained in\ninterviewing techniques, and then given an\nopen-ended, semistructured interview sched-\nule. They were each instructed to interview one\nfriend over the age of 17, who regularly uses\nthe Internet. The students were then required\nto transcribe the tape-recorded interviews ver-\nbatim. These transcripts, together with signed\nconsent forms, were then submitted to Monica\nWhitty (the subject coordinator) for analysis by\nboth authors.\nParticipants were asked questions concern-\ning which modes of communication they use\non the Internet, including newsgroups, E-mail,\nand chat rooms. They were further questioned\nabout the types of relationships formed, the\nconversations they engage in, how honest they\nare, and how these relationships relate to off\nline relationships. This paper focuses on the\ndata generated from discussions relating to\nchat rooms.\nParticipants\nOf the 60 transcripts submitted and ana-\nlyzed, 28 interviews were conducted with men\nand 32 with women. The participant\u2019s ages\nranged from 17 to 51 years old, with a mean\nage of 23.\nFINDINGS\nFrom online chat to offline talk: The development of\ntrust in internet relationships\nOur research supports previous findings that\nrelationships beginning on the Internet often\nextend beyond the Net.2,17 Indeed, some of our\nparticipants reported face-to-face (FTF) com-\nmunication with people they met online. Many\nof these reported encounters involved one or\nboth partners physically travelling great dis-\ntances for these meetings\u2014a testament to the\nstrength of the online ties that have been cre-\nated.\nWe were chatting for probably on and off for 3\u20134\nmonths. We decided it was time to meet and every-\nthing fell in. She was coming up to Sydney [from\nMelbourne]. She was staying with friends, but she\nstayed here . . . We got on like a house on fire. It\nwas a semicomfortable situation. It was a wonder-\nful time, but she wanted to be in a relationship . . .\nYou can\u2019t have a relationship on the Internet. A\nclose friendship was on the Internet, but not ro-\nmantically. (21-year-old male)\nFurther, there was a striking similarity in the\nstages of progression from online to offline\ncommunication for our participants. The fol-\nlowing quotation illustrates the typical se-\nquence of communicative channels followed in\nthese developing relationships.\nI\u2019ve just always wanted to [meet him] since we\nfirst started talking to each other, on like the first\ntime I met him we were just talking for hours and\nWHITTY AND GAVIN626\nhours, and we were like \u201cI\u2019ve got to meet you to-\nmorrow.\u201d We started meeting each other all the\ntime in chat rooms, E-mailing each other all the\ntime, and then started calling. We were like \u201cDo\nyou want my phone number?,\u201d \u201cI want to meet\nyou.\u201d I was like coming to America next year, \u201cDo\nyou want me to meet you?\u201d He said, like \u201cYeah.\u201d\n[She did go to America and they met.] (21-\nyear-old female)\nHaving progressed through these stages,\nseveral of our participants believed that the In-\nternet eventually becomes obsolete to these re-\nlationships.\nYes, I met someone on the Net . . . It wasn\u2019t like I\nsat down at my computer and told myself I was go-\ning to look for a relationship . . . we were in [In-\nternet] contact for a while, spoke to each other for\na while, then decided to meet one day. We were\nfriends for a while and eventually it led to a rela-\ntionship. It went . . . we were together for about\ntwo months. I think once you meet then it goes be-\nyond the Internet, so it becomes just like any other\nrelationship . . . you get to the point where the In-\nternet becomes obsolete. (23-year-old male)\nSuch comments appear to lend credence to\nthe argument that this broadening of commu-\nnication points to a blurring of the distinction\nbetween on and offline activities for many\nyoung people. As Parks and Floyd state2:\n. . . cyberspace is simply another place to meet.\nJust like people who meet in other locales,\nthose who meet in cyberspace frequently\nmove their relationships into settings beyond\nthe one in which they met originally. They do\nnot appear to draw a sharp boundary between\nrelationships in cyberspace and those in real\nlife.2 (p. 94)\nHowever, our research indicates that some of\nthose involved in Internet relationships do in-\ndeed make a clear distinction between com-\nmunication channels, and that the meaning of\nthese distinct channels carries important sym-\nbolic significance in relation to the develop-\nment of the relationship. It appears that allow-\ning someone to know your E-mail, then your\nphone number, and finally your address, rep-\nresents increasing levels of trust in the rela-\ntionship and in one\u2019s online partner.\nNormally if I have someone\u2019s email address it\nmeans that I know them a little better, so I might\ntrust them a little more. (19-year-old male)\nIt [progressing from E-mail to phone] actually\nmade it closer. Because off the Net . . . , like you\ntalk to people through the Net or through the \nE-mail and then you exchange [phone] numbers,\nthen it\u2019s like a big thing, and yeah you have to be\ngame enough and you should be a bit scared. (20-\nyear-old female)\nNot only does this progressive sequence from\nchat, to E-mail, to phone, to face to face repre-\nsent different levels of trust, but the hope that\nthis sequence of events will be followed repre-\nsents a strong commitment to these online re-\nlationships.\nOnline commitment: More than just a meeting of\nminds\nParks and Floyd2 define commitment as the\nexpectation that the relationship will continue\ninto the future; it involves \u201ca desire to continue\nthe relationship and the belief that it should and\nmust continue\u201d (p. 88). For our participants,\ncommitment to a relationship means not only\nthat it should and must continue, but that this\ncontinuation should take increasingly intimate\nform, with the ultimate aim of FTF encounters.\nIn fact, we found that the expectation that there\nwill at some point be FTF communication forms\na part of the conversational background to many\nof the online relationships formed by both the\nmen and the women in this study.\n. . . I have met heaps of people from the Internet,\nbut I speak to them for a while [on the Net], then\nspeak to them on the phone, and eventually talk to\nthem in person. You have to meet, it doesn\u2019t work\nif you only speak on the Internet, you end up los-\ning interest after awhile. (19-year-old male)\nFurthermore, for some of the participants,\nthe realization that a face-to-face meeting was\nnot likely to emerge out of a close and ongoing\nInternet relationship was a source of disap-\npointment.\nYes, it\u2019s heartbreaking to know that someone is so\nsuited to you yet so far away. (19-year-old fe-\nmale)\nSOCIAL CUES IN ONLINE RELATIONSHIPS 627\nI mean, over the Net, when you go on, there\u2019s peo-\nple from other states so you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re\ntalking to until you get to know them and hook up\nwith them and start liking them, and realize \u201cOK,\nthey\u2019re from another state,\u201d and that\u2019s where the\nproblem comes because one\u2019s here and one\u2019s there,\nand long-distance relationships [over the Internet\nonly] tend to work for a little while but not for too\nlong. (20-year-old male)\nHowever, interestingly, on several occasions\nthese greatly anticipated face-to-face encoun-\nters did not live up to expectations. Some rela-\ntionships seem to work better solely on the In-\nternet. Indeed many of the women who had\nrelationships maintained them purely as online\nrelationships, with some relationships contin-\nuing as close online relationships even after less\nthan comfortable face-to-face encounters.\nIt developed through an interesting chat on IRC and\na series of about 500 E-mails. The attraction was\nmerely someone who cared and listened. He was very\nsensitive and caring, and his picture was hot!\n{laughs} . . . we exchanged addresses and he sent me\npresents on Valentines Day and Easter. We would\nwrite a two-page E-mail every day, send sounds to\neach other, and eventually after six months we talked\non the phone. Our phone conversation was very weak\nso we decided to stick to E-mail . . . We met after\neight months of exchanging E-mails. He was a great\nguy, and it would have worked but he lived in E-\nmail. It was a good experience though and he was ex-\nactly like his photo. {18-year-old female}\nThe final comments of this young woman of-\nfer great insight into the experience of online\nrelating for many of the young men in our\nstudy. These men do indeed \u201clive\u201d in E-mail;\nthat is, they seem to \u201ccome alive\u201d in their on-\nline communications. Many of the men in our\nstudy experience the Internet as a liberating\nmedium; it allows them the freedom to be\nthemselves. Further, this sense of freedom\nstems in part from the types of social cues and\ninformation often considered to be \u201clacking\u201d in\nInternet communication.\nTruth, lies and anonymity: Revealing the \u201ctrue\u201d\nself through white lies\nIt is often assumed that online communica-\ntions lack many of the factors emphasized in\ntraditional accounts of relationship develop-\nment.7 These include, among other things,\nphysical proximity, information about physical\nappearance, cues about group membership,\nand information about broader social member-\nship. As Parks and Floyd2 ask, are these con-\nditions really necessary for the development of\nrelationships? Our data indicate that, not only\nare they not necessary, their absence actually\nencourages and enhances online relations, es-\npecially for young men. In fact, our findings\nsupport the claim that \u201cless can mean more . . .\nit is precisely the gaps in information as much\nas the information itself that give mediated sex\nits allure\u201d7 (p. 218).\nNot surprisingly, many of our participants\ncommented on an absence of nonverbal cues in\ntheir online communications. What was im-\nportant about this absence, however, was that\nit impeded their judgement about the honesty\nof their online partners.\nYou lose a certain amount of ability to be able to\ncommunicate, umm, in terms of nonverbal com-\nmunication, body language, stuff like that. Tone of\nvoice is also . . . absent from it. You also lose the\nability to be able to judge people\u2019s honesty effec-\ntively. (19-year-old male)\nA perceived lack of honesty was a consistent\ntheme throughout many of our interviews,\nwith some of our participants mentioning this\nas one of the negative aspects of CMC. For ex-\nample,\nI guess the only negative side that I could find is\nthat there are people out there that make it a big\nego trip. They like to lie about themselves and the\nthings they talk about, and because this is not eas-\nily monitored it causes some major problems be-\ntween people on the Net. (51-year-old female)\nThis perception of dishonesty is not unwar-\nranted, as several of our participants admitted\nto lying themselves. However, a marked gen-\nder difference emerged in relation to the rea-\nsons given and the nature of these lies. Women\ntended to lie for reasons of safety:\nOh yeah. Some people just think it\u2019s open slaughter\non young girls on the Net and come meet me at such\nand such a place and you\u2019re like yeah right I don\u2019t\nthink so. You just don\u2019t give out too much infor-\nmation. You cover yourself. (20-year-old female)\nWHITTY AND GAVIN628\nIn contrast, such reasons were rarely men-\ntioned as mitigating reasons for men\u2019s lies:\nThey all think I\u2019m a six foot tall tanned lifesaver.\nI tell them certain things that are true, but other\nthings are bull****. I mean, I can get away with it\nso why not? What they don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt\nthem. I will admit that I am pretty sly when it\ncomes to smooth talking certain ladies on the Net\nand if it means lying to get to second base then go\nfor it. (22-year-old male)\nThis young man appears to personify the pop-\nular argument that Internet relationships are\nshallow and \u201cmeaningless.\u201d3 However, the\nbravado exhibited by this participant paints\nhim as the exception rather than the rule. On\nthe whole, the lies of most men did not signify\na shallow relationship with others on the Net,\nbut, paradoxically, opened a space for a deeper\nlevel of engagement with others. As one 17-\nyear-old male participant articulated it, the per-\nceived lack of honesty on the Net \u201ccan work\nboth ways.\u201d This idea is clearly expressed in\nthe following interview extracts:\nYou can never be sure that anyone you talk to on\nthe Net is telling the truth so there\u2019s very little\ntrust. That can work both ways because you\u2019re free\nto be whatever you like, which means you\u2019re not\nintimidated by what people think. (17-year-old\nmale)\nYou also lose the ability to be able to judge people\u2019s\nhonesty effectively. It\u2019s a lot easier to do that in per-\nson, um, but there\u2019s a certain advantage to it. You\nlose your inhibitions, your insecurities. You can\ntalk a lot more easily to people. It\u2019s a bit of an even\ncut of pros and cons. (29-year-old male)\nSuch statements support previous research in-\ndicating that computer users report less self-con-\nsciousness and awareness of being socially eval-\nuated, which in turn allows intimate self-\nrevelation while maintaining distance and per-\nsonal space.18 Specifically it supports Turkle\u2019s18\nconclusion that it is a feeling of anonymity that\nallows for increased risk-taking with revelations.\nMany of the male participants believed that by\ndisguising their identity, they could be more\nemotionally honest and open. As Cooper and\nSportolari12 (p. 11) argue, \u201cthe safety and space\navailable for online interactions on the net allows\npeople a chance to experiment with putting nor-\nmally inhibited parts of themselves forward.\u201d\nMoreover, Parks and Roberts17 compare this\nphenomenon to Thibaut and Kelley\u2019s19\n\u201cstranger-on-the-train\u201d theory; whereby people\nfeel more comfortable disclosing to someone that\nthey will probably never meet again.\nFor the young men in our study, this unique\nsense of safety and space is called forth by the\nsense of anonymity that the Internet engenders.\nThis sense of anonymity is maintained by the\nwhite lies that people tell each other on the Net.\nOh, man, I have lied about f***ing everything\u2014my\nage, my name, what I do, and that type of sh**. I\nguess I mainly bull**** about the things that would\ngive away who I am. (21-year-old male)\nAh . . . I lied about where I lived because someone\nI was actually talking [chatting] to lived very close\nto me and I didn\u2019t want her to find out who I was.\n(20-year-old)\nLea and Spears7 distinguish between two\ntypes of anonymity in online communication:\nanonymity of others to the person and\nanonymity of the self to others. They refer to\nthe latter type of anonymity as \u201cidentifiability.\u201d\nFor our participants both types of anonymity\nshape the space in which they can be them-\nselves; however, it is only in relation to identi-\nfiability that these participants actively tell lies.\nThese participants tell white lies to maintain\nidentifiability, and once established this type of\nanonymity opens up the space for them to be\nmore \u201ctruthful\u201d than they would otherwise be\nface to face.\nIf you don\u2019t want anyone to know who you are,\nyou can basically say and do anything you like. It\nalso seems easier to open up to people because\nyou can\u2019t see them, you know what I mean? It\u2019s\nlike because they\u2019re not in front of you, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter how you look or sound because it all reduces\ndown to words. (17-year-old male)\nThis quote is interesting also because it supports\nthe claim of Lea and Spears7 that \u201c[t]he visual\nanonymity of the communicators and the lack of\nco-presence of the communication add to the in-\nteraction possibilities, and for some this is the\n\u2018magic\u2019 of on-line relationships\u201d (p. 202). In fact,\na very strong sense of \u201cvisual anonymity\u201d runs\nSOCIAL CUES IN ONLINE RELATIONSHIPS 629\nthrough many of our participants\u2019 accounts of the\n\u201cfreedom\u201d opened up by the Net.\nThere are no limits because people can\u2019t see\nyou and you are anonymous. I feel more comfort-\nable speaking about anything on the Net compared\nto real life. (19-year-old)\n. . . because people are just you know, you\u2019re not\njust there sort of to, all you have to do is talk, no-\nbody sees you, so there\u2019s no inhibitions in a\nchat room, everybody\u2019s just like, there\u2019s messages\nleft, right and center, everyone says whatever they\nwant to say. (19-year-old male)\nCONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, questions about \u201cbandwidth\u201d\nand the differences between face to face and\nonline communication, although interesting,\nfail to appreciate fully the shared nature of\nthese practices. The ideals that are important\nin traditional relationships, such as trust, hon-\nesty, and commitment, are equally important\nonline, but the cues that signify these ideals\nare different. For example, lying does not nec-\nessarily signify deception on the part of the\nliar, but instead can signify a desire to reveal\na deeper level of truth about the self. Similarly,\nphoning an online partner does not necessar-\nily indicate a dissatisfaction with online com-\nmunications, but instead can signify a greater\ncommitment to the relationship. The ways\nthese cues are taken up and appropriated by\nonline users to construct the meanings of their\nonline relationships highlights the need to in-\nvestigate, not just the medium itself, but the\nsocial practices going on between people\nwithin this medium.\nREFERENCES\n1.
