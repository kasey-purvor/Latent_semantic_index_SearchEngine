Recent \nscholarship in economics finds that high diversity leads to lower provision of public goods. \nAt the same time, many conflict studies find that highly diverse societies face a lower risk of \ncivil war. We explore whether diversity prompts governments to militarize heavily in order to \nprevent armed conflict, which would then crowd out spending on other public goods in a \n\u2018guns versus butter\u2019 trade off. Yet we find the opposite: higher levels of ethnic diversity \npredict lower levels of militarization. If high diversity lowers the hazard of civil war, as many \nfind, then it does not happen via preventive militarization. If diverse societies spend less on \npublic goods, then this is not because they are crowded out by security concerns. Our results \nsupport those who suggest that diversity may in fact pose a lower security threat to states. \n 2 \nThere are two important strands of theoretical and empirical scholarship on the effects of \nethnic, linguistic and religious diversity on state behavior. First, scholars interested in \ngovernance and public spending find that heterogeneity leads to lower provision of public \ngoods, such as education, health, and infrastructure. Since diversity apparently poses \nproblems for arriving at a consensus for co-operative solutions (a question of governance \nunder diverse preferences), the greater the diversity the worse the policy outcomes (Alesina et \nal. 1999; Alesina et al. 2003; Easterly 2001). Secondly, cultural heterogeneity takes a \nprominent place in debates over the causes of violent conflict (Cederman and Girardin 2007; \nFearon et al. 2007; Fox 2004; Gilley 2004; Gurr 1993; Horowitz 1998; Reynal-Querol 2002; \nVarshney 2001).1 The focus on religion in particular intensified following the 9\/11 terrorist \nattacks in the US, although the tradition of explaining violent conflict in developing countries \nin the years after World War II as ethno-nationalist rebellion has deep roots (Drake 1957; \nGurr 1970; Huntington 1968). The popular wisdom is that ethnic and, if less so, religious \nconflict is \u2018endemic\u2019 and \u2018everywhere on the rise\u2019.2 The vast majority of empirical evidence \nsuggests, however, that ethnic and religious fractionalization does not predict a higher risk of \ncivil war (Fearon and Laitin 2003; Mueller 2000). If anything, high diversity makes countries \nsafer (Wimmer and Min 2006), or in other words, ethnic dominance (Collier and Hoeffler \n2004a) or ethnic polarization (Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005) is what matters for the \nhazard of civil war, not ethnic fractionalization. Nonetheless, theories built around such \n                                                 \n1\n It is reported that one English-language scholarly journal database records 249 articles published since 1990 \ncontaining \u2018ethnic conflict\u2019 in the title as opposed to just 23 with \u2018class conflict\u2019 (Gilley 2004: 1155). Some argue \nthat \u2018ethnic conflict\u2019 is a myth and that the role of ethnicity in conflict is highly exaggerated, leading to flawed \npolicy prescriptions with dangerous consequences (Gagnon 2004). \n2\n See Kaplan (1994) for a recent explication of the primordialist argument that suggests ethnic and, more broadly, \ncultural conflict to be endemic. Huntington\u2019s (1993, 1996) hypothesis of a Clash of Civilizations provides a related \nargument. Others report that the incidence of ethnic conflict and inter-communal violence is declining (Gurr 2000). \n 3 \nconcepts as ethnic hatred and ethnic security dilemmas are prominent in the literature \n(Kaufmann 1996; Petersen 2001; Posen 1993; Snyder and Jervis 1999; Walter and Snyder \n1999). Ethnic and religious conflict occurs because groups are unable to coordinate mutual \nsecurity fears (Woodward 1995), manage underlying social frictions, and accommodate \nnationalist demands (Cederman and Girardin 2005; Wimmer 1997; Wolff 2006).3 Clearly, the \nissue of ethnic diversity\u2019s effect on state behaviour is not just interesting for theory building. \nMuch international and local policy is currently focused on achieving viable peace and \ndevelopment strategies in heterogeneous populations, most notably in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nwhere issues of cultural representation dominate political discourse. \nWe explore whether there is a link between the two strands of literature. Specifically, \nethnic diversity could lead to security concerns to which governments respond with higher \n\u2018preventive militarization\u2019. Since high fractionalization might pose a readily-observable \nsecurity threat, perhaps governments over-compensate the security risks, neglecting other \npublic goods? This may account for why some countries have high diversity and no conflict, \nwhile simultaneously having lower public goods. In other words, does ethnic diversity lead to \nhigher militarization, thus crowding out the provision of non-security public goods in a \nspecial kind of guns-versus-butter trade-off? We test this issue empirically, employing \nseveral measures of ethnic and cultural diversity and polarization on three indicators of state \nmilitarization, namely military expenditures, the share of military personnel in the labor \nforce, and arms imports. Additionally, we employ a measure of ethnic exclusion, currently \nonly available for a limited group of countries (Cederman and Girardin 2007). \n                                                 \n3\n Some find a monotonic positive effect between ethnic diversity and conflict in some estimations (Ellingsen 2000; \nSambanis 2001, 2004). We are in no position to evaluate the reasons for the discrepant findings, but note that the \nvast majority of evidence points in the direction that ethnic diversity lowers the hazard of civil war. The debate \nbetween those who see ethnicity as crucial for understanding conflict and those who see it as epiphenomenal \nfurther justifies why one needs to test the effect of ethnic diversity on militarization. \n 4 \nOur results are easily summarized. We find that heterogeneity predicts lower, rather \nthan higher, levels of military spending to GDP between 1988 and 2002, controlling for \nseveral salient factors, such as country size, income, regime type, security risks, armed \nconflict etc. If states fear ethnic diversity, or if heterogeneity drives dangerous social \nfrictions, it does not show in terms of how states prepare to deal with this. The results are \nrobust to sample size and several different specifications and testing procedures. Ethnic \nheterogeneity is also negatively related to the share of military personnel in the total labor \nforce. Since most poor countries are likely to follow more labor-intensive security strategies, \nthis result too is instructive. Ethnic diversity also reduces the share of arms imports in total \nimports. Religious heterogeneity has no statistically significant effect in any of the tests, \nwhich confirms existing studies that fail to find an effect of religious heterogeneity on either \ngrowth or institutional quality. In one set of estimations, it seems to be linguistic rather than \nethnic heterogeneity that diminishes militarization, but Alesina et al.\u2019s (2003) measure of \nlinguistic fractionalization is highly correlated with ethnic fractionalization. In the case of \nmilitarization, we find that it is heterogeneity that matters, and not polarization, as some have \nargued (e.g., Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005). \nThe results taken together do not suggest that governments \u2018run scared\u2019 because of \nethnic and other diversity \u2013 quite the opposite. They throw into doubt the notion that minority \nethnic groups in ethnically diverse societies need to fear high state militarization when they \nrebel for autonomy. Neither do the results support a conjecture that heterogeneous societies \nremain peaceful because states militarize to prevent violent conflict. Realist theories in \nparticular argue that ethnic conflict in Eastern and Central Europe was kept in check by \nSoviet military might, only to erupt with the withdrawal of Soviet power (Huntington 1993; \nMearsheimer 1990). If in fact diversity is a source of potential violent conflict, it does not \nseem likely that peace prevails because of a \u2018garrison state\u2019 effect. We find exactly the \nopposite of this expectation regarding state behavior under conditions of ethnic and other \n 5 \ndiversity. Our results therefore do not suggest that militarization crowds out public goods \nunder conditions of diversity either. Similar to the problems diverse societies encounter for \nthe provision of public goods, it seems that they may have difficulties collecting the taxes, \nforging political support, or reaching the social consensus required for militarization. This \ndoes not mean we would advocate militarization as a solution, but rather that governments do \nnot seem to act the way we think would be a rational response to real and\/or perceived threats \nemanating from ethnic diversity. \n \nEthnic Diversity, Public Goods, and Armed Conflict \nEthnic and other forms of diversity are not only interesting because of their supposed links to \nviolent conflict. Research suggests that it adversely affects economic development and public \npolicy outcomes as well. Ethnic heterogeneity (and polarization) is seen as the underlying \ncause of the failure of collective action, particularly as it generates incentives for rent-seeking \n(Alesina 1994; Alesina and Drazen 1991; Alesina and Rodrik 1994; Garcia-Montalvo and \nReynal-Querol 2005; Posner 2004). Political economy models suggest that heterogeneity is \n\u201cprone to competitive rent-seeking by the different groups that have difficulty agreeing on \npublic goods like infrastructure, education, and good policies\u201d (Easterly and Levine 1997: 2). \nThis phenomenon has been demonstrated at various levels of aggregation \u2013 see, for example, \nAlesina, Baqir and Easterly\u2019s (1999) study of the negative impact of ethnic fractionalization \non public good spending in U.S. cities and Easterly and Levine\u2019s (1997) cross-national study \nexplaining Africa\u2019s growth tragedy.4 Africa\u2019s economic woes are seen as being directly \nrelated to the bad public policies as a result of ethnic heterogeneity, where political conflicts \ndriven by ethnic frictions impede good governance and sound public goods provision \n(Easterly and Levine 1997; Kimenyi 1997). Cross-national studies show that ethnic \n                                                 \n4\n Posner (2004) corrects Easterly and Levine\u2019s (1997) measure for ethnic groups that are politically relevant and \ncomes to the same conclusion. \n 6 \npolarization lowers investment, whereas religious polarization increases government \nconsumption relative to GDP (Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005). Alesina et al \n(2003), however, find that it is diversity that matters more than polarization on the question \nof poor economic policy and public goods provision, due largely to coordination failure \narising from social frictions. Possibly, the negative effects of fractionalization are mitigated \nin democracies (Collier 2001) or rather, as Easterly (2001) argues, where institutional quality \nis high, which is only weakly correlated with democracy. However, some find that \ninstitutional quality is itself negatively affected by ethnic fractionalization (Alesina et al. \n2003; Keefer and Knack 2002; Ritzen and Woolcock 2000). \nRecent studies of civil war onset show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, ethnic \ndiversity\u2019s role in violent conflict is not straightforward. Ethnicity is important of course for \norganization and mobilization of support, but conflict occurs when the opportunity for using \nlarge-scale violence is maximized (Collier et al. 2003; Collier and Hoeffler 2004a). In highly \nhomogeneous societies there is little ethnic strife, whereas a high degree of fractionalization \nprevents effective mobilization. Collier (2001) argues that highly fractionalized societies will \npose difficulties for large enough minimum winning coalitions to form that can effectively \nchallenge a state\u2019s monopoly on force. Many empirical studies suggest that there is \u2018more \nmurder in the middle,\u2019 with moderately fractionalized societies facing the greatest danger \n(Collier and Hoeffler 2004a; de Soysa 2002; Reynal-Querol 2002). Others call this \npolarization, where two equally sized groups are the most dangerous, or in other words, \nwhere moderate fractionalization prevails, since measures of polarization are at a maximum \nwhen society is made up of two groups containing 50% of the population each (Alesina et al. \n2003; Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2002). Moreover, if the largest minority is large \nenough, it is a more attractive target for expropriation by a majority, leading to polarized \nconflict and violence (Caselli and Coleman 2006).  \n 7 \nYet, there is a mechanism other than Collier\u2019s (2001) minimum winning coalition \nargument by which ethnically diverse societies might achieve civil peace. If states anticipate \na high probability of violence or ethnic challenges under conditions of heterogeneity (social \nfrictions), they might be prone to deter large-scale violence through preventive \nmilitarization.5 It is this aspect of the debate we test on militarization, only discussing the \nquestion of violent conflict as a backdrop for why militarization should matter. If diverse \nsocieties in fact engage in preventive militarization, then this could also provide one of the \nreasons why these societies under-provide public goods, thus providing a possible causal link \nbetween the two strands of literature regarding the effects of diversity on state behaviour. \nOur study is motivated by mainly two interrelated concerns. The first is theoretical \nfrom the perspective of conflict studies. If ethnic diversity is inherently dangerous, then do \nstates prepare to meet it via militarization? If ethnic heterogeneity does not seem to matter in \nterms of the outbreak of civil war, is this because states suppress conflict effectively by \nincreasing military capacity? Secondly, is the strong empirical association relating ethnic \ndivisions to lower levels of public good provision related to higher militarization? Do states \nrespond to the ethnic diversity \u2018threat\u2019 via militarization, thus crowding out other public \ngoods? In fact, several scholars treat military spending as a public good both regionally and \nwithin countries because if it in fact buys security, then others benefit from having to spend \nless given the regional nature of the consequences (Collier and Hoeffler 2002; Olson 1982). \nOur analysis is designed to answer these questions. \n \n                                                 \n5\n Collier and Hoeffler (2004c) do not find that higher military spending deters civil conflict, whilst Collier and \nHoeffler (2004b) even show that higher spending might increase rather than reduce the risk of renewed conflict in \npost-conflict societies. Yet, many policy makers all over the world seem to think that militarization is needed for \nconflict prevention. \n 8 \nResearch Design \nWe employ a pooled time-series, cross-section (TSCS) data set. Our main dependent variable \nconsists of military expenditures over GDP (Military expenditures). We keep this variable in \nits level form, but our main results are hardly affected if it is logged instead. Others also \nreport this finding (Collier and Hoeffler 2004c). The data are taken from the World \nDevelopment Indicators CD-Rom (World Bank 2004), which is also the source for the other \nvariables unless noted otherwise. They are available annually from 1988 up to 2002, a total of \n15 years. Combining various sources one could in principle construct a panel that reaches \nfurther back in time. However, given measurement and international and inter-temporal \ncomparability problems with military expenditure data, particularly during the period of the \nCold War (Brzoska 1995), we prefer to use one single data source that largely covers only the \npost-Cold War period. The recent data are also much more reliable given improved standards \nfor collecting data and higher levels of transparency due to democratization and international \npressure (Omitoogun 2003). The World Bank data are almost identical to data supplied to us \ndirectly by SIPRI (r = 0.98).  \nIn addition, we use two other variables capturing aspects of militarization to build \nrobustness. The second dependent variable is military personnel as a share of the total labor \nforce (Military personnel). The advantage of using the share of military personnel is that poor \ncountries may simply use labor-intensive (rather than capital-intensive) forms of \nmilitarization. Finally, we use arms imports relative to total imports (Arms imports). This \nvariable is only available up to 1999, and in principle arms import expenditures should be \nincluded in total military expenditures. However, for some countries arms imports are not \n 9 \naccounted for in military expenditures (Brzoska 1995) and a high arms to total imports ratio \nprovides yet another feature of militarization. These data are from (World Bank 2003).6 \nOur primary independent variable is ethnic heterogeneity (Alesina et al. 2003; Fearon \n2003). This measure is defined as the probability that two randomly selected individuals from \nthe same country belong to different ethnic or linguistic groups, computed as \n\u2211\n=\n\u2212\u2261\nn\ni\nipELF\n1\n21 , where pi is the population share of ethnic or linguistic group i and n is the \nnumber of existing groups. These data are based on more current, updated sources, and do not \nconflate ethnic, religious and linguistic characteristics in a single measure as blatantly as the \nold ELF measure based on Soviet ethnographic studies during the 1960s (Fearon 2003). They \nalso rely on survey-based studies that have examined several African countries, where \ndistinction of groups is not always straightforward. Fearon (2003: 196) claims that his \nmeasure is \u2018broadly similar\u2019 to Alesina et al\u2019s (2003) measure. Both these measures are \nhighly similar to Montalvo and Reynal-Querol\u2019s (2005). In addition to these three sources, \nRoeder (2001) has developed an ethnolinguistic fractionalization index, which is mainly \nbased on the original Soviet sources from the 1960s together with other Soviet ethnographic \nstudies from the 1980s. \nAdditionally, Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005) argue that it is polarization rather \nthan fractionalization that matters. Polarization measures \u201cthe normalized distance of a \nparticular distribution of ethnic and religious groups from a bimodal distribution\u201d (see \nMontalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005: 301 for details). It is computed as \n\u2211\n=\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2261\nn\ni\ni\ni p\np\nP\n1 5.\n5.\n1 , where pi is again the population share of group i and n is the number \n                                                 \n6\n There is one data point of more than 100 per cent (Ethiopia 1989), which can happen if there are inconsistencies \nin the reporting and measurement of arms as well as total imports. Dropping this observation from the sample had \nlittle impact on the results. \n 10 \nof existing groups. Polarization approaches unity when the population is made up of two \nequally sized groups and then declines as the number of groups increases further, whereas \nfractionalization increases monotonically with the number of groups. Empirically, across \ncountries ethnic polarization is related to ethnic fractionalization in a non-linear way: Ethnic \npolarization first rises with increasing fractionalization, but then falls at an intermediate level \nof fractionalization. Religious polarization is somewhat different. It first increases as \nfractionalization increases and then at higher levels of fractionalization there is no \nrelationship to polarization. See Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005) for a detailed \ndiscussion. Table 1 provides a correlation matrix for the various measures of fractionalization \nand polarization used. There is clearly often strong correlation among the various measures, \nbut they are far from identical. We use the conservative strategy of testing all these measures \nto ensure robustness of our results, a strategy advocated by both Fearon (2003) and Alesina et \nal. (2003). \nIn a recent debate on the importance of ethnicity for predicting conflict, Cederman \nand Girardin (2007) argued that fractionalization measures are not a good way of capturing \nwhy ethnic grievances matter for conflict (see also Fearon et al. 2007). They propose that \nwhat matters is not ethnic diversity as such, but the exclusion of ethnic groups from state \npower. They construct a measure of ethnic exclusion based on the size of the ethnic groups \nthat do not share in government, which they call N-star. The smaller the size of the ethnic \ngroup in power, the greater the chances of violence. We use their measure of N-star to test \nalso this aspect of ethnicity on state militarization in sensitivity analysis. Do ethnic minorities \nin power use their access to state resources to insure their predominance through \nmilitarisation? \nThere is an enormous theoretical and empirical literature that has accumulated on the \ncauses and consequences of military spending (Gleditsch et al. 2000; Hartley and Hooper \n1990). Most of these studies have focused on arms races between the superpowers, or are \n 11 \ncase studies of single countries over time. We rely primarily on two recent empirical studies \naddressing the determinants of military spending, namely Collier and Hoeffler\u2019s (2004b) \nstudy of military expenditures in five-year averaged periods from 1960-1999 and \nGoldsmith\u2019s (2003) study of military spending over the period 1886 to 1989, neither of which \naddresses ethnic and other diversity. \nWe control for the level of per capita income in purchasing power parity (Gross \nNational Income p.c.) as well as its growth rate (Economic growth per capita), which are \ncommonly used variables (Davoodi et al. 2001; Goldsmith 2003; Gupta et al. 2001). We log \nGross National Income per capita to reduce skewness. Most find that income is positively \nrelated to higher expenditures, arguing that wealth allows governments the greater luxury of \nstronger defense (Collier and Hoeffler 2004c). In economic terms, military spending is likely \nto be a normal good, that is a good with a positive income elasticity (Sandler and Hartley \n1995). High economic growth rates might make it easier for governments to impose a greater \ndefense burden on society. We use total population (logged) to control for country size \nbecause this influences both ethnic heterogeneity and militarization (Population size). Collier \nand Hoeffler (2004b) report a negative effect of country size as measured by population on \nmilitary budgets, arguing that large countries deter external threats. We control for regime \ntype (Democracy) using the POLITY IV dataset\u2019s polity2 indicator, which uses a weighting \nscheme to treat periods of transition (www.cidcm.umd.edu\/inscr\/polity\/). We expect \nautocracies to have higher military spending than democracies (Collier and Hoeffler 2002; \nGoldsmith 2003). Many have argued that autocracies are dependent on military force to \nsustain their rule, whereas democracies command a greater degree of legitimacy and are less \nin need of a strong military (Kimenyi and Mbaku 1995; Maizels and Nissanke 1986). We \nadditionally control for overall government spending per GDP (Government expenditures), \nsince high government consumption generally will have the same causes as high military \nspending. \n 12 \nNext, we control for internal and external security threats, which should impact \nmilitarization (Collier and Hoeffler 2004c). We enter a term for Civil war, which is a dummy \nvariable for years in which a country experiences armed conflict with over 25 battle-related \ndeaths (Gleditsch et al. 2002). Following Goldsmith (2003), the international war variable is a \ndummy for years in which a country engages in conflict between states with at least 1000 \ndeaths (International war). These data are taken from (Gleditsch et al. 2002). We also \ncompute a count of civil and international peace years (Peace years (civil war) and Peace \nyears (int. war)), or the simple count of the number of years since the last civil and \ninternational war since 1946 (Collier and Hoeffler 2004c). It is well established that, for civil \nwars at least, there is a high risk of revival, which suggests that militarization after the end of \ncivil war is likely to diminish only slowly over time (Collier and Hoeffler 2004b). Civil wars \ncould also be endogenous to militarization. High military expenditures can deter international \nconflicts, but can also provoke them due to fears among neighbors (Fordham and Walker \n2005). High military expenditures can signal to rebels that the initiation of a civil war is \nlikely to end in defeat, but particularly in fragile post-conflict societies high expenditures can \nalso increase the risk of renewed conflict if the former rebels take such expenditures as a \nsignal of the bad faith of a government (Collier and Hoeffler 2004c). For these reasons, we \nrun tests with and without the civil war variables (incidence and peace years) included. \nSimilar to Collier and Hoeffler (2004b) we take a weighted average level of \nmilitarization of countries that are \u201ccontiguous\u201d (Neighborhood militarization). The weight is \nGDP and contiguity is defined as either land contiguity or water contiguity up to 400 miles of \nwater. Data are from the Correlates of War (COW) project and were taken from Bennett and \nStam (Bennet and Stam 2003). In a context of rivalry, the level of militarization of \ncontiguous countries can capture local arms race phenomena. In a context of non-rivalry, it \ncan capture emulation, imitation and coordination effects. The contiguous militarization \nvariable is not without problems, however. In effect, it introduces a spatial lag into the model \n 13 \n(Anselin 1998) and often captures variables omitted from the model (Simmons and Elkins \n2004). We believe our model is relatively comprehensive, but it would be difficult to say with \nconfidence that there are no omitted variables. For this reason, we run tests with and without \nthe contiguous militarization variables. \nContrary to Collier and Hoeffler (2004b), we do not include a measure of predicted \ncivil war. Such a variable creates all kinds of statistical problems. Instead, we control for the \nrisk of civil war directly by our range of explanatory variables, which will capture the risk of \ncivil war under the assumption that the factors triggering such war are time-persistent. \nFinally, we include year-specific dummies to capture any trends over time and year-specific \ninternational tension that influence defense spending globally, such as the end of the Cold \nWar, the Persian Gulf War, and NATO action in the Balkans. Table 2 provides descriptive \nstatistics of the variables. \nThe estimation of TSCS data presents some special problems, particularly because of \ncomplex correlation patterns between and across panels (Beck and Katz 1995a, 1995b). Since \nour data is unbalanced to an extent that no time periods are common to all countries in the \nsample, the standard version of the Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) method of Beck \nand Katz cannot be used. As an alternative, we use a random-effects estimator with robust \nstandard errors, assuming that observations are independent across countries, but not \nnecessarily within countries over time, i.e. observations are clustered by units. The robust-\ncluster option produces consistent standard errors even in the presence of serial correlation \nand heteroskedasticity, but it is potentially inefficient in estimation (Wiggins 1999). To \nensure that results are not specific to our estimation technique, we additionally use the \nGeneralized Estimation Equation method (GEE) (Zorn 2001), also under the assumption of \nclustered observations.  \n \n 14 \nResults \nTable 3 presents the results for militarization with Fearon and Laitin\u2019s (2003) measures of \nethnic and religious heterogeneity. Note that year-specific time dummies are included in the \nestimations, but their coefficients are not reported. Column 1 reports results with random-\neffects (cluster option) and column 2 reports results using the GEE method.7 As seen there, \nethnic heterogeneity is negatively related to militarization across all three measures of \nmilitarization. Religious heterogeneity is not statistically significantly different from zero in \nany of the estimations. Substantively, holding all other variables at their mean values, raising \nethnic heterogeneity by one standard deviation would reduce the share of military \nexpenditures in GDP by almost three-quarter\u2019s of a percent (0.71), which is quite large given \nthat the global average military burden is only 2.9% of GDP. \nWhat about our control variables? Contrary to Goldsmith (2003) who tests a longer \ntime period, we do not find that higher per capita income predicts higher defense spending, \nbut a higher economic growth rate allows countries to engage in higher military spending. \nThis difference in results might suggest some influence from the Cold War period that \ndominates other tests. Developed and Eastern European countries have on average reduced \ntheir military spending after the end of the Cold War, whereas developing countries have not, \nor if they have, by smaller degrees. Democracy has a negative and statistically significant \nimpact on military spending, supporting Goldsmith\u2019s (2003) and Collier and Hoeffler\u2019s \n(2004b) findings. Democratic governments are able, independently of the level of \nfractionalization, wealth, and other controls, to focus a larger share of resources to other \npriorities than security. This result is not likely to be driven mainly by the fact that \ndemocracies thrive in peaceful neighborhoods and autocrats thrive in violent ones, which can \n                                                 \n7\n Collinearity among the variables does not seem to be a problem. The average Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) \nscore is around 2 in column 1. \n 15 \nbe deduced from the fact that we control for violent conflict.8 Larger government \nconsumption is also positively related to higher military expenditure. Military spending by \ncontiguous countries and the incidence of civil war show the expected positive sign and are \nstatistically significant, results that are also consistent with other studies (Goldsmith 2003; \nGupta et al. 2001). Military expenditures decrease with a longer history of civil peace. \nPerhaps surprisingly, neither the incidence nor the history of international conflict seems to \nmatter for military spending. \nWith respect to military personnel as a share of the labor force, neither per capita \nincome nor the economic growth rate has a statistically significant impact. Democracy shows \na statistically significant negative effect on the share of labor devoted to security. Not \nsurprisingly, population size is negatively related to military personnel as a share of the labor \nforce, since countries with a large population need to allocate a smaller share of the labor \nforce to military duties, but still retaining a large military in absolute numbers. Higher \nmilitarization by contiguous neighbors leads to higher militarization within the country. A \nlonger history of civil peace leads to lower military personnel, whereas the opposite is true \nfor the incidence of international war. This result is reasonable, as it is the rich countries that \nlargely fight international wars (as in Kosovo and the Persian Gulf) and simultaneously \nmaintain more capital intensive defense postures. \nFinally, regarding arms imports as a share of total imports, we find that higher arms \nimports by contiguous neighbors as well as the incidence and history of civil and \ninternational war have the predicted effect on a country\u2019s arms imports. Democracies import \nfewer arms than autocracies, but the effect is marginally insignificant in random-effects \nestimation. Surprisingly, arms imports are lower in countries with a higher per capita income. \n                                                 \n8\n There is a large literature on the democratic peace (Russett and Oneal 2001) and questions relating to spatial \neffects of neighborhoods and democracy (Gleditsch and Ward 2004; O'Loughlin et al. 1998). \n 16 \nAn explanation could be that richer countries are able to produce a larger share of their \narmaments domestically. Government expenditure is positively associated with arms imports, \nwhereas population size and the economic growth rate do not matter. \nIn tables 4 to 6, we repeat the tests conducted above, but this time using alternative \nmeasures of heterogeneity. Estimations using Montalvo and Reynal-Querol\u2019s (2005) \nmeasures of ethnic and religious fractionalization are reported in table 4. They mirror the \nresults using Fearon\u2019s (2003) and Fearon and Laitin\u2019s (2003) measures: More ethnically \nfractionalized societies have lower military spending and lower arms imports, whereas \nreligious fractionalization does not matter. The substantive effect of a standard deviation \nincrease in fractionalization reduces the defense burden by almost one-half of a percent. The \nmain difference to results in table 3 is that ethnic fractionalization, while being negatively \nsigned, has no statistically significant effect on military personnel as a share of the labor \nforce. Results from the main estimations reported in table 3 uphold if Roeder\u2019s (2001) \nethnolinguistic fractionalization index is used instead, with results reported in table 5. Alesina \net al.\u2019s (2003) measures of ethnic, linguistic and religious fractionalization are tested in table \n6. As seen there, it is linguistic fractionalization that has the strongest negative and \nstatistically significant effect on military expenditures and arms imports, although it is not \nstatistically significant for military personnel. Religious fractionalization exerts a negative \nand statistically significant impact on military personnel, however. Ethnic fractionalization \nremains insignificant across the dimensions. We re-ran all tests by dropping linguistic \nfractionalization because it is highly correlated with ethnic fractionalization, but the results \ndo not change much. This result is plausible because it is Alesina et al.\u2019s (2003) linguistic \nrather than ethnic fractionalization which is most highly correlated with Fearon and Laitin\u2019s \nethnic fractionalization measure (r = 0.88 as opposed to r = 0.76).  \nLinguistic issues are potentially most explosive because questions concerning national \nlanguage and school curricula determine the economic chances of people (Horowitz 2000), \n 17 \nbut the fact that states do not militarize under linguistic diversity suggests that the consensus \nnecessary for such spending is difficult under these conditions. To test whether the linguistic \ndifference between the two largest groups matter, we now test Fearon\u2019s (2003) measure of \ncultural fractionalization that adjusts his measure of ethnic fractionalization for the cultural \ndistance between the ethnic groups using linguistic classifications of distance between major \nlanguage families. For example, if ethnic groups belong to two distinct language families, \nsuch as Greek and Turkish, then the cultural distance is greater compared to two groups \nspeaking Slavic East branch and Slavic West branch. Indeed, Fearon (2003: 215) argues that \n\u201cif a researcher\u2019s theory is that ethnic fractionalization matters because it makes for diverse \npreferences and consequent difficulties cooperating, then the measure of cultural \nfractionalization (...) may be more appropriate.\u201d Alesina et al (2003) concur. Table 7 repeats \nthe estimations from table 3, but replacing ethnic with cultural fractionalization (Cultural \nfraction). This variable is negatively signed, but only statistically significant for military \npersonnel, and then only in GEE estimation. It is only marginally insignificant in columns 1 \nto 3, however. These results, too, however, do not suggest that cultural distance based on \nlanguage similarity matters for predicting the degree of state militarization. \n \nSensitivity analysis \nWe ran our models with several alternative conceptualizations of ethnicity followed by a \nnumber of robustness checks on our basic results.9 We test ethnic and religious polarization \nand a measure of ethnic exclusion from state power. First, we replaced the fractionalization \nwith Montalvo and Reynal-Querol\u2019s (2005) polarization measures. Neither ethnic nor \nreligious polarization has any impact on militarization, regardless of the dependent variable \nused. These results do not support the proposition that it is polarization rather than \n                                                 \n9\n These results will be made available as a web appendix upon publication. \n 18 \nfractionalization that really matters for predicting militarization. Next, we entered Cederman \nand Girardin\u2019s (2007) measure of ethnic exclusion (N-star). If ethnic groups excluded from \nstate power are most likely to rebel as Cederman and Girardin (2007) argue, then do ethnic \nminority governments respond to this threat via increased militarization? The coefficients of \nthis variable switched between positive and negative in the models tested, but none of them at \nany time came close to being statistically significant. We thus find no association between \nethnic exclusion from state power and militarization. Others have shown that this measure is \nnot a robust predictor of civil war either (Fearon et al. 2007). However, it is too early to come \nto a definite conclusion on this measure as the N-star variable is currently only available for \nEurasia and North Africa and does not yet account for changes in the ethnic composition of \nstate power over time. We intend to revisit this important question when an updated measure \nthat is spatially and temporally more comprehensive.10 \nWe dropped the contiguous militarization and conflict variables to assess the effects \nof ethnic heterogeneity without them in the model, since these variables might suffer from \nendogeneity bias. When these variables are dropped, the basic results on most of the \nheterogeneity variables change little, but the heterogeneity variables from Montalvo and \nReynal-Querol (2003) and the linguistic fractionalization variable from Alesina et al. (2003) \nbecome statistically insignificant, while maintaining their negative coefficient sign. The \ngovernment expenditure variable suffers from partial identity bias since current military \nexpenditures form part of general government expenditure. Unfortunately, current military \nexpenditures cannot be netted out from general government expenditure since the available \nmilitary expenditure data include both capital formation and current expenditures for military \npurposes. If we drop government expenditures from the model, then our results are hardly \naffected. To see whether ethnic and religious heterogeneity exerts a non-linear influence on \n                                                 \n10\n Cederman and Girardin are currently working on such an update (personal communication). \n 19 \nmilitary spending, we repeated the estimations with squared and, in separate estimations, \neven cubic heterogeneity terms included. However, we found no evidence for non-linear \nrelationships.  \nWe followed Goldsmith (2003) and controlled for the previous year\u2019s value of the \ndependent variable. One can argue that military budget decisions are subject to bureaucratic \ninertia (Goldsmith 2003; Gupta et al. 2001). Results on our main variables of interest are little \naffected in terms of the sign of the coefficient and statistical significance when entering a \nlagged dependent variable. We tried to capture some crude cross-regional heterogeneity by \nemploying regional dummies. We use the regional classification provided in the World \nDevelopment Indicators CD-rom version (World Bank 2004). With the exception of North \nAfrica and Middle East, which often showed a higher level of militarization, there was little \nevidence for systematic regional differences. Our main results were hardly affected with the \nexception of the heterogeneity variables derived from Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2003) \nand Alesina et al. (2003), which sometimes became (marginally) insignificant, while \nmaintaining their negative coefficient sign.  \nNext, we added further control variables. Contrary to others, the share of the \npopulation urbanized had little effect on the results (Davoodi et al. 2001). The same is true \nfor the level of aid to gross national income, which might ease the budget constraint. One \nmight wonder whether oil wealth might allow governments to achieve greater levels of \nmilitarization. Adding a dummy variable taking the value of one if oil exports reach one third \nof total GDP (Fearon and Laitin 2003), suggests no impact on military expenditures or \nmilitary personnel, but oil has a positive and statistically significant effect on arms imports. \nThis result is reasonable because major oil exporters, such as the Persian Gulf countries, have \nbeen major arms importers during the study period. The results on the remaining variables \nwere hardly affected, however. The same is true if we add a dummy variable for the 20 \nlargest arms-producing countries based on information from SIPRI to the arms imports \n 20 \nregressions (SIPRI 2002). Major arms producers import fewer arms, as expected. Our main \nresults remain valid. Finally, we limited our analyses to a sub-sample of only developing \ncountries. The results on diversity remain very similar. In sum, there is no indication from \nany of the tests that fractionalization increases militarization. The same is true for \npolarization. \n \nConclusions \nSeveral disciplines use ethnic diversity as an explanation for societal outcomes, ranging from \ndemocratization and governance to violent political conflict and economic performance. \nRecent empirical studies show that ethnic diversity hampers public goods provision because \nconsensus and coordination are difficult under conditions of competing preferences. In \naddition, explanations of violent conflict see ethnic diversity as problematic because it can \nlead to mutual hatred stemming from historic legacies and the fear of domination by cultural \nothers. Recent cross-national quantitative studies show, however, that ethnic diversity makes \ncountries safer. The question our study was concerned with is: do states in ethnically diverse \nsocieties engage in preventive militarization? If they did, then this could both provide a \nmechanism through which diverse societies achieve civil peace and an explanation for why \ndiversity leads to under-provision of such public goods as education and infrastructure \n(crowding out). \nOur results simply do not support this view. Militarization is actually lower under \nconditions of greater diversity measured by several different indicators. Ethno-linguistic \ndiversity in particular seems to be what matters rather than polarization. If in fact, as some \nfind, ethnicized armed violence is most likely when two groups are of similar size, then it is \nnot likely that militarization is the link as to why heterogeneous societies are better able to \nmaintain peace. In fact, empirical studies that have tested the direct effect of ethnic and other \n 21 \ndiversity on state repression have found ethnicity to have no effect, or even to lower \nrepression (de Soysa 2007; Lee et al. 2004; Walker and Poe 2002). \nIf preventive militarisation cannot explain why ethnically diverse societies are \nsurprisingly peaceful, what can? Fearon and Laitin (1996) developed theories of interethnic \ncooperation built on in-group policing and fear of spirals of conflict. Our estimations of \ngovernment behavior in the security sector under conditions of diversity support those views \nthat suggest ways in which diversity may in fact promote peaceful conflict resolution (Collier \n2001; Fearon and Laitin 1996; Gagnon 2004; Varshney 2001). Most importantly, our results \nsuggest that if greater diversity is in fact a constraint on organizing violence, then this is not a \nresult of higher state militarization. These results support those who advocate promoting \ndemocracy and diversity, not secession, as the antidote to the so-called development tragedy \nin Africa (Collier 2001).  \n 22 \nTable 1.
