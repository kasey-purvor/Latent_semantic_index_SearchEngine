Introduction \nDuring geomagnetic disturbances the geoelectric field at the Earth\u2019s surface drives \ngeomagnetically induced currents (GIC) through conductor networks, such as power grids, gas \nand oil pipelines. To investigate the flow of GIC in a given system we need to understand how \nthe geoelectric field responds to a geomagnetic disturbance (e.g. Viljanen and Pirjola, 1994). \nHowever, the geoelectric field is sensitive to variations in the Earth\u2019s resistivity (e.g. Bahr, \n1991). The UK landmass has a complex geological structure. In addition, shallow shelf seas \nsurround it, with deep ocean a few hundred kilometres to the west and continental Europe nearby \nto the east. These factors are known to influence the electromagnetic fields observed on land \n(Beamish, 1985; Ritter and Banks, 1998). Gilbert (2005) has also recently highlighted the \nrelevance of the 'coast-effect' for GIC, where the onshore electric field magnitude is enhanced \nconsiderably due to the large mismatch in the conductivities of the ocean and land. In the next \nsection we discuss some recent developments towards an accurate three dimensional \nconductivity model for the UK and the neighbouring continental shelf and, in particular, we \nestimate the large surface electric fields that occurred during the October 2003 \u2018Halloween\u2019 \ngeomagnetic storm. Magnetotelluric and Geomagnetic Deep Sounding data have been used to \nhelp refine the model, particularly in the Midland Valley region of Scotland. \n  \nIn the Midland Valley region there is an extensive 275kV and 400kV network of power lines and \ntransformers. It is well known (e.g. Boteler et al, 1998; Bolduc, 2002; Molinski, 2002; \nKappenman, 2004) that high voltage network transformers may suffer problems because of \nsaturation due to GIC (e.g. reactive power losses, AC odd and even harmonic generation, stray \nmagnetic flux heating) and the Scottish grid operator, Scottish Power plc, has installed GIC \n 4\nmonitoring equipment at four key sites in the high voltage grid. In Section 3 we describe an \nelectrical network model of this power grid. We compare model and measured GIC data at these \nand other sites and discuss the accuracy of the model. \n \nFrom these studies we have developed a GIC web tool and this is described in Section 4. The \ncomponents of this tool are a daily three-day ahead geomagnetic activity forecast (produced from \npublicly available solar and geomagnetic data), a solar wind shock monitor (using near real time \ndata from the NASA ACE spacecraft, courtesy of NOAA\/SEC), a real time geomagnetic index \nfor the UK (for monitoring storm growth and decay), and the GIC model described in Sections 2 \nand 3 (i.e. surface electric field and power network models). The web tool updates data and \ndisplays every ten minutes providing users with a full range of near real time data, for example to \naid grid management.  \n \nWe conclude in Section 5 with a summary, some observations on GIC issues, and plans for \nfuture developments. \n \nWe first review some of the other UK impacts of the severe geomagnetic storm of October 29-30 \n2003. This storm was notable in the UK not least because of the very high rates of change \nobserved in the geomagnetic field. The storm followed the eruption of two solar flares from the \nsame active region (NOAA 10486) on the 28th and 29th October 2003. The first, an X17 X-ray \nflare, was one of the largest recorded events. The second flare, an X10, erupted 33 hours later. \nBoth flares had associated Earth-directed coronal mass ejections. The first CME impacted the \nEarth's magnetosphere on 29th October 2003 after a travel time of around 19 hours. This caused \n 5\nlarge variations in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. At Lerwick observatory in Shetland, to the north of \nScotland, the magnetic compass direction varied between 0\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 west of north during the \nstorm. The disturbance continued for 20 hours and had started to decline when the second CME \narrived on 30th October 2003. Again the magnetic field variations were significant, although this \ntime the largest variations were seen further south. Remarkably, at Eskdalemuir observatory \n(situated in Southern Scotland) the magnetic compass direction changed by over 5\u00b0 in only 6 \nminutes at around 21:20 UT (see Figure 1). The aurora borealis is usually visible only at high \nUK latitudes, towards the north of Scotland. However the magnitude of these magnetic storms \ngave rise to two nights of spectacular auroral displays throughout the UK. \n \nImportantly, Eskdalemuir observatory lies within the Scottish Border region, less than 100km \nfrom a major east-west 400kV power line (Figure 2), with a termination at the Strathaven \nsubstation (STHA in Figure 2). GIC measuring equipment operated by Scottish Power at \nStrathaven recorded 42A flowing to Earth in a single transformer (three-times-phase) around the \npeak of the storm (Figure 3). Scottish Power engineers suggested that 42A, if sustained, would \ndefinitely have caused transformer problems (T. Cumming, Scottish Power, personal \ncommunication). However, the interplanetary magnetic field remained northward for much of \nthe time during the storm, inhibiting reconnection on the dayside magnetopause, and this \nprobably contributed to the few actual problems observed on the network (see also Simpson, \n2003). Transformer heating (gas production) and voltage fluctuations were observed but were \nregarded as being at manageable levels.  Post-event considerations by engineers now suggest that \na threshold level of GIC of about 25 A constitutes an approximate \u2018concern threshold\u2019 for the \nScottish Power grid operators, transmission and transformer engineers, with this particular \n 6\nsystem as it now exists. This power grid, as with many others worldwide, is in a more or less \nconstant state of evolution and this \u2018concern threshold\u2019 will undoubtedly change with time.  \n \nBeyond the UK a GIC related power outage in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, occurred at approximately 20:07 \nUT and lasted for about forty minutes (Lundstedt, 2004). The geomagnetic latitude of Malm\u00f6 is \ncomparable to that of central Scotland. Indeed, GIC in the Scottish Power grid were also \nenhanced at this time, with GIC at NEIL reaching approximately 25 A, during intensification of \na western electrojet. We note that the peak GIC observed on 30th October 2003 exceeds known \nGIC in the UK in previous storms (Beamish et al, 2002; Erinmez et al, 2002). Other \ntechnological effects, such as satellite, aviation and ground-based anomalies, of the 28th-30th \nOctober space weather event, and those that occurred throughout late October and early \nNovember 2003 (the so-called Halloween epoch events) have been reviewed elsewhere in detail. \nFor example, Webb and Allen (2004) highlight that a number of earth orbiting satellites suffered \nspontaneous Central Processor Unit resets and memory errors, and that the Federal Aviation \nAuthority took the unprecedented step of issuing an alert to airline passengers regarding the \npossibility of high radiation doses. Similarly, Barbieri and Mahmot (2004) detail both spacecraft \nanomalies and the operational effects of the space weather events. These Halloween events have \nalso been used to assess both the performance of real-time shock arrival production schemes and \nforecast accuracy (Dryer et al, 2004; Oler, 2004).     \n \n2. Modelling the Surface Electric Field in the UK \nBeamish et al (2002) described a surface electric field model for the UK, Ireland and \nsurrounding seas, based on a conductivity model comprising a six-block tectonic terrane \n 7\nstructure for the UK crustal landmass, to a 30 km depth, on top of a radially varying conductivity \nmodel of the lithosphere and upper mantle, down to 1000 km. This model also included the \nconductivity of the surrounding shelf seas (~200 m depth of water). The UK and Ireland was \nmodelled on a 20 km square grid and electric fields were estimated for plane wave inducing \nfields using finite difference equations (e.g. Mackie et al, 1994). Beamish et al (2002) considered \ntwo fixed periods of field variation, of 10 and 30 minutes, appropriate for longer period GIC \nstudies. They concluded that, for the long period variations they considered, the crustal structure \nof the UK serves to redistribute the amplitude and phase of the secondary electric field induced \nin both the crust and mantle as result of the primary electromagnetic fields of ionospheric and \nmagnetospheric origin. Large surface E-field enhancements at the terrane boundaries and at the \ncoast were noted. However, Beamish et al (2002) were forced to use a seawater resistivity that \nwas sixteen times too large, to ensure that the minimum skin depth encountered in the model was \ngreater than their choice of numerical grid spacing, which is a normal requirement of most \nelectromagnetic modelling algorithms. They highlighted that this effectively reduced the \nconductivity contrast between the sea and the land, which in turn reduced the amplitude of the \nsurface electric field due to the lateral contrast in conductivity. In addition, while the Mackie et \nal (1994) algorithm allows fully 3D variations of resistivity, the primary electromagnetic fields \nwere limited to plane-waves.   \n \nMcKay (2004) circumvented these drawbacks by modelling the electric field using the thin-sheet \napproximation (e.g. Weaver, 1982) and the modelling algorithm of Vasseur and Weidelt (1977).  \nThin-sheet modelling is particularly suited to studying geomagnetic induction where lateral \nvariations in conductivity occur in a thin sheet at, or close to, the surface of the Earth. In \n 8\naddition, a thin-sheet algorithm provides computational advantages. Only the horizontal \ncomponents of the electric field need be computed and an arbitrary primary magnetic field may \nbe considered. A full description of the construction of the UK thin-sheet model is given in \nMcKay (2004) and in a paper currently in preparation. Therefore only a brief description is given \nhere. McKay (2004) developed the model by incorporating Geomagnetic Deep Sounding (GDS) \nand Magnetotelluric (MT) data for the Midland Valley (MV), Southern Upland (SU), and the \nnorthern portion of the Concealed Caledonides (CC) terranes and by properly accounting for the \nhigh seawater conductivity, which was underestimated in the Beamish et al (2002) study. The \nimproved model includes detailed bathymetry data for the shelf seas and Atlantic Ocean and uses \na finer grid scale, at 10km. Figure 4 shows the original tectonic structure adopted for the British \nIsles by Beamish et al (2002) and the new (depth-integrated) conductance model of the ocean \nand shelf-seas of McKay (2004), which assumes a sea-water resistivity of 0.25 Ohm m. McKay \nrepresents the top-most sheet of the crustal structure of Beamish et al (2002) as a laterally \nvarying conductance map (as in Figure 4), together with new crustal scale on-shore conductivity \nvariations in the MV, SU and CC regions, chosen to enhance the agreement with measured MT \nand GDS data. Underlying this new thin layer McKay retains the 1D model of Beamish et al \n(2002).  \n \nThe relevance of a 3D model is emphasised by data in McKay (2004) that shows the distorting \neffect of a major terrane boundary on measured GIC data at the TORN site (see Figures 2 and 4) \nas well as local crustal effects at STHA. Significant regional conductance contrasts are also \nimplied by the observed azimuthal variations when telluric responses calculated from MT \nmeasurements are displayed in the form of \u2018telluric vectors\u2019. Telluric vectors are the electric \n 9\nfields associated with a unit magnetic induction linearly polarised in a north-south and east-west \ndirection (Bahr, 1991). A common problem in the interpretation of MT measurements is caused \nby the electrostatic (often referred to as galvanic) distortion of  the electric field due to \nconductivity anomalies which are much smaller than the true electromagnetic skin-depth. This \ncauses the well-known \u2018static-shift\u2019 of the MT parameter apparent resistivity, whose magnitude \nis shifted up or down by an unknown amount in a frequency independent manner.  When plotted \non a geographical map the distortion of the telluric vectors is easily recognised:  the telluric \nvectors of MT sites that are closely spaced (e.g. the site spacing is smaller than the estimated \nskin-depth) have magnitudes and azimuths that are inconsistent with neighbouring sites.  The \nregional telluric responses were therefore recovered using the method of Smith (1995). Regional \nresponses determined using such methods account for the angular distortion of the electric field \nbut it is not possible to quantify uniquely the effect on the magnitude of the electric field without \nadditional information. Figure 5 shows the telluric responses of model and measured data \n(corrected for distortion) in the MV-SU region for an east-west or north-south inducing field at \n750s period (McKay, 2004). This is roughly in the middle of the range of periods relevant to GIC \nstudies (i.e. few seconds to ~30 minutes or so). In order to extract model telluric vectors at the \nMT sites the electric field model output was interpolated onto a 1 km grid. Clearly there is a \nstrong azimuthal consistency between measured and modelled data in Figure 5, with less \nconsistency in the magnitude of the vector responses. The measured data show large local \nvariations in amplitude whereas the model data appear more locally uniform. The measured \ntelluric vectors have amplitudes up to 6.9 mV\/km per unit (nT) inducing field while the model \ndata are no more than 1.1 mV\/km. The large magnitude of the measured telluric responses is \ncorrelated over distances of approximately 10-20 km. This gives an indication of the spatial scale \n 10\nof electric field distortion in this region at a period of 750 s. This spatial-scale is similar to the \ncurrent node spacing (10 km) of the electric field model. A smaller node spacing would be \nrequired to investigate the possible effects of such large amplitude distortions.  \n \nBased on these model developments, Figure 6 presents an estimate of the surface electric field \nacross the UK and Ireland during the peak of the 30th October 2003 magnetic storm, at 21:20 UT. \nThe amplitude of the horizontal inducing field is that measured at Eskdalemuir observatory, at \n1400 nT and oriented slightly east of south at that time. We have assumed a driving period of six \nminutes on the basis of the north field component profile around 21:20 UT. A north-south \ngradient in the amplitude of the primary inducing field was also imposed on the basis that the \namplitude of the geomagnetic disturbance in the northern region of the UK was two to three \ntimes that in the southern region. This gradient was determined from the measurements from the \nthree UK observatories, from Lerwick in the north of Scotland to Hartland in the south of \nEngland. \n \nThe peak magnitude of surface fields in the UK, typically increasing towards the more resistive \nnorth of the country, was over 5 V\/km, in comparison with typical quiet levels of under 0.1 \nV\/km. There is also much regional structure in the MV-SU region and strong coastal contrasts. \nOf course Figure 6 represents no more than a snapshot of possible conditions during a period of \nrapid change, both in amplitude, phase and driving frequency. It may also underestimate actual \nfield strengths and local E-field azimuths in the MV-SU region, based on the evidence of Figure \n5. It does however provide some good corroboration, in the form of GIC estimates, as is seen in \nthe next section. \n 11\n3. GIC in the UK Grid \nA transfer function (TF) method has been applied to correlate GIC data recorded at the Scottish \nPower monitoring sites shown in Figure 2 and simultaneous magnetic measurements at \nEskdalemuir observatory (based on a method described in McKay, 2004). The TF for each site \nrelates the two data sets in the frequency domain. Although the TF for each site was derived \nusing data during various storms in 2000 and 2001, it can be seen in Figure 7 that the TF method \ndoes an adequate job of reproducing the measured data during the October 2003 severe storm, \neven though changes in grid configuration in the intervening time were expected to degrade the \nmodel. Probably the most significant change in the network since the year 2000 is that STHA \nand TORN are now connected directly by a 130 km long 400 kV circuit.  Previously this \nconnection was broken down into 75 and 55 km segments rated at 275 and 400 kV respectively. \nThe previous connection therefore consisted of a 400-275 kV transformer. However, amplitudes \nare still relatively well reproduced, as is much of the time variation.  \n \nInterestingly some of the longer period signals (e.g. HUNT at around 20:15 UT) are apparently \nof the \u2018wrong\u2019 sign. This may be a consequence of the greater uncertainty in the accuracy of the \nTF coefficients at the longest periods (McKay, 2004). Where a dominant signal is found at such \nperiods, then the sign may appear reversed if it is of small amplitude, as in parts of Figure 7. (In \nthe TF model used here, periods up to about 17 minutes long are considered, though this can be \nvaried. TF models formed from longer data-vectors may improve spectral resolution at longer \nperiods but are less useful for near real time work, as in Section 5.) The Neilston (NEIL) and \nStrathaven (STHA) sites are those where most substation development work has probably been \nundertaken since 2000, but these are arguably not poorer than elsewhere. The TF-estimated data \n 12\nfor the 29th October 2003 event prove equally as accurate as those in Figure 7 and have helped \ninterpret the likely GIC variations during periods in that day when measured data were actually \nunavailable. However the estimated peak GIC do not exceed those on the 30th October, so are not \nreproduced here. \n \nA Scottish grid electrical network model, constructed following the work of Beamish et al \n(2002) and subsequently further developed by McKay (2004), has been used to estimate peak \nGIC flows during 29th-30th October 2003. This model follows the methodology of Lehtinen and \nPirjola (1985) and Viljanen and Pirjola (1994) and the relevant portion is shown in Figure 2. \nLumped resistances in the model represent the UK grid to the south in England and Wales. The \nnetwork admittance matrix for the 275kV and 400kV high voltage (HV) network is formulated \nwith reference to the Scottish Power plc \u201cSeven Year Transmission Statement\u201d. We assume \nstraight-line connections between nodes in the transmission network but use the actual line \nlength in order to calculate the power line resistance. The earthing impedance matrix for the 118 \nHV transformers in the grid at year 2000, used in this paper, incorporates the resistance of the \ntransformer windings and the earthing system of \u2018grid\u2019 or inductive transformers as well as the \nsystem of autotransformers. Transformer modelling follows M\u00e4kinen (1993), with the addition \nof virtual nodes and adjustment of the earthing and network admittance matrices, where \nnecessary. Data for these are also available from the transmission statement. For simplicity, we \nassume that each transformer is independently earthed. For example, at one particular site \n(Strathaven) there are two transformers rated at 400-275 kV and 275-33 kV. However, these \ntransformers are located in different places, and are each connected to different earth systems. \n 13\nWe assume, that the GIC in one neutral does not cause a potential shift in the other i.e. the \nimpedance matrix is diagonal. \n \nThe model may be incomplete in places. For example, as is discussed in McKay (2004), the \nneglect of the substantial (if short line-length) 132 kV network can affect the way in which \nindividual transformers are modelled.  Indeed, autotransformers can make it difficult to predict \nthe location, size and polarity of GIC in a network because different parts of the network are in \ndirect electrical contact (Koen, 2002). Therefore, we are neglecting paths along which GIC may \nflow. This is not usually considered a serious concern because, in general, transmission lines \nbecome shorter and their electric resistance increases as the system voltage decreases. However, \nMcKay (2004) illustrated, by considering the ratio of the transmission line-length to its resistance \n(to which transmission line GIC magnitude will be proportional), that neglecting the 132 kV \nnetwork may not be well justified for at least some GIC sites. For example, the mean ratio of line \nlength to resistance of all connections to the four Scottish Power monitoring sites for the 400, \n275 and 132 kV circuits is 35\uf0b19, 27\uf0b11 and 18\uf0b111 [km\/Ohm] respectively. Note that these values \nare for a single transmission line phase. In addition, the 275-132 kV auto-transformer common \nwinding resistances are smaller than that of the 400-275 kV auto-transformers. We also think \nthat the assumption of straight-line node connections may also be questionable where there is \nsignificant E-field lateral variation (e.g. as in Figures 5 and 6).    \n \nFigure 8 shows a snapshot of the grid model output just before 21:20 UT on the 30th October. \nThere is a clear east-west trend in the sign of GIC (i.e. generally, if not exclusively, \u2018in\u2019 to the \ngrid on the west coast and \u2018out\u2019 of the grid on the east coast) but with a wide variation in GIC \n 14\namplitude. It is notable from Figure 8 that there may be larger estimated GIC at other sites in the \npower grid, in comparison to the monitoring sites, and these other sites are generally close to \nboth west and east coasts.  \n \nThat differences in the peak times of measured GIC variations can be important is emphasised by \nthe GIC time series at the permanent measurement sites shown in Figure 9. We show for \ncomparison GIC model calculations. The thin-sheet model remains computationally unwieldy for \nnear real time calculation of GIC time series. Therefore we show results from model calculations \nusing a 1D geoelectric field model of the region extracted from the thin-sheet model, and \ngeomagnetic data from Eskdalemuir. Figure 9 shows the measured and model data. For example, \nat STHA the peak current is about \u201342 A just before 21:20 UT. At that time the model output is \nonly \u201320 A (see also Figure 7), although it subsequently goes below \u201340 A within one minute. In \nFigure 9 there are a number of other observations that can be made. At HUNT, the model GIC is \narguably of the \u2018wrong\u2019 sign in places and the dominant frequencies are not so well reproduced \ntoward the end of the time frame. At NEIL the measured time series is reasonably well tracked \nand peak amplitudes (if not sign) are representative of the measured data. At TORN the \nmeasured GIC are generally smoother and of lower amplitude but this is not reflected in the \nmodelled GIC. This highlights one drawback of using a 1D electric field model: each GIC \nmonitoring site has distinct amplitude and phase characteristics that reflect the driving electric \nfield sampled by each site. However, the amplitude and phase response of the modelled 1D \nelectric field, at any given frequency, is uniform throughout the region. In practice, small spatial \ndetails of the geoelectric field are unimportant, because we integrate the geoelectric field along \nthe path of transmission lines and therefore smooth local variations. However, in using a single \n 15\n1D model we neglect variations of the geoelectric field due to lateral changes in conductivity, \nwhich are of comparable scale to the length of the transmission lines. \n \nWe should note that the total estimated transformer neutral GIC at each site is given, whereas the \nmeasured GIC are taken from one single transformer. Thus, at NEIL for example, the model GIC \nare the sum of the calculated GIC in each of the three transformer neutrals included in the \nScottish Power grid model. Only the total GIC are determined because we believe that our \nelectrical model of the major sites, with complicated grounding arrangements amongst \ntransformers (of which NEIL and STHA are two such sites) is probably still incomplete.  Overall \nthere is a close similarity between the model data for the three western sites, but this is less true \nof the measured data, emphasising the significance of the detail required of the grid and\/or \nconductivity models. \n \nThe difference, in Amps, between measured GIC and GIC calculated using both the numerical \nand transfer function models is shown in Figure 10. These differences were calculated on a point \nby point basis i.e. no smoothing or averaging of the data has been carried out.  Qualitatively, we \nnote that the Transfer Function model currently performs better than the numerical model at \nthree sites (HUNT, NEIL and TORN) but at STHA the performance of both methods is almost \ncomparable. At all sites the difference between the measured GIC and GIC modelled using the \nnumerical model is rather large and in some cases approaches the size of the largest measured \nGIC. However, it is important to recognise that such a comparison does not account for any \nphase difference between the measured and modelled GIC. For example, the modelled GIC at \nSTHA lag the measured GIC by approximately 50 s. By aligning the peaks of maximum GIC we \n 16\nfind that the largest and most obvious differences can be reduced by approximately 50 %, but \nthat the overall root mean square difference between measured and modelled GIC is largely \nunaffected. In any case, the overlain plots (Figures 7 and 9) show that both methods provide an \naccurate sense of the times at which the largest GIC occur e.g. to within a minute or so of \nmeasured GIC enhancements. Further work is required in order to refine the numerical model \nand one possible strategy is to attempt to use an inverse method to go from the measured GIC \nand geomagnetic data to a conductivity model.           \n   \nFigure 11 summarises the model accuracy at various levels of confidence, obtained by a \nquantile-quantile analysis of the (model-measured) residuals during the two days of the storm. At \nthe 95% confidence level, the numerical network model analysis proves typically between 2-3 \ntimes less certain than the TF model. The exception to this is at STHA, where the uncertainties \nare similar. This could be due to a number of reasons such as a particular result of the grid \nconfiguration and higher associated confidence in the grid model and its electrical parameters at \nthat location or, STHA\u2019s relative distance from the coast. However the most likely explanation is \nthat the STHA TF is poorly resolved by the available data, i.e. the confidence intervals are wider \nthan they would be if more data had been available for its construction. Certainly the STHA TF \nestimated error is twice that typical at the other sites, thus statistical confidence in the TF \nestimate is decreased. Estimating the errors of the GIC data calculated using the numerical \nelectric field model also permits assessment of the performance of the simpler 1D model in \ncalculating GIC in both a practical and scientific sense. For example, it is interesting to note that \nfor the numerical model the estimated errors tend be larger at those sites on the edges of the \nnetwork, and close to the coast, than those located inland and within the network. This may \n 17\nindicate that the 1D assumption is less well satisfied at these sites as the coastline provides a \nmajor crustal-scale lateral conductivity contrast because sea-water is much more conductive than \nmost geological materials. Therefore, large electric field enhancements, in comparison to a 1D \nmodel, occur near the coastline (e.g. Beamish et al, 2002).      \n \n \n4. A Web Based GIC Warning and Monitoring System \nIn collaboration with Scottish Power plc and supported by an ESA grant through the \u2018Space \nWeather Pilot Project\u2019 scheme we have developed a web-based GIC monitoring and analysis tool \nfor the Scottish power grid. Figure 12 shows the front page of this password-protected tool. (A \npublic access version is under development that contains a subset of the full near real time data \nrange, for education and demonstration purposes: http:\/\/www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk\/gicpublic.) \nThere are four \u2018button\u2019 options on the front page, linking to 1) real-time geomagnetic data, in the \nform of hourly standard deviations (the HSD index described in Beamish et al, 2002), 2) the \ncurrent three day British Geological Survey geomagnetic activity forecast, 3) a list of the most \nrecent solar wind shocks and 4) estimated real time GIC flowing in the grid at all transformer \nearth points.  \n \nAll data and web pages are updated every 10 minutes. The tool is deliberately simple, with \nlimited options, primarily for clarity and ease of use. For each link (i.e. button) there is some \nbrief background information on the data being displayed as well as accuracy statistics and an \nemail contact in the event of a query, request or data error. Text versions of the main data \nstreams can also be downloaded. Each button changes to red to signify that a significant event \nhas taken place or some warning threshold has been exceeded, or blinks yellow to indicate that \n 18\nbasic data have been recently updated. Currently we use an HSD threshold of 30 nT at \nEskdalemuir (equivalent to the local minor storm threshold), an estimated GIC in excess of 3 A \n(set at a deliberately low level to indicate rising conditions), an updated forecast in the last 60 \nminutes, and a shock detected in the last 60 minutes, to switch on each of these flashing buttons. \nThe flashing stops automatically after one hour.  \nFigure 13 shows one display available through the tool. This portrays estimated GIC in the high \nvoltage grid network, as determined from the grid and electric field models. It also shows a \nsingle, higher accuracy, TF-estimated GIC time series with 95% confidence limits, for any one \nof the four permanent monitoring stations, selected by moving the mouse across the power grid \nmap.  \n \nScottish Power has routinely used the HSD index since 1999 to monitor UK geomagnetic \nvariations and to alert grid control to the onset of high geomagnetic activity and hence raised \nGIC. In the web-based system the user can browse the last week of activity at high or low time \nresolution. Geomagnetic activity forecasts are those of likely global conditions over the next \nthree days, with relevant local interpretation for the UK where possible. Individual forecasters \nmake forecasts, analysing public domain space weather data. The forecast can be backed up by \ndaytime telephone consultation and effectively provides a \u2018look ahead\u2019 service for Scottish \nPower that helps grid management and operation, particularly in the event of a forecast of high \ngeomagnetic activity.  \n \nThe shock monitor algorithm uses two simple algorithms applied to five-minute smoothed ACE \nsolar wind data: a simple threshold of the solar wind data, and the wavelet-transformed data (to \nimprove the signal to noise ratio). Currently we declare candidate shocks on a positive output \n 19\nfrom either of these methods. System tests, using the SOHO shock catalogue for 2001 (obtained \nfrom http:\/\/umtof.umd.edu\/pm\/) and the list of Mozer and Briggs (2003), demonstrate that the \nprobability of shock detection (POD) rises along with the probability of false detection (POFD). \nCurrently we have set thresholds to attain a POD of about 0.3. This provides a POFD that is \nequivalent to about one false alarm per month. In practise we judge that the shocks that are \nmissed by the system are those that are associated with less significant geomagnetic activity. In \nthe \u2018fall back\u2019 mode, used when only the total IMF is available (e.g. if the ACE \u2018SWEPAM\u2019 \ninstrument is temporarily disabled by a very high speed interplanetary coronal mass ejection), the \nPOFD rises to one false alarm per week, for a similar level of POD. \n \n5. Summary and Discussion \nThe surface electric field and GIC models both provide a reasonable fit to data though they also \nshow aspects that need to be improved, not least in the appearance of \u2018wrong sign\u2019 GIC at some \nsubstations. These differences will be investigated. The effect of more detailed ionospheric fields \n(rather than simple planar currents), and the sensitivity of the model output to transformer and \nline electrical parameters, require investigation and may prove important. It has also been shown \n(McKay, 2004) that the extensive 132 kV grid system may not be irrelevant, partly on the basis \nof estimates of the system electrical resistance, as had been previously believed. This network \nprovides many other paths for GIC to flow, and provides alternative connections across the \nhigher voltage system. The electric field model has reached a level of maturity (Beamish et al, \n1998; Beamish et al, 2002; McKay, 2004) that is difficult to take forward, without additional \nmeasurement databases for comparison, although different modelling methodologies may \nprovide other ways to construct conductance models (e.g. Wang and Lilley, 1999). A finer scale \n 20\nconductivity model might be desirable in some places, i.e. less than the 10 km grid used at \npresent, but for most practical purposes this should be sufficient. Future efforts will concentrate \non refining the grid network model. In fact, we find that the output from a simpler 1D \nconductivity model is almost as good as the 3D model output during most geomagnetic storm \nevents so far examined (e.g. the small range of E-field azimuths in Figure 6) insofar as the 1D \nmodel calculations highlight when the largest GIC occur and provide a bounded estimate of GIC \nmagnitude. Therefore the 1D modelling is considered adequate for most practical (i.e. user) \npurposes. Therefore we do not propose to develop the 3D model further at this time. However, it \nshould be remembered that in order to fully understand the amplitude and phase characteristics \nof GIC data a 3D model is essential. \n \nGIC risk to equipment in power grids may be circumvented by technical or operational means \nbut the trend to increased interconnections between national power grids, as well as the \nincreasing use of higher voltage, lower resistance systems, means that the risk cannot yet be \ndescribed as \u2018solved\u2019. Indeed pan-continental studies of GIC risk are probably becoming \nincreasingly relevant. Problems due to GIC in one country can have impact elsewhere, for \nexample in nations reliant on power imports, even by DC submarine links. In determining GIC \nrisk to power grids during times of severe geomagnetic storms, the use of models such as those \npresented in this paper will be necessary. A key requirement, as has been discussed here, will be \nthe need to properly quantify model accuracy against measured data and to continue to prompt \nthe power industry to continue such measurements. \n \n 21\nFurther improvements to the GIC web tool are planned. There is a clear user need for a \npredictive element of changes in GIC levels in power grids (e.g. Erinmez et al, 2002). \nPredictions of geomagnetic variations, for example directly from solar wind data by non-linear \nmeans (e.g. Wu and Lundstedt, 1996) are one way of adding lead-time to warnings of increasing \nGIC. The issue of the accuracy of such predictions will have to be addressed, however, and the \neffective furthest \u2018forecast horizon\u2019 will need to be determined. Otherwise it is expected that the \ntool will evolve in response to the grid operator\u2019s demands.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper would not have been possible without the data, advice and assistance of David \nMcMenemy, Tom Cumming, Tom Breckenridge and Ian Frame of Scottish Power plc.
