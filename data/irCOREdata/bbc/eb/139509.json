Fungal radial\ngrowth was measured on potato dextrose agar modified osmotically using potassium chloride or\nglycerol. PEG 8000 was used to modify matric potential. When plotted, the radii of the colonies\nwere found to grow linearly with time, and regression was applied to estimate the radial growth\nrate (mm\/day-). Samples of fresh mycelia from 25 day-old-cultures were collected and the quantity\n(mg g-1 fresh biomass) of four polyols (glycerol, erythritol, arabitol and mannitol) and one sugar\n(glucose) was determined using HPLC. Results revealed that fungal radial growth rates decreased\nwith increased osmotic or matric stress. Statistically significant differences in radial growth were\nfound between isolates in response to matric stress (p<0.006) but not in response to osmotic stress\n(p=0.759). Similarly, differences in the total amounts of polyols accumulated by the fungus were\nfound between isolates in response to matric stress (p<0.001), but not in response to osmotic stress\n(p=0.952). Under water stress, the fungus accumulated a combination of different polyols\nimportant in osmoregulation, which depended on the solute used to generate the stress. Arabitol\nand glycerol were the main polyols accumulated in osmotically modified media, whereas erythritol\nwas the main polyol that was accumulated in media amended with PEG. The results found that\nPochonia chlamydosporia may use different osmoregulation mechanisms to overcome osmotic and\nmatric stresses.\nKeywords: Biological control, water stress; Pochonia chlamydosporia; root-knot nematodes; cyst\nnematodes; endogenous reserves.\nWord count: 245\nBiocontrol Science and Technology, Volume 19, Issue 2 February 2009, pages 185-199\nDOI: 10.1080\/09583150802650175\n3\nIntroduction\nThe anamorphic and facultative parasitic fungus, Pochonia chlamydosporia (Goddard) Zare &\nGams has been associated with soils which suppress the multiplication of cyst nematode\npopulations (Kerry, Crump and Mullen, 1982). Atkins et al. (2003a) suggested the fungus has\npotential as a biological control agent against root-knot (Meloidogyne spp.) and cyst nematodes\n(Globodera spp. and Heterodera spp.) (Atkins, Clark, Kerry and Sosnowska, 2002, Tobin,\nHaydock, Hare, Woods and Crump, 2008). In order to provide effective control of nematode\nmultiplication, P. chlamydosporia must establish in the soil and rhizosphere and survive, even in\nthe absence of nematode hosts, and should infect, parasitise and consume nematode eggs when\nthey are produced on roots (Kerry and Jaffee, 1997). However, the successful development of P.\nchlamydosporia as a biocontrol agent is not only dependent on the ability of the organism to kill\nthe nematode target pest; other factors including those involved in the production of the fungus are\nimportant, as they affect the growth of the fungus in soil after its release (Kerry et al., 1993). The\nefficacy of some fungal biological control agents in soil has not been consistent because fungi can\nbe markedly influenced by environmental conditions, including the availability of water, which\naffects survival and performance (Cook and Baker, 1983). Additionally, the shelf-life of a\nformulated fungal-based biocontrol agent can be much affected by its ability to withstand drying.\nSome information is available on the water relations of P. chlamydosporia, particularly the effects\nof water stress on hyphal growth and production of chlamydospores (Kerry, Irving and Hornsey,\n1986, Bourne and Kerry, 1999, Noreen, Amer-Zareen, Zaki and Shaukat, 2001). However,\ntolerance to solute and matric stress has been little studied in this fungus. In soil and crop residues,\nmatric potential is the major component of total water potential (Magan and Lynch, 1986) and\ntherefore, matric stress is thought to have greater effect on fungal growth in soil and spore\ngermination than osmotic stress (Brownell and Schneider, 1985).\nIn order to overcome water stress, microbial cells must be able to take up water when their\ninternal water potential is less than that of the environment. The water potential gradient across the\ncell membrane results in the movement of water from the side with greater potential until, by the\ndevelopment of cell turgor, water potential inside the cell is in equilibrium with that outside (Cook\nand Baker, 1983). Osmoregulation is an energy-requiring process and may be accomplished\ninternally by the accumulation of compatible solutes. When grown under low water potentials\n(water-stress conditions), fungi are able to lower their intracellular water potential accordingly, by\nsynthesis of polyhydroxyalcohols (polyols), organic acids and sugars (Brown, 1978, Luard, 1982,\nMeikle, Chudek, Reed and Gadd, 1991, Van Eck, Prior and Brandt, 1993, Hallsworth and Magan,\n1994a, Hallsworth and Magan, 1994b). These solutes are accumulated in protoplasmic and\nvacuolar spaces in fungal propagules (Brown and Simpson, 1972), and regulate the intracellular\nBiocontrol Science and Technology, Volume 19, Issue 2 February 2009, pages 185-199\nDOI: 10.1080\/09583150802650175\n4\nosmotic potential (Pascual, Melgarejo and Magan, 2000). By altering the conditions of growth,\nsuch as reducing the availability of water in the medium, fungi are seen to change the quantity\nand\/or proportion of the endogenous reserves accumulated (Ramos, Magan and Sanchis, 1999),\nwhich may improve spore germination rate (Hallsworth and Magan, 1995) and change the\nvirulence of certain species (Chandler, Andersen and Magan, 2005). Therefore, effective\nphysiological manipulation of inocula may improve spore quality and the establishment of the\nfungus in soil, thus leading to improved efficacy of fungal-based biocontrol agents (Magan, 2001).\nThe objectives of this study were to: (a) quantify the effect of varying levels of solute (ionic, non-\nionic water stress) and matric stress on the radial growth of P. chlamydosporia and (b) measure the\naccumulation of endogenous low and high molecular weight polyols (glycerol, erythritol, arabitol\nand mannitol) and a sugar (glucose) in response to osmotic and matric water stress, in three isolates\nof the fungus.\nMaterials and methods\nFungal isolates\nThe identity of three isolates (10, 280 and 392) of P. chlamydosporia was checked using specific\ndiagnostic primers derived from the \u00df-tubulin gene, and confirmed to be P. chlamydosporia using\nPCR (Hirsch, Mauchline, Mendum and Kerry, 2000). DNA fingerprinting enabled the\ndiscrimination between different isolates of P. chlamydosporia grown in pure culture (Arora,\nHirsch and Kerry, 1996). The isolate 392, originally isolated from Cuba, was identified as P.\nchlamydosporia var. catenulata, and could also be distinguished from isolates of P.\nchlamydosporia var. chlamydosporia using specific PCR primers (Atkins et al., 2003b). The three\nfungal isolates are maintained as freeze-dried samples in a collection at Rothamsted Research, UK.\nMedia\nThe medium used in this study was potato dextrose agar (PDA), prepared according to the\ninstructions of the manufacturer (Oxoid). The osmotic potential of the PDA (-0.7 Mpa) was\nmodified to -1.4, -2.8 and -7.1 MPa (Magan, 1997) by the addition of the ionic solute, potassium\nchloride (KCl) or the non-ionic solute, glycerol (Dallyn and Fox, 1980).\nFor modification of the matric potential, PDA was omitted and known amounts of PEG\n8000 were used, resulting in matric potentials of -1.4, -2.8 and -4.2 MPa. The water potential\ngenerated by PEG 8000 is mainly (99%) due to matric forces (Steuter, Mozafar and Goodin, 1981).\nThe medium was enriched with peptone (10 g l-1) and glucose (40 g l-1) and was autoclaved prior to\nuse. Sterile disks of capillary matting (8.5 cm diameter) were placed in sterile 9 cm Petri dishes to\nwhich 20 ml of the room temperature cooled medium was added. The matting was overlaid with a\nBiocontrol Science and Technology, Volume 19, Issue 2 February 2009, pages 185-199\nDOI: 10.1080\/09583150802650175\n5\nsterile disk of black polyester lining cloth and then a cellophane disk (Ramos et al., 1999), to\nprovide support for fungal growth in the liquid medium.\nInoculation and measurement\nPetri dishes were inoculated centrally with a 5 mm diameter agar plug taken from the edge of\nseven-day-old colonies growing on PDA (Ramos et al., 1999). Using a completely randomised\ndesign, five dishes per treatment combination (solute \u00d7 water potential) were inoculated and\nincubated at 25\u00b0C; those at the same water potential were placed in sealed polyethylene bags\n(Mar\u00edn, Sanchis and Magan, 1995). The growing colonies were measured along two diameters at\nright angles after 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 18 and 25 days, which was prior to any colony reaching the edge\nof its dish. Additionally, the numbers of spores (chlamydospores) produced after 25 days of growth\nin osmotically modified media were recorded in all isolates, at each level of water potential.\nQuantification of polyols and glucose\nA sample of 100 mg of fresh, aerial mycelia from each of three randomly selected replicate dishes\nof each treatment combination of the 25 day-old-cultures was mixed with 1 ml of HPLC grade\nwater in a 2 ml microtube (Eppendorf) and sonicated for two minutes using a Soniprep 150 (Fisher\nScientific UK), at 28 \u00b5m amplitude. After immersion in a boiling water bath for 5.5 minutes, the\nsamples were left to cool (Hallsworth and Magan, 1994a) and 667 \u00b5l of acetonitrile were added to\nmaintain a 40:60 acetonitrile:water ratio, the same ratio as in the mobile phase of the HPLC. The\ntubes were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1150\u00d7 g (Microfuge). The supernatant was filtered\nthrough 0.2 \u00b5m aperture membrane filters (13 mm diameter, Whatman) and injected into a Gilson\nHPLC for quantification of solutes. The HPLC was fitted with a Hamilton HC-75 Ca 2+ column,\nand a refraction index detector. The mobile phase was 40:60 acetonitrile:water and the flow rate\nwas 1 ml min-1. The solutes of particular interest from this analysis were four polyols (glycerol,\nerythritol, arabitol and mannitol) and one sugar (glucose). Solute quantification was measured\nusing the Gilson software adapted to the HPLC equipment. Peak areas were integrated by the\nsoftware and amounts expressed as mg g-1 fresh biomass based on the calibration curves and the\npure sugar alcohols or glucose.\nStatistical analysis\nEffects of osmotic and matric potential on the radial growth rate in three isolates of P.\nchlamydosporia\nA two-stage modelling approach was used for analysis of fungal radial growth (Mead, Curnow and\nHasted, 2003). Firstly, the radii of the colonies were plotted against time for each replicate dish and\nBiocontrol Science and Technology, Volume 19, Issue 2 February 2009, pages 185-199\nDOI: 10.1080\/09583150802650175\n6\nwere found to increase linearly. Linear regression was applied to estimate the radial growth rate\n(mm\/day) for each colony. As the second stage of the analysis, the radial growth rates were\nmodelled on the different water potentials for osmotic and matric stress, in separate analyses for\neach type of stress.\nModification of osmotic potential\nA parallel curve regression and exponential model was used to describe the radial growth rates for\nosmotic stress. The form of this model was\nY= a + b exp (c (MPa + 0.7))\nwhere Y represents the estimated radial growth rates, a + b represents the radial growth rate in the\ncontrol condition (MPa = -0.7) and c is the rate of exponential decay in the radial growth rate with\ndecreasing MPa. The statistical significance of differences between the two types of solute used\n(KCl or glycerol) and the three isolates were then assessed in terms of whether separate values for\nthe a, b or c parameters were required in the model for the categories of these different factors.\nModification of the matric potential\nA parallel lines regression was applied to describe the radial growth rates for matric stress. A\nlinear model and analysis was used to determine whether separate intercept or slope parameters\nwere required for the three isolates.\nThe estimated MPa for zero radial growth was also estimated using the fitted regression curves or\nlines.\nThe radial growth rates at each level of matric or osmotic potential were compared separately by\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA). The data were checked for Normality and constant variance by\nplotting histograms of residuals and plotting the residuals against the fitted values. No\ntransformation was required. Following ANOVA, least significant differences (LSD) were used to\nstatistically separate the means, at the 5% level of significance. The Genstat\u00ae (2007) statistical\nsystem was used for all analyses.\nEffects of osmotic and matric potential on the accumulation of endogenous reserves in three\nisolates of P. chlamydosporia\nModification of osmotic potential\nFor polyol data from HPLC, ANOVA was applied to assess the significance of differences between\nisolates, media and variation in the osmotic potential. Due to two of the isolates (isolate 10 and\n392) having no observations for erythritol and total polyols for the treatment using glycerol, at -2.8\nMPa, the method of Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) was applied (Patterson and\nThompson, 1971) as implemented in GenStat (2007). This method takes account of the unbalance,\nBiocontrol Science and Technology, Volume 19, Issue 2 February 2009, pages 185-199\nDOI: 10.1080\/09583150802650175\n7\nwhile still providing an assessment of treatment effects via approximate F-tests, standard errors of\ndifference (SED) between means and LSD (5%).\nModification of matric potential\nSimilar analysis was applied to data from the experiment investigating the effect of matric potential\nin the accumulation of endogenous reserves. In this case, there were no observations for glycerol,\nat -2.8 MPa, therefore, REML was used. As the polyol data showed a clear skewed distribution,\ndata were transformed to the natural logarithm scale.\nResults\nEffects of osmotic and matric potential on the radial growth rates in three isolates of P.\nchlamydosporia\nModification of osmotic potential\nThe mean radial growth of colonies for each of the three fungal isolates, in response to osmotic\nstress was found to be linear over time (Figure 1). At -7.1 MPa, none of the P. chlamydosporia\nisolates tested grew in the medium modified with glycerol, but continued growing at this water\npotential in the medium modified with KCl (Figure 1). Having applied the linear regression model\nto each replicate, the average of the estimated rates of radial growth of P. chlamydosporia, for each\ncombination of solute, isolate and water potential level was calculated (Figure 2). The exponential\nmodel revealed significant differences between the solutes KCl and glycerol (p<0.001), but no\ndifferences (p>0.05) were found in the rates of decrease for the three isolates (Figure 2). The model\nshows that the exponential rate of decrease in radial growth using KCl (0.115) was approximately\nhalf of the rate of decrease using glycerol (0.228). Analysis of Variance of the estimated radial\ngrowth rates at different osmotic potentials showed a three-way interaction between solute, isolate\nand MPa level (p<0.001); although the overall main effect of isolate was not significant (p=0.759),\nwhich supports the result found using the exponential model.\nModification of matric potential\nWhen PEG 8000 was added to the medium for modification of the matric potential, the\nvariation in the radial growth rates with decreasing MPa was linear (p<0.001), and separate lines\nfor isolates were fitted (Figure 3). The Analysis of Variance of radial growth rates for matric\npotential gave a significant interaction between isolate and MPa level (p<0.001), with both main\neffects also being significant (p<0.006).\nGiven the models, the limits of radial growth potential were estimated (Table 1). The\nfungus was generally more tolerant to the ionic solute KCl than to glycerol. In matrically modified\nmedia, the limits for growth differed from -5.16 \u00b1 0.19 to -6.38 \u00b1 0.39 MPa, depending on the\nBiocontrol Science and Technology, Volume 19, Issue 2 February 2009, pages 185-199\nDOI: 10.1080\/09583150802650175\n8\nisolate (Table 1). Chlamydospores were produced by all isolates in the unmodified medium but few\nor none were produced at lower osmotic potentials (Table 2).\nEffects of osmotic and matric potential on the accumulation of endogenous reserves in three\nisolates of P. chlamydosporia\nModification of osmotic potential\nThe total amounts of polyols accumulated intracellularly were greater and significantly different in\nosmotically modified media (p<0.05, using LSD), when compared with those endogenous reserves\naccumulated in unmodified media, with the exception of media modified with KCl at -1.4 MPa\n(Table 3-A). However, no significant differences in the amounts of total polyols were found\nbetween isolates in response to modification of the osmotic potential (p=0.952).\nThe proportion of polyols accumulated by the fungus depended on the solute used to\ngenerate the water stress (Figure 4). When grown in media osmotically modified with glycerol, the\nfungus accumulated proportionately greater amounts of glycerol compared to the other polyols and\nin the control medium (Figure 4). In media osmotically modified with KCl, the accumulation of\narabitol at -1.4 and -2.8 MPa was proportionately greater than in unmodified media (Figure 4). In\nthe media modified with glycerol, greater amounts of glucose were detected, compared with the\namounts accumulated in colonies growing in media where water was freely available (Table 3-A).\nHowever, fungal growth in media modified with KCl did not result in a significant change in the\naccumulation of glucose (p>0.05) (Table 3-A). There was a highly significant interaction (p<0.001)\nbetween isolates, media and level of water potential in the accumulation of arabitol and mannitol.\nComparing specific quantities (on the natural logarithm scale), there was a greater (p <0.05)\naccumulation of arabitol at -2.8 and and -7.1 MPa, in all isolates compared to the control (Table 4-\nA). However, no significant differences (p>0.05) between isolates were found in the accumulation\nof glycerol and erythritol (Table 4-A).Modification of matric potential\nThe quantity of polyols accumulated by the fungus in media modified with PEG was greater and\nsignificantly different (p<0.05) compared to that accumulated in unmodified media, in all the\nisolates tested (Table 3-B). Significant differences in the amounts of total polyols were found\nbetween isolates in response to matric stress levels (p<0.001). However, the three-way interaction\nbetween isolates, matric stress levels and solute was not significant (p=0.247). The total amounts of\npolyols accumulated were greatest when the fungus grew at water potentials of -4.2 MPa, in media\namended with PEG (Table 3-B). In matrically modified media, a large quantity of erythritol was\naccumulated in all the isolates, and this increased substantially with the reduction of the water\npotential (Figure 4-B). There was a significant interaction (p<0.001) between isolates and level of\nwater potential in all types of polyols (Table 4-B).\nBiocontrol Science and Technology, Volume 19, Issue 2 February 2009, pages 185-199\nDOI: 10.1080\/09583150802650175\n9\nDiscussion\nFor the first time, the effects of osmotic and matric potential on radial growth and\naccumulation of polyols were studied in colonies from different isolates of P. chlamydosporia. In\nthis study, the fungus grew faster in a non-modified medium, when water was freely available (-0.7\nMPa). Similar results were found by Kerry et al.(1986), who studied the effects of pH and water\npotential on the growth of six isolates of the fungus on a basal medium amended with a mixture of\nsalts or with sucrose. However, matric stress, a component of the water potential relevant to growth\nand colonisation in soil (Brownell and Schneider, 1985), was not considered in their study. In the\npresent study, radial growth rates decreased substantially with the increase of osmotic or matric\nstress. Although radial growth rates were lower in PEG-modified media, the fungus was relatively\ntolerant to matric stress. Interestingly, differences between isolates were found in response to\nmatric stress on the PEG-modified media but isolates responded similarly on the medium modified\nwith the ionic and non ionic solute, used to subject the fungal isolates to osmotic stress. Tolerance\nto matric stress may have been related to the accumulation of high amounts of erythritol in PEG-\nmodified media, which enables enzyme systems to work effectively in such conditions. Low-\nmolecular weight erythritol is known to regulate intracellular water potential efficiently, and is\naccumulated by xerophylic fungi in response to water stress (Hallsworth, 1995).\nAll the isolates tended to be more sensitive to the non-ionic solute glycerol than to the ionic\nKCl. At -7.1 MPa, the fungus was able to continue growing in a medium amended with the ionic\nsolute, but not in a medium amended with glycerol at this level of MPa. Low concentrations of\nionic solutes, such as KCl, may stimulate growth in some fungi (Larsen, 1986), as K ions aid\ntransport across the mycelial cell walls to enable better intracellular osmotic adjustment. Therefore,\nit is possible that KCl from the medium may have been utilised to provide increased tolerance to\nosmotic stress.\nIn media modified with glycerol, P. chlamydosporia accumulated large amounts of\nglycerol, which were much greater than in unmodified media. This accumulation was possibly a\nresponse to regulate intracellular osmotic potential. As glycerol was used to modify the medium, it\nmay have been passively accumulated by the fungus which in turn helped it to tolerate the increase\nin stress. Glycerol appears to be of crucial importance in many fungi, as it protects enzymes from\naccumulation of sodium and from loss of water, both of which may denature the enzymes (Luard,\n1982).\nThe quantities of the major sugar alcohol accumulated in colonies of P. chlamydosporia\ndepended on the solute used to generate the water stress. Whereas arabitol and glycerol were the\nBiocontrol Science and Technology, Volume 19, Issue 2 February 2009, pages 185-199\nDOI: 10.1080\/09583150802650175\n10\nmain polyols accumulated in osmotically modified media with ionic and non-ionic solutes,\nrespectively, erythritol was the main sugar accumulated in media amended with PEG.. The\nversatility to accumulate different polyols and perhaps different sugars under different stress\nconditions might bring advantage of allowing the fungus to survive in soil when environmental\nconditions are less favourable or highly variable. In some fungi, enhanced accumulation of\ncompatible solutes contributed to an improvement in viability (Hallsworth and Magan, 1995,\nMokiou, 2005, Teixid\u00f3 et al., 2005) and even virulence (Chandler et al., 2005). Therefore, the\nviability of the spores produced under different stress regimes might have been different, although\nthis aspect was not covered in the study, as few chlamydospores were produced on osmotically\nmodified media, after 25 days of growth (Table 2). As chlamydospores are the preferred type of\ninoculum to establish the fungus in soil (De Leij and Kerry, 1991) it was considered that any\nimprovement through the incorporation of polyols could be greatly outweighed by the reduction in\nchlamydospore production. To conclude, the presence of free water available in the agar media\nfavoured the growth of P. chlamydosporia, when compared to growth rates in media where water\nwas restricted. Fungal growth was affected by both osmotic and matric stress, although this species\ncan tolerate matric stress levels relevant to those that occur in soil. Under water stress, the fungus\naccumulated a combination of different sugar alcohols important in osmoregulation, the differential\nand proportional amounts of which were dependent on the solute used. The research presented in\nthis paper provides some new information suggesting the involvement of different mechanisms of\nosmoregulation in P. chlamydosporia as a response to osmotic and matric stress on mycelial\ngrowth and the accumulation of endogenous reserves in spores. Further research is needed to study\nthe effects of such changes on fungal survival and activity in soil.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful for the financial support received from the EU for the project, ICA4-CT-\n2002-10044, MiCoSPA - Microbial Pest Control for Sustainable Peri-urban\/ urban Agriculture in\nLatin America (Cuba and Mexico).
