INTRODUCTION\nDue to the Borromean structure of 9Be the breakup of this\nnucleus can, in principle, occur directly to two \u03b1 particles\nand a neutron or via one of two unstable intermediate nuclei:\n8Be and 5He. These two nuclei have lifetimes of 10\u221216 and\n10\u221221 s, respectively, and have broad resonance states such as\nthe first excited state in 8Be at 3.04 MeV (\u0002 \u0003 1.5 MeV) and\nthe 5Heg.s. (\u0002 \u0003 0.6 MeV).\nFigure 1 illustrates the states in 9Be up to Ex = 11 MeV as\nderived from proton-scattering measurements made by Dixit\net al. [1]. Previous measurements of the breakup of 9Be have\nmostly been concerned with breakup via those states below\nEx = 12 MeV [2\u20138]. Given the available excitation energy,\nfour channels can be identified as the principal breakup paths:\n9Be\u2217 \u2192 8Beg.s + n \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n (1)\n9Be\u2217 \u2192 8Be2+ + n \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n (2)\n9Be\u2217 \u2192 5Heg.s. + \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1 + n + \u03b1 (3)\n9Be\u2217 \u2192 \u03b1 + \u03b1 + n. (4)\nThe breakup of 9Be via the 8Beg.s has been quantified for\nmany of the low-lying excited states in 9Be [4,5]. However,\nthe amount of the breakup yield going via the 8Be2+ state and\nthe 5Heg.s. remains uncertain. There is experimental evidence\nthat suggests that a considerable amount of yield will go via\n*Present address: CENPA, Box 354290, University of Washington,\nSeattle, WA 98195, U.S.A.\n\u2020Present address: iThemba LABS, P.O. Box 722, Somerset West\n7129 , South Africa.\none of these two breakup channels for the states just above\nbreakup threshold (those below Ex = 4.0 MeV), although it\nhas not been possible to distinguish between the kinematics\nof these two channels [8\u201310]. There has also been evidence of\nbreakup via the 5Heg.s. for the higher states in 9Be although\nlittle quantitative information has been provided [9,11,12]. The\ncontribution of the direct breakup channel has largely been\nignored. However, due to the large width of the first excited\nstate in 8Be (\u0002 \u0003 1.5 MeV), breakup via the 8Be2+ state has\nbeen considered a variant of direct breakup in the past [2].\nThe breakup of a nucleus into particular channels is\ncorrelated with the strength of the cluster configurations in the\nwave function for each state. There have been many theoretical\nmodels used to describe clustering in the 9Be nucleus,\nincluding AMD models, which illustrate a cluster substructure\nin the model wave functions [13]. Recent fully microscopic\ncluster model calculations have also been carried out assuming\nn + 8Beg.s, n + 8Be2+ , and \u03b1+ 5He configurations [14,15].\nThese suggest that the latter components become dominant for\nhigher excitation energies. However, it should be noted that the\nobserved branching ratios for the different reaction channels\nwill generally be governed by the presence of Coulomb and\ncentrifugal barriers. Neither of these considerations favor\nbreakup via \u03b1+ 5He for those states in 9Be just above breakup\nthreshold.\nThe inverse of 9Be breakup, the three-body formation (\u03b1\u03b1n)\nof 9Be, may have significant astrophysical repercussions. The\nreaction is believed to be one of the key reactions that bridges\nthe mass number gap at A = 5 and A = 8 in the neutron\nand \u03b1-particle-rich environment produced by a core collapse\nsupernova explosion [16,17].

The low-lying excited states in 9Be derived from proton-\nscattering measurements made by Dixit et al. [1]. The states at 2.429\nand 6.380 MeV are part of the ground-state rotational band.\nof this reaction, including the most recent [7,18], have assumed\nthe \u03b1\u03b1n reaction proceeds entirely through the 8Beg.s. for the\nastrophysically relevant states in 9Be below 4 MeV. The short\nlifetimes of the 8Be2+ state and the 5Heg.s. suggest that the\nsequential capture of a neutron or an \u03b1 particle is very unlikely.\nThe formalism used to derive the \u03b1\u03b1n rate by Grigorenko\nand Zhukov [19] also suggests that any broad intermediate\nresonances will have little effect on the \u03b1\u03b1n rate. However,\nanother recent theoretical calculation of the \u03b1\u03b1n rate has\nsuggested that at temperatures above 3 \u00d7 109 K the 5Heg.s.\nchannel becomes significant for the formation of 9Be [20]. This\nresult, along with the qualitative breakup data discussed above,\nsuggests the necessity of acquiring quantitative branching ratio\ndata for the low-lying states in 9Be.\nThis article presents the results of an experiment designed to\nstudy the breakup of 9Be and provide a quantitative description\nof the channel branching ratios for the low-lying states.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe experiment was performed using the 14UD pelletron\ntandem accelerator at the Australian National University\nduring April 2003. The experiment was designed to study\nthe inelastic scattering of 6Li nuclei from a 9Be target and the\nsubsequent breakup of the excited 9Be nuclei. The detection\ntechnique for this experiment required that the 6Li recoils\nwere detected and identified. By also detecting and identifying\nthe two corresponding \u03b1 particles for each breakup event,\nit is possible to reconstruct the missing momentum of the\nundetected neutron. The reaction kinematics are then fully\ndefined, allowing the complete reconstruction of the breakup\nevents and identification of the states in 9Be that were\npopulated.\nA 6Li beam at Elab = 60 MeV was focused onto a 9Be\ntarget (256 \u00b5g\/cm2). Data were taken for approximately\n92 h with a beam current of between Ibeam = 2 and 5 enA. For\nthe purposes of detecting the \u03b1 particles arising from breakup,\nfour position-sensitive silicon strip detectors (PSSSDs) were\n9\n(5 x 5 cm)\n(5 x 5 cm)\n\u03b160o\n30 34\n62\nBe Target  \n(256 2g\/cm\u00b5\n6\n)\nTarget \u2212 Detector \nView along beam axis\n  10 cmDistance ~\no\n\u03b1\n6\nLi beam\no\nLi recoil\nSilicon Quadrant Detector\nPSSSD \no\n@ 60 MeV\nFIG. 2.

Each detector has a thickness of l \u0003 500 \u00b5m and is\ncomposed of sixteen 50-mm-long resistive strips 3 mm wide.\nThe PSSSDs typically have an energy resolution of \u03b4E \u0003\n0.2 MeV and a position uncertainty of \u0004x \u0003 \u00b10.5 mm along\na strip. As shown in Fig. 2, a pair of detector telescopes were\nused to detect and identify recoil 6Li nuclei. Each consisted of\nof a silicon quadrant detector (l \u0003 65\u00b5m) mounted in front of\na PSSSD. The position of the detectors relative to the target\nare indicated in Fig. 2 and were chosen based on efficiency\nresults obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.\nIII. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nA. SIMSORT\nFor the purposes of gaining a better interpretation of the\nexperimental results, a Monte Carlo program, SIMSORT [21],\nwas written to simulate the breakup reaction and the detector\nresponse. SIMSORT permits the user to define the exact nature\nof the breakup: the excited state populated in 9Be and whether\nbreakup occurs via the 8Beg.s, the 8Be2+ state, or the 5Heg.s..\nThe code contains the details of the different excited states\nin 9Be up to Ex = 11.28 MeV. An anisotropic distribution,\ndetermined from the spin of the initial and final states, is\nused for each of the breakup stages [22]. The scattering\ndistribution used for the 6Li recoils was derived from the\nexperimental results (\u03b8 was reconstructed using the strip\nposition information from the PSSSDs in the two telescopes).\nIn addition to the physics governing the breakup, the energy\nloss and straggling in the target is also included along with\ndetails of the detector setup, i.e., threshold detection energies,\nthe expected energy and position resolution for the PSSSDs,\net cetera. For the sake of consistency with the analysis of the\nreal data, SIMSORT uses an identical data sort process.\nB. 8Beg.s events\nFigure 3 illustrates an E-\u0004E spectrum plotted from data\ntaken from both detector telescopes. Three principle loci can\nbe easily identified on the spectrum: one corresponding to\nscattered 9Be, another corresponding to scattered 6Li, and a\n054605-2\nDECAY STUDIES FOR STATES IN 9Be UP TO 11 . . .

There is also evidence of loci\ncorresponding to protons and deuterons at low energy.\nThe spectrum in Fig. 4 shows the relative energy for two\nparticles detected in coincidence with the 6Li nuclei identified\nin Fig. 3. The relative energy has been reconstructed assuming\nthe two detected particles were \u03b1 particles and by imposing a\ntotal energy gate consistent with 9Be breakup. Events where\ntwo particles hit adjacent strips were rejected, because it is\npossible for a particle hitting the narrow gap between two\nstrips to induce charge on both strips.\nThree principle features can be identified from the spectrum\nin Fig. 4. A peak with an Erel \u0003 0.092 MeV (Q value of 8Be\nbreakup) can be observed, corresponding to events that break\nup via the 8Beg.s.. A broad peak at Erel \u0003 2.8 MeV can also be\nidentified. This corresponds to the energy of the first excited\nstate (2+) in 8Be and identifies events that breakup via this\nstate. However, the large relative energy between the two \u03b1\nparticles suggests that the events could also correspond to\nbreakup via 5He. The third feature in the spectrum, the peak\nlying at Erel \u0003 0.6 MeV, does not correspond to an energy state\nin 8Be. In the past, events in this peak have been attributed to\neither breakup via the tail of the broad 2+ state in 8Be (\u0002 \u0003\n1.5 MeV) or breakup via the 5Heg.s. [8,10]. Ashwood et al. [10]\nwere able to reproduce this feature using a decay phase-space\ncalculation for both breakup via the 8Be2+ state and breakup\nvia the 5Heg.s..\n Relative Energy (MeV)\u03b1-\u03b1\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nN\no.\n o\nf E\nve\nnt\ns\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\nFIG. 4. \u03b1-\u03b1 relative energy spectrum for events with 57 MeV\n< ETOT < 60 MeV.\nTotal Energy (MeV)\n56 58 60 62\nN\no \n.o\nf E\nve\nnt\ns\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n58.4 MeV\nFIG. 5.

Both spectra have been corrected for energy\nloss in the target Eloss \u223c 0.1 MeV. Given the beam energy\n(Elab = 60 MeV) and the Q value of the breakup of 9Be\n(Q = \u22121.57 MeV), the total energy of genuine 9Be breakup\nevents should be reconstructed around ETOT \u0003 58.4 MeV.\nThis is demonstrated in Fig. 5. The \u03b1 particles detected at\nlow energy and large angles, arising from the energy loss and\nstraggling in the target, make the dominant contribution toward\nthe experimental resolution.\nFigure 6 shows a 9Be excitation energy spectrum re-\nconstructed for the 8Beg.s. events identified in Fig. 4. A\nbest fit of the state line shapes to the spectrum suggests\nstrong contributions from the states at Ex = 2.43, 3.05, and\n4.70 MeV.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 054605 (2007)\nby the energy of the known states between Ex = 1 and\n6 MeV, and the peak widths were constrained by the state\nintrinsic widths and the experimental resolution (obtained from\nFig. 9). To remove the effect on the experimental resolution\nfrom low-energy \u03b1 particles, the excitation energy was derived\nfrom the detected 6Li recoil energy and angle. However, the\nbroad width (\u0002 = 0.632 MeV) assigned to the narrow state at\nEx = 2.43 MeV indicates that the experimental resolution is\nstill poor. The dominant factors in this case are 6Li energy loss\nand straggling in the target and the silicon quadrant detectors.\nThe experimental spectrum in Fig. 5 suggests that there\nmay also be a background component to the 9Be excitation\nenergy spectrum. By gating on ETOT values away from the peak\nregion, it can be shown that such a component is approximately\nflat and small relative to the number of events in Fig. 6. If a\nlinear background component is introduced into the fitting\nroutine it has little effect on the position and width of the\npeaks.\nThe discrepancies between the fitted profile and the\nmeasured spectrum arise from the fact that, although the\nproton-scattering measurements of Dixit et al. [1] simply\nprobe the excitation of the states, the data in this measurment\nreflect both the state population and the subsequent selection\nof one of the possible decay modes. Because the Coulomb\nand centrifugal barriers differ for each decay channel and,\nmoreover, are energy dependent, imposing a decay channel\nselection will affect the shape as well as the apparent position\nof the peak resulting from a given state.\nC. Neutron transfer events\nEvents corresponding to the neutron transfer reaction\n9Be(6Li, 7Li\u2217)8Be\u2217 \u2212\u2192 6Li + 2\u03b1 + n (6)\nwere rejected in the data sort process. This reaction has an\nidentical Q value to 9Be breakup and it was thought that\nit may be contaminating the breakup events of interest. The\nneutron transfer events were identified by reconstructing the\nexcitation energy of the parent 7Li nucleus. This is plotted\nin Fig. 7, and shows there is strong population of the fourth\nexcited state in 7Li (5\/2\u2212) at 7.5 MeV, the first state above\nthe neutron emission threshold at 7.2 MeV. The events that\nfall into this peak have been rejected when reconstructing 9Be\nevents. However, these contaminating events constitute only\napproximately 10% of the data and have little effect on the\nshape and the features of the spectra.\nD. Breakup events with a large \u03b1-\u03b1 relative energy\nFigure 8 shows the 9Be excitation energy spectrum for\nevents identified in Fig. 4 with an \u03b1-\u03b1Erel > 0.2 MeV. This\nspectrum illustrates the population of states possibly as high\nas Ex = 11 MeV, although it is difficult to resolve individual\nstates. As before, by deconvoluting the narrow peak just above\nEx = 2 MeV and the broad peak centered at Ex \u0003 6.5 MeV,\nit is possible to identify the contributing states.\nFigure 9 shows the 9Be excitation energy spectrum for\nevents residing in (a) the peak with \u03b1-\u03b1Erel \u0003 0.6 MeV and (b)\nLi Excitation Energy (MeV)7\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\nN\no.\n o\nf E\nve\nnt\ns\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nFIG. 7. 7Li excitation energy specrum for 8Beg.s. events with\n57 MeV < ETOT < 60 MeV.\nthe peak with \u03b1-\u03b1Erel \u0003 2.8 MeV. It can be seen from Fig. 9(a)\nthat these events break up mostly via the state at Ex = 2.43\nMeV. The line shapes fitted to the spectrum indicate there\nis also a contribution from the state at Ex = 3.05 MeV. The\nwidths for the line shapes obtained in this fit were used to fix\nthe width of the line shapes used in Fig. 6. The spectrum in\nFig. 9(b) indicates that these events populate only those states\nin 9Be above Ex = 4.0 MeV. Strong contributions can be seen\nfrom the states at Ex = 6.38 and 6.76 MeV. Lorentzian line\nshapes have been used to fit the spectrum for all these broad\n(\u0002 > 1.0 MeV) states.\nThe quality of the fit to the spectrum in Fig. 9(b) is again\naffected by the distortion of the states associated with feeding\nto the 8Be2+ state\/5Heg.s., but also possibly by the presence of\nother states in the 4- to 12-MeV region [23].\nThe issue of whether these events break up via the\n5Heg.s. or the 8Be2+ state was resolved by analyzing the\n\u03b1-n relative energy. The detected breakup \u03b1 particles were\nrandomly labeled \u03b11 and \u03b12 in the data sort process. Figure 10\nillustrates a series of spectra where the \u03b11-n relative energy\nhas been plotted against the \u03b12-n relative energy.

Breakup path for the other states below Ex = 4.0 MeV\nFor the energy region around the states at Ex = 2.78 and\n3.05 MeV, there are very few breakup events associated with\neither of these states. The poor statistics means that it is very\ndifficult to use any of the previous methods to distinguish\nthe 8Be2+ and 5Heg.s. breakup channels.

Results\nTable I lists the estimated branching ratio and corresponding\ndetection efficiency for states in 9Be up to Ex = 11.28 MeV.\nFor the states above Ex = 2.43 MeV, the events have been\nselected by gating on energy regions of 0.2 MeV approxi-\nmately centered on each state. To overcome the problem of\npoor statistics around the state at Ex = 11.28 MeV, an energy\nwindow of 0.4 MeV was used for this case. A branching ratio\nvalue has not been estimated for the state at 5.59 MeV. This\nstate\u2019s event contribution is very small, and the number of\nevents in the energy region around this state are dominated by\nthe adjacent states. Given the large amount of overlap between\nthe states at Ex = 6.38 and 6.76 MeV, a combined branching\nratio has been quoted for both of these states.\nThe detection efficiencies have been determined using\nSIMSORT for the angular range covered by the detectors. The\nabsolute efficiency values given in Table I were determined\nusing isotropic center-of-mass breakup distributions. Although\nthese values are different if an anisotropy is used, their\nvalue relative to one another for a given breakup path\n(which ultimately determines the branching ratio) is relatively\ninsensitive to this change.\nTABLE I.\n9Be state\/\u0004Ex BCa \u0006(%)b BR (%)c\n1.684 MeV 8Beg.s. 0.5 100\n8Be2+ 2.8 0\n2.429 MeV 8Beg.s. 3.5 6 \u00b1 1\n8Be2+ 2.5 94 \u00b1 2\n5Heg.s. 2.7 <5\n2.780 MeVd 8Beg.s. 3.4 32 \u00b1 15\n(2.7\u20132.9) 8Be2+ 2.5 < 69\n5Heg.s. 2.7 < 67\n3.049 MeVd 8Beg.s. 3.4 46 \u00b1 20\n(2.95\u20133.15) 8Be2+ 2.5 < 55\n5Heg.s. 2.6 < 54\n4.704 MeV 8Beg.s. 3.3 16 \u00b1 2\n(4.6\u20134.8) 8Be2+ 1.8 43 \u00b1 20\n5Heg.s. 1.9 41 \u00b1 20\n6.380 \/ 6.760\nMeV\n8Beg.s. 3.2 4 \u00b1 1\n(6.3\u20136.85) 8Be2+ 1.5 7 \u00b1 3\n5Heg.s. 1.1 89 \u00b1 35\n11.280 MeV 8Beg.s. 3.2 3 \u00b1 1\n(11.1\u201311.5) 8Be2+ 1.1 21 \u00b1 8\n5Heg.s. 0.2 76 \u00b1 30\naBreakup channel.\nbDetection efficiency.\ncBranching ratio corrected for detection efficiency.\ndMost events associated with the 2.43-MeV state have been removed.\n054605-6\nDECAY STUDIES FOR STATES IN 9Be UP TO 11 . . .

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nGenuine 9Be breakup events have been identified and\nexcitation energy spectra have been reconstructed illustrating\nthe population of low-lying states in 9Be. The branching ratio\nof each breakup path has been estimated for states in 9Be up\nto Ex = 11.28 MeV.\nThe branching ratios calculated for Ex > 4.0 MeV have\nconfirmed that the 5Heg.s. breakup channel plays a significant\nrole as we move to higher energy and confirms the observations\nof breakup via 5Heg.s. made by Prezado [9], Soic\u00b4 [12], and\nNyman [11]. The values given for feeding to the 8Beg.s. are\nbroadly consistent with the values determined by Cocke and\nChristensen [5]. The large 5Heg.s. branching ratio for the energy\nregion corresponding to the states at Ex = 6.38 and 6.76 MeV\nis due to the 6.38-MeV membership of the ground-state (g.s.)\nrotational band. The 9Beg.s. is predicted to have a 5He +\u03b1\nstructure [14].\nThe branching ratio results obtained from the 2.43-MeV\nstate are discussed in Ref. [22]. For the other two states\njust above breakup threshold (Ex = 2.78 and 3.05 MeV),\nit has been shown that between 30 and 50% of events\npopulating these states decay to 8Beg.s., leaving the remaining\nevents to decay either via the 8Be2+ state or via the 5Heg.s..\nUnfortunately, there were not enough data to identify the\nrelative contributions for these two breakup channels. The\nbranching ratio estimate for the 3.05-MeV state to the 8Beg.s.\nseems small compared to the value given by Christensen and\nCocke (87 \u00b1 13%), although not unreasonable. The method\nused to remove contaminating events from the state at Ex =\n2.43 MeV was only partially successful. The large uncertainty\ngiven for the 8Beg.s. branching ratio reflects this outcome.\nThe branching ratio estimate for the 2.78-MeV state to\n8Be2+\/5Heg.s. is consistent with Prezado\u2019s remark [9] that a\nconsiderable contribution of the breakup does not go via the\n8Beg.s. for this state.\nThe present results compare favorably with theoretical pre-\ndictions as well as other experimental results. Descouvemont\n[15] calculated reduced widths for the three different channels\nusing a microscopic three-cluster model of 9Be for states with\na spin of up to 9\/2. The reduced width and the branching ratio\nfor a given channel are related by an unknown penetrability,\nthe calculation of which is not trivial for broad intermediate\nstates such as the 8Be2+ state and the 5Heg.s.. However, it can\nbe shown that the branching ratios do reproduce the theoretical\ntrend of these reduced widths.\nThe astrophysical implications of these new branching\nratios are unclear. For the astrophysically relevant states, with\nthe exception of the 2.43-MeV state, this work provides only\nupper limits for the 5Heg.s and the 8Be2+ channels. Although it\nis clear that a significant portion of the breakup yield for these\nstates does not go via the 8Beg.s., this may have little effect\non the \u03b1\u03b1n rate. Buchmann et al. [20] derived the population\ndensity for the three intermediate states over a temperature\nrange applicable to the site for the \u03b1\u03b1n reaction in a supernova.\nThe results indicate that the 8Be2+ state will not contribute\nsignificantly to the \u03b1\u03b1n rate.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nT.
