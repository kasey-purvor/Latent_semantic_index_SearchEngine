They and their customers want to under-\nstand better how these online resources are used.\nPublishers want to know how the information \nthey produce and disseminate is being accessed.\nLibrarians and other customers want better insights\ninto the way the information they purchase from a\nrange of vendors is being used, and also whether\nthey are receiving value for money. Meeting these\npublisher and customer objectives requires usage\nstatistics that are credible, compatible and con-\nsistent. An important step towards achieving this\nhas been the development of agreed international\nCodes of Practice governing the recording and\nexchange of usage data. \nThe first COUNTER Code of Practice, covering\njournal and databases1, was published in 2003 and\nhas now become a well-established and widely-\nused industry standard, providing both vendors\nand their customers with useful insights into the\nonline usage of these products. The COUNTER\nCode of Practice for Books and Reference Works2\nhas the potential to do the same.\nRelease 1 of the COUNTER Code of Practice for\nBooks and Reference Works was published in 2006\nand provides an international standard for vendor\nrecording and reporting of the usage of e-books\nand reference works. It has much in common with\nthe well-established COUNTER Code of Practice\nfor Journals and Databases but it also has a num-\nber of important features that take into account the\ngreater diversity of e-books. As technology and \ne-book publishing models evolve, the Code of\nPractice will be revised and modified, with new\n\u2018Releases\u2019 that will take new developments into\naccount. This approach has worked well for\njournals and databases\nIn July 2009 there were 23 vendors compliant\nwith the Code of Practice for Books and Reference\nWorks. More vendors need to follow their example\nand become compliant with this Code of Practice.\nA rapidly expanding number of e-books are\nbecoming available; libraries are purchasing access\nto these and librarians expect to be provided with\ncredible usage statistics to help them assess the\nvalue of the e-books and packages of books that\nthey buy3,4. COUNTER-compliant vendors are able\nto do this by providing their customers with\ncredible usage statistics in a familiar, recognized\nformat. \nThe full text of Release 1 of the COUNTER Code\nof Practice for Books and Reference Works is freely\nSerials \u2013 22(3) supplement, November 2009 Peter T Shepherd and Hazel Woodward COUNTER CoP for Books\nS39\nThe COUNTER Code of Practice for\nBooks and Reference Works \u2013 a primer\nRelease 1 of the COUNTER Code of Practice for\nBooks and Reference Works was published in\n2006 and provides an international standard for\nvendor recording and reporting of the usage \nof e-books and reference works.

It has much in common with the well-\nestablished COUNTER Code of Practice for\nJournals and Databases but it also has a number\nof important features that take into account the\ngreater diversity of e-books.This article provides\na guide to the Code of Practice for both vendors\nand librarians, and addresses compliance issues\nrelevant to both groups.\nPETER T SHEPHERD\nDirector\nCOUNTER\nHAZEL WOODWARD\nUniversity Librarian,\nCranfield University and\nChair of COUNTER Board\nof Directors\nCOUNTER CoP for Books Peter T Shepherd and Hazel Woodward Serials \u2013 22(3) supplement, November 2009\nS40\naccessible on the COUNTER website5 . This primer\nis designed to provide those e-book vendors who\nwish to become COUNTER compliant with further\nguidance on how to do so. The primary features of\nthe Code of Practice, as well as the main steps to be\ntaken for compliance, are described below.\nDefinitions of terms used\nThe original Code of Practice for Journals and\nDatabases contains an extensive list of data\nelements and other terms used in the usage reports\nand other parts of the Code 6. This has been\nexpanded to cover books and reference works. New\ndefinitions include:\n\u25a0 chapter: a subdivision of a book or of some\ncategories of reference work; usually numbered\nand titled\n\u25a0 entry: a record of information in some categories\nof reference work (e.g. a dictionary definition)\n\u25a0 reference work: an authoritative source of\ninformation about a subject: used to find quick\nanswers to questions \n\u25a0 section: a subdivision of a book or reference\nwork (e.g. chapter, entry).\nAs with journals and databases, where an\nappropriate existing definition exists this has been\nused and the source, such as NISO (the National\nInformation Standards Organization), has been\ngiven. The other definitions were developed by the\nCOUNTER e-books task force, using a number of\nsources.\nAlso defined are the protocols to be observed\nwhen an aggregator or gateway is involved in the\ndelivery of vendor content to the customer. These\nprotocols are particularly important to avoid\nduplicate counting of usage by publisher and\naggregator in situations where an intermediary\naggregator or gateway is involved.\nData processing and auditing\nThe way usage records are generated differs from\none platform to another and it is impractical to\ndescribe all the possible filters used to clean up the\ndata. Instead, the Code of Practice specifies the\nrequirements to be met by the data to be used for\nbuilding the usage reports. A guiding principle is\nthat only intended usage should be recorded, and\nall requests that are not intended by the user are\nremoved. To this end, all double clicks on an\nHTTP-link within ten seconds of each other will be\ncounted as only one request. Where a PDF-link is\ninvolved, this filter is set at 30 seconds, due to the\nlonger time it takes to render a PDF.\nAuditing of vendor usage reports and processes\nby an approved third party is not required for\nRelease 1, but it will be a requirement for\ncompliance with future Releases of the Code of\nPractice. \nUsage reports\nThe Code of Practice provides a set of six basic\nusage reports that cover full-text requests for a\nwhole title, as well as for sections (chapters, encyclo-\npaedia entries, etc.) within a title. Searches, sessions\nand turnaways are also covered.\nThese reports are:\nBook Report 1: Number of Successful Title Requests\nby Month and Title (BR1)\nBook Report 2: Number of Successful Section\nRequests by Month and Title (BR2)\nBook Report 3: Number of Turnaways by Month\nand Title (BR3)\nBook Report 4: Turnaways by Month and Service\n(BR4)\nBook Report 5: Total Searches and Sessions by\nMonth and Title (BR5)\nBook Report 6: Total Searches and Sessions by\nMonth and Service (BR6)\nThe list of vendors compliant with the Code of\nPractice for Books and Reference Works is shown\nin Table 1.\nThe report formats, data processing guidelines\nand delivery protocols are largely the same as\nthose already in use for journals and databases.\nLikewise, searches, sessions and turnaways have\nbeen defined in the same way as for journals and\ndatabases, and the usage reports relating to these\n(3,4, 5 and 6 above) parallel those for journals and\ndatabases. The new reports are Book Report 1 and\nBook Report 2. Examples of both reports are shown\nin Figures 1 and 2.\nSerials \u2013 22(3) supplement, November 2009 Peter T Shepherd and Hazel Woodward COUNTER CoP for Books\nS41\nFigure 1.

The pro-\ncedure is as follows: \nStep 1: Review the Code of Practice for Books and\nReference Works on the COUNTER website at\nhttp:\/\/www.projectcounter.org\/cop\/books\/cop_\nbooks_ref.pdf \nStep 2: Decide which of the usage reports listed in\nSection 4 of the Code of Practice are relevant to\nyour publications. Note: to be compliant you will\nbe required to provide:\n\u25a0 either Book Report 1 or Book Report 2\nAND\n\u25a0 either Book Report 5 or Book Report 6.\nBook Report 3 and\/or Book Report 4 will be\nrequired only where the title or service is provided\non the basis of a simultaneous user licence.\nStep 3: Ensure that the terms in the selected usage\nreports are consistent with the COUNTER defin-\nitions of these terms, which are found in Section 3\nof the Code of Practice.\nStep 4: Ensure that you adhere to the customer\ncategory requirements for usage reports as\nspecified in Section 4.2 of the Code of Practice and\nto the report delivery specifications in Section 4.3.\nStep 5: Follow the rules for data processing, as\noutlined in Section 5 of the Code of Practice.\nIf expertise does not exist within the organization\nto convert the raw logfiles into the COUNTER\nusage reports (by applying the required data\nfilters, formatting the resulting usage statistics\naccording to the specifications of the COUNTER\nCOUNTER CoP for Books Peter T Shepherd and Hazel Woodward Serials \u2013 22(3) supplement, November 2009\nS42\nFigure 2. Book Report 2: Number of Successful Section Requests by Month and Title (Full title and ISBN are listed.)\nNote:\n1. For \u2018criteria\u2019 specify, for example, the organizational level to which the usage reports refer, e.g.\n\u2018Harvard University\u2019, \u2018Department of Chemistry\u2019.\n2. the \u2018Total for all titles\u2019 line is provided at the top of the Table to allow it to be stripped out without\ndisrupting the rest of the Table, as the number of titles included may vary from one month to another.\nBook Report 2 is designed to allow the vendor to measure usage of individual sections within a title. A \u2018section\u2019 is\nthe next level of organizational structure below the complete title, such as \u2018chapter\u2019 or \u2018entry\u2019. We felt that this single\nreport based on the more comprehensive definition was more appropriate than having separate reports for \u2018chapter\u2019,\n\u2018entry\u2019, etc., as a title whose structure is based on \u2018chapters\u2019 is unlikely to contain \u2018entries\u2019 and vice versa.\nreports, etc.), there are a number of suppliers who\ncan provide this service. They are listed on the\nCompliant Vendors page of the COUNTER\nwebsite 7. Vendors who require further advice on\nsuppliers may contact COUNTER directly (e-mail:\npshepherd@projectCounter.org). \nStep 6: Having prepared the relevant usage reports\naccording to the specifications of the Code of\nPractice, inform the COUNTER office by e-mail\n(pshepherd@projectCounter.org) that the reports\nare ready. The COUNTER office will arrange for\nthe reports to be reviewed by our library test sites.\nStep 7: Once the usage reports are approved as\nbeing COUNTER compliant by the library test\nsites, the vendor will be required to complete and\nsign the Declaration of COUNTER Compliance\n(Appendix B of the Code of Practice) and to pay\nthe Vendor Registration Fee of \u00a3250. (This fee is\nwaived for COUNTER members). When this\nprocess is completed the vendor will be added to\nthe Register of Vendors on the COUNTER website.\nOnly vendors and reports listed there may be\nregarded as being COUNTER compliant. \nVendors who are already compliant with the Code\nof Practice for Journals and Databases have to\napply separately for compliance with the Code of\nPractice for Books and Reference Works.\nLibrarians: how to encourage vendors to\nprovide COUNTER-compliant usage statistics\nMost larger publishers, if they publish e-books, are\ncapable of generating the relevant COUNTER\nusage reports. Smaller publishers of e-books may\nnot have this capability, but a number of suppliers\nnow provide this service. These suppliers are listed\nin the COUNTER Register of Vendors8. In this\ncontext it is now reasonable for librarians to insert\nthe following clause in all vendor licences covering\ne-books:\n\u2018The licensor confirms to the licensee that usage\nstatistics covering the online usage of the books\nincluded in this licence will be provided. The licensor\nfurther confirms that such usage statistics will\nadhere to the specifications of the COUNTER Code of\nPractice, including data elements collected and their\ndefinitions; data processing guidelines; usage report\ncontent, format, frequency and delivery method\u2019.\nNext steps\nAs a significant number of vendors only became\ncompliant with Release 1 of this Code of Practice in\nthe course of 2009, we have decided to take more\ntime to monitor how this Release is working from\nthe perspective of vendors and libraries before\nfirming up the timetable for refining the COUNTER\nusage reports for books and reference works.\nDuring the remainder of 2009 and in 2010 we shall\nsystematically obtain feedback from vendors and\ntheir customers and will use this to inform the next\nRelease. Users are also encouraged to submit\ncomments direct to COUNTER via the website.\nWe shall also be taking into account the findings\nof the JISC national e-books observatory project,\nwhose final results will be available during 20099. \nAnnouncements for the timetable and process\nfor the development of the next Release of the\nCode of Practice for Books and Reference Works\nwill be made on the COUNTER website. We do not\nanticipate publishing a new Release before mid\n2010, with implementation no earlier than 2011.\nFurther information\nVendors, publishers or librarians seeking further\ninformation on compliance with the Code of Practice\nfor Books and Reference Works, or on any other\naspect of COUNTER, please contact the Project\nDirector, Dr Peter T Shepherd (details below).\nReferences\n1.
