In this \ncontext, rules are post-fact descriptions of patterns noticed. The priority afforded discovery of patterns is \nlinked in this paper to cognitivist views of learning (McClelland & Rumelhart 1986; Anderson, 1983 in \nCook 1993). \nThe paper then goes on to discuss the accuracy of rules transmitted in EFL classrooms. It is argued that \nteachers' awareness of the language is sometimes misinformed and that in addition half-truths may be \npresented to learners for the sake of simplifying a complex reality. This has the potential to cause \nmisconceptions, i.e. false awareness, among learners. Data from three different studies (Svalberg 1997 and \n1998b, Svalberg & Hjh Fatimah 1998) are presented to demonstrate some misconceptions held by learners \nwhich may have been caused or reinforced by instruction. Such false awareness is potentially a serious \nproblem as it could hinder further progress in the language. The paper closes with a brief discussion of what \nwe might do to avoid false awareness being propagated in the EFL classroom. \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis paper addresses the issue of false awareness, i.e. misconceptions held by teachers and\/or \nlearners, in the area of grammar, but the main points may well be applicable to awareness in \nother areas of language1. The distinction sometimes made between 'consciousness' and \n'awareness' (James 1992) will be ignored and the term 'consciousness raising' (CR) will \nsometimes be used for the process by which a state of relatively higher language awareness (LA) \nmight be achieved.  \nThe fact that LA implies conscious reflection on the language invites a comparison with \ntraditional methods of teaching. One important difference between a LA approach and traditional \n  \n \n2 \ngrammar instruction is the role played by rules. I will distinguish between two different types of \nrules: what I call 'language manual rules' and 'language awareness rules'. By the former I mean a \nset of rules that the learner memorizes from a book or the white board and, if s\/he is a successful \nlearner, learns to apply. The rules are imposed 'from above' by experts such as teachers and \ngrammarians. It is questionable how much use language manual rules are to the learner (Borg \n1996).  \nIn the ideal case, the role of rules in a LA approach is not as \"a body of externally, objectively \ndefined knowledge to be studied\" (Borg 1996, p.119) but rather as after-the-fact descriptions of \nlinguistic patterns that the learner has observed. One advantage of the latter is that it can help \nremind the learner of a more complex and subtle linguistic reality than is easily contained in the \nwords of a rule. It is important for this linguistic reality to be one that the learner has discovered \nand therefore has personal, conscious experience of. \nThe nature of grammar rules has been debated in the last few years, partly because of work in \ncognitive frameworks (see discussion of Anderson's ACT in Cook 1993, pp. 246-250; Ellis 1994, \npp.403-408 on connectionism). According to connectionists (e.g. McClelland & Rumelhart \n1986), the language learning process does not consist of learning rules and how to apply them. A \nbetter description of the process, according to Mitchell & Myles (1998, p.82), is that learners \nregister associative patterns in the language which then become reinforced with use. The \nreinforcement of the associative patterns takes the form of a strengthening of neurological \nnetworks of connections. \nAn example of an observation which might become a rule in a learner's interlanguage is \n'people use \/d\/ on verbs when they talk about the past'. Such a simple observation would need to \nbe followed by other observations in order for the rule to be expanded and refined. How such a \n  \n \n3 \nrule should best be described is beyond the scope of this paper (but c.f. for example 'production \nrules', Anderson 1983 in Cook 1993, p.249).  \nBecause they encourage the discovery of patterns, LA approaches may prove to be a more \neffective way to help learners progress in a language. For the same reason, the potential to \nmislead and misinform is perhaps greater than ever and the accuracy of grammar rules (as \ndescriptions of patterns) is vitally important. If learning a language does not mean learning to \napply its rules but rather re-creating the rules by recognizing patterns, then we had better make \nsure that the patterns we help students discover are the right ones. \nThe term 'awareness' in LA implies that we make learners aware of facts about the language. \nThe question raised here is to what extent we know the facts. That misconceptions and half-truths \nare prevalent in EFL grammar instruction is backed up by some of my own research findings (see \nbelow). Lock and Tsui (2000: 19), apparently share this concern as one of the aims of their \nelectronic grammar database for teachers in Hongkong is \"to explicitly address common \nmisconceptions and potentially misleading half-truths\". It would not be surprising then if \ninstruction sometimes contributes to false language awareness. \nBelow, a few examples of false awareness exhibited by learners of English will be discussed. \nThe ones chosen are likely to  have been fostered or at least reinforced by instruction. There are, \nunfortunately, many ways in which misconceptions can be transmitted. Four potential sources \nwill be exemplified: 1) misleading factual information, 2) misleading terminology 3) misleading \nillustrations and 4) misleading contexts. The possible implications of false awareness will then \nbe discussed and some suggestions made as to what can be done to avoid false awareness being \npropagated. \n \n  \n \n4 \n \nMISCONCEPTIONS AND HALF-TRUTHS \nOne half-truth propagated through instruction is that English has three tenses: past, present \nand future. In fact, English has two tenses only: past and present (or non-past) (Reichenbach \n1957, Comrie 1985, Svalberg 1986, 1991, 1995). While there are, as we all know, many ways of \nexpressing future events in English, there are good reasons for not considering that there is a \nfuture tense as such. One is that there is no inflectional future form. Another is that all the forms \nthat can refer to future time frequently have other meanings as well. From a teaching perspective, \npresenting future as a tense on a par with past and present has the potential to obscure patterns of \ntense use in English, e.g. tense agreement. \nThe relationship of verb forms to tense meanings is arguably one of the most important \nassociative patterns in the English grammar. It can be represented as follows:   \n \nFigure 1 The English tense system (adapted from Svalberg 1991) \n                      PAST \n \n                     PRESENT \n \n  had gone        went         would go   have gone          go           will go \n        |                x                  |         |                 x                  | \n      BEFORE      AT                 AFTER      BEFORE         AT                  AFTER \n \nThe verb forms in fig.1, i.e. had gone, went etc., are ways of expressing the tense relationships \nin the figure. Other forms can also be used, e.g. past and present progressive for events at or after \npast or present, but the relationship is not random; present progressive cannot be used to mean an \nevent before present, for example. \nThe obscuring of the concept of past and present reference time (the 'x' points in fig.1) is a \nmajor weakness in most teaching of tense. The importance of learning to recognize past and \n  \n \n5 \npresent is that (when we refer to time) all past tense verb forms relate events to a past reference \ntime only (left half of fig.1) and all present tense forms relate events to the speaker's present \n(right half of fig.1). Somewhat simplified, one can say that tense agreement consists of learning \nto use past tense when the reference time is past and present tense when the reference time is \npresent (see Svalberg 1991, 1995).  \nThe different verb forms refer to events before, at or after either past or present. Perfect forms, \nfor example, always refer to events before either past (past perfect) or present (present perfect). \nForms with would are multifunctional and are one of several ways of referring to events after the \npast as in for example I knew she would be 18 by then.  \nIn summary, the concept of past and present reference time can help highlight patterns of \nlanguage use which are otherwise difficult for learners to discern. Such patterns - which the \nlearner can subsequently translate into rules - include which verb forms encode which of the \nmeanings in Fig.1, i.e. patterns of tense agreement and sequencing of events. \nPart of the problem with teaching the use of verb forms is the term 'tense'. In its technical \nsense, 'tense' means reference time, i.e. past or present, as shown above. It is, however, frequently \nused in a more everyday sense to mean 'verb form'. Thus one can see references to 'progressive \ntense', 'perfect tense', 'past progressive tense', 'present progressive tense' and so on. A learner \ncould be excused for feeling totally bewildered. If instead we used 'tense' only to refer to past or \npresent reference time, we would be better placed to put across the correct associative patterns of \nboth English tense and aspect. The term 'aspect' can be used for progressive, perfect and simple2, \nthough to some classroom practitioners it may seem too 'technical'. Most of the time, the problem \ncan be avoided by using nothing in place of the word 'tense', i.e. 'the progressive' rather than the \n  \n \n6 \nmisleading usage 'the progressive tense'. This would involve EFL teachers examining and \nperhaps modifying their own language awareness, but it would seem an effort worth making. \nThe observant reader may object at this point that so called 'past' verb forms are often used for \npresent events, e.g. to mark politeness or tentativeness as in I was wondering if you wanted to \ncome too and that past reference time is therefore not a useful construct. This can be shown to be \nan untenable position on theoretical grounds (Comrie 1985; Svalberg 1991) and, from a \nteaching\/learning perspective, it is precisely because the grammar is far from transparent that the \nbasic use of past verb forms for past time needs to be highlighted first. One can then build on that \nwhen teaching other non-time related uses of past (see discussion of 'distance' in Svalberg 1991; \n1995). \nAnother misconception often encountered among students as well as teachers is the idea that \nthe present perfect means that the event happened recently. That this is not so can easily be \ndemonstrated: \n1. People have always adorned their bodies in different ways. \n2. I've been to Paris. What an experience! Must be nearly thirty years ago now. \nIn neither of the two examples is the event recent. The fact that the Present Perfect is \nfrequently used for recent events is because such events are more frequently mentioned and more \nlikely to have 'current relevance' than distant events. Nevertheless, it is not recentness but 'current \nrelevance', sometimes in the form of results or experiences, which is conveyed by the Present \nPerfect3. In some of the more recent EFL text books this is very clearly put across but others still \noveremphasize the importance of the collocation 'just + present perfect'. The context can then \nbecome misleading by being over-represented in the input. \n  \n \n7 \nThat instruction may have a role to play in the misperception of present perfect was indicated \nby the results of a meaning perceptions test (Svalberg 1997 and 'forthcoming'). As the test is not \nthe main subject of this paper, most of the information regarding it is to be found in Appendix 1, \nbut some is required here: Each test item contained an underlined verb form embedded in a \nminimum of context (see 3 and 4 below); the subjects were 43 native and 66 non-native speakers \nof English, the latter Malay L1 speakers in Brunei who, based on an earlier test result, were \ndivided into a top group (N=32) and a bottom group (N=34). For each item, the subjects were \nasked to choose a maximum of three meanings in a multiple choice matrix to indicate the \nmeaning of the underlined words. \nThe meaning perceptions test confirmed that time depth played an important role in the \nlearners' perceptions of past and  present perfect, though not entirely as expected. The test items \ncontaining present perfect were the following: \n \n3. the students have written the essays \n4. the girls have arrived \n \nThe multiple choice matrix for these items included the meanings 'a long time ago' and 'a short \ntime ago'. The table below represents the replies to these options for items 3 and 4 taken together \nand shows that more non-native than native speakers associated present perfect with time depth, \nespecially recent time. \n \n  \n \n8 \nTable 1 Proportion of subjects who indicated that present perfect means 'a short\/long time \nago' \n      'a short time ago'   'a long time ago' \nNative Speakers         23.5%      1.5% \nTop Group          50.5%    20.5% \nBottom Group         47%      7.5% \nThe top & bottom groups are non-native speakers of English. \n \nBecause of the range of possible contexts for the test items, there were no right answers as \nsuch in the meaning perceptions test. What it aimed to measure was to what extent the non-native \nspeakers deviated from the patterns of associations evident in the native speaker group. \nAbout twice as many non-native speakers as native speakers felt that recentness was a salient \nmeaning of the present perfect and perceptions in this regard did not become more native-like \nwith higher proficiency. In addition, over 20% of the most proficient learners  chose 'a long time \nago'. The perception that time depth was involved was thus very prevalent among the non-native \nspeakers. The figures, especially for the more proficient learners, indicate that it would be \nunhelpful to reinforce time depth notions in the classroom by an overemphasis on such contexts. \nIn a grammaticality judgement test taken by the same subjects (Svalberg 1998b; see also \nAppendix 1) another learner misconception to come to light was that Past Perfect could be used \nin the following context: \n \n5. As Ms Edwards had broken her leg, class is cancelled today. \n \nNearly 66% of the top learners and 73.5% of the bottom learners felt that this was \ngrammatical (Svalberg 1998b). The reason this sentence is in fact ungrammatical is that the past \n  \n \n9 \nperfect denotes an event before a past reference time (see fig.1) and no such past time can be \nretrieved. That learners would make this mistake is not surprising considering that past perfect is \nusually very late acquired, if at all (Bardovi-Harlig 1994). One way of 'making sense' of it, is to \nuse it as a marker of completedness, regardless of tense, and this may be what the learners did in \nthe grammaticality judgement test (Svalberg 1998b). The tense pattern of past and present \nreference times, displayed in fig.1, needs to be noticed first for learners to discover how past \nperfect is used in conjunction with tense agreement rules. This illustrates the importance of using \nthe term 'tense' in a clarifying way and to highlight basic 'tense for time' patterns as suggested \nabove. \nThere are other indications that instruction may be less than helpful. In the meaning \nperceptions test, learners also associated the past perfect more strongly with time depth than the \nnative speakers did and this non-nativelike tendency became stronger as they became more \nproficient. The test items containing past perfect were:  \n \n6. the girls had slept \n7. Kassim had opened the door \n \nThe following table represents the replies to 6 and 7 taken together and shows the extent to \nwhich the different groups associated past perfect in these items with time depth: \n \nTable 2 Proportion of subjects who indicated that Past Perfect means 'a short\/long time ago' \n      \"a short time ago\"    \"a long time ago\" \nNative Speakers  19%   5% \n  \n \n10 \nTop Group   23.5%            36% \nBottom Group  23.5%            16.5% \nThe top & bottom groups are non-native speakers of English. \n \nThe figures in table 2 show that as learners become more proficient they become more prone \nto perceiving past perfect as referring to events a long time ago. Though this may be true in a \nparticular sentence, it is not generally true as demonstrated by the following exchange:  \n \n8. - What's the matter? \n- Oh, I'm upset! I talked to Dave. I'd just told him I was preparing for this horrible \ninspection and then he asked me to type thirty pages for him! \nI've  always been there for him - that's the trouble. \n \nIn the mini-dialogue, the present perfect have been stretches back further in time than the past \nperfect had told. This demonstrates that distance in time (time depth) is of no importance, i.e. it is \nnot encoded, in the English tense system. What is important is sequence of events and whether \nevents are related to the past or the present. \nMisleading illustrations can reinforce this misconception. In the classroom, timelines are \nsometimes used in an attempt to clarify the use of the past perfect. The following is an \nunfortunate example: \n \nFigure 2 A misleading illustration of the past perfect \n \n     had got into bed      the phone rang           NOW \n \n  \n \n11 \n \nIn the sentence I had just got into bed when the phone rang the event in the past perfect is \nindeed further away from the present than the event in the past simple and so the representation \nin fig.2 would seem quite adequate. The problem is the impression that past perfect generally \nencodes (or 'means') an event further away in time from the present than past simple. However, it \nis quite possible to have a past simple and a past perfect in the same text which do not stand in \nthis out-of-sequence relationship to each other and where the past perfect does not denote an \nevent further away in time than the past simple, just as (in 8 above) a past perfect event can be \ncloser in time than a present perfect event. It is the inclusion of the present on the time line which \ncreates the false impression of time depth. \nTo summarize, the past perfect says nothing about how long ago the event happened, only that \nit happened before another time in the past (fig.2). Classroom instruction which does not make \nthe distinction between past and present reference time clear is therefore likely to contribute to \ndifficulties in the acquisition of the past perfect. We will return to this when considering \nimplications. \nThe discussion above has highlighted the possibility of leading learners astray by the misuse \nof terminology, illustrations and contexts. A narrow range of contexts can perpetuate another \nhalf-truth: that would means 'not a fact' or, 'unreality'. It is true, of course, that would is used in \nsome non-factive contexts, e.g. conditionals. In text books it is often presented in highly \nspeculative contexts such as if I won the lottery I would ....  Except for polite expressions with \nlike and similar, would is otherwise rarely discussed in text books. What is hardly ever dealt with \nis would for past habit. In this use, would is factual as it describes an event that actually took \n  \n \n12 \nplace, e.g. My grandpa would have his tea under that tree. Unreality is thus not a meaning of \nwould, but a feature of some of the contexts in which it is frequently found.  \nThe findings from the meaning perceptions test confirm that unreality is a more salient \nmeaning of would for learners than for native speakers and this misperception becomes more \nprevalent as learners become more proficient. There were six items containing would (see \nAppendix 1), an example being: \n \n9.  the girls would sleep   \n \nAmong the options in the multiple choice matrix, were 'fact' and 'not a fact'. \n Table 3, a summary of the responses to these options for the six items with would, shows \nthat the learner subjects were more prone than the control group to associate would with the \noption 'not a fact': \n \n  \n \n13 \nTable 3 Proportion of subjects who indicated that would means 'not a fact' \n  Native Speakers 5.7%   \n  Top Group   23.2%   \n  Bottom Group 11.2% \nThe top & bottom groups are non-native speakers of English. \n \n \nAs we saw above, it is true that would in certain contexts indicates a greater degree of \nunreality (or lesser degree of likelihood) than will  and so one cannot say that the learners who \nchose 'not a fact' are 'wrong'. Rather, to the extent that they made this choice more often than the \nnative speakers, their knowledge is skewed. The fact that the tendency, consistent across the six \ntest items, became more marked as the subjects became more proficient makes it plausible that \ninstruction, perhaps in the form of a misleading range of contexts, has played a part here. \nThe factual use of would was brought to my attention by some conversation data I also \nobtained in Brunei. A group of 5 Malay speaking learners and a group of 4 native English \nspeakers were recorded having separate conversations in English, on the same topic and of \nroughly the same duration (Svalberg & Hjh Fatimah 1998). The non-native speaker subjects were \nprospective EFL teachers. As far as fluency and vocabulary were concerned, they might have \nbeen classed as upper intermediate level. The native speakers, practising EFL teachers, used \nwould 28 times, mostly for past habit. An example of this use from the native speakers' \nconversation is: and then I would also watch English programmes on TV which had Swedish \nsubtitles. In contrast, the non-native speakers did not use would a single time. Their reluctance or \ninability to use the modal in the given factual context could be explained if they, like the subjects \nin the meaning perceptions test, perceived unreality as a salient meaning of would.  \n  \n \n14 \nIn the Bruneian context, sociolinguistic factors, beyond the scope of the present paper (but see \nSvalberg 1998b and 'forthcoming'), almost certainly contribute to the learners' skewed \nperception4 of would. Whatever the reasons, the highlighting of its use in a narrow range of non-\nfactive contexts to the virtual exclusion of other uses has the potential to reinforce rather than \ncorrect learners' false awareness. \n \nImplications \nIt has been shown that learners have some misconceptions about English, which is not in itself \nsurprising. The reason the particular misconceptions discussed above are noteworthy is that 1) \nthey do not decrease with higher proficiency, instead they sometimes become more marked, 2) it \nis likely that instruction has contributed to the misconceptions.  \nIt is also likely that further progress can be hampered by such false awareness. It can be \nassumed that the extent to which learners are able to expand and improve their command at time \n't' depends partly on the state of their knowledge at 't'. To explore the implications, one can think \nof language as an enormous and very complex puzzle. Each piece of a puzzle has a number of \nprotruding portions which give it an awkward shape but which are essential if it is to connect \nwith the surrounding pieces in the puzzle. If the piece is the wrong shape to start with or if the \nawkward bits are chopped off to make it tidier, then it won't fit into the puzzle and the puzzle \ncannot be completed. Each bit of language awareness then, has the potential to help or to hinder \nfurther progress. Simplifying or skewing the truth may be tantamount to 'chopping off the \nawkward bits' and one needs to be aware of this. \nFor the learners discussed above the piece of the puzzle containing would had the wrong \nshape, probably partly due to instruction. They felt quite strongly that would meant unreality. \n  \n \n15 \nThis, I would argue, could interfere with their acquisition of factive would for past habit, at least \nuntil a teacher (or real life misunderstanding) actively intervenes to correct their awareness.   \nLearners' attempts to make sense of the input they get will thus interact with their \nmisconceptions. The persistence of the idea that perfect has something to do with time depth \ncould indicate an attempt by the learners to construct their own interim tense system. The \nfollowing is one possibility: \n \nFigure 3 A possible, though inaccurate, interim English tense system: \n* A long time ago \nhad gone \nGeneral past \nwent \nRecently \nhave gone \nPresent \ngo  \n \nThis tense system is reminiscent of the misleading time line shown above (fig.2). As \ndemonstrated in fig.1 and example 8 (above) the perception of English tense displayed in fig.3 is \nincorrect, but it is a plausible learner hypothesis. From a cognitive point of view, it would not be \nsurprising or unnatural for learners to assume such a system. In many languages time depth is \nindeed the organizing principle, e.g. reportedly in the North-American Indian language Kiksht \n(Hymes 1975, discussed in Svalberg 1991): \n \nFigure 4 A different kind of tense system: Kiksht (N. American Indian; data from Hymes 1975, \nadapted from Svalberg 1991)  \n       Present \n           0 \nBeyond a \nyear \nWithin a \nseasonal round \nYesterday Today Future \n  \n \n16 \ngal nig nal ig al \n \nIn Kiksht, a verb with the suffix -nig denotes an event further away in time than a verb with -\nnal, and events a long time ago are expressed by verbs ending in -gal. Time depth is a central \nnotion in this tense system as in many others, e.g. in Bantu languages which have special \n'narrative tenses' (Dahl 1985). \nThere does not seem to be any cognitive reason to assume, then, that learners will \nautomatically hypothesize an English-type tense system. In addition, it is quite difficult to deduce \nfrom input how English tense works (Svalberg 1998a). Endings like -ed and -ing are used not \nonly on verbs but also on adjectives (-ed, -ing) and nouns (-ing); past forms are used with present \ntime reference and non-finite verbs can be difficult to distinguish from finite ones (e.g. past \nsimple from past participle). The input learners get through instruction is therefore crucial. This \nis especially so for learners who either have time depth notions in their L1 verb system or \nlearners who have tenseless L1, e.g. speakers of Chinese, Malay, Arabic.   \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nIt was argued in the introduction that LA rules are after-the-fact descriptions of patterns \nobserved. It is however important to recognize that not all patterns which language aware \nlearners, or indeed teachers, may notice in input will automatically lead to correct rules. Rules \nbased on frequency can be misleading. Learners may, for example, notice that the correlation of \nrecentness of events with the use of present perfect is quite high or that would is used in certain \nsyntactic constructions which refer to unreal events. I have tried to show that accurate \nobservations such as these are not necessarily sufficient. If other, complementary observations \n  \n \n17 \nare not made which allow the rules to be expanded and modified, these observations could result \nin the creation of false awareness of the kind described in this paper.  \nIt was argued above that false LA can in fact hinder further progress. One example was the \nstrong association of would with unreality which is likely to impede or slow down the acquisition \nof would for past habitual events. The association of present and past perfect with time depth \ncould potentially lead to an un-English interpretation of the whole tense system. It is hard to see, \nfinally, how the past perfect could be acquired at all if the pattern of relationships between past \nverb forms and past and present reference time has not been acquired first.  \nTo avoid spreading false LA, we - EFL teachers and other EFL professionals - need to do \nmore to check our own awareness and improve and expand it constantly. As Borg (1994, p.63) \nstates: \n \nTeachers need to develop a disposition to constantly review their own beliefs about \nlanguage, and to be open to the possibility that these may require modification. \n \nThis can be extended to language professionals generally, not just teachers - we are all learners.  \nA positive development is that increased research on authentic language, i.e. use of corpora, \ncould mean great strides being made in the formulation of more accurate rules which would \neventually benefit teachers and learners. New insights into English such as current views on tense \nand the use of articles (e.g. Master 1997) also need to be passed on to teachers on a regular basis, \ne.g. through in-service courses.  \nDespite what has been said about the importance of accurate rules, simplification for learners \nis sometimes unavoidable. There seems to be no reason to hide this fact. On the contrary, the \n  \n \n18 \nincompleteness and temporariness of rules should be acknowledged (and can be indicated by the \nterm 'rule of thumb'). To the extent that rules are 'LA rules', i.e. descriptions of learners' \nobservations, they have the potential to expand and improve as the learner progresses. \nWhat this paper has wanted to address is the assumption that the LA displayed by teachers and \ntextbooks is unproblematic. I have tried to show that learners' awareness is sometimes false \nawareness quite likely to have been created or reinforced by instruction - misleading facts, \nterminology, illustrations and contexts - and that this can be a serious obstacle to further progress \nin the language. It has also been argued that in the LA classroom grammar rules should be seen \nas after-the-fact descriptions of patterns that learners notice in the course of the acquisition \nprocess, and that for these rules to be useful, they should coincide with the facts as encountered \nin authentic language. A solution to the false awareness problem has to start with EFL \nprofessionals improving and expanding our own language awareness.   \n \n \n  \n \n19 \nNotes \n1.  I am grateful to anonymous reviewers for helpful and incisive comments on this paper which was presented in \nan earlier version at the 5th International Conference of the Association for Language Awareness, 26-29 June \n2000, University of Leicester. \n2.  In my analysis (Svalberg 1991) 'simple' is one of three aspects in English, rather than an unmarked choice, as \nsimple verb forms can be shown to encode particular aspectual meanings distinct from either perfect or \nprogressive. \n3.  I take the view that as far as English is concerned, it is not necessary to distinguish experiential and \nresultative as distinct categories of perfect use. They can usefully be subsumed under the umbrella term \n'current relevance'. \n4.  Perceptions are 'skewed' from a Standard British English (STE) point of view though not necessarily from a \nlocal, non-standard perspective. It was assumed, however, that because of the instructional context the \nsubjects' aim was to supply STE replies. In a similar context (Svalberg & Hjh Fatimah 1998) the subjects \nclaimed that their target had been 'good English', i.e. the officially sanctioned STE variety. \n \n \nREFERENCES \nBardovi-Harlig, K.

The grammaticality judgement test is discussed in depth in \nSvalberg 1998b, the meaning perceptions test in Svalberg 1997 and Svalberg 'forthcoming'.  Both \ntests were administered to the same subjects: \n \n \nTable A.1 Subjects of the grammaticality judgement test and the meaning perceptions test. \n NS  \nControl \nNNS:  \nTop Group \nNNS:  \nMiddle Group \nNNS:  \nBottom Group \n 43 subjects 32 subjects 40 subjects 34 subjects \n           NS: Native speakers of English      NNS: Non-native speakers of English \n \n \nThe subjects were rank ordered for proficiency on the scores of a previous English Language \ntest. The non-native speaker subjects were Malay speaking first year students at Universiti Brunei \nDarussalam. The native English speakers were second year students at Edith Cowan University \nin Perth. The middle group is not referred to in the present paper. \nIn the grammaticality judgement test (Svalberg 1998b), the test items had to be judged for \ngrammaticality and, if judged to be unacceptable, the error had to be underlined. There were 20 \nitems; 11 correct and 9 incorrect. All the infelicities were tense or aspect errors.  \nIn the meaning perception test (Svalberg 1997 and 'forthcoming'), the test items had the \nfollowing format: \n \n \n  \n \n22 \nFigure A.1 An item in the meaning perceptions test. \n15. the girls would sleep. \nin the PRESENT  BEFORE another time  FINISHED   in the FUTURE  A FACT \nin the PAST        AFTER another time       GOING ON  ANYTIME           NOT A FACT \nI  DON'T KNOW \n \nThere were 32 items in all in this latter test, representing 16 different verb forms. In each item \nthe verb group was underlined. Items which contained past or present perfect had a slightly \ndifferent matrix in that 'in the future' and 'anytime' were replaced by 'a short time ago' and 'a long \ntime ago'. Following piloting which explored different types of instructions, the subjects were \ninstructed in Malay and English to choose a maximum of three options to show what the \nunderlined words, i.e. the verb groups,  meant. \nThe test items deliberately provided a minimal context, as can be seen in Fig.A.1. This may \nseem surprising as the full meaning of any verb, and modals in particular, are to a great extent a \nfunction of the context in which they appear. The purpose of the meaning perceptions test, \nhowever, was to find out what meanings were triggered by the verb forms per se and, especially, \nif there were differences in this respect between the native and non-native speaker subjects. An \nunderlying assumption was that no matter how minimal or incomplete the string, the subjects \nwould attempt to interpret it and in the process of doing so would activate or construct \nappropriate schemata. Any context provided would bias the interpretation process towards one \nmeaning or another. It was therefore crucial to keep the context as minimal and as neutral as \npossible. On the other hand, presenting the verbs on their own, e.g. as verb forms in a list, was \nruled out for a number of reasons and the simple arrangement shown in Fig.A.1, of subject +verb \nand, if required, object was chosen. In interpreting the verbs in these strings, the subjects were \n  \n \n23 \nthus forced to provide their own wider contexts. As a consequence, there was no one 'correct \nanswer' to each test item. Instead, replies were expected to be more or less 'native-like' depending \non what schemata the subjects had been able to construct or access.   \nAs far as the meaning perceptions test goes, the items referred to in this paper are the six test \nitems containing would: \n \n1.  the girls would sleep   \n2.  Kassim would open the door   \n \n3.  the boys would be arriving   \n4.  the student would be writing essays   \n \n5. the girls would have slept   \n6. Kassim would have opened the door   \n \nand the four items containing perfect forms  shown in the body of the text.   \n \n \n \n"}
