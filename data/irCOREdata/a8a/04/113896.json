Minett1, Carol Lynam1, Jiazhao Wang2, Gordon G. Wallace1,*\n1ARC Centre of Excellence for Electromaterials Science, Intelligent Polymer Research Institute, University of Wollongong,\nNSW 2522, Australia\n2Institute for Superconducting and Electronic Materials, University of Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia\nReceived Date ( inserted by publisher)\nRevised Received Date (inserted by publisher)\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) present a new  material  for  the  construction  of  electrodes.  The  large  scale  production  of\naligned carbon nanotube (ACNT) arrays was first reported by Dai and co-workers [1], providing an opportunity  to  develop\nhighly ordered, high surface  area  electrodes  with  excellent  electronic  and  mechanical  properties.  While  the  latter  two\nattributes are realized in the vertical direction, there is a need to develop simple methods of making ACNT  composites  that\nare mechanically robust and with sufficient conductivity in the horizontal direction. Such interconnects would give rise to  a\npractically useful electrode structure for use in applications such as energy storage [2], actuators [3] and sensors [4].\nAligned CNT growth, while producing innovative structures, suffers from a lack of good electrical  connectivity  between\nthe aligned tubes.  Growth on conducting substrates which would provide this  electrical  connection  has  met  with  limited\nsuccess; recently direct growth on metal alloys [5] has  been reported. Depositing metals selectively on top of CNT arrays to\nachieve this electrical connection [6] is fraught with difficulties. To realize the potential of these arrays in applications  such\nas flexible displays, their removal from the substrate used for growth is necessary.  Invariably,  removal  of  the  CNT  array\nfrom surfaces results in damage, including breakdown of any metal coated on top  to  achieve  an  electrical  connection.  To\naddress this issue of lack of robust electrical connection between nanotubes in an  array,  we  present  here  an  approach  for\npreparing a nanostructured ACNT\/conducting polymer composite. Organic conducting polymers have  proven  to  be  useful\nin the development of polymer-based composites [7-9]. In the novel nanostructure created here, the CNT\u2019s are held together\nby a conducting polymer composite layer.  The  nanotubes  remain  vertically  oriented  and  protrude  from  the  conducting\npolymer layer (90 % of the tube length is exposed). The  electrochemistry  of  the  nanostructured  electrodes  produced  and\ntheir use as the anode material in Li-ion batteries are presented.\nIn this study, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was utilised as  the  conducting  polymer  due  to  the  excellent\nelectrochemical activity and electronic conductivity attainable with this material. A thin  PEDOT  film  was  deposited  onto\nthe ACNT array by chemical vapour phase polymerization (CVP). The procedure used to form the nanostructured  electrode\nfrom a quartz plate is summarized  in  Scheme  1.  Aligned  multi-wall  carbon  nanotubes  were  produced  by  pyrolysis  of\niron(II) phthalocyanine as described by Dai [1,10]. Following production  of  the  aligned  CNTs  on  a  quartz  plate,  a  thin\nPEDOT  film  (100  nm  thickness  across  the  entire  film)  was   deposited   onto   ACNT   arrays   by   CVP   using   ferric\np-toluenesulfonate (Fe(III) tosylate)  as  oxidant.  The  SEM  image  of  this  ACNT\/PEDOT  composite  film  (insert  (a)  in\nScheme 1) indicates that the PEDOT deposited by VPP formed a continuous film  on  the  top  of  the  ACNT  array.  It  was\nfound that the PEDOT film was not sufficiently mechanically robust to  support  the  ACNT  array.  It  was  not  possible  to\nremove the ACNT\/PEDOT film from the quartz plate as a free-standing film. To overcome this problem, a  second  coating,\nconsisting of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), was  cast  onto  the  PEDOT  film  from  a  10%  (w\/w)  PVDF  acetonitrile\nsolution. The PVDF layer (0.5 ?m thickness across the entire film) provided the mechanical robustness required to  peel  the\nresultant flexible electrode film from the quartz plate. An example of this free-standing, highly flexible composite is  shown\nin insert (b) of Scheme 1. The composite film could be rolled up without any visual signs of degradation. The resulting free-\nstanding and flexible ACNT-based membrane electrode was then used as the anode material  in  a  rechargeable  lithium-ion\nbattery.\n[pic]\nScheme 1. Illustration of the procedures for the preparation of a free-standing and highly conductive ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF membrane\nelectrode: (a) spin-coating a thin iron (III) tosylate film onto an ACNT modified quartz plate; (b) CVP growth of  a  PEDOT  film  on  the\ntop of ACNT forest; (c) casting of a thin PVDF film; and (d) electrode structure peeled from the quartz plate as a  free-standing  robust\nmaterial.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig.1) of  the  ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF  membrane  electrode  show  a  clear\narray structure (Fig.1a) supported by a PEDOT\/PVDF composite film. The roots of the carbon nanotubes are held tightly by\nthe underlying PEDOT\/PVDF layer (Fig.1b,  obtained  for  a  stretched  (15%  strain)  electrode).  Even  upon  straining  the\nACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF  electrode  structure  remains  intact,  highlighting  the  robustness  of  the  composite  electrode.  The\naligned carbon nanotube layer was found to be adherent and was not removed by rubbing or abrasion on a hard surface.\nFigure  1.  SEM  images  of  ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF  membrane  electrodes;  (a)  after  peeling  (subsequent  to   stretching),   and   (b)\ndeliberately stretched (( 15%).\nThe conductivity of the ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF electrode was determined using a standard 4-probe system (Jandel Model  RM2).\nThe ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF membrane electrode had an electronic conductivity over 200 S cm-1, which is significantly  higher  than\nthat measured for an ACNT\/PVDF electrode (between 2 to 20 S cm-1) prepared under identical conditions  without  the  conductive\nPEDOT layer in the middle. This result is an average of 10 measurements across the sample, with less than 10% deviation between\neach measurement, which demonstrates the uniformity of the film structure. The PEDOT layer  is  obviously  critical  in  producing\ninterconnectivity between the aligned parallel tubes.\nThe electrochemical characteristics of the ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF nanostructured electrode were determined using a three-\nelectrode cell filled with 1.0 M  NaNO3\/H2O  and  comprising  a  working  electrode  (ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF),  an  auxiliary\nelectrode (platinum mesh), and  an  Ag\/AgCl  reference  electrode.  The  cyclic  voltammogram  (CV)  (Fig.  2(1))  shows  a\nrectangular  shape,  indicative  of   the   highly   capacitive   nature   of   the   ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF   electrode   with   rapid\ncharge\/discharge characteristics [11] when compared with  PEDOT\/PVDF  (Fig.  2(2)).  This  electrode  was  cycled  for  50\ncycles and no obvious degradation was observed.\nUsing methods described elsewhere [12], a 1 cm2 nanostructured ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF electrode  was  assembled  into  a\nlithium-ion battery for testing (Neware, Electronic Co.). The Lithium-ion testing cell was assembled in an argon-filled glove\nbox (Mbraun, Unilab, Germany) by stacking a porous  polypropylene  separator  containing  liquid  electrolyte  between  the\nACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF electrode and a lithium foil counter electrode. The electrolyte used was 1.0 M LiPF6 in a 50:50  (v\/v)\nmixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate supplied by Merck KgaA, Germany. The cell was cycled between 0.0\nand 2.0 V at a constant current density of 0.1 mA cm-2.\nFigure 2. Cyclic voltammogram of (1) ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF, and (2) PEDOT\/PVDF membrane electrodes in 1.0  M  NaNO3\/H2O  at  a\nscan rate of 20 mV s-1.\nThe typical charge-discharge  (Inset  (a)  in  Figure  3)  profiles  display  stable  charge-discharge  curves  during  cycling;\nindicative of stable electrochemical  performance  by  this  free-standing  ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF  membrane  electrode.  The\ndischarge capacity versus the cycle number for the above cell is shown in Fig.3. The first cycle of this electrode  exhibits  an\nenormous irreversible capacity, which can be attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte  interface  (SEI)  layer  on  the\nsurface of the electrodes [13]. However, a highly stable discharge capacity of 265 mAh g-1 is observed after 50 cycles.  This\nis  significantly  higher  than  the  value  obtained  previously  for  SWNT  paper  (173  mAh  g-1)  under  identical   working\nconditions [14]. This is attributed to the high accessible surface area of the aligned carbon  nanotubes  which,  coupled  with\nthe robust polymer layer, provides a mechanically stable array.  The  CNTs  in  ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF  electrode  keep  their\nnanostructured architecture, while the CNTs in SWNT paper prepared via vacuum filtration aggregate to  form  a  bundle  of\nCNTs and  thereby  lessen  the  surface  area  of  the  electrode.  This  is  reflected  in  the  stable  long-term  electrochemical\nperformance of these electrodes in a Li-ion battery. No degradation was observed over 50 charge-discharge cycles.\nAnother significant improvement is that this free-standing ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF electrode with excellent electronic  and\nmechanical properties does not  require  a  metal  substrate  (copper  foil)  as  is  normally  employed  to  support  the  active\nmaterials in a Lithium-ion battery [15]. For a typical anode (1 cm2) this equates to 14 mg of  copper  compared  to  2  mg  of\nPVDF, which still could be decreased by optimizing the process. This would significantly decrease the weight of  the  anode\nin a lithium-ion battery, or allow more active material per unit mass  to  increase  the  capacity  per  battery  unit.  The  other\nadvantage of this copper-free electrode is that it may contribute to the improvement of  the  long-term  battery  performance;\nwithout copper dissolution caused by impurities in the  electrolyte.  Due  to  the  chemical  and  electrochemical  stability  of\nPEDOT and PVDF, the impurities in the electrolyte would not cause the same problem  as  that  for  copper  foil  during  the\nlong-term battery performance. This may explain the stable electrochemical performance observed when used in a  Lithium-\nion battery.\n[pic]\nFigure 3. Discharge capacity vs. the cycle number of ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF electrode in a Li-ion testing cell under  a  constant  current\ndensity of 0.1 mA cm-2.\nOur preliminary results indicate that  this  novel  \u201cfree-standing\u201d  ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF  membrane  electrode,  which  is\nlightweight, flexible, highly conductive, and mechanically robust,  could  be  easily  fabricated  into  a  rechargeable  battery\nwithout using a metal  substrate  or  binder.  In  this  Li-ion  battery,  the  weight  of  the  electrode  is  reduced  significantly\ncompared with a conventional electrode made by coating a mixture containing an active material  onto  the  metal  substrate.\nThe results also show that the capacity of the ACNT\/PEDOT\/PVDF electrode is 50%  higher  than  that  observed  for  free-\nstanding SWNT paper. This study has important implications for the use  of  aligned  carbon  nanotube\/conductive  polymer\ncomposites as a new class of electrode materials in developing flexible rechargeable lithium-ion batteries  and  may  lead  to\nother applications of carbon nanotubes in flexible electronic devices. The scale-up production of  ACNT  for  increasing  the\npower of single-cell is under investigation.\nSupporting Information\nIn a typical experiment following production of the aligned CNTs on a quartz plate, PEDOT film was deposited  onto  the\nCNT array by chemical vapour phase polymerisation. A thin film of ferric p-toluenesulfonate (Fe(III)  tosylate)  was  coated\non the ACNT array using a spin coater (Laurell Tech. Co.) at a speed of  1000  rpm  for  1  min  from  a  10%  (w\/w)  Fe(III)\ntosylate solution in ethanol. The Fe(III) tosylate coated ACNT array was placed directly into an oven at 80\u00b0C  for  3  min  to\nquickly evaporate the ethanol,  thereby  forming  a  good  quality  continuous  Fe(III)  tosylate  film.  The  sample  was  then\nexposed to 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer vapour in the  vapour  phase  polymerization  (VPP)  chamber  at\n60\u00b0C [16].  After 30 min, the sample was  removed  from  the  chamber  and  a  blue  film  was  visible  on  the  quartz  plate\nindicating the formation of PEDOT. Following air-drying for 1 h,  the  PEDOT  coated  ACNT  array  was  washed  in  pure\nethanol to remove unreacted EDOT monomer as well as Fe ions. The PEDOT modified ACNT  array  was  then  dried  in  a\nfume-hood.\nWe thank the Australian Research Council for continued financial support.\n[1] Y. Yang, S. Huang, H. He, A.W.H. Mau, L. Dai, J.
