The superdense phase of the plasma sheet is found to be a common feature\nof high-speed-stream-driven storms, commencing before the onset of the storm and\npersisting for about 1 day into the storm. A separate phenomenon, the extra-hot phase of\nthe plasma sheet, commences at storm onset and persists for several days during the\nstorm. The superdense plasma sheet originates from the high-density compressed slow\nand fast solar wind of the corotating interaction region on the leading edge of the high-\nspeed stream. Tracking the motion of this dense plasma into and through the magneto-\nsphere, plasma transport times are estimated. Transport from the nightside of the dipole to\nthe dayside requires about 10h. The occurrences of both the superdense plasma sheet and\nthe extra-hot plasma sheet have broad implications for the physics of geomagnetic storms.\n& 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. Introduction\nThe superdense plasma sheet was first noticed in the\nanalysis of magnetotail and geosynchronous-orbit plasma\ndata (Borovsky et al., 1997). It was found that at times the\nEarth\u2019s plasma-sheet density was anomalously high and\nthat those \u2018\u2018superdense\u2019\u2019 intervals were statistically dis-\ntinct from the standard range of plasma-sheet densities. It\nwas later learned that the superdense plasma sheet has its\norigin in anomalously high-density solar wind (Borovsky\net al., 1998a), with the additional constraint that south-\nward IMF is necessary for the dense solar-wind plasma to\nenter the magnetosphere (Thomsen et al., 1998a).\nThe \u2018\u2018superdense\u2019\u2019 plasma sheet was defined in those\nearly studies as a hot plasma-sheet plasma, to be.

Denton).contrasted with later studies of the \u2018\u2018cool dense plasma\nsheet\u2019\u2019 which fills the outer magnetosphere during ex-\ntended periods of northward IMF (e.g. Fujimoto et al.,\n2000, 2002, 2005; Phan et al., 2000; Nishino et al., 2002)\nand then is subsequently transported into the inner\nmagnetosphere when geomagnetic activity commences\n(cf. Thomsen et al., 2003; Lavraud et al., 2005), particularly\nduring high-speed-stream-driven storms preceded by\ncalms (Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006; Lavraud et al., 2006).\nIn the superposed epoch studies of Denton and\nBorovsky (2008) the superdense plasma sheet is clearly\nseen during high-speed-stream-driven storms. Further,\nthe superposed-epoch studies show that an anomalously\nhot (\u2018\u2018extra-hot\u2019\u2019) plasma sheet is also a feature of high-\nspeed-stream-driven storms (Denton et al., 2006; Denton\nand Borovsky, 2008).\nIn Fig. 1 the superdense plasma sheet and the extra-hot\nplasma sheet associated with high-speed-stream-driven\nstorms can be seen. The plot is a superposition of\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 1. In the top panel, for 124 high-speed-stream-driven storms the superposed-epoch average of the nightside (21\u20133 LT) hot-ion density (black) and\nhot-electron density (grey) is plotted as a function of the time from onset of storm. In the bottom panel, for 124 high-speed-stream-driven storms the\nsuperposed-epoch average of the hot ion temperature (black) and hot-electron temperature (grey) is plotted as a function of the time from onset of storm.\nThe superdense phase of the plasma sheet is indicated in the top panel and the extra-hot phase of the plasma sheet is indicated in the bottom panel.\nM.H.

In the top panel\nof Fig. 1 the hot-ion (0.1\u201345keV: black line) and hot-\nelectron (0.03\u201345keV: grey line) densities measured at\ngeosynchronous orbit in the nightside sector from 21 to\n3 LT are plotted. The superposed average (mean) density\nclearly shows a superdense phase that starts prior to\nstorm onset and lasts about 1 day. In the bottom panel of\nFig. 1 the ion (black) and electron (grey) temperatures are\nplotted in the 21\u20133 LT nightside sector. The superposed\naverage temperature shows an extra-hot plasma sheet\nthat has a rapid onset at about storm onset and that\npersists for several days.\nIn this report the superdense plasma sheet during\nhigh-speed-stream-driven storms is studied in detail\nusing superposed-epoch data analysis of solar-wind and\nmagnetospheric measurements. It will be shown that thesuperdense plasma sheet is a common occurrence during\nthe buildup and early phase of a high-speed-stream\ndriven storm. It is associated with the passage of a\ncorotating interaction region (CIR) at the leading edge of a\nhigh-speed stream, with the extra-dense magnetospheric\nplasma having its origin in the high density of the\ncompressed solar-wind plasma of the CIR. It will be\nshown that the extra-hot plasma sheet commences when\nthe storm commences and persists for days while the\nstorm ensues. Timing the onset of the superdense plasma\nsheet at various locations in the magnetosphere will\nprovide measurements of magnetospheric-convection\ntimescales.\nThe superdense plasma sheet can be important for\ngeomagnetic-storm physics. Its high density provides\nextra thermal energy with which to drive plasma waves\nin the magnetosphere that may be important for radia-\ntion-belt physics (Horne and Thorne, 1998; Summers and\nThorne, 2003; Meredith et al., 2003).

And its high thermal-\nenergy content might lead to stronger proton and diffuse-\nelectron aurora, altering the properties of the stormtime\nionosphere. The extra-hot plasma sheet is important for\nspacecraft charging during high-speed-stream-driven\nstorms (Denton et al., 2006).\nThis manuscript is organized as follows. In Section 2\nthe event selection and data-analysis techniques are\nexplained. In Section 3 the properties of the superdense\nplasma sheet are explored and the relation of the super-\ndense plasma sheet to the properties of the solar wind is\nexamined. Section 4 contains observations of the super-\ndense plasma sheet used to measure mass-transport\ntimescales within the magnetosphere. In Section 5 the\nonset of the extra-hot plasma sheet is explored in relation\nto the chronology of the solar wind and the geomagnetic\nstorm. In Section 6 issues associated with the arrival of the\nsuperdense plasma sheet and the arrival of the extra-hot\nplasma sheet are discussed. The findings of this study are\nsummarized in Section 7.\n2. Data sets and event selection\nAs noted by Borovsky et al. (1998b): \u2018\u2018in the near-Earth\nmagnetotail, the gradient- and curvature-drift effects\ndiffer for plasma-sheet ions and plasma-sheet electrons\ny as a result, the plasma sheet of the tail separates into\nan ion plasma sheet and an electron plasma sheet near the\nEarth, and the two plasma sheets have very different\nevolutions\u2019\u2019. At geosynchronous orbit, the ion and electron\nplasma sheets are not exactly co-located and they need\nnot have the same number density. At geosynchronous\norbit there are low-density populations of cool ions and\nelectrons that can ensure charge neutrality.\nThe ion and electron plasma sheets in the dipolar\nmagnetosphere are analysed using the multispacecraft\nMPA instruments (Bame et al., 1993), located on-board Los\nAlamos National Laboratory satellites in circular geosyn-\nchronous orbits (6.6RE) at the geographic equator. The\nMPA instruments measure three-dimensional ion and\nelectron distribution functions every 86 s over the energy\nrange \u00021eV to 45keV. Each distribution function is\nacquired in 10 s. Note that the ion temperatures measured\nby MPA are underestimates, owing to the fact that the ion\nplasma sheet contains a significant amount of ions withTable 1\nTypical chronology of a recurring-high-speed-stream cycle and the resulting ge\nThe solar wind at earth Stage of geomagnetic activity\nRarefaction\nSlow wind Calm occurs \u000270% of time\nCIR starts Calm ends\nCompressed slow wind (westward flow)\nSector reversal in compressed slow wind Geomagnetic activity rises\nCompressed slow wind with southward IMF Storm onset\nStream interface (flow reversal)\nCompressed fast wind (eastward flow) Storm levels\nCIR ends\nFast wind Activity slowly declinesenergies above the 45-keV limit of the detector (Borovsky\net al., 1998c). The 1-min OMNI database (King and\nPapitashvili, 2005) is used to obtain the properties of the\nsolar-wind plasma and the IMF at the magnetopause.\nRecurring high-speed-streams make excellent candi-\ndates for superposed-epoch studies (e.g. McPherron and\nWeygand, 2006; Denton et al., 2006; Denton and\nBorovsky, 2008; Longden et al., 2008) because there is a\nrepeating sequence of solar-wind types that pass the Earth\n(cf. Fig. 1 of Richardson et al., 1996): fast wind, rarefaction,\nslow wind, onset of CIR, compressed slow wind (westward\nflow), sector reversal within the compressed slow wind,\nstream interface, compressed fast wind (eastward flow),\nend of CIR, and again fast wind, rarefaction, etc. This\nrepeating sequence is listed in the first column of Table 1.\nThe collection of high-speed-stream-driven storms\nused for the present study (1993\u20132006) is the set of 124\nrecurring storms used for the Denton and Borovsky (2008)\nsuperposed epoch study. The storms were found by using\nthe McPherron list of solar-wind stream interfaces (Robert\nMcPherron, private communication, 2007; McPherron and\nWeygand, 2006), with additions based on the same\ncriteria, and then examining temporal plots of the Kp\nindex to identify storms following the stream interfaces.\nThe Kp index is used in preference to the Dst index since\nhigh-speed-stream-driven storms typically have poor Dst\nsignatures (e.g. Kavanagh and Denton, 2007) Then, for\neach storm in the collection, the onset time of convection\n(storm onset) is determined as the first drop in Midnight\nBoundary Index (MBI) (Gussenhoven and Madden, 1990)\nof40.51 latitude following the stream interface. MBI is an\nexcellent indicator of magnetospheric convection, as is Kp\n(Thomsen, 2004), but MBI has higher time resolution than\nthe 3-h Kp index. The storm onset times were determined\nto about 30-min accuracy.\n3. Properties of the superdense plasma sheet and\nrelation to the solar wind\nIn Fig. 2 superposed measurements from the magneto-\nsphere and the solar wind are shown. The zero epoch of\nthe plots is convection reaching storm levels. In the top\npanel of Fig. 2 the superposed average of the solar-wind\nspeed is shown.

Denton, J.E. Borovsky \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 1045\u201310581048Between the slow wind and the fast wind is a CIR where\nthe fast wind overtaking the slow wind forms a broad\nregion of compressed plasma. The CIR is a region of\nenhanced pressure and density that spans the compressedslow wind, the compressed fast wind, and the stream\ninterface in between the two.\nIn the second panel of Fig. 2 the y-component (ecliptic)\nof the solar-wind flow velocity is plotted. Owing to the\ncollision of fast and slow wind along an oblique front,\nthere are east\u2013west perturbations to the solar-wind radial\noutflow in the CIR. The compressed slow wind is\ncharacterized by a westward flow with density, tempera-\nture, and magnetic-field strength elevated above the\npreceding slow solar wind. The stream interface is marked\nby a reversal in the east\u2013west flow direction: it is the\ninterface between compressed slow wind and compressed\nfast wind. Following the stream interface the compressed\nfast wind is characterized by an eastward flow with a\ntemperature and field strength further elevated from the\ncompressed-slow-wind values but a density that is\ndecreased from the compressed-slow-wind values. In the\nsuperposed-epoch-averaged data of the second panel\nof Fig. 2, the stream interface occurs at an epoch time\nt \u00bc +3h.\nIn the third panel of Fig. 2 the superposed-epoch\naverage of the solar-wind density is plotted as the black\ncurve for the 124 storms. Note the enhanced density of the\nsolar wind before and after the stream interface. This\nenhanced density is associated with the compression of\nthe solar-wind plasma in the CIR; the earlier portion of the\ndense solar wind is compressed slow wind and the latter\nportion is compressed fast wind. A Gaussian fit to the\nenhanced density is plotted as the grey curve in the third\npanel (see Eq. (1), Section 4 for details of the fit). The full\nwidth of the Gaussian fit is 30h. This width is consistent\nwith the width of the high-density solar-wind perturba-\ntions seen in the superposed-epoch study of McPherron\nand Weygand (2006), where the zero time of that\nsuperposition was chosen to be the solar-wind stream\ninterface.\nIn the fourth panel of Fig. 2 the superposed average of\nthe IMF component Bz (GSM) is plotted. Prior to the storm\nBz is predominantly northward (positive) and during the\nstorm Bz is predominantly southward (negative). A sector\nreversal typically lies several hours upstream of the\nstream interface (Wilcox and Ness, 1967). In the fourth\npanel, the superposed average would place the sector\nreversal at t \u00bc \u00034h. Note that the Russell\u2013McPherron\neffect prior to the sector reversal tends to produce a calm\nbefore the storm (Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006), if there\nis going to be a storm.\nIn the fifth panel of Fig. 2 the superposed average of\nthe Kp index is plotted. Prior to the storm onset theFig. 2. For a superposition of measurements from 124 high-speed-\nstream-driven storms, several quantities are plotted as a function of the\ntime since storm onset.

The ion density\nis plotted as the solid black curve and the electron density\nis plotted as the solid grey curve. Prior to the storm the ion\nand electron densities are at normal levels; during the\nfirst day of the storm they are elevated to higher levels;\nand then later in the storm (the storms persist for several\ndays; Denton and Borovsky, 2008) the plasma-sheet\ndensity returns to normal levels. Gaussian fits to the\nenhanced plasma sheet density are shown as the black\n(ion) and grey (electron) dashed curves in the bottom\npanel of Fig. 2. The full widths of the Gaussian fits are\n32.6 h for the superdense ion plasma sheet and 26.2 h for\nthe superdense electron plasma sheet. These values are\nindicators of the duration of a superdense plasma sheet in\nthe nightside dipolar magnetosphere.\nA comparison of the third and sixth panels of Fig. 2\ndemonstrates the relationship between the high-density\nsolar wind and the superdense plasma sheet.

The top panel plots the hot-ion density\nin the 20\u20133 LT sector of geosynchronous orbit (black solid\ncurve) and in the 9\u201315 LT sector (grey solid curve);\nGaussian fits to these densities are shown as the dashed\ncurves.

The superdense plasma sheet is particularly\nweak for electrons on the dayside (see also Section 3.2 of\nBorovsky et al., 1998b): plasma-sheet electrons are known\nto suffer strong losses in moving from the nightside to the\ndayside (Thomsen et al., 1998b).LT) is compared with the superdense ion plasma sheet on the nightside\nside (9\u201315 LT) is compared with the superdense electron plasma sheet on\nhigh-speed-stream-driven storms.

Transport times in the magnetosphere\nTo study mass-transport timescales within the magne-\ntosphere, the movement of the superdense plasma sheet\nfrom the nightside to the dayside is timed in the\nsuperposed-epoch averages. Timing is analysed separately\nfor the ion plasma sheet and the electron plasma sheet.\nTwo methods are used. The first method looks at the\ntiming at various locations of a fast rise in the density of\nthe plasma sheet (similar to the single event analysed in\nBorovsky et al., 1998b mid-points of the fast rises at\nvarious local times are used to determine the timing).

These fast rises in the\nnumber density represent the onset of the superdense\nplasma sheet at the various local-time locations around\nthe Earth. Each curve is the average of a local-time sector\nthat is 3 h wide. The various curves are labelled according\nto (a) the central local time of the 3-h-wide sector and\n(b) the mean epoch time of the fast rise. Note that the\nvertical and horizontal scales are the same for the two\nplots in Fig. 4. Two clear local-time trends can be seen in\nboth plots in Fig. 4: (1) the superdense plasma sheet is less\ndense on the dayside than it is on the nightside and (2) the\nsuperdense plasma sheet appears first on the nightside\nand then later on the dayside. Measuring the fast rise in\nthe solar-wind density at Earth (not shown) yields a time\nof \u00036.5 h. In the superposed averages, there is no rise in\nthe hot-electron density seen in the 12 and 15 LT sectors.\nEarly in high-speed-stream-driven storms these two local-\ntime sectors tend to be filled with broad plasmaspheric\ndrainage plumes (Borovsky and Denton, 2008; Denton\nand Borovsky, 2008) and it is known that the electron\nplasma sheet and the plasmasphere rarely interpenetrate\n(cf. Thomsen et al., 1998b).Fig. 5.

Each temporal value marked in the\nsketch is the delay in time at which the superdense\nplasma sheet arrives at that location relative to the time it\narrived at local midnight. The temporal values marked in\npanel a of Fig. 5 are obtained from the top panel of Fig. 4\nand the values marked in panel b of Fig. 5 are obtained\nfrom the bottom panel of Fig. 4.\nIn panel a and b of Fig. 6 the delay in rise times from\nthe fast rise in the solar-wind density at Earth are shown.\n(The rise in the solar-wind density occurred at epoch time\nt \u00bc \u00036.5 h.) Panel a pertains to the arrival of the super-\ndense ion plasma sheet relative to the rise in solar-wind\ndensity and panel b pertains to the arrival of the super-\ndense electron plasma sheet relative to the rise in the\nsolar-wind density.\nThe second method used to look at the timing of\nplasma transport is to compare Gaussian fits to the\nenhanced density of the plasma sheet at various local\ntimes and to the solar-wind density.

The constants of\ninterest are C2 (the amplitude of the density perturbation),\nC3 (the epoch time upon which the Gaussian fit is\ncentred), and C4 (the halfwidth of the Gaussian). C1 is\nthe average density of the plasma sheet before and after\nthe superdense plasma sheet and the term C5t in\nexpression (1) allows for a change in plasma sheet density\nbefore and after the superdense phase. The fits are\nperformed over the time range from \u000336 to +48h. The\nrelevant parameters for Gaussian fits to the solar wind\ndensity, to the hot-ion density at various local times at\ngeosynchronous orbit, and to the hot-electron density at\nvarious local times at geosynchronous orbit (where\navailable) are collected into Table 2.\nIn panels c and d of Figs. 5 and 6 the centre times of the\nGaussian fits are used to examine the transport times\nwithin (Fig. 5) and into and through (Fig. 6) the magneto-\nsphere. In Fig. 5 the times in the sketches are the centre\ntimes of the various Gaussian fits relative to the centre\ntime at local midnight and in Fig. 6 the times in the\nsketches are the centre times of the various Gaussian fits\nrelative to the centre time of the Gaussian fit to the solar-\nwind density.\nComparing panels a and b of Fig. 5 with panels c and d\nof Fig. 5, one can see that the two methods (tracking thefast rise in density and comparing the centres of the\nGaussian fits) yield similar values for the plasma-trans-\nport times around the Earth. The hot ions and hot\nelectrons appear first at midnight and then take 10h or\nless to reach the dayside. Electron transport to the dayside\nis chiefly along the dawnside. Ion transport to the dayside\nappears to be via both the dawn and dusk sectors. This\ndawn and dusk ion transport is consistent with the\nfindings of Denton and Borovsky (2008) that ion flows\nduring high-speed-stream-driven storms are sunward at\nabout 6km\/s in both the dawn and dusk sectors of\ngeosynchronous orbit. At 6 km\/s, transport from midnight\nto noon along the circle of geosynchronous orbit would\nrequire (1.31\u0004105 km)\/(6 km\/s) \u00026h. This 6-h estimate is\nconsistent with the values found in the present study.\nNote that the transport-time values arrived at in the\npresent study are considerably larger than values esti-\nmated using traces of (Volland-Stern) ionospheric-con-\nvection patterns (Borovsky et al., 1998c), which yielded\n4.2 h or less from transport from the magnetotail to the\ndayside neutral line, meaning less than 4.2h for transport\nfrom midnight geosynchronous to noon geosynchronous.\nComparing panels a and b of Fig. 6 with panels c and d\nof Fig. 6, one finds that the fast-rise method obtains a\nquicker estimate of the timescale for solar wind plasma to\nenter the magnetosphere and reach midnight (about 2h)\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nFig. 7.

The\nauthors feel that the fast-rise method is a more direct\nmethod for measuring plasma-transport times.\nIn Fig. 7 a sketch summarizing transport times from\nBorovsky et al. (1998b) is presented. Those transport times\nwere obtained by cross correlating solar-wind density\nwith magnetospheric hot-ion density, varying the time lag\nbetween the solar-wind measurements and the magneto-\nspheric measurements, and taking the time lag that yields\nthe largest linear correlation coefficient to be the trans-\nport time. The Borovsky et al. (1998a) data sets had a\nmixture of non-storm and storm times and a mixture of\nordinary plasma sheet and superdense plasma sheet, with\nthe predominance of data for non-storm and ordinary\nplasma sheet. As can be seen by comparing Fig. 7 with\nFig. 6, the transport-time values of Borovsky et al. (1998a),\nparticular those for solar wind to midnight geosynchro-\nnous and from solar wind to noon geosynchronous, are in\nthe middle of the spread in values obtained in the present\nstudy.\nThe timing of the onset and end of the superdense\nplasma sheet relative to the chronologies of the solar wind\nand the storm is summarized in the two panels of Fig. 8.\nThe top panel pertains to the results of the fast-rise\nmethod and the bottom panel pertains to the results of\nthe Gaussian-fit method.

And as demonstrated in the bottom panel of\nFig. 1, the ion and electron plasma sheets have an extra-\nhot phase that lasts for several days during a high-speed-\nstream-driven storm.\nThe extra-hot electron plasma sheet is the cause of the\nhigh levels of spacecraft charging measured during high-\nspeed-stream-driven storms (Borovsky et al., 1998b;\nDenton et al., 2006). Note that the extra-hot ion plasma\nsheet provides a poor fuel for the ring current; gradient-\nand curvature-drift effects prevent the extra-hot ions from\nconvecting deep into the dipole where their pressure can\nbe amplified (e.g. Ebihara and Ejiri, 2000; Liemohn et al.,\n2001; Kozyra and Liemohn, 2003). The extra-hot nature of\nthe plasma sheet probably contributes to the fact that\nhigh-speed-stream-driven storms tend to have poor Dst\nsignatures (Borovsky and Denton, 2006; see also McPher-\nron and Weygand, 2006; Tsurutani et al., 2006).\nIn Fig. 9 the rapid transition to the extra-hot phase is\nexamined in the various 3-h-wide local-time sectors. The\ntop panel of Fig. 9 plots the transitions for the ion plasma\nsheet and the bottom panel plots the transitions for the\nelectron plasma sheet. The various curves are labelled\naccording to (a) the central local time of the sector and\n(b) the mean epoch time of the ramp. The horizontal axes\nare the same for the two plots, but the vertical axes differ:\nthe ions are much hotter (cf. Fig. 1). Both panels show the\ntrend that the extra-hot plasma sheet first appears on the\nnightside and then later appears on the dayside. As can be\nseen by comparing the two panels of Fig. 9, the transition\nto the extra-hot plasma sheet is globally more rapid for the\nelectrons, with only about a 2.5-h spread in arrival time for\nall local times. The transition to the extra-hot phase for the\nions takes about 7.5h from nightside to dayside.\nThe top panel of Fig. 8 demonstrates that the arrival of\nthe extra-hot phase is not simultaneous with the arrival of\nthe superdense phase. Here, the first appearance of the\nextra-hot ion plasma sheet (red) and extra-hot electron\nplasma sheet (purple) are plotted along with the first\nappearance of the superdense ion plasma sheet (green)\nand the superdense electron plasma sheet (brown), all as\nfunctions of local time. At the various local times, the\narrival times of superdense and the arrival times of extra-\nhot are not simultaneous. The values for these four curves\nin Fig. 8 come from Figs. 4 and 9. As can be seen, on the\nnightside of the Earth the superdense phase precedes the\nextra-hot phase. Note also that the arrival times of ion and\nelectron superdense are not simultaneous (see also\nBorovsky et al., 1997) and that the arrival times of ion\nand electron extra-hot are not simultaneous.\n6. Discussion\nIn this section, the timing of the onset of the superdense\nplasma sheet (Section 6.1) and the timing of the onset of the\nextra-hot plasma sheet (Section 6.2) are discussed.\n6.1. On the entry of superdense plasma into the\nmagnetosphere\nIn the analysis of the superposed-epoch averaged solar-\nwind and magnetospheric data using rise-time and Gaus-sian-fit methods, the transport-time values from the solar\nwind to geosynchronous midnight vary considerably, from\n2 to 8.5h (see Fig. 6). The Borovsky et al. (1998a) study,\nusing cross-correlation methods, obtained 4h for the solar\nwind to geosynchronous midnight transport (see Fig. 7).\nThese transport times represent the time lag between a\nchange in the solar-wind density and a change in the\nmagnetospheric (midnight) density. If another factor acts to\ncontrol the entry of solar-wind plasma into the magneto-\nsphere (such as whether or not the IMF is southward) then\na simple density of the solar wind comparison with the\ndensity in the magnetosphere is insufficient to measure the\ntransport time. A more-sophisticated analysis in future\nlooking at solar-wind density, magnetospheric density, and\nthe IMF should be performed to investigate the regulation\nand the transport times.\n6.2. On the rapid transition to the extra-hot plasma sheet\nOne might guess that the rapid transition to the extra-\nhot plasma sheet might be associated with a slow-solar-\nwind to fast-solar-wind transition at perhaps the stream\ninterface. This simple association is not the case. As can be\nseen in Fig. 8, the rapid transition to extra-hot plasma\nsheet occurs in the magnetosphere prior to the arrival of\nthe stream interface, at least as seen in superposed-epoch\naverages. The arrival of the extra-hot plasma sheet is more\nassociated with the onset of storm levels of magneto-\nspheric convection. At this time (epoch time \u00bc 0h) the\nsolar-wind velocity is still quite low (see top panel of\nFig. 2). The extra-hot phase persists as the solar-wind\nvelocity increases and persists for days as the high-speed\nstream continues to drive activity. To ensure that the\narrival of the extra-hot plasma sheet is indeed prior to the\npassage of the stream interface a future study of the extra-\nhot plasma sheet in high-speed-stream-driven storms\nshould be performed with the zero of superposed epoch\nchosen to the solar-wind stream interface.\n7. Summary\nIn this report the superdense plasma sheet and the\nextra-hot plasma sheet were studied during high-speed-\nstream-driven storms using a superposed-epoch analysis\nof solar wind and magnetospheric measurements. The\nbasic findings of this study are the following:(1) The onset of the superdense plasma sheet in the\nmagnetosphere is prior to storm onset. The superdense\nplasma sheet first appears about the time of passage\nof the sector reversal.(2) The superdense plasma sheet arrives on the nightside\nfirst, later at dawn and dusk, and finally it arrives on the\ndayside. The transport of the ion plasma sheet from\nmidnight to the dayside appears to be via both the\ndawn and dusk sectors; the transport of the electron\nplasma sheet from midnight to the dayside appears\nto be via the dawn sector.(3) The superdense ion plasma sheet and the superdense\nelectron plasma sheet do not commence simultaneously.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nM.H. Denton, J.E. Borovsky \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 1045\u20131058 1057At some local times the superdense ions arrive first, at\nother local times the superdense electrons arrive first.(4) The superdense plasma sheet lasts for about a day and a\nhalf. The superdense plasma sheet is a feature of the\nearly phase of a high-speed-stream-driven storm.(5) The origin of the superdense plasma sheet appears to be\nthe compressed slow and fast wind of the CIR. The onset\nand termination of the superdense plasma sheet in the\nmagnetosphere both lag the onset and termination of\nthe high-density plasma of the solar wind.(6) The extra-hot plasma sheet commences approximately\nat storm onset. This commencement is prior to the\npassage of the stream interface, which is the nominal\ninterface between slow and fast wind. Hence the\nextra-hot plasma sheet arrives prior to what is\ncommonly defined as fast wind.(7) The extra-hot ion plasma sheet and the extra-hot\nelectron plasma sheet do not commence simulta-\nneously. At some local times the extra-hot ions arrive\nfirst, at other local times the extra-hot electrons\narrive first.(8) The extra-hot plasma sheet lasts for several days during\na high-speed-stream-driven storm. The extra-hot\nphase persists, on average, for at least 4 days after\nthe onset of each storm.(9) Measured plasma-transport timescales in the mag-\nnetosphere are 7\u201310h for plasma to travel from the\nnightside to the dayside. These transport times agree\napproximately with plasma flow velocity measure-\nments at geosynchronous orbit. These transport\ntimes are considerably longer than transport times\ninferred from an ionospheric convection model.(10) Values obtained for the timescale for solar-wind\nplasma to enter the magnetosphere and reach geosyn-\nchronous orbit vary from 2 to 8.5h. Different methods\non the hot ions and hot electrons yield different values.\nThe timescale is ambiguous in this study.A summary of the chronology of the storm, the super-\ndense plasma sheet, and the extra-hot plasma sheet is the\nfollowing (see also Table 1). Storm onset occurs in the\ncompressed slow wind a few hours after the sector\nreversal passes the Earth and prior to the passage of the\nstream interface. The storm then persists for days. The\nsuperdense plasma sheet appears in the magnetosphere\nprior to storm onset and persists for about 1 day into the\nstorm. The extra-hot plasma sheet commences with storm\nonset and persists for several days during the storm.\nThe superdense plasma sheet may be important for\ndriving magnetospheric plasma waves, for distorting the\nouter dipole, and for producing strong proton and diffuse-\nelectron aurora. The extra-hot plasma sheet is important\nfor high levels of spacecraft charging and may be\nimportant for limiting the Dst perturbation of high-\nspeed-stream-driven storms.Acknowledgements\nWe wish to thank Bob McPherron for providing the\ninitial list of stream interfaces and Michelle Thomsen forhelpful discussions.
