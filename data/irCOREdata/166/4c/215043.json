We apply this framework to explain an empirical puzzle: why two arch-rival states \u2014 Austria and Prussia in the second half of the 18th century \u2014 succeeded in cooperating in some cases but failed in others.<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>\n        Sage Publications Ltd<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>\n        2010-03<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:language>\n        en<\/dc:language><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/28582\/1\/Which%20synthesis%20%28LSERO%29.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n          Andreatta, Filippo and Koenig-Archibugi, Mathias  (2010) Which synthesis?: strategies of theoretical integration and the neorealist-neoliberal debate.

Strategies of Theoretical Integration and the Neorealist-Neoliberal \nDebate \n \n \n \nFilippo Andreatta \n \nMathias Koenig-Archibugi \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n \nIntroduction \nOver the past ten years the promises and problems of theoretical synthesis have received \nincreasing attention in the political science community. For instance, in his 1999 Presidential \nAddress to the International Studies Association, Michael Brecher remarked that \u201cthe paucity of \nserious attempts at synthesis, or at least complementarity, among contending paradigms is an \nindicator of deep malaise.\u201d (Brecher, 1999: 235). A few years later another ISA President, Steve \nSmith, expressed a different view on the feasibility and desirability of synthesis:  \u201cNo research \nagenda can lead to synthesis, simply because different approaches see different worlds\u201d. (Smith, \n2003: 143). Considering contrasting statements such as these, it might seem that, paradoxically, \nthe issue of whether and how to pursue theoretical integration has given rise to an additional \ncleavage within an already divided discipline. This conclusion, however, would be unduly \nnegative. Many, perhaps most, political scientists would probably subscribe to the position that \nsynthesis may be desirable in principle, but its benefits and costs need to be assessed carefully \nand case by case. \n What seems clear is that there is no universally applicable blueprint for synthesizing \ntheoretical approaches. In a landmark analysis of the problem, Jupille, Caporaso and Checkel \n(2003) identified four \u201cmodels of theoretical dialogue\u201d: competitive testing; additive theory \nbased on complementary domains of application; sequencing of theories; and subsumption. \nWhile competitive testing cannot be considered a form of synthesis, determining domains of \n 3 \napplication and sequencing are two synthetic strategies based on complementarity, and \nsubsumption is a form of synthesis that interprets one theory as a special case of another. \n Theories are not always commensurable and in such cases attempts at integrating them \nare unlikely to improve understanding of the phenomena they refer to. In many cases, however, \ntheoretical constructs are sufficiently akin to justify attempts at integration. Given that none of \nthe models of dialogue identified by Jupille, Caporaso and Checkel is intrinsically preferable to \nthe others, scholars interested in integrating theories are left with the task of determining which \nmodel may be more appropriate in the specific circumstances of the research question. But the \nabsence of a set of criteria aimed at clarifying which model of dialogue is best suited to address \nwhich questions may have the undesirable effect of transforming a sterile clash of monolithic \ntheories into an inconclusive discussion over alternative integrative approaches.  \n This article aims at contributing to the development of criteria for synthetic endeavours \nand to show how those criteria can be applied to a specific theoretical debate and empirical \npuzzle. We focus on the choice between two strategies: identifying complementary domains of \napplication and showing how one theory subsumes another. In line with the plea of Jupille, \nCaporaso and Checkel, the argument is not developed at the level of meta-theoretical first \nprinciples, but in relation to specific hypotheses and empirical questions.  \n The standards for assessing the quality of synthetic attempts should not be fundamentally \ndifferent from those employed for evaluating theories. Jupille, Caporaso and Checkel (2003) \nprovide a useful (and not necessarily exhaustive) list of standards: logical coherence, parsimony, \nscope, robustness, falsifiability and empirical fit. In this article we focus on two standards, \ntheoretical parsimony and empirical fit. The criterion of parsimony entails that subsumption is an \nappropriate strategy for synthesis if, all else being equal, it can be shown that a theory generates \n 4 \nthe same observable implications of another theory while involving fewer explanatory factors or \nparameters (Occam\u2019s razor). The criterion of empirical fit entails that subsumption is appropriate \nwhen, for any given phenomenon, the subsuming theory accounts for all its empirical instances \nthat can be explained by the subsumed theory, plus additional facts.  Few empirical research \ndesigns can hope to capture all empirical instances of the phenomena of interest, and this raises \nthe problem of the falsifiability of any attempt at synthesis. We address this problem by \nproposing a pragmatic variant of the empirical fit criterion: the subsuming theory should be able \nto account for those instances that are most likely to be explained by the subsumed theory. The \nfocus on most likely instances allows researchers to employ a case study approach to questions \nof theory synthesis (George and Bennett, 2005: 253). \n We apply these criteria to a major debate in international relations theory, which concerns \nthe relationship between the neorealist and the neoliberal approaches to international \ncooperation.1 This debate is not only of considerable intrinsic interest but also highly relevant to \nthe question of synthesis, since at various stages of the debate key participants espoused one or \nthe other of the four models of dialogue identified by Jupille, Caporaso and Checkel: competitive \ntesting, complementarity based on different domains of application, subsumption of \nneoliberalism under neorealism, and subsumption of neorealism under neoliberalism. In this \narticle we apply the criterion of parsimony to the relationship between the two perspectives and \nconclude that subsumption of one theory \u2013 neorealism \u2013 under the other is theoretically more \nsatisfying with respect to the question of cooperation than a synthesis based on different domains \nof application, which has been advocated by various authors. This is because the core variable \nidentified by neoliberals \u2013 the fear of cheating in an anarchic international environment \u2013 \naccounts not only for the cooperation problems faced by absolute-gains seekers, but also those \n 5 \nplaguing states that, as neorealists suggest, are concerned about relative gains and thus interested \nin reducing or eliminating them through compensation agreements. \n Since the theoretical argument of this article identifies neorealism as the subsumed \ntheory, the application of the most-likely empirical fit criterion requires the selection of an \nempirical context in which the explanatory power of neorealism is particularly strong. For \nreasons explained below, international politics in eighteenth-century Europe fits neorealist \nassumption particularly well. To give additional credibility to the test, we will focus on two \nstates, Austria and Prussia, whose concern for their respective power positions was intense even \nby eighteenth-century standards. The question that we ask is: what explains the pattern of \nsuccessful and failed attempts at cooperation between Austria and Prussia between 1763 and \n1795? More specifically, why did those powers manage to divide up Poland, but not a number of \ncoveted territories in Germany? Our findings are particularly revealing because the relationship \nbetween states aiming for territorial aggrandizement and intensely concerned with relative gains \nis a most likely case for the neorealist approach. \n The article proceeds as follows. The next section provides a brief summary of the debate \nbetween neoliberals and neorealists on the implications of relative gains for international \ncooperation and shows how key protagonists saw the relationship between the approaches in \nterms of subsumption or complementarity. The following section develops a theoretical \nargument for subsumption that provides a parsimonious way of integrating the two approaches. \nThe last section shows how the proposed integrative framework can account for the pattern of \nsuccess and failure of cooperation attempts by Austria and Prussia in the second half of the \neighteenth century.  \n  \n 6 \nComplementarity and subsumption in the neoliberalism-neorealism debate \nNeoliberalism \u2013 also knows as neoliberal institutionalism, or rational institutional theory \u2013 is \ninterested in explaining when and how states succeed in cooperating for mutual advantage \ndespite international anarchy, i.e. the absence of a supranational government capable to enforce \nagreements in the international sphere (Keohane, 1984; Oye, 1986; Martin, 1992; Wallander, \n1999).  If anarchy means that punishment for defection is uncertain, the main problem for \ncooperation is that states may be tempted to exploit the others, even if this may result in \nsuboptimal outcomes. According to neoliberals, cooperation for mutual advantage is easier if \ncertain conditions are met: notably, if the benefits of defection are not much greater than the \nbenefits of cooperation, if actors expect to continue their interaction in the future and if the task \nof negotiating an agreement and sanctioning defectors is not too difficult as a result of large \nnumbers of actors and information deficits.  Neoliberals argue also that by manipulating the \ncontext of interaction \u2013 most notably by creating institutions \u2013 states may improve the \ninformational environment and reduce the opportunities for cheating and free riding. \nRealists responded to the neoliberal analysis by arguing that it underestimates the range of \nproblems inhibiting cooperation. They point out that anarchy does not simply mean the absence \nof  a central authority able to enforce agreements, but also the absence of an ultimate protector of \nstates, which are therefore compelled to provide for their own security and, ultimately, for their \nown survival. Since a state's ability to threaten the interests of another depends on their \nrespective power capabilities, states cannot afford to maximize their gains in absolute terms if \nthis decreases their relative power. As Kenneth Waltz argued (1979: 105),  \n\u201cwhen faced with the possibility of cooperating for mutual gain, states that feel \ninsecure must ask how the gain will be divided. They are compelled to ask not \u2018Will both \n 7 \nof us gain?\u2019 but \u2018Who will gain more?\u2019 If an expected gain is to be divided, say, in the \nratio of two to one, one state may use its disproportionate gain to implement a policy \nintended to damage or destroy the other. Even the prospect of large absolute gains for \nboth parties does not elicit their cooperation as long as each fears how the other will use \nits increased capabilities\u201d. \nJoseph Grieco (1988, 1990, 1993) elaborated this criticism and pointed out that international \ncooperation is difficult because states are not \u201crational egoists\u201d, as neoliberals assume, but \n\u201cdefensive positionalists\u201d. Defensive positionalists aim to prevent a relative strengthening of \nother states even if this requires them to forego absolute gains, because of the risk that today's \ncooperation partner might become tomorrow's adversary. Including relative gains concerns in the \ncalculation of states can substantially modify their attitude to cooperation. This means that, for \nrealists, not one but \u201c[t]wo factors inhibit cooperation: considerations about relative gains and \nconcern about cheating\u201d (Mearsheimer, 2001: 51-52, emphasis added). International cooperation \nis therefore more difficult than neoliberals expect, because \u201cstates must solve both the cheating \nand the relative gains problem in order to achieve cooperation\u201d (Grieco, 1993: 303, emphasis in \nthe original). To be sure, neorealists do not deny that uncertainty about whether the counterpart \nwill reciprocate cooperation may be an important factor in states\u2019 calculations. But they stress \nthat states will often be reluctant to cooperate even if they could be certain that the counterpart \nwill cooperate and that they will gain as a result. \u201cTrust\u201d does not solve the distributional \nconflict. To the extent that states have conflicting interests regarding the distribution of gains, \ncooperation is not necessarily Pareto-improving, as it would be if the key problem was how to \navoid defection.2      \n 8 \nSubsequent contributions to the debate highlighted a number of interesting implications. \nSnidal (1991) showed that the impact relative gains concerns on cooperation diminishes with \nincreasing numbers of states. Powell (1991) urged focus on constraints facing states, rather than \ntheir preferences, and showed that even states assumed to be absolute-gains maximizers will \navoid cooperating in an international context in which the cost of using force is sufficiently low. \nMorrow (1997) noted that states can raise military spending to compensate for increased security \nthreats, and thus relative gain concerns and security externalities may block peacetime trade \namong rivals only in unusual circumstances. Grundig (2006) noted that relative gain concerns \nmake cooperation more difficult in the provision of non-excludable goods, such as addressing \nclimate change, than in the domain of excludable goods, such as trade. Rousseau (2002) \nprovided experimental evidence that the importance attached to relative as opposed to absolute \ngains in international relations varies considerably across individuals and is systematically \naffected by factors such as the identity of the opponent.3 \nIn light of this debate, how can, and should, the relationship between neoliberalism and \nneorealism be conceived? In his in-depth analysis of that relationship, Thies notes that \n\u201cneoliberalism has been presented as virtually identical to neorealism and as its opposite.\u201d (Thies \n2004: 163). Clearly the two approaches have much in common. They are both committed to a \nrationalist mode of analysis. They share assumptions about the key actors in world politics \n(states), their attributes (rational utility-maximizers), and the context of their interaction \n(anarchy). Furthermore, whatever their disagreements over the role of international institutions, \nboth realists and neoliberals assume that states have a purely instrumental attitude towards them: \ninstitutions are useful insofar as they serve interests that states have developed prior to and \nindependently of their participation in institutionalized interaction. Not surprisingly, two leading \n 9 \nneoliberals have referred to the two approaches as \u201chalf-siblings\u201d (Keohane and Martin, 2003: \n81). These commonalities ensure that the two approaches are commensurable and that their \nseparate development would thus be undesirable. Indeed, a critic has noted that a \u201cneo-neo \nsynthesis\u201d had been established by the early 1990s (W\u00e6ver, 1996). \n One way to interpret the relationship between the two approaches is to apply the first \nmodel of theoretical dialogue identified by Jupille, Caporaso and Checkel (2003), i.e. \ncompetitive testing. For instance, David Lake implicitly calls for competitive testing when he \ninterprets the debate as showing that \u201cit is an empirical question as to which of the two \napproaches might apply in any particular situation.\u201d (Lake, 2002: 149; see also Waever, 1996 \nand Rousseau, 2002). Thies (2004) develops an innovative interpretation of the difference \nbetween the two theories \u2013 neorealism is a single screening model with no \u201cmemory\u201d of \ncooperative relationships whereas neoliberalism is a repetitive screening system model that \npredicts increasing cooperation over time \u2013 and argues that both are internally coherent theories \nwhose external validity has to be established through empirical tests (although neoliberalism is \nsaid to be better equipped to deal with the temporal dimension of state interaction). \n Other participants in the debate think that some form of closer synthesis is possible and \ndesirable at the theoretical level, but there is substantial disagreement over what forms such \nsynthesis should take. Broadly speaking, three positions on synthesis have emerged. The first one \nis that neorealism subsumes neoliberalism. Grieco has argued that, \u201c[c]ompared to realist theory, \nneoliberal institutionalism understates the range of uncertainties and risks states believe they \nmust overcome to cooperate with others. Hence, realism provides a more comprehensive theory \nof the problem of cooperation than does neoliberal institutionalism\u201d (Grieco, 1988: 131).  In the \nsame vein, John Mearsheimer argued that \u201cliberal institutionalism can hardly be called a \n 10 \ntheoretical alternative to realism, but instead should be seen as subordinate to it\u201d (Mearsheimer, \n1994\/1995: 24). The second position is that neoliberalism subsumes neorealism. Robert Keohane \nand Lisa Martin argued that, \u201c[b]y seeking to specify the conditions under which institutions can \nhave an impact and cooperation can occur, neoliberal theory shows under what conditions realist \npropositions are valid. It is in this sense that institutionalism claims to subsume realism\u201d \n(Keohane and Martin, 1995: 42).   \nThe third position is that the two approaches are theoretically complementary and neither \ncan claim analytical priority or comprehensiveness. A sustained argument for the integration of \nkey components of these approaches into an overarching framework has been made by Andreas \nHasenclever, Peter Meyer and Volker Rittberger (2000). They argue that both perspectives offer \na partial interpretation of the conditions of cooperation and that an effort at synthesis should \nfocus on identifying the different contexts (or \u201cdomains of application\u201d, in the terminology of \nJupille et al., 2003) in which neorealist or neoliberal expectations about cooperation are justified. \nThe foundation of their synthesis is a theory of state motivation, which specifies under which \nconditions states are strongly concerned about relative gains (and thus their behavior conforms to \nneorealist expectations) and under which conditions they are interested mainly or exclusively in \nabsolute gains (and thus conform to neoliberal expectations).4 Neoliberal hypotheses explain \ninternational cooperation when absolute gain concerns clearly outweigh relative gains \nconsiderations, while neorealist analysis is more appropriate when the opposite is the case. In \nthis sense, the two approaches are complementary, and constructing a theoretical synthesis \n\u201cbecomes a matter of specifying the conditions under which relative gains are severe and the \nconditions under which they are slight or completely dominated by calculations of absolute \n 11 \ngains\u201d (Hasenclever et al., 2000: 17). The next section presents an alternative way of \nsynthesizing the two approaches.  \n \nThe theoretical parsimony criterion: relative gains problems as commitment problems \nSome arguments for synthesis based on domains of application assume that the crucial difference \nbetween neorealism and neoliberalism is that the former stresses the importance of relative gains \nwhile the latter stresses the importance of absolute gains. However, the core of the neoliberal \nresearch program is not an assumption about state motivations \u2013 that is, the priority of absolute \ngains over relative gains \u2013 but the idea that the difficulty of having agreements enforced is the \ncrucial obstacle to cooperation under anarchy (a problem summarized by Grieco as \u201cfear of \ncheating\u201d). Neoliberal theory shows under what circumstances these difficulties are more or less \nsevere, and specifies the role of institutions in overcoming them, mainly, but not only, by \nenhancing the quality of information available to states. Seen in this light, the crucial question \nraised by the neo-neo debate is not \u201cin which circumstances are states concerned with relative \ngains?\u201d but \u201cin which circumstances can states achieve a mutually acceptable distribution of \ngains, even when they are concerned about relative gains?\u201d In this section we argue that the \nneoliberal research program is able to provide a comprehensive and satisfactory answer to the \nlatter, more fundamental question, and that therefore the subsumption of neorealism under \nneoliberalism offers a more parsimonious route to synthesis than the domains-of-application \nroute. \nRelative gains concerns are intractable only where there is a combination of very specific \nconditions (Keck, 1993: 53). First, the sensitivity to relative gains must be strong enough to \noverride the absolute benefits of cooperation. This sensitivity is the variable that Grieco and \n 12 \nothers focus on, but three more are often overlooked. Second, the gains from cooperation must \nnot be perfectly divisible. If they are perfectly divisible, then states can agree on a distribution \nthat preserves the ratio or the absolute difference of power resources between them, or at least \nensures that any relative gain remains within acceptable limits. Third, side-payments must not be \nfeasible. If they were, the state obtaining relative gains from the main transaction could \ncompensate the relative losers so as to redress the balance of power. Finally, also issue linkages \nmust be impossible. Issue linkage consists in agreeing on and implementing two or more \ncooperation projects that are jointly acceptable to all parties but individually unacceptable to one \nor more of them, for instance because of relative gains concerns. In this article we consider side-\npayments and issue-linkage as two different forms of compensation. \nSince even states with a very strong relative gain orientation5 would still be able to cooperate \nif they could transfer side-payments or implement issue-linkages, the \u201crelative gains problems\u201d \nboils down essentially to the question under which conditions compensation is possible. When it \nis possible, any agreement that produces positive absolute gains can lead to a situation in which \neach party has positive absolute gains and relative gains concerns are assuaged. Grieco concedes \nthat compensation can solve relative gains problems, but retorts that this solution is not always \navailable or effective. He argues that \u201cwe know that solutions to relative gains and cheating \nproblems sometimes are available and sometimes are not, and we want to know why. We know \nalso that solutions to these two types of problems sometimes work and sometimes do not, and \nagain we want to understand why\u201d (Grieco, 1993: 320).   \n The key argument of this article is that this question can be answered from within the \nanalytical boundaries of neoliberal theory itself. Once the \u201crelative gains problem\u201d is redefined \nas the availability and effectiveness of compensation, as it should be, we no longer have \u201ctwo \n 13 \ntypes of problems\u201d, but only one: the risk of cheating. This is because the strategic structure of \ncompensation agreements is not different from the \u201cgames\u201d analyzed by neoliberal theory, \nnotably the prisoners\u2019 dilemma and the assurance game. Thus, the \u201crelative gains problem\u201d is \nonly a special case of the set of the commitment problems analyzed by neoliberalism, and not an \nadditional implication of anarchy, as realists have claimed.6 Since neoliberalism provides the \nconceptual and theoretical tools for answering Grieco\u2019s questions quoted above, subsuming \nneorealism under neoliberalism is the most parsimonious way to synthesize the two approaches.  \n This does not imply that neoliberalism is able to explain 100 per cent of the variance in \ninternational cooperation.7 States may fail to cooperate over divisible gains, or to overcome \nindivisibilities through compensation agreements, because of a variety of reasons, such as \nbureaucratic politics, failure to accommodate domestic veto players, norms of appropriateness \nthat make certain compromises unacceptable, to name just a few factors that may prevent actors \nto cooperate and compensate in many situations. These factors may be emphasized by theories \nthat do not depend on the assumptions shared by neoliberalism and neorealism, notably the \nassumption of states as rational unitary actors with exogenously given preferences. Our argument \nthat neoliberalism can subsume neorealist explanations based only on relative gains does not \nextend to other theories relevant to cooperation, including \u2013 crucially \u2013 several realist theories \nthat reject, modify, or add to the list of \u201cneo-neo\u201d assumptions. In this sense, the scope of the \nproposed synthesis is limited to the causal conditions identified by the two theories.   \nNeoliberalism can determine the conditions under which compensation agreements are \npossible by focusing on the variable that Grieco has rightly stressed as the theoretical core of \nneoliberalism: the fear that the counterpart will cheat. Neoliberalism identifies two sets of \nconditions: on the one hand, those that cause the fear of cheating; on the other hand, those that \n 14 \ncan mitigate that fear. Considering the first set of conditions, fear of cheating should be minimal \nif the gains from cooperation are perfectly divisible: if this is the case, states can solve the \nrelative gains problem by dividing the gains so as to keep any change of relative power within \nacceptable limits, and successful cooperation does not require compensation that may be \nwithheld by one party. To keep changes of relative power within mutually acceptable limits may \nmean to aim at preserving the absolute difference of power resources between them, or at \npreserving the original ratio of power resources, or a mix of both.8 The choice is likely to depend \non whether absolute or percentage advantages in power are perceived as more threatening, which \n\u2013 as Mosher (2003: 648-51) notes \u2013 is ultimately an empirical question.9 \nSome goods, however, are not completely divisible for material or ideational reasons.10 In \nsuch cases, the parties may agree to redress relative gains through side-payments or issue \nlinkage. If the delivery of the side-payment, or of the object of linkage, is simultaneous to the \nmain transaction, the opportunity for cheating and consequently the need for trust are \nminimized.11 Indeed, Keohane (1986: 22) notes that \u201cextreme examples of purely simultaneous \nexchange indicate hostility and distrust\u201d. The problem of trust arises when there are \u201ctime \nasymmetries in delivery\u201d (Coleman, 1990: 91), which introduce an element of risk for those who \nmust deliver their part of the deal before receiving a return. Sequential exchange is more \ndemanding in terms of trust than simultaneous exchange: in addition to having to bargain over \nthe nature and size of compensation, the actors have to worry about compliance if one or more \nparticipants would benefit from reneging on their promises. Similarly, redressing relative gains \nthrough issue linkage sometimes means that different actors \u201cdeliver the goods\u201d at different \ntimes, which increases the opportunities for cheating and therefore the need of trust.  \n 15 \nIn situations in which gains are not perfectly divisible and compensation is not perfectly \nsimultaneous, neoliberalism expects the fear of cheating to depend crucially on the (perceived) \npayoff structure. Compensation agreements can be conceptualized as games in which the players \nprefer mutual cooperation (one side accepts the main transaction and the other pays the \ncompensation) to no cooperation. To what extent a party fears the other may cheat depends on \nwhether it believes that the other party prefers mutual cooperation to unilateral defection or vice \nversa. Assuming symmetry between the players, a preference for mutual cooperation over \nunilateral defection results in an assurance game, whereas a preference for unilateral defection \nover mutual cooperation results in a prisoners\u2019 dilemma. Neoliberals argue that cooperation is \neasier in assurance games than prisoners\u2019 dilemmas, but the actual preference for mutual \ncooperation over unilateral defection will facilitate cooperation only if the counterpart has \nreliable information about this ordering. Possessing credible information about preferences is \ntherefore crucial.12 \n   In sum, divisibility, simultaneity and the payoff structure determine whether there is fear of \ncheating. Neoliberalism also indicates which conditions may mitigate this fear. Even when all \nactors prefer their own unilateral defection to mutual cooperation \u2013 or risk-averse actors must \nassume that this is the case \u2013 compensation is still possible when the players expect to continue \nto interact in the future and value the gains from future cooperation highly. In these \ncircumstances, cooperation is more likely when states can effectively detect and punish \ndefectors. This requires the ability to verify compliance with commitments and the capacity to \nsanction actors that do not comply. Information about behavior is therefore crucial. International \ninstitutions can mitigate fears of cheating by improving the quality of the information available \nto states. As Keohane noted, \u201c[i]nternational regimes can be thought of as arrangements that \n 16 \nfacilitate nonsimultaneous exchange\u201d (Keohane, 1984: 129, his emphasis). But also the number \nof actors is important, because both detection and punishment are more difficult when many \nactors are involved. In addition to the problem of cheating, agreements involving side-payments \nor issue linkages face bargaining problems, which have been extensively analyzed by neoliberals \nas well as realists (e.g. Krasner, 1991; Martin, 1992; Fearon, 1998). \nIn sum, the neoliberal theoretical framework identifies what generates and what mitigates the \nfear of cheating or, in other words, it shows when trust is necessary for cooperation and what \nmay generate the required level of trust. This framework provides the conceptual and theoretical \ntools for examining not only the commitment problems faced by absolute-gains seekers, but also \nthose plaguing states concerned about relative gains and thus interested in reducing or \neliminating them through compensation agreements. Contrary to what leading realists maintain, \nconsiderations about relative gains are not a further hindrance generated by anarchy \nindependently from and in addition to concerns about cheating, because relative gains \nconsiderations inhibit cooperation only to the extent that states are concerned about cheating. In \nprinciple states can overcome relative gains problems through compensation, but in practice they \noften fail to do so because compensation agreements are difficult to negotiate and enforce in an \nanarchic international system. Neoliberalism shows that (1) the enforcement problem is a \nvariable that depends on a number of circumstances; (2) states can manipulate these \ncircumstances to some extent, for instance by improving the availability and quality of \ninformation through international institutions. To the extent that the neoliberal research program \nis able to specify the conditions under which compensation agreements succeed or fail, it \nsubsumes the realist focus on relative gains. \n \n 17 \nThe empirical fit criterion: Austro-Prussian cooperation, 1763-1795 \nArguments for subsumption based on theoretical parsimony are unlikely to be fully convincing \nwithout showing that the synthesis fits the empirical evidence at least as well as the subsumed \ntheory. Ideally, this means that the subsuming theory should be able to account for all empirical \ninstances that can be explained by the subsumed theory, and more. However, few empirical \nresearch designs can hope to capture all empirical instances of the phenomena of interest. For \nthis reason, requiring a strict application of the empirical fit criterion would make any attempt at \nsynthesis exceedingly difficult and, thus, introduce an anti-synthesis bias in the theoretical \nlandscape. Instead of expecting that subsumption be empirically verified, therefore, it is more \nfruitful to ask how it could be falsified. An argument for subsumption can be considered \nfalsifiable if it is in principle possible to identify (a significant number of) empirical instances \nexplained by the subsumed theory but not by the purported subsuming theory. We believe that \nfalsifiability can still be ensured through a pragmatic and less demanding variant of the empirical \nfit criterion: the subsuming theory should be able to account for those instances that are most \nlikely to be explained by the subsumed theory. If this can be shown to be the case, it would \nsupport at least a prima facie case for subsumption.  From the perspective of research design and \ncase selection, the criterion can be operationalized by means of two general guidelines. First, the \npotential impact of variables falling outside of the purview of both the subsumed and the \nsubsuming theory should be controlled for or minimized.  Second, the analysis should focus on \ncases where the causal mechanisms identified by the subsumed theory should be expected to be \nparticularly powerful.   \n The application of these rules to the relationship between neorealism and neoliberalism \nsuggested to us to analyse Austria\u2019s and Prussia\u2019s attempts to cooperate in the second half of the \n 18 \neighteenth century. These cases comply with the first guideline, since the potential influence of \n\u201cconfounding\u201d factors is minimal: most notably, the small circle of decision-makers in those \nstates minimizes the impact of bureaucratic politics, absolutist rule in foreign policy reduces the \neffect of pressure-group politics, and the weakness of norms of national self-determination and \nterritorial integrity provided little normative resistance to territorial encroachments, swaps, and \ncompensations. Both neorealism and neoliberalism tend to assume exogeously given goals, and \ntheir application in the period under consideration is faciliated by the fact that in the eighteenth \ncentury the goals of states were relatively well defined as well as compatible with neorealist \nassumptions: most rulers of the time shared the belief of Louis XIV that \u201cto aggrandize oneself is \nthe worthiest and most agreeable occupation of a sovereign\u201d. The acquisition and retention of \nterritory was the most important objective of foreign policy, and throughout the eighteenth \ncentury \u201cterritories were shuffled around, swopped and bartered in unscrupulous fashion.\u201d \n(Luard, 1992: 202).  In considering possible moves on the diplomatic chessboard, rulers were \nconstantly trying to estimate both absolute and relative gains in terms of the size, population, \nrevenues and strategic value of territories. \n Eighteenth-century Austro-Prussian attempt at cooperation also comply with the second \nguideline. In that period relative gain concerns were undoubtedly highly relevant among \nEuropean states, and probably nowhere more than in the relationship between Austria and \nPrussia (see below). Selecting two states with unambiguously high relative gains concerns does \nnot only increase the fit with neorealist theory; it also helps address a common problem of \nempirical research on relative gains: when preference rankings are not declared explicitly and \nreliably by the actors, the same behavior at the bargaining table may be interpreted as an \nindication of an interest in the largest possible share of absolute gains as well as the desire to \n 19 \navoid relative losses. This ambiguity presents a significant challenge to the falsifiability of \nexplanations based on relative gains. Focusing on eighteenth-century Austria and Prussia \nminimizes this problem because abundant historical evidence shows that the latter motivation \nwas undoubtedly important in their relationship \n We begin with a description of the goals of the two states. Austria and Prussia had a keen \ninterest in dividing Germany and Poland between them (Aretin, 1997: 110-111, 173).  They also \nhad more specific territorial goals. The Prussians wanted to expand their dominion in western \nPoland, where they particularly coveted the cities of Danzig and Thorn, as well as in southern \nGermany, where they wanted the Franconian margravates of Ansbach and Bayreuth. Other \nterritories coveted by the Prussians were Electoral Saxony, Mecklenburg and Swedish Pomerania \n(Friedrich der Gro\u00dfe, 1986 [1768]: 366-376). On the other hand, the Habsburg monarchy was \nespecially interested in strengthening its position in southern Germany, notably Bavaria, in order \nto consolidate its scattered possessions, which ranged in the west from its core in Austria and \nHungary to the Austrian Netherlands. Both states could have attempted to acquire these \nterritories through war, but cooperating with one another would have provided a more certain \nand less costly way of territorial expansion at the expense of weaker states.  \n Austria and Prussia had also severe relative gains concerns in relation to each other. They \nwere bitter rivals, especially over their relative status in Germany. Paul Schroeder notes that \n\u201c[t]he prime requirement of the balance of power for Austria [\u2026] was to prevent Prussia from \ngrowing in power relative to itself, especially in Germany\u201d (Schroeder, 1994: 14), while Prussia \nhad the opposite goal. Both states were concerned about each other\u2019s strength throughout the \nperiod considered here. In sum, cooperation between the two powers entailed opportunities for \nabsolute gains as well as the dreaded possibility of relative losses. \n 20 \n Between 1763 and 1795, Prussia and Austria managed to overcome relative gains \nconcerns and achieve absolute gains with regard to the partition of Polish territories, but they \ncould not achieve the same result when German territories were involved. Why? The neoliberal \ntoolbox can explain this puzzle. We will examine four opportunities for coordinated territorial \nexpansion that arose between the end of the Seven Years War and 1795: the First Polish partition \nin 1772, the Austrian attempts to annex Bavaria in the 1770s, the Bavarian exchange plan of \n1792 and the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. We will argue that what made cooperation \npossible in two of those instances and impossible in the other two were the different level of fear \nof cheating in those situations, which in turn depended on the divisibility of the gains and the \nsimultaneity of the exchange.  \nThe first Polish partition, 1772  \nThe first successful attempt at cooperation was the First Polish partition. An insurrection against \nRussian influence erupted in Poland in 1768 and disturbances in the region of Poland bordering \nHungary gave the Habsburgs the pretext to occupy at first the county of Spisz and then other \nterritories in southern Poland. There were signs that Vienna intended to bring those territories \npermanently under Habsburg rule (Glassl, 1969: 23-50).  Frederick came to see these \ndevelopments as an opportunity to achieve peacefully the long-cherished goal to expand his \nkingdom at the expense of its eastern neighbor. In May 1771 he persuaded the Russian foreign \nminister Nikita Panin that the time was ripe for seeking a negotiated partition of Polish territory. \nThe Austrian government heard of the ongoing Prussian-Russian negotiation and started \nconsidering various options for a partition scheme (Kaplan, 1962: 139-159; Roider, 1982: 133-\n138).  In January 1772 prince Kaunitz, the Austrian chancellor, informed Frederick of Vienna\u2019s \nwillingness to negotiate the partition, insisting that \u201cperfect equality\u201d of gains was essential: \n 21 \nPrussia and Russia would decide what territories they would incorporate and Austria would take \na portion \u201cdirectly and equally proportional to the share that Prussia would take\u201d (Kaplan, 1962: \n162). The three countries started negotiations issuing repeated assurances that their relative \npower was not to be altered. Discussions about the relative value of the shares claimed by the \nthree powers made up most of the negotiation, with each of them downplaying the economic and \nstrategic value of the land it claimed and denouncing the exorbitant nature of the others\u2019 requests \n(Kaplan, 1962: 158-173). As a result of Austria\u2019s superior bargaining power, due to a lesser \ninterest in concluding the deal and its determination not to lose ground vis-\u00e0-vis Prussia, the \npartition conventions of August 1772 gave Vienna the largest share in terms of area and \npopulation. However, given the high strategic importance of Prussia\u2019s acquisitions, neither \nVienna nor Berlin can be said to have obtained significant relative gains from the agreement. \nCooperation was successful because the Polish territory was considered highly divisible \nby the three powers, which were able to carve out portions of Poland in such a way as to \ndetermine precisely the size of each power\u2019s (absolute and relative) gains. Given the low level of \ntrust among the three states, the simultaneous appropriation of gains was the key factor, since no \nstate would have conceded present gains in exchange for future compensation. The powers \nagreed a date for the simultaneous occupation of their acquisitions and this avoided serious \nenforcement problems.     \nBavaria and Ansbach-Bayreuth, 1770s  \nAs noted above, Austria aimed for the annexation of Bavaria, or at least a portion of it, while \nFrederick aimed at securing the union of Ansbach and Bayreuth to Prussia and possibly the \nannexation of J\u00fclich and Berg. From 1770 onwards the two great powers signaled to each other \ntheir willingness to negotiate on these issues as part of a general agreement on the division of \n 22 \nGerman territories (Aretin, 1997: 178, 185).  The Polish partition of 1772 unleashed panic in \nGermany since it indicated that the smaller German states risked becoming victims of Prussian \nand Austrian collusion. Indeed, many observers \u2013 including the French government \u2013 suspected \nthat while negotiating the Polish partition Austria and Prussia had reached an agreement also on \nBavaria, Bayreuth, Ansbach and other territories (Aretin, 1997: 180, 183).13 However, \nnegotiations were hindered by the reciprocal mistrust between Frederick on the one hand and \nKaunitz and the Austrian co-regent Joseph II on the other. Neither the Austrian nor the Prussian \nrulers were willing to defy blatantly the constitution of the German Reich and simply occupy the \ncoveted territories, as they had done in Poland. Both preferred to wait for the death of the \nincumbent rulers of those principalities, who were without direct heirs, and then press their \nclaims with at least some semblance of legality. At that point, the active cooperation, or at least \nthe acquiescence, of the other German great power was highly desirable for both of them, since \nthat would have considerably increased the likelihood of success and possibly avoided a war. \nThe problem was that no one could have predicted when the succession crises would occur in \nBavaria and in Ansbach-Beyreuth and, therefore, when either Prussia or Austria would have \nbeen expected to honor a commitment to support the other. The Austrians and Frederick did not \ntrust each other sufficiently to agree to a sequential deal. This enforcement problem reduced the \nincentive to reach an agreement in the first place. Another reason why reciprocal mistrust \nhindered negotiation on German territories is that by presenting written proposals each side \nwould have risked having their plans exposed by the other in front of the whole Reich, and \nFrance, with serious damage for their reputation. \u201cThe rivalry of the two German powers was too \nstrong, and the trust between them too weak, to allow open negotiations\u201d (Aretin, 1997: 178, see \nalso 179 and 184).  \n 23 \nThese problems persisted when a sudden opportunity arose in 1777 for the Austrians to \nachieve their goal, as the succession crisis in the Bavarian branch of the Wittelsbach family \nbrought to the throne elector Karl Theodor of the Palatine branch. The Austrian government and \nKarl Theodor had been engaged in complex negotiations about the cession of Bavarian territory \nto Austria (Thomas, 1989). Frederick was aware of these negotiations and was determined to \nprevent Austria from achieving a unilateral gain.  He saw only two methods of doing this: to \nwage war against Austria or to negotiate an agreement that would have secured the margravates \nof Ansbach and Bayreuth for Prussia (Bernard, 1965:  51-74). Such an agreement would have \nensured absolute gains for both parties and avoided significant relative gains. However, in \nJanuary 1778 Austria tried to create a fait accompli by pressing Karl Theodor into signing a \nconvention that ceded one third of the country (Lower Bavaria) to Vienna; additionally, it \nstipulated that any further Austrian acquisition in Bavaria would be compensated in the Austrian \nNetherlands.  At the order of the impatient Joseph, Austrian troops immediately occupied \nBavarian territory. As a result of this sudden move, Frederick posed as the defender of the Reich \nconstitution, and prepared for confrontation with Vienna. The Austrians remained persuaded that \nan agreement could be reached and offered to recognize Prussian claims to Ansbach and \nBayreuth and other minor territorial adjustments in Germany in exchange for Frederick\u2019s \nacceptance of the Bavarian annexation. Prince Henry and the minister of state Hertzberg advised \nto accept the offer, but Frederick convinced himself that \u201ca second, most secret agreement had \nbeen negotiated between the Austrians and Karl Theodor in which the latter had agreed to \nsurrender all of his possessions to them at a somewhat later time\u201d (Bernard, 1965: 72).  During \nApril and May 1778 a number of proposals and counterproposals were exchanged between \nVienna and Berlin, which involved complex sets of territorial transfers among Austria, Prussia, \n 24 \nthe Elector Palatine and Saxony. But both sides were reluctant to commit themselves to formal \nproposals because they feared that their counterpart might betray them and publicize the \nagreement. Joseph worried that, if the Prussians made public his proposals, any remaining belief \nin the legality of the convention that had given Lower Bavaria to Austria would be destroyed, \nwhile Frederick feared that Joseph was not really interested in a settlement and would use the \nnegotiation over compensations as a trap to discredit him before the German princes (Aretin, \n1997: 192; Bernard, 1965: 94).  Because both rulers had appealed to Reich legality in presenting \ntheir claims, they found it difficult to seek a compromise without loss of reputation.14 \u201cHowever \npassive the role of the Reich during the first phase of the conflict about the Bavarian succession, \nmerely by virtue of its existence it prevented an arrangement that would have meant the \noverthrow of the existing territorial property rights\u201d (Aretin, 1997: 192). The failure of the \nnegotiation led to the War of Bavarian Succession in 1778.  \nThe negotiations failed for a number of reasons. First, in Germany the Reich constitution \nmade it harder to reach an agreement because it gave some amount of protection to the territorial \nintegrity of the smaller principalities, thereby inhibiting precise compensations (Schroeder, 1994: \n28-29).  The consent of several actors would be legally required under the Reich rules, in \nparticular that of the heir to the Bavarian throne, the duke of Zweibr\u00fccken, who was opposed to \nthe cession of Bavaria. In contrast, the Polish Sejm had been forced to agree to the partition by \nmeans of military threats. Second, neither Frederick nor Joseph was sure that the other preferred \nan agreement to the opportunity to discredit him in front of the German princes and the European \ngovernments. Third, and most importantly, the exchange could not have been simultaneous, \nneither before 1777 because of uncertainty about the timing and outcome of succession crises in \nthe territories concerned, nor after 1777 because Austria had already reached an agreement with \n 25 \nthe ruler of Bavaria and proceeded to the occupation, while Prussia was merely promised \ncompensation at a later stage. A major sequential exchange, however, would have required an \namount of trust that was wanting between the two actors at the time. In the end, \u201conly the \ninsuperable mistrust of the two German great powers averted in 1778-79 the partition of the \ndomains of the Wittelsbach, which had been contemplated in Berlin and Vienna\u201d (Aretin, 1992: \n438).   \nBavaria and Danzig-Thorn, 1792 \nAustria and Prussia resumed sustained negotiations about the division of Germany and Poland in \nthe early 1790s. Discussions about a formal alliance between the two German powers started in \n1791, causing much concern among the smaller German rulers who feared an imminent partition \nof the Reich. In February 1792 Vienna and Berlin agreed to an offensive alliance against \nrevolutionary France. The defeat of France was not their ultimate goal but a precondition for \nattaining more general objectives, that is, a general territorial reorganization of central Europe in \nwhich territorial conquests and financial gains at the expense of France were only one aspect \n(Aretin, 1997: 390; Blanning, 1986:  113-116).  The crucial goal for the Austrians was still the \nacquisition of Bavaria, and they tried to secure Prussia\u2019s cooperation by linking the exchange of \nthe Austrian Netherlands for Bavaria to acquisitions for Prussia at the expense of Poland. The \nnegotiations started in the spring of 1792 and led an initial understanding by which Prussia \nwould support the Bavarian exchange and Austria would consent to Prussian gains in Poland, \nnotably the annexation of Danzig and Thorn.  \nHowever, at the end the two powers failed to reach an agreement, and this happened \nessentially for two reasons. The first is that both sides were uncertain about the deal that the \nother side would be willing to accept, and this uncertainty encouraged tough bargaining tactics. \n 26 \nInfluential members of the Austrian State Conference were convinced that the terms of the initial \nagreement would generate excessive relative gains for Prussia, since Austria would be \nexchanging an old possession for a new one while Prussia would be acquiring new territories. To \nassuage these concerns, the Austrian negotiators demanded that Prussia provide what they called \na \u201csupplement\u201d to Austria, in the form of the margravates of Ansbach and Beyreuth, which had \nrecently fallen to Prussia. The Prussians retorted that Bavaria was more valuable to Austria than \nthe Netherlands and ruled out the cession of the margravates. Internal documents of the two \ngovernments show that the Austrian negotiators were prepared to accept an agreement involving \nthe Bavarian exchange even without any supplement and that the Prussian king Frederick \nWilliam was inclined to cede the margravates as a side-payment provided that a sufficiently large \nportion of Poland could be secured. But vis-\u00e0-vis their counterparts the negotiators maintained \nthat no agreement could be reached if their demands were not satisfied, and these claims \nproduced a lengthy stalemate that was solved only when the parties managed to agree that \nAustria should obtain the desired supplement not from Prussia but from France, after the armies \nof the two German powers had defeated the Jacobins and conquered Alsace (Lord, 1915: 328, \n331, 338, 348). \nHowever, ultimately the Bavarian exchange was thwarted by enforcement problems \nrather than bargaining problems. The complex negotiations over indemnities and compensations \nthat took place in the spring and summer of 1792 were based on the \u201cprinciple of complete \nparity: the respective indemnities were to be equal; they were to be gathered in simultaneously; if \nthe one proved impracticable, the other must also be abandoned\u201d (Lord, 1915: 357).  This \nprinciple came to be questioned and finally repudiated by the Prussians. In July 1792 the \nPrussian minister Schulenberg started to suspect that the Austrians were not really interested in \n 27 \nan agreement and that their demands concerning the supplement were aimed at sabotaging the \nexplicit goal of the alliance \u2013 that is, seeking territorial acquisitions as \u201cindemnity\u201d for the costs \nof war against France - \u201cout of a Machiavellian calculation that fifty million more of debts would \nnot ruin a state with the resources of Austria, while the same loss would be fatal to Prussia\u201d \n(Lord, 1915: 336).  In other words, Schulenberg suspected that Austria was prepared to accept \nabsolute losses in order to achieve relative gains vis-\u00e0-vis Prussia. In this \u201charrowing state of \nsuspicion and uncertainty\u201d (Lord, 1915: 336), the Prussian minister decided that Prussia had to \nobtain an indemnity for the cost of the war whatever might happen. He and his colleagues agreed \nthat Prussia ought to take possession of its acquisitions in Poland as soon as Russia would \nconsent to it; only then would Prussia give Austria any help to achieve the Bavarian exchange \nand possibly allow her to make additional acquisitions if it were clearly proven that a net loss \nwould result from the exchange.  \nThis became the official negotiating position of Prussia after the unexpected defeat of the \nPrussian army at the hand of the French at Valmy in September 1792. After Valmy the Prussians \nwere even keener to secure an acquisition that would balance their losses and were unwilling to \nwait until the end of the war with France, which was a precondition for achieving the Bavarian \nexchange and providing the side-payment required by Austria. The Prussians demanded the \nabandonment of the principle of simultaneous gains: Prussia had to obtain its acquisitions at once \nand then help Austria acquiring hers whenever possible (Lord, 1915: 349, 356-357; Schroeder, \n1994: 119).  But the Austrians were unwilling to support Prussia in Poland before they could \nmake sure that adequate compensations for Austria were feasible, since they did not want to \u201cend \nup paying the transaction costs and still not getting the transaction\u201d (Schroeder, 1994: 121).  The \nAustrians therefore proposed a plan for the temporary Austrian occupation of a Polish district as \n 28 \na security, which was to be returned to the Polish state in case the acquisition of Bavaria and a \nsuitable supplement should later be achieved. This demand was rejected by the Prussians, who \nthought that the Austrian occupation of a Polish district would be unacceptable to Russia and, \nmoreover, suspected that the Austrians had presented that demand simply in order to thwart \nPrussian gains entirely (Lord, 1915: 359, 368). If the Austrians had accepted a settlement of the \nBavarian question in the context of a general reorganization of Europe after the defeat of France, \ncooperation between them and the Prussians would have been feasible. However, given the lack \nof trust between the two powers, and the likelihood of Prussian defection after having secured its \nobjectives in Poland, Vienna could not abandon the principle of simultaneous gains, and no \nagreement could therefore be reached.  \nThe third Polish partition, 1795 \nAustro-Prussian cooperation proved thus to be short-lived, but it was soon revived in the last \nPolish partition. Berlin, which had not managed to reach its objectives in Poland by agreement \nwith Vienna, switched its allegiance to St. Petersburg. In 1791, the Polish had adopted a new \nConstitution that worried Russia and led to its invasion of Poland. Prussia, despite being still \nformally allied with Poland, joined in the occupation and the Second Partition ensued in 1793, in \nwhich the Prussia acquired Danzig and the region of Posen (with Thorn) while Russia annexed \nwestern Ukraine. This agreement behind the back of the Austrians, together with the \ndeterioration of the relations between Prussian and Austrian commanders on the western front, \nresulted in severe tensions and increased hostility between Berlin and Vienna.  \nDespite these tensions, the Polish reaction to the Second Partition \u2013 \u201cKo\u015bciuszko\u2019s Uprising\u201d \n\u2013 spurred a joint military intervention and preparations for a final and total partition. The \nAustrians realized that they could expect no assistance by Prussia for the attainment of the \n 29 \nBavarian exchange and decided to seek compensation in Poland for Austria\u2019s war effort on the \nwestern front and for the recent acquisitions of Russia and Prussia (Lukowski, 1999: 1970; \nRoider, 1987: 132-134).  After several months of \u201cacrid negotiations\u201d (Schroeder, 1994, 148), \nduring which Austria and Russia reached a bilateral agreement and even deployed troops against \nPrussia, while Prussia concluded a separate peace with France also to strengthen its hand in \nPoland (Moritz, 1968: 186), the three powers concluded a final partition treaty in October 1795. \nAustria acquired Little Poland (with Lublin and Cracow), Russia acquired Lithuania, and Prussia \nacquired Masovia (with Warsaw). By far the most difficult negotiation issue had been the \npalatinate of Cracow: Austria had long-standing claims on that district but Prussia had occupied \nit during the uprising and was determined to keep it (Lord, 1925: 489-490; Moritz, 1968: 167-\n190).  The partition treaty finally assigned Cracow to Austria, and the Prussians agreed to \nevacuate it within six weeks: until then Russian troops would remain in Warsaw and other \nterritories assigned to Prussia. Moreover, Austrian troops remained in a wedge in Masovia \nbetween the rivers Vistula and Bug as an additional security. In early January 1796, almost \nsimultaneously Prussia evacuated Cracow, Russia evacuated Warsaw and Austria evacuated the \nMasovian wedge (Lukowski, 1999: 179, G\u00f3ralski, 1971: 216). \nIn 1794-96 the Austrians and the Prussians mistrusted each other deeply and were very \nsensitive to relative gains. The Third Partition was successful under these conditions for the same \nreasons that had allowed Prussia, Austria and Russia to accomplish the First Partition. The \nterritory of Poland was regarded as highly divisible by the partitioning powers and the \nappropriation of their respective territorial gains could be simultaneous. The most serious \nappropriation problem was created by Prussia holding a valuable territory assigned to Austria \n 30 \n(Cracow) and this was successfully solved by making the appropriation of important Prussian \ngains (Warsaw and the Masovian wedge) contingent on Prussia honoring its commitments.  \n In sum, between 1763 and 1795 Austria and Prussia had various opportunities for \ncooperation that would have provided absolute gains for both of them without generating \nsignificant relative gains. The two great powers managed to exploit these opportunities in Poland \nbut not in the German Reich. We have argued that the two powers failed to solve their relative \ngains problem in Germany for the same reason they failed to reap absolute gains: the fear of \nbeing cheated. Contextual factors - the unwillingness to blatantly violate the rules of the Reich in \nthe 1770s and the uncertainties of war in 1792 - meant that Prussia and Austria faced some \nconstrains in defining their respective gains and would have been unable to acquire their \nterritorial prizes at the same time. In other words, compared to the partitions of Poland, the gains \nfrom cooperation in Germany were less divisible and their appropriation less simultaneous. \nEither Prussia or Austria would have had to acquiesce to or cooperate in the expansion of the \nother yet remain unsure that the other would (or could) reciprocate. In such circumstances \ncooperation is possible only if the main actors believe that the other side prefers to reciprocate \ncooperation rather than exploit it \u2013 that is, if they trust each other. But the required level of trust \nwas absent in the relationship between Austria and Prussia.  \nEnforcement problems were the main reason for which compensation arrangements involving \nGerman territories were more difficult to achieve than those involving Poland. But also \nbargaining problems played a part. The unwillingness to defy the Reich constitution too blatantly \nled Austria and Prussia to accept that other interested parties \u2013 the rulers of the territories to be \nbartered and their heirs \u2013 had some form of veto power, and this complicated negotiations. \nNeither German power had similar scruples in forcing the Poles to acquiesce to the partition of \n 31 \ntheir country. Moreover, mistrust also hindered negotiations because of the risk of being exposed \nvis-\u00e0-vis the princes of the Reich by a duplicitous counterpart. To sum up the role of the Reich in \nAustro-Prussian cooperation, it was strong enough to prevent cooperation that clearly violated \nReich rules, but not strong enough to assuage concerns about defection from agreements that \nwere compatible with those rules (territorial exchanges with the consent of the legitimate rulers).  \n Could other factors not captured by neoliberal theory explain this particular pattern of \nsuccess and failure? As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, domestic factors are \nunlikely to have had much influence in this period and these countries, and the historical record \nseems to confirm this. Four factors frequently invoked by realist scholars to explain differences \nin international cooperation \u2013 relative gains concerns, relative strength of the parties, fear of a \ncommon enemy, and diplomatic alignments \u2013 also are unable to account for the variation found \nin our cases. First, concerns about relative gains were strong throughout the period. Probably \nthey were even stronger in 1795 than in 1792. Second, while the relative power of Prussia vis-\u00e0-\nvis Austria was stable or declined slightly over the period 1763-1789, cooperation was more \nvolatile \u2013 successful in 1772 and 1795 with regard to Poland, unsuccessful in the 1770s, 1780s \nand 1790s with regard to Germany. Third, concerns about the power of third parties cannot \nexplain by itself the outcomes, since fear of Russian expansionism may have facilitated \ncooperation in 1772 but it did not in 1792. Moreover, if Prussia and Austria had cooperated in \nPoland also for fear of Russia, a fortiori they should have cooperated over German affairs, since \nthe coordinated partition of Germany would have produced absolute gains and improved their \nrelative power vis-\u00e0-vis Russia. Finally, shifting diplomatic alignments are also unable to \naccount for the outcomes, since cooperation occurred in times of Prusso-Russian (First Partition) \nas well as Austro-Russian alliance (Third Partition), while it failed in times of Prusso-Russian \n 32 \n(Bavarian exchange plan of 1778) and even Austro-Prussian alliance (Bavarian exchange plan of \n1792).  \n  \nConclusion \nSince none of the models of dialogue identified by Jupille, Caporaso and Checkel (2003) appears \nto be intrinsically preferable to the others, scholars interested in advancing theoretical synthesis \nin political science would benefit from the development of set of criteria for assessing how \ndifferent synthetic strategies might help solve theoretical and empirical puzzles. We focused on \ntwo criteria, theoretical parsimony and empirical fit, and applied it to a major debate in recent \npolitical science, the controversy among neoliberals and neorealist on cooperation under \nanarchy. Given the significant similarities between the two approaches, nearly all participants in \nthe debate agree that some form of synthesis is possible and desirable, but there is substantial \ndisagreement on what the best \u201cneo-neo synthesis\u201d would be: views range from the subsumption \nof neoliberalism under neorealism, through forms of complementarity based on different \ndomains of application, to the subsumption of neorealism under neoliberalism. \n In this article we provided an argument for the last position, on the basis of theoretical \nparsimony. Contrary to the neorealist position, concern for relative gains is not an obstacle to \ncooperation that is independent from and additional to the fear of cheating. States may overcome \nrelative gains problems by means of compensation agreements, and this raises two crucial \nquestions. First, under what conditions will such agreements be reached? Neoliberalism \nidentifies the variables that affect the expectation of reciprocal cooperation versus defection \nunder anarchy and thus the viability of specific compensation agreements. Second, are states able \nto manipulate these variables in order to increase the likelihood of cooperation? Neoliberalism \n 33 \nshows that states can alter at least one crucial variable \u2013 information \u2013 by creating and supporting \ninternational institutions. Since it can be shown that agreements to mitigate relative gains are but \na special case of the commitment problems analyzed in the neoliberal framework, the most \nparsimonious strategy for synthesis consists in the subsumption of neorealism under \nneoliberalism.  \nThe examination of attempts at cooperation by Austria and Prussia in the second half of the \neighteen century has shown that this theoretical parsimony is not achieved at the expense of \nempirical range. The key to explaining why cooperation between Austria and Prussia succeeded \nin some cases and failed in others is not the extent to which they were concerned about relative \ngains, but the extent to which they feared to be cheated in compensation transactions. By \nexplaining when this fear was low and hence compensation agreements were possible, neoliberal \nhypotheses provide a satisfactory explanation of the vagaries of cooperation in a historical \ncontext where neorealist assumptions are particularly plausible. The historical evidence also \nshowed that two key factors in the explanation of variation across cases \u2013 divisibility and \nsimultaneity \u2013 depended on ideational and institutional constraints that rationalist approaches \nsuch as neoliberalism and neorealism may not be well suited to explain. This examination of \nsynthesis of two rationalist theories therefore ends by pointing at the possible benefits of \nintegrating rationalist and constructivist approaches.   \n  \n 34 \nReferences \nAretin, Karl Otmar von (1992) Tausch, Teilung und L\u00e4nderschacher als Folgen des \nGleichgewichtssytems der europ\u00e4ischen Grossm\u00e4chte.

We would like to thank the \nanonymous referees and Federica Bicchi, Barry Buzan, Michele Chiaruzzi, Marco Clementi, \nRobert Falkner, Robert Frith, Kimberly Hutchings, Nicola Dunbar, Angelo Panebianco, Paola \nRobotti, Graham Smith, Stephen Woolcock and Lorenzo Zambernardi for their comments on \nprevious drafts. We are responsible for the article\u2019s shortcomings. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 For various reasons, none of the labels that have been attached to the two approaches is entirely \nsatisfactory, and we use the terms neoliberalism and neorealism mainly because they are short \nand well entrenched in the literature (Baldwin, 1993).  \n2 Our interpretation of the debate does not rule out that the difference between the two positions \nmay be rooted in a deeper divergence in the way the two approaches understand uncertainty (we \nare grateful to an anonymous reviewer for alerting us to this). Rathbun (2007), for instance, \nsuggests that for realism states are in constant fear of predation, which leads them to assume the \nworst about other states\u2019 intentions; \u201crationalism\u201d, on the contrary, is said to have a more \nagnostic conception of uncertainty, according to which states collect and update information \nabout intentions and behaviour without making a priori assumptions on the danger posed by \nother states.  \n 41 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n3 Further contributions to the debate are, among others, Mastanduno 1991; Liberman 1996; \nMatthews 1996; Berejikian 1997; Mosher 2003; Vezirgiannidou 2008. \n4 Berejikian (1997) develops an interesting perspective on state motivation that is based on \nprospect theory. He hypothesizes that states pursue absolute gains when options are framed as a \nchoice between gains, whereas states pursue relative gains when options are framed as a choice \nbetween losses. \n5 Short of an implausibly pure relative gains orientation, where interactions are constant-sum. \n6 James Fearon (1998: 288) also interprets the relative-gains problem as a commitment problem, \nbut he points at \u201cstates\u2019 inability to commit not to take advantage of greater relative power in the \nfuture\u201d, whereas we examine the commitment to rebalance gains by means of compensation. \n7 We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for highlighting the importance of this point. \n8 We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for directing our attention to this issue. \n9 Empirical testing may be difficult because in many cases the choice may not be perceived as \nvitally important by decision-makers. This could be because (1) if the initial power gap between \nthe states is large compared to the potential gains, they will be less concerned about relative \ngains in general (since such gains are unlikely to make a difference) and specifically less \nconcerned about the choice between preserving the ratio and preserving the absolute difference \nof power; (2) if the initial power gap is small, they will be more concerned about relative gains, \nbut the distinction between ratio-preserving and difference-preserving methods may be less \nsalient as they will yield similar distributions of gains. \n10 As conceived here, indivisibility does not imply nonfungibility, i.e. the belief that a good \ncannot be substituted or exchanged for something of comparable value. For a definition of \nindivisibility that includes nonfungibility (see Hassner, 2003).  \n 42 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n11 In this article trust is simply conceived of as a belief that the other side prefers to reciprocate \ncooperation rather than exploit it (Kydd, 2000; Coleman, 1990).  This is a minimalist definition \nof trust, which denotes the opposite of what Grieco calls \u201cfear of cheating\u201d.  \n12 The features of compensation negotiations as games of incomplete information are elaborated \nin a separate paper. \n13 In January 1774 Edmund Burke commented that \u201cPoland was but a breakfast\u201d and wondered \n\u201cwhere will they dine\u201d (Sutherland, 1960:  514). \n14 These developments confirm Goddard\u2019s (2006) interpretation of indivisibility as constructed \nduring the negotiation process and as the unintended effect of legitimation strategies that lock \nactors into bargaining positions from they can no longer recognize any other claim as legitimate. \n \n"}
