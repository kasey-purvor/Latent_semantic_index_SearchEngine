However, unnoticed by marketing, a quiet revolution has\ntaken place in supply chain management (SCM), where the traditional emphasis on\nleast-cost transactions has given way to a focus on long-term relationships with\na few key suppliers. It is thus apparent that the two disciplines are\nconverging. This article uses a cross-disciplinary approach to explore whether\nthese developments from the field of SCM provide insights into key business-to-\nbusiness relationships.

However, unnoticed by marketing, a quiet revolution\nhas taken place in Supply Chain Management (SCM), where the traditional focus on\nleast-cost transactions has given way to a focus on long-term relationships with a few\nkey suppliers. It is thus apparent that the two disciplines are converging. This paper\nuses a cross-disciplinary approach to explore whether these developments from the\nfield of SCM provide insights into key business-to-business relationships. A detailed\ncase study of a long-term relationship between a business-to-business services\nprovider and a key customer in the construction industry suggests that there is a\ndefinable overlap. The supply chain model illuminates five important elements of the\nKAM relationship and offers a promising method for the evaluation of such\nrelationships. As a result of the research, both supplier and customer companies\nimplemented actions to improve and strengthen their important relationship.\n2INTRODUCTION\nA central notion in Marketing is that its activities are directed towards\nestablishing, developing and maintaining successful exchange relationships (Morgan\n& Hunt 1994; Fruchter and Sigu\u00e9 2005). Within Marketing, the growing domain of\nkey account management (KAM) examines major supply chain relationships,\nprimarily from the supplier\u2019s perspective. A key account is a business-to-business\ncustomer identified by the supplier as being of strategic importance (McDonald,\nMillman and Rogers 1997). KAM relationships are those which are both important\nand complex, often involving customizing products or services and sometimes pricing\nand distribution methods (Cardozo, Shannon and Kenneth 1987; McDonald, Millman\nand Rogers 1997) in the interests of developing collaborative long-term relationships.\nSuch relationships involve costs (investing in customization) and risks (customer and\/\nor supplier power or dependence) that make value capture problematic.\nThe importance of key accounts was emphasized by a recent survey of 207\ncompanies. 28 firms reported that their key accounts were responsible for more than\n50% of sales, and 4 firms said that 80% or more of their sales were to key accounts\n(Gosman and Kelly 2002). A subsequent survey by the same authors found still\ngreater dependence on key accounts and also found that the service demands of key\ncustomers were increasing (Gosman and Kelly 2002).\nThe growing importance of key accounts, and the issue of how the benefits\nfrom collaboration are to be realized by both parties, indicates that the management of\nkey account relationships is a vital area for further study.\n3One lens through which researchers could view KAM relationships is that of\nSCM, a well-established field with a tradition of cross-disciplinary research (Baker\n2004). Largely unnoticed by marketing, there have been substantial developments\nwithin SCM such as strategic procurement (Ryals and Rogers 2006) and marketing\nlogistics (Christopher 2005), which impinge on relationship management. Supply\nchain relationships are now defined as long term relationships with a limited number\nof suppliers, on the basis of mutual confidence (Christopher 2005). At a time when\nmany research constructs and best practices within marketing and SCM seem to be\nconverging, especially in the area of business-to-business services, this paper\naddresses the important and timely research problem of how recent developments in\nSCM might inform KAM.\nThe aim of the current research is to provide insight into KAM relationships\nwhen viewed through a supply chain lens. The objectives are to examine KAM from a\nvalue exchange perspective and identify its key dimensions, to identify a supply chain\nmodel that could inform KAM thinking, and then to apply this model to a key\ninterdependent dyadic customer-supplier relationship. The findings support the\ncontention that SCM thinking informs KAM, identify areas for further research, and\nprovide useful insights for key account managers.\nCONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND\nIn this section, we explore the growing field of KAM and the recent\ndevelopments in the longer-established field of SCM.\n4Key Account Management\nKey Account Management is the study of long-term collaborative\nrelationships between suppliers and buyers, rather than transactional sales-based\napproaches to customer management (Millman and Wilson 1995). Although some\nearly research examined major business-to-business relationship types (Fiocca 1982;\nDwyer, Schurr, and Oh 1987; Shapiro et al. 1987; Burnett 1992), KAM really\nemerged as a separate field of research in the early to mid 1990s amid discussion\nabout whether larger customers were more profitable (Cooper and Kaplan 1991;\nKalwani and Narayandas 1995). The \u2018size versus value\u2019 debate about the definition of\na key account was widened by Millman and Wilson (1996) and McDonald, Millman,\nand Rogers (1997), who defined a key account as a customer of strategic importance\nto the supplier. Research shows that value capture in KAM is not automatic: powerful\ncustomers can choose to use their negotiating muscle to \u2018negotiate away\u2019 benefits\nfrom the supplier (Kalwani and Narayandas 1995), resulting in unprofitable\ncustomers. Yet evidence exists that long-term relationships with larger customers can\npay off for suppliers as well as buyers (Kalwani and Narayandas 1995; Narayandas\nand Rangan 2004) even where power asymmetries are considerable (Narayandas and\nRangan 2004).\nThe reasons why suppliers engage in KAM relationships relate to the longer-\nterm benefits from collaboration. Suppliers benefit from higher revenues and faster\ngrowth rates (Bolen and Davis 1997), whilst customers benefit from having their\nobjectives met, continuity, cooperation and faster response (Sengupta et al. 1997;\nHolmstrom 1998). Both sides benefit in the longer term from lower costs (Sengupta et\n5al. 1997; Byrnes 2002) and the longer-term performance of both parties is better\n(Galbreath 2002). Some key antecedents that have been identified as making these\nrelationships work are trust, adaptability, and cooperation (Dyer 1997; Campbell\n1997; Hausman 2001).\nIn many cases, the adoption of KAM practices by suppliers is driven by the\ndemands of the customer as they rationalize their suppler base and increase their\ndemands on their remaining suppliers (Boles and Johnston 1999; Homburg, Workman\nand Jensen 2002). As the capabilities of the remaining preferred suppliers develop, the\nincentives for customers to built long-term relationships with them increases\n(McDonald, Millman, and Rogers 1997). Because KAM relationships pay off, there is\nan incentive for suppliers to achieve preferred status and to manage their key\naccounts. How they can do this and some dimensions of KAM relationships will now\nbe discussed.\nDimensions of KAM relationships\nPrevious research has identified many aspects of KAM relationships. Our\nobjective in reviewing the existing literature is to establish some underlying salient\ndimensions which can be used as the basis for exploring KAM relationships. We are\ndescribing complex relationships in terms of general variables, so some\ninterrelationships between the variables cannot be ruled out. We will return to this\nproblem later in our discussion.\n6Value: Value creation and value capture are major dimensions of study in\nKAM relationships. The relatively high financial outcomes that characterize KAM\nrelationships (higher revenues, growth and profitability) come about through supply\nchain efficiencies, lower costs to serve, learning curve effects, higher share of spend\netc. (Kalwani and Narayandas 1995; Slywotsky 1995; Sengupta et al. 1997; Ryals,\nBruce, and McDonald 2005). Galbreath (2002) cites evidence of the positive financial\nimpact of long-term strategic partnerships and of efficiently-managed supply chains.\nHowever, poor management of the relationship on the part of the supplier can\nundermine value capture (Kalwani and Narayandas 1995; Reinartz and Kumar 2002).\nTrust: An important underlying affective dimension of KAM relationships,\nparticularly on the customer side, is trust. Trust leads to cost reduction (Sengupta et al.\n1997) through process development and supply chain management (Byrnes 2002).\nTrust may also be an antecedent of investment in the relationship, another\ncharacteristic of KAM, which leads to process improvement and, hence, reliability\nand consistency (Holmstrom 1998). In turn, consistency is one of the characteristics\nof successful KAM relationships (Sengupta et al. 1997). Trust and consistency are\nalso associated with customer retention (Kalwani and Narayandas 1995; Hausman\n2001); and, for the supplier, a higher share of the customer\u2019s spend (Reichheld 1996).\nThis indicates that trust is an interesting dynamic of a KAM relationship from which\nother benefits may flow. Sin et al (2002) explored trust as a component of relationship\norientation and found it unrelated to business performance; yet trust is repeatedly\ncited by key customers as one of the most important elements in supplier selection\n(Woodburn and McDonald 2001).\n7Flexibility: A behavioral dimension of KAM relationships is flexibility and\nresponsiveness to the customer. In the KAM context, this behavioral dimension can\nbe witnessed in activities such as customization, consultancy, and complexity\nmanagement (Campbell 1997; Sengupta et al. 1997; Neu and Brown 2005) plus\nprocess adaptation and investment in the relationship. Previous research indicates that\nsuccessful KAM relationships demonstrate adaptability, cooperation and conflict\nmanagement, social interaction, and the standardization of routine actions (Tikkanen\nand Alajoutsijarvi 2002). Flexibility is associated with faster response, which can\nbenefit suppliers as well as customers: in recent research, suppliers noted faster results\n(faster implementation, for example) as benefits of their KAM relationships\n(Woodburn, Holt and McDonald 2004).\nRelationship Stability: Another dimension of key relationships is duration\n(Hausman 2001). KAM relationships can exhibit considerable stability and duration,\nsometimes formalized into long-term contracts. Multiple contacts and shared systems\nand processes help the relationship to survive managerial changes (McDonald, Rogers\nand Woodburn 2002). High switching costs, which benefit the incumbent supplier,\ndevelop in successful relationships (Sengupta et al. 1997). Longer relationship\nduration may also be associated with reduced coercion and conflict (Hausman 2001)\nand with a growing share of the customer\u2019s spend (Woodburn, Holt, and McDonald\n2004).\nCommunication: Communication is an important underlying dimension of\nKAM relationships (Hausman 2001; Sin et al. 2002). Communications in KAM\n8relationships differ from non-KAM in that they are characterized by multiple\ncommunications links (McDonald and Rogers 1998) between the two organizations.\nBetter communication and more information may lead to improved forecasting,\npossibly through reduced uncertainty (Hausman 2001) and better problem solving.\nOther benefits of the extensive and close communications associated with KAM\nrelationships include faster results because new initiatives can be implemented more\nquickly (Woodburn, Holt, and McDonald 2004). This leads to an acceleration in new\nbusiness with a key account which results in a positive impact on cash flow.\nMoreover, opportunities can be identified faster and more effectively than in non-\nKAM relationships because of the closeness of the relationship and the large number\nof contacts between the two companies (Woodburn and McDonald 2001).\nAlthough not an exhaustive review, this analysis helps to indicate that there\nare some important general characteristics of KAM relationships that differentiate\nthem from non-KAM relationships. Yet the very characteristics that differentiate\nKAM relationships from non-KAM relationships are those that are typical of supply\nchain relationships. We will demonstrate this through a brief review of the literature\nrelating to supply chain relationships.\nThe relational perspective of Supply Chain Management\nSCM has been defined as an integrative, proactive approach (Matthyssens &\nvan den Bulte 1994) to manage the total flow of a distribution channel to the ultimate\ncustomer: \u2018a well-balanced and well-practiced relay team\u2019 (Cooper & Ellram 1993).\nHowever, it has been recognized that a focus on process is insufficient to achieve\nsuccess and that co-operation, trust and proper relationship management can achieve\n9results that are greater than the sum of the parts (Christopher 2005). Close long-term\nrelationships between customers and suppliers have a beneficial impact on\nperformance (Giannakis & Croom 2004). Customer and supplier commit to\ncontinuous improvement and shared benefits by exchanging information openly and\nresolve problems by working together (Sako et al. 1994).\nHistorically, SCM research has adopted a variety of different approaches to\nmeasure inter-organizational, operational, and inter-personal dynamics. Recently,\nGiannakis & Croom (2004) considered the synthesis of business resources and\nnetworks, the synergy between network actors and the synchronization of operational\ndecisions. The International Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) Group studied the\ndyadic interaction of companies (Kern & Willcocks 2002); supply chain integration\nwas considered by Fawcett & Magnan (2002); and networks of relationships by\nHarland et al (2001) and Kemppainen & Vepsalainen (2003). All suggest that the\nrelationship management of supply chain relationships is complex and problematical,\nbut focus on relationships from an operational perspective (time, cost, quality and\nprocesses) rather than from the relationship management perspective called for by,\namongst others, Christopher (1998).\nRelationships as spectrums of interactions\nIn response to calls for a relationship management perspective in SCM,\nHumphries and Wilding (2003; 2004) employed an interdisciplinary approach which\nintegrated Supply Chain Management, Transaction Cost Economics and Relationship\nMarketing concepts to understand the dynamics within a large sample of highly\ninterdependent supply chain dyadic relationships. They used a combination of\n10\nqualitative and quantitative methods to develop a model which enabled rich insights\ninto SCM relationships. This model benefits from an interdisciplinary approach, the\nuse of generalizable concepts that could be applied to KAM, and a relationship\nmanagement perspective.\nHumphries and Wilding (2003; 2004) used an adaptation of Williamson\u2019s\n(1975) Organizations Failure Framework, a descriptive rather than predictive\nrepresentation, as their theoretical model to illustrate the relationship dynamics\nbetween highly collaborative businesses. Williamson\u2019s Failure Framework suggests\nthat the increased costs and tensions of maintaining a close relationship between\nbusinesses may lead to higher management costs and \u2018bad behaviors\u2019 resulting in\nreversion to open market transactions. Utilizing the concept of a self-reinforcing\nfeedback effect within collaborative relationships (Hambrick, et al. 2001, Lambert et\nal. 1996, Luo & Park 2004), Williamson\u2019s (1975) framework dimensions are shown in\nthe negative and positive forms in Figure 1. These cycles represent the opposite ends\nof the spectrum that one might expect to encounter within a dyadic, interdependent\nsupply chain relationship.\n- Bring in Figure 1 -\nThe Humphries and Wilding model used SCM literature and academic and\npractitioner focus groups to identify five main dimensions of collaborative supply\nchain relationships. These are, together with their Cronbach\u2019s Alpha scores: Value\n(0.88), Reliability (0.76.), Creativity (0.80), Stability (0.77), and Communication\n(0.76). They thus demonstrated strong internal consistency in the original research.\n11\nThe Humphries and Wilding model is particularly attractive in the current research\ncontext because of the apparent \u2018fit\u2019 between the KAM dimensions set out above and\nthe key dimensions of SCM they identified.\nValue: Supply chain value requires the development of win-win relationships\nwhich seek efficiency and stability, particularly when dealing with new technology\ndevelopment uncertainties (Tompkins 2000). Tensions between parties are balanced\nwithin a long-term, pragmatic working arrangement (Lamming 1993; Perks & Easton\n2000). Trust, friendliness and other soft features of long term co-operative\nrelationships do not guarantee greater understanding and satisfaction; in fact, the\ngreater the dependence, the more important is measuring and monitoring performance\n(Harland 1995; 1996a; 1996c). The main obstacle to value enhancement seems to be\nmotivating supply chain members and company staff by communicating a clear vision\nof the benefits to be achieved in an environment of great complexity and uncertainty\n(Harland 1996b; Boddy et al. 2000).\nReliability: Reliability within the Supply Chain requires a concentration on\nservice and product delivery, reducing joint costs and risks, and building trust. The\nevolution of Lean Supply, with its emphasis on reliability, replaces traditional,\nwasteful, inefficient and adversarial contracting practices (Lamming 1993) and is the\nkey to unlocking the goodwill in the interdependent relationship (Lamming et al.\n2001), thus creating a frictionless flow of value-enhancing activities (Lamming 1993).\nThe aim is to use \u2018radical techniques\u2019 to do things differently and to reduce waste\n(Lamming et al 2001). Lean Supply requires the management skills to analyze, frame,\nnegotiate and manage contracts and relationships (Cox & Lamming 1997). Although\n12\nprocess efficiency is at the heart of reliability in the supply chain (Harland 1995),\nattitudinal reorientation and soft issues such as trust and commitment are essential to\nachieve the necessary step change (Lamming 1993).\nCreativity: To enhance creativity within the supply chain it has been\nrecognized for many years that a reduction in the number of suppliers is needed\nbecause maintaining close, intense relationships can be very expensive in\nmanagement effort (Cavinato 1992; Langley & Holcomb 1992). The intention is to\nwork more closely, effectively, and over the longer term (Scott & Westbrook 1991;\nPeck and J\u00fcttner 2000) with those supply chain partners who have the most critical\nimpact on the overall operation (Cooper et al. 1997). Deeper interorganizational\nalliances\/partnerships that focus on the whole supply chain can evolve, rather than\ndiluting each company\u2019s efforts through conflicting goals (Anscombe & Kearney\n1994). In fact, Bechtel & Jayaram (1997) and Perks & Easton (2000) extend this\nconcept further to suggest that SCM provides a business environment in which firms\nco-operate closely, rather than compete, to achieve mutual goals; and are incentivized\nto join in collaborative innovation (Harland 1996a). With fewer strategic partners, it is\npossible to share confidential demand information and to reduce uncertainty and\ntherefore safety stocks, lowering costs and order cycle time (Cooper & Ellram 1993;\nLamming 1993; Bechtel & Jayaram 1997). It is widely accepted that the financial\nbenefits of SCM can outweigh the additional management costs by upwards of 20%\n(Christopher 2005).\nStability: Stability requires confidence building and the synchronization of\nobjectives. Empirical evidence suggests that close long-term relationships between\n13\ncustomers and suppliers have a beneficial impact on performance. Customer and\nsupplier commit to continuous improvement and shared benefits by exchanging\ninformation openly and resolve problems by working together (Sako et al. 1994).\nLamming et al. (2001) propose that, by harnessing the unique capabilities of\npartnership, it is possible to create a shield from system-level forces. Partnership is a\ncomplex concept whose success depends upon duration to build trust (Sako et al.\n1994). When mistrust is entrenched, a shift from adversarial to co-operative\nrelationship styles is extremely difficult.\nCommunication: Effective communication (frequent, open dialogue and\ninformation sharing) is essential to supply chain success. In many cases, even where\nthe need to co-operate is recognized, tensions over the need to retain control over\ncosts, intellectual property rights and price remain (Cox & Lamming 1997). Better\ncommunication often entails joint pooling\/sharing of risk. However, risk management\nis not commonly found within the skill sets of the purchasing people who usually\nmanage business-to-business supply chain relationships (Lamming et al. 2001).\nMoreover, there are companies who view SCM as process management in their\ndealing with suppliers rather than as an exercise in relationship management. Policy is\nthereby separated from practice. Thus, conflict can occur where the customer\nunilaterally requires the supplier to reveal sensitive data. This can result in\n\u2018information impactedness\u2019, risk-hedging by providing distorted or corrupt\ninformation (Humphries & Wilding 2004). Extensive, open, honest communication is\na vital dimension not only because it acts as the oil to lubricate the working of the\npartnering process, but it also supplies the feedback that sustains and improves the\nrelationship.\n14\nHaving examined the literature in the fields of KAM and SCM to identify the\ndistinguishing relationship dimensions, we conclude that the SCM model developed\nby Humphries & Wilding may give useful insights if applied to a KAM relationship.\nThe theoretical framework and the research methodology in the following section\ndescribe how this model was applied to a key interdependent customer-supplier\nrelationship.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe research approach was dyadic and the methodology was qualitative, using\nsemi-structured interviews based on an adaptation of the Humphries and Wilding tool\nto the KAM context.\nDyadic research approach\nThe growing focus on business-to-business relationship management\nincreasingly requires research at the dyadic level, in which the unit of analysis is the\ninterface between a customer and a supplier. Dyadic research is difficult because it\nrequires deep access to both sides of a relationship, uses substantial researcher time\nand is sensitive in terms of the data revealed. However, dyadic research is a\nmethodology that can provide important insights into the detailed functioning of a\nbusiness-to-business relationship. Both KAM and SCM suffer from this lack of\ndyadic research (Christopher 1997, Cooper et al. 1997).\n15\nExploring KAM using the SCM Dimensions\nHumphries and Wilding developed a qualitative (semi-structured interview)\ndata collection instrument, which was translated into the KAM context by academic\nexperts for this research. Then, the instrument was validated both by a focus group of\nKAM practitioners drawn from four international blue chip companies and by a panel\nof academics. Minor changes to the language, but not to the meaning, of the open\nsemi-structured interview questions were made at both stages.\nUnit of analysis\nThe dyadic unit of analysis was the relationship between 2 large civil\nengineering companies: the customer (C) which designs, delivers and supports\ninfrastructure from local technical services to international landmark projects; and the\nsupplier (S) which specializes in planning, design and management services on\nprojects worldwide. This relationship was selected for analysis because of its size,\nimportance to both parties, duration, relationship type, and because there was a shared\ndiscussion about how the relationship could be improved and a willingness to explore\nkey issues on both sides. The annual value of their relationship was approximately\n$100m. The relationship was of the interdependent1 type (McDonald, Rogers and\nWoodburn 2000) and had been at this stage for just under four years. This relationship\nwas very important to both parties, but was not exclusive. However, it was complex\nand multi-level. Both parties wanted to put the relationship on a new footing. They\nhad built up considerable experience of working together but wanted to enact\n16\nrelationship management practices that would allow them to bid jointly for new\ninternational contracts.\nResearch participants and protocol\nThe research took a cross-sectional perspective of the relationship dyad using\nrespondents from different levels and roles drawn from both companies in order to\nmake a statement about the outcomes of broadly comparable experiences. We used an\nexpert sample approach to the identification of research participants in which we\nasked the companies to choose those staff who were knowledgeable about the\nrelationship; that is, in frequent, detailed contact with the other company and in post\nfor at least 6 months. We collected data from 15 respondents from each company,\nusing an interviewer and a separate analyst.\nThe research protocol used semi-structured interviews employing the\nfollowing prompts to give some structure to the discussions:\nCreativity \u2013 promoting quality, innovation, flexibility, opportunity-seeking\nproblem-solving, a long-term approach and encouraging high performance\nSuccess: What factors stimulate the achievement of creativity in the\nrelationship?\nFailure: What factors prevent the achievement of creativity in the\nrelationship?\nStability \u2013 strategic understanding, synchronisation of objectives, investment in\nrelationship-building assets eg. people, infrastructure, IT, training\nSuccess: What factors provide a stable business framework in this\nrelationship?\n1 Interdependent relationships are long-term, stable relationships where the seller is the preferred\nsupplier to a key customer, and that customer regards the supplier as a strategic external resource\n(McDonald, Rogers and Woodburn 2000).\n17\nFailure: What factors inhibit a stable business framework in this relationship?\nCommunication \u2013 promoting high quality, open, frequent, trustworthy\ninformation sharing\nSuccess: Describe areas where the communications in this relationship are\ngood.\nFailure: Describe areas where communications in this relationship are poor.\nReliability \u2013 establishing and managing reliable, adaptable, continuously\nimproving service and product delivery, lowering joint costs\nSuccess: What factors support the effectiveness and efficiency of operational\noutputs?\nFailure: What factors impede the effectiveness and efficiency of operational\noutputs?\nValue \u2013 incentivizing joint working and a win-win relationship, sharing benefits,\ncommitment to investment and business development\nSuccess: Why do you feel this relationship is valuable to you?\nFailure: What factors specifically undermine the value of the relationship?\nData collection and analysis\n160 key quotations \u2013 short, direct statements that made telling points - were\nselected by the researchers, stored in a database and organized for analysis by\ntheoretical dimension and relationship. The content was analyzed in two stages by the\nresearchers working independently. The inter-judge reliability was evaluated using a\npercentage of agreement measure (Zimmer and Golden 1988) and amendments were\ndiscussed and agreed.\nNext, each of the 160 quotations was carefully examined and \u2018tagged\u2019\naccording to the KAM dimensions described in the literature review. Considerable\neffort was made to ensure that, where more than one aspect was present in a\n18\nquotation, it was categorized primarily in the dominant dimension, i.e. where the\nstrength of feeling was greatest. Nevertheless, applying multiple \u2018tags\u2019 to each\nquotation where necessary provided the opportunity in the analysis to examine\nsubsidiary nuances of meaning. We also took careful account of the language used, to\nensure that strength of feeling as well as frequency of remark types was noted. We\nobserved the level of seniority of the initiators of each quotation. Finally, to test the\ncompleteness of the dimensions, the quotations were reviewed across all the\ndimensions to see whether there were any additional issues or themes that emerged.\nThe results provide a detailed description of each of the five dimensions and enable\nthe identification of some research propositions. Cross-analysis of the results across\nthe dimensions, set out in the discussion section, enabled the generation of further\nresearch propositions.\nSpecial attention was devoted to providing feedback to the research\nparticipants (individual anonymity was always preserved rigorously) by means of a\ndetailed report, presentation and feedback session following the completion of the\nresearch. The production of independent, frank relationship information was highly\nvalued by both companies where a number of internal and joint actions have targeted\nthe issues raised.\nRESULTS\nIn this section we examine the research results by KAM dimension and\nidentify research propositions. The descriptive statistics for this exercise are shown in\n19\nTable 1, where the quotations are additionally categorized as by the supplier, by the\ncustomer, and positive or critical about the relationship. Some quotations related to\nmore than one dimension, so that the totals sum to more than 160.\n- Bring in Table 1 -\nTable 1 shows that the topic of trust generated the most discussion, followed\nby communication. Flexibility was the least discussed dimension. Generally, both\nparties spoke positively about value exchange and relationship stability, although both\nparties were relatively critical about trust and communication. The supplier thought\nmore about flexibility, but the customer was considerably more vociferous than the\nsupplier on the subject of communication within the relationship.\nFurther analysis of the results and comparison with the literature enabled an\nidentification of detailed aspects of each dimension. For each dimension, we show the\ndetailed aspects, the number of mentions of each aspect, whether they were made by\nthe supplier or the customer side, and whether they were positive or negative in tone.\nIn addition, we provide illustrative quotations from the extensive data set to explicate\nkey points. For each quotation, we indicate whether it originated from the supplier\nfirm (S) or the customer firm (C).\nValue Exchange\nTable 2 analyses the various aspects of value exchange.\n20\n- Bring in Table 2 -\nResponses around value exchange focused on satisfaction \/ relationship\nquality. The overall balance of comments concerning satisfaction \/ relationship quality\nwas similar although attitudes were mixed, perhaps because of the important role of\ninterpersonal dynamics:\n\u201c\u2026the quality of the corporate relationship depends very much on the quality\nand commitment of the individuals concerned. One bad apple can easily undo the\noutcome\u2026\u201d (C)\nThe supplier respondents exhibited greater concern about power balance:\n\u201cOn previous projects we have worked well as a team\u2026 however, there is still\nan element of being a sub-contractor rather than a true partner\u201d (S)\n. Although throughout we used non-value-laden open interview questions to\nprompt respondents, an unexpected outcome of this approach when exploring value\nexchange was the almost complete dearth of discussion about the financial aspects of\nthe relationship. Although our sample did not include any Finance managers, it did\ninclude a Commercial manager and two senior directors who would presumably all be\ninterested in the financial outcomes. It is likely that the financial value of the\nrelationship was assumed; certainly, the relationship attracted considerable high-level\ncommitment on both sides. Thus, our first research proposition:\n21\nProposition 1: In close KAM relationships, positive financial value creation is\nassumed. In these circumstances, value exchange is viewed in terms of satisfaction,\nrelationship quality, and power balance.\nInterestingly, high-level commitment to the relationship was not always\nreflected at the operational managerial level. There was a distinct \u2018gradient\u2019 in this\nrelationship. The commitment to the relationship of the top people in both\norganizations hadn\u2019t always filtered down to the people on the ground:\n\u201cThere was definitely a spark; especially amongst the higher levels\u2026it was\nmuch less so, lower down\u201d (S)\n\u201cThere is a genuine\u2026 desire to develop the relationship, but this doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily permeate throughout the whole of the organization\u201d (C)\nTrust and Reliability\nTrust concerns were the most frequently-mentioned and strongly voiced issues\nin this KAM relationship. The findings on trust led us to redefine this dimension as\n\u2018trust and reliability\u2019 because so many of the comments concerned reliability,\ndependability, consistency and keeping promises (Table 3).\n- Bring in Table 3 -\nProcess issues and matters relating to project and supply chain management\nreceived the main attention here, often in negative terms:\n22\n\u201cThe lack of a single project management system meant a lot of time and\nmoney was spent unnecessarily and it might have caused project delays and\nfirefighting\u201d (S)\nThus, we have:\nProposition 2: Trust and reliability in KAM relationships is positively related\nto process development and risk reduction. High levels of trust and reliability result in\nlower costs, increased co-operation, and greater speed of results.\nSeveral other aspects of trust and reliability were mentioned. The balance of\ncomments tended towards the negative, interesting in such a close relationship,\nalthough both sides agreed in commenting generally favorably on risk reduction:\n\u201cThere was nervousness rather than lack of trust. I always have to remember\nthat, however good the relationship, one day the tiger may turn and bite my hand off.\u201d\n(S)\nAn additional aspect, missing skills, was raised, although this seemed to be\nspecific to a particular concern that had arisen recently in this relationship following\nthe departure of a key individual.\nFlexibility\n23\nWith the exception of geographical advantage and with the addition of team\nworking, the flexibility dimension was well supported overall by clear and intense\nrespondent sentiments (Table 4).\n- Bring in Table 4 -\nThe supplier was particularly positive about flexibility, indicating that it saw\nitself as highly flexible. The customer responses were more equally balanced between\npositive and negative. It was the supplier that took the lead in developing closer ties:\n\u201cEveryone is keen to work together on the next job, having learned previous\nlessons\u201d (S)\n\u201c\u2026 we worked well together, with a free flow of ideas between the parties\u201d\n(S)\nThus:\nProposition 3: The supplier in a KAM relationship will feel the need to be\nmore flexible and more proactive than the customer will.\nAn interesting finding relating to flexibility was that sometimes one side did\nnot feel appreciated for what it did. Moreover, it was possible to be too fast in\nanticipating customer needs:\n\u201cThey are sometimes too helpful in trying to anticipate our needs without\ntalking things through. Delays have been caused\u201d (C)\n24\nRelationship stability\nThe notion of relationship stability surfaced a number of issues (Table 5).\nThere were a series of comments about the long-term relationship which were,\nwithout exception, positive on both sides.\n- Bring in Table 5 -\nOverall, the customer side expressed considerably stronger positive comments\nabout relationship stability, suggesting differential benefits from this dimension of the\nrelationship; thus:\nProposition 4: Customers in a close KAM relationship benefit more from\nrelationship stability than suppliers in such relationships do.\nHowever, respondents expressed some major concerns about risk in the\nrelationship. Risk here related to possible \u2018relationship breakers\u2019, as opposed to the\npsychological risks identified under the Trust and Reliability dimension. The\ncustomer\u2019s view was that the supplier\u2019s internal program and budget management\nwere not good:\n\u201cThe way we jointly handle risk has changed\u2026 this is still a difficult issue and\nsubject to continuing debate over burden-sharing, but we are making progress\u201d (C)\n25\nIn turn, the supplier blamed the customer for making changes to projects that\nentailed more work and hence program and budget problems.\nCommunication\nThere were far more negative than positive comments about communication,\nparticularly from customer side respondents, perhaps surprising in this close\nrelationship (Table 6).\n- Bring in Table 6 \u2013\nIt is possible that the very closeness of the relationship made the trust and\ncommunications issues more visible:\n\u201cWe had to provide status information throughout but received very little\nback\u201d (S)\n\u201cWe could not agree a shared web-based system to handle data. The resultant\ninformation system was cumbersome, caused delays, things got lost, were incomplete,\nlacked tracking and lacked feedback\u201d (C)\nNotably, the customer viewed internal communications within the supplier,\nrather than communications between the two firms, as a major problem. The customer\nstated that problems had been caused by the supplier\u2019s failure to co-ordinate its\ndifferent departments and teams:\n26\n\u201cWe have a criticism of poor communication between their design teams,\nwhich are spread over four different locations\u201d (C)\nWhilst previous research has stressed the multiple interorganizational\ncommunications links characteristic of KAM (McDonald and Rogers 1998; Hausman\n2001; Woodburn and McDonald 2001), little attention has been paid to\nintraorganizational communication issues. In KAM relationships, the customer is so\nclose to the supplier that failure to co-ordinate internal communications will be\nnoticed by the customer and may impact on the relationship.\nThus, we have:\nProposition 5: The better the intrafirm communication within the two parties\nto a KAM relationship, the higher the perceived (interfirm) relationship success.\nWithin this overall proposition, we note that a possible explanation for the\ndifferential communication that we observed is a differential level of commitment to\nthe relationship:\n\u201cThere is definitely a difference between the appreciation shown by managers,\nand the lower levels (where the perception was you\u2019re there to serve them and you do\nwhat they tell you to do \u2013 you are not a partner)\u201d (S)\n\u201cThe management teams have bought into the culture change but it has not\nbeen communicated down effectively\u201d (C):\n27\nThus:\nProposition 6a: Senior managers have higher degrees of commitment to KAM\nrelationships than do managers at operational organizational levels.\nProposition 6b: Operational level managers exhibit greater suspicion and more\ntraditional attitudes towards the KAM relationship than more senior managers do.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of the research have implications for theory and for the practice of\nKAM. The implications for theory relate to the application of a supply chain model to\nKAM, the identification and testing of KAM relationship dimensions, and the\ngeneration of research propositions for further research in this area. The implications\nof our research for key account managers relate to the analysis and management of the\nKAM relationship.\nImplications for Theory\nA contribution of our research is to confirm the overlap between SCM and\nKAM and to demonstrate the extent of that overlap. Table 7 illustrates the extent of\nthe overlap, showing the supply chain dimensions and their aspects identified by\nHumphries and Wilding and the KAM dimensions and aspects identified by the\ncurrent research.\n- Bring in Table 7 -\n28\nBy establishing a linkage between the supply chain relationship dimensions\nand those of KAM, this research has provided new insights into the dynamics of\nKAM relationships and their management. Our work suggests some dimensions that\nmay be of importance to both customers and suppliers in making such relationships\nwork; although the clarification of these dimensions, their interrelationships and their\ncomplexity require further study.\nA cross-dimensional analysis of the results produced two interrelated themes:\nrisk; and benefits, from the relationship.\nRisk was discussed in the context of both Trust and Reliability, and of\nRelationship Stability, and was a recurring undercurrent across the dimensions. Some\nconcerns about loss of control were expressed. Yet, controls were deliberately relaxed\nin this relationship to enable the relationship to function more effectively. The results\nwere more efficient, but over-budget, joint operations. Thus, an additional set of\nresearch propositions relate to risk:\nProposition 7a: The interdependence in KAM relationships exposes each\nparty to additional risk caused by changes within the partner company.\nWithin the overall category of risk, the cross-dimension analysis enabled us to\nidentify some specific issues. The relationship studied here is particularly interesting\nbecause it had become strained. This enabled us to observe that the control and\nmanagement of communication, in particular, suffered as the relationship worsened:\n29\nProposition 7b: Increased strain in a relationship results in poorer interfirm\ncommunication.\nOverruns of cost or time were mentioned in the context of Trust and\nReliability, Flexibility, Relationship Stability and Communication. Interestingly, cost\noverruns seemed to place more strain on the relationship than time overruns did. Time\noverruns caused irritation, but cost overruns caused major problems:\n\u201cWhen costs increased significantly, this put great pressure on the relationship\nprocess.\u201d (C)\nThus:\nProposition 7c: Cost overruns are more damaging to KAM relationships than\ntime overruns are.\nThe cross-dimensional contexts in which respondents discussed risk were\nfrequently related to issues about the benefits of the relationship. The link between\ntrust and business performance is unproven (Sin et al. 2002) but there may be an\nassociation between trust, risk and control. Both sides talked about new \u201chard, back-\nto-back\u201d ways that had developed within the relationship to handle risk, and the\nimportance of positive management of benefits:\n\u201cThe benefits of our relationship diminished because they were not\nmanaged.\u201d (C)\n30\nThis leads us to propose three benefit management and risk mitigation\npropositions:\nProposition 8a: Benefits sharing arrangements between the two parties to a\nKAM relationship reduce the risks involved to both parties.\nProposition 8b: Benefits sharing agreements help align the objectives of the\ntwo parties to a KAM relationship.\nProposition 8c: Benefits sharing agreements increase the benefits of a KAM\nrelationship to both parties.\nImplications for Key Account Managers\nIn this case study, the research tool was used to support relationship managers\nin a substantial customer\/supplier relationship and, when the results were presented to\nrepresentatives of both the companies in a workshop session, they provided positive\nfeedback characterized by the following quotations:\n\u201cThe assessment exercise made us consider aspects of the supplier\u2019s position\nfrom his viewpoint.\u201d (C)\n\u201cThe process gave us a clear perspective of how to manage (or not!) a highly\ncomplex relationship. In the past we have just concentrated on detailed project\nobjectives.\u201d (S)\nBoth firms indicated that they intended to repeat the research process in the\nfuture to see how their relationship management was developing.\n31\nThere have subsequently been substantial developments in the participating\ncompanies that illustrate the usefulness of this tool to key account managers in a\nbusiness-to-business service industry setting. The supplier was able to use the\nresearch to justify retaining and even strengthening its KAM program in the face of\nskepticism from a new senior manager, thus defending the relationship against short-\nterm pressures. The customer discovered that its different divisions had different\napproaches to their relationship with this key supplier and has initiated a program to\ndraw these together throughout the company. A director has been given the\nresponsibility of coordinating the relationship. Further, the customer has engaged in\nfurther research to explore whether it should itself adopt KAM.\nOur research has several implications for practitioners. Firstly, relationship\nmanagement (beyond traditional project management) is important if the potential\nvalue in the relationship is to be realized. Secondly, relationships can be improved\nthrough a formal evaluation. Third, trust and reliability is the most important issue in\ninterdependent KAM relationships, and the key account manager should focus on\nprocess development and supply chain issues in particular to help develop trust\nbetween the two parties. Fourth, communication is a vitally important role that the key\naccount manager can take on, not just between but also within his or her firm. The\ncloser the KAM relationship, the more likely it is that the client will notice\nshortcomings in internal communications within its key suppliers. Fifth, effective\nKAM requires not only high-level support, but also operational buy-in from people\nlower down the organization. Finally, risk and benefits need positive management\n32\nwithin the relationship, perhaps involving processes such as joint planning and the\nalignment of objectives to enable both sides to capture value from a relationship.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis paper is the first to explore the increasing overlap between KAM and\nsupply chain management along some key relational dimensions. Value exchange,\ntrust and reliability, flexibility, relationship stability and communication are\ndescriptors of both business-to-business supply chain relationships and key account\nmanagement.\nHowever, the results must be viewed in the context of a single business\nservices relationship where the customer did not have an established KAM structure.\nIt is recognized that, in a single case, there is a danger that extraneous influences may\nimpact on collection and interpretation of the data. Although there appeared to be\nsupport for the dimension mapping approach taken, further testing is needed to refine\nit. For example, the KAM dimensions identified may not be exhaustive. Moreover,\nthe dimensions were treated as discrete and independent. Clearly, KAM relationships\nare complex, and the characterization using five separate variables may be an\noversimplification. Further research is required to explore whether the dimensions are\nindependent or related variables. Nevertheless, the research has demonstrated both\ntheoretical and managerial contributions in the important field of relationship\nmanagement.\n33\nREFERENCES\nAnscombe, Jonathan and Andrew T.
