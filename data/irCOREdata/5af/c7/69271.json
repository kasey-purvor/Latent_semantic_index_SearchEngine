A clear understanding of these\nconsequences is currently lacking for both secondary\n(Brook et al. 2006, Gardner et al. 2007) and plantation\nforests (Hartley 2002, Lindenmayer & Hobbs 2004),\nwhich are both increasing in importance within tropical\nforest landscapes (Evans & Turnbull 2004, Neeff et al.\n2006).\nWhilemost studies to date have focused on charismatic\nindicator or flagship groups such as birds and mammals,\n\u2217 Corresponding author. Email: j.hawes@uea.ac.uk\nattention is now expanding to a wider range of taxa\n(Barlow et al. 2007, Gardner et al. 2008). Insects make\nan enormous contribution to both tropical diversity\n(Lewinsohn et al. 2005) and ecosystem functioning\n(Wilson1987), andmoths are one of the groups playing a\ncentral role in numerous ecosystem processes as prey,\nherbivores and pollinators (Barlow & Woiwod 1989,\nJanzen 1987).\nRelatively few studies of tropical moth faunas have\nbeen conducted in the neotropics (Brehm et al. 2003,\nHilt et al. 2006, Ricketts et al. 2001) despite higher\nspecies richness in this region than elsewhere in the\ntropics (Hilt & Fiedler 2005). There is also a current lack\nof understanding regarding the relative importance of\nlocal forest type versus landscape features of the wider\ncountryside in determining patterns of diversity (but see\n282 JOSEPH HAWES ET AL.\nFigure 1.Map of the Jari landholding in the northern Brazilian Amazon and locations of the 15 sites within areas of primary forest, secondary forest\nand Eucalyptus urograndis plantations where moth sampling was carried out between April and May 2005. Labels refer to the individual sites listed\nin Table 1.\nRicketts et al. 2001). This study is one of the first to\nexamine the diversity patterns of lowland Amazonian\nmoth assemblages in a human-dominated landscape\nincluding primary, secondary and plantation forests.\nWe sampled three families differing in their ecology\nand life-histories (Hilt & Fiedler 2006, Janzen 1984):\nthe large-bodied emperor moths (Saturniidae) and hawk\nmoths (Sphingidae), as well as the smaller-bodied tiger\nmoths (Arctiidae). By assessing changes in abundance,\nspecies richness and community composition, this\nstudy examined the various effects of landscape-level\ndisturbance on moth assemblages. We tested the a priori\nhypotheses that (1) disturbed forest types (secondary\nforests and Eucalyptus plantations) support distinct and\nless species-rich moth communities than primary forest,\nand (2) that responses to disturbance vary betweenmoth\nfamilies as a result of differences in life-history strategies\ne.g. mobile, long-lived taxa are predicted to persist better\nin disturbed forest types.\nMETHODS\nStudy sites\nSampling was conducted in the 1.7-Mha landholding\nof Jar\u0131\u00b4 Celulose S.A., located on the border between\nthe states of Amapa\u00b4 and Para\u00b4 in northern Brazilian\nAmazonia (0\u25e653\u2032S, 52\u25e636\u2032W; Figure 1). The area was\npurchased in 1967, and about 10% of the land converted\nto exotic tree plantations. Current stands consist of\nEucalyptus urograndis, while earlier plantations ofGmelina\narborea and Pinus caribaea have mostly been cleared\nand abandoned. This process has resulted in a complex\nlandscape mosaic of Eucalyptus plantations, with large\ntracts of regenerating secondary forest and relatively\nundisturbed primary forest. We sampled the moth\ncommunity at 15 sites (Figure 1; Table 1), comprising\nfive of each of the three forest types: (1) undisturbed\nprimary forest; (2) even-aged native secondary forest\nAmazonian moths in secondary and plantation forests 283\nTable 1.

Sites were selected to\nminimize age differences within each forest type, and\nto maximize their area (mean size of Eucalyptus and\nsecondary forest blocks was 1687 ha (range = 574\u2013\n3910 ha) and 2682 ha (range = 1079\u20133508 ha),\nrespectively) and spatial independence (mean distance\nbetween primary, secondary and Eucalyptus sites was\n30km (range=14\u201367km), 9 km (range=4\u201344km) and\n11km (7\u201350km), respectively). Samplingwas conducted\nbetween 1 April and 18 May 2005, during the wet\nseason (January\u2013June). Average annual rainfall at Jari\nis 2115mm, and the mean daily air temperature is 26 \u25e6C\n(Coutinho & Pires 1996).\nMoth sampling\nTo sample moths we used a 2 \u00d7 2-m sheet trap design\n(Chey et al. 1997), which has the advantages over more\nstandard light-traps (Intachat & Woiwod 1999) of a\nselective catch, reduced damage to trapped individuals,\nand portability (Axmacher & Fiedler 2004). We placed\na standardized set of three light-traps at 200-m intervals\nalong the line transects of each site.A12-WUVblacklight\ntube was used at the central light-trap and a 160-W\nmercury-vapour light bulb at the two outermost traps.\nFor an overview of light-trapping feasibility see Beck &\nLinsenmair (2006).\nThe effective \u2018radius of attraction\u2019 of light-traps (Beck\n& Linsenmair 2006), is dependent upon sex and species\nidentity (Baker & Sadovy 1978) as well as light intensity\nandwavelength (Muirhead-Thomson1991).Whilemost\nevidence suggests an attraction radius of 50\u2013200 m\n(Ricketts et al. 2001), Baker & Sadovy (1978) report\ndistances up to 500 m. To minimize the capture of\nvagrants from surrounding forest types, all three light-\ntrapswere located in the centre of each forest patch and at\nleast500mfromanyedgewithneighbouring forest types.\nThe radial extentof lightdiffusion througheachstandwas\nalso estimated for each trap by measuring the maximum\ndistance intwodiametricallyoppositedirections forwhich\nany light could be detected by eye.\nTraps were operated from 18h30 to 06h30, and\nchecked simultaneously every hour by JEH and two\ntrained assistants. Arctiidae, Saturniidae and Sphingidae\nmoths were collected manually from both sides of the\nsheets and the immediately surrounding areas, using a\nkilling bottle charged with ethyl acetate. The 15 sites\nwere sampled twice each, with one repeat in each of two\nrotations (mean interval between consecutive samples\nat the same site \u00b1 SD = 27.6 \u00b1 9.9 d, N = 15 sites),\nresulting in a total sampling effort of 30 trap-nights (two\ntrap-nights or 24 trap-hours per site). The sampling order\nof sites within each rotation was controlled to account\nfor the fraction of the moon illuminated (http:\/\/aa.\nusno.navy.mil\/data\/docs\/MoonPhase.html) and to avoid\nany systematic bias from thewell-documented influences\n284 JOSEPH HAWES ET AL.\nof weather on light-trap captures (Fry & Waring 2001,\nSpalding&Parsons2004,Yela&Holyoak1997). Catches\nwere also restricted to periods without strong moonlight\nby avoiding nine nights around the full moon (Yela &\nHolyoak 1997), and weather conditions were recorded\nevery hour during sampling. Bulbs were protected\nfrom above but any broken by rain were immediately\nreplaced.\nCollected moths were oven-dried and identified at the\nEntomology Department of the Instituto Nacional de\nPesquisasdaAmazo\u02c6nia (INPA) inManaususing the INPA\nreference collection and available guides (d\u2019Abrera 1995,\n1998; Kitching & Cadiou 2000, Lemaire 1988, Pin\u02dcas-\nRubio & Pesa\u00b4ntez 2000, Pin\u02dcas-Rubio et al. 2000, http:\/\/\nwww.inra.fr\/Internet\/Produits\/PAPILLON\/arct_guy\/ar\nct_guy.htm). Morphospecies were identified by INPA\nstaff using anatomical features and wing patterns, with\ncare taken to minimize over-splitting as a result of sexual\ndimorphism or natural variation. Specimens of all species\nandmorphospecieswere subsequently deposited at INPA.\nVegetation sampling\nTrees and woody lianas were sampled along the same\ntransect lines in each of the 15 sites. We measured all\nstanding trees\u2265 10 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh)\nand lianas \u2265 5 cm in a 10 \u00d7 1000-m plot established at\neach of the 10 primary and secondary forest sites. Basal\narea in plantations was estimated from 23 10-m radial\nplots per site (7226 m2) and converted to basal area per\nhectare. Density of saplings (taller than 1m and< 10 cm\ndbh), and lianas (< 5 cm dbh) were determined by\nrecording all stems within three 2.5 \u00d7 2.5-m (6.25 m2)\nsubplots placed at 23 locations every 50 m along each\ntransect (total of 69 subplots per site).\nCanopy cover and understorey density were measured\nat each light trap location following the methodology\nof Barlow et al. (2002). A reading with a spherical\ndensiometer (Lemmon 1957) was taken in each of the\nfour compass directions and averaged before converting\nto a percentage canopy cover. Similarly, a 2.5-m graded\npole was used to estimate understorey density. In each\nof the four compass directions, the number of 10-cm\nsections visible from a distance of 15 m, were recorded\nand converted to a percentage density.\nLand-cover analysis\nA geographic information system (GIS) was employed to\nmeasure the relative extent of different forest types in\nthe immediate surroundings of any given site. A land-\ncover classification was developed from a combination\nof land-use data provided by Jari Celulose S.A and a\nsemi-supervised classification of a 2003 Landsat 7 (30-m\npixel) image. Buffer ringswere created around the central\npoint of each moth sampling site before performing an\nintersect overlay with layers containing data on land-\ncover types. Three kilometres was selected as the buffer\nradius as this exceeds the expected attraction of light-\ntraps (Baker & Sadovy 1978), yet falls within the flight\ncapacity range of large-bodied moths (I. Kitching pers.\ncomm.).\nStatistical analyses\nTotal moth abundances per trap-night were compared\nbetween each forest type using one-way ANOVAs\nwith Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. To highlight the variable\neffectiveness of light-traps in different vegetation types\n(e.g. the greater light penetration distance in Eucalyptus\nplantations compared with the dense undergrowth of\nsecondary forests) we repeated these analyses with\nabundance per trap-night divided by the area effectively\nsurveyed by each light-trap (calculated from our trap-\nradius measurements).\nThere is currently no general consensus on an\noptimal method to deal with the difficult problem of\nvariable attraction radii for light-traps in different forest\ntypes (Beck & Linsenmair 2006). Human perception of\ntrap-attraction differs from moths so ideally UV light\npenetrationwouldbemeasured,Mark-Release-Recapture\nexperiments would be performed and standardization\nwould also account for the three-dimensional catchment\nof each trap. However, we feel that the simple\nstandardization we performed indicates the possible\nimpacts of variable vegetation density and emphasizes\nthat crude abundances should be interpreted with\ncaution.\nFor assessing species richness and alpha diversity, the\nraw catch data were pooled from the three individual\ntraps fromboth nights at a given site, as sample sizeswere\ninsufficient to compare the relative attractions of lamps\nwith different spectral emissions. The observed number\nof species per site gives a poor and often misleading\nindication of total richness because of the virtual\nimpossibility of obtaining a complete inventory of species-\nrich tropical invertebrate communities (Price et al.1995).\nMore suitable estimates are given by the extrapolation of\nspecies accumulation curves or the shape of the species-\nabundance distribution (Magurran 2004). Rarefaction\nand non-parametric estimators also provide powerful\napproaches to estimate species richness (Gotelli & Colwell\n2001). Sample-based rarefaction curves were therefore\nproduced for the three forest types, and an average\nof three abundance based estimators (Chao1, Jack1\nand ACE) was calculated for each site using EstimateS\n7.5 (R. K. Colwell, http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/estimates).\nAmazonian moths in secondary and plantation forests 285\nSpecies-abundance relationships were examined using\nstandardized Whittaker plots. To assess alpha diversity\nwe calculated Fisher\u2019s alpha of the logarithmic series\ndistribution (Fisher et al. 1943), which has been widely\nused in tropical moth diversity studies and is relatively\nindependent of sample size (Magurran 2004).\nPatterns of community structure and composition\namong different sites and between forest types were\nvisualized using non-metric multidimensional scaling\n(NMDS) of a similarity matrix based on the Bray\u2013\nCurtis index (standardized and square root-transformed).\nThe analyses were performed on both abundance\n(quantitative) and presence\/absence (qualitative) data.\nAbundance data reveal patterns based primarily on the\ncommon species (i.e. community structure), whereas\npresence\/absence data give more weight to the\ndistribution of rare species (i.e. community composition).\nDifferences between forest types were assessed using\nan analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), and the identity\nof species contributing most to any differences was\ndetermined using an analysis of percentage similarities\n(SIMPER) (Clarke &Warwick 2001).\nThe influence of the forest type surrounding study sites\nwas investigated using a Spearman\u2019s correlation of the\namount of primary forest within a 3-km buffer against\nrarefied species richness. The effects of surrounding\nprimary forest plus other environmental parameters\n(lunar phase, weather conditions and forest structure),\nas well as the geographic distance between sites on\ncommunity structure were assessed using the BIOENV\nand RELATE (analogous to a Mantel test) functions\nrespectively. Community analyses were conducted using\nPrimer 5 (PRIMER-E Ltd., Plymouth, UK).\nRESULTS\nMoth abundance and species richness\nAtotalof1848moth individualswerecollectedduring the\n30 trap-nights at 15 sites. These comprised 974Arctiidae\nindividuals of 231 species, 772 Saturniidae individuals of\n65 species, and 102 Sphingidae individuals of 39 species.\nOf these,452Arctiidaeand11Saturniidaewere identified\nto 160 and six morphospecies respectively. Sample sizes\nin this short-term study were therefore relatively small,\nparticularly for the Sphingidae. For a full species list see\nAppendix 1 (supplementary material).\nTotal abundance of the three moth families ranged\nfrom 42 to 264 individuals per site. The abundance\npatterns for each family closely resemble the pattern\nfor the three families combined where mean abundance\nper trap-night differed significantly among forest types\n(Figure 2; ANOVA: F2,87 =5.8, P=0.004), with fewer\nmoths captured in secondary forests than in either\nprimary forests or Eucalyptus plantations. With the\noverall abundance of trap-night samples standardized\nin relation to the light-trap areas there were still\nsignificant differences among forest types (Figure 2; F2,87\n= 8.6, P<0.001) but this standardized catch was lower\nin Eucalyptus plantations than in either primary and\nsecondary forests.Again, this patternwas similar for each\nfamilyseparately,althoughdifferencesamongforest types\nwere not as clear for the Sphingidae.\nRarefaction curves for all three families combined\nshowed slightly higher levels of species richness in\nsecondary forest and Eucalyptus plantations than in\nprimary forest, although the differences between all three\nforest types were only marginally significant (Figure 3).\nThis pattern was driven mainly by the pattern within\nArctiidae, while Saturniidae showed a lower species\nrichness in Eucalyptus plantations than primary and\nsecondary forest. There were no differences between\nforest types for Sphingidae, where the sample sizes were\nsmallest.\nComparing observed species richness with the average\nrichness estimate shows that a complete inventory was\nnot achieved for any family in any of the three forest\ntypes (Table 2). Values for Fisher\u2019s alpha did not differ\nsignificantly between forest types for the three families\ncombined or within each family (Table 2). No difference\nbetween forest types was evident in the proportions of\nlocal singletons captured at a site for the three families\ncombined (F2,12 = 2.2, P=0.152).\nCommunity structure and composition\nLevels of dominance were similar in the three forest\ntypes with long tails of rare species in each case.\nWhen examining only the 25 most abundant species\nin each forest type (Figure 4), secondary forests appear\nto exhibit the lowest levels of dominance, with most of\nthe dominance in primary forest accounted for by just\none species, Evius albicoxae (108 individuals from 677\nprimary forest captures). However, few of the 25 most\nabundant species in primary forest were also the most\nabundant species in secondary forests or Eucalyptus\nplantations, indicating a high level of community\nturnover.\nThis is supported by the two-dimensional NMDS\nordination plot based on abundance data for the three\nfamilies combined, which shows a distinct grouping of\nsites into the three forest types (Figure 5; Global ANOSIM:\nR=0.75, P=0.001) and significant differences between\neach pair of forest types (Pairwise ANOSIM between\nprimary (PF), secondary forest (SF) and Eucalyptus\nplantation (EUC): PF-SF (i.e. between primary and sec-\nondary forests): R=0.64, P=0.008; PF-EUC: R=0.96,\nP=0.008; SF-EUC: R=0.58, P=0.008).

This was also confirmed by\na two-way crossed analysis of similarities that shows a\ndifference in community structure between forest types\nwhilst averaging across sampling rounds (ANOSIM: R =\n0.49, P=0.001).\nBeta diversity (Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity) values\nwere highest between primary forest and Eucalyptus\nplantations (84%) but all forest types supported largely\nunique communities (Figure 6), with five species\ncontributing 9\u201311% of the total dissimilarity in each\npairwise forest comparison (Table 3). Primary forest sites\nwere distinct largely due to (1) an abundance of species\nrarely found in disturbed forest types (Evius albicoxae and\nAdeloneivia subangulata) and (2) lower relative densities\nor absence of species common in secondary forests\n(e.g. Dirphia tarquina and Periga cynira) and Eucalyptus\nplantations (e.g. Automeris liberia and Idalus admirabilis)\n(Table 2).\nResponses to forest type and landscape structure\nThe BIO-ENV analysis identified canopy cover as the\nbest single predictor of moth community structure when\nexamining all forest types combined (Table 4). Basal\narea of lianas and basal area of live trees were the best\npredictors in primary and secondary forests respectively,\nwhereas the moth community structure in plantation\nsites was strongly correlated to the attraction radius\nof the light-traps, which was significantly negatively\ncorrelated with both understorey density (r = \u20130.862,\nP<0.001) and canopy cover (r = \u20130.921, P<0.001).\nThe amount of primary forest within 3 km was not\nidentified as a strong predictor in the BIO-ENV analysis\nandgeographicdistancebetweensiteswasalsonotrelated\nto patterns of community dissimilarity (RELATE: Rho= \u2013\n0.09, P=0.738). There was no difference in the lunar\nphase across forest types (mean fraction of the moon\nvisible per night; F2,30 = 0.564, P=0.583).\n288 JOSEPH HAWES ET AL.\nTable 2.Detailed results of the sampling for Arctiidae, Saturniidae and Sphingidae at the 15 light-trapping siteswithin primary (PF) and secondary\nforests (SF), and Eucalyptus plantations (EUC).

Light-trapping for nocturnal\nArctiidae, Saturniidae and Sphingidae in the Jari\nlandscape of Brazilian Amazonia revealed three major\npatterns: (1) undisturbed primary forests were not\ndistinctly richer or more diverse than secondary forests\nor Eucalyptus plantations, but each forest type exhibited\na distinct community in terms of both structure and\ncomposition; (2) species turnover was highest between\nprimary forests and Eucalyptus plantations (highest beta\ndiversity), with secondary forest sites being intermediate;\n290 JOSEPH HAWES ET AL.\nFigure 5. Biotic NMDS ordination from species abundances of Arctiidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae and all families combined, from 15 sites in primary\n(PF) and secondary forest (SF), and Eucalyptus plantation (EUC).\nand (3) the three moth families varied in their response\nto disturbance in terms of species richness but changes\nin abundance and community structure were relatively\nconsistent.\nAbundance and species richness in primary, secondary and\nplantation forests\nTotal captures of Sphingidaeweremuch lower than those\nin the other families sampled in this study (Arctiidae and\nSaturniidae), and they contributed little to any observed\ncommunity differences between forest types. However,\nSphingidae are not expected to be common in the dark\nprimary forest understorey (Schulze et al. 2001) andmay\nnot be sensitive to disturbance (Schulze&Fiedler2003, cf.\nBeck et al.2006). TheArctiidae sampled contain very few\nfrom subfamilies Ctenuchinae or Lithosiinae but these are\nlikely to be included in the large number identified only to\nmorphospecies.\nThe lower overall abundance of all three families\nin secondary forests could be largely attributed to the\ndilution effect on the effectiveness of light-traps as a\nresult of denser vegetation (Hilt & Fiedler 2005, Ricketts\net al. 2001). In contrast, light-traps appear especially\neffective in the relatively open Eucalyptus plantations\nin attracting moths from a larger surrounding area\nand, when standardized by trap-area, abundances were\nactually much lower in Eucalyptus plantations than\nsecondary or primary forests.\nAmazonian moths in secondary and plantation forests 291\nFigure 6.Number of species of Arctiidae, Saturniidae, Sphingidae and all families combined, captured in primary (PF) and secondary forest (SF), and\nEucalyptus plantation (EUC).\nWe are unaware of any other studies that have\nstandardized trap catches by area in terms of the effective\nvisibility of light sources but tentatively suggest that,\nfollowing experimental testing, this could be a useful\napproach to compare moth abundances in structurally\ndifferent forest types. For example, Kitching et al. (2000)\ndetected a higher abundance of Arctiidae in areas of\nsecondary forest regenerated from cleared tropical rain\nforest in Queensland, Australia. The disparity between\nthis finding and our raw abundances may be in part\ndue to effective light-trap area since our standardized\nabundances suggest a similar response. Differences\nin abundance require careful interpretation however,\nparticularly since light-trapping depends strongly on\npatterns of moth activity and other external factors\n(Butler et al. 1999, Fiedler & Schulze 2004), including\nseasonal differences in moth diversity and abundance\n(Summerville & Crist 2003), and variability in collection\nconditions (Gotelli & Colwell 2001). Although taxa\nfrom different ecological niches can exhibit variable\nresponses to anthropogenic habitat alteration (Stork\net al. 2003) the similar abundance patterns we report\nhere suggest a common response by the Arctiidae and\nSaturniidae.\nIn contrast, our species richness results do suggest\ndifferent responses between families. Conversion to\nplantation forestry has been reported to have potentially\nirreversible consequences for biodiversity (Holloway et al.\n1992, Kanowski et al. 2005), and a reduction in moth\nspecies richness in disturbed areas has been observed\nin a number of tropical forest studies (Beck et al. 2002,\nFiedler & Schulze 2004, Willott 1999). Other studies\nhave reported increases in species richness (Hilt & Fiedler\n2005) and it is important to note that these studies\nexaminedmoth familieswithwidelydiffering life-histories\n(Geometridae, Sphingidae, Arctiidae, Pyralidae).\nA \u2018life-historyhypothesis\u2019hasbeendeveloped toexplain\nthe variety of responses between and within families\n(Beck et al. 2006, Janzen 1984). Income breeders (e.g.\nSphingidae: Sphingini and Macroglossini), which feed as\nadults, are long-lived, strong-flying, and are expected to\npersist in disturbed environments. Capital breeders (e.g.\nSaturniidae), which are non-feeding as adults, have a\nshorter adult life span and are predicted to distribute\ndifferentially throughout the landscape, possibly due\nto differences in mobility and their larval food plant\nrequirements (Beck et al. 2006). Our results show some\nsupport for this hypothesis since the Sphingidae show no\ndifference in levelsof species richnessbetween forest types,\nas opposed to lower levels for Saturniidae in Eucalyptus\nplantations. However, care must be taken with this\ninterpretation, particularly because of the small sample\nsizes for Sphingidae. The higher levels of species richness\nfor Arctiidae in both secondary forest and Eucalyptus\nplantations may be explained by the wide range of life-\nhistory strategies within this family.\n292 JOSEPH HAWES ET AL.\nSome support for the life-history hypothesis is given\nby the similar patterns observed in alpha diversity. No\nsignificant differences in Fisher\u2019s alpha were detected\nbetween forest types for the families analysed either\ntogether or separately, but there were lower values\nfor Saturniidae in Eucalyptus plantations and higher\nvalues for Arctiidae in secondary forests. Other studies\nof Sphingidae responses following land-use change have\nalso found no clear differences, even with larger sample\nsizes (Beck et al.2006, Chey et al.1997), but phylogenetic\ndifferences between Sphingidae from Asia and America\nneed to be considered here (Beck & Na\u00a8ssig 2007).\nLow sample representation is commonly encountered\nin tropical insect inventories (Price et al. 1995), and\nestimates of alpha diversity in primary tropical forest\nare thus likely to be underestimates, particularly when\nsamples from the forest canopy are not included (Brehm\n2007,Dumbrell &Hill 2005,Willott 1999). Stratification\nis another important factor in determining diversity\npatterns (Hilt & Fiedler 2008) and alpha diversity\nestimates for Eucalyptus plantations may be positively\nbiased due to higher captures of the often distinct canopy\nfauna in these families (Brehm 2007, Schulze et al.\n2001). The high variability in diversity among individual\nEucalyptus sites may potentially be related to variability\nin the abundance of tourists or vagrants as well, as a\nresult of differences in the effective attraction radii of light-\ntraps (differences in understorey density) or the amount\nof primary forest in the surrounding landscape.\nTurnover in moth communities following land-use change\nHigh levels of dominance by a limited number of species\nare usually expected in more heavily disturbed sites\n(DeVries et al. 1999, Fiedler & Schulze 2004). However,\nwe did not find this pattern for the Jari landscape\nas species-abundance relationships were very similar\namong forest types and the total number of captures was\nprimarily dominated by few species in primary forest.\nPatterns of both community structure and composition\ndiffered clearly among forest types, with similar results\nfrom NMDS plots based on both abundance and\npresence\/absence data showing that these patterns are\ndriven by differences in the distribution of both rare and\ncommon species. Differences between the two sampling\nsessions at each site may be related to the adult life\nspan of moths since Saturniidae, for example, have an\nespecially short adult phase (Janzen 1984). Combined\nwith the synchronized emergence of adults, this could\ncause a relatively fast temporal turnover in species active\nwithinanyone forest type.However, the three forest types\nhad consistently distinct communities in each sampling\nsession and, despite some shared species, each forest type\nsupported a largely unique moth fauna.\nThese clear patterns representing differential distri-\nbution across the landscape were maintained when\nexamining the \u2018capital breeding\u2019 Saturniidae. Only\nprimary forest and Eucalyptus plantations held distinct\ncommunities of themainly \u2018incomebreeding\u2019 Sphingidae,\nwhile the Arctiidae, with a wide range of life-histories,\nhad distinct communities in each forest type. It would\nbe interesting to examine patterns of beta diversity in\nrelation to the \u2018life-history hypothesis\u2019 (Beck et al. 2006)\nand further variability in responses may also exist within\nsubfamilies or tribes of eachof these families (Hilt&Fiedler\n2006) but larger sample sizes would be required.\nMoth\u2013environment relationships\nBecause forest structure variables were intercorrelated,\nit is difficult to identify the most important factors\ndetermining the observed variation in community\nstructure and composition. Although canopy cover\nand basal area of trees and lianas were identified as\nimportant factors, it ismore likely that differences inmoth\nassemblages are primarily determined by the distribution\nof host-plant resources than differences in physical\nvegetation structure (Summerville & Crist 2003). Most\nmoths are herbivorous as larvae and many are noted for\ntheir pronounced host-specificity (Holloway et al. 1992).\nPlant diversity or the presence of particular plant species\nis therefore critical, both for the emergence of adults and\nfor egg-laying, but investigating the relationship between\nthe moth community structure and plant diversity is\nhindered by the very limited knowledge of resource use\nby individual moth species (Brehm et al. 2003).\nThe strong correlation between light-trap radius and\nmoth species composition in Eucalyptus plantations\nsuggests that trap-effectiveness is a critical factor in\nplantation sites (Table 4). Forest cover in the immediately\nsurrounding landscape also appears important in\ndetermining the local moth community in plantation\nsites: Area 95 and Area 127 were surrounded by the\nhighest proportionof primary forestwithina3-kmradius,\ncontained communities most similar to those in primary\nforest,andhadthehighestvaluesofalphadiversitydespite\nthe smallest light-trap areas for plantation sites.\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough this study shows that both secondary forests\nand Eucalyptus plantations are relatively species-rich and\ndiverse compared to primary forest, they each hosted a\ncommunity structureandcomposition thatwasmarkedly\ndistinct from those in primary forest. For example, half\n(51%) of the species associated with primary forest were\nentirely absent from the surrounding matrix, as primary\nAmazonian moths in secondary and plantation forests 293\nforest species became replaced by species likely to be\ngeographicallywidespreaddisturbance or edge specialists\n(Dunn 2004, Horner-Devine et al. 2003).\nThe relatively high levels of species richness\nand diversity recorded in Eucalyptus plantations and\nsecondary forest may be explained by the landscape\nheterogeneity,which isknownto increase thebiodiversity\nvalue of plantations (Kanowski et al. 2005, Lindenmayer\n& Hobbs 2004), forest fragments (Shahabuddin &\nTerborgh 1999), secondary forests and the wider\ncountryside (Horner-Devine et al. 2003). This study\nprovides some support for the life-history hypothesis\n(Beck et al. 2006) but more detail, including information\non variability within families, is required to examine\nhow species traits may interact to determine reactions\nto disturbance (Koh et al. 2004, Mattila et al. 2006).\nFinally, comparisons with patterns from other taxa\nare urgently needed to allow greater understanding of\nthe complex responses of biodiversity to landscape-level\nhabitat changes.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the Brazilian Ministerio de Ciencias e\nTecnologia (CNPq) and Ministerio do Meio Ambiente\n(MMA-IBAMA) for permission to conduct this study.\nWe are grateful to Orsa Florestal and Jari Celulose for\npermission to work on their landholding and logistical\nsupport throughout the project.
