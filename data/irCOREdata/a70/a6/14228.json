Important aspects of a research protocol include a definition of the\nresearch problem, sufficient detail about the plan of work, reasons for selecting the\nspecified approach, and information related to how research funds will be allocated. The\nscientific method implies a logical derivation of conclusions by means of inference\ncorrectly drawn from reliable data. The analysis of experimental data is, therefore, a critical\nstage in every research study and statistical tests are required for most research in the life\n83\nAlan Wise A program to help students of life sciences prepare a research protocol\nsciences and this should form an important part of the overall method described in the\nresearch protocol. Some reasons why research protocols are rejected by funding bodies can\nbe instructive at the writing stage (Gordon, 2000). Some have an error in design or\nfeasibility such that it is unlikely that the researcher would be able to draw valid\nconclusions from the data. Some do not contain enough detail on the measurement of\nvariables, the way data will be analysed, or the conceptual framework or rationale guiding\nthe research for reviewers to gauge the potential quality of the results. Sometimes there\nmay appear to be possibilities for the existence of problems with feasibility, for example the\ntime required for data collection, the lack of background of the researchers in the area of\nproposed research, or unacknowledged problems in obtaining or keeping an adequate\nnumber of research participants. This makes reviewers sceptical that the research can be\nconducted as proposed. Sometimes the research is technically sound but the problem being\ninvestigated is not very important or does not appear likely to advance significantly the\nparticular field of research. Reviewers may see problems with the logic of the research or\nthe failure to consider important alternatives to the methods proposed. A common failing\nin protocols is a lack of clarity about important aspects of the research, such as why\ncertain variables are chosen to be measured, a sketchy indication of how study subjects will\nbe chosen or where they will come from, and a vague and quite non-specific account of\nhow data will be analysed. Lack of clarity in protocols often stems from inclusion of too\nmany variables in the research. Applications that propose to collect data measuring a large\nnumber of variables often do poorly in peer review, especially if there are no specific\nhypotheses about expected group differences or a discussion of how to reduce the number\nof variables to a manageable number for statistical analysis. Such a proliferation of\nvariables often indicates a lack of thoughtful selectivity about what is really important to\ninvestigate in an area.\nAt honours level, students have to design their own research project and write a simple\nresearch protocol to convince the supervisor that the student has sufficient understanding\nto design a study that is likely to be successful. It is useful practice for the possibility that\nthe student will later be involved in actual research, to make this exercise as realistic as\npossible. In order to prompt the student to include the most important aspects of a\nresearch protocol, especially the statistical ones, a computer program has been developed.\nBecause many parts of the protocol are very dependent on the actual problem and method\nto be used, it is not clear how they can be included in a simple fashion. Some parts of the\nprotocol therefore have been excluded from this program.\nMethod\nBearing in mind the comments of reviewers of protocols it seems that the research\nhypothesis itself is a critical area for the student to focus on, and this is therefore the\nstarting point in the simulation (see Figure 1 for a flow chart of the program). At this stage,\nit seems important to bring this part of the protocol to the student's attention by providing\nsome explanation of what is involved and simply providing a box in which to type the\nhypothesis. Although this may be further developed in the final version of the protocol, a\nrelatively small box on the screen may help to focus the student's attention better than a\nblank sheet of paper.\n84\nAlt-} Volume 10 Number I\nQuestionnaire\nResearch\nhypothesis\ni\nPopulation\ni\nSampling\ni\nType of study\ni\nTreatment Relationships\n1\nType of data\nFactors \u2022\u2022-\nI f Normal\nDistribution 4-\u2014\u2022 Confounded\n->\u2022 Quantitative?

The upper frame\ncontains navigation aids employing JavaScript for selecting different parts of the notes\nprovided by lecturers in the course and other interactive material. The research protocol\nprogram appears in the lower two frames. The box for typing in the hypothesis is placed in\nthe upper of these two frames, at the top of which appears a menu bar. The whole program\nis written in JavaScript, which permits relatively advanced programming (Wise, 1999). The\ndata entered by the student is stored in variables that are defined in the parent window to\nthe two lower frames so that they are not lost as the student navigates through the site. The\nmenu bar (Hall, 2000) uses dynamic positioning and is based on a library of functions\nwritten by Isaacs (1997). Although menu bars are common in Windows programs, they are\ndifficult to achieve in Web browsers and some are specific only for Microsoft browsers; this\nversion was designed to work in both Netscape and Internet Explorer. The menu item\n'Explain' has submenus that load pages into the lower frame to explain the need for a\nresearch hypothesis, links to sites explaining research and statistics, and the help screen that\nexplains how to navigate through the program. It is only on this first screen that a 'File'\n85\nAlan Wise A program to help students of life sciences prepare a research protocol\nmenu item appears. This gives access to a procedure that saves all the variables in a cookie\nthat can be retrieved later when the student comes back to the program.\nEmpty boxes are also provided on the subsequent two screens, with explanations about\nselecting the population and sampling. The students are encouraged to consider the\npopulation for which the study is intended to be valid in as brief a description as they had\nto provide the hypothesis, again to focus their minds. Sampling techniques can also be\nrelatively simply described and a supervisor should be able to judge the appropriateness of\nthe method without requiring a long description.\nThe next screen provides an explanation of three different types of study along with three\ngraphical 'radio' buttons, only one of which can be chosen at a time. Although scientists are\ncommonly thought by the lay person to undertake experimental studies in which different\ntreatments are given, there are also two other types of research that may be involved in the\nwork of our students. Many are involved in the design of surveys involving questionnaires,\nand here the main question that needs to be resolved before statistical tests can be chosen is\nthe type of data involved. This is explained to the students on this screen and they are also\nprovided with an explanation of the null hypothesis to remind them of the way in which\nresults are statistically evaluated. All students have undertaken a course in research methods\nin the second stage to enable them to understand studies in the literature, so the protocol\nprogram is not intended to teach the students new concepts. The program writes a protocol\non the screen by incorporating the information already given by the student on the previous\nscreens and choosing an appropriate test for the type of data involved.\nrosoft Internet Explorer provided by Fieeserve\n\u00a3Je E \u00ab View Favorites look H<*\n| Stage 4 Notes Zl\\ Project Protocol _\u00bb]\nExplain\nHypothesis\nWe need to\nresearch.

You can edit as many times as you like and\ndesign different types of research. On the first page, you can save your work and retrieve it when you\nnext return to this page. After answering all the questions, you can automatically print a research\nprotocol, which is not in a finalised state, but shows the steps needed in the writing of a real protocol.\nUse the \u00bb and \u00ab signs to move forwards and backwards, respectively and \u00ab \u00ab to return to the first\npage.\nIn order to design a research protocol there are several steps that are required:\n\u2022 \\ j r i . \u2022 At \u00ab\u00ab\u2014J.1. 1 I,, j i * n\nFigure 2: The program help screen\n86\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number I\nAnother type of research involves the investigation of relationships between measure-\nments. These involve correlation and as in the previous screen, the type of data, and\npresence or absence of known confounding factors is explained on the screen to aid the\nstudent. When confounding is present, the student is advised to use partial correlation.\nThe experiment is a very common research tool in the life sciences and it was necessary to\nconstruct several more screens than for the other types of research. Experiments are\nfactorial in design, in that one or more factors will be involved, usually by altering the\ntreatment given, but sometimes by simple inclusion in the experiment of different\nindividuals based on some factor that classifies them, for example sex. Students can not\npass this screen until they have successfully entered at least the name of one factor, and\nthey can design experiments with up to three factors. For each factor, on the next screen,\nstudents have to decide how many levels of the factor they intend to include. For gender,\nthis can only be two, but when the amount of a drug is to be varied, any number could be\nchosen; again advice about this decision is provided on screen. When a professional\nresearch protocol is written, it should be an important subject to consider how many units\nare needed. On the next screen, units are defined and a simple account of how the number\nof units can be calculated to provide sufficient power for the study is given. For honours\nstudents, this section generally provides the most complex aspect of statistical analysis that\nthey will meet and mostly they are constrained by time and circumstances rather than\nbeing able to include the number of units they would genuinely need for a powerful study.\nThis screen may therefore be read, but not taken too seriously by many students. It is\nprovided for completeness and to remind the student that this issue is important, especially\nin the ethics of human experimentation (Altman, 1982). Nobody should be asked to\nundergo any but the most innocuous of procedures in student projects in the name of\nscience if the experiment is so badly designed that is has no hope of a successful\nconclusion.\nPrior to the screen that writes the protocol for factorial experiments, there are screens in\nwhich students are expected to consider the important issues of whether the design could\nbenefit from blocking to reduce unexplained variation and some procedure to randomize\nor provide an unbiased order of treatments. Here again, students are provided with boxes\nin which to type a simple explanation of the procedure to be used, such as a Latin square.\nThe independence of data is discussed on the screen and the student has to decide whether\ndata fulfils this requirement or not. The final screen explains the issues surrounding the\nnormality of the data, whether it can be transformed, or whether it is best to consider it as\nnon-parametric data. When all these issues have been resolved, the program decides what is\nthe most appropriate statistical test and includes this decision in the research protocol. The\nstudent should then be able to read up on the test and justify why it should be used in the\nfinal written protocol.\nThe program was introduced to fourth-stage students of Nutrition and Dietetics at the\nbeginning of the Research Project module and instructions were included in a handout\nthat was used for practical classes that included advanced computing related to aspects of\ntheir project. The instructions were brief, but included an example of what a student from\na previous year might have written into the boxes for her project as an example. The\nhandout contained an evaluation questionnaire with statements asking students to rate\nthem on a scale of 1-5 from strongly disagree to strongly agree, with neutral in the centre.\n87\nAlan Wise A program to help students of life sciences prepare a research protocol\nQuestionnaires were anonymously returned after students had discussed the protocol with\ntheir supervisors. The results were subjected to analysis by Chi-square test to determine\nwhether there were significant differences between answers to the questions.\nResults\nThere were 24 students in the class and 21 returned questionnaires. One of these, however,\nhad considered the program irrelevant to the project as shown by the answer to the first\nquestion and had not completed the other questions. Two other students also considered it\nirrelevant, but had nevertheless used the program and gave feedback on it, so their results\nare included in the analysis. Few students used the boxes for 'strongly agree' or 'strongly\ndisagree', so they were combined with 'agree' and 'disagree', respectively, and the results\nare given as the ratio of answers for agree: disagree; neutral scores can be calculated by\ndifference from 20. A Chi-square test showed that there were significant differences\nbetween the answers to each question (x^ odf ^3-3, P < 0.001). The most positive feature of\nthe program seen by the students was that it had 'links to useful material on the Internet'\n(17 agreed: 0 disagreed). They generally considered it 'user-friendly' (13:1) and 'clearly laid\nout and visually appealing' (13:2). There was also agreement, though less strong, that the\nprogram 'helps to clarify what is needed for my protocol' (14:4), 'provoked me to think of\naspects of the project, the importance of which I might have failed to realize early enough'\n(12:4) and 'provoked me to ask appropriate questions of my supervisor about the project'\n(10:3). Students were less likely to consider that the program 'surprised me by selecting a\nstatistical test that I had not considered' (7:4). There was also general disagreement with\nstatements that the program 'is daunting because you have to fill in empty boxes' (3:8),\n'appears to be an academic exercise that is not directly helpful for my work' (3:12) and\n'merely confirmed that I had already chosen the right statistical test' (2:10).\nDiscussion\nAlthough JavaScript is frequently considered to be a language that provides simple\nfunctions for use in Webpages, for example for sending information back to the site\noriginating the page, it is clear that it can perform complex tasks and deserves more use in\neducation (Wise, 1999). The present program includes a wide range of functions, including\nmenu bars, selecting various options in the flow of ideas and selecting an appropriate\nstatistical test. Perusal through a large bookshop shows that there are many books written\nspecifically for students in each discipline area to teach them research methods. The\nauthors clearly feel that it is important to use examples that will appear relevant to their\nstudents, whereas most statistical textbooks that may be sold to a wide range of students\nare more mathematical and provide less discipline-specific examples. Although the\nprogram was written by a nutritionist for students in that subject area, few examples in the\ntext provided to the student are overtly nutritional and students undertake a relatively wide\nrange of projects. These include surveys and laboratory experiments. From the comments\nreceived from the students, at least three of the four students undertaking projects in food\nmicrobiology considered the program irrelevant to their projects. Two of them had\nexplored the program and answered the questions, but as they still did not consider it\nrelevant, this suggests that some more steps are needed to make its relevance to\nmicrobiology clearer. In fact, when one of the students had completed the project, it was\n88\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number I\nclear that she had to use an analysis of variance and had not realized that statistics was\ninvolved in microbiology and had hence not looked at the program. Students had been\ngiven an example to fill in during their practical class that had involved an experiment\nrequiring analysis of variance, but one of the students commented that more examples\nincluding those for relationships between measurements and for questionnaires might be\nbeneficial. The feedback therefore suggests that more subject-specific examples, including\nmicrobiological ones, might improve the usefulness of the program.\nAlthough the number of students using the program was relatively small, some of the\nresults were clear enough to suggest that this approach is useful to students. It may be\nnecessary to edit it for students in different disciplines, or it might be possible if several\nsubject specialists combined their efforts to increase its breadth by including more research\npossibilities.\nPostscript\nSeveral months after completing the work described in this paper it was discovered that\nNetscape had dropped layers from its version of JavaScript so that the latest version of the\nprogram (version 6) would no longer display the menu bar. In order to maintain the\ncapacity of the protocol program to run in both browsers, it was necessary to rewrite it to\nuse simpler navigation techniques. At the same time, the opportunity was taken to tidy up\nthe program by using the facility of JavaScript to write material to each frame rather than\nrequire a large number of separate HTML files for each frame. The program is available for\nreaders to try at http:\/\/www.rgu.ac.uk\/windiets and the author will welcome comments and\nsuggestions for future collaborative research.\nReferences\nAltman, D. G.
