Moving from a career in secondary \nspecialist teaching of Physical Education and Dance, into higher education in 1981, \nTansin has continued to contribute to secondary and primary teacher training, course \ndiversification and development at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Research \ninterests have developed in aesthetic activities, notably gymnastics and dance, and \ninto \u2018life experience\u2019 research as a means of increasing understanding of particular \ncultures. An important programme developed at the University has been the ACE \/ \nB.Phil \/ MA in \u2018Applied Studies in Dance\u2019 which enables full-time dancers of \nBirmingham Royal Ballet to enter higher education on a part-time customised \nprogramme, designed around Company schedules.

The issues were foreshadowed by sociological \ntheories of the body, performance nutrition, and disordered eating. An interpretive, \ncritical research approach was used to maximise the \u2018insider perspective\u2019 of the \nresearcher, with over twenty years\u2019 experiences of the training and professional ballet \nculture. A small-scale qualitative research project aimed to capture \u2018thick description\u2019 \nand authentic accounts of the human realities of ballet culture from the inside.  \nInterview and questionnaire responses were gathered from student-dancers, \nprofessional dancers, teachers \/ managers, and medics at a UK vocational ballet \nschool and a company fed, to some extent, from that training school. Findings were \ncollated with experiential observations in the daily workplace, retrospective \nparticipant observation through personal diaries and documentation including \nbiographies and autobiographies of professional dancers.  \nFindings indicated that there is still a gap between the rhetoric of nutritional education \nand the reality of the ballet world\u2019s aesthetic and practices. \u2018Cult-like\u2019, authoritarian \nbehaviour and \u2018docile\u2019 submissive attitudes were apparent and contributed to \nproblems with self-esteem, body image and eating disorders. Whilst dancers in \ntraining were better informed, pressures related to the body inside the profession \ndominated attitudes and behaviour. The recommendations include a re-appraisal of the \nballet aesthetic and body culture in the management of the profession and more \nempowerment of dancers to encourage them to question, critique and improve the \nculture of their art form rather than merely accept its ideals and demands.   \n \n 4\nBETWEEN SCYLLA AND CHARYDBIS:  \nNUTRITIONAL EDUCATION VERSUS BODY CULTURE AND THE BALLET \nAESTHETIC: THE EFFECTS ON THE LIVES OF FEMALE DANCERS \nBody image, that is the beliefs, attitudes and values we attach to our bodies, results \nfrom socialization into particular ways of thinking and behaving, attributable to \nmultiple influences. The western twentieth century transition to the \u2018cult of \nslenderness\u2019 is evident in current media, icons and lifestyle aspirations and is fixed in \na consumer culture. (Featherstone et al 1991). The world of ballet is one of many sites \nin which this cult is reflected and the pursuit of the often unattainably thin physique, \nby women in particular, has been identified as an issue of increasing concern. It does \nnot exist in isolation but as part of similar concerns, both in society generally, and \nwithin particular \u2018body focused\u2019 arenas such as modelling, gymnastics and dance. \n(Vincent 1989, Adair 1992, Buckroyd 1996, 2000, Fay 1997, Hamilton 1997). The \nfemale ballet dancer is not only influenced by her genetic endowment but also by \npeers, teachers, role models, company managers and directors. Expectations of body \ncontrol are learned. In addition to the obvious technical and expressive mastery of the \nbody, dancers also learn that controlling body shape and size is essential to success in \ntheir careers. This study offers an insider exploration of attitudes and behaviours that \ninfluence the body image of female ballet dancers. \n \nFORESHADOWED ISSUES \nTheoretical frameworks that foreshadowed this empirical investigation included \ntheories of institutions and the effects on \u2018bodies\u2019, for example Goffman\u2019s (1982) \nconcept of \u2018total institutions\u2019 identified characteristics common across sites, for \nexample, a \u2018managerial\u2019 \/ \u2018managed\u2019 split, conformity, control and surveillance. \n 5\nSmith (1998) identified ballet as an authoritarian, power \/ achievement culture which \nhe described as \u2018cult-like\u2019 where participants comply with the regime. This supports \nWulff\u2019s notion of cultural adaptation suggesting that dancers gradually absorb and \nmirror their culture (Wulff 1998). It is the unquestioning, subservient way in which \nthis is done, sometimes even accepting abuse and unreasonable behaviour, which has \nbeen criticised as \u2018silent conformity\u2019 (Stinson 1998). Foucault\u2019s notion of \u2018ascetic \ndiscipline\u2019, for example in monastic life, was a valuable notion in terms of collusion \nin self-sacrifice and denial in subservience to higher ideals. The \u2018disciplined body\u2019 \nwas further explored in Frank\u2019s typology of body usage, interestingly applicable to the \nworld of ballet, which also included the mirroring body, the communicating body and \nthe dominant body (Frank 1991). From Bourdieu\u2019s work (cited Featherstone et al \n1991), it is useful to consider the nature of the socially constructed body and, in \nparticular, the notion of \u2018physical\u2019, \u2018cultural\u2019 and \u2018economic\u2019 capital in increasing \nunderstanding of the development of a dancer\u2019s body image.  \n \nThe second major theoretical dimension foreshadowing the study was the \u2018ballet \naesthetic\u2019 or \u2018the look\u2019, that is, the perceived ideal of the female ballet dancer, \ndescribed by some as the \u2018anorexic look\u2019 (Stinson 1998). Where does this ideal stem \nfrom? Why and how does it change? How is it perpetuated? How is it challenged? \nWhat are its effects on students and dancers in the profession? (Vincent 1989, Adair \n1992, Novack 1993, Hamilton 1998). One way in which it manifests itself is in \n\u2018disordered eating habits\u2019 amongst dancers as they continually compete for selection, \nrecognition, roles, and general approval from the \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 to their life-\nopportunities as ballerinas. It is not surprising that some dancers develop a distorted \nbody image, poor self-esteem and narcissistic preoccupations. \n 6\n The power of socio-cultural influences cannot be ignored as increasing common-sense \nnutritional education reaches dancers both in training and in their professional careers \n(Chmelar, 1992, Brinson and Dick 1996, Koutedakis and Sharp 1999). As knowledge \nof the physiological and psychological effects of disordered eating patterns is \ntranslated into positive action via \u2018nutritional education\u2019 there is no room for \ncomplacency. This study seeks to explore the space between the rhetoric of improved \nsensitivity, knowledge and professional input and the lived experiences of dancers.  \n \nMETHODOLOGY \nThe research paradigm was essentially interpretive and critical. Interpretive, in \nassuming that interaction and reality are subjective and constructed through \ninterpretation, the aim being to understand meaning, perception and action. Critical, in \nexamining the role of ideology in the maintenance of oppression and control as well \nas the ways in which power systems and institutions legitimate their version of reality. \nThe researcher has over twenty years of experience: six years of vocational training \nand fourteen years as a professional dancer. The research aimed to capture \u2018thick \ndescription\u2019 and authentic accounts (Geertz 1973) of the human realities of ballet \nculture from the inside. Interviews, questionnaires and observation were used to \ngather data from ten female dance students in full-time vocational training at a \nboarding school (data collected is coded St-9 for group interview and St-10, St-11, St-\n12, St-13 for individual interviews and questionnaires), and eight professional dancers \n(coded D1 \u2013 D8), from a company fed, to some extent, from the school. In that sense \nthe school and company will be regarded as \u2018an institution\u2019. The researcher\u2019s life \nexperience inside both the school and the company, whilst enabling access to \n 7\notherwise largely impenetrable cultures, adds a rich dimension to the project. \nInterviews were also held with four teacher \/ managers (coded T-A, T-B, T-C, T-D), \nand two medics at the school and company (M-E, M-F). Findings were collated with \nexperiential observations in the daily workplace and retrospective observations \nthrough personal diaries and documentation, including biographies and \nautobiographies of professional dancers.  \n \nRESEARCH OUTCOMES \nThree emergent themes are used to frame the research outcomes; \ni.) nutritional knowledge and health, \nii.) the ballet aesthetic and disordered eating practices, \niii.)  factors influencing a dancer\u2019s body image.  \n \ni) Nutritional knowledge and health \nThere was no consensus in attitudes of students and \/ or professional dancers to \nnutritional education, which either indicates attention to different sources or diverse  \ninterpretations of information received. Nutritional knowledge levels were variable \nbut there was a lack of awareness about risks associated with poor nutrition. This was \nsupported by a medic with extensive knowledge of sports nutrition, who suggested \nthat dancers\u2019 nutritional knowledge was comparatively \u201cpoor in relation to what they \nneed and in relation to danger levels\u201d(M-F). Support systems in the school had \nchanged since the researcher\u2019s training days with the inclusion of nutritional \neducation and concern amongst teachers and managers. The culture of a ballet \ncompany is slower to change, partially attributable to common practices of re-\nemploying former dancers into teacher \/ managerial positions, thus perpetuating rather \n 8\nthan challenging traditional values, beliefs and attitudes. For example, one dancer, in \nan attempt to lose weight as directed, undertook an aerobic programme using the \nrunning machine in the physiotherapy room and had to cope with a flippant remark \nfrom management: \u201c\u2026 you\u2019re not an athlete \u2026 you\u2019re a dancer\u201d. The tension \nbetween positive advances in placing such equipment inside a company and dealing \nwith traditional expectations of dancers is clear. There can sometimes be a reluctance \nto consider new ideas inside the ballet world and a cult-like devaluation of outside \nadvice or knowledge in what one teacher described as some \u2018museum cultures\u2019 (T-C).  \n \nThere was a mismatch between dancers\u2019 attitudes and behaviours towards health and \nnutrition. Most thought that they led fairly healthy lives in relation to exercise \ndemands and the lifestyles of \u2018average people\u2019. Only one dancer admitted to not \neating properly whilst evidence from food diaries suggested \u201ca lot of dancers\u201d are \nonly consuming \u201cbetween 700 and 900\u201d calories per day and many are under 700 (M-\nF). As the medic highlighted, such habits can promote a starvation response that is \npotentially highly dangerous. This would mean that many dancers might be \nmaintaining an apparently reasonable weight by means of gentle starvation. They may \nappear to be \u2018healthy\u2019 because they do not look drastically underweight but they could \nbe nutritionally deficient. Many do not acknowledge this or are denying the potential \nlong-term problem. Such discrepancy between what dancers \u2018say\u2019 and what they \u2018do\u2019 \nwas supported by the lived experience of the researcher: \n \nI know this to be true because in the past I myself fooled people into thinking I \nwas being healthy whilst following an inappropriately restricted diet \u2026 \n        (Walters, 2000) \n 9\n The medic working with student dancers believed that they all ate healthily but \nrecognised a change in the older pupils (aged 14 \u2013 16) who started to cut back \nindicating vocational concerns related to weight. Many older students and dancers \nthink they are eating healthily and normally, but their ideas of healthy and normal are \nformulated according to the norms and values of the ballet world. Most cited cutting \ndown on food as their main way of losing weight, with extra exercise mentioned by a \nfew. Predominantly, dancers reported any lectures received as inappropriate for them \nor too basic, depending instead on nutritional and health information from magazines, \nbooks, and other dancers.  \n \nAll the students had received professional nutritional advice but most again \nconsidered the advice inadequate, contradictory and full of the \u201cblindingly obvious\u201d \nsuch as \u201cdon\u2019t drink coke and don\u2019t eat junk food\u201d (St-12). One problem identified by \nthe medics was that specialist nutritional advice was required by the dancers and \nrarely available: \u201cyou really need elite performers\u2019 dieticians\u201d (M-F). Dependency on \nprovision of food at vocational boarding school was identified as a problem by the \nolder students who were concerned about having to cook for themselves when leaving \nand that they would not know \u201cwhat to eat and what not to eat\u201d (St-9). None of the \nstudents mentioned having learnt about the physiological importance of good \nnutrition. \n \nAll the teachers expressed concern for the present and future health of their students \nand dancers. At the school in particular there was open discussion of potential \nproblems caused by negative body image and poor diet in adolescence:  \n 10\n \u2026if people get paranoid at a young age that is often a recipe for disaster later \non, people with eating disorders can have them all the way through their \nschool years and their years in a company and on beyond then, but the damage \nthey may do will be with them for the rest of their lives.  \n                                                                                                                      (T-C) \n \nThe professional dancers, on the other hand, felt almost unanimously that \nmanagement did not want to get involved with these issues. The medic identified \nsome indicators of positive change suggesting that management and teachers were \nnow more informed about the dangers of poor nutrition and rapid weight loss. Former \nrequests for instant results, for example: \u201cwe want the weight dropped for next week\u201d \nwere no longer made. (M \u2013 F) The employment of specialist expertise was a positive \nstep and was making a difference in challenging previous managerial demands that \nhad potentially damaging consequences.  \n \nAs society moves in a more sensitive and litigious direction, company and school \nmanagers are increasingly aware that they owe their dancers a \u2018duty of care\u2019 and \ncould face legal repercussions for consequences of excessive demands. (M \u2013 F). \n\u201c\u2026ultimately directors will start being sued by dancers who have eating disorders.\u201d \n(T-C). Teachers and directors were all aware of the growth of nutritional knowledge \nand of the increasing professionalization of this dimension of medicine:  \u201c\u2026(we) \nshould also know the limits of (our) knowledge and when to delegate to other \nprofessionals\u201d (T-C). One medic, who identified a link between poor nutrition and \ninjury, supports the case for extending professional support in this area. She suggested \n 11\nsome injuries were caused by lack of concentration and fatigue attributable to bad \neating habits. Dancers still believed there was a taboo surrounding weight issues in \nthe profession that still results in a silent, reactive response.   \n \nOverall, the evidence indicates that there has been an improvement in nutritional \neducation during the training of dancers and that there is some change in the \nprofession. However, while \u201c\u2026 many dancers now use aerobic exercise and specific \ntraining regimes to deal with weight and body shape issues, there is still evidence of \ndancers taking short term measures\u201d (D-3). There appears to be a mismatch between \nwhat dancers say and do; issues of nutrition and health are exacerbated as student-\ndancers move closer to entering the profession. Whilst professional attitudes and \nprovision are changing the rate is variable across company networks. This can leave \nthe established professional dancer feeling disadvantaged in terms of nutritional \nknowledge and support.  \n \nii) The ballet aesthetic and disordered eating practices \nDancers\u2019 concerns over their body weight, shape and size are related to anxiety to \nconform to the expectations of their vocation. The question of an ideal physique for a \nfemale dancer is not fixed or isolated from societal trends; it is politically sensitive in \nthe context of equal opportunities and it is rarely verbalised but visually evident in \nselection and casting practices in the ballet world. Currently the ballet aesthetic \npursues the \u2018cult of slenderness\u2019. Student-dancers and professionals experience the \nconsequences. Comparing biographies of leading ballet dancers with views expressed \nby respondents illustrates the effects of such pressures: \n \n 12\nMy head is full of prescriptions and descriptions of physical ideals, and I don\u2019t \nmatch up to any of them. \n                                                                                                (Bull 1998, p85) \n \nMost respondents thought that the \u2018ideal\u2019 ballet physique did not actually exist \nalthough there was consensus over essential attributes. These included long limbs and \na long neck, flat chest, being slim, skinny or very thin, but having toned muscles and \ngood proportions were thought most important. One suggestion was for an overall \nlook as \u201c \u2026 relatively androgynous\u201d (D \u2013 3) and another suggested: \u201cThe perfection \nis to be as strong as an ox but to look like a pin\u201d (D \u2013 1). These views are remarkably \nsimilar to Kirkland\u2019s description of the \u2018Balanchine look\u2019 as skeletal (1992, p57). His \n\u201c \u2026 female dancers have the elongated, curveless figure that is so different from the \nnineteenth century ideal\u201d (Fonteyn 1980). The dominant view amongst dancers was \nthat ideals were internalised and were a consequence of the training and the culture. \nThis equates with the mirroring bodies theory (Shilling 1993) in which bodies are a \nreflection of their habitus, and the socialisation of dancers into the ballet culture.  \n \nDisordered eating is one consequence for some dancers who strive to attain the \ndesirable attributes to improve their \u2018physical capital\u2019 as a dancer. Many of the \nbehavioural descriptions that emerged in the data reflect the diagnostic criteria and \ncharacteristics of eating disorders identified by Buckroyd (1996, 2000) including: low \nself-esteem, disturbed body image, failure to menstruate, excessive exercising, \nobsessive focus on food and weight, other compulsive behaviour, and secretive or \nsolitary eating.  \n  \n 13\nProfessional dancers provided evidence of disordered or inappropriate eating \npractices, whether experienced directly or vicariously, at both training and \nprofessional career stages. This was experienced differently in relation to \nphysiological, psychological and social factors. One dancer felt she had been \nrelatively \u2018lucky\u2019 having experienced few problems in this area but she reported that \nat school there were \u201ca lot of cases of girls who really messed around with their food \nor had anorexia or bulimia\u201d (D-6). She described one of her best friends going down \nto four and a half stone and felt girls were \u201cvery vulnerable at school\u201d especially when \nthey were trying to get a job. One interviewee admitted she alternated between \n\u201ccalorie counting starvation diets and eat-everything binges\u201d and \u201cdeveloped an \nunhealthy neurosis about food,\u201d suggesting that for many dancers \u201cweight is a \npsychological, not a physical issue\u201d (D-3). This raises the question of whether an \nunacceptable number of dancers suffer silently from eating problems\/disorders. All \nthe dancers interviewed talked at some point about anorexia or eating disorders and \nmost believed that a proportion of their colleagues were anorexic. Most also believed \nHamilton\u2019s assertion (1997), that eating problems occur in up to 35% of female ballet \ndancers, was a fair statement. In the words of another dancer:  \n \n...the majority of dancers have what I call a slightly anorexic mind, but are not \nactually anorexic \u2026 they perceive themselves as bigger than they are. (D - 5). \n \nThe \u2018anorexic mind\u2019, or distorted body image, appears to be something absorbed \nwithin the ballet culture at a very young age with potentially life-damaging \nconsequences. For example, a dancer who, when she was younger, was really \nobsessed with \u201cevery inch\u201d of herself looking perfect, admitted: \u201c\u2026it was very \n 14\ndetrimental to my mind and my health \u2026I never made myself sick but I would eat \nbarely anything.\u201d (D-7). This dancer, who had not menstruated for five years, later \nfound out that she had osteoporosis, with the bone density of her spine being \nequivalent to that of a seventy year old woman.  \n \nProfessional dancers linked their physical appearance with a system of rewards and \nsanctions in which weight-gain led to non-selection for parts and negative \nreinforcement, whilst weight-loss was linked with praise and selection. Observations \nand experiences of the researcher reinforced this. One dancer described an incident \nseveral years ago in which a ballet master told her to lose weight, giving her three \nweeks, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care how you do it\u201d (D-4). When she did so, by basically \nstarving herself she was rewarded with a part in a ballet. She could not maintain the \nweight when eating normally and so the starvation cycle was perpetuated. This story \ndemonstrates the links between body weight and self-esteem, and the impact of an \nauthoritarian culture on the lives of those \u2018managed\u2019.  \n \nThe professional respondents considered disordered eating practices an inevitable \nconsequence of the ballet culture. Psychological manifestations included feelings of \nguilt associated with food, secretive eating habits, obsessions with the mirror-image \nand with aerobic exercise. For example, six out of the eight professional dancers \ndisliked their bodies. One dancer described feeling constantly guilty about eating and \ncommented: \u201c\u2026there are loads of people at work I\u2019ve never seen eat\u201d (D-1), and three \ndancers felt that often people would not socialise or eat out because of this. Self-talk \nwas used by some to continually rationalise this behaviour: \u201cI feel I lose it mentally \nsometimes \u2013 you start weighing yourself all the time and you go \u2018why am I doing \n 15\nthis?\u2019 \u2026 Because I\u2019ve got a show coming up and I want to get to a certain weight and \nI know I feel better at that weight, or I get more attention, or look better in a white all-\nin-one.\u201d  (D \u2013 2).                                                                                                                    \n  \nIn contrast, student-respondents made no mention of obsessive behaviour or eating \nproblems. Lack of disclosure might have been related to the brevity of time together \nor the researcher\u2019s position as a leading dancer in a top company. \u2018Pressure to be thin\u2019 \nwas mentioned by a minority of students and rumours about \u2018weight-limits\u2019 in pas de \ndeux classes were shared. Evidence did not match that gathered by Buckroyd (2000). \nRespondents reported that teachers did not comment on weight for fear of causing an \noverreaction, which supports the increased sensitivity of teachers identified earlier. \nThey were weighed every term but felt this was mainly to check they had not lost \nweight, their focus was on healthy eating. It may be that this represents an \nincreasingly health conscious and positive attitude amongst the next generation of \ndancers. Alternatively this could be merely youthful optimism since the pressures of \nthe profession have not yet been experienced. Teachers and medics were aware of \npossible triggers for eating problems, such as puberty, professional role models, and \ncurrent ballet trends.  \n \nAn obsessive attention to weight issues does, for some dancers, go on to \u201crule most of \ntheir waking hours\u201d (D-3). Dancer - 1 thought such preoccupation with body shape \ncould; \u201creally get in the way because you become self-obsessed, you are always \ndriven by what you see in the mirror.\u201d  However, there was consensus that dancers \nrequired extreme determination to be successful and that striving for success could \nlead to a dancer being willing to sacrifice anything, including health, for their love of \n 16\nballet. Teacher C thought that: \u201c\u2026very sadly people can take that to extremes, they \ntry and control the one thing they feel they can control\u201d, whilst teacher A suggested: \n\u201cvery often the reason (some) have got so thin is because they really want to dance so \nmuch\u201d. Both quotations illustrates how eating disorders may indeed be a form of \nadaptation to the ballet culture in which it appears that thinness is often interpreted by \nthe institution as a sign of commitment or dedication and rewarded with advancement \nin the profession. In addition, such adherence to behaviours controlling a particular \nbody-type demonstrates a level of self-denial similar to the ascetic discipline, constant \nsurveillance and martyrdom of monastic institutions as described by Foucault \n(Featherstone et al, 1991).  \n \nBased on the researcher\u2019s experience, data gathered and biographies, it is suggested \nthat many of these attitudes and behaviours to eating are considered normal in the \nballet world, suggesting cultural hegemony whereby there is compliance and \nperpetuation of the ideals of the culture by female dancers. Choosing to ignore advice \non health, or even life-threatening behaviour, can be likened to the elite athlete, \nsetting aside legal issues, who is prepared to take performance-enhancing drugs, \nregardless of known serious health risks, for one moment of glory.  \n \n iii.) Factors influencing a dancer\u2019s body image. \nRespondents identified several key factors influencing the body image, beliefs, values \nand behaviour of female ballet dancers, including transmission of historical traditions, \ncontemporary role models, \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 and selection procedures, gender relations \nand culture-specific phenomena. Complex interplays of these factors have shaped and \nre-shaped the dancers\u2019 relationship with their bodies. \n 17\n Ballet ideals were thought, by most respondents, to be part of a cultural heritage, a \nhistorical tradition, of which they were part, transmitted through generations visually \nand orally via photographic and film records and by dancers turned teachers \/ \ndirectors, \/ choreographers. More recently globalization and communications \ntechnology enable the transmission of images around the world in microseconds that \nembody \u2018the latest look\u2019 of ballet stars, most recently influenced by dancers from \nAmerica, Russia, and France. The link with wider societal trends in fashion, films, \nand other art forms was also recognised. It is \u201cno coincidence that our best-bodied \ndancers can also double as fashion models\u201d (D-3). A more \u2018body conscious\u2019 society, \nwith commercially saleable \u2018slender\u2019 bodies fuelling a consumer culture, was \nrecognised as influential on the body-images of dancers: \u201c\u2026 a reflection of society, \neverything has become more streamlined\u2026\u201d (T-C). That interplay of cultures may \nowe a lot to past values and traditions in ballet. One dancer cited Pavlova\u2019s assertion \nthat sponsors and patrons would select dancers as \u201cpost-performance entertainment\u201d \nand suggests that \u201cdancers have always been required to be attractive in contemporary \nterms\u201d and \u201cthe link between glamour, sponsorship, and the ballet physique should \nnot be underestimated\u201d (D-3).  \n \nWorld-class female ballet dancers provide influential contemporary role models for \naspiring students and professionals alike, including both the \u2018global\u2019 stars of the day, \nand the \u2018local\u2019 principals in any given company; \u201cone leading dancer kind of sets the \nstandard\u201d (T-A). Kirkland\u2019s autobiography reinforces this, when she describes \nBalanchine\u2019s desire to give all his dancers, through his training, the endowments of \nhis muse, Suzanne Farrell. The result being that: \u201c\u2026he magnified the demoralisation \n 18\nof each female dancer; her despair that she did not look like somebody else.\u201d \n(Kirkland 1992, p54). Kirkland continued to describe the whole company as being \n\u201cconstantly engaged in imitation\u201d and the effects on her as she underwent cosmetic \nsurgery, silicone implants, and starvation in her desire to match an ideal. (Ibid.) The \nview amongst professional respondents was that individual personality mattered. \nWhere dancers had realistic \u2018body aspirations\u2019 they coped well with demands on \nphysique, dancers who were constantly unhappy, usually had an unrealistic, \nunobtainable \u2018utopian ideal\u2019.  \n \nThe power of management, of school entrance selectors, company directors, teachers \nand choreographers, cannot be underestimated in the search for external influences on \na dancer\u2019s body image. These are the gate-keepers of the profession who hold the key \nto others\u2019 life-chances and their view of the \u2018preferred look\u2019 for the female dancer \nmattered. \u2018The look\u2019 might vary according to the personal preferences of each \ncompany director, for example, while \u201cForsythei doesn\u2019t give a jot about body shape, \nDerek Deaneii by his own admission cares greatly about it\u201d (D-3) (Pook, 1999). \nDirectors\u2019 and choreographers\u2019 preferences will usually be evident in their choice of \nprincipal dancers, although, as one dancer pointed out, other dancers might \nmisinterpret the reasons for choosing those principals. Nevertheless dancers \ncontinually interpret intentions and implications of day to day company life through \nmany sources such as: interactions in daily class and rehearsals, canteen talk, cast lists \nand promotion. A positive strategy identified by the professionals was the opportunity \nto work with different choreographers because they came in with different ideas, \nbody-type preferences and approaches, resulting in new opportunities and \nperspectives.  \n 19\n In the world of ballet body physique plays a role in selection for vocational training, \noften as early as eleven years of age, and subsequently in auditioning and casting \nprocedures. Respondents believed there was a more open perspective on ideal body \nphysique in England than in some other countries, that attention to \u2018facility\u2019iii was \nessential to prevent possible injury, but that other qualities of artistry, musicality and \nexpression were also recognised. Teachers spoke of their awareness of the moral \nresponsibility when accepting someone for vocational training. Attention to physique \nin selection procedures continues amongst dancers as they compete to join particular \ncompanies, to gain promotion and certain roles. The dancer\u2019s focus on \u2018selection \ncriteria\u2019 and the \u2018subjective preferences\u2019 of gatekeepers is sharpened at such moments \nbecause of the personal investment and costs involved.  \n \nRespondents agreed that ballet would lose more than it gains with over zealous early \nselection procedures. The preference was for \u201c \u2026 personality and artistry\u201d in a \ndancer, rather than a great physique. One medic expressed the opinion that within a \nwide range of body types, while there were certain physical characteristics which \nmight be undesirable, on the whole no single one of those should prevent acceptance \nfor training, because body types can adapt when training is appropriate. Both medics \nwere trying to change the common perceptions within the ballet culture and both \nplaced the emphasis on toning the muscles with specific body conditioning and \naerobic exercise. They believed that the \u2018look\u2019 was achievable without weight loss or \ncompromising health. \n \n 20\n\u2018Culture-specific strategies\u2019 is a term used here to cover behaviours that have \noccurred within the training \/ professional institution of ballet. Those identified by \nrespondents as influencing body image included gender relations, teacher \/ dancer \ninteractions, environmental issues of mirrors and costumes and ballet critics. Issues of \ngender-relations in the world of ballet have been raised elsewhere (eg Adair 1992, \nNovack 1993, Hanna 1998), since it is an arena in which the female dancer is both \n\u2018idolised\u2019 and denied. The female dancer does live in a world dominated by male \ndirectors and choreographers, but in this research the professionals spoke of the \npressure to be thin being exerted by their \u2018male-partners\u2019. One teacher attributed this \nto increasingly ambitious pas de deux work in which women are \u201c\u2026thrown around, \ntherefore, the lighter they weigh the better\u201d (T \u2013 C).  One dancer talked about a \nparticular male principal, whose stage partners all became very thin, the suggestion \nbeing, that it was he who had this effect on the \u2018physique aspirations\u2019 and behaviour \nof his partners (D-2). It is not clear to what extent such pressure is attributable to overt \nmale demands or the perceptions of the women. \n \nTeacher \/ dancer interactions have had profound effects on the body image and self-\nesteem of dancers. In the past public humiliation has left a lasting effect on \nindividuals. Negative inferences on body size have been wrapped in such comments \nas: \u201c\u2026stay off the milkshakes\u2019 across the heads of the entire corps de ballet\u201d (D-3), or \nbeing told \u201c\u2026 you look like a puppy\u201d in front of colleagues and the choreographer \n(D-1). This type of behaviour describes one means through which an authoritarian \n\u2018power\u2019 culture maintains control and submission. Practices have improved in this \narea with a company teacher stating that, in this situation \u201cprivacy and sensitivity are \nabsolutely vital\u201d.  \n 21\n The ballet teacher is often revered, respected and \/ or feared. He or she has much \npower and influence over students and professionals. Tradition evokes an \nauthoritarian model of teacher-pupil relationships established in the ballet school, \nwhich often carries on into companies. Recent improvements in teacher training and \ninspection are changing this but the power of the teacher was raised in this research: \n \nI don\u2019t know if they (the teachers) realise quite how much the children hang \non their every word and want approval from them, it\u2019s everything \u2026 they are \nthe people that their whole life hangs on.  \n(M-E)  \n \nDirectors and choreographers can also hold apparent omnipotence as suggested in \nKirkland\u2019s account of how Balanchine\u2019s \u201cmonopoly on taste and creative control was \nabsolute\u201d and that \u201chis word was holy\u201d(Kirkland 1992, p49). She felt that the \ndancers\u2019: \u201cdevotion to him made us dependent on him for ideas and psychological \nmotivation\u201d (ibid, p47). These examples of extreme dependence on an authority figure \nimply \u2018cult-like\u2019 behaviour, described by Smith (1998), and may explain in part the \nlengths some dancers will go to in pursuit of a successful ballet career. Where a \nculture of dependency and acceptance exist, self-reliance, autonomy and critical \nthinking cannot. The practice of re-employing former dancers straight into managerial \npositions was thought to perpetuate such practices: \n \nI think a lot of dance managements, especially company managements, are \ncompletely (unprepared) people, who just stop dancing one season and \n 22\nbecome a ballet master or mistress the next. What gives them the right? \u2026 \nWhat do they know about people management skills? So they feel threatened \nand unprepared, they think if they are frightening enough you won\u2019t dare \nquestion them. \u2026We\u2019ve all grown up with that, haven\u2019t we?  \n                                                                                                      (T-D) \n \nThere was agreement amongst respondents that new teachers are more informed and \ntherefore students being trained today are better prepared to manage their careers. \nSimilarly, the education and further training of dancers is improving which will have \npositive effects on the profession. \n \nFurther influential factors on dancers\u2019 body image can be found in the ballet \nenvironment. The training and rehearsal environment utilises mirrors for self-scrutiny. \nRespondents blamed these for some of the body obsession amongst dancers. One \nteacher had trained in a studio with no mirrors and consequently had no image of \nherself as a dancer. When she turned professional, the company moved to new \nstudios, with mirrors all the way round the room which she found \u201ccompletely \namazing and very off-putting \u2026 I was like Narcissus\u201d (T-A). From daily observations \nand experience it is clear that many dancers will stand in front of the same mirror \nevery day in class because they find it flattering and it makes them feel better. Others \navoid looking in the mirror or stand well back from it, because they know it will make \nthem feel negative, and \u201cit can ruin your whole day\u201d (D-1). For the students, mirrors \nwere recognised by some as an important aid, but not to be trusted. Perhaps it is the \nmoment of entering the profession that predisposes some dancers to \u2018mirror paranoia\u2019 \n 23\nsince this step entails taking responsibility for yourself and the mirror can become a \ndaily source of self-check.  \n \nAlso within the ballet environment, costumes came high on the list of influences on \nbody image and self-esteem because they can play a large role in professional \nopportunities and progress. Costumes can influence casting, dancers describing \nrevealing costumes, such as the leotards and tights worn for many Balanchine ballets, \nas making them much more aware of every bulge. For some the benchmark for a \nclassical company was what a dancer looked like in a tutu, so if you had big legs you \nwere out. Practice clothes, the everyday costumes of dancers, were also dictated by \nbody image. Hence, those who felt insecure about their physique would cover up \nmore of themselves. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got the people who are so pleased with their \nbodies, if they\u2019re really skinny, and they are always wearing fantastic outfits.\u201d (D-1) \n  \nFinally, ballet critics have demoralised dancers with critical and personal references to \nbody shape or size. In addition to the effect this has on an individual it also reaches \nand gains a response from directors, with further repercussions for the dancers. One \nexample occurred when performing a Balanchine ballet in leotards and tights, two \ncritics gave bad reviews and made damning comments about physiques. One \ndescribed \u201can awful lot of wobbling bottoms on display\u201d while another said: \u201c\u2026 (this \ncompany) has rejected the starved-greyhound look in ballerinas \u2013 but now things have \ngone too far the other way. Bonnard legs and Ingres bottoms are all very well, but not \non a ballet stage, and particularly not in Balanchine.\u201d These remarks caused the \nmanagement to react by telling several corps de ballet members to lose weight \nquickly, under threat of losing their jobs, which naturally had a very detrimental effect \n 24\non company morale, not to mention the individuals\u2019 self-esteem. Unsurprisingly some \nof them resorted to starvation tactics. This is indicative of directors as servants of \nmore powerful masters, mediators and the paying public, who share some \nresponsibility for perpetuating rather than challenging cultural stereotypes.  \n \nIn summarising these findings, it is evident that there are many influential sources \nimpacting on the body image of female ballet dancers, some of which are considered \ninevitable and some of which could be obviated. The main themes that emerged were \nin relation to the level and quality of nutritional knowledge, the provision of \nappropriate nutritional advice, the physical and psychological consequences of \ninadequate attention to health, and physical and psychological problems caused by the \nideals of the ballet world. It is also evident that a female dancer\u2019s body image and \nconfidence are vulnerable to distortion due to the image conscious, physically \nselective nature of the profession and can be damaged by the effects of an \nauthoritarian power culture in which the body is a site of control, oppression, and \nexpression. Both the nutritional and psychological effects can be long lasting, but \nbecause they are often internal, they can go unnoticed and untreated, leaving the \ndancer to suffer in silence: \n \nThe ideal has been ingrained \u2026 I personally would like to get to a stage where \nI don\u2019t worry or think about it anymore, and have a stable diet, and where it is \nno longer something I stress about every day of my life. But right now I can\u2019t \nenvisage that happening. \n                                                                                                              (D-4) \n \n 25\nCONCLUSION \nThis research showed evidence of a training and professional environment in \ntransition from one of traditional \u2018cult-like\u2019 authoritarian behaviour with \u2018disciplined\u2019, \n\u2018mirroring\u2019, and \u2018docile\u2019 dancers to a more enlightened, better educated and prepared \nenvironment. The identity and self-esteem of dancers appeared to be affected by \nstriving to attain a ballet physique and many characteristics of eating problems were \nrecognised in the profession. \u2018Physical capital\u2019 was gained on the basis of both \nphysique and technical skill and was higher for dancers closer to the preferred  \u2018ideal \nphysique\u2019. A strong sense of surveillance was apparent but was regarded as natural to \nthe culture. There appeared to be a more balanced attitude towards physique and \nhealth issues amongst the students than the current professionals, which is promising \nfor the future. \n \nIt is clear that there are different perceptions of the ideal ballet physique and that they \nare constantly changing. Influences come partly from outside the ballet world in the \nform of fashion, the media, and idealised femininity in a male dominated society. \nMainly, influential factors exist inside the ballet world in the form of mirrors, ballet \naesthetics, demands of choreography, role models, teaching technique, costume \ndesign and critics. The power of directors, choreographers and teachers cannot be \nignored. There appears to be a dominance of male influence through teaching, \npartnering, choreographing, and directing but there is no consensus as to whether this \nhas any effect on forming or perpetuating particular ideals about the physique of \nfemale dancers. Most respondents thought dancers\u2019 bodies are a reflection of their \nhabitus and culture (Shilling 1993). Traditionally authority figures have used rewards \nand punishment and asserted absolute power but a cultural hegemony was evident in \n 26\ndancers\u2019 participation in the system and outward compliance with the institutional and \ncultural ideals. Even though dissatisfaction or disagreement may have been expressed \nin interviews it had rarely been expressed to management or challenged in public. All \nthese characteristics are consistent with power cultures, authoritarianism and cult-like \nbehaviour described by Goffman (1982), Foucault  (Shilling1993) and Smith (1998). \nIt was recognised by some, and unwittingly demonstrated by others, that these \ncharacteristics may play an important part in the body image and eating problems \ndeveloped by many dancers. There needs to be further education and action amongst \ncontrolling powers and dancers if real change is to benefit the female ballet dancer.  \nIt was apparent that nutritional education was inadequate, despite improvements in its \nprovision, and that some dancers continue to take short cuts, regardless of advice, in \norder to meet their higher ideal. It seemed most dancers were unlikely to heed advice \nthat was not related to the real demands of the profession. This demonstrates the \nextent of socialisation, as well as the level of acceptance that exists in relation to \nphysical demands and ideals. In discussions on selection the dilemma arose between \nthe principle of not eliminating anyone on the grounds of physique yet not offering \nfalse hope to someone destined to fail on the grounds of physique at audition \/ casting \npoints later. The main concern was to leave the door open for special or exciting \ntalent. \n \nRECOMMENDATIONS  \nAs a result of this research and reviewing the available literature it seems there are \nmany ways in which dance can move to a more enlightened approach as well \nsafeguard the interests of the whole profession. Some recommendations for action and \ncontemplation: \n 27\n Dancers (student and professional) should: \n\u2666 Recognise and develop their intrinsic motivation rather than passively relying on \nextrinsic motivation to work. \n\u2666 Learn how to safeguard their health and well being through nutritional and \nphysical knowledge. \n\u2666 Stand up to and resist the pressures which breed inappropriate eating practices and \nan obsessional focus on physique, and develop their individuality. \n\u2666 Not turn to docility and subservience as a safe refuge from the pressures of the \nballet culture. \n\u2666 Strive for empowerment, and have the courage to question and critique their \nculture and their art rather than merely accept its ideals and demands. \n \nManagement, directors, and choreographers (in schools and companies) should: \n\u2666 Ensure students, dancers and staff are provided with increased nutritional \neducation, appropriate for dancers and given by elite performers\u2019 dieticians. \nProfessional one to one advice should also be available on a regular basis. The \nincreased involvement of professional dancers should also be considered, to \nprovide positive role models. \n\u2666 Include mental training to deal with stress and self esteem in the training of \ndancers and teachers and offer it to professional dancers. \n\u2666 Discard the traditional dictatorial authoritarian model, which damages self-esteem, \ncreativity, and artistic integrity, and instead lead the way in fostering respect and \ncommunication. \n\u2666 Be aware of the potential for abuse that power carries. \n 28\n\u2666 Recognise that weight gain is not always the result of overeating and that \ninappropriate handling of the problem can damage a dancer, mentally and \nphysically, for life.  \n\u2666 Resist the temptation to succumb to an idealistic, image conscious culture and try \nto see beyond a dancer\u2019s physical appearance. Dance is after all about, not only \nexpression through control of the body, but also the creation of illusion and \ntransformation through characterisation. \n\u2666 Recognise that dancers possess intrinsic motivation, passion, and artistry, which \ncan, and needs to be, cultivated, and that intimidation and humiliation destroy \nconfidence, self-esteem, and motivation. \n \nThe dance world in general should: \n\u2666 Critically examine the current physical aesthetic and the motivation behind it and \nwhether it enhances or damages ballet dancers as artists or ballet as an art form. \nThe profession should question its priorities for the 21st century in relation to \nemotional, physical, and artistic integrity as well as what it has to offer the world.  \n \n\u2666 Dancers, choreographers, directors, medical professionals, and ballet teachers \nshould all share responsibility for dancers\u2019 bodies and communicate better on the \npossibilities and limitations of nutrition, physique and career opportunities.  \n \n\u2666 The same level of responsibility should apply to psychological health and artistic \ndevelopment. \n \n 29\n 30\n                                                          \n\u2666 Dancers who move into management or teaching should be adequately trained in \nthe new skills and responsibilities those jobs will require, especially in relation to \nnutrition, psychology, communication, and people management skills. They \nshould not be expected to deal with unfamiliar and potentially alarming situations \nunprepared and untrained, since this may encourage inappropriate or abusive \nresponses. \n \n\u2666 As is beginning to happen in other countries, ballet training for students and \nprofessionals alike, should be developed to include variety of content, method, \nand approach such as the use of visualisation, stress control techniques, and \naerobic work. This may take the emphasis away from physique and physical \nappearance, and encourage the development of healthy, happy, and balanced \ndancers who can perform to their peak. \n \nOnly by finding a healthy balance of mind, body and spirit can one truly  \nbecome  a great artist. \n  \n                       (John Alleyne, Artistic Director, Ballet British Columbia 1999) \n                                                                                         (see Bronkhorst 1999)  \n \ni William Forsythe is a choreographer, and Director of Frankfurt Ballet.
