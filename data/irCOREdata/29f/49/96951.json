We present a numerical study of the nonlinear mechanical model \nfor morphogenesis proposed by Oster et al. (1983) with the aim of establishing \nthe pattern forming capability of the model.

Mechanical model and background \nA central issue in developmental biology is the formation of spatial pattern and \nform in the early embryo. Various models and mechanisms have been proposed \nto describe the pattern formation process, such as those based on the reaction- \ndiffusion theory of Turing (1952) involving chemicals called morphogens ( ee, \nfor example, Gierer and Meinhardt (1972), Murray (1977, 1981) and Meinhardt \n(1983)). Such models can produce various patterns observed in development; \nthe existence of morphogens in embryology, however, has yet to be established. \nAn alternative approach to morphogenetic pattern formation is based on the \nmechanochemical interaction of mesenchymal cells with the extracellular matrix \n(ECM) -  a complex of cross-linked collagen fibres and glycosaminoglycans \n(GAGS) -  on which they move (see, for example, Oster et al. (1983), Murray \nand Oster (1984a, b), Oster et al. (1985)). This new approach to pattern formation \nhas been applied to several widely studied phenomena in developmental biology, \nsuch as the formation of feather germ primordia in chicks (Sengel (1976), \nDavidson (1983a, b), Dhouailly (1983)) and cartilage formation in chick and \namphibian limbs (for example, Wolpert (1981), Maden (1982), Solursh (1983), \nShubin and Alberch (1986)). \n526 A.S. Perelson et al. \nIn this paper, by studying nonlinear pattern selection we extend the predictions \nof possible spatial patterns in the mechanical model proposed by Oster et al. \n(1983). Their analysis, based on linear theory, indicated that stable spatial patterns \nwould evolve from the full nonlinear system of equations. Here we explicitly \ndemonstrate a set of such patterns obtained in a variety of parameter regimes. \nA key aspect of this paper is the technique used for pattern selection. When a \ndispersion relation qualitatively indicates linear growth of a particular wave \nnumber, the selection of the specific parameter values to isolate such a wave \nnumber is not a trivial exercise. This is particularly so when the number of \nparameters involved is more than one or two, as is the case with these \nmechanochemical models. Here we develop a technique based on nonlinear least \nsquares fitting to a desired dispersion relation that allows us to isolate particular \nwave numbers when the number of parameters i large. We study an example \ninvolving seven parameters. To set the stage for our analysis, we give a brief \nintroduction to the model equations and refer the reader to the original paper \n(Oster et al. (1983)) for fuller details. \nThe model consists of conservation equations for mesenchymal cell and \nextracellular matrix (ECM) densities, n(x, t) and p(x, t) respectively, where x is \nthe spatial coordinate and t the time. These are coupled with a force balance \nequation for the mechanical interaction of cells with the matrix, which determines \nthe displacement, u(x, t), of a material point of ECM located at position x. We \nconsider each equation in turn. \nCell conservation equation \nThe equation for cell density is of the form \nOn\/Ot = -V  \f9 _Jn + cell division (1.1) \nwhere _Jn is the cell flux, which consists of several terms: \nDiffusion. We take the flux due to random motion to be given by \n-Jdiffusion ~ --  D1 V n. \nFor simplicity we take D1 to be constant. Oster et al. (1983) include a long range \ndiffflsional flux, which is not included here again for simplicity. \nHaptotaxis. Cells move by attaching their lamellapodia to specialized adhesive \nsites in the ECM. The tendency of cells to move up a gradient in adhesive site \ndensity is known as haptotaxis and is modelled by \n-Jhaptotaxis ~- o \/ t lVp ,  \nwhere ce is a non-negative constant. \nConvection. Cells may be convected by the motion of the matrix with the convective \nvelocity au\/Ot. Thus, \n-Jconvection -'~ n O u \/Ot .  \nTherefore, the total flux, _Jn, is given by \n_Jn = ]diffusion + -Jhaptotaxis -~- -J . . . . . .  t ion. (1 .2 )  \nPattern selection i a model for morphogenesis 527 \nCell division. Cell division (mitosis) increases igmoidally with cell density, and \nso we qualitatively model this with the simplest erm exhibiting such sigmoidal \nbehaviour, namely the logistic form \nmitotic rate = rn(N-  n) (1.3) \nwhere r and N are positive constants. \nSubstituting (1.2) and (1.3) into (1.1) gives the equation for cell conservation. \nForce balance quation \nAs we are dealing with a system with low Reynolds number, inertia terms may \nbe neglected, and the stress tensor tr(x, t) satisfies the force balance equation \nV.  cr +p_F = 0_, (1.4) \nwhere F is an external body force (Purcell (1977)). The stress tensor, ~r, consists \nof two components, \n~lr \"~- O'rnatr ix + (IP eel l .matr i  x . (1 .5 )  \nWe model the matrix as a linear, isotropic, visco-elastic material with stress tensor \nO'matr ix  = \/.L 1 aE\/Ot+t.t 2O0\/OtI+[E\/(l+ v)][e + vOI\/(1-2v)] \nviscous elastic \nwhere E is Young's modulus,\/Xl and\/z2 the shear and bulk viscosities respectively, \nv the Poisson ratio, 0 = V \f9 _u, the dilatation, e =\u000189 \f9 u +V \f9 _u r) is the (linear) \nstrain, and I is the unit tensor. \nMesenchymal cells can exert large traction forces by attaching to the matrix \n(Harris et al. 1980). We model the stress due to this cell-matrix interaction by \ntrc~-~,tri~ = r(n)n[p +flV2p]I, \nwhere z (n )= r\/(1 + ),nP), p >~ 2, is the traction per unit length per cell, and ~-, A \nand\/3 are positive constants. The\/3V2p term accounts for long range traction, \nthe inclusion of which is required because of the fibrous nature of the ECM. The \nform of z(n) takes into account contact inhibition: as cell density increases, cells \ncome into contact with each other and their motion is inhibited. \nWe assume that the cell-matrix composite is attached to some external sub- \nstratum (for example the sub-dermal layer in the chick skin) by tethers that may \nbe modelled by a linear spring. Thus the body force in (1.4) is _F =-su(x ,  t) \nwhere s is the positive spring constant. Substituting for _F and er into (1.4) gives \nthe force balance equation. \nMatrix conservation \nThe matrix density satisfies the conservation equation \nOp\/Ot = -V  \"Jp +matrix secretion by cells (1.6) \nwhere .\/p is the matrix flux. The matrix moves only when it is deformed ue to \ncellular traction forces, that is, it moves by convection with velocity Ou\/Ot. \n528 A.S. Perelson et al. \nTherefore \nj~  = p oulot. \nWe assume negligible matrix secretion on the time scale we are dealing with. \nSubstituting for _Jp into (1.6) gives the matrix conservation equation. \nWe consider in this paper only the one-dimensional situation and non- \ndimensionalize the model equations (1.1), (1.4) and (1.6) by introducing the \nquantities \nx*=x\/L,  t*=t\/To, n*=n\/N, P* =P\/Po, u*=u\/L, A*=AN 2, \n\/3\" = r 2 , s*=spo(l+v)L2\/E, D*I=D, To\/L 2 ,\nc~* = c~poTo\/L 2, r* = rNTo, ~'* = cpoN\/E, tx = (~1 + ~2)(1 + v)\/ETo, \nwhere L and To are typical ength and time scales respectively, and po is a typical \nmatrix density. The governing equations become, omitting the asterisks for alge- \nbraic simplicity, \nOn\/Or= Dx O2n\/Ox2-O\/Ox(n Ou\/Ot)-a O\/Ox{nOp\/Ox}+rn(1-n) (1.7a) \nO\/Ox[t.~ 02 u\/Ox OI + Ou\/Ox +[ r (1 +AnP)]{p +13 OZp\/Ox2}] = SUp (1.7b) \nOp\/Ot + O~ Ox{p Ou\/Ot} = 0. (1.7c) \nThese equations were studied in the domain xc[0,1]  with periodic boundary \nconditions. \nIn the next section, we discuss the dispersion relation for the linearized system. \nSetting various parameters equal to zero gives rise to a wide variety of possible \ndispersion relations suggesting a richness in pattern forming capability of the \nmodel. We also describe a method for pattern selection using nonlinear least \nsquares fitting to a desired dispersion relation. In Sect. 3 we briefly describe the \nnumerical technique used to compute solutions to (1.7) and present results of \nthe numerical simulations. We use the results obtained to set up a scenario for \nsequential formation of dermal aggregates (papillae) in the chick back (dorsal \nptylera). In Sect. 4 we consider the model in the light of Davidson's (1983a, b) \nexperiments on the mechanism of feather development in the dorsal pteryla and \ndiscuss the possibility of using the nonlinear least squares technique for determin- \ning the parameter space wherein a certain mode is selected in general pattern \nformation problems. \n2. Linear theory of pattern selection \nWe consider the stability of the biologically relevant steady state \nn=p=l ,  u=O \nof (1.7) in the usual way by setting \nn=l+n ' ,  p=l+p ' ,  u=u', \n(2.1) \nPattern selection i a model for morphogenesis 529 \nwhere In'l, Ip'l and lu'l are small. Substituting into (1.7) and keeping only first \norder terms in the primed variables we have a set of linear equations for n', u' \nand p'. We look for solutions of the form \nu' ocexp[o~(k)t+ikx] .  \np' \nThe solvability condition gives rise to the dispersion relation \n~[\/xk2tra +b(k)tr  + c(k)] = 0, (2.2) \nwhere \nb(k) = [\/zD1 + fl~-\/(1 + X)]k4 q - [I q-\/~r -- 2~'\/(1 + A)2]k2 + s, \nc(k) = { r\/3Dl\/(1 + h)}k6+ {~-(1 + it)-1[ r\/3 - D~ - a (1 - 2A\/(1 + A))] + D~}k 4\n+ [sD 1 + r - rr\/(1 + h)]k2 + rs. \nHere we have taken the inhibition parameter p = 2 (see (1.7b)). When solved this \nequation gives the growth rate tr as a function of the parameters and the wave \nnumber, k. \nSetting different parameters to zero gives rise to a wide selection of dispersion \nrelations (Murray and Oster (1984a, b); Maini et al. (1984)). The steady state \n(2.1) will be unstable to spatial perturbations of wave number, k, if the growth \nrate for that k is positive; that is, where Re o-(k) > 0. On the domain [0, 1], the \nsteady state (2.1) will then be unstable if there exists an integer n, such that \nRe tr(2n~r) > 0. To isolate the nth mode, we need to choose parameters such that \nRe o-(2mr) > 0 and Re tr(2mTr) < 0 for all other integers m. \nClearly the complicated form of the dispersion relation (2.2) makes the \ndetermination of the parameter space in which a certain mode is isolated very \ndifficult. We approach this by solving the inverse problem, that is, we choose the \nform of the dispersion relation we would like, then fit the actual dispersion \nrelation to it using a nonlinear least squares package. The routine we used is \nbased on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (Mor6 (1977)) and minimizes the \nsum of squares of a set of nonlinear functions in n variables. Thus, if we choose \nthe functional form, y, of the dispersion relation required to isolate a particular \nmode, the package chooses values of the parameters {D1, a, r,\/z, \"r, ~, S, h} which \nminimizes the objective function \nJ = ~ IRe o-(i)-y(i)[2 (2.3) \ni= l  \nthat is, it fits Re cr to the \"idealized\" dispersion form y. It is not necessary to \nchoose a functional form for y, we can simply choose m fictitious \"data\" points \nthat mimic the desired shape of the dispersion relation and minimize (2.3). The \nbest fit may involve negative values of some of the parameters and these values \nhave no meaning in a biological context. To overcome this problem, we replace \neach parameter, xl by f (p0 ,  where f (P i )  >i O, and then minimize J ' (P l , . . . ,  P,) = \nJ ( f (PO, . . .  , f (P , )  with respect o pi. For our simulations we chose x~ = exp(p~). \nThus even ifpi is negative, the biological parameter xi is positive. The exponential \n530 A.S.

We \nchoose data points such that this mode is \nthe only unstable permissible mode. The \ncurve fitting routine fits Re o-(k) to these \npoints. The package used minimises the sum \nof squares of m nonlinear functions in n \nvariables and is based on the Levenberg- \nMarquardt algorithm (Mor~ (1977)). We \ntook m=8,  n=7,  that is, we set r=0 and \nfitted for the remaining seven parameters. \nThe values of the parameters here are D 1 = \n0.2, s=177.8, \/3=0.0021, ~'=10.2, \/x= \n0.022, A = 1.96, c~ =0.026. Computations \nwere performed on the CRAY1 and CDC \n7600 at Los Alamos National Laboratory \nhas the disadyantage that small changes in p; lead to large changes in xi. Because \nonly certain ranges of parameter values make biological sense, good initial \nparameter guesses and\/or choices of fictitious data points, were required to keep \nthe final values within the relevant range. Absolute minima of the objective \nfunction were not required, only sets of parameters that gave rise to dispersion \nrelations of the required form. Using this criterion multiple solutions could be \nfound by different choices of initial parameters or data values. For this problem, \nin which a lot of earlier analysis had been done, good initial guesses were easily \nfound which yielded biologically reasonable final parameter values. Figure 2.1 \nillustrates the dispersion relation thus obtained to isolate the k~ r = 4 mode. For \nother problems, different choices forf(pi) might be more appropriate. One referee \nsuggested f(p~)= p~, although this has the disadvantage of generating a singular \nJacobian matrix when p~ = 0, that is OJ\/Op~ = 2pi OJ\/Ox~. Algorithms other than \nLevenberg-Marquardt in which constraints could be placed on the parameter \nsearch domain could also be tried. \nIn some cases, depending on the values we choose for the \"data points\" y, \nthe best fit obtained was of the form illustrated in Fig. 2.2. However, since traction \nis a destabilizing factor, increasing ~\" moves the dispersion relation upwards.

In some cases the curve fitting \nroutine was unable to give the shape of the \ndispersion relation required to isolate a \nmode. However, we know from physical \nconsiderations that r moves the dispersion \nrelation vertically, fl controls the stability \nof higher wave number spatial variation and \ns controls the stability of lower wave num- \nber spatial variation. By varying these three \nparameters we can convert this type of dis- \npersion relation into one that isolates a \nmode (as illustrated in Fig. 2.1). Thus the \ncurve fitting routine has reduced the para- \nmeter search from a seven-dimensional \nspace to a three-dimensional space \nPattern selection i a model for morphogenesis 531 \nparameter\/3 measures long range traction and affects the stability of large wave \nnumber spatial variations while varying s, a measure of the elastic (short range) \ntethering force, affects the stability of small wave number spatial variations. Thus, \ngiven a dispersion relation of the form illustrated in Fig. 2.2, we can vary these \nthree parameters to isolate a particular mode. \nAlthough this is a rather crude technique, in view of the large number of \nparameters and the complexity of the dispersion relation, the fitting procedure \nworked quite well. Occasionally the minimization procedure was trapped in a \nlocal minima not of the prescribed form (for example, Fig. 2.2). Nevertheless, \nthe procedure reduced the problem from a seven-dimensional parameter space \nsearch to a three-dimensional one (in almost all of these calculations we neglected \ncell division setting r = 0). By varying only % \/3 and s and keeping the other \nparameters fixed at the values given by the fitting routine, it was possible to \nisolate modes. \n3. Numerical study of nonlinear pattern selection \n( i) Numerical technique \nWe numerically solved (1.7) with r = 0, periodic boundary conditions, and initial \nconditions corresponding to u and p at their uniform steady state, u(x, O)= 0 \nand p(x, 0) = 1, and n randomly perturbed from its steady state, that is n(x, O) = \n1 + 6(x), where 6(x) was picked from a uniform distribution and took values \nbetween -0.05 and 0.05. To do this we used a general purpose PDE solver written \nby J. M. Hyman called PDE1D, currently available only at the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory. The program uses the method of lines to solve systems of \ninitial-boundary-value partial differential equations in one space dimension, and \nis an updated, expanded and modified version of the publicly available program \nMOL1D (Hyman (1979)). Because PDE1D and its higher dimensional analogs \nPDE2D and PDE3D are still under development we do not discuss the panoply \nof features available in the code. \nEquation (1.7b) was not of the general form required by the package, that is \nu_, = g(x ,  t, u,  u_x, _Uxx, . . .) ,  \nsince it contained the derivative Uxx,. The spatial part of all derivatives were \nrepresented using a three point, second order finite difference method. For the \nu~x, equation this difference matrix was inverted on each time step to explicitly \ndefine ut. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations in time were \nsolved by an iterated Runge Kutta Method (RKM). The iterated RKM uses a \nnested sequence of: Runge Kutta methods of increasing orders to achieve an \naccuracy of 10 -7 per time step. If the error in the solution is greater than the \nimposed tolerance, the method recalculates the solution using a higher order \n(more accurate) RKM. The procedure is continued until the tolerance criterion \nis satisfied (see Hyman 1980 for further details). \nThe reliability of the numerical method was monitored in various ways. The \nsolutions were occasionally recalculated in finer meshes and\/or with fourth or \nsixth order finite differences. The integration in time was also carried out \nusing Adams-Bashforth-Moulton a d Backward Difference Linear Multistep \n532 A.S. Perelson et al. \nintegration methods. Different, but equivalent, formulations of the equations \nwere also solved to ensure the numerical approximations had converged. There \nwere no constraints in the method to ensure that the total cell number and total \nmatrix density remained constant. Conservation conditions were monitored to \nagain check the accuracy of the method. \n(ii) Mode selection \nFigure 3.1 illustrates the results obtained on solving (1.7) using different sets of \nparameters that isolate modes one, two, three and four respectively. \nI f  we choose parameters such that the dispersion relation is complex, linear \nanalysis predicts a temporally varying solution (travelling waves). Figure 3.2 \nillustrates the result of simulating the full nonlinear system (1.7) with parameters \nsuch that Re o-(2~-) > 0, Re o-(2m~-) < 0 for all other integers, m; Im o-(2~) ~ 0. \nThese simulations clearly illustrate the importance of linear analysis in select- \ning parameter spaces wherein spatial patterns may form. Linear analysis, of \ncourse, predicts unbounded temporal growth, and it is the nonlinear terms that \nlimit this unbounded growth and lead to a steady state. Figure 3.3 illustrates two \ncases in which the nonlinearities cannot bound the growth. In Fig. 3.3a the values \nof the parameters are identical to those in Fig. 3.1a except that A, the contact \ninhibition parameter, is set to zero. Thus the cell traction increases linearily as \ncell density increases. Once an aggregate is formed, the traction exerted by the \ncells in the aggregate will continue to recruit cells from the surrounding neighbour- \nhood leading to the formation of a delta function in cell density. This has important \nbiological implications in that it indicates the necessity of cell-cell contact \ninhibition for stable spatial structures. \nIn several of the computations, the values of D 1 and c~ are very small, and \nr = 0. Thus the cell density equation is virtually identical to the matrix density \nequat ion- -  convection is the major form of motion. Therefore we would expect \nn and p to be similar. This is clearly illustrated by our results. Thus the stress \ndue to cell traction may be approximated by \nO'ce l l _matr ix  ~--- [fll~'n\/(1 + AnP)][n + fl OZn\/Ox 2] (3.1) \nwhere\/31 is some positive constant. I f  we choose p = 2, the first term in troen-mat,-ix \nasymptotes to\/31T\/A for n large, and\/3~'n 2 for n small. Thus, once an aggregate \nis formed, it will continue to exert a constant traction, while the (small) population \nof cells nearby exert a traction proportional to the square of the cell density, \nwhich is small. This would lead to unbounded growth in the cell aggregate, unless \nthe value of 02n\/Ox 2is such that the contribution of this term to O'cell.matrix balances \nthe above variation in traction. In Fig. 3.3b this clearly does not happen. If we \nincreased p, then, for large cell density, the cell traction, which behaves like n 2 -p  \nfor large n, would be small and a bounded steady state may exist (Fig. 3.3c). \n( iii) Fast mode selection \nIn Sect. 2 we mentioned that the dispersion relation gave rise to a wide variety \nof behaviours depending on the values of the parameters. On setting certain \nparameters to zero, there is the possibility of an infinite linear growth rate for a \nparticular mode and we would expect fast selection for this mode (Maini et al. \nPattern select ion in a mode l  for  morphogenes is  533 \n2i n \no \no x \nJ n \n1.5- \n1.0- \n0.5 \n0 x \nn \n1.01 - \n1.00- ~ \n0.99 \n0 x \n2 _~ n \n0 \nx \nu \n0.2- \n-0.2- \n0 x \na \n0.2t  u \n-o.24 \n0 \nx lo -s \n0.5- \nO- \n-0.5 \n0 \nx 10 -1 \n0.25- \nO- \n-0 .25-  \n0 \nx \nb \nx \nd \np \n2 \no \nx \np \nI \no \nx \np \n1,Ol \n1.oo \n0.99 \nx \n2 ! \n0-  \n0 x \nFig. 3.1a-d.

Of course, by making some of the parameters small instead of zero it is \npossible to bound the growth rate, but, even so, the maximum (linear) growth \nrate is still large. To numerically simulate the full nonlinear system for such \nparameter values is difficult because of stiffness problems. Figure 3.4 illustrates \nsuch a dispersion relation and the result of simulating (1.7) with these parameter \nvalues. Clearly the first mode (one aggregate) is selected almost immediately and \ngrows until the matrix density goes negative, which is, of course, a reflection of \naccumulating numerical errors. \n(iv) Multiple mode selection \nIn this paper we have been concentrated on a single mode selection: we chose \nparameters uch that linear analysis predicted only one permissible unstable \nmode. An interesting problem is to consider the situation where more than one \nmode is unstable and to investigate what mode, if any, will be selected. \n( v) Sequential formation of two-dimensional patterns \nOne of the motivations for studying the ability of the model to generate pattern \nsequentially comes from the results of Davidson's (1983) experiments on dermal \ncell aggregation. Leaving aside the controversial problem of which aggregate \nforms f i r s t -  the epidermal placode or the dermal papi l la - - i t  appears that the \nfirst dermal aggregate forms approximately in the centre of the dorsal midline \non the chick back. Two further aggregates then form, one on either side of this \ninitial aggregation, also along the dorsal midline. More aggregates then form on \neither side of the dorsal midline but displaced longitudinally from those on the \ndorsal midline to give an hexagonal pattern of papillae. The \"wave\" of aggrega- \ntions then spreads out forming a regular hexagonal pattern. Although the initial \nrow is not necessary for the formation of subsequent neighbouring rows it does \ndetermine the position of the subsequent papillae. \nAs cells mature, their mechanical properties change. For example, the traction \nexerted by mesenchymal cells in vitro can increase dramatically over a period of \na few days (Harris, personal communication). Suppose that in a given domain \nthe cell tractions are as shown in Fig. 3.5a; that is, the central cells have aged to \nthe point where they have commenced to contract with a force % while the \nperipheral cells have not yet matured to the contraction stage. Then, as shown \nPattern select ion in a model  for morphogenesis  \nr3 \n5.0- \n2.5- \n0 \n0 x \n\/ \n0.5-~ u \nI \n-0,5 I \n0 x \na \n5.0t n \n13 x \nu \n1,0 \n-1.0 1 0 x 3 \nb \nP 5.0 \n2. \nol \n0 x \nP \n5.0- \n2,5- \n0 \n0 \u2022 \n535 \n2.0- \n1.0- \n0 x \n0.2. \nO- \n-0.2 \u000184 \nx 3 \nC \nP \n2.0 \n1.1 \n0 x \nFig. 3.3. a L inear analysis predicts one aggregate.

In this case, there is \neffectively no contact inhibit ion (see text for detail). Parameters are D 1 = a = 0.001, \u2022 = 0.12,\/3 = 0.015, \n7=3.0 ,  s = 57.32, \/~ = 1.0, ngrd = 101 and t = 10. c In this case, t ract ion\/cel l  ( r (n ) )= rn\/(1 +an 4) \nand contact inhibit ion is strong enough to bound the cell aggregates ( ee text for detail).  Parameters \nare identical  to (a) except A = 0.1, ngrd = 31. The result is shown for t ime t = 1000 \nin Fig. 3.5c, a single, centrally located aggregation of cells will accumulate. If \nthis aggregation is stabilized by subsequent developmental processes, then as the \nperipheral cells mature and commence contracting an additional two peaks will \nappear as shown in Fig. 3.5c. In this way, a single peak will lead to three equally \nspaced aggregates. Thus the model can explain the formation of the initial row \nof feather germs. \n536 A.S.

If we increase \n~- on  [1, 2], b the homogeneous teady state in n with initial random perturbations bifurcates to one \naggregate at t = 1000 e, (number of grid points = 101). If we set ~- to 3.0 on [0, 3] and  p =4,  we get \nthree aggregates (see Fig. 3.3c) \nSect. 1 which led us to predictions on the pattern forming capabilities of the \nmechanism. In this paper we have established the nonlinear pattern forming \npotentialities of the model. Although our calculations are one-dimensional, they \nprovide considerable confidence that the model can generate regular stable \ntwo-dimensional patterns. We have presented a scenario for the formation of \ndermal papillae which is consistent with the results of Davidson's (1983) experi- \nments on feather germ pattern formation. The formation of the initial row of \npapillae is based on the cell traction being spatially inhomogeneous, a fact \namenable to experimental verification. \nIn Sect. 3 we presented only a partial investigation into the pattern forming \ncapabilities of the model. We neglected cell division in most cases and ignored \nthe possibilities of long range diffusion. The wide variety of dispersion relations, \ntogether with the nine-dimensional parameter space of the full model, suggest a \nrichness of pattern forming capability of such a mechanism. \nUsing nonlinear least squares fitting to the desired dispersion relation greatly \nsimplified the search of our restricted seven-dimensional parameter space. Our \nexperience with this technique leads us to believe that nonlinear least squares or \nmaximum likelihood fitting to a desired dispersion relation should prove useful \nPattern selection in a model for morphogenesis \n1.1 t n \n0 \u2022 \nu \n0.02- \n-0.02 \n0 x \nA p \nt . 5  \n1.0 \n0.5 . \n0 x \n539 \n2- \n1- \nn \nI \n-I \nI -o.2s t \nx I 0 x \nP \n2- \n0 \nx \nCeil aggregation \nI E \nStrain lines \n(i) (ii) (iii) (iv) \nFig. 3.6. a Initial conditions: random perturbations in cell density, n; matrix displacement, u and \nmatrix density, p, correspond to Fig. 3.1d, that is, we have a pre-strained matrix, b The steady state \nsolution at t = 10 with ngrd = 101 and model parameters identical to Fig. 3.1d.

Picking fictitious data points to indicate the shape of the desired \ndispersion relation was clearly imprecise and not always uccessful.

Perhaps parameter estimation techniques will provide a window through \nwhich one can gain insights into this problem in general. \nAcknowledgments.
