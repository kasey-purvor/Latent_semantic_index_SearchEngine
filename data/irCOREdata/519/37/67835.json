This interchange\nbetween poet and musician highlights Wood\u2019s abiding concern with\npoets and poetry, and particularly English verse of the 20th century.\nHe has described this repertoire as \u2018a treasure-house, and our poets\ncontinue to produce good lyric poetry to this day: it\u2019s a waste of being\nEnglish not to draw on these riches; and the composer has a particular\nduty to the poets of his own time\u2019.2 More recently, Jeremy Thurlow\nhas drawn attention to Wood\u2019s \u2018idiomatic and refined response to\nEnglish verse: his songs for voice and piano form a considerable part of\nhis oeuvre and must be considered the most distinctive and substantial\ncontribution to British song-writing since Britten and Tippet\u2019.3\nIn fact, about half of Wood\u2019s compositional output is vocal: mostly\nsongs for voice and piano.4 In these, his expressive musical language is\nfrequently paired with a poetic language of similar concentration. He\nhas written four sets of songs to poems by Robert Graves (opp. 18, 22,\n23 and 36); and he has set on more than one occasion, and amongst\nothers, poems by Ted Hughes, Edwin Muir, D. H. Lawrence, Laurie\nLee and Christopher Logue.5\nWood broke new ground in his choice of texts for the two latest\nadditions to this repertory. The seven songs to poems by Erich Fried,\nop. 43, are his first settings of the German language. Another first was\nthe use of a biblical text for the choral This is the Record of John, op. 44,\noffered to Wood\u2019s local church. The economy of material and direct-\nness of expression that characterize these settings can also be observed\n1 Hill, Geoffrey, Scenes from Comus (London: Penguin, 2005). The first 20 of these poems were\npublished, along with a short article about Wood by Martin Anderson, in The Stand 172 Vol.\n3(4) & 4(1) (2002), pp. 3\u201323 and 25\u201326. While the fact that the most extensive public tributes\nto Wood on a major anniversary should have appeared in a poetry journal should be a cause\nof embarrassment to the musical establishment, it also bears elegant testimony to his endur-\ning commitment to vocal music.\n2 Composer\u2019s note to the recording of The Horses, op. 10 (1967) (see n. 4, below).\n3 Thurlow, Jeremy, \u2018Hugh Wood\u2019 in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians II, ed.\nStanley Sadie (London: MacMillan, 2001), vol. 27, 548\u2013550; p. 549.\n4 Recordings of Scenes from Comus and the choral The Kingdom of God, op. 38 (1995) are cur-\nrently available (NMC D070 and Hyperion CDA66758 respectively). Wood\u2019s collections of\nsongs to poems by Ted Hughes (The Horses, op. 10 [1967]) and Edwin Muir (The Rider Victory,\nop. 11 [1968]) were released on LP (Argo ZRG 750), but otherwise his important work in this\ngenre remain unrecorded.\n5 Over the last few years, Wood has set poems by Thomas Hardy: \u2018An Ancient to Ancients\u2019\nand \u2018Thoughts of Phena at News of her Death\u2019. He is also working on some settings of the\npoems of Jacques Pr\u00e8vert \u2013 an old preoccupation of his.

Wood\u2019s gift was to set seven songs\ncontemplating themes of art, creativity and old age, which he drew\nfrom Erich Fried\u2019s Love Poems, a collection given to Wood by Goehr\nsome years before.7 Dedicated to Goehr, the songs received their first\nperformance on 7 March 2001, at the Austrian Cultural Institute. \nThe poems are characterized by their brevity and intensity, which in\nturn motivate musical settings in which Wood\u2019s already concise and\nexpressive style is concentrated further. Music and verse combine to\ncreate seemingly straightforward songs, but just beneath the surface\ncan be found a multitude of conflicting and complex undercurrents \u2013\ntenderness, irony, introspection, hope, bitterness and so on. Directness\nof communication is not to be confused with simplicity of message.\nThe opening poem, \u2018Gedichte Lesen\u2019, consisting of just two\nsentences, characterizes the concentrated writing style of the set in\ngeneral. The first sentence claims that those seeking salvation from a\npoem ought to learn how to read poems. Conversely, the second\nsentence, which differs from the first only by one letter (changing\n\u2018seine Rettung\u2019 (his salvation) to \u2018keine Rettung\u2019 (no salvation)\nsuggests that those expecting no salvation from a poem also ought to\nlearn how to read poems. The underlying message is that \u2018poems are\nworth reading in themselves, even if they don\u2019t change your life\u2019.8\nExample 1 is Wood\u2019s setting of the second stanza (bars 10\u201318),\nmuch of which is a reworking of the first stanza, but a tone higher.\nBars 10\u2013111 and 14\u2013152 are direct transpositions of the equivalent\npassages in the first half. Furthermore, the closing cadential figure\n(bars 16\u201318) combines the melodic\/harmonic content of bars 23\u20135\nwith the cadence of bars 7\u20139 so as to end in D major\/minor (bars 7\u20139\nclosed in the dominant A major\/minor). But there are also crucial\ndifferences. Thus in the first stanza, the word \u2018seine\u2019 occurs as an\nupbeat figure; in the second, the equivalent \u2018keine\u2019 is given greater\nemphasis by being placed on the beat. The melodic profile of the\nphrase is also altered: instead of a diatonic fanfare-like figure for \u2018seine\nRettung\u2019 we have instead for \u2018keine Rettung\u2019 an angular line rich in\ntritones (bars 12\u201313). The crucial verbal change on which the meaning\nof the poem hinges is given therefore highlighted by significant\nrhythmic and melodic changes from one stanza to the next. \n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 \u2012 \uf770\uf761\uf772\uf774 \uf769\uf769 27\n6 The Cantilena and Fugue and the small occasional piece Tribute to Michael Berkeley were\nreviewed in Tempo 59 vol. 231.\n7 Fried, Erich, Love Poems trans.

Comparison with the instrumental music discussed in the first\npart of this article reveals a somewhat expressionist rhetoric, in which\neach of the four two-bar units (the last extended by a further bar)\ncontain contrasting textures, melodic contours, harmonic density (and\ndissonance) and, significantly, motivic content. Nevertheless, above\nand beyond that conferred by the text, there exists a sense of conti-\nnuity within the passage. In particular, this can be felt in the\n(expanded) semitonal voice-leading prevalent in the outer voices of the\naccompaniment: these in turn relate to the frequent semitone leanings\nin the vocal line. The presence of characteristic melodic motion in the\nvocal line (the aforementioned semitones, as well as leaps of\nfourths\/fifths) imparts a certain sense of coherence across the other-\nwise fractured musical surface. \nIn \u2018Gedichte Lesen\u2019, the directness of expression of the musical\nsetting is strongly determined by the nuances of the poem: the\nresulting absence of strongly defined motivic coherence represents\nsomething of an extreme in Wood\u2019s song writing. In the second song\nof the set, \u2018Grabschrift\u2019 (\u2018Epitaph\u2019), the opposite pole is encountered.\nHere, the entire vocal line is explicitly derived from a three-note motif\n(B\u0002 \u2013 C \u2013 A\u0002); everything that follows relates to this motivic shape.\nFurthermore, of the 13 motivic repetitions that constitute the vocal\nline, eleven are direct transpositions of the opening figure to begin on\neither B \u0002, C#, G or E natural. The transposition of the motif onto\nthese four pitches alone ensures all the notes of the chromatic scale are\nbrought into play.9\n9 The initial ordering of these transpositions \u2013 beginning on B \u0002, E, C# and G respectively \u2013\nserves further to parse this chromatic gamut into two whole-tone sets. Although this bifurca-\ntion does not appear to have further structural ramifications within the song, it should never-\ntheless be noted as an instance of Wood drawing on such modes to organize his material \n(his later music is increasingly likely to draw on pre-existent modes as a kind of objet trouv\u00e9).\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f28\nExample 1:\nMusic \u00a9 copyright by Hugh Wood;\ntext reproduced by kind permission\nof Verlag Klaus Wagenbach GmbH,\nBerlin\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe composer instructs the singer to deliver his\/her line in an\n\u2018ironic\u2019 fashion, and we can assume that the motivic saturation,\nlacking Wood\u2019s characteristic subtlety, is a musical corollary to the\nrequired mode of performance. However, although the motivic repe-\ntitions act as a pitch constraint, they enable the freeing-up of other\naspects of the music. For instance, in responding to the micro-rhythms\ndemanded by the poetic text, Wood does not repeat the rhythm of a\nsingle bar in the vocal part.10 The dynamic interaction between\nmusical structure and textual demands is intensified midway through\nsong, when, speaking of the hunger of the poem\u2019s protagonist (who\nchose his art before bread), the poem mentions \u2018no cook at all, for\nthere was no broth to spoil\u2019. At this crucial point of the poem, the\nmotif is transposed to begin first on E\u0002, then A (i.e. the only two trans-\npositional levels not beginning on the underlying diminished seventh),\nwith the fall of the major third between the final two notes of the\nmotif contracted to a minor third. This slight change \u2013 a considerable\ndeformation in the context of the song \u2013 initiates a series of imitations\nin the piano that releases the piano from a purely accompanimental\nrole, thus emphasizing the content of the text. In this way, what\nappears at first to be \u2018ironic\u2019 and uncharacteristic motivic repetitions\n(which assert and assure musical coherence) are revealed to be an inti-\nmate and intrinsic part of the musical response to the poem.\nBy way of demonstration of the wide variety of expressive devices\nand the technical means displayed within the set, two further examples\nwill have to suffice. The carnivalesque atmosphere of the fifth song,\n\u2018Homeros Eros\u2019, is achieved through the simplest of means: an\nextended prolongation of a B flat major chord and the superimposition\nof a 5\/8 piano right hand over the 3\/4 of the voice and piano left hand.\nCombined with a throw-away ending, which punctures the mood with\nwhat appears to be an exaggerated raising of the eye-brows, the song\nreveals a light-heartedness that rarely finds a place in Wood\u2019s music,\nbut is all the more telling when it does so.11\nThe final song, \u2018Vielleicht\u2019 (\u2018Perhaps\u2019), is the longest of the set, and\nto my mind the finest. In its clarity of texture, material and means of\nexpression, it embodies the general tendencies of the set as a whole. Its\nwords express how art has the capacity to remain long after its\ncreator\u2019s death, motivating one of Wood\u2019s most contemplative\nsettings. The opening stanza is given in Example 2. The harmonic\nmotion of the passage as a whole, which gently shifts from a dimin-\nished triad on D towards B flat, might better be thought of as a slowly\nevolving harmonic field around a focal D. Combined with the motivic\nechoes and pre-echoes of the voice in the piano part, and the softly\nstumbling rhythms, the impression in bars 1\u20136 is one of expansiveness,\nand of reflection. The second half of the setting (bars 7\u201313) is also\nnotable for one of Wood\u2019s signature melodic shapes: a lyrical series of\nalternating rising major thirds and falling semitones. This shape\nappears twice, each time forming a complete octatonic set. A second\noctatonic set (on \u2018\u00fcberdauern\u2019) contains both a diminished triad on D\nas well as a B flat major chord: the octatonic set thus contains and\nsummarizes the harmonic motion of the stanza. Once again, we are\nconfronted with simplicity of means, but, as with all the songs in the\nset, the end results are both subtle and sophisticated.\n10 The use of free rhythmic development to contrast with repeated pitch structures suggests a\nparallel with Schubert\u2019s Der D\u00f6ppelganger.\n11 A similar ending can be found in Wood\u2019s Piano Concerto, op. 32 (1991).\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 \u2012 \uf770\uf761\uf772\uf774 \uf769\uf769 29\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThis is the Record of John, op. 44 (2001)\nThis is the Record of John, a setting of John 1, 19ff, was written for unac-\ncompanied SATB to mark the Reverend Prebendary John Slater\u2019s\ndeparture from St. John\u2019s Church, St. John\u2019s Wood. An occasional\nwork, the piece nevertheless demonstrates Wood\u2019s fluency in creating\nwell-balanced musico-dramatic structures.\nIn keeping with the nature of the text, the work falls into three\nsections. The first is a short introduction, setting the words \u2018This is the\nRecord of John \/ when the Jews sent priests and Levites from\nJerusalem to ask him \/ Who art thou?\u2019 The musical language is initially\ndiatonic (C major), and largely triadic, with frequent added notes\n(particularly sevenths and ninths). Only with the question at the end of\nthe section \u2013 a fortissimo statement in octaves \u2013 is the first non-diatonic\nnote introduced (a C#). This question, and the corresponding\nruptures to the musical language, set in motion a series of dramatic\ninterchanges that form the second section of the work. Here, the\nmusical language changes to a more chromatic idiom; the textures also\nbecome more fragmented as the textual dialogue intensifies. John is\nrepresented initially by a solo bass voice. Each of his first three answers\nhe gives to the chorus\u2019s questions ends a semitone lower than the one\nbefore (descending from F# down to E natural); these bass notes func-\ntion as points of reference within the section as a whole. \nThe second section ends with the fourth question of the chorus,\n\u2018What sayest thou of thyself ?\u2019. John\u2019s answer is first given to a solo\ntenor (\u2018I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness\u2019; its continuation\nis swiftly taken up and developed polyphonically by the whole choir\n(\u2018Make straight the way of the Lord\/ Amen\u2019. The musical language of\nthis third and final section returns to the diatonicism of the first, albeit\ngreatly extended. In total, the final section accounts for roughly half\nthe work\u2019s length, and acts as a musical and emotional counter-balance\nto the drama of the second section. \nComparison with the final section of Serenade and Elegy,12 Wood\u2019s\nother work to make use of such extended diatonicism, illuminates the\n12 For more on Serenade and Elegy, see part one of this article (Tempo Vol.59 No. 231, pp. 2\u201313).\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f30\nExample 2:\nMusic \u00a9 copyright by Hugh Wood;\ntext reproduced by kind permission\nof Verlag Klaus Wagenbach GmbH,\nBerlin\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nrelationship between diatonicism and tonal function in This is the\nRecord of John. In Serenade and Elegy, the unambiguously C major\ncontext of its Pfitzner quotation is marked by regular (if gentle)\nperfect cadences. The use of diatonicism enhances the affective quali-\nties of tenderness and innocence, and it is into this diatonicism that\nWood\u2019s bittersweet chromatic superimpositions are gradually\nabsorbed. In contrast, although the rhythmic and textural foreground\nof the final section of This is the Record of John evokes traditional\npatterns of closure, it is not supported with comparably unambiguous\ntonal references: it is \u2018on\u2019 rather than \u2018in\u2019 C. Thus, unlike much of\nWood\u2019s music, the tonal allusions do not gain their force from their\nfleeting, fugitive or momentarily beguiling nature. Rather, because\nsituated in an extended diatonic (and thus potentially tonal) context,\nsuch events are rendered significant through their distance or prox-\nimity to traditional tonal models. For instance, the closing section\n(bars 33\u201351) can be characterized by an avoidance of a strong leading\nnote: the one instance of a B rising directly or indirectly to a C is not\nsupported by a dominant-tonic harmonic progression (bars 37\u20138;\ntenor voice). As the passage progresses, linear motion in the bass\nbegins to assert a clearer tonal background, moving towards a domi-\nnant pedal (bb. 43\u20137). But this ends with an ambiguous sixth over the\npedal (suggesting a 6\/4 chord) that does not \u2018resolve\u2019 to the expected\ndominant chord. Instead, there is an implied plagal cadence (bb.\n48\u201351; to the word \u2018Amen\u2019), in which the concluding \u2018C major\u2019 chord\nis in second inversion with added sixth and ninth.13 The result is a\nmusical language that is delicately balanced between meandering\ndiatonicism and directed tonal motion: by achieving this balance, the\nwork achieves expansiveness and familiarity of expression but without\ndirect recourse to traditional gestures. \nCantilena and Fugue op. 47 (2004)\nThe Cantilena and Fugue for trumpet and organ was commissioned by\nDeborah Calland and premi\u00e8red at the City of London Festival. The\nbasis of the Cantilena is a broad theme first announced by solo\ntrumpet. The contours of this theme (though not all of the detail),\ntransposed down a tone, are given at the foot of Example Three as the\nnote-row \u2018P10\u2019. The semitones between notes six and seven, and again\nbetween ten and twelve, give some indication of the strong sense of\nlinear motion that characterizes the theme. \nThe actual music of Example 3 is the organ entry that immediately\nfollows the trumpet solo. Here, one can see the clear patterns of\nexpansion within the phrase, beginning with a two-bar idea in which\nthree notes rise through a fifth (labelled x in the Example). The next\nthree bars consist of a rise through a diminished octave (y); the next\nfour rise through an augmented sixth and then onto a major seventh\n(z; the \u2018final\u2019 major seventh is indicated by the dotted line). A compar-\nison between the given registers and the outline pitch structure at the\nfoot of the Example reveals that the original trumpet line has been\nfragmented into its constituent motifs, and then separated into\ndifferent octaves. Thus the gradual ascent that characterizes the\ntrumpet phrase is replaced by a staggered descent that, at its extremes,\nencompasses nearly three octaves. Such an expansion provides\ncontrast with the opening trumpet line, as well as preparing for the\naddition of the organ pedals in the subsequent phrase. \n13 The fourth in the bass \u2013 usually evoking a 6\/4 chord \u2013 is a recurring characteristic of Wood\u2019s\nmusic.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 \u2012 \uf770\uf761\uf772\uf774 \uf769\uf769 31\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe chords in the right hand of the organ part are initially derived\nfrom a straightforward segmentation of the \u2018row\u2019, as can be seen in the\nExample. Nevertheless, it is the line in the upper voice of these chords\nthat is taken and freely developed as a counter-melody. Indeed, the\nessence of Wood\u2019s musical argument is frequently \u2013 as here \u2013 the\nprogressive (non-serial) elaboration of such cells and the generation of\nrelated material. Continually underpinning this free development, the\nslower-moving theme in the organ left hand functions almost in the\nmanner of a cantus firmus. The final note of the theme is not given to\nthe organ, but rather is reached via a compound melody in the\ntrumpet that approaches it via contrary motion (see the beams added\nto the example). The F reached in the trumpet initiates a rhythmically\ncontrasted \u2018second subject\u2019 based on the same pitch material as the\noriginal row. (The organ pedals provide a new 12-note counter-\nmelody.)  \nWhat follows is formally simple, but crucial in determining the\ncharacter of the music: a mini-development and climax, a varied reca-\npitulation and a final statement of the opening theme, at original\npitch, for solo trumpet. This can be understood as a sonatina, a view\nsupported by the generally lyrical character of the material, and by the\nabsence of dramatic oppositions. The initial theme frequently recurs\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f32\nExample 3:\n\u00a9 Copyright 2004 Chester Music\nLimited.

This\ncan be seen at both the start and end of Example Three, and correlates\nwith Wood\u2019s practice of using complete thematic statements as a\nmeans to articulate form. Such economy makes the Cantilena one of\nWood\u2019s most concentrated works since the Quintet, op. 9 (1967).14\nThat this concentration should occur in a work of lyric fantasy, whose\nsurface charm belies the rigour of its working, is typical of this\ncomposer.\nThe lyricism of the Cantilena stands in contrast to the brashness of\nthe subsequent Fugue. The widespread 12-note working of the first\nmovement is also notably absent in the latter: after a chromatic three-\nnote incipit, the fugue subject spirals off into strings of ascending fifths\nand descending fourths.15 Before the exposition finishes, the theme is\npresented in regular crotchets that cut across the underlying 6\/8. This\npoints to two of the most endearing characteristics of the movement:\na cheerful rhythmic vitality and a staunchly non-academic treatment\nof fugal procedures. The first episode begins with a motif derived\nfrom the fugue\u2019s incipit, and there is a stretto in the middle entries.\nThere then follows two greatly augmented versions of the theme in\ndotted minims: first on the organ pedals (bar 30) and then in bar 32 in\nthe trumpet. After a second episode the subject appears in inversion in\nanother stretto. Suddenly, the fugue is abruptly cut off to make way for\na coda, announced by rumbling quavers in the organ pedals and\nmaking use of dramatic discourse between sprightly organ chords and\ndriving trumpet arpeggios. The subject appears briefly just before the\nend, shared between organ and trumpet, by way of closure. Such are\nthe facts of the fugue, but dry description cannot convey the energy of\nthe movement: this is Wood at his contrapuntal best.\nString Quartet No. 5, op. 45 (2001)\nWood\u2019s most significant contribution to the chamber music repertoire\nis undoubtedly his string quartets. The Fifth and most recent was first\nperformed in October 2001 by the work\u2019s dedicatees, the Lindsay\nQuartet.16 With Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Fourth Quartet as an obvious model, Wood\u2019s\nFifth Quartet is in five movements, arranged symmetrically around the\nslow movement, a Romanza. Wood\u2019s long interest in the scherzo gives\nrise to two Nocturne-Scherzi, placed either side of the Romanza. Of the\nouter movements, the first loosely corresponds to a sonata-allegro (see\nbelow), the last to a rondo: these are roughly equal in weight, and give\ngreater emphasis to the symmetrical construction of the work.17\nThe first movement of the Fifth Quartet provides a concise example\nof the sort of synthesis and refinement of technical, aesthetic and\nexpressive aspects of Wood\u2019s language that is typical of his later music.\nThrough its juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, one is reminded of the\nagglutinative forms that typify his Second and Third Quartets, and the\n14 Of works of this nature, Leo Black has written that Wood \u2018works his basic material very\nhard indeed: [\u2026] The resulting obsessed quality is moving, and uneviable: one would not\ncare to see those one admires forced into such risk-taking too often\u2019. See Black, Leo, \u2018The\nMusic of Hugh Wood\u2019, Musical Times vol. cxv, 115\u20137, p.116.\n15 Those keen on establishing links between movements may look to the countermelody of,\nsay, bar 16 of Example Three as a local precedent for these fourths.\n16 Strictly speaking, this is Wood\u2019s sixth quartet, but the early String Quartet in B flat (1956\u20137;\nsee part I of this article) is unnumbered.\n17 This differs from Wood\u2019s usual (Beethovenian) practice in multi-movement works, in which\nthe centre of gravity is generally placed in the finale. The First and Fourth String Quartets,\nboth with four movements, are good examples of this.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 \u2012 \uf770\uf761\uf772\uf774 \uf769\uf769 33\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nopening movement of the Fourth.18 The Second Quartet is a particu-\nlarly interesting precedent, for the central section of its overall ternary\ndesign sees an alternation of scherzo elements with ideas of a slow\nmovement character. In the first movement of the Fifth Quartet, the\nalternating ideas are that of a sonata-allegro first idea and second idea:\none visceral and gestural, one lyrical and contrapuntal. The \u2018mosaic\u2019\nform fragments and intensifies the sonata dialectic, not least through\nthe omission of transitions. Despite this fragmentation, the skeleton of\na three-part form can be detected, the final section a compressed reca-\npitulation in which the second subject is omitted. Further evidence of\na suppressed (or distorted) sonata background can be detected in the\nsecond section, which also contains elements signifying traditional\ndevelopmental elements. The visceral first idea becomes an energetic\nfugue; the lyrical idea evolves into a \u2018new\u2019 theme, which is also contra-\npuntally treated. The tensions between the suppressed background\nand energetic, dramatic and fragmented foreground contribute to the\nexhilaration of the movement. It is entirely typical of the composer\nthat the fundamental formal questions that arise \u2013 namely, how to\ngenerate coherence in a work that is characterized by discontinuity \u2013\nare dealt with intuitively, rather than through systematic means. \nThe scherzo-writing of the second and fourth movements must\ncount among Wood\u2019s most macabre. For the most part, they present\nmaterial in hushed whispers \u2013 scurrying lines constructed from chro-\nmatic clusters, often in imitation or even canon \u2013 and any dynamic\nclimaxes are swiftly stifled. Contributing to the fugitive atmosphere is\nthe evasion of lyricism, coupled with a general avoidance of normal\nstring tone. This latter tendency is particularly marked in the second\nscherzo, in which all the material is either played as harmonics (or flau-\ntando), pizzicato, or col legno. The emotional world occupied by these\nmovements is far removed from the high spirits of the scherzo in the\nClarinet Trio, or the barely-restrained impulse to dance of the scherzo\nvariations in the Variations for Orchestra. Instead, they have more in\ncommon with the scherzi in Wood\u2019s Song Cycle to Poems by Pablo\nNeruda, op. 19 (1974) but rather than evoke the haziness of summer\nand the hum of the bees (as in the Neruda songs), the quartet move-\nments conjure up something far more sinister, more spectral. These\nare Nocturnes in which the moon, if present at all, is closer to Pierrot\nLunaire than Clair de lune.\nIn naming the central movement Romanza, Wood draws our atten-\ntion to the fact that he has composed a relatively light slow movement,\nunlike the deep and intense Adagios of works such as the Fourth\nString Quartet and the Symphony. Such a designation captures the\nmood of the movement, as well as the nature of the material. The\nmovement can be divided into two \u2018stanzas\u2019, of which the second is a\nre-working of the first, followed by a brief coda. The two stanzas can\neach be divided into a further three sections. The first of these sections\nis introductory; I will return to them below. The second consists of a\nlyrical melody: in the first stanza this is given to violin I (bb. 12\u201320); in\nthe second, a decorated version is given to the cello (bb. 55\u201368).\nAlthough each of these instruments continue to dominate in the third\nsection of each stanza (respectively, bb. 21\u201342 and 69\u201379) there is\ngreater emphasis on contrapuntal working in the accompaniment. At\n18 The precedent for this was, according to Wood, was Stravinsky\u2019s Symphonies of Wind\nInstruments, which presented a \u2018formidable challenge to all [Wood\u2019s] formal conceptions\u2019\n(Composer\u2019s note to String Quartet No. 2, op. 13 [1970]). Wood\u2019s particular application of\nthis method, though, seems to me to owe as much to the juxtapositions of Beethoven\u2019s late\nquartets.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f34\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nthe end of the first stanza, this working leads to a climax; at the end of\nthe second, a warm coda in which violin I dominates once more.\nThere are numerous instances in Wood\u2019s chamber music output\nwhere individual instruments are given extended melodic lines: the\nPiano Trio op. 24 (1984) and the Clarinet Trio op. 40 spring most\nreadily to mind. However, this is the first time Wood has used this\ndevice in a string quartet. By positioning a movement with such a\ndirect (and simple) manner of communication after the densely-organ-\nized and suffocating sound world of the first Nocturne-scherzo, the\neffect is dramatically and affectively powerful. \nThe material of the Romanza is as straightforward as its overall\nform. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the introductory sections\nto each stanza. The lyricism and delicacy of the opening of the move-\nment (Example 4) is in no small part due to its faux-naivet\u00e9. The main\nmaterials are deceptively simple: the upper line largely based on\ndescending whole-tone scales, and contrapuntal lower voices that\nabound with figures based on the contours of motif x.19 There is also\na seemingly unsophisticated use of sequence: a direct transposition of\nmaterial between the first and second phrases, and, to generate the\npitch material of the third phrase, a second transposition of the whole-\ntone line. There are, of course, subtleties that reveal this to be a calcu-\nlated artlessness, such as the rhythmic transformation of motifs and\nthe placing and combination of material.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 \u2012 \uf770\uf761\uf772\uf774 \uf769\uf769 35\nExample 4:\n\u00a9 Copyright 2003 Chester Music\nLimited.

An addition of a new element \u2013 the viola line of\nbars 43\u201345 \u2013 alludes to a different harmonic interpretation. For the\nsecond phrase, only the descending whole-tone segment survives from\none stanza to the next, and in the third, the concluding harmony of bar\n9 (which is also present in bar 3) is given greater importance in bar 49.\nThere is something touching and elegant about the way Wood can\nimbue material that is almost banal in its first appearance with such\nsignificance and expressiveness.\nThe final movement, \u2018a sort of rondo\u2019,20 opens with a direct refer-\nence to the first theme of the first movement. But this proves to be\nplayfully misleading, for it is not this theme, but rather the\nhomorhythmic figure in the second violin, that provides the basis not\n20 Composer\u2019s note to the score.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f36\nExample 5:\n\u00a9 Copyright 2003 Chester Music\nLimited.

The inventiveness\nresulting from the extended focus on a single idea, coupled with the\nbuoyant rhythmic impetus, reminds one of Haydn finales. As is\nincreasingly the norm in Wood\u2019s later music, the recapitulation of\nmaterial is compressed, often through elision or juxtaposition of mate-\nrial. The resulting shifting of textures and moods brings the quartet to\na lively dramatic close, rather than the weighty solutions offered in\nmany of the composer\u2019s previous works.\u0003\nIn the light of Hugh Wood\u2019s recent music, it is possible to speculate\non future developments? Except for the banal answer that the technical\nprocedures and aesthetic stance exemplified by these works will\ndoubtless continue to inform his music, no single trend can be isolated.\nAs ever with this composer, numerous and seemingly conflicting\nimpulses co-exist, sometimes within the span of a single work. Thus\nthe asceticism of, say, some of the early variations in op. 39 finds a\nplace next to the romanticism of the later ones (in particular, the tenth\nvariation). For every densely chromatic and dissonant statement, such\nas the first Nocturne-scherzo of the Fifth Quartet, we can find the\nwarmth and lyricism of the Romanza. And so the list goes on. Wood\u2019s\nlanguage is rife with these seeming contradictions, and, in a true\nmodernist vein, his work does not shy from celebrating such discrep-\nancies. But what distinguishes Wood is his continued desire to explore\nways of making connexions between disparate states, to find ways of\ncommunicating human values whilst acknowledging the fractured\nnature of human life.21 In this light, Wood\u2019s expressive and sincere\nmusical language gains an urgency and significance that we are ill-\nadvised to ignore.\n21 Wood has articulated these concerns in \u2018A Photograph of Brahms\u2019, in The Cambridge\nCompanion to Brahms, ed. Michael Musgrave (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999),\npp. 268\u2013287.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 \u2012 \uf770\uf761\uf772\uf774 \uf769\uf769 37\n"}
