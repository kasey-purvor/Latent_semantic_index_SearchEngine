Many obstacles stand in the way of effective public sector \nand private sector involvement in partnerships in rural areas. \nThere is an urgent need for governments to move pro-partnership policies from \nrhetoric to action, through creating public sector working conditions that make \npartnership working possible, especially in health and welfare settings. \nMarginalised communities will seldom have the capacity to build and sustain \npartnerships without the help of a committed and well-networked external change \nagent. \n  \n \nAbstract \n \nThe importance of partnerships between marginalized communities and support \nagencies (from public sector, private sector and civil society) is a pillar of HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement policy. Such alliances are notoriously difficult to promote and sustain. \nWe present a case study focusing on the first stage of a  project seeking to build \npartnerships to facilitate local responses to HIV\/AIDS in a remote rural community in \nSouth Africa. To date this project has been successful in its goal of training volunteer \nhealth workers in home-based care, peer education, project management and \nprocedures for accessing grants and services. The paper focuses on the project\u2019s \nother goal \u2013 to create external support structures for these volunteers (drawing on \ngovernment departments, local NGOs and private sector philanthropists). The \npartnership aims to empower volunteers to lead HIV-prevention and AIDS-care \nefforts, and to make public services more responsive to local needs. We illustrate \nhow features of the local public sector environment have actively worked against \neffective community empowerment. These include a rigid hierarchy, poor \ncommunication between senior and junior health professionals, lack of social \ndevelopment skills and the demoralisation and\/or exhaustion of public servants  \ndealing with multiple social problems in under-resourced settings. We outline the \nobstacles that have prevented private sector involvement, suggesting a degree of \nscepticism about the potential for private sector contributions to development in \nremote areas. We discuss how the project\u2019s most effective partners have been two \nsmall under-funded NGO\u2019s \u2013 run by highly committed individuals with a keen \nunderstanding of social development principles, flexible working styles and a \nwillingness to work hard for small gains. Despite many challenges, the partnership \nformation process has seen some positive achievements which we outline, \ndiscussing the essential role played by an External Change Agent, and concluding \nwith a discussion of the possibility of building long-term structures to sustain the \nproject. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe importance of partnerships between marginalized communities and support \nagencies \u2013 from the public sector, private sector and civil society \u2013 is a pillar of \ninternational HIV\/AIDS management policy (UN AIDS, 2006). However, such \nalliances are notoriously difficult to promote and sustain. Much remains to be learned \nabout factors that promote or hinder successful partnership working \u2013 to map out the \nconceptual and practical terrain between well-intentioned policies, and the realities of \nworking in resource poor settings (El Ansari and Phillips, 2001a). \n  \nWe report on a project seeking to build partnerships to facilitate community \nresponses to HIV\/AIDS in Entabeni, a remote rural community in South Africa, where \n43% of pregnant women are HIV positive. HIV\/AIDS is highly stigmatised. Access to \nhealth and welfare support is limited by poverty and geographical isolation. Local \nhealth volunteers provide the only assistance available to many dying of AIDS. \nTrained through the uncoordinated inputs of missionaries, NGOs and patchy \ngovernment interventions, most work for no pay, with little training, walking long \ndistances up hills, often in searing heat, from one homestead to another. \n \nTheir work includes fetching food and water, cleaning patients and in extreme cases \ntransporting them in wheelbarrows or on relatives\u2019 backs to access roads for \ntransport to the nearest hospital, 30km away. Working outside of supportive health \nand welfare systems, in a climate of hunger, poverty and hopelessness, this group is \nremarkable for their dedication and commitment. \n \nThis paper\u2019s authors encountered Entabeni in our work for HIVAN, an NGO \nconcerned with improving HIV\/AIDS networking in KwaZulu-Natal province. After 18 \nmonths of research and dissemination of findings (Campbell et al, 2005, Campbell et \nal, 2006), Entabeni health volunteers and the area\u2019s traditional chief invited HIVAN to \nhelp establish a three-year project to strengthen local  responses to HIV\/AIDS. This \npaper is written one year into the life of this project. \n \nThe project\u2019s first goal involves facilitating volunteers\u2019 access to skills (home-based \nnursing, counselling, peer education, training and networking) and helping them build \nsupportive relationships with local groupings (e.g. youth and gardening groups) and \nlocal church and traditional leaders. This has been relatively easy to achieve through \ntraining courses, support and mentoring of trainees and the construction of \ncommunication networks between volunteers, community leaders and community \norganisations (Campbell, Nair and Maimane, 2007, discuss this aspect of the \nproject). The status and confidence of the volunteers have risen through organising a \nyouth rally, establishing and staffing a local outreach centre, and running a \u2018cascade\u2019 \nof workshops where trainees eventually serve as trainers, passing skills to growing \nnumbers of local people. Volunteers have continued their daily visits to AIDS-affected \nhouseholds, offering nursing care, counselling and health information. \n \nThe second goal was to create external support structures for volunteers, in the form \nof sustainable working relationships between the community and strategically placed \npartners. The aim of these partnerships would be to:  support the work of the \nvolunteers; facilitate community access to resources and services needed for the \neffective care and support of people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHAs), especially \ngrants and skills building; develop service providers\u2019 understanding of the \ncommunity\u2019s challenges and needs; and secure local and external partners\u2019 \ncommitment to contributing time and resources to meeting small practical goals \ndeveloped by the partnership committee. \n \nIn the course of their formative Entabeni research, and research dissemination \nworkshops that followed, HIVAN scoured the local district for potential project \npartners, identifying six agencies with an interest in participating: local government \ndepartments of health and welfare, the local municipality, a philanthropic business-\nfunded NGO, a counselling NGO and a small missionary NGO. Each welcomed the \nopportunity to work in partnership with such a remote community, saying they had \npreviously lacked contacts and access for this. The HIVAN team planned to use our \nnetworking skills and contacts to facilitate bridge-building between health volunteers \nand these agencies. The challenge of mobilising these agencies to turn their verbal \ncommitments to partnering into concrete actions has been a daunting one. This \nprocess forms the focus of this paper.  \n \nConceptual framework \n \nA substantial literature deals with the role of partnerships in community health. Much \nfocuses on US contexts very different to remote rural South Africa (e.g. Roussos and \nFawcett, 2000; Scott and Thurstone, 2004). Closer to home there is growing \ndiscussion of the role of public-private partnerships in furthering public health goals in \ndeveloping countries in policy documents (e.g. UN AIDS, 2006; South African \nGovernment, 2003) and academic papers (e.g. Haider, 2003; Nishtar, 2004; Richter, \n2004). However , as discussed below, remote communities such as Entabeni may lie \nbeyond the reach of the private sector. For this reason, the reality of our situation \npoints to public sector and NGOs as possible community partners. \n \nThere is also a literature on partnerships between development agencies in the North \nand deprived communities in the South (Eyben, 2006; Lewis, 1998). This is also not \nappropriate for our context, with our partnership\u2019s participants all based in South \nAfrica. Another body of literature discusses the role of partnerships in improving the \nprovision of services to \u2018user\u2019 communities (e.g. Carnwell and Buchanan, 2005). Here \nusers are viewed as beneficiaries of services provided by professionals rather than \nactive participants in service provision as is the case in Entabeni (where volunteers \nactually provide home-based care services).  \n \nOur project seeks to break down traditional distinctions between \u2018users\u2019 and \n\u2018providers\u2019 of health services.  To be effective, partnerships to support grassroots \nresponses to HIV\/AIDS have greater chances of success if they view target \ncommunities as subjects \u2013 equal partners in leading and implementing collaborative \nefforts \u2013 rather than the objects of the efforts of outside professionals (Campbell, \n2003). We distinguish strongly between interventions imposed on communities from \nthe outside, and programmes that facilitate or strengthen local community responses. \nThe Entabeni project aims to work with residents to improve their access the \ncapacity, resources and networks that will enable them to contribute directly to more \neffective HIV\/AIDS management in their isolated, service-poor community. \n \nDespite rhetoric about involving communities, most HIV\/AIDS programmes in sub-\nSaharan Africa are biomedically and\/or behaviourally oriented, designed by outside \nexperts with little reference to the worldviews of beneficiaries, with tokenistic \ncommunity participation (Campbell, 2003). By contrast, our project is community-led \nand community-owned. The volunteer team was already in operation when HIVAN \nencountered the community, the project was conceived of by local people, and the \nproject plan was formulated in close consultation between HIVAN and Entabeni \nresidents. HIVAN\u2019s role is purely one of external change agent, helping local people \ndevelop the resources, partnerships and capacities to optimise the role health \nvolunteers have defined for themselves. \n \nSupporting efforts by marginalized communities to create \u2018health-enabling social \nenvironments\u2019 (Tawil et al., 1995) cannot succeed without effective alliances between \ncommunities and more powerful groupings. Putnam (2000) refers to links between \ncommunities and outside agencies with economic and political power to help them \nmeet their goals as \u2018bridging social capital\u2019. Bourdieu (1986) argues that limited \naccess to social capital (durable networks of socially advantageous inter-group \nrelationships) perpetuates poverty and social disadvantage, hindering people from \nimproving their life circumstan ces. Our project seeks to facilitate community access \nto such networks, which we argue are a key feature of an \u2018AIDS competent \ncommunity\u2019 where residents are best placed to respond appropriately to the epidemic \n(Campbell et al. 2007; Lamboray and Skevington, 2001). \n \nTwo bodies of research are most directly relevant to our concerns. El Ansari \ndiscusses inter-sectoral partnerships for public health in South Africa, emphasising \nthe importance of local ownership of projects (El Ansari and Phillips, 2001a), \nempowerment of health care workers (El Ansari and Phillips, 2001b) and the \nrecognition of grassroots expertise by health professionals (El Ansari, Phillips and \nZwi, 2002). Much of their work draws on large quantitative surveys e.g. of partner \nattitudes. In a methodological paper, El Ansari and Weiss (2005) highlight the need \nsupplement surveys with more  qualitative research. The current paper locates itself \nwithin this gap - presenting an in-depth case study of the challenges facing an \nHIV\/AIDS-related partnership aiming to strengthen local  responses to HIV\/AIDS in a \nrural community. \n \nThe second body of relevant research is Campbell\u2019s (2003) case study of a multi-\nstakeholder partnership to support HIV-prevention in a South African mining \ncommunity. She highlights five features of an effective partner: commitment to \nHIV\/AIDS management and partnership, conceptualisation of HIV\/AIDS as a social \ndevelopment issue, incentive to participate in the partnership, mechanisms for \npartner accountability to target communities, and agency capacity to make a \nmeaningful contribution (especially funding and trained personnel). A successful \npartnership should also have access to the organisational infrastructure necessary to \norganise and host partner meetings and co-ordinate partner efforts. We return to \nthese points below. \n \nBuilding partnerships: from rhetoric to reality \n \nWe now discuss our attempts to mobilise the six agencies who emerged as potential \npartners in HIVAN\u2019s 18 months of research and community consultation with the \nEntabeni community. Partnerships move through three stages: formation, \nimplementation and maintenance (El Ansari and Phillips, 2001b). The focus of this \npaper is the \u2018formation\u2019 stage, the process of recruiting partners to participate. Our \nfindings draw on several contacts we had with each partner: an initial one-to-one \nresearch interview; partners\u2019 participation in workshops to discuss research findings; \nindividual meetings between partner representatives and the first author to discuss \npossible participation in the partnership; and where it occurred, partners\u2019 participation \nin our two preliminary partnership meetings. Three HIVAN staff also kept detailed \nfield diaries throughout this period. \n \nTo recap, within the public sector there were three distinct partner groupings:  \nDepartment of Health (hospitals, a local clinic, and a local primary health care \nfacility); \nDepartment of Welfare; \nMunicipality (district government).  \nOne potential partner represented the private sector: \nThe philanthropic wing of the regional Chamber of Commerce. \nTwo were from civil society:  \nEntabeni\u2019s local social development committee spearheaded by a Scandinavian \nmissionary; \nThe regional branch of a national counselling charity. \nEach is discussed in turn. \n \nPotential public sector partners \n \nOur research highlighted that Entabeni residents were failing to access government \nhealth and welfare services. We hoped the partnership would provide communication \nchannels through which agencies could inform community members about their \nservices, and community members could feed back information about problems in \naccessing services, and gaps in service provision. Ideally the outcome of this \ndialogue would be increased public sector responsiveness to community needs, and \nimproved community access to services and grants. Public sector agencies have a \nstrong policy mandate from the central South African government to engage in such \ndialogue with communities, and as already stated, every partner initially expressed \nenthusiasm for project participation. What types of obstacles prevented them turning \ntheir verbal commitment into action? \n \nDepartment of Health \n \nEntabeni lies at the boundaries of three hospital catchment areas. Hospitals are vital \nfor treating AIDS-related opportunistic infections, and over time will be involved in \nrolling out antiretroviral drugs as these gradually become more available. With few \nroads, and limited or unaffordable transport, many find it difficult to access hospitals \nat all. For many who do get there, the AIDS services are difficult to find. The HIVAN \nteam spent frustrating time following the \u2018yellow feet\u2019  that would allegedly lead them \nto the AIDS service in one hospital, only to find we were walking around in circles.  \n \nIn initial interviews, hospital superintendents lauded the potential of the Entabeni \nproject, saying that improved communication with remote communities could \nincrease their ability to offer effective medical care. However the best overworked \nhospital managers could do was to send nursing sisters to represent them at \npartnership meetings \u2013 who lacked the decision-making power required by an \neffective partner representative. When asked to feed back project information to their \nsenior managers, they said they would gladly deliver letters from HIVAN to senior \nhospital officials, but had no influence over whether these would be read or acted on. \n \nA specific Primary Health Care (PHC) Nurse had long been allocated to Entabeni, \ntravelling in a mobile clinic around the areas served by a large district hospital. Her \nrole is explicitly defined as supporting volunteer carers, and prior to the project she \nhad established monthly meetings with Entabeni volunteers, collecting written reports \nof each month\u2019s work. \n \nWith low literacy and limited access to pen and paper, volunteers battled to compile \nthese reports. In research interviews they complained they had never received any \nfeedback from this nurse. The nurse told us she filed these reports away \u2013  \nperiodically passing on summaries of them to her supervisor. She in turn said she \nhad never received any feedback from her supervisor on these. When HIVAN \nmembers suggested she might discuss the content of these reports with volunteers, \nadvising them on how to address the numerous problems they reported, she said \nsuch a course of action had not occurred to her, but that she would do so in the \nfuture.  \n \nIn this and many other contacts with public service officials, it is clear that they lack \nthe skills and channels to liase with both target communities and supervisors. HIVAN \nis currently working with the PHC nurse to develop strategies for supporting \nvolunteers, including giving them regular feedback and guidance. HIVAN has also \nliased with the nurse\u2019s supervisor to reassure the nurse that her supervisor approves \nof these new developments. \n \nThere is a district AIDS office located in the nearest town, which pays a small stipend \nto the leader of the volunteers. On hearing he had never had formal contact with this \noffice, HIVAN suggested he approach them for advice on various problems facing the \nvolunteers. His visit to this office was greeted with hostile incredulity. The agency \nofficial expressed anger that a community representative should approach the office, \nsaying that she would initiate any contact that was necessary. She refused to talk to \nhim, saying he was wasting Department money by being away from the community \nhe was paid to serve, and reducing his stipend as a penalty for \u2018wasting\u2019 the day. \n \nDepartment of Welfare \n \nMany people lacked skills to access welfare grants, with others unable to afford \ntransport to the welfare office. Those who managed to gather the necessary \ndocumentation and fill in the necessary forms sometimes waited for years before \ngrants materialised.  \n \nThe regional Department of Welfare (DoW) faces a strong national policy directive to \nimplement social development approaches to HIV\/AIDS. However, the area\u2019s \ndesignated social worker did not have any social development skills, trained only to \nimplement one-to-one counselling and grant allocation from his office desk. He had \nnever been to Entabeni. Whilst he appreciated the potential value of the project, he \ntold us he couldn\u2019t see any way of fitting project participation into his current working \nlife.  \n \nAt the time of writing HIVAN is working with him to develop community outreach \nstrategies, and trying to contact his supervisors to discuss DoW involvement in the \nEntabeni partnership. This is endlessly time-consuming, involving on-going and, to \ndate, unsuccessful attempts to telephone, email and fax DoW officials to organise a \nmeeting. \n \nMunicipality \n \nWe initially had high hopes of the Municipality (local government).A senior official \nquickly grasped the opportunities the project offered for contact with a remote \ncommunity (after the HIVAN team alerted him to Entabeni\u2019s existence on the \n\u2018catchment area\u2019 map on his wall). He enthusiastically attended early partnership \ndiscussions, making insightful contributions \u2013 saying that the project could serve as a \nmunicipality model of \u2018best practice\u2019 for HIV\/AIDS work in poor communities. \n \nHaving the support of a well-informed senior official, with a sound appreciation of the \nvalue of partnerships, was a boost for the project in its early stages. However, over \ntime it became clear that his ability to act was limited  by resource constraints and the \nvast geographical area the municipality is expected to support. After many \nunsuccessful phone calls to contact him for a meeting, his secretary said he was \u2018 \ndrowning in work\u2019, having been allocated 60 new projects for the coming year, with \nno extra personnel. Furthermore it emerged that his ability to help a single innovative \nproject was limited by the competitive local councillors he had to answer to. They \nrefused to support his plan to devote resources to a promising project in a single \ncommunity \u2013 irrespective of its potential value as a pilot project, insisting that any \nassistance given to one community should be given to all. \n \nDespite limitations we hope that he will serve as a valuable ally to attend occasional \npartnership meetings and provide limited help on particular occasions (e.g. he has \noffered the assistance of an international volunteer he will be mentoring for one \nyear). \n \nOur contacts with the municipality have highlighted the limited role Entabeni\u2019s elected \ncouncillor has historically played in accessing municipality resources, and feeding his \nconstituency\u2019s views into municipality meetings. The project plans to work with him to \ndevelop this role. \n \nBuilding partnerships with the public sector? \n \nOur experiences suggest that volunteers are constrained by a public sector context \nthat actively hampers effective grassroots empowerment. In HIVAN\u2019s role as External \nChange Agent, every aspect of attempts to involve public sector partners has been \ntime-consuming and stressful. Many constraints limit the ability of public servants to \nexercise the flexibility and initiative needed to make public services more responsive \nto local needs. \n \nAs discussed above, the project was welcomed in meetings with senior civil servants, \nbut due to pressure of work, they directed us to the more junior officials directly \nresponsible for Entabeni. These ranged from skilled and talented individuals offering \nservices in almost impossible conditions with little supervision or support \u2013 to those \nwho were underemployed or disorganised, lacking training and\/or motivation to \naddress the pressing social problems facing them every day. For example, a full-time \nworker on a local government poverty-alleviation programme said he seldom worked \nfor more than two hours a day, not knowing what to do, and with no accessible \nsupervisor. \n  \nEven the most effective junior staff were hampered by bureaucracy. Many found it \nimpossible to get permission to attend the partnership meetings. E.g. the sister in a \nregional Voluntary Counselling and Testing facility was keen to attend meetings and \nto include Entabeni in her programme, but could not do so without the permission of \nher District Manager \u2013 to whom she had no direct access. It took HIVAN six months, \n10 phone messages and 8 emails to get a response from the manager\u2019s office. Even \nthose who managed to get permission to attend partnership meetings often had \nlimited access to agency cars \u2013 essential for accessing this remote area. \n \nLimited communication between junior and senior civil servants made it difficult for \njuniors to incorporate partnership participation into their existing job descriptions. \nSenior officials were often too busy to talk to them. But most importantly the \ninstitutional culture did not accommodate the possibility that junior staff members \nmight have anything of value to say, with very limited opportunities for new ideas to \nmove up the power hierarchy. Given that more junior staff tend to interact with \ngrassroots communities, and are best placed to report their views back to their \nagencies,  this culture limits opportunities for grassroots views to be heard in the  \nhealth or welfare sector. \n \nOverall there appeared to be an overall climate of demoralisation and hopelessness \namongst the civil servants we encountered \u2013 with the scale of the problems facing \nthem and their lack of skills to address these (see also McIntyre and Klugman, 2003). \n \nPotential Private Sector Partnerships \n \nThere is currently much emphasis on the private sector\u2019s potential to contribute to \nsocial development programmes (UN AIDS, 2006; Haider, 2003; Nishtar, 2004; \nRichter, 2004). Entabeni is some distance from regional towns and businesses. \nHowever, HIVAN made a promising link with a philanthropic NGO funded by the \nregional Chamber of Commerce. In the project\u2019s early stages we hoped they would \nprovide stipends for some volunteers. The NGO director was positive about the \nproject, actively participating in a HIVAN research dissemination workshop and \nmaking several offers of assistance. However, she resigned shortly afterwards. \nSubsequent contacts with her colleagues suggested she had not discussed these \noffers with her organisation. They said their brief was to prioritise the immediate \nvicinity of their town, and that they lacked resources to support such a remote \ncommunity. Also that the NGO had a new five-year funding plan, which made it \nimpossible for them to take on unbudgeted commitments. Our experience suggests \nthe need for a high dose of realism about the potential of the public sector to \ncontribute to development in remote areas. \n \nNon-government organisations \n \nThere is a long history of NGOs supporting social development programmes \u2013 with \nstrategies ranging from top-down (replicating public sector programmes and not \nfacilitating grassroots mobilisation) to bottom up (supporting communities in roles \nsuch as advocacy and service delivery in remote areas) (Desai, 2002). To date, the \nmost promising partners in the Entabeni Project have been two NGOs \u2013 both small, \nunder-funded and run by deeply committed individuals.  \n \nEntabeni Development Project \n \nThis group is coordinated by a lone Scandinavian missionary who raised a small \ngrant and came to Entabeni several years ago, working with local people to set up a \ncr\u00e8che, vegetable gardens, craft projects and a hospice for AIDS patients \u2013 built on \nchurch land by local people, and staffed by community volunteers. She also provides \na small stipend for a few health volunteers.  \n \nShe works painstakingly slowly out of her deep commitment to community ownership \nof development, and takes no personal credit for the group\u2019s achievements. She is \ndriven by strong religious convictions, personal enthusiasm, a willingness to live in an \nisolated place with few amenities \u2013 and most of all her ability to see possibilities for \nchange and growth in impossibly difficult conditions. \n \nShe has been a tremendous asset to the Entabeni partnership: making financial \ncontributions to project activities (e.g. to buy meat for project events); making her \nhome available for meetings; and her car available to transport young people to skills \ntraining sessions. With her keen understanding of bottom-up social development, her \nideas have been a constant resource. For example, she and her development \ncommittee conceptualised a successful youth rally to publicise a schools-based peer \neducation programme run by volunteers. Most of all, her enthusiasm and motivation \nhave served as a constant source of inspiration to project participants. \n \nCounselling NGO \n \nOur second very effective partner has been the local branch of a national counselling \nNGO. The director is a retired business woman who lives in a nearby town. She \nraises her own funds, draws a minimal salary and is dynamic, articulate and \nconfident. \n \nFrom the early stages she has attended project meetings, listened carefully to the \ncommunity\u2019s accounts of their needs, and almost immediately volunteered to provide \nappropriate courses for volunteers, and  monitoring and support services for trainees. \nShe has worked with local residents to establish a health outreach centre in a \nbuilding loaned to the project by a local leader, which she has equipped. She delivers \non commitments, seldom misses a project meeting or function, and is a constant \nsource of useful ideas. She has also linked the project to her wide network of \ncontacts in the region. \n \nSustaining the inputs of local NGOs? \n \nSmall NGOs are flexible, fashioned around being immediately responsive to local \nneeds. Staff often work for little or no payment, motivated by personal dedication, \ninspired by a vision of a better world. They operate on tight budgets, relying heavily \non individual inputs.  \n \nThe challenge is how to make this work sustainable over the long term \u2013 a key \nproject goal. This would eventually mean institutionalising project activities within \nmore permanent and stable agency structures, probably public sector structures, \ngiven that the effectiveness of small hand-to-mouth NGOs often depends on non-\ndurable resources such as the dedication of individual staff members and unstable \nfunding sources. The challenges of handing work of this nature from relatively \naffluent individuals, driven by personal convictions, to civil servants facing the \nstresses of poorly paid jobs and difficult working conditions, remains a strong one. \n \nThe role of the External Change Agent (ECA) in partnership formation \n \nWhilst the role of ECAs is frequently discussed in the community development \nliterature (Chambers, 1983; Mansuri and Rao, 2004; Van Klinken, 2003), we are not \naware of any discussions of this role in relation to HIV\/AIDS management. We turn to \nexamine the role the first author has played as HIVAN team leader. \n \nWe have already outlined challenges facing partnership formation in Entabeni, and \nthe longer-term outcome of these efforts remains to be seen. However, we can say \nwith confidence that without HIVAN\u2019s role as ECA, little or none of the networking \noutlined above could have happened. HIVAN has devoted endless time, energy and \ntenacity to the challenge of mobilising partners. In many ways we are unusually \nqualified to carry out this role \u2013 a three person team with high levels of academic, \ncommunity development and networking experience, backed up by 18 months of \nprior research and dialogue with local residents and potential external partners. If \nHIV\/AIDS management experts are to continue to advocate partnerships as a key \nstrategy for HIV\/AIDS management, we believe there is a need for much greater \nacknowledgement of the resource-intensive nature of partnership formation. \n \nHIVAN has played the key role in identifying potential partners, convincing them of \nthe rationale for partnership working, and keeping contact over time. Administratively \nthis has been a mammoth task. E.g. Several public sector contacts do not keep \ndiaries, and individuals are often unable to commit to attending meetings in advance. \nPeople may give incomplete contact details  \u2013 such as the telephone number of their \nagency switchboard, without their personal extension, so that when HIVAN attempts \nto ring them, the switchboard operators are unable to connect us. Contact fax \nmachines don\u2019t always work. One key nursing sister is too busy to talk on the phone \nduring the day, only contactable at home after 9.30pm. \n \nParticipants report that partnership meetings have provided a unique opportunity for \ninteraction between disparate groups, many of whom had never met before (e.g. \nofficials from different branches of the Department of Health responsible for \nEntabeni). Furthermore many public sector participants report that the partnership \nmeetings have given them their first opportunity to hear the views of their target \ncommunity members. Partners also value informal networking opportunities during \ntea breaks at meetings, where discussion is loud and animated. \n \nHIVAN has also engaged in face-to-face discussions with individual partners to \nidentify latent social development skills and to brainstorm ways to build community \ninteraction and support into their existing work-plans. Here, a key challenge has been \nto motivate public servants who may have \u2018lost their edge\u2019 over years of working in a \npressured and de-motivating environment. A HIVAN team member has referred to \nthe way in which these face-to-face meetings can bring the \u2018sparkle\u2019 back into the \neyes of demoralised public servants, as they see the possibility of being able to work \nmore effectively to \u2018make things happen\u2019, realising that HIVAN is willing to support \nthem in developing new ways of working. A key aim of HIVAN is to create a model of \neffective networking, showing that energetic and persistent communication can open \nup new ways of responding to HIV\/AIDS. \n \nConclusion \n \nAs outlined above, the Entabeni project had a two-fold aim: to facilitate volunteer \ntraining and community mobilisation, and to build supportive external partnerships. \nMeeting the first objective continues to be relatively easy. It is the second one that \npresents endless challenges. Our involvement in this work has reversed our na\u00efve \ninitial representation of the community as \u2018the problem\u2019 and the partners as \u2018the \nsolution\u2019. Over time it has become clear that this community has strong capacity to \nlearn skills and mobilise energetically to address the challenges of the epidemic. \nMost often it is the external partners \u2013 particularly those in the public (and private) \nsectors \u2013 that lack the capacity and\/or skills and\/or organisational systems that would \nenable them to support community responses.  \n \nOur experience is directly contrary to the general community development literature, \nwhich often paints a picture of willing and able partners battling to mobilise reluctant \ncommunities (e.g. Blair 2000; Campbell, Cornish and McLean, 2004). On the \ncontrary, we now believe that there is as much need to build \u2018AIDS competence\u2019 \namongst public sector partners as there is to build skills, capacity and networks \nwithin the Entabeni community. \n  \nAssessing progress to date in terms of Campbell\u2019s (2003) criteria for effective \npartners: each partner  committed themselves fully to participation in the project in \nearly interviews and workshops. In terms of conceptualisation, partners appreciated \nthe complexity of the epidemic, their limited ability to make a significant contribution \nin isolation from other agencies, and the urgent need to involve grassroots people in \nefforts to provide more effective support and service provision. In terms of incentives \nfor participation, every partner spoke of their agency\u2019s principled commitment to \ntargeting isolated rural communities for HIV\/AIDS management work, using \ncommunity outreach and social development strategies.  \n \nDespite these factors, aside from our two NGO partners (who had a keen \nappreciation of working closely with communities), public sector representatives \nlacked social development training, and any clear knowledge of how they should go \nabout implementing community outreach approaches. Lack of formal systems for \nrecognising or ensuring accountability to service beneficiaries was one element of \nthis. Agency capacity was the other obstacle: shortages of suitably trained personnel \nand funding limitations in the face of the multiple demands of rural communities \nbattling with HIV\/AIDS in conditions of poverty. A further criterion, which needs to be \nadded to Campbell\u2019s (2003) checklist, is the need for positive morale and confidence \namongst potential partners \u2013 sorely lacking in many of the public sector \nrepresentatives we have encountered in our efforts to date \n \nWithin the context, what are the prospects for on-going efforts to work with these \ngroups? This paper has reported on the first of a proposed three year project, and \nthere are two more years to go. Even at this early stage, the project has been very \nsuccessful in mobilising effective NGO support. Much positive groundwork has been \ndone with some public sector partners, and with more time and persistence some of \nthese relationships should start bearing fruit. Progress has also been made with \nsome individual public sector employees around morale-building and assistance in \nthinking through ways in which they might respond more effectively to community \nneeds. The primary health care nurse is giving valued monthly feedback to health \nvolunteers, with the blessing of her supervisor. A senior municipality official is a \nvociferous supporter of the project in principle if not in practice, and has identified it \nas a potential model of best practice for other communities. \n \nFurthermore, whilst the HIVAN team have found the process of partnership building \nlaborious and challenging, grassroots Entabeni residents have a long history of \nbattling to gain public sector support in addressing their life challenges. Community \nrepresentatives have attended almost all of HIVAN\u2019s meetings with external partners. \nThey do not have unrealistic expectations of what the partnership project will \nachieve, and place an extremely high value on each of the very small steps that the \npartnership formation process has taken so far. This illustrates one of the benefits of \nfollowing a \u2018facilitation\u2019 rather than an \u2018intervention\u2019 strategy. It gives project \nparticipants the space to formulate  small steps, which are in line with what can \nrealistically be achieved in terms of existing capacity (both within and outside the \ncommunity) and to appreciate the achievement of small gains, rather than to \ncontinually  be striving to achieve grandiose and externally imposed goals, and to \nlose sight of significant but small developments along the way (Alinsky, 1973; Wieck, \n1984). \n \nWhilst we do not undermine the challenges facing the project in building sustainable \npartnership structures once the HIVAN team withdraws in two years time, formal \nstructures do exist for sustainability. The current project plans visualise the \nestablishment of a permanent structure spanning four agencies. This would be \ncoordinated by the municipality, and include Entabeni\u2019s dedicated social worker, the \nprimary health care nurse, and hopefully the counselling NGO \u2013 who would meet \nregularly with community representatives on an on-going basis.  \n \nWhat are the implications of these experiences for practice and research in the \npartnerships field? In relation to international debates about the practice of HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement in resource-poor settings, we hope to have illustrated the urgent need \nfor more attention to be given to the complexity and resource-intensive nature of \npartnership building by health and development agencies concerned with HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement. Whilst we have no doubt that partnerships have a crucial role in \nfighting the epidemic, much greater attention needs to be paid to the need for \nsuitably qualified and dedicated external change agents in facilitating their \ndevelopment. In relation to the practice of HIV\/AIDS management in South Africa, \nour findings point to the urgent need for the government to give much higher priority \nto the promotion of social development capacity in health- and welfare-related public \nsector agencies to enable them to support communities in responding to the \nchallenges of the epidemic. This is particularly urgent in rural areas where people \nhave very limited access to services (Scott, Chopra, Conrad and Ntuli, 2005).  \n \nOur case study contributes to urgently needed qualitative studies of factors that \nintervene between partnership ideals and practice in the HIV\/AIDS field. Whilst the \ngeneralisability of case study findings from one setting to another is best judged on a \ncase by case basis according to the judgement of skilled social researchers or \nactivists (Flyvberg, 2001), we hope and believe that colleagues researching and \nseeking to build partnerships in a range of deprived countries and contexts will find \nvalue in  our account of the triumphs and challenges that we have faced in the first \nyear of our partnerships building efforts. If grassroots community involvement is \nindeed a key dimension of effective HIV-prevention and AIDS-care in marginalized \ncommunities, better understandings of how to promote partnerships \u2013 between \ncommunities and those agencies capable of facilitating such involvement  \u2013 remains \none of the biggest single challenges in the fight against HIV\/AIDS. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis article draws on research funded by Atlantic Philanthropies.
