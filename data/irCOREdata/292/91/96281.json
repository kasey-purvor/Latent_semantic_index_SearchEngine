Whilst it is often suggested that AIDS-affected children may be stigmatised by other children, to\ndate no research focuses specifically on child-on-child stigma. Using social representations theory, we\nexplore how Zimbabwean children represent AIDS-affected peers, examining (i) whether or not they\nstigmatise, (ii) the forms stigma takes, and (iii) the existence of non-stigmatising representations that\nmight serve as resources for stigma-reduction interventions. Our interest in identifying both stigmatising\nand non-stigmatising representations is informed by a theory of change which accords a central role to\ncommunity-level debate and dialogue in challenging and reframing stigmatising representations. In late\n2008, 50 children (aged 10e12) were asked to \u201cdraw a picture of a child whose family has been affected\nby AIDS in any way\u201d, and to write short stories about their drawings. Thematic analysis of stories and\ndrawings revealed frequent references to stigmatisation of AIDS-affected children e with other children\nrefusing to play with them, generally keeping their distance and bullying them. However children also\nfrequently showed a degree of empathy and respect for AIDS-affected children\u2019s caring roles and for their\nlove and concern for their AIDS-infected parents. We argue that a key strategy for stigma-reduction\ninterventions is to open up social spaces in which group members (in this case children) can identify the\ndiverse and contradictory ways they view a stigmatised out-group, providing opportunities for them to\nexercise agency in collectively challenging and renegotiating negative representations. Contrary to the\ncommon view that drawings enable children to achieve greater emotional expression than written\nstories, our children\u2019s drawings tended to be comparatively stereotypical and normative. It was in\nwritten stories that children most eloquently expressed meanings and emotions, and an awareness of the\ncomplexity of the scenarios they portrayed.\n\u0001 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Introduction\nChildren are increasingly targeted in HIV\/AIDS programming\ndue to the growing number of HIV positive children and growing\nrecognition of children\u2019s role in responding to the epidemic,\nparticularly as supportive and caring actors (Skovdal, 2010;\nSkovdal, Ogutu, Aoro, & Campbell, 2009). Children\u2019s stigmatisa-\ntion of each other is a vitally important and under-researched\narea (Deacon & Stephney, 2007). We use children\u2019s drawings and\nstories to investigate their representations of AIDS-affected\nchildren. Viewing children as competent social actors, constantly\nengaged in the construction and reconstruction of the social\nrepresentations that give meaning to their experience, we aim to).\nAll rights reserved.highlight the diversity and complexity of children\u2019s representa-\ntions. We do this in the interest of informing stigma-reduction\nprogrammes that seek to acknowledge and strengthen the exis-\ntence of positive and empowering representations of socially\nexcluded groups that may often exist alongside stigmatising\nones.\nGoffman (1963: 13) defines stigma as \u201can attribute that is\nsignificantly discrediting, which in the eyes of society, serves to\nreduce the person who possesses it\u201d. Building on this, we draw on\nDovidio, Major, and Crocker\u2019s (2003) conceptualisation of stigma as\nthe blend of affective, cognitive and behavioural responses to those\nbearing \u2018discrediting attributes\u2019, constructed within a collectively\nnegotiated body of social knowledge or representational field. In\nthis paper, we seek to characterise the representational field in\nwhich children\u2019s responses to their AIDS-affected peers are\nnegotiated.\nC. Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985976The form and content of stigma varies across cultures and socio-\neconomic contexts (Deacon & Stephney, 2007; Norman, Abreu,\nCandelaria, & Sala, 2009). However, whatever shape it takes,\nstigma presents a major barrier to effective HIV\/AIDS management.\nBan Ki-moon (2008: 1), UN secretary general, attributes the\ncontinuing and devastating impact of AIDS to stigma, \u201cthe silent\nkiller of AIDS\u201d, identifying it as the most important barrier to public\naction. Numerous studies testify to its devastating effects. In South\nAfrica for example, Campbell, Nair, Maimane, and Sibiya (2008)\nfound that fear of disclosing HIV status hindered people\u2019s access\nto the already limited care or support that was available. Stigma has\nbeen identified as the chief barrier to uptake of antiretroviral\nmedication and adherence for people living with HIV and AIDS\n(PLWHA) (Weiser et al., 2003).\nAlthough the HIV prevalence in Zimbabwe has fallen in recent\nyears from 25.3% in 1997 to 13.7% in 2009 (Zimbabwe Ministry of\nHealth and Child Welfare, 2009), numerous challenges continue\nto face the children whose parents develop AIDS and\/or become\norphaned \u2013 one of which is stigma. Using drawings and stories, we\nexplore how Zimbabwean children represent AIDS-affected peers,\nin the interests of examining (i) whether or not they stigmatise,\n(ii) what forms stigma might take, (iii) the existence of non-stig-\nmatising representations that might serve as a resource for stigma-\nreduction interventions.\nChildren\u2019s attitudes to PLWHAs\nChildren may express, understand and respond to AIDS-related\nstigma differently from adults (Deacon & Stephney, 2007). Little is\nknown about how children stigmatise AIDS-affected children.\nHowever, a growing body of literature has explored children\u2019s atti-\ntudes to PLWHA in general e and we take this literature as our\nstarting point. Studies have highlighted the relationship between\nHIV\/AIDS knowledge and children\u2019s attitudes towards PLWHA. In\nMali for example, Castle (2004) showed that school children\u2019s stig-\nmatisation of PLWHAwas associated with misconceptions that AIDS\ncould be transmitted through casual social contacte views also held\nby community elders, parents and school teachers. Letamo (2004)\nfound children in Botswana to fear social contact with PLWHA,\nwith children saying that HIV positive teachers should not be\nallowed to teach. However, these children were still willing to care\nfor sick relatives and were more likely to stigmatise PLWHA who\nwere not close relatives. In South Africa, Maughan-Brown (2006)\nfound the prevalence of negative judgements and fear of HIV\ninfectionwere greater than negative behavioural intentions towards\nPLWHA. In Swaziland, Buseh, Park, Stevens, McElmurry, and Kelber\n(2006) found gender to be a significant factor in predicting stigma.\nBoys were less sympathetic to PLWHA than girls, showing higher\nlevels of stigmatising attitudes. Peer influence, conceptualised as the\nnumber of discussions children had with friends about HIV\/AIDS,\nwas associated with lower stigma levels (ibid.) e suggesting that\ninterventions should create social spaces facilitating dialogue about\nAIDS and renegotiation of gender roles.\nChildren not only stigmatise, but can also be stigmatised against,\noften undermining their psychosocial well-being (Cluver &\nGardner, 2007; Makame, Ani, & Grantham-McGregor, 2002).\nStudies in South Africa explore the sources and outcomes of stigma,\nand its impacts on the mental health of AIDS-affected children.\nStrode and Barrett (2001) document the stigmatisation of AIDS-\naffected children by their extended families, communities, school\npeers and health and social services, outlining some of its conse-\nquences, including reduced access to care and support, increased\nvulnerability to poverty and exploitation, fear of disclosing HIV\nstatus, feelings of powerlessness and emotional pain. Bullying and\nthe stigmatisation of AIDS-affected children have been associatedwith psychosocial distress (Cluver & Orkin, 2009). Teachers have\nobserved bullying of AIDS-affected children by other children\n(Baggaley, Sulwe, Chilala, & Mashambe, 1999) and Hejoaka\u2019s (2009)\nstudy of mothers with AIDS-affected children in Burkino Faso\nhighlighted children\u2019s fear that if their peers knew about their HIV\nstatus they would not play with them.\nWhilst references to child-on-child stigma have been made in\npassing, no studies have explicitly investigated it. To address this\ngap we examine children\u2019s representations of AIDS-affected chil-\ndren to develop our understandings of what drives and mitigates\nAIDS-related stigma as well as informing the on-going challenge of\ndeveloping effective stigma-reduction programmes among chil-\ndren. We conclude by discussing our findings in relation to chil-\ndren\u2019s capacities to exercise agency through resisting the\ninternalisation of stigmatising social representations, and showing\nempathy and solidarity for AIDS-affected children.\nConceptual framework\nSocial representations theory (SRT) (cf. Moscovici, 1984) provides\na productive lens for examining the sense peoplemake of their social\nworlds. Moscovici (1973: xiii) defines social representations as\n\u201csystems of values, ideas and practices with a two-fold function;\nfirst, to establish an order which will enable individuals to orientate\nthemselves in their material and social world and to master it; and\nsecondly to enable communication to take place among the\nmembers of a community by providing them with a code for social\nexchange and for naming and classifying the various aspects of their\nworld and their individual and group history.\u201d Common-sense\nknowledge is a product of local context. Social representations are\ndynamic, rather than static, systems of social knowledge. They are\nconstantly negotiated and renegotiated in the course of daily inter-\nactions between people, groups and institutions in particular\nhistorical settings through dialogue and communication as people\ngo about their daily lives. The process of representation involves\na constant tension between stability (the possibility of reproducing\ntraditional understandings) and change (the possibility of trans-\nforming these through constructing novel ways of making sense of\nthe world). SRT\u2019s emphasis on the potential for representations to\nchange is particularly relevant to our interest in the possibility of\nchallenging and transforming stigmatising representations through\nstigma-reduction programmes.\nSRT has been used to explore stigma in relation to the \u2018othering\u2019\nof the mentally ill, notably in Jodelet\u2019s (1991) classic study of\ninteractions between the mentally ill and their carers (French\nvillagers paid to lodge psychiatric patients in their homes). Repre-\nsentations of the mentally ill as \u2018other\u2019 shaped the distancing and\ndiscriminatory rituals and practices that shaped carers\u2019 interactions\nwith patients. According to Jodelet, carers constructed these\ndistancing representations and practices as symbolic boundaries\nbetween themselves and what they experienced as the unpre-\ndictable, strange or potentially frightening behaviour of the\npatients. Representational boundaries give individuals a sense of\ncomfort and safety in a deeply unpredictable social world, in which\nhuman beings must constantly construct psychological defences\nagainst the threat of chaos and disruption. Stigmatising represen-\ntations also helped the carers cope with the \u2018identity threat\u2019 posed\nby the nagging and terrible possibility that they too might one day\nbe vulnerable to a strange and disturbing affliction (Joffe, 1999).\nCrawford (1994) argues that AIDS, associated with the taboo issues\nof death and sexuality, constitutes a similar \u2018symbolic threat\u2019. AIDS\nstigma is driven as much by peoples\u2019 dread of \u2018symbolic contagion\u2019\nas of physical contagion, with the existence of AIDS exacerbating\nthe constant unconscious fear of death and disruption that char-\nacterise human existence (Treichler, 1999).\nC. Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985 977Various dimensions of AIDS stigma are shaped by wider power\ninequalities (Parker & Aggleton, 2003). These dimensions may\ninclude the fear of physical contagion (instrumental stigma), the\nassociation of AIDS with immorality and shame (symbolic stigma),\nthe idea that AIDS-affected people do not deserve access to health\ncare or services (resource-based stigma) and the stigmatisation of\npeople through their association with diseased relatives or friends\n(courtesy stigma) (Maughan-Brown, 2006).\nMethodology\nEthical approval was granted by the Medical Research Council of\nZimbabwe and a research committee at the London School of\nEconomics. We followed UNICEF (2002) guidelines on undertaking\nresearch with children and written consent (for their participation\nand the publication of their stories and drawings) was obtained\nfrom all participating children and their parents\/guardians.\nStudy participants\nFifty Shona-speaking children aged 10e12 participated. Chil-\ndren of this age have not yet reached full sexual maturity, and most\nwill not yet be sexually active. As a result, the sexual anxieties that\ndrive AIDS stigmamight take a rudimentary form relative to adults,\nmaking this age group particularly ripe for anti-stigma interven-\ntions before the emotions associated with sexual relations have\nfully consolidated. Furthermore, many children of this age have the\nskills and training to express ideas and feelings inwriting as well as\nthrough drawings. Data were collected in September 2008, by the\nthird author (ZM), a Shona-speaking Zimbabwean who is both an\nacademic social psychologist and experienced social worker.\nParticipants constituted a convenience sample, drawn from rural\nand urban areas in which she has lived and worked. Although\nparticipants were purposively selected to ensure an equal gender\nand rural\/urban divide, no differences emerged in our analysis of\nthe stories and writing produced by these groups, so we pooled the\ndata for our analysis. Children were not selected on the basis of, or\nasked to declare, whether they themselves were living with HIV\/\nAIDS or whether their own families were affected by HIV\/AIDS.\nData collection\nWe used an open-ended approach to elicit children\u2019s own voices\nand perspectives (James & Prout, 1997). Besides being a fun\nparticipatory activity for children, drawings have traditionally been\nused by psychologists to explore the meanings children give to\ntheir emotional, mental and intellectual experiences (Backett-\nMilburn & McKie, 1999). Drawings encourage children to talk\nabout their inner and social worlds, communicating thoughts and\nfeelings they may find difficult to articulate in speech or writing\ndue to their limited vocabulary and inability to articulate their\nemotions verbally (Pridmore & Bendelow, 1995). However,\nPridmore and Bendelow (1995: 219) argue that an \u2018imaginative\ncombination of drawing and writing\u2019 should be used to counter-\nbalance the strengths and limitations of drawings alone. This\ncombination of methods also allowed less literate children to focus\ntheir energies on drawing if they felt less comfortable writing.\nChildren were asked to produce the drawings and stories individ-\nually in theirownhomes.Afterexplaining the studyandgoing through\nformal consent procedures, the researcher asked guardians and others\nto vacate the room whilst drawing and writing were in progress.\nChildren were asked to \u201cdraw a picture of a child whose family has\nbeen affected by AIDS in any way\u201d. No further prompts were given, so\nchildren were free to express their views e either from their own\nexperience, or from third person or fictitious stories. Thereafterchildrenwere asked towrite short stories about the drawings. In eight\ninstances children with limited literacy opted to narrate their stories\nverbally to the researcher who transcribed them. This generated 50\ndrawings and 50 stories. There was great variation in the quality and\nlength of drawings and stories, with the latter ranging from 50 to 500\nwords. Thirty-nine children chose to write in English, and eleven in\nShona (later translated into English by the researcher).\nData analysis\nGiven that social representations are properties of social groups\nrather than of individuals, we did not aim to make links between\nindividual children\u2019s accounts and their individualised personal\nexperiences, but rather to map out the stock of symbolic resources\nused by our informants tomake sense of the impact of the epidemic\non children. The entire data corpus constitutes our unit of analysis,\nrather than individual children\u2019s accounts. Furthermore, in line\nwith our social representations approach, the aim of our data\ncollection was to map out the diversity of responses in the data set,\nrather than to generate accounts of stereotypical attitudes held by\nall the research participants.\nDrawings and accompanying stories were analysed as a single\nunit. To minimise imposing the analysts\u2019 own interpretations on\nthe drawings, the story was read first to throw light on the content\nof the child\u2019s written account of the picture. Against this back-\nground, each drawing was examined using a three-step analytical\nframework (see Fig. 1) which started by exploring how AIDS-\naffected children were represented in the drawing. An initial\nreading of the stories and preliminary viewing of drawings sug-\ngested that children\u2019s representations could be classified as nega-\ntive (indicating stigmatisation of the portrayed child), positive\n(indicating solidarity and support) or both. The second step\ntherefore involved exploring the content (stigma and\/or solidarity\/\nsupport) of the drawing. The final step involved classifying any\naccount that threw light on the social psychological factors driving\nor mitigating stigma, drawing on our conceptualisations of the\n\u2018AIDS competent community\u2019 (Campbell, Nair, Maimane, & Gibbs,\n2009; Skovdal & Campbell, in press) to identify social psycholog-\nical factors that might serve as resources for stigma-mitigation.\nThe five questions guiding the analysis of drawings are pre-\nsented in Fig. 1 alongside examples of \u2018issues of interest\u2019 we looked\nfor as we analysed them. Our identification of issues of interest was\ninformed by an iterative process taking account of insights\nemerging from our literature review as well as our preliminary\nreadings of the stories and drawings. We paid attention to the\nsetting (e.g. community, hospital, homestead) as well as the activ-\nities carried out by people in the drawings.\nUsing Attride-Stirling\u2019s (2001) thematic network analysis all\nwritten stories were read and re-read and topics emerging from\ndrawings and stories were coded, leading to 32 codes. The frequency\nof each code across the entire data set is noted in Table 1, as is a list of\nthe issues that were classified within each code. Following this\nprocess, codes were grouped together into basic themes, which were\neventually clustered into three organising themes that highlight the\nrepresentationalfield inwhich children's viewsandattitudes towards\nAIDS-affected children are negotiated. Our presentation of findings\nwill reflect the structure of this coding framework (see Table 1).\nFindings\nRepresentations of AIDS\nChildren\u2019s knowledge of AIDS\nChildren often had accurate factual knowledge.

Three-step analysis of drawings.\nC. Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985978transmitted primarily amongst high risk groups (e.g. sex workers),\nothers knew AIDS could affect anyone.\nNowadays there is a deadly disease called AIDS. This disease is\nonly treated but not cured. Anyone can be infected e male,\nfemale, young, old, rich, poor, educated, uneducated from any\ncountry or any religion (Janet, urban).\nThey attributed their knowledge of HIV\/AIDS to the attention\nAIDS receives in Zimbabwe.\nAIDS is a sexually transmitted disease. Health workers, the radio\nand the television are always talking about AIDS (John, rural).\nHowever, alongside accurate knowledge about transmission,\nmany children also exhibited erroneous beliefs, often structured\naround an exaggerated fear of contagion. One commonly held belief\nwas that eating with a PLWHA could lead to HIV transmission.\nAIDS is prevented by not sharing razor blades, needles, syringes\nand by not having sexual intercourse. You must not eat in the\nsame place with a person who has AIDS (James, rural).\nThese parents gave birth to twins. One of them was infected\nwith AIDS. The other child got infected when the other one was\ncoughing and when they were eating together (Tendary, boy,\nrural).\nAt the time of this study a minimal roll-out of antiretroviral\ndrugs (ARVs) had just started. Five children spoke about ARVs and\nthe types of care and support required for drugs to be effective,\nincluding care, love, and a balanced vitamin-rich diet. Two chil-\ndren drew ARVs next to a bedridden AIDS-affected guardian\/\nparent and another family member engaged in caring or cooking\nfood (Fig. 2).\nWe can help this girl by giving her tablets called ARVs. People\nwith AIDS must eat a lot of vitamins. We should give this girl\ncare and love (Martin, urban).\nHe is taking ARV pills. With ARVs he is getting stronger. These\npills require you to eat a balanced diet (Matthew, rural).Men as conduits of AIDS\nMany children spoke of AIDS as a disease spread by \u2018bad\u2019\nbehaviour. Drinking and beer halls were seen as particular\ncontributors here.In the morning my father would go to the beer hall and drink\nbeer and see his girlfriend. My father has too many girlfriends at\nthe beer hall (Everline, rural).\nThis manwas a drunkard. He was well-known in the whole city.\nSometimes he slept with womenwhowere married. He went to\na VCT centre and was tested positive. He did not tell his wife. He\nspread the disease to the whole family (Tatenda, boy, rural).\nMany children referred to men as more likely to engage in \u2018bad\u2019\nbehaviour, causing HIV to spread. Often such men were described\nas \u2018old\u2019, \u2018fat\u2019 or \u2018rich\u2019. Several spoke of younger girls sleeping with\nolder men for gifts.\nLouise lived with her mother. One day she was walking and saw\na car. In the car was an old man. He said get into the car and she\nopened the door and got in. The man asked her to sleep with\nhim at his house and she agreed. She was given sweets and\nchocolates. She was tempted with these since she was a little\ngirl. Soon she fell sick and her mother took her to a VCT centre\nand she was found HIV positive (Chris, urban).Impacts of AIDS\nChildren often mentioned death as an unavoidable outcome of\nHIV\/AIDS. Some depicted grave-stones within homesteads. Whilst\nburying a family member within a homestead is not uncommon,\none child illustrated the link between AIDS and death by depicting\na bedridden personwith AIDS near the graveyard of the homestead\nwhere the child lived (see Fig. 3).\nAside from experiencing death of parents and loved ones, AIDS-\naffected children were represented as having seriously ill and\nbedridden parents for long periods. Nearly half the drawings depic-\nted a bedridden person with AIDS, as Figs. 2e5 show. In addition to\nbeing described as bedridden and \u2018useless\u2019, people living with AIDS\nwere often portrayed as weak, messy, malnourished and ill-looking.\nHe is sleeping outside.

Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985 979The terminal nature of AIDS, if left untreated, dominated\nmany stories and some drawings, in addition to the economic\nand domestic unproductiveness of bedridden parents. Further-\nmore, children often presented themselves as knowledgeable and\nsympathetic to the circumstances of AIDS-affected children, but\nrepresented other children as having irrational fears of\ncontagion.\nRepresentations of negative impacts of AIDS on children\nThree themes dominated accounts of the negative impacts of\nAIDS on children.A compromised childhood\nAIDS-affected children were often represented as busy\nproviding care and sustaining their households.\nAlice spends most of the day cooking, washing, sweeping [.]\nAlice\u2019s mother will call Alice to come and help if she needs to go\nto the toilet. [.] In the morning Alice will cook for her mother\nand shewill bring her food and a bottle of water, a cup and some\npills. She is always busy as a bee, she has no time to rest (Chipo,\nboy, urban).\nMany informants said such children had few opportunities to\nenjoy being a child who attended school regularly, and played with\nFig. 2. Person living with AIDS and on ARVs. Fig. 4. AIDS-affected child busy caring for sick parent.\nC. Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985980friends. Some described AIDS-affected children as hard-working,\nwith little time to rest. As Fig. 4 illustrates, some children drew the\nAIDS-affected child working in their homestead during the day,\na time when children are usually in school. In a context where\neducation is seen as the only route out of poverty, this is particu-\nlarly significant.\nShe does not go to school or go and play with the other children\nbecause her work is more important than playing (Mark, rural).\nSometimes they [AIDS-affected children] do not have time to go\nto school because they need to care for a parent. At school they\nsit at the back of the classroom. The other children don\u2019t get near\nthem and this affects their learning. Also, they are thinking of\ntheir sick parent (Rufaro, girl, urban).\nAs the patched blanket in Fig. 4 symbolises, AIDS-affected children\nwere depicted as living in poverty. Some informants drew AIDS-\naffectedchildrenwith longhair (with stories explaining theycouldnotFig. 3. People bedridden fromafford hair cuts), patched clothing (unable to afford new clothes) and\nthin (unable to afford a good diet). Whilst most drawings and stories\nreferred to a child living with an ailing parent and thus busy with\ncaring duties, a few stories concerned an AIDS-affected child whose\nparents had died and who lived with relatives or other community\nmembers. Children without parents were occasionally described as\nabused and exploited due to the combined stigma of poverty,\norphanhood and AIDS. Abuse included discriminating against\norphaned children in the distribution of food and household chores,\nand failing to offer them the same support as non-orphaned children.\nThe parents of this child died of AIDS. This child is abused by\neveryone. Every person who passed through their place will\nshun the child. The relatives who used to stay with this child\ngave the child less food comparing with others. At times, this\nchild would sleep outside. No one would buy clothes or shoes\nfor this child. The child was told to do all the household chores.AIDS are close to death.\nFig. 5. Drawing of an AIDS-affected child who is crying.\nC. Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985 981Some people would spit and laugh at this child because s\/he is\nan orphan without shoes (Pamela, rural).\nA few spoke of orphaned children as vulnerable to sexual abuse.\nTheylivedhappily (orphanedgirl anduncle)untilonedaywhenthe\nunclecameback fromwork.Heaskedher topackhisclothes.Whilst\npacking he grabbed her and raped her. This uncle is HIV positive.\nThe uncle threatened her not to tell anyone (Mwaita, boy, urban).Psychosocial distress\nThe perceived vulnerability of AIDS-affected children meant\nthat many represented them as distressed and despairing (e.g. one\nchild drew an AIDS-affected child holding her head) or crying (e.g.\nFig. 5). AIDS was occasionally described in stories as a source of\nunhappiness, shattering futures.\nOnce upon a time, Robson was a happy child. But once this\ndreadful and incurable disease, HIV\/AIDS, came into his life, his\nhappiness was shattered. He had nothing to welcome in his life\nexcept a dark future. His goals and dreams were also blocked.\nThe boy\u2019s life was ruined (Fatima, boy, rural).\nAside from removing hopes for a bright future, AIDS-affected\nchildren were sometimes depicted as in a constant state of worry,\nfearing the death of parents or relatives living with AIDS.\nThe child is grieved because the grandmother and grandfather\nare suffering from AIDS, thinking that they might die (Mary,\nrural).\nChildren\u2019s lack of friendship bonds was also seen as having\na negative impact on their psychosocial well-being, leading to\nloneliness and isolation.\nThe girl is lonely, she doesn\u2019t have time to share her thoughts\nand ideas with other girls (Carolyn, rural).\nOstracizing of AIDS-affected children\nIt was not only lack of time that prevented AIDS-affected chil-\ndren from developing friendships. Many informants said childrenwere often afraid to play with AIDS-affected children. Some spoke\nof how children bullied and ostracised AIDS-affected children by\nteasing and calling them names.\nThe two children have no friends. It is because the other children\nrun away from them. They think they will also get HIV from\nplaying with them. These children, when they are free, play by\nthemselves (Rufaro, girl, urban).\nWhen shewent to school her friends scolded and laughed at her.\n[.] and others called her by names (Tatenda, boy, rural).\nIt was not only children that kept a distance from AIDS-\naffected children for fear of contracting HIV. Relatives and\ncommunity members were also reported to mistreat AIDS-\naffected children.\nHer relatives and friends started laughing at her. They thought\nif someone has got AIDS it will be the end of their life or if\nsomeone is taking care of someone with this deadly disease\nthat person will also get infected, but that is not true [.] her\nfriends started teasing her and did not want to play or talk to\nher. She was now the saddest girl in the class. She asked for\nhelp from her relatives but they all turned her down (Jose-\nphine, rural).\nThe people of the community are not giving any support to this\nfamily. They don\u2019t even go and see them because they also think\nthat they will get the virus (Fatima, boy, rural).\nThese representations suggest that AIDS can have a profoundly\nnegative impact on AIDS-affected children, who were portrayed as\nvulnerable to stigmatisation by other children, including fear of\nphysical contact (instrumental stigma), having reduced access to\ncommunity and peer support (resource-based stigma) and being\ntainted by their parent\u2019s or relative\u2019s ailment (courtesy stigma).\nPositive representations of AIDS-affected children\nSocial representations are seldom stereotypical or homogenous,\nreflecting the complexity of the meanings children give to complex\nsituations. Several informants constructed complex and ambiguous\nFig. 6. Drawing of neighbour and \u2018doctor\u2019 (community health worker) visiting an\nAIDS-infected parent.\nC. Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985982representations reflecting both their dread of the plight of AIDS-\naffected children, but also a begrudging respect, even awe, and\ncompassion for the enormity of their life challenges. In addition to\nrepresenting AIDS-affected children as lonely, abused, stigmatised\nand sad, several informants also, or exclusively, depicted AIDS-\naffected children in a positive way.\nSocial support available to AIDS-affected children\nSeveral referred to the support available to AIDS-affected chil-\ndren. They and their sick parents were said to benefit from support\nfrom neighbours, community health workers (see Fig. 6) and rela-\ntives who helped with nursing and caregiving.\nWhen her father is sick relatives always come and visit. This\nmakes him heal in short time. I have learnt that people who are\nHIV positive need love (Nyaradzo, girl, urban).\nMary gets support from community health workers. They\nalways visit her and give her gloves, soap and food. I hope she\nwill be able to keep on caring for her father (Florence, urban).Fig. 7. Child sustaining the householdSome spoke of friendships that AIDS-affected children devel-\noped with other children and how they could take a break from\ncaring activities to play with them. Friends were also mentioned as\nunderstanding and helpful.\nAfter washing the plates he goes to play with his friends. Then\nhe will come back and prepare lunch and talk to his sick father\n(Ngaavongwe, girl, urban).\nAround ten o\u2019clock some male neighbours come and wash\nher father [.] she is never lonely because relatives and\nneighbours assist her [.] She finds it difficult to care for her\nfather, but other children often come to help (Edison, boy,\nurban).\nShe goes to her friend Caroline\u2019s house and together they collect\nwater [.] Caroline understands the situation at Cellestine\u2019s\nhouse so when they come back, she helps Cellestine doing all\nthe house work. Surely a friend in need is a friend indeed.\nCaroline helps Pamela all the time [.] Many things would be\ndifficult for Cellestine, but with Caroline there things are much\nbetter (Janet, urban).Caring children\nWhilst our informants referred to the demanding nature of\nchildren\u2019s caregiving activities, they did not depict AIDS-affected\nchildren as unwilling and \u2018forced\u2019 to care. Some spoke of children\nbeing motivated by love and concern for those living with AIDS,\nincluding concerns about their personal hygiene, diet and the\navailability of drugs.\nEllen has a good heart, she gives her father love and cooks for\nhim everyday (Florance, urban).\nShe spends all day with her father. She tells him about school,\nencourages him to eat good foods and takes him for exercise so\nhis bones will be strong (Matthew, rural).\nEvery day she wakes up and sweeps the yard and the house.\nAfter that she washes the plates and cooks porridge for her\nparents. When she has finished she washes her mother and her\ntwin brother washes their father [.] she always buys fruit forthrough care and domestic work.\nC. Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985 983her parents, such as apples, bananas and oranges. She encour-\nages them to eat them because they are good for human health\n(Lydia, urban).\nMany informants referred to AIDS-affected children engaging in\nincome-generating activities. As depicted in Figs. 2, 4 and 7, many\nchildren were depicted as having access to livelihood sustaining\nresources, including livestock, poultry and farmland. These helped\nchildren support bedridden and economically inactive parents.\nSometimes she went to the garden and started growing vege-\ntables to sell so that they would have money to buy food and\nmedicines for her parents (Josephine, rural).Empathy and respect\nSome informants spoke of AIDS-affected children with respect\nand empathy. Some even reported being envious of the agency of\ntheir caring peers, saying that caregiving children would be pro-\ntected by God\u2019s blessings. Even if they were not envious, they often\nused positive adjectives to describe AIDS-affected children.\nI would like to be as helpful as Tafadawa and Tabudzwa are, as\nGod will not let them grow without blessing (Lydia, urban).\nMary is a tolerant and compassionate girl who is loving to her\nfather. She is an active girl. She is faithful as a dog. She believes\nthat one day her father will be fine (William, rural).\nThe care and concern felt by many children was reflected in the\nadvice some sought to give their AIDS-affected peers.\nI would like to advise children that praying with a person with\nAIDS, sharing a bedroom, sharing toilets, helping that person to\neat, playing games, washing his or her clothes, hugging that\nperson, sitting next to that person or even sharing a plate with\nthat person will not spread AIDS (Janet, urban).\nSome children translated their admiration and respect into\na narrative where the AIDS-affected child excelled in life and\nengaged in activities advocating for social change.\nKaski (AIDS-affected child) started her own anti-stigma pro-\ngramme. The Red Cross offered to pay her school fees. She was\nastonished by the number of people who liked the anti-stigma\nprogramme. Kaski was happy and people started to recognise\nher in the society. Two years later, Kaski passed her form six and\nwent to university. She became a physician and was the first\nperson to prevent stigma in the country (Tatenda, boy, rural).Discussion\nWe have examined how children represent AIDS and AIDS-\naffected children, to advance understandings of whether and how\nchildren stigmatise AIDS-affected peers. Our analysis of drawings\nand stories found the impact of AIDS on children was over-\nwhelmingly presented as negative. Children were depicted as\ndeprived, discriminated against, rejected, \u2018children with no child-\nhood\u2019 and as children with reduced educational opportunities\nimpacting negatively on their future life chances.\nAIDS was represented as a deadly and contagious disease which\ncould be transmitted through casual social contact such as hand-\nshakes or mixing with infected or affected people. These beliefs\nwere said to result in the stigmatisation of AIDS-affected children\nby other children, often through bullying and a refusal to play with\nthem. Fear of contagion has been observed amongst children in\nBurkina Faso (Hejoaka, 2009) and Puerto Rico (Gonzales-Rivera &\nBauermeister, 2007), often attributed to poor understandings of\nHIV transmission (Maughan-Brown, 2006; Sallar, 2009). Howevermany of our child informants had a sound and often sophisticated\nunderstanding of HIV transmission and management, suggesting\nthat stigma was not always driven by factual ignorance. Further-\nmore many informants constructed more complex and ambiguous\nrepresentations that included feelings of admiration, respect and\nempathy.\nAlthough many children spoke of AIDS as something caused by\nsocially condemned behaviours, the children of parents with AIDS\nwere not themselves condemned as immoral by association. On the\ncontrary, reflecting empathy for AIDS-affected children, our infor-\nmants often emphasised the admirable efforts of AIDS-affected\nchildren as they provided care and support for ailing parents. These\nduties earned them respect from other children, reflected in the\npositive and admirable qualities they attributed to caregiving\nchildren.Whilst children have previously been observed to draw on\nrepresentations of care and concern to resist the stigmatisation of\nadults living with HIV\/AIDS (Bhana, 2008; Letamo, 2004), we can\nreport on similar representations for AIDS-affected children.\nFurthermore, many children spoke of the support available to those\naffected by AIDS, including neighbours, relatives and the friends of\nAIDS-affected children.\nContrary to Buseh et al. (2006) who found that Swazi boys\nstigmatised PLWHAmore than girls, we found no differences in the\nrepresentations constructed by male and female informants.\nHowever, our findings did cast interesting light on children\u2019s\nunderstandings of the role of gender in HIV transmission. Much of\nthe stigma literature in SSA suggests that women are widely\nregarded as vectors of HIV transmission (Dilger, 2003; Joffe &\nBettega, 2003). Contrary to this, our informants overwhelmingly\nrepresented men as the vectors of HIV transmission, often through\ntheir involvement in what many children depicted as socially\ncondemned behaviours (e.g. frequenting beer halls, sleeping with\nmany women), and generally using their powerful position to\nexploit and abuse girls. South African children have also repre-\nsented men as the vectors of AIDS in discussions of sexual violence\n(Bhana, 2009).\nIn this paper we have explored the representational field in\nwhich children\u2019s responses to AIDS-affected children are negoti-\nated. Some methodological factors deserve mentioning. Children\nwere invited to draw a picture of a child whose family was affected\nby AIDS and subsequently asked to tell a story about this child\u2019s life.\nIn doing so, nearly half of the children drew a child caring for\na bedridden parent e despite the fact that many PLWHAs (even in\nsituations where access to ARVs is limited, as at the time of this\nstudy) are not permanently bedridden and are able to engage in\ndomestic and income-generating activities between bouts of\nillness. Similar observations have been made by Gonzales-Rivera\nand Bauermeister (2007) in Puerto Rico.\nContrary to received wisdom about children\u2019s drawings, our\nexperience suggests that drawing, as a research methodology,\nmay encourage stereotypical representations e rather than\ngiving children opportunities to construct the more complex and\nnuanced types of accounts they gave in their written stories.\nFurthermore, in our informants\u2019 drawings, many of the faces of\nAIDS-affected children had happy smiles despite accompanying\nstories representing the child\u2019s lives as grim and exhausting. Our\nfindings suggest that researchers should be cautious in using\nchildren\u2019s drawings as a sole source of data, or in assuming that\ndrawings are the best way to elicit frank accounts of emotional\nissues. Drawings should be complemented by an interview\n(draw-and-tell) or a written story (draw-and-write) to clarify the\nchildren\u2019s own understandings of their drawings, and to open up\nspace for children to communicate the nuances and contradic-\ntions that characterise their understandings of complex\nsituations.\nC. Campbell et al. \/ Social Science & Medicine 71 (2010) 975e985984Furthermore, the content and tone of pictures and drawings\ntended to vary in our study. In general, drawings were more likely\nto focus on children as agents (caregivers, with positive attitudes\nand access to resources), whereas stories were more likely to focus\non the emotional and negative circumstances of AIDS-affected\nchildren (upset, despair, bullying). Much remains to be learned\nabout whether different media of communication (in our case\ndrawings versus written essays and verbal stories) tend to generate\nmore or less stereotypical representations, and positive or negative\ncontent.\nThere is a large developmental psychology literature that\nfocuses on how children\u2019s representations vary from one devel-\nopmental stage to another (Piaget, 1929; Vygotsky & Cole, 1978). In\nour studywe focused on children aged 10e12. As a follow-up to this\nstudy, we are keen to investigate how a wider range of age groups\nrepresent HIV\/AIDS.\nWe have found that children\u2019s combined drawings and essays\nadd a useful and more complex dimension to understandings of\nAIDS stigma amongst children e in a field previously dominated by\nquestionnaires, and by theoretical frameworks that focus on factors\ndriving stigma, which in the process neglect factors that may\nmitigate AIDS stigma. There is a need for observational and long-\nterm studies to unpick the complex relationship between indi-\nvidual and environmental factors that drive and mitigate children\u2019s\nstigma of other children.\nConclusion\nWe set out to explore children\u2019s representations of AIDS and\nAIDS-affected children to further our understandings of whether\nand how children stigmatise AIDS-affected children, and to identify\nresources for stigma-reduction programmes. In line with our view\nthat effective anti-stigma interventions are those that provide\nsocial spaces in which contrasting views and experiences can be\ndebated, we have identified a diverse range of representations of\nAIDS-affected children. Whilst they were overwhelmingly por-\ntrayed as rejected, over-burdened and tragic figures, they were also\npresented as deserving of respect and compassion. Our informants\nalso admiringly reflected how AIDS-affected children were able to\nnegotiate support and help in dealing with their burdens, and\nactively participate in sustaining their households and providing\ncare for their ailing parents.\nWe have no desire to downplay the degree of stigmatisation of\nAIDS-affected children, or to fail to acknowledge the immensity of\ntheir associated suffering. However we do believe that the co-\nexistence of more positive representations of AIDS-affected chil-\ndren alongside stigmatising ones e even amongst a minority of\nchildren e serves as a promising potential resource for stigma-\nreduction programmes. Ideally such programmes would go beyond\nsimply promoting HIV awareness through information provision, to\nfacilitating social spaces in which groups of children could engage\nin critical thinking and dialogue (cf. Vaughan, 2010) regarding\ndifferent ways of thinking about the stigmatised situation of their\nAIDS-affected peers. Such dialogue could serve as the first step for\nchildren\u2019s co-construction of more positive and supportive repre-\nsentations, through the process of acknowledging and developing\nelements of positive thinking that exist alongside more negative\nones. Social psychologists argue that programmes that enable\npeople to identify and debate alternative ways of making sense of\ntheir social worlds open up promising arenas for the questioning\nand reframing of stigmatising social representations (Campbell,\nNair, Maimane, & Nicholson, 2007). This is particularly the case\nwhen such debate is rooted in positive ways of thinking that\nalready exist within the group (albeit often in an implicit and\nfragmentary way, or only amongst a minority of group members)that may need to be brought to people\u2019s awareness before being\nused as a resource for challenging more negative views.\nThere are various compelling reasons for targeting stigma-\nreduction efforts at children, not only to reduce the suffering of\nAIDS-affected children, but also as an investment in the long-term\nchallenge of reducing stigma amongst all age groups. Anxieties\nrelating to sex and sexuality have been identified as key drivers of\nAIDS stigma (Campbell, Foulis, Maimane, & Sibiya, 2005). As argued\nabove, pre-teenage children who are not yet sexually active may be\nless powerfully subject to the emotions and anxieties, or the\nsymbolic taboos, frequently associated with mature sexual activity.\nAs such, the stigmatising representations held by children may be\nmore malleable and open to contestation and transformation than\nadult stigma. Furthermore, the admiration that did exist for AIDS-\naffected children in our study was related to the respect our infor-\nmants held for other children\u2019s caring roles. A study of AIDS care in\na rural community in South Africa found that the activity of caring\nfor people with AIDS was undervalued by adults, more particularly\nadult men (Campbell et al., 2009). If respect for caring is indeed a key\nresource for challenging stigma, it may have the most resonance\nwith children who are more likely to understand the high value of\ncaring than adults, who may have forgotten the feelings of depen-\ndency that characterise many aspects of childhood.\nSchools have been identified as key arenas for stigma-reduction\nprogrammes (Brown, Macintyre, & Trujilo, 2003). Schools are\nuniquely placed to offer supportive social spaces that provide and\nmobilise support as well as allow teachers and children to promote\nanti-discriminatory behaviours (Kendall & O\u2019Gara, 2007). Schools\nalso have the potential to creatively involve pupils in sexual and\nhealth education (Hoadley, 2007). Such education could go \u2018beyond\nawareness\u2019 to tackle some of the negative and sometimes irrational\nor inaccurate understandings of AIDS and AIDS-affected children\nthat mediated some of the negative representations held by chil-\ndren in our study. As the education system has the largest institu-\ntional network in many countries, school-based stigma-reduction\nprogrammes, using dialogical approaches to facilitate debate about\nalternative ways of making sense of the world, offer a unique\nopportunity for programmes seeking to reduce the bullying and\nstigmatisation of AIDS-affected children and PLWHA.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to all the research participants.
